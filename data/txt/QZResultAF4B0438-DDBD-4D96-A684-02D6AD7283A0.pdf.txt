Foxp3þ T Cells Inhibit Antitumor Immune Memory Modulated
by mTOR Inhibition
Yanping Wang1, Tim Sparwasser3, Robert Figlin2, and Hyung L. Kim1

Abstract
Inhibition of mTOR signaling enhances antitumor memory lymphocytes. However, pharmacologic mTOR
inhibition also enhances regulatory T-cell (Treg) activity. To counter this effect, Treg control was added to mTOR
inhibition in preclinical models. Tregs were controlled with CD4-depleting antibodies because CD4 depletion has
high translational potential and already has a well-established safety proﬁle in patients. The antitumor activity of
the combination therapy was CD8 dependent and controlled growth of syngeneic tumors even when an adoptive
immunotherapy was not used. Lymphocytes resulting from the combination therapy could be transferred into
na€ve mice to inhibit aggressive growth of lung metastases. The combination therapy enhanced CD8 memory
formation as determined by memory markers and functional studies of immune recall. Removal of FoxP3expressing T lymphocytes was the mechanism underlying immunologic memory formation following CD4
depletion. This was conﬁrmed using transgenic DEREG (depletion of regulatory T cells) mice to speciﬁcally
remove Foxp3þ T cells. It was further conﬁrmed with reciprocal studies where stimulation of immunologic
memory because of CD4 depletion was completely neutralized by adoptively transferring tumor-speciﬁc Foxp3þ
T cells. Also contributing to tumor control, Tregs that eventually recovered following CD4 depletion were less
immunosuppressive. These results provide a rationale for further study of mTOR inhibition and CD4 depletion in
patients. Cancer Res; 74(8); 2217–28. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The immune system can provide protection against cancers.
Effective immune stimulation produces long-lasting memory
lymphocytes, capable of rapidly responding to repeat antigen
challenge. The mTOR pathway is an important checkpoint that
governs the formation of CD8 memory cells (1–3). In mouse
models, decreased mTOR signaling promotes formation of
CD8 memory cells that provide protection against bacteria
(4), virus (1) or cancer (2, 3). This is surprising because
rapamycin, which is the prototypic mTOR inhibitor, is considered an immunosuppressant and is widely used to prevent
rejection of solid organ transplants. In murine models of renal
cell carcinoma (RCC) and melanoma, pharmacologic mTOR
inhibition had both immune stimulating and immune suppressing effects (2). However, the net effect resulted in
decreased tumor growth. Therefore, mTOR inhibitors, which

are already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical use, are a promising adjunct for use with
cancer vaccines.
Strategies to limit immune suppression by mTOR inhibitors
may make this class of drugs even more useful with cancer
vaccines. Pharmacologic mTOR inhibition suppresses the
immune system at least in part by enhancing CD4 regulatory
T-cell (Treg) activity (2, 5). Therefore, we explored a combination therapy targeting the mTOR pathway and Tregs. The
most reliable Treg marker is forkhead box transcription factor
(FoxP3), which is speciﬁc for Tregs and is required for its
function (6). Unfortunately, there is no clinical strategy for
targeting FoxP3-expressing cells in patients. Therefore, an
alternative strategy is to target CD25, which is expressed by
the majority of Tregs. However, this strategy has limitations
because some Tregs are CD25 negative. Furthermore, activated
CD8 lymphocytes express CD25 and can be depleted by CD25targeting strategies. In murine models, depleting CD25-expressing cells with aCD25 antibodies was effective in preventing
tumor growth, but was not effective in treating established
tumors (7–9) and has been shown to restrict adoptive immunotherapy (10, 11). Another strategy uses an engineered protein that combines interleukin-2 (IL-2) and diphtheria toxin
(denileukin diftitox, trade name Ontax) to target CD25-expressing cells. The approach has been tested in patients with RCC
or melanoma (12, 13), however clinical effectiveness was
limited, possibly because of depletion of CD8 effector cells.
Using preclinical models, we explored a combination of
pharmacologic mTOR inhibition and Treg depletion using

aCD4 antibody. This is an attractive approach because CD4depleting antibodies have been studies in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (14, 15), Crohn disease (16), and multiple
sclerosis (17, 18), and have a well-established safety proﬁle.
However, CD4 depletion removes CD4 effector cells, which are
required for initiation of an immune response. Therefore, CD4
depletion was timed to occur after immune priming has taken
place. In murine models for RCC and melanoma, mTOR
inhibition and CD4 depletion produced a robust cellular
immune response that was transferable and effective in controlling subcutaneous tumors as well as lung metastases. The
combination treatment produced highly effective memory
lymphocytes with robust recall responses. The stimulation of
immunological memory because of CD4 depletion was attributed to Treg depletion based on experiments using transgenic
models to speciﬁcally deplete Tregs ("Treg knock-out") or
replace tumor-speciﬁc Tregs ("Treg knock-in") following CD4
depletion. Another mechanism contributing to the antitumor
response was that Tregs that returned after CD4 depletion were
less immunosuppressive than Tregs from mice without CD4
manipulation.

Materials and Methods
Mice and tumor cells
Female C57BL/6J, Balb/c mice and Pmel-1 mice, 6- to 8-week
old, were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and housed
under pathogen-free conditions. FoxP3-GFP mice were a generous gift from Dr. V. Kuchroo (Harvard University, Boston,
MA). DEREG [depletion of regulatory T cells; Tg(Foxp3-DTR/
EGFP)23.2Spar] transgenic mice was generated and described
by T. Sparwasser (19). All experiments involving animals were
in compliance with federal and state standards, which include
the federal Animal Welfare Act and the NIH guide for the care
and use of laboratory animals.
Human gp100-transduced B 16 cells (B16-gp100) were kindly
provided by Dr. A. Rakhmilevich from University of WisconsinMadison. RENCA, a murine RCC line, was a gift from Dr. A.
Belldegrum (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). All cells
were periodically authenticated by morphologic and histologic
inspection, and animal grafting for assessing their ability to
grow and metastasize. Cells were annually tested for mycoplasma using Myco Alert Kit (Lonza). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle medium or RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Life
Technologies), 2 mmol/L of L-glutamine, 100 units/mL of
penicillin, and 100 mg/mL of streptomycin.
Mouse tumors were generated by subcutaneously injecting
2  105 cells into the ﬂank. Tumor diameter was measured with
calipers twice a week and tumor volume was calculated
(shortest diameter2  longest diameter/2). In the lung metastasis model, tumor cells were injected intravenously through
the tail vein. Lung metastases were counted using a dissection
microscope.
Antibodies and reagents
The following monoclonal antibodies (mAb), with or without a ﬂuorescent conjugate, were obtained from Biolegend:
anti-CD4 (GK 1.5 and RM4-5), anti-CD8 (53-6.7), anti-CD16/

CD32 (9.3), anti-CD90.1 (OX-7), anti-CD11c (N418), anti-Bcl2
(BCL/10C4), anti-T-bet (4B10), anti-CD62L (MEL-14), antiCD279 (PD-1,29F.1A12), anti-FoxP3 (FJK-16s), anti-IFN-g
(XMG1.2), anti-IL-2 (JES6.5H4), anti-IL-4 (11B11), IL-17A
(eBio1787). CellTrace 5-(and 6-)carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate
succinimidyl ester (CFSE) Cell Proliferation Kit was purchased
from Invitrogen. CD4 (GK1.5) and CD8 (2.43) antibodies for T
cells depletion were purchased from BioXcell. Temsirolimus
was purchased from LC Laboratory.
T-cell enrichment and Treg sorting
Mouse spleen and lymph nodes were collected and processed
into single-cell suspensions. CD8 and CD4 T cells were negatively enriched using mouse CD8 or CD4 recovery column kits
(Cedarlane Labs). Purity of CD8 and CD4 cells after negative
selection was greater than 85%. FoxP3-GFP cells or antibody
stained CD4þCD25þ cells were sorted by MoFlo Cell Sorter.
Preparation of dendritic cells and T-cell stimulation
Dendritic cell (DC) preparation has been described (2). To
prepare DC vaccine for treatment of mice, DCs were pulsed
with tumor cell lysate and activated with 10 mg/mL CpG. DCs
were subcutaneously injected into mouse. For in vitro activation of Pmel-1 cells, DC was pulsed with 10 ng/mL mouse gp100
peptide (amino acids 25–33, which is presented by H2-Db class
I molecules; Alpha Diagnostic International) and activated
with 10 mg/mL CpG for 2 hours. DC was washed with PBS,
and cocultured with CFSE-labeled Pmel-1 cells. Pmel-1 cells
proliferation was analyzed by FACscan.
Adoptive transfer, CD4 cells depletion, and mTOR
inhibition
Pmel-1 lymphocytes were isolated from lymph nodes and
spleen of na€ve Pmel-1 mice. CD8 lymphocytes were enriched
by negative selection using Cedarlane puriﬁcation column. At
least 85% of the resulting cells were CD8þ. A total of 5  105
cells were transferred into B57BL/6 mice. The day after adoptive transfer, mice received tumor lysate–pulsed DC vaccine.
To deplete CD4 cells, aCD4 was administered approximately
7 and 9 days later; mice were inject intraperitoneally with
250 mg of CD4 mAb (clone GK1.5). To deplete CD8 cells, mice
received 250 mg of CD8 mAb (clone 2.43). To deplete FoxP3 cells
in DEREG mice, 5 mg DT was injected. Flow cytometry was used
to conﬁrm depletion of target cells. For mTor inhibitor treatment, 15 mg temsirolimus was injected intraperitoneally each
day for 2 weeks. Flow cytometry was used to analyze memory
cells and Treg cells.
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte assay
The in vivo cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assay has been
described (2). For the in vitro CTL, fresh splenocytes were
cultured in the presence of IL-2 (40 IU/mL; eBioscience), tumor
lysate, and H-2K–restricted CA9 peptide (20) for 5 days. Live
cells were isolated with the Lympholyte Media (Cedarlane Labs)
and used as effector cells. To prepare target cells, RENCA cells
were treated with IFN-g (20 ng/mL; eBioscience) for 24 hours
and labeled with CFSE (0.5 mmol/L). Effector and target cells
were co-cultured at a ratio of 50:1 at 37 C for 12 hours. Cells were
stained with 7-AAD and PE labeled annexin V (eBioscience) on

ice for 20 minutes and analysed by ﬂow cytometry for percent of
7-AADþannexin V cells that were CFSEþ.
Statistics
Differences in tumor growth were assessed using repeating
measure ANOVA. Statistical differences were evaluated by 2tailed Student t test. All statistical analyzes were performed
using Stata 8.0 (StataCorp.). P values < 0.05 were considered
signiﬁcant.

Results
mTOR inhibition enhances antitumor immunity
In animal models, pharmacologic mTOR inhibition can
enhance the formation of immune memory, which can help
clear infections (1, 4) and decrease tumor growth (2, 3). This
was a surprising ﬁnding because mTOR inhibitors are used to
suppress the immune system in patients who have had solid
organ transplants. Temsirolimus is a rapamycin analog and
one of the ﬁrst mTOR inhibitors approved by the FDA as a
cancer treatment. In our preclinical model, mTOR inhibition
with temsirolimus enhanced the antitumor immunity of tumor
lysate–pulsed DCs (referred to here as DC vaccine; Fig. 1A).
Temsirolimus can directly inhibit the growth of some tumors
(2); therefore, a tumor prevention study was performed to
assess the immune effects of temsirolimus. By administering
DC vaccine and temsirolimus 13 days before tumor challenge,
there is no possibility for a direct antitumor effect, and any
decrease in tumor growth can be attributed to immune stimulation. Administering DC vaccine alone decreased growth of
B16 tumor cells in mice, however, most mice eventually died
because of tumor growth. In contrast, the combination of DC
vaccine and temsirolimus resulted in 100% survival and
completely prevented the growth of B16 tumor cells.
To assess the immune effect of temsirolimus on speciﬁc CD8
lymphocytes, Thy1.1 Pmel-1 lymphocytes were adoptively
transferred into Thy1.2 B6 mice (Fig. 1B and C). Pmel-1
transgenic mice carry a rearranged T-cell receptor that recognizes a gp100 epitope (amino acids 25–33) presented by H2-Db
MHC class I molecules. Lymphocytes were harvested from B6
mice after they were treated with DC vaccine and temsirolimus.
Temsirolimus had both immune stimulating and immune
suppressing effects when administered with the DC vaccine.
Temsirolimus slightly decreased the percent of CD8 cells that
were Pmel-1 lymphocytes (P-value ¼ 0.08), however, Pmel-1
lymphocytes had increased expression of Eomes, which is an
early marker for memory cell formation (3, 21). Potentially
immune suppressive effects included a decrease in Tbet
expression in Pmel-1 lymphocytes and increase in Tregs. These
observations were largely mirrored by in vitro mixed lymphocyte culture studies (Fig. 1D and E). In the in vitro studies,
temsirolimus signiﬁcantly decreased the proliferation of Pmel1 lymphocytes induced by the DC vaccine.
CD4 depletion enhanced the antitumor effect of mTor
inhibition
Temsirolimus produced a net antitumor immune response
despite an increase in Tregs. Furthermore, the presence of
tumor itself increased Tregs (Supplementary Fig. S1). There-

fore, we hypothesized that the antitumor immunity induced by
mTOR inhibition can be further enhanced by targeting Tregs.
Currently, there is no clinical strategy to selectively remove
Tregs; however, it is feasible to deplete all CD4 lymphocytes.
However, CD4 effector cells are required for immune activation. Therefore, in mouse models, CD4 lymphocytes were
depleted with aCD4 IgG2b antibody (aCD4) after immune
stimulation by the implanted tumor (Fig. 2).
We tested this approach in a second model of RCC, another
classically immune-sensitive tumor. In a tumor treatment
model, palpable RENCA tumors were established in Balb/c
mice (Fig. 2). Temsirolimus has been shown to have direct
cytostatic growth inhibition of RENCA tumor cells in vitro (2),
and as expected temsirolimus alone was effective in decreasing
tumor growth in our mouse model (Fig. 2A). However, when
temsirolimus was stopped, the tumor started growing again
(data not shown). Addition of aCD4 to temsirolimus treatment
further decreased tumor growth and was even curative while
aCD4 alone had no effect. It is interesting to note that the
combination of aCD4 and temsirolimus decreased tumor
growth even when no cancer vaccine was used and the
implanted tumor was the only source of speciﬁc immune
stimulation.
In the same experiment, lymphocytes were harvested on day
45 and assessed for tumor-speciﬁc IFN-g response (Fig. 2B) and
CTL killing (Fig. 2C). In tumor-bearing mice that received no
treatment, there was no IFN-g or killing response. Treatment
with either aCD4 or temsirolimus produced some IFN-g or
killing response; however, the combination treatment produced the largest responses. To characterize the CD4 lymphocyte depletion in response to aCD4, na€ve mice were treated
with a single dose of aCD4. Nearly all CD4 cells were depleted
from the peripheral blood, spleen, and lymph nodes by the next
day (Fig. 2D) whereas CD8 cells were preserved (Fig. 2E).
Importantly, FoxP3þCD4þ cells were depleted and remained
low even 10 days following administration of aCD4 (Fig. 2F). A
single dose of aCD4 reduced the population of all CD4 subsets
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
There are known differences in the immune system of Balb/c
and B6 mice (22). However, a similar antitumor effect was
observed with our proposed therapy in B6 mice with established B16 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S3). Unlike RENCA, the
B16 tumors are not directly inhibited by temsirolimus (2).
Therefore, antitumor effects seen in the presence of mTOR
inhibition are likely produced by the immune system. Another
consideration is that B16 tumors grow very rapidly, and most
mice require euthanasia within 3 weeks of tumor implantation.
Therefore, DC vaccines were used in our tumor treatment
models to decrease B16 growth rates and give our treatments
sufﬁcient time to stimulate the immune system.
Combination of CD4 depletion and temsirolimus
generated antitumor immunity that was dependent on
memory CD8 cells
Because temsirolimus can directly inhibit RENCA cells, it
was important to establish that the combination of aCD4 and
temsirolimus was generating an effective antitumor immunity
dependent on CD8 lymphocytes. Balb/c mice bearing RENCA

tumors were treated with temsirolimus alone for 10 days
and then challenged with a second RENCA tumor (Fig. 3A).
Mice injected with aCD8 antibody (aCD8) to deplete CD8
effectors cells had increased growth of the second RENCA
tumor, indicating that even temsirolimus alone works at
least in part by stimulating an immune response. The
combination of temsirolimus and aCD4 completely prevented the growth of second RENCA tumors; however,
aCD8 removed the antitumor effect on the second tumors,
indicating the importance of cellular immunity to tumor
control (Fig. 3B).
To further establish the role of the immune system and test
our proposed treatment in a more aggressive tumor model, we

assessed whether antitumor immunity can be transferred to
prevent growth of metastatic lung deposits. The combination
of aCD4 and temsirolimus was used to treat established,
subcutaneous RENCA tumors (Fig. 3C). Lymphocytes from
these mice were adoptively transferred to na€ve mice, which
were challenged intravenously with RENCA cells. The combination treatment signiﬁcantly decreased the establishment
and growth of lung deposits (Fig. 3C) as quantiﬁed by comparing lung weights (Fig. 3D) and counting lung deposits (Fig.
3E). Speciﬁc IFN-g expression in CD8 lymphocytes was
increased in the combination therapy group (Fig. 3F). Therefore, memory cells were successfully transferred into na€ve
mice, where they helped control tumor growth.

Combination of CD4 depletion and temsirolimus
treatment enhanced function of CD8 memory cells
An important mechanism through which temsirolimus
inhibits tumor growth is to enhance the quality of speciﬁc
CD8 memory (1, 2). Therefore, we characterized the quality of
CD8 memory cells with the goal of assessing whether aCD4
further enhances the speciﬁc CD8 memory formed in the
presence of mTOR inhibition. We used a model where DC
vaccines stimulated an immune response rather than the
tumor itself because the duration of experiments with
tumor-bearing mice is limited by rapid tumor growth in the
control groups. By using a DC vaccine, long-term memory can

be assessed, including recall responses. Thy1.1 Pmel-1 lymphocytes were adoptively transferred into B6 mice, which were
then challenged with B16-DC vaccine and treated with aCD4
and temsirolimus (Fig. 4A).
To assess memory cells, splenocytes were harvest before
(Fig. 4B) or after (Fig. 4C) rechallenging mice with DC
vaccine on day 46. Immediately because rechallenge, there
was no signiﬁcant difference in percent of Pmel-1 lymphocytes in the experimental groups (Fig. 4B). However, the CD8
lymphocytes from mice treated with both aCD4 and temsirolimus had signiﬁcantly higher expression of memory markers Eomes and BCL2. The CD8 lymphocytes from this group

had signiﬁcantly higher expression of CD62L, which is a
marker for highly effective central memory cells. Consistent
with high-quality memory cells, following rechallenge with
DC vaccine, the Pmel-1 cells in the combination treatment
group had the greatest expansion and CD8 cells had the
highest Tbet and IL-2 expression (Fig. 4C). Interestingly,
even after rechallenge, the expanded CD8 cells from the
combination treatment group had the highest expression of
Eomes.
Others have reported that Tregs are necessary, during
immune priming, for CD8 memory formation (23, 24). Therefore, in our treatment models, Tregs were depleted at least 6
days after primary immune stimulation. However, we veriﬁed
the importance of having CD4 cells during immune priming.
When CD4 depletion was performed before immune priming,
CD8 memory formation was poor, as indicated by a weak

tumor-speciﬁc CD8 expansion after stimulation of memory
cells and low Eomes expression (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Depleting or replacing Foxp3 Treg cells alter CTL
function in vivo
Our original hypothesis was that depletion of Tregs normally
induced by temsirolimus will enhance antitumor immunity.
We selected CD4 depletion as a strategy for depleting Tregs
because CD4 depletion is feasible in patients. However, we
wanted to test whether the effect of CD4 depletion can be
directly attributed to Tregs depletion. Therefore, we used
DEREG transgenic mice, which carry a DTR-eGFP transgene
under the control of Foxp3 promoter, allowing speciﬁc depletion of Tregs by administering diphtheria toxin (19). In an
experiment analogous to one shown in Fig. 2, diphtheria toxin
was administered on days 6 and 10, in place of aCD4 (Fig. 5A).

removed nearly all CD4þFoxP3þ lymphocytes (Fig. 5B). Speciﬁc killing and IFN-g staining signiﬁcantly increased in mice
treated with diphtheria toxin and temsirolimus when compared with control groups (Fig. 5C and D). Therefore, removing
Tregs had a similar immune effect to CD4 depletion.
To fully establish Treg depletion as the underlying mechanism for immune stimulation following CD4 depletion, Tregs
were replaced after CD4 depletion (Fig. 6A). Mice treated with
aCD4 and temsirolimus developed the best-speciﬁc immune
memory as assessed by in vivo CTL (Fig. 6B). However, when
Tregs from mice treated with diphtheria toxin vaccine were
adoptively transferred, speciﬁc killing and CD8 lymphocyte
IFN-g response decreased to that of control mice that only
received the DC vaccine (Fig. 6B and C). These experiments
conﬁrm that with aCD4 it is the Treg depletion that enhances
speciﬁc immune memory formation.

number of Tregs in the spleen were not statistically significant. However, the treatments may have had a long-term
effect on Treg function. Therefore, we assessed the immunosuppressive function of the recovered Tregs. CD4 lymphocytes were sorted based on CD25 status (Fig. 7B). The
vast majority of the CD4þCD25þ cells were FoxP3 positive
and were considered Tregs, and the vast majority of CD4þ
CD25 cells were FoxP3 negative and were considered CD4
effector cells. In functional studies, control CD4þCD25þ cells
suppressed the proliferation of CD8 lymphocytes. However,
CD4þCD25þ that recovered after CD4 depletion were less
immunosuppressive, possibly because they were less likely
to be tumor-speciﬁc Tregs (Fig. 7D). Interestingly, following
CD4 depletion, the recovered CD4 effector cells were also
less effective as indicated by lower IFN-g and IL-4 production (Fig. 7C). It is possible that both CD4 effector cells and
Tregs were less likely to be tumor speciﬁc.

eventually recovers is less immunosuppressive

for the treatment of melanoma (26). Immune checkpoint
inhibitors that target CTLA4 and PD-1 are being actively
investigated in a large number of clinical trials for various
malignancies. There have always been hints that immunebased therapies can even be curative in subsets of patients with
metastatic disease (27), but recent advances in immunotherapy reafﬁrm that durable complete responses are possible (28).
Therefore, immunotherapy is one of the most promising
approaches to cancer therapy.
A hallmark of durable immune responses is the generation of
immune memory. The mTOR pathway has emerged as a
critical determinant of immune memory (1–3). We conﬁrmed
prior observations that pharmacologic mTOR inhibition with
temsirolimus can enhance the efﬁcacy of adoptive immunotherapy (Fig. 1). Temsirolimus enhanced the expression of CD8
lymphocyte markers associated with memory formation, both
in vivo and in vitro. However, it also increased the proportion of
T cells expressing FoxP3. This was an expected ﬁnding because
the canonical mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, is routinely used in
the clinic as an immune suppressant, and its primarily mode of
action is believed to be through enhanced Treg activity (29, 30).
We reasoned that a combination therapy that includes a
strategy to control Tregs would further enhance antitumor
immunity. We elected to use a depleting aCD4 antibody
because of its potential for clinical translation. The combination of aCD4 and temsirolimus was highly effective in controlling established RENCA tumors even when a cancer-speciﬁc vaccine was not used (Fig. 2). Temsirolimus is known to

2224

Cancer Res; 74(8) April 15, 2014

directly inhibit the growth of RENCA cells (2); therefore, we
assessed the immune contribution to the antitumor effect. By
depleting CD8 cells, antitumor activity was shown to be
dependent on CD8 cells (Fig. 3). Further conﬁrmation of
immune stimulation was provided by transferring CD8 lymphocytes from treated mice to na€ve mice. In a very aggressive
tumor model, the transferred lymphocytes were effective in
controlling growth of metastatic deposits.
Temsirolimus enhanced CD8 memory formation. Therefore,
we assessed memory formation with the combination of
temsirolimus and aCD4 (Fig. 4). The combination therapy
produced CD8 lymphocytes with the strongest memory phenotype, capable of rapidly expanding in response to a repeat
antigen challenge. Although Tregs have been described as a
barrier to formation of antitumor memory (31), other recent
studies indicate that Tregs are required during immune priming to generate high-avidity primary responders and functional
CD8 memory (23, 24). In our model, Tregs were present during
immune priming because CD4 depletion was initiated at least 6
days after immune stimulation.
CD4 depletion was also timed to allow CD4 effector cells to
help prime CD8 cells and contribute to memory lymphocyte
formation (Figs. 2–4). During immune priming, CD4 activity is
dominated by helper function. Although it has been reported
that CD4 cells are not required for priming, they are required
for effective CD8 memory formation (32–34). CD8 memory
cells formed in the absence of CD4 cells had an exhausted
phenotype and increased PD-1 expression (32, 34). In our study,

A, experimental scheme: B6 received tumor lysate–pulsed DC vaccine, and were treated intraperitoneally with aCD4 antibody on days 6 and 10,
and daily temsirolimus on days 14 to 24 (n ¼ 6 per group). Tregs, sorted from lymphocytes from GFP-FoxP3 mice that received tumor lysate–pulsed DC
vaccine (pooled from 3 mice), were adoptively transferred on day 20 and in vivo CTL assay was performed on day 35. B, the in vivo CTL results were analyzed by
ﬂow cytometry using splenocytes harvested 14 hours following injection of target cells (n ¼ 3–6 per group). Results are representative of duplicate
experiments. C, on day 45, mice were restimulated with DC vaccine and splenocytes were stained for CD8 and IFN-g expression. Histogram, mean  SEM.

the CD8 memory cells formed in the absence of CD4 were
less capable of responding to a second challenge and had
lower Eomes expression (Supplementary Fig. S4). Following
immune priming, CD4 activity is dominated by regulatory
function. Therefore, we and others have shown that CD4
depletion at this point leads to enhanced formation of both
central and effector CD8 memory (35) and enhanced tumor
control (35, 36).
Prior studies have assumed that the effects of CD4 depletion
were because of Treg depletion. In this study, we use 2 separate
experiments to empirically identify Treg depletion as the
underlying mechanism: we selectively depleted FoxP3 expressing cells ("knock-down") or replaced FoxP3 expressing cells
following CD4 depletion ("knock-in"; Figs. 5 and 6). These
experiments clearly identify Treg depletion as the mechanism

www.aacrjournals.org

accounting for enhanced immunity following CD4 depletion.
Interestingly, intratumor Treg depletion has been identiﬁed at
the primary mode of action for ipilimumab (37), which has
been proven effective in a phase III trial of melanoma (38).
Therefore, an intriguing possibility is that CD4 depletion may
produce a similar immune effect in patients as ipilimumab.
Our study provides a preclinical rationale for CD4 depletion
in patients. Multiple clinical trials have already documented
the safety of CD4 depletion in humans (14, 15, 17, 39–44). Near
complete CD4 depletion was achieved in several trials of
chimeric aCD4 antibodies for refractory cutaneous T-cell
lymphoma, and no serious infections or other dose-related
toxicities were noted (14, 15, 44). A CD4-depleting chimeric
monoclonal antibody was evaluated in 2 separate randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled studies for rheumatoid

arthritis (41, 43). Although CD4 depletion did not have a
therapeutic effect for rheumatoid arthritis, there were no
signiﬁcant adverse event, and no patient suffered from opportunistic infections. Even long-term CD4 depletion seems to be
safe because some patients in one of the trials were treated
with aCD4 for more than 9 months (43). After completing CD4depleting treatment, patients have been followed for safety: 24
patients were followed for 30 months and no opportunistic
infections or other signiﬁcant adverse effects were seen (40). In
addition, strong support for the safety of CD4 depletion comes
from a clinical trial where CD4 depletion was added to a

2226

standard immunosuppressive regiment in heart transplant
patients. These are patients where standard therapy already
puts them at high risk for opportunistic infections. Patients in
the CD4 depletion group actually had fewer episodes of infection than patients receiving standard immunosuppression
(39).
Several studies have tried to explain why CD4 depletion had
no therapeutic effect for autoimmune disorders. In multiple
clinical trials, aCD4 preferentially depleted na€ve CD4 cells and
tended to preserve memory CD4 cells (17, 45, 46). One study
estimated that unprimed CD4 cells were 3 times more sensitive

to depletion than primed CD4 cells (45). This feature is
desirable for cancer immunotherapy. In addition, CD4 depletion decreased the number of IL-4–producing Th2 cells whereas the number of IFN-g–producing Th1 cells remained stable,
thus signiﬁcantly increasing the Th1/Th2 ratio. In our animal
model, we also noted that the percent of IL-2–producing Th1
cells increased following CD4 depletion because of larger drops
in number of Th2 and Th17 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Therefore, the persistence of Th1 memory cells, along with CD8
memory cells, may explain the lack of beneﬁt when treating
chronic autoimmune disease. However, previously primed
memory cells are beneﬁcial for cancer immunotherapy where
Th1 and CD8 memory cells contribute to antitumor immunity.
Another important observation in preclinical tumor models
is that even partial CD4 depletion may be effective for enhancing the efﬁcacy of cancer vaccines (47). Following CD4 depletion, CD4 counts and Tregs recover. However, the Tregs that
recover were less immunosuppressive (Fig. 7). Antigen-speciﬁc
Tregs have been reported to suppress antitumor immunity
(48) and it is possible that the recovered Tregs may be less
likely to be tumor speciﬁc.
The possibility of combining a CD4 antibody with mTOR
inhibitors, which are already commercially available to treat
cancers, is attractive. The tumor itself may provide sufﬁcient
antigen stimulation and additional adoptive immunotherapy

may not be needed. The combination therapy seems to
enhance immune memory and remove Tregs. A clear understanding of the mechanism-of-action of the proposed therapy
helps bolster the rationale for further clinical investigation.
