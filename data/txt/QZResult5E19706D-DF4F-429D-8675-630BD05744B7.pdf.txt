Abstract
HHMI Author Manuscript
HHMI Author Manuscript

Somatic mutations in the small GTPase K-Ras are the most common activating lesions found in
human cancer, and are generally associated with poor response to standard therapies1–3. Efforts to
target this oncogene directly have faced difficulties owing to its picomolar affinity for GTP/GDP4
and the absence of known allosteric regulatory sites. Oncogenic mutations result in functional
activation of Ras family proteins by impairing GTP hydrolysis5,6. With diminished regulation by
GTPase activity, the nucleotide state of Ras becomes more dependent on relative nucleotide
affinity and concentration. This gives GTP an advantage over GDP7 and increases the proportion
of active GTP-bound Ras. Here we report the development of small molecules that irreversibly
bind to a common oncogenic mutant, K-Ras(G12C). These compounds rely on the mutant cysteine
for binding and therefore do not affect the wild-type protein. Crystallographic studies reveal the
formation of a new pocket that is not apparent in previous structures of Ras, beneath the effector
binding switch-II region. Binding of these inhibitors to K-Ras(G12C) disrupts both switch-I and
switch-II, subverting the native nucleotide preference to favour GDP over GTP and impairing
binding to Raf. Our data provide structure-based validation of a new allosteric regulatory site on
Ras that is targetable in a mutant-specific manner.

To target K-Ras(G12C) we took advantage of the unique nucleophilicity of cysteine thiols
by exploring cysteine-reactive small molecules. This strategy has the added advantage of
allowing selectivity for the mutant over wild-type K-Ras. Notably, the mutant Cys 12 sits in
close proximity to both the nucleotide pocket and the switch regions involved in effector
interactions (Fig. 1a). To identify a chemical starting point, we used a disulphide-fragmentbased screening approach called tethering8. We screened a library of 480 tethering
compounds against K-Ras(G12C) in the GDP state using intact protein mass
spectrometry9,10 (see Methods and Extended Data Table 1). Fragments 6H05 (94 ± 1%
(mean ± s.d.)) and 2E07 (84.6± 0.3%)gave the greatest degree of modification (Fig. 1b, c).
Reaction with wild-type K-Ras, which contains three native cysteine residues, was not
detected. Conversely, both compounds modify the oncogenic G12C mutant of the highly
homologous protein H-Ras11,12 (Fig. 1b). Binding was not diminished by 1 mM GDP in the
presence of EDTA, suggesting that the compounds bind in an allosteric site not overlapping
with GDP. Pre-loading of K-Ras with GTP significantly impairs modification by both
compounds, indicating incompatibility between compound binding and the active
conformation of Ras.

We chose to pursue the top fragment, 6H05, by investigating structure–activity relationships
for several analogues8 (Fig. 1c, see Methods). Some changes such as replacing the thioether
with a methylene group reduced binding (1, relative potency <0.1). However, other changes
such as modification of the tethering linker enhanced binding (6, relative potency 4.2).
Having identified a tractable chemotype, we pursued a co-crystal structure to enable
structure-based design. To facilitate uniform labelling on Cys 12 we used a K-Ras construct
lacking other cysteines, K-Ras(C51S/C80L/C118S) (known as Cys-light), which showed
minimal effects on overall protein structure (G12C versus Cys-light, root mean squared
deviation (r.m.s.d.) (Cα) = 0.33 Å). Using this construct, we obtained a 1.29 Å co-crystal
structure of 6 bound to K-Ras(G12C) in the GDP state (Fig. 1d). Compound 6 does not bind
in the nucleotide pocket but extends from Cys 12 into an adjacent pocket composed largely
of switch-II. This fully formed pocket is not apparent in other published structures of Ras,
although a groove is visible in some cases13 (Extended Data Fig. 1b), and previous studies
have suggested the presence of an allosteric site in this region14. We refer to the compound
binding region as the switch-II pocket (S-IIP).

HHMI Author Manuscript

The S-IIP is located between the central β-sheet of Ras, and the α2-(switch-II) and α3helices. Well-defined electron density shows the location of 6 deep within the S-IIP (432 Å2
interface; Extended Data Table 2) and confirms the disulphide linkage between 6 and Cys
12 (Fig. 1e; Fo − Fc at 2.5σ). The hydrophobic dichlorophenyl group of 6 makes several
hydrophobic contacts (Fig. 1f). Glu 99 and Gly 60 form direct hydrogen bonds to 6.
Whereas switch-II shows significant reordering to form the S-IIP, the conformation of
switch-I is unchanged from the GDP-bound state. Structural analysis also suggested the
presence of sub-pockets in S-IIP that might enable design of more potent inhibitors
(Extended Data Fig. 2a, (o-) and (p-)).
Rather than continue with disulphide-based compounds we turned to carbon-based
electrophiles, acrylamides and vinyl sulphonamides, which are still chemoselective yet
provide irreversible cysteine bond formation. We synthesized nearly 100 analogues guided

by iterative structural evaluation to yield substantial improvements in potency (Fig. 2a–c and
Supplementary Table 1). Owing to the irreversible nature of binding, potency was assessed
by time-dependent modification of the protein, initially 200 μM compound for 24 h. A shift
to 10 μM compound was necessary to differentiate optimized analogues (Extended Data
Table 3 and Extended Data Fig. 3a), reaching the detection limit of the assay (4 μM K-Ras).
Although vinyl sulphonamides generally performed better by these metrics, probably owing
to higher reactivity15, we obtained highly effective acrylamides as well (Fig. 2b).
To evaluate the off-target specificity of our most potent acrylamide 12, we used intact
protein mass spectrometry to monitor simultaneously for modification of K-Ras(G12C) and
bovine serum albumin (BSA) (one free cysteine) in a single mixture. Treatment with 12
resulted in the modification of K-Ras(G12C) but not BSA (Extended Data Fig. 3b), although
both react with Ellman’s reagent (also known as DTNB) (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Optimized
electrophiles show no detectable modification of wild-type K-Ras (Extended Data Fig. 3d).
Fragments lacking the electrophile did not impair binding of compound 12 to K-Ras(G12C)
(data not shown), suggesting limited binding to S-IIP in K-Ras proteins lacking the G12C
mutation.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Overlaying multiple co-crystal structures revealed that the compounds follow a similar
trajectory through the pocket and project functional groups into the (o-) and (p-) sub-pockets
(Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2). Despite considerable variation at the terminal phenyl
ring, the compounds satisfy similar hydrophobic interactions, supporting the crucial role of
this region of the S-IIP (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 2).
In the active state of Ras, residues from switch-II entirely fill the S-IIP (Fig. 2d). Co-crystal
structures with tethering compound 6 and the electrophile 8 exhibit displacement of switchII relative to the active conformation (Fig. 2e, f). Comparison of these co-crystal structures
revealed distinct effects on switch-I and switch-II. Tethering compound 6 induces a small
displacement of switch-II with little effect on switch-I. By contrast, electrophile 8 induces a
more pronounced displacement of switch-II that results in disordering of switch-I and a lack
of density for the metal ion.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Proper metal coordination is crucial for tight nucleotide binding16, with mutation of
magnesium-coordinating residues Ser 17 or Asp 57 leading to a preference for GDP over
GTP17,18. Many of our structures with carbon-based electrophiles show disordering of
switch-I and a lack of density for the metal ion (Extended Data Table 4). On the basis of
these observations, we predicted that S-IIP binding compounds might differentially affect
nucleotide affinities leading to a preference for GDP over GTP. To test this prediction, we
carried out EDTA-catalysed off-exchange reactions with 2′-deoxy-3′-O-(Nmethylanthraniloyl) (mant)-dGDP, while titrating unlabelled GDP or GTP (Fig. 3). In the
absence of inhibitor, K-Ras(G12C) shows a slight preference for GTP (relative affinity 0.6 ±
0.2), as reported previously for H-Ras7. However, in the presence of either 8 or 12, GTP
affinity is significantly decreased relative to GDP (relative affinity 3.9 ± 0.6 (8) and 3.5 ±
0.8 (12), P = 0.004, t-test) (Fig. 3b, c). The catalysis of nucleotide exchange by EDTA
suggests that although our compounds may subtly affect metal binding leading to changes in
nucleotide affinity, Mg2+ is not precluded even when the S-IIP is occupied.

Structural analysis also predicts that the function of the exchange factor SOS would be
compromised by compound binding to S-IIP19. Indeed, treatment of K-Ras(G12C) with
either 8 or 12 blocks SOS-catalysed nucleotide exchange (Fig. 4a–e). As shown above, these
compounds do not impair EDTA-catalysed GDP exchange.
In the active conformation of Ras, Gly 60 and Thr 35 make crucial contacts with the γphosphate20. Conservative mutations of Thr 35 (T35S) or Gly 60 (G60A) markedly impair
effector binding21,22. Our compounds occupy the required position for Gly 60 in the active
conformation and displace this residue to varying degrees, with larger distances correlating
with disordering of switch-I (Extended Data Table 4 and Extended Data Fig. 4). This
analysis led to the prediction that our compounds would disrupt the conformation of the
GTP state of Ras and impair interactions with effectors such as Raf. We measured Ras–Raf
association in two K-Ras(G12C)-mutant lung cancer cell lines, H1792 and H358, using coimmunoprecipitation. As predicted, treatment with 12 decreased the association of B-Raf
and C-Raf with Ras (Fig. 4f). Although this effect is evident in both cell lines, it is most
pronounced in H1792 cells, which express lower levels of Ras23.

Despite limited compound potency, we speculated that the genotype-specificity might afford
a therapeutic window for the targeted inhibition of K-Ras(G12C) in cellular models.
Therefore, we compared the effects of 12 in a small collection of genetically annotated lung
cancer cell lines. As expected, the group of cell lines containing G12C mutations (H1792,
H358, H23 and Calu-1) showed decreased viability (Fig. 4g and Extended Data Fig. 5; P =
0.005, t-test) and increased apoptosis (Fig. 4h; P <0.001, t-test) relative to the group lacking
this mutation (H1437, H1299 and A549) after treatment with 12. The highly sensitive
H1792 cells show low levels of K-Ras GTP (Extended Data Fig. 5b), consistent with
preferential binding of our inhibitors to K-Ras GDP (Fig. 1b), and they are highly K-Ras
dependent24 (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Notably, both K-Ras-dependent (A549) and independent (H1299) cell lines lacking G12C were insensitive to compound 12 (Fig. 4g, h
and Extended Data Fig. 5). The half-maximum effective concentration (EC50) for compound
12 in H1792 cells (0.32 ± 0.01 μM) is tenfold lower than that of compound 10 (3.2 ± 0.4
μM), consistent with in vitro K-Ras labelling efficiency (Fig. 2b, 100% versus 14% labelling
at 24 h). Notably, the highly related electrophile-containing compound 17, which does not
modify K-Ras(G12C) in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 2c, 0% at 24 h), shows no effect on
H1792 cell viability. Overall, our cellular data provide a proof-of-concept for the genotypespecific use of S-IIP binding compounds in K-Ras(G12C)-driven cancer.
Using a structure-guided approach to target the G12C mutant of K-Ras, we have identified a
new allosteric pocket, S-IIP, in this protein, and we have used that pocket to develop
irreversible, mutant-specific inhibitors of Ras function. The S-IIP is not visible in other
structures of Ras, and thus it is probably highly dynamic when GDP is bound, until initial
encounter with our compounds. Compound binding to S-IIP impairs Ras function through
two distinct mechanisms. First, by shifting the relative nucleotide affinities of Ras to favour
GDP over GTP, the compounds should lead to accumulation of Ras in the inactive state.
Notably, the two most effective cellular GTPase inhibitors, the natural products brefeldin A
and YM-254890, both bind to and stabilize a GDP-bound state of their respective
GTPases25,26. So far, published small molecules that bind Ras have not shown this

nucleotide preference14,27–29. Second, compounds occupying S-IIP diminish interactions
with effectors and regulatory proteins. This should act to diminish signalling by K-Ras
further. Despite the need for continued chemical optimization of our compounds for future
assessment in vivo, initial evaluation of our compounds in lung cancer cell lines suggests
allele-specific impairment of K-Ras function. On the basis of these data and our
understanding of the biochemical mechanism of the inhibitors, we are confident that our
findings can serve as the starting point for drug-discovery efforts targeting K-Ras(G12C)
and eventually other alleles of K-Ras.

METHODS
Protein expression and purification

HHMI Author Manuscript

Hexahistidine-tagged recombinant human K-Ras (isoform 2, residues 1–169, based on
construct used for PDB accession 3GFT) was transformed into Escherichia coli (BL21
(DE3)). After the bacterial growth to an attenuance (D) at 600 nm of 0.4–0.6 in Terrific
Broth containing 30 mg l−1 kanamycin at 37 °C, induction was carried out at 18 °C using 0.5
mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG), and growth was continued at 18 °C for about 18
h. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation, and the obtained pellet either stored at −80
°C or used freshly for the subsequent steps.

HHMI Author Manuscript

The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0 and 5 mM
imidazole) containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche complete EDTA free), the bacteria
were lysed by microfluidizer, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol (βME) (final) was added and cell
debris was removed by ultracentrifugation. The supernatant was incubated for 1 h with Coaffinity beads (Clontech, ~2 ml bed volume per 1 l initial culture), the loaded beads were
then washed with lysis buffer containing 2 mM βME and the protein was eluted with buffer
containing 125–250 mM imidazole. The hexahistidine tag was then cleaved using
hexahistidine-tagged TEV-protease (1 mg recombinant TEV per 25 mg crude K-Ras, 1 mg
GDP added per 20 mg crude K-Ras) while dialysing against a buffer containing 300 mM
NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mM imidazole, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.5 mM
EDTA. The cleaved protein was then diluted fivefold with low-salt buffer (50 mM NaCl, 20
mM Tris, pH 8.0), incubated with Ni-agarose beads (Qiagen) to remove uncleaved protein
and protease, and 5 mM MgCl2 and GDP was added to load the metal and nucleotide site of
K-Ras fully.
The crude protein was then purified by ion-exchange chromatography (HiTrap Q HP
column, salt gradient from 50 to 500 mM NaCl) to give the partially purified protein,
commonly in the following buffer (~230 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, small amounts of
GDP). At this point the protein was either fully labelled with the desired compound
(incubation overnight with an excess of compound at 4 °C, labelling checked by mass
spectrometry analysis), frozen down and stored at −80 °C, or used for further purification.
The last purification step for the labelled or unlabelled protein was gel filtration using either
a Superdex 75 or 200 column (10/300 GL) with the following buffer: 20 mM HEPES, pH
7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT (for the unlabelled proteins). The freshly prepared and

purified protein was then concentrated to 5–20 mg ml−1 and used for the X-ray
crystallography trays.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Sequences for the different K-Ras constructs were generally codon-optimized and
synthesized by DNA2.0 using the pJexpress411 vector. For the X-ray structures of
compound-labelled K-Ras(G12C), a cysteine-light mutant was used (K-Ras (G12C/C51S/
C80L/C118S)) to enable more uniformly labelled species.
Purification and labelling of full-length forms of the protein as well as H-Ras was carried
out analogously. Nucleotide exchange for crystallographic samples was carried out
following published procedures4,27,30.
Tethering screen
Untagged recombinant K-Ras(G12C) (1–169) at 1 μM was reacted with 100 μM fragment
and 100 μM βME in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM EDTA for 1 h at
ambient temperature. The extent of modification was assessed by electrospray mass
spectrometry using a Waters LCT-Premier LC/ESI-MS. By setting a threshold of ≥60%
modification, we achieved a hit rate of 1.9%.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Determination of DR50 and relative potency of fragments
The DR50 is determined by titrating fragment while maintaining a constant βME
concentration, in this case 200 μM βME. DR50 = [βME]/[fragment], at which 50%
modification is achieved by total protein mass spectrometry10. Relative potency is reported
as: fragment DR50/6H05 DR50.
Mass spectrometric screen for extent of irreversible labelling

HHMI Author Manuscript

Untagged recombinant K-Ras(G12C) (1–169) at 4 μM was reacted with inhibitors at 200 μM
or 10 μM (2% (v/v) dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) final) in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. After 24 h, 10-μl aliquots were removed and the reactions were
stopped by the addition of 1 μl 2% (v/v) formic acid. For the BSA specificity experiment, 16
μM BSA was included in the mixture and the reaction was analysed at 6 h, without acid
treatment. A similar mixture of K-Ras(G12C) and BSA was treated instead with 200 μM
Ellman’s reagent and labelling was analysed after 5 min. In all cases, the extent of
modification was assessed by electrospray mass spectrometry using a Waters Acquity
UPLC/ESI-TQD with a 2.1 × 50 mm Acquity UPLC BEH300 C4 column.
Plate-based assay to determine relative affinity of K-Ras for GDP or GTP
The corresponding recombinantly expressed, full-length K-Ras protein (G12C mutant or
G12C mutant labelled fully with either compound 8 or 12) at about 10 μM concentration
was incubated with 200 μM mant-dGDP (Jena Biosciences) in the presence of 2.5 M EDTA.
After 1 h at room temperature, MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mM was added. The
protein was then run through a NAP-5 column to remove free nucleotide. The concentration
of the obtained protein was determined by Bradford assay and the protein was then used in
the described plate-based assay.

For the assay, 10 μl of the prepared protein in reaction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150
mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM MgCl2) was added to a well of a low volume black
bottom plate (Corning, 3676). The fluorescence intensity was measured on a spectramax M5
plate reader (Molecular Devices, 360 nm excitation, 440 nm emission) to provide a value
used in later normalization. Then, 5 μl of an EDTA solution with the indicated nucleotide
(GDP or GTP) was added to each well and the reaction mix was allowed to equilibrate for 2
h at room temperature. Measurement of the fluorescent intensity at this time provided the
end point. Samples were measured in duplicates for each experiment. In the final mix the
concentrations were the following: protein (1 μM), EDTA (5 mM) and nucleotide (as
indicated, titrated in 2.5-fold dilution series, 15 points). Curves show results from one
representative experiment, the column graph shows the averaged data from three
experiments, with errors representing s.d. For the determination of IC50, a sigmoidal curve
fit was used for each nucleotide (Prism software).

The experiment was carried out similarly as described for the nucleotide affinity assay using
the same plate set-up and plate reader. In brief, the respective full-length proteins were
loaded with mant-dGDP (see above). For the assay, 10 μl of the prepared protein (1 μM
final) in reaction buffer was added to the wells. To start the reaction, 5 μl of SOS (1 μM
final), EDTA (5 mM final), or buffer was added and the fluorescence monitored for 5 h at
90-s intervals. Half-lives were determined using Prism software (single-exponential decay
fit).
Cell culture
H23, H358, H1299, H1437, H1792, Calu-1 and A549 (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM
with 10% FBS.
Viability assays

HHMI Author Manuscript

Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 2,000 cells per well in 90 μl DMEM with 10% FBS
and allowed to attach for 24 h. Cells were treated by the addition of 10 μl 100 μM compound
(or half-log dilutions thereof) or vehicle (0.1% DMSO final). After 72 h, media was
exchanged and plates were analysed using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
(Promega).
Apoptosis assays
The Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences) was used to detect
apoptotic cells. Cell lines were plated in 6-well plates at ~50% confluence, and after 24 h
cells were treated with the given compound for 48 h. Subsequently, cells were washed with
PBS, trypsinized and resuspended in 150 μl annexin-V binding buffer. Finally, cells were
stained with annexin-V-FITC and propidium iodide and incubated in the dark before
analysis on a FACS LSRII Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Data were collected using
FACSDiva analysis software (Beckman Coulter). At least 10,000 cells were measured per
individual sample. Results are given as Δannexin-V/propidium-iodide unstained cells of
untreated (DMSO) versus treated samples.

siRNA knockdown

HHMI Author Manuscript

Cells were plated either in 96-well plates or 6-well plates 24 h before transfection with short
interfering RNA (siRNA). The siRNA constructs were diluted (10–20 nM) in RNAiMaxLipofectamine (Life Technologies) containing OPTI-MEM media, and after 20 min of
incubation the mixture was added drop-wise to the cells. After 72 h of incubation, cells were
either lysed for immunoblotting experiments (K-Ras antibody, Sigma 3B10-2F2; actin
antibody, Cell Signaling Technology 4970) or subjected to CellTiterGlo assays (Promega)
for proliferation analysis. The KRAS siRNA guide and passenger strand sequences used
were as follows: guide, 5′-ACUGUACUCCUCUUGACCUGCU-3′; passenger, 5′CAGGUCAAGAGGAGUACAGUUA-3′.
Immunoprecipitation

HHMI Author Manuscript

Cells were treated at given conditions in 10-cm plates and lysed in phosphatase and protease
inhibitor containing lysis buffer. Lysates were mixed with 4 μl primary Ras antibody
(Abcam, EPR3255), and incubated with rocking overnight at 4 °C. Protein G agarose beads
were added to the mixture, and after 3 h beads were pelleted, washed with lysis buffer, and
after resuspension in loading buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min were analysed by SDS–
PAGE followed by immunoblot. B-Raf (Santa Cruz, F-7) and C-Raf (Cell Signaling
Technology, 9422) antibodies were used to detect the individual proteins.

a, Compound 6 (cyan) is attached to Cys 12 of K-Ras(G12C) and extends into an allosteric
binding pocket beneath switch-II (blue), the S-IIP. The binding pocket in K-Ras (surface
representation of the protein shown) fits 6 tightly and includes hydrophobic sub-pockets
(dashed lines). An extension of the pocket is occupied by water molecules (red spheres) and
might provide space for modified compound analogues. b–d, X-ray crystallographic studies
of K-Ras(G12C) bound to several additional electrophilic analogues (14, 15 and 16,
respectively) reveal a similar overall binding mode. All compounds follow a similar
trajectory from Cys 12 into S-IIP but show some variability in the region of the piperidine/
piperazine. The respective switch-I regions of the protein can be disordered. e, Overlay of
the two different crystal forms of K-Ras(G12C) bound to 9 (space group C2 (grey) and
P212121 (cyan)) is shown. The ligand orientation and conformation shows minimal changes,
whereas switch-II of the protein appears disordered in the C2 form and atypical in the
P212121 form. f, An overlay for several compounds including the disulphide 6 is shown (16green, 6-yellow, 7-orange, 9-cyan). Key hydrophobic residues are labelled and hydrophobic
interaction between the compounds and the (p-) or (o-) sub-pockets are indicated by dashed

switch-I (red) and switch-II (blue) in place. The inactive GDP-bound structure of HRas(G12C) reveals the absence of these key interactions and increased distances between
these residues and the position of the γ-phosphate (positions from GMPPNP structure

‘spring-loaded’ Ras-GTP back to the GDP state, with opening of switch-II. Compound
binding moves switch-II even further away and interferes with GTP binding itself.
