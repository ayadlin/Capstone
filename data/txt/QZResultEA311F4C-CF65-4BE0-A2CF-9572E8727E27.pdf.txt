BACKGROUND: Little is known about the factors that predict for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) recurrence in patients treated
with adjuvant imatinib. METHODS: Risk factors for GIST recurrence were identified, and 2 risk stratification scores were developed
using the database of the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group (SSG) XVIII trial, where 358 patients with high-risk GIST with no overt metastases were randomly assigned to adjuvant imatinib 400 mg/day either for 12 or 36 months after surgery. The findings were validated
in the imatinib arm of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z9001 trial, where 359 patients with GIST were randomized
to receive imatinib and 354 were to receive placebo for 12 months. RESULTS: Five factors (high tumor mitotic count, nongastric location, large size, rupture, and adjuvant imatinib for 12 months) were independently associated with unfavorable recurrence-free survival
(RFS) in a multivariable analysis in the SSGXVIII cohort. A risk score based on these 5 factors had a concordance index with GIST recurrence of 78.9%. When a simpler score consisting of the 2 strongest predictive factors (mitotic count and tumor site) was devised,
the groups with the lowest, intermediate high, and the highest risk had 5-year RFS of 76.7%, 47.5%, and 8.4%, respectively. Both
scores were strongly associated with RFS in the validation cohort (P <.001 for each comparison). CONCLUSIONS: The scores generated were effective in stratifying the risk of GIST recurrence in patient populations treated with adjuvant imatinib. Patients with nonC 2014 The Authors.

INTRODUCTION
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common sarcoma of the gastrointestinal tract.1,2 Activating mutations in
KIT or PDGFRA oncogenes are considered the key molecular drivers of GIST pathogenesis.1 KIT mutations, found in 70%
to 80% of GISTs, occur frequently in gene exon 11 and sometimes in exon 9, 13, or 17.1 PDGFRA mutation is present in
approximately one-third of the GISTs that lack KIT mutation.3,4 GISTs that lack KIT and PDGFRA mutation are referred
to as wild-type GISTs, although these tumors may harbor mutations in SDH (succinate dehydrogenase), B-RAF, or K-RAS.1

Original Article

Most patients with GIST are cured by surgery
alone,2 but administration of adjuvant imatinib at least
for 3 years is now recommended when the risk of recurrence is considered significant.5,6 This recommendation is
based on 3 randomized studies, the American College of
Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) trial Z9001 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00041197),7 the European
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC)
sponsored
randomized
trial
62024
(NCT00103168),8 and the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group
(SSG) XVIII/Arbeitsgemeinschaft Internistische Onkologie
(AIO) trial (NCT00116935).9 In these studies, imatinib
improved recurrence-free survival (RFS) as compared with
placebo7 or observation,8 and the SSGXVIII/AIO study
found 3 years of adjuvant imatinib to improve RFS and
overall survival as compared with 1 year of imatinib in a
patient population with KIT-positive high-risk GIST.9
Many studies have addressed the risk of GIST recurrence after surgery only,10,11 but most high-risk patients
are now treated with surgery and adjuvant imatinib, and
little data are available about the risk factors for GIST recurrence in this setting. Yet, such data are valuable for
planning of patient follow-up and for counseling. We
investigated the risk factors for GIST recurrence within
the context of 2 of the 3 large randomized adjuvant trials
performed (SSGXVIII/AIO and Z9001), and devised
scores for estimation of the risk of recurrence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

and the pelvis were performed at 6-month intervals during
adjuvant imatinib treatment and after its completion in
each group. Blood cell counts and chemistries were monitored, and physical examination was performed 4 weeks
after study entry, every 3 months until 3 years on study,
and subsequently every 6 months.9 Histological diagnosis
of GIST and patient risk stratification were done at the
participating institutes. Tumor histology was reviewed
centrally after study entry by 2 pathologists, who also independently repeated tumor mitotic counting. KIT and
PDGFRA were centrally screened for presence of mutations after study entry.9
The ACOSOG Z9001 Trial

The results obtained were validated in the patient population that received imatinib in the ACOSOG Z9001 trial.7
In Z9001, 713 patients with KIT-positive GIST  3 cm
in diameter removed macroscopically completely at surgery were randomly assigned to receive either imatinib
400 mg/day (359 patients) or placebo (354 patients) for
12 months from 230 institutions in the United States and
Canada between July 2002 and April 2007. The patients
were free of tumor at study entry by imaging that included
chest radiograph (or CT) and CT or MRI of the abdomen
and pelvis. CT scan or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis
was performed at 3-month intervals for the first 2 years
and every 6 months for the next 3 years. The primary endpoint was RFS. The study was approved by the institutional review board of each institution, and all patients
provided written informed consent.

The SSGXVIII/AIO Trial

Patients who had undergone macroscopically complete
surgery for KIT-immunopositive GIST and who had a
high estimated risk for recurrence according to the modified National Institutes of Health (NIH) consensus criteria were eligible to the SSGXVIII/AIO trial.9,12 The
exclusion criteria included metastatic or recurrent GIST,
and neoadjuvant treatment for GIST.9 The study was
approved by the national or institutional review committees, and the patients provided written informed consent.
The patients were randomly allocated to receive adjuvant imatinib 400 mg daily either for 12 or 36 months
between February 2004 and September 2008. The primary endpoint was RFS, considered as the time period
from the date of randomization to the date of first detection of recurrence or death, whichever occurred first. The
staging examinations at study entry included contrastenhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and the pelvis, and
chest CT or radiograph. CT (or MRI) of the abdomen

Statistical Methods

The Intention-To-Treat population of the SSGXVIII/
AIO study consisted of 397 patients who signed informed
consent. The current study was carried out in the Efficacy
Population, which was formed when 3 patients who did
not provide informed consent were excluded, as well as 15
patients who did not have GIST at central pathology
review, and 24 patients who had 1 or more metastases
removed in addition to the primary tumor at surgery. Of
the 358 patients in the Efficacy Population, 181 received
adjuvant imatinib for 12 months and 177 received it for
36 months. During a median follow-up time of 54
months, 72 and 42 patients had GIST recurrence in the
12-month and the 36-month groups, respectively.9
The factors defining the subgroups examined were
predefined in the Statistical Analysis Plan of the
SSGXVIII/AIO study,9 except for the subgroups based on
the body mass index and the time from the date of surgery
to the date of randomization, which were included as

exploratory variables of potential interest. Frequency
tables were analyzed using the chi-square test. Continuous
distributions between groups were compared using Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test or the Mann-Whitney test, and
mitotic counts determined locally and centrally with the
Spearman rank correlation coefficient (R).
Survival between groups was compared using the
Kaplan-Meier life-table method and unstratified Cox proportional hazards model (hazard ratios [HR] and P values). Patients who were alive without recurrence were
censored on the date of last follow-up. Independence of
prognostic factors was assessed using a stepwise Cox proportional hazards model. The Cox model was used to test
the interactions between the duration of treatment and
potential predictive factors by including each factor, one
at a time, to the model together with treatment duration
and the interaction term.
The concordance index for the model discriminative
accuracy was calculated according to Harrell et al.13 Subpopulation treatment effect pattern plot (STEPP) analyses
were applied using the sliding window approach to investigate the correlation between RFS and the risk score.14
Sigmoidal nonlinear regression models were fitted to the
STEPP curves to further illustrate the link between the
RFS and the risk score. P values are 2-sided and not
adjusted for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.2 for Windows (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The 12 factors examined were balanced between the allocation groups (Table 1). The median tumor size was 10.0

cm, and did not differ between gastric and nongastric
GISTs (9.5 cm and 10.0 cm, respectively; P 5 .716). The
number of mitoses per 50 high-power fields of the microscope (HPFs) as determined locally or centrally showed
strong correlation (R 5 0.42, P < .001), but the median
number was higher at local tumor histopathological
assessment as compared with central review (9; interquartile range [IQR] of 5-20; versus 6, IQR of 2-17; respectively, P < .001). There was no difference in the mitotic
counts between gastric and nongastric GISTs assessed either locally or centrally (P > .500 for each comparison).
Univariable Survival Analyses

A low tumor mitotic count, gastric location, and patient
allocation to the 3-year adjuvant imatinib arm were
strongly associated with favorable RFS in univariable survival analyses (each P < .001; Fig. 1; Table 2). Tumor
rupture, KIT exon 9 mutation, and a large body mass
index were also associated with unfavorable RFS, whereas
tumor PDGFRA mutation D842V was associated with
favorable RFS (Table 2).
Multivariable Survival Analyses

In a stepwise Cox multivariable analysis a low tumor mitotic count (with central assessment), location in the
stomach, and adjuvant imatinib for 36 months were the
most important independent factors associated with
favorable RFS (P < .001 for each factor). Small tumor size
and absence of rupture (either prior to or at surgery) were
also independently associated with favorable RFS
(P 5 .004 and .010, respectively). Tumor mutation category, age at randomization, and time from surgery to randomization tended to be associated with RFS (P 5 .054,
.061, and .087, respectively), whereas sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, the
body mass index, completeness of surgery (R0 versus R1),
country, or the study site did not have independent prognostic value. No interaction was found between any of the
studied factors and the duration of treatment.
Recurrence Risk Score Consisting of 5
Independent Factors

A risk score for GIST recurrence was next generated using
the regression coefficients of the 5 independent factors
identified in the Cox multivariable analysis as follows:
Recurrence risk score 5 0.05316 3 tumor mitotic
count per 50 HPFs 1 0.00000 (if gastric GIST) 1
1.17607 (if nongastric GIST) 1 0.00000 (adjuvant imatinib for 3 years) 1 0.89619 (adjuvant imatinib for 1
year) 1 0.00000 (if no tumor rupture) 1 0.68533 (if
tumor rupture) 1 0.04460 3 tumor size (cm).
2328

The few cases with a very high mitotic count (> 40
per 50 HPFs) were entered as 40 per 50 HPFs when
designing the score. The score was strongly associated
with the risk of GIST recurrence (shown for score tertiles
in Fig. 2A). When the concordance index was computed,
the discriminative accuracy of the score was 78.9%. The
score predicted RFS well when stratified by the duration
of adjuvant imatinib administered (Fig. 2B). Of note, a
substantial proportion of the patients who had the score
within the highest tertile ( 2.61) had GIST recurrence
within the first 3 years from randomization despite adjuvant imatinib. The score was strongly associated with RFS
in the Z9001 validation cohort (P < .001, Fig. 2C).
Plots estimating the risk of GIST recurrence at 3 or
5 years after initiation of adjuvant imatinib were generated with a STEPP curve showing the RFS as a function
of the risk score and by fitting a nonlinear model to the
STEPP curve (Fig. 3). For example, for a patient with
nonruptured gastric GIST 10 cm in diameter and with 10
mitoses per 50 HPFs who received adjuvant imatinib for
3 years, the risk score is 0.98 (0.05316 3 10 [10
mitoses] 1 0.00000 [gastric GIST] 1 0.00000 [imatinib
for 3 years] 1 0.00000 [no rupture] 1 0.044460 3 10
[size 10 cm]) corresponding to 96% probability of surviving for 5 years free from GIST recurrence, whereas for an
otherwise similar tumor that is nongastric, the score is
2.15 and the 5-year RFS probability is 63%.

Recurrence Score Consisting of Tumor Mitotic
Count and Site

To generate a predictive score that does not require computations for risk estimation and does not include the
planned duration of adjuvant imatinib as a parameter, we
selected the 2 factors that were most strongly associated
with RFS in the multivariable analysis for risk estimation
(tumor mitotic count assessed centrally and tumor site).
In this categorized 2-factor scheme, gastric GISTs with 10 mitoses and nongastric GISTs with  5 mitoses per
50 HPFs formed the lowest recurrence risk group, which
consisted of 197 (57.9%) of the 340 tumors with data
available on both factors. The group with intermediate
high recurrence risk group consisted of gastric GISTs with
11 to 50 mitoses and of nongastric GISTs with 6 to 20
mitoses (n 5 104 [30.6%]), and the highest risk group of
gastric GISTs with > 50 mitoses and of nongastric GISTs
with > 20 mitoses (n 5 39 [11.5%]). These groups with
the lowest, intermediate high, or the highest risk of
recurrence were associated with 5-year RFS of 76.7%
(95% confidence interval [CI] 5 67.7%-83.5%), 47.5%

follow-up, and most of such patients assigned to 3 years of
adjuvant imatinib had recurrence while on imatinib (Fig.
4). The results remained largely similar when the locally
assessed mitotic counts were used in place of the central
counts, and when those patients who discontinued imatinib for adverse effects (n 5 40) or patient wish (n 5 10)
were excluded from the analysis. This 2-factor risk score
was strongly associated with RFS in the validation series
(P < .001).

DISCUSSION
We generated 2 risk estimation scores for patients with
GIST who were treated with adjuvant imatinib, one based
on the 5 independent factors identified in a multivariable
model and another simpler scheme based on tumor mitotic count and site only. The latter scheme is independent of the planned duration of adjuvant imatinib to be
administered. To our knowledge, these are the first predictive schemes developed for this patient population,

and may help in patient counseling, planning of followup, and selection of treatments.
GIST patients with the highest risk scores had a very
high risk of GIST recurrence despite adjuvant imatinib,
and recurrences were frequent both when the patients
were on adjuvant imatinib and after its completion. This
observation highlights a need for careful monitoring of
patients with GIST with a high mitotic count and nongastric site of origin, and perhaps also those with KIT exon 9
mutation. Frequent CT or MRI examinations of the abdomen during adjuvant therapy and the follow-up thereafter are likely beneficial for this subset of patients, and,
obviously, more effective adjuvant therapy needs to be
developed.
The most important single factors for recurrence
were high tumor mitotic count, nongastric site of origin,
and short duration of adjuvant imatinib treatment, but
large tumor size and tumor rupture were also independently associated with RFS. Of note, the GIST mutation
status and tumor rupture were not as strongly linked with
unfavorable outcome as the mitotic count and site. Little
data are available from other series about the factors associated with GIST recurrence during and after adjuvant
imatinib, but in 1 nonrandomized series consisting of 106
patients who were treated with adjuvant imatinib at 400
mg daily for 12 months, GIST size, small bowel site, KIT
exon 9 mutation, high mitotic rate, and older age were
associated with poor RFS in a multivariable analysis.15
The reliability of mitotic counting is controversial.
Potential limitations include different criteria for mitosis
identification between pathologists, variance in the size of
the microscope field-of-view at counting, and the influence of tissue fixation on the count.16,17 Several other
methods have been evaluated for assessing GIST cell proliferation rate, such as immunostaining for the Ki-67 antigen18 or the mitotic checkpoint proteins,19 but none of
these has replaced mitotic counting. Although the median
mitotic count differed between the local and central pathologists, the local and central counts correlated strongly,
and both were associated with RFS. Despite its limited
reproducibility, the mitotic count may be the most important single prognostic factor in GIST.2
The study has some limitations. We were unable to
study overall survival as the endpoint due to the small
number of deaths encountered, and some of the subgroups were relatively small in size. Because high-risk
GIST was a study entry criterion in the SSGXVIII/AIO
trial, the risk factors related to intermediate-risk GIST
cannot be adequately addressed in this series, but the
prognostic scores generated were strongly predictive also

in the Z9001 trial series that also includes patients with
lower risk GIST.7
We conclude that the scores generated were effective
in stratifying of the risk of GIST recurrence in patient
populations treated with adjuvant imatinib. GISTs with
high mitotic count arising at nongastric sites recur frequently despite adjuvant imatinib, and some of such
tumors recur when the patient is on imatinib suggesting
that more efficient treatments need to be pursued. Such
adjuvant strategies might include a higher than the standard 400 mg dose of imatinib, novel agents, or agents
administered in combinations or in a sequence. Many
GISTs recur soon after discontinuation of adjuvant imatinib, suggesting that treatment durations exceeding 3 years
warrant evaluation.
