response to cell injury involves key processes such as cell cycle
arrest, DNA repair, replicative senescence, and apoptosis whenever
damage overwhelms repair. Furthermore, p53 continuously protects cells from endogenous, highly mutagenic reactive oxygen
species (ROS), including free radicals, produced by the cell itself as
respiration products and second messengers during cell signaling.
Although cytoplasmic and mitochondrial functions have been
described for p53 (1, 2), its most relevant property seems to be
its transcriptional activity over target genes that mediate tumorsuppressive functions. A good example of this is the recently
reported physiologic antioxidant activity of p53, which is
dependent on its DNA-binding domain (3). p53 response to
elevated intracellular ROS concentration involves two waves of
transcription induction. The first wave starts when cells endure
low oxidant concentrations, in which case p53 induces transcription of genes with antioxidant and cell cycle regulatory properties,
such as sestrins and p21, to favor the restoration of physiologic
intracellular ROS levels (3, 4). When cells endure long-lasting
and/or high concentrations of oxidant, p53 will induce a second
wave of transcription of proapoptotic genes, such as those
encoding Puma and Bax, to promote cell death (3, 5, 6).
Interestingly, none of the above-mentioned p53 targets induced
during the oxidative stress response is capable of fully restoring
physiologic ROS levels in the absence of p53, suggesting that a
yet unknown p53 target might be responsible for sensing and/or
eliminating ROS surplus.
Tumor protein 53–induced nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1; also
known as TEAP, SIP, and p53DINP1) is a p53 target gene that
encodes the TP53INP1 protein (7–9). Two isoforms of this protein
exist, TP53INP1a and TP53INP1h (18 and 27 kDa, respectively),
resulting from alternative splicing of the transcript and showing no
known functional domain apart from a PEST motif characteristic of
short half-life proteins (8, 9). TP53INP1 may act on a p53-positive
feedback through its interaction with protein kinases HIPK2 and
protein kinase Cy (PKCy; refs. 10, 11). These protein kinases
enhance p53 protein stability and transcriptional activity through
phosphorylation of p53 Ser46 (10–12). TP53INP1 expression is
induced by different cell stress agents (adriamycin, cisplatin,
ethanol, and heat shock) and, most remarkably, by oxidants such
as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or conditions promoting their
formation, such as exposure to UV light or g-rays (8, 9). In turn,
TP53INP1 induces the transcriptional activation of p53 target
promoters, such as those of CDKN1A and Bax genes, when
expressed ectopically in cell lines (10). Furthermore, consistent
with genotoxic stress-induced TP53INP1 transcriptional regulation
by p53, p73, and E2F1 (which are transcription factors implicated
in cell cycle control and tumor suppression), TP53INP1 overexpression provokes a G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro,

Abstract
p53 exerts its tumor suppressor function mainly through
transcriptional induction of target genes involved in several
processes, including cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, and
regulation of cell redox status. p53 antioxidant function is
dependent on its transcriptional activity and proceeds by
sequential induction of antioxidant and proapoptotic targets.
However, none of the thus far renowned p53 targets have
proved able to abolish on their own the intracellular reactive
oxygen species (ROS) accumulation caused by p53 deficiency,
therefore pointing to the existence of other prominent and
yet unknown p53 antioxidant targets. Here, we show that
TP53INP1 represents such a target. Indeed, TP53INP1 transcript induction on oxidative stress is strictly dependent on
p53. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and splenocytes
derived from TP53INP1-deficient (inp1 / ) mice accumulate
intracellular ROS, whereas overexpression of TP53INP1
in p53-deficient MEFs rescues ROS levels to those of
p53-proficient cells, indicating that TP53INP1 antioxidant
function is p53 independent. Furthermore, accumulation of
ROS in inp1 / cells on oxidant challenge is associated with
decreased expression of p53 targets p21/Cdkn1a, Sesn2, TAp73,
Puma, and Bax. Mutation of p53 Ser58 (equivalent to human
p53 Ser46) abrogates transcription of these genes, indicating
that TP53INP1-mediated p53 Ser58 phosphorylation is implicated in this process. In addition, TP53INP1 deficiency results
in an antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine)-sensitive acceleration of
cell proliferation. Finally, TP53INP1 deficiency increases
oxidative stress–related lymphoma incidence and decreases
survival of p53+/ mice. In conclusion, our data show that
TP53INP1 is a major actor of p53-driven oxidative stress
response that possesses both a p53-independent intracellular
ROS regulatory function and a p53-dependent transcription
regulatory function. [Cancer Res 2009;69(1):219–26]

suggesting a tumor suppressor activity (10, 13, 14). We recently
showed that, compared with wild-type (wt), mice deficient for
TP53INP1 present increased susceptibility to colon tumor development in a chronic inflammation setting and a greater production
of ROS in inflamed colon (15). Moreover, the low blood ascorbate
concentration observed in deficient mice indicates a chronic and
systemic oxidative stress, suggesting an antioxidant function for
TP53INP1. In this work, we address the question of the implication
of TP53INP1 in the p53-dependent oxidative stress response and
intracellular ROS regulation. This is achieved by the analysis of
primary cells derived from mice deficient for TP53INP1 and p53
and by the generation and analysis of mice and cells that are
deficient for both of these stress proteins.

Results
TP53INP1 induction on oxidative stress is p53 dependent.
To establish p53 dependence of TP53INP1 expression on oxidative
stress, we derived fibroblasts (MEFs) from wt and p53-deficient
(p53 / ) embryos, cultured them for 1 hour with or without
H2O2, and allowed cells to recover for 12 hours. Then, we assessed
TP53INP1 transcription levels by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Figure 1 shows the resulting expression data
that confirm our previous observations showing strong TP53INP1
induction (>4-fold) in H2O2-treated wt cells (8). In contrast,
TP53INP1 expression was severely compromised in p53 / cells
in the absence of stress (70% reduction) and on H2O2 challenge.
These data show that induction of TP53INP1 on oxidative stress
is totally dependent on p53, although a basal p53-independent
TP53INP1 expression exists in unstressed and H2O2-treated MEFs.
TP53INP1 deficiency induces intracellular accumulation of
ROS. To determine whether TP53INP1 possesses an antioxidant
function, we cultured wt, TP53INP1-deficient (inp1 / ), p53 / ,
and TP53INP1/p53 (DKO) MEFs with or without H2O2 for 1 hour
and allowed cells to recover for 3 or 10 hours. Then, we assessed
intracellular ROS content by flow cytometry using the DCF probe
and determined the percentage of ROS-containing cells (RCC)
within each population. In mock conditions, only inp1 / cells
showed a greater percentage of RCC than wt at any time point
(Fig. 2A). H2O2 challenge increased the fraction of RCC in all
genotypes tested, the highest increase being observed after 3 hours.
inp1 / cells showed more RCC than wt (2- and 1.7-fold at 3 and
10 hours, respectively) on H2O2 challenge. We found more RCC
among p53 / cells compared with wt after H2O2 challenge,
consistent with previous reports (3). Double deficiency for
TP53INP1 and p53 resulted in RCC increase 3 and 10 hours after
oxidative stress compared with wt and p53 / cells, with only a
slight increase 3 hours after stress when compared with inp1 /
cells. Strikingly, there were more inp1 / than p53 / RCC with or
without H2O2 treatment (3- and 1.5-fold, respectively), suggesting

Materials and Methods
Animals. TP53INP1-deficient (inp1 / ) mice were described elsewhere
(15). TP53INP1- and p53-deficient [double knockout (DKO)] mice were
obtained by inbreeding inp1 / and p53 / mice (16). All mice were kept
within the animal facilities and according to the policies of the Laboratoire
d’Exploration Fonctionnelle de Luminy (Marseille, France).
Cells. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from 14.5-d postcoitum wt, inp1 / , p53 / , and DKO embryos were prepared following
a standard protocol (17). All experiments were performed using earlypassage MEFs of at least two independent preparations per genotype.
TP53INP1a-inducible MiaPaCa2 cell line was described elsewhere (18). Cells
were cultured in DMEM and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen)
at 37jC, 5% CO2. Viral transduction of MEFs and transfection of MiaPaCa2
cells are described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Oxidative stress and intracellular ROS detection. MEFs were platted
in triplicate in 35-mm culture dishes (BD Biosciences) and treated with
50 Amol/L H2O2 in DMEM without FBS at 37jC. After 1 h, medium was
replaced by DMEM and 10% FBS with or without 5,000 units/mL catalase
(Sigma), and cells were allowed to recover for the times indicated. For
intracellular ROS detection, cells were further cultured for 15 min at 37jC
in DMEM, 10% FBS, and 5 Amol/L dichlorofluorescein (DCF) diacetate
(Sigma), which is oxidized in the presence of ROS into green fluorescent
DCF, whose fluorescence was assessed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur
cytometer (BD Biosciences). ROS accumulation rate is expressed as the fold
changes of DCF-positive cells between mock- and H2O2-treated MEFs.
Electron spin resonance measurements. Assessment of extracellular
release of free radicals from H2O2-pretreated MEFs was performed using
electron spin resonance (ESR) technology and the spin trap 5-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DEPMPO). For more details,
see Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Proliferation assays. One hundred thousand MEFs of each genotype
were plated in triplicate in 35-mm dishes and cultured for up to 7 d in
conventional medium with or without 10 mmol/L N-acetylcysteine (NAC;
Sigma). Medium was renewed every 3 d. Cells were counted daily by trypan
blue exclusion to establish growth curves. The number of population
doublings (PD) was calculated using the formula PD = ln(Nf/Ni)/ln2, where
Nf and Ni are final and initial cell numbers, respectively.
RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis.
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and cDNAs were
prepared using ImProm-II kit (Promega) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed in a LightCycler (Roche)
using the SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio). For details of amplification,
see Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Histologic analysis. p53 / , p53+/ , and TP53INP1/p53 double-deficient
mice were sacrificed when showing illness and autopsied. Tissues/tumors
were collected, formalin fixed, and paraffin embedded. Sections were
stained with H&E (Vector Laboratories) and mounted in Eukitt solution
(Vector Laboratories) before diagnosis.
Statistics. All statistical analyses were performed using the StatView
5.0 software (SAS Institute, Inc.). Data on MEFs were analyzed using the
nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test on triplicate measures. Mice survival

that TP53INP1 action over ROS could be, at least in part,
independent of p53. To test this hypothesis, we performed
retroviral transduction on E1A/rasV12-transformed p53 / MEFs
to introduce TP53INP1a or TP53INP1h alone or along with p53
and determined the ROS accumulation rate in these cells 3 hours
after H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2B). As expected, restoration of p53
expression in p53 / cells led to a drop of ROS accumulation on
oxidant challenge compared with p53 / cells transduced with
empty vectors. Transduction of either TP53INP1a or TP53INP1h
was able to drop ROS accumulation in p53 / cells even below
levels reached by p53 restoration alone, and cotransduction of p53
and TP53INP1 isoforms did not significantly improve TP53INP1
antioxidant effect. Therefore, once TP53INP1 is induced on
oxidative stress, it seems to play its antioxidant function
independently of p53.
We determined the physiologic relevance of TP53INP1 antioxidant function by measuring ROS content in splenocytes,
thymocytes, and RBCs from wt and inp1 / mice (Fig. 2C). We
observed a significant increase of intracellular ROS content in
splenocytes but not in thymocytes or RBC from inp1 / mice
compared with wt. Splenocytes of both the myeloid and lymphoid
compartments were affected to the same extent in inp1 /
mice (Fig. 2D). Altogether, these data show that TP53INP1 is a
negative regulator of intracellular ROS content both under
physiologic conditions in splenocytes and under oxidative stress
in MEFs.

TP53INP1 deficiency affects the regulation of H2O2 content
in MEFs. DCF is a general oxidant indicator rather than a specific
marker for H2O2 (19). We determined TP53INP1 implication on
intracellular H2O2 regulation by incubating H2O2-pretreated wt
and inp1 / MEFs with catalase (an H2O2 scavenger) before RCC
assessment using DCF. Catalase treatment after H2O2 stress
abolished RCC differences between inp1 / and wt MEFs
(Fig. 3A), indicating that TP53INP1 deficiency provokes H2O2
accumulation. Evidence that TP53INP1 deficiency triggers an
abnormal extracellular release of H2O2-derived free radicals after
H2O2 challenge was provided with spin trapping experiments
in which the spin trap DEPMPO was added to H2O2-pretreated
MEFs during recovery. Regardless of the genotype, no ESR signal
was detected in medium samples collected up to 30 minutes after
H2O2 removal (Fig. 3B, trace a). From 30 minutes, addition of
DEPMPO led to spin adducts formation, typical spectra of which
are shown in Fig. 3B (traces b and d for inp1 / and wt cells,
respectively). Computer simulation of the signals afforded hyperfine coupling constants consistent with mixtures of DEPMPO/ OH
as a superimposition of f64% trans (a N = 14.06 G, a Hh = 12.73 G,
a P = 47.23 G) and 36% cis (a N = 14.06 G, a Hh = 14.06 G, a P = 47.29 G)
diastereoisomers (20), and two DEPMPO/alkyl adducts [a N = 14.55
(14.34) G, a Hh = 21.47 (19.34) G, a P = 46.76 (47.14) G] accounting for
25% to 35% of the total signal (see Fig. 3B, traces c and e). ESR
signal was completely abolished when either catalase (Fig. 3B,
trace f ) or the metal ion chelator deferoxamine (Fig. 3B, trace g )

significantly higher number of doublings than wt cells after NAC
treatment, suggesting that TP53INP1 may have a redox-independent role in cell cycle regulation. Moreover, TP53INP1 restoration
reinstated wt-like proliferation rates in inp1 / but not in p53 /
E1A/rasV12-transformed MEFs (Supplementary Fig. S1), whereas
DKO proliferation was only partially reestablished. In conclusion,
these data show that TP53INP1 possesses a physiologic growthinhibitory function related to its antioxidant properties.
TP53INP1 deficiency affects p53-dependent transcription on
oxidative stress. Because expression of p53 target genes could be
affected by TP53INP1 deficiency, we searched for modifications of
the expression of well-known oxidative stress–induced p53 targets
p21 (Cdkn1a), sestrin 2 (Sesn2), Puma, and Bax in inp1 / , p53 / ,
and DKO MEFs compared with wt, in mock- and H2O2-treated
cells, using qRT-PCR. Although none of the expressions of these
genes was modified in unstressed cells, we observed that their
transcripts were drastically reduced in inp1 / , p53 / , and DKO
cells compared with wt after H2O2 challenge (Fig. 5A). Similarly,
oxidative stress–induced expression of p53 homologue TAp73 was
abolished in the absence of TP53INP1 (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Positive action of TP53INP1 on transcription on H2O2 challenge is

was added to the medium from the beginning of the experiment.
Figure 3C displays the time course of spin adduct formation
in both genotypes, with a burst at 75 minutes following H2O2
removal and still detectable levels after 150 minutes. All along this
150-minute period, DEPMPO adducts detected in samples from
wt cells were significantly lower than those from inp1 / cells
(P < 0.001, by two-way ANOVA).
Increased proliferation is related to oxidative stress in
TP53INP1-deficient cells. We determined whether TP53INP1
plays a physiologic role in cell proliferation by comparing growth
rates of wt, inp1 / , p53 / , and DKO MEFs. Early-passage MEFs
were seeded at equal number and counted daily for 7 days. inp1 /
MEFs proliferate more rapidly than wt, although slower than
p53 / , which proliferate slower compared with DKO (Fig. 4A).
Consistently, the number of PDs of each genotype after 7 days
confirmed the differences in growth rates shown by daily counts
(Fig. 4B, left). Importantly, addition of the antioxidant NAC during
proliferation assays resulted in a restoration of inp1 / , p53 / ,
and DKO number of doublings back to that of wt (Fig. 4B, right),
indicating that accelerated growth in deficient cells is related to
oxidative stress. Nevertheless, DKO cells conserved a mild but

Antioxidant Function of TP53INP1

significantly altered by TP53INP1 deficiency (data not shown).
Nevertheless, TP53INP1 deficiency affects p53 heterozygous mice
fate (Fig. 6B). Indeed, whereas >80% of inp1+/+ and inp1+/ mice
with a p53+/ background survived at 15 months, 50% of inp1 /
p53+/ animals had died by the same time (P < 0.001). Moreover,
lymphoma penetrance was increased in inp1 / p53+/ mice
compared with inp1+/ p53+/ and inp1+/+ p53+/ animals (75%,
29%, and 0%, respectively; Fig. 5C). As TP53INP1 deficiency causes
increased oxidative load in vivo, these observations are in accordance with previous data associating lymphoma incidence in p53deficient animals with increased endogenous oxidative stress (3).

Discussion
In this work, we show that TP53INP1 is necessary for controlling
intracellular ROS levels both in the absence of exogenous stress and
after oxidant challenge, that its induction on oxidative stress is
strictly dependent on p53, and that it enhances p53-dependent
transcription on oxidative stress. This is the first report of
TP53INP1 cell-intrinsic antioxidant function, and it sheds light
on our previous observations of chronic oxidative stress in
TP53INP1-deficient mice (15). We previously reported that
inp1 / mice are more sensitive than wt to experimentally induced
colitis and colon carcinogenesis, associated with increased
granulocyte infiltration and colon ROS release. Although in the
case of colon inflammation increased ROS in inp1 / colons could
be attributed to a more aggressive response of ROS secreting
granulocytes and thus to an indirect effect of TP53INP1 on ROS
in vivo, data from primary fibroblasts clearly show that TP53INP1
plays an antioxidant function at the cell level.
Intracellular ROS accumulation observed in inp1 / MEFs can
result from either an increased production or a defective
degradation of ROS. Although our experiments do not discriminate
between these processes, we can take out some clues about
TP53INP1 mechanism of action on regulation of cell ROS content.
Abrogation by catalase of differences in RCCs between wt and
inp1 / cells indicates that H2O2 aberrantly accumulates in
inp1 / cells after oxidant challenge. Because TP53INP1 protein
sequence does not suggest a potential catalytic activity, it is
unlikely that it possesses an intrinsic capacity to produce or
detoxify H2O2. Thus, it is possible that TP53INP1 enhances the
activity of ROS regulatory enzymes. Indeed, such cofactor activity
has already been described for TP53INP1 in the case of p53
regulation, in which TP53INP1 binds HIPK2 and PKCy kinases
and p53 itself to favor p53 phosphorylation (10, 11).
Two ways of H2O2 degradation can be foreseen in our
experimental conditions that can be discriminated by the outcome
of ESR. The first way is provided by the endogenous antioxidant
defenses (i.e., catalase, glutathione peroxidases, and peroxiredoxins) that decompose H2O2 into water and molecular oxygen.
Whenever this pathway is defective, excess H2O2 may engage into
the Fenton reaction in the presence of metals, yielding HO that
will be trapped by DEPMPO to form ESR-detectable DEPMPO/ OH
adducts. Here, we show that inp1 / cells release more DEPMPO
trappable HO than wt after oxidant challenge (Fig. 3B and C) and
that spin adduct formation is inhibited by the chelator deferoxamine (Fig. 3B, trace g ). Therefore, our data suggest that inp1 /
MEFs can either produce more de novo H2O2 or release greater
amounts of H2O2 and metal catalysts than wt, or both, which
ultimately lead to the observed extracellular DEPMPO/ OH
buildup. Two mechanisms unrelated to direct trapping of HO

not generalized to all p53 targets because transcription of cyclin G1
and Mdm2 was not affected in inp1 / cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Furthermore, we assessed the expression of the CD44
gene whose expression is repressed by p53 (21) and noticed that
CD44 repression was released in inp1 / , p53 / , and DKO cells in
the absence of stress (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, these cells failed to
up-regulate CD44 expression on oxidative stress. Finally, unstressed
inp1 / splenocytes exhibit higher levels of CD44 expression than
their wt counterparts (Supplementary Fig. S4). In conclusion,
our data show that TP53INP1 deficiency significantly affects p53dependent transcription on oxidant challenge.
p53 Ser58 is essential for TP53INP1-mediated transcription
of oxidative stress–induced p53 targets. Because TP53INP1
favors p53 Ser46 phosphorylation in humans (the homologue of
p53 Ser58 in mice; refs. 10, 22), we determined whether Ser58
phosphorylation is necessary for TP53INP1 action on oxidative
stress–related p53 targets. For this purpose, we introduced
expression vectors encoding either a wt or a Ser58 to Ala mutated
p53 (S58A) into a TP53INP1-inducible MiaPaCa2 cell line that
lacks functional p53 and in which TP53INP1 expression can be
triggered by ponasterone A (18). The absence of TP53INP1
expression in the absence of ponasterone A treatment was
confirmed by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S5). We quantified
p21, Sesn2, Bax, and Puma transcripts in these cells (Fig. 5C)
and observed that, consistent with results in MEFs, TP53INP1
induction enhanced the transcription of these genes in MiaPaCa2
cells transfected with wt p53. In contrast, cells transfected with p53
S58A failed to induce transcription of the same genes independently of TP53INP1 presence. In conclusion, our data show that
p53 Ser58 is crucial for the triggering of p21, Sesn2, Puma, and Bax
transcription and for TP53INP1-dependent enhancement of this
triggering.
TP53INP1 deficiency increases lymphoma incidence and
mortality in p53 heterozygous mice. Finally, we determined the
effect of TP53INP1 deficiency on survival and tumor incidence in
mice deficient for p53. As shown in Fig. 6A, TP53INP1 deficiency
did not affect survival of homozygous p53-deficient mice (i.e.,
f50% of animals died by 5 months regardless of their TP53INP1
status). Tumor incidence and tumor type in p53 / mice were not

we found a reduction of the expression of several p53 target genes
in H2O2-pretreated inp1 / MEFs compared with wt, of which
some are cell cycle regulators (i.e., p21/Cdkn1a), some antioxidants
(Sesn2), and some proapoptotic (i.e., TAp53, Puma, and Bax).
Moreover, we report for the first time to our knowledge the
dependence of the expression of these genes on TP53INP1mediated p53 Ser58 phosphorylation. These results reinforce our
previous report of TP53INP1 ability to enhance p53 transcriptional
activity (10) and indicate that TP53INP1 is the missing piece in
Sablina’s picture of p53 antioxidant function (3). In this new
picture, oxidative stress induces p53 expression, which in turn
triggers expression of TP53INP1 that will then enhance, by a
mechanism yet to be elucidated, the activity of the endogenous
antioxidant machinery (Supplementary Fig. S6). In parallel,
TP53INP1 interaction with HIPK2 and PKCy will lead to p53
Ser58 phosphorylation, thus allowing transcription of p21 and
Sesn2 and subsequent cell cycle arrest and ROS detoxification.
As redox status is restored to physiologic one, TP53INP1
degradation is driven by its PEST domain, and p53 is subsequently
degraded, shutting down the oxidative stress response. In
conditions where oxidative stress persists, TP53INP1 enhances
transcription of Puma and Bax to induce cell death.
Another interesting finding is the implication of TP53INP1 in
repression of CD44 expression in unstressed MEFs and splenocytes,
as it settles the notion of a transcription regulatory function of
TP53INP1 in basal conditions without exogenous stresses as it has

can yield DEPMPO/ OH: (a) metal-catalyzed nucleophilic addition
of water occurring at the double bond of pyrroline N-oxides (20,
23–25) and (b) reduction of the protonated form of DEPMPO/O2
by glutathione peroxidase (20, 23, 24). Because none of these two
unspecific mechanisms can account for inhibitions by catalase
and deferoxamine (Fig. 3B, traces f and g ), a dominant pathway
for DEPMPO/ OH formation in our study is likely to involve
trapping of HO formed by Fenton reactions with H2O2. This
pathway can also explain the concomitant inhibition of secondary
DEPMPO/alkyls, which may result from hydrogen abstraction by
HO from a variety of cell components. In further support, cis:trans
ratios for DEPMPO/ OH seen here are rather in the range of those
reported in vitro with Fenton reagents than of those observed when
enzymatic reductive systems or nucleophilic synthesis is involved
(20, 24). Therefore, the outcome of ESR assays strongly suggests
that TP53INP1 deficiency leads to an improper function of the
endogenous antioxidant machinery, directing H2O2 processing
toward the Fenton reaction.
Is TP53INP1 action on ROS dependent on p53 function?
Although induction of TP53INP1 by oxidative stress is p53
dependent (Fig. 1), overexpression of TP53INP1 is sufficient to
decrease ROS content in p53-deficient cells to levels comparable
with p53-proficient cells (Fig. 2B). Therefore, TP53INP1 proceeds
to its antioxidant function without direct participation of p53.
Nevertheless, TP53INP1 seems to collaborate with p53 in
transcription induction in response to oxidative stress. Indeed,

Antioxidant Function of TP53INP1

antioxidant properties. This is particularly remarkable because
the action of these proteins at the G1 checkpoint has thus far been
attributed exclusively to their transcriptional activity on cell cycle
regulatory genes. In fact, antioxidant and transcriptional activities
of these two proteins may act synergistically on cell cycle because
low concentrations of oxidant are necessary for S-phase progression (26). In this way, TP53INP1 and p53 could control cell cycle
progression by keeping ROS in check and, when necessary, by
inducing G1 checkpoint.
Finally, TP53INP1 deficiency aggravates the outcome of p53
heterozygous mice as it enhances lymphomagenesis (Fig. 6),
presumably promoted by chronic oxidative stress. These results
are consistent with our previous report of TP53INP1 role in colon
tumor suppression through ROS regulation (15). Although
TP53INP1 deficiency alone is not sufficient to induce spontaneous
tumors in mice, it seems to be a suitable ‘‘second hit’’ that allows
tumor promotion after a first transforming event, such as chemical
mutagenesis or loss of a p53 allele. Based on the data presented in
this study, we hypothesize that loss of TP53INP1 favors malignant
transformation by increasing genetic instability through ROS
accumulation and by allowing uncontrolled proliferation of a
damaged cell. Accordingly, we observed the loss of TP53INP1
during the progression of several cancers, particularly during
pancreatic carcinogenesis, and we showed that loss of the
TP53INP1 protein is caused by the action of protumoral miRNA155 (18). Therefore, reestablishment of TP53INP1 expression seems
as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancers
in which oxidative stress is recognized as a promoting factor, such
as those related to chronic inflammation.

related to enhanced proliferation, which could provide a piece of
an explanation for the enhanced proliferation without p21
