ABSTRACT
Aurora kinases play an essential role in mitotic progression and are attractive
targets in cancer therapy. The first generation of benzo[e]pyridoindole exhibited
powerful aurora kinase inhibition but their low solubility limited further development.
Grafting a pyperidine-ethoxy group gives rise to a hydrosoluble inhibitor:
compound C5M.
C5M could efficiently inhibit the proliferation of cells from different origins. C5M
prevented cell cycling, induced a strong mitotic arrest then, cells became polyploid
and finally died. C5M did not impair the spindle checkpoint, the separation of the sister
chromatids and the transfer of aurora B on the mid-zone. C5M prevented histone H3
phosphorylation at mitotic entry and erased AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation in late
mitosis. With this unique profile of inhibition, C5M could be useful for understanding
the role of phospho-Thr172-AMPK in abscission and the relationship between the
chromosomal complex and the energy sensing machinery.
C5M is a multikinase inhibitor with interesting preclinical characteristics: high
hydro-solubility and a good stability in plasma. A single dose prevents the expansion
of multicellular spheroids. C5M can safely be injected to mice and reduces significantly
the development of xenograft. The next step will be to define the protocol of treatment
and the cancer therapeutic field of this new anti-proliferative drug.

[3, 4]. Aurora B is essential for chromosome condensation,
kinetochore functions, spindle checkpoint activation,
and cytokinesis completion [2, 5]. Aurora C is involved
in spermatogenesis and was recently also described in
mammalian oocytes where it efficiently executed meiosis I
and ensured high-quality eggs necessary for sexual
reproduction [6].
Aurora kinases A and B are overexpressed in many
cancers, including primary colon and breast cancers
[7, 8]. In light of these observations, aurora kinases have
emerged as potential druggable targets for anticancer
therapy, and many small molecule inhibitors of aurora

INTRODUCTION
Aurora kinases are a family of serine/threonine
protein kinases that play key roles in mitotic progression
[1, 2]. In humans, three aurora kinases have been
identified: A, B, and C. Aurora A is initially associated
with centrosomes and then with spindle microtubules,
whereas aurora B is a chromosomal passenger protein
travelling from centromeres to microtubules with its
partners: survivin, INCENP and borealin. Aurora A is
required for centrosome duplication, entry into mitosis,
formation of bipolar spindles, and mitotic checkpoints

kinases have been developed [9, 10]. Several of these
ATP-competitive  inhibitors are currently in clinical
development [11, 12], [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resul
ts?term=%22aurora+kinase%22]. Preliminary data from
clinical trials generally indicate disease stabilisation, with
the best responses achieved in patients suffering from
refractory chronic myeloid leukemia [13].
According to their respective role in mitosis,
specific aurora A inhibitors seemed the most promising
since they induced the death of mitotic cells. Aurora B
kinase inhibition induced mitotic exit and generated
genomic instability [14]. However the best treatment
strategy remains an open question. To date, no class has
been superior in early clinical trials. In phase I studies of
solid tumours, treatment with Aurora A kinase inhibitor
alisertib resulted in only one partial response, although
stable disease was reported in other patients [15, 16].
Similar results were seen with the selective aurora B
kinase inhibitor barasertib, with no responses observed
in advanced solid tumours, in a phase I study [17]. Like
alisertib, barasertib showed more promising clinical
activity in hematologic malignancies, with a response
rate of 25% in patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed
acute myeloid leukemia [18]. Till now none of these drugs
was approved for clinical use. A careful selection of the
patient population may be critical for achieving favourable
therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore promising results
were observed when simultaneously inhibiting aurora
and off-targets like mutated bcr-abl or in synergy with
cancer drugs or radiotherapy. In conclusion, the aurora
kinase inhibitors could not have broad applications in
cancer therapy. Their potential could be evaluated through
a description of the mode of action and will depend on
tumour markers.
In a previous study, we identified benzo[e]
pyridoindolones (BePI) as novel potent inhibitors of the
aurora kinases. The best hit, compound 1, is an ATPcompetitive inhibitor with nanomolar in vitro aurora kinase
inhibitory activity [19, 20] and sensitizes glioma stem cells
to radiation treatment [21]. However, its use was limited
by its low solubility in water. A structure/activity study
opened the possibility to propose hydrosoluble BePI with
high antiproliferative activity [22]. An amino-ethyl chain
engrafted on the scaffold allowed us to prepare the watersoluble salt thereof. The aim of the present study was to
define the best amino chain preserving aurora B inhibition
and to describe its cellular effects. C5M with a pyperidineethoxy group exhibited the highest aurora B inhibition,
in vitro. We showed that C5M could efficiently prevent
proliferation of cells at about 100 nM. Actually, C5M
prevented cell cycling, induced a strong mitotic arrest then,
cells became polyploid and finally died. Conversely to
compound 1, C5M did not impair the spindle checkpoint,
the segregation of daughter chromatids and the transfer of
aurora B on the mid-zone. The mitotic drug C5M was found

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to be a multikinase inhibitor, with restraint selectivity, that
prevented histone H3 phosphorylation at mitotic entry and
erased AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation in late anaphase.
These are unique features for aurora B kinase inhibitors.
Moreover C5M has interesting preclinical characteristics
and prevents tumour growth both in multicellular spheroids
and in xenograft models.

RESULTS
New benzo[e]pyridoindolones
We previously showed that benzo[e]pyridoindolones
(BePI) C3 and C4, recalled in Figure 1A and 1B, are potent
inhibitors of aurora kinase B exhibiting antiproliferative
activity in HeLa cells [22]. The presence of an amino
function in the side chain opens the possibility to prepare
the maleate salt of these BePI and to increase their
solubility in water.
An Et substituent at position 8 was slightly
more favourable than a methyl group, in terms of
anti-proliferation activity (Figure 1B), but this slight
gain of activity could not compensate the low yield of
synthesis of these compounds. Actually, the first step
is the preparation of an alkylated pyridone. Whereas
the methylated pyridone derivative is prepared in
83% yield, with simple purification, the yield for the
ethylated counterpart is not exceeding 25%, with a
tedious purification. Therefore, the new compounds
proposed are 8-Me analogues. It should be mentioned
that the anchoring site for the amine chain was selected
on the 3-position, as the importance of the substituent
group at this position was demonstrated in our previous
studies [22]. Indeed, the deletion of the methoxy group
or their displacement from the 3- to the 4-position lead
to less active compounds [22]. We therefore attempted
to introduce side chains commonly encountered in
medicinal chemistry like pyperidine-ethoxy, (C5) or
morpholino-ethoxy chain (C6). These substitutions
preserved and even increased the inhibitory activity
estimated by the phosphorylation of histone H3 on
Ser10 when compared to compound C3. Conversely the
introduction of a methoxy-ethoxy group induced a loss
of aurora kinase inhibition. C7 had similar inhibition
than C2, a compound bearing an OMe at this 3-position
[22], suggesting an advantage for the amine entity or at
least for a large chain at this position. We confirmed,
on this series, that the presence of the lactame group
on BePI is a requirement for aurora kinase inhibition
(Figure 1B, [22]). The free base compounds (Cx) and
their corresponding maleate salt (CxM) had a similar
aurora B-kinase inhibition. We decided to further
characterized the most active compound 3-(2-(Piperidin1-yl)ethoxy)-8-methyl-7H, 10H-benzo[e]pyrido(4, 3-b)
indol-11-one maleate: C5M.

of incubation whereas none cells were cycling (only 2%
in G1). Progressively, we observed the apparition of a sub
G1 population of cells that accounted for 13% at 30 h and
70% at 72 h (Figure 1C). Meanwhile, C4M and AZD1152
induced mitotic arrest and polyploidisation but, some
cells reinitiated a new cycle (Figure 1D), the proportion
of the cells in G0/G1 was found high even after 50 h of
treatment (33% for C4M and ranging from 41% to 22%
for different AZD1152 concentrations). In conclusion,
C5M differently affected mitotic cells compared to known
drugs, it perturbed mitosis exit and normal cell cycling; it
induced the polyploidisation and finally caused cell death.

We tested the behaviour of cells treated with C5M.
HeLa cells were synchronized at the S phase, and the
compound (100 nM) was added upon release. Cell cycle
analysis following 3, 8, 11, 30 and 72 h of compound
treatment are presented in Figure 1C. After 11 h of
treatment, cells in the control entered a new cycle (52%
in G1) whereas the treated cells were primarily arrested in
the G2/M population (92%). Finally these cells underwent
polyploid, the > 4N population represented 65% after 30 h

Figure 1: Efficiency of new benzopyridoindolones. A. Inhibition of histone H3 phosphorylation. The molecules are represented on

the upper part. Both C3 and C4 bear an amino-ethoxy group in position 3 and differ by the length of the alkyl group in position 8. C5, C6
and C7 respectively exhibit a pyperidine-ethoxy, a morpholino-ethoxy and a methoxy-ethoxy group. By condensation with maleic acid,
we obtained the corresponding soluble salts (C3M to C6M). The inhibition activity was evaluated by western blotting. HeLa cells were
incubated overnight with the different compounds (Cx and CxM, 500 nM) or DMSO (Co) in the presence of nocodazole (0.1 mg/mL) Blots
were revealed by an anti-phospho Ser10-histone H3 (H3S10-P). Aurora B-kinase detection allowed the estimation of the amount of mitotic
cells. B. The main information derived from our former work is recalled in a Table in comparison to C5M characteristics. C. Effect of
C5M on cell cycle progression. HeLa cells were synchronized in S-phase by serum deprivation (48 h) and then, by thymidine block (20 h).
Upon release, they were incubated with C5M (100 nM, shown on the right) for 3 h, 8 h, 11 h, 30 h and 72 h and compared to control (left
part). DNA was stained with propidium iodine and samples were analysed by FACS. The percentage of cells in the different phases, except
S-phase, was indicated in each panel. D. Comparative cell cycle progression in the presence of either C5M (100 nM) or C13b/C4M (nM) or

of the drug then, cell cycle was conducted as above.

Antiproliferative activity of C5M

at 75 min, a became a binuclei interphasic cell as clearly
visualized on the 3D image. Cell b was in prophase at T0
and progressed in mitosis but chromosome segregation
failed. Cell c was in prometaphase at T0 and went in
metaphase (8 min) and chromosomes partly segregated
but they were still connected at 130 min. Cell d also
illustrated the failure of chromosome segregation or at
least a non-equilibrated separation that conducted again to
a polynuclei cell (Figure 3B). We observed HeLa spread
metaphases (Figure 3C). Cells were enriched in mitosis
either by taxol (33 nM) or by C5M (200 nM). In the taxol
experiment, we noted resolved chromosomes connected
by their centromere. The situation is more complex
in cells treated by C5M since in addition to normal
metaphasic figures (a and b), we had a large proportion
of cells exhibiting individual chromosomes (c and d). In
d, individual chromosomes seemed to be decondensed, a
feature not expected upon anaphase onset since maximal
compaction occurs in late anaphase. The proportion
of individual chromatid versus attached chromatid is
around 73% with C5M for less than 2% with taxol. We
could also note the presence of cells with mis-segregated
chromosomes or connected chromatin (e and f) that were
never observed with taxol.
In mitosis, the axis of division is driven by
cytoskeleton and is pre-established before metaphase.
Under C5M treatment, we observed unusual movements of
chromatin (Figure 3B, cells c t70 and 75 min and cell d T0
and 8 min) and we wondered what happened to the mitotic
spindle (Figure 4). Immunofluorescence experiments
realized on HeLa cells revealed that the tubulin spindle
was reduced in the presence of C5M and did not seem to
be stabilized by the actin basket as in the control (compare
the 3D-projections in Figure 4A). Time-Lapse experiments
with Hek-293 cells expressing GFP-α-tubulin allowed the
description of the mitotic spindle under C5M treatment
(Figure 4B). In control conditions, the two centrosomes
appeared, they migrated at opposite sites and they indicated
the orientation of the spindle. In metaphase, the spindle is
at equal distance from the cell surface (Figure 4A). Upon
C5M treatment, the spindle was found normally localized
at mitotic entry but then, it loose this central localization
and finally turned in the opposite direction (Figure 4B, T0,
27 min and 65 min). Progressively the spindle disappeared
and the cell spread on the substrate, escaping mitosis
without any segregation (neither chromosomes, nor
cytoplasm, Figure 4B, 190 min). The mis-orientation of
the spindle and its regression was systematically observed
in the presence of C5M.

We evaluated the anti-proliferative activity of
C5M through the viability of tumour HeLa cells upon
96 h of treatment. A concentration of 83 ± 8 nM was
found to reduce by half HeLa cell proliferation (in-cell
IC50). We extended this study to a large panel of cell
lines (Figure 2A). We showed that C5M could efficiently
prevent proliferation of cells from different origins like
Mahlavu liver carcinoma (IC50 of 84 nM), Jurkat T-cell
leukemia (IC50 of 133 nM), breast adenocarcinoma
MCF-7 (IC50 of 138 nM). C5M efficiency varied a lot
since high IC50 of several μM were also measured
(Figure  2A). Interestingly C5M prevented normal
HUVEC proliferation (IC50 of 205 nM). To start to
understand these differences of efficiency we compared
the C5M treatment in genetically modified hct116 cells.
C5M appeared more efficient in p53+ than p53- cells (at
1 μM, 65% of inhibition versus 22%) whereas Chk2 was
not found important (Figure 2B). Only a slow decrease of
efficiency was observed in its absence (at 1 μM, 61% of
inhibition versus 72% in hct116 chk2+ cells).
We checked whether C5M could be combined
to known therapies (Figure 2C). The association with
DNA damaging agents (cisplatin and irinotecan) was not
favourable. Alcaloid agents may have some benefit if the
cells are primed with C5M since additive effects were
observed. Vorinostat, an HDAC inhibitor, known to block
cells in G2/M had a synergic effect if simultaneously
added with C5M. C5M had a synergic effect with
Endoxan, an inhibitor of transcription and gemcitabine,
an analogue of deoxicitosine, when added upon one day
of action.

Time-lapse experiments
First, we took advantage of a specific phosphoaurora antibody that recognized activated kinases A/B
and C to check the specificity of C5M, within this family,
in HeLa cells (Figure 3A). Centromeres were decorated
by survivin-GFP. C5M and AZD1152 prevented the
phosphorylation of aurora B (Thr232) on the centromere
whereas the centrosomes were still decorated by phosphoaurora A (Thr288). In cells, C5M (200 nM) targeted
Aurora B not A.
To better describe the action of C5M we performed
time-lapse experiments in Hek-293 cells stably expressing
histone H2A-GFP. Mitotic cells were selected and
continuously imaged. C5M was added just before
imaging and the treated cells were compared to control
(Figure 3B). In control, the prometaphasic cell underwent
in metaphase (t = 60 min), then in anaphase (90 min) and
finally the two lots of chromosomes segregated (104 min).
In the presence of C5M, four different mitotic cells are
shown (from a to d), a 2D-plan and a 3D-reconstitution
are provided. At T0, a appeared as a metaphasic cell but,
70 min later, chromosomes are still compacted and finally,

(Figure 5B, a). In control conditions, centromeres decorated
by survivin were surrounded by phospho-AMPK suggesting
an outer centromeric localization for this mark. Conversely
phospho-AMPK signal was more diffuse in metaphasic
C5M-treated cells (Figure 5B, a). In anaphase, phosphoAMP-Thr172 was found mostly present on the spindle,
in close contact to survivin (Figure  5B, b). Upon C5M
treatment survivin was transferred to the spindle but the
phospho-AMP-Thr172 signal was very low and poorly
organized (Figure 5B, b). Finally on telophase, phosphoAMP-Thr172 and survivin co-localised on the mid-body
(Figure 5B, c). C5M perturbed the mid-body organization
and clearly the survivin and phospho-AMP-Thr172 signals
were not co-localised (Figure 5B, c). Actually, except in
pro-metaphases, the phospho-AMP-Thr172 signal was very
low in C5M treated cells (Figure 5B). The next question
was the possible inhibition of AMPK in interphasic cells.
We noted that the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 did
not decreased, in cells, whatever the time of treatment
(1 h, 26 h or 48 h, data not shown) indicating no long term
impairment of this signalling [25]. The possibility of a
short-term inhibition was evaluated. We activated AMPK
in HeLa and TSA-pc cells by a hypertonic stress for 10 min.
As shown in Figure 5C, the signal of phospho-AMPK
(Thr172) was found identical in control (WO C5M) and in
cells pre-incubated with C5M (200 nM, for 1 h, W C5M).
The efficiency of C5M upon one hour of treatment was
verified on anaphase cells.
The extinction of phospho-AMPK signal in late
mitosis prompts us to characterize the profile of inhibition
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of C5M (250 nM) towards 137 major kinases. C5M was
found to be a multikinase inhibitor with restraint selectivity
for few kinases (Figure 6A). C5M is specific to aurora
B-kinase versus aurora-A and we determined an IC50 of
118 nM for kinase B (Figure 6B). Among the fifteen best
targets, we noted the presence of several AMPK-related
kinases (Nuak1, Sik2 and Melk) as well as AMPK upstream
regulator kinases (Tak1 and CaMKKβ). These data were
confirmed by the determinations of few in vitro-IC50
(Figure 6B). In vitro, IC50 found for the AMPK–related
kinases ARK5/Nuak1, Sik2, Melk and Tak 1, are 4.8 nM,
12.4 nM, 13.3 nM and 6 nM respectively. Interestingly we
reported IC50 of 13.6 nM for Chk2 and Chk1, 18.5 nM
for phosphorylase kinase and 37 nM for Flt1/V-EGFR1. To
further evaluate C5M, some preclinical characteristics were
determined (Figure 6C). C5M was found to be hydrosoluble
with solubility higher than 20 mg/mL in water. Its passive
permeability across reconstituted membranes was
found low but time-lapse experiments indicated a quick
cytoplasmic distribution upon addition on cells. C5M had
quite no affinity for membranes (9% retained) and bound to
plasmatic proteins (80%). This molecule had a nice stability
in plasma as well in liver microsomes since 100% of C5M
was recovered after 1 h of incubation (Figure 6C).

Anti-proliferative activity in spheroids
and in vivo
Altogether these data indicated that C5M could
have potency as antiproliferating drug. We therefore

decided to evaluate C5M on tumour models. First,
we incubated C5M (1 μM) with complex spheroids
composed of mammary tumour cells (TS/A-pc) alone
or mixed with normal fibroblast (NIH-3T3 cells) and
endothelial cells (Ea. hy926 cells) in order to mimic
tumour heterogeneity (Figure 7A–7C). Spheroids were
around 300 μm in diameter when the drug was added and
they were followed for 7 days. Control spheroids grew
exponentially as indicated by the curves ((Figure 7A–7C,
diamond symbols). At day 2, we already observed  an
impressive decrease of the TS/A-pc spheroid size
(a decrease by 43% of the area encompassing the largest
”diameter”, see Figure 7A, square symbol). Finally, large
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells appeared in the periphery and the treated spheroids
were quite five times smaller than in control. A single dose
of C5M prevented the growth of mixed spheroids and even
decreased their size by 74% and 70% for TS/A-3T3 and
TS/A-3T3-Ea. hy respectively within 7 days of treatment
(Figure 7B and 7C).
Moreover spheroids were found to remodel during
the experiment whereas in the presence of C5M they
mostly keep a round, compact shape (Figure 7B and  7C
especially). In conclusion, C5M was found efficient towards
a 3D-structure mimicking the complex tumour environment
and its effect lasted through time. We wonder whether
C5M could be safely injected to animals. We established

significantly smaller in the treated group compared to control

development. Again its effects lasted through time.

salt formation to obtain a hydrosoluble compound (C5M).
The molecule is rather small (MW 377 for the free base),
a characteristic reported to be positive for clinical trials.
Cell cycle analysis of HeLa cells treated by C5M
(100 nM) indicated a strong mitotic arrest then, cells became
polyploid and finally died. C5M is a high antiproliferative
mitotic drug. C5M could efficiently prevent proliferation of
cells from different origins like Mahlavu liver carcinoma,
Jurkat T-cell leukemia, MCF-7 and TS/A-pc breast
adenocarcinoma, but also endothelial proliferative HUVEC.

Fluorescent time-lapse experiments revealed
how C5M affected mitosis on-going. The effects were
observed without delay suggesting good cell permeability.
Chromosomes condensed and quite perfectly aligned
in metaphase. But even when two lots of chromosomes
could be discriminated they did not segregate. Actually,
the daughter chromatids were found separated, neither
the cohesin removal, nor the centromere separations were
perturbed. The full condensation arising in late anaphase
seemed affected since we observed long individual

chromatids. During anaphase, a maximal chromosome
compaction was described that occurred by a mechanism
of axial shortening of the chromatid arms from telomere to
centromere and whose impairment resulted in multilobed
daughter nuclei [26]. This chromatid axial shortening was
reported to depend on dynamic microtubules and aurora
B kinase activity [26]. Most aurora B kinase inhibitors
prevented chromosome alignment on the metaphasic plate,
induced a delocalisation of aurora kinase from centromere
on the whole chromosome and finally the cells escape
from mitosis [19]. Although C5M prevented histone H3
phosphorylation, it mostly affected late mitosis steps since
aurora kinase and survivin were transferred to the central
spindle, a sign of anaphase onset. The transfer of the
Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) on the mitotic
spindle was not reproduced with AZD1152, a specific aurora
B kinase inhibitor [27]. These peculiar features of C5M
could be due to the simultaneous inhibition of mitotic offtargets like Chk1 or Melk (in vitro IC50 around 13 nM) in
addition to aurora B. Melk belongs to the AMPKr family
and was mostly involved in cytokinesis [28]. Checkpoint
kinase 1 (Chk1) is a well-established component in the DNA
damage and DNA replication pathways [29] but it is also
involved in optimal chromosome segregation as well as in
spindle checkpoint signalling. Chk1 is required for correction
of merotelic attachments during a prolonged metaphase and
it phosphorylates aurora-B at Ser331 a  phosphorylation
essential for optimal spindle checkpoint function [30, 31].
C5M effects could thus result from the co-inhibition of
several mitotic kinases. C5M, with its unusual aurora kinase
inhibition profile, is a tool for proving aurora B actions
in late mitosis. Sharp specific aurora B inhibitors were
described to induce neutropenia [32], an adverse side effect
that could limit their clinical use. In contrast, the potential
benefit/risk window provided by drugs with the multitargeting strategies still need to be addressed but may present
lower toxicities. Presently several multikinase inhibitors are
in clinical trials [33].
During this study, we could not detect phosphoThr172 AMPK on the mitotic spindle whereas this
phosphorylation was present on centrosomes. AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK) firstly studied as a
central metabolic stress sensor was described to ensure
proper cell division and faithful chromosomal segregation
during mitosis. P-Thr172 –AMPK corresponded to a fully
activated kinase but the modification was found dispensable
for maximal activity [34]. AMPK could be phosphorylated
by LKB1, calmodulin-KKb and TGF-ß-activated-k1 [35].
Our observations were performed in LKB1 negative cells,
but CAMKKb and Tak-1 are in vitro-targets for C5M,
appearing in the top fifteen. Moreover it was reported that
AMPK regulates mitotic spindle orientation through the
phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (P-MLRC)
[24]. C5M perturbed spindle orientation but MRLC was
found fully phosphorylated (data not shown). The spindle
defects preceded the decrease of AMPK phosphorylation
that could be due to the absence of stabilisation/tension
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

on centrosomes. Does C5M directly prevent AMPK
phosphorylation or is it a consequence of an inactive CPC,
the question is opened. Actually, AMPK substrate like
acetyl-CoA carboxylase [36] and phospho-active forms of
proteins belonging to the AMPK/mTOR/S6K1 signalling
axis localized on the cleavage furrow in close vicinity to the
CPC [37]. How AMPKα activation is controlled spatially
and temporally during mitosis, remained undiscovered.
C5M could be useful for understanding the role of phosphoAMPK, in abscission and the relationship between the CPC
and the energy sensing machinery. We noted that C5M had
no effect on interphasic and centrosomic phospho-AMPK
signals. The mitotic selectivity of C5M and its failure of
inhibition of metabolic AMPK could be positive features in
terms of cancer therapy. Actually, several clinical assays are
based on AMPK activation by metformine [38]
C5M is an efficient mitotic anti-proliferative drug that
could target both tumour cells and neo-vessels around. C5M
prevented the proliferation of endothelial cells, possibly
through Flt-1/V-EGF-R1. The preclinical characterization
revealed its high hydro-solubility and a good stability in
plasma as well in liver microsomes. Accordingly, a single
dose was found efficient for preventing tumour growth in
multicellular spheroids and quite long-term effects were
noted in liver Malhavu xenografts in nude mice. In vivo
assays demonstrated that C5M could be safely injected to
mice. The next step will be to define the mode and area
of applications of this new anti-proliferative drug and
to evaluate its potency as a radio-sensitizer, a property of
the parental molecule C1 [21]. Combined chemotherapies
including C5M could be promising.

and the mixture was heated under reflux for 2.5 h. The
reaction mixture was cooled and organic layer was
separated. The aqueous layer was extracted by AcOEt
and the organic layers were combined, washed with brine,
dried over MgSO4 and evaporated in vacuum. The residue
was purified by flash chromatography (neutral alumina,

Compound characterization
The half maximal inhibitory concentration of the
compound (IC50) and the kinase profiling were performed
at the MRC (Dundee) with a panel of recombinant
enzymes. All assays were run in duplicate and the ATP
concentration adjusted at the Km value for each kinase.
Preclinical determinations were done at the CNRSplatform TechMedILL (Strasbourg, France; http://www
.pcbis.fr/fr/TechMed-IntroductionPresentation)

Cell lines
Most cell lines obtained from ATCC were cultured
under suggested conditions. HUVEC cells from Lonza
(Levallois, France) were cultured as suggested by the
supplier. TS/A-pc cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
media supplemented with 1% glutamine, 10% foetal
bovine serum, 25 μM β-mercaptoethanol. HeLa cells
stably expressing survivin-GFP and Hek-293 expressing
either histone H2A-GFP or GFP-α-tubulin were already
described [20, 42]. Genetically modified hct116 cells were
a gift from Dr B. Vogelstein. HeLa cells were synchronized
at S phase by serum deprivation for 2 days followed by a
thymidine block (3 mM) for 20 hours. After PBS washing,
cells were then either allowed to grow in normal condition
or in the presence of C5M (100 nM). Alternatively, HeLa
cells were synchronized in prometaphase by nocodazole
(0.33 μM, ON). For stress induction, culture medium
(or  PBS for H2O2) was replaced by freshly prepared
medium to which 125 mM NaCl was added, yielding a
final concentration of 275 mM [43]. Compounds for
combined chemotherapy were from Sigma Aldrich.

A mixture of 11-chloro-3-(2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethoxy)8-methyl-7H-benzo(e)pyrido(4, 3-b)indole (630 mg, 1.60
mmol), sodium acetate (600 mg, 7.2 mmol) and AcOH (40
ml) was heated under reflux, for 18 h. The volatile material
was first evaporated in vacuum and then co-evaporated
with toluene. Water (150 ml) was added and the medium
was basified by addition of sodium hydroxide (2 N). The
aqueous layer was extracted by AcOEt/EtOH:95/5, dried
over MgSO4 and evaporated in vacuum to give the title free
base of C5 (590 mg, 98%).1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6)

Multicellular tumour spheroid (MTS) models
Spheroids were first generated by plating TS/Apc cells at 2000 cells/well into ultra low adherence -96well plates (Corning, Tewksbury, USA) [6]. These plates
stimulate spontaneous formation of a single spheroid of
cells, within 24 hours of incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2.
Three day later, medium or 1000 NIH-3T3 cells or 800
NIH-3T3 and 800 EA. hy926 cells were added to wells.
Next day (D0 on Figure 7) medium or C5M (final
concentration of 1 μM) were added. The final volume is
the same for all the wells (200 μL/well). Spheroids culture
is performed in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 1%
glutamine and 10% foetal bovine serum.

Spheroids were imaged, each day, with a
10-X objective and then the area of the larger section was
measured for each spheroid by Image J software.

ZEISS 710 Laser Scanning Confocal microscope with a
63×-immersion oil objective. Slices of 0.5 μm are shown.
Metaphases spreading were realized as follows:
HeLa cells were incubated ON with either C5M (200 nM)
or taxol (33 nM) and were then recovered by flushing.
An osmotic choc was realized (calf serum diluted in
water  1:5) for 13 min, at 37°C, then the same volume
of fixative (mixture of EtOH and acetic acid (3:1)) was
added. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature,
cells were washed by fixative and stored at 4°C. Finally
cells were spread on cold coverglass and DNA was stained
with Hoechst.

Western blot
Cells treated by compounds or DMSO (control, Co)
or PBS (Co) were harvested and lysed in 9M urea, finally
supplemented with Laemmli sample buffer as described
previously [40]. AMPK detections were performed on
RIPA-cell extracts. Western blots were performed using
the following antibodies: rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3
(Ser10) (Upstate, 1:2000); rabbit anti-aurora B (Epitomics,
1:5000); rabbit anti-phospho-AMPK (Thr172) (Cell
Signaling, 1:1000); rabbit anti-AMPK (Cell Signaling,
1:1000); mouse ß-actin (Sigma, 1:5000). Bands were
visualized by horseradish peroxidase labelled antibodies
and ECL technique (Amersham Bioscience). Images were
observed by ChemiDoc MP system (Biorad).

Time lapse
Ex vivo experiments were conducted on cells
grown on Lab-Tek chambered coverglass (Nalgen Nunc
International) and maintained under standard culture
conditions (37°C, 5% CO2). Images were acquired
on a Zeiss dynascope confocal microscope using a
PlanApochromat 40× water immersion objective. Images
were analysed with the Zen software provided by Zeiss.
C5M was added just before imaging.
At least 10 mitotic cells were simultaneously
followed and three independent experiments were
conducted.

Cell cycle analysis
HeLa cells were synchronized at S phase. After
release, they were treated by C5M (100 nM), for 3, 8,
11, 30 and 72 hours and compared to control cells. For
determination of cell cycle profiles, cells were fixed by
ice-cold 70% ethanol, for 1 hour, and then, incubated with
propidium iodide solution (50 μg/ml) in the presence of
0.2 mg/ml RNase A for 15 minutes, at 37°C. DNA content
was measured using the BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences, US) and CFlow Plus software.

Xenografts
The protocol was evaluated by the local ethic
committee and was conducted by a habilitated
researcher. In-vivo experiments were performed on
four-week old female Swiss nude mice (Janvier, France).
After one week of adaptation with their environment
conditions, mice were injected subcutaneously with
3.5 × 106 Mahlavu cells. Cells suspended in PBS
were mixed 1:1 with cold growth factor free matrigel
(Beckton Dikinson). Tumours were established after
7 days. At this time, the mice were randomly divided
into 2 groups, which equalled in the mean tumour size
of each group. Tumour volume was determined by
measuring two perpendicular diameters using a clipper
and then calculated as follows: V = 4/3 π d12 × d2 in
which d1 and d2 are the smallest and the largest diameter,
respectively. One mice group (6 mice) received the
treatment of C5M in NaCl 0.45% (100 μg compound per
each 20 gr of mouse) whereas the control group (6 mice)
was injected with NaCl 0.45% only. The compound or
control buffer injections were carried out 4 times per
week, stopped 1 day between 2 times. Totally, mice
received 11 injections. The size of the tumour and
the weight of each mouse were determined twice per
week. Tumour growth was calculated by measuring the
variations in volume during the drug or control treatment
using the formula: (Vn –V0)/V0. The mean values were
determined by 6 mice, in each group.

Cell viability
Cell proliferation assays were conducted in 96well culture plates. Assays were run in triplicate. Serial
dilutions of compounds were prepared from 10 nM to
2 μM and the viable cell number was determined, at day 4,
by the addition of MTS (Promega) or WST-8 (Promokine).
In most cases, two to three different experiments were run.

Immunofluorescence
Hela cells grown on glass coverslips were treated
by C5M (100 nM) or water (control, Co) in different trials
and then, fixed by formaldehyde 4% for 10 minutes at
37°C. Immunofluorescences were performed as described
previously [40]. Coverslips were incubated with the
antibodies directed against the following antigens:
phospho-histone H3-Serine10 (Upstate, 1:2000); phosphohistone H3-Serine 28 (Upstate, 1:2000); aurora kinase B
(Epitomics, 1:2000); rabbit anti-phospho-AMPK (Thr172)
(Cell Signaling, 1:100), rabbit anti-phospho-aurora A/B/C
(Cell Signaling, 1:100). Actin was stained by phalloidinrhodamin (1 μg/ml). DNA was visualized with Hoechst
33342 (Sigma, 0.5 μg/ml). Images were collected with a
