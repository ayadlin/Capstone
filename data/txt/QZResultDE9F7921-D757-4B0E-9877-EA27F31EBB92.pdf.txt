ABSTRACT
Despite the availability of various anticancer agents, Multiple Myeloma (MM)
remains incurable in most cases, along with high relapse rate in the patients treated
with these agents. The year 2015 saw major advancements in our battle against
multiple myeloma. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
three new therapies for multiple myeloma, namely Ixazomib (an oral proteasome
inhibitor), Daratumumab and Elotuzumab (monoclonal antibodies against CD38 and
SLAMF7 respectively). The purpose of this review is to provide a detailed analysis of
these aforementioned breakthrough therapies and two other newer agents, Filanesib
(kinesis spindle inhibitor) and selinexor (SINE inhibitor), presented at the 2015
annual meeting of American Society of Hematology (ASH). We also describe the role
of agents targeting PD-1 axis and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells in the
treatment of MM.

INTRODUCTION

The year 2015 saw major advancements in
our battle against MM. In 2015, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved three new therapies for
MM: an oral proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib; along with
two monoclonal antibodies against CD38 and SLAMF7,
daratumumab and elotuzumab, respectively. In this review,
we provide a detailed analysis of these breakthrough
therapies and presentations at the 2015 American Society
of Hematology (ASH) meeting that will ultimately alter
clinical practice in MM. We describe a newer generation
reversible proteasome inhibitor (ixazomib), monoclonal
antibody that recognizes SLAMF7 (elotuzumab) and
CD38 (daratumumab), agents targeting the PD-1 axis and
chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells along with
kinesis spindle inhibitor (Filanesib) and SINE inhibitor
(selinexor).

The neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells that
produce a monoclonal immunoglobulin is a characteristic
of Multiple Myeloma (MM). MM is the 2nd most common
hematological malignancy after lymphomas and forms
10% of all hematological malignancies in the United
States [1]. The American Cancer Society predicts that
about 30,330 new MM cases and 12,650 deaths caused
by MM are expected in the year 2016 [2]. Despite the
improvement in 5 year survival rates for patients with MM
from 25% between 1975 to 1977 to 43% between 2002
and 2008 [3], this disease still remains incurable using
currently available therapies. With detailed understanding
of the key signaling and regulatory pathways of the tumor
and the tumor microenvironment, newer agents are being
discovered and evaluated in clinical trials.

inhibits the chymotrypsin-like activity of beta 5 subunit
of the 20S proteasome. At high concentrations, it inhibits
the caspase-like activity of beta 1 subunit and trypsin-like
activity of beta 2 subunit [9] (Table 1).
While both bortezomib and carfilzomib are given
as injectable preparations, ixazomib is a novel orally
administered PI approved by FDA in 2015 for use along
with dexamethasone and lenalidomide for patients who
were treated previously with at least one therapy. Its
approval was based on the results of a randomized phase
3 TOURMALINE-MM1 study comparing treatment
with ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and
dexamethasone (IRd) to treatment with lenalidomide and
dexamethasone (Rd) alone. The results of which were
presented at the 2015 ASH meeting [10]. Participants in
the trial received one to three prior treatments. Patients
refractory to previous PI- or lenalidomide-based treatment
were excluded from the study. The IRd arm showed a
greater progression free survival (PFS) compared to the
Rd arm (20.6 months versus 14.7 months, p=0.012). The
median overall survival (OS) was not reached in either
arm. The median PFS in patients with unfavorable del (17)
was similar to all other IRd-treated patients, suggesting
that ixazomib may have a favorable effect in patients
with genetic mutations. The reported side effects included
rash, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, nausea, diarrhea and
fatigue, along with a few cases of PN. Given the favorable
toxicity profile [11] and good manageability, the results
of this orally administered chemo-free regimen are highly
encouraging. The drug is being tested further as a frontline
therapy, either with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone

With the advent of proteasome inhibitors (PIs),
the survival of an average MM patient was prolonged
[4]. Bortezomib, the first PI initially approved for use in
relapsed/refractory MM patients, was later extended as a
first-in-line treatment of newly diagnosed MM patients
[5]; however, numerous limitations complicate bortezomib
treatment. Firstly, bortezomib can cause peripheral
neuropathy (PN) in 37-44% of the MM patients. Also,
its effectiveness is not universal as some patients are
unresponsive, and the responders eventually relapse [6].
Carfilzomib is a second generation proteasome
inhibitor (PI) that offers clinical advantage to several
patients who relapse on bortezomib treatment. Also, this
drug has a decreased incidence of PN [7]. However, drug
resistance has been observed with carfilzomib treatment
[7]. An important limitation to the use of both bortezomib
and carfilzomib is that they have to be administered
intravenously (iv), necessitating the administration of these
drugs in a clinical setting, which may hamper patient’s
quality of life and increases the cost of treatment [8].
However, bortezomib is now available in subcutaneous
forms, which causes less peripheral neuropathic side
effects.
Ixazomib (Ninlaro®), a newer generation reversible
PI has clinical advantages compared with other PIs.
Ixazomib acts on the 26S proteasome and inhibits the

(ICD-300 or ICD-400) or with lenalidomide and
dexamethasone (TOURMALINE-MM2 study). The ORR
in the study with ICD-300 and ICD-400 were 80 and 73%,
respectively [12]. Currently, Ixazomib is only approved
for use along with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.
However, ixazomib is under testing for use as a single
agent maintenance therapy in patients after autologous
stem cell transplant (ASCT) and in those who have not
received ASCT [9]. Thrombocytopenia was reported for
ixazomib in 31% of the patients undergoing treatment
[10]. Non hematologic adverse events associated with
ixazomib include gastrointestinal events and rash [13].

There has been a significant improvement in the
survival rate of MM patients in the last 10 years [14].
Despite this progress, the median OS of patients refractory
to both immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and PIs is
only 9 months [15, 16]. Thus, an urgent need exists for
newer agents with novel mechanisms of action [17, 18].
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are novel agents that

Figure 1: Mechanisms of action of monoclonal antibody (Daratumumab) targeting surface CD38 antigen on MM
cells. Daratumumab against CD38 antigen can induce tumor cell killing via Fc-dependent effector mechanisms including CDC, ADCC,

and ADCP. The process of ADCC is achieved through activation of Fc receptors on myeloid and NK effector cells by tumor cell-attached
immunoglobins. Subsequent cytotoxicity is mediated through ≥2 different mechanisms; one involving the release of perforin and
granzymes from effector cells and the other involving death ligands FasL and tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand. In
ADCP, phagocytosis of tumor cells is mediated by macrophages. CDC is dependent on the interaction of the antibody Fc domains with
the classic complement-activating protein C1q leading to activation of downstream complement proteins, which results in the assembly
of the membrane attack complex (MAC), that punches holes in the tumor cells. An additional result of this cascade is the production of
chemotactic complement molecules C3a and C5a, which recruit and activate immune effector cells. There is also evidence that uptake of
antibody-opsonized tumor cells and cellular fragments by antigen-presenting cells is associated with enhanced antigen presentation leading
to tumor-specific T-cell responses. Daratumumab may also have direct effects via modulation of the activity of the targeted antigen and
modulation of enzymatic activity.

activity, and immunomodulatory activity are the various
mechanisms of action for Daratumumab [23-26] (Figure
1). In a phase II trial, single agent daratumumab showed
approximately 30% response rate in heavily pretreated
MM patients [27]. In 2015, Daratumumab, was approved
by the FDA [28] to treat patients with MM who had
received at least 3 prior therapies including either a PI
or an IMiD, or those who are double-refractory to these
drugs.
At the 2015 ASH meeting, researchers reported
results of a phase 1/2 study (GEN503) of Darzalex in
combination with dexamethasone and lenalidomide in
patients who had relapsed or refractory (R/R) MM [29].
After 7.8 months of median follow up, an 88% ORR was
recorded. The PFS and OS were not achieved. The type
and rate of infusion-related reactions were similar to those
reported in studies of Darzalex monotherapy. Toxicity
was common but was not increased as compared to that
caused by lenalidomide/dexamethasone. The combined
analysis of the GEN501 and SIRIUS trials that studied

compared to other hematological and solid tissues. Plasma
cell tumors such as MM highly express CD38, which led
to the development of therapeutic anti- CD38 antibodies
[22].

monoclonal antibody directed against CD38 antigen, is

daratumumab as a monotherapy in R/R MM (relapsed
or refractory multiple myeloma) created much interest
[30]. Despite the ORR being 31%, a median OS of 20.1
months was reported on the combined analysis of the
two trials. The median OS was not reached among the
responders, while in those with minimal or no response,
OS was reported to be 17.5 months, which favorably
compared with historical controls. Another open label,
multicenter study of Darzalex investigated the drug in
combination with Pomalyst (pomalidomide, Imnovid)
and dexamethasone in R/R MM patients with at least two
lines of prior therapy [31]. The ORR was 58.5%, including
a 57.5% response rate in patients who were doublerefractory to a PI and an IMiD. After a median followup of 4.2 months, the six-month estimated PFS was 66%,
and no additional safety concerns were noted. The most
common hematological side effects of any grade (≥20%)
were anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia [27, 31].

located on chromosome 1q23 [32]. SLAMF7 expression is
high in myeloma cells and natural killer (NK) cells but not
on normal tissues, making CS1 a potential target for MM
immunotherapies [33].
Elotuzumab (Empliciti™) is a humanized
immunoglobulin (Ig) G1-k monoclonal antibody targeting
CS1. NK cell-mediated ADCC through the CD 16
pathway is the predominant elotuzumab mechanism of
action [33]. Elotuzumab activates natural killer cells
through Fc receptors and the SLAMF7 pathway. After
binding to CS1, elotuzumab binds to CD16 on NK cells,
activating the NK cell and leading to release of cytotoxic
granules, eventually leading to MM cell death [34]. CS1
activates NK cells by coupling with EWS/FLI1 Activated
Transcript 2 (EAT-2). In MM cells, CS1 signaling is
compromised due to absence of EAT-2 expression; thus,
it does not affect the proliferation of MM cells [35, 36].
Elotuzumab also impairs adhesion of MM cells to bone
marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) [37](Figure 2).
Elotuzumab lacks single-agent activity, unlike
the anti-CD38 antibodies. However, this antibody has
synergistic activity when combined with dexamethasone

plus lenalidomide (Rd) [38]. The combination of
elotuzumab with Rd showed a 30% risk reduction for
disease progression and death in patients with R/R MM.
These interim results of a landmark ELOQUENT-2 phase
3 trial, presented at ASCO 2015, are the largest analysis
of a monoclonal antibody in MM and the first positive
findings for a targeted immunotherapy approach in a phase
3 clinical trial in patients with MM. Based on this study,
elotuzumab was declared a breakthrough therapy by the
U.S. FDA for patients who have received ≥1 previous
therapies for MM [39].
At the ASH meeting, updated data provided longer
follow-up results of the ELOQUENT-2 phase 3 trial
[40]. Previously, at a median follow-up of 24 months,
the PFS rates were 41% in the triple-therapy arm of
ERd and 27% Rd alone (P = .004). At 1 year, the PFS
rates were 68% and 57%, respectively. The OS rates
were 79% and 66% (P = .002), respectively. In the ASH
update, the 3-year PFS rates were 26% and 18% in the
two arms, respectively. A time-to-next-treatment analysis
favored the Empliciti arm (33 months versus 23 months).
Interim OS analysis showed a trend in favor of ERd.
Furthermore, a phase 2 randomized study of lenalidomide
and dexamethasone combined with elotuzumab versus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone without elotuzumab
showed promising results as well [41].The median PFS
figures were 9.9 months versus 6.8 months. The two-year
follow-up showed a 24% reduction in the risk of disease
progression, and OS analysis showed a 25% reduction in
the risk of death, with no significant increases in adverse
events. However, being a phase 2 study, the trial was
not powered to assess the true benefit of elotuzumab in
combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone. Of
note, elotuzumab activity against disease with high risk
cytogenetic features such as t (4; 14) and del (17p) has
been reported [42]. These patients typically have less
benefit from conventional therapies. The common adverse
events for elotuzumab are hematological adverse events.
In Lonial et al’s study 34% of patients had neutropenia
(grade 3/4) in elotuzumab group versus 44% in the control
group; lymphocytopenia (grade 3/4) was reported in 77%
and 49% of patients, respectively [42].
Up until this point, we have analyzed the three MM
therapies newly approved by the U.S. FDA. The pivotal
efficacy results and the main toxicities of these are shown
in Table 2.

activated macrophages, B cells, T cells, NK cells, NKT
cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) [43]. Binding of PD-1
to PD-L1 (B7-H1) and PD-L2 (B7-DC) ligands causes
activated T-cell apoptosis via negative signaling [45].
The higher expression of SHP-2, a cytoplasmic SH2
domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase, causes
the inhibition of the PI3K pathway and the subsequent
inhibition of AKT. This results in a decreased production
of Bcl-xL, a molecule associated with the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway [43] (Figure 3). The end result of the
PD-1 pathway is immune tolerance [46]. Cancer cells
utilize the PD-1 pathway through expression of PD-L1
on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) [47] leading to
impairment of anti-tumor responses [48]. Thus, antibodies
targeting the PD-1 axis “release the brakes” on T-effectors
causing anti-tumor cytotoxicity [49]. The presence of
PD-1 on T-regulatory (Treg), B- and NK-cells enhances
anti-tumor cytotoxicity through increased NK cellmediated killing and Treg suppression via PD-1 blockade
[50, 51].
Currently, the use of anti PD-1 agents is a “hot
topic” in cancer therapeutics. Two widely marketed
anti PD-1 agents, pembrolizumab and nivolumab (IgG4
isotype antibodies), have both been approved in squamous
non–small-cell lung cancer and melanoma. PD-1 blockade
as a treatment option in MM has been investigated in
various clinical trials, with disappointing results in general
[52]. 27 patients with R/R MM were enrolled in an active
phase I trial of nivolumab in hematologic malignancies.
The preliminary results of the trial were reported at the
2014 ASH Annual Meeting [53]. Although no objective
response was observed in this study, 18 patients (67%) had
stable disease, and the PFS at 24 weeks was 15%.
At the 2015 ASH meeting, pembrolizumab
(KEYTRUDA) showed a much more robust response
when combined with immune-modulatory drugs.
Pembrolizumab was tested as a combination therapy with
lenalidomide and dexamethasone for patients with R/R
MM in the KEYNOTE-023 phase 1 trial [54]. An ORR
of 76% was observed with a recommended fixed dose of
200 mg. In another study presented at the ASH meeting,
Pembroluzimab was combined with pomalidomide and
dexamethasone in patients with R/R MM [55]. The trial
enrolled 33 patients, of whom 23 (70%) were refractory to
an immunomodulatory drug and a proteasome inhibitor.
An ORR of 60% in 27 evaluable patients was observed.
The response rate was 55% in 20 patients who were
refractory to both IMiD and PI.

OTHER NOVEL AGENTS

antigen-binding domain from a B cell receptor that is
fused to the intracellular domain of a CD3 T-cell receptor
(CD3-zeta), have shown activity in CD-19 related disease
[56]. Although 95% of MM patients do not express
CD19 on their tumor cells, CAR T-cells have been used
effectively to induce remission in MM patients. One
way to improve the outcomes of CAR T-cell treatment
in MM patients is to develop effective immunotherapies
targeting antigens expressed by MM cells. A fitting target
for CAR T-cell therapy of MM had not been previously
identified because most proteins expressed on MM cells
are also expressed on essential normal cells. Both B-cell
maturation antigen (BCMA) and CS1 have been identified
as promising immunotherapeutic targets in MM [57, 58].
BCMA is expressed in mature B cells and plasma cells
and promotes the survival of long-lived plasma cells
[59]. BCMA expression is high in most, if not all, MM
cells. A wide range screening of normal human tissues by
immunohistochemistry revealed no expression of BCMA
except in lymphoid tissue, suggesting that an anti-BCMA
CAR T-cell therapy will have favorable efficacy in MM
[57].
At the ASH 2015 meeting, impressive results were
reported by Dr. Kochenderfer regarding novel CAR T-cell
therapy targeting BCMA [60]. This dose-escalating phase
1 trial enrolled a total of 12 heavily pretreated patients.
Each patient received a single infusion of their modified
T cells after first being administered cyclophosphamide
300 mg/m2 and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 for three days.
Among the two patients who received the maximum dose,
one patient showed a complete and durable remission.
However, sings of cytokine release syndrome occurred,
necessitating management.

Filanesib (kinesin spindle inhibitor)
Filanesib (Arry-520) is a kinesin spindle protein
inhibitor that arrests cells undergoing mitosis and
promotes apoptosis [61]. In highly refractory MM
patients, single agent Filanesib resulted in a 16% PR
and when in combination with dexamethasone, the PR
increased to 22%. Filanesib in combination with low dose
dexamethasone has shown a manageable safety profile
[62]. The drug is also being tried in other combinations
with PIs (bortezomib or carfilzomib). A phase I study in
combination with bortezomib reported an ORR of 42%
and the combination was found to be well-tolerated [63].
Shah et al. reported a 42% ORR (≥ PR) and 52% clinical
benefit rate (≥ MR) for the combination with carfilzomib
in the phase 1 study [64] [53]. Zonder et al. reported an
ORR of 30% for a combination with carfilzomib in 72
patients with at least 2 prior regimens with BTZ and
IMiD. The most common hematologic toxicities included
anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia [65].
Selinexor (SINE inhibitor)
Selinexor (KPT-330) is a novel member of the
selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) class of
compounds. KPT-330 has significant activity against
hematological malignancies, especially those that are
refractory to standard chemotherapeutic agents [66]. In a
phase I dose escalation study (NCT01607892) conducted
by Chen et al., 40% showed minimal response, 6.7%
partial response and 33% had stable disease among the
17 heavily pretreated relapsed or refractory MM patients.
The most common side effects were anorexia, nausea,
10755

Oncotarget

vomiting, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.
These side effects were well managed with supportive
care [67]. A phase I study of selinexor combined with
carfilzomib and dexamethasone to evaluate both efficacy
and tolerance is currently underway (NCT02199665)
[68, 69]. The early results show a 75% PR without any
unexpected toxicities in those refractory to carfilzomib,
suggesting that this regimen overcomes carfilzomib
resistance [70]. Also phase 1/2 clinical trials in
combination with dexamethasone, liposomal doxorubicin,
pomalidomide/dexamethasone, or PIs/dexamethasone are
ongoing, with promising interim results (NCT02336815,
NCT02186834, or NCT02199665, respectively) [71].
In conclusion, 2015 has been an exciting year for
relapsed/refractory MM, with three drugs approved
by U.S. FDA - namely ixazomib, elotuzumab and
daratumumab. The first two drugs were approved for use
with dexamethasone and lenalidomide in patients with one
prior line of therapy. Therefore, now we have three options
in the patients with one to three prior lines of treatment.
Data have been reported on carfilzomib being combined
with lenalidomide/dexamethasone and on ixazomib
and elotuzumab being combined with lenalidomide/
dexamethasone. On the other hand, daratumumab was
approved for use as a single agent for patients with double
refractory disease or those who have had more than three
lines of therapy.
It is difficult to predict which of these drugs will
be a frontrunner in the future therapy of MM. The choice
of optimal combination therapy can be made only after
giving due consideration to various factors. These factors
include (1) treatment-related factors: sensitivity and
tolerability to prior treatments; (2) disease-related factors:
disease presentation and cytogenetics; and (3) patientrelated factors: age, organ failure and comorbidities. Headto-head comparisons are required to explore the efficacy
of these novel treatments in certain subgroups of patients.
Based on the current data, we suggest that carfilzomib and
ixazomib combinations may be utilized for people who
require fairly rapid cytoreduction. Particular ixazomib
combinations may be utilized for older patients because
ixazomib is remarkably well tolerated, and elotuzumab
may be an option that is suitable for slow biochemical
relapses or patients who have other comorbidities because
of elotuzumab’s fairly decent safety profile. Daratumumab
is a good choice for heavily treated or late relapse patients.
Based on daratumumab’s single-agent activity, it is also
being brought early into the clinical setting.
Several trials are in progress with the goal of further
improvement in clinical outcomes for our patients with
MM. Thus, we believe that we are at the verge of another
paradigm shift in the management of MM.
