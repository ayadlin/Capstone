Abstract
The transmembrane cell adhesion protein ADAM9 has been implicated in cancer cell migration and lung
cancer metastasis to the brain, but the underpinning mechanisms are unclear and clinical support has been
lacking. Here, we demonstrate that ADAM9 enhances the ability of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to cleave
and stimulate the function of the promigratory protein CDCP1 to promote lung metastasis. Blocking this
mechanism of cancer cell migration prolonged survival in tumor-bearing mice and cooperated with dexamethasone and dasatinib (a dual Src/Abl kinase inhibitor) treatment to enhance cytotoxic treatment. In clinical
specimens, high levels of ADAM9 and CDCP1 correlated with poor prognosis and high risk of mortality in patients
with lung cancer. Moreover, ADAM9 levels in brain metastases derived from lung tumors were relatively higher
than the levels observed in primary lung tumors. Our results show how ADAM9 regulates lung cancer metastasis
to the brain by facilitating the tPA-mediated cleavage of CDCP1, with potential implications to target this network
as a strategy to prevent or treat brain metastatic disease. Cancer Res; 74(18); 5229–43. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide among both men and women, with 159,480 deaths
estimated for 2013 in the United States (1). Brain metastases
from lung are found in 20% to 50% of patients with non–small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and cause the patients a worse

prognosis (2). Lung cancer accounts for the majority of brain
metastases. In contrast to metastases from other primary
cancer sites such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and
melanoma that can develop over 1 year after diagnosis, brain
metastases from lung cancer can occur within months after or
even at the time of diagnosis of the primary (3).
Once cancer cells intravasate from the primary site into the
blood and before extravasation and colonization in the distant
organ, the ﬁrst step for cancer cells to complete the process of
metastasis is their adhesion to vascular endothelial cells (4).
Several genes related to lung cancer metastatic to the brain
that play a role in cancer cells' adhesion to brain endothelial
cells include N-cadherin, integrin, and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 9 (ADAM9; refs. 5 and 6). ADAM9 belongs
to the ADAM family of type I transmembrane proteins, which
are involved in several biologic processes, including neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and cell adhesion and migration (7). The
disintegrin domain of ADAM9 adheres to cells by binding to
integrins (8) or heparin sulfate proteoglycans (9), and the
metalloproteinase domain functions in ectodomain shedding
to release a variety of cell-surface proteins, including growth
factors, cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, and receptors (10).
Overexpression of ADAM9 has been consistently observed
in pancreatic, breast, and prostate cancers (11–13). Using an
artiﬁcial overexpression system, investigators showed that
ectopic expression of ADAM9 in lung cancer cells correlated
with metastases to the brain through the regulation of
integrin a3 and b1 (6). To further understand the mechanisms by which ADAM9 promotes lung cancer metastatic to
the brain in addition to ADAM9's role in cancer cells'
adhesion to brain endothelial cells, we analyzed the differential gene expression between control cells and ADAM9

knockdown lung cancer cells metastatic to the brain and
investigated the ADAM9-related pathways required for lung
cancer metastasis to the brain. We also analyzed tissue
samples from lung adenocarcinoma patients to investigate
the clinical relevance of ADAM9.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and animal model
Human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines CL1-0 (low invasiveness) and F4 (high invasiveness) from the same lung cancer
origin (14) and F4-luc cells with stable expression of high levels
of luciferase were established as previously described (15).
Experiments were carried out within 6 months of acquiring the
cells from the established cell bank to ensure that cells maintained their ability to form lung cancer tumors in SCID mice.
All cell lines were tested to be free of mycoplasma and
authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR) DNA typing
(Genelabs Life Science) in November 2013. To generate cell
lines of lung cancer metastatic to the brain, parental F4-luc
cells (5  104 cells) were injected intracardially into 8-week-old
SCID mice (n ¼ 5; BioLASCO) and imaged weekly by in vivo
imaging system (IVIS) spectrum imaging system (Xenogen) for
1 month under SPF condition. When brain metastases were
detected by IVIS, the whole brain was dissected, minced,
treated with collagenase type IA (0.2 mg/mL; Sigma) for 1 hour,
and then washed and cultured in DME/F12 plus 10% FBS
media to get clones of the lung cancer cells metastatic to the
brain such as Bm2 and Bm7. Bm7 cells were injected intracardially into SCID mice again, and the same process was
repeated to verify the cells' ability to metastasize to the brain.
Bm7brm cells were obtained from the second cycle (Fig. 1A).
To avoid increasing the risk of genetic mutation during the
prolonged period in which cells were generated, Bm7 cells were
used as brain-metastatic cells in this study. All animal experiments were carried out under protocols approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of China Medical University and Hospital.
Microarray processing and survival analyses
Three public microarray datasets were analyzed: two were
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (16), including GSE8894 (61 patients in South Korea, two patients with
adenocarcinoma were excluded because age was unavailable;
ref. 17) and GSE11969 (90 patients in Japan; ref. 18), and the
third dataset, composed entirely of lung adenocarcinoma
patients, was obtained from the Shedden and colleagues study
(469 patients in the United States; ref. 19). For our analysis, only
patients with lung adenocarcinoma from each of the datasets
were examined. We expanded the number of patient for the
survival curve analysis by combining the GSE8894 and
GSE11969 datasets (referred to as Asia datasets). After retrieving the raw data, a quantile normalization method was performed for each dataset to remove the potential systematic
biases. Survival analyses were performed based on the procedures in our previous studies (20, 21). Brieﬂy, for each gene,
samples were divided into two groups according to the following criteria: (i) a high group, in which gene expression levels

5230

Cancer Res; 74(18) September 15, 2014

of the speciﬁc gene were higher than the median in all
samples; and (ii) a low group, in which gene expression levels
of the speciﬁc gene were lower than the median in all
samples. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were used to assess
the differences between these two groups. Finally, a Cox
hazard regression model was used to evaluate the quantitative risk of the gene expression grouping in patients with
lung adenocarcinoma.
Immunohistochemistry staining
The primary and metastatic specimens were obtained from
the ﬁles of the Department of Pathology of China Medical
University Hospital in compliance with protocols approved by
the CMUH IRB (DMR99-IRB-131). Group I (n ¼ 18), primary
lung tumor from patient with early-stage disease without
relapse for more than 4 years; group II (n ¼ 24), primary lung
tumor from patients with early-stage disease that relapsed in 1
to 3 years; group III (n ¼ 21), primary lung tumor from patients
with late-stage disease metastatic to brain or bone at diagnosis;
group IV (n ¼ 21), paired lung tumor metastatic to brain or
bone from patients in group III. Asian lung cancer tissue array
was purchased from US Biomax (LC1006). ADAM9, CDCP1,
and tPA expression in clinical specimens from patients with
lung cancer were detected by immunohistochemical staining
as previously described (15). Brieﬂy, goat anti-mouse ADAM9
antibody (AF949; Abcam; ref. 13), goat anti-human CDCP1
antibody (AB1377; Abcam), and rabbit anti-human tPA (sc5241; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used to perform IHC
staining using horseradish peroxidase–conjugated avidin–biotin complex (ABC) from the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector
Laboratories) and AEC chromogen (Vector Laboratories). The
sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted.
All stainings were evaluated by experienced histologists.

Results
ADAM9 expression is associated with lung cancer
metastasis to the brain
In a series of established human lung cancer cell sublines
metastatic to the brain (see Materials and Methods; left, Fig.
1A), ADAM9 protein expression in sublines Bm7 and Bm7brm
was higher than ADAM9 expression in the low metastatic
CL1-0 and high metastatic F4 cells (Fig. 1A, right). The Bm7
cells showed stronger metastatic ability in vitro and were more
drug resistant than the F4-luc parental cells were (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B), a ﬁnding consistent with clinical
observations in patients with lung cancer with brain metastases (22). Furthermore, Bm7 cells maintained the luciferase
activity of the original F4-luc cells for establishing an animal
model of lung cancer metastatic to the brain (Supplementary
Fig. S1C).
We generated two Bm7 ADAM9 knockdown cell lines (shADAM9-C and shADAM9-E) by lentivirus expressing shRNAs
targeting different regions of ADAM9. The expression of
ADAM9 was more strongly inhibited in shADAM9-E than in
shADAM9-C cells (Fig. 1B, top). Bm7 cells with ADAM9 knockdown (Bm7-shADAM9-C and Bm7-shADAM9-E) had a significantly weaker migration rate than shGFP control cells had
(Fig. 1B, bottom) but had a similar proliferation rate to controls

within 2 days (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Results from the in
vitro blood–brain barrier assay indicated that there were more
trans-migrated cells in Bm7 than in CL1-0 or F4 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1E) but the increase in trans-migrated cells was
attenuated in Bm7 ADAM9 knockdown cells (Fig. 1C). However, adhesion of control and ADAM9 knockdown Bm7 cells to
human brain endothelial cells (HBMEC) was not altered (Fig.
1D). Although these data indicated that adhesion to HBMEC
required more than ADAM9 alone, all lung cancer cells metastatic to the brain demonstrated stronger adhesion than
parental F4-luc did, further validating that lung cancer cells
metastatic to the brain have a high ability to adhere to brain
endothelial cells.
To study the metastatic effect of ADAM9 in vivo, control and
Bm7-shADAM9 cells were introduced by intracardiac injection
into SCID mice and monitored for brain metastasis, as this
approach has been previously established for a preclinical
metastasis model for studying metastasis to brain or bone
(23). Twenty days after injection, mice that received Bm7shADAM9 cells had lower ability of lung cancer cells to
metastasize to brain and/or bone than did mice in the control
(Bm7-shGFP) group, as indicated by the loss of luciferase
signals under IVIS imaging. In the Bm7-shGFP group, all mice
developed tumor metastasis to brain, bone, and lung whereas
metastasis developed in 80% and 25% of mice in the Bm7shADAM9-C and Bm7-shADAM9-E groups, respectively (Fig.
1E). Furthermore, histologic examination of brain sections
conﬁrmed tumor formation in the brains of mice in the
Bm7-shGFP group (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these data indicate that cells with higher levels of ADAM9 are also more
metastatic and that depletion of ADAM9 signiﬁcantly reduces
cancer metastasis.
ADAM9 enhances CDCP1 expression and activation
Although ectopic expression of ADAM9 in lung cancer cells
was reported to correlate with brain metastasis through upregulation of integrin a3 and b1 (6), Bm7-shADAM9 cells did not
signiﬁcantly suppress surface integrin b1 compared with suppression in parental or control cells when we detected total,
active, and inactive integrin b1, except for CL1-0 cells, which
have low integrin b1 expression (Supplementary Fig. S2). These
ﬁndings support our previous results showing that Bm7-shADAM9 cells did not affect cell adhesion (Fig. 1D). To investigate
how ADAM9 affects lung cancer metastatic to the brain and to
determine which genes are regulated by ADAM9 to promote
metastasis, we analyzed differential gene transcription proﬁle
by comparing the control cells and ADAM9 knockdown cells in
2 cell sublines of lung cancer metastatic to brain, Bm2 and
Bm7, as well as comparing Bm2 and Bm7 with parental F4-luc
cells. Genes with more than 2-fold change were considered as
likely to be involved in the ADAM9-associated lung cancer
metastatic to the brain. A total of 182 differentially expressed
genes identiﬁed by comparing control with ADAM9 knockdown and brain-metastatic cell sublines with parental cells
(Supplementary Table S1) was used in hierarchical clustering
analysis (Fig. 2A). Using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis network generation algorithm to determine highly interconnected
pathways representing fundamental biologic functions, we

5232

Cancer Res; 74(18) September 15, 2014

noticed that ADAM9 and CUB-domain–containing protein 1
(CDCP1) were shown in one interaction network involved in
cellular movement (Fig. 2B). The protein levels of ADAM9 and
total CDCP1 (both full-length and cleavage) were increased in
cells from low-metastatic (CL1-0) to high-metastatic cell lines
(Fig. 2C). Notably, the cleaved CDCP1 was higher in the brain
metastatic cells (Bm7) than in the F4 cells. We observed similar
results (higher cleaved CDCP1) in the brain metastatic cell
subline MDA-MB-231-brm (24) than in the parental MDA-MB231 breast cancer cell line (Fig. 2C). To further determine
whether the metalloproteinase activity of ADAM9 proteins
affects the expression level of CDCP1, we treated lung cancer
Bm7 cells with a broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor
BB-94. ADAM9 expression was suppressed under BB-94 treatment (Fig. 2D). In addition, the levels of full-length CDCP1
proteins were strongly decreased at 160 mmol/L BB-94 treatment whereas the levels of cleaved CDCP1 were slightly
decreased (Fig. 2D). CDCP1 expression was slightly decreased
in A549 cells treated with BB-94 (Fig. 2E). These results suggest
that the metalloproteinase activity of ADAM9 mainly affects
the expression of full-length CDCP1 but not of CDCP1 cleavage
as the latter may be regulated by other factors.
CDCP1 is a transmembrane protein involved in cell–cell
interaction and has been shown to function as a regulator of
anoikis resistance (which bypasses apoptosis induced by
anchorage-dependent cells detaching from the surrounding
extracellular matrix) in lung adenocarcinomas (25). CDCP1 is
overexpressed in leukemia, metastatic colon cancer, and breast
cancer (26). De novo expression of CDCP1 in HeLa cells
dramatically increased their potential to colonize lungs, brain,
and ovaries in vivo (27). However, the molecules that regulate
CDCP1 expression and activation have not yet been fully
identiﬁed. To further demonstrate that ADAM9 regulates
CDCP1 expression, 293 cells with high transfection efﬁciency
and low ADAM9 expression were used to overexpress ADAM9.
Ectopic expression of ADAM9 in 293 cells increased the fulllength CDCP1 but not the cleaved form; transient transfection
of ADAM9 in Bm7 cells increased the full-length and cleaved
CDCP1 proteins (Fig. 3A), suggesting ADAM9 increases the
level of full-length CDCP1 but does not directly affect the level
of CDCP1 cleavage. The full-length CDCP1 ranges from 130 to
140 kDa, which is larger than calculated size of 90 kDa because
of extensive glycosylation and is cleaved by a serine protease,
for example, matriptase, plasmin, or trypsin (28, 29), through
an unclear mechanism to generate a 70-kDa C-terminal fragment. Proteolysis of CDCP1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation
of its C-terminal 70-kDa fragment and recruitment of Src and
PKCd to initiate signaling pathways (30). In Bm7-shGFP cells, 2
forms of CDCP1 proteins were detected, and the levels of the
cleaved form were lower in Bm7-shADAM9-E cells (Fig. 3B).
The levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated-CDCP1-interacting signaling molecules (phospho-Src and phospho-PKCd) were also
decreased in Bm7-shADAM9-E cells but only slightly affected
in Bm7-shADAM9-C cells; that difference was associated with
ADAM9 expression (Fig. 3B). To further determine whether
ADAM9-enhanced CDCP1-interacting signaling molecules was
because of the more stable cleaved CDCP1 rather than to the
full-length CDCP1, the degradation rate of two forms of CDCP1

ADAM9 Promotes Lung Cancer Metastases to Brain

was determined. Under cycloheximide treatment to block
protein neosynthesis, the levels of full-length CDCP1 decreased
after 6 hours whereas the levels of cleaved CDCP1 remained
high for 24 hours in control cells. The calculated degradation
rate of full-length CDCP1 was 2.9% per hour whereas almost no
degradation of the cleaved form was observed, indicating that
cleaved CDCP1 is more stable than the full-length form (Fig.
3C). Thus, ADAM9 likely enhances the CDCP1 signaling as
more cleaved CDCP1 is present in the control cells.

Both forms of CDCP1 were tyrosine phosphorylated, an
event required to overcome anoikis (25), and no difference
between the phospho-CDCP1 signal and total CDCP1 proteins
in control or shADAM9-E cells was observed, suggesting that
both forms (full-length and cleavage) of CDCP1 are functionally active (Fig. 3D). To determine whether suppression of
CDCP1 cleavage and CDCP1-interacting signaling molecules in
ADAM9 knockdown cells inﬂuences the function of CDCP1 in
anoikis resistance, we performed a soft agar assay and found

that ADAM9 knockdown cells formed lower number of colonies than did the parental or control cells (Fig. 3E). In addition,
the number of apoptotic cells was higher in the Bm7-shADAM9-E than in the control group in an anchorage-free culture
condition (Fig. 3F, top and Supplementary Fig. S3A).
To further investigate the function of the ADAM9–CDCP1
axis, we knocked down CDCP1 in Bm7 cells and found that the
levels of CDCP1-interacting signaling molecules were attenuated but not those of ADAM9 (Supplementary Fig. S3B). A
similar trend of increasing number of apoptotic cells in an
anchorage-free culture condition was observed in CDCP1
knockdown cells (Fig. 3F, bottom, and Supplementary Fig.
S3A and S3C), consistent with the known function of CDCP1
in anoikis resistance. Ectopic expression of CDCP1 in Bm7shADAM9-E cells rescued the cells' migration ability to a level
comparable to that of Bm7-shGFP (Fig. 3G). Thus, ADAM9
increases CDCP1 expression and the function of CDCP1 in
anoikis resistance and metastasis.
ADAM9 enhances CDCP1 cleavage through tPA
activation
Several proteases, including matriptase and plasmin, have
been shown to cleave CDCP1. Tissue plasminogen activator
(tPA), a serine protease responsible for the degradation of
blood clots by cleaving plasminogen to become plasmin, is
necessary and sufﬁcient to induce opening of the BBB that
causes BBB breakdown in a plasmin-dependent or plasminindependent manner (31, 32). No matriptase protein in Bm7
cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A) and a near background level of
plasminogen RNA from transcriptome analysis in lung cancer
cells were detected. Notably, from the transcriptome analysis
list (Supplementary Table S1), high tPA (PLAT) expression and
low plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1, SERPINE1)
expression were observed in cancer cells metastatic to the
brain (Fig. 2A). We further investigated whether ADAM9regulated CDCP1 cleavage requires tPA activation by examining both tPA and PAI-1 expression. Because of the ADAM9
levels in Bm7-shADAM9-C and -E remained high in the pooled
population, we selected the stable clones with low ADAM9
expression for further experiments. The reduced levels of
ADAM9 level in ADAM9 knockdown cells substantially
decreased expression of full-length and cleaved CDCP1 (Fig.
4B). In addition, the mRNA and protein levels were lower for
tPA and higher for PAI-1 in ADAM9 knockdown stable clones
than in the control cells (Fig. 4A and B). The catalytic activity of
tPA for plasminogen to plasmin conversion was also suppressed in ADAM9 knockdown cells (Fig. 4C).
To investigate whether the activity of tPA correlates with
ADAM9-regulated CDCP1 cleavage, tPA and PAI-1 knockdown
cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B) were used to investigate the
correlation of CDCP1 cleavage with tPA activity. We measured

the ratio of cleaved CDCP1 over the full-length CDCP1 and
found that CDCP1 cleavage was attenuated in tPA knockdown
but increased in PAI-1 knockdown cells compared with control
cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C). The activity of secreted tPA in
the cultured media of these cells for plasminogen to plasmin
conversion was measured (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig.
S4D), and further analysis showed a high correlation between
tPA activity and the ratio of CDCP1 cleavage to full-length
CDCP1 (R ¼ 0.89) among these cancer cells (Fig. 4D). The
percentage of apoptotic cells in an anchorage-free culture
condition was increased in tPA knockdown cells over the
percentage in the control cells (Fig. 4E and Supplementary
Fig. S3A), which is consistent with our observation in ADAM9
and CDCP1 knockdown cells and indicates that tPA plays a role
in anoikis resistance.
To test whether tPA addition could enhance CDCP1 cleavage, Bm7-shADAM9-E cells were treated with recombinant tPA
proteins. In 10% serum culture media, cleaved CDCP1 was
slightly increased at a higher dose of tPA treatment. Interestingly, CDCP1 cleavage in Bm7-shADAM9-E cells treated with
100 nmol/L tPA was also enhanced to a level comparable with
that in the control under serum-free conditions (Fig. 4F); this
ﬁnding indicated that CDCP1 is likely a substrate of tPA.
Next, to investigate whether tPA directly cleaves CDCP1,
full-length CDCP1 was isolated and treated with tPA and then
analyzed by Western blotting. Plasmin and trypsin, which are
known to cleave CDCP1, were included as the control. The
conversion of full-length to cleaved CDCP1 was increased in a
dose-dependent manner with tPA treatment similar to plasmin and trypsin treatment, indicating that tPA can directly
cleave CDCP1, albeit at a high concentration (Fig. 4G). These
results suggest that tPA activation mediates ADAM9-enhanced
CDCP1 cleavage.
Blocking the ADAM9–CDCP1–tPA axis in lung cancer
cells prolongs animal survival time
Next, we detected the migration rate of Bm7 cells by
silencing genes at the ADAM9–CDCP1–tPA axis. We showed
that control cells migrated farther and in a wider range of
direction than Bm7-shADAM9, Bm7-shCDCP1, and Bm7shtPA cells did, whereas Bm7-shPAI-1 rescued the migration
ability (Fig. 5A, top). Quantitation of cellular movement conﬁrmed that the loss of gene expression at ADAM9–CDCP1–tPA
axis signiﬁcantly inhibited cell migration (Fig. 5A, bottom).
These cells were further investigated for their metastatic ability
in animal models by intracardiac injection in mice. Kaplan–
Meier analysis indicated that mice inoculated with Bm7-shADAM9 and Bm7-shtPA cells had a signiﬁcantly longer overall
survival than did mice inoculated with the control cells.
Notably, mice in the Bm7-shCDCP1 group had only moderately
prolonged survival, but mice in the Bm7-shtPA group had the

longest survival time (Fig. 5B). When these cells were cultured
in anchorage-free conditions, the sub-G1 percentage, which
measures the apoptotic cell population, was higher in the Bm7shtPA, moderately higher in the Bm7-shADAM9, and slightly
higher in the Bm7-shCDCP1 cells than in the control cells in
anchorage-free conditions (Fig. 5C). These results provide a
partial explanation for the longer survival time in the Bm7shtPA group.
Next, we examined whether targeting the ADAM9–CDCP1–
tPA axis could beneﬁt lung cancer treatment using clinically
available drugs such as dexamethasone and dasatinib. Dexamethasone has been reported to inhibit CDCP1 cleavage
through upregulation of PAI-1 (33). Dasatinib is a dual Src/
Abl kinase inhibitor that also targets several other kinases (34)
with potent antiproliferative activity against hematologic
malignancies and cancer cell metastasis (35). We found that
dexamethasone enhanced PAI-1 expression in Bm7-shGFP
cells and enhanced PAI-1 expression even more strongly in
Bm7-shADAM9 cells and that dasatinib signiﬁcantly inhibited
the levels of pSFK and pPKCd in both cells (Fig. 5D). Moreover,
the 2-drug treatment combination acted synergistically in Bm7
cells and induced a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect (Fig. 5E,
top; CI < 1; Fig. 5E, bottom). These ﬁndings suggest that
blocking the ADAM9–CDCP1–tPA axis inhibits lung cancer
cell growth and metastasis.
Overexpression of ADAM9 and CDCP1 in primary lung
adenocarcinoma is associated with a poor prognosis
From above, we demonstrated that ADAM9 enhances
CDCP1 activation through tPA for anchorage-free survival of
cancer cells. This ﬁnding raises the question of whether
activation of the ADAM9–CDCP1 axis in patients with lung
adenocarcinoma has clinical relevance owing to its association
with poor prognosis. In the Asia datasets, patients with high
ADAM9 (ADAM9High) expression had signiﬁcantly shorter
survival times than did patients with low ADAM9 (ADAM9Low)
expression (P ¼ 0.0008). Similar results were observed in
patients with high CDCP1 (CDCP1High) expression, who also
had signiﬁcantly shorter survival times than did those with low
CDCP1 (CDCP1Low) expression (P ¼ 0.015; Fig. 6A, top).
Conversely, in the Western datasets (Shedden), ADAM9 expression level in patients did not correlate with patient prognosis
(P ¼ 0.174), whereas patients with CDCP1High expression had
signiﬁcantly shorter survival times than did those with
CDCP1Low expression (P ¼ 0.0002; Fig. 6A, bottom). However,
when we combined ADAM9 and CDCP1 as a predictor, patients
with ADAM9High/CDCP1High expression had a signiﬁcantly
worse prognosis than did patients with ADAM9Low/CDCP1Low
in the Asia and Western datasets (Fig. 6A).
Cox hazard regression model analysis also showed that
patients with ADAM9High/CDCP1High expression have a signif-

icantly higher risk of lung cancer mortality than do patients
with ADAM9Low/CDCP1Low expression in both the Asia
and Western datasets (hazard ratios of 5.97 and 1.80,
respectively; Fig. 6B). To rule out statistical bias as the reason
for these ﬁndings, we compared the predictability of ADAM9
versus CDCP1, and selected the more predictive of these two
genes; the selected gene in random combination with one of
other genes was then used to generate a proﬁle that illustrates
the predictability for the different pairs of genes. This gene
predictability proﬁle indicated that the predictor of ADAM9
plus CDCP1 ranked among the top 3.3% (GSE8894), 7.9%
(GSE11969), and 18.6% (Shedden datasets) of random combination (Fig. 6C). A number that is less than 20% indicated that
our ﬁnding in prognosis analysis is not from statistical bias;
thus, patients with lung adenocarcinoma with ADAM9High/
CDCP1High expression indeed had a higher risk of mortality
than those with ADAM9Low/CDCP1Low expression. Moreover,
Fisher exact test indicated that the percentage of patients with
high expression of tPA was signiﬁcantly higher (67%) in the
ADAM9High/CDCP1High group than those in the ADAM9Low/
CDCP1Low group in the Asia datasets (37%; Fig. 6D) and
Western (Fig. 6E) datasets (37%; P < 0.05). These results
support the clinical relevance of ADAM9High/CDCP1High in
patients via its association with poor prognosis and imply that
ADAM9High/CDCP1High expression in tumors is associated
with cancer metastasis.
High expression of ADAM9, CDCP1, and tPA in metastatic
lung adenocarcinoma
To assess the clinical relevance of ADAM9 protein expression in patients with lung cancer, we performed ADAM9
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining in a lung cancer tissue
array from the Asian patients. ADAM9 expression was high in
lung adenocarcinoma tissue but remained low expression in
matched adjacent normal lung tissue (P ¼ 0.012; Fig. 7A). Most
of the lung lesions metastatic to the brain had elevated ADAM9
mRNA expression compared with expression in bone metastatic lesions or normal lung tissues (P ¼ 0.01; Fig. 7B). To
evaluate whether activation of the ADAM9–CDCP1 axis contributes to lung cancer metastasis, we performed IHC staining
of 4 groups of clinical parafﬁn block tissue specimens from
lung adenocarcinoma patients at the China Medical University
Hospital (see Materials and Methods). Comparison of ADAM9
expression in these specimens showed that the rate of positive
ADAM9 detection increased almost 2-fold in groups II and III
(54% and 52%) and reached a 3-fold increase in group IV (81%)
compared with group I (28%; Fig. 7C). The rate of positive
CDCP1 detection remained high in all 4 groups (from 67% to
71%; Fig. 7C). The rate of positive tPA detection increased from
22% to 81% (Fig. 7C). The distribution of ADAM9 staining
signiﬁcantly correlated with the tPA staining results (P ¼

ADAM9 Promotes Lung Cancer Metastases to Brain

0.034; Fig. 7D). On comparing the IHC staining scores in paired
tumor specimens (primary and metastatic) from the same
patient, the trend toward higher ADAM9 expression in metastatic tumor tissue was signiﬁcantly increased only in patients
with brain metastasis (P ¼ 0.03) but not in patients with bone
metastasis (P ¼ 0.53; Fig. 7E). The trend was absent in CDCP1
or tPA staining in patients with metastasis to brain or bone
(Fig. 7E). By setting the IHC score 1þ as positive staining, the
triple-gene-positive (ADAM9–CDCP1–tPA positive staining)
detection rate was low in patients without metastasis (group
I) but increased in patients with metastasis (groups II and III)
and even reached 50% in tumor specimens metastatic to brain
or bone (group IV; Fig. 7F). In contrast, the triple-gene-negative
(ADAM9–CDCP1–tPA negative staining) detection rate
decreased from 22% in the nonmetastatic group to 5% in the
metastatic groups and even to zero in patients with tumor
metastatic to brain or bone. Taken together, these clinical
results indicate that activation of the ADAM9–CDCP1–tPA
axis contributes to lung cancer metastasis, especially to the
brain.

Discussion
Here, we address the potential implications of ADAM9 in
lung cancer metastatic to the brain and reveal a novel connection between ADAM9 and CDCP1 by which ADAM9
increases the cleavage form of CDCP1 through activation of
tPA by enhancing tPA and suppressing PAI-1 expression. The
contribution of the ADAM9–CDCP1–tPA axis to lung cancer
metastasis was validated in the cell model, the animal model
and clinical samples. On the basis of our results, blocking this
axis in cancer cells is expected to provide a therapeutic beneﬁt,
as knockdown of each one of the genes in the axis reduced
cancer cell migration and prolonged survival time in mouse
tumor models. In addition, targeting tPA activity and tyrosinephosphorylated-CDCP1-interacting signaling molecules, phospho-Src with dexamethasone and dasatinib showed a synergistic cytotoxic effect in lung cancer cells.
Although several studies have focused on ADAM9 as a new
anticancer drug target (36), clinical evidence of ADAM9 expression in lung cancer is still lacking (6). Our analysis of 3 lung
cancer datasets and clinical samples suggested that ADAM9
alone is a good prognostic marker in the Asia datasets but not
in the U.S. datasets. However, the combination of ADAM9 and
CDCP1 appears to be a better prognostic marker for patient
outcome, implying these genes play important roles in cancer
metastasis. Such clinical evidence and results of our study do
not indicate that ADAM9 is related speciﬁcally to metastases to
the brain. Rather, they support that ADAM9 enhances the
ability of cancer cells to establish distant metastases such as to
the brain. By investigating the paired clinical tumor specimens
from the tumor's primary site and distant site, albeit in limited
samples, we found that ADAM9 protein expression was signiﬁcantly higher in lung tumor tissue metastatic to the brain
than in the primary lung tumor but was not higher in lung
tumor tissue metastatic to bone. Although high levels of
ADAM9 in cancer cells are essential for metastasis to the
brain, these levels may not be speciﬁc to or only limited to

the brain. In addition, enhanced transmigration of the BBB by
cancer cells seems to be a result of the enhanced expression of
ADAM9 that triggers the activity of tPA.
The catalytic unit of tPA is known to function autonomously
(37), and there is no report showing ADAM9 cleaves tPA.
Although we did not provide sufﬁcient evidence to demonstrate the role of ADAM9 protease activity in regulating the
CDCP1–tPA axis, knocking down ADAM9 not only downregulated the transcription of tPA but also enhanced transcription of PAI-1, which suppressed the catalytic activity of tPA for
plasminogen conversion to plasmin (Fig. 4C). This suggests
that ADAM9 indirectly regulates the tPA activity.
The mechanism by which ADAM9 increases the expression of CDCP1 is still unclear. Heparin-binding EGF-like
growth factor (HB-EGF), a member of EGF family, is overexpressed and associated with carcinogenesis in hepatoma
and pancreatic cancer (38, 39). The transmembrane domain
of HB-EGF (pro-HB-EGF) can be cleaved by metalloproteases such as ADAM9, yielding a secreted form that activates EGFR (40). Activation of EGFR signaling has been
reported to upregulate CDCP1 mRNA and protein expression (41). Interestingly, we also observed increased mRNA
levels of HB-EGF in the brain-metastatic Bm7 cells compared with parental cells. Therefore, it is plausible that
ADAM9 increases the expression of CDCP1 via ADAM9dependent shedding of HB-EGF, leading to EGFR activation
and subsequent upregulation of CDCP1 protein and mRNA
expression. In addition, EGF has also been reported to
increase tPA mRNA in HeLa cells (42) and enhance PAI-1
transcription via sequential activation of c-Src and PKCd in
glioma cells (43). However, we observed downregulation of
tPA and upregulation of PAI-1 in ADAM9 knockdown cells,
suggesting other molecules besides EGF are involved in their
regulation. PAI-1 transcription can be regulated by many
transcription factors such as hypoxia-inducible factor-1a
(HIF-1a) and early growth response protein 1 (EGR1).
Although EGR1 is quickly activated under hypoxia, it can
induce transcription and expression of PAI-1 independently
of HIF-1a in murine macrophages (44). From the transcriptome analysis (Supplementary Table S1), we notice that
EGR1 mRNA levels were 10-fold higher in ADAM9 knockdown cells than in control cells, suggesting that ADAM9 may
inﬂuence expression of PAI-1 through activation of EGR1,
although more studies will be required to validate this.
The biologic behavior and function of PAI-1 seems paradoxical. PAI-1 is thought to inhibit activation of tPA or uPA,
an event that correlates with poor clinical outcomes in
cancer (45, 46); however, PAI-1 also serves as an indicator
of poor prognosis in breast cancer (47). These ﬁndings may
be attributed to differences in cell types and experimental
models. Our data indicate that PAI-1 knockdown increases
tPA activity, which results in more CDCP1 cleavage and cell
migration ability, implying that PAI-1 inhibits lung cancer
metastasis. More studies are warranted to clarify the role of
PAI-1 in metastasis.
Here, our ﬁndings indicate that ADAM9 regulates a complicated network in lung cancer metastatic to the brain
through tPA-mediated CDCP1 cleavage, especially in Asian
