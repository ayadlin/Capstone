Abstract
Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is an innovative local-regional therapy that involves delivery of intense electrical
pulses to tissue to induce nanoscale cell membrane defects for tissue ablation. The purpose of this study was to
investigate the feasibility of using IRE as a liver-directed ablation technique for the treatment of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). In the N1-S1 rodent model, hepatomas were grown in 30 Sprague-Dawley rats that were divided
into treatment and control groups. For treatment groups, IRE electrodes were inserted and eight 100-μs 2,500-V
pulses were applied to ablate the targeted tumor tissues. For both groups, magnetic resonance imaging scans were
performed at baseline and 15-day follow-up intervals to determine tumor sizes (one-dimensional maximum diameter, Dmax; estimated two-dimensional cross-sectional area, Cmax) as a tactic to assess longitudinal outcomes. Additional groups of treated animals were sacrificed at 1-, 3-, and 7-day intervals posttherapy for pathology assessment
of treatment response. Magnetic resonance images showed significant tumor size reductions within 15 days posttherapy (32 ± 31% Dmax and 52 ± 39% Cmax decreases compared with 110 ± 35% Dmax and 286 ± 125% Cmax increases
for untreated tumors). Pathology correlation studies documented progression from poorly differentiated viable
HCC tissues before treatment to extensive tumor necrosis and full regression in 9 of 10 treated rats 7 to 15 days
after treatment. Our findings suggest that IRE can be an effective strategy for targeted ablation of liver tumors,
prompting its further evaluation for HCC therapy. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1555–63. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and the third most common cause
of cancer death (1, 2). Resection, liver transplantation, and
percutaneous ablation treatments are three potentially curative therapies for early-stage HCC; effective utilization of
these therapies is increasing as a result of widely implemented surveillance programs in at-risk patient populations (3).
However, most patients are not candidates for resection or
transplantation due to advanced disease stages and/or donor
shortages (4).
According to the guidelines of the American Association
for the Study of Liver Diseases, percutaneous ablation is
the best treatment option for nonsurgical patients with earAuthors' Affiliations: 1 Department of Radiology, Northwestern

ly-stage HCC (5). These ablation techniques include percutaneous ethanol injection (6), percutaneous acetic acid
injection (7), radiofrequency ablation (8, 9), microwave coagulation therapy (10), laser interstitial thermal ablation (11),
and cryoablation therapy (12). Percutaneous ethanol injection is the most well-known and widely studied approach;
it can offer a safe, effective, and inexpensive treatment for
small HCC, achieving tumor necrosis rates of 90% to 100%
for HCC smaller than 2 cm. However, for HCC between 3
and 5 cm, this rate drops to 50% (13), and the local tumor
recurrence rate is up to 17% when treating HCC ≥5 cm
(14). Radiofrequency ablation is the most widely used thermoablation technique providing improved local disease control compared with percutaneous ethanol injection in both
small and larger HCC (5, 15). However, radiofrequency
ablation has significant potential limitations, including local
tumor progression and a higher rate of adverse events (intraperitoneal bleeding, tumor seeding, hepatic abscess, bile duct
injury, and hepatic decompensation; refs. 16–18). Furthermore, depending on the location of the targeted tumor,
radiofrequency ablation may be contraindicated due to the
potential damage to adjacent tissues and blood vessels
(19). Therefore, the development of a more effective HCC ablation technique is warranted to achieve superior tumor necrosis rates while reducing the likelihood of adverse events.

ablation technique in 2005 (20). IRE involves targeted delivery of short (microsecond to millisecond duration) intense
electrical pulses to induce cell death through permanent cell
membrane defects. These pulses elevate the trans-membrane
potential to an extent that causes permanent defects within
the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane for those tissues
contained with the targeted treatment region. These pulses
are applied through electrodes positioned within the targeted
tissues. Previous animal model studies have shown that IRE
can ablate substantial volumes of tissue. IRE has the potential to serve as an independent new modality for targeted tissue ablation that is based on the application of strong
electrical fields rather than the deposition of heat or chemical agents (21–23). Rigorous preclinical studies in human
HCC cells (HepG2; ref. 24), normal liver (25), and prostate
tissues (26), as well as cutaneous tumor models (22), have
each shown the feasibility of using IRE as a new ablation option with negligible thermal side effects (27).
The purpose of our current study was to investigate the
efficacy of IRE approaches for targeted ablation of HCC.
We tested the hypothesis that IRE procedures would lead
to tumor necrosis in a transplanted rodent hepatoma model.
We provide serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and follow-up histopathologic evidence, showing the potential longitudinal efficacy of IRE for the treatment of HCC.

Materials and Methods
Tumor Cell Line and Culture
The N1-S1 rat hepatoma cell line (American Type Culture
Collection, CRL-1603) was obtained and cultured in DMEM
(ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (SigmaAldrich) and 90 μg/mL gentamicin. Cells were maintained in
suspension culture flasks at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. This cell line was initially established
from a HCC induced in a male Sprague-Dawley rat by ingestion of carcinogen 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (28). Before
each implantation procedure, the viability of the cells was
tested with trypan blue staining (confirming >90% cell viability for each tumor implantation procedure).
Animal Model
All studies were approved by our institutional animal care
and use committee and were performed in accordance with
institutional guidelines. Forty-four adult male SpragueDawley rats (Charles River Laboratories) weighing initially
301 to 325 g were used for these experiments. After anesthesia, a mini-laporatomy was performed and the left medial
lobe of the liver was exposed. N1-S1 rat hepatoma cells
(1 × 106) were visually injected under the hepatic capsule into
this lobe. Following initial implantation, ∼6 to 10 d were required for tumor induction and growth to desired pretreatment size (diameter <1.60 cm). Thirty rats from the initial
44 implanted animals produced hepatoma (1.29 ± 0.18 cm
diameter) suitable for subsequent IRE treatment procedures.
These rats were randomly divided into six groups: group 1,
six rats for an untreated baseline control group; group 2,
six rats for an untreated 15-d end-point control group;

1556

group 3, six rats for an IRE-treated 15-d end-point group
and four rats each for IRE-treated 1-d (group 4), 3-d (group 5),
and 7-d (group 6) end-point groups. IRE procedures were
performed shortly after baseline MRI measurements; these
MRI measurements were repeated at baseline and 15-d follow-up time intervals to measure tumor sizes (groups 2
and 3) with animals subsequently euthanized for histology
at different study end points for each group (1-, 3-, 7-, or
15-d intervals after original baseline scan).
IRE Procedures
IRE apparatus and dosing plan. A BTX Electroporator
(ECM830; Harvard apparatus) function generator and a parallel two-needle electrode array were used for all rat IRE
procedures. The electrode array was constructed using two
MR-compatible platinum-15% iridium needles (each 35 mm
in length with a diameter of 4 mm); these were inserted
through a plastic block to maintain a 1-cm spacing between
the two parallel needles. We elected to use an IRE ablation protocol that included the application of 2,500-V square wave
pulses, a total of eight pulses of 100-μs length with 100-ms
spacing between pulses (identical to the protocol used for
prior IRE studies in cutaneous tumor tissues; ref. 22). Before
in vivo IRE procedures, we used a commercial finite element
modeling (FEM) software package (COMSOL Multi-Physics,
version 3.3) to simulate the anticipated ablation zone based
on the above-described IRE protocol parameters, electrode
spacing, and anticipated lethal electrical field potential for hepatic tissues of 637 V/cm (29). Our simulation closely followed
those described in previous IRE studies solving the Laplace
equation to calculate induced electrical field potentials based
on anticipated tissue and electrode conductivities (20, 30).
Based on our chosen IRE parameters, the FEM simulations
suggested that we should anticipate ablation zones of
roughly 1.6 cm × 1.2 cm (Fig. 1B), sufficiently large for treatment of the induced N1-S1 tumors. Also, use of a short duration for application of the electrical pulses should lead to
negligible heating effects (relatively short 100-μs integration
interval for Arhennius relation describing anticipated thermal damage Ω = ∫ξ e−E/Rtdt, where ξ is the frequency factor,
E is the activation energy, and R is the universal gas constant; refs. 20, 27).
Tumor IRE procedure. Before both imaging and IRE procedures, rats were anesthetized with a high limb injection of
ketamine (75–100 mg/kg) and xylazine (2–6 mg/kg). After
baseline imaging for tumor confirmation, each rat was fixed
in a supine position within a restrain apparatus (rats strapped
to form-fitting back board). Next, a minilaparotomy incision
was performed to expose and visually locate the N1-S1 tumor
within the left hepatic lobe. Before electrode placement, the
tumor-bearing liver lobe was digitally palpated between
thumb and forefinger to approximate the configuration of
the tumor mass. For each animal, we positioned the bipolar
IRE electrode array such that the two-needle insertion positions (a) essentially straddled the centroid of the tumor mass
and (b) were aligned along the axis of the largest tumor dimension (for optimal treatment, tumor should be located
midway between the two parallel electrodes; Fig. 1). Finally,

the electrodes were connected to the electroporation function generator and IRE pulse train was applied (requiring
<1 s for application of the complete IRE pulse train). Following IRE procedure, the abdominal incisions were closed with
two-layer technique followed by topical application of antibiotic ointment and Metacam injection (1–2 mg/kg s.c.). Animals were returned to storage facilities for the duration of
the follow-up delay interval before end-point imaging studies.
During these follow-up delay intervals, each animal was observed daily to determine the presence of any postoperative
complications (incision infection or abscess formation); at
necropsy, each animal was inspected for additional procedural complications, including injuries to adjacent organs, tumor
seeding, and intraperitoneal bleeding.

MRI Measurements
MRI protocol. All MRI studies were performed using a 3-T
Magnetom Trio clinical scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions)
with custom-built rodent receiver coil (Chenguang Med.
Tech. Co.). Along both coronal and transverse orientations,
T2-weighted, T1-weighted, and proton density–weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) scans were performed with a multislice
acquisition providing complete coverage of the entire liver
volume (31). All scans were performed with a 150-mm
FOV, 2.0-mm slice thickness, three signal averages, 256 matrix (0.6 × 0.6 mm2 in-plane voxel size), repetition and echo
time (TR/TE) = 3,500/60 ms for T2-weighted scans, TR/TE =
300/8 ms for T1-weighted scan, and TR/TE = 3,500/8 ms for
proton density–weighted scan. These MRI measurements

were performed at baseline and at the end point of the study
for each respective animal.
Image analysis. Measurements were performed offline using the ImageJ software package.7 All coronal and axial orientation DICOM format T2-weighted TSE images collected for
each animal were reviewed according to Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and WHO criteria to (a)
measure the maximum lesion diameter (Dmax, along the orientation bearing the largest tumor diameter; ref. 32) and (b)
provide an estimate of the two-dimensional cross-sectional
area of the tumors at these same locations (Cmax, calculated
as the cross-product of the maximum lesion diameter Dmax
and largest diameter measured perpendicular to D max ;
ref. 33). These measurements were performed for both baseline and 15-d follow-up interval scans.
Histology
After follow-up MRI measurements, each rat was euthanized with i.v. injection of Euthasol at a dose of 150 mg/kg
and bilateral thoracotomy. Two to three sections across the
lesion were sampled and fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution;
these tissue sections were then embedded in paraffin for
H&E staining. Resulting histology slides were deidentified
(w.r.t. treatment group) and reviewed by an attending surgical pathologist with specialization in gastrointestinal oncology (>10 years experience). The percentage of viable tumor
tissue was separately evaluated for each animal.

Representative tissue sections from each group were selected for immunohistochemistry evaluation. CD34 staining
was used as a malignant tumor neovascularization marker
(34, 35) to highlight regions of sinusoidal capillarization; caspase-3 staining (previously shown during induction of hepatocyte apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo) was used as a
marker of active apoptosis (36, 37).
Statistical Analysis
All statistics were performed using the SPSS statistical
software package (SPSS, version 17). Lesion size increases
based on one-dimensional Dmax measurements and twodimensional Cmax measurements were compared between
group 2 and group 3 animals (comparison between untreated
and treated rats after 15-d follow-up interval) by nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. Test was considered statistically significant with a P value of <0.05.

Results
Thirty-two of 44 rats implanted with N1-S1 cells developed
hepatoma (73% tumor induction rate similar to previously
reported N1-S1 induction rates; ref. 38). One rat was euthanized before IRE procedures due to suture failure and wound
dehiscence, and one additional rat was excluded from the
study due to excessive tumor growth before IRE procedure
(detected during baseline MRI scan). No postoperative complications were observed in the IRE-treated rats (groups 3–6).

on our FEM simulations were well correlated to in vivo IRE
ablation zones observed within H&E pathology slides

postnecropsy (Fig. 1C). Within tumor animals, H&E staining
showed a clear progression from poorly differentiated viable
hepatoma tissue pretherapy, to heterogeneously viable tumor
tissues early post-IRE (1–3 days) and extensive tumor necrosis at delayed intervals (7–15 days) post-IRE treatment
(Fig. 2). A 95% viable hepatoma is shown from a representative baseline control animal in Fig. 2A. One day post-IRE, ablation zones showed mostly viable tumor and adjacent
necrotizing liver tissue (Fig. 2B). Three days post-IRE, ablation zones included both heterogeneously necrotizing tumor
and liver tissues (Fig. 2C). In the 7-day post-IRE treatment
animals (group 6), four of four treated lesions showed extensive necrotizing tissue debris, histocytes/lymphocytes
reaction, microcalcification, and no viable tumor tissue
(Fig. 2D). In the 15-day post-IRE treatment animals (group 3),

five of six treated lesions showed no remnant viable tumor
but showed giant cell reaction, hemosiderin-laden histocyte
reaction, and scaring fibrosis (Fig. 2E). One of these six treated lesions contained a volume of <5% viable tumor tissue,
compared with 68 ± 8% viable tumor tissue for the end-point
control animals (group 2) with 32 ± 8% central necrosis due
to tumor ischemia. Histologically determined tumor viability
characteristics (percentage of viable tumor tissue estimated
for each lesion at necropsy) for all animals in groups 1, 2, and
3 are shown in Fig. 4C.

and typically isointense within proton density–weighted
images. MRI images showed significant tumor size reductions
post-IRE (−32 ± 31%, Dmax decrease) for treated rats (group 3),
whereas all untreated tumors (group 2) increased in size
(+110 ± 35%, Dmax increase; Fig. 4D, left). Similarly, corresponding two-dimensional Cmax measurements also showed
significant decreases (−52 ± 39%) for treated rats (group 3),
whereas all untreated tumors (group 2) showed increases in
these two-dimensional size measurements (+286 ± 125%;
Fig. 4D, right). There was a statistically significant difference between both one-dimensional (D max ) and twodimensional (C max ) lesion size changes between these
two groups (P = 0.004 for both comparisons). Representative
T2-weighted baseline and follow-up MRI images from a
control rat and a 15-day post-IRE treatment rat are shown
in Fig. 4A and B, respectively. Corresponding H&E histology
slides for these rats showed mostly viable tumor tissue for the
end-point control rat but no remnant viable tumor in the
treated animal.
Immunohistochemistry. For immunohistochemistry
CD34 staining, diffuse sinusoidal CD34 reactivity was observed for untreated rat hepatoma (Fig. 5A); on the other
hand, 1-day post-IRE CD34 staining showed mild vascular dilation and congestion (Fig. 5B). Remnant vessel skeletons
with inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrotic tissue formation over a necrotic background was observed for 7- and
15-day post-IRE treatment lesions (Fig. 5C and D); limited
caspase-3 staining was shown in the untreated tumors (typically within central ischemic areas), whereas the most viable
tumor tissues showed no caspase-3 activation (Fig. 6A). Extensive caspase-3 activation was observed 1 day post-IRE

treatment (Fig. 6B). At a delayed post-IRE follow-up interval
(7–15 days post-IRE), caspase-3 was no longer visible within
the treated lesion over the necrotic background (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
These animal model studies showed the potential efficacy
of IRE as a targeted ablation technique for the treatment of
HCC. MR images showed a significant tumor size reduction
within 15 days posttherapy, and histology correlation studies
showed a clear progression from poorly differentiated viable
hepatoma tissue pretherapy to extensive tumor necrosis and
complete tumor regression in 9 of 10 treated rats 7 to 15 days
after treatment. Our study is the first to show the efficacy of
IRE for targeted treatment of liver tumors in a transplanted
rodent hepatoma model.
Relatively early post-IRE therapy (within 1 day posttreatment), we observed homogeneously necrotizing tissues within treated normal liver parenchyma with clear margins
between the treated and untreated tissues. However, we
observed somewhat different responses within N1-S1
tumor tissues; specifically, tumor tissues tended to exhibit
heterogeneously necrotic characteristics at the early intervals
(1–3 days) posttherapy with limited viable tumor trapped
within the necrotic tissues. Eventually, all treated tumors
progressed from these early-interval stages of partial necrosis
to essentially complete necrosis with fibrotic scar formations
7 to 15 days later. One potential explanation for these heterogeneous delays in cell death could be that some of the
treated tissues were destroyed due to the alternative me-

chanisms of ischemia and associated hypoxia (due to entrapment within surrounding necrotic tissue) as opposed to the
direct effect of IRE. Additional studies will be required to rigorously investigate the mechanism of these observed temporally dependent necrosis events associated with IRE ablation
procedures. For tumor tissues, although no significant
changes were observed on H&E and CD34 staining 1 day
posttherapy (group 4), we observed extensive caspase-3 activation that might indicate an alternative underlying cell
death mechanism (i.e., tumor cell apoptosis initiation) in addition to solely cell membrane permeabilization. Delayed interval results (15 days posttherapy) consistently showed the
longitudinal efficacy of this targeted IRE approach; MRI
scans depicted significant lesion size reductions for each
treated animal, whereas significant tumor growth occurred
for untreated animals. These imaging results were well correlated to delayed interval histopathologic results that
showed no viable tumor tissue within the lesion along with
inflammatory cell reaction, fibrotic scar formation, remnant
vascular skeleton CD34-positive staining (depicting system of
damaged blood vessel walls within the treated tissue region),
and an absence of caspase-3 activation.
Our study specifically showed the feasibility of using IRE as
a therapeutic modality for the treatment of HCC. All treated
tumors showed significant size reductions within 2 weeks
posttherapy and there were no adverse events (i.e., peritoneal
bleeding, tumor seeding, liver failure, or mortalities) observed
for any of the 18 treated animals. For the IRE protocol selected for our study, we used far fewer pulses than prior cutaneous tumor model studies (eight square wave pulses as
opposed to 80 pulses at 0.3Hz) while continuing to achieve
effective treatment response. Our study showed the feasibility of using IRE to ablate HCC; however, further studies to
optimize IRE parameters are certainly warranted.
The efficacy of conventional radiofrequency ablation approaches is often limited in larger tumors due to perfusionmediated cooling, which can limit thermally induced
coagulation necrosis (39). The extent of the treated tissue volume can be difficult to control due to blood circulation with
heat-sink effects, leading to indistinct margins between treated and untreated tissues and/or undertreatment of the targeted tissues (40). IRE results in a distinct margin between
ablated and viable tissues at the position where the magnitude
of the electrical field falls below a lethal dose threshold (23).
Importantly, IRE does not suffer from the heat-sink effect,
which is commonly problematic for thermal ablation methods
(21). Additional potential advantages for IRE methods include
tumor-specific immunologic reaction (41), little impact on the
collagen network within treated tissues, and the potential to
abate tumor tissues near large vessels (42). Finally, application
of the electroporation pulses during IRE procedures requires
less than 1 second. This feature contrasts significantly with the
duration required for radiofrequency ablation methods, which
typically involve application of thermal energy for upward of
8 to 20 minutes per ablation to achieve sufficient temperatures
for coagulative necrosis (43). Recently, a commercially
developed electroporation device received 510 k approval
from the Food and Drug Administration (NanoKnife;

www.aacrjournals.org

AngioDynamics, Inc.). Given the promising results of our current IRE ablation studies on the N1-S1 rat hepatoma model,
future studies are warranted to further investigate the efficacy
of such devices for targeted treatment of liver tumors as well
as additional tumor etiologies that can be difficult to treat
with conventional ablation methods.
One limitation of our study was the lack of intraprocedural imaging guidance to optimize the placement of IRE

electrodes; suboptimal electrode placement could conceivably have led to the incomplete response observed for
one rat in group 3.
During previous studies, ultrasound imaging methods
were used for intraprocedural visualization of IRE ablation
procedures (44). In future HCC IRE studies, ultrasound,
MRI, or computed tomography techniques could be used
to optimize placement of IRE electrodes to ensure that the
targeted tumor mass is entirely contained within the anticipated IRE ablation zone. Functional imaging methods (dynamic contrast–enhanced computed tomography/MRI and/
or diffusion-weighted MRI) may prove useful for immediate
or early detection of IRE treatment response.
For these initial studies, we did not individually tailor the
IRE protocol (voltage, electrode spacing) to produce an ablation zone specific to each individual tumor size. We simply
used a single IRE protocol producing an ablation zone size
that we anticipated would be sufficiently large to cover all
tumors below one given size. For our studies, we did not experience any gross complications due to damage to adjacent
liver parenchyma. However, we would anticipate that the use
of much larger ablation zones would lead to decomposition
and subsequent liver failure. An individualized, patientspecific approach could be important for clinical IRE applications given a desire to spare normal liver tissues to
preserve function. As shown during prior studies (30), optimization of the IRE ablation volumes should be possible using preprocedural FEM simulations. Further studies are

warranted to rigorously investigate the potential to individually tailor the size of IRE ablation zones to ensure complete
treatment of targeted tumors while sparing as much surrounding normal liver tissue as possible.
In conclusion, this preclinical study showed the feasibility
of using IRE as a novel ablation modality for targeted treatment of hepatoma in the N1-S1 rat model. Follow-up MRI
images showed significant tumor size reductions and histology correlation studies showed extensive tumor necrosis
within 7 to 15 days posttherapy. IRE is a promising new
approach for liver-directed treatment of HCC and may
offer multiple potential benefits over conventional ablation
methods.
