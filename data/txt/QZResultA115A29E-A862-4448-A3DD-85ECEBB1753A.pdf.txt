Abstract

Author Manuscript

Src tyrosine kinase (Src) is implicated in the development of bone metastasis and castrationresistance of prostate cancer. Src inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical trials for such
diseases. Understanding the molecular and cellular actions of Src inhibitors holds the key to future
improvement of this line of therapy. Here we describe the microRNA (miRNA) expression
profiles modulated by two Src inhibitors and demonstrate that the miR-30 family members are the
most prominently induced species. Consistent with its tumor suppressor role, miR-30 is
downmodulated by oncogenic signals such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), and is generally underexpressed in prostate cancer specimens. A number of
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated genes are predicted targets of miR-30.
Among these genes the Ets Related Gene (ERG) is the most frequently overexpressed-oncogene in
prostate cancer activated by genomic fusion events between promoter upstream sequences of the
TMPRSS2 and coding sequences of ERG. We showed by ERG 3′UTR-reporter and mutagenesis
assays that ERG is a direct target of miR-30. Overexpression of miR-30 in prostate cancer cells
suppresses EMT phenotypes and inhibits cell migration and invasion. It also inhibits the in vitro
and in vivo growth of VCaP cells, which depends on TMPRSS2-ERG for proliferation.
TMPRSS2-ERG is generally regulated by androgen at the transcriptional level. Our finding
reveals a new post-transcriptional mechanism of TMPRSS2-ERG regulation by Src and growth
signals via miR-30 providing a rationale for targeting ERG positive castration resistant tumors
with Src inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Author Manuscript

Src tyrosine kinase is widely expressed and implicated in the development of human
malignancies including castration-resistance prostate cancer (1, 2). In mouse models, Src
was found to synergize with the androgen receptor (AR) in the transformation of prostate
epithelial cells to invasive adenocarcinoma (3). We showed previously that in prostate
cancer cells, Src is complexed with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Etk tyrosine kinases,
which trans-phosphorylate one another to induce migration and invasion (4). Src also
regulates osteoclastic activity and promotes bone metastasis of prostate cancer cells (5, 6).
Regarding its role in castration-resistant prostate cancer, Src is shown to activate AR in
androgen-depleted conditions and facilitates the translocation of AR into nucleus upon
activation by growth factors, cytokines and chemokines (4, 7–9). In addition, Src directly
phosphorylates, stabilizes and translocates AR to chromatin target sites (9–11). While Src is
able to activate AR and serves as its coactivator, Src is reciprocally activated by AR and acts
as a downstream effector for AR signaling both in a genomic and nongenomic manner (3,
12). Thus, there is considerable evidence connecting Src signals to prostate carcinogenesis,
raising the possibility of targeting Src kinase as a potential therapy. Previous studies
demonstrated that Src selective inhibitors such as saracatinib and dasatinib were effective in
inhibiting growth, adhesion, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro (13, 14).
In preclinical models, the primary effects of Src inhibitors appear to be the blockade of
metastasis (14). We showed that Src inhibitors arrested cell cycle progression but did not
induce significant apoptosis, due largely to the concurrent induction of autophagy, which
confers a survival advantage (15). The addition of an autophagy inhibitor effectively
overcomes the apoptosis-resistance of Src inhibitor treated prostate cancer cells. Presently,
several commercial specific oral Src kinase inhibitors are being tested in Phase I and II
clinical trials for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer (16, 17). To improve the
efficacy of Src inhibitors and its potential use as an adjunctive therapy, it is imperative to
understand the Src kinase signals affected by the treatments. Src kinases channel signals
through the conventional Ras/Raf/ERK and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways (18), but also
selectively activate Stat3(19), c-myc (19) and β-catenin (20). These Src induced signals were
attenuated in saracatinib-treated PC3 cells (14). In addition to phsophorylation signals, Src
activation also leads to the up- and down-modulation of a variety of microRNAs (miRNAs)
involved in transformation and oncogenesis (21). Few of these miRNA studies were
conducted in prostate cancer cells and the effects of Src inhibitor on the expression of these
oncomirs remain unknown.
ERG (Ets-related-gene) is the most frequently overexpressed and translocated oncogene in
prostate cancer cells (22, 23) and over 50% of prostate cancer specimens carry a
translocation involving the 5′ promoter upstream sequences of the TMPRSS2, an androgen
regulated gene, and 3′ coding exons of ERG, resulting in a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion
transcripts (24). Most of the ERG coding sequences are retained in the fusion transcript,

which in the context of gene fusion is under the transcriptional control of androgens.
TMPRSS2-ERG appears to be a specific biomarker for prostate cancer cells, as normal
prostate epithelial cells and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) do not harbor such a
translocation. Engineered mice with prostate specific overexpression of ERG develop
cellular morphology that resembles precursor-like lesions of human prostate cancer (25–27).
When complemented with lesions in the PI3K pathway, progressive prostatic
adenocarcinomas were induced in these mouse models (28). Knockdown of ERG diminishes
the proliferative, invasive and migratory ability of prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in
vivo (26, 29, 30). Both EZH2 (31), FZD4 (32), ZEB1 (33) and C-MYC (30) are shown to be
the downstream targets of ERG that mediate the ERG-induced EMT and block epithelial
differentiation. In experimental models TMPRSS2 to ERG translocation can be induced by
radiation when combined with activation of AR (31, 34, 35). Under androgen-deprived
conditions, in a subset of relapsed tumors, abundant ERG expression, however, could be
identified and in castration-resistant VCaP xenograft model harboring TMPRSS2-ERG
translocation, ERG expression is maintained under castration conditions (36). The persistent
expression of ERG in a subset of castration resistant prostate cancer cases prompted us to
investigate other modes of ERG activation that are not solely dependent upon external
androgen. In the present study we report the identification of an alternative pathway
whereby ERG expression can be upregulated by EGF and SRC via miRNA modulation. Our
study has revealed a new crosstalk between the EGF/Src and androgen/AR signaling axes.

RESULTS

Src inhibitors upregulate miR-30 in VCaP cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To investigate miRNAs regulated by c-Src kinase during the progression of advanced
prostate cancer, vertebral metastatic lesion-derived VCaP cells were treated for 24 h with
saracatinib (AstraZenca) or PP2 (Pfizer), selective inhibitors of Src-family tyrosine kinases,
and the associated changes in miRNA abundance were analyzed by microarrays (containing
132 miRNAs, Signosis). The testing of two different Src inhibitors was intended to
minimize the off-target effects of these inhibitors. In the analysis, only miRNAs commonly
regulated by both inhibitors were scored. Compared to the control untreated cells, 10
miRNAs were upregulated and 13 miRNAs were downregulated more than 1.5-fold by both
inhibitors. Among these miRNAs, the miR-30 family (including miR-30a-5p and miR-30b)
was the most increased (Figure 1A). To validate the microarray results, quantitative realtime PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to analyze the level of mature miR-30 in VCaP and
another prostate cancer PC3 cells after 24 h treatments of saracatinib and PP2. Both
saracatinib and PP2 significantly increased the expression level of both miR-30a-5p (Figure
1B, left panel) and miR-30b (Figure 1B, right panel) in VCaP and PC3 cells. However, only
modest inductions of miR-30c were observed (Supplementary Figure S1). These studies
confirmed the microarray data of miR-30 upregulation by Src inhibitors, and showed that
such upregulations are not restricted to VCaP cells.
If Src inhibitors upregulate miR-30, Src agonist should suppress miR-30 expression.
Signaling by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or its receptor (EGFR) is known to activate Src
in prostate cancer cells (9). When VCaP cells were treated with EGF, the expression level of

miR-30a (Figure 1C, left panel) and miR-30b (Figure 1C, right panel) were significantly
suppressed by EGF treatment, as expected. By contrast, treatment with gefitinib, an inhibitor
of EGFR, upregulated both miR-30a and miR-30b. In addition, the EGF-induced miR-30
downregulation could be completely offset by blocking Src activity with PP2, indicating Src
is a major mediator of EGF’s modulation of miR-30. We also tested IL-6 and hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF), two ligands known to activate Src via their respective receptors (4);
both suppressed the expression of miR-30, although their potencies are not as high as EGF
(Figure 1C).
miR-30 is downmodulated in prostate cancers

Author Manuscript

The above results suggest that miR-30 is suppressed by oncogenic signals. Together with the
large body of literature showing reduced expression of miR-30 in a variety of tumors (37–
39), they support the notion that the miR-30 family may be associated with tumor suppressor
functions in prostate cancer. We analyzed the expression pattern of miR-30a and miR-30b in
prostate cancer cell lines by qRT-PCR. All prostate cancer cell lines tested expressed a
modest but significant level of miR-30, which is lower than the immortalized normal
epithelial-derived cell line RWPE-1 (Figure 2A). We then analyzed miR-30 expression in a
series of clinical specimens. The mean expression level of miR-30a-5p (Figure 2B, left
panel) and miR-30b (Figure 2B, right panel) in tumor samples are significantly lower than
that of the benign tissues, consistent with an early report that demonstrated the
downmodulation of miR-30 in hormone-refractory prostate cancer (38), as well as prostate
CD44+ cancer stem cell population (40).
Ectopic expression of miR-30 inhibits EMT

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To test whether miR-30 functionally behaves as a tumor suppressor, we stably
overexpressed miR-30b in VCaP and PC3 using lentiviral vector carrying mature miR-30b
sequence. Since a major effect of Src-inhibitor is the suppression of tumor invasion and
metastasis, we were particularly interested in the effect of miR-30 on genes related to
metastasis/EMT. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure these genes in pooled
populations of VCaP overexpressing miR-30b. Strikingly, the majority of the EMTassociated genes tested were downmodulated by miR-30b overexpression. They include
ZEB1, TWIST, ZEB2, SPARC, MMP3 and LIN28, with BMP7, N-cadherin (CDH2), ERG,
Notch1 and SNAI1 being the most severely (>80%) affected (Figure 3A). These data
suggest that miR-30b inhibits EMT. Further evaluation of the role of miR-30b in EMT
modulation was carried out by immunostaining of N-cadherin and E-cadherin (Figure 3B).
In this study, we also included cells infected with lentivirus carrying anti-miR30b
(antagomir against miR-30b). We found that miR-30b overexpression leads to an increase of
E-cadherin and a decrease of N-cadherin expression, and the reverse is true for anti-miR30b.
Next, we examined the effect of miR-30 on cell migration and invasion using transwell
assay. The cell invasion ability was significantly restrained (p<0.05, Figure 3C) in miR-30boverexpressing VCaP cells. We next overexpressed miR-30b in PC3 cells and showed with
wound scratch assay that PC3 cells overexpressing miR-30b migrate much more slowly than
the control cells (Figure 3D). Furthermore, to examine whether miR-30 is involved in the
suppression of Src-regulated EMT, anti-miR30a/b was overexpressed in VCaP cells
followed by treatment with saracatinib in the transwell migration assay. Overexpression of

anti-miR30a/b reversed the inhibition of VCaP migration by saracatinib (Supplementary
Figure S2). Taken together, these results suggest that miR-30 functions to maintain the
epithelial phenotype and inhibits migration, invasion and EMT of prostate cancer cells.
miR-30 directly targets the ERG 3′UTR

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In the EMT genes tested in Figure 3A, ERG was among the most severely suppressed by
miR-30. In addition, the expression level of ERG was significantly higher in the human
prostate cancer specimens compared to the BPH specimens (Supplementary Figure S3),
while the miR-30 expression level was lower in prostate cancer and higher in BPH tissue
(Figure 2B). Computational prediction with TargetScan software (http://
www.targetscan.org) revealed that an evolutionarily conserved region in the ERG 3′UTR
mRNA has a perfect complementary matching region (UGUUUACA) to the seed sequence
(ACAAAUGU) of the miR-30 family (Figure 4A). As shown in Figure 4B, 4C and
Supplementary Figure S4, TMPRSS2-ERG protein and mRNA expressions were
downregulated by miR-30 overexpression in VCaP cells. To examine whether miR-30
attenuates ERG expression through direct targeting of the predicted 3′UTR region, a 42-base
pair fragment of the ERG 3′UTR containing the wild-type or mutant miR-30 binding site
were constructed downstream of the luciferase gene in a reporter plasmid (UTR-reporter;
Figure 4A). 293T cells were transfected with the UTR-reporter plus the negative control
miRNA (miR-NC), miR-30a or miR-30b. Only transfection of miR-30a and miR-30b with
the wild-type UTR-reporter led to a significant decrease of luciferase activity whereas coexpression of the antagomirs of miR-30 has no effect on the reporter activities (Figure 4D).
In addition, the suppressive effects of miR-30a and miR-30b were abolished with the mutant
UTR-reporter in which the seed sequences were altered (Figure 4E). Together, these results
demonstrate that miR-30 directly targets the ERG 3′UTR, thereby reducing TMPRSS2-ERG
expression.
TMPRSS2-ERG expression is regulated by EGF signaling

Author Manuscript

Our data above showed that inhibiting Src signals augments the expression of miR-30 and
that miR-30 negatively regulates ERG expression. Since Src is activated by EGF (via
EGFR), we then asked whether inhibiting Src or EGFR would inhibit the expression of
TMPRSS2-ERG. We first tested the role of EGF in TMPRSS2-EGR expression and, as
shown in Figure 5A, showed that TMPRSS2-ERG was indeed induced dose-dependently by
EGF in VCaP cells. VCaP cells were then treated with increasing doses of the EGFR
inhibitor AG1478 (AstraZeneca) and Src inhibitors (saracatinib and PP2) and the
TMPRSS2-ERG expression was monitored with Western blotting (Figure 5B) and qRTPCR (Figure 5C). Inhibition of either EGFR signal or Src activity downmodulated
TMPRSS2-ERG expression both at the protein and transcript level (Figure 5B and 5C).
These data support the hypothesis that TMPRSS2-ERG is regulated by EGF and Src
signaling through miR-30 modulation. Thus, we have identified a new way to modulate
TMPRSS2-ERG or ERG expression in an androgen independent manner. To our knowledge,
this is the first report that showed the modulation of ERG by growth factors and tyrosine
kinases.

Ectopic expression of miR-30 and tumorigenesis

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

TMPRSS2-ERG is known to play a critical role in the malignant transformation of prostate
cancer cells. Knockdown of ERG is found to be associated with decreased proliferation,
invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo (30, 33). If ERG is an
important target of miR-30, we should observe a similar phenotype of miR-30b
overexpressor to ERG knockdown cells. To this end, we prepared VCaP cells infected with
lentiviral-shRNA targeting ERG to establish a pool of VCaP/shERG cells. There was a
significant inhibition of cell growth in response to overexpression of miR-30b or
knockdown ERG in VCaP cells compared to the control cells (Figure 6A). To determine if
overexpression of miR-30b decreased cell growth in vivo, the genetically modified cell lines
were subcutaneously injected into NOD/SCID mice. Serial weekly measurements showed
tumor growth was suppressed in VCaP/miR-30b implants compared to vector control
(Figure 6B).

DISCUSSION
An alternative way of modulating ERG expression

Author Manuscript

Increasing evidence suggests that overexpression of TMPRSS2-ERG plays a significant role
in the transformation, EMT and invasion of prostate cancer. In primary tumors the major
driver of the overexpression of TMPRSS2-ERG is androgen. In the present study, we have
identified a new signaling pathway, which connects EGF and Src signaling to ERG
activation and EMT. This connection is made through the silencing of the miR-30b locus,
which targets ERG at its 3′UTR. This alternative mode of modulation at the RNA level
should be independent of and complement to the transcriptional regulation mediated by the
androgen/AR axis. We also provide data showing EGFR and Src inhibitions are able to
modulate TMPRSS2-ERG expression. This is especially relevant in castration-resistant
prostate cancer where the AR is aberrantly activated in the absence androgen. By targeting
the RNA stability or translation, Src inhibitor offers another way of downmodulating ERG
expression.
Src and miRNA modulation

Author Manuscript

Src mediates oncogenesis by modulating oncogenes as well as oncomirs (41). miR-30 was
among the oncomirs downmodulated in Src-transformed cells (21). We report here that
miR-30a-5p and miR-30b are the two top upregulated miRNAs by the Src selective inhibitor
saracatinib. Similar findings using PP2 substantiated the specificity of the observed
response. In a previous study, showed that miR-30b and miR-30c were upregulated by both
EGFR and MET in lung cancer cells (42). This discrepancy is most likely due to the cell
type specificity and the complex signal network induced by EGF/EGFR.
EZH2 overexpression in advanced prostate cancer leads to epigenetic silencing of
developmental regulators and tumor suppressor genes. Regulation of EZH2 that catalyzes
trimethylation of histone H3 on Lys27 (H3K27me3) is typically associated with gene
repression. Consistent with the observation that Src inhibitor (bosutinib) downmodulates
EZH2 (43), we found that Src activation increases the recruitment of EZH2 and H3K27me3
marks on miR-30b locus in VCaP cells (Supplementary Figure S5). The exact mechanism as

to how Src signal activates EZH2, which in turn, suppresses the expression of miR-30
remains to be elucidated. Other common miRNAs upregulated by both Src inhibitors include
Let7i, which targets C-MYC. It has long been recognized that Src transcriptionally activates
C-MYC. The detailed mechanisms are not fully understood. Let7i suppression by Src
signals could be one reason how C-MYC is activated by Src, and miR-30’s suppression
could be another, since miR-30’s target ERG is known to be a direct activator of C-MYC
(22, 27, 30).
The role of miRNA-30 in prostate cancer

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

miR-30 was described as a “hub” for miRNA oncogenesis signal network in solid tumors
(37). Its up- or down- modulation has profound impacts on tumorigenesis. In this report, we
showed that miR-30 is downmodulated in prostate cancer cells, especially at the metastatic
stage. Porkka et al. (38) has identified 15 miRNAs whose expressions are reduced in
castration resistant prostate cancer and miR-30a-5p, miR-30b and miR-30c are among them.
Liu et al. (40) showed that miR-30a-5p, miR-30c are commonly downmodulated in three
CD44+ cancer stem cell lines. Downmodulation of miR-30 is also found in a variety of
tumors (38, 39). This is consistent with the tumor suppressor role of miR-30, which has been
shown to induce cellular senescence by negatively regulating B-MYB (44), inhibit self
renewal and metastasis of breast tumor initiating cells (45), repress the stem cell and cancer
phenotypes via targeting LIN28 (46), and suppress EMT and invasive potential of anaplastic
thyroid carcinomas (47). Perhaps, noncoincidentally, a significant fraction of predicted
miR-30 direct targets are involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We showed
potential targets, ERG, SNAI1, SPARC, MMP3, Notch1, LIN28, and ZEB1/ZEB2, are all
downmodulated in response to miR-30b overexpression. We have demonstrated that ERG is
a direct target of miR-30. Downregulation of ZEB1, TWIST, ZEB2, SPARC, MMP3 and
LIN28, BMP7, CDH2, ERG, Notch1 and SNAI1 may either be direct response to miR-30 or
secondary to ERG. Prior studies showed SNAIL1 and vimentin are two direct targets of
miR-30, which inhibits TGFβ-induced EMT in one case (48) and confers an epithelial
phenotype to human pancreatic cells in the other case (49). Consistent with miR-30’s role in
suppressing EMT, we found VCaP cells overexpressing miR-30b display reduced
expression of N-cadherin and lower migratory and invasive ability. Our qRT-PCR results
showed that many EMT genes are downmodulated in VCaP. A similar trend is also observed
for PC3 cells expressing ETV4, a close homologue of ERG (50) (data not shown). Our data
as well as others taken together suggest that miR-30b is a key modulator of EMT, and
miR-30’s effect is further augmented in VCaP cells by its direct targeting of ERG. In
addition to the reversion of EMT, targeting ERG by miR-30b also resulted in the inhibition
of VCaP growth both in vitro and in vivo. Recent study has shown that miR-30b/c target
caspase-3, which in turn, regulated TRAIL-induced apoptosis in glioblastoma cells (51).
However, in our previous study, neither saracatinib nor PP2 induced any caspase-3 activity
or apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (15). Accordingly, no significant apoptosis regulation
by miR-30a/b was seen. The results of the present study, and the consistent observation of
reduced expression of miR-30 in human prostate cancer specimens, suggest that miR-30 is a
bona-fide tumor suppressor in the context of prostate cancer. Restoration of miR-30
function, either by itself or in conjunction with other therapies, may improve the survival by
inhibiting the growth and metastasis of castration resistant prostate cancer.

with 8 μm pore 24 well plate (Corning Life Sciences; Tewksbury MA) for 48 h. Invaded
cells on the bottom of the insert membrane were stained with crystal violet then
subsequently extracted and detected on a standard microplate reader at 540 nm absorbance.
For the wound scratch assay, cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 12-well culture dish and grown
up to 90% confluence. A single wound was made in the center of cell monolayer and cell

debris was removed by washing twice with PBS. Complete medium was added and cells
were allowed to migrate into the clearing area for 48 h. The wound closure areas were
visualized under an inverted microscope with 100X magnification, and the migrated cells
were counted.
Proliferation assay
Cells were seeded (2.5 × 104 per well) in triplicates in 48-well plates. Cell growth was
monitored by using the cell proliferation kit I (MTT; Roche Applied Science) at day 1, 3, 6,
and 9 days according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

All experimental procedures using animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) of UC Davis. 1×106 cells in 100 μL of 50% Matrigel were
subcutaneous injected into the flank of 6 to 8 week old NOD/SCID mice (Jackson
Laboratory; Bar Harbor, Maine).
Statistic analysis
Comparisons between experimental conditions and controls were made using GraphPad
Prism version 5.01 (GraphPad Software; La Jolla, CA) by two-tailed unpaired Student’s ttest or two way ANOVA. All results are expressed as mean ± S.D. and p-values <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
