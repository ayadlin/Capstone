BACKGROUND. Obesity has a variety of adverse health outcomes, but to the authors’
knowledge, the effect of obesity on outcome in patients with advanced prostate cancer is not known. For this reason, the correlation between an elevated body mass
index (BMI) and clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic, castration–recurrent
prostate cancer (CRPC) was evaluated.

METHODS. A total of 1226 men with CRPC who were enrolled in 9 prospective clinical

one); an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2; and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. Patients were classified based on
BMI as normal (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25–29.9 kg/m2), and mildly to severely
obese (30 kg/m2).

RESULTS. Approximately 24% of the patients had a normal BMI, 43% were overweight, and 33% were mildly to severely obese. On multivariable analysis, BMI was
found to be a statistically significant predictor of overall survival and prostate cancer–specific mortality. Compared with men with normal BMIs, the hazard ratios for
death for overweight men and mildly to severely obese men were 0.80 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.68–0.93; P 5 .001) and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68–0.94; P 5 .010),
respectively.

CONCLUSIONS. In patients with metastatic CRPC, obesity (as defined by an elevated
BMI) appears to have a protective effect against overall mortality and prostate cancer–specific mortality. Alternatively, a higher BMI may reflect different cancer biology
(ie, the lack of cachexia–producing substances). Further studies to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind these clinical observations are
needed. Cancer 2007;110:1478–84.  2007 American Cancer Society.

t is estimated that approximately two–thirds of the U.S. population
are either overweight or obese.1 Obesity has been shown to increase
the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.2–4 The association
between obesity and the risk of certain malignancies, such as colon
cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer, and renal cell carcinoma, is
reasonably well established. There has been some evidence linking
obesity with prostate cancer risk, although this remains an issue of
considerable debate.
However, there is burgeoning evidence that obese prostate cancer
patients have less favorable outcomes compared with their normal–
weight counterparts.2–16 A substantial body of research has emerged in
recent years with regard to obesity and its effect on various outcomes

such as pathologic findings at the time of radical prostatectomy,5 biochemical (prostate–specific antigen [PSA])
disease progression,6–16 and clinical disease progression.16
To our knowledge, the majority of the literature
published to date consists of studies of men with
hormone–sensitive disease. However, little is known
regarding the role of obesity in men with progressive
prostate cancer despite androgen deprivation therapy,
herein referred to as castration–recurrent prostate cancer (CRPC). Reports by Amling et al.11 and Freedland
et al.13 linking obesity and adverse outcomes in patients
with localized (hormone–sensitive) prostate cancer
were the basis for the current evaluation of the correlation between obesity or body mass index (BMI) with
clinical outcomes in 1296 men with CRPC who were enrolled on clinical trials conducted by the Cancer and
Leukemia Group B (CALGB). We asked the question as
to whether an elevated BMI is predictive of worse clinical outcomes in men with CRPC. A preliminary analysis
of the impact of BMI on overall survival was published
previously elsewhere.17

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Combined data from 1296 men with CRPC who were
treated on 9 CALGB multi–institutional clinical trials
between 1991 and 2004 were evaluated. Eligible
patients were men with prostate cancer that had progressed during castrate levels of testosterone. Patients
who had received prior treatment with chemotherapy,
immunotherapy, or other nonhormonal therapy were
excluded from these trials. In addition, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
of 0 to 2 and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic
function were required. Additional details regarding
these trials have been published elsewhere.18,19 Each
participant signed an Institutional Review Board–
approved, informed consent document in accordance
with federal and institutional guidelines.
Statistical Considerations
The primary endpoint considered was overall survival
(OS), which was defined as the time from the date of
randomization or study entry to the date of death. In
addition, the effect of BMI on other endpoints was
explored, including prostate cancer–specific–free survival (PCSFS), progression–free survival (PFS), a 50%
decline in PSA as a consequence of protocol treatment,
and objective (bidimensionally measurable) response
proportion. PCSFS was defined as the time from the
date of randomization or study entry to the date of
patient death due to prostate cancer. The principal

1479

investigators of each study determined the cause of
death for each patient based on the case report forms
submitted by the local treating physician. PFS was
defined as the time from the date of randomization or
study entry to the date of first disease progression (PSA,
clinical, or bone) or death, whichever occurred first. A
50% decline in post–therapy PSA was defined as a 50%
decline in PSA from baseline confirmed by a second
determination at least 2 weeks apart. Although PSA
Consensus Criteria were not developed at the time several of these trials were conducted, these standard criteria were used for retrospective analysis of the data.20
BMI at study entry was defined as the ratio of
weight (in kg) divided by height squared (in meters).
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) definition for
classifying patients on the basis of BMI was utilized,
which uses the following categories: underweight (BMI
<18.5 kg/m2), normal (BMI of 18.5–24.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI of 25–29.9 kg/m2), mildly obese (BMI of
30–34.9 kg/m2), and moderately to severely obese (BMI
35 kg/m2). There were 11 men who were underweight
(BMI <18.5 kg/m2) and these patients were excluded
from the analysis. Furthermore, due to a paucity of
events (deaths) in the moderately to severely obese
(BMI 35 kg/m2) group, these men were categorized in
the mildly obese group (BMI 30 kg/m2). In addition,
59 patients who had either missing height or weight
data were excluded from the analysis, which lead to a
final sample size of 1226 men.
The Kaplan–Meier product–limit21 method was
used to estimate the OS, PCSFS, and PFS distributions
by the BMI. Because of an observed trend for an
increased BMI over time, the proportional hazards
model was used to assess the prognostic significance of
BMI in predicting clinical outcomes and was used for
stratifying by protocol, which basically is the year of
treatment. The proportional hazards assumption was
assessed using a global test based on the Schoenfeld
residuals.22 In addition, the logistic regression model
was used to assess the prognostic significance of BMI in
predicting the probability of experiencing an objective
(bidimensional mass) response and the probability of a
50% decline in post–therapy PSA.
On the multivariable models, men who had a normal BMI index were considered as the reference group.
Known and established prognostic variables,23,24
including age, race, ECOG performance status, Gleason
score, hemoglobin, testosterone, PSA, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the presence of
visceral disease, prior treatment with radiotherapy, and
years since diagnosis, were included in the multivariate
models. Age, hemoglobin, and testosterone were
modeled as continuous variables whereas race, ECOG
performance status, Gleason score, the presence of

visceral disease, and prior treatment with radiotherapy
were modeled as categoric variables. LDH, years since
diagnosis, alkaline phosphatase, and PSA were modeled
using the restricted cubic spline function because they
had skewed distribution. S–plus statistical software was
used for the data analyses and all statistical tests were
2–sided.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
The baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics
of the 1226 patients are summarized in Table 1.
Approximately 24% (300 patients) of the patients
had a normal BMI (18.5–24.9 kg/m2), 43% (521

patients) were in the overweight category (25–29.9
kg/m2), and 33% (405 patients) were in the mildly to
severely obese category (30 kg/m2). There were statistically significant differences noted with regard to
age, ECOG performance status, hemoglobin levels,
and PSA levels across BMI categories. However, there
were no statistically significant differences noted in
BMI by racial groups.
Men who were moderately or severely obese had a
better ECOG performance status, higher levels of hemoglobin, and lower PSA levels than men with a normal BMI. Furthermore, a higher proportion of men in
the obese group received medical castration compared
with men in the normal BMI and overweight groups.
This finding was statistically significant.

FIGURE 1. Kaplan–Meier survival curves by body mass index (BMI).
Overall Survival
Of the 1226 men, 94% had died by the time of the current analysis, and the median follow–up among surviving patients was 33.8 months (95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 24.4–41.4 months). The survival times were
found to be statistically correlated with BMI. The median survival times were 11.5 months (95% CI, 9.3–12.7
months) for men with normal a BMI, 16.1 months (95%
CI, 14.2–17.8 months) for overweight men, and 16.9
months (95% CI, 15.0–18.5 months) for mildly to
severely obese men (P <.001) (Fig. 1).
The results of the multivariable analysis for OS
are presented in Table 2. BMI was found to be a
statistically significant predictor of survival time.
Compared with men with a normal BMI, the adjusted
hazard ratios (HRs) for death for overweight patients
was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68–0.93; P 5 .001) and was 0.80
for mildly to severely obese patients (95% CI, 0.68–
0.94; P 5 .010).

Prostate Cancer–Specific–Free Survival
Of 1152 patients who had died at the time of last follow–up, 84% were determined to have died of prostate
cancer. The median times to prostate cancer death
were 12.7 months (95% CI, 11.3–15.8 months) for men
with normal BMIs, 17.6 months (95% CI, 15.7–18.7
months) for overweight men, and 18.9 months (95% CI,
16.7–20.9 months) for mildly to severely obese men (P
<.001). Compared with men with a normal BMI, the
HR for prostate cancer death was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.70–
0.97; P 5 .02) for overweight patients and was 0.81 (95%
CI, 0.68–0.97; P 5 .02) for mildly to severely obese men

Progression–Free and PSA Progression–Free Survival
The median times to first disease progression (clinical disease progression, bone progression, PSA progression, or death) were 2.5 months (95% CI, 2.2–2.8
months) for men with a normal BMI, 2.6 months
(95% CI, 2.2–3.0 months) for overweight men, and
2.7 months (95% CI, 2.5–3.1 months) for mildly to
severely obese men (P 5 .022). On multivariate analysis, BMI was not found to be a statistically significant predictor of PFS. Compared with men with a
normal BMI, the HR for disease progression in overweight patients was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.78–1.05; P 5 .18)
and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.76–1.05; P 5 .16) for mildly to

DISCUSSION
Objective Response and 50% Decline in Post–therapy
Changes in PSA
The association between BMI and objective response
was also explored. Men with a normal BMI were found
to have the lowest objective response rate compared
with men with a higher BMI. Men who were overweight
were 1.94 more likely to respond (95% CI, 0.94–4.00;
P 5 .07) than men who had a normal BMI. Furthermore, the unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for response was
2.1 (95% CI, 1.0–4.4; P 5 .05) for men who were mildly
to severely obese compared with men with a normal
BMI. On multivariable logistic regression analysis
adjusted for race and ECOG performance status, the
ORs for objective response were 1.85 (95% CI, 0.89–
3.84; P 5 .09) for men who were mildly to severely
obese and 2.00 (95% CI, 0.94–4.27; P 5 .07) for men
who were overweight compared with men with normal
BMIs.
However, there was no association noted between
BMI and post–therapy changes in PSA. Men with a normal BMI (33%) had similar proportions of 50%
decline in PSA compared with overweight men (35%) or
mildly to severely obese men (34%) (P 5 .74).

The results of this retrospective analysis demonstrate a
protective effect of elevated BMI on clinical outcomes
in men with metastatic CRPC. On multivariable
models, men with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2 and a BMI
of 30 kg/m2 were found to have longer survival times
and time to prostate cancer death than men with normal BMIs. Furthermore, although not statistically significant, there was a trend toward a lower HR of disease
progression and higher objective response rates among
overweight or mildly to severely obese men compared
with normal men.
These results stand in contrast to data reported for
men with localized, hormone–sensitive disease, in
whom obesity is an adverse risk factor for a variety of
clinical outcomes. However, the correlation between
obesity and outcomes for patients with prostate cancer
is both complex and not well understood. Part of the
difficulty in elucidating this correlation is that any
meaningful analysis involving obesity must adjust for
potential confounding variables such as race, age,
socioeconomic status, and comorbidities. Large prospective studies have demonstrated an association
between obesity and prostate cancer mortality.25,26
Using data from the Cancer Prevention Study I and II,

Inverse Correlation Between BMI and Clinical Outcomes/Halabi et al.

Rodriguez et al. observed that obese men were at a
higher risk of dying of prostate cancer.25 Furthermore,
in an analysis of 404,576 men enrolled in the Cancer
Prevention Study II, Calle et al. indicated a statistically
significant linear trend in prostate cancer mortality
with an elevated BMI.26
Several studies have shown that obesity increases
the risk of prostate cancer recurrence and disease progression in men with localized disease who were treated
with radical prostatectomy.6–13,16 In a study of 3162
men who underwent radical prostatectomy, Amling
et al. reported that an elevated BMI was associated with
a greater frequency of adverse pathologic outcomes.11
Obese patients, defined as having a BMI 30 kg/m2,
had higher–grade disease and more frequently positive
surgical margins. Although the univariate HR for a BMI
30 kg/m2 was found to be statistically significant (HR
of 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02–1.42 [P 5 .028]) on multivariable
analysis, BMI was not found to be a statistically significant predictor of biochemical failure–free survival.
Similarly, Freedland et al. assessed the correlation
between obesity and time to biochemical disease progression in 1106 men who were treated with radical
prostatectomy using the SEARCH database.13 On multivariate analysis, the HR for biochemical failure was 2.09
(95% CI, 1.30–3.37; P 5 .002) for patients with a BMI
indicating moderate to extreme obesity compared with
men who had a normal BMI. In an analysis of 2796
men treated at a single institution (Johns Hopkins),
Freedland et al. confirmed this observation.9 In a recent
study that used data regarding 2131 men who underwent radical prostatectomy from the CaPSURE database, Bassett et al. demonstrated that very obese men
(BMI of 35 kg/m2) had a higher risk of disease recurrence than men with a lower BMI.12 Unlike the studies
by Amling et al. and Freedland et al., the current study
controlled for significant comorbidities such as diabetes on the multivariate model, and confirmed the correlation between BMI and biochemical failure in men
treated with radical prostatectomy. Of the above studies, the report by Strom et al. was among the few that
investigated BMI at more than 1 timepoint (BMI at age
at diagnosis and BMI at age 40 years) and observed a
statistically significant correlation between obesity and
biochemical disease recurrence of prostate cancer in
men who underwent radical prostatectomy.7 Moreover,
the authors observed a similar correlation between obesity and biochemical failure and clinical disease progression in 939 men treated with external beam
radiotherapy.15

observed in the current analysis is in contrast to previously published findings in men with earlier stage disease. We hypothesize that in this population of men

with advanced disease, a lower BMI may reflect cancer cachexia and may serve as surrogate of more
aggressive disease, leading to more rapid disease progression or less effective treatment. Indeed, in the
patient population evaluated in the current study, a
normal BMI was found to be associated with a statistically significantly lower ECOG performance status,
lower levels of hemoglobin, and higher PSA levels
than those found in men with an elevated BMI. Alternatively, obese men may have a higher protein and
calorie reserve, allowing them to withstand the
cachexia–producing effects of advancing CRPC. It is
unclear whether there is a mechanistic biologic link
between obesity and short–term protection from
prostate cancer–induced death. Androgen deprivation therapy apparently induces weight gain, obesity,
and the metabolic syndrome.27 All men in the current
study had undergone androgen deprivation therapy
and were maintained on such. Several studies have
demonstrated that caloric intake and energy imbalance play an important role in this correlation.28
Some authors have suggested that certain hormones associated with obesity, such as leptin and insulin–like growth factor–1 (IGF–I), stimulate the growth of
prostate cancer cells. Obesity is associated with higher
IGF–1 levels and leptin.29–34 However, the correlation
may be dynamic. Recently, adiponectin, a major adipose cytokine that decreases in circulation in obesity
and ameliorates obesity, was identified as an inhibitor
of prostate cancer cell growth.35 Furthermore, a fragment of adiponectin, f–adiponectin, suppresses leptin–
stimulated and/or IGF–1–stimulated, androgen–independent prostate cancer cell line (DU145) growth, as
well as dihydrotestosterone–stimulated, androgen–dependent prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP-FGC) growth.
In addition, f–adiponectin enhances doxorubicin’s inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth.
The strengths of the current analysis were that the
information regarding treatment and the eligibility criteria were prospectively defined and collected. Unlike
the majority of studies reported in the literature, weight
and height were measured in all men before the initiation of chemotherapy and were not based on self–
report. The main limitation of the current study is that
BMI was not measured before the diagnosis of prostate
cancer. However, our clinical experience in this patient
population, who are older and have advanced disease,
is that BMI rarely decreases dramatically until the
patient’s disease is refractory to chemotherapy and
cancer cachexia has set in.
The findings from the current study suggest that
obesity has an impact on clinical outcomes associated
with CRPC, in contrast to earlier stages of prostate cancer. Further studies of the mechanisms underlying this

correlation as well as a prospective validation of these
results are warranted.
