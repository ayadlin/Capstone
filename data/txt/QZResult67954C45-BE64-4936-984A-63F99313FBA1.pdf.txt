ABSTRACT
Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) have potent anti-tumor activities in multiple
myeloma (MM) and are able to enhance the cytotoxic function of natural killer
(NK) cells, important effectors of the immune response against MM. Here, we show
that these drugs can enhance the expression of the NKG2D and DNAM-1 activating
receptor ligands MICA and PVR/CD155 in human MM cell lines and primary malignant
plasma cells. Depletion of cereblon (CRBN) by shRNA interference strongly impaired
upregulation of these ligands and, more interestingly, IMiDs/CRBN-mediated
downregulation of the transcription factors Ikaros (IKZF1), Aiolos (IKZF3) and IRF4
was critical for these regulatory mechanisms. Indeed, shRNA knockdown of IKZF1
or IKZF3 expression was both necessary and sufficient for the upregulation of MICA
and PVR/CD155 expression, suggesting that these transcription factors can repress
these genes; accordingly, the direct interaction and the negative role of IKZF1 and
IKZF3 proteins on MICA and PVR/CD155 promoters were demonstrated. Finally, MICA
expression was enhanced in IRF4-silenced cells, indicating a specific suppressive role
of this transcription factor on MICA gene expression in MM cells.
Taken together, these findings describe novel molecular pathways involved in
the regulation of MICA and PVR/CD155 gene expression and identify the transcription
factors IKZF-1/IKZF-3 and IRF4 as repressors of these genes in MM cells.

INTRODUCTION

to anti-tumor immune response, due to their ability to
recognize and lyse cancer cells. The NK cell cytotoxic
activity is controlled by integrated signals delivered from
a complex set of inhibitory and activating receptors [6, 7].
In this regard, NKG2D and DNAM-1 are two activating
receptors shown to play a prominent role in tumor
immunosurveillance.
NKG2D interacts with multiple ligands, including

hematologic cancer characterized by clonal expansion of

development is supported by a progressive impairment

MHC class I-related chain A/B (MICA/B) and UL16
binding proteins (ULBPs), while DNAM-1 recognizes two
nectin-like proteins, the poliovirus receptor (PVR/CD155)
and Nectin-2 (Nec-2).
NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs) show a restricted
expression on healthy cells, however they are frequently
overexpressed in a wide range of pathological conditions,
including cancer and infection. In tumor cells, their
expression is controlled at different levels by complex
mechanisms only partially characterized. In particular,
oncogenic proliferative and stress signaling pathways
linked to the tumorigenic process, such as DNA damage
response (DDR), can increase their basal expression
[8-10]. Moreover, to escape immune cell mediated
recognition, tumors can downregulate NKG2DLs
expression, via proteolytic shedding from the cell surface
and/or excretion in exosomes [11, 12].
DNAM-1 ligands (DNAM1Ls) are ubiquitously
expressed in various tissues, and their levels increase
in different tumor cells, but the mechanisms leading to
their regulation are largely unknown [13]. In this regard,
evidence is accumulating that the engagement of NKG2D
and DNAM-1 activating receptors is critical for NKmediated killing of myeloma cells, which express NKG2D
and DNAM-1 ligands [4, 14-18]. Thus, improving NK
cell responsiveness may be a promising therapeutic
approach to treat MM; in particular, the modulation of the
balance between activating and inhibitory NK cell signals
and sensitization of cancer cells to NK cell mediatedcytotoxicity may significantly contribute to enhance antimyeloma immune response.
Of note, among novel therapeutic agents used
in MM clinical management, IMiDs [thalidomide,
lenalidomide (CC-5013) and pomalidomide (CC4047)],
have the ability to modulate humoral as well as cellular
components of the innate and adaptive immune responses,
including NK cell activity against cancer cells [5, 19-22].
In particular, an increased number of NK cells expressing
higher levels of the activating receptors NKG2D, NKp30
and NKp44 has been observed in MM patients during
IMiDs therapy [23, 24]; moreover, IMiDs enhance NK cell
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)
activity toward MM cells [25], and can sensitize myeloma
cells to NK cell cytotoxicity by inhibiting the expression
of PD-L1 [26].
In the last few years, the mechanism of action of
IMiDs has becoming increasingly clear. The cellular target
of these drugs is cereblon (CRBN), a ubiquitous protein
which functions as a substrate receptor for the Cullin4-RING Ubiquitin Ligase (CLR4) complex, containing
Cullin-4 (CUL4), DNA damage binding protein-1 (DDB1)
and the RING-finger protein (ROC1) [29, 30].
CRBN is essential for the anti-myeloma activity
of IMiDs and loss of this protein causes drug resistance
in MM cells [30, 31]. IMiDs binding to CRBN alters the
function of the CLR4 [29]; in particular enforced binding
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of IMiDs to CRBN is able to disrupt the recruitment
of some substrates and, at the same time, promotes the
ubiquitination of other proteins, suggesting the possibility
that a neomorphic structure is involved [32, 33].
In this context, recent papers described the capability
of IMiDs to induce CRBN-dependent degradation of the
Ikaros family zinc finger protein-1 (IKZF1, Ikaros) and
3 (IKZF3, Aiolos) [34, 35], two transcription factors
involved in lymphoid development and differentiation
and highly expressed in B cell malignancies, including
MM [36, 37]. Loss of these proteins was shown to
mediate important therapeutic activities of IMiDs, such
as increased IL-2 production by T cells [35, 38] or antiproliferative effects in MM cells [34, 35]. Interestingly, in
MM cells IKZF1 and IKZF3 have also emerged as positive
regulators of the expression of the IRF4 gene [34-36], a
haemopoietic cell-restricted transcription factor, identified
as a key regulator of malignancy-specific gene expression
in MM [39, 40]. In this regard, IMiDs were found to
inhibit IRF4 expression at transcriptional level, mainly
via downregulation of IKZF1/3 transcription factors [34].
In this study, we define novel regulatory
mechanisms of NK cell-activating ligand gene
expression in MM cells. We demonstrate that IMiDs can
upregulate MICA and PVR/CD155 surface expression,
enhancing NK cell recognition and killing. A prominent
role in these regulatory mechanisms is played by the
transcription factors IKZF1/3 and IRF4, able to repress
the basal transcription of mica and pvr gene expression.
Lenalidomide-induced downregulation of these
transcription factors leads to de-repression of mica and
pvr promoter activity, and consequently to increased gene
transcription.
Thus, we identified IKZF1/3 and IRF4 as
“druggable” transcriptional repressors of NK cellactivating ligand expression in MM cells.

RESULTS
IMiDs upregulate MICA and PVR/CD155
expression on human multiple myeloma cells and
enhance their recognition by NK cells
In the last few years, our laboratory has investigated
the expression and regulation of different NKG2D and
DNAM-1 ligands on human MM cells in response to
anti-myeloma agents [16, 27, 41]. In this context, we
and other authors have initially reported the capability
of lenalidomide to increase the expression of several NK
cell-activating ligands on MM cells [27, 28]; however,
the molecular mechanisms involved have not been
investigated yet. To better analyse the effects of IMiDs on
the expression of NK cell-activating ligands, we initially
performed flow cytometric analyses on SKO-007(J3) cells,

stained with anti-CD56, anti-CD3 and anti-CD107a mAbs. Cell surface expression of CD107a was analyzed on FSC/SSC-gated and
CD56+CD3- cells. In order to evaluate the role of NKG2D and DNAM-1, the assay was performed in parallel treating NK cells with
blocking anti-DNAM-1 or anti-NKG2D antibodies. The MFI of CD107a were calculated based on at least three independent experiments
and evaluated by paired Student t test (*P< 0.05). For each treatment, histograms represent the MFI of specific mAb - MFI of isotype
control. D. CD138- bone marrow cells, cultured for 2 days in complete medium supplemented with IL-2 (200 U/mL), were incubated with

a MM cell line known to basally express MICA/B and
PVR/CD155 [16], after 72h-treatment with micromolar
concentrations of lenalidomide or pomalidomide. We
observed that these drugs upregulate the basal expression
of MICA and PVR/CD155 on SKO-007(J3) cells, with no
significant effects on MICB levels (Fig. 1A and 1B and
Suppl. Fig. 1A and 1B). Similar data were also obtained
in other MM cell lines that constitutively express either
one of these ligands: ARP-1 and JJN3 cells for MICA and
KMS27 and OPM-2 cells for PVR/CD155 (Suppl. Fig. 2).
Moreover, where not expressed, we did not observe a neoinduction of these ligands in IMiDs-treated cells (data not
shown).
We could confirm these results also in CD138+ MM
cells from the bone marrow of MM patients, showing
higher surface levels of MICA and/or PVR/CD155
following treatment with lenalidomide (Table 1 and 2).
Of note, in some patient-derived PCs, the drug did not
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

show a significant effect on either MICA or PVR/CD155,
independently from the clinical stage of disease and from
basal level expression of these ligands, suggesting that
different gene-specific mechanisms of regulation could be
involved.
As regards the other NKG2D and DNAM-1 ligands,
SKO-007(J3) cells express low or undetectable levels of
ULBP2/5/6 or ULBP1, ULBP3 and Nec-2 respectively,
and lenalidomide did not modify their surface levels
(Suppl. Fig. 3). These treatments did not affect the cell
viability of these cell lines after 72h-treatment, as assessed
by PI staining (data not shown).
To evaluate the functional consequence of IMiDsinduced changes of MICA and PVR/CD155 expression,
we analyzed the lysosomal marker CD107a (a surrogate
marker for granule mobilization [42]) on NK cells isolated
from healthy donors against SKO-007(J3) cells, untreated
or treated with lenalidomide as described above, by FACS

analysis. As shown in Fig. 1C, basal expression of CD107a
on NK cells was enhanced when co-cultured with SKO007(J3) target cells exposed to lenalidomide; this effect
was significantly inhibited by the combined blocking
anti-NKG2D plus anti-DNAM-1 mAbs, indicating that
stimulation of NK cell degranulation was dependent on
both NKG2D and DNAM-1 activation. Accordingly, a
higher capability of degranulation was also observed in
patient-derived NK cells against lenalidomide-treated
autologous MM targets (Fig. 1D).
Altogether, these data show that IMiDs treatment
of human MM cells enhances MICA and PVR/CD155
membrane expression by increasing their susceptibility to
NK cell recognition and killing.

To examine whether the upregulation of MICA and
PVR/CD155 membrane expression by IMiDs could be
associated with increased mRNA levels, total RNA was
isolated from SKO-007(J3) cells exposed to lenalidomide
or pomalidomide and analyzed by Real-Time qRT-PCR.
As shown in Fig. 2A (and Suppl. Fig. 4), we found a
significant increase of MICA and PVR/CD155 mRNA
levels in treated cells, whereas, in accordance with the
results at protein level, we did not detect any changes of
MICB transcripts. Moreover, similar results were obtained
in lenalidomide-treated MM cells isolated from three
different patients (Fig. 2B).

transcriptional level, we analyzed their effect on SKO007(J3) cells stably infected with a lentivirus carrying
a MICA or a PVR/CD155 5’-flank (promoter fragment)
upstream of a GLuc reporter gene. As shown in Fig.
2C, lenalidomide enhanced the activity of the reporter
gene driven by a 1.2 kb fragment of the mica or a 1.3 kb
fragment of the pvr gene promoter.
Thus, MICA and PVR/CD155 mRNA expression
and promoter activity are enhanced by IMiDs in MM cells.

infected SKO-007(J3) cells with a retrovirus expressing
IK6-DN along with GFP, an isoform of Ikaros lacking
the DNA binding domain and able to negatively interfere
with the activity of wild-type Ikaros family members [43,
44]. Flow cytometric analysis on these cells revealed a
significant increase of basal membrane expression of
MICA and PVR/CD155 as compared to cells infected
with an empty control vector (Suppl. Fig. 8A-8C). To
determine the effects of IK6-DN on the expression of
MICA and PVR/CD155 transcripts, GFP+ infected cells
were isolated by cell sorting, for RNA extraction and RealTime qRT-PCR analysis. Consistent with FACS analysis,
overexpression of IK6-DN was able to increase MICA
and PVR/CD155 basal mRNA levels (Suppl. Fig. 8D);
moreover, as observed in IKZF1 or IKZF3 silenced cells,
both MICB surface levels and transcripts were unaltered
by ectopic expression of IK6-DN. Accordingly, we also
observed significantly lower MICA and PVR/CD155
surface levels in wt-IKZF1-transduced 293T cells, that
express IKZF1 at very low levels (Suppl. Fig. 8E, 8F).
To examine possible inhibitory effects of these
transcription factors on mica and pvr promoter activity,
we performed transient transfection assays in 293T cells.
Regarding mica, a search for sequence homology revealed
two proximal putative Ikaros response elements in a region
spanning the first -270 bp of its promoter (Table 3). We
observed a significant repressive effect mediated by IKZF1
overexpression on the luciferase activity driven by a -270
bp 5’-flank of mica promoter. However, the inhibitory
effect of IKZF1 was significantly reduced on two mutated
versions of the -270 bp mica promoter (indicated as 270bp
MICA-DEL1 and 270bp MICA-DEL2), in which either
one putative Ikaros site was removed by site-directed
mutagenesis (Fig. 4A), thus indicating that binding of this
transcription factor to both sites is required for repression.
Regarding pvr, we used progressive deletions of
this promoter and delineated a fragment, spanning from
-470 bp to -343 bp (deletion PVR-A/PVR-B), responsive
to the inhibitory activity of this transcription factor and
containing a putative Ikaros consensus site (Fig. 4C).
Accordingly, we demonstrated the capability of
IKZF1 and IKZF3 proteins to directly bind to mica and
pvr promoters, in the regions encompassing these Ikaros
consensus sites by ChIP assays (Fig. 4B and 4D).
Finally, we did not observe any increase of ligand
expression in lenalidomide-treated SKO-007(J3) cells
overexpressing IKZF1-Q146H, a mutant form of Ikaros
incapable of binding CRBN and resistant to IMiDsmediated degradation [34] (Fig. 5A-5C), thus confirming
the repressive effect of IKZF1/3 on MICA and PVR/
CD155 expression, and indicating that IMiDs can blunt
this effect.

IMiDs-induced
MICA and
PVR/CD155
upregulation is CRBN-dependent and involves
IKZF1/3 transcription factors
To investigate the role of CRBN in MICA and
PVR/CD155 upregulation by IMiDs, we first treated
SKO-007(J3) cells with phthalimide, a thalidomide
analogue lacking the glutarimide moiety, the structural
component mediating binding to CRBN [32]. We did
not observe any changes in ligand expression on cells
exposed to phthalimide for 72h, also using doses two
times higher than those of lenalidomide, thus suggesting
the involvement of CRBN in these mechanisms (Suppl.
Fig. 5). Then, we tested whether the absence of CRBN
could modify IMiDs effects on ligand expression. To this
aim, we used a lentiviral vector expressing CRBN shRNA
to generate SKO-007(J3) cells with reduced expression of
this protein. Since stable CRBN depletion is cytotoxic for
myeloma cells [31], these experiments were performed
using transient infections. As shown in Fig. 3A-3C,
lenalidomide failed to augment MICA and PVR/CD155
levels in cells with reduced levels of CRBN.
In order to identify possible molecular mediators
involved in the upregulation of MICA and PVR/CD155
by IMiDs, we focused our attention on the role of the
transcription factors Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3),
recently identified as IMiDs-bound CRBN downstream
targets in MM cells [34-36].
We first confirmed the capability of lenalidomide and
pomalidomide to promote IKZF1 and IKZF3 degradation
in our experimental system (Suppl. Fig. 6A-6D); then,
we examined whether the absence of these proteins could
affect MICA and PVR/CD155 basal expression. To this
purpose, we infected SKO-007(J3) cells with lentiviral
vectors expressing IKZF1 or IKZF3 shRNAs along with
green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Suppl. Fig. 7A and 7B).
As shown in Fig. 3D-3G, by comparing ligand expression
of shRNA-transduced (GFP+) and shRNA-non-transduced
(GFP-) cells (Suppl. Fig. 7C), we could appreciate how
knockdown of IKZF1 or IKZF3 proteins was sufficient
to augment MICA and PVR/CD155 surface levels,
suggesting a repressive role of these transcription factors
on basal expression of these ligands in MM cells, whereas
the expression of MICB was not affected.

The transcription factor IRF4 inhibits MICA
expression in MM cells

These data indicate that in MM cells, IRF4 can
repress MICA expression both at protein and mRNA
levels.
To gain insight into the molecular mechanism(s)
that mediate the repressive activity of IRF4 on MICA
expression, we performed a structure/function analysis
of IRF4 by infecting SKO-007(J3) cells with retrovirus
expressing mutant forms of IRF4 and GFP. As shown in
Fig. 7A and B, ectopic expression of a truncated form of
IRF4 consisting of its N-terminal DNA binding domain
(IRF4 1-405) (GFP+ cells) was sufficient to specifically
increase MICA expression, presumably by competing with
and inhibiting the endogenous wild-type IRF4 function.
On the contrary, overexpression of the C-terminal
association domain of IRF4 (IRF4 403-1356) did not
affect either basal or lenalidomide-induced levels of this
ligand, suggesting that DNA binding activity of IRF4 is
necessary but not sufficient for MICA repression.
These observations indicate that IMiDs may involve
both IKZF1/3 proteins depletion and IRF4 downregulation
into increased MICA expression.
Interestingly, by analyzing the induction of ligands
at early times, treatment with lenalidomide was able to
increase MICA and PVR/CD155 mRNA levels as early
as 3 to 18 h (Fig. 8A and 8B), inducing IKZF1 and
IKZF3 degradation with no significant effect on IRF4
levels (Fig. 8C), thus suggesting that IKZF1/3 and IRF4
could contribute to MICA upregulation through a timesequential modulation of their expression.
Finally, knockdown of IRF4 did not modify either

An additional target of IMiDs in MM cells is IRF4,
a transcription factor positively regulated by IKZF1/3 and
inhibited by IMiDs/CRBN-mediated degradation of these
proteins [34-36].
We investigated its possible involvement in ligand
upregulation, as no evidence is available about a role of
this transcription factor in the regulation of MICA and
PVR/CD155 gene expression.
Consistent with other studies [34-36, 45], western
blot analysis confirmed a significant IRF4 downregulation
in SKO-007(J3) cells exposed to lenalidomide or
pomalidomide (24 to 72h) (Fig. 6A and Suppl. Fig. 9).
Therefore, we assessed the possible impact of direct
IRF4 depletion by shRNA interference (Fig. 6B) on
MICA and PVR/CD155 ligand expression. Since stable
IRF4 depletion is cytotoxic for myeloma cells [40], these
experiments were performed using transient infections.
Compared with non-targeting shRNA-infected
cells, IRF4 shRNA-transduced cells expressed higher
MICA surface levels, whereas MICB and PVR/CD155
membrane expression were unaffected (Fig. 6C).
Accordingly, Real-Time qRT-PCR analysis showed that
IRF4 silencing enhances only MICA mRNA expression
(Fig. 6D). Moreover, we observed that the increased
MICA membrane expression in IRF4 shRNA-transduced
cells could enhance their capability to stimulate NK cell
degranulation in an NKG2D-dependent manner (Fig. 6E).

We also identified a region of the pvr promoter
containing an Ikaros response element and interacting
with IKZF1 and IKZF3, supporting a direct involvement
of these proteins in the transcriptional regulation of
this ligand (Fig. 4C, 4D). Moreover, a site-directed
mutagenesis revealed the involvement of two different
proximal regions in the repression of mica promoter by
IKZF1/3, and ChIP analysis showed that both IKZF1 and
IKZF3 directly interact with this promoter in vivo (Fig.
4A, 4B). Interestingly, Ikaros consensus sites overlap a
region of mica promoter, previously identified as an heat
shock response element (HSE), critical for the induction
of this promoter, as well as micb promoter, by different
stress conditions via HSF1 activation [17, 50]. Of note,
mica and micb promoters are highly homologous, yet our
data indicate a different regulation of these ligands in MM
cells. Indeed, we did not observe a significant stimulatory
effect of IMiDs or IKZF1/3 silencing on MICB expression,
both at protein and mRNA levels, either in MM cell lines
or primary malignant plasma cells; a possible explanation
could be that Ikaros response elements are not conserved
in micb promoter (Table 3).
IMiDs can epigenetically regulate different genes in
MM cells [36, 51, 52], and histone deacetylase (HDAC)
or DNA methylation inhibitors can induce NKG2D ligand
expression in different cancer cells [53-56]; moreover, a
possible role of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation
of PVR/CD155 expression has been also described [57].
In this regard, IKZF1/3 transcription factors can promote
gene repression or activation through their ability to
recruit, via their C-terminus, a large number of nuclear
co-factors, including components of both HDAC and
ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes [58-60].
Thus, epigenetic modifications likely can contribute to
IKZF1/3-dependent repression of mica and pvr promoter
activity. Further experiments will be needed to address this
point.
In addition, our data indicate that mica promoter
activity can be also indirectly repressed by IKZF1/3
via IRF4 [34-36], another transcription factor emerged
in our study as a novel negative repressor of MICA
expression. Indeed, IRF4 silencing was sufficient, per sé,
to significantly and specifically increase MICA expression,
both at protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 6).
IRF4 can positively and negatively regulate different
genes, in part, by binding to distinct DNA-binding
motifs and through interaction with various additional
transcription factors [61]; its C-terminal transactivation
domain is critical for gene activation, while the
mechanisms responsible for gene repression are not well
defined.
Here, we demonstrated that the DNA binding
activity of IRF4 is necessary for its inhibitory role on
MICA expression (Fig. 7); in this regard, by computer
analysis of the hMICA 5’-flank, we could identify several
putative IRF4 binding sites. Our data tend to rule out a

IKZF1 or IKZF3 expression, while it could abolish the
expression of Blimp-1 (a known target used here as a
control) [46] (Fig. 8D), thus excluding the possibility that
the IRF4-mediated negative regulation of MICA might
indirectly depend on IKZF1/3 transcription factors [47].
Altogether, these observations identify the
transcription factor IRF4 as a novel negative regulator of
MICA gene expression in MM cells and provide evidence
that its downregulation contributes to MICA upregulation
by IMiDs.

DISCUSSION
IMiDs are highly effective drugs for the treatment
of MM and different biological activities are responsible
for their anti-myeloma properties [21, 22, 48, 49]. In
particular, a number of evidences in myeloma patients
describe the anti-tumor potential of NK cells in response
to IMiDs [19, 20, 23, 24], as well as the sensitization of
myeloma cells to NK cell-mediated lysis [27, 28].
In this study, we investigated the effects of IMiDs
on NK cell-activating ligand expression in MM cells. We
found a significant upregulation of MICA and PVR/CD155
mRNA and cell surface expression by lenalidomide and
pomalidomide; accordingly, NK-cell degranulation was
enhanced upon interaction with IMiDs-treated tumor cells.
IMiDs bind to CRBN, a component of the ubiquitin
ligase complex CLR4; the drug-CRBN interaction alters
its specificity to induce ubiquitylation and degradation of
several proteins, involved in the regulation of different
molecular pathways [34-36]. In this regard, the amount
of three different transcription factors, IKZF1, IKZF3
and IRF4 was widely described to decrease in MM cells
exposed to IMiDs.
Our findings demonstrate that IMiDs-CRBNIKZF1/3-IRF4 axis is critically involved in NK cellactivating ligand regulation by IMiDs in MM cells.
We show that CRBN knockdown can abrogate the
capacity of lenalidomide to increase MICA and PVR/
CD155 expression, further supporting the role of this
protein in anti-MM actions of this drug.
Moreover, we provide evidence that the transcription
factors IKZF1 and IKZF3 repress basal MICA and PVR/
CD155 expression in MM cells; our data indicate that
silencing of IKZF1 or IKZF3 by shRNA interference
(Fig. 3D-3G) or inhibition of their activity by IK6DN overexpression (Suppl. Fig. 8A-8D) is sufficient to
increase MICA and PVR/CD155 expression, both at
protein and mRNA levels.
IKZF1 and IKZF3 transcription factors are able to
bind the same regulatory elements of their target genes,
either as homo- or heterodimers [35, 38]. We observed
that knockdown of IKZF1 or IKZF3 results in a similar
increase of NK cell-activating ligand expression, thus
indicating that both transcription factors can suppress their
expression.

Reagents and antibodies

possible regulation of IKZF1 and IKZF3 proteins by
IRF4 (Fig. 8), and suggest that the repressive effect of this
transcription factor on MICA expression occurs via IKZF1
and IKZF3 independent mechanisms. Further studies will
be needed to better clarify a direct or indirect repressive
role of IRF4 on mica promoter.
In conclusion, we propose a model in which
IKZF1/3 can repress the constitutive expression of MICA
and PVR/CD155 expressed on MM cells, while IRF4 is
able to inhibit only MICA.
IMiDs promote the CRBN-dependent degradation
of IKZF1/3 proteins, leading to de-repression of pvr
promoter and to an initial de-repression of mica promoter,
further enhanced when also IRF4 is downregulated.
In this context, further experiments will be necessary
to investigate the possibility that these regulatory
mechanisms could be involved also in other cell lines (e.g.
lymphoma, AML, MDS).
These findings provide new insights on the immunomediated antitumor activities of IMiDs and further
elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate NK cellactivating ligand expression.

and protein extracts were prepared for the luciferase and
beta-galactosidase assays as already described in [65].
For MICA and PVR/CD155 lentiviral promoter vectors,
Gaussia luciferase and secreted Alkaline Phosphatase

Western-blot analysis
For Western-Blot analysis, SKO-007(J3) cells were
pelleted, washed once with cold phosphate-buffered
saline, resuspended in lysis buffer [1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v),
10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Sodium Deoxycholate, 1
mM phenyl-methyl-sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 mM
NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, complete protease inhibitor mixture
(Roche) in PBS] and subsequently incubated 30 min on
ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 14000g for 15 min
at 4°C and the supernatant was collected as whole cell
extract. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA
method (Pierce). Thirty to 50 µg of cell extract was run
on 12.5% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins
were then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes
(Schleicher&Schuell), stained with Ponceau to verify that
similar amounts of proteins had been loaded in each lane,
and blocked in 3% milk in TBST buffer. Immunoreactive
bands were visualized on the nitrocellulose membranes,
using horseradish-peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit or
goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins and the ECL detection
system (GE Healthcare Amersham), following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Antibodies against β-actin,
IRF4 (H-140), Ikaros (H-100) and Aiolos (L-15) were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody
against Blimp-1 was purchased from Cell Signaling.

Statistics
Error bars represent SD. Data were evaluated by
paired Student t test and a level of P< 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
