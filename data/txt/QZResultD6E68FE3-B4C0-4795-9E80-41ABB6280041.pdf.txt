BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–targeted therapies are standard treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma
(mRCC); however, toxicities can lead to drug discontinuation, which can affect patient outcomes. This study was aimed at identifying risk
factors for toxicity and constructing the first model to predict toxicity-related treatment discontinuation (TrTD) in mRCC patients treated
with VEGF-targeted therapies. METHODS: The baseline characteristics, treatment outcomes, and toxicity data were collected for 936
mRCC patients receiving first-line VEGF-targeted therapy from the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium. A competing risk regression model was used to identify risk factors for TrTD, and it accounted for other causes as competing
risks. RESULTS: Overall, 198 (23.8%) experienced TrTD. Sunitinib was the most common VEGF-targeted therapy (77%), and it was
followed by sorafenib (18.4%). The median time on therapy was 7.1 months for all patients and 4.4 months for patients with TrTD.
The most common toxicities leading to TrTD included fatigue, diarrhea, and mucositis. In a multivariate analysis, significant predictors
for TrTD were a baseline age 60 years, a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, a single metastatic site, and a
sodium level <135 mmol/L. A risk group model was developed that used the number of patient risk factors to predict the risk of
TrTD. CONCLUSIONS: In the largest series to date, age, GFR, number of metastatic sites, and baseline sodium level were found to
be independent risk factors for TrTD in mRCC patients receiving VEGF-targeted therapy. Based on the number of risk factors present,

INTRODUCTION
Clinical outcomes in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) have vastly improved with the discovery of agents that target
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (vascular endothelial growth factor receptors). Historically,
immunotherapy with interleukin-2 and interferon-a was the established treatment for patients with advanced renal cell
carcinoma, but it produced only a modest response.1 VEGF-targeted therapies, including sunitinib (Pfizer, Inc, New
York, NY), sorafenib (Bayer Pharmaceuticals, Wayne, NJ), bevacizumab (Genentech, Inc, San Francisco, Calif), pazopanib (GlaxoSmithKline, Triangle Park, NC), and axitinib (Pfizer), have shown an improvement in response rates and
progression-free survival in phase 3 clinical trials.2-6 Because of their significant antitumor activity, VEGF-targeted therapies are now the standard of care for the treatment of mRCC.

Original Article

With more than 10 years of experience with the use
of anti-VEGF therapies, there is an increased understanding of the toxicity profiles associated with these agents,
which clinicians must appropriately manage to effectively
and safely treat patients. Accumulating safety data have
demonstrated increases in the incidence and severity of
toxicities associated with VEGF-targeted therapies.7-9
Unfortunately, these toxicities often lead to dose reductions, interruptions, and discontinuations, which can
have a negative impact on renal cell carcinoma patients,
who are living longer and will receive several subsequent
therapies through the course of their disease.9,10 Real-life
experience in clinical practice has identified an increased
incidence of toxicity-related treatment discontinuation
(TrTD) associated with VEGF-targeted therapies in comparison with initial reports from clinical trials.11-14 The
careful characterization of patients who are at increased
risk for severe toxicities and TrTD can help to establish
expectations for patients and physicians and allow more
aggressive prophylactic measures to prevent toxicity in
high-risk patients. It can assist clinicians in providing clinical benefits from anti-VEGF therapies without compromising patients’ quality of life.
We examined mRCC patients treated with first-line
VEGF-targeted therapies in a large, multicenter study to
characterize the possible predictive factors associated with
TrTD. We used these predictive factors to construct a
model that defines risk groups for mRCC patients receiving anti-VEGF therapies as a tool for providers to use in
clinical practice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Populations

The International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) is a consecutive patient series
from institutions in North America, Europe, and Asia.
The series includes mRCC patients of all ages and histological subtypes who, starting in 2003, received first-line
targeted therapy. For the current study, 7 IMDC centers
participated and collected data on reasons for treatment
discontinuation for a total of 943 patients. Seven patients
were excluded: 1 was treated with mammalian target of
rapamycin inhibitor, and 6 had incomplete treatment
data. This left 936 patients for the analysis.
Baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory data
were retrospectively collected for all patients with uniform
database templates to ensure consistent data collection.
Laboratory values were standardized against institutional
upper limits of normal and lower limits of normal when

appropriate. We used standard cutoffs for the glomerular
filtration rate (GFR) to calculate kidney function as suggested by the National Kidney Foundation for the staging
of chronic kidney disease.15 Toxicities leading to dose
modification and treatment discontinuation were retrospectively collected by patient chart review at each center.
Survival data were collected from patient medical records
or publicly available records. Institutional review board
approval was obtained from each participating center.
Statistical Analysis

Patient baseline characteristics were summarized as the
numbers and percentages of patients or as the medians
and ranges of values. Distributions of overall survival and
time on therapy were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier
methodology.
The primary outcome of this study was the time to
treatment failure due to toxicity, which was defined as the
time period between treatment initiation and discontinuation due to toxicity. The cumulative incidence of TrTD
was estimated with a competing risk model in which treatment discontinuation due to progression (radiographic
criteria from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors), death, or other reasons was considered a competing risk, and patients were censored at the last followup visit if they were still on therapy. Patients with an
unknown reason for treatment discontinuation (n 5 35
or 3.7%) were also included in the analysis and were combined with the “other reason” category.
With the competing risk regression model, the subdistribution hazard ratio (HR) of TrTD was reported
along with the 95% confidence interval (CI). Gray’s test
was used to compare the cumulative incidence of TrTD
by patient baseline characteristics in both univariate and
multivariable models.16 To construct the multivariable
model, we used the backward procedure based on Bayesian Information Criterion for competing risk data
(BICcr), a modified Bayesian information criterion for
competing risk data for variable selection17; all variables
identified in the univariate analysis with a probability
threshold <.1 were used. The case-deletion method was
used to handle missing values for all explanatory variables.
Once the risk factors were identified and the final
model was formed, we internally validated parameter estimates of the final model with 500 bootstrap samples,
which were generated randomly from the original study
population. For each of the samples, we refit the competing risk regression model with the variables selected in the
final model, and we calculated the subdistribution HRs as
in the original analysis. The bootstrap mean and CI (based

computed and compared with the model using the original study population.
On the basis of the final risk factor model, we also
built a risk group variable by counting the number of
unfavorable features present for each patient. Model discrimination was evaluated with time-dependent areas
under the curve (AUCs) for censored event times with
competing risks.18 The 95% CI of a time-dependent
AUC was estimated by the bootstrap method. The statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute,

2011. Patient characteristics are depicted in Table 1.
The majority of the patients were treated with sunitinib
(n 5 720 or 76.9%), which was followed by sorafenib
(n 5 172 or 18.4%), bevacizumab (n 5 36 or 3.8%), and
pazopanib (n 5 8 or 0.9%). Of the 833 patients who discontinued treatment, 198 (23.8%) did so because of toxicity. Additional reasons for treatment discontinuation
included progression (n 5 435), death (n 5 68), other/
patient choice (n 5 97), and unknown (n 5 35). The estimated cumulative incidence of TrTD was 9.1% (95% CI,
7.3%-11.1%), 13.3% (95% CI, 11.2%-15.6%), and
17.8% (95% CI, 15.4%-20.4%) at 3, 6, and 12 months,
respectively. The cumulative incidence at 12 months was
17% (95% CI, 14%-20%) for sunitinib and 23% (95%
CI, 17.1%-30%) for sorafenib.
Overall, the median time on therapy was 7.1 months
for all patients and 4.4 months for patients who had
TrTD (range, 0.1-69.8 months). The median overall survival was 21.2 months (95% CI, 19.0-23.4 months). The
median follow-up of surviving patients (n 5 398 or 43%)
was 22.6 months.
Fatigue (n 5 35 or 4%), diarrhea (n 5 19 or 2%),
and decreased appetite (n 5 17 or 2%) were the
most common types of adverse effects that led to TrTD
(Table 2). There were 589 patients from 6 centers that
had reported on dose reductions, and 274 of these patients
(47%) required a dose reduction during treatment with
VEGF-targeted therapy. The median time to a dose
reduction was 2.8 months (n 5 274; range, 0.1-44.6
months). The most common reasons for dose reduction
included fatigue (n 5 73 or 12%), hand-foot skin
reaction (n 5 58 or 10%), and mucositis (n 5 39 or 7%;

Univariate and Multivariable Models

The baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables, including those previously found to have prognostic
value, that were used in the univariate analysis are shown
in Table 3. Female sex (P 5 .0035), older age (P <.0001),
severe renal insufficiency (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2;
P 5 .0002), a single site of metastasis (P 5 .006), and a
low baseline sodium level (P 5 .006) were significant predictors of TrTD. Notably, the initial GFR analysis did
not find a significant difference between the group with a
GFR of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and the group with a
GFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; thus, the 2 groups were subsequently combined in the analysis (HR, 1.27; P 5 .13).
It was found that if patients were classified into 2 groups
with a cutoff of 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 versus <60 mL/min/
1.73 m2, the association still held but to a lesser degree (HR,
1.40; P 5 .02). Therefore, we decided to choose <30 and
30 mL/min/1.73 m2 as the cutoffs in the model because
they had the strongest association.
In the final multivariable model, 4 of the risk factors
identified in the univariate analysis were independent
predictors of TrTD. They included a baseline GFR <30
mL/min/1.73 m2 (HR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.19-4.06; P 5
.0122), a single metastatic site (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.102.05; P 5 .0096), a baseline sodium level <135 mmol/L
(HR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.19-2.74; P 5 .0056), and an older
age (HR for an age of 60-69 vs <60 years, 1.79; 95% CI,
414

1.23-2.59; P 5 .0022; HR for an age 70 vs <60 years,
3.09; 95% CI, 2.10-4.53; P <.0001; Table 4). Bootstrap
analyses produced very similar HRs and confirmed the
high internal validity of these results (Table 4). Figure 1
shows the cumulative incidence of TrTD according to
each of the 4 risk factors. The cumulative incidence of
treatment failure due to reasons other than toxicity is
shown in Supporting Figure 1 (see online supporting
information).
Risk Groups

A model was developed according to the 4 significant risk
factors to predict TrTD (Table 5). According to the number of risk factors present, patients were stratified into 3
risk groups. Patients were considered at low risk for TrTD
if they had 0 or 1 risk factor (n 5 516 or 63%), at intermediate risk for TrTD if they had 2 risk factors (n 5 208
or 25%), and at high risk if 3 or 4 risk factors were present
(n 5 95 or 12%). Notably, patients were counted as having 1 risk factor for an age of 60 to 69 years and as having
2 risk factors for an age 70 years. A double weight was
given to the 70-year-old group because the regression
coefficient was double for this risk group in comparison
with the other risk factors. When patients were segregated
into the 3 risk categories, the cumulative probability
of TrTD at 1 year was 0.11 (95% CI, 0.08-0.14), 0.25
(95% CI, 0.19-0.31), and 0.40 (95% CI, 0.30-0.49) in

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date to identify predictive risk factors and develop a model for TrTD
in mRCC patients treated with VEGF-targeted therapies
in routine practice. Our study represents real-life experience with targeted agents in mRCC. We found that in
this population, 23.8% of the patients discontinued treatment, and 47% underwent a dose reduction due to drug

toxicity. Although adverse event attribution is not always
reported in clinical trials, the rates of adverse event discontinuation and reduction in the pivotal renal cell carcinoma
trials of VEGF-targeted therapies were typically lower
(range for discontinuation, 10%-24%; range for reduction, 13%-51%).2-4,19-21
A small, single-center, retrospective study by Van
der Veldt et al22 investigated the prediction of severe toxicity with sunitinib in mRCC. In that study, the rate of
dose reductions due to drug toxicity was 43%, which is
similar to what was reported in our analysis (47%). In
addition, the most common reasons for dose reduction,
including fatigue, hand-foot skin reaction, and mucositis,
were consistent between the studies. The comparable
patient populations of Van der Veldt et al’s study and our
study in terms of sex, age, performance status, histology,
and prior nephrectomy may explain the similar dose

reduction outcomes and the increased rates in comparison
with the pivotal trials with preselected patients. In a multivariate analysis, Van der Veldt et al’s study found female
sex and higher age to be predictive factors of severe toxicity, which was defined as TrTD or a reduction. In our
analysis, we chose to specifically analyze the impact of
TrTD because patients can still obtain a clinical benefit
from reduced-dose treatment; therefore, dose discontinuation may have the greatest impact on treatment outcomes.23 Our analysis also found older age to be a
predictive factor of TrTD, and although female sex was a
significant predictor in the univariate analysis, the association was not significant in the multivariable model (HR,
1.33; 95% CI, 0.96-1.85; P 5 .089). Notably, the rate of
hyponatremia was significantly higher in females versus
males (17% vs 10%). Because of the correlation between
the 2 covariates, sex could not provide an independent
prediction value when hyponatremia, a more significant
predictor, was included in the multivariable analysis. This
was confirmed in a sensitivity analysis in which hyponatremia was excluded from the multivariable model, and
the adjusted HR for sex increased to 1.51 (95% CI, 1.102.07; P 5 .011) with adjustments for other risk factors.
Pharmacokinetic studies of sunitinib and sorafenib found
no clinically relevant differences in sex to warrant dose
adjustments, and sorafenib phase 3 trials found no differences in toxicity.24,25 However, bevacizumab was found
to have pharmacokinetic variability based on sex.26
Although sex has not appeared to affect the efficacy of
VEGF-targeted therapies,25 further research should be
performed to determine the true impact of sex on toxicity.
Older age was a predictive factor for TrTD in our
study. Previous studies have established older age as a risk
factor for increased chemotherapy toxicity, and current
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines specifically recommend an assessment of geriatric patients
before treatment.27-30 Older age has not been shown to
affect the efficacy of VEGF-targeted therapies; however,
an increased incidence of toxicity in these patients has
been reported.31-36 In addition, this patient population is

more likely to have comorbidities that can affect the tolerability of therapy.37 Although the impact of older age on
toxicity is established, there continue to be inconsistencies
about which actual age defines an elderly patient. Our
analysis has found that the risk of TrTD increases with
age, and the hazards are 1.8- and 3.1-fold higher for those
60 and 70 years old, respectively.
A low baseline sodium level is known to be associated with a shorter time to treatment failure from all
causes and poorer overall survival,38-40 and it was an independent predictor of treatment failure due to toxicity in
our study. Hyponatremia in mRCC may be related to
chronic inflammation or preexisting comorbidities, and
this possibly may make the delivery of targeted agents
challenging. These areas need to be explored to fully
understand the implications of low sodium levels for
mRCC patients.
Data on the use of VEGF-targeted therapies in the
context of renal insufficiency are limited. Some studies
have shown that this comorbidity does not have a negative
impact on survival and response outcomes.41-43 Our data
are consistent with those reported by Poprach et al,42 who
found that patients with more severe renal dysfunction
had an increased incidence of TrTD. Although
VEGF-targeted therapies used for mRCC are not renally
eliminated, there are some side effects that are more pronounced in patients with renal dysfunction.44,45 Thus far,
no significant pharmacokinetic differences have been
observed with VEGF-targeted therapies in the context of
renal insufficiency.35,45,46 A more robust study of patients
with severe renal dysfunction (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73
m2) may clarify differences in mRCC patients treated
with VEGF-targeted therapies.
The number of metastatic sites was found to be an
independent predictor of poor outcomes and was incorporated into an extended Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center model for survival in patients with previously
untreated mRCC.47 Our analysis interestingly found that
patients with more than 1 metastasis indeed had a higher
risk of treatment failure from progression, but they also
had a lower risk of treatment failure due to toxicity (Supporting Fig. 1 [see online supporting information]). The
dichotomous results may be explained by the time on
therapy. Patients with an increased disease burden progress quickly and are thus less likely to stop therapy for
other reasons, including toxicity. This highlights the importance of modeling toxicity-related treatment failure in
the presence of competing risks, as was done in our
analysis.

With the growing experience in the treatment of
mRCC with VEGF-targeted therapies, reports on the
incidence and management of their toxicities are abundant. However, evidence for identifying a patient’s risk of
toxicities and his or her ability to tolerate these medications is still lacking. The model derived in this study can
better stratify patients and provide information to providers to make personalized treatment decisions. It can set
patient expectations and offer clinicians an opportunity to
provide aggressive monitoring, better patient education of
toxicities and management, and dose adjustments for
those with persistent toxicities to reduce the need for treatment discontinuation. This analysis has provided some
insight into the importance of tolerability of VEGFtargeted therapies in routine practice. We demonstrated
that a significant number of patients had to discontinue
treatment prematurely because of drug toxicity; they spent
a median of 2.7 months less on therapy in comparison
with those who did not discontinue treatment prematurely. The median overall survival was 19.4 months
(95% CI, 15.5-23.9 months) among patients who
stopped because of toxicity. The use of this model to identify patients at risk of developing toxicity in conjunction
with increased patient education and monitoring is the
initial step that providers can take for patients to fully benefit from treatment. Further studies of modified doses and
schedules of VEGF-targeted therapies for high-risk
patients can provide insight into the optimal use of
VEGF-targeted agents in this patient population.
There were some limitations due to the retrospective
nature of this study. Data on dose adjustment patterns,
concomitant medications, race, and other patient comorbidities that may have provided more insight into this
analysis were not available. Although this may not have
affected our model, it may have supplied more information on confounding factors for toxicity and effective dosing strategies. With patient collection until 2011,
pazopanib and axitinib were not well represented in this
analysis. They share the same dose-limiting toxicities that
can cause TrTD; however, further analysis with more
patients on pazopanib and axitinib must be performed to
confirm the conclusions of this study for patients on all
anti-VEGF therapies used for mRCC. Lastly, the model
was internally validated but has yet to be validated externally. The strengths of our study include the large cohort
of unselected patients and the analysis of several known
factors that have previously had prognostic value in
mRCC.
In conclusion, we have established a set of predictive
factors for TrTD as part of a model that can be used in

practice to identify patients who can benefit from aggressive monitoring and treatment adjustments to decrease
the risk of toxicity and maintain the effectiveness of
treatment.
