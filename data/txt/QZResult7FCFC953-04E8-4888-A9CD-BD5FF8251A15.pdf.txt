Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most deadly cancers worldwide. Although many
regimens have been used for PDAC treatment, the combination of the EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibitor erlotinib
with gemcitabine has been the only molecular-targeted drug tested so far that has been superior to gemcitabine
alone. The mechanism underlying this effective combinational regimen remains unknown. Here, we show that the
combination is superior to gemcitabine alone in blocking progression and prolonging survival in a murine model
of PDAC (Kras activation with Tgfbr2 knockout). We found that gemcitabine induced mitogen-activated protein
kinase signaling, which was dramatically inhibited by erlotinib even in the Kras-activated PDAC cells in the mouse
model. Mechanistic investigations suggested that gemcitabine induces EGFR ligand expression and ERBB2
activation by increasing heterodimer formation with EGFR, thereby maintaining high levels of ERBB2 protein in
PDAC cells. Overall, our ﬁndings suggest a signiﬁcant role of ERBB in PDAC treatment. Cancer Res; 73(7); 2221–34.

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the
leading causes of cancer death in Japan and worldwide, with a
5-year survival rate of less than 5% for all stages combined (1–
3). Most patients are already unresectable when diagnosed,
and even after successful resection, the cancers frequently
relapse. In addition, PDAC is highly resistant to conventional
chemotherapy regimens. Although molecular-targeted drugs
have been extensively evaluated in a number of clinical trials,
EGF receptor (EGFR) inhibitor erlotinib in combination with
gemcitabine was the only regimen using molecular target
agents that showed prolonged survival compared with gemcitabine alone (4). The impact of clinical beneﬁt previously
reported appears relatively small; however, considering that
almost no regimens have shown any statistically signiﬁcant
beneﬁts compared with gemcitabine in PDAC, this is one of the

important options in this ﬁeld. Moreover, erlotinib has just
been approved by the government in Japan as a formal regimen
for the treatment of PDAC. Therefore, understanding the
detailed mechanisms whereby erlotinib shows an efﬁcacy on
PDAC in combination with gemcitabine is gaining more
signiﬁcance.
The predictive factors for treatment with EGFR inhibitor
have been established in some cancers. In metastatic colorectal
cancer, EGFR inhibition beneﬁts only the KRAS wild-type
patients (5, 6). In non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), patients
with activating EGFR mutation have shown better response
and survival (7, 8). With regard to PDAC, previous studies
reported that the overall rate of EGFR expression was 30% to
70% (9, 10), and no obvious impact of EGFR expression on
outcome was observed (4, 10). Activating EGFR mutations have
rarely been reported in human PDAC. Moreover, as a majority
of patients with PDAC carry downstream KRAS mutations (11,
12), it is difﬁcult to explain why upstream EGFR inhibition has a
beneﬁcial effect on the PDAC.
Recently, by using pancreas-speciﬁc conditional activation
or knockout of clinically relevant PDAC-related genes and
signaling pathways, genetically engineered murine PDAC progression models have been described (13–17). Previous studies
reported that the genetically engineered models can recapitulate clinical tumor microenvironment better than xenograft
tumor models and also can recapitulate the survival effect of
clinical trials of human patients (18, 19).
We have already established pancreas-speciﬁc TGF-b receptor II (Tgfbr2) knockout mice in the context of Kras activation
(KrasG12DþTgfbr2KO; ref. 13). The clinical and histopathologic
manifestations of the mice recapitulated human PDAC.

This model histologically show differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma with abundant stromal components including desmoplastic reaction, but not sarcomatoid or undifferentiated
tumors, which are rare in human pancreatic cancer and were
reported in other genetically engineered models (13). With
regard to TGF-b signaling, SMAD4 gene mutation or deletion is
frequently observed in human patients with PDAC (20); however, mice containing Smad4 knockout with the Kras activation
in the pancreas were reported to show cystic tumors of the
pancreas, distinct precancer lesions from pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasm, or mucious cystic neoplasm (21–23). Therefore, our
KrasG12DþTgfbr2KO might be the closest approximation of the
human PDAC in terms of histology that can be expected to
recapitulate response to the therapy.
In the present study, we investigated the mode of action of
gemcitabine and erlotinib in vivo using the KrasG12DþTgfbr2KO
model and propose mechanisms explaining why PDAC with
extremely frequent KRAS mutation beneﬁts from the EGFR
inhibitor in combination with gemcitabine.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Gemcitabine was purchased from Eli Lilly Japan. Erlotinib
was purchased from Chugai Pharmaceutical. An MEK inhibitor, PD0325901, was purchased from WAKO.
Mouse colonies and treatment with reagents
Tgfbr2ﬂox/ﬂox (24), Ptf1acre/þ (25), and LSL-KrasG12D/þ (26) were
described previously. The 3 lines were intercrossed to generate
Ptf1acre/þ;LSL-KrasG12D/þ;Tgfbr2ﬂox/ﬂox
(KrasG12DþTgfbr2KO)
on >95% C57BL/6 background(13). All of the experimental
protocols were approved by the ethics committee for animal
experimentation and conducted in accordance with the
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of
the Graduate School of Medicine, the University of Tokyo
(Tokyo, Japan).
The KrasG12DþTgfbr2KO mice were treated with vehicle,
gemcitabine, and gemcitabine þ erlotinib (n ¼ 9–11, each)
for the survival experiment. For the histologic and biochemical
analyses, mice (n ¼ 3–4 each group) were treated and euthanized at 7 weeks of age, the pancreas was excised, the long and
short diameter of tumors was measured, and ﬁxed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS or frozen. Details are described in
Supplementary Methods.
Cell lines
The cell lines were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection or the RIKEN Cell Bank and passaged in
our laboratory for fewer than 6 months after resuscitation.
Mouse pancreatic cancer cell lines (K375, K399) were established from KrasG12DþTgfbr2KO mice, and mouse pancreatic
ﬁbroblast (K643f) was established from the Kras alone-activated mice as described previously (13, 27).
Cell growth assays
The cell lines were treated with erlotinib, gemcitabine (0–10
mmol/L) for 48 hours in serum-containing media. MTT solu-

tion (Sigma) was added to each well to a ﬁnal concentration of
0.1 mg/mL, and plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37 C. Then,
the formazan crystals were dissolved with EtOH and absorbance was read at 570 nm.
Western blotting, immunoprecipitation
Mouse pancreatic tumors and the cells were homogenized
with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. In immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer and
subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis. Details are
described in Supplementary Methods.
Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
Details are described in Supplementary Methods.
ELISA
The cells were treated with vehicle or gemcitabine
(10 nmol/L) for 24 hours in serum-containing media and cell
culture media were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 minutes at
4 C, and the supernatants were subjected to the ELISA (Ray
Biotech, Inc). Pancreatic tumors from the treated mice were
homogenized with lysis buffer (Raybiotech, Inc) and centrifuged at 15,000  g for 15 minutes at 4 C and the supernatants
were also subjected to the ELISA.
Flow cytometry
The cells suspended in PBS were incubated in propidium
iodide solution (Dojindo Laboratories, 50 mg/mL in PBS) for 30
minutes. The cells were then analyzed for cell-cycle status
using the Guava EasyCyte Plus (Guava Technologies). Annexin
assay (Guava annexin kit; Millipore) was conducted according
to the manufacture's protocol.
Phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase antibody array
Mouse phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) antibody
array (R&D Systems) analysis was conducted according to the
manufacturer's instructions. A total of 250 mg of lysates from
the treated PDAC tissues at 7 weeks of age were subjected to
analysis. The densitometric data after subtraction of background density were normalized by those of positive controls
on each membrane and compared between the treatment
groups.
Histology and immunohistochemsitry
Mouse tissues was harvested and processed as described
previously (13). The slides with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E)
staining were subjected to histologic analysis. Immunohistochemistry was conducted as described previously (28).
Details are described in Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
Except when indicated, quantitative data were shown as
mean  SD, and the 2-sided Student t test was used for
statistical analysis, with P < 0.05 taken as signiﬁcant. The
IC50 and the combination index (CI), indicating that the
interaction of the drugs was calculated by CalcuSyn software.
Log-rank test was used to determine the survival signiﬁcance.

Results
Erlotinib inhibits the KrasG12D þ Tgfbr2KO PDAC
progression and prolongs survival of the PDAC mice in
combination with gemcitabine
We ﬁrst evaluated the survival of the KrasG12DþTgfbr2KO
PDAC mice by treating with gemcitabine, erlotinib, and gemcitabine þ erlotinib (Fig. 1A). Median survival times were 52.5,
69, 61, and 74 days for control, gemcitabine alone, erlotinib
alone, and gemcitabine þ erlotinib group, respectively (Fig.
1B). Log-rank test comparing the 2 groups, a standard chemoreagent gemcitabine alone signiﬁcantly extended the survival compared with the control (P ¼ 0.046). Furthermore,
adding erlotinib to gemcitabine prolonged the survival significantly compared with gemcitabine alone (P ¼ 0.0095). We also
evaluated survival efﬁcacy of erlotinib alone, which revealed
that erlotinib alone extended the survival compared with the
control (P ¼ 0.0005) and gemcitabine þ erlotinib further
prolonged the survival compared with the erlotinib alone
(P ¼ 0.0006).
When dissected at 7 weeks of age, vehicle-treated PDACs
were so large that they occupied the entire pancreas, whereas gemcitabine þ erlotinib-treated PDACs showed focal
nodules in the pancreas. Gemcitabine-treated PDACs were
intermediate, some occupied the entire pancreas and some
were focal. The proportion of tumor area to total pancreas

tissue of gemcitabine þ erlotinib–treated PDACs seemed
smaller than that of vehicle-treated PDACs (Fig. 1C and D),
although the difference did not reach a statistical signiﬁcance (P ¼ 0.092). There was no metastasis at 7 weeks of age
in this mouse model.
H&E staining showed that the KrasG12D þ Tgfbr2KO PDAC
tissues were basically well-differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma with rich stromal components and also contained poorly
differentiated and invasive ductal adenocarcinoma (Fig. 1E).
The quantiﬁcation of remaining normal pancreas area conﬁrmed a statistical difference between the gemcitabine þ
erlotinib group and the control group, as well as the gemcitabine þ erlotinib group and the gemcitabine group (Fig. 1F).
The tumor area on the microscope was almost consistent with
that judged macroscopically. There were no apparent pathologic differences such as grade of malignancy between tumor
tissues with or without gemcitabine, whereas gemcitabine þ
erlotinib–treated PDACs were less frequent poorly differentiated PDACs (Fig. 1E).

and CFPAC-1). Erlotinib inhibited the growth of all PDAC
cells, irrespective of their human or mouse origin, although
most of them except for BxPC-3 contained constitutively
active KRAS mutation (Fig. 2A). A ﬂow cytometric analysis
showed that erlotinib induced G1 arrest in mouse PDAC cells
(K375; Fig. 2B). Immunoblot analysis showed that erlotinib
affected endogenous intracellular signaling and inhibited
phosphorylation of EGFR, MEK, and extracellular signal–
regulated kinase (ERK). Erlotinib also inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 and AKT at higher concentrations (Fig. 2C
and D). We next treated the PDAC cells with EGF. Although
the K375, K399, Capan-1, and CFPAC-1 contained the KRAS
mutation, we observed that EGF treatment dramatically
induced phosphorylation of EGFR, ERK, and AKT in all the
cells irrespective of KRAS mutation status and erlotinib
clearly inhibited the phosphorylation (Fig. 2D and E). STAT3

(Fig. 3A).
Immunoblot analysis of mouse PDAC tissue lysates showed
that gemcitabine activated phosphorylation of Erk (Fig. 3B).
Furthermore, erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine inhibited the phosphorylation. In the gemcitabine alone–treated
group, the mice with larger pancreatic tumors (457, 988)
showed strong expression of Egfr and strong phosphorylation
of Erk. Erlotinib also diminished the total protein level of Egfr.
There were no apparent differences in the inﬂammatory cell

gemcitabine or in combination with erlotinib (data not

Gemcitabine activates the phosphorylation of ERK in
PDAC cells, which is inhibited by adding erlotinib in vitro
We examined whether gemcitabine and erlotinib affected
the intracellular signaling of PDAC cells in vitro. First, we
examined the cell viability and showed that adding erlotinib
to gemcitabine synergistically inhibited the growth of
mouse and human PDAC cells (K375 and BxPC-3; Fig. 4A
and B, Supplementary Table S1). In mouse PDAC cells, we
detected that gemcitabine alone activated phosphorylation
of Erk and Mek, which was inhibited by adding erlotinib
(Fig. 4C). The gemcitabine-induced Erk phosphorylation
was observed in a time-dependent manner for 0 to 24
hours (Fig. 4D).

Gemcitabine induces the expression of EGFR ligands in
PDAC cells
To examine the mechanism of gemcitabine-induced activation of EGFR/ERK, we evaluated the effect of gemcitabine
on the expression of EGFR ligands in vitro. Relative RNA
levels of amphiregulin, TGF-a, and EGF after incubation
with gemcitabine were determined by real-time quantitative
PCR. In the murine PDAC cells K375, Tgf-a and Egf

were signiﬁcantly elevated and amphiregulin also seemed
to be elevated after gemcitabine treatment, whereas in the
murine ﬁbroblast, K643f gemcitabine did not affect the
expression of Egfr ligands (Fig. 5A). In the human PDAC
cells (Capan-1, CFPAC-1), amphiregulin, TGF-a, and EGF
were all signiﬁcantly elevated after gemcitabine treatment
(Fig. 5B). Next, we conducted ELISA for EGFR ligands.
In murine PDAC lysates, amphiregulin and Egf were

signiﬁcantly elevated in gemcitabine-treated PDACs compared with vehicle-treated ones (Fig. 5C). In the human
PDAC cells (BxPC-3), amphiregulin and TGF-a were significantly elevated after gemcitabine treatment. TGF-awas also
signiﬁcantly elevated after gemcitabine treatment in Capan1 and CFPAC-1 (Fig. 5D and data not shown). Thus, the
EGFR ligands upregulation can explain the gemcitabineinduced EGFR/ERK activation.
We observed that gemcitabine induced the PDAC cell
apoptosis and adding EGF reduced the apoptosis in ﬂow
cytometry, which suggested that the gemcitabine-induced
EGFR ligand upregulation might be associated with antiapoptotic response of the PDAC cells against gemcitabine (Supplementary Fig. S1). There might be release of EGFR ligands from
dying cells by chemotherapy; however, we observed the upregulation of the ligands at mRNA levels, which indicated that the
response was derived from live PDAC cells.
Gemcitabine induces activation of Erbb2 in the KrasG12D
þ Tgfbr2KO PDAC mouse model
We assessed whether RTKs other than EGFR were activated
in response to gemcitabine by using a phospho-RTK antibody
array, which contained 39 RTKs. We compared 4 groups of
mouse pancreatic tissue lysates; vehicle-treated, gemcitabinetreated with low Egfr expression, gemcitabine-treated with
high Egfr expression, and gemcitabine þ erlotinib–treated. The
Egfr phosphorylation in the gemcitabine-treated group with
high Egfr expression was inhibited in combination with erlotinib. Most notably, phospho-Erbb2 was more strongly induced
than phospho-Egfr in gemcitabine-treated group and was
almost completely inhibited in combination with erlotinib
(Fig. 6A and B). The array also showed Erbb4 induction
by gemcitabine, which was also inhibited by adding erlotinib
(Fig. 6A and B).
We evaluated this result by immunoblot analysis. The
expression and phosphorylation of Erbb2 were found to
be increased in the gemcitabine-treated mice and adding
erlotinib inhibited the induction (Fig. 6C). The Erbb2 expression pattern was also conﬁrmed by immunohistochemistry
(Fig. 6D).
Gemcitabine induces Erbb2 protein level and a
heterodimer formation with Egfr in the PDAC cells in
vitro, which is diminished by adding erlotinib
We observed that gemcitabine treatment increased the total
protein level and phosphorylation of Erbb2, which
was inhibited by adding erlotinib in the PDAC cells in vitro
(Fig. 7A). Next we examined an effect of gemcitabine and
erlotinib on heterodimer formation of Egfr with Erbb2 in the
PDAC cells. Immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the
heterodimer formation of Egfr with Erbb2 was enhanced by
gemcitabine treatment and inhibited in combination with
erlotinib (Fig. 7B). Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
(RT-PCR) showed that gemcitabine treatment induced Egfr
and Erbb2 expression in the PDAC cells (K375) at transcriptional level, which was further induced by adding erlotinib in
vitro (Fig. 7C). Immunoblotting showed that gemcitabine þ
erlotinib clearly decreased the protein level of Erbb2 (Fig. 7D),

www.aacrjournals.org

suggesting that erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine
might induce degradation of Erbb2 protein but does not inhibit
Erbb2 transcription in the PDAC cells. Thus, we propose that
gemcitabine activated Erbb2 by increasing the total protein
level and also heterodimerization with Egfr. Both were inhibited by adding erlotinib.
Gemcitabine-induced EGFR/ErbB2-MAPK signal
activation is also dependent on active MAPK signaling
To assess whether the effect of gemcitabine on EGFR/ErbB2
activation is secondary to MAPK signal activation, we evaluated the effect of MEK inhibition. We observed that adding
MEK inhibitor (PD0325901) reduced the gemcitabine-induced
activation of EGFR and ErbB2 in the PDAC cells (K375;
Supplementary Fig. S2). Adding PD0325901 to gemcitabine
also reduced the expression of EGFR ligands compared with
gemcitabine alone (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results
indicated that the gemcitabine-induced EGFR ligands upregulation and EGFR/ErbB2 activation require intact MAPK
signaling and these are secondary effects of MAPK signal
activation. On the other hand, PD325901 without gemcitabine
rather activated the phosphorylation of EGFR, which was
consistent with several recent reports showing that selective
inhibitors of BRAF and MEK can induce EGFR (refs. 29, 30;
Supplementary Fig.S2). The expression of EGFR ligands were
also reduced after incubation with PD325901 alone (Supplementary Fig. S3).
We also observed that gemcitabine þ PD0325901 signiﬁcantly inhibited the growth of PDAC cells in vitro compared
with gemcitabine alone and similarly to the gemcitabine þ
erlotinib, which suggested that the effect of erlotinib was
mainly through the inhibition of MAPK signaling (Supplementary Fig. S4). While MEK inhibition itself might induce certain
feedback loop of other signal transduction (as shown in the
PD325901 alone-induced EGFR/ErbB2 activation), erlotinib
inhibited many downstream pathways of EGFR other than
MAPK signaling, which could be the difference between these 2
drugs. We showed a signal diagram in Fig. 8.
Gemcitabine-induced EGFR/ErbB2-MAPK signal
activation is a common phenomenon in PDAC and lung
cancer cells irrespective of KRAS mutation status and
gemcitabine sensitivity
We evaluated whether gemcitabine-induced EGFR/ERBB2
induction was related to KRAS status or gemcitabine sensitivity. We observed that gemcitabine induced the activation of
EGFR/ERBB2 dose dependently in PDAC cell lines irrespective
of KRAS status and gemcitabine sensitivity (Supplementary
Fig.S5A and S5C). Besides, we also examined human lung
cancer cells because gemcitabine is commonly used in the
treatment and found that gemcitabine also induced EGFR/
ERBB2 activation irrespective of KRAS status (Supplementary
Fig. S5B).

extended survival of the mice signiﬁcantly, which suggested
that this model might be suitable for evaluating treatment
regimens for PDACs. The survival period was further dramatically extended by adding erlotinib to gemcitabine. This model
is useful for evaluating not only the survival impact but also the
mode of action of therapeutic regimens for PDAC.
In this study, we show one of the mechanisms by which the
EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib, inhibits PDAC with extremely frequent KRAS mutation. Although EGFR overexpression has
been reported as a common feature of PDAC (30%–70%; refs. 9,
10), activating EGFR mutations have rarely been reported, and
EGFR gene copy number and KRAS mutational status were not
found to be predictive markers of a survival beneﬁt from EGFR
inhibitor (9). The human PDAC and lung cancer cells used in

2230

Cancer Res; 73(7) April 1, 2013

this study had no EGFR mutations. We showed that gemcitabine induced activation of EGFR and ErbB2 as well as downstream MAPK signal activation, which was completely inhibited by adding erlotinib even in the KRAS-mutant PDAC cells.
This phenomenon was commonly seen in the PDAC cells
irrespective of gemcitabine sensitivity or KRAS mutation status
and was also common in lung cancer cells.
We observed that EGFR ligand upregulation and EGFR/
ErbB2 heterodimer formation were involved in gemcitabineinduced MAPK signal activation in PDAC. The phenomenon
that gemcitabine induced EGFR-MAPK signaling activation
has been reported in previous studies; however, EGFR phosphorylation might rapidly cause EGFR degradation and the
signal activation might vary depending on the cell context and

Erlotinib Inhibits Gemcitabine-Induced MAPK Signaling in PDAC

time course (31–33). Recently, it was reported that gemcitabine
enhanced the heterodimer formation of EGFR with ErbB3 and
secretion of amphiregulin, resulting in MAPK signal activation

www.aacrjournals.org

in human PDAC cells in vitro (34). Previous reports also
described that overexpression of ErbB3 is related to tumorigenesis and progression of pancreatic cancer and to sensitivity
of erlotinib (34–36). Our results revealed that gemcitabine
treatment upregulated not only amphiregulin but also TGFa and EGF and induced a heterodimer formation of EGFR with
ErbB2 in the PDAC cells. These results indicate that similar but
somewhat different mechanisms are involved in certain type of
PDAC. We further observed that the gemcitabine-induced
EGFR ligand expression and EGFR/ErbB2-MAPK signaling was
a secondary effect of active MAPK signaling, which suggested
that there might be certain signaling loop amplifying EGFR/
ErbB2-MAPK signaling. Although MEK inhibition suppressed
the expression of EGFR ligands, it activated EGFR/ErbB2. In
contrast, erlotinib inhibited many downstream pathways of
EGFR other than MAPK signaling, which could be the difference between these 2 drugs (Fig. 8).
ErbB2 is a well-known prognostic factor and therapeutic
target in breast and gastric cancers. Overexpression and
ampliﬁcation of ErbB2 is observed in 20% to 30% of breast
cancer (37, 38) and in 7% to 34% of gastric cancer (39–41).
Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against ErbB2, has a
survival beneﬁt in ErbB2-positive breast cancer (42) and gastric
cancer (43). In PDAC, ErbB2 overexpression is observed (10%–
82%) but does not correlate with poor prognosis (44–46).
Although the antitumor effect of trastuzumab was documented in patients with high ErbB2 expression (47), survival effects
of ErbB2 inhibitor in PDAC were not signiﬁcant in clinical trials
(48). The true clinical advantage of ErbB2-targeted therapy in
PDAC therefore remains unclear. We observed that the
KrasG12DþTgfbr2KO PDAC showed a better survival response
to the gemcitabine plus erlotinib compared with the result of
human clinical trial (4). The suggested mechanism involved
ErbB2. In addition, murine PDAC with high Egfr expression
occupied the entire pancreas following gemcitabine alone
treatment, whereas PDAC with low Egfr expression showed
frequent normal pancreas (Figs. 1, 3, and 6). Taken together, it
might be possible that certain subpopulation of patients with
PDAC, for example, with disrupted TGF-b signaling and high
EGFR expression, can especially have the survival beneﬁt from
EGFR/ErbB2-targeted therapy.
Because the KrasG12D þ Tgfbr2KO PDAC contained abundant stromal components similar to human PDAC, we also
tried to clarify the effects of erlotinib on the tumor microenvironment, such as ﬁbroblasts, neutrophils, and macrophages.
Gemcitabine and erlotinib did not affect the intracellular
signaling of pancreatic ﬁbroblasts in vitro, and no prominent
differences were detected in immunohistochemistry of neutrophil and macrophage in the treated PDAC tissues. Thus, we
concluded that the major effect of erlotinib is on EGFR-MAPK
signaling in PDAC cells rather than the stromal cells.
In conclusion, the KrasG12DþTgfbr2KO PDAC recapitulates
chemosensitivity of human PDAC and was useful in the
investigation of efﬁcacy and mode of action of therapeutic
agents, which might provide important insights into the predictive markers, beneﬁcial drug combinations, and also beneﬁcial patient subpopulation. We found the underlying
mechanisms explaining why PDAC with highly frequent KRAS
