BACKGROUND: Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) (also known as diffuse-type giant cell tumor) and tenosynovial giant cell tumors (TGCT) are rare, usually benign neoplasms that affect the synovium and tendon sheaths in
young adults. These tumors are driven by the overexpression of colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1). CSF1 is expressed
by a minority of tumor cells, which, in turn attract non-neoplastic inflammatory cells that express CSF1 receptor
(CSF1R) through a paracrine effect. METHODS: Imatinib mesylate (IM) blocks CSF1R, and previous case reports indicated that it also exerts antitumor activity in PVNS. The authors conducted a multi-institutional retrospective study
to assess the activity of IM in patients with locally advanced/metastatic PVNS/TGCT. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients
from 12 institutions in Europe, Australia, and the United States were included. There were 13 men, the median age was
41 years, and the most common site of disease was the knee (n ¼ 17; 59%). Two patients had metastatic disease to
the lung and/or bone. Five of 27 evaluable patients had Response Evaluation in Solid Tumor (RECIST) responses
(overall response rate, 19%; 1 complete response and 4 partial responses), and 20 of 27 patients (74%) had stable disease. Symptomatic improvement was noted in 16 of 22 patients (73%) who were assessable for symptoms. Despite a
high rate of symptomatic improvement and a favorable safety profile, 6 patients discontinued because of toxicity,
and 4 patients decided to discontinue IM for no clear medical reason. CONCLUSIONS: IM displayed interesting
activity in patients with PVNS/TGCT, providing proof of concept for targeting CSF1R in this disease. The authors
concluded that the benefits of alleviating morbidity in patients with localized PVNS/TGCT must be balanced against

INTRODUCTION
Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a rare pathologic entity affecting the synovium and tendon sheath in
young adults. These usually benign neoplasms can be divided into the localized or nodular type, which affects the smaller
joints of the fingers and generally is extra-articular, and the diffuse type (D-TGCT), also known as pigmented villonodular
synovitis (PVNS), which usually affects larger joints and often is intra-articular and infiltrative.1 D-TGCT may result in
joint impairment or bone destruction either as a result of uncontrolled disease or as the result of successive and sometimes

radical surgical procedures. Surgery is usually considered
the mainstay of therapy, although no standard therapy has
been defined to date for this rare disease. External-beam
radiation therapy also has been reported in the treatment
of PVNS, in most patients as an adjunct to surgical resection to improve local control.2 Isotopic synoviorthesis
using Yttrium 90 or Rhenium 186 also has been reported
as an adjunct to surgical excision.3 Although these tumors
are benign in the vast majority of patients, malignant
transformation of D-TGCT has been described in several
case reports and small series.4,5
TGCT and PVNS commonly over express colonystimulating factor 1 (CSF1) and are recognized as different clinical presentations of the same disease. In 30% to
60% of patients, CSF1 overexpression results from a
t(1;2) translocation, which fuses the CSF1 gene to the collagen type VI a3 (COL6A3) promoter.6,7 West et al suggested that this translocation leads to the overexpression
of active CSF1, which, in turn, attracts non-neoplastic
inflammatory cells that express the CSF1 receptor
(CSF1R) through a paracrine or ‘‘landscape’’ effect.7 Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that has activity against CSF1R.8 We hypothesized that imatinib
mesylate may have activity in patients with PNVS/TGCT
through the inhibition of CSF1-driven chemotaxis. After
the treatment and report of a single patient,9 imatinib
mesylate has been given to several patients who were
affected with locally advanced and/or metastatic TGCTs.
The objective of the current retrospective study was to
assess the efficacy of imatinib mesylate in this rare disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted a retrospective study of all consecutive
patients with TGCT who received imatinib mesylate at
12 referral centers in Europe (9 institutions), the United
States of America (2 institutions), and Australia (1 institution). Histologic diagnosis was performed locally by pathologists with extensive experience in mesenchymal
tumors. Data were extracted from individual patient files
and were analyzed by the local investigator. Image data
(typically magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] studies)
demonstrating tumor size were collected from individual
sites without central review. Response was measured using
version 1.0 of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST). Data were described using percentages for qualitative variables and using medians with
ranges for continuous variables. Patients were not treated
on a research protocol; therefore, they provided informed

1650

consent to treatment with a nonconventional medical
treatment, which was selected because of the lack of alternative therapies known to be effective in the disease. This
retrospective analysis was approved by the Ethics Committee in Lyon (Committee for the Protection of Individuals, Sud-Est IV, Lyon, France). Survival was plotted
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Overall survival (OS)
was calculated from the date imatinib mesylate was started
to the date of death. Progression-free survival (PFS) was
calculated from the date imatinib was started to the date
of disease progression or death. The time to treatment
failure (TTF) was calculated from the date imatinib mesylate was started to the date imatinib was stopped because
of toxicity, disease progression, or death, whichever
occurred first. Several patients underwent surgical resection of their disease after treatment with imatinib mesylate; for these patients, PFS and TTF were censored at the
time of surgery. Symptomatic response was defined as
improvement of pain and/or joint function in patients
who had symptoms at baseline. All statistical analyses
were performed using the SPSS statistical software package (version 12.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Patients
Twenty-nine patients were included in this study, and
their main characteristics are described in Table 1. One
patient was described previously by Blay et al.9 The median patient age at the start of imatinib mesylate was 41
years (range, 21-77 years). Most patients (20 of 29; 69%)
had undergone previous surgery. For these patients, the
quality of the last surgery was microscopically complete
resection (R0) in 4 patients (20%), macroscopically complete resection (R1) in 6 patients (30%), macroscopically
incomplete resection (R2) in 9 patients (45%), and
unknown in 1 patient (5%). Two patients had biopsyproven metastatic relapse, in both patients after 2
operations for local disease. For both of these patients, the
metastatic disease was histologically proven to be malignant transformation of TGCT/PVNS. Four of the 9
remaining patients received imatinib mesylate as neoadjuvant therapy before they underwent surgical excision.
Treatment and Safety
All patients were received imatinib mesylate 400 mg daily
except for 1 patient who received 600 mg daily. The median follow-up for all patients was 10.8 months (range,
3.0-42.9 months), and the estimated median time on

One patient had multifocal disease involving both the foot and knee;

imatinib (TTF) was 7 to 4 months (95% confidence interval, 4.7-10.0 months). The main toxicities of imatinib
mesylate in this setting and the main reasons for treatment
discontinuation are described in Table 2. Overall, despite
the low rate of grade 3 and 4 adverse events, 6 of 15
patients who discontinued imatinib mesylate did so
because of treatment-related side effects, and 4 additional
patients decided to discontinue imatinib mesylate for specific medical reason (patient choice). Seven patients
underwent surgery at a median of 6.5 months (range, 4.79.9 months) after starting imatinib mesylate. The surgery
was microscopically complete (R0) in 3 patients, macroscopically complete (R1) in 3 patients, and macroscopically incomplete (R2) in 1 patient. All of these 7 patients
discontinued imatinib mesylate before surgery: Four
patients stopped because of surgery, 2 patients stopped
because of adverse events (2.6 months and 4.4 months
before surgery), and 1 patient chose to stop for no clear
medical reason (1.7 months before surgery). After a median postoperative follow-up of 7.6 months (range, 1.311.8 months), none of these patients developed recurrent
disease recurred.

The other grade 3 and 4 toxicities were one grade 4 febrile neutropenia
and one grade 4 hepatitis.

Efficacy
Overall, 27 patients (93%) were evaluable for response.
The best tumor shrinkage evaluated according to RECIST
is depicted in Figure 1. One patient was not evaluable
because imatinib mesylate was stopped within the first
month when the patient developed febrile neutropenia,
and another patient was not evaluable because imatinib
mesylate was stopped when grade 3 edema developed
before the first radiologic assessment. One patient (4%)
had a complete response on imatinib,9 and 4 patients
(15%) had a partial response (overall response rate, 19%).
Twenty patients (74%) had stable disease as their best
response. Of these 20 patients, 3 were not assessable for
symptomatic benefit because they were asymptomatic at
baseline. Of the 17 patients with RECIST-evaluated stable disease who were assessable for symptomatic response,
11 patients (65%) had symptomatic improvement (reduction of pain and/or swelling). The overall symptomatic
response (73%) is described in Table 3, which also summarizes the efficacy measures in this study.
Eight patients had pretreatment and follow-up
(18F)-fluorodeoxy-glucose–positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET) scans available. One patient had a
complete response on an 18FDG-PET scan followed by a
RECIST-evaluated complete response on an MRI study.
Five patients had a partial response observed on 18FDGPET scans according to European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) criteria; of
these patients, 1 had a RECIST-defined partial response

(Fig. 2), and 4 had stable disease by RECIST on an MRI
study (Fig. 1). Finally, 1 patient had stable disease on an
18FDG-PET scan and also had RECIST-defined stable
disease on an MRI image. In addition, 1 patient with metastatic disease had progressive disease according to
EORTC criteria on an 18FDG-PET scan and also had
RECIST-defined progressive disease on a computed tomography scan).
At the last follow-up, only 6 patients had progressed,
including 3 of them at the first assessment. Two patients
with metastatic disease had progressive disease as their
best response: One of these patients had her primary tumor resected with a diagnosis of D-TGCT, followed by
local recurrence, which was resected. A further recurrence
developed in lymph node and lung. The lymph node
relapse was biopsied and diagnosed as malignant transformation of D-TGCT. She then started imatinib mesylate
but progressed rapidly; at this point, imatinib mesylate
was stopped, and the patient received conventional chemotherapy. The other patient had his primary tumor
resected at another hospital, and his pathology samples
were not available for review. After initial surgery, he had
both local and distant recurrences. Biopsy of a bone metastasis revealed malignant transformation of D-TGCT.
He also started imatinib mesylate but without response,
and he subsequently died of his metastatic disease. One
patient with localized disease had RECIST-defined stable
disease (10% increase in tumor size) but had clinical evidence of disease progression with worsening symptoms.
Of the 10 patients who discontinued imatinib mesylate either because of toxicity or because of the patient’s choice,

chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (GISTs). Other than blocking the Abelson protoCancer

also has been reported that imatinib mesylate inhibits
CSF1R.8,11 The use of imatinib in this indication is based
on the observation of the presence of a t(1;2) translocation
in more than half of tumors, leading to the overexpression
of active CSF1, which attracts inflammatory cells that
make up most of the tumor bulk in TCGT.6,7 Recently
however, Moller et al reported that, in 3 of 6 tumors in
which a COL6A3-CSF1 fusion transcript could be

detected, none contained the first 5 exons of CSF1, suggesting that the protein product misses the N-terminal
portion, which is required for receptor binding.12 However, these finding have not yet been confirmed using either protein expression analysis or immunohistochemistry.
Moreover, recent in vitro data obtained with CSF1-targeting monoclonal antibodies provides additional rationale
for targeting this axis in TGCT/PVNS.13
To our knowledge, this study is the first to report on
the activity of imatinib mesylate, a CSF1R tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, in a series of patients with locally advanced or

metastatic TGCT after the initial case report by Blay
et al.9 Taken together, the results from this retrospective
analysis indicate that imatinib mesylate has significant activity in this disease: Objective responses were reported in
close to 20% of patients, and 2 of 3 of patients achieved
tumor control. By comparison, objective response rates
with imatinib 400 mg daily in patients with advanced
GISTs and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans were 45%
and 46%, respectively.14,15
However, despite the favorable toxicity profile historically associated with imatinib mesylate, 6 patients discontinued treatment because of clinically significant
toxicity (3 of these patients had grade 3 or 4 toxicity), and
another 4 patients discontinued for no clear medical reason. These findings underline the need to balance symptom alleviation in a rarely lethal disease with potential
toxicities of chronic drug dosing. It is noteworthy that
most of the patients who discontinued imatinib mesylate
because of toxicity have not progressed after a median follow-up of 8.2 months after discontinuing imatinib mesylate, a result that contrasts with the 6-month PFS reported
for patients with GIST who stopped imatinib mesylate after 1 years or 3 years.16,17 However, the exact rate of disease progression before treatment with imatinib mesylate
was not assessed in the current study. It is noteworthy that
the 2 patients who had metastatic disease had rapid disease
progression on imatinib. This suggests that additional
molecular alterations may supervene, thereby rendering
malignant TGCT less sensitive to CSF1R inhibition.
The ultimate role of targeted therapeutics in notionally benign diseases like TGCT remains unclear. Molecular studies currently are underway to determine whether
the presence of a t(1;2) is predictive of imatinib efficacy in
this disease. Despite its limitations related to its retrospective nature, this study provides a proof of concept for targeting the CSF1/CSF1-R pathway in patients with
TCGT, which may be a valuable option for patients with
advanced disease, although perhaps not for those with malignant TGCT. Alternative options for patients with
locally advanced TGCT include radiotherapy using either
external-beam radiotherapy or intra-articular radionuclide, which carries a theoretical risk of sarcoma transformation; although, to our knowledge, no such event has
been reported to date in this patient population. In addition, radiotherapy bears a significant risk of long-term
joint function impairment, leading to potentially significant morbidity mainly because of fibrosis.18 Drug therapy
with imatinib mesylate is not associated with such risk,
and our data indicate that imatinib mesylate is able to pro-

1654

vide symptomatic relief, although it is difficult to accurately assess symptomatic improvement in retrospective
studies. Thus, imatinib may represent an alternative to
radiotherapy for patients who have symptomatic TGCT/
PVNS that progresses or that is not amenable to surgery.
Furthermore, although our data provide proof of concept
for targeting CSF1/CSF1R in TGCT/PVNS, formal
studies are needed to confirm the role of imatinib mesylate in this disease. Two international phase 2 trials using
nilotinib, a CSF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potency
similar to that of imatinib mesylate, in patients with
advanced TGCT or PVNS are currently ongoing
(NCT01207492 and NCT01261429, www.clinicaltrials.gov [Accessed June 6, 2011]).
