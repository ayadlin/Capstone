ABSTRACT
WCN-21 is a new camptothecin derivative we synthesized and has desirable
anti-tumor efficacy, but its aqueous solubility is very low and hurdles the further
evaluation and development. In this study, we prepared nanocrystals of WCN21 through a bottom-up approach to enhance its solubility and obtained WCN-21
nanorods (WND) and nanospheres (WNP). We investigated the crystallization of WND
and WNP in different temperature and solvents and found that both temperature and
solvents affect the crystal shapes and sizes. We prepared WND at 50°C and DMSO :
H2O 1: 50 and WNP at 25°C and DMSO : H2O 1: 100 and found they were dispersed
evenly in water with average hydrodynamic diameters 337 and 231 nm, respectively.
WND and WNP increased the solubility of WCN-21 from extreme insolubility to more
than 9 and 11 mM in H2O or PBS, respectively. In vitro studies showed that WND and
WNP enhanced the uptake of WCN-21 in tumor cells by 3 and 9 folds, and increased
cytotoxicity of WCN-21 in comparison with free WCN-21 by 5 and 6 folds, respectively.
In xenograft tumor mice, intravenous injection of WND and WNP enhanced the
accumulation of WCN-21 in tumor tissues and improved the anti-tumor efficacy. In
addition, WND and WNP did not increase the toxicity of WCN-21 in mice. Therefore,
nanocrystal is a robust tool to improve the solubility of insoluble drugs and holds a
great potential in the application of drug development.

INTRODUCTION

derivatives, has comparable efficacy but lower toxicity
in mice compared with Topotecan (data submitted
elsewhere). WCN-21 was synthesized by introducing
a thiocarbamide group to the 20´ position of CPT to
increase the stability and anti-tumor activity of CPT.
Anti-tumor efficacy of WCN-21 was 2 folds higher than
Topotecan in vitro and was comparable with Topotecan
in vivo. Moreover, its toxicity was significantly lower
than Topotecan in mice (data submitted elsewhere).
Thus it is worthy to further explore its therapeutic effects
and safety in more animal models. However, like many
other CPT derivatives, WCN-21 is water-insoluble, and
this insolubility leads to difficulties in administration
to animals and restricts the further evaluation and
successive development. Therefore, it is required to

Since isolated from Chinese tree Camptotheca
acuminate in 1960s, 20(S)-Camptothecin (CPT) and
its derivatives have been extensively explored as antitumor agents [1, 2]. Some of these derivatives, including
Irinotecan, SN-38 and Topotecan, have been approved
as chemotherapeutic drugs and widely used to treat
various human tumors in clinical [3, 4]. However, clinical
applications of these CPT derivatives are severely restricted
by their heavy toxicity and low stability in plasma [5–7].
Hence, finding novel CPT derivatives with high stability
and efficacy but low toxicity is still an unmet clinical need.
Recently, we synthesized a series of new CPT
derivatives and found that WCN-21, one of those

enhance the solubility of WCN-21 through either chemical
modifications or pharmaceutical formulations.
In comparison with the chemical modification, the
pharmaceutical approach has several advantages to improve
solubility of WCN-21. First, the chemical modification
might alter the toxicity of WCN-21 since it requires the
introduction of a hydrophilic group to the molecule. Second,
chemical modification may affect the stability of lactone
ring in WCN-21, which is critical for the anti-tumor activity
of camptothecin derivatives [8, 9]. Therefore, further
chemical modifications may lead to the loss of anti-tumor
activity and increased toxicity of WCN-21. Pharmaceutical
improvement, however, will not alter the molecular
structure and hence does not affect the inherent activity and
toxicity of WCN-21. Hence, pharmaceutical approaches are
more appropriate than chemical modifications to improve
the solubility of WCN-21.
To improve solubility of drugs, many nano systems
have been fabricated and applied, such as liposomes,
micelles, silica nanoparticles and dendrimers [10–12]. In
our previous work, we also used multiple nano systems to
improve the solubility of drugs and found that these nano
systems indeed improve the solubility and hence enhance
the efficacy [13, 14]. However, the auxiliary ingredients
used in these nano systems have potential systemic
toxicity and may obstruct the further evaluation of safety
of WCN-21 [15].
Nanocrystals, in contrast, contain no auxiliary
material and serve as an ideal formulation for WCN-21.
Since the nanocrystals offer a drug loading as high as 100%
without any encapsulating/solubilizing excipients, [16, 17]
it can avoid toxic side effects inflicted by the excipients
and also reach therapeutic concentrations at low dose [18].
Moreover, nanocrystals have retention and permeability
(EPR) effect as the other nano systems do [19, 20]. Hence,
nanocrystals may increase the solubility of WCN-21 and
do not affect the evaluation to its druggability.
At present, nanocrystals are produced by either
top-down or bottom-up approaches [21, 22]. A top-down
approach generally leads to instability of chemicals and
transition of crystal forms during the grinding processing.
[23] In addition, top-down approaches are time consuming
and energy intensive [24, 25]. In contrast, bottom-up
approaches were used to grow nanocrystals by injecting
a compound solution into antisolvent [15, 26, 27]. This
crystal growing process is mild and generally does
not affect the structure stability of molecules, which is
critically fit for WCN-21 [28, 29].
In this study, we prepared WCN-21 nanocrystals
using a bottom-up approach and obtained two forms of
nanocrystals, WCN-21 nanorods (WND) and nanospheres
(WNP). We compared their uptake, cytotoxicity,
pharmaceutical properties and anti-tumor effects with free
WCN-21 in vitro and in vivo. Our study illustrates that the
nanocrystal formulation enhances the solubility and antitumor effects of WCN-21 without increasing its toxicity

and is a feasible approach to improve the solubility of
insoluble drugs.

RESULTS
Preparation and characterization of WND and
WNP
To prepare the nanocrystals of WCN-21, we first
explored the impacts of ratio of solvents and temperature on
the crystallization Figure 1. When the ratio DMSO/H2O was at
1 : 10 or 1 : 25, large floc was observed (Figure 2A
and 2B). When the ratio DMSO/H2O was at 1 : 50 or 1 : 100,
WCN-21 nanorods (Figure 2C) and nanospheres (Figure 2E,
2G and 2H) were obtained, respectively. At a DMSO/H2O
ratio of 1 : 75, both nanorods and nanospheres were observed
(Figure 2D). At a DMSO/ H2O ratio of 1 : 200, WCN-21
formed nanospheres (Figure 2F).
Temperature also affected the crystallization. At
50°C and a DMSO/H2O ratio 1 : 100, inhomogenous
WCN-21 nanospheres were obtained (Figure 2E). At
25°C and same DMSO/H2O ratio, homogenous WCN-21
nanospheres were obtained (Figure 2H). At 0°C, excessive
crystallization resulted in reduced crystal formation
(Figure 2G).
According to these results, we then prepared a batch
of WCN-21 nanorods (DMSO/H2O at 1 : 50, temperature at
50°C) and nanospheres (DMSO/H2O at 1 : 100, temperature
at 25°C) and characterized those nanocrystals. The average
particle diameters of WND and WNP were then measured
using transmission electron microscope (TEM) and
analyzed using software Nano Measurer 1.2.0 (http://nanomeasurer.software.informer.com/). The results showed
that average particle diameters of WND and WNP were
162.70 ± 4.3 and 106.25 ± 2.9 nm, respectively (Table 1).
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis showed that
the average hydrodynamic diameters of WND and WNP
were 336.9 ± 17.9 nm and 230.6 ± 7.8 nm, respectively
(Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). The polydispersity
indexes (PDI) of WND and WNP were 0.304 and 0.258,
respectively, indicating narrow size distributions of those
particles. Zeta potential of WND and WNP were −3.99
± 1.04 and −8.57 ± 3.13 mV, respectively (Table 1 and
Supplementary Figure 1). TEM images also demonstrated
that WND and WNP were dispersed evenly in the solution,
with uniform particle shapes (Figure 3A and 3C). Critically,
WCN-21 is extremely insoluble in pure water and 5 mM
in H2O with 5% DMSO as co-solvent. In contrast, WND
and WNP significantly increased its solubility to more than
9 mM and 11 mM in H2O or PBS without any co-solvent.
In addition, we did not observe significant changes of size,
zeta potential and PDI after 7 days storage of WNP or
WND in H2O (Supplementary Figure 2).
Considering that the micro-environment in tumor
tissues tends to be more acidic (pH 5.0–6.5) than that
in normal tissues (pH 7.4), we examined the release

properties of WCN-21 from WND or WNP in PBS with
low pH values. As exhibited in Figure 3B and 3D, release
of WCN-21 from WND or WNP at pH 6.4 was more rapid
and efficient than that at pH 7.4, suggesting acid liable
release properties of WND and WNP. In addition, aqueous
solution of WND and WNP showed typical Tyndall light
scattering (Figure 3E). We examined the fluorescence
spectrum of WCN-21 in a H2O/DMSO mixture using a
fluorescence spectrophotometer and found a red-shift
of the maximum emission from 423 (WCN-21) to 435
(WND) and 430 nm (WNP), respectively (Figure 3F).
These results indicate that WCN-21 was self-assembled
to nanocrystals as expected.

3 and 9 folds of free WCN-21 (6.9%), respectively
(Figure 4C). These data suggest that WND and WNP can
increase the uptake and accumulation of WCN-21 in tumor
cells compared with free WCN-21.
We detected the cytotoxicities of WND and WNP in
HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7 or L02 cells. We treated those cells with
drugs for 24 or 48 h and determined the viability using MTT
assay. In all tumor cell lines, WCN-21 showed comparable
cytotoxic activity with free Topotecan. However, WND and
WNP have much lower IC50 than free WCN-21 in all tumor
cells, suggesting increased cytotoxicities of WND and WNP
(Figure 5 and Table 2). Furthermore, prolonging the treatment
time from 24 to 48 h improved the cytotoxic effect of WND
and WNP, suggesting that WND and WNP maintained a
sustaining release of WCN-21 in tumor cells (Figure 5 and
Table 2). Of note, the IC50 values of Topotecan, WCN-21,
WND and WNP were higher than 0.5 mM in L02 cells (Figure
5G, 5H and Table 2). These results suggest that cytotoxicity of
WCN-21, WND or WNP on normal cell lines is low.

Uptake and anti-tumor activity of WND and
WNP in vitro
To determine the uptake of WND and WNP in tumor
cells, we treated HepG2 cells with WCN-21, WND or WNP
at a WCN-21 concentration of 10 μM. Flow cytometry
analysis showed that both WND and WNP promoted the
uptake of WCN-21 in HepG2 cells compared with free
WCN-21 (Figure 4A). Fluorescence spectrophotometer
examination revealed that WCN-21 contents were 0.073,
0.151 and 0.441 μg/2.5 × 105 cells in WCN-21, WND
or WNP treated HepG2 cells, respectively (Figure 4B).
The uptake percentage of WCN-21 was determined by
the ratio of WCN-21 amounts in the cells to the initially
given amounts of WCN-21. The result showed that uptake
percentages of WND and WNP were 19.6% and 63.0%,

WND and WNP induce apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest in HepG2 cells
To explore whether WND and WNP exert anti-tumor
effect through the mechanism as WCN-21, we treated
HepG2 cells with low dose WCN-21, and equivalent dose
WND or WNP. After 24 h treatment, 0.02 μM WCN21 induced apoptosis in 19.08% HepG2 cells, whereas
the vehicle induced only 7.4% apoptosis in treated
cells (Figure 6A). WND treatment induced apoptosis

in 21.7% HepG2 cells, while WNP induced apoptosis in
28.2% HepG2 cells (Figure 6A). This result indicates
that WND and WNP promote the apoptosis of HepG2
cells in a marginal strength in comparison with WCN-21.
We then examined the effects of WND and WNP on cell
cycle progression of HepG2 cells. Cell cycle analysis by
FACS showed that HepG2 cells treated with WCN-21,
WND or WNP were all arrested in G2 phase, suggesting
that anti-tumor activity of WND or WNP was dependent
on release of WCN-21 (Figure 6B). To confirm those
phenotypic observations in molecular level, we detected
expression of apoptosis and proliferation related genes. In
both HepG2 and Hep3B cells, WND and WNP treatment
significantly increased expression of Bax and cleaved
Caspase-3 as WCN-21 did (Figure 6C). Correspondingly,
anti-apoptosis gene Bcl-2 was down-regulated upon WCN21, WND or WNP treatment in both HepG2 and Hep3B
cells (Figure 6C). Likewise, G2 phase related cyclin A2
and cyclin B1 were accumulated upon WCN-21, WND
or WNP treatment due to cell cycle arrest in G2 phase
(Figure 6D). Correspondingly, G1 phase related cyclin E1
was decreased in treated cells (Figure 6D). Taken together,
these results indicate that though WND and WNP enhanced
anti-tumor effects of WCN-21, their anti-tumor mechanism
was consistent with that of WCN-21.

to xenograft tumor mice at a dose of 4 mg/kg WCN-21
and then mouse tissues were collected and analyzed after
sacrifice of mice. Compared with free WCN-21, WND
and WNP injections significantly increased the amount
of WCN-21 in mouse hearts, livers, spleens, lungs and
kidneys by 2–3 folds and 3–10 folds, respectively (Figure 7
and Supplementary Figure 3). In addition, the amount
of free WCN-21 in tumor tissue was less than 0.1 μg/g
tissue (0.09% ID/g), significantly lower than that of WND
(1.94 μg/g, 2.4% ID/g) and WNP (3.55 μg/g, 4.4% ID/g)
at 0 min after injections. At 1 and 2 h post injections, WNP
demonstrated a better retention in tumor tissues compared
with WND, with average concentrations of 1.95 and
0.19 μg/g tissue, respectively. These results indicate that
both WND and WNP can increase the accumulation of
WCN-21 in tumor tissues through EPR effects.
Next, we examined the pharmacokinetics of WND
and WNP and obtained their plasma clearance kinetics.
The Cmax of WND (1820 ng/ml) and WNP (1868 ng/ml)
were much lower than that of free WCN-21 (3398 ng/ml).
The t1/2 of WND and WNP was 2 folds of that of WCN-21
(Figure 8A).
We then evaluated anti-tumor efficacy of WCN-21,
WND and WNP using a HepG2 xenograft tumor mouse
model. WCN-21, WND or WNP was administrated by tail
vein injection at the concentration of 4 mg/kg WCN-21
when the subcutaneous tumors grew to ~50 mm3. Tumor
volume and mouse body weights were recorded during
drug administration period. The mice were sacrificed at
25th day after the injection and tumors were collected
for histology examination. At 25th day, tumor sizes of
WCN-21 group mice (939 mm3) were relatively higher than
that of Topotecan group mice (837 mm3). However, tumors

effects of WCN-21, WND and WNP in mice
To compare the distribution of WND and WNP with
WCN-21 in mouse tissues, we injected (i.v.) tumor bearing
mice with WCN-21, WND or WNP and then examined
their distribution. WCN-21, WND or WNP was injected

were smaller than that in Topotecan group (Figure 8C).
The tumor morphology also showed that WND and WNP
have more robust anti-tumor efficacy compared with free
WCN-21 (Figure 8D). Hence, these results indicate
that WND and WNP enhanced the anti-tumor effect of
WCN-21.

To further assess the anti-tumor mechanism of
WND and WNP, we performed histological analysis in
tumor tissues treated with WND or WNP. Compared with
saline, all of WCN-21, WND, WNP and Topotecan led

to coagulation necrosis, cellular crenulation and nucleus
vanish in tumor tissues (Figure 9A). Considering these
pathological features are typical traits of apoptosis, we
examined the apoptotic activity in tumor samples using
TUNEL assay. We found that no TUNEL staining was
observed in saline injected mice, while robust TUNEL
signaling was widespread in all the drugs treated tumors
(Figure 9B). In addition, WND and WNP induced more
apoptosis than free WCN-21 in tumors, which is consistent
with the efficacy study (Figure 9D). Furthermore, Ki67
staining also indicated that tumor cell proliferation in
WCN-21 treated mice was comparable with that in
Topotecan treated mice, but it was faster than that in
WND and WNP treated mice (Figure 9C, 9E). These data
collectively suggest that WND and WNP inhibit the tumor
growth by inducing apoptosis, which is identical with the
mechanism of WCN-21.

during crystallization: nucleation and crystal growth
rate[30]. Both the nucleation and crystal growth depend
on the level of supersaturation [31]. Compared with the
crystal growth rate, the nucleation rate is more dependent
on supersaturation [32]. Increasing the supersaturation
level leads to augmented nuclei formation and
subsequently decreased crystal size [33].
Our result indicates that ratio of solvents affected
the supersaturation and subsequently the particle sizes.
DMSO/H2O at 1:10 or 1:25 was good solvent for WCN21 and led to low degree of supersaturation. Therefore,
WCN-21 molecules formed large floc rather than
nanocrystals because of fewer nuclei being formed (Figure
2A and 2B). In contrast, DMSO/H2O ratio at 1 : 50 or
1 : 100 increased supersaturation of WCN-21, and led to
formation of nanorods (Figure 2C) or nanospheres (Figure
2E, 2G and 2H), respectively. However, further increasing
supersaturation (DMSO/H2O 1 : 200) did not show impact
on the crystallization, possibly because nucleation rate
approached maximum value (Figure 2F). Of note, both
nanorods and nanospheres were observed at a DMSO/
H2O ratio of 1 : 75, suggesting that crystal shapes were
also associated with supersaturation (Figure 2D). Taken
together, we conclude that reducing the proportion
of good solvent in a specific range leads to increased
supersaturation and then enhances crystal formation. In
addition, degree of supersaturation also affects the crystal
shapes.
Our results also demonstrated that temperature had
influence on the WCN-21 supersaturation level. Decreasing
the temperature led to increased supersaturation (Figure 2).
At DMSO/H2O ratio 1:100 and 50°C, the solubility of
WCN-21 in the DMSO/H2O is higher than that at 25°C and
resulted in a lower degree of supersaturation. Furthermore,
higher temperature led to lower crystal growth rate and
inhomogenous WCN-21 nanospheres (Figure 2E).
At 25°C, supersaturation increased, and homogenous
WCN-21 nanospheres were obtained (Figure 2H).
However, too low temperature did not favor the formation
of WCN-21 nanocrystals. At 0°C, too rapid crystallization
resulted in decreased formation of regular nanocrystals
(Figure 2G). Taken together, optimization of the
antisolvent/solvent ratio and temperature were critical for
the preparation of WCN-21 nanocrystals and this finding
may be applicable to other camptothecin derivatives.
Compared with free WCN-21, both WND and WNP
showed a higher uptake in tumor cells and xenograft tumor
tissues. Analyses using flow cytometry and fluorescence
spectrophotometer showed that the amount of WND
and WNP were significantly higher than that of free
WCN-21 in HepG2 cells (Figure 4). It suggests that
WCN-21 nanocrystals indeed improve the uptake and
accumulation of WCN-21 in cancer cells.
Of note, the uptake percentage of WNP was higher
than that of WND in tumor cells. This phenomenon was

Toxicity of WND and WNP in mice
To determine the toxicity of WND and WNP, we
collected tissues from the mice used in efficacy study
for histological analysis. Compared with control mice,
Topotecan treated mice exhibited myocardial fiber
fracture and cardiocytes necrosis in hearts, inflammatory
infiltration in livers, atrophied white pulp in spleens and
disorganization of renal corpuscles in kidneys. Compared
with Topotecan, WCN-21 did not produce significant
injury in those organs (Figure 10). As expected, WND and
WNP also did not show any toxicity in mice (Figure 10).
Moreover, all mice in Topotecan group had a significant
body weight loss, while mice in WCN-21, WND or WNP
group had no apparent body weight loss (Figure 8B).
These results indicate that Topotecan had certain toxicity
while WCN-21, WND or WNP had little or no toxicity in
mice during the experimental period.

DISCUSSION
Solubility is a crucial parameter for a chemical in
term of druggability. Many camptothecin derivatives are
hampered to be transformed into clinical studies due to
low solubility. In previous studies, we synthesized a new
camptothecin WCN-21, which has higher anti-tumor
activity than Topotecan. However, its low solubility
restricted the further evaluation. In this study, we prepared
nanocrystals of WCN-21 and found that those nanocrystals
could improve the solubility of WCN-21 significantly.
Our study confirmed the feasibility using nanocrystals to
enhance the solubility of insoluble drug.
During the preparation, we found that the yield
and shape of WCN-21 nanocrystals were affected by
both the ratio DMSO/H2O and temperature. A possible
explanation was that those two factors affected the
crystallization of WCN-21. There are two crucial steps

potentially due to different size, charge, and shape between
the WND and WNP. Since WND and WNP have similar
zeta potential, size and shape are two factors affecting
their uptake efficiency. It has been reported that in the
same hydrodynamic size nanorods penetrate tumors more
rapidly than nanospheres [34]. In addition, smaller size is
beneficial for nanoparticle to enter cells [35]. Considering
WNP (hydrodynamic size 230.6 ± 7.8 nm) was smaller
than WND (336.9 ± 17.9 nm), higher uptake efficiency of
WNP was potentially due to its smaller size.
The sizes of WND and WNP also affected their
tissue distribution and pharmacokinetics. For instance,
the distribution of WND in mouse lungs was higher
than that in WNP. It was reported that the distribution of
nanocrystals in mouse organs following i.v. injection is
depending on their particle size and composition [36].
Because the components of WND and WNP were the
same, we speculate that the higher distribution of WND
in mouse lungs was attributed to its larger size. The
distinct pharmacokinetic properties of WND and WNP
from WCN-21 were also possibly attributed to their
larger sizes (> 200 nm), which led to slow dissolution in

plasma [36]. Consequently, nanocrystals are recognized
as foreign matters by phagocytic cells of mononuclear
phagocyte system (MPS) and cleared rapidly from plasma.
This leads to rapid decrease of WCN-21 in plasma after
WND or WNP injection in the first minutes. Subsequently,
phagocytic cells transferred those nanocrystals to RES
(reticuloendothelial system) organs such as liver, spleen
and lungs and resulted in high accumulation of WND and
WNP in those organs. Similar results was obtained by
Gao, L., et al. [37]
Furthermore, both WND and WNP increase the
accumulation of WCN-21 in tumor tissues compare with
free WCN-21. Efficient uptake of WCN-21 produced
better anti-tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo. WND
and WNP have lower IC50 in vitro and better tumor
suppression capability than WCN-21 and Topotecan
(Figure 5 and Table 2). In vivo, WND and WNP showed
significantly higher distribution in tumor tissues than free
WCN-21, thus profoundly enhanced the anti-tumor effects
of WCN-21. Taken together, these data suggest that the
WND and WNP enhance cytotoxic effects of WCN-21 by
increasing its uptake in tumor cells and tissues.

Taken together, our study, for the first time,
demonstrated that a camptothecin derivative WCN21 solely self-assembled into two different types of
nanocrystals. Both nanocrystals not only improved the
solubility of WCN-21 and its distribution in tumor tissues,
but also enhanced its anti-tumor efficacy. Therefore, our
study demonstrated that nanocrystal technique is effective
to improve the solubility and efficacy of new camptothecin
derivatives. The preparation and evaluation methods
described in this manuscript could be applied for the other
insoluble drugs.

resuspended in the H2O or PBS. Both WND and WNP
solution were stored at 4°C and protected from light.

WCN-21 was measured on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence
spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan) and calculated
according the standard curve of WCN-21.

Characterization of WND and WNP

Uptake of WCN-21 measured by flow cytometry

Particle sizes and zeta potential of WND and
WNP were measured by zeta potential analyzer (Zeta
PALS, Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, Austin,
TX) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All
measurements were carried out at room temperature.
Each parameter was measured 3 times; average values and
standard deviations were calculated. WND and WNP were
observed and photographed using a transmission electron
microscope (JEOL 100CX II TEM, Japan).
In vitro pH-dependent release of WCN-21 from
WND or WNP was studied using a dialysis method at
37°C. Phosphate-citrate buffered saline (PBS-citrate) at pH
7.4 and 6.4 was used as the drug-release media to simulate
normal tissue and tumor environment, respectively.
Dialysis bags (MW cutoff 1,000 Da) containing WND or
WNP were placed into brown bottles containing 8 ml of
PBS-citrate at pH 7.4 or 6.4. These bottles were shaken at
37°C while shielded from light. Samples were collected
at various intervals and equal volume of fresh buffer
was supplied each time. The concentration of released
