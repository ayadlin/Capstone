BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the pathologic inclusion criteria from all
contemporary adjuvant trials in predicting disease progression (DP) for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on 1363 patients treated surgically for M0 RCC at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN),
from 1990 to 2001. Clinicopathologic features were reviewed to determine eligibility for the following trials: ARISER,
ASSURE, EVEREST, PROTECT, SORCE, and S-TRAC. DP was defined as local recurrence or distant metastasis after
surgery. The ability of each trial’s inclusion criteria to accurately predict DP was evaluated by the c (concordance)
index. RESULTS: From the Mayo Clinic cohort, we determined that 41%, 45%, 45%, 33%, 47%, and 23% of the patients
would have been eligible for the ARISER, ASSURE, EVEREST, PROTECT, SORCE, and S-TRAC clinical trials, respectively. Overall, 23% of all patients experienced DP (n ¼ 317). Among eligible patients, 53%, 44%, 44%, 57%, 43%, and
59% developed DP during follow-up and 10%, 6%, 6%, 13%, 6%, and 18% went onto DP while not being eligible for the
ARISER, ASSURE, EVEREST, PROTECT, SORCE, and S-TRAC trials, respectively. The c index of each trial to accurately
predict DP from the pathologic inclusion criteria of ARISER, ASSURE, EVEREST, PROTECT, SORCE, and S-TRAC were
0.751, 0.751, 0.751, 0.742, 0.745, and 0.691, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although the pathologic inclusion criteria of
contemporary adjuvant trials have notable differences, all 6 adjuvant trials demonstrated high predictive accuracy of
DP. Overall, 43% to 59% of patients included for the adjuvant trials would develop DP, whereas 6% to 18% of patients

In 2010, it was estimated that there were 58,240 incident cases and 8210 deaths attributable to renal cell carcinoma
(RCC) in the United States.1 Although surgical extirpation remains the gold standard for localized RCC and confers
excellent cancer-specific survival at 5 years, a substantial proportion of patients remains at risk for disease progression
(DP). With approximately 25% of patients having metastatic disease and another 25% with locally advanced disease at
the time of diagnosis,2,3 10% to 28% of patients will later experience local recurrence or distant metastasis following nephrectomy.4-6
As such, phase 3 randomized trials have been initiated to assess the clinical efficacy of adjuvant therapy for patients
considered at intermediate or high risk for DP after partial or radical nephrectomy. Evidence to support the use of adjuvant therapy has been extrapolated from prior randomized trials for metastatic RCC.7-10 To date, 6 clinical trials have
been initiated and are currently ongoing in order to evaluate the potential benefits of adjuvant therapy using targeted
agents for intermediate-risk and high-risk M0 RCC: ARISER (Adjuvant Rencarex Immunotherapy Trial to Study

ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01235962), SORCE

(Sunitinib Treatment of Renal Adjuvant Cancer; ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT00375674).
In designing clinical trials, it is essential to designate
inclusion criteria that accurately predict prognosis in
order to appropriately identify individuals who are at high
risk for DP and exclude those individuals with low-risk
disease who may be unnecessarily treated.11 Appropriate
designation of inclusion criteria for clinical trials should
ideally be based on validated models for risk stratification.
However, all 6 of the contemporary adjuvant RCC trials
apply different pathologic inclusion criteria to determine
eligibility, which may reflect the lack of consensus regarding a universally accepted definition of high-risk RCC.1218
Furthermore, the accuracy of inclusion criteria for each
adjuvant clinical trial in predicting DP has yet to be evaluated. In this context, our objective was to evaluate the accuracy of the pathologic inclusion criteria from all
ongoing adjuvant trials in predicting DP following surgery for RCC.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Upon approval from the Institutional Review Board, we
identified 1363 patients treated with radical nephrectomy
or nephron-sparing surgery for unilateral, sporadic, M0
RCC between 1990 and 2001 from the Mayo Clinic Nephrectomy Registry.
Clinical and Pathologic Features
Clinical features evaluated in our study included age, sex,
and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status. Pathologic features studied included histologic
subtype classified according to the Union Internationale
Contre le Cancer, American Joint Committee on Cancer,
and Heidelberg guidelines; tumor size; the 2002 primary
tumor and regional lymph node classifications; nuclear

grade; coagulative tumor necrosis; and sarcomatoid
differentiation.19
Combinations of these pathologic features were
used to identify patients from our cohort who would be
eligible to participate based on the pathologic inclusion
criteria from each of the following phase 3 randomized
adjuvant trials: ARISER, ASSURE, EVEREST, PROTECT, SORCE, and S-TRAC (Table 1). In ARISER,
which has completed accrual, this 2-arm trial allocated
patients in a 1:1 randomization to receive intravenous girentuximib, a monoclonal antibody, or placebo. The inclusion trial selected only patients with clear cell RCC
histologic subtype. In addition, patients were considered
eligible and high-risk if the renal tumors had pT1b/pT2,
grade 3 to 4 disease; pT3/pT4 disease; or pN1/pN2 disease. The primary outcomes for this study are disease-free
survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).
The ASSURE study, which also has completed
accrual, is the only 3-arm, 2-agent clinical trial that randomly allocated patients to sorafenib, sunitinib, or placebo. The inclusion criteria for the ASSURE trial defined
eligibility for patients with a histologic diagnosis of clear
cell, papillary, or chromophobe RCC; and those with
pT1b, grade 3 or 4 disease; pT2/pT2/pT3/pT4, grade 1
through 4 disease; or those with pN1/pN2 disease. The
primary outcome for the ASSURE trial is DFS after partial or radical nephrectomy. The EVEREST study was
recently opened as a phase 3 clinical trial and is accruing
patients who will be allocated in a 1:1 randomization to
everolimus or placebo after surgery. The pathologic inclusion criteria and primary outcome for the EVEREST trial
are identical to those in the ASSURE trial.
In the PROTECT study, this phase 3 clinical trial is
currently accruing patients after nephrectomy for localized or locally advanced RCC. Patients are randomly
assigned to receive either pazopanib or placebo in a 1:1
allocation. However, the pathologic criteria for PROTECT uses 2010 TNM classification and considers
patients eligible to participate if there is clear cell RCC
with pT2, grade 3/4, pNX/N0 disease; pT3/4, any grade,
pNX/N0 disease; or pN1/pN2 disease. The primary outcome for PROTECT is DFS.
SORCE is an ongoing phase 3 clinical trial that is
currently recruiting patients to be enrolled into 1 of 3
arms, where patients will be randomly assigned sorafenib
for 3 years, sorafenib for 1 year, or placebo. SORCE is the
only study to use a validated stratification tool to calculate
the Mayo Clinic progression score to determine eligibility
for patients who have undergone nephrectomy.13 Patients

sunitinib or placebo with 1:1 allocation. Patients who
have clear cell RCC and pT3/pT4, or those with pN1/
pN2 disease will be considered eligible. The primary outcome for S-TRAC is DFS with an estimated time frame
to completion of 36 months.
To explore the effects of limiting the pathologic
inclusion criteria to the strict definitions of high-risk
RCC, we then used the University of California Los
Angeles Integrated Staging System (UISS) and the Mayo
Clinic progression score to define high-risk RCC as the
pathologic inclusion criteria for clinical trial eligibility. As
such, we used a cumulative UISS score of 3 or more to
define high risk for eligibility.15,20 According to the Mayo
Clinic progression score, we used the previous definition
based on a cumulative progression score of 6 or more to
define high risk for only the clear cell RCC subtype.13
Patient Outcome
Disease status for patients in the Nephrectomy Registry is
updated annually. If a patient has not been seen at our
institution in the previous year, the patient is sent a disease
status questionnaire. If there is evidence of DP (ie, local
recurrence or distant metastases) in this questionnaire, the
date, location, and treatment are verified in writing with
the patient’s local physician.
Statistical Analysis
Progression-free survival (PFS), which was defined as survival free of local recurrence or distant metastases, was
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The ability of
each trial’s inclusion criteria to predict DP was evaluated
using the c (for concordance) index for the Cox model
proposed by Harrell et al.21 The c index corresponds to
the proportion of all usable pairs of patients in which the
observed and predicted survival times are concordant.
The interpretation of the c index is identical to the interpretation of the area under a receiver operating characteristic curve. A c index of 1.0 indicates that the features in
the model perfectly separate patients with different outcomes, whereas a value of 0.5 indicates that the features
contain prognostic information equal to that obtained by
chance alone.

RESULTS
The clinical and pathologic features of the 1363 patients
with RCC in our analytic cohort are summarized in Table
2. Median age at surgery was 65 years (range, 21-89 years)
and median tumor size was 5.0 cm (range, 0.2-24.0 cm).

Overall, 317 (23.3%) patients in our analytic cohort experienced DP at a median of 1.6 years after nephrectomy
(range, 0.1-16.2 years). Among those patients with DP,
260 patients experienced distant metastases only, 19
patients had local recurrence only, and 38 patients experienced both local recurrence and distant metastases. At last
follow-up, 629 patients had died, including 259 patients
who died from RCC at a median of 2.7 years after surgery
(range, 0.0-16.5 years). Among the 734 patients who were
still alive at last follow-up, the median duration of followup was 9.4 years (range, 0.1-18.4 years). Overall, PFS
rates (95% confidence interval [CI]; number still at risk)
at 1, 5, and 10 years after surgery were 91.1% (89.6-92.6;
1175), 81.2% (79.0-83.3; 914), and 74.4% (71.9-77.1;
400), respectively.
Although 638 (46.8%) patients were eligible for the
SORCE trial, 428 (31.4%) of these eligible patients had
intermediate-risk RCC according to their Mayo Clinic
progression scores. Among 1036 patients with clear cell
RCC histologic subtype, 425 (41.0%), 338 (32.6%), and
239 (23.1%) patients were eligible for the ARISER, PROTECT, and S-TRAC trials, respectively. For the ASSURE
and EVEREST trials, 603 (44.7%) patients would have
been considered eligible from the 1348 patients with clear
cell, papillary, or chromophobe RCC.
All patients eligible for enrollment into the ARISER,
ASSURE, EVEREST, PROTECT, and S-TRAC trials
were also eligible to participate in the SORCE trial (Table
3). However, only 8 patients with clear cell RCC and intermediate Mayo Clinic progression score were eligible to
participate in the SORCE trial but no other trials. Of
these patients with intermediate-risk RCC, 2 patients had
pT1a, pNX/pN0, grade 4, necrotic clear cell RCC tumors
whereas the remaining 6 patients had pT1b, pNX/pN0,
grade 1/2, necrotic clear cell RCC tumors, yielding a progression score of 3 or 4. Seventy-three patients with clear
cell RCC were eligible for the ASSURE, EVEREST, and

4416

SORCE trials, but not the ARISER, S-TRAC, and PROTECT trials. All of these patients had pT2, pNX/pN0,
and grade 1/2 tumors.
DP varied according to the pathologic inclusion criteria eligibility for each clinical trial (Table 4). All trials
exhibited high rates of DP among eligible patients treated
with nephrectomy for localized RCC in our analytic
cohort. For example, among eligible patients from each
clinical trial, DP rates were 52.5%, 44.3%, 44.3%,
57.1%, 43.1%, and 59.0% for the ARISER, ASSURE,
EVEREST, PROTECT, SORCE, and S-TRAC, respectively. As a result, the c index of each clinical trial in predicting DP was similar and relatively accurate for the
ARISER (0.751; 95% CI ¼ 0.730-0.772), ASSURE and
EVEREST (0.751; 95% CI ¼ 0.732-0.770), PROTECT
(0.742; 95% CI ¼ 0.718-0.766), SORCE (0.745; 95%
CI ¼ 0.727-0.764), and S-TRAC (0.691; 95% CI ¼
0.664-0.719) trials. However, the percentages of patients
who met the inclusion criteria for the ARISER, ASSURE,
EVEREST, PROTECT, SORCE, and S-TRAC trials but
who did not experience DP varied at 47.5%, 55.7%,
55.7%, 42.9%, 56.9%, and 41.0%, respectively. Conversely, the percentages of patients who failed to meet the
inclusion criteria for the ARISER, ASSURE, EVEREST,
PROTECT, SORCE, and S-TRAC trials but did experience DP were 9.8%, 6.2%, 6.2%, 12.9%, 5.8%, and
17.8%, respectively.
All 6 trials demonstrated similar PFS for eligible and
ineligible patients, based on the pathologic inclusion criteria for each of the randomized adjuvant trials, with exception of the S-TRAC trial. In Figure 1, the 5-year PFS rate
(95% CI; number still at risk) for the 425 patients eligible
for the ARISER trial was 52.3% (47.6%-57.5%; 180). Of
the 223 patients eligible for the ARISER trial who progressed, 190 progressed within 5 years of surgery (85.2%).

for the S-TRAC trial who progressed, 126 patients progressed within 5 years of surgery (89.4%).

To ascertain variations in DP if a clinical trial
adopted more stringent inclusion criteria for strictly defining high risk to determine eligibility, a UISS score  3
and a progression score  6 yielded higher rates of eligible
individuals who experienced DP with a shorter median
time to DP. For example, in the UISS high-risk group for
all histologic subtypes, 42 patients (3.1%) would be eligible from the RCC cohort with a median time to DP of
0.4 years (Table 4). Moreover, adoption of a strict definition of the high-risk UISS classification increased DP to
73.8% (n ¼ 31) among all eligible patients. In clear cell
RCC with a progression score  6, 182 (17.6%) patients
would be eligible with a median time to progression of 0.8
years. Use of the standardized definition of high risk from
the Mayo Clinic progression score increased the DP to
69.8% (n ¼ 127) among all eligible patients. The percentages of patients who met the inclusion criteria for the
high-risk stratification by the UISS or the Mayo Clinic

of patients with intermediate-risk stratification by the
UISS score or the Mayo Clinic progression score may possibly lead to overtreatment. For example, approximately
half of the patients enrolled would have not progressed
and may be unnecessarily exposed to adverse events associated with targeted therapy in our large retrospective
cohort. Overtreatment of such individuals eligible for
enrollment by current criteria, but without DP, could be
decreased to 26% to 30% if the pathologic inclusion criteria became more stringent by selecting individuals with
only high-risk stratification, as defined by the Mayo
Clinic progression score or UISS classification. Moreover,
median time to progression for those eligible with highrisk stratification by UISS or the Mayo Clinic progression
score would be decreased to less than 1 year in both cases,

DISCUSSION
In this study, we report the effects of differing pathologic
inclusion criteria from contemporary adjuvant clinical trials in accurately predicting DP. Our study found that the
differing pathologic inclusion criteria from the ongoing
adjuvant trials had similar and relatively strong predictive
accuracy of DP. Our results also suggest that the inclusion

resulting in shorter duration of follow-up needed to detect
differences in progression and survival. Hence, use of a
strict pathologic inclusion criteria from UISS and the
Mayo Clinic progression score, thereby excluding intermediate-risk RCC, would take a shorter time period to
accumulate the necessary events of disease recurrence and,
as a result, report the results of each trial sooner in order
to possibly change clinical practice or inform the designs
of future clinical trials.
Designation of inclusion criteria for randomized
clinical trials ought to require a transparent process that
uses the best existing predictive models to appropriately
risk-stratify individuals who will most likely benefit from
treatment, while minimizing the enrollment of individuals with low risk of DP to avoid overtreatment. By doing
so, the inclusion criteria can be standardized to also allow
for evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of efficacy
and side effects for each targeted agent. Only the SORCE
trial used a previously validated stratification tool specifically designed for prospective clinical trials to better predict distant metastasis from clear cell RCC after radical
nephrectomy.13 For the ARISER, ASSURE, and EVEREST trials, the inclusion criteria were similar by using a
modified UISS.15,20
Given these differences in determining patient eligibility for each trial, it may be also difficult to assess the
comparative effectiveness from the clinical trials in order
to determine a superior targeted agent in reducing the risk
of disease relapse for several reasons. Each of the clinical
trials is designed to initially determine whether adjuvant
therapy with targeted agents for intermediate- or high-risk
RCC after nephrectomy reduces the risk of recurrence, by

randomly assigning patients to either the targeted agent or
placebo. At present, most of the ongoing phase 3 adjuvant
trials are not designed to evaluate which agent is the most
effective in reducing the risk of disease relapse after surgery, because these trials are not performing head-to-head
clinical trials or using an adaptive design to determine superiority, noninferiority, or futility.22,23 Only the results
from the ASSURE trial will allow for assessing the relative
effectiveness of sunitinib versus sorafenib in reducing the
risk of DP. Moreover, until all the trials are complete, it is
possible the clinical characteristics of the patients enrolled
in each adjuvant trial may be vastly different, such that
one would be unable to assess the relative effectiveness of
the different adjuvant agents from the clinical trials in this
study. Taken together, unless all trials either use a uniform
pathologic inclusion criteria or an adaptive clinical trial
design, or perform a head-to-head trial, which is premature until efficacy is initially demonstrated, it will be difficult for patients and providers to make fully informed
decisions about which agent and the dose is most effective
in reducing the risk of recurrence and minimizes treatment-related adverse events. Another important consideration is that patients who are eligible but without DP may
be unnecessarily exposed to adjuvant therapy with limited
clinical efficacy, but potentially significant adverse events.
There are several limitations about the inferences
from our study, regarding the accuracy of each clinical trial’s pathologic inclusion criteria. First, our study is subject
to the inherent biases from a large, single institution and
retrospective nephrectomy registry. Moreover, characteristics of the patient population from our institution may
ultimately differ from those individuals enrolled in the
multicenter phase 3 randomized trials. Second, our study
also did not evaluate the possible benefits derived from
each adjuvant agent in our cohort eligible for enrollment
in each phase 3 trial. Third, adoption of more stringent
pathologic inclusion criteria also resulted in a moderately
increased rate of patients who are not eligible that will experience DP, if a strict definition of high risk, as originally
described, was adopted from either the UISS or the Mayo
Clinic classification systems. Fourth, we also acknowledge
that each of the randomized trials’ existing pathologic
inclusion criteria had relatively high DP rates (>40%) following nephrectomy, such that adjuvant therapy would
be considered an acceptable aspect of the oncologic treatment. Furthermore, an implicit message of our study
assumes that patients found to have high-risk RCC will
achieve greater efficacy from adjuvant agents than those
with intermediate-risk disease. Indeed, a subgroup

4419

Original Article

analysis by risk stratification from the pathologic inclusion criteria from these adjuvant clinical trials may in fact
demonstrate that intermediate-risk patients will achieve
equal efficacy compared to high-risk patients, and that the
competing risk of disease recurrence may be greater in the
placebo arm of intermediate-risk patients with RCC.
In summary, our study demonstrates that each of
the ongoing adjuvant trial’s pathologic inclusion criteria
had similar and accurate abilities in predicting DP following surgery. However, there may be a substantial number
of eligible patients who are not destined for DP. Moreover, inclusion of intermediate-risk patients may require
longer follow-up time to detect differences in DP. Further
research is needed to implement a more uniform risk
stratification of high-risk RCC in the development of
inclusion criteria for randomized trials for adjuvant therapy for patients who have undergone nephrectomy.
