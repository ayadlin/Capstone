Abstract
Proteasome-regulated NF-kB has been shown to be important
for cell survival in T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma
models. Several new small-molecule proteasome inhibitors are
under various stages of active preclinical and clinical development. We completed a comprehensive preclinical examination of
the efﬁcacy and associated biologic effects of a second-generation
proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib, in T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma cells and in vivo SCID mouse models. We demonstrated that ixazomib induced potent cell death in all cell
lines at clinically achievable concentrations. In addition, it signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth and improved survival in T-cell
lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma human lymphoma xenograft models. Through global transcriptome analyses, proteasomal inhibition showed conserved overlap in downregulation of
cell cycle, chromatin modiﬁcation, and DNA repair processes
in ixazomib-sensitive lymphoma cells. The predicted activity for

Introduction
Understanding the pertinent and functional biologic oncogenic pathways of inhibition and mechanisms of resistance is critical
to optimally integrate novel therapeutics into cancer treatment
paradigms. Increased proteasomal activity is a frequently
observed phenomenon in malignant cells; hence, proteasome
inhibition may potentially block cell proliferation and result in
the inhibition of tumor progression (1). Bortezomib (Velcade)

tumor suppressors and oncogenes, the impact on "hallmarks
of cancer," and the analysis of key signiﬁcant genes from
global transcriptome analysis for ixazomib strongly favored
tumor inhibition via downregulation of MYC and CHK1, its target
genes. Furthermore, in ixazomib-treated lymphoma cells, we
identiﬁed that CHK1 was involved in the regulation of MYC
expression through chromatin modiﬁcation involving histone
H3 acetylation via chromatin immunoprecipitation. Finally,
using pharmacologic and RNA silencing of CHK1 or the associated MYC-related mechanism, we demonstrated synergistic cell
death in combination with antiproteasome therapy. Altogether,
ixazomib signiﬁcantly downregulates MYC and induces potent
cell death in T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma,
and we identiﬁed that combinatorial therapy with anti-CHK1
treatment represents a rational and novel therapeutic approach.

was the ﬁrst in class proteasomal targeted drug that is currently
FDA approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed and relapsed/
refractory multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma (2).
Next-generation proteasome inhibitors, such as ixazomib, are
currently under preclinical and clinical investigations. These novel
agents were developed with an objective of enhancing efﬁcacy and
improving the tolerability of antiproteasomal therapeutics (3–5).
Ixazomib is an investigational proteasome inhibitor currently in
clinical trials in hematologic malignancies and early reports
indicate promising clinical activities in follicular and T-cell lymphoma (6); however, its biologic activity in T-cell lymphoma and
Hodgkin lymphoma are largely unknown and the biologic
mechanisms are not well deﬁned.
T-cell lymphomas represent a heterogeneous group of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas with overall poor prognosis (7).
Further discovery of its tumor biology is needed and additional
novel targeted therapeutic agents are desired. Hodgkin lymphoma
is generally a curable malignancy by conventional chemotherapy;
however, there continues to be a subset of patients with refractory
disease or relapse that succumbs to this disease. In addition, there
remains an unmet need to identify targeted, less toxic therapy for
the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma to decrease the continued
acute and long-term toxicities associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation (7–9). Moreover, multiple preclinical studies strongly indicated that proteasome-dependent NF-kB may be a
'master switch' of Hodgkin Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells and it has

been shown to be critical for cell survival in HRS and also T-cell
lymphoma models (10–15). Although proteasome is a rationale
therapeutic target for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma, clinical studies in patients with these malignancies
treated with bortezomib were associated with modest clinical
beneﬁt (16, 17). With the development of ixazomib as secondgeneration proteasomal inhibitor with superior pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and tumor inhibitory properties in lymphoma
compared with bortezomib (18, 19), interest in the treatment of Tcell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma is renewed.
We utilized in vitro and in vivo tumor models to understand the
biologic mechanisms of action and antitumor activity of ixazomib in T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma, at clinically
relevant concentrations. Through global transcriptome and network analysis, we describe the impact of ixazomib on biologic
pathways and tumor progression in T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma cells. Furthermore, our investigation outlines
mechanisms of CHK1-dependent, MYC-regulated cell death
occurring via ixazomib and the associated critical implications
impacting cell signaling and drug sensitivity. The impact of
ixazomib on CHK1 and MYC is signiﬁcant in the context of other
previous studies indicating an existence of cooperative relationship between MYC and CHK1 as an important factor in driving
lymphomagenesis (20). Further sensitivity to CHK1 inhibition
has also been reported in lymphoma cells with MYC overexpression (21). Thus, with the ability to impact MYC and CHK1 as key
driving mechanisms of tumorigenesis in lymphoma, ixazomib is
a potential appealing antilymphoma agent.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, reagents, and transfections
Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines L540 and L428 and, T-cell
lymphoma cell lines HH, Hut78, and Jurkat were grown in
RPMI-1640 consisting of 10% heat-inactivated FBS and penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech) under 5% CO2 and 37 C. Cell lines
were authenticated using short tandem repeat (STR) proﬁling
service provided by ATCC. Ixazomib was kindly provided by
Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Belinostat, JQ1, and the CHK1
inhibitor, AZD7762, were purchased from Selleck Chemicals.
Nontargeting or MYC siRNAs were obtained from GE Healthcare,
and transfection was performed using Nucleofector device and
reagent kit L (Lonza).
MTT and apoptosis
MTT assay and Annexin V apoptosis detection were performed
as described previously (22). IC50 values and combination indices
for drug treatment were derived using Calcusyn Version 2.1
Software (Biosoft).
Lymphoma xenografts
For examination of the in vivo effect of ixazomib, human
lymphoma xenografts derived from Jurkat (T-cell lymphoma) or
L540 (Hodgkin lymphoma) grown in SCID mouse models
described previously (22) were treated with either saline (control)
or ixazomib (0.36 or 0.72 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections daily for 5 days for 3 weeks consisting 8 mice per group.
Animals observation, tumor, and body weight measurements,
and statistical analysis using GraphPad Prism 5.0, (GraphPad
Software, Inc.), were performed as described previously (22). To
quantify tumor growth, we used nonlinear regression to ﬁt the

3320 Cancer Res; 76(11) June 1, 2016

tumor growth phase data with curves of the form V ¼ bect, where V
is tumor volume and t is time (23). Here, c is interpreted as the
tumor growth rate once the tumor starts to grow more or less
exponentially; b is interpreted as the extrapolated 'effective' volume at the implant time, t ¼ 0.
Western blot analysis
Preparation of protein lysates and Western blot analysis was
performed, as described previously (22). Primary antibodies
against MYC, total or phospho CHK1 (Ser 345), total or acetylated
histone H3, b-actin, HDAC3, p62, Cathepsin D total and cleaved
caspase-3, 8, 9, PARP, and b-actin were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology.
Transcriptome analyses
Jurkat, L540, and L428 cells were treated in triplicates with 25
nmol/L ixazomib for 24 hours, RNA was isolated using RNeasy
Minikit (Qiagen), and microarray experiment was performed
using Affymetrix Human Gene Chip 2.0 (Jurkat and L540), or
Human HT 12 Genechip Illumina (L428). The raw expression
data from these experiments are available at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, with following identiﬁers
GSE66417 (Jurkat/L540) and GSE66415 (L428). Data for Jurkat
and L540 cell lines were background adjusted and quantile
normalized using RMAExpress (24). Statistically relevant genes
were determined by applying LIMMA (25) with an false discovery
rate (FDR) < 0.05. Data for the L428 cell line (part of a larger
dataset that was not used in this manuscript) was corrected
through normalization of the housekeeping genes, quantile normalized, and then statistically relevant genes were determined
with one-way ANOVA analysis with FDR < 0.05. Details on the
pathway analysis, networks, and the unbiased method to determine the key signiﬁcant genes are previously published in refs.
23, 26, 27.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and PCR assay
Sample preparation was performed using Pierce Agarose ChIP
Kit, Thermo Scientiﬁc, qRT-PCR was performed using primer set
(#PPH00100B) from SABiosciences, designed to amplify human
MYC promoter region proximal to transcription start site with
SYBR Green Mastermix (Roche), and using Roche LightCycler I.
For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), ChIP grade antibodies, Acetyl histone H3 K9 (#17-658) were purchased from EMD
Millipore, anti-RNA polymerase II and normal rabbit IgG were
supplied in Pierce Agarose ChIP kit and used as positive and
negative control, respectively.

Results
In vitro and in vivo efﬁcacy with therapy
Cell viability following exposure to ixazomib (12.5–1,000
nmol/L) for 72 hours in T-cell lymphoma cell lines (Jurkat,
Hut78, HH) and Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines (L428, L540)
resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability in all
cell lines (Fig. 1A and B). L540 cells were observed to be
most sensitive with associated 50% inhibitory effective dose
(ED) concentration ED50 of 25 nmol/L compared with HH
(41 nmol/L), Hut78 (52 nmol/L), Jurkat (38 nmol/L), and
L428 (117 nmol/L). Treatment with ixazomib resulted in
accumulation of ubiquitinylated protein as would be expected
with proteosomal inhibition (Fig. 1C). In addition, there was

induction of apoptosis in all lymphoma cell lines as detected by
Western blot analysis of caspase-3, -7, -8, and -9, and PARP
cleavage, except in L428 (Fig. 1C); this was conﬁrmed with
ixazomib-treated lymphoma cells using Annexin/PI staining
and ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 1D).
The in vivo efﬁcacy of ixazomib was investigated using tumor
xenografts derived using either Jurkat or L540 cell lines. Results
from Jurkat-derived xenograft experiments showed that after 4
weeks of ixazomib administration, there was a signiﬁcant reduction in the average approximate size of the tumor (1,094  76
mm3) with 0.36 mg/kg or (582  45 mm3) with 0.72 mg/kg
compared with the average size of tumor (1,465  224 mm3) in
the vehicle-treated control group (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1E). Kaplan–
Meier survival analysis showed a signiﬁcant improved survival in
SCID mice consisting Jurkat xenograft treated with ixazomib
compared with control group (P < 0.0001; Fig. 1F). Treatment
with ixazomib in L540 xenograft tumor-bearing SCID mice also
resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in the average size of the tumor
(821  54 mm3) with 0.36 mg/kg or (290  5 mm3) with 0.72
mg/kg compared with vehicle-administered control group (1,128
 162 mm3), at the end of 4 weeks (P ¼ <0.001; Fig. 1G). Kaplan–
Meier survival analysis showed a signiﬁcant increase in survival
with ixazomib treatment compared with control groups (P <
0.0001; Fig. 1H).
We also analyzed detailed tumor growth kinetics by comparing
tumor volumes measured before, during, and at the completion
of treatment. Ixazomib resulted in decreased average tumor
growth rate, 0.045  0.0060 with 0.36 mg/kg and signiﬁcantly
(P ¼ 0.002; 0.017  0.0060 with 0.72 mg/kg), compared with the
growth rate 0.049  0.0045 in the vehicle-administered control
group (Fig. 1I) consistent with inhibition of tumor progression in
L540. This indicates there will be steady decrease in tumor growth
with increasing doses of ixazomib. The kinetics of tumor growth
in the Jurkat xenograft, however, showed no signiﬁcant differences in growth rate (0.076  0.012 with 0.36 mg/kg and 0.056 
0.015 with 0.72 mg.kg) compared with the growth rate of 0.052 
0.006 vehicle-administered control group, suggesting that ixazomib is causing a lag time delay in the tumor growth rather than any
signiﬁcant change in the growth rate. It should be noted that this
prediction is obscured by large variances in the growth rates of
tumor observed in the ixazomib-treated cohorts (Fig. 1I).
Although ixazomib treatment appeared to affect the kinetics of
the tumor growth by causing a lag time delay in the Jurkatderived xenografts, comparison of average tumor size resulted
in overall reduction in the tumor burden and improved survival
beneﬁt (Fig. 1E and H), indicating antitumor activity of ixazomib in this model. The results from in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that proteasomal inhibition via ixazomib is
associated with strong activity against T-cell lymphoma and
Hodgkin lymphoma.
Transcriptome analyses of the impact of proteasomal
inhibition on biologic pathways and "hallmarks of cancer"
Global transcriptome analyses following ixazomib exposure
showed signiﬁcant gene changes with a 1.2 fold change for Jurkat
(508 genes), L540 (4765 genes), and L428 (423 genes; Fig. 2A)
with an FDR < 0.05. L540 with the highest signiﬁcantly differential
expressed genes was the most ixazomib-sensitive Hodgkin lymphoma line (Fig. 1A) with signiﬁcant inhibition of tumor growth
(Fig. 1I). Gene expression with ixazomib compared with untreated control showed a total of 40 overlapping genes with a 1.2 fold

www.aacrjournals.org

change difference in Jurkat, L540, and L428 cells, with 326
overlapping genes in Jurkat and L540, and 212 overlapping
gene sets in L428 and L540 Hodgkin lymphoma cells (Fig. 2B).
The overlap based on common signiﬁcantly regulated genes in
Jurkat, L540, and L428 cells treated with ixazomib showed
conserved upregulation of ubiquitin proteasome components
PSMB3, PSMB6, PSMC4, PSMD6, UBE2H, UBFD1, and lysosome-associated factors ATG4A, CD68, PSAP, and SQSTM1
(also known as p62; Fig. 2C; ref. 9), and these gene expression
changes were conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR–based assay (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Upstream regulator analysis performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and in conjunction with published data
reporting impact on tumor progression, (Fig. 3; Supplementary
Table S1) summarized the effects of ixazomib on tumor dynamics. Ixazomib treatment in Jurkat and L540 appeared to have
shifted the balance of upstream regulators associated with tumor
promotion and tumor suppression in favor of tumor inhibition
(Fig. 3A), supporting the tumor-inhibitory effects of ixazomib
observed with tumor xenografts (Fig. 1I). Conversely, the
responses in L428 with ixazomib appeared to favor tumor progression (Fig. 3). Next, the status of upstream regulators was
mapped on their functional contextual relationship to classical
"hallmarks of cancer" (28, 29). Results from this evaluation show
that ixazomib overwhelmingly impacts 9 of 12 "hallmarks of
cancer," (Fig. 4A), providing clues to tumor-inhibitory functions
of ixazomib in L540 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, ixazomib treatment in
L428 appears to promote the "self-sufﬁciency in growth signal"
favoring tumor progression (Fig. 4B). Although additional
experiments for a functional validation of these predictions
are required, it must be noted that there was an apparent lack of
apoptotic activity in L428 cells despite proteasomal inhibition
with ixazomib (as detected as accumulation of ubiquitinylated
protein; Fig. 1C). In fact, these cells demonstrated the lowest
sensitivity to ixazomib compared with other cell lines tested
(Fig. 1A and B). Interestingly, MYC inhibition represented
among several "hallmarks of cancer" present in L540 is notably
absent in L428 with ixazomib treatment (Fig. 4) and further
validated by qRT-PCR–based assay (Supplementary Fig. S1).
MYC is functionally associated with several oncogenic mechanisms associated with tumor progression (30), and inhibition of
MYC with ixazomib treatment could be an important event in
the antitumor activity of ixazomib.
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed conserved upregulation of biologic pathways representing protein localization,
proteasome, vesicle transport, apoptosis, oxidative stress, NF-kB,
and catabolic processes with ixazomib in both L540 and L428
cells (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S2; Supplementary Tables
S2 and S3). This included conservation of biologic pathways with
gene expression analysis using different and higher doses of
ixazomib in L428 and L540 (data not shown). Although biologic
pathways associated with DNA repair, mitotic cell cycle, and
microtubule organization oppositely regulated between L540 and
L428 Hodgkin lymphoma cells, such patterns of biologic
responses to ixazomib were consistently observed with GSEA
performed using multiple reference databases (KEGG, Reactome
and Biocarta; Supplementary Fig. S2; Supplementary Tables S2
and S3). In addition, GSEA predicted overall downregulation of
MYC pathway with ixazomib in L540 or Jurkat (Supplementary
Fig. S1C) as validated by qRT-PCR–based assay (Supplementary
Fig. S1).

Downregulation of MYC via proteosomal inhibition
Analysis of upstream regulators and GSEA with ixazomib
transcriptome predicted MYC inhibition in L540 and Jurkat
cells, but notably absent in L428 (Figs. 3 and 4) and validated
by qRT-PCR–based assay (Supplementary Fig. S1). MYC is an
important regulator of cell cycle, DNA repair, and replication,
chromatin modiﬁcation, inﬂammatory responses, lysosomal
autophagy, metabolism, and oxidative stress (32, 33), and
these pathways are also enriched with ixazomib treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, we next investigated the
biologic responses of these enriched pathways using ixazomib-treated panel of lymphoma cells. Results from our experiments showed that MYC protein levels decreased with increasing concentrations of ixazomib in all lymphoma cells, except
in the relatively less sensitive L428 cell line (Fig. 6A) consistent with transcriptional downregulation of MYC expression,
as determined by qRT-PCR–based assay (Supplementary Fig.
S1). A dose-dependent increase in lysosomal activity-associated Cathepsin D cleavage was observed in most of the cell
lines, with L428 showing increase in lysosomal autophagyrelated p62. Lysosomal activation could be relevant to MYC
downregulation with ixazomib as previous data showed that
MYC was a substrate in Cathepsin D–dependent proteolysis
(34); presumably the activation of lysosomal proteolysis by

3324 Cancer Res; 76(11) June 1, 2016

ixazomib could be relevant to downregulation of MYC protein
levels.
Proteasomal inhibition has been previously shown to inhibit
DNA damage response to IR via inhibition of CHK1 phosphorylation (35) and our results from GSEA show downregulation of
genes associated with DNA damage, DNA repair and cell-cycle
progression with ixazomib (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S2;
Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). We examined inhibition of
CHK1 phosphorylation as a marker for these responses (36) and
observed inhibition of CHK1 phosphorylation in all cell lines
with ixazomib treatment except in L428 (Fig. 6A). Histone H3
acetylation, a marker of chromatin modiﬁcation, which is regulated by CHK1 (37) and affects MYC expression (38), was also
decreased with increasing concentrations of ixazomib in Jurkat,
HH, and Hut78 and L540 cells, without signiﬁcant effect in L428
cells (Fig. 6A). Collectively, these results suggest that biologic
responses of MYC, lysosome, cell cycle, and chromatin modiﬁcation correlate with each other and are conserved in ixazomib Tcell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines, while such
conservation was lacking in L428 cells, exactly as predicted from
GSEA (Fig. 5) and DAVID analysis (Supplementary Table S5)
Lysosomal activity represents as alternate means for protein
degradation and therefore, excess protein accumulation resulting
from proteasomal inhibition is expected to trigger lysosomal

of lysosomal protease with E64d/Pepstatin CHK1 did not result in
MYC accumulation but rather led to accelerated reduction in MYC
protein and histone H3 acetylation, and enhanced apoptosis,
detected as cleaved caspase-3 and PARP in ixazomib-treated Jurkat
and L428 cells (Fig. 6C). There was no corresponding HDAC
accumulation with decreased histone H3 acetylation with lysosomal inhibition (Fig. 6C), suggesting HDAC-independent reduction of histone H3 acetylation with ixazomib. Taken together,
inhibition of proteasomal and lysosomal proteolysis, instead of
resulting in MYC accumulation resulted in further loss of MYC
protein, indicating a possible role for transcriptional regulation of
MYC expression with ixazomib treatment.
Next, we focused our investigation on the cell-cycle regulatory
CHK1 in the context of MYC function, because MYC and CHK1
interaction is a known oncogenic mechanism in lymphomagenesis (20), the role of CHK1 in transcriptional regulation via
histone H3 acetylation is known (37), and histone H3 acetylation
is required for MYC transcription (33). We examined genes
regulated by MYC and CHK1 in ixazomib-treated cells and
observed strong overlap in the target gene sets regulated by MYC
and CHK1. There was overall downregulation of MYC-associated
genes in both L540 (53%) and Jurkat (5%) and upregulation of
MYC-associated genes in L428 (6%; Fig. 6D and E). Similarly,

3326 Cancer Res; 76(11) June 1, 2016

there was overall downregulation of CHK1-associated genes in
both L540 (47%) and Jurkat (11%) and upregulation of CHK1associated genes in L428 (7%; Fig. 6D and E). By comparing MYC
and CHK1-regulated genes, we noted the presence of overlapping
gene sets in L540 (20%), Jurkat (7%), and L428 (33%). Considering the strong overlap and the pattern of differentially expressed
gene sets representing both MYC and CHK1, we narrowed our
investigation to determine the biologic relationship between
these oncogenes.
MYC promoter binding and importance of CHK1
We investigated the effect of CHK1 inhibition on histone H3
acetylation and MYC in L428 cells treated with ixazomib. We
observed that CHK1 inhibitor (AZD7762) alone, or in combination with ixazomib, strongly downregulated histone H3 acetylation, phosphorylation of CHK1-dependent Threonine 11 (37), on
histone H3, and MYC protein (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, inhibition
of histone acetyl transferase (HAT) by C646 also resulted in
downregulation of MYC (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating that
CHK1 and histone H3 acetylation are upstream in the regulation
of MYC expression. Therefore, we performed ChIP using antiacetylated histone H3 and PCR assay for its binding on the MYC
promoter region. We observed that ixazomib treatment resulted

in decreased MYC ampliﬁcation relative to untreated Jurkat control cells (Fig. 7B), indicating reduced MYC promoter occupancy
by acetylated histone H3 as a possible mechanism for ixazomibdependent downregulation of MYC expression in the Jurkat cells.
In contrast, we noted increased PCR ampliﬁcation of MYC in L428
cells, indicating higher promoter occupancy by acetyl histone H3,
suggesting an active transcription process with ixazomib (Fig. 7B).
Our conclusions based on the results from the ChIP experiment
showed decreased and increased promoter occupancy in Jurkat
and L428 (Fig. 7B), respectively, which are consistent with the
patterns of MYC-dependent gene expression observed in these
cells (Fig. 6A and D), indicate that MYC function is regulated at the
level of transcription with ixazomib treatment. Because we
observed that ixazomib treatment resulted in downregulation of
MYC and CHK1 phosphorylation in all lymphoma cells, except in
L428 cells, we chose to examine the consequences of blocking
CHK1 on MYC expression in L428 cells. Previous analyses demonstrated a direct role for CHK1 kinase activity in histone H3
phosphorylation (Threonine 11) and stabilization of histone H3
acetylation to facilitate transcription via retention of relaxed
chromatin conﬁrmation (37). Therefore, we performed ChIP PCR
assay for MYC, in the presence of AZD7762 (CHK1 inhibitor) to
determine whether CHK1-dependent histone modiﬁcation
affects MYC expression. The results from our experiments show
decreased MYC promoter occupancy by acetylated-Histone compared with untreated control, or in the presence of ixazomib in
L428 cells (Fig. 7C). Taken together, these results demonstrated
that CHK1 inhibition leading to decreased histone H3 acetylation
and MYC expression (Fig. 7A) is associated with decreased promoter occupancy on MYC gene (Fig. 7C), suggesting that CHK1 is
actively involved in the transcriptional control of MYC in the
ixazomib-treated lymphoma cells.
CHK1 or MYC inhibition synergizes with antiproteasomal
therapy
Considering that CHK1 phosphorylation and MYC expression
were not affected by ixazomib treatment in L428 (Fig. 6A and D),
and L428 showed least sensitivity to ixazomib (by MTT and
Apoptosis; Fig. 1B and C) compared with other lymphoma cells,
we predicted that a combination CHK1 inhibitor and ixazomib is
likely to downregulate MYC and restore ixazomib sensitivity in
the L428 Hodgkin lymphoma cells. Therefore, we treated L428
cells with increasing doses of ixazomib alone and in presence of
CHK1 inhibitor, AZD7762, and observed a signiﬁcant increase in
Annexin—positive apoptosis (P < 0.001) in the combination of
ixazomib with AZD7762 compared with controls (Fig. 7D). Next
considering that MYC downregulation is predicted as a prominent
mechanism in ixazomib sensitivity, and we used JQ1 (bromodomain inhibitor, blocks MYC transcription) to inhibit MYC
expression and observed potentiation of apoptosis, detected as
cleaved PARP, both in Jurkat (T-cell lymphoma) and L428 Hodgkin lymphoma cells in the presence of ixazomib (Fig. 7E). Furthermore, these results were independently conﬁrmed using
RNAi-mediated silencing of MYC or CHK1 (Fig. 7F). Considering
that MYC downregulation and cotargeting of MYC could be clinically relevant for ixazomib-based treatments, we ﬁnally investigated
to determine whether such targeted drug combinations would be
synergistic. Our results based on MTT assays show that targeting
CHK1 with AZD7762 (ED50 1.1 mmol/L) in the presence of ixazomib was synergistic (CI < 1) in L428 Hodgkin lymphoma cells (Fig.
7G and H) and similarly, combination of JQ1 (ED50 5.5 mmol/L)

www.aacrjournals.org

with ixazomib also resulted in synergistic effect (CI < 1) in L428
(Fig. 7I and J), suggesting that AZD7762 or JQ1-dependent MYC
downregulation will lead to synergistic cell death in ixazomibrefractory L428 cells, with dominant MYC function.

Discussion
The prominent substrates regulated by proteasome-dependent
turnover includes key proteins involved in the regulation of
replication, transcription, translation, cell cycle, tumor suppression, signal transduction, apoptosis, metabolism among others
(40). NF-kB has been shown to be constitutively active in Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines and also critical for HRS cell survival in
xenograft studies (10, 11). Furthermore, NF-kB has been shown to
be highly overexpressed and responsible for tumorigenesis in
both HRS and T-cell lymphoma models (14, 15). Despite these
promising preclinical data, proteosomal inhibition with bortezomib had only modest clinical activity in Hodgkin lymphoma
(16, 17), while more encouraging clinical activity has been
reported in T-cell lymphoma (41, 42). To exploit the strong and
functional presence of NF-kB in Hodgkin lymphoma and T-cell
lymphoma, which is regulated by the proteasome, we examined
the effects of the novel second-generation orally bioactive proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib, which has superior pharmacokinetics/
pharmacodynamics compared with bortezomib (18). Considering also that early reports from ixazomib lymphoma clinical
studies have been encouraging (6), the results from our analyses
provide the biologic basis and the mechanisms of activity of
ixazomib activity.
Results herein demonstrated that ixazomib induced potent cell
death and inhibited tumor growth in T-cell lymphoma and
Hodgkin lymphoma cells at clinically achievable nanomolar
concentrations. Transcriptome analysis showed conserved and
consistent biologic responses with ixazomib in both T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma cells. Furthermore, the activation status of tumor suppressors and inhibition of oncogenes
indicated strong potential for the inhibition of tumor progression
with ixazomib in T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma and
substantial impact were predicted on overall global "hallmarks of
cancer." Although we observed conserved biologic regulations
with ixazomib treatment in Jurkat and L540 cells, we also noted
that a lack of conservation with biologic responses, associated
with minimal impact on the 'hallmarks of cancer' was related to
poor sensitivity to ixazomib in L428 cells.
We postulated that examining the biologic differences in
response to ixazomib in the differentially sensitive lymphoma
cells could provide clues to determine the associated biologic
mechanisms of actions to ixazomib treatment. Constitutive
expression of NF-kB has been commonly observed in Hodgkin
lymphoma cells including L428 (43). Furthermore, we observed
induction of NF-kB genes with ixazomib treatment in both
ixazomib-sensitive L540 and -resistant L428 Hodgkin lymphoma
cells (Fig. 5A), and we subsequently veriﬁed that NF-kB activation
occurs in ixazomib-treated multiple T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma cells as shown by Western blot assays (data not
shown) thus ruling out a signiﬁcant role for NF-kB in resistance to
ixazomib. Among the signiﬁcant upstream regulators affected
with ixazomib, inactivation of MYC, which was predicted in
Jurkat and L540 cells, were absent in L428. MYC is central to
major regulatory pathways including cell cycle, DNA repair,
replication, transcription and translation, and metabolism (44)

with global impact on major "hallmarks of cancer" progression
(30). MYC is transcriptionally regulated by cell-cycle regulatory
proteins (p21, CHK1, CDC2) through chromatin modiﬁcation
via histone acetylation (37) and BRCA1 pathways (45).
We demonstrated that ixazomib affected many of the aforementioned MYC-related biologic pathways and expression of
MYC protein (Fig. 6A). Overexpression of MYC occurs in 30%
of all human cancers and frequently predicts for aggressive biologic behavior, advanced stage of disease, increased likelihood of
relapse, and poor clinical outcome (46, 47). Studies in transgenic
mouse models showed that even brief MYC inactivation is sufﬁcient to induce tumor regressions (48) and that targeting MYC
may destabilize apoptosis regulatory network and induce cell
death in lymphoma (49). In multiple myeloma, a correlation
between MYC overexpression (50) and poor response to treatment with bortezomib has been reported, and in mantle cell
lymphoma, cotargeting MYC with (CPI203) was shown to overcome bortezomib resistance (51). Although these studies show a
correlation between MYC and resistance to proteasome inhibition, results from our experiments demonstrated the biologic
mechanism for MYC-dependent resistance to proteasome inhibition, and moreover, how to circumvent these mechanisms to
improve therapeutic response.
In L428 cells, poor sensitivity to ixazomib correlated with lack
of MYC regulation and histone H3 acetylation. Both histone
acetylation and MYC affect similar downstream biologic processes including, chromatin modiﬁcation, gene expression, DNA
replication and repair, cell cycle, cytoskeletal function, and protein trafﬁcking (52). Chromatin modiﬁcation involving histone
acetylation is mediated by a family of HATs and HDACs with
opposing enzymatic activities, and histone acetylation is an
important mechanism in the regulation of MYC gene expression
(52). Furthermore, the cell-cycle regulatory CHK1 is known to
regulate histone acetylation via histone H3 phosphorylation (37),
which leads to HDAC3 disassociation favoring MYC transcription
(38). Thus, in our experiments, CHK1 inhibition alone or in the
presence of ixazomib, decreased MYC promoter occupancy (by
acetylated histone H3) and reduced MYC protein in L428 (Fig. 7A
and D). Furthermore, by using pharmacologic inhibitors and
RNAi for CHK1 and MYC, we demonstrated that MYC downregulation was required for inducing cell death with ixazomib. In

addition, CHK1 inhibition has been reported to enhance cytotoxicity with lenalidomide selectively in MYC-dependent lymphoma (53), supporting the role for CHK1 dependency in MYCdriven tumors. Altogether, results from our analyses showed that
ixazomib alone or in combination with CHK1 inhibition has the
potential to signiﬁcantly downregulate MYC and induce potent
cell death in T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma models,
and it represents a novel combinatorial therapeutic platform for
the treatment of these cancers.
