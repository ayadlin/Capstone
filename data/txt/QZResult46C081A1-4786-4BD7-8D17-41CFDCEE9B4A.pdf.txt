BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in children. Despite the advent of chemotherapy, the survival of osteosarcoma patients has not been significantly improved recently. Chemokines are a group
of signaling molecules that have been implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis. METHODS: The authors used an
antibody microarray to identify chemokines that were elevated in the plasma samples of osteosarcoma patients. The
results were validated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays on an independent set of samples. The tumor
expressions of 3 chemokines were examined in 2 sets of osteosarcoma tissue arrays. The authors also evaluated the
proliferative effect of the chemokines in 4 osteosarcoma cell lines. RESULTS: The authors found that the plasma levels of CXCL4, CXCL6, and CXCL12 in the osteosarcoma patients were significantly higher than those in the controls,
and the results were validated by an independent osteosarcoma cohort (P < .05). However, CXCL4 (100%) and
CXCL6 (91%) were frequently expressed in osteosarcoma, whereas CXCL12 was only expressed in 4%. Survival analysis further showed that higher circulating levels of CXCL4 and CXCL6, but not CXCL12, were associated with a poorer
outcome of osteosarcoma patients. Addition of exogenous chemokines significantly promoted the growth of different osteosarcoma cells (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that CXCL4 and CXCL6 are frequently
expressed in osteosarcoma, and that the plasma levels of these 2 chemokines are associated with patient outcomes.
Further study of these circulating chemokines may provide a promising approach for prognostication of osteosarcoma. Targeting these chemokines or their receptors may also lead to a novel therapeutic invention. Cancer

Osteosarcoma (OS) is a primary malignant tumor of bone arising from primitive bone-forming mesenchymal
cells.1 OS is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents, with an annual incidence rate of 5.6
per million, and accounts for 60% of pediatric bone tumors.2 OS is a devastating disease, characterized by a high local
aggressiveness and tendency to metastasize to the lungs and distant bones. Despite recent advances in multimodality treatments consisting of adjuvant chemotherapy and surgical resection, pulmonary metastasis occurs in approximately 40% to
50% of patients. In such cases, the overall 5-year survival rate is only 28%.3,4 Previous studies have found specific populations that are at higher risks of developing OS, such as patients harboring certain gene mutations (TP53,5 RB,6 or
RECQL47). Identification of tumor-derived factors that are associated with OS will likely improve the diagnosis and treatment of this deadly disease.
Cytokines are secreted or membrane-bound proteins that are released in response to a diverse range of cellular
stresses, including inflammation and malignancy. These proteins regulate the growth, differentiation, and activation of
immune cells in response to specific cellular stimuli. Chemokines are a family of cytokine-like proteins that selectively
attract and activate different cell types, including immune cells. By interacting with G-protein–coupled receptors, chemokines can affect various cellular processes, such as cytoskeleton rearrangement, directional cell migration, and cell

adhesion.8,9 Some chemokines can promote proliferation,
angiogenesis, metastasis, or immunosuppression in cancer, whereas other chemokines inhibit tumor-mediated
angiogenesis and promote antitumor immune
responses.8-11 CXC chemokines contain 2 highly conserved cysteine residues separated by a nonconserved
amino-acid residue (cysteine-X-cysteine sequence) at the
N-terminus.12 The CXC chemokines are small proteins
with a functional ability of activating and directing chemotaxis of different cells including leukocytes.13 In OS,
addition of a CXCR4 inhibitor or antagonist can significantly inhibit the development of lung metastasis in
mouse models.14,15 In this study, we tested if other cytokines and/or chemokines were also associated with OS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Samples
The sample and patient information used in this study is
listed in Tables 1 and 2. The human plasma samples were
collected at initial diagnosis from 33 OS patients who
were enrolled from 3 collaborating institutions, namely
Texas Children’s Hospital (Houston, Tex), Cook Children’s Medical Center (Fort Worth, Tex), and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (Oklahoma
City, Okla). Patients were 7 to 22 years of age at diagnosis.
Twenty-one plasma samples from anonymized hospitalized pediatric patients with noncancerous diseases (well
child checkup, flu, constipation, gastroenteritis, and febrile seizure) were collected from Texas Children’s Hospital and used as noncancerous disease controls. All patients
gave consent to institutional review board-approved protocols. All plasma samples were collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-containing tubes at room
temperature and immediately centrifuged at 1000 rpm
for 10 minutes. The plasma supernatant was stored at
80 C until use. Five human plasma samples from
healthy 18-year-old donors were used as healthy controls

208

in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) validation (Equitech-Bio, Kerrville, Tex).
Serum samples used in an independent test set were
collected by the Children’s Oncology Group under the
protocol P9581 from multiple institutions. All 51 serum
samples used in this study were collected at the time of diagnosis from OS patients who were 4 to 22 years of age
(Tables 1 and 2). Eleven serum samples from 18-year-old
healthy donors (Equitech-Bio) were also used as healthy
controls in the validation phase. The serum and plasma
samples were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the quality and protein patterns between the 2 sets of samples were very
similar (data not shown).
RayBio Antibody Array Analysis
Biotin Label-Based Human Antibody Array I (RayBiotech, Norcross, Ga) was used to detect 507 human proteins in plasma, as in the manufacturer’s manual. In this
study, 33 OS and 21 noncancerous disease control plasma
samples were pooled separately and hybridized with the
array. The spot signals were detected using a ScanArray
Express Microarray Scanner (PerkinElmer, Waltham,
Mass). Duplicated experiments were performed for each
sample. The median minus background intensities of all
the experiments were log-2 transformed and quantile-normalized. The intra-array coefficients of variation ranged
from 9.8% to 13.9%. The correlation coefficients of the
spot intensities in the replicate experiments of the control
and the tumor samples were 0.94 and 0.93, respectively
(data not shown), suggesting that the data generated from
the array platform were reproducible. Intensity ratios
between OS and noncancerous disease controls of each
experiment were used to identify candidate biomarkers.
The P values were calculated using 2-sample t test. In the
antibody study, the candidate biomarkers were identified
with a P value <.005 and fold change >1.4 to adjust for
multiple testing.

ELISA Verification and Validation
The CXCL4 concentrations were determined using the
IMUCLONE Platelet Factor 4 ELISA kit (America Diagnostica, Stamford, Conn). The CXCL6 and CXCL12
concentrations were determined using Human GCP-2/
CXCL6 and CXCL12/SDF-1 alpha Quantikine Immunoassay kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn),
respectively.
Statistical Analysis
The intensity values were analyzed using 2-sample t test.
A P value <.05 was considered to be significant. The survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier estimation, and the significance was calculated by the logrank test using SPSS (Chicago, Ill) statistical software.
The cutoffs for the survival analysis were based on the second or third quartile of the chemokine concentration data
from the OS patients. The quartile was chosen based on
manual inspection to identify the best separation of the
survival groups.

(RMS) cases (Children’s Oncology Group). The staining
was performed using the VECTASTAIN ABC system
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif). Each of the
mouse antihuman monoclonal primary antibodies for
CXCL4 (Abcam, Cambridge, Mass), CXCL6, and
CXCL12 (R&D Systems) was diluted to 10 lg/mL. Immunostaining score was calculated based on the sum of
the proportion score of positive cells and the intensity
score of the staining by the pathologist (J.H.). The proportion score of positive cells was classified as 0 when <1% of
stained cells were observed within the tumor, 1 when 1%
to 25% of the tumor cells were positive, 2 when 25% to
50% of the tumor cells were positive, 3 when 50% to 75%
of the tumor cells were positive, and 4 when >75% of the
tumor cells were positive. The intensity score was classified
as 0, 1, 2, and 3 for trace staining (background or minimal), weak staining, moderate staining, and strong staining, respectively. The results of staining in tumor cells
were subdivided into 3 groups as follows: negative if
scored 0, weak if scored 1 to 4, and strong if scored 5 to 7.

Immunohistochemistry
Two sets of paraffin-embedded OS tissue arrays were used
in this study. One array contains 49 OS and 28 chondrosarcoma cases (Biomax, Rockville, Md). The other OS tissue array contains 64 OS and 10 rhabdomyosarcoma

10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif).
Cell proliferation was measured by Cell Counting Kit-8
(Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Rockville, Md). For
each OS cell line, 6 replicates of 5000 cells were seeded
into 96-well flat-bottomed plates in DMEM without fetal
bovine serum. Each of the recombinant human CXCL4,
CXCL6, and CXCL12 (R&D Systems) samples was
reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline containing
0.2% human serum albumin. After overnight culture,
cells were treated with 1 lg/mL of CXCL4, CXCL6, or
CXCL12 for 24 hours. 0.2% of human serum albumin in
phosphate-buffered saline was used as a control. Then 10
lL of CCK-8 in 100 lL of the medium was added to each
well for 3 hours. The absorbance of each of the reactions
was measured at the wavelength of 450 nm.

RESULTS
Identification of Circulating Biomarkers
for OS Using Antibody Arrays
To identify OS-associated chemokines or cytokines, we
analyzed a pooled OS sample and a pooled noncancerous
disease control sample on antibody arrays (Table 1). By
measuring the signals of the 507 proteins on the array, we
identified 20 differentially abundant proteins in the

210

plasma of OS patients when compared with those in noncancerous disease controls. Among these 20 proteins, 8
were higher and 12 were lower in the OS patients (Table 3). Interestingly, 3 of the 8 elevated proteins were
members of the CXC chemokine family. They were
CXCL4 or platelet factor 4 (OS/noncancerous disease
controls ¼ 1.7), CXCL6 or granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (OS/noncancerous disease controls ¼ 2.1), and
CXCL12 or stromal cell derived factor-1 (OS/noncancerous disease controls ¼ 1.4) (Fig. 1A). Ten other CXC
chemokines detected by the array (CXCL1, CXCL5,
CXCL7, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11,
CXCL13, CXCL14, and CXCL16) did not show any differential abundance between the OS patients and the noncancerous disease controls.
Validation of the 3 CXC Chemokines
To confirm the antibody array results, we used ELISAs to
measure the concentrations of the 3 chemokines in each
of the plasma samples. We also included 5 plasma samples
from 18-year-old healthy donors to determine the baseline levels of these 3 chemokines in normal and healthy
individuals. The ELISA results showed that higher concentrations of the 3 chemokines were significantly associated with OS patients relative to both the noncancerous
disease controls and healthy controls (P < .05; Fig. 1A).
For instance, CXCL4 in the OS samples was 2.8-fold and
69.8-fold higher than in the noncancerous disease controls and healthy controls, respectively (Table 4). We also
observed that the levels of CXCL4 and CXCL6, but not
CXCL12, in the noncancerous disease controls were
higher than in the healthy controls, suggesting that these 2
chemokines may also react to other noncancerous conditions. Nonetheless, the 2 chemokines in the OS samples
were significantly higher than in the noncancerous disease
controls samples (P < .05, Table 4).
Next, we tested if we could validate the chemokine
results in an independent test set of OS patients obtained
from the Children’s Oncology Group. A comparison
between 51 OS and 11 healthy controls serum samples
showed that all 3 chemokines were significantly higher in
the OS patients relative to the controls (P < .05, Fig. 1B).
For instance, CXCL4 was 62.5-fold higher in the OS
samples when compared with the healthy controls.
Although the equivalent of noncancerous disease controls
samples was not available for the validation study, the fold
changes of the 3 chemokines between OS and healthy
controls in the discovery and validation sets were very consistent (Table 4).

Expression of the 3 Chemokines in OS Tissues
We tested if these circulating chemokines play a direct
role in the tumor by examining their expressions in OS
tissues on 2 sets of OS tissue arrays. The first OS tissue
array (Biomax) contains 49 OS and 28 chondrosarcoma
cases (Fig. 2). The second OS tissue array (Children’s
Oncology Group) contains 64 OS and 10 rhadomyosarcoma (RMS) cases (Fig. 2). For CXCL4, 82% and

Cancer

88% of OS cases had a strong CXCL4 expression in
the Biomax and Children’s Oncology Group arrays,
respectively (Table 5). Most of the strong expression
cases were because of high proportions of positive cells
(proportion score of positive cells ¼ 3-4) with a medium to high expression of CXCL4 (intensity
score ¼ 2-3; Table 6). We also observed a high expression of CXCL4 in all 10 RMS cases tested; however,

The 3 Chemokines Promote Proliferation
of OS Cells In Vitro
We further tested if the 3 chemokines could stimulate the
proliferation of 4 commonly used OS cell lines (U2-OS,
SaOS-2, MG-63, SJSA). The results showed that all 3
chemokines significantly promoted the cell proliferation
in all 4 OS cell lines (P < .05, Fig. 3). These results suggest that a high level of these chemokines in the local tumor environment or circulation may promote the tumor
growth in the patients.
CXCL4 and CXCL6 Were Associated With
the Patient Outcome
Our expression and functional results argue that these
chemokines may play a role in the prognosis of OS
patients. We therefore correlated the plasma levels of these
3 chemokines with the overall survival of the OS patients
in the discovery set, where we had clinical follow-up information. We found that the higher levels of both CXCL4
(P ¼ .007) and CXCL6 (P ¼ .03), but not CXCL12
(P ¼ .282), were significantly associated with a poor outcome (Fig. 4). These results were consistent with our findings that only CXCL4 and CXCL6 are expressed
frequently and strongly in OS tissues. We then tested if
the correlation of the poor outcome was because of an
association with the metastatic disease at diagnosis in these
patients. However, none of the 3 chemokines significantly
correlated with metastasis.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we identified 20 proteins that were differentially abundant in the OS plasma samples. Some of these
proteins have been reported to correlate with cancer, such
as TGF-beta RIII16 and Smad4.17 Among the 8 elevated
proteins in OS, 3 of them (CXCL4, CXCL6, and
Cancer

January 1, 2011

CXCL12) belong to the CXC chemokine family. By using
ELISA, we validated that the higher levels of the 3 chemokines were associated with OS in the independent test set.
These findings suggest that these 3 CXC chemokines may
be useful for early diagnosis of OS. This is particularly important for children with a known predisposition to OS,
such as patients harboring germline mutations in the
TP5318 or RB,19 or Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome
patients with RECQL5 mutations.20 A blood-based assay
of high-risk individuals may allow more timely and periodic monitoring of the disease and save lives. However,
further studies of the circulating chemokines in patients
with other sarcomas or bone diseases will be needed to test
if the chemokines are specific to OS.
Previous studies have reported that CXCL4 is elevated in a variety of gynecologic malignancies21,22 and
prostate cancer23; however, its role in OS is largely
unknown. The primary function of CXCL4 is involved in
platelet activation.24 In our study, CXCL4 was consistently increased in the OS patients of both the discovery
and validation sets (60-fold higher). The serum samples
used in the validation phase suggest that the higher level
of this chemokines in OS patients was not because of platelet contamination of the plasma samples. In fact, the elevation of CXCL4 is consistent with the enhanced platelet
activation observed in cancer patients that contributes to
the increased occurrence of thromboembolic events.25
Increased platelets may also provide protection of metastatic cells in the circulation.26,27
Interestingly, CXCL6 was first discovered from the
culture medium of the OS cell line MG-63 after stimulation with interleukin-1b.28 Our results showed that
CXCL6 was expressed in OS. However, a strong CXCL6
expression was observed in a higher proportion of OS
samples in the Children’s Oncology Group array (82%)
than those from the Biomax array (35%). This may reflect

the heterogeneity of the OS cases used in different arrays,
or that the expression of CXCL6 in OS is inherently more
variable. We have also observed that the tumor expression
patterns of CXCL4 and CXCL6 share some similarities.
The expressions of the 2 chemokines in OS are moderately correlated (r ¼ 0.37 in the Children’s Oncology
Group array and r ¼ 0.56 in the Biomax array), which is
consistent with the finding that both CXCL4 and
CXCL6 genes are located at the 4q12-q13, whereas
CXCL12 is located at 10q11.1.29
CXCL12 is secreted by stromal cells from a variety
of tissues, such as bone marrow, lung, and liver.30 The
chemotactic effect of CXCL12 is mediated by interaction

214

with its receptor CXCR4. The involvement of the
CXCR4/CXCL12 axis has been implicated in tumor progression of a variety of cancers and cancer stem cells.31,32
In OS, the migration of OS cells expressing CXCR4 receptor follows the CXCL12 gradient, and the adhesion of
OS cells to endothelial and bone marrow stromal cells is
promoted by a CXCL12 treatment. By using mouse models, the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis was proved to be involved
in the metastatic process of OS cells, as development of
lung metastasis was significantly decreased in the OS
mouse models by the administration of a CXCR4 inhibitor or antagonist.15,33 An earlier study has found that
CXCR4 is highly expressed in metastatic OS,34 and lung

expresses CXCL12.35 These findings are consistent with
our results that most OS cases did not express CXCL12.
The increased level of CXCL12 in the peripheral blood of
OS patients may be derived from other host tissues, such
as lung or metastasized OS cells.
Our results suggest that these chemokines may play
a direct functional role in OS tumorigenesis. Platelet
CXCL4 has been found to be elevated in the early tumor
growth of liposarcoma, breast cancer, and OS.36 CXCL6
can induce expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen
in small cell lung cancer cell lines in vitro,37 and melanoma cell growth in vivo.38 In addition, CXCL12 induces
proliferation in some tumor cell lines, such as ovarian carcinoma39 and nonsmall cell lung cancer.40 To test if the
CXC chemokines had a general proliferative effect on tumor cells, we repeated the proliferation assay using 3 different types of non-OS cell lines available in our
laboratory. They were TC7 (Ewing), HepG (liver hepatocellular carcinoma), and DAOY (medulloblastoma). Our
results showed that the 3 chemokines significantly
increased the proliferation of TC7 cells only, having no
effects on the HepG and DAOY cells (data not shown).
These results suggest that the 3 CXC chemokines only
promote growth for certain types of tumors. A recent
study has shown that many chemokine receptors are
expressed in OS, such as CXCR3, CXCR4, and
CXCR5.41 However, CXCR1, the cognate receptor of
CXCL6, was not reported. The receptor for CXCL4 in
the tumor cell is still not clear. Peptide-based or small
molecules that can inhibit the functions of the chemokines or receptors may provide an alternative and effective
therapy for OS patients who have a higher level of these
chemokines.42 For instance, inhibitor molecules of
CXCR4, the receptor of CXCL12, have been already used
in 4 clinical trials for various cancers (ClinicalTrials.gov
database). Therefore, the development of inhibitors for
other chemokines in OS is feasible. Because there is no
targeted therapy for OS other than chemotherapy, our
findings provide a foundation for future studies of these
chemokines and their receptors, which may lead to a novel
therapeutic approach to stop tumor growth in OS.
Our results showed that both CXCL4 and CXCL6
significantly correlated with patient outcomes; however,
no associations between these 2 chemokines and the metastatic status at diagnosis were found. The high expression
of these 2 chemokines in the tumor and plasma of OS
patients may exert a strong proliferative effect and promote tumor progression and, hence, a poorer outcome of
the patients. In contrast, plasma CXCL12 is likely to be

215

Original Article

expressed by other parts of the body, and the difference
between the plasma levels of the protein in OS patients
and healthy controls was relatively small when compared
with the other 2 chemokines (Table 4); thus, the plasma
level of CXCL12 did not significantly correlate with the
patient outcomes. Despite the promising results in this
study, we understand that our results were based on a relatively small group of patients, and thus they need to be
interpreted with caution. A larger patient cohort is needed
to validate the use of CXCL4 and CXCL6 as prognostic
factors in OS. We have collaborated with the Children’s
Oncology Group to use the samples collected from the
European and North American OS Study to validate these
findings.
