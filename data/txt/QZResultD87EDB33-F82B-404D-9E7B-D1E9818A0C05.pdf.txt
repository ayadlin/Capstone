ABSTRACT
Targeted treatment of advanced melanoma could benefit from the precise
molecular characterization of melanoma samples. Using a melanoma-specific
selection of 217 genes, we performed targeted deep sequencing of a series of
biopsies, from advanced melanoma cases, with a Breslow index of ≥4 mm, and/or
with a loco-regional infiltration in lymph nodes or presenting distant metastasis, as
well of a collection of human cell lines. This approach detected 3–4 mutations per
case, constituting unique mutational signatures associated with specific inhibitor
sensitivity. Functionally, case-specific combinations of inhibitors that simultaneously
targeted MAPK-dependent and MAPK-independent mechanisms were most effective
at inhibiting melanoma growth, against each specific mutational background. These
observations were challenged by characterizing a freshly resected biopsy from a
metastatic lesion located in the skin and soft tissue and by testing its associated
therapy ex vivo and in vivo using melanocytes and patient-derived xenografted mice,
respectively.
The results show that upon mutational characterization of advanced
melanoma patients, specific mutational profiles can be used for selecting drugs
that simultaneously target several deregulated genes/pathways involved in tumor
generation or progression.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Melanoma is a form of cancer whose incidence is
rising each year in the developed world, and is second to
leukemia in terms of loss of years of potential life from
cancers [1]. Despite recent improvements in mortality
rates, current deaths from melanoma are estimated to
comprise 85% of all cancers affecting the skin. This
is corroborated by the poor survival associated with
melanoma when diagnosed at an advanced stage [2].
Therefore, the development of effective therapies is a
major challenge in this field.
Molecular diagnostics of cancer have proved
that targeted therapies can be effective in many cancer
settings, as measured by the recent improvement in
cancer survival statistics (World Cancer Statistics
2008; ICD-10 C18–21). The use of EGFR inhibitors
in lung cancer [3, 4] and Imatinib in chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) patients [5] are two relevant examples.
Targeted therapies in melanoma are mostly directed
towards inhibiting MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling (MAPK
hereafter), [6]. Mutational analyses have recently enabled
the detection of up to 50% of malignant melanomas
carrying an activating mutation in BRAF [7], and these
can now be treated with specific B-RAF inhibitors [8].
In the clinic, this targeted approach, even when used in
combination with MEK inhibitors, is of limited benefit to
patient survival and, after a period, the cancer reappears
aggressively [9–11].
From a molecular perspective, data from Next
Generation Sequencing (NGS) show that more mutated
genes than initially expected participate in tumorigenesis,
including that of melanoma [12–14]. This involves a
dynamic process of subclonal competition that eventually
dictates multifactorial clinical resistance to B-RAF
inhibitors, which is dependent on reactivation of MAPK
signaling or other proliferative and/or pro-survival
pathways [15–17].
Taking advantage of available melanoma
NGS data, we characterized biopsies from advanced
melanoma patients and cell lines by studying the
presence of somatic mutations in a selected group of
genes. We thereby detected unique signatures of mutated
genes that are potentially associated with specific
inhibitors, and explored the effects of case-specific
combinations of the latter ex vivo and in vivo. Guided
by individual mutational profiles, tailored combinations
of inhibitors simultaneously targeting MAPKdependent and MAPK-independent signaling were
very efficient at inhibiting aberrant melanoma growth
assessed in multiple cell lines, and xenografted tumors
and biopsies grown in mice. Thus, specific mutational
signatures could guide the design of personalized
therapies based on the use of specific combinations
of drugs that target case-specific pathogenic signaling
mechanisms.

A targeted approach to characterizing the
mutational status of lesions of advanced
melanoma patients

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To better understand the molecular character
of specific melanoma lesions, we set up a targeted
mutational study followed by functional analyses
(described in Supplementary Figure 1). The genomic
design of this study focused on the coding regions of
a specific group of 217 genes that had previously been
shown to be mutated in melanoma and selected mainly
on the basis of their relevance in melanoma and their
association with inhibitors of potential clinical use (see
Materials and Methods for further explanation). To test
this approach our selection of genes was compared in
silico with the whole genome/exome sequencing (WGS/
WES respectively) data already available for 11 advanced
melanoma cell lines and 158 human melanomas (see
Materials and Methods, [13, 14, 18, 19]). This comparison
revealed an average of 3.74 mutated genes that can
participate in multiple targetable signaling pathways,
including PLC, MAPK, RTKs (receptors with tyrosine
kinase activity), PI3K-mTOR and JAK-STAT (Figure 1
and Supplementary Table I). These results prompted us to
study advanced melanoma cases (Breslow index ≥4 mm or
metastasis) in 18 clinically characterized patients (clinical
characteristics summarized in Supplementary Table II)
using a targeted primary ultrasequencing approach,
followed by secondary validation analysis (see Materials
and Methods for further details). By these methods, an
average of 3.4 mutated genes were identified in 11 of the
18 patients, enabled the detection of lesion-specific genes
such as BRAF, RAC1, KRAS, HGF and MAPK7, amongst
others. Interestingly, there was a wide range of mutation
frequencies and combinations, which perhaps reflects the
rich and heterogeneous microclonal composition expected
in melanoma tumors (400X average depth/mutation;
Table I) [20]. Furthermore, actionable mutations such as
BRAFV600E that can guide targeted therapy (using B-RAF
inhibitors) were detected in the same melanoma alongside
other mutated genes that may also guide therapy (Table I).
It is significant that mutations in four patients could not
be validated due to limitations of the tissue sample (see
Materials and Methods), and that no mutations were
identified in three other patients. Thus, this targeted
approach could be adopted to identify genomic alterations
affecting one or several genes. These may be explored as
potential targets for therapy in specific cases of melanoma.

Effects of specific targeted therapy guided by
mutational signature

design targeted therapies based on specific mutational

characterizations, the functional effects of specific
combination therapies were studied in advanced melanoma
cell lines with known mutational profiles (Supplementary
Table III). Taking A375 advanced melanoma cells as an
example, we detected and validated mutations in BRAF,
FGFR2 and mTOR that could reasonably be expected
to associate with Vemurafenib (BRAFi (V), hereafter),
Vargatef (FGFR2i (Va)) and Everolimus (mTORi (E)).
Exponentially growing A375 cells were incubated with
increasing concentrations of each inhibitor. This caused
a concentration-dependent reduction in cell proliferation
from which the IC50 of each inhibitor was calculated
(Figure 2A and Supplementary Table III). These
concentrations were used for subsequent experiments.
Next, the mechanistic effects of treatment with each
inhibitor (using IC50 values in each case) were analyzed
in A375 cells that had been serum-starved to provoke the
inhibition of the intended mutation-associated downstream
signaling. These were assessed by western blot using
P-ERK1/2, P-p38 and P-S6 antibodies (Figure 2B).
To discover more about the biological effects of
multiple combinations of these inhibitors on proliferation,
A375 cells were incubated with IC50 concentrations of
BRAFi, FGFR2i and mTORi in single, double or triple
combinations (blue, green and red lines, respectively,
in Figure 2C). The combinatorial treatments were more
effective at reducing melanoma cell growth than the
monotherapies. The triple combination was the most
efficient, and had no non-specific cytotoxic effects
(Figure  2C and 2E). These results were confirmed
using DNA synthesis as an alternative read-out
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 2D and 2E). Thus, under these conditions,
a combination of inhibitors guided by a specific
mutational signature, simultaneously targeted multiple
signaling mechanisms controlling the growth of A375
cells. Analyzing the mechanistic effects of these drug
combinations on their associated signaling pathways in
this system, showed that treatment with BRAFi inhibited
MAPK signaling. However, treatment of A375 cells with
the inhibitors mTORi and FGFR2i, alone or in combination
(E+Va), had no such effect (Figure 2F and 2G), despite
being very effective at inhibiting cell proliferation
and DNA synthesis (Figures 2C, and 2E). Thus, using
genetically defined inhibitors in this system we can
specifically target a combination of MAPK-dependent (V)
and MAPK-independent (E+Va) signaling mechanisms
that control the malignant growth of A375 melanoma
cells. This observation was not confined to these cells and
more examples of specific mutational signatures guiding
effective combinatorial therapies comprising MAPKdependent and MAPK-independent mechanisms in other
human advanced melanoma cell models are shown in
Supplementary Figures 2, 3 and 5.

Increased effects of targeted therapy against an
appropriate mutational background
As part of a heterogeneous network of aberrant
intracellular signaling, multiple deregulated pathways
can participate in the mechanistic control of melanoma
growth (Figure 1). We examined whether a combination
therapy designed for a specific mutational signature could

A pre-clinical example of targeted therapy
guided by a specific mutational signature
in patient 17

be more effective when used against a genetically
appropriate background. A group of melanoma cell lines
harboring unique mutational signatures (Supplementary
Table III) was treated in parallel with the genetically
defined inhibitors for A375 cells, BRAFi, FGFR2i
and mTORi, alone or in combination. In general, each
treatment was more effective in A375 cells than in the
other melanoma cell lines, with the possible exception
of mTORi used alone (Figure 3A). The triple drug
combination treatment (V+E+Va) simultaneously
targeting MAPK-dependent and MAPK-independent
proliferation mechanisms produced greater inhibition of
A375 cell growth than the others (Figure 3A and 3B).
Likewise, other specific treatments based on the
combination of genetically defined inhibitors in other
melanoma cell lines showed a stronger effect than that
of A375 cells (Supplementary Figure 4A and 4B). More
examples of specific mutational signatures guiding
more effective combination therapies when used against
an appropriate mutational background are shown in
Figure 5E and Supplementary Figure 5C. In summary,
based on specific mutational signatures, a specific
treatment consisting of a combination of genetically
defined inhibitors may have stronger anti-melanoma
activity when used against an appropriate genomic
background.

These findings were challenged by integrating the
study of a freshly resected biopsy from patient 17 (Table I
and Supplementary Table II) in the working pipeline
(illustrated in Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure 1).
First, a fragment of the biopsy was characterized which
enabled the detection of somatic mutations in the BRAF and
MAPK7 (ERK5 hereafter) genes (Table I and Figure 5A),
which were associated with specific inhibitors like
Vemurafenib (BRAFi (V)) and XMD-8–92 (ERK5i (X)).
Second,
freshly
isolated
melanocytes
(MELANOMA17 cells hereafter) were also inspected
for the presence of mutations of BRAF and ERK5
(Figure  5B) and for the expression of well-known
melanoma markers such as S100A and MCSP
(Supplementary Figure 6A and 6B). Once characterized,
MELANOMA17 cells were incubated with increasing
concentrations of BRAFi and ERK5i, and the IC50 of
each was calculated (Supplementary Table III). Treatment
with BRAFi and ERK5i inhibited B-RAF and ERK5dependent signaling, assessed by western blot, in starved
MELANOMA17 cells (Figure 5C). Simultaneous
treatment with both inhibitors was more effective at
reducing MELANOMA17 cell proliferation than either
inhibitor alone (Figure 5D). Furthermore, and consistent
with our previous observations in multiple cell lines, the
combination treatment (BRAFi+ERK5i) was also more
effective in cells with an appropriate mutational signature
(MELANOMA17 cells) when compared with a panel of
other melanoma cell lines (Figure 5E), with the possible
exception of A375 cells, which were highly sensitive to
treatment with the BRAFi dose used (compare the IC50
values for MELANOMA17 with those of A375 cells
in Supplementary Table III). This combination therapy
also consisted of MAPK-dependent (BRAFi) and
MAPK-independent (ERK5i) mechanisms, which
successfully suppressed the aberrant growth of
MELANOMA17 cells (Figure 5F).
Third, another fragment of the biopsy was implanted
in NSG mice and allowed to grow until four tumorcomparable groups of mice could be established. The
groups of mice were then treated with vehicle, BRAFi,
ERK5i, or a combination of the two (V+X). When used
separately, the two inhibitors were able to suppress
xenografted MELANOMA17 tumor growth to a similar
extent, but growth inhibition was more effective when
used in combination (Figure 5G-5I).
Thus, it is possible to study the effects of
personalized therapies, guided by targeted mutational
profiling of advanced melanoma patients, in pre-clinical
ex vivo and in vivo models using freshly resected material
from each lesion.

In vivo effects of a targeted therapy that
combines MAPK-ERK-dependent and MAPKERK-independent mechanisms of inhibition
To study the in vivo effects of targeted therapy
oriented by a specific mutational profile, xenografted
tumors from A375 melanoma cells were generated in
BALB/C mice (nu−/−/nu−/−). Once grown to a volume
of approximately 100 mm3, tumors were assigned
to four comparable groups and treated daily with
vehicle, a MAPK-dependent inhibitor (BRAFi),
a MAPK-independent combination of inhibitors
(FGFR2i+ mTORi), or a triple combination of the latter
(BRAFi+FGFR2i+mTORi). As shown in Figure 4A
and 4B, both treatments used independently reduced
tumor growth to a similar extent. However, the triple
combination (V+Va+E) proved most effective at
reducing melanoma growth in this system. Once the
experiment was finished, the remaining growth potential
of these tumors was characterized by studying Ki67
and the mitotic index in tumor sections. As might be
expected, a marked decrease in both proliferation
markers in those tumors treated with the combination
of MAPK-dependent and MAPK-independent inhibitors
(Figure 4C-4G) was observed, thereby confirming
in vivo our previous findings in cultured cells
(Figures 2D, 2E, and 5).

DISCUSSION

progression or resistance to therapy. In this regard, data
from genetically defined melanoma models now show that
a rational combination of MAPK and PI3K inhibitors can
improve the effects of therapy when used against specific
genomic backgrounds [30]. Moreover, patients with
specific mutations gained greater benefits when treated
with immunotherapy [31, 32]. Thus, better characterization
of advanced melanoma lesions could improve our ability
to treat this disease through the use of specific therapies
that simultaneously target multiple signaling mechanisms.
From a molecular perspective, melanoma is a very
heterogeneous disease in which up to 1, 500 somatic
mutations may be harbored in the coding exons of a single
lesion [13]. This work studies mutations in 217 genes
previously shown to be mutated in melanoma [13, 14, 18,
19, 33, 34] in silico by comparing them with mutations
in 11 cell lines and 158 human melanomas, and ex vivo
by characterizing 18 lesions from advanced melanoma
patients. Under all conditions, genes like BRAF, RAC1,
FGFR2 and IL6R were mutated at varying frequencies,
occurring as part of unique mutational signatures
comprising specific combinations of mutated genes that
have the potential to participate in multiple signaling

Metastatic melanoma provides an instructive
example of the development of rationalized therapies
guided by molecular diagnostics. Mechanistically,
targeted therapy mainly involves the inhibition of the
MAPK signaling pathway by using BRAF or MEK
inhibitors, alone or in combination [21], as suggested by:
A) activating mutations in BRAF and NRAS oncogenes
in 48% and 15% of all diagnosed melanomas, respectively
[22]; and B) multiple MAPK reactivation mechanisms
that confer resistance to BRAF inhibitors [23–25]. This
has improved the clinical management of those patients
with mutated BRAF, whereby targeted inhibition of
aberrant MAPK signaling can increase their OS by up
to 11.4 months, although, from a different perspective, it
still offers a limited benefit to these patients [10, 26, 27].
To explain this, we can hypothesize that, as part of
an intricate network of transforming mechanisms in
melanoma, this disease simultaneously uses multiple
oncogenic mechanisms, such as, for example, PI3K, MET
and GNAQ [28, 29], that, along with MAPK signaling,
act as mechanistic drivers of the disease and promote

pathways and to be associated with specific inhibitors.
Functionally, the effects of combination therapies guided
by specific mutational signatures were analyzed in multiple
melanoma cells harboring unique mutational signatures.
Those treatments that simultaneously targeted MAPKdependent and MAPK-independent signaling were most
effective at reducing melanoma growth both ex vivo and
in vivo. These observations can be aligned with work from
other laboratories, showing that to promote transformation
in melanocytes, aberrant MAPK-signaling elicited
by BRAF or NRAS oncoproteins requires the active
collaboration of other oncogenes, such as PI3K, RALGDS, GNAS or C-MYC, that can participate in alternative
signaling pathways [35–38]. Thus, a combination of
genetically defined inhibitors targeting multiple signaling
pathways could be more effective against specific cases
of malignant melanoma. We might expect targeting
well-known melanoma mechanisms to affect the growth
of melanoma cells in general, and this can indeed be
observed in our data. Nevertheless, combination therapies
guided by specific mutational signatures were most
effective when used against an appropriate mutational
background. Furthermore, different BRAF-mutated cell
lines, each with an individual mutational signature, had
different sensitivities to BRAF inhibition (Supplementary
Table III). Finally, our data strongly suggest that
combining several mutationally selected inhibitors can
specifically block important mechanisms that participate
in the control of aberrant melanoma cell growth and in the
finely tuned cellular decision to activate DNA synthesis
(Figures 2B, 2C, 2E, 4A, 4D and 4E). This rules out
the possibility that the results were a consequence of
nonspecific cytotoxic activities.
Starting with freshly resected material from a
metastatic lesion (patient 17) and trying to match the timing
with the clinic, a validated mutational profile was obtained
within two weeks of resection. This data enabled the study
of a combination therapy based on inhibitors with MAPKdependent (BRAFi) and MAPK-independent (ERK5i)
mechanisms of action in isolated MELANOMA17 cells
and in xenografted tumors grown in mice. These gave the
best results when combinatorial approaches were used.
Of course, this study provides just one example of what
targeted characterization of specific lesions might offer
by way of diagnostic possibilities for human melanoma
in the near future. Considering its potential applicability
in routine clinical practice, this approach would require
several limitations to be overcome. This would entail:
1) establishing efficient protocols to collect, manipulate
and characterize specific lesions that are representative
of the various steps of the disease; 2) managing the
toxicity due to drug combinations; and 3) dealing with
tumor heterogeneity and interactions with the immune
system that may be responsible for the eventual resistance
acquired after combination treatments. However, there
is much scope for studying novel strategies for targeted
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

therapy following a molecular rationale, particularly in
a disease like advanced melanoma that offers a limited
prospect of survival to patients who are suffering from it
(Supplementary Figure 7).
In summary, by adopting targeted approaches we
can envisage working with specific signatures of mutated
genes that can: 1) help characterize individual lesions in
advanced melanoma patients; 2) guide the use of specific
inhibitors rationally combined in individualized therapies
to target case-specific mechanisms of melanocytic
transformation. In this work, a rational combination of
genetically defined inhibitors simultaneously targeting
MAPK-dependent and MAPK-independent signaling
mechanisms showed improved biological outcomes with
respect to the malignant growth of specific advanced
melanomas.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and reagents for tissue culture
Eight human advanced melanoma cell lines were
used. A375 (CRL-1619™ ), SK-MEL-28 (HTB-72™),
SK-MEL-2 (HTB-68™), MALME-3M (HTB-64™),
MEWO (HTB-65™) and HT-144 (HTB-63™) cells were
obtained from the American Type Cell Collection (ATCC,
Rockville, MD). MEL-JUSO (ACC 74) was obtained
from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell
Cultures (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany). Genomic data
from these cells, including those of the somatic mutations
detected in this study, are publicly available at the
Broad-Novartis Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia website
(CCLE:http://www.broadinstitute.org). MELANOMA17
cells were established from a primary biopsy sample, as
explained in the Supplementary Methods. Commercial
cell lines were cultured as recommended by ATCC or
DSMZ and incubated with inhibitors, as described in the
Supplementary Methods.

Cell proliferation and DNA synthesis assays
Cells growing exponentially to approximately
50% confluence in T96 well plates were incubated with
the specific inhibitors while keeping the total amount
of DMSO (0.5%) constant. Cellular proliferation was
evaluated using AlamarBlue reagent (Life Technologies)
and colorimetric changes were quantified using the
Synergy™ HTX Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Biotek).
To assess the effects on DNA synthesis, cells were grown
in a Millicell EZ SLIDE 8-well glass (Merck Millipore,
PEZGS0816) and after treatment with specific inhibitors
were incubated for a further 2 h with Click-iT® EdU
(Alexa Fluor® 594 Imaging Kit; Life Technologies,
C10339). Immediately afterwards, cells were prepared for
microscopy following the manufacturer’s specifications
(see Supplementary Methods for further explanation).

Technologies), using High Sensitivity DNA reagents and
chip Kits (Agilent Technologies). Libraries were sequenced
at the Instituto de Medicina Genómica (IMEGEN, Valencia
University, Spain) with a MiSeq Personal Sequencer
(Illumina). The process of somatic mutation identification
described in the Supplementary Methods.

Genomic DNA samples
Matched tumoral and non-tumoral material was
obtained from 18 patients diagnosed with advanced
melanoma and who were being monitored by the Oncology
Department of the Hospital Universitario Marqués de
Valdecilla (HUMV; see clinical characteristics in Table I).
Tumoral DNA samples were obtained from freshly
frozen tissue samples taken at the time of diagnosis, and
matched non-tumoral DNA was extracted from saliva or
peripheral blood neutrophils. We designed an intra-subject
observational study of patients diagnosed with advanced
melanoma and with a Breslow index of ≥4 mm, and with
a loco-regional infiltration in lymph nodes or presenting
distant metastasis. The study, the patient information
sheet, and the informed consent form were approved by
the Ethics Committee of the HUMV.

Somatic mutation identification
Sequencing data were aligned against the human
reference genome (hg19) using the BWA aligner [39]. The
alignment was refined using SAMTOOLS fixmate (PMID:
19505943) and PICARD TOOLS cleanSam tools (http://
broadinstitute.github.io/picard.). Local realignment of
insertions and deletions (indels) was then performed using
the GATK suite [40] before final sorting and indexing.
The RAMSES application (PMID: 24296945), written
in-house, was used to detect nucleotide substitutions.
Small indels were identified using Pindel [41] in paired
tumor-normal mode. For greater specificity, only simple
insertion and deletion events of fewer than 10 bp were
selected. An in-house perl script filter was used to extract
high-quality indels: considering the high sequence
coverage obtained in these samples, only those indels with
a minimum coverage of 20 reads in both tumor and normal
samples, and with a minimum frequency of 10% of the
reads and a minimum of five independent reads supporting
the event in the tumor sample, and with no evidence in
the normal sample, were considered. All potential somatic
mutations were filtered using the dbSNP132 and 1000
Genomes Project mutation databases and the functional
consequence at the protein level was annotated according
to the Ensembl database using an in-house perl script
based on the Ensembl database API.

Enrichment library design, preparation,
sequencing and variant calling
Genomic DNA samples were processed using the
Qubit® dsDNA BR Assay Kit (Life Technologies) and
quantified using Qubit 2.0 apparatus (Life Technologies).
The DNA enrichment library was prepared using a
specifically designed HaloPlex Target Enrichment
System Kit for this melanoma study (Design ID: 009121339502780, Agilent Technologies) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The design focused on the
coding regions of a group 217 genes known to be mutated
in melanoma, and which were selected because they were:
A) genes of known relevance in melanoma, including
BRAF, NRAS [7], and EGFR [18, 19]; B) genes that
may be associated with pharmacological inhibitors of
potential clinical use, such as FGFR2, KIT and ERBB4
[18, 20, 21]; and C) genes that may be involved in
chromatin architecture (ARID1A and DNMT3A [14]),
intracellular signaling (MEK1 [22]), or transcription
(NFATC2 [22]). Briefly, 400 ng of genomic DNA was
digested with the specific cocktail of restriction enzymes
provided in the kit. Digested DNA was then hybridized
to a probe for target enrichment, indexed and captured.
Each DNA was then amplified by PCR at Tm = 60°C, for
18 cycles, using a Herculase II Fusion Enzyme kit (Agilent
Technologies). Next, amplified target libraries were
purified using an Agencourt AMPure XP Kit (Beckman
Coulter Genomics), following the manufacturer’s
guidelines, and quantified with Qubit 2.0 apparatus (Life
Technologies), using the Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kit
(Life Technologies). They were also analyzed in parallel
by capillary electrophoresis in a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Validation analysis
Genomic DNA was amplified using the specific
oligonucleotides described in Supplementary Table IV.
All amplicons from the same patient were mixed in a
tube and each sample was quantified by Qubit 2.0 (Life
Technologies), using the Qubit® dsDNA BR Assay
Kit (Life Technologies). MELANOMA17 cells were
monitored by Sanger sequencing for the presence of
mutations in BRAF and MAPK7 (see the supplementary
methods for further details).

Unless otherwise specified, all experiments were
done in independent triplicates and all numerical data were
summarized as the average of the values ± the standard
error of the mean (SEM) using GraphPad PRISM.
Levels of statistical significance are indicated as follows:

Mice and reagents for in vivo studies
BALB/c Nude mice CAnN.Cg-Foxn1nu/Crl
(Charles River) were injected with 6 × 106 A375 melanoma
cells in the subcutaneous dorsal area. Approximately one
week later, the tumor reached a volume of about 100 mm3,
at which point mice were assigned to four tumor sizecomparable groups of 12 animals and treated as described
in the Supplementary Methods.
Fresh tissue from patient 17, who had been
