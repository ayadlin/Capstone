ABSTRACT
The Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor ibrutinib has demonstrated promising
efficacy in a variety of hematologic malignancies. However, the precise mechanism
of action of the drug remains to be fully elucidated. Tumor-infiltrating macrophages
presented in the tumor microenvironment have been shown to promote development
and progression of B-cell lymphomas through crosstalk mediated by secreted cytokines
and chemokines. Because Btk has been implicated in Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling
pathways that regulate macrophage activation and production of proinflammatory
cytokines, we investigated the immunomodulatory effects of Btk inhibitor on
macrophages. Our results demonstrate that Btk inhibition efficiently suppresses
production of CXCL12, CXCL13, CCL19, and VEGF by macrophages. Furthermore,
attenuated secretion of homeostatic chemokines from Btk inhibitor-treated macrophages
significantly compromise adhesion, invasion, and migration of lymphoid malignant cells
and even those not driven by Btk expression. The supernatants from Btk inhibitor-treated
macrophages also impair the ability of endothelial cells to undergo angiogenic tube
formation. Mechanistic analysis revealed that Btk inhibitors treatment downregulates
secretion of homeostatic chemokines and cytokines through inactivation of Btk signaling
and the downstream transcription factors, NF-κB, STAT3, and AP-1. Taken together,
these results suggest that the encouraging therapeutic efficacy of Btk inhibitor may
be due to both direct cytotoxic effects on malignant B cells and immunomodulatory
effects on macrophages present in the tumor microenvironment. This novel mechanism
of action suggests that, in addition to B-cell lymphomas, Btk inhibitor may also have
therapeutic value in lymphatic malignancies and solid tumors lacking Btk expression.

characteristics, clinical features, and prognoses [1].
Gene profiling analysis has revealed that, in addition to
neoplastic B cells, non-neoplastic immune cells present

in the tumor microenvironment (TME) play an essential
role in the biology of lymphoma and can serve as
powerful predictors of disease outcomes [2]. The TME
is comprised of many cell types, including macrophages,
lymphocytes, stromal cells, fibroblasts, and the cells that
make up the intratumoral vasculature. These cells promote
development and progression of B-cell lymphomas
through secretion of cytokines and chemokines that
mediate crosstalk between malignant cells and immune
cells [3]. For example, tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs) have been shown to secrete the homeostatic
chemokines, CXCL12 and CXCL13, which bind to their
respective G protein-coupled receptors on malignant B
cells, CXCR4 and CXCR5. These interactions promote
prosurvival signaling and protect malignant B cells from
the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapies [4, 5]. In addition,
Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-3 beta (MIP-3β), also
called CCL19 is essential for the migration and spreading
of mantle cell lymphoma [6]. Thus, TAMs presented in the
TME represent a potential therapeutic target for treatment
of B-cell lymphoma.
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a member of the
Tec family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, which are
predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells [7]. In
addition to its essential regulatory role in B-cell proliferation
and survival, Btk has also been implicated in promotion
of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling [8], which regulates
macrophage activation and production of proinflammatory
cytokines. Several studies have demonstrated crosstalk
between Btk and TLR signaling pathways to mediate
transactivation of downstream cascades [9, 10].
Furthermore, macrophages from X-linked immunodeficient
(xid) mice lacking Btk function exhibit impaired nitric
oxide, TNF-α, and IL-1β production, suggesting that Btk
plays a critical role in regulation of immunity [11, 12].
Ibrutinib, the first irreversible, small-molecule
Btk inhibitor, has demonstrated promising therapeutic
effects in patients with B-cell lymphoma [13, 14]. The
encouraging clinical efficacy of ibrutinib has been
reported to result not only from direct cytotoxic effects on
malignant B cells, but also from anti-cancer mechanisms
that diminish the contributions of the surrounding
microenvironment to cancer cell growth and survival
[15–17]. A majority of chronic lymphocytic leukemia
and mantle cell lymphoma patients treated with ibrutinib
display a transient increase in circulating lymphocytes
and reduced lymphadenopathy. These observations are
indicative of downregulation of BCR signaling in tumor
cells, which leads to mobilization of malignant B cells
from the tumor tissue to the peripheral bloodstream.
Recently new generations of irreversible Btk inhibitors
have exhibited different selectivity profile and more potent
anti-tumor activity [18, 19]. Our developed inhibitor PLS123 presents the dual-action inhibitory mode targeting
both Btk catalytic activity and its own auto-activation [20,
21]. However, the precise mechanisms underlying effects
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of Btk inhibition on macrophages present in the TME are
not well understood.
In this study, we report that the Btk inhibitors
ibrutinib and PLS-123 exerted immunomodulatory effects
through regulation of tumor-infiltrating macrophages and
suppressed production of homeostatic chemokines and
angiogenic cytokines. Thus, the promising therapeutic
effects of Btk inhibition can be attributed to both direct
inhibition of BCR signaling in lymphoma cells and
immunomodulation of macrophages present in the TME.

RESULTS
Btk inhibition suppresses production of
homeostatic chemokines and angiogenic
cytokines by macrophages
To characterize the immunomodulatory effects of
Btk inhibitors, THP-1 differentiated macrophages were
pretreated with the Btk inhibitors ibrutinib and PLS-123 for
1 hour. After Btk inhibitor washout, the supernatants from
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cells were analyzed by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Importantly,
the Btk inhibitors ibrutinib and PLS-123 did not induce
cytotoxic effects towards macrophages (Supplementary
Figure 1). As shown in Figure 1A, Btk inhibition efficiently
downregulated secretion of homeostatic chemokines
(CXCL12, CXCL13, and CCL19), as well as the angiogenic
cytokine, VEGF, in THP-1 differentiated macrophages. The
similar results were also observed in human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs; Figure 1B). To further determine
whether downregulation occurred at the transcriptional level,
total RNA was extracted from Btk inhibitor-treated THP1 differentiated macrophages, and mRNA expression was
analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
Btk inhibition strongly reduced expression of the CXCL12,
CXCL13, CCL19, and VEGF mRNAs, suggesting that Btk
activation was required for transcription of these chemokines
and this cytokine (Figure 1C).

Depletion of Btk inhibits macrophage production
of homeostatic chemokines and angiogenic
cytokines
To further explore the role of Btk in macrophage
signaling, the effects of Btk knockdown on chemokine
and cytokine production was analyzed. Efficacy of
siRNA-mediated knockdown of Btk was analyzed by
Western blotting (Figure 2A). Macrophages transfected
with Btk-specific siRNAs were stimulated with LPS for
18 hours [21], and levels of chemokines and cytokine
in the supernatant were measured by ELISA. Btk
knockdown significantly inhibited secretion of CXCL12,
CXCL13, CCL19, and VEGF by macrophages (Figure
2B). Similarly, PCR analysis of siRNA-transfected

of chemokine-mediated Btk activation within tumor cells
[17]. To investigate whether immunomodulatory effects
of Btk inhibition on macrophages present in the TME
affect tumor cell function, malignant B-cell lymphoma
Namalwa and OCI-Ly7 cells were co-cultured with
supernatants collected from control and Btk inhibitorstreated macrophages. Consistent with results showing
that Btk inhibition decreases chemokines and cytokine
production (Figure 1), adhesion of malignant B cells to
fibronectin was attenuated by supernatant exposure in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A).
To further assess the impact of Btk inhibition of
macrophages on tumor cell function, supernatant-treated
Namalwa and OCI-Ly7 cells were subjected to an in
vitro motility assay using a transwell culture system. Btk

Tumor-infiltrated macrophages have been shown
to promote progression of B-cell lymphomas through
intercellular crosstalk mediated by cytokines and
chemokines [3]. In addition, ibrutinib treatment has
been demonstrated to efficiently inhibit adhesion and
migration of malignant B cells through downregulation

Btk inhibition of macrophages affects endothelial
cell tube formation

inhibitor-mediated decreases in chemokine and cytokine
levels in macrophage supernatants were associated with
concomitant decreases in the ability of malignant B cells
treated with these supernatants to undergo invasion and
migration. Even more importantly, the supernatants
collected from Btk inhibitors-treated macrophages also
strongly diminished the motility of T-cell lymphoma
Hut78 cells, suggesting immunomodulatory effects of
Btk inhibition on macrophages presented in the tumor
microenvironment may also have therapeutic value in
lymphatic malignancies not driven by Btk expression
(Figure 3B and 3C; Supplementary Figure 2). Thus,
in addition to their direct effects on tumor cells, Btk
inhibitors likely also indirectly blocked the motility of
neoplastic cells through downregulation of chemokine
and cytokine production by macrophages.

New growth of the vascular network plays an
important role in progression of lymphoma and is
dependent upon communication between various cell
types present in the TME [22]. Thus, we hypothesized
that treatment of macrophages with Btk inhibitors
would compromise VEGF production and angiogenesis
in the TME. A Matrigel assay revealed that treatment
of endothelial cells with supernatants from control
macrophages induced endothelial cell tube formation,
while treatment with supernatants from Btk inhibitortreated macrophages reduced tube formation in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 4). Thus, these results
suggested that Btk may exert affects on angiogenesis
through modulation of cytokine production by TAMs.

phosphorylation and the negative pathway feedback loop,
resulting in amplified Tyr551 phosphorylation [24]. The
dual-action Btk inhibitor PLS-123 not only significantly
suppressed Btk Tyr223 phosphorylation but also reduced
elevated Btk Tyr551 phosphorylation. Furthermore,
Western blot analysis also demonstrated that Btk inhibition
efficiently reduced downstream activation of PLCγ2
and MAPK family proteins (p38, ERK1/2 and JNK)
[25], consistent with results showing that Btk inhibition
downregulates chemokine and cytokine production.
Interestingly, the phosphorylation of JNK was slightly
upregulated by PLS-123 treatment (Figure 5).

To investigate the mechanisms by which Btk
inhibition blocks production of homeostatic chemokines
and an angiogenic cytokine by macrophages, THP-1
differentiated macrophages were incubated with Btk
inhibitors in the presence or absence of LPS stimulation.
LPS stimulation is thought to mimic TLR/antigen
interactions, thereby activating downstream signaling
pathways [23]. Results from this analysis revealed
that ibrutinib inhibited the LPS-induced Btk Tyr223

of immunomodulatory effect towards macrophages.
Together, these results suggested that Btk inhibition
exerts anti-tumor immunomodulatory effects through
the regulation of NF-κB, STAT3, and AP-1 activation in
macrophages.

Because transcription factors are key regulators of
chemokine and cytokine production, we next analyzed the
effects of Btk inhibition on activation of NF-κB, STAT3,
and AP-1 using a luciferase reporter assay in macrophages.
Treatment with LPS resulted in significant increase in
reporter activities associated with all three transcription
factors. Reporter activity of NF-κB and AP-1 was strongly
reduced by incubation with ibrutinib. The dual-action
Btk inhibitor PLS-123 decreased the NF-κB and STAT3
activation. Similar to results from the reporter assay, the
activation of transcription factor was also confirmed by
Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from
control and Btk inhibitor-treated macrophages (Figure
6). Consistent with previous immunoblotting result of
JNK phosphorylation, the nuclear transcription factors
AP-1 activation was slightly increased by PLS-123
treatment, which suggested its alternative mechanism

DISCUSSION
Ibrutinib, the first selective, irreversible, smallmolecule inhibitor of Btk, covalently binds with cysteine
481 (Cys-481) near the active site of the kinase to block its
enzymatic activity [26]. Ibrutinib has clearly demonstrated
promising therapeutic effects in clinical trials and has
been approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)
for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle
cell lymphoma, and Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia.
Importantly, the encouraging clinical efficacy of
ibrutinib results from both direct cytotoxic effects on
cancer cells, including activation of apoptosis, inhibition
of DNA replication, and blockade of prosurvival
signaling pathways, as well as from inhibition of

interactions between tumor cells and the surrounding
microenvironment that affect cellular adhesion and
migration [27]. Recently, the immunomodulatory effect
of ibrutinib has been reported to enhance the anti-tumor
immune response of infiltrating T cells and reduce
chronic graft-versus-host disease [28, 29]. Thus, these
observations suggest that the effects of Btk inhibition on
the TME require more detailed investigation.
Many lines of evidence indicate that the frequency
and distribution of non-neoplastic immune cells in
the TME is strongly associated with the outcome and
prognosis of lymphoma [30]. TAMs promote tumor
progression through secretion of homeostatic chemokines,
pro-angiogenic factors, and suppressive cytokines, which
limit the anticancer immune response [31]. Because Btk
is expressed in macrophages and its phosphorylation is
upregulated upon macrophage activation, we hypothesized
that the promising anti-tumor activity of ibrutinib might
be partially attributed to immunomodulatory effects on
TAMs present in the TME. Understanding the complete
mechanism of action of ibrutinib will help us to better
explain the clinical findings associated with the drug, as
well as identify potential new therapeutic uses.
Chang et al. previously demonstrated that B-cell
lymphoma patients treated with ibrutinib display reduced
lymphadenopathy, accompanied by transient increases in
circulating malignant B cells in the peripheral bloodstream
[17]. The underlying mechanism for this transient increase
has been attributed to ibrutinib-mediated inhibition of
chemokine-mediated adhesion and migration resulting
from decreased stimulation of phosphorylated Btk
(p-Btk) and phosphorylated PLC-γ2 (p-PLCγ2) by
CXC12/CXCL13 in malignant B cells. However, results
from our present study reveal that Btk inhibitors also
exert immunomodulatory effects on macrophages that
lead to decreased chemokines and cytokine production.
Furthermore, supernatants collected from Btk inhibitorstreated macrophages efficiently compromise the adhesion,
invasion and migration function in lymphoid malignancies
and even those not driven by Btk expression. Thus,
attenuated CXCL12, CXCL13, and CCL19 levels in the
TME may limit the interactions between malignant cells
and surrounding non-neoplastic immune cells, thereby
contributing to mobilization of lymphoid malignant
cells from tumor tissues to the peripheral bloodstream
through a cancer cell-independent mechanism. This novel
mechanism of action suggests that, in addition to B-cell
lymphomas, Btk inhibitors may also displayed impressive
therapeutic potency in lymphatic malignancies and solid
tumors lacking Btk expression.
Tec family kinases, such as Btk, have been shown to
activate downstream signaling pathways and transcription
factors [32, 33]. Activation of the transcription factors
NF-κB p65, STAT3, and AP-1 induces expression of
genes responsible for inflammation, including CXCL12,
CXCL13, CCL19, and VEGF, which play important
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

roles in the TME [34–37]. Therefore, we investigated
the transcriptional mechanisms underlying Btk
inhibitor-mediated decreases in chemokine and cytokine
production. Data from pharmacological studies and
Western blot assays demonstrated that Btk inhibition
reduced chemokine production through downregulation
of Btk phosphorylation and activation of downstream
transcription factors (Figures 5 and 6). These findings
suggest that targeting Btk activation in TAMs could be an
efficient therapeutic strategy that exerts anti-cancer effects
through impacts on the TME.
Increasing evidences indicate that targeting
TAMs present in the TME significantly reduces tumor
progression and improves the efficacy of chemotherapy
[38]. For example, the chemotherapeutic agent trabectedin
exhibited remarkable anti-tumor activity resulting from
cytotoxicity towards mononuclear phagocytes [39]. CSF1R inhibitors represent a promising therapeutic approach
for targeting TAMs. CSF-1/CSF-1R signaling has been
shown to play essential roles in regulating differentiation
and survival of macrophages and driving macrophage
recruitment into tumor tissues [40, 41]. Results from
a phase I clinical trial demonstrated that the CSF-1Rtargeted monoclonal antibody RG7155 depleted CSF-1R+
CD163+ macrophages in tumor tissues and had significant
clinical benefit in patients with diffuse-type giant cell
tumors. Thus, chemo-immunomodulatory strategies
targeting macrophages can successfully limit tumor
progression and metastasis.
In conclusion, our results suggest that Btk inhibition
modulates immune responses in the TME. These previously
unrecognized immunomodulatory mechanisms associated
with Btk inhibitors indicate that evaluation of this drug in
other lymphatic malignancies and solid tumors, even those
lacking Btk expression, may be warranted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell adhesion and motility assay

The Btk inhibitors ibrutinib and PLS-123 were
synthesized at the laboratory of Dr. Zhengying Pan at
Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School according to a
previously published procedure [21, 26]. Antibodies against
phospho-Tyr223-Btk (#5082), Btk (#8547), phosphoTyr1217-PLCγ2 (#3871), PLCγ2 (#3872), phospho-p38
(#9211), p38 (#8690), phospho-ERK1/2 (#4370),
ERK1/2(#9102), phosho-JNK (#9251) and JNK (#9252)
were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA, USA). The anti-p65 (phospho S536), STAT3 (phospho
Y705), AP-1 (phospho S63) and PCNA were purchased
from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). The anti-phospho-Tyr551Btk, β-actin (A5441) and Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were
obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA) and Sigma.

Lymphoid malignant cells were treated with the
conditioned medium derived from macrophages for
3 hours, and then cells were seeded into 96-well plates
that were precoated with fibronectin (BD Biosciences).
Thirty minutes later cells were washed twice with PBS
to remove the non-adherent cells, and adherent cells were
measured by CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay
kit. For relative adhesion determination, the group treated
with LPS alone was set to be 1 and the other group was
normalized to this group.
For cell invasion and migration assay, tumor cells
suspended in serum free medium were pre-labeled with
calcein-AM (Sigma) for 30 minutes, then cells were
plated into FluoroBlok™ inserts (Corning), which were
precoated with Fibronectin or not. The inserts were placed
in a 24-well plate containing conditioned medium from
macrophages. Twelve hours later, tumor cells in the
lower chambers were measured by plate reader at bottom
reading mode and visualized by an inverted fluorescence
microscope (TCS-SP2, Leica Microsystems).

ELISA
THP-1 differentiated macrophages were treated
with the indicated Btk inhibitors in the presence or
absence of LPS stimulation, and supernatants were
collected for the analysis of CXCL12, CXCL13, CCL19
and VEGF production by using ELISA kits (PeproTech,
London, UK).

Tube formation assay
Growth factor-reduced Matrigel were distributed
in 24-well plates and allowed to solidify at 37°C for at
least 1 hour. HUVECs incubated in M199 containing 1%
FBS for 6 hours were harvested after trypsin treatment and
suspended in macrophage-derived conditioned medium.
HUVECs were then seeded onto the solified Matrigel.
After 20 hours, the cultures were observed and digital
pictures were captured with phase contrast microscopy
(Axio Observer A1, Zeiss). For relative tube formating
determination, the group treated with LPS alone was set
to be 1 and the other group was normalized to this group.

Real-time quantitative PCR
THP-1 differentiated macrophages were treated
with Btk inhibitors in the presence or absence of LPS
for 12 hours, and total RNA was extracted via RNA
TRIzol Extraction (Life Technologies). The mRNA
levels of CXCL12, CXCL13, CCL19, and VEGF were
determined by SYBR real-time quantitative PCR kit.

To prepare whole cell extracts, PMA-differentiated
macrophages were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer [21].
Equivalent amounts of protein (10 μg) were resolved
on SDS-PAGE gels, transferred and immobilized on
