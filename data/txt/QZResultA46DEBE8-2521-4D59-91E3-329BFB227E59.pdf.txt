ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive solid malignancies prone
to metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to cancer
invasiveness and drug resistance. In this study, we investigated whether HS-173,
a novel PI3K inhibitor blocked the process of EMT in pancreatic cancer. HS-173
inhibited the growth of pancreatic cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner.
Moreover, it significantly suppressed the TGF-β-induced migration and invasion, as
well as reversed TGF-β-induced mesenchymal cell morphology. Also, HS-173 reduced
EMT by increasing epithelial markers and decreasing the mesenchymal markers
by blocking the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Smad2/3 signaling pathways in pancreatic
cancer cells. In addition, HS-173 clearly suppressed tumor growth without drug
toxicity in both xenograft and orthotopic mouse models. Furthermore, to explore
the anti-metastatic effect of HS-173, we established pancreatic cancer metastatic
mouse models and found that it significantly inhibited metastatic dissemination of
the primary tumor to liver and lung. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that
HS-173 can efficiently suppress EMT and metastasis by inhibiting PI3K/AKT/mTOR
and Smad2/3 signaling pathways, suggesting it can be a potential candidate for the
treatment of advanced stage pancreatic cancer.

of cancer-related death [3]. The role of chemotherapy
in metastatic pancreatic cancer is to relieve symptoms
and to improve survival [4]. Nevertheless, the lack of
effective chemotherapies and drug resistance contributes
to the high mortality of patients diagnosed with metastatic
pancreatic cancer [5, 6]. Therefore, the development of
more effective treatments and approaches for pancreatic
cancer with metastasis is urgently needed.
The molecular mechanism involved in metastasis
has been shown to dysregulate the signaling pathways
that control epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
The process of EMT has been proposed to allow immotile
epithelial cells with cellular polarity to dissociate from
each other and undergo a morphological transformation

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive
solid malignancies with an extremely poor prognosis of an
overall 5-year survival rate of <5% [1]. Without a specific
diagnostic marker and symptom in early stage, pancreatic
cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced/late stage and
only palliative measures can be offered [2]. Because of
the late onset of symptoms, only 10%–15% of patients are
presented with resectable disease, whereas the remaining
are present with either locally advanced unresectable
or metastatic disease. Namely, more than 80% of
pancreatic cancer patients are present with locoregional
spread and/or distant metastasis, being the main cause

into cells with a fibroblast-like mesenchymal shape in
order to engage in program of the cell motility, affecting
cell migration [7]. EMT endows cells with migratory and
invasive properties, inducing resistance to conventional
chemotherapy [8, 9]. Especially, in pancreatic cancer, the
expression of EMT markers such as Ncadherin, Vimentin,
and transcription factors including ZEB1, Snail, and Twist
have been increased in surgically resected pancreatic
cancer sepecimens but not in the normal noncancerous
pancreatic tissue [9-11]. Moreover, the presence of EMT
in pancreatic cancer has been reported to be frequently
associated with undifferentiated phenotype and overall
poor survival compared with tumors without EMT [11,
12]. As mentioned above, EMT induces drug resistance
in cancer cells, which gives rise to the acceleration of
metastasis [6]. Thus, suppression of EMT is very crucial
to improve drug response and to block metastasis in cancer
therapies.
Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a
potent inducer of EMT and positive regulator of tumor
progression and metastasis [13, 14]. TGF-β has been
shown to activate various downstream pathways
including phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), Smads,
and MAPK, which are involved in TGF-β-induced EMT
[15-18]. In particular, activation of PI3K/AKT pathway
has emerged as a central signaling pathway in regulating
EMT [19].
PI3K signaling plays an important role in cell cycle,
survival, metabolism, and motility [20]. Aberrations
of the PI3K signaling induces the pathogenesis of
numerous cancers by altering cell growth and apoptosis
[1]. Vichalkovski et al. have reported that activation of
AKT upregulated the expression of Twist, subsequently
decreasing chemotherapy-induced DNA damage, and
inhibiting apoptosis [21]. Moreover, phosphorylated
AKT is positively correlated with the high level of Twist
as well as low expression of Ecadherin in oral squamous
cell carcinoma [22]. In addition, the treatment of AKT
inhibitor decreased the expression of Snail and Twist [23,
24] and eventually promoting the expression of Ecadherin,
reducing the expression of Vimentin; restored the
polygonal shape of cells, and stimulated the mesenchymalepithelial transition (MET).
Given that the PI3K/AKT signaling activates the
process of EMT and tumor metastasis, we hypothesized
that targeting the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway may
suppress EMT. Therefore, we explored whether HS-173
[25-27], a novel PI3K inhibitor might inhibit TGF-βinduced EMT and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Our
study revealed that HS-173 could efficiently suppress
TGF-β-induced migration, invasion, and metastasis
by inhibiting EMT process through the regulation of
PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Smad2/3 signaling pathways,
suggesting that HS-173 is a potential candidate for
advanced stage treatment of pancreatic cancer with
metastasis.

HS-173 inhibits cancer cell growth and colony
formation in pancreatic cancer cells
In order to evaluate the effect of HS-173 on the
cell growth of pancreatic cancer, three cell lines (Panc1, Miapaca-2 and Aspc-1) were used. When pancreatic
cancer cells were treated with various concentrations (0.110 μM) of HS-173, it reduced the cell viability in a doseand time-dependent manner (Figure 1A). In particular,
1 μM of HS-173 inhibited the cell growth by 40-50% in
Miapaca-2 and Aspc-1 cells at 48 h. To further determine
the sensitivity of HS-173, we performed clonogenic assay
in Miapaca-2 cells for 14 days. In agreement with the MTT
assay, HS-173 showed a significant drug response by the
inhibition of colony formation in pancreatic cancer cells
dose-dependently. Additionally, we observed that colony
formation by HS-173 was less than 50% in Miapaca-2
cells at dose of 1 μM (Figure 1B).

HS-173 inhibits TGF-β-induced cell migration
and invasion in pancreatic cancer cells
As enhanced migration has been shown to occur
during EMT [28], we performed wound healing assay
to identify the effect of HS-173 on the migration of
pancreatic cancer cells. For the significant induction
of EMT in vitro, we used TGF-β (10 ng/mL). In three
pancreatic cancer cell lines, TGF-β treated group was
healed over 90% of the wound area within 16 h, whereas
cells in control group were slowly migrated. However,
HS-173 successfully suppressed TGF-β-induced cell
migration dose-dependently in all pancreatic cancer cell
lines (Figure 2). Next, as invasive ability is one of the
major hallmarks of cancer cell, we identified the effect of
HS-173 on the invasion of pancreatic cancer cells using
transwell invasion assays. As shown in Figure 3, TGF-β
induced the invasive capacity of cancer cells, which was
inhibited by HS-173 co-treatment. Collectively, these
results indicate that HS-173 effectively prevents TGF-βinduced cell miagration and invasion.

HS-173 suppresses TGF-β-induced epithelial
mesenchymal transition (EMT)
TGF-β is a positive regulator of EMT in cancer, as
indicated by a morphological change to spindle-shaped
appearances, decreased expression of epithelial markers
and increased expression of mesenchymal markers.
Therefore, we investigated whether HS-173 could change
EMT related morphology after EMT induction by TGF-β
in pancreatic cancer cells. As shown in Figure 4A, the cells
treated with TGF-β lost their typical epithelial morphology
and their ability to grow in clusters and acquired
a  mesenchymal phenotype with a flat and  spindle-like

morphology. However, the cells treated with HS-173 were
more cuboidal and tightly adherent in TGF-β-induced
pancreatic cancer cells.
In epithelial cancer cells, the decreased Ecadherin
and the increased Vimentin expression are known as
the main EMT characteristics, which is responsible
for the progression of EMT such as cell migration and
metastasis [29]. To explore whether HS-173 affected the

expressions of Ecadherin and Vimentin, we measured the
expression using Western blotting. As a result, we found
that HS-173 recovered the MET process as follows: the
expression of Ecadherin was increased, whereas that
of Vimentin was strongly decreased in TGF-β-induced
pancreatic cancer cells. As mentioned above, ZEB1,
Snail, and Twist repressed Ecadherin, and their enhanced
expression is regarded as key events in the EMT process

[30]. In our study, ZEB1 was highly activated by TGF-β,
which was significantly inhibited by HS-173 (Figure 4B).
This result was also confirmed by immunofluorescence
data (Figure 4D). However, the expression of Snail
showed a slight inhibition after HS-173 treatment in
TGF-β-induced pancreatic cancer cells (Figure 4B).
As shown in Figure 4C, HS-173 obviously inhibited the
expression of Vimentin, showing spider web-like stress

fibers, which is a typical characteristic of mesenchymal
cells. The fact that HS-173 significantly inhibited EMT
process raised the question how the effect may have been
mediated. As a PI3K inhibitor, HS-173 can be predicted
to interrupt the PI3K/AKT axis, and consequently block
the activation of downstream effectors such as AKT and
mTOR. Therefore, to investigate whether the anti-EMT
effect of HS-173 was mediated by the inhibition of PI3K/

AKT and TGF/Smads signaling pathways, we explored
the phosphorylation status of PI3K/AKT and TGF/
Smads signaling pathways, respectively. As expected,
the treatment of HS-173 effectively inhibited p-AKT and
p-mTOR, and subsequently decreased the p-Smad2 and
p-Smad3, implying that HS-173 had anti-EMT effect by
regulation of both PI3k/AKT and TGF/Smads signaling
(Figure 4E).

with p-AKT and p-Smad2. In agreement with our previous
in vitro result, Ecadherin was increased, whereas Vimentin
and ZEB1 were downregulated in the HS-173 treated
group (Figure 6D and 6E). Furthermore, HS-173 treatment
decreased p-AKT and p-Smad2 in tumor tissues. Taken
together, our results demonstrate that HS-173 has potent
anti-tumor efficacy by inhibiting EMT via regulation of
PI3K/AKT and TGF/Smads pathways.

HS-173 prevents TGF-β-induced epithelial
mesenchymal transition (EMT) in 3D spheroids

HS-173 reduces metastasis in cancer metastatic
mouse models

As conventional two-dimensional (2D) culture
models lacks realistic complexity to reflect human tumor
biology, we investigated the effect of HS-173 on three
dimensional (3D) culture. In sphere formation assay, Panc1 cells were treated with either TGF-β alone or along with
different doses of HS-173 (Figure 5A). Our study showed
that the spheres of TGF-β treated group became more
compact than that of control group, whereas HS-173 along
with TGF-β reduced the sphere size dose-dependently. To
further confirm these results, we evaluated the expression
of Ecadherin and Vimentin in 3D spheroids cultures using
modified hanging drop method. After the exposure to 10
ng/mL of TGF-β, the expression of Vimentin was rapidly
induced and HS-173 reversed this up-regulation, whereas
Ecadherin was also highly expressed in HS-173-treated
group (Figure 5B).

Based on the in vivo findings, we extended our study
to metastasis models, establishing a long term cancer
metastatic models with Balb/c nude mice transplanting
Miapaca-2 cells into the spleen. After 30 days of
inoculation, HS-173 was treated at doses of 10 mg/kg and
30 mg/kg (n=7, per group) for 25 days. The liver, lung,
and lymph node along with primary tumors were excised
and the metastatic lesions were determined by H&E
staining (Figure 7). Our results showed that the metastatic
burdens on the lung and liver were significantly decreased
by HS-173 treatment (10 and 30 mg/kg). As previous
studies have shown that CK19 expression is correlated
with lymph node metastasis in various solid malignancies
[31-33], we identified its expression in the lymph node. As
shown in Figure 7E, the CK19 expression was decreased
by HS-173 treatment.

HS-173 inhibits primary tumor growth and
EMT in vivo

DISCUSSION
The issues of tumor recurrence, drug resistance,
enhanced invasion and metastasis remain a challenge in the
treatment and clinical management of pancreatic cancer.
Despite the efforts to better understand the metastasatic
progression of pancreatic cancer, more effective treatments
have been limited due to the difficulty in the identification
of functionally relevant targets of the disease. EMT is
thought to generate metastasis and contribute to therapy
resistance. Therefore, the EMT pathway is of great
therapeutic interest in the treatment of cancer and could
be targeted to prevent tumor dissemination in patients
with high risk of developing metastatic lesions. Recent
studies have suggested that some novel cancer drugs may
be capable of controlling the spread of carcinoma via EMT
inhibition [34, 35]. Recently, PI3K has gained widespread
attention as a potential target for preventing and treating
metastatic tumors associated with EMT. Nevertheless,
no PI3K/AKT inhibitors have been approved for treating
pancreatic cancer patients with metastasis. Accordingly,
we sought to analyze the effects of HS-173, a PI3K
inhibitor on the EMT in pancreatic cancer and to identify
its possible mechanism of action. Herein, we found that
HS-173 inhibited TGF-β-induced migration and invasion,
as well as EMT-related proteins by the suppression of
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in parallel with the

To further determine whether HS-173 is involved
in tumorigenesis in vivo, xenograft and orthotopic
pancreatic tumor models were used in the Balb/c nude
mice. For establishing xenograft tumor, Panc-1 cells were
inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank of the mice
and in orthotopic model, the cells were inoculated into the
pancreas. In xenograft and orthotopic models, mice were
treated by HS-173 intraperitoneally at a dose of 10 mg/
kg (n=8, each group) after 10 days of inoculation. In this
study, we observed that HS-173 dramtically reduced tumor
volume and weight, compared with the control group in
two mouse models (Figure 6A and 6B). Moreover, any
significant changes in the body weight or any adverse
effects were not observed in animals treated with HS173. Moreover, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
values in serum were not significantly changed as well
as there were no abnormality in the H&E of liver tissues
(data not shown). Also, HS-173 significantly increased
expression of TUNEL, cleaved caspase-3 along with
decreased expression of PCNA in tumor tissues (Figure
6C). To further confirm whether or not HS-173 inhibits
tumor growth through the regulation of EMT, we identified
the expression levels of Ecadherin, Vimentin, ZEB1 along

TGF-β/Smad2/3 signaling, leading to the inhibition of
metastasis in pancreatic cacner in vivo models.
EMT can be triggered or regulated by various
growth factors such as TGF-β, FGF, HGF, PDGF,
Wnt, and Notch [36]. Among them, TGF-β has been
identified as a primary driver, and transcription factors
such as ZEB1 and Snail has been shown to be essential
in invoking the broad changes of gene expressions
associated with the mesenchymal cell type [37]. During

tumorigenesis, TGF-β signaling has increased motility,
invasiveness and ultimately metastasis. This event
appears to be the consequence of EMT mediated by the
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [38]. TGF-β has stimulated
AKT phosphorylation via PI3K, resulting in EMT
characterized by reorganization of actin fibers (Vimentin
and Fibronectin) and delocalization of Ecadherin [16].
Therefore, to understand the signaling mechanism
mediated by HS-173, a PI3K inhibitor on EMT

process, we first identified the expression of Vimentin
and Ecadherin, representative EMT markers and then
observed the changes of p-AKT and p-mTOR, which
are downstreams of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in
TGF-β-induced pancreatic cancer cells. Our study showed
that TGF-β acivated the AKT/mTOR signaling and also
increased the expression of Vimentin as well as decreased
that of Ecadherin. However, HS-173 dramatically reversed
these phenomena, resulting in the inhibition of mobility
and invasiveness in pancreatic cancer cells. Other PI3K
inhibitors, LY294002 and BEZ-235 have also inhibited
EMT process by increasing expression of Ecadherin and
decreasing those of Vimentin and Fibronectin in lens
epithelial cells and non-small cell lung cancer cells [39,
40]. These results signify that the effect of HS-173 on
EMT is closely related to its inhibitory activity on the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. In fact, the activation of
PI3K/AKT in cancer is responsible for the dysregulation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of cell growth, survival, proliferation, and notably EMT.
For instance, EMT driven by activated AKT involves the
loss of cell-cell adhesion, morphological changes, loss
of cell polarization, and induction of cell motility [41].
Also, the AKT activation in squamous cancer cells was
shown to undergo EMT and downregulate Ecadherin [41].
In addition, some studies have reported that AKT and
Twist were involved in a positive feedback loop, which
resulted in a series of events that enthaced their pro-EMT
function [42, 43]. Furthermore, Salt et al. have suggested
that mesenchymal cell proliferation can be reversed by
the addition of a PI3K inhibitor [44]. Given that PI3K/
AKT signialing pathway is essential for EMT-mediated
metastasis, HS-173 treatment seems to be an effective
therapy of pancreatic cancer. Additionally, HS-173
downregulated the expression of ZEB1 which is known
as an Ecadherin repressor. ZEB1 is one of the well-known
transcription factors on EMT and metastasis, emerging

resistance to therapy and poor prognosis in breast,
pancreatic, and lung cancer [45]. According to Lehmann
et al., ZEB1 was highly expressed in Panc-1 pancreatic
cancer cells, and mentioned it as an aggressive cancer
cell line [46]. In agreement with the above study, TGF-β
increased the expression of ZEB1 in Panc-1 cells, which
was clearly inhibited by HS-173 treatment. From this
result, we assumed that HS-173 had a strong correlation
between the downregulation of TGF-β-induced EMT and
the inhibition of ZEB1 in pancreatic cancer cells. Besides,
HS-173 showed a significant effect on the phosphorylation
of Smad2/3, which is consistent with the results from the
study by Guanyu et al., showing that BEZ-235, a PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor, inhibited expression of Smad2/3 and Akt
increased by TGF-β in ovarian cancer cells [47].
Most importantly, the effect of HS-173 on EMT in
vitro was also observed in vivo in three mouse pancreatic
cancer models including the xenograft, orthotopic, and
metastasis models. Our study revealed that HS-173
significantly inhibited the primary tumor growth and
metastasis without body weight loss. Since pancreatic
tumors show a high tendency to metastasize to distant
organs such as liver, lung, and lymph node, we identified
the metastasis region and nodules spreading to liver,
lung and lymph node, as parameters of pancreatic tumor
metastasis. Compared with control tumors, HS-173 treated
group (10 and 30 mg/kg) significantly reduced metastasis
to liver, lung and lymph node. Besides, the potential of HS173 on EMT inhibition was confirmed by in vivo results,
showing that the expression of Ecadherin was significantly
increased by HS-173, whereas a mesenchymal marker
Vimentin was decreased. These results are in accordance
with induction of apoptosis due to increased expression of
cleaved caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation, as observed
in TUNEL staining, in parallel with a decrease in PCNA
immunostaining for cell proliferation in tumor tissues.
Consequently, we considered that targeting of PI3K/AKT
signaling pathways by HS-173 may enhance the antitumor
activity via EMT inhibition in pancreatic cancer.
Until now, there has been a variety of potential
pharmacological approaches developed against the EMT
process to prevent or target cancer metastasis. These
approaches include the inhibition of EMT induction and
targeting the invasive mesenchymal cells. In this study,
we found that HS-173 could target invasive mesenchymal
cells and inhibit TGF-β induced EMT, migration, and
invasion of pancreatic cancer cells. Also, upon TGF-β
stimulation, HS-173 blocked the ZEB1 transcription. In
addition, our results revealed that HS-173 inhibited not
only PI3K/AKT signaling but also Smad2/3 signaling
pathway (Figure 7F). Moreover, in the xenograft,
orthotopic, and metastatic mouse models, HS-173 showed
a significant inhibitory effect on tumor growth and EMTmediated metastasis in pancreatic cancer. Therefore,
we suggest that HS-173 might be a potential target for
therapeutic strategy against advanced pancreatic cancer
with metastasis.

Cell culture
Human pancreatic cancer cells (Panc-1, Miapaca-2,
and Aspc-1) were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA). Panc-1 and Miapaca-2 cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Aspc-1 cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial
Institute 1640 (RPMI-1640) media supplemented with
10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. FBS and all
other reagents used for cell culture were purchased from
Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). The cultures were
maintained at 37°C in an incubator with a controlled
humidified atmosphere composed of 95% air and 5% CO2.

Measurement of cell proliferation
Cell viability was performed using an MTT assay. In
brief, cells were seeded at a density of 5000~7000 cells/
well in a 96-well plates following to 24 h incubation. On
the following day the media were removed and the cells
were treated with either vehicle as a negative control or
various concentrations of HS-173 (0.5–10 μM) following
an incubation for 24, 48, or 72 h. After incubation of
respective time 10% of an MTT solution (2 mg/mL)
was added to each well and the cells were incubated for
another 4 h at 37°C. The formazan crystals that formed
were dissolved in DMSO (100 or 300 μL/well) with

constant shaking for 5 min. The absorbance of the plate
was then read with a microplate reader at 540 nm [15].
Three replicate wells were evaluated for each analysis.

lid. Each lid holds approximately 50 droplets. After
loading the droplets, the lid was placed carefully onto
a culture plate containing 5 mL of DPBS and incubated
for 48 and 96 h in Panc-1 and Aspc-1 cells respectively
to form cellular aggregation and then spheroid. The
freshly formed spheroids were then transferred into the
ultra low attachment plate (Corning Inc., Corning, NY,
USA; Cat#3473) containing DMEM/2% FBS. Each well
contained about 50 spheroids. After transfer, the spheroids
were treated with vehicle or with 10 ng/mL TGF-β alone
or TGF-β at various concentration of HS-173 (0.5-10 μM)
and incubated for 72 h. Then, the spheroids were harvested
and used for Western blot and immunofluorescence
microscopic analyses.

Clonogenic assay
Briefly, depending on pancreatic cancer cell lines,
the cells (200-250 cells) were seeded in 6-well plates
and after overnight incubation the cells were treated with
different concentrations of HS-173. After 24 h treatment,
the media were changed and were left the plates for 7-10
days depending on the cell lines. Colonies were fixed and
stained with crystal violet. The plates were photographed
and the colonies were counted using ImageJ. Each
assay was performed in triplicate and only the colonies
containing at least 50 cells were analyzed.

Sphere formation assay

Wound migration assay

The cells were plated in 24-well ultra low attachment
plates (Corning) at a density of 5,000 cells/well in DMEM
(supplemented with 1% N2, 2% B27, 20 ng/mL hFGF,
100 ng/mL hEGF and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). After
overnight incubation the cells were treated by vehicle
or with 10 ng/mL TGF-β alone or TGF-β at various
concentrations of HS-173 (0.5-10 μM) for 10 days. Twice
a week, fresh media supplemented with all factors were
added to cells. After 10 days of incubation, the cells
were observed under the phase contrast microscope and
photographed.

A monolayer of cells were plated on 60-mm culture
dishes, and at 90% confluency a linear wound was made
(~ 4 mm wide) using a 200 μL pipette tip. The detached
cells were washed away by DPBS. Then, the monolayer
was further treated by TGF-β (10 ng/mL) either alone
or with HS-173 (0.5–10 μM). The cells were allowed
to migrate for 16 h, washed with serum-free medium
and fixed in absolute methanol. The migrated cells
were observed under a phase-contrast microscope and
photographed at 200× magnification.

Western blotting

Transwell invasion assay

The cells were washed with DPBS before being
lysed in a lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein were separated
using 8, 10 or 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Protein
transfer was confirmed using a Ponceau S staining
solution (Sigma Aldrich, Ohio, USA). The blots were then
immunostained with the appropriate primary antibodies
(1:1000) followed by appropriate secondary antibodies
(1:5000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The
primary antibodies specific to the interested proteins were
used and detected manually using X-Ray film by enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences,
Piscataway, NJ).

Cell invasions were analyzed in transwell permeable
support systems (24-well plate cell culture inserts with 8.0
μm porous transparent PET membrane, Corning# 353097,
NY, USA). The inserts were coated with 10% matrigel
for 30 min before cell seeding. The cells were starved
for 12 h and seeded at 1 × 105 cells/insert in serumfree medium treated with TGF-β (10 ng/mL) only or in
combination with HS-173 (0.5–10 μM). The outside of
the insert membranes were filled with DMEM medium
supplemented with 10% FBS. After 48 h incubation,
the cells were wiped away from the insert tops and the
cells that invaded through the polycarbonate basement
membrane were stained with crystal violet. The invaded
cells were photographed at 100x magnification and
counted as numbers per field.

Immunofluorescence microscopy

Three-dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroid
cultures

The cells were plated on 18-mm cover glasses in
DMEM at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and incubated for
24 h. Next day the cells were treated with vehicle or 10
ng/mL TGF-β alone or TGF-β at various concentrations
of HS-173 (0.5-10 μM) and incubated for 24 h. The
cells were then washed with DPBS and fixed in an
acetic acid:ethanol (2:1) solution for 5 min. Nonspecific
binding was blocked with 5% goat and horse serum/

Three-dimensional multicellular spheroid cultures
were generated using a modified hanging droplet method
[16]. The pancreatic cancer cells were suspended in
DMEM/10% FBS at a concentration of 50,000 cells/
mL. Then, 20 μL of cell suspension was pipetted onto
the underside of a sterile 10-cm tissue-culture plate

PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and the cells were
then incubated overnight with the primary antibodies
(1:50) in a humidified chamber. After washing twice in
PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescence-labeled
secondary antibody (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature
in the dark. The nuclei were stained with 4, 6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) in the dark for 30 min at room
temperature. The slides were washed twice with PBS,
covered with DABCO (Sigma-Aldrich) and examined
with confocal laser scanning microscopy (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan) at 488 and 568 nm.

experiment, mice were sacrificed and primary pancreatic
tumor was excised from each mouse. Tumors were
weighed, photographed and immediately fixed in 4% PFA
overnight for further immunohistochemistry.

Cancer metastasis model
Miapaca-2 cells (1 × 107) suspended in 50 μL DPBS
were implanted into the spleen of the pancreas using
31G insulin syringe. After 30 days, mice were randomly
separated into three groups with 7 mice in each group;
the control group was treated with vehicle only and the
other two groups were treated with HS-173 (10 or 30
mg/kg) intraperitoneally thrice a week for 25 days. The
body weight was measured thrice a week. At the end
of the experiment (55 days), mice were sacrificed and
primary tumors, liver, lung and lymph nodes were excised
from each mouse. Tumors were weighed, photographed
and immediately fixed in 4% PFA overnight for further
immunohistochemical analysis.

Xenograft models
Male BALB/c mice (4 week old, weighing 18-20
g) were obtained from Orient Bio. Animal Inc. (Seoul,
Republic of Korea). Animal care and all animal related
experimental procedures were conducted in accordance
with the approval and guidelines of the INHA Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (INHA IACUC) of the
Medical School of Inha University (approval ID: INHA
150629-367-2). The animals were fed with standard rat
chow and tap water ad libitum, and were maintained
with a 12 h dark/light cycle at 21°C [3]. After one week
of adaptation period, Panc-1 cells (5 × 106 cells/mice)
were inoculated in the right flank of the mouse. After
reaching an average tumor volume of 50 mm3, mice
were randomly divided into two groups with five mice
in each group; the control group was treated with vehicle
and the experimental group was treated with HS-173 (10
mg/kg) intraperitoneally thrice a week for 26 days. The
body weight and tumor size were measured thrice a week
using the formula, 0.5 × length × width2. At the end of
the experiment, mice were sacrificed and primary tumor
was harvested. Tumors were weighed, photographed, and
divided into two parts for Western blot and IHC analysis.
For IHC analysis, tissues were immediately fixed in 4%
PFA for overnight and for Western blotting analysis,
tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Biochemical analysis
Blood samples were collected from the postcaval
vein and followed by the centrifugation at 570×g for 10
min to obtain serum. Serums were stored at -70°C before
analysis. The levels of AST and ALT were determined
following Reitman and Frankel's method [48] using assay
kits supplied by BioVision (Milpitas, CA). The level of
BUN was measured by a microplate-based colorimetric
enzyme assay kit (BioVision).

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining was performed
using formalin-fixed and deparaffinized tissue sections
as previously described [15]. Briefly, the tumor tissue
sections were blocked with normal goat or horse
serum (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h and incubated at
4°C overnight in 1:50 dilutions of primary antibodies
against Ecadherin, Vimentin, ZEB1, TUNEL, PCNA
and p-Smad2. The sections were then incubated with
biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:100) for 1 h. The
sections were visualized by an avidin-biotin peroxidase
complex solution using an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories),
which were then washed in PBS and developed with a
diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) substrate for
15 min, and then counterstained with hematoxylin. At least
3 randomly selected fields for each section were examined
at 200x magnification and analyzed.

Orthotopic models
After one week of adaptation period, Panc-1
cells (8 × 106 cells/mice) were orthotopically implanted
in the pancreas of nude mice. A total of six mice were
anesthetized by Zoletil : Rompun (9:1) solution and a
small left abdominal flank incision was made. About
8 × 106 cells suspended in 200 μL DPBS were injected into
the subcapsular region of the pancreas using 31G insulin
syringe. The peritoneum and skin incisions were closed
sequentially with 9 mm wound autoclips. After 10 days,
mice were randomly separated into two groups with 3 mice
in each group. Mice in the experimental group received 10
mg/kg HS-173 for 6 weeks (3 times/week, i.p.), whereas
the control mice received vehicle only. The dose of HS173 was selected based on previous reports [13, 14]. The
body weight was measured thrice a week. At the end of the
