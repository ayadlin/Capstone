Abstract
Over the past decade, our understanding of the molecular and cellular
mechanisms presiding over cellular and tissue decline with aging has greatly
advanced. Classical hallmarks of aging cell include increasing levels of reactive oxygen
species, DNA damage and senescence entry, which disrupt tissue architecture and
function. Tissue dysfunction with aging has been shown to correlate with a cellular
switch from a G0 reversible quiescence state into a G0 irreversible senescence
state (geroconversion), causing a permanent proliferative block. The TOR (target
of rapamycin) kinase has been shown to promote geroconversion. Rapamycin and
other rapalogs specifically suppress activity of the mammalian TOR (mTOR) complex
1 (mTORC1) -but not mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)- and decrease senescence entry,
thus preserving proliferative potential. In this perspective, we briefly comment recent
progress of Leontieva and colleagues showing a new class of non-rapalog drugs that
target simultaneously mTORC1 and mTORC2 and prevent geroconversion in a more
efficient way than rapamycin. Its potential future use as rejuvenating, anti-aging
therapeutics is therefore proposed.

Aging is a nearly universal process affecting
all tissues of an organism and can be defined as the
accumulation of damage in molecules, cells and tissues
over a lifetime. A hallmark of aging is alteration of
organismal homeostasis and progressive decline of tissue
functions [1, 2]. In addition, aging has been associated to
cellular senescence [3]. However, the most striking and
compelling prove of this link came from the van Deursen
lab, whereby removal of senescent cells by genetic
manipulation in a progeric mouse model delayed the
aging phenotype and related disease [4]. Senescent cells
are dysfunctional cells that are permanently withdrawn
from the cell cycle and have ceased proliferation [5].
This is distinct to the reversible cell cycle arrest of
quiescent cells, which can maintain re-proliferative
potential (RP) [6]. Recently, stem cells of skeletal muscle
from aged mice have been shown to lose their normal
reversible quiescence state and acquire an irreversible
senescent state, correlating with an age-associated tissue
regenerative decline. This demonstrated an age associated

quiescence-to-senescence transition in physiological
aging. Furthermore, this supported that promoting
cell quiescence in aging, or preventing senescence,
may constitute potential anti-aging strategies for the
increasing elderly human population. In cultured cells, this
quiescence-to-senescence transition leading to gerogenic
conversion is known as geroconversion [7].
Although no single hallmark can be used to
define senescence, this state is characterized by cellular
hypertrophy, SA-β-Gal staining and hyper-secretory
phenotypes [8, 9]. Senescence is thus a driving force
of age-related pathologies by both acting on stem cells
to limit tissues regenerative potential and through the
secretory role in a pro-inflammatory condition known
as inflammaging [10]. Understanding the mechanisms
involved in establishing the senescent arrest may help
design strategies to delay or reverse age-dependent loss
of tissue function and regenerative capacity. Work from
the Blagosklonny group has shown that in arrested cells,
geroconversion depends on mTOR [7, 11]. Observations

Figure 1: Quiescence vs. Senescence. In the G0 phase of the cell cycle, mTOR levels determine cell cycle reversibility. High levels
of mTOR drive cells to an irreversible senescence state (geroconversion), while mTOR inhibition by rapalogs, such as Torin1 and PP242,
maintain cells in the quiescence state and preserve their re-proliferative potential (gerosuppression).

that cellular hypertrophy in senescent cells in culture was a
consequence of mTOR activity and that inhibiting mTOR
allowed for the preservation of RP in the presence of a
cell cycle arrest established a close link between growth
pathways and senescence. Indeed, in cells arrested by the
CDK inhibitors p16 and p21, mTOR inhibitor rapamycin
decelerates the cell gerogenic conversion (geroconversion)
to senescence [11]. Thus, mTOR pathway inhibition
appears as a possible gerosuppressing (anti-aging)
strategy.
In this issue of Oncotarget, Leontieva et al show that
this concept is extensive to a new class of non-rapalog
drugs that target simultaneously mTORC1 and mTORC2.
Torin1 and PP242 are ATP-competitive inhibitors of
mTOR kinase activity and thus inhibit the function of
both complexes [12]. The authors show a dose-dependent
effect of these drugs in preventing geroconversion of
cells in culture. In the experiments reported senescence
was induced by three different methods in three different
cellular contexts - (1) p21-expression in HT1080 human
cells; (2) etoposide/doxorubicin treatment of WI38t human
fibroblasts and (3) PMA treatment of SKBR3 breast
adenocarcinoma cell line. In all cases cell cycle arrest
leads to geroconversion, as measured by the lack of reproliferating capacity upon withdrawal of the senescence
stimulus. Importantly, treatment with Torin1 or PP242
prevented senescence phenotypes and geroconversion,
correlating with inhibition of mTOR activity. Interestingly,
Torin1 and PP242 were more efficient at suppressing the
senescent morphology and hypertrophy than rapamycin,
suggesting that these cell characteristics partially depend
on the rapamycin-insensitive functions of mTOR [13].

Several studies indicate that the link between
mTOR signaling and aging and longevity is conserved
across species [14]. While rapamycin has now extensive
experimental support as a potential anti-aging intervention
in mammals [15], the use of dual mTOR inhibitors will
likely carry increased potential for side effects. However,
the demonstration that pan-mTOR inhibitors at low
concentrations are capable of suppressing geroconversion
and preserving RP [13] reinforces their potential future use
as anti-aging therapeutics.
Since geroconversion is a phenomena that occurs
to stem cells in vivo during physiological aging [16,
17], and because in vivo elimination of senescent cells
delayed aging and age-associated diseases [4], exploration
of a larger variety of gerosuppressive drugs (such as
mTOR inhibitors) can contribute to the development of
rejuvenation strategies.
