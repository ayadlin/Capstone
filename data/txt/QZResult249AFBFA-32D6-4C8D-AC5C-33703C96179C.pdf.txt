Abstract
Formation of microtubules is a dynamic process that involves polymerization and depolymerization of
ab-tubulin heterodimers. Drugs that enhance or inhibit tubulin polymerization can destroy this dynamic
process, arresting cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Although drugs that target tubulin generally
demonstrate cytotoxic potency in the subnanomolar range, resistance due to drug efflux is a common
phenomenon among the antitubulin agents. We recently reported a class of 4-substituted methoxybenzoylaryl-thiazoles (SMART) that exhibited great in vitro potency and broad spectrum cellular cytotoxicity. Evaluation
of the in vitro and in vivo anticancer activities of 3 SMART compounds, SMART-H (H), SMART-F (F), and SMARTOH (OH), with varying substituents at the 4-position of aryl ring, demonstrated that they bind potently to the
colchicine-binding site in tubulin, inhibit tubulin polymerization, arrest cancer cells in G2/M phase of the cell
cycle, and induce their apoptosis. The SMART compounds also equipotently inhibit the growth of parental and
MDR-overexpressing cells in vitro, indicating that they can overcome multidrug resistance. In vivo antitumor
efficacy studies in human prostate (PC-3) and melanoma (A375) cancer xenograft models demonstrated that
SMART-H and SMART-F treatments resulted in %T/C values ranging from 4% to 30%. In addition, in vivo
SMART-H treatment for 21 days at the higher dose (15 mg/kg) failed to produce any apparent neurotoxicity.
These studies provide the first in vivo evidence and proof-of-concept that SMART compounds are similarly
efficacious to currently FDA approved antitubulin drugs for cancer treatment, but they can circumvent
P-glycoprotein-mediated drug resistance. Cancer Res; 71(1); 216–24. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Microtubules, composed of ab-tubulin heterodimers, play
an important role in cell mitosis, motility, and organelle
distribution (1). Formation of microtubules from tubulin is
a dynamic process that involves polymerization and depolymerization and is crucial for mitosis (2). Interference with
tubulin-microtubule dynamics is one of the most attractive
and successful molecular strategies to treat cancer (3, 4).
Paclitaxel, docetaxel, ixabepilone, and 3 vinca alkaloids (vinblastine, vincristine, and vinorelbine), all FDA approved drugs,
effectively inhibit tubulin action and successfully treat cancer
(5).

The taxanes and epothilones are semisynthetic natural
products that stabilize microtubules and cause apoptosis
(5). Paclitaxel and ixabepilone occupy overlapping binding
sites on the surface of b-tubulin (6) and demonstrate nanomolar cytotoxicity in a variety of cancer cell lines. Unlike
paclitaxel and docetaxel, ixabepilone demonstrates reduced
susceptibility to drug resistance mechanisms that limit the
effectiveness of taxanes, anthracyclines and a host of other
anticancer agents (7). The overexpression of ATP binding
cassette (ABC) proteins, most notably P-glycoprotein (P-gp),
in many cancer cells and tumors results in innate or acquired
resistance to chemotherapy (8). The ability of ixabepilone to
circumvent these multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanisms
has provided a unique chemotherapeutic approach for
patients with anthracyclines or taxanes resistant tumors.
An orally bioavailable sulfonamide (ABT-751) that inhibits
tubulin polymerization and maintains activity in cells expressing P-gp is currently being evaluated in phase I trials (9, 10),
but is not yet available for routine clinical use. Despite the
widespread use of the vinca alkaloids for the treatment of
cancer and their susceptibility to these same MDR mechanisms, an anticancer agent that destabilizes microtubules and
effectively circumvents P-gp–mediated drug resistance is not
yet approved for clinical use.
We recently reported the synthesis and in vitro anticancer characterization of a novel series of 4-substituted

SMART Compounds are Potent Antitubulin Agents

methoxybenzoyl-aryl-thiazoles (SMART; ref. 11). SMART compounds were synthesized in a simple 4-step procedure, providing a method for rapid and high yield synthesis of a variety of
analogs. Compounds with an unsubstituted aryl ring (SMARTH) or bearing a 4-fluoro substituent (SMART-F) were the most
active, with IC50 values ranging from 6 to 55 nmol/L. The earlier
report further revealed that the presence of 3, 4, 5-trimethoxyphenyl ring is essential for the inhibition of tubulin function.
In this study, we synthesized and characterized an additional
4-hydroxy SMART compound (SMART-OH) to improve the
solubility of the parent SMART-H. We examined the binding of
SMART-H to tubulin, demonstrated that the compounds inhibit tubulin polymerization via binding to the colchicine binding site on tubulin, showed that these compounds circumvent
P-gp–mediated MDR, and demonstrated promising in vivo
antitumor activity in mice bearing human prostate cancer
(PC-3) and melanoma (A375) tumors. The discovery of these
SMART drugs may provide a novel pharmacologic alternative
to the MDR exhibited by several cancers upon prolonged
exposure to taxane, anthracycline and the vinca alkaloids.

Materials and Methods
In vitro microtubule polymerization assay
Bovine brain tubulin (0.4 mg; Cytoskeleton) was mixed with
10 mmol/L of the test compound or vehicle (DMSO) and
incubated in 100 mL of buffer (80 mmol/L PIPES, 2.0 mmol/
L MgCl2, 0.5 mmol/L EGTA, pH 6.9, and 1 mmol/L GTP). The
absorbance at 340 nm wavelength was monitored every
minute for 15 minutes (SYNERGY 4 Microplate Reader, BioTek Instruments). The spectrophotometer was maintained at
37 C for tubulin polymerization.
Cell culture and cytotoxicity assay of prostate
carcinoma and melanoma cell lines
All prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145,
PPC-1) and melanoma cell lines (A375 and WM-164) were
obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection).
Human ovarian cell line OVCAR-8 and its resistant cell line
that overexpresses P-gp, NCI/ADR-RES, were used as MDR
models. Both ovarian cell lines were obtained from National
Cancer Institutes (NCI). All cell lines were tested and authenticated by either ATCC or NCI. All cell lines obtained from
ATCC or NCI were immediately expanded and frozen down
such that all cell lines could be restarted every 2 to 3 months
from a frozen vial of the same batch of cells. Cell culture
supplies were purchased from Cellgro Mediatech. All cell lines
were used to test the antiproliferative activity of SMART
compounds by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay as previous
described (11). All prostate and ovarian cancer cell lines were
maintained in RPMI 1640 media with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), whereas melanoma cancer
cell lines were maintained in DMEM media with 2 mmol/L Lglutamine and 5% FBS.
Cell-cycle analysis
Flow cytometry was performed to study the effects of the
SMART compounds on cell-cycle distribution. PC-3 and A375

www.aacrjournals.org

cells were treated in growth media with the indicated concentrations of SMART-H, SMART-F, and SMART-OH for 24
hours. Cellular DNA was stained with 100 mg/mL propidium
iodide and 100 mg/mL RNase A in PBS and flow cytometry was
performed to determine the cell-cycle distribution of the cells.
Apoptosis detection by ELISA
Quantification of the enrichment of mononucleosomes and
oligonucleosomes in the cytoplasm was used to determine the
ability of the SMART compounds to induce apoptosis (cell
death detection ELISA PLUS; Roche) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Pharmacokinetic study
Male ICR mice (n ¼ 3 or 4 per group) 6 to 8 weeks of age
were purchased from Harlan Inc., and used to examine the
pharmacokinetics (PK) of the SMART compounds. SMART-F
and SMART-OH (15 mg/kg) were dissolved in PEG300/DMSO
(1/4) and administered by a single intravenous. injection into
the tail vein. Blood samples were collected at 2, 5, 15, and 30
minutes, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours after administration.
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n ¼ 4; 254  4 g) were purchased
from Harlan Inc. . SMART-F was administered intravenously
into the jugular venous catheters at 2.5 mg/kg (in DMSO/
PEG300, 1/4). Blood samples (250 mL) were collected at 10, 20,
30 minutes, and 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 hours.
A protein precipitation method was used for sample
preparation. An aliquot (200 mL) of acetonitrile (ACN) was
added to 100 mL of plasma and then was thoroughly vortexed
for 15 seconds. After centrifugation, the supernatant was
analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The PK parameters were determined
using non compartmental analysis (WinNonlin, Pharsight
Corporation).
PC-3 and A375 tumor xenograft studies
PC-3 and A375 cells (5  107 per mL) were prepared in
phenol red-free growth media containing 10% FBS, and mixed
with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at 1:1 ratio. Tumors were
established by injecting 100 mL of the mixture (2.5  106 cells
per animal) subcutaneously into the flank of 6 to 8-week-old
male athymic nude mice. Length and width of tumors were
measured, and the tumor volume (mm3) was calculated by the
formula, p/6  L  W2, where length (L) and width (W) were
determined in mm. When the tumor volumes reached 150
mm3, the animals bearing PC-3 tumors were treated intraperitoneally with vehicle [Captex200/Tween80 (1/4)], SMART-H
(5 and 15 mg/kg), SMART-F (5 and 15 mg/kg), and SMART-OH
(50 mg/kg) for 21 days. Vinblastine (0.5 mg/kg) was used as the
positive control and dosed q2d with vehicle [DMSO/PEG300
(1/9)]. On the other hand, A375 tumor bearing mice were
treated for 34 days with vehicle [Captex200/Tween80 (1/4)],
SMART-H (20 mg/kg) or SMART-F (15 mg/kg). Doses were
selected based on acute toxicity studies of SMART-H and
SMART-F in ICR mice (n ¼ 2/group) showing that doses up to
30 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, respectively, did not cause greater
than 10% loss of body weight after 4 consecutive days of
intraperitoneal dosing.

Rotarod test
ICR mice received training 3 times a day for 2 days to enable
them to stay on the rotating rod for more than 120 seconds at
12 rpm. Mice were then randomized by the length of time that
they could stay on the rotating rod and divided into 7 to 8 mice
per group. SMART-H at a dose of 5 or 15 mg/kg in Captex200/
Tween80 (1/4) was administered by intraperitoneal injection.
Vinblastine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/d was used as a positive
control under the same conditions. The rotarod test was
performed twice a week. Treatment was stopped on day 31,
and postobservation was examined on weeks 1, 2, and 4 after
termination of the treatment. The rod speed was increased
from 5 to 40 rpm over a period of 5 minutes. Performance was
measured as the length of time that a mouse could stay on the
rotating rod.
In vivo drug resistance studies
At the end of the PC-3 xenograft studies, solid tumors from
control and SMART-H treated (15 mg/kg) groups were
removed and digested with 0.1% collagenase (type I) and 50
mg/mL of DNase (Worthington Biochemical Corporation).
Dispersed cells were plated in RPMI medium þ 10% FBS
and incubated at 37 C and 5% CO2 for 24 hours to allow
attachment. The antiproliferative effects of SMART-H were
compared with determine whether tumor cells remaining in
PC-3 xenografts retained sensitivity to drug. The PC-3 cells
obtained from ATCC were used as in vitro control. Statistical
analyses were performed using simple Student's t test.

Results
On the basis of structure–activity relationship studies, 3
SMART compounds (Fig. 1A) were selected for biological
characterization. Although SMART-H and SMART-F are
highly potent molecules with low nanomolar cytotoxic properties, SMART-OH, which was rationally designed as a potential
metabolite with improved solubility, had the least potent
antiproliferative effects (Table 1).
SMARTs inhibit microtubule polymerization by binding
to the colchicine binding site on tubulin
Bovine brain tubulin (>97% pure) was incubated with the
individual SMART compounds (10 mmol/L) to test their effect
on tubulin polymerization (Fig. 1B). Whereas SMART-H and
SMART-F inhibited tubulin polymerization by 90%, SMARTOH inhibited the polymerization by only 55%. Previous studies
demonstrated a concentration-dependent inhibition of tubulin polymerization by SMART-H. In addition, under the same
experimental conditions, the IC50 for SMART-H (4.23 mmol/L)
is similar to that of colchicine (4.91 mmol/L). These data

suggest that SMART compounds exhibit strong antitubulin
polymerization activity that corresponds well with their cytotoxicity (Table 1).
The ability of the SMART compounds to compete for known
binding sites on tubulin was determined using a novel MS
competitive binding assay, which was developed in our laboratory (13). Three tubulin ligands, corresponding to the 3 binding sites on tubulin, colchicine, vinblastine, and paclitaxel
were used for these competitive binding studies. We found
that, SMART-H specifically competed with colchicine binding
to tubulin, but it did not compete with either vinblastine or
paclitaxel binding to tubulin.
SMART compounds inhibit the growth of multidrugresistant cancer cell lines
The ability of SMART compounds to inhibit the growth of
cancer cell lines was evaluated using the SRB assay. As shown
in Table 1, the SMART compounds inhibited the growth of
several human cancer cell lines, including 4 prostate cancer
cell lines, and 2 melanoma cell lines, with IC50 values in the low
nanomolar range. Of the 3 SMART compounds, SMART-OH
was the least potent (IC50 76–116 nmol/L). SMART-F exhibited
the best antiproliferative effect with IC50 values between 6 and
43 nmol/L in prostate cancer and melanoma cell lines. In
addition, the effect of SMART compounds in the OVCAR-8 and
NCI/ADR-RES cell lines was also evaluated (Table 1). SMART
compounds were equally potent against MDR cell (NCI/
ADR-RES) and the parent cell line (OVCAR-8). Paclitaxel,

vinblastine, and colchicine exhibited relative resistance values
of 1,333, 149, and 65 times, respectively. These data indicate
that the SMART compounds circumvent P-gp–mediated drug
resistance.
SMART compounds arrest PC-3 (prostate) and A375
(melanoma) cells in G2/M phase of cell cycle and induce
cell apoptosis
PC-3 and A375 cells were exposed to 10, 50, 200, and 1,000
nmol/L of SMART compounds for 24 hours. Treatment of both
cell lines with SMART compounds resulted in concentrationdependent accumulation of both PC-3 and A375 cells in the
G2/M phase with concomitant decreases in the percentage of
cells in G0/G1 phase (Fig. 2A and B). The proportion of cells in
G2/M phase significantly increased when treated with 50 to
200 nmol/L of SMART-H, SMART-F, and SMART-OH.
Apoptosis was then examined by measuring the level of
cytoplasmic DNA–histone complexes in PC-3 and A375 cells
after a 24-hour treatment. Increasing concentration of the
SMART compounds increased the level of cytoplasmic DNA–
histone complexes in PC-3 and A375 cells (Fig. 2C and D). The
effect was more pronounced in A375 cells than in PC-3 cells,
but apoptosis was evident in both cell types. SMART-H and
SMART-F induced moderate apoptosis at a concentration of
50 nmol/L, whereas SMART-OH induced apoptosis only at
concentrations of 200 nmol/L or greater.
In vivo PK profile of SMART compounds
A single bolus dose of SMART-F and SMART-OH (15 mg/
kg) was administered by tail vein injection to ICR mice to
characterize their PK (Fig. 3A). SMART-H and SMART-F
exhibited similar PK properties, but SMART-OH exhibited
slightly greater AUC than SMART-H and SMART-F, indicative of a lower clearance for SMART-OH (Table 2). SMARTOH also had 2 to 3 times higher Vss than that of SMART-H
and SMART-F. The clearance values for all 3 SMARTs were
90 mL/min/kg or greater (the hepatic blood flow rate in

www.aacrjournals.org

mice; ref. 14), suggesting that in addition to hepatic removal,
other degradation routes may be involved in the elimination
of SMARTs.
The PK of SMART-F (2.5 mg/kg) was also examined in rats
(Fig. 3B). Interestingly, low clearance values and hepatic
extraction rates were obtained by SMART-F and SMART-H
(Table 2), suggesting that SMART compounds exhibit species
differences in clearance. In rats, SMART-H and SMART-F
exhibited favorable PK properties, which are low clearance,
moderate volume of distribution, long half-life, and high
exposure (AUC; Table 2).
SMART compounds inhibit prostate and melanoma
xenografts growth without neurotoxicity
PC-3 prostate cancer and A375 melanoma tumor xenografts in mice were allowed to reach a volume of 150 mm3
and then tumor-bearing mice were treated with the SMART
compounds. As shown in Fig. 4A, tumor volumes in the
control group increased to 680  198 mm3 over the 21-day
duration of the study. Tumor volumes in the SMART-Htreated group increased to 370  103 mm3 (5 mg/kg treatment) and 176  112 mm3 (15 mg/kg treatment) by day 21,
indicating effective antitumor activity for this compound.
Tumors in the SMART-F-treated animals increased to 269 
177 mm3 (5 mg/kg treatment) and 292  103 mm3 (15 mg/kg
treatment), whereas animals in the SMART-OH (50 mg/kg)
treated group had tumors of 331  130 mm3 at day 21. This
reduction in tumor volume reversed upon withdrawal of
SMART compounds (data not shown). Table 3 summarized
the in vivo efficacy (%T/C) of SMART compounds. SMART-H
tumor elicited %T/C of 29% and 4% at 5 and 15 mg/kg
treatment, respectively, whereas, SMART-F elicited %T/C of
21% and 24% at 5 and 15 mg/kg treatment, respectively. The
high dose of SMART-OH (50 mg/kg) exhibited the %T/C of
34%. Vinblastine, the positive control, showed %T/C of 29%
at day 22 in PC-3 xenografts (Fig. 4B). Body weight measurements, to monitor toxicity, indicated that only 1 of 8 mice

treated with SMART-H (15 mg/kg), and 2 of 7 mice treated
with SMART-F (15 mg/kg) lost more than 15% body weight.
In addition to the antitumor effects of the SMART compounds on PC-3 prostate tumors, SMART-H (20 mg/kg) and
SMART-F (15 mg/kg) demonstrated a significant reduction
of A375 tumors. As shown in Fig. 4C, the tumor volumes of
control group increased to 2,183  279 mm3, whereas the
volumes in SMART-H and SMART-F treatment groups
increased to 775  107 mm3 and 722  135 mm3, respectively. SMART-H and SMART-F treatment resulted in %T/C
indices of 28% and 29%, respectively.
Rotarod tests were performed to examine the possible in
vivo neurotoxic effects of SMART-H. On the basis of the result
of in vivo efficacy experiments, 5 or 15 mg/kg [intraperitoneal
administration, Captex200/Tween80 (1/4)] of SMART-H was
chosen to study the effect on motor coordination. A 0.5 mg/kg
treatment with vinblastine was used as the positive control
under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 4D, vinblastine
gradually reduced the time (in seconds) that the mice could

stay on the rotating rod, and attained significance by days 27
and 31 (P < 0.05) compared with the vehicle group. However,
no significant difference was observed in the SMART-H treatment groups, suggesting that SMART-H did not cause neurotoxicity in ICR mice at doses that are associated with
antitumor effects.
SMART-H did not develop drug resistance in PC-3
tumor-bearing mice
We excised the PC-3 tumors from nude mice after 21 days of
treatment with vehicle (n ¼ 3) or 15 mg/kg SMART-H (n ¼ 3).
Solid tumors were digested and dispersed into cells as
described in the methods section. PC-3 cell line from ATCC
was used as a control. IC50 values were 29.1  1.1, 29.1  0.8,
and 30.4  0.5 nmol/L in PC-3 cells from ATCC, and dissociated cells from vehicle and SMART-H treated tumors,
respectively. These data demonstrate that SMART-H did
not induce drug resistance in PC-3 tumors after 21 days of
continuous SMART-H treatment.

Discussion
The general molecular mechanism of action of antitubulin
agents is to bind to microtubules, arrest cells in G2/M phase,
and cause cell apoptosis. In this study, we examined the ability
of 3 novel SMART compounds to bind tubulin, inhibit its

polymerization and induce apoptosis in 2 tumor cell types.
The SMART compounds bound to the colchicine-binding site
in tubulin, disturbed tubulin polymerization, arrested cells in
the G2/M phase, induced apoptosis, and displayed potent
antiproliferative activities against prostate and melanoma cell
lines in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with these biological
effects, the in vivo antiproliferative activity of SMART-H and
SMART-F were greater than SMART-OH.
Currently, there are many potential microtubule stabilizers
or destabilizers in various stages of development (15). Some
antimitotic compounds, such as the vinca alkaloids and
taxanes, are already in clinical use. However, the vinca alkaloids and taxanes are substrates of P-gp, which pumps drugs
out of cancer cells and is thought to limits their effectiveness.
Compared with other drug classes, antitubulin agents have
somewhat different resistance mechanisms. For example,
overexpression of P-gp, changes in microtubule dynamics
(16) and mutations in b-tubulin are known to limit sensitivity
to the taxanes (17). Two mechanisms of drug resistance have
been examined with the SMART compounds in this study: (a)
the presence of drug efflux pumps and (b) development of
drug resistance by tumor in vivo. We tested SMART compounds against a cell line that overexpresses P-gp. Notably, the
SMART compounds demonstrated equipotent antiproliferative effects against OVCAR-8 (parent) and NCI/ADR-RES
(MDR-positive) cell line, suggesting that SMART compounds
are not P-gp substrates and that they function in a P-gp–
independent manner. This feature differs from that of paclitaxel, vinblastine, and colchicine in NCI/ADR-RES cells. We
also examined the cytotoxicity of SMART-H in PC-3 tumor
cells (in vivo) excised from mice, which were treated with 15
mg/kg of SMART-H for 21 days. SMART-H equipotently
inhibited the growth of cells derived from the primary tumor
cell culture and ATCC PC-3 cell line, indicating that prolonged
treatment with SMART-H did not develop drug resistance in
PC-3 tumors over 21 days.
Many drug candidates encounter problems during development associated with chemical instability, high metabolic
clearance, and peripheral neurotoxicity (18–20). We performed
PK studies with the SMART compounds in mice, and found
that the SMART compounds exhibited high clearance. On the

basis of metabolic stability studies using liver microsomes in
vitro, we predicted that the high clearance observed in mice
may be due to rapid hepatic metabolism (C. M. Li et al.; ref. 21).
However, the SMART compounds exhibited species differences
in metabolism, and were more stable in liver microsomes
obtained from rats, dogs, and human. We also performed
PK studies in rats. Total plasma clearances of SMART-H and
SMART-F in rats were 6 and 11 mL/min/kg, respectively,
indicative of a low hepatic extraction rate (rat hepatic blood
rate is 55 mL/min/kg; ref. 14). These PK data demonstrate that
in vitro metabolic stability studies provided a reliable predic-

tion for in vivo clearance in animals. It is hoped that xenograft
studies in mice may underestimate the antitumor efficacy
achievable in humans due to interspecies differences in metabolism. We developed a suitable formulation to increase drug
exposure after intraperitoneal injection. We compared the
AUC (drug exposure) using 2 different formulations and intraperitoneal injection prior to the initiation of tumor xenograft
studies. SMART-H (15 mg/kg) in Captex200/Tween80 (1/4)
exhibited 4-fold higher AUC compared with the PEG300/DMSO
(1/4) formulation, indicating that the Captex200/Tween80 (1/
4) formulation facilitated a greater exposure to SMART-H (data

not shown). On the basis of PK data (high clearance and short
half-life) from mice, we employed a high frequency dosing
regimen. The promising in vivo antitumor activity of SMART-H
and SMART-F in a species that rapidly eliminates these drugs,
coupled with their improved stability in human liver microsomes, further supports the view that these SMART compounds may possess better anticancer activity in human
patients than in mice with prostate cancer or melanoma
xenografts.
One of the major adverse events associated with antitubulin
agents is peripheral neurotoxicity. The rotarod assay has been
used to examine in vivo neurotoxicity (22, 23). In this report,
the rotarod assay was conducted to test peripheral neurotoxicity of SMART-H in ICR mice. Mice treated with SMART-H
did not show significant impairment in motor coordination
compared with that of mice in the vehicle group. The positive
control, vinblastine-treated group, demonstrated a lesser ability to stay on the rotating rod, indicative of neurotoxicity. We
also extended the experiment for 4 weeks after drug treatment
was stopped, and found that the ability of the vinblastinetreated group to stay on the rotating rod failed to return to
baseline or to values of the vehicle-treated group, indicating
that neurotoxicity was only partially reversible with time. The
postobservation also ruled out delayed neurotoxicity in
SMART treatment groups. These data provide compelling
evidence that we have developed a novel family of SMART
compounds with lesser neurotoxicity.
Prostate cancer PC-3 and melanoma A375 cells were chosen
to examine the activity of SMART compounds in vivo because
SMART compounds exhibited greater potency in these cancer
cell lines in vitro. A375 xenografts exhibited higher tumor
growth rate than PC-3 xenografts. This corresponded well
with their in vitro growth rate. In this report, SMART-H and
SMART-F both showed significant efficacy on both low and
high growth rate xenograft models in vivo. Compared to the
control groups, SMART-H and SMART-F inhibited tumor
growth significantly at doses between 5 and 20 mg/kg. We
obtained %T/C indices of 4% to 30% with SMART-H and
SMART-F treatments in both xenograft models. Under conditions of initial efficacy testing, it would appear that SMARTH at 15 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, qDx21 is the most active
treatment regimen (a %T/C ¼ 4% is recorded in Table 3).
Moreover, in Figure 4A, a plot of mean tumor masses shows a
reduction in tumor masses on day 3 with at least partially
regressed tumors and/or a continuation of blunted growth
over the remaining duration of treatment. Of interest,
we found that tumor sizes were lower than their initial sizes

(150 mm3) in 4 of 7 mice after 21 days treatment, suggesting
that this treatment elicited partial regressions in these animals. Animal body weight measurements in the PC-3 tumor
model showed that 1 of 8 mice treated with SMART-H at 15
mg/kg and 2 of 7 mice treated with SMART-F lost more than
15% body weight within 21 days of treatment. However, no
appreciable animal body weight losses were identified for the
A 375 model treated longer (for 34 days) with SMART-H at 20
mg/kg or SMART-F at 15 mg/kg. It was thought that 15 to 20
mg/kg of SMART-H and SMART-F are close to the boundary of
toxicity, and hence, we obtained 15% body weight loss in one
animal study, not in the other. To confirm index of drug
toxicity, we will need more treatment groups, such as 10 and
25 mg/kg treatments in further studies. Though SMART-OH,
was tested at a dose higher than that of SMART-H and
SMART-F, and demonstrated more favorable PK properties,
it exhibited 10-fold less potency than SMART-H at higher
dosage in the PC-3 xenograft model (Fig. 4A). Thus, the lower
tubulin inhibitory potency of SMART-OH was not sufficiently
compensated by its lower clearance and greater exposure.
These data further suggest that SMART-OH, a metabolite of
SMART-H, would contribute little, if any, to the in vivo anticancer activity of SMART-H.
In summary, we have demonstrated that SMART compounds are potent antitubulin compounds that overcome
P-gp–mediated drug resistance in vitro and which, in fact,
are highly active anticancer agents both in vitro and in vivo. In
contrast to 3 clinical antitubulin agents, SMART compounds
are highly active in an Adriamycin-resistant cancer cell line.
The efficacy studies revealed that SMART compounds have
activities in PC-3 and A375 cancer xenografts. Importantly,
SMART-H did not show neurotoxicity in vivo and tumor cells
treated in vivo did not develop drug resistance. The in vitro and
in vivo anticancer effect of the SMART compounds and the
lesser neurotoxicity observed in this study serve as a preclinical basis to suggest that these novel compounds may have
therapeutic potential for cancer therapy in the clinic.
