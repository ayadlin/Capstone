ABSTRACT
Brain tumors, either primary (e.g., glioblastoma multiforme) or secondary
(metastatic), remain among the most intractable and fatal of all cancers. We have
shown that nanovesicles consisting of Saposin C (SapC) and dioleylphosphatidylserine
(DOPS) are able to effectively target and kill cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.
These actions are a consequence of the affinity of SapC-DOPS for phosphatidylserine,
an acidic phospholipid abundantly present in the outer membrane of a variety of
tumor cells and tumor-associated vasculature. In this study, we first characterize
SapC-DOPS bioavailability and antitumor effects on human glioblastoma xenografts,
and confirm SapC-DOPS specificity towards phosphatidylserine by showing that
glioblastoma targeting is abrogated after in vivo exposure to lactadherin, which
binds phosphatidylserine with high affinity. Second, we demonstrate that SapC-DOPS
selectively targets brain metastases-forming cancer cells both in vitro, in co-cultures
with human astrocytes, and in vivo, in mouse models of brain metastases derived
from human breast or lung cancer cells. Third, we demonstrate that SapC-DOPS
nanovesicles have cytotoxic activity against metastatic breast cancer cells in vitro,
and prolong the survival of mice harboring brain metastases. Taken together, these
results support the potential of SapC-DOPS for the diagnosis and therapy of primary
and metastatic brain tumors.

INTRODUCTION

males up to the age of 40, and approximately 22,000 new
cases of malignant brain tumors were detected in the US
per year between 2006 and 2010 [5]. Unfortunately, a
large number of clinical trials have produced only modest
benefits regarding GBM recurrence prevention and patient
survival [6]. Brain metastases arise mainly from primary
lung, skin, and breast cancers, affect 10-30% of adult
cancer patients and are much more prevalent than primary
brain tumors [7]. Although new targeted therapies are
showing promising results [8], the difficulty in diagnosing
and effectively targeting small micrometastases makes

Standard cancer therapies that often show good
results in systemic cancers usually fail to deter the
progression of brain tumors [1, 2]. As a consequence,
compared with most extracranial tumors, the prognosis for
both glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive
and prevalent malignant brain tumor, and for secondary
(metastatic) brain tumors is very poor, with a median
survival of one year or less [3, 4]. Primary brain tumors
are the second leading cause of cancer-related death in

the treatment of brain metastases one of the most pressing
challenges in clinical oncology.
We developed a nanovesicle composed of two
naturally-occurring molecules, saposin C (SapC)–
dioleylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) that show diagnostic
and antitumor capabilities both in vitro and in vivo [911]. Saposin C (SapC) is a small (80 amino acids), stable,
acidic lysosomal protein with fusogenic affinity for
phosphatidylserine-enriched membranes that functions
as a critical co-activator of lysosomal enzymes such as
sphingomyelinase and acid beta-glucosidase [12, 13].
Increased exposure of phosphatidylserine characterizes the
membrane surfaces of tumor cells and tumor-associated
vasculatures [14, 15], and represents an attractive target
for anticancer therapies [16, 17]. Previous work from
our lab has shown that fusion of SapC-DOPS to cancer
cells led to apoptotic death due to ceramide accumulation
and caspase activation [9, 11, 18]. Recently, we showed
that SapC-DOPS has anti-angiogenic and pro-survival
effects in GBM mouse models [11] and can also target
spontaneous metastases of orthotopically-implanted
pancreatic cancer cells [18].
In this study, we evaluate SapC-DOPS
bioavailability in orthotopic GBM xenografts, assess its
effectiveness against the growth of subcutaneous GBM
xenografts, and address its ability to selectively target
brain metastases of human breast and lung cancer cells
in mice. To determine the kinetics of SapC-DOPS uptake
by GBM cells in vivo, we evaluated its accumulation
for up to 24 hours post-systemic injection. Having
recently proved SapC-DOPS efficacy against orthotopic
U87ΔEGFR GBM tumor xenografts with constitutive
EGFR activation [11], in this report we assessed SapCDOPS’ antitumor actions on non-genetically engineered
U87-MG GBM cell xenografts. Then, using co-cultures of
human astrocytes and human breast cancer cells with brain
metastatic potential, we assessed the binding selectivity of
SapC-DOPS, and characterized its tumor cytotoxicity in
vitro. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of SapC-DOPS
nanovesicles to selectively target and label small brain
metastases derived from human breast and lung primary
cancer cells in mice in vivo, and assess the therapeutic
benefits of SapC-DOPS in mice with brain metastases of
breast cancer cells. Taken together, our findings highlight
the potential of SapC-DOPS nanovesicles in the diagnosis
and therapy of both primary and metastatic CNS cancers.

of GBM-bearing mice [11]. In order to maximize the
diagnostic and therapeutic potential of SapC-DOPS, we
characterized their targeting efficacy and bioavailability
in mice intracranially implanted with human U87ΔEGFRLuc GBM cells. Orthotopic implantation of these cells in
athymic mice produced solid tumors (Fig. 1A and 1B) that
led to significant morbidity and mortality after 12-16 days.
After a single, systemic intravenous (tail vein) injection,
fluorescently labeled SapC-DOPS (SapC-DOPS-CVM)
accumulated selectively in these tumors (Fig. 1A), while
no signal was observed in mice injected with PBS, DOPSCVM, or CVM alone.
The time course of SapC-DOPS-CVM and DOPSCVM accumulation in intracranial GBM xenografts
was determined 30 min, 3 h, and 24h after intravenous
injection. At these time points, mice were sacrificed and
CVM fluorescence (red) was quantitated from confocal
images of brain tissue sections (Fig. 1C). A progressive
accumulation of SapC-DOPS-CVM was observed in
GBM tumors; there was minimal intra-tumor accumulation
of DOPS-CVM, while no signal was observed for either
DOPS-CVM or SapC-DOPS-CVM in the brains of sham
(PBS-injected) animals (Fig. 1D).

SapC-DOPS crosses the blood-brain-tumorbarrier
Aberrant angiogenesis and enhanced vascular
permeability characterize many solid tumors in the brain
as well as in peripheral organs, and may contribute to
the tumor-selective targeting capacity of SapC-DOPS in
our GBM model. We used fluorescently labeled lectin,
dextran and SapC-DOPS to simultaneously assess
vascular structure, vascular permeability and SapC-DOPS
uptake in orthotopic U87ΔEGFR-Luc GBM in mice. As
shown in Fig. 2, in vivo lectin-FITC staining revealed an
enlarged, irregular tumor vasculature, while extravasation
of dextran-TRITC (70 kDa) evidenced its marked
permeability. By 48 hs after intravenous injection, SapCDOPS-CVM extensively and specifically accumulated
within the tumor. Incomplete colocalization of SapCDOPS-CVM and lectin-FITC indicated that SapCDOPS accumulated in the extravascular tumor space,
thus confirming that SapC-DOPS nanovesicles are able
to cross the blood-brain-tumor-barrier, but not the intact
brain endothelium.

glioblastoma in vivo

Next, we assessed the importance of tumor
phosphatidylserine expression on the selective uptake
of SapC-DOPS by GBM in vivo. First, we performed
immunostaining of intracranial U87ΔEGFR-Luc GBMs
with an anti- phosphatidylserine antibody, which revealed

strong tumor immunoreactivity, as compared with that of
cells in the adjacent, normal brain parenchyma (Fig. 3A).
Then, we tested the ability of lactadherin, a protein with
high affinity for phosphatidylserine, to block SapC-DOPS
targeting in vivo. To this end, GBM-bearing mice were
injected intravenously with lactadherin or BSA (10 µg)
30 min before administration of SapC-DOPS-CVM. After
3 hours, ex-vivo brain imaging showed that SapC-DOPSCVM targeting was nearly abolished in the three mice
pretreated with lactadherin (Fig. 3B). Immunofluorescence
staining confirmed that lactadherin localized to tumor

cells and not to the surrounding brain stroma (Fig.
3C). These results suggest that SapC-DOPS binding to
U87ΔEGFR-Luc GBM cells in vivo is mainly determined
by phosphatidylserine exposure in these cells.

SapC-DOPS to significantly prolong the survival of mice

harboring orthotopic U87ΔEGFR-Luc GBM tumors that
expressed the EGFRvIII mutation [11]. Here we sought to
determine whether SapC-DOPS would also be effective
against GBM tumors expressing the wild-type EGFR.
To this end, nude mice were implanted subcutaneously
with U87-MG cells, and when tumors reached ~100 mm3
mice were injected with a saline solution (control) or with

SapC-DOPS (4 mg SapC/kg) daily for 7 days and every
2 days thereafter for 10 days. SapC-DOPS administration
inhibited tumor growth by 56% (Fig. 4, n = 6, P < 0.05)

SapC-DOPS selectively targets human cancer
cells with metastatic potential
After characterizing the targeting efficacy and
bioavailability of SapC-DOPS in a primary brain cancer
(GBM) model, we evaluated its ability both in vitro
and in vivo to target cancer cells with brain metastasis
potential. To this end, we first established an in vitro
co-culture system comprising normal human astrocytes
(HA) and metastatic breast cancer (MDA-MB-231-lucD3H2LN) cells and compared SapC-DOPS uptake in
both cell types after short (30 min) incubation. Fig. 5
illustrates and summarizes SapC-DOPS-CVM uptake
(A; red fluorescence) and quantification data (B) for both
cell types. Binding and uptake of SapC-DOPS-CVM
was significantly higher in cancer cells. In line with the
results presented above, this selectivity is likely to be a
consequence of the elevated phosphatidylserine exposure
levels exhibited by MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN cells,
as compared with those of normal astrocytes (Fig. 5C).
Next, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of SapC-DOPS toward

subcutaneous U87-MG xenografts and tumor size quantified
by caliper measurement during systemic treatment with saline

MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN cells using the MTT cell
viability assay. After 72 hs treatment, the assay revealed
that SapC-DOPS killed tumor cells with an IC50 of 25.2
± 1.5 µM (n = 3).

DOPS’s specific targeting of tumor cells (Fig. 6A, right
side). Brain histology in these mice revealed multifocal
micro- and macrometastases of epithelial morphology
located predominantly in the hippocampal region (Fig.
6B); in some cases, metastatic cells were also found in
the cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. These cells
strongly expressed phosphatidylserine (Fig. 6C) and
evidenced extensive mitosis, as shown by immunostaining
against the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Fig. 6D). Vascular
labeling with lectin-FITC showed that MDA-MB231-luc-D3H2LN tumor cells grow both as compact
clusters, surrounding capillary structures, and also along
preexisting vessels (Fig. 6E).
To better characterize this brain metastasis model,
we performed immunohistochemistry to define potential
tumor-stromal interactions. Brain regions affected with
metastases showed marked astrogliosis as evidenced by
GFAP immunostaining (Fig. 7A). Nestin-expressing host
cells with stellate morphology were also prominently
observed in close proximity to tumor cells (Fig. 7B);

SapC-DOPS targets brain micrometastases of
human breast and lung cancer cells
The ability of SapC-DOPS to target brain metastases
was evaluated in two metastatic brain tumor models,
generated by injecting human breast cancer cells (MDAMB-231-luc-D3H2LN) or human lung cancer cells
(NCI-H460) into the internal carotid artery of nude mice.
Fig. 6A shows an example of the luciferase bioluminescent
signal (Luc) detected 51 days after injection of MDA-MB231-luc-D3H2LN cancer cells in a live mouse, indicating
the presence of tumor cells in the brain. Overlapping

single intravenous injection, was indicative of SapC-

nestin expression sometimes overlapped with vascular
(lectin) stain (not shown), suggesting a possible role of
nestin-positive host cells in tumor vasculogenesis. Tumor
cells were also tightly surrounded by CD11b-expressing
myeloid cells and stained positively for the VEGF receptor
VEGFR1 (Fig. 7C).
By 24 h after SapC-DOPS-CVM injection,
fluorescence microscopy of brain sections showed that
the nanovesicles targeted MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN
micrometastases, especially those exhibiting rich capillary
remodeling (Fig. 8A and B). Extravascular SapC-DOPSCVM signal was also apparent in some metastatic foci
(arrows in Fig. 8A). Interestingly, we noticed that SapCDOPS-CVM signal was conspicuously present nearby
metastatic cell clusters in regions of vascular disruption,
characterized by cell infiltrates that stained positively for
the myeloid marker CD11b (Fig. 8C). As with the GBM
model, SapC-DOPS-CVM fluorescence was absent in the
intact brain parenchyma.
We next assessed the therapeutic effects of SapCDOPS in mice harboring brain metastases. 5 days after
intracarotid injection with MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN
cells, animals (8 per group) received either DOPS or
SapC-DOPS injections (daily for 7 days, then every 2
days for 10 more days). Mice treated with SapC-DOPS
showed significantly extended survival compared with
those treated with DOPS (Figure 8D; n = 8; p < 0.05).
The ability of SapC-DOPS to target metastatic
brain tumors was finally assessed in a second brain
metastasis mouse model generated by intracarotid
injection of NCI-H460 human large cell lung carcinoma
cells. About 3 weeks after tumor cell injection (i.e., when
signs of morbidity appeared) the mice were injected
intravenously with SapC-DOPS-CVM and sacrificed
24 hs later. Similar to our metastatic breast cancer
model, histological examination showed the presence
of discrete micro- and macrometastases preferentially
located in the hippocampus, thalamus, and midbrain (Fig.
9A). Examination of brain sections showed selective
accumulation of SapC-DOPS-CVM in tumor cells (Fig.
9A). Compared with the brain metastases produced by
breast cancer cells (Fig. 6E and 8B), the paucity of lectinFITC signal within brain metastases of lung cancer cells

indicated that these tumors were poorly perfused (Fig.
9B). Similar to the breast cancer metastasis model, lung
cancer metastatic cells expressed phosphatidylserine (Fig.
9B), induced prominent gliosis (Fig. 9C) and were closely
surrounded by CD11b-positive microglia/macrophages
(Fig. 9D). These results indicate that SapC-DOPS CVM
effectively and selectively target small metastases of
human cancer cells in the mouse brain.

DISCUSSION
Selective delivery of anticancer agents remains
a key obstacle in implementing effective therapies for
both primary and secondary, or metastatic, cancers. In
the case of brain tumors, this problem is compounded
by the presence of the blood brain barrier, which limits
the passage of most drugs from the blood to the tumor
stroma. We have shown that SapC-DOPS nanovesicles
target tumor cells and exert antitumor actions both in vitro
and in vivo, in mouse models of human neuroblastoma,
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor [9], squamous
cell carcinoma [19], GBM [11] and pancreatic cancer
[18]. These studies suggested that tumor-selective binding
and cytotoxicity effected by SapC-DOPS correlate with

the ability of SapC to fuse with exposed membrane
phosphatidylserine, which is abundant in many different
cancer cells [14-16].
Bioavailability and antitumor effects of SapC-DOPS
in human glioblastoma mouse models. We previously
reported the antiangiogenic and pro-survival effects of
SapC-DOPS on different mouse GBM models, including
one that expressed EGFRvIII, a constitutively active
EGFR representing the most common mutation found
in EGFR-amplified GBMs [11]. In order to assess SapCDOPS bioavailability after systemic administration,
a critical factor for optimizing potential therapeutic
interventions, in the present study we used the latter
GBM mouse model to characterize the kinetics of SapCDOPS accumulation. After a single intravenous injection,
we observed a time-dependent accumulation of SapCDOPS-CVM in intracranial U87ΔEGFR-Luc GBMs.
In contrast, nanovesicles composed of DOPS-CVM
failed to accumulate in the tumors, and tumor-free brain
parenchyma showed no patent SapC-DOPS or DOPS
uptake. As evidenced by vascular staining with fluorescent
lectin, 24-48 hs after systemic injection SapC-DOPS-CVM

accumulated in the extravascular space of U87ΔEGFRLuc GBMs, indicative of its ability to cross the blood
brain tumor barrier (BBTB). The high permeability of the
tumor vasculature in this model, denoted by the patent
extravasation of fluorescent, 70 kD dextran in the tumor
mass, makes it possible that SapC-DOPS extravasation
is aided by the “enhanced permeability and retention”
effect [20]. However, because DOPS-CVM vesicles were
not effectively taken up by tumor cells, the retention of
SapC-DOPS within the tumor cannot be explained solely
by the increased permeability of the BBTB. Rather,
because systemically injected lactadherin (which binds
phosphatidylserine with very high affinity, v.g. Kd~0.08–4
nM) caused a marked blockade of SapC-DOPS-CVM
targeting of GBM, we conclude that uptake and retention
of SapC-DOPS by GBM cells in vivo is mediated by
surface exposed phosphatidylserine. Taken together,
these results confirm that SapC-DOPS crosses the BBTB
and accumulate specifically in GBM in a PS-dependent
fashion.
Considering GBM genetic heterogeneity, we next
asked whether SapC-DOPS would also be effective

against GBM tumors expressing the wild-type EGFR.
Treatment of mice bearing subcutaneous human U87-MG
xenografts with SapC-DOPS demonstrated significant
tumor burden reduction, suggesting that SapC-DOPS may
be therapeutically effective against GBM tumors with
different genetic backgrounds.
Targeting and cytotoxic effects of SapC-DOPS
on metastatic brain tumor cells. In the second part of
our study, we explored the ability of SapC-DOPS to
target, both in vitro and in vivo, breast cancer cells with
brain metastatic potential. Its targeting efficacy toward
human breast cancer MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN cells
was first evaluated in a co-culture system with normal,
human astrocytes, a model that better resembles the
microenvironment of brain tumors. After short incubation
with fluorescently labeled SapC-DOPS, tumor cells
bound and internalized significantly more SapC-DOPS
than astrocytes. Assessment of PS levels by annexinVFITC staining in these cell types showed that MDA-MB231-luc-D3H2LN cells have ~3 times as much exposed
phosphatidylserine than astrocytes; this finding provides

a plausible mechanism for the observed selectivity of
SapC-DOPS toward the tumor cells. The antitumor
capacity of SapC-DOPS was confirmed through an in
vitro cytotoxicity assay that showed that SapC-DOPS kills
MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN with an IC50 of 25.2 μM.
The capacity of SapC-DOPS to target brain
metastases was then assessed in living mice. Two mouse
models were generated by injecting MDA-MB-231luc-D3H2LN cells, a strain of the MDA-MB-231 breast
carcinoma cell line that has been shown to preferentially
metastasize to the brain after intracardiac injection [21],
or large cell lung carcinoma cells NCI-H460 [22], into the
internal carotid artery of athymic mice [23, 24]. In vivo
MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN tumor luminescence in the
brains was detectable 5-7 weeks after tumor cell injection.
The progression of NCI-H460 tumors was faster, with
animals showing signs of morbidity after 18-21 days.
Using histology and tissue immunofluorescence,
we defined some morphological and molecular aspects of
these metastatic brain cancer models. MDA-MB-231-lucD3H2LN tumors were always multifocal and grew either

alongside small blood vessels (vascular co-option) or as
aggregates encasing dense capillary networks, suggestive
of vascular remodeling. This strict association of tumor
cells with vascular elements has been described in both
animal models and human samples of brain metastases
[22, 25, 26]. In contrast with MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN
tumors, NCI-H460 tumors were typically larger and fewer
in number, had less vascular perfusion, and were not
observed to grow in apposition to blood vessels.
Consistent with observations made in several
human and experimental brain metastases [27-29],
reactive glia, denoted by GFAP staining, surrounded
micro- and macrometastatic clusters in both our models.
Astrocytes have been shown to promote tumorigenesis
by upregulating survival gene expression [30], reducing
tumor-suppressor microRNA levels [31], stimulating
cancer stem-cell proliferation [32], and facilitating the
invasion [33] of metastatic cancer cells. We observed
numerous nestin-expressing host cells in close proximity
to
metastatic
MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN
cell
clusters. Nestin is an intermediate filament expressed
by neuroepithelial progenitor cells and newly formed
endothelial cells and can be re-expressed by mature cells,
such as astrocytes in glial neoplasms, and in response to
brain injury [34-37]. We also show that brain metastases
of MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN cells express the VEGF
receptor VEGFR1. Synthesized by most tumors and
a primary mediator of tumor angiogenesis, VEGF has
been shown to act autocrinally on MDA-MB-231 cells
to promote growth [38, 39]. Moreover, the dependence
on VEGF signaling for cancer progression has been
demonstrated in a preclinical model of metastatic breast
cancer to the brain [40]. The presence of CD11b-positive
microglia/macrophages in close apposition to cancer cells
in our two brain metastasis models reflects a common
feature of brain malignant neoplasms [41]. Although both
anti- and pro-tumoral actions for these tumor-associated
macrophages have been suggested, there is a general
agreement in that they play a permissive role in tumor
growth. For instance, recent studies provided elegant
evidence that microglia, the brain’s resident immune cells,
promote the invasion and colonization of brain tissue by
breast cancer cells [33, 42].
After systemic injection, in vivo imaging showed
that fluorescent SapC-DOPS-CVM nanovesicles
colocalized with the luminescent signal of MDA-MB231-luc-D3H2LN cells in the mouse brain, denoting
selective targeting of metastatic tumor cells. Fluorescence
microscopy of brain sections confirmed selective tumor
targeting by SapC-DOPS in both breast and lung metastatic
brain cancer models. Using immunofluorescence, we
showed that phosphatidylserine expression was abundant
in brain tumor cells in both mouse models; this fact, as
discussed above, likely underlies the selective tumor
targeting of SapC-DOPS. Interestingly, SapC-DOPS-CVM
signal also overlapped with CD11b-positive myeloid cells

in peritumoral regions characterized by hemorrhage and
disrupted vascular integrity. The binding and uptake of
SapC-DOPS by those cells should be favored both by
the phagocytic activity of microglia/macrophages toward
large macromolecules such as liposomes and by their
expression of phosphatidylserine receptor(s). Previous
studies have showed that SapC-DOPS effectively targeted
inflammatory leukocytes in mouse models of arthritis
[43] and affected the cytokine expression profile of
macrophages [44]. In light of the important connection
between inflammation and cancer, and recent reports
indicating that antibody-mediated phosphatidylserine
targeting promotes immune activation in diverse
preclinical cancer models [45, 46], these observations
suggest that SapC-DOPS, either alone or combined with a
variety of drugs and ligands, may be useful to effect direct
tumor cytotoxicity, to steer immune responses against
tumor growth, and to modulate inflammatory reactions.
Finally, the antitumor effectiveness of SapC-DOPS
was evaluated in vivo in our breast cancer metastasis
model, showing that systemic treatment with SapC-DOPS
resulted in extended survival. Our study presents some
limitations. Because metastatic tumors in these mice do
not arise from primary tumors, our models do not represent
true metastases. However, they still recapitulate the
essential steps of the metastatic process; i.e. hematogenous
dissemination, vascular arrest and extravasation, and
tumor cell growth. Importantly, many of the tumor-stromal
relationships described in these models reproduce those
encountered in the histopathological analysis of clinical
specimens. Another limitation is that the study human
tumor biology in preclinical models is so far restricted
to, and conditioned by, the use of immunodeficient nude
mice, and thus the anti-tumoral actions of the adaptive arm
of the immune system are effectively excluded.
In conclusion, we have shown that SapC-DOPS
nanovesicles can effectively target primary and metastatic
brain tumors, and confer a significant survival advantage
in a preclinical model of breast cancer metastasis to the
brain. Systemically delivered SapC-DOPS nanovesicles
are well tolerated and do not induce hepatotoxicity or
manifest adverse effects [9]. We believe that the combined
tumor selectivity and cytotoxic activity exhibited by SapCDOPS equally in vitro and in vivo makes them attractive
candidates for the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture procedures and reagents
Human U87ΔEGFR-Luc glioblastoma cells,
expressing a truncated, constitutively active, mutant
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRvIII) were
obtained from Dr. Webster Cavenee (Ludwig Cancer
7114

Oncotarget

Institute, San Diego, CA). The U87-MG glioblastoma
cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection –ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). Both cell lines
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100U
penicillin/ml, and 100 µg streptomycin/ml. Human breast
carcinoma MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN cells (Caliper
Life Sciences, Mountain View, CA) were grown in Eagle’s
minimum essential medium with 10% FBS and penicillin/
streptomycin (complete MEM). Human large-cell lung
carcinoma cells NCI-H460 (ATCC HTB 177), purchased
from ATCC (Manassas, VA), were cultured in RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Normal human
astrocytes (ScienCell, Carlsbad, CA) were cultured in
poly-L-lysine coated dishes in astrocyte medium (AM)
that contained 2% FBS, growth factors, and antibiotics,
according to instructions provided by the supplier. All cell
lines were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 gas incubator.

USA). Phosphatidylserine levels in cultured cells were
determined by flow cytometry using an AnnexinV-FITC/PI
staining kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according
to the manufacturer instructions. SapC-DOPS cytotoxicity
toward MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN cells was evaluated
using a MTT cell proliferation assay (Roche Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, IN) in cells cultured for 72 h in the presence
of various concentrations of SapC-DOPS (containing 4.5,
9, 22.5, or 45 µg SapC) or equimolar amounts of DOPS.

Brain tumor mouse models and treatment
protocol
All experiments involving mice complied with
National Institutes of Health guidelines. Protocols were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the University of Cincinnati (IACUC
number 11-05-05-02) and the Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital Research Foundation (IACUC number 20130052). Orthotopic GBM xenografts were produced by
stereotactic injection of 1 × 105 U87ΔEGFR-Luc cells
into 8 weeks old, anesthetized female athymic nude
mice (Harlan), 2 mm lateral to bregma, at a depth of 3
mm. Sham-operated animals received a saline injection.
Subcutaneous GBM xenografts were produced by
injecting 1 × 106 U87-MG cells into the dorsal right
flank of 8-10 weeks old female athymic nude mice. Once
the average tumor size reached ~100 mm3, mice (6 per
group) received tail vein injections with a saline solution
(Control) or SapC-DOPS (6mg/kg = SapC 4mg/kg, DOPS
2mg/kg) daily for the first 7 days, and then every 2 days
for 10 days. Tumor size was assessed every 2-3 days by
direct caliper measurement
The brain metastasis mouse models were created by
injecting 1 × 105 MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN cells or 1 ×
105 NCI-H460 cells, in a total volume of 20 µl PBS, into
the left internal carotid artery of female nude mice [23, 24].
To assess the therapeutic effect of SapC-DOPS, starting
five days after intra-carotid injection with MDA-MB-231luc-D3H2LN cells, mice were randomly distributed into 2
groups (8 mice per group) and administered SapC-DOPS
(12mg/kg = SapC 8mg/kg, DOPS 4mg/kg) or DOPS
(4mg/kg) nanovesicles. Injections (200 ul of SapC 0.8 mg/
ml and/or DOPS 0.4 mg/ml in PBS) were given via tail
vein daily for seven days, and then every two days for an
additional ten days.

Fluorescent SapC-DOPS nanovesicle preparation
CellVue Maroon (CVM; Molecular Targeting
Technologies Inc., Exton, PA) in ethanol was mixed
with DOPS and SapC for bath sonication preparation as
described previously [9]. Briefly, 82 µg DOPS (Avanti
Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) were mixed with 30 µl CVM
(from 1 mM stock) in a glass tube and the mix solvent
evaporated under nitrogen gas. Human recombinant SapC
protein [47] (0.4 mg) was added to DOPS-CVM along
with 20 µl citrate/phosphate buffer pH 5.0. After addition
of 1 ml PBS (or DMEM) and a 30 min sonication step,
SapC-DOPS nanovesicles were separated from free CVM
dye using a Sephadex G25 column (PD-10; Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). DOPS-CVM
nanovesicles were prepared as described by omitting
SapC.

In vitro experiments
To establish co-cultures of astrocytes and MDAMB-231-luc-D3H2LN tumor cells, astrocytes (passage
number ≤ 4) were labeled with the PKH67 Green
Fluorescent Cell Linker Kit (Sigma) and plated with tumor
cells in media containing (1:1) AM:complete MEM.
For SapC-DOPS-CVM uptake experiments, cells
were cultured in 12-mm diameter, poly-L-lysine-coated
glass coverslips at a ratio of 1:1 astrocytes:tumor cells.
After 48 hs, co-cultured cells were incubated with
SapC-DOPS-CVM (125 ul; 3.5 uM SapC) in complete
MEM for 30 min at 37oC. Cells were then washed with
PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and mounted in
DAPI-containing aqueous mounting medium. CVM
fluorescence was quantified from microphotographs
(10 per individual culture) using Image J software (U.
S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In vivo bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging
For tumor imaging, mice were anesthetized with
2% isoflurane, and d-Luciferin (Caliper Life Sciences) at
150 mg/kg body weight was injected intraperitoneally 5
min before imaging. SapC-DOPS-CVM or CVM-labeled
DOPS was administered by tail vein injection (200 µl
volume) to mice bearing U87ΔEGFR-Luc or MDA-MB7115

Oncotarget

Statistical analysis

231-luc-D3H2LN brain tumors. Images were taken using
an IVIS 200 Series (Clipper, Alameda, CA) or a Kodak FX
(Carestream Health, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) imaging
system.

GraphPad Prism software was used to compare
Kaplan–Meier curves using the log-rank test. SapCDOPS-CVM uptake in cultured cells and in vivo tumor
growth were analyzed using two-tailed, unpaired Student’s
t tests. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically
significant. All error bars represent standard error (SE).

Vascular staining and permeability, lactadherin
administration, and CVM quantification
Staining of mouse brain vasculature was done
by injecting 100 µg of tomato lectin-FITC (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) into the tail vein 2 min
before sacrifice. To assess vascular permeability, mice
were similarly injected with 1 mg TRITC-dextran 70,000
MW (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) 30 min before
sacrifice. Bovine lactadherin (Haematologic Technologies,
Inc, Essex Junction, VT) was injected intravenously (10
µg) in saline. Dissected brains were frozen in dry ice
and stored at -80 ºC. After embedding in OCT freezing
medium, cryosections (25 µm) were mounted in glass
slides using DAPI-containing medium. Images were
obtained in a confocal fluorescence microscope (LSM
710; Carl Zeiss) using appropriate filters. Brain CVM
fluorescence was registered by exciting at 633 nm.
Quantification of CVM-labeled SapC-DOPS or DOPS
signal in mouse GBM sections was performed using
ZenLite software (Carl Zeiss).
