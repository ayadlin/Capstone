Abstract

Author Manuscript

In light of a detailed characterization of genetic aberrations in cancer, nucleic acid targeting
represents an attractive therapeutic approach with significant translational potential. Head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide with
stagnant 5-year survival rates. Advances in conventional treatment have done little to improve
survival and combined chemoradiation is associated with significant adverse effects. Recent
reports have characterized the genetic alterations in HNSCC and demonstrated that mutations
confer resistance to conventional and molecular targeted therapies. The ability to use specific
nucleic acid sequences to inhibit cancer-associated genes including non-druggable targets
facilitates personalized medicine approaches with less adverse effects. Additionally, advances in
drug delivery mechanisms have increased the transfection efficiency aiding in greater therapeutic
responses. Given these advances, the stage has been set to translate the information garnered from
genomic studies into personalized treatment strategies. Genes involved in the tumor protein 53
(TP53) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways have been extensively investigated
and many promising preclinical studies have shown tumor inhibition through genetic modulation.
We, and others, have demonstrated that targeting oncogene expression with gene therapy
approaches is feasible in patients. Other methods such as RNA interference have proven to be
effective and are potential candidates for clinical studies. This review summarizes the major
advances in sequence-specific gene modulation in the preclinical setting and in clinical trials in
head and neck cancer patients.

Introduction
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality worldwide and is primarily associated with tobacco and alcohol use.1 Due to late
clinical presentation and advanced stage, HNSCC leads to over 300 000 deaths annually.
Most patients require extensive, multidisciplinary treatment. However, even with aggressive
treatment, the five-year survival rate in the United States is only around 40% primarily due
to the lack of effective therapeutic options for advanced-staged cancers. 2

Author Manuscript

In patients with locally advanced disease, relapse is common despite early therapeutic
intervention. In these patients, prognosis is poor and conventional treatment yields only 30%
to 40% response rates with a median survival between 6 and 9 months.3 Traditional
chemotherapy has low tumor specificity leading to significant adverse effects in patients.
Further, a wide array of gene aberrations in HNSCC are implicated in therapeutic failure to
conventional therapy.4 While some mutations are etiologic, others confer sensitivity or
resistance to chemotherapy.5-7

Author Manuscript

Expression of the variant III form of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR vIII) confers
resistance to EGFR inhibitors and may explain the modest clinical response with these
agents.8-10 Conversely, nearly one third of HNSCC tumors harbor mutations in PI3KCA
gene.11 The oncogenic PIK3CA (E542K) mutation confers exquisite sensitivity to PI3K
pathway inhibitor BEZ-325.12 Given the heterogeneity in mutations, it would be difficult to
develop small molecules or antibodies that specifically target each oncogenic
mutation.11, 13, 14 In this scenario, the use of targeted nucleic acid therapy to mitigate
expression of mutated genes with high sequence specificity would facilitate personalized
cancer therapy and combat treatment failures. In this manuscript, we discuss advances in
gene delivery systems, and preclinical and clinical studies using nucleic acid targeted
therapy for HNSCC.

Gene Delivery Systems

Author Manuscript

Direct intratumoral administration of therapeutic nucleic acids for proof-of-concept studies
is feasible in easily accessible sites such as the oral cavity. However, difficulty in accessing
deep-seated tumors, low transfection efficiency, and susceptibility to nuclease degradation
are major limitations with injection of naked DNA or RNA.15 In order to facilitate systemic
delivery and improve transfection efficiency, significant advances have occurred in vector
development including liposomes, nanoparticles, and viral vectors (Figure 1). Liposome
complexes protect nucleic acids from degradation and improve uptake in cells. A spherical
lipid bilayer encapsulating the nucleic acid cargo fuses with the plasma membrane of cells,
releasing the contents into the cytoplasm. In vitro studies show a transfection efficacy of up
to 70%, however the presence of serum components can decrease this by 35% to 45%.16
Despite the increase inefficacy, hematologic toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and innate immune
responses have been associated with systemic therapy.17-19 In order to reduce toxicity and
facilitate tumor specificity, next-generation liposomes carry tumor-targeted peptides in the
lipid bilayer. For instance, liposomes conjugated to the transferrin ligand have a higher
affinity for HNSCC cells with upregulated transferrin receptors than non-malignant cells. In

vitro results suggests an increase in transfection efficiency from 10% to 50% when using
transferrin ligand attachments.20 Alternatively, the use of anti-transferrin receptor singlechain antibody on the surface of cationic liposomes can increase specific uptake in tumor
cells on systemic administration.21 The major challenge that persists with liposomes is
hepatotoxicity upon clearance from circulation.

In an effort to decrease toxicity and increase transfection efficiency, other methods of gene
delivery have been developed. Synthetic polymer-nucleotide complexes can diffuse across
the plasma membrane or enter cells through endocytosis. Nucleotides dissociate from the
polymer and exert their action within the cytoplasm or the nucleus. Common polymers used
in HNSCC include polyethylenimine (PEI) and glucosylated PEIs.22-24 A challenge to the
widespread use of these agents is the formation of complexes with blood components due to
the high cationic charge.25 Conjugation with hydrophilic polymers reduces this positive
charge, increasing bioavailability. In vitro gene transfection efficiency can reach up to 47%
while retaining in vivo antitumor efficacy.26 Another novel mechanism for delivery involves
systemically administered, ultrasound-guided microbubbles targeting HNSCC tumors.
Vigorous mixing of aqueous solutions of lipid and nucleic acid generates microbubbles with
a lipid shell and perfluorobutane gas interior. The average diameter of the microbubbles is 1
to 8 μm. Intravenously administered microbubbles are visualized using ultrasound imaging.
As they perfuse the tumor, destruction of microbubbles with high frequency ultrasound
waves releases the nucleic acid cargo near tumor cells. Several preclinical studies
demonstrated successful microbubble-mediated transfer of nucleic acid to the tumor
site.27-29 Cellular uptake of nucleic acids is facilitated by lipids in the shell, and by the
acoustic frequency and force of cavitation of microbubbles.30 In comparison to direct
inoculation of tumors with antineoplastic agents or nucleic acids, this technique shows
greater delivery efficiency and cellular uptake in in vivo models with HNSCC tumors.31, 32
However, the use of microbubbles is limited to tumors that can be easily visualized using
ultrasound imaging.

Significant advances in molecular engineering of viruses enable highly efficient transfer of
transgenes into tumors. Adenoviruses and retroviruses are the two main classes of viral
vectors tested in HNSCC. Adenoviruses are DNA viruses that infect both dividing and nondividing cells. Exogenous DNA remains episomal without integrating into the genome. In
contrast, retroviruses primarily infect actively dividing cells and stably integrate transgenes
into the host genomic DNA with high efficiency. In addition to high efficiency of gene
transfer, cell lysis during viral replication potentiates the therapeutic benefit of viruses.
Wild-type adenoviruses have a low transfection efficiency,33 however modifications to the
viral genome or surface structure have been employed to increase effectiveness.34 In order to
increase tumor specificity, oncolytic viruses are biochemically modified to target and
replicate only within tumor cells or in cells expressing specific genes. In the following
sections, we describe the use of gene delivery vectors in preclinical and clinical studies using
nucleic acid-based therapy approaches in HNSCC.

DNA-Based Approaches
There are over 1 000 cancer clinical trials testing gene therapy approaches in various
cancers. In the following sections, we describe preclinical and clinical studies utilizing gene
therapy for treatment of HNSCC.
Plasmid DNA

Author Manuscript

Preclinical studies—Plasmid expression vectors that knockdown oncogenes or restore
tumor suppressor genes demonstrate antitumor efficacy in HNSCC preclinical models.
Liposome-encapsulated antisense plasmid DNA reduced EGFR mRNA levels and inhibited
HNSCC tumor growth35 and angiogenesis when used in combination with antiangiogenic
agent, endostatin.36 The formulation was safe in animal models despite long-term
persistence of exogenous plasmid DNA in plasma and organs distant from the injection
site.37, 38 Plasmid expression vector-mediated restoration of tumor suppressor p53 levels in
HNSCC cell lines activated pro-apoptotic proteins, promoting tumor death and increased
radiosensitivity.20, 21 Immune-mediated antitumor effects are observed when human IL-2and IL-27-encoding plasmid were transfected into HNSCC tumors.39, 40 In another
approach, toxin-conjugated IL-13 demonstrated specific tumor cell kill in cells transfected
with exogenous interleukin-13 receptor α2.41 Although, plasmid expression vectors
demonstrate feasibility, systemic delivery continues to be a major challenge in the
widespread use of this approach.

Author Manuscript

Human trials—The majority of HNSCC clinical trials report use of plasmid expression
vectors injected intratumorally using cationic liposomes (Table 1). A phase I clinical trial
assessing the intratumoral injection of naked plasmid DNA with an antisense sequence
targeting EGFR, demonstrated a clinical response in 29% of patients, well above the
response rate seen with other EGFR inhibiting agents.42 The highest dose administered (1
920 μg DNA) was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicities. Similar efficacy and safety
profiles have been demonstrated with intratumoral injection of naked heat shock protein 65
(Hsp65) DNA.43 Hsp65 DNA produced a partial response in four of 14 HNSCC patients
with minimal adverse effects. Although there is evidence of efficacy in both these clinical
trials, tumors inaccessible for direct injection continued to grow.42 In order to protect DNA
from serum nucleases and improve cellular uptake, several trials have tested cationic
liposomes as carriers for gene delivery.

Author Manuscript

Intratumoral injection of cationic liposomes carrying plasmid DNA encoding E1A, an
adenoviral gene with antineoplastic activity, in HNSCC tumors was well tolerated,
demonstrated transgene expression and moderate tumor response with one of 24 patients
experiencing complete remission.44 Allovectin-7, a DNA-lipid complex containing human
leukocyte antigen B7 (HLA-B7)-encoding plasmids, has shown modest clinical response and
minimal toxicity with intratumoral injection.45, 46 HLA-B7 is a major histocompatibility
complex class I antigen that elicits a broad antitumor immune response. Although results
from phase II trials were encouraging, failure to meet key endpoints in a subsequent trial
resulted in the discontinuation of Allovectin-7. Thus, although the proof-of-concept

demonstrating antitumor efficacy by plasmid DNA expression vectors is established, the
major limitation of susceptibility to serum nucleases remains.
Oligonucleotides
Oligonucleotides are short, single-stranded, 15 to 20-base sequences that bind
complementary mRNA inhibiting translation primarily through RNase H-mediated
degradation. Ideally, the complementary sequence needs to be unique to facilitate specific
target modulation. Frequently oncogenic mutations differ from wild-type sequences by a few
bases. Development of oligonucleotide chemistries such that mismatch of even a single base
pair would abrogate binding of antisense oligonucleotide to its target would be ideal for
cancer therapeutics and personalized medicine.

Author Manuscript

Preclinical studies—Antisense DNA oligonucleotides (ASO) targeting EGFR
demonstrate antitumor efficacy in HNSCC on intratumoral administration.47 Further, the
observed effects were sequence specific with lack of antitumor effects in control (sense)
oligonucleotide treated tumors. Substitution of nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate (PTO)
groups to alternate bases on the DNA backbone, increases the serum half-life from
approximately 5 min to up to 60 min.48 PTO-modified EGFR ASO potentiated the effects of
docetaxel in HNSCC xenografts on systemic administration.49, 50 However, the antitumor
effects were modest given the relatively short serum half-life.

Author Manuscript

In order to increase the serum stability of ASOs, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) were
developed.51 These are nucleotide analogues containing N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine units in
place of the sugar phosphodiester backbone. Despite longer serum half-lives, there is low
cellular uptake due to the neutral charge of the backbone. In order to improve intracellular
uptake, positively charged guanidinium residues were covalently linked to the PNA
backbone (Figure 3). Uptake of guanidinium peptide nucleic acid (GPNA) oligomers was
detected in tumors up to 4 h after systemic administration.49 GPNA designed to target EGFR
has demonstrated sequence specific target reduction and cytotoxicity in HNSCC cells.
Further, the antitumor effects observed are comparable to that of clinically relevant EGFR
inhibitors. Changes in the position of the guanidinium group on the PNA backbone
facilitated the development of GPNA that are conformationally preorganized into right
handed helices with higher target binding affinity and sequence specificity than earlier
versions.52 This increased oligonucleotide serum stability makes systemic delivery of
specific nucleic acid sequences for cancer therapy a possibility.

Author Manuscript

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a transcription factor that is
upregulated in HNSCC and facilitates tumor progression by binding to specific promoter
sequences of several tumorigenic genes. Leong and colleagues developed a double-stranded
DNA oligonucleotide based on the STAT3-high serum inducible element (HSIE) promoter
sequence.53 The STAT3 decoy sequestered activated STAT3, preventing binding to the
promoter of target genes.54 When tested as monotherapy or in combination with erlotinib,
STAT3 decoy has anti-angiogenic and antitumor effects in xenograft tumors.55, 56 In another
study, guanine-rich oligonucleotides with the HSIE element, formed G-quartet DNA
structures with potent affinity for activated STAT3.57 Further, intraperitoneal injections of

PEI copolymers complexed to G-quartet oligomers, induced antitumor effects in HNSCC
xenografts. More recently, a third-generation ASO targeting Hsp27 was designed using
locked nucleic acid (LNA) technology modified with a ribose oxymethylene bridge to
prevent serum degradation.58 Intraperitoneal injection of Hsp27 LNA led to increased
radiosensitivity in HNSCC xenografts through dysregulation of DNA double-stranded break
repair mechanisms.

Author Manuscript

Human trials—Clinical trials testing oligonucleotides in HNSCC treatment are in their
infancy. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e (eIF-4E) binds the 5’ cap structure of
cellular mRNA and is associated with tumor progression.59 Intravenous administration of
PTO ASOs with flanking methoxyethyl groups targeting eIF-4E-(LY2275796) was tested for
toxicity in a phase I trial for multiple cancers including HNSCC.60 One patient experienced
grade 2 fatigue at the maximum dose tier of 1 200 mg. The study defined the maximum
tolerated dose as 1 000 mg administered intravenously as a loading dose over 3 days
followed by a weekly maintenance dose. Although a lower level of eIF-4E in the tumor
indicated a biological response, there were no clinical responses achieved. Pharmacokinetic
evaluation revealed the majority of ASOs distributed in tissues within 24 h of administration.
The modifications to the nucleic acid backbone increased the terminal elimination phase
half-life to 15 days (4% overall plasma exposure). To improve clinical responses, selection
of patients with high tumor levels of eIF-4E or combined treatment with chemotherapy may
be necessary.

Author Manuscript

The biological response of STAT3 decoy was tested in a phase 0, intraoperative trial.61
Pharmacodynamic studies on intratumoral injection of STAT3 decoy oligomers at three
doses, revealed modulation of STAT3 target genes within 4 h of administration. There were
no adverse effects reported. Although the results in human studies are limited, these early
trials support proof-of-concept that oligonucleotides can be safe and are effective in
modulating target gene levels in HNSCC.

RNA-based Approaches
The regulation of translation by small RNA is an evolutionary conserved process. Molecular
machinery process double stranded non-coding RNA into single stranded fragments that
bind to specific target sequences inhibiting mRNA translation. Initial studies primarily
focused on use of RNA interference (RNAi) for knockdown of gene expression in order to
determine the role of specific genes or pathways in tumorigenesis. However, the specificity
and efficiency of target inhibition, has made this an attractive therapeutic modality for
cancer.

Author Manuscript

The most wildly used classes of RNAi for translational repression of single genes in
HNSCC, are small interfering RNA (siRNA) and short hairpin RNA (shRNA). The main
difference between siRNA and shRNA is that siRNA regulate gene expression transiently
(knockdown-duration less than 2 weeks) while shRNA vectors are expressed after genomic
integration.62 Within the cell, molecular machinery process shRNA and siRNA to generate
single stranded RNA fragments that bind complementary sequences on mRNA, leading to
their degradation. Multiple cancer-associated genes can be simultaneously downregulated by

microRNA (miRNA). The extent of homology of miRNA to its target dictates the
mechanism of translation repression with highly homologous binding triggering target
mRNA cleavage. Partial complementarity would inhibit translation of non-target mRNA
through several mechanisms including inhibition of translation initiation (interfering with
ribosome recruitment) and deacetylation of mRNA.63 Similar to miRNA, several reports
demonstrate non-specific modulation of cellular mRNA by siRNA with partial sequence
homology to the target indicating that siRNA may have off-target effects.64-66 Nevertheless,
a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of translation inhibition could result in improved
specificity of RNAi approaches. Here we discuss use of these approaches in HNSCC
preclinical models.
Small Interfering RNA

Several reports describe siRNA modulation of target genes reduced HNSCC invasion,
proliferation, metastatic dissemination and enhanced response to therapy (Table 2). Invasion
and motility of HNSCC cell lines was significantly decreased using protein kinase Cε
(PKCε) siRNA.67 Further, the use of hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and aurora A
kinase (AURKA) siRNA induced apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation.68, 69 Other factors
have also been the target of treatment, notably the NF-κB family of proteins, which control
gene expression in response to several stimuli including cytokines, growth factors, and
infection. NF-κB is an important target in HNSCC due to its implication in tumor growth
and survival.70 It is constitutively expressed in HNSCC and contributes to cisplatin
resistance by preventing chromatin condensation through histone acetylation.71 When used
in combination with histone deacetylase inhibitors, systemic administration of siRNA
targeting NF-κB p65 (RelA), increased antitumor efficacy of cisplatin.72 Further, in
combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, NF-κB siRNA reduced tumor
growth.73

Author Manuscript

EGFR-targeted siRNA showed a 90% reduction in EGFR expression in vitro and enhanced
sensitivity to cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and docetaxel.74 To facilitate systemic administration,
siRNAs conjugated to nanoparticles were tested in preclinical models of metastatic HNSCC.
Ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2)-targeted siRNA conjugated to nanoparticles
produced apoptosis in metastatic models on systemic delivery.75 In a recent report, calcium
phosphate-based nanoparticles with a hollow lipid-coated core and outer shell, conjugated to
anisamide ligands successfully delivered HIF1α siRNA to sigma receptor expressing
HNSCC cells on intravenous administration.76 In combination with a photosensitizer
photosan, HIF1α siRNA potentiated the effects of photodynamic therapy in xenograft
tumors. This study represents a significant advance in siRNA-mediated gene regulation as a
therapeutic approach. However, addressing challenges associated with siRNA therapy
including off-target effects, inflammation, and non-specific cytotoxicity would make this
approach more feasible for therapeutic use.77 While siRNA has not been used in human
trials, repression of target protein expression using siRNA has been achieved in vitro, and in
vivo studies have demonstrated biologic activity. These results suggest feasibility for their
use with reasonable transfection efficiency and significant biological response.

Short Hairpin RNA

Author Manuscript

Transfection or viral transduction of shRNA expression vectors results in integration into
genomic DNA and RNA polymerase III-mediated transcription.78 The double stranded RNA
fragments are transcribed in the nucleus with a short hairpin sequence at one end and
transported into the cytoplasm where they follow the same molecular processing as
siRNA.62 Several reports on HNSCC cells expressing target-specific shRNA describe the
molecular mechanisms regulating tumor progression and response to therapy.

Author Manuscript

Reports on shRNA-mediated inhibition of several proteins including CD74 and the SET
(suppressor of variegation, enhancer of zeste, and trithorax) oncogene demonstrate antiproliferative effects in HNSCC.79-81 Further, local invasion can be controlled by targeting
extracellular matrix modulators including metalloproteinase-9 and -11.79, 82 While
monotherapy has been efficacious in preclinical models, combination therapy may have
synergistic effects. The use of three shRNAs targeting telomerase reverse transcriptase
(TERT), proangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and antiapoptotic BclXL genes decreased HNSCC xenograft growth, demonstrating the feasibility of a
multitarget-approach.83

Author Manuscript

Several reports demonstrate the role of oncogenes and oncogenic-mutations in resistance to
therapy. Cisplatin therapy is a vital component of current chemotherapy for HNSCC.
However, patients frequently develop resistance to cisplatin. Recent studies have shown that
shRNA-mediated downregulation of glucose transporter GLUT1 and cell cycle regulator
cyclin-D1 increase sensitivity to cisplatin.84-86 Additionally, targeting sphingosine kinase 1
(SPHK1) increased tumor sensitivity to doxorubicin with a significant reduction in SPHK1
expression after transfection.84 Similarly, the use of shRNA targeting mutant-tumor
suppressor p53 conferred sensitivity to radiation in radio-resistant HNSCC.5 Although these
studies are in preclinical development, developments in vectors including viral vectors
would facilitate translation to the clinic. Together these studies provide insight into future
applications for therapeutic gene targeting in HNSCC.

Viral Methods

Author Manuscript

Viruses are effective transgene delivery agents in treatment of many disease processes
ranging from metabolic disturbances to cancer. Of the several classes of viruses used to
deliver transgenes, several reports use adenoviruses and herpesviruses in HNSCC preclinical
models. While viruses are effective vectors for delivery of genetic material, their lytic
lifecycles confer the added advantage of tumor cell destruction. In this section, we discuss
the use of viruses for gene delivery in HNSCC and advances in oncolytic viruses for targeted
destruction of cancer cells.
Viral Vectors
Viruses are frequently used to transduce human cells due to their high efficiency of gene
transfer. Depending on the type of virus, the exogenous nucleic acid either integrates into the
host genome or remains episomal. Viruses used for gene transfer are generally replicationincompetent though there are exceptions.

Preclinical studies—Adenoviral vectors are the most widely used viral vectors for
gene transfer in in preclinical studies and clinical trials. Wild-type p53 delivered using
recombinant adenoviruses, lead to apoptosis in HNSCC tumor cells with up to 60% response
in 48 h.87, 88 This allows for reestablishment of the G1 block, increasing sensitivity to
radiation and chemotherapy.89-91 Further, adenoviruses and adeno-associated viruses were
used to deliver herpes thymidine kinase to tumor explants.92-94 Treatment with prodrug
ganciclovir not only killed the transduced cells but also the adjacent bystander cells. In a
recent study, recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the oncogene erbB2 was tested in a
vaccination approach in a mouse model of salivary gland carcinoma.95 Activation of
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity on intratumoral injection of the recombinant virus
resulted in antitumor efficacy.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Human trials—Clinical trials have primarily focused on the use of adenoviruses for
treatment of HNSCC (Table 3). Gene therapy using adenoviruses encoding wild-type p53
(Ad-p53) was tested in phase I human trials. In patients with incurable recurrent HNSCC, no
dose limiting toxicities or significant adverse events were observed using a single
preoperative intratumoral injection of 1011 plaque forming units (pfu). Additionally there
was a modest response in a number of patients with non-resectable tumors and one patient
with resectable cancer showed complete response. Furthermore, there was an increase in
survival rate by approximately 60% of individuals treated with combination Ad-p53 and
chemotherapy.91 A small-scale phase II trial assessing the efficacy of Ad-p53 in patients
with resectable cancer demonstrated increased disease-free survival rates one year after
resection.96 The study enrolled thirteen patients who received direct injection of 1012 viral
particles (vp) into the surgical margins intraoperatively and postoperatively via catheter
instillation. There were minimal adverse events and 92% of patients were disease free after
one year. Increased survival and improved response rates were reported in phase III clinical
trials as well. The intra-arterial administration of combination Ad-p53 and chemotherapy
improved survivability in patients with stage 3 HNSCC.97 Response rates significantly
increased in comparison to treatment with methotrexate for patients with either wild-type
p53 or low-level expression of mutated p53.98 Ad-p53 vectors are currently being tested in
phase IV clinical trials.
Oncolytic Viruses
Oncolytic viruses preferentially replicate in and lyse tumor cells that express or lack specific
targetable genes. In theory, these agents lead to tumor destruction with minimal bystander
damage. Newer generation oncolytic viruses carry exogenous genes that elicit antitumor
effects or sensitize tumors to therapy.

Author Manuscript

Preclinical studies—Modified herpes simplex viral (HSV) and adenoviral vectors can
carry up to 50 Kb of DNA transgene, and can preferentially replicate in and lyse tumor cells.
Several HSV-based viral vectors were tested in preclinical models of HNSCC. HF10,
HSV1716 and G207 vectors shows anti-tumor efficacy alone or with concomitant cisplatin
in HNSCC preclinical models.99-101 Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed biologic
activity and destruction of all tumor cell lines. Further, mice with HNSCC xenografts had a
statistically significant increase in survivability at 100 d.100 The ONYX class of viruses are

E1B-gene-deleted adenoviruses that selectively replicate within cells lacking wild-type
tumor suppressor p53 and have demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo.102
Intravenous injection of ONYX-015 leads to tumor localization and produces antitumor
effects in nude mice bearing xenograft tumors with a viral replication reported in 100% of
tumors. Furthermore, there was a reduction in tumor growth up to 50% though no
appreciable effect on the growth of distant established tumors was observed.103 The main
obstacle to HSV and adenoviral vectors lie in the endemic nature of the viruses with more
than 70% of the population having a pre-existing immune response that specifically
inactivates viral particles and cells that express viral proteins.104 Preclinical studies with
other classes of oncolytic viruses are underway.

Author Manuscript

In order to facilitate antitumor immune-mediated tumor kill, a fusogenic vesicular stomatitis
virus encoding murine IL-12 was developed that lysed HNSCC more effectively than virus
lacking the transgene leading to significantly increased survival of mice.105 Another study
with measles virus engineered to replace the viral attachment protein with a single-chain
antibody targeting EGFR demonstrated increased tumor specificity.106 In addition, the virus
carried the cytosine deaminase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (CD/UPRT) gene. CD/
UPRT converts prodrug 5-fluorocytosine to 5-fluorouracil, which can diffuse from dying
cells, significantly increasing antitumor effects in non-infected bystander replicating tumor
cells. HNSCC xenograft tumors responded well to intratumoral injections of the
recombinant viral particles followed by prodrug treatment. These studies demonstrate
efficacy of transgene expression by oncolytic viruses for added therapeutic benefit.

Author Manuscript

Human trials—Multiple human trials using oncolytic viruses have shown biologic or
clinical response (Table 3). Intratumoral injection into subcutaneous nodules of a
conditionally replication-competent HSV vector called HF10 in 2 patients with metastatic
HNSCC demonstrated antitumor response with minimal adverse effects.101 Although
preoperative intratumoral injection of 105 pfu of another HSV vector, HSV1761, was well
tolerated with no serious adverse effects, there was no biological effect of therapy.107
ONYX-015 has demonstrated safety with injection of 1011 pfu.108 Stable disease and
modest antitumor activity was achieved with intratumoral administration of ONYX-015. In a
small-scale trial of nine patients, 1010 pfu of ONYX-015 was administered intratumorally
with systemic cisplatin and 5-FU leading to complete or partial regression in all subjects. 109
The study was expanded to a larger phase II trial that reported 63% of individuals with
regression.110 The commercial version of ONYX-015 (ONYX-H101) has been tested in
humans and is approved for human use in China.111

Significant advances in the development of oncolytic viruses have enabled the expression of
transgenes that trigger antitumor responses in addition to cell lysis. The granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) recruits and activates leukocytes including
neutrophils and monocytes to elicit potent antitumor effects. GM-CSF was the first cytokine
incorporated into an oncolytic virus in order to harness the both immune and virus-mediated
tumor cell kill. OncoVEXGM-CSF is a modified HSV-1 encoding GM-CSF tested in several
clinical trials.112-114 In a phase I/II trial, intratumoral injections of OncoVEXGM-CSF in
combination with chemoradiotherapy demonstrated a pathologic complete response rate of
93% (N=17) in late stage HNSCC.115 Pharmacodynamic analyses demonstrated virus

replication in injected and uninjected tumors. This study is the first to demonstrate the
efficacy of using transgene-expressing oncolytic viruses in combination and standard
curative therapy.

Author Manuscript

In another study, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) an immune system stimulator,
chemotherapy and radiation sensitizer expressed by an oncolytic virus was tested for
antitumor effects in recurrent previously treated HNSCC patients. AdGV.EGR.TNF.11D
(TNFerade™ Biologic) is a replication-deficient adenovirus encoding TNF-α under the
control of radiation-inducible Egr-1 promoter.116 Dose limiting toxicity in 3 of 14 patients
experiencing thrombotic events on intratumoral injections of TNFerade™ Biologic at a
maximum dose of 4×1011 pfu combined with chemoradiotherapy helped establish the
maximum tolerated dose.117 Although phase I trials are not designed to assess efficacy, the
response rate of 83%, with one patient surviving for 3 years underscores the therapeutic
potential of this approach. Further developments facilitating systemic administration and
tumor-specific targeting would facilitate the use of oncolytic viruses in the treatment of
inaccessible metastatic disease.

Conclusions

Author Manuscript

HNSCC remains a major cause of mortality despite advances in treatment. As more
therapeutic targets are identified through cancer genome sequencing studies, nucleic acid
targeted therapy has the potential to decrease mortality, increase survival rates, and improve
quality of life in patients with HNSCC. The field of nucleic acid targeting is rapidly
advancing with new avenues of treatment unfolding. A variety of delivery techniques have
been employed for multiple therapy modalities with positive results in both preclinical
studies and human trials. Most methods of nucleic acid delivery have been safe in human
trials with reduction in target gene expression and evidence of antitumor efficacy.
While there have been clinical trials assessing safety and efficacy of viral vectors, less
clinical data is available for the use of antisense oligonucleotides and RNAi methods. The
development of oligonucleotides that target specific gene mutations within a given tumor
could provide a patient-centered approach to therapy. At the very least, nucleic acid targeting
has a crucial role in adjunct treatment for HNSCC.

Figure 1. Summary of the delivery vectors primarily tested for nucleic acid therapy in HNSCC

Author Manuscript

Naked DNA in the form of plasmids or oligonucleotides can freely diffuse across the plasma
membrane and may enter the nucleus for expression. Microbubbles carrying nucleic acids
ruptured at the tumor site by ultrasound, release nucleic acids cargo that diffuses into tumor
cells. Liposomes with or without targeted peptides fuse with the plasma membrane and
deliver cargo into the cell. Polymer vehicles diffuse across the plasma membrane and release
the payload into the nucleus or cytoplasm. Viral vectors can efficiently deliver exogenous
nucleic acids into tumor cells. Oncolytic viruses specifically replicate and lyse target tumor
cells.

Figure 2. Summary of the methods used for targeting gene expression in the treatment of
HNSCC

Author Manuscript

Exogenous plasmid or viral DNA can stably integrate into the genomic DNA or exist as an
episome within the nucleus. RNA polymerases (RNA pol) transcribe the foreign DNA into
RNA fragments. Antisense RNA binds to target mRNA in the cytoplasm inhibiting
transcription. RNAi-mediated translation inhibition is achieved after processing of double
stranded shRNA, siRNA, or miRNA precursor molecules by molecular machinery. Precursor
miRNA, are processed in the nucleus and subsequently exported into the cytoplasm. Dicer
cleaves shRNA, siRNA, and miRNA precursors into 21-25 base oligomers that are loaded
onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading complex, which consist of Dicer,
argonaute (Ago), and a dsRNA-binding protein. The guide strand (blue) binds
complementary mRNA while the passenger strand is discarded. Perfect homology with the
guide strand triggers target mRNA cleavage. Mismatch in a few bases results in translational
repression through inhibition of ribosomal function.

Figure 3. Chemical modifications of oligonucleotide backbones

Author Manuscript

Phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides (PTO) are formed by creating phosphorothioate
bonds through the substitution of a sulfur atom for a non-bridging oxygen in the phosphate
backbone. Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) are DNA analogues with backbones consisting of
N-(2-aminoethyl)-glycine units linked by peptide bonds. The addition of a positively
charged guanidinium group to the PNA backbone (GPNA) facilitates oligomer uptake across
cell membranes.
