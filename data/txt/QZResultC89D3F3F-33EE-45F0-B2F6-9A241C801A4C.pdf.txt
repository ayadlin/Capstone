Abstract
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identiﬁed more than a dozen loci associated with
colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Here, we examined potential effect-modiﬁcation between single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP) at 10 of these loci and probable or established environmental risk factors for CRC in
7,016 CRC cases and 9,723 controls from nine cohort and case–control studies. We used meta-analysis of an
efﬁcient empirical-Bayes estimator to detect potential multiplicative interactions between each of the SNPs
[rs16892766 at 8q23.3 (EIF3H/UTP23), rs6983267 at 8q24 (MYC), rs10795668 at 10p14 (FLJ3802842), rs3802842
at 11q23 (LOC120376), rs4444235 at 14q22.2 (BMP4), rs4779584 at 15q13 (GREM1), rs9929218 at 16q22.1
(CDH1), rs4939827 at 18q21 (SMAD7), rs10411210 at 19q13.1 (RHPN2), and rs961253 at 20p12.3 (BMP2)] and
select major CRC risk factors (sex, body mass index, height, smoking status, aspirin/nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drug use, alcohol use, and dietary intake of calcium, folate, red meat, processed meat,
vegetables, fruit, and ﬁber). The strongest statistical evidence for a gene–environment interaction across
studies was for vegetable consumption and rs16892766, located on chromosome 8q23.3, near the EIF3H and
UTP23 genes (nominal Pinteraction ¼ 1.3  104; adjusted P ¼ 0.02). The magnitude of the main effect of the
SNP increased with increasing levels of vegetable consumption. No other interactions were statistically
signiﬁcant after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Overall, the association of most CRC susceptibility loci
identiﬁed in initial GWAS seems to be invariant to the other risk factors considered; however, our results
suggest potential modiﬁcation of the rs16892766 effect by vegetable consumption. Cancer Res; 72(8); 2036–44.

Gene–Environment Interactions for Colorectal Cancer Risk Loci

Introduction

[sex, body mass index (BMI), height, smoking status, aspirin/
nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAID) use, and intake
of alcohol, dietary calcium, dietary folate, red meat, processed
meat, vegetables, fruit, and ﬁber] in a combined analysis of 9
case–control and nested case–control studies comprising
7,016 CRC cases and 9,723 controls.

Approximately one third of colorectal cancer (CRC), the
second leading cancer in the United States, is attributable to
inherited factors (1). Identiﬁcation of associated genetic variants may elucidate mechanisms underlying this disease. First,
results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have
shown considerable success in identifying genetic variants
associated with CRC (2–10). However, these variants currently
explain only a small fraction of the genetic heritability (9).
Recent work postulates that there may be up to 65 to 70
common loci underlying CRC susceptibility, requiring large
sample sizes for detection (11); additional avenues of work are
also needed to identify other factors underlying the "missing
heritability" (12). Less common genetic variants, and gene–
environment interactions (GxE) are postulated to explain an
important component (12, 13). In addition, alternative models
(e.g., recessive models) have generally not been tested. A full
examination of the role of GxE underlying CRC will require
genome-wide scans incorporating genetic and environmental
factors and interaction terms across the genome. Nonetheless,
a logical ﬁrst step in exploring the GxE contribution is to
characterize potential effect modiﬁcation of genetic risk variants already identiﬁed as having marginal effects.
This article focuses on potential GxE interactions for the
ﬁrst 10 CRC GWAS loci identiﬁed: 8q24 (MYC), 15q13 (GREM1),
18q21 (SMAD7), 11q23 (LOC120376), 8q23.3 (EIF3H/UTP23),
10p14 (FLJ3802842), 14q22.2 (BMP4), 16q22.1 (CDH1), 19q13.1
(RHPN2), and 20p12.3 (BMP2). In the context of this article, we
use the term "environmental risk factors" broadly to include
nonsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) risk factors,
including sex, which is genetically determined, as well as
factors like tobacco use and height, which themselves may be
intermediate phenotypes with genetic and environmental
determinants. Previous studies have examined gene–environment interactions with selected sets of these known variants
for some environmental covariates. However, these studies
have either focused only on single variants (14–16) or had
relatively small sample sizes and results have been inconsistent
(17, 18). Here, we carry out a more comprehensive examination
of these loci and 12 probable or established CRC risk factors

Patients and Methods
Study participants
The studies used are listed in Table 1 and have been
described in detail previously (10). In brief, we used data from
5 nested case–control studies in prospective U.S. cohorts
[Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS); Nurses' Health
Study (NHS); Physician's Health Study (PHS); Prostate, Lung,
Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO); and
Woman's Health Initiative (WHI)] and 4 case–control studies
from the United States, Canada, and Europe [Assessment of
Risk in Colorectal Tumors in Canada (ARCTIC); French Association STudy Evaluating RISK for sporadic CRC (ASTERISK);
Darmkrebs: Chancen der Verhuetung durch Screening
(DACHS); Diet, Activity and Lifestyle Survey (DALS)]. The
ARCTIC study used subjects from the Ontario Colon Cancer
Family Registry (19). All cases were deﬁned as invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma (International Classiﬁcation of Disease
Code 153-154) and conﬁrmed by medical record, pathology
report, or death certiﬁcate. The studies used nested case–
control or case–control designs with study-speciﬁc eligibility
and matching criteria, except for PLCO. For PLCO, controls
were drawn from the controls used in previous GWAS studies
of prostate cancer and lung cancer available through dbGaP
(20, 21). To account for the different eligibility and matching
criteria used in those GWAS, sampling fraction weights, based
on sex, smoking status, age at entry, and year of entry were used
to weight the PLCO case and controls to be representative of
eligible subjects in the full PLCO cohort. PHS subjects were
matched on smoking status, so that study is excluded from the
summary of main effects of smoking-related variables. Due to
small numbers, we excluded samples reported as racial/ethnic
groups other than "White"; European ancestry was conﬁrmed
in GWAS samples using principal components analysis (22).

Harmonization of environmental data
Information on basic demographics and environmental risk
factors was collected by self-report using in-person interviews
and/or structured questionnaires, as detailed previously
(19, 26–34). We carried out a multistep data harmonization
procedure, reconciling each study's unique protocols and data
collection instruments. First, we deﬁned common data elements (CDE). We examined the questionnaires and data
dictionaries for each study to identify study speciﬁc data
elements that could be mapped to the CDEs. Through an
iterative process, we communicated with each data contributor to obtain relevant data and coding information. The data
elements were written to a common data platform, transformed via a SQL programming script, and combined into a
single data set with common deﬁnitions, standardized permissible values, and standardized coding. The mapping and
resulting data were reviewed for quality assurance, and range
and logic checks were carried out to assess data and data
distributions within and between studies. Outlying samples
were truncated to the minimum or maximum value of

Genotype data
We examined 10 SNPs identiﬁed through published CRC
GWAS before September, 2010 (Table 2). For WHI, PLCO, and
DALS I, genotype data were generated with Illumina HumanHap300k and 240k (PLCO), 550k (WHI, DALS), and 610k (DALS,
PLCO) BeadChip Array Systems on the Inﬁnium platform as
previously described (10). ARCTIC samples were genotyped on
Affymetrix platforms (3) and imputed with BEAGLE (23), using
the phased HapMap release 22 as the reference sample (24). We
used imputed SNPs, coded as the best call genotype, for all 10
SNPs in ARCTIC. The imputation quality was moderate for
rs4939827 (r2 ¼ 0.49) and rs10411210 (r2 ¼ 0.82), and was high
for all other SNPs with imputation r2 ranging from 0.90 to 1.00
(see Supplementary Table S1). For DACHS, DALS II, and
ASTERISK, samples were genotyped with BeadXpress technology according to the manufacturer's protocol (25). For DACHS,
the 8q24 SNP, rs6983267, was not successfully genotyped on
BeadXpress and was replaced, for a subset of the samples (2,849
total), with previous TaqMan genotyping. For ASTERISK, we
used TaqMan results for rs10505477 as a linkage disequilibrium (LD) substitute for rs6983267 (see Supplementary Table
S1). The LD r2 between rs10505477 and rs6983267 in the
HapMap Utah residents with ancestry from northern and
western Europe (CEU) population is 0.93. The NHS, HPFS, and
PHS samples were genotyped using TaqMan OpenArray technology. All genotyping underwent standard quality control
checks (10), including concordance checks for blinded and
unblinded duplicates, examination of sample and SNP call
rates, and checking Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in
controls. Call rate, HWE P value, and minor allele frequency
(MAF) for each SNP in each study are included in Supplementary Table S1. One SNP, rs4444235 at 14q22.2, was excluded
from the NHS study because of the HWE P value in controls
(P ¼ 3  105).

established range for each variable. The reference time for
cohort studies was time of enrollment (WHI and PLCO) or
blood draw (HPFS, NHS, and PHS). The data elements considered were analyzed as continuous variables (BMI and
height); dichotomous variables [sex (male/female), smoking
(ever/never at reference time), aspirin/NSAID use (yes/no for
regular use at reference time; see exact deﬁnitions in Supplementary Table S2)]; ordered categorical variables [alcohol
consumption (3 categories deﬁned by g/d)]; study-speciﬁc
quartiles for smoking pack years (using never smokers as
reference, other quartiles coded 1–4); and sex- and studyspeciﬁc quartiles, in which the quartile groups were coded
with the median value of the quartile within each study and sex
and scaled to a unit scale reﬂective of the distribution for that
variable [dietary calcium (units of 500 mg/d), dietary folate
(units of 500 mcg/d), red meat (units of servings per day),
processed meat (units of servings per day), fruit (units of 5
servings per day), vegetables (units of 5 servings per day), and
dietary ﬁber (units of 10 g/d)]. We use scales such as 500 mg/d
for calcium, to provide more meaningful and easier to interpret
effect sizes. All quartile variables had 4 categories for each sex
within each study. Because some studies collected dietary
information in categories that could not be converted to
study-speciﬁc quartiles, we also examined red meat, processed
meat, vegetables, and fruit as dichotomous variables, cut at
sex- and study-speciﬁc medians. We accounted for the multiple testing burden and potential correlation between these
additional variables using permutation testing, as described in
the Statistical methods section. For all variables, the lowest
category of exposure (or no use) was used as the reference.
Statistical methods
Unless otherwise indicated, we adjusted all regression analyses described below for age, center, and sex, as appropriate.
We used ﬁxed effects meta-analysis methods to obtain summary ORs and 95% CIs across studies. The P values from the
meta-analysis, unadjusted for multiple comparisons, are
termed nominal P values. We report the P value for heterogeneity and examine forest plots for results showing evidence for
heterogeneity. For PLCO, we used inverse sampling fractions as
weights in all analyses to account for study design; for all other
studies, we used equal weights.
Inadequate modeling of the marginal association can bias
interaction testing (35). Therefore, for each SNP and environmental factor, we employed a screening method, based on
logistic regression main-effect associations, to ﬁnd a reasonable form to use for GxE testing. Nested models were compared
using likelihood ratio tests, with a P < 0.05 indicating significantly better performance. For SNPs, we considered assumptions of log-additive (SNPs coded 0/1/2, representing counts of
the minor allele) and recessive (SNPs coded 0/1 in which 0
represents homozygous for common allele or heterozygous
and 1 represents homozygous for the minor allele) modes of
inheritance in comparison with an unrestricted model with
indicator variables for heterozygote and homozygote minor
alleles. We did not consider a dominant mode of inheritance,
because the log-additive model usually does not lose power if
the true model is dominant. If the unrestricted model did not

www.aacrjournals.org

signiﬁcantly outperform the log-additive model, we used the
log-additive model. If the unrestricted model performed signiﬁcantly better than the log-additive model, but not the
recessive model, we used the recessive model. If the unrestricted model performed signiﬁcantly better than the log-additive
and the recessive, we used the unrestricted model. Under this
procedure, we selected the recessive model for rs6983267, and
the log-additive model for the other 9 SNPs. Dichotomous
environmental variables were coded 0/1 and did not require
model selection. For the continuous variables, BMI and height,
we compared main-effects models with and without a quadratic term. In both cases, the model with the quadratic term
did not perform signiﬁcantly better, so we modeled these
variables using only a linear term. For the categorical variables
(alcohol, pack years, and the quartile version of the dietary
variables), we compared a model using a group-linear variable
to a saturated model with indicator variables for each nonreference category. For alcohol, the saturated model performed signiﬁcantly better, so we modeled alcohol with indicator variables. In contrast, for the other variables, the saturated model was not signiﬁcantly better than a model with a
single group-linear term. Thus, we modeled these variables
with their sex- and study-speciﬁc medians, as described above
in the section on data harmonization.
To test for interactions between SNPs and environmental
risk factors, we used an efﬁcient empirical-Bayes (EB) shrinkage method (36). This method creates a weighted average of the
standard case-only and case–control estimators, which is
weighted toward the unbiased case–control estimator when
the assumption of gene–environment independence in the
population is suspect and toward the more efﬁcient case-only
estimator when the assumption is supported by the data. We
modeled both the main effect and interaction based on the
model selected from the main effects, as described above.
Subjects missing data for a particular SNP or environmental
factor were dropped from the analysis for that SNP  factor
interaction test.
Because we carried out 180 tests (10 SNPs  18 versions of
the environmental risk factors), with correlation among
some tests, we used permutations to account for multiple
testing. We ran the analysis 1,000 times using a permuted
case–control status in each run. Then, we used the Westfall
& Young step down procedure (37) to derive the adjusted P
value for each GxE interaction based on the permuted P
values. We term these the adjusted P values and used them
to evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of a given interaction
at the 0.05 level.
For situations in which the EB interaction-term adjusted P <
0.05, we also examined the results from the traditional logistic
regression case–control estimate and examined results adjusting for additional covariates (smoking history, BMI, alcohol
consumption, and red meat consumption). As follow-up analysis, we examined the main effect for the SNP in strata deﬁned
by the environmental risk factor. We also pooled the data
across studies and examined (i) the main effect of the environmental factor in strata deﬁned by the SNP; and (ii) the
combined effect in strata deﬁned by both the SNP and the
environmental factor. As a supplemental analysis, we

examined all 180 SNP  environmental factor GxE interactions
in substratum analyses restricted to colon only and rectal only
cases.
Data harmonization was carried out with SAS and T-SQL. All
other analyses were conducted with the R programming
language.

Results
Study characteristics are described in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3. Table 2 shows the marginal results for each
SNP. As we have previously reported using an overlapping set
of subjects (10), 8 of the 10 loci show statistical evidence for
association with CRC with nominal P values ranging from 0.03
to 4.1  107. One SNP (rs16892766) had a heterogeneity P
value of 0.03; the heterogeneity P value for all other SNPs
ranged from 0.18 to 0.96, indicating little evidence for heterogeneity in the main effects of SNPs across studies. The 2
established SNPs not showing statistical evidence for association are rs10795668 at 10p14 and rs10411210 at 19q13; however, both showed a statistically nonsigniﬁcant OR in the same
direction of association as previous reports (Table 2). Our
model selection procedure indicated a recessive model for
rs6983267 (8q24): the OR for the AA genotype (homozygous for
the minor allele) compared with the ACþCC genotype was 0.82
(0.78–0.89, P ¼ 1.55  106). Focusing on marginal effects for
the environmental risk factors (Fig. 1), we observed statistical
support for an increased risk of CRC with increased processed
meat and red meat consumption (both derived as quartiles
and as median cut points), increasing BMI, ever smoking,
and increasing number of pack-years of smoking. We observed
statistical evidence for a decreased risk for CRC with increased
vegetable consumption (both quartiles and median cut), high
fruit consumption, increased dietary folate, and any aspirin/
NSAID use. Alcohol consumption showed a reduced risk for

expected trends toward inverse associations. We did not

either matched on sex or were restricted to one sex.

OR and P values for log-additive model; ORs represent each
additional copy of minor (C) allele for rs16892766.

The results for the 180 gene–environment interactions
tested are presented in Supplementary Table S4. Six SNP/
environmental factor interactions showed nominal P < 0.01
(Table 3; forest plots for individual study results are in Supplementary Fig. S1). The lowest nominal P value was for
rs16892766, with vegetables as quartiles (ORinteraction ¼ 1.88,
95% CI: 1.36–2.59; nominal Pinteraction ¼ 1.3  104). rs16892766
has a MAF of 0.1 in the CEU population and is located on
chromosome 8q23.3. This was the only ﬁnding with an adjusted
P < 0.05 (adjusted P ¼ 0.02). Because of potential correlations
between the environmental factors tested, we used permutations methods to adjust for multiple comparisons. A Bonferroni correction assumes the tests are independent. For the
permutations, the cutoff that corresponds to a family wise
error rate of 0.05 can be calculated by taking the 5th percentile
of the minimum of P values of all tests across all permutation
runs. For our data, it was 3.75  104, slightly less conservative
than the Bonferroni cutoff 0.05/180 ¼ 2.78  104. The
rs16892766/vegetable consumption interaction was statistically signiﬁcant with either correction. This same SNP had a
nominal Pinteraction < 0.01 for processed ﬁber as quartiles
(nominal Pinteraction ¼ 6.0  104; adjusted P ¼ 0.09) and for
vegetables dichotomized at sex- and study-speciﬁc medians
(nominal Pinteraction ¼ 3.5  103; adjusted P ¼ 0.40). The
correlation between vegetable quartiles and ﬁber quartiles in
this data set was 0.65. Table 4 shows the association with CRC
risk in strata deﬁned by quartiles of vegetable consumption.
The magnitude of the main effect of the minor (C) allele for this
SNP increased with increasing levels of vegetable consumption, ranging from no evidence for association (OR ¼ 0.94; 95%
CI: 0.77–1.15; nominal P ¼ 0.54) in the lowest quartile to a
relatively strong association for a common genetic factor (OR
¼ 1.40; 95% CI: 1.13–1.74; nominal P ¼ 0.002) in the highest
quartile. Results of the pooled analysis showing associations
for vegetables in strata deﬁned by levels of the SNP, and the
combined association in strata deﬁned by rs16892766 genotype
and vegetable consumption are shown in Supplementary
Materials (Supplemental Tables S5 and S6).
The rs16892766/vegetable-consumption results were not
altered when we adjusted for additional covariates; interaction
OR (adjusted for ever-smoked, BMI, alcohol use, red meat, and
processed meat consumption) ¼ 1.90 (95% CI: 1.35–2.67;

www.aacrjournals.org

nominal Pinteraction ¼ 2.48  104). A similar magnitude of
interaction was seen using traditional case–control
logistic analysis (ORinteraction ¼ 1.79; 95% CI: 1.23–2.59; nominal
Pinteraction ¼ 2.3  103).
In supplementary analyses of all GxE interactions stratiﬁed
by cancer site (colon vs. rectum; Supplementary Table S7), the
strongest statistical evidence for gene–environment interaction among colon cancer cases were for the same rs16892766/
vegetable-consumption (ORinteraction ¼ 1.79; 95% CI: 1.28–
2.51; nominal Pinteraction ¼ 6.5  104) and rs16892766/ﬁber
(ORinteraction ¼ 1.31; 95% CI: 1.12–1.53; nominal Pinteraction ¼ 9.8
 104) interactions observed for the combined CRC. For
rectal cases, with a smaller sample size, the rs16892766/vegetable-consumption interaction was not statistically signiﬁcant (interaction OR for rectal cancer ¼ 1.51; 95% CI: 0.57–4.03;
Pinteraction ¼ 0.41), and the only interaction with nominal
P < 0.01 was rs4779584 and dietary calcium (nominal P ¼
6.7  103).

Discussion
We carried out an evaluation of GxE interactions for 10 SNPs
identiﬁed through CRC GWAS with probable and established
environmental risk factors. Our analysis of more than 7,000
CRC cases and 9,700 controls from 9 well-characterized cohort
and case–control studies showed evidence of an interaction
between the rs16892766 SNP and quartiles of vegetable consumption (nominal Pinteraction ¼ 1.3  104; adjusted P ¼ 0.02).
None of the other gene–environment interactions examined
was statistically signiﬁcant after accounting for multiple
testing.
The rs16892766 SNP is in an LD region on chromosome
8q23.3. Two studies have ﬁne-mapped this region in relation to
CRC risk (38, 39). Both found the strongest signals for a cluster
of 5 SNPs, including rs16892766, that are in high LD; Pittman
and colleagues also identiﬁed a sixth SNP in the cluster that is
not in the public databases (39). Neither study found evidence
for secondary independent signals in this region. The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit H (EIF3H) gene is the
closest gene to this cluster, with the identiﬁed SNPs 140kb
downstream from the gene transcript. Initial functional studies
indicated that the rs16892766 region interacts with the EIF3H
promoter and represses gene expression (39); however, a
subsequent examination of ENCODE data and eQTLs suggests
that the variants in this region may be inﬂuencing expression
levels of the neighboring UTP23, small subunit processome
component, homolog (yeast; UTP23) gene, rather than EIF3H
itself. The variants may also impact expression of both genes
(38). Additional work is needed to elucidate the functional
relationship between EIF3H or UTP23, or both, and CRC
etiology. As the functional role of this SNP and other variants
in the region is unknown, we cannot currently make informed
speculations on how it might relate to vegetable consumption.
Vegetable consumption has long been hypothesized to be
protective against CRC (40), although epidemiologic studies
are not fully consistent [see review in (41)]. A recent metaanalysis of 1,694,236 participants including 16,057 colorectal
cases with data on vegetable consumption from prospective

Hutter et al.

cohort studies found a statistically signiﬁcant nonlinear
inverse association between both fruit and vegetable intake
with CRC risk and the summary relative risk for the highest
versus lowest intake for vegetables was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86–0.96;
ref. 42). The postulated mechanisms have primarily focused on
vegetables as a source of ﬁber and micronutrients, including
folate (43). We also observed some evidence for interaction
between the rs16892766 SNP and quartiles of both ﬁber intake
(ORinteraction ¼ 1.33; 95% CI (1.13–1.56); Pinteraction ¼ 6.0  104;
adjusted P ¼ 0.09), and dietary folate intake (ORinteraction ¼
1.34; 95% CI: 1.08–1.67; Pinteraction ¼ 8.2  103; adjusted P ¼
0.71). As with vegetable consumption, the pattern was for an
increased risk associated with the minor (C) allele at higher
levels of consumption. Vegetable consumption shows a positive correlation with both ﬁber (correlation ¼ 0.65) and folate
(correlation ¼ 0.49) in these studies and it is difﬁcult to
disentangle the different measures using reported dietaryintake measures. Future follow-up of this interaction could
focus more speciﬁcally on biomarkers for different dietary
components.
Although we did not observe statistically signiﬁcant evidence for heterogeneity in the rs16892766/vegetable-consumption interaction, we did observe minor evidence for
heterogeneity for the main effect of the rs16892766 SNP in
the full sample (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.030). We considered the
possibility that the underlying GxE interaction may have been
contributing to the observed heterogeneity. However, we
observed similar evidence of heterogeneity for the main effect
of rs16892766 in strata deﬁned by levels of vegetable consumption (Pheterogeneity ¼ 0.02–0.20). These results indicate that the
minor level of observed heterogeneity for this SNP did not
result from the rs16892766/vegetable-consumption interaction. Additional avenues would need to be explored for the
source of this potential heterogeneity in association.
Previous studies of CRC risk have reported potential
interactions with the 10 known loci in relation to age, family
history, and sex (2, 5, 7, 17, 44, 45); however, the results have
been inconsistent. Additional studies have looked at GxE for
a broader range of environmental factors (14–18), but ours is
the ﬁrst to report a statistically signiﬁcant interaction
between rs16892766 and vegetable consumption. Using the
DALS study, Slattery and colleagues observed an interaction
between rs4939827, on 18q21 near the SMAD7 gene, and
recent aspirin/NSAID use (16). We observed evidence for
that interaction in the DALS study alone (Pinteraction ¼ 0.03).
However, we did not observe evidence for this association
across the other studies, including analysis restricted to
colon cancer only. This may reﬂect differences in how
aspirin/NSAID use was collected across studies (Supplementary Table S2): for example, the time frame was 2 years
before diagnosis for DALS and the other case–control studies, whereas for the cohort studies, baseline data describe a
variable number of years before diagnosis. It might also
reﬂect other underlying differences among the studies, a
false positive in the initial report, or a false negative in
the present study. Using a discovery set not included in
this report, Figueiredo and colleagues examined GxE interactions for these same 10 loci with more than 10 environ-

mental factors in a sample of 1,191 and 999 unrelated
population–based controls (18). They observed several suggestive gene–environment interactions, although none were
replicated in an independent sample that overlaps with the
ARCTIC sample used in this article. Furthermore, that
analysis was restricted to MSS/MSI-L CRC cases, which have
different environmental risk factors (46) and, therefore,
perhaps different underlying gene–environment interactions than the more broadly deﬁned CRC cases used in this
study.
Strengths of this study include the large sample size and
standardized harmonization. We adopted a ﬂexible approach
to retrospective harmonization, using methods similar to
those proposed by other projects (47, 48). Not every study was
included for some of the environmental factors considered,
either because they did not collect that particular variable or
because they did not collect information in a way that was
considered inferentially equivalent. We limited our study to
variables that could be combined across at least 50% of the
studies and we used yes/no and study-speciﬁc quartiles as
forms of variables. These forms are most easily comparable
across studies. As in many epidemiologic studies, measurement error may be leading to false negatives. We may be
missing interactions that would have been found through
inclusion of other environmental factors, through different
assessments of the environmental variables or through different models, including fully saturated models (35).
The lack of evidence for other GxE interactions for most loci
identiﬁed through initial GWAS is similar to what has been
observed in prostate and breast cancer (49–52). This is not
surprising given that the loci were identiﬁed through largescale discovery and replication. SNPs with a strong GxE might
show more heterogeneity across studies and may be less likely
to appear as the strongest marginal signals. A full examination
of the role of gene–environment interactions in CRC will
require large, well-powered, genome-wide investigations with
well measured and harmonized environmental risk factor data.
