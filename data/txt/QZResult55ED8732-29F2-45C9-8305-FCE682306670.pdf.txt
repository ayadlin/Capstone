Abstract
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex and heterogeneous disease. Obesity increases
the risk of obese T2D; but in Asia non-obese T2D is prevalent. The cause of nonobese T2D has remained elusive. We studied the potential involvement of HGK/
MAP4K4 in T2D using clinical samples from newly diagnosed, drug-naïve patients
and healthy controls. HGK levels fell and IL-6 levels increased in T cells from T2D
patients. Frequencies of IL-6-producing T cells were correlated with glucose levels
after glucose-tolerance tests (but not body mass index and waist circumference) and
inversely correlated with HGK expression levels. Moreover, methylation frequencies
of the HGK promoter were increased in T2D patients and correlated with glucose
levels after glucose-tolerance tests. The correlation was independent of body mass
index. Demethylation treatment increased HGK expression levels and reduced IL-6
production in T2D T cells. This report identifies HGK methylation/downregulation in
T cells as a potential biomarker for non-obese T2D.

INTRODUCTION

[7]. Besides an increase in macrophages, an increase in
CD8+ T cells or Th1 cells in adipose tissues contributes
to T2D development in high-fat diet HFD-fed mice [8,
9]. Studying immunometabolism might help develop
treatment for and prevention of T2D.
HPK1/GCK-like kinase (HGK/MAP4K4) is a
member of MAP kinase kinase kinase kinases (MAP4Ks),
which belong to the Ste20-like serine/threonine kinase
family [10, 11]. The involvement of HGK in macrophage
TNF-α signaling and adipocyte insulin resistance has
been reported in studies using siRNA knockdown and
overexpression systems [12, 13]. In the genotyping for
tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 1769
DNA samples from the peripheral blood of prediabetic
Europeans [14], two SNPs in the HGK locus were found
to be associated with increased glucose levels in patients,
while two other HGK SNPs were associated with reduced
insulin release only in lean subjects (BMI < 25) [14].

One of the major risk factors for type 2 diabetes
(T2D) is obesity. However, not all obese individuals
develop diabetes, and not all T2D patients are obese
(body mass index (BMI) greater than 30) [1]. According
to WHO criteria for body obesity (BMI ≥ 30), non-obese
T2D comprises about 80% of T2D cases in Asia, 55%
of those in Europe, and 20% of those in North America
and Australia [1-3]. In addition, based on WHO Expert
Consultation in 2002 and epidemiological studies in Asia
[4], the BMI criteria in Asia are adjusted lower (normal,
overweight, and obese are BMI < 23, 23 ≤ BMI < 27.5,
and BMI ≥ 27.5, respectively). Although the cut-off values
for obesity are decreased, there are still many non-obese
patients with T2D in Asia: about 70% of the total T2D
in that continent [5, 6]. Dysregulation of the immune
system plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of T2D

frequencies of IL-6-producing monocytes were not
increased in IGT or T2D patients (Figure 1B and 1C).
Our previous publication reported that HGK-deficient
IL-6-producing T cells further differentiate into IL-6+
Th17 cells [17], thus, we also studied whether the IL-17
cytokine is also produced in IL-6+ T cells from human
T2D patients. The IL-6-producing T cells from all 18
T2D patients also produced IL-17. However, the IL-6+ T
cells from 2 of 13 IGT patients contained both IL-17+ and
IL-17- populations, while the IL-6+ T cell from the other
11 IGT patients were all IL-17+ T cells (Supplementary
Figure S3). In contrast, the plasma IL-17 (or IL-6) levels
were enhanced in both IGT and T2D patients compared
to those in healthy controls (Supplementary Figure S2a,
S2c). These results suggest that the peripheral blood IL-6producing (IL-6+ IL-17+ ) T cells, instead of plasma IL-6
or IL-17 levels, are putative biomarkers for T2D.
To study whether the enhancement of IL-6producing T cells plays a role in glucose intolerance,
univariate linear regression was initially used to determine
the correlation between IL-6-producing T cells and OGTT
glucose levels. The frequencies of IL-6-producing T
cells from the 48 individuals were correlated with OGTT
glucose levels (adjusted r = 0.587; P value = 1.143 ×
10-5; unstandardized coefficient = 4.499, 95% CI, 2.6596.3402) (Figure 1D). After removing one outlier that
showed high residual value (modulus = 220.762 > 100;
standardized residual = 4.173 > 3) in univariate linear
regression analyses, the remaining 47 individuals showed
even higher correlation (adjusted r = 0.711; P value = 2.19
× 10-8; unstandardized coefficient = 4.799, 95% confidence
interval, 3.372-6.225) between the frequencies of IL-6producing T cells and OGTT glucose levels (Figure 1D
and Table 1). The frequencies of IL-6-producing T cells
were not correlated with the values of insulin resistance
index HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment of
insulin resistance) (Table 1 lower panel and Figure 2A),
perhaps because HOMA-IR calculation includes fasting
insulin levels. The downregulation of fasting insulin
levels in severe T2D patients suggests the development
of β-cell failure. Indeed, the values of β-cell function
index HOMA-β (homeostasis model assessment-β),
calculated using fasting insulin levels and fasting glucose
levels, were much lower in several T2D patients (Figure
2B). After excluding data of four T2D patients with the
lowest 25% HOMA-β values (< 35), the frequencies of
IL-6-producing T cells were in fact well correlated with
HOMA-IR values (adjusted r = 0.526; P value = 0.00029;
Table 1 lower panel and Figure 2C). The correlation
between OGTT glucose levels and HOMA-IR values was
also higher after excluding these four patients (adjusted r =
0.539; P value = 0.00019; Table 1 upper panel). Although
central obesity is thought to be a risk factor for T2D in
Asians [20], central obesity and BMI were not correlated
with OGTT glucose levels (Table 1). Multivariate linear
regression analyses further showed that individuals with

Paradoxically, a fifth SNP and one of the latter two HGK
SNPs are associated with enhanced plasma IL-6 but not
with TNF-α levels [14]. Thus, the relative contribution
of HGK expression to the pathophysiology of T2D may
be mediated by cells other than macrophages. To date,
the roles of two other MAP4Ks, HPK1 (MAP4K1) and
GLK (MAP4K3), in T-cell signaling and T-cell-mediated
immune responses have been demonstrated [15, 16].
Recently, we studied the in vivo role of HGK in immune
responses by generating T-cell-specific HGK conditional
knockout (T-HGK cKO) mice; we found that these mice
displayed higher serum IL-6 levels and spontaneously
developed insulin resistance without large weight
gain [17]. Thus, we hypothesized that the loss of HGK
expression in T cells and the increase of IL-6-producing T
cells are associated with human T2D.

RESULTS
Downregulation of HGK and induction of IL-6producing T cells in the peripheral blood of T2D
patients
Because HGK deletion in T cells leads to the
development of T2D in mice [17], we studied whether
HGK levels are decreased in peripheral blood T cells of
human T2D patients using clinical samples from drugnaïve, impaired-glucose-tolerance (IGT; a pre-diabetic
state) and T2D patients, along with samples from healthy
controls (Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary
Figure S1). Although intracellular staining of HGK
expression using five different anti-HGK antibodies did
not work with flow cytometry, immunoblotting analyses
were able to detect HGK expression in T cells. Strikingly,
the expression of HGK was drastically reduced in the T
cells of 72% (8 in 11) of T2D patients and was modestly
reduced in the T cells of some (2 in 4) IGT patients (Figure
1A).
Because an association between HGK SNPs and
induced plasma IL-6 has been reported, the plasma IL-6
levels in T2D patients were determined. The plasma
levels of IL-6 but not IFN-γ were significantly increased
in both IGT and T2D patients (Supplementary Figure
S2). To study whether IL-6 is secreted from T cells,
peripheral blood leukocytes were freshly collected from
48 individuals and subjected to flow cytometry analysis
(Subgroup II; Supplementary Table S1). Consistent with
plasma cytokine levels, IL-6-producing T cells were
significantly increased in freshly isolated peripheral blood
cells of T2D patients (Figure 1B and 1C). Approximately
half of IGT patients will progress to T2D over their
lifetime [18, 19]. We found that the frequencies of IL6-producing T cells were increased in 7 of total 13 IGT
patients compared to healthy controls. In addition, the

IL-6-overproducing T cells were at significantly increased
risk for enhancement of OGTT glucose levels after
adjusting for sex, age, and BMI (standardized coefficient
β = 0.641; P value < 0.001) or adjusting for sex, age, and
waist circumference (standardized coefficient β = 0.638;
P value < 0.001) (Table 2). These results suggest that IL6-producing T cells may be involved in the pathogenesis
of human T2D.
T2D patients displayed lower HGK expression
levels in T cells and higher frequencies of IL-6-producing
T cells compared to healthy controls (Table 3). HGK
expression levels were inversely correlated with IL-6producing T cells (r = -0.593; unstandardized coefficient
= -0.077, 95% confidence interval, -0.125 to -0.029; P
value = 0.0029). In fact, all six T2D patients whose BMI

was below 23 (i.e., below normal weight in Asia) showed
both HGK downregulation and IL-6 overproduction
(Table 3). Conversely, HGK expression was not greatly
reduced in the three T2D patients (BMI = 26.6, 26.8, and
23.9) who did not have increased IL-6-producing T cells
(Table 3). To confirm that IL-6 overproduction in T cells
is indeed caused by HGK downregulation, HGK was
ectopically expressed in patient T cells. The frequencies
of IL-6-producing T cells from insulin resistant patients
were significantly decreased after ectopic HGK expression
(Figure 3A and 3B; P = 0.004). Conversely, IL-6 levels
secreted from purified peripheral blood T cells were
spontaneously induced by HGK shRNA knockdown
(Figure 3C), while IL-17 levels were not induced
(Supplementary Figure S4). These results suggest that

HGK downregulation in human T cells is responsible for
IL-6 induction.

we investigated whether reversal of the epigenetic
modification by demethylation restores HGK expression.
The primary T cells from human subjects were treated with
the methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (5-AZAC).
After demethylation treatment, the mRNA expression of
HGK was increased by 3.5 fold (95% CI, 2.0 to 4.9; P
value < 0.0001) in T cells from T2D patients (Figure 4D).
In contrast, the response to 5-AZAC was abrogated in T
cells from healthy controls (Figure 4D). This could be due
to that the demethylation treatment cannot further reduce
the already low levels of HGK methylation in T cells
from healthy controls. Consistent with that, IL-6 mRNA
levels were decreased in T2D T cells after demethylation
treatment (Supplementary Figure S5). Demethylation of
the HGK promoter in the 5-AZAC-treated T cells could
not be demonstrated by pyrosquencing on the same
clinical samples because only small number of peripheral
blood T cells are available from drug-naïve T2D patients;
therefore, other potential or indirect effects of 5-AZAC on
these treated cells cannot be formally ruled out. These data
suggest that enhanced methylation on the HGK promoter
may cause HGK downregulation and subsequent IL-6
upregulation in T cells.

Enhanced methylation of the HGK promoter
correlates with glucose intolerance
Consistent with the protein levels, mRNA levels of
HGK were significantly reduced in the peripheral blood T
cells purified from T2D patients (Figure 4A; P = 0.016).
We studied whether downregulation of HGK transcription
is due to enhanced methylation of CpG islands in its
promoter region (Figure 4B). Pyrosequencing 163 DNA
samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
from normal glucose tolerance (NGT) or T2D individuals
showed increased methylation frequencies at all 43
sequenced CpG sites within the HGK promoter regions
in T2D patients compared to those in NGT individuals
(Figure 4C). To evaluate the potential role of HGK
methylation in T2D pathogenesis, we studied whether
HGK methylation frequencies at individual CpG sites are
correlated with any clinical parameters. We found that the
methylation frequencies at many (34 of 43) positions were
correlated with OGTT glucose levels (Supplementary
Table S2); in particular, the correlation coefficients were
high (r > 0.5) at positions 1-5 and 7-10 within the HGK
promoter (table 4). Surprisingly, the correlations between
HGK methylation frequencies and OGTT glucose levels
at these positions were very high (r = 0.603 to 0.801)
in the normal (BMI ≤ 23) sub-population compared to
those in the overweight or obese sub-population (Table
4). The average waist circumference of the male (n = 29)
and female (n = 9) normal sub-populations (BMI ≤ 23)
were 82.1 ± 6.3 cm and 74.5 ± 2.9 cm, respectively; the
International Diabetes Federation’s criteria for defining
central obesity for Chinese men and women are waist
circumference of 90 cm and 80 cm, respectively (Table
4). In contrast, HGK methylation frequencies were not
correlated with age, gender, smoking status, or low-density
lipoprotein levels, and were slightly correlated with BMI
(at only 8 out of 43 positions; Supplementary Table S2).
To verify the significance of the correlation between
the HGK methylation frequencies and OGTT glucose
levels, the data were further analyzed using multivariate
linear regression analyses. After adjusting for age,
gender, BMI, and smoking status, OGTT glucose levels
were indeed correlated with the methylation frequencies
(at 24 in 43 positions) but not with the other 4 clinical
parameters (Table 5 and Supplementary Table S3). Thus,
the correlation between HGK methylation and glucose
intolerance is independent of age, gender, BMI, and
smoking. Taken together, our data suggest that individuals
with higher methylation frequencies of the HGK promoter
have high risks of glucose intolerance.

HGK promoter negatively regulates HGK expression,

DISCUSSION
Obesity is a major risk factor of T2D; nevertheless,
not all T2D patients in Asia and Europe are obese T2D
[1-3]. It appears that both obesity-dependent and obesityindependent pathways contribute to T2D. Here we
propose a potential obesity-independent pathway of T2D
pathogenesis. We found that HGK expression levels were
decreased and IL-6 production is increased in T cells
from drug-naïve, non-obese T2D patients. Notably, the
frequencies of IL-6-producing T cells were correlated
with OGTT glucose levels independent of either BMI
or waist circumference. The methylation frequencies of
the HGK promoter were correlated with OGTT glucose
levels in T2D patients regardless of BMI. Moreover,
the demethylation treatment restored HGK expression
in T cells; ectopic HGK expression inhibited IL-6
production in patient T cells. These data are consistent
with a previous report that T-cell-specific HGK knockout
mice spontaneously develop non-obese T2D [17]. These
findings suggest that HGK downregulation and subsequent
IL-6 overproduction in human T cells may play important
roles in the pathogenesis of non-obese T2D.
Recent reports have provided evidence that
gastrointestinal microbiota and nutrients control the
pathogenesis of T2D [21]. Moreover, environmental
factors such as nutrients, hormones, and toxins regulate
metabolic diseases through DNA methylation [22].
Our results showed that the correlation between HGK
methylation frequencies and OGTT glucose levels in the
normal sub-population was generally higher than that in
the obese sub-population. Our results also showed that

Shown are the level of HGK expression and the frequency of IL-6-producing T cells in individual IGT or T2D patients whose
immunoblot data were available. The frequency of IL-6-producing T cells for one patient (#5) was not determined (ND). Fold
denotes HGK levels of individual samples relative to that of the first healthy control on each membrane (Figure 1A).
the correlation between HGK methylation and glucose
intolerance was independent of BMI, smoking, age, and
gender. These data suggest that HGK methylation and
downregulation in patients enrolled in this study are not
regulated by obesity, glucose, insulin, smoking, or sex
hormone. However, it is possible that obesity is still a
contributing factor to HGK downregulation in other ethnic
T2D patients. Thus, further identification of risk factors
(e.g., gastrointestinal microbiota, diet, and environmental
factors) that regulate HGK methylation may help
understanding of the mechanism of the T2D pathogenesis.
In addition, about 25% of T2D patients enrolled in this
study did not show any increase of IL-6-producing T
cells or downregulation of HGK, suggesting that other
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pathways independent of the HGK/IL-6 pathway may also
contribute to T2D in these patients.
Recent studies have highlighted an important role
of T cells in regulating T2D [9, 23]. IFN-γ-producing Th1
cells were induced in HFD-fed mice [9]. Consistently,
a different study found that T cells isolated from T2D
patients in the United States show significantly increased
IFN-γ levels after in vitro stimulation with PHA or antiCD3/CD28 [23]. Furthermore, another report showed
that the Th1 (T-bet+) to Treg ratios in adipose tissues
were correlated with BMI from five patients in North
America [9]. Thus, IFN-γ-producing Th1 cells may be
involved in obesity-induced T2D. In contrast, the IFN-γ
levels or Th1 to Treg ratios from in vitro stimulated

critical role in the induction of high leptin levels in adipose
tissue of T-cell-specific HGK conditional knockout mice
[17]. Based on these findings [17], we propose that in
human subjects, IL-6+ T cells could induce high levels of
leptin, which in turn cooperates with IL-6 in subsequent
induction of Th17 differentiation in adipose tissue
microenvironment. In addition, IL-17 attenuates adipocyte
accumulation by inhibiting adipogenesis [25]. Taken
together, it is likely that non-obese T2D patients in Asia
contain sufficient adipose tissue to drive the pathogenesis
of T2D. Interestingly, several publications support this
notion. Visceral, but not subcutaneous, abdominal fat
is associated with insulin resistance in Indian subjects,
whose average BMI is 23 in males and 24 in females [26].
Moreover, hepatic insulin resistance in USA T2D patients
is correlated with visceral fat/subcutaneous fat ratio but
not with BMI or total fat mass [27]. Taken together, we
propose a novel hypothesis that HGK-downregulated
IL-6+ Th17 cells promote visceral fat-mediated T2D
independent of BMI. Our findings suggest that HGK/
MAP4K4 in peripheral blood T cells is a useful biomarker
for non-obese T2D.

patient T cells were not correlated with HbA1c levels
in T2D patients in China [24]. Our results showed that
drug-naïve IGT and T2D patients from Asia displayed
increases in plasma IL-6 levels but not in IFN-γ levels.
Importantly, the freshly isolated blood T cells from these
patients showed that the frequencies of IL-6-producing T
cells were highly correlated with OGTT glucose levels.
Our previous publication also showed that normal diet-fed
wild-type mice develop glucose intolerance after adoptive
transferring with HGK-deficient IL-6-producing T cells
[17]. Taken together, the numbers of IFN-γ-producing T
cells and IL-6-producing T cells may reflect the severity
of obese T2D and non-obese T2D, respectively. Thus, both
HGK downregulation in T cells and high-fat diet are risk
factors for T2D.
Non-obese T2D is prevalent in Asia [1]. Our recent
study demonstrates that IL-6+ Th17 cells cause insulin
resistance in T-cell-specific HGK conditional knockout
mice without inducing obesity and that the differentiation
of these pathogenic IL-6+ Th17 cells in adipose tissue
requires a synergistic effect of IL-6 (from T cells) and
leptin (from adipocytes) [17]. Moreover, IL-6 plays a

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Reagents and plasmids
Anti-HGK antibody and HGK expression plasmids
were as described previously [17]. The HGK short hairpin
RNA plasmids were established by the National RNAi
Core Facility (Taiwan). Anti-GAPDH and anti-tubulin
antibodies were purchased from Sigma. TaqMan probe
for HGK and primer sets for IL-6 were from Applied
Biosystems and Bio-Rad Laboratories, respectively.
Quantitative real-time PCR was performed by CFX96
Touch™ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad).
The IL-6 and IFN-γ ELISA kits were purchased from
eBioscience.

Study participants
A total of 228 individuals, including 73 healthy
individuals and 155 patients, were enrolled in this study
during 2010-2014. These 155 drug-naïve patients were
newly diagnosed as having either impaired glucose
tolerance (IGT) or T2D, based on the criteria of the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) [19]. The glucose
level after oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) was used as
a diagnostic for IGT (140-199 mg/dl) and T2D (> 200 mg/
dl). Patients with IGT were classified as prediabetic. The
67 individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and
6 healthy volunteers were used as healthy controls (HC).
The main characteristics of these patients and the analysis
plan of clinical samples are summarized in Supplementary
Table S1 and Fig. S1, respectively. The β-cell function was
evaluated with the insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2
(ISSI-2) and HOMA-β. HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, and ISSI2 were determined from the same OGTT. HOMA-IR =
fasting insulin (μU/ml) × fasting glucose (mmol/l) / 22·5.
HOMA-β= [20 ×fasting insulin (μU/ml)] / [fasting glucose
- 3·5 (mmol/l)]. ISSI-2 = [the area under the insulin curve
(AUC insulin) / the area under the glucose curve (AUC
glucose)] / insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index). Matsuda
index = 10,000 / [fasting glucose (mmol/l) × fasting insulin
(µU/ml) × 120 min glucose (mmol/l) × 120 min insulin
(µU/ml)]0·5 [28]. All patients were referred to the Division
of Endocrinology and Metabolism at Taichung Veterans
General Hospital in Taiwan. All experiments were
performed in accordance with the guidelines and protocols
approved by the Ethics Committee of Clinical Research,
Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan. Written
informed consent (approved by the Ethics Committee
of Clinical Research, approval number #C08215) was
obtained from all patients before enrollment in this study.

Flow cytometry analyses
Peripheral blood leukocytes were isolated from
human subjects and immediately treated with Golgi-stop,
followed by cell surface staining and intracellular staining
[17]. The antibodies used for staining are as follows. AntihCD3-PE-Cy7 (SK7), and anti-hCD3-APC-Cy7 (SK7)
antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. AntihIL-6-PE (MQ-13A5) antibody was from eBioscience.

Transient transfection of primary T cells
For transient transfection assays, primary T cells
were transfected using the Neon Transfection System
(Invitrogen Corp.). The settings for human primary T cells
(1×107) were 2200 V, duration of 20 ms, and 1 pulse.

Statistical analyses
The normality of each column data was determined
by Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests using
SPSS 19 software. The statistical significances between
two unpaired groups were analyzed using two-tailed
Student’s t-test and two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test for
normally distributed data and non-normally distributed
data, respectively. The relationship of two variables in
the human subjects was initially studied using univariate
linear regression analyses. Variables with P-values less
than 0·05 on the univariate linear regression analysis were
considered to be potential risk factors related to glucose
intolerance. Next, multivariate linear regression analyses
were used to adjust for confounders including age and sex.
Power calculations were performed using G*power 3.1.6
software (available at http://www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.
de/abteilungen/aap/gpower3/download-and-register). The
statistical analyses were independently verified by two
biostatisticians.

Measurement of HGK methylation levels
Pyrosequencing was performed by Mission
Biotech (Taipei, Taiwan) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions to validate and dissect the methylation
frequencies of CpG sites in region -628 to -20 from the
transcription start site of the HGK gene. The lack of
pyrosequencing for some segments within this region
of the HGK promoter is due to an unsuccessful primer
pair for these GC-rich segments. Briefly, a biotin-labeled
primer and bisulfate-converted DNA were mixed and
subjected to PCR. Subsequently, the PCR products were
denatured and released to single-strand products for
pyrosequencing using the PyroMark Q24 system (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). Methylation frequencies of each CpG
sites were analyzed by PyroMark Q24 software.
