ABSTRACT
Cancer death is a leading cause of global mortality. An estimated 14.1 million new
cancer cases and 8.2 million cancer deaths occurred worldwide in 2012 alone. Cancer
stem cells (CSCs) within tumors are essential for tumor metastasis and reoccurrence,
the key factors of cancer lethality. Here we report that 4EGI-1, an inhibitor of the
interaction between translation initiation factors eIF4E1 and eIF4G1 effectively
inhibits breast CSCs through selectively reducing translation persistent in breast
CSCs. Translation initiation factor eIF4E1 is significantly enhanced in breast CSCs in
comparison to non-CSC breast cancer cells. 4EGI-1 presents increased cytotoxicity
to breast CSCs compared to non-CSC breast cancer cells. 4EGI-1 promotes breast
CSC differentiation and represses breast CSC induced tube-like structure formation
of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). 4EGI-1 isomers suppress breast
CSC tumorangiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo. In addition, 4EGI-1 decreases
proliferation in and induces apoptosis into breast CSC tumor cells. Furthermore, 4EGI1 selectively inhibits translation of mRNAs encoding NANOG, OCT4, CXCR4, c-MYC
and VEGF in breast CSC tumors. Our study demonstrated that 4EGI-1 targets breast
CSCs through selective inhibition of translation critical for breast CSCs, suggesting
that selective translation initiation interference might be an avenue targeting CSCs
within tumors.

INTRODUCTION

tumor growth, metastasis, CSC heterogeneity, and drug
resistance[7, 8]. Protein synthesis is central for CSCs
self-renewal, maintenance, differentiation, growth and
dissemination.
Translation generally initiates with the recruitment
of eIF4F to the 5’- m7GpppN cap of messenger RNA
(mRNA)[9, 10]. eIF4F is a complex composed of the
cap-binding protein eIF4E1, scaffold protein eIF4G1 and
RNA helicase eIF4A. The eIF4E1/eIF4G1 interaction
is necessary for eIF4F assembly[10-12]. The mRNAs
encoding proteins important for cell proliferation and
growth frequently harbor secondary structure and/or
long 5’-UTR, or other regulatory elements. Translation
of mRNAs with structured and/or long 5’-UTR is highly
eIF4E1 dependent[13, 14]. Consistently, enhanced
eIF4E1 levels and/or activities have been demonstrated
in a number of cancers in clinical observations[15-18].
The human eIF4E family has three members of eIF4E1,

Cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide.
Global cancer burden increased to 14.1 million new cases
and 8.2 million cancer deaths in 2012 from 12.7 million
and 7.6 million respectively, in 2008. Cancer metastasis
and reoccurrence are the major resources of cancer
lethality. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) form a subpopulation
of cells within tumors and are essential for tumor
dissemination and relapse[1]. The acquired properties
that make CSCs adaptive to micro-environmental
stresses and enhanced resistance to chemo-/radiationtherapy, present a challenge for targeting CSCs within
tumors[2-4]. Heterogenetic CSCs are believed to acquire
diverse adaptive changes in genetic, epigenetic, signal
transduction, metabolic, transcriptional and translational
levels[5, 6]. Translation is essential for all aspects of tumor
evolution, including tumorigenesis, tumorangiogenesis,

eIF4E2 and eIF4E3. The eIF4E2-RBM4-HIF-2α complex
can initiate translation but eIF4E2 does not bind to
eIF4G1[19, 20]. eIF4E3 competes with eIF4E1 in binding
cap and acts as a tumor suppressor[21]. Multiple proteins
have been demonstrated to be enhanced in breast CSCs,
such as the CSC markers NANOG and OCT4[22], the
metastasis regulator CXCR4[23, 24], the epithelial–
mesenchymal transition (EMT)[25] regulator c-MYB[26],
or the cell proliferation key factors c-MYC[27] and cyclin
D1[28, 29].
Due to the central roles in cancer evolution,
translation is targeted in anti-cancer drug development.
Several agents targeting translation initiation have been
developed[30, 31], including the small molecule 4EGI1[32]. 4EGI-1 binds eIF4E1, prevents recruitment of
eIF4E1 to eIF4G1. The compound mimics the function
of 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), which regulates
eIF4E1-eIF4G interaction in a phosphorylation–dependent
manner; however, 4EGI-1 does not displace 4E-BP1 from
eIF4E1[32]. 4EGI-1 exhibits inhibitory effects in several
cancer cell lines[33-35].
Recently, we have isolated and identified a small
fast adhesion subpopulation (CD44high/CD24low)FA from
HMLER human mammary epithelial cancer cells [1, 2]
that show the typical properties of cancer stem cells and
are referred to as breast cancer stem cells (CSCs)[36].
These breast CSCs showed enhanced drug resistance to
the anti-cancer drugs actinomycin D and camptothecin
(about 10-fold) compared to non-CSCs [36]. However,
it is unknown whether 4EGI-1 inhibits breast CSCs and
suppresses breast CSC tumor growth, and whether 4EGI1 interferes with translation selectively in breast CSCs is
elusive.
We investigated the effects of 4EGI-1 on breast
CSCs of HMLER (CD44high/CD24low)FA cells in vitro
and breast CSC tumorangiogenesis and tumor growth in
xenografted tumor model in vivo. We found that eIF4E1 is
significantly increased in breast CSCs comparing to nonCSC breast cancer cells. 4EGI-1 selectively inhibits breast
CSCs in comparison to non-CSC breast cancer cells. Both
4EGI-1 isomers repress breast CSC tumorangiogenesis
and tumor growth in mouse model. They inhibit cell

proliferation and increase cell apoptosis in breast CSC
tumors. 4EGI-1 selectively inhibits translation of mRNAs
of NANOG, OCT4, CXCR4, c-MYB, c-MYC and cyclin D1
in breast CSC tumors. These results suggest that 4EGI-1
targets breast CSCs through selectively inhibits translation
of mRNAs essential for breast CSCs.

RESULTS
Translation initiation factor eIF4E1 is enhanced
in breast CSCs
To investigate the underlying translational
mechanisms that are specifically required for CSC
character maintenance of breast CSCs (BCSCs), we
compared the cellular protein abundances of multiple
translation initiation factors by Western blot assays in
breast CSCs HMLER (CD44high/CD24low)FA cells and
multiple non-CSC breast cancer cells (non-BCSCs). We
found that eIF4E1 (also named eIF4E), but not eIF4E2,
eIF4G1, eIF1A, eIF2α, or eIF5, is significantly increased
in BCSCs, in comparison to SKBR-3, MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 breast cancer cells and non-BCSCs of HMLER
(CD44high/CD24low)SA cells (Fig.1A). eIF4E3 is hardly
detectable in all these cancer cells. These results suggest
that the activation of eIF4E-dependent translation is
enhanced in these BCSCs.

Selective inhibition of breast CSCs by 4EGI-1
comparing to non-CSCs
4EGI-1 consists of two isomers: [E]- and [Z]4EGI-1. To evaluate the effects of 4EGI-1, we synthesized
and identified an inactive analogue 4EGI-N(410E)
(Fig.1B). We compared the inhibitory effects of 4EGI1 isomers on breast CSCs and multiple non-CSC breast
cancer cells by ATP concentration based cell viability
assays. We observed that the IC50 of 4EGI-1 is about
30µM on SKBR-3, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer cells, about 22µM on non-CSCs, and about 11µM

CSC-depleted population of these breast cancer cells. We
treated the breast CSCs with 4EGI-1 isomers, an inactivate
analogue 4EGI-N(410E) and vehicle with series of
concentrations for three days followed by flow cytometry
analyses with CD44 and CD24 antibodies. 4EGI-1 isomers
significantly decreased the percentage of CD44high/CD24low
population cells and increased the population of CD44low/
CD24high cells (Fig. 2A-2B). 4µM [E]- or [Z]-4EGI-1
depleted most of breast CSCs. Importantly, inactive
analogue 4EGI-N(410E) did not affect breast CSCs under
the same conditions (Fig. 2A-2B). These results suggested
that 4EGI-1 potently depletes breast CSCs and promotes

([E]-)/10µM ([Z]-) on breast CSCs (Table 1). The above
data indicate that 4EGI-1 presents increased cytotoxicity
(>2-fold) to breast CSCs comparing to non-CSC breast
cancer cells, which is in agreement with the significantly
enhanced eIF4E1 in breast CSCs (Fig. 1A).

4EGI-1 promotes breast CSC differentiation
CSC maintenance and differentiation are important
for CSC tumorigenesis and tumor evolution[37]. CD44high/
CD24low is one of the defining characteristics of these
breast CSCs, whereas CD44low/CD24high represents the

not (Fig. 3B). HUVECs cultured on the surface of Matrigel
mixture with DMSO pretreated breast CSCs formed tubelike structures (33±2 tubes/HPF, high performance field,
20×), and 32.6±2.58 tubes/HPF with 4EGI-N(410E)
pretreated breast CSCs. In contrast, HUVECs only formed
4.5±1 tubes/HPF and 4.1±0.7 tubes/HPF with 8µM [E]and [Z]-isomer pretreated breast CSCs, respectively
(Fig. 3C-D). Importantly, 4EGI-N(410E) did not affect
HUVEC tube formation and HUVECs hardly form tubes
on growth factor reduced Matrigel (Fig. 3D). These results
demonstrated that 4EGI-1 inhibits proangiogenic factor
production in breast CSCs and significantly represses
breast CSC promoted HUVEC tube formation.

4EGI-1 inhibits breast CSC induced HUVEC
tube-like structure formation
Angiogenesis is the process of new vessel generation
and growth, which is important for tumor growth and
metastasis[38]. CSCs produce multiple proangiogenic
factors to stimulate tumor angiogenesis[39]. To examine
whether 4EGI-1 inhibits proangiogenic factor protein
synthesis in breast CSCs, we employed human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We pretreated breast
CSCs with compounds at the indicated concentrations
for 3 hours. Then, we embedded these breast CSCs in
50% growth factor reduced Matrigel (mixed with 50%
breast CSC medium MEGM) and planted HUVECs on
the surface of these Matrigel mixtures with endothelial
cell growth medium (EGM) (Fig. 3A). After incubation
at 37oC for two days, breast CSCs pretreated with
DMSO and inactivate analogue 4EGI-N(410E) grew into
tumorspheres, while those treated with 4EGI-1 isomers did

model in mouse. After the breast CSC tumor formation

4EGI-1 isomers 75 mg/kg/day (5 mice for each group)
by intraperitoneal injection (I.P.) for 30 days. Tumor
volumes were measured every three days. At the 30th
day, the average breast CSC tumor volume of vehicle
treatment was 237.4±18.6 mm3, whereas the average
breast CSC tumor volumes of [E]- and [Z]- isomer treated
were 113.2±11.4 mm3 and 123.9±10.8 mm3, respectively
(Fig. 4A). The average breast CSC tumor weights of
vehicle, [E]-, [Z]- isomer treated were 0.0825±0.01145g,
0.036±0.00618g, 0.038±0.0077g, respectively (Fig.

suppressed breast CSC tumor growth in vivo. Then, we

performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and
immunohistostaining with anti-mouse CD31 (vascular
endothelial cell marker) antibodies with breast CSC
tumor sections. 4EGI-1 significantly decreased vessel
numbers in breast CSC tumors (Fig. 4C), suggesting that
4EGI-1 inhibits angiogenesis in breast CSC tumors in
vivo. Next, we performed immunohistostaining to detect
cell proliferation marker Ki-67 and cell apoptosis marker
cleaved CASP3 (cCASP3) in these breast CSC tumor
sections. 4EGI-1 decreased Ki-67 in most breast CSC
tumor cells and increased cCASP3 in a few breast CSC
tumor cells (Fig. 4D), suggesting that 4EGI-1 significantly

4EGI-1 selectively inhibits translation that
persists in CSC maintenance and dissemination

inhibits breast CSC proliferation and can induce apoptosis
in breast CSCs in vivo. Furthermore, we found 4EGI-1
strikingly decreased cell proliferation key regulators
cyclin D1 and c-MYC in breast CSC tumor cells (Fig. 4E),
indicating that 4EGI-1 inhibits translation essential for cell
proliferation in breast CSCs.

To examine the 4EGI-1 effects on translation
essential for CSC maintenance and dissemination, we
performed Western blot with cellular proteins extracted
from these breast CSC tumors. 4EGI-1 treated tumor cells
presented decreased CSC pluripotency markers NANOG
and OCT4, tumor metastasis regulator CXCR4, EMT
mediator c-MYB and proangiogenic factor VEGF[40,
41], but not translation initiation factors eIF1A or eIF5,
comparing to vehicle treated breast CSC tumor cells in
vivo (Fig. 5A). Previously, we reported that 4EGI-1
inhibits translation of several oncogene mRNAs without
affecting their transcription in multiple cancer cell lines
at 24hr under normoxia and at 12hr under hypoxia
conditions in vitro[16, 32]. These observations suggested
that the indicated decreased protein levels in 4EGI-1
treated BCSC tumors were primarily, if not all, caused
by selective inhibition of translation of mRNAs encoding
these proteins. Importantly, we found that 4EGI-1 isomers
inhibit the eIF4E1-eIF4G1 interaction and increase 4EBP1 stability of binding to eIF4E1 in breast CSC tumor
cells in vivo (Fig. 5B). These results demonstrated
that 4EGI-1 selectively inhibits translation of mRNAs
encoding proteins that persists in CSC maintenance, proangiogenesis and metastasis.

DISCUSSION
Cancer stem cells are critical for tumor metastasis
and reoccurrence, which are the major resources of cancerrelated lethality. CSCs have acquired enhanced drug
resistance. Here we found that small molecule 4EGI-1
preferentially inhibits breast CSCs compared to non-CSC
breast cancer cells in vitro and effectively suppresses
breast CSC tumor growth and tumorangiogenesis in vivo.
4EGI-1 promotes breast CSC differentiation, inhibits
breast CSC tumorsphere growth and suppresses HUVEC
tube formation. 4EGI-1 significantly inhibits breast CSC
proliferation and can induce apoptosis in breast CSC tumor
cells. Furthermore, we found that 4EGI-1 selectively
inhibits translation of mRNAs encoding proteins that
are enhanced in CSC maintenance, proliferation and
metastasis, such as NANOG, OCT4, c-MYC, cyclin D1,
CXCR4, VEGF and c-MYB, in breast CSC tumor cells.
Our study suggests that selective translation initiation
interference by 4EGI-1 inhibits breast CSC tumor growth
and tumorangiogenesis (Fig. 5C).
Malignant cancer cells typically undergo extensive
adaptive genetic, epigenetic and metabolic changes to
support the heterogeneous malignant phenotypes, yet
cell survival and proliferation may dependent on one
or a subset of driver mutations[42, 43]. This continued
dependence on the driver mutation is deferred to oncogene

addiction[42]. Inhibition of the addictive oncoproteins can
lead to therapeutic intervention, which is the basis for a
considerable promise of current chemotherapy. However,
the followed tumor reoccurrence, tumor metastasis and
drug resistance suggest limits of using inhibitors targeting
one or a few addictive oncoproteins. Although it is known
that: 1) CSC quiescence decreases drug sensitivity; and 2)
CSCs may never acquire addiction to the oncogene that
drives disease development, the mechanisms of enhanced
drug resistance of CSCs are elusive[4]. Despite of the
extreme complexity of increased drug resistance of
CSCs[45], it is possible to target the CSC-specific adaptive
translational mechanisms that constantly produce proteins
to support CSC maintenance, self-renewal and metastasis.
Here, we found that translation initiation factor eIF4E1,
but not eIF4E2, eIF4G1, eIF1A, eIF2α, or eIF5, is
significantly enhanced in breast CSCs in comparison to
non-CSC breast cancer cells. We show that the eIF4E1eIF4G1 interaction inhibitor 4EGI-1 preferentially
inhibits breast CSCs compared to non-CSC breast cancer
cells, effectively suppresses breast CSC tumor growth,
selectively inhibiting translation of mRNAs encoding
NANOG, OCT4, CXCR4, c-MYC, cyclin D1, c-MYB
and VEGF, but not eIF1A or eIF5. CXCR4 and c-MYC
are addictive oncoproteins of many malignant tumors.
Therefore, 4EGI-1 both inhibits addictive oncoproteins
and interferes with the CSC adaptive protein synthesis
machinery in breast CSCs. These results not only
demonstrate that 4EGI-1 is a potential candidate for CSCtargeted cancer therapy, but more importantly, suggest that
the eIF4E1-eIF4G1 interaction is an available target for
the selective inhibition of CSCs.
It has been demonstrated that translation of mRNAs
encoding proteins important for cell proliferation and
survival is highly eIF4E1 dependent [15, 44]. Here
we show that 4EGI-1 selectively inhibits translation
essential for breast CSCs, including NANOG, OCT4,
CXCR4, c-MYC, c-MYB and VEGF. Data shown here
and elsewhere[32] have consistently evidenced that
4EGI-1 performs selective translation interference in
breast CSCs and multiple cancer cell lines. Here we show
that 4EGI-1 increases cytotoxicity to breast CSCs that
exhibit enhanced drug resistance to anti-cancer drugs of
Actinomycin D and Camptothecin (about 10-fold). This
suggests that 4EGI-1 can selectively target breast CSCs.
The intraperitoneal injection and suppression of breast
CSC tumor growth, and the low side effects on mice (data
not shown) in this study reflect the selective breast CSC
inhibition by 4EGI-1. In short, 4EGI-1 exhibits capacities
of both selective translation initiation interference and
selective breast CSC inhibition.
CSC maintenance facilitates tumorigenesis and
tumor reoccurrence[22], and CSC quiescence decreases
sensitivity to inhibitors[45, 46]. Furthermore, CSC
depletion reduces CSC tumorigenesis capacity. We
found that 4EGI-1 inhibits breast CSC maintenance
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and promotes breast CSC differentiation with decreased
CD44high/CD24low population and increased CD44low/
CD24high population cells. Furthermore, 4EGI-1 decreased
CSC markers of NANOG and OCT4 in breast CSC
tumors, which associate with hypoxia (low oxygen) within
solid tumors. These consistent results demonstrate that
4EGI-1 effectively promotes breast CSC differentiation
by selectively impairing translation required for CSC
maintenance.
Cancer cells have acquired capacities of
uncontrolled proliferation and apoptosis evasion[47].
We found that 4EGI-1 significantly decreases cell
proliferation, and c-MYC and cyclin D1 protein levels in
breast CSC tumors. 4EGI-1 can induce apoptosis in CSCs
within breast CSC tumors. These observations evidenced
that selective translation initiation interference may be
an avenue to effectively suppress proliferation in and
induce apoptosis into CSCs. On the other hand, targeting
CSC adaptive translation machinery may overcome:
1) inherent resistance to drugs targeting one or a few
oncoproteins, which is caused by CSC heterogeneity
and/or compensation of diverse/redundant oncoproteins
in a type of CSCs[41]; and 2) acquired resistance due to
mutations after drug treatment[48, 49].
We present here the first small molecule activities
against breast cancer stem cells through selective
translation initiation interference. Selective inhibition of
translation of mRNAs encoding proteins essential for CSC
maintenance, self-renewal, proliferation, differentiation,
and dissemination could be an avenue to restrict and
inhibit CSC activities, including CSC tumorangiogenesis
and tumor growth. Targeting selective translation initiation
is expected to overcome resistance due to mutations
acquired during drug treatment and the related inherent
CSC heterogeneity.

anti-β-actin antibodies were ordered from Cell Signaling.
Cancer cell lines of SKBR-3, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231
were ordered from ATCC. Anti-c-MYC and anti-cyclin
D1 antibodies were ordered from Cell Signaling.

breast CSCs or tumorspheres were taken by Nikon camera.
After aspiration of the MEGM medium, 4×104 HUVECs
were cultured into each well together with 0.3 ml EGM
medium followed by incubation at 37oC, 5% CO2 for 24
hours. Images of HUVEC tube-like structure were taken
by Nikon camera. The HUVEC tube-like structures in high
performance fields (20×) were counted. The experiments
were performed three independent times.

Tumor xenografted assay

Western blot assay

In the tumor xenografted assay, 1×105 breast
CSCs were mixed with 100μl Matrigel/DMEM mixture
(Matrigel: DMEM = 1:2) (BD Bioscience). Breast CSCs/
Matrigel/DMEM mixtures were injected into NOD/SCID
female mice (the Jackson Laboratory) mammary glands by
subcutaneous injection. After the tumor formation (about
75 mm3 in volume, 5 mice/group), DMSO, or 75mg/kg
[E]-4EGI-1, or 75mg/kg [Z]-4EGI-1 was injected into
the mice by intraperitoneal injection daily for 30 days.
Tumor volumes were measured every three days. At the
30th day, mice were sacrificed and tumors were excised.
Tumors weights were measured. Tumor tissue samples
were used for immunohistostaining, Western blot and
immunoprecipitation analyses. The mouse experiments
were performed according to the policies of Harvard
Medical Animal Committee.

Cellular protein extraction and Western blot assays
were performed as previously described with RIPA buffer
(50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X100,
0.1% SDS, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 1mM PMSF,
1×Roche complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail).
Immuno blots were performed with indicated antibodies.
All Western blot experiments were performed three times.

Cell viability assay
1 × 104 breast CSCs HMLER (CD44high/CD24low)FA
cells and other indicated breast cancer cells were treated
with DMSO, or [E]-4EGI-1 or [Z]-4EGI-1 at series of
concentrations for 24 hours. The cells were performed
cell viability assays with CellTiter-Glo® luminescent
cell viability assay kit (Promega) according to the
manual description. Three independent experiments were
performed. Average IC50 results were shown (mean ± SD,
t-test, two-tailed).

Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were statistically analyzed (mean
± SD, t-test, two-tailed). Statistical significance was
determined by t-test. Significance was expressed as: *: p<
0.1; **: p< 0.05; ***: p< 0.01, or with the p-value. P<0.05
was considered significant[2].

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
Breast CSCs were treated with the indicated
compounds at indicated concentrations for three days,
followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
assay with FITC-conjugated anti-CD44 (Biosciences,
G44-26) antibodies and PE-conjugated anti-CD24
(Biosciences, ML15) antibodies.
