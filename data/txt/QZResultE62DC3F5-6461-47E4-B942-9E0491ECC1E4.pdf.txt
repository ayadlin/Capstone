ABSTRACT
Despite progress in clinical cancer medicine in multiple fields, the prognosis
of pancreatic cancer has remained dismal. Recently, chemopreventive strategies
using phytochemicals have gained considerable attention as an alternative in the
management of cancer. The present study aimed to evaluate the chemopreventive
effects of resveratrol (RV) and apocynin (AC) in N-Nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amineinduced pancreatic carcinogenesis in hamster. RV- and AC-treated hamsters
showed significant reduction in the incidence of pancreatic cancer with a decrease
in Ki-67 labeling index in dysplastic lesions. RV and AC suppressed cell proliferation
of human and hamster pancreatic cancer cells by inhibiting the G1 phase of the cell
cycle with cyclin D1 downregulation and inactivation of AKT-GSK3β and ERK1/2
signaling. Further, decreased levels of GSK3βSer9 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and
cyclin D1 expression in the nuclear fraction were observed in cells treated with
RV or AC. Nuclear expression of phosphorylated GSK3βSer9 was also decreased
in dysplastic lesions and adenocarcinomas of hamsters treated with RV or AC
in vivo. These results suggest that RV and AC reduce phosphorylated GSK3β Ser9
and ERK1/2 in the nucleus, resulting in inhibition of the AKT-GSK3β and ERK1/2
signaling pathways and cell cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, the
present study indicates that RV and AC have potential as chemopreventive agents
for pancreatic cancer.

dismal. In Japan, about 27,000 patients are estimated to
have pancreatic cancer, and almost the same number of
deaths are attributable to this cancer annually [2]. Indeed,
the 5-year overall survival rate of patients with pancreatic
cancer is less than 5% [3]. The dismal prognosis is
attributed to aggressive local invasion, early metastasis
and low responsiveness to conventional chemotherapies,

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer is steadily increasing in incidence
and has a very poor prognosis [1]. Despite progress
in clinical cancer medicine in the fields of imaging
technology, surgical management and molecular-targeted
therapy, the prognosis of pancreatic cancer has remained

which indicate that efforts should be directed at developing
novel strategies such as chemoprevention to reverse,
suppress, prevent or delay the progression of pancreatic
cancer [4].
Chemoprevention by naturally-occurring agents
in plants, collectively termed phytochemicals, is gaining
much attention as a newer dimension in the management
of cancer. Many phytochemicals have shown cancer
chemopreventive potential in a variety of bioassay systems
or animal models which have relevance to human disease.
Resveratrol (RV; 3,40,5-trihydroxystilbene) which is
one of the promising phytochemicals, is a naturallyoccurring polyphenolic compound found in various plants
such as grapes and berries and in red wine, and has been
found to have broad spectrum beneficial health effects
including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer
activities [5]. Most of the evidence that shows cancer
chemopreventive effects of RV is well documented in
various cancers such as those of hepatocellular, lung, skin
and prostate by multiple regulatory mechanisms [6–9].
In vitro treatment with RV induced cellular apoptosis [10]
and inhibited proliferation [11] in human pancreatic cancer
cell lines, and significantly suppressed tumor growth and
enhanced the therapeutic effect of gemcitabine in vivo
[12]. However, the chemopreventive effects of RV on
early stage pancreatic carcinogenesis using an animal
model have not been reported.
Apocynin (AC; 4′-hydroxy-3′-methoxyacetophenone
or acetovanillone) is another potential anti-cancer naturallyoccurring compound. This phytochemical was identified as the
biologically active substance in the roots of Picrorhiza kurroa
Royle ex Benth, a perennial plant growing in the Himalayan
alpines. Extracts from the roots are used in the  traditional
Ayurvedic practice of India and Sri Lanka for the preparation
of ethnic medicines for the treatment of liver, heart, joint and
lung ailments [13]. AC disrupts the assembly of the NADPH
oxidase complex, which is the enzyme responsible for the
production of reactive oxygen species, therefore, inhibition
of this enzyme represents an attractive therapeutic target for
the treatment of many diseases such as those stated above.
Recently, several studies have reported that AC is also able to
inhibit tumor cell migration of breast cancer [14], and suppress
progression and carcinogenesis of prostate cancer [15, 16].
However, the chemopreventive effects of AC on pancreatic
cancer has not been established yet.
In the present study, RV and AC were used to
study the potential of these phytochemicals in the
chemoprevention of pancreatic cancer using the
hamster animal model. The N-Nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)
amine (BOP)-treated Syrian golden hamster model
exhibits many morphologic and molecular features
of human pancreatic cancer progression and has
commonly been used as an in vivo model in pancreatic
cancer studies. Recent studies have used the hamster
model for chemopreventive purposes in cancer using
drug regimens and for imaging purposes to detect
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

early pancreatic cancer [17–19]. In addition, several
studies using this hamster model indicated that a high
fat diet promotes pancreatic carcinogenesis [20, 21].
Therefore, we investigated the chemopreventive effects
of RV and AC on pancreatic cancer in BOP-treated
hamsters under the high fat diet condition. Further,
we used RV and AC as promising phytochemicals in
chemoprevention of pancreatic cancer, since they are
known to induce endogenous adiponectin [22, 23]. A
recent epidemiological study has shown that low plasma
adiponectin levels are associated with an elevated risk of
pancreatic cancer [24], therefore, this study also aimed
to elucidate the effects of adiponectin on pancreatic
carcinogenesis.

RESULTS
Treatments with resveratrol and apocynin have no
effect on clinical signs and levels of serum lipids
All animals remained healthy throughout the
experimental period. There was no significant difference
in the mean body, liver, kidney and visceral fat weights
among the groups at the end of the study (Table 1). During
the experiment, no significant difference was found in water
consumption among the groups. Histologically, there was
no toxic change in the liver and kidneys with administration
of RV or AC (data not shown). Blood glucose levels and
the serum levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, free fatty acid and amylase
are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Blood glucose,
total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were mildly
decreased in both RV and AC groups as compared to the
control group. However, these trends were not significant
among the groups. Serum levels of adiponectin were not
altered by treatments with RV and AC (Supplementary
Figure S1: control, RV and AC: 26.7 ± 2.2, 24.9 ± 2.5 and
25.3 ± 2.8 ng ⁄ mL, respectively).

Resveratrol and apocynin inhibit progression
of pancreatic tumorigenesis as well as cell
proliferation in BOP-treated hamsters
As summarized in Table 2, dysplasia and ductal
adenocarcinoma developed in the pancreas of all
groups, and there was no difference in the incidence of
dysplasia between the groups. However, the incidence
of adenocarcinomas in both RV and AC groups was
significantly decreased as compared to those in the
control group (control, RV and AC: 54%, 8% and 8%,
respectively, p < 0.05). The proliferative potential of
pancreatic ductal dysplasia was investigated by Ki-67
immunostaining (Figure 1). The Ki-67 labeling index in
ductal dysplasia was significantly decreased by RV and
AC treatments (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively).

Resveratrol and apocynin inhibit pancreatic
cancer cell proliferation and induce G1 phase
cell cycle arrest

cells. In order to investigate the regulation of cyclin D1
expression in pancreatic cancer cells, we used specific
inhibitors of the signal transduction pathways. AsPC1
cells were incubated with inhibitors of AKT (AKT
inhibitor VIII, 10 μM) and ERK1/2 (U0126, 10 μM) for 24
hours and analyzed by Western blotting for expression of
cyclin D1. As shown in Figure 3C, a decrease in cyclin D1
expression was observed in the AsPC1 cells treated with
AKT and ERK1/2 inhibitors, suggesting the involvement
of these pathways in the up-regulation of cyclin D1 in
pancreatic cancer cells.

To elucidate the mechanisms of anti-carcinogenesis
by RV and AC, we further explored the functional role
of RV and AC in cell proliferation of hamster (HPD1NR
and HPD2NR) and human (AsPC1 and BxPC3) pancreatic
cancer cell lines. RV and AC significantly inhibited the
growth of four cell lines in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 2A and 2C). Combined with the reduction of
cell proliferation by RV and AC in vivo, these in vitro
observations led us to examine whether RV and AC
modulate cell cycle progression in pancreatic cancer cells.
RV- and AC-treated HPD1NR and AsPC1 cells appeared
to accumulate in the G1 phase as compared to the controls,
with concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells in the
G2/M phase (Figure 2B and 2D).

Inhibition of cell proliferation is due to
reduction of nucleus-localized cyclin D1
expression through the pathway involving
nuclear GSK3β and ERK1/2
Next, to verify the subcellular localizations of
phosphorylated GSK3βSer9 and ERK1/2, we further
examined protein expression of nuclear and cytoplasmic
fractions in human pancreatic cancer AsPC1 cells by
Western blotting (Figure 4A and 4B). Phosphorylated
GSK3βSer9 and ERK1/2 were observed in both the nucleus
and cytoplasm of AsPC1, and those in the nucleus were
decreased by both RV and AC treatments in a dosedependent manner. Further, the expression of cyclin
D1 in the nuclear fraction was reduced, but not in the
cytoplasmic fraction. Immunocytochemical staining also
confirmed decreased phosphorylated GSK3βSer9 in the
nucleus in RV- and AC-treated cells (Figure 4C).

Resveratrol and apocynin decrease
phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 and reduce
cyclin D1 expression
To understand the potential molecular mechanisms
underlying the inhibition of cell cycle by RV and AC
in pancreatic cancer cells, we analyzed the signaling
pathways associated with cell proliferation using AsPC1
cells. As illustrated in Figure 3A, RV suppressed the
levels of phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-AKT (Ser473),
phospho-GSK3β (Ser9) and phospho-c-Myc (Thr58/
Ser62). Moreover, phospho-AMPKα and phospho-p70
S6 Kinase were highly expressed in RV-treated cells as
compared with the controls. Similar results were obtained
with AC-treated cells except for the expression pattern of
phospho-p70 S6 Kinase.
To further investigate the differential regulation
of these signaling pathways by RV and AC in hamster
and human pancreatic cancer cell lines, we performed
Western blot analysis (Figure 3B). Treatments with RV
and AC reduced the levels of phosphorylated ERK, AKT
and GSK3βSer9 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas they
promoted the level of phospho-AMPKα. However, no
change was shown at the Tyr216-phosphorylation site of
GSK3β in AsPC1 cells (Supplementary Figure S2). In
addition, we observed an effect of RV on Thr58 and Ser62
phosphorylation using separate and cocktail antibodies;
phosphorylation at both sites were decreased by RV
treatment. However, since total c-Myc expression was also
decreased, the ratios of Thr58- and Ser62-phosphorylated
c-Myc to total protein were not altered in RV-treated
cells. On the other hand, AC did not reduce Thr58/
Ser62-phosphorylated and total c-Myc, and this was not
reproducible result as compared to multiple phosphorylated
protein analysis (Supplementary Figure S3).
At the same time, the expression of cyclin D1 was
dramatically down-regulated in both RV- and AC-treated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Phosphorylated GSK3βSer9 expression in
the nucleus of ductal dysplasia is reduced
by RV and AC
We next analyzed the expression and localization of
these proteins in hamster pancreatic tissue. As illustrated
in Figure 5A, phosphorylated GSK3βSer9 was mainly
localized in the nucleus of dysplastic and adenocarcinoma
tissues, and the intensity in both lesions was significantly
higher than that in normal duct of control hamsters
(Figure 5B). The level of phosphorylated GSK3βSer9 in
the nucleus of dysplastic lesions tended to be lower in
RV- and AC-treated groups than that in the control group
(Figure 5C). In addition, the amount of phosphorylated
GSK3βSer9 was correlated with the Ki-67 labeling index
in dysplastic lesions in each group (Figure 5D). These
immunohistochemical data suggest that RV and AC
also control cell proliferation via modulation of GSK3β
activity during hamster pancreatic carcinogenesis.
To further verify that phosphorylated GSK3βSer9
expression in the nucleus is related to human pancreatic
cancer, we analyzed the expression pattern of
phosphorylated GSK3βSer9 in pancreatectomy specimens
(Figure 6A). We divided them into two groups according
to presence or absence of phosphorylated GSK3βSer9 in the

tumors. The clinical characteristics of all entry patients
are listed in Supplementary Table S3. In the analysis of
56 pancreatic cancer patients, 41 patients (73.2%) were
positive for nuclear phosphorylated GSK3βSer9. Moreover, a
significant correlation was found between the expression of
phosphorylated GSK3βSer9 in the nucleus and Ki-67 labeling
index in these samples (Figure 6B). These results suggest
that nuclear phosphorylated GSK3βSer9 has an important role
in the adaptation of pancreatic cancer to growth.

from natural sources, have received considerable attention
as cancer chemopreventive agents. However, there has
not been any report regarding the effectiveness of RV and
AC on the prevention of pancreatic carcinogenesis. The
present study demonstrated suppressive effects of RV and
AC on pancreatic carcinogenesis through regulation of
cell proliferation without any adverse effects in an in vivo
hamster model.
It has been reported that RV and AC induce
endogenous adiponectin [22, 23], which is an antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory adipokine, and its plasma
concentration is decreased in obesity [25]. Many case
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

control and prospective studies have shown that the serum
concentration of adiponectin is decreased in breast, liver
and colorectal cancers [26]. One prospective study reported
that low prediagnostic levels of circulating adiponectin
were associated with an elevated risk of pancreatic cancer
[24]. These observations suggest that adiponectin has a
protective role against cancer. Therefore, along with our
other goal, we simultaneously investigated whether or not
adiponectin inhibits pancreatic carcinogenesis. In contrast
to our expectations, analyses using ELISA and RT-PCR
revealed that serum concentrations of adiponectin did
not differ among all groups in the present in vivo study

(Supplementary Figure S1). Therefore, we could not
clarify the correlation between adiponectin and pancreatic
cancer. These findings suggest that RV and AC act as a
brake on pancreatic carcinogenesis in an adiponectinindependent manner.
RV has anti-tumor effects against various cancers,
including pancreatic cancer. Roy et al reported that RV
targets the Forkhead box O transcription factors through
the inhibition of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling,
and induces growth arrest and apoptosis in pancreatic
cancer cells [27]. Another study indicated that RV inhibits
proliferation and induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer
cells by targeting the hedgehog pathway [28]. These
findings are consistent with our in vitro study which
showed that RV induced growth inhibition and G1 arrest
in pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, a similar effect
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was also observed in ductal dysplasia and adenocarcinoma
in RV-treated hamsters. On the other hand, RV did not
induce apoptosis in pancreatic carcinogenesis in vivo
according to TUNEL assay (data not shown), although
RV induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro
(Supplementary Table S2). In addition, it is known
that the increase in cell proliferation can account for
carcinogenicity [29]. Hence, our results suggested
that inhibition of cell proliferation may be an essential
mechanism to prevent pancreatic carcinogenesis by RV.
There is a lack of data that demonstrates the
mechanism by which AC inhibits cell proliferation of
various cancers. Moreover, no previous study has revealed
an association between AC and pancreatic cancer. With
regard to the mechanisms of anti-tumor effects by AC
in pancreatic cancer, interestingly, we detected that AC

reduced the phosphorylation of AKT, GSK3βSer9 and
ERK1/2 which was also observed with RV treatment.
Further studies are needed to identify the molecular
mechanisms involved in more upstream target signaling.
These common pathways may contribute to cyclin D1
degradation because GSK3β and ERK1/2 are critical
regulators of cyclin D1 expression [30, 31].
GSK3β has various roles in cancer which even after
years of study remain complex and controversial [32].
Several reports showed that GSK3β is overexpressed in
various tumor types including pancreatic cancer [33].
In addition, a previous study indicated that GSK3β is a
potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer [34].
However, the evaluation of GSK3β inhibitors in clinical
trials has been hampered by the fear that inhibition of
GSK3β may stimulate malignant transformation [35]. In
the Wnt signaling pathway, active GSK3β phosphorylates
β-catenin at serine 33, which primes β-catenin for
ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated
degradation. Inhibition of GSK3β leads to the stabilization
of β-catenin, resulting in nuclear translocation of β-catenin
and promotion of transcription of β-catenin target genes
including cyclin D1 [36]. Although recent evidence
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggests that Wnt/β-catenin signaling may contribute to
pancreatic carcinogenesis [37], in the present study, we did
not find any significant differences in the phosphorylation
level of cytoplasmic GSK3β and subsequent nuclear
β-catenin by both RV and AC treatments (data not
shown). Another study indicated that GSK3β has a nuclear
localization sequence [38], and has also been shown to
play an important role in the determination of cyclin D1
expression level by directly regulating transcription and
protein degradation [30]. In addition, a previous study
reported that nuclear GSK3β promotes nuclear export
and proteolysis of cyclin D1, resulting in cell cycle arrest
in the G1 phase [39]. In concordance with previous
findings, our results showed that nuclear localization of
phosphorylated GSK3βSer9 and subsequent cyclin D1
expression were decreased by both RV and AC treatments.
Likewise, it has also been reported that GSK3β is required
for phosphorylation of c-Myc [40]. Our results indicated
that RV reduced c-Myc as well as cyclin D1 expression
resulting in suppression of cell proliferation, while the
phosphorylation of c-Myc was not affected by both agents.
At the same time, the connection between GSK3β and
K-ras is still obscure, although it is important to clarify
42971

Oncotarget

Animal treatment and biochemical analysis

this connection since K-ras mutations occur in more than
90% of pancreatic cancers. A recent study has indicated
that mutant K-ras-mediated signaling increases GSK3β
expression in pancreatic cancer cells by the MAPK
signaling pathway [41]. On the other hand, a previous
study on colon cancer cells reported that the K-ras
oncoprotein transactivates β-catenin via inactivation of
GSK3β [42]. However, this effect was dependent on PI3K,
but did not appear to require inhibitory phosphorylation
at Ser9.
Our results illustrated that the ERK as well as
the GSK3β pathways are related with the inhibition of
proliferation through the regulation of cyclin D1. It is
known that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is an important
determinant of ERK function. In quiescent cells, ERK
is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, and once
fully phosphorylated by MEK, ERK is released from
cytoplasmic scaffold proteins and rapidly translocates
to the nucleus [43, 44]. ERK1/2 activation has been
associated with pancreatic tumorigenesis [45], and
ERK promotes cyclin D1 transcription and assembly
with CDK subunits [39, 46]. On the other hand, another
study indicated that activated ERK1/2 upregulates
cyclin D1 expression through inactivation of GSK3β by
phosphorylation at Ser9 [47]. These differing findings
propelled us to further investigate the mechanistic details
of this pathway.
Collectively, our results clearly demonstrate that
RV and AC down-regulate phosphorylation of AKT,
GSK3βSer9 and ERK1/2, suppress cell proliferation,
and inhibit pancreatic carcinogenesis, without any
signs of tissue toxicity. Further, our findings provide
new information on possible mechanisms of action for
RV and AC in pancreatic cancer cells which involve
regulation of the subcellular localization of GSK3β and
ERK1/2. Thus, RV and AC warrant further attention
as promising chemopreventive agents for pancreatic
cancer.

A total of thirty-seven female hamsters at 6 weeks
of age received four subcutaneous injections of BOP (on
days 1, 3, 5 and 7) at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight.
One week after the last BOP injection, they were randomly
divided into three groups, and all groups were given a high
fat diet. The RV and AC groups were subsequently given
drinking water containing 200 mg/L RV or 500 mg/L
AC, respectively, for 10 weeks, and the control group
was provided water without any reagent. Food and water
were available ad libitum, and their consumption along
with body weight were measured weekly. At the end of
the experiment when the hamsters were 18-weeks-old,
all hamsters were anesthetized, and blood samples were
collected from the aorta. Visceral fat was assessed by
weighing total adipose tissues surrounding the uteri after
dissection. Blood glucose levels were measured using an
automatic blood glucose meter (Medisafe-mini GR-102;
Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). Serum were stored at −80°C until
being assayed for triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, free fatty acid and amylase
using radioimmunoassays by the Tohkai Cytopathology
Institute : Cancer Research and Prevention (TCI-CaRP,
Gifu, Japan). Adiponectin concentrations in serum were
determined by ELISA (R&D Systems, Inc, Minneapolis,
MN). All animal experiments were performed under
protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of Nagoya City University Graduate
School of Medical Sciences.

Histopathological examination
At necropsy, the pancreas, kidneys, liver and bile duct
were carefully examined macroscopically. Three anatomical
parts of the pancreas (the gastric, splenic and duodenal
lobes) were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin after
spreading on filter paper or frozen for RNA extraction. All
tissues were routinely processed, embedded in paraffin,
serially sectioned to 4 μm thick, and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) to assess the histopathological features.
Pancreatic lesions were histopathologically diagnosed as
dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. Dysplasia corresponds to
lesions in human that are referred to as PanIN1, 2 and 3. To
assess cell proliferation in dysplasia, deparaffinized sections
were treated with a Ki-67 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
1:100 dilution), and the proliferating cells were quantified by
counting the Ki-67-positive cells at a magnification of × 400.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals, diet and chemicals
Five-week-old female Syrian golden hamsters
weighing approximately 80 g were purchased from
Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan) and acclimated to the
laboratory for one week. They were housed three animals
per cage on pulp-chip bedding in an air-conditioned animal
room at 22 ± 2°C and 55 ± 5% humidity. All hamsters
were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions
with a 12-h light/dark cycle. The Quick Fat diet (crude fat,
13.6%; crude protein, 24.2%; total calories, 4.06 kcal/g)
(CLEA Japan, Tokyo) was used as a high fat regimen. RV
and AC were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO) and BOP was obtained from Toronto Research
Chemicals Inc. (Toronto, Canada).

Cell culture
Human pancreatic cancer cells, AsPC1 and BxPC3,
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Rockville, MD), and maintained in RPMI1640
(Wako Pure Chemical Industries Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
Hamster pancreatic cancer cells, HPD1NR and HPD2NR
42972

Oncotarget

[48], were maintained in DMEM (Wako Pure Chemical
Industries Co. Ltd.) supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells
were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2 humidified air. Cell
authentication (STR profile) of all human cancer cell lines
(AsPC1 and BxPC3) was performed by JCRB cell bank
on May 11, 2015.

phospho-p70 S6 Kinase, phospho-NFκB, phospho-IκBα,
phospho-GSK3β (Ser9), GSK3β, phospho-c-Myc (Thr58/
Ser62), c-Myc, phospho-Stat3, phospho-Jak1, cyclin
D1, Lamin A/C (Cell Signaling Technology), phosphoGSK3β (Tyr216), phospho-c-Myc (Thr58), phosphoc-Myc (Ser62) and β-actin (Abcam). Immunoreactions
were demonstrated by the ECL-Plus detection system
(GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) after 1 hour incubation
with secondary horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit
or anti-mouse antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). The
Western blot signals were quantitated by densitometric
analysis using ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare).

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was analyzed by the WST-8 cell
proliferation assay. AsPC1, BxPC3, HPD1NR and
HPD2NR cells were seeded into 96-well culture plates
at a concentration of 1.0 × 104 cells/200 μL/well and
incubated overnight. Cells were subsequently treated with
RV (0–200 μM) or AC (0–1000 μM). After incubation for
48 hours, cells were incubated for 2 hours with the Cell
Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol, and the absorption at 450
nm was measured with a microplate spectrophotometer
(SPECTRA MAX340; Molecular Devices, Kenilworth,
NJ). Cell viability was expressed as a percentage of
untreated control cells.

Clinical patients and pancreatic
cancer specimens
We used the computerized database of the institution
to identify 56 patients with pancreatic cancer who
underwent surgery between June 1997 and December
2009 at the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery,
Nagoya City University Hospital. The surgical specimens
were fixed in neutral-buffered 10% formalin, embedded
in paraffin, and processed for histopathologic diagnosis
and immunohistochemical examinations. This study was
approved by the institutional review board at Nagoya City
University Hospital.

Cell cycle analysis
AsPC1 and HPD1NR cells were treated with RV
or AC for 24 hours, then suspensions were prepared
and stained with propidium iodide (Guava Cell Cycle
Reagent, Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA) according
to the Guava Cell Cycle Assay protocol. Cell cycle phase
distributions were determined on a Guava PCA Instrument
using CytoSoft Software.

Immunohistochemical analysis of
phosphorylated GSK3β
For immunohistochemical analysis, deparaffinized
sections of hamster and human pancreatic tissues were
incubated with 1:100 diluted anti- phospho-GSK3βSer9
antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). Antibody binding
was visualized by a conventional immunostaining method
using an autoimmunostaining apparatus (HX System,
Ventana, Tucson, AZ). The intensity score of nuclear
phosphorylated GSK3βSer9 in each lesion was evaluated
using the Biorevo BZ-9000 microscope and the associated
software (KEYENCE, Osaka, Japan).

Western blotting
AsPC1 and HPD1NR cells were cultured with
RV or AC for 24 hours, and we used AKT inhibitor
VIII and U0126 (Calbiochem) as specific inhibitors.
Cell monolayers were rinsed thrice with ice-cold PBS
(Sigma) and prepared according to the extraction method.
To prepare whole cell samples, cells were dissolved in
100 μL of cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology,
Lake Placid, NY). For nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts,
trypsinized cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in
cell lysis buffer of the Nuclear/Cytosol Fractionation
Kit (BioVision, Inc., Mountain View, CA) and then
treated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Protein
concentrations were determined with a Protein Assay
Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Aliquots of
samples were fractionated by 8–16% sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then
electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The
membranes were then incubated with the following
antibodies: phospho-MKK3/MKK6, phospho-PLCγ1,
phospho-AMPKα, AMPKα, phospho-Erk1/2, Erk1/2,
phospho-p38MAPK, phospho-SAPK/JNK, phosphoBcl-2, phospho-PDK1, phospho-Akt (Ser473), Akt,

Statistical analysis
Differences in quantitative data, expressed as
mean ± SD, between groups were compared by one-way
ANOVA, Dunnett’s post-hoc test, Mann-Whitney U test
and the χ2 test as appropriate using Graph Pad Prism
5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA).
