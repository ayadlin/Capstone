causing increase in the cytosolic free calcium concentration. At
least 13 mammalian PLC isoforms have been identified and organized into six classes (h, g, y, q, ~, and D) based upon the
similarities in their structures and regulatory mechanisms (1, 2).
We and others identified PLCq as an effector of Ras family small
GTPases (Ras, Rap1, and Rap2), which bind directly to its Rasassociating domain (3–6). Subsequent studies have shown that
PLCq is also activated by small GTPase RhoA and heterotrimeric G
proteins Ga12 and Gh1g2 (6). These multiple regulatory mechanisms enable PLCq to mediate signals from a wide variety of cell
surface receptors, including receptor tyrosine kinases (7) and G
protein–coupled receptors (8). In addition, PLCq functions as a
guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rap1 by its CDC25
homology domain (9). The physiologic role of PLCq has been
intensively studied using various animals carrying artificial or
spontaneous mutations in its chromosomal gene. Positional
cloning of the gene responsible for a nephrotic syndrome identified
mutations in the human PLCe gene PLCE1 (10). Knockdown of the
PLCe orthologue in the zebrafish resulted in loss of the filtration
barrier in the glomerular podocytes resembling the human
symptom (10). Mice homozygous for the functionally inactivated
PLCe allele (PLCe / mice) exhibited semilunar valvulogenesis
defect, leading to cardiac dilation (11), and mice with total
disruption of the PLCe gene developed cardiac hypertrophy under
an extreme cardiac stress (12). Targeted inactivation of the PLCe
orthologue in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans resulted in
delayed dilation of the spermatheca-uterine valve, leading to
defective ovulation (13).
We showed that PLCe / mice exhibited marked resistance to
tumor formation in the two-stage skin chemical carcinogenesis
protocol using 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) as an
initiator and a phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
(TPA), as a promoter (14). PLCe / mice also failed to exhibit basal
layer cell proliferation and epidermal hyperplasia induced by TPA,
suggesting a role of PLCq in tumor promotion. As TPA is a
molecular mimic of DAG, a variety of DAG target proteins carrying
the C1 domains are potential effectors for the TPA-dependent
tumor promotion, such as conventional PKCs, novel PKCs, protein
kinase D, a and h chimaerins, Munc13-1f4, diacylglycerol kinases
h and g, and RasGRP1f4 (15). RasGRPs, also called CalDAG-GEFs,
are specific GEFs for Ras family small GTPases (16). The association
with DAG/TPA is sufficient for activation of chimaerins, whereas
phosphorylation by PKC is also required for activation of RasGRP3
(15). Although PKC isozymes have been most intensively investigated, their role in de novo carcinogenesis, including tumor
promotion, remains controversial. For instance, overexpression of
PKChII in the colon resulted in hyperproliferation and increased
sensitivity to carcinogen-induced cancer (17). In contrast, transgenic overexpression of a or y isozyme of PKC exhibited inhibitory
effects on tumor promotion with TPA (18, 19), and targeted
disruption of the PKCa or PKCg gene resulted in increased tumor

Abstract
In two-stage skin chemical carcinogenesis, phorbol ester 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) acts as a promoter
essential for clonal expansion of the initiated cells carrying
the activated ras oncogenes. Although protein kinase C (PKC)
isozymes are the main targets of TPA, their role in tumor
promotion remains controversial. We previously reported that
mice lacking a Ras/Rap effector phospholipase CE (PLCe /
mice) exhibited marked resistance to tumor formation in
the two-stage skin carcinogenesis. PLCe / mice also failed to
exhibit basal layer cell proliferation and epidermal hyperplasia induced by TPA, suggesting a role of PLCE in tumor
promotion. Here, we show that PLCe / mice exhibit
resistance to TPA-induced skin inflammation as assessed by
reduction in edema, granulocyte infiltration, and expression
of a proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1A (IL-1A). On
the other hand, the proliferative potentials of keratinocytes or
dermal fibroblasts in culture remain unaffected by the PLCe
background, suggesting that the PLCE’s role in tumor
promotion may be ascribed to augmentation of inflammatory
responses. In dermal fibroblast primary culture, TPA can
induce activation of the PLCE lipase activity, which leads to
the induction of IL-1A expression. Experiments using small
interfering RNA–mediated knockdown indicate that this
activation is mediated by Rap1, which is activated by a
TPA-responsive guanine nucleotide exchange factor RasGRP3.
Moreover, TPA-induced activation of Rap1 and PLCE is
inhibited by a PKC inhibitor GF109203X, indicating a crucial
role of PKC in signaling from TPA to PLCE. These results
imply that two TPA targets, RasGRP3 and PKC, are involved in
TPA-induced inflammation through PLCE activation, leading
to tumor promotion. [Cancer Res 2008;68(1):64–72]

Introduction
Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC) plays pivotal
roles in intracellular signaling by catalyzing the hydrolysis of
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two important second
messengers, diacylglycerol (DAG), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
(IP3). DAG binds to a number of its target proteins, represented by
protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes, and regulates their activities. IP3
opens calcium channels on the surface of the intracellular stores,

Role of PLCe in TPA-Induced Inflammation
Western blot analysis. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L
Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 250 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L

and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (24).

formation (20–22), indicating that these isozymes may function as
tumor suppressors. Such observations led to the reassessment
of the role of PKCs and suggested the involvement of non-PKC
molecules in tumor promotion (15).
The causal relationship between tumor promotion and inflammation, an old hypothesis, has gained substantial experimental
supports from recent studies (23). However, molecular and cellular
mechanisms mediating this relationship remain unsolved. In this
study, we show that PLCq plays a crucial role in TPA-induced
inflammation, which seems to account for its role in TPAdependent tumor promotion. PLCq is activated by TPA in dermal
fibroblasts, which is mediated by RasGRP3-dependent activation of
Rap1. Interestingly, PKC activation, too, is required for this Rap1
activation, the mechanism of which will be discussed.

Materials and Methods
Animals. Mice carrying the inactivated PLCe allele (PLCe ), created by
in-frame deletion of an exon coding for the catalytic X domain, were
generated as described previously (11, 14). They were backcrossed to
C57BL/6 strain eight times. PLCe+/+ and PLCe / littermates were produced
by cross-breeding of PLCe+/ mice and were used for the experiments. All
the animals were maintained at the animal facilities of Kobe University
Graduate School of Medicine. ICR mice were purchased from Japan SLC,
Inc. The use and care of the animals were reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Animal Committee of Kobe University Graduate School of
Medicine.
Antibodies and chemicals. Primary antibodies used here were
antimouse keratin 1 (K1; Covance), antimouse keratin 14 (K14; Covance),
anti-Rap1 (sc-65; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-actin (sc-8432; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-mouse Gr-1 (MAB1037; R&D Systems, Inc.),
anti–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; 9102; Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.), anti–phosphorylated MAPK (9106; Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.), anti–Pan-Ras (OP21; Calbiochem), and antivimentin
(ab7783; Abcom). Anti-PLCq antibody raised against the C terminus of
mouse PLCq was described (24). Secondary antibodies conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase were purchased from GE Healthcare. Fluorescently
active secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 546
were purchased from Invitrogen. A PLC inhibitor, U73122, and a PKC
inhibitor, GF109203X, were purchased from Calbiochem.
Preparation and culture of skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts.
Epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts were isolated from the
dorsal skin of 1-day-old to 3-day-old newborn mice and cultured as
described previously (25). The purity of the cells was over 99% as assessed
by immunostaining with anti-K14 and anti-vimentin antibodies for
keratinocytes and fibroblasts, respectively. For organotypic culture of
keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts isolated from wild-type mice were used for
reconstitution of the dermal equivalent as described (25).
Preparation of splenic B lymphocytes and non–B lymphocytes and
peritoneal macrophages. Splenic B lymphocytes and non–B lymphocytes
were prepared as described (26). Thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages were prepared according to the standard procedure. Briefly, mice
were i.p. injected with 3 mL of sterile 4% thioglycollate (Sigma). Four
days later, the peritoneal lavage was collected and, after removal of
fibroblasts through adherence onto glass plates, used as a macrophage
preparation.
Assessment of TPA-induced skin responses. The backside of the ears
of 8-week-old to 12-week-old male mice was topically treated with 50 AL of
50 Ag/mL TPA (P-8139; Sigma) dissolved in acetone. Ear thickness was
measured with calipers, and ear swelling was calculated as (thickness at
each time point) (thickness at 0 h). Histologic analysis with H&E staining
and immunohistochemical analysis of the skin sections were carried out
essentially as described (11, 14).
Reverse transcription–PCR analysis. Reverse transcription–PCR
(RT-PCR) was performed as described previously (11, 24). The sequences
of the primers used for PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

antibody. The level of c-fos mRNA was examined by RT-PCR after treatment
of the cells with the indicated concentrations of TPA for 2 or 6 h.

Measurement of cytosolic free calcium concentration. Cytosolic free
calcium concentration was monitored in cells loaded with acetoxymethyl
ester form of Fura-2 (Fura-2 AM; ref. 28). Dermal fibroblasts in culture were
collected by trypsinization and washed once with DMEM containing 10%
FCS and once with solution A [5.4 mmol/L KCl, 0.3 mmol/L Na2HPO4,
0.4 mmol/L KH2PO4, 4.2 mmol/L NaHCO3, 1.3 mmol/L CaCl2, 0.5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 0.6 mmol/L MgSO4, 1.4 mmol/L NaCl, 5.6 mmol/L D-glucose,
10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 200 Amol/L sulfinpyrazone (S-9509; Sigma)].
Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37jC in solution A containing 5 Amol/L
Fura-2 AM (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) and 0.02% (v/v) Plaronic F27 (P-3000MP;
Molecular Probes). After washing twice with solution A, the cells were
suspended at 7.5  105 cells/mL in solution A containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine
serum albumin and subjected to measurement of the emission at 510 nm

Measurements of Ras-GTP and Rap1-GTP. The cellular levels of RasGTP and Rap1-GTP were determined by pull-down assays using
glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions of Raf-1 Ras-binding domain
(GST–Raf-1–RBD) and RalGDS Ras-interacting domain (GST-RalGDS-RID),
respectively (27). After serum-starving in 0.1% FCS overnight, cells were
stimulated with TPA or vehicle for 5 min and lysed in magnesium lysis
buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet
P-40, 20 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 Amol/L leupeptin, 1 mmol/L PMSF], and soluble
fractions were collected by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were
determined by Bradford method, and 0.7 and 1 mg of the lysate protein
were used for pull-down of Ras-GTP and Rap1-GTP, respectively, which
were detected by Western blotting with anti–Pan-Ras and anti-Rap1
antibodies, respectively.

with the excitation at 340/380 nm using F-4500 fluorometer (Hitachi).
Fura-2 loading was confirmed by subsequent treatment of the cells with
10 Amol/L ionomycin followed with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Results are
expressed as relative concentrations of cytosolic free calcium calculated as
described (29).
Gene silencing by small interfering RNA. Dermal fibroblasts (4  106
cells) suspended in 1 mL of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) were transfected with
600 nmol/L Stealth small interfering RNAs (siRNA; Invitrogen) using
GenePulser (Bio-Rad) at 400 AF, 380 V. After electroporation, cells were
cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS for 48 h and subjected to further
experiments. The identification numbers of the Stealth siRNAs used
were MSS216065 and MSS216067 for RasGRP3 (abbreviated as grp65 and
grp67, respectively), MSS201244, and MSS201242 for Rap1A (a44 and a42,
respectively), and MSS210941 and MSS210942 for Rap1B (b41 and b42,
respectively). Stealth RNA interference negative control kit with Low GC or
Med GC (Invitrogen) was used as negative control.

which seemed several hours after application, was considerably
weaker in PLCe / mice compared with PLCe+/+ mice (data not
shown). Here, we quantitatively examined the extent of the skin
edema by treating the ears with TPA and measuring their
thickness. Histologic analysis of the ears, prepared 10 h after TPA
application, revealed marked spongiosis and extensive infiltration
of leukocytes in the edematous dermis of PLCe+/+ mice. However,
the extent of such changes was substantially reduced in PLCe /
mice (Fig. 2A). Examination of the time course of the ear swelling
in PLCe+/+ mice showed that the swelling reached a peak around
9 to 12 h after TPA application and started partial resolution
thereafter (Fig. 2B). In contrast, the swelling in PLCe / mice
showed a plateau with a moderate level around 9 to 24 h,
suggesting that the early peak phase of the edema, observed in
PLCe+/+ , was markedly attenuated (Fig. 2B). Calculation of the
number of infiltrated granulocytes in the ear sections 10 h after
TPA application indicated that TPA-induced infiltration of
inflammatory leukocytes was significantly reduced in PLCe /
mice compared with PLCe+/+ mice (Fig. 2C). These results indicated
that TPA-induced inflammation was attenuated in PLCe /
mice, suggesting the crucial role of PLCq in augmentation of
inflammatory responses.
Role of PLCE in TPA-induced expression of proinflammatory
molecules. Attenuated inflammation in PLCe / mice prompted
us to examine the expression of proinflammatory molecules at the
early stage of TPA treatment. We analyzed the expression levels of
representative proinflammatory molecules on the ear at 3 and
6 h after TPA application by semiquantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3A).
We found that TPA-induced up-regulation of interleukin-1a (IL-1a)
mRNA observed in PLCe+/+ mice was substantially attenuated in
PLCe / mice. IL-1a is a member of the IL-1 family cytokines
having pleiotropic functions, such as control of immune responses
and inflammatory processes (30). On the other hand, TPA-induced
up-regulation of mRNAs coding for the other molecules, including
cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a),
which are implicated in tumor promotion and inflammation
(31, 32), was unaffected by the PLCe background.
We next asked what kinds of cells in the skin are responsible for
this effect. Because TPA is thought to diffuse through the epidermis
to the dermis, keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and resident
leukocyte populations are candidate targets. Leukocytes became
the first to be ruled out because PLCq was not detected in
infiltrating Gr-1–positive granolocytes, B lymphocyte and non–B
lymphocyte populations, or thioglycollate-elicited macrophages
(Supplementary Fig. S1). This result suggested that keratinocytes
and/or dermal fibroblasts are responsible for the role of PLCq in
TPA-induced inflammation and led us to examine whether TPAinduced IL-1a up-regulation is recapitulated in keratinocytes
and/or dermal fibroblasts in culture (Fig. 3B and C). In dermal
fibroblasts, IL-1a mRNA expression was induced at 2 h after TPA
application, and this induction was significantly compromised
in fibroblasts from PLCe / mice (Fig. 3B). Expression of other
representative proinflammatory molecules was not significantly
affected by the PLCe background, except for macrophage
inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), whose induction by higher
concentration of TPA seemed to be attenuated in PLCe /
fibroblasts. In sharp contrast, the IL-1a mRNA level in keratinocytes was not altered by TPA or the PLCe background (Fig. 3C).
These results suggested that dermal fibroblasts, but not epidermal
keratinocytes, play a major role in TPA-induced and PLCqdependent up-regulation of IL-1a observed in the whole ears.

Results
Proliferative potentials of skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts
are not affected by the PLCe background. Our previous
observation on the crucial roles of PLCq in two-stage skin
carcinogenesis and TPA-induced epidermal hyperplasia prompted
us to examine its role in proliferation of skin cells in culture. We
first analyzed the expression levels of PLCq in primary cultured
epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. The keratinocytes
in culture were positive for K14 and represented the proliferative
populations residing in the basal cell layer of the epidermis.
RT-PCR analysis showed that PLCq is expressed much more
abundantly in fibroblasts than in keratinocytes (Fig. 1A). Western
blot analysis using anti-PLCq antibody detected two immunoreactive bands, which presumably corresponded to the splicing
variants PLCq1a and PLCq1b (12), and showed more abundant
expression in fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). These data are consistent
with our previous immunohistochemical observation that PLCq is
expressed more weakly in K14-positive proliferative keratinocytes
than in K1-positive differentiating keratinocytes (ref. 14; also see
Supplementary Fig. S1A). We next evaluated the proliferative
potential of keratinocytes and fibroblasts established from PLCe+/+
and PLCe / mice. We used the organotypic culture system, in
which keratinocytes were seeded onto the dermal equivalent
consisting of collagen fibers and dermal fibroblasts isolated from
wild-type mice and induced to differentiate by air exposure and
raise of calcium concentration in the culture medium (25).
Essentially, no difference was observed in their proliferation, as
indicated by the number of layers negative for K1, as well as in their
differentiation, as estimated from the number of cells positive for
K1 (Fig. 1B). Likewise, growth rate of dermal fibroblasts cultured in
the presence of 10% FCS was not affected by the PLCe background
(Fig. 1C). Furthermore, neither MAPK activation by TPA and
epidermal growth factor (EGF; Fig. 1D, top) nor c-fos induction by
TPA (Fig. 1D, bottom) was altered in dermal fibroblasts depending
on the PLCe background, suggesting that PLCq did not affect these
growth-promoting signaling pathways. Thus, PLCq did not seem
to directly affect the proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes or
dermal fibroblasts per se.
TPA-induced inflammation is attenuated in PLCe / skin.
TPA treatment is known to induce inflammation in the skin, and a
critical role of inflammation in tumor promotion has been widely
acknowledged (23). During the chemical carcinogenesis experiments, we had noticed that TPA-induced edema in the dorsal skin,

measured by increase in the cytosolic free calcium concentration
triggered by the PLC product IP3. TPA application induced rapid
increase in cytosolic free calcium, and this increase was totally
abolished by pretreatment with a broad spectrum PLC inhibitor
U73122 (Fig. 4A), indicating the complete dependency on PLC
activity. When TPA-induced calcium increase was compared,
PLCe / fibroblasts exhibited considerable reduction compared
with PLCe+/+ fibroblasts, indicating that a major part of the calcium
increase was accounted for by the activation of PLCq (Fig. 4B).
In contrast, ATP-dependent calcium increase, which is mediated
by PLCh, was not affected by the PLCe background, confirming
that no difference existed in the loading efficiency of Fura-2 AM
between PLCe+/+ and PLCe / cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, TPA-induced
cytosolic free calcium increase could be used as a good measure of
PLCq activation.
We next analyzed the upstream regulatory mechanism of TPAinduced PLCq activation. To this end, the activation statuses of Ras
and Rap1, two major regulators of PLCq, were examined in TPA-

we transfected the cells with two different combinations of

growth factors, which are shown to be directly or indirectly, via
stimulation of stromal cells, involved in the TPA-induced
keratinocyte proliferation and possibly in tumor promotion (37).
Thus, PLCq is likely to be involved in an initial phase of
inflammation, i.e. recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to the
site of TPA administration. Because PLCq is found to be not
expressed in leukocytes, including granulocytes, macrophages,
and lymphocytes, keratinocytes and/or dermal fibroblasts are the
possible sources of factors involved in this process. Search for
such candidate proinflammatory molecules has identified IL-1a,
whose induction by TPA is compromised in the skin of PLCe /
mice. Experiments using cell culture have shown that dermal
fibroblasts may be the main source of IL-1a induced by TPA in a
PLCq-dependent manner. IL-1a, as well as IL-1h, is a member of
the IL-1 cytokine family having pleiotropic functions (30). IL-1a
exerts its activity by binding to its cell surface receptors belonging
to the Toll-like receptor/IL-1 receptor superfamily (38). Binding of
IL-1a to its receptors induces recruitment of MyD88, TRAF6, and
protein kinases, including IRAK and IKK, leading to activation of
the nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)–dependent transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, KC, MIP-2, TNFa, and IL-1
(38). IL-1a also up-regulates expression of cell adhesion molecules,
such as VCAM-1 and E-selectin on endothelial cells and ICAM-1 on
mesenchymal cells, which are required for inflammatory responses,
including transmigration of leukocytes to the sites of inflammation
(30). Furthermore, it was reported that both epidermal hyperplasia
induced by TPA and tumor promotion by repeated treatment
with DMBA are suppressed by injection of anti–IL-1a antibody,
indicating a crucial role of IL-1a (39, 40). Thus, it is likely that
PLCq plays a crucial role in TPA-induced up-regulation of IL-1a
in dermal fibroblasts, which initiates a series of inflammatory
reactions in the skin. Also, our result has raised an interesting
possibility that the microenvironment facilitating proliferation of
the initiated cells may be provided by their surrounding cells
through induction of inflammation mediated by PLCq. Our preliminary study showed that intestinal tumor formation in ApcMin
mice was suppressed on the PLCe / background,1 suggesting
rather universal role of PLCq in tumorigenesis.
We have revealed that Rap1 plays a crucial role in mediating
TPA-dependent PLCq activation in dermal fibroblasts. Rap1
activation by TPA seems to be mediated by RasGRP3, which is
a DAG/TPA-regulated Rap1-GEF expressed in dermal fibroblasts.
Contrary to the previous reports that RasGRP3 is capable of
activating Ras, as well as Rap1 (15, 16), we have failed to detect
activation of Ras by TPA in our system; the reason for which is
currently unknown. Furthermore, PKCs are also found to be
required for TPA-dependent activation of Rap1 and PLCq. It has
been reported that certain isozymes of PKCs phosphorylate
RasGRP3 at its Thr133, and this phosphorylation is required for the
GEF activity toward Ras (15, 16). Although a similar mechanism
has not been proved with Rap1 as substrate, it may well be
involved in regulation of the Rap1-GEF activity of RasGRP3. This
is supported from a three-dimensional model structure of the GEF
domain of RasGRP3, which implies that the phosphorylation of
Thr133 plays an important role in a conformational change
enhancing its guanine nucleotide exchange activity (34). Thus, we
speculate that TPA may induce Rap1 activation in two ways:

cytosolic calcium increase and, hence, the activation of PLCq. The
loading efficiency of Fura-2 AM was not affected by siRNA
transfection, as no difference in the ATP-dependent calcium
responses was shown. These results showed that Rap1 plays a
crucial role in mediating the TPA-initiated signal, which leads to
PLCq activation.
TPA-induced Rap1 activation is mediated by RasGRP3 and
PKC. To make a connection between the TPA-initiated signal and
Rap1 activation, we focused on the DAG/TPA effector RasGRPs
(15). Dermal fibroblasts express RasGRP1 and RasGRP3 (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Among them, RasGRP3 was the most likely
candidate because RasGRP3, but not RasGRP1, is capable of
activating Rap1 (16) and RasGRP2 is unresponsive to TPA (33). We
therefore knocked down RasGRP3 expression by using siRNAs
and examined Rap1 activity in TPA-stimulated cells. As expected,
the knockdown of RasGRP3 expression by two different siRNAs
substantially suppressed Rap1 activation when cells were stimulated with a low dose (1 ng/mL) of TPA (Fig. 6A). However, this
inhibitory effect of RasGRP3 knockdown was overridden by a high
dose (10 ng/mL) of TPA (Fig. 6B).
We next examined the role of PKCs on TPA-induced Rap1
activation. One reason for doing this was because it had been
reported that RasGRP3 needs phosphorylation by certain isozymes
of PKCs for its GEF activity (15, 16, 34). As shown in Fig. 6C and D,
pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X potently suppressed not only the TPA-dependent Rap1 activation but also the
TPA-induced PLCq activation. This inhibition could not be
overridden by stimulation with high doses of TPA. These results
indicated that the TPA-initiated signal for Rap1 activation is
mediated by both RasGRP3 and PKCs.

Discussion
The causal relationship between tumor promotion and inflammation has been supported from the observations that tumor
promotion can result from exposure of initiated cells to chemical
irritant, such as phorbol esters, chronic irritations, and inflammation and that phorbol esters are strong inducers of inflammatory
reactions (23). This old theme has gained experimental supports
at the molecular level from recent studies using genetically
engineered mice. For instance, mice lacking TNF-a, a potent
proinflammatory cytokine, are resistant to skin carcinogenesis by
the DMBA/TPA protocol (32). Inhibition of inflammation by
pharmacologic or genetic inactivation of COX-2 reduced tumor
formation and malignant progression in mice carrying the mutated
Apc gene (31). The importance of innate immunity was also shown
by reduced tumor formation in the MyD88-deficient mice (35, 36).
However, intracellular signaling mechanisms mediating this
relationship remain largely unsolved.
In this study, we have shown that PLCe / mice exhibit
substantially attenuated inflammatory responses to TPA treatment
in the skin. Considering that the same mice exhibited marked
resistance to tumor formation in the two-stage skin carcinogenesis
and to TPA-induced basal layer cell proliferation and epidermal
hyperplasia (14), our results suggest that PLCq may be involved in
an intracellular signaling pathway linking tumor promotion and
inflammation. Because cultured keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts, which are free from inflammatory cells, exhibited no
difference in proliferation potential depending on the PLCe background, infiltrating inflammatory cells, whose number is reduced
in PLCe / mice, are likely to be the main source of cytokines and

Role of PLCe in TPA-Induced Inflammation

the signaling mechanism downstream of PLCq leading to the IL-1a
expression needs further clarification.
Our results raise the possibility that RasGRP3 may also play a
crucial role in tumor promotion by TPA. However, the role of
RasGRP3 in tumor promotion has not been studied, although mice
whose RasGRP3 gene was disrupted were already generated (45).
In dermal fibroblasts, we have detected a, y, and q isozymes of
PKC by Western blotting.2 However, a and y isozymes are thought
to be antitumorigenic (18–21), and the role of q isozyme in dermal
fibroblasts has not been well documented. Further studies on the
role of various PKC isozymes in Rap1-PLCq signaling will be
required for elucidation of the molecular mechanism linking tumor
promotion and inflammation by TPA.

through direct activation of RasGRP3 and through direct
activation of PKCs, which in turn phosphorylates and activates
RasGRP3. We have observed that stimulation with a high dose
(10 ng/mL) of TPA overrides the inhibitory effect of siRNAs
against RasGRP3 but not of the PKC inhibitor on Rap1 activation.
This phenomenon may be accounted for by postulating that
RasGRP3 activity is fully dependent on PKC phosphorylation and
that a high dose of TPA induces substantial activation of the
residual RasGRP, which survived the siRNA action, through PKC
activation so that the RasGRP3 activity reaches saturation.
However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other PKCregulated mechanisms of Rap1 activation may be involved in this
process. Because the actual concentration of TPA reaching the
dermis is totally unknown, physiologic implication of these results
is very difficult. The transcription of the IL-1a gene is under very
complex regulation involving not only NF-nB (41) and activator
protein-1 (42) but also DNA methylation (43). Although NF-nB
seems to be the most likely molecule involved in the TPA-induced
and PLCq-mediated IL-1a expression, we have observed no
alteration in the TPA-dependent induction of other NF-nB–
regulated genes, such as IL-6, TNF-a (38), and COX-2 (44). Thus,
