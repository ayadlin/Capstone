ABSTRACT
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a primary tumor arising from the serous
membranes. The resistance of MM patients to conventional therapies, and the poor
patients’ survival, encouraged the identification of molecular targets for MM treatment.
Curcumin (CUR) is a “multifunctional drug”. We explored the in vitro effects of CUR
on cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, pro-survival signaling pathways, apoptosis,
autophagy of human (MM-B1, H-Meso-1, MM-F1), and mouse (#40a) MM cells. In
addition, we evaluated the in vivo anti-tumor activities of CUR in C57BL/6 mice
intraperitoneally transplanted with #40a cells forming ascites.
CUR in vitro inhibited MM cells survival in a dose- and time-dependent manner and
increased reactive oxygen species’intracellular production and induced DNA damage.
CUR triggered autophagic flux, but the process was then blocked and was coincident with
caspase 8 activation which activates apoptosis. CUR-mediated apoptosis was supported
by the increase of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, increase of p53 expression, activation of caspase 9,
cleavage of PARP-1, increase of the percentage of cells in the sub G1 phase which was
reduced (MM-F1 and #40a) or abolished (MM-B1 and H-Meso-1) after MM cells incubation
with the apoptosis inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. CUR treatment stimulated the phosphorylation
of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, inhibited that of p54 JNK and AKT, increased c-Jun expression
and phosphorylation and prevented NF-κB nuclear translocation. Intraperitoneal
administration of CUR increased the median survival of C57BL/6 mice intraperitoneally
transplanted with #40a cells and reduced the risk of developing tumors. Our findings
may have important implications for the design of MM treatment using CUR.

is a multi-step process arising from genetic alterations
that drive the progressive transformation of normal
mesothelial cells into MM [4]. The development of
MM has been linked to the exposure to asbestos causing
random chromosome breaks [5]. Asbestos fibers can also
induce non-genotoxic damages, including the abnormal
activation of the AP-1/TNF-α/NF-κB autocrine pathway,
which increases cell survival after DNA damage and

INTRODUCTION
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a primary tumor
arising from the mesothelial cell linings of the serous
membranes, most commonly involving the pleural and
peritoneal spaces [1]. MM generally presents as an
epithelioid phenotype, although biphasic or sarcomatoid
phenotypes can occur [2-3]. Mesothelium carcinogenesis

investigated the in vivo effect of CUR on solid tumor
burden in mouse models of MM [26, 29]. Little is known
about the effect of CUR on signal transduction pathways
activated in MM cells and on the in vivo growth of MM
cells. Thus, it would be essential to further investigate
the in vivo effect of CUR in a mouse model in which MM
cells induce ascites in the peritoneal space.
In this report, we explored the in vitro effects of
CUR on cell proliferation, cell cycle regulation, prosurvival signaling pathways, apoptosis and autophagy
in human and mouse MM cell lines. In addition, we
evaluated the in vivo antitumor activities of CUR in
C57BL/6 mice intraperitoneally transplanted with mouse
MM cells inducing ascites.

promotes uncontrolled cell growth [6]. After the fibers’
damage to the mesothelium integrity, macrophages
are activated in an attempt to remove the fibers [6-8].
These events trigger a long-lasting inflammation, which
can enhance DNA damage for the production of free
radicals and inflammatory cytokines [9]. The long-lasting
inflammation caused by MM and the poor response to
therapeutics might be due to the ability of MM cells to
subvert host immune response [10, 11]. The knowledge
of MM pathophysiology might influence MM patients
therapy and survival [4, 12-14]. However, despite this
knowledge, the MM patients’ survival is poor, and was
slowly improving in the last decades [15]. Recently, the
application of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy
(HIPEC) and cytoreductive surgery, had increased
MM patients’ survival in particular for peritoneal
mesothelioma [12]. However, the therapeutic strategies
for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma
are referred to as ‘life-extending treatments’ [16]. The
drugs employed over the past decades have shown
poor response rate (RR), often no higher than 20%
[16]. The resistance of MM to conventional therapies,
and the poor patient survival following traditional
chemotherapy, have supported the identification of novel
molecular targets for MM treatment. Preclinical studies
have employed a second generation of drugs including
inhibitors of mTOR, folate, receptor tyrosine kinase and
ciclooxygenase [16]. Clinical trials have been performed
using chemotherapy with proteasome, mTOR and histone
deacetylases inhibitors [16]. However, although targeted
therapies improved the patients’ quality of the life and
survival and the new generation of folate inhibitors alone
or in combination with platinum derivatives, produced
encouraging results, the absolute RRs continued to be
limited compared to other tumors [16]. Accordingly,
since cancer cells show aberrant signaling pathways, it
might be important to employ compounds that are able to
target these multiple abnormally activated transduction
pathways. Polyphenols can be employed to inhibit the
growth of cancer cells due to their ability to downregulate or block the activity of multiple targets involved
in carcinogenesis [17-21]. Curcumin (CUR) CUR [l,7bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-l,6-heptadiene-3,5dione], is a non-flavonoid polyphenol found in the plant
Curcuma longa, widely employed as a food additive as
well as in cosmetic and herbal medicine in Asia [22-25].
Due to its ability to modulate the activity of multiple
targets involved in carcinogenesis, CUR is considered
a “multifunctional drug” [22-25]. Few reports described
the use of CUR to inhibit the growth of MM cells. CUR
induced cell death by pyroptosis in mouse and human
malignant mesothelioma cells [26]. Yamauchi et al.
reported that CUR induced autophagy in ACC-MESO-1
cells [27]. In addition, Mayol et al. reported that CUR
loaded PLGA-poloxamer blend nanoparticles induced
cell cycle arrest in MM cells [28]. Only two reports

RESULTS
Curcumin inhibits human and mouse MM cells
survival
The survival of human (MM-B1, H-Meso-1, MMF1) and mouse (#40a) MM cells was evaluated by the
SRB assay after exposure to increasing doses of CUR
(6.25-12.5-25-50 µM) or vehicle control (DMSO) for
24, 48 and 72 hours (Figure 1). The effect of CUR on
cell proliferation was dose- and time-dependent and was
significant compared with that of the vehicle control at
higher doses. CUR treatment of the MM-B1, MM-F1 and
the #40a cell lines for 72 hours was able to significantly
inhibit MM cell growth even at the lowest concentration
(Figure 1).
The concentration of the compound that inhibits
50% of cell growth (IC50) was also determined. The
concentrations of CUR required to reduce cell survival by
50% after 48 and 72 hours were 28.85 and 25.73 μM for
MM-B1, respectively; 22.21 and 18.38 μM for H-Meso-1,
respectively; 29.45 and 30.47 μM for MM-F1, respectively
and 33.13 and 40.92 for #40a, respectively (Table 1).

Curcumin induces reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generation in MM cells
One of the major detrimental effects of CUR
on cancer cells is its ability to increase ROS [30, 31].
To determine the effect of CUR on intracellular ROS
production, the DCF-DA assay was performed in
CUR-treated MM cells. The effects of the compound
were compared to those of DMSO and the results were
expressed as the mean of the fluorescence intensity (Table
2). CUR induced a significant dose-dependent ROS
production as compared to the vehicle in all MM cells.
ROS generation is supposed to cause DNA damage
that rapidly results in the phosphorylation of the histone
H2A variant (H2AX) at Ser 139 (γ-H2AX) [32, 33].
Treatment with CUR at the concentration of 25 μM for
30 hours led to a significant increased phosphorylation of

dependent on p62 expression. CUR induced a significant
increase of p62 in all MM cell lines as detected by western
blotting (MM-F1, p=0.004; MM-B1, p=0.02; H-Meso-1,
p=0.002; #40a, p=0.004) (Figure 3, Panel A). The increase
of p62 in CUR-treated MM cell lines was corroborated by
immunofluorescence analysis (Figure 3, Panel B). These
results indicated that CUR triggered autophagy but that
the process was then blocked as revealed by the increase
of p62.
Autophagy reflects the ability of the cell to adapt to
stress. However, if the stress is too powerful, the process
of autophagy is bypassed and apoptosis is activated [35].
The increase of p53 represses the autophagy and activates
multiple pro-apoptotic genes [35]. Thus, p53 and Bax/
Bcl-2 expression was analyzed by western blotting after
MM cells treatment with 25 µM CUR or DMSO for 24
hours. CUR treatment increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in
MM cell lines compared to DMSO treatment (MM-F1,
p=0.001; MM-B1, p=0.007; H-Meso-1, p=0.002; #40a,
p=0.01) (Figure 4, Panel A). In addition, CUR increased

cells
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the main
intracellular signal transducers sustaining autophagy
[34] whose activation can be revealed by the conversion
of LC3-I in LC3-II. MM cells were treated with 25μM
CUR or DMSO for 24 hours (Figure 3, Panel A). LC3-I
and LC3-II were constitutively expressed in DMSOtreated cells. CUR induced a significant increase of
LC3-I in all cells (MM-F1, p=0.0009; MM-B1, p=0.002;
H-Meso-1, p=0.002; #40a, p=0.03). However the increase
of LC3-I was not paralleled by a significant increase of
LC3-II except for MM-B1 cells (p=0.003) that showed
a significant increase of Beclin-1 as well (p=0.002). The
likelihood of cancer cells toward autophagy or apoptosis is

lines was assessed by the SRB assay after 24, 48 and 72 hours of treatment with DMSO or CUR. The percentage of surviving cells treated
with the compound was calculated by normalizing the O.D. value to that of the control cultures (DMSO). The results are expressed as the
means ± SD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate (xp ≤ 0.05, *p ≤ 0.01, #p ≤ 0.001 compared with the cultures treated

p53 expression compared to DMSO treatment in MM-F1
(p=0.012), MM-B1 (p=0.028), and H-Meso-1 (p=0.005)
cells (Figure 4, Panel A). The activation of the intrinsic
pathway of the apoptosis is sustained by the activation
of the procaspase 9 into caspase 9. CUR was able to
induce the activation of procaspase 9 in MM-B1 and #40a
cells as detected by the appearance of a low molecular
weight fragment of about 35 kDa, corresponding to the
active caspase 9. Moreover CUR decreased procaspase 9
expression in MM-B1 and H-Meso-1 cells as compared to
DMSO treated cells (ratio 0.64 vs 0.31 and 1.58 vs 0.52
respectively, p<0.05), thus suggesting the activation of the
molecule [36] (Figure 4, Panel A).
In addition, we determined whether CUR was able
to activate apoptosis through the extrinsic pathway as
well. CUR activated procaspase 8 as detected in western
blotting by the presence of caspase 8 cleavage fragments
(p43/41 or p18) in human MM cells (Figure 4, Panel A).
Finally, MM cells were labeled with an antiactivated caspase 3 polyclonal antibody after treatment
with CUR (25 μM) or DMSO for 24 hours or, as positive
control, with staurosporine (1 μM) for 16 hours. Figure 4,
Panel B shows a representative experiment. According to
activated caspase 3 positivity, the treatment with DMSO
had no effect on the induction of apoptosis in MM-F1
(0.006%), MM-B1 (0.006%), H-Meso-1 (0.004%) and
#40a cells (0.007%) (Figure 4, Panel B). Conversely, the

percentage of apoptotic CUR-treated cells was 46% for
MM-F1 (p<0.001), 29% for MM-B1 (p<0.001), 53% for
H-Meso-1 (p<0.001) and 34% for #40a cells (p<0.001).
Treatment with staurosporine resulted in apoptotic rates
of 85% for MM-F1, 79% for MM-B1, 88% for H-Meso-1
and 81% for #40a cells (Figure 4, Panel B).
Caspase 3 cleaves poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1
(PARP-1) thereby inactivating it and impairing DNA
repair and genomic integrity [37]. CUR-mediated cleavage
of PARP-1 was determined by western blotting (Figure 4,
Panel C). CUR treatment resulted in considerable PARP-1
proteolytic cleavage in all MM cells (Figure 4, Panel C).
To further corroborate CUR-mediated apoptosis of MM
cells, FACS analysis of DNA content was performed.
Figure 5 shows a representative experiment in which
the effects of increasing doses of CUR were compared
to those obtained with DMSO vehicle only. Our results
demonstrate that CUR induced an increase in the
percentage of cells in the sub G1 phase in all MM cell
lines at the higher dose (Table 3). To confirm the effect
of CUR in inducing MM cells apoptosis, MM cells were
simultaneously exposed to CUR and to the Z-VAD-FMK,
a universal inhibitor of caspases. Z-VAD-FMK was able
to significantly reduce CUR-mediated apoptosis in MMF1 and #40a cells and abolish it in MM-B1 and H-Meso-1
cell lines (Table 3, Figure 5). The increase in the sub G1
phase mediated by CUR was associated to the increase in

was found to be mainly localized in the nucleus in DMSOMM-treated cells. Conversely, CUR treatment induced the
accumulation of NF-κB in the cytoplasm of all MM cell
lines, thus indicating an inhibitory effect of CUR on NFκB nuclear translocation (Figure 7, Panel B).

It was reported that JNK is able to mediate activation
of NF-κB [39]. Thus, we determined whether CUR was
able to modulate NF-κB activation in MM cells. Treatment
with CUR did not affect the expression of NF-κB in MM
cells as revealed by western blotting analysis (Figure
7, Panel A). NF-κB functions as a transcription factor,
moving into its active form in the nucleus. To determine
if CUR treatment was able to affect NF-κB nuclear

C57BL/6 mice (6 mice per group) were intraperitoneally

alone. The treatment was performed once a week. To

monitor the growth of #40a cells which induced ascites,
the measurement of the abdominal circumference of the
mice was assessed prior to cells inoculation and then
every week. After 3 weeks of treatment, mice treated
with CUR showed a significant decrease in the abdominal
circumference compared to control mice (mean value 9.3
cm compared with 12.5 cm, p=0.0008) (Figure 8, Panel
A). At this stage, control mice were euthanized because
of the excessive size of their tumors. Conversely, 2 and
3 CUR-treated mice were euthanized after 4 and 5 weeks
of treatment, respectively. Only one CUR-treated mouse
was still alive after ten weeks (abdominal circumference
equal to 8.0 cm) when the experiment was completed. The
increase in the median survival of CUR-treated mice was
significant compared to vehicle-treated mice (p=0.0009)
(Figure 8, Panel B). The risk of developing tumors in
the corn oil-treated mice was 39.12 relative to the CURtreated mice (Table 4).
Overall, our results indicated specific interference
with intraperitoneally transplanted MM #40a cells growth
by CUR.

Thus, the local administration of drugs in the serous
cavity might be an improved strategy to treat MM [1].
Among the others, the polyphenol curcumin was shown to
inhibit cancer cell growth by targeting multiple signaling
pathways [24, 25, 29]. Clinical and preclinical studies
have been demonstrated that CUR administration is safe
[41]. The pharmacological potential of CUR is severely
restricted due to its short half-life, poor bioavailability,
low water solubility and absorption [42, 43]. Accordingly,
we evaluated the in vitro and in vivo effects of CUR
administration in MM cells. Our data demonstrated that
treatment of MM cell lines with CUR was able to in
vitro inhibit cells survival in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. The inhibition of MM cells survival was paralleled
by the increase of ROS intracellular production. CUR can
function as an anti-oxidant or a pro-oxidant drug [31]. Low
levels of ROS might induce cell proliferation and survival,
while increased levels of ROS might induce autophagy
and apoptosis by damaging DNA, proteins, and lipids
[44]. DNA damage rapidly results in the phosphorylation
of histone H2A variant (H2AX) at Ser 139 (γ-H2AX) [32,
33]. Our results demonstrated that treatment with CUR
led to a significant increased phosphorylation of γ-H2AX
in all the MM cell lines thus indicating CUR-mediated
DNA damage. Oxidative stress is also a potent inducer
of autophagy and apoptosis [44]. Thus, we next analyzed
the ability of CUR treatment to induce autophagy in
MM cell lines. Previous reports have demonstrated that
CUR induces autophagy in several cancer cell lines [45].
CUR treatment was able to induce an increase in LC3-II/
LC3-I ratio and autophagosome formation in the human
malignant pleural mesothelioma ACC-MESO-1 cell line
as well [27]. However, our results demonstrated that
CUR treatment was able to trigger autophagy but that the
autophagic flux was blocked as revealed by the increase

DISCUSSION
The poor bioavailability of anti-cancer agents at
the tumor sites affects the efficacy of chemotherapeutic
treatments. In addition, the majority of the anti-cancer
drugs does not achieve an effective concentration in the
tumor [40]. Intratumoral drug delivery might facilitate
the presence of a high concentration of the drug within
the tumor and avoid the onset of side effects. This
scenario becomes particularly interesting when the
treatment can be applied to outside accessible tumors,
including breast, head and neck, bladder cancers and
mesothelioma.

of p62/SQSMT1. p62/SQSMT1 is a scaffold protein
regulating signaling pathways involved in cell growth and
proliferation. The levels of p62 usually inversely correlate
with autophagic degradation [46]. Autophagy could be
a pro-survival response for different tumors after anticancer treatments [47]. However, if the intensity or extent
of cellular stress exceed the ability of the cells to repair
the damages, the autophagy is inhibited and apoptosis
is activated. Thus, autophagy often precedes apoptosis
after cancer cells treatment with chemotherapeutic agents
[35, 48]. p62/SQSMT1 is involved in the regulation of
apoptosis by activating caspase 8 [49]. When autophagy
is inhibited, caspase 8 dependent cell death is paralleled
by the increase of p62 in cancer cells [50]. Here, we
demonstrated that the inhibition of the autophagic flux
triggered by CUR treatment and associated with the
increased expression and cytoplasmic accumulation of
p62, was also coincident with the activation of caspase
8 which activates the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. The
activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway mediated
by CUR treatment through Fas receptor activation, was
previously established in other cancer cell lines [51-54].
Apoptosis can be also activated by oxidative stressinduced DNA damage, which activates p53 and different
signal transducers such as p38, ERK and JNK [55]. p53 is
a key regulators of the cell fate. DNA damage dramatically
increases p53 expression and activation and cell cycle
arrest and, if the DNA cannot be repaired, it activates the
intrinsic apoptotic pathway [56]. Our results demonstrated
that CUR treatment increased the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in all
MM cell lines by downregulating the expression of Bcl-2
and by upregulating the expression of Bax. In addition,
CUR induced the increase of p53 expression and the
activation of caspase 9, thus suggesting activation of the
intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Although p53 mutations
are rare in MM, the loss of p14 in MM cells might result in
the activation of the mdm2 protein and p53 destabilization
[57]. Thus, it is of note that CUR upregulated p53
expression in MM cells. We also demonstrated that the
activated caspase 3 cleaved PARP-1 thus corroborating
that the inhibition of cell survival exerted by CUR
treatment is mainly mediated by apoptosis. This result
was corroborated by the incubation of MM cell lines with
the specific inhibitor of apoptosis Z-VAD-FMK. Indeed,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Z-VAD-FMK was able to significantly reduce and in MMB1 and H-Meso-1 cell lines abolish the CUR-mediated
MM cells apoptosis.
Some natural compounds, including resveratrol,
quercetin and apigenin, require MAPKs activation,
in particular ERK1/2 activation, for the induction of
apoptosis [58]. In addition, oxidative stress is responsible
for activation of MAPKs and p38 is important for ROSmediated apoptosis [59]. Our results demonstrated that
CUR treatment stimulated the phosphorylation of both
ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK in all the examined MM cell
lines. Of note, CUR inhibited p54 JNK phosphorylation
while that of p46 JNK was only partly affected in
H-Meso-1 and #40a cell lines. In addition, CUR inhibited
AKT phosphorylation and NF-κB nuclear translocation.
CUR inhibition of NF-κB and AKT signaling could
prevent pro-survival signals thus inducing apoptosis [60].
It was reported that treatment of malignant pleural MM
cell lines with butein interfered with the stability of the
STAT3-NF-κB and decreased chemoresistance in vitro and
in vivo [61, 62]. AKT activation has been demonstrated
in malignant pleural mesothelioma specimens and PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors significantly suppressed malignant
pleural mesothelioma cell growth [63].
CUR-mediated apoptosis was dependent on JNK
and p38 activation in colon cancer cell lines [64]. JNK
and p38 may function in a cell type-specific manner to
modulate intracellular signals that regulate proliferation,
differentiation, survival and death. JNK and p38 can
have antagonist effects. p38 activation is normally
associated with anti-proliferative functions and in some
cases can negatively regulate JNK activity in different
cell types [65]. Recent studies have shown that p38 and
JNK have a key role in the crosstalk between autophagy
and apoptosis induced by DNA damage [66]. Moreover,
it has been reported that JNK activation stimulates the
autophagy by interfering with Bcl-2/Beclin interaction
and that the pharmacological inhibition of JNK causes
accumulation of p62 and reduces the LC3II/LC3I ratio
flux and activates caspase 3. In particular, p54 JNK
phosphorylation may support cell survival during
cellular stress, while viral infections such as Kaposi
sarcoma-associated herpes virus infections are able
to inhibit p54 JNK phosphorylation, thus inhibiting
34415

autophagy and reducing cell survival [67-69]. In
agreement with these results, the inhibition of p54 JNK
phosphorylation by CUR further supports the block
of the autophagic flux and the induction of apoptosis
in MM cells. CUR-mediated activation and then
impairment of autophagy and activation of apoptosis
observed in MM cell lines could be due to the activation
of ERK1/2 and p38 signaling, the last items responsible
for the JNK inhibition.
c-Jun is an early response transcription factor that
can be induced by DNA damage. Indeed, ERK activation
is able to increase the expression of c-Jun by enhancing its
stability. Phosphorylation of c-Jun is mainly mediated by
JNK, but alternative pathways for c-Jun activation have
been described [70, 71]. CUR increased the expression
and phosphorylation of c-Jun in MM cells despite the
inhibition of JNK, thus suggesting the activation of
an alternative pathway for c-Jun phosphorylation. The
increased expression of c-Jun upon CUR treatment might
be due to activation of ERK [70].
Few studies have analysed the in vivo effect of
CUR on MM cells growth. Miller et al. reported that
daily oral administration of CUR via gavage (500 mg/
kg and 2 g/kg) or three intraperitoneal injections of CUR
(100-200 mg/kg) were not able to reduce the growth of
#40 cells growing as a solid tumor in the peritoneal
cavity [26]. Wang et al. analyzed the effect of daily
administration of 500 mg/kg CUR by oral gavage in
BALB/c mice subcutaneously inoculated with AB12 MM
cells. They showed that CUR administration suppressed
solid tumor growth [29]. Here, we demonstrated that
the intraperitoneal administration of CUR reduced
peritoneal #40a cells growth in C57BL/6 mice. The #40a
cell line, when transplanted in the peritoneal cavity, is

able to reproducibly induce ascites in C57BL/6 mice.
Thus, the effect of CUR administration was revealed
by measuring the abdominal circumference of the mice.
Overall, the risk of developing tumors in the corn oil
treated mice was 39.12 in comparison to those treated
with 75 mg/kg CUR one time per week. In addition, the
increase in the median survival of mice administered
with CUR was superior to that of mice receiving corn
oil. MM is an aggressive tumor. The ability of CUR to
in vivo interfere with MM cell growth might offer an
additional tool for MM treatment. The administration
of CUR in the peritoneal space allows the increase of
CUR concentration to which cancer cells are exposed. In
addition, CUR is able to modulate the immune response
[72]. Thus, CUR might potentiate mice immune
response against MM cells.
Overall, the in vitro and in vivo effects of CUR on
MM cells are summarized in Figure 9.
Several in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies
have brought CUR to clinical trials and its safety and
efficacy has been tested and proved for using it as a
chemopreventive agent or to be used in combination
with the conventional chemotherapy [73]. The
possibility of administering CUR directly to the tumor
site could avoid the poor CUR bioavailability and
potential side effects. MM patients survival is poor,
although standard therapy and the incidence of MM is
expected to increase in the near future. The possibility
of using CUR, analogs of CUR or formulations of
CUR with slower release of the compound at the tumor
site could improve the delivery of the compound. Our
findings may have important implications for the
design of MM treatment using CUR in addition to
other drugs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

72 hours at concentrations of 6.25-12.5-25-50 µM. The
cells were then fixed with cold trichloroacetic acid (final
concentration 10%) for 1 hour at 4°C. After 4 washes with
distilled water, the plates were air-dried and stained for
30 min with 0.4% (wt/vol) SRB in 1% acetic acid. After
4 washes with 1% acetic acid to remove the unbound
dye, the plates were air-dried, and cell-bound SRB was
dissolved with 200 µl/well of 10 mM unbuffered Tris base
solution. The optical density (O.D.) of the samples was
determined at 540 nm with a spectrophotometric plate
reader. The percentage survival of the cultures treated with
CUR was calculated by normalizing their O.D. values to
those of control cultures treated with DMSO [20]. The
experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated
three times.

Reagents
DMSO, Curcumin (CUR), Sulforhodamine B
(SRB), Hoechst 33342, DAPI and Pristane (2,6,10,14-Te
tramethylpentadecane) were purchased from Sigma
Aldrich (Milano, Italy). Z-VAD-FMK was purchased
from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA). Antibodies
against AKT, phospho-AKT, p38 and phospho-p38,
JNK and phospho-JNK, caspase 9, caspase 8, activated
caspase 3, c-Jun and phospho-c-Jun were obtained from
Cell Signaling Technology (MA, USA). Antibodies
against Bax, Bcl-2 and γ-H2AX were obtained from
BD Pharmigen (BD Biosciences, CA, USA). Antibodies
against p53, PARP-1, ERK1/2 (C-14), phosphoERK (E-4), NF-κB (p65) were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA). Antibodies against
Beclin-1 and p62/SQSTM1 were obtained from Abcam
(Cambridge, UK) and the anti-LC3 antibody was
purchased from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO,
USA). Goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa fluor-594-conjugated
and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa fluor-488-conjugated
secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen
(Milano, Italy). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against
actin and tubulin and goat anti-mouse or the anti-rabbit
IgG peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

Fluorescent measurement of ROS
Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCF-DA) was used
to detect ROS production in MM cells. Briefly, 2.5×105
cells were seeded into 6-well plates and incubated at
37 °C to allow cells attachment before treatment. After
two washings with PBS, cells were incubated with 10
μM 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Sigma-Aldrich,
Milan, Italy) in PBS at 37°C and 5% CO2 in the dark for
30 min [76]. After two washings, cells were treated with
CUR (6.25-50 µM) or DMSO in serum-free medium and
incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 in the dark for different
times (15 min-4 hours). Then, adherent and suspended
cells were harvested, centrifuged at 1250 rpm for 10
min, and seeded in 96-well plates (100 μl per well).
Fluorescence intensity was measured after 15 and 30
min and after 1 and 4 hours using a spectrophotometric
plate reader at an excitation wavelength of 495 nm and an
emission wavelength of 535 nm. Because the highest level
of fluorescence was detected at 30 min and it decreased
back to the level of the control after 1 hour of CUR
stimulation (data not shown), this experimental time was
chosen for subsequent experiments.

Cell lines and treatments
Human (MM-B1, H-Meso-1, MM-F1) and mouse
(40 and #40a) MM cell lines were maintained in DMEM
(Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml
streptomycin (complete medium). The cells were grown
at 37°C in a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of
5% CO2. The #40a cell line derives from the 40 cell line
after two passages in the peritoneal cavity of C57BL/6
mice. These passages allow the selection of cells which
reproducibly form ascites when intraperitoneally
injected in the mice. H-Meso-1 cells have an epithelial
morphology, while MM-B1 and MM-F1 cells have
biphasic and sarcomatous features, respectively [74]. The
40 cell line has an epithelial morphology [75].
CUR was dissolved in DMSO. For the treatments,
the cells were incubated for the indicated times in the
presence of CUR (dose range: 6.25-50 µM) or the vehicle
(DMSO ≤ 0.1%).

FACS analysis
Asynchronized, log-phase growing cells (60%
confluent, approximately 2.5x105/well in 6-well plates)
were treated with CUR (6.25-12.5-25 µM) or DMSO in
complete culture medium. Z-VAD-FMK was used at a
final concentration of 40 µM for 2 hours before addition
of CUR treatment. After 48 hours adherent as well as
suspended cells were harvested, centrifuged at 1500 rpm
for 10 min and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). The cell pellets were re-suspended in 70%
ethanol and incubated for 1 hour at -20°C. The cells were
then washed twice with cold PBS, centrifuged at 1500
rpm for 10 min, incubated for 1 hour in the dark with
propidium iodide (25 μg/ml final concentration in 0.1%
citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100) and analyzed by flow

Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay
Cells were seeded at 5x103/well in 96-well plates
and incubated at 37°C to allow cell attachment. After 24
hours, the medium was changed and the cells were treated
with CUR or DMSO and incubated for 24 hours, 48 hours,

mesothelioma 40 cell line was previously described
by Goodglick et al. [75]. The #40a cell line is derived
from the 40 cell line after two passages in the peritoneal
cavity following administration of pristane one week
before cell transplant. The intraperitoneal injection
of a mineral oil such as pristane was shown to induce
inflammation in mice [80].
Investigation has been conducted in accordance
with the ethical standards and according to the
Declaration of Helsinki. A veterinary surgeon was
present during the experiments. The animal care both
before and after the experiments was performed only
by trained personnel. Mice were bred under pathogenfree conditions in the animal facilities of the University
of Rome “Tor Vergata” and handled in compliance
with European Union and institutional standards for
animal research. The work was conducted with the
formal approval of the local animal care committees
(institutional and national), and animal experiments have
been registered as legislation requires (Authorization
from Ministry of Health n° 187/2016-PR).

Preparation of cell lysates and western blotting
Approximately 1x106 cells were seeded in 100-mm
tissue culture dishes 24 hours prior to the addition of 25
μM CUR or vehicle. After 24 hours of incubation, the cells
were harvested, washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in
RIPA lysis buffer (Triton X-100 1%, SDS 0.1%, NaCl 200
mM, Tris HCl 50 mM pH 7.5, PMSF 1 mM, and NaOV 1
mM). After 30 min at 4°C, the mixtures were centrifuged
at 12000 g for 15 min and the supernatants were analyzed
by western blotting. For western blotting analysis, 50 μg
of cell lysates were resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE and then
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking,
the membranes were incubated with specific primary
antibodies at 1-2 μg/ml concentrations overnight at 4°C.
After being washed, the filters were incubated with goat
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase-conjugated
antibodies and developed by chemiluminescence as
previously described [78]. A densitometric analysis of
autoradiographic bands was performed with Image J
software (National Institutes of Health, USA) after blot
scanning.

Analysis of antitumor activity in vivo
#40a cells growth in the peritoneum induces ascites.
Accordingly, the abdominal circumference of mice was
monitored before the inoculation of cells and every week
until tumor-bearing mice were euthanized at the first
signs of distress or when their abdominal circumference
exceeded 12 cm.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were seeded at 4x104 cells/well in 8-well
chamber slides and, after 24 hours, they were treated with
25 μM CUR, or with the vehicle. After 24 hours, the cells
were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, washed and
fixed in methanol for 5 min at -20°C, then washed again
and incubated with specific primary antibodies for 1 hour
at room temperature. After additional washings, the cells
were labeled with a goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa fluor-594conjugated and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa fluor-488conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min [79]. After
a third washing, the cells were incubated with 0.1 μg/
ml Hoechst 33342 and mounted under a cover slip with
glycerol. The cells were observed with an Olympus BX51
microscope.

Statistical analysis
The data distribution of cell survival and the FACS
analyses were preliminarily verified by KolmogorovSmirnov test, and data sets were analyzed by one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by NewmanKeuls test. Differences in the intensity of immunoreactive
bands were evaluated by a two-tailed Student’s t-test.
Values with p≤ 0.05 were considered significant. Survival
curves and tumor volumes were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method and compared with a log-rank
test (Mantel-Cox). Differences in tumor volumes were
regarded as significant when the p value was ≤0.05 [81].
