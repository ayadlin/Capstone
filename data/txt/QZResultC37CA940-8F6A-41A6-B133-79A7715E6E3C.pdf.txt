Abstract
Human tumor vessels express tumor vascular markers (TVM), proteins that are not expressed in normal
blood vessels. Antibodies targeting TVMs could act as potent therapeutics. Unfortunately, preclinical in vivo
studies testing anti-human TVM therapies have been difﬁcult to do due to a lack of in vivo models with
conﬁrmed expression of human TVMs. We therefore evaluated TVM expression in a human embryonic stem
cell–derived teratoma (hESCT) tumor model previously shown to have human vessels. We now report that in
the presence of tumor cells, hESCT tumor vessels express human TVMs. The addition of mouse embryonic
ﬁbroblasts and human tumor endothelial cells signiﬁcantly increases the number of human tumor vessels.
TVM induction is mostly tumor-type–speciﬁc with ovarian cancer cells inducing primarily ovarian TVMs,
whereas breast cancer cells induce breast cancer speciﬁc TVMs. We show the use of this model to test an antihuman speciﬁc TVM immunotherapeutics; anti-human Thy1 TVM immunotherapy results in central tumor
necrosis and a three-fold reduction in human tumor vascular density. Finally, we tested the ability of the
hESCT model, with human tumor vascular niche, to enhance the engraftment rate of primary human ovarian
cancer stem–like cells (CSC). ALDHþ CSC from patients (n ¼ 6) engrafted in hESCT within 4 to 12 weeks
whereas none engrafted in the ﬂank. ALDH ovarian cancer cells showed no engraftment in the hESCT or
ﬂank (n ¼ 3). Thus, this model represents a useful tool to test anti-human TVM therapy and evaluate in vivo
human CSC tumor biology. Cancer Res; 73(12); 3555–65. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The tumor vasculature expresses numerous genes not
expressed in normal vasculature (1–5). This is, in part, due to
the increased expression of genes associated with physiologic
angiogenesis, as many tumor vascular antigens are also upregulated in angiogenic tissues (1, 6, 7). However, if the angiogenic signature is the primary difference between tumor
vasculature and normal vasculature, one might anticipate a
signiﬁcant overlap between vascular proﬁles of different tumor
types. Indeed this is not the case; the vascular expression
proﬁle of different tumor types appears to be distinct
(3, 5, 7–10). This is consistent with murine studies suggesting
physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis have distinct gene
signatures (6) and indicates that the inﬂuence of the cancer cell

on the tumor microenvironment may play a role in the
induction of tumor speciﬁc vascular proteins.
Tumor vascular markers (TVM), antigens speciﬁcally
expressed in tumor vessels and not expressed in normal
vessels, represent a potentially important therapeutic target.
In particular, those with extracellular exposure are ideal targets for immunotherapeutics (2, 10–12). As therapeutic targets,
TVMs would be accessible to drug, and the restricted nature of
TVM expression should limit therapy-associated side effects
on normal tissues. Proof-of-principle studies in rodents
showed the potency of tumor vascular–targeted therapy.
Immunotherapeutics targeting a tumor vascular–speciﬁc
splice variant of ﬁbronectin showed profound restriction of
tumor growth (13). More recently, antibodies targeting the
anthrax receptor (Tem8) have been shown to speciﬁcally
inhibit pathologic angiogenesis and restrict tumor growth
(14, 15). Phase I clinical trials using an immunotherapeutic
targeting the TVM FOLH1 suggest that antitumor vascular
immunotherapeutics are safe and potentially efﬁcacious (16).
Broader development of anti-TVM therapies has been hindered by the absence of an experimental system with conﬁrmed human TVM expression with which to test potential
therapies. Most mouse tumor models generate murine vessels
and therefore cannot be used to test antibodies speciﬁc to
human antigens. While models of human tumor vasculature
have been proposed, these models have been difﬁcult to
reproduce, have limited long-term viability, and/or do not
have conﬁrmed expression of TVMs (17–19).

Beyond their role in providing nutrients to the tumor, tumor
vascular cells are also a critical host component of the cancer
stem–like cell (CSC) niche. Vascular cells receive angiogenic
cues from CSCs and in turn provide CSCs with critical survival,
proliferation, and differentiation signals (20). Thus, a model
with robust human tumor vasculature could enhance the
in vivo study of human CSCs, which have been surprisingly
difﬁcult to engraft in mice. The difﬁculty engrafting human
CSCs in mice could be related to differences in the murine and
human microenvironments, including the vasculature.
In the current study, we focused on detailed characterization of the vasculature using the previously reported human
embryonic stem cell teratoma (hESCT) tumor model previously shown to have human vessels (21, 22). This model has the
ease of standard xenograft models; however, tumor vessels are
derived from the human ESCs and are therefore of human
origin. It had not been clear whether these are "normal" human
vessels or true "tumor vessels" that express TVMs. Here, we
show that when injected with cancer cells, hESCTs have vessels
expressing human TVMs. With the addition of mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts and primary tumor vascular cells, about 80% of
the vessels in the tumor are human in origin and persist for up
to 12 weeks. Using hESCT ovarian cancer and breast cancer
models, we found that several TVMs are induced in a tumorspeciﬁc fashion. We then used this model to show the ability to
test the therapeutic activity of anti-human tumor vascular–
speciﬁc antibody therapeutics; an anti-THY1 immunotoxin
delayed tumor growth and resulted in central tumor necrosis.
Finally, we showed that this tumor model, with a human
microenvironment, enhances the engraftment and growth of
primary ovarian CSCs.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Use of hESCs was approved by the University of Michigan
Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee (Ann
Arbor, MI). H9 hESC (WiCell Research Institute, Madison, WI)
and H7-GFP hESC (a gift from Joseph Wu, Stanford University,
Stanford, CA) were grown as previously described (23). Undifferentiated ESC colonies were initially passaged by manual
dissection with ﬁnal passages conducted with enzymatic
digestion using TrypLE Select (Invitrogen). Human ovarian
cancer cell line HEY1 and SKOV3 (American Type Culture
Collection) were grown in RPMI containing 10% FBS. The
breast cancer cell line MCF7 (a gift from Dr. Max Wicha,
University of Michigan) was grown in Minimum Essential
Media (MEM) containing 10% FBS and 0.01 mg/mL bovine
insulin (Invitrogen). To create DsRED-expressing cells, both
MCF7 and HEY1 cells were transduced with DsRED-expressing
lentiviral construct (provided by the UMCC Vector core).
In vivo tumor models
NOD/SCID mice (Charles River) were housed and maintained in the University of Michigan Unit for Laboratory
Animal Medicine. All studies were approved by the University
Committee on the Use and Care of Animals. hESCTs were
generated as previously described (21–23). Brieﬂy, H9 hESCs
were cultured on mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF), man-

ually dispersed, and passaged. Approximately 5  105 undifferentiated H9 hESCs or H7-GFP ESCs were injected subcutaneously into the axilla of NOD/SCID mice (with or without
MEFs) with 100 mL of PBS and 200 mL of Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Once hESCTs were palpable, tumor cells in 40 mL of
PBS were injected intra-hESCT. A total of 2  105 tumor cells
(HEY1-DsREd or MCF7 DsRED) were injected alone or with
5,000 VE-Cadherinþ primary human tumor vascular cells
(isolated as previously described; ref. 7). For hESCTs injected
with primary ovarian CSCs, 700 (n ¼ 2), 5,000 (n ¼ 3), or 10,000
(n ¼ 3) primary ALDHþ ovarian cancer cells (from 6 different
patients) or 10,000 ALDH cells from paired samples were
injected (n ¼ 3). All tumors were harvested when hESCT tumor
volumes were about 2,000 mm3 (range, 4–12 weeks; median, 8
weeks). For ﬂank xenografts, 5  105 cells were injected in
100 mL of PBS and 200 mL of Matrigel into the axilla of NOD/
SCID mice. Tumors were imaged using bioﬂuorescence (Xenogen IVIS 2000, Caliper Life Sciences). Murine tumors were
APC/PTEN/p53-mutant mouse ovarian tumors (a gift from
Dr. Kathy Cho, University of Michigan; refs. 24, 25).
Isolation of cancer stem cells from primary ovarian
cancer specimens
Informed written consent was obtained from all patients
before tissue procurement. All studies were conducted with the
approval of the Institutional Review Board of the University of
Michigan. All tumors were from patients with stage III or IV
epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer. Tumors were
mechanically dissected into single-cell suspensions, red cells
lysed with ACK buffer, and cell pellets were collected by
centrifugation. CSCs were then isolated from primary ovarian
tumor single-cell suspensions using the ALDEFLUOR assay
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) as previously
described (26). Gating was established using propidium iodide
(PI) exclusion for viability. ALDH/DEAB-treated cells were
used to deﬁne negative gates. FACS was conducted using the
BD FACSCanto II or FACSAria (Becton Dickinson) under low
pressure in the absence of UV light.
Immunoﬂuorescence and immunohistochemistry
About 8-mm-thick sections from fresh-frozen tumors were
ﬁxed in acetone for 10 minutes and then washed with PBS and
blocked for 20 minutes. Primary antibody was incubated for 2
hours, washed with PBS, and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 hour. For immunoﬂuorescence (IF), slides were
washed with PBS and then mounted with Vectashield Mounting Medium for ﬂuorescence with DAPI H-1200 (Vector Laboratories). Antibodies used for IF and immunohistochemistry
(IHC) are listed in Supplementary Table S1. IHC staining was
conducted using the Vectastain ABC Kit (Vector) per manufacturer's instructions. Select p53 IHC was conducted by the
Histology/IHC Service at the University of Michigan.
RNA isolation and real-time PCR
Tumors were sectioned and regions of tumor with human
vasculature were conﬁrmed via IHC. Serial sections of were
dissolved in TRIzol (Invitrogen) and RNA was extracted
(PureLink RNA Mini Kit, Invitrogen) per manufacturer

recommendations. RNA integrity was conﬁrmed on the
Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. PCR was carried out for 40 cycles
with primers at 100 nmol/L concentrations (Supplementary
Table S2). All transcripts were conﬁrmed using 3% agarose
gel electrophoresis.
Quantiﬁcation of vessels
Vascular density quantiﬁcation was conducted as previously
described (27). Five sections from each of 3 tumors in each
tumor group were evaluated. Total mCD31 and hCD31 stain, as
deﬁned by pixel density and hue, was assessed using Olympus
Microsuite Biological Suite Software. The area of staining was
then compared between mCD31 and hCD31 using the 2-sided
Student t test. hCD31þ tumor microvascular density following
anti-THY1-toxin therapy was similarly assessed. hCD31-Alexa
594 and GFP expression were used to assess human vessels
either from tumor endothelial cell origin [Alexa-594þ (red)
only, or from hESCT origin (redþGFP). Sections were photographed in toto and then quantitated using Olympus software
as above.
Immunotoxin development and delivery
Anti-THY1-saporin immunotoxin was developed as previously described (27). About 2 mg of freshly conjugated
anti-THY1 antibody and saporin toxin, or an equimolar concentration of strepavidin-saporin or unlabeled anti-THY1 antibody was incubated with 5  104 mesenchymal stem cells
(MSC) in triplicate. After 3 days of treatment, viability cell was
assessed using Trypan Blue. To test the efﬁcacy of anti-TVM
therapeutics in vivo, hESCT-HEY1 tumors were treated with no
treatment (n ¼ 3) or 2 mg of rat IgG-saporin (n ¼ 3), or antiTHY1-saporin (n ¼ 4). Immunotoxin was delivered intravenously every other day for 3 doses. Tumor growth was tracked
using bioﬂuorescent imaging with the Xenogen IVIS 200
Imaging System and LivingImage software provided by the
Center of Molecular Imaging of the University of Michigan.
Mice were monitored the day before and after treatment. This
experiment was repeated with rat IgG-saporin controls (n ¼ 3)
and anti-Thy1-saporin (n ¼ 3).

Results
Vessels in hESCT-cancer model express TVMs in a cancer
cell–dependent manner
We generated hESCT-ovarian cancers (HEY1) and hESCTbreast cancers (MCF7) as previously described (23) using
DsRED-labeled cancer cells. IF showed clear, non-DsRED,
human CD31þ vessels consistent with prior reports of human
ESC–derived vessels (21, 22, 28, 29). Human vessels were
predominantly found in a peritumoral location (Fig. 1A) and
less frequently within the tumor islets and teratoma tissue. RTPCR was carried out to determine whether the ovarian- or
breast-speciﬁc TVMs were expressed in (i) HEY1 ovarian
cancer cell culture, (ii) HEY1 ovarian tumor xenografts, (iii)
in vivo hESCTs, or (iv) in vivo hESCT-HEY1 ovarian tumors. In
parallel, we assessed the expression of ovarian- or breast
cancer–speciﬁc TVMs were expressed in (i) MCF7 ovarian
cancer cell culture, (ii) MCF7 breast cancer xenografts, (iii) in
vivo hESCTs, or (iv) in vivo hESCT-MCF7 breast tumors. We

evaluated the expression of TVMs that have been reported to
be upregulated in numerous tumors including tumor endothelial marker-7 (TEM7), Integrin b3, and THY1, as well as for
TVMs reported to be ovarian cancer–speciﬁc including EGFL6,
P2Y-like receptor (GPR105), and F2RL1, or breast cancer–
speciﬁc such as FAP, HOXB2, SFRP2, and SLITRTK6. Unfortunately all TVM mRNAs (and every gene we have tested to
date) were expressed in both hESCTs and the ovarian cancer
and breast cancer hESCT cancer model, thus real-time PCR
(RT-PCR) suggested that TVMs were expressed in the hESCTs
but was otherwise uninformative (Fig. 1B).
We next conducted IHC to localize TVM expression within
the cell line xenografts, hESCT, hESCT-HEY1 ovarian tumors,
and hESCT-MCF7 breast cancers. Within hESCT controls,
TVM protein expression could be identiﬁed in various developmental tissues, but expression was generally not found in
vascular structures (Fig. 2). In contrast, the expression of
ovarian TVMs could be detected within peritumoral vessels
within the hESCT-HEY1 ovarian tumors (Fig. 2). Some vessels
were clearly ﬁlled with red blood cells, indicating a connection
with the murine vasculature and perfusion (Fig. 2 and data not
shown). Serial sections stained with anti-hCD31 antibody
conﬁrmed these structures as human vessels (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Identical results were obtained in an hESCT-SKOV3
ovarian cancer model (data not shown). Similarly, the breast
cancer–speciﬁc TVMs FAP, SFRP2, SLITRK6, and SMPD3 were
all expressed in the hESCT-MCF7 tumors (Fig. 2). No vascular
expression of any of the TVMs was detected in ﬂank tumor
xenografts (Fig. 2) or in a murine ovarian tumor model
(Supplementary Fig. S2), showing that IHC is not detecting
murine tumor vessels.
It remained unclear whether the distinctions in the tumor
vascular expression proﬁle observed for different tumors is
related to different methodologies of TVM identiﬁcation or a
true distinction in the pattern of expression related to the
tumor-speciﬁc microenvironment. We therefore also
assessed the vascular expression of "breast" TVMs in the
hESCT-HEY1 ovarian cancer model and the expression of
"ovarian" TVMs within the hESCT-MCF7 breast cancer
model. Interestingly, vascular expression of the "ovarian"
TVMs F2RL1, GPR105, and EGFL6 was not detected in
the hESCT-MCF7 breast cancer model (Fig. 2). Similarly the
"breast" TVMs FAP and SFRP2 were not expressed in the
vasculature of the hESCT-HEY1 ovarian tumors (Fig. 2). Rare
vascular expression of the "breast" TVMs SLITRK6 and
SMPD3 was detected in the hESCT-HEY1 ovarian tumor
model (Fig. 2). These ﬁndings suggest that some TVMs are
expressed in a cancer-speciﬁc manner and therefore likely
induced by tumor cells, whereas others are more promiscuous and may identify angiogenic vessels or vasculogenesis.
Enhancing human vascular density in the hESCT cancer
model
A primary goal of this study was to determine whether this
model could be used to test anti-human TVM immunotherapeutics. However, initial studies showed that only a minority of resultant vessels (15%) were of human origin with the
remainder being murine vessels (see below). To increase the

human CD31 and murine CD31 revealed that while the
hESCT-HEY1 ovarian cancer tumor model alone had about
15% human vessels, the addition of MEFs increased the
percentage of human vessels to about 40% (P ¼ 0.01; Fig.
3C). With the addition of VE-Cadherinþ tumor endothelial
cells, nearly 80% of the tumor vessels were human (P <
0.0001; Fig. 3C). HEY1 cells co-injected with 5000 VECadherinþ cells in Matrigel in the animals ﬂank showed no
human vessels (data not shown), showing that the profound
human vascularity is unique to the hESCT model. To determine whether the increase in human vessels in the presence
of VE-Cadherinþ cells was due to increased angiogenesis
from the hESCT cells or proliferation of the VE-Cadherinþ
cells, we repeated the above experiment using GFP-labeled
H7 ESCs (Fig. 3D). Evaluation of tumor vessels showed that
60% to 80% of the human vessels were GFP and thus
derived from the ovarian cancer VE-Cadherinþ cells, whereas the remaining 20% to 40% of human vessels were GFPþ
and therefore derived from hESCT cells (Fig. 3E). These data
show that the addition of human tumor vascular cells to this
model leads to a dramatic increase in human tumor vasculature such that the majority of vessels present in the tumor
are human in origin.

Testing an anti-TVM therapeutic in the hESCT ovarian
cancer model
To test the use of this model for screening anti-human
TVM immunotherapeutics, we developed an immunotoxin
targeting the human TVM THY1. This antigen was chosen
due to the availability of commercial antibodies that can
recognize the THY1 antigen in vivo. To create the immunotoxin, streptavidin-conjugated saporin toxin was coupled to
a biotinylated anti-human THY1 antibody. The cytotoxicity
of this immunotoxin was conﬁrmed in vitro against THY1þ
primary human MSCs; anti-THY1-immunotoxin resulted
in statistically signiﬁcant MSC death relative to antibody
alone or saporin toxin alone controls (Fig. 4A). To test the
efﬁcacy of anti-TVM-immunotoxin in vivo, anti-THY1saporin (n ¼ 7 total in 2 experiments) immunotoxin or
control rat IgG-saporin (n ¼ 6 total in 2 experiments) was
delivered intravenously to mice bearing hESCT-HEY1 DsRed
tumors. Tumor growth was tracked with bioﬂuorescent
imaging. While rat IgG-saporin–treated tumors showed
continued growth, THY1-saporin–treated hESCT-HEY1
ovarian tumors showed delayed growth and signiﬁcant
reduction in central tumor viability (the region dependent
on human vessels; Fig. 4B and C). Following completion of

The hESCT model promotes the in vivo growth of primary
human cancer stem cells
Human ovarian CSCs have been particularly challenging
to grow in vivo. Engraftment rates of CSCs directly isolated
from human ovarian tumors are only 20% to 40% in traditional ﬂank tumor models and 5,000 CSCs typically require 6
to 12 months to create a tumor (26). We hypothesized that
the human microenvironment of the hESCT model with a

human tumor vascular niche could greatly enhance the
growth of ovarian CSCs. Using ALDH as an ovarian CSC
marker (26), we assessed the efﬁciency of primary human
ovarian CSC engraftment in the hESCT tumor model. We
injected FACS-isolated ALDHþ primary human ovarian
CSCs (700–10,000) from 6 ovarian cancer patient samples
into either hESCTs or subcutaneously. hESCTs were allowed
to grow until they reached about 2,000 mm3 (4–12 weeks
after tumor cell injection). Histochemical analysis of
resected hESCT-ALDHþ CSCs showed regions consistent
with papillary serous tumor growth (Fig. 5A and data not
shown). To conﬁrm these areas represent ovarian tumor
cells, we exploited the recent ﬁnding that p53 is mutant in
more than 95% of serous ovarian tumors (31). p53 IHC
clearly identiﬁed human p53þ serous ovarian tumors in all
hESCTs injected with ALDHþ ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 5A
and C). Strong p53 stain was not identiﬁed in hESCTs alone
or from hESCTs injected with ALDHþ cells from a benign
ﬁbroadenoma (data not shown). ALDHþ ovarian cancer cells
injected subcutaneously in the ﬂank showed no growth
during this time period. Finally, we repeated this experiment, directly comparing the growth within hESCTs of
ALDHþ and ALDH cells within from 3 patients. hESCTs
injected with ALDHþ CSCs showed much more rapid growth
than hESCTs injected with paired ALDH cells, indicating
likely CSC engraftment in hESCTs (Fig. 5B). Once again, p53
IHC of resected hESCT-ALDHþ CSC tumors showed stain
in regions consistent with papillary serous tumor growth
(Fig. 5C). No p53 stain was noted in any of the hESCTALDH cell tumors, thus the "tumors" that grow in the
ALDH hESCT represent benign teratoma growth. These
data show primary ovarian CSC engraft in the human hESCT
microenvironment more efﬁciently than in murine subcutaneous tissue.

Discussion
These data show that the hESCT cancer model expresses
bona ﬁde human tumor vessels. These vessels express not
only the expected human vascular markers such as CD31 but
also the tumor-type–speciﬁc TVMs such as EGFL6 and
TEM7. A central rationale for the development of such
model system is for the testing of novel vascular-targeted
therapeutics. A major challenge for developing antibodybased therapies targeting tumor vessels has been the lack of
an animal model with a human tumor microenvironment
and human vessels; antibodies targeting human antigens
cannot be tested in traditional animal tumor models unless
the antibodies happen to cross-react between species. The
model advanced here addresses this issue and thus allows
screening of potential immunotherapeutics targeting human
vascular antigens. Similarly, this model can also be used to
test the in vivo binding activity of vascular-targeted peptides
(23, 30, 32).
The generation of large numbers of human tumor vessels in
this model required the addition of VE-Cadherinþ human
tumor vascular cells. Interestingly, the addition of only 5,000
vascular cells led to nearly 80% human tumor vessels, about
70% of which were not derived from hESCs, suggesting that the

3562

human VE-Cadherinþ cells are proliferating within the
hESCTs. Importantly, the human vessels in this model persisted throughout the period of tumor growth (4–12 weeks
after cancer cell injection).
The need to add freshly isolated human tumor vascular
cells could limit the widespread use of this model. However,
a signiﬁcant number of human vessels (40%) could still be
generated in the absence of human tumor vascular cells with
the addition of irradiated mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts. It is
possible that the addition of other pro-angiogenic cells such
MSCs (33) or tumor-associated myeloid cells (34) could
further increase the percentage of human vessels. One
limitation for therapeutic testing with this model, as with
other murine tumor models of human vasculature, is that
tumors are still ultimately dependent on the murine vasculature for blood ﬂow. Therefore, even with the complete
therapeutic elimination of the human tumor vessels, tumors
regions supplied by the murine tumor vasculature will
continue to grow.
While we used our model to conﬁrm anti-vascular therapeutics, it can also potentially be used to test vascular
imaging agents speciﬁcally targeting human vessels. This
model allows testing the sensitivity of these compounds to
detect tumor vasculature of "early-stage" tumors. We believe
that this murine model offers a means to investigate the basic
biology of human TVMs in vivo. Speciﬁcally, the mechanism
of tumor-speciﬁc TVM induction could be addressed, due to
the power to independently modulate the expression patterns of the hESC and the cancer cells themselves. This may be
particularly relevant given that we observed differential
induction of some tumor-speciﬁc TVMs by breast versus
ovarian cancer cell lines.
Finally, the above data show that this model permits direct
engraftment of primary human CSCs in a manner more
efﬁcient than subcutaneous injections. This expands upon
and is consistent with previous reports showing improved
growth of primary ovarian cell lines within hESCTs as compared with tumor ﬂanks (21, 22). Our previous studies using
ﬂank models for the engraftment of ALDHþ ovarian CSCs
showed engraftment rates of about 20% and tumor growth
required 6 to 12 months (26). Using the hESCT model, we
found 100% engraftment from as few as 700 ALDHþ primary
human CSC within 4 to 12 weeks of tumor cell injection within
the hESCTs. This model therefore represents a new tool to
enhance the efﬁciency of the study of primary human CSCs.
This model could potentially be further improved with the
addition of cancer-associated MSCs (35). These ﬁndings
emphasize the importance of the interplay between the
tumor and the surrounding microenvironment and will allow
a dissection of the signals within the tumor microenvironment that support cancer stem cell survival, proliferation,
and differentiation.

Conclusions
We have conﬁrmed the expression of human TVMs in a
murine tumor model with robust human tumor vasculature.
Importantly, many of these TVMs appear to be tumor-type–
speciﬁc, indicating a tumor niche–dependent induction of

targeting human tumor vessels. In addition, this model with
its unique human tumor microenvironment allowed 100%
engraftment of primary human CSCs. The hESCT system will
allow deeper probing of the role of the microenvironmentdependent induction of TVMs, their role in tumor biology
and interactions in the tumor vascular/cancer stem cell
niche.
