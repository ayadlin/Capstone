ABSTRACT
Melanoma is the most deadly form of cutaneous malignancy, and its incidence
rates are rising worldwide. In melanoma, constitutive activation of the BRAF/MEK/
ERK (MAPK) and PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PI3K) signaling pathways plays a pivotal role
in cell proliferation, survival and tumorigenesis. A combination of compounds that
lead to an optimal blockade of these critical signaling pathways may provide an
effective strategy for prevention and treatment of melanoma. The phytochemical
fisetin is known to possess anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities. We found
that fisetin treatment inhibited PI3K signaling pathway in melanoma cells. Therefore,
we investigated the effect of fisetin and sorafenib (an RAF inhibitor) alone and in
combination on cell proliferation, apoptosis and tumor growth. Combination treatment
(fisetin + sorafenib) more effectively reduced the growth of BRAF-mutated human
melanoma cells at lower doses when compared to individual agents. In addition,
combination treatment resulted in enhanced (i) apoptosis, (ii) cleavage of caspase-3
and PARP, (iii) expression of Bax and Bak, (iv) inhibition of Bcl2 and Mcl-1, and
(v) inhibition of expression of PI3K, phosphorylation of MEK1/2, ERK1/2, AKT and
mTOR. In athymic nude mice subcutaneously implanted with melanoma cells (A375
and SK-MEL-28), we found that combination therapy resulted in greater reduction
of tumor growth when compared to individual agents. Furthermore, combination
therapy was more effective than monotherapy in: (i) inhibition of proliferation and
angiogenesis, (ii) induction of apoptosis, and (iii) inhibition of the MAPK and PI3K
pathways in xenograft tumors. These data suggest that simultaneous inhibition of
both these signaling pathways using combination of fisetin and sorafenib may serve
as a therapeutic option for the management of melanoma.

INTRODUCTION

enhanced cell survival and tumorigenesis are associated
with mutational activation of a serine/threonine kinase
BRAF in approximately 60% of melanomas [5, 6].
Substitution of valine with glutamic acid at position 600
(V600E) in BRAF results in tremendous increase in BRAF
kinase activity leading to constitutive activation of the
BRAF/MEK/ERK (MAPK) signaling pathway [5, 6].
Sorafenib is an orally active small molecule and
multi-kinase modulator that inhibits the serine/threonine
kinases CRAF, BRAF (wild type) as well as mutant

Incidence of melanoma, the most aggressive
and lethal skin cancer, is rising rapidly worldwide [1].
An estimated 73,870 new cases and 9,940 deaths have
been projected to occur in the United States in 2015.
Approximately 75% of skin cancer-related deaths are
caused by melanoma [2]. Moreover, very low survival
rates of only 6 to 9 months have been reported in patients
after visceral metastasis [3, 4]. Increased cell proliferation,

BRAFV600E [7, 8]. In addition, several studies have
demonstrated that sorafenib inhibits activation of VEGR,
PDGFR, FGFR, c-KIT, MET, MAPK and angiogenesis [8,
9]. Sorafenib also induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo
in tumor cells harboring BRAF and/or KRAS or NRAS
mutations [8, 9]. Unfortunately, sorafenib demonstrated
poor efficacy in melanoma patients when employed as a
single agent [9, 10].
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR (PI3K) signaling pathway,
in addition to MAPK, also plays a vital role in the growth,
proliferation and survival of melanoma cells [11, 12].
The deletion or mutational inactivation of PTEN, which
negatively regulates PI3K, has been reported in 1030% of late-stage melanomas [13, 14]. Furthermore, the
PI3K downstream effector protein AKT has exhibited
overexpression in 50-75% of melanomas [15]. Recent
studies have shown that the MAPK pathway also
cooperates with PTEN-PI3K signaling to enhance cell
proliferation, survival and tumor progression [13, 14].
This evidence suggests that it may be beneficial to target
multiple signaling pathways in the treatment of melanoma.
Therefore, the combination of RAF inhibitor sorafenib
with pharmacologically active agents that target parallel
signaling pathways may be a promising strategy to inhibit
cell proliferation, survival and tumor progression.
Phytochemicals offer promising potential for
the development of more effective strategies for the
prevention/treatment of melanoma. Thus, identification
of phytochemicals that can be used in combination with
lower doses of chemotherapeutic drugs is of high clinical
relevance. One such agent, fisetin, a naturally occurring
flavonoid, is found in several fruits and vegetables, such
as strawberries, apples, persimmons, grapes, onions and
cucumbers. The anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and
neuro-protective activities of fisetin have been reported in
various studies [16-18]. It has exhibited anti-proliferative,
pro-apoptotic and anti-tumorigenic activities against
various cancers by inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/AKT/
mTOR, and NFκB signaling pathways [19-23]. In our
previous studies, we demonstrated that fisetin reduces
melanoma cell invasion and epithelial to mesenchymal
transition [22]. Murine investigations have also shown that
fisetin was rapidly absorbed and detectable in serum [2427]. To improve the efficacy of sorafenib in the treatment
of melanoma, we studied combination therapy (fisetin
and sorafenib) to evaluate whether fisetin potentiates
sorafenib-mediated cell death and tumor growth inhibition.
We found that combination treatment effectively inhibited
BRAF-mutated melanoma cell growth, induced apoptosis,
down-regulated MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways in
vitro and in vivo. In addition, combination therapy greatly
reduced angiogenesis markers in tumors of BRAF-mutated
melanoma xenografts.

Fisetin potentiated sorafenib-mediated inhibition
of cell growth, reduction of colony formation
and induction of apoptosis in BRAF-mutated
melanoma cells
Maintenance of uncontrolled proliferation and
survival of malignant cells is the critical step for tumor
initiation and progression [28]. Therefore, the effects of
fisetin on short- and long-term growth of BRAF-mutated
A375, SK-MEL-28 and RPMI-7951 melanoma cells were
determined by an MTT and colony formation assays.
Results of the MTT assay demonstrated that fisetin (1060µM) treatment significantly decreased the growth
of A375 (8.64-61.75%; p < 0.01), SK-MEL-28 (6.9459.79%; p < 0.01) and RPMI-7951 (11.60-64.11%; p <
0.01) cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure
1A). At low concentrations, fisetin effectively inhibited
long-term cell proliferation as shown by dose-dependent
decrease in colony number and size (Figs. 1B and 1C).
At high concentrations, fisetin induced apoptosis in
BRAF-mutated melanoma cells as evidenced by cleavage
of caspase-3 and PARP, and modulation in Bcl2 family
proteins (Figure 1D). Fisetin also inhibited protein
expression of the PI3Kp110α and PI3Kp85 subunits and
reduced phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 (Figure 1E).
We also observed that fisetin inhibited phosphorylation of
mTOR at Ser2448 and Ser2481 residues (Figure 1E). These
results illustrate fisetin’s abilities to inhibit melanoma cell
growth and induce apoptosis by modulating the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR (PI3K) signaling pathway.
To enhance therapeutic potential by simultaneously
targeting two different pathways, fisetin was combined
with the RAF inhibitor sorafenib. Twenty µM fisetin was
combined with 5 and 10µM sorafenib to evaluate the
effects of combination-therapy on short-term proliferation.
MTT assay results demonstrated a significant reduction
in cell growth inhibition (45-56% for A375; 36-48%
for SK-MEL-28; and 55-63% for RPMI-7951 cells) in
combination treatment groups to that when compared with
their respective control. (Figure 2A). To further explore
the observed inhibitory effects exhibited by combinations
of fisetin and sorafenib, combination index (CI) values
were determined. Values of CI (0.57, 0.814 and 0.507
for A375, SK-MEL-28 and RPMI-7951 respectively for
combination of 20µM fisetin and 5µM sorafenib; and
0.44, 0.774 and 0.513 for A375, SK-MEL-28 and RPMI7951 respectively for combination of 20µM fisetin and
10µM sorafenib) clearly demonstrated that combination
treatment exerted synergistic growth inhibition of BRAFmutated melanoma cells (Table 1). Since therapeutic
efficacy of agents depends on long-term effects on cancer
cells, we evaluated fisetin in combination with sorafenib

on the colony formation abilities of melanoma cells.
Results of the clonogenic assay clearly demonstrated that
combination treatment effectively inhibited the colony
number and size of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells (A375,
SK-MEL-28 and RPMI-7951) (Figures 2B and 2C).
Furthermore, combination treatment (fisetin and
sorafenib) was more effective at inducing apoptosis in
A375 and SK-MEL-28 cells as compared to individual
agents (Figure 2D). Treatment of A375 cells with 10 and
20µM of fisetin for 48 hrs resulted in 2.5% and 3.5%
early apoptotic cell population and 4.8% and 7.4% late
apoptotic cell population respectively. Similarly, treatment
of A375 cells with 5 and 10µM of sorafenib for 48 hrs
resulted in 6.2% and 14.1% early apoptotic cell population
and 10.2% and 15.5% late apoptotic cell population
respectively. Interestingly, the combination of 20µM
fisetin with 5 or 10µM of sorafenib greatly enhanced the
apoptotic cell population of A375 cells (25.5% and 16.3%

early apoptotic population; 21.5% and 41% late apoptotic
population) (Figure 2D). The observed increase in late
apoptotic cell population following combination treatment
demonstrated that combination treatment induced
apoptosis more rapidly than monotherapy. In addition,
fisetin (20µM) potentiated the apoptosis-inducing
potential of sorafenib (5 or 10µM) in SK-MEL-28 cells
since a higher apoptotic cell population (9.1% and 10.5%
early apoptosis; 23.8% and 45.9% late apoptosis) was
observed in these combination treatments than 10 and
20µM fisetin (2.1% and 2.8% early apoptosis; 5.3% and
7.1% late apoptosis) and 5 and 10µM sorafenib (1.7% and
5.4% early apoptosis; 7.5% and 14.6% late apoptosis)
monotherapy-treated cells (Figure 2D). These results
clearly demonstrated that fisetin potentiates sorafenibmediated inhibition of cell proliferation and augments cell
death by facilitating apoptosis.

modest effects on activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of
PARP. However, when these two agents were combined
the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP was greatly enhanced
in both the cell lines. While monotherapy also exhibited
modest effects on expression of anti-apoptotic proteins
Bcl2 and Mcl-1, combination treatment more effectively
reduced expression of these survival proteins. In addition,
the combination was more effective at inducing expression
of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak as compared to
individual agents (Figure 3A).

We next determined the effects of fisetin, sorafenib
and their combination on an in vivo xenograft mouse
model subcutaneously implanted with BRAF-mutated
A375 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells. The athymic nude
mice implanted with melanoma cells were treated with
fisetin (45 mg/kg body wt.), sorafenib (45 mg/kg body
wt.) and a combination orally three times per week. The
combination of fisetin and sorafenib showed significant
higher tumor growth inhibition than the individual agents.
Average tumor volume in mice injected with A375 cells
and treated with vehicle was 1124.12 mm3; whereas in
fisetin, sorafenib and combination treated groups, average
tumor volume was 716.12, 602.50 and 224.03 mm3
respectively. This significant decrease indicated 36.29%
(p < 0.01), 46.40% (p < 0.01) and 80.07% (p < 0.001)
reduction in tumor growth respectively (Figure 4A). The
growth inhibitory effects observed in combination group
were significantly higher (p < 0.001 versus fisetin and
p < 0.01 versus sorafenib) compared to monotherapy
groups. In SK-MEL-28 cell-inoculated mice, the average
tumor volume in the control group was 1265.69 mm3;
whereas the fisetin, sorafenib and combination groups,
averaged tumor volumes of 761.15, 552.02 and 15.93 mm3
respectively. This significant decrease indicated 39.86%
(p < 0.01), 56.38% (p < 0.01) and 98.74% (p < 0.001)
reduction in tumor growth respectively (Figure 4B). These
results demonstrate that combination treatment inhibited
tumor growth (p < 0.001 versus fisetin and p < 0.01
versus sorafenib) significantly higher than the fisetin and
sorafenib montherapy groups.
Based on the results of our in vitro and in vivo
growth inhibition studies, we hypothesized that a
synergistic reduction in cell growth and induction of
apoptosis with fisetin and sorafenib in BRAF-mutant
melanoma cells might also abrogate growth of established
tumors. Therefore treatment of mice was started when
the tumor size reached ~200 mm3 and terminated when
tumor size reached ~1200 mm3 in the control group.
Monotherapy treatment (fisetin or sorafenib alone) of mice
bearing A375 xenograft tumors resulted in substantial
tumor growth reduction (18.88% and 28.16%) with
1022.54 and 905.53 mm3 respective tumor volumes when
compared to control 1260.56 mm3. Combination treatment
was highly effective in reducing tumor growth (56.65%;
p < 0.01) as compared to the control group with tumor
size of 546.36 mm3 only (Figure 4C). Furthermore, this
effect was also significant (p < 0.05) when compared
with fisetin or sorafenib alone. Similarly, the treatment of
SK-MEL-28 tumor bearing mice with fisetin or sorafenib
alone produced a significant tumor growth inhibition
(32.56% and 40.55%; p < 0.05) with 844.59 and 744.41

Fisetin in combination with sorafenib effectively
down-regulated MAPK and PI3K signaling
pathways in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells
Constitutive activation of MAPK signaling in
melanoma is associated with increased cell proliferation,
survival and tumor progression [29, 30]. Studies have
demonstrated that activated BRAF in the MAPK
signal transduction pathway propagates signals by
phosphorylating MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 [31, 32]. Therefore,
we investigated the effects of fisetin and sorafenib alone
and in combination on MAPK signaling pathway. We
found that combination treatment more effectively
reduced phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in
BRAF-mutated melanoma cells than individual agents
(Figure 3B). In BRAF-mutated melanoma, the MAPK
pathway cooperates with PI3K signaling to promote
melanoma initiation and progression [30, 33]. Activation
of PI3K signaling that regulates cell proliferation, survival
and progression of tumor is a common genetic event in
melanomas. The elevated PI3K signaling correlates with
progression of tumors and has been observed in metastatic
melanomas [11, 12]. PI3K/AKT-mediated activation of the
downstream target mTOR results in cell proliferation and
survival by regulating the translation of proteins involved
in tumor progression [34, 35]. Therefore, the effect of
fisetin in combination with sorafenib on the PI3K signaling
pathway was evaluated in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells.
Western blot analysis demonstrated that combination
treatment significantly reduced the protein expression
of PI3K (catalytic subunit p110α and phosphorylation
of AKT at Ser473 (Figure 3B). Furthermore, loss of
functional PTEN, a negative regulator of PI3K signaling,
has been reported in more than half of all melanomas [33].
Since BRAF mutation and concurrent down-regulation
(reduced expression or loss of function) of PTEN is
common in melanomas [33, 36], we also quantified PTEN
expression in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells following
combination treatment. We observed that expression of
PTEN was greatly enhanced in combination treated cells
as compared to cells treated with individual agents (Figure
3B). In addition, combination therapy greatly reduced
the phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 as compared to
individual agents (Figure 3B).

This effect was also significant (p < 0.05) when compared

conditions.

Next, we examined the expression of molecules
associated with cell proliferation in tumors of nude

demonstrated a decreased intensity-staining pattern of cell

signaling also contributes to intrinsic cascades involved
in melanoma development and progression [30, 33, 40,
41]. Therefore, it may be necessary to simultaneously
target both pathways in the treatment of melanoma. In
the present investigation, the non-toxic flavonoid fisetin
has shown potential to inhibit melanoma cell growth and
induce apoptosis of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells by
reducing PI3K signaling. Therefore, fisetin was combined
with sorafenib to enhance therapeutic efficacy. Our results
demonstrated that the simultaneous targeting of these two
parallel cell survival signaling pathways with fisetin and
sorafenib resulted in enhanced cell growth inhibition,
increased apoptosis and greater reduction in tumor growth
and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the low-dose fisetin and
sorafenib combination worked synergistically to inhibit
melanoma cell growth and abrogate colony formation.
Evasion of apoptosis due to intrinsic or acquired
resistance is one of the hallmarks of cancers resulting
in tumor development and progression [42, 43]. The
induction of apoptosis in cancer cells has been the center
of traditional cancer chemotherapy and targeted therapy
for many years [44, 45]. A growing body of evidence
has demonstrated that sorafenib induces apoptosis in
melanoma cells by activating pro-apoptotic proteins (Bad,
Bak and Bax), down-regulating anti-apoptotic proteins
(Bcl2, Bcl-Xl and Mcl-1) and inducing PARP cleavage
[46, 47]. Our data demonstrated that fisetin also induces
apoptosis in melanoma cells by cleavage of caspase-3 and
PARP, and modulation of expression of the Bcl2 family of
proteins in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells. When fisetin
was combined with sorafenib, fisetin further augmented
the apoptosis-inducing potential of sorafenib in BRAFmutated melanoma cells. Several studies have clearly
demonstrated that the MAPK and PI3K pathways intersect
at multiple levels [30, 33, 40]. Constitutive activation of
AKT protects cells from BRAF inhibitors, and detection of
elevated AKT phosphorylation in BRAF-inhibitor-resistant
melanoma cells suggests that enhanced AKT levels are
associated with BRAF-inhibitor-ineffectiveness [40].
Activated AKT inhibits apoptosis by inactivation of proapoptotic proteins and cleavage of caspases. Furthermore,
stability of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 in melanoma
cells is regulated by ERK1/2, and enhanced expression
of this protein in melanoma cells has demonstrated
resistance against BRAF inhibitor-induced apoptosis
[46, 47]. Evidence suggests that ERK1/2 inhibition alone
remains insufficient due to reprieve of ERK1/2-dependent
negative feedback activation of RAS and PI3K signaling
[48]. Therefore, successful inhibition of MAPK will
require co-inhibition of PI3K and other alternative cell
survival pathways. In the present investigation, we found
that fisetin inhibited expression of PI3K and enhanced
expression of PTEN as well as decreased phosphorylation
of AKT and mTOR in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells.
When fisetin was combined with sorafenib, co-targeting
of these two parallel signaling pathways resulted in

sorafenib-mediated
downregulation of the MAPK and PI3K signaling
in xenograft tumors
Since results of in vitro and in vivo growth inhibition
demonstrated that the combination of fisetin and sorafenib
is highly effective in inducing apoptosis and reducing the
tumor growth as compared to single agents, we examined
the effects of these treatments on the MAPK and PI3K
signaling pathways. Combination treatment was more
effective in reducing the phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and
ERK1/2 than either fisetin or sorafenib alone (Figure 7A
and 7B). Immunoblot analysis of tumor lysates revealed
that the combination of fisetin and sorafenib further
reduced expression of PI3K, enhanced PTEN expression,
and decreased phosphorylation of AKT and mTOR as
compared to monotherapy (Figure 7A and 7B).

Fisetin potentiated anti-angiogenic effects of
sorafenib in xenograft tumors
Since tumors maintain their growth and survival
by developing new blood vessels, agents targeting
angiogenesis have shown promising anticancer potential.
The combination of fisetin and sorafenib significantly
inhibited melanoma cell growth, induced apoptosis
and down-regulated cell survival signaling pathways in
vitro and in vivo. An accumulating body of evidence has
shown that agents targeting MAPK or PI3K signaling
cascade also inhibit angiogenesis [37, 38]. Since
combination treatment more effectively reduced MAPK
and PI3K signaling pathways in xenograft tumors, we
next determined the effects of combination therapy on
angiogenesis in xenograft tumors. Figure 7C and 7D
illustrate our findings that combination treatment was
more effective in reducing the markers of angiogenesis
(CD31 and VEGF) in tumors than monotherapy.

DISCUSSION
In spite of exerting significant anti-cancer properties
in various preclinical models, sorafenib, a multi-kinase
inhibitor that targets MAPK signaling pathway, failed
to translate its potential in melanoma patients due to
limited efficacy against metastatic melanoma [9, 10].
Furthermore, patients treated with sorafenib exhibited
considerable serious side-effects [39]. Although acquired
resistance to BRAF inhibitors treatment is known to
involve reactivation of MAPK signaling, an accumulating
body of evidence suggests that activation of PI3K

enhanced apoptosis in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells.
In addition, fisetin alone reduced the phosphorylation
of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 in these cells. When combined
with sorafenib, fisetin further potentiated the reduction in
phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. Furthermore,
combination treatment also resulted in greater downregulation of PI3K expression, and phosphorylation of
AKT and mTOR as compared to fisetin or sorafenib alone.
Fisetin also potentiated restoration of PTEN, a negative
regulator of PI3K signaling that cooperates with MAPK
signaling in melanoma.
More importantly, the in vitro effects of fisetin were
translated under in vivo conditions. The addition of fisetin
potentiated the antitumor activity of sorafenib against
growing as well as pre-existing melanoma xenograft
tumors. The BRAF mutation in melanoma drives
enhanced proliferation through MAPK-induced expression
of cyclin D1 and mediates BRAF inhibitor resistance in
melanoma cells [49, 50]. In addition, PI3K signaling also
regulates cyclin D1 expression and cell proliferation [34].
Like sorafenib, oral administration of fisetin monotherapy
significantly inhibited the tumor growth of BRAF-mutated
melanoma cells in nude mice by inhibiting tumor cell
proliferation markers (PCNA, Ki67 and cyclin D1). Fisetin
significantly inhibited tumor growth through induction of
apoptosis by activating cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP
proteins, and modulating expression of Bcl2 family
proteins. In the present investigation, combination (fisetin
and sorafenib) treatment produced a greater reduction
in cell proliferation markers than either agent alone.
Moreover, fisetin significantly potentiated sorafenib’s
antitumor activity and apoptosis-inducing potential by
further reducing MAPK and PI3K signaling.
Mounting evidence suggests that the formation
of new blood vessels is a prominent feature among
melanomas [51, 52]. Increased VEGF protein expression
and accumulation in the tumor stroma has been associated
with the transition of radial to vertical growth phase in
melanoma [52, 53]. Several studies have demonstrated
that mutant BRAF regulates secretion of pro-angiogenic
factors, enhances growth and increases the development
of vasculature in melanoma tumors [38, 54]. Studies have
shown that sorafenib inhibits angiogenesis by inhibiting
VEGF production and MAPK signaling in endothelial
cells [9, 55]. In addition, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
also plays an important role in angiogenesis regulation
in various cancers by increasing VEGF production in
endothelial cells as well as in cancer cells [56, 57].
Therefore, fisetin likely augmented sorafenib’s antiangiogenic properties in melanoma tumors by inhibiting
PI3K pathway.
In summary, our findings demonstrate fisetin’s
ability to potentiate the anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic,
and anti-tumor effects of sorafenib. This phytochemical
may be a worthy, minimally-toxic adjuvant chemotherapy
to prevent drug resistance and improve the therapeutic

efficacy of anti-melanoma drugs in the future.
Translational studies are the next steps to gauge the
potential impact of these findings in humans.

Cell culture and treatment
Human malignant melanoma cells A375 (CLR1619) and RPMI-7951 (HTB-66) were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA,
USA). SK-MEL-28 cells were obtained from Alan
Houghton, Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research

Logan, Utah, USA) medium respectively supplemented
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (SigmaAldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 100 mg/
ml penicillin-streptomycin (Mediatech Inc., Manassas,
VA, USA). RPMI-7951 cells were cultured in EMEM
medium (Quality Biologicals Inc., Gaithersburg, MD)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine

cytometer (Ann Arbor, MI, USA) as described earlier [23].

Cell proliferation assay

Protein lysates preparation and western blotting

To determine the growth inhibitory effect of fisetin
on melanoma cells, approximately 1 x103 melanoma cells
per well were plated in 96-well plates (Becton Dickinson
and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) in complete
growth medium. The following day, cells were treated
with various concentrations of fisetin (10-60µM) for 48
hrs. After 48 hrs incubation cell viability was determined
by employing MTT assay as described earlier [23]. In
order to determine the effect of fisetin and sorafenib
combination on cell growth, melanoma cells were treated
with lower doses of fisetin (10 and 20µM), sorafenib
(5 and 10µM), and their combinations (fisetin 20µM +
sorafenib 5µM; and fisetin 20µM + sorafenib 10µM) for
48 hrs and the MTT assay was performed. Combination
index (CI) values for fisetin and sorafenib were calculated
by Compusyn software (http://www.combosyn.com/
feature.html) developed by Chou-Talalay [58].

Melanoma cells were treated with 10-40µM fisetin
alone for 48 hrs. Similarly, cells were treated with 20µM
fisetin, 5µM sorafenib and a combination of 20µM fisetin
and 5µM sorafenib for 48 hrs. After incubation, the
medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed with
PBS. Cells were lysed with ice-cold cell lysis buffer with
freshly added protease inhibitor cocktail. Protein lysates
from melanoma xenograft tumors were prepared with
freshly frozen tumors samples. Approximately 250 mg
tumor tissue was homogenized and lysed using 0.5ml of
lysis buffer. Supernatant was collected from cell lysates
after centrifugation at 14, 000 g for 10 min at 4°C [22].
Protein concentration of each sample was determined
using the DC Protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA, USA). Western blotting was performed on
25-50µg protein using 8-10% Tris-glycine gels. Resolved
protein was transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride
membrane (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA).
The 5% non-fat dry milk in 0.1% Tween-20 in TrisBuffered Saline (TBS), pH 7.6 was used for one hour to
block non-specific sites on blots. Blots were incubated
with the primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at
4°C followed by incubation with horse-radish peroxidase
conjugate secondary antibodies. Bands on the membrane
were developed by chemiluminescence using Pierce ECL
Western Blotting Substrate reagents (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL) and autoradiography using HyBlot CL
Autoradiography Film obtained from Densville Scientific
Inc., (Metuchen, NJ, USA) [22, 23].

Clonogenic assay
To determine the effect of fisetin on long term cell
proliferation, 60-70% confluent melanoma cells were
treated with indicated concentrations of fisetin for 24
hrs in complete growth medium. After incubation, cells
from fisetin treated and control plates were harvested in
separate tube. Approximately 500 cells per well from
each tube were plated separately in 6-well plate (Corning
Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) in complete growth
medium and allowed to grow for 2 weeks. Media was
replaced after one week. After 2 weeks incubation,
cells were washed once with chilled PBS (HyClone
Laboratories, Logan, Utah, USA) and fixed in chilled
methanol for 10 min. Cells were then stained with 0.5%
crystal violet (Fischer Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA)
solution prepared in 25% methanol for 5 min. To remove
excess of crystal violet, wells were washed three times
with water and air-dried. To determine the effect of
combination treatment on colony formation, melanoma
cells were treated with lower doses of fisetin/sorafenib/
fisetin + sorafenib, and the colony formation assay was
performed as described above.

Treatment of athymic nude mice
All in vivo tumor growth experiments were
performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines and
animal protocol (APN:140809459) used in this study
was approved by the IACUC. Five-week-old female
athymic nude mice were purchased from NCI-Frederick
National Laboratory for Cancer Research and housed in a
12 hrs light/12 hrs dark schedule at 24±2°C temperature,
50%±10% relative humidity under pathogen-free
conditions. Mice were fed with phytochemical free diet
AIN-76 SEMI PD (Test Diet, Richmond, IN, USA) ad
libitum. Mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 0.1ml
of 2.5x106 A375 cells or 5x106 SK-MEL-28 cells (prepared
in a 50μl media + 50μl matrigel) in each flank to initiate
tumor growth. Mice were then randomly divided into two
sets of four groups with 6 mice in each group. The first

Apoptosis assay
Approximately 5x105 cells were plated in 6-well
plate. Next day, cells were treated with 10 and 20µM of
fisetin, 5 and 10µM of sorafenib, and their combinations
(fisetin 20µM + sorafenib 5µM; and fisetin 20µM +
sorafenib 10 µM). After 48 hrs, apoptotic cell populations

set of four groups was treated on the day following cell
inoculation. In the first set, mice of group one were treated
with 200µl vehicle orally and served as control. The mice
of the second group received fisetin 45mg/kg orally
in 200µl of 5% cremaphor EL + 2% ethanol in water,
three times/week. The mice of the third group received
sorafenib 45mg/kg orally in 200µl of 5% cremaphor EL
+ 2% ethanol in water, three times/week. The mice of the
fourth group received a combination of fisetin 45mg/kg +
sorafenib 45mg/kg orally in 200µl of 5% cremaphor EL +
2% ethanol in water, three times/week. Tumor sizes were
measured twice a week, and tumor volume was calculated
by the formula ½ (L1 × L2 × H), where L1 is the long
diameter, L2 is the short diameter, and H is the height of
the tumor. In second set of experiment, mice were treated
similarly as described above when their tumor size reached
approximately 200 mm3. The experiment was terminated
by sacrificing all the mice by CO2 inhalation and death
was confirmed by cervical dislocation when tumor volume
reached approximately 1200 mm3 in the control group.
