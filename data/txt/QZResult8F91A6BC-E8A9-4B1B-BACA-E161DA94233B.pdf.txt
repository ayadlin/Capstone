ABSTRACT
Adjuvant chemotherapy is commonly given to surgically treated non-small-cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, the prerequisite for chemotherapy needs
to be scrutinized in order to maximize the benefits to patients. In this study, we
observed that NSCLC cells with high Id1 protein expression were vulnerable to the
treatment of paclitaxel and cisplatin. In addition, paclitaxel and cisplatin caused Id1
protein degradation through ubiquitination. In the nude mice xenograft model, the
tumor growth was reduced to a large degree in the Id1-overexpressing group upon
treatment with paclitaxel and cisplatin. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining
for Id1 followed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that surgically treated
NSCLC patients with high Id1 expression in primary tumor tissues had better diseasefree and overall survivals after adjuvant paclitaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy. In
summary, our current data suggest that Id1, a generally negative prognostic factor,
predicts a favorable prognosis in the case of surgically treated NSCLC patients
receiving the definitive adjuvant chemotherapy. The distinct role of Id1 reported
in this study may arise from the phenomenon of Id1 dependence of NSCLC cells
for survival, which renders the cancer cells additionally susceptive to the adjuvant
chemotherapy with paclitaxel and cisplatin.

treatment modalities for NSCLC [1]. Surgery alone for
NSCLC patients, however, shows a high recurrence rate
with the 5-year recurrence ranging from 25% in stage IA
to 75% in stage IIIA [2]. Notably, adjuvant chemotherapy,
especially the platinum-based adjuvant therapy,
advantageously reduces the recurrence and improves
patient survival in surgically resected NSCLC [2-4].
Id (inhibitor of differentiation and DNA binding)
proteins are helix-loop-helix proteins that form
heterodimers with bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix)
transcription factors to inhibit the binding of bHLH
transcription factors to DNA [5]. The gene knockout or
protein knockdown studies reveal that Id proteins are
essential for cell proliferation and maintenance of cell
viability [6-8]. For example, double knockout of Id1 and
Id3 showed embryonic lethality in mice [9]. In addition
to that, Id proteins act as important regulators for tumor
growth, vascularization, invasiveness and metastasis [10,
11].
Id proteins consist of four subtypes, namely Id1,
Id2, Id3, and Id4 [10, 12]. Among the four Id subtypes
expressed in primary human malignancies, Id1 has been
shown strongly correlated with various types of tumors,
including lung cancer [13, 14]. For instance, our group
previously reported that Id1 was abundantly expressed
in human NSCLC cell lines, while the expression level
of Id1 in normal lung cells was low [15]. Clinically, high
Id1 protein levels were present in the tumors of NSCLC
compared with normal lung tissues [16, 17]. Moreover,
high Id1 expression was associated with a poor survival
rate and the resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy,
or both, in NSCLC patients [18, 19].
In this study, we investigated the role of Id1
expression in NSCLC cells treated with paclitaxel and
cisplatin by in vitro and in vivo assays. Furthermore, we
carried out clinical-statistical analysis to examine the
association between Id1 expression and treatment outcome
in surgically resected NSCLC patients followed by
definitive adjuvant paclitaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy.
Our current data indicated that, while overexpression of
Id1 promoted NSCLC cell growth, co-treatment with
paclitaxel and cisplatin led to a greater reduction of the
growth of NSCLC cells overexpressing Id1 compared
with that of control cells. In addition, the NSCLC patients
with high Id1 expression in primary tumor tissues had
a better survival rate than the patients with low Id1
expression after surgical resection followed by the
definitive chemotherapy. These findings suggest that high
Id1 expression could enable the cancer cells to rely on Id1
for survival more than other surviving pathways as a result
of oncogene addiction [20-22], which may hence provide
a novel insight for evaluation of the prognostic role and
therapeutic potential of Id1 in NSCLC.

Effect of paclitaxel and cisplatin on Id1 protein
expression and cytotoxicity in NSCLC cells
To study the effect of paclitaxel on Id1 protein
expression in NSCLC cells, H520 cells were treated with
paclitaxel and a time-dependent decrease in Id1 expression
was observed (Figure 1A). In addition, paclitaxel
treatment of A549, H460, and H520 lung cancer cells
suppressed Id1 expression in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 1B). We then analyzed the inhibitory effect of cotreatment of paclitaxel and cisplatin on Id1 expression in
Id1-GFP-overexpressing H460 cells. The results showed
that Id1 expression was suppressed more in the Id1-GFPoverexpressing cells (clones O1, O4, and O12) than the
vector control (clone P7) by the co-treatment (Figure 1C,
middle panel). Intriguingly, while Id1-GFP overexpression
(clones O1, O4, and O12) promoted cell proliferation in
H460 cells, the cell viability was suppressed to a larger
extent by co-treatment of paclitaxel and cisplatin in the
Id1-GFP-overexpressing cells compared with the vector
control (Figure 1D). As Id1 was known to promote
Akt activation via phosphorylation in lung cancer
and other caner types [15, 27, 28], we also examined
whether treatment of paclitaxel and cisplatin affected
the expression level of phosphorylated Akt. Our data
revealed that the Akt phosphorylation (p-Akt Ser473) in
Id1-overexpressing H460 cells (clone O4) was suppressed
after treatment with paclitaxel or cisplatin, in particular
when the two drugs were applied in combination (Figure
1E), implying that the effect of paclitaxel and cisplatin
was mediated through Id1/Akt pathway.
It was reported that ubiquitination-proteasome
system, one of the major protein degradation mechanisms
[29], was related to the decrease of cellular Id1 [30].
Therefore, we sought to test whether the protein
ubiquitination-proteosome was involved in the paclitaxeland cisplatin-reduced Id1 expression. As shown in Figure
2A, the suppression of endogenous Id1 and overexpressed
Id1-GFP in the Id1-GFP-overexpressing H460 cells
(clone O4) upon treatment with paclitaxel and cisplatin
was reversed when co-treated with the proteasome
inhibitor MG132. In addition, the increased levels of
ubiquitinated Id1 (Id1-polyUb) were detected in Id1-GFPoverexpressing H460 cells (clone O4) in the presence of
MG132 by immunoprecipitation using anti-Id1 antibody
and immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Figure
2B). Together, the results suggest that paclitaxel- and
cisplatin-induced Id1 protein degradation was mediated
through the ubiquitination-proteosome system.

shown). Immunohistochemical analysis also revealed that
the expression of Id1 and p-Akt (Ser473) was decreased
upon co-treatment with paclitaxel and cisplatin, especially
in the Id1-GFP-overexpressing group (Figure 3B).

To further confirm the role of Id1 overexpression
in lung tumor growth when treated with paclitaxel and
cisplatin, the nude mice xenograft assay was employed.
As shown in Figure 3A, tumor growth in the untreated
Id1-GFP-overexpressing group (Id1-OE, O4) occurred
at a faster rate than that in the untreated vector control
group (Id1-EV, P7). However, there was a more dramatic
reduction of the tumor observed when co-treated with
paclitaxel and cisplatin in the Id1-GFP-overexpressing
group (Id1-OE+C/T, O4) (P < 0.0001) compared with
the vector control (Id1-EV+C/T, P7) (P = 0.04). The
body weights of all mice were not significantly different
when sacrificed after two weeks of the treatment (data not

4A. Scores 1, 2 and 3 were categorized as low expression
(36.1%), and score 4 was categorized as high expression
(63.9%). The Id1 staining was predominantly observed in
lung cancer tissues but not in the adjacent normal lung
tissues (Figure 4A). An increased level of Id1 expression
in lung cancer tissues was positively correlated with the
increased tumor size (4.54±0.24 cm of the tumor in the
high Id1 expression group vs. 3.70±0.24 cm of the tumor
in the low Id1 expression group; P = 0.022) (Table 1).
Notably, after receiving the adjuvant chemotherapy the
patients with high Id1 expression in tumor tissues showed
a better disease-free survival and overall survival than
those with low Id1 expression by Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis (Figure 4B). The mean of disease-free survival
in the groups of high Id1 and low Id1 expression were
34.45±2.67 and 20.73±2.74 months, respectively. In
addition, the mean of overall survival in the groups of
high Id1 and low Id1 expression were 44.27±2.00 and
31.58±2.95 months, respectively.
To further investigate the association of Id1
expression and clinical parameters with disease-free
survival, univariate and multivariable Cox regression
analysis were applied. In the univariate analysis,
statistically significant associations with disease-free
survival were observed for the two parameters: lymph
node status (P = 0.002 for N1 status and P = 0.001 for N2
status) and Id1 expression (P = 0.001) (Table 2). In the
multivariate analyses, lymph node status (P = 0.015 for N1
status and P = 0.004 for N2 status) and Id1 expression (P
= 0.024) also showed a statistical significance associating

with the disease-free survival (Table 2).
We then analyzed the association of Id1 expression
and clinical parameters with overall survival by univariate
and multivariable Cox regression analysis. In the
univariate analyses, statistically significant associations
with overall survival were obtained for the following
parameters: lymph node status (P = 0.006 for N1 status
and P = 0.009 for N2 status), histology (P = 0.031),
performance status (P = 0.005), and Id1 expression (P =
0.002) (Table 3). In the multivariate analysis, statistically
significant associations with overall survival included
lymph node status (P = 0.005 for N1 status and P = 0.009
for N2 status), histology (P = 0.003), performance status
(P = 0.002), and Id1 expression (P = 0.022) (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
In our clinical analysis, the size of primary tumor of
NSCLC patients with high Id1 expression was in average
larger than that of the patients with low Id1 expression
before the definitive adjuvant chemotherapy (Table 1),
implying that Id1 acted as a negative prognostic factor in
NSCLC. In spite of the primary tumor size, the NSCLC
patients with high Id1 expression showed a better survival
rate than the patients with low Id1 expression after the
adjuvant chemotherapy (Figure 4), suggesting that
Id1 predicts a favorable prognosis under the specified
treatment condition. It might seem paradoxical at first,
however, the different prognostic role of Id1 could be

reasoned by the occurrence of oncogene addiction.
Oncogene addiction is a phenomenon regarding
the dependence of cancer cells on a particular oncogene
for survival over other surviving pathways [20-22]. For
example, it was reported that imatinib, an inhibitor of
Bcr-Abl, selectively induced cytotoxicity in the Bcr-Abltransfected HL-60 leukemic cells compared with the BcrAbl-negative parental cells [31]. On the other hand, the
Bcr-Abl mutant (T315I)-transfected K562 leukemic cells
showed resistance to the killing by imatinib in comparison
to the Bcr-Abl-positive parental cells, suggesting that these
cancer cells relied on Bcr-Abl for survival to a large degree
(i.e. addiction to Bcr-Abl) [32, 33]. In another study, it
was found that there was a reciprocal regulation between
B-Myb and MYCN in neuroblastoma, and the tumor cells
were addicted to B-Myb in a MYCN-dependent manner
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for cell proliferation [34]. Furthermore, treatment of
c-Myc-expressing myeloma cells with 10058-F4, a specific
inhibitor of c-Myc/MAX heterodimerization, resulted in
an increase of cytotoxicity, suggesting that there was an
addiction to c-Myc for survival in these cancer cells [35,
36]. There are also different types of oncogene addiction
in relation to cellular activities. For example, the Rasmediated tumor growth was dependent on the elevated
levels of autophagy (i.e. autophagy addiction) [37]. More
recently, Hall et al. reported that melanoma cells were
addicted to glycolytic activity, which was up-regulated
by the presence of mutant B-Raf (V600E) in these
cancer cells [38]. Our current data of in vitro and in vivo
model assays indicated that, while overexpression of Id1
promoted the cancer growth of NSCLC cells, co-treatment
of paclitaxel and cisplatin caused a greater effect of

reduction on cancer cell growth in the Id1-overexpressing
NSCLC cells compared with the control cells (Figure 1D
and 3). Along with our clinical analysis (Figure 4), these
results suggest that NSCLC cells expressing high levels of
Id1 may show a preference to rely on Id1 for survival (i.e.
addiction to Id1), and therefore targeting Id1 in NSCLC
cells with high Id1 expression would be considered a
potentially effective therapeutic strategy.
It has been reported that adjuvant chemotherapies
are advantageous for disease-free and overall survival
among the patients with surgically resected NSCLC [2,
3, 39, 40]. Several biomarkers were reported as predictors
for NSCLC patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapies,
such as βIII tubulin, ERCC1, p27, p53, Ras, and Id1 [18,
41-43]. While these clinical studies showed the application
of biomarkers for prediction of treatment outcome, the
molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical responses
remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated
for the first time that the decreased level of Id1 was caused
by paclitaxel and cisplatin treatment (Figure 1C), and
the reduction of Id1 under this treatment was mediated
through a mechanism involving ubiquitination/proteasome
degradation system (Figure 2). Besides, treatment of Id1overexpressing NSCLC cells with paclitaxel and cisplatin
led to a reduced level of phosphorylated Akt at Ser473
(Figure 1E), which was known a downstream signaling
molecule of Id1 in NSCLC and other cancer cells [15, 44].
Since there are different signaling molecules (e.g. MAPK,
PKC, mTOR, ATM, etc.) involved in Akt activation via
Ser473 phosphorylation [45-48], it would be worthy to
further investigate which of these molecules plays a role
in the Id1/Akt pathway of the paclitaxel- and cisplatintreated NSCLC.
It was noticed that the prognostic role of Id1 in
our clinical analysis for survival in the NSCLC patients
underwent adjuvant chemotherapy (Figure 4) appeared to
be different from the findings of Ponz-Sarvisé et al. [18],
whose report showed that Id1 was a poor prognostic factor
in NSCLC patients. The reason for this discrepancy is
unclear. However, it may result from the dissimilar clinical
settings inherited in these analyses. For example, a single
treatment modality (i.e. adjuvant chemotherapy) was
employed in our current study, whereas there was more
than one treatment modality (i.e. adjuvant chemotherapy,
or radiotherapy combining adjuvant chemotherapy) given
to the patients in their report [18]. As there have been a
variety of adjuvant chemotherapies developed for NSCLC
[49, 50], it will be valuable to determine whether Id1 also
plays a role in NSCLC patients treated with different
regimens of adjuvant chemotherapies.
In conclusion, our data suggest that Id1, a generally
negative prognostic factor, served as a favorable prognostic
factor in the case of surgically resected NSCLC patients
receiving adjuvant paclitaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy.
The differential roles of Id1 may be reasoned as a result of
Id1 addiction in NSCLC cells for survival in the presence
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of paclitaxel and cisplatin treatment. Together, our current
study provides a novel view of Id1 in the prognosis and
therapeutic potential for NSCLC patients.

were obtained from all patients. Staging was classified
according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system
[23]. Eighty-three surgically treated NSCLC patients
with six cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy for four
weeks post-operative were included in this study. The
adjuvant chemotherapy regimen consisted of paclitaxel
administered at a dose of 80 mg/m2 body surface area on
days 1, 8, and 15, and cisplatin administered at a dose
of 60 mg/m2 body surface area on day 15. The resected
specimens were processed for tissue microarray and
immunohistochemical staining.

Tissue microarray
Tumor tissues and paired normal lung tissues for
tissue microarray were obtained from formalin-fixed and
paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. The construction of
the tissue microarray was performed using an Alphelys
BoostArrayer device (Plaisir, France) as described in a
previous report [24]. Following staining with hematoxylin
and eosin, the sections of microarray for tumor and normal
tissues were examined by a pathologist for classification.

replicates in each were performed.

Immunoblotting analysis

Immunohistochemical staining and image
processing were performed as described previously
[24, 25]. In brief, after staining for Id1 the images were
captured by a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope (Tokyo,
Japan) and processed using Adobe Photoshop 8.0 software.
The positive Id1 immunostaining in the cytoplasm was
determined and scored by two independent experts under
the same examining condition. The results were divided
into four quartiles: score 1, ≤ 25% positive cells; score
2, 26%–50% positive cells; score 3, 51%–75% positive
cells; and score 4, ≥ 76% positive cells. Scores 1, 2 and
3 were categorized as low expression, and score 4 was
categorized as high expression for statistical analysis.

Immunoblotting analysis for protein expression was
carried out by Western blot as described previously [26],
and the chemiluminescent signal was captured by a UVP
BioSpectrum 500 imaging system (Upland, CA). Three
independent experiments were performed.

Immunoprecipitation
To
study
the
ubiquitination
of
Id1,
immunoprecipitation was performed by the Catch and
Release v2.0 Reversible Immunoprecipitation System
(Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Briefly, the harvested cells were washed with
ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended
in solubilization buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM
NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM
NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, and 1 μg/mL aprotinin). Insoluble
materials were removed by centrifugation (13,000 g, 10
min at 4°C), and the soluble cell lysates (1.5 mg) were
incubated with 4 μg of anti-Id1 antibody at 4°C overnight.
The Catch and Release column, which contained a
proprietary resin with high affinity for binding to the
antigen-antibody complex, were used to pull down the
protein samples. The column was then washed with saltfree wash buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholic
acid, and 15 mM imidazole), followed by centrifugation
(2,000 g, 1 min at room temperature). Immunoprecipitated
proteins were eluted from the resin by incubation with an
elution buffer provided by the manufacturer for 30 min at
37°C, followed by immunoblotting analysis. An aliquot of
the cell lysates (50 μg) was served as input control. Three
independent experiments were performed.

Cell culture
Three NSCLC cell lines (A549 lung epithelial
carcinoma, H460 lung large cell carcinoma, and H520
lung squamous cell carcinoma) were obtained from the
Bioresource Collection and Research Center (BCRC)
(Hsinchu, Taiwan). The genotypes and phenotypes of the
cell lines were authenticated by the BCRC. Cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10%
FBS and antibiotics. All cells were grown at 37°C in a 5%
CO2 incubator.

Stable transfection for Id1 overexpression
Full length cDNA for Id1 was cloned into the
pINCY vector backbone for fusion with the green
fluorescent protein (GFP) tag (Id1-GFP). H460 cells were
seeded on a 6-cm dish (Corning Life Sciences, Corning,
NY) at a density of 5.6×105 cells per dish and incubated
overnight at 37oC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. For each
transfection, 26.2 μL of lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) was added to 1413.5 μL of Opti-MEM
(Invitrogen) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature.
The diluted plasmid (7.1 μg) containing either Id1-GFP
or empty vector as control was mixed with lipofectamine
solution and incubated for 30 min at room temperature
before added to cells. The transfected H460 cells were
then grown in RPMI-1640 media with 1 μg/ml puromycin
for stable clone selection.

Nude mice xenograft study
All experiments involving mice were performed
according to the guidelines of the Animal Committee and
approved by the Institutional Review Boards of E-DA
Hospital and I-Shou University. Four-week-old female
immunodeficient (Foxnlnu/Foxnlnu) mice, obtained from
the National Science Council Animal Center of Taiwan,
were used in this study with the procedures reported in
a previous article [15]. Briefly, when the subcutaneously
implanted tumors became visible (approximately 50
mm3 in size), the mice were randomly assigned to be
treated intraperitoneally with PBS or paclitaxel (3 μg/g
body weight) plus cisplatin (5 μg/g body weight) every
other day for two weeks. Tumor sizes were measured by
calipers every other day and their volumes were calculated
according to the formula of (width2 × length)/2.

XTT colorimetric assay
Cell viability was determined by the method
of tetrazolium salt XTT assay (Roche Life Science,
Indianapolis, IN). After treatment for 48 h with paclitaxel
and cisplatin, the cell culture media were removed and
XTT assay was carried out as described in a previous
article [25]. Three independent experiments with six

All statistical analyses were performed using the
SPSS v19 statistical package for PC (IBM Corp., Armonk,
NY). Comparisons of the average tumor size between
the high and low Id1 expression group were analyzed by
two-sided Student’s t-test. Survival curves were generated
using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and the significance of
differences between curves was evaluated by the logrank test. Furthermore, hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) computed from univariate
and multivariable Cox regression models were used for
investigating the relationship between clinicopathological
characteristics and survival. Statistical significance was
accepted at P < 0.05.
