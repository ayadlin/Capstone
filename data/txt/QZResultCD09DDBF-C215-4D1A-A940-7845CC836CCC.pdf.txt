ABSTRACT
Mounting evidence supports the role of p53 in metabolic processes involved in
breast carcinogenesis. We investigated whether p53 status affects the association
of pre-treatment fasting glucose with treatment outcomes in 106 non diabetic, HER2
positive breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab. p53 status was validated
against gene sequencing of selected codons in 49 patients. The Kaplan–Meier method
and log rank test were used to compare survival by categories of fasting glucose
in the overall population and separate settings. Cox models included age and body
mass index. Direct sequencing confirmed the lack of mutations in 73.7% of p53
negative patients and their presence in 53.3% of p53 positive cases. At 66 months,
88.3% of patients with glucose ≤ 89.0 mg/dl (median value) did not experiment
disease progression compared with 70.0% in the highest category (p=0.034), with
glucose being an independent predictor (p=0.046). Stratified analysis confirmed
this association in p53 negative patients only (p=0.01). In the early setting, data
suggested longer disease free survival in p53 negative patients in the lowest
glucose category (p=0.053). In our study, p53 status acted as effect modifier of the
investigated association. This may help differentiate target sub-groups and affect
outcomes interpretation in similarly characterized patients.

evidence has provided support to the key role of p53 in
homeostatic regulation of metabolic processes involved
in carcinogenesis, including pathways related to glucose
metabolism. In the context of cell adaptation favoring
carcinogenesis, increasing attention has been paid to the
prevalence of aerobic glycolytic “Warburg” metabolism,
i.e., metabolic cell reprogramming for producing of
energy throughout glycolysis even under normal oxygen
concentrations. The loss of p53 generally favors the shift
from aerobic respiration to (aerobic) glycolysis. However,
p53 specific action on cancer metabolism might be driven
and ultimately established by a plethora of still poorly
characterized factors and inadequately explored pathways
[2-4].
Research in breast cancer has lately allowed to
characterize molecular features that have increasingly
become the targets for novel therapeutic interventions.
Trastuzumab has revolutionized the treatment of
patients with HER2 positive breast cancer. However,
approximately 10% of these patients develop a distant
recurrence following adjuvant trastuzumab-based
chemotherapy, and all patients with metastatic disease
eventually develop disease progression. The identification
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of biomarkers that are likely to predict which patients will
achieve the best response to this agent represents a major
challenge for oncologists [5].
Extensive pre-clinical and epidemiologic studies
substantiate the link between factors related to glucose
metabolism and breast carcinogenesis. Redundancy and
crosstalks among the numerous signaling networks that
regulate growth and survival in epithelial tumours are
present. Laboratory evidence supports the interaction
between factors related to glucose metabolism [e.g. fasting
glucose, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs)] and members
of the erbB tyrosine kinase family, such as HER2 [6, 7].
Moreover, in prospective cohort studies, diabetes and
increased glucose levels have been consistently associated
with an increased risk of breast cancer development [810].
We have recently focused on the predictive role
of pre-treatment fasting glucose in the development
of resistance to trastuzumab in non diabetic, HER2
positive breast cancer patients. Results from our study
showed significantly longer time to disease progression
in patients with lower levels of pre-treatment fasting
glucose compared to the highest tertiles [11]. In the

present study, we sought to investigate whether p53
immunohistochemical staining patterns might affect
the association between the biomarker of interest and
treatment outcomes in a well characterized subset of the
original study population.

Cancer patient characteristics by p53 status appear
in Table 3. Women testing negative at immunostaining
showed a significantly lower percentage of ki67 expression
compared with positive cases (42.3% vs. 57.7%, p=
0.023). No further relevant differences emerged.
Figure 1 shows time to disease progression
through categories defined upon the median value of
pre-treatment fasting glucose. In the overall population,
at 66 months, 88.3% of cancer patients in the lowest
glucose category did not experiment disease progression
compared with 70.0% in the highest category (p= 0.034).
We then stratified survival data by p53 status (Figure 2ab). In women testing negative at immunostaining, the
association between circulating levels of pre-treatment
fasting glucose was confirmed and statistically reinforced.
At 66 months, 91.3% of breast cancer patients whose
fasting glucose was below the median value showed no
evidence of disease progression, compared with 55.1%
in the highest glucose category (p= 0.010) (Figure 2a).
Conversely, the assessment of the association between
pre-treatment fasting glucose and treatment outcome in
patients testing positive at immunostaining revealed no

RESULTS
The characteristics of the 106 study participants
included in our analysis are shown in Table 1. The median
follow up was 28.8 months (1-128.3). Thirteen patients
(12.2%) were lost to follow up. Included variables are
related to the patients’ demographics, menopausal status
and metabolic profile (i.e., BMI, fasting glucose at
baseline and follow up) as well as to breast cancer features
at diagnosis (i.e., stage, molecular characteristics).
In Table 2, our study participants were compared
by categories of pre-treatment fasting glucose defined
upon the median value (i.e. 89.0 mg/dl). No significant
differences were observed across the categories examined,
neither by general characteristics nor by molecular
features.

In multivariate analysis including age at cancer
diagnosis and BMI as covariates, the predictive role
of pre-treatment fasting glucose on time to disease
progression was confirmed, (HR 6.35, 95%CI 1.04-38.90,
p= 0.046). The Cox model testing the interaction between
p53 status and BMI produced no significant results (p=
0.466) (Table 4).
Within the early setting, which included 81 women
who had received trastuzumab as neoadjuvant or adjuvant
treatment, survival estimates did not significantly differed
by glucose category (p=0.110). However, when stratifying
by p53 status, data were suggestive of longer disease

(Figure 3a-b-c). Of the 25 patients with stage IV breast
cancer at diagnosis, only two contributed events to our
analysis and were both located in the highest category of
fasting glucose. This made further analysis in the advanced
setting unfeasible.
Among the 49 breast cancer patients for whom
p53 immunohistochemical status was validated against
gene sequencing, 18 exhibited at least one missense
mutations (about 37%). More specifically, we observed
17 Arginina-Serine and 1 Arginine-Cysteine missense
mutations in codon 249 and 273, respectively. Overall,
results from gene sequencing confirmed p53 status as

DISCUSSION
In the present study, a set of analyses on a relatively
small, though very well characterized, group of 106 non
diabetic, HER2 positive breast cancer patients treated with
trastuzumab confirmed our previous findings concerning
the predictive role of pre-treatment fasting glucose on
treatment outcomes. Stratification of survival analyses by
p53 status allowed the distinction between two different
subpopulations. In p53 negative patients, the association
between fasting glucose and time to disease progression
was confirmed and the level of statistical significance

increased. This same association was not verified in
women testing positive at p53 immunostaining. Survival
data stratified by setting provided evidence of borderline
significant effect modification associated with p53 status
in the early setting.
Findings linking a systemic biomarker related to
glucose metabolism, i.e., pre-treatment fasting glucose,
to breast cancer outcomes are not novel. Indeed, large
and consistent evidence of better outcomes in breast
cancer patients with lower levels of fasting glucose
compared to the highest categories have come from a
number of observational studies [11,12-14]. Similarly,
previous studies have largely, though not always
consistently, documented the prognostic role of p53
in breast cancer [15-18]. Conversely, the predictive
role of immunohistochemically-assessed p53 status on
treatment outcomes in patients receiving trastuzumab has
been poorly documented and results do not seem to be
supportive [19]. However, to the best of our knowledge,
the hypothesis of a role of p53 as effect modifier of the

A

association between pre-treatment fasting glucose and
breast cancer outcomes has neither been formulated nor
(been) tested before in the clinical setting. Though still
highly speculative, characterization of p53 status might
contribute to better characterize the target population and
interpret treatment outcomes for interventions based on
trastuzumab administration in non diabetic patients and
inform decisions on co-interventions targeting glucose
metabolism. In case of confirmatory findings from future
studies in similarly characterized patients, it is conceivable
that lifestyle-related and pharmacological co-interventions
acting on glucose metabolism in women receiving
trastuzumab might possibly increase treatment efficacy
and translate into improved survival outcomes.
Immunohistochemical analysis of p53 expression
is widely accepted as a surrogate for mutational analysis
[20-23]. Yet, genomic DNA sequencing is the most
reliable technique in detecting gene mutations. However,
within the subset examined (i.e., 49 randomly extracted
breast cancer patients), raw agreement between results

from immunohistochemestry and sequencing was
quite satisfactory in the p53 positive group (53.3%)
and high in the p53 negative group (73.7%). Several
possible explanations might have contributed to
having not observed a perfect correlation between
immunohistochemical expression and TP53 mutations.
First, we examined a limited number of codons, namely,
175, 245, 248, 249 and 273, that are likely to identify
most, though not all, the mutated loci. Second, genetic
assessment of TP53 was performed on PETT at the time of
our study, while immunostaining was defined on distinct
tissues sampled at cancer diagnosis. Tumour heterogeneity
might have at least partly contributed to discrepancies in
our results [24]. Differences in raw agreement between the
two subgroups (i.e., p53 positive and negative) might also
be interpreted in light of the relatively low percentage of
HER2 Enriched (HER2E) subtype in p53 positive cases
(43.3%, i.e., 13/30) and (relatively) higher frequency of
Luminal B subtype in the p53 negative subgroup (63.2%,
i.e., 12/19). Indeed, TP53 mutations are quite often
represented in the HER2E subtype (72%), while are less
often encountered in Luminal B cancers (29%) [25].
Evidence supporting the role of p53 on patient
energy balance has recently emerged from an
observational study of 1060 colorectal cancers. In
nonobese patients (BMI<30 kg/m2) with p53 negative
tumours, specific mortality increased significantly. On the
contrary, p53 positivity was not associated with patient
survival outcomes in obese women (BMI≥30 kg/m2) [26].
These data seem to indicate that metabolic abnormalities
and excess energy balance underlying obesity might be
specifically detrimental in patients with p53 negative
tumors. In this and a previous study of ours, we included
BMI at baseline (prior to any treatment administration) in
Cox models testing the independent role of fasting glucose
on treatment outcome. Based on the recent findings from
Morikawa, we have now added an interaction term
between BMI and p53 status. Both the models produced
not significant results (p= 0.917 and 0.601 for BMI and
p53*BMI, respectively).
The effects of the burden of disease, as expressed
by cancer stage at diagnosis, on treatment outcomes
is intuitive. In the early setting, we could not observe
significantly different survival estimates until stratification
by p53 status was introduced. This may somewhat more
strongly support the role of p53 as effect modifier of
the association of interest. Indeed, notwithstanding the
reduced statistical power due to focusing on 81 patients
only, stratification by p53 status highlighted a borderline
significant advantage in terms of disease free survival
for women in the lowest category of fasting glucose.
Unfortunately, survival data related to the advanced setting
were poorly informative. Indeed, due to the insufficient
length of follow up at study closure, the number of
patients contributing events to our study was extremely
low (i.e., 2).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

At the cellular level, exposure to high fasting
glucose, particularly when occurring on a chronic basis,
introduces a source of metabolic disturbance which is
particularly well characterized in diabetic patients [27].
There is substantial evidence on the role of p53 as a
key mediator in cell metabolic adaptation. Activation of
p53 induced by metabolic stress is mainly, though not
exclusively, driven by AMPK-dependent phosphorylation
via LKB1 and mostly influenced by mTOR [28-33]. p53
and mTOR are linked by extensive cross talk. p53 governs
vital cell functions including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest
and senescence. Its anti-aging effects are mediated by
growth-promoting pathways such as PI3K/mTOR, which
converts cell cycle arrest into senescence. p53 can exert
inhibitory effects on the mTOR pathway, as shown by
decreased activity of mTOR in tissues of p53-/- mice [3435]. At the metabolic level, p53 mediates several effects
including inhibition of glycolysis and stimulation of fatty
acids. mTOR is a nutrient-sensing pathway [35-37]. In
mice fed ad libitum, mTOR is continuously activated,
whereas calorie restriction decreases mTOR activation
and partially relieves the loss of p53. Administration of
the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycine delays tumour onset in
cancer-prone p53+/- and p53-/- mice [38]. In addition, there
is large and consistent evidence supporting a multiple
level interaction between p53- and the HER2-mediated
signaling, also involving the p53 downstream CKI p21,
p53 inhibitor Mdm2 and the tumour suppressor PTEN.
However, this study does have some limitations. We
analyzed data from a relatively limited sample. Sample
size limitations became even more evident when working
on subgroups defined upon breast cancer setting. We are
fully aware of the need of exploring our hypothesis in
larger, ad hoc designed and possibly prospective studies
which may adequately represent differences by setting.
However, patients included in our analysis were very
well characterized by molecular features. In addition, our
laboratories’ accreditation to ISOs 9001 together with the
availability of control protocols for HER2 characterization,
increase our confidence in data quality [34] [39].
Novelty is probably the main strength of our study.
Our first time finding provides support to the role of p53
status as effect modifier of the association between pretreatment fasting glucose and treatment outcomes in a well
specified molecular subtype of breast cancer, i.e., HER2
positive, in non diabetic patients treated with trastuzumab.
Given the current availability of low cost interventions
related to glucose metabolism (e.g. life style, metformin),
this pipeline might rapidly lead to future studies with
innovative hints in terms of increasingly well defined
target population and efficacy outcomes. The validation
study performed on a subset of the 106 patients included
along with the satisfactory degree of agreement between
results from p53 immunostaining and TP53 sequencing,
particularly in p53 negative patients, increases the
reliability of our results.

In summary, we provide novel evidence on a
widely used biomarker, namely, p53 immunostaining,
as a bridging element between a systemic indicator of
the glycemic body asset (fasting glucose) and treatment
outcomes in a relatively small historic cohort of non
diabetic, HER2 positive breast cancer patients treated
with trastuzumab. The shift from investigating an
association whose terms have long been somewhat generic
to shaping study design and data analysis according
to specific patient- and disease-related features might
lead to increased specificity and, ultimately, efficacy of
interventions based on trastuzumab administration and
co-interventions targeting glucose metabolism in breast
cancer.

METHODS

The immunohistochemical assessment of estrogen
(ER) and progesterone (PgR) receptors as well as
HER2, Ki-67 and p53 status was performed in formalinfixed paraffin-embedded tissues using the monoclonal
antibodies (MoAbs) 6F11, 1A6 (Menarini, Florence,
Italy), the polyclonal antibody A0485 (PoAb, Dako,
Milan, Italy), the MoAb MIB-1 (Dako) and the MoAb
DO7 (Dako), respectively. Two micron-thick sections were
stained with a streptavidin-enhanced immunoperoxidase
technique (Supersensitive Multilink, Menarini) in an
automated autostainer (Bond Max, Menarini) using a
pH 6 citrate buffer antigen retrieval protocol for all the
antibodies used throughout the study.
Assessment of the HER2 gene and Chromosome 17
status were performed by using a fully automated single
color in situ hybridization assay based on a validated silver
deposition technology (SISH, Inform HER2 DNA Probe;
Inform Chr17 probe, Roche Diagnostics, Milan, Italy).
The silver precipitation was visualized as a black dot in
cell nuclei. The 100x oil immersion objective was used to
score signals in all the neoplastic cells. SISH results were
analyzed by using a light microscope (Nikon, Eclipse 55i)
equipped with a software able to capture images (Eureka
Interface System, Menarini, Firenze, Italy).

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Silver in situ
hybridization (SISH)

Study Participants and Settings
Included patients were 106 non diabetic, HER2
positive breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab
for whom data on p53 immunohistochemical staining
patterns were available. These patients were a subset of
a larger historic cohort of 202 breast cancers included in
a previous analysis. Extensive details concerning study
participants and setting for the main study were reported
elsewhere [11]. In brief, breast cancer patients were
considered suitable for inclusion if they had received
trastuzumab according to the indications released by
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (http://
www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/
HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/
ApprovalApplications/TherapeuticBiologicApplications/
ucm080591.htm; http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/
druginfo/fda-trastuzumab). We posed no restrictions by
breast cancer setting, neither did we in reference to the
administration schedule. We excluded patients diagnosed
with either type I or type II diabetes based on laboratory
data and those whose pre-treatment fasting glucose was
equal to or higher than 126 mg/dl [35] [40].

Scoring criteria for IHC
ER, PgR, and p53 were considered positive when
≥10% of the neoplastic cells showed a distinct nuclear
immunoreactivity whereas Ki67, based on the median
value of our series, was regarded as high if ≥15% of the
cell nuclei were immunostained. Bcl2 was recorded as
positive when tumor cells exhibited a strong homogeneous
cytoplasmic immunoreaction in more than 30% of
neoplastic cells. HER2 IHC positivity was determined
according to ASCO-CAP guidelines and revised
according to the most recent update [36-37] [41-42] and
was scored as follows: 0 (no staining or membrane faint
incomplete staining in <10% tumor cells) and 1+ (faint
incomplete membrane staining in <10% tumor cells)
negative, 2+ (weak to moderate incomplete/complete

Data Retrieving
For each patient a specifically trained research
assistant retrieved data on demographics, anthropometrics
[i.e. body mass index (BMI) at baseline and at the end
of follow up], clinical features at diagnosis (e.g. stage of
disease), administered therapy and treatment outcomes.

complete staining in >10% cells) positive. Tumors with
a 2+ staining were defined negative or positive according
to gene amplification. Evaluation of the IHC results was

(MI). Collected data were evaluated throughout the the
CHROMAS  Analysis Software.

Statistical Analyses
We examined distributions and computed
descriptive statistics for all the variables of interest. We
described the study participants’ features and reported
them through categories of pre-treatment fasting glucose
and by p53 status. We used means and standard deviations
for continuous data as well as frequencies and percentage
values for categorical data. Existing differences between
mean values were evaluated using the T- Student. We used
the Pearson’s Chi-squared test of independence (2-tailed)
to assess the relationships between categorical variables.
We performed survival analyses using the KaplanMeier product-limit method and applied the Log-rank
test to compare the survival curves by categories of
pre-treatment fasting glycaemia. In the overall study
population, time to disease progression was calculated
as the interval between the date at first administration
and (the date at) disease progression, last follow-up
or death, whichever came first. Stratification by stage
at diagnosis allowed for analyses separately including
data from the neoadjuvant and adjuvant (early) and
metastatic (advanced) setting, with disease free survival
and progression free survival being the outcomes of
interest, respectively. Survival curves were stratified by
p53 staining pattern (p53 negative vs. positive) in the
overall study population and subgroups defined by disease
setting (early vs. advanced). The Cox proportional hazard
model was used to further test the predictive role of fasting
glucose on patient important outcomes in multivariate
analyses. Age and BMI at cancer diagnosis were included
as covariates. Based on recent evidence supporting the
interaction between p53 status and BMI in cancer, an
interaction term was added to the Cox model [26, 38] [43].
We considered p values less than 0.05 statistically
significant. All statistical analyses were performed with
the SPSS statistical software version 21 (SPSS inc.,
Chicago IL, USA).

Scoring Criteria for SISH
According to the ASCO-CAP guidelines (36),
tumors were defined as “non-amplified” (NA) by SISH
when a HER2 gene copy number <6 was observed. Cases
were defined as “amplified” (A) when SISH displayed
a gene copy number >6. Polysomy 17 - intended as
an increased CEP17 copy number (CEP17CN) – is
considered to be present in BC when a mean number of
≥3 signals is shown.

p53 Status: validation against DNA sequencing
in a subset of 49 randomly selected breast cancer
patients
Immunohistochemical p53 status was validated
against gene sequencing in a randomly selected subset
of 49 breast cancer patients from the 106 included in the
present study. Patient selection was driven by a computer
generated randomization list. The number of included
patients resulting positive and negative at immunostaining
were 30 and 19, respectively. The lab personnel involved
in gene sequencing was blind to p53 status as assessed by
immunohistochemistry.

DNA extraction and Sequencing
DNA was extracted from 10 μ paraffin-embedded
tumor tissue (PETT) sections after macrodissection
using the DNA extraction kits QIAmp DNA kit (QiagenExplera, Jesi, Italy) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. About 100-200 ng of genomic DNA was
used in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the
genomic region of TP53 harboring the higher mutational
percentage, i.e., the hot spots 175, 245, 248, 249 and 273
codons within exons 5, 7 and 8. The following primers
