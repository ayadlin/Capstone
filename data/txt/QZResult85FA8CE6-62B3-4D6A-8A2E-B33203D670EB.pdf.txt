BACKGROUND. Innovative epigenetic therapeutics comprise histone deacetylase
inhibitors (HDAC-I) and demethylating agents (DA). It was recently found that
HDAC-I compounds exhibit profound therapeutic activities against hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). A comprehensive preclinical investigation was performed
on the potential of a combined HDAC-I/DA epigenetic regimen for the highly
chemotherapy-resistant HCC entity.
METHODS. Human HCC-derived cell lines or primary human hepatocytes (PHH)
were treated with HDAC-I compound suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) or
DA compound 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) or both and examined for cellular damage, proliferation, histone acetylation pattern, and DNA methylation. In
vivo activities were investigated in a xenograft hepatoma model.

substantial antiproliferative effects in HCC-derived cells, strongly enhanced by

damage. In vivo testing demonstrated a statistical significant inhibition of
hepatoma cell growth for the combined treatment regime.

CONCLUSIONS. Because the combined HDAC-I/DA epigenetic approach was
found to produce significant antitumor effects in HCC model systems and did
not impair cellular integrity of untransformed hepatocytes, this combination
therapy is now considered for further investigation in clinical trials. Cancer

he possibility to modulate epigenetic alterations of tumor cells,
such as the acetylation pattern of DNA-associated histone proteins by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC-I) or the methylation
of cellular DNA by substances with demethylating activity (DA),1–3
opens up fascinating new treatment options, in particular for those
tumors that exhibit an inherent resistance to cytostatic agents, as
for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).4,5
In human-derived HCC tumor tissues, compared with nonmalignant liver tissue, aberrant DNA methylation patterns have been
described for several genes such as SOCS-1,6–8 p16INK4A,9,10 cyclin
D2,6 APC,6,7 E-cadherin and p15INK4B,7 GADD 45,11 HAI-2/PB,12 or
ASCL.13 To our knowledge, the exact contribution of these methylation patterns to the development and maintenance of hepatoma
cells has not been determined yet in detail. Notably, atypical
methylation patterns have also been found in precancerous lesions

of the liver6 and have been correlated to the extent
and severity of liver fibrosis.14
5-azacytidine (Vidaza; Pharmion, Boulder, Co)
and 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC; decitabine),
constitute prototype DNA methylation inhibitor compounds that can be incorporated into the cellular
DNA.15 Both substances, 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-dC,
have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome in 2004 and 2006, respectively. Once
incorporated, they are recognized by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) during replication, thereby
leading to a widespread genomic hypomethylation.16,17 The results of a recent Phase I trial demonstrated that a continuous infusion of 5-aza-dC is well
tolerated in patients with solid tumors, paving the
way for future clinical trials employing DA.18
First-generation HDAC-Is, such as the short
chain fatty acid MS-275, the cyclic peptide depsipeptide (FK-228), or suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid
(SAHA), are currently being tested in Phase I/II clinical trials in hematologic malignancies and some solid
tumors, but not yet in patients harboring HCC.3,19–21
Several early studies reported that a remodeling of
the chromatin structure by HDAC-I might be a promising concept to treat HCC.22–24 Our own results
addressing HCC-derived cells show that valproic acid
(VPA) exhibits profound HDAC-I activity,25,26 and
that a new compound called ITF2357 selectively inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of hepatoma
cells.27 Furthermore, we found an HDAC-I induced
preferential killing of tumor cells by natural killer
cells28 and a sensitization to the apoptosis-inducing
ligand TRAIL.27 Thus, HDAC-I seems to be an attractive new treatment option for HCC.
Molecular links between the modification of
histone proteins and the methylation of DNA have
led to the idea of combining both principles as a new
epigenetic combination strategy in cancer; however,
the exact molecular mechanisms of an enhancement
of the antitumoral activity compared with each substance alone is not yet completely understood.2,29–33
In the meantime, early clinical studies mainly addressing toxicity issues could demonstrate the feasibility
of such an approach.34,35
In the current study, we investigated the effects
of the DA substance 5-aza-dC alone or in combination with the HDAC-I compound SAHA (both drugs
being currently employed in Phase I/II clinical trials)
on human hepatoma cell lines as well as on primary
human hepatocytes (PHH). To preclinically explore
this new HCC treatment strategy, both single and
combination regimens were also evaluated in a
human hepatoma xenograft model.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and Cells
5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC; Sigma-Aldrich,
Taufkirchen, Germany) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; Italfarmaco, Milan, Italy) were both
dissolved at a concentration of 10 mM. PHH were
kindly provided by T.S. Weiss according to Thasler
et al.36 and cultured as described.27,37 Hep3B and
HuH7 cells were maintained in Dulebecco modified
Eagle medium (DMEM) (10% fetal calf serum [FCS]),
and HepG2 in MEM and DMEM (3:1; 10%FCS).
Media and supplements were from Life Technologies
(Rockville, MD).

Sulforhodamin B Cytotoxicity Assay
Hep3B, HepG2, and HuH7 cells were seeded in 12well plates (2 3 104 cells/well). One day later, medium was added containing 5-aza-dC, SAHA, or both;
treatment was performed for 5 days, and the medium was changed once after 48 hours. Growth inhibition was evaluated by sulforhodamin B (SRB)
assay38; data plotted represent the mean of optical
density measurements related to untreated cells
(100% cellular protein content). In an analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with factors 5-aza-dC, SAHA, cell
line, and all interactions, we tested contrasts between
5-aza-dC monotreatment and combinations with
SAHA for each cell line and the system of contrasts
(JMP IN 5.1 software; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

Methylation-Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction
Semiconfluent HepG2 or HuH7 cells were treated
with 5-aza-dC, SAHA, or both substances and 48 hours
later an extraction of genomic DNA (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany, DNeasy protocol) was performed. The bisulfite modification of genomic DNA was performed as
described with some minor modifications.39 In brief,
genomic DNA (1 lg) was denatured in 50 lL by
NaOH (0.2 M final concentration) for 20 minutes at
428C. Next, 30 lL of 10 mM hydroquinone (Sigma
Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo) and 520 lL of 3 M
sodium bisulfite (Sigma) (pH 5.0) were added and the
sample was incubated for 18 hours at 608C. DNA was
purified (Qiagen PCR Purification Kit) and eluted into
250 lL of water; 125 lL of NaOH (1 M) then were
added and incubated for 15 minutes at 378C, followed
by ethanol precipitation. A methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using
previously described primers for the genes SOCS-17
and p16INK4A.39 Each PCR product was analyzed on a
2% agarose gel.

HDAC Inhibitor Screening
Histone deacetylase inhibition activity was determined in triplicate according to the Cayman Chemical
HDAC Activity/Inhibitor Screening Assay Kit protocol
(Cayman Chemical by Biozol, Eching, Germany).
Western Blot Assays
Western blot assays were performed as described40
employing rabbit anti-acetyl-histone H3 antibody
(Ac-H3), 1:20,000 (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany), and
anti-vinculin antibody, 1:5000 (Sigma-Aldrich). Acetyl-Histone H3 levels were estimated by performing a
densitometric analysis; values are shown relative to
untreated controls.
Cytotoxicity Assay for Human Hepatoma Cell Lines
and PHH
PHH were cultured for 3 days in 12-well plates (4 3 105
cells/well). Hep3B, HepG2, and HuH7 cells were
seeded in 12-well plates (1 3 105 cells/well). The next
day, 5-aza-dC, SAHA, or a combination of both, were
added. After 48 hours, culture media were collected
and analyzed using commercial procedures for activity
of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Sigma TOX7 In Vitro
Toxicology Assay Kit; Sigma-Aldrich) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST).41
Animal Treatment Protocol
Five-week-old female BALB/cOlaHsd-Foxn1nu mice
(Harlan-Winkelmann, Borchen, Germany), housed
under pathogen-free conditions, received an inoculation of 1 3 107 HuH7 hepatoma cells into the right
flank. When palpable tumors became detectable,
animals were divided randomly to 4 groups: intraperitoneal injection of vehicle only (control group), 5aza-dC (1 mg/kg), SAHA (50 mg/kg), or a combination of 5-aza-dC (1 mg/kg) and SAHA (50 mg/kg).
Tumor volumes were estimated according to the
formula V ¼ L 3 W2 (in which L indicates length and
W indicates width) at the start of the treatment regimen (designated Day 1) and then from Day 3 on
daily. Animals were sacrificed by carbon dioxide
asphyxiation either when the tumor size reached
20 3 20 mm or at the end of treatment (Day 12).
Individual 3-parametric logistic curves were fitted to
cubic roots of tumor volumes in a hierarchical nonlinear mixed model with log-normal rates and days
of half-maximal effect using WinBUGS 1.4. The
Dunnett test was performed on individual posterior
means at Days 0 and 10. All animal experiments were
performed in agreement with the laws of the German
government concerning the conduct of animal ex-

local ethics committee for animal experimentation.

Histologic Analysis
Completely removed tumor specimens from the
xenograft mouse investigation with adjacent liver tissue were fixed in 4% buffered formalin for 24 hours
and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections were performed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The
histologic analysis was performed by a pathologist in
a blinded fashion.

5-Aza-dC in Human Hepatoma-Derived Cell Lines
To investigate the antiproliferative capacity of 5-azadC in the context of HCC 3 well-characterized human
hepatoma cell lines (Hep3B, HepG2, and HuH7) were
incubated with different concentrations of 5-aza-dC
(5–50 lM); after 5 days of continuing treatment an
SRB cytotoxicity assay was performed. The viability
of all hepatoma cell lines tested was found to be significantly reduced at all concentrations employed,
being most prominent for HuH7, followed by HepG2

fitted by hyperbolic curves decreasing to asymptotes
of 50%, 59%, and 62%, respectively. Remarkably, the
observed antiproliferative effect did not increase
substantially when concentrations higher than 5 lM
of 5-aza-dC were used (Fig. 1). Compared with
untreated control cells, viability for 5 lM 5-aza-dCtreated HuH7, HepG2, and Hep3B cells was calculated to be 60%, 70%, and 77%, respectively. We
chose the lowest investigated dose of 5-aza-dC of
5 lM as a standard dose for all further experiments.

Enhanced Antiproliferative Activity Achieved by
a Combination of a DNA Methylation Inhibitor
and an HDAC Inhibitor
Previously we could show that compounds with
HDAC-I activity inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of human hepatoma cells.41 To test for possible synergistic effects of HDAC-I compounds (such
as SAHA) with DNA methylation inhibitor compounds
(such as 5-aza-dC), HepG2, Hep3B, and HuH7 cells
were either incubated with SAHA, 5-aza-dC, or a
combination of both. After 5 days of treatment target
cell viability was determined by an SRB cytotoxicity
assay. Notably, the combination treatment employing
both epigenetic modulators, SAHA and 5-aza-dC,
induced the most prominent reduction of viability in
all cell lines tested (Fig. 2, fourth bars [filled] from
the left). Compared with the viability score of a treatment with 5-aza-dC only (Fig. 2, second bars [filled]
from the left), the combined treatment approach led
to a significant further reduction of the viability score
in all 3 hepatoma cell lines (Fig. 2) (P ¼ .023 for
HuH7, P < .001 for Hep3B, P < .001 for HepG2). Combination treatment with SAHA and 5-aza-dC demon-

151 bp for p16INK4A) generated by primers being specific for the unmethylation state of the target DNA. Bands found to be visible in ‘‘M’’ lanes represent methylated DNA products (160 bp for SOCS-1; 150 bp for p16INK4A)

strated a cell line-independent inhibition of viability
(P < .0001).

Maintenance of Epigenetic Modulation Capacities
in a Combined Treatment Approach
Next we investigated a possible interference of 5-azadC with SAHA and vice versa by choosing 2 welldescribed model genes, known to be inactivated in
human hepatoma cells by methylation, namely,
SOCS-18 and p16INK4A.9,10 Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-1) is known to be unmethylated in
HuH7 cells but its inactivation via methylation has
been attributed to an important role in the development of HCC.8 p16INK4A is 1 of the most important
tumor suppressor genes. It is well examined that
p16INK4A is methylated in HuH7 and faint methylated
in HepG2 cells and that the methylation contributes
to the process of hepatic carcinogenesis.10 In the absence of both compounds (baseline control) SOCS-1
displayed a strong methylation pattern in HepG2
cells (Fig. 3A, upper panel, Lanes 1 and 2) and a very
faint methylation pattern in HuH7 cells (Fig. 3B,
upper panel, Lanes 1 and 2), whereas p16INK4A was
methylated in HuH7 cells (Fig. 3B, lower panel,
Lanes 1 and 2), but not in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A, lower
panel, Lanes 1 and 2). These findings agree with the
current literature. Neither treatment of HepG2 nor
HuH7 hepatoma cells with the HDAC inhibitor SAHA

in the presence of 5-aza-dC. (A) HDAC activity was determined in nuclear extracts of HeLa cells by a fluorescence-based assay kit. The percentage of HDAC inhibition in the presence of 5-aza-dC (5 lM), SAHA (2 lM), or a combination of both substances (5-aza-dC, SAHA) was calculated relative to the acetylation activity of nuclear HeLa cell extracts in the absence of any HDAC-I compound (control).

alone caused any substantial changes in the methylation patterns of SOCS-1 or p16INK4A (Fig. 3A and B,
Lanes 5 and 6). As expected, treatment with 5-azadC induced a partial demethylation of SOCS-1 in
HepG2 (Fig. 3A, upper panel, Lanes 3 and 4) and of
p16INK4A in HuH7 cells (Fig. 3B, lower panel, Lanes 3
and 4). Furthermore, the faint methylation pattern of
SOCS-1 in HuH7 cells was completely resolved in the
course of treatment with 5-aza-dC (Fig. 3B, upper
panel, Lane 4). Importantly, combined treatment of
HepG2 or HuH7 hepatoma cells with 5-aza-dC plus
SAHA did not result in a change of the demethylating
activity induced by 5-aza-dC alone (Fig. 3, Lanes 7
and 8 vs. Lanes 3 and 4). These results demonstrate
that SAHA does not substantially interfere with the
overall demethylating activity induced by 5-aza-dC.
Next we looked for a relevant influence of the
DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-dC on the HDAC-I
activity exerted by SAHA with a fluorescence-based
in vitro assay using standardized nuclear extracts of
HeLa cells (Fig. 4A). As a result, the evident inhibition of HDAC enzyme activity of >70% did not
appear to differ if treated with SAHA alone or with
SAHA plus 5-aza-dC (Fig. 4A, Bars 3 and 4). In contrast, the treatment of nuclear extracts with 5-aza-dC
alone showed no inhibition of HDAC enzyme activity
(Fig. 4A, Bar 2). In addition to these hepatoma cellfree experiments, Western blot analysis of treated
Hep3B cells and PHH were performed. Hep3B cell

extracts demonstrated that H3 histone proteins were
hyperacetylated when treated with SAHA alone (Fig.
4B, Lane 3) or SAHA plus 5-aza-dC (Fig. 4B, Lane 4),
but not when treated with 5-aza-dC alone (Fig. 4B,
Lane 2) or mock-treated (Fig. 4B, Lane 1). Notably,
cell extracts of PHHs that had been treated simultaneously either with 5-aza-dC or SAHA alone or a
combination of both did not show any relevant
changes in the H3 histone protein acetylation pattern
(Fig. 4C); this finding is in keeping with our previous
observation of a differential response pattern of malignant and nonmalignant liver cells with respect to
HDAC-I treatment.41 Taken together, these experiments show that SAHA and 5-aza-dC both maintained specific epigenetic modulation capacities in a
combined treatment approach.

Lack of HDAC-I/DA Combination Regimen
Toxicity in PHHs
To investigate unwanted side effects potentially limiting the transfer of our innovative HDAC-I/DA treatment approach into the clinic, we first incubated
PHH cells for 48 hours only with 5-aza-dC (employing
increasing concentrations of up to 50 lM), subsequently measured the cellular integrity by an LDH
release assay and cellular damage by an AST release
assay in the cellular supernatant (Fig. 5A), and fitted
a straight line. As a result, we did not find any relevant increases of the LDH (slope 0.0017; 95% confi-

(A) Primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) were treated for 48 hours with various concentrations of 5-aza-dC; subsequently, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) release into the supernatant fluid compared with untreated controls was determined. (B) PHH were
treated for 48 hours with various concentrations of SAHA alone, or with a combination of 5-aza-dC (5 lM) and SAHA; subsequently, relative LDH and AST

PHH, showing that 5-aza-dC, even in high concentrations, is well tolerated in this cell type.
Next the toxicity of our combined HDAC-I/DA
treatment approach was investigated by incubating
PHH cells with 5 lM 5-aza-dC plus increasing concentrations of SAHA (up to 4 lM). Interestingly, SAHA
treatment alone did not lead to a relevant increase in
LDH or AST release in a linear regression fit (Fig. 5B,
gray lines, left side and central diagram). These
changes of the enzyme activities for each curve in
Figure 5B fit a flat linear regression curve with no
significant changes of the slopes from zero. Furthermore, an SRB assay using increasing concentrations
of SAHA in the presence or absence of 5-aza-dC did
not show any relevant reduction in viability (Fig. 5B,
right side). In contrast to these observations in non-

malignant PHHs, all 3 hepatoma cell lines (Hep3B,
HepG2, and HuH7) demonstrated an increase of
LDH release when increasing amounts of SAHA were
applied (Fig. 5C, black lines). This effect was found
to be most prominent for HepG2 and HuH7 cells.
In summary, whereas PHH cells were found
to tolerate treatment with 5-aza-dC alone or in
combination with SAHA quite well, human-derived
hepatoma cell lines showed substantial cellular damage undergoing our epigenetic treatment approach.

In Vivo Activity of a Combined Epigenetic Treatment
Finally, our epigenetic combination regimen was
tested in a xenograft hepatoma model. For this purpose, nude mice harboring subcutaneously implanted
HuH7 xenografts were treated intraperitoneally with
either 1) 5-aza-dC, 2) SAHA, 3) a combination of
both, or 4) placebo (control group) (Fig. 6).

As a result, animals in the control group (injection of vehicle only) showed large tumors at treatment Day 12 (Fig. 6, vehicle line, depicted in red);
at this point the animals were sacrificed because
tumor volumes reached the maximum size admitted
by the treatment protocol. Animals in both single
treatment groups with either 5-aza-dC (Fig. 6, blue

DISCUSSION
The discovery that epigenetic alterations contribute
substantially to both development and maintenance
of human malignancies defines the chromatin structure and DNA methylation status as legitimate sets
of targets for the development of new cancer therapy
approaches.21 This evidence has led to the first FDA
approval of an HDAC inhibitor for the treatment of
cancer in 2006 (ie, SAHA for use in cutaneous T cell
lymphoma), and the approval of 2 demethylating
substances, 5-azacytidine (Vidaza) and 5-aza-dC (decitabine) for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). 5-aza-dC was further found to have
activity in a broad range of hematologic disorders
such as acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia;
however, to our knowledge, the majority of clinical
data have been gathered for the treatment of MDS,
with a recent Phase III clinical trial including 170
patients demonstrating clinical efficacy by documented durable responses, including 9% complete
responses, and improved time to the development of
acute myelogenous leukemia or death.42
In the present study, we investigated the potential of a combined epigenetic treatment of HCC

Epigenetic Therapy of HCC/Venturelli et al.

employing a DNA demethylating substance in combination with an HDAC-I compound. This endeavor
was stimulated by several observations that define
a special role of epigenetic alterations in the HCC
context: 1) the repression of growth-regulating genes
in HCC-derived cell types by DNA methylation,8–10 2)
antiproliferative and hepatoma cell-specific proapoptotic effects exerted by HDAC-I activity,22,41 and 3) a
proven interaction of DNA methyltransferases with
cellular HDAC enzymes leading to the silencing of
cellular regulatory genes.2,33,43
In an earlier study, we described a hepatoma
cell-specific antiproliferative effect exerted by the 2
HDAC-I substances VPA and ITF2357.41 Moving forward from this, we now demonstrate also that a DNA
methylation inhibitor compound, 5-aza-dC, induces
a substantial inhibition of hepatoma cell proliferation. Interestingly, the combination of DNA methylation inhibition (5-aza-dC) together with HDAC
inhibition (SAHA) led to an attractive synergistic
therapeutic effect, suggesting that 2 dissimilar epigenetic mechanisms (DNA methylation inhibition,
HDAC inhibition) do not substantially interfere on a
molecular level. This assumption is supported by the
determination of the HDAC activity in nuclear
extracts or the acetylation status of DNA associated
histone proteins and by the determination of the
methylation status of 2 model genes, SOCS-1 and
p16INK4A.
Interestingly, current concepts suggest 1) that
either DNA methylation may be responsible for
the ‘‘locking in’’ of defined genes into a silenced,
hypoacetylated chromatin state33,44 or 2) that histone
modifications are even able to determine DNA methylation patterning.45 Taking these multiple interactions between these 2 different epigenetic
modifications in cancer cells into account, combinatorial epigenetic modulation regimes seem to be an
ideal target for future therapeutic strategies.
Recently, it was described that VPA not only
exhibits an inherent HDAC-I activity, but also exerts
a replication-independent DNA demethylating activity.46 This observation raised speculations that
HDAC-I might generally lead to a replication-independent demethylation, too, but this dual molecular
activity was not reported for other substances with
HDAC-I activity as yet. In our experiments it is of interest that SAHA did not change the methylation
status of SOCS-1 or p16INK4A, but 5-aza-dC did. Notably, these 2 methylation-silenced genes play a crucial
role in the carcinogenesis of HCC.8,10
Each new therapeutic option of HCC requires an
in-depth analysis of unwanted toxicities to surrounding normal, nonmalignant hepatocytes. For the first

2139

time we have tested the application of an epigenetic
combination regime on primary human-derived liver
cells and did not find any toxicity in doses considered clinically relevant. This important preclinical
result is supported by recent clinical studies in which
the application of either 5-aza-dC or HDAC-I
compounds did not provoke any dose-limiting liver
toxicity.18,47,48 For substances with HDAC-I activity,
World Health Organization grade 1 or 2 liver toxicities have been reported in trials applying MS-27549
or VPA only when given in combination with all-trans
retinoic acid,50 but not for VPA alone51 or SAHA.52
Most notably, we could substantiate our in vitro
experiments with the results of an animal experiment.
The epigenetic combination regimen tested in a
xenograft hepatoma model demonstrated the most
prominent inhibition of tumor growth, whereas the
single compound treatment equally reduced the
tumor growth at a lower level. These findings are
congruent with the results of the proliferation assays
and support the effort for further investigations in
clinical trials.
To our knowledge to date, clinical trials making
use of a combination of a demethylating substance
and an HDAC-I compound have only been reported
in the context of a pharmacokinetic study,34,35 but
efficiencies of such combinatorial therapeutic approaches for solid tumors (including HCC) have not
yet been investigated. Therefore, a combination of
these epigenetic drugs for HCC seems to be a novel,
logically founded step that should be evaluated
further.43
