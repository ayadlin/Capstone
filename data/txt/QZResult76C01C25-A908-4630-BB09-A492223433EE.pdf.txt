Abstract
The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1 receptor (IGF1R) is an important therapeutic target under study in
many cancers. Here, we describe a breast cancer model based on expression of the ETV6-NTRK3 (EN) chimeric
tyrosine kinase that suggests novel therapeutic applications of IGF1R inhibitors in secretory breast cancers.
Originally discovered in congenital fibrosarcomas with t(12;15) translocations, EN was identified subsequently in
secretory breast carcinoma (SBC) which represent a variant of invasive ductal carcinoma. Because fibroblast
transformation by EN requires the IGF1R axis, we hypothesized a similar dependency may exist in mammary
cells and, if so, that IGF1R inhibitors might be useful to block EN-driven breast oncogenesis. In this study, we
analyzed EN expressing murine and human mammary epithelial cell lines for transformation properties. Various
IGF1R signaling inhibitors, including the dual specificity IGF1R/insulin receptor (INSR) inhibitor BMS-536924,
were then tested for effects on three-dimensional Matrigel cell growth, migration, and tumor formation. We
found that EN expression increased acinar size and luminal filling in Matrigel cultures and promoted orthotopic
tumor growth in mice. Tumors were well differentiated and nonmetastatic, similar to human SBC. The known
EN effector pathway, PI3K-Akt, was activated in an IGF1- or insulin-dependent manner. BMS-536924 blocked EN
transformation in vitro, whereas BMS-754807, another IGIFR/INSR kinase inhibitor currently in clinical trials,
significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo. Importantly, EN model systems mimic the clinical phenotype
observed in human SBC. Moreover, EN has a strict requirement for IGF1R or INSR in breast cell transformation.
Thus, our findings strongly encourage the evaluation of IGF1R/INSR inhibitors to treat EN-driven breast cancers.

Introduction
The IGF1R signaling axis is emerging as an essential pathway for many cancers, including breast carcinoma, and inhibitors of this pathway are in various stages of clinical
development. IGF1R is normally activated by insulin-like
growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF1 and IGF2), which trigger a

myriad of intracellular signaling cascades including the
PI3K-Akt and Ras-ERK pathways (reviewed in refs. 1, 2).
Antireceptor (3) or anti-IGF antibodies (4), IGF1R or IGF
antisense (5), or dominant-negative IGF1R mutants (6) block
oncogenic transformation of tumor cell lines in vitro and in
vivo. Perhaps, most compelling is the observation that almost
all known dominantly acting oncogenes require a functional
IGF1R axis to transform cells, including activated Ras, c-Src,
SV40 large T, and oncogenic protein tyrosine kinases (PTK;
refs. 7–9). As with EN, other translocation-associated chimeric
oncoproteins, such as EWS-FLI1 and variant EWS fusions of
Ewing family tumors and PAX3/7-FKHR of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, are incapable of transforming Igfir/ murine
embryo fibroblasts (MEF; ref. 10).
IGF1R overexpression in mammary epithelial cell lines
disrupts acinar morphogenesis (11), and transgenic mice
expressing constitutively active IGF1R develop mammary
tumors at an early age (12). In human breast carcinoma,
immunostaining for tyrosine phosphorylated IGF1R was
recently identified in all subtypes and corresponds to poor
survival (13). Therefore, IGF1R appears to represent an important therapeutic target for a wide variety of breast cancer

Blocking IGF1R Signaling in ETV6-NTRK3 Breast Cancer

subtypes. Several humanized blocking antibodies are currently in clinical trials for different tumor types including
breast cancer (14–16). However, resistance to these agents is
being reported, although IGF1R mutations have not been
described. Other candidate mechanisms for resistance include
receptor overexpression or increased ligand production (17).
Moreover, IGF1R can synergize or physically interact with
other receptors such as INSR (18), ER (19), and the EGFR
family (20). In fact, it was recently shown that in murine
IGF1R-dependent pancreatic b-cell neuroendocrine carcinogenesis, blocking IGF1R fails to reduce tumor burden unless
INSR is simultaneously inactivated (21). Therefore, INSR activation may contribute to IGF1R oncogenesis and resistance to
IGF1R inhibitors.
The ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion is present in virtually all cases
of secretory breast carcinoma (SBC; ref. 22). SBC is a rare form
of infiltrating ductal carcinoma accounting for less than 1% of
all breast cancers and is classified within the basal-like
category of breast cancers (23). To date, EN is the only known
translocation-associated oncoprotein in human breast cancer.
SBC tumors harbor t(12;15) translocations identical to the
those originally described in congenital fibrosarcomas (24)
and congenital mesoblastic nephromas with EN fusions (25).
This fusion was also recently reported in a new subtype of
salivary gland tumor known as mammary analogue secretory
carcinoma of salivary glands (MASC; ref. 26). The t(12;15)
translocation in all of these tumors fuses sequences encoding
the sterile a motif (SAM) domain of the ETS transcription
factor, ETV6 (TEL), to the PTK domain of the neurotrophin-3
receptor, NTRK3 (TRKC). The SAM domain promotes EN
polymerization and subsequent ligand-independent PTK activation (27). EN binds to and phosphorylates the insulin
receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS1 and IRS2; ref. 10), which
bridge EN to the Ras-ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways (28), both of
which are essential for fibroblast transformation (22). In ENtransformed fibroblasts, Ras-ERK activation results in cyclin
D1 upregulation and proliferation whereas the PI3K-Akt pathway supports cell survival (22). EN requires IGF1R for fibroblast transformation, in particular for activating PI3K-Akt in
cells to suppress anoikis under anchorage-independent conditions (29). Igf1r/ MEFs are resistant to EN transformation
but this is restored by reexpressing IGF1R or targeting EN to
the membrane, suggesting that IGF1R may localize EN to the
membrane (29).
Sustained EN expression in murine breast epithelial cells
promotes tumor growth in immunodeficient mice, and breast
tumors rapidly develop in EN knockin transgenic mice (30).
However, the role of IGF1R in EN breast oncogenesis remains
unknown. Therefore, we wished to determine if a similar
IGF1R dependency exists for EN-mediated mammary epithelial cell transformation as observed in fibroblasts, and whether
targeting IGF1R might be a tractable therapeutic strategy for
EN-driven breast cancers. Moreover, as EN is a bona fide
oncoprotein in human breast cancer, EN-transformed breast
epithelial cells may provide novel insights into the role of
IGF1R in breast oncogenesis. We, therefore, generated new in
vitro and in vivo EN-based breast cancer model systems to
further investigate the link between EN mammary transfor-

mation and IGF1R signaling. Our results indicate an essential
role for IGF1R in EN breast cell oncogenesis. Moreover, we
provide evidence that either IGFs or insulin can support this
activity, consistent with a parallel or complimentary role for
INSR in EN breast cell transformation.

Materials and Methods
Compounds
PI3K was inhibited using LY294002 (25 mmol/L; Calbiochem). MEK1/2 was inhibited using U0126 (25 mmol/L; Calbiochem). BMS-536924 is a benzimidazole compound with
nanomolar potency against IGF1R and INSR (31, 32). BMS754807 is a pyrrolotriazine compound that also inhibits both
IGF1R and INSR kinase activity and is currently in clinical
trials (33). BMS-536924 was used at 100 nmol/L concentrations for in vitro assays, and BMS-754807 as described in the
section on in vivo tumor models.
Cell culture
MCF10A and MCF10ATk1 cell lines (from Dr. F. Miller) were
cultured as described (34). EpH4 cells were obtained from
Martin Oft (Schering-Plough Biopharma) and grown as
described (22). All cell lines were tested routinely for their
ability to respond to basement membrane by undergoing
alveolar morphogenesis and to express differentiated protein
products, such as the mouse milk protein b-casein, or epithelial markers such as E-cadherin. Cell lines were engineered via
retroviral transduction to stably express control (MSCVpuro)
and EN (ENpuro) as described (22). Lentiviral vectors carrying
luciferase and a blasticidine selectable marker were used to
infect MCF10A and MCF10A-EN cells.
Three-dimensional cultures
Monolayer EpH4 cells were serum and insulin starved for 24
hours prior to trypsinization and plating onto Matrigel (BD
Biosciences). For overlay cultures, EpH4 cells were placed on
polyHEMA-coated dishes for 8 hours and then clusters were
collected, mixed in 1% Matrigel containing media, and plated.
Cells were fed every 48 hours and collected at various time
points and processed for Western blotting or immunofluorescence.
BrdU incorporation assays
Cells were serum and insulin starved for 24 hours and then
plated on polyHEMA (4 mg/mL)-coated dishes for 5 hours and
were allowed to form naked clusters. Cell clusters were mixed
with media containing 1% Matrigel per 5 mg/mL insulin or 100
ng/mL IGF-1, plated, and grown for 3 to 5 days. Spheroids were
incubated for 1 hour with BrdU labeling reagent and stained
according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche).
Immunofluoresence microscopy
EpH4 cells were grown on glass coverslips in 3-dimensional
(3D) cultures as described above, and fixed using standard
procedures. The following antibodies were used: E-cadherin
(1:500; Transduction Labs), bcatenin (1:250; Abcam), ZO-1
(1:250; Zymed), and Ki67 (1:200; Santa Cruz). Images were

collected using a BioRad Radiance plus confocal unit connected Zeiss Axiophot II microscope. Images were analyzed
using NIH image software.
In vivo tumor models
Orthotopic mammary fat pad injections were performed as
previously described (35). When EpH4-EN tumors reached a
measurable size, 100 mg/kg/d of BMS-754807/PEG400/dH2O
(80:20) or vehicle alone was administered daily by oral gavage
for 7 consecutive days. Measuring continued 15 days past the
final treatment. Tumor mass calculation ¼ L  W2/2. Error
bars ¼ SD of the mean for 8 tumors.
Tumor histology
Tumors were fixed and embedded using standard protocols. Three-dimensional spheroids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed with 70% EtOH, embedded in agar and then
in paraffin. Five-micrometer cut sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). A Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope
and Northern Eclipse (ver5.0) software was used for image
capture.
Boyden chamber assays
Boyden chamber assays were performed as previously
described (35). Experiments were performed in triplicate
and percentages of migrated cells were calculated on the
basis of standard curves generated for each cell line.
Time-lapse wound-healing migration assays
Wound-healing assays were performed as previously
described (35).
Western blotting
Lysates were prepared and EN was immunoprecipiated as
described previously (22). The following antibodies were used
for Western blotting: b-casein, cyclin D1 (Clone 504; 1:2,000;
Upstate), Grb2 (1:5,000; BD Biosciences), TrkC (1:500; Santa
Cruz), phospho Akt (ser473; 1:1,000; Cell Signaling), phospho
MEK1/2 (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), total Akt (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), INSRb (1:1,000; Santa Cruz), IGF1Rb (1:1,000; Santa Cruz),
IRS-1 (1:1,000; Santa Cruz), and total actin (1:5,000; Santa
Cruz).
Comparison of BMS-536924 with BMS-754807 using soft
agar colony assays
Soft agar assays were performed as previously described
(36). Increasing nanomolar concentrations of inhibitor were
tested (see Supplementary Fig. S4A). ImageJ Analysis Software
and a macro (Matthew Robertson) were used to calculate the
percentage of colonies formed after 7 days. Three independent
experiments were performed. Error bars ¼ SEM.
siRNA-mediated gene knockdown
siRNAs to murine INSR and IGF1R (murine INSR Cat: J043747; IGF1R Cat: J-056843) and human INSR (Cat: J-003014;
Dharmacon) were transfected with Silentfect (BioRad), followed 72 hours later by evaluation for knockdown efficacy or
plating in 3D Matrigel cultures.

Results
EN transforms murine EpH4 breast epithelial cells in
3D Matrigel cultures and renders them tumorigenic in
immunodeficient mice
Stable expression of EN in EpH4 cells (EpH4-EN) was
confirmed by Western blotting in 2 independently developed
cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A). No clear difference in
phenotype or downstream signaling pathways was apparent
in control versus EN-expressing cells in conventional monolayer cultures (Supplementary Fig. S1B). However, in 3D
Matrigel-containing cultures, striking phenotypic and signaling changes were observed. Multicellular spheroids generated
by EpH4-EN cells were 2 to 3 times larger (Fig. 1A, top),
exhibited increased Ki67 staining (Fig. 1A, bottom) and
showed partially filled lumens (Fig. 1B, right and Fig. 1D,
bottom left). Similar to nontransformed cells, EpH4-EN cells
showed intact adherens junctions (AJ), as assessed by Ecadherin and b-catenin staining, and tight junctions (TJ) as
assessed by ZO-1 staining (Fig. 1A and B). EpH4-EN cells
responded to lactogenic hormones by expressing b-casein
(Fig. 1C). Western blotting of lysates from 3D EpH4-EN cells
revealed higher levels of phospho-Akt, phospho-MEK, and
cyclin D1 (Fig. 1C), as described previously for EN-transformed
fibroblasts (36). Together, these results indicate that although
EN expression increases proliferation and affects luminal
formation, it does not disrupt polarity or differentiation status
of transformed cells in vitro.
We previously showed that when injected subcutaneously
into the flanks of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice, EpH4-EN
cells form stable xenografts (22). We next compared the
histology of these EpH4-EN xenografts as well as of EpH4EN 3D spheroids with those of tumors from EN knockin
transgenic mice (11) and human SBC cases, as shown in
Figure 1D. This demonstrated a number of morphologic
similarities among the 4 specimens. Each showed characteristic lumens lined by multicellular epithelial surfaces, with
varying degrees of luminal filling. The similarity to human SBC
was particularly evident in the EpH4-EN 3D spheroids. These
results support the use of EpH4-EN in vitro and in vivo model
systems to study EN breast oncogenesis.
EN transforms human MCF10A breast epithelial cells
and promotes orthotopic tumor formation in vivo
To establish a human model system for EN transformation,
we utilized the MCF10A cell line model (37). MCF10A cells are
derived through spontaneous immortalization of breast
epithelial cells from a patient with fibrocystic disease and
do not form persistent xenografts in immunocompromised
mice. A second cell line, MCF10ATk1, expresses activated Hras and produces hyperproliferative lesions but is nonmetastatic in immunodeficient mice (34, 38). EN was retrovirally
transduced into both cell lines and expression was confirmed
by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). Although indistinguishable from
control MCF10A and MCF10ATk1 cells in monolayer cultures,
EN-expressing MCF10A (MCF10A-EN) cells formed large acini
similar in size to MCF10ATk1 cells in 3D cultures (Fig. 2B,
bottom). In contrast, enlarged acini were not observed in 3D

cultures in EN-expressing MCF10ATk1 cells (MCF10ATk1EN), which instead generated distinctive phenotypic changes
in both monolayer and 3D cultures similar to what is observed
when the Y-box protein-1 (YB-1) protein is overexpressed in
MCF10ATk1 cells (see Fig. 2B and ref. 35, and the next section).
We next injected MCF10A-EN cells into mammary fat pads of
immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice. This resulted in the formation of stable xenografts that grew slowly and were nonmetastatic over the 4-month monitoring period (Fig. 2C).
Therefore, MCF10A-EN cells also provide useful in vitro and
in vivo model systems to study EN breast oncogenesis.
EN fails to induce a full EMT and only minimally
increases cell migration
As mentioned, MCF10ATk1-EN cells produced a refractile
and spindle-shaped appearance in monolayer cultures. When
plated in Matrigel, these cells possessed a mesenchymal-like
spindle-shaped phenotype and did not form multicellular
spheroids. This is reminiscent of cells undergoing an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a well-described pro-

cess that facilitates epithelial cell migration and metastasis
(reviewed in ref. 39). EMTs are characterized by decreased
epithelial markers including E-cadherin, ZO-1, cytokeratin 18
(CK18), and mucin 1 (MUC1); and increased expression of
mesenchymal proteins such as vimentin, N-cadherin, fibronectin, a-smooth muscle actin (SMA), CK14, and p63. We,
therefore, assessed expression of selected EMT markers in
MCF10A-EN and MCF10ATk1-EN cells by Western blotting
(Fig. 3A) and immunofluorescence (Fig. 3B). As a positive
control, we used MCF10ATk1 cells overexpressing the cold
shock domain RNA/DNA binding protein, YB-1, which induces
a robust EMT in MCF10ATk1 cells and renders them highly
metastatic (35). MCF10ATk1-YB-1 cells are invasive in 3D
cultures and possess very low levels of E-cadherin and
increased expression of vimentin, N-cadherin, and other
EMT proteins (ref. 35 and Fig. 3A and B). In contrast,
MCF10A-EN and MCF10ATk1-EN cells showed only slight
to moderate decreases in E-cadherin and minor changes in
ZO-1 and no vimentin induction (Fig. 3A and B). Boyden
chamber assays were next used to determine migration rates

of serum-starved MCF10-EN and MCF10ATk1-EN cells in
response to serum or serum-free media containing IGF1 or
insulin as chemoattractants. As shown in Figure 3C, although
there was a slight increase in MCF10-EN or MCF10ATk1-EN
cells versus parental cell lines, effects were dramatically less
than for MCF10ATk1-YB-1 cells. Taken together, these results
suggest that despite certain morphologic changes, EN does
not induce a full EMT in MCF10A or MCF10ATk1 cells. Timelapse photomicroscopy was then used to track the movement
of control EpH4 versus EpH4-EN cells. No significant migration differences were observed in the absence of serum or
growth factors (Supplementary Fig. S2). In the presence of
serum or serum-free media plus IGF1, there were slight
increases in track length (distance traveled) and random
movement for EpH4-EN cells compared with control cells
(Fig. 3D, top and middle). Taken together, these results
suggest that although EN induces minor migratory increases
in response to serum or IGF1, it fails to induce a highly
invasive phenotype, in keeping with the low metastatic behavior of SBC.
EN requires IGF1R/INSR signaling and Akt activation to
transform breast epithelial cells
We next wished to determine if any of the observed EN
effects on breast epithelial cell transformation require IGF1R
signaling, as this axis is critical for EN fibroblast transformation. We first analyzed growth of EpH4-EN cells in 3D
Matrigel cultures with or without IGF1 (100 ng/mL) or insulin
(5 mg/mL), given that IGF1R and INSR share numerous
downstream signaling elements (40). EN expression markedly

1064

increased spheroid sizes and luminal filling, but only when
IGF1 or insulin was present (see Fig. 4A). In fact, in the
absence of growth factors, EpH4-EN cells failed to grow
and could not be further assessed experimentally (data not
shown). We next performed Western blotting of EpH4 cells
from 3D cultures grown in the presence of IGF1 or insulin. At
early time points, there was no obvious correlation between
EN expression and PI3K-Akt or Ras-ERK activation (shown
for the 2-hour time point in Fig. 4B, left). However, by 96
hours, EN-expressing cells began to exhibit higher levels of
phospho-Akt and cyclin D1 compared with parental cells
(Fig. 4B, right). A similar pattern was previously observed in
MCF10A-EN cells (ref. 30 and data not shown). To further
explore effects of IGF1R/INSR signaling on EN mammary cell
transformation, spheroid cultures were labeled for 1 hour
with BrdU, fixed, stained, and visualized by confocal microscopy. The percentage of BrdU-positive spheroids was calculated by counting spheroids possessing greater than 4 BrdUpositive cells (Fig. 4C). Similarly, the percentage of spheroids
possessing hollow lumens was calculated by scoring DAPI
(nuclear)-stained spheroids using confocal microscopy
(Fig. 4D). Consistent with the above results, EpH4-EN spheroids were larger than EpH4 controls (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S1), and the increased size and BrdU staining
was only observed in the presence of IGF1 or insulin. Approximately, 40% of EpH4-EN spheroids possessed greater than
4 BrdU-positive cells under full serum, compared with only
8% when cultured in serum-free media. Addition of IGF1 or
insulin alone to serum-free medium increased the latter
percentage to 21% and 31%, respectively. Significantly less

conditions.
We next assessed effects of specific siRNAs to IGF1R or INSR.
Knockdown of IGF1R and INSR was confirmed in monolayer
cultures (Fig. 5A, left). In 3D cultures, knockdown of either
receptor blocked luminal filling (Fig. 5A, right), and when used
in combination, dramatically decreased EpH4-EN spheroid
sizes (see Fig. 5B). By Western blotting, there was no effect
of knockdown on EN effector pathways in monolayer cultures
(data not shown). However, in 3D lysates, knockdown of either
or both receptors decreased Akt phosphorylation and cyclin
D1, (Fig. 5A, right). Knockdown with siRNAs to INSR also
decreased spheroid size, decreased pAkt and cyclin D1 levels
in MCF10A-EN cells in 3D cultures (Supplementary Fig. S4A
and S4B). Because insulin was also able to support growth of
EN-transformed cells in 3D cultures, we wondered whether the
insulin effects were mediated through INSR or IGF1R. Interestingly, we found that insulin could activate IGF1R in both ENtransformed and parental fibroblasts (Supplementary

insulin was able to activate both INSR and IGF1R in MCF10A
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). More studies are required to
elucidate whether insulin functions through IGF1R or INSR, or
indeed through both receptors, such as via cross-talk between
IGF1R and INSR (ref. 40; see the Discussion section).
We also tested effects of BMS-536924, a dual, specific
IGF1R/INSR kinase inhibitor, or the PI3K inhibitor
LY294002. Both inhibitors markedly decreased EpH4-EN
spheroid sizes in 3D cultures (Fig. 5C, left; Supplementary
Fig. S6A). LY294002 treatment decreased BrdU incorporation
and reduced cyclin D1 levels whereas inhibition of MEK
activity using U0126 had only a small effect (Supplementary
Fig. S6 and Table S1). Moreover, BMS-536924 also decreased
the length of EpH4-EN cell tracks in response to IGF1 stimulation (Fig. 3D, bottom), suggesting that IGF1R and/or INSR
activation may influence migration of EN-transformed breast
epithelial cells. Finally, when EpH4-EN cells were injected

significantly decreased tumor volumes when administered for
7 days by oral gavage (Fig. 5D). Together, these findings
strongly indicate that growth factor stimulation of the
IGFR/INSR axis stimulates proliferation of EpH4-EN spheroids
via an Akt-dependent mechanism, and that blocking these
receptors inhibits growth of EpH4-EN cells in vitro and in vivo.
IRS-1 interacts with ETV6-NTRK3 in vivo
We previously demonstrated an essential role for the IGF1R
adapter protein, insulin-like growth factor substrate-1 (IRS-1),
in EN-mediated transformation of fibroblasts (28). To determine whether IRS-1 may also interact with EN in breast
epithelial cells, we immunoprecipitated EN from tumor tissues collected from 2 primary SBC cases, as well as breast
tumors from ETV6-NTRK3 knockin transgenic mice (30). In all
cases, IRS-1 was found to coimmunoprecipitate with the EN
fusion protein (Fig. 6A and B). This indicates a role for IRS-1 in
EN transformation and may also provide the link between the
IGF1R and downstream PI3K-Akt activation in SBC.

Discussion
Although, our understanding of the role of oncogenic fusions
in epithelial tumors has increased in recent years (41), identification of the ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion as a primary genetic
event in SBC (22) remains the only known example of a
dominantly acting oncogene in human breast carcinoma.
Using 3D cell culture systems as well as orthotopic tumor
models, we demonstrate here that EN expression transforms
both murine and human breast epithelial cell lines. Further
characterization revealed that although EN expression leads to
higher proliferation rates with luminal filling and increased
acinar sizes, EN spheroid cells remain polarized, are relatively
well differentiated, and do not display prominent migratory/
invasive capacity in keeping with the clinical behavior of
human SBC. We confirmed an essential role for the IGF1R/
INSR axis in EN breast cell transformation and demonstrated a
critical requirement for this axis in activation of the PI3K-Akt
cascade and upregulation of cyclin D1. Moreover, we show that,
similar to EN-transformed fibroblasts, EN binds IRS-1 in SBC
tumors. These findings demonstrate the utility of in vitro and in
vivo model systems of EN transformation to study breast cell

many aspects of the SBC phenotype and highlight the potential
for therapeutically targeting IGF1R/INSR pathways in SBC.

mately 40% of breast cancer cases (42). Furthermore, the role
of cyclin D1 in rapid breast cell growth is underscored by the
observation that in cyclin D1 knockout mice, alveolar lobular
cells fail to expand during pregnancy (43–45). Activation of the
IGF1R/INSR axis is associated with recruitment of members of
the IRS family of adaptor proteins, and subsequently, proteins
such as Shc, Grb10, 14-3-3, and the PI3K p85 subunit (reviewed
in refs. 1, 46). In particular, IRS1 and IRS2 contain binding sites

for Grb2 and PI3K, and function as links to key downstream
signaling pathways including Ras-Erk and PI3K-Akt cascades.
EN interacts physically with IRS-1 in EN-positive murine
breast tumors and human SBC, as it does in EN-transformed
fibroblasts, indicating an important role for this adaptor in EN
transformation of breast epithelial cells. How exactly EN
utilizes its interaction with IRS-1 to link to Ras-Erk and
PI3K-Akt cascades, and how this might involve IGF1R,
remains to be determined. It is tempting to speculate that
EN may physically associate with IGF1R through IRS-1, but
this requires experimental validation.
The ability of EN to transform fibroblasts requires a functional IGF1R axis, as exemplified by EN's inability to transform
Igf1r/ MEFs (10). However, in EN-transformed fibroblasts,
IGF1R is not required for cyclin D1 induction or cell progression, as the latter are induced through the Ras-Erk pathway
independently of IGF1R (29). Instead, IGF1R activation correlates with increased Akt-dependent cell survival in EN-transformed fibroblasts, particularly under anchorage-independent
conditions (29). In contrast, when mammary EpH4-EN spheroid cultures were treated with the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002,
cell proliferation was dramatically inhibited, correlating with
complete loss of cyclin D1 expression. These results are
consistent with other studies demonstrating that expression
of constitutively active Akt in mammary epithelial cells leads
to translational upregulation of cyclin D1/2 (47). Hence, there
may be fundamental differences in the role of IGF1R in
supporting EN transformation of mesenchymal cells versus
breast epithelial cells, which may have important implications
for targeting IGF1R in different tumor types. Further studies of
such differences may also reveal key insights into the overall
role of IGF1R/INSR signaling in oncogenesis.
We found that both IGF1 and insulin could support 3D
growth of EN-transformed breast cells and induced cyclin D1

expression and cell proliferation. There are several possible
explanations for this finding. One is that either IGF1R or INSR
activation can support EN breast cell transformation. For
example, promiscuity may exist in the activation of signaling
cascades downstream of either receptor, such as PI3K-Akt,
which may allow either IGF1R or INSR to induce cyclin D1
expression in EN-transformed cells. In a recent mouse model of
IGF1R-dependent pancreatic b-cell neuroendocrine carcinogenesis, inactivation of both IGF1R and INSR was required to
reduce tumor burden (21). This was interpreted as indicating
either a role for IGF2-mediated activation of INSR or, conversely, insulin-mediated activation of INSR itself, in IGF1R
oncogenesis, and that INSR signaling may functionally underlie
resistance to IGF1R inhibition. On the other hand, accumulating evidence highlights the existence of heterodimers between
IGF1R, and INSR, particularly the isoform A form of the latter
that is known to be overexpressed in certain cancers such as
breast carcinoma (40, 48). These hybrid receptors can be
activated by insulin as well as by IGFs. Therefore, heterodimer
formation may occur in EN-transformed cells as a second
explanation for the observed insulin effects on EN transformation. Thirdly, because insulin can activate IGF1R at high doses
such as those used in our studies, the insulin effects may be
occurring through IGF1R activation. In fact, we observed that
insulin induced IGF1R tyrosine phosphorylation in EN-transformed fibroblasts and parental MCF10A breast epithelial cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). This effect is consistent with
our observation that EN fails to transform Igf1r/ MEFs (10),
which still express INSR. More studies are required to elucidate
the basis of insulin effects on EN transformation.
Disruption of cell–cell contacts during EMT is a wellestablished feature of invasive epithelial tumor cells (reviewed
in ref. 49). In the current study, we found that EN expression
alone is not sufficient to disrupt cell–cell junctions, reduce Ecadherin, or to induce a full EMT. In fact, a polarized acinar
cell phenotype is maintained in 3D cultures. Activation of
ErbB2 in differentiated mammary acini also leads to the
reinitiation of cell proliferation to form noninvasive multilayered spheroids, generating a phenotype similar to ENexpressing cells. However, unlike EN, ErbB2 activation also
leads to loss of acinar polarization (50), and this lack of
organization appears to be a precursor to subsequent invasive
capacity and cancer progression. In SBC, tumor cells retain
polarized multilayered glandular structures, and these tumors
only very rarely metastasize (23). EN expression in EpH4 or
MCF10A cells did not induce an invasive phenotype in 3D
cultures, and IGF1 induced limited migration of EN-expressing cells only in wound-healing assays but not in Boyden
chambers. Therefore, EN expression alone is likely insufficient
for inducing a highly migratory phenotype, in keeping with the
predominantly nonaggressive clinical behavior of SBC. This
lack of appreciative migratory capacity in EN-transformed
breast cells is somewhat surprising given that deregulation of
growth factor and PI3K signaling pathways are both known to
disrupt cell–cell junctions and to induce an invasive phenotype in many cell types (51–54). Why this does not occur in ENtransformed breast cells is completely unknown, but argues
that additional genetic events must occur to execute a full

EMT and to confer a metastatic phenotype. Alternatively, EN
may itself repress such pathways through an unidentified
mechanism. It will be of great interest to assess rare metastatic SBC tumors for genetic events that might underlie
aggressive clinical behavior. Early stages of breast cancer,
such as hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ, are characterized by an increase in luminal cell proliferation, loss of
acinar organization, and luminal filling as observed for ENtransformed mammary epithelial cells. Therefore, EN breast
tumors may model early breast cell transformation as opposed
to progression, and the model systems described here may be
particularly useful for determining genetic or epigenetic steps
necessary for the transition to invasive carcinomas.
In summary, our studies provide evidence that although
EN robustly initiates cell proliferation in breast epithelial
cells, it does so without blocking differentiation or inducing
an invasive phenotype, thus mimicking the morphologic
features of SBC. Our findings confirm the importance of
IGF1R/INSR activation in EN breast cell transformation, as
well as the importance of PI3K in this process. However, in
contrast to what is observed in EN-transformed mesenchymal cells, IGF1R/INSR signaling is required for PI3K-AKT–
mediated cyclin D1 induction and proliferative effects of EN
on breast cells. Finally, our in vitro and in vivo results using
BMS-536924 and BMS-754807 suggest that it may be possible

to treat EN-expressing breast cancers with IGF1R/INSR
kinase inhibitors. Such tumors typically occur in very young
patients in which invasive surgery can have dramatic longterm cosmetic side effects, highlighting the need for alternative modes of therapy.
