BACKGROUND: The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine whether patients who had metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) p.G13D mutation (an amino acid substitution at position 13 in KRAS from a glycine to an aspartic acid) and received cetuximab treatment had better clinical outcomes than
patients who had mCRC tumors with KRAS codon 12 mutations. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by a search of MEDLINE,
EMBASE, the Chinese Biomedical Database, and Wan Fang Digital Journals from inception to October 2011. The primary clinical outcomes included the objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The pooled relative risk
(RR) or hazard ratio (HR) was estimated by using fixed-effects or random-effects models according to heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: Ten studies were considered eligible that included 1487 patients with mCRC. Patients who had tumors with the KRAS
p.G13D mutation had a significantly higher ORR (10 studies; RR, 1.642; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.131-2.384), longer PFS (1 study;
HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36-0.81), and longer OS (1 study; HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33-0.80) than patients who had tumors with KRAS codon 12
mutations. Compared with patients who had KRAS wild-type tumors, patients with the p.G13D mutation had a significantly lower
ORR (9 studies; RR, 0.540; 95% CI, 0.381-0.765) and nonsignificantly shorter PFS (1 study; HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.68-1.45) and OS
(1 study; HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.66-1.54). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who had mCRC with the KRAS p.G13D mutation appeared to benefit
more from cetuximab than patients who had tumors with KRAS codon 12 mutations. However, because of the limited sample sizes in

INTRODUCTION
The immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)—cetuximab—has
proven effective in combination with chemotherapy or as a single agent for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) who are refractory to irinotecan-based treatment.1-4 However, resistance to cetuximab is common,
and only 10% to 20% of patients truly benefit from the treatment.4,5 Recently, it has been widely demonstrated that
mutations in v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) codons 12 and 13 are major predictive biomarkers for resistance to cetuximab treatment.6-9 With reference to these findings, the European Medicines Agency10
and, subsequently, the US Food and Drug Administration11 have suggested that patients who have mCRC with KRAS
codon 12 and codon 13 mutations should be excluded from cetuximab treatment.
However, studies indicate that not all KRAS mutations are equivalent in their biologic characteristics. First, an in
vitro study indicated that KRAS codon 13 mutations (mainly the p.G13D mutation) exhibit weaker transforming activity
than codon 12 mutations.12 Second, a few patients who have tumors with KRAS mutations occasionally respond to antiEGFR treatment.1,13,14 The tumors from those responsive patients predominantly harbored codon 13 mutations, and all
codon 13 responders have p.G13D mutation. These findings indicate that the KRAS p.G13D mutation and KRAS codon
12 mutations may have a different effect on cetuximab efficacy.
Although, until now, the effect of KRAS mutations as a whole has been reported in several studies, it makes little
sense to interpret estimates of the effect of KRAS mutations when codon 12 and codon 13 mutations are considered separately. To date, only 3 studies (1 published full-text article15 and 2 abstracts16,17) have compared the efficacy of cetuximab

KRAS p.G13D mutation, KRAS codon 12 mutations, and
wild-type KRAS; methods for detection of KRAS mutations status; lines of treatment; study treatment regimen;
response criteria; overall response rate (ORR); PFS; OS;
and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI)
for the comparison of PFS and OS. Data on ORR, PFS,
and OS were extracted separately according to KRAS
mutation status (KRAS p.G13D mutation, KRAS codon
12 mutations, and wild-type KRAS, if possible).
Aggregate data were extracted from 3 studies15-17 that
compared the efficacy of cetuximab treatment patients with
p.G13D mutations and codon 12 mutations. Individual
data were extracted from 7 studies6,13,14,18-21 that included
the available data for ORR but did not perform a comparison between 2 groups of patients.

treatment between patients who have tumors with the
KRAS p.G13D mutation and those who have tumors with
KRAS codon 12 mutations. Except for those 3 studies,1517
there also were some other studies from which individual data could be extracted on this topic, although those
studies did not compare patients with the p.G13D mutation and patients with codon 12 mutations. Those studies
provided us with an opportunity to perform a systematic
review and meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of cetuximab treatment among patients who had mCRC with
KRAS p.G13D mutations, KRAS codon 12 mutations,
and wild-type KRAS. We hope the findings from this
study will help clarify the influence of the KRAS p.G13D
mutation on clinical outcomes of cetuximab treatment.

A comprehensive computerized literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Chinese Biomedical Database, and
Wan Fang Digital Journals was performed from inception
to October 2011. Following search terms were used to
identify relevant studies: metastatic colorectal cancer (eg,
‘‘metastatic colorectal cancer,’’ ‘‘metastatic colon cancer, ’’
‘‘metastatic rectal cancer’’, ‘‘mCRC’’), monoclonal antibodies (eg, ‘‘monoclonal antibodies,’’ ‘‘MoAb,’’ ‘‘MAbs,’’
‘‘cetuximab’’), KRAS (eg, ‘‘KRAS,’’ ‘‘K-RAS,’’ ‘‘G13D’’).
All eligible studies were retrieved, and their bibliographies
were checked for further relevant publications. If the same
patient population was used in more than 1 publication,
then only the publication with the most relevant data was
used in this systematic review.
Inclusion Criteria

Studies that met all of the following 4 criteria were considered eligible: 1) the patients studied had mCRC; 2) treatment consisted of cetuximab monotherapy or cetuximab
in combination with other agents for any line of treatment; 3) KRAS was used as a biomarker; and 4) the outcomes included at least 1 of following stratified according
to KRAS mutations status (p.G13D mutation and codon
12 mutations): objective response (the sum of complete
responses and partial responses), progression-free survival
(PFS), and overall survival (OS).
Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed independently by 2
researchers, and disagreements were resolved by discussion between them. Unsettled disagreements were settled
by a third researcher, whose opinions were final. The following data were collected from each study: first author’s
name; year of publication; study design; demographic
Cancer

The quality of each study was assessed independently by 2
reviewers using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).22
The NOS consists of 3 parameters for the quality of
cohort study: selection, comparability, and outcome. The
NOS assigns a maximum of 4 points for selection, 2
points for comparability, and 3 points for outcome. Studies with NOS scores >6 were consider high quality. Any
discrepancies between 2 reviewers were settled by a third
reviewer.
Statistical Methods

The primary endpoints in the current analysis included
ORR, PFS, and OS. The association between KRAS
p.G13D mutations and the ORR was expressed as the relative risk (RR) of patients with p.G13D mutations versus
patients with KRAS codon 12 mutations. The association
of the KRAS p.G13D mutation with PFS and OS was
expressed as a hazard ratio (HR) for patients with
p.G13D mutations over patients with KRAS codon 12
mutations. In addition, we compared the efficacy of
cetuximab treatment between patients who had tumors
with the KRAS p.G13D mutation versus those who had
wild-type KRAS tumors.
Before combining data, heterogeneity was assessed
using a Cochran Q test with degrees of freedom equal to
the number of analyzed studies minus 1.23,24 If the P value
for the Cochran Q test was >0.10, which suggested that
the variation in the results may have arisen purely from
chance, the pooled RR or HR would be estimated by
using a fixed-effects model (the Mantel-Haenszel
method).25 Otherwise, heterogeneity was deemed significant; and a random-effects model (the DerSimonian and
Laird method) would be used.26

Original Article

Subgroup analyses were performed according to the
line of treatment (first-line treatment vs second-line or
subsequent treatment) and treatment regime (monotherapy vs combined therapy). Sensitivity analyses were
performed to determine whether ethnicity, sample-size,

methodologic quality, or response criteria would affect
the final results. Begg funnel plots and Egger linear regression tests were used to assess the possible presence of publication bias.27 If publication bias existed, then the Duval
and Tweedie nonparametric ‘‘trim-and-fill’’ method was
used to estimate the ‘‘unbiased’’ effect.28 All statistical
tests that were used in our systematic review were conducted using MetaAnalyst Beta 3.13 statistical software
(Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Mass).
RESULTS
Search Results

Figure 1 illustrates the process of identifying eligible
articles for the analysis. The search in bibliographic databases yielded 1046 citations. After a review of titles and
abstracts, we excluded 943 nonrelevant citations. The 103
remaining citations were classified as potentially relevant
and were subjected to full-text assessment. We excluded
93 more articles that did not meet our inclusion criteria.
Thus, 10 studies (2 abstracts16,17 and 8 full-text
articles6,13-15,18-21) were included in the final analysis,
of which 10 articles6,13-21 were included in the analyses of
ORR and 3 articles15-17 were included in the analyses
of PFS or OS.

Quality-Assessment Results

One study15 had an NOS score of 9, 7 studies6,13,14,18-21
had an NOS score of 7, and 2 studies16,17 had an
NOS score of 6. Eight studies6,13-15,18-21 (80%) were of
high quality (NOS score >6), and the average NOS score
was 7. The most common bias was observed in the
comparability of cohorts. Most of the included studies did
not control for potential confounders in design and
analysis.
Overall Response Rate

All studies provided data on the ORR for patients with
the KRAS p.G13D mutation versus patients with KRAS
codon 12 mutations and for patients with the KRAS
p.G13D mutation versus patients with wild-type KRAS.
In total, there were 1487 patients in the final analysis,
including 99 patients with the KRAS p.G13D mutation,
514 patients with KRAS codon 12 mutations, and 874

patients with wild-type KRAS. The association between
the KRAS p.G13D mutation and the ORR is analyzed in
Table 2.
Among patients who received cetuximab-based
treatment, patients with the KRAS p.G13D mutation had
a higher ORR than patients with KRAS codon 12 mutations (22% vs 16%; RR, 1.642; 95% CI, 1.131-2.384;
P ¼ .009) (Fig. 2), with no heterogeneity (I2 ¼ 0%)
between studies and with significant publication bias (t ¼
3.86; P ¼ .005). The trim-and-fill method was used to
adjust for publication bias, which would not have altered
our results.
Compared with patients who had wild-type KRAS
tumors, patients who had tumors with the p.G13D mutation had a lower ORR (23% vs 44%; RR, 0.540; 95% CI,
0.381-0.765; P ¼ .001) (Fig. 3), with no heterogeneity
(I2 ¼ 0%) and with no significant publication bias (t ¼
2.32; P ¼ .053).
Progression-Free Survival and Overall Survival

Information concerning KRAS p.G13D mutation status
and survival (PFS and OS) were reported in 3 studies
(Table 3).15-17 Only 1 study14 presented data on the HR
with 95% CI for PFS and OS. Therefore, the results could
not be reasonably combined in a meta-analysis. Among
the patients who received cetuximab-based treatment, 3
studies15-17 reported a longer median PFS and OS in
patients who had tumors with the p.G13D mutation than

Compared with patients who had KRAS wild-type
tumors, 3 studies15-17 reported a shorter median PFS and
OS in patients who had tumors with the KRAS p.G13D
mutation, but the results were not statistically significant.
De Rook et al15 reported a median PFS of 4.0 months versus 4.2 months (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.68-1.45; P ¼ .970)
and a median OS of 7.6 months versus 10.1 months (HR,
1.01; 95% CI, 0.66-1.54; P ¼ .980) for patients with
KRAS wild-type tumors and patients with the KRAS

The results from subgroup analyses of the ORR according
to treatment line and treatment regime are presented in
Table 2. A significantly higher ORR was observed among
718

patients who had the KRAS p.G13D mutation compared
with those who had KRAS codon 12 mutations in the subgroups that received cetuximab as second-line or subsequent
treatment (8% vs 2%; RR, 2.822; 95% CI, 1.078-7.388;
P ¼ .035) and combined cetuximab therapy (26% vs 19%;
RR, 1.610; 95% CI, 1.106-2.343; P ¼ .013), but not in
the subgroups that received cetuximab as first-line treatment (42% vs 30%; RR, 1.378; 95% CI, 0.927-2.048; P
¼ .113) or cetuximab monotherapy (0% vs 2%; RR,
2.637; 95% CI, 0.434-16.031; P ¼ .292). Compared with
patients who had wild-type KRAS tumors, patients with the
KRAS p.G13D mutation had a significantly lower ORR in
the subgroups that received cetuximab as second-line or
subsequent treatment (7% vs 31%; RR, 0.313; 95% CI,
0.140-0.700; P ¼ .005) and combined cetuximab therapy

Sensitivity Analyses

Sensitivity analyses were carried out by limiting the metaanalysis to studies that with sample sizes >29 patients,
studies in European counties, studies with high quality,
and studies that used the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors. All results were materially unaltered, and
no heterogeneity was observed, both of which suggest that
the results were statistically robust (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
The results from this systematic review suggest that
patients with mCRC who have tumors with the KRAS
p.G13D mutation may benefit more from cetuximab
treatment than patients who have tumors with KRAS
codon 12 mutations. First, our meta-analysis of 10 studies
indicated that patients with the p.G13D mutation who
received cetuximab had a significantly higher ORR than
patients with KRAS codon 12 mutations. In addition,
patients with the p.G13D mutation appeared to have longer PFS and OS than those with KRAS codon 12 mutations, although the available data were limited.
Second, among the patients who did not receive
cetuximab, patients who had tumors with the KRAS
Cancer

February 15, 2013

p.G13D mutation appeared to have worse ORR,17
PFS,15 and OS15 than patients who had tumors with
KRAS codon 12 mutations. There was significant interaction between KRAS mutation status (p.G13D mutation
vs codon 12 mutations) and cetuximab treatment status
with regard to ORR,17 PFS,15 and OS.15 Tejpar et al17
observed a significant interaction between KRAS mutation
status (p.G13D mutation vs codon 12 mutations) and
cetuximab treatment status (with vs without) with regard
to the ORR (P < .0001). De Roock et al15 reported a significant interaction between KRAS mutation status and
cetuximab treatment status with regard to PFS (P ¼ .050)
and OS (P ¼ .003). These results suggest that patients
with the p.G13D mutation may benefit more from cetuximab than those with KRAS codon 12 mutations.
Third, although our pooled results from 10 studies
indicated that patients who had tumors with the KRAS
p.G13D mutation who received cetuximab had a significantly lower ORR than those who had tumors with wild-type
KRAS, no significant difference between PFS or OS was
observed in any of the 3 studies that included survival data. In
addition, De Roock et al15 demonstrated that there was no
significant interaction between the KRAS p.G13D mutation

versus wild-type KRAS and cetuximab-based treatment versus
no cetuximab in terms of PFS (P ¼ .790) and OS (P ¼
.060). These results suggest that the survival benefits from
cetuximab may be comparable in both groups of patients.
Fourth, in vitro data15 demonstrated that cells from
tumors with the KRAS p.G12V mutation (an amino acid
substitution at position 12 in KRAS from a glycine to a valine) were insensitive to cetuximab, whereas cells from
tumors with the KRAS p.G13D mutation were nearly as responsive to cetuximab as wild-type cells. These results provide cell-based molecular evidence in support of our results
indicating that patients who have tumors with the KRAS
p.G13D mutation benefit from cetuximab treatment the
same as patients with wild-type KRAS tumors, whereas
patients who have KRAS codon 12 mutations do not.
Subgroup analyses of the ORR were performed
according to the line of treatment and the treatment regimen. One study17 in the first-line treatment setting with a
large sample size reported a higher ORR (40.5%, 30.5%,
and 57.3% in patients with the KRAS p.G13D mutation,
KRAS codon 12 mutations, and wild-type KRAS, respectively) than other studies, which resulted in a higher pooled
ORR for all patients and for the patients who received
cetuximab as first-line treatment. It is possible that patients
with early stage, chemotherapy-responsive disease may
720

respond better to cetuximab compared with patients who
are heavily pretreated and have chemorefractory disease. In
the patient subgroups that received cetuximab as first-line
treatment and cetuximab monotherapy, the difference in
the ORR between patients who had tumors with the
p.G13D mutation and tumors with codon 12 mutations
was not statistically significant, partially because of the
small sample size. However, the direction of the ORR was
the same as that for the subgroups of patients who received
cetuximab as second-line or higher treatment and patients
who received combined cetuximab therapy.
Our study has several strengths. First, we collected
individual data on the ORR from 7 studies6,13,14,18-21
that did not perform a comparison between patients with
the KRAS p.G13D mutation and KRAS codon 12 mutations, which significantly increased the statistical power of
the analysis. Second, except for 2 abstracts,16,17 all fulltext studies6,13-15,18-21 were of high quality, with an average NOS score of 7. Third, no heterogeneity was observed
in any comparison. This indicated that it may be appropriate to use an overall estimate of the association between
the KRAS p.G13D mutation and clinical outcomes after
cetuximab treatment.
Several limitations need to be taken into account
when interpreting our results. First, although all relevant

studies demonstrated a trend toward longer OS and PFS
in patients who had tumors with the KRAS p.G13D
mutation versus those who had tumors with KRAS codon
12 mutations, only 1 study provided HR data, which limited the quantitative synthesis of evidence. Thus, more
studies are needed to further clarify the relation between
the KRAS p.G13D mutation and survival. Second, the
number of Asian studies was relatively limited, and only 1
study was performed in Japan. Because ethnic differences
in response to cetuximab have been observed, more studies
conducted in Asian populations are needed to clarify the
ethnic differences in the relation between the KRAS
p.G13D mutation and clinical outcomes after cetuximab
treatment. Third, there was evidence of publication bias
with regard to the ORR of patients who had tumors with
the p.G13D mutation versus KRAS codon 12 mutations.
However, when we used the trim-and-fill method to
adjust for publication bias, the results were not altered,
indicating that our results were robust.
In conclusion, our systematic review demonstrates
that patients who have mCRC with the KRAS p.G13D
mutation appear to benefit more from cetuximab than
those who have KRAS codon 12 mutations and should be
treated differently. However, the number of studies and
the number of patients included in the meta-analysis were
relatively small. Large, randomized clinical trials will be
needed to further confirm these findings and to clarify
their clinical implications.
