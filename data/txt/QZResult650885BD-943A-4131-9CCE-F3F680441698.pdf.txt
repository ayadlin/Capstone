Abstract

Author Manuscript

Recurrent gene fusions, typically associated with hematological malignancies and rare bone and
soft tissue tumors1, have been recently described in common solid tumors2–9. Here we employ an
integrative analysis of high-throughput long and short read transcriptome sequencing of cancer
cells to discover novel gene fusions. As a proof of concept we successfully utilized integrative
transcriptome sequencing to “re-discover” the BCR-ABL1 10 gene fusion in a chronic
myelogenous leukemia cell line and the TMPRSS2-ERG 2,3 gene fusion in a prostate cancer cell
line and tissues. Additionally, we nominated, and experimentally validated, novel gene fusions
resulting in chimeric transcripts in cancer cell lines and tumors. Taken together, this study
establishes a robust pipeline for the discovery of novel gene chimeras using high throughput
sequencing, opening up an important class of cancer-related mutations for comprehensive
characterization.

Characterization of specific genomic aberrations in cancers has led to the identification of
several successful therapeutic targets, such as BCR-ABL1, PDGFR, ERBB2, and EGFR

the most prevalent category of ‘cancer genes’15. Typically, an aberrant juxtaposition of two
genes, may encode a fusion protein (e.g., BCR-ABL1), or the regulatory elements of one
gene may drive the aberrant expression of an oncogene (e.g., TMPRSS2-ERG). While gene
fusions have been widely described in rare hematological malignancies and sarcomas1, the
recent discovery of recurrent gene fusions in prostate2,4 and lung cancers5–9 points to their
role in common solid tumors as well. Considering their prevalence and common
characteristics across cancer types, gene fusions may be regarded as a distinct class of
‘mutations’, with a causal role in carcinogenesis, and being strictly confined to cancer cells,
they represent ideal diagnostic markers and rational therapeutic targets.

Author Manuscript

As a proof of concept we carried out whole transcriptome sequencing of the chronic
myelogenous leukemia cell line, K562, harboring the classical gene fusion, BCR-ABL1 16.
Using the Illumina Genome Analyzer, we generated 66.9 million reads of 36 nucleotides in
length and screened them for the presence of reads showing partial alignment to exon
boundaries from two different genes. While this approach was able to detect BCR-ABL1, it
was one among a set of 111 other chimeras (with at least 2 reads). Thus, in a de novo
discovery mode, it would be difficult to pin-point the BCR-ABL1 fusion in the background
of the other putative chimeras. However, when we used the known fusion junction of BCRABL1 (Genbank No. M30829) as the reference sequence, we detected 19 chimeric reads
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Thus, we considered an integrative approach for chimera detection,
utilizing short read sequencing technology for obtaining deep sequence data and long read
technology (Roche 454 sequencing platform) to provide reference sequences for mapping
candidate fusion genes.

Author Manuscript

An important concern in transcriptome sequencing was whether we could detect chimeric
transcripts in the background of highly abundant house-keeping genes (i.e., would cDNA
normalization be required). To address this, we compared sequences from normalized and
non-normalized cDNA libraries of the prostate cancer cell line VCaP, which harbors the
gene fusion TMPRSS2-ERG (Supplementary Table 1). Overall, the normalized library
showed an approximately 3.6-fold reduction in the total number of chimeras nominated.
Furthermore, while we expected the normalized library would enrich for the TMPRSS2-ERG
gene fusion, it failed to reveal any TMPRSS2-ERG chimeras suggesting that we would not
benefit from normalization in our analyses.

Author Manuscript

To assess the feasibility of using massively parallel transcriptome sequencing to identify
novel gene fusions, we generated non-normalized cDNA libraries from the prostate cancer
cell lines VCaP and LNCaP, and a benign immortalized prostate cell line RWPE. As a first
step, using the Roche 454 platform, we generated 551,912 VCaP, 244,984 LNCaP, and
826,624 RWPE transcriptome sequence reads, averaging 229.4 nucleotides. These were
categorized as completely aligning, partially aligning, or nonmapping to the human
reference database (Fig. 1a). Sequence reads that showed partial alignments to two genes
(Supplementary Methods) were nominated as first pass candidate chimeras. This yielded
428 VCaP, 247 LNCaP, and 83 RWPE candidates. Admittedly, many of these chimeric
sequences could be a result of trans-splicing17 or co-transcription of adjacent genes coupled
with intergenic splicing18, or simply, an artifact of the sequencing protocol. Surprisingly,

among the 428 VCaP candidates, only one read spanned the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion junction
using the long read sequencing platform (Supplementary Table 2).

Author Manuscript

Next, using the Illumina Genome Analyzer we obtained over 50 million short transcriptome
sequence reads from VCaP, LNCaP and RWPE cDNA libraries (Supplementary Table 3).
Focusing initially on VCaP cells, we identified the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion as one among 57
candidates, many of them likely false positives. To overcome the problem of false positives,
lack of depth in long reads, and difficulty in mapping partially aligning short reads, we
considered integrating the long and short read sequence data. Following this strategy we
found the single long read chimeric sequence spanning TMPRSS2-ERG junction from VCaP
transcriptome sequence, buttressed by 21 short reads (Fig. 1b), was one of only eight
chimeras nominated, overall. Thus, using the integrative approach the total number of false
candidates was reduced and the proportion of experimentally validated candidates increased
dramatically (Supplementary Fig. 2). Extending the integrative analysis to LNCaP and
RWPE sequences provided a total of fifteen chimeric transcripts, of which ten could be
experimentally confirmed (Supplementary Table 4). To ensure that the integration strategy
filtered out only false positives and not valid chimeras, we tested a panel of 16 long read
chimera candidates that were eliminated upon integration and found that none of them
confirmed a fusion transcript by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Author Manuscript

In order to systematically leverage the collective coverage provided by the two sequencing
platforms, and to prioritize the candidates, we formulated a scoring function obtained by
multiplying the number of chimeric reads derived from either method (Supplementary Table
4). Further, we categorized these chimeras as intra- or inter-chromosomal, based on their
location on the same or different chromosomes, respectively. The latter represent bona fide
gene fusions as do intra-chromosomal chimeras aligning to non-adjacent transcripts; intrachromosomal chimeras between neighboring genes are classified as (read-throughs).
Remarkably, TMPRSS2-ERG was our top ranking gene fusion sequence, second only to a
read-through chimera ZNF577-ZNF649.
In addition to TMPRSS2-ERG we identified several new gene fusions in VCaP. One such
fusion was between exon 1 of USP10, with exon 3 of ZDHHC7, both genes located on
chromosome 16, approximately 200 kb apart, in opposite orientation (Fig. 2a,
Supplementary Discussion). Furthermore, two separate fusions involving the gene HJURP
on chromosome 2 were identified. A fusion between exon 2 of EIF4E2 with exon 8 of
HJURP generated the fusion transcript EIF4E2-HJURP and a fusion between exon 9 of
HJURP with exon 25 of INPP4A yielded HJURP-INPP4A (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 4).

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, based on whole transcriptome sequencing, the highest ranked LNCaP gene
fusion was between exon 11 of MIPOL1 on chromosome 14 with the last exon of DGKB on
chromosome 7; confirmed by qRT-PCR and FISH (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 5). We
recently demonstrated that over-expression of ETV1, a member of the oncogenic ETS
transcription factor family, plays a role in tumor progression in LNCaP cells3. The
mechanism of ETV1 over-expression was attributed to a cryptic insertion of approximately
280 Kb encompassing the ETV1 gene into an intronic region of MIPOL1. Thus, while our
previous study suggested that ETV1 was rearranged without evidence of an ETV1 fusion

transcript, here we show the generation of a surrogate fusion of MIPOL1 to DGKB, which
appears to be indicative of an ETV1 chromosomal aberration.
In addition to gene fusions, we also identified several transcript chimeras between
neighboring genes, referred to as read-through events. Overall, the read-through events
appear to be more broadly expressed across both malignant and benign samples whereas the
gene fusions were cancer cell specific (Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary Discussion).

Next, we attempted to extend this methodology to tumor samples that represent the
malignant cells often admixed with benign epithelia, stromal, lymphocytic, and vascular
cells. Transcriptome sequencing of two TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion positive metastatic
prostate cancer tissues, VCaP-Met (from which the VCaP cell line is derived) and Met 3,
and one ERG negative metastatic prostate tissue, Met 4. Interestingly, in addition to the
TMPRSS2-ERG fusion sequences detected in both VCaP-Met and Met 3 tissues, three novel
gene fusions were identified (Supplementary Fig. 7a). One chimeric transcript from Met 3
involves exon 9 of STRN4 with exon 2 of GPSN2 (Supplementary Fig. 7b). GPSN2 belongs
to the steroid 5-alpha reductase family, the enzyme that converts testosterone to
dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the key hormone that mediates androgen response in prostate
tissues. DHT is known to be highly expressed in prostate cancer, and is a therapeutic
target19. DHT, like its synthetic analog R1881, has been shown to induce TMPRSS2-ERG
expression as well as PSA2. Additionally, we found exon 10 of RC3H2 fused to exon 20 of
RGS3 in the VCaP-Met (and VCaP cells) (Supplementary Fig. 7c). Another novel gene
fusion was between exon 1 of LMAN2 and exon 2 of AP3S1 (Supplementary Fig. 7d).

Interestingly, one read-through chimera, SLC45A3-ELK4, between the fourth exon of
SLC45A3 with exon 2 of ELK4, a member of the ETS transcription factor family, was
identified in metastatic prostate cancer, Met 4, and the LNCaP cell line suggesting
recurrence (Fig. 4a, upper panel). Taqman qRT-PCR assay for this fusion carried out in a
panel of cell lines revealed high level of expression in LNCaP cells and much lower levels
in other prostate cancer cell lines including 22Rv1, VCaP, and MDA-PCA-2B. Benign
prostate epithelial cells, PREC and RWPE and non-prostate cell lines including breast,
melanoma, lung, CML, and pancreatic cancer cell lines were negative for this fusion (Fig.
4a, middle panel). SLC45A3 has been earlier reported to be fused to ETV1 in a prostate
cancer sample3, and notably, it is a prostate specific, androgen responsive gene.
Interestingly, the fusion transcript SLC45A3-ELK4 was also found to be induced by the
synthetic androgen R1881 (Fig. 4a, middle panel, inset). Further, we interrogated a panel of
prostate tissues for this fusion, and found it expressed in seven out of twenty metastatic
prostate cancer tissues examined (Fig. 4a, lower panel). Interestingly, six of those seven
positive cases have been identified as negative for ETS genes ERG, ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5
in our previous work, based on a FISH screen20. One TMPRSS2-ETV1 positive metastatic
prostate cancer sample was also found to be positive for SLC45A3-ELK4 (similar to LNCaP,
which is also ETV1 positive3). Unlike the previous ETS gene fusions identified, SLC45A3ELK4 is a read-through event between adjacent genes and does not harbor detectable
alterations at the DNA level by FISH (Supplementary Figure 8), array CGH (data not
shown) or high-density SNP arrays (Supplementary Figure 9).As LNCaP and Met 4 harbor
genomic aberrations of ETV1, and express high levels of the SLC45A3-ELK4 chimeric

transcript, this suggests that ETV1 and ELK4 may cooperate to drive prostate carcinogenesis
in those tumors. To our knowledge, SLC45A3-ELK4 may represent the first description of a
recurrent RNA chimeric transcript specific to cancer that does not have a detectable DNA
aberration. Overall, SLC45A3-ELK4 appears to be the only recurrent chimeric transcript
identified in our transcriptome sequencing study, as other gene fusions tested in a panel of
prostate cancer samples, appear to be restricted to the sample in which they were identified
(at least in the limited number of samples we analyzed) and thus may represent rare or
private mutations (Supplementary Fig. 10).

Author Manuscript

Next we tested if the novel gene fusions identified in this study represent acquired somatic
mutations or simply, germline variations. Based on qPCR (Supplementary Fig. 11) and
FISH (Supplementary Fig. 12–Supplementary Fig. 13) assessment of a representative set of
fusion genes on patient matched germline tissues, we found the chimeras restricted to the
cancer tissues. Further, we interrogated the 29 genes involved in our gene fusions in the
Database of Genomic Variants (http://projects.tcag.ca/variation/) and found only 8 of them
with previously reported copy number variations (CNVs) (Supplementary Table 5), but our
matched aCGH data did not reveal any copy number variation in those genes
(Supplementary Table 6), suggesting that our samples did not harbor CNVs common to the
human population.

Author Manuscript

Based on the gene fusions we have characterized (Supplementary Table 7), we propose a
chimera classification system (Fig. 4b). Inter-chromosomal translocation (Class I) involves
fusion between two genes on different chromosomes (for example, BCR-ABL1). Interchromosomal complex rearrangements (Class II) where two genes from different
chromosomes fuse together while a third gene follows along and becomes activated
(MIPOL1-DGKB). Intra-chromosomal deletion (Class III) results when deletion of a
genomic region fuses the flanking genes (TMPRSS2-ERG). Intra-chromosomal complex
rearrangements (Class IV) involve a breakpoint in one gene fusing with multiple regions
(HJURP-EIF4E2, and INPP4-HJURP) and Read-through chimeras (Class V) include
chimeric transcripts between neighboring genes (ZNF649-ZNF577).

Author Manuscript

Overall, transcriptome sequencing was found to be a powerful tool for detecting gene
fusions, exemplified by our ability to detect multiple gene fusions in cancer cell lines and
tissues. One important limitation is in cases where the proximal partner contributes only the
regulatory sequence to the fusion and no transcript sequence (e.g, IgH-Myc in Burkitt’s
lymphoma). While it has been known that gene fusion events can play a causative role in
cancer, the current study has demonstrated that a particular cancer cell line or tissue can
harbor multiple gene fusions many of which are likely not recurrent. While it is unclear
whether these private gene fusions play a role in malignant transformation, they could
potentially cooperate with the driver mutation/gene fusions. Similar to the cataloging of
point mutations associated with cancer21–27, it will be important to catalog and investigate
the function of the multiple gene fusions present in a single cancer. The discovery of the
chimeric transcript SLC45A3-ELK4 underscores that a refinement of next generation
sequencing technologies and attendant analytical tools may well unravel the full scope of
these ‘dangerous liaisons’ in carcinogenesis.

instructions. 10nM library was used to prepare flowcells with approximately 30,000 clusters
per lane.
Sequence datasets
Human genome build 18 (hg18) was used as a reference genome. All UCSC and Refseq
transcripts were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu/)30.
Sequences of previously identified TMPRSS2-ERGa fusion transcript (Genbank accession:
DQ204772) and BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript (Genbank accession: M30829) were used for

Short read chimera discovery

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Short reads that do not completely align to the human genome, Refseq genes, mitochondrial,
ribosomal, or contaminant sequences are categorized as non-mapping. For many chimeras
we expect that there will be a larger portion mapping to a fusion partner (major alignment),
and smaller portion aligning to the second partner (minor alignment). Our approach is
therefore divided into two phases in which we focus on first identifying the major alignment
and then performing a more exhaustive approach for identifying the minor alignment. In the
first phase all non-mapping reads are aligned against all exons of Refseq genes using
Vmatch, a pattern matching program31. Only reads that have an alignment of 12 or more
nucleotides to an exon boundary are kept as potential chimeras. In the second phase, the
non-mapping portion of the remaining reads are then mapped to all possible exon boundaries
using a Perl script that utilizes regular expressions to detect alignments of as few as six
nucleotides. Only those short reads that show partial alignment to exon boundaries of two
separate genes are categorized as chimeras. It is possible to have a chimera that has 28
nucleotides aligning to gene x and 8 nucleotides that align to gene y and z because the 8-mer
does not provide enough sequence resolution to distinguish between gene y and gene z.
Therefore we would categorize this as two individual chimeras. If a sequence forms more
than five chimeras it is discarded because it is ambiguous. To minimize false positives, we
require that a predicted gene fusion event has at least two supporting chimeras.
Long and short read integrated chimera discovery

Author Manuscript

All 454 reads are aligned against the human Refseq collection using BLAT, a rapid
mRNA/DNA alignment tool32. Using a Perl script, the BLAT output files were parsed to
detect potential chimeric reads. A read is categorized as completely aligning if it shows
greater than 90% alignment to a known Refseq transcript. These are then discarded as they
almost completely align and therefore are not characteristic of a chimera. From the
remaining reads, we want to query for reads having partial alignment, with minimal overlap,
to two Refseq transcripts representing putative chimeras. To accomplish this, we iterate the
all possible BLAT alignments for a putative chimera, extracting only those partial
alignments that have no more than a six nucleotide, or two codon, overlap. This step reduces
false positive chimeras introduced by repetitive regions, large gene families, and conserved
domains. Additionally, while our approach tolerates overlap between the partial alignments,
it filters those having more than ten or more nucleotides between the partial alignments.

The short reads (36 nucleotides) generated from the Illumina platform are parsed by aligning
them against the Refseq database and the human genome using Eland, an alignment tool for
short reads. Reads that align completely or fail quality control are removed leaving only the
“non-mapping” reads; a rich source for chimeras. These non-mapping short reads are
subsequently aligned against all putative long read chimeras (obtained as described above)
using Vmatch31, a pattern matching program. A Perl script is used to parse the Vmatch
output to extract only those reads that span the fusion boundary by at least three nucleotides
on each side. Following this integration, the remaining putative chimeras are categorized as
inter- or intra-chromosomal chimeras based on whether the partial alignments are located on
different or the same chromosomes, respectively. Those intra-chromosomal chimeras that
have partial alignments to adjacent genes are believed to be the product of co-transcription
of adjacent genes coupled with intergenic splicing (CoTIS)18, alternatively known as readthroughs. The remaining intra-chromosomal and all inter-chromosomal chimeras are
considered candidate gene fusions.
One additional source of false positive chimeras could be an unknown transcript that is not
in Refseq. Due to its absence in the Refseq database, the corresponding long read would not
be able to show a complete alignment, but instead show partial hits. Subsequently, short
reads spanning this transcript would naturally validate the artificially produced fusion
boundary. Therefore, to remove these candidates, we aligned all of the chimeras against the
human genome using BLAT. If the long read had greater than 90% alignment to one
genomic location, it is considered a novel transcript rather than a chimeric read. The
remaining chimeras are given a score which is calculated by multiplying the long read
coverage spanning the fusion boundary against the short read coverage spanning the fusion
boundary.

Coverage analysis
Transcript coverage for every gene locus was calculated from the total number of passing
filter reads that mapped, via ELAND, to exons. The total count of these reads was multiplied
by the read length and divided by the longest transcript isoform of the gene as determined by
the sum of all exon lengths as defined in the UCSC knownGene table (Mar. 2006 assembly).
Nucleotide coverage was determined by enumerating the total reads, based on ELAND
mappings, at every nucleotide position within a non-redundant set of exons from all possible
UCSC transcript isoforms.
Array CGH analysis

Author Manuscript

Oligonucleotide comparative genomic hybridization is a high-resolution method to detect
unbalanced copy number changes at whole genome level. Competitive hybridization of
differentially labeled tumor and reference DNA to oligonucleotide printed in an array format
(Agilent Technologies, USA) and analysis of fluorescent intensity for each probe will detect
the copy number changes in the tumor sample relative to normal reference genome. We
identified genomic breakpoints at regions with a change in copy number level of at least one
copy (log ratio ± 0.5) for gains and losses involving more than one probe representing each
genomic interval as detected by the aberration detection method (ADM) in CGH analytics
algorithm.

the internal oligonucleotide, according to manufacturer’s instructions. PGK1 was used as
housekeeping control gene for UPL based Taqman assay (Roche), as per manufacturer’s
instructions. HMBS (Applied Biosystems, Taqman assay Hs00609297_m1) was used as
housekeeping gene control for Taqman assays according to standard protocols (Applied
Biosystems).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

Author Manuscript

FISH hybridizations were performed on VCaP, LNCaP, and FFPE tumor and normal tissues.
BAC clones were selected from UCSC genome browser. Following colony purification midi
prep DNA was prepared using QiagenTips-100 (Qiagen, USA). DNA was labeled by nick
translation labeling with biotin-16-dUTP and digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche, USA). Probe
DNA was precipitated and dissolved in hybridization mixture containing 50% formamide,
2XSSC, 10% dextran sulphate, and 1% Denhardts solution. About 200ng of labeled probes
was hybridized to normal human chromosomes to confirm the map position of each BAC
clone. FISH signals were obtained using anti digoxigenin-fluorescein and alexa fluor594
conjugate for green and red colors respectively. Fluorescence images were captured using a
high resolution CCD camera controlled by ISIS image processing software (Metasystems,
Germany).
Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0
1 µg each of genomic DNA samples was sent to Affymetrix service centers (Center for
Molecular Medicine, Grand Rapid, MI and Vanderbilt Affymetrix Genotyping Core,
Nashville, TN) for genomic level analysis of 15 samples on the Genome-Wide Human SNP
Array 6.0. Copy number analysis was conducted using the Affymetrix Genotyping Console
software and visualizations were generated by the Genotyping Console (GTC) browser.

Fig 1. Employing massively parallel sequencing to discover chimeric transcripts in cancer

a, Schema representing our approach to employ transcriptome sequencing to identify
chimeric transcripts. ‘Long read’ sequences compared with the reference database are
classified as ‘Mapping’, ‘Partially Aligned’, and ‘Non-Mapping’ reads. Partially aligning
reads are considered putative chimeras and are categorized as inter- or intra-chromosomal
chimeras. Integration with short read sequence data is utilized for short-listing candidate
chimeras and assessing the depth of coverage spanning the fusion junction. b, “Rediscovery” of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion on chromosome 21. Short reads (Illumina) are overlaid
