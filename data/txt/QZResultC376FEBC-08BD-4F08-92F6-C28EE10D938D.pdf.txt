Mammalian Target of Rapamycin–Dependent Acinar Cell
Neoplasia after Inactivation of Apc and Pten in the Mouse
Salivary Gland: Implications for Human Acinic Cell Carcinoma

Abstract
Cross-talk between the canonical Wnt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways
occurs at multiple levels in the cell and likely contributes to the oncogenic effects of these pathways in human
cancer. To gain more insight into the interplay between Wnt and mTOR signaling in salivary gland tumorigenesis, we developed a mouse model in which both pathways are constitutively activated by the conditional
inactivation of the Apc and Pten tumor suppressor genes. Loss of either Apc or Pten alone did not cause tumor
development. However, deletion of both genes resulted in the formation of salivary gland tumors with 100%
penetrance and short latency that showed a remarkable morphologic similarity to human acinic cell carcinoma. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice using the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin led to complete regression of
tumors, indicating that tumor growth was dependent on continued mTOR signaling. Importantly, we found
that human salivary gland acinic cell carcinomas also express markers of activated mTOR signaling. Together,
these results suggest that aberrant activation of mTOR signaling plays a pivotal role in acinar cell neoplasia of
the salivary gland. Because rapamycin analogues are approved for treating other types of human malignancies,
our findings suggest that rapamycin therapy should be evaluated for treating patients with salivary gland acinic cell carcinoma. Cancer Res; 70(22); 9143–52. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Malignant tumors of the salivary glands are rare, accounting for ∼5% of all head and neck malignancies and <0.5% of
all malignancies in the body (1). Although initially treatable
with surgery, the majority of patients eventually succumb to
their disease (2). In general, salivary gland neoplasms
respond poorly to chemotherapy, and hence, few treatment
options exist for metastatic disease (3). Very little is known
about the molecular alterations associated with the development and progression of salivary gland malignancies. A
major obstacle to identifying these events has been a lack
of preclinical animal models that could provide a basis
for understanding salivary gland neoplasia and for testing
therapies. Several murine salivary gland tumors have been
identified serendipitously in mouse models engineered

to generate mammary gland tumors (4–6). Because the mammary gland tumors were the focus of these studies, the
salivary gland tumors were often not fully characterized.
Developing mouse models that recapitulate human salivary
gland malignancies will be a critical step to increase our
understanding of these tumors and to discover targets for
therapeutic intervention to improve patient outcome.
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a protein
kinase that controls cell growth and proliferation in response
to multiple upstream factors including insulin, growth
factors [such as insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and
IGF-II], and mitogens (7, 8). Activated mTOR regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K)
and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E–binding protein 1 (4EBP1), both of which are crucial for cap-dependent
translation (9). Consequently, activation of mTOR signaling
leads to increased levels of many proteins required for cell
cycle progression, proliferation, angiogenesis, and survival
pathways. Not surprisingly, deregulation of mTOR signaling
is frequently associated with tumor initiation, growth, invasion, and metastasis (10, 11).
The lipid phosphatase Pten is one of several tumor suppressors that negatively regulate the mTOR pathway, and it
is now thought to be the second most commonly mutated
tumor suppressor in all human tumors, after p53 (12–14).
Because cancer cells often become dependent upon activated
mTOR signaling, this pathway is a promising target for therapeutic intervention (15). Rapamycin is a specific inhibitor of
mTOR signaling that binds directly to the mTOR complex

(mTORC1) and suppresses mTOR-mediated phosphorylation
of S6K and 4EBP1 (9). Rapamycin analogues (CCI-779,
RAD001, AP23575, AZD8055, and OSI-027) have been developed as anticancer drugs and are currently being tested in
clinical cancer trials [reviewed by Liu and colleagues (16)].
CCI-779 (temsirolimus) and RAD001 (everolimus) have
already been approved for the treatment of metastatic renal
cell carcinoma, and more applications are pending Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approval (17, 18).
As a central regulator of cell growth, the mTOR pathway
interacts with multiple signaling pathways (8, 9). One of
these is the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which
promotes proliferation by activating β-catenin–dependent
transcription and is itself often deregulated in human cancer
(19). In addition to activating transcription, Wnt signaling
augments the activity of mTOR, leading to increased phosphorylation of mTOR target proteins and cap-dependent
translation (20, 21). This previously unrecognized function
of Wnt signaling likely contributes significantly to the oncogenic effects of Wnt pathway mutations in human cancer. In
support of this concept, Fujishita and colleagues recently
showed that suppression of mTOR using a rapamycin analogue abrogated intestinal polyp formation in the ApcΔ716
mouse model of colorectal cancer (21). The APC tumor suppressor gene is a key negative regulator of Wnt signaling and
mutation of APC seems to be the initiating event in colorectal
cancer. Similarly, we contributed to work showing that rapamycin inhibits Wnt1-induced mammary tumor growth (20).
In this study, we show that conditional inactivation of Apc
and Pten in the mouse salivary gland causes a synergistic activation of canonical Wnt and mTOR signaling that depends
on β-catenin. Salivary gland tumors similar to human acinic
cell carcinoma (AcCC) quickly develop following mTOR and
β-catenin activation, with 100% penetrance, often bilaterally.
Although activation of both pathways is required for tumor
initiation in this model, tumors completely regressed following rapamycin therapy. Importantly, we show that activation
of the mTOR pathway is a common feature of human AcCC,
suggesting that this mouse model is useful for studying the
human disease. Furthermore, therapies targeting the mTOR
pathway may be effective for treating human AcCC.

done were approved in advance by the Van Andel Research
Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Tissue preparation and histopathology
All mice were examined at necropsy for gross organ abnormalities. Salivary gland tissue and tumors, as well as mammary glands, were collected, fixed in 10% (v/v) neutral buffered
formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer-thick
sections were cut from paraffin-embedded tissues and stained
with H&E. Histopathologic evaluation of murine tumors and
tissues was done by a pathologist with expertise in head and
neck cancer (A.K. El-Naggar). Sections of paraffin-embedded
human acinic cell carcinomas were obtained from the University of Michigan pathology department.
Immunohistochemical staining
Immunohistochemistry was done on formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue sections (5 μm thick) using the Discovery
XT System from Ventana Medical Systems according to
the manufacturer's instructions. The following primary antibodies were used at specified dilutions: rabbit polyclonal antibody to β-catenin (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology),
CD31 (1:50, Neomarkers), and cytokeratin 6 (1:100, Covance);
rabbit monoclonal to PTEN (1:20, Abcam), phospho-mTOR
(1:20, Cell Signaling Technology), and phospho-S6 (1:75, Cell Signaling Technology); rat monoclonal antibody to cytokeratin
8 (1:200, Troma1, Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa) and
Ki-67 (1:30, Dako).
Nuance quantification
Phospho-S6 levels in immunostained sections were quantified by spectral imagine using a Nuance camera system
(Cri). Emissions were collected between 420 and 720 nm in
20-nm increments. The resulting image cubes were converted to absorbance units and mathematically unmixed into
their individual components using spectra deduced from
control specimens and saved in a spectral library. The resulting component images were then analyzed using the Nuance
system's colocalization tool. This tool applies a standard
threshold to all images in an experimental set and is able
to evaluate nuclear or nonnuclear positivity. Values were
compared using Student's t test.

Materials and Methods
Transgenic mice
Apcflox/flox (B6/129), Ptenflox/flox (FVB/SLJ), β-cateninflox/flox
(FVB/SLJ), and MMTV-Cre (FVB) transgenic mice have previously been described in detail (22–25). Mice with different
genotypes of the Apc, Pten, β-catenin, and MMTV-Cre transgenes were generated by crossbreeding. The genotype of each
transgene was confirmed by PCR using tail biopsy DNA and
primer sequences (available upon request). Mice were monitored three times a week for tumor formation by visual inspection and/or palpation, and tumors were usually found when
they were ∼500 mm3. Tumor growth was measured three
times a week using a caliper, and all mice were euthanized before the tumors reached 2,000 mm3. An outline of the animal
work is shown in Supplementary Table S1. All experiments

Rapamycin treatment
Rapamycin (LC Laboratories) was given through i.p. injections at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Tumor size was
measured using a caliper daily for 28 days following the first
dose of rapamycin. Rapamycin was reconstituted in absolute
ethanol diluted in aqueous solution of 5.2% Tween-80 (U.S.
Biochemical) and 5.2% polyethylene glycol (Polyscience Inc.)
before injection. Control animals were given i.p. injections of
the aqueous solution of 5.2% Tween-80 and 5.2% polyethylene
glycol. The final volume of all injections was 100 μL.

were fixed and embedded in paraffin. BrdUrd-positive cells
were detected in tissue sections using an anti-BrdUrd mouse
monoclonal antibody (1:300, Sigma-Aldrich) and the ExtrAvidin peroxidase mouse staining kit (Sigma-Aldrich). A terminal
deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) assay for apoptosis was conducted on tissue
sections according to the manufacturer's protocol using the
DeadEnd colorimetric TUNEL kit (Promega).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
Single cells were isolated from murine salivary gland
tumors by mechanical disaggregation using Medimachine
(BD Biosciences). Cells were kept on ice and immediately
processed according to the manufacturer's protocol using
the Annexin V labeling kit (BD Biosciences). Cell sorting
and analysis were done by using the BD FACSCalibur Flow
Cytometer and Cellquest 5.2.1 software, respectively (BD
Biosciences).

Results
Salivary specific inactivation of Apc and Pten
Germline deletion of either Apc or Pten in mice results in
embryonic lethality. Mice heterozygous for the Pten gene
have a higher incidence of tumors in many organs, whereas
mice heterozygous for the Apc gene develop intestinal adenomas (26–30). To study the effects of Apc and Pten deficiency
in the salivary gland and to overcome the embryonic death

caused by conventional knockout strategies, we interbred homozygous Apc and Pten flox mice (Apcflox/floxPtenflox/flox) mice
with the MMTV-Cre transgenic mice developed by W. Muller
and colleagues (McGill University). On a FVB purebred
genetic background, this MMTV-Cre transgene is highly
expressed in the mammary epithelium (25, 31). However, in
a cross to Rosa26 (129 background), we found low penetrance (<10%) of MMTV-Cre expression in the mammary
epithelium, but very high expression in the salivary gland
(data not shown). Hence, on a mixed genetic background,
this MMTV-Cre transgene can be used to effectively delete
floxed alleles in the salivary gland. We confirmed that recombination occurred at the Apc and Pten locus in the salivary
gland of MMTV-Cre/Apcflox/flox/Ptenflox/flox (hereafter referred
to as Apc−/−Pten−/−) by allele-specific PCR (Fig. 1A). To determine the extent of recombination, we also carried out Pten
immunohistochemistry on salivary glands from 6-month-old
MMTV-Cre/Pten flox/flox (Pten −/− ) and MMTV-Cre/Pten +/+
(Pten+/+) mice. In Pten+/+ mice (n = 4), Pten was ubiquitously
expressed in all tissues from the three major salivary glands,
with prominent staining in the ducts (Fig. 1B). In Pten−/− salivary glands (n = 10), we observed a variable number of both
ductal and acinar cells that lacked Pten expression (Fig. 1B).
In 2 of 10 salivary glands analyzed, Pten expression was completely lost in cells from all three salivary glands, reflecting
highly efficient Cre recombinase activity (Fig. 1C). Pten
was ubiquitously expressed in the mammary epithelium
of Pten−/− female mice, and these mice exhibited normal

Taken together, these results show that the MMTV-Cre transgene was preferentially expressed in the salivary gland in our
model system.
Salivary gland tumor development in Apc−/−Pten−/−
and Apc+/−Pten−/− mice
Salivary gland tumors developed in the Apc−/−Pten−/− mice
(n = 25) with short latency and 100% penetrance (Fig. 2A).
Tumors were palpable as early as 6 weeks after birth, and
within 25 weeks, all animals developed at least one large tumor mass in the ventral neck region. Both female and male
mice developed tumors at a similar rate, with a median age
at tumor onset of 10 weeks. Necropsy revealed well-demarcated and encapsulated tumors that seemed to always involve the parotid gland (Fig. 2B). The tumors grew very

rapidly, with size doubling roughly every 5 days (Supplemen
tary Fig. S2A). Sixty percent of the mice developed two
or three tumors before being euthanized per guidelines
for the humane treatment of animals. In addition, 23% of
Apc+/−Pten−/− mice (n = 30) developed parotid gland tumors;
these tumors appeared within the same time frame of
25 weeks that Apc −/ − Pten −/− mice developed tumors.
Apc +/− Pten −/− mice that had not developed tumors by
25 weeks were resistant to tumor development later in life.
Once established, Apc+/−Pten−/− tumors grew as rapidly as
Apc−/−Pten−/− tumors. In contrast to Apc−/−Pten−/− mice, only
6% of Apc+/−Pten−/− mice developed more than one salivary
gland tumor. Mice that retained one copy of Pten were resistant to tumor development: none of the Apc−/−Pten+/− mice
(n = 26) developed tumors (Fig. 2A). In addition, none of
the Apc+/−Pten+/− or Apc+/+Pten+/+ control mice developed

tumors. None of the mice, regardless of genotype, developed
mammary gland tumors.
All tumors developing in Apc−/−Pten−/− and Apc+/−Pten−/−
mice showed marked morphologic resemblance to human
AcCC, with formation of acinar structures composed of cells
with abundant basophilic granular cytoplasm with and without squamous metaplasia (Fig. 2C). Both Apc−/−Pten−/− and
Apc+/−Pten−/− tumors showed nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for β-catenin (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S2B). All
tumors exhibited strong activation of the mTOR pathway
(shown by the large amounts of phosphorylated mTOR and
p-S6) and lacked detectable expression of Pten (Fig. 2D and
Supplementary Fig. S2B). Similar to human AcCC, immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin CK-8 was positive for
a significant fraction of tumor cells (Fig. 2D). In contrast to
human AcCC, 35% of murine tumors also contained areas of
CK-6–positive squamous metaplasia (Fig. 2D). The rapid tumor growth was evident from the large number of tumor
cells that expressed proliferation marker Ki-67 (Fig. 2D).
Synergy between β-catenin and mTOR activation in
tumor initiation
Because Apc−/−Pten−/− and Apc+/−Pten−/− (but not Apc−/−Pten+/−
mice) developed tumors, we established a Pten−/− mouse line
to test whether loss of Pten alone could induce acinic cell tumor-

igenesis. However, neither Pten−/− nor Pten+/− mice developed tumors within 78 weeks (n = 16 of each genotype), and histologic
evaluation of salivary gland tissue was devoid of neoplastic lesions. During necropsy, we noticed that the salivary glands of
Pten−/− mice were often enlarged relative to those of littermate
controls (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Histologic analysis showed
that loss of Pten was associated with an increase in cell size
and a corresponding increase in p-S6 levels (Fig. 3A and B). No
significant difference in the number of Ki-67–positive cells was
observed between Pten−/− or Pten+/+ salivary glands (Fig. 3C).
Hence, the salivary gland enlargement occurred without evidence of increased cell proliferation. Similarly, loss of Apc alone
was insufficient to induce tumorigenesis. In fact, we did not observe any histologic changes in the salivary glands of Apc−/− mice
(data not shown). In sharp contrast, loss of both Apc and Pten
resulted in rapid proliferation of cells with strong activation of
mTOR and Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Fig. 3D and Supplementary
Fig. S3B). Taken together, these results suggest that loss of Apc
and Pten synergistically activated Wnt/β-catenin and mTOR signaling to induce tumorigenesis.
Because APC has been implicated in regulating a number
of cellular functions (32), it was important to test whether
the observed Pten synergy was mediated through β-catenin.
Therefore, we established an Apc −/− Pten −/− β-catenin −/−
mouse line. None of these mice (n = 9) developed salivary

tumors within 52 weeks, implying that stabilization of βcatenin was indeed required for tumorigenesis. Similar to
Pten−/− mice, Apc−/−Pten−/−β-catenin−/− salivary gland cells
were enlarged and contained phosphorylated S6 (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Moreover, loss of one copy of β-catenin
(Apc−/−Pten−/−β-catenin+/−) was sufficient to inhibit tumor
formation in mice (n = 5) with this genotype for 52 weeks.
Tumor regression following rapamycin therapy
To determine if the salivary gland tumor growth in
Apc−/−Pten−/− and Apc+/−Pten−/− mice was dependent on activated mTOR and to provide a rationale for treatment of similar tumors in human patients, we treated tumor-bearing
mice with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Rapamycin directly binds and inhibits the mTORC1 complex. Low-dose rapamycin treatment was initiated on animals having tumors of
different sizes and was continued for 2 weeks. Tumor growth
was measured during rapamycin therapy and for at least an
additional 2 weeks. Intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg/kg
rapamycin effectively inhibited mTOR activity, as made evident by a loss in p-S6 4 hours after treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Nuclear accumulation of β-catenin was still
detectable in tumor cells following rapamycin therapy (Sup-

plementary Fig. S4B). Compared with the rapid salivary
tumor growth of untreated control animals (Fig. 4A),
rapamycin therapy dramatically inhibited tumor growth
(Fig. 4B). Apc−/−Pten−/− and Apc+/−Pten−/− tumor-bearing mice
responded similarly to rapamycin treatment (data not
shown). Analysis of cell proliferation on day 4 (after three
doses of rapamycin) showed that the number of tumor cells
with BrdUrd incorporation was reduced by at least 80% in
rapamycin-treated mice (P = 2.6 × 10−10; Fig. 4C). Importantly, rapamycin not only inhibited tumor growth but
also induced tumor regression (Fig. 4B). To determine if rapamycin induced tumor cell death, we analyzed tumor tissues and cells for evidence of necrosis and apoptosis. Flow
cytometric analysis of tumor cells on day 4 (after three doses)
showed that on average, 68% (SD 13.7%) of tumor cells from
rapamycin-treated mice were Annexin V–positive (Fig. 4D).
TUNEL assays similarly showed large numbers of apoptotic
cells following rapamycin treatment (Fig. 4D). These results
show that rapamycin quickly and effectively inhibited tumor
cell proliferation and induced cell death. The gene expression
profiles of Apc−/−Pten−/− tumors following rapamycin or vehicle therapy can be downloaded from the Gene Expression
Omnibus database (accession no. GSE23435).

Figure 4. Rapamycin inhibits tumor cell proliferation and induces cell death. A and B, cohorts of Apc−/−Pten−/− mice were treated daily for 14 d with
either vehicle alone or with rapamycin diluted in vehicle. Tumor size was measured three times per week using a caliper. The colored lines represent growth
curves of individual tumors. A, the tumors of vehicle-treated mice grew very rapidly. All vehicle-treated mice had to be sacrificed by day 14, following
humane treatment guidelines. B, tumor growth was effectively inhibited by rapamycin. Tumor regression was seen in all animals and continued after the last
dose of rapamycin. The dashed line indicates the 14 d of rapamycin therapy. C and D, a cohort of eight tumor-bearing Apc−/−Pten−/− mice were given only
three doses of vehicle (control) or rapamycin + vehicle (rapamycin). Twenty-two hours following the last dose, these mice were injected with BrdUrd
and sacrificed 2 h later. Salivary gland tumor tissues were collected and analyzed for signs of proliferation and apoptosis. C, proliferation was
measured by counting the number of cells with BrdUrd incorporation in each captured frame. Ten images at ×40 magnification were analyzed per sample.
Significantly fewer cells with BrdUrd incorporation were found in tumors of rapamycin-treated mice. D, single-cell suspensions were analyzed by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting using a FITC-conjugated antibody against Annexin V. Representative samples show that tumors of rapamycin-treated
mice contained significantly more Annexin V–positive cells than tumors of vehicle-treated mice (P = 5.2 × 10−3). Rapamycin therapy was also associated
with large numbers of cells that stained positively in the TUNEL assay for apoptosis; TUNEL-positive cells are brown.

liferating cells were detected in this tissue, indicating that the
malignancy had effectively been abolished by the rapamycin
therapy (Fig. 5B). The mTOR pathway is proangiogenic (33–
35), and we noticed that tumors collected from mice on day
15, after the completion of 14 doses of rapamycin, were pale
relative to tumors from vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 5C). To
determine the effect of rapamycin on angiogenesis in our
AcCC model, we counted microvessel number and size on
day 15 using the endothelial marker CD31. The microvessel
number and size were significantly decreased in tumors from
rapamycin-treated mice (P = 2.0 × 10−9; Fig. 5D). Taken together, these results show that rapamycin inhibited tumor
angiogenesis, which likely contributed to the complete
regression of tumors.
Evidence of activated mTOR signaling in human AcCC
To determine if the canonical Wnt and/or mTOR signaling
pathways are deregulated in human AcCC, we did immunohistochemistry for β-catenin and p-S6 on paraffin-embedded
tumor sections from 11 patients diagnosed at the University
of Michigan. Nuclear staining for β-catenin was only found in
1/11 tumor samples (Supplementary Fig. S5A). In contrast,
activated mTOR signaling was evident in all tumor samples:
the tumor tissues contained high levels of p-S6, whereas the
adjacent normal parotid gland tissues exhibited low levels
(Fig. 6A). The staining pattern of p-S6 correlated with an increased immunostaining for phosphorylated mTOR (Fig. 6A).
We quantified the level of p-S6 in tumor and adjacent normal
tissues using the Nuance spectral imaging system and found
a significant difference in all samples (P < 1 × 10−10, Student's
t test comparing p-S6–positive pixel numbers; Fig. 6B). We
also did immunohistochemistry for Pten but did not detect
a loss of Pten expression in any of the 11 human AcCC samples (Supplementary Fig. S5A).

Discussion

tumor section from a vehicle-treated control mouse is shown for
comparison. C, tumors of rapamycin-treated mice appeared pale relative

immunohistochemistry. Tumor tissues isolated on day 15 were stained

For 7/9 rapamycin-treated mice, tumor regression continued after the therapy was discontinued (Fig. 4B). Histologic
sectioning of salivary tissue on day 28, 2 weeks after the completion of rapamycin therapy, showed fibrotic tissue in place
of the regressed tumor (Fig. 5A). Very few Ki-67–positive pro-

In this report, we describe a novel mouse model for salivary gland tumorigenesis. This model is based on the inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes Apc and Pten using
floxed alleles of these genes together with MMTV-Cre transgene expression. To achieve targeted deletion of the floxed
Apc and Pten alleles, we used an MMTV-Cre mouse line in
which Cre recombinase is preferentially expressed in the salivary gland when the mice are kept on a mixed genetic background. Although Pten loss in other MMTV-Cre mouse strains
causes mammary gland hyperplasia and tumors (31, 36),
we observed infrequent loss of this gene in the mammary
epithelium of our mouse line. Instead, the expression of
the MMTV-Cre transgene caused the inactivation of the
Apc and Pten floxed alleles in cells of all three major salivary
glands, and 100% of female and male Apc−/− Pten−/− (MMTVCre/Apcflox/flox/Ptenflox/flox) mice developed salivary gland
tumors. This MMTV-Cre line should be very useful for the
development of further salivary tumor models, which has
been difficult until now because of strong Cre expression
in the mammary gland and the resulting mammary tumor
phenotypes.

Figure 6. mTOR pathway activation in human AcCC. Tissue sections from 11 human AcCC were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for p-S6 and p-mTOR.
Eight of 11 tissue samples contained adjacent normal parotid gland tissue that was used as an internal staining control. A, representative results for
AcCC samples 4, 6, and 7. Consecutive sections were stained with H&E to display the tumor histology. All AcCC-6 tumor cells and almost all AcCC-7 and
AcCC-4 tumor cells exhibited increased levels of p-S6 relative to adjacent normal gland tissue. As seen in sample AcCC-4, the increased level of
p-S6 corresponded to an increased level of p-mTOR. B, Nuance quantification of p-S6 immunostaining results. For every AcCC sample, 10 images were
acquired of tumor tissue and adjacent normal tissue. AcCC samples 9 to 11 lacked adjacent normal tissue. Graph shows the average percentage of
pixels with positive staining for p-S6.

The inactivation of Apc and Pten in the salivary gland led
to rapid development of tumors that manifested remarkable
resemblance to human AcCC. In humans, AcCC is a rare malignant neoplasm of the parotid gland (reviewed in refs. 37,
38), where its histogenesis, genetic characteristics, and biology remain undefined. The development of our model will
shed more light on AcCC development and progression
and allow for comparative analysis with other salivary carcinomas. As in humans, the murine tumors seemed almost exclusively in the parotid gland.
Tumor formation required inactivation of both Apc and
Pten because mice with inactivation of either gene alone
failed to develop salivary tumors. As expected, the murine
tumors exhibited strong activation of β-catenin/Wnt and

mTOR signaling. However, the Apc−/−Pten−/− salivary gland
tumors that developed were completely dependent on continuous mTOR signaling. Mice treated over 14 days with a
low dose of the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin (1 mg/kg)
showed pronounced and continued tumor regression. Even
after the discontinuation of rapamycin therapy, we found
only fibrotic tissue replacing the tumor and there was no
recurrence 14 days posttreatment. Interestingly, reports of
mouse acinic cell tumors developing in MMTV-v-Ha-ras,
MMTV-CD8-IGF1R and MMTV-HER2 transgenic mice have
been published (39–41). Because these growth factors can
activate mTOR signaling, mTOR may play a tumorigenic role
in salivary precursor cells leading to the development of
these tumors.

Preclinical Model for Acinic Cell Carcinoma

To validate our model, we screened 11 human AcCC tumors for evidence of Wnt or mTOR signaling and observed
that all tumors had significantly elevated mTOR signaling
(Fig. 6A and B). In several samples, strong p-S6 staining
was present in virtually all tumor cells suggesting that an
mTOR pathway mutation occurred at an early stage in tumorigenesis. We screened for the loss of Pten by immunohistochemistry but found no evidence for Pten inactivation in
any of the 11 tumors. Because mTOR activation can result
from mutations in multiple pathway components (8), highthroughput sequencing of human AcCC tumors to define
mutations in the mTOR pathway is an important future goal.
Although Wnt pathway activation was required for tumorigenesis in the mouse model, its role in human AcCC is not
clear. In mice, the tumor phenotype caused by mTOR and
Wnt pathway activation required β-catenin because the
Apc−/− Pten−/−β-catenin−/− mice failed to develop tumors.
Thus, tumor formation required β-catenin and was not a
consequence of other functions related to Apc loss. However,
only 1 of 11 human tumors we surveyed showed evidence of
β-catenin stabilization. One possible role for Apc inactivation
in the mouse model is to promote cell proliferation through
activating β-catenin–dependent transcription. It is also
possible that Apc inactivation increased the level of mTOR
signaling as occurs in mouse models for colorectal cancer
(21, 42). That all of the human AcCC tumors had activated
mTOR signaling but not Wnt signaling suggests that human
tumors activate other signaling pathway(s) that cooperate
with mTOR activation in AcCC pathogenesis.
It is worth noting that inactivation of Pten alone resulted
in salivary gland hypertrophy and hypercellularity without increased cell proliferation. This is consistent with the results

of several published mouse models in which inactivation of
Pten alone did not lead to tumor development (42–44), but
can cause cellular senescence (45, 46). Similar to our findings,
others have shown that Pten deletion in mouse brain caused
increased cell size but no effect on cell proliferation (47, 48).
It may be that terminally differentiated cells are refractory to
the growth-promoting effects of activated mTOR. However,
when Pten is inactivated in the presence of other tumorassociated mutations, for example, in p53 or Apc, this can
be highly tumorigenic (42–44). In summary, our study provides a relevant preclinical model for investigating therapies
for AcCC of the salivary gland. Furthermore, the data suggest
that rapamycin treatment might be useful for treating
patients with AcCC, which is important to evaluate because
limited treatment options exist beyond surgical excision of
the tumor.
