Abstract
The therapeutic benefit of tamoxifen in patients with
hormone-dependent breast cancer is limited by acquired
resistance to this drug. To investigate the biological alterations responsible for tamoxifen resistance, an in vitro model
was established. After 6-month continuous exposure to
tamoxifen (10 7 mol/L), growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells
was no longer inhibited by this antiestrogen. Although there
was no significant increase in the basal levels of activated
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), tamoxifen-resistant
(TAM-R) cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to epidermal
growth factor (EGF) and estradiol stimulated activation of
MAPK. Tamoxifen elicited rapid phosphorylation of MAPK,
in contrast to its antagonistic activity in control cells.
Blockade of the EGF receptor (EGFR)/MAPK pathway caused
more dramatic inhibition of growth of TAM-R cells than the
control cells. An increased amount of estrogen receptor A
(ERA) was coimmunoprecipitated with EGFR from TAM-R
cells although the total levels of these receptors were not
increased. Notably, ERA seemed to redistribute to extranuclear sites in TAM-R cells. Increased ERA immunoreactivity
in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane of TAM-R cells was
shown by fluorescent microscopy and by Western analysis of
isolated cellular fractions. In TAM-R cells, an increased
amount of c-Src was coprecipitated with EGFR or ERA.
Blockade of c-Src activity resulted in redistribution of ERA
back to the nucleus and in reduction of its interaction with
EGFR. Prolonged blockade of c-Src activity restored sensitivity
of TAM-R cells to tamoxifen. Our results suggest that enhanced
nongenomic function of ERA via cooperation with the EGFR
pathway is one of the mechanisms responsible for acquired
tamoxifen resistance. [Cancer Res 2007;67(3):1352–60]

Introduction
The antiestrogen tamoxifen has been used since the 1970s for
the treatment of breast cancer (1). Although f50% of patients
benefit from this therapy, almost all responsive tumors eventually
relapse due to the development of tamoxifen resistance (2).
Acquired resistance to tamoxifen is a serious therapeutic problem,
and major efforts are now being made to understand the
underlying mechanisms responsible (3).

Tamoxifen resistance can be subdivided into de novo and
acquired resistance, and the precise mechanisms responsible likely
differ. Augmentation of growth factor receptor function seems to
play a major role in de novo resistance. An inverse relationship
between expression of estrogen receptor a (ERa) and epidermal
growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) or c-erbB2 was observed in
primary breast cancer samples and was associated with decreased
sensitivity to endocrine therapy and a poorer prognosis (4, 5).
Engineered overexpression of EGFR and c-erbB2 in hormonedependent breast cancer cells promotes hormone-independent
growth (6, 7). A predominant role of growth factors as mitogens
may explain the de novo resistance to endocrine therapy.
The mechanisms for acquired tamoxifen resistance are more
complex. Usually, TAM-R tumors do not lose ERa, and the receptor
is apparently functioning because a portion of patients with
relapsing disease are responsive to secondary endocrine therapies
(8, 9). A body of clinical and experimental studies suggests that
modification of ER functionality by growth factor pathways might
be an important mechanism for acquired tamoxifen resistance
(10, 11). Cross talk between ER and EGFR family through
phosphorylation of ERa enhances its transcriptional activity
(12, 13). Increased recruitment of coactivators, such as AIB1
(SRC-3; ref. 14), and conformational change (15) after receptor
phosphorylation also contribute to enhanced transcription activity
of ERa in tamoxifen-resistant (TAM-R) breast cancer cells.
ERs classically act as ligand-dependent transcription factors in
the nucleus; however, recent data have identified a role for rapid
extranuclear signaling. The very rapid effects of estrogen on
calcium influx, generation of cyclic AMP, and stimulation of kinases
including mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (MAPK) represent key examples of the extranuclear events. Compelling evidence
indicates that activation of MAPK via extranuclear actions of
ERa requires participation of EGFR in certain cell types (16). The
potential link between ERa and EGFR is G-protein–dependent
activation of metalloproteinases that cleave free heparin-binding
EGF (HB-EGF) from surrounding protein complexes (16). Extranuclear ERa has been shown to be biologically important in cell
proliferation (17) and survival of breast cancer cells (18).
Recent data suggest that the nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of
ERa can be altered. Kumar et al. (19) reported that a truncated
MTA1 protein was highly expressed in aggressive breast cancer.
This protein sequesters ER in the cytoplasm and promotes
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAPK signaling. The
same group also found that overexpression of c-erbB2 caused
nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation of ERa (20). These data
suggest that cooperation of ERa with growth factor pathways
outside the nucleus might contribute to breast cancer progression
and resistance to endocrine therapy.
In the present studies, we hypothesize that augmented cooperation of ERa and EGFR contributes to the development of

ERa-EGFR Interaction and Tamoxifen Resistance

acquired tamoxifen resistance. We show that prolonged exposure
of hormone-sensitive MCF-7 breast cancer cells to tamoxifen
causes cytoplasmic translocation of ERa, which facilitates the
interaction of ERa with EGFRs. Enhanced interaction between
ERa and EGFR is associated with an increased ability of EGF,
estradiol (E2), and tamoxifen to stimulate MAPK. Taken together,
our result suggest that up-regulation of the extranuclear functions
of ER through cooperation with EGFR pathway represents one of
the mechanisms of tamoxifen resistance.

(Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA). Recombinant protein G agarose was from
Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA). Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were from Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). Cell culture medium, improved MEM (IMEM), was
from Biosource International, Inc. (Camarillo, CA). Fetal bovine serum
(FBS), glutamine, and trypsin were from Invitrogen Life Technologies
(Carlsbad, CA). Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin and Alexa Fluor 488 goat antirabbit IgG were bought from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All chemicals
were obtained from Sigma.
Cell culture. Wild-type MCF-7 cells (kindly provided by Dr. R.
Bruggemeier, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH) were grown in IMEM
containing 5% FBS. TAM-R cells derived from MCF-7 cells were
continuously cultured in the medium containing 10 7 mol/L tamoxifen.
The medium for matched control cells contained 0.1% ethanol.
Growth assay. Cells were plated in six-well plates at a density of 60,000
per well in their culture medium. Two days later, the cells were treated as
described in figure legends for 5 days with medium change on day 3. The
final concentration of vehicle (ethanol or DMSO) was 0.1%. At the end of
treatment, cells were rinsed twice with saline. Nuclei were prepared by
sequential addition of 1 mL HEPES-MgCl2 solution (0.01 mol/L HEPES and
1.5 mmol/L MgCl2) and 0.1 mL ZAP solution [0.13 mol/L ethylhexadecyldimethylammonium bromide in 3% glacial acetic acid (v/v)], and were
counted using a Coulter counter.
Tamoxifen, a partial agonist, exerts slight stimulatory effect on
proliferation of wild-type MCF-7 cells in phenol red–free medium
containing charcoal-stripped FBS (DCC-FBS); on the other hand, in the
medium with phenol red and 5% FBS, tamoxifen is inhibitory. Therefore,
the experiments examining the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen was carried
out in phenol red containing IMEM with 5% FBS. When testing agonistic
action of tamoxifen, cells were treated with tamoxifen or E2 for 5 days in
phenol red–free medium containing 1% DCC-FBS.
Immunoblotting. Cells grown in 60-mm dishes were washed with PBS,
incubated on ice for 5 min with 0.5 mL lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris
(pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L
sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mmol/L sodium PPi, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L
h-glycerophosphate, 1 Ag/mL leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)], pulse sonicated, and centrifuged
at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4jC. Cell lysates were stored at 80jC
until analysis. Total protein content of the lysate was determined by a

www.aacrjournals.org

standard Bradford assay using the reagent from Bio-Rad Laboratories
(Hercules, CA). Fifty micrograms of total protein were separated on 10%
SDS polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.
The membrane was probed with primary antibodies dissolved in TBS
containing 5% bovine serum albumin followed by incubation with
secondary antibody conjugated with HRP (1:2,000) and reaction with
SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology
Inc., Rockford, IL). Protein bands were visualized by exposing the
membrane to X-ray film and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics
(Piscataway, NJ) scanner and ImageQuant program.
Immunoprecipitation. Cells grown in 100-mm dishes were washed
with cold PBS and extracted with 1 mL lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 25 mmol/L NaF, 2 mmol/L NaVO4, 5%
glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin).
Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min, sonicated, and centrifuged at
14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4jC. Supernatants containing 1 mg total protein
were incubated with antibody against the target protein at 4jC for 4 h before
addition of 40 AL Protein G beads, and incubation was continued at 4jC
overnight. The protein G beads with immunocomplex were centrifuged at
14,000 rpm for 20 s. The supernatant was carefully removed. The beads were
washed twice with 1 mL buffer II (20 mmol/L MOPS, 2 mmol/L EGTA,
5 mmol/L EDTA, 25 mmol/L NaF, 40 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate,
10 mmol/L sodium PPi, 2 mmol/L NaVO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L
PMSF, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin) and then boiled in
50 AL of 2 Laemmli buffer. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis
in 7.5% to 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotting as described
above.
Immunofluorescent microscopy. Cells grown on sterile glass coverslips
in six-well plate were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room
temperature for 20 min. Cells were permeabilized in cold acetone at 20jC
for 2 to 4 min. After background blocking with 5% normal goat serum
in PBS for 1 h, the cells were incubated with the anti-ERa antibody
(H-184) overnight at 4jC followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor
488–labeled secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Alexa Fluor
546–labeled phalloidin were used for filamentous actin counterstaining.
The cells incubated with secondary antibody only served as the control
for antibody specificity. Confocal images were captured under Zeiss LSM
510 confocal Microscope using LSM Image Browser software (Zeiss,
Thornwood, NY).
Apoptosis ELISA assay. Apoptosis was measured using Cell Death
Detection ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) following the
manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, cells were plated into 12-well plates at
the density of 8  104 per well. Two days later, the cells were treated with
testing compounds for desired period of time. The cell lysate was prepared
by incubation of the cell monolayer with 0.5 mL lysis buffer at room
temperature for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min
at 4jC. A parallel set of plates with identical treatment was prepared for cell
counting. The result was expressed as absorbance at 405 nm normalized by
cell number.
Knockdown of EGFR with specific small interfering RNA. A smart
pool of double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) against EGFR and
nonspecific siRNA were obtained from Dharmacon Tech (Lafayette, CO) and
used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TAM-R cells cultured in
100-mm dishes were shifted to DMEM without antibiotics at least 1 day
before transfection. A 4-mL mixture of siRNA in Opti-MEM I (100 nmol/L)
and LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen Life Technologies) was incubated with
cells for 4 to 6 h and then replaced by culture medium with 5% FBS. The
cells were harvested 48 h after transfection.
Subcellular protein fractionation. Plasma membrane protein was
extracted using Mem-PER Eukaryotic Membrane Protein Extraction
Reagent kit, and nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted using
NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents kit following
the manufacturer’s instruction. The kits were purchased from Pierce
Biotechnology.
Statistical analysis. All reported values are the means F SE. Statistical
comparisons were determined with two-tailed Student’s t tests. Results
were considered statistically significant if the P value was <0.05.

Results
Long-term tamoxifen treatment alters the responsiveness of
MCF-7 cells to tamoxifen and E2. As shown in earlier studies,
medium supplemented with FBS contains sufficient estrogen and
growth factors to support growth of MCF-7 cells (21). Acute
exposure of wild-type MCF-7 cells to tamoxifen (10 7 mol/L) for
5 days in this medium causes 30% to 35% reduction in cell number.
Exposure of MCF-7 cells to 0.1% ethanol for up to 12 months did
not change the inhibition rate of tamoxifen (Fig. 1A). In contrast,
the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen was diminished in the cells
continuously exposed to tamoxifen over a period of 12 months
(Fig. 1B). As expected, E2 (10 10 mol/L) did not significantly
stimulate MCF-7 cells grown in medium containing phenol red and
5% FBS. Lack of stimulation reflected the fact that estrogen in the
serum and phenol red in the medium provided maximal
stimulation of growth, which masked the stimulatory effect of
estrogen (22). Exposure to ethanol over a 12-month period did
not alter these responses (Fig. 1C). Treatment with tamoxifen for
up to 6 months did not alter the pattern of response to E2. In
contrast, the rate of E2-induced growth stimulation was gradually
increased in the cells preexposed to tamoxifen for longer periods
of time (i.e., for 7–12 months; Fig. 1D). No growth stimulation
by tamoxifen was observed in long-term tamoxifen-treated cells
under estrogen-deprived conditions (data not shown). These
results indicate that long-term tamoxifen treatment enhanced
the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to the mitogenic effect of E2 (Fig. 1D),
while inducing tamoxifen resistance (Fig. 1B). The cells cultured in
tamoxifen-containing medium for longer than 6 months were
named TAM-R cells.

Figure 1. Altered acute responses of MCF-7 cells to tamoxifen and E2 after
long-term tamoxifen exposure. MCF-7 cells cultured for 0 to 12 mo with
10 7 mol/L tamoxifen or ethanol were plated in six-well plates at a density of
60,000 per well in IMEM containing 5% FBS. The cells were then treated with
tamoxifen (TAM ; 10 7 mol/L; A and B) or E2 (10 10 mol/L; C and D ) for 5 d,
and cell number was counted. For tamoxifen-preexposed cells, tamoxifen was
continuously present in the medium before the 5-d treatment with fresh medium
containing either tamoxifen or E2.

Basal phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAPK increases transiently during development of tamoxifen resistance. Activation
of growth factor receptors and their downstream kinase cascades is
an important mechanism involved in acquired resistance to
tamoxifen (23, 24). The MAPK and the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase pathways are the major cascades in mediation of
mitogenic signals in hormone-dependent breast cancer. To
monitor the basal levels of activation of these two signaling
pathways during tamoxifen treatment, MCF-7 cells continuously
cultured with tamoxifen (10 7 mol/L) in IMEM with phenol red
and 5% FBS were collected at various time points, and the levels of
phosphorylated MAPK and Akt were determined by Western
analyses. The levels of phosphorylated MAPK increased as early
as 5 days after treatment with tamoxifen and remained high for
2 months (Fig. 2A). There was no significant difference in the levels
of phosphorylated MAPK between tamoxifen-treated and ethanoltreated cells at 3 months (Fig. 2A) and thereafter (data not shown).
The levels of phosphorylated Akt during tamoxifen treatment
remained unchanged (Fig. 2A).
Enhanced responses to EGF and E2 stimulation of p44/42
MAPK in TAM-R cells. Although the basal levels of phosphorylated MAPK returned to the control levels after 3-month treatment
with tamoxifen, TAM-R cells were more sensitive to the stimulatory
effect of EGF. As shown in Fig. 2B, in TAM-R cells a significant
increase in the level of phosphorylated MAPK (1.9-fold) was
induced by EGF at the concentration of 0.1 ng/mL, whereas the
control cells did not respond to this concentration of EGF at all.
The responses increased with the concentration of EGF. At each
concentration, TAM-R cells displayed higher levels of phosphorylated MAPK than the control cells.
The rapid response to E2-stimulated activation of MAPK was also
increased in TAM-R cells. Compared with the control cells, TAM-R
cells showed earlier and more drastic increase in the level of
phosphorylated MAPK after E2 treatment (Fig. 2C). In TAM-R cells,
tamoxifen (10 7 mol/L) induced phosphorylation of MAPK at 3 to
15 min (Fig. 2D). Peak stimulation of MAPK (>5-fold) occurred at
3 to 5 min, which then decreased. In contrast, tamoxifen showed
slight inhibition or slight stimulation (data not shown) on MAPK
activation in matched control cells (Fig. 2D) depending on the
degree of deprivation of growth factors and estrogen in the
medium. The duration of tamoxifen-induced MAPK phosphorylation was similar to that induced by E2. These results indicate that
the nongenomic effect of estrogen increased in TAM-R cells. In
addition, tamoxifen acts as an agonist to elicit MAPK activation in
TAM-R cells.
TAM-R cells are dependent on EGFR/MAPK signaling
pathway for growth. Consistent with enhanced sensitivity to
EGF-stimulated MAPK activation, TAM-R cells became more
sensitive to the growth inhibition by small-molecule inhibitors
that block kinase activity of EGFR or MAP/ERK kinase (MEK).
The dose-response curve of TAM-R cells to AG1478 was shifted
to the left compared with that of control cells (Fig. 3A). The
estimated IC50 of AG1478 in TAM-R cells was f3-fold lower than
that in the control cells. AG1478-induced growth inhibition of
TAM-R cells was at least partially due to enhanced response of
these cells to the apoptotic effect of AG 1478. A significantly higher
portion of TAM-R cells underwent apoptosis than the control cells
when exposed to the same concentration of AG1478 (Fig. 3B).
Similarly, the specific MEK inhibitor, U0126, caused more growth
inhibition in TAM-R cells than in the control (Fig. 3C). These
results suggest that MCF-7 cells become more dependent on

the EGFR/MAPK pathway for growth after long-term exposure to
tamoxifen.
Enhanced interaction between EGFR and ERA in TAM-R
cells. The MAPK signaling pathway can be activated by the
members of the EGFR family as well as ERa via a nongenomic
mechanism. Increases in EGFR and/or c-erbB2 expression would
be expected to be responsible for enhanced sensitivity of these
cells to EGF stimulation because overexpression of EGFR and/or
c-erbB2 has been reported in de novo or acquired tamoxifen
resistance of breast cancer cells (4). To our surprise, expression
levels of EGFR, ERa (Fig. 4A), and c-erbB2 (data not shown) did
not change during the first 3 months of adaptation nor after 6 to
12 months (data not shown). Interestingly, in the cells treated with
tamoxifen for 4 months or longer, a significantly increased amount
of ERa was coimmunoprecipited with EGFR although there was no
change in the levels of these receptors compared with the control
cells that had been treated with ethanol (Fig. 4A). Knockdown of
EGFR with specific siRNA in TAM-R cells reduced the amount of

www.aacrjournals.org

ERa that interacted with EGFR as well as EGF-stimulated MAPK
phosphorylation (Fig. 4B).
We then examined whether the interaction between EGFR and
ERa could be blocked by a specific EGFR kinase inhibitor or by a
pure antiestrogen. Preincubation of TAM-R cells with the selective
inhibitor of EGFR AG1478 (5 Amol/L) for 1 h did not significantly
reduce the amount of ERa bound to EGFR (Fig. 4C), suggesting
that kinase activity of EGFR is not critical for its binding to ERa.
In control and TAM-R cells, treatment with the antiestrogen ICI
(10 8 mol/L) increased the amount of ERa coprecipitated with
EGFR at 30 min (data not shown) and 1 h and slightly decreased at
4 h of treatment (Fig. 4C). These results provided supportive
evidence that the cytoplasmic level of ERa is an important factor
determining its interaction with EGFR because it is known that
ICI compounds cause cytoplasmic translocation of ERa and
accelerate its degradation (25). Immunofluorescent microscopy
showed increased amount of ERa in the cytoplasm of both the
control and TAM-R cells treated with ICI (data not shown).

Long-term tamoxifen treatment results in nucleus to
cytoplasm redistribution of ERA in MCF-7 cells. Because the
levels of ERa and EGFR were not increased in TAM-R cells,
enhanced interaction between EGFR and ERa might result from
redistribution of ERa. To test this hypothesis, immunofluorescent
staining of ERa was carried out in TAM-R and control cells. As

the MEK inhibitor U0126 was evaluated under the same conditions as described

shown in Fig. 5A, the nuclei of the control cells were intensively
stained green, indicating that ERa was predominantly located in
the nucleus. Compared with ethanol-treated cells, TAM-R cells
were larger with more spread cytoplasm. Green fluorescence was
no longer restricted to the nucleus. Bright green spots were
scattered throughout the cytoplasm and on the cell borders. In the
experiment where the primary anti-ERa antibody was omitted,
there was no green staining at all, indicating that the green
fluorescence shown in Fig. 5A was specific staining of ERa (see
Supplementary Fig. S1).
To further confirm that long-term tamoxifen treatment
increased the pool of cytoplasmic ERa, fractions of the plasma
membrane, nucleus, and cytoplasm were prepared from TAM-R
and control cells. ERa level in each fraction was monitored by
Western blot. 5¶-Nucleotidase, GW182, and nuclear transport factor
2 were used as markers of plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and
nucleus, respectively. In the control cells, ERa was recovered from
both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions with higher levels in the
nucleus. In TAM-R cells, ERa was detectable in the membrane
fraction. The level of ERa in cytoplasm was increased, whereas the
level of nuclear ERa was reduced compared with the control cells
(Fig. 5B). These data, together with the immunofluorescent results,
indicate that long-term tamoxifen treatment caused redistribution
of ERa to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane and that this
facilitated interaction between EGFR and ERa.
Kinase active c-Src is involved in the interaction between
EGFR and ERA. A number of proteins have been reported to
serve as adaptor proteins participating in the nongenomic actions
of ERa. Preference for certain adaptors varies in different types of
cells. To determine whether enhanced interaction between EGFR
and ERa required an adaptor protein, several candidate proteins
were examined by immunoblots following immunoprecipitation
with antibodies against EGFR or ERa. We found that all adaptor
proteins examined, including c-Src, Shc, MNAR, and FAK, were
coimmunoprecipited by anti-EGFR or anti-ERa antibodies in
both TAM-R and control cells. Among those adaptor proteins,
only c-Src was found to be significantly increased to complex
with EFGR and ERa in TAM-R cells (Fig. 6A). Inhibition of c-Src
kinase with PP2 reduced the interaction of ERa with EGFR in
both TAM-R cells and control cells (Fig. 6B). The effect was more
dramatic in TAM-R cells. PP2 treatment promoted translocation
of ERa from the cytoplasm back to the nucleus. As shown in
Fig. 6C, green fluorescence (ERa staining) was concentrated in
the nuclei of TAM-R cells treated with PP2 for 48 h. Similarly,
the levels of ERa in the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions
were reduced and the level of nuclear ERa was increased by PP2
in TAM-R cells (Fig. 5B). More importantly, longer treatment of
TAM-R cells with PP2 completely restored their sensitivity to
tamoxifen (Fig. 6D). These results suggest that c-Src plays a
critical role in retaining ERa in the cytoplasm and facilitating
the formation of EGFR-ERa complexes during development of
tamoxifen resistance.

Discussion
This report shows that long-term exposure to tamoxifen resulted
in an increased association of ERa with the EGFR and in enhanced
sensitivity to EGF-stimulated MAPK activation. As a result, TAM-R
cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to the effects of the EGFR
inhibitor, AG1478, both with respect to proliferation and apoptosis.

Figure 4. Interaction between ERa and
EGFR was increased in TAM-R cells. A, cell
lysates were prepared from three different
passages (#1–#3 ) of TAM-R cells and
matched controls that had been exposed to
tamoxifen or ethanol for >4 mo. Interaction
between EGFR and ERa was examined by
immunoprecipitation (IP ) with antibody against
EGFR followed by immunoblotting (IB ) for
ERa. Numbers under ERa bands, fold
changes. B, TAM-R cells grown in 100-mm
dishes were transfected with EGFR siRNA or
nonspecific siRNA. Cell lysates were prepared
48 h after transfection for immunoprecipitation
and immunoblot. C, TAM-R and control cells
were cultured in serum-free medium for
24 h and then incubated with EGFR inhibitor
AG1478 (5 Amol/L, 1 h) or pure antiestrogen
ICI (10 8 mol/L, 1 and 4 h) before preparation
of cell lysates for immunoprecipitation.
The amount of total input protein for
immunoprecipitation is 1 mg.

immunoprecipitation studies, was associated with a redistribution
of ERa to extranuclear sites. A key finding to explain this
redistribution and its biological significance is that a c-Src inhibitor
prevented the translocation of ERa to the cytoplasm and reversed
tamoxifen resistance. Taken together, these findings provide new
insight into the process of enhanced extranuclear actions of E2,
which occur during the process of development of tamoxifen
resistance.
It is commonly accepted that activation of growth factor
receptor pathways, especially the EGFR family, is responsible for
both de novo and acquired tamoxifen resistance. Patients with
hormone-dependent breast cancer overexpressing EGFR and
c-erbB2 exhibit lower clinical response rates and/or shorter
duration of responses to antiestrogen therapy (24, 26). Inhibition
of c-erbB2 and MAPK restored the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen
on ERa transcriptional activity and cell growth in breast cancer
cells overexpressing c-erbB2 (27). Therefore, up-regulation of
transcriptional activity of ERa by growth factor pathways
has been considered a mechanism for development of resistance

to endocrine therapy in hormone-dependent breast cancer
(12, 14, 28).
Our results suggest that activation of the MAPK signaling via
cooperation between ERa and EGFR pathways is an important
mechanism for acquired tamoxifen resistance. The ERa and EGFR
pathways exert their biological functions through their own
receptors and via cross talk with each other. Activation of EGFR
increases ligand-independent and ligand-dependent transcriptional
activity of ERa. On the other hand, extranuclear ERs use the EGFR
pathway to induce rapid activation of MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which has been shown to be involved in estrogenstimulated proliferation and protection from apoptosis in breast
cancer cells (17, 18). Results from the current studies indicate that
the interaction of ERa with EGFR is augmented when the ER in
breast cancer cells is continuously exposed to tamoxifen. Enhanced
interaction between ERa and EGFR increases the sensitivity to E2
and EGF. Tamoxifen, under this circumstance, is no longer
inhibitory but stimulatory on MAPK activation. The up-regulated
system receives EGF, E2, and tamoxifen as stimulatory factors to

signal the MAPK cascade, which becomes a predominant
proliferation pathway in TAM-R cells.
It would be expected that enhanced interaction between EGFR
and ERa resulted from overexpression of EGFR, ERa, or both. To
our surprise, neither EGFR nor ERa was up-regulated in TAM-R
cells when determined by Western analysis. One significant change
after long-term tamoxifen exposure is translocation of ERa to the
cytoplasm. This phenomenon is due to tamoxifen treatment rather
than alteration in ERa expression because it does not occur in the
same cell line under estrogen-deprived condition (LTED). Elevation
in the levels of extranuclear ERa increases the opportunity to
associate with factors that facilitates activation of the MAPK
pathway via nongenomic mechanism. We did find that tamoxifen
treatment dramatically increased ERa levels in cytosol, as shown
by confocal microscopy and confirmed by Western blot analysis of
cell fractions. Additional evidence came from the results of ICI
treatment. The pure antiestrogens, ICI compounds, are also called
ER down-regulators because they cause translocation of ERa to
the cytoplasm, enhance the rate of degradation, and shorten ERa
half-life (29, 30). Dauvois et al. (25) reported that cytoplasmic
translocation of ERa was detectable within 15 min of ICI treatment
and continued to increase for 1 h. Consistent with these reports, we
observed an increase in the amount of ERa that interacted with
EGFR in both MCF-7 and TAM-R cells after 30 min and 1 h of
culture with ICI. The interaction was reduced by 4 h. These results
indicate that cytoplasmic translocation of ERa is required for
enhanced interaction between ERa and EGFR. Long-term tamoxifen treatment induces translocation of ERa from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm.
E2 elicits rapid activation of MAPK via extranuclear ERa in a
variety of cell types (31–34). Membrane localization of ERa usually
occurs via protein-protein interactions. Previous studies from our
laboratory showed that E2-induced rapid activation of MAPK in
MCF-7 cells required the interaction of ERa with insulin-like
growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor (IGF-IR) via the adapter protein
Shc (17, 35). This interaction brought ERa to the plasma membrane
and facilitated ERa-mediated rapid E2 action (17, 35). Other
proteins, such as c-Src, FAK, MNAR (36), and striatin (37), are also

reported to form complex with ERs and to be involved in
membrane localization of ERs. In TAM-R cells, an increased
amount of c-Src was recovered from the complex of EGFR and
ERa. The amount of other adaptor proteins coimmunoprecipited
with EGFR or ERa was unchanged or slightly reduced. These
data suggest that one role of kinase active c-Src in TAM-R cells is
to retain ERa in the cytoplasm. The precise molecular mechanism
to explain how relocalization of ERa occurs in TAM-R cells is
unclear at the present time. The fact that PP2 treatment reduced
the levels of cytoplasmic ERa implies that c-Src may also be
involved in a dynamic process of ERa translocation. Further
studies are needed to investigate in detail the mechanisms
mediating this process.
Several lines of evidence indicate the involvement of c-Src in
extranuclear signaling of ERa (38). c-Src activity can be activated
by estrogen in breast cancer cells. Mammary epithelial cells derived
from c-Src-null mice exhibit delayed MAPK activation in response
to exogenous E2 (39). ERa acts as a G protein coupled receptor
(40). The activation of the G proteins increases c-Src activity, which
leads to activation and secretion of matrix metalloproteinases
(MMP) MMP2 and MMP9. Activated MMPs cleave HB-EGF from
cell matrix, and released HB-EGF in turn activates EGFR (16). In
addition to ERa, GPR30 may also play a role in mediating
E2-induced rapid activation of c-Src (41). c-Src kinase can increase
EGFR activity by phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine residues 845
and 1,101. Overexpression of both EGFR and c-Src in murine
fibroblasts synergistically increased DNA synthesis and tumor
formation in nude mice (42, 43). These results suggest that c-Src
not only serves as an adaptor protein in the EGFR/ERa complex
but also acts in concert with these two signal molecules. Synergistic
interaction of EGFR, ERa, and c-Src enhances the responsiveness
of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to the mitogenic stimulation of EGF
and E2, which allows the cells to survive and proliferate in the
presence of tamoxifen.
We noted that TAM-R cells are extremely sensitive to EGF
stimulation. This could result from cross talk between growth
factor receptors and interactions of EGFR with a non–receptor
tyrosine kinase such as c-Src (43). A number of studies suggest that

ERa-EGFR Interaction and Tamoxifen Resistance

IGF-IR can signal to MAPK through EGFR in different cell
types, including breast cancer cells (44, 45). Knowlden et al. (46)
recently reported up-regulation of IGF-IR function and transactivation of EGFR by IGF-II in TAM-R breast cancer cells.
Interestingly, they found that c-Src was the link between these
two pathways. The current study could not rule out the
involvement of IGF-IR in tamoxifen resistance. However, the lack
of activation of Akt indicates that IGF-IR signaling is not the
predominant pathway in support of proliferation in this stage of
tamoxifen resistance.
Several endocrine-resistant breast cancer models have been
developed. Although up-regulation of growth factor receptor
signaling is a common feature, these models display variable
activation of kinase cascades. Constitutive MAPK activation was
also observed in our long-term estrogen-deprived MCF-7 cells
(LTED; ref. 47) and in the models reported by others (48). In
contrast to LTED cells, the levels of phosphorylated MAPK in
tamoxifen-treated MCF-7 cells increased transiently during the first
2 months and returned to the level of control cells. Another
controversial area is the expression of growth factor receptors. For
example, EGFR was reported to be 10-fold higher in one
antiestrogen-resistant model (49) but has no significant change
in the other (50). These differences may reflect the ways that breast

cancer cells adapt to different endocrine therapies (estrogen
deprivation or drug treatment) and may be related to the biological
characteristics of different cell lines. Our model suggests a novel
mechanism of tamoxifen resistance. Enhanced interaction of ERa,
EGFR, and c-Src facilitates the activation of the MAPK cascade
triggered by EGF or by E2 or tamoxifen via extranuclear function
of ERa (online Supplementary Fig. S2). Cooperation of the ERa
and EGFR pathways allows more efficient usage of the mitogenic
factors in the living environment and regrow in the presence of
tamoxifen. This model provides experimental evidence for
development of new therapeutic strategies to delay tamoxifen
resistance or to restore sensitivity to this drug in the cases that
resistance has developed.
