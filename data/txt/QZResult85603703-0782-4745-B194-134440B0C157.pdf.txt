ABSTRACT
Synthetic lethality (SL) has emerged as a promising approach to cancer therapy.
In contrast to the costly and labour-intensive genome-wide siRNA or CRISPR-based
human cell line screening approaches, computational approaches to prioritize potential
synthetic lethality pairs for further experimental validation represent an attractive
alternative. In this study, we propose an efficient and comprehensive in-silico pipeline
to rank novel SL gene pairs by mining vast amounts of accumulated tumor highthroughput sequencing data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), coupled with other
protein interaction networks and cell line information. Our pipeline integrates three
significant features, including mutation coverage in TCGA, driver mutation probability
and the quantified cancer network information centrality, into a ranking model for
SL gene pair identification, which is presented as the first learning-based method for
SL identification. As a result, 107 potential SL gene pairs were obtained from the top
10 results covering 11 cancers. Functional analysis of these genes indicated that
several promising pathways were identified, including the DNA repair related Fanconi
Anemia pathway and HIF-1 signaling pathway. In addition, 4 SL pairs, mTOR-TP53,
VEGFR2-TP53, EGFR-TP53, ATM-PRKCA, were validated using drug sensitivity
information in the cancer cell line databases CCLE or NCI60. Interestingly, significant
differences in the cell growth of mTOR siRNA or EGFR siRNA knock-down were detected
between cancer cells with wild type TP53 and mutant TP53. Our study indicates
that the pre-screening of potential SL gene pairs based on the large genomics data
repertoire of tumor tissues and cancer cell lines could substantially expedite the
identification of synthetic lethal gene pairs for cancer therapy.

Cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease with
numerous gene mutations involved. Some of these
genetic mutations serve as biomarkers in cancers. In
particular, notable advances have been made in cancer
therapy for example, with the discovery of Herceptin to
treat breast cancer patients with HER2 amplification, and
with Iressa for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer
patients with an EGFR mutation. However, developing
drugs that selectively kill cancer cells without harming
normal cells remains a big challenge in oncology therapy.
Given that genetic mutations underpin differences

INTRODUCTION
Synthetic lethality describes the genetic interaction
by which the combination of two separately non-lethal
mutations results in lethality. The phenomenon was first
described by Calvin Bridges in 1922 [1], who noticed that
some combinations of mutations in the model organism
Drosophila melanogaster confer lethality. Generally, the
ablation of two genes located in parallel pathways (leading
to cell survival or a common essential product) is one of
the important patterns causing synthetic lethality (SL) [2].

between cancer cells and healthy cells, Hartwell [3]
was the first to suggest the use of chemical and genetic
synthetic lethality screening for cancer therapy. Since
then, this approach has attracted great attention from
cancer biologists as it provides a promising perspective
for oncology medicine discovery [4, 5]. For example,
targeting the PARP-1 enzyme using Olaparib in ovarian
cancer patients carrying a tumor BRCA1/2 mutation
achieved milestone success in this area [6]. Ultimately,
siRNA and CRISPR screenings are the most reliable
methods for detecting SL gene pairs. However, compared
to model genetic systems (such as yeast or fruit flies),
human cell systems hold greater challenges for genomewide siRNA or CRISPR screening. For this reason,
several computational approaches have been proposed
to facilitate the systematic detection of SL gene pairs in
cancer. Briefly, these methods can be divided into three
categories according to their targeted data resources:
(i) inferring human ortholog gene pairs from yeast SL
genes [7]; (ii) using the robustness features to evaluate
the importance of gene pairs in the cancer PPI network
[8]; (iii) calculating mutual exclusivity using statistical
models from gene mutation/transcriptional expression
data [9–12]. More recently, Livnat et al. [13] proposed
DAISY to identify SL gene pairs. This approach combines
somatic copy number alteration, siRNA screening as
well as cell survival and gene co-expression information.
Derived from comprehensive in-house data, this approach
achieved a promising performance in data-driving SL gene
pair identification. Nevertheless, we comprehensively
compared the four available predicted SL data sets from
previously developed methods (including DAISY) [8,
10, 12, 13] on SL gene pair prediction. The concordance
of predicted SL gene pairs among those different
methods is extremely low (see details in Discussions).
This inconsistency across different methods may
indicate that the in silico SL gene pair identification
methods are far from mature. In addition, none of
the previous methods was learning-based, that is, SL
gene pair identification was based on the screening of
certain criteria rather than training and prediction. We
noticed that a portion of known SL gene pairs have been
accumulated, and the investigation of the characteristics
of these SL gene pairs are expected to derive significant
features which can quantitatively depict the common
mechanisms of the SL. Therefore, in our study, we
designed a learning-based pipeline to rank novel SL gene
pairs based on the known SL gene pairs, together with
other unknown ones. By mining the accumulated TCGA
mutation and gene expression data, as well as the gene
properties in the protein-protein interaction network, our
pipeline can be treated as an integration of the traditional
strategies, and ranked a list of potential SL gene pairs. In
contrast to the lack of experimental validation in most
previous methods, we implemented further siRNA knockdown experiments to evaluate our results.

Brief results of 10 times 5-fold cross validation
We evaluated the ranking performance in 11 cancers
through 10 times 5-fold cross validation, the other cancers
in TCGA failed due to the limited number of overlapping
samples between mutation data and the expression data
or limited coverage of positive SL pairs. The brief results
were listed in Table 1. Herein we didn’t intend to describe
the details of each pair, Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma
(KIRC) would be picked out as an example for illustration
(see details in Supplementary Table S1). Currently, TCGA
mutation data contains 417 KIRC patients. In addition, the
gene-expression data on 400 KIRC patients is available
in the TCGA dataset. At first, 528 genes with mutation
rate >= 1% were selected from the gene mutation data.
Following the workflow described in methods, 1014
candidate SL gene pairs were generated with the chisquare test p value <=0.05 and mutation exclusivity ≥0.8.
Three features (Gene pair mutation coverage, Driver
mutation probability, Network information centrality) were
subsequently calculated. The same calculation process
was used on the 119 positive SL gene pairs covered
by KIRC mutation and expression data and the cancer
network. During the 10 times 5-fold cross validation
procedure, the test set contained 23 or 24 SL pairs. Then
the top 25 results were used for NDCG calculation and
enrichment evaluation, respectively. alpha optimization
is a critical process in data manifolds ranking algorithm,
which can directly influence the ranking performance.
As it was shown in Figure 1, NDCG@25 was gradually
increased from 0 to 0.9768, as the increase of alpha; while
the enrichment p value was decreased. This means that
the ranking performance was better at a larger alpha.
Finally, the optimized alpha = 0.84 was achieved when
NDCG@25 reached the peak value. Then, after all of the
positive SL pairs were imported as the training set with the
optimized alpha, we generated a ranking list for the 1014
candidate pairs according to their relevance to positive
pairs. The same process was implemented on 10 other
cancer types. Finally, we generated a SL network in Figure
2, which is comprised of 107 predicted SL gene pairs from
the top 10 results in the 11 cancer types. (See all of the
ranking results in Supplementary Table S2)

Function analysis of the genes in the predicted
novel SL pairs
Pathway enrichment was utilized to decipher
the biological functions of the gene list. Specifically,
73/107 genes were mapped to KEGG pathways. From
Table 2, we can see that these genes are mainly enriched
in 15 pathways (covering 61.64% of the mapped genes)
involved in six biological process categories, namely,
replication and repair, signal transduction, the endocrine

system, cell growth and death, cellular immunity and
development. In particular, the Fanconi Anemia pathway
ranked No.1 as a potential pathway for identifying
novel anticancer therapies by exploiting synthetic lethal
relationships [14]. The most famous example of this is the
synthetic lethality relationship between the BRCA1/2 gene
in the Fanconi Anemia pathways and PARP [15]. Recently,
the first-in-class PARP inhibitor, Olaparib, was approved
by the U.S. FDA for use in advanced ovarian cancer

patients with BRCA mutations [16]. Based on our findings,
several other biological pathways for synthetic lethality
exploration were identified. For example, the HIF-1
signalling pathway (which activates the transcription of
genes involved in angiogenesis, cell survival, glucose
metabolism and invasion), was used as a screening
resource in discovering synthetic lethal gene pairs [17].
RAS signalling [18], P53 signalling [19], PI3K-AKT
signalling [20], are also widely considered to be promising

previously attracted considerable research interest.

and their roles are essential (type A), subunits of an
essential multi-protein complex (type B), interconnected
components in an essential linear pathway (type C), or
they may participate in parallel pathways that are together
essential (type D). The 4 pairs were consistent with either
type D or type C.

In-vitro drug sensitivity of cell lines in which one
of the genes in each synthetic lethality pair is
targeted
In the process of validating the SL gene pairs in the
cell lines, two strict criteria are applied in the cell response
information for each SL gene pair: 1. One of the genes in
a SL pair should be the target of a drug in the database. 2.
Several cancer cell lines treated by the drug must possess
the mutation of the other gene in the SL pair. Finally, only
37 predicted SL gene pairs could be well annotated by
the drug sensitivity data in CCLE [21] and NCI60 [22]
databases (see Table 3 and Table 4). We compared the drug
sensitivity of the two types of cancer cell lines, namely,
the cell lines with the other gene mutation and the cell
lines without the other gene mutation in the SL pair. We
found 4 pairs: mTOR-TP53, VEGFR2-TP53, EGFRTP53, ATM-PRKCA which showed significantly higher
drug sensitivity (targeting one of the genes in the SL pairs)
in the cell lines with the other gene mutations (P value <=
0.05), than the cell lines without the other gene mutation
in these predicted SL pairs.

mTOR-TP53
mTOR can integrate nutrient and mitogen signals to
activate cell growth (increase cell mass and cell size) and
cell division [24, 25], whilst one of the most important
functions of TP53 is its ability to activate apoptosis [26].
Cell growth and apoptosis may provide parallel functions
in cancer pathology. mTOR and TP53 may be considered
synthetic lethality targets.

VEGFR2-TP53, EGFR-TP53
EGFR is a hot target for cancer therapy with many
currently FDA approved drugs, and can activate at least
4 major downstream signalling cascades including; RASRAF-MEK-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, PLCgamma-PKC and
STATs modules. Those signalling cascades can ultimately
lead to a series of cellular events such as cell proliferation,
inhibition of apoptosis, angiogenesis, migration, adhesion
and invasion [27]. Furthermore, VEGF’s can specifically
induce blood and lymphatic vessel development and
homeostasis [28]. Inhibition of EGFR can block the
angiogenesis process. Double knock out VEGFR2 and
TP53 may lead to synthetic lethality through angiogenesis
and apoptosis.

Possible molecular mechanisms of the 4 positive
pairs
According to Kaelin [23]’s synthetic lethality model,
synthetic lethality occurs via 4 different mechanisms: The
cellular organizational units may be uniquely redundant

Hence, ATM and PRKCA knock-out, coupled with loss of
function of apoptosis and the cell migration process, may
generate synthetic lethality.

ATM [29] is a key regulator of multiple signaling
cascades that respond to DNA damage. These responses
involve the activation of cell cycle checkpoint factors,
DNA repair and apoptosis. PRKCA has long been
recognized to participate in activating tumour growth and
development across different cancers [30]. In addition,
PRKCA activation can result in increased cell motility in
several in vivo and in vitro cancer models, the effect of
which may be reversed with PRKCA inhibition [31, 32].

was achieved after 96 hours of mTOR knockdown in the
MCF7 cells. This may indicate that wild type TP53 in the
MCF7 line can possibly strongly enhance the cell growth
inhibition effects of mTOR knock-down, compared to the
mutant TP53 in FaDu.

siRNA knock-down validation on TP53-EGFR
Also, no significant difference in the EGFR siRNA
knock-down rate was detected between MCF7 and FaDu.
The optimal knock-down rates were 82.81% and 88.87%
in FaDu and MCF7, respectively. Figure 3B displays the
relative cell growth of MCF7 and FaDu cells after EGFR
siRNA knock-down within 96 hours. No inhibition of cell
growth using EGFR knock-down was observed in FaDu
cells. The average relative cell growth was maintained at
around 0.9325 ~ 1.0300 upon EGFR knock-down, whilst
the relative cell growth of MCF7 strongly decreased from
0.9595 to 0.6884 following EGFR knock-down. 24 hours
after EGFR knock-down, the relative cell growth of the
MCF7 line was always significantly lower than the FaDu
line with a t-test P value of less than 0.01. The wild type
TP53 in MCF7 cells with EGFR knock-down could lead
to cell growth inhibition.

siRNA knock-down validation on TP53-mTOR
According to the results of mRNA expression
detection, there was no significant difference in the mTOR
knock-down rate between MCF7 and FaDu (average mTOR
knock-down rate: MCF7 62.26%; FaDu 60.67%). As shown
in Figure 3A, the cell growth inhibitory effect of mTOR
knock-down was observed in both MCF7 and FaDu. 96
hours after mTOR siRNA knock-down, the relative cell
growth of FaDu slightly decreased from 1.1596 to 0.8178,
while the relative cell growth of MCF7 dramatically
decreased from 0.9509 to 0.4581. 24 hours after mTOR
knock-down, the relative cell growth of MCF7 was always
significantly lower than FaDu with a t-test P value of less
than 0.01. The lowest inhibition of cell growth (54.19%)

slightly from 1.030 to 0.9208. Considering the high ATM
siRNA knock-down efficiency, this suggests that ATM
knock-down has very limited inhibition effects on MCF cell
growth. For SW48 cells, the relative cell growth decreased
from 0.9936 to 0.8495. 96 hours after ATM knock-down,
the relative cell growth of SW48 was significantly lower

P value = 0.01296). This may partly indicate that the mutant
PRKCA in SW48 cells can enhance the inhibition of cell
growth on ATM knock-down, compared to the wild type
PRKCA in MCF7. The slight inhibition observed on SW48
cell growth may be caused by the low ATM siRNA knockdown rate in the cell. It may be a novel SL gene pair with
further rigorous validation.

siRNA knock-down is limited by both the
expression level of the gene in the cell and the knockdown efficiency of the siRNA. In our study, we failed to
validate VEGFR2-TP53 due to the low expression levels
of VEGFR2 in the FaDu cell line. The low knock-down
rate (45%) of ATM may weaken the inhibitory effects on
cell growth. In response to these issues, the latest CRISPR
technology [38, 39], which can provide considerable gene
editing power, may provide a more reliable approach to
further validate SL gene pairs.
Detecting SL gene pairs in humans is a challenging
problem due to the highly evolved, complex and redundant
signalling pathways within human cells. The influence of
a loss of function caused by gene mutation can often be
complemented by parallel pathway signalling. Various
computational methods can provide potential SL gene
pairs from different perspectives, such as the correlation
of gene expression with mutation, robustness in the cancer
network or gene co-expression in related biological
processes. In this study, we compared the 107 predicted SL
pairs with the results of four previous methods (see details
in Supplementary Table S3). As shown in Figure 4, 12.15%
(13 pairs) of our predicted results overlapped with Wang’s
[10] or Kranthi’s [8] prediction. Importantly, TP53-mTOR
and EGFR-TP53 pairs validated by drug sensitivity data
were included in the overlapping pairs. This may suggest
that overlapping predictions from different methods may
provide more reliable results. Interestingly, we also found

DISCUSSION
Regarding the predicted SL gene pairs: mTOR-TP53
and EGFR-TP53, we found that mTOR knock-down or
EGFR knock-down could cause much stronger cell growth
inhibition in cell lines with wild type TP53, compared
to mutant TP53. It seems that the relationships between
mTOR-TP53 and EGFR-TP53 are exactly opposed to the
concept of synthetic lethality. Indeed, the multifunctional
nature of mutant TP53 needs to be better understood. A
series of earlier studies [34–37] had suggested that mutant
TP53 not only represents the equivalent of wild type TP53
functional loss, but also acquires new functions in driving
cell migration, invasion and metastasis. The significant
differences in cell growth between cancer cell lines with
wild type TP53 and mutant TP53 could partly suggest
that there is a special relationship between TP53-mTOR
and TP53-EGFR. Notably, TP53 may be a promising
biomarker in the development of cancer drugs targeting
the mTOR and EGFR pathways in precision medicine.

gene pairs. Then the semi-supervised method could rank
the candidate SL gene pairs according to the similarity of
these features with the known SL gene pairs. Herein, gene
pair mutation coverage was defined as the percentage of
samples containing at least one gene mutation in the pair.
Furthermore, in order to get more reliable results from
TCGA mutation data, the mutations of genes in candidate
SL pairs should be covered by a certain number of samples.
Driver mutations play vital roles in cancer development.
Regarding the cancer specific SL pairs, we hypothesised
that the mutation of genes playing an important role in
cancer progression are more likely to be driver mutations.
Last, the network information centrality helps to identify the
potential nodes, which are crucial for the proper functioning
of the system. Since simultaneously mutating two genes in
a SL gene pair could dramatically influence the cellular
process and cause cell death, network information centrality
was used to calculate the influence of knocking-out a node
pair on system stability. This approach inherently mimics
the synthetic lethality mechanism well.
The brief workflow of the SL prediction pipeline is
shown in Figure 5. In the first step, cancer biomarkers were
collected from COSMIC [43] and MetaCore [44], which
were used as a filter to select raw cancer related SL pairs.
Next, the positive SL pairs were generated from yeast SL
pairs, followed by homolog gene transformation, cancer
biomarker filtering as well as the application of evidence
in human cell lines obtained from literature mining. The
candidate genes were selected from TCGA mutation data.
The raw candidate SL pairs were then composed based
on a candidate gene and a gene within a cancer network.
Then, a Chi-square test (implemented by chi2_contingency
in python package Scipy) was used to evaluate whether
the mutations of the two genes is an independent event
in each raw candidate SL pair. In addition, the mutation
exclusivity was also calculated, which was defined as the
percentage of samples carrying one of the mutant genes
in the SL gene pair [9]. Only those independent gene
mutations with high mutation exclusivity were selected as
candidate SL pairs for further calculation. Subsequently,
three features of both candidate SL pairs and positive
SL pairs were calculated and normalized before being
exported into a learning model. Finally, the novel SL pairs
were detected with an optimized parameter which was
obtained from 10 times 5-fold cross validation.

that no overlap occurred between Livnat’s [13] predictions
or any of the other four methods. The original input data
may be one of the important factors in influencing the final
predictions. Kranthi’s method [8] started with the human
protein-protein interaction database HPRD [40] as well as
CancerGenes [22]. Wang’s prediction [10] was based on
the profiling data of glioblastoma multiforme from TCGA
as well as the p53 mutation information from the Trust
Sanger Institute. Srihari [12] used the copy-number and
gene-expression profiling data of four cancers (breast,
prostate, ovarian and uterine) in TCGA as input data for
their method. The different features of these input data
across the methods may generate bias in SL gene pair
predictions. Since there was no priori knowledge of
cancer targets in the NCI-60 database, CancerGenes or
Metacore were used to filter the input data in Livnat’s
model [13], the potential SL gene pairs from the cancer
lines may lead to distinct prediction results from others.
In addition, due to the low concordance of results between
different methods, further efforts to explore such complex
SL relationships in a human system may be required.

CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we proposed a semi-supervised ranking
pipeline to rank novel SL gene pairs based on the vast
amounts of accumulated TCGA data. 107 novel potential
SL gene pairs were predicted from the top 10 results
covering 11 cancers. In particular, 4 SL pairs: mTORTP53, VEGFR2-TP53, EGFR-TP53, ATM-PRKCA, could
be validated using drug sensitivity information in the
cancer cell line databases CCLE or NCI60. Furthermore,
the results of siRNA knock-down experiments indicated
that significant differences in the cell growth of mTOR
or EGFR siRNA knock-down were detected between
the cancer cells with wild type TP53 and mutant TP53.
The TP53 mutation may serve as a biomarker for cancer
therapy in drugs targeting mTOR or EGFR. More
promisingly, a recent study [41] has proposed P53 as a
biomarker for predicting the progression free survival
(PFS) of pancreatic cancer patients being treated with
erlotinib (EGFR inhibitor). Taken together, these data
underscore the potential of investigating the role of P53 as
a predictive biomarker in other cancer types.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

TCGA mutation and expression data processing

SL gene pair prediction pipeline

We downloaded TCGA mutation and expression
profiling data from the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser
(https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu), which provides wellannotated and interactive visualizations of TCGA genomic,
phenotypic, and clinical data [45]. We then obtained two
matrices. Each row of the matrices represented a gene,
and each column indicated a sample. The values in the
cells represented the expression and mutation status in

In this study, we designed a semi-supervised learning
model [42] to rank the similarities between positive SL gene
pairs and candidate SL gene pairs, mainly using 3 defined
features namely, gene pair mutation coverage, driver
mutation probability and the quantified network information
centrality. More specifically, we used three features to
describe both the known SL gene pairs and candidate SL

Figure 5: Workflow of the SL prediction pipeline. The three types of original data (gene mutation and expression, cancer biomarker,

SL-pairs in yeast) were downloaded from TCGA, COSMIC and MetaCore as well as BIOGRID, respectively. The cancer network was built
from the interaction of cancer biomarkers in the protein-protein interaction database HPRD. Each raw candidate SL pair was composed
of a highly mutated gene and another gene in the cancer network. Then a chi-square test on the mutation exclusivity with p value <= 0.05
was utilized to generate the candidate SL pairs, while the positive SL pairs were derived from the yeasts’ SL pairs followed by homology
transformation, cancer biomarker filtration and literature evidence identification on human cell lines. For each pair in of candidate SL and
positive SL data, three features were generated for them. The first feature was calculated from the mutation coverage of each SL gene pair in
the TCGA mutation data. The driver mutation probability was calculated by R package DriverNet. The third feature was defined to evaluate
the influence on stability of the cancer network, after removing the two genes from an SL pair. Then normalized features of each SL pair
were imported into a manifolds ranking model to generate a ranking list of potential SL pairs.

homolog human SL gene pairs with both of the genes
covered by cancer biomarkers or driver genes were kept
for downstream analysis. In order to reduce the false
positive rate as much as possible, for each homolog
human SL gene pair, we checked the evidence available
in the PubMed literature. Finally, 399 positive SL pairs
were identified with the evidence of synthetic lethality in
human cell lines or animal models in the literature (see
Supplementary Table S4).

the gene expression matrix and the gene mutation matrix,
respectively. Finally, data from 11 cancers, containing both
the gene expression matrix and the corresponding gene
mutation matrix, were used in our study.

Positive synthetic lethality gene pairs
The collective data on yeast SL (synthetic lethal)
genes based on high throughput genetic screening is
available at BioGRID [46]. However, no curated database
of human SL gene pairs has been established yet. In
this study, BioGRID was used as the primary resource
to retrieve human cancer related SL gene pairs. The
phylogenetic inference from yeast to human genes was
obtained from the Ensemble database (http://useast.
ensembl.org/). Then, homolog human SL pairs were
filtered by cancer biomarkers in MetaCore (https://portal.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Cancer network
307,066 protein-protein interactions were
downloaded from HPRD [40]. Then, we used cancer
biomarkers from MetaCore and COSMIC [43] to filter
them. In details, we searched the keywords ‘cancer, tumor,
55363

carcinoma’ in MetaCore and retrieved 4,296 cancer related
biomarkers. At the same time, we also downloaded the
507 driver mutation genes collected in the Cancer Gene
Census from the website of COSMIC. All of these gene
mutations in Cancer Gene Census have been proved to
causally implicate in cancer. Then, for each proteinprotein interaction, only if both proteins are included in
MetaCore cancer biomarkers or Cancer Gene Census in
COSMIC, would the protein-protein interaction be kept.
Finally, we obtained 11,925 protein-protein interaction
pairs, corresponding to 2,869 individual proteins. The
cancer network could be built with edge presented by the
protein-protein interaction, as well as the node displayed
by a protein.

Driver mutation probability

Candidate SL pairs generation

Network information centrality

Herein, we utilized the R package DriverNet [47]
to evaluate the driver mutation probability of genes based
on the relationship between mutation and consequent
changes in gene expression. The input data of DriverNet
comes from two matrices, namely a mutation matrix and
its corresponding gene expression matrix. Each column of
the two matrices is a sample, whilst each row represents
the mutation status or expression level of a gene among
the samples. The output of DriverNet is the P value of
each gene that will likely be a driver of gene mutation.
The smaller P value of the two genes from a SL pair was
transformed to a negative log10 (P value) indicating the
strength of the driver mutation for the pair.
If G refers to the cancer network mentioned above,
and G’ refers to the cancer network after removing gene
A and gene B, then the network information centrality of
gene A and gene B could be defined as formula I:

We calculated the mutation rate of each gene
among the samples in the TCGA mutation data. Herein,
1% was utilized as the cut-off threshold to select the
candidate genes. Each raw candidate SL gene pair was
generated by selecting a candidate gene as well as the
other gene from the cancer network. Subsequently, we
tested whether gene A mutation and gene B mutation
are independent events based on the mutation data. In
detail, the null hypothesis is that gene A mutation and
gene B mutation are independent of each other. A Chisquare test was implemented on a 2×2 contingency
table (see Table 6). M represents the number of samples
carrying both gene A and gene B mutations; N represents
the number of samples carrying the gene A mutation
without the gene B mutation; X represents the number of
samples carrying the gene B mutation without the gene
A mutation; Y is the number of samples that containing
both wild type gene A and wild type gene B.
The raw candidate SL gene pairs with Chi-square
test p value <=0.05 means the mutation of gene A and
gene B are not independent. Maybe some relationships
exist between mutation of gene A and gene B. In addition,
the mutation exclusivity of gene A and gene B could be
calculated as (X+N)/(M+N+X). The higher mutation
exclusivity indicates the gene A and gene B are more
likely to be mutually exclusive mutations. Herein, only
candidate SL pairs with both Chi-square test P value ≤
0.05 and mutation exclusivity ≥ 0.8 were selected for the
downstream processing.

Herein, if gene i could reach gene j in cancer network,

package networkx), otherwise, dij is equal to D(G) + 1.
D(G) represents the diameter of cancer network, which
is defined as the largest distance across all of the shortest
paths in the cancer network (calculated through diameter
in python package networkx).
Finally, normalization of the three features was
taken to transform the values of each feature between 0-1
in formula III. x is the original value of a feature. x’ is the
normalized value.

A semi-supervised ranking model
The principle of our ranking model, which is
referred to as a manifold ranking algorithm [42, 48]
can be intuitively explained: the problem is defined in
two datasets, a true sample set and an unknown sample
set (background); and the goal is to rank the individual
members of the unknown sample set according to their
relevance to the true samples. This model is well suited
to address our problem scenario, which is that we only
have few known SL pairs in hand (known positive data
samples), and we want to prioritize the largest possible

Features calculation
Gene pair mutation coverage
It was defined as the percentage of samples
containing at least one gene mutation in the pair. For
example, gene A is mutated in samples s1,s3,s6, gene B
is mutated in samples s3,s8,s9. n is the total number of
samples. The mutation coverage of the pair (gene A,
gene B) is 5/n.

The original drug sensitivity data, drug targets as
well as the mutation backgrounds of cancer cell lines
in CCLE [21], NCI60 [22] were downloaded from
broadinstitute.org/ccle/home and discover.nci.nih.gov/
cellminer/, respectively. Regarding a SL gene pair, if
one of the genes in the SL pair is targeted by a drug, we
compared the drug sensitivities on the cell lines carrying
the mutation of the other genes in the pair and the cell
lines containing the wild type of the other genes. The
lower GI50 or IC50 value means higher drug sensitivity.

Evaluation test design
10 times 5-fold cross validation
For each case, the positive SL pairs were divided
into five segments. Four of them were used as training sets,
while the rest of the segments were used for evaluation.
Next, positive SL pairs were shuffled 10 times, the overall
performance was determined by the average results of
these 10 shuffling events.

algorithms in the field of information retrieval. It
can measure the usefulness of a document based on
its position in the result list. Here we used NDCG to
measure the effectiveness of ranking performance for
each case’s predicted results (see formula V ).

For example, regarding a SL gene pair gene a –
gene b, two cancer cell lines were selected. The first
cell line carried mutant gene a, while the wild type gene
a was carried in the other cell line. Then, the siRNA
of gene b was transfected into the two cell lines. We
recorded the cell growth of two cell lines at the time
points of 0h, 24h, 48h, 72h and 96h on two different
treatments: placebo, siRNA-knockdown of gene b,
respectively. Herein, we did 8 parallel experiments at
each time point. The relative cell growth was calculated
through the formula VII.
