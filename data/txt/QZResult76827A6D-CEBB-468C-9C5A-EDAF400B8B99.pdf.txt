BACKGROUND: This study was designed to evaluate the impact of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on incidence of
brain metastasis (brain metastasis) and overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC).
METHODS: All patients who presented with mRCC but no brain metastasis in the intervals 2002 to 2003 and 2006
to 2007 were identified using the institutional tumor registry. The following data were collected: age, sex, Fuhrman
grade, disease sites, nephrectomy, systemic therapy including TKIs (sorafenib or sunitinib), Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center risk category, brain metastasis treatment, and vital status. Statistical analysis was performed using the
Cox proportional hazards model and the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Of the 338 patients who were identified;
154 (46%) were treated with a TKI before brain metastasis, and 184 (54%) were not. There were no significant differences in age, histology, nephrectomy, involved sites of disease other than lung, or Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center risk category between the groups. Median OS was longer in the TKI-treated group (25 months vs 12.1 months,
P < .0001). In multivariate analysis, TKI treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.74;
P < .001) was associated with improved OS. Forty-four (13%) patients developed a brain metastasis, including 29
(15.8%) of the non-TKI group and 15 (9.7%) of the TKI group. The 5-year actuarial rate of brain metastasis was 40%
versus 17%, respectively (P < .001). TKI treatment was associated with lower incidence of brain metastasis in Cox multivariate analysis (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.21-0.73; P ¼ .003). Lung metastasis increased the risk of brain metastasis (HR,
9.61; 95% CI, 2.97-31.1; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with TKI agents reduces the incidence of brain metastasis

Cancers of the kidney and renal pelvis account for approximately 3.9% of all cancers in the United States, with an

estimated 57,760 new cases and 12,980 deaths in 2009.1 Most of these cancers arise in the kidney, and the most common
histological type, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), presents with metastatic disease in up to 30% of cases.2 The most common
sites of metastasis include lung, lymph nodes, and bone,2 with the brain involved in 10% to 20% of cases.3,4 Because metastatic RCC (mRCC) is generally resistant to chemotherapy, immunologic therapy with interferon or interleukin-2 (IL-2)
has been the most commonly used treatment, despite substantial toxicity5 and disappointingly low response rates (5%20%).2
The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has drastically altered the management of mRCC. These agents act
by inhibiting intracellular kinases in the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway, the up-regulation of which is central
to the pathogenesis of RCC.6-8 During the past 5 years, 3 TKIs, sunitinib, sorafenib, and pazopanib, were approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration for use in advanced RCC. Sunitinib was approved in 2006 for RCC after phase
2 and 3 trials9 demonstrated that sunitinib, given as first-line therapy, doubled the progression-free survival (PFS) time
compared with that obtained with interferon. Sorafenib was approved for RCC in 2005 after phase 3 trials similarly
showed that it improved PFS compared with placebo for patients with cytokine-refractory disease,10 and pazopanib was

approved in 2009 after another phase 3 trial showed that
it led to improved PFS compared with placebo for both
previously untreated and cytokine-refractory disease.11
The outcome for patients with RCC who develop
brain metastasis is typically poor, with median survival
times of only 4 to 11 months after diagnosis3,12 even after
surgical resection, whole-brain radiotherapy, or stereotactic radiosurgery. The influence of TKIs on the development or progression of brain metastasis has not yet been
clearly established. Several case reports have been published describing brain metastasis responding to treatment
with sunitinib or sorafenib,13,14 raising the possibility that
use of TKIs may improve the overall outcome for patients
with RCC and brain metastasis. In addition, a recent
review of patients enrolled in the TARGET trial found a
lower incidence of brain metastasis in the group that
received sorafenib,15 suggesting that these agents may also
help to prevent or delay the development of brain
metastasis.
In this retrospective analysis, we sought to evaluate
the effect of treatment with 1 of 2 TKIs, sunitinib and
sorafenib, on brain metastasis development in patients
with mRCC. Given the timing of the approval and
increasing use of these agents in early 2006, we selected
2 groups of patients, 1 that presented to The University
of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2002 to 2003
and the other in 2006 to 2007 with the expectation that
these periods would segregate patients by TKI exposure
status. We extracted a wide array of clinicopathologic
characteristics and used univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate potential treatment effects on the incidence of brain metastasis, time to the diagnosis of brain
metastasis, and outcomes, including survival and local
control, after systemic therapy or treatment of brain
metastasis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
The institutional review board of The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center approved this retrospective
analysis. Patients were identified by searching an institutional tumor registry database for those with stage IV clear
cell RCC who presented for evaluation at The University
of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2002 to 2003
or in 2006 to 2007. We excluded patients with sarcomatoid, papillary, or chromophobe features on histological
examination, as well as those who had brain metastasis at
their initial staging evaluation.

Data Review
The following data were extracted from medical records
for review: age; sex; ethnic group; Fuhrman nuclear grade;
involved sites of metastatic disease at diagnosis (including
liver, adrenal glands, lung, bone, retroperitoneal nodes,
and mediastinal nodes); whether the patient had undergone nephrectomy; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center risk category,16 a widely accepted risk stratification
method calculated using serum lactate dehydrogenase, hemoglobin, corrected serum calcium, performance status,
and time from diagnosis to systemic therapy; treatment
with the TKIs sunitinib or sorafenib or other systemic
agents; development of brain metastasis, treatment modality for brain metastasis, and location and treatment of
brain recurrence; vital status; and duration of follow-up.
To evaluate the potential effect of TKIs on brain metastasis development, patients were included in the TKI group
only if they had received the agent before a brain metastasis was diagnosed. Survival calculations included all
patients treated with TKIs regardless of when they
received the agent relative to the development of brain
metastasis.
Statistical Analysis
The frequencies of all clinical and pathological features
were compared by using the chi-square statistic. Continuous variables were compared using Student t test. Overall
survival, brain metastasis-free survival, and central nervous system (CNS) recurrence-free survival were estimated
by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients who had not
developed brain metastasis at last follow-up were censored
at that time. The Cox proportional hazards method17 was
used to evaluate the effect of patient, tumor, and other
predictor factors of significance on survival and development of brain metastasis for different groups. The estimated hazard is reported, and the Wald test was used to
assess the role of covariates in the model. All statistical
analysis was performed using Stata/MP 11.1 for
Windows.18

RESULTS
Patient Population
We identified 338 patients with stage IV clear cell mRCC
but without brain metastasis at diagnosis (Table 1). The
median age at diagnosis for all patients was 59 years
(range, 18-83 years); 138 (41%) patients had bone metastasis, and 220 (65%) had lung metastasis at diagnosis.

The median follow-up time for all patients was 16.2
months (range, 0-107 months).
Of the 338 patients, 154 (46%) had received a TKI
before the development of a brain metastasis, and 184
(54%) had not (Table 1). Six patients were first treated
with a TKI subsequent to the diagnosis of brain metastasis, and were considered in the non-TKI group for the
purpose of evaluating brain metastasis development. No
significant differences were found between the TKI and
non-TKI groups with respect to age, sex, ethnic group,
Fuhrman nuclear grade, having undergone nephrectomy,
or Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk score.
The non-TKI group had a higher incidence of lung metastasis at diagnosis than the TKI group (70% vs 59%, P ¼

.034); no other differences were found in sites of metastatic disease between the groups. As expected for patients
treated over 2 different periods, the systemic therapies
used were different for the TKI and non-TKI groups;
specifically, a higher percentage of patients in the nonTKI group received capecitabine, gemcitabine, interferon,
IL-2, or thalidomide, whereas more patients in the
TKI group had received bevacizumab, erlotinib, or
temsirolimus.
Overall Survival
The median overall survival time for all 338 patients was
19.1 months. Median survival time was longer in the TKI
group than in the non-TKI group (25 months vs 12.1

to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk
score, patients with low-risk disease (score of 0) had a median survival time of 79.6 months, those with intermediate-risk disease (score of 1-2) 23.5 months, and those with
high-risk disease (score of 3-5) 11.6 months (log-rank
P < .0001) (Fig. 1).
In Cox univariate analysis, receipt of TKI was associated with longer survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.64; P < .001). No other
systemic agent was associated with an increase in survival.
Other predictors of improved survival in the univariate
analysis were receipt of nephrectomy (HR, 0.28; 95% CI,
0.21-0.37; P < .001) and belonging to the 2006 to 2007
cohort (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55-0.92; P ¼ .009). Predictors of poor outcome included intermediate-risk or highrisk Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center score; performance status (>2 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] scale); presence of lung, liver,
retroperitoneal, or mediastinal lymph node metastasis at
diagnosis; and high Fuhrman nuclear grade (Table 3).
Most of these variables also retained their significance in

independent predictor of better survival (HR, 0.53; 95%
CI, 0.38-0.74; P < .001), and high Fuhrman grade, the
presence of lung or mediastinal nodal metastasis at diagnosis, and ECOG performance status >2 were significant
predictors of worse survival (Table 3).
Screening for Brain Metastasis
A total of 297 (88%) patients were documented to be free
of brain metastases on at least 1 computed tomography or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain, and
41 (12%) were not. Our institutional practice is to screen
asymptomatic patients for brain metastasis with annual
MRI. The median time between brain imaging, estimated
by dividing the time from diagnosis to last brain imaging
by the number of scans in the interim, was 3.6 months.
The median time from last brain imaging to the last clinical follow-up date was 2.4 months.
Brain Metastasis to Last Clinical Follow-Up
Of the 338 patients, 44 (13%) eventually developed brain
metastasis, including 29 (15.8%) patients in the non-TKI
group and 15 (9.7%) in the TKI group (P ¼ .10). Of the
44 patients, 21 (48%) had neurologic symptoms at the

(52%) were asymptomatic, with brain metastasis discovered on routine screening. The median time from diagnosis of mRCC to brain metastasis, in the 44 patients who
developed brain metastasis, was 10 months. The median
time to brain metastasis was 7.5 months in the non-TKI
group and 12.2 months in the TKI group (P ¼ .30).
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the rates of brain
metastasis at 1, 2, and 5 years were 11%, 18%, and 26%,
respectively. The actuarial rates of brain metastasis in the
non-TKI group were 16%, 25%, and 40% at 1, 2, and 5
years, respectively. The rates of brain metastasis in the
TKI group at the same time points were significantly

Brain Metastasis to Last Brain Imaging
We also performed Kaplan-Meier analysis using the date
of last brain imaging, instead of the last clinical follow-up,
as the endpoint. In this analysis, the actuarial rate of brain
metastasis in the non-TKI group at 1 and 2 years was 28%
and 37%, respectively. The rate of brain metastasis in the
TKI group was again significantly lower, at 15% and
15%, respectively (log-rank P ¼ .0017).
In Cox univariate analysis using last brain imaging
as the endpoint, receipt of TKI was again found to be
associated with a significant reduction in brain metastasis
(HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17-0.59; P < .001). Treatment
with bevacizumab or temsirolimus was also associated
with a reduced rate of brain metastasis (HR, 0.45; 95%
CI, 0.22-0.91; P ¼ .03). Mediastinal nodal metastasis
(HR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.01-3.70; P ¼ .05) and lung metastasis (HR, 9.46; 95% CI, 2.92-30.6; P ¼ <.001) were
associated with increased incidence of brain metastasis. In
Cox multivariate analysis, TKI treatment was associated
with lower incidence of brain metastasis (HR, 0.39; 95%
CI, 0.21-0.74; P ¼ .004), and lung metastasis was associated with higher risk of brain metastasis (HR, 8.11; 95%
CI, 2.49-26.4; P ¼ .001).
Landmark Analysis
Landmark analysis was performed beginning 3 and 6
months from diagnosis of RCC. In landmark analysis beginning 3 months after diagnosis, the 1-year and 2-year
rates of brain metastasis in the non-TKI group were 17%

Cancer

and 24.5%, respectively. These rates were significantly
lower than the rates at the same time points in the TKI
group (9% and 11.4%, respectively, P ¼ .002). In landmark analysis using the 6-month cutoff time, the 1-year
and 2-year rates of brain metastasis in the non-TKI group
were 5% and 14%, respectively, versus 4% and 6% in the
TKI group (P ¼ .14).
Outcomes After Brain Metastasis
Brain metastases were treated with a variety of methods,
alone or in combination, including observation, stereotactic radiosurgery, surgical resection, or whole brain radiotherapy. The median overall survival time after the
diagnosis of brain metastasis was 6.15 months and was no
different according to receipt of TKI (5.23 months for the
TKI group and 6.15 months for the non-TKI group, logrank P ¼ .33). Rates of local recurrence and development
of new CNS metastases were also no different for the
TKI group and the non-TKI group (log-rank P ¼ .32).
Outcomes are presented in Table 2.

DISCUSSION
In our analysis, we examined the development of brain
metastasis in a large, diverse cohort of patients with
advanced RCC and found that treatment with TKIs was
associated with both improved survival and a reduced
incidence of brain metastasis in patients with stage IV
RCC. Our results suggest that the use of TKIs is altering
the natural history of RCC by preventing the development of brain metastasis.
Although the impact of TKIs on mRCC is of great
interest given the lack of effective treatments for this disease, exactly how they influence the development or progression of brain metastasis is not yet known. In their
review of patients treated in the TARGET trial of sorafenib, Massard et al15 provided the first evidence suggesting
that TKIs may protect the brain from mRCC when they
reported that those who received sorafenib had a lower
incidence of brain metastasis versus placebo (12% vs 3%).
However, this study was limited by the relatively modest
number of patients (n ¼ 139), the inclusion of only
patients for whom first-line therapy had failed, and the
lack of multivariate analysis. In this context, our review of
338 patients extends the results reported by Massard et al
by including analysis of a wide range of clinicopathologic
criteria in a diverse group of patients, including those who
had not undergone any treatment; in addition, the large
number of patients in our study allowed us to perform

univariate and multivariate analysis to evaluate the contributions of specific variables.
Our Kaplan-Meier analysis showed the rates of brain
metastasis in the TKI group to be considerably lower than
those in the group that did not receive TKIs. These 2
groups were composed of patients with similar clinical
features, including Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center score, with the major difference being the type of
treatment received. As we expected, patients who were not
treated with TKIs tended to be treated with older agents
such as IL-2, capecitabine, gemcitabine, and thalidomide,
whereas more of the patients in the TKI group were
treated with newer agents: erlotinib, temsirolimus, and
bevacizumab. In multivariate analysis, receipt of TKI was
associated with significant protection from brain metastasis (HR, 0.39; P ¼ .003), and no other agent was associated with a reduction in brain metastasis in univariate or
multivariate analysis. We believe that the lower incidence
of brain metastasis observed can be attributed to receipt of
TKIs, further supporting their use for patients with
mRCC. Although temsirolimus, erlotinib, and bevacizumab did not account for the observed protection from
brain metastasis in our study, it is possible that these
agents have a protective role with regard to brain metastasis that was unable to be detected because of the small
numbers of patients in our sample who received those
agents. Further study is needed to properly evaluate their
influence on brain metastasis in mRCC.
Another interesting finding was that in our study,
lung metastasis was associated with a strong risk of developing a brain metastasis, with an HR >9 in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Of the 44 patients who
developed brain metastasis, 90% had had lung metastasis
at diagnosis, and only 2.5% of patients without lung metastasis at diagnosis ultimately developed a brain metastasis. A possible explanation is that the lung disease is a
nidus for metastasis to the brain, in which case we would
expect to observe lung metastasis to occur before brain
metastasis. A second explanation is that there are underlying characteristics of these tumor cells that predispose
them to metastasize to both lung and brain. In either case,
this finding suggests that the presence of lung metastasis
at diagnosis could be used as a tool to identify patients
with RCC at high risk for brain metastasis and increase
the surveillance of these patients accordingly. We further
found that the incidence of brain metastasis reached a
plateau at 4 years after the initial diagnosis, raising the
possibility that long-term survivors of RCC are at lower
risk for brain metastasis and perhaps might require less

frequent screening. Finally, the finding that approximately half of the patients with brain metastasis in our
cohort had asymptomatic brain metastasis discovered on
routine screening has implications for the appropriate
screening frequency for these patients. Our institutional
practice is to screen stable, asymptomatic patients with
mRCC for brain metastasis with annual MRI. Although
there is no consensus screening guideline for brain metastasis, our data suggest that routine screening is perhaps
indicated to detect a potentially high rate of asymptomatic
brain metastasis.
The appearance of brain metastasis from RCC
usually portends poor survival despite several options for
local treatment. We found no significant difference in survival between patients with brain metastasis who received
TKI drugs versus those who did not. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions from a small sample size of 44
patients, there are several possible explanations for this observation. First, we defined the TKI group as those who
received TKIs before brain metastasis, meaning that in all
cases brain metastasis represented progression after
exposure to the agent. Those patients may also have had
progression at other disease sites. Furthermore, progression
on TKIs could indicate the emergence of a resistant clone,
limiting the further utility of TKI treatment and thus
removing 1 treatment option. All of these factors could
negate the survival advantage of TKI drugs in this cohort.
In addition, we found no significant difference
between the groups in the rate of subsequent brain metastasis after first brain metastasis. With the same caveat of a
small sample size, and the additional consideration that
many patients with brain metastasis have poor follow-up
because of the nature of the disease, we offer a possible explanation for the reduced incidence of brain metastasis:
that TKI agents stabilize systemic sites of disease, and thus
reduce the number of circulating tumor cells with metastatic potential. This theory is somewhat supported by the
finding that lung metastasis was a strong risk factor for
future brain metastasis development. In this case, brain
metastasis development could signal the emergence of a
TKI-resistant clone, which the agent is no longer able to
contain. Further study is certainly needed to better understand the role of TKIs in patients with brain metastasis.
It remains unclear whether TKI agents in combination with local treatments such as surgery or radiotherapy
could improve local control or overall survival for patients
with RCC and brain metastasis. Some case reports have
described responses after treatment with sunitinib or
sorafenib alone, suggesting that some benefit may be

present. One recently published study reported that TKIs
had limited benefit for patients with RCC and brain metastasis,19 but that study included only 12 patients with
brain metastasis, and neither PFS nor overall survival was
statistically affected. To our knowledge, no study has evaluated outcomes of patients with RCC and brain metastasis according to TKI treatment status.
This study had some limitations, first among them
being its retrospective nature. Retrospective reviews are
inherently subject to bias, particularly selection bias.
Although we compared groups in terms of a variety of
clinicopathologic criteria, patients were not randomly
assigned to treatment groups. Clinical factors at the time
of treatment could lead to patients with a better prognosis
being preferentially assigned to 1 treatment or another,
confounding our results. Some patients in the earlier
cohort (2002-2003) had survived long enough to receive a
TKI; these survivors may have had underlying favorable
factors aside from receipt of a TKI that led to improved
outcomes. Finally, this retrospective review was limited to
the data available, which did not always include brain
imaging at preferred intervals.
In conclusion, in a diverse cohort of patients with
mRCC without brain metastasis, TKIs both provide a significant survival benefit and may reduce the incidence of
brain metastasis, further supporting their use in these
patients. The presence of lung metastasis may have value
in identifying patients at higher risk for brain metastasis
and adjusting surveillance accordingly. Further investigation is needed to characterize the role of TKI treatment in
the management and outcomes of patients after development of brain metastasis, and this remains a topic of great
interest in our group.
