Abstract
Adoptive immunotherapy using autologous T cells endowed
with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) has emerged as a powerful
means of treating cancer. However, a limitation of this approach is
that autologous CAR T cells must be generated on a custom-made
basis. Here we show that electroporation of transcription activator–like effector nuclease (TALEN) mRNA allows highly efﬁcient
multiplex gene editing in primary human T cells. We use this
TALEN-mediated editing approach to develop a process for the
large-scale manufacturing of T cells deﬁcient in expression of both
their ab T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD52, a protein targeted by
alemtuzumab, a chemotherapeutic agent. Functionally, T cells
manufactured with this process do not mediate graft-versus-host

reactions and are rendered resistant to destruction by alemtuzumab. These characteristics enable the administration of alemtuzumab concurrently or prior to engineered T cells, supporting
their engraftment. Furthermore, endowing the TALEN-engineered
cells with a CD19 CAR led to efﬁcient destruction of CD19þ tumor
targets even in the presence of the chemotherapeutic agent. These
results demonstrate the applicability of TALEN-mediated genome
editing to a scalable process, which enables the manufacturing of
third-party CAR T-cell immunotherapies against arbitrary targets.
As such, CAR T-cell immunotherapies can therefore be used in an
"off-the-shelf" manner akin to other biologic immunopharmaceuticals. Cancer Res; 75(18); 3853–64. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

with refractory disease, at unprecedented frequencies, has raised
hopes that the wider application of CAR technology may lead to a
revolution in cancer treatment.
At present, CAR technology is administered through the custom-made manufacturing of therapeutic products from each
patient's own T cells. However, this patient-speciﬁc autologous
paradigm is a signiﬁcant limiting factor in the large-scale deployment of CAR technology as it requires either execution by a skilled
team, with dedicated access to a Good Manufacturing Practice
(GMP)–compliant facility or substantial investment in a centralized processing infrastructure. In addition, delays inherent to
the generation of a therapeutic product preclude immediate
administration, thus prejudicing favorable outcomes for the most
critically ill patients. Also, custom-made autologous product
generation may not be feasible for patients who are profoundly
lymphopenic owing to previous chemotherapy.
Here, we describe a platform for the mass production of "offthe-shelf" CAR T cells from unrelated third-party donor T cells. We
overcome the key barriers to the adoptive transfer of third-party
CAR T cells via the application of transcription activator–like
effector nuclease (TALEN) gene-editing technology. We therefore
eliminate the potential for T cells bearing alloreactive ab T-cell
receptors (TCR) to mediate graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) by
disrupting the TCRa constant (TRAC) gene and we exploit the
requirement of lymphodepletion for engraftment of third-party
CAR T cells by the disruption of the target of a chemotherapeutic
agent. For proof of concept, we chose to target the CD52 gene that
codes for the protein targeted by alemtuzumab. Simultaneous

Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) are generated by fusing the
antigen-binding region of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) or other
ligands to membrane-spanning and intracellular-signaling
domains derived from lymphocyte activation receptors (1–11).
When expressed in primary human T cells, CARs take advantage of
potent cellular effector mechanisms without the limitations of
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction. The potential of this approach has recently been demonstrated in clinical
studies where T cells endowed with CARs were administered to
adult and pediatric cancer patients (11–18). The achievement of
durable remissions and signiﬁcant objective responses in patients

editing of the TRAC and CD52 genes results in TCR/CD52deﬁcient T cells, which can be administered with, or following,
alemtuzumab treatment. Alemtuzumab mediates lymphodepletion/immunosuppression thereby promoting engraftment. We
provide proof of concept for the general application of this
approach by manufacturing a TCR/CD52-deﬁcient CD19 CAR
T cell (dKO-CART19). We demonstrate that this product does
not mediate alloreactivity and that it can be selectively
engrafted in the presence of alemtuzumab, while maintaining
antitumor activity indistinguishable from standard CD19 CAR
T cells in an orthotopic CD19þ lymphoma murine model. The
manufacturing platform is highly reproducible, thus suitable
for use in the large-scale manufacturing of CAR T-cell products
directed against arbitrary targets for administration as "off-theshelf" immunopharmaceuticals.

Materials and Methods
Cells
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained
from healthy volunteer donors. T-lymphocytes were puriﬁed
using the EasySep human T-cell enrichment kit (Stemcell Technologies) or directly activated from PBMCs.
Lymphoma cells for bioluminescent imaging were generated by
transfection of Raji cells (ATCC-CCL86) or lentiviral transduction
of Daudi cells (ATCC-CCL213) with an expression cassette for
ﬁreﬂy luciferase (Raji-fﬂuc, Daudi-fﬂuc). All cell lines were used
less than 6 months after resuscitation or receipt from ATCC, where
short tandem repeat analysis is used to authenticate human cell
lines.
TALENs
CD52 and TRAC TALEN were obtained from Cellectis Bioresearch. The target sequence for TRAC and CD52 TALENs are
TTGTCCCACAGATATCCagaaccctgaccctgCCGTGTACCAGCTGAGA
and TTCCTCCTACTCACCATcagcctcctggttatGGTACAGGTAAGAGCAA, respectively, where two 17-bp recognition sites (upper
case letters) are separated by a 15-bp spacer.
mRNA synthesis
mRNAs were synthesized using the mMessage mMachine T7
Ultra kit (Life Technologies). RNAs were puriﬁed with RNeasy
columns (Qiagen) and eluted in water or cytoporation medium T
(Harvard Apparatus). Following process optimization, TALEN
mRNAs were produced by a commercial manufacturer (Trilink
Biotechnologies).
CARs
Second-generation CD19 CARs were constructed using singlechain antibody fragments derived from antibody clones fmc63
(19) or 4g7 (20), hinge and transmembrane regions from CD8A,
intracellular domain from TNFRSF9 (CD137), and intracellular
domain from CD247 (CD3-zeta). CD19 CARs were cloned into a
commercial lentiviral vector backbone downstream from an EF1a
promoter and concentrated lentiviral vectors were produced by
Vectalys.
Animal studies
NSG mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) were obtained
from Charles River. NOG mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Sug/
JicTac) were obtained from TACONIC. In vivo experiments were

3854 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

performed either at Oncodesign or at UCL. All animal model
experiments were carried out in accordance with experimental
protocols explicitly approved for compliance with all institutional
policies.
All injections were via tail vein. For antitumor activity, 6- to
8-week old NSG mice were injected with tumor cells and later, at
the indicated time, with engineered or control T cells. For bioluminescence imaging, mice were anesthetized and imaged using a
Xenogen IVIS Imaging System (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). In the
xenogeneic GvHD model, TCR-negative or TCR-positive T cells
were injected in 8- to 10-week-old NOG mice 1 day after wholebody irradiation (2.5 Gy). Mortality, clinical signs, behavior,
animal body weights, and GvHD signs were monitored and
recorded daily. Animals were euthanized if they were observed
to be suffering (cachexia, weakening, difﬁculty moving, or eating),
have compound toxicity (hunching, convulsions), have 15%
body weight loss over a period of 3 consecutive days, or 20%
body weight loss from randomization day. An autopsy was
performed in each case.
Statistical analysis of in vivo data
A log-rank test was used to compare survival data. The Student t
test was used to compare tumor burdens measured by bioluminescence. A one-tailed Fisher exact probability test was used to
compare the incidence of GvHD.
Mutagenesis analysis
PCR ampliﬁcations spanning TRAC or CD52 targets or 15
in silico predicted potential offsite targets (named dKOffsite115) were performed from gDNA using primers described in
Online Supplementary Methods. Puriﬁed PCR products were
sequenced using a 454 sequencing system (454 Life Sciences).
Approximately 10,000 sequences were obtained per PCR product
and analyzed for the presence of site-speciﬁc mutations.
Translocation analysis
Translocation events between CD52 and TRAC loci were
detected by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using primers described in
Online Supplementary Methods. Ampliﬁcation efﬁciencies and
copy numbers were determined using plasmids containing the
expected translocation events.

Results
Functional inactivation of human TRAC and CD52 genes by
TALENs
TALENs were designed to recognize and cleave the coding
sequences of human TRAC and CD52 genes (Fig. 1A), and their
activity was validated in HEK293 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). As
plasmid DNA transfection induces toxicity in primary T cells, we
developed an mRNA electrotransfer method to express TALENs in
T-lymphocytes for the purpose of genome editing. We used mRNA
encoding GFP to assess transfection efﬁciency and obtained
homogenous GFP expression in more than 95% of cells (Fig.
1B). Five days after TALEN transfection, we analyzed surface
expression of CD52 and TCRab and observed that 63% and
78% of the T cells had lost surface expression of the molecule
targeted by CD52 and TRAC TALEN, respectively (Fig. 1C).
When combining TALEN treatments by cotransfection with
the 4 mRNAs encoding the CD52 and TRAC TALENs, we
achieved high levels of CD52/TCR-negative double knockout

(dKO) cells (Fig. 1C). Over the duration of this study, we found
that the variation in the efﬁciency of gene targeting was mostly
a result of TALEN mRNA format or quality, cell handling, and—
to a lesser degree—donor-to-donor variation. We obtained on
average 12.2% (2.96%) of dKO cells when using RNA from
small batch preparations, polyadenylated with the bacterial
enzyme Escherichia coli poly(A) polymerase. We modiﬁed the
cell handling process by optimizing the timing of media
changes and the cellular density during electroporation. The
mRNAs were optimized by using a plasmid template containing the 30 -untranslated region of the mouse Hba gene between
the TALEN coding sequence and a 120-base long poly-A tail.
RNAs were produced in large batches, dissolved in electroporation buffer, and stored in single-use aliquots. After the optimization process, we observed an average of 53.7% (12.9%)
of dKO cells over a series of 8 independent experiments
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

As TALENs possess high-afﬁnity DNA-binding domains
(21–26), we demonstrated that loss of expression following
TALEN transfection was not due to transient transcriptional inhibition via RNA polymerase blockade: Whereas mRNA-mediated
protein expression is transient (GFP expression is undetectable at 7
days posttransfection), we observed that the loss of TCRab/CD52
surface expression was stable over 2 weeks of culture (Fig. 1D).
These data are consistent with a stable gene inactivation event and
also suggest that TCR/CD52-deﬁcient T cells are not at a disadvantage in terms of proliferation. To conﬁrm that the loss of CD52
expression could be entirely accounted for by gene inactivation
events, CD52 genomic sequences from puriﬁed TALEN-treated
CD52-negative cells were analyzed using high-throughput
sequencing. We found that 92% of the 2,000 sequences obtained
exhibited insertions and/or deletions predicted to result in the loss
of the extracellular domain of CD52 located downstream from the
TALEN target site (compared with 19% in the unsorted cells, Fig. 1E

and F). Thus, loss of surface CD52 following electrotransfer of
TALEN mRNA can be accounted for by stable mutations in the
CD52 gene. For the TRAC gene, 49% of alleles were mutated in
TCR-negative enriched cells (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 and
Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). As the vast majority of mature
T-lymphocytes only express one TCRa chain at their cell surface
(allelic exclusion), they can become functionally TCR-negative
while only having the productive allele inactivated by TALEN.

Functional characterization of human T-lymphocytes after
TALEN-mediated CD52 or TRAC inactivation
Complement-dependent lysis of CD52-deﬁcient cells and TCR
stimulation of TCR-deﬁcient cells were used to evaluate the functional consequence of CD52 and TRAC gene inactivation, respectively (Fig. 2A–E). In vitro, we demonstrated that, following TALEN
transfection, CD52-negative cells are resistant to anti-CD52–

demonstrate that the TALEN-mediated CD52 KO was compatible
with cell engraftment, as well as sufﬁcient to render T cells resistant to alemtuzumab in vivo, we administered unsorted CD52
"TALENized" T cells to NSG mice and, 1 week later, treated the
mice with either alemtuzumab or vehicle. In control mice, CD52negative and -positive T cells were engrafted equally, in proportion
to the input T-cell population. However, in alemtuzumab-treated
mice, the CD52-positive T cells were completely depleted in the
spleen (Fig. 2B), blood, and bone marrow (not shown). TALENmediated inactivation of the TRAC gene was also shown to prevent
responses to TCR stimulation, as TCR-negative cells failed to blast
or upregulate the activation markers CD69 and CD25 upon phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-mediated TCR stimulation (Fig. 2C).
Abrogation of TCR-mediated cell activation via TRAC-KO was
conﬁrmed in vivo where T cells treated with both TRAC and CD52
TALENs, followed by magnetic depletion of remaining TCR-positive cells, were unable to initiate xenogeneic GvHD after infusion
into irradiated NOG immunodeﬁcient mice (Fig. 2E). In contrast,
all mice injected with mock-transfected T cells and maintained in
culture for the same time developed GvHD. Furthermore, the
antitumor activity of TCR-deﬁcient T cells was not compromised,

3858 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

as CD19 CAR-transduced TCR-deﬁcient T cells exhibited antitumor
activity indistinguishable from standard CD19 CAR T cells in
anorthotopic human CD19þ Raji-fﬂuc lymphoma model in NSG
immunodeﬁcient mice (Fig. 2D; ref. 27). This suggests that the loss
of TCRab expression does not grossly diminish the antitumor
activity of CAR T cells. Together, these results demonstrate that
TALEN mRNA electroporation is an efﬁcient means to inactivate
genes for the purpose of creating engineered T cells with stable,
functional phenotypes.
Genomic integrity of TALEN-treated cells
As TALENs use a FokI domain that is activated upon homodimerization, an important question for the utilization of multiplex transfection of TALEN constructs is whether multiplexing
engenders signiﬁcant genotoxicity through off-target cleavage at
"close match" sequences in the genome or at sequences recognized by mispaired half-TALENs. To address the potential for
genotoxicity of our TRAC and CD52 TALEN reagents, we used
recent data quantifying the impact of a substitution in a target
sequence on the efﬁciency of TALEN cleavage (28) to ﬁnd potential off-target sequences (Online Supplementary Methods). We

identiﬁed 173 unique sequences with a score reﬂecting an estimation of the likelihood of cleavage. As recent data suggest that
TALENs are unlikely to cleave any noncognate target with >3
mismatches per half site (28), we selected the 15 top scores as the
most likely targets. Using deep sequencing analysis, we then
examined the frequency of mutations found at these loci in
TCR/CD52-deﬁcient T cells (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Table S3).
The highest observed frequency of insertion/deletion at any of the
offsite targets was 1 in 8  104 (black bars)—a rate that is
statistically indistinguishable from what we observed in control
amplicons (gray bars). These results demonstrate an exceptionally
low rate of offsite target cleavage—at least 600 times less likely
than the intended targets. We attribute this high level of speciﬁcity
to the long recognition sequences of TALEN reagents, the selection
of TALEN target sites to avoid close offsite targets, and the
homogeneous expression provided by mRNA electroporation.
The genomic integrity of TALEN-treated cells was also considered with respect to the occurrence of translocations in cells
treated with two TALENs simultaneously. We designed qPCR
assays to detect the four possible translocations between chromosomes 1 and 14 (Fig. 3B). We measured the frequency of translocation in gDNA from cells transfected with CD52 and TRAC
TALENs. Translocation frequencies ranged from 104 to 2  102,
with translocations resulting in acentromeric or dicentromeric
chromosomes occurring the least frequently (Fig. 3C, left, note
that the acentric T2 translocation occurred at a very low frequency
approaching the detection limit of our assay). To understand
whether these translocations conferred a proliferative advantage,
we used puriﬁed CD52/TCRab cells and isolated gDNA after 15
and 38 days (2 days) in culture—approximating the period of
time when these cells would be most abundantly engrafted in a
patient. Despite the fact that the cells expanded more than 4,000fold between the two culture samplings (not shown), frequencies
of all of the translocations were found to be stable or reduced
(Fig. 3D), providing strong evidence that TRAC/CD52 translocations do not provide a proliferative advantage.

In vitro functional characterization of TCR/CD52-deﬁcient
T cells endowed with CD19 CAR
To evaluate the functional properties of gene-edited T cells, we
used CAR transduction and TALEN electroporation to generate
TCR/CD52-deﬁcient CD19 CAR T cells (these double-knockout
CAR19 T cells are herein referred to as dKO-CART19 cells), and
characterized their surface phenotype and cytotoxic function.
dKO-CART19 cells were indistinguishable from unmodiﬁed cells
in terms of their distribution between na€ve, effector, and memory
subsets as indicated by CD62L/CD45RA expression (Fig. 4A). To
determine dKO-CART19 responses to a tumor antigen, we evaluated CD19-mediated T-cell activation by monitoring surface
expression of CD107a (indicative of the release of cytotoxic
granules or degranulation; ref. 29) following coculture of dKOCART19 cells with cells with or without the CD19 antigen. As
shown in Fig. 4C, we observed an increase in the frequency of
CD107aþ dKO-CART19 cells only when CARþ cells were cocultured with CD19-expressing Daudi cells. This degranulation was
dependent on the presence of the CAR, as nontransduced T cells
did not degranulate in the presence of Daudi cells. Furthermore,
degranulation of CART19 cells was quantitatively indistinguishable between unmodiﬁed T cells and dKO cells. The same was true
when using other cellular targets, that is, SupT1 cells engineered to
express CD19 compared with control parental SupT1 cells (not
shown). These results were conﬁrmed by quantiﬁcation of IFNg
secretion by ELISA after a 24-hour incubation of the same coculture (Fig. 4B).

Genome Editing for Allogenic Adoptive T-cell Immunotherapy

transduction step at 72 hours to allow for the expression of a CAR,
and ﬁnally a TALEN mRNA electroporation step for TRAC/CD52
gene disruption at 120 hours. Subsequent to the TALEN electroporation step, the cells are cultured in a closed system for 10 to 12
days followed by magnetic depletion of remaining TCRab-positive
cells. Using this process, TCR/CD52-deﬁcient CAR T cells were
manufactured with highly reproducible yields (Fig. 5B), levels of
genome modiﬁcation (Fig. 5C), and cell phenotype (Fig. 5D).
dKO-CART19 T cells are functional in the presence of
alemtuzumab and maintain antitumor activity equivalent to
standard CAR T cells
The functional and antitumor properties of cells manufactured
with the aforementioned optimized process were evaluated using
orthotopic human CD19þ lymphoma xenograft models. In the
ﬁrst experiment, dKO-CART19 cells (CAR-transduced T cells electroporated with CD52 and TRAC-TALENs followed by depletion of
remaining TCR-positive cells) were assessed for their performance
in the presence and absence of alemtuzumab (Fig. 6A). For this
experiment, a Raji-fﬂuc cell line was treated with the TALEN
targeting CD52 (CD52-edited Raji-fﬂuc); the cell line derived from
TALEN treatment was maintained as a bulk cellular population
where not all CD52 alleles were inactivated. The CD52-edited Rajifﬂuc cells therefore consisted in a heterogenous mixture of CD52deﬁcient and CD52-sufﬁcient cells to recapitulate situations where
alemtuzumab only results in a partial response and tumor growth
is only delayed by treatment. Alemtuzumab was injected 1 day
prior to CD52-edited Raji-fﬂuc cell injection, and dKO-CART19
cells were infused the following day. All of the mice that received
tumor cells but no dKO-CART19 cells showed tumor progression,
leading to their sacriﬁce by 13 days postinjection. In 5 of the 7 mice
that received tumor and dKO-CART19 cells, the tumor was
completely controlled at day 13 and in the remaining two mice,
partial responses were observed. In contrast, alemtuzumab treatment was observed to only delay progression of the CD52-edited
Raji-fﬂuc tumor without T-cell infusion (6 of 6 mice)—a result
analogous to those observed when alemtuzumab is used to treat
high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia in humans (30). Strikingly, in mice treated with alemtuzumab combined with dKOCART19 cells, the tumor was completely eliminated from their
preferred engraftment niche, bone marrow [assessed by luminometry (Fig. 6B) or ﬂow cytometry from bone marrow cells 13 days
postinjection (Fig. 6C)]. To conﬁrm antitumor activity against
another tumor cell line and obtain a relative assessment of potency
of dKO-CART19 cells in comparison to standard CART19 cells, we
used a Daudi-fﬂuc tumor cell xenograft model without concomitant alemtuzumab treatment (as this would eliminate the CART19
cells) and extended the periods of monitoring (Fig. 6D). For this
experiment, Daudi-fﬂuc tumor cells were injected either 7 days or 1
day before injection of CD19 CAR T cells. Tumor burdens were

consecutively monitored via luminescence imaging for the ﬁrst 3
weeks, and mice were monitored over an 8-week period for clinical
signs of tumor evolution and survival. Tumor progression resulting
in death occurred around day 25 in all animals that received
nonmodiﬁed T cells. However, animals that received dKO-CART19
cells and CART19 cells either 1 day or 7 days post-tumor
cell injection survived signiﬁcantly longer (40 days or more),
with no difference in survival curves between mice that received
dKO-CART19 or CART19 cells. The differences between the
group receiving nonmodiﬁed T cells and all other groups were
statistically signiﬁcant. From these data, we conclude that the
manufacturing method used to generate TCR/CD52-deﬁcient CAR
T cells results in little or no compromise of their function in the
presence of alemtuzumab or in their CD19-directed antitumor
potency relative to non-"TALENized" CD19 CAR T cells.

Discussion
Here we demonstrate the development of a practical platform
for the manufacture of T cells from third-party donors for use in
adoptive T-cell therapies. Our platform involves the use of
TALEN-mediated genome editing to simultaneously knock out
two genes in the third-party T cells. The ﬁrst KO—the disruption
of the TRAC gene—eliminates TCRab expression and abrogates
the third-party T-cell's potential for GvHD, whereas a second KO
is used to render the third-party T cells resistant to a lymphodepleting/immunosuppressive agent and prevent their rejection by
the patient. For an initial proof of concept, we chose to knock out
CD52, a target of the lymphodepleting monoclonal antibody
alemtuzumab, based on the rationale that alemtuzumab could
be used for selective host lymphodepletion to create a receptive
environment for TCR/CD52-deﬁcient T-cell engraftment.
To achieve the simultaneous KO of two genes in primary human
T cells, we developed and optimized a method for the electroporation of TALEN mRNAs into T cells. The optimized method results
in no immediate visible toxic effects on the cells and achieves
double KO rates consistently greater than 40% at the targeted loci.
Furthermore, the transduction of a CAR gene cassette and the
TALEN electroporation step were incorporated into a 2-week, largescale process for the GMP manufacturing of TCRab/chemotherapy-resistant CAR T cells. The speciﬁcity properties of our TALENs
were associated with rates of off-target cleavage below the detection
limits of our deep sequencing assay (<1 in 103), a rate lower than
that reported for other genome-editing platforms (26, 30–33). We
attribute this observation to the inherent speciﬁcity properties of
TALENs coupled with careful selection of target sites to avoid other
genomic sites potentially susceptible to cleavage (21). While the
simultaneous dual gene-editing step of our process led to the
expected generation of translocations between the two doublestrand break sites, we detected no evidence of growth advantage for

cells harboring any of the 4 possible translocations over 12 generations of in vitro culture. On the basis of these analyses, we
conclude that TALEN-mediated genome editing can be incorporated into a large-scale T-cell culture process as a practical and safe
approach to the manufacturing of third-party CAR T cells for use in
adoptive T-cell immunotherapies.
Zinc ﬁnger nucleases have previously been applied for gene
editing in human T cells, including inactivation of both the
TCRa and TCRb genes for enabling allogeneic "off-the-shelf"
and TCR replacement strategies and inactivation of an HLA
class I gene (34–36). Our observations, regarding the functional capabilities of TRAC KO T cells, are consistent with the results
described in the aforementioned publications; T cells lacking a
TCR component lose CD3 expression and all capacity for
activation via either the TCR or through the CD3 complex.
Our results also signiﬁcantly extend previous results, as we have
demonstrated the potential of the simultaneous inactivation of
a second gene without deleterious effects on T-cell function. We
have also shown that "double KO" CD19 CAR T cells can be
efﬁciently and consistently manufactured and that the in vivo
antitumor activity of manufactured TCR/CD52-deﬁcient CD19
CAR T cells, in the presence or absence of alemtuzumab, is
indistinguishable from that of a standard CD19 CAR T cell in an
orthotopic lymphoma model.
A fundamental aspect of our approach is the use of TALEN geneediting technology to simultaneously inactivate the TCR and a
target of a lymphodepleting immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic as a potential means of supporting third-party T-cell
engraftment across MHC barriers. For an initial proof of concept,
we chose to generate T cells deﬁcient in the pan–lymphoid surface
marker protein CD52. The KO of CD52 is easily assessed by ﬂow
cytometry, and elimination of CD52 renders cells resistant to the
lytic properties of alemtuzumab (37–40)—a therapeutic monoclonal antibody that binds to CD52. Alemtuzumab has been
used extensively for the treatment of lymphoid malignancies,
including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, where it has been
shown to result in a profound reduction of B cells, T cells, as
well as natural killer (NK) cells (41). In addition, use of alemtuzumab to deplete T cells in hematopoietic stem cell transplants
("Campath in the bag") potently suppresses alloreactivity,
highlighting its potential for use in engraftment of T cells across
MHC barriers (37–40). While its long in vivo half-life precludes
its use as a lymphodepleting agent for standard adoptive immunotherapies due to targeting of both host and adoptively transferred cells, disruption of CD52 expression, as demonstrated here,
would allow T cells to be used following, or in conjunction with,
alemtuzumab to simultaneously achieve both host cell depletion
and adoptive T-cell engraftment. This approach would be of
particular interest for the treatment of patients with chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, in particular relapsed patients, where
alemtuzumab is a treatment option. However, it should be noted
that the limited availability of this antibody may prevent its
systematic use in all patients. Thus, an alternative approach to
allow engraftment of the cells described in this work would be to
use standard lymphodepletion regimens, similar to those in
autologous trials, such as cyclophosphamide and ﬂudarabine.
The use of allogenic CAR T cells following lymphodepletion by
alemtuzumab or another agent would result in their transient
engraftment, the cells being eliminated upon the reconstitution
of the patient's immune system. Although the importance of
sustained persistence of CARþ T cells in the blood is unknown,

3862 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

previous autologous CD19 CAR studies have shown that signiﬁcant proliferation occurs rapidly with maximum CARþ cell numbers observed 7 to 17 days after injection (18, 42). In these studies,
the clinical response is evaluated 28 days after treatment with a
large fraction of complete responses occurring within this time
frame. Thus, ideally the duration of lymphodepletion in an allogenic approach would be limited: sufﬁcient to provide CAR T cells
time to proliferate and eliminate cancer cells while minimizing
potential secondary effects due to prolonged lymphodepletion.
A particularly signiﬁcant aspect of our results is the demonstration of a GMP-compatible scalable process for manufacturing
third-party T cells deﬁcient in two gene products. We propose that
this process could serve as a general platform to enable the
production of "off-the-shelf" T-cell immunotherapies—we estimate that a single production run, starting from an apheresis
product containing 109 T cells, would allow the production of
1010 CAR dKO T cells—sufﬁcient to treat in the range of more than
500 patients at 1 to 2  107 cells per dose (e.g., the lowest biologically effective dose deﬁned by Kalos and colleagues; ref. 13). As
the same manufacturing method can be used to generate T-cells
expressing different CARs or be endowed with alternative chemotherapy resistance (e.g., HPRT KO for resistance to 6-MP, GR KO for
resistance to glucocorticoids; ref. 43), it has signiﬁcant potential
to enable CAR therapies to be extended to a much wider range of
patients than present custom-made CAR T-cell products.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that TALEN-mediated gene
editing can be used in a large-scale process for manufacturing
third-party CAR T-cell therapies—engineered T cells can be premanufactured from healthy third-party donors. These T cells can be
endowed with CAR or engineered TCR, of an arbitrary speciﬁcity,
that enables their tumor cell killing capabilities. Furthermore, the
engraftment of these engineered T cells, into any patient, can be
further supported when administered with a chemotherapeutic
agent (following or concomitantly with treatment) to which they
have been engineered for resistance. Our results also suggest that we
are just scratching the surface of the potential for genome editing to
enhance CAR T-cell therapies. With an increasingly detailed knowledge of tumor evasion mechanisms and T-cell checkpoints (44, 45),
it appears that there may be multiple avenues through which
genome editing could be applied to render CAR T-cell tumor
evasion resistant and increase their potency.
