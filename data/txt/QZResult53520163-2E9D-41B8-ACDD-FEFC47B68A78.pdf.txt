BACKGROUND. The current study evaluated the effect of bevacizumab added to
fluoropyrimidine-plus-oxaliplatin (5FU/OX) chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases (CLM) on the pathologic response and nontumorous liver histology.

METHODS. A total of 105 consecutive patients treated preoperatively with 5FU/OX
chemotherapy with (n 5 62) or without (n 5 43) bevacizumab were analyzed.
The response to chemotherapy was evaluated by pathologic analysis of tumor viability (percentage of viable tumor in relation to tumor surface area). The incidence and grade of hepatic sinusoidal dilation were also investigated.

RESULTS. Bevacizumab-containing regimens significantly reduced the degree of
tumor viability compared with 5FU/OX-only chemotherapy (32.9% vs 45.3%; P
5 .02). After stratification according to the magnitude of tumor viability, a higher
proportion of patients treated with bevacizumab than without had <25% residual

viable tumor cells (45% vs 23%; P 5 .02). However, the addition of bevacizumab
to 5FU/OX did not appear to increase the incidence of complete pathologic
response (11.3% vs 11.6%; P 5 .59). The incidence and severity of sinusoidal dilation was lower in patients treated with bevacizumab than in those treated with
5FU/OX only (any grade: 27.4% vs 53.5%; moderate or severe: 8.1% vs 27.9%;
both P < .01).

CONCLUSIONS. In patients treated with 5FU/OX chemotherapy, bevacizumab
improves the pathologic response, as demonstrated by a reduction of the degree
of tumor viability, and reduces the incidence and severity of hepatic injury. This
retrospective study provides additional evidence supporting the use of bevacizumab in combination with 5FU/OX for CLM. Cancer 2007;110:2761–7.  2007

defined as a reduction of tumor size, is also emphasized by its conventional use for treatment efficacy
assessment.7 However, this simple, macroscopic criterion for tumor response evaluation may not be
enough per se to determine the effectiveness of a
treatment.8 Pathologic analysis of tumor viability
represents an alternative method to evaluate tumor
response after preoperative treatments. Recent data
indicate that preoperative chemotherapy results in a
reduction or disappearance of viable tumor cells,9 and
assessment of residual viable tumor cells has been
used to compare the efficacy of different preoperative
treatments.10
As more patients receive preoperative systemic
chemotherapy, clinically significant chemotherapyspecific hepatic injuries are increasingly being
reported.4,11–13 We recently reported a 20% incidence
of steatohepatitis in association with irinotecan-based
chemotherapy and a 19% incidence of sinusoidal
injury after treatment with oxaliplatin.4 In 2 series
reporting on patients who received mostly oxaliplatin-based preoperative chemotherapy, the authors
reported a higher rate of sinusoidal injury and an
increase in perioperative blood transfusions and surgical complications in patients who received preoperative chemotherapy than in those who did not.11,12
In patients with advanced metastatic colorectal
cancer, targeted biologic therapy with bevacizumab, a
recombinant human monoclonal antibody to vascular
endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), has recently
been used in association with 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. Preliminary data from these studies indicate an increase in radiologic response rate
and survival with the combination of bevacizumab
and cytotoxic chemotherapy.14–16 However, to our
knowledge, the efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy in patients undergoing preoperative chemotherapy followed by liver resection has
not been published to date, and it is not known
whether the combination of bevacizumab and cytotoxic therapy improves pathologic response or affects
hepatic injury of the nontumorous liver.4,11
The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of bevacizumab added to fluoropyrimidine-plus-oxaliplatin chemotherapy administered
before hepatic resection for CLM. To achieve this
objective, we reviewed a consecutive series of
patients who received preoperative fluoropyrimidineplus-oxaliplatin chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab to answer the following questions: Does
bevacizumab 1) increase the response of CLM as
measured by systematic pathologic analysis of tumor
viability? and 2) affect the incidence of sinusoidal
dilation?

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From the hepatobiliary database of the University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, we identified 105 consecutive patients who underwent liver
resection for CLM after preoperative fluoropyrimidine-plus-oxaliplatin (5FU/OX) chemotherapy with
or without bevacizumab between November 2002
and July 2006. In the group that received bevacizumab, the last dose was administered 6 or more
weeks before surgery.17 With the aim of maximizing
tumor response, 1 additional cycle of 5FU/OX was
usually administered after bevacizumab was discontinued. To ensure homogeneity within groups,
patients treated at any time before hepatic resection with drugs other than fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab were excluded. This study
was approved by our Institutional Review Board
(IRB #RCR06-0712).
Demographic and clinical data were obtained
by reviewing medical records. A single gastrointestinal pathologist with hepatobiliary expertise (H.W.),
blinded to the chemotherapy regimens with which
individual patients had been treated, evaluated the
resected specimens. Nontumorous liver tissue was
reviewed to define the presence and grade of sinusoidal dilation according to a previously reported
standard 4-point scale on which 0 indicated the absence of sinusoidal dilation, 1 indicated mild sinusoidal dilation (centrilobular involvement limited to
approximately one-third of the lobular surface), 2
indicated moderate sinusoidal dilation (centrilobular involvement extending in approximately twothirds of the lobular surface), and 3 indicated
severe sinusoidal dilation (complete lobular involvement).4,18 The tumoricidal effect of chemotherapy was analyzed using a previously defined
methodology19 as follows. On routine hematoxylin
& eosin-stained sections the area of residual viable
tumor cells within each metastatic nodule was estimated as a percentage of the total tumor surface
area that includes areas of coagulative necrosis,
calcification, fibrosis, and the associated histiocytes, foreign body giant cells, and inflammatory
cells (Fig. 1). All archival slides, for an average of
2 to 3 sections per tumor nodule, were reviewed.
When multiple tumors were present, the mean
percentage was used.
Continuous variables, presented as means with
standard error of the mean unless otherwise stated,
were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test; discrete variables, expressed as the number and percentage, were compared using the chi-square test or
Fisher exact test, when appropriate. Statistical significance was defined as P < .05.

RESULTS
Forty-three patients received 5FU/OX without bevacizumab and 62 received 5FU/OX with bevacizumab.
Clinical and pathologic characteristics for the

Pathologic Response
A total of 285 tumor nodules were reviewed. Pathologic
analysis revealed that treatment with 5FU/OX only
was associated with significantly greater percentage of
residual viable tumor cells compared with treatment
with 5FU/OX plus bevacizumab (45.3%  3.7 vs 32.9%
 3.5; P 5 .02) (Fig. 2A). When patients were stratified
according to the magnitude of tumor viability (<25%,
25–49%, 50–75%, and >75% of total tumor surface
area), a significantly higher proportion of patients
treated with bevacizumab had <25% residual viable
tumor cells compared with patients who were not treated with bevacizumab (45% vs 23%; P 5 .02). A complete pathologic response (ie, no identifiable viable
tumor cells in any tumor nodules) was observed in 5
patients (11.6%) treated with 5FU/OX only for a median of 12 cycles (range, 4–15 cycles) and 7 patients
(11.3%) treated with 5FU/OX plus bevacizumab for a
median of 4 cycles (range, 4–12 cycles) (P 5 .59). It is

interesting to note that the mean dimension, measured on macroscopic pathology, of the 26 metastases
found in these 12 patients was 2 cm  0.5 cm (median,
1.9 cm) despite the absence of viable tumor cells.
There were a wide range of tumor sizes resected in
both groups (median, 2 cm [range, 0.5–12 cm] in the
bevacizumab group, and 3.5 cm [range, 1–10 cm] in
the 5FU/OX group). To investigate whether resected
tumor dimension might be associated with the degree
of pathologic response, patients were stratified according to tumor dimension as measured on macroscopic
pathology for the following subgroups: 2 cm, 3 cm,
4 cm, and >4 cm (the number of patients compared
in each stratum were 40, 47, 54, and 8, respectively, in
the bevacizumab group and 16, 21, 28, and 15, respectively, in the 5FU/OX group) (Fig. 2B).
Treatment with bevacizumab was associated
with significantly reduced percentages of residual
viable tumor cells in each subgroup (2 cm: 24.6%
 3.7 [median, 20%] vs 45.6%  6.6 [median, 50%] [P
5 .01]; 3 cm: 25.9%  3.7 [median, 20%] vs 46.2%
 5.2 [median, 50%] [P 5 .003]; and 4 cm: 29.5%
 3.5 [median, 30%] vs 45.4%  5.1 [median, 50%] [P

cm, no difference was found between patients treated with and those treated without bevacizumab
with regard to tumor viability (58.5%  10.7 [median,
70%] vs 45.3  5.3 [median, 50%]; P 5 .09).
Overall, treatment duration was similar between
the groups treated with and those treated without
bevacizumab. To clarify the effect of the duration of
chemotherapy on pathologic response, patients were
stratified according to the number of cycles of 5FU/
OX received (2–4 [42 patients], 5–8 43 patients]; and
>8 [20 patients]). The distribution of patients across

these subgroups was similar between the 2 treatment
groups (5FU/OX with or without bevacizumab).
Patients treated without bevacizumab had greater
percentages of residual viable tumor cells than those
treated with bevacizumab regardless of the duration
of treatment (2–4 cycles: 50%  5.3 [median, 50%] vs
35.5%  6.2 [median, 30%]; 5–8 cycles: 46.2%  5.9

[median, 5%], respectively) (differences did not reach
statistical significance in these subgroup analyses).

Incidence of Sinusoidal Dilation
Pathologic review of the nontumorous liver parenchyma revealed that the incidence of sinusoidal dilation of any grade was significantly higher in patients
treated without bevacizumab (23 of 43 patients;
53.5%) than in those treated with bevacizumab (17 of
62 patients; 27.4%) (P 5 .006) (Fig. 3A). The incidence
of moderate or severe sinusoidal dilation was also
significantly higher in patients treated without bevacizumab (12 of 43 patients; 27.9%) than in those
treated with bevacizumab (5 of 62 patients; 8.1%)
(P 5 .006) (Fig. 3B). These differences were independent of the duration of chemotherapy. The
median number of cycles of 5FU/OX was similar in
patients who developed any grade of sinusoidal dilation (6 cycles; range, 2–16 cycles) and those who did
not (6 cycles; range, 2–15 cycles) and in those who
developed moderate to severe sinusoidal dilation (6.5
cycles; range, 2–13 cycles) and those who did not (6
cycles; range, 2–16 cycles) (both P > .05).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that 5FU/OX plus bevacizumab was oncologically more effective than 5FU/OX
alone as demonstrated by the greater pathologic
responses assessed in resected tumors. We also
found that the incidences and severity of hepatic
injury were reduced when bevacizumab was added
to 5FU/OX. These findings provide additional evidence supporting the use of bevacizumab for CLM.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze
the pathologic effect of preoperative chemotherapy
with 5FU/OX plus bevacizumab on resected CLM and
nontumorous liver. Previous studies have examined
the efficacy of bevacizumab added to cytotoxic therapy using clinical outcome measures,14,15 but analysis
of pathologic changes that occur in tumors after treatment with biologic agents is lacking.
Our decision to evaluate tumor response pathologically was motivated by recent reports that suggest
that radiologic assessment of changes in tumor size
may not accurately reflect response to chemotherapy8 and may either overestimate20 or underestimate
the actual extent of tumor regression.18 (Fig. 4) Two
studies focused on targeted biologic therapies have
further emphasized these limitations21 and demonstrated that in some disease types changes in tumor
size in response to biologic therapies underestimate
the actual pathologic tumor response.22 One possible
explanation is that radiologic methods cannot fully
differentiate between areas of viable tumor and areas
of fibrotic replacement induced by effective chemotherapy. (Fig. 4)
A recent study by Rubbia-Brandt et al.9 provides
new insights into the pathologic changes induced by
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and provides a framework within which the findings of the current
study can be analyzed. The findings of that study
demonstrated that, compared with tumors not treated with preoperative chemotherapy, tumors treated
with preoperative oxaliplatin exhibit significant tumor regression with marked reduction or disappearance of viable tumor cells and fibrosis overgrowth.18
In the current study, we confirmed the finding of
Rubbia-Brandt et al. that tumor response to chemotherapy is characterized, in part, by replacement of
tumor with fibrosis (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we found
not only that a similar pathologic change occurs in
tumors treated with 5FU/OX plus bevacizumab, but
the addition of bevacizumab to 5FU/OX yielded an
incrementally greater decrease in residual viable cells
within the resected tumors over the decrease associated with 5FU/OX alone. It is interesting to note
that this differentially greater pathologic response
with bevacizumab was significant in tumors mea-

suring 4 cm and was independent of the duration
of chemotherapy. The absence of improved response
in tumors measuring >4 cm may be related to the
inadequate sample size to detect the difference, or to
the lesser effectiveness associated with bevacizumab
for this subset. These data also suggest that the
improved tumor regression with bevacizumab occurs
early during treatment and that a fairly stable benefit
is sustained with increasing duration of treatment.
Increased pathologic response to preoperative
treatment is associated with improved long-term outcome in several malignancies, such as esophageal
cancer and colorectal cancer.19,23 A similar survival

advantage has been recently reported in patients
with CLM treated with 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, or
irinotecan.9 However, whether the degree of improved pathologic response associated with bevacizumab for CLM translates into improved long-term
outcome remains to be evaluated by further study.
The second major finding of this study was that
bevacizumab reduced the incidence and severity of
oxaliplatin-related sinusoidal dilation. Oxaliplatinbased chemotherapy has been shown to cause hepatic sinusoidal dilation,4,12,18 a vascular injury characteristic of veno-occlusive disease,24 recently
renamed sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS).25
SOS is a complication of conditioning chemotherapy
before bone marrow transplantation in 5% to 54% of
patients.26–28 Although to our knowledge the pathophysiology of drug-induced SOS is not fully understood, in vitro and in vivo models suggest that
oxaliplatin induces an overproduction of reactive oxygen species and depletion of glutathione in endothelial cells,29,30 which plays a pivotal role in SOS
development.31 DeLeve et al.32 have also demonstrated that sinusoidal endothelial cell release of
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 precipitates the early steps of SOS by degrading the extracellular matrix in the spaces of Disse and endothelial
cell degradation and embolization. VEGF is known to
regulate MMP-9 activation by inducing its expression. In patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, the serum VEGF level is found to be elevated
in individuals who develop SOS, and the degree of
the increase in VEGF serum level parallels the clinical severity of SOS.33 Therefore, although the
mechanisms that explain a bevacizumab-mediated
decrease in the hepatic toxicity of oxaliplatin remain
unknown, VEGF blockade may attenuate sinusoidal
injury by down-regulating MMP-9 production.
The clinical relevance of sinusoidal dilation with
respect to outcomes after hepatic resection is increasingly recognized. We reported no increase in morbidity
after a median of 12 weeks of treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy,4 but 2 recent studies have
described an increase in blood transfusions and complications in patients treated preoperatively for >12
weeks.11,12 In rare cases, prolonged treatment of CLM
with oxaliplatin has been associated with SOS and
death.13 Although our study cannot clarify whether
bevacizumab protects from long-term exposure to
oxaliplatin, the protective effect of bevacizumab
observed in the current study is attractive.
Although this study is limited by its retrospective
nature, the increase in the magnitude of pathologic
response after treatment with bevacizumab and the
reduction in the incidence and severity of sinusoidal

dilation strongly suggest a benefit for the use of bevacizumab-containing regimens over oxaliplatin alone.
Further studies are needed to expand on these initial
findings and to provide further insight into the role
of bevacizumab as a potentially protective agent
against the broader spectrum of diseases associated
with SOS.
