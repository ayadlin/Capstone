Abstract
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), including crizotinib, are effective
treatments in preclinical models and in cancer patients with ALK-translocated cancers. However, their efficacy
will ultimately be limited by the development of acquired drug resistance. Here we report two mechanisms of
ALK TKI resistance identified from a crizotinib-treated non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient and in a cell
line generated from the resistant tumor (DFCI076) as well as from studying a resistant version of the ALK TKI
(TAE684)–sensitive H3122 cell line. The crizotinib-resistant DFCI076 cell line harbored a unique L1152R ALK
secondary mutation and was also resistant to the structurally unrelated ALK TKI TAE684. Although the DFCI076
cell line was still partially dependent on ALK for survival, it also contained concurrent coactivation of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. In contrast, the TAE684-resistant (TR3) H3122 cell line did not contain
an ALK secondary mutation but instead harbored coactivation of EGFR signaling. Dual inhibition of both ALK
and EGFR was the most effective therapeutic strategy for the DFCI076 and H3122 TR3 cell lines. We further
identified a subset (3/50; 6%) of treatment naive NSCLC patients with ALK rearrangements that also had
concurrent EGFR activating mutations. Our studies identify resistance mechanisms to ALK TKIs mediated by
both ALK and by a bypass signaling pathway mediated by EGFR. These mechanisms can occur independently, or
in the same cancer, suggesting that the combination of both ALK and EGFR inhibitors may represent an effective
therapy for these subsets of NSCLC patients. Cancer Res; 71(18); 6051–60. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The emerging impact of targeted therapies as cancer treatments has led to a therapeutic paradigm shift in the field of
oncology. Several kinase inhibitors have been identified as
effective clinical therapies for a broad range of cancers and,
specifically, in those in which the target of the kinase inhibitor
has undergone a gain of function genomic alteration (1, 2).
However, the clinical success of treatment with kinase inhi-

bitors is uniformly limited by the development of acquired
drug resistance. Two common mechanisms of acquired drug
resistance have been identified. These include secondary
mutations in the target of the kinase itself, which abrogate
the inhibitory activity of the drug, and activation of alternative
signaling pathways that bypass the continued requirement for
inhibition of the original target (3–5). The understanding of
the mechanistic bases for drug resistance will continue to
inform the development of strategies to overcome or prevent
clinical drug resistance, thereby providing a greater therapeutic benefit for cancer patients (6, 7).
Chromosomal rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (ALK) gene have been detected in anaplastic large cell
lymphoma (ALCL), inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor
(IMT), and in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; refs. 8–
10). In NSCLC, ALK rearrangements have been detected in 3%
to 13% of patients, are more common in never-smokers and in
those with adenocarcinoma (11). In addition, they are often
mutually exclusive with other oncogenic alterations detected
in NSCLC, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
mutations. ALK kinase inhibitors are effective therapies in
both preclinical in vitro and in vivo models and in NSCLC
patients harboring ALK rearrangements (2, 12, 13). In the
phase I clinical trial of crizotinib, a radiographic tumor

response rate of 55% was observed in ALK rearranged NSCLC
patients (2). This agent is currently in phase III clinical
development in this genomically defined patient population.
Recent studies have also identified and studied crizotinib
resistance mechanisms. To date 3 secondary mutations, all
identified from crizotinib-treated NSCLC or IMT patients,
have been reported (14, 15). These mutations either involve
the "gatekeeper" residue (L1196) or sites away from crizotinib
binding (F1174L and C1156Y; refs. 14, 15). The mechanistic
basis for how the different mutations lead to crizotinib
resistance is not fully understood. The L1196 mutation may
create a steric hindrance for crizotinib binding, whereas the
F1174L mutation likely promotes the active conformation of
ALK, thus disfavoring crizotinib binding which preferentially
binds the inactive conformation of ALK (14). Continued
studies of these and other resistance mechanisms will be
critical to the design of subsequent treatments for NSCLC
patients with ALK rearrangements.
In this study, using cell line models of ALK inhibitor
resistance, either derived from a crizotinib-resistant patient
or generated in vitro, we uncover additional mechanisms of
ALK kinase inhibitor resistance. Our findings underscore the
complexity of drug resistance mechanisms and the therapeutic challenges of treating multiple concurrent resistance
mechanisms.

Materials and Methods
Patients
Patients were either identified from the Thoracic Oncology
Program at DFCI (n ¼ 3) or were treated in a clinical trial
(NCT00932893) with crizotinib that was sponsored by Pfizer,
Inc (n ¼ 1). Tumor biopsies were obtained under an Institutional Review Board approved protocol. All patients provided
written informed consent.
ALK and EGFR genomic analyses
The ALK kinase domain was sequenced from all of the
available specimens. The PCR primers and conditions are
available upon request. ALK FISH was carried out using the
break apart probe (Vysis LSI ALK Dual Color; Abbott Molecular) as previously described (14, 16). EGFR mutation detection was done in a CLIA certified laboratory using previously
described methods (17).
Cell lines and expression constructs
The NSCLC cell lines H3122 (EML4-ALK variant 1 E13;A20)
and DFCI-032 (EML4-ALK variant 1 E13:A20), A549, HCC827
(EGFR del E746_A750) have been previously published (13).
The H3122 cells were obtained from the NIH and confirmed by
fingerprinting using the Power Plex 1.2 system (Promega) in
October 2010. The DFCI076 (EML4-ALK variant 3 (E6;A20) cell
was established at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from pleural
effusion from a patient who had developed acquired resistance to crizotinib. The DFCI076 cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/mL
penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 1 mmol/L sodium
pyruvate (RPMI 10% medium).

Cancer Res; 71(18) September 15, 2011

The EML4-ALK (Variant 1) cDNA from the H3122 cell line
and the EGFR-del (EGFR delE746_A750) cDNA were cloned
into pDNR-Dual (BD Biosciences) as described previously (14).
To generate EML4-ALK mutants, L1152R, L1196M, C1156Y, or
F1174L mutations were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent) with mutant specific primers according to
the manufacturer's instructions and as previously described
(14). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Retroviral infection and culture of Ba/F3 cell were done using
previously described methods (18). Polyclonal cell lines were
established by puromycin selection and subsequently cultured
in the absence of interleukin-3 (IL-3). Uninfected Ba/F3 cells
or cell lines expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were
used as controls
Cell proliferation and growth assays
Crizotinib and the pan-ERBB inhibitor PF299804 were
provided by Pfizer. TAE684 and BMS-536,924 were synthesized
as previously described (19, 20). Recombinant human EGF
(PHG0314) was purchased from Invitrogen. Growth and
inhibition of growth was assessed by MTS assay according
to previously established methods (18). All experimental
points were set up in 6 to 12 wells and all experiments were
repeated at least 3 times. For clonogenic assays, cells were
plated in triplicate on the 6-well plates and subject to drug
exposure for 14 days, the colonies were fixed and stained with
0.5% crystal violet in 25% methanol, and the numbers of
colonies were counted.
ALK and EGFR shRNA constructs and lentiviral
infection
ALK and EGFR short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs
cloned into the pLKO.1 puro vector as previously described
(21). A vector containing a nontargeting (NT) shRNA and GFP
shRNA was used as a control. Lentivirus production, titrations,
and infections were done as in ref. 21. The specific shRNA
sequences are available upon request.
Generation of in vitro drug-resistant H3122 cells
To generate drug-resistant cells, the H3122 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of TAE684, similar to our
previously described methods (3, 21). TAE684 concentrations
were increased stepwise from 1 to 100 nmol/L when the cells
resumed growth kinetics, similar to untreated parental cells. To
confirm the emergence of a resistant clone, MTS assays were
done following growth at each concentration. The in vitro drugresistant cells were subcloned by single-cell isolation.
Antibodies and Western blotting
Cell lysis, Western blotting, and immunoblotting was done
as previously described (18). Anti-ALK (DF53), anti–phosphoEGFR, anti–total-EGFR, anti-EGFR L858R, anti-EGFR
delE746_A750, anti-PARP, anti–atubulin, anti–phosphoAkt (Ser-473), and anti–total-Akt, were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology. Total ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2
(pT185/pY187) antibodies were from Invitrogen. Immunoprecipitations were done using anti–Flag-M2 agarose (SigmaAldrich Co.). The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array was

are shown in green. Note that L1152 and C1156 are not in contact with the ATP-binding cleft but are adjacent to each other and to the C-helix (pink).
Both the L1152R and C1156Y mutations could introduce hydrogen bond interactions with E1161 on the C-helix. All of the resistance mutations identified
to date cluster around the conformationally sensitive C-helix and activation loop, suggesting that they may affect kinase activity and inhibitor binding
through alterations in the structure or stability of these elements. The activation loop (A-loop, colored orange) is partially disordered in this structure as
denoted by the dashed line. Figure is drawn from PDB ID 2XP2.

purchased from R&D Systems and used according to the
manufacturer's recommended conditions. ALK immunohistochemistry (IHC) was done using the mouse monoclonal
anti-human ALK (clone: 5A4; Abcam) as previously described
(16). EGFR IHC was done as previously described (22).
Phosphotyrosine profiling
Phosphotyrosine profiling was done using a bead based
assay using previously described methods (23). Parental and
drug-resistant cells were treated with either vehicle or drug for
6 hours followed by cell lysis prior to analysis.

Cell-cycle analysis and apoptosis assays
A total of 1  106 cells treated with each of the compound at
indicated concentration or dimethyl sulfoxide were washed in
PBS, fixed in 70% ethanol, incubated with RNAse in PBS, and
resuspended in 500 mL propidium iodide. The percentage of
cells in G1, S-phase, and G2-M phases were analyzed by flow
cytometry. Apoptosis was analyzed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay using the APO-BRDU Kit (BD Biosciences) according to
the manufacturer's instructions.

Results
Detection of EGFR ligands
EGF, amphiregulin, TGF-a, HB-EGF, and epiregulin were
measured in cell culture medium using an ELISA, were done
according to the manufacturer's recommended procedures
(Quantikine; R&D Systems) and as described previously (24).
All samples were run in triplicate. Color intensity was
measured at 450 nm using a spectrophotometric plate reader.
Growth factor concentrations were determined by comparison with standard curves.

The novel somatic ALK L1152R mutation results in drug
resistance to ALK inhibitors
To identify additional mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib, we first studied a NSCLC patient with an ALK rearrangement [EML4-ALK variant 3 (E6;A20)] who had developed
clinical acquired resistance to crizotinib, following a brief
radiographic response after 3 months of treatment. Sequencing of the ALK gene from the clinically progressing tumor

(pleural effusion) revealed the presence of a novel mutation
(Fig. 1A). This mutation resulted in a change from a leucine to
an arginine at position 1152 (L1152R). The recurrent tumor
was wild-type for EGFR and KRAS (data not shown). This
mutation was not detected in the tumor of the patient
obtained prior to crizotinib treatment (data not shown).
We evaluated the biological impact of the L1152R mutation
by introducing it into EML4-ALK and generating Ba/F3 cells.
Both EML4-ALK and EML4-ALK L1152R led to IL-3 independent
growth of Ba/F3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The EML4ALK L1152R cells were significantly more resistant than the
parental cells to both crizotinib (Fig. 1B) and ALK inhibitor
TAE684 (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The L1152R mutation diminished crizotinib-mediated inhibition of downstream AKT
and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Consistent with these findings on growth, greater concentrations of
crizotinib were required to inhibit ALK phosphorylation in the
EML4-ALK L1152R cells compared with those with EML4-ALK
alone (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, to compare the impact of resistance in endogenous EML4-ALK NSCLC cells, the L1152R and
previously identified resistance mutations (C1156Y, L1196M,
and F1174L) were stably expressed in H3122 cells and the cells
were examined for crizotinib resistance (14, 15). All of the
resistance mutations, C1156Y, L1196M, L1152R, and F1174L,
resulted in the significant elevation of IC50 compared with the
control cells (GFP or EML4-ALK wild-type), but there were no
significant difference among the C1156Y, L1196M, and L1152R
mutations (Supplementary Fig. S1D and Table 1). Analogous to
the known resistance mutation C1152Y, examination of the
published crystal structure of ALK in an inactive conformation
reveals that the L1152R mutation is not in direct contact with
the ATP-binding pocket, where both crizotinib and TAE684 are
expected to bind (Fig. 1D, ref. 25). The currently available
structures do not reveal a clear mechanistic basis as to how
L1152R may mediate ALK inhibitor resistance.

mutation. Similar to the Ba/F3 cells harboring the L1152R
mutation, the DFCI076 cells were resistant to both crizotinib
and TAE684 (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2A). However,
these cells were still dependent on ALK for their growth as
downregulation of ALK using an ALK-specific shRNA resulted
in significant growth inhibition compared with either a NT- or
an EGFR-specific shRNA (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Fig. S2B and
C). Similarly, the ALK shRNA, but not the EGFR shRNA, was
effective in the crizotinib and TAE684-sensitive H3122 cell line
(Fig. 2B). However, the degree of growth inhibition by the ALK
shRNA was not as dramatic in the DFCI076 cells compared
with the H3122 cells. This prompted us to evaluate whether
the DFCI076 cells might contain other concurrent resistance
mechanisms. We assessed the activation status of multiple
RTKs using the human phospho-RTK arrays as in our prior
study (3). Using this approach, we observed strong EGFR and
MET phosphorylation in the DFCI076 cells (Fig. 2C). The
DFCI076 cells did not contain an EGFR mutation or an EGFR
amplification (data not shown) but secreted the EGFR ligand
amphiregulin (Supplementary Fig. S2D). Although crizotinib is
a potent MET inhibitor and successfully inhibited phosphoMET, it does not inhibit EGFR activity and, even at high
concentrations, did not lead to downregulation of pAKT and
pERK1/2 to the extent observed in H3122 cells (Fig. 2D).
Combined inhibition of ALK (using a shRNA) and EGFR, using
the pan-ERBB inhibitor PF299804, was significantly more
effective (P < 0.001) than either strategy alone in the DFCI076
cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, the growth curve of DFCI076 cells
treated with both PF299804 and crizotinib was similar to the
H3122 cells engineered to express the L1152R mutation and
subjected to crizotinib treatment (Fig. 2A). Collectively, these
findings suggest that although the DFCI076 cells remain
largely ALK dependent for their growth, concurrent EGFR
inhibition may provide additive growth inhibition. These
findings are similar to our prior studies of the DFCI032 cell
line generated from a NSCLC patient with EML4-ALK who was
never treated with an ALK inhibitor (13). We further confirmed that the DFCI032 cells were sensitive to the combination of the ALK shRNA and PF299804 (Supplementary Fig. S2E
and F).

ALK inhibitor–resistant H3122 cells contain activation
of EGFR signaling
To identify additional mechanisms of resistance to ALK
kinase inhibitors, we generated a TAE684-resistant version
of the EML4-ALK H3122 NSCLC cell line. We have used a
similar approach to identify known and previously unknown
EGFR kinase inhibitor resistance mechanisms (3, 21). After
6 months of gradually increasing TAE684, we were able to
isolate cells that proliferated in 100 nmol/L of TAE684. In
our prior studies, we showed that 100 nmol/L of TAE684
inhibited ALK signaling and significantly decreased cell
viability in H3122 cells, but this concentration was not
generally toxic in non-ALK rearranged NSCLC cell lines
(13). We subcloned the TAE-resistant (TR) cells from single
cells (H3122 TR3) and these cells were resistant to both
TAE684 and crizotinib (Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig. S3A).
DNA fingerprinting confirmed that the H3122 TR3 cells were
derived from the H3122 parental cells (data not shown). We
sequenced the entire ALK kinase domain from the H3122
TR3 cells and did not detect any secondary ALK mutations
(data not shown). To determine whether the H3122 TR3 cells
were still ALK dependent for their growth, we downregulated ALK using an ALK-specific shRNA (Fig. 3B). However,
unlike the parental H3122 cells, the H3122 TR3 cells were
only minimally growth inhibited by ALK downregulation
(Fig. 3B). We further evaluated the ALK locus using FISH.
Although all of the H3122 cells contained the EML4-ALK
inversion, this was only detected in a small fraction (5%) of
the H3122 TR3 (Supplementary Fig. S3B and C). The cells
that retained the inversion also harbored a concurrent
amplification in the ALK locus (Supplementary Fig. S3C).

Together, these findings suggest that the H3122 TR3 cells
have evolved to lose their ALK dependence for growth.
To further characterize the H3122 TR3 cells, we carried out
phospho-RTK arrays in both the parental and drug-resistant
cells with and without TAE684 treatment (Fig. 3C). Compared
with the parental cells, the H3122 TR cells contained greater
EGFR, IGF1R, and MET phosphorylation and these proteins
remained persistently phosphorylated despite TAE684 treatment (Fig. 3C). We also used a previously described quantitative bead based phospho-tyrosine assay to specifically study
these 3 proteins in further detail (23). Consistent with the
genomic findings, ALK phosphorylation was greater in the
H3122 compared with the H3122 TR3 cells (Fig. 3D). TAE684
still effectively inhibited ALK phosphorylation in both cell
lines. In contrast and consistent with the RTK array, EGFR
phosphorylation was markedly elevated in the H3122 TR3 cells
(Fig. 3D). This was inhibited by the EGFR kinase inhibitor
gefitinib but not TAE684 (Fig. 3D). We also observed phosphorylated ERBB2 and IGF1R in H3122 TR3 clone using this
assay (Supplementary Fig. S3D). Of note, the ectopic expression of ALK secondary mutations (Supplementary Fig. S1D)
did not lead to an increase in EGFR expression in the H3122
cells (data not shown).
Next, we examined whether activated EGFR had a functional role in the H3122 TR3 cells. We first downregulated
EGFR using 2 different (A3 and D) EGFR shRNAs. Compared
with a control shRNA, EGFR knockdown led to significant
(P < 0.05) decrease in cell proliferation by day 6 in the
H3122 TR3 but not the parental cell line (Fig. 3E). This
observation was mirrored in a colony formation assay in
which treatment with PF299804 resulted in a significant

the pan-ERBB inhibitor PF299804 and crizotinib was most
effective in the H3122 TR3 cells leading to complete inhibition of colony formation. However, the effects of PF299804
and crizotinib were mostly cytostatic as judged by only
minimal changes in cleaved PARP and by using a TUNEL
assay (Fig. 3G and Supplementary Fig. S3E). There was no

We further determined how EGFR was activated in the
H3122 TR3 cells. We did not identify evidence of an EGFR
mutation or amplification as detected by FISH (data not
shown). However, the supernatant of the H3122 TR3 cells
contained significantly (P < 0.05) greater amounts of known
EGFR ligands including amphiregulin and EGF (Supplementary
Fig. S3G), suggesting that the mechanism of EGFR activation in
these cells is through a ligand-mediated autocrine activation.

Activation of EGFR signaling induces resistance to
crizotinib
Our studies from the ALK inhibitor–resistant DFCI032,
DFCI 076, and H3122 TR3 cells suggest a role for EGFR
signaling in mediating crizotinib resistance. To formally evaluate this hypothesis, we activated EGFR signaling in H3122
cells using EGFR ligands and by oncogenic forms of EGFR and
determined the effects on crizotinib sensitivity. We observed
that exogenous EGF was indeed sufficient to promote resistance to ALK inhibition, and resistance could be reversed
using a combination of ALK and EGFR inhibitors (Fig. 4A). In
the presence of EGF, crizotinib was still able to inhibit ALK
phosphorylation but not AKT, S6, and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Similarly, introduction of EGFR E746_A750 into
H3122 cells promoted crizotinib resistance (Fig. 4C) which is

reversed by the concurrent administration of the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib or PF299804 (Fig. 4D and Supplementary
Fig. S4A). Analogously EML4-ALK promotes gefitinib resistance in the HCC827 EGFR mutant NSCLC cell line (Supplementary Fig. S4B), which was reversed by concurrent
treatment with TAE684 (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
A subset of EML4-ALK NSCLC patients harbor
concurrent EGFR mutations
Our in vitro studies suggest that EGFR signaling can contribute to ALK kinase inhibitor resistance in EML4-ALK
NSCLC. In addition, we show that a cancer cell line that
harbors a concurrent ALK rearrangement and an EGFR
mutation would be expected to be resistant to both singleagent ALK and EGFR inhibitors. Acquired drug resistance

mechanisms can sometimes also occur de novo and both EGFR
T790M and MET amplification have been described in cancers
from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) naive patients (26).
In our prior study, we identified one treatment naive NSCLC
patient that harbored a concurrent EGFR mutation and EML4ALK (13). However, this tumor was obtained from a patient
that had undergone surgery and thus never received systemic
therapy. Subsequently, in 50 crizotinib treatment naive NSCLC
patients harboring ALK rearrangements at DFCI, all detected
in a clinical laboratory, we have now identified 3 (6%) patients
that also harbor concurrent EGFR mutations (Table 2). Two of
the three patients have undergone therapy with erlotinib and
both have achieved partial responses (Table 2). Evaluation of
the pretreatment tumor from patient 1 using the EGFR
L858R–specific antibody shows EGFR staining (Fig 4E), whereas no staining was observed with the ALK-specific antibody
(Fig 4E) despite the presence of the ALK genomic rearrangement (Table 2).

Discussion
ALK TKIs are emerging as effective clinical therapies for
cancers containing genetic rearrangements in ALK including
NSCLC, IMT, and ALCL (8, 10, 27). However, the clinical
success of this therapeutic approach is uniformly limited by
the development of drug resistance. The mechanistic understanding of drug resistance may help to develop effective
subsequent clinical treatments and/or rational combination
therapeutic strategies.
In this study, by studying patient-derived tumors and cell
lines, we uncover novel ALK TKI resistance mechanisms.
These include both a secondary mutation (L1152R) in ALK
and activation of EGFR signaling. Importantly, these can occur
together in the same tumor (i.e., the DFCI 076 cell line)
highlighting both the complexity of drug resistance mechanisms and the therapeutic challenges in developing strategies
to overcome clinical drug resistance.
Secondary mutations in kinases are a common mechanism
of drug resistance to kinase inhibitors (4, 5, 28, 29). A few
distinct categories of mutations have so far been identified.
These include secondary mutations that alter drug contact
residues, thus creating a steric hindrance for drug binding
(30). Alternatively, secondary mutations can promote conformational changes in the kinase and thus disfavoring the
binding of a kinase inhibitor (30). The L1152R mutation is
not located in the kinase domain. The currently available

6058

Cancer Res; 71(18) September 15, 2011

crystal structures of ALK do not provide a clear explanation of
the mechanistic basis of drug resistance imparted by this
mutation. Furthermore, despite different EML4-ALK variants
that have been described to date, there is no evidence to
suggest that the mechanisms of acquired resistance will vary
on the basis of specific EML4-ALK variant (11). Notably the
L1152R mutation, unlike the F1174L mutation, is also resistant
to TAE684 (14). Thus structurally distinct ALK inhibitors are
needed to overcome this mutation and several are under
preclinical development. Additional studies, including solving
the crystal structure for the ALK L1152R, will be necessary to
obtain further insight into how this mutation causes drug
resistance.
Prior studies have generated crizotinib-resistant H3122
cells and detected both evidence of an ALK amplification
and the presence of the L1196M gatekeeper mutation (31).
We also identify ALK amplification in a subset of the H3122
TR3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B) but not the L1196M
mutation. Because TAE684, unlike crizotinib, can effectively
inhibit the growth of H3122 EML4-ALK L1196M cells, our
findings are consistent with the prior studies (31). In fact,
they suggest that a more potent ALK inhibitor may be able to
prevent the emergence of this specific drug resistance
mechanism. Whether this will ultimately translate into a
clinical benefit (such as a prolongation if progression-free
survival) for NSCLC patients can only be determined from
clinical trials.
Our studies identify activation of EGFR signaling as a
bypass signaling mechanisms that contributes to ALK inhibitor resistance. Concurrent inhibition of both EGFR and ALK
is therapeutically effective in all of the resistant models.
Intriguingly, different models have differing degrees of apparent EGFR dependence. The DFCI076 cells are mostly ALK
dependent (Fig. 2B), whereas the H3122 TR3 cells are more
EGFR dependent (Fig. 3D) for their growth. The DFCI032 cells
are equally codependent with very little effect on growth by
only EGFR or ALK inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S2F and ref.
13). These different examples may be representative of a
dynamic process with variable degrees of adaptation to EGFR
signaling in the presence of ALK inhibition. However, we
cannot completely exclude the possibility that activation of
EGFR signaling in these cell lines did not arise in the process of
generating the cell lines. Additional evaluation of tumor
specimens for changes in EGFR phosphorylation obtained
from patients that have developed crizotinib resistance will
be necessary. Further investigation is also needed to study

Resistance Mechanisms in ALK Kinase Inhibitors

changes in EGFR signaling over time to further understand
how this adaptive process evolves. Furthermore, whether the
process will revert in the absence of ALK inhibition needs to be
determined. Such observation may be clinically significant as
it would suggest that drug-resistant cancers could regain their
sensitivity following a therapeutic holiday from ALK inhibitors. To date we have grown the H3122 TR3 cells 60 passages
in the absence of TAE684 and have not observed a reversion to
TAE684 sensitivity (data not shown).
It is noteworthy that both in vitro and in NSCLC patients,
activated EGFR signaling occurs concurrently with EML4-ALK.
Such cancers could still retain sensitivity to single-agent EGFR
or ALK inhibitors if the tumor was heterogenous and contained 2 independent populations: one with EML4-ALK and
one with an EGFR mutation. Alternatively, a tumor could
contain both genetic alterations but only expressed one of the
mutant proteins. In both instances, such patients may achieve
a transient partial response following therapy with either
single agent. Our limited studies of crizotinib naive NSCLC
patients, with both genetically confirmed EML4-ALK and
EGFR mutations, suggest that ALK is not expressed as both
patients treated with erlotinib achieved a clinical response. In
contrast, the in vitro studies would predict that coexpression
of EML4-ALK and mutant EGFR in the same cells would lead
to resistance to both single-agent ALK and EGFR inhibitors.
Why some cancers harbor an ALK rearrangement which does
not lead to ALK expression remains to be determined. It will
also be of interest to determine whether the mechanism
of erlotinib resistance in our patients, with both an EGFR

mutation and ALK rearrangement, will involve reactivation of
ALK expression.
Currently there is an ongoing phase I clinical trial of
crizotinib and PF299804 (NCT01121575) originally designed
to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of inhibiting MET (crizotinib is a potent MET inhibitor) and EGFR T790M in erlotinibresistant EGFR mutant NSCLC patients. However, our studies
suggest that combination of crizotinib and PF299804 may
represent a rational therapeutic strategy for at least a subset of
EML4-ALK NSCLC patients that develop acquired crizotinib
resistance.
