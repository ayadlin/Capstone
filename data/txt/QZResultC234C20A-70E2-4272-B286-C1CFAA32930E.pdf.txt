Abstract
Inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and
Crohn’s disease, substantially increases the risk of colorectal
cancer. However, mechanisms linking mucosal inflammation
to the sequence of dysplasia are incompletely understood.
Whereas studies have shown oxidative damage to the colon,
this study tests whether genotoxicity is elicited systemically
by acute and chronic intestinal inflammation. In this study,
genotoxic endpoints were assessed in peripheral leukocytes
(DNA single- and double-stranded breaks and oxidative DNA
damage) and normochromatic erythrocytes (micronuclei)
during chemical or immune-mediated colitis. During three
consecutive cycles of intestinal inflammation induced by dextran sulfate sodium administration, genotoxicity to peripheral
leukocytes and erythroblasts was detected in both acute and
chronic phases of dextran sulfate sodium–induced inflammation. Reactive oxygen species–mediated oxidative stress and
DNA damage was confirmed with positive 8-oxoguanine and
nitrotyrosine staining in peripheral leukocytes. Levels of DNA
damage generally decreased during remission and increased
during treatment, correlating with clinical symptoms and
systemic inflammatory cytokine levels. In GAi2 / and interleukin-10 / transgenic mice susceptible to immune-mediated
colitis and inflammation-associated adenocarcinoma, similar
levels of peripheral leukocyte and erythroblast genotoxicity
were also observed. Moreover, this systemic genotoxicity was
observed in mice with subclinical inflammation, which was
further elevated in those with severe mucosal inflammation.
We propose that mucosal inflammation, by eliciting substantial and ongoing systemic DNA damage, contributes early on
to genetic instability necessary for progression to inflammatory bowel disease–associated dysplasia and the development
of cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(11):4827–34]

Introduction
As many as 1.4 million people in the United States and 2.2
million people in Europe currently suffer from inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, and
the incidence is continuously increasing across the modernizing
world (1). Patients afflicted with these diseases also carry an
increased risk for development of colorectal cancer most notably
due to the cumulative effects of chronic colonic inflammation (2).
In addition to colorectal cancer, hepatobiliary carcinoma and

hematopoietic cancers, such as colonic lymphoma, are observed in
some patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis (3).
A variety of mouse models of chronic colitis have been developed
to study the host genetic traits and environmental factors (resident
enteric microbiota or mucosal metabolic stressors), many of which
show the association of chronic intestinal inflammation with
colonic adenocarcinoma as in human IBD. Perhaps most studied
are genetic traits that augment inflammation by impairing metabolic stress mechanisms (4, 5), the mucin barrier (6), innate immune signaling (7), or immune regulation (8–11). These foregoing
studies reflect the interplay of such host factors with a cancerpromoting role of resident enteric bacteria, and this interaction
has been confirmed by interventional studies (12–15). However, the
mechanisms linking metabolic stress, inflammation, and cancer
remain incompletely understood.
In addition to genetic models of chronic colitis, an important
experimental model of colitis and colitis-associated neoplasia is
administration of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS), a nongenotoxic
sulfated polysaccharide (16, 17). Acute and chronic colonic
inflammation can be induced eventually leading to dysplasia
followed by colorectal cancer. Penetrance correlates to duration of
inflammation produced either by recurrent administration alone
(17, 18) or by brief exposure in mice with genetic traits that amplify
and perpetuate colitis (6, 7, 11). DSS-induced colitis has been
attributed to direct metabolic epithelial toxicity, augmented by
mucosal intrusion of enteric microbiota and their products, with
resultant inflammation predominantly driven by innate rather than
adaptive immune cell types (6, 12, 16, 19).
Several studies have addressed potential carcinogenesis-promoting mechanisms in colitis, including repair and regeneration of the
epithelial barrier, the innate immune response, role of cytokines,
and oxidative DNA damage at the local sites of inflammation in the
colon (19–22). However, we are unaware of studies that have
determined whether intestinal inflammation affects the level of
systemic genotoxicity, such as in the peripheral blood. Accordingly,
this study was developed to characterize and quantify the
association of systemic DNA damage in acute and chronic colitis
by both DSS administration and in models of spontaneous chronic
immune colitis.

Materials and Methods
Animals. C57BL/6Jpun/pun (3-4 months), Gai2 / (B6/129Sv background;
3 months; ref. 9), and interleukin (IL)-10 / (C3H/HeJBir background; 3 or
6 months) were housed in the University of California at Los Angeles
Department of Laboratory and Animal Medicine under specific pathogenfree conditions, autoclaved bedding and food, with standard rodent chow
diet, acidified drinking water, and 12:12 h light/dark cycle. All mice were bred
at University of California at Los Angeles, except IL-10 / and C3H/HeJ,
which were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.
Induction of chemical colitis. Experimental colitis was induced with
3% (w/v) DSS (Fisher Scientific; MW 40,000) dissolved in acidified drinking

water (changed daily) ad libitum for three cycles. One cycle consisted of
7 days of treated water followed by 14 days of normal drinking water. Acute
colitis was defined as a 7-day treatment, and chronic colitis was defined as
any further treatment including remission periods. Control animals received sterile acidified water only. Symptoms (weight loss, stool consistency,
and gross bleeding) were recorded daily for calculation of disease activity
index (23).
Blood collection. Peripheral blood was collected from experimental
mice via the facial/mandibular vein with a 5 mm lancet (Braintree
Scientific) into EDTA-coated collection tubes (Braintree Scientific). For the
comet assay, blood was immediately diluted 1:1 in PBS/10% DMSO and
frozen at -80jC until further analysis. Freshly collected blood was
immediately processed for all other assays. Identical blood samples were
used for genotoxic endpoints as well as for cytokine expression.
Alkaline comet assay. To detect single- and double-stranded breaks as
well as alkali-labile sites in DNA, the alkaline comet assay was done as
described previously (24). Frozen blood was further diluted 1:15 in PBS
before further preparation. After lysis and electrophoresis, gels were stained
with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes) and visualized under a fluorescent
microscope (Olympus Ax70) at 10 magnification. Comet images were
analyzed with the CASP image analysis program.4 The olive tail moment,
which represents both tail length and fraction of DNA in the tail, was used
for data collection and analysis, in which apoptotic cells were excluded
under previously proposed criteria (24).
Determination of oxidative DNA damage. The enzyme hOgg1modified comet assay was used for determination of oxidative DNA
damage (25). Following lysis, samples were washed in an enzyme wash
buffer [40 mmol/L HEPES, 0.1 mol/L KCl, 0.5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.2 mg/mL
bovine serum albumin (pH 8.0)] and then incubated at 37jC for 10 min in
either control (buffer with no hOGG1) or enzyme-treated (buffer with
hOGG1) solutions according to the manufacturer’s recommendations
(New England Biolabs). Both control and enzyme treated gels were then
placed in electrophoresis buffer and processed identically to the alkaline
comet assay.
Immunofluorescence. Peripheral blood was incubated in Buffer EL
(Qiagen) on ice to remove erythrocytes. Samples were then processed on
coverslips essentially as described elsewhere (26). Briefly, after fixation,
permeabilization, and blocking, cells were incubated with mouse antiphospho–g-H2AX S139(P) at 1:400, mouse anti–8-oxoguanine clone 413.5 at
1:250, or rabbit anti-nitrotyrosine at 1:200 (all from Upstate) followed by
FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG
(Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:200. Coverslips were mounted with
Vectashield with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories).
Images were captured with CytoVision (Applied Imaging) connected to a
Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope. At least 125 cells were counted and cells with
more than four distinct foci in the nucleus were considered positive for
g-H2AX (26). Apoptotic cells, which are distinguishable due to presence of
10-fold the number of nuclear foci in damaged cells (27), were not included
in analyses.
Paraffin sections (5 Am) of colons from IL-10 / and wild-type controls
were microwaved in 10 mmol/L citrate buffer (pH 6) for 10 min for antigen
retrieval, blocked, and then incubated with anti-8-oxoguanine or antinitrotyrosine followed by secondary antibodies identical to the procedures
described above.
In vivo micronucleus assay. Micronuclei formation was determined in
peripheral blood erythrocytes to assess chromosomal instability. Similar to
a previously proposed method (28), 3 AL whole blood was spread on a
microscope slide and stained in modified Wright-Giemsa solution (SigmaAldrich). Micronuclei were counted and scored with an Olympus Ax70 at
100 following previously proposed criteria (29). At least 4,000 mature
erythrocytes were counted per mouse, and the frequency of micronuclei
formation was calculated as number of micronucleated erythrocytes per
1000 normochromatic erythrocytes.

RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated
using QIAmp RNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Total RNA (25 ng/AL) was used for reverse transcription using
oligo(dT) (Invitrogen) and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).
cDNA (10 ng/AL) was used for quantitative real-time PCR using Taqman
Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) for TATA-binding protein,
tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1
(MCP-1; also known as CC chemokine ligand 2), IFN-g, transforming growth
factor-h, and Taqman Gene Expression Master Mix according to the
manufacturer’s instructions on the ABI Prism 7500 sequence detection
system (Applied Biosystems). TATA-binding protein was chosen as the
endogenous control due to its low variability and low to medium relative
abundance in terms of expression in blood (30). Each measurement was
done in triplicate and results were analyzed using SDS 2.2.1 software
(Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was determined using the relative
standard curve method normalized to TATA-binding protein expression.
Statistical analyses. Results are expressed as mean F SE. Statistical
significance was determined by nonparametric one-way ANOVAs with
Dunn’s multiple comparison post-test or a paired Student’s t tests with logtransformed data for time point comparisons and defined as P < 0.05.
ANOVAs of linear regression models were used as appropriate. Calculations
were done with the statistical analysis software GraphPad Instat version 3.00 (GraphPad Software) or R: a language and environment for statistical computing (31).

Results
Evaluation of experimental colitis. The disease activity index
is the average combined score of weight loss (0-4), stool
consistency (0-4), and bleeding (0-4) used to score clinical
symptoms (23). DSS-treated mice showed rectal bleeding starting
day 4 in cycle 1, represented by the increase in the disease activity
index compared with nontreated animals (Fig. 1). However, the
onset of severe symptoms came earlier in the second and third
cycles of treatment due to chronic inflammation, even after 14-day
remission periods. Bleeding and diarrhea ceased as soon as treatment was stopped during remission and no mortalities were observed after three cycles of treatment. Food intake was also not
affected throughout the study and significant weight loss was only
apparent during the end of the second and third cycle.
DSS treatment causes DNA single- and double-stranded
breaks in peripheral leukocytes. Single- and double-stranded
breaks as well as alkali-labile sites in DNA of peripheral leukocytes
were measured in terms of the mean olive tail moment with the
alkaline comet assay (Fig. 2). Whereas mean olive tail moments
of nontreated mice remained low throughout each cycle of
treatment, DSS-treated mice showed significantly higher olive tail
moments at the end of each cycle (P < 0.01). After each remission
period of 14 days, levels of DNA damage decreased most likely due
to DNA repair. The hOgg1-modified alkaline comet assay was also
used to detect oxidative base damage. Ogg1 primarily recognizes
and removes 8-oxoguanine through a base excision repair pathway
as well as 8-oxoadenine, fapy-guanine, and methyl-fapy-guanine
(32). Mean olive tail moments were higher when incubated with
hOgg1 after treatment cycles in treated mice compared with
hOgg1-incubated nontreated mice (P < 0.05), indicating the
presence of oxidized base damage. When compared with levels
before cycle 1, hOgg1-incubated DNA from DSS-treated mice was
significantly higher at every following time point (P < 0.01; data not
shown). Levels of DNA damage increased with each treatment cycle
especially when including oxidative base damage, indicating
damaging effects of acute and, more significantly, chronic
inflammation. A small number of apoptotic cells with extensive

DNA fragmentation were apparent after treatment cycles but were
not included in calculation of mean olive tail moments.
Presence of DNA double-stranded breaks alone was confirmed
with immunofluorescence of g-H2AX (Fig. 3A). In response to
double-stranded breaks, H2AX is phosphorylated (g-H2AX) in a 2Mbp region flanking the double-stranded break within 15 min (27).
Percentage of cells positive for nuclear foci increased dramatically
in the DSS-treated group after the first 7-day acute treatment
(P < 0.01) compared with nontreated animals. Although not as
dramatic, percent positive cells remained elevated over nontreated
animals until end of treatment (P < 0.05). Efficient DNA doublestranded break repair may be activated, decreasing the presence of
foci in chronic inflammation due to the severely damaging nature
of double-stranded breaks compared with oxidative base damage
or single-stranded breaks.
DSS-induced inflammation is clastogenic to erythroblasts.
The in vivo micronucleus assay was carried out in mature normochromatic erythrocytes circulating in the peripheral blood to
determine chromosomal damage to erythroblasts (Fig. 3B). The
incidence of micronuclei is commonly used as an index of cytogenetic damage, including chromosome breaks, spindle abnormalities, or structurally abnormal chromosomes, most frequently in

erythroblasts/erythrocytes from peripheral blood or bone marrow
(29). Mature micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes represent the final developmental stage of erythroblasts containing
micronuclei stemming in the bone marrow and thus permit the
study of both generation and elimination of micronucleated erythrocytes (33).
Micronucleus formation was significantly induced after the first
cycle of treatment in DSS-treated animals (P < 0.01) compared with
nontreated animals and was further induced after the second and
third cycles compared with both nontreated animals and levels
before cycle 1 (P < 0.01). Similar to patterns seen in the results of
the alkaline comet assay, micronuclei formation decreased after
remission periods and increased after each cycle of treatment.
This indicates clearance of micronucleated erythrocytes by the
spleen followed by induction during treatment periods. Starting
before cycle 3 time point, micronucleated erythrocyte levels were
slightly elevated even in nontreated animals most likely due to
the effects of repeated blood draws and consequentially high rate
of erythropoiesis.
DSS treatment modulates mRNA expression of cytokines in
peripheral blood. Systemic inflammation due to DSS treatment
was shown by cytokine gene expression in the peripheral blood of
treated animals. Leukocytes circulating in the periphery mounted
a strong Th1 response characterized by up-regulation of TNF-a,
MCP-1, and IFN-g particularly after the first cycle of treatment
(Fig. 4). TNF-a transcript levels followed DNA damage patterns of

increasing after each 7-day treatment cycle and then decreasing
after each 14-day remission period. MCP-1 and IFN-g transcript
levels increased after the first cycle and then decreased after the
remission period, where they remained low until increasing once
again in the third cycle, showing a delayed secondary induction
compared with TNF-a. Transforming growth factor-h, an antiinflammatory cytokine, was also modulated similarly to MCP-1 and
IFN-g. DSS treatment induces both a Th1 response and an antiinflammatory response over the acute and chronic phases of
treatment in the peripheral blood.
DNA damage is observed in genetic models of mucosal
inflammation. To further determine whether systemic genotoxicity is a general consequence of colitis, we measured DNA damage
in two genetic models of mucosal inflammation without the use of
DSS. We examined Gai2 / mice at age 3 months (chronic active
inflammation with neoplastic changes in colon) and IL-10 / at
age 3 and 6 months (in which mice have subclinical disease with
minimal histologic inflammation and active disease and inflammation with mild epithelial hyperplasia, respectively; Fig. 5A).
Single and double DNA strand breaks were significantly higher
(P < 0.01) both in Gai2 / mice compared with age-matched
Gai2+/ mice without clinical symptoms and in IL-10 / mice with
subclinical inflammation compared with age-matched IL-10+/+
mice using the comet assay (Fig. 5B). We then hypothesized that
IL-10 / mice with severe mucosal inflammation would have
greater DNA damage than those with subclinical inflammation.
These mice indeed showed higher levels of strand breaks than
IL-10 / mice with subclinical inflammation (P < 0.01) compared
with those seen in Gai2 / mice. Oxidative base damage, however, seemed only apparent in Gai2 mice as measured by hOgg1

incubation. DNA double-stranded breaks measured by g-H2AX
immunofluorescence (Fig. 5C) were also elevated in both Gai2 /
and IL-10 / and Gai2+/ and IL-10+/+ mice, respectively, although
only statistically significant in Gai2 / mice (P < 0.05), and IL10 / mice with severe mucosal inflammation (P < 0.05). Finally,
micronucleus induction in erythroblasts were also significantly
elevated in Gai2 / mice compared with Gai2+/ mice (P < 0.01)
and elevated but not statistically significantly elevated in IL-10 /
versus IL-10+/+ mice (Fig. 5D). Systemic genotoxicity can therefore
be incurred by several modes of inflammation independent of DSS
administration.
Intestinal inflammation induces reactive oxygen species–
mediated oxidative stress and DNA damage. To determine
potentially causative species of oxidative stress due to intestinal
inflammation, peripheral leukocytes from DSS-treated mice (7 days,
3% w/v) and IL-10 / mice (6 months) were isolated and stained
for 8-oxoguanine or nitrotyrosine (Fig. 6A and B). 8-Oxoguanine is
an oxidative DNA lesion formed by reaction of hydroxyl radicals,
metal hydroperoxides, or peroxynitrite with DNA, causing G:C
to T:A transversions during replication (34). Nitrotyrosine is a
biochemical marker for NO-induced peroxynitrite formation
involving reactions with reactive oxygen and nitrogen species resulting in nitrative damage to proteins (35). DSS-induced inflammation caused a significant increase in both 8-oxoguanine and
nitrotyrosine (P < 0.01) in peripheral leukocytes, as did those
isolated from IL-10 / mice (P < 0.05). Colon sections from IL10 / mice also showed 8-oxoguanine residues mostly in the nuclei
of the surface epithelial cells as well as in infiltrating inflammatory
cells within or near the lamina propria as ‘‘focus’’ like or pannuclear staining (Fig. 6C). Nitrotyrosine residues were also present

Discussion
Previous studies have established the role of inflammationderived oxidative DNA damage to inflammatory and surrounding
epithelial cells only at the localized sites of inflammation in the
colon. Our study shows for the first time that this damage extends
beyond the site of inflammation to circulating leukocytes and
erythroblasts in the bone marrow, manifesting a systemic effect,
and correlating to oxidative damage found in inflammatory tissue.

Genotoxicity to peripheral leukocytes was evident in terms of both
single- and double-stranded breaks to DNA accompanied by
oxidative base damage while chromosomal aberrations took place
in erythroblasts. Such findings were observed in both acute and
chronic phases of chemical colitis induced by DSS administration
and untreated Gai2 / and IL-10 / mice undergoing spontaneous immune colitis. Moreover, in IL-10 / mice, which are notable
for a delayed onset of colitis, genotoxicity was further elevated in
mice that had proceeded to a state of clinically active colitis versus
those with subclinical inflammation. Markers of reactive oxygen
species-derived oxidative stress showed presence of 8-oxoguanine
and nitrotyrosine in peripheral leukocytes of DSS-treated mice and

IL-10 / mice, representing possible mechanisms of genotoxicity
and correlating to oxidative damage seen in the colon. Accordingly,
the present study reveals that systemic genotoxicity is a prevalent
feature of subclinical, acute, and chronic colitis.
In DSS-treated mice, repair of DNA damage was observed during
remission periods represented by a decrease in damage markers.
However, the extent of repair appeared slightly less in the last
remission due to increasing severity of chronic inflammation.
Despite increasing severity of inflammation, double-stranded breaks
remained only slightly elevated over nontreated animals, which may
imply efficient repair in comparison with single-stranded breaks and
oxidative damage. DSS administration also induced systemic
distribution of cytokines as evidenced by modulation of transcript
levels in peripheral blood. Interestingly, TNF-a was up-regulated
during treatment and down-regulated during remission, mirroring
patterns seen in genotoxicity to leukocytes. Similar to previous
cytokine studies in the colons of DSS-treated mice (20), features
of both Th1 and Th2 activity were observed systemically in the
peripheral blood, leading to chronic activation of immune cells.
The decrease in MCP-1 and IFN-g expression after the first cycle of
treatment may be explained by a shift toward higher expression of
Th2 cytokines and a decrease in selective Th1 cytokines as recently

documented (36) in DSS-treated mice. Chronic DSS treatment
mimics IBD with similar cytokine profiles showing dysregulated and
imbalanced immunologic responses to commensal bacterial antigens. Dysregulated and polarized cytokine production play key roles
in enhancing chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis through
signaling release of protumor mediators (37).
The present study shows that both chemical and genetic/
immune models of inflammation-mediated carcinogenesis not only
parallel the inflammation to dysplasia to cancer sequence of
human IBD but also manifest inflammation-associated oxidative
stress in the colon as seen in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.
Unlike other colitis-associated neoplasia models using genotoxic
colon carcinogens as initiators of neoplasia (azoxymethane or 1,2dimethylhydrazine), DSS itself is not a mutagen nor genotoxic (38).
However, it has been shown to both directly and indirectly activate
macrophages and other inflammatory cells (16, 39), a central feature of genetic models of immune colitis (8–11). Thus, carcinogenesis arising in these settings is solely a manifestation of chronic
inflammation. The prominent mucosal and systemic activation
of macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and other effectors in
DSS-induced colitis, genetic immune colitis (and in active disease
of patients with IBD) is a potential source of oxidative stress. This

may cause oxidative and nitrative damage locally through oxidative
burst and through release of cytokines that induce receptormediated reactive oxygen species production by target cells.
Microsatellite instability was identified in tumors in colons of
DSS-treated wild-type mice and more so in Msh2 / mice (40).
DSS treatment also induced 8-oxoguanine residues in mouse
colonic mucosa (22), suggesting oxidative damage directly at the
site of inflammation. Notably, this observed systemic genotoxicity
is a secondary effect of DSS treatment, that is, the consequence
of systemic inflammation and inflammation-associated oxidative
stress. In agreement with these findings, we have shown 8oxoguanine and nitrotyrosine formation in the surface epithelium
and inflammatory infiltrate of IL-10 / colons as well as in
peripheral blood of IL-10 / and DSS-treated wild-type mice,
indicating systemic presence of peroxynitrite and reactive oxygen
and nitrogen species.
We envision two nonexclusive processes linking local inflammation and systemic genotoxicity. First, locally activated innate
immune cells may release reactive species inducing formation of
other reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals and NO-derived
peroxynitrite, damaging emigrating resident leukocytes that then
circulate into the periphery. Alternatively, inflammatory cytokines
achieve biologically significant systemic levels, on which they
induce autonomous, cytokine-receptor mediated production of free
radicals (and genotoxic damage) in remote leukocyte populations.
Both scenarios are possible, as we observed proinflammatory
cytokines throughout DSS treatment in the peripheral blood and
oxidative DNA damage and nitrotyrosine formation in circulating
leukocytes. Similarly, micronucleus formation in the erythroblasts
of the bone marrow in our study may have been a result of
activated T cells that are part of the normal recirculating lymphocyte pool circulating into the bone marrow and leading to
oxidative damage. Accumulation of single- and double-stranded
breaks can sequentially lead to chromosome breaks and micronuclei formation (41).
In addition, biological processes affected by inflammation may
also determine the fate of cells bearing genotoxic damage. Because
inflammatory mediators elicit both epithelial cell proliferation and

at particular risk to DNA damage leading to fixation of mutations
that may not be properly repaired and removed (22). In DSS colitis,

oxidative DNA damage was positively correlated with apoptosis in
the small intestine but not the large intestine (42). This biological
difference may contribute to the relative susceptibility to cancer
progression in the large intestine. Although the mechanism of this
differential induction of apoptosis is uncertain, genotoxic stress
induces expression of ligands for the NKG2D receptor (43). This
receptor is differentially expressed on resident CD8+ T cells and
natural killer cells of the small versus large intestine and is a potent
inducer of antiepithelial cytotoxicity in this intestinal region (44).
Finally, the possibility of reciprocal regulation of inflammation and
DNA repair pathway elements is an emerging area of investigation (45).
In summary, intestinal inflammation is associated with systemic
genotoxicity through single and double DNA strand breaks, oxidative DNA damage, protein nitration, and micronucleus formation. We propose that elements of the inflammatory response
including reactive oxygen species-derived oxidative stress are
responsible for the observed systemic genotoxicity, although the
exact cell types and inflammatory products responsible remain to
be defined. Previous studies have observed oxidative base damage,
microsatellite instability, and gene mutations directly in the colonic
mucosa of both human IBD and experimental murine colitis. Here,
we highlight that systemic DNA damage accompanied by systemic
inflammation is an early event involved in the promotion of genetic instability. Such systemic genotoxicity may be a biologically
relevant and sensitive biomarker of one process contributing to
inflammation-associated carcinogenesis.
