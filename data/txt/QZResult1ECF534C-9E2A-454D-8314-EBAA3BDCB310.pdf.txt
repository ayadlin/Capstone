Radiotherapy for Patients With the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus: Are Special
Precautions Necessary?
Nadine Housri, MD1; Robert Yarchoan, MD2; and Aradhana Kaushal, MD1

Shortly after the onset of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic in the 1980s, reports of radiation-associated toxicity in patients with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS began to appear in the
medical literature. Although the majority of reports have focused on AIDS-defining malignancies such as Kaposi sarcoma, greater-than-expected toxicity after a course of radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy has also been documented in cancers not generally classified as being related to HIV. With improved antiretroviral therapies, HIV
patients are living longer and have the potential to develop a variety of HIV-associated and nonassociated malignancies that require treatment, including radiotherapy. This review reports the published data regarding the interactions
of HIV, AIDS, and antiretroviral therapy with radiotherapy and implications for the management of malignancies in
patients with HIV. Cancer 2010;116:273–83. Published 2010 by the American Cancer Society.*
KEYWORDS: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), radiation, cancer,
malignancy, antiretroviral therapy.

Since the early days of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, it has been known that certain
malignancies, such as Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), disproportionately affect immunocompromised AIDS patients1 and these, as well as invasive cervical cancer, are designated as AIDS-defining malignancies.2 In
addition, several other tumors occur in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive individuals at higher rates compared with HIV-negative individuals.3,4 More recently, highly active combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has led
to improved survival for HIV patients, and an increased incidence of non-AIDS-associated malignancies.5 As more HIV
patients seek cancer treatment, physicians are faced with several critical questions: Do HIV patients respond to radiotherapy in a manner similar to their immunocompetent counterparts? What role does cART play in the response to treatment?
Should cART be initiated in all patients before undergoing radiotherapy? We sought to explore these issues by reviewing
the literature regarding radiotherapy in HIV-positive patients. In addition to a comprehensive review, we propose treatment recommendations, based on the strength of the best available evidence. We used the Strength of Recommendation
Taxonomy (SORT) because it is comprehensive and straightforward.6 A summary of SORT and our recommendations
are found in Tables 1, 2, and 3.
Does HIV Cause Radiosensitivity?
The most pressing concern for oncologists is the potential for radiotherapy to cause increased toxicity, especially mucosal
and cutaneous, in patients with HIV. Early reports of extreme mucositis in HIV-KS patients treated with radiotherapy7,8
led scientists to investigate whether HIV could be radiosensitizing. A cellular basis for radiosensitivity is supported by findings that fibroblasts from the skin of HIV patients with KS are more sensitive to ionizing radiation compared with those
of healthy controls.9 One proposed explanation for this is that HIV induces a systemic glutathione deficiency, leading to a

depletion of radioprotective thiols and increased oxidative
stress.10 In addition, the HIV-1 Tat protein has been
found to sensitize rhabdomyosarcoma cells to ionizing
radiation by reducing the cellular capacity to repair radiation-induced, double-stranded DNA breaks and by dysregulating cell cycle checkpoints.11 However, it remains to
be determined whether these in vitro effects in fact contribute to increased radiation sensitivity in HIV-infected
patients.
Radiosensitivity in Patients Treated
for AIDS-Defining Malignancies
Kaposi sarcoma

KS lesions are highly radiosensitive, and radiotherapy has been used for KS since the beginning of the AIDS
epidemic. Perhaps because of this extensive experience,
altered sensitivity to radiotherapy has been more widely
reported in patients treated for KS than any other tumor.
Multiple series of patients treated in the pre-cART era
reported that most tolerated radiation well, with the
exception that toxicity was often reported in patients
treated for oral lesions.7,8,12,13 Severe mucositis and
impaired salivary function were reported at doses of 7.5
grays (Gy) to 27 Gy, doses that generally do not cause oral
toxicity in the HIV-uninfected population.7,8,12,13 As will
be noted later in this review, reports of oral toxicity from
radiotherapy are more common in patients with HIV-KS

than in HIV-positive patients with other head and neck
tumors. By contrast, intracavitary radiotherapy was
reportedly well tolerated when used to treat oral KS
lesions, with only mild membrane reactions and no interruption of therapy noted.14 Although rarer, cutaneous
toxicity with pain, skin erythema, and desquamation and
ulceration in the treatment of KS of the feet has been
reported for doses of 20 Gy administered in 10 fractions.12 KS is caused by KS-associated herpes virus
(KSHV),15 and it is conceivable that a response of this virus to radiation may contribute to the radiation toxicity
observed in patients with KS. Both acute mucosal and cutaneous toxicity were found to be transient, with the majority of patients recovering within 10 days of the
initiation of symptoms to 1 week after completing treatment.12,16 However, patients frequently develop longterm mucosal and cutaneous changes, including a woody
appearance and pigmentation changes.
With the advent of cART, the incidence of KS and
the need for radiotherapy for this condition have declined.
To the best of our knowledge, there is only 1 prospective
trial performed during the cART era, which reported
equal rates of response and cutaneous toxicity for patients
treated to 24 Gy in 12 fractions versus 20 Gy in 5 fractions.17 Mucosal toxicity was uncommon in both treatment groups (occurring in 2 and 0 individuals,
respectively). Although the results of this trial are promising, only 10 of 60 patients were receiving cART, and a

subset analysis of these patients was not performed.
Therefore, further prospective data are required to determine whether KS patients receiving cART exhibit
increased radiotoxicity.
The goal of KS therapy is long-term palliation; to
the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence that
achieving a complete response is curative. A sizable percentage of patients with HIV-KS will respond to cART
alone, and liposomal anthracyclines are generally effective
and well-tolerated for patients with more extensive disease.18,19 Given these alternative treatment options, radiotherapy of KS is now generally reserved for patients with
disease that is limited in extent but causing pain or other
patient distress. The benefits of radiotherapy must be
weighed against other treatment options and the shortterm and long-term toxicities. Acceptable palliative doses
range from 8 Gy administered in a single fraction to 30
Gy administered in 10 fractions, tailored to individual
patients.8 Because past experiences have documented that
toxicity occurs transiently and early in treatment, we recommend that patients be closely monitored and symptomatic relief provided until symptom resolution.
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma

As with KS, the incidence of NHL in the HIV-positive population has decreased significantly, corresponding
to the increased use of cART.3 In 1 study, patients receiving radiotherapy for systemic NHL had a >60% rate of
grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicity.20 However, it is likely
that much of this toxicity was because of concurrent
chemotherapy, which was given to all but 1 patient in this
study. Before the development of cART, hematologic toxicity secondary to chemotherapy led to the use of lymphoma regimens in HIV-infected patients that used
reduced drug doses.21 More recently, acceptable toxicity
has been reported with regimens using full-dose chemotherapy.22-24 To the best of our knowledge, there are few
data available regarding the toxicity of radiation or chemoradiation in HIV-positive patients with systemic lymphoma who are receiving cART, and therefore it remains
unclear whether treatment modifications are necessarily.
Primary central nervous system lymphoma
(PCNSL) occurs with a substantially increased incidence
in patients with HIV, especially in those with <50 CD4
cells/mm3. Before the development of cART, the standard
treatment of patients with PCNSL was radiotherapy.
However, survival was extremely poor, with the majority
of patients dying of disease recurrence or complications
from AIDS within 2 to 4 months.19 In a pre-cART trial

276

evaluating the utility of preirradiation chemotherapy in
the treatment of patients with PCNSL, radiotoxicity was
rare, with only 2 of 41 patients experiencing grade 3 toxicity.25 Although there was no grade 4 or 5 toxicity noted
secondary to radiotherapy, approximately 80% of patients
experienced grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicities with
chemotherapy.
With the advent of cART, HIV-PCNSL therapy
comprised of whole-brain radiotherapy and cART has
been found to improve survival, more so than radiation
alone26 or cART alone.27 Radiation doses >30 Gy are
reportedly predictive of improved survival in patients
with HIV.26 Late radiation-induced neurotoxicity is a
well-known and potentially devastating adverse effect of
both chemoradiation and radiation alone in HIV-negative
patients with PCNSL, especially those aged >60 years.28
However, because of the extremely poor survival of
patients with HIV-associated PCNSL before the development of cART, it is unknown whether AIDS patients exhibit increased neurotoxicity compared with HIVuninfected patients. With the development of cART,
patients with PCNSL currently have the potential for
long-term survival from their AIDS, and the risk of longterm radiation neurotoxicity is a substantially greater concern. In part because of this concern, methotrexate-based
chemotherapy is now the standard of care for PCNSL in
patients without HIV, and it has been tested in limited
numbers of patients with HIV-PCNSL, alone29 or in
combination with whole-brain radiotherapy.30 Some
experts recommend the use of chemotherapy with a deferral of whole-brain radiotherapy as salvage treatment,
whereas others recommend combined modality therapy.28 With the availability of cART, there is a need for
more clinical studies to determine the best therapy for
patients with HIV-PCNSL. Until such information is
available to guide the physician, decisions regarding
chemotherapy and radiation should be based on the available evidence, with consideration given to the patient’s
age, acute symptoms, potential to respond to cART, CD4
count, and ability to tolerate various treatment options.
Cervical cancer

Unlike NHL and KS, the incidence of cervical cancer in HIV-positive patients has not decreased in recent
years.2,3 Chemoradiation remains 1 of the mainstays of
treatment in patients with both early stage and advanced
disease.31 Surprisingly, to the best of our knowledge there
is little literature describing the response to radiotherapy
in HIV-positive women with cervical cancer. In what to

Cancer

our knowledge is the only prospective study comparing
HIV-positive with HIV-negative women with cervical
cancer published to date, no difference in overall toxicity
was reported when patients were treated with 40 to 60 Gy
of external beam radiotherapy and no concurrent chemotherapy. Although gastrointestinal and cutaneous toxicity
was comparable in both cohorts, genitourinary toxicity
was found to be significantly increased in patients with
HIV (5-fold), as was multisystem toxicity (7-fold). HIVpositive patients were twice as likely to have treatment
interruptions, most often because of acute toxicity. In
addition, HIV-positive women were 3 times more likely
to have residual tumor than HIV-negative women, despite
being prescribed and receiving similar doses of
radiation.32
A large study from Mumbai in which patients were
treated with 45 to 50 Gy of external beam radiotherapy
followed by 25 to 30 Gy of intracavitary radiation
reported a high proportion of grade 3 cutaneous and gastrointestinal toxicities (27% and 9%, respectively) and 1
case of grade 4 gastrointestinal toxicity.33 Data regarding
CD4þ counts were not collected in either of these large
cohorts.
Standard chemoradiation (or surgery for early stage
disease) has been recommended for women who are HIV
positive, although these recommendations are older than
the previously mentioned reports.31,34 At the University
of Miami, in which there is a relatively high incidence of
both HIV and cervical cancer, dose modifications are generally undertaken if the CD4 count is <200 cells/mm3.
The daily fraction size is reduced to 1.5 Gy and the weekly
cisplatin dose is reduced to 30 to 35 mg/m2. These modifications result in tolerance similar to that of HIV-negative patients (unpublished data). Further prospective data
are required to recommend optimal chemoradiation
doses. As with any course of pelvic irradiation, patients
should be followed closely for gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and cutaneous toxicities.
Anal cancer

Although not considered an AIDS-defining malignancy, anal cancer is 80-fold to 120-fold more common
in HIV-positive patients and its incidence continues to
rise, despite widespread cART usage.3,35 Similar to cervical cancer, anal cancer is associated with infection by
high-risk strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV).
Pre-cART reports of HIV patients with anal cancer documented poor response to combination therapy, with HIV
and AIDS patients undergoing more treatment breaks,

hospitalizations, and chemotherapy dose reductions than
HIV-negative patients.36-38 Grade 3 and 4 skin toxicities,
grade 4 gastrointestinal toxicity, and grade 2 and 3 myelosuppression were commonly reported.38,39 Several
patients developed chronic diarrhea, fistula formation,
perirectal abscesses, and hospitalization because of moist
desquamation.36-39 Although some authors have reported
higher rates of treatment failure in HIV-positive
patients,36 most reported excellent response rates.38-40
In a series from San Francisco, Hoffman et al41
emphasized that patients with CD4 counts >200 cells/
mm3 had significantly improved tolerance to combination chemotherapy and radiation doses of 32.4 Gy to
63 Gy when compared with those with counts <200 cells/
mm3. Nearly all the patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/
mm3 developed severe toxicities (moist desquamation or
neutropenia), resulting in treatment breaks of 1 to 4 weeks.
In comparison, less than half of the patients with CD4
counts >200 cells/mm3 required treatment breaks of 2
weeks and none required colostomies. The findings of Hoffman et al are supported by observations that a low CD4
count in patients with HIV and anal cancer tends to be associated with increased treatment breaks, pancytopenia, platelet transfusion, blood transfusions, grade 4 leukopenia, and
anemia.42 By contrast to the above findings, several studies
have challenged the assertion that higher CD4 counts are
correlated with better treatment tolerance and have found
no difference in toxicity based on the CD4 count.40,43-45
Thus, the role of the CD4 count in response to therapy
remains controversial.
Toxicity remains an important concern in patients
with anal cancer, regardless of HIV status. Because poor
tolerance to (and an incomplete course of) radiotherapy is
predictive of treatment failure,46 minimizing toxicity is of
paramount importance for all patients with anal cancer. It
is not advisable to treat HIV patients with lower doses of
radiation because patients treated to doses 45 Gy have a
survival advantage compared with those treated with
35 Gy.47 Recently, Seo et al reported no increased toxicity in immunodeficient versus immunocompetent
patients with anal cancer when treating to doses of >55
Gy using 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy.45 One
multicenter study of chemotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to 45 Gy found that hematologic toxicity in HIV patients was similar to that of
immunocompetent patients.48 Likewise, overall survival,
local control, colostomy-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival rates were found to be similar between
the HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients. Currently

277

Review Article

the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) is
investigating whether the use of IMRT can decrease the
rates of acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities
in immunocompetent patients.48
Presently, many experts recommend standard treatment, especially if a patient has good performance status.40,43-45 Selective omission of chemotherapy and of
lymph node radiotherapy in patients with very early stage
disease has been suggested to decrease toxicity.42,43
Although cisplatin has been recommended instead of mitomycin C,44,49 the use of cisplatin over mitomycin C has
been shown in immunocompetent patients to increase the
rate of colostomy, with no effect on disease-free survival
noted.50 The combination of 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C has also been reported to be safe and tolerable in
immunodeficient patients.45 How to best treat patients
with anal cancer who are HIV positive with a CD4 count
<200 cells/mm3 remains an area of controversy. With the
exception of patients with very early stage disease, it is not
advisable to treat patients with radiation alone because of
the high risk of failure and subsequent salvage colostomy.
The decision to modify treatment for patients with CD4
counts <200 cells/mm3 should be made in a multidisciplinary setting with the infectious disease physician,
radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist giving consideration to the comorbidities of the patient and their
ability to tolerate and complete aggressive therapy. Potentially modifying chemotherapy dosages or using a slightly
smaller pelvic field to spare the gastrointestinal tract
should be considered. Anal cancer is not considered an
AIDS-defining condition and, to our knowledge, there is
little evidence that the administration of cART directly
affects the course of this disease. Anal cancer in an HIVinfected patient is not considered an indication to initiate
cART unless the patient meets other criteria for cART
administration.51
Radiosensitivity in Tumors Common
to the General Population
Prostate cancer

Although the incidence of prostate cancer has been
reported to be lower in the HIV-positive population compared with the general population, its incidence among
patients with HIV is increasing.3 Multiple series on HIV
patients treated with radiotherapy reported good, acute
tolerance to standard doses of radiation, similar to that for
prostate cancer in the general population.52-55 Pantanowitz et al recently reported on 17 HIV-positive patients
from multiple institutions who were treated for prostate

278

cancer with surgery, hormonal therapy, and radiotherapy.
No serious treatment-related side effects were reported.55
On the basis of the literature and our experiences and
those of our colleagues, we recommend that HIV-positive
patients with prostate cancer should be treated in the same
way as their HIV-negative counterparts.
Lung cancer

Lung cancer is the most common non-AIDS defining malignancy diagnosed in HIV-positive patients and
arises with a higher incidence than in the general population.3,56,57 There are several possible reasons for this
increase, including the increased use of tobacco among
HIV-infected patients compared with the general population.57,58 However, there is evidence that immunodeficiency also may contribute to the high rate of lung cancer
reported in this population.57,59
There are several case reports documenting esophageal toxicity for lung cancer patients treated to doses of 45
Gy to 50.4 Gy. In 1 report in which the total dose to the
esophagus was 47.9 Gy (which is well below the normal
dose tolerance of the esophagus of 68 Gy60), a patient
developed esophagitis and odynophagia 3 weeks into
treatment, followed by progression to an esophageal stricture less than 1 month after treatment was completed.61
Another case reported esophageal stricture in an HIV-positive patient treated at a total dose of 59 Gy <2 months after the completion of treatment.62 The first patient was
receiving azidothymidine (AZT) at the time of diagnosis;
his CD4 count was unknown. The CD4 count of the second patient was 44 cells/mm3 at the time of diagnosis and
he was noncompliant with cART. Because to the best of
our knowledge there are only 2 cases of radiation-induced
esophageal stricture occurring in HIV-infected patients
reported in the literature to date, it is unknown whether
CD4 count or cART play a role in severe esophageal
reactions.
In a larger series of 22 patients treated in France,
none of the 4 patients treated with radiotherapy used
alone or as adjuvant treatment reported radiotoxicity. All
4 patients had CD4 counts 200 cells/mm3, and
3 patients were receiving cART.63 The Italian Cooperative Group on AIDS and Tumors described a cohort of
36 patients treated for lung cancer. Of the 6 patients who
were treated with radiotherapy and were assessable for toxicity, 4 developed radiation-induced esophagitis, 3 had
grade 3 symptoms, and 1 had grade 1 symptoms. No
patient was treated to a dose >60 Gy.64 We are unaware
of any cases of increased radiation-induced pneumonitis

in patients with HIV. Patients with localized disease who
are treated with cART demonstrate a modest improvement in survival, although it remains controversial
whether cART improves outcomes in patients with
advanced disease.59,65 Although some authors suggest
that HIV-positive patients should be treated similarly to
the general population,56 more clinical data are required
for a more thorough understanding of the effects of radiation and chemotherapy in HIV-positive patients with
lung cancer.
Head and neck malignancies

There is an increasing appreciation that in the cART
era, patients with HIV infection have an increased risk of
developing head and neck tumors.4 Many of these tumors
are related to infection with high-risk strains of HPV, and
there is some evidence that HPV-related head and neck
tumors behave differently from other head and neck cancers.66 Although reports regarding mucosal toxicity after
radiotherapy for KS of the head and neck are abundant in
the literature, to our knowledge there are only a few
reports of radiotoxicity in patients treated for other head
and neck malignancies. A small series published in 1999
was comprised of 8 patients with HIV diagnosed with
cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx: 4 had KS and 4
had other malignancies. When compared with the KS
group, the patients with non-KS malignancies were able
to tolerate higher doses to larger volumes of tissue with
significantly less severe mucosal reactions reported. No
correlation between CD4 count and tolerance was noted
for either group.67 A more recent report of an HIV-positive patient with early laryngeal cancer and a CD4 count
of 350 cells/mm3 reported an excellent response to a dose
of 66 Gy.68 Despite these few reported cases of good tolerance, there are inadequate data to recommend treatment
modifications for patients with head and neck cancer.
Testicular cancer

Although there are conflicting data regarding this
point, several epidemiologic studies published to date
have indicated that seminoma occurs with an increased
frequency in HIV-positive men.4,69 Several series have
reported no increased radiotoxicity in patients receiving
radiation for both seminoma and nonseminoma germ cell
tumors in doses of 20 Gy to 36 Gy to the infradiaphragmatic, lumboaortic, and iliac lymph nodes.70-74 However,
in many patients in these and other series, there were
reports of significant declines in CD4 counts of 100 cells/
mm3 to 200 cells/mm3.72,75 Some pre-cART studies have

Cancer

January 15, 2010

reported opportunistic infections developing after radiotherapy,76-78 but few of the recently treated patients developed opportunistic infections as a result of declines in
their CD4 counts.70,71,74,79 A large Italian series reported
grade 3 and 4 toxicities in nearly half of the patients evaluated, but no differences between HIV-negative and
HIV-positive patients were noted.70 Although to the best
of our knowledge there is no consensus regarding whether
to continue cART therapy during chemotherapy, the
decreases in CD4 counts observed during radiotherapy
and the risk of subsequent opportunistic infections should
favor its use. We recommend that patients with testicular
cancer be treated with standard radiotherapy.
Breast and colorectal cancer

Some studies, especially those published before the
widespread use of cART, have reported a decreased incidence of breast cancer in women with HIV, whereas
others present a similar incidence among the HIV-positive population.3,4,69,80,81 Although there are various
reports on the poor response of HIV-positive women to
chemotherapy, reports of radiation toxicity could not be
identified.82-84 Radiotherapy has been reported to be
well-tolerated in patients treated to 64.8 Gy and 65
Gy.85,86 However, to the best of our knowledge, there is
insufficient evidence to recommend any treatment modifications for HIV-positive women with breast cancer.
To our knowledge, no clear effects of HIV infection
on the incidence of colon cancer have been reported to
date.3,4,69,81 The few cases published to date have identified patients presenting at young ages and with advanced
stages of disease.87,88 Wasserberg et al reported good tolerance to adjuvant chemotherapy in an 11-patient series,
but did not comment on the radiation tolerance of the
4 patients who received radiotherapy.87 Cappell et al
treated an AIDS patient with radiation for abdominal
pain and reported no major complications.89 However,
more data are needed before a recommendation can be
made for treatment modifications in HIV-positive
patients with colorectal cancer .
Does Radiotherapy Adversely Affect HIV
Disease Status and CD4 Counts?
Radiotherapy has been shown to decrease various immunologic parameters, including CD4 counts, especially
when the field is large and includes substantial lymphoid
tissue or bone marrow. De Ruysscher et al observed both
retrospectively and prospectively that breast cancer
patients had significantly decreased CD4 T-cells during

279

Review Article

radiotherapy. Declines of approximately 200 cells/mm3
were observed for up to 5 to 6 years after radiotherapy.
Similarly, low levels of CD4 T-cells were found in men
previously treated for testicular cancer.90 Other studies
have also found radiotherapy to significantly reduce CD4
counts in HIV-negative patients with NHL, as well as
cancers of the head and neck, genitourinary tract, anus,
and lung.42,91-93
Although reduced CD4 cell counts have been
reported in both HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients
after radiotherapy, to the best of our knowledge it has not
been clearly demonstrated that this clinically leads to an
increased risk of opportunistic or other infections, especially if patients are treated with cART.42,70,79 This failure
to observe a clinical effect may in part reflect the small size
of the studies examining this point. It also has been suggested that the resistance and relatively quick response of
natural killer cells protect against potential infections.90
Nonetheless, some investigators suggest prophylactic antibiotic therapy during radiotherapy.73
The cART Question
The use of cART has been associated with a decreased risk
for several cancers, especially those associated with low
CD4 counts such as KS, NHL, or PCNSL.3 Moreover,
cART has been shown to increase the overall survival for
patients with NHL, and has been shown to cause remissions in patients with KS.94 However, it has been suggested that particular HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) may
cause radiosensitization of normal tissue, leading to
increased radiotoxicity.35,49 The basis of these concerns
lies in the reported radiosensitizing abilities of nelfinavir,
saquinavir, and amprenavir. There is evidence that PIs
may inhibit the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (PI3K)
pathway, which is overexpressed in certain tumors and
results in resistance to ionizing radiation. The radiosensitizing effect of PIs, as well as their action on the PI3K
pathway, has been observed both in vivo and in vitro.95
Despite the laboratory evidence suggesting radiosensitization, to our knowledge PIs have not been reported to
clinically increase radiotoxicity. Results of a recent phase 1
trial of nelfinavir (at the standard treatment dose of 1250
mg twice daily) combined with chemoradiation for the
treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer did not demonstrate increased toxicity when compared with the use of
chemoradiotherapy alone.96 In addition, a retrospective
review compared HIV-positive patients receiving radiosensitizing PIs and radiotherapy with control HIV-positive patients being treated with nonradiosensitizing PIs.

280

After finding no difference with regard to acute or late
grade 2 or 3 toxicities between the 2 groups, the authors
concluded that standard doses of PIs may be safely combined with radiotherapy.97
Although to our knowledge interactions between
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and
radiotherapy have not been well-documented in the literature, there remain theoretical concerns for patients
receiving cART during therapy because of the myelosuppresive or neuropathic effects of some cART agents.
Some have suggested that myelosuppressive antiretroviral drugs, such as zidovudine, be avoided if radiation
fields will be encompassing large areas of bone marrow
or if radiation will be administered with myelosuppressive chemotherapeutics, such as cisplatin and alkylators.
In addition, it is unknown whether drugs associated
with neuropathy (such as didanosine, stavudine, or zalcitabine) should be avoided if a patient is to receive
extensive nerve or central nervous system radiation.98
Management decisions should be made on a case-bycase basis and in consultation with a physician experienced in treating HIV-positive patients.
One important question is whether patients not previously treated with cART or prophylactic antibiotics
should be started on such medications before the initiation of radiotherapy. To the best of our knowledge, there
are presently no controlled studies to address this point
and no specific recommendations for the initiation of
cART in the treatment of HIV-positive patients with cancer, except in the case of the AIDS-defining cancers.51,99
However, it is interesting to note that there are emerging
data indicating that even non-AIDS-defining tumors may
be more frequent in patients whose CD4 count is <500
cells/mm3 for 1 year or who receive intermittent
cART.51,100 For patients with CD4 counts >350 cells/
mm3 and no AIDS-defining malignancies, it is generally
recommended that decisions should be based on comorbidities, risk of disease progression, and the patient’s ability to adhere to long-term therapy.51
Conclusions
As immunologic status and long-term survival continue
to improve for patients with HIV, the incidence of common malignancies will increase in this aging population.
Radiotherapy will remain a mainstay of treatment for
many individuals with cancer and HIV. Although standard-of-care radiotherapy should be prescribed to the majority of patients, those treated to the head and neck,
abdomen, and pelvis should be closely monitored for

possible mucosal reactions, as should patients treated with
concurrent chemotherapy for hematologic effects. If
cART is indicated by current guidelines, a physician experienced in treating HIV-positive patients should be consulted for the optimal antiretroviral regimen. Further
investigations, especially prospective studies, are required
to accurately document radiotoxicity in HIV-positive
patients with cancer.
