ABSTRACT
Urothelial carcinoma, or transitional cell carcinoma, is the most common urologic
malignancy that carries significant morbidity, mortality, recurrence risk and associated
health care costs. Despite use of current chemotherapies and immunotherapies, longterm remission in patients with muscle-invasive or metastatic disease remains low,
and disease recurrence is common. The molecular chaperone Heat Shock Protein-90
(Hsp90) may offer an ideal treatment target, as it is a critical signaling hub in
urothelial carcinoma pathogenesis and potentiates chemoradiation. Preclinical testing
with Hsp90 inhibitors has demonstrated reduced proliferation, enhanced apoptosis
and synergism with chemotherapies and radiation. Despite promising preclinical
data, clinical trials utilizing Hsp90 inhibitors for other malignancies had modest
efficacy. Therefore, we propose that Hsp90 inhibition would best serve as an adjuvant
treatment in advanced muscle-invasive or metastatic bladder cancers to potentiate
other therapies. An overview of bladder cancer biology, current treatments, molecular
targeted therapies, and the role for Hsp90 inhibitors in the treatment of urothelial
carcinoma is the focus of this review.

More than 90 percent of bladder cancers are
urothelial carcinomas (transitional cell carcinomas).
Squamous cell carcinomas comprise approximately
5 percent of bladder cancers, and less common neoplasms
include micropapillary urothelial carcinoma, small
cell carcinoma, sarcomas, and other rare tumors [7]. In
addition, other solid tumors may metastasize to the bladder
through local spread (prostate, testicular, ovarian, cervical,
and endometrial cancers) [7, 8].
Of all newly diagnosed urothelial carcinomas,
nearly 70 percent are non-muscle invasive and are treated
surgically with transurethral resection with or without
intravesical therapies [9, 10]. Non-muscle invasive
urothelial carcinoma frequently recurs, in 50 to 70 percent
of patients, while muscle-invasive disease has a propensity
to metastasize [11]. There is a risk of progression to
muscle invasive disease, occurring in up to 15 percent of
non-muscle invasive tumors [11].

INTRODUCTION
Epidemiology
Bladder cancer is the fifth most common type of
cancer and the second most frequent urologic malignancy
in males after prostate cancer. It is the ninth leading cause
of cancer death in the United States. The median age at
diagnosis and death are 73 and 79 years respectively [1].
In 2014, there were an estimated 74, 690 new cases of
bladder cancer and 15, 580 deaths [1]. In the United States,
the estimated lifetime risk of urothelial carcinoma is 1 of
25 in men and 1 of 80 in women [2]. In fact, there is a 3:1
male-to-female predominance in urothelial carcinoma,
likely related to protective effect of estrogens and increased
androgen-receptor signaling in males [3–5]. Health care
costs associated with treatment and surveillance of bladder
cancer exceed that of all other malignancies, making the
design of effective therapies essential not only for patients,
but also for public health [6].

Risk factors

and progress despite various sources of cellular stress.
The  heat shock response prevents cancer cells from
undergoing apoptosis, despite an accumulation of genomic
mutations, and hostile hypoxic and/or acidotic tumor
environments [20]. Several proteins involved in bladder
cancer biology are regulated by the Hsp90 chaperone
complex, which aids in their stabilization, maintains their
protein expression and promotes oncogenesis.

Advanced age and smoking are major  risk factors
for developing bladder cancer. A  meta-analysis of
epidemiologic studies showed that cigarette smokers have
a four-fold increased risk than that of nonsmokers and the
number of pack-years further increased that risk. More than
50 percent of urothelial carcinomas occur in smokers, which
make up 14.5 to 21 percent of the population [12]. This
equates to one-half of male urinary tract cancers and onethird of female urinary tract cancers that are attributed to
cigarette smoking [13, 14]. Smoking promotes progression
of non-invasive to muscle-invasive tumors, and cessation
improves long-term prognosis when compared to chronic
smokers [15]. Additional risk factors in urothelial carcinoma
include chronic exposure to aromatic amine and aniline
dyes, Schistosomiasis infection, prior pelvic irradiation,
arsenic exposure, phenacetin-containing analgesics and
chemotherapy drugs (particularly alkylating agents) [16].

Hsp90: a signaling hub in urothelial
carcinoma biology
Structure and function
Hsp90 plays an important role in urothelial carcinoma
biology, as well as in carcinogenesis of other tumors, by its
function as a molecular chaperone that cancer cells utilize
to protect over-expressed or mutated oncoproteins from
misfolding and degradation [21–25]. Proteins chaperoned
by Hsp90, also known as clients, control numerous cellular
processes that support tumor growth and metastasis,
including signal transduction, angiogenesis, anti-apoptotic
pathways and tumor invasion [26]. Hsp90 is a homo-dimeric
protein that comprises of three domains: i) the N-terminal
domain, containing nucleotide, drug and co-chaperone
(proteins that regulate Hsp90 function) binding sites; ii) the
middle (M) domain, which provides binding motif for client
proteins and other co-chaperones, and iii) the C-terminal
domain containing a dimerization motif and binding sites
for yet other co-chaperones. An unstructured charged-linker
region connects N and M domains and, therefore, provides
conformational flexibility to the Hsp90 protein [27–37]
(Figure 2). Hsp90 function is coupled to its ATPase activity
[38] and this, in turn, provides conformational cycle that
is “fine-tuned” by co-chaperones and post-translational
modifications such phosphorylation, acetylation,
ubiquitination, oxidation, methylation, S-nitrosylation and
SUMOylation [39–44] (Figure 2). Clinically evaluated
Hsp90 inhibitors disrupt the chaperone cycle by occupying
the nucleotide-binding pocket in the N-domain, therefore,
inhibiting the ATPase activity [32, 45]. As a result, Hsp90dependent client proteins are ubiquitinated and degraded in
the proteasome [43, 46–48].

Pathology
Bladder cancers are staged and prognosticated
according to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging
system [7]. Non-muscle invasive bladder cancers and
muscle-invasive bladder cancers have distinct phenotypic,
etiologic, and prognostic characteristics. Non-muscle
invasive bladder cancers are, by definition, confined to
the mucosa or submucosa, while muscle invasive bladder
cancers invade into the muscularis propria or serosal
surface of the bladder. Non-muscle invasive urothelial
carcinoma develops with hyperplasia of the epithelium
with development of branching vessels to form a papillary
pattern [17]. Urothelial hyperplasia can progress to
form low-grade urothelial carcinoma, which has a high
recurrence risk, or can progress to a high-grade tumor [18].
Muscle invasive urothelial carcinoma involves dysplasia of
the urothelium and occasionally progresses from carcinoma
in situ (CIS) [17]. CIS is high grade, and has the propensity
to progress to an invasive carcinoma, and muscle invasive
tumors with a higher risk of metastasis [7].
Urothelial carcinoma pathogenesis
The molecular pathogenesis of urothelial carcinomas
requires deregulation of multiple signal transduction
pathways, therefore, it is a malignancy in which molecular
targeted therapies will be useful to block key signaling
events involved in bladder cancer biology [19]. Urothelial
carcinomas are genetically complex with various
oncogenic drivers, numerous mutations within a single
tumor, copy number alterations, gene fusion transcripts,
and cytogenetic aberrations (Figure 1). Muscle invasive
urothelial carcinomas have more mutations, chromosomal
aberrations, and aneuploidy than the non-invasive tumors,
however, there are common genes implicated in the
pathogenesis of both types.
Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are over-expressed in
both non-muscle invasive and muscle invasive bladder
cancers [20]. They allow bladder cancer cells to survive

Protein clients
Several Hsp90 client proteins act as drivers of
urothelial carcinoma, and thus inhibitors or modulators
of Hsp90 function may impede urothelial carcinoma
pathogenesis (Figures 1 and 3). A recent comprehensive
study, by the Cancer Genome Atlas Project, identified
novel protein determinants involved in urothelial
carcinoma including: tumor suppressors (TP53, Rb)
[49,  50], oncogenes (ErbB2/HER2, ErbB3, Myc)
[49,  51,  52], cell cycle regulatory proteins (by Hsp90
and Cdc37 co-chaperone, cyclins and cyclin-dependent
kinases, including Cdk2) [53, 54], Ras-MAPK pathway
proteins (HRas and multiple MAP kinases) [55], mTOR
pathway components (Akt) [56], growth factor receptors

Figure 1: Signaling networks and treatment targets in muscle-invasive and metastatic urothelial carcinomas. Growth factor
signaling is increased in urothelial carcinoma [60]. This results in triggering of growth factor receptors (ERBB-2, ERBB-3, EGFR, FGFR1,
FGFR3) leading to Ras activation. Hyperactivation of Ras is a key transition from a non-invasive to an invasive phenotype in urothelial
carcinomas [18]. Ras hyperactivation results in phosphotidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, that leads to Akt and mTOR activation
downstream. Ras hyperactivation also increases activity of MAP kinases, which activate key regulators of the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition [81]. This ultimately leads to an inhibition of E-cadherin expression, promoting local invasion of the tumor through a loss of
appropriate cell-cell adhesion [189]. Ras also induces RAF-MEK-ERK signaling, which impacts cytoskeletal dynamics as well as induces
a heat shock factor response with increased activity of Hsp27 and Hsp90, as well as other components [155]. Ras is negatively regulated by
NF1, which is deficient in some urothelial carcinomas, allowing for uninhibited Ras activation. PI3K activity is inhibited by PTEN, which
is also deficient in some urothelial carcinomas due to mutation, leading to increased activation of Akt by PI3K [60, 190]. Akt inhibits the
tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) that acts as a negative regulator of mTORC1 activity. PI3K-Akt activation, as well as mutation within
a TSC component (TSC1 or TSC2), leads to inappropriate mTORC1 activation by Rheb GTPase [191]. mTORC1 promotes numerous
anabolic processes, including cell growth, metabolism, protein translation, and hypoxic signaling through increased production of hypoxiainducible factor-1 (HIF-1) [192]. HIF-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promote angiogenesis and support an intratumor
vasculature. Akt also stimulates the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 2 to activate NF-kB and promote cytoskeletal
growth [193]. NF-kB in turn inhibits p53, which promotes apoptotic resistance [194]. Loss of p53 expression leads to uninhibited cell cycle
progression, as does loss of the retinoblastoma (RB1) tumor suppressor gene [195]. Reduced RB1 expression results from mutation of its
locus as well as through reduced accessibility of chromatin to transcribe its locus from inactivation of the SWI-SNF chromatin remodeling
complex [84]. Increased cell cycle progression, paired with an increase in anabolic processes, promotes survival and growth of the tumor.
*Molecules in red are upregulated in urothelial carcinomas, while those in green are downregulated. Molecular targeted therapies to disrupt
these key processes implicated in urothelial carcinomas growth and progression are highlighted in boxes.

dimerization of the N-domains “closed” conformation leading to ATP hydrolysis [38]. The co-chaperones such as Aha1, Cdc37, HOP and
p23 and post-translational modification influence the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Domain labeling is as follows: N, N-domain (red); CL, charged

cancers, due to the inactivation of cell cycle-regulating
tumor suppressor genes (including TP53, RB, ATM),
mutation of cell cycle progression regulators (CDKN1A,
CDKN2A, CCND1, and CCNE1), or activating mutations
of genes promoting cell cycle progression (including MDM2
and E2F3). Inactivation of the cell cycle regulator p53
results in G1 to S cell cycle progression and uncontrolled
cell growth in urothelial carcinomas. p53 is inactivated in
muscle invasive bladder cancers to a greater extent than
non-muscle invasive bladder cancers (24 versus 76 percent)
[17, 60]. Wild type p53 is also a known client of Hsp90, and
interacts with Hsp90 through its DNA binding domain [66].
Hsp90 stabilizes mutant p53 through inhibiting the protooncogene MDM2 to function as an E3 ubiquitin protein
ligase [67, 68]. Although many urothelial carcinomas
exhibit p53 inactivation, Hsp90 inhibitors can still promote
growth arrest. In lymphocytic leukaemia cells, inhibition
of Hsp90 was found to have opposing effects on wild-type
and mutant p53 proteins, with stabilization and increased
expression of the wild-type protein [69]. Upregulation of
p53 results in increased p21 expression, which induces
cell cycle arrest at the G1 to S transition point [69]. Hsp90
inhibition induces apoptosis through p53-dependent
induction, mediated by PUMA and Bax [68]. Inactivation
of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor gene is present
in approximately 50 percent of high grade and muscleinvasive urothelial carcinomas [70]. Additionally, urothelial
carcinomas are the most common carcinomas in survivors
with RB cancer [71]. RB loss alone cannot accelerate
urothelial proliferation, but inhibits p53. In an animal model
for urothelial carcinoma, mice deficient in both RB and
P53, but not either tumor suppressor gene alone, were the
most sensitive to carcinogen exposure. Growth inhibition
induced by Hsp90 inhibitors, occurs through G1 to S phase
arrest through reducing RB phosphorylation. RB inhibition
reduces expression of cyclin-associated kinases D and E, to
prevent cell cycle progression. This was supported by the
absence of growth arrest in cells lacking RB, compared to
wild-type RB expression [72].

Hsp90 and oncogenic signaling pathways in
urothelial carcinoma pathogenesis
Urothelial carcinomas have somatic mutations
of tumor suppressor genes, which include, but are not
limited to TP53, RB1, PTEN, TSC1, and p16, and
activation of oncogenic drivers [60, 63] (Figure 1).
While mutations in tumor suppressor genes allow for
uncontrolled cell proliferation and cell cycle progression,
the driver mutation present in many urothelial carcinomas
is mutation or gene fusion of the fibroblast growth factor
receptor 3 (FGFR3) [58].
Fibroblast growth factor signaling
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) is
a tyrosine kinase receptor and key regulator of cellular
growth and differentiation. FGFR3 depends on Hsp90
for its stability and function and treatment with Hsp90
inhibitors target FGFR3 for degradation [58]. FGFR3
is shown to be over-expressed in 75 percent of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancers. It is upregulated by
multiple mechanisms in bladder cancer cells: 1) somatic
mutation, 2) over-expression of the wild-type protein, or 3)
gene fusion with transforming acid coiled coil (TACC3)
or BAI-1 associated protein 2-like 1 (BAI1AP2L1)
partners  [64]. FGFR3-TACC3 or FGFR3-BAI1AP2L1
gene fusions can serve as the drivers of oncogenesis in
bladder cancer cells, especially in non-muscle invasive
bladder cancers, as they activate numerous downstream
signaling pathways, including PI3K-Akt-mTOR,
Ras, MAP kinases, STATs, and phospholipase-Cγ [65].
Cell cycle deregulation
Loss of cell cycle control is characteristic of
carcinogenesis in urothelial carcinoma, as in many other

Figure 3: Hsp90 is a central hub to bladder cancer signaling. Hsp90 is a critical signaling hub in the etiopathogenesis of urothelial
carcinoma. Hsp90 clients include tumor suppressors, oncogenes, growth factors, cell cycle regulators, histone modifying enzymes, and
signal transducers [21, 49–55, 57, 58, 60–62]. All of the listed genes are subject to mutation, gene amplification, or deletion in urothelial
carcinoma and are Hsp90 client proteins.

P16 (CDKN2) is a tumor suppressor gene encoded
on chromosome 9p21, a region frequently deleted in
urothelial carcinomas. P16 arrests the cell cycle through
inhibition of cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6.
CDK4 and CDK6 (both are Hsp90 clients) phosphorylate
RB to stimulate G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle,
therefore, loss of p16 results in uninhibited cell growth
[73, 74]. Loss of p16 secondary to deletion occurs in
54 percent of urothelial carcinomas. A study of minimally
invasive (T1a) urothelial carcinomas identified that loss
of p16 was associated with a reduction in progressionfree survival, but did not affect recurrence rates. The
loss of p16 was identified as an independent predictor of
tumor progression at a given tumor stage and grade [74].
Unlike invasive urothelial carcinomas, p16INK4a is
over-expressed in urothelial carcinoma in situ, which is
secondary to enhanced Ras/MAPK signaling [75].

PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene that negatively
regulates activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway,
is deficient in over 50 percent of urothelial carcinomas
due to loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Microdeletions
at the 10q23 locus is often the source of PTEN LOH.
Reduced PTEN levels leads to hyperactive Akt through
PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1)-mediated
phosphorylation. Hsp90 stabilizes Akt and under Hsp90
inhibition, Akt is rapidly ubiquitinated, greatly shortening
its half-life (to one-third) within treated cells [56].
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition
There are several signaling pathways that cooperate
to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
in cancer [80]. One of them is the activation of the RasMAPK pathway [18]. A low level of Ras-MAPK activation
is present in non-invasive urothelial carcinomas, while
hyperactivation occurs in high-grade tumors [18]. The RasMAPK pathway is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases,
as well as by fibroblast growth factor signaling. In addition,
Src signaling (c-Src depends on Hsp90 for its maturation)
stimulates EMT through cytoskeletal remodeling and
inhibiting formation of adherens junctions [81].

DNA repair
Cells have evolved DNA repair mechanisms
essential for the removal of damaged DNA caused by
several endogenous (hydrolysis, reactive oxygen species,
alkylation, DNA mismatches, insertions or deletions,
strand breaks) and exogenous (ultraviolet light, ionizing
radiation, chemotherapeutic drugs) sources. As tobacco
smoking is considered a risk factor for bladder cancer
it is also a source of carcinogens that damage DNA in
urothelial cells [76]. Whole-exome sequencing studies
identified somatic mutations in genes related to DNA
repair pathways including P53, KDM6A, ATM, ERCC2,
FANCD2, PALB2, BAP1, BRCA1 and -2) [77, 78].
Interestingly, these mutations seem to be correlated with
recurrence-free survival in patients with muscle invasive
bladder cancer [77]. As more studies identify alterations in
the DNA repair mechanism, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) inhibitors combined with DNA damaging agents
may be a good therapeutic strategy in some patients [78].

Epigenetic control and transcriptional regulation
Reduced histone modification with inactivation of
acetyltransferases, methyltransferases, deubiquitinases,
and demethylating enzymes occurs in 89 percent of
urothelial carcinomas [60]. There are numerous chromatin
modifying or remodeling enzymes subject to frequent
mutations in urothelial carcinoma, which include BAP1,
UTX, MLL, NCOR1, ARID1A, CHD1 and 6, CREBBp,
EP300, and the SWI/SNF complex [78, 82]. Mutation
causes inactivation of chromatin modifying enzymes in
over 60 percent of urothelial carcinomas, with the most
common mutations within members of the SWI/SNF
complex [60]. The SWI/SNF complex maintains an
environment of tumor suppression, and is frequently lost
in urothelial carcinomas [83, 84].

PI3K-Akt-mTOR activation
Activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)Akt-mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway
occurs in urothelial carcinomas, particularly in muscleinvasive tumors. Its activation is associated with reduced
survival and tumor progression [79]. This usually occurs
secondary to PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog)
deletion, which results in increased activation of Akt
by uninhibited PI3K activity. Akt activation results in
mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2) activation and subsequent
changes in cytoskeletal dynamics. It also promotes
mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) activation through
inhibition of a negative regulator, the tuberous sclerosis
complex (TSC1 and TSC2). TSC1/TSC2 complex inhibits
Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) GTPase, which
activates mTORC1. mTORC1 stimulates cellular growth
through regulation of protein translation by its targets S6
kinase and 4E-BP1. Akt, which activates both mTORC1
and 2, is an Hsp90 client [56].

Current and investigational treatments for
urothelial carcinoma
Treatment of metastatic urothelial carcinoma
remains a major challenge, with no improvement in
overall survival achieved in the past 20 years [85].
Patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma have a poor
overall survival of less than 30 percent at 5 years postdiagnosis [86]. Yet, chemotherapy still provides benefit
over cystectomy, alone [87, 88]. Generally, 70 percent of
patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma respond to
systemic chemotherapy, however more than 90 percent of
them relapse and eventually die from the disease [89].
Although several molecular targeted therapies
for urothelial carcinoma are under investigation, no
new agents have been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in the past 3 decades. The only

FDA approved therapies to date for muscle invasive

and gemcitabine hydrochloride, all of which are cytotoxic

are primarily treated with transurethral resection and
intravesical therapies.

hepatotoxicity that can lead to liver failure, renal
toxicity and hemolytic-uremic syndrome and infections
[101, 102].
One of the most commonly used combination
regimens for advanced bladder cancer, includes
methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin,
only leads to a complete response in 1 of 4 patients
[103]. Cisplatin is a chemotherapy agent that binds to
purine DNA bases causing cross-linking and triggering
DNA damage response [104]. Overcoming the DNA
damage response can lead to drug resistance [104, 105].
This high rate of treatment failure has been attributed, in
part, to the development of cisplatin resistance, which
occurs through multiple mechanisms, such as reduced
cisplatin binding to DNA (pre-target resistance), reduced
formation of DNA-cisplatin adducts (on-target resistance),
altered DNA damage response (post-target resistance),
and influenced signaling pathways that reduce the DNA
damage response (off-target resistance) [104, 106]. More
recently, Choi et  al. identified a p53-like subtype of
invasive bladder cancer associated with cisplatin-based
chemotherapy resistance to apoptosis [107]. In addition
to resistance, many patients with urothelial carcinoma
have impaired renal function, and cisplatin is nephrotoxic
[108]. Therefore, individuals with impaired renal function
are not candidates for cisplatin treatment [109]. Given the
resistance and toxicity of cisplatin, alternative strategies to
sensitize bladder cancer cells to chemotherapy and allow
decreased dose of cisplatin, while increasing the response
and durability, are being explored.
Several clinical trials are ongoing for the treatment of
advanced, unresectable, or metastatic urothelial carcinoma
(Table 1). These include new chemotherapeutics targeting
the DNA damage response or histone deacetylases,

Intravesical therapies
Currently, there are several intravesical therapies
for the treatment of non-invasive urothelial carcinomas,
including Mitomycin C, epirubicin, doxorubicin, and
instillation of live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis bacillus
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) [90]. BCG reduces the risk of
progression and recurrence and is used to treat patients
with carcinoma in situ as well as non-invasive urothelial
carcinomas (T1a tumors) [91–96]. Despite the success of
intravesical treatments, disease progression and recurrence
are common, with a lifetime recurrence risk of 88 percent in
some studies [97]. Additionally, with the need for frequent
surveillance, repeat biopsies, treatment of recurrence,
and management of complications, the costs associated
with treatment of urothelial carcinoma is very high, often
exceeding $150, 000 over the patient’s lifetime [6].
Chemotherapies
The alkylating agent cisplatin, the topoisomerase
II inhibitor, doxorubicin hydrochloride and the
nucleoside analog gemcitabine hydrochloride, all are
non-specific blockers of DNA synthesis in proliferating
cells [98–100]. There are many toxicities associated
with these drugs, which include but are not limited to
bone marrow suppression with pancytopenia, peripheral
edema and capillary leak syndrome, pulmonary toxicity
including respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary
fibrosis, gastrointestinal toxicities with weight loss,

growth-inhibitory and anti-invasive effect in urothelial
carcinoma cell lines [120]. However, gefitinib demonstrated
minimal anti-tumor activity in patients with metastatic
urothelial carcinoma in patients with prior chemotherapy
and is ineffective as a second-line agent for urothelial
carcinoma or in combination therapy with cisplatin and
gemcitabine  [121]. Dovitinib (TKI258) is another TKI
with promising pre-clinical data, significantly retarding
the growth of bladder tumor xenografts in vitro and
in vivo [122], however, it had limited single agent activity
in previously treated muscle invasive bladder cancer
patients in a phase II clinical study [123]. Lapatinib is a TKI
with dual targeting of EGFR and ERBB2, most suitable
for metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients with EGFR
or ERBB2-overexpressing tumors [124], and can be used
post-chemotherapy or in chemoresistant patients [121].

New chemotherapies
Additional chemotherapies under early stage
investigation for urothelial carcinoma include the
combination
of
5-fluoro-2′-deoxycytidine
and
tetrahydrouridine (antimetabolites), eribulin mesylate
(an inhibitor of microtubule dynamics), veliparib (an
inhibitor of PARP 1 and 2, which prevents DNA repair
within cancer cells to enhance chemoradiosensitivity),
and ropidepsin (a histone deacetylase inhibitor). As
many bladder cancer tumors possess cells with somatic
mutations in genes associated with DNA repair, they
should be especially sensitive to chemotherapeutic drugs
that promote DNA damage [78]. Chemotherapy remains
the first-line therapy for metastatic urothelial carcinoma,
but several factors make some patients poor treatment
candidates, including poor performance status, renal
insufficiency, neuropathy, ototoxicity, and heart failure
(New York Heart Association grade 3 and above) [113].

Angiogenesis inhibitors
Anti-angiogenic therapies include bevacizumab,
aflibercept, lenalidomide, and the anti-angiogenic TKIs
(cabozantinib, pazopanib, and sorafenib). Bevacizumab
is used in conjunction with cisplatin and gemcitabine as
a first-line treatment for metastatic urothelial carcinoma.
A  recent phase II clinical trial showed an increase
in overall survival and had an acceptable toxicity
profile  [125]. A phase III study is currently ongoing
(Gemcitabine Hydrochloride and Cisplatin With or
Without Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Advanced
Urinary Tract Cancer (NCT00942331)). Another antiangiogenic therapy, Aflibercept, is a human recombinant
fusion protein that acts as a soluble decoy receptor, also
known as a “VEGF Trap” [126]. It contains vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor-1 and 2 (VEGFR-1
and 2) fused to the Fc fragment of IgG1, which inhibits
VEGF signaling. Aflibercept fusion protein is used after
platinum-based chemotherapy, and has limited singleagent activity, based on a phase II clinical study [126].

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) evaluated in
clinical studies for urothelial carcinoma include afatinib,
erlotinib, dovitinib, sunitinib, gefitinib, pazopanib, and
sorafenib. Erlotinib primarily targets the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), and was shown to have optimal
use in the neoadjuvant setting, resulting in downstaging
of the tumor prior to surgery [114]. Sunitinib is an oral,
small-molecule, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
with significant activity against VEGFR, PDGFR, stem
cell factor receptor, fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) and
the tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the RET protooncogene. A double-blind, randomized, phase 2 trial of
maintenance sunitinib versus placebo was tested in MIBC
patients who have previously undergone chemotherapy,
and was found to have anti-tumor activity [115], however
maintenance sunitinib did not appear to improve the
6-month progression rate [116], therefore, it is not an
ideal second-line option for patients unable to tolerate
cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens [113]. Sorafenib
is an oral, multi-kinase inhibitor which blocks tumor
cell proliferation by targeting the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway
at the level of Raf kinase, and blocks angiogenesis by
targeting the VEGFR and PDGFR families. It was found
to have insufficient activity as a first-line treatment for
advanced urothelial carcinoma [117]. Pazopanib is an
oral multi-kinase angiogenesis inhibitor that targets
VEGFR, PDGFR and stem cell receptor factor. Synergistic
efficacy of pazopanib with docetaxel was demonstrated in

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HER-2 blockade
Expression of the HER-2/neu oncogene is
associated with tumor invasion and metastatic potential
and is expressed on 28 percent of urothelial carcinomas
overall, and greater than 50 percent of muscle-invasive
tumors [127]. Lapatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, elicits
dual blockade of EGFR and HER-2/neu [128]. Although
both of these targets are over-expressed on urothelial
carcinomas and play pathogenic roles, treatment with
lapatinib as a second-line therapy for metastatic urothelial
carcinoma in combination with paclitaxel was poorlytolerated [129].

superoxide, and free radical oxygen, promoting oxidative
stress within urothelial carcinoma cells [139]. Oxidative
stress promotes DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, which
leads to tumor cell death and release of the “danger signal”
HMGB1 (high-mobility group protein  1) that stimulates
the innate immune response [140]. AdCD40L adenoviral
vaccine is used to upregulate CD40 ligand to improve antitumor immune responses as a neoadjuvant treatment for
muscle invasive bladder cancer undergoing cystectomy,
and has successful gene transfer causing enhanced immune
activation [141]. A completed phase I/II trial demonstrated
safety and induction of an immune response (identified
by increased numbers of IFNγ-producing T lymphocytes)
[141], and is currently under evaluation in a larger phase
II trial for evaluation of efficacy. NY-ESO-1 vaccine,
in conjunction with BCG and sargramostim is under
investigation in muscle invasive bladder cancer patients
post-cystectomy that have tumors that express NY-ESO-1 or
LAGE-1 antigens (expressed in nearly 50 percent of muscle
invasive bladder cancers) [142]. Immune responses against
these antigens were present in patients having received the
vaccination for advanced urothelial carcinoma [143]. CDX1307, a monoclonal antibody that targets the mannose
receptor and beta-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin),
is also under evaluation in clinical trials [144]. Increased
numbers of CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes infiltrating the
tumor is associated with beneficial anti-tumor immune
responses and serves as a good prognostic indicator [145].
These current and investigational treatments for urothelial
carcinoma are summarized in Table 2.

Inhibitors of the mTOR have demonstrated
anti-tumor activity alone and in combination with
chemotherapy, as mTOR inhibition enhances
chemosensitivity of urothelial carcinoma cells [130].
mTOR inhibitors induce cell cycle arrest at the G0 to
G1 growth phase and inhibit VEGF production [131].
Everolimus (also known as RAD001) has synergistic
activity with cisplatin, and provides anti-tumor activity
in a subset of patients with muscle invasive bladder
cancer [132, 133]. Everolimus evoked an anti-angiogenic
response, but requires functional PTEN, as PTEN loss
was associated with resistance to everolimus and other
mTOR inhibitors [134, 135]. Long-term rapamycin (also
known as Sirolimus) treatment reduced the incidence of
urothelial carcinoma in renal transplant recipients [136],
who are at increased risk of malignancy due to a reduced
ability to elicit anti-tumor immune responses, however
the protection against incidence and recurrence was not
100 percent [137]. Temsirolimus was tested in a phase II
clinical trial after failure of platinum based therapy for
muscle invasive bladder cancer, but yielded poor treatment
responses [138].
Immunotherapies
Immunotherapies for urothelial carcinoma include
instillation of live but attenuated BCG, dendritic cell-based
vaccines, recombinant IL-7, and recombinant IL-2 fusion
protein. These are all aimed at improving anti-tumor immune
responses. BCG elicits production of hydrogen peroxide,

Hsp90 also inhibits pathways involved in tumor invasion
and metastasis, by affecting cellular migration and
angiogenesis [150]. For instance, Hsp90 blockade by
geldanamycin in bladder cancer cells was shown to
inhibit signaling by the hepatocyte growth factor and
its target oncogene c-Met, which participates in tumor
cell migration by disruption of extracellular matrix
components [150]. Over-expression of c-Met is associated
with poor prognosis in urothelial carcinoma and can be
blocked by Hsp90 inhibitors [151, 152]. Hsp90 inhibition
also inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor signaling, another
factor associated with poor prognosis in urothelial
carcinoma due to induction of angiogenesis promoted by
vascular endothelial growth factor signaling [153, 154].
In urothelial carcinoma, no distinct correlation exists
between Hsp90 protein levels and grade or pathologic
stage of the cancer [155, 156], yet its inhibition results
in destabilization of ErbB2, NF-κB, and phosphorylated
Akt [157]. These proteins are Hsp90 clients [158, 159], and
their collective inhibition prevents the usual deregulated
cell growth and desensitization to pro-apoptotic signals
[160, 161].
More recently, bladder cancer cell lines with
FGFR3 somatic mutation, FGFR3-TACC3 and FGFR3BAI1AP2L1 gene fusions were all found to be sensitive

One promising target to enhance clinical responses
is treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors. There are currently
sixteen Hsp90 inhibitors evaluated in clinical trials for
numerous hematopoietic and solid malignancies [22].
These include melanoma, small cell lung cancer, non-small
cell lung cancer, breast cancer, gastrointestinal stromal
tumor, gastric cancer, colon adenocarcinoma, ovarian
cancer, primary peritoneal cancer in women, fallopian tube
cancer, prostate adenocarcinoma, leukemia, lymphoma,
myeloproliferative disorders, and myelodysplastic
syndromes [146–148]. Several Hsp90 inhibitors have
demonstrated safety, while the second generation Hsp90
inhibitor, ganetespib, is currently in phase III clinical trials
(for non-small cell lung cancer) and already has shown
manageable side-effects in phase II clinical trials [149].
We do not expect that molecular targeted therapy will
replace current treatments for urothelial carcinoma,
rather it may be used adjunctively with other therapies to
heighten the clinical response and reduce residual disease
or recurrence.
As numerous client proteins participate directly in
the pathogenesis of urothelial carcinoma, Hsp90 could
be an ideal target [21] (Figures 1 and 3). Targeting

providing synergism with radiation therapy [169, 170].
Radiation therapy is used adjunctively with multi-agent
chemotherapy regimens in bladder-sparing protocols and
in those with muscle-invasive disease [171] and, thus,
Hsp90 inhibitors may provide added benefit. In acting
synergistically with chemotherapy, Hsp90 inhibitors
may provide an alternative to adjunctive radiotherapy
and may reduce morbidities, as a standard radiation dose
(54 – 64 Gray) promotes radiation cystitis [161].
Therefore, Hsp90 inhibitors can sensitize tumor
cells to chemotherapy or radiotherapy [172, 173].
They can also provide anti-tumorigenic defense
at low non-cytocidal doses when combined with
chemoradiation [174]. CD44-expressing tumor-initiating
cells in bladder cancer have been found to confer
resistance to cisplatin compared to CD44- negative
cells [174]. Combination of Hsp90 inhibition and
chemoradiotherapy potentiated significant apoptosis of
Grade III T24 bladder cancer cells compared to cells
received single treatments. This elevated sensitization
by 17-AAG may overcome cisplatin resistance
[161, 174]. One mechanism of chemoradiosensitization
by Hsp90 inhibitors is through  reducing expression of
the oncoproteins ErbB2 and NF-kB as they participate
in resistance to chemoradiotherapy [175] and are Hsp90
clients [21].

to Hsp90 inhibition. Urothelial carcinoma cells with
FGFR3 mutations that are insensitive to pan-FGFR
inhibitors (those containing the FGFR3S249C or FGFR3Y375C
mutations) were found to be sensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors
[162]. While both ganetespib and an FGFR inhibitor
promoted regression of bladder cancer xenografts
harboring the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion, combination of the
two agents led to a further, significant reduction in tumor
volume [162]. Thus, the use of HSP90 inhibitors alone
or in combination with targeted therapies may serve as
a therapeutic strategy for genetically defined bladder
cancers.

The effects of Hsp90 inhibitors in combination
with chemotherapy in treating urothelial
carcinoma
In the etiopathogenesis of bladder cancer and other
solid tumors, there is increased expression of Hsp90
[163]. Hsp90 inhibition alone has cytostatic effects in
bladder cancer cell lines in vitro and it also provides
synergistic effects with various chemotherapy drugs
[160], including those used in the clinic for urothelial
carcinoma treatment. Treatment of head and neck cancer
cells with Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG was shown to activate
apoptosis by restoring wild type p53 function through the
disruption of p53 interaction with its negative regulator
murine double minute proteins X (MDMX) [164]. When
cells were treated with a combination of Hsp90 inhibitor
17-AAG and cisplatin there was a more prominent
apoptotic effect in vitro, tumor growth inhibition in vivo
and restoration of wild type p53 levels. Hsp90 inhibitors
provide synergism with cisplatin, and likewise, cisplatin
improves clinical responses to Hsp90 inhibitors by
preventing the  compensatory heat shock response due
to Hsp90  inhibition [165]. The first generation Hsp90
inhibitor 17-AAG was found to have synergistic antitumor activity when combined with cisplatin and/or
gemcitabine in treating refractory and metastatic solid
tumors, including urothelial carcinoma in patients with
unresectable or metastatic disease [166]. However, the
ability to escalate the dose of 17-AAG when used with
chemotherapy drugs was limited, due to hematologic
toxicities [166]. Second generation Hsp90 inhibitor
ganetespib potentiated the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin
and improved shrinkage of metastatic lesions when used
in combination therapy in a study of triple negative breast
cancer [167]. This could be due to induction of DNA
damage, resulting in mitotic arrest and enhanced apoptosis
in cancer cells. Thus, Hsp90 inhibitors have been
investigated in combinatorial use for all current FDAapproved treatments for urothelial carcinoma and show
promise, as they provide synergy with chemotherapy.
Hsp90 inhibitors are also radio-sensitizing compounds
[101, 168]. They prevent DNA damage response after
exposure to radiation to induce apoptosis in treated cells,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Resistance to Hsp90 inhibitors
Hsp90 inhibition activates the heat shock response,
which has been shown to limit efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors
in cancer therapy [176–179]. Of note, Hsp27, 40, and
70 are upregulated when Hsp90 is inhibited [180]. Hsp27
prevents protein aggregation of Hsp90 client proteins;
Hsp40 acts as an ATPase modulator for both Hsp90 and
Hsp70 [180, 181]. Blocking the compensatory heat shock
response by Hsp27, 40, and 70 can reduce resistance to
Hsp90 inhibitors [180]. Increased expression of heat
shock proteins in urothelial carcinoma is associated
with poor prognosis and treatment resistance [20, 182].
Multi-targeted Hsp inhibition increases apoptosis, induces
G2/M cell cycle arrest, and inhibits autophagy in cancer
cells [160, 179, 183]. Inhibition of mTOR inhibits
upregulation of heat shock factor (HSF) in response to
Hsp90 inhibition, and would also serve as a means to
reduce resistance [184].
Further, it was noted that bladder cancer cell lines
which express UGT1A (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase)
enzymes were insensitive to resorcinol-based HSP90
inhibitors such as ganetespib and NVP-AUY922 (both
UGT1A substrates), but sensitive to the ansamycin-based
HSP90 inhibitors suggesting that intratumoral metabolism
plays a role in drug resistance. Thus, UGT1A expression
in bladder cancer may represent a predictive biomarker for
what appears to be the most clinically advanced HSP90
inhibitors [162].

Oncotarget

Hsp90 has a second drug-binding site in the
C-domain [185] and coumarin derivative antibiotics
target this site without activating HSF [186, 187].
This is unlike the effect linked to the Hsp90 N-domain
inhibitors. Existing data strongly supports further
medicinal chemistry optimization and preclinical
evaluation of C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors in urothelial
carcinoma [188].
In summary, HSP90 inhibition provides novel
opportunities for targeting common pathways evolved in
urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, increasing sensitivities
to known chemotherapeutic agents, and potentially
optimizing sensitivity to radiation therapy.

CONCLUSION
Urothelial carcinoma is driven largely by loss of
the tumor suppressor genes p53, PTEN, RB, and p16,
requiring restoration of loss of function versus gain
of function, which can more easily be targeted. There
are also limited options available for patients with
advanced disease who progress on or are ineligible for
chemotherapy, resulting in poor outcomes. Our increased
understanding of tumor biology and molecular pathways
involved in urothelial carcinoma has allowed us to explore
unique treatment targets. The inhibitors of the molecular
chaperone Hsp90 have shown promise in clinical trials
for other epithelial malignancies. Combination of Hsp90
inhibitors with chemotherapeutic agents provides better
response rates in urothelial carcinoma in vitro. Further
studies with new-generation Hsp90 inhibitors in the
treatment of urothelial carcinomas will unravel the optimal
combinational therapy, with a possible decrease in drug
resistance. This may ultimately provide a long-term
survival benefit and disease remission.
