Abstract
Human polynucleotide kinase (hPNK) is a bifunctional enzyme
possessing a 5¶-DNA kinase activity and a 3¶-phosphatase
activity. Studies based on cell extracts and purified proteins
have indicated that hPNK can act on single-strand breaks
and double-strand breaks (DSB) to restore the termini to
the chemical form required for further action by DNA repair
polymerases and ligases (i.e., 5¶-phosphate and 3¶-hydroxyl
termini). These studies have revealed that hPNK can bind to
XRCC4, and as a result, hPNK has been implicated as a
participant in the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)
pathway for DSB repair. We sought to confirm the role
of hPNK in NHEJ in the cellular setting using a genetic
approach. hPNK was stably down-regulated by RNA interference expression in M059K glioblastoma cells, which are NHEJ
positive, and M059J cells, which are NHEJ deficient due to a
lack of DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). Whereas
depletion of hPNK significantly sensitized M059K cells to
ionizing radiation, no additional sensitization was conferred
to M059J cells, clearly implying that hPNK operates in the
same DNA repair pathway as DNA-PKcs. On the other hand,
depletion of hPNK did not increase the level of sister
chromatid exchanges, indicating that hPNK is not involved
in the homologous recombination DSB repair pathway. We
also provide evidence that the action of hPNK in the repair of
camptothecin-induced topoisomerase 1 ‘‘dead-end’’ complexes is independent of DNA-PKcs and that hPNK is not
involved in the nucleotide excision repair pathway. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Strand breaks constitute a significant proportion of the lesions
generated by a broad range of genotoxic agents, either directly or
during the course of DNA repair. Most of the termini carry
chemical modifications that require processing before further
repair can proceed. All 3¶-strand termini have to be restored to
hydroxyl groups and 5¶-termini to phosphate groups, to allow DNA
polymerases and ligases to catalyze repair synthesis and strand
rejoining. Human polynucleotide kinase (hPNK) is a bifunctional
enzyme mediating the correction of these strand-break termini by
its 5¶-kinase and 3¶-phosphatase activities (1, 2).

In vitro studies have provided evidence that hPNK is involved in
single-strand break (SSB) and base excision repair (3–6) and in
double-strand break (DSB) repair through nonhomologous end
joining (NHEJ; refs. 7, 8) and a newly described XRCC1/DNA ligase
III–dependent DSB repair pathway (9, 10). In their study, Chappell
et al. (7) used an assay for NHEJ, which monitors end-to-end
ligation of restriction enzyme-cleaved DNA by human cell extracts.
Plasmid DNA substrates lacking a 5¶-phosphate failed to undergo
ligation when treated with extract immunodepleted for hPNK. This
study also indicated that the 5¶-phosphorylation was dependent on
XRCC4, an observation substantiated by Koch et al. (8), who
provided evidence for physical association between hPNK and
XRCC4 phosphorylated at Thr233. Audebert et al. (10) similarly
made use of synthetic substrates, in this case, short doublestranded oligonucleotides, to monitor ligation catalyzed by cell-free
extracts.
The importance of eukaryotic PNK in the cellular response to
genotoxic agents was initially established in Schizosaccharomyces
pombe (11). Deletion of PNK in fission yeast resulted in cellular
hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor. Both of these agents are capable of
generating DNA SSB and DSB with termini requiring either or
both PNK activities (12–15). RNA interference (RNAi) silencing of
hPNK in A549 human lung carcinoma cells yielded a similar
response to that seen in yeast (16). The cells displayed an increased
sensitivity to ionizing radiation and camptothecin, as well as a
significantly elevated spontaneous mutation frequency, suggesting
that hPNK plays important roles countering exogenous and
endogenous DNA damage and helping to maintain genomic
stability.
Because DSBs are considered to contribute significantly toward
cell lethality induced by ionizing radiation and genomic instability,
we sought direct cell-based evidence for involvement of hPNK in
DSB repair, particularly the NHEJ pathway, by comparing the
influence of hPNK down-regulation on the radiation response of
NHEJ-proficient and NHEJ-deficient cells. NHEJ is a multienzymatic pathway initially involving damage recognition by binding
of the Ku70/80 heterodimer followed by attachment of the DNAPK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). This complex then recruits
XRCC4, XLF, and DNA ligase IV to complete strand rejoining
(17, 18). The requirement of other processing enzymes, such as
hPNK and DNA polymerases E and A, has been implicated from
experiments with purified proteins or cell extracts (7, 8, 19), but
not fully confirmed with intact cells. To investigate the involvement of hPNK in the NHEJ repair pathway, we stably downregulated hPNK in the DNA-PKcs–deficient human glioma cell
line M059J and the NHEJ-proficient cell line M059K isolated from
the same glioma (20, 21).

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions. The isolation and characterization of
the M059K and M059J glioma cell lines and the hPNK-depleted A549 human
lung adenocarcinoma cell line have been described previously (16, 20, 21).
Parental A549 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. The cells were cultured in DMEM/nutrient mixture F-12
(DMEM/F-12; 1:1 ratio) supplemented with 10% FCS, 50 units/mL penicillin,
50 Ag/mL streptomycin, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 0.1 mmol/L nonessential
amino acids, and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate and maintained at 37jC under
5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. All culture supplies were purchased from
Invitrogen.
Transfection procedure. The construction of the pSUPER plasmid (22)
containing a duplex directed against a 20-base sequence in the hPNK mRNA
has been described previously (16). M059J and M059K cells were plated in
60-mm dishes. When they reached 50% to 70% confluency, the cells were
cotransfected with 2.4 Ag pSUPER [with or without inserted small
interfering RNA (siRNA) sequence] and 0.5 Ag pGFPneo plasmid DNA and

with 10 AL Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) diluted in 600 AL serum- and
antibiotic-free DMEM. After incubation at 37jC for 24 h, cells were
trypsinized and further cultured at a 1:10 dilution in complete medium. The
following day, medium was replaced with selective medium containing
300 Ag/mL G418 (Invitrogen) and the cells were grown in this medium for
2 weeks. G418-resistant colonies were established in six-well plates, expanded,
and cloned independently.
Immunofluorescence detection of hPNK. Approximately 105 cells were
seeded on a glass coverslip and incubated overnight at 37jC in a CO2
incubator. On the next day, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for
20 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with
100% cold methanol at 20jC for 30 min. The cells were then blocked with
5% milk powder in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Monoclonal antibody
(mAb) to hPNK (Cytostore), diluted 250-fold in 5% milk powder, was placed
on the coverslips and incubated for 1 h. After washing the slides several
times with PBS and PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the cells were incubated
with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Molecular
Probes) diluted 1:500 in PBS for 1 h in the dark. Cells were again washed

twice with PBS and PBS-Tween 20 and finally rinsed with water. The
coverslips were mounted on a microscope slide using 95% glycerol in PBS
containing 3 Ag/mL 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and viewed with
a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss International) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 100M microscope.
Enzyme activity. Both kinase and phosphatase activity were measured
as described earlier (2, 16). Briefly, for kinase activity, 10 AL crude cell lysate
was tested for the transfer of phosphate from [g-32P]ATP to the 5¶-OH of a
21-mer oligonucleotide substrate. Phosphatase activity was determined by
the conversion of a 21-mer oligonucleotide (p21p), bearing a 32P label at the
5¶-terminus as well as a 3¶-phosphate, to the 3¶-dephosphorylated 21-mer
(p21). For both activities, reaction was carried out in 70 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.6), 10 mmol/L MgCl2, and 5 mmol/L DTT at 37jC for 30 min.
Preparation of cell-free extract and Western immunoblot analysis.
Cells were trypsinized and a cell pellet was obtained by centrifugation at
1,000 rpm for 10 min at 4jC. The cells were first washed with PBS followed
by resuspension in 10 to 15 mL of low salt buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES,
25 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.1 mmol/L EDTA,
0.1 mmol/L DTT (pH 7.2)] plus protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma; ref. 21).
The cell pellet was resuspended in 2.5 times the packed cell volume,
incubated on ice for 10 min, and either directly used or frozen on dry ice for
long-term storage at 80jC. Aliquots of the cell extracts were quickly
thawed at 37jC and adjusted to 0.5 mol/L NaCl and 10 mmol/L MgCl2 and
incubated on ice for 5 min and then spun at 10,000  g for 3 min at 4jC.
Supernatant was removed and stored in a new tube, whereas the pellet was
reextracted with extraction buffer 1:10 diluted by 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH
7.5; ref. 23).
For Western blotting, 50 Ag protein was applied and run on a 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gel. Presence or absence of the hPNK was determined by a
mouse monocolonal antibody against hPNK (24), probed with the
secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and detected
with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare).
Assessment of clonogenic survival. Cells from exponentially growing
subcultures were seeded in 60-mm culture dishes in DMEM/F-12
supplemented with 10% FCS at densities of 200 to 2,000 cells per dish as
described earlier (16). After overnight incubation at 37jC to allow for cell
attachment, the cells were subjected to g-radiation (60Co Gammacell,
Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd.) or UVC radiation (G15T8 15W germicidal
bulb, General Electric) or exposed to graded doses of camptothecin (Sigma)
for 1 h at 37jC. (For UV exposure, the medium was removed and the cells
were washed with PBS and then drained before irradiation). Drugcontaining medium was then replaced with fresh medium containing 15%
FCS and the plates were incubated for a period of 2 to 3 weeks at 37jC. The
resulting colonies were fixed and stained with 10% methylene blue and
counted. Cell survival was plotted as a function of dose and fitted using
Prism version 3.03 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.).
Monitoring of H2AX phosphorylation. The induction and repair of
DSBs following ionizing radiation was assessed by monitoring the
formation and loss of gH2AX molecules. We followed the modified protocol
of Furuta et al. (25) as described earlier (16). Briefly, for each determination,
1  105 cells were seeded onto a glass coverslip retained in 35-mm dishes
and left overnight at 37jC. On the next day, cells were exposed to 5 Gy
g-radiation and incubated at 37jC for various times up to 24 h. Cells were
probed with a mAb to phosphorylated histone H2AX (Ser139; Upstate) and
subsequently incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary
antibody. The presence of phosphorylated H2AX foci was determined by
Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope and the average
integrated intensity/nucleus was analyzed using Metamorph Offline 6.1
software (Universal Imaging) as described (16).
Sister chromatid exchange. Log-phase cells were incubated with 10 Ag/
mL 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 48 to 72 h at 37jC in DMEM/F-12
supplemented with 20% FCS. For the final 4 h of the incubation, cells were
blocked at mitosis by 0.1 Ag/mL colcemid. The cells were harvested and
fixed in methanol/glacial acetic acid (3:1) and applied to prewashed slides
(26). Differential staining was achieved by immunofluorescence staining. In
this method, sister chromatids are differentially stained by immunostaining
of mitotic chromosomes followed by treatment of cells with antibody

against BrdUrd (Becton Dickson) and Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated
secondary antibody. Coverslips were then mounted on slides by using
mounting solution, 95% glycerol in PBS containing 5 Ag/mL DAPI. Slides
were stored at 4jC in the dark before scoring. At least 30 metaphases were
analyzed by confocal microscopy.

Results and Discussion
siRNA-mediated knockdown of hPNK in M059K and M059J
cells. Stable knockdown of hPNK in the M059 cells was achieved by
expression of a siRNA sequence directed against nucleotides 1391
to 1410 (5¶-AGAGATGACGGACTCCTCT-3¶) of the hPNK cDNA
using the pSUPER vector system (22). We did a series of
experiments to validate the efficiency of our knockdown cell lines,

M059JyPNK and M059KyPNK. Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A),
immunofluorescence (Fig. 1C), and functional kinase and phosphatase assays (Fig. 2A and B) showed a marked reduction in the
expression of hPNK in both cell lines. Biweekly Western blotting of
lysates from cells grown over a 3-month period further indicated
that the knockdown of hPNK was highly stable (data not shown).
Also as a control, we checked the expression of several other DNA
repair proteins (Fig. 1B), including human apurinic/apyrimidinic
endonuclease (Ape1), and did not find any changes in the
expression level of these proteins as a result of hPNK downregulation, implying that enzymes that may act on the same lesions
as hPNK (e.g., the phosphatase activity of Ape1) are not upregulated to compensate for the depletion of hPNK. The reduction
in hPNK expression also had no influence on the DNA repair
transducer protein ATM in either cell line. As noted previously,
the level of ATM expression is lower in M059J cells than M059K
cells (27).
Influence of hPNK depletion on the radiosensitivity of M059J
and M059K cells and DSB repair. To assess the cellular sensitivity
of the M059KyPNK and M059JyPNK cells, we measured their
clonogenic survival in response to ionizing radiation, camptothecin
and UV light. The radiation survival curves (Fig. 3A) revealed that
the M059KyPNK cells were significantly more sensitive than either
the parental M059K cells or the control cells transfected with the
unmodified pSUPER vector (M059KpSup). The f2-fold sensitization was very similar to our previous data obtained with hPNKdepleted A549 cells (16). In contrast, down-regulation of hPNK in
M059J cells did not further sensitize them to ionizing radiation.
The depletion of hPNK in M059K cells did not sensitize the cells to
the same extent as the lack of DNA-PKcs (i.e., the M059J cells).
Several explanations can be put forward for this observation. One
straightforward explanation is that the knockdown of hPNK was
incomplete and the residual enzyme was able to process a
proportion of the strand-break termini. An alternative, equally
plausible, explanation is that not all DSB acted on by DNA-PKcs
require hPNK processing. Irradiation under aerated conditions
generates termini with 3¶-phosphate and 3¶-phosphoglycolate end
groups in approximately similar proportions and only f15% of
5¶-termini lack a 5¶-phosphate group (12–14, 28). Although the
3¶-phosphate termini are extremely poor substrates for Ape1 (6, 29),
Ape1 can remove a significant proportion of phosphoglycolate
groups, especially from 3¶-recessed termini (30–32), although
phosphoglycolates at 3¶-overhanging termini require another
processing pathway involving hPNK (33).
To determine the relationship between clonogenic survival and
DNA repair, we examined DSB repair by measuring the formation
and disappearance of phosphorylated histone H2AX (gH2AX)
in these cell lines following exposure to 5 Gy g-radiation. The
results, shown in Fig. 3B, indicate that the reduction of hPNK
expression in M059K cells led to elevated and more prolonged
H2AX phosphorylation. Even by 24 h, the level of gH2AX had not
quite returned to background in the M059KyPNK cells. Nonetheless, the level was not as high or prolonged as that seen with the
M059J cells, presumably due to the lack of DNA-PKcs in the latter
cells (34). Furthermore, hPNK down-regulation did not significantly alter the gH2AX profile in the M059J cells. Thus, the DSB
repair profile seen with the four cell lines correlates well with the
survival data.
Influence of hPNK depletion on homologous recombination.
The data above confirm an important role for hPNK in NHEJ. To
ascertain the effect of hPNK depletion on an alternative major

Role of hPNK in DNA Repair

3¶-dephosphorylation and 5¶-phosphorylation by hPNK (41, 42). The
influence of the reduction of hPNK on cytotoxicity after exposure
to the low doses of camptothecin (<0.5–1 Amol/L) is less clear.
Together with our previous data obtained with hPNK-depleted
A549 cells (16), it seems that the influence is minimal. Others have
linked sensitivity to low doses of camptothecin to heightened
sensitivity of cells in S phase (43) and have provided evidence that
camptothecin-induced DSBs resulting from stalled replication
forks are resolved by homologous recombination (39, 44).
PNK is not involved in nucleotide excision repair. As we have
noted previously, reduced expression of hPNK sensitized A549 cells
to UV light, most notably at high doses (Fig. 5A). We have proposed
that the increased sensitivity to UV afforded by hPNK depletion
arises from UV-induced strand breakage rather than participation
of hPNK in nucleotide excision repair (NER) of UV base damage,
such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or 6,4-photoproducts. It
has been determined that exposure of P3 teratocarcinoma cells to
10 J/m2 introduces f140 SSBs per cell compared with f840 SSBs
induced by 1 Gy X-rays (45), and DSBs have also been observed

pathway for DSB, homologous recombination, we analyzed the
formation of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) following irradiation (35). Because we were unable to obtain chromosome spreads
from M059J and M059K cells of sufficient quality to quantify SCEs,
we used A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells and the hPNKdepleted A549 cells (C-ter3) described previously (16). Figure 3C
indicates that the increase in the level of SCE following 2.5 and 5 Gy
irradiation was almost identical in the wild-type (WT) A549 and Cter3 cells, implying that hPNK is not required for homologous
recombination and that the processing of strand-break termini in
this repair pathway is handled by a different set of enzymes
including exonucleases and endonucleases, such as the WRN
helicase/nuclease and Mre11 exonuclease (36, 37).
Influence of hPNK and DNA-PKcs depletion on the response
to camptothecin. As shown in Fig. 4, the response pattern of
M059JyPNK and M059KyPNK cells and their respective parental
cells toward camptothecin differed from the response pattern seen
with radiation. The difference in sensitivity to this agent between
the two parental cell lines was modest compared with their
responses to ionizing radiation, indicating that the role of the NHEJ
pathway is less critical to the survival of these cells following
exposure to this topoisomerase I inhibitor. These data agree well
with those of Shao et al. (38), who also examined the influence of
camptothecin on M059J and M059K cells, and are qualitatively
similar to those obtained with V79 hamster cells and a NHEJdeficient variant V3-3 (39), showing a slightly elevated sensitivity to
camptothecin in the V3-3 cells. On the other hand, Adachi et al.
(40) found that DT40 chicken cells lacking NHEJ proteins (Ku70 or
DNA-PKcs) displayed considerable resistance to camptothecin
compared with WT DT40 cells. This dichotomy still needs to be
resolved. The loss of hPNK markedly sensitized both M059J and
M059K, especially to the higher doses of camptothecin. This
reflects the fact that the repair of a significant proportion of,
though not all, camptothecin-induced topoisomerase 1-DNA
‘‘dead-end’’ complexes is mediated by DNA-protein hydrolysis
catalyzed by tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (Tdp1) followed by

following UV irradiation with 10 J/m2 (46). On the other hand, Koch
et al. (8) reported an interaction between the forkhead-associated
domain of hPNK and DDB1, a component of the DNA damage
binding complex involved in NER (47). To investigate the potential
involvement of hPNK in NER, we compared the survival of A549
and C-ter3 cells after incubation with cisplatin. This agent
produces cisplatin DNA adducts that are primarily repaired by
NER (48) and few, if any, direct strand breaks (49, 50). The survival
curves (Fig. 5B) of the two cell lines are almost identical, clearly
ruling out any contribution of hPNK activity in NER and adding to
the likelihood that UV-induced strand breaks are responsible for
the sensitization resulting from the hPNK depletion.
In conclusion, the data presented here have further clarified the
contribution of hPNK to the cellular response to ionizing radiation,
camptothecin, UV light, and cisplatin. Together with data obtained
from cell-free systems (7, 8), we have clearly established that hPNK
participates in the NHEJ pathway, presumably processing the
strand break termini before ligation. On the other hand, the SCE
data indicate that the enzyme is not required for homologous
recombination. The experiments presented here were not specifically designed to assess the contribution of hPNK to the XRCC1/
DNA ligase III–dependent NHEJ DSB repair pathway (9, 10). Iliakis
et al. (51, 52) have proposed that this pathway, which does not use
DNA-PK, serves as a backup to the conventional NHEJ pathway.
Although in vitro studies have indicated that M059J cells possess
this repair pathway (51), which may account for a proportion of the
residual DSB repair capacity of these cells, our survival and DSB
repair data (Fig. 3A and B) would suggest that the requirement for
hPNK in this pathway may not be significant. Further studies will
be required to fully establish the role of this backup pathway in the
cellular response to ionizing radiation. It should also be noted that

because hPNK is also involved in the SSB and base excision repair
pathways (4–6), our observation that the depletion of PNK in
M059J cells did not significantly increase the radiosensitivity of
these cells further strengthens the argument that DSBs are the
most important lesions responsible for radiation-induced cytotoxicity (53, 54). (However, such breaks may still arise from the
processing of other types of complex DNA lesions and/or
replication arrest opposite SSBs). Both hPNK and DNA-PKcs play
a role in the repair of camptothecin-induced DNA-topoisomerase I
dead-end complexes, but not necessarily in the same pathway,
because the M059J cells, like the M059K cells, were further
sensitized by hPNK depletion. The involvement of hPNK in the
cellular response to UV light is most likely restricted to the repair
of UV-induced strand breaks with no direct participation in NER, a
point confirmed by the absence of increased sensitization to
cisplatin in hPNK knockdown cells. There is currently increasing
interest in targeting DNA repair enzymes, such as DNA-PK,
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and ATM, for therapeutic advantage
(55). Our findings suggest that hPNK could be a useful target for
potentiating tumor cytotoxicity by ionizing radiation or topoisomerase I inhibitors, but not agents such as cisplatin.
