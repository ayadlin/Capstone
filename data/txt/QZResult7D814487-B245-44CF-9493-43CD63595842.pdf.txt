ABSTRACT
Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive tumor of bone and soft tissue affecting predominantly
children and young adults. Tumor-specific chromosomal translocations create EWS-FLI1
and similar aberrant ETS fusion proteins that drive sarcoma development in patients. ETS
family fusion proteins and over-expressed ETS proteins are also found in acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Transgenic expression
of EWS-FLI1 in mice promotes high penetrance erythroid leukemia with dense hepatic
and splenic infiltrations. We identified a small molecule, YK-4-279, that directly binds to
EWS-FLI1 and inhibits its oncogenic activity in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and xenograft
mouse models. Herein, we tested in vivo therapeutic efficacy and potential side effects
of YK-4-279 in the transgenic mouse model with EWS-FLI1 induced leukemia. A twoweek course of treatment with YK-4-279 significantly reduced white blood cell count,
nucleated erythroblasts in the peripheral blood, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly of
erythroleukemic mice. YK-4-279 inhibited EWS-FLI1 target gene expression in neoplastic
cells. Treated animals showed significantly better overall survival compared to control
mice that rapidly succumbed to leukemia. YK-4-279 treated mice did not show overt
toxicity in liver, spleen, or bone marrow. In conclusion, this in vivo study highlights the
efficacy of YK-4-279 to treat EWS-FLI1 expressing neoplasms and support its therapeutic
potential for patients with Ewing sarcoma and other ETS-driven malignancies.

that occurs in about 95% of cases [1]. EWS is a member of
TET family of RNA binding proteins that is ubiquitously
expressed [2] with proposed functions in transcription [3, 4],
RNA processing [5, 6], and signal transduction [7–9]. On the
other hand, FLI1 is a member of ETS family of transcription

INTRODUCTION
Ewing sarcoma is a neoplasm of the bone and soft
tissue. It is characterized by a pathognomonic chromosomal
translocation involving EWS and FLI1 or related genes

factors that is predominantly expressed during embryonic
development and exclusively in hematopoietic cells in adult
tissues [10]. The translocation leads to juxtaposition of the
amino-terminal portion of EWS with the carboxy-terminus
of FLI1; the fusion protein differs from wild-type proteins
based upon loss of the RNA binding domain of EWS and
transactivational domain of FLI1 [11]. EWS-FLI1 fusion
protein confers its tumorigenic phenotype through aberrant
transcriptional activity [12–15] and splicing [16–20].
EWS-FLI1 can transform NIH-3T3 cells [21],
primary bone marrow derived mesenchymal progenitors
[22], and osteochondrogenic progenitors [23]. In order to
efficiently transform cells, both EWS and FLI1 regions
of the chimeric transcript are required, although deletions
of certain regions modulate its potency [24]. Anti-sense
oligodeoxynucleotide or sequence specific siRNA mediated
knockdown of EWS-FLI1 gene expression is detrimental to
Ewing sarcoma cells [25–28]. These findings highlight the
significance of EWS-FLI1 for initiating and maintaining
tumorigenicity of Ewing sarcoma cells; hence its potential
for targeted therapy. In addition, EWS-FLI1 is exclusively
present in Ewing sarcoma cells, compared to non-tumor
somatic cells, further emphasizing EWS-FLI1 as the ideal
therapeutic target for Ewing sarcoma [29].
We identified a small molecule inhibitor, YK-4-279,
that directly binds to EWS-FLI1 and inhibits its oncogenic
activity in Ewing Sarcoma cell lines and xenograft mouse
models [30–32]. YK-4-279 showed a significant differential
cytotoxicity to cells that harbor EWS-FLI1 compared to those
cells that do not, confirming the specificity of this molecule
[30, 31]. YK-4-279 blocks specific protein interactions with
EWS-FLI1 including DDX5 and RHA leading to altered
mRNA splicing [19] as well as transcription [30, 31]. YK-4279 can also block growth of other ETS driven cancers. YK-4279 inhibited ERG and ETV1 derived malignant phenotypes
in prostate cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo [33, 34].
Uncertainty about the exact cell type that gives rise
to Ewing sarcoma contributes to the lack of in vivo models
for the disease, which has hindered preclinical study efforts.
Torchia et al have generated a double transgenic mouse
model (referred hereafter as E/F; Mx1-cre) where expression
of EWS-FLI1 was targeted to the bone marrow, spleen,
and liver. This targeted expression resulted from breeding
Rosa26-loxP-stop-loxP-EWS-FLI1 (E/F) mice with animals
that expressed cre recombinase under the pIpC responsive
Mx1-promoter (Mx1-cre) [35]. Expression of EWS-FLI1
in these tissues induced expansion of primitive erythroid/
myeloid progenitors leading to rapid leukemia development
that caused severe hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia,
and 90% mortality within 28 days [35].
Here, we tested the efficacy of YK-4-279 in
disrupting the oncogenic activity of EWS-FLI1 in vivo
using the above model. YK-4-279 treatment inhibited EWSFLI1 target gene expression including Mest, Cpne7, c-Myc,
Gata1, Gata2, and Car8. We showed that short-term YK-4279 treatment led to correction of abnormal hematopoiesis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and improved overall survival in EWS-FLI1+ leukemic mice
without overt side effects. We conclude that direct targeting
of aberrant ETS transcription factors with small molecules
could be of significant therapeutic value in oncology.

RESULTS
EWS-FLI1 expression is induced in E/F;
Mx1-cre transgenic mouse model
In order to confirm that EWS-FLI1 expression is
induced in the E/F; Mx1-cre transgenic mouse model,
protein and RNA was extracted from spleens of wt
(C57BL/6) mice, E/F; control mice (E/F mice that did not
inherit Mx1-cre), and pIpC induced E/F; Mx1-cre mice
and were subjected to western blotting and RT-qPCR,
respectively. The transgene was detected in the spleens
of E/F; Mx1-cre mice verifying that the E/F; Mx1-cre
transgenic mouse model expresses the therapeutic target of
interest (Figures 1A and 1B). EWS-FLI1 was not detected
at either mRNA or protein level in wt mice. EWS-FLI1
mRNA level in E/F; control mice was 564 fold over
wt mice (Figure 1A). This could be due to a leaky read
through transcription. However, the expression was not
enough to make a detectable protein (Figure 1B). It is
possible that the protein level may have been below the
detection limit of the technique or the antibody used.
Regardless, the leaky expression observed in E/F; control
mice was not biologically significant since these mice did
not develop leukemia over one year follow up.

CD43+, CD71+, CD117+, CD45−, cells are enriched
in the spleens and peripheral blood of mice with
EWS-FLI1 induced leukemia
Malignant cells of E/F; Mx1-cre mice co-express
CD43, CD71, and CD117, but do not express CD45 or
CD34 [35]. CD43 (leukosialin) is expressed in early
hematopoietic progenitors including those of erythroid
lineage that are often CD43+, CD34− and CD45− [36].
CD71 (transferrin receptor) is highly expressed in
immature erythroid cells with the highest levels in early
erythroid precursors through intermediate normoblast
phase [37, 38]. CD117 (c-kit) can differentiate
erythroblasts from other progenitors when used in
combination with other cell surface antigens such as
CD45 and CD71. Cells from the spleen and peripheral
circulation of leukemic E/F; Mx1-cre mice were evaluated
for surface antigen expression and showed a phenotype
of CD43+, CD71+, CD117+, and CD45−. We used this
profile to characterize cells from control mice and pIpC
induced E/F; Mx1-cre mice with late stage leukemia.
Only 0.14% of the splenocytes from E/F; control mice
were CD43+ and CD45− compared to 45.73% in mice with
EWS-FLI1 induced leukemia (Figure 2A). Moreover, only
0.11% of the splenocytes of control mice were CD71+ and

CD71+/CD117+, respectively, compared to 24.57% and

of colony forming cells (CFCs). E/F; control mouse had
an average of 8 CFCs/100,000 cells, while splenocytes of
a littermate mouse with EWS-FLI1 induced leukemia of
the same sex and age had significantly increased CFCs (an
average of 563 CFCs/100,000 cells) suggesting that most of
these CFCs are leukemic progenitors (Figure 3A). Treatment
of CFC cultures with 3 μM or 10 μM YK-4-279 led to 90%
or 99% reduction, respectively, in the clonogenic capacity of
leukemic stem cells of the same mouse. In addition, colonies
from E/F; Mx1-cre mice splenocytes were larger in size than
those of control mice (Figure 3B).

Weekly WBC counts, RBC counts and blood
smears along with post-mortem immunophenotyping
and spleen and liver weights were used to assess disease
burden. Following one week of treatment, a statistically
significant reduction of WBC count occurred in the YK4-279 treatment group vs. control (p < 0.02) (Figure 4A).
The treatment effect was even more pronounced after
two weeks with significant reduction in WBC count
(p < 0.0001) (Figure 4A). Overall, YK-4-279 significantly
lowered the amount of blast cells in the peripheral blood
(Figures 4B and 4C and Figure 5). Following the two
weeks treatment, the average enrichment of erythroblasts
in the peripheral blood as characterized by CD43+/CD45−
and CD71+/CD117+ cells was 15.1% and 13.5% for DMSO
group compared to 6.8% and 6.3% for YK-4-279 treatment
group (Figure 4B and 4C). EWS-FLI1 induced leukemia
is characterized by splenomegaly and hepatomegaly. YK4-279 significantly reduced the spleen and liver weights
of E/F; Mx1-cre mice with EWS-FLI1 induced leukemia
without affecting the total body weight measured at the
time of euthanasia (Figures 4D–4F). Furthermore, YK-4279 treatment rescued the anemic state of the leukemic
mice at late stage (Supplementary Figure S1).
Since Gata1 is one of the most highly up-regulated
genes in erythroblasts of E/F; Mx1-cre animals, Gata1
immunostaining was used as a reliable biomarker in the
leukemia mouse model to trace erythroblasts. Our findings
from IHC staining revealed that Gata1+ erythroblasts were
effectively diminished in liver and spleen upon YK-4279 treatment, but DMSO treated mice had dense hepatic
infiltration of Gata1+ erythroblasts (Figures 6 and 7 and
Supplementary Figure S2). Improved spleen and liver

YK-4-279 significantly reduced disease burden
of E/F; Mx1-cre leukemic mice
We then investigated the effect of YK-4-279 on
disease burden of mice with EWS-FLI1 induced leukemia.
E/F; Mx1-cre mice were injected with 1 mg pIpC at 1
month of age to activate Mx1 promoter. The animals were
followed up with weekly blood analysis for evidence
of disease. Once an increase in white blood cell (WBC)
count to an average of 10,000 cells/μl of blood and a 0.4–
4% enrichment of CD43+, CD71+, CD117+, and CD45−
erythroblasts in the peripheral blood were observed, the
mice were randomly assigned to treatment or control
groups (Day 0) (Figures 4A–4C). Leukemic E/F; Mx1cre mice were treated with once a day intraperitoneal
injections (IP) of YK-4-279 five-times a week for two
weeks at a dose of 200 mg/kg for the first two injections
followed by 150 mg/kg for the remaining injections. The
mice were then euthanized two weeks following the start
of therapy (Day14).

to healthy E/F; control mice to confirm leukemia induction. Mice were assigned to treatment following an average enrichment of CD43+/
CD45− and CD71+/CD117+ WBC to 1.41% and 1.75% compared to 0.02% and 0.19% in E/F; control mice. The amount of erythroblasts in

in mice compared to severe infiltration of erythroid
progenitors in vehicle treated mice.
Evaluation of the bone marrow from E/F; Mx1cre mice showed disease involvement in DMSO treated
group, which had reduced number of megakaryocytes,
granulocytes and erythroid cells compared to normal mice
without the disease (Supplementary Figure S3). We also
observed increased number of immature cells and apoptotic
cells. When the animals were treated with YK-4-279, the
overall morphology of bone marrow showed a significant
shift towards normal. Disease burden in bone marrow
was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry for Gata1
protein. In normal bone marrow, only the erythroid lineage
cells were stained positive for Gata1. EWS-FLI1 induced

leukemia resulted in overpopulation of bone marrow with
Gata1 positive cells, which was significantly reduced in
YK-4-279 treated animals (Supplementary Figure S3).
However, a complete elimination of immature cells and
restoration of normal structures were not observed, which
may explain the disease recurrence following cessation of
YK-4-279 treatment after two weeks.
We measured cleaved caspase 3 as an apoptosis
marker and Ki67 as a proliferation marker. E/F; control
mice without Mx1-Cre served as negative controls in
immunostainings, which did not display any symptoms
of disease or any unusual apoptosis or proliferation. YK4-279 treatment caused little apoptosis in liver or spleen
after two weeks of treatment (Figure 8 and Supplementary

Images of blood smears after one week (middle) and two weeks (right) of treatment with YK-4-279 or vehicle are shown. Induction of

spleens and livers of YK-4-279 treated mice could be due to
a number of reasons. Apoptotic erythroblast infiltrates could
have been efficiently eradicated by tissue macrophages
before the two weeks time point or may have apoptosed
prior to infiltrating the spleen or liver. On the other hand,
YK-4-279 may have induced other form of cell death
that doesn’t involve caspase 3. Alternatively, inhibition
of EWS-FLI1 function with YK-4-279 may have caused
the leukemic cells to differentiate and lose their leukemic
property. YK-4-279 may have also induced cell cycle arrest
instead of apoptosis, which could not have been recognized
by IHC for cleaved caspase 3. We noted a more prominent
cleaved caspase 3 staining in splenic infiltration of DMSO
treated severely diseased mice (Figure 8 and Supplementary
Figure S2). This is indicative of high spontaneous apoptosis
in the leukemic cells that appear quite rapidly in the mice
with dense splenic infiltrations. The lack of cleaved
caspase 3 staining in the normal liver and spleen cells in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

YK-4-279 treated mice suggests the treatment’s minimal
toxicity towards the normal cells. This is consistent with
the finding that the treatment did not cause liver damage
as assessed by serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (Supplementary
Figure S4). Ki67 staining was very prominent in DMSO
treated mice, but YK-4-279 treatment eradicated
erythroblasts in the diffuse hepatic infiltrated areas (Figure
9 and Supplementary Figure S2). The difference was less
pronounced in the spleen where there was still prominent
Ki67 staining in YK-4-279 treated spleens (Figure 9 and
Supplementary Figure S2).

target genes. We investigated the impact of YK-4-279
on transcriptional activity of EWS-FLI1 in E/F; Mx1cre mice. Surprisingly, previously published EWS-FLI1
target genes were unchanged upon EWS-FLI1 activation
in E/F; Mx1-cre mice and the expression profile of EWSFLI1 induced leukemic cells was different from those of
Ewing tumors [35]. EWS-FLI1 may modulate different
sets of genes in different cell types to induce leukemia
vs. sarcoma. Mest (mesoderm specific transcript), Cpne7
(Copine VII), c-Myc, Car8 (Carbonic anahydrase VIII),
Gata1 (GATA binding protein 1), and Gata2 (GATA
binding protein 2) are some of the genes differentially
regulated in cells with activated EWS-FLI1 in the E/F;
Mx1-cre mouse model [35]. Mest, Cpne7, c-Myc, Car8,
Gata1, and Gata2 were upregulated upon induction of
EWS-FLI1 expression in spleens of E/F; Mx1-cre mice
(Figure 10A). YK-4-279 reversed the levels of these
genes close to E/F; control mice (Figure 10A). The
extent of reduction in Gata1 expression (Figure 10A) is
less marked compared to the level of reduction observed
in the IHC data (Figure 7 and Supplementary Figure S2).
This could be because of the inherent difference that
exists when looking at Gata1 at RNA level in RT-qPCR
vs. at protein level in IHC.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The treatment did not significantly affect the levels of
EWS-FLI1 at either mRNA or protein (Figure 10B) levels,
indicating that the reduction in target gene expression
might be due to inhibition of EWS-FLI1 fusion protein’s
transcriptional activity. The mechanism through which YK4-279 inhibits the transcriptional activity of EWS-FLI1 is
yet to be elucidated. YK-4-279 does not block EWS-FLI1
binding to its cognate DNA binding sites (Supplementary
Figure S5). One possible mechanism may entail YK-4279 disrupting or interfering with proper assembly of the
multi-protein complex required for EWS-FLI1 transactivity.
RHA is one of the proteins that make up EWS-FLI1
transcriptional complex. Interaction of EWS-FLI1 with
RHA regulates its oncogenic properties [39]. Ability of
YK-4-279 to block interaction between EWS-FLI1 and
RHA [30, 31] or other components of the transcriptional
complex may explain YK-4-279’s activity against EWSFLI1 mediated transcription. We observed mitigation in the
leukemic phenotype following 2 weeks treatment with YK4-279 even though EWS-FLI1 level did not significantly
alter. Inhibition of EWS-FLI1 function with YK-4-279
may cause the leukemic cells to differentiate and lose their
leukemic property. In this case, we may have non-leukemic
cells that can still express EWS-FLI1.

DISCUSSION

YK-4-279 significantly improves overall survival
of E/F; Mx1-cre leukemic mice

Expression of EWS-FLI1 in cells with the activated
Mx1 promoter in E/F; Mx1-cre mice led to leukemia where
the mice presented with severe hepatomegaly, splenomegaly,
and anemia followed by rapid death [35]. Even though
these mice do not develop Ewing sarcoma, the malignancy
is driven by EWS-FLI1 making the model relevant to test
inhibitors that target EWS-FLI1. Thus, this pre-clinical model
was employed to evaluate the small molecule inhibitor YK4-279 against an EWS-FLI1 driven neoplasm. We show
that YK-4-279 significantly reduced clonogenic capacity
of leukemic stem cells of E/F; Mx1-cre mice in vitro. Antileukemic effects of YK-4-279 observed in an in vitro CFU
assay also translated in vivo. The treatment led to marked
reduction in the spleen and liver weights, WBC count,
nucleated erythroblasts in the peripheral blood of mice with
EWS-FLI1 induced leukemia. Moreover, the normal spleen
and liver architecture that was severely affected in terminally
diseased leukemic mice was partially restored upon YK-4279 treatment. The treatment also improved their anemic
state. Furthermore, YK-4-279 treatment extended the
survival of E/F; Mx1-cre mice with leukemia. These results
support the therapeutic potential of YK-4-279 in antagonizing
malignant phenotype of EWS-FLI1.

To determine if the observed YK-4-279 activity
(Figures 3–7) can translate into improved survival of
mice with EWS-FLI1 induced leukemia, the animals
were allowed to live with erythroleukemia following
treatment with daily 150 mg/kg YK-4-279 or vehicle IP
injections, five times a week for two weeks in a repeat
experiment. A statistically significant improvement
in survival of these leukemic mice treated with YK-4279 was measured where their median survival was
60.5 days as opposed to 21 days for the control group
(Figure 11A). During the two weeks of treatment, mice
randomized to YK-4-279 had significantly reduced
disease burden as monitored by weekly WBC counts.
The WBC count of YK-4-279 treated mice compared
to controls was lowered by 54% (p < 0.0001) and 67%
(p < 0.002) following one week and two weeks of
treatment, respectively (Figure 11B). Follow-up
monitoring beyond the two week treatment period
showed that most of the mice that received YK-4-279
retained relatively low WBC counts, while those that
received vehicle alone had rapid elevation of WBC that
led to deterioration of their health (Figure 11C and 11D).

ETS family of transcription factors share a
conserved DNA binding domain (ETS domain) all
recognizing a purine rich consensus sequence with a
central GGAA/T motif [40]. Most ETS transcription
factors also harbor a pointed domain (PNT domain) that is
important for protein-protein interactions [41]. ETS genes
have been implicated in a wide array of malignancies
including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia (CMML), myxoid liposarcoma, Ewing sarcoma,
breast cancer, and prostate cancer [42–50]. A subgroup of
AML [43, 44, 51] and ALL [42] patients harbor a fusion
protein, TLS-ERG, which is similar to EWS-FLI1. EWS
and TLS (FUS) belong to the TET family of RNA binding
proteins, while FLI1 and ERG belong to the highly
conserved ETS family of transcription factors. TLSERG [52, 53], EWS-ERG [54], and EWS-FLI1 [1] have
all been reported in Ewing sarcoma cases. Additionally,
the majority of prostate cancer cases display clear ETSdriver dependence. More than 50% of prostate cancer
patients contain chromosomal translocations that involve
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

members of the ETS transcription factor family. The two
ETS factors ERG and ETV1 reprogram the androgen
receptor cistrome with consequences for androgen ablation
therapy in prostate cancer [55, 56]. Moreover, germline
or somatic mutations in the TERT gene promoter create
novel ETS binding sites leading to 2–4 fold increase in
TERT protein expression, facilitating immortalization
and the override of senescence [57–59]. TERT promoter
mutations are frequently observed in malignant melanoma,
glioblastomas, hepatocellular and bladder carcinomas
[60]. Therefore, ETS factors have emerged as candidates
for targeted therapy in multiple types of cancers.
YK-4-279 shows therapeutic potential for ETSdriven diseases. Though we still do not know the exact
interaction surface, YK-4-279 directly binds to and shows
inhibitory activity against EWS-FLI1, ERG, and ETV1
oncoproteins, presumably due to interference with proteinprotein interactions [31, 33, 34]. Our group has shown
that YK-4-279 binds to ERG and ETV1 and inhibits their
activity in prostate cancer cell lines [33] and show antimetastatic activity in vivo [34]. Hence, potential clinical

indications of YK-4-279 or similar compounds targeting
ETS transcription factors may be significantly expanded.
It is plausible that the ability of YK-4-279 to
antagonize the activity of a number of ETS family
members could pose a risk of toxicity against tissues
that expresses ETS transcription factors as part of their
normal physiology. ETS genes are highly expressed
during embryogenesis and hematopoiesis, while their
expression is suppressed in most adult epithelial tissues
[61–65]. In this study, YK-4-279 treatment did not
suppress but rather enhanced red blood cell counts of E/F;
Mx1-cre mice compared to those leukemic mice treated
with vehicle alone. YK-4-279 caused little apoptosis
in normal liver and spleen cells and did not affect liver
function as indicated by normal serum levels of liver
enzymes. Moreover, YK-4-279 treatment did not lead
to body weight loss. Our findings combined with earlier
in vivo studies [31, 32, 34] suggest that the inhibitor has
a reasonable therapeutic window with no overt cytotoxic
issues aside from peritoneal thickening observed at the site
of intraperitoneal administration. Further analysis of YK4-279’s effect on hematopoietic progenitors cells, WBC
differential count, and hemoglobin level may help us better
evaluate the potential toxicity of the treatment regiment
to normal hematopoiesis. Moreover, detailed toxicology
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

studies in large animals would need to be carried out to
assess YK-4-279’s safety to humans.
Poor solubility of YK-4-279 limits its dosage,
frequency, and duration of murine treatment. Therefore,
the mice only received a total of 10 injections. Though
the disease was suppressed during the time period that
the mice were on YK-4-279, some showed leukemic
progression once the treatment was halted (Figure 11D).
Nevertheless, two weeks of treatment was enough to result
in prolonged survival. Future experiments could utilize a
treatment plan with a week-on-week-off schedule or a
longer treatment regimen with a lower dose to overcome
this problem. Furthermore, better drug formulation may
significantly improve the pharmacokinetic properties of
YK-4-279. Improved drug formulation may also permit
oral administration.
In conclusion, YK-4-279 antagonizes EWS-FLI1
induced leukemia in a transgenic mouse model. This
supports the continued preclinical development of the
compound for not only Ewing sarcoma patients, but also for
a subgroup of AML, ALL and prostate cancer patients with
highly homologous translocation products or with a clear
ETS-driven gene signature. Future work to further resolve
the mechanism of YK-4-279 inhibition will also enhance
fusion protein transcription factor targeted therapeutics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

transcription kit (Qiagen, Cat No. 205311) as described by
the manufacturer using Applied Biosytems Veriti Thermal
Cycler. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed in an
Eppendorf Mastercycler realplex using KiCqStart SYBR
Green qPCR ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat No. KCQS00)
per manufacturer’s protocol. Data were analyzed for
expression relative to 18S rRNA using the comparative Ct
method. Forward and reverse qPCR primers used for the
study are listed in Supplementary Table S1.

All chemicals and reagents were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise specified.

Immunoblotting
Total protein extracts were prepared from spleens
of leukemic or control mice using the following protocol.
Small fragments (~2 mm3) of flash frozen spleens were
homogenized using pestle and motor mixer (VWR, Cat.
No: 47747-370) in 200 μl phospholysis buffer (50 mM
HEPES pH 7.9, 100 mM sodium chloride, 4.0 mM sodium
pyrophosphate, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM sodium fluoride,
and 1% Triton X-100 v:v) containing 2.0 mM sodium
vanadate, 1.0 mM PMSF, 4.0 μg/ml aprotinin, and 4.0 μg/
ml leupeptin. Once the spleens were fully homogenized,
the lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min. Next, the
lysates were subjected to centrifugation for 10 min at
16,000 g at 4°C. The supernatants were collected and
the protein concentration was determined using Pierce
BCA protein assay kit per manufacturer’s protocol
(Thermoscientific, Cat# 23225). Proteins were denatured
in 5x Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDSPAGE (10% polyacrylamide). Resolved proteins were
transferred to 0.45 μm Immobilon-P PVDF membrane
(Millipore, Cat No. IPVH00010). The membranes were
blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in 1x TTBS (20 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20 v:v) for 2 hrs.
Dilutions for primary antibodies were anti-FLI1 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Cat No. sc-356) at 1:1000, antiHA (Roche, Cat No. 1867423) at 1:500, and anti-actinhorseradish peroxidase (C-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Cat No. sc-1615) at 1:5000. Primary antibodies were
added to the membranes in 5% nonfat dry milk in 1x
TTBS for 2 hrs at room temperature. The membranes were
then washed three times in 1x TTBS and incubated for 1
h with 1:5000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-linked
anti-rabbit (GE Healthcare, Cat No. LNA934V/AG) or
anti-rat secondary antibody (R&D, Cat No. HAF005)
prepared in 5% nonfat dry milk. Blots were washed three
times in 1x TTBS and then developed using Immobilon
Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate per the
manufacturer’s instructions (Millipore Corporation, Cat
No. WBKLS0100). Chemiluminescence was detected
using a Fujifilm LAS-3000 imaging system.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
TC71 cells were treated with 10 μM YK-4279 or DMSO for 2 hours. ChIP was performed using
Magna ChIP-A (Millipore, Cat No. 17-610) according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, TC71 cells were
cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature
for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with the addition
of glycine for 5 min. Nuclear fraction was obtained after
cells were lysed. The re-suspended nuclear lysate was
sonicated five times for 20 seconds with 30 seconds break
on ice. Crosslinked chromatin prepared was subjected
to ChIP using 5 μg FLI1 antibody (Santa Cruz C-19,
Cat No. sc-356), blocked FLI1 antibody (blocked with
7 times excess blocking peptide (Cat No. sc-356-P)),
or IgG- rabbit antibody (Millipore, Cat No. PP64B) in
500 μl volume, overnight at 4°C. Immunoprecipitated
DNA was eluted from column and analyzed by qPCR
for NR0B1 (5′-GATTCTGTATCAGCTGGTATATACC3′and 5′-GCATCAGGAAGCCTGGATCC-3′). qPCR was
performed in an Eppendorf Mastercycler realplex using
KiCqStart SYBR green qPCR ready mix (Sigma, Cat No.
KCQS00).

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
Direct binding study between EWS-FLI1 and
wildtype vs. mutant oligonucleotide was performed on
a Biacore T-200 instrument in the presence of 10 μM
YK-4-279 or vehicle. EWS-FLI1 was immobilized
onto a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences,
Piscataway, NJ) using standard amine coupling
chemistry in 1X HBS-P running buffer and acetate
pH4.0 buffer. The flow rate of ligand immobilization was
maintained at 10 μL/min. EWS-FL1 binding to wildtype (ATGTAGACCGGAAGTAACTA) and mutant
(ATGTAGACC GCTAGTAACTA) ETS oligonucleotides.
Binding of 100 nM Oligo-WT, 100 nM Oligo-Mutant, 10
μM YK-4-279, and 10 μM YK-4-279 + 100 nM Oligo-WT
was evaluated in a running buffer containing 1X HBS-N,
0.05% NDBS, 5% DMSO. The sample flow rate was
maintained at 50 μL/min. EWS-FLI1 binding to OligoWT in the presence of 10 μM YK-4-279 or vehicle was
evaluated using 1:1 kinetic fitting. All the experiments
were performed at 25°C.

RT-qPCR
RNA was extracted from ~50 mg flash frozen spleen
fragments using TRIzol according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Invitrogen, Cat No. 15596-018). Concentration
and purity of RNA was determined using NanoDrop 2000c
spectrophotometer (Thermoscientific). Extracted RNA
was reverse transcribed to cDNA using QuantiTect reverse

cell concentration was added in 6 ml of MethoCult GF
M3434 media (StemCell Tech., Cat# 03434). Cells were
evenly mixed in the methocult media by briefly vortexing
the tube. MethoCult media (1.1 ml) containing 1 × 105
viable splenocytes was dispensed using 16 gauge bluntend needle (Stem Cell Tech., Cat No. 28110) onto four
replicate 35 mm culture dish plates (StemCell Tech., Cat
# 27100) per manufacturer’s instructions. For CFU assays
carried out in the presence of DMSO vs. 3 μM or 10 μM
of YK-4-279, the concentrations were first prepared in
100 μl of 2% FBS containing IMDM media and were
then vortexed well with 6 ml of methocult media prior
to addition of cells. 6 × 105 cells prepared in 500 μl of
2% FBS containing IMDM media were then added to the
respective tubes. The cells were mixed with the methocult
media containing DMSO or 3 μM YK-4-279 or 10 μM of
YK-4-279. MethoCult-drug mixture (1.1 ml) containing
1 × 105 viable splenocytes was dispensed onto 35 mm
culture dish plates using 16 gauge blunt-end needle.
Number of colonies in the four replicate 35 mm dishes
were counted using 60 mm gridded scoring dish (StemCell
Tech, Cat# 27500) 4 days after plating.

For cell surface analysis of splenocytes, harvested
spleens were minced into small pieces in 1x PBS to release
the blood cells, which were subsequently strained using
70 μm cell strainer (Fisher, Cat No. 352350) to prepare
a single cell suspension. The strained mix was then
subjected to centrifugation at 350 g for 5 min. Pelleted
cells were resuspended in 1x PBS and spleen cell count
was determined using hemocytometer. 0.25 μl of CD43-PE
(Clone S11, BioLegend, Cat No. 143205), 0.5 μl of CD45Alexa Fluor-488 (Clone 30-F111, BioLegend, Cat No.
103122), 1 μl of CD71-Brilliant Violet 421 (Clone RI7217,
BioLegend, Cat No. 113813), and 2.5 μl of CD117-APC
(Clone 2B8, BioLegend, Cat No. 105812) fluorescent
conjugated primary antibodies were used to stain one
million splenocytes in 100 μl 1x PBS for 20 min on ice
in the dark. The stained cells were washed twice with 1x
PBS. The cells were then resuspended in 500 μl of 1x PBS
and analyzed using flow cytometer. For immunofluorescent
staining of whole blood, the same amount of fluorochrome
conjugated CD43, CD45, CD71, and CD117 primary
antibodies were added to 50 μl of EDTA anti-coagulated
whole blood. The primary antibodies allowed to incubate
for 20 min at room temperature. Red blood cells were
then lysed using 2 ml of warm 1x ammonium-chloridepotassium (ACK) lysis buffer (Life Tech., Cat # A10492).
The blood-ACK mix was incubated for 10 min at room
temperature. Lysed red blood cells were discarded by
removing the supernatant following centrifugation at 350 g
for 5 min. The stained cells were washed twice with 1x PBS
and resuspended to a final volume of 500 μl using 1x PBS
and analyzed by FACS.

In vivo experiments
All animal studies were approved by the Georgetown
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
E/F; Mx1-cre mice were injected with 1 mg pIpC (Sigma,
Cat No. P0913) at 1 month of age to induce Mx1 promoter.
Blood was drawn from submandibular vein using 3 mm
sterile animal lancets (MEDIpoint, Cat No. Goldenrod
3 mm) in microtainer tubes with EDTA (BD, Cat No.
365973) before pIpC injection and weekly afterwards.
Blood smears were prepared from 2 μl of weekly blood
draws onto single frosted micro slides (Corning 294875X25) and were stained using Diff-Quick staining kit
(Dade Behring, Cat No. B4132-1A) per manufacturer’s
instruction. The images were captured by light microscopy
on a Zeiss Imager Z.1 and pictures were taken using a
connected PixeLINK camera (Nikon™) at an objective
magnifications of 10x or 40x. WBC and RBC count is
used to monitor disease state and progression in addition to
enrichment for CD43+, CD71+, CD117+, and CD45− cells
in 50 μl of peripheral blood. For weekly RBC counts, 1 μl
blood was first diluted 1:200 in 1x PBS and the number
of RBC were then determined using hematocytometer.
For weekly WBC counts, 2 μl of blood were first diluted
1:50 in 2% acetic acid to lyse RBC present in the blood
and were then counted using hematocytometer. Once an
increase in white blood cell (WBC) count to an average
of 10,000 cells/μl and a 0.4–4% enrichment of CD43+,
CD71+, CD117+, and CD45− erythroblasts in the peripheral
blood were observed, the mice were randomly assigned to
treatment or control groups The animals were not enrolled

analysis.

anticoagulant to allow the blood to clot. The clot was
removed by centrifugation at 200 g for 15 min at 4°C.
The supernatant (serum) was flash frozen and stored in
−80°C until use. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in 50 μl serum
samples from healthy E/F; control mice (n = 5) and
leukemic E/F; Mx1-cre mice treated with DMSO (n = 12)
or YK-4-279 (n = 12) was measured with a Reflotron Plus
analyzer (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) per manufacturer’s
instruction.

Statistical analysis
All Statistical analyses were performed using the
GraphPad Prism version 4 (GraphPad software, La Jolla,
CA, USA). Unpaired two-tailed t-test was utilized to
assess whether the observed differences between different
groups were statistically significant if the datasets being
compared do not violet assumptions of the test. Welch’s
t-test test was utilized if the datasets being compared
have unequal variance, which violates the assumption
of a standard unpaired t test. Paired two-tailed t-test was
used to determine whether the difference in the means
between two time points of the same treatment group were
statistically different. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were
compared using logrank test.

Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin sections were de-waxed and antigen
retrieval was performed by heating in Citrate buffer
(DAKO, S2369) in an autoclave for 10 min. Endogenous
peroxidase was blocked by incubating the sections
with 3% hydrogen peroxidase for 10 min. To prevent
nonspecific stainings, several blocking steps were
performed with avidin (Sigma-Aldrich, A9275),
biotin (Sigma-Aldrich, B4501), superblock (ID labs,
IDSTM003) and mouse block (ID labs, IDSTM003). The
sections were incubated with specific antibodies against
Gata1 (Santa Cruz, sc-265) in a 1:120 dilution, cleaved
caspase 3 (Cell Signaling, 9661) in a 1:200 dilution, and
Ki67 (Cell signaling, 9449) in a 1:1000 dilution at 4°C
overnight. The next day, the sections were incubated with
a biotinylated secondary antibody (ID labs, IDSTM003)
and HRP (ID labs, IDSTM003) for 10 min. Specific
signals were amplified using 3-Amino-9-Ethylcarbazole
(ID laboratories, BP1108) under visual control followed
by a counterstaining with haematoxylin (Merck,
1.092.491.000). The sections were mounted using Aquatex
(Merck, 1.08562.0050). All antibodies were incubated
overnight at 4°C and diluted in PBS+1% BSA. The images
were taken with the Zeiss AxioImager Z1 microscope and
were analyzed using HistoQuest software (TissueGnostics
GmbH, Vienna, Austria, www.tissuegnostics.com).
For the liver samples, only the infiltrating cells were
counted and analyzed. Therefore, the settings of the cell
recognition were made in a way that all the other cell types
(e.g. hepatocytes) were not detected.
