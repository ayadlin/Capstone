BACKGROUND. The study evaluated whether the use of 3 years as compared with
6 months of androgen suppression therapy (AST) combined with external beam
radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of high-risk prostate cancer was associated with prolonged survival in advanced age men.

METHODS. A pooled analysis of 311 men enrolled in 3 prospective randomized
trials between 1987 and 2000 who received 6 months or 3 years of AST and RT
for locally advanced or high-grade localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate
comprised the study cohort. Cox regression multivariable analysis was performed
adjusting for known prognostic factors to determine whether the treatment

cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and/or all cause mortality (ACM)

cancer based on the PSA level (>10 ng/mL), Gleason score (7–10),
and/or the 2002 AJCC4 clinical T (tumor)-category (T2b to T4). Therefore, for men with localized high-grade or locally advanced prostate
cancer the combination of RT and AST has become a standard of
care, although the optimal duration of AST remains uncertain.

Based on this evidence,1–3 the use of AST in conjunction with RT has increased markedly.5 Specifically,
an increasing number of men in the US, especially
over the age of 80, are receiving AST alone or as part
of their management for newly diagnosed or recurrent
prostate cancer.6 Yet AST can also cause anemia, an
increase in body mass index, insulin resistance,
increased arterial stiffness, and less favorable lipid
profiles.7–11 These changes may explain the association between the adverse impact on health-related
quality of life (HRQOL) and the use of neoadjuvant
AST before prostate brachytherapy as compared
with prostate brachytherapy monotherapy.12 These
changes can also persist after discontinuing AST,
especially in men of advanced age.13 Some of these
symptoms satisfy the criteria for metabolic syndrome,14 a condition associated with an increased risk
of death due to a myocardial infarction (MI), despite
the absence of cardiovascular disease or diabetes.15 To
that end, a meta-analysis of randomized trials2–3
shows that 6 months of AST administration shortens
the time to a fatal MI in men of advanced age.16
In addition, a review of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and Medicare databases
shows an association with new diagnoses of diabetes
and cardiac disease and AST use.17 Concomitant with
these potential adverse findings is the knowledge that
the effective duration of androgen suppression (AS)
after the discontinuation of AST increases with advancing age18–20 and increasing durations of AST.21 Therefore, within the frame of a public health policy,
evidence is needed to individualize the administration
of AST in order to give physicians the ability to determine the minimum duration needed to maximize the
prolongation in survival while minimizing the impact
on HRQOL for an individual man planning to undergo
RT and AST for high-risk localized or locally advanced
prostate cancer.
The first attempt toward achieving this goal was
provided by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
(RTOG) 9202 study22 that randomized 1554 men with
node-negative and clinical category T2b to T4 prostate
cancer to RT with either 4 months or 28 months of
AST. In that study, no survival benefit was noted. With
regard to the question of 6 months vs 3 years of AST
the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) completed a 1117-patient
randomized Phase III clinical trial (EORTC 22961)23
comparing the use of 2.5 years of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist monotherapy to no further AST in men with locally advanced
node-negative or node-positive prostate cancer who
underwent RT and 6 months of combined AST. The
results of that trial will help to determine whether a

2005

course of AST beyond 6 months is needed in men
undergoing RT and AST for high-risk localized or
locally advanced prostate cancer to prolong survival,
but may not completely answer the question due to
the inclusion of men with node-positive disease.
While awaiting the results of that randomized study,
the current study was designed to assess whether an
association exists between length of survival after randomization and duration of AST administered from a
pooled analysis of men who received either 6 months
of AST and RT2,3 vs 3 years of AST and RT1 for nodenegative localized high-grade or node-negative locally
advanced prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Cohort, Staging, and Treatment
The study cohort comprised 311 men of median age
70 (interquartile range [IQR]: 66, 74) enrolled in 3 randomized trials conducted in Australia and New Zealand by the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group
(TROG 9601;2 N ¼ 125) between 1996 and 2000, in
Europe by the EORTC1 (N ¼ 175) between 1987 and
1995, and in the US3 (N ¼ 11) between 1995 and 2001.
These men included those who received RT and
6 months of AST or RT and 3 years of AST on the
TROG and US as compared with the EORTC studies,
respectively. These men also had either node-negative
and locally advanced (clinical T-category 3 or 4) and
any grade prostate cancer or node-negative and clinically localized (clinical T-category 1 or 2) and highgrade (Gleason score 8–10 or World Health Organization [WHO] grade 3) prostate cancer and in addition
had a serum PSA level obtained within 1 month before
randomization. All patients read and signed an
approved internal review board consent form before
study entry and had a life expectancy of at least
10 years in the US study3 or 5 years in the TROG and
EORTC studies.1,2 A summary and comparison of the
prerandomization patient characteristics and followup stratified by treatment received are listed in Table 1.
The details of the RT techniques, doses, and fields
have been previously described but the main differences included the use of an initial pelvic field in the
EORTC patients but not the TROG and US studies and
a final total dose to the tumor volume of 70 Gy in the
US and EORTC studies and 66 Gy in the TROG
study.1–3 AST consisted of a combination of an LHRH
agonist (leuprolide acetate) or goserelin and a nonsteroidal antiandrogen in the US study3 and goserelin
in the TROG2 and European1 studies coupled with the
nonsteroidal antiandrogen flutamide in the TROG
study and cyproterone acetate in the EORTC study.
Leuprolide acetate was delivered intramuscularly

each month at a dose of 7.5 mg or 22.5 mg every
3 months. Goserelin was administered subcutaneously each month at a dose of 3.6 mg in the TROG2
and EORTC1 studies or at the same monthly dose or
10.8 mg every 3 months in the US study.5 Both LHRH
agonists were permitted in the US study5 because
they have been shown to have equivalent efficacy in
the treatment of prostate cancer.2 Flutamide was
taken orally at a dose of 250 mg every 8 hours and
starting 1 to 3 days before the LHRH agonist to block
the transient increase in testosterone caused by the
LHRH agonist. Cyproterone acetate was taken orally
at a dose of 50 mg 3 times daily for 1 week before the
start of goserelin to also block the testosterone flare
reaction and continued for 1 month and then
stopped. In the US study3 RT was given during Months
3 and 4 of the 6-month course of AST, whereas in the
TROG study2 RT was initiated during the last month of
AST and conventional RT began concurrent with the
administration of goserelin and cyproterone acetate
in the EORTC study.1

Follow-up and event size
Follow-up visits were performed after the end of RT
every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for an
additional 3 years, and then annually thereafter in the
US study3 and 2 months after the end of RT, then every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for an additional 3 years, and annually thereafter in the TROG
study.2 The follow-up visits in the EORTC study1

occurred at 1 month after the end of RT and then
every 6 months for 5 years and annually thereafter.
The median follow-up (IRQ) for all patients was 5.9
years (4.2, 7.2) during which 82 (26%) deaths occurred. Given 82 events this study has 88% power
using a 2-sided P-value with a significance level at .05
to detect a doubling of the median survival or a
hazard ratio of 2.0, which was the approximate hazard
ratio observed in both the prior US3 and the EORTC1
studies.

Statistical Methods
The data fields required for study from each cooperative group were pooled into a central database held by
the study statistician and then analyzed.
Comparison of Baseline Clinical Characteristics
and Follow-up
The initial treatments were compared on their distribution of the pretreatment clinical covariates. The
chi-square test24 was used for comparisons of the categorical covariates of treatment, clinical T-category,
and biopsy Gleason score, and the Wilcoxon 2-sample
test25 was used for comparisons of the continuous
variables of age, PSA level, and follow-up.
Assessment of Associations With Survival Time
Cox regression univariable and multivariable analyses26 were performed to assess whether the treatment
received, the PSA level, age, and biopsy Gleason score

Survival After RT and Hormonal Therapy/D’Amico et al.

at randomization were significantly associated with
the survival time after randomization. For the purpose
of the Cox regression analyses the PSA level and age
were considered continuous variables, whereas clinical T-category, biopsy Gleason score, and initial treatment were analyzed as categorical variables defined
as T-category (3, 4 vs 1, 2), high-grade (Gleason score
8–10 or WHO grade 3) vs all others as the baseline
(Gleason score 7 or less or WHO grade 1 or 2) and RT
and 3 years of AST vs RT and 6 months of AST (baseline), respectively. The PSA value at randomization
was log-transformed so that these values followed a
normal distribution. For all categorical variables the
cutpoints selected were made before examining the
data and were based on established strata.27 For all
Cox regression analyses residuals26 were examined to
check for the proportional hazard (PH) assumption
and no violation of the PH assumption was found.
Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and the
associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and Pvalues for probability estimates of time to death were
calculated for all covariates using a Cox proportional
hazards model.26
Age-adjusted estimates of survival28 after randomization to RT and 3 years of AST or RT and 6 months
of AST were computed and graphically displayed.
Comparisons of these estimates across treatments
were made using the age-adjusted log-rank test.29 SAS
v. 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for all statistical analyses. All statistical tests were 2-sided and
P <.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics Stratified by Treatment
As shown in Table 1, men who were treated using RT
and 3 years of AST as compared with RT and 6 months
of AST had a significantly higher proportion of men
with clinical category T3,4 disease (91% vs 75%;
P <.001), median PSA level (32 vs 17 ng/mL; P <.001),
and median age at randomization (71 vs 69 years;
P < .001), respectively. However, there was no significant difference in the median follow-up (5.6 vs 5.9
years; P ¼ .61) or proportion of men with Gleason
score 8 to 10 cancers (34% vs 40%; P ¼ .28) among the
3-year and 6-month AST arms, respectively.
Factors Associated With Survival Time
Treatment received (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]: 1.1;
95% CI: 0.7, 1.8; P ¼ .70), clinical T-category 3,4 (AHR:
1.01; 95% CI: 0.50, 2.1; P ¼ .98), and the serum PSA
level at randomization (AHR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.9, 1.3;
P ¼ .52) were not significantly associated with survival
time after randomization, whereas age at randomization (AHR: 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.09; P ¼ .02) was. Glea-

son score 8 to 10 cancers (AHR: 1.6; 95% CI: 0.9, 2.7;
P ¼ .09) approached significance, as shown in Table 2.

Age-Adjusted Estimates of Survival
As shown in Figure 1, age-adjusted estimates of survival were not significantly different (P ¼ .80) across
treatment arms. Specifically, age-adjusted estimates of
survival 5 years after randomization were 78% (95%
CI: 71, 85) as compared with 83% (95% CI: 75, 90) for
men who received RT and 3 years of AST as compared
with RT and 6 months of AST, respectively.

DISCUSSION
Based on the results of several prospective randomized clinical trials1–3 that have documented a can-

cer-specific and/or overall survival benefit when RT
and 6 months to 3 years of AST as compared with RT
is used to treat higher-risk prostate cancer, the combination of RT and AST has become a standard of care
for men with high-risk disease. As evidence accumulates regarding the toxicity of AST,7–12,16,17 especially
in advanced age men, the question of whether more
than 6 months of AST is needed to achieve prolonged
survival remains unanswered. Therefore, the current
study was performed to glean insight into what that
randomized study is likely to show for the node-negative subset.
In the current study, information regarding baseline prognostic factors and survival times after randomization were compiled from the 3 randomized
studies1–3 that documented an overall or cancer-specific survival benefit when men with node-negative
and locally advanced or high-grade localized prostate
cancer were treated using RT and 6 months2–3 or RT
and 3 years of AST1 as compared with RT. The main
finding of the current study is that a significant association between treatments with 6 months or 3 years
of AST and survival time was not found after adjusting
for known prognostic factors. This result may reflect
the median age of 70 years of the study cohort and
the observation from prior reports that the duration of
AS after the completion of AST increases with advancing age.18–20 Specifically for men age 70 or more the
median duration of AS below the baseline testosterone levels is 18 months after the administration of
6 months of AST result in 2 years of AS.30 This result is
also consistent with the randomized RTOG 9202
study22 that also showed no difference in overall survival in 1554 men with high-risk prostate cancer randomized to RT and 4 months as compared with RT
and 2 years and 4 months of AST after a median follow-up of approximately 10 years. However, this result
is in contrast to what has been observed for breast
cancer where adjuvant hormonal therapy of 5-year
duration as compared with shorter durations lengthens survival.31
Several issues require further discussion. First,
this study provides evidence to support a lack of association between survival time after randomization
and the addition of 6 months as compared with 3
years of AST to RT after adjusting for known prognostic factors, but does not prove that these 2 treatments
will produce similar overall survival. Only large randomized studies such as those performed by the
RTOG,22 EORTC,23 and TROG32 can make definitive
statements about the impact of long- vs short-term
AST on survival because a randomized study can control for both unknown and known prognostic factors.
Second, radiotherapeutic treatment of the pelvic

lymph nodes was performed in the EORTC study,1
whereas pelvic lymph nodes were not treated in the
TROG2 and US3 studies and the dose was slightly
lower in the TROG as compared with US and
EORTC study: 66 compared with 70 Gy, respectively.
It is noteworthy, however, that despite the additional 2.5-year use of AST and the more extensive
RT that encompassed the pelvic lymph nodes in the
EORTC as compared with the TROG and US studies,
an association with prolonged survival did not
emerge. Third, a substantial reduction in death (HR
2.0) was observed in the prior EORTC1 and US3
studies of 3 years vs 0 and 6 months vs no AST,
respectively, making it likely that a further reduction
in death, if present, when increasing AST length
from 6 months to 3 years, would be smaller and
this study was not powered to measure such a
small difference.
Finally, whereas the PSA level and proportion of
men with clinical T3,4 disease were significantly
higher in men treated with 3 years as compared with
6 months of AST, these factors were not significantly
associated with length of survival. However, age was
associated with length of survival and the results in
Figure 1 showing no difference in time to death when
short- or long-course AST was delivered were ageadjusted. In addition, whereas the proportion of men
with Gleason score 8 to 10 cancers and the length of
median follow-up were not significantly different
between the 2 treatment arms, there were numerical
increases in both of these parameters of 6% and
4 months, respectively, in men who received the 6month as compared with a 3-year course of AST.
These increases could have contributed to a shorter
survival time in men receiving the 6-month as compared with a 3-year course of AST, especially given the
near-significant association of Gleason score 8 to 10
cancer and a shorter time to death in the adjusted
Cox regression analysis; however, such a difference
was not observed. Therefore, despite the use of an
additional 2.5 years of AST, treatment of the pelvic
lymph nodes, 6% less Gleason 8 to 10 cancers, a median follow-up shorter by 4 months, the age-adjusted
survival estimates were not significantly longer for
men who received long-term as compared with shortterm AST. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that survival is not likely to be significantly
different after either 6 months or 3 years of AST with
RT delivered for the treatment of men with node-negative and locally advanced or localized and high-grade
prostate cancer.
In conclusion, after adjusting for known prognostic factors, the treatment of node-negative high-risk
prostate cancer using RT and 3 years as compared

Survival After RT and Hormonal Therapy/D’Amico et al.

with RT and 6 months of AST was not associated with
prolonged survival in men of advanced age. The
EORTC randomized trial23 will help to answer whether
unknown confounding factors will affect the results of
this study.
