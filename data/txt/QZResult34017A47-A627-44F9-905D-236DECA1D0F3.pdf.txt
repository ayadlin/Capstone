BACKGROUND: The degree of response and the duration of survival of patients treated with mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) inhibitors are highly variable. Whether baseline clinicopathologic factors can predict the clinical course with treatment is
largely unknown. METHODS: For 142 consecutive immunotherapy- and MAPK inhibitor–naive patients with BRAF-mutant metastatic
melanoma who were treated during clinical trials with BRAF inhibitors (n 5 111) or a combination of dabrafenib and trametinib (n 5
31), clinicopathologic factors were correlated with the response to MAPK inhibitors and survival. RESULTS: The median follow-up was
15.7 months (range, 0.6-60.5 months). The 2-, 3-, and 4-year overall survival (OS) rates were 43%, 24%, and 24%, respectively. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that the only clinicopathologic factors associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) and OS
were female sex and a normal pretreatment serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level. The BRAF V600E genotype and an absence
of primary melanoma ulceration were also independently associated with longer PFS but not OS. The median OS was 23.5 months for
patients with normal LDH levels and 7.3 months for those with elevated LDH levels (hazard ratio, 0.31; P < .001). Complete responders
had the best survival, but disease progression still occurred in 2 of 7 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival occurs for a minority of patients receiving MAPK inhibitor treatment alone. Sex, serum LDH, BRAF genotype, and primary melanoma ulceration status
are independent factors associated with treatment outcomes. Patients with a complete response to treatment have the best survival,

INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, improvements in the systemic therapy of metastatic melanoma have altered the natural history of
this disease. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway with BRAF inhibitors, either as monotherapy or, more recently, in combination with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors, has become a
standard treatment for V600 BRAF–mutant metastatic melanoma.1-5 These drugs produce rapid initial tumor regression
and symptomatic improvement in the vast majority of patients, although the degree of response and the duration of survival are highly variable. Long-term survival may be achieved in a subgroup of patients, whereas others die soon after the
commencement of treatment. Whether clinicopathologic factors can be used to predict the clinical course of these patients
is largely unknown, and there have been few studies examining this issue.
In the era before effective systemic therapy, the survival of patients with metastatic melanoma was associated with
several factors, including the site of metastases, the level of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in serum, the Eastern

Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), and the presence of brain metastases.6-9 The relative influence that these clinicopathologic factors and those
known to be prognostic for early-stage melanoma (Breslow
thickness of primary melanoma, ulceration, mitotic rate,
and sex)6,10 may have on MAPK inhibitor drug efficacy has
not been studied formally in a multivariate model with
adequate follow-up. Furthermore, longer term survival (>3
years) with MAPK inhibitors has not been reported, and
there are limited data about the success of subsequent therapies in those progressing on MAPK inhibitors (particularly
anti–programmed cell death 1 [PD-1] therapy).
We examined a consecutive cohort of patients with
V600 BRAF–mutant metastatic melanoma who were
treated in clinical trials with BRAF inhibitors or a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors to explore which
factors were associated with drug efficacy and survival and
to assess the response to subsequent treatment after disease
progression on MAPK inhibitors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment

The study was undertaken at Melanoma Institute
Australia with the approval of the human ethics review
committee. Consecutive immunotherapy- and MAPK
inhibitor–naive patients with V600 BRAF–mutant metastatic melanoma (American Joint Committee on Cancer
[AJCC] stage IIIC unresectable melanoma or stage IV
melanoma) who were treated with a BRAF inhibitor
either as monotherapy or in combination with an MEK
inhibitor at 2 centers (Melanoma Institute Australia and
Westmead Hospital) during clinical trials between July
2009 and July 2013 were included for analysis. The clinical trials included phase 1 to 3 and phase 2 brain metastasis trials of dabrafenib,2,11-13 phase 2/3 and phase 2 brain
metastasis trials and an expanded access program for
vemurafenib,1,14-16 and phase 1 to 3 trials of combined
dabrafenib and trametinib (CombiDT).3,4,17 Demographics, primary melanoma features, disease characteristics at the time of study commencement, responses to
therapy, subsequent systemic therapy responses, and survival data were collected prospectively. The response to
therapy was investigator-determined according to Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.18
Statistical Analysis

For the entire cohort, progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) were calculated with the KaplanMeier method. For PFS, the follow-up for patients who
had not progressed was censored at the last follow-up visit
Cancer

or at the time of drug cessation for patients who had
ceased the drug before RECIST progression (eg, for toxicity). For OS, the follow-up for patients who had not died
was censored at the last follow-up.
Primary melanoma features, patient demographics,
and metastatic melanoma disease characteristics were
tested for associations with RECIST responses, PFS, and
OS. For clinicopathologic associations with OS, the
follow-up of patients who achieved a partial or complete
response (or durable stable disease for >6 months) due to
subsequent therapy after an MAPK inhibitor was censored at the time of cessation of MAPK inhibitor therapy.
The characteristics of patients were compared with
the Wilcoxon rank sum test, Pearson’s chi-square test,
Fisher’s exact test, and Spearman’s rank correlation as
appropriate. The univariate analysis was performed with
the log-rank test to identify potentially significant categorical variables for the multivariate model. Cox regression
was used to test survival for continuous variables. The
multivariate analysis was performed with the purposeful
selection of covariates method, with variables with a P
value < .20 from a univariate Cox model being entered
into the final model. The proportional hazards assumption of each covariate for both OS and PFS was evaluated
with tests and graphical diagnostics based on the scaled
Shoenfeld residuals and goodness of fit with Cox-Snell
residuals. When there was little or no evidence of the proportional hazards assumption being met for a categorical
variable, it was not included in the multivariate Cox
regression but instead was used as a stratification factor.
In addition, a sensitivity analysis was run to check
the robustness of our findings through the inclusion/
exclusion of the ulceration status, which was not available
for 35% (50 of 142), in the multivariate models. Data
management and statistical analysis were performed with
Intercooled Stata 13.1 for Windows (StataCorp, College
Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Patients and Disease Characteristics

One hundred forty-two patients were included for analysis;
89 (63%) were male, and the median age was 58 years at
treatment commencement (Table 1). No patients had prior
MAPK inhibitor therapy or immunotherapy in the metastatic setting (ipilimumab or PD-1 antibodies). Patients
commenced treatment at a median of 2.5 months after the
initial diagnosis of metastatic disease (range, 0.2-144.5
months). One hundred twelve patients (79%) had a prior
history of primary cutaneous melanoma with a median
Breslow thickness of 1.8 mm and a median mitotic rate of

5/mm2. Thirty-two primaries (28%) were ulcerated; 60
(54%) were not ulcerated; and for 20 (18%), ulceration
data were not available. The median disease-free interval
from the diagnosis of primary disease to metastatic disease
was 40.3 months.
At the start of MAPK inhibitor treatment, 119
patients (84%) had BRAF V600E melanoma, 109 (77%)
had AJCC M1c disease, 51 (36%) had elevated LDH levels, 59 (42%) had an ECOG PS  1, and 30 (21%) had
progressing (active) brain metastases. The median
RECIST sum of diameters of target lesions (SoD) was 70
mm (Table 1).
Treatment and Outcome

Seventy patients (49%) were treated with dabrafenib, 41
(29%) were treated with vemurafenib, and 31 (22%) were
3828

treated with CombiDT (Table 1). At the time of analysis,
42 patients (30%) were alive, and 18 patients (13%)
remained progression-free on treatment. One hundred
nineteen patients (84%) had ceased MAPK inhibitor therapy; 10 (7%) did so before disease progression after a median of 5.4 months (range, 0.9-29.5 months), mainly
because of toxicity (5 of these patients remained
progression-free without further treatment). One hundred fourteen patients (80%) had progressed on treatment. The median duration of follow-up was 15.7
months (range, 0.6-60.5 months).
For the whole cohort, the response rate was 70%,
and the median degree of response (% RECIST target
lesion change from the baseline) was –50% (Fig. 1). Seven
patients (5%) achieved a complete response, 92 (65%)
achieved a partial response, 34 (24%) achieved stable

disease, and 6 (4%) achieved progressive disease as the
best response (Table 2). The response was not determined
for 3 patients (2%); 2 were in the phase 1 dabrafenib trial
and did not have RECIST-defined measurable disease,
and 1 permanently discontinued vemurafenib because of
toxicity before first imaging. For the entire cohort, the
median PFS was 6.9 months (95% confidence interval,
5.4-7.4 months), and the median OS was 16.1 months
(95% confidence interval, 12.9-24.9 months; Fig. 2). The
proportion of patients alive was 60% at 1 year, 43% at 2
years, 24% at 3 years, and 24% at 4 years. Fourteen
patients were alive at 3 years’ follow-up (10 were still on
MAPK inhibitors, and 4 were off MAPK inhibitors
[2 because of toxicity]), whereas at 4 years’ follow-up, 8
patients were alive (5 were still on MAPK inhibitors, and
3 were off MAPK inhibitors [2 because of toxicity]).
Patients treated with CombiDT had a significantly
shorter disease-free interval from primary disease to metastatic disease (median, 13.4 vs 47.8 mo; P 5 .001), had a
lower proportion of M1c stage disease (61% vs 81%; P 5
.021), and were more likely to have a normal LDH level
(81% vs 59%; P 5 .03), but they had an age, disease burden (RECIST SoD), ECOG PS, and primary melanoma
features (all P > .05) similar to those of patients treated
with BRAF inhibitors. No patients treated with CombiDT had active brain metastases at the start of treatment,
whereas 27% of patients on BRAF inhibitors did (P 5
.001).
At the data cutoff, more patients were progressionfree and on treatment in the CombiDT cohort versus the
BRAF inhibitor cohort (12 [39%] vs 16 [14%]; P 5
.003), but a similar proportion of patients were alive in

each cohort (11 [35%] in the CombiDT cohort vs 32
[29%] in the BRAF inhibitor cohort; P 5 .476). The median degree of change in the RECIST SoD (% response)
was higher for patients treated with CombiDT versus
BRAF inhibitors (–64% vs –45%; P 5 .03); however, the
RECIST response rates were similar (77% vs 68%; P 5
.387). The proportional hazard tests were not significant
for either survival outcome (PFS and OS); however, the
crossing OS curves indicated a potential violation of the
proportional hazards assumption (Supporting Fig. 1 [see
online supporting information]). Therefore, a stratified
(treatment) multivariate Cox regression was run for OS,
and a multivariate Cox model, including treatment as a
covariate, was run for PFS. PFS and OS for dabrafenib
and vemurafenib patients were similar (P 5 .781 and P 5
.259, respectively).
Clinicopathologic Factors Associated With
Response and Survival

Several factors correlated with a greater degree of RECIST
response to therapy in the univariate analysis: BRAF
V600E genotype (P < .01), lower M stage (P 5 .04), normal LDH levels (P < .01), and lower RECIST SoD (P <
.001; Table 2). Age (at primary or metastatic diagnosis),
sex, primary melanoma features, ECOG PS, and the presence of active brain metastases were not associated with
the degree of the RECIST response.
In the univariate analysis, longer PFS was associated
with CombiDT treatment (P 5 .003), BRAF V600E genotype (P 5 .004), female sex (P 5 .006), normal LDH
levels (P < .001), lower RECIST SoD (P < .001), an
ECOG PS of 0 (P 5 .046), and an absence of active brain
metastases (P 5 .002; Supporting Table 1 [see online supporting information]). Interestingly, an absence of primary melanoma ulceration and a lower primary
melanoma mitotic rate correlated with longer PFS (P 5
.003 and P 5 .039, respectively). Longer OS was associated with an absence of primary melanoma ulceration (P
5 .007), normal LDH levels (P < .001), and lower
RECIST SoD (P < .001; Supporting Table 1 [see online
supporting information]).
In the multivariate analysis, factors independently
associated with longer PFS were the BRAF V600E genotype (hazard ratio [HR], 0.51; P 5 .006), female sex (HR,
0.58; P 5 .009), normal LDH levels (HR, 0.41, P <
.001), and CombiDT treatment (HR, 0.60; P 5 .048;
Table 3 and Fig. 3). In a multivariate Cox regression
stratified by drug treatment (BRAF inhibitors vs CombiDT), factors independently associated with longer OS
were female sex (HR, 0.61; P 5 .026) and normal LDH

patients with normal LDH levels was 23.5 months versus 7.3 months for those with elevated LDH levels.
Notably, other factors, including the BRAF genotype,
ECOG PS, presence of brain metastases, and RECIST
SoD, were not significant. A subgroup analysis including only patients with primary melanoma ulceration
data available (n 5 92) demonstrated that ulceration
was also independently associated with improved PFS
(HR, 0.51; P 5 .007), with a trend toward improved
OS (HR, 0.60; P 5 .056; Supporting Table 2 [see

RECIST Response Predicts Survival

The degree of the RECIST response correlated with
PFS and OS (both P < .001) as a continuous variable,
and the RECIST response category affected both PFS
and OS. PFS and OS were longer for complete responders (median PFS and OS not reached) versus partial responders (7.4 and 24.2 months, respectively) and
those with stable disease (3.8 and 7.0 months, respectively). Survival for those with progressive disease as the
best response was very poor (median PFS, 1.4 months;
OS, 3.7 months; Table 2 and Supporting Fig. 2 [see
online supporting information]).

Complete responses occurred in 7 patients (5%), all
of whom had BRAF V600E with normal LDH levels and
an ECOG PS of 0 at the baseline; none had active brain
metastases, and 3 were stage M1a. Four patients were
treated with CombiDT, and 3 were treated with BRAF
inhibitors. The median age was 62 years (range, 29-64
years), the median RECIST SoD was 25 mm (14-70
mm), 2 were women, and only 1 patient had an ulcerated
primary. So far, only 2 of the 7 patients with a complete
response have progressed on the drug at 10.9 and 13.3
months; they died at 28.3 and 14.2 months, respectively.
Two of the 5 remaining patients remained on the drug at
the time of this writing, whereas 3 had ceased treatment
because of toxicity (at 4.7, 5.7, and 12.2 months); the last
did so because of the development of a new pancreatic
cancer, of which the patient died.19 The remaining 4
patients were alive and retained a complete response after
more than 2.5 years.

After disease progression, 43 patients (38%) continued
MAPK inhibitors for presumed ongoing clinical benefit
(defined as treatment for more than 1 month beyond
RECIST-defined progressive disease)20 for a median of
3.8 months (range, 1.1-25.2 months). Fifty-eight patients
(47%) received other subsequent systemic therapies after
MAPK inhibitors: 33 (57%) received 1 subsequent line,
13 (22%) received 2 lines, 8 (14%) received 3 lines, and 4
(7%) received 4 subsequent lines of treatment. Targeted
treatments after the initial MAPK inhibitor included other
BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and encorafenib), an MEK inhibitor (trametinib), combined BRAF
and MEK inhibitors (CombiDT, encorafenib, and binimetinib), and lenvatinib (formerly E7080). Immunotherapies included ipilimumab and pembrolizumab. A
complete or partial response to subsequent treatment was
achieved in 17 patients (30%) at some time point.
Sixteen patients received CombiDT after progression on a BRAF inhibitor (Supporting Table 3 [see online
supporting information]); 5 (32%) had a partial response
(3 of these occurred after intervening second-line immunotherapy), and 7 (44%) had progressive disease.
Twenty-four patients (41%) received ipilimumab after
MAPK inhibitors; 2 (8%) achieved a partial response, and
20 (83%) had progressive disease. Seventeen patients
received pembrolizumab: 1 had a complete response, 4
had a partial response (overall response rate, 5 of 17
[29%]), and 12 (71%) had progressive disease. One
patient received adoptive tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte
therapy, and the best response was stable disease.
DISCUSSION
Several clinicopathologic factors have been shown to be
prognostic for patients with metastatic melanoma; however, very few studies have sought to determine how these
translate to patients receiving modern active melanoma
treatments, including MAPK inhibitors. In this study of a
large consecutive cohort of metastatic melanoma patients
treated with BRAF inhibitors and CombiDT, with longer
follow-up in comparison with previous reports, we demonstrate that longer term survival is possible with MAPK
inhibitors with 2-, 3-, and 4-year OS rates of 43%, 24%,
and 24%, respectively. The BRAF V600E genotype,
female sex, and normal LDH levels before treatment are
independent factors associated with longer PFS, whereas
female sex and normal LDH levels are independent factors associated with longer OS. Primary melanoma ulceration is also independently associated with PFS and has a
trend toward improved OS. A complete response to

treatment is associated with the longest survival, but relapses and death still occur. Postprogression ipilimumab has
limited efficacy; however, pembrolizumab appears to be
more effective in this setting.
The strength of this study lies in the mature followup, the inclusion of clinical trial patients with prospective
response assessments, the exclusion of patients with prior
MAPK inhibitors or immunotherapy, and the multivariate analysis. It is unique to this study that for the clinicopathologic association analyses, we censored the OS for
patients receiving effective subsequent treatment at the
time of MAPK inhibitor cessation to minimize the survival bias from non–MAPK inhibitor therapies. For the
first time, primary melanoma features were assessed.
Although PFS was significantly longer for patients treated
with CombiDT versus BRAF inhibitors in this study, OS
was not different despite phase 3 data showing improved
OS with CombiDT over BRAF inhibitor monotherapy,
albeit with shorter follow-up (approximately 21-month
maximum).3,4 The unbalanced size and characteristics of
the BRAF inhibitor and CombiDT cohorts, the greater
proportion of patients who were progression-free on treatment, and the small numbers of patients available for
assessments beyond 2 years in the CombiDT cohort at the
data cutoff no doubt influenced this result. To account
for this, drug treatment was not included in the multivariate Cox regression for OS but was instead used as a stratification factor. Only a few patients had follow-up beyond
3 years, so longer term survival results were limited by the
sample size, and a heterogeneous clinical trial population
was included (eg, patients with untreated brain metastases) with response rates superior to those seen in clinical
3832

trials. The small number of patients receiving subsequent
immunotherapy and the different lines in which they were
delivered prevented a detailed analysis of efficacy in the
post–MAPK inhibitor setting.
As yet, there are no published studies with adequate
long-term follow-up to examine the tail of the curve with
MAPK inhibitor therapy (ie, long-term responders), and
there are only 2 recent studies examining baseline clinical
factors that may predict outcomes in a multivariate
model.21,22 One study of 300 patients treated with
vemurafenib demonstrated that LDH, ECOG PS, and
age were associated with PFS and OS, and male sex was
associated with OS.21 In contrast to this study, however,
34% of the patients were not enrolled in clinical trials
and, therefore, did not have prospective response assessments; 43% had received prior systemic treatment for
metastatic disease, including immunotherapy (13%) and
MAPK inhibitors (7%); the maximum follow-up was
only 25 months; and the influence of post-vemurafenib
systemic therapies on OS was not assessed. Initial data
presented from a second study of 54 patients treated with
CombiDT with a maximum follow-up of approximately
3 years showed in a multivariate model that improved OS
was associated with males, normal LDH levels, and fewer
metastatic disease sites.22
Two studies with only univariate analyses, the larger
including more than 3000 patients treated with vemurafenib, reported that ECOG, AJCC stage, LDH, and brain
metastases were associated with PFS and OS, but followup was limited (median, 11.5 months; maximum, 21
months), and the influence of subsequent active treatments on OS was not taken into account.16 A pooled

analysis of patients from the phase 2 and 3 vemurafenib
clinical trials suggested that the only factor influencing the
duration of response (12 vs <12 months) and PFS with
vemurafenib was LDH, but only a univariate analysis was
performed.23
The serum LDH level is a major factor influencing
metastatic survival without treatment.6 This study suggests that it also appears to be the only metastatic factor
independently influencing both response and survival
with MAPK inhibitors. Notably, the median OS for those
with elevated LDH levels was a third of that of patients
with normal LDH levels. PFS and OS associations were
shown for 342 patients treated with BRAF inhibitors in a
univariate model when LDH was examined as a continuous variable as well as the aforementioned vemurafenib
analyses.16,21,23,24 The fact that the degree of the tumor
response was also inferior in those with an elevated LDH
level suggests that LDH is not simply prognostic. The
biology of metastatic tumors that produce different levels
of LDH may be distinct; for example, it has been shown
that a high serum LDH level reflects an anaerobic oxidative metabolic state.25 As such, the best treatments for
metastatic patients with normal and elevated LDH levels
may be different.
Females with early-stage melanoma have superior
survival and lower rates of distant metastases in comparison with males.10,26,27 Several factors have been proposed
to drive this (as reviewed by Sondak et al28), but the influence of sex on survival in the metastatic setting is unclear.
A single study conducted in the era before active systemic
therapies showed that females had superior survival in
comparison with males in a univariate analysis, but survival was similar in a multivariate analysis.29 In this study,
females had superior PFS and OS when they were treated
with MAPK inhibitors, but because the degree of response
was not statistically different from that of males (although
a trend was observed), this may simply represent the natural history. Interestingly, the study by Ugurel et al21 and
early data from Flaherty et al22 show improved OS for
males. A subgroup analysis of the metastatic MAPK inhibitor trials should clarify this issue.
Primary melanoma ulceration is a known negative
prognostic marker for early-stage melanoma6 and may
predict better survival with adjuvant interferon and ipilimumab.30,31 The same study that suggested a difference
in metastatic survival by sex also showed that ulceration
was a negative prognostic marker, but only in a univariate
analysis.29 In this data set, ulceration was not included in
the multivariate model because of missing data (35% of
patients); however, a subgroup analysis found ulceration
3834

to be independently associated with shorter PFS, and a
trend was observed for shorter OS. Again, the tumor
response was not statistically inferior in the ulcerated
group (although a trend was observed), and this suggests
that this finding may simply be prognostic. If such data
are available, a subgroup analysis of any of the metastatic
MAPK inhibitor trials may validate this finding. Alternatively, the adjuvant COMBI-AD (NCT01682083) and
BRIM8 (NCT01667419) clinical trials will be well placed
to examine this issue thoroughly.
Clinical trial data suggest that patients with BRAF
V600K melanoma have lower response rates with BRAF
inhibitors than those with V600E melanoma but similar
PFS and OS; however, a formal comparison has not been
performed to date.12,13,32 The results of this study suggest
that patients with V600K/R melanoma have a lower
response rate and shorter PFS than patients with V600E
melanoma but similar OS. The mechanisms behind this
are not clear, but the differences in age, chronic sun damage, and mutational load in V600E and V600K/R melanoma suggest biologically distinct subtypes that may
warrant different treatments.33,34
The selection of systemic treatment for patients with
metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma and the scheduling
of MAPK inhibitors and checkpoint immunotherapies
remain challenges to oncologists. The results of this study
suggest that durable survival is possible with MAPK
inhibitors and that this survival is perhaps similar to that
observed with ipilimumab, especially in patients with low
LDH levels. The mechanisms responsible for prolonged
responses to therapy remain unclear; however, translational data demonstrate immune infiltrates early during
treatment, which likely result in a secondary antitumor
immune response.35-37 The clinicopathologic correlates
of MAPK inhibitor outcomes described here (particularly
serum LDH) warrant validation in larger series and may
help to inform therapeutic decisions in the future.
