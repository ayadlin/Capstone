Abstract
Tumor hypoxia drives metastatic progression, drug resistance, and posttreatment relapses, but how cancer
cells adapt and evolve in response to hypoxic stress is not well understood. In this study, we address this question
with the discovery that the receptor tyrosine kinase RON translocates into the nucleus of hypoxic cancer cells. In
response to hypoxia, nuclear RON interacts with the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1a in a manner that relies on
RON tyrosine kinase activity, binding to the c-JUN promoter and activating it. Mechanistic investigations revealed
unexpectedly that nuclear RON played a more important role in activation of the c-JUN promoter than HIF-1a,
leading to increased cell proliferation, survival adaptation, in vitro migration, and tumorigenicity under hypoxic
conditions. Taken together, our results pointed to a novel function for RON as a transcriptional regulator that
promotes the survival of cancer cells subjected to hypoxia. These results suggest novel implications for the use of
small-molecule inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies targeting the RON kinase in the prevention or treatment of
advanced cancer. Cancer Res; 74(16); 4549–62. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Normal cellular responses to stress, which come from
external and internal environments, are important barriers to
carcinogenesis (1). In the progression of carcinogenesis, cancer
cells must develop a stress tolerance machinery to survive
under harsh conditions (2–4). Cells that have abrogated apoptotic or senescent pathways may show unimpeded growth
despite signals that indicate activation of cellular stress (5).
Therefore, cancer cells have acquired the capability of selfsufﬁciency for growth signals in response to rigorous stresses,
such as nutrient starvation, hypoxia, and pH change in microenvironments (6).
Hypoxia is widespread in solid tumors when cancer
cells outgrow the existing vasculature (7, 8). It is well
known that oxygen limitation is central in controlling
neovascularization, glucose metabolism, cell survival, and

tumor metastasis (9). The adaptation of cancer cells to hypoxia
also makes them resistant to cancer therapies (10). Currently, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain
hypoxia-associated cancer progression (11). Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is the crucial transcription
factor that mediates cellular responses to hypoxia (12). In
addition, epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces HIF-1a in
the absence of low oxygen tension (13), with a higher extent
of EGF receptor (EGFR) activation during hypoxia (14).
These ﬁndings support a link between growth factor signaling and HIF-1a activity.
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) are crucial in many cellregulatory processes. RTK-mediated signaling is a key mechanism by which most extracellular information is conveyed to
the nucleus in response to stress (15). Perturbations of RTK
signaling by aberrant receptor activation or genetic alteration
induce deregulated kinase activity and malignant transformation (16). Thus, RTKs and their downstream signaling effector
proteins are important targets of cancer therapy (17). Despite
this, accumulating data indicate that nuclear translocalized
RTKs directly contribute to gene regulation when they are
stimulated by their cognate ligands (18), or modulate DNA
repair in response to cisplatin and ionizing radiation treatment
(19). Thus, RTKs directly translocate into nuclei and act as
transcriptional regulators in response to microenvironmental
stress.
RON (Recepteur d'Origine Nantais), also known as MST1R
(macrophage stimulating 1 receptor), belongs to the c-Met
RTK superfamily (20). The prognostic relevance of RON overexpression has been reported in a variety of cancers, including
breast, colon, liver, pancreas, prostate, kidney, pancreas, and
urinary bladder cancer (21, 22). Hence, RON and its interaction

proteins are promising anticancer targets. We recently
reported that nuclear translocation of RON may occur in a
complex with EGFR in serum-starved cancer cells to activate
the transcriptional machinery crucial for survival (23). In
addition, pretreatment with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, abrogated the nuclear trafﬁcking, suggesting
the involvement of NDA(P)H oxidase in the nuclear translocation of RON during serum starvation. Because reactive

oxygen species (ROS) are produced by NAD(P)H oxidase
during hypoxic stress (24–26), we hypothesize that nuclear
translocation of RON may occur as an adaptive mechanism
for cancer cells in response to hypoxia.
In this study, we provide evidence that nuclear translocation
of RON occurs after hypoxia, and that it is independent of
EGFR. More interestingly, nuclear RON interacts with HIF-1a
during hypoxic stress, and the tyrosine kinase activity of RON is
required for this interaction. The RON–HIF-1a complex binds

Nuclear Translocation of RON in Hypoxia

to the c-JUN promoter, synergistically activates the expression
of the c-JUN gene, and stimulates cell proliferation, survival,
and migration in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and oxygen deprivation
The human bladder cancer cell line J82 and embryonic
kidney HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection, and authenticated by short tandem repeat
(STR) PCR proﬁling in 2014 (Genomic Center, National Cheng
Kung University, Taiwan). The human grade 2 urothelial carcinoma TSGH8301 cell line was purchased from Bioresource
Collection and Research Center and authenticated in 2014 by
STR PCR. All cell lines were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone) and antibiotic/antimycotic solution (Caisson Laboratories). Cells were cultured at
37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2. The day before
experiments, cells were seeded in 6- or 10-cm dishes overnight,
refreshed the medium next day, and then placed in a hypoxia
chamber (NexBiOxy) ﬁlled with 95% N2 and 5% CO2 to maintain
O2 at 1% for different periods. The hypoxic equipment was
plated within a 37 C humidiﬁed incubator (Forma).
Transient and stable knockdown transfection
experiments
For transient transfection, RON shRNA (pSuper-RONi) was
prepared in an RNAi system (pSuper; Oligoengine) using the
target sequence 50 -ACT ACT TGC TGT ATG TGT CCA-30 . The
HIF-1a shRNA (pSUPER-HIF-1a-Si) was provided by Dr. KouJuey Wu (National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan).
Stable knockdown strategies were designed using the
BLOCK-iT Pol II miR RNAi Expression Kit (Invitrogen). The
details of the target sequences are provided in the Supplementary Materials and Methods. The stable knockdown cell lines
were selected with blasticidin. The positive colonies were
screened using RON or EGFR Western blotting to conﬁrm the
knockdown efﬁciency.
Immunohistochemical staining, immunoﬂuorescence
staining, and confocal microscopy
Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, immunoﬂuorescent
staining, and confocal microscopy were done as previously
described (23). Antibody for human RON (C-20; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) at 1:200 dilution or HIF-1a (BD Transduction
Laboratories) at 1:400 dilution was incubated overnight at 4 C.
Then, cells were incubated with either Alexa Fluor488 (mouse)
or Alexa Fluor594 (rabbit)–conjugated secondary antibody
(Invitrogen) at room temperature for 1 hour. DAPI was used
for nuclear staining. The image analysis was performed by a
FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus) using 60/1.4 NA oil

objective lens (PLAPO). The images were adjusted using the
Photoshop CS5 software (Adobe). The intensity of nuclear RON
was measured by the ImageJ software. The primary antibody
for IHC staining on tumor tissue included anti-RON b (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), HIF-1a (Abcam), CD31 (Dako), or
nucleolin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Cellular fractionation, Western blotting, and
coimmunoprecipitation
Cellular fractionation was performed using Lamond's protocol (details at http://www.lamondlab.com/f7nucleolarprotocol.htm) with modiﬁcation (Supplementary Materials and
Methods). Primary antibodies used included RON (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), HIF-1a (Novus Biologicals), FLAG (SigmaAldrich), or HA (Covance; 1:1,000 dilution), and secondary
antibodies were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
at a 1:5,000 dilution. The membrane was exposed to a radiographic ﬁlm and developed using chemiluminescent HRP
substrate (Millipore).
Cloning of RON truncation mutants and c-JUN promoter
deletion mutants
The functional domain deletion mutants of RON constructs
were executed in two steps: ﬁrst, the A fragment was ampliﬁed
and ligated to p3xFLAG-CMV using EcoRI and BglII restriction
sites. Second, the B fragment was ampliﬁed and ligated to
p3xFLAG-CMV-A using BglII and XbaI restriction sites. For
serial deletion constructs of c-JUN promoter, 1298/þ731,
876/þ731, 243/þ731, 156/þ731, and 34/þ731 were
ampliﬁed using PCR with speciﬁc primers, and then inserted
into the pGL3 basic vector by MluI and XhoI restriction sites
(Supplementary Materials and Methods).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using a paired two-tailed Student t test
or two-way ANOVA, as appropriate.

Results
Subcellular distribution of RON in cancer cells under
hypoxic stress
We showed that NAD(P)H oxidase–derived ROS are involved
in the nuclear translocation of RON (23). Because hypoxia
upregulates the NAD(P)H oxidase, we examined whether
hypoxia triggers nuclear translocation of RON in human cancer
cells. Using TSGH8301 cancer cells harboring high level of
endogenous RON (Supplementary Fig. S1A), subcellular distribution of RON was investigated in vitro in the presence of
hypoxia (1% O2) compared with normoxia (21% O2). Confocal
microscopy showed a time-dependent nuclear translocation of

(Continued.) B and C, cells were transfected with pSUPER or pSUPER-HIF-1a-si and exposed to hypoxia for different periods. Western blotting was performed on
co-IP using anti-RON (B) or anti-HIF-1a (C) antibody. The input samples were loaded at 5% of immunoprecipitate lysate. D, confocal microscopy showed
that endogenous RON (red) was colocalized with HIF-1a (green) in the nuclei after 3 hours of hypoxia. Scale bars, 5 mm. D, bottom, percentage of cells
showing colocalized RON and HIF-1a in the nuclei was estimated for 10 different ﬁelds. E, total lysate was immunoprecipitated with RON antibody and

indicated antibodies. G, TSGH8301 cells were treated with serum starvation, hypoxia, or both for 3 hours. Total lysate was immunoprecipitated with RON antibody
and probed with HIF-1a or RON antibody. WCL, whole-cell lysate.

RON after hypoxia (Fig. 1A) compared with normoxia (Fig. 1B).
The ratio of nuclear RON ﬂuorescent intensity was higher 1
hour after hypoxia compared with normoxia, and >50% of RON
signals were accumulated in the nuclei 24 hours after hypoxia
(Fig. 1C). The biochemical fractionation experiments showed a
time-dependent nuclear translocation of RON after hypoxia
(Fig. 1D). Growth kinetics of TSGH8301 cells showed no
signiﬁcant difference within 24 hours (Fig. 1E). Confocal
microscopy also demonstrated nuclear translocation of RON
in both hepatoma (Huh7) and colon cancer (SW480) cells after
hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C), suggesting that
hypoxia initiates the translocation of cell-surface RON receptors into the nuclei of human cancer cells.
Nuclear translocation of RON during hypoxia is
independent of EGFR
Nuclear RON, in a complex with EGFR, is translocated to cell
nuclei in response to serum starvation (23). To examine
whether EGFR is important for nuclear translocation of RON,
subcellular distribution of both the RTKs was examined after
RON or EGFR had been knocked down. TSGH8301 cells were
established as negative control (Fig. 2A), and EGFR knockdown
(TSGH8301/kdEGFR; Fig. 2B) and RON knockdown
(TSGH8301/kdRON; Fig. 2C) were established as stable cells,
respectively. Quantifying the ﬂuorescent intensity showed a
time-dependent increase of nuclear HIF-1a expression after
hypoxia in negative control stable cells (90% of the total
ﬂuorescence accumulated in the nuclei 12 hours after
hypoxia; Fig. 2D), a time-dependent nuclear translocation of
RON in EGFR-knockdown stable cells (60% of the total ﬂuorescence accumulated in the nuclei 12 hours after hypoxia; Fig.
2E), and, in contrast, a time-dependent increase of nuclear
EGFR in RON-knockdown stable cells (about 50% of total EGFR
ﬂuorescence accumulated in the nuclei 12 hours after
hypoxia; Fig. 2F). Levels of RON and EGFR expression in stable
knockdown cell lines were conﬁrmed (Fig. 2G and H). These
results support that EGFR and RON can be translocated into
nuclei in response to hypoxia. Nuclear translocation of RON is
independent of EGFR when cancer cells are exposed to hypoxia, and vice versa.
Nuclear translocation of RON during hypoxia does not
require HIF-1a
To investigate the signiﬁcance of HIF-1a for nuclear trafﬁcking of RON, TSGH8301 cells were transiently transfected
with pSUPER-HIF-1a-si, and then exposed to hypoxia for
different periods. When HIF-1a was knocked down, confocal
microscopy still showed RON in the nuclei after hypoxia for 3, 6,
12, and 24 hours (Fig. 3A, arrow). This is in sharp contrast with
nontransfected cells showing nuclear accumulation of HIF-1a
that was colocalized with nuclear RON after hypoxia (Fig. 3A,
arrowheads). These ﬁndings suggest that machinery involved
in nuclear trafﬁcking of RON in response to hypoxia does not
require HIF-1a. More interestingly, a transient knockdown
experiment unexpectedly demonstrated an association of
nuclear RON with HIF-1a during hypoxia.
To conﬁrm the association of nuclear RON with HIF-1a
during hypoxia, TSGH8301 cells were transiently transfected

4554

with the control vector (pSuper) or pSuper-HIF-1a-si plasmid
and then exposed to hypoxia. Western blotting of the co-IP
using anti-RON (Fig. 3B) or anti-HIF-1a (Fig. 3C) antibody
demonstrated interaction of nuclear RON with HIF-1a after
hypoxia for 3, 6, 12, or 24 hours after HIF-1a was knocked down.
Taking together, nuclear RON is associated with HIF-1a in the
hypoxic nuclei; however, molecular targets of the nuclear
RON–HIF-1a complex require clariﬁcation.
Interaction of nuclear RON with HIF-1a in response to
hypoxia
We showed that nuclear translocation of endogenous RON
occurred 3 hours after hypoxia and is colocalized with HIF-1a
(Fig. 3D). Quantiﬁcation conﬁrmed a time-dependent increase
of nuclear RON colocalized with HIF-1a within 24 hours of
hypoxia (Fig. 3D, bottom). This observation was supported by
immunoblotting of hypoxic cells after co-IP using anti-RON
antibody on total cell lysates (Fig. 3E) and subcellular fractions
(Fig. 3F). These experiments had been reconﬁrmed by two
additional RON antibodies (Supplementary Fig. S2). Further
experiment revealed that hypoxia is more inﬂuential in driving
nuclear translocation of RON and is independent of serum
starvation (Fig. 3G).
The interaction of HIF-1a with nuclear RON is dependent
on tyrosine kinase domain
To identify the functional domains responsible for the
interaction of nuclear RON with HIF-1a, deletion mutants for
ﬁve functional domains of RON were generated (Fig. 4A and
Supplementary Fig. S3). The molecular weight of different RON
mutants was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B).
Domain mapping was performed by cotransfecting domain
deletion mutants of p3xFlag-RON and pHA-HIF-1a into
HEK293 and then incubating in hypoxia for 24 hours. The
IP/Western blot experiment showed that truncation of the
tyrosine kinase domain (RONDTyrK) abolishes the interaction
of RON with HIF-1a after hypoxia (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the
oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF-1a was
not involved in the interaction with RON (Fig. 4D).
J82 bladder cancer cells harboring low levels of RON were
chosen for the examination of subcellular distribution of
domain mutants of RON and HIF-1a (Supplementary Fig.
S1A). HIF-1a was shown to interact with RONDTM and RONFL
in a hypoxia-dependent manner, but not with RONDTyrK (Fig.
4E and F). To examine the signiﬁcance of a nuclear localization
signal (NLS) on the interaction of the tyrosine kinase domain of
RON with HIF-1a, TyrK, and TyrK-carrying NLS [TyrK(N)]
were also constructed (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4G and H, the
interaction of HIF-1a with the tyrosine kinase domain of RON
during hypoxia was noticeable in the presence of NLS.
Cooperation of nuclear RON and HIF-1a in the activation
of c-JUN promoter under hypoxia
c-JUN was shown as a stress-responsive gene targeted by
nuclear RON (23). We demonstrated a dose-dependent activation of c-JUN promoter (full-length, 1780/þ731-c-Jun-Luc)
by RON or HIF-1a (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B), with a
potential synergistic effect (Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D).

Nuclear Translocation of RON in Hypoxia

Interestingly, RONDTM seems to have a higher afﬁnity with
HIF-1a in the activation of the c-JUN promoter (Supplementary
Fig. S4D). These observations were conﬁrmed in HEK293
stable cell lines that overexpressed control vector, RONDTM,
RONDTyrK, or RONFL under hypoxia. c-JUN promoter activity
was signiﬁcantly higher in RONDTM and RONFL stable cells
than in the vector and RONDTyrK cells (Fig. 5A), supporting the
involvement of nuclear RON in the activation of the c-JUN
promoter during hypoxia.
To explore the mechanism of nuclear RON in the transcriptional activation of c-JUN, sequence of the c-JUN promoter was
analyzed using the MacVector software to identify the potential binding sites for RON (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Serial
deletion mutants of c-JUN promoter constructs were generated
(Supplementary Fig. S5B) and transfected into TSGH8301 cells
for a luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 5B). Our results showed that
luciferase activities of full-length and deletion mutants 1298,
876, and 243 were signiﬁcantly higher under hypoxia than
under normoxia (Fig. 5B). However, we found no difference in
luciferase activity when promoter deletion was further extended to 156 and 34, indicating that the promoter region from
243 to 156 contains positive regulatory elements of hypoxia. These results demonstrated that the D box of the c-JUN
promoter is the putative binding site for nuclear RON.
To identify the impact on c-JUN promoter transactivation,
knockdown of RON in TSGH8301 cells showed a 25% decrease
in 243/þ731-c-Jun-Luc promoter activity, and knockdown of
both RON and HIF-1a showed a 50% decrease (Fig. 5C). In
contrast, no signiﬁcant difference in promoter activity was
observed in the HIF-1a knockdown experiments. The conspicuous inhibition of c-JUN promoter activity in cells transfected
with RON and RON–HIF-1a double-knockdown cells implies
that both RON and HIF-1a form a complex that binds to the
c-JUN promoter.
To examine the importance of the D region's involvement in
modulating the c-JUN promoter, mutant D box was replaced
with HindIII and EcoRI cleavage nucleotide sequences in 243/
þ731-c-Jun-Luc (243/þ731-mutD-c-Jun-Luc). Promoter
activity of 243/þ731-mutD-c-Jun-Luc was inhibited compared with 876/þ731-c-Jun-Luc or 243/þ731-c-Jun-Luc
(Fig. 5D). Experiments of putative binding site mutants and
knocking down RON and/or HIF-1a support that a cis-acting
element of the D box is critical for the binding of nuclear RON
and the RON–HIF-1a complex with activation of the c-JUN
promoter during hypoxia.
ChIP was used to examine whether box D of the c-JUN
promoter is a cis-acting element for nuclear RON–HIF-1a
complex binding during hypoxia (Fig. 5E, top). We demonstrated a hypoxia-dependent complex of nuclear RON–HIF-1a

and binding to the c-JUN promoter (Fig. 5E-I). In addition,
RON knockdown abolishes the association of the RON–
HIF-1a complex with the c-JUN promoter during hypoxia
(Fig. 5E-II). To our surprise, nuclear RON bound to the c-JUN
promoter even though HIF-1a had been knocked down
(Fig. 5E-III). These data imply that nuclear RON is more
important than HIF-1a in the transactivation of the c-JUN
promoter during hypoxia. Expression of c-JUN protein was
reduced when RON or both HIF-1a and RON were knocked
down, with comparable reduction of 243/þ731-c-Jun-Luc
promoter activity (Fig. 5G and C). The potential effect of
RON-regulated HIF-1a stability was examined using cycloheximide and showed prolonged stabilization of HIF-1a
protein expression in cells overexpressing RONDTM or
RONFL (Fig. 5F). In addition, the dominant-negative mutant
RON (K1114M) abolished the interaction with HIF-1a and
downregulated the c-JUN promoter activity, supporting that
tyrosine kinase activity of RON is required for its biologic
functions in the nuclei (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Taken together, nuclear RON is the major transcriptional
regulator of the c-JUN promoter region from 243 to 156
during hypoxia. In addition, c-JUN bound by the RON–HIF-1a
complex was transcriptionally activated through the region
222/210 upstream of the c-JUN promoter from the transcription start site.
Biologic effects of nuclear RON during hypoxia
The growth rate of RON knockdown stable cells (TSGH8301/
kdRON) under hypoxia was suppressed compared with vector
control (TSGH8301/kdVector; Fig. 6A). The clonogenic assay
showed that RON knockdown signiﬁcantly inhibited the survival of hypoxic cells compared with normoxic cells (Fig. 6B
and C). These results support an essential role for RON in cell
survival under normoxia; RON expression may confer a survival advantage to cancer cells under hypoxic stress.
To elucidate the biologic effects of nuclear RON under
hypoxia, stable cell lines with RON-overexpressing mutants
were generated in J82 cells. MTT assays showed a signiﬁcantly
higher growth rates in the RONFL and RONDTM cell lines than
in the vector control and RONDTyrK cell lines (Fig. 6D). The
hypoxic adaption was also supported by a clonogenic assay
(Fig. 6E and F). Both RONDTM and RONFL cell lines had a
higher growth rate than the vector control cell line (P < 0.001).
The RONFL cell line showed a survival advantage compared
with the RONDTM cell line at 24 and 48 hours only (P < 0.01).
The Transwell assay showed a higher migration rate for both
RONFL and RONDTM stable cell lines than for vector control
and RONDTyrK stable cell lines under hypoxia (Fig. 6G and H).
The NOD/SCID mice experiments conﬁrmed that both

ChIP–PCR experiments were performed using TSGH8301 cells to examine the c-JUN promoter region involved in binding of the RON–HIF-1a complex under
normoxia (N) or hypoxia (H) for 12 hours. The "RON " represents negative control primers by RON antibody, which was designed to amplify the c-JUN
promoter region (1766 to 1604), excluding the D-box binding sites. II, TSGH8301 cells were transiently transfected with pSUPER-RONi or pSUPER as a
control, and then exposed to hypoxia for 24 hours. III, cells were transiently transfected with pSUPER-HIF-1a-si or pSUPER and exposed to hypoxia for
24 hours. The PCR products of D1 and D2 were derived from two independent ChIP experiments. F, J82 stable overexpressing cell lines were exposed
to hypoxia for 24 hours and then treated with cycloheximide (CHX; 50 mg/mL) for Western blotting. G, TSGH8301 cells were transiently transfected as indicated
and incubated in a hypoxic or normoxic environment for different periods. The results (means  SD) are derived from three independent experiments.

Nuclear Translocation of RON in Hypoxia

RONDTM and RONFL were more tumorigenic than vector
control or RONDTyrK (Fig. 7A). In addition, tumors developed
in mice injected with RONFL cells were signiﬁcantly larger
after 8 and 9 weeks (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively) than
those injected with RONDTM cells. Nuclear expression of RON
was demonstrated by IHC in xenografts stably expressing
RONDTM (Fig. 7B). Nevertheless, RONDTM stable cells were
active at inducing cell growth, survival adaptation, migration in
vitro, and tumorigenic in vivo than vector control or RONDTyrK
stable cells. These biologic effects could be ascribed to the
nuclear translocation of RON mutants, and their bonding to
the c-JUN promoter was conﬁrmed by biochemical fractionation and ChIP–PCR (Supplementary Fig. S7A and B) in J82
stable cell lines.
Implication in bladder cancer patients
Expression of RON and HIF-1a was examined in a cohort of
16 pairs of human bladder cancer and adjacent nontumor
tissue. Western blotting demonstrated overexpression of RON
and HIF-1a in 62.5% (10 of 16) and 31.25% (5 of 16) of bladder
cancer, respectively (Fig. 7C). The topographic distribution of
RON and HIF-1a was investigated by IHC. We showed that
both HIF-1a and RON were localized in the nuclei of cancer
cells (Fig. 7D and Supplementary Fig. S8). Nuclear expression of
RON was counted in relation to basement membrane (representative results shown in Fig. 7E), and a distance of 70 mm was
chosen as cutoff (11, 27). Tumor cells remote from basement
membrane have a signiﬁcantly higher incidence of nuclear
RON expression (P ¼ 0.008 by a paired t test; Fig. 7F).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report that shows the
transcriptional activation of c-JUN by nuclear translocation
of RTKs in hypoxic human cancer cells. Our ﬁnding reinforces the hypothesis that membranous RON receptor
directly translocates into the nuclei of cancer cells in
response to alterations of the extracellular environment
(Fig. 7G). We demonstrated that nuclear translocation of
RON in human cancer cells occurred 1 hour after hypoxia,
with maximum reaching at 12 hours. The hypoxia-driven
nuclear import of RON is independent of EGFR. However,
this hypoxia model is different from our earlier serum
starvation model in which ligand-independent nuclear
translocation of RON occurs 3 hours after starvation and
is associated with EGFR (23).
It is well established that hypoxic microenvironment in a
solid tumor contributes to aggressive progression and poor
prognosis (28, 29). The regulation of target genes by the nuclear
HIF-1a–HIF-1b complex in a hypoxic environment is critical
for cellular adaption to hypoxia (7). Our transient transfection
experiment demonstrated that nuclear translocation of RON
after hypoxia remained unaffected even though HIF-1a was
knocked down, suggesting a HIF-1a-independent regulatory
mechanism. This contradicts an earlier ﬁnding (30), which
reported the transcriptional activation of the RON promoter by
HIF-1a during normoxia in human breast cancer cells that
expressed high levels of endogenous HIF-1a. RON was not
upregulated under normoxia in TSGH8301 bladder cancer cells

www.aacrjournals.org

with undetectable endogenous HIF-1a. In contrast, the interaction of the RON receptor with HIF-1a, rather than transactivation by HIF-1a, in the activation of the c-JUN promoter
activity was substantiated by confocal microscopy, co-IP,
biochemical subcellular fractionation experiments, and a promoter luciferase reporter assay. Consistent with our observations, the interaction of the Notch3 receptor with HIF-1a and
von Hippel–Lindau protein in breast cancer cells was reported
to regulate the expression of carbonic anhydrase 9 (31), one of
the hypoxia-responsive genes (32). Taken together, these ﬁndings highlight a novel adaptive machinery of cancer cells in
response to hypoxic stress, in which membrane proteins
migrate directly to the nucleus and act as a transcriptional
regulator.
The importance of tyrosine kinase for the interaction of
nuclear RON with HIF-1a during hypoxia is supported by
functional domain mapping using the RONDTyrK deletion
mutant and dominant-negative mutant RON (K1114M) experiments. Considering the current scenario of nuclear translocation of EGFR (18, 19, 33–35), our ﬁnding coincides with EGFR
that tyrosine kinase activity is required for nuclear EGFRinduced cyclin D1 transcription (18). Thus, tyrosine kinase is
important not only for the interaction of nuclear RTKs with
other associated proteins, but it is also critical for transactivating their target genes.
We provide evidence that the RON–HIF-1a complex binds
to the c-JUN promoter and synergistically activates the expression of the c-JUN gene in response to hypoxia. In addition to
HIF-1a, the signiﬁcance of nuclear RON as a transcriptional
regulator during hypoxia was conﬁrmed in RONDTM- and
RONDTyrK-deletion mutant stable cell lines. This alternative
signaling activation mechanism of RON is analogous to nuclear
EGFR in the regulation of B-Myb, RNA helicase A, and STAT3
(18, 34, 36). Recently, Reilly and colleagues (37) also reported an
induction of c-JUN expression and related cell proliferation by
the nuclear translocation of ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor 1
in ATP-depleted cells.
In terms of biologic implications, stable RONDTM cells,
representative of the nuclear translocation of RON, significantly induce the cell survival, proliferation, migration in
vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo, and the proliferation and
migration of stable J82/RONDTyrK cells showed effects
comparable with those of stable J82/control vector cells
during hypoxia. We showed that RONDTyrK, although can
be translocated to the nuclei, cannot bind to the c-JUN
promoter (Supplementary Fig. S5). Given that hypoxic adaptation of cancer cells is crucial for clonal evolution (7),
mechanisms regulating the nuclear translocation of RON
deserve further investigation to improve the efﬁcacy of
conventional therapy targeting RON receptor and/or its
downstream signaling molecules.
Transcription factor AP-1 is activated by environmental
stresses, such as heat shock, UV damage, or hypoxia with
induced expression of c-JUN or fos (38, 39). Transcriptional
regulation of c-JUN and related hypoxic genes requires cooperation between c-JUN/AP-1 and HIF-1a (40, 41). Using the
TSGH8301 cell as a model, we hypothesize that the hypoxiaresponse core element is located at 243 to 156 upstream

Nuclear Translocation of RON in Hypoxia

from the transcription start site. This regulatory region is
different from conventional 200 upstream from the transcription start site under normoxia (39, 42, 43).
Further investigation revealed 25% and 50% suppressed
functional activity of the 243/þ731 c-JUN promoter
(243/þ731-c-Jun-Luc) when RON or both RON and HIF1a, respectively, were knocked down. The ChIP experiment
showed that binding of nuclear RON and HIF-1a to c-JUN
promoter is hypoxia dependent. It is interesting that transcriptional activity of the c-JUN promoter was suppressed when the
predicted RON binding site was mutated. We also showed that
the RON–HIF-1a complex cannot bind to the c-JUN promoter
during hypoxia when RON is knocked down; however, RON can
bind to the c-JUN promoter during hypoxia when HIF-1a is
knocked down, suggesting that nuclear RON may be important
for regulating c-JUN activity during hypoxia when HIF-1a is
absent. The present investigation implies that RON may act as
a "bench player" in the transcriptional regulation of c-JUN
during hypoxia. Because c-JUN promoter activity was not
suppressed when HIF-1a was transiently knocked down, we
cannot exclude the possibility that HIF-1a may associate with
other transcriptional factors in modulation of the c-JUN promoter during hypoxia.
In conclusion, we describe a novel adaptive response of
cancer cells under hypoxic stress, in which RON is translocated
into nuclei and functions as a transcriptional regulator. Nuclear RON can activate the c-JUN promoter in the absence of HIF1a. In addition, nuclear translocation of RON confers a survival
advantage to hypoxic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. A smallmolecule inhibitor of tyrosine kinase or monoclonal antibodies

targeting RON kinase could be an anticancer strategy to
repress the tumorigenesis of nuclear RON.
