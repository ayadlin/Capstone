Abstract
Inhibition of angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) can slow tumor growth, but the underlying mechanism is not fully
understood. Because Ang2 is expressed in growing blood vessels and promotes angiogenesis driven by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), we asked whether the antitumor effect of Ang2 inhibition results
from reduced sprouting angiogenesis and whether the effect is augmented by inhibition of VEGF from tumor
cells. Using Colo205 human colon carcinomas in nude mice as a model, we found that selective inhibition of
Ang2 by the peptide-Fc fusion protein L1-7(N) reduced the number of vascular sprouts by 46% and tumor
growth by 62% over 26 days. Strikingly, when the Ang2 inhibitor was combined with a function-blocking
anti-VEGF antibody, the number of sprouts was reduced by 82%, tumor vascularity was reduced by 67%, and
tumor growth slowed by 91% compared with controls. The reduction in tumor growth was accompanied by
decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. We conclude that inhibition of Ang2 slows tumor
growth by limiting the expansion of the tumor vasculature by sprouting angiogenesis, in a manner that
is complemented by concurrent inhibition of VEGF and leads to reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis
of tumor cells. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2213–23. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
that are widely used in cancer therapy reduce angiogenesis
(1), cause regression of tumor vessels, slow tumor growth
(2, 3), and may improve drug delivery (4, 5). VEGF inhibitors
have documented antitumor effects (6–8), but drug resistance eventually occurs, and other strategies for affecting
the tumor vasculature are being sought (9). Inhibitors of
angiopoietins are among the promising antiangiogenic approaches under development (10–13).
Angiopoietins are Tie2 receptor ligands that play key roles
in vascular development, angiogenesis, and remodeling. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) tends to stabilize blood vessels and promote vascular maturation (14). Ang2 is expressed in growing
blood vessels (15, 16) and promotes angiogenesis and tumor
growth (17, 18) by destabilizing blood vessels (16, 19, 20).

Vascular destabilization may involve Ang2 acting as an inhibitor or partial agonist of Tie2, which opposes the stabilizing
action of Ang1 on endothelial cells (21, 22).
Inhibition of Ang2 may promote vessel stability and reduce
angiogenesis (10). Because Ang2 promotes the proangiogenic
action of VEGF (16, 19, 20), and VEGF upregulates Ang2 expression in endothelial cells (23), inhibition of Ang2 and
VEGF together could have complementary actions by reducing sprouting angiogenesis and tumor vascularity (19, 24, 25).
Multiple approaches have been used to inhibit Ang2 to explore effects on angiogenesis and tumor growth. Among
these are genetic deletion of host-derived Ang2 (26), neutralization of angiopoietins by soluble Tie2 receptors that function as decoys (27, 28), selective Ang2-binding aptamers (29,
30), and antibodies and peptibodies (peptide-Fc fusion proteins) that selectively neutralize the action of Ang2 (13, 25).
The goals of the present study were to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the slowing of
tumor growth by Ang2 inhibitors and determine whether
these actions can add to the effects of inhibiting VEGF. First,
we sought to learn whether inhibition of Ang2 reduces the
blood supply of tumors by decreasing endothelial cell sprouting, increasing tumor vessel regression, or both. Second, we
determined whether the slowing of tumor growth results
from reduced tumor cell proliferation, increased tumor cell
death, or both. Finally, we asked whether the effects of
Ang2 inhibitors complement the effects of concurrent inhibition of VEGF on tumor vessels and tumor cells.
Toward this end, we used an Ang2-binding peptibody
called L1-7(N) to block the action of Ang2 in human Colo205
colon carcinoma cells implanted in nude mice (13, 31). The

Ang2 inhibitor was administered alone or in combination
with an anti-human VEGF antibody that neutralized the
action of tumor cell–derived VEGF. The Colo205 tumor
model was used because of its documented sensitivity to
Ang2 inhibitors (13).

Materials and Methods
Tumor model and treatment. CD1 nu/nu mice with implanted human Colo205 colon xenografts were treated with
the Ang2-selective peptibody L1-7(N) (13) and/or monoclonal anti-human VEGF antibody with a median neutralization
dose of 0.04 to 0.08 μg/mL against rat and human VEGF (clone
26503; R&D Systems). L1-7(N) has an IC50 of 71 pmol/L against
murine Ang2 and comparable inhibitory activity against human Ang2 (13) but does not bind Ang1, Ang3, Ang4 (13), or
angiopoietin-like proteins 3 and 4.3 As negative controls, tumor-bearing mice were also treated with human Fc (hFc) or
mouse IgG2. Agents were administered twice per week for
26 d. The total L1-7(N) dose of 700 μg/mouse/week administered s.c. exceeds the optimal biological dose of L1-7(N) in
the Colo205 tumor model (13). The optimal anti-VEGF antibody dose of 200 μg/mouse/week i.p. was based on pilot
experiments (data not shown). No weight loss was found
in mice receiving any of the treatments.
The treatment groups were (a) hFc and normal IgG2,
(b) L1-7(N), (c) anti-VEGF antibody, and (d) L1-7(N) and
anti-VEGF antibody together. Control protein or isotype
control antibody was added to the treatment groups to
match the total amount of protein delivered in the combination group. Tumor length, width, and height were measured
with calipers, and the volume was calculated using the formula for volume of an ellipsoid. All experimental procedures
were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines
established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of California, San Francisco and
Amgen, Inc.
PCR measurements of gene expression. Expression of
murine and human Ang2, Tie2, VEGF, and VEGFR-2/KDR
was measured by Taqman real-time PCR (RT-PCR) using
species-specific probe sets (Supplementary Table). DNasetreated total RNA (100 ng per reaction) was extracted from
Colo205 tumors and 22 other human tumor xenografts implanted s.c. in immunocompromised mice (four to five mice
per tumor type). In vitro transcribed mRNA for each gene of
interest was used as the standard for calculating absolute
copy numbers. Taqman RT-PCR was performed with the
Taqman EZ RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems).
Immunohistochemistry, staining, and microscopy. Mice
were perfused with fixative and tumors were processed and
stained as previously described (3). Viable regions of tumor
were marked by YO-PRO-1 (1:1,000; Invitrogen/Molecular
Probes), which is a fluorescent dye that stains intact nuclei

(32). Necrotic regions of tumors did not stain with YO-PRO-1.
Endothelial cells were identified by hamster anti-CD31 antibody (clone 2H8, 1:500; Thermo Scientific). Basement membrane was marked with rabbit anti–type IV collagen antibody
(1:20,000; CosmoBio). Proliferating cells were identified with
rabbit anti–phosphohistone-H3 (1:1,000; Millipore/Upstate
Biotechnology), and apoptotic cells were marked with rabbit
anti-activated caspase-3 (1:1,000; R&D Systems). Secondary
antibodies were goat anti-hamster or anti-rabbit IgG labeled
with FITC or Cy3 (1:400; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Tumors
were stained with H&E for conventional light microscopy.
Specimens were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope or a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope
as previously described (31).
Image measurements. Sections were cut roughly through
the central of each tumor and stained with YO-PRO-1 to distinguish viable regions (YO-PRO-1 positive) from necrotic regions (YO-PRO-1 negative). Multiple low-magnification (2.5×
objective) digital images, each measuring 5.1 × 3.8 mm, were
used to create a montage of composite images in Adobe
Photoshop. After adjusting the green fluorescence threshold, typically 25 to 30 (range, 0–255), the total number of
YO-PRO-1–positive pixels was determined with ImageJ software (33). The area of viable tumor was calculated as the
number of YO-PRO-1–positive pixels, each having an area
of 64 μm2.
Area density and total area of blood vessels (CD31), proliferating cells (phosphohistone-H3), and apoptotic cells (activated caspase-3) were measured in five digital images (1280 ×
960 μm in size; 10× objective lens). Four of the images were
taken in each quadrant of the tumor perimeter and one in
the center of an 80-μm-thick section. Fractional area (area
density) of CD31, phosphohistone-H3, or activated caspase-3
immunoreactivity was measured as the number of pixels
above the fluorescence threshold (typically 15–30) within
YO-PRO-1–positive regions (3, 34). The total area of CD31,
phosphohistone-H3, or activated caspase-3 immunoreactivity
was calculated as the product of the fractional area and the
total area of YO-PRO-1–positive pixels. Values for total area
of immunoreactivity were thus influenced by tumor size, but
those for area density were not.
Endothelial cell sprouts were counted in real-time fluorescence microscopic images of tumor vessels of sections 60 μm
in thickness stained for CD31 (10× objective; 2× Optovar) as
previously described (31, 35). The area density of plateletderived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β)–positive pericytes within 10 μm of tumor vessels was measured on
confocal microscopic images as previously described (31).
Statistical analysis. Values are expressed as the mean ±
SE for four to five mice per group. Tumor growth curves reflect seven mice per group. Effect of treatment on tumor
growth was calculated as the difference between the volume
increase of experimental tumors and the volume increase
of control tumors expressed as a percentage of the control
tumor volume increase. The significance of differences
was determined by ANOVA followed by the Fisher's pairwise least significant difference or Dunn-Bonferroni post
hoc test. Differences in tumor growth curves were tested

by repeated-measures ANOVA and Scheffé's post hoc test.
P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Angiopoietin and VEGF expression in Colo205 and other
tumor xenografts. Taqman RT-PCR measurements revealed
that untreated human Colo205 xenografts in nude mice
expressed abundant human and mouse Ang2 and VEGF
(Table 1). Expression of human Ang2 and human and
mouse VEGF in Colo205 tumors was near the median value
of 23 different xenograft models, and expression of mouse
Ang2 was the highest (Table 1). Human VEGF in Colo205 tumors had 5-fold the expression of mouse VEGF and 17-fold
the expression of human Ang2. Expression of human and
mouse Tie2 in all tumor types and of human VEGFR-2/

KDR in some tumor types was below the threshold of detection (<1,000 copies).
Treatment-related slowing of tumor growth. Tumors in
mice treated with hFc increased >3-fold in volume from an
average of 277 mm3 on day 1 to 871 mm3 on day 23 of treatment (Fig. 1A, i). Tumors grew more slowly in the other
groups. Compared with the hFc group, the increase in tumor
volume was reduced 62% in the L1-7(N) group, 77% in the
anti-VEGF antibody group, and 91% in the combination
group (Fig. 1A, i). Tumor growth in the combination group
was 76% less than in the L1-7(N) group and 61% less than
in the anti-VEGF antibody group. At the end of 26 days of
treatment, in comparison with the hFc controls, tumors
weighed 36% less after L1-7(N), 44% less after anti-VEGF antibody, and 59% less after the inhibitor combination (Fig. 1A, ii).
Viable regions of tumors were identified by YO-PRO-1
staining of nuclei (Fig. 1B, i), which served as a fluorescent

equivalent to conventional staining by H&E (Fig. 1B, ii). Control tumors had large viable regions, but most also had large
necrotic regions (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S1). After L1-7
(N) or anti-VEGF antibody, the tumors were smaller in overall size and had smaller viable regions (Fig. 1C and D, i); however, the amount of necrosis was about the same as in
control tumors (Fig. 1C and D, ii). Tumor cross-sectional area
was even smaller after treatment with both inhibitors due
largely to reduced viable tumor. Measurements revealed that
the total area of viable tumor at day 26, relative to hFc-treated
tumors, was 40% less after L1-7(N), 45% less after anti-VEGF

(Fig. 1D, i).
After the dual inhibitors, the amount of necrotic tumor
was slightly less in absolute amount but represented a
larger proportion of the total tumor mass (Fig. 1D, i and
ii). Necrosis tended to be greater near the center and less
at the periphery in all groups of tumors (Supplementary

anti-VEGF antibody and the inhibitor combination but
was also found in the other treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Suppression of Tumor Growth by Ang2 and VEGF Inhibition

Cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed in viable regions of tumors stained for phosphohistone-H3 and activated
caspase-3, respectively. Tumor cells were the predominant
cell type in Colo205 tumors and were the predominant cell
stained by markers of proliferation and apoptosis. At day 26,
phosphohistone-H3–immunoreactive cells were abundant in
tumors treated with hFc (Fig. 2A, i) but were less numerous
after L1-7(N) (Fig. 2A, ii), anti-VEGF antibody (Fig. 2A, iii), or
the inhibitor combination (Fig. 2A, iv). The area density of
phosphohistone-H3 staining was significantly less after treatment with any of the active agents than after hFc, with reductions of 68% after L1-7(N), 63% after anti-VEGF
antibody, and 67% after the inhibitor combination (Fig. 2B).
Similarly, the total area of phosphohistone-H3 staining was
83% less after L1-7(N), 81% less after anti-VEGF antibody,
and 82% less after the inhibitor combination (Fig. 2C).
Apoptotic cells identified by activated caspase-3 immunoreactivity were located throughout the viable regions of tumors in all groups treated for 26 days (Fig. 3A). Apoptotic
cells tended to be more abundant after L1-7(N) (Fig. 3A, ii),

anti-VEGF antibody (Fig. 3A, iii), or the inhibitor combination (Fig. 3A, iv). The amount of activated caspase-3 staining,
expressed as a percentage of tumor area in comparison with
the hFc control, doubled after L1-7(N) (Fig. 3B). The increase
in apoptosis was not significant after the anti-VEGF antibody
(48%) but was significant after the inhibitor combination
(63%; Fig. 3B). The total area of staining expressed in absolute units (mm2) was not significantly different among the
four treatment groups (Fig. 3C), where increases in percentage of tumor stained were offset by decreases in tumor size.
Changes in tumor vascularity after treatment. Tumor
blood vessels were examined to determine whether the decrease in proliferation and increase in apoptosis were attributable to vascular pruning. CD31-positive blood vessels in
control tumors were abundant and tortuous, were uneven
in size, and had numerous sprouts (Fig. 4A, i). Tumor vascular density was unchanged after treatment with L1-7(N) (Fig.
4A, ii), tended to be less after anti-VEGF antibody (Fig. 4A,
iii), but was conspicuously reduced after treatment with
the inhibitor combination (Fig. 4A, iv).

(values expressed in square millimeters of tumor) to take
into account treatment-related differences in overall tumor
size, the values were 37% less after L1-7(N), 51% less after

Suppression of Tumor Growth by Ang2 and VEGF Inhibition

Discussion
This study sought to determine the effects on tumor cells
and tumor blood vessels of the Ang2 inhibitor L1-7(N) and
whether the changes complement the effects of inhibiting
VEGF from tumor cells. Both the Ang2 and VEGF inhibitor
decreased vessel sprouting and slowed tumor growth, but
these changes were significantly greater when the two agents
were combined than when either was given alone. The reduction in tumor growth was associated with decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Together, the results
indicate that inhibition of Ang2 and VEGF together has
additive effects on tumor growth and angiogenesis.
Effect of Ang2 and VEGF inhibition on tumor growth.
Inhibition of Ang2 or VEGF slowed tumor growth, and inhibition of both together slowed tumor growth even more. The
amount of necrosis did not change much with treatment, but
slowing of tumor growth was accompanied by reduction in
the amount of viable tumor, reduced cell proliferation, and
increased apoptosis. Tumor cell apoptosis also increases after dual inhibition of Ang1 and Ang2 (13). Increased tumor
cell apoptosis without a measurable increase in amount of
necrosis may reflect more efficient clearance of cell debris,
but further studies are needed to understand the fate of tumor cells that die.
After inhibition of Ang2, the fractional area of proliferating cells decreased and the fractional area of tumor cell apoptosis increased, but the total area occupied by apoptotic
cells did not change significantly because the higher frequency of apoptotic events was offset by the reduction in
tumor size.
Because YO-PRO-1 stains all nuclei, the values for tumor
area reflect all cellular constituents. The identity of proliferating and apoptotic cells was not determined, but the predominance of tumor cells in Colo205 tumors makes it
reasonable to assume that most phosphohistone-H3–positive
or activated caspase-3–positive cells were tumor cells. Taken
together, our findings suggest that most of the reduction in
tumor growth resulted from a combination of decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased tumor cell apoptosis.
Inhibition of Ang2 and VEGF together had additive effects
on decreasing tumor volume but not on proliferation, apoptosis, or necrosis. However, readouts for cell proliferation
and death were only a snapshot of their effect at the end
of the experiment. Changes in rate of cell proliferation or
death occurring earlier in the 26-day experiment, well in advance of when the measurements were made, could have had
disproportionate effects in slowing tumor growth.
Necrosis was present in tumors of all treatment groups
and tended to be greatest centrally. Central necrosis, which
was especially prominent after anti-VEGF antibody and the
inhibitor combination, is a common feature of implanted xenografts that is usually attributed to higher interstitial pressure and poorer blood flow at the center of tumors (36, 37).
Less necrosis at the perimeter may also reflect well-perfused
vasculature of the surrounding normal tissue, although other
properties that favor resistance of this region to inhibitors
cannot be excluded.

Reduction of tumor vascularity and endothelial sprouting.
The present findings are consistent with the familiar view
that tumor growth is restricted by expansion of its blood supply and that reduced blood vessel growth will slow tumor
growth proportionately. We found that the tumor vascularity
was reduced after inhibition of Ang2 and VEGF together but
was not significantly different among the other treatment
groups. However, the total area of tumor blood vessels, scaled
for tumor size, was reduced after Ang2 inhibition alone or
after VEGF inhibition alone and was reduced even more
when treatments were combined. These findings suggest that
tumors grew synchronously with their blood vessels and
maintained a constant ratio of blood vessels to tumor area,
unless perturbed by inhibitors of both Ang2 and VEGF.
Angiogenesis inhibitors can reduce the number of tumor
vessels by inhibition of endothelial sprouting and new vessel
growth (35, 38) or by causing regression of existing vessels (3,
39). In this study, we sought to determine whether inhibition
of Ang2 and VEGF together had additive effects on the reduction of tumor vascularity and growth. The present findings
are consistent with previous results (31), showing that inhibition of Ang2 was followed by reduced endothelial sprouting
without much regression of tumor vessels. Ang2 inhibition
also increased the pericyte coverage of tumor vessels (31).
These actions are consistent with the concept that Ang2 acts
as a partial antagonist of Tie2 signaling, whereby Ang2 promotes vessel destabilization, unlike Ang1, which promotes
vessel stabilization (14, 15). Together, these results indicate
that Ang2 inhibition suppressed the growth of tumor vessels
by blocking the destabilizing action of Ang2 on tumor vessels
and unmasking the stabilizing action of Ang1.
In contrast, VEGF inhibition led to regression of tumor
blood vessels and reduced endothelial sprouting, as found
in previous studies (3, 40). Inhibition of VEGF and Ang2 together reduced the number of endothelial sprouts to an extent greater than either inhibitor alone. However, the
appearance of empty basement membrane sleeves was evident only after the anti-VEGF antibody or the inhibitor combination. Thus, the greater reduction in tumor vessels after
inhibition of VEGF and Ang2 together is likely to result from
additive effects on endothelial sprout suppression and tumor
vessel regression.
Benefits of targeting multiple antiangiogenic pathways.
Recent studies suggest that targeting VEGF alone, although
effective in eliminating some tumor blood vessels, only temporarily halts tumor growth and may even promote tumor
aggressiveness and metastasis (40, 41). Anti-VEGF therapy
is most effective when combined with chemotherapy or radiation (42). Another potentially beneficial strategy is to target
multiple receptor tyrosine kinases in the hope of killing more
tumor blood vessels than with anti-VEGF treatment alone.
Multikinase inhibitors that target VEGF, PDGF, and other receptors were developed for this purpose and can eliminate
more tumor blood vessels than anti-VEGF treatment alone
(43–45). Inhibition of VEGF and PDGF together is more
efficacious against all stages of pancreatic islet tumors in
RIP-Tag2 mice than either inhibitor alone (46). The present
findings indicate that a reasonable multitargeted approach

would be to combine inhibitors of Ang2 with inhibitors of
VEGF signaling.
The downstream effects of angiogenesis inhibitors on tumor cells via blood vessels are incompletely understood, but
these inhibitors can have complex effects on tumor growth
(4, 34). Angiogenesis inhibitors are thought to slow tumor
growth by eliminating blood vessels. VEGF inhibition reduces
growth of some human cancers by stopping angiogenesis,
destroying existing tumor vessels, and reducing blood flow
(47, 48). Inhibition of PDGF-B can increase tumor growth
in a preclinical model despite the regression of 80% of the
blood vessels (34). Some angiogenesis inhibitors that clearly
reduce tumor vascularity can paradoxically accelerate tumor
invasiveness and growth (40, 41). Both the quantity and the
quality of tumor vessels determine whether tumors grow or
regress. The results of the present study revealed that tumor
vascularity and tumor growth are tightly coupled in Colo205
tumors. Inhibition of Ang2 or VEGF alone led to decreased
tumor vascularity and reduced tumor size, and the combination had complementary effects.
Other potential mechanisms for antitumor effects of
Ang2 inhibition. By using species-specific probe sets, expression in tumors of human Ang2, Tie2, VEGF, and VEGFR-2/
KDR in human Colo205 tumor cells could be measured separately from the corresponding mouse proteins in stromal cells.
Measurements by Taqman RT-PCR revealed that expression
of human tumor cell–derived VEGF was higher than mouse
VEGF, but expression of mouse stromal cell–derived Ang2
and VEGFR-2 was higher than human. As there are far greater
numbers of tumor cells than endothelial cells, these species
differences in Ang2 and VEGFR-2 expression would be magnified if determined on a per-cell basis. These observations fit
with published evidence for Ang2 expression in blood vessels
of Colo205 tumors (13) and similar unpublished data for
VEGFR-2 in these tumors. Tie2 expression was not detectable
by quantitative RT-PCR or in situ hybridization, consistent
with low expression or sparse distribution of Tie2 expression
in endothelial cells, monocytes, or macrophages in Colo205
tumors. Together, these results are consistent with direct
effects of Ang2 and VEGF inhibitors mainly on blood vessels
in tumors. The reduction in tumor cell proliferation and increase in apoptosis are likely secondary to the vascular changes.
Inhibition of Ang2 may have additional beneficial effects in
cancer therapy, which are mediated by mechanisms that are

separate from the destabilizing effect of Ang2 on tumor vessels. Recent studies have reported that tumor-associated
monocytes or macrophages express Tie2 receptors, can be
recruited and/or activated by angiopoietins, and promote tumor angiogenesis by release of proteases that liberate sequestered VEGF from tumor matrix (49, 50). Further
studies will be needed to determine whether inhibition of
Ang2 signaling suppresses a macrophage-dependent mechanism that complements the direct effects of Ang2 inhibition
on endothelial cells.
Possible mechanisms that explain the effects of inhibitors
of Ang2 or VEGF, given alone or in combination, on tumor
growth and angiogenesis are illustrated in Fig. 5D. Ang2 inhibition prevents the growth of new vessels by endothelial
sprout formation. Reduced sprouting leads to less tumor cell
proliferation, more tumor cell apoptosis, and smaller tumors.
VEGF inhibition is followed by tumor vessel regression, the
formation of empty basement membrane sleeves, and reduced tumor growth. Blockade of Ang2 and VEGF together
has additive effects on sprouting and vessel regression and
produces greater slowing of tumor growth. Together, our
findings suggest that Ang2 inhibitors and VEGF inhibitors
have complementary antiangiogenic actions and effects on
reducing tumor growth.
