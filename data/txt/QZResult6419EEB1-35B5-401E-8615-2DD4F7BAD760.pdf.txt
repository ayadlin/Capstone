Agents: A Simplified Approach for
Venous Access

BACKGROUND: Isolated limb infusion (ILI) of cytotoxic agents is a regional therapy for cutaneous malignancies in a
single extremity. Conventional ILI technique requires retrograde catheterization of the contralateral femoral vein. A
novel modified ILI technique uses an ipsilateral popliteal venous approach. The purpose of this study was to compare
the performance of ILI using the 2 different approaches. METHODS: Data from patients who underwent lower-extremity ILI at the authors’ institution between October 2005 and June 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. The
authors compared the 2 ILI approaches with regard to overall procedure time, fluoroscopy time, and the number of
callbacks to the operating room (OR) for flow-related issues. The Student t test and Fisher exact test were used.
Adverse events, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the treated limb, were recorded. RESULTS: Between October 2005 and June 2008, 67 lower-extremity ILI procedures (15 using a contralateral venous access approach and
52 using an ipsilateral venous access approach) were performed in 62 patients (28 men and 34 women aged 31-82
years). The mean fluoroscopy times for the contralateral and ipsilateral groups were 17.9 and 8.3 minutes, respectively
(P ¼ .0019). No significant difference in the overall procedure time and number of callbacks to the OR for flow-related
issues between the 2 groups was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The ipsilateral popliteal venous approach is a simplified
and safe ILI technique with significantly lower overall fluoroscopy procedure times required for catheter placement and
no difference in catheter-related adverse events, when compared with the conventional contralateral approach. Cancer

Isolated limb infusion (ILI) is a relatively new technique used to treat disease primarily located in a single extremity.
ILI is predominantly used to treat advanced melanoma with in-transit metastases but can also be used to treat Merkle cell
tumors, diffuse B-cell lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and soft-tissue sarcomas,1-3 and, occasionally, even nononcologic conditions such as refractory verrucae vulgaris.4 ILI evolved from the procedure known as isolated limb perfusion (ILP), a procedure that involved isolation of the limb’s blood supply and perfusion with oxygenated blood and
therapeutic agents.5 ILI is essentially the same as ILP but does not require extracorporeal oxygenation, thus reducing the
amount of operating room (OR) time needed and resources used.6,7 Traditionally, arterial and venous access catheters are
introduced from the contralateral limb under image guidance with catheter tips carefully positioned distal to the level of
tourniquet pressure. Chemotherapy is infused for approximately 30-45 minutes, followed by a washout of the limb. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that there is adequate distribution of the chemotherapy in vivo,8 and pharmacodynamic
studies have shown that relative to ILP, the hypoxia and acidosis induced by ILI increases the activity of melphalan by a
factor of 1.5 to 3.0.9,10 Although some have questioned whether ILI is more effective than ILP,11 ILI has similar overall
response rates as ILP does, with reduced morbidity, especially among older patients.12-15

No modifications in the catheter insertion technique
have been reported since ILI was initially described. By
using the conventional approach, difficulty advancing the
tip of the venous catheter can be encountered as the intervention requires retrograde traversal of the venous valves.
Occasionally, when using the retrograde approach, it can
be difficult to identify the femoral vein with a most suitable diameter. These issues can be mitigated by the use of
the popliteal vein of the extremity to be treated, as the
catheter is inserted under image guidance and easily
advanced in an antegrade fashion, along the natural direction of flow, into the dominant femoral vein. However, it
remains unknown whether ILI using a popliteal vein
approach is technically superior to the conventional ILI
approach. The aim of the current study was to review our
experience in using the modified ILI technique to reduce
the time and difficulty in placing the venous access catheter and to report its safety with regard to venous thrombosis compared with conventional ILI.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We reviewed all ILIs performed at The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between October
2005 and June 2008. The institutional electronic medical
records database included clinical information, as well as
technical parameters related to the procedure performed,
such as arterial and venous access sites, catheter size, fluoroscopy time, overall procedure time, and procedural
complications. Supplemental information was obtained
from handwritten patient-case logs and the Social Security
Death Index.16 The institutional review board waived
requirements for informed consent for this retrospective
study.
Patients were excluded when the ILI was performed
for an upper extremity or when follow-up data were not
found in the database. Patients’ diseases were staged
according to M. D. Anderson classification criteria.17
Before ILI, the patient’s surgeon placed a radiopaque marker along the lower margin of the limb tourniquet, to guide subsequent catheter positioning on the
extremity to be treated. Fellowship-trained interventional
radiologists performed all catheter placements. Conventional ILI was performed as described previously with
insertion of both the arterial and venous catheters from
the contralateral femoral approach.6 For the simplified ipsilateral approach, the patient was initially placed in a
prone position. Preprocedural ultrasonography was used
to identify the popliteal vein in the extremity to be treated.

After sterile preparation and local anesthesia, a 21-gauge
needle and a 0.018-inch guidewire were passed into the
vein under direct sonographic guidance. The needle was
exchanged for a 5 French micropuncture set (Micropuncture Introducer Set; Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind)
transition dilator to accommodate a 0.035-inch guidewire. The guidewire was advanced into the femoral vein
and exchanged for a 5 French multisidehole polyurethane
catheter (One Step Centesis Catheter, Merit Medical,
South Jordan, Utah) (Fig. 1). The venous catheter was
then securely taped to the skin and connected to an infusion pump. Patients were then placed in a supine position,
and the contralateral groin was prepared and anesthetized.
The common femoral artery was accessed, and a 5 French
catheter was inserted into the artery and advanced across

the aortic bifurcation using traditional Seldinger technique. Subsequently, a guidewire was advanced into the
contralateral superficial femoral artery. After catheter
exchange over this wire, a 5 French multisidehole nylon
straight flush catheter (Royal Flush, Cook Medical) was
inserted and advanced until the tip and all sideholes were
situated below the mark for the planned tourniquet. Once
the catheter was considered to be in an acceptable final
position, it was secured to the skin and connected to an
infusion pump. Anticoagulation therapy was not used
during the procedures. Patients were then transported
directly to the surgical suite for the remainder of the limb
infusion procedure.
After ILI, patients were monitored in the hospital
for 3 to 21 days (mean, 8 days). Of the 67 cases, 37 had
follow-up ultrasonography of the treated extremity to
evaluate for potential DVT. Ultrasonography was performed 2 to 19 days postoperatively (mean, 4.4 days). In
addition, the number of callbacks to the OR was recorded
to assess the adequacy of catheter flow during therapy.
Overall procedure time and catheter-related adverse
events were also recorded. Particular attention to the
potential for DVT of the treated limb was made as a
means to determine the safety of the ipsilateral approach.
The 2 groups were statistically compared using a 2tailed, 2-sample pooled Student t test to compare age and fluoroscopy times. A 2-sided Fisher exact test was used to com-

pare sex, callback rates, DVT rates, and arterial and venous
problems. P values less than .05 were considered significant.

RESULTS
ILI was performed 78 times at M. D. Anderson between
October 2005 and June 2008 with 67 procedures (62
patients) meeting the inclusion criteria. Ten patients who
underwent ILI for an upper extremity and 1 patient with
inadequate follow-up were excluded from the study. The
67 remaining cases were performed in 62 patients (24
men and 38 women). Two patients in the contralateral
group had subsequent procedures performed with the ipsilateral approach. Three patients in the ipsilateral group
also had a second ILI procedure performed with an ipsilateral approach. For the purposes of this study, each ILI was
treated as an independent event (Fig. 2).
Most patients had disease primarily localized to 1 extremity, although a few had distant metastases (n ¼ 7). The
majority of patients had a diagnosis of advanced melanoma
stage IIIa or greater (n ¼ 64) (grading determined according
to the revised TNM staging system). Other malignancies
included diffuse B-cell lymphoma (n ¼ 1), metastatic adenocarcinoma (n ¼ 1), and Merkle cell carcinoma (n ¼ 1).
Overall, the patients in this study ranged in age from
31 to 84 years (mean, 62 years) (Table 1). The 6 men and
9 women who underwent the contralateral approach
ranged in age from 39 to 79 years (mean, 58.1 years). Of

the 52 cases performed with the ipsilateral approach, the
patients ranged in age from 31 to 84 years (mean, 63.2
years). There was no significant difference in the 2 groups
on the basis of age (P ¼ .13) or sex (P ¼ .77).
ILI catheter insertion was successful in all 67 procedures. Fluoroscopy times were available for 11 of the 15
contralateral-approach procedures and for 50 of the 52 ipsilateral-approach procedures. We found a significant difference in the mean fluoroscopy times between the
contralateral-approach procedures (17.9 minutes; range,
8.0 to 47.4 minutes) and the ipsilateral-approach procedures (8.3 minutes; range, 2.7 to 49.3 minutes) (P ¼
.0019). Overall procedure times were available for 14 of
the 15 contralateral-approach procedures and for 44 of
the 52 ipsilateral-approach procedures. The difference in
the mean total procedure times for the contralateral
approach (80 minutes; range, 33 to 163 minutes) and the
ipsilateral approach (86 minutes; range, 49 to 187
minutes) was not statistically significant.
Callbacks to the OR for the contralateral approach
occurred in 2 of the 15 (13.3%) standard ILI procedures
because of venous flow technical issues. In both cases, the
poor flow was due to close proximity between the catheter
tips and the pneumatic tourniquet. Callbacks to the OR
for the ipsilateral approach occurred in 4 of the 52 (7.7%)
ILI procedures because of venous (n ¼ 1; 1.9%) and arterial (n ¼ 3; 5.8%) technical issues. The case of poor venous flow was due to close proximity between the catheter
tip and the pneumatic tourniquet. The cases of poor arterial flow were due to kinking of the catheter at the aortic

bifurcation (n ¼ 1), malposition of the catheter tip (n ¼
1), and presence of small fibrin clot at the catheter tip
(n ¼ 1). There was no significant overall difference in the
callback rate between the 2 approaches (P ¼ .61) or in the
rate of arterial (P ¼ .46) or venous problems (P ¼ .12).
Seven of the 15 contralateral cases and 30 of the 52
ipsilateral cases had follow-up ultrasonography to rule out
deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within 30 days of the procedure (Table 2). None of the patients in the ipsilateral
group had DVTs, whereas 1 patient in the contralateral
group had image findings suspicious for DVT on the basis
of the presence of nonphasic flow in the popliteal vein.
There was no significant difference in the DVT rate
between the 2 venous approaches (P ¼ .23). The 1 suspected DVT was due to a chronic, nonocclusive, deep-vein
thrombus within the common femoral vein and nonphasic
flow in the popliteal vein. The patient had no known prior
history of DVT and no clinical evidence of thrombus propagation or pulmonary embolism. The patient was placed
on therapeutic low–molecular-weight heparin (Lovenox)
and was able to walk without difficulty before discharge.
Subsequent follow-up visits did not reveal further sequelae
of the DVT or any new thrombotic complications.
Patients were also followed up between 5 and 60
days postoperatively. None had clinical evidence of DVT
after discharge. Eight patients were readmitted for complications unrelated to DVT or other catheter-related
issues within 60 days of the operation.

DISCUSSION
The significantly lower fluoroscopy time needed for the
combined arterial and venous catheter placement during

procedures using the ipsilateral technique, resulted in a
reduction in total radiation dose to the operator and the
patient. Overall procedure times were not significantly
different. This is likely due to the finding that any
amount of time saved during fluoroscopy was offset by
the time needed for ultrasound of the popliteal fossa as
well as repositioning the patient from prone to supine to
gain contralateral femoral access for the arterial catheter.
In addition, only 1 of 52 (1.9%) patients in the ipsilateral
group was called back to the OR for venous issues,
whereas 2 of 15 (13.3%) patients in the contralateral
group were called back. Although the callback rate was
not significantly lower, it was not significantly different
from the conventional ILI technique. Flow rates for catheters placed by the ipsilateral approach appeared to be
subjectively higher than the rates achieved with the contralateral approach. Some of this can be attributed to the
shorter (length) catheter used in the ipsilateral approach
with its thinner wall and slightly larger lumen, compared
with the 6 French catheter (Gensini, Cook Medical) used
in the conventional contralateral approach. In addition, a
catheter placed in the ipsilateral popliteal vein is positioned along the normal circulation and not against
direction of the valves, thus optimizing blood flow.
One risk of using the ipsilateral venous access
approach is the potential for postoperative DVT related to
the indwelling catheter or the trauma of the popliteal vein
at the access site. Venous thromboembolism cannot only
lead to pulmonary emboli but can also cause significant
chronic venous disease, increasing the morbidity of patients
already in poor condition.18,19 Although our sample sizes
were relatively small, we did not find a significant difference
between the contralateral and ipsilateral venous approach
with regard to DVT. There were no cases of DVT in the
treatment limb in the ipsilateral group, and, thus, this
approach from a catheter-related complication standpoint
is as safe as the contralateral approach. Moreover, placing a
venous catheter in a retrograde fashion in the popliteal vein
should have a lesser risk of damage to the native valves, thus
decreasing the likelihood of a DVT.
This was a retrospective study in which we used
unbalanced sample sizes to analyze the experience of one
major cancer center. Despite these limitations, our study
establishes that ILI using the ipsilateral popliteal venous
access substantially decreases radiation exposure to the
patient and medical staff because of the significantly lower
fluoroscopy time required for catheter insertion. Given
the poor prognosis of advanced melanoma, the development of proper technique facilitates delivery of novel

therapies.20,21 By using an ipsilateral, popliteal, venous
access approach in ILI is safe without an increase in catheter-related adverse events.
