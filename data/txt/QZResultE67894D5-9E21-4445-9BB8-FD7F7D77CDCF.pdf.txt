ABSTRACT
Aberrant activity of tyrosine kinases has been proved to be associated with
multiple diseases including fibrotic diseases. Tyrosine kinases inhibitors (TKIs) might
be a novel approach to transform the anti-fibrotic treatment. However, both beneficial
and adverse effects are observed by researchers when using these TKIs in either
preclinical animal models or patients with hepatic fibrosis. Since hepatotoxicity of
TKIs is the leading cause for drug withdrawals thus limits its application in antifibrosis, not only efficacy but also safety of TKIs should be paid great concerns. It has
been observed in a few studies that TKIs could induce relatively high rate of hepatic
biochemical markers elevations and even result in liver failure. Fortunately, several
strategies have been adopt to handle with the hepatotoxicity. Accumulating evidences
suggest that hepatic stellate cells (HSC) play a pivotal role in hepatic fibrogenesis, so
it might be a good option to develop selective TKIs specifically targeting HSCs. The
present review will briefly summarize the anti-fibrotic mechanism of TKIs, adverse
effects of TKIs as well as the novel developed selective delivery of TKIs.

INTRODUCTION

as well as hepatic cirrhosis. However, TKI applications
in management of hepatic fibrosis are limited by their
hepatotoxicity which has been reported by many
clinicians. How to balance the beneficial anti-fibrotic
effects and hepatotoxicity of TKIs is a key question and
needed to be fully discussed. Although these mentioned
controversies have yet remained unanswered, the best
advice is to thoroughly understand the mechanisms of
anti-fibrosis and hepatotoxicity of TKIs. Hopefully,
more details are becoming clear day by day, which have
made researchers renew their understandings of TKIs in
management of hepatic fibrosis. This review will mainly
summarize recent findings and unresolved problems of
TKIs in anti-hepatic fibrosis.

Tyrosine kinases (TKs) is a family of tyrosine
protein kinases with important functions in regulation of
a variety of physiological cell processes. Abnormal TKs
activities were found to be associated with non-malignant
diseases, including hepatic fibrosis and other fibrotic
diseases. Recently, increasing evidence suggested that
tyrosine kinases inhibitors (TKIs) seemed to be novel
potential drugs for hepatic fibrosis [1]. In preclinical
phase, several Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved TKIs, such as sorafenib, erlotinib, Imatinib,
vatalanib, nilotinib, erotinib and brivanib, exhibited
potential anti-fibrosis effects both in vitro and in vivo
(Figure 1). Beneficial effects have been observed by
clinicians using above TKIs in some patients with tumors

HEPATIC FIBROSIS

hepatic fibrosis, and many animal based preclinical
experiments showed that TKIs did bring great benefits
to hepatic fibrosis [4, 5]. This should be attributed to
its capacity of inhibiting both matrix restructuring and
vascular remodeling [6]. In the following section, we will
summarize preclinical and clinical evidence for TKIs in
management of hepatic fibrosis.

Hepatic fibrosis is defined as the normal liver
architecture is replaced by fibrous tissue, scar and
regenerative nodules, which leads to liver function loss [2].
Hepatic fibrosis could develop to cirrhosis, hepatocellular
carcinoma, or even death. Nowadays, diverse anti-hepatic
fibrotic therapies are not seemingly effective from bench
to bedside [3]. Accumulating evidence suggested that TKs
blocking seems to be a prospective approach to treating

fibrogenesis were unveiled. The activation of hepatic
stellate cells (HSCs) was considered as a key processes
during hepatic fibrogenesis [7-9]. Prior studies have
delineated that TKs play an important role in regulating
HSC activation [10]. Therefore, targeting TK using
inhibitors (TKIs) is considered to be potential approach to
inhibit HSC activation and consequently to treat hepatic
fibrosis [1]. The mostly investigated TKI which exhibited
a high capacity in inhibiting HSC activation is sorafenib.
It was found that sorafenib could inhibit proliferation
of HSCs by downregulating expression of cyclins and
cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and prevent ERK,
Akt and 70-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K) from
phosphorylation [11, 12], [13]. In addition, several other
TKIs, such as imatinib [14] , vatalanib [15-17], nilotinib
[18-22], erlotinib [23, 24] and brivanib [25, 26], were also
found to prevent HSC activation, resulting in less collagen
deposition.
Portal hypertension is a complication defined as a
portal venous pressure gradient exceeding 5 mm which
could leads to liver failure even death [27], thus how to
deal with portal hypertension never fail to attract attention.
Intrahepatic angiogenesis recently is considered to be
involved in sinusoidal resistance and portal hypertension,
and finally promotes hepatic fibrosis progression. Vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), which
belongs to receptor tyrosine kinase, is a key regulator
of physiological angiogenesis. It has been clearly
investigated that TKIs targeting VEGFRs significantly
affected angiogenesis either in tumor or non-malignant.
Thabut D et al. reported that sorafenib is associated with
suppressing intrahepatic angiogenesis and attenuating
hepatic fibrosis [6]. It has been shown that portal pressure
and angiogenesis are reduced and no systemic blood
pressure fluctuation appeared in sorafenib treated bile duct
ligation (BDL) rats [28-30]. Rho kinase activity is crucial
for the effect of sorafenib on intrahepatic angiogenesis
and portal hypertension [31]. Besides, other TKIs, such as
sunitinib, was also showed the ability to reduce portal vein
pressure in cirrhotic rats [29].

on portal pressure in patients with hepatic cirrhosis
(NCT01714609).

TKIs could prevent as well as reverse hepatic
fibrosis
To figure out whether TKIs could prevent or reverse
hepatic fibrosis, J.T. Stefano et al. conducted a study to
evaluate the effects of sorafenib on hepatic fibrosis in an
experimental non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model
rats. Their study demonstrated that sorafenib could prevent
the early stages of fibrosis in NASH model rats [35].
Recently, a study by Ikuo Nakamura et al. also proved
that hepatic fibrosis in mice were attenuated when brivanib
was used at the same time [36]. Above results implied
that TKIs might be a promising therapeutic strategy in
prevention of hepatic fibrosis. Additionally, TKIs had also
been found to make effects on reversing hepatic fibrosis.
In a more previous study, Neef M et al. reported that early
imatinib treatment induced decrease HSCs activity, thus
markedly reverse fibrosis in the first three week after BDL
[37]. However, their study showed that imatinib make
no difference in advanced fibrosis models. In all, above
findings suggested that TKIs could prevent as well as
reverse hepatic fibrosis, implying TKIs may represent a
novel therapeutic approach to treatment of not only HCC
but also hepatic fibrosis.

HEPATOTOXICITY OF TKIS: AN
INEVITABLE ISSUE LIMITING THEIR
CLINICAL APPLICATION
The leading cause for drug withdrawals is drug
toxicity, especially the hepatotoxicity. During the period
1953 to December 2013, 81 medicinal products (18%)
that were withdrawn from the market mainly due to
hepatotoxicity [38]. An analysis revealed that from 1990
to 2006, 14 of 38 drugs (34.2%) were withdrawn due to
hepatotoxicity [39]. As most of TKIs are metabolized
by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme system [40-42],
clinicians should be aware of potential hepatotoxicity
with TKIs in patients with liver dysfunction. TKI related
hepatotoxicity, including elevation of liver enzymes, liver
failure and liver failure induced death, have already been
reported in the medical literature [43]. A recent metaanalysis based on 3691 patients received TKIs treatment
concluded that hepatotoxicity occurred in 23-40% patients
who received TKIs treatment [44]. Additionally, a phase
III trial made by Jordi Bruix et al. addressed that the rate
of discontinuation of sorafenib for HCC patients after
resection or ablation was 50% at a year, far higher than
anticipated, which mainly result from adverse effects.
Above result indicated that TKIs seemed not tolerable in
potentially cured patients [45]. Thus, hepatotoxicity of
TKIs is an inevitable issue limiting their application in

Anti-fibrotic activity of TKIs observed in clinical
studies
Reduction of portal pressure has been observed
in sorafenib treated patients clinically, with a 36%
portal venous flow decreasing at least [32]. Similarly,
Pinter M et al. also reported that a two-week sorafenib
treatment exert positive effect on portal hypertension in
HCC patients with hepatic fibrosis [33]. Additionally,
hepatopulmonary shunt reduction has also been observed
in sorafenib treated patients with hepatic cirrhosis, which
might greatly improve the prognosis of these patients [34].
Recently, a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial
has been conducted to evaluate the effects of sorafenib

we summarized that rare but serious and potentially fatal

cancer (n = 1), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n = 5),
melanoma (n = 3), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n
= 2), ovarian cancer (n = 1), renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n
= 2), thyroid cancer (n = 1) [48-66]. Our results revealed
that incidences of all-grade elevations of these markers are
relatively high in patients treated with sorafenib, especially
in HCC patients, who always had a background of chronic
liver disease (Figure 2). Moreover, liver failure has also
been reported in some cases. P. Ghatalia et al reported that
the overall rate of sorafenib-induced liver failure is 1.5%,
suggesting TKI-related hepatotoxicity should be paid close
attention.
In addition, other TKIs were also observed to exhibit
hepatotoxicity. For instance, Arora, A. K. et al. reported
that erlotinib could induce abnormalities of liver function,
they also reported a case of erlotinib-induced acute
hepatitis [67]. A recent clinical study implied that use of
lapatinib in combination with dexamethasone increased
the incidence of hepatotoxicity in metastatic breast
cancer patients [68]. And another more recent pre-clinical
study reported severe and fatal cases of liver injury with
lapatinib use [69]. A meta-analysis revealed that pazopanib
significantly increased overall risk of hepatotoxicity but
not increased risk of fatal hepatotoxicity [70]. Moreover,

TKI related hepatotoxicity reported in literature
Sorafenib is the only TKI which was approved to be
used in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
Whereas in some clinical cases, hepatotoxicity was also
reported during administration of sorafenib. Schramm C et
al. [46] reported that sorafenib could induce liver failure,
and Llanos L et al. [47] also reported a case of sorafenibinduced severe hepatotoxicity in a 73-year-old man.
Hepatotoxicity of sofafenib often manifests as elevations
of hepatic biochemical markers, including alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin [43].
Cheng AL et al. even reported that the incidence of AST
elevation could be above 40%. To explore the incidence of
hepatotoxicity in patients received sorafenib treatment, we
therefore conducted a meta-analysis based on 19 clinical
trials, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 1);
biliary tract cancer (n = 1), breast cancer (n = 2), colorectal

acute liver failure caused by imatinib and sunitinib
have also been observed in some cases [43, 71, 72].
However, there is a lack of evidence about TKI-induced
hepatotoxicity in patients with hepatic fibrosis.
It should be pointed out that patients in pre-approval
clinical trials are often well-selected, whereas TKIs
therapy may increase the likelihood of toxicity and bring
down the probability of benefits in less selected patients
[73]. Thus, TKI related hepatotoxicity in clinical use need
further in-depth discussion.

may result from aberrant drug metabolism [77]. It has been
pointed out that several factors may affect susceptibility
to hepatotoxicity from TKIs, for instance, patients with
chronic infection such as hepatitis B or underlying
inflammatory liver conditions were indicated to be more
vulnerable to liver injury [78]. Additionally, it has been
demonstrated that genetic polymorphisms of the major
histocompatibility molecules HLA plays an important
role in DILI [79]. Some evidence suggested that the
HFE rs707889 TT genotype might account for elevation
of ALT treating with pazopanib and UGT1A1*28 was
found to be associated with elevation of bilirubin [80, 81].
Thus, genetic biomarkers might be a viable approach to
assessing risks of DILI.
Moreover, advanced age and female gender
contribute to higher risks for DILI, this may due to CYP
(cytochrome P450) activity diminishes with ages and CYP
plays an important role in metabolism of exogenous agents
[82, 83]. It has been shown in a retrospective study that
CYP2D6 genotype alone made no difference in higher risk
of hepatotoxicity, however, patients harboring the allele *5
and *10 of CYP2D6 gene were classified as intermediate
or poor metabolizers and were more vulnerable to
recurrent and severe hepatotoxicity with gefitinib
treatment [84]. Besides, gefitinib-related hepatotoxicity is
more common in Asians than non-Asians, which may also
result from CYP polymorphisms among different ethnic
groups [85, 86].

Mechanism of TKI related hepatotoxicity
Several hypotheses have been proposed on the
mechanism of TKI related hepatotoxicity. It is supposed
to be originated from two aspects: one is involved in
direct toxicity via formation of reactive metabolites (RM)
including unstable conjugates, reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and other free radicals, another is associated with
indirect toxicity via secondary immune reactions [74]. It
has been demonstrated that various TKIs could generate
RM leading to the rise of potential hepatotoxicity risk. The
main metabolites of erlotinib, for example, is epoxide and
quinone-imine, which result in injury of liver, intestine and
lung. Additionally, CYP3A4 enzyme is found to be related
to catalysis of liver and intestine RM in several TKIs such
as erlotinib and gefitinib [75].
Accumulating evidences suggest that metabolites
of TKIs have higher likelihood of causing multi-organs
injury. As the liver is the predominant site for bioactivation
and detoxification for TKIs, any potential toxicities
generating during the process would bring a localized
damage. It has been demonstrated in several studies that
hepatic metabolisms of TKIs are likely to cause elevation
of liver enzymes, liver failure and fatal DILI (druginduced liver injury) [76]. It has been revealed that the
overall risk of developing hepatotoxicity was more than
two fold higher in patients with TKIs therapy than control.
The onset of TKIs related hepatotoxicity is highly
variable, whereas it has been found that hepatotoxicity
usually occurred with the median of seven weeks after
TKIs treatment [43]. The majority of patients would
present with asymptomatic ALT abnormalities, while
seldom would develop to fatal DILI. Despite the fact that
fatality from TK inhibitor-induced hepatotoxicity is much
rarer compared to hepatotoxic drugs in other classes,
it is also very important to point out that some clinical
cases develop into unfavorable events including hepatic
cirrhosis and even liver failure.

TKIs combination regimen: better treatment than
single agent?
Increasing evidence suggested that hepatic fibrosis
is a systematic disease with aberrant microenvironments,
including abnormal expression HSCs, ECs (liver
sinusoidal endothelial cells) and KCs (Kupffer cells) and
interaction among them. TKIs combination treatment
could simultaneously direct against several targets and
therefore achieved superior effects to single agents. It
has been demonstrated by Cheng Liu et al. that sorafenib
plus GdCl3 significantly inhibited angiogenesis,
proinflammatory cytokines, and the interactions among
HSCs, SECs and KCs as well as ameliorated the increases
in ALT, AST and TBIL in dimethylnitrosamine (DMN)induced hepatic fibrosis rats compared to either single
agent, suggesting TKIs combination regimen is a more
potent therapy in hepatic fibrosis [87]. Naoki Yamamoto
et al. proved that DFX (deferasirox) in combination with
sorafenib could prevent hepatic fibrosis and attenuate
adverse effects better than single agent treatment in
HCC rats [88]. However, few studies indicated that TKIs
combination regimen is better than single agent when
treating hepatic fibrosis patients, which warrant further
research.

Prediction of TKI related hepatotoxicity
TKI related hepatotoxicity is often with a variable
latency and lacks a significant correlation between drug
dose and frequency to severity of hepatotoxicity, which

SELECTIVE DELIVERY OF TKIS: A
POTENTIAL STRATEGY FOR REDUCING
TKI RELATED HEPATOTOXICITY

[94]. Size and functionalization of nanoparticles decide
its distribution in different organs. Therefore, organic
nanoparticles such as lipid could be considered as a novel
nanocarriers. Chai et al. also applied RGD peptide-labeled
liposomes to deliver oxymatrine (OM) specifically into
HSCs. OM is an herbal medicinal product that could
bring benefits to hepatic fibrosis in rats. And in this
study, researchers formed an OM-liposomes compound
and coupled the RGD peptides and the OM-liposomes
afterwards. This compound showed excellent ability of
reducing collagen deposition and hepatic fibrosis related
genes expression, suggesting liposomes could be a
wonderful candidate for delivery of antifibrotic drugs [95].

Overwhelming evidences suggest that hepatic
stellate cells (HSC) play a pivotal role in hepatic
fibrogenesis [10, 89]. Activation of HSC results in wound
healing reaction and formation of myofibroblasts. HSC
is a major source of the production of various profibrotic
cytokines as well as extracellular matrix proteins. Since
tyrosine kinase-regulated pathways are associated with
almost every cell type of the body, TKIs in non-diseased
organs may exert serious adverse effects. Thus, it seems
that selective TKIs specifically targeting HSCs may be a
good option to improve anti-fibrotic efficacy via increasing
local drug levels in HSC and decreasing drug levels
elsewhere. To optimize the therapy of hepatic fibrosis,
targeting to HSC has been explored for years. And here
are several approaches to HSC targeted therapy have been
developed [90, 91].

PERSPECTIVES
It cannot be denied that TKIs make a great
contribution to transforming many cancers from a death
sentence to a chronic illness. Accumulating evidences
have demonstrated that multitargeted TKIs are capable
of bringing benefit not only to malignant tumor but also
fibrotic disease. During fibrogenesis, many intracellular
signaling pathways are inappropriately activated, in which
TKs plays a significant role. Thus, TKIs seems to be a
novel potential treatment for fibrotic disease. And it has
been identified in multiple preclinical studies that TKIs
could either prevent or reverse hepatic fibrosis. As a result,
based on the advantages of TKIs, targeted therapy might
become major approaches for treating hepatic fibrosis in
future.
However, it should never fail to point out that
toxicity of TKIs is a serious problem and hence hinter the
TKIs application. In spite of the common adverse effects
of TKIs including rash, gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue,
edema, and neurological symptoms are mild and tolerable
for patients, some severe effects like liver function
impairment and even acute liver failure have been reported
clinically. Generally, most existing TKIs have no specific
selectivity between the normal cells and the tumor or
fibrotic cells, implying potential systematic adverse effect.
Increasing evidence from preclinical studies implied that
discontinuation of TKIs was resulted from intolerable side
effects thus limited its application in patients with only
hepatic fibrosis. Therefore, the adverse effects of TKIs
especially hepatotoxicity is the problem demanding most
concern.
Developing TKIs that target only specific cells
should be paid close attention. As we all know that TKIs
withdrawals resulting from hepatotoxicity are quite
common, TKIs with cell selectivity may decrease the
risk of toxicity. Moreover, TKIs might exert excessive
economic pressure on patients, which also would put sand
on their applications for hepatic fibrosis. Given together,
TKIs, as discussed in this review, are novel potential drugs
for hepatic fibrosis, but still existing lots of problems to

Selective protein carriers
It has been demonstrated that receptors such as
PDGF-β receptor are highly upregulated on activated
HSC, thus using albumin-based carriers that bind to these
receptors could be a novel approach. In experimental
animal models of hepatic fibrosis, it has been revealed that
these carriers open the opportunity to delivery majority
of anti-fibrotic compounds to HSC. In the past few years,
drugs like kinase inhibitors affecting PDGF-β signaling
pathway were successfully delivered to these cells in
experimental animals [91]. Homing device of mannose
6-phosphate (M6P) is also a significant method to deliver
drugs to HSC. Researchers have combined M6P with a
RGD homing device, and it has been proved that M6PRGD construction is more effective in inhibiting hepatic
fibrosis than M6P or RGD alone, suggesting that M6PRGD is also a good approach to target HSC selectively
[92]. PDGFR-β is one of the most important pro-fibrotic
TKs in hepatic fibrosis signals. This pathway can be inhibit
by imatinib, however, this kind of drugs would bring
severe side effect. PAP19 is an imatinib-like drug that
inhibits the PDGFR-β. Gonzalo T et al. have demonstrated
that PAP19 reduce fibrotic markers in HSC and target
HSC specifically in a rat model of hepatic fibrosis via the
M6PHSA carrier [93].

Other nanoparticle-based drug vehicles
Nanoparticles are frequently defined as particles
sized from one up to 500 nm. It is widely known that
metal-based nanotherapeutics have brought about a
series of achievements such as computerized tomography
