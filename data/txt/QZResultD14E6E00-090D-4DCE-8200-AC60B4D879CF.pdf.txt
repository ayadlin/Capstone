ABSTRACT
Backgrounds: Recent clinical trials have shown that immune-checkpoint blockade
yields remarkable response in a subset of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
However, few studies directly focus on the association between epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) mutational status and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PDL1) expression. We examined whether PD-L1 is related to clinicopathologic factors
and prognosis in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with EGFR-tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs).
Methods: One-hundred and seventy patients with advanced NSCLC were explored.
Paraffin-embedded tumour sections were stained with PD-L1 antibody. EGFR mutation
was examined by fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The
correlations between PD-L1 expression and EGFR status and survival parameters
were analyzed.
Results: The overall frequency of PD-L1 over-expression was 65.9% (112/170).
In lung adenocarcinoma, PD-L1 tended to be associated with mutant EGFR (PD-L1
overexpression in mutant and wild-type EGFR, 64/89 (71.9%) vs. 32/56 (57.1%),
respectively; p=0.067). Subgroup analyses showed that high PD-L1 expression was
associated with significantly shorter overall survival (OS) in EGFR wild-type patients
(p=0.029) but not in EGFR mutant patients (p=0.932) treated with EGFR-TKIs. Even
more, for EGFR mutant patients, higher expression of PD-L1 might only signal better
outcome with TKIs.
Conclusions: High PD-L1 expression was likely to be associated with the presence
of EGFR mutation in advanced lung adenocarcinoma. For EGFR wild-type patients,
the PD-L1 over expression can be considered as a poor prognostic indicator of OS.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Lung cancer, especially non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), is currently the leading cause of cancer-related
death worldwide [1]. Recent advancements in targeted
therapy have led to a major paradigm shift in the treatment
of advanced NSCLC [2]. Molecularly targeted drugs such
as erlotinib and gefitinib have thus greatly improved the
clinical outcome of advanced NSCLC patients harboring
sensitive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene
mutations [3]. Two major types of EGFR kinase mutations
include exon-19 deletions and L858R mutation in exon
21 [4, 5].
Programmed death 1 (PD-1) is a co-inhibitory
receptor expressed on the membrane of activated T and
B cells [6], which plays a crucial role in tumor immune
escape [7, 8]. Programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is
the major ligand for PD-1 and is expressed in a variety of
cancers [7, 9]. PD-L1 has been shown to be involved in
the negative regulation of immune response through PD-1
receptor and has been thought to be an important strategy
for cancer cells to evade host immune surveillance. Cancer
cells expressing PD-L1 have been shown to increase
apoptosis of antigen-specific human T-cell clones and to
inhibit CD4 and CD8 T-cell activation in vitro [10-12].
Currently, some studies demonstrated that PD-L1
was expressed in 19.63%-65.38% of NSCLC [2, 13-16].
Several studies suggested that PD-L1 expression portended
inconsistent survival outcomes [17]. For example, a study
showed that tumor with a high level of PD-L1 expression
was associated with significantly shorter overall survival
(OS) in NSCLC patients [2], while another report showed
positive PD-L1 was significantly associated with better
survival outcome [15]. Now, the molecular regulatory
mechanism of PD-L1 isn’t comprehensive enough,
though two studies found that mutant EGFR could induce
PD-L1 expression in vitro and vivo, and EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) could down-regulate PDL1 expression [2, 16]. It is therefore of significance to
study the association between EGFR driver mutation and
PD-L1. Even more, the incidence of EGFR mutations is
higher in East Asian patients than in Caucasian patients
(30% versus 8%) [4], and there are no studies examining
the relationship between PD-L1 expression and efficacy in
patients treated with EGFR-TKIs in China. Therefore,we
tried to investigate the impact of PD-L1 expression on
EGFR-TKIs’ efficacy and prognosis in Chinese advanced
NSCLC patients, emphasizing on the EGFR mutational
status.

Patient characteristics
A total of 170 eligible patients with advanced
NSCLC were included in the present study (Figure 1).
The mean age at diagnosis was 57.09 years (range, 32–80
years) (Table 1). Seventy-seven (45.3%) of the patients
were female and ninety-three (54.7%) were male. Fiftyseven (33.5%) patients were smokers. Nine (5.3%)
patients and 161 (94.7%) patients were diagnosed at stage
IIIB and stage IV, respectively. In the current research,
99 patients harbored EGFR mutation and the remaining
71 patients were EGFR wild type. With regard to EGFR
mutation status, 40 patients harbored a deletion in exon 19
and 47 patients had an L858R missense mutation in exon
21. 12 were uncommon mutation.

Correlations between PD-L1 expression and
baseline characteristics
Immunohistochemical staining for PD-L1 was
found at the membrane or in the cytoplasm (or both) of
tumor cells (Figure 2A). As shown in Table 1, PD-L1 is
over expressed in 65.9% (112/170) of advanced NSCLC
patients. The relationship between PD-L1 expression
and age, gender, histopathological type, tumor stage and
EGFR mutational status was not significant, except for the
line of EGFR TKIs (P = 0.041). However, in subgroup of
lung adenocarcinoma, there was a borderline difference
between PD-L1 expression level and EGFR mutational
status (32/56 (57.1%) for wild type and 64/89 (71.9%) for
mutant type, respectively, p=0.067).

Relationships between PD-L1 expression and the
EGFR-TKIs’ efficacy
The association between the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs
with PD-L1 expression as well as other clinicpathologic
factors in advanced NSCLC patients was summarized in
Table 2. There was no significant relationship between
objective response rate (ORR) and PD-L1 expression,
as well as age, gender, histopathological type, stage and
TKI line. However, patients with mutant EGFR had
better ORR than those with wild-type EGFR (odds ratio
(OR), 0.266; 95% confidence interval (95%CI), 0.114 to
0.621; p =0.002) and non-smokers also had higher ORR
than smokers did (OR, 4.667; 95% CI, 1.716 to 12.693;
p = 0.003). These results were in accordance with the
results of multivariate analysis. Besides, we examined
the association between a variety of factors and disease
control rate (DCR). We found that there was no significant
difference between DCR and PD-L1 status (OR, 0.783;
14210

Oncotarget

95% CI, 0.350 to 1.751; p =0.551). Whereas, DCR was
significantly higher in women than that in men (OR,
3.478; 95% CI, 1.407 to 8.600; P=0.007), in neversmokers than that in smokers (OR, 3.55; 95% CI, 1.589 to
7.930; P=0.002), and in those with EGFR mutation than
that in those EGFR with wild type (OR, 0.092; 95% CI,
0.033 to 0.256; P<0.001) (Table 2). And the multivariate
analysis revealed that EGFR mutation positivity was an
independent factor (OR, 0.113; 95% CI, 0.038 to 0.342;
P=0.007). We further divided patients into two subgroups:
(I) EGFR wild type (n=71) and (II) EGFR mutant (n=99).
No significant differences in two subgroups were found
between PD-L1 expression and ORR (OR, 0.854; 95% CI,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

0.187 to 3.891; P=0.838 and OR, 1.765; 95% CI, 0.715 to
4.353; P=0.218 for group I and group II, respectively), as
well as PD-L1 expression and DCR (OR, 1.169; 95% CI,
0.436 to 3.137; P=0.756 and OR, 0.604; 95% CI, 0.096
to 3.822; P=0.593 for group I and group II, respectively).

Survival analyses is in NSCLC patients
The median overall survival of the whole patients
was 39.9 months. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that
overall patients with positive PD-L1 and negative PDL1 expression had no significant difference in OS and
progression-free survival (PFS) (Figure 3A, 3D).To

investigate the PD-L1’s clinical significance, we further
divided the patients into two groups: EGFR mutation
and EGFR wild type. In EGFR mutation group, PFS and
OS of patients with positive PD-L1 tended to be longer
than patients with negative PD-L1, although statistical
significance was not achieved (Figure 3B, 3E). In EGFR
wild type group, negative PD-L1 patients have longer OS
than positive-PD-L1 patients (P=0.029) (Figure 3C), while
no significant difference in PFS was observed (Figure 3F).
Exploratory analysis was done to validate the prognostic
role of PD-L1 in subgroups defined by age, sex, smoking,
pathology, stage of disease, EGFR mutation, and EGFRTKI’s lines (Figure 4). We found that patients with positive
PD-L1 expression had signal better prognosis in EGFR
mutation subgroup, contrary to EGFR wild-type group. To
determine the prognostic value of PD-L1 expression, we
carried out univariate and multivariate analyses using the
Cox regression model. For PFS and OS, EGFR mutation
remained the independent factor for better prognosis
(hazard ratio (HR), 0.419; 95% CI, 0.262-0.672; P <0.001
for PFS and HR, 0.499; 95% CI, 0.264-0.942; P=0.032
for OS, respectively) (Table 3). In subgroup multivariate
analysis, we found that the high level PD-L1 can be

considered as a poor prognostic indicator of OS for EGFR
wild-type patients (HR, 3.738; 95% CI, 1.341-10.419;
P=0.012) (Supplementary table 1).

DISCUSSION
NSCLC is partially characterized by driver
mutation-defined molecular subsets, each with distinct
clinicopathologic features and potentials for targeted
therapies. In the present study, we found that PD-L1 was
over-expressed in 65.9% of advanced NSCLC samples
and positive PD-L1 tended to be associated with EGFR
mutation. We also revealed that there was no significant
correlation between expression of PD-L1 and curative
effect of EGFR TKIs (ORR and DCR). In EGFR mutation
group, PFS and OS of patients positive for PD-L1 tended
to be signal better than that of patients who were negative,
although statistical significance was not achieved. For
patients with wild type EGFR, PD-L1-negative NSCLC
patients had longer overall survival than PD-L1-positive
ones.
In previous studies, researchers have demonstrated
that activation of the EGFR pathway induced PD-L1

expression [2, 16, 18], and found PD-L1 was significantly
higher in patients with the following characteristics:
women, never smokers and with adenocarcinoma [2, 16].
All these characteristics are hallmarks of EGFR mutations.
In present study, we also found a borderline association
between high PD-L1 expression and EGFR mutation in
lung adenocarcinoma, while no significant relationship
between ages, gender, smoking history and PD-L1
expression was found in NSCLC patients. The difference
between the present and previous studies may be due
to several reasons. First, the sample size varied among
different studies and all data were retrospectively collected,
resulting in potential bias. Second, the heterogeneity of
baseline characteristics among these studies had also
affected their outcomes, such as pathological stage and
geographical distribution. Third, the threshold of positive
PD-L1 expression was also different from each other in
these studies. Fourth, the specificity and reproducibility
of the commercially available antibodies and variations
in Immunohistochemical technique weren’t thoroughly
assessed [15]. Thus, for future studies, more efforts to
standardize a quantitative assay for PD-L1 expression are
warranted.
In EGFR wild-type lung cancer, immune evasion
induced by PD-L1 played an important role. PD-1/PDL1 pathway has been recognized as a key mechanism of
immune evasion. Cancer cells can evade host immune
systems by expressing certain ligands to down-regulate

cytotoxic T lymphocytes through inhibitory pathways,
which are usually initiated by ligand-receptor interactions
[19] . PD-1 is one immune checkpoint expressed on the
surface of T-cells upon activation [20]. PD-L1 is the
major ligand for PD-1 and is expressed in various type
of cancers [9] .PD-1/PD-L1 interaction is regarded as an
inhibitory checkpoint for T-cell activation at its initial
stage. In the present report, our data revealed that high
PD-L1 expression was correlated with poor prognosis
in EGFR wild-type patients but not in EGFR mutant
population. This finding indicated that EGFR wild-type
NSCLC failed to be controlled by the immune system
which is inhibited by PD-L1 mediated antitumor activity.
Then cancer cells can evade host immune responses by
expressing PD-L1 to down-regulate T-cell activation in
tumorous microenvironment [9], allowing cancer cells
to survive and progress. Therefore, PD-L1 status was a
significant prognostic factor for patients with EGFR wild
type. This implicated that for this subset of population
(EGFR wild-type and PD-L1 over-expression), PD-L1
blocker may be an alternative therapeutic strategy. For
future clinical applications, more evidences to verify the
feasibility are warranted.
According to previous studies, we could explain
why patients with positive for PD-L1 expression tended
to have better OS than PD-L1 negative ones in EGFR
mutant NSCLC patients. The most possible reason was
the cross interaction between EGFR pathway and PD-L1.

A study by Azuma K et al. [2] found that inhibition of
EGFR signaling with erlotinib led to down-regulation of
the expression of PD-L1 in EGFR mutant NSCLC cells
but not in those with wild-type EGFR, indicating that
the expression of PD-L1 might be dependent on EGFR
signaling conferred by activating EGFR mutations. In
another research, Akbay EA et al. [16] also found that PDL1 expression was reduced by EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC
cell lines with activated EGFR. Therefore, for EGFR
mutant NSCLC patients, EGFR-TKIs could perform a
dual therapeutic response. The down-regulation of PD-L1
expression and the consequent restoration of an antitumor
immune response might contribute to the durable
therapeutic response. EGFR activation up regulated PDL1 through MAPK signaling pathway. As previously
reported, EGFR remarkably increased the activity of
ERK1/2 and AKT which are involved in the proliferation,
anti-apoptosis, and invasion of tumor cells [21, 22]. Chen
N et al. [23] further demonstrated that the up-regulation of
PD-L1 mediated by EGFR activation was associated with
the activation of ERK1/2/c-Jun. By inhibiting p-ERK1/2,
PD-L1 decreased following p-ERK1/2/p-Jun downregulation in a clear dose-dependent manner [23]. This
detailed mechanism confirmed that EGFR mutant NSCLC
patients may benefit not only from direct tumor killing
effect of EGFR-TKIs but also indirectly from immune
enhancement after EGFR-TKIs treatment.
As we known, targeted therapy usually have rapid
and impressive response rates but modest progression-free
survival while immunotherapy can achieve durable tumor
control but associated with lower response rates [24].
To address this, investigators have proposed combining
these strategies. There is a scientific rationale supporting
the combination of targeted therapy and immunotherapy
[25]. For patients with melanoma, the concept of potential
synergy with BRAF-targeted therapy and immunotherapy
is being empirically investigated in clinical trials [26-28];
however, much remains to be learned. Response data from
these initial trials are not mature, and additional trials will
be needed to determine the appropriate sequence, schedule,
and duration of therapy if there is evidence of synergy.
Yet, there were no data about the combinatorial strategies
of EGFR-TKIs with anti-PD-1/PD-L1. While there were
no direct verified evidences, this combining therapy may
be an alternative strategy in EGFR mutant NSCLC. In
the future, more well-designed in vitro and vivo studies to
explore molecular mechanisms of combining EGFR-TKIs
and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies are urgently required.
Randomized clinical trials to instruct how best to combine
therapeutic agents are also needed.
Currently, though gefitinib and erlotinib are regarded
as the first line treatment of classical EGFR mutant
NSCLC patients, a majority of them eventually develop
secondary resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib. Previous
treatment options for EGFR-TKIs resistance include CO1686 [29], AZD9291 [30] and HM61713 [31] for EGFR
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

T790M and EGFR-TKIs plus c-met inhibitors for c-met
amplification [32]. However, the role of immunotherapy
in EGFR-TKIs-resistant patients has not been revealed.
Chen N et al. [23] demonstrated that the protein level
of PD-L1 in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cell lines (PC-9,
HCC827 and H1975) was significantly higher than that
in EGFR-wild type cell lines (A539, H1993). Moreover,
the expression of PD-L1 was the highest in resistant cells
(H1975 cells, with EGFR-T790M mutation). Anti- PD-1/
PD-L1 axis could significantly decrease the viability of
gefitinib resistant H1975 cells. This implied that blockade
of PD-1/PD-L1 might be a promising optional treatment
for NSCLC patients with EGFR mutation, especially for
EGFR-TKIs resistant NSCLC patients. Future clinical
studies are needed to test the feasibility.
Notably, this is the first study to assess the
relationship between PD-L1 expression and prognosis
as well as efficacy in Chinese advanced NSCLC patients
with treatment of EGFR-TKIs. We prove that high PDL1 expression is likely to be associated with the presence
of EGFR mutation in advanced lung adenocarcinoma.
Moreover, PD-L1 over-expression can be considered as
a poor prognostic indicator of OS in EGFR wild-type
patients treated with EGFR-TKIs.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
A total of 3543 consecutive NSCLC patients who
have taken oral EGFR-TKIs at Sun Yat-sen University
Cancer Center (Guangzhou, China) from January 2008
to March 2014 were screened in the study. Patients
were recruited if they met the following conditions:
1, treated with EGFR-TKIs; 2, stage 3b/4 NSCLC or
recurrent disease after surgery or chemotherapy; 3,
with known EGFR mutational status; 4, having detailed
medical records and had enough tumor tissue samples
for immunohistochemical staining of PD-L1. Finally, a
total of 170 patients were eligible. Figure 1 summarized
the process of patients’ selection. Baseline clinical and
pathological features were collected, as well as tissue
specimens from surgery or biopsy. The clinicopathological
features of the patients included age, gender, smoking
status, pathological type, Union for International Cancer
Control (UICC) stage (the seventh edition), EGFR
mutation status and EGFR-TKI treatment history. Fifty
years old was chosen as the cutoff for dividing the
high or low age group (50y was low and 50y was high,
respectively). Smoking history was noted as yes or no
(no-smoking refers to patients who had never smoked
in their lifetime). Pathological subtype was divided into
adenocarcinoma or non- adenocarcinoma. All patients
were restaged according to the seventh edition of UICC
14216

Oncotarget

Staging System for NSCLC. EGFR exon 19 deletions or
exon 21 base substitutions were considered as classical
EGFR mutations by fluorescent quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Sun Yat-Sen University
Cancer Center (Guangzhou, China). All the patients had
provided written informed consent before samples were
collected.

OS was defined as the time from diagnosis to the end of
the follow-up (August 2014). And PFS was the time from
beginning to taking TKI to recurrence or last follow-up.
OS and PFS analyses were estimated with Kaplan-Meier
method and multivariable analyses were performed to
assess survival difference. The results of ORR and DCR
were reported with OR and its 95% CI, while prognostic
results were reported with HR and its 95% CI. OR > 1
indicated that EGFR-TKI was more effective in PDL1 positive patients. HR < 1 implied a lower risk of
progression or death for patients with positive expression
of PD-L1. A two sided p-value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Immunohistochemistry analyses
Immunohistochemical staining was performed using
rabbit monoclonal anti-human antibody (E1L3N™, Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, 1:200) for testing
the expression of PD-L1 in human NSCLC specimens.
Five-μm-thick Sections were cut from the formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor block and then routinely
deparaffined and rehydrated. For antigen retrieval, slides
were heated in a microwave oven for 30 minutes in citrate
buffer solution (pH=7.4) and cooled slowly at room
temperature for 20 minutes. After blocking the activity
of endogenous peroxidase with 3% hydrogen peroxide
for 8 minutes, the sections were treated with primary
antibodies and incubated for overnight (more than 12
hours). Subsequently, the slides were rinsed in PBS three
times and incubated in HRR-linked secondary antibodies.
After incubation, slides were washed again with PBS and
then visualized using diaminobenzidine. Finally, Mayer’s
hematoxylin was used to counterstain the sections, which
were then dehydrated and mounted.
Two pathologists who were blinded to the clinical or
pathological information of these patients independently
assess the expression of PD-L1. Semiquantitative H score
(maximum value of 300 corresponding to 100% of tumor
cells positive for PD-L1 with an overall staining intensity
score of 3) was defined as multiplying the percentage of
stained cells by an intensity score (0, absent; 1,weak; 2,
moderate; and 3, strong). A 5% proportion of membranepositive tumor cells which were defined as H-score ≥ 5
have been used as cutoff for PD-L1 positivity [33, 34],
as this cut-point is reported to be associated with clinical
response to anti-PD-1 therapy [34].
