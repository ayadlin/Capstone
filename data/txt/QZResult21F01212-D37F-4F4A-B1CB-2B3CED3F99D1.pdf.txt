ABSTRACT
Purpose: Effective systemic therapeutic options are limited for bladder cancer.
In this preclinical study we tested whether bladder cancer gene alterations may
be predictive of treatment response. Experimental design: We performed genomic
profiling of two bladder cancer patient derived tumor xenografts (PDX). We optimized
the exome sequence analysis method to overcome the mouse genome interference.
Results: We identified a number of somatic mutations, mostly shared by the primary
tumors and PDX. In particular, BLCAb001, which is less responsive to cisplatin than
BLCAb002, carried non-sense mutations in several genes associated with cisplatin
resistance, including MLH1, BRCA2, and CASP8. Furthermore, RNA-Seq analysis
revealed the overexpression of cisplatin resistance associated genes such as SLC7A11,
TLE4, and IL1A in BLCAb001. Two different PIK3CA mutations, E542K and E545K,
were identified in BLCAb001 and BLCAb002, respectively. Thus, we tested whether the
genomic profiling was predictive of response to a dual PI3K/mTOR targeting agent,
LY3023414. Despite harboring similar PIK3CA mutations, BLCAb001 and BLCAb002
exhibited differential response, both in vitro and in vivo. Sustained target modulation
was observed in the sensitive model BLCAb002 but not in BLCAb001, as well as
decreased autophagy. Interestingly, computational modelling of mutant structures
and affinity binding to PI3K revealed that E542K mutation was associated with weaker
drug binding than E545K. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the presence of
activating PIK3CA mutations may not necessarily predict in vivo treatment response
to PI3K targeted therapies, while specific gene alterations may be predictive for
cisplatin response in bladder cancer models and, potentially, in patients as well.

INTRODUCTION

mTOR pathways in post-cisplatin bladder cancer has
been tested, but has not been associated with improved
clinical outcome [14]. Accordingly, more clinically and
molecularly relevant models are necessary to better
understand the molecular alterations associated with drug
response, and to develop more effective personalized
therapies for MIBC.
In this study, we characterized two PDX tumors
recently established in our lab by genomic profiling.
As previously reported, BLCAb001 is less cisplatin
responsive as compared to BLCAb002 [15], and carries
specific cisplatin resistance markers, such as a caspase 8
mutation and over expression of the cystine transporter
xCT. Genomic analysis also revealed that both BLCAb001
and BLCAb002 present common PIK3CA E542K and
E545K driver mutations, respectively. However, the
treatment response to the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
LY3023414 (LY414) was found to be significantly
hampered in BLCAb001, suggesting the presence of
alternative pathways. Overall, our data suggest that a
comprehensive profiling, rather than solely mutational
analysis, may predict response to PI3K/mTOR targeted
therapies in bladder cancer.

Bladder cancer, with ~380,000 new cases per year
and 15,000 deaths, stands as the ninth most common
cancer worldwide. Histologically, more than 90% of the
cases are urothelial carcinoma and at time of diagnosis 7585% of tumors are non-muscle invasive cancer (NMIBC).
Approximately 60-70% of NMIBC recurs within one year
and 10-20% will progress to muscle invasive disease.
Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) has the worst
prognosis, with a five-year survival rate of less than 50%.
Treatment options for MIBC remain cisplatin-based
regimen [1]. Therefore, there is a need to develop more
clinical relevant models to understand the biology and
develop effective therapeutic options for patients with
MIBC.
Patient derived tumor xenografts (PDX) have
become accepted preclinical models because of their
retained original tumor heterogeneity and genetic makeup, suggesting a more reliable drug development tool
as compared to tumor cell lines [2, 3]. To date, there is
a limited number of established bladder cancer PDX
models [4] that are molecularly characterized and
available for testing drug resistance and sensitivity. Recent
high throughput genomic studies have revealed several
gene and pathway alterations associated with MIBC
[5, 6], including PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK/MEK/
RAS pathways as drivers of bladder cancer progression
and potential targets for therapeutic interventions [3].
The genomic landscape in MIBC includes alteration
of 9 oncogenes and 23 tumor suppressor genes. The
reported top five mutated oncogenes are PIK3CA (920%), FGFR3 (5-20%), ERBB3 (11%), RXRA (9%), and
ERBB2 (8%) [5]. Among the tumor suppressors, the top
5 gene alterations include TP53 (24-56%), MLL (27%),
ARID1A (25%), KDM6A (24%), and TSC1 (11-16%)
[5]. The genetic characterization mutations reported
in bladder cancer have contributed to the molecular
subtyping of this disease: FGFR3 and TP53 mutations in
UroA and UroB cluster [7], FGFR3 mutation in Cluster I
[6], FGFR3 and TSC1 mutations in the basal and luminal
phenotype [8, 9]. This molecular classification, combined
with histopathology analysis, provides the opportunity to
develop more effective personalized therapies for bladder
cancer patients.
Cisplatin based treatment options have improved
the survival in bladder cancer. However, patients
eventually develop resistance to treatment and disease
progression. Several reports have revealed different
potential mechanisms responsible for intrinsic and
acquired drug resistance including cisplatin binding,
metabolism, transport [10], and intracellular sequestration
[11, 12]. As a potential marker for cisplatin resistance,
differential expression of GSH synthesis regulating the
cystine/glutamate exchanger protein, xCT, has also been
reported in bladder cancer [13]. In addition, targeting

RESULTS
Somatic mutations in primary tumors and PDXs
We recently established two PDXs, BLCAb001
and BLCA002, from two patients undergoing cystectomy
for urothelial carcinoma [15]. Based on the previously
reported difference in cisplatin sensitivity between the
two models, we decided to perform a genomic profiling of
the original tumors and the derived PDXs. Using a highthroughput paired-end sequencing approach, we generated
84 to 330 million of 100-bp reads per sample. For nonPDX samples, over 98% of the reads were successfully
mapped to the human reference by using BWA. For PDX
samples, the mapping rates were 94.5% and 86.6% with
human reference. After mapping to the human and mouse
combined reference, the mapping rates for these two PDXs
increased to 99.1% and 99.2%. All samples reached the
designed goal of 80% of the targeted regions covered with
at least 30X coverage (Table S1).
Filtering out mouse contamination was a critical
step in order to obtain accurate mutation calls in the PDX
samples. In a test run on the unfiltered data, we identified
4,276 and 16,861 SNVs in BLCAb001 and BLCAb002,
respectively (Figure 1A). The majority of these SNVs was
not identified in the primary tumor and was likely caused
by mouse contamination. After filtering out mouse reads,
most of these suspicious mutation calls disappeared and
the remaining mutations were highly consistent with the
matched primary tumor. For BLCAb001, we identified

1,008 SNVs and 5 Indels from the primary and PDX
and 1,101 SNVs and 14 Indels from BLCAb002. The
identified mutations were then manually reviewed to
ensure accuracy. After manual review, there were 919
mutations (917 SNVs and 2 Indels) left in BLCAb001 and
980 mutations (973 SNVs and 7 Indels) left in BLCAb002.
The mutation profiles were compared between the
primary and PDX to determine similarity. In both cases,
majority (91% in BLCAb001 and 82% in BLCAb002) of
all mutations were shared by primary and PDX samples
(Figure 1B). There also existed smaller numbers of
sample-specific mutations (2% primary-unique and 7%
PDX-unique in BLCAb001, 3% primary-unique and 15%
PDX-unique in BLCAb002), which may reflect the tumor
progression from primary to PDX tumors. In BLCAb001,
the VAFs of the shared mutations were centered near
primary = 0.25 and PDX = 0.5, which may indicate higher
tumor purity in PDX than the primary tumor. Similarly, in
BLCAb002, most shared mutations were around primary
= 0.25 and PDX = 0.5. Additionally, there was a small
group of mutations near primary = 0.4 and PDX = 1.0,

which were likely to be homozygous in the PDX (Figure
1B).
Among the identified somatic mutations, 13
alterations were previously found clinically relevant
according to ClinVar or mutated in other cancers as
summarized by COSMIC, including RS1 R209H, PIK3CA
E542K, MLL3 R199*, LRIG3 E576K, KLHL3 S410L,
FANCD2 L1134V, DNAH7 R1957* (BLCAb001); and
PIK3CA E545K, NCSTN S389C, MYD88 S219C, CREBBP
W1472C, CFTR R1066C, CDKN2A E69*(BLCAb002)
(Figure 1C). Most of these mutations were present in both
primary and PDXs except for CFTR R1066C, which was
only present in the PDX. For other novel nonsynonymous
mutations, 57 mutations occurred in Cancer Gene Census
genes or other genes known to be recurrently mutated in
bladder cancer genes [6, 36, 37], including 10 predicted
loss-of-function mutations (BLCAb001: MLL2 Q1361*,

ATP7A S1444* and CASP8 Q524*. All other mutations
were missense SNVs. In support of a genomic signature
associated with cisplatin resistance, RNA-Seq analysis
revealed overexpression of known cisplatin resistance
associated genes in BLCAb001, including NRG1, EGFR,
SLC7A11, TLE4, and IL1A (Figure S2) [39].

were present in both the primary and PDX. Only two
mutations, RANBP2 P1380R in BLCAb001, and RYR2
E1859K in BLCAb002, were present in the PDXs but not
in the primary tumor (Table S2).

Mutation signature in 3 groups: common,
primary unique, and PDX unique

Overexpression of xCT is associated with cisplatin
resistance

All SNVs in one patient were segregated by their
presence status in primary and PDX tumors into three
groups: “Common”, “Unique to primary” and “Unique
to PDX”. We analyzed mutation signature in every
group. In all three groups in BLCAb001 and two groups
(“Common” and “Unique to primary”) in BLCAb002, the
mutation signatures were dominated by C > T transitions
and C > G transversions. However, in BLCAb002
“Unique to PDX”, the two most prevalent patterns were C
> T transition and C > A transversions. Additionally, this
group also had elevated T > A transversions, which were
not observed in any other groups (Table S2).

Differential response to cisplatin treatment has
also been associated with overexpression of the cystine
transporter xCT (encoded product of SLC7A11) [10,
13]. Interestingly, BLCAb001 showed higher gene and
protein expression of xCT, as compared to BLCAb002
(Figure 3C). RNA-Seq analysis confirmed the
overexpression of SLC7A11 in BLCAb001 (Figure S2).
Further, immunohistochemical evaluation also showed
high expression of xCT in BLCAb001 (Figure 3D).
Additionally, we evaluated xCT expression in bladder
cancer tumors (n = 21) arranged in a tissue microarray
(TMA) by immunohistochemistry. High expression
of xCT (Figure 3E) was found in 67 % (14 out of 21)
of tumors, including PDX BLCAb001. TCGA data
analysis for xCT expression revealed the poorer survival
of bladder cancer patients is associated with altered
expression (Figure 3F). These results suggest that patients
with urothelial cancer showing high expression of xCT
may have shorter survival due to reduced response to
cisplatin-based regimens. Interestingly, a recent study
revealed the epigenetic alteration of microRNA-27A
leading to xCT overexpression in bladder cancer [13]. To
date, the effect of gene methylation on the expression of
xCT has not been investigated. In order to correlate xCT
expression and methylation, we determined the SLC7A11
(xCT) methylation status in bladder cancer patients (n =
52) and their matched non-tumor tissues (n = 106) and
found significant hypomethylation of SLC7A11 in tumors
compared to their matched non-tumor tissues (Figure 3G).
To evaluate the association between xCT
overexpression and cisplatin resistance, human bladder
cancer T24 cisplatin resistance cells were generated upon
in vitro long drug exposure. As shown in Figure S4A,
cisplatin resistant T24 cells presented a > 1-fold increase
in IC50 as compared to the parental cells. The decreased
sensitivity to cisplatin was associated with an increase in
xCT expression (Figure S4B). CD44 expression has been
reported to be involved in cisplatin resistance [40] and its
isoform CD44V6 has a potential role in stabilization of
xCT [41]. Thus, we investigated the expression of CD44
standard (CD44s) and its variants, CD44v6 and CD44v8,
in the T24 and UMUC3 models. By q-PCR we observed
that, while there was no difference in CD44s and CD44v8
gene expression between parental and cisplatin-resistant
cell lines, there was a CD44v6 overexpression in cisplatin

Basal and luminal phenotype in BLCAb001 and
BLCAb002, respectively
BLCAb001 and BLCAb002 were established from
cystectomy specimens and maintained the histological
features of the original tumors (Figure 2A). Thus, we
decided to better characterize the histological phenotypes.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that BLCAb001
expresses lower levels of the tissue differentiation
marker cytokeratin 20 (CK20) (Figure 2B), while had
higher expression of cytokeratin CK5/6, as compared to
BLCAb002. RNA-Seq analysis confirmed the upregulation
of basal phenotype associated genes in BLCAb001 (Figure
2C) and the upregulation of luminal phenotype associated
genes in BLCAb002 (Figure 2D).

Alteration of cisplatin resistance associated genes
in primary tumors and PDXs
BLCAb001 and BLCAb002 had similar mutation
burden, but exhibited a different response to increased
doses of cisplatin (Figure 3A). We confirmed this
differential response in primary tumor cells isolated
from these tumors. Cells isolated from BLCAb001 were
found to be less responsive to cisplatin treatment than
BLCAb002 cells [15]. To determine whether specific
genomic alterations were responsible for the observed
different cisplatin sensitivity between BLCAb001 and
BLCAb002, we compared the somatically genomic
alterations in known cisplatin resistance associated genes
[38]. Eight of such genes were found to be mutated (Figure
3B), six in BLCAb001 and two in BLCAb002. Two of
these mutations were predicted to cause loss-of-function:

resistant T24 and UMUC3 cells as compared to the
parental cells, confirming a possible role for xCT (Figure
S4C). Next, we tested whether the use of a putative xCT
inhibitor, sulfasalazine (SASP), was able to affect the
response to cisplatin. Combination of SASP enhanced
response to cisplatin in both cisplatin sensitive and
cisplatin resistant cells. (Figure S4E and S4F). In addition,
SASP effectively inhibited the colony formation of the
cisplatin resistant cells, suggesting a role for lysosome
function/biogenesis in the survival of xCT overexpressing
T24 cells (Figure S4F). In addition, we performed our
proliferation assay using the special RPMI media without
cysteine, methionine, and glutamate. Supplementation of
cysteine, but not methionine or glutamate, to the medium

rescued the normal growth of T24 cells (Figures S5A and
S5B). Taken together, these results suggest a potential role
for targeting the cystine transporter to modulate cisplatin
sensitivity in bladder cancer.

PI3KCA mutation status does not correlate with
response to a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor
The RNA-Seq analysis of BLCAb001 and
BLCAb002 revealed that both patients harbored a PIK3CA
hotspot mutation but on different residues: E542K and
E545K in BLCAb001 and BLCAb002, respectively
(Figure 4A). These mutations were present in the original

tumors and in the established PDXs, and were confirmed
in the derived cells lines (Table S2). Since PI3KCA helical
hotspot mutations (E542K and E545K) are common
(25%) in bladder cancers [42], we were interested to test
whether this mutational status was associated to response
to a targeted therapy. In vivo treatment with the dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor LY3023414 (LY414) demonstrated
a significant anti-tumor effect only in BLCAb002 and
not in BLCAb001 (Figure 4A and 4B). The inhibition of
tumor growth by LY414 was associated with inhibition
of phosphorylated AKT (ser473) and phosphorylated
S6 kinase (evaluated after 24h of drug treatment) in
BLCAb002 but not in BLCAb001 (Figure 4C). While
the initial tumor size is about 20% lower in BLCAb002
tumors compared to BLCAb001 tumors, the final size of
the tumor at the end of treatment is about 3 fold (150%)
lower in BLCAb002 tumors. We found there was no tumor
size difference with the treatment in BLCAb001 tumors.
We have repeated the experiment with same initial tumor

size of BLCAb001 and BLCAb002 tumors and found
significant tumor growth inhibition in BLACb002 tumors
but not in BLCAb001 tumors (Figure S10). These results
suggest that some additional molecular alterations or the
cross talk of cisplatin resistant genes may contribute to
the relative resistance of BLCAb001 to LY414 despite the
presence of an activating PI3KCA mutation. Indeed, our
RNAseq analysis revealed the overexpression of known
genes associated with resistance to AKT inhibition such
as phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase C2 domaincontaining gamma polypeptide (PIK3C2G), insulin
receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and serum- and glucocorticoidregulated kinase (SGK1) (Figure S6) [43-45].
Thus, we evaluated the cytotoxic effects of LY414
on cells isolated from the two PDXs. Similarly to the
in vivo results, BLCAb002 cells were found to be more
sensitive to LY414 as compared to BLCAb001 (Figure
4D). The IC50 for LY414 was 143.94 nM and 45.06
nM in BLCAb001 and BLCAb002 cells, respectively.

Interestingly, the target of LY414 p-AKT (ser473) was
inhibited in both cells at an early time point, but only in
BLCAb002 at 24 and 48 hrs (Figure 4E). Same results
were observed for thr308 phosphorylation site (Figure
S8A). We observed p-S6 inhibition in both the tumor cell
models, also at later time points. When we tested selected
agent for either mTOR (RAD001) or AKT (MK2206)
inhibition, we observed target inhibition in both
BLCAb001 and BLCAb002 (Figure S8B). The inhibition
was maintained also at 24 and 48 hrs (Figure S8C). In
order to confirm that BLCAB001 tumors in general are
less sensitive to the drugs targeting P13K/mTOR inhibitors
compared to BLCAb002 tumors, we have determined the
p-AKT, downstream makers after treating the cells with
BEZ235 (250 nM) and BKM120 (500nM). As the results
shown with LY414 treatment, we found pronounced

inhibition of p-AKT in BLCAb002 cells which are
more sensitive to P13K/mTOR inhibitors compared to
BLCAb001 cells (Figure 9SA, 9SB). Interestingly, when
we combined LY414 with bromodomain inhibitor JQ,
we observed inhibition of p-AKT in BLCAb001 cells,
which was not observed with LY414 alone (Figure 9S C).
Additional studies are warranted to investigate how JQ
combination optimized the P13K/mTOR dual inhibitor
LY414.
Interestingly, the differential cytotoxicity effect
of LY414 between the two models was not observed
when the cells were tested in insulin enriched RPMI F
media (Figure S7A). The IC50 was 212.9 nM and 208
nM for BLCA001 and BLCAb002, respectively (Figure
S7B). These results suggest that enriched media with
insulin may compensate the AKT pathway inhibition.

E542 mutation is associated with weaker binding
of LY414 to PI3K

Finally, we examined whether modulation of autophagy
could be responsible for the observed differential
response to LY414 between the two models. Thus, in
our RNA-Seq analysis we observed overexpression of
BNIP3 and BCL11A, and downregulation of BCL2L14,
ULK2, RAB11FIP4 and BAG1 in BLCAb001 tumors
as compared to BLCAb002 (Figure 5A). Western blot
analysis confirmed the persistence of autophagy protein
expression in BLCAb001 cells treated with LY414, but
downregulation of Beclin-1 and LC3B I/II in BLCAb002
cells, associated with cleaved PARP.

Based on the different biological effect elicited by
LY414, we investigated whether the mutation type could
contribute by affecting the affinity of the compound to the
substrate. Protein-ligand binding orientation was analyzed
with the Sybyl-X 2.0 program. After docking, the best
binding conformation of the compound with the protein
was selected based on C score values. C score is the
scoring system used to rank the binding affinity of ligands

Figure 6: Effect of E542K and E545K mutations on LY414 binding to PI3K. A. Docking results for BLCAb001 and BLCAb002

with LY414 (Kcal/mol). The Crash score reveals inappropriate penetration into the binding site. The Polar score identifies the Region of
the ligand. The D score defines the charge and van der waals interactions between the protein and ligand. The PMF score defines the
Helmholtz free energies for protein-ligand atom pairs interactions. The Gscore identifies the Hydrogen bonding, ligand-protein and internal
ligand-ligand energies. The Chem score identifies the points for hydrogen bonding, lipophilic contact and rotational entropy, along with

of ligands. A higher C-score value denotes a greater binding affinity. The increased negative values of Crash score, Chem score, D-score,
G-score and Potential Mean Force scores (PMF) indicate the high binding energy between the protein-ligand complexes. The low values
indicate the least binding affinity of the compound towards the target. The binding energies are expressed in Kcal/mol unit. B. Binding

and is based on different scoring functions, including crash
score, polar score, D score, PMF score, G score and Chem
score, ranging between 0 (low ) to 5 (high). The binding
parameters for BLCAb001 and LY-3023414 are presented
in Figure 6A. The BLCAb001 and LY-3023414 binding
had a C-score value of 2.21. The LY-3023414 interacts
with residues Ser 312 and Cys 838 as depicted in Figure
6B. BLCAb002 and LY-3023414 complex has a C-score
value of 4.23 and it interacts with Glu 237 and Lys 678
residues of BLCAb002 (Figure 6B). The binding of LY414 to the wild type protein had a C score of 2.51 which
is similar as BLCAb001 (data not shown). These results
suggest that the E545K mutation observed in BLCAb002
may induce conformational changes in the PI3K protein
that could lead to greater binding of LY414 and a stronger
inhibitory effect. Lysine is a very dynamic amino acid
in the proteins, being oxidized by lysyl oxidase (LOX)
an enzyme whose functional significance on tumor
progression and metastasis is known [46, 47]. Further,
oxidation of specific position lysine molecule opens
the protein-protein interactions that influence the tissue
remodeling and drug response. Since the E545 mutation
we found in BLCAb002 has a lysine at 545 position that
may be involved in formation of drug binding pocket
and more LY414 drug may bind to PI3K and inhibit the
protein.

original tumor and the derived PDXs as reported also in
other tumor types, and support the clinical relevance of
utilizing bladder cancer PDXs for drug development.
Cisplatin resistance is one of the major challenges
for the management of bladder cancer. The resistance
mechanisms may be intrinsic or acquired [5, 49]. Several
mechanisms have been proposed, including reduction of
intracellular drug accumulation by either reduced uptake
[38] or increased efflux by transmembrane pumps, such
as the multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1)/p-glycoprotein and
ATP binding cassette (ABC) protein [49]. Furthermore,
overexpression of MDR1 has been shown to enhance
DNA damage repair and to reduce induction of apoptosis
[50]. In addition, solute carrier importers CTR1, the SLCs,
AQP2, AQP9 and endocytic recycling compartment
have been reported as cisplatin resistance regulators
[51]. Upregulation of novel genes, including LUM,
DCN, PDE3B, PDGF-C, NRG1, PKD2, IL1A have been
shown to be overexpressed in cisplatin resistant cell lines
[39]. In our cisplatin resistant PDX model, BLCAb001,
we observed genomic alterations of several cisplatin
resistance associated genes, such as Casp8, SLC7A11,
TLE4, and IL1A. We have also observed overexpression
of the membrane bound cystine/glutamate exchanger xCT,
a lysosome regulatory protein and its stabilizer CD44v6
in cisplatin resistant PDX and cells. Recent studies have
reported the association of the cystine transporter xCT
with cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer [13], and its
potential prognostic role in hepatocellular carcinoma
[52]. Drug repurposing of sulfasalazine, a xCT inhibitor,
is currently in clinical testing [53]. Taken together, our
findings suggest a role for xCT in the resistant phenotype
and provide not only an additional potential predictive
marker to be incorporated in a composite molecular
signature for cisplatin resistance, but also a rational target
for therapeutic interventions in patients with bladder
cancer.
Genomic profiling of our PDX models showed two
canonical PIK3CA mutations, which activate the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. BLCAb001 possesses
a PIK3CA activating mutation (E542K), which is less
common than E545K present in BLCAb002 [54, 55]).
Thus, we expected both tumors to respond to a targeted
PI3K inhibitor [56, 57]). To our surprise, LY414 treatment
did not significantly inhibit either the in vitro or in vivo
growth of BLCAb001, and did not induce sustained
target modulation, as compared to the BLCAb002 model.
Several potential mechanisms may be responsible for this
differential response. Our RNA-Seq data analysis revealed
overexpression of several genes, including SGK1, IRS1,
and PIK3C2G in BLCAb001 (Figure S6), which are
known resistance markers for P13K/AKT targeted agents
[43-45]. Interestingly, when we cultured BLCAb001
cells in enriched RPMI F medium with growth factors
and insulin we were able, in part, to restore sensitivity to
LY414 (Figure S7). Thus, we speculate that the in vitro

DISCUSSION
Precision medicine aimed to develop more tailored
and effective cancer treatments is currently based on
genomic profiling of either tumor tissues or liquid
biopsies. The clinical challenge is whether the molecular
findings are predictive of response to targeted therapies in
cancer patients. Our preclinical observations suggest that,
at least in bladder cancer, a composite genetic signature
may be more predictive of response to cisplatin than a
specific mutational status to a PI3K inhibitor.
Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), along with
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), are
becoming an important tool for drug development in
several tumor types, including urothelial carcinoma [48].
In our exosome sequencing study, the PDXs maintained
the same genetic make-up as the original tumors.
In each case, 80-90% of all somatic mutations were
present in both the primary and PDX tumors. There was
only a small fraction (7% and 15% in BLCAb001 and
BLCAb002, respectively) of PDX-specific mutations,
and even a smaller number (2% and 3% in BLCAb001
and BLCAb002, respectively) of mutations present only
in the primary tumor. These small differences may reflect
either the addition or loss of mutations during tumor
progression from primary to PDXs. Alternatively, some
of these genetic differences may be explained by tumor
heterogeneity. Overall, our results in bladder cancer
models confirm the genomic similarity between the

identification of PIK3CA mutations through genomic
profiling may not necessarily predict response to PI3K
targeted therapies in mouse models and, likewise, in
patients with urothelial carcinoma. Several “by-pass”
mechanisms may influence treatment response. In our
PDX models, we observed that a composite genetic and
molecular signature may be more likely associated with
cisplatin sensitivity/response. Additional molecular
studies are warranted to identify specific gene mutations/
alterations responsible for the differential response to
treatment in these PDX models. The development and
validation of genomic signatures will help the clinical
implementation of effective targeted therapies for bladder
cancer.

presence of insulin may artificially hyper-activate PI3K
signaling in BLCAb001 cells that is responsible for
increased glycolysis and aldolase mobilization leading
to increased vulnerability [58]. As shown in the in vitro
experiments, we observed LY414 induced inhibition of
p-AKT, both at the ser473 and the thr308 phosphorylation
sites, in BLCAb001 only at early time of exposure (30-90
minutes), but not at 24 and 48 hrs. If we used a selected
AKT inhibitor we did not observed this difference. Thus,
we hypothesize that in BLCAb001, but not in BLCAb002,
inhibition of PI3K may induce a feed-back upregulation
of receptor tyrosine kinases and, consequently, reinduction of pAKT and sustained autophagy, as reported
in other tumor systems [59]. Recent studies have shown
activation of autophagy as one of the critical molecular
alterations that limits the anti-tumor effects of PI3K/
mTOR inhibitors [60]. Our RNAseq data showed BNIP3
and BCL11A upregulation, and ULK2, BAG1, RAB11FIP4
and BCLL14 downregulation in BLCAb001 tumors,
mirroring the higher levels of LC3B I/II by Western blot
analysis (Figure 5A and 5B). Interestingly, the treatment
of sulfasalazine, an inducer of autophagic cell death,
enhanced the efficacy of cisplatin resistant BLCAb001
cells. Taken together, these observations suggest that
the autophagy may contribute to the observed resistance
LY414 in BLCAb001 cells.
The presence of two similar but distinct hot-spot
mutations in BLCAb001 and BLCAb002 lead us to
explore the possibility that the differential mutational
status could have an impact on the affinity for LY414.
Interestingly, the docking results suggest that there might
be a significant difference in the binding of the compound
with the two mutants. Simulation of BLCAb002 and
LY414 interaction suggest a higher binding affinity than
the BLCAb001 and LY414 complex, as indicated by the
differences in C scores. Thus, when we compared the
binding affinity of LY414 with the mutants (BLCAb001
and BLCAb002) and the wild type, the best binding
affinity for the compound was observed for BLCAb002.
This observation may provide an additional mechanism
responsible for the differential effect of LY414 in the two
bladder cancer PDXs and raises the question whether
different mutations may have different drug binding
affinities and, consequently, different drug sensitivity. We
can speculate that the difference in binding affinity due to
conformational changes may be also in part responsible
for the lack of sustained in vitro target modulation by
LY414 observed in BLCAb001. To our knowledge, there
are no prior reports showing potential differential effects
of E542K and E545K mutations on PI3K drug binding.
These findings might provide a rationale for focusing the
development of LY414 specifically for bladder cancer
patients with a E545K mutation. Additional experimental
validation studies are required to confirm these findings.
In conclusion, our results suggest that the

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The RPCI Institutional Review Board gave approval
for this study. Patients consented to remnant tissue
procurement for next generation sequencing of their
samples. Sequencing was performed according to a RPCI
IRB approved investigator initiated protocol.

Whole exome sequencing (WES)
Individual exome capture of each DNA sample was
carried out using the SureSelectXT Reagent kit as per
manufacturer’s recommendation (Agilent Technologies,
Inc.). 3 µg of genomic DNA was fragmented to a size
range of 150-200 bp followed by end repair, adaptor
ligation, and low cycle (5) PCR. Libraries were purified
and validated for appropriate size (225-275 bp) on a
2100 Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA chip (Agilent
Technologies, Inc.). 750 ng of purified library was then
hybridized to the SureSelectXT Human All Exon 50
Mb library for 18 hours at 65°C. The captured regions
were then bound to Streptavidin T1 magnetic beads
(Life Technologies, Inc.) and washed to remove any
non-specific bound products. Eluted library underwent
a second 11 cycle PCR amplification using Herculase II
Fusion Polymerase (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) to add
sample specific barcodes necessary for multiplexing. Final
libraries were purified, validated for size by a BioAnalyzer
(250-350 bp), and quantitated using KAPA qPCR.
Individual libraries were pooled (3-plex) in equimolar 2
nM final concentration. Each pool was normalized to 10
pM, loaded and clustered to individual lanes of a HiSeq
Flow Cell using an Illumina cBot (TruSeq PE Cluster Kit
v3), followed by 2 x 101 PE sequencing on a HiSeq2000
sequencer according to the manufacturer’s recommended
protocol (Illumina Inc.).

Detection of somatic sequence mutations in
primary tumor

and variant allele fraction (VAF).

Sanger validation

High quality paired-end reads passing Illumina
RTA filter were aligned to the NCBI human reference
genome (GRCh37) using BWA [16]. PCR duplicated
reads were marked using Picard [17]. Putative SNVs
and Indels were identified by running variation detection
module of Bambino [18]. All putative SNVs were further
filtered based on a standard set of criteria to remove the
following common types of false calls: (1) the alternative
allele was present in the matching normal sample and
the contingency between the tumor and normal samples
was not statistically significant; (2) the mutant alleles
were only present in one stand and the strand bias was
statistically significant; (3) the putative mutation occurred
at a site with systematically reduced base quality scores;
(4) the reads harboring the mutant allele were associated
with poor mapping quality. Ambiguous calls were
manually inspected to ensure accuracy. Putative indels
were evaluated by a re-alignment process to filter out
potential false calls introduced by unapparent germline
events, mapping artifacts and homopolymer. All mutations
were annotated using ANNOVAR [19] with NCBI RefSeq
database.

PCR amplicons targeting the PIK3CA and CASP8
regions were generated with gene specific primers (Table
S3 and S4) using a touchdown PCR protocol with the
following parameters: 94°C for 15 min, followed by 45
cycles of 94°C for 20 seconds, 68°C initial annealing
for 30 seconds (followed by 1°C reduction of temperate
per cycle to a final annealing temperature of 58°C for
remaining 35 cycles), and 72°C for 1 min. Amplicons
were purified using the QIAquick® PCR Purification
Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) as per manufacturer
instructions. Ten microliter aliquots for each sample were
run on a 2% agarose gel for 1 hour at 100V to confirm
the correct amplified length (~250 bp). The products were
tagged using Big Dye Terminator v3.1 Master Mix Kit
(Life Technologies™, Carlsbad, CA) as per manufacturer
instructions, and purified over hydrated Sephadex-G50
from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich®, St. Louis, MO),
in Multiscreen HV Plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Waltham, MA). The eluted samples were placed on a
3130xl ABI Prism Genetic Analyzer and run on the default
settings for 50 cm Array using POP-7 Polymer. The data
was analyzed with Sequencing Analysis 5.2 software (Life
Technologies™, Carlsbad, CA).

Detection of somatic sequence mutations in
xenograft tumors

RNA-Seq analysis

To filter out reads caused by mouse stromal
contamination in PDX, all reads from the PDXs were run
through an in silico approach to determine the species
of origin. More specifically, we first created a combined
reference sequence containing the sequences of all
chromosomes in the NCBI genome assemblies of human
(GRCh37) and mouse (GRCm38), and then aligned reads
from PDX to the combined reference sequence using
BWA. Only reads classified of human but not mouse origin
were kept in downstream analyses. Afterwards, standard
somatic mutation calling was performed on PDX with
the matched normal as described previously. For testing
purpose, we also performed somatic mutation calling on
the uncleaned PDX data to evaluate the effect of mouse
contamination on the somatic mutation calling.

Raw reads that passed quality filter from Illumina
RTA were first pre-processed by using 1) FASTQC for
sequencing base quality control and 2) cutadapt to remove
adapter sequences if applicable. Those reads were then
mapped to the latest mouse reference genome (mm10)
and ENSEMBLE annotation database using Tophat [20]
or STAR [21]. A second round of QC using RSeQC [22]
was applied to mapped bam files to identify potential
RNA-Seq library preparation problems. From the mapping
results, reads that matched a single unique location in the
genome were kept, allowing up to two mismatches for
further analysis. The number of reads aligning to each
gene were calculated using HTSeq [23]. Differentially
expressed genes were identified using DESeq2 [24],
a variance-analysis package developed to infer the
statically significant difference in RNASeq data. A
biological hypothesis was also tested using a generalized
linear model implemented in DESeq2 by construct
corresponding contrasts. Multiple testing corrections were
applied. The list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
were analyzed for enriched Gene Ontology and/or KEGG
pathway term with the GAGE [25] Bioconductor package.
GSAASeqSP [26]was also applied for pathway analysis
that utilizes p-values from all genes instead of only DEGs.

Comparing mutations in xenograft and primary
tumors
All unique somatic mutations identified from the
primary tumor or PDX were re-visited in both the primary
tumor and matched PDX BAM files. The number of
mutant and non-mutant reads at the site of each mutation
in all BAM files were extracted using Mutation Reads
Extractor (manuscript in submission) to calculate coverage

colonies were counted.

Western blot analysis

The experimental structures for mutants BLCAb001
and BLCAb002 Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) were
not available and hence the mutant structures were
modelled using the MODELLER 9.16 [27] using the the
crystal structure of Pi3K alpha lipid kinase (PDB ID:
4YKN as template [28]. The constructed models were
validated through PROCHECK [29]and ProSA [30]
servers. The ligand structure (LY-3023414) was retrieved
from the TOXNET’s Chem-IDplus database [31]. Sybyl-X
2.0 (Tripos international, USA) [32] was used for the
present study.

Protein extracts were isolated from tumor tissue
using a polytron homogenizer and cells were extracted
by sonication in lysis buffer. Forty micrograms of protein
were separated by gel electrophoresis followed by transfer
on to a PVDF membrane. Western blot analysis was
performed using the primary antibodies for xCT (1:500
dilution, Abcam), mTOR (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling),
p-mTOR (1:1000 dilution, Cell Signaling); Akt (1:1000
dilution, Cell Signaling) p-Akt (1:1000 dilution, Cell
Signaling), p-PRAS40 (1:1000 dilution) p-S6 (1:1000
dilution, Cell Signaling), β-actin or GAPDH were used as
loading controls.

Cell cuture and cisplatin resistant cells

Quantitative RT-PCR

BLCAb001 and BLCAb002 cells were isolated from
primary tumors of urothelial cell carcinoma of bladder and
were originally authenticated by chromosome karyotyping
[15]. Cells were cultured using enriched F-medium
supplemented with ROCK inhibitor and insulin growth
factor as described previously [33]. These cells were
recently ( < 6 months) confirmed to be of human origin
with the detection of the human specific Alu gene by RTPCR. Human bladder cancer cells lines, T24 and UMUC3,
were purchased from ATCC. No authentication was done.
The cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10%
FBS. Cisplatin resistant ( > 10 fold) cells, T24-Cis and
UMUC3-Cis, were generated by continuous treatment of
cisplatin (gradual increase) for approximately 5-months.

Gene expression at the mRNA level was determined
by performing quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) as
described earlier [34]. Briefly, RNA was isolated from
tumor tissue and cells using Trizol reagent and prepared
cDNA using the high efficiency cDNA synthesis kit (Life
Technologies). Gene specific primers were utilized to
determine expression levels of genes with SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies) with CFX96 Touch
Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad). β-actin was
used as an internal control. Normalized fold expression of
genes was determined using the CFX Manager Software.

Patient derived tumor xenografts, drug treatment,
and tumor growth

Tumor cell growth inhibition
Tumor cell growth inhibitory effect of cisplatin,
sulfasalazine alone and in combination, was evaluated by
SRB assay [34]. Effect of PI3K/mTOR/AKT inhibitors,
LY414, RAD001, and MK2206, was determined by
MTT cell proliferation assay kit as described by the
manufacturer (ThermoFisher Scientific). LY414 was
kindly provided by Eli Lilly and Company. The other
compounds were purchased (Selleckchem, Houston TX).

Two patient derived tumor xenografts (PDXs),
BLCAb001 and BLCAb002, were generated using fresh
primary tumors from bladder cancer patients as described
by us earlier [15]. For evaluation of drug efficacy, small
pieces of PDXs were surgically transplanted into SCID
mice subcutaneously and allowed to establish. When
the tumors reached approximately 100-200 mm3, mice
were randomized into groups of 5-8 mice and treated
with vehicle, LY414 (5 mg/kg BID by oral gavage), or
cisplatin 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg weekly by intraperitoneal
injection). Tumor sizes were blindly measured weekly
along with the body weight of mice. At the end of the
treatment, tumors were collected, weighed, and processed
for formalin fixation and small pieces were frozen for
protein extraction.

Colony formation assay
Bladder cancer cells (3 x 102) of parental and
cisplatin resistant T24 and UMUC3 cell lines were
seeded in plates and allowed to grow overnight. Cells
were treated with cisplatin, xCT inhibitor sulfasalazine
alone and in combination with cisplatin for 24 to 48 h.
Medium was removed and the cells were rinsed with PBS,
fresh medium was added, and cells were allowed to grow
for 3 to 4 weeks. Cells were then fixed and stained with
methylene blue, photomicrographs were captured, and

bladder cancer tumors arranged in tissue microarray
(TMA). Standard immunohistochemical protocols were
followed as previously described by us earlier [15, 35].
Briefly, formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumors were
used to prepare sections (5 µm), deparaffinized followed
by rehydration and antigen unmasking in sodium citrate
buffer (pH 6.0). Primary antibodies xCT (1:400 dilution),
AKT, p-AKT, mTOR, p-mTOR, and cytokeratin 5/6/20,
were used for overnight incubation at 4oC, followed
by their respective horseradish-conjugated secondary
antibody for 1hr. Photomicrographs were captured using a
Zeiss Axio (Peabody, MA) microscope.
