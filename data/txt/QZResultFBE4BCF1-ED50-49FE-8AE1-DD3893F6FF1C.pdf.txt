BACKGROUND: Patients with Ewing sarcoma require local primary tumor control with surgery, radiation, or both. The optimal choice
of local control for overall and local disease control remains unclear. METHODS: Patients with localized Ewing sarcoma of bone who
were treated on 3 consecutive protocols with standard-dose, 5-drug chemotherapy every 3 weeks were included (n5465). Propensity
scores were used to control for differences between local control groups by constructing multivariate models to assess the impact of
local control type on clinical endpoints (event-free survival [EFS], overall survival, local failure, and distant failure) independent of differences in their propensity to receive each local control type. RESULTS: Patients who underwent surgery were younger (P5.02) and
had more appendicular tumors (P<.001). Compared with surgery, radiation had higher unadjusted risks of any event (hazard ratio
[HR], 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-2.44), death (HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.18-2.85), and local failure (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.37-4.83). On
multivariate analysis, compared with surgery, radiation had a higher risk of local failure (HR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.24-4.68), although there
were no significant differences in EFS (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.94-2.14), overall survival (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.83-2.26), or distant failure (HR,
1.13; 95% CI, 0.70-1.84) between local control groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this large group of similarly treated patients, choice of the
mode of local control was not related significantly to EFS, overall survival, or distant failure, although the risk of local failure was
greater for radiation compared with surgery. These data support surgical resection when appropriate, whereas radiotherapy remains

INTRODUCTION
Patients with Ewing sarcoma require a multimodal treatment approach, including chemotherapy and local control of the
primary tumor. Ewing sarcoma is radiosensitive and, historically, local control typically involved definitive radiation therapy alone.1 Several factors have increased the use of surgical local control for these tumors, including increased awareness
of the late effects of radiotherapy and advances in imaging and limb-sparing surgery.2 Current local control options consist
of radiation alone, surgery alone, or a combination of surgery with radiation.

Original Article

The optimal mode of local control in Ewing sarcoma remains unclear. No prospective studies have compared surgery with radiotherapy in a randomized trial,
and numerous barriers to such a trial exist. Instead, clinical trials in Ewing sarcoma have made recommendations
regarding local control strategies, but the choice is individualized and depends on factors such as tumor location, tumor size, age, patient preference, and institutional
practice. Many of these factors also influence prognosis.
Consequently, analyses comparing local control strategies
without adjustment for other prognostic factors have generally indicated that patients who receive definitive radiotherapy have lower rates of both local control and overall
survival than patients who undergo definitive surgery.
We used a large cohort of patients who received a
similar chemotherapy regimen on 3 consecutive clinical
trials to evaluate the optimal mode of local control for
patients with localized osseous Ewing sarcoma. We controlled for known confounding factors that influence the
choice of local control and prognosis using both a propensity score method3 and conventional multivariate
methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

The cohort included eligible patients who were treated on
the experimental arm of study INT-00914 and on the
standard arms of studies INT-01545 and AEWS0031.6
Patients were aged <30 years (<50 years for AEWS0031)
before enrollment and had not received prior therapy.
Only patients with nonmetastatic Ewing sarcoma or
primitive neuroectodermal tumor of bone were eligible
for this analysis. Patients with tumors arising in the head
were excluded because of multiple deviations from local
control guidelines in this unusual site. Only patients who
had complete local control data and who had received
local control after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were
included. In addition, we included only patients who had
started local control 2 months and 6 months from
randomization.
Patients were treated primarily at Children’s Oncology Group centers located in the United States and Canada. Each center’s institutional review board approved the
treatment protocols. Written informed consent was
obtained for all patients at enrollment.

A detailed summary of chemotherapy and local control is

information) and in the primary articles derived from the
INT-0091, INT-0154, and AEWS0031 studies.4-6
Statistical Methods

Tumors were classified by site using the following categories: spine, chest wall (rib, clavicle, sternum, and scapula),
pelvis (pelvis and sacrum), proximal extremity (humerus
and femur), and distal extremity (radius, ulna, tibia, fibula, and bones of the hands and feet). Tumors were classified as small (<8 cm in greatest dimension) or large (8
cm in greatest dimension) according to initial imaging.
Tumor size data were not collected on AEWS0031.
We compared categorical patient characteristics
between local control groups using chi-square tests. Continuous variables were compared between local control
groups using analyses of variance.
We used logistic regression to generate propensity
scores, which indicated the probability that each patient
treated on 1 of the included trials would have been
selected to receive each of 3 modes of local control: radiation, surgery, or surgery plus radiation. The logistic
regression model included covariates thought to influence
individual physician and patient choice of local control;
however, it is noteworthy that the model did not include
as potential predictive covariates the actual mode of local
control received or any of the clinical outcomes of interest
described below. The potential covariates assessed were
age, sex, tumor site, tumor size, clinical trial, and year of
study entry. By comparing clinical outcomes among
patients who had a similar likelihood (or propensity) of
receiving the same mode of local control who nevertheless
were selected for different modes of local control, we were
able to take advantage of variations in clinical practice to
control for confounding by comparing similar groups of
patients. For a comprehensive description of this
approach, see the review article by Rubin.3
The primary outcome was event-free survival (EFS),
with events defined as disease progression, death from any
cause, or second malignant neoplasm. Secondary outcomes included overall survival, local failure, and distant
failure. All survival outcomes were determined from the
start of the first local control intervention that occurred after initial neoadjuvant chemotherapy. EFS and overall
survival were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods, and
patients without events were censored at the time of last
follow-up.7 We determined the cumulative incidence of
local failure using a competing-risks approach in which
patients who experienced distant failure, death, or a second malignant neoplasm before local failure were censored at the time of that event. We used an analogous

approach to determine the cumulative incidence of distant
failure.
We constructed Cox proportional-hazards models
to evaluate differences in EFS and overall survival according to the mode of local control. We used competing-risk
regression analysis to evaluate differences in local failure
and distant failure according to the mode of local control.8 Definitive surgery was chosen as the reference
group. Analyses performed with definitive radiation as the
reference group yielded similar results. The proportionalhazards assumption was tested using time-dependent
covariates and was satisfied in all models.
Unadjusted models included mode of local control
as the sole covariate. The primary adjusted models also
included surgical and radiation propensity scores with
and without age and tumor site as additional covariates.
We performed sensitivity analyses that separately controlled for clinical trial and tumor size for the subset of
patients who had size data available. We also constructed
conventional Cox and competing-risk regression models
that did not rely on propensity score methods but, rather,
used each variable as a covariate. All statistical analyses
were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, NC) and STATA version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, Tex).
RESULTS
Patient Selection

Nine hundred seventy-nine of 1444 patients with localized Ewing sarcoma who were randomized as part of studies INT-0091, INT-0154, and AEWS0031, were
excluded (Fig. 1). The most common reasons for exclusion were randomization to other chemotherapy regimens
(n5477) and soft tissue Ewing sarcoma (n5218). Data
from the remaining 465 patients were used to compare
characteristics between local control groups and to generate propensity scores.
Patient Characteristics Differ
by Local Control Group

Patient characteristics differed according to the mode of
local control (Table 1). Patients who received definitive
radiation were more likely to have pelvic tumors, whereas
patients who underwent surgery were more likely to have
extremity tumors. Patients who underwent surgery were
more likely to be younger compared with patients who
received definitive radiation or underwent surgery plus
radiation. Tumor size <8 cm versus 8 cm was not associated with choice of local control (P5.24). Lower rates of
definitive radiotherapy were observed in more recent years

(P<.001). Of the 103 patients who underwent surgery
plus radiation, 17 (16.5%) received preoperative radiotherapy, and 86 (83.5%) received postoperative
radiotherapy.
Local Control Propensity Scores

We constructed a series of logistic regression models of
choice of local control based on the potential covariates
detailed above (see Statistical Methods). Age, tumor site,
clinical trial, and year of study entry were significant predictors of the mode of local control on univariate and
multivariate analysis. Because clinical trial and year of
study entry were correlated, we excluded clinical trial
from the final model, and only age, tumor site, and year
of study entry were used. Models that were generated with
and without tumor size data from patients who had complete information on tumor size yielded nearly identical
propensity scores (Supporting Fig. 1; see online supporting information). Tumor size was not included in the final
model, because data were unavailable for patients who
were treated on AEWS0031 and for some patients from
the other trials.
Both surgical and radiation propensity scores were
well distributed between local control groups (Fig. 2).
This distribution indicates variation in clinical practice in
the choice of local control for similar patients. For example, as illustrated in Figure 2A, there was a group of
patients who, based on characteristics of the entire cohort,
had a predicted <20% likelihood (or propensity) of being
selected for definitive radiation who nevertheless were
selected for definitive radiation by their treating

physicians. Likewise, as illustrated in Figure 2B, there
were patients who had a predicted high propensity for
undergoing definitive surgery who nevertheless received
definitive radiation. This overlap in propensity scores
between groups is critical for this type of analysis, because
it allows a comparison of outcomes for similar patients
who received different treatment approaches. However, 7
of 9 patients who had radiation propensity scores >0.8
were nearly uniformly selected for radiation therapy.
These 9 patients were excluded from future analyses. Reevaluating patient characteristics according to quintiles of
surgical propensity score demonstrated improved balance
between local control groups (Supporting Table 1; see
online supporting information).
Impact of Mode of Local Control on EFS

One hundred fifty-eight analytic events were observed in
the cohort (70 with definitive surgery, 49 with definitive
radiation, and 39 with surgery plus radiation). Patients
who received definitive radiation, compared with those
who underwent definitive surgery, had a higher unadjusted risk of any event (hazard ratio [HR], 1.70; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.18-2.44; P5.004) (Table 2;
see Supporting Table 2 for unadjusted survival rates
470

according to the mode of local control; see online supporting information). The unadjusted risk of any event
did not differ significantly between patients who underwent surgery plus radiation and those who underwent surgery alone. After adjusting for surgical and radiation
propensity scores, the risk of any event did not differ significantly between patients who received definitive radiation and those who underwent surgery plus radiation
compared with those who underwent surgery alone (definitive radiation: HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.94-2.14; P5.10;
surgery plus radiation: HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.77-1.75;
P5.47).
Although patient age and tumor site were used to
generate surgical and radiation propensity scores, it is possible that differences in these characteristics between local
control groups could lead to residual confounding. Therefore, we constructed additional models that controlled for
these variables in addition to propensity scores and
yielded similar results. Separate models that also controlled for either clinical trial or greatest tumor dimension
among the 212 patients who had tumor size data available
yielded similar conclusions.
To further evaluate the robustness of these findings,
we constructed 2 additional models that did not rely on

propensity scores (Table 2). The first model used the variables that were used to construct the propensity scores
(age, tumor site, and year of diagnosis) as covariates. The
second model used these same covariates and the greatest
tumor dimension. The results were similar to the findings
obtained using propensity score methods.
Impact of Mode of Local Control on Secondary
Clinical Endpoints

We applied these same methods to evaluate the risk of
death according to the mode of local control (Table 3).
Patients who either received definitive radiation or underwent surgery plus radiation, compared with those who
underwent surgery alone, had a higher unadjusted risk of
death (definitive radiation: HR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.18-2.85;
P5.006; surgery plus radiation: HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.102.76; P5.02). After adjusting for surgical and radiation
Cancer

propensity scores, the risk of death was not statistically significantly different for patients who either received definitive radiation or underwent surgery plus radiation
compared with those who underwent surgery alone. Similar results were obtained from the additional models in
Table 3.
Next, we evaluated the incidence of distant failure
and local failure in this cohort. Distant failure as a component of a first event (isolated distant failure or combined
distant and local failure) accounted for 106 of 131 disease
failures. Local failure as a component of a first event
accounted for 49 of 131 disease failures. There were only
25 isolated local failures as a first episode of disease failure.
Although the unadjusted cumulative incidence of distant
failure appeared to be relatively similar between local control groups (Fig. 3A), the unadjusted cumulative incidence of local failure was higher among patients who
received definitive radiation compared with the other 2
local control groups (Fig. 3B).
These findings were recapitulated in competing-risk
regression analyses (Table 3). On univariate analysis, the
risk of distant failure did not differ significantly between
patients who received definitive radiation and those who
underwent surgery plus radiation compared with those
who underwent surgery alone. Similar results were
obtained in multivariate models of distant failure using either propensity score methods or conventional methods
that incorporated raw covariates into the models.
In contrast, the risk of local failure was significantly
higher among patients who received definitive radiation
compared with those who underwent surgery (Table 3).
On univariate analysis, the HR for local failure was 2.57
(95% CI, 1.37-4.83; P5.003) for patients who received
radiation compared with those who underwent surgery.
After controlling for propensity scores, this difference
remained significant (HR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.24-4.68;
P5.01). Secondary models that added additional covariates or relied solely on the raw covariates to control for
confounding confirmed this difference.
DISCUSSION
In this large cohort of patients who received similar chemotherapy, patient and tumor characteristics differed
according to the chosen mode of local control. We
observed significant heterogeneity in clinical decision
making around local control. We noted a broad overlap in
surgical propensity scores among patients who received either definitive surgery or definitive radiation. We were
able to exploit this heterogeneity to compare outcomes
among patients with similar propensity to receive a

specific local control modality. Overall disease control
and overall survival did not differ according to the mode
of local control. Definitive radiation was associated with a
higher risk of local failure. The somewhat paradoxical
finding of higher risk of local failure for patients who
received definitive radiotherapy but similar EFS and overall survival reflects the relatively low contribution of local
failure to overall disease failure in Ewing sarcoma. Nevertheless, when planning for a specific patient’s local therapy, our findings, as well as the risk of radiation-induced
second malignancy, support the current practice of surgical resection when appropriate while validating radiotherapy as a reasonable alternative in selected patients,
depending on individual factors.
Patients who underwent surgery plus received radiation had outcomes similar to patients who underwent surgery alone. This group was heterogeneous, comprising
patients who received postoperative radiotherapy for positive margins, postoperative radiotherapy for gross residual
disease after debulking surgery, or preoperative radiotherapy according to institutional practice. The similar outcomes in this group, compared with the group that
underwent definitive surgery alone, may reflect the contribution of patients in that group who received preoperative
radiotherapy but may have been able to achieve complete
472

resection without it. Moreover, this group was the smallest of the 3 local control cohorts studied. Because of the
size and heterogeneity of this group, it is difficult to draw
firm conclusions about the role of combined surgery plus
radiation. Current North American standard practice discourages “debulking” surgeries in which gross residual tumor is anticipated. Instead, combined surgery plus
radiotherapy is currently reserved for patients who unexpectedly have positive margins. Our results suggest that
disease control is acceptable with this approach.
Several other large analyses have compared surgery
with radiation as local control for Ewing sarcoma. In studies from the Rizzoli Institute, radiotherapy for local control has been associated with inferior EFS, overall survival,
and local control.9-11 Cox models that controlled for differences in age and tumor site between local control
groups abrogated this difference in EFS.9,10 An analysis of
191 patients with nonmetastatic Ewing sarcoma who
received treatment with an ifosfamide-containing chemotherapy regimen demonstrated that the rate of local failure
did not differ between patients treated with surgery or
radiation.12 An unadjusted analysis from Cooperative
Ewing Sarcoma Study 81 (CESS-81) indicated that the
rate of overall disease recurrence was greatest for patients
who received radiation alone,13 although this finding was

not observed in the CESS-86 trial, in which the risk of
overall disease recurrence did not differ according to the
mode of local control.14,15 In a pooled analysis of CESS
studies, patients who received definitive radiotherapy had
the highest rate of local failure.16 The overall rate of distant failure did not differ between patients who received
radiotherapy and patients whose local control included
surgery. In a second pooled CESS analysis, patients who
received definitive radiation had inferior local control and
EFS.17 None of the CESS analyses used formal statistical
methods to control for differences in patient characteristics, and the patients received heterogeneous chemotherapy regimens.
Our study has several strengths. Our sample size is
among the largest used in local control analyses. The use
of a similar chemotherapy regimen is a major strength.
This homogeneity is critical in such analyses, because

improved systemic therapy enhances not only distant disease control but also local tumor control.18 We used 2
complementary methods to control for the confounding
by indication that has led to uncertainty about the optimal
mode of local control in this disease. Both methods
yielded similar results, indicating that our findings are not
caused solely by an artifact of our novel propensity score
approach. Finally, our results are consistent with previous
analyses demonstrating inferior local control with definitive radiotherapy.
We acknowledge limitations of our analysis that
highlight potential areas for future study. In an effort to
study a homogeneous group of patients who received similar chemotherapy, we excluded patients with metastatic
disease, soft tissue tumors, and patients who had received
interval-compressed chemotherapy. The extent to which
our findings will generalize to these groups will require

surgical repair, and quality of life are important factors
included in local control decision making. These data
were not available for our study patients, although they
are being collected on new patients treated on Children’s
Oncology Group trials. In addition, our cohort was
treated over a 17-year period, during which certain aspects
of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy evolved. For
example, the duration of chemotherapy decreased from
18 cycles in INT-0091 to 14 cycles in AEWS0031. Like
in any observational study, there is the risk of residual confounding by variables that were not available for the current analysis, including inherent selection bias for
radiotherapy in patients with more locally advanced
tumors. Finally, although this is 1 of the largest analyses
on this topic to date, it is possible that some of our negative findings reflect low event rates.
In conclusion, overall disease control in Ewing sarcoma is comparable for patients who undergo surgery and
those who receive definitive radiation. The risk of local
failure is greater for patients who receive definitive radiation. Therefore, definitive surgery when appropriate
remains the preferred mode of local control, and radiotherapy is an acceptable alternative. Distant failures
account for the majority of relapses in this disease.
Because better systemic therapies improve both local and
distant disease control, our findings highlight the need for
improved systemic therapies in this disease.

failure (either isolated distant failure or combined local plus

CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES
further investigation. Detailed data on surgical margins,
radiographic and pathologic response to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, and level of experience of treating physicians were not routinely available and, thus, were not
included in this analysis. The clinical endpoints used in
this study focused on oncologic control of Ewing sarcoma,
largely ignoring other clinical endpoints impacted by local
control modalities. The risk of second malignancy, particularly of solid cancers, would be expected to be higher in
patients who receive radiation.19 Although second malignancy was included as an analytic event for the purposes
of EFS estimation, these data are not yet fully mature for
this cohort, because the AEWS0031 trial completed
accrual in 2005. Functional outcomes, need for repeat
