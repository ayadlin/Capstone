ABSTRACT
Objective: A network meta-analysis was conducted comparing the short-term
efficacies of 16 targeted drugs in combination with chemotherapy for treatment of
advanced/metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).
Results: Twenty-seven RCTs were ultimately incorporated into this network
meta-analysis. Compared with chemotherapy alone, bevacizumab + chemotherapy,
panitumumab + chemotherapy and conatumumab + chemotherapy had higher PR
rate. Bevacizumab + chemotherapy, cetuximab + chemotherapy, panitumumab +
chemotherapy, trebananib + chemotherapy and conatumumab + chemotherapy had
higher ORR rate in comparison to chemotherapy alone. Furthermore, bevacizumab
+ chemotherapy had higher DCR rate than chemotherapy alone. The results of our
cluster analysis showed that chemotherapy combined with bevacizumab, cetuximab,
panitumumab, conatumumab, ganitumab, or brivanib + cetuximab had better efficacies
for the treatment of advanced/metastatic CRC in comparison to chemotherapy alone.
Materials and Methods: Electronic databases were comprehensively searched for
potential and related randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Direct and indirect evidence
were incorporated for evaluation of stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD),
complete response (CR), partial response (PR), disease control rate (DCR) and overall
response ratio (ORR) by calculating odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI),
and using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA).
Conclusions: These results indicated that bevacizumab + chemotherapy,
panitumumab + chemotherapy, conatumumab + chemotherapy and brivanib +
cetuximab + chemotherapy may have better efficacies for the treatment of advanced/
metastatic CRC.

INTRODUCTION

with chemotherapy is the frontline treatment for
CRC; however, chemotherapy remains flawed, as the
desired therapeutic effects are achieved in only 30% of
patients. This might be due to the fact that conventional
chemotherapy drugs are toxic to both tumor and normal
tissues, and therefore cause a variety of side effects,
including neutropenia, anemia, stomach poisoning
disease, hematopoietic disorders and poisoning stem cells
[4]. The application of drugs specifically targeting tumor
tissue would reduce the interference to normal tissues and
decrease side effects [5].

Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is a malignant disease
of worldwide concern mainly affecting the elderly with
a general onset age of 66 years old [1]. According to
the World Cancer Report, there were 694,000 CRC
deaths in 2012 [2]. The survival rate for CRC in a 5-year
period increased from 51% to 65% due to developments
in medical science and treatment methods, but fatal
metastatic CRC remains is significant threat to public
health [3]. Currently, surgical resection combined

Current targeted drugs can be roughly divided into the
following categories: (1) drugs that inhibit VEGF-related
factors to reduce angiopoiesis, including bevacizumab
[6], cediranib [7], axitinib [8], and sorafenib [9]; (2) drugs
that inhibit EGFR-related factors to control tumor cell
proliferation and differentiation, including cetuximab [10],
panitumumab [11], and gefitinib [12]; (3) drugs that inhibit
angiopoietin, including sunitinib [13], celecoxib [14], and
trebananib [15]; and (4) drugs that inhibit tumor proliferation
though other relevant pathways, e.g. conatumumab causes
apoptosis of cancer cells by targeting DR5 [16] and
ganitumab inhibits tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting IGF
signaling [17]. Combined treatment with anticancer drugs
from different chemotherapy regimens is also commonly
used. A previous study demonstrated that sunitinib-based
combination was associated with more toxicity, and
combination therapy with sunitinib plus mFOLFOX6 was
not recommended in patients with metastatic colorectal
cancer [18]. Moreover, the combination use of sorafenib
in combination with mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy regimen
was not preferable in metastatic colorectal cancer [19].
Despite the abundant literature submitted, no comprehensive
literature regarding the optimal strategy on combined targeted
drugs with chemotherapy in colorectal cancer was available.
The study of targeted drugs is based on clinical
data from long-term evaluation of patients, for which the
selection of methodology is an important factor affecting
research conclusions [20]. Meta-analysis is a commonly
used clinical analytical tool; with sufficient data its
conclusions are normally reliable. However, traditional
meta-analysis is often applied to paired comparison, in
which case, the conclusions often less accurate [20].
Network meta-analysis can make up this deficiency,
implementing a direct and indirect quantified comparison
of different treatments with similar disease interventions
and then selecting the optimal treatment [21]. This study
integrates the research data of 16 targeted drugs combined
with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced/metastatic
CRC, attempting to uncover the best treatment options for
advanced/metastatic CRC through network meta-analysis.

chemotherapy. Eventually, 27 RCTs were found eligible
for this network meta-analysis [18, 19, 22–46] and the
PRISMA screening flow chart (see Figure 1). Together
these 27 RCTs included 9031 patients with advanced/
metastatic CRC, including 2584 cases treated with
chemotherapy alone (19 studies), 1936 cases treated
with bevacizumab + chemotherapy (15 studies),
1598 cases treated with cetuximab + chemotherapy
(7 studies), 632 cases treated with panitumumab +
chemotherapy (3 studies), 482 cases treated with sunitinib
+ chemotherapy (2 studies), 853 cases treated with
cediranib + chemotherapy (2 study), 19 cases treated with
celecoxib + chemotherapy (1 study ) and 97 cases treated
with sorafenib + chemotherapy (1 study), 133 cases
treated with axitinib + chemotherapy (3 studies), 95
cases treated with trebananib + chemotherapy (1 study),
51 cases treated with conatumumab + chemotherapy
(1 study), 52 cases treated with ganitumab + chemotherapy
(1 study), 137 cases treated with panitumumab +
bevacizumab + chemotherapy (1 study ), 376 cases treated
with brivanib + cetuximab + chemotherapy (1 study), 82
cases treated with axitinib + bevacizumab + chemotherapy
(2 studies), and 123 cases treated with cetuximab +
bevacizumab + chemotherapy (1 study). The included
studies were published between 2006 and 2015. Baseline
characteristics of the included studies were summarized in
Supplementary Table S1. Cochrane systematic bias for all
included studies was shown in Figure 2.

Pairwise meta-analysis
We carried out direct paired comparisons for the shortterm efficacies of 16 treatments on advanced/metastatic
CRC patients. Cetuximab + chemotherapy, sunitinib +
chemotherapy, sorafenib + chemotherapy, panitumumab
+ bevacizumab + chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic
CRC patients had lower SD rate than chemotherapy
alone (all P < 0.05). The PD rate of bevacizumab +
chemotherapy for advanced/metastatic CRC patients was
relatively lower than chemotherapy alone (OR = 0.533,
P = 0.004). Bevacizumab + chemotherapy and cetuximab
+ chemotherapy had higher PR rate than chemotherapy
alone (both P < 0.05). In terms of ORR rate, bevacizumab
+ chemotherapy, cetuximab + chemotherapy, panitumumab
+ chemotherapy were better than chemotherapy alone (all
P < 0.05). However, the CR and DCR rates of all targeted
drugs combined with chemotherapy were not significantly
different with chemotherapy alone (all P > 0.05)
(Supplementary Table S2).

the efficacy of chemotherapy alone. (6) The DCR rates
of bevacizumab + chemotherapy was better than that
of chemotherapy alone, while the efficacy of other
targeted drugs in combination with chemotherapy had
no statistical difference when compared to the efficacy
of chemotherapy (Figure 3, Supplementary Table S3).

chemotherapy, panitumumab + chemotherapy, trebananib
+ chemotherapy and conatumumab + chemotherapy were
more prominent among all the combined chemotherapies.
Evidence supported that monoclonal antibody-based
treatment of cancer has been proved as one of the most
successful therapeutic strategies for both hematologic
malignancies and solid tumors [47, 48]. Several antibodies
were included as targeted drugs in current study, including
bevacizumab and conatumumab. Bevacizumab is an antiVEGF monoclonal antibody, which has a good efficacy
and can prolong the survival time of advanced/metastatic
CRC patients [23–24]. Sorafenib is a multi-targeted
tyrosine kinase, which can control angiogenesis by
inhibiting the VEGF receptor, effective for the treatment of
tumors [29]. Besides, the combined therapy of trebananib
with anti-VEGF drugs, such as sorafenib, bevacizumab
or motesanib, presented with apparently less toxicity and
more effective in inhibiting the proliferation of tumors
cells [49, 50]. Conatumumab is a monoclonal antibody
which targets at DR5 and thus mediates the apoptosis of
tumor cells with low toxicity to normal cells [19, 27, 51].
Conatumumab is a relevant factor that can cause apoptosis
of the tumor cells and can be applied with combination of
5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and irinotecan. The combination
of these agents can reduce the toxic effects of the body
and thus distinctively mediate the apoptosis of tumor
cells [52]. Consistent with these findings, the results of
this study showed that the efficacies of bevacizumab
+ chemotherapy, panitumumab + chemotherapy,
conatumumab + chemotherapy and trebananib +
chemotherapy were relatively more significant than
the efficacy of chemotherapy alone. Panitumumab is a
complex which inhibits the expression of downstream
molecules indirectly by binding to EGFR, so as to inhibit
the proliferation and differentiation of tumor cells [24].
Trebananib is a peptide hybrid protein, which can deter

the formation of tumors by interfering with the binding of
angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 to Tie2 receptor [28].
Additionally, our study found that the efficacy of
brivanib + celecoxib + chemotherapy is distinctively
better than the efficacies of cetuximab + chemotherapy
and sorafenib + chemotherapy. A perspective study has
demonstrated that both brivanib and cetuximab inhibit
the VEGF signaling pathway, so as to cooperate with
each other in inhibiting tumor cell-induced angiogenesis
[29, 30]. Greening et al. also pointed out that the efficacy
of brivanib and cetuximab was significantly better than
the efficacy of cetuximab and cetuximab combined with
irinotecan [53]. However, no direct report proves that the
efficacy of combined brivanib and cetuximab therapy is
better than the efficacy of Sorafenib therapy. In addition,
the combined therapy of brivanib and cetuximab has
been reported to produce a certain toxicity which has a
negative impact on the overall survival of patients [28],
which may explain why the efficiency of combined
therapy of brivanib and cetuximab was inferior to that of
trebananib. However, our results revealed that the efficacy
of brivanib + celecoxib + chemotherapy is distinctively
better than the efficacy of trebananib + chemotherapy. But
further research is needed to discover the advantages and
disadvantages of both therapies. From pharmacodynamic
perspective, the advantages of the combined therapy of
brivanib and cetuximab may occur because it not only
inhibits VEGF-induced angiogenesis of tumor cells, but
also inhibits EGFR signaling pathways in parallel to
further inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells [54].
Further analysis of the results of SUCRA revealed that
the efficacies of trebananib + chemotherapy, conatumumab
+ chemotherapy, and ganitumab + chemotherapy are
relatively higher in regard to PR and ORR. This may due to
the fact that the included documents and data are relatively
limited, which may result in a deviation of the results.

Another reason may be the exclusion criteria based on the
analysis of pharmacological effects. As mentioned earlier,
trebananib is effective in inhibiting the angiogenesisrelated pathway in tumor cells [49, 50]. Ganitumab inhibits
the IGF signaling pathway by binding to IGF1R and thus
inhibits proliferation of tumor cells. Although limited data
on the efficacy of ganitumab combined with other drugs
exists, clinical research shows that combined therapy of
panitumumab and rilotumumab is much more efficacious
than ganitumab therapy alone [55]. Thus, the actual efficacy
of ganitumab therapy requires further study.

Due to the limited references and data, this study
has integrated the current number of chemotherapy drugs
which are compared and analyzed without yielding obvious
conclusions on the ideal drugs for the progression or
metastasis of advanced/metastatic CRC. Deviation occurs
in network meta-analysis when the data are insufficient
for the evaluation [56, 57]. Correction of this deviation
relies on the optimization of the new algorithm and more
clinical and basic research data for further correction and
investigation. In summary, the results of this network
meta-analysis suggest that bevacizumab + chemotherapy,

panitumumab + chemotherapy, conatumumab +

may have better efficacy for the treatment of advanced/

control rate (DCR), and overall response ratio (ORR).
The exclusion criteria were: (1) non-English reference;
(2) non-RCTs; (3) duplicated publications from the same
author with different interventions; (4) review and letters;
(5) non-human research subjects; (6) documents with
insufficient end outcomes; (7) non-fluorouracil-based
chemotherapy study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Data extraction

Search strategy

Two reviewers extracted data from the enrolled
studies using a specifically designed form. Additionally,
a third reviewer was consulted if agreement could not
be reached between these two reviewers. Two or more
researchers reviewed the RCTs according to Cochrane risk
of bias assessment tools [58], which includes six domains:
adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment,
blinding, incomplete outcome data addressed, free of
selective reporting, and free of other biases.

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane central register
of controlled trials (CENTRAL), and other English
language databases were searched from the inception of
each database through September 2015. Searches were
conducted using the keywords and combined words:
colorectal neoplasms, colorectal tumor, colorectal
cancer, colorectal carcinomas, bevacizumab, cetuximab,
panitumumab, sunitinib, cediranib, celecoxib, sorafenib,
axitinib, trebananib, conatumumab, ganitumab, gefitinib,
randomized controlled trial, and chemotherapy.

Statistical analysis
Traditional pairwise meta-analyses were performed
to directly compared the short-term efficacies (CR,
PR, ORR, SD, PD and DCR) of 16 targeted drugs
(Bevacizumab, Cetuximab, Panitumumab, Sunitinib,
Cediranib, Celecoxib, Sorafenib, Axitinib, Trebananib,
Conatumumab, Ganitumab, Gefitinib, Panitumumab
plus Bevacizumab, Brivanib plus Cetuximab, Axitinib
plus Bevacizumab, Cetuximab plus Bevacizumab) in

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria were: (1) study design:
randomized controlled trial (RCT); (2) study subjects:
advanced/metastatic CRC patients; (3) treatment regimens:
targeted drugs combined with chemotherapy; (4) end
outcomes: stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD),
complete response (CR), partial response (PR), disease

combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of
advanced/metastatic CRC. Bayesian network meta-analyses
were performed to indirectly compare CR, PR, ORR, SD,
PD and DCR of 16 targeted drugs in combination with
chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced/metastatic
CRC. Fixed-effect and random-effects model proposed
by Woods and co-workers was applied. The node-splitting
plot statistic was used to assess the extent of inconsistency,
and ontology consistent model was applied if P > 0.05.
We checked and confirmed convergence and lack of auto
correlation after four chains and a 20,000-simulation burnin phase. Direct probability statements were derived from
an additional 50,000-simulation phase [59]. The surface
under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was used to
evaluate the efficacies of 16 targeted drugs in combination
with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced/
metastatic CRC [60]. The plot of a network of interventions
is a visual representation of the evidence base and offers a
concise description of its characteristics according to the
SUCRA values, the larger the SUCRA value, the better the
rank of the intervention [61]. The network meta-analyses
were performed using Stata 13.1 (Stata Corp, College
Station, TX, USA) software and R (V.3.1.2) package gemtc
(V.0.6), 13 14 along with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
engine Open BUGS (V.3.4.0).
