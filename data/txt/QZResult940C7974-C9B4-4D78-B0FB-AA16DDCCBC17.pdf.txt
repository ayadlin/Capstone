ABSTRACT
Metastatic cancers harbor complex genomic alterations. Thus, monotherapies
are often suboptimal. Individualized combinations are needed in order to attenuate
resistance. To help inform selection of safe starting doses for novel, two-agent,
targeted drug combinations, we identified clinical trials in adult oncology patients
who received targeted drug doublets (PubMed, January 1, 2010 through December 31,
2013). The dose percentage was calculated for each drug: (safe dose in combination
divided by single agent full dose) X 100. Additive dose percentage represented the
sum of the dose percentage for each drug. A total of 144 studies (N = 8568 patients;
95 combinations) were analyzed. In 51% of trials, each of the two drugs could be
administered at 100% of their full dose. The lowest safe additive dose percentage
was 60% if targets and/or class of drugs overlapped, or in the presence of mTor
inhibitors, which sometimes compromised the combination dose. If neither class nor
target overlapped and if mTor inhibitors were absent, the lowest safe additive dose
percentage was 143%. The current observations contribute to the knowledge base
that informs safe starting doses for new combinations of targeted drugs in the context
of clinical trials or practice, hence facilitating customized combination therapies.

Combination therapies with targeted agents are
frequently adopted to overcome resistance and maximize
efficacy. This is of particular importance given that
patients with advanced cancer frequently carry multiple
genomic aberrations simultaneously. In a patientcentric approach, combined therapies would be highly
individualized, which poses challenges as to how to
ensure safe delivery of de novo combined therapies. Phase
I oncology trials are traditionally designed to address
concerns about drug safety. However, with at least 300
anti-cancer drugs approved or in advanced clinical
trials, there are about 45,000 two-drug combinations and
approximately 4,500,000 three-drug combinations, with
even higher numbers of combinations if all permutations
of drug dosing are considered. Testing each combination
therefore poses a herculean challenge. Furthermore, the
most reasonable starting doses for clinical trials with two
targeted agents remains unclear.

INTRODUCTION
A rapidly growing body of knowledge in cancer
genomics has unveiled a complicated and heterogeneous
molecular landscape in metastatic cancers. Indeed, it
has been recently reported that patients with advanced
tumors interrogated by next generation sequencing often
have unique and complex genomic profiles [1]. For
instance, in 57 patients with metastatic breast cancer,
216 somatic aberrations in 70 different genes, including
131 distinct aberrations were observed. Furthermore,
no two patients shared the same molecular portfolio
[2]. Molecular heterogeneity exists between histologies
as well as within the same diagnostic group, and even
within individual patients [3]. This diversified genomic
landscape speaks to the need for customized combination
treatments based on the genetic signature associated with
each tumor [4, 5].

Outside the cancer field, drugs are combined
routinely and safely, based on established algorithms,
for patients with multiple comorbidities. Indeed, the
average patient suffering from cancer is often on many
therapeutic agents, often designated “polypharmacy,”
for conditions as diverse as depression, heart disease,
pain, and other illnesses. The safety of these drugs in
combination has rarely if ever been formally tested in
phase I studies. Yet physicians routinely prescribe a
median of eight medications for patients with cancer,
based on an understanding of drug-drug interactions and
other factors [6]. Therefore, the prohibition against de
novo combinations of drugs, and the demand for formal
phase I testing of new combinations, often with slow and
conservative dose escalation schemes, seems to be unique
to the oncology sphere, and is perhaps a legacy from the
era of cytotoxic drugs, which are toxic and have narrow
therapeutic windows, especially compared to targeted
agents that are generally better tolerated [7]. Importantly,
within the context of oncology clinical trials, there is
often considerable uncertainty as to what the initial dose
levels should be, in the quest to balance safety, efficacy,
and efficiency. In order to explore the correlation between
dosing and toxicity for de novo combinations of targeted

agents, we conducted an analysis of previously published
clinical trials. The goal of this study was to use literature
review to establish a process that would help determine
safe initial dosing for novel combinations of two-drug
combinations of targeted agents, in order to inform both
clinical trials and practice.

RESULTS
During the four-year period of publications
evaluated, the total number of trials of two targeted
agents that met the inclusion criteria was 144 (8568
patients; 95 drug combinations) (Supplemental Table 1,
Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1). A dose percentage was
calculated to compare the dose of drug used in each
combination to the single agent recommended dose
(prioritizing the Food and Drug Administration(FDA-) approved dose or, if not FDA approved, the
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) or maximum
tolerated dose (MTD), respectively) and the sum of the
dose percentages for the combination was referred to as
the additive dose percentage (see Methods, paragraph on
Calculating “dose percentage”).

First drug at 100% dose percentage of the
FDA-approved dose/RP2D/MTD

a small molecule non-TKI and small molecule TKI; and
2 combinations, involved two small molecule non-TKIs.
In 3 of the 48 combinations where each drug was given at
100%, dose percentage, the target of the two molecules
overlapped. These included the following: gefitinib and
nimotuzumab (both targeting epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR)) [9]; bevacizumab and ABT-510
(targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF))
[8]; and trastuzumab and pertuzumab (targeting HER2)
[10, 11].
Subset analyses with two antibodies, two small
molecule inhibitors, and an antibody with a small
molecule inhibitor were performed. For all 9 studies of
two antibodies given in combination, each drug was given
at 100% of the FDA-approved dose/RP2D/MTD dose.
When two small molecules were administered, each drug
could be administered at 100% of the dose in 25 of the
68 total trials (37%) (Table 3). When a small molecule
and antibody were administered in combination, each drug
could be administered at 100% in 40 out of 55 total trials
(73%) (Table 3). Limitations of this analysis are due to the
small number of antibody-antibody combinations (N = 9).

Between January 1, 2010 and December 31,
2013, 121 trials (including 78 drug combinations) were
published (N = 7748 patients) where both agents were
targeted and at least one was given at full (100%) dose
[8–18] (Supplemental references 1 to 110) (Table 2).
These included 47 phase I trials (N = 1449 patients), 63
Phase II or III trials (N = 5742 patients), and 11 phase I/II
combined trials (N = 557 patients). (In the phase I trials,
only a subset of patients were treated at the RP2D/MTD)
The median dose percentage for the second agent
was at 100% of the FDA-approved dose/RP2D/MTD
(range, 25% to 100%). The median (range) for the
additive dose percentage was 200% (125% to 200%) of
the additive FDA-approved dose/RP2D/MTD. The lowest
safe additive dose percentage was 125%; this lower dose
was needed in some studies where both drugs were of the
same class, i.e., small molecule inhibitors.
In total, 75 trials (51% of the 144 trials of the trials)
(N = 48 drug combinations) administered each targeted
agent at 100% dose percentage (N = 5229 patients
received each drug at 100% dose percentage). These trials
(wherein additive dose percentage was 200%) included
the following types of combinations: 10 combinations
that involved an antibody and small molecule tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI); 7 combinations, two antibodies; 17
combinations, antibody and small molecule non-TKI; 6
combinations, two small molecule TKIs; 6 combinations,

First drug at >50% but < 100% dose percentage
of the FDA-approved dose/RP2D/MTD
There were 13 trials (N = 13 drug combinations)
where the first drug was administered at >50% but < 100%
of the FDA-approved dose/RP2D/MTD due to toxicity of
higher doses [19–21] (Supplemental references 111-120).

Figure 2: Graphical summary of additive dose percentages for two targeted therapies. In 51% of studies both drugs could

be administered at 100% of the FDA-approved dose/RP2D/MTD. In only 2% of studies (N = 3 studies) was the additive dose percentage
tried ≤100% and no safe dose found. For the bevacizumab and sorafenib combination, other studies have found acceptable safety at 50%
and 25% of the dose [22] or for 50% and 50% of the dose [30]. The only combination with undefined safety dosing in this group (and
no alternative studies demonstrating safety) was the combination of pazopanib and temsirolimus [27]; dose-limiting toxicity in this trial
included fatigue, and did not include acute irreversible events.

bevacizumab and vatalinib (VEGFR inhibitor) [26] were
published, where both agents were targeted and the first
drug was administered at ≤ 50% dose percentage of the
FDA-approved dose/RP2D/MTD due to toxicity of higher
doses, thus the additive dose percentage was ≤ 100% of
the additive FDA-approved dose/RP2D/MTD. The dose
percentage for bevacizumab and sorafenib was 50% and

60% and 60%, respectively) applied to bevacizumab and
sorafenib, bevacizumab and telatinib, and bevacizumab
and vatalinib, which, in each case, overlap in their
targeting angiogenesis. In addition, the combination of

the toxicity was fatigue, which is often hard to quantify
[27] (Table 2).

mTor inhibitor-based combinations
Combinations with mTor inhibitors such as
everolimus or temsirolimus often required compromised
doses: (i) the combination of sorafenib (100% of dose)
with everolimus necessitated dosing the latter at 25%
[12]; (ii) the everolimus dose was reduced to 25% in
combination with imatinib, when used at 100% [13, 14];
(iii) when sunitinib (75% of dose) was combined with
everolimus, only 29% of the dose of the latter could be
given [20]; and (iv) as mentioned above, the dose of
pazopanib (25%) and temsirolimus (40%) resulted in dose
limiting toxicity of fatigue [27].

interest, for the bevacizumab and sorafenib combination,
other studies have found acceptable safety at 50% and

DISCUSSION

clinical trials, that patients who received lower drug
doses did not fare worse than those on higher doses, and
suggested that targeted agents may have different dose
response relationships than cytotoxic chemotherapies
[39]. A separate study of 55 clinical trials sponsored by a
single entity with multiple sites suggested that patients on
higher doses had better response rates and overall survival
[40]. Thus, it is unclear if dose reductions to allow for the
administration of multiple agents will alter efficacy.
This study has several limitations. First, the
publications reviewed for the current analysis were limited
to two-drug combinations (targeted agents) in adult
patients without organ dysfunction. The results are likely
not applicable to patients with renal or hepatic impairment,
or children, who may require dosing modifications
depending on metabolism of the therapeutic or maturation,
respectively, and were excluded from the current
analysis as often occurs in clinical trials. In addition,
immunotherapies, hormonal modulators, and cytotoxics
were not included, which may alter the additive dose
percentages seen in the study as hormonal modulators and
immunotherapies may be better tolerated in combination
therapy while cytotoxics may increase toxicity. It is also
plausible that some trials with two targeted agents that
showed significant toxicity were never published, and
so the data presented herein, while derived from a large
number of patients, does not guarantee safety with all
possible drug combinations. Drug-drug interactions and
effects on metabolic proteins such as CYP enzymes, which
can lead to changes in the pharmacokinetic profile of
therapeutics, may have resulted in lower safe dose levels
for combination therapy as compared to single agent
dosing. While this was not addressed in the study, we still
observed that, in 51% of trials, both drugs could still be
administered at 100% of their FDA-approved dose/RP2D/
MTD. The study also did not address target engagement
for therapy where optimal doses may be lower than the
FDA-approved dose/RP2D/MTD. Still it is of interest that
for some drugs such as everolimus, administering 5 mg
(which is 50% of the approved dose) offers 100% target
engagement [41]. Another limitation of the study was
that it included different types of trials (phase I, phase II,
phase III trials) with different primary objectives. Finally,
there are myriad of possible dosing schemes and some
investigators or practitioners may want to hold one of the
drugs at a preconceived dosing level. While our study did
define that, if one drug is held at 100%, the lowest safe
additive dosing percentage was 125%, it was not possible
to define all permutations because they do not exist in the
literature reviewed.
In conclusion, classical cytotoxic chemotherapy
dosing was previously limited by significant toxicity,
and thus the administration of two or more drugs in
combination often necessitated very conservative initial
dosing, even within the controlled environment of a

Targeted agents matched to advanced tumors bearing
cognate alterations are often given as monotherapy. While
significant salutary effects can be achieved [5, 33, 34]
responses generally last only a few months. This is perhaps
not surprising since metastatic malignancies mostly harbor
multiple genomic alterations [35–38], strongly suggesting
that individualized combination treatment will be need to
be deployed to further improve outcomes.
When two targeted agents are combined, safety
considerations may include whether both belong to
the same class of drugs (e.g., both are small molecule
inhibitors) or if there are overlapping targets (e.g. both
target angiogenesis) [7]. In the current study, we have
reviewed phase I-III clinical trials of targeted therapeutics
over a four-year span (N = 8568 patients) to determine
safe starting doses for novel two-drug combinations of
targeted agents.
In over half of the studies, both drugs could be given
at 100% of the individually defined optimum dose (i.e.,
the FDA-approved dose or RP2D or MTD) (Table 2).
When giving full doses was not possible, studies were
able to define safe starting doses by lowering the additive
dose percentage of the combination. When one drug
was given at 100% of the full dose, the lowest safe dose
for the second drug was 25%. Lowering the dose was
needed in the presence of two drugs of the same class
when both were small molecule inhibitors or two drugs
with overlapping targets. In some cases, neither drug
was administered at 100% of the full dose. The lowest
additive dose percentage was 60% and was relevant to
bevacizumab and telatinib, and bevacizumab and vatalinib,
which overlapped in their target of angiogenesis [25, 26].
However, other studies were able to administer 100%
of each agent (200% additive dose percentage) despite
overlapping targets: gefitinib and nimotuzumab (targeting
EGFR) [9]; bevacizumab and ABT-510 (targeting VEGF)
[8]; and trastuzumab and pertuzumab (targeting HER2)
[10, 11]. Thus, the presence of overlapping targets needs
to be considered for starting doses, but, in many cases,
will not limit the ability to administer full doses of agents.
Combinations that included mTor inhibitors such as
everolimus or temsirolimus also resulted in compromised
doses. At times, these combinations could not be given
at more than 65 to 100% of the additive dose percentage.
Finally, the lowest safe additive dose percentage for drugs
with non-overlapping targets or class was 143%.
In implementing novel drug combinations tailored
to the genomic aberration of each individual cancer,
considerations include efficacy of the combination and
toxicity. The effect of administration of less than 100%
of the single agent MTD for combination therapies was
addressed in two separate studies of phase I data. Jain
et al demonstrated, in a single institution study of 24

clinical trial. Although targeted therapies can have fewer
side effects than traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy,
a process to calculate initial safe doses, either within
a clinical trial or in practice, for combinations of
two targeted agents, remains a matter of debate. The
molecular heterogeneity of cancer indicates that
prosecuting malignancies with an optimized personalized/
precision medicine strategy will require combination
therapy matched to individual molecular profiles. Yet,
with an increasing number of targeted agents deployed
in the clinic, there are thousands of drug combinations
possible, and there is an increasingly urgent need for
more knowledge that can inform safely combining
them. Outside of oncology, for patients with multiple
comorbidities, drugs are routinely given together based
on established algorithms; indeed, the average cancer
patient is on 5 to 10 drugs for their other health problems,
often before starting treatment for their malignancy. The
current study documented the following in adults with
intact organ function treated with two targeted agents: (i)
compromised dosing most often was needed for overlap
of drug class (e.g., two small molecule inhibitors (but not
two antibodies)) and/or targets (especially angiogenesis)
or in the presence of mTor inhibitors; (ii) without overlap
of class or target and in the absence of mTor inhibitors,
the lowest safe additive dose percentage was 143%; (iii)
in the presence of overlapping class and/or targets and/or
mTor inhibitors, the lowest safe additive dose percentage
was about 60%; and (iv) dose escalation to full dose
was possible with most two targeted drug combinations,
since over half of these combinations were administered
safely at 100% dose percentage of the FDA-approved/
RP2D/MTD of each drug (additive dose percentage =
200%). Therefore starting doses of two targeted drugs
in combination in a clinical trial or practice could be
about 70% of each drug if there is no overlap in targets
or class and no mTor inhibitor in the regimen, and about
30% of each drug with overlap of class and/or target or
inclusion of an mTor inhibitor. If one drug was held at
100% of full dose, the lowest safe starting dose of the
second drug was 25%, and this was required in the case
of overlapping drug class/target. Since over half of the
combinations could be given with both drugs at full dose,
in the absence of significant toxicity, intra-patient dose
escalation can occur, to allow for improved efficacy if
needed. Of course, further adjustments may be needed,
depending on co-morbidities, patient age, organ function,
other concomitant medications, and consideration of
absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion
(ADME) of individual drugs. Despite these limitations,
our current observations can help inform the safe starting
dose of de novo two targeted agent combinations, both in
clinical trials and practice, as a step toward customization
of therapy to the complex molecular landscape seen in
patients with cancer.

To identify research articles for the analysis, we
first conducted a search of PubMed for studies published
between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013,
using the search terms “cancer, phase, combination.”
We then manually screened the resulting articles and
included studies that meet the inclusion criteria: (i)
phase I-III clinical trials; (ii) solid tumors or hematology
malignancy; and (iii) two-drug combination therapy
where both drugs were targeted agents. Targeted agents
are generally cytostatic and broadly include antibodies
that have a specific protein as their target or small
molecule inhibitors with low nM IC50s (concentration
that results in 50% inhibition of enzyme function) for
the specific protein target. Exclusion criteria were as
follows: (i) the dose of any drug in the combination
was greater than 100% of the standard dose as a single
agent; (ii) the dose of any drug in the combination was
chosen to be low due to reasons other than toxicity, such
as optimized activity at lower doses due to different
biological impact; (iii) the study was performed on
selected patient populations such as pediatric, elderly,
or patients with organ dysfunction; and (iv) the study
treatment regimen included radiation. Hormonal agents
and immonotherapeutics were excluded.

Data
Clinical data were manually extracted from each
clinical trial. Data included drug names, targets of action
(the target of small molecule inhibitors was felt to be
relevant if it was impacted at an IC50 <250 nM [42]),
drug type, status of Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approval, number of drugs in the combination,
disease, number of participants, dose of each drug in
the combination, recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) or
maximal tolerated dose (MTD) achieved in the study, dose
limiting toxicities (DLTs), and grade ≥ 3 toxicities.

Calculating “dose percentage”
Based on the extracted data, a “dose percentage”
was calculated, which was defined as the dose of one
drug in the combination, divided by the standard dose of
the same drug used as a single agent, multiplied by 100
((dose percentage = dose of drug in the combination/
standard dose of drug as a single agent) X 100). Single
agent dose was defined as the FDA approved dose, or for
drugs that were not FDA approved, the RP2D or MTD
dose from phase I studies. FDA approved dose was
always prioritized as the reference full dose and RP2D
was prioritized over MTD. For drugs where the standard
single agent dosing could be variable, we defined the
lower standard dose as the accepted dose. “Additive dose

percentage” for combinations of two targeted agents was
calculated by adding the dose percentage of each drug in
a given combination. Hence, in combination therapy, if
the maximum safe dose percentage of drug A was 50% of
the FDA-approved dose/RP2D/MTD of drug A as a single
agent, and the maximum safe dose percentage of drug B
was 25% of the FDA-approved dose/RP2D/MTD of drug
B as a single agent, the “additive dose percentage” of
the combination was 75%. The maximum “additive dose
percentage” for any two-drug combination is 200% (i.e.,
100% of each drug). The “first drug” was defined as the
drug with the highest dose percentage of the combination
(i.e., the drug with the dose that was closest to the FDAapproved dose/RP2D/MTD).
