ABSTRACT:
Archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens were
collected from advanced NSCLC patients enrolled in LETS phase III trial comparing
first-line S-1/carboplatin with paclitaxel/carboplatin and subjected to multiplex
genotyping for 214 somatic hotspot mutations in 26 genes (LungCarta Panel) and
20 major variants of ALK, RET, and ROS1 fusion genes (LungFusion Panel) with the
Sequenom MassARRAY platform. MET amplification was evaluated by fluorescence in
situ hybridization. A somatic mutation in at least one gene was identified in 48% of
non–squamous cell carcinoma and 45% of squamous cell carcinoma specimens, with
EGFR (17%), TP53 (11%), STK11 (9.8%), MET (7.6%), and KRAS (6.2%). Mutations
in EGFR or KRAS were associated with a longer or shorter median overall survival,
respectively. The LungFusion Panel identified ALK fusions in six cases (2.5%), ROS1
fusions in five cases (2.1%), and a RET fusion in one case (0.4%), with these three
types of rearrangement being mutually exclusive. Nine (3.9%) of 229 patients were
found to be positive for de novo MET amplification. This first multiplex genotyping of
NSCLC associated with a phase III trial shows that MassARRAY-based genetic testing
for somatic mutations and fusion genes performs well with nucleic acid derived from
FFPE specimens of NSCLC tissue.

INTRODUCTION

of different genetic alterations and therapeutic targets in
NSCLC patients can profoundly affect the response to
therapy (17). The clinical implementation of genomic
profiling for NSCLC with high-throughput and multiplex
genotyping tests is thus warranted in order to prioritize
appropriate therapies for individual patients (18).
We have previously presented the results of the Lung
Cancer Evaluation of TS-1 (LETS) study (19, 20). This
multicenter randomized phase III trial demonstrated the
noninferiority of the combination of S-1 and carboplatin
compared with that of paclitaxel and carboplatin in terms
of overall survival (OS) for chemotherapy-naïve patients
with advanced NSCLC. Our West Japan Oncology Group
(WJOG) has now embarked on multiplex genomic
analyses of the archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tumor specimens collected from the patients
enrolled in the LETS study. The primary platform for
genotyping of tumors adopted in the present study is
the Sequenom MassARRAY system, which combines
multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis
with single-base primer extension, followed by analysis
of the primer extension products by matrix-assisted laser
desorption-ionization (MALDI)–time-of-flight (TOF)
mass spectrometry. We thus conducted high-throughput
genotyping of 214 somatic hotspot mutations in 26 genes
(LungCarta Panel) (Supplementary Table S1) as well
as of 20 major variants of ALK, RET, and ROS1 fusion
genes (LungFusion Panel). Given that recent preclinical
and clinical studies have also implicated de novo MET
amplification as an oncogenic driver (21-23), we also
evaluated MET amplification in available tumor specimens
by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

Lung cancer is the leading cause of death related
to cancer worldwide,with non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) accounting for 85% of lung cancer cases (1).
Advanced or metastatic NSCLC has been treated with
platinum-based chemotherapies in a manner dependent
on tumor histological features, with consideration given
to the balance between the modest efficacy and side
effects of such treatment. Over the last decade, however,
substantial progress has been made in the development of
genotype-based targeted therapies for advanced NSCLC.
The success of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the treatment of
EGFR mutation–positive advanced NSCLC established
a proof of concept that molecularly targeted agents are
far more effective than conventional chemotherapy
when administered to the appropriate genetically defined
patient population (2-7). Somatic mutations in other
genes including KRAS, HER2, PIK3CA, BRAF, and
DDR2 have also been investigated as potential targets
for genotype-based treatment approaches in NSCLC (8).
More recently, the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
TKI crizotinib was approved with a companion diagnostic
test for the treatment of a relatively small (up to 3 to 5%)
subset of patients with advanced NSCLC who harbor
ALK rearrangements (9-11). The subsequent discovery
of ROS1 and RET rearrangements as potentially treatable
targets suggested that several chromosomal translocations
and corresponding gene fusions may serve as a driving
force for NSCLC (12-16). These findings have highlighted
the genetic diversity of NSCLC, which can no longer be
considered a single disease. Furthermore, the coexistence

specimens contained no tumor cells and were excluded
from further analysis. The remaining 295 specimens were
subjected to extraction of DNA and RNA, yielding median
amounts of 504 ng (range, 33 to 25,230 ng) and 516 ng
(range, 6 to 32,795 ng), respectively. The numbers of
evaluable patients were 275 for somatic gene mutations
(LungCarta Panel), 240 for fusion gene characterization
(LungFusion Panel), and 229 for MET amplification
(FISH) (Figure 1). The characteristics of these groups of
patients, including the efficacy results, were similar overall

Patients and sample collection
FFPE specimens obtained at diagnosis were

mutations were mutually exclusive. Of the 46 patients with
EGFR mutations, three also harbored PIK3CA mutations.
Four patients with KRAS mutations also had an additional
mutation in STK11, in TP53 and PTEN, in TP53, or in
MET.
The median OS of EGFR mutation–positive patients
was significantly longer than that of patients without
EGFR mutations (23.7 vs. 12.6 months, P = 0.004) (Figure
2D). Conversely, patients with KRAS mutations had a
significantly shorter median OS than did those with wildtype KRAS (9.99 vs. 15.3 months, P = 0.040) (Figure 2D).

Analysis of somatic gene mutations
Of the 295 specimens referred for somatic mutation
analysis, 275 (93.2%) provided mutational profiles with
a >90% success rate for genotyping (Figure 1). Somatic
mutations in at least one gene were identified in 105 (48%)
of the 217 patients with non–squamous cell carcinoma
(non-SCC) and in 26 (45%) of the 58 patients with SCC.
Twenty-five (9.1%) specimens (20 non-SCC, 5 SCC) were
positive for mutations in two genes, and three non-SCC
tumors each had mutations in three genes (Figure 2A).
Overall, we identified EGFR mutations in 46 patients
(17%), TP53 mutations in 30 (11%), STK11 mutations
in 27 (9.8%), MET mutations in 21 (7.6%), KRAS
mutations in 17 (6.2%), PIK3CA mutations in 6 (2.2%),
BRAF and NRAS mutations in 3 each (1.1%), NOTCH1
mutations in 2 (0.7%), and DDR2, EPHA3, EPHA5,
ERBB2, MAP2K1, NRF2, and PTEN mutations in 1 each
(0.4%) (Figure 2B). Among the 46 patients with EGFR
mutations, 15 individuals (33%) had a deletion in exon
19 and 24 individuals (52%) had a point mutation (L858R
or L861Q) in exon 21, whereas three patients had point
mutations in exon 18, two had point mutations in exon
19, and two had mutations in exon 20 (Supplementary
Table S2). Mutation profiles for patients harboring at least

Fusion gene characterization
We previously established an assay system based
on the MassARRAY platform for detecting EML4-ALK
in FFPE biopsy specimens of advanced NSCLC (24). In
the present study, we further developed a new multiplex
system for MassARRAY assays (LungFusion Panel)
focused on the capture of 20 major variants of ALK, RET,
and ROS1 fusion genes (Supplementary Tables S3 to S5).
The LungFusion Panel assays detected plasmid DNA
corresponding to the 20 different fusion variants with the
expected mass spectra (Supplementary Figure S1), with
the lower threshold for detection ranging from 5 to 60
copies (Supplementary Table S6).

RET, and ROS1 rearrangements were 2.5%, 0.4%, and
2.1%, respectively, and these three types of rearrangement
were mutually exclusive. Clinicopathologic characteristics
of the 12 fusion-positive patients are shown in Table 2.
Although these patients tended to be younger than the
fusion-negative patients (median age of 58 vs. 64 years),
there was no statistically significant difference in age, sex
distribution, smoking history, tumor histological type, or

CCDC6-RET fusion in one case, and ROS1 fusions in five
cases (three SLC34A2-ROS1, one LRIG3v1-ROS1, and
one CD74-ROS1) (Figure 3). The frequencies of ALK,

disease stage between these two groups. Among the ALK
fusion–positive patients, two individuals had concurrent
STK11 (F354L) mutations and one had a MET (N375S)
mutation (Table 2). Among the five ROS1 fusion–positive
patients, two individuals also had a KRAS mutation (G12V
or G12A) and one had EGFR (L858R), PIK3CA (E542K),
and STK11 (F354L) mutations (Table 2). The median OS
was 19.5 and 13.8 months (P = 0.89) for fusion-positive
and fusion-negative patients, respectively.

multiplex assay panels based on Sequenom’s MassARRAY
platform. The LungCarta Panel encompasses 214 distinct
mutations in 26 genes previously annotated in NSCLC.
Although collection of tumor material was not mandatory
in the LETS study, FFPE archival tumor specimens were
obtained from more than half of the advanced NSCLC
patients enrolled in the study. Although most of the
collected specimens were obtained by transbronchial
biopsy and were small in size, >90% were successfully
genotyped, thus satisfying the dual requirements of
pathological diagnosis and multiplex analysis of somatic
mutations with a single biopsy sample. We detected
mutations in at least one gene in about half of the tested
subjects, consistent with previous studies performed with
other platforms (25). The frequency of EGFR mutations in
our study (17%) is lower than that previously determined
for Japanese patients with NSCLC (26). Given that EGFR
mutation tests have been commercially available with
insurance coverage since 2007 in Japan, the reason for this
difference is likely that many EGFR mutation–positive
patients were not enrolled in the LETS study because
EGFR-TKIs were available as a first-line treatment option.
The bias toward a higher percentage of wild-type EGFR
patients may also have affected the observed incidence
of other somatic mutations, including both those that
are nonoverlapping or associated with EGFR mutations.
The 6% prevalence of KRAS mutations in our cohort is
also lower than the frequency reported for Caucasian
patients, consistent with the previously described ethnic
differences in the incidence of KRAS mutations (26). We
also retrospectively evaluated the influence of EGFR or
KRAS genotype on survival outcome for the advanced
NSCLC patients enrolled in the LETS study. EGFR
mutation–positive patients had a significantly superior OS
compared with individuals with wild-type EGFR, likely
because most mutation-positive patients received EGFRTKIs as second-line or later chemotherapy. On the other
hand, patients who had tumors with wild-type KRAS had a
significantly better survival compared with those who had

MET amplification
MET copy number was evaluated by FISH in 229
cases and was detected in 9 cases (3.9%) (Figure 4A–C),
among which the median gene copy number was 8.8
(range, 6.1 to 15.3). All MET amplification–positive
patients had non-SCC (5.2%, 9 of 174 patients) and
most were male and smokers (Table 3). Two of these
patients had a TP53 mutation, either alone or together
with an STK11 mutation, and one patient had two EGFR
mutations (E709A + G719S) (Table 3). Although the
median OS tended to be shorter for MET amplification–
positive patients than for amplification-negative patients
(10.7 vs. 13.8 months), this difference was not statistically
significant (Figure 4D).

DISCUSSION
As the number of molecularly targeted therapies
for molecularly defined subsets of patients with NSCLC
increases, there is an increasing need for high-throughput
genotyping tests to evaluate the corresponding genetic
abnormalities. The successful clinical application of such
tests will depend on attainment of robust performance with
minute samples derived from the FFPE tumor material
collected for pathological diagnosis. In the present study,
we tested FFPE specimens of NSCLC tissue for multiple
genetic abnormalities simultaneously with the use of

KRAS mutations. Given that some patients with wild-type
KRAS had EGFR mutations or ALK, RET, or ROS1 fusion
genes, however, we also compared the survival outcome
of KRAS mutation–positive patients with that of wildtype KRAS patients negative for these treatable targets.
Although KRAS mutation–positive patients showed a trend
toward a shorter survival compared with those negative
for KRAS and EGFR mutations as well as for fusion genes
(9.99 vs. 12.9 months, P = 0.113) (Supplementary Figure
S2), the negative prognostic value of KRAS mutations
remains uncertain on the basis of the data in the present
study.
Several oncogenic gene fusions have recently
been identified in NSCLC. EML4-ALK was the first such
fusion detected in NSCLC, with its discovery in 2007
(9) being followed by the identification of ROS1 and
RET fusions in 2012 (12-15). Although the frequency of
each of these types of fusion gene is only ~1 to 5% in
unselected NSCLC patients, the affected patient subsets
are treatable with corresponding kinase inhibitors. A
break-apart FISH assay is the FDA-approved diagnostic
test to screen for ALK rearrangement in NSCLC. FISH
is thus currently considered the standard diagnostic
technology for gene rearrangement, but its high cost
and requirement for technical expertise limit its clinical
application. Furthermore, timely acquisition of genotype
information including oncogenic gene fusion status
is required to guide rapid initiation of appropriate
molecularly targeted therapies. The development of novel
platforms that allow simultaneous screening for ALK,
ROS1, and RET fusions is thus urgently needed. In the
present study, we extended the MassARRAY technique to
develop a multiplex screen (LungFusion Panel) designed
to assess RNA isolated from FFPE biopsy specimens
for ALK, ROS1, and RET fusion genes simultaneously.
In this initial proof-of-concept effort, we confirmed
robust performance of the LungFusion assay with 240
FFPE clinical samples obtained from advanced NSCLC
patients, revealing a prevalence of 2.5%, 2.1%, and 0.4%
for ALK, ROS1, and RET fusion genes, respectively. We
also confirmed the mutual exclusivity of these three types
of fusion gene. Of note, we found that three of five ROS1
fusion–positive patients harbored concurrent actionable
oncogenic somatic mutations of EGFR, PIK3CA, or
KRAS. A 65-year-old woman who had never smoked
had adenocarcinoma harboring SLC34A2-ROS1 as well
as EGFR (L858R) and PIK3CA (E542K) mutations.
Two previous studies of Asian populations also detected
coexistence of EGFR mutations and ROS1 rearrangements
in NSCLC patients (27, 28). Given that our cohort was
also exclusively Japanese, the high prevalence of EGFR
mutations in Asian patients with NSCLC may increase
the chance for detection of coexistence of these two types
of genetic alterations. As far as we are aware, the abovementioned 65-year-old woman in our cohort is the first
reported patient with both a ROS1 fusion and a PIK3CA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mutation. We also detected KRAS mutations (G12V or
G12A) in two SLC34A2-ROS1–positive patients, with
coexistence of ROS1 rearrangement and KRAS mutation
not having been previously described. Further studies
are warranted to investigate whether the overlap between
these oncogenes is clinically relevant and might affect the
choice of optimal therapy.
We have previously shown that inhibition of MET
signaling either with the small-molecule MET and ALK
inhibitor crizotinib or by RNA interference targeted to
MET mRNA resulted in marked antitumor effects in MET
amplification–positive NSCLC cell lines both in vitro and
in vivo (21). Furthermore, NSCLC patients with de novo
MET amplification have shown a pronounced clinical
response to crizotinib (22, 23), which was originally
developed as a TKI for c-MET. These preclinical and
clinical findings suggest that de novo MET amplification
is an oncogenic driver for, and therefore a valid target
for the treatment of, NSCLC. The clinicopathologic
profile of advanced NSCLC patients with de novo MET
amplification remains largely unknown, however. Several
studies performed with different methods and different
criteria for definition of gene amplification have reported
a frequency of de novo MET amplification in NSCLC
ranging from 2% to 20% (29). In the present study, we
applied strict guidelines of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists for
the definition of gene amplification and thereby identified
9 out of 229 advanced NSCLC patients (3.9%) as having
de novo MET amplification. Eight of these nine patients
had adenocarcinoma and one had adenosquamous
carcinoma histology. Although most of the nine patients
were male and smokers, no specific clinicopathologic
feature was significantly associated with de novo MET
amplification. The notion that tumors positive for de novo
MET amplification, EGFR mutations, or oncogenic (ALK,
ROS1, RET) fusions are distinct biological entities was
supported by our finding that, with one exception, these
genetic alterations were mutually exclusive.
There are several potential limitations to our study.
First, although we detected significant survival differences
between advanced NSCLC patients positive or negative
for EGFR or KRAS mutations, the analysis did not take
into account other prognostic factors and should be
interpreted within the context of its retrospective nature.
Second, although the LungCarta Panel encompasses
>200 mutations across 26 cancer genes, important
gene mutations may be present outside of the selected
hotspot regions. Given that the MassARRAY system
involves multiple primer sets for both PCR amplification
and primer extension, the addition of new mutations to
existing panels is straightforward but still requires effort.
Lastly, we performed molecular testing with a single
biopsy specimen, which may not be representative of all
sites within a tumor.
In summary, the present study constitutes the
2300

first multiplex genotyping analysis of patients with
advanced NSCLC enrolled in a phase III clinical trial.
Such an approach will be important for future evaluation
of the clinical impact of specific genetic alterations
and predictive biomarkers. Our data indicate that
MassARRAY-based multiplex genetic testing both for
somatic mutations and for ALK, ROS1, and RET fusion
genes performed well with nucleic acid (DNA and RNA)
extracted from FFPE tumor specimens obtained from
patients with advanced NSCLC.

The genes in the LungCarta Panel are listed in
Supplementary Table S1. Multiplex PCR was performed
in a volume of 5 μL containing 1 U of Hotstart Taq
polymerase (Sequenom), 1.1 to 10 ng of genomic DNA,
the LungCarta PCR primer pool(Sequenom), and 500
μmol of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP). The
PCR protocol included incubation at 95°C for 15 min; 45
cycles of incubation at 94°C for 20 s, 56°C for 30 s, and
72°C for 60 s; and a final incubation at 72°C for 3 min.
Unincorporated dNTPs were deactivated by incubation
with 0.5 U of shrimp alkaline phosphatase　(Sequenom) at
37°C for 40 min, after which the enzyme was inactivated
by incubation for 5 min at 85°C. Single-base primer
extension was performed with the LungCarta extension
primer pool (Sequenom), 0.2 µL of mass-modified
dNTPs (Sequenom), and 1.15 U of Thermosequenase
enzyme (Sequenom). The extension protocol included
incubation at 94°C for 30 s; 60 cycles of incubation at
94°C for 5 s, 52°C for 5 s, and 80°C for 5 s; and a final
incubation at 72°C for 3 min. After the addition of a
cation-exchange resin to remove residual salt followed by
41 μL of water, the extension products were spotted onto
a matrix pad (3-hydroxypicolinic acid) of a SpectroCHIP
II (Sequenom) for analysis with a Bruker MALDITOF mass spectrometer. Spectra were processed with
SpectroREADER software (Sequenom) and transferred
to the MassARRAY Typer 4 Analyzer (Sequenom) for
further analysis.

METHODS
Patients and sample collection
The design and results of the LETS study have
been described previously [19,20]. In brief, the study
subjects comprised patients aged 20 to 74 years with a
histopathologic diagnosis of stage IIIB or IV NSCLC,
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status of 0 or 1, and preserved function of
major organ systems. They had not previously received
chemotherapy, and they were randomly assigned in a
1:1 ratio to treatment with either carboplatin plus S-1
or carboplatin plus paclitaxel. The present study was
designed retrospectively after completion of the first
interim analysis of the LETS trial and was approved by the
institutional ethics committee of each of the participating
institutions. Archival FFPE tumor specimens were
collected for diagnosis from the participants of the LETS
study at 22 centers and were shipped to Kinki University
Faculty of Medicine.

Fusion gene detection by mass spectrometry
PCR and extension primers were designed to
specifically amplify the breakpoint junction regions for 20
types of fusion gene (Supplementary Tables S3–S5) with
the use of MassARRAY Assay Designer 3.1 (Sequenom).
The detection technique has been described previously.25
Reverse-transcribed cDNA was subjected to PCR in
a volume of 5 μL containing 1 U of Taq polymerase
(Sequenom), 500 µmol of each dNTP, and 200 nmol of
each PCR primer. The PCR protocol included incubation
at 95°C for 15 min; 45 cycles of incubation at 94°C
for 20 s, 56°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s; and a final
incubation at 72°C for 3 min. Unincorporated dNTPs were
deactivated by incubation with 0.5 U of shrimp alkaline
phosphatase (Sequenom) at 37°C for 40 min, after which
the enzyme was inactivated by incubation for 5 min at
85°C. Single-base primer extension was performed with
the LungFusion extension primer pool (depending on
the mass), 0.2 µL of mass-modified dNTPs (Sequenom),
and 1 U of iPLEX enzyme (Sequenom). The extension
protocol included incubation at 94°C for 30 s; 40 cycles
of incubation at 94°C for 5 s, 52°C for 5 s, and 80°C for
5 s; and a final incubation at 72°C for 3 min. After the

Sample processing
The collected FFPE specimens underwent
histological review, and only those containing sufficient
tumor cells as revealed by hematoxylin-eosin staining were
subjected to nucleic acid extraction. DNA and RNA were
purified with the use of an Allprep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The isolated RNA was subjected
to reverse transcription with the use of a High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). The DNA and RNA samples were
analyzed in the following order of priority: (1) multiplex
analysis of somatic gene mutations (LungCarta Panel;
Sequenom, San Diego, CA), (2) quantitative analysis of
gene expression (results to be described elsewhere), and
(3) characterization of ALK, ROS1, and RET fusion genes
(LungFusion Panel).

FISH
FISH was performed to determine MET copy
number in FFPE tumor specimens with the use of a
c-Met/CEN7p Dual Color FISH Probe (GSP Laboratory,
Kawasaki, Japan), where CEN7p is the centromeric
region of chromosome 7p. After screening of all sections,
images of tumor cells were captured and recorded, and
the signals for at least 50 random nuclei were counted
for an area in which individual cells were recognized in
each of at least 10 representative images. Nuclei with a
disrupted boundary were excluded from the analysis.
Gene amplification was strictly defined on the basis
of a mean MET/CEN7p copy number ratio of >2.2, as
previously described (30). Polysomy or an equivocal
MET/CEN7p ratio (1.8 to 2.2) was thus scored as negative
for amplification.

OS in patients for each biomarker analysis was
estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed
with a Cox proportional-hazard model. Differences in
OS between genotypes were evaluated with the log-rank
test. All statistical analysis was performed with SAS for
Windows, release 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and JMP
software (version 10, SAS Institute). A P value of <0.05
was considered statistically significant.
