Abstract
Mortality from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cancer (PDAC) is among the highest of any cancer and
frontline therapy has changed little in years. Activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, NOS3, or NOS
III) has been implicated recently in the pathogenesis of PDACs. In this study, we used genetically engineered
mouse and human xenograft models to evaluate the consequences of targeting eNOS in PDACs. Genetic
deﬁciency in eNOS limited the development of preinvasive pancreatic lesions and trended toward an extended
lifespan in mice with advanced pancreatic cancer. These effects were also observed upon oral administration of
the clinically evaluated NOS small molecule inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Similarly, other
transgenic models of oncogenic KRas–driven tumors responded to L-NAME treatment. Finally, these results were
recapitulated in xenograft models of human pancreatic cancer, in which L-NAME was found to broadly inhibit
tumorigenic growth. Taken together, our ﬁndings offer preclinical proof-of-principle to repurpose L-NAME for
clinical investigations in treatment of PDACs and possibly other KRas-driven human cancers. Cancer Res; 72(17);

Introduction
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has 5-year survival rates less than 5% (1). Current frontline treatment for
advanced PDAC, gemcitabine, was introduced 13 years ago
with only incremental progress made thereafter (2, 3). Thus,
there is a need to develop new and less toxic therapeutic
approaches that can be rapidly introduced into the clinic. In
this regard, 90% of PDACs possess oncogenic mutations within
the gene KRAS, which renders the encoded small GTPase
constitutively GTP-bound and active (4). Oncogenic KRas can
convert normal human ductal pancreatic epithelial cells to a
tumorigenic state (5), and pancreatic expression of the activated oncogene leads to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasm
(PanIN) lesions that progress to PDAC in mice (6). Conversely,

silencing oncogenic Ras in established tumors causes spontaneous regression (7). KRas is thus the initiating oncogene in
PDAC, and like chronic myelogenous leukemia is addicted to
BCR-Abl and hence sensitive to imatinib (8), pancreatic cancers required oncogenic KRas for continued growth.
Despite the pivotal role of oncogenic KRas in PDACs, it has
proved challenging to inhibit (9). KRas exerts its tumorigenic
functions by activating primarily 3 effector proteins, Raf
kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), and Ral guanine
nucleotide exchange factors. Pharmacologic inhibitors of the
ﬁrst 2 pathways reduce tumor growth in some cancers, with
numerous clinical trials underway (4). As such, targeting
druggable components of oncogenic KRas signaling is one
potential strategy to treat PDAC.
Of the 3 KRas effectors, only active PI3K, or its principal
target AKT kinases, maintains xenograft tumor growth upon
silencing oncogenic Ras (10), suggesting that pancreatic cancer
cells become addicted to PI3K/AKT signaling. Consequently,
components of this pathway represent attractive targets. While
the families of PI3K and AKT proteins are druggable, they are
composed of highly related proteins involved in a large number
of normal physiologic processes, and general inhibitors of
these kinases can be toxic (11). However, the AKT substrate
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS, NOS3, or NOS
III; ref. 12) has been detected in the active state in human
PDAC tissues (13). eNOS is a member of the NOS family
additionally composed of neuronal NOS (nNOS, NOS1, or
NOS I) and inducible NOS (iNOS, NOS2, or NOS II) that generate
nitric oxide (12). Unlike AKT, eNOS plays a limited role in
normal physiology, mainly in vasorelaxation (14), and eNOS/
mice are viable (15). Moreover, mounting evidence suggests
that inhibition of eNOS has antitumor effects. Speciﬁcally,
eNOS/ mice are resistant to 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene

Targeting eNOS in Pancreatic Cancer

(DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-l3-acetate (TPA) chemical carcinogenesis (13) and platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF)-induced gliomagenesis (16), whereas peptide-mediated inhibition of eNOS decreases tumor vascular permeability and tumor growth in hepatocarcinoma and lung
carcinoma xenograft models (17). With regard to PDAC,
short hairpin RNA knockdown of eNOS reduces tumor
growth of 2 PDAC cell lines with highly phosphorylated
eNOS (13). Thus, inhibiting eNOS may be a way to indirectly
exploit the reliance of pancreatic cancer cells on oncogenic
KRas for tumorigenesis. In this regard, the NOS inhibitor NGnitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), which is moderately
selective for eNOS and nNOS over iNOS (12), was developed
and clinically evaluated in phase II trials for cardiogenic (18)
and septic (19–21) shock, and in numerous other clinical
trials, including those involving normal healthy subjects (22).
This drug is relatively benign compared with conventional
cytotoxic chemotherapy; the major side effect of chronic
administration is hypertension (23). These ﬁndings support
the possibility that eNOS could be targeted by repurposing
the drug L-NAME to treat PDACs. However, nitric oxide can
both inhibit and enhance tumorigenesis (24), and the effect
of ablating the eNOS gene on PDAC was unknown. Even if
genetic ablation of eNOS inhibited PDACs, it was unknown
whether this could be translated into a clinically relevant
approach using a small-molecule NOS inhibitor. We thus
evaluated the impact of genetically and pharmacologically
inhibiting eNOS on PDAC.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
AsPC-1, CAPAN-1, CFPac-1, HPAC, HPAF-II, MiaPaCa-2,
PANC-1, and SW-1990 (purchased from American Type Culture Collection) were not independently authenticated. Tumor
tissue from KPC mice was minced in collagenase V (SigmaAldrich) for 30 minutes at 37 C, after which cells were cultured
in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Media (DMEM) þ 10%FBS for 4
passages.
Mouse pancreatic cancer models
Pdx-1-Cretg/þ(6); eNOSþ/(15) mice were interbred with
LSL-KrasG12D (25); eNOSþ/ to generate eNOSþ/þ and
eNOS/ KC (LSL-KrasG12D/þ; Pdx-1-Cretg/þ) littermates. KPC
[LSL-KrasG12D/þ; Pdx-1-Cretg/þ; LSL-Trp53R172H/þ; ref. (26)]
mice were generated in a similar manner except the ﬁnal
step consisted of crossing littermates that were either eNOS
wild-type or null. KC and KPC mice were randomly assigned
to received water untreated or treated with 1 g/L L-NAME
(Sigma-Aldrich; ref. 27) after weaning until endpoints (330  7
days of age or at moribundity endpoints), according to a Duke
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee–approved
protocol.
Xenograft assays
Cells (107) suspended in 100 mL of Matrigel (BD Biosciences)
were injected subcutaneously into ﬂanks of severe combined
immunodeﬁcient (SCID)/beige mice (Charles River) and

www.aacrjournals.org

resultant tumors measured 3 times weekly (28). Mice were
treated with 1 g/L L-NAME (see above) beginning on the day of
xenograft injection, or once tumors reached a size of 0.75 cm3,
with 120 mg/kg (intraperitoneally) gemcitabine (Eli Lilly) twice
weekly for 2 weeks once tumors reached a size of 0.75 cm3, or
with 10 mg/kg (intraperitoneally) amlodipine (Sigma) 5 times
weekly as previously described (29), beginning on the day of
xenograft injection. Equal volumes of PBS were injected in
control mice.
Human PDAC tissue samples
Resected archived primary PDAC specimens were provided
for eNOS immunohistochemical analysis devoid of all identifying information, in accordance with Institutional Review
Board protocols.
Grading of ductal lesions
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained histologic sections
were reviewed by 2 pathologists (M.J. Shealy and D.M. Cardona)
blinded to the experimental groups. Examined slides consisted
of a single longitudinal section of pancreas (head to tail) with
adjacent small intestine and spleen from each mouse. Quantiﬁcation of mouse PanIN lesions was accomplished by ﬁrst
determining the total number of anatomic pancreatic lobules
per specimen. Lobules were counted and subsequently evaluated if they contained at least a single identiﬁable duct and
surrounding circumscribed pancreatic acini and/or ﬁbrosis.
Within each lobule, the highest grade mouse PanIN lesion
(normal, 1A, 1B, 2, or 3) was identiﬁed (30). Quantiﬁcation of
normal acinar area was determined in a blinded fashion from
typically 5 randomly identiﬁed high-power ﬁelds from 15 or
more pancreatic sections and expressed as a percentage of the
total area.
Mouse squamous papilloma and carcinoma analysis
Vulvar papillomas were excised from KC mice at time of
necropsy and weighed. Total number of new facial papillomas
arising until endpoints were determined for each mouse.
eNOS immunohistochemistry
Heat-induced epitope retrieval was conducted on H&Estained sections followed by staining with an a-eNOS (1:70,
Assay Designs 905-386) antibody (Vectastain Elite ABC kits,
Vector Labs, were used for peroxidase-based detection). Photographs taken from the areas of the strongest immunoreactivity
were qualitatively assessed within the vessels (internal control), duct epithelium, stroma, pancreatic acini, and adenocarcinom using a 4-tier scale (0–3þ) in a blinded fashion by a
pathologist (D.M. Cardona).
CD31 immunohistochemistry
Heat-induced epitope retrieval was conducted on H&Estained sections followed by staining with an aCD31 (1:100
Abcam ab2864 or 1:50 BD Pharmingen 550274) antibody (Vectastain Elite ABC kits, Vector Labs, were used for peroxidasebased detection). Usually 5 random high-power ﬁeld images of
pancreatic sections from 6 eNOSþ/þ and 5 eNOS/ KPC mice
each at moribundity endpoints were analyzed using ImageJ

software to quantitate pixels of CD31 reactivity per ﬁeld and an
average calculated.
Ki67 immunohistochemistry
Heat-induced epitope retrieval was conducted on H&Estained sections followed by staining with an aKi67 (1:50 Dako
M7249) antibody (Vectastain Elite ABC kits, Vector Labs, were
used for peroxidase-based detection). Ki67 immunoreactive
cells were counted from 4 to 5 random high-power ﬁeld images
of CFPac-1 xenograft tumor sections from 7 tumors each from
mice treated or untreated with 1 g/L L-NAME and an average
calculated.
PCR of KRas alleles
DNA, puriﬁed from pancreatic, facial papilloma, or vulvar
tumor tissue, was PCR ampliﬁed to detect wild-type and
recombined KRas alleles, as described previously (31).
Reverse transcription PCR of eNOS mRNA
RNA was puriﬁed from pancreatic tissue or tumor cell lines
established from pancreatic tumors of KC or KPC mice in the
absence or presence of the eNOS gene using the RNABee
reagent (TelTest), then reverse transcribed using the Omniscript RT Kit (Qiagen) and PCR ampliﬁed with the primers 50 TCTTCCATCAAGAGATGGTCAA-30 and 50 -TCATACTCATCCATGCACAGG-30 to detect eNOS and 50 -GCACAGTCAAGGCCGAGAAT-30 and 50 -GCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAA-30 to
detect glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
Blood pressure measurements
The average daily cohort blood pressure was determined by
averaging the average of the last 10 of 15 blood pressure
measurements from each conscious mouse in the cohort using
a computerized tail cuff monitor (Hatteras Industries) as
previously described (32). Average daily blood pressure was
calculated from measurements taken on 26 days over an
8-week span.
eNOS and HRas activation status
CFPac-1 cells transfected with 6 mg pCMV-neo-HA-eNOS
using Fugene 6 (Roche) were treated for 2 hours with dimethyl
sulfoxide or 20 mmol/L LY294002 (Cell Signaling Technologies).
These cells, KPC cell lines grown overnight in 0.5% fetal calf
serum, or subcutaneous tumors derived from CFPac-1 cells in
cohorts of mice untreated or treated with L-NAME were lysed
in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer, and resolved
by SDS-PAGE and probed using aAKT, aSer1177 PhosphoeNOS or aSer473 Phospho-AKT (Cell Signaling Technology) or
aHRas (Santa Cruz) antibodies. GTP-bound HRas was
detected as previously described (13). Quantitation of phospho-eNOS and HRas-GTP levels was done using ImageJ software. Results were normalized to total AKT and total HRas
levels, respectively.
L-NAME

dose titration
Twenty-four hours after HPAF-II, PANC-1, or CAPAN-2
cells were plated (4,000 cells per well), cells were treated
with 2 mL L-NAME in an 11-point dilution standard curve

4474

Cancer Res; 72(17) September 1, 2012

with concentrations ranging from 10 mmol/L diluted 1:3
down to 0.2 nmol/L then 24 hours later assayed with the
Cell Titer-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega).
Luminescence was detected with an Analyst HT Luminometer and graphed in a dose–response curve to calculate
pIC50 values.
Statistical analyses
For 2 cohort xenograft studies, tumor volumes of untreated and treated mice on the ﬁnal day of the experiment were
compared using a 2-sided unpaired t test. For xenograft
studies with multiple arms, 1-way ANOVA was used with a
Tukey multiple comparison test. For comparison of individual arms in blood pressure studies, for comparison of
individual arms in studies analyzing the area of normal
acinar tissue remaining in KC pancreata, for studies comparing relative CD31 and Ki67 immunoreactivity in tumors,
and for comparison of facial papilloma appearances in the
mice, a 2-sided unpaired t test was again used. For comparison of vulvar papillomas, the Mann–Whitney U test was
conducted. For analysis of normal ducts and PanIN-1A
lesions, c2 analysis was conducted to compare each arm
with control untreated mice. Ducts were grouped into 2
groups (e.g., normal vs. abnormal or PanIN-1A vs. all other)
and c2 analysis was conducted. Kaplan–Meier survival
curves were generated for each of the KPC mice cohorts,
and P values were calculated using the log-rank (Mantel–
Cox) test. All statistical analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism v5 (GraphPad Software).

Results
eNOS expression during PDAC development
LSL-KrasG12D/þ; Pdx-1-Cretg/þ (KC) mice conditionally
express endogenous mutant KrasG12D in the pancreas develop PanINs, presumed precursors to invasive disease that at
low frequency progress to PDACs (6). LSL-KrasG12D/þ; LSLTrp53R172H/þ; Pdx-1-Cretg/þ (KPC) mice conditionally express
endogenous mutant KrasG12D and p53R172H in the pancreas,
which leads to lethal PDACs similar to human PDAC (33, 34).
Capitalizing on the ability to model different stages of pancreatic cancer in mice, we measured eNOS levels by immunohistochemistry in the pancreas of 2 wild-type, KC, and KPC
animals. As previously reported (35), eNOS was conﬁned to
endothelial cells in the normal pancreas (þ2 to þ3 staining
in a scale of 0–þ3), with no visible staining in ducts or acini.
Variable eNOS reactivity (0–þ2) was observed in PanIN
lesions in KC mice. Patchy (þ2) to a widespread blush (þ1)
with focal eNOS staining was detected in adenocarcinomas of
KPC mice, which was lost in eNOS/ KPC mice (Fig. 1A). eNOS
was detected at variable levels by reverse transcription PCR
in 3 normal pancreatic tissue samples, presumably from the
endothelial cells, in all 4 pancreatic samples from KC mice,
and 11 of 13 pancreatic samples from KPC mice at the time
these tissues developed PanIN or adenocarcinomas. Eight of
the 13 tumor cell lines devoid of stromal tissue that were derived from pancreata of KPC mice also expressed eNOS. As a
negative control, eNOS was not detected in the pancreata
analyzed from 1 normal, 4 KC, or 1 KPC eNOS/ mice

Targeting eNOS in Pancreatic Cancer

pancreatic tumorigenesis. A and B,
eNOS protein (A) and mRNA (B), as
detected by immunohistochemical
staining and semiquantitative RTPCR, in the pancreata of normal (e.g.,
G12D/þ
mice that lack PdxLSL-Kras
Cre), KC (330 days of age), KPC, or
eNOS/ KPC mouse (at the
mortality endpoint). C, cancer cell
line derived from the matched tumor;
T, pancreatic tumor tissue.

(Fig. 1B). In humans, eNOS was previously shown to be
elevated, particularly in the vasculature, in pancreatic cancer
cell lines and specimens (36), and a number of human PDAC
cell lines exhibit activated eNOS (13). In agreement, 4 of 9
human pancreatic cancer specimens had regions of eNOS
positivity (e.g., Supplementary Fig. S1).
Genetic ablation of eNOS decreases PanIN development
To test whether ablation of the eNOS gene disrupts the onset
of pancreatic tumorigenesis, KC and eNOS/ KC mice were
aged to approximately 330 days to allow a spectrum of PanINs
to develop (6). Pancreata were removed, stained, and the area
of remaining normal acinar tissue quantiﬁed from usually 5
high-power ﬁelds per pancreas from cohorts of 12 to 16 mice
(amounting to 80 random high-power ﬁelds analyzed) as well
as the highest grade ductal PanIN lesion per lobule scored from
more than 2,600 lobules per group.
As previously reported (6), most of the pancreata in KC
animals were replaced with abnormal tissue consisting of
varying grades of PanIN lesions with abundant surrounding
ﬁbrotic stroma and associated chronic inﬂammatory cells
(Fig. 2A). Quantiﬁcation revealed that the average area of
normal acinar tissue remaining was reduced to 17% (Fig.
2B), with 94.5% of lobules having abnormal ducts, mainly
consisting of low-grade PanIN-1A lesions (Fig. 2C). eNOS/
KC mice exhibited over twice as much normal pancreatic
tissue area (P < 0.001, Fig. 2A and B), a signiﬁcant (P < 0.05)
drop in lobules with PanIN-1A lesions, and an accompanying

www.aacrjournals.org

signiﬁcant (P < 0.0001) doubling in the number of lobules with
normal ducts (Fig. 2C).
Genetic ablation of eNOS decreases development of other
oncogenic KRas–driven tumors
KC mice develop vulvar and facial papillomas (Fig. 3A and B)
presumably because of a recombined oncogenic KrasG12D allele
(Fig. 3C) arising from Pdx-1–restricted Cre expression (6,
37, 38). eNOS/ KC mice exhibited a signiﬁcant (P < 0.05)
50% decrease in the number of facial papillomas and a significant (P < 0.05) 85% decrease in the weight of vulvar papillomas
per mouse at the time of sacriﬁce (330 days) compared with
KC mice (Fig. 3D).
Genetic ablation of eNOS trends toward an increase in the
lifespan of mice with lethal PDAC
To test whether genetic ablation of eNOS provides a survival
beneﬁt, the most clinically relevant endpoint, eNOS-null alleles
were crossed into the KPC background, and littermates generated over the course of a year were used to populate cohorts
of 35 KPC and 32 eNOS/ KPC mice. Mice were euthanized at
moribundity endpoints known to immediately precede death
(33). Consistent with previous studies, KPC mice had a median
survival of 142 days (33), whereas eNOS/ KPC mice exhibited
a median survival of 176 days, a trend that although did not
reach signiﬁcance [P ¼ 0.093; HR, 0.709; 95% conﬁdence
interval (CI), ¼ 0.431–1.167], corresponded to an increase of
34 days or nearly 25% of the control lifespan (Fig. 4A).

L-NAME treatment decreases development of preinvasive

pancreatic lesions
To test whether pharmacologic inhibition of eNOS impacts
pancreatic cancer, KC mice were treated with L-NAME. This
drug was chosen because it has a 10-fold preference for eNOS
and nNOS over iNOS (12), can be orally dosed, a quality that
would facilitate administration in the clinic, is one of only 2 NOS
inhibitors to have been brought to a phase II clinical trial for the
treatment of shock (18–21), and appears to be a relatively benign
drug, with the main side effect of chronic administration being
hypertension and resultant end-organ damage, such as left
ventricular hypertrophy and glomerulosclerosis (23), all of which
can be suppressed by co-administration of antihypertensives
(39). A cohort of 16 KC mice was provided with L-NAME-treated
water at a dose established to increase blood pressure, indicating effective eNOS inhibition (see below and ref. 15) at weaning
until the termination of the experiment (330 days of age). The
L-NAME-treated group trended, although did not reach significance, toward retaining more normal tissue architecture than
untreated controls, with the mean percentage of remaining
normal acinar tissue increasing to 20.5% in 16 mice analyzed

(Fig. 2A and B), exhibited a signiﬁcant (P < 0.0001) decrease
in lobules with PanIN-1A lesions and a nearly 2-fold signiﬁcant
(P < 0.0001) increase in lobules with normal ducts in 12 mice
analyzed (Fig. 2C). Anecdotally, mice progressing to invasive
PDAC were also reduced, with 3 untreated, 2 eNOS/, and 1
L-NAME–treated KC mice developing PDACs.
L-NAME treatment can inhibit other oncogenic KRas–
driven tumors
L-NAME treatment signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) halved the number of facial papillomas and trended, but did not reach significance, toward an almost three-quarters reduction in the
weight of vulvar papillomas in KC mice (Fig. 3D).
L-NAME treatment trends toward an increase the lifespan

To address whether L-NAME increases survival in a PDAC
setting, 32 KPC mice treated as above with L-NAME were
monitored for moribundity endpoints. All-cause mortality was
assessed to include any deaths that may be because of
adverse effects from the drug itself. Median survival for the

not reach signiﬁcance (P ¼ 0.208; HR, 0.725; 95% CI, 0.439–
1.196), reﬂected a 19-day survival advantage over untreated
KPC mice (Fig. 4A). Whereas this effect could be ascribed to an
initial decrease in PanIN lesions, as observed in KC mice
treated with L-NAME (Fig. 2), L-NAME could similarly inhibit
the adenocarcinomas directly. Indeed, the ﬁnal tumor volume
of a PDAC cell line established from a KPC mouse was
signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) reduced in mice treated with L-NAME
(Fig. 4B).
L-NAME

treatment decreases tumorigenic growth of
human PDAC cell lines
To evaluate the potential of targeting NOS in a human cell
setting, an important consideration given that oncogenic Ras
signaling can exhibit species differences (28, 40), 8 KRAS
mutation–positive human PDAC cell lines were each injected
into 8 or more immunocompromised mice, of which half were

www.aacrjournals.org

untreated and half were treated with L-NAME. Five cell lines
showed a signiﬁcant response (P < 0.05), 2 lines trended toward
a response, and 1 did not respond to L-NAME, typically halving
the tumor size by the termination of the experiment (Fig. 5A
and Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2G). Anecdotally, the one
cell line not affected by L-NAME, PANC-1, was the only line

L-NAME, halved both subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft
tumor growth of the human PDAC cell line L3.6pl (41) and
aminoguanidine, a broad NOS inhibitor with some speciﬁcity
for iNOS, decreased tumor growth when given at high doses
(42).
To evaluate the effect of treating established human tumors,
once tumors from CFPac-1 cells reached a size of 0.75 cm3,
animals were left untreated or dosed with L-NAME. Within
days of beginning L-NAME treatments, tumor size was reduced
and at the termination of the experiment tumor size was

with the standard-of-care therapeutic gemcitabine (3), mice
with established tumors were also treated with gemcitabine or
a combination of gemcitabine and L-NAME. L-NAME treatments were as effective as gemcitabine at reducing tumor size,
but when combined did not provide any further reduction
(Fig. 5B).

treatment decreases PDAC tumor growth in

The primary effect of L-NAME is elevated blood pressure
(Fig. 5C; ref. 23). Acute L-NAME dosing variably causes transient hypertension in some, but not all healthy human subjects
(22). Chronic daily dosing of L-NAME over the course of 6 weeks
caused hypertension and resultant end-organ consequences in
rats (23, 39), although this was countered by a wide spectrum
of antihypertensives (39). Therefore, cohorts of 4 to 5 mice
injected with CFPac-1 cells were untreated or treated with the
antihypertensive amlodipine, L-NAME, or both drugs after
which 10 blood pressure measurements were taken a total of

eNOS promotes tumorigenesis through effects in the
tumor and stroma
KRas signaling can stimulate AKT (4), and AKT can phosphorylate S1177 and activate eNOS (14), which in turn can
elevate the level of activated GTP-bound wild-type HRas and
NRas to promote tumor growth (13). In agreement, the PI3K
inhibitor LY294002 reduced the level of activated aS1177
phosphorylated eNOS in CFPac-1 cells (Fig. 6A). Similarly, the
level of GTP-bound HRas, as detected by afﬁnity capture with
the Raf1 RBD followed by immunoblot with an aHRas antibody, was diminished in tumor cell lines devoid of stromal
tissue derived from the pancreas of 3 eNOS/ KPC mice
compared with tumor cell lines from 3 control KPC mice (Fig.
6B) and in 2 CFPac-1 derived tumors from mice treated with LNAME relative to tumors from 2 untreated mice (Fig. 6C).
Interestingly, L-NAME did not inhibit the in vitro proliferation
of 3 different human PDAC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3),
suggesting a role for eNOS in the tumor stroma as well. In this
regard, oncogenic Ras activates eNOS to maintain tumor
growth (13), and the ﬁrst effect observed upon silencing Ras
oncogene expression was an increase in apoptotic CD31þ cells
(43). Activation of Ras also leads to secretion of pro-angiogenic
cytokines (44, 45). Similarly, eNOS is known to play a role in
angiogenesis (46, 47). In this regard, CD31 staining from
typically 5 randomly chosen ﬁelds of PDAC tumors from 5
eNOS/ KPC mice compared with tumors from 6 control KPC
mice was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) reduced by one third (Fig. 6D),
and Ki67 immunoreactivity from 4 to 5 randomly chosen ﬁelds
from tumors arising in 7 mice injected with the CFPac-1
human pancreatic cancer cell line and treated with L-NAME
compared with tumors from 7 control untreated mice was
signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) reduced by half (Fig. 6E).

Discussion
Loss of eNOS or L-NAME treatment reduced the development of pancreatic lesions, facial papillomas, and vulvar
papillomas in the KC mouse model of preinvasive pancreatic
cancer. eNOS ablation and L-NAME treatment also trended, but
did not reach signiﬁcance, toward a 34- and 19-day increase in
survival in KPC mice, corresponding to a 25% and 13% increase
in lifespan compared with that of control KPC mice, respectively. In terms of human cell settings, eNOS was detected in
human PDAC samples, although admittedly this was a small
sample set, and L-NAME broadly inhibited the tumorigenic
growth of human PDAC cell lines. Given the variability in eNOS
levels detected in PDAC samples, we cannot rule out that the

more general inhibition of pancreatic tumorigenesis observed
in multiple animal model systems may be more limited in a
clinical setting. Similarly, given that L-NAME trended but did
not reach signiﬁcance toward a 19-day increase in survival in
the metastatic KPC mouse model, we also cannot rule out the
possibility that the drug may not be effective in the highly
aggressive late stage of the disease in humans. With these
caveats in mind, these data nevertheless suggest that eNOS is a
potential therapeutic target that could be inhibited with the
available drug L-NAME for the treatment of PDACs.
KC mice treated daily with L-NAME for roughly 10 months
had no overt adverse effects, and analysis of all-cause mortality
in KPC mice, which would take into account deaths because of
adverse drug events, was actually decreased in the L-NAME
treatment group compared with untreated controls. In fact, the
undesirable effects of L-NAME on blood pressure were ameliorated with a commonly used antihypertensive with no
change to the antitumor activity of L-NAME. Indeed, L-NAME
has been used in many clinical trials, including those involving
normal human subjects (22), suggesting that this drug may
have low toxicities in a cancer setting.
Because eNOS knockout and L-NAME treatments exhibited
similar effects on tumorigenesis in KC and KPC mice, and
because L-NAME inhibits eNOS in vivo, as measured by an
increase in blood pressure, the antitumor effects of L-NAME
can be attributed, at least in part, to eNOS inhibition. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that this may also be
a consequence of inhibiting other NOS isoforms. Similarly, the
cell type sensitive to eNOS inhibition during the development
of pancreatic cancer remains to be determined. NO can be
produced both by tumor and stromal cells (24). In regard to the
tumor, eNOS is detected in PDAC tumor cells (Fig. 1A), loss

www.aacrjournals.org

of the gene reduced the level of GTP-bound wild-type HRas
(Fig. 6B), and knockdown of eNOS in 2 pancreatic cancer cell
lines reduced their tumorigenic potential (13). In regard to the
stroma, L-NAME did not decrease the viability of pancreatic
cancer cell lines in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S3). Moreover,
both Ras and eNOS promote angiogenesis (44–47), eNOS/
animals are deﬁcient in endothelial progenitor cell mobilization and neovascularization (48), and CD31 and Ki67 staining
were reduced upon inhibiting eNOS (Fig. 6D and E). Thus,
activation of stromal eNOS, perhaps by paracrine signaling
from the tumor or other sources, may also promote tumorigenesis, for example, through effects on angiogenesis. An
orthotopic model of pancreatic cancer would help resolve the
issue of which tissue eNOS functions, and additionally, in the
context of human cells. Regardless of the source of eNOS, the
net result of genetic ablation and/or pharmacologic inhibition
of eNOS in the tested pancreatic cancer models was a reduction in tumorigenesis.
The inhibition of eNOS may have therapeutic use in malignancies beyond pancreatic cancer as oncogenic KRas–driven
vulvar and facial papillomas responded to L-NAME treatment
and exhibited reduced tumor growth in an eNOS/ background. This effect may extend even beyond KRAS mutationpositive cancers. Speciﬁcally, eNOS/ mice are also resistant
to DMBA/TPA chemical carcinogenesis (13) and were recently
reported to have prolonged survival in a PDGF-induced glioma
mouse model (16). Similarly, peptide-mediated inhibition of
eNOS decreases tumor vascular permeability and tumor
growth in hepatocarcinoma and lung carcinoma xenograft
models (17). Finally, eNOS-generated NO can regulate recruitment of pericytes and stabilization of angiogenic vessels in a
xenograft model of murine melanoma (49). Thus, we suggest
