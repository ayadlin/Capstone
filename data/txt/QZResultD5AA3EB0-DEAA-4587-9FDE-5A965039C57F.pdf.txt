Abstract
Autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) transplantation is the treatment of choice for selected
myeloma patients. However, tumor cells contaminating the apheresis product are a potential source of
relapse. Here we report a sequential purging strategy targeting mature and immature clonogenic myeloma
cell populations in the autograft. Thawed PBPC products of myeloma patients were treated with rituximab to
kill CD13820þ B cells (highly clonogenic immature cells), and bortezomib to target CD138þ cells (normal
and differentiated myeloma plasma cells), followed by coculture with allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells
(MSC) from normal donors. After 7 days of coculture, nonadherent cells were removed and cultured in the
absence of MSC for an additional 7 days. Then, efficacy of purging (removal of CD13820þ and CD138þ cells)
was assessed by flow cytometry and PCR. We used our ex vivo purging strategy to treat frozen aphereses from
16 patients. CD138þ and CD13820þ(19þ) cells present in the initial products were depleted more than 3 and
4 logs, respectively based on 106 flow-acquisition events, and to levels below the limit of detection by PCR. In
contrast, total nucleated cell (TNC), CD34þ cell, and colony-forming cell numbers were increased by
approximately 12 to 20, 8-, and 23-fold, respectively. Overall, ex vivo treatment of apheresis products with
rituximab, bortezomib, and coculture with normal donor MSC depleted mature and immature myeloma cells
from clinical aphereses while expanding the normal hematopoietic progenitor cell compartment. Cancer Res;

Introduction
High-dose chemotherapy (HDC) with autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) support is widely considered an effective therapy for selected patients with myeloma
(1–2). However, tumor relapse constitutes the single most
important cause of treatment failure. Relapse may result
from insufficient eradication of residual disease by HDC
and/or reinfusion of myeloma tumor cells with the PBPC
autograft. While the consequence of reinfusing malignant
cells remains unclear, one prospective study has suggested

that the presence of myeloma cells in PBPC grafts correlates
with poor outcome after transplantation (3). However, a
different study seems to contradict these observations (4).
Separate retrospective analyses of the European and North
American transplant registries have shown that patients
who received HDC followed by infusion of PBPC from a
twin presented fewer relapses and improved event-free
survival (EFS) compared with matched patients who
received an autograft (5–6). These observations suggest that
the higher relapse rate seen after autologous transplantation
may be due to, at least in part, the presence of reinfused
malignant cells. Thus, purging myeloma cells present in
autologous PBPC products represents a valid strategy aiming at reducing relapses.
Previous randomized clinical trials targeting the CD34
antigen, which is expressed by normal progenitors but not
by most myeloma cells (7), did not improve outcome after
transplant, despite reducing myeloma contamination of the
transplanted product by up to 3 logs (8–9). The negative
results of these trials are perhaps consistent with observations
that CD34þ cells in the blood of myeloma patients carry
disease-specific IgH VDJ gene rearrangements (10).

Novel Purging of Myeloma Autograft Products

The failure of CD34þ selection to effectively purge tumor
cells shows the need for the development of new purging
strategies, specifically ones that target relevant tumor cells.
CD138 is expressed by normal and differentiated myeloma
plasma cells. The proteosome inhibitor bortezomib can be
used to kill cells that express CD138 (11–12). However, a
separate myeloma population that does not express CD138
exists. It is a highly clonogenic immature cell population
with a CD13820þ(19þ) phenotype and an extensive ability
to replicate and generate differentiated progeny expressing
CD138þ (13–16). These CD13820þ(19þ) tumor cells are
effectively killed by the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab
(13). Thus, bortezomib and rituximab provide the ability
to purge both mature and immature clonogenic tumor
populations. In addition to the use of these agents, our
group (and others) has previously showed that a period of
ex vivo culture can selectively deplete tumor cells in autografts for chronic myelogenous leukemia (17–19). The loss of
normal primitive hematopoietic progenitors in the autograft
associated with ex vivo culture and differentiation can be
overcome by coculture with normal allogeneic donor
mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) (20). Such coculture conditions not only deplete tumor cells, but preserve, and in most
cases increase the numbers of normal hematopoietic progenitors present in the graft providing a potentially better
product for subsequent transplantation.
Therefore, we hypothesized that a purging strategy for
PBPC products from patients with myeloma that used a
combination of rituximab and bortezomib and a period of
ex vivo coculture with MSC might prove effective by killing
mature CD138þ and immature CD13820þ myeloma cells
while preserving (and possibly increasing) the content of
normal hematopoietic progenitors. Here we report the development of this multistep strategy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Myeloma cell lines RPMI-8226, ARP-1, and NCI-H929 were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured at 37 C, 5% CO2 in air, fully humidified atmosphere in
RPMI medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS
(Hyclone).
Initial treatment of peripheral blood progenitor cell
products
Cryopreserved PBPC products were obtained from G-CSFmobilized normal donors (N ¼ 4) and myeloma patients (N ¼
16) in accordance with a University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved protocol. All
patients and donors gave their informed consent for these
experiments.
Myeloma PBPC products were thawed in the presence of a
DNAse to reduce aggregate formation (55 U/mL Benzonase,
EMD Chemicals, Inc.) and washed in CliniMACS buffer
(Miltenyi Biotech) containing 0.5% human serum albumin
(Baxter Healthcare) and DNAse to reduce aggregate formation
(50 mg/mL Dornase ALFA Pulmozyme, Genentech, Inc.).

www.aacrjournals.org

Mononuclear cells were isolated by density separation
(Histopaque-1077, Sigma).
In initial experiments, CD138þ cells were removed from the
PBPC by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) according to
the manufacturer's instructions using the MidiMACS device
and CliniMACS CD138 MicroBeads (both Miltenyi Biotech).
CD138þ cells were used as a positive control for flow cytometry. The CD138 depleted PBPC cells were cultured overnight in CellGro SCGM medium (CellGenix) containing 10%
(v/v) FBS prior to use (Fig. 1). Later experiments were carried
out without CD138þ cell removal to show that this step was
not required for effective tumor cell purging.
For initial optimization experiments requiring normal
CD34þ cells, apheresis products from normal donors were
subjected to CD34 selection by MACS using the MidiMACS
device according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi
Biotech) and CliniMACS CD34 Reagent (Miltenyi Biotech).
Isolated CD34þ cells were cultured overnight in CellGro SCGM
medium containing 10% (v/v) FBS.
Rituximab treatment of peripheral blood progenitor
cells from myeloma patients and normal donor CD34þ
cells
Rituximab (Genentech, Inc.) was used to treat CD138
depleted PBPC from myeloma patients and, for the purpose
of assessing toxicity against normal hematopoietic cells,
CD34þ cells from normal donors. Cells were incubated for
24 hours at 37 C, 5% CO2 in air, fully humidified atmosphere in
CellGro SCGM medium containing 10 or 20 mg/mL rituximab
with 10% human AB serum (Atlanta Biologicals) as a source of
complement (13).
Bortezomib treatment of myeloma cell lines, CD138
myeloma patient peripheral blood progenitor cells and
normal donor CD34þ cells
Bortezomib (Millenium Pharmaceuticals Inc.) was used to
treat myeloma cell lines (RPMI-8226, ARP-1, and NCI-H929),
CD138 depleted cells from the PBPC of myeloma patients and,
for the purpose of assessing toxicity against normal hematopoietic cells, CD34þ cells from normal donors. Cells were
treated with a range of concentrations of bortezomib (2.5–160
nmol/L) for 16 or 24 hours (12).
Combined rituximab and bortezomib treatment of
peripheral blood progenitor cells from myeloma
patients
Following single drug optimization studies, CD138 depleted
cells or total PBPC from myeloma patient samples were
incubated with 20 mg/mL rituximab in the presence of 10%
human AB serum (source of compliment) for 24 hours with
Bortezomib (20 nmol/L) added for the last 16 hours of
incubation.
Ex vivo culture conditions
After drug treatment, cells were washed and cocultured for
7 days at 37 C in a 5% CO2 in air, fully humidified atmosphere
with normal donor bone marrow-derived MSC(20) in "Ex Vivo
Expansion Medium" (EVEM): CellGro SCGM (CellGenix USA)

to liquid culture (i.e., culture without MSC) in EVEM and
incubated for an additional 7 days (14 days total). After 14
days, nonadherent cells were collected. TNC number was
determined, colony-forming cell (CFC) assay conducted and
the expression of CD138, CD20, CD19, and CD34 on the cells
determined by flow cytometry. Samples were also taken for
PCR analysis for comparison between pretreatment, posttreatment, and post–ex vivo culture samples (Fig. 1). Comparison was made with data from pretreatment, post-treatment,
and post–ex vivo culture samples.

anti-CD34 and FITC conjugated anti-CD45, (all BD Biosciences Pharmingen). Samples of CD138þ cells (product of
MACS CD138 depletion) were also stained and analyzed to
confirm that CD138þ cells would be clearly detected if present.

Novel Purging of Myeloma Autograft Products

A range of 0.5–1.0  106 events were acquired for each sample
using a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) as permitted by cell
number available. Data acquisition and analysis was carried
out using CELLQuest Pro software (Becton Dickinson). The
sensitivity of flow cytometry allows the detection of one
positive (tumor) event in 10,000 acquired events.
We evaluated the possibility that the failure to detect
CD20þ cells by the fluorescently-conjugated detection antibody might be incorrectly interpreted as cell killing and that
these data might be a consequence of rituximab blocking
access to the CD20 antigen by the detection antibody. To
directly address this issue, samples were also stained with
allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-CD19 (Becton Dickinson) (22–23).
PCR
Clonality assay. The QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used to extract DNA from 106 cell aliquots collected
at appropriate points throughout the purging procedure.
Comparison was made between with pretreatment, postCD138 depletion, post-treatment, and post–ex vivo culture
samples for the presence of amplified (tumor-associated)
sequences. B-cell clonality was determined using the IgH
Gene Clonality Assay or IGK Gene Clonality Assay kits
(InVivoScribe Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. These kits utilize oligonucleotide
primers and conditions developed and validated by the
BIOMED-2 consortium (24). PCR reactions were carried
out in a 50 ml total volume containing 45 ml of master
mix, 1.25 units AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied
Biosystems), and 5 ml of DNA at a concentration of 100 to 400
mg/mL. Samples were subjected to a 7-minute incubation at
95 C followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (95 C, 45 seconds), annealing (60 C, 45 seconds), and extension (72 C, 90
seconds). Each run included polyclonal, clonal, and no
template controls.
Capillary electrophoresis. One ml PCR product, 0.5 ml
ROX size standard, and 8.5 ml deionized formamide were
mixed according to the manufacture's instructions
(Applied Biosystems), heated at 95 C for 2 minutes and
placed on ice for at least 1 minute before electrokinetic
injection (20 seconds) into the ABI 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The size (units of fluorescence)
and positions of peaks on the electropherogram were
analyzed using GeneScan analysis software (Applied Biosystems).
Colony-forming cell assay
The number of CFC was assessed in unmanipulated PBPC
samples and after CD138 depletion, rituximab and bortezomib
drug treatment, and ex vivo expansion. Cells were plated at
3,000 to 10,000 cells in 1 mL of methylcellulose medium
containing hematopoietic growth factors (Methocult H4435,
Stem Cell Technologies Inc.) in duplicate 35 millimeter dishes
(Falcon). Cultures were incubated in a 37 C, 5% CO2 in air,
fully humidified atmosphere for a period of 2 weeks. Colonies
were scored using an inverted microscope as clusters of >50
translucent cells.

Results
Effect of bortezomib on myeloma cell lines and normal
CD34þ peripheral blood progenitor cells
The effect of bortezomib (2.5–160 nmol/L) was investigated
on RPMI-8226 and ARP-1 myeloma cell lines (Fig. 2A and 2B)
and on normal CD34þ isolated from 3 healthy donor PBPC
(Fig. 2C). A 24-hour incubation with bortezomib at 80 nmol/L
induced 80% to 90% growth inhibition in the myeloma cell
lines (Fig. 2A and B), however, and it also markedly inhibited
(80%) the growth of normal CD34þ cells (Fig. 2C).
In contrast, a lower dose of bortezomib (20 nmol/L) for 16
hours was sufficient to induce 70% to 90% growth inhibition in
myeloma cell lines, with only 20% growth inhibition in normal
CD34þ cells. Because of the efficacy of a 20 nmol/L bortezomib
dose for 16 hours against the myeloma cell lines and minimal
impact against normal CD34þ cells, this dose was adopted for
further combination drug strategies.
Effect of rituximab on myeloma peripheral blood
progenitor cells and normal CD34þ cells
Rituximab has previously been shown to inhibit the
growth of clonogenic CD20 þ myeloma cells in vitro at 10
mg/mL (13). We studied the effect of rituximab at 5, 10, and
20 mg/mL on CD20þ myeloma cells from patient PBPC by
flow cytometry and on hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers (CFU–GM) from CD34þ cells isolated from normal
donor PBPC. A 24-hour incubation with rituximab at 20 mg/
mL was shown to be effective against CD20þ myeloma cells
(Fig. 2D) with only minimal toxicity against normal hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) (Fig. 2E). This dose and
time was therefore chosen for subsequent combination
drug strategies.
The use of a CD19 detection antibody confirmed that
CD20þ(19þ) cells were indeed killed by rituximab (Fig. 3C).
This addresses any argument that the failure to detect CD20þ
cells might not be indicative of cell death, rather it may simply
be a consequence of rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) stereochemically blocking access of the CD20 detection antibody to
the CD20 antigen.
Efficacy of bortezomib alone, rituximab alone, and
bortezomib and rituximab in combination on
peripheral blood progenitor cell products from
myeloma patients
Bortezomib (20 nmol/L, 16 hours) effectively depleted
CD138þ cells with no effect on CD20þ(19þ) cells (Fig 3A
and B). Rituximab killed CD20þ(19þ) cells, but not CD138þ
cells (Fig. 3C). The combination of rituximab (20 mg/mL, 24
hrs) and bortezomib (20 nmol/L, during the last 16 hours of
incubation) was effective at killing both CD138þ and
CD20þ(19þ) cells present in the PBPC (Fig. 3D).
Building on the efficacy of combination drug treatment
with ex vivo culture
The efficacy of a tumor-purging procedure that consisted
of MACS CD138þ depletion followed by treatment with a

eradicates CD20þ(19þ) (immature myeloma) cells (C). The combination of bortezomib and rituximab eradicates both CD138þ (mature myeloma) and

Figure 4. Efficacy of CD138þ cell depletion, treatment with rituximab and bortezomib, and ex vivo culture at depleting tumor in myeloma patient PBPC
product. A. Representative flow cytometric data revealed that a thawed myeloma patient PBPC product contained 1.1% CD138þ cells (A(i) top)
and 11.0% CD138CD20þ(19þ) cells [A(i) bottom]. MACS CD138þ depletion reduced the CD138þ cell content of the PBPC from 1.1% to 0.3%
(A(ii) top). Combination treatment with rituximab and bortezomib further reduced the CD138þ cell content of the PBPC to from 0.3% to 0.0% (A(iii) top)
and reduced the CD138CD20þ(19þ) cell content of the PBPC from 8.8% to 0.1% [A(iii) bottom]. After ex vivo culture, the CD138þ ((iv) top) and
CD138CD20þ(19þ) cell (A(iv) bottom) content of the PBPC was 0.0%. B. Representative data show a unique clonal peak (indicative of cells expressing a
unique immunoglobulin rearrangement and which provides a surrogate marker for tumor cells) at 278 base pairs (indicated by arrow). Tumor cells are
detected by PCR in the original PBPC product [B(A)], after MACS CD138þ cell depletion B(B) and after combined rituximab and bortezomib treatment B(C).
Only after ex vivo culture is the signal associated with tumor absent B(D). It should be noted that the range of the y-axis in B(D) has been changed from 0 to 8000

reduced to levels below the limit of detection by flow
cytometry (< 1:10,000) [Fig. 4A(iv)] and PCR [Fig. 4B(D)]. Thus,
from the original PBPC input, an overall >3-log depletion of
CD138þ and >4-log depletion of CD13820þ(19þ) tumor cells
can be estimated.

Figure 5. Impact of purging on TNC, CD34þ cell, and CFC numbers.
Attempts were made to optimize purging conditions to those that yielded
maximal antitumor impact with minimal impact on normal hematopoietic
progenitors. MACS depletion of CD138þ cells and treatment with
bortezomib and rituximab was responsible for an approximately 50%,
60%, and 43% reduction in TNC, CD34þ cell, and CFC numbers,
respectively from those originally input (5A and B). After the 14-day period
of ex vivo culture an approximately 20, 8- and 23-fold increase,
respectively in TNC, CD34þ cell, and CFC numbers from those originally
input was observed. (Data as mean  SEM, n ¼ 12, *P < 0.05).

Impact of purging on normal hematopoietic progenitor
cells
With the efficacy of this purging strategy against tumor cells
confirmed both by FACS (Fig 4A) and PCR (Fig 4B), the impact
of the process on normal HPC was also investigated. Although
MACS depletion of CD138þ cells and treatment with bortezomib and rituximab was responsible for an approximately
50%, 60%, and 43% reduction in TNC, CD34þ, and CFC
numbers, respectively from those originally input, the 14day period of ex vivo culture was responsible for an approximately 20-, 8-, and 23-fold increase in TNC, CD34þ, and CFC
numbers from those originally input (Fig 5A and B).
Magnetic activated cell-sorting depletion of CD138þ
cells does not improve efficacy of purging
With the shown efficacy of bortezomib against the CD138þ
cells and with the goal of simplifying the purging procedure
and facilitating its clinical application, we removed the MACS
CD138þ cell depletion step. To this end, 4 myeloma PBPC were
treated with bortezomib and rituximab without prior CD138þ

MACS depletion to determine the efficacy of this approach.
Further, in these 4 cases, the myeloma patients had been
previously treated with bortezomib, allowing us to better
mimic the clinical situation where the majority of myeloma
patients will have received bortezomib as standard of care.
The removal of the CD138þ MACS depletion step did not
impact the efficacy of the tumor purging achieved as shown by
representative flow cytometric (Fig. 6A–C) and PCR data
(Fig. 6D–F). Although an approximate 50% and 30% reduction
in TNC and CD34þ numbers, respectively, was still observed
after treatment with bortezomib and rituximab (in the
absence of the MAC depletion), the subsequent 14-day period
of ex vivo culture produced an approximate 12- and 8-fold
increase in TNC and CD34þ numbers, respectively, from those
originally input (Fig. 7).

Cancer Res; 71(14) July 15, 2011

Our results indicate that incubation of PBPC products of
myeloma patients with rituximab and bortezomib followed by
a period of ex vivo culture markedly depletes CD138þ and
CD13820þ cell populations. CD138þ and CD13820þ(19þ)
cells present in the initial products were depleted by more
than 3 and 4 logs, respectively, based on 106 flow-acquisition
events and to levels below the limit of detection by PCR,
reflecting an effective purging of mature and immature myeloma tumor cells. Further, in the same PBPC samples the
numbers of normal HPC as measured by TNC, CD34þ cell, and
colony-forming cell numbers were increased by approximately
12 to 20-, 8-, and 23-fold, respectively.
Bortezomib and rituximab are important elements of our
purging strategy. Bortezomib has been previously reported
to inhibit CD138þ mature myeloma cells in vitro (13, 25). In
keeping with these data, we have shown that the use of
bortezomib markedly depletes the mature CD138þ myeloma
cell population from apheresis products. However, bortezomib has little effect on CD13820þ(19þ) immature myeloma
precursors. This may be consequence of multidrug resistance, which is characteristic of a more primitive cell
phenotype (25). Rituximab has therefore been used to target
this immature myeloma tumor cell precursor.(13, 25) In
keeping with these data, we have shown that the use of
rituximab markedly depletes the immature CD13820þ(19þ)
myeloma cell population from the apheresis products of
patients with myeloma.
Whereas it has been reported that myeloma cells exhibit
high mortality in culture (26), ex vivo culture in the presence of
hematopoietic growth factors has also been shown to not only
maintain, but expand the numbers of normal HPC without
supporting tumor cells (17, 27). Our data confirm and build on
these observations. Confirming these reports, our results
indicate that ex vivo culture with MSC further depleted
myeloma cells while reconstituting, and even increasing,
normal HPC by 8-fold. The first week of ex vivo culture was
carried out in the presence of growth factors and MSC. It is
thought that MSC positively impact HPC expansion by providing cellular and extracellular components of the microenvironmental stem cell niche and the complex molecular

Figure 6. MACS depletion of CD138þ cells is not required for effective purging. Flow cytometric (A–C) and PCR analyses (D–F) reveal that
indicators of myeloma (CD138þ and CD13820þ19þ cells for flow cytometry and the presence of the Ig Kappa light chain for PCR) were reduced to
levels below those detectable by either technique after the purging procedure. The treatment of PBPC with bortezomib and rituximab followed by
ex vivo culture was itself sufficient to eradicate tumor cells from the PBPC without the use of CD138þ MACS depletion. It should be noted that the range
of the y-axis in (F) was changed from 0 to 8000 arbitrary units (used in D–E) to 0 to 4000 arbitrary units which, although increasing the background "noise"
present, further emphasizes the absence of any signal associated with the presence of tumor cells.

cues that direct hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation (28–31).
The availability of normal allogeneic MSC (predisposed
to support normal hematopoiesis) rather than having to
use autologous MSC derived from the myeloma patient for
the coculture step may be an important benefit. MSC from
myeloma patients present a distinct genetic and phenotypic profile that seems to favor the survival and proliferation
of myeloma cells. As such they might be predisposed to
support the survival and proliferation of myeloma cells
during coculture, The use of normal MSC might be, at least
in part, responsible for the continued purging of tumor
cells and support of normal HPC observed in our procedure
(32–37).
In addition, our experiments show that the MACS CD138þ
cell depletion, first thought to be an important component of
the purging process, does not contribute substantially to its
efficacy. The removal of the MACS CD138þ depletion step will
facilitate the clinical development of our purging procedure.

www.aacrjournals.org

We appreciate that these data need to be interpreted with
caution. First, while most of the CD138þ plasma cells detectable in the bone marrow of myeloma patients are malignant (as
opposed to earlier stages of the myeloma transformation
process; ref. 38), we did not carry out multiparametric flow
cytometry. This might reveal disease-specific aberrant phenotypes and allow differentiation between tumor and normal
plasma cells present in these patients (39). Therefore, while the
eradication of the CD138þ population by the use of bortezomib
markedly depletes the malignant plasma cells, it also likely
depletes the small number of normal plasma cells present. Any
adverse impact of such a depletion on post-transplant immunity might only be ascertained in a clinical trial.
Second, while the purging process seemed to successfully
deplete mature and immature components of the disease, it is
possible that tumor cells were still present in the end product,
albeit at levels below the levels of detection of flow cytometry
and PCR. Evidence for potential residual tumor might only
become apparent during in vivo studies. While an in vivo

mouse model is currently in development, it might ultimately
fall to a clinical trial to address this concern.
In conclusion, our sequential purging strategy, including
rituximab and bortezomib treatment followed by ex vivo
culture, seems to effectively deplete mature and immature
myeloma cells present in PBPC from myeloma patients.
Further, in addition to effective tumor purging, another
benefit of this procedure is the expansion of normal HPC.
This we hypothesize will provide a tumor-free graft with a high
hematopoietic reserve, which should ultimately carry out well
in a transplant setting. A clinical trial is planned to determine
the safety of this purging strategy in myeloma patients.

respectively in TNC and CD34þ numbers in the PBPC (consistent with data
