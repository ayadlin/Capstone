ABSTRACT
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) controls cell survival,
growth, migration, and invasion. Here, we observed that STAT3 exerted anti-apoptotic
effects in breast cancer cells. On the other hand, miR-17-5p induced apoptosis in
breast cancer cells, and overexpression of miR-17-5p sensitized MCF-7 cells to
paclitaxel-induced apoptosis via STAT3. Overexpression of STAT3 in MCF-7 cells
decreased paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, but STAT3 knockout abolished the miR-17-5pinduced increases in apoptosis. Finally, miR-17-5p promoted apoptosis by increasing
p53 expression, which was inhibited by STAT3. These results demonstrate a novel
pathway via which miR-17-5p inhibits STAT3 and increases p53 expression to promote
apoptosis in breast cancer cells.

demonstrated that miRNAs play important roles in
human cancer [6–10], and miR-17-5p is particularly
important in breast cancer. Specifically, the miR-17-5p
cluster acts as a tumor suppressor by directly inhibiting
the expression of AIB1 and cyclin D1 in human breast
cancer [11, 12]. Yu et al. demonstrated that the miR17-5p cluster mediates migration and invasion in breast
cancer cells by affecting the secretion of a heterotypic
signal [13]. MiR-17-5p also suppresses MDA-MB-231
cell migration and invasion by inhibiting HBP1 [14,
15]. In addition, miR-17/20 regulates p53 and inhibits
Akt, in turn mediating breast cancer cell apoptosis
[16], and miR-17*92 increases apoptosis by inhibiting
the transition of pro-B into pre-B [17]. The onset
and progression of breast cancer involves apoptotic
signals that are stimulated by miRNAs [17]. Here we
investigated the role of miR-17-5p, which may repress
the translation of the STAT3 oncogene, in the control of
breast cancer cell apoptosis.

INTRODUCTION
Signal transducer and activator of transcription
3 (STAT3) is an important transcription factor [1]. In
response to interferon, cytokines, and growth factors,
Janus kinases (JAK) phosphorylate STAT3, which then
forms homo- or heterodimers that translocate to the cell
nucleus and mediate the expression of a variety of genes;
STAT3 thus plays a key role in many cellular processes,
including cell survival, growth, and apoptosis [2]-5].
Furthermore, STAT3 can act as a tumor suppressor or an
oncogenic agent; for example, STAT3 suppresses brain
tumor progression via PTEN and promotes progression in
various breast cancer types [3, 4].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (approximately
22 nt) regulatory RNAs that base pair with the 3’
untranslated region (3’UTR) of target genes, ultimately
resulting in the degradation of target mRNAs or
inhibition of their translation [5]. Several studies have

in both control and miR-17-5p-transfected MCF-7 cells
after treatment with 15 μM tamoxifen for 36 and 24 hours,
respectively, compared to untreated cells (Figure 2D).
Furthermore, survival was lower in miR-17-5p-transfected
cells at both the 24 and 36 hour timepoints than in control
MCF-7 cells after tamoxifen treatment (Figure 2D).

MiR-17-5p sensitized breast cancer cells to stress
signal-induced apoptosis
Our previous studies demonstrated that miR-175p suppressed proliferation in MCF-7 breast cancer cells
[18]. To determine the mechanism by which miR-17-5p
regulates breast cancer cell apoptosis, MCF-7 cells and
MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with miR-17-5p
mimics or negative control (NC). The cells were then
treated with 0.1 μM paclitaxel or Taxol for 48 hours and
the TUNEL assay was used to analyze cell apoptosis.
Transfection of miR-17-5p mimics increased numbers of
apoptotic cells in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells
compared to control cells; this increase was greatest in
the MCF-7 cells (Figure 1A). Thus, miR-17-5p strongly
increased the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to Taxol-induced
DNA damage.
Next, we performed western blots to measure the
expression of target genes (p53, p21Cip1/Waf1, p27Kip1, and
p57Kip2) in apoptosis-regulating pathways. P53, p21Cip1/Waf1,
and p27Kip1 expression increased in miR-17-5p-transfected
MCF-7 cells. P57Kip2 expression was unchanged by miR17-5p treatment (Figure 1B and 1C). Taxol treatment
enhanced the miR-17-5p-induced increase in p53
expression (Figure 1D and 1E). Similarly, expression of
the apoptosis gene Bax and cleavage of the PARP and
caspase 3 genes increased in MCF-7 cells transfected
with miR-17-5p mimics (Figure 1F and 1G). These
observations indicate that miR-17-5p sensitized breast
cancer cells to stress signal-induced apoptosis.

MiR-17-5p attenuated Taxol resistance in MCF-7
cells
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells treated with
different concentrations (0-500 nM) of Taxol for 48 hours
or 72 hours were used for quantitative analysis of cell
survival. Survival decreased in miR-17-5p-transfected
MCF-7 cells compared to control cells after treatment
with 400 or 500 nM Taxol (Figure 3A and 3B). Survival
also decreased in miR-17-5p-transfected cells (~29% vs.
~39%) after treatment with Taxol for 72 hours (Figure 3B).
MiR-17-5p overexpression reduced the IC50 for Taxol
after 48 hours of treatment in MCF-7 cells, and survival
decreased in miR-17-5p-transfected MDA-MB-231 cells
after 72 hours of treatment with 500 nM Taxol (Figure
3E). In contrast, miR-17-5p did not affect the sensitivity
of MDA-MB-231 cells to 48 hours of Taxol treatment
(Figure 3D). Cell growth curves revealed that sensitivity to
500 nM Taxol increased in miR-17-5p-transfected MCF7 cells after 24 hours (Figure 3C). Furthermore, while
transfection of miR-17-5p also increased the sensitivity
of MDA-MCB-231 cells to 24 hours of treatment with
500 nM Taxol, this effect was weaker than that observed
in miR-17-5p-transfected MCF-7 cells in response to the
same treatment (Figure 3F). Taken together, these data
indicate that miR-17-5p attenuated resistance to Taxol in
breast cancer cell lines.

MiR-17-5p sensitized MCF-7 cells to tamoxifen

STAT3 is required for miR-17-5p-induced
sensitization of breast tumor cells to Taxolinduced apoptosis

Tamoxifen resistance is common in estrogenreceptor α (ERα)-positive breast cancer cells, including
MCF-7 cells [16]. MiR-17-5p-transfected and control
MCF-7 cells were treated with 15 μM tamoxifen for up to
36 hours. MiR-17-5p-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells
was associated with the induction of Bax and PARP and
with cleavage of PARP; tamoxifen enhanced this effect
(Figure 2A). Similarly, an ELISA revealed that miR-17-5p
induced cytochrome c (Cyto C) and caspase 3 expression
in MCF-7 cells, and tamoxifen treatment enhanced this
effect (Figure 2B). MiR-17-5p mimics-transfected and
negative control (NC) MCF-7 cells were then treated
with 15 μM tamoxifen for up to 36 hours, and a TUNEL
assay was conducted to analyze cell apoptosis. Apoptotic
cell numbers increased in miR-17-5p mimics-transfected
MCF-7 cells compared to control cells (Figure 2C).
Importantly, transfection of miR-17-5p mimics sensitized
MCF-7 cells to tamoxifen-induced apoptosis (Figure 2C).
The SRB assay was used to test relative cell survival.
Overexpression of miR-17-5p attenuated cell survival in
the presence of tamoxifen (Figure 2D). Survival decreased

STAT3 inhibits apoptosis by upregulating the
transcription of anti-apoptotic genes [19], and JAK2/
STAT3 signaling regulates p53 activation [20]. In addition,
miR-17 and miR-20a inhibit the expression of p21Cip1/Waf1
and STAT3 [21]. To investigate whether STAT3 is
involved in miR-17-5p-induced sensitization to cellular
apoptosis, we constructed MCF-7 cells with either stable
STAT3 knockout or overexpression to assess the role of
STAT3 in miR-17-5p mediated apoptosis. These MCF-7
cell lines were transfected with either miR-17-5p mimics
or NC. Apoptosis rates were higher in control MCF-7 cells
after Taxol treatment than in STAT3-overexpressing MCF7 (Figure 4A).
MiR-17-5p transduction sensitized STAT3overexpressing MCF-7 cells to Taxol treatment (Figure
4B and 4C). Notably, p53 expression was much higher
in STAT3-knockout MCF-7 cells than in control MCF-7

cells (Figure 4E). Interestingly, expression of STAT5, but
not STAT1, was detected in STAT3-knockout MCF-7 cells
compared to control MCF-7 cells (Figure 4D). Western
blots showed that miR-17-5p overexpression enhanced
p53 expression in STAT3-overexpressing MCF-7 cells
compared to control MCF-7 cells (Figure 4F).
It has been reported that p53, which is a tumor
suppressor, causes cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in
response to DNA damage [22]. Low concentrations of
paclitaxel induce p53 and p21 expression and cytotoxic
G1/G2 arrest in specific cell types [23, 24]. P53 knockout
in MCF-7 cells inhibited p21Cip1/Waf1 and cleaved caspase

3 expression compared to control MCF-7 cells (Figure
4G). Interestingly, western blot data showed that
miR-17-5p increased cleaved caspase 3 expression
in p53-knockout MCF-7 cells compared to control
MCF-7 cells; p53 knockout did not affect p21Cip1/Waf1
expression (Figure 4H).

MiR-17-5p directly targeted STAT3 to inhibit its
expression in MCF-7 cells
To further explore the role of STAT3 in miR-17-5pinduced sensitization to cellular apoptosis, we examined

the effects of miR-17-5p on STAT3 expression. Two
putative miR-17-5p target sites were identified in the
STAT3 3’-UTR using TargetScan Release 6.2 software
(Figure 5A), indicating that STAT3 is a potential target
of miR-17-5p. These target sites in the Homo sapiens
STAT3 3’-UTR are shown in Figure 5B. To determine

whether STAT3 is a direct target of miR-17-5p, reporter
vectors containing either the wild-type full-length 3′-UTR
(WT-UTR) or the mutant miR-17-5p binding sites were
constructed (Figure 5C and 5D). MiR-17-5p reduced the
activity of the STAT3 WT-UTR luciferase plasmid by up
to 60%, but had no effect on the activity of the STAT3

mut-UTR luciferase plasmid (Figure 5E). Together,
these results indicate that miR-17-5p inhibited STAT3
expression by directly targeting STAT3.
To confirm that miR-17-5p directly targets STAT3,
miR-17-5p mimics or anti-miR-17 and the corresponding
NC were transfected into MCF-7 cells. MiR-17-5p
transfection decreased STAT3 protein levels (Figure 5F
and 5H), and anti-miR-17 reversed the miR-17-5p-induced
inhibition of STAT3 expression (Figure 5G and 5H).
These results confirmed that miR-17-5p inhibited STAT3
expression in MCF-7 cells.

cancer cells [18, 19, 23]. Specifically, miR-17-5p acts as
a tumor suppressor by inhibiting cell proliferation in a
cell-type-specific manner [18–24]. Active STAT3 controls
critical cellular functions, including cell proliferation and
differentiation, survival and self-renewal, and apoptosis
[25]. The miR-17/92 cluster is a STAT3 target [26], and
STAT3-mediated induction of miR-17 expression in
particular can confer resistance to MEK inhibitors [27].
These studies provide new insights into the mechanisms
by which miRNAs mediate breast cancer cell apoptosis.
Here, we report that miR-17-5p-induced sensitization of
breast cancer cells to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis requires
STAT3.
Tamoxifen exerts its cytotoxic effects primarily
through cytostasis, which induces cell cycle arrest at the
G0/G1 phase [37]. Tamoxifen also induces apoptotic
activity, which involves the cleavage of caspase 3, caspase
7, caspase 9, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP)
[28, 29]. Importantly, the ER-negative MDA-MB-231,
MDA-MB-453, and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell
lines are sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of tamoxifen
[29], and a previous study demonstrated that miR-17/20
enhanced tamoxifen-induced, ERα-mediated apoptosis
[30]. This is consistent with our results, which indicate
that miR-17-5p increases the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to
tamoxifen (Figure 2).
Paclitaxel (Taxol), a microtubule-targeting agent,
can induce G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [31] and
inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-468, MDAMB-231, and MCF-7 cell lines [32]. Taxol attenuates renal

STAT3 and pSTAT3 expression are elevated,
while miR-17-5p expression is decreased, in
breast cancer tissue
Since miR-17-5p plays an important role in breast
cancer cell apoptosis, we measured miR-17-5p expression
in human breast tissues. Compared to normal breast
tissue, miR-17-5p expression was lower in breast cancer
tissue (Figure 6A). Western blots confirmed that STAT3
and pSTAT3 expression were higher in breast cancer
tissue than in normal breast tissue (Figure 6B). These
clinical data also indicate that the miR-17-5p-STAT3 axis
contributes to the development of breast cancer.

DISCUSSION
Previous studies have demonstrated that miR-17/20
controls proliferation and induces apoptosis in breast

interstitial fibroblast activation and interstitial fibrosis by
inhibiting STAT3 signaling [33]. Our data indicate that
miR-17-5p sensitizes MCF-7 breast cancer cells to Taxolinduced apoptosis (Figure 1) and STAT3 is required for
this sensitization (Figure 4).
MiR-17-92 inhibits cell proliferation, promotes
apoptosis, and induces tumor angiogenesis [7, 17, 34].
P21Cip1/Waf1 is a well-characterized target of miR-17/92
family members, with a 3’ untranslated region (UTR)
that is directly regulated by the miR-17/miR-20/mir106 family [35]. MiR-17-92 overexpression promotes
proliferation by inhibiting the expression of p21Cip1/Waf1,
a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and p53-inducible
gene [36]. STAT3 has been shown to bind to the STATbinding sites (SIE) in the p21Cip1/Waf1 promoter, thereby
enhancing p21Cip1/Waf1 expression [37]. MiR-17 and miR20a directly inhibit p21Cip1/Waf1 and STAT3 expression;
conversely, overexpression of both p21Cip1/Waf1 and STAT3
reverses miR-17/miR-20a-mediated abrogation of HIF-1αinduced differentiation [21]. P57Kip2 is another confirmed
miR-17/92 target, and its 3’-UTR harbors binding sites for
miR-92 [38]. This may explain why miR-17-5p increased
p53, p21Cip1/Waf1, and p27Kip1 expression, but did not affect
p57Kip2 (Figure 1B) or p21Cip1/Waf1 expression, in stable p53knockout MCF-7 cells (Figure 4H). MiR-17/20 dampens
the reciprocal activation of E2F by c-myc by inhibiting
E2F translation [39]. MiR-17-5p also inhibits the ERα
coactivator AIB1 in breast cancer cells [12]. Rbl2, an
Rb family member, is also a target of miR-17-5p [11].
In addition, miR-17/20 targets the cyclin D1 3’-UTR in
MCF-7 breast cancer cells, resulting in cell cycle arrest
and suppression of cell proliferation [11]. Furthermore,
miR-17/20 overexpression reduces overall tissue growth
in transgenic mice [40]. Here, we found that miR-175p induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells (Figure 1A)
and increased the expression of p53, Bax, Cyto C, PARP,
and caspase 3, which are key components of the p53mediated apoptosis pathway (Figure 1D, 2A and 2B).
Together, these data suggest that the miR-17/20 cluster
may function as a breast tumor suppressor by regulating
the expression of genes related to cell apoptosis and cell
cycle progression.
STAT3, which is constitutively activated in a variety
of human tumors, possesses oncogenic potential and antiapoptotic activities [41, 42]. STAT3 promotes oncogenesis
by upregulating the anti-apoptosis genes Bcl-xL, Bcl2,
Mcl-1, survivin, and c-Myc [43–46]. Furthermore, STAT3regulated miR-17 plays a critical role in MEK inhibitor
resistance, and inhibition of miR-17 sensitized resistant
cells to AZD6244 by inducing BIM and PARP cleavage
[27]. Furthermore, STAT3/miR-17-92 clusters form a
positive feedback loop that regulates proliferation of
retinoblastoma [16]. Previous studies have revealed that
the p53 protein, which acts upstream of p21Cip1/Waf1, is
induced in response to DNA damage [47]. In addition,
Taxol-induced p21Cip1/Waf1 and p53 [24, 48] regulate G1/
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

G2 arrest, while low concentrations of Taxol induce
mitotic arrest instead [23]. A specific interaction between
p53 and a p53-binding site in the proximal region of the
miR-17-92 promoter inhibits miR-17-82 expression [49].
A previous study demonstrated that STAT3 binds to the
promoter of the mouse p53 gene to inhibit its expression,
and blocking STAT3 up-regulates p53 expression, leading
to p53-mediated tumor cell apoptosis [50]. These findings
are consistent with the following observations from the
current study: miR-17-5p induced apoptosis in breast
cancer cells (Figure 1); p53 expression was much higher
in STAT3-knockout MCF-7 cells than in the control MCF7 cells (Figure 4E); miR-17-5p overexpression promoted
p53 expression in STAT3-overexpressing MCF-7 cells,
but not in control MCF-7 cells (Figure 4F); and miR-175p-induced sensitization of breast cancer cells to Taxolinduced apoptosis requires STAT3 (Figure 4).
In conclusion, our study demonstrated that miR17-5p directly targets STAT3 and induces apoptosis in
breast cancer cells by inhibiting the STAT3/p53 pathway.
These findings highlight the potential role of miR-17-5p
as a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for breast
cancer.

TUNEL assay
MiR-17-5p-transfected cells and control cells were
cultured in medium containing paclitaxel (0.1μM). After
24-48 hours, MCF-7 cells or MDA-MB-231 cells were
plated into a 96-well plate in triplicate. Apoptosis assays
were performed using the In Situ Cell Death Detection
Kit, TMR red (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)
following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Annex V staining
After treatment with Taxol or transfection with
miR-17-5p mimics, STAT3-expressing MCF-7 cells were
incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated Annexin V and
then stained with propidium iodide. Flow cytometry was
used to count apoptotic cells.

Sulphorhodamine B assay
The cytotoxicity of paclitaxel was determined using
the sulphorhodamine B (SRB) assay [19]. Cells were
plated at 3 × 103 cells/well in sextuplicate in 96-well
plates. The cells were then cultured overnight to allow
them to adhere, after which culture medium containing
different concentrations of paclitaxel was added. Cells
were harvested 0 (control) or 72 hours after treatment,
fixed with 10% Trichloroacetic acid for 1 hour at 4 °C, and
washed five times with water. The cells were then stained
with 0.4% SRB in 1% acetic acid for 30 min, washed five
times with 1 % acetic acid, and allowed to dry. 10 mM
Tris-base was added to dissolve SRB and absorbance was
measured with a plate reader at 530 nm. IC50 was defined
as the concentration that killed 50% of cells compared to
the untreated control.
