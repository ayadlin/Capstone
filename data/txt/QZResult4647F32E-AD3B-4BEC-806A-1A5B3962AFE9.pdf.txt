ABSTRACT
Thiopurines are widely used as anticancer and immunosuppressive agents.
However, life-threatening myelotoxicity has been noticed and largely explained by
genetic variations, including NUDT15 polymorphisms (e.g., rs116855232). In this study,
we conduct a meta-analysis to investigate the impact of rs116855232 on thiopurinesinduced myelotoxicity susceptibility (1752 patients from 7 independent cohorts), as
well as on thiopurines intolerance dose (2745 patients from 13 cohorts). Variant allele
of rs116855232 contributes 7.86-fold (P < 0.00001, 95% CI: 6.13–10.08) higher risk to
develop leucopenia with high specificity (91.74%) and sensitivity (43.19%), and lower
thiopurines intolerance dose (P < 0.00001). Through bioinformatics prediction, amino
acid changes induced by genetic variants are considered to reduce the stability, and
break an α helix of NUDT15, which is part of the thiopurine binding pocket. Additionally,
we conduct an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis for NUDT15, and find
a promoter-located eQTL signal (rs554405994), which may act as a potential marker
to predict thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity. In conclusion, genetic polymorphisms
in NUDT15 are strongly associated with adverse drug reaction (ADR) of thiopurines,
although more evidences are needed to determine values of all functional NUDT15
polymorphisms for clinical regimen, rs116855232 should be considered as a highly
credible pharmacogenetic indicator for thiopurines using espcially is Asians.

multiple sequential anabolic reactions [3, 4], which (e.g.,
deoxythioguanosine triphosphate) can incorporate into
double-stranded DNA to trigger futile mismatch repair
and lead multiple types of cells (e.g., T lymphocytes) to
apoptosis and subsequent resolution of inflammation [5–8].
Meanwhile, 6-MP and its metabolites can be methylated
by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and interrupt
intervening  DNA  synthesis [9, 10]. Therefore, TPMT
activity has been noticed to be negatively related to
6-TGN content in plasma [11].
Large interindividual variations in dose responses
and ADR susceptibility has been noticed due to the narrow
therapeutic index of thiopurine drugs, with common
dose-dependent toxicities, including myelotoxicity and
hepatotoxicity [8, 12]. One well reported and accepted
explanation is that patients with TPMT deficiency
induced by genetic variants can increase sensitivity
to myelotoxicity effects of thiopurine drugs [13, 14].
Actually, several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
in TPMT gene (e.g., rs1142345) have been labeled as
pharmacogenetic markers, and strongly recommended
to be genotyped for clinic usage of thiopurines [15–18].
However, racial diversity of TPMT SNPs in terms of
variant allele frequencies limits their prediction values. For
example, rs1142345, which is the most common TPMT
SNP (also indicated as TPMT*3C), has allele frequency
of 4% in Caucasians, but only 1.3% in East Asians.
Paradoxically, thiopurines-induced leukopenia is more
common in Asians, and quite a few patients with wildtype TPMT are intolerant to full dose of thiopurine drugs
[19, 20], suggesting the existence of other underlying race
specific genetic polymorphisms in thiopurine response.
Recently, two independent studies have identified a
variant in NUDT15 gene (i.e., rs116855232, inducing
p.Arg139Cys) to be associated with intolerance to
thiopurines or thiopurines-induced ADR in patients with
ALL and IBD, respectively [2, 12]. Such association
has been replicated by multiple independent studies
[14, 21–28], and expanded to several other NUDT15
SNPs, including rs147390019 (inducing p.Arg139His)
[24]. Large genetic population studies (e.g., ExAC project)
demonstrate that variant allele of rs116855232 of NUDT15
is most common in East Asians (10.4%) and Hispanics
(7.1%), rare in Europeans (0.46%), but barely detected
in Africans, while rs147390019 is mostly in Hispanic
(1.75%) [29], contributing to ancestry-related differences
in thiopurine drugs tolerance [12, 19, 30].
NUDT15 is deemed to dephosphorylate the
thiopurine active metabolites TGTP and TdGTP,
preventing their incorporation into DNA and negatively
affecting the cytotoxic effects of thiopurines [2, 3, 14,
21–24, 28, 31–33]. Crystal structure of NUDT15 has been
characterized, making it possible to estimate the impact
of Arg139Cys and Arg139His on NUDT15 activity, and
subsequent cell sensitivity to thiopurine treatment. Indeed,
in vitro pharmacological analyses and cellular drug
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

response examinations have been done and determined
the NUDT15 deficiency induced by not only genetic
variants, but also the expression level of NUDT15 [24],
highlighting the importance of NUDT15 SNPs genotyping
for clinic use of thiopurine drugs.
In this study, we aim to conduct a systematic
review and meta-analysis to investigate the association
of NUDT15 SNPs with clinic thiopurine response on the
basis of existing researches, and examine the impact of
these common variants on NUDT15 structure through
bioinformatics analyses. Finally, eQTL analyses are
proceeded to search more pharmacogenetic markers for
thiopurine induced ADR in NUDT15 gene, in order to
increase the prediction sensitivity.

RESULTS
Meta-analyses
Through literature searching (see Methods), 20
independent cohort studies that demonstrated in 11 articles
met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis (Figure 1).
Characteristics of these studies were summarized in Table 1.
We conducted meta-analyses on association of rs116855232
with thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity susceptibility, as
well as thiopurines intolerance dose. First, 7 studies were
included with a total of 602 cases (patients with thiopurinesinduced myelotoxicity) and 1150 controls (patients without
myelotoxicity) for myelotoxicity susceptibility analysis.
Fixed effect model was used since no heterogeneity was
observed in the allele model (P = 0.68, and I2 = 0%).
Compared to C allele, variant T allele significantly exhibited
a 7.86-fold (OR = 7.86, 95% CI: [6.13, 10.08]) increased
risk to develop thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity in both
IBD and ALL (P < 0.00001, Figure 2). Totally, the presence
of rs116855232 variant allele had a sensitivity of 43.19%
(260/602) and specificity of 91.74% (1055/1150) for all
myelotoxicity events, while the specificity reached 84.59%
(1323/1564) for early myelotoxicity events (Supplementary
Tables 1 and 2). Additionally, Consistent association was
also observed in dominant model (P < 0.00001, OR = 9.48,
95% CI: [7.20, 12.47]), and recessive model (P < 0.00001,
OR = 18.10, 95% CI: [6.34, 51.68]). Secondly, 13 studies
assessed the association between rs116855232 and
thiopurines intolerance dose with a sample size of 2745.
Random model was employed in dosage maintenance
meta-analysis since the high heterogeneity among studies.
Compared to CC carriers (as reference group), T allele
carriers (CT and TT genotypes) required 28% (P < 0.00001,
95% CI: [–0.34, –0.21]) lower mean daily thiopurines
dose. Because thiopurine dosage used in ALL patients is
significantly higher than that in IBD patients, we separated
the patients into two groups in terms of disease types, and
found similar risk of thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity and
thiopurine maintenance dosage reduction rate for T allele
(Figure 3).

For both meta-analyses, we used Begg’s test and
Egger’s test to measure the publication bias for all model,
no evidence of obvious asymmetry was observed, such
as Figure 4. Sensitivity analyses were also carried out by
removing each study one at a time, the ORs remain stable,
suggesting that the conclusion of rs116855232 impact
on thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity susceptibility and
thiopurines intolerance dose were robust and reliable.

α-helix, may perturb the α-helix loop and the base of the
substrate binding pocket (Figure 5A, 5B, 5C). Additionally,
Arg139Cys could lead to the formation of a disulfide bond
with the adjacent cysteine residue (Cys140) that may
further reduce the enzyme activity of NUDT15 (Figure 5B).
However, Val18Ile mutant at the first β-sheet has less effect
on the protein structure. Subsequently, mutant energy
calculation showed similar results (data not shown). For
protein stability estimation, mutant energy of Arg139His
and Arg139Cys variants are greater than 0.5 kcal/mol,
largely decrease the protein stability compared to wildtype
and Val18Ile mutant, indicating the possible role of these
genetic variants on NUDT15 function (Figure 5D).

Crystal structure and protein stability prediction
Besides rs116855232, two additional functional
SNPs (i.e., rs186364861 [inducing Val18Ile], and
rs147390019 [inducing Arg139His]) were also reported
recently. To investigate the effect of the Val18Ile,
Arg139His and Arg139Cys mutants on the protein function
of NUDT15, we firstly constructed their mutant models
through mutating selected residue of the crystal structure,
and optimize the mutant region structure by using loop
refinement. Through bioinformatics prediction, we noticed
that Arg139His and Arg139Cys were located at the second

DISCUSSION

regulation of NUDT15 in cell lines can also sensitize
leukemia cells to thiopurines [24], we thus conducted an
eQTLs analyses for NUDT15 to search additional potential
pharmacogenetic markers in this gene. Expression level
and SNP genotypes of LCLs were retrieved from the public
resource (see Methods), and submitted for association
analyses. Only one SNP (rs554405994) achieved statistical
significance (P = 0.004) (Figure 6A), and LCLs from
Asians with variant allele are related to lower NUDT15
expression (Figure 6B). rs554405994 locates in the
promoter region of NUDT15, with a high GC content and
DNase I sensitivity. Multiple strong transcription factors
and H3K27Ac binding signal can be detected around this
rs554405994-located region according to the epigenomic
information from public resource (i.e., Epigenome
Browser [38], Figure 6C), indicating variant allele of
rs554405994 may be associated with NUDT15 expression
through altering the binding affinity of transcription
factors with gene promoter. Interestingly, rs554405994
also induces a GlyVal insertion between position 18 and
19 of NUDT15, and causes a slight reduction in NUDT15
activity according to the previous report [24]. Therefore,
rs554405994 can impact thiopurine metabolism through
both down-regulating gene expression and reducing
enzyme activity, thus may be considered as a new causal
variant for thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity.

Ethnic diversity in genetics is an important factor for
inherited predisposition to disease susceptibility, as well
as drug treatment outcomes [39, 40]. For instance, SNPs
at ARID5B locus are associated with ALL susceptibility
with varied odds radio among ethnicities [41, 42], while
missense SNP in CDKN2A exhibits significance only
in Caucasians [43]. 6-MP is commonly used in ALL
chemotherapy and can induce severe ADR events in some
patients (mainly myelotoxicity), which can be largely
explained by TPMT variants in Caucasians and blacks but
not Asians due to the low variant allele frequency [15, 29].
Recently, missense SNP (i.e., rs116855232) in NUDT15
has been linked to thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity in
ALL as well as IBD by genome-wide association studies
[2, 12]. Such association has been replicated in multiple
independent follow-up studies by considering either
myelotoxicity event or intolerance dose, and also exhibited
ethnic specific mainly because the risk allele frequency is
high in Asians and Hispanics (e.g., ~10% in Asians), but
rare in Caucasians (0.2%) and not detected in blacks [12].
Therefore, rs116855232 of NUDT15 testing is of greater
diagnostic value than TPMT genotyping for prospective
risk assessment of thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity in
Asian population.

In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to
estimate the impact of rs116855232 in NUDT15 on
thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity as well as thiopurine
intolerant. With allele model, T allele carriers have ~8fold higher risk compared to C allele carriers to develop
leucopenia no matter in ALL or IBD. However, patients
with CT genotype have a significant lower myelotoxicity
rate (229 out of 322, 71.10%) than TT genotype (31 out
of 33, 93.94%), thus lower risk to develop leucopenia
compared to CC genotype in additive model, with
OR = 7.60 (95% CI: 5.77–10.03) and 18.10 (95%
CI: 6.34–51.68), respectively. Moreover, the ADR rate

varied largely in patients with CT genotype range from
43.48% to 100% (median = 72.22%), probably due to the
starting dosage of thiopurines. Actually the incidence of
thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity will increase with the
higher standard dose (e.g., 35% vs. ~25% IBD patients
suffered ADR in Suk-Kyun’s study compared with others),
but the T allele frequency are similar within patients
with ADR among studies. However, statistical analysis
can’t be done due to the limited number of studies and
complicated study design. For meta-analysis for thiopurine
maintenance dose, high heterogeneity was observed in
both IBD and ALL studies, possibly induced by drug

response variations in patients with CT genotype as
described above. However, we didn’t use additive model
to estimate the contribution of TT genotype to thiopurine
intolerant compared to CC genotype, because 11 out of 13
studies have no more than one patient with TT genotype
of rs116855232. Overall, our results indicate the important
diagnostic value of rs116855232 in NUDT15, especially
patients with TT genotype. Moreover, Suk-Kyun Yang et
al demonstrated the significant higher diagnostic value of
rs116855232 as indicator for early (OR = 35.13) than late
leukopenia (OR = 5.29), with accordingly sensitivity of
89.40% (59/66) and 31.43% (88/280), respectively [2],
suggesting not only the strong effect of rs116855232 on
thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity, but also some other
factors may be involved in late myelotoxicity events.
Interestingly, additional SNPs in NUDT15 described by
Takaya et al are related to final maintenance thiopurines
dosage, including rs147390019 (only common in Hispanic
[1.7%]) and rs186364861 (only common in Asian
[1.6%]) [24]. Compound heterozygote of these SNPs
illustrated similar effect on thiopurines dosage adjustment
as homozygous variant of rs116855232, indicating more
attention should be paid for all functional NUDT15 SNPs.
However, meta-analysis is not applicable due to the

lack of independent studies for these SNPs. In addition,
interaction of TPMT and NUDT15 variants have also been
considered in some studies, heterozygous of functional
SNPs of both genes show significant lower intolerant
thiopurine dose than mono-heterozygous SNPs, but higher
than homozygous variants in either SNPs [24]. However,
more independent studies are needed for validation
because the sample size of patients with either compound
heterozygous of NUDT15 variants or heterozygous
genotype in both TMPT and NUDT15 is small.
According to the previous report, NUDT15 is a nudix
hydrolase which can degrade dGTP and dGDP in vitro,
suggesting that it may reduce the active metabolites
of thiopurine in vivo [44]. Indeed, loss-of-function of
NUDT15 enzymatic activity induced by amino acid change
of Arg139Cys (induced by rs116855232 risk allele), can
largely explain thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity and
thiopurines maintain dose. Other clinical relevant genetic
variants were also conducted to estimate their impact on
NUDT15 function. Interestingly, rs147390019 introduces
amino acid change at the same position as rs116855232,
resulting in Arg139His. As the crystal structure of
wildtype NUDT15 and the importance of the position
Arg139 in thiopurine has been characterized [45, 46], we

further figured out that both Arg139Cys and Arg139His
greatly impact on the crystal structure of NUDT15 by
breaking α-helix of the active domain and reducing the
stability of mutated NDUT15. However, it can’t explain
the effect of Val18Ile (induced by rs186364861) and
Val18_Val19insGlyVal (induced by rs554405994) since
little change has been seen in NUDT15 structure with
these altered amino acids (data not shown). Due to the
possibility of prediction error, experimental crystallization
and structure analysis for mutated NUDT15 is needed to
determine the impact of these SNPs. Additionally, Takaya
et al established stable cell lines and observed significant
increase of TGTP/TGMP ratio as well as DNA-TG content
in NUDT15 knockdown cells [24], raising a possibility that
eQTL for NUDT15 may also be related to clinical ADR
events. We thus conducted an eQTL analysis and screened
out the top eQTL signal (i.e., rs554405994), which is
predicted to be located at the promoter region with multiple
binding sites of regulatory factors. Interestingly, this SNP
has been described above as an inframe indel, inducing

two amino acids (GlyVal) insertion between position
18 and 19. Therefore, the risk allele of rs554405994 is
related to lower expression level and decreased enzyme
activity of NUDT15 [24], thus could be considered as
another pharmacogenetic marker for thiopurine response.
However, further clinical confirmation studies are needed
to determine the improved sensitivity for thiopurinesinduced myelotoxicity after considering rs554405994,
especially for the late ADR.
In conclusion, our meta-analysis demonstrates the
strong significant association of the SNP (rs116855232)
at NUDT15 with thiopurines-induced myelotoxicity
susceptibility and thiopurines intolerance dose in either
ALL or IBD. Although rs116855232 has already been
labeled as pharmacogenomics marker in PharmGKB
(www.pharmgkb.org), we considered the recommended
level could be upgrade from 1B to 1A for thiopurines
usage. Besides, more independent studies are needed to
estimate the impact other functional SNPs of NUDT15 to
guide the clinical usage of thiopurines.

Figure 5: Impact of rs116855232 on protein structure and stability structures are illustrated for (A) wildtype,
(B) Arg139Cys and (C) Arg139His for NUDT15, and subsequent protein stability has also been analyzed (D).

needed, because all the information was acquired from
published studies.

Literature and study acquisition

Data extraction and verification

Systematically literature searching was carried
out independently by two investigators from PubMed,
Google Scholar and the Chinese National Knowledge
Infrastructure (CNKI) date to July 27, 2016 according to
following search terms: “rs116855232”, or “NUDT15”, or
“thiopurine drugs” and “polymorphisms” and “NUDT15”,
or “thiopurines” and “NUDT15”, or “polymorphism”
and “NUDT15”. All papers were restricted to English
(N = 30). Initially, checking of the titles as well as the
abstracts was conducted to remove the duplicated articles
along with papers that did not meet our subject. Then, we
read through every remaining studies and retained valuable
papers which meet the following criteria: (1) thiopurine
drugs  therapy based toxicity studies; (2) association of
SNPs at NUDT15 with thiopurine drugs intolerance or
susceptibility to toxicity was evaluated; (3) information
of patient number was provided, including patients with
or without ADR, respectively; (4) provided the genotype
counts or sufficient data to impute the genotypes, (5) data
without overlap (N = 11). When multiple publications
reported on the same or overlapping data, only the
publication with the most updated or detailed data was
included. The literature screening flow presented in
Figure 1. Neither Ethical approval nor patient consent was

Using strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, detail
information was extracted from each publications,
including first author, ethnicity, sample size, and etc.
6-MP dose was converted to AZA equivalent dose using a
conversion factor of 2.08 [2], and Meeh-Rubner formula
was used to unify the units into mg/m2. Corresponding
authors were contacted with if datasets were not accessible
or incomplete for the required data. For accuracy, all the
information was double checked and reviewed by another
investigator. Detail information about the included papers
was listed in Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 3, 4 and 5.

Meta-analyses
By using Review Manager 5.3 software [34], we
intended to analyze the association of rs116855232
polymorphism with thiopurine induced leukopenia
susceptibility, or thiopurines intolerance dose, with allele
model (variant T allele vs. wildtype C allele), dominant
model (TT+TC vs.CC), and recessive model (TT vs.
TC+CC). Carriers of rs116855232 CC was defined as
a reference group in SNP genetic models, while CT
or TT was defined as “rs116855232 T carriers”. To

remove any heterogeneity caused by pharmacodynamic
differences in thiopurine drugs sensitivity among the
study populations, the thiopurine drugs maintenance
dose (mean ± SD) in each genotype (including CT, TT,
and T carriers, respectively) was normalized against the
reference group [35]. Heterogeneity among those studies
were evaluated by the Q statistic and the I2 statistic, of
which Q approximately follows a χ2 distribution with k-1
(k indicates the number of studies) degrees of freedom.
P value was used to detect the significance level of
heterogeneity. I2 = (Q-(k-1))/Q*100%, ranging from
0–100%. I2 was considered as a critical value, when
I2 < 50% and P > 0.1, fixed-effect model was used to
calculate summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence
interval (95% CI), while the random-effect model should be
employed under the circumstances of I2 > 50% and P < 0.1
because of high heterogeneity.

The initial three dimensional geometric coordinates
of the X-ray crystal structure of NUDT15 (PDB code:
5BON) were downloaded from the Protein Databank
(PDB). The Val18Ile, Arg139His and Arg139Cys mutant
models were constructed using the Build Mutants protocol
of Discovery Studio 3.5 (Accelrys Inc., USA). Disulfide
bridges of Arg139Cys mutant model was selected
manually. Loop refinement protocol, which uses a looper
algorithm to optimize the structure of a selected nonterminal loop region of a protein structure, was performed
to evaluate the protein structure change of the mutants.
Mutation energy (stability) was calculated using pHdependent mode to investigate the effect of single-point
mutations on protein stability.

Expression level of NUDT15 gene was obtained
from public RNA-seq data resource of Lymphoblastoid
cell lines for CHB/JPT (GSE11582) [36], and genotypes of
SNPs (Chr13: 48582000-48622000, hg19 human genome
version) around NUDT15 were obtained from the 1000
genome project website (http://browser.1000genomes.
org/). SNPs with variant allele detected in less than
three individuals were excluded. Genotype-expression
association was assessed through a linear regression model
for the available individuals (N = 447). Regional plots
were constructed by plotting the negative logarithm of the
P value for each SNP in a 11.2-kb window at the NUDT15
locus using LocusZoom [37].
