Abstract
Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC) frequently develop therapeutic resistance to taxane
chemotherapy and antiandrogens. Cabazitaxel is a second-line
taxane chemotherapeutic agent that provides additional survival
beneﬁts to patients with advanced disease. In this study, we
sought to identify the mechanism of action of combined cabazitaxel and androgen receptor (AR) targeting in preclinical models
of advanced prostate cancer. We found that cabazitaxel induced
mitotic spindle collapse and multinucleation by targeting the
microtubule depolymerizing kinesins and inhibiting AR. In
androgen-responsive tumors, treatment with the AR inhibitor,
enzalutamide, overcame resistance to cabazitaxel. Combination
treatment of human CRPC xenografts with cabazitaxel and enzalutamide reversed epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) to

mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) and led to multinucleation, while retaining nuclear AR. In a transgenic mouse model
of androgen-responsive prostate cancer, cabazitaxel treatment
induced MET, glandular redifferentiation, and AR nuclear localization that was inhibited by androgen deprivation. Collectively,
our preclinical studies demonstrate that prostate tumor resistance
to cabazitaxel can be overcome by antiandrogen-mediated EMTMET cycling in androgen-sensitive tumors but not in CRPC.
Moreover, AR splice variants may preclude patients with advanced
disease from responding to cabazitaxel chemotherapy and antiandrogen combination therapy. This evidence enables a signiﬁcant insight into therapeutic cross-resistance to taxane chemotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate
cancer. Cancer Res; 76(4); 912–26. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

AR splice variants, resistance develops and disease recurs (7–9).
Taxanes (docetaxel and cabazitaxel) are the mainstay of chemotherapy for metastatic CRPC patients who developed resistance to
antiandrogen therapy. First-generation taxanes, like docetaxel
(Taxotere), target the cytoskeleton by stabilizing the interaction
of b-tubulin subunits of microtubules preventing depolymerization, inducing G2–M arrest and apoptosis (10). Unliganded AR is
sequestered in the cytoplasm by the HSP90 supercomplex and
upon binding to the ligand, DHT, dimerizes and translocates to
the nucleus (11, 12). Nuclear AR binds androgen-responsive
elements of DNA and transcriptionally activates genes promoting
prostate cell growth (11). Taxanes bind to b-tubulin subunits of
microtubules, stabilizing their interaction and preventing depolymerization of the microtubule structure and leading to apoptosis (13, 14). Work by our group and others established that
docetaxel chemotherapy inhibits AR trafﬁcking and nuclear translocation, thus preventing its transcriptional activity (15–17).
Taxanes also upregulate forkhead box 01 (FOXO1), a transcriptional repressor of AR, resulting in the inhibition of liganddependent and -independent transcription and downregulation
of AR and prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) expression (18, 19).
The therapeutic impact of taxanes in mCRPC and improving
patient survival has been attributed to microtubule stabilization
and AR-targeting ADT (18, 20). Despite an initial efﬁcacy and a
survival advantage in patients with mCRPC, resistance to taxane
chemotherapy invariably develops, leading to disease progression
(21). Mechanisms implicated in the development of docetaxel
resistance include high afﬁnity of the drug for the P-glycoprotein

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been used as a
standard treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer
since the historic discovery by Charles Huggins 65 years ago (1).
All patients, however, ultimately develop castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC) with recurrence to lethal disease. Progression to metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) is characterized by aberrant
expression of the androgen receptor (AR), de novo intraprostatic
androgen production, and cross-talk between androgen signaling
with other oncogenic pathways (2, 3). Recent antiandrogen
therapies, such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, although
effectively target the androgen signaling axis (4–6), due to the
addiction of CRPC cells to ARsignaling and constitutively active

Cabazitaxel Reverses EMT in Prostate Cancer

drug efﬂux pump, mutational alterations in tubulin, and epithelial– mesenchymal transition (EMT; refs. 20–22). The FDA has
recently approved several promising agents including Jevtana
(cabazitaxel, Xtandi (enzalutamide, MDV3100), and Provenge
(sipleucel-T) providing additional survival beneﬁts to patients
with advanced disease (23, 24). Cabazitaxel is the second-line
taxane chemotherapy, with signiﬁcantly decreased afﬁnity for the
P-glycoprotein pump for increased cellular retention (14). The
nonsteroidal, antiandrogen enzalutamide (MDV3100) was rationally designed from the AR crystal structure (4, 24, 25). Functionally, MDV blocks androgen signaling by preventing binding
of AR to DHT, blocking AR translocation into the nucleus, and
inhibiting AR from binding to androgen-responsive elements on
DNA (12, 26). Recent clinical evidence suggests that the AR splice
variant V7 confers therapeutic resistance to enzalutamide in CRPC
patients (8, 9, 27).
The process of EMT, featuring characteristic phenotypic manifestations and driven by molecular programming, confers invasive, metastatic, and stem cell–like properties in epithelial-derived
tumors with acquired resistance to apoptosis (28–32). In this
study, we investigated the contribution of EMT to resistance to
cabazitaxel and antiandrogens in preclinical models of advanced
prostate cancer. Our ﬁndings indicate for the ﬁrst time that
cabazitaxel induces multinucleation by targeting kinesin expression and reverses EMT to mesenchymal–epithelial transition
(MET) in vitro and in vivo. Cabazitaxel also sustains nuclear AR,
conferring resistance that can be overcome by antiandrogens in
androgen-responsive tumors. In CRPC models harboring a cohort
of AR variants, combination treatment of cabazitaxel with antiandrogen promoted epithelial redifferentiation by activating
MET.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and transfections
Human prostate cancer cell lines, the androgen-independent
cell lines PC3 and DU145, the CRPC cancer cell line 22Rv1, and
the androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP
and VCaP were obtained from ATCC. Cell lines were obtained
every year between 2010 and 2014 and have been authenticated
and tested for mycoplasma in September 2011, June 2012, and
November 2013 by Q11 short tandem repeat (STR; method of
Masters and colleagues 2012: Authentication of human cell lines:
standardization of STR proﬁling; DDC Medical). PC3 AR variant
transfectants PC3v7, PCv12, and PC3v567es were generated in
this laboratory using plasmids provided by Drs. S. Plymate
(University of Washington, Seattle, WA) and J. Luo (Johns Hopkins Brady Urological Institute, Baltimore, MD). TGFb-responsive
LNCaPTbRII were generated and characterized in this laboratory
(33, 34). All cell lines, but VCaP cells, were maintained in
RPMI1640 (Invitrogen) and 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and
100 mg/mL streptomycin in a 5% CO2 incubator (37 C). The
VCaP cells were cultured in DMEM (ATCC). Cells were seeded in
10% CSS and stimulated by DHT (Sigma-Aldrich) or R1881 (1
nmol/L).
Drugs
Cabazitaxel (Jevtana) was generously provided by Sanoﬁ Aventis. For the in vivo administration, cabazitaxel was prepared by
mixing ethanol, polysorbate 80, and 5% (w/v) glucose in sterile
water (1:1:18). Solutions were administered intravenously as a

slow bolus. Cabazitaxel stock (500 mmol/L) was prepared in
100% ethanol and stored at 20 C. MDV3100 was purchased
from Selleck Chemicals. For in vivo administration in mice,
MDV3100 was prepared in DMSO, diluted with sterile PBS
(75% PBS and 25% cabazitaxel–DMSO solution), and injected
intraperitoneally.
Antibodies
The antibody against the AR (N-20) protein was purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against tubulin, Ncadherin, mitotic centromere–associated kinesin (MCAK; KIF2C),
HSET, CD31, and phospho-histone H3 (pH3) were obtained
from Abcam Cell Signaling; antibodies against cleaved caspase3, GAPDH, E-cadherin, and cytokeratin-18 proteins were
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. The ZEB1 antibody
was obtained from Bethyl Laboratories.
Western blot analysis
Total cellular protein was extracted from cell lysates by homogenization with RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technology); subcellular fractionation was performed using NE-PER nuclear-cytoplasmic fraction kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Protein samples were
loaded into 4% to 15% SDS–polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and
subjected to electrophoretic analysis and blotting. Membranes
were subsequently incubated with the Amersham ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (Amersham, GE Healthcare) and
auto-radiographed using X-ray ﬁlm (Denville Scientiﬁc). Protein
expression bands were normalized to GAPDH expression.
Cell viability assay
The effect of the various treatments on prostate cancer cell
viability was evaluated using the Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay. Cells were seeded into 24-well plates and
after grown to 60% to 75% conﬂuence, were treated with
vehicle control (VHC; DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich), cabazitaxel,
MDV3100, and combination in RPMI1640 with 10% CSS for
24 hours (or DMEM for VCaP). At the termination of exposure,
cells were aspirated and rinsed with PBS, then treated with 250
mL/well MTT (1 mg/mL) for 30 minutes at 37 C. Absorbance
was measured at 570 nm using mQuant Spectrophotometer
(Biotech Instruments Inc.).
Migration assays
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates, and at 65% to 70% density,
the cell monolayers were wounded. After 24 hours, the number of
migrating cells toward the center of the wound was counted in
three different ﬁelds.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis
In vitro samples.. RNA was extracted with the TRIzol reagent (Life
Technologies), and RNA samples (1 mg) were subjected to reverse
transcription using the Reverse Transcription System (Promega).
TaqMan real-time RT-PCR (Life Technologies) analysis of the
cDNA samples was conducted in an ABI7700 Sequence Detection
System (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) using the following speciﬁc
primers: PSA (KLK3; Hs02576345_m1), AR (Hs00171172_m1),
KIF2C (Hs00901710_m1), FOXO1 (Hs01054576_m1), KIFC1
(Hs00954801_m1), E-cadherin (CDH1; Hs01023894_m1),
N-cadherin (CDH2; Hs00983056_m1), Twist (TWIST1;
Hs01675818_s1), vimentin (VIM; Hs00185584_m1), and 18S

10 mg/kg; day 7 and 11, 5 mg/kg) dosed intraperitoneally and
harvested on day 14. TRAMPþ/DNTGFbRIIþ male mice were
castrated and treated with cabazitaxel (day 3 and 7, 10 mg/kg; day
11 and 15, 5 mg/kg) and harvested on day 18.

Immunoﬂuorescent confocal microscopy
Cells were plated (1  105) on cover glass in 6-well plates. After
24 to 48 hours, cells were exposed to medium (RPMI1640 with
10% CSS) in the presence of DHT (1 nmol/L), cabazitaxel (35–
100 nmol/L), MDV3100 (1 mmol/L), or in combination of the two
agents. Following treatment, cells were ﬁxed in 100% methanol
and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in sterile PBS. Fixed
cells were incubated overnight with primary antibody speciﬁc for
AR (N-20) and tubulin (Abcam Cell Signaling) at 4 C with gentle
rocking and the appropriate Alexa-Fluor (Life Technologies)
ﬂuorescent secondary (1.5 hours, room temperature). Slides were
mounted using Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI and
were visualized using a FV1000 Confocal Microscope (Markey
Cancer Center Core, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY).

Immunohistochemical analysis
Tissue specimens from human CRPC (22Rv1) xenografts and
transgenic mouse prostate tumors were formalin-ﬁxed and parafﬁn-embedded; serial sections (5 mm) were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies against E-cadherin, Ncadherin, AR (N-20), MCAK, HSET, pH3, ZEB1, cytokeratin-18,
and CD31. After blocking nonspeciﬁc binding, sections were
incubated with primary antibody (overnight, 4 C) and were
subsequently exposed to biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (2
hours, room temperature) and horseradish peroxidase–streptavidin (EMD Millipore). Signal/Color detection was achieved with
SigmaFast 3, 30 -diaminobenzidine tablets (Sigma-Aldrich) and
counterstained with hematoxylin. TUNEL analysis of apoptotic
cells was performed as previously described (35). Images were
captured via light microscopy (40 and 100) using an Olympus
BX51 microscope (Olympus America). The intensity and level of
immunoreactivity was recorded by two independent observers.

Flow cytometric analysis
The human prostate cancer cells harboring the AR variants
PC3v567es and 22Rv1 cells were exposed to various treatments
(MDV, cabazitaxel, or combination for 24–96 hours) and subjected to washing with PBS in 0.1% BSA. Cells were subsequently
ﬁxed with 100% ethanol (20 C). For cell-cycle analysis, cells
were incubated with propidium iodide solution with RNase A (10
mg/mL) overnight at 4 C. Samples were analyzed using BectonDickinson FACSCalibur (ﬂow cytometry core at the University of
Kentucky, Lexington, KY).
In vivo tumor targeting studies
All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the
guidelines approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of
the University of Kentucky and according to the NIH (Bethesda,
MD) recommendations and reporting standards. Male nude mice
(5–6-week-old) were subcutaneously injected with 22Rv1 cells
(2  106 cells), and after tumors were palpable, mice were divided
into four groups, 5 mice/group: (i) control group receiving 1%
medium/0.1% Tween-20 daily via oral gavage; (ii) cabazitaxel
treatment group mice received cabazitaxel (day 1 and 4, 5 mg/kg;
day 8 and 14, 2.5 mg/kg) via tail-vein injection for 2 weeks; (c)
enzalutamide group mice receiving 30 mg/kg MDV3100 via
intraperitoneal injection for 2 weeks; (iv) and cabazitaxel and
MDV3100 combination group mice receiving both cabazitaxel
and enzalutamide for 2 weeks. Tumors were measured twice a
week, and the volume was calculated (length  width  0.5236).
Prostate tumor xenografts were harvested at 4 days after the last
treatment and histopathologically analyzed. Formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded sections were subjected to immunostaining for
expression and localization of AR, mitotic kinesins, EMT, vascularity (CD31), and apoptosis (TUNEL, EMD Millipore). TUNEL
analysis of apoptotic cells in situ was performed as previously
described (35).
Transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer progression
Mice were maintained under environmentally controlled conditions and subjected to a 12-hour light/dark cycle with food and
water ad libitum. Mice TRAMPþ/DNTGFbRIIþ (16–18 weeks;
ref. 35) were matched with littermates and were treated with
either VHC or highest nontoxic dose of cabazitaxel (day 0 and 3,

Statistical analysis
Student t test, one-way, or two-way ANOVA were performed
using GraphPad Prism 6 software to determine the statistical
signiﬁcance of difference between means/treatments. All numerical data are presented as mean  SEM. Statistical signiﬁcance was
set at P < 0.05.

Results
Signiﬁcance of AR status in prostate cancer cell response to
cabazitaxel
The preclinical efﬁcacy of cabazitaxel chemotherapy against
prostate cancer was originally demonstrated using the androgenindependent human cancer cell line, DU145 (lacking AR) as a
model (14). To establish the cellular response of androgensensitive and CRPC cancer cells to cabazitaxel treatment, a panel
of human prostate cancer cell lines with varying AR expression
status was used. A dose–response analysis of prostate cancer cell
viability to increasing concentrations of cabazitaxel (10–500
nmol/L) for 96 hours demonstrated that DU145 cells were highly
sensitive to cabazitaxel treatment consistent with earlier reports
(14; Fig. 1A). A time-course analysis of the temporal response to
increasing treatment periods to cabazitaxel (100 nmol/L) was also
conducted (Fig. 1B). The androgen-independent PC3 cells exhibited a similar sensitivity to cabazitaxel as the DU145 cells (Fig. 1A
and B). In contrast, PC3 cells with forced overexpression of the AR
splice variant v567es (PC3v567es) were resistant to cabazitaxel
even at very high doses of the drug, compared with parental PC3
cells (Fig. 1A). The CRPC cell line 22Rv1, harboring a mix of AR
variants as well as the full-length AR, exhibited relative resistance
to low doses of cabazitaxel and short treatment periods (24–48
hours), but after longer treatment (over 72 hours), there was a
signiﬁcant loss of cell viability (Fig. 1A and B). The androgenresponsive cells VCaP (full-length AR) were resistant to cabazitaxel (500 nmol/L) compared with LNCaP and LNCaPTbRII cells
(Fig. 1A and B).
To examine the effect of AR-targeting inhibition by the antiandrogen (MDV3100, MDV) to sensitize prostate cancer cells to
cabazitaxel, human prostate cancer cell lines were treated with

cabazitaxel alone (100 nmol/L) or in combination with MDV
(1–10 mmol/L). The PC3v567es cells did not exhibit further cell
death as a result of antiandrogen treatment compared with cabazitaxel alone (except at supraphysiologic concentrations; Fig. 1C).
For the androgen-sensitive and cabazitaxel-resistant VCaP cells
(Fig. 1A), exposure to increasing concentrations of MDV in combination with cabazitaxel resulted in a signiﬁcant loss of viability (P
< 0.05; Fig. 1C). The CRPC 22Rv1 cells (harboring a mixture of fulllength AR and AR splice variants) exhibited loss of viability in
response to cabazitaxel alone; however, combination of the taxane
with MDV at high concentrations (10 mmol/L) led to an increase in
cell viability compared with the single cabazitaxel treatment (Fig.
1C) and untreated control cells. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that for
the PC3v567es cells, cabazitaxel treatment promotes G2 and Sphase arrest (Fig. 1D and E). For CRPC 22Rv1 cells, exposure to
cabazitaxel alone or in combination with enzalutamide (96 hours)
resulted in a signiﬁcant G2 arrest (Fig. 1F and G). Treatment of
PC3v567es and 22Rv1 cells with cabazitaxel led to increased
prostate cell population in the S and G2 phase regardless of
androgens.
Recent work from this laboratory demonstrated that combination therapy of taxanes (docetaxel) and N-terminal targeting
of AR with novel antiandrogens enhanced the therapeutic
efﬁcacy of taxane against CRPC tumor growth (36). Thus, we
comparatively analyzed the dose response of prostate cancer
cells to docetaxel (microtubule targeting) and MDV (AR targeting) given as single agents or in combination (Supplementary
Fig. S1A–S1C). The PC3, PCv567es, 22Rv1, and LNCaP cells
exhibited resistance to MDV, but all the cell lines showed
partial sensitivity to docetaxel (Supplementary Fig. S1A and
S1B, respectively). Combination of docetaxel and MDV led to a
signiﬁcant loss of cell viability for all of the prostate cancer cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Overexpression of AR variants
in PC3 cells resulted in stable clones PC3567es, PC3v7, and
PCv12 that all exhibited a signiﬁcant increase in their migration
potential compared with parental control cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1D).
Effect of cabazitaxel on AR expression, localization, and activity
Docetaxel chemotherapy has been shown to impair prostate
cancer growth by preventing the physical translocation of cytoplasmic AR into the nucleus ultimately inhibiting the activity of
AR-regulated target genes (PSA; refs. 15–17). LNCaP and VCaP
cells grown in CSS media were subjected to confocal microscopy
analysis that indicated a diffused distribution of AR between the
cytoplasm and the nucleus in LNCaP control cells (Fig. 2A).
Treatment with DHT (Fig. 2A) resulted in AR translocation to
the nucleus. Treatment with the antiandrogen MDV (1 mmol/L; 24
hours) increased cytoplasmic AR with no apparent effect on
microtubule structural network (Fig. 2A; ref. 4). Cabazitaxel
reduced overall AR immunoreactivity, while it sustained the
nuclear localization of AR regardless of androgens or antiandrogens. Treatment of VCaP cells for 24 hours with MDV followed by
pulsing with DHT (2 hours) was analyzed by confocal microscopy
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). AR localization was primarily conﬁned
to the nucleus, indicating that MDV was unable to completely
block the androgen-mediated AR nuclear translocation (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Treatment of VCaP with cabazitaxel (96 hours)
leads to AR nuclear localization independently of androgens (Fig.
2A and Supplementary Fig. S2). There was a signiﬁcant impact by
cabazitaxel treatment on the microtubule structure, with tubule

916 Cancer Res; 76(4) February 15, 2016

bundling on the periphery of the cell and complete loss of ﬁbrous
microtubule network appearance (Fig. 2A; green). The effects on
the microtubule appearance were consistently detected in
response to cabazitaxel, associated with remarkable multinucleation in both cell lines (zoom images; Fig. 2A and Supplementary
Fig. S2A). The PC3v567es cells expressing AR variant v567es
(resistant to cabazitaxel; Fig. 1A and B) were treated with cabazitaxel and subjected to confocal microscopy. Cabazitaxel exerts
the bundling effect on microtubule structures (Supplementary
Fig. S3), reduces AR levels, and fails to sustain nuclear localization
of AR v567es. Extensive multinucleation is observed for
PC3v567es cells in response to cabazitaxel.
To determine the effect of cabazitaxel treatment on AR expression, LNCaP and VCaP prostate cancer cells were treated for 24,
48, or 72 hours with cabazitaxel alone or pulsed with DHT for 3
hours prior to cell lysis and Western blot analysis. Cabazitaxel
treatment for 72 hours markedly reduced AR protein levels in the
androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and VCaP
(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2A, respectively). Expression of
b-tubulin was not affected. Cabazitaxel treatment (48 hours) led
to caspase-3 cleavage, indicating apoptosis induction (Fig. 2B). To
conﬁrm the effect of cabazitaxel on AR localization, we performed
subcellular fractionation analysis in LNCaP cells after exposure to
cabazitaxel (24, 48, or 72 hours) alone or pulsed with R1881
(1 nmol/L for 2 hours). Androgens predictably increased nuclear
AR expression compared with controls (Fig. 2C). Cabazitaxel
treatment for 24 to 48 hours decreased AR levels in LNCaP cells,
while there was nuclear retention of AR (Fig. 2C); by 72 hours, AR
levels were diminished in both cytosolic and nuclear fractions
(Fig. 2C). To establish that the effect of cabazitaxel on AR expression was a consequence of transcriptional inhibition, the AR
mRNA levels were evaluated. LNCaP cells were treated with
cabazitaxel (24, 48, or 72 hours) alone or pulsed with DHT for
2 hours prior to mRNA extraction. Cabazitaxel treatment (24
hours) led to downregulation of AR mRNA (Fig. 2D). Moreover,
cabazitaxel signiﬁcantly inhibited expression of the AR-regulated
gene PSA and AR interactor FOXO1 (Fig. 2E and F), respectively,
indicating targeting of AR transcriptional activity by cabazitaxel. A
similar effect of cabazitaxel on AR-regulated gene expression was
also found for the VCaP cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C–S2E).
Cabazitaxel causes multinucleation in prostate cancer cells by
targeting kinesins
As chemotherapeutic agents, taxanes can effectively target the
microtubules and the mitotic spindle apparatus, thus blocking
cellular division by inducing G2–M arrest and apoptosis (37).
Confocal microscopy analysis revealed that three human prostate cancer cell lines with different AR status, DU145 cells (ARnegative), PC3v7 AR variant, LNCaP (mutant AR), and VCaP
(full-length AR) cells exhibited increased incidence of multinucleation in response to cabazitaxel treatment (Fig. 3A). In the
LNCaP cells, there was a disruption of the mitotic spindle and
monoastral spindle formation. Overexpression of promitotic
kinesins can facilitate taxane resistance due to their microtubule depolymerizing action. Targeting of kinesins by cabazitaxel was proﬁled by analyzing the expression of a subset of
mitotic kinesins in human prostate cancer cell lines (Fig. 3B).
MCAK kinesin plays an important role in facilitating spindle
pole capture and also acts as a microtubule depolymerizing
factor. HSET functionally mediates cytokinesis. LNCaP cells
express relatively low kinesin levels, whereas VCaP cells exhibit

Cabazitaxel Reverses EMT in Prostate Cancer

high expression of both proteins (Fig. 3B). DU145 and
PC3v567es have high expression of MCAK but completely lack
HSET protein expression (Fig. 3B). In response to cabazitaxel
(24, 48, or 72 hours) alone or under androgenic pulse, there
was a transient increase in expression of MCAK and HSET
kinesins within the ﬁrst 24 hours in the VCaP cells; by 72
hours of treatment, kinesin levels were signiﬁcantly downregulated (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S4A). In addition,
there was a signiﬁcant decrease in MCAK (KIF2C) mRNA
expression in LNCaP and VCaP cells (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S4) and in HSET (KIFC1) mRNA levels for VCaP cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C) in response to cabazitaxel.
To determine the potential link between the action of cabazitaxel on mitotic spindle formation and resistance, we subsequently examined pericentrin (marker of centrosomes) expression in the cabazitaxel-resistant prostate cancer PCv567es and
VCaP cells and the cabazitaxel-sensitive CRPC 22Rv1 cells. As
shown in Fig. 3E, in response to cabazitaxel, PC3v567es and
VCaP cells exhibited centrosome clustering and ampliﬁcation
accompanied with severe multinucleation; these effects were
not inﬂuenced by the status of androgen axis (presence of
androgens or antiandrogen, MDV; Fig. 3F). In the CRPC 22Rv1
cells, cabazitaxel treatment led to multinucleation but not
centrosomal ampliﬁcation (Supplementary Fig. S5A).
In vivo novel action of cabazitaxel in models of advanced
prostate cancer via induction of MET and glandular
differentiation
To deﬁne the physiologic signiﬁcance of our in vitro ﬁndings, we investigated the antitumor action of cabazitaxel in an
in vivo model we previously established (TRAMP mice crossed
with mice expressing a conditional dominant negative
TGFbRII; ref. 35). This TRAMP/DNTGFbRII model is characterized by aggressive tumor progression to metastasis driven
by EMT. The consequences of cabazitaxel treatment on the
phenotypic landscape and growth dynamics were evaluated in
prostate tumors from (N ¼ 10) 16 to 18–week-old male mice
(castrate vs. non-castrate groups) receiving treatment for 14
days with pharmacologic dose of cabazitaxel (Supplementary
Fig. S6A and S6B). Cabazitaxel treatment led to a signiﬁcant
decrease in the body weight as well as the prostate weight
(P < 0.005; Supplementary Fig. S6C and S6D, respectively;
P < 0.005). At 18 to 20 weeks, TRAMPþDNTGFBRIIþ mice
progressed to poorly differentiated prostate cancer (35); histopathologic evaluation (H&E staining) revealed that cabazitaxel alone or in combination with androgen depletion
restored the glandular structures and luminal secretions of
the prostate epithelium compared with controls (Fig. 4A).
Immunoreactivity of cytokeratin-18, a luminal cell and glandular differentiation marker, was markedly increased in

tumors from cabazitaxel-treated mice (noncastrate and castrate) compared with VHC (Fig. 4E).
Evaluation of prostate tumor cell–proliferative capacity based
on Ki-67 and pH3 immunoreactivity revealed an increased proliferative activity in response to cabazitaxel alone, whereas castration-induced androgen deprivation resulted in a signiﬁcant
decrease in the proliferative index (Fig. 4A and D). To correlate the
effect of cabazitaxel on the mitotic spindle with resulting multinucleation (observed in vitro; Fig. 3), expression of the nuclear
protein pH3 was examined in prostate tumors. As shown
in Fig. 4A (bottom), cabazitaxel resulted in distinct multinucleation among prostate tumor glands from cabazitaxel-treated mice,
compared with VHC (Fig. 4B, arrows). There was an increased
number of TUNEL-positive prostate tumor cells after castrationinduced androgen withdrawal, indicating apoptosis induction
(P < 0.005; Fig. 4A and C). Treatment of either intact or androgen-depleted mice with cabazitaxel (2 weeks) did not induce
signiﬁcant apoptosis (Fig. 4A and C).
The potential contribution of EMT-MET cycling to the glandular formation and reversion to differentiated prostate epithelium by cabazitaxel was subsequently interrogated. Figure 5A
indicates representative images of immunoreactivity analysis
of the EMT landscape. Certain populations of tumor epithelial
cells exhibited strong E-cadherin immunoreactivity paralleled
by decreased N-cadherin expression in response to cabazitaxel,
supporting an effect on reversing EMT (Fig. 5A). We previously
showed that prostate tumors from TRAMPþDNTGFBRII mice
exhibit accelerated progression to metastatic disease via changes
in the tumor microenvironment driven by increased inﬂammation and EMT (35). We found that cabazitaxel alone or in
combination with androgen depletion reversed EMT to MET
as reﬂected by elevated E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin
immunoreactivity (Fig. 5A). Intense nuclear immunoreactivity
for AR was detected in prostate tumors from VHC mice; upon
castration-induced ADT, there was a marked reduction in nuclear AR associated with a diffused localization to the cytoplasm
(Fig. 5B and C). Treatment of intact mice with cabazitaxel
signiﬁcantly increased nuclear AR, compared with androgen
depletion–mediated cytoplasmic translocation (Fig. 5B and
C). Prostate tumor epithelial cells in castrate mice treated with
cabazitaxel (for 2 weeks) exhibited a reduced AR expression
with a signiﬁcant reduction of nuclear AR compared with
controls or cabazitaxel alone treated mice (Fig. 5B and C).
The kinesin immunoreactivity proﬁle in prostate tumors
from the transgenic mouse model revealed decreased MCAK
expression in response to cabazitaxel (given as a single agent)
compared with VHC, castration-androgen depletion, or combination of cabazitaxel with castration (Fig. 5B). Impairing
the androgen axis (castration) alone or in combination with
cabazitaxel led to increased kinesin expression (Fig. 5B). We

failed to reach statistical signiﬁcance (Fig. 6A and B). Cabazitaxel
alone or in combination with MDV3100 led to a signiﬁcant
reduction in body weight (Supplementary Fig. S7C). Tumor
specimens from control (VHC) and treated mice were subjected
to immunohistochemical analysis for the tumor growth kinetics,
apoptosis and cell proliferation, vascularity, AR, and kinesin
expression. Treatment with cabazitaxel alone or in combination
with MDV induces signiﬁcant apoptosis (Fig. 6C and D), whereas
the antiandrogen alone failed to induce apoptosis in the CRPC
22Rv1 tumors. Tumor vascularity was inhibited in response to
cabazitaxel alone, an effect that was reversed by the combination
treatment (Fig. 6C and E). There was a signiﬁcant increase in Ki-67
immunoreactivity in response to cabazitaxel treatment, but combination with the antiandrogen suppressed prostate tumor proliferation (Fig. 6C and F). Treatment of CRPC 22Rv1 cells with
cabazitaxel downregulated MCAK protein in a temporal correlation with the loss of E-cadherin driven by cabazitaxel (Fig. 6G). A
pattern of transient changes in AR levels in CRPC 22Rv1 cells was
observed in response to cabazitaxel; full-length AR levels were
reduced within 24 hours, followed by a signiﬁcant increase at 48
hours, compared with controls (Fig. 6G).
The impact of cabazitaxel on EMT landscape in the CRPC
xenografts was proﬁled with three marker proteins, E-cadherin,
N-cadherin, and ZEB-1. As shown in Fig. 7A, cabazitaxel treatment
resulted in increased E-cadherin, while it decreased N-cadherin
and ZEB1 immunoreactivity, indicating abrogation of EMT programming in response to the taxane. These in vivo phenotypic
ﬁndings in the CRPC xenograft model are consistent with the
effect of the drug in the transgenic model of EMT-driven prostate
tumor progression (Fig. 5). Also shown in Fig. 7 is the effect of
cabazitaxel on reducing kinesin levels, both MCAK and HSET, in
CRPC tumors (Fig. 7B). Antiandrogen treatment had no significant effect on HSET levels, while it reduced MCAK expression.
Cabazitaxel treatment reduced AR expression, but it maintained a
strong AR nuclear localization in CRPC 22Rv1 tumors compared
with MDV3100 or the combination (Fig. 7C).

Discussion
Microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapeutic agents such as docetaxel and paclitaxel have been shown to inhibit AR nuclear
localization and activity in human prostate cancer, an action that
correlates with the therapeutic response in patients (16, 17). The
present results demonstrate that in in vitro and in vivo models of
androgen-sensitive and CRPC-advanced prostate tumors, cabazitaxel chemotherapy maintains AR nuclear localization, while it
inhibits AR expression. These observations are in contrast to the
effect of docetaxel on preventing nuclear translocation of the AR
from the cytosol we and others have reported (16, 17). Moreover,
our data demonstrate that the sensitivity of human prostate cancer
cells to cabazitaxel was not associated with the AR variant status.
Thus, PC3 AR v567es (androgen-independent) and VCaP (androgen-responsive) cells exhibited comparable degree of resistance to
cabazitaxel treatment in accord with recent evidence that the
antitumor effect of cabazitaxel proceeds via an AR-independent
mechanism (38). The mechanisms driving therapeutic crossresistance to taxanes and antiandrogens in CRPC involve microtubule stabilization and inhibition of AR activity and nuclear
localization by interfering with tubulin–AR association (16–18).
Compelling evidence identiﬁed new signaling effectors conferring
mechanistic resistance to taxane chemotherapy in CRPC, includ-

ing overexpression of ERG genes (39) and activation of the
GATA2-IGF2 signaling axis (40).
During cell migration in interphase, centrosome-mediated
nucleation of a microtubule array enables directionality, and
centrosome ampliﬁcation promotes transient spindle multipolarity during mitosis and correlates with tumor aggressiveness
(41–43). The phenomenon of severe multinucleation that predominated the cabazitaxel-treated prostate cancer cells regardless
of AR status, as well as the ability of the drug to induce centrosome
ampliﬁcation promoting spindle multipolarity in the resistant
cancer cell lines, provides a shift in our understanding of therapeutic resistance to taxane chemotherapy. This study identiﬁed
that MCAK is a direct target of cabazitaxel in both androgensensitive and CRPC tumors. The kinesin spindle protein (KSP) is a
molecular motor that crawls along the microtubules to assist cell
division (also known Eg5), and different mitotic kinesins serve
speciﬁc functions during cell division. In accordance with our
ﬁndings, MCAK was implicated as a potential mitosis phase target
due to its overexpression in CRPC detected in gene expression
datasets (44). The effect of cabazitaxel on nuclear AR retention in
preclinical models of androgen-sensitive prostate tumors and
CRPC is in contrast to docetaxel action (ﬁrst-line taxane) in
promoting cytosolic AR (16, 17). Disruption of the mitotic
spindle via direct targeting of mitotic kinesins inducing multinucleation of prostate cancer cells might drive the nuclear retention of AR and inability of microtubules to navigate its cytoplasmic distribution/propagation. As we showed that this effect of
cabazitaxel on AR can be overcome by treatment with enzalutamide in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer, the above argument
drives a molecular rationale for the therapeutic sequencing of
antitumor action of cabazitaxel and the antiandrogen in CRPC
tailored to the AR variant status (Fig. 6H).
Cabazitaxel can effectively stabilize microtubule structures in
androgen-sensitive and CRPC cells in accordance with the known
action of this taxane chemotherapeutic agent (14, 45). With the
knowledge that cabazitaxel was designed to bind with b-tubulin
subunits and stabilize their interaction preventing depolymerization of the structure, once assembled, the microtubules cannot
disassemble, leading to mitotic blockade. In contrast to docetaxel
that induced microtubule stabilization leading to classic G2–M
arrest and apoptosis as well as AR cytoplasmic localization, we
report for the ﬁrst time that cabazitaxel treatment induces severe
multinucleation and centrosome clustering that led to the development of monoastral spindle formations in the androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells. Thus, in addition to microtubule
stabilization, cabazitaxel targets expression of premitotic kinesins, which facilitate this process (46). The inhibitory effect of
cabazitaxel on protein and mRNA expression of MCAK and HSET
kinesins provides an initial mechanistic insight into the ability of a
microtubule chemotherapy to effectively target a mitotic kinesin
and consequently interfering with AR transport across the microtubules, leading to tumor suppression (illustrated on Fig. 6H).
Although early-phase clinical trials in CRPC patients using the
ﬁrst-generation Eg5 inhibitor, Ispinesip, have met limited success
(45), the concept that kinesins may deﬁne therapeutic targeting of
cabazitaxel in advanced prostate cancer gains support from evidence documenting a correlation between overexpression of KSP
MCAK with CRPC progression and functional involvement of
motor protein Eg5 in prostate cancer cell growth (44).

Cabazitaxel Reverses EMT in Prostate Cancer

disease, we analyzed the consequences of cabazitaxel on EMT in
prostate tumor progression in vivo. Prostate tumors from mice
treated with cabazitaxel alone or in combination with ADT
exhibited a phenotypically redifferentiated glandular prostate
epithelium with intact luminal secretions. It could be postulated
that the plasticity afforded to a fully differentiated epithelium by
cabazitaxel allows individual cells to dedifferentiate into mesenchymal-like derivatives in reversible phenotypic transformative
process. Thus, several rounds of EMT and MET allow for the
formation of well-differentiated glandular epithelial structures in
response to cabazitaxel. In a twist of growth kinetics, cabazitaxel
increased the proliferative activity of prostate tumor cells. Considering that a dynamic EMT-MET cycling has been functionally
implicated in the formation of epithelial tissues (47), our
data support the ability of cabazitaxel to induce epithelial differentiation of aggressive prostate tumors via reversal of EMT to MET.
Thus, we speculate that upon elimination of the primary population of prostate cancer cells targeted by cabazitaxel, a subset
of prostate tumor epithelial cells undergo MET, and this reversion
to glandular differentiated epithelial cells primes prostate tumors
to the antiandrogen action towards overcoming resistance,
highlighting the therapeutic value in the cycling of EMT to MET
(Fig. 6H). Moreover, our work provides a molecular basis for the
emerging role of AR variants in predicting therapeutic resistance of
advanced CRPC to enzalutamide (9) and taxanes in experimental
models of CRPC (48). Overexpression of AR splice variants may
preclude patients from undergoing cabazitaxel and antiandrogen
combination therapy due to therapeutic resistance driven by
centrosome clustering. An insight into this cross-resistance is
enabled by our observations that the combination of cabazitaxel
and enzalutamide leads to a signiﬁcant growth stimulatory
response in the CRPC 22Rv1 cells (harboring AR variants), whereas in the androgen-sensitive VCaP cells, enzalutamide overcame
cabazitaxel resistance. Interestingly, it was recently reported that
enzalutamide treatment of CRPC 22Rv1 cells had no effect on AR
V7 variant expression, whereas it upregulated V7 in VCaP cells
(49). Attractive as the biomarker value of AR proﬁling might
emerge in predicting cross-resistance to taxane chemotherapy and
antiandrogens in CRPC, one may also consider this new action of
cabazitaxel in prostate tumors that bypasses AR and points to an
optimized sequencing of these therapeutics, tailored to the EMT
landscape.
In summary, this is the ﬁrst evidence to indicate that cabazitaxel
chemotherapy reverses EMT to MET towards phenotypically dif-

ferentiated prostate glandular/luminal architecture. Cellular
redifferentiation via MET conversions may account for the similarities in the phenotypic landscape between primary tumors and
bone distant metastatic lesions that can dictate their therapeutic
resistance. Ongoing studies investigate (i) the mechanisms driving this remarkable effect of cabazitaxel on tumor glandular
differentiation by engaging the microtubule–cytoskeleton interaction and (ii) the consequences of cabazitaxel combination with
antiandrogens in clinical prostate tumor specimens from patients
with metastatic disease.
