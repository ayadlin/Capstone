ABSTRACT
Influenza viruses possess a great threat to human health, but there is still
no effective drug to deal with the outbreak of possible new influenza subtypes.
In this study, we first fractionated sialylated immunoglobulin G (IgG), mainly Fab
sialylated fraction, with sambucus nigra agglutinin affinity chromatography. We
then demonstrated that sialylated IgG possessed more effective neutralizing activity
against 2009 A (H1N1) subtype than that of IgG mixture, and sialosides on the Fab
is crucial in this neutralization reaction as when such residues were removed with
neuraminidase A digestion the blocking effect was significantly reduced. It appears
that sialic acid residues attached to Fab could serve as binding moieties to receptor
binding site of influenza virus. These findings indicate that sialylated IgG probably
is an effective anti-influenza broad-spectrum drug utilizing its receptor mimicry to
competitively inhibit the attachment of influenza viruses with sialic acid receptors on
target cells. This property would be particularly useful if it can be applied to prevent
newly emerged influenza virus strain infections in future epidemics.

attachment coordinated by viral surface hemagglutinin
(HA) and cell surface receptors is the essential first
step for influenza virus infection of target cells [4],
Therefore, utilization of soluble sialic acid-containing
macromolecules to competitively combine with viral HA
could be a hopeful strategy for prevention and treatment
of influenza viral infection.
As the key player of humoral immune response, it
has long been known that IgG molecules are glycoproteins
[5]. The asparagine 297 (Asn 297) in the CH2 domains
of the Fc region is the conservative glycosylation site,
extra N-glycans possibly attach to the variable regions
of the IgG Fab portions, and about 15% to 25% normal
human IgG Fab bear N-linked oligosaccharides [6-8].
Human IgG-Fc oligosaccharide is of the biantennary
complex type with a core heptasaccharide and variable
addition of outer arm sugar residues [9]. The glycans of
the Fab are of biantennary complex type too, with highly

INTRODUCTION
Influenza viruses are enveloped negative-stranded
RNA viruses possessing a great threat to human health.
There have been four influenza pandemics since 1918
including these occurred in 1918, 1957, 1968 and 2009
[1]. The reported human cases infected with new avianorigin influenza subtypes including 1999 H9N2, 2005
H5N1, 2013 H7N9, 2013 H6N1 and 2014 H10N8 have
been on the increase in the last two decades [2]. This
increase further highlights the urgency and importance of
prevention and treatment of possible next pandemics by
new variants of influenza viruses.
It was suggested that the precondition for an avian
influenza virus infection and transmission in humans is
the alteration of its receptor preference from α2-3- linked
sialosides (avian influenza receptors) to α2-6- linked
sialosides (human influenza receptors) [3], and the

sialylated residues in contrast to Fc glycans [10, 11]. If
IgG Fab sialosides could react with HA, sialylated IgG
will probably be an effective and broad-spectrum antiinfluenza molecule in light of its subsequent powerful
clearance mechanisms activated by Fc regions including
antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC),
complement dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDC) and
phagocytosis etc [5, 12,13].
In this study, sialylated IgG was first fractionated
with sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) affinity
chromatography
from
purchased
intravenous
immunoglobulin G (IVIG) (Shanghai RAAS, China).
In consistent with the reports of Johannes Stadlmann
etc [14], the binding fractions of IVIG including elution
fraction 1 (E1) IVIG and elution fraction 2 (E2) IVIG
with SNA agarose column were mainly bound by Fab
sialylation. The more effective neutralizing activity against
2009 A (H1N1) subtype of sialylated IgG including E1
IVIG and E2 IVIG in comparison to IVIG mixture and
flow through fraction (FT) IVIG was demonstrated with
real time PCR and Western blot after infection of A549
or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK cells). In
addition, the reaction of influenza virus with sialylated
IgG through sialic acid residues on IgG molecules was
further established by reduced neutralizing activity after
desialylation of sialylated IVIG with neuraminidase (NA)
digestion. These results indicate that sialylated IVIG
probably is an effective anti-influenza broad-spectrum
drug utilizing its receptor mimicry to competitively inhibit
the attachment of influenza viruses to sialic acid receptors
on target cells.

F digested fractions. The difference in molecular weight
of the three IVIG fractions (FT, E1 and E2 IVIG) were
first assessed with reducing SDS-PAGE followed by
silver stain, Western blot or Lectin blot. With silver stain
analysis (Figure 1B), higher molecular weight bands
above the 50 kDa heavy chain and the 25 kDa light chain
of E1 IVIG and E2 IVIG fractions must be due to extra
N-link carbohydrates attachment, which fell back to the
normal molecular weight following deglycosylation
with PNGase F. With Western blot analysis, these extra
bands were confirmed to be IgG heavy chains (above the
50 kDa band) and Igκ or λ light chain (above the 25 kDa
band) respectively (Figure 1C–1E). The carbohydrates
attached to these bands were terminal sialylation linked
with α-2,6 but not α-2,3 as shown by Lectin blot with
biotinylated SNA and MAA (Figure 1F&1G). In addition,
the denatured and reduced heavy chain of FT IVIG also
reacted with SNA although weaker than E1 and E2 IVIG
indicating that FT IVIG was not non-sialylated IVIG. The
oligosaccharides attached at Asn 297 are “enclosed” within
the protein structure to define protein spatial structure
[20]. So these sialylated glycans of FT IVIG appear to be
inaccessible by SNA in natural state, but are exposed under
denaturation and reduction state and accessible by SNA.

SNA affinity chromatography mainly enriched
Fab sialylated IVIG
IVIG fractions were further enzyme-digested into
Fab and Fc (contain undigested IVIG) fragments using
papain to locate the site of sialic acid contributing to the
binding with SNA agarose column of E1 and E2 IVIG.
With silver stain analysis (Figure 2A), additional
higher molecular weight bands in E1 and E2 IVIG Fab
fragments were generated comparing with FT IVIG Fab
fragments and these higher molecular weight bands fell
back to the normal molecular weight following enzyme
digestion with PNGase F. In contrast, there was no
molecular weight difference among FT, E1 and E2 IVIG
Fc fragments. As shown in Figure 2B–2D, these additional
higher molecular weight bands in E1 and E2 IVIG Fab
fragments were the mixture of IVIG heavy chain Fd
fraction not Fc fraction (Figure 2B), κ light chain (Figure
2C) and λ light chain (Figure 2D). No SNA reactive Fab
fragments, additional higher molecular weight bands,
were detected in FT IVIG Fab fragments indicating that
all Fab sialylated IVIG were enriched by SNA affinity
chromatography (Figure 2E). The positive reaction of
FT IVIG Fc fragments with SNA under denaturation and
reduction state further affirmed the intramolecular location
of Asn 297 oligosaccharides in natural state (Figure 2E).
Based on these findings, SNA affinity chromato­
graphy mainly enriched Fab sialylated IgG. Part sialic
acids located at Fc Asn 297 may also bind to SNA agarose
column in natural state, but the contribution should be far
below the contribution of Fab sialic acids.

RESULTS
Fractionation of IVIG with SNA affinity
chromatography
Lectin affinity chromatography with sialic acidspecific SNA has been extensively applied in enrichment
of sialylated IVIG. In earlier studies, the two SNA+ IVIG
fractions including E1 IVIG (elution with 0.5 M neutral
lactose in pH 7.5 TBS) and E2 IVIG (elution with 0.5 M
lactose in 0.2 M acetic acid) were pooled together [14–16].
It is worthy to note that E2 IVIG exerted a more effective
anti-inflammatory effect compared to E1 IVIG when E1
and E2 were collected and analyzed separately [17]. In this
study, we also collected and analyzed E1 fraction and E2
fraction separately (Figure 1A).
Unlike other immunoglobulin subtypes including
IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE, human IgG does not contain
O-linked glycans [18]. PNGase F is an amidase that
cleaves almost all N-link carbohydrates between the
innermost GlcNAc and Asn residues from glycoproteins
[19]. It would be an effective method to determine the
contribution of carbohydrates in the molecular weight
by comparing the difference of before and after PNGase

The neutralizing activity of IgG mixture against
2009 A (H1N1) subtype

(B&D) were gradually reduced along with the increase of
IVIG indicating the neutralizing activity of IVIG against
2009 A (H1N1) subtype. Remarkable neutralizing activity
was identified in the 100 μg/ml dosage group, we adopted
this concentration to further compare the neutralizing
activities between SNA- IVIG and SNA+ IVIG.

IVIG is a product pooled and manufactured
from more than 1000 healthy donors’ plasma. Because
most donors very likely have been infected with
seasonal influenza viruses and vaccinated, it would be
understandable that IVIG contains antibodies against
influenza viruses in spite of sialylated Fab. In fact,
the protective role of IVIG against seasonal H1N1
and pandemic H1N1 2009 viruses has been reported
previously [21–23]. In this study, virus was preincubated
with different doses of IVIG first to determine whether
IVIG purchased from Shanghai RAAS, China possesses
antibodies against Influenza A/Nanchang/8002/2009
(H1N1) virus strain. As shown in Figure 3, the expressions

The comparison of neutralizing activity among IVIG
and its fractions including FT IVIG, E1 IVIG and E2 IVIG
were performed through examining the changes of viral
M2 mRNA and virus NP in infected MDCK cells (A&C)
and A549 cells (B&D) with real time qPCR and Western
blot (Figure 4). Decreased M2 and NP expression in IVIG
and FT IVIG groups in comparison to PBS group indicated
the existence of antibodies with their Fab variable regions

matrix 2 (M2) mRNA and virus Nucleoprotein (NP) in infected MDCK cells (A&C) and A549 cells (B&D) were examined with real time
qPCR and Western blot 24 h post infection. Reduction of M2 and NP expression indicated the neutralizing activity of IVIG. Data was

preincubated with 100 μg/ml IVIG, FT IVIG, E1 IVIG or E2 IVIG for 30 minutes before infection of MDCK or A549 cells. No virus
infection (Mock) and PBS-preincubated virus were used as negative and positive controls respectively. The expressions of viral M2 mRNA
and virus NP in infected MDCK cells A&C. and A549 cells B&D. were examined with real time qPCR and Western blot 24 h post
infection. Decreased M2 and NP expression in IVIG and FT IVIG groups in comparison to PBS group indicated the existence of antibodies
against influenza virus in IVIG through the Fab variable region. Lower M2 and NP expression levels showed a more effective neutralizing
activity of SNA+ IVIG (E1 IVIG and E2 IVIG) in comparison with IVIG and SNA- IVIG (FT IVIG). Data was presented as means ± S.D.

against influenza viruses in IVIG (Figure 4). There was
no significant difference in M2 and NP expression in FT
IVIG group before and after treatments with NA, both of
which were lower than that of the PBS group. This further
proved that the neutralizing effect of this fraction should
be derived from Fab variable region rather than from the
sialic acids attached to the Fab (Figure 5).
Lower M2 and NP expression levels showed a more
effective neutralizing activity of SNA+ IVIG (E1 IVIG
and E2 IVIG) in comparison to IVIG and SNA- IVIG
(FT IVIG) (Figure 4). In order to determine whether the
more effective neutralizing activity of SNA+ IVIG was
derived from the reaction between viral HA and sialosides
of SNA+ IVIG but not an antibody-antigen reaction, FT
IVIG, E1 IVIG and E2 IVIG were desialylated using NA
before preincubation with the virus. As shown in Figure
5, the neutralizing activity of SNA+ IVIG (E1 IVIG and
E2 IVIG) were reduced after desialylation with NA. In
contrast, there was no notable change in neutralizing
activity of FT IVIG before and after treatment with NA.

would be powerless in fighting newly emerged variants of
influenza viruses at their first encounter.
It is believed that the first step for a wide variety
of influenza viruses to infect target cells is attachment
coordinated by viral surface protein HA and cell surface
receptors sialic acid residues. Based on what we found
in this study, it would be a reasonable strategy to prevent
or treat influenza virus infection with sialylated IgG to
competitively inhibit the attachment of influenza viruses
to target cells. In this study, we first purified sialylated IgG
with lectin chromatography, and established that sialosides
attached to Fab fragments were the main contributors to
the binding with SNA in affinity chromatography. The
characteristic of glycans attached to Fab fragments, which
are exposed on the surface of the IgG molecules accessible
to lectin and other proteins, renders them capable of
binding to viral surface protein HA but not to hinder the
reaction between Fc fragments and Fc receptors to activate
clearance mechanisms.
The oligosaccharides attached at Asn 297 of IgG
Fc fragment are “enclosed” within the protein structure
[20].The positive reaction of FT IVIG Fc fragments with
SNA under denaturation and reduction state (Figure 2E)
further affirmed the intramolecular location of Asn 297
oligosaccharides in natural state. Thereby, SNA affinity
chromatography mainly enriched Fab sialylated IgG.
Portions of sialic acids located at Fc Asn 297 may also
bind to SNA agarose column in natural state, but the
contribution should be far below that of Fab sialic acids.
The receptor binding site (RBS) of influenza viruses
is a shallow pocket located on the surface of HA, and the
interactions between the amino acid residues of the RBS
and the glycan ligands of receptors are weak (Kdiss > 0.1
mM) [30]. The specificity and affinity of HA for its glycan
ligand are related not only to the type of sialic acid linkage
(α2-3 or α2-6) but also to glycan modifications including
fucosylation, sulphation and additional sialylation
[31-33]. It would be an important strategy to use gene
recombination technology to increase the number of
glycans and alter the configuration of sialyloligosaccharide
moieties located on the Fab fragments to enhance the
affinity and avidity of IgG in its reaction to HA.
In conclusion, we found that sialylated IgG could
neutralize 2009 A (H1N1) influenza virus via its Fab
attached sialosides binding to viral surface protein HA.
This would provide a hopeful strategy to treat or prevent
influenza viral infection with sialylated IgG in view of the
fact that IVIG have been used clinical to treat a variety
of diseases with little side effect for over 35 years. This
would be particularly useful if it can be successfully
utilized to prevent infection by newly emerged influenza
virus strains in future epidemics which pose a great threat
to human health.

DISCUSSION
IVIG, as a healthy human plasma derived product,
has been widely used clinically in the treatment of many
diseases including immunodeficiency, autoimmune
diseases and inflammatory disorders etc with little side
effect [8,24]. IVIG also possesses cross-reactive specific
antibodies against viral antigens and its protective role
against influenza viruses and clinical utilization in against
complications of infection such as severe pneumonitis and
influenza encephalopathy have been reported previously
[21–23].
In this study, we observed the neutralizing activities
of IVIG against Influenza A/Nanchang/8002/2009 (H1N1)
virus strain (Figure 3). As IVIG is a mixture of over 1000
healthy individuals, it would be understandable that IVIG
contains antibody population against HA, NA or other
viral antigens of the virus with the Fab variable region
rather than with the sialic acids attached to the Fab. As
shown in Figure 4, SNA- IVIG (FT IVIG) could neutralize
2009 A (H1N1) influenza virus strain. The neutralizing
effect of this fraction should be derived from Fab variable
region rather than from the sialic acids attached to the Fab
as there was no significant difference in neutralization of
FT IVIG before and after treatments with NA (Figure 5).
Therefore, cross-reactive specific antibodies with their Fab
variable region against influenza virus exist in IVIG.
Recent studies have much more focused on
searching for monoclonal antibodies cross-reacting
to influenza virus [25-29]. Despite of the fact that
monoclonal antibodies might be more specific and
effective to neutralize existing influenza viral strain, they

SNA+ IVIG. No significant difference in M2 and NP expressions in FT IVIG groups before and after treatments with NA, both of which were
lower than that of the PBS group, further proved that the neutralizing effect of this fraction was derived from Fab variable region rather than
from the sialic acids attached to the Fab. NA (+): with neuraminidase digestion; NA (-): without neuraminidase digestion. Data was presented

Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)

Ethics statement

The fractions of IVIG and their fragments with or
without PNGase F treatment were separated with 10%
SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. In brief, samples
were denatured with heating at 100 °C for 10 minutes in
denaturing buffer (62.5 mM, pH 6.8 Tris-HCl solution
containing 10% Glycerol, 2% SDS, and 10 mM DTT), and
then loaded into 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The samples were
first ran at 80 voltage for 30 minutes, followed by ran at
120 voltage for about 60min till the dye run to the bottom
of the gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with
silver or transferred to nitrocellulose filter membranes
(Whatman, Dassel, Germany) and examined with Western
blot or Lectin blot were described below.

All experiments in this study were approved by the
Ethics Committee of Shantou University Medical College,
China.

SNA affinity chromatography
Experiment required normal human IVIG was
purchased from Shanghai RAAS, China. Before
fraction, the pH of solution should be adjusted to
7.0 with 1 M Tris Base (Sangon Biotech company,
Shanghai, China). Fraction was performed by lectin
affinity chromatography with sialic acid specific SNA
following the manufactuer’s description (Vector labs,
California, USA). In brief, IVIG was diluted with
Binding Buffer (20 mM Tris-Hcl pH7.5 containing 0.5
M NaCl and 0.1 M CaCl2) and loaded onto SNA agarose
column. The column was then washed with 5 bed
volumes Binding Buffer to remove the rest of unbound
IgG, all these unbound IgG named as flow through IVIG
(FT IVIG). The bound IVIG (SNA+ IVIG) was further
orderly eluted with Elution Buffer 1 (0.5 M lactose
pH7.5 containing 20 mM Tris-Hcl and 0.2 M NaCl)
and Elution Buffer 2 (0.5 M lactose in 0.2 M acetic
acid). These two SNA+ IVIG were separatelynamed
Elution 1 IVIG (E1 IVIG) and Elution 2 IVIG (E2
IVIG). The pH of E2 IVIG need to be adjusted to 7.0
with 1 M Tris Base after collected. The three fractions
were concentrated with Amicon Ultra-4 Centrifugal
Filter Units, 10kDa (Millipore, Massachusetts, USA)
and desalted with ZebaTM Desalt Spin Columns
(Pierce Biotechnology, Illinois, USA). The protein
concentration was measured by absorbance at 280 nm
with Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 2000/2000C (Thermo
Scientific, Illinois, USA).

Silver stain
The gels were fixed with fixation fluid (10% acetic
acid and 40% ethanol) for 30 minutes, incubated in
30% ethanol solution containing 0.5 M sodium acetate
anhydrous and 0.02 M sodium thiosulfate for 30 minutes,
washed in deionized water three times for 10 minutes
each, stained in 0.01 M silver nitrate solution combining
with 0.05% formaldehyde for 40 minutes, visualized
with the solution containing 0.24 M sodium carbonate
anhydrous and 0.05% formaldehyde and terminated with
5% acetic acid.

Western blot
For IVIG fractions and their fragments, loaded 1
μg protein aliquots and Precision Plus protein standards
(BIO-RAD, California, USA) onto 10% reducing SDSPAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the separated proteins
were transferred to nitrocellulose filter membranes. Rabbit

Denmark), mouse anti-human Ig κ chainantibody (ZSGBBIO, Beijing, China) and mouse anti-human Ig λ chain
antibody (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) at a dilution of
1:1,000 were used as primary antibodies.
For cell lysates of infected A549 or MDCK
cells, they were prepared using RIPA buffer (Millipore,
Massachusetts, USA), and the concentrations were
determined with BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific,
Illinois, USA). About 20μg protein aliquots were separated
and transferred to nitrocellulose filter membranes. Rabbit
anti-Influenza A Virus Nucleoprotein antibody (GeneTex,
California, USA) and mouse anti-β actin monoclonal
antibody (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) at a dilution of
1:1,000 were used as primary antibodies.
After incubation with appropriate secondary
antibodies including Goat anti-rabbit IgG-680 (1:10,000;

The preparation and infection of influenza virus

FUNDING

The propagation of Influenza A/Nanchang/8002/2009
(H1N1) virus was performed using embryonated eggs, and
titers were determined by 50% tissue culture infection dose
(TCID50) assay with MDCK cells.
Before infection, virus was thawed in cool water
and keep at 4 °C. The preincubation of virus with IVIG
fractions was performed at 4 °C for 30 minutes in the
ratio of 4 × 104 virus: 100 μg IVIG in 1 ml viral growth
medium. Infection was performed in 12-well tissue
culture plate at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1
for 2 h at 37 °C in the humidified atmosphere with 5
% CO2. After viral adsorption, unadsorbed viruses were
washed away with PBS and the cells were cultured for
24 h, followed by examining with real time PCR and
Western blot. No virus infection (Mock) and PBSpreincubated virus were used as negative and positive
controls respectively.

This work was supported by grants from The
National Natural Science Foundation of China (30971150).
