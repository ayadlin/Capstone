Author Manuscript

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) has crucial roles in fatty acid metabolism and is an attractive
target for drug discovery against diabetes, cancer and other diseases1–6. Saccharomyces cerevisiae
ACC (ScACC) is crucial for the production of very-long-chain fatty acids and the maintenance of
the nuclear envelope7,8. ACC contains biotin carboxylase (BC) and carboxyltransferase (CT)
activities, and its biotin is linked covalently to the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP). Most
eukaryotic ACCs are 250 kD, multi-domain enzymes and function as homo-dimers and higher
oligomers. They contain a unique, 80 kD central region that shares no homology with other
proteins. While the structures of the BC, CT and BCCP domains and other biotin-dependent
carboxylase holoenzymes are known1,9–14, currently there is no structural information on the ACC
holoenzyme. Here we report the crystal structure of the full-length, 500 kD holoenzyme dimer of
ScACC. The structure is strikingly different from those of the other biotin-dependent carboxylases.
The central region contains five domains and is important for positioning the BC and CT domains
for catalysis. The structure unexpectedly reveals a dimer of the BC domain and extensive
conformational differences compared to the structure of BC domain alone, which is a monomer.
These structural changes explain why the BC domain alone is catalytically inactive and define the
molecular mechanism for the inhibition of eukaryotic ACC by the natural product soraphen A15,16
and by phosphorylation of a Ser residue just prior to the BC domain core in mammalian ACC. The
BC and CT active sites are separated by 80 Å, and the entire BCCP domain must translocate
during catalysis.

The primary sequences of the single-chain, multi-domain eukaryotic ACCs can be divided
into three regions of roughly equal sizes. The N-terminal region (residues 1–795 in ScACC,
Fig. 1a) contains the BC and BCCP domains, with possibly a BT (BC-CT interaction)
domain between them, as observed in the structures of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC)11
and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC)12. The C-terminal region (residues 1492–
2233) contains the N and C domains of CT17. The structure and function of the central

region (residues 796–1491) are currently not known. It is not as well conserved among the
eukaryotic ACCs (Extended Data Figs. 1–3). BC catalyzes the MgATP-dependent
carboxylation of the N1′ atom of biotin (Extended Data Fig. 4). The carboxybiotin (and
BCCP) then translocates to the CT active site, where the substrate acetyl-CoA is
carboxylated.

We expressed in E. coli the 250 kD ScACC (residues 22–2233) and determined its crystal
structure at 3.2 Å resolution (Extended Data Table 1, Extended Data Fig. 4). The structure of
the ScACC holoenzyme is strikingly different from those of the other biotin-dependent
carboxylases9–14. The 500 kD holoenzyme dimer obeys two-fold symmetry, and its overall
structure is shaped like a quarter of a disk (Fig. 1b), with a radius of ~140 Å and thickness of
~120 Å (Fig. 1c), although there is a large channel measuring ~30 Å across through the
center of the holoenzyme (Extended Data Fig. 5). A BC domain dimer (Fig. 1d) is located
near the center of the disk, while the CT domain dimer (Fig. 1e) forms a part of the edge of
the disk. A BCCP domain is positioned near the center of each face of the holoenzyme, and
its biotin is located in the CT active site (Fig. 1b).
We have also determined the structure at 3.1 Å resolution of the holoenzyme where the
BCCP domain is not biotinylated (Extended Data Table 1). The overall structure of this
dimer is essentially the same as the other structure, with rms distance of 0.45 Å for their
3,928 equivalent Cα atoms, although the BCCP domain is disordered in the absence of
biotinylation. Earlier studies showed that biotinylation stabilizes E. coli BCCP18,19. This
structure of the holoenzyme will not be discussed further here.

Author Manuscript

The overall structures of the two protomers of the holoenzyme are similar, with rms distance
of 1.1 Å for 1,862 equivalent Cα atoms located within 3 Å of each other after superposition.
On the other hand, the rms distance is only 0.76 Å if the CT domains are superposed, and
differences in the orientation and position of the other domains are visible, especially for the
BC domain, which is located furthest from CT (Extended Data Fig. 4). Within CT,
conformational differences in the small inserted domain17 are observed (Extended Data Fig.
5), likely linked to differences in the position of BCCP in the two protomers, as the insert
domain has direct contacts with BCCP.

The structure reveals that the central region of ScACC contains five domains, which we have
named ACC central (AC) domains AC1 through AC5, giving a total of 10 major domains for
each ScACC protomer (Fig. 1a). Domains AC1, AC2 and AC3 are all helical (Fig. 1f,
Extended Data Fig. 2). AC1 contains three pairs of anti-parallel helices as well as inserts of a
four-helical bundle (domain AC2, helices α3–α6) and a helical hairpin (α8–α9, Extended
Data Fig. 5). AC3 is also a four-helical bundle but it has no interactions with AC1 and AC2,
and instead is positioned between AC4 and AC5, mediating interactions between them.
Domain AC4 is located at the end of the disk edge, and is separated from the AC4 domain of
the other protomer by ~200 Å (Fig. 1b). Unexpectedly, the structure shows that AC4 and
AC5 have similar backbone folds, consisting of a twisted β-sheet flanked on one face by
helices (Extended Data Figs. 4, 6). The rms distance is 2.9 Å for their equivalent Cα atoms,
but the sequence identity is only 12%. This backbone fold has weak similarity to a part of
formamidase20 (Extended Data Fig. 6) and several other enzymes, but the Z score is below

6.5 and the sequence identity is less than 9%21. The active sites of these enzymes are not
conserved in AC4 or AC5. Therefore, this structural similarity is unlikely to have any
functional significance for ACC.

Author Manuscript

The structure confirms the presence of a BT domain in the N-terminal region of ScACC
(Fig. 1a). Its structure is similar to that in PCC11, with a central, long helix (Extended Data
Fig. 4) surrounded by an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel (Extended Data Fig. 5). The
domain helps to mediate interactions between the BC and CT domains, as there are no direct
contacts between them in the holoenzyme (Fig. 1b). Within each protomer, the last three
strands of the BT domain β-barrel (β27–β29) faces the BC domain (Figs. 1b, 2a), while the
C-terminal end of the long helix and the following loop connecting to the first strand (the
hook11) is flanked by the helical hairpin insert of AC1 (α8–α9) on one side and an inserted
segment of a long loop between two β-strands (β4A and β4B) in the C domain of CT on the
other side (Fig. 2b, Extended Data Fig. 4). In addition, a part of the long linker between the
BCCP and AC1 domains has hydrophobic interactions with the top of one side of the BT
domain β-barrel (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 5).
A total of ~9,000 Å2 of the surface area of each protomer is buried in the dimer interface,
predominantly from the BC (1,200 Å2, Extended Data Fig. 7) and CT (5,800 Å2, Extended
Data Fig. 8) domain dimers. The BC domain contributes an additional 900 Å2 through
contacts with the BT domain (500 Å2, Fig. 2a), AC1 (80 Å2) and AC2 (230 Å2, Fig. 2c) of
the other protomer. The BCCP domain buries ~400 Å2 in the CT active site, where it
contacts the C domain of the other protomer, but it is expected to translocate to the BC
active site during catalysis (see below).

A major surprise from the structure is the observation of a BC domain dimer (Fig. 1d),
because the BC domain alone is consistently a monomer and catalytically inactive based on
earlier studies15,16,22,23. Moreover, the organization of this BC domain dimer is similar to
that of the BC subunit dimer of E. coli ACC24–26 (Fig. 3a), with a mostly hydrophilic
interface (Extended Data Fig. 7). However, the structure of BC domain alone is incompatible
with such a dimer due to steric clashes between the two molecules16 (Extended Data Fig. 7).
Large conformational changes for residues in the dimer interface are therefore necessary for
the formation of this dimer, primarily involving the β-strands and connecting loops in the C
sub-domain of BC (Fig. 3b). Especially, strand β18 moves by ~8 Å, taking it out of the
central β-sheet of the C-domain (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Video 1). β18 instead forms a βsheet with a new strand, β21, which is not present in the structure of BC domain alone.
Residues in the β17–β18 loop move by up to 20 Å, and those in the β18–β19 loop by up to 7
Å (Fig. 3c). In addition, the main chain of neighboring strands β17, β19, and β20 shifts by
~3 Å. The new β18-loop-β19 structure is in the center of the BC domain dimer (Fig. 3a),
where the tip of this loop contacts the side chain of Trp487 in the other protomer (Extended
Data Fig. 7).
The two distinct conformations of this domain explain why it is catalytically inactive on its
own15 and also define the molecular mechanism for the inhibition of eukaryotic ACC by the
natural product soraphen A16 and by phosphorylation of a Ser residue just prior to the BC
domain core in mammalian ACC (Ser80 in human ACC1 and Ser222 in ACC2)23 (Extended

Data Fig. 1). As a part of the conformational change, residues in the β19–β20 loop move by
up to 10 Å (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Video 2). This loop in the structure of BC domain alone
is likely to interfere with the binding of BCCP-biotin (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 7), based
on the binding mode of biotin to E. coli BC26. Consequently, BC domain alone is
catalytically inactive because it assumes a conformation that cannot bind the BCCP-biotin
substrate.

Author Manuscript

Soraphen A recognizes the conformation of isolated BC domain16, and this binding site does
not exist in the BC domain dimer in the holoenzyme due to the structural changes (Fig. 3c).
For example, strands β19 and β20 move into the binding site, and especially the side chain of
Trp487 (β19) is in direct clash with soraphen A (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 7). Therefore,
soraphen A inhibits the enzyme allosterically by stabilizing a catalytically inactive
conformation of the BC domain. In the context of the holoenzyme, soraphen A binding will
disrupt the formation of BC domain dimer (Fig. 1d), as the other protomer has clash with the
compound as well (Extended Data Fig. 7). This could also be detrimental for catalysis as the
BC domains may not be positioned correctly to accept the BCCP-biotin for carboxylation.
Upon phosphorylation, the peptide segment containing pSer222 of human ACC2 is located
in the same binding site as soraphen A23, and the Trp487 side chain in the holoenzyme
structure also clashes with this segment (Extended Data Fig. 7). Therefore, phosphorylation
of this Ser residue inhibits the enzyme through the same mechanism as that of soraphen A.
These structural observations greatly extend a model for the inhibitory mechanism proposed
earlier25 (Fig. 3e). ScACC does not have an equivalent phosphorylation site in this region of
the sequence.

Author Manuscript

In comparison, the structure of the CT domain dimer in the holoenzyme is essentially the
same as that of the domain alone17, with rms distance of 0.61 Å among their equivalent Cα
atoms (Extended Data Fig. 8). The binding of both BCCP-biotin and CoA (Extended Data
Fig. 4) in one of the CT active sites provides direct insights into the catalysis by this enzyme.
The thiol group of CoA is 4.3 Å away from the N1′ atom of biotin (Extended Data Fig. 8).
Therefore, the two substrates are likely in the correct positions for catalysis. The position of
biotin clashes with that of the compound CP-640186 (Extended Data Fig. 8), a nanomolar
inhibitor of mammalian ACCs27, confirming that it functions by blocking biotin binding to
the CT active site28.

Prior to the structure determination of the holoenzyme, we obtained the crystal structures for
residues 797–1033 (domains AC1–2), 1036–1503 (AC3–5), and 569–1494 (BT, BCCP and
the entire central region) (Extended Data Table 1). Comparisons of the structures of these
domains alone with that of the holoenzyme reveal substantial variability in the relative
positioning of the domains. Domains AC3–4 in the structure of AC3–5 alone can be readily
superposed with those in the holoenzyme, but then the orientation of domain AC5 differ by
40° (Extended Data Fig. 9). Even more variability is observed in the structure of BT-BCCPAC1–5 alone, illustrated by the differences in the positioning of AC1–2 relative to the BT
domain and AC3–5 (Extended Data Fig. 9). Interestingly, between the two unique copies of
the BT-BCCP-AC1–5 molecule in the crystal, one has a conformation of AC3–5 that is very
similar to that in the holoenzyme (Extended Data Fig. 9), while the other is similar to that in

Nature. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 April 29.

AC3–5 alone, suggesting that domains AC3–5 may assume two (or more) distinct
conformations.
Another discovery from the structure is that the central region has minimal contributions to
the formation of the dimer. Besides the ~300 Å2 surface area burial for AC1 and AC2 (Fig.
2c), the central region has no contacts with the other protomer (Fig. 1b). On the other hand,
the structure suggests that the central region is important for maintaining the BC and CT
dimers in the correct relative positions for catalysis. The CT domain dimer is sandwiched by
AC5 on both sides (Fig. 1e). The BT and AC2 domains of the two protomers form a
platform, keeping the BC domain dimer in place and possibly also helping with BC domain
dimerization (Fig. 1b). The conformational variability observed for the domains in the
central region (Extended Data Fig. 9) might play a role in regulating the activity of the
holoenzyme.

The structural analysis indicates that BCCP-biotin becomes carboxylated in the BC active
site of its own protomer, and then translocates to the CT active site at the dimer interface,
where it contacts the C domain of the other protomer (Fig. 4). The distance between the BC
and CT active sites is ~80 Å, indicating that the entire BCCP domain must translocate
during catalysis (swinging-domain model, Extended Data Fig. 4), as has been observed in
the other holoenzymes1,9–14. In fact, the linker from BT to BCCP (residues 697–700) is
about 45 Å from the N1′ atom of biotin, and therefore a rotation of this linker by ~180°
could bring the biotin into the BC active site from the CT active site (Fig. 4). The linker
from BCCP to AC1 (residues 770–795) is much longer and can accommodate such a
rotation, and part of this linker is disordered in the current structure.

We introduced mutations in the interfaces in the holoenzyme to assess the structural
information. The mutants that could be purified migrated at the same position on a gel
filtration column and had nearly the same thermal melting curves as the wild-type enzyme
(data not shown). Deletion of the α-helical hairpin (α8–α9, residues 940–972) in domain
AC1 (Extended Data Fig. 2) or the β4A–β4B loop in the C domain of CT (residues 1902–
1916, Extended Data Fig. 3) abolished the catalytic activity (Table 1), demonstrating their
importance in anchoring the hook of the BT domain (Fig. 2b). On the other hand, mutating
Gln608 in the hook, which interacts with the main chain of the β4A–β4B loop (Fig. 2b), had
little effect on catalysis. Similarly, the R656E mutation at the edge of the BT-BC interface
(Fig. 2a) had little effect, suggesting that these single-site mutations are not sufficient to
disrupt the holoenzyme or that these regions of contact do not contribute significantly to the
interactions.

Author Manuscript

We introduced the K73E, R76E and W487A mutation in the BC domain dimer interface
(Extended Data Fig. 7), and all three essentially abolished the catalytic activity (Table 1).
The mutations likely disrupted the BC domain dimer, and the domain changed to the other
conformation that is incompatible with catalysis. The K73E and R76E mutants are
equivalent to the R16E and R19E mutants of E. coli BC subunit that we characterized
earlier25,29. Those mutations greatly destabilized the dimer, but had only a small effect
(about 3-fold) on the catalytic activity of the BC subunit alone, likely because E. coli BC
monomer does not undergo the conformational transition as observed here for eukaryotic BC

(Fig. 3e). However, the R19E mutation had a much larger effect in vivo, likely in the context
of the E. coli ACC holoenzyme30.
Overall, our studies have produced the first structural information on the 500 kD yeast ACC
holoenzyme dimer. This structure is likely to have relevance for other eukaryotic ACCs,
especially the human ACC holoenzymes, as they share 45% sequence identity with yeast
ACC. The structures of the BC and CT domains of human and yeast ACCs are highly
similar, consistent with their strong sequence conservation (Extended Data Figs. 1, 3).
Although the sequence conservation for the central region is weaker, the secondary structure
elements in yeast ACC are predicted to be present in human ACC as well, and residues in
these secondary structure elements are more conserved than those in the loops (Extended
Data Fig. 2). Therefore, the overall structure of human ACC holoenzyme is likely to be
similar to that of yeast ACC.

Online Methods
Protein expression and purification
The N-terminal segment of the central region of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ACC (ScACC,
gene ACC1, residues 797–1033, AC1–2 domains) was expressed at 20 °C in E. coli
BL21(DE3) Star cells for native protein or B384(DE3) cells for selenomethionyl protein, in
the presence of a chaperone plasmid pG-KJE8 (TaKaRa). The recombinant protein carried a
C-terminal His-tag and was purified by Ni-NTA (Qiagen) and gel filtration chromatography
(Sephacryl S-300, GE Healthcare) in buffer A (20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, and 2
mM DTT).

Author Manuscript

The C-terminal segment of the central region of ScACC (residues 1036–1503, AC3–5
domains) was expressed in E.coli B834(DE3) cells at 25 °C for selenomethionyl protein and
purified following the same protocol. The gel filtration buffer contained 10 mM rather than 2
mM DTT.
The segment containing the BT-BCCP-AC domains of ScACC (residues 569–1494) was
expressed in BL21(DE3) Rosetta cells at 24 °C. The recombinant protein, with a C-terminal
His-tag, was purified by Ni-NTA and gel filtration chromatography in buffer A.

Author Manuscript

Full-length ScACC (residues 1–2233) was constructed into pET28a (Novagen) by sewing
together two PCR fragments with a 900-nt overlap. For structure determination, the segment
containing residues 22–2233, with a C-terminal His-tag, was expressed in E. coli
BL21(DE3) Star cells at 25 °C. Protein expression for all the different ScACC segments was
driven by the trp promoter and was induced with 3-indoleacrylic acid. However, the
endogenous E. coli biotin-protein ligase (BPL, also known as BirA) was not able to
biotinylate the ScACC. The ScBPL gene was amplified from the genome and inserted into
the pCDFDuet-1 vector (Novagen) multiple cloning site 2 without any affinity tag. Coexpression of ScBPL and the inclusion of 20 mg/l biotin in the media allowed complete
biotinylation of ScACC, confirmed by an avidin shift assay. The protein was purified by NiNTA and gel filtration chromatography in buffer A. Typically 0.5 mg of biotinylated ScACC
(or 3 mg of unbiotinylated ScACC) could be purified from 12 liters of culture.

Data collection and structure determination

Author Manuscript

X-ray diffraction data of AC1–2 domains were collected on an ADSC Q315 CCD at the
X29A beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS). The diffraction images
were processed with the HKL program31. The crystal belonged to space group P65 with cell
parameters of a = b = 117.6 Å, and c = 73.8 Å. There is a domain-swapped dimer of the
protein in the asymmetric unit. A selenomethionyl single-wavelength anomalous diffraction
(SAD) data set was collected to 3.0 Å resolution (wavelength 0.979 Å) and a native data set
to 2.5 Å resolution (wavelength 1.075 Å). Five Se atoms were located with program Solve32
and used for phasing with program Phenix33. The phase information was then extended to
2.5 Å with solvent flattening, histogram matching and two-fold non-crystallographic
symmetry (NCS) averaging using the program DM in CCP434. The atomic model was built
into the electron density map manually with the program Coot35. Structure refinement was
performed with CNS36 and Refmac537.

the protein in the asymmetric unit. The structures of AC1–2 and AC3–5 domains were used
as the search models to solve the structure by molecular replacement with the program
Phaser38. The BT and BCCP domains were manually built into the electron density map.
A native diffraction data set to 3.1 Å resolution of residues 22–2233 of un-biotinylated
ScACC was collected on a Pilatus 6M detector at the X25 beamline of NSLS (wavelength
1.100 Å). There is a dimer of ScACC in the asymmetric unit. The structure was solved by
molecular replacement with the program Phaser. The structures of AC1–2, AC3–5, and BT
domains reported here and previously published structures of yeast BC16 and CT domains17
were used as the search models. However, no electron density for the BCCP domain was
observed based on the crystallographic analysis.

A native diffraction data set to 3.2 Å resolution of biotinylated ScACC was collected at the
X25 beamline. The crystal belonged to space group P43212, with cell parameters of a = b =
159.8 Å, and c = 614.1 Å, isomorphous to that of the un-biotinylated ScACC. The final
atomic model was built with Coot and refined with Refmac5. NCS restraints were used
during the refinement. Crystals of full-length ScACC (residues 1–2233) did not diffract
beyond 8 Å resolution even after extensive efforts. The geometry of the final model was
validated with MolProbity39.
Mutagenesis and kinetic assays

Author Manuscript

Site-specific and deletion mutations were introduced with the QuikChange kit (Agilent) and
sequenced for confirmation. In deletion mutants, residues 940–972 of the α-helical hairpin
(α8–α9) in domain AC1 and residues 836–918 in domain AC2 were replaced by a (GS)3
linker, respectively, while residues 1902–1916 of the β4A–β4B loop in the C domain of CT
were replaced by a (GS)2 linker.
The catalytic activity of ACC was determined using a coupled enzyme assay, converting the
hydrolysis of ATP to the disappearance of NADH40. The reaction mixture contained 100
mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 8 mM MgCl2, 40 mM KHCO3, 200 mM KCl, 0.2 mM NADH, 0.5
mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.5 mM ATP, 6 units of lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma), 4 units
of pyruvate kinase, 100 nM ACC and various concentrations of acetyl-CoA. The absorbance
at 340 nm was monitored for 60 sec.

Electron density for various regions of the ScACC holoenzyme structure. (a). Schematic of
the two-step reaction in the catalysis by biotin-dependent carboxylases. Biotin is
carboxylated in the BC active site, and then translocates to the CT active site where the
substrate is carboxylated. The longest distance from the N1′ atom of biotin to the Cα atom
of the Lys residue covalently attached to biotin is ~16 Å, giving a reach of ~30 Å for biotin
(swinging-arm model). The actual distance between the BC and CT active sites are larger

Overall structure of the ScACC holoenzyme. (a). A large channel in the center of the ScACC
holoenzyme dimer. The view is related to that of Fig. 1b by an ~30° rotation around the
vertical axis. (b). Overlay of the structures of the two protomers of ScACC holoenzyme
dimer. One protomer is shown in color and other in gray. The overlay is based on the CT
domain. Differences in the orientations of the other domains are indicated, as well as the rms
distance for their equivalent Cα atoms. The arrow points to conformational differences in the
insert domain of CT, linked to differences in the BCCP binding mode. (c). Overlay of the BT
domain of ScACC (in orange) and the BT domain of PCC (in gray). The ‘hook’, connecting
the end of the helix (αV) to the first strand of the β-barrel (β22), is labeled. The last three
strands of the β-barrel (β27–β29) are splayed further away from the central helix in ScACC
compared to PCC. (d). Interactions between the hook of the BT domain and the β4A–β4B
loop from the C domain of CT, an inserted segment that projects away from the rest of the
domain. (e). The BCCP-AC1 linker has hydrophobic interactions with the top of one side of
the BT domain β-barrel. The disordered segment of the linker is indicated with the blue line.

Structure of the CT domain dimer of ScACC. (a). Overlay of the CT domain dimer in the
ScACC holoenzyme (cyan and yellow for N and C domains of protomer 1, light cyan and
light yellow for protomer 2) in complex with CoA (black) with the CT domain alone in
complex with CoA (gray). Biotin is shown in black and BCCP is omitted for clarity. The
bound position of the CP-640186 inhibitor (gold) is shown for reference. A conformational
change for the insert domain at the top is due to the binding of BCCP in the holoenzyme,
while the insert domain at the bottom shows essentially no change because the BCCP-biotin
is not bound as deeply into this active site. (b). Overlay of the CT active site (cyan and
yellow) of ScACC holoenzyme with that of CT alone in complex with CoA (gray). The
CP-640186 inhibitor (gold) clashes with the bound position of biotin (black). The thiol
