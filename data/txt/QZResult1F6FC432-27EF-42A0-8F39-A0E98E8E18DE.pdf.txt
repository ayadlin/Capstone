Letter to the Editor
Because meaningful differences exist in regard to chemistry, bioavailability, and metabolism, it may be imprudent to connect data
gathered with dehydroascorbic acid to vitamin C (ascorbate) and
oral supplements. Numerous randomized human clinical trials
have not shown decreased chemotherapeutic efficacy with dietary
supplement usage, including vitamin C (8). Scientific dialogue on
the subject may benefit from further preclinical testing of oral
vitamin C (ascorbate) supplementation and cancer treatment in
addition to experiments deigned solely with dehydroascorbic acid.

Comment re: Vitamin C Antagonizes
the Cytotoxic Effects
of Chemotherapy

To the Editor:
On the basis of cell and animal experiments with dehydroascorbic acid, Heaney and colleagues state, “These results suggest that
supplementary vitamin C may have adverse consequences in
patients receiving cancer therapy” (1). Selectively referring to dehydroascorbic acid as vitamin C throughout the majority of this work
may send a clouded message to patients and their caregivers. All
known actions of vitamin C are mediated by the reduced molecule
ascorbate, not the oxidized molecule dehydroascorbic acid. Mice
lacking the tissue transport protein specific for ascorbate (Slc23a2)
do not survive because of severe vitamin C deficiency, despite having no impairments in dehydroascorbic acid transport (2).
The suggestion that “…study conditions were relevant to clinical
conditions” (1) should be viewed cautiously. Compared with cells
devoid of any ascorbate, researchers attenuated cytotoxicity to
antineoplastic agents in vitro (11-27%) by prior treatment with
500 μmol/L dehydroascorbic acid, which rapidly elevated intracellular ascorbate concentrations up to 18 mmol/L within 1 hour (1).
In vivo, numerous reductive systems ensure plasma concentrations
of dehydroascorbic acid do not exceed 1 μmol/L (3, 4). Although
alluded to, the actual level of dehydroascorbic acid formed endogenously within the oxidative environments of tumors was not
measured in either this (1) or the previous studies cited by this
group (5, 6). Most cells in vivo, including cancer cells, maintain a
constant intracellular ascorbate concentration of 1 to 5 mmol/L,
which never decreases to zero. Data collected in vitro by comparing
two extremes, 0 and 18 mmol/L ascorbate for instance, are implausible with regard to tumors and other tissues in general. The investigators conclude that “This finding could have important clinical
relevance given the wide use of vitamin C as a nutritional supplement” (1). However, to produce an effect in xenografted mice, a
course of 8 × 250 mg/kg dehydroascorbic acid was administered
intravenously (1). This regimen does not simulate oral ingestion
of vitamin C supplements. In fact, irreversible diabetes can be induced in rats after intravenous injection of 700 mg/kg dehydroascorbic acid (7).
