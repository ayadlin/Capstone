Abstract
The restriction of anti-cancer drugs entry to tumor sites in the brain is a major
impediment to the development of new strategies for the treatment of glioma. Based
on the finding that macrophages possess an intrinsic homing property enabling them
to migrate to tumor sites across the endothelial barriers in response to the excretion
of cytokines/chemokines in the diseased tissues, we exploited macrophages as ‘Trojan
horses’ to carry drug-loading nanoparticles (NPs), pass through barriers, and offload
them into brain tumor sites. Anticancer drugs were encapsulated in nanoparticles to
avoid their damage to the cells. Drug loading NPs was then incubated with RAW264.7
cells in vitro to prepare macrophage-NPs (M-NPs). The release of NPs from M-NPs
was very slow in medium of DMEM and 10% FBS and significantly accelerated when
LPS and IFN-γ were added to mimic tumor inflammation microenvironment. The
viability of macrophages was not affected when the concentration of doxorubicin
lower than 25 μg/ml. The improvement of cellular uptake and penetration into the
core of glioma spheroids of M-NPs compared with NPs was verified in in vitro studies.
The tumor-targeting efficiency of NPs was also significantly enhanced after loading
into macrophages in nude mice bearing intracranial U87 glioma. Our results provided
great potential of macrophages as an active biocarrier to deliver anticancer drugs to
the tumor sites in the brain and improve therapeutic effects of glioma.

INTRODUCTION

progression of glioma into later stage, the integrity of
BBB is compromised due to enhanced permeability
and retention (EPR) effect [7]. However, the increased
interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) inside the tumor and the
blood tumor barrier (BTB) still impede therapeutic agents
into tumor [8, 9]. Only by overcoming these barriers, the
drug could be successfully delivered into the diseased site.
Recently, multifunctional nano-drug delivery systems have
been developed to improve therapeutic effect of different
drugs [10], but rapid clearance from blood, limited
targeting to diseased tissues and serious immunogenicity
seriously restricted their application in tumor therapy.
To our knowledge, when inflammation happens,
leukocyte will be mobilized from bone marrow into
circulation and move into inflammatory site. Some
studies have exploited this pathological property
to design cell-based drug delivery system. For

The treatment of glioma is one of the greatest
challenges in cancer therapy [1]. Despite the substantial
progress of current treatment strategies in recent decades,
the prolongation of glioma patients’ survival has not been
efficiently achieved [2]. Since infiltrative growth of glioma
leads to incomplete surgical excision [3], radiotherapy and
chemotherapy are necessary following surgery. Therefore,
how to deliver drugs into tumor site represents one of the
most important obstacles during the treatment of glioma.
In the early stage of glioma, an endothelial cell
monolayer associated with pericytes and astrocytes
constitutes the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which protects
brain tissue from harmful substances in blood circulation
[4–6]. Meanwhile, it prevents therapeutic drugs from
entering the brain to treat various diseases. With the

instance, monocytes were used as drug carrier to treat
atherosclerosis with high efficiency [11]. As with other
inflammatory responses, inflammation in the brain is also
characterized by extensive leukocytes infiltration into
brain tissue by cell diapedesis and chemotaxis [12–14].
Brynskikh et al. utilized macrophage as a drug vehicle
to improve the delivery of redox enzymes into the brain
for neuroprotection of dopaminergic neurons in a mouse
model of Parkinson’s disease. Therapeutic efficacy of
macrophages loaded with nanozyme was confirmed by
twofold reductions in microgliosis and twofold increase
in tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing dopaminergic
neurons [15].
Rudolf Virchow identified the presence of
leukocytes within tumors for the first time in the 19th
century, which indicated a possible link between
inflammation and cancer [16]. Inflammation is a critical
component in the progression of tumor, including
initiation, promotion, invasion and metastasis [16, 17].
A larger number of immune cells, mainly macrophages
and T cells, are recruited into tumor microenvironments.
It has been reported that macrophages constitute
up to a third of the whole tumor mass in glioma
[18]. Additionally, hypoxia is the hallmark feature
of most solid tumors due to their rapid growth and
poorly organized vasculature. Such hypoxic pressure
impedes the penetration of anticancer drugs into tumor
tissues. Therefore, the hypoxic regions in tumor are
usually resistant to radio-and chemotherapy [19, 20].
Interestingly, the chemoattractant released by tumor cells
in response to hypoxia attract macrophages infiltration
into tumor tissues [21, 22]. Huang et al. employed bone
marrow-derived monocytes to deliver polymer bubbles
and vesicles for chemotherapy of tumor hypoxia [23].
Inspired by these understandings, a novel strategy
utilizing macrophage as a carrier to migrate across the
BBB, BBTB and home into tumor sites is conceived.
Importantly, macrophages are able to carry drugs into
brain tumor throughout the whole progress.
In this manuscript, RAW264.7, a kind of mouse
macrophage-like cell line with similar functions to
primary macrophage cells, were used here to demonstrate
the feasibility of macrophage as vehicle to deliver drug
into glioma. Figure 1 illustrates schematic strategy
adopted in this work for the construction of M-NPs and
in vivo fate. A fluorescent dye, coumarin-6, and a near
infrared dye, DiR, were respectively encapsulated to
quantitatively or qualitatively track the behavior of a
macrophage based drug delivery system. The stability
of this system and its release kinetics in a simulated
inflammatory environment was studied. Avascular
U87 glioma spheroids were employed to explore the
penetration ability of M-NPs system. The tumor targeting
capacity of this system was validated in orthotopic U87
glioma bearing mice model by in vivo imaging system,
and the brain distribution was evaluated by confocal
microscopy in frozen brain slices.

Characterization of nanoparticles
In order to study the effect of particle size on the
uptake efficiency of macrophages, nanoparticles in three
sizes (50–100 nm, 100–200 nm, 200–300 nm) were
prepared by emulsion-solvent evaporation method. The
particle size, Zeta potential and polydispersity index (PDI)
of the nanoparticles were listed in Table 1. Encapsulation
of coumarin-6, DiR did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the
characteristics of nanoparticles. Owing to the water
solubility of doxorubicin hydrochloride, the DOX-NPs
were prepared by double-emulsion method. The size, zeta
potential and PDI of DOX-NPs is 141.6 nm, -31.7mv and
0.086, respectively.

Effect of particle size on macrophages uptake
Macrophages itself could efficiently phagocytize
nanoparticles by endocytosis. The size of NPs influences
the phagocytosis capacity of macrophages greatly.
Coumarin-6 was used as fluorescent probe to investigate
the cellular uptake characteristics. As illustrated in
Figure  2, qualitative fluorescent images showed that
macrophages incubated with 100–200 nm NPs exhibited
the highest fluorescence intensity among three types of
NPs under the same incubation conditions. Quantitatively,
the cellular uptake of 100–200 nm NPs was1.56 and
2.0 fold of the uptake efficiency of 50–100 nm and
200–300 nm NPs, respectively.

Effect of DOX-NPs loading on macrophages
viability
The function of macrophage as carrier is strongly
correlated with its viability after the loading of DOX-NPs.
Macrophages showed reduced viability after incubation
with 10, 25, and 50 μg/ml free DOX. Whereas, incubation
with DOX-NPs resulted in higher viability than that of free
DOX under the same concentration (Figure 3). Hence, in
a certain concentration range of DOX, DOX-NPs was
successfully loaded with low toxicity into macrophages,
leading us to conclude that macrophages would be a
useful candidate as a biocarrier to deliver nanodrugs. It
is worthwhile to note that the incubation concentration
of NPs and cell viability should be carefully balanced
because high drug concentration may cause toxicity to
macrophages.

Release profile of NPs from macrophages
DiR was used to track the release profile of NPs
from macrophages. The cells were pre-loaded with
nanoparticles for 2 hours, then washed with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in fresh media for
different time intervals (0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h).

Tumor targeting of M-NPs

The media was collected and the fluorescence intensity
was measured by fluorospectro photometer. Sustained
release of DiR-NPs from macrophages was observed and
achieved cumulative release of 42% after 24 h incubation
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Meanwhile,
a faster release pattern was obtained (71%) in DMEM
containing 10% FBS with addition of LPS and IFN-γ
(Figure 4), which indicated that drug release would be
accelerated in tumor microenvironment.

To determine the biodistribution of NPs and M-NPs,
in vivo imaging was conducted to track the particles in
nude mice bearing intracranial U87 glioma. Both the
NPs and M-NPs could apparently accumulate in the
tumor tissues from 0.5 h after injection (data not shown).
However, the fluorescence intensity of M-NPs treated
mice was much higher than that of NPs treated mice at
all-time points from 2 to 24 h (Figure 6), indicating that
macrophage as cell carrier significantly improved the
tumor-targeting efficiency of NPs. Correspondingly, the
conclusion was further confirmed by ex vivo imaging of
the brains.

In vitro glioma spheroid penetration of M-NPs
In vitro U87 glioma spheroids model was established
to evaluate the penetration ability of M-NPs. After 12 h
incubation, M-NPs showed more extensive infiltration
into tumor spheroids than NPs. M-NPs could reach about
56.42 μm away from the rim of the spheroids, and was
1.56 fold deeper than that of NPs which penetrated only
36.07 μm into glioma spheroids (Figure 5A, 5C). Multilevel scanning from the top of the glioma spheroid with an
interval 20 μm into the core showed that the fluorescence
intensity of M-NPs treatment is higher than that of
NPs (Figure 5B, 5D). Therefore, nanoparticles loaded
in macrophage could not only facilitate the uptake by
tumor cells, but also enhance their penetration into tumor
spheroids.

In vivo tumor localization of M-NPs
Three weeks after glioma cell inoculation, in vivo
brain distribution of coumarin 6-labeled NPs and M-NPs
was measured 12 h after intravenous administration into
mice. As shown in Figure 7, there was only a little green
fluorescence distributed in glioma tissues in NPs group.
but in the case of the M-NPs group, an obvious stronger
fluorescent signal was detected and a much deeper
permeation was observed at the glioma parenchyma. The
results indicated that macrophage as carrier can increase
the accumulation of NPs in brain tumor.

When tumor occurs, the tumor inflammation
environment could induce the overexpression of the
cell adhesion moleculars (CAMs) on the surface of
endothelial cell monolayer, which mediate interaction
between macrophages and endothelial cells, facilitate the
initial process of macrophage rolling, firm attachment
to endothelium and transmigration [28, 29]. Meanwhile,
there are accumulating evidences showing that a larger
number of macrophages are attracted and retained in
hypoxia regions by local synthesis of chemoattractant
in tumor cells undergoing hypoxia due to rapid tumor
growth [20, 21]. We compared the chemotactic ability
of unactivated RAW264.7 and activated RAW264.7
by boyden chamber method. The migration rate of
unactivated and activated RAW264.7 is 9.28 ± 0.54% and
11.06 ± 0.53%, respectively. No significant difference was

During the progression of glioma, tumor tissues are
protected by BBB, BBTB and high IFP, which make the
parenchyma inaccessible to therapeutic drugs [4, 7, 8].
Nanoparticle drug delivery systems with active targeting
capabilities have been explored for enhancing drug
delivery to glioma by conjugating target moiety onto the
surface of nanoparticles [24, 25]. In recent decades, cell
based drug delivery systems take advantage of circulatory
cell (red blood cell, T cell, macrophage, antigen presenting
cell, etc.) to improve the therapeutic effect of anti-cancer
drugs [15, 26, 27]. Using cells as carriers for drug delivery
offers several advantages over free drug, including
improved drug efficacy, extended half-lives, sustained
drug release, and limited immunogenicity and cytotoxicity.

found between them. Therefore, unactivated RAW264.7
cell line was chosen in this manuscript.
If free anticancer drugs are encapsulated into
cells, it may cause damage to the carrier itself before
arriving at tumor sites and suppress the functions
of cells as transporter. Therefore, we encapsulated
anticancer drugs into nanoparticles with the purpose to
reduce the damage of the drug to the cell carriers [30].
As illustrated in Figure 2, CCK8 assay showed that the
viability of macrophages incubated with NPs-DOX was
higher than those incubated with free DOX. By blocking
direct contact between the cell and the drug, DOX-NPs
efficiently reduced drug-induced cellular toxicity. The
properties of nanoparticles, such as size, shape, chemical
functionality and surface charge, are closely related to the
uptake capacity of macrophages [31]. Nanoparticles in
three sizes were prepared by the same method using the
same materials. Under identical conditions, 100–200 nm
nanoparticles are easily  internalized by macrophages
compared with other two particles of different size,
and the loading of NPs did not affect the migration of
macrophages into tumor tissues [32].
Experiments performed on 3D glioma spheroids
investigated the migratory potential of macrophages

loaded with nanoparticles. Tumor cells in spheroids
display higher resistance to radio- and chemotherapy
than monolayer tumor cells, and are thought to mimic
tumor nodes well prior to vascularization in vivo [33, 34].
As illustrated in Figure 5, NPs loaded macrophages
infiltration toward spheroids was observed to be 1.5fold deeper penetration into the spheroids than free
NPs. These results demonstrated that macrophage as an
anticancer agent transporter could enhance drug delivery
in inaccessible tumor hypoxic region effectively.
In vivo imaging experiments were performed to
evaluate the behavior of M-NPs in nude mice bearing
intracranial U87 glioma. The accumulation of NPs in
tumors via passive EPR effect was limited, while M-NPs
exhibited a significant superiority in glioma targeting with
high fluorescent intensity at all-time points. Consistently,
in frozen brain sections, the accumulation of NPs was
low and located on the border of glioma. However,
M-NPs showed an extensive distribution and deep
penetration into glioma parenchyma, indicating circulating
macrophages could overcome the barriers (BBB, BBTB,
IFP) and penetrate into the tumor tissue. The major organs,
including heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and brain, were
harvested 24 hours after the administration of M-NPs and

imaged under ex vivo fluorescence. The results illustrated
in Figure 6B showed that there were some differences in
tissues distribution between NPs and M-NPs, especially
in the lung, which might due to pulmonary capillaries
retention of macrophages.
It was reported that therapeutically meaningful
amount of free DOX could be loaded into the RAW264.7
cells by short time incubation, About 65% of the drug
were released from the cells in the first 2 h [35]. Less than
20% and only 42% NPs were released from preloaded
macrophages after 2 h and 24 h incubation respectively,
indicating the sustained release of NPs from macrophages.
The release of drug from macrophages is a complicated
process. Based on the results of our study and literature
[13, 35, 36], we speculated that the drug could be released
from macrophages in two ways. Firstly, NPs was excreted
from macrophages by exocytosis, and the free drug
diffused from NPs into extracellular medium subsequently.
Secondly, the free drug might be released from NPs within
cells, and then diffuse into the surroundings via passive
driving force caused by concentration gradient between
cells and surroundings, or the multi-drug resistant proteins
P-gp expressed in the macrophage could pump the drug
out of the cells. The former plays a dominant role in the
process. Once NPs loading macrophages enter into the

tumor sites, tumor inflammation environment will activate
macrophages and result in significant increase in drug
release from macrophages. It was found that when the cell
carrier enters into diseased site in Parkinson’s disease,
the direct contact between cell carrier and endothelial,
neuronal and glial cells promote drug transfer through
endocytosis-independent mechanism, which mainly
involve fusion of cell membranes, bridging conduits and
nanoparticle lipid coating [37]. Therefore, it is supposed
that the increased nanoparticles transfer might be occurred
in a similar way after macrophage being attracted into
tumor tissue. The inner of tumor tissue is filled with
inflammatory cytokines [16, 17]. In order to mimic the
inflammatory microenvironment in tumor tissue, LPS and
IFN-γ were added to the medium according to previous
reports [42, 43]. When LPS and IFN-γ were added,
they would bind with Toll-like receptor 4 and IFN-γ
receptor expressed on macrophage respectively, activate
RAW264.7 and finally promote drug release by exocytosis.
The study demonstrated the feasibility of using
macrophages as carriers for targeting anticancer drug into
glioma. Considering that the M2 phenotype macrophage
in tumor promotes tumor growth and contributes to tumor
angiogenesis, its migration into tumor would weaken the
effect of anticancer agents [38], the M1 type macrophage

tumor progression. Our ultimate goal is to encapsulate
nanodrugs into patient derived M1 type macrophage,
then transfer the macrophage-NPs back into the patient to
achieve improved efficacy and to reduce immune responses.

the emulsion was dispersed into 18 ml of corresponding
concentration of sodium cholate aqueous solution under
rapid magnetic stirring for 60 min. After evaporating
dichloromethane with a ZX-98 rotary evaporator
(LOOYE, China) at 40°C, the suspensions were
centrifuged using a TJ-25 centrifuge (Beckman Counter,
USA). After discarding the supernatant, the obtained
nanoparticles were re-suspended with 0. 1 M PBS buffer
(pH 7.4) and stored at 4°C for further use.
DOX·HCL loaded nanoparticles were prepared
by the double/emulsion method as previously reported
[40,  41]. 20 mg PLGA was dissolved in 1 ml of ethyl
acetate followed by addition of 100 μl of DOX·HCL
(10  mg/ml), the first emulsion was formed by tip
sonication in ice bath, to which 2 ml of 2% PVA was added
immediately followed by sonication in ice bath to finally
form double emulsion. The emulsion was dispersed into
9 ml of 2%PVA with magnetic stirring in room temperature
(600 rpm) for 2 hours. The organic solvent was removed by
vacuum evaporation at 40°C for 20min. The residues were
concentrated by centrifugation using a TJ-25 centrifuge.
The physiochemical parameters of NPs, including
particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity were measured
using a dynamic light scattering detector (Zetasizer, NanoZS, Malvern, UK).

Cell culture

Preload of NPs in macrophages

RAW264.7 cell lines, obtained from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences Cells Bank (Shanghai, China), were
cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 1%
antibiotics and 1% nonessential amino acids at 37°C, 5%
CO2, and 95% humidity in a CO2 incubator.

RAW264.7 were seeded into 12-well plates at
a density of 2 × 104 cells/ml. 24 h later, the cells were
incubated with 200 ng/mL coumarin-6-loaded NPs in three
particle sizes (50–100 nm, 100–200 nm, 200–300 nm)
respectively in the absence of FBS for 2 h (n = 3).
After being rinsed with PBS three times, the cells were
harvested and probe sonicated in ice bath, then centrifuged
at 8000 rpm for 10min. The supernatant is collected. One
half was measured for protein concentration, the other
for fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence intensity
was normalized for protein content and expressed in
fluorescence intensity per mg of protein. Meanwhile,
the pre-loaded cells were washed three times with PBS
and observed under fluorescent microscopy (Leica,
DMI4000D, Germany) immediately.

Animals

PLGA nanoparticles in three sizes loaded with
fluorescent dye were prepared by emulsion/solvent
evaporation method according to the procedure reported
previously [39]. The particle size could be controlled
by adjusting PLGA amount, emulsifier concentration,
ultrasonic time. Briefly, 5 mg, 20 mg, 150 mg PLGA and
100 μl coumarin 6 (1 mg/ml) or 10 μl DiR (5 mg/ml)
were dissolved in 1 ml dichloromethane respectively, to
which 2 ml of different concentration (0.05%, 0.5%, 2.0%
respectively) of sodium cholate aqueous solution was
added, with the mixture sonicated on ice using a probe
sonicator (Scientz Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China). Then

5 × 103 RAW264.7 in 100 μl medium were cultured
into each well of a 96-well plate. Free DOX·HCL or
DOX-NPs were then added at concentrations 2, 10, 25 and
50 μg/ml. Macrophages were incubated with DOX or DOXNPs for 12 h. At the end of incubation, the culture medium
was discarded and the cells were washed with PBS. Cell

with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, and dehydrated
using 15% glucose in PBS followed by 30% glucose
in PBS. Then the tumors were embedded in Tissue Tek
O.C.T. compound, frozen at −80°C and sectioned as slides
at 5 μm thicknesses. The slides were subjected to confocal
microscopy analysis after stained with DAPI for 10 min
and rinsed with PBS.

with ice-cold PBS, The NPs loaded macrophages were
incubated with two different fresh release media, DMEM
(no phenol red) and 10% FBS, DMEM (no phenol red)
and 10% FBS with 500 ng/ml LPS and 200 ng/ml IFN-γ,
respectively (n = 3). LPS and IFN-γ were added to
mimic tumor inflammation microenvironment to activate
RAW264.7 [42, 43]. The media was collected at various
time intervals. The levels of fluorescence were measured
on a Shimadzu RF5000 fluorescent spectrophotometer.
