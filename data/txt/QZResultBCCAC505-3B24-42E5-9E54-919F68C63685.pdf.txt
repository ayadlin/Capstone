BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced malignancies for whom standard therapy is ineffective may participate in phase 1 trials. To gain a better understanding of the clinical features that could influence benefit versus risk, the authors of this report assessed prognostic factors and survival for patients who were referred
to a phase 1 clinic focused primarily on targeted agents. METHODS: The medical records of 200 sequential
patients who presented to the Phase 1 Clinic at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center were
reviewed, and their characteristics and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: The median patient age was 58
years (range, 12-85 years), and 57% of patients were men. The median number of prior therapies was 4. Of
200 patients, 182 were treated on at least 1 phase 1 clinical trial. The median follow-up of surviving patients
was 21 months, and the median overall survival was 9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.4-10.8). In
univariate analysis, the factors that predicted shorter survival were primary tumor in the gastrointestinal
tract; a history of thrombosis, liver metastases, and elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase; platelet count; carbohydrate antigen 9 (Ca19-9) and Ca-125 levels; aspartate aminotransferase levels, and alkaline phosphatase levels (P < .05 for each). In multivariate analysis, independent factors that predicted
shorter survival were a history of thromboembolism (hazard ratio [HR], 2.38; 95% CI, 1.29-4.39; P ¼ .005),
platelets 440  109/L (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.12-2.65; P ¼ .014), and the presence of liver metastases (HR, 1.51;
95% CI, 1.09-2.09; P ¼ .013). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who were referred to phase 1 studies had a short median survival (9 months). Patients with thrombocytosis, liver metastases, and a history of thromboembolism

Numerous new anticancer agents, especially targeted molecules, are entering clinical trials. During
the last 2 decades, our understanding of the fundamental biologic basis of cancer has grown exponentially,
and a large number of molecularly targeted agents have entered the clinic. Many of these agents appear to
have fewer side effects than cytotoxic chemotherapy, and their development plan may differ, with an emphasis on understanding target impact.

By definition, patients who participate in these trials
have exhausted conventional evidence-based treatment.
Phase 1 oncology trials include first-in-human studies as
well as studies that combine 2 or more experimental or
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
drugs for the first time. Their objectives are to evaluate the
safety, pharmacokinetic properties, and pharmacodynamic properties of these agents; to establish an optimal
dose for phase 2 efficacy trials; to describe initial antitumor response; and to gain information about the effect of
a targeted agent on its target.1,2 These trials, therefore,
form the vital link between the preclinical setting and subsequent definitive trials determining efficacy. How
patients fare on such trials and whether there are clinical
characteristics that may influence patient selection, consequently, is an important issue.3 Previous studies have suggested that physicians tend to make overly optimistic
estimates of the survival of patients with advanced cancer,
so that objective parameters may improve prognostic accuracy.4,5 For that reason, we assessed survival outcomes
and prognostic variables to determine their utility for predicting the outcomes of such patients. Herein, we report
our experience with 200 patients who were seen in consultation by personnel in the Phase 1 Clinic of the Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at The
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (M.
D. Anderson). We observed that the median survival was
short (9 months) and that thrombocytosis, liver metastases, and a history of thromboembolism were adverse prognostic features. By using these covariates, a score for
predicting survival is proposed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We searched an electronic database of 200 consecutive
patients with advanced malignancies who presented to M.
D. Anderson Phase 1 Program starting in September
2004. Patients were referred to the clinic by other M. D.
Anderson physicians or by oncologists from outside the
institute, or they were self-referred. All referrals were triaged by a specialized nurse who provided physicians and/
or patients with general eligibility criteria for specific
studies.
All patient records were reviewed to determine clinical characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes. A
waiver of informed consent for chart review and analysis
1092

was granted by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The
patients who were included in this retrospective analysis
had a broad range of primary tumor types. They each had
received at least the standard of care for their specific tumor types, except for a few patients who had disease with
no available, reasonable, conventional treatment
regimens.
Presenting characteristics and laboratory tests performed at the time of presentation in the Phase 1 Clinic
were assessed. Staging evaluations included complete
physical examinations and computed tomography scans
of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and other imaging studies, depending on the protocol requirement. Slides and
available tumor tissue were reviewed by an M. D. Anderson pathologist. Baseline assessment with laboratory and
radiographic testing was performed within an appropriate
window of the first consultation visit (1 month) and
before beginning treatment on a phase 1 trial. Investigational treatment was administered at our center, and IRB
approval and consent was obtained before administration
of an investigational agent.

Endpoints and Statistical Methods
All statistical analyses were performed by our biostatisticians (S.L. and L.F.). The primary endpoint of the current
study was overall survival, which was measured from the
time of presentation to the Phase 1 Program at M. D.
Anderson until death from any cause or last follow-up.
The overall survival rates were calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method and were compared among prognostic factor groups using the log-rank test. An intentionto-treat analysis was used with regard to survival analysis,
ie, all patients who were referred to the Phase 1 Program
during the allotted time were included in this analysis,
regardless of whether or not they received treatment. Cox
proportional hazard regression models were used for the
multivariate analysis. The final model selected was based
on the clinical importance of the prognostic factors.
Thirty-four covariates were analyzed in univariate analysis, including age, sex, race, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status,6 body mass
index, primary tumor, history of smoking, number of
comorbidities, type of comorbidity (hypertension, arrhythmia, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, thrombosis),
location of metastatic sites (liver, lung, pleural effusion,

bone, brain, lymph nodes, bulky abdominal metastases),
prior radiofrequency ablation to the liver, history of radiation to brain, family history of cancer, and serum studies
(lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], platelets, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine), time on treatment before phase 1,
time on previous treatment before phase 1, and total number of treatment regimens before phase 1. Standard tumor
markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen
125 [Ca-125], Ca19-9, and Ca27.29) also were analyzed
when available. The above variables were measured at the
time of presentation to the Phase 1 Program. All tests
were 2-sided, and a P value <.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using
the software S Plus (version 7.0; Insightful Corp., Seattle,
Wash).

RESULTS
Patients
Two hundred consecutive patients were identified who
were seen at the clinic. Pretreatment characteristics are listed
in Table 1. The median age was 58 years (range, 12-85
years), and 48.5% of patients were aged 60 years. There
was a slight preponderance of men (57%). The ECOG performance status was 0 in 41% of patients, 1 in 52.5% of
patients, and 2 in 6.5% of patients. Overall, 159 patients
(79.5%) had at least 1 comorbidity at presentation to the
Phase 1 Clinic (history of thromboembolism, hypertension,
arrhythmia, coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction, diabetes, thyroid disease) (Table 2). Eleven patients
had received no prior therapy (because of the unavailability
of reasonable, conventional therapy for their disease).
Among 188 patients who had received at least 1 prior treatment, the median number of prior treatments was 4 (mean,
5 prior treatments). The most common primary tumor site
was the gastrointestinal tract (33%). Details of the tumor
types and sites are listed in Table 1. The median time from
initial consultation in the Phase 1 Clinic to Day 1 of treatment on a phase 1 trial was 15 days.

Treatments
Of 200 patients, 182 received treatment on at least 1
phase 1 trial (range, 1-8 treatments). The reasons that
Cancer

March 1, 2009

patients did not receive treatment included screen failure,
complications from or progression of disease, patient refusal, and insurance issues. Sixty-six patients (33%) were
treated on more than 1 trial.
Patients initially were treated on 1 of 36 phase 1 trials that were available at the time of referral. Nineteen of
these (53%) were first-in-human trials. These regimens
included a single, targeted compound (20 trials; 56% of
trials); trials of combinations of 2 targeted agents (some
already approved by the FDA; 4 trials; 11% of trials); targeted agents in combination with cytotoxic therapy (5 trials; 14% of trials); cytotoxic agents only (4 trials; 11% of
trials); and regional therapy using cytotoxic agents with or
without targeted agents (3 trials; 8% of trials).

Survival
Among 200 patients, there were 156 deaths as of the time
of the current report. The median follow-up of surviving
patients was 21.3 months, and the median survival was 9
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.4-10.8 months)
(Fig. 1a). The survival rates at 6 months, 12 months, and
18 months were 67%, 40%, and 25%, respectively.
Univariate analysis results for survival by pretreatment characteristics are shown in Table 2. The factors
that were associated with shorter survival were a history of
thromboembolism, elevated LDH, elevated alkaline phosphatase, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (P < .001 for
all); elevated Ca-125 (P ¼ .004), elevated Ca19-9 (P ¼
.005), elevated platelets (P ¼ .008), the presence of liver
metastases (P ¼ .02), and a primary gastrointestinal tumor (P < .001). Patients who had received >5 prior treatments had a trend toward shorter survival (P ¼ .058).

Independent Prognostic Factors for
Survival and the Prognostic Factor Model
In a multivariate analysis (Cox model), independent factors that predicted shorter survival were a history of
thromboembolism (P ¼ .005), the presence of liver metastases (P ¼ .013), and elevated platelets counts (P ¼
.014) (Table 3, Fig. 1b-d). The sample of 200 patients
comprised the population that was used to build a prognostic score. The 3 pretreatment parameters that retained
independent significance in the multivariate analysis (Table 3) were used to design a model with which to predict

an individual patient’s risk of death. Because the relative
risks associated with each of the independently significant
risk factors were comparable (Table 3), the relative risk of
death could be characterized by summing the number of
risk factors present at the first visit to the Phase 1 Clinic.
Risk groups were defined by comparing the relative risk of
death in patients with each possible number of presenting
risk factors (0, 1, 2 or 3) and combining categories with
similar risks (eg, 2 with 3). Patients then were assigned to
1 of 3 risk groups on the basis of their number of presenting risk factors: 0, low risk; 1, intermediate risk; 2 or 3,
high risk. The survival curves and death rates over time for
the 3 risk groups are shown in Figure 2). At 6 months,
73%, 65%, and 35% of patients with 0, 1, 2 or 3 risk fac1094

tors, respectively, were expected to remain alive. The
respective rates at 12 months were 51%, 34%, and 6%
(P < .001). The median survival was 12.3 months for
patients with 0 risk factors, 8 months for patients with 1
risk factor, and 5.2 months for patients with 2 or 3 risk
factors). Initially, patients who had scores of 0, 1, or 2 or 3
appeared to have similar survival, but their survival curves
separated after the first 4.7 months.

This is the first study to report on the survival of patients
treated on phase 1 trials in which the majority of therapeutic agents were biologic/targeted therapies. The

median overall survival from the time of referral to the
Phase 1 Clinic of our patient population was 9 months
(95% CI, 7.4-10.8 months), which was almost twice as
long as that reported for patients treated on phase 1 trials
with cytotoxic agents (5 months).5 With a median followup of 21 months for surviving patients, the survival rates
at 6 months and 12 months were 67% and 40%, respectively. These results suggest that the prognosis of patients
who are referred for phase 1 trials in the era of targeted
therapy, although it remains poor, is better than that
described in earlier reports.5 Many of the patients who
were seen in our clinic remained well enough to participate in 2 or more consecutive phase 1 trials. Indeed, 66 of
our 200 patients participated in more than 1 phase 1 trial.
These data offset a traditionally nihilistic view of the
patient base for phase 1 oncology studies, suggesting a
more robust population than had been posited previously.
It is not clear whether the differences in survival between
our study and previous studies are because of the type of
therapy used or the characteristics of the patients who initially were referred. It is possible that patients who survive
long enough to be seen in a phase 1 clinic have a more indolent disease course. Further elucidation of molecular
subtypes of disease will clarify this question. In addition,
phase 1 clinical trials typically select patients who have an
ECOG performance status of 2. Therefore, interpretation of these results should be viewed in the context of
patient selection by acceptable performance status.
The ability of clinicians to predict survival accurately
in terminally ill cancer patients historically has been

unreliable, and even experienced physicians overestimate
survival.4 Therefore, there is a need for objective parameters to help predict outcome. Of 10 variables that we
measured at baseline at the initial consultation in our
Phase 1 Clinic that were associated with shorter survival
on univariate analysis (Table 2), 3 variables emerged as independently predictive of decreased survival in multivariate analyses. These were a history of thromboembolism,
elevated platelet counts, and liver metastases (Table 3)
(Fig. 1b,c,d). In an earlier study of prognostic factors for
patients with cancer who were placed on protocols primarily evaluating cytotoxic agents, independent poor
prognostic features were a compromised performance status (ECOG 2 or 3) and an elevated LDH.5 Although
LDH was a prognostic feature in univariate analysis in our
patients as well, it did not reach significance in multivariate analysis. The small number of patients in our study
with poor performance status available (ECOG 2, 6.5%
of patients; ECOG 3, no patients) probably accounts for
the lack of influence of this factor. Consistent with our
results, Seidenfeld et al3 recently reported that the majority of patients (93%) who were participating in National
Cancer Institute-sponsored phase 1 trials had a near-normal performance status. The factors that we identified in
the current study also differed from those selected for prediction of poor outcome in a multivariate analysis of cancer patients in the palliative care setting4: brain
metastases, poor performance status, strong analgesics,
dyspnea, elevated LDH, and leukocytosis. These differences in prognostic factors identified may be because of the
type of patients seen in the palliative setting versus in the
Cancer

phase 1 setting. Patients with dyspnea, or symptomatic
brain metastases, or poor performance status often do not
reach our clinic, because referring physicians are given
general phase 1 trial eligibility criteria by a triaging nurse
that exclude enrolling patients with these problems.
A history of thromboembolism was selected as an independent predictor of decreased survival (hazard ratio
[HR], 2.38; 95% CI, 1.29-4.39; P ¼ .005), a finding that
is supported by the literature. Thrombosis commonly is
associated with cancer. Approximately 15% of patients
who have cancer have thromboembolic complications
during their disease course, and the recurrence rate after
the first episode is significantly higher compared with that
among patients who do not have cancer.7-11 Supportive of
our data, large epidemiologic databases indicate that
patients with cancer who either develop a thromboembolic episode during the natural history of their cancer or
demonstrate thromboembolism when their cancer is diagnosed have decreased survival compared with patients
who do not have a history of thromboembolism.11
We determined that elevated baseline platelets also
significantly predicted decreased survival (HR, 1.72; 95%
CI, 1.12-2.65; P ¼ .014) in our phase 1 patient population. This finding is not surprising considering the observation that platelet counts often become elevated in endstage cancer and have been shown to be predictive of a
poor prognosis for specific malignancies, such as renal and
gastric carcinoma.12-15 It also has been suggested that platelets play a role in the sequestration, adherence, and penetration of tumor cells through the blood vessel
endothelial cell barrier, thus preventing their rapid clearance from the circulation and allowing extravascular formation of nests of cells (metastases).16 In addition,
platelets may play a stimulating role in angiogenesis-dependent tumor growth through their function as transporters of vascular endothelial growth factor.17 The
mechanism of thrombocytosis in cancer probably is humoral, because it has been demonstrated that plasma from
patients with paraneoplastic thrombocytosis contains
thrombopoietins.18
Hepatic metastases was a third independent predictor for decreased survival revealed by our analysis (HR,
1.51; 95% CI, 1.09-2.09; P ¼ .013). Previous studies in
various groups of patients with cancer support this finding.19-22 It is noteworthy that thrombocytosis also has
been correlated with the presence of liver metastases.14
1097

Preliminary results from 2 recently reported studies
indicate that low albumin, elevated LDH, and >2 metastatic sites were predictive of inferior survival.23 The first
of those studies proposed a prognostic score based on
these 3 variables that correlated significantly with patient
survival. The second study demonstrated that a higher
risk score predicted for an increased risk of death within
the first 90 days of a phase 1 study.24
Our study was limited by its retrospective nature,
the relatively small number of patients, and the multiple
parameters analyzed. In addition, caution is needed in
comparing our results with those published previously in
patients who were treated on cytotoxic regimens. Another
weakness of our trial is that our proposed prognostic score
was not derived from a training set and a validation set of
patients to test the model combined with ‘bootstrapping’
methods. In addition, in evaluating the results of the current study, it is important to highlight the finding that
patients are screened before initial consultation in the
Phase 1 Clinic. Because the majority of phase 1 studies
have strict eligibility criteria, including an ECOG performance status of 2, patients are screened carefully, so
that most will meet this criterion. Other factors that may
make the M. D. Anderson population different from that
at other institutions is that we may have a broader range of
tumor types (some rare) and a younger patient population. It is possible that patients who are enrolled on phase
1 studies have a more indolent subtype of disease (because
they have survived beyond standard therapy). Further elucidation of biologic subtypes will help to address this
issue.
In conclusion, the median survival of patients who
were referred to our Phase 1 Clinic was 9 months.
Approximately 25% of these patients remained alive at 18
months (Fig. 1a). Although this prognosis was better than
previously described, it still is quite dismal considering
that our population, with a median age of 58 years, should
have had a life expectancy of an additional 20 years (men)
to 24 years (women).6 Furthermore, we demonstrated 3
baseline clinical factors (thrombocytosis, thromboembolism, and liver metastases) that predicted a worse survival.
It has now been established that phase 1 trials are safe,
with toxic death rates <0.5%.1,2,25 In addition, response
rates are higher than previously assumed: The largest
meta-analysis (11,935 patients) reported overall response
rates (complete and partial) of 11%, and an additional
1098

34% of patients demonstrated less than a partial response
or stable disease.1 Furthermore, some types of phase 1 trials (those that include at least 1 FDA-approved drug) had
response rates of 18%.1 Taken together, these data suggest
that participation in a phase 1 trial is a reasonable option
for patients with advanced, untreatable cancer. In addition, our data allowed the development of a prognostic
score, using either 0 (low), 1 (intermediate), or 2 or (high)
risk factors selected in the multivariate analysis. The median survival was 12.3 months for patients with a low risk,
8 months for patients with an intermediate risk, and 5.2
months for patients with a high risk. The use of such a
prognostic score may assist further in assessing the benefit-to-risk ratio of specific experimental therapies for
patients with advanced cancer.
