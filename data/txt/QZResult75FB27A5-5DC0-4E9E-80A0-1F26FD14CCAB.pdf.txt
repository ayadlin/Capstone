Abstract
The Pim-1 kinase regulates cell survival, proliferation, and
differentiation and is overexpressed frequently in many malignancies, including leukemia and skin cancer. In this study, we
used kinase proﬁling analysis to demonstrate that 20 -hydroxycinnamicaldehyde (20 -HCA), a compound found in cinnamon,
speciﬁcally inhibits Pim-1 activity. Cocrystallography studies
determined the hydrogen bonding pattern between 20 -HCA and
Pim-1. Notably, 20 -HCA binding altered the apo kinase structure
in a manner that shielded the ligand from solvent, thereby acting

as a gatekeeper loop. Biologically, 20 -HCA inhibited the growth of
human erythroleukemia or squamous epidermoid carcinoma
cells by inducing apoptosis. The compound was also effective as
a chemopreventive agent against EGF-mediated neoplastic transformation. Finally, 20 -HCA potently suppressed the growth of
mouse xenografts representing human leukemia or skin cancer.
Overall, our results offered preclinical proof of concept for 20 -HCA
as a potent anticancer principle arising from direct targeting of the
Pim-1 kinase. Cancer Res; 75(13); 2716–28. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

mechanisms of action as well as conﬁrmation of their pharmacodynamic properties (2).
Cinnamon is one of the oldest and most popular spices that has
been used by different cultures around the world and is popular as
a ﬂavoring agent and a preservative for beverages, bakery products, and candies (4). The product is harvested from the dry bark
and twigs of Cinnamomum spp and has been used in traditional
Chinese medicine for treating dyspepsia, gastritis, blood circulation disturbances, inﬂammatory diseases, and cancer in Korea,
China, and India (5). A number of recent studies have shown
several potential health beneﬁts of cinnamon for diabetes, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, and cancer (6). Cinnamon
extracts have been shown to inhibit proliferation of lymphoma,
melanoma, hepatocellular cancer, cervix cancer, and colon cancer
cells in vitro and melanoma in vivo (4, 7–9). These extracts also
reportedly suppress angiogenesis by targeting VEGFR2 (10, 11).
20 -Hydroxycinnamicaldehyde (20 -HCA, Fig. 1Aa) is a major
component of the essential oil of cinnamon and is present at levels
of approximately 0.01 to 0.8 mg/g in commercial cinnamon
powder (4, 12). It is regarded as a major bioactive component
of cinnamon (13) and reportedly inhibits proliferation of several
human cancer cell lines, including breast, colon, leukemia, ovarian, and lung tumor cells (14–18). 20 -HCA also attenuates the in
vivo xenograft growth of colon HCT116 cancer cells and allograft
growth of oral RK3E-ras-Fluc cancer cells (16, 18). However, its
direct molecular targets and mechanisms of action have not been
clearly elucidated.
Proviral insertion in murine lymphomas-1 (Pim-1) is a
proto-oncogene involved in pivotal cellular processes (19).
Pim-1 is overexpressed in various tumors and has been linked
to a poor prognosis (20). Its deregulation also interferes with
apoptosis and cell-cycle–related pathways to promote neoplastic transformation in many forms of malignancy. Overexpression of Pim-1 in mice leads to a greater susceptibility to

Natural compounds found in food and traditional Asian medicines represent a diverse and promising resource for treating
chronic human diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease (1). Although strong clinical
evidence is lacking for many claimed health beneﬁts, a long
history of human consumption lends some credibility to their
efﬁcacy and safety. Research using modern biotechnology methods combining supercomputer technology, protein crystallography, and biologic assays (2) has shown that natural phytochemicals have a number of advantages compared with synthetic
compounds (3). An important foundation for their wider use
involves the elucidation of their direct molecular targets and

spontaneous tumor formation, while increasing susceptibility
to radiation and chemically induced tumorigenesis (21).
Accordingly, interest in developing small-molecule inhibitors
of Pim-1 has been growing (21).
We sought to further investigate the underlying mechanism of
the antitumorigenic effects of 20 -HCA and its relationship with
Pim-1. In this study, we observed that Pim-1 is a direct molecular
target of 20 -HCA and revealed direct molecular binding using Xray cocrystallography. The signiﬁcance of these ﬁndings was
further explored using a number of in vitro and in vivo approaches.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
20 -HCA was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry. Active
Pim-1 and the Pim-1 substrate peptide (KRRRLASLR) were purchased from SignalChem. Antibodies speciﬁc for detecting total
Bad, phosphorylated Bad (Ser112), total ERKs, phosphorylated
ERKs (Thr202/Tyr204), total RSK, phosphorylated RSK (Thr356/
Ser360), PARP, caspase-3, and caspase-9 were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against total Pim-1, PARP,
Bad, p27KIP1, p21CIP1, and b-actin were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology.
Cell culture
All cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection and were cytogenetically tested and authenticated
before being frozen. Each vial of frozen cells was thawed and
maintained in culture for a maximum of 8 weeks. Enough frozen
vials were available for each cell line to ensure that all cell-based
experiments were conducted on cells that had been tested and in
culture for 8 weeks or less. The human erythroleukemia (HEL) cell
line was cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS
(Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc.). HaCaT skin keratinocytes and A431 human
epidermoid carcinoma cells were cultured in DMEM (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1%
antibiotic–antimycotic. JB6 Pþ mouse skin epidermal cells were
cultured in Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 5%
FBS and 1% antibiotic–antimycotic.
Direct and cell-based pull-down assays
An active Pim-1 protein (200 ng) or a HEL cellular supernatant
fraction (500 mg) was incubated with 20 -HCA-Sepharose 4B beads
or Sepharose 4B beads alone as a control (100 mL, 50% slurry) in
reaction buffer [50 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 150
mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.01% Nonidet P40, 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 0.02 mmol/L phenylmethylsufonylﬂuoride (PMSF), and 1 protease inhibitor mixture]. After

incubation with gentle rocking overnight at 4 C, the beads were
washed ﬁve times with reaction buffer (50 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5, 5
mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 0.02 mmol/L PMSF), and proteins bound to the
beads were analyzed by Western blotting.
ATP and 20 -HCA competition assay
Recombinant Pim-1 (0.2 mg) was incubated with 100 mL of 20 HCA-Sepharose 4B beads or 100 mL of Sepharose 4B beads in
reaction buffer (see above) for 12 hours at 4 C. ATP was added at
either 10 or 100 mmol/L to a ﬁnal volume of 500 mL, followed by
incubation for 30 minutes. The samples were washed and proteins
were detected by Western blotting.
In vitro kinase assays
The kinase assays were performed in accordance with instructions provided by EMD Millipore. Brieﬂy, the reaction was carried
out in the presence of 10 mCi of [g-32P] ATP with each compound
in 40 mL of reaction buffer containing 20 mmol/L N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-2-ethanesulfonic acid (pH 7.4), 10 mmol/L
MgCl2, 10 mmol/L MnCl2 and 1 mmol/L DTT. Diluted [g-32P]
ATP solution (10 mL) was incubated at 30 C for 10 minutes in
assay buffer (described above) and substrate peptide and then 15
mL aliquots were transferred onto p81 paper and washed three
minutes with 0.75% phosphoric acid (5 minutes per wash) and
once with acetone (5 minutes). The incorporation of radioactivity
was determined using a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter)
Crystallization and data collection
Cocrystallography of Pim-1 and 20 -HCA was performed at
SARomics Biostructures AB (Lund, Sweden). Diffraction quality
crystals were grown in MRC Maxi plates (Molecular Dimensions)
containing 150 nL Pim-1 at 10 mg/mL in 25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
7.5), 250 mmol/L NaCl, and 5 mmol/L DTT mixed with a 50 nL
reservoir consisting of 0.1 mol/L imidazole (pH 6.3), and 1.2 to
1.4 mol/L sodium acetate. Crystals grew to their full size of about
0.05  0.05  0.4 mm over the course of 1 week at 4 C. A stock
solution of 150 mmol/L 20 -HCA in 50% DMSO was prepared.
Suitable crystals were transferred from the crystallization drops
into a 3 mL drop of soaking solution consisting of 0.1 mol/L
imidazole pH 6.3, 1.4 mol/L sodium acetate, 10 mmol/L 20 -HCA
and 3.3% DMSO. The drop was sealed over reservoir solution and
incubated for 48 hours. A soaked crystal measuring 0.04  0.04 
0.2 mm was ﬂash-frozen in cryo solution (0.1 mol/L imidazole
pH 6.3, 1.4 mol/L sodium acetate, 10 mmol/L 20 -HCA, 3.3%
DMSO, 20% glycerol) and data were collected at 100 K. The data
were collected to 2.5 Å at beamline I911-3 of the MAX-II synchrotron in Lund, Sweden using a 165 mm CCD detector from
MarResearch. These data were processed with XDS, scaled in

XSCALE and converted to the MTZ format with XDSCONV (see
Supplementary Table S1 for details; ref. 22).
Structure determination and reﬁnement
The structure of Pim-1 in complex with benzofuran-2-carboxylic acid (PDB code 3R04) with the ligand removed was used as a
search model for molecular replacement using the Phaser program in the CCP4 program suite (23, 24). Five percent of the
reﬂections were used for calculation of the free R-value (see values
in parentheses in Supplementary Table S1). Iterative rebuilding of
the model and addition of solvent molecules was conducted using
Coot (24). The model was ﬁnally improved by restrained reﬁnement using REFMAC5 (25). The density for the 20 -HCA ligand was
not completely visible at a contour level of 1.0 s, so the ligand
placement was aided by the hydrogen-bonding pattern between
the ligand and the neighboring water molecules and side chains.
The reﬁnement statistics have been summarized in Supplementary Table S1.
Lentiviral infection
The lentiviral expression vectors, including Gipz-shPim-1
(TATACACAGTCAGCAATGC, RNAi core, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN), and packaging vectors, including
pMD2.0G and psPAX, were purchased from Addgene, Inc.. To
prepare shPim-1 viral particles, each viral vector and the packaging vectors (pMD2.0G and psPAX) were transfected using jetPEI
into HEK293T cells following the manufacturer's instructions.
The transfection medium was changed at 4 hours after transfection and the cells were then cultured for 36 hours. The viral
particles were harvested by ﬁltration using a 0.45 mm syringe
ﬁlter, then combined with 8 mg/mL polybrene (EMD Millipore)
and infected into 60% conﬂuent HEL, A431 or HaCaT cells
overnight. The cell culture medium was replaced with fresh
complete growth medium for 24 hours before the cells were
selected using puromycin (2 mg/mL; Sigma) over 36 hours. The
selected cells were then used for further experiments.
Immunoblot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared with radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mmol/L Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 1% NP-40,
0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 150
mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and
1 protease inhibitor tablet). Equal loading of protein was
conﬁrmed using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Proteins
were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (EMD Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5%
non-fat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies overnight at

4 C. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the
membrane was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:5000 dilution and the signal
was detected with a chemiluminescence reagent (GE
Healthcare).
Cell proliferation assays
Cells were seeded (1  103 cells per well) in 96-well plates and
incubated for 24 hours, before treatment with the indicated doses
of each compound. After incubation for 1, 2, or 3 days, 20 mL of
CellTiter96 AQueous One Solution (Promega) were added and
the cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37 C in a 5% CO2 incubator.
Absorbance was measured at 492 nm.
Anchorage-independent cell growth
Cells (8  103 per well) suspended in Basal Medium Eagle
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics were added to
0.3% agar with varying doses of each compound in the top layer
over a base layer of 0.6% agar. The cultures were maintained at
37 C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 3 weeks before colonies were
counted under a microscope using the Image-Pro Plus Software
(vs.4) program (Media Cybernetics).
Annexin V staining
Apoptosis was assessed using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis
Detection Kit (MBL International Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated and then harvested
and washed with PBS and incubated for 5 minutes at room
temperature with Annexin V-FITC plus propidium iodide (PI).
Cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).
Xenograft mouse model
The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care
and Use Committee of Seoul National University (SNU-1309041). Male or female mice (6-week-old, BALB/c-nu) implanted with
HEL or A431 cells, respectively, were used for the xenograft assay.
A431 (1  106) or HEL (2  107) cells, suspended in 100 mL of
serum-free media containing 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences),
were implanted subcutaneously in both dorsal ﬂanks of mice.
Cells were allowed to form tumors, and once the tumors reached a
size of 50 mm3, the mice were randomly assigned into groups (8
mice/group). In previous studies by others, mice were treated with
20 -HCA with doses ranging from 10 to 50 mg/kg/day by intraperitoneal injection. On the basis of this information, we performed a pilot study to determine the optimal dosage of 20 -HCA
treatment, and chose to treat with 20 -HCA at 5 and 20 mg/kg as
optimal dosages to show a dose dependency of its tumor

the experiment and tumor tissues were preserved for further
analysis. Note that no study speciﬁc study has focused on the
pharmacokinetics of 20 -HCA. But one study (26) used cinnamaldehyde and observed blood levels of over 1 mmol/L in the blood.

Cinnamon Inhibits Pim-1 in Leukemia and Skin Cancer

Thus, the concentrations used in this study seem reasonable based
on the literature.
Immunostaining analysis
The immunostaining assay was conducted on tumor samples
that were frozen using tissue-freezing medium immediately after
dissection and stored at 70 C. Cryostat sections were cut into
fragments of 10 mm thickness and ﬁxed with cold acetone for 10
minutes at room temperature and left to dry. Specimens were
incubated in 5% goat serum in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100
(PBS-T) for 1 hour at room temperature to permeabilize them and
block any nonspeciﬁc antibody binding. Primary antibodies were
incubated at 4 C overnight, and secondary antibodies for 2 hours
at room temperature. Fluorescent images were obtained by confocal microscopy and signal-positive area densities were measured by analysis of pixel-based ﬂuorescence intensities using the
ImageJ software program (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Statistical analysis
All quantitative results are expressed as mean values  SD or SE.
Statistically signiﬁcant differences were determined using the
Student t test or by one-way ANOVA. Values of P < 0.05 were
considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.

Pim-1 is a direct molecular target of 2 -HCA
To elucidate the molecular target of 20 -HCA, we screened 77
cancer-related kinases using KinaseProﬁler provided by EMD
Millipore. Results of the screening with 20 mmol/L 20 -HCA indicated that only the activity of Pim-1 was decreased by more than
80% (Supplementary Table S2). The activity was reduced in a
concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of approximately
3 mmol/L (Fig. 1A, b). To identify the mechanism by which 20 HCA modulates Pim-1 activity, we determined whether 20 -HCA
could bind directly to Pim-1. Pull-down assay results revealed that
20 -HCA physically binds to the active Pim-1 protein (Fig. 1B, a,
lane 3), but not to unconjugated Sepharose 4B beads (Fig. 1Ba,
lane 2). The input lane (Fig. 1B, a, lane 1) showing the loading of
20 ng of the active Pim-1 protein as a marker, veriﬁed that the
detected band represents the Pim-1 protein. We also observed
binding of 20 -HCA to Pim-1 in HEL cells (Fig. 1B, b). Next, to
examine the mode of 20 -HCA binding to Pim-1, we performed
ATP competitive-binding assays. ATP was found to compete with
20 -HCA for Pim-1 binding (Fig. 1B, c), suggesting that 20 -HCA
binds to the Pim-1 ATP-binding pocket.
Crystal structure of Pim-1 in complex with 20 -HCA
We determined the crystal structure of Pim-1 in complex with
20 -HCA to a resolution of 2.5 Å. The structure includes amino
acids 33 to 305, the 20 -HCA ligand, an imidazole molecule and 52
water molecules. The ﬁnal R-factor for the model was 0.175 (Rfree
¼ 0.219). The overall structure is very similar to the apo structure

except for some loop regions that are shifted by a few Å (Fig. 1C).
The most signiﬁcant difference is the relocation of the glycine-rich
loop (Leu44–Val51) to block the entrance to the binding site.
Analysis of the glycine-rich loop showed that the Phe49 residue
extends into the active site to interact with 20 -HCA while the same
loop in the structure of Pim-1 in complex with benzofuran-2carboxylic acid was also shown to adopt the same conformation
as in the apo structure (Fig. 1D, E, F).
20 -HCA inhibits anchorage-dependent and -independent cell
growth of HEL and A431 cells
To identify an accurate cell model to determine the anticancer
effects of 20 -HCA, we ﬁrst used the Human Protein Atlas database
to search for cell lines expressing the highest Pim-1 levels (27). A
human erythroleukemia cell line, HEL, was identiﬁed in the
database as having the highest Pim-1 expression. A431 cells
overexpressing EGFR have been shown to grow in athymic
nude mice, which represent an excellent model for studying
EGF-mediated skin cancers. We therefore measured anchorageindependent and -dependent cell growth of HEL and A431 cells
by soft agar and MTS assays, respectively. 20 -HCA treatment (2.5–
10 mmol/L) was found to suppress both anchorage-independent
(Fig. 2A) and -dependent (Fig. 2B) growth of HEL (Fig. 2A, a–d
and B, a) and A431 cells (Fig. 2A, e–h and B, b).
20 -HCA induces apoptosis and inhibits Bad phosphorylation
Pim-1 plays a pivotal role in resistance to apoptosis and cellcycle progression, as well as hypoxic responses (28). Pim-1
inactivates the proapoptotic Bad protein by phosphorylating its
Ser112 residue (29). HEL and A431 cells were treated with 20 -HCA
(2.5–10 mmol/L) for various time periods and apoptosis was
assessed by Annexin V staining and ﬂow cytometry. 20 -HCA
treatment induced substantial apoptosis in both HEL and A431
cell lines (Fig. 2C). We also observed that 20 -HCA (2.5–10 mmol/
L) inhibits phosphorylation of Bad at Ser112, which is a direct
phosphorylation target of Pim-1 (Fig. 2D). Analysis of apoptosisrelated proteins revealed that PARP, caspase-9, and caspase-3 were
activated by 20 -HCA, in association with increased expression of
p27KIP and p21CIP (Fig. 2E, a and b). Previous studies have shown
that Pim-1 regulates the MAPK and AKT pathways (30–33). We
observed that 20 -HCA (2.5–10 mmol/L) inhibits the phosphorylation of ERKs, p38, and AKT in HEL (Fig. 2Fa) and A431 cells
(Fig. 2Fb).
20 -HCA inhibits EGF-induced transformation of HaCaT and JB6
cells
The EGF-induced cell transformation models with JB6 Pþ or
HaCaT cells are some of the best models for studying cancer
prevention. JB6 Pþ and HaCaT cells are normal skin cell lines
and treatment of these cells with EGF can transform them to
cancerous cells in soft agar. Anchorage-independent cell
growth in soft agar is a well-accepted marker for transformation. Thus, we used these neoplastic cell transformation

models to measure the chemopreventive effects of 20 -HCA in
JB6 Pþ and HaCaT cells. Quantiﬁcation of cell colonies
revealed that EGF-induced neoplastic transformation was
markedly inhibited in HaCaT (Fig. 3A, a–f) and JB6 Pþ (Fig.
3B, a–f) cells treated with 5 mmol/L 20 -HCA. Similar to HEL
and A431 cells, 20 -HCA inhibited EGF-induced signaling in
HaCaT (Fig. 3C, a–c) and JB6 Pþ (Fig. 3D, a–c) cells. NF-kB
and AP-1 are well-known transcription factors activated by
EGF and play pivotal roles in neoplastic transformation (34).
A luciferase reporter gene assay with stable NF-kB and AP-1
luciferase-transfected HaCaT or JB6 Pþ cells showed that 20 HCA treatment (2.5–10 mmol/L) inhibited both NF-kB
(Fig. 3E) and AP-1 (Fig. 3F) transactivation.
Knockdown of Pim-1 mimics the inhibitory effects of 20 -HCA
treatment
We next investigated the effects of knocking down Pim-1
expression on anchorage-dependent and -independent growth
of HEL and A431 cells, and on EGF-induced cell transformation of
the human HaCaT cells. Anchorage-independent cell growth of
HEL and A431 cells silenced with shPim-1 was slower than that of
mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4A, a and b). EGF-induced transformation in HaCaT cells was also decreased by knockdown of Pim-1
(Fig. 4Ac). Treatment with 20 -HCA also decreased anchoragedependent growth of HEL (Fig. 4Ba) and A431 (Fig. 4Bb) cells.
Notably, compared with HEL and A431 cells expressing GFP–
shRNA (shMock), HEL, and A431 cells expressing shPim-1 exhibited a substantially reduced abundance of endogenous Pim-1
(Fig. 4C). Knockdown of Pim-1 inhibited phosphorylation of
ERKs, p38, and AKT (Fig. 4C, a and b), as well as EGF-induced
ERKs, p38, and AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 4Cc).
Pim-1 knockdown elicits resistance to 20 -HCA
To conﬁrm the speciﬁcity of 20 -HCA, we compared its
effects on mock- and shPim-1–transfected cells. Because
growth rates are altered by knockdown of Pim-1, we designated the proliferation rate of 20 -HCA untreated cells as 100%
to compare the mock and shPim-1 HEL and A431 groups. For
HaCaT cells, the EGF-only group was set as the 100% comparator. The results indicated that cells expressing shPim-1
were resistant to the inhibitory effects of 20 -HCA against
anchorage-independent cell growth in HEL (Fig. 5Aa), A431
(Fig. 5Ab) cells, and EGF-induced transformation of HaCaT
cells (Fig. 5Ac), compared with cells expressing shMock (Fig.
5A). We also examined the effect of 20 -HCA on anchoragedependent cell growth between mock and shPim-1 HEL and
A431 cells. The results showed that the inhibitory effect of 20 HCA (5–10 mmol/L) on shPim-1 cells was much less than its
effect on shMock-transfected HEL (Fig. 5Ba) or A431 cells
(Fig. 5Bb). In addition, 20 -HCA (5–10 mmol/L) induced apoptosis to a greater extent in shMock cells compared with
shPim-1 cells (Fig. 5C, a and b). These ﬁndings suggest that
the anticancer effects of 20 -HCA are at least partially dependent on Pim-1 protein expression.
20 -HCA inhibits leukemia and skin cancer tumor growth in a
xenograft mouse model
To investigate the anticancer effects of 20 -HCA in vivo, HEL or
A431 cells were subcutaneously transplanted into nude mice,
followed by treatment with 20 -HCA (5 or 20 mg/kg). Mice
treated with 20 -HCA exhibited signiﬁcantly suppressed HEL and

A431-derived tumor growth (Fig. 6A and B) that occurred in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C and D). Immunostaining data
demonstrated that the levels of PCNA, a cell proliferation
marker, were lower in the 20 -HCA–treated HEL and A431 tumor
groups compared with the vehicle-treated groups (Fig. 6E and
F). In addition, the levels of cleaved caspase-3, a cellular marker
of apoptosis, were higher in the 20 -HCA–treated tumors compared with the vehicle-treated group (Fig. 6E and F). Immunoblot data showed that both the HEL (Fig. 6G) and A431 (Fig.
6H) groups treated with 20 -HCA had tumors exhibiting lower
phosphorylation levels of Bad, which is a direct downstream
substrate of Pim-1. No signiﬁcant body weight loss or conspicuous physical changes were observed in mice treated with 20 HCA, suggesting that the compound was not overtly toxic to the
animals (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1C).

Discussion
The traditional approach to elucidating the beneﬁcial effects of
phytochemicals begins with the screening of their effects, followed by the identiﬁcation of the molecular targets and the overall
mechanism of action. Many potential obstacles can arise at each
step, which causes signiﬁcant hurdles for researchers. In this study,
we took an opposite approach and ﬁrst identiﬁed the molecular
target of a natural compound found in cinnamon. At this time, no
one else has studied or identiﬁed a direct target for this cinnamon
compound. By screening a library of protein kinases, we discovered that Pim-1 is a target of 20 -HCA. Using structural biology
methods, we then demonstrated the physical binding mode
between Pim-1 and 20 -HCA. We further identiﬁed the speciﬁc
disease subtypes relevant for the effects of 20 -HCA on Pim-1. Pim1 is highly expressed in leukemia cells and 20 -HCA exhibits
inhibitory effects on these cells in vitro and in vivo. On the basis
of the xenograft tumor volume and mass data of both HEL and
A431 tumors, treatment with 20 -HCA resulted in dose-dependent
tumor growth-inhibitory effects. In HEL tumor data, 20 -HCA
treatment signiﬁcantly decreased tumor volume and mass in a
dose-dependent manner with the higher dose seeming more
effective. Moreover, in the A431 tumor data, only the tumors in
the 20 mg/kg treated group were signiﬁcantly decreased. These
results demonstrated that 20 -HCA treatment inhibited tumor
growth in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, 20 -HCA was
also found to have chemopreventive effects in both leukemia and
skin cancer cell lines, stemming from Pim-1 inhibition.
Pim-1 is a kinase that is primarily involved in transcriptional
activation and cellular signal transduction pathways related to cellcycle progression and apoptosis (28). Pim-1 overexpression has
been observed in many types of cancer, including leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, gastric carcinoma, and bladder cancer (35), and it phosphorylates the antiapoptosis protein,
Bad, to inhibit apoptosis (29). We also measured the phosphorylation levels of Bad, which is representative of Pim1 activity and 20 HCA treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of Bad in a dosedependent manner in both HEL and A431 tumors. Myc, p21cip, and
p27kip are also substrates of Pim-1 (33, 36, 37). Many studies have
shown that the inhibition of Pim-1 using pharmacologic inhibitors, shRNA and Pim-1–speciﬁc antibodies regulates signal transduction through the MAPK and AKT pathways, inducing apoptosis
(30, 31, 38). Because of its importance in leukemia, drugs targeting
the Pim-1 kinase, such as AZD1208, are being tested in phase I
clinical trials. In this study, using three types of experimental

Cinnamon Inhibits Pim-1 in Leukemia and Skin Cancer

models, we demonstrated that inhibition of Pim-1 by 20 -HCA
creates a similar pattern to that for inhibition of Pim-1 by shRNA.
Anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth were suppressed in the presence of either 20 -HCA and shPim-1.
The speciﬁcity of small molecules for their designated cellular
targets is a major point of concern in drug development. In this
study, we screened 77 protein kinases, and found that 20 -HCA
inhibited Pim-1 by at least 80%, an effect that was not observed
for any other kinase. 20 -HCA treatment or expression of shPim-1
resulted in similar effects on signal transduction. In addition, we
showed that 20 -HCA resistance arises in Pim-1 knockdown cells.
These data support the notion that 20 -HCA is a speciﬁc inhibitor of
Pim-1. To determine how 20 -HCA speciﬁcally targets Pim-1, we
used structural biology approaches. Pim-1 is functionally and
structurally different from other classes of kinases (39), and has a
unique hinge region sequence as well as novel hinge architecture
(40). Our cocrystallography data revealed that 20 -HCA binds at
the unique hinge region of Pim-1. This underscores the possibility
of developing an effective therapeutic agent with high speciﬁcity
for Pim-1 (39).
In the crystallography results, the density for the 20 -HCA ligand
was not completely visible at a contour level of 1.0 s, so the ligand
placement was aided by the hydrogen-bonding pattern between
the ligand and the neighboring water molecules and side chains.
The observation that a ligand this small is not completely visible
in an active site that was meant for a much larger ligand is not
surprising. The molecule appears to be a relatively weak binder,
without many steric constraints to exclude alternative orientations. However, 20 -HCA overlaps with and is coplanar with the
aromatic ring system of benzofuran-2-carboxylic acid in PDB
entry 3R04 (Fig. 1E). The 2-hydroxy group also makes hydrogen
bond contacts with Lys67 and the backbone amino group of
Asp168. The interactions at the innermost part of the binding
pocket are conserved. An interesting feature of the interaction of
20 -HCA is the recruitment of Phe49 that moves 6.3 Å away from its
position in the apo structure to shield the ligand from the exterior
solvent. This movement completely remodels the glycine-rich
loop such that it blocks the entrance to the binding pocket acting
as a gatekeeper loop.

Elucidation of the direct molecular targets of new potential
medicines is the ﬁrst step towards personalized therapeutic
approaches (41). Our study has highlighted the feasibility of
such approaches, with the possibility of 20 -HCA–derived therapies having potential application for the treatment of patients
with high Pim-1 activity. The further elucidation of targeted
agents like 20 -HCA combined with genetic analysis of each
patient will help usher in an accelerated era of personalized
medicine.
