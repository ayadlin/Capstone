Abstract
Bioluminescence imaging is widely used to evaluate tumor
growth and response to therapy in living animals. In cells
expressing luciferase under the control of a constitutive
promoter, light output in part depends on viable cell number,
so that changes in bioluminescence intensity may be correlated with changes in viable tumor mass over time. We have
found that treatment of cancer cell lines expressing luciferase
under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter with
staurosporine, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel results in a
transient increase in bioluminescence, which is positively
correlated with apoptosis and inversely correlated with cell
viability. In contrast, similar treatment of cell lines expressing
luciferase under control of the SV40 promoter did not exhibit
this result. We found that low doses of staurosporine induced
bioluminescence in CMV- but not SV40-driven luciferase cell
lines, whereas high doses elicited induction in both, indicating
promoter-dependent and promoter-independent mechanisms
of bioluminescence induction. The promoter-dependent increase in bioluminescence intensity from CMV-driven luciferase is a result of induction of luciferase mRNA and protein
expression. We extended these findings in vivo; doxorubicin
treatment resulted in a transient induction in bioluminescence when normalized to tumor volume in CMV- but not
SV40-driven luciferase-expressing xenografts. We found that
inhibition of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathway blocked bioluminescence induction by doxorubicin,
paclitaxel, and staurosporine in CMV-driven luciferaseexpressing cells. These findings have important implications
when using bioluminescence to monitor the efficacy of
anticancer therapy and underscore the complex regulation
of the CMV promoter, which is widely used for high-level
protein expression in mammalian cells. [Cancer Res 2007;

Introduction
The development of small animal imaging techniques, including
bioluminescence imaging (BLI), has greatly impacted our ability to
study the biology of cancer as well as to evaluate tumor response to

therapy (1). BLI is based on the detection of photons generated
from cells expressing a luciferase enzyme (2). The light-generating
reaction also requires a substrate molecule (e.g., luciferin) as well as
ATP, oxygen, and Mg2+, so that signal can only be generated in
viable cells. Expression of luciferase may be accomplished through
stable expression in cancer cell lines used for transplantable tumor
models or by transgenic expression of luciferase in genetically
modified cancer-prone mice (3, 4).
One application of this approach has been to use BLI to monitor
response to therapy (5, 6). Although constitutive expression of
luciferase can report on cytotoxic effects of therapy, expression of
luciferase in various reporter strategies can show that particular
biological mechanisms are engaged by drug treatment (see, for
examples, refs. 7–9). Implementation of these approaches requires
that the light signal is correlated with parameters, such as cell
viability, pathway activation/inhibition, etc., for which photon
emission is a surrogate measurement. This has been well
documented in the previously cited studies. However, because this
technology has emerged, there have been questions about how
certain features of the tumor microenvironment may influence
bioluminescence signal generation, such as hypoxia, cellular
metabolism, and distribution of substrate (10–12). It is thus
important to remain aware of these and other possibilities as the
use of BLI in cancer models is further developed and implemented.
In xenograft and syngeneic transplant models, expression of
luciferase is achieved through stable transfection or transduction of
a vector for luciferase expression. Generally, strong promoters in
mammalian cells such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), SV40, and others
have been used for constitutive expression of luciferase (6, 13, 14).
Higher luciferase expression may generate more signal, allowing
for more sensitive detection of cells in vivo. However, it is important to remember that these promoters, while expressed well in
many cell types, may nonetheless be regulated by various biological
influences. In cells engineered to express CMV-driven luciferase, we
show that treatment with chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin
and paclitaxel results in a transient increase in bioluminescence,
although the cells are undergoing apoptosis and are less viable than
control cells. We find that this is a result of increased steady-state
luciferase mRNA and protein. Up-regulation of luciferase is
dependent on the activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway, which is known to regulate several
transcription factors capable of influencing the CMV promoter.
Additionally, we find that low doses of staurosporine are capable of
inducing bioluminescence through the same mechanism in cells
expressing CMV luciferase; however, at high doses, induction
occurs in both CMV- and SV40-luciferase cell lines through a
mechanism that does not require protein synthesis. We are able to
recapitulate our in vitro results in vivo using a mouse xenograft

model. The data presented here have important implications when
using BLI to monitor the response of tumor cells to cancer therapy
both in cell culture and in animal hosts.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and generation of luciferase-expressing cell lines. All cell
lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. 22RV1,
LNCaP, and 4T1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, and PC3, NIH/3T3, and
MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in DMEM. All cell culture media was
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 1% nonessential
amino acids; media for luciferase-expressing cell lines was also supplemented with 400 Ag/mL Geneticin (G418). All cells were cultured at 37jC in
an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Generation of the CMV luciferaseexpressing 22Rv1-CMVluc (22Rv1.Luc.PN2) cells was previously described
(15). PC3-CMVluc, MDA.MB.231-CMVluc, 4T1-CMVluc, and NIH3T3CMVluc cells were generated using the same method. Generation of SV40
luciferase-expressing 22Rv1-SV40luc (22Rv1.Luc.1.17) cells was previously
described (16). Generation of CMV androgen receptor (AR)–overexpressing
PC3 cells and spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV)–driven LNCaP cells were
previously described (17). For transient transfection experiments,
MDA.MB.231 cells were transfected with either pCDNA3.1-luc [CMV-Luc:
pGEM luciferase (Promega) subcloned into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen)] or pGL3
(SV40 Luc-Promega) plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Drug treatments. For doxorubicin and paclitaxel treatment, cells were
seeded at 2  105 per well in 24-well plates for caspase-3 assays or 1  105
per well in 48-well plates for bioluminescence and 4-[3-(4-indophenyl)-2(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate (WST) assays.
Twenty-four hours later, media was removed and replaced with fresh
media (500 AL for 24-well plates and 250 AL for 48-well plates) for nontreated
controls or media containing a dose range of doxorubicin (100, 400, 750, and
1,000 nmol/L; Sigma) or paclitaxel (30, 90, 300, and 900 nmol/L; Sigma). For
MDA.MB.231 cells transiently expressing luciferase, paclitaxel was added
48 h after transfection. For staurosporine treatment, cells were seeded in
48-well plates at 1.5  105 per well. The next day, cells were incubated for
30 min in 250 AL fresh media containing 150 Ag/mL D-luciferin. About
100 AL of the appropriate dilution of STS was then added directly to cells
to final concentrations of 4 Amol/L, 250 nmol/L, or 60 nmol/L, and control
cells received 100 AL of 0.4% DMSO to make a total volume of 350 AL per
well. For cycloheximide treatment, 22Rv1-CMVluc cells were seeded at
1  105 per well in a 48-well plate. The next day, cells were pretreated
with 10 Ag/mL cycloheximide (Sigma) or vehicle control (H2O) for 2 h.
D-Luciferin was then added to cells at a final concentration of 150 Ag/mL
for 20 min. Cells were then treated with 4 Amol/L or 60 nmol/L staurosporine or 0.4% DMSO in a total volume of 350 AL per well. For p38 MAPK
inhibition, cells were treated with a dose range of SB203580 (3, 10, or
30 Amol/L; Sigma) either alone or in combination with 400 nmol/L
doxorubicin (22Rv1-CMVluc) or 90 nmol/L paclitaxel (PC3-CMVluc) for a
period of 48 h. About 0.1% DMSO was used as a vehicle control. Treated
cells were analyzed (see below) at various time points for bioluminescence,
cell viability (WST assay), and caspase-3 activity. Media was not changed
throughout any of the treatment periods. For the experiments shown
in Supplementary Fig. S2, cells were either treated with 100 ng/mL
Trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma) or with media for 24 h before Western blots
were done as previously described (18).
Bioluminescence imaging. All BLI was done using an IVIS 100 imaging
system (Caliper Life Sciences). BLI of cells was done by the addition of
D-luciferin (Caliper Life Sciences) to the cell culture medium at a final
concentration of 150 Ag/mL. Samples were then imaged using a 15-cm field
of view with exposure times varying from 1 to 15 s. Photon flux was
calculated using Living Image software (version 2.5) and represented as
photons/s/cm2/sr. Bioluminescence values were then represented as
percent photon flux of untreated or vehicle control values.
Caspase-3 assay and cell viability assays. Assays for caspase-3 activity
were done using a commercially available colorimetric caspase-3 assay kit
(Sigma CASP-3-C). Cells were seeded at 2  105 per well in 24-well plates for

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

24 h at 37jC and then exposed to either apoptotic stimuli, vehicle control,
or left untreated. At each time point, caspase-3 activity was measured
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Treated cells were compared with
nontreated or vehicle control cells, and values were represented as mean F
SE percent of control value.
Cell viability was determined using a cell proliferation reagent WST-1
(Roche) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Values from treated cells
were divided by those from nontreated control values and represented as
percent of control value. Each data point represents the mean F SE.
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR of luciferase mRNA. Primers
are as follows: pGEM Luciferase forward primer: 5¶-CCGCGTACGTGATGTTCACC-3¶; pGEM Luciferase reverse primer: 5¶-GAGGATGGAACCGCTGGAGA-3¶. pGL3 Luciferase forward primer: 5¶-CGCGGTCGGTAAAGTTGTTC3¶; pGL3 Luciferase reverse primer: 5¶-CCCGGTATCCAGATCCACAA-3¶.
Human GAPDH forward primer: 5¶-CCATGTTCGTCATGGGTGTG-3¶; Human GAPDH reverse primer: 5¶CAGGGGTGCTAAGCAGTTGG-3¶.
Total RNA isolation was done using RNEasy tissue kit (Qiagen), and
reverse transcription was carried out using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad). The resulting cDNAs were used as PCR template using CYBR Green I
(Invitrogen), and data were collected on iCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad).
Experimental values were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) values. Relative expression values were calculated
using a comparative Ct method (19).
Luciferase activity assay. Lysates of staurosporine-treated, doxorubicintreated, or untreated cells were prepared by adding 500 AL of lysate buffer
[250 mmol/L sucrose, 25 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH, 7.2)] to
monolayers growing in six-well plates and homogenizing by pipetting.
Protein concentrations were calculated using a Bio-Rad Dc Protein Assay.
Equal amounts of protein (averaging 37 Ag per well per assay) were added
at a volume of 50 AL to 96 well plates, mixed with 100 AL assay buffer
[15 mmol/L MgCl2, 150 Ag/mL D-luciferin, 1 Ag/mL ATP, 1 mol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4)] and imaged in an IVIS 100.
Subcutaneous tumor model. All animal procedures were done with
approval from the University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee. A
total of 24 male athymic nu/nu mice (National Cancer Institute) were
injected into the periscapular subcutis with either 2  106 22Rv1-CMVluc
cells (12 mice) or 2  106 22Rv1-SV40luc cells (12 mice) while being
maintained on 3% isoflurane. Mice were returned to their housing and
closely monitored for body weight and general health status. After 13 days
of tumor development, mice were imaged using the IVIS 100, and tumor
volumes were measured using calipers and calculated using the equation
(1/2)(L  W 2). For each cell line, mice were randomly divided into two
groups (n = 6; designated PBS and doxorubicin), each group having similar
average bioluminescence intensities as determined by t test. Mice in the
PBS group then received 200 AL of PBS, and mice in the doxorubicin group
received 200 AL of 8 mg/kg doxorubicin (200 AL at 1 mg/mL) via i.v. tail vein
injection. Mice were imaged, and tumor volumes were recorded at 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 10, and 23 days posttreatment. Body weight was measured at the same
time intervals. For BLI of mice, mice were first anesthetized in a chamber
with 3% isoflurane. D-Luciferin was then given to each mouse via i.p.
injection at a dose of 150 mg/kg and left to incubate for 8 min while being
maintained on 3% isoflurane. Mice were then imaged using a 20-cm field of
view and an exposure time of 1 s. Bioluminescence values were calculated
by measuring photons/s/cm2/sr in the region of interest surrounding the
bioluminescence signal from the tumor, with the lower signal threshold set
to 5% of the maximum signal value.
p38 MAPK Western blot. Lysates were prepared from cells treated with or
without lipopolysaccharide or 400 nmol/L doxorubicin for a period of 5 min.
Protein concentrations were calculated using a Bio-Rad Dc Protein Assay.
Equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed in a 12% SDS poly acrylamide
gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes
were blotted with phospho-p38 MAPK antibody (Biosource 44-684G) or
h-actin antibody (Sigma A1978) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (The Jackson Laboratory;
111-035-003), and signal was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence.
Statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were done using ANOVA
with Bonferroni post-tests.

Chemotherapeutic Effects on Bioluminescence Imaging

Results
Treatment of luciferase-expressing prostate cancer cells
with apoptosis-inducing agents results in a transient increase
in bioluminescence. We examined the effects of chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin, a DNA-damaging agent; paclitaxel, a
microtubule-stabilizing agent; and staurosporine, a potent protein
kinase inhibitor, on luciferase-expressing human prostate cancer
cell lines (Figs. 1 and 2, Table 1, and Supplementary Fig. S1). These
cell lines have been engineered to stably express luciferase either
via retroviral transduction with CMV-driven luciferase (CMVluc) or
stable transfection with SV40-driven luciferase (SV40luc) and are
designated as 22Rv1-CMVluc, PC3-CMVluc, and 22Rv1-SV40luc. As
expected, in all three cell lines, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and
staurosporine elicited apoptotic cell death and a consequent loss
of cell viability as measured by caspase-3 activity and WST viability
assay, respectively (Figs. 1C and 2B and Supplementary Fig. S1).
High-dose staurosporine (4 Amol/L) rapidly caused significant
induction of apoptosis by 2 h (Fig. 1C) and a significant loss of
cell viability 6 to 8 h posttreatment (data not shown). Lower doses
of staurosporine (60 and 250 nmol/L) induced a slight but
significant induction of caspase-3 and reduction of cell viability
by 24 h (Fig. 1D). Similarly, doxorubicin and paclitaxel treatment
resulted in peak caspase-3 activity between 24 and 48 h, and cell
viability significantly decreased 48 h after treatment (Fig. 2B and
Supplementary Fig. S1B, C, E, F, H, and I).

We also measured bioluminescence from these cell lines, and
surprisingly, we found increased signal upon staurosporine
treatment of all three cell lines and upon doxorubicin and paclitaxel
treatment of 22Rv1-CMVluc and PC3-CMVluc cells (Figs. 1A–D and
2A and B, Supplementary Fig. S1, and Table 1). The increase in
bioluminescence signal in response to doxorubicin and paclitaxel
occurred even as these cells were undergoing apoptotic cell death
and a loss in cell viability (Fig. 2B, Table 1, and Supplementary
Fig. S1B, C, and E). In contrast, we only observed an increase
in bioluminescence in 22Rv1-SV40luc cells treated with a high
4-Amol/L dose of staurosporine (Fig. 1A), whereas we observed
increases with 4 Amol/L and lower doses of 60 and 250 nmol/L
in both 22Rv1-CMVluc and PC3-CMVluc cells (Fig. 1A–D ).
Bioluminescence induction in response to 4 Amol/L staurosporine
was characteristically rapid, peaking within 1 h of treatment
(Fig. 1C) and preceding peak induction of apoptosis, whereas the
increase in bioluminescence signal from the 60-nmol/L staurosporine-treated CMVluc cell lines became maximal only after 24 h,
similar to the time course for the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 1D).
In 22Rv1-CMVluc cells, all three agents induced an increase in
bioluminescence to levels significantly higher than control values,
ranging from 150% to 250%. With the exception of doxorubicin
treatment, we saw similar effects in PC3-CMVluc cells (Figs. 1A
and B, and 2A). At later time points (f120 h with doxorubicin
and paclitaxel), cells treated with any of the three agents exhibited

which these agents induce apoptosis and a loss in cell viability.
We also noticed similar effects when cells were treated with the
histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA. TSA was able to induce
bioluminescence in both 22Rv1-CMVluc and PC3-CMVluc cell lines

decreases in bioluminescence to levels below that of untreated
control values (Fig. 2B, Table 1, and Supplementary Fig. S1B, C, E, F,

bioluminescence, and in some cases, this occurs during a period in

Chemotherapeutic Effects on Bioluminescence Imaging

(Supplementary Fig. S2A). This effect was also not limited to the
expression of luciferase as TSA treatment induced AR expression in
PC3 cells engineered to express AR from the CMV promoter. However, TSA was unable to induce AR expression in cells engineered
to express AR from the SFFV promoter (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
To determine whether the increase in bioluminescence in
response to apoptotic inducing agents was specific for human
prostate carcinoma cell lines, we examined human breast
carcinoma (MDA.MB.231), mouse mammary carcinoma (4T1),
and mouse fibroblast (NIH/3T3) cells engineered to express CMVdriven luciferase with the same retroviral expression vector as
22Rv1-CMVluc and PC3-CMVluc cells (Fig. 2C). We also examined
MDA.MB.231 cells transiently transfected with either pCDNA3.1luc (CMV-driven luciferase) or pGL3 (SV40-driven luciferase;
Fig. 2D). For each of the cell lines engineered to express luciferase
under the control of the CMV promoter, optimized doses of
paclitaxel induced a significant increase in bioluminescence
compared with nontreated controls (Fig. 2C), although the
magnitude of this increase varied among these cell lines. In
contrast, MDA.MB.231 cells transiently expressing luciferase under
the control of the SV40 promoter did not show induction of
bioluminescence signal in response to drug treatment as we
observed for the 22Rv1 cell line. These data indicate that
paclitaxel induces bioluminescence in cells expressing luciferase
under the control of the CMV promoter, but not SV40 promoter.
This occurs in multiple cell lines and is independent of the
method in which the expression vector is introduced to these cells
(stably integrated retroviral vector or transient transfection of a
plasmid-based vector).

Bioluminescence can be induced by translation-independent and translation-dependent mechanisms. We observed a
transient increase in bioluminescence in all three human prostate
cancer cell lines using a high dose of staurosporine, but only 22Rv1CMVluc and PC3-CMVluc cell lines exhibited an increase in
bioluminescence in response to lower doses. To test whether
the increase in bioluminescence we observed was due to new
protein synthesis, possibly de novo luciferase production, we tested
the effects of 4 Amol/L staurosporine and 60 nmol/L staurosporine
on 22Rv1-CMVluc cells in the presence or absence of 10 Ag/mL
cycloheximide, a potent translation inhibitor. Figure 3A shows that
cycloheximide was unable to block the induction in bioluminescence signal by 4 Amol/L staurosporine, indicating that the increase
in bioluminescence from a 4-Amol/L dose of staurosporine does
not result from new protein synthesis. In contrast, Fig. 3B shows
that 10 Ag/mL cycloheximide blocked bioluminescence induction by a 60-nmol/L dose of staurosporine at 4 and 6 h posttreatment. These data indicate that different doses of staurosporine are
able to induce bioluminescence through two independent mechanisms: a translation-independent mechanism (at 4 Amol/L
staurosporine) and a translation-dependent mechanism (at
60 nmol/L staurosporine).
A previous study reported that arsenite treatment of cell lines
transfected with CMV-expressing constructs induces an increase in
transcription from the CMV promoter via activation of cellular
stress factors (20). 22Rv1-CMVluc and PC3-CMVluc cell lines have
been engineered to express luciferase through transduction with a
retroviral vector that expresses luciferase from an internal CMV
immediate early promoter with its proximal enhancer element

(herein referred to as CMV promoter) and contains a CMV/murine
sarcoma virus (MSV) hybrid promoter in the 5¶ long terminal
repeat (pQCXIN; BD Biosciences). In contrast, 22Rv1-SV40luc cells
are engineered to express luciferase through the stable integration
of a vector containing SV40 promoter-driven luciferase expression.
Because we did not observe an increase in bioluminescence in
22Rv1-SV40luc cells treated with varying doses of doxorubicin and
paclitaxel or low doses of staurosporine, we reasoned that these
agents are able to increase bioluminescence in 22Rv1-CMVluc and
PC3-CMVluc cells through a promoter-dependent mechanism. To
test this hypothesis, we examined whether the levels of luciferase
mRNA and protein were altered upon staurosporine and doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 3C and D and Supplementary Fig. S3A). We
treated both 22Rv1-CMVluc and 22Rv1-SV40luc cell lines with
either 4 Amol/L staurosporine for 1 h, 60 nmol/L staurosporine for
6 h, or 400 nmol/L doxorubicin for 48 h. To evaluate the levels of
luciferase mRNA, we did quantitative reverse transcription-PCR
(qRT-PCR) on RNA prepared from treated and untreated 22Rv1CMVluc and 22Rv1-SV40luc cells. Figure 3C shows that luciferase
mRNA levels are significantly increased when 22Rv1-CMVluc cells
are treated with 60 nmol/L staurosporine. Luciferase mRNA levels
were also significantly increased when 22Rv1-CMVluc cells were
treated with 400 nmol/L doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig. S3A).

However, although bioluminescence intensity was significantly
increased in cells treated with 4 Amol/L staurosporine, luciferase
mRNA levels actually decreased relative to the control 1 h after
treatment. Luciferase mRNA levels in staurosporine- and doxorubicin-treated 22Rv1-SV40luc cells were not significantly increased
compared with untreated control values. These findings indicate
that low doses of staurosporine and 400 nmol/L doxorubicin upregulate the synthesis of luciferase in cells where its expression is
controlled by the CMV promoter. We then prepared lysates from
treated and nontreated cells at the same time points as above and
analyzed luciferase activity in a cell-free assay. Figure 3D shows
that the levels of luciferase protein in 22Rv1-CMVluc cells are
significantly increased to f300% of control values upon low-dose
staurosporine treatment. Doxorubicin treatment also induced a
significant increase in luciferase protein in 22Rv1-CMVluc cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Strikingly, cell-free luciferase activity
was not significantly different in cells treated with 4 Amol/L of
staurosporine. 22Rv1-SV40luc cells did not show a difference in the
levels of luciferase activity compared with nontreated control cells.
Taken together, these data indicate an increase in luciferase
activity, subsequent to the up-regulation of the CMV promoter
when cells are treated with low doses of staurosporine and
400 nmol/L doxorubicin. However, high doses of staurosporine are

Chemotherapeutic Effects on Bioluminescence Imaging

able to increase bioluminescence by a mechanism that does not
involve up-regulation of the CMV promoter and is only apparent
when luciferase is in intact cells.
Doxorubicin treatment of subcutaneous luciferase-expressing
xenograft tumors leads to a transient increase in bioluminescence in vivo. To test whether we could extend our findings in cellbased assays to tumors in vivo, we employed a subcutaneous
xenograft model. Figure 4A shows that a single dose of doxorubicin
had a marked effect on tumor growth, with the average tumor
volume being 4-fold lower than PBS controls 10 days after
treatment. However, Fig. 4B shows that the bioluminescence signal
from the doxorubicin-treated animals was comparable to PBS
controls during this period. When bioluminescence is normalized
to tumor volume (photons/s/cm2/sr/mm3), there is an increase in
bioluminescence in the doxorubicin-treated group relative to the
PBS controls over a period of 10 days following treatment (Fig. 4C).
Images in Fig. 4C show examples of animals from these
doxorubicin and PBS (day 6 posttreatment) groups, where it is
clear that the smaller tumor (50 mm3) in the doxorubicin-treated
animal is emitting a bioluminescence signal comparable to the
larger tumor (220 mm3) in a PBS-treated animal. Figure 4C also
shows that the bioluminescence increase is transient. Twenty-three
days after treatment, both groups displayed similar normalized
values. This normalized value is modestly lower than when
treatment commenced, possibly due to necrosis in these tumors
or decreased efficiency in light penetration as the tumors grow
larger. In contrast, normalized bioluminescence signals were
similar throughout the time course among doxorubicin and PBStreated mice bearing xenografts derived from 22Rv1-SV40luc cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, these results parallel our observations of doxorubicin-induced increase in bioluminescence signal
from CMV-driven luciferase in vitro.
Inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway blocks doxorubicinand staurosporine-induced bioluminescence in 22Rv1-CMVluc
cells. The CMV promoter is complex and contains numerous
binding sites for transcription factors such as Sp-1, cyclic AMP–
responsive element binding protein/activating transcription factor
(CREB/ATF), and nuclear factor nB (NFnB), among others, which
are regulated by a variety of cell signaling pathways (21). To
determine which pathway(s) might be responsible for our
observations, we screened several small molecule inhibitors of
the NFnB, c-jun-NH2-kinase, and p38 MAPK pathways for their
ability to block doxorubicin-induced bioluminescence in 22Rv1CMVluc cells (data not shown). Only the p38 MAPK inhibitor
SB203580 was able to block bioluminescence induced by doxorubicin and staurosporine in 22Rv1-CMVluc cells. Figure 5A shows
that a 30-Amol/L dose of SB203580 was able to block f95% of the
bioluminescence induction by doxorubicin (at 48 h) or low-dose
staurosporine (at 24 h) in 22Rv1-CMVluc cells. We were also able to
block 95% of the bioluminescence induction by paclitaxel in PC3CMVluc cells (data not shown). Another p38 MAPK inhibitor,
SB202190, also significantly blocked bioluminescence induction by
doxorubicin and paclitaxel in 22Rv1-CMVluc cells, although to a
lesser degree than SB203580 (data not shown). These data suggest
that p38 MAPK is activated upon doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and lowdose staurosporine treatment and is able to up-regulate the CMV
promoter. To determine whether SB203580 was able to block the
bioluminescence induction through inhibiting the up-regulation of
the CMV promoter, we also prepared RNA from the treated cells and
did qRT-PCR for luciferase mRNA. Figure 5B shows that
doxorubicin treatment alone induced a 5-fold increase in luciferase

phosphorylated when cells are treated with doxorubicin. Taken
together, these results indicate that treatment with low-dose
staurosporine, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel induces a p38 MAPK
stress response that is responsible for the observed up-regulation of
the CMV promoter and increased bioluminescence signal.

Discussion
We found that the treatment of prostate cancer cell lines, which
stably express firefly luciferase from a CMV promoter with
apoptosis-inducing agents (staurosporine, doxorubicin, paclitaxel,
and TSA) induced a transient increase in bioluminescence even as
these cells were undergoing apoptosis. Of these three treatments,
only a high dose of staurosporine (4 Amol/L) was capable of
producing this same result in prostate cancer cells stably
expressing luciferase under the control of the SV40 promoter.
Lower doses of staurosporine (60 and 250 nmol/L) were only
capable of inducing bioluminescence in CMV luciferase-expressing
cells. Furthermore, cycloheximide treatment of cells expressing
CMV-driven luciferase abrogated the induction of bioluminescence
elicited by low doses (60 nmol/L) of staurosporine, while cotreatment of cycloheximide with high doses of staurosporine (4 Amol/L)
was unable to block bioluminescence induction; thus, we
concluded that the high-dose staurosporine induces bioluminescence through a promoter-independent mechanism and does not
require new protein synthesis. We also observed a transient
induction of bioluminescence in other, non–prostate cancer cell
lines stably expressing CMV-driven luciferase. Further investigations revealed that doxorubicin treatment of 22Rv1 cells induced
luciferase mRNA expression from the CMV promoter as well as
increased production of luciferase protein as measured by in vitro
luciferase assay, concomitant with increased bioluminescence
signal. These findings in cultured cells were extended in vivo;
treatment of mice bearing 22Rv1 xenografts with CMV- but not
SV40-driven luciferase with doxorubicin also resulted in a transient
increase in bioluminescence when normalized to tumor volume.
This observation resulted from the maintenance of relatively steady
mean bioluminescence values in tumors that were dramatically
reduced in volume in response to doxorubicin treatment; while
control tumors maintained a consistent relationship between
tumor volume and bioluminescence signal.
We considered several possibilities to explain these observations:
(a) these agents result in the production of reactive oxygen species
that affect the redox-sensitive bioluminescence reaction; (b)
apoptosis results in the temporal increase in cytosolic ATP levels,
increasing bioluminescence; (c) the expression of the luciferase
enzyme was increased. A previous study by Zamaraeva et al. (22)
reported a transient increase in bioluminescence from staurosporine, tumor necrosis factor-a–, and etoposide-treated cell lines
expressing luciferase under the control of the SV40 promoter
(pGL3 control vector, Promega). This group argued that cells
undergoing apoptosis exhibit an increase in cytosolic ATP, with
little increase in total cellular ATP, which rapidly and transiently
results in increased bioluminescence. Using the same high dose of
staurosporine, we showed that the induction of bioluminescence is
independent of promoter status and de novo protein synthesis.
Therefore, it is possible that ATP compartmentalization or other
effects on luciferase reaction components may be influencing the
light-generating reaction and driving the increase in bioluminescence. We also show that lower doses of staurosporine are able to
increase bioluminescence by a mechanism that is not explained by

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

an increase in cytosolic ATP. Our data show that this alternative
mechanism is dependent on de novo protein synthesis, and that the
increase in bioluminescence observed is due to the up-regulation of
the CMV promoter. Thus, we conclude that under the sets of
conditions studied, induction of bioluminescence occurs through
two independent mechanisms: (a) a promoter-independent mechanism, not requiring new protein synthesis; and (b) a promoterdependent mechanism, which requires de novo protein synthesis
and is associated with an increase in the steady-state levels of
luciferase mRNA and protein.
The CMV immediate early promoter with its proximal enhancer
is commonly employed to achieve high-level protein expression in
mammalian cells (21). However, this element is also known to be
responsive to a variety of stimuli that activate various signaling
pathways, including NFnB and p38 MAPK, among others, which are
involved in viral replication (23, 24). As a consequence of this
biology, when the CMV promoter is used to drive expression of
heterologous proteins, factors that engage those pathways such as
inflammatory cytokines or cell stress-related molecules may alter
the expression of proteins under its control (25). Previous studies
have shown that the CMV promoter activity is increased by NFnB
activation (26, 27). Because chemotherapeutic drugs have been
shown to activate the NFnB pathway in some cell types, we were
surprised to find that specific inhibitors of this pathway did not
block CMV-driven bioluminescence induction in doxorubicin- and
paclitaxel-treated prostate cancer cell lines. Rather, our studies
indicated that the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway was
responsible for activation of the CMV promoter. Consistent with
our findings, Bruening et al. (20) reported that a p38 MAPK
inhibitor completely blocked arsenite-induced up-regulation of the
CMV promoter. Previous studies have shown that p38 MAPK is
activated upon treatment with doxorubicin and paclitaxel (28, 29).
These studies also showed that inhibition of p38 MAPK reduced
doxorubicin- and paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, demonstrating an
important role for p38 MAPK in the apoptotic process. More
recently, Reinhardt et al. (30) also showed the importance of p38
MAPK activation in cell cycle checkpoint function after DNA
damage. We were able to block f95% of the bioluminescence
induction by doxorubicin and paclitaxel in 22Rv1 cells using a
specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK. p38 MAPK activates the
transcription factors CREB, ATF-2, and ETS-1, all of which have
binding sites within the CMV proximal enhancer and are required
for optimal HCMV replication. However, paclitaxel but not
doxorubicin, induced bioluminescence in PC-3 cells, indicating
that this response may be cell type-specific and/or dependent on
the genetic status of the cell type. Together, these results highlight
the complex regulation of the CMV promoter in response to
various cytokines, chemotherapeutics, and other stress-inducing
stimuli and suggest the likelihood that factors other than p38
MAPK may regulate the expression from this promoter, both
positively and negatively, in response to different treatments,
physiologic contexts, or in a cell type–specific manner.
Given that the CMV promoter has long been known to be
responsive to various stress-sensing pathways, it is not surprising
that the chemotherapeutic agents employed in this study (which
also engage similar pathways) would induce luciferase expression
driven by the CMV promoter. Therefore, this information is highly
relevant for designing and interpreting studies involving bioluminescence to assess tumor response to chemotherapeutics in mouse
models. Indeed, in the original paper describing BLI, the potential
problematic aspects of agents that affected constitutive promoters

driving luciferase expression were noted (2). We recapitulated our
in vitro observations in a subcutaneous tumor model. In response
to chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, 22Rv1-CMVluc xenografts
showed tumor regression as evaluated by traditional volume
measurements. However, during a period of 3 to 10 days following a
single dose of doxorubicin (8 mg/kg, i.v.), these tumors exhibited
bioluminescence signals comparable to PBS-treated control
tumors. Effectively, this treatment changed the relationship
between viable cell number and light output following treatment.
The duration of elevated bioluminescence was longer in vivo than
in vitro, >10 days versus <4 days, respectively. This could be due to
differences in drug exposure in tumors versus in vitro culture
conditions or other mechanisms such as inflammation in the
regressing tumor. In contrast, the light output from 22Rv1-SV40luc
xenografts did not appreciably change as a function of tumor
volume following doxorubicin treatment, although these tumors
also responded by a decrease in tumor volume, arguing that the
increased bioluminescence signal in 22Rv1-CMVluc xenografts did
not result from a drug-induced effect on the tumor microenvironment. Thus, these in vivo findings mirrored our in vitro findings,
suggesting that doxorubicin treatment induces a p38 MAPKdependent increase in luciferase expression from the CMVpromoter in 22Rv1-CMVluc xenografts.
These findings show that caution is warranted in the design and
interpretation of experiments involving BLI to assess tumor
response to chemotherapeutics in mouse models. A previous study
showed that paclitaxel treatment (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.) of PC-3
xenografts expressing luciferase under the control of the CMVpromoter resulted in decreased tumor weight in intramuscular
primary tumors, but luciferase activity measured in homogenates
from these tumors was not significantly different from control
treated animals (31). This led the authors to suggest that paclitaxel
was exerting its effects primarily on the tumor stroma, leading to
reduced tumor weight. Our results suggest an alternative possibility
that these results may be explained by paclitaxel up-regulation of
luciferase expression driven by the CMV promoter in these tumors.
Thus, care should be taken to evaluate the possible effects of drug
treatment on luciferase expression with in vitro studies and to
correlate BLI results with alternative measures of tumor growth. To

the extent that specific mechanisms can be related to the regulation
of the CMV promoter in tumor cells in vivo, this liability might also
be useful as a pharmacodynamic marker of drug effect. Specific
bioluminescent reporters have already been used successfully in
mice to evaluate drug effects in mice ( for example, ref. 8). Although
the SV40 promoter was not influenced by some drug treatments in
our experiments, we are reluctant to conclude that this will be the
case with other treatments in other contexts. The SV40 promoterdriven luciferase has been used successfully to measure
the response to chemotherapy in several previous studies (e.g.,
refs. 6, 32). In the case of studies involving the CMV-promoter, the
induction of bioluminescence may not have been observed due to
the cell lines or treatments involved or chosen imaging time points
may not have captured a transient increase in bioluminescence
signal (33). Treatments that dramatically and rapidly reduce tumor
burden would be expected to mask any potential up-regulation in
the CMV-promoter, although in this case, BLI may underestimate
drug efficacy. Future studies involving BLI of tumor response to
therapy should account for other effects on quantitation in vivo
such as changes in O2 levels and pharmacokinetics of luciferin
delivery to tumors, both of which may be affected by treatment and
have the potential to modify the resultant signal. BLI has become an
important tool for the development of sophisticated animal models
of cancer and other diseases, as well as providing quantitative
assessments of response to therapeutic interventions, and we
expect this to continue. However, our studies underscore the fact
that a biological process, the luciferase-mediated light-generating
reaction, is required to generate a signal in this imaging modality.
Therefore, one should carefully consider how other biological
processes or agents extrinsic to the light-generating reaction may
potentially affect the signal generated.
