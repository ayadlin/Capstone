Tumor Growth In Vivo

Abstract
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin currently with no cure. In this
study, we have ﬁrst demonstrated that c-Myc overexpression is common in MCC. By targeting c-Myc,
bromodomain inhibitors have demonstrated antitumor efﬁcacy in several preclinical human cancer models.
Thus, we interrogated the role of c-Myc inhibition in MCC with c-Myc ampliﬁcation by using the BET inhibitor
JQ1. We have uncovered that c-Myc can be regulated by JQ1 in MCC cells with pathologic c-Myc activation.
Moreover, JQ1 potently abrogates c-Myc expression in MCC cells and causes marked G1 cell-cycle arrest.
Mechanistically, JQ1-induced cell-cycle arrest coincides with downregulation of cyclin D1 and upregulation of
p21, p27, and p57, whereas JQ1 exerts no effect on apoptosis in MCC cells. Further knockdown of p21, p27, or p57
by shRNA partially protects cells from JQ1-induced cell-cycle arrest. In addition, c-Myc knockdown by shRNA
generates signiﬁcant cell-cycle arrest, suggesting that c-Myc overexpression plays a role in MCC pathogenesis.
Most importantly, JQ1 signiﬁcantly attenuates tumor growth in xenograft MCC mouse models. Our results
provide initial evidence, indicating the potential clinical utility of BET protein inhibitors in the treatment of MCC
with pathologic activation of c-Myc. Cancer Res; 74(23); 7090–102. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive skin tumor
of neuroendocrine origin with a rising incidence. Its 5-year
mortality rate is 46%, and there is no cure for metastatic
disease (1, 2). Although a causative link between Merkel cell
polyomavirus (MCV) and MCC has been proposed, the
cellular mechanisms involved in MCC pathogenesis remains
largely unknown (3, 4).
Interrogation of MCC tumors for mutations of both tumorsuppressor genes and oncogenes, such as p53, PTEN, Ras,
B-RAF, c-kit, and b-catenin, which are frequently mutated and
dysregulated in many cancers, have failed to reveal a consistent
signiﬁcant role for any of these genes in MCC (5, 6). Intriguingly, one study has shown that the MAPK pathway is silent,

as demonstrated by lack of pathway activation and no ERK
phosphorylation (7). Recently, PI3K/AKT and the mTOR pathway, the most commonly dysregulated pathway in human
cancer, are found to be upregulated in MCCs, though low
mutation rates of PI3K/Akt have been detected (8, 9). Interestingly, Paulson and colleagues (10) reported ampliﬁcation
of L-Myc in MCC by array-comparative genome hybridization (CGH) in 2008. Moreover, a recent study by Kwun and
colleagues (11) suggests that MCV small T antigen stabilizes
c-Myc expression by inhibiting the cellular ubiquitin ligase
protein complex, suggesting that c-Myc plays a role in MCC
pathogenesis.
c-Myc is a master regulator of cell proliferation and metabolism and is central to the pathogenesis of many human
cancers, by the coordinated upregulation of a transcriptional
program inﬂuencing metabolic adaptation, cell division, and
survival (12–14). c-Myc also promotes transformation and
maintenance of stem cells in genetically engineered mouse
models of glioblastoma (15–17). Furthermore, conditional
transgenic models featuring tunable transcriptional suppression have shown that even transient inactivation of Myc results
in sustained regression of tumors (17). However, therapies
directly targeting Myc hyperactivation are not currently available in the clinic.
Members of the bromodomains and extraterminal (BET)
domain family of proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and Brdt) are
associated with acetylated chromatin and facilitate transcriptional activation through increasing the effective molarity of
recruited transcriptional activators (18). BET proteins primarily bind to the transcriptional start sites of genes expressed
during mitosis and affect the transcription of growth- and
survival-promoting genes (19, 20). Recently, an RNAi screen has

JQ1 Suppresses MCC Xenograft Tumor Growth

discovered that knockdown of BRD4 leads to downregulation of c-Myc in acute myelogenous leukemia (21). Subsequently, small-molecule compounds with high potency
against BET proteins, such as JQ1, I-BET151, iBET762, and
MS417, have been developed (22, 23). Through epigenetic
mechanism, they repress downstream gene expression by
competitively binding to BET proteins and displacing BET
proteins from acetylated lysines on chromatin. Notably,
c-Myc transcription is associated locally and globally with
increases in histone lysine side-chain acetylation (18, 19, 22).
Consistent with this model, inhibition of BET protein with
JQ1 results in signiﬁcant downregulation of c-Myc and antitumor activity in several hematopoietic malignancies as well
as in NUT midline carcinoma (24–35). Thus, BET protein
inhibitors are currently in phase I and II clinical trials for
advanced malignancies.
Despite two previously published studies, the role of
c-Myc in MCC pathogenesis remains poorly deﬁned. In this
study, we have revealed that c-Myc overexpression is common in MCC fresh tumors examined and primary human
MCC cell lines. c-Myc inhibition by the BET protein inhibitor
JQ1 induces cell-cycle arrest and decreased MCC cell proliferation. Most importantly, JQ1 signiﬁcantly attenuated
xenograft tumor growth in vivo. Thus, our results establish
the therapeutic rationale for BET protein inhibitors in the
management of MCC with pathologic activation of c-Myc.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
In accordance with institutional approvals for the human
study protocol, we have established three primary human MCC
cell lines (MCC-2, MCC-3, and MCC-5) derived from lymph
node metastases of 3 patients with MCC as previously
described (36, 37). Primary MCC cells were cultured with
RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 10% penicillin–streptomycin L-glutamine and incubated at 37 C in a
humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2. Fresh medium was added
every other day.
Reagents
Human embryonic kidney (293T/17; ATCC) cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 5 mg/mL of
sodium pyruvate. The following antibodies were used for
immunoblotting analyses or IHC: c-Myc, b-actin, and cleaved
caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology); BRD4, p21, p27, p57, and
cyclinD1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Additional reagents
used in the study include: TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent
(Mirus), puromycin, polybrene, ﬁbronectin, and 1xRIPA buffer
(Sigma-Aldrich), enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagent (Millipore) and staurosporine (Selleck Chemicals).
Immunohistochemistry
Brieﬂy, 5-mm parafﬁn sections were deparafﬁnized with
xylene and graded ethanol, and antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving in 0.01 mol/L sodium citrate for 20
minutes. Endogenous tissue peroxidase activity was blocked
with 1% hydrogen peroxide at room temperature (RT) for 1

www.aacrjournals.org

hour. The sections were further blocked with normal goat or
horse serum at RT for 1 hour following incubation with primary
antibody dilution at 4 C overnight. Secondary antibody was
applied to the slides for 1 hour at RT before developing in
the horseradish peroxidase detection system and freshly prepared diaminobenzidine as the chromogen (brown). Sections
were counterstained with hematoxylin. Immunostained slides
were viewed on an Olympus BX51 Research System Microscope by 20 and 40 UPlanApo air objective lenses (Olympus
America). Images were photographed using a high-resolution
interline CCD camera (CoolSNAP cf; Photometrics), and
acquired with automated microscopy acquisition software
(MetaMorph version 7.7; Molecular Devices).
Gene-expression analysis
Total RNA was isolated from primary MCC cell lines and MCC
fresh tissues with the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated
from mRNA using the Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-time-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed
with a StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The following TaqMan Gene Expression Assays primers
were used: Hs00905030_m1 (c-Myc), Hs00355782_m1 (p21),
Hs01597588_m1 (p27), Hs00175938_m1 (p57), Hs00211334_m1
(MRPS2) and Hs00765553_m1 (cyclin D1), Hs01062014_m1
(Notch1), Hs00765730_m1 (NFkB). Triplicate runs of each sample were normalized to MRPS2 mRNA to determine relative
expression.
Immunoblotting
Cultured cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in
1RIPA buffer containing 1 mmol/L DTT and Complete Mini
EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail. After incubation on ice
for 30 minutes, the cell lysates were clariﬁed by centrifugation
at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C. Ten to 30 mg of total
protein was subjected to 8% or 12% SDS-PAGE gels and
transferred electrophoretically onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
membrane by a semidry blotting system (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked in 5% fat-free milk/Tris–buffered saline
0.1% Tween 20 for 1 hour at RT and incubated with primary
antibodies at 4 C overnight, followed by secondary antibodies
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Then the membrane was subjected to Western blot
analysis with ECL detection reagent. The xenograft tumor
tissue was homogenized in 2% SDS lysis buffer and then
processed for Western blotting as described above.
MCV detection
DNA was prepared using the DNeasy Kit (Qiagen). DNA
quality was conﬁrmed by GAPDH. PCR was performed with
120 ng of genomic DNA using the Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen) in a ﬁnal volume of 50 mL for 30 to 35 cycles.
Primer sets for LT3 and MCPVS1 were used as published
previously (36).
Cell proliferation and viability assays
Cell proliferation analysis was performed using the Cell
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8 kit; Sigma) and manually cell counting. MCC cell lines were plated at 1  104 cells per well in

96-well plates, allowed to recover for 3 hours and then
exposed to serial concentrations of JQ1 (Selleck Chemicals)
for 24, 48, 72, and 120 hours, respectively. CCK-8 (10 mL) was
added to each well and incubated at 37 C for another 4 hours
before measuring using a spectrophotometer at 450 nm.
MCC cell lines were plated at 10  104 cells per well in 6-well
plates, allowed to recover for 3 hours, and then exposed to
serial concentration of JQ1 (Selleck Chemicals) for 24, 48, 72,
and 120 hours, respectively. Cells were collected at different
time points and counted manually with trypan blue exclusion staining (ViCell; Beckman Coulter).
Methylcellulose colony assay
MCC cells clonogenic formation was assayed by culturing
MCC cells in complete methylcellulose (Methocult GFþ
H4435; STEMCELL Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Brieﬂy, MCC cells (3,000 cells) were
resuspended in 1 mL complete methylcellulose with JQ1
(800 nmol/L) or vehicle, and incubated in a humidiﬁed
incubator. Colony formation was assayed after 21 days in
culture by microscopy. Colonies consisting of at least 40 cells
were counted.
Apoptosis and cell-cycle analysis
Apoptosis was detected by ﬂow cytometry using Annexin
V–FITC according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences). Brieﬂy, MCC cells (1  106 cells) were plated in
6-well plates for 3 hours followed by treatment with JQ1 for
72 hours before Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI)
staining (BD Biosciences FACS Aria). Cells were resuspended in the binding buffer with only Annexin V or PI
served as controls. For each dye, appropriate electronic
compensation of the instrument was performed to avoid
overlapping of the two emission spectra. For cell-cycle
analysis, MCC cells (1  106 cells) were seeded in 6-well
plates for 3 hours followed by treatment with JQ1 for 72
hours and then were labeled with 10 mmol/L bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 2 hours. BrdUrd incorporation was
detected using Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated mouse antiBrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences-Pharmingen) followed by
7-AAD staining (BD Biosciences-Pharmingen) for cell-cycle
analysis per the manufacturer's protocol.
Lentiviral transduction
Lentivector directing expression of shRNA speciﬁc
to p21 (TRCN0000040123), p27 (TRCN0000009856), p57
(TRCN0000010484), and c-Myc (TRCN0000039642) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and nontargeting PLKO.1 scramble shRNA (plasmid 1864) was purchased from Addgene. To
generate lentivirus media, 293T/17 cells were cotransfected
with gene transfer vectors and virus packaging vectors DH8.2
and VSVG by TransIT-LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus). Two
days following transfection, viral supernatants were collected and MCC cells were transduced with viral supernatant for
48 hours in ﬁbronectin-coated 6-well plates in the presence
of 8 mg/mL polybrene after spinoculation at 800  g, 32 C for
30 minutes. Cells were then selected in culture media containing 2 mg/mL puromycin for at least 48 hours.

Xenograft implantation
Five-week-old female immunodeﬁcient NOD/SCID/IL2rgnull (NSG) mice (The Jackson Laboratory; Strain #005557)
were used for generating xenograft mouse models. Tumor cells
were prepared by suspending 2  107 MCC cells in 80 mL of
media þ 120 mL of Matrigel (BD Biosciences; catalog no.
#354248) and inoculated on right rear ﬂanks. Palpable tumor
growth appeared within 3 to 5 days of inoculation, and
treatment per protocol began when tumors reached approximately 100 mm3 in volume.
In vivo drug study
Tumor-bearing mice were randomized into treatment and
control groups (n  7 for each condition) and began receiving
i.p. injection administration of vehicle (10% 2-hydroxypropylb-cyclodextrin in water) or 50 mg/kg/d JQ1 for 3 weeks
duration. Mice were monitored daily, tumor xenografts were
measured with digital calipers, and tumor volume was calculated as L2  W/2, where L is length and W is width. All animal
experiments were done under a protocol approved by the
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
In accordance with institutional guidelines on animal care,
experimental endpoints were determined by one of the following: (i) completion of 21-day treatment course, or (ii)
attainment of tumor burden exceeding 2 cm in any dimension,
or (iii) further complications affecting animal welfare. Upon
reaching experimental endpoints, mice were humanely euthanized, and tumors were excised and dissected for characterization and mechanistic studies.
Statistical analysis
All the measurements were made in triplicate, and all
values are represented as mean  SD. Statistical analysis was
performed with the Student t test or one-way ANOVA;  , a
P value of <0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

c-Myc overexpression is common in MCC tumors and
primary MCC cell lines
c-Myc is a transcription factor that not only regulates the
expression of many genes crucial for cell proliferation and
differentiation, it is also one of the most prevalent oncogenes deregulated in human cancers (13, 38). Interestingly,
an array-CGH study revealed ampliﬁcation of a region
harboring L-Myc in MCC (10). Thus, we were compelled to
examine c-Myc expression in MCC fresh tumors. We found
that 87.5% (14/16) of MCCs overexpressed c-Myc as compared with normal skin by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A). Our
ﬁndings conﬁrm a recent publication, suggesting that MCV
small T antigen contributes to c-Myc overexpression (11).
To see whether c-Myc overexpression correlates with MCV
status, DNAs were extracted from MCC fresh tumors and
MCV was detected as described previously (36). As shown
in Fig. 1B, six MCC samples that were negative for MCV also
possessed c-Myc overexpression. Intriguingly, two MCV–
positive MCC (Tumor-10 and Tumor-15) failed to demonstrate c-Myc ampliﬁcation. Thus, c-Myc overexpression in

JQ1 Suppresses MCC Xenograft Tumor Growth

mRNA expression of target genes in

MCC tumors was independent of MCV status in our study.
Next, we assessed c-Myc expression in three primary MCC
cell lines established in our laboratory. MCC-2, MCC-3, and
MCC-5 cell lines have been described previously (37, 39).
Primary MCC cells grow in cluster in cultures and display
large, round to oval, vesicular nuclei with scant cytoplasm
that are characteristic of MCC (Supplementary Fig. S1). As
shown in Fig. 1C, both MCC-3 and MCC-5 overexpressed
c-Myc at the mRNA and protein levels, but discernible
expression of c-Myc was detected in MCC-2 cells. We next
wanted to determine the cell growth properties among these
three primary MCC cell lines. Cell proliferation was assessed
by cell counting manually. A shown in Fig. 1D, MCC-3 and
MCC-5 cells with c-Myc overexpression possessed higher
cell proliferation as compared with MCC-2 cells. Therefore,
we have demonstrated that c-Myc overexpression is common in MCC tumors and it is independent of MCV. Moreover, primary MCC cells with c-Myc overexpression carry a
higher proliferation rate.

BET inhibitor JQ1 abolishes c-Myc expression and
represses primary MCC cell proliferation
Targeting c-Myc by the BET inhibitor JQ1 has demonstrated efﬁcient suppression of c-Myc expression as well as
antitumor activity in many types of human cancer both
in vitro and in vivo (28, 32). We therefore decided to examine
the effects of growth inhibition by JQ1 in MCC cells. On the
basis of the published studies, there is a wide range of IC50
of JQ1 used (200 nmol/L–5 mmol/L; refs. 25, 31). However,
IC50 for most hematopoietic tumor cell lines are between 500
and 1,000 nmol/L and the duration of treatment was
between 3 and 5 days. Thus, we decided to test JQ1 at a
series of concentration between 200 and 800 nmol/L and at
24, 48, and 72 hours. In agreement with other published
ﬁndings, a signiﬁcant reduction of c-Myc expression was
found after JQ1 treatment in both MCC-3 and MCC-5 cells
(Fig. 2A). A time- and dose-dependent inhibition of MCC cell
proliferation was observed after JQ1 treatment as determined by CCK-8 assay and manual counting (Fig. 2B).

Figure 2. The BET protein inhibitor JQ1 reduces c-Myc expression and attenuates primary MCC cell proliferation. A, decreased c-Myc expression in
MCC-3 and MCC-5 treated with JQ1 (800 nmol/L) for 72 hours by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. The mRNA expression of target genes was
normalized to that of MRPS2 and a value of 1.0 was assigned to the mRNA expression of target genes in the control group (means  SEM;   , P < 0.01
vs. control); b-actin was used as a loading control for immunoblotting. B, MCC-3 and MCC-5 cells are sensitive to JQ1 inhibition. MCC cell lines
(MCC-3 and MCC-5) were cultured with JQ1 at different concentrations (200, 400, and 800 nmol/L) for 24, 48, 72, and 120 hours, respectively
(means  SEM;  , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001 vs. control). C, decreased colony formation in MCC-3 and MCC-5 cells treated with JQ1
(800 nmol/L) compared with that of DMSO control. A total of 3,000 cells were mixed with methylcellulose medium with JQ1 (800 nmol/L) or DMSO and
the mixture was plated in each 35-mm dish for 21 days at 37 C (means  SEM;   , P < 0.001 vs. control); scale bars, 200 mm.

Consistent with our hypothesis, a greater inhibition was
found in MCC-3 and MCC-5 cells with c-Myc overexpression.
Interestingly, a growth inhibition of MCC-2 cells was found
with a higher concentration of JQ1 (800 nmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S4A). After 72 hours treatment and at the
lowest tested dosage of JQ1 (200 nmol/L), we observed
approximately 20% of growth inhibition in MCC-3 and
MCC-5, whereas MCC-2 cells were almost entirely unaffected. At the highest dosage of JQ1 (800 nmol/L) after 72 hours
treatment, we observed >50% of growth inhibition in MCC-3
and MCC-5 as compared with 10% inhibition in MCC-2 cells
(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Although we observed

7094

suppression of cell growth in MCC cells without c-Myc
overexpression by JQ1, in this study, we decided to focus
on the biologic effects of c-Myc inhibition in MCC cell lines
(MCC-3 and MCC-5) possessing c-Myc ampliﬁcation.
Because a 50% inhibition of growth was seen in both MCC
cell lines at 800 nmol/L concentrations of JQ1 after 72 hours
treatment, we chose JQ1 at the concentration of 800 nmol/L
for all studies carried out in this article. To evaluate the
effect of long-term inhibition by JQ1, colony formation
assay was performed. Similar to the results above, JQ1
(800 nmol/L) signiﬁcantly decreased the number of colony
formation in MCC cells compared with that of controls

(Fig. 2C). Our data suggest that BET inhibition has potent
antiproliferative effects in MCC cells with c-Myc overexpression in vitro.
JQ1-induced cell-cycle arrest is via upregulation of p21,
p27, and p57 in MCC cell lines
To further investigate the growth inhibitory mechanisms
of JQ1 on MCC, we evaluated the effects of JQ1 on cell-cycle
progression and apoptosis by ﬂow cytometry. Both MCC-3
and MCC-5 cells treated with JQ1 at 800 nmol/L for 72 hours
were collected and subjected to BrdUrd cell-cycle or Annexin
V/PI analysis, respectively. Consistent with the antiproliferative effects of JQ1, a pronounced decrease of cells in S
phase with a concomitant increase in cells in G0–G1 phase
was observed in treated groups as compared with that in
the control groups (Fig. 3A), suggesting a cell-cycle arrest
at the G0–G1 phase. Further assessment of the involvement
of the cell-cycle target genes, downregulation of cell-cycle
promoter gene cyclin D1, and upregulation of negative cellcycle regulator genes p21, p27 and p57 was detected at the
RNA and protein levels after JQ1 treatment in both MCC-3
and MCC-5 cells (Fig. 3B). To further elucidate which cellcycle–negative regulatory proteins contribute to cell-cycle
arrest by JQ1, we have successfully abolished expression
of p21, p27, or p57 by shRNA in MCC cells, respectively
(Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S4B). Interestingly, individ-

ual knockdown of p21, p27, or p57 expression partially
rescued JQ1-induced cell-cycle arrest to a similar degree,
which suggested that JQ1-induced suppressed proliferation
is mainly due to upregulation of p21, p27, and p57 (Fig. 4B
and C). Of note, JQ1 failed to induce apoptosis in MCC
cells, as demonstrated by Annexin V study (Supplementary
Fig. S2A and S2B). MCC cells treated with staurosporine
(1 mmol/L) for 4 hours served as positive controls.

c-Myc knockdown is sufﬁcient to recapitulate the
antitumor effect of JQ1 in MCC cells
To conﬁrm whether c-Myc is the major effector of JQ1
inhibition in MCC cells, we next depleted c-Myc expression
by shRNA followed by JQ1 treatment. Successful knockdown of c-Myc expression by shRNA in MCC cells is shown
in Fig. 5A and B. Similarly, c-Myc knockdown caused a
signiﬁcant reduction of cells in S phase that was associated
with G1 arrest (Fig. 5C and D). Cells in S phase reduced
from 21% to 2.2% in MCC-3 cells, and from 19.2% to 1.3%
in MCC-5 cells. Moreover, there was no additive effect by
JQ1 treatment in c-Myc knockdown cells, suggesting that

diameter), treatment was started with as per the standard
treatment protocol as previously published (31). NSG
mice bearing xenograft tumors began to receive i.p. administration of 50 mg/kg/d JQ1 or vehicle for a 3-week duration. NSG mice bearing MCC-5 xenograft tumors were
sacriﬁced after completion of 21-day treatment. However,
NSG mice bearing MCC-3 tumors were terminated at day 19
because control tumors were reaching 2 cm in dimension.
Mice treated with JQ1 had no obvious signs of toxicity
(based on body weight, food and water intake, activity, and
general exam). As shown in Fig. 6A, xenograft tumors
receiving JQ1 treatment showed great reductions of tumor volume as compared with xenograft tumors receiving
vehicle. Histologically, xenograft tumor cells demonstrated
large, round to oval, vesicular nuclei with scant cytoplasm,
which is characteristic of MCC (Fig. 6A). As measured by
mean  SEM, JQ1 signiﬁcantly attenuated xenograft tumor

we decided to examine whether the mTOR pathway is downstream of c-Myc in MCC cells. Interestingly, both p-mTOR
and p-4E-BP1 were unchanged after JQ1 treatment, suggesting
that 4E-BP1 is not regulated by c-Myc in MCC-3 and MCC-5
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
JQ1 impaired MCC xenograft tumor growth in vivo
We proceeded to test the impact of JQ1 on MCC cells in
our xenograft MCC mouse models. To strengthen our
hypothesis that c-Myc was the major downstream effector
of JQ1 in MCC cells, we included MCC-2 cells without c-Myc
ampliﬁcation as controls. MCC-2, MCC-3, and MCC-5 cells
(2  107 cells from each cell line) were mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences; 80 mL of media þ 120 mL of Matrigel),
respectively. Tumor cells were inoculated subcutaneously

growth (more than a 4-fold reduction in MCC-3 xenograft
tumors and a 3-fold reduction in MCC-5 xenograft tumors; Fig. 6B). This was accompanied by prolonged
event-free survival as tumor in the treatment group never
attained 600 and 1,100 mm3 in MCC-3 and MCC-5 tumors,
respectively. Consistent with our central hypothesis, MCC-3
cells with highest c-Myc expression correlates with the
greatest reduction (>4-fold) in MCC-3 xenograft tumor
volume. Conversely, MCC-2 xenograft tumors lacking c-Myc
ampliﬁcation are less sensitive to JQ1 (>1-fold reduction).
By RT-PCR analysis, xenograft tumors showed consistent
expression pattern of MCC markers, such as cytokeratin 18,
19, 20, synaptophysin, neurospeciﬁc enolase, and Merkel
cell-speciﬁc transcription factor Math-1 as expressed in
MCC cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Immunoblotting analysis further conﬁrmed suppressed c-Myc expression and
upregulation of p21, p27, and p57 in the treatment groups
(Fig. 6C). As expected, decreased cell proliferation as determined by IHC staining of Ki67, was found in the xenograft
tumors in the treatment group as compared with those
in the control group (Fig. 7). Similarly, increased numbers
of p21-, p27-, and p57-positive cells were found in xenograft
tumors in the treatment group by IHC (Fig. 7). Although
our in vivo data are promising, it is generated in NSG
mice with profound immune deﬁciency. In addition, JQ1
can potentially interact with several immune-related pathways. Nevertheless, our data provide initial evidence that
the BET protein inhibitor JQ1 might be applicable in the
clinic for MCC.

Discussion
MCC is an aggressive skin cancer. Standard treatment is
surgery followed by radiotherapy for local and regional
disease or chemotherapy for distant metastasis (43). Despite
standard treatment, one third of patients will eventually
develop distant metastases, for which currently there is no
cure. Therefore, molecular events driving MCC pathogenesis
need to be further deﬁned to beneﬁt heterogeneous patient
populations. In search of receptor tyrosine kinase involvement in MCC tumorigenesis (providing a rationale for the
use of targeted molecular therapies), studies have found
variable expression of c-kit, VEGFs, PDGFa, and PDGFb in
MCC compared with normal skin (44–46). Although a hyperactivated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is reported in MCC
(8, 9, 39), the etiology of this aberrant pathway activation
is still elusive. Because c-Myc represents a unifying molecular feature in many hematopoietic malignancies (12) and
ampliﬁcation of L-Myc is reported in MCC (10), we were
intrigued to study c-Myc. Interestingly, while we were conducting this study, an article published by Kwun and colleagues (11) suggests that MCV small T antigen stabilizes cMyc expression. However, the role of c-Myc overexpression
in MCC pathogenesis still needs further elucidation. Consistent with the central role of Myc in the pathogenesis of
human cancer, we are the ﬁrst to report that c-Myc activation is common in MCC.
Although c-Myc is one of the most deregulated oncogenes
in human cancers, a therapeutic approach to target c-Myc

has remained elusive. Like many transcriptional targets, the
lack of a ligand-binding domain creates an obstacle toward
direct inhibition (47). BETs are transcriptional regulators
that epigenetically control gene expression, which are key
in cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, and apoptosis
(22, 23). Dysfunction of BET proteins has been associated
with the development of aggressive tumors, such as NUT
midline carcinomas (26, 48). Recently developed selective
BET protein inhibitors are attractive because of promising
antitumor activity demonstrated in diverse preclinical models, such as multiple myeloma (31), hematologic malignancies (21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 32), glioblastoma (30), lung cancer
(29, 33), and meduloblastoma (49). The efﬁcacy of these
compounds has been attributed mainly to their ability to
suppress c-Myc expression as well as downstream targets.
On the basis of these prior studies, BET inhibitors would
be expected to have activity primarily against MCC possessing higher expression of c-Myc at the transcription level.
In agreement with this notion, we have uncovered G1 cellcycle arrest by JQ1 in MCC cells with c-Myc ampliﬁcation,
particularly via suppressed c-Myc expression, downregulation of cyclin D1, and upregulation of cell-cycle inhibitors
such as p21, p27, and p57 in JQ1-treated MCC cells. Moreover, knockdown of p21, p27, and p57 partially reverts JQ1induced G0–G1 arrest in MCC cells. Interestingly, individual
knockdown of p21, p27, and p57 exhibits the same extent
of neutralization of JQ1 effect in MCC cells. Although JQ1
fails to confer cell death in MCC cells, this is unlikely due to
the lower concentration used (800 nmol/L as compared with
1 mmol/L used in studies using models of hematopoietic
malignancies). Thus, BET inhibition may have synergistic
effects with targeted proapoptotic agents (e.g., ABT-737 and
YM155) in the clinical setting.
Of note, several reports have demonstrated off-target
effects on genes or signaling pathways by JQ1 in addition
to c-Myc, such as TYRO3, prosurvival gene BIRC5/survivin,
NFkB target gene BIRC3, and JAK/STAT pathway gene IL7R.
Because of the strong concordance between the phenotypes
by c-Myc knockdown and JQ1, it is most likely that c-Myc is
the major gene involved in JQ1-induced cell-cycle arrest in
MCC cells with c-Myc overexpression. Because expression of
Notch1 and NFkB is increased in both MCC-3 and MCC-5
cells upon JQ1 treatment, they are less likely to be involved in
JQ1-induced cell-cycle arrest. Importantly, the greatest suppression of xenograft tumor by JQ1 is evident in MCC-3 cells
with the highest c-Myc expression. Of note, MCC-2 cells
without c-Myc ampliﬁcation also confers JQ1 sensitivity at a
higher concentration, suggesting alternative mechanisms in
growth inhibition in MCC cells without c-Myc overexpression. Intriguingly, unlike previous publications demonstrating that the mTOR pathway and c-Myc converge at 4E-BP1,
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 are not regulated by JQ1 in our
experimental system (42).
It is controversial to whether BET protein levels are altered
when cells are subjected to JQ1 (31). In our study, BRD4
expression at the protein level is unchanged in both MCC-3
and MCC-5 cells after JQ1 treatment, which is consistent with
the theory that JQ1 competitively displaces BRD4 from chro-

7100

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

matin without changing its level (data not shown). Interestingly, BRD4 expression is found to be higher in metastatic
melanoma (26). It is debatable whether knockdown of BRD4 is
able to phenocopy the antitumor effects of BET inhibitors in
different cell types. Therefore, the concomitant displacement
of other BET proteins may broaden the oncosuppression
effects of these small-molecule compounds despite the fact
that BRD4 is the key BET protein, which has been studied
extensively so far. It would be compelling to explore the
biologic consequence of complete abrogation of BET proteins
not only in MCC with c-Myc ampliﬁcation but also in MCC
lacking Myc ampliﬁcation.
It is evidential that epigenetic modiﬁcation affects cancer
initiation and progression. Of note, new small-molecule drugs
modifying the epigenetic landscape of tumors have improved
disease overall survival as well as potentiate the cytotoxic
effects of chemotherapy (50). Here, we have demonstrated
that epigenetic inhibition of c-Myc by JQ1 retards tumor
growth in xenograft MCC mouse models with no obvious
toxicity, which establishes the feasibility of c-Myc inhibition
by BET protein inhibitors within an acceptable therapeutic
window of tolerability as a single agent or in combination with
other therapies in holding disease progression in check. However, BET protein inhibitors may be most effective when used
in combination with agents possessing cytotoxicity in the
clinical setting for MCC. Insights provided by our study identify
BET protein inhibitors as rational therapeutic options and
warrant further exploration in MCC with and without pathologic c-Myc activation.
