ABSTRACT:
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a B cell malignancy characterized by clonal proliferation
of plasma cells in the bone marrow. With the advent of novel targeted agents, the
median survival rate has increased to 5 -7 years. However, majority of patients with
myeloma suffer relapse or develop chemoresistance to existing therapeutic agents.
Thus, there is a need to develop novel alternative therapies for the treatment of
MM. Thus in the present study, we investigated whether thymoquinone (TQ), a
bioactive constituent of black seed oil, could suppress the proliferation and induce
chemosensitization in human myeloma cells and xenograft mouse model. Our results
show that TQ inhibited the proliferation of MM cells irrespective of their sensitivity
to doxorubicin, melphalan or bortezomib. Interestingly, TQ treatment also resulted
in a significant inhibition in the proliferation of CD138+ cells isolated from MM
patient samples in a concentration dependent manner. TQ also potentiated the
apoptotic effects of bortezomib in various MM cell lines through the activation of
caspase-3, resulting in the cleavage of PARP. TQ treatment also inhibited chemotaxis
and invasion induced by CXCL12 in MM cells. Furthermore, in a xenograft mouse
model, TQ potentiated the antitumor effects of bortezomib (p < 0.05, vehicle versus
bortezomib + TQ; p < 0.05, bortezomib versus bortezomib + TQ), and this correlated
with modulation of various markers for survival and angiogenesis, such as Ki-67,
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Bcl-2 and p65 expression. Overall, our
results demonstrate that TQ can enhance the anticancer activity of bortezomib in vitro
and in vivo and may have a substantial potential in the treatment of MM.

INTRODUCTION

is thought to be activation of master transcription factor
NF-κB and dysregulation of apoptosis [11, 12]. Many
studies have shown that the NF-κB signaling pathway
plays an important role in anti-apoptosis and the drug
resistance of tumor cells during chemotherapy. First, many
chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy induce NF-κB
expression in vitro and in vivo [12, 13]. Second, activation
of NF-κB rescues cells from chemotherapy induced
apoptosis [14]. Third, induction of chemoresistance and
radioresistance is mediated via genes regulated by NF-κB
[12]. Fourth, inhibition of NF-κB and NF-κB regulated
gene products increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to
apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents and to
radiation exposure [12, 15]. Activation of NF-κB in MM
cells induces proliferation, survival and chemoresistance.
When compared to chemosensitive MM cell lines
chemoresistant MM cells express higher levels of NF-κB,
suggesting a link between NF-κB and development of
chemoresistance [15]. Thus targeting deregulated NF-κB
activation can be an important strategy pharmacological
strategy to overcome chemoresistance in MM patients.
Hence, in the present study we investigated whether
thymoquinone (2-isopropyl-5- methyl-1,4-benzoquinone,
TQ) can significantly augment the apoptotic effects
of bortezomib, both under in vitro system and in vivo
conditions using human MM cells and xenograft mouse
model. We focused specifically on TQ as it has been
shown to possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antihypertensive and anti-neoplastic effects in various tumor
cells including MM through the modulation of diverse
oncogenic molecular targets [12, 16-18]. We report
for the first time that TQ inhibited the growth of MM
U266 tumors in a subcutaneous mouse model, and that
combination of TQ with bortezomib further inhibited
tumor growth through the modulation of various markers
of proliferation, survival and angiogenesis.

Cancer is a major public health problem worldwide.
According to World Cancer Research Fund International,
there were an estimated 12.7 million cancer deaths (13%
of all deaths) worldwide in 2008, males accounting for
6.6 million and females accounting for 6 million. Multiple
myeloma (MM) is a B cell malignancy involving the
post germinal center B cells. The disease is characterized
by clonal proliferation and accumulation of terminally
differentiated plasma cells that produce immunoglobulin
[1], presence of blood and urinary monoclonal proteins,
osteolytic bone lesions, infiltration of bone marrow with
malignant plasma cells [2]. Generally, MM is preceded
by two premalignant conditions namely monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and
smoldering (asymptomatic) multiple myeloma (SMM)
[3, 4]. MM is the second most common hematological
malignancy next only to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
contributing 13% of all malignancies and 1% of all
neoplasias [5].
Common front line agents used in the induction
therapy of MM are either two drug or three drug
combinations of melphalan, dexamethasone, thalidomide,
lenalidomide and bortezomib [6]. Bortezomib, a novel
dipeptide boronate, was the first therapeutic proteasome
inhibitor to be tested in humans. The regimens available
for the treatment of relapsed and refractory MM are
carfilzomib, bortezomib, thalidomide-dexamethasone and
lenalidomide-bendamustine-dexamethasone combination
[7]. Pomalidomide, a third generation immunomodulatory
agent has also been recently approved by the FDA for
the treatment of relapsed and refractory MM [8]. The
introduction of novel drugs that target specific intracellular
pathways and affect cellular interactions within the
tumor microenvironment, have significantly aided in the
clinical management of MM patients. However, MM still
remains incurable as majority of the patients suffer from
relapse after initial response or develop chemoresistance.
Moreover, most of the available drugs have severe doselimiting toxicity including but not limited to bone marrow
suppression, peripheral neuropathy, and reactivation of
herpes zoster infection [9]. Thus, there remains an unmet
need to develop novel therapies for MM treatment.
Resistance to chemotherapy remains a major
therapeutic challenge in MM. Several biological
mechanisms are implicated in chemoresistance, including
multidrug resistance (MDR1/P-glycoprotein [P-gp]
or p170), resistance-related proteins (p95 and p110),
multidrug resistance-associated protein (p190), proteins
implicated in cell detoxification such as glutathione
S-transferase and genes affecting DNA structure
(topoisomerases) [10]. The precise mechanism underlying
chemoresistance in MM is not clear, but one of the main
contributors to both chemoresistance and pathogenesis

RESULTS
In this study we investigated whether TQ can
sensitize MM cells to bortezomib, a clinically used
proteasome inhibitor, and the underlying molecular
mechanisms involved. To determine the tumor growth
inhibition under in vivo conditions, we used a xenograft
mouse model. The structure of TQ is shown in Fig. 1A.

Anti-proliferative effects of TQ on human MM
cell lines and patient samples
Anti-myeloma effect of TQ was evaluated by
assessing the cell viability of different MM cell lines
resistant to various pharmacological drugs. Specifically,
we investigated the effect of TQ on RPMI-8226, RPMI8226-Dox6 (resistant to doxorubicin), RPMI 8226-LR5

(resistant to melphalan), and RPMI-8226-BR (bortezomib
resistant) using MTT assay. The data obtained indicated
that TQ can significantly suppress the proliferation of all
MM cell types examined in a dose- and time-dependent
manner (Fig. 1B). We next investigated the effect of TQ
on the proliferation of CD138+ cells from 5 patients with
MM. The cells were exposed to different concentrations of
TQ and then examined for cell proliferation by the MTT
method. As shown in Fig. 1C, exposure of CD138+ cells
from all 5 MM patients to TQ decreased cell proliferation
in a dose-dependent manner.

in the accumulation of cell population in the sub-G1 phase
as compared to U266 cells treated with TQ or bortezomib
alone (Fig. 2A). To further confirm this observation,
we used annexin V staining assay, which detects an
early stage of apoptosis. The findings of this assay also
indicated an enhancement in the apoptotic effects of
bortezomib by TQ (Fig. 2B). Cleavage of procaspase-3 to
caspase-3 and caspase-3–mediated cleavage of PARP are
major characteristic features of apoptosis. In U266 cells
treated with a combination of TQ and bortezomib, there
was a substantial activation of the effector molecule procaspase-3, with a concomitant increase in cleaved form
of caspase-3 (Fig. 2C). Moreover, activation of caspase-3
led to the cleavage of a 118 kDa Poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) protein into an 85 kDa fragment (Fig.
2D). These results clearly suggested that TQ can augment
the apoptotic effect of bortezomib through the activation
of caspase-3 in MM cells.
We also analyzed whether TQ can enhance the
apoptotic effect of bortezomib in three other MM cell
lines namely, H929, KMS-11 and RPIMI 8226. We found
that treatment with TQ in combination with bortezomib
substantially increased the PARP cleavage in these
three cell lines (Figs 3A-C). We also found that TQ in
combination with bortezomib caused significant increase

TQ potentiates the apoptotic effect of bortezomib
in MM cells
Bortezomib, an inhibitor of proteasome have been
approved for the treatment of patients with MM [15].
We examined whether TQ can potentiate the apoptotic
effect of bortezomib in U266 cells. For this, U266 cells
were treated with TQ (5 μM), bortezomib (20 nM) and
a combination of both, and then examined for apoptosis
using cell cycle analysis and annexin V staining by flow
cytometry. We found that treatment with a combination of
TQ and bortezomib caused statistically significant increase

TQ suppresses MM cell migration and invasion

TQ downregulates the expression of CXCR4,
COX-2 and MMP-9 proteins in MM cells

The effect of TQ on migration and invasion of U266
cells was also investigated. The addition of TQ to the
media with U266 cells in the top chambers of transwell
inserts significantly reduced the migration of the cells
into the bottom chamber containing CXCL12, a potent
lymphocyte chemotactic factor (Fig. 4A). Using an in vitro
invasion assay, we also found that CXCL12 significantly
induced the invasion of U266 cells across the matrigel
coated polycarbonate membrane and that treatment with
TQ significantly abrogated the invasive activity (Fig. 4B).

Treatment of U266 cells with TQ was found to
downregulate the expression of the chemokine receptor
CXCR4, which is specific for CXCL12, the mediator of
inflammation, COX-2 and key matrix metalloproteinase
MMP-9, which is involved in breakdown of cellular matrix
and initiation on invasion. Their expression decreased in
a time-dependent manner, with maximum suppression
observed at around 48 h (Fig. 4C). The downmodulation in
the expression of these proteins may account for observed
anti-migratory and anti-invasive potential of TQ.

Fig 4: TQ inhibits migration and invasion of MM cell
lines. A, U266 cells (50x104/well) were plated in 0.3 ml cell

culture media with and without 15 μM TQ in the top chambers
of 24-well transwell inserts with 8-mm pores. Cell culture
medium (600 μl) containing the recombinant human B-cell
chemoattractant, CXCL12 (SDF-1α) was added to the bottom
chamber and incubated for 12 hours. After incubation, the insert
was removed and calcein-AM (5 μM) was added to the wells
and fluorescence was measured. Columns, mean; bars, SD. *,
p < 0.05. B, U266 cells (50 x104) in suspension were starved
in serum-free RPMI-1640 for 3 h, and then loaded onto the
Matrigel-coated inserts in the upper chambers of tissue culture
inserts placed in 24 well plates. The wells of the plate were filled
with 600-μl of 10% FBS-containing cell culture media with 100
ng/ml CXCL12 (SDF-1α). TQ (15 μM) was added with the cells
to the upper chamber. Plates were then incubated at 37°C for
12 h. At the end of the incubation period, calcein-AM (5 μM)
was added to the wells containing invasive cells, incubated
at 37°C for 1 hour and fluorescence was measured. Columns,
mean; bars, SD. *, p < 0.05. C, U266 cells were treated with
TQ (15 μM) for 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h at 37°C. Whole-cell
extracts were prepared, separated on SDS-PAGE, and subjected
to Western blot analysis using antibody against CXCR4, COX-2
and MMP-9. The same blots were stripped and reprobed with
β-actin antibody to show equal protein loading.

of

day 30, the average tumor volumes of the bortezomibalone and the TQ alone treated group were 58% and 47%
less than that of the untreated control, respectively. The
average tumor volume in bortezomib + TQ -treated group
was significantly less (60% at day 15 and 72% at day 30)
than in the untreated group (P<0.05) and the bortezomib
alone treated group (P<0.05), from day 15 through day 30.
Overall, these findings indicated that the combination of
bortezomib and TQ was significantly effective in reducing
the tumor burden in treated mice (Figs. 5B-D).

We next examined the therapeutic potential of
TQ and bortezomib either alone or in combination on
the growth of subcutaneously implanted U266 cells in
nude mice. The detailed procedures used to establish
the U266 model in the athymic nude mice and to treat
the mice with TQ, bortezomib, and the combination of
TQ and bortezomib is depicted in Fig. 5A. The average
tumor volume in bortezomib alone and TQ alone treated
groups was significantly smaller than untreated animals
(49% and 45%, respectively) as soon as day 15, while at

TQ inhibits NF-κB DNA binding activity and
the constitutive NF-κB expression in MM tumor
tissues

from MM tissues. Our results clearly showed that the
phosphorylation of NF-κB (p65) subunit was substantially
reduced in extracts from tumor samples of mice treated
with a combination of TQ and bortezomib (Fig. 6B).

The pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB
plays a pivotal role in the proliferation and survival of
various kinds of B-cell tumors, including MM [19, 20];
therefore, the levels of constitutive NF-κB activation in
MM tumor tissues was next examined by ELISA-based
TransAM NF-κB assay kit. The DNA-binding assay for
NF-κB in nuclear extracts from tumor samples showed
that TQ in combination with bortezomib significantly
suppressed NF-κB activation, while TQ alone and
bortezomib alone had much lesser inhibition on NF-κB
than the drug combination (Fig. 6A). We also evaluated the
effect of TQ and bortezomib on NF-κB (p65) activation
by western blot analysis of whole cell extract obtained

TQ inhibits NF-κB (p65) and Ki-67 expression in
MM tumor tissues
NF-κB is known to regulate the expression of
numerous genes involved in MM pathogenesis, including
growth, survival, immortalization, angiogenesis and
metastasis [20, 21], while the nuclear protein Ki-67 is a
proliferation index, as it is expressed only by dividing
cells. The nuclear localization of p65 and the expression
of Ki-67 was examined using an immunohistochemical
method described previously [22]. Whether TQ and
bortezomib can modulate these markers in MM tumor

tissues was examined. We found that both agents
significantly reduced the p65 expression as compared
with control group individually and the combination was
most effective (p < 0.05 when compared with TQ alone;
Fig. 6C). Fig. 6D shows that both TQ (p < 0.05) and
bortezomib (p < 0.05) alone significantly downregulated
the expression of Ki-67 in MM tumor tissues and the
combination of the two was even more effective (p <
0.05).

The Bcl-2 protein, regulated by NF-κB is also highly
expressed in myeloma patients and in vitro studies have
shown its role in the regulation of chemosensitivity [23,
24]. As shown in Fig. 7B, the expression of Bcl-2 in MM
tumor tissue was significantly downregulated in mice
treated with either TQ or bortezomib alone. However, the
downregulation was more substantial in mice treated with
a combination of TQ and bortezomib. Next, to determine
whether TQ decreases MM tumor growth by inducing
apoptosis, we examined the caspase-3-positive cells in
tumors obtained from mice. Our results showed that TQ
alone and bortezomib alone caused a similar level of
increase in caspase-3 expression. Interestingly, we found
that the TQ + bortezomib combination was substantially
more effective in inducing caspase-3 activation rather than
either agent used alone (Fig. 7C; p< 0.05 versus vehicle
and TQ alone).

TQ inhibits expression of VEGF and Bcl-2 in
tumor tissues
VEGF, another protein regulated by NF-κB plays an
important role in angiogenesis and growth of MM cells, so
we next examined its expression in MM tumor samples.
Our results showed that TQ alone and bortezomib alone
significantly decreased the expression of VEGF in tumor
tissue (Fig. 7A). However, TQ + bortezomib combination
was more effective in reducing VEGF expression than
either agent used alone (p < 0.05 versus TQ alone).

TQ reduces serum levels of IL-6 and TNF- α in
MM tumor bearing mice
The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α,
are considered as major biomarkers of inflammation.
Hence, we also analyzed the effect of TQ and bortezomib
on the levels of these two cytokines in serum samples
obtained from mice. MM tumor-bearing mice treated
with TQ and bortezomib alone or in combination were
sacrificed at the end of each treatment protocol. Blood
was collected via cardiac puncture and serum separated
and used to evaluate the levels of IL-6 and TNF-α using
an ELISA kit. Interestingly, levels of both IL-6 and TNF-α
level was found to be substantially higher in untreated
tumor bearing mice. TQ and bortezomib alone treatment
significantly decreased serum IL-6 when compared to
control, while the TQ + bortezomib treated mice had 77%
reduction in serum IL-6 compared to untreated control (p
< 0.05) (Fig.8A). Similarly serum levels of TNF-α was
significantly reduced in mice treated with a combination
of TQ and bortezomib (61%, p < 0.05 versus untreated
control) (Fig.8B).

DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to determine whether
TQ could augment the apoptotic effect of bortezomib
in MM cell lines and xenograft mouse model and if so
through what mechanisms. We found that TQ inhibited the
proliferation of various MM cell lines regardless of their
sensitivity/resistance to the conventional chemotherapeutic
agents such as doxorubicin, melphalan and/or targeted
therapies such as bortezomib. TQ also inhibited the
survival of CD138+ plasma cells obtained from MM
patients in a dose dependent manner. It potentiated the
apoptotic effects of bortezomib in MM cells as evidenced
by increased accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 phase

Our results also show that enhancement of apoptotic
effects of bortezomib induced by TQ is not limited to one
MM cell line, but can be observed in several MM cell
lines. We further observed that in a xenograft mouse model
TQ alone and in combination with bortezomib effectively
suppressed the growth of subcutaneous tumor of MM
cells through the suppression of NF-κB activation. This
correlated with down-regulation of various proliferative,
anti-apoptotic, angiogenic and inflammatory biomarkers
regulated by NF-κB in MM tumor tissues.
The pathogenesis of MM involves characteristic
genetic abnormalities and the interaction between
the clonal plasma cells and the bone marrow
microenvironment [25]. Unlike other hematological
malignancies and similar to solid tumors, the genetic
abnormalities of MM are heterogeneous and the
transformation is not driven by a single gene mutation.
Thus developed MM, through complex genetic and
epigenetic events further progresses and is no longer
dependent on bone marrow microenvironment for survival
leading to extramedullary MM. Adhesion of MM cells to
the stromal cells induces the latter to secrete IL-6. IL-6
is the main growth factor for the MM cells. In turn IL-6
then induces janus kinase (JAK) / signal transducer
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), PI3K/Akt and
mitogen-activated protein kinase survival pathways in
MM cells [20, 26]. We had previously reported that TQ
can indeed inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in
MM cells through the suppression of signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation pathway
[12]. However, the effect of TQ on drug resistant MM
cell lines, patient samples and xenograft mouse model
was not investigated in that report. Moreover, we have
also reported NF-κB inhibitory potential of TQ in diverse
tumor cell lines previously [17], which may account for its
observed anti-proliferative/apoptotic effects as observed in
the present study.
CXCL12 is a member of CXC family of cytokines
and its cognate receptor is CXCR4. It has been implicated
in progression, migration, invasion and metastasis of
various cancers [27]. BMSCs secrete this chemokine,
with the MM cells from the patient sample and MM
derived cell lines expressing the cognate receptors [28].
This chemokine mediates the secretion of IL-6 and
VEGF and induces proliferation, migration and inhibits
dexamethasone induced cell death [29]. Accordingly,
CXCL12 induces invasion and CXCR4 antagonists
can negatively regulate CXCL12-induced invasion.
We noted that TQ can significantly inhibit CXCL12
induced chemotactic movement as well as invasive
potential in MM cell lines which may be mediated by the
downregulation of CXCR4 expression as observed by
western blot analysis.
MMPs belong to a family of proteases, capable of
degrading all kinds of extracellular matrix proteins [30].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Culture supernatants of bone marrow derived stromal cells
from MM patients have been found to have higher levels
of MMP than control samples [31]. Moreover, endothelial
cells can secrete hepatocyte growth factor, which then acts
on MM cells to stimulate the secretion of MMP-9 [32].
Adequate inhibition of various MMPs by a broad spectrum
MMP inhibitor SC-964 can suppress angiogenesis,
reduces tumor load and osteolytic lesions [33]. Our study
showed that TQ could substantially inhibit the expression
of MMP-9 in MM cell lines, which may account for its
observed anti-migratory/anti-invasive effects in MM cells.
In the present study, we also investigated for the first
time the potential effect of TQ alone or in combination
with bortezomib on MM growth in a xenograft mouse
model. We found that the intraperitoneal administration
of TQ alone could inhibit the growth of MM tumors in the
xenograft model. Bortezomib also induced a significant
inhibition of tumor growth. But when the two agents
were used in combination, they were found to be much
more effective in significantly suppressing the growth
of MM tumor. When examined for the mechanisms,
we observed that the activation of transcription factor
NF-κB was substantially attenuated by these two drugs
when used in combination. NF-κB has been casually
implicated in progression of various types of tumors
[14]. MM patient samples show a constitutive activation
of NF-κB to variable degree. 15-20% of MM samples
and 40% of the cell lines show mutations that lead to
constitutive activation of NF-κB pathway [34]. Activation
of NF-κB in MM cells induces proliferation, survival
and chemoresistance. When compared to chemosensitive
MM cell lines chemoresistant MM cells express higher
levels of NF-κB, suggesting a link between NF-κB and
development of chemoresistance [12, 35]. Moreover,
dexamethasone induced apoptosis is associated with
a decrease in the NF-κB DNA binding activity [35]. In
agreement with these previous reports, we also found that
MM tumor samples had elevated levels of basal NF-κB
expression as well as increased activation as observed by
DNA binding and western blot analysis. Previous studies
has shown that NF-κB activation was inhibited when
bortezomib was added, suggesting that bortezomib can
sensitize MM cells to alkylating agents by inhibiting NFκB activation [36]. In our study we found that bortezomib
can decrease the NF-κB activation in MM tumor samples,
but the TQ combination had a significant inhibition in NFκB activation even when compared to bortezomib alone
treatment. This may explain the chemosensitizing effects
of TQ as observed here and also reported previously [12,
17].
VEGF is an important signaling protein regulated
by NF-κB that stimulates the formation of new blood
vessels, through vasculogenesis and angiogenesis [37].
Dysregulation of VEGF has been shown to be a major
contributor to tumor angiogenesis as well, promoting
tumor growth, invasion and metastasis [38]. Significantly

elevated levels of VEGF are observed in a variety of
hematological malignancies [39, 40]. VEGF protein
was found in malignant cells from 75% of MM patients
studied [41] and increased serum levels of VEGF have
been correlated with a poor prognosis in patients with
advanced stages of MM [20, 42]. Thus the observed
significant downregulation of VEGF expressed in the
tumor tissues from mice treated with a combination of TQ
and bortezomib may contribute to the anti-tumor activity
through the inhibition of angiogenic pathways that are
essential for the tumor growth.
Overexpression of anti-apoptotic molecules of Bcl2 family has been linked to chemoresistance in MM [20,
24]. Prior studies has shown that the activation of NF-κB
can enforce the ectopic expression of Bcl-2 in MM cells
conferring resistance to dexamethasone induced apoptosis
through activation of survival pathways [43]. However TQ
in combination with bortezomib was found to suppress
the expression of Bcl-2 in MM tissues, which may also
account for its tumor inhibitory effects. This decline in
the survival signaling pathway contributed to the increased
apoptosis in the tumor tissues as evidenced by increase in
caspase-3 expression by immunohisrochemistry. IL-6, a
pleiotropic cytokine, is one of the major growth factors
in MM [44]. IL-6 induces survival of MM cell through
activation of STAT3, which upregulates anti-apoptotic
proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 and cell cycle proteins like
cyclin D1, and cyclin E [20, 24]. The fact that TQ can
abrogate IL-6 induced STAT3 activation has already been
reported by our group previously [12]. In the present
study, we noted that MM bearing mice treated with TQ
in combination with bortezomib produced a significant
inhibition in the production of IL-6, when compared to
both vehicle control and bortezomib alone treated groups,
indicating that the combination is quite effective in
blocking the IL-6 mediated growth and survival of MM.
TNF-α is another important growth factor secreted from
MM cells to act on BMSCs to stimulate the secretion
of IL-6. TNF-α induces the expression of adhesion
molecules on both MM cells and BMSCs [45]. TNF-α
have been reported to be involved in the control of VEGF
production by MM cells [46]. TNF-α also participates
in transendothelial migration of MM cells by acting
via TNF-R2 and upregulating the secretion of MCP1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) in MM cells
[47]. Interestingly, TNF-α blockers such as thalidomide
and other immunomodulatory agents have exhibited
significant anti-myeloma activity [48]. We observed that
TQ in combination with bortezomib produced significant
reduction in the serum levels of TNF-α, which can
contribute to the anti-tumor activity. Also since both these
cytokines are regulated by NF-κB, inhibitory effects of TQ
on NF-κB may explain its potential suppressive effects on
the serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-α.
TQ has been extensively studied so far in diverse
tumor models without exhibiting any significant toxic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effects to normal cells [16]. However, TQ has never been
tested in humans before either alone or in combination
with targeted therapies and hence its clinically relevant
doses are not clear as yet. Overall, the ability of TQ
to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, invasion and
potentiate the apoptotic effects of bortezomib while
suppressing NF-κB activation and its regulated gene
products, provides a sound rationale to test this agent to
enhance treatment efficacy, reduce toxicity, and overcome
chemoresistance of relapsed or refractory MM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
Thymoquinone, MTT, Tris, glycine, NaCl, SDS,
BSA and β-actin antibody were obtained from SigmaAldrich (Missouri, USA). TQ was dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) as a 50 mM stock solution and stored
at −20°C for the experiments. Further dilution was done in
cell culture medium, so that the final DMSO concentration
was less than 0.1%. RPMI 1640, 0.4% trypan blue vital
stain and antibiotic-antimycotic mixture were obtained
from Invitrogen (California, USA). Fetal bovine serum
(FBS) was purchased from BioWest (Miami, FL, USA).
Antibodies to p65, COX-2, Bcl-2, Ki-67, VEGF, procaspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, PARP, MMP-9, CXCR4,
goat anti-rabbit-horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate
and goat anti-mouse HRP were obtained from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (CA, USA). ELISA kits for mouse
IL-6 and TNF-α were purchased from R&D Systems Inc
(Minneapolis, USA). Nuclear extraction and DNA binding
kits was obtained from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA).

Cell lines
Human MM cell lines U266, H929, KMS, RPMI8226, RPMI-8226-Dox-6 (doxorubicin-resistant clone),
RPMI-8226-LR-5 (a melphalan-resistant clone) were

Western blot analysis

The anti-proliferative effect of TQ against various
MM cell lines and patient samples was determined by the
MTT dye uptake method. Primary MM patient cells were
obtained from bone marrow aspirates of patients after
informed consent and with ethical approval from the NUS
IRB. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated
with RBC lysis buffer and subsequently CD138+ plasma
cells were isolated using magnetic cell sorting with CD138
easysep magnetic nanoparticles (Stemcells Technologies,
Singapore) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Purified CD138+ patient cells were grown in IMDM,
Glutamax (Gibco, Invitrogen), supplemented with 20%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin and
100 µg/mL streptomycin, 10ng/mL of IL-6 (Militenyi
Biotech,Surrey UK) and 100ng/mL of rhIGF-1(R&D
Systems, Oxford, UK). All cells were grown at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Briefly, the cells (5
× 103/well) were incubated in triplicate in a 96-well plate
in the presence or absence of indicated concentrations of
TQ in a final volume of 0.2 ml for different time intervals
at 37 °C. Thereafter, 20 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in
PBS) was added to each well. After a 4-h incubation in
the dark at 37 °C, 0.1 ml of lysis buffer (20% SDS, 50%
dimethylformamide) was added and incubated for 2 h at
37 °C, followed by measurement of optical density at 570
nm by Tecan plate reader (Durham, NC).

For detection of proteins, TQ-treated cells were
harvested and lysed in whole cell lysis buffer (20 mM
Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0),
0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.005 mg/ml
leupeptin, 0.4 mM PMSF, and 4 mM NaVO4). Lysates
were then spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to remove
insoluble material and stored at −80°C for later use.
The protein content in the lysates was measured by BioRad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate (Bio-Rad,
CA) and equal quantity of protein was resolved on a
10% SDS gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were
electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked
with 5% nonfat milk, and probed with appropriate
antibody overnight at 4°C. The blot was washed,
exposed to HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1
h, and finally examined by chemiluminescence (ECL; GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Migration assay
U266 cells (50x104/well) were plated in 0.3 ml
cell culture media with and without 15 μM TQ in the top
chambers of 24-well transwell inserts with 8-μm pores.
Cell culture medium (600 μl) containing the Recombinant
Human B-cell chemoattractant, CXCL12 (SDF-1α) (100
ng/ml; Prospec, Ness-Ziona, Israel) was added to the
bottom chamber and incubated for 12 h. After incubation,
the insert was removed and calcein-AM (5 μM) was added
to the wells. The cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour to
allow the cells to internalize calcein-AM. The fluorescence
was measured (485 nm excitation, 520 nm emission). A
standard curve was generated with cells ranging from
50000-1000 cells using calcein-AM under same condition
and cells number calculated from relative fluorescence of
treated samples.

Flow cytometric analysis
To determine whether TQ can potentiate the
apoptotic effect of bortezomib, MM cells were first
synchronized by serum starvation and then exposed to
TQ (5 μM), bortezomib (20 nM) and a combination
of both for 24 h. Thereafter cells were washed, fixed
with 70% ethanol, and incubated for 30 min at 37°C
with 0.1% RNase A in PBS. Cells were washed again,
resuspended, and stained with PBS containing 25 μg/mL
propidium iodide (PI) for 30 min at room temperature.
Cell distribution across the cell cycle was analyzed with a
CyAn ADP flow cytometer (Dako Cytomation).

Invasion assay
An invasion assay was performed with U266 cells in
24-well plates with polycarbonate membranes (ThinCert
8-μm pore size tissue culture insert, Greiner Bio-one, NC,
USA). Briefly the upper chambers were coated with 50μl Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA, USA) in
advance according to the directions of the manufacturer.
U266 cells (50 x104) in suspension were starved in
serum-free RPMI-1640 for 3 h, and then loaded onto
the Matrigel-coated inserts in the upper chambers. The
wells of the plate were filled with 600-μl of 10% FBScontaining cell culture media with 100 ng/ml CXCL12
(SDF-1α) (Prospec, Ness-Ziona, Israel). TQ (15μM)
was added with the cells to the upper chamber. Plates
were then incubated at 37°C for 12 h. At the end of the

Annexin V assay
The procedure of annexin V-PI staining was carried
out according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen).
U266 cells (5× 105/mL) were treated with TQ (5 μM),
bortezomib (20 nM) and a combination of both for 24
h. After the incubation, the cells were washed with PBS,
and resuspended in FITC-conjugated annexin V and PIcontaining binding buffer for 15 min in dark. Samples
were then analyzed immediately by flow cytometer.

(25 μL) was added, vortexed and the centrifuged for 30
seconds at 14,000 x g in a microcentrifuge pre-cooled at
4°C. The resulting nuclear pellet was suspended in 50 μL
complete lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 30 min with
intermittent mixing. The suspension was then centrifuged
at 14,000 × g at 4°C for 30 min. The supernatant (nuclear
extract) was collected and stored at −70°C until use.

Xenograft tumor model

NF-κB DNA-binding assay

All the procedures involving animals were reviewed
and approved by National University of Singapore
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Fiveweek-old athymic nu/nu male Balb/c mice (Biological
Resource Centre, Biopolis, Singapore) were implanted
subcutaneously in the right flank with U266 cells (2 × 106
cells/100 μL of PBS/Matrigel). When tumors have reached
0.25 cm in diameter, the mice were randomized into the
following treatment groups (n = 6/group): (i) untreated
control (DMSO (0.1%; v/v), 100 μL intraperitoneally);
(ii) bortezomib (0.25 mg/kg of body weight, suspended in
DMSO (0.1%; v/v), intraperitoneally, weekly once; (iii)
TQ (1 mg/kg of body weight, suspended in DMSO (0.1%;
v/v), intraperitoneally, daily); and (iv) TQ (1 mg/kg of
body weight, daily) + bortezomib (0.25 mg/kg of body
weight weekly once), intraperitoneally. The treatment
was continued for 4 weeks, and then the mice were
maintained without any drug for 5 more days. The body
weights and tumor sizes were recorded every five days,
and the tumor size was determined by a Vernier caliper
measurement. The animals were euthanized at the end of
the therapy and blood collected by heart puncture. Primary
tumors were excised and the final tumor volume was
measured as V= 4/3πr3, where r is the mean radius of the
3 dimensions (length, width, and depth). Half of the tumor
tissue was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for
immunohistochemistry and routine hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) staining. A small portion of tumor (75-100 mg/
mouse) was used for nuclear extraction. The remaining
tumor tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at -80°C.

To determine NF-κB activation in MM tumor
samples, we conducted DNA-binding assay using
TransAM NF-κB Kit (Active Motiff), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 20 μg of nuclear
proteins were added into a 96-well plate coated with
an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the consensus
binding site for NF-κB (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′) and
incubated for 1 hour. The wells were washed and
incubated with antibodies against NF-κB p65 subunit
for 1 hour. An HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
was then applied to detect the bound primary antibody
and it provided the basis for colorimetric quantification.
The enzymatic product was measured at 450 nm with a
reference wavelength of 655 nm by microplate reader
(Tecan Systems).

Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues
Solid tumors from control and the various treated
groups were fixed with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin,
processed, and embedded in paraffin. The sections were
cut and deparafinized in xylene, dehydrated in graded
alcohol, and finally hydrated in water. Antigen retrieval
was conducted by boiling the slide in 10 mmol/L sodium
citrate (pH 6.0) for 30 min. Immunohistochemistry was
conducted following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Dako LSAB Kit). Briefly, endogenous peroxidases
were quenched with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Nonspecific
binding was blocked by incubation in the blocking
reagent in the LSAB Kit (Dako) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were incubated
overnight with primary antibodies as follows: anti-p65,
anti-Ki-67, anti-VEGF, anti-Bcl-2 and anti-caspase3
(each at 1:100 dilutions). The slides were subsequently
washed several times in TBS with 0.1% Tween-20 and
were incubated with biotinylated linker for 30 minutes,
followed by incubation with streptavidin conjugate
provided in the LSAB Kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Immunoreactive species were detected using
3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as a substrate.
The sections were counterstained with Gill’s hematoxylin
and mounted under glass cover slips. Images were taken
using an Olympus BX51 microscope (magnification, ×20).

Preparation of nuclear extract from tumor
samples
Nuclear extract was prepared from the MM tumor
tissues using nuclear extraction kit from Active Motiff
(Carlsbad, CA), according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Tumor tissue (75-100 mg/mouse) from control and treated
mice were minced in 0.3 ml ice-cold 1X hypotonic buffer
supplemented with DTT and detergent and homogenized
using a Dounce homogenizer, and then centrifuged at 850
× g at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred
into a pre-chilled microcentrifuge tube and stored for later
