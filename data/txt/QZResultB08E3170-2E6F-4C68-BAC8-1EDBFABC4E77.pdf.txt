BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to describe the incidence, timing, and predictors of treatmentrelated mortality (TRM) among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. METHODS: Patients aged <20 years who were diagnosed with ALL between January 2000 and March 2008,
who received treatment in any of the 3 countries, and who started induction chemotherapy were included in the
study. Almost all patients were treated on the El Salvador-Guatemala-Honduras II protocol, which was based on the
St. Jude Total XIII and XV protocols. Biologic, socioeconomic, and nutritional variables were examined as predictors
of TRM. RESULTS: Of 1670 patients, TRM occurred as a first event in 156 children (9.3%); TRM occurred during remission induction therapy in 92 of 156 children (59%), between remission induction and maintenance therapy in 27 of
156 children (17%), and during maintenance therapy in 37 of 156 children (24%). Although the TRM rate decreased in
patients who were diagnosed after July 1, 2004 (11.2% vs 7.9%; P ¼ .02), the rate of induction death did not change
(5.2% vs 5.8%; P ¼ .58). Independent predictors of induction death included higher risk ALL (odds ratio [OR], 1.84;
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-3.27; P ¼ .04), lower initial platelet counts (OR per 10  109/L, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.890.98; P ¼ .005), and longer travel time to the clinic (OR, 1.06 per hour; 95% CI, 1.01-1.14; P ¼ .03). CONCLUSIONS: In
Central America, TRM remains an important cause of treatment failure in children with ALL. A large proportion of
TRM occurs in maintenance, although this proportion has decreased over time. Supportive care interventions should
especially target children who present with low platelet counts. Further study on transfusion ability and the location

KEYWORDS: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Central America, child, developing countries, treatment-related death.

The past several decades have seen significant improvements in the outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who are treated in high-income countries (HICs), in which >85% are cured.1,2 However, the majority of
children with ALL live in low-income countries (LICs), where the chance of a cure is far lower.3,4 Several causes for this
survival gap have been proposed: more advanced stage at diagnosis, differences in population biology, higher rates of
relapse, abandonment of therapy, and higher rates of death from toxicity (treatment-related mortality [TRM]).5
TRM commonly causes treatment failure in LICs. Whereas ALL in HICs has been associated with TRM rates of 1%
to 3%,6-11 the few studies that have investigated LICs have identified rates from 11% to 21%.4,12-15 In El Salvador,
12.5% of children with ALL experienced TRM.16 Although we identified several predictors of overall TRM in the El
Salvador cohort, the limited sample size precluded an analysis of the patterns and timing of TRM. A more detailed
understanding is necessary for both the design of rational interventions and the identification of high-risk groups for
which specific interventions should be developed. In the current study, we expanded our cohort to analyze children with
ALL who were diagnosed over an 8-year period in 3 Central American countries—El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras—allowing a detailed examination of the incidence, causes, timing, and predictors of TRM in this population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population and Setting
In this retrospective cohort study, the patient sample consisted of children with ALL who started induction chemotherapy in any of the following 3 centers: Benjamin
Bloom National Children’s Hospital, San Salvador, El
Salvador; the National Pediatric Oncology Unit, Guatemala City, Guatemala; or Hospital Escuela, Tegucigalpa,
Honduras. These hospitals and their associated satellites
are the sole pediatric oncology centers in their respective
countries, which allowed us to conduct population-based
analyses. We included those aged birth to 20 years at
diagnosis with de novo ALL who were diagnosed between
January 1, 2000 and March 28, 2008. Patients with
mature B-cell leukemia were excluded.
The vast majority of patients in all 3 sites were
treated according to the El Salvador-Guatemala-Honduras II protocol, which was based on the St Jude Total XIII
and XV protocols.1,17 Important modifications from the
St Jude protocols included the use of only 2 risk groups,
standard and high. Standard-risk patients were defined as
those ages 1 to 10 years at diagnosis who presented with
white blood cell (WBC) counts <50  109/L, a DNA
index between 1.16 and 1.6, and the absence of any highrisk features (central nervous system [CNS] or testicular
involvement, T-cell immunophenotype, M3 bone marrow on Day 15, or M2/M3 bone marrow on Day 36).
Etoposide was omitted from the St. Jude protocols,
and the dosing of high-dose methotrexate was modified to
a 3-hour infusion of 2 g/m2 for standard-risk patients and
3 g/m2 for high-risk patients.
Programs targeting hand washing were in place during the entire study period. Patients received cotrimoxazole for Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis; no other
prophylactic antibiotics or antifungals were used. Central
lines were not used routinely in the care of children with
ALL. All children with febrile neutropenia were admitted
to the hospital and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. All 3 centers broadened antibiotics in case of hemodynamic instability and initiated antifungal coverage in
patients with prolonged fever; the specific choice of
antibiotics and antifungals varied by center and period.
Intensive care and mechanical ventilation were available
throughout the study period in all 3 centers. Colony-stimulating factors were not used for prophylaxis or for the
treatment of febrile neutropenia.
Blood banking practices and availability of blood
products varied among centers. Both El Salvador and
Honduras had blood banks available on site, whereas the

Cancer

center in Guatemala was supported by an off-site, private
blood bank. Blood products were obtained from both
family members and random donors in all 3 sites. Hemoglobin transfusion thresholds for stable patients were
7.0 g/L in Guatemala and Honduras and 8.0 g/L in El Salvador. Platelet transfusion levels for asymptomatic
patients were 10,000  109/L in Guatemala and Honduras and 40,000  109/L in El Salvador. No systematic
data on the length of time between blood product request
and administration were available.
Allopurinol was given to all children with ALL in El
Salvador in an effort to prevent tumor lysis syndrome
(TLS); its use in the other 2 centers was restricted to those
patients who had high WBC counts, high uric acid levels,
or signs of TLS. Rasburicase and leukophoresis were not
available at any site, although hemodialysis was available
at all 3 centers.
Abandonment of therapy is an important treatment
challenge in many LICs and can represent the most common cause of treatment failure.18 In all 3 centers, social
workers attempted to contact families who missed
appointments to encourage the resumption of treatment.
This often involved visits to the patient’s community and
home. Treatment was provided at no financial cost to
families; accommodation and child care also were offered
at no cost to families living significant distances from the
treatment center. This was funded primarily through the
support of local nongovernmental organizations and
international partnerships. These efforts have reduced
abandonment rates to 13% for children in El Salvador.19
Procedure
In all 3 centers, data managers abstracted information
from patient charts in real time. Data were confirmed by
the treating oncologists and then entered in the Pediatric
Oncology Networked Database (POND) (http//:www.
pond4kids.org accessed March 15, 2011). POND is an
online database for pediatric cancer patient information
that was designed to permit users at multiple locations to
store and analyze data that include patient demographics,
diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes in a secure environment with stringent control of access and privacy.20
Audits of POND data quality in Honduras revealed that
accuracy for basic data fields was 99%.20
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was TRM, which was defined as
any induction death or any death in complete remission.
Induction death was defined as any death that occurred

4789

Original Article

within 42 days of starting induction treatment. Because
date of remission was not captured in the database, death
in complete remission was defined as any death that
occurred 42 days after diagnosis in patients who did not
relapse or have a second malignancy. These definitions are
consistent with those used by others.7,10,11
TRM was further subdivided into specific causes:
infection, bleeding, and other causes (including metabolic
derangements and organ dysfunction). An additional category of disease-related death was included for patients
who died during remission induction therapy. Cause of
death was determined by the local site. Timing of TRM
was categorized as follows: 1) induction (from Day 0 to
Day <42), 2) postinduction (from Day 42 to the beginning of maintenance therapy), and 3) after the initiation
of maintenance therapy. The study period was divided
into an early period and a late period, which we defined as
before and after July 1, 2004, respectively (the approximate midpoint of the study period).
Potential Predictors
We examined predictors of TRM during 2 phases of
therapy, during remission induction and after initiating
maintenance therapy, as the majority of deaths
occurred during these periods. Potential predictor variables were chosen based on previous literature and data
availability across the 3 sites and were categorized as
biologic, socioeconomic, or nutritional. Different sites
began to collect data on covariates at different times
during the study period, resulting in various data availability between variables. Biologic variables included
demographic features, such as age and sex, and diseaserelated features, such as risk status (standard vs high),
immunophenotype (B-cell vs T-cell), DNA index,
CNS status, and initial blood counts.
Socioeconomic variables included monthly income,
maximal parental education (secondary level or greater vs
primary level or lower), number of household family
members, and time traveling to the clinic. Monthly
incomes were measured across the 3 countries in US dollars (USD), which, in turn, were corrected for purchasing
power parity (PPP). Simple exchange rates between countries do not reflect the individual purchasing power of a
currency within a country. PPP is calculated between
countries by comparing the price of a standard ‘‘basket’’ of
goods and services. 2005 PPP conversion factors provided
by the World Bank were used: El Salvador, 0.55; Guatemala, 4.54; and Honduras, 9.66.21 Thus, 4.54 units of
the local Guatemalan currency have the same purchasing

4790

power as 9.66 units of the local Honduran currency.
Dividing these figures by the average USD-local currency
exchange rate for 2005 (1:1, 1:7.73, and 1:19.6 for El
Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, respectively), we
calculated that 0.55 USD in El Salvador had the same
purchasing power as 0.587 USD in Guatemala and 0.49
USD in Honduras. Therefore, the monthly income of
each patient in USD was multiplied by the appropriate
correction to give the monthly PPP.
Nutritional variables included body mass index percentile, triceps skin-fold thickness percentile, middleupper arm circumference percentile, and initial albumin.
Body mass index percentile was calculated relative to
growth charts published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2000.22 Triceps skin-fold thickness
provides a measure of fat mass, whereas middle-upper
arm circumference is a measure of lean mass; previously,
these have been suggested as ‘‘gold-standard’’ measures of
nutritional status in both general pediatric and oncologic
populations.23 Both were calculated with reference to previously collected population norms.24
Statistical Methods
The distribution of TRM causes by phase of therapy and
the proportion of patients experiencing TRM by early
and late periods were compared using the chi-square test
or the Fisher exact test, as appropriate. Predictors of
induction death were examined using logistic regression.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore
predictors of maintenance TRM in which relapsed and
second malignancies were considered competing events.
Variables that were significant at the P < .1 level in univariate analyses were included in multivariate models. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS-PC software
(version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Statistical significance was defined as P < .05. Because of the nature of this
study, consent from patients was not required. This study
was approved by the institutional research ethics boards at
The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada and
at each of the 3 local sites.

RESULTS
The study sample included 1792 patients who were diagnosed within the specified period. Of these patients, 122
(6.8%) did not start any chemotherapy; thus, 1670
patients with ALL were included in the analysis. Demographic characteristics of the patients are provided in

between variables.

156 (9.3%) experienced TRM. Of these 156 deaths, 92
(59%) occurred in induction (before Day 42), 27 (17%)
occurred after induction (from Day 42 to before the start
of maintenance therapy), and 37 (24%) occurred during
maintenance therapy or later.
Table 2 indicates that the distribution of subcauses
of TRM differed significantly by phase of therapy. Infection accounted for a greater proportion of TRM in maintenance therapy, whereas bleeding and other causes,
primarily metabolic, were responsible for more deaths in
the induction and postinduction periods (P ¼ .01).When
examining the proportion of patients who experienced
TRM by treatment period, the TRM rate decreased in
those who were diagnosed in the early period compared
with the late period (11.2% vs 7.9%; P ¼ .02). However,
the rate of induction death did not change between the 2
periods (5.2% vs 5.8%; P ¼ .58). Indeed, induction death
represented an increasing proportion of total TRM
between the 2 periods (46% vs 73%; P ¼ .002), whereas
the proportion of TRM that occurred in maintenance
decreased (30% vs 17%; P ¼ .002).
The median time of induction death was 17.5 days
from the start of induction therapy, with an interquartile
range (IQR) of 12 to 26 days. Thus, 75% of induction

Cancer

deaths occurred on or after Day 12 of induction therapy.
The median time of maintenance TRM was 171 days
(IQR, 78-532 days) from the start of maintenance
therapy.
The univariate analysis of predictors of induction
death is provided in Table 3. Predictors of induction
death included high-risk status (odds ratio [OR], 1.77;
95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-2.79; P ¼ .01), higher
initial WBC count (OR per 10  109/L, 1.02; 95% CI,
1.00-1.04; P ¼ .02) lower initial platelets (OR per 10 
109/L, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97; P < .0001), and longer
travel time to the clinic (OR per hour, 1.05; 95% CI,
1.01-1.11; P ¼ .02). Nutritional variables did not predict
induction death. When placed in a multivariate model
that contained these 4 variables, the initial WBC count no
longer was associated with induction death (OR per 10 
109/L, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.98-1.03; P ¼ .56). However,
high-risk status (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.03-3.27; P ¼ .04),
lower initial platelets (OR per 10  109/L, 0.94; 95% CI,
0.89-0.98; P ¼ .005), and longer travel time to the clinic
(OR per hour, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.14; P ¼ .03)
remained independently predictive of induction death.
TRM during maintenance therapy was not predicted significantly by any of the examined variables.

DISCUSSION
The current study of 1670 children with ALL in Central
America represents, to the best of our knowledge, the
largest cohort of pediatric ALL patients studied in the LIC
setting to date. We observed that TRM represented an
important cause of treatment failure in this population
and that 24% of these events occurred during maintenance therapy. Patients with high-risk status, lower initial
platelet counts, and longer travel times to the clinic were
at the greatest risk of induction death; however, we were
unable to identify a group at greater risk of TRM during
maintenance therapy. Although TRM rates decreased
over the study period, the decrease mainly reflected a

4792

decrease in maintenance TRM, and induction death rates
remained constant.
The TRM rate of 9.3% in this study was higher than
equivalent rates in HIC settings that reportedly ranged
from 1% to 3%.6-11 However, our incidence was somewhat lower than ALL TRM rates reported in other LIC
populations; studies in India, Pakistan, Brazil, and Thailand have described TRM rates between 11.5% and
16%.12-15 It is noteworthy that, in a study conducted in
Honduras of 168 children with ALL between January
1999 and January 2002, the TRM rate was 20.8%,4
which was higher than our more recent and much larger
cohort. Indeed, our results verify that TRM is decreasing
over time in Central America; 11.2% of children who
were diagnosed before July 1, 2004 experienced TRM versus 7.9% of children who were diagnosed after that date.
Improvements in supportive care and experience with the
protocol were likely responsible for the decline. Over the
study period, for example, weekly meetings conducted
online at www.cure4kids.org were initiated, during which
the supportive care of challenging individual patients was
discussed. In the HIC setting, a ‘‘learning curve’’ with intensive treatment protocols has been associated with a
reduction in TRM over time once centers gain experience
with a specific protocol. For example, in pediatric patients
with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a reduction in the
TRM rate from 19% to 12% over time was demonstrated
in the Children’s Oncology Group CCG-2961 trial,25
and a reduction from 18% to 10% was reported in the
Medical Research Council AML-10 trial.26 Such a learning curve also may explain the reduction in TRM
observed in Central America over time in the current
study.
Induction death, however, did not decline, remaining similar across the study period (5.2% vs 5.8%). This is
in contrast to recent reports from HICs.11 Over half of
these deaths were secondary to infections, with another
18.5% caused by bleeding. It is noteworthy that the

Cancer

October 15, 2011

TRM in Pediatric ALL in Central America/Gupta et al

median time to induction death was at Day 17.5, and the
majority of deaths occurred after Day 12 of therapy.
These data suggest that there is opportunity and time for
interventions to address induction deaths.
Few studies have analyzed predictors of TRM in
LICs. In HICs, age, sex, high-risk status, higher initial
WBC counts, T-cell lineage immunophenotype, and trisomy 21 have been associated with an increased risk of
TRM.7-9,11 In an Indian study, malnutrition, lymphadenopathy, and lower hemoglobin levels were associated
with TRM.13 In our previous study in El Salvador, we
observed that socioeconomic variables predicted TRM,
whereas biologic parameters did not.16
This study is the first to examine predictors of TRM
in an LIC subdivided by phase of therapy. The results
may lead to the more accurate identification of high-risk
groups, because predictors of TRM occurring during
induction therapy are likely to be different from TRM
occurring during maintenance therapy. Indeed, we
observed that children with high-risk status, lower platelet
counts, and a longer travel time to the treating center were
at greater risk of induction death. These results have several implications. First, given the risk associated with a
low initial platelet count and the finding that almost 20%
of induction deaths were secondary to bleeding, children
in this setting may benefit from more aggressive platelet
transfusion support. These data suggest that careful review
of platelet availability and assessment of outcomes using
various platelet thresholds during the induction period
may also be useful. Second, given the late median time of
induction death and the risk associated with longer travel
times, evaluation of inpatient versus outpatient location at
the time of death is warranted. If deaths are occurring as
outpatients, then consideration should be given to housing patients at a location close to the hospital for children
who live far from the hospital, similar to the system used
for children at risk of abandonment.
It is striking that approximately 25% of the TRM in
our cohort occurred during maintenance therapy, and
that most were infectious in nature. The median time of
maintenance TRM was 171 days from the start of maintenance therapy, although the IQR was between 78 days
and 532 days, indicating that these events were spread out
throughout maintenance. This contrasts sharply with the
patterns observed in HICs, where TRM in maintenance is
considered a rare event. The etiology of the different pattern observed in our study population is unclear. Differences in risk and severity of infectious events, nutrition or
immune status, or access to care during febrile episodes

Cancer

October 15, 2011

may account for the difference, although our study was
unable to demonstrate a relation between nutritional or
socioeconomic variables and a greater risk of maintenance
TRM. Although maintenance TRM did decline over the
study period, further study is needed to understand the
mechanisms behind this event to facilitate further
decreases. One way to gain more insight into the causes of
TRM would be to carefully examine episodes of febrile
neutropenia and determine whether there are barriers and
delays to the administration of empiric antibiotic therapy.
The role of socioeconomic status (SES) in LIC pediatric oncology has yet to be fully elucidated. Measures of
SES have been linked to outcome in ALL in several LICs,
both for settings in which the cost of treatment was borne
by families and for settings in which treatment was
free.3,27,28 Work limited to El Salvador indicated that
income predicted the risk of TRM, abandonment overall,
and event-free survival in children with standard-risk
ALL, although not in high-risk children.16,19,29 In the
current study, however, which included the center in El
Salvador and also the centers in Guatemala and Honduras, income did not predict induction death or maintenance TRM. The only socioeconomic variable that was
predictive was travel time to the clinic. The reason for the
different effect of SES in the 2 studies is unknown. The
lack of data on parental education and income for a large
number of patients may have weakened our ability to
examine the effect of SES. However, it is also possible that
the impact of SES differs in these 3 countries, thus
explaining the negative association between SES and
TRM in the combined analysis.
Strengths of our study include its population-based
approach and the size of the cohort, which allowed for a
more detailed look at TRM in this setting. However, several limitations deserve mention. First, our study did not
include children who died in hospital before chemotherapy was initiated or those who died before reaching the
hospital. Second, our definition of TRM was similar to
that used by some, but not all, cooperative groups.7,10,11
The Nordic and Dutch groups, for example, in their definition of induction death, do not include children who
die after achieving remission.8,9 Thus, comparing our
results with the results reported by these groups is problematic. Indeed, standard international definitions of
TRM in acute leukemia are needed.
Another limitation of our study is that POND did
not contain detailed information on the cause of infectious TRM. In part, the lack of this information is related
to limited availability of diagnostic capabilities in

4793

Original Article

individual centers, including the absence of blood culture media during some periods in some centers.
Although the availability of diagnostic testing for bacteria, viruses, and fungi varied across centers and through
time within each center, an important future goal is to
examine the etiology of infectious mortality such that
interventional trials may be planned. This may be especially helpful in understanding deaths that occur during maintenance therapy. For example, a clinical
diagnosis of pneumonia as the cause of death is not
sufficient to develop prevention strategies, because the
optimal strategy would differ if pneumonias were predominantly bacterial versus secondary to Pneumocystis
jiroveci. Finally, just as our study indicates that TRM
in Central America follows a markedly different pattern
than in HICs, caution should be exercised when generalizing our results to other low-income settings, in
which different conditions may apply. Our current
data demonstrates that the collection of local data is
critical to designing the most appropriate interventions.
Future work should focus on identifying interventions that can improve outcomes in these settings. Interventions to consider include a focus on platelet
transfusion support, housing during induction therapy,
and support around febrile neutropenia. However, further
research carefully delineating platelet product availability,
location of induction death, time to empiric antibiotics in
febrile neutropenia, and the microbiology of infectious
TRM are prerequisites to designing rational interventional trials.
