Abstract
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor has been reported to
suppress tumor progression. However, it is unclear whether
this inhibitor can also prevent lymphatic metastasis. To
determine the effects of COX-2 inhibitor on lymphatic
metastasis, etodolac, a COX-2 inhibitor, was given p.o. to mice
bearing orthotopic xenografts or with carcinomatous peritonitis induced with a highly metastatic human diffuse-type
gastric carcinoma cell line, OCUM-2MLN. Tumor lymphangiogenesis was significantly decreased in etodolac-treated mice
compared with control mice. Consistent with this decrease in
lymphangiogenesis, the total weight of metastatic lymph
nodes was less in etodolac-treated mice than in control mice.
Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the major source
of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) and VEGF-D
was F4/80-positive macrophages in our models. The mRNA
levels of VEGF-C in mouse macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells, as
well as those in tumor tissues, were suppressed by etodolac.
The growth of human dermal lymphatic microvascular
endothelial cells was also suppressed by etodolac. Supporting
these findings, etodolac also inhibited lymphangiogenesis in
a model of chronic aseptic peritonitis, suggesting that COX-2
can enhance lymphangiogenesis in the absence of cancer
cells. Our findings suggest that COX-2 inhibitor may be useful
for prophylaxis of lymph node metastasis by reducing
macrophage-mediated tumor lymphangiogenesis. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Lymph node metastasis is a common occurrence in cancer, and
lymphatic vessels serve as an important route for the spread of
cancer cells (1, 2). Lymphatic metastasis was previously believed
to be a passive process in which detached cancer cells reach
lymph nodes through preexisting local lymphatic vessels (3).
However, recent studies have suggested that lymphangiogenesis
actively contributes to metastasis based on the observations that
lymphatic vessel density is correlated with the extent of lymph
node metastasis and/or unfavorable prognosis of certain cancers
(2, 4, 5). Moreover, some animal tumor models have revealed that

expression of lymphangiogenic growth factors leads to formation
of lymphatic vessels and that lymphangiogenesis is accompanied
by enhanced lymphatic metastasis (2). These findings strongly
suggest that lymphatic metastasis can be blocked by inhibition of
tumor lymphangiogenesis (1, 6, 7).
The best studied lymphangiogenic signaling system is the
vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C)/VEGF-D and VEGF
receptor 3 (VEGF-R3) signaling axis, which has been shown to play
a central role in lymphangiogenesis in animal models (1, 2, 4).
Elevated expression of VEGF-C or VEGF-D has been observed in
many human cancers (2, 4). A number of studies have shown that
levels of expression of VEGF-C in primary tumor correlate with
lymphatic vessel invasion and/or lymph node metastasis (2, 4, 8),
although the correlation between VEGF-D and metastasis is
currently unclear (4, 9). These ligands are thought to be secreted
from tumor cells; in addition, macrophages in the peritumoral
stroma (i.e., tumor-associated macrophages) have also been
reported to produce VEGF-C and VEGF-D in certain cancers and
to induce lymphangiogenesis (10). The contribution of inflammatory cells to lymphangiogenesis has also been shown in mouse
models of inflammation (11, 12).
Epidemiologic studies have shown that regular intake of
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), prototypic inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX), such as aspirin, can reduce the risk
of development of some cancers (13). In addition, overexpression of
COX-2, which is induced by both inflammatory and mitogenic
stimuli, is commonly found in many cancers (14–16), suggesting
that COX-2 contributes to the process of carcinogenesis. Direct
molecular evidence that COX-2 contributes to carcinogenesis has
been obtained from studies in animals engineered to be deficient in
expression of the COX-2 gene (17) or treated with COX-2 selective
inhibitors (18). Thus far, several mechanisms by which COX-2
contributes to progression of cancer have been reported, including
stimulation of proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis of cancer
cells, stimulation of cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis, and
suppression of immune responses (14, 19).
The major role of COX-2 in angiogenesis is thought to be
induction of the synthesis of prostanoids, which then stimulate the
secretion of proangiogenic factors, including VEGF-A and fibroblast growth factor-2, from cancer cells and/or stromal fibroblasts
(20, 21). In addition, COX-2 stimulates the proliferation (22),
migration, and tube formation of vascular endothelial cells (20).
Several clinical studies have indeed shown a correlation between
level of COX-2 expression and extent of angiogenesis in cancer (23).
In contrast to the effect of COX-2 on angiogenesis, that on
lymphangiogenesis remains poorly understood, although correlations between COX-2 expression and lymphangiogenesis or lymph
node metastasis have been reported for several human cancers

(24–28). To examine whether COX-2 is involved in lymphatic
metastasis, we evaluated the effects of treatment with a COX-2
selective inhibitor, etodolac (29, 30), on tumor lymphangiogenesis
and extent of lymph node metastasis using a highly metastatic
human diffuse-type gastric carcinoma cell line, OCUM-2MLN (31).
We also examined the effects of etodolac on lymphangiogenesis in
two other animal models, i.e., a model of carcinomatous peritonitis
and one of chronic aseptic peritonitis. Our findings suggest that
etodolac has antilymphangiogenic activity in vivo and that
inhibition of COX-2 could suppress tumor lymphangiogenesis and
lymph node metastasis.

Materials and Methods
Animals and cells. Immunodeficient BALB/c nu/nu mice at 4 to
5 weeks of age, obtained from Charles River Laboratories, were used for the
model of lymph node metastasis and a model of carcinomatous peritonitis.
Specific pathogen-free BALB/c mice at 4 to 5 weeks of age, obtained from
Sankyo Laboratory, were used for a model of chronic aseptic peritonitis.
Mice were treated in accordance with the policies of the Animal Ethics
Committee of the University of Tokyo. OCUM-2MLN, a human diffuse-type
gastric carcinoma cell line with a high rate of metastasis to lymph nodes,
was previously established (31). RAW264.7, a mouse macrophage-like cell
line, was a kind gift from Dr. Tadashi Muroi (NIH Sciences). Human dermal
lymphatic microvascular endothelial cells (HDLEC) were obtained from
Cambrex.
Model of lymph node metastasis. We used a lentiviral vector (a kind
gift from Dr. Hiroyuki Miyoshi, RIKEN; ref. 32) to express the green
fluorescent protein (GFP) gene stably in OCUM-2MLN. A total of 5  106
cells in 50 AL of PBS were subserosally inoculated into the gastric walls of
BALB/c nu/nu mice as previously described (31) under deep inhalation
anesthesia with ether. Four weeks after inoculation, the mice were
sacrificed for evaluation. Etodolac (500 ppm in food; obtained from Nippon
Shinyaku) or vehicle control was given p.o. throughout the experimental
period from the inoculation of cancer cells until evaluation (n = 7 mice for
each group). The experiment was repeated thrice.
Spread of cancer cells from the site of inoculation in the stomach was
observed with a VB-G25 fluorescence stereomicroscope (Keyence). The
captured fluorescence images and bright-field images were merged using
Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems). All GFP-positive, i.e.,
metastatic, lymph nodes were collected, and the total weight of these
lymph nodes was measured. Stomachs were excised, fixed for 1 h in 10%
neutral buffered formalin at room temperature, washed overnight in PBS
containing 10% sucrose at 4jC, embedded in optimal cutting temperature
compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek), and snapped frozen in dry-iced
acetone for immunohistochemical examination.
To visualize the lymphatic vessels in normal gastric wall, we injected
India ink into the gastric wall of anesthetized control mice and immediately
observed the draining lymphatic vessels by stereomicroscope.
Model of carcinomatous peritonitis. We i.p. injected OCUM-2MLN
cells (5  106) into BALB/c nu/nu mice to induce carcinomatous peritonitis.
The mice were sacrificed 2 weeks after inoculation and were evaluated.
Etodolac (500 ppm in food) or vehicle control was given p.o. throughout the
experimental period from injection of cancer cells until evaluation (n = 5 for
each group). Diaphragms with disseminated tumor cells were excised,
carefully extended, fixed for 30 min in 10% neutral buffered formalin at
room temperature, and washed overnight in PBS containing 10% sucrose at
4jC. These diaphragms were embedded in optimal cutting temperature
compound and snapped frozen in dry-iced acetone for immunohistochemical study or whole-mount immunostained. The experiment was repeated
twice.
To visualize the lymphatic vessels in normal diaphragm, we i.p. injected
India ink to control mice and observed the lymphatic vessels filled with ink
in the diaphragms 20 min later.
Model of chronic aseptic peritonitis. We i.p. injected 2 mL of 3%
thioglycollate medium (BBL thioglycollate medium, BD Biosciences) into

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

BALB/c mice thrice a week for 2 weeks to induce peritonitis. Etodolac
(500 ppm in food) or vehicle control was given p.o. during the same period
(n = 5 for each group). The mice were then sacrificed, and their diaphragms
excised and prepared for H&E staining and immunostaining as described
above. The experiment was repeated twice.
Immunohistochemistry. Whole mounts of diaphragms and 20-Am
cryostat sections of postfixed frozen samples were stained with one or
more primary antibodies. We used the following antibodies for immunostaining. For staining of lymphatic vessels, rabbit polyclonal antibody to
LYVE-1 (1:200 dilution; Abcam), rat monoclonal antibody to mouse LYVE-1
(1:100 dilution; a kind gift from Drs. Yuichi Oike and Toshio Suda, Keio
University), or rabbit polyclonal antibody to Prox1 (1:200 dilution;
Chemicon) was used. Rat monoclonal antibody to mouse platelet/
endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1; 1:200 dilution; BD
PharMingen) was used for staining of blood vessels. For staining of
VEGF-C and VEGF-D, goat polyclonal antibody to VEGF-C (C-20; 1:50
dilution, Santa Cruz Technology), and rabbit polyclonal antibody to VEGFD (H-144; 1:50 dilution, Santa Cruz Technology) were used, respectively.
Macrophages were immunostained with rat monoclonal antibody to
F4/80 (1:20 dilution; Serotec) or rat monoclonal antibody to mouse
CD11b (1:200 dilution; Chemicon). Dividing cells were stained with rabbit
polyclonal antibody to Ki-67 (1:1,000 dilution; Novo Castra). COX-2 was
stained with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to COX-2 (1:100
dilution; Cayman Chemical). Subsequently, specimens were incubated with
corresponding secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa Fluors 488, 594, or
647 (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) at 1:200 dilution. Cell nuclei were
counterstained with 20 Amol/L TOTO-3 (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes). In
control experiments, the primary antibody was omitted. Specimens were
examined with a LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) or a
fluorescence stereomicroscope.
Morphometric analysis. In the model of lymph node metastasis, we
double-stained tumor sections for LYVE-1 and PECAM-1 to examine
lymphatic and blood vessel densities. For each tumor section, five hotspots
(i.e., fields with the highest vascular density) in tumor areas were evaluated
at magnification of 200. Digital images of LYVE-1–positive lymphatic
vessels and highly PECAM-1–positive blood vessels were captured. Area
densities (percentage of total tissue area) of lymphatic vessels or blood
vessels were then calculated using ImageJ software (NIH).
In the model of carcinomatous peritonitis, whole-mount diaphragms
stained for LYVE-1 were evaluated from the pleural side. Lymphatic sprouts,
defined as tapered projections, were counted at magnification of 100 in 10
microscopic fields per diaphragm.
In the model of chronic aseptic peritonitis, whole-mount diaphragms
stained for LYVE-1 and CD11b were evaluated from the peritoneal side.
Inflammatory plaques, defined as accumulations of inflammatory cells,
especially of macrophages, had formed on the peritoneal surface of the
diaphragm. For each diaphragm, 10 microscopic fields in inflammatory
plaques were evaluated at magnification of 200. Digital images of LYVE-1–
positive lymphatic vessels were captured, and the area density of lymphatic
vessel was calculated using ImageJ software.
RNA isolation and quantitative reverse transcription–PCR. Gastric
walls with or without tumor were excised from mice, immersed in RNAlater
(Qiagen), embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound, and
snapped frozen. Total RNAs were extracted from tissue sections using the
RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen). Total RNAs from RAW264.7 and HDLECs were
extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNAs were
synthesized using the Quantitect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) with
random hexamer primers. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription–PCR
(RT-PCR) analysis was done using the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system
(Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences used are given in Supplementary Table S1.
Cell growth assay. Cell growth was determined with a WST-8 assay kit
(Nacalai Tesque). Briefly, HDLECs (1  103 cells per well) or OCUM-2MLN
(7.5  102 cells per well) in 96-well plates were incubated overnight.
Thereafter, the medium was replaced with a new medium containing
etodolac and/or lipopolysaccharide (LPS; O111:B4; Sigma-Aldrich). After
24 to 96 h of incubation, the WST-8 reagent was added to the culture. After

2 h of incubation, absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a microplate
reader (Bio-Rad).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was carried out using Excel
software (Microsoft). Results were compared by Student’s t test and
expressed as mean values with SE. Differences were considered statistically
significant at P < 0.05. All statistical tests were two-sided. Effects of etodolac
on the growth of OCUM-2MLN were evaluated by multivariate ANOVA
testing using JMP software (SAS Institute).

Results
Spread of cancer cells via lymphatic vessels in a murine
model of lymph node metastasis of gastric cancer. To
determine lymph node metastasis in vivo, we used an animal
model of human metastatic gastric carcinoma, in which OCUM2MLN cells expressing GFP were inoculated orthotopically into the
gastric wall of BALB/c nu/nu mice. Examination by fluorescence
stereomicroscope 4 weeks after inoculation revealed that the
cancer cells had metastasized from the site of inoculation into the
regional lymph nodes. Using this model, we examined tumor

lymphangiogenesis and spread of cancer cells through the
lymphatic vessels. The cancer cells in this model exhibited invasion
into peritumoral lymphatic vessels and spread along lymphatic
vessels in the gastric wall toward the regional lymph nodes
(Fig. 1A). Visualization by intravital injection of India ink into the
gastric wall of control mice (Supplementary Fig. S1) revealed that
the sizes and numbers of the lymphatic vessels were dramatically
increased in the mice inoculated with gastric cancer cells (Fig. 1A)
compared with those in control mice. To confirm the increase in
lymphatic vessels in the mice bearing cancer cells, we doublestained the sections of the gastric wall of the mice using LYVE-1, a
specific lymphatic vessel marker, and Ki-67, a marker of cell
proliferation. Some dividing lymphatic endothelial cells stained by
both LYVE-1 and Ki-67 were observed in the gastric wall of the
tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 1B), demonstrating induction of lymphangiogenesis in this model.

We examined whether etodolac, a COX-2 inhibitor, inhibits

lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis in this model.
Etodolac (500 ppm in food) or vehicle control was given p.o.
throughout the experimental period, from inoculation of cancer
cells to evaluation of lymphangiogenesis and lymph node
metastasis. We stained the sections of tumors in the gastric wall
for LYVE-1. As shown in Fig. 1C, tumor lymphangiogenesis was less
prominent in the etodolac-treated mice than in the control mice.
Quantification of LYVE-1–positive areas in hotspots confirmed
these findings (Fig. 1D, left). We also determined the extent of
lymph node metastasis by measuring the total weight of metastatic
lymph nodes identified by expression of GFP using a fluorescence
stereomicroscope (Supplementary Fig. S2). Consistent with the
decrease in density of lymphatic vessels, the total weight of
metastatic lymph nodes was significantly less in etodolac-treated
mice than in the control mice (Fig. 1D, middle).
To determine whether etodolac affects angiogenesis, as well as
lymphangiogenesis, we examined tumor angiogenesis by staining
sections of tumors for PECAM-1. The relative area occupied by
vessels strongly positive for PECAM-1 was significantly decreased
in the etodolac-treated mice compared with the control mice
(Fig. 1D, right).
Lymphatic vessels in the diaphragm in normal mice and
those with carcinomatous peritonitis. To evaluate tumor
lymphangiogenesis in another fashion, we established a new model

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

of lymphangiogenesis, in which the lymphatic vessels of the
diaphragm of mice can be observed. We first observed the
physiologic function and morphologic characteristics of lymphatic
vessels in the diaphragm. Only 20 min after the injection of India
ink into the abdominal cavity, lymphatic vessels in the diaphragm
were stained with the ink (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Lymphatic
vessels in the diaphragm were also observed by whole-mount
immunostaining for LYVE-1 and Prox1 as specific markers of
lymphatic vessels (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Immunostaining of
sections of the diaphragm for LYVE-1 revealed a lymphatic network
consisting of lymphatic lacunae on the peritoneal side and
intermuscular lymphatic vessels (Fig. 2A, left; ref. 33).
Next, we observed the diaphragms of mice with carcinomatous
peritonitis. Two weeks after i.p. inoculation of OCUM-2MLN cells
(5  106) into BALB/c nu/nu mice, cancerous ascites had
accumulated, and dissemination of cancer on the peritoneal
surface of the diaphragm was observed (data not shown). Sections
of diaphragm revealed that these sites of dissemination consisted
of cancer cells and F4/80-positive macrophages (Fig. 2A, right). The
lymphatic vessels in the diaphragm were increased in both size and
number. Outgrowths of the lymphatic vessels into the site of
dissemination were also detected (Fig. 2A).

vessels in the diaphragm can be evaluated not only by using tissue
sections but also by using whole-mount samples. Using this model,
we examined the effects of etodolac on tumor lymphangiogenesis.
Etodolac or vehicle control was continuously given for 2 weeks
from the time of inoculation of cancer cells to evaluation of
lymphangiogenesis. We observed the lymphatic vessels in the
diaphragm by whole-mount immunostaining for LYVE-1 from the
pleural side. More sprouts were detected along lymphatic vessels
over the entire diaphragm in the cancer-inoculated mice than in
the cancer-free mice (Fig. 2B). However, the number of sprouts was
less in the etodolac-treated mice than in the untreated mice
(Fig. 2B). Quantification of lymphatic sprouts revealed significant
reduction of lymphangiogenesis by treatment with etodolac
(Fig. 2C).
Expression of VEGF-C/VEGF-D and COX-2 in tumor tissues.
Macrophages have been suggested to be the major cellular sources
of lymphangiogenic growth factors VEGF-C and VEGF-D (10–12).
To determine whether macrophages are also the major source of
these ligands in our model, we did immunohistochemical staining
for macrophage marker F4/80 and VEGF-C or VEGF-D. In this
model, many cells positive for VEGF-C (Fig. 3A, a) and VEGF-D
(Fig. 3A, b) were F4/80-positive macrophages. Although certain
cancer cells have also been reported to secrete these ligands,
OCUM-2MLN cells were negative for VEGF-C (Fig. 3A, a) and
VEGF-D (Fig. 3A, b) staining. These observations indicate that

macrophages are the major sources of lymphangiogenic growth
factors in this model.
We further examined the expression of COX-2 to determine which
cells are the targets of the COX-2 inhibitor etodolac. Some lymphatic
endothelial cells (Fig. 3B) and OCUM-2MLN cells (Fig. 3C)
expressed COX-2. As shown in Fig. 3C, some F4/80-positive
macrophages were also COX-2 positive. These findings suggest that
etodolac may act on several different types of cells in this model.
We also investigated the expression levels of mouse mRNA for
VEGF-C (Fig. 3D, top) and VEGF-D (Fig. 3D, bottom) in the tumor
tissues. Consistent with the results obtained by immunohistochemical analysis, mRNA level for VEGF-C and VEGF-D increased
in the orthotopically inoculated tumors. In addition, the expression
of VEGF-C, but not that of VEGF-D, was down-regulated after
treatment with etodolac.
Effects of etodolac on macrophages, lymphatic endothelial
cells, and cancer cells in vitro. Given the coexpression of COX-2
and VEGF-C or VEGF-D in macrophages, we hypothesized that
etodolac suppresses the expression of VEGF-C and VEGF-D in
macrophages. To test this hypothesis, we examined the mRNA
levels of VEGF-C and VEGF-D in in vitro–cultured RAW264.7, a
mouse macrophage-like cell line, by quantitative RT-PCR. The
levels of expression of COX-2 (Fig. 4A) and VEGF-C (Fig. 4B) were
dose-dependently up-regulated at 24 h after stimulation with LPS.
The up-regulation of VEGF-C was, however, suppressed by

positive for COX-2. Arrows, triple-positive cells. Scale bar , 20 Am. D, quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mouse mRNA for VEGF-C (mVEGF-C, top ) and mouse mRNA

treatment with etodolac in a dose-dependent fashion. Ten micromolars or higher concentrations of etodolac maximally, although
not completely, suppressed the expression of VEGF-C mRNA
(Fig. 4C). We also examined the expression of VEGF-D, but found
that it was not significantly affected by etodolac (data not shown).
We further examined the effects of etodolac on cells other than
macrophages which are involved in tumor lymphangiogenesis, i.e.,
lymphatic endothelial cells and cancer cells. We used HDLECs to
investigate the effects of etodolac on lymphatic endothelial cells.
The mRNA levels of VEGF-R3 in HDLECs were not affected by
10 Amol/L of etodolac (Fig. 5A). In contrast, cell growth assay
revealed that 3 and 30 Amol/L of etodolac each significantly
suppressed the growth of HDLECs, only upon stimulation with LPS,
although the inhibitory effect of etodolac was not prominent

(Fig. 5B). We also examined the effects of etodolac on the growth
of OCUM-2MLN. However, no significant difference in growth
of OCUM-2MLN cells was observed at 3 days after addition of 3 or
30 Amol/L etodolac (Fig. 5C).
Suppression of lymphangiogenesis by etodolac in a mouse
model of chronic inflammation. We used a mouse model of
chronic inflammation to determine whether the suppressive effect
of etodolac on tumor lymphangiogenesis holds true for inflammatory lymphangiogenesis. In this model, thioglycollate medium
was given i.p. as a proinflammatory agent to induce chronic
aseptic peritonitis. After repeated i.p. injection (thrice a week for
2 weeks) of thioglycollate medium to immunocompetent BALB/c

of mononuclear cells (Fig. 6A, bottom). Immunohistochemical
analysis revealed that COX-2, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D were highly
expressed in these plaques and that many cells positive for VEGF-C
and VEGF-D were F4/80-positive macrophages (Fig. 6B).
Using this model, we examined whether etodolac inhibits
inflammatory lymphangiogenesis. As shown in Fig. 6C, outgrowths
of lymphatic vessels in the plaques were decreased in etodolactreated mice compared with untreated mice. Quantification of
LYVE-1–positive areas in the plaques revealed that induction of
lymphangiogenesis was significantly suppressed in etodolactreated mice compared with control mice (Fig. 6D). These findings
indicate that etodolac is able to suppress lymphangiogenesis in
tumor tissues, as well as in nontumorous tissue.

Discussion
Many clinical and animal studies have shown that COX-2
induces angiogenesis (34). Meanwhile, there is no direct evidence of
a relationship between COX-2 and lymphangiogenesis, although
some clinical and animal studies have suggested that level of COX-2
expression in tumor tissue is correlated with lymph node
metastasis and/or unfavorable prognosis (24–28, 35). However,
none of these studies clearly indicated the status of lymphatic
vessels. In the present study, we investigated the effects of COX-2
inhibitor on lymphatic vessels using the lymphatic endothelial
cell-specific markers LYVE-1 and Prox1. In the model of lymphatic
metastasis, both lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis were induced around the orthotopic tumors of OCUM-2MLN. We found

that administration of etodolac suppressed tumor lymphangiogenesis along with tumor angiogenesis. In addition, we evaluated
the extent of lymph node metastasis and found that the total
weight of metastasized lymph nodes was also decreased by
treatment with etodolac. These findings indicated that COX-2
promotes tumor lymphangiogenesis and consequent lymph node
metastasis, in addition to tumor angiogenesis as previously
reported.
The reproducibility of assignment of highly vascularized areas,
i.e., hotspots in tumor tissue sections, is a critical variable in the
analysis of lymphangiogenesis (36). Finding relevant hotspots
requires training and experience (37). To deal with this potential
problem, we established here a new model of tumor lymphangiogenesis in the diaphragm. Since lymphatic vessels in the diaphragm
can be immunostained in whole-mount preparations, it is possible
to capture the entire network of lymphatics in the diaphragm.
There is no need to pick only hotspots for quantification because
outgrowth of lymphatic vessels was observed over the entire
diaphragm in the model of carcinomatous peritonitis. We
quantified the number of sprouts of lymphatic vessels as a marker
of lymphangiogenesis, as suggested by Baluk et al. (11). The results
using this model confirmed the finding that etodolac suppresses
lymphangiogenesis.
Recent studies have shown that inflammatory cells have
stimulatory effects on tumor progression (38). In particular,
tumor-associated macrophages have been suggested to promote
tumor lymphangiogenesis (10, 39). We therefore hypothesized that
etodolac suppresses the secretion of lymphangiogenic factors from
macrophages. Our finding that some macrophages in tumor
stroma expressed COX-2 strongly supports this hypothesis.
Furthermore, we found that mRNA levels of VEGF-C was indeed
suppressed by etodolac in RAW264.7 cells, as well as in tumor
tissues in vivo. Although these findings are not in agreement with a
previous report that VEGF-C expression in fibroblasts was not
suppressed by indomethacin, a nonselective NSAID (40), this

discrepancy may be due to the difference in cell types examined or
the COX-2 selectivity of drugs used.
Lymphangiogenesis is also induced in chronic inflammatory
lesions (41). Macrophages have recently been shown to be
recruited into inflammatory lesions to secrete VEGF-C and
induce lymphangiogenesis (11, 12). In the present study, using a
model of chronic aseptic peritonitis, we observed that macrophages densely accumulated in inflammatory plaques, wherein
lymphangiogenic growth factors are expressed. These findings
suggest that COX-2 can enhance lymphangiogenesis in the
absence of cancer cells.
We have shown that decrease of lymph node metastasis can be
achieved by COX-2 inhibitor, possibly via inhibition of macrophagemediated lymphangiogenesis. Despite recent studies reporting
cardiovascular complications from long-term administration of
NSAIDs (42), these drugs may still be applicable to cancer
treatment by limiting population and administrating periods:
NSAIDs should be effective for preventing potential metastases in
patients with advanced cancers in presurgical period or in those
having inflammation aroused by surgical manipulation in early
postsurgical periods. In the latter case, surgery-related inflammation may be accompanied by lymphangiogenesis, which can be a
cause of dissemination or metastasis of unexpectedly remained
cancer cells.
In conclusion, we believe that our findings may provide a
potential usage of COX-2 inhibitors in cancer treatment, which
could overcome known obstacles in using these drugs.
