BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to determine whether neuropsychologic functioning differs in breast cancer survivors 6 months after the completion of adjuvant treatment compared with women
without cancer. METHODS: Participants were 187 women who were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in
situ or stage I or stage II breast cancer and 187 age-matched and geographically matched women without
cancer. Of the survivors, 97 had been treated after surgery with chemotherapy only or chemotherapy plus
radiotherapy and 90 had been treated after surgery with radiotherapy only (grading determined according
to the American Joint Committee on Cancer grading system). RESULTS: Small but statistically significant
differences in cognitive functioning and cognitive impairment were observed in those survivors who were
treated with chemotherapy and their matched controls, as well as in survivors treated with radiotherapy
only and their matched controls. No group differences were observed with regard to cognitive symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Data from the current study suggest that cognitive deficits are subtle and likely the result of
the general effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment rather than systemic treatment. Cancer 2009;115:1776–83.

Anecdotal reports of ‘‘chemo brain,’’ or a loss of mental acuity associated with chemotherapy, are

well-publicized among breast cancer survivors1,2 and are a source of significant concern.3 Although selfreported cognitive complaints are not highly correlated with objective neuropsychologic test results,4-6
research indicates that survivors’ concerns are merited. Cognitive deficits appear to be pronounced during
treatment. Cross-sectional data indicate rates of moderate or severe impairment ranging from 16% to 48%
in patients during chemotherapy compared with 4% to 11% in healthy controls.7,8 Moreover, longitudinal studies indicate that cognitive functioning tends to decline during treatment.6,9
The extent to which cognitive deficits persist after treatment is less clear. Among breast cancer survivors 3
to 18 months after chemotherapy, Wieneke et al10 determined that 75% scored at least 2 standard deviations
(SDs) below population norms on 1 tests. Using a longitudinal design, Fan et al11 assessed breast cancer

survivors during chemotherapy, 1 year later, and 2 years later
compared with noncancer controls. Significantly more survivors displayed moderate to severe cognitive impairment at
both follow-up assessment points than controls. Silverman
et al12 examined breast cancer survivors 5 to 10 years after
treatment using positron emission tomography and found
altered frontocortical activation in those who had been
treated with chemotherapy compared with those not treated
with chemotherapy.
In contrast, results from other studies suggest that
the cognitive sequelae of chemotherapy may be transient.
Schagen et al13 found that survivors’ cognitive functioning improved from 2 years to 4 years after chemotherapy,
with survivors performing similarly to controls at 4 years.
Jenkins et al14 examined cognitive functioning in breast
cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, patients receiving
radiotherapy, and noncancer controls before treatment,
6 months after treatment, and 18 months after treatment.
They found no differences between the groups over time.
Finally, we previously reported no differences in cognitive
functioning at 6 months after treatment between survivors
treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy compared
with survivors treated with radiotherapy only.15
Building on our previous report,15 we now present
comparisons between breast cancer survivors assessed
6 months after the completion of treatment and agematched and geographically matched female noncancer controls. The current study included a larger set of patients than
was included in our previous report and also included nonpatient comparison data that were not reported previously.
We hypothesized that survivors treated with chemotherapy
would demonstrate lower mean-level cognitive functioning,
higher rates of cognitive impairment, and greater cognitive
symptoms than their matched controls. To examine whether
hypothesized differences were the result of systemic treatment versus the general effects of cancer, we also examined
cognitive functioning, cognitive impairment, and cognitive
symptoms in breast cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy only compared with their matched controls.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participant Eligibility and Recruitment
Breast Cancer Survivors

As part of a larger, institutional review boardapproved study examining quality of life during and after
Cancer

April 15, 2009

breast cancer treatment, women diagnosed with ductal
carcinoma in situ or stage I or stage II breast cancer were
recruited at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center (HLMCC)
at the University of South Florida and the Markey Cancer
Center (MCC) at the University of Kentucky (grading
determined according to the American Joint Committee
on Cancer grading system). Additional eligibility criteria
were that participants: 1) be at least 18 years of age; 2)
have no documented or observable psychiatric or neurologic disorders that would interfere with study participation (eg, dementia or psychosis); 3) be able to speak and
read standard English; 4) have no history of cancer other
than basal cell skin carcinoma; 6) have been treated surgically with lumpectomy or mastectomy; 7) be scheduled to
receive a minimum of 4 cycles of chemotherapy followed
by radiotherapy (chemotherapy þ radiotherapy group), a
minimum of 4 cycles of chemotherapy only (chemotherapy group), or radiotherapy only after surgery (radiotherapy group); 8) have no prior history of treatment with
either chemotherapy or radiotherapy; 9) have no other
chronic or life-threatening diseases in which fatigue is a
prominent symptom (eg, multiple sclerosis); and 10) provide written informed consent.
Eligibility was determined by chart review and consultation with the attending physician. Eligible women
were recruited and informed consent was obtained during
an outpatient clinic visit before the initiation of chemotherapy (the chemotherapy þ radiotherapy group and the
chemotherapy group) or radiotherapy (radiotherapy
group). Approximately 6 months after the completion of
radiotherapy (chemotherapy þ radiotherapy group and
the radiotherapy group) or chemotherapy (chemotherapy
group), survivors were scheduled for an outpatient
appointment, at which time data relevant to the current
report were collected.
Noncancer Controls

Eligibility criteria for noncancer controls were that
they must: 1) be women within 5 years of the age of the
patient to whom they were being matched; 2) reside in the
same ZIP code as the patient to whom they were being
matched; 3) have no discernable psychiatric or neurologic
disorders that would interfere with study participation; 4)
be able to read and speak standard English; 5) report no
history of cancer other than basal cell skin carcinoma; 6)
report no chronic or life–threatening diseases in which
1777

fatigue is a prominent symptom; and 7) provide written
informed consent.
Potential control participants were identified using a
database maintained by Marketing Systems Group, Inc
(Fort Washington, Pa) that draws from all listed telephone households in the US and is estimated to include
demographic and contact information for approximately
two-thirds of the US population. For each survivor, a list
was generated of 25 randomly selected females who
resided within the same ZIP code as the survivor and were
within 5 years of the survivor’s age. An individual was
selected at random from each list and a letter of introduction was sent out describing the study. If this individual
did not opt out by calling a toll-free telephone number
(HLMCC) or did return a postcard expressing interest
(MCC), telephone contact was initiated to further determine eligibility. If the individual met all eligibility criteria
and agreed to participate, an appointment was set up to
obtain written informed consent and conduct the assessment. If the first individual on the list could not be
reached, was ineligible, declined, or did not keep the
appointment, another individual on the list was randomly
selected and approached. This process continued until a
matched comparison subject was recruited and completed
the assessment that is the focus of this report.
Measures
Demographic and Clinical Data

Demographic data were obtained from all participants via a self-report measure. Survivor disease and treatment information was collected via medical chart review.
Cognitive Performance

Cognitive performance was assessed using a battery of
neuropsychologic tests that were selected based on a review
of published literature at the time of study design.5,10,16,17
Preference was given to tests with demonstrated reliability,
validity, and availability of published norms. The battery
was designed to assess overall intellectual ability as well as 3
major domains of cognitive functioning: episodic memory,
attention, and complex cognition.

Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-R full-scale intelligence quotient scores.18
Episodic Memory

Verbal (California Verbal Learning Test [CVLT])19
and nonverbal (Visual Reproduction subtest of the
Weschler Memory Scales-III [WMS-III])20 measures of
episodic memory were administered. Scores used in analyses were CVLT immediate recall, long delay free recall,
and recognition and WMS-III Visual Reproduction immediate, delayed recall, and delayed recognition.
Attention

The Digit Span subtest of the WAIS-III,21 Spatial
Span subtest of the WAIS-III,21 Trails A subtest of the Trail
Making Test,22 and Ruff 2 & 7 Test23 were administered to
assess attention. Scores used in analyses were the number of
items completed correctly on Digit Span and Spatial Span,
total time to completion on the Trails A subtest, and total
speed and total accuracy on the Ruff 2 & 7 Test.
Complex Cognition

The Digit Symbol subtest of the WAIS-III,21 Trails
B subtest of the Trail Making Test,22 and the Controlled
Oral Word Association (COWA)24 were administered to
assess complex cognition. Scores used in analyses were the
number of items completed on the Digit Symbol subtest,
total time to completion on the Trails B subtest, and total
number of words generated on the COWA.
Self-report Measures
Cognitive Symptoms

The Mental Abilities Questionnaire (MAQ)25 is a
48-item, self-report measure that assesses perceptions of
cognitive functioning. Using a 5-point Likert scale (with
1 indicating almost never and 5 indicating almost always),
respondents rate how often they are able to perform a variety of everyday cognitive tasks compared with other people their age. The MAQ yields a total score and subscale
scores for attention, language, verbal memory, visual-spatial memory, and visual-spatial perception. The Cronbach
a in the current sample was .93 for the total score and
ranged from .72 to .79 for the subscales.

Overall Intellectual Ability

The National Adult Reading Test (NART)18 was
administered to estimate overall intellectual ability.
NART scores were converted to estimated Weschler Adult
1778

Fatigue

The Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI)26 is a 14item measure that assesses the frequency and severity of
Cancer

fatigue and its perceived disruptiveness. Analyses were
conducted using an average of ratings of the degree to
which fatigue interfered (with 0 indicating no interference
and 10 indicating extreme interference) with daily activities, relations with others, enjoyment of life, and mood.
Previous research has demonstrated the reliability and validity of the FSI in women diagnosed with breast
cancer.26,27
Depressive Symptoms

The 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies of
Depression Scale (CES-D)28 identifies current symptoms of
depression. It assess 6 components of depressed mood: guilt
or worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness,
psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbance. Previous research has demonstrated the reliability and
validity of the CESD in individuals with cancer.29,30
Statistical Analyses
Raw test scores on neuropsychologic tests were converted
to standardized scores based on published normative data
to facilitate comparisons between tests. CVLT, Trail
Making Test, and Ruff 2 & 7 Test raw scores were converted to age-corrected and education-corrected z
scores.19,22 COWA raw scores were also converted to agecorrected and education-corrected z scores.24 WMS-III
and WAIS-III subtest raw scores were converted to agecorrected z scores.20,21
Because of the small number of survivors treated with
chemotherapy only (n ¼ 14), the chemotherapy only and
chemotherapy þ radiotherapy groups were combined in all
analyses. Differences with regard to age, race, education, annual household income, and overall intellectual ability (ie,
NART scores) were examined between survivors and matched
controls using the dependent–sample Student t test and
McNemar test. Variables that differed significantly between
groups (P < .05) were entered as covariates in later analyses.
To examine mean-level differences in cognitive
functioning and cognitive symptoms between survivors
and controls, linear mixed models were used. To examine
differences in rates of cognitive impairment, participants
were categorized as impaired or unimpaired on individual
tests and overall. In accordance with previous research,31
impairment on individual tests was defined as 1.5 SD
below the normative mean; overall impairment was

equations were used to determine significant differences
in rates of impairment between survivors and controls.
The study was designed to yield a power of at least .80 to
detect an effect size of .30 at an a of .05.

RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
The clinical characteristics of the survivors are presented
in Table 1 and sociodemographic comparisons between
survivors and controls are presented in Table 2. Compared with controls, survivors treated with chemotherapy
were significantly younger. Survivors treated with radiotherapy only were younger and more likely to have higher
estimated overall intellectual ability. These 2 variables
were included as covariates in all later analyses.

Mean-level Cognitive Performance
As shown in Table 3, when compared with controls, survivors treated with chemotherapy performed significantly
worse on tests assessing episodic memory (WMS-III Visual
Reproduction delayed recall) and complex cognition (Digit
Symbol subtest and COWA). Effect sizes (ds) were small (ds
¼ .19-.24) by Cohen’s criteria.32 Survivors treated with
radiotherapy only performed significantly worse on tests
measuring attention (Trails A) and complex cognition (Trails
B). These effect sizes were also small (ds ¼ .29-.31).32

Post hoc analyses were conducted to explore potential contributing factors to cognitive differences between
survivors and controls. Two additional sets of mixed
model analyses were conducted as described earlier, but
with the inclusion of depressive symptoms and fatigue as
additional covariates. These analyses yielded the same pattern of statistically significant cognitive differences
between survivors and controls as shown in Table 3.
Regression analyses were then conducted to compare
mean-level cognitive differences between: 1) survivors
treated with chemotherapy and tamoxifen and survivors

significant differences were observed (P >.05).
Rates of Impairment
Rates of impairment are shown in Table 4. Survivors
treated with chemotherapy were more likely than controls
to be categorized as impaired in episodic memory (CVLT
recognition). Survivors treated with radiotherapy only
were more likely than controls to be categorized as
impaired in attention (Trails A).
Cognitive Symptoms
No significant differences were found between survivors
and controls with regard to total cognitive symptoms or
subscales of attention, language, verbal memory, visualspatial memory, and visual-spatial perception (P  .18).

DISCUSSION
The current study assessed reports of ‘‘chemo brain,’’ or loss
of mental acuity after chemotherapy, in breast cancer surviCancer

vors 6 months after the completion of adjuvant treatment.
We hypothesized that survivors treated with chemotherapy
would display worse cognitive functioning relative to agematched and geographically matched women without cancer. Findings indicated that survivors treated with chemotherapy displayed poorer episodic memory and attention
than controls, although effect sizes (ds) were small. Survivors treated with chemotherapy also displayed significantly
greater impairment in the domain of episodic memory. To
examine whether differences in cognitive functioning were
due specifically to chemotherapy as opposed to the general
effects of cancer, the current study also compared a group
of survivors who were treated with radiotherapy only with
age-matched and geographically matched controls. Survivors treated with radiotherapy only demonstrated poorer
attention and complex cognition, although effect sizes were
small. Survivors treated with radiotherapy only also demonstrated higher rates of impairment in the domain of attention. There were no differences noted between survivors
and controls with regard to reports of cognitive symptoms.
Taken together, these findings suggest that the cognitive deficits noted in breast cancer survivors are relatively subtle and are the result of the general effects of
1781

Original Article

cancer rather than systemic treatment per se. Follow-up
analyses were conducted to examine whether fatigue or
depressive symptoms accounted for observed cognitive
differences between survivors and controls. The same pattern of cognitive differences emerged when fatigue and
depressive symptoms were statistically controlled, suggesting that differences were not attributable to these factors.
This finding is consistent with previous literature suggesting that neither fatigue nor depression are significantly
associated with objective cognitive functioning.10,11,13,16
Further research is needed to determine mechanisms that
play a role in post-treatment cognitive functioning, such
as cancer-related distress or worry about recurrence.
Post hoc analyses also were conducted to explore
whether hormonal therapy contributed to cognitive differences between survivors and controls. Survivors treated
with tamoxifen did not demonstrate significant differences in cognitive functioning compared with survivors
treated without tamoxifen. Previous research is mixed
regarding the effects of hormonal therapy on post-treatment cognitive functioning. Some studies have reported
that hormonal therapy increases the risk of cognitive deficits,33,34 whereas other studies have reported no effects of
hormonal therapy.5,11,14 Nevertheless, the findings of the
current study regarding tamoxifen should be interpreted
with caution. Because of small numbers of survivors in
some cells, the tamoxifen analyses were likely underpowered. In addition, survivors were not randomly assigned to
treatment in the current study, and thus may be systematically different in ways that were not statistically controlled. Because hormonal treatment is typically initiated
after the completion of adjuvant treatment, some survivors may not have been receiving hormonal treatment
long enough for an effect to be observed. Future research
should examine the role of hormonal therapy in the development of cognitive deficits after breast cancer treatment.
Several strengths characterize the current study.
Women were recruited before the initiation of adjuvant
treatment as part of a longitudinal study examining quality
of life. This may have reduced the potential recruitment
bias of studies designed specifically to assess post-treatment
cognitive functioning.35 With 187 pairs of survivors and
matched controls, the current report is to our knowledge 1
of the largest studies published to date examining cognitive
functioning in cancer survivors. Noncancer controls were
matched with survivors with regard to age and geographic
1782

residence and were recruited using a large database. This is
a significant advantage over survivor-nominated controls,
whose performance may be biased by their relationship to
the survivor. Moreover, the inclusion of survivors treated
with radiotherapy only and matched controls permits examination of the specific effects of chemotherapy compared
with the general effects of cancer on cognitive functioning.
However, the current study was not without limitations.
Survivors were not evaluated before the initiation of adjuvant treatment, and therefore it is unclear whether the current findings reflect an improvement, deterioration, or no
change from baseline. Well-powered longitudinal studies
are needed to clarify cognitive changes over time in breast
cancer survivors compared with women without cancer.
In summary, data from the current study suggest
that, on average, women treated for breast cancer display
subtle cognitive deficits when compared with women
without cancer. Areas of specific deficits were noted
regardless of treatment type, suggesting that mechanisms
other than chemotherapy may affect cognitive functioning. Future research is needed to identify these mechanisms. In addition, rates of impairment in the current
study indicate that there appear to be a subset of survivors for whom cognitive deficits are pronounced. Additional efforts to evaluate and remediate these deficits are
needed.
