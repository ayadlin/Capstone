BACKGROUND. 20S-protopanaxadiol (aPPD) is a major gastrointestinal metabolic
product of ginsenosides. The latter share structural similarity with steroids and
are the main pharmacologically active component in ginseng.

METHODS. The authors investigated the interaction between aPPD and estrogen
receptors (ER) in human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells through receptor
binding assay, ER-induced gene expression, and cell proliferation both in vitro
and in vivo.

RESULTS. aPPD, but not its close analog ginsenosides, competed with the [3H]17-b estradiol (E2) for ER with IC50 at 26.3 lM. aPPD alone weakly induced luciferase reporter-gene expression controlled by an estrogen-regulated element,
which was completely blocked by tamoxifen. aPPD alone, or in synergy with tamoxifen, blocked E2-induced transcriptional activation. aPPD also inhibited colony formation of endometrial cancer cells. aPPD potently inhibited estrogenstimulated MCF-7 cell proliferation and synergistically enhanced the cytotoxicity
of tamoxifen on both ER1 MCF-7 and ER MDA-MB231 cells. Furthermore,
aPPD, but not tamoxifen, inhibited Akt phosphorylation. Growth of MCF-7 xenograft tumor supplemented with E2 was completely inhibited in animals treated
with aPPD, tamoxifen, or aPPD plus tamoxifen.

CONCLUSIONS. These results suggested that aPPD inhibits estrogen-stimulated
gene expression and cell proliferation in ER-positive breast cancer cells. In addition, aPPD synergistically enhances cytotoxicity of tamoxifen in an ER-independent fashion, probably by down-regulating Akt activity. Cancer 2007;109:2374–82.

linical experimental and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that high estrogen levels play a key role in breast cancer
formation and progression.1–3 The antiestrogen agent tamoxifen is
widely used as a therapeutic to treat breast cancer.4–6 The mechanism
of tamoxifen-induced tumor inhibition has been demonstrated to be
due to both estrogen-receptor mediation and tamoxifen cytotoxicity.7
However, the development of multidrug resistance in breast cancer
cells and the potential of carcinogenic effects in uterine tissue have
limited the efficacy of tamoxifen.4,8–11 Discovery of potential alternatives to tamoxifen for the treatment of breast cancer is an important
objective.
Ginsenosides are steroid saponins present in ginsengs. They possess a 4 trans-ring rigid steroid skeleton with modified side chains at
C20. According to the number of hydroxyl groups on the structure,
most ginsenosides can be classified into either the protopanaxatriol
(PPT) or the protopanaxadiol (PPD) group.12 As the ginsenosides

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and Reagents
17-b estradiol and tamoxifen were purchased from
Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, Mo). [3H]-17-b estradiol (89 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Perkin Elmer
(Waltham, Mass). DNA purification Kit was bought
from Qiagen USA (Germantown, Md). Lipofectamin
2000 was purchased from Invitrogen Life Technology
(Carlsbad, Calif). Luciferase assay system and b-glycosidase assay kit were purchased from Promega
(Madison, Wis). Fetal calf serum and DMEM were
bought from Invitrogen (Burlington, Ont, Canada). All
remaining chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The
20S-protopanaxandiol (aPPD) was supplied by Pegasus
Pharmaceuticals Inc., (Richmond, BC, Canada). The
purity of the compound was 97.5% determined by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Plasmid EREII-Luc was a gift from Dr. Peter J. Kushner
(University of California at San Francisco).

share a backbone similar to steroidal hormones (Fig.
1a, b), some of the ginsenosides have been shown to
bind to the same target proteins as steroidal hormones, including estrogen receptors.13–16 It has been
reported that ginsenoside Rg1 has estrogen-like activity, stimulates breast cancer cell growth, and activates
an estrogen-regulated element transcription in HeLa
cells in vitro, and its activity is blocked by estrogen
antagonist ICI 182780.17 On the other hand, numerous
studies have demonstrated that some ginsenosides
possess anticancer activities that may not relate to
estrogen receptors.18–20
Recent studies have demonstrated that most ginsenosides are metabolized to their aglycones in the
gastrointestinal track as forms of 20S-protopanaxadiol
(aglycone PPD or aPPD) and 20S-protropanaxatriol
(aPPT).21,22 Our previous studies demonstrated that
aPPD induced apoptosis in various tumor cells involving both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways.23 Extremely low toxicity of aPPD on
normal tissues renders it a candidate for an anticancer
drug. The present study goals were to determine
whether aPPD and its close analogs can interact with
estrogen receptors and to determine effects of aPPD
on estrogen-stimulated tumor cell proliferation.

Whole Cell Binding Assay
Breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 was a gift
from British Columbia Cancer Agency. The cells in
phenol red-free Dulbecco Modified Eagle Media
(DMEM) containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (FBS) were seeded in a 24-well plate
(80,000 cells/well). The whole cell-binding assay was
carried out as described by Lee.13 Briefly, the cells
were incubated in serum-free medium for 60 minutes with 10 nM [3H]-17-b estradiol and increasing
concentrations of aPPD, aPPT, Rh2, and Rg3. The
same medium with 0.2% ethanol was used as vehicle
control. Then, the cells were washed with ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 3 times. The bound
and intracellular [3H]-17-b estradiol were extracted
with cold absolute ethanol, and the radioactivity was
measured in a b-scintillation counter (LS6500 multipurpose counter; Beckman Coulter; Fullerton, Calif).
To determine the total nonspecific binding, a 200fold excess of unlabeled 17-b estradiol was added to
the above binding medium. Binding data were analyzed using a Scatchard analysis. Data presented
were averages of at least 3 independent experiments
with triplicate measurements for each time point.
Reporter Gene Transfection and Luciferase Assays
A reporter-gene construct, pEREII, contains an estrogen response element in front of a luciferase reporter
gene. MCF-7 cells were plated in each well of 24-well
plates 1 day before transfection with the reportergene construct by using Lipofectamin2000. The
cells were subjected to transfection in triplicate with
0.1 lg of EREII-Luc and 0.2 lg of a CMV-LacZ con-

struct as an internal control. Four hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of
DMEM medium with 5% charcoal-stripped FBS,
10 nM E2, and/or 2.5lM or 20 lM aPPD, and/or
0.5 lM or 10 lM tamoxifen. After 24 hours, the cells
were washed with Mg21-free and Ca21-free PBS twice
and ruptured with lysis buffer. The lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 minute. The supernatant
(20 lL) was mixed with 80 lL luciferase assay buffer.
The chemiluminescence was measured for 1 second
with a microplate luminometer (Berthold; Oak Ridge,
Tenn). For the b-glycosidase assay, 50 lL of supernatant was mixed with 50 lL 23 assay buffer followed
by incubation at 378C for 30 minutes. The reaction
was stopped by adding 500 lL of 1 M sodium carbonate, and the absorbance of the reaction was
measured at 420 nm with lQuant BioTek (BioTek
Instruments; Winooski, Vt). Relative luciferase activity was calculated by normalizing the absolute luciferase activity with that of b-glycosidase activity in
each well.

Cell Viability Assay
MCF-7 or MDA-MB231 cells were grown in phenol
red-free DMEM supplemented with charcoalstripped 2% fetal bovin serum (FBS) for 5 days. Five
thousand cells per well were plated in 96-well plates
in the above medium. The next day, the culture medium was removed by aspiration and 200 lL of fresh
medium containing 10 nM estradiol (E2), and 0, 1, 2.5,
5, 10 or 15 lM of tamoxifen with or without 10 lM
aPPD was added. Estrogen-receptor negative MDAMB231 (from the American Type Culture Collection;
Manassas, Va) cells were treated similarly but without
E2. After 2 days of treatment, the cell proliferation was
determined by MTT assay. Briefly, the medium was
removed and replaced with 50 lL of 0.5 mg/mL MTT.
The cells were incubated in a CO2 incubator for
4 hours, and the purple crystal was solubilized with
100 lL of lysis buffer overnight. The optical density
(O.D.) of each well was measured on a spectrophotometer at 570 nm with the lQuant BioTek.
Western Blot
MCF-7 cells cultured in 6-well plates were treated
with 10 lM aPPD, 5 lM tamoxifen, or a combination
of both. The cells were grown for 5.5 hours and
washed once before lysis buffer was added. Protein
samples (40–100 lg/lane) were separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide electrophoresis
gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes
(Bio-Rad Laboratories; Hercules, Calif). The transferred membranes were probed by using anti-Phos-

pho-Akt (Ser473) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology;
Danvers, Mass). The membranes were regenerated
and probed with anti–b-Actin antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology) for normalization. The amount of proteins was measured by densitometry with Image Station 440 (Kodak; Rochester, NY) and analyzed with
Kodak 1D3.6 to quantify the levels of phosphorylated
Akt/PKB.

MCF-7 Xenograft Model in SCID Mice
Female severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
mice were obtained from the British Columbia Cancer Agency at the age of 4 weeks. One day before
xenografts were implanted, a 43 1.98 mm Silastic
(an inert silicone elastomer) E2-releasing pellet was
subcutaneously implanted on the near axillary area
of the mouse. Mice in the control group received a
pellet containing no E2. Ten million MCF-7 cells
were subcutaneously inoculated in mice on the rear
axillary area. All procedures were approved by the
animal care committee at the University of British
Columbia.
The mice were treated with aPPD and tamoxifen
daily for 31 days starting from the second day posttumor inoculation. The animals were divided into 5
groups as follows: 1) E21 vehicle (n ¼ 4); 2) E21
aPPD 10 mg/kg/day (n ¼ 6); 3) E21 aPPD 10 mg/kg/
day plus tamoxifen 1.5 mg/kg/day (n ¼ 7); 4) E21 tamoxifen 1.5 mg/kg/day (n ¼ 7); 5) E2-negative control (n ¼ 4). Tamoxifen citrate was administered
intraperitoneally whereas aPPD was administered
orally. The mice were observed daily, and the size of
each tumor was measured every other day with electronic calipers from the 10th day post-tumor implantation. Tumor volumes were calculated as a function
of (length 3 width 3 height 3 3.14) 7 6. An average
tumor size per mouse was used to calculate the
group mean tumor size  standard error of the
mean (SEM).
Measurement of Sera Estradiol Level
Serum E2 level in each mouse was determined by
commercial ELISA kit (Biocheck; Foster City, Calif ),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and absorbance at 450 nm was determined with a lQuant
BioTek.
Statistics
All in vitro experiments were conducted at least
twice independently, with 3–4 repeats at each data
point. Student t-test was performed for statistical
analysis.

FIGURE 2. Whole cell binding assay of ginsenosides to the estrogen
receptors. MCF-7 cells were incubated with 10 nmol of [3H]-17-b estradiol,
in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled aPPD,
aPPT, Rh2, or Rg3 for 60 minutes. aPPD but not other ginsenosides competed with [3H]-E2 for the ERs in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 of
aPPD was 26.3, whereas [3H]-17-b estradiol had an IC50 of 70 nmol.

RESULTS
aPPD was a Low-Affinity but a Specific ER Binder
Whole cell binding assays were carried out to test
whether Rg3, Rh2, aPPD, and aPPT could bind to
estrogen receptors (ERs). ER-positive MCF-7 cells, of
which estrogen-receptor–a was predominant, were
incubated in the presence of 10 nmol [3H]-17-b estradiol and increasing concentrations of unlabeled
aPPD or other ginsenoside as competitors. As shown
in Figure 2, aPPD inhibited the binding of [3H]-17-b
estradiol to its receptors with an estimated IC50 of
26.3  2.1 lM. As a comparison, [3H]-17-b estradiol
has the IC50 of 70  4.3 nM, suggesting that the
affinity of aPPD to estrogen receptors was 370-fold
less than estrogen itself. Interestingly, Rg3, Rh2, and
aPPT did not bind to E2 receptors, even though all
share similar structures to aPPD.

aPPD Weakly Stimulated ER-mediated
Reporter-Gene Expression
To investigate whether the binding of aPPD to ER
could induce the expression of ER-regulated genes, a
construct with a luciferase gene downstream to a
promoter-containing ER regulatory element was subjected to transfection into ER-positive MCF-7 cells.
As illustrated in Figure 3a, aPPD (2.5 lM, 5 lM, 10 lM,
respectively) activated the ER regulatory element
luciferase gene transcription. Compared with background expression, 2.5 lM and 5 lM aPPD increased
luciferase expression by 8.48-fold (1.72) and 10.32fold (1.14) (P <.05), respectively. To confirm the
specificity of aPPD on ER-mediated transactivation,
we examined whether tamoxifen, a specific ER antagonist, could inhibit the effect of aPPD. As shown in

centage of E2-induced ER regulatory element luciferase activity. The IC50 for
tamoxifen and aPPD were 2.8 lM and 12.5 lM, respectively; **P < .01,

versus E2 plus aPPD plus Tam group.

Figure 3a, 5 lM of tamoxifen completely blocked
aPPD-induced reporter-gene expression. Therefore,
the aPPD-stimulated luciferase transcription was
specifically mediated by ERs, which also supports
that aPPD is able to bind to ER specifically. It may
worth noting that the potency of aPPD for stimulating ER-mediated gene expression was approximately
10-fold less than estrogen itself.

aPPD Inhibited E2-Stimulated Gene Expression
To investigate whether aPPD inhibits E2-induced ER
regulatory element activity, E2 stimulated luciferase
activity was measured in MCF-7 cells in the presence
of aPPD or tamoxifen. As shown in Figure 3b, both
aPPD and tamoxifen inhibited E2-induced ER regulatory element luciferase transcription in a dosedependent manner, with an IC50 of 12.5 lM and
2.8 lM, respectively. Figure 3c showed that 5 lM
aPPD alone reduced E2-stimulated ER regulatory
element luciferase transcription to 82.1%  2.3%
(P <.01) of the control. Tamoxifen combined with 5
lM aPPD synergistically inhibited E2-stimulated
gene expression (P <.01). Tamoxifen alone (0.5lM
and 1 lM) had no effect on E2-induced reporter
gene expression (102.5%  2.5% and 106.4%  9.3%,
respectively, P >.1), but the same concentrations of
tamoxifen together with 5 lM aPPD reduced reporter-gene expression to 63.4%  1.5% and
38.8%  1.6% of the control level (P <.01), respectively, which were significantly more than the sum of
effects of aPPD and tamoxifen alone.
aPPD Inhibited Colony Formation of Endometrial
Cancer Cells
Because tamoxifen has been shown to be an antagonist in breast cancer cells but an agonist in uterine
tissue to stimulate endometrial cancer cell growth,12
it is important to know whether aPPD performs in
the same manner. Colony-formation assay was performed by using MCF-7 and the Ishikawa endometrial cancer cell line. The cells were grown on soft
agar (0.5% agar, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 13
DMEM) with either 10 nM of E2 or 5 lM of aPPD for
14 days. Colonies of > 20 cells were counted. As
shown in Figure 4, aPPD significantly inhibited colony formation of both MCF-7 and Ishikawa cells
whereas E2 significantly stimulated it.
aPPD Inhibited E2-Stimulated MCF-7 Proliferation and
Synergistically Enhanced Tamoxifen Cytotoxicity
To evaluate the effects of aPPD on ER-stimulated cell
growth, the proliferation assay was performed on the
MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. MCF-7 cells were
treated for 48 hours with 10 nM E2 plus 0 lM to
15 lM tamoxifen in the presence or absence of 10 lM
aPPD. E2 increased the MCF-7 cell growth by
17.0%  0.08% (P <.05) compared with a vehicletreated control. As shown in Figure 5a, 10 lM aPPD
as well as tamoxifen (1lM to 5 lM) completely abrogated the E2-stimulated cell growth (P <.05). Significant cytotoxicity of tamoxifen was observed at
concentrations of 10 lM and 15 lM, resulting in
25.2% and 99.8% cell death even in the presence of

FIGURE 4. Colony-formation assay for MCF-7 cells and Ishikawa cell line
endometrial cancer cells. Ten thousand cells were seeded on 0.5% gel with
5 lM aPPD, 10 nM estrogen (E2), or medium control. The colonies were
counted by Day 14. The data are shown as means of at least 4 individual
plates from 2 repeated experiments. (*P < .02 vs control; **P < .002 vs control).

10 nM E2 compared with untreated control cell
cultures (Fig. 5a). The cytotoxic effect of tamoxifen
was greatly increased by 10 lM aPPD in a synergistic
fashion as shown in Figure 5a and c. The synergy
was further analyzed by the software CompuSyn
(Biosoft, Cambridge, UK), and the results (Fig. 5c)
confirmed that 10 lM of aPPD combined with 5 lM,
10 lM, and 15 lM of tamoxifen were synergistic.

Synergistic Cytotoxicity Between aPPD and Tamoxifen
was ER Independent
To ask whether the synergistic cytotoxicities of aPPD
and tamoxifen were ER dependent, ER-negative
MDA-MB231 cells were treated with aPPD and tamoxifen at various combinations of concentrations.
MDA-MB231 cells were slightly more sensitive to the
cytotoxicity induced by either tamoxifen or aPPD
than MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5b). But more importantly,
marked synergy between aPPD and tamoxifen was
also evident. As shown in Figure 5b, when the concentration of tamoxifen was 0 lM (aPPD alone),
treatment with 5 lM aPPD caused  20% cell death
on MDA-MB231 cells. The combination of 2.5 lM tamoxifen (cell viability was 89.3  1.8% applied
alone), and 5lM aPPD had significant synergy to
cause > 95% cell death (cell viability was 4.7 
0.9%). CompuSyn analysis (Fig. 5c) further showed a
significant synergy for 5 lM of aPPD in combination
with < 10 lM tamoxifen.
aPPD Inhibited Phosphorylation of Akt
In an effort to understand the mechanism of the
synergy between aPPD and tamoxifen, we examined
the levels of phosphorylated Akt/PKB in MCF-7 cells

aPPD and tamoxifen, because activation of Akt by
phosphorylation has been reported to play a role in
tamoxifen resistance in MCF-7cells.24,25 As shown in
Figure 6, levels of phosphorylated Akt were significantly reduced by aPPD (10 lM) or by aPPD

aPPD Inhibited ER-Dependent Tumor Growth
in a Breast Cancer Animal Model
To confirm the inhibitory effect of aPPD on ER-dependent tumor growth, aPPD was orally administered to animals bearing MCF-7 tumors with a
subcutaneously implanted Silastic E2 pellet (Fig. 7).
Whereas the mean E2 plasma levels in animals of
E2-supplemented control and treatment groups varied from 445 pg/mL to 758 pg/mL, there were no significant differences among those groups (Table 1). In
addition, correlation coefficient analysis of samples
from the E21 control group indicated no correlation
between the E2 level and tumor size (r ¼ 0.15,
P >.05), suggesting that the E2 concentrations in
E2-supplemented animals were sufficient to support
tumor growth. The tumor became measurable 1
week after implantation, and the measurement
started on Day 10 postimplantation. As shown in
Table 2, the tumor volume was > 70-fold greater
in E2-supplemented animals than that in the non–

E2-supplemented control group at Day 31 postimplantation. In the non-E2 supplemented control
group, a measurable transient tumor growth was
observed at Day 10 postimplantation. However, the
tumor regressed afterward, from an average volume
of 0.42 (0.25) mm3 to 0.13 (0.08) mm3 by Day 29,
indicating that the intrinsic E2 level was not sufficient to support the progression of xenografts. In animals with estradiol support but treated orally with
aPPD, the initial tumor volume (10 days postimplantation) was 0.05 (0.00) mm3, which was 13% of that
of the non–E2-supplemented group. Tumors in the
aPPD-treated animal group decreased to immeasurable size by Day 15. Tamoxifen (3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally administered) also effectively inhibited tumor
growth (7 of 7 mice, P <.01.). Animals treated with
the combination of 10 mg/kg aPPD plus 1.5 mg/kg
tamoxifen also had a complete inhibition of tumor
growth. By Day 31, there were no significant differences among any of the treatment groups and the
non–E2-supplemented group in tumor sizes. It is
worthwhile to notice that there was a significant
difference in tumor sizes on the first day of measurement (Day 10 postimplantation) among the treatment groups. Mean tumor volume of the tamoxifenonly group is significantly larger than the aPPD
group or the aPPD plus tamoxifen combined treatment group (P <.01), which may reflect a difference
in potency of these treatments (Table 2). There was
no toxicity in animals, even as high as 60 mg/kg/day

in 1 of our preliminary experiments (data not
shown), suggesting that aPPD is a very safe compound in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Because ginseng is 1 of the most widely used medicinal herbs in the world, it is important to understand
the bioactivity of its major metabolite, such as aPPD.
The present study is the first to show that 1) aPPD
can bind to estrogen receptors with a low affinity but
not to its close structural analogs Rh2, Rg3, and
aPPT; 2) aPPD weakly, but specifically, activates the
estrogen receptor, as demonstrated by its ability to
stimulate ER regulatory element-mediated reportergene expression; 3) aPPD competes with estradiol for
E2 receptors and blocks estradiol’s ability to stimulate ER regulatory element-mediated gene expression; 4) aPPD blocks E2-stimulated breast cancer cell
proliferation both in vitro and in vivo; 5) aPPD synergistically enhances the potency of tamoxifen as an
antagonist of E2-stimulated gene expression and as a
cytotoxic agent (The latter is ER-independent.); 6)
aPPD, but not tamoxifen, reduced levels of phosphorylated Akt at a concentration where a synergy was
manifested.
The present results suggest that aPPD is a partial
agonist and antagonist for estrogen receptors. Compounds with similar characters have been known as
selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs).9,10

aPPD on Breast Cancer/Yu et al.

SERMs bind to estrogen receptors and have tissuespecific effects that allow them to function as estrogen agonists in some tissues and as estrogen antagonists in other tissues. These compounds include
clomiphene citrate, tamoxifen, toremifene, and raloxifene.26,27 The molecular mechanisms of SERM activity
are believed to be due to conformational modifications
of the estrogen-receptor protein after binding with different ligands, altering the receptor affinity to other
proteins associated with its physiological activity.28
Tamoxifen has been widely used in prevention and
treatment of breast cancer because of its estrogen
antagonistic activity. However, tamoxifen also has an
estrogen-like effect on lipids, bone, and the endometrium.29,30 The agonistic effect on endometrium may
relate to tamoxifen’s reported contribution to the
initiation and progression of endometrial cancer.11
Although it is still not clear whether aPPD is a true
SERM at the present time, here we have shown that
aPPD significantly inhibited colony formation of endometrial cancer cells and, therefore, will be unlikely to
stimulate tumor growth in uterine tissue. The estrogen-related activity of aPPD remains to be investigated
in cells of other tissue origins, and its conformational
effect on estrogen-receptor protein after binding needs
to be understood.
Another important finding from the present study
is that aPPD can synergistically act with tamoxifen to
either block estrogen activity on gene regulation or
abolish estrogen-stimulated cell proliferation. Tamoxifen has a known cytotoxicity, possibly related to
activation of caspases, elevation of intracellular calcium level, and inhibition of the insulin-like growthfactor pathway.7,31 Tamoxifen is also known for its
chemosensitizing effect when used in combination
with other cytotoxic agents.32,33 aPPD can also
induce apoptosis in various cancer cells through
caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways.23 The synergistic cytotoxicity of tamoxifen and
aPPD in breast cancer cells occurred at concentrations of 5 lM and 10 lM for each compound,
respectively. The synergistic cytotoxicity apparently
is independent of ER, as strong synergy was also
observed in ER-negative cells MDA-MB231. Conversely, the synergy between aPPD and tamoxifen was
also demonstrated in their combined inhibition of
estrogen-stimulated gene regulation. As shown in
Figure 3c, ER regulatory element-regulated gene
expression in the presence of E2 was significantly
suppressed to a much greater extent when cells
were treated with aPPD and tamoxifen in combination rather than with each compound alone. In this
case, there was no cytotoxicity shown by cell-viability assay (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that

2381

the synergy between aPPD and tamoxifen occurred
as both antiestrogenic and cytotoxic effects on the
breast adenocarcinoma cells.
Even though the mechanism of the synergy
between aPPD and tamoxifen remains to be further
studied, our present results show that inhibition of
Akt activity by aPPD is likely 1 of the reasons that
cause aPPD-induced enhancement of tamoxifen cytotoxicity. As a key kinase in the cell survival pathway, Akt has been found to play a crucial role in
development of resistance to tamoxifen in breast
cancer cells, including MCF-7. It has been found that
overexpression of phosphorylated Akt was associated
with tamoxifen-resistant and ICI182,780-resistant
cell lines,34 and expression of constitutively active
Akt in MCF-7 cells reverses estrogen and tamoxifen
responsiveness.24,25 It has been further shown that
inhibition of mTOR activity, a downstream element
in the Akt pathway, restores tamoxifen response in
breast cancer cells with aberrant Akt activity.35
Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that aPPD-caused
inhibition in Akt activity sensitizes MCF-7 cells to
tamoxifen-induced cytotoxicity, which is a possible
mechanism underlying the synergy between aPPD
and tamoxifen.
Our animal breast tumor model data showed
that orally taken aPPD at 10mg/kg/day completely
inhibited the growth of estrogen-supplemented
breast cancer and was as effective as 3 mg/kg intraperitoneally administered tamoxifen. Although pharmacokinetics study is needed to verify drug concentrations in the blood and tissues, our present results
suggest that oral aPPD at this dose can reach therapeutic levels in vivo. This is in agreement with several previous studies that have demonstrated that
intestinal bacterial metabolites of ginseng or ginsenosides were easily absorbed and appeared in
plasma of rats or humans.22,36–38 The synergistic
effects between tamoxifen and aPPD may also contribute to the powerful inhibition in estrogen-dependent breast cancer growth in the animal model.
As shown in Table 2, tumor sizes on Day 10 postimplantation in tamoxifen or aPPD groups were significantly larger (P <.01, E2 and aPPD; or P <.05, E2
and tamoxifen) than the group who received both
tamoxifen and aPPD, suggesting that the combination treatment was more effective in suppressing
estrogen-dependent tumor growth.
Our present study demonstrates that aPPD merits further study for its potential as a new drug for
prevention and treatment of estrogen-regulated neoplasms. Its synergy with tamoxifen also deserves further investigation for potential clinical application in
tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer treatment.
