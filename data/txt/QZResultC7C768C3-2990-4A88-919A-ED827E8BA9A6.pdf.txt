Abstract
BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) elicit therapeutic responses in metastatic melanoma, but alarmingly, also induce the formation of
secondary benign and malignant skin tumors. Here, we report
the emergence and molecular characterization of 73 skin and
extracutaneous tumors in 31 patients who underwent BRAFi
therapy. The majority of patients presented with classic epidermal tumors such as verrucous papillomas, keratoacanthomas,
and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). However, 15 patients
exhibited new or rapidly progressing tumors distinct from these
classic subtypes, such as lymph node metastasis, new melanomas, and genital and oral mucosal SCCs. Genotyping of the

tumors revealed that oncogenic RAS mutations were found in
58% of the evaluable tumor samples (38/66) and 49% of the
control tumors from patients not treated with BRAFi (30/62).
Notably, proximity ligation assays demonstrated that BRAF–
CRAF heterodimerization was increased in ﬁxed tumor samples
from BRAFi-treated patients compared with untreated
patients. Our ﬁndings reveal that BRAF–CRAF complex formation is signiﬁcantly associated with BRAFi treatment, and may
therefore serve as a useful biomarker of BRAFi-induced cutaneous and extracutaneous tumor formation. Cancer Res; 76(6);

Introduction

with previous standard chemotherapy (2). However, BRAF inhibitors have two major drawbacks. First, their action is limited over
time with most patients developing secondary resistance in 6 to 8
months (3). Second, they are frequently associated with the
emergence of multiple benign and malignant skin tumors: papillomas, keratoacanthomas (KA), squamous cell carcinomas
(SCC), and more rarely with atypical pigmented nevi and even
new melanomas (4). These rather unexpected adverse events had
already been reported with the use of a previous less potent and
less selective RAF inhibitor, sorafenib (5) that was used for its antiVEGFR properties. The hypothesis that skin tumors arising with
sorafenib were linked to the anti-RAF effect of the drug has already
been demonstrated in vitro on keratinocytes that showed paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway via CRAF activation
associated with the presence of BRAF/CRAF heterodimers in the
presence of sorafenib (6–8). As might have been expected from
these data, more potent and more selective BRAF inhibitors, such
as vemurafenib and dabrafenib, which became available some
years later, gave rise to a higher incidence of new skin tumors,
occurring in up to 15% to 20% of the patients. These secondary
tumors harbor a RAS mutation in 21% to 60% of the cases (9, 10).
In line with these ﬁndings, in vitro data on melanoma cell lines
harboring an NRAS mutation but wild type for BRAF, showed
paradoxical MAPK pathway activation in the presence of BRAF
inhibitors. In these models, the signal was transduced via CRAF,
itself transactivated via its dimerization with BRAF (11–13).
As RAS mutations can occur in various benign tumors from
diverse tissues and organs, the worrisome question of whether
extracutaneous cancer could be induced by a BRAF inhibitor

Activating BRAF mutations occur in about 7% of human
malignancies and in approximately 40% of melanomas (1). BRAF
inhibitors, vemurafenib and dabrafenib, induce objective tumor
responses in 50% to 60% of the patients with BRAFV600 metastatic melanoma, and prolong their overall survival compared

BRAF–CRAF Heterodimers in BRAF Inhibitor-Treated Tumors

was logically raised. Recently, the report on a patient with
NRASmut myelomonocytic leukemia (14) seemingly aggravated
by vemurafenib was the ﬁrst of these dreaded cases. We
report here on a series of skin and extracutaneous tumors
arising or progressing rapidly under BRAF inhibitors. These
cases, as well as tumors originating from patients without
BRAF inhibitor treatment, were screened for the presence of
oncogenic hotspot mutations in 47 oncogenes of interest, the
level of ERK phosphorylation, and the level of BRAF–
CRAF dimerization. The mechanism of reactivation of the
MAPK pathway leading to ERK phosphorylation was explored
with a newly developed test allowing BRAF–CRAF heterodimerization to be visualized directly on patient tumor
specimens.

Patients and Methods
Patients
All patients had unresectable metastatic BRAFV600 melanoma
except for one patient who had a BRAFV600E anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. They were all treated at Gustave Roussy
except patient #20 who was treated in Reims Hospital, and they
were all still on treatment with a BRAF inhibitor on the day of the
tumor biopsy/excision. They were treated with vemurafenib (960
mg twice daily; N ¼ 28) or with dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily; N
¼ 3) for at least 20 days. Patients were treated in the context of
BRIM-3 (NCT01006980) or VE-BASKET (NCT 01524978) clinical
trials, or according of the EMA authorization and they all gave
their written informed consent for molecular analyses of their
biopsied specimens (IRB# 08-027).

Genotyping
A genetic analysis was performed on 119 evaluable samples, 12
biopsy specimens were too small to allow DNA extraction. The
evaluable samples included 57 from patients treated with a BRAF
inhibitor, and 62 control spontaneous tumors. Genomic DNA
was extracted from 10- to 20-mm thick parafﬁn-embedded
unstained slides of each skin lesion using the DNeasy Blood and
Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
A Ion AmpliSeq primer pools targeting was designed to target
mutations/deletions within the following gene regions of interest
including: HRAS (exons 2 and 3), KRAS (exons 2 to 4), NRAS (exons
2 and 3), NF1, NF2, RAC1, BRAF, MAP2K1, MAP2K2, AKT1, AKT2,

FLT3, JAK2, and KIT (exons 11, 13, and 17). The multiplex PCRbased Target sequencing was performed with the Ion AmpliSeq
Library Kit 2.0 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life
Technologies). An equal amount of each sample libraries were
pooled and Emulsion PCR ampliﬁcation was carried out with
the Ion PGM Template OT2 200 Kit (Life Technologies). After
enrichment, the Sequencing was performed using 316 v.2 Ion
Sequencing Chip according to the Ion PGM 200 Sequencing Kit
with Personal Genome Machine (PGM; Life Technologies).
Median coverage depth over 500 reads per amplicon (500)
was obtained for each analysis allowing detection of hot-spot
variants down to 5% of allele frequency. The data were analyzed with the Torrent Suite Variant Caller 4.2 software and
reported somatic variants were compared with the reference
genome hg19. The germline variants found in 1000 Genome

1478 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

database (16) and/or In Exome Sequencing Project (ESP)
database (ref: Exome Sequencing Project, ESP) were ﬁlter-out,
and all remaining variants were conﬁrmed by visualizing the
data through Alamut v2.4.2 (the gene browser supporting
human genes; Interactive Biosoftware).
Cell culture
SK-Mel2 and CRL-2885 Schwann cell lines were purchased
directly from the ATCC cell bank in 2011 and 2014, respectively.
The ATCC cell line characterization method is a short tandem
repeat DNA proﬁling. Both cell lines were passaged in our laboratory for fewer than 6 months after resuscitation. The MEL-10
cell line was obtained from Laurence Zitvogel's laboratory and its
mutational status checked using the 316 v.2 Ion Sequencing Chip
according to the Ion PGM 200 sequencing Kit with Personal
Genome Machine (PGM; Life Technologies). The SK-Mel2 cell
line was cultured in EMEM and both the MEL10 melanoma cell
line and the CRL-2885 Schwann cell line were cultured in DMEM,

Analyses on patients' tumor specimens
Seventy-three tumor samples originating from 31 patients
treated with BRAF inhibitors were analyzed (Supplementary Table
S1). To be able to evaluate the effect of the treatment on their
healthy-looking skin, 6 of these 31 patients, plus 3 additional
patients who never developed a secondary tumor (patient #9, 10
and 15), agreed to undergo a normal skin biopsy, before and/or
after the initiation of BRAF inhibitor treatment, which enabled us
to study 16 additional "normal skin" specimens. A series of
control tumors were analyzed as controls: 13 verrucous papillomas, 13 KA or SCCs, 10 vulvar SCCs, 10 urothelial carcinomas, 10
NRASmut melanomas, 7 melanocytic congenital nevi, originating
from 63 patients who were not treated with a BRAF inhibitor
(Supplementary Table S2).
Samples were cut into 4-mm sections, formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The phosphoERK protein was analyzed immunohistochemically (monoclonal
antibody clone 20G11; Cell Signaling Technology). Epidermal
keratinocytes were used as an internal positive control. A quickscore
method (15) for immunohistochemical semiquantitation based
on both the intensity and the proportion of brown stained nuclei
was deﬁned for each sample. The percentage of tumor cells staining
positively throughout the section was termed score A and was
assigned scores of 1 to 6 (1 ¼ 0%–4%; 2 ¼ 5%–19%; 3 ¼ 20%–
39%; 4 ¼ 40%–59%; 5 ¼ 60%–79%; 6 ¼ 80%–100%). The whole
section was scanned at low power to gauge the general level of
intensity throughout the section. The average intensity, corresponding to negative, weak, intermediate, and strong staining, was
allocated a score of 0 to 3, respectively, and termed score B.

BRAF–CRAF Heterodimers in BRAF Inhibitor-Treated Tumors

Proximity ligation assay
Cells were grown on glass cover slips, treated with DMSO or
vemurafenib, ﬁxed with methanol or PFA 4%, and permeabilized
with acetone or PBS-Tween 0.2%. The BRAF–CRAF interaction
was detected by proximity ligation assay (PLA) on cell lines in vitro
after treatment with vemurafenib (6 mmol/L, 24 hours) or DMSO.
For PLA on ﬁxed tissue samples, following dewaxing and
rehydration of tissue sections, antigen retrieval was performed
by heating the slides for 30 minutes at 95 C in Tris-EDTA buffer,
pH 9. The tissue sections and cell lines were then treated according
to the manufacturer's instructions (Olink Biosciences) using BRAF
(F7) and CRAF (C12) antibodies, with incubation at 4 C overnight. PLA minus and PLA plus probes were added and incubated
for 1 hour at 37 C. Further oligonucleotides were added, and
allowed to hybridize to the PLA probes, and a ligase joined the two
hybridized oligonucleotides. The circular DNA was then ampliﬁed. The amplicons were detected using the "Brigthﬁeld detection
kit" for the chromogenic revelation or the "Far Red detection kit"
for the ﬂuorescence revelation. The links were visualized by
confocal microscopy (SPE, Leica) or a scanner (Olympus VS120).
The BRAF–CRAF PLA was scored in a semiquantitative fashion
incorporating both the number and the distribution of speciﬁc
visualized dimers in tumor cells. The evaluations were recorded in
each of the ﬁve intensity categories denoted as zero (no staining),
1 (weak but detectable), 2 (mildly distinct), 3 (moderately distinct), and 4 (strong).

Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis used was a nonparametric test to compare two unmatched groups (Mann-Whitney) or more than two
(Anova one-way).

Results
Patients and tumors
Seventy-three tumors originating from 31 patients that had
emerged or progressed signiﬁcantly during treatment with vemurafenib (N ¼ 28) or dabrafenib (N ¼ 3) between 2010 and 2014,
were studied (Supplementary Table S1). The majority of these
tumors (79.4%) were the classic types of skin tumors observed in
the context of BRAF inhibitor treatment: 36 verrucous papillomas
and 22 KA or cutaneous SCCs. However, 15 tumors were more
atypical. Five tumors were de novo melanomas, which have also
been reported during the course of BRAF inhibitor treatment but
much less frequently than squamous keratinocytic tumors (17,
18). Two were congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN) that had
undergone atypical transformation under treatment (patients
#2 and #30, Fig. 1D–F). One patient had three basal cell carcinomas. Three patients had mucosal carcinomas: one vulvar
(patient #32), one gingival (patient #23), and one lingual SCC
(patient #33, Fig. 1A–C). One patient had an urothelial carcinoma
(patient #20), and one patient rapidly developed a regional
lymphatic metastasis from a previously excised cutaneous SCC

(patient #6). The majority of these tumors were not present before
treatment with BRAF inhibitors. A precursor benign lesion, in the
form of a congenital melanocytic nevus (patients #2 and #30),
was already present in 2 patients before treatment initiation. There
was a pre-existing lesion in 2 other patients. The ﬁrst patient had a
12 mm urothelial nodular lesion that was present on the initial CT
scan but that had rapidly progressed (26 mm) under anti-BRAF
therapy after 7 weeks of therapy (patient #20, Fig. 1G–I), and the
second patient had an aggressive lymph node relapse of a previously treated cutaneous SCC of the lip that had been considered at
low risk for relapse (patient #6, Fig. 1J–M).
Genotyping of the tumors
The mutations revealed in each sample are reported in Supplementary Table S1. Oncogenic RAS mutations were found in
58% of the samples from patients treated with a BRAF inhibitor
(38/66) and in 49% of the control tumors (no BRAF inhibitor; 30/
62). They were present in verrucous papillomas (59% and 69%)
and KA/SCC (62% and 33%) in patients with and without BRAF
inhibitor treatment, respectively. An NRASQ61 mutation was
found in 2 of 5 of the secondary melanomas that were evaluable
for DNA sequencing, including one of the 2 transformed CMN.
NRAS mutations were present in 4 of 7 (57%) of the CMN from
patients who had not received any a BRAF inhibitor. A KRASG12V
mutation was found in the urothelial carcinoma and a HRASG13V
mutation was found in the vulvar carcinoma, both carcinomas
induced by vemurafenib. Two of the 10 urothelial carcinomas
used as controls harbored a RAS mutation, but no RAS mutation
was found among the 10 control vulvar carcinomas. The lingual
SCC also harbored a HRASG12S mutation. NF1 mutations were
found in 2 verrucous papillomas and in one SCC. PTEN deletions
were found in 3% of the verrucous papillomas, whereas CDKN2A
mutations were found in 5% of the KA/SCC in anti–BRAF-treated
patients. Patient #6 carried a germline CDKN2AH66fs mutation
that was logically found in the lymph node recurrence (from a
formerly excised lip SCC) that had progressed rapidly under
treatment. Interestingly, this patient developed multiple eruptive
cutaneous SCC under vemurafenib, as shown in Fig. 1L.
ERK phosphorylation in tumor samples
To explore the activation of the MAPK pathway, we searched for
ERK phosphorylation in the patients' samples. Among the tumors
excised from patients treated with a BRAF inhibitor evaluable for
phospho-ERK immunostaining, there were: 28 papillomas, 6 KA,
3 BCC, 9 SCC, 4 SSM, 1 transformed naevus, and 1 urothelial
carcinoma. High phosphorylation of ERK was observed (Supplementary Table S1). Only the three basal cell carcinomas had low
levels of ERK phosphorylation. In control tumors from patients
who had not been treated with BRAF inhibitors, the level of
phosphorylated ERK was also high and was not signiﬁcantly
different from that observed in tumors from patients under
anti-BRAF treatment (Fig. 2).

(Continued.) B, BRAF–CRAF dimerization visualized in three different tumor types. Each purple dot represents a BRAF–CRAF heterodimer. KAs without (top left, PLA

picture, PLA score 4) compared with that of a BRAF inhibitor-free vulvar SCC (bottom left picture, PLA score 1) from two distinct patients. C, BRAF–CRAF

As the paradoxical activating effect of anti-BRAF treatment on
the MAPK pathway is thought to be related to RAF protein
dimerization, we searched for BRAF–CRAF heterodimerization
using a sensitive PLA. We tested 2 NRAS mutant cell lines and one
NF1-mutated Schwann cell line exposed or not to vemurafenib.
This assay generates a signal when the two target proteins,
recognized by two antibodies, are in close proximity (Supplementary Fig. S1). We indeed observed the induction of BRAF–
CRAF heterodimer formation (Fig. 3A) associated with increased
phosphorylated ERK in vemurafenib-treated cells (Fig. 3B and C).
This induction of ERK phosphorylation was impaired when
melanoma cell lines were exposed to vemurafenib in combination with a MEK inhibitor (e.g., trametinib or PD 0325901;
Fig. 3B). As one might expect, MEK inhibition did not block
BRAF–CRAF heterodimerization in vitro since the dimer formation is presumably upstream MEK (Supplementary Fig. S2).
The PLA was then performed for the ﬁrst time on formalin-ﬁxed
parafﬁn-embedded tissue. In normal skin, BRAF–CRAF complexes were not increased in patients under anti-BRAF therapy
compared with normal control skin (Fig. 4A). The number of
BRAF-CRAF dimers was signiﬁcantly higher in BRAF inhibitorinduced tumors compared with the same types of tumors in
untreated patients (Fig. 4A). This was true for keratinocytic
tumors but also for all other tumor types (Fig. 4A). BRAF–CRAF
heterodimers were also visualized at high levels in the mucosal
and melanocytic tumors (Fig. 4B) from the patient with the vulvar
SCC (patient #32), in one of KA (patient #27) and in one of the
transformed CMN (patient #2) exhibiting a particularly high level
of BRAF–CRAF dimers under BRAF inhibitor treatment. In this last
lesion, the dimers were more abundant in the more atypical part
of the lesion compared with that seen in another nevus excised
from the same patient before treatment. To evaluate the association between RAS mutations and BRAF–CRAF heterodimers, we
differentially analyzed the BRAF–CRAF PLA score in RAS-mutant
and RAS-wt tumors with their BRAF inhibitor-free control series
according to their RAS status. We observed that the BRAF–CRAF
PLA score was signiﬁcantly increased by BRAF inhibitor treatment
independently of the RAS mutational status (Fig. 4C).

Discussion
BRAF inhibitors can, thus, also induce or facilitate the progression of various tumors, apart from the classic keratinocytic tumors
reported to date. Until recently, mostly skin tumors had been
reported, including some new melanomas (17, 18) and none of
them were aggressive or became metastatic. Secondary tumor
initiation was demonstrated to be linked to the paradoxical
activation of the MAPK pathway via activation of CRAF and that
this was facilitated by upstream events such as mutations of RAS
proteins, upstream of BRAF. As RAS protein mutations can be
found in many organs in premalignant tumors such as colon
polyps for example, the emergence of extracutaneous tumors was,
in theory, possible, and the recent report on the worsening of
RASmut leukemia under an anti-BRAF agent was the ﬁrst sign of
this feared event (14).
We indeed observed the emergence of 3 mucosal tumors, 1
genital, and 2 oral lesions that were not present before BRAF
inhibitor therapy as well as rapid progression of a RAS mutant
urothelial carcinoma. In terms of skin tumors, we observed 5 new
melanomas and the transformation of 2 congenital melanocytic

1482 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

nevi. One patient with a CDKN2A germline mutation rapidly
developed an aggressive metastatic relapse from a previously
resected cutaneous SCC, together with the efﬂorescence of cutaneous in situ SCCs. For this last patient, it cannot be deﬁnitely
concluded that BRAF inhibitor therapy was responsible for the
relapse, but this is a reasonable hypothesis as CDKN2A is known
to be a negative regulator of CDK4 and cyclin D1, which also
interferes with the MAPK pathway (19). The three basal cell
carcinomas observed in one patient could be unrelated to BRAF
inhibitor treatment because basal cell carcinomas frequently
occur after 50 years of age.
All the tumors induced or promoted by BRAF inhibitors exhibited a high level of ERK phosphorylation, with RAS mutations in
more than 50% of the cases. A transformed CMN, the vulvar, and
the urothelial carcinomas also harbored a RAS mutation. In 42% of
the tumors occurring in patients treated with a BRAF inhibitor, no
RAS mutations were found. It is possible that other unscreened
mutations, also activating the MAPK pathway, could be involved.
Such was the case, for example, in three tumors that were found to
harbor an NF1-inactivating mutation known to activate the NRAS
protein (20, 21). In cell lines harboring RAS-activating mutations or
NF1 loss of function, we observed the paradoxical activation of the
MAPK pathway with ERK phosphorylation being increased by
vemurafenib. This activation was associated with the increased
formation of BRAF–CRAF heterodimers and was decreased when
vemurafenib was associated with a MEK inhibitor. This is in
accordance with a much lower incidence of SCC/KA, observed in
less than 5% of the patients treated with such combinations (22–
24). To potently inhibit mutant BRAF cells without inducing any
paradoxical activation, anti-MEK agents or pan-RAF inhibitors
called "paradox-breakers," such as PLX7904, are also being developed (25–27).
From now on, most of the patients with metastatic melanoma
harboring a BRAFV600 mutation are going to be treated with a
combination of anti-BRAF and anti-MEK agents. However, the
addition of MEK inhibitor in vivo signiﬁcantly decreases but does
not entirely abrogate the risk of BRAF inhibitor-mediated oncogenesis. This is illustrated by the recent report on the progression
of a presumably dormant KRASmut metastatic colon cancer in a
patient receiving the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib
(28). In addition, vemurafenib as a single agent is currently being
evaluated in several other BRAF-mutant tumor types as well as in
the adjuvant setting, in patients having undergone a complete
resection of melanoma lymph node metastases. The risk of
inducing internal tumors raises a safety issue in this patient
population, especially because 50% of them are not going to
develop a recurrence of their melanoma.
It is, thus, of critical importance to be aware that various types of
tumors can occur, and if possible, to be capable of identifying
patients who might be at higher risk of developing them. For
example, CMN commonly observed in about 1% to 6% of
newborns (29) frequently harbor NRAS mutations (50%–80%
for the largest lesions). The highest degree of caution is, thus,
recommended before initiating anti-BRAFV600 therapies in
patients presenting with this type of benign lesion because of
the major risk of transformation. RAS mutations also occur other
premalignant congenital or acquired premalignant lesions like
nevus sebaceus or colon polyps for respective examples (30, 31).
In rare genetic backgrounds like the Costello syndrome with
constitutional activation of a RAS protein the risk of developing
a secondary tumor is also substantial.

BRAF–CRAF Heterodimers in BRAF Inhibitor-Treated Tumors

The physical proximity between BRAF and CRAF could be
visualized in our patients' tumor samples. The rate of dimers was
signiﬁcantly increased by BRAF inhibitors both in the RASmut and
RASwt secondary tumors. Of note with the sequencing method
used here, the detection of RAS ampliﬁcations among the RASwt
secondary tumors was not possible. We found that BRAF–CRAF
dimers were low in the three basal cell carcinomas, suggesting that
they might not be linked to the treatment. Neither the level of RAS
mutations, nor ERK phosphorylation could help differentiate
between a BRAF inhibitor-induced tumor and a tumor unrelated
to this treatment. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that the level of BRAF/
CRAF dimerization is the only biomarker signiﬁcantly associated
with BRAF inhibitors–induced oncogenesis in both cutaneous
and extracutaneous tumors. The combination of anti-BRAF with
anti-MEK, the standard of care for patients with BRAF-mutant
metastatic melanoma, signiﬁcantly decreases the risk of iatrogenic
tumors. However, this risk is not totally abrogated by the addition
of an anti-MEK agent. Furthermore, because anti-BRAF monotherapy is still presently evaluated in several other tumor types as
well as in the adjuvant setting in patients with high risk of
melanoma relapse, it is critical to be aware that the spectrum of
iatrogenic tumors is wider than the one previously reported.
