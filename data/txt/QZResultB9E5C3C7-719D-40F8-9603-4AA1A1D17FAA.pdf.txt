Abstract

Author Manuscript

Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable malignancy due, in part, to the influence of the
bone marrow microenvironment on survival and drug response. Identification of
microenvironment-specific survival signaling determinants is critical for the rational design of
therapy and elimination of MM. Previously, we have shown that collaborative signaling between
β1 integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin and interleukin-6 confers a more malignant
phenotype via amplification of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)
activation. Further characterization of the events modulated under these conditions with
quantitative phosphotyrosine profiling identified 193 differentially phosphorylated peptides.
Seventy-seven phosphorylations were upregulated upon adhesion, including PYK2/FAK2,
Paxillin, CASL and p130CAS consistent with focal adhesion (FA) formation. We hypothesized
that the collaborative signaling between β1 integrin and gp130 (IL-6 beta receptor, IL-6 signal
transducer) was mediated by FA formation and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) activity.
Both pharmacological and molecular targeting of PYK2 attenuated the amplification of STAT3
phosphorylation under co-stimulatory conditions. Co-culture of MM cells with patient bone
marrow stromal cells (BMSC) showed similar β1 integrin-specific enhancement of PYK2 and

STAT3 signaling. Molecular and pharmacological targeting of PYK2 specifically induced cell
death and reduced clonogenic growth in BMSC-adherent myeloma cell lines, aldehyde
dehydrogenase-positive MM cancer stem cells and patient specimens. Finally, PYK2 inhibition
similarly attenuated MM progression in vivo. These data identify a novel PYK2-mediated survival
pathway in MM cells and MM cancer stem cells within the context of microenvironmental cues,
providing preclinical support for the use of the clinical stage FAK/PYK2 inhibitors for treatment
of MM, especially in a minimal residual disease setting.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Multiple myeloma (MM) remains a mortal disease of bone marrow resident malignant
plasma cells characterized by classical hallmarks of end organ damage.1–3 Nearly all
myeloma patients succumb to the disease due to the existence of a population of tumor cells
that evade initial therapy, contributing to minimal residual disease (MRD), and subsequent
relapse of drug-resistant tumor cells.4,5 MRD results, in part, from the survival signaling
afforded adherent myeloma cells by complex cues from soluble and physical determinants of
the bone marrow microenvironment. This hypothesis has identified mechanisms of
environment-mediated drug resistance and survival signaling as critical considerations in
drug discovery and therapeutic design in myeloma and other hematologic malignancies.6–10

Author Manuscript

The successful development of therapeutics targeting environment-mediated survival
signaling (and environment-mediated drug resistance) requires preclinical models that
account for the tumor and the tumor microenvironment (TME). We, and others, have
demonstrated that (1) myeloma cell survival and drug resistance imparted by cellular
adhesion is dynamic and environment dependent; (2) altered drug response is dominated by
post-translational events; and (3) novel signaling networks and survival pathways are elicited
under co-stimulatory conditions (soluble and physical components) that would not be
identified in models without TME cues.2,11–13 These data reveal inherent limitations in cell
culture models of drug discovery that do not account for multiple stimuli from the TME.
Within the bone marrow microenvironment, myeloma survival and resistance to therapy
likely involves the ‘collaboration’ between dynamic soluble and physical effectors of the
TME,2,12,14 providing a differential selective advantage.

Author Manuscript

To investigate signaling modulated by the TME, we utilized a reductionist approach,
reconstructing the complexity of the bone marrow microenvironment from a model of
adhesion to fibronectin (FN) or exposure to interleukin-6 (IL-6) as separate representative
physical and soluble microenvironment determinants to a combined model examining the
intracellular signaling and biological sequelae following exposure of FN-adhered myeloma
cells to IL-6.2 With this model, we previously demonstrated that IL-6 and FN-adhesion
collaborated via post-translational alterations of the IL-6 receptor signaling complex to
enhance signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activity and a more
malignant phenotype.2 β1 integrin-mediated adhesion to FN altered phosphorylation events
from gp130 (IL-6 beta receptor, IL-6 signal transducer). Together, these data suggested that
FN-adhesion modulates signaling from gp130, accounting for the subsequent phenotype.

Therefore, we wanted to further investigate signaling events induced by FN-adhesion
combined with IL-6.
To address this question, we surveyed the intracellular signaling induced by FN/IL-6
collaborative signaling by combining phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation with liquid
chromatography– tandem mass spectrometry to examine the tyrosine phos-phoproteome in
the FN/IL-6-model of the TME.15–17 From these data, we hypothesized that focal adhesion
formation and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), a kinase recently linked with myeloma
progression,18 is critical for the enhanced JAK1/STAT3 activation observed under costimulatory conditions. Within this report, we demonstrate that PYK2 is positioned upstream
of JAK1/STAT3 signaling and is a critical mediator of a novel myeloma cell survival
pathway activated in the context of co-stimulation within multiple models of the TME and in
vivo; as such, PYK2 represents a viable anti-myeloma target.

β1 integrin preferentially amplifies JAK and STAT3 phosphorylation following IL-6 ligation
in myeloma cell lines and patient specimens We have previously demonstrated that
stimulation of FN-adherent myeloma cells with IL-6 facilitated a β1 integrin-dependent
enhancement of STAT3 activation.2 Further characterization of the signaling in costimulated cells demonstrated a preferential phosphorylation of both Janus kinase 1 (JAK1)
and STAT3 in myeloma cell lines and patient specimens (Figure 1a and b). Quantification of
STAT3 phosphorylation in patient specimens using flow cytometry method (FCM)
confirmed the western blot data in six of seven CD138-selected specimens examined by
FCM and seven of eight samples including western blot analysis (Figure 1c), or 87.5% of
patient samples. Interestingly, FCM data suggest that adhesion to FN may enhance STAT3
phosphorylation by lowering the threshold of its activation, increasing the number of
responding cells. In characterizing other signaling effectors of IL-6, we demonstrated that
the co-stimulatory phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT3 was specific. Both AKT and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation were not increased
under the same conditions (Figure 1d and e). To confirm β1 integrin involvement, we
demonstrated that enhanced JAK1 and STAT3 phosphorylation was abrogated following
knockdown of β1 integrin in myeloma cell lines with RNA interference (RNAi; Figure 1f
and g).2 Together, these data demonstrated that cellular adhesion to FN acutely alters the
signaling dynamics elicited by IL-6, suggestive of larger scale alterations in the
phosphoproteome under adherent conditions.

Characterization of the tyrosine phosphoproteome induced by adhesion to fibronectin and
identification of PYK2 phosphorylation in adhered myeloma cells
To characterize downstream signaling events induced by FN adhesion or IL-6 alone, as well
as collaborative signaling between FN and IL-6, phosphotyrosine proteomic profiling was
used to compare cells in suspension (Sus), Sus+IL-6, FN-adhesion and FN+IL-6. Relative
quantification identified 193 unique phospho-peptides across four conditions that
demonstrated consistency in magnitude and direction of phosphorylation between duplicate
samples. Hierarchical cluster analysis of the phosphopeptide heat map revealed four unique

groups of phosphorylation events correlating with the four experimental conditions. Of
these, 152 phosphorylation events were specific to adhesion (Figure 2a–d). These
phosphopeptides corresponded to proteins participating in signal transduction, cellular
adhesion/cytoskeletal assembly, RNA processing, transcriptional regulation, metabolism,
cell cycle and vesicle trafficking (Supplementary Table 1). Because our previous results
demonstrated that FN-adhesion-specific events facilitated STAT3 recruitment to gp130 and
enhanced STAT3 activation,2 we initially focused on FN-adhesion-specific phosphorylation
events. Enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation (8.7-fold increased phosphorylation in costimulated cells vs IL-6 alone) and decreased ERK1 (MK03) phosphorylation (0.43-fold in
co-stimulated cells vs IL-6 alone) was observed within the phosphoproteomic data set
providing further validation of this methodology consistent with our western blot results
(Figure 1a, b, d and e).2

Examination of the list of tyrosine phosphorylation events positively regulated by adhesion
to FN-identified phosphorylation events consistent with focal adhesion formation including
paxillin (pY118), BCAR1/p130CAS (pY128 and pY249), CASL/NEDD9 (pY166), β-actin
(pY166), tubulin 1α (pY357), as well as the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) FAK2/PYK2
(pY580). Quantification of peptide phosphorylation relative to myeloma cells in Sus
demonstrated the greatest increase in pY580 of PYK2 compared with all other peptides,
suggesting that PYK2 may be a central component in FA signaling in myeloma cells
(Supplementary Table 2). PYK2 autophosphorylation (pY402) following adhesion to FN
was validated by western blot analysis (Figure 3a and b) because sequences around this
residue are not amenable to analysis by tryptic digestion. In addition to 77 upregulated FNspecific phosphorylation events, levels of 75 phosphorylated peptides were also negatively
regulated upon FN adhesion, 20 phosphorylation sites were specifically modulated by IL-6
stimulation alone and 21 were unique to co-stimulation conditions (Figure 2a–d;
Supplementary Figure 1A–D with peptide sequences). These data suggest that FN adhesion
stimulates novel signaling events linking focal adhesions and cytokine signaling in myeloma
cells. Our phosphotyrosine proteomic screen also suggests that focal adhesion formation and
activation of PYK2 may be a critical step in the unique and complex signaling events
observed in the context of the TME.
PYK2 is an upstream mediator of the enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation observed under
co-stimulatory conditions

Author Manuscript

PYK2 is a FAK family protein19,20 previously identified in myeloma cells and has been
linked to MM progression.18,21–23 Our phosphoproteomic analysis suggests PYK2 is well
suited to modulate cross talk between soluble and physical effectors (activated focal
adhesions) in the bone marrow niche. In support of this, PYK2 signaling has been linked to
cell surface receptor signaling.24–28 In Figure 3a and b, we validated that PYK2 is
phosphorylated upon adhesion to FN in all myeloma cell lines and CD138-selected patient
myeloma cells examined. We hypothesized that adhesion-induced PYK2 activation
contributes to enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation. Treatment of RPMI8226 or NCIH929
myeloma cells with PYK2 RNAi attenuated the enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation induced
under collaborative conditions (Figure 3c and d). This treatment did not affect the low levels
of STAT3 phosphorylation induced by IL-6 alone. PYK2 RNAi did not affect the expression

of other IL-6 signaling complex proteins or β1 integrin expression (data not shown). Similar
results are demonstrated with the FAK/PYK2 kinase inhibitor VS-6062 (Figure 3e and f).
Molecular targeting of PYK2 did not significantly attenuate adhesion of RPMI8226 or
NCIH929 cells to FN (data not shown; P > 0.05). These results indicate that PYK2 is a key
upstream determinant in the enhanced STAT3 signaling linking β1 integrin-mediated
adhesion and gp130.

DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR, DEPDC6) is a negative
regulator of the mTOR pathway, causing reduced cell growth and proliferation. DEPTOR is
overexpressed in myeloma with increased c-maf expression and reduced expression of
DEPTOR in myeloma cells leads to apoptosis.29 We show for the first time that DEPTOR
protein (Figure 3g) and RNA (data not shown) expression is induced by FN-mediated
adhesion and IL-6 stimulation. Moreover, pretreatment of myeloma cells with STAT3 or
PYK2 RNAi attenuated co-stimulation induced DEPTOR expression. These data suggest
that DEPTOR represents a novel downstream effector of PYK2 and STAT3 signaling under
co-stimulatory conditions.
PYK2 modulates STAT3 phosphorylation in myeloma cells upon adhesion to patient
BMSCs

Author Manuscript

We next wanted to determine whether PYK2 and subsequent signaling translated to more
complex and more biologically relevant models of the TME. Myeloma cells were examined
under three conditions: cells incubated in (1) monoculture (M, myeloma cells alone), (2) coculture with patient bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) separated by a transwell membrane
(Tw; providing only soluble factors from the TME) and (3) co-culture with patient BMSCs
with direct adhesion (Cx; both physical and soluble components; Figure 4a). Within this
more biologically complex model, we demonstrate that PYK2, JAK1 and STAT3
phosphorylation were enhanced in only myeloma cells co-cultured under adherent
conditions in all cell lines examined (Figure 4b and c). Increased PYK2, JAK1 and STAT3
phosphorylation was observed in RPMI8226 cells upon adhesion to all patient BMSCs
utilized (Supplementary Figure 2A; three individual patient BMSCs). Similar to the FN/IL-6
model, STAT3 phosphorylation was preferential, occurring at the exclusion of AKT and
ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure 2B). Preferential PYK2, JAK1 and STAT3
phosphorylation is similarly observed in patient myeloma cells upon adhesion to BMSCs,
but not in conditions without direct contact (Figure 4d and e).

Author Manuscript

We examined the role of β1 integrin and the IL-6 signal transducer, gp130, in the
amplification of STAT3 phosphorylation in myeloma cells adhered to BMSCs. The
activation of PYK2 under co-culture conditions was dependent upon β1 integrin-mediated
adhesion to BMSCs, as incubation of RPMI8226 and OPM2 myeloma cell lines with β1
integrin small interfering RNA attenuated co-culture-associated PYK2 phosphorylation
(Figure 4f and g). Of note, increased β1 integrin expression was seen in myeloma cells under
co-culture conditions. BMSC-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in myeloma cells was also
decreased by gp130 knockdown (Supplementary Figure 2C). Taken together, these data
indicate that β1 integrin/gp130 cross talk is responsible, at least in part, for enhanced STAT3
signaling observed in myeloma cells adhered to BMSC. Importantly, STAT3 and PYK2

phosphorylation was not induced in the BMSCs under these co-cultured conditions,
demonstrating myeloma cell-specific phosphorylation of PYK2 and STAT3 under cocultured conditions (Supplementary Figure 3). Furthermore, treatment of RPMI8226 and
OPM2 myeloma cells with the FAK/PYK2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) VS-6062
decreased PYK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation induced by co-stimulatory conditions (Figure
5a and b). These data further demonstrate a novel β1 integrin-dependent PYK2/STAT3
signaling pathway under collaborative signaling between soluble and physical effectors of
the TME.
PYK2 regulates myeloma cell survival under adherent co-culture conditions

Author Manuscript

We demonstrated that targeting PYK2 with VS-6062 or RNAi attenuated STAT3 signaling,
placing PYK2 upstream of STAT3 signaling under co-stimulatory conditions. Therefore, we
next determined the consequences of targeting PYK2 on myeloma survival. Incubation of
myeloma cells with nanomolar concentrations of VS-6062 induced co-culture-specific cell
death as quantified by annexin V surface expression and caspase-3 activation by FCM in
RPMI8226 (Figure 5c and d) and OPM2 (Figure 5e and f) myeloma cell lines. To address
the possibility that VS-6062 might be toxic to BMSC through inhibition of FAK/PYK2
signaling, we demonstrated that the TKI does not impact the viability of BMSCs at
concentrations up to 10 μM, several-fold higher than concentrations needed to induce
myeloma cell death (data not shown).

Author Manuscript

Even with highly specific pharmacologic kinase inhibitors, TKIs can have off-target effects.
Furthermore, under co-culture conditions, we cannot state that VS-6062 is targeting only
myeloma cells. To address these issues, we utilized clinically relevant antisense
oligonucleotides (ASOs). Myeloma cell lines and patient specimens were treated with ASOs
targeting STAT3 (AZD9150), PYK2, as well as the combination for 48 h prior to incubation
in the three culture conditions. Targeting this pathway with ASO similarly induced apoptosis
only in myeloma cells incubated under co-stimulatory conditions as quantified by FCM
(Figure 5g–j). STAT3 ASO (AZD9150)-induced Annexin V-positive cells in RPMI8226
cells (P = 0.02) and trended toward increased apoptosis of OPM2 cells (P = 0.061). PYK2
ASO-induced statistically significant Annexin V staining in both RPMI8226 and OPM2
myeloma cell lines (P = 0.006 and 0.001, respectively), as well as a patient specimen (P =
0.02). Consistent with our data placing PYK2 upstream of JAK/STAT3 signaling, the
combined knockdown of PYK2 and STAT3 did not afford a statistically significant increase
in myeloma cell death above that of PYK2 alone. Background apoptosis observed in control
cells adhered to BMSCs (Cx) did not impact the significance of apoptosis measured in
experimental groups and is likely an artifact resulting from myeloma-BMSC separation just
prior to staining. These results provide evidence that the collaboration of BMSC adhesion
and soluble determinants modulate PYK2-dependent myeloma cell survival.
To further assess the impact of PYK2 inhibition on myeloma cell survival, we employed the
clinically relevant FAK/PYK2 inhibitor, VS-6063 (defactinib, Verastem, Inc., Cambridge,
MA, USA) currently being evaluated in phase I and II clinical trials (NCT01870609,
NCT01778803, NCT01951690 and NCT02004028). Phosphorylation of PYK2 in myeloma
cell lines (Figure 6a) and myeloma patient specimens (Figure 6b) adhered to BMSCs could

be blocked using nanomolar concentrations of inhibitor (Figure 6a and b), replicating results
observed with VS-6062. To assess the effects of VS-6063 on survival of both myeloma cell
lines and patient specimens, we employed colony formation assays. Consistent with an
increased survival advantage in the context of BMSC, this assay demonstrated increased
MM cell clonogenic survival in the presence of BMSCs (Figure 6c and d). Inhibition of
PYK2 with VS-6063 preferentially inhibited clonogenic growth of RPMI8226, NCIH929
and patient MM cells grown in co-culture relative to cells grown in the absence of BMSCs
(Figure 6e and f).

Author Manuscript

MRD has also been attributed to a small population of putative cancer stem cells with selfrenewal properties and the ability to propagate disease in myeloma and other
malignancies.30–32 To further investigate the potential of targeting PYK2 in other aspects of
MRD, we examined the effect of the TME on myeloma progenitor cells defined as aldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH +)-positive myeloma cells.31,33 Within this context, the percentage
of ALDH+ myeloma cells increased in the presence of BMSCs (Figure 6g), suggesting that
this population of cells is also influenced by the TME. Importantly, ALDH+ myeloma
cancer stem cells co-cultured with BMSCs also demonstrated increased sensitivity to
treatment with the PYK2 inhibitor VS-6063 relative to ALDH+ cells cultured without
BMSC (Figure 6h). Together, these data further affirm the role of PYK2 in TME-mediated
MM cell survival and that targeting PYK2 represents a therapeutic strategy to overcome the
protective effects of the TME and its potential contribution to multiple aspects of MRD.

Author Manuscript

Finally, we wanted to examine the role of PYK2 in an in vivo model of the TME. As in
human myeloma cells, PYK2 TKI attenuated PYK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation and
induced apoptosis in 5TGM1 murine myeloma cells cultured in direct contact with
M2-10B4 murine BMSCs (Figure 7a and b). Employing the immune competent 5TGM1C57BL/KaLwRijHsd murine model, we demonstrated that PYK2 TKI activity was effective
in an in vivo model of the myeloma TME. One million luciferase-expressing 5TGM1 cells
were tail-vein injected into six mice per condition. Oral administration of the VS-4718
PYK2/FAK TKI twice daily significantly reduced murine myeloma disease burden as
quantified by immunoglobulin G2b levels and luciferase activity (Figure 7c and d; P = 0.03
and 0.02, respectively). Furthermore, PYK2 inhibition with VS-4718 also afforded a
statistically significant overall survival advantage to treated mice relative to vehicle control
(Figure 7e, P = 0.018). Collectively, our results demonstrate that PYK2 signaling is critical
for myeloma cell survival in the context on the TME.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

The high mortality observed in MM is, in part, the consequence of MRD afforded by
complex signaling events in the TME and putative MM cancer stem cells. We and others
have previously demonstrated myeloma cells co-cultured in contact with BMSCs were
afforded a survival advantage compared with cells co-cultured without contact.12,13,34 This
experience demonstrates that the combination of soluble and physical effectors provides a
selective advantage, suggesting microenvironment-specific heterogeneity in survival
signaling conferred by the TME. Therefore, it is critical to identify microenvironmentspecific survival pathways and drug targets.

We have previously shown that when myeloma cells are adhered to fibronectin, STAT3
phosphorylation is enhanced in response to IL-6 stimulation, leading to a more aggressive
tumor phenotype.2 In the present work, we have extended those findings by identifying a
novel molecular intermediate of gp130 and integrin cooperative signaling using
phosphoproteomic screening of a preclinical TME model. Specifically, we identified the
FAK PYK2 as the central figure in the unique signaling events modulated by the
collaborative signaling between the soluble and physical effectors of the TME. Enhanced
JAK/STAT3 phosphorylation was observed under cooperative signaling between receptors of
soluble factors and adhesion in both the reductionist (FN/IL-6) and more clinically relevant
patient BMSC co-stimulatory models of the TME. We demonstrate that this enhanced
signaling is dependent on upstream activation of the FAK, PYK2. Critically, targeting PYK2
with pharmacologic and molecular techniques preferentially induces death and attenuates
clonogenic growth in myeloma cells under co-stimulatory conditions. Attenuation of PYK2
also had disease-modifying effects in the 5TGM1 murine model. These results indicate that
under co-stimulatory conditions, myeloma cells and myeloma stem cells require PYK2 for
survival. As such, these data illustrate the potential of PYK2 as a novel TME-specific target
to combat myeloma and MRD by disrupting the survival pathways resulting from the
complex network of environmental cues in the bone marrow microenvironment.

Author Manuscript

PYK2 expression has been shown to correlate with myeloma disease progression.18 Our
results indicate that adhesion-dependent PYK2 activation modulates myeloma cell survival,
at least in part, via enhanced JAK/STAT signaling. This conclusion is consistent with
previous findings linking PYK2 to JAK-dependent Type I and Type II cytokine
signaling.25–28 This work is novel because it is the first description of a downstream PYK2mediated STAT3 activation mechanism associated with these receptor families. The
involvement of PYK2 in JAK-dependent receptor signaling is interesting because PYK2 and
FAK1 are one of only two families of tyrosine kinases to contain FERM (4.1, ezrin, radixin
and moesin) protein-binding domains.20 The other group of kinases is the JAK family that
imparts kinase activity to gp130 and other cytokine receptors. These facts suggest that PYK2
is well suited to modulate cross talk between gp130 and β1 integrin-activated focal
adhesions via direct contact. We anticipate that it will be critical to further examine the
biochemical relationship between JAK and PYK2 under co-stimulatory conditions.

Author Manuscript

We also identified DEPTOR as a downstream effector of PYK2 and STAT3 signaling in our
model system. DEPTOR is an inhibitor of TORC1 signaling linked to myeloma survival29
and its role in survival in this system will be an active component of future studies.
Furthermore, our work does not exclude the influence of additional PYK2-modulated
signaling pathways induced by BMSCs on myeloma cell survival. Our ASO data provide
evidence that PYK2-specific, yet STAT3-independent events, may contribute to myeloma
cell survival upon interacting with the TME. PYK2 has also been shown to negatively
regulate osteoblast differentiation and activity in mice,35 suggesting that PYK2 may
negatively influence WNT/β-catenin, osterix and RUNX2 signaling.23,36 Furthermore,
adhesion-mediated PYK2 activity may also influence signaling from additional upstream
receptors. PYK2 has been linked to STAT3 signal amplification through the receptor
tyrosine kinase, epidermal growth factor receptor.24 Furthermore, PYK2 also associates with
the receptors FGFR3 and c-MET.37,38 These results indicate that adhesion-mediated

activation of PYK2 may modulate signaling events from multiple soluble receptors critical
to myeloma survival in the TME, thus, making PYK2 a more attractive therapeutic target.

Author Manuscript

Our examination of the tyrosine phosphoproteome initially identified PYK2 as a candidate
intermediate of FN/IL-6 cooperative signaling. In addition, these data highlight other
important signaling cross talk downstream of IL-6 receptor and adhesion receptors. We
identified 193 differentially modified tyrosine phosphopeptides in myeloma cells.
Phosphopeptide heat map analysis revealed four unique groupings of phosphorylation events
correlating with the experimental conditions. These phosphopeptides corresponded to
proteins participating in numerous cellular functions including cytoskeletal/adhesion and
signal transduction, as well as cellular metabolism, RNA processing and cell cycle
(Supplementary Table 1). Further investigation is needed into the potential role of TMEregulated RNA processing and metabolism intermediates as alternate/additional antimyeloma targets. In addition to the 152 differentially regulated peptides identified following
adhesion alone, 21 phosphopeptides were demonstrated to be specific to co-stimulation (FN/
IL-6), including the phosphatases SHIP1 and SHP2. Fuhler et al. have demonstrated a role
of phosphatases in myeloma survival and drug resistance, suggesting that they too may be
critical mediators of the survival signaling induced under co-stimulatory conditions.39,40

Author Manuscript

This work is significant because it is the first report linking PYK2 to the amplification of
STAT3 signaling in the context of TME-specific myeloma survival.41 We identify PYK2 as a
novel TME-specific target to potentially combat MRD by disrupting the unique survival
pathways resulting from the complex network of environmental cues of the TME in
myeloma cells, in putative myeloma cancer stem cells, and in vivo. As such, we provide
preclinical evidence and rationale supporting the clinical use of FAK/PYK2 inhibitors, such
as VS-6063, for the treatment of MM, ideally in the setting of MRD. Finally, the TME has
been linked to survival and drug response in diverse tumors42–47 Therefore, PYK2 or other
signaling factors identified in our phosphoproteomic analysis may have broad application for
survival of a spectrum of malignancies in the context of the TME.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
All cell lines were grown as previously published,2 and are routinely tested for mycoplasma
contamination and κ/λ expression. Cell lines were authenticated using short tandem repeat
DNA typing according to ATCC guidelines using the GenePrint 10 System (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA).48

Primary tumor specimens were harvested from bone marrow by aspiration and purified by
positive selection versus an anti-CD138 affinity column (Miltenyi, Auburn, CA, USA).
Primary patient BMSCs were obtained from the flow-through from CD138-selected marrow
samples. Nonadherent cells were aspirated for 3–4 weeks until a morphologically similar
monolayer of bone marrow fibroblasts cells remained. Specimens were obtained from
myeloma patients enrolled in Moffitt Cancer Center's Total Cancer Care program after
obtaining informed consent. This program is approved by the institutional review board at
the University of South Florida.

RNAi and ASOs

ASO to STAT3 (AZD9150),49 PYK2 and non-specific controls were from Isis
Pharmaceuticals (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Twenty-four to 48 h prior to experiments, ASOs
were added directly to tissue culture medium of cell lines or primary tumor cells at
concentrations of 2.5 μM or 10.0 μM, respectively. Non-silencing control and small
interfering RNA targeting three sequences each of PYK2, β1 integrin and gp130 was
purchased from Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) and transfected into cell lines by
electroporation as previously described.50
Apoptosis assays

Apoptosis was quantified 48 h after treatment with VS-6062, VS-4718 (Verastem, Inc.) or
ASO by FCM using either antibodies directed to activated caspase-3 or annexin surface
expression per manufacturer's directions (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA, USA).
Tumor cell colony formation
Tumor cell colony formation in methylcellulose was used to quantify in vitro clonogenic
growth according to our previously published methods.31,33 Myeloma cells (1000 cells/ml)
were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline following treatment, then plated in
triplicate into 35 mm2 tissue culture dishes containing 1.2% methylcellulose, 30% fetal
bovine serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 10-4 M 2-mercaptoethanol and 2 mM L-glutamine.
For clinical specimens, mononuclear cells were isolated from primary clinical bone marrow
aspirates. Following 10–21 days of culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2, tumor colonies consisting
of more than 40 cells were quantified using an inverted microscope. Drug treatments were
carried out using VS-6063 for 96 h in complete media at the indicated concentrations.

FC and cell isolation
Cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate–conjugated mouse anti-human CD138 or
isotype control antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) for 30 min at 4 °C, then
stained for ALDH activity using the Aldefluor reagent (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver,
BC, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were subsequently washed
in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 μM propidium iodide (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA)
and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA,
USA) or isolated using a FACSAria II cell sorter. Cells were initially gated to exclude
propidium iodide positive cells then analyzed for CD138 or ALDH expression.

Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry phosphoproteomics

Author Manuscript

After phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation at the peptide level according to the
manufacturer's instructions, tryptic phosphopeptides were eluted with 0.15% trifluoroacetic
acid and concentrated to 20 μl using vacuum centrifugation (Speedvac, Thermo, San Jose,
CA, USA). A nanoflow liquid chromatograph (U3000, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
coupled to an electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap, Thermo) was used for
tandem mass spectrometry peptide sequencing experiments for identification and relative
quantification. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate, as previously described.52
5TGM1 myeloma mouse model

Author Manuscript

A total of 1×106 5TGM1 cells were injected into 6- to 8-week-old female C57BL/
KaLwRijHsd mice via tail vein. Beginning at day 14, mice were treated with VS-4718 in
0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich; St Louis, MO, USA) and 0.1% Tween80
(Sigma-Aldrich) at 50 mg/kg twice daily by oral gavage. Immunoglobulin G2b serum levels
were measured by ELISA once a week for 4 weeks per the manufacturer's instructions
(Bethyl, Montgomery, TX, USA). Tumor burden was also measured by luciferase assay
using an IVES-200 imaging system. Mice were monitored daily and euthanized at the onset
of hind-limb paralysis. All procedures were carried out in compliance with the laws,
regulations and guidelines of the National Institutes of Health's Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals and with the approval of the University of South Florida's Animal
Care and Use Committee. Sample size was predetermined using power analysis and mice
were sorted by simple randomization without blinding prior to the experiment.

IL-6 induced JAK1 and STAT3 phosphorylation in myeloma cells is selectively increased by
β1 integrin-mediated adhesion. Myeloma cell lines (a) and patient specimens (b, c) display
amplified JAK1 and STAT3 phosphorylation in response to 1 ng/ml IL-6 when adhered to
the extracellular matrix component fibronectin (FN) compared with cells grown in
suspension (Sus). IL-6 induced STAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 was measured in
seven myeloma patient specimens ex vivo by FCM (c, IL-6 stimulated cells are indicated by
blue tracing). In contrast, activation of other downstream IL-6 signaling pathways, such as
AKT and ERK, is not enhanced by adhesion (d, e). Knockdown of β1 integrin by RNA
interference abolished adhesion-mediated enhancement of JAK1 and STAT3
phosphorylation in IL-6 treated cells (f, g). Cell lines (a, d, f, g) or primary cells (b, c, e)
were grown in Sus or adhered to FN-coated plates (FN) for 1 h prior to stimulation with 1
ng/ml IL-6 for 30 min. Protein phosphorylation was assessed by western blot (a, b, d-g) or

PYK2 mediates the amplification of IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and concomitant
gene expression in adhered myeloma cells. Adhesion of myeloma cell lines (a) or primary
myeloma specimens (b) to the ECM component fibronectin (FN) stimulates PYK2
autophosphorylation at tyrosine 402. Adhesion-mediated amplification of STAT3
phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 is abrogated by blockade of PYK2 protein expression (c, d)
or inhibition of PYK2 kinase activity (e, f). DEPTOR expression in myeloma cells is
induced by FN-mediated adhesion and IL-6 stimulation (g) and inhibition of STAT3 or
PYK2 expression by ASO treatment reduced DEPTOR expression. PYK2 kinase activity
was assessed by monitoring PYK2 autophosphorylation at tyrosine 402. Cells were either
treated with siRNA or ASO 48 h prior to stimulation with IL-6. Cells were grown in
suspension (Sus) or adhered to FN-coated plates (FN) for 1 h prior to stimulation with 1
ng/ml IL-6 for 30 min. VS-6062 was added just before plating. All immunoblots are

Adhesion-mediated amplification of STAT3 phosphorylation in a complex model of the bone
marrow microenvironment requires β1 integrin. Myeloma cells were either grown in
monoculture (M) or in co-culture with patient-derived bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs).
Co-cultured myeloma cells were either separated from BMSCs by transwell inserts that
allow soluble factor diffusion (Tw) or adhered to BMSC monolayers (Cx, a). Adhesion to
patient-derived BMSCs enhances PYK2, JAK1 and STAT3 phosphorylation in myeloma
cells lines (b, c) and patient specimens (d, e). Knockdown of β1 integrin diminishes the
activation of PYK2 induced by adhesion to BMSCs (f, g). All immunoblots are
representative of at least three independent experiments. RNA interference data were
repeated using three unique constructs per target.

presence of indicated concentrations of the clinically relevant FAK/PYK2 inhibitor VS-6063
(defactinib). PYK2 activation in myeloma cell lines (a) or patient specimens (b) grown in
monoculture (M) or co-cultured with BMSCs (Cx) was assessed by measuring pY402 via
immunoblot. Tumor cell colony formation in methylcellulose was used to quantify
clonogenic growth as previously described (c–f).31,33 Cell lines and patient specimens
shown in panels c and d match those displayed directly below in panels e and f. Clonogenic
growth of an ALDH-positive myeloma cell subpopulation was also measured (g, h). Error
bars are represented as s.e.

PYK2 inhibition reduces tumor burden and increases overall survival in vivo. 5TGM1
murine myeloma cells were cultured in the presence of murine M2-10B4 bone marrow
stoma for 2 h. Myeloma cells were either adhered to stroma (Cx) or grown in monoculture
(M) and PYK2 activation was assessed by measuring pY402 via immunoblot (a). 5TGM1
myeloma cells were treated with indicated concentrations of Pyk2 inhibitor VS-4718 for 24
h in monoculture or in co-culture with M2-10B4 stroma, and apoptosis was measured by
measuring surface Annexin V expression via FCM (b). One million 5TGM1-luc cells were
injected into 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/KaLwRijHsd mice. Tumor burden was assessed by
measuring levels of IgG2b paraprotein by ELISA weekly (c) or luciferase activity at 4 weeks
(d). Survival was assessed until the onset of hind-limb paralysis (e). Error bars are
represented as s.e.m. Indicated P-values were generated using T-test with a 95% confidence
interval in c and d. The significance of Kaplan–Meyer survival curves was determined by
the log-rank test. P-values <0.05 were considered to be significant.
