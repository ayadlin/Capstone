ABSTRACT
The interplay between tumor microenvironment and cancer that causes
chemoresistance remains unclear. By analyzing public available microarray datasets,
we identified that periostin (POSTN) was overexpressed in cancer stroma in
epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed
overexpression of stromal POSTN is a powerful independent poor prognostic predictor
for EOC patients. Furthermore, patients with high levels of stromal POSTN tend to
have higher percentage of cisplatin resistance compared to those with low levels of
stromal POSTN. Moreover, we found POSTN treatment can induce cisplatin resistant
and activate AKT pathway in A2780 cells in vitro. Inhibition of AKT activity by AKT
inhibitor MK-2206 abolished POSTN-induced AKT activation and cisplatin resistance
in vitro. Taken together, we found high POSTN expression in cancer microenvironment
is correlated with poor prognosis in EOC patients and associated with platinum
resistance. The effect of POSTN in cancer stroma cells may activate AKT pathway in
tumor and AKT inhibitor can be beneficial to augment the efficacy of existing cancer
therapeutics.

(~30%) [2]. Platinum-resistance, defined as relapse within
6 months, is one of the major causes for the low survival
rate. It is also a big challenge for successful treatment
and a reference for deciding second-line treatments [3].
Therefore, predictive biomarkers for platinum-resistance
in EOC patients are desperately needed.
Periostin (POSTN, formerly called 改成 also
known as osteoblast-specific factor-2) is a disulfide-liked
90-kDa secretary protein expressed in the periosteum in
bone tissues as well as an extracellular matrix (ECM)

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the third most
common type of gynecologic cancer in the United States
but a leading cause of gynecologic cancer deaths. It is
estimated that 21,980 new cases were diagnosed in 2014,
with 14,270 deaths [1]. Although aggressive surgical
cytoreduction followed by standard platinum-taxene
chemotherapy generally improved the survival rate of
EOC patients, the 5-year survival rate remains dismal

protein [4–6]. POSTN is up-regulated in a wide variety
of cancer, such as colon, pancreatic, breast, head and
neck, thyroid, and gastric cancer, non-small cell lung
cancer and neuroblastoma [4, 7–12]. POSTN mRNA
levels is also upregulated in ovarian tumors [13], and its
expression in ovarian tumor cells was correlated with
clinical late stage and tumor recurrence [14]. EOC cells
can secret POSTN and accumulate in malignant ascites
of ovarian cancer patients [11]. Moreover, recombinant
purified POSTN supports the adhesion and migration of
ovarian epithelial cancer cells by interacting with integrin
receptors αVβ3 and αVβ5 [11]. POSTN also increases
tumor angiogenesis and decreases tumor cell apoptosis
in EOC [14]. Neutralizing monoclonal antibody against
POSTN was shown to inhibit anchorage-independent
growth and survival of POSTN-expressing cells and its
neutralizing effects also suppress cancer cell migration
and invasion [15]. Expression of POSTN in ovarian
tumor cells was correlated significantly with advanced
stage and disease recurrence [14].However, an increasing
number of evidences showed that POSTN expressed in the
cancer microenvironment was also associated with poor
prognosis in various types of cancer such as non-small
cell lung cancer [16], pancreatic cancer [17, 18], prostate
cancer [19] as well as ovarian cancer [20, 21]. Therefore,
the histological localization of POSTN expression that
really impacts patient survival remains controversial.
POSTN can activate the PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway through αvβ3 integrin to increase cellular
survival in colon cancer [22] and through α6β4 integrin
complex to promote invasiveness and resistance of
pancreatic cancer cells to hypoxia-induced cell death
[17]. In EOC, recombinant POSTN can also stimulate Akt
phosphorylation to increase resistance to paclitaxel [23].
Molecular actions in AKT pathway were shown to be an
important determinant of chemosensitivity to platinum in
EOC [24–26]. However, the relationship between POSTN
expression and platinum resistance has not been studied
intensively in EOC.
In this study, we used tissue microarray that
consists 308 epithelial ovarian cancer patients to analyze
the prognostic value of POSTN and its association with
chemo-response and clinical outcome.

microarray data found that the POSTN was overexpressed
in CS along with other cytokines, growth factors and ECM
components compared to NS (Figure 1A). Furthermore,
POSTN mRNA expression was compared among NS (n
= 8), OSE (n = 12), CS (n = 7), and CPEI (n = 18). The
result showed that CS expressed the highest POSTN mRNA
across all groups (Figure 1B). In another microarray datasets
(GSE29156) that contain laser capture micro-dissected
normal epithelium samples, tumor samples, adjacent tumor
stroma samples and distal tumor stroma samples from both
benign and malignant ovarian tumor, we found POSTN
mRNA expression of malignant adjacent cancer stroma (Adj)
was also the highest among all (Figure 1C).

Stronger association of POSTN expression in
cancer stroma and poor prognosis compared to
tumor cells
To determine the prognostic value of POSTN
form different histological location, we performed
immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis using tissue array
that consists 308 EOC patients. Protein expression of
POSTN can be observed in the cancer stroma and cancer
cells. The staining expression was semiquantatively and
arbitrarily score ranged from 0 (negative expression), 1
(weak expression), 2 (moderate expression) to 3 (strong
expression) modified from Choi et al [20] (designed as
0, no staining or less than 10% of stromal or tumor cells
; 1, weak, 10-30% of stromal or tumor cells ; 2, 30-60%
of stromal or tumor cells; 3, more than 60% of stromal or
tumor cells). Then we divided patients into high POSTN
expression as score 3 and low POSTN expression as score
0-2 (Figure 2A and 2C).
Table 1 summarized the number of patients with
high POSTN expression in cancer stromal cells was 93
(30.2 %) and that with low POSTN expression was 215
(69.8%). The mean age of the patients was 53.96 ± 13.08
years old (range: 13-85 years old). The mean duration
of follow-up was 48.5 ± 35.1 months (range: 1.0-160
months). The patients with strong POSTN staining in
tumor-associated stroma had higher ratio of advanced
FIGO stage compared with patients with low POSTN
expression in cancer stroma (41.4% vs 20.6% ; p <
0.001). More optimal surgery were achieved in patients
with low POSTN expression in cancer stromal cells (p
= 0.025). There was no difference in age (p = 0.202),
histological subgroups (p = 0.813), tumor grading (p =
0.747) and level of ca-125 pre-operatively (p = 0.359)
or after 1st chemotherapy (p = 0.175) between the two
groups. High stroma POSTN expression was associated
with higher prevalence of high POSTN expression tumor
cells (correlation coefficient = 0.219; p < 0.001). Also,
patients with high POSTN expression in cancer stroma
had higher tumor recurrent rate than patients with low
POSTN expression in cancer stroma after first treatment
(52.7% and 25.6%, p < 0.001).

RESULTS
Identification of up-regulated POSTN in ovarian
cancer stroma
To determine gene expression signatures in different
histological localization of ovarian cancer, we analyzed
microarray datasets from GSE38666 that has gene expression
profiles of 7 cancer stroma (CS) samples and 18 cancer
epithelium samples (CEPI), along with 8 normal stroma
(NS) samples and 12 normal ovarian surface epithelium
(OSE) samples. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the

In the analysis of clinical outcome, patients with
a high POSTN expression in cancer stroma (n=93) had
a mean disease-specific overall survival (OS) of 58.2 ±
6.2 months [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 46.3-70.4
months] and disease-specific progression-free survival
(PFS) of 58.3 ± 7.2 months [95% CI, (44.4-72.6) months],
whereas those with low POSTN expression in cancer
stroma (n = 215) had a mean disease-specific OS of 129.1
± 4.7 months (95% CI, 119.9-138.3 months) and mean
PFS of 117 ± 5.0 months (95% CI, 107.3-126.8). Patients
with high stromal POSTN expression had significantly
lower OS and PFS than those with low stromal POSTN
expression (both p < 0.001) (Figure 2B). On the other
hands, patients with high POSTN expression in tumor (n
= 114) did not show significant prognostic value in OS and
PFS compared to patients with low POSTN expression in
tumor (Figure 2D). Next, we performed survival analysis
according to various combinations of tumor POSTN and
stromal POSTN status (Figure 3A). The results showed
patients with high POSTN expression in both stroma and
tumor had the shortest OS and PFS among other groups
(Figure 3B and 3C). Furthermore, multivariate Cox

regression analysis showed that stromal POSTN levels
and platinum resistance were found to be the only two
significant predictors of patient outcome as evaluated by
FPS (Table 2) or OS (Table 3).

POSTN induces cisplatin resistance in A2780
cells through AKT activation
To determine the relationship between POSTN and
platinum resistance, we analyzed a subset of 140 patients
that received platinum therapy. Patients with resistance
or refractory group were defined as those with disease
recurrence within 6 months after primary platinum-based
chemotherapy or those persist with diseases (n = 35; 25.0
%), whereas patients in platinum sensitive group were
defined as those who were disease-free for more than
6 months after primary platinum-based chemotherapy
(n = 105; 75 %) (Supplementary Table S1). Our results
showed patients with high stromal POSTN expression
had significantly higher percentage of platinum resistant
patients compared to patients with low stromal POSTN
(37.5 % versus 18.5 %, p = 0.023, Figure 4A). Cisplatin-

DISCUSSION

resistant cell line A2780cis has increased pAKT then
A2780 (Figure 4B). After adding POSTN, both cells line
increased pAKT to similar intensity. To explore the effect
of POSTN treatment on platinum sensitivity in A2780
epithelial ovarian cancer cells, we treated the A2780 cell
line in 4 groups: (1) control group (2) POSTN group with
recombinant POSTN protein (1 μg/ml) in cultured medium
for 24 hours (3) AKT inhibitor group with MK-2206(1
μg/ml) for 2 hours (4) combined group with recombinant
POSTN protein (1 μg/ml) in cultured medium for 24 hours
followed bv AKT inhibitor groups with MK-2206(1 μg/
ml) for 2 hours. Protein levels of endogenous POSTN
in the A2780 cell line increased after treatment with
recombinant POSTN, and was capable of phosphorylating
Akt at serine 473 and inhibited by AKT inhibitor, MK2206 (Figure 4C). Recombinant POSTN increased
cisplatin IC50 of A2780 from 18 μM to 23 μM and then
decreased to 14 μM after adding MK-2206 (Figure 4D).
Taken together, the results revealed that stroma POSTN
may induce resistance to cisplatin through activating Akt
pathway and platinum resistance can be reversed by AKT
inhibitor (Figure 4E).

Nearly all of ovarian cancer patients received firstline platinum/taxane-based treatment regimen as the
standard care. However, many patients are intrinsically
resistant to platinum therapy. Therefore, biomarkers that
can be used to predict platinum response are urgently
needed. In this study, POSTN protein immunoreactivity
observed in cancer stromal cells was found to be a
predictive marker for platinum response and survival
prognosis. Furthermore, the pathway involved in POSTN
and platinum response in EOC may be related to the
activation of AKT pathway. AKT inhibitor, MK-2206,
can enhance the platinum response with patients with high
POSTN expression in the tumor microenvironment, which
may provide as a biomarker for clinical trial.
In the present study, the the mRNA expression
levels in cancer stroma cells were the highest among
those in tumor cells and normal ovarian tissues. The
highest relative mRNA expressions of POSTN were
observed in malignant adjacent cancer stromal area
among distal regions and tumor cells. The clinical

correlation of POSTN expression location in epithelial
ovarian carcinoma cell or tumor stroma cells is still
controversial. Zhu et al. showed that POSTN expression
in tumor cells was significantly higher in advanced
stage, high grade and recurrent tumors in 126 patients
with primary and recurrent EOCs [14]. Recently, Choi
et al. presented that POSTN was mainly expressed in
cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts, but not in cancer
cells and the expression level of POSTN in cancer
stromal cells was highly correlated with FIGO staging,

tumor mitosis, poor survival, distal metastasis, tumor
recurrence of 66 ovarian cancer patient cohorts [20].
Similar findings were also reported in other types of
cancer. In NSCLC, POSTN in cancer stroma cells is
a prognostic factor for poor progression-free survival
[27]. In prostate cancer, IHC analysis showed POSTN
expression was up-regulated in high-grade prostate
cancers and stromal POSTN was shown to be a
progression factor for prostate specific antigen relapsefree survival [28]. Stromal expression of POSTN was

also correlated with poor survival and bone metastasis
in breast cancer [29]. Here, we showed that higher
POSTN expression in cancer stromal cells, rather than
in tumor cells, was significantly correlated with shorter
disease-specific progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) in multivariate analysis. Taken
together, POSTN expression in cancer stromal cells
can be served as a poor prognostic marker for epithelial
ovarian cancer. However, in this study, tissue microarray
contained different subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer
and borderline tumor and cannot distinguish which
subtype of EOC is more correlated to POSTN expression
due to limited numbers in different subtypes. EOC is a
complex disease due to varieties of histological subtypes
and different populations have variable distributions
of those subtypes of EOC [30]. Further investigations
are needed to determine the role of stromal POSTN in
different subtypes of EOC.
In a previous study, tumor POSTN expression
was shown to significantly promote intraperitoneal
tumor metastatic growth in immunodeficient mice by
increasing tumor angiogenesis and decreased tumor cell
apoptosis [14]. Malanchi et al. reported that POSTNdeficient tumor cells of breast cancer cannot form tumor
spheres and this can be rescued by adding POSTN

protein in primary cultures. Stromal POSTN was found
to connect the metastatic niche and cancer stem cell to
create a cancer stem cell (CSC) -supportive niche and
promote metastatic colonization by augmenting the
Wnt signaling pathway [31]. Here, we found high levels
of POSTN expression in cancer stroma was correlated
with advanced disease stage, which is often associated
with peritoneal and distal metastasis. Further study is
needed to investigate the relationship between POSTN
in tumor microenvironment and ovarian cancer stem cell
properties.
Chien et al. showed carcinoma-associated
mesenchymal stem cells (CA-MSC) secretions
can promote AKT and XIAP phosphorylation and
suggested that tumor microenvironment as well as the
extracellular matrix (ECM) can alter tumor’s response
to chemotherapy [32]. POSTN was found to bind
to the integrins αvβ3, αvβ5, and α6β4 to promote the
recruitment of the epidermal growth factor receptor [33]
or to active the Akt/PKB- and FAK mediated signaling
pathways [8]. Ryner et al recently reported that POSTN,
LOX (lysyl oxidase), and FAP(fibroblast activating
protein) were the top 3 up-regulated genes within the
peritumoral stromal, which were specifically associated
with the clinical chemoresistance. They also reported

high levels of POSTN could predict shorter progressionfree survival following first-line chemotherapy by
analysing on a set of 85 ovarian tumors as well as on
an independent validation dataset containing 138 ovarian
patients from the chemo-treatment arm of the ICON7
trial recurrent tumors [21]. Moreover, Ryner et al also
revealed that ovarian tumor cells grown in the presence
of recombinant POSTN protein promoted resistance to
carboplatin and paclitaxel treatment in vitro [21]. Similar
to our findings, we found POSTN treatment increased
the resistance to cisplatin through AKT pathway and
could be reversed by AKT inhibitor, MK-2006 (Figure
4C–4E). MK-2206 is an orally active allosteric Akt
inhibitor that is under development for the treatment of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

solid tumors. MK-2206 is a highly potent and selective
Akt inhibitor [34]. Some studies revealed that MK2206 synergistically enhanced cell growth inhibition
induced by chemotherapeutic agents in several ovarian
cancer cell lines [34, 35]. In this study, we found that
MK-2206 can decrease resistance to cisplatin caused by
POSTN treatment and the results suggested that POSTN
expression in cancer stroma may be an indicator for poor
survival and platinum resistance and the use of MK-2206
may be beneficial to augment the efficacy of existing
cancer therapeutics.
The alternate hypothesis for chemoresistance is
that cancer cells can acquire extracellular matrix (ECM)dependent platinum resistance [32]. Serial analysis of

gene expression (SAGE) profiling of cisplatin-resistant
and sensitive cells revealed many ECM genes expressions
such as collage VI, are elevated in the resistant cells.
Sensitive cells in the present of collagen VI protein
promoted resistance. The other ECM protein, fibrillin-1,
expressed in primary tumor are associated with early
recurrence in platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer [36]. In
the present study, POSTN can be stained either in stromal
cell and cancer cells in vivo with positive correlation. By
adding POSTN protein, we showed increased POSTN
protein expression in tumor cells in vitro. Taken together,

ECM component may play an important determinant for
drug response.
In summary, we found that expression of POSTN
in cancer stromal cells, rather than in tumor cells, not
only serves as a prognostic factor for clinical outcome
but also an important indicator for platinum response
in EOC patients. The resistance to cisplatin induced by
tumor environment POSTN may be dependent on tumor
intrinsic PI3K/AKT pathway, which provides a window of
opportunity for reversing platinum resistance by targeting
AKT.

from 18 μM to 23 μM and then decreased to 14 μM after adding MK-2206. E. Schematic model shows the relationship between stromal
POSTN and the development of platinum resistance in ovarian cancer. Periostin in cancer stroma can activate intracellular AKT-S473
phosphorylation to promote platinum resistance, which can be reversed by AKT inhibitor, MK-2206.

chemotherapy including platinum and paclitaxel regimen
was given to 283 patients after surgery except in 9 patients
with borderline tumor and 16 patients with low risk early
stage disease, who could not tolerate the chemotherapy or
had persist tumor after suboptimal cytoreductive surgery”
change to “16 patients with low risk early stage disease
or who could not tolerate the chemotherapy. A clinical
remission was defined as no palpable tumor and normal
CA-125 levels after the completion of chemotherapy.
Patients were then followed up every 3 months during the
first 5 years, and then every half year thereafter. Recurrence
was defined as elevation of CA-125 or pathologically
proved adenocarcinoma after complete recovery from
the cancer. Surgery or chemotherapy was initiated when
relapse occurred. Sensitivity to primary platinum-based
chemotherapy was defined as recurrence after 6 months after
completing primary platinum-based regimen, and resistant
or refractory was defined as recurrence within 6 months after
primary platinum therapy or persist/stable diseases [3].
The ovarian cancer tissue samples obtained at the
primary surgery were stained with hematoxylin and eosin
and reviewed to confirm the histopathologic diagnosis
and tumor grading. All specimens were collected under
protocols approved by the institutional review board of
both hospitals.

Gene expression analysis of tumor and tumor
environment in EOC
To evaluate mRNA level of POSTN in normal
stroma cells, cancer stroma cells, normal ovarian surface
epithelial cells, and cancer epithelial cells, we analyzed the
microarray data retrieved from GSE38666 (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE38666) and
GSE29156 (downloaded from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE29156) of the NCBI
GEO database. The GSE38666 microarray data contains
gene expression datasets of 8 normal stroma (NS) and
8 matched normal ovarian surface epithelium (OSE)
from 12 individuals, along with 7 cancer stroma and 7
matched cancer epithelium from 18 additional ovarian
cancer patients. The GSE29156 microarray data contains
23 tissue samples laser capture micro-dissected from an
ovary with a benign serous tumor (specifically 4 normal
epithelium samples, 5 tumor samples, 6 stroma samples
adjacent to the tumor, and 8 stroma samples distal of
the tumor), and 27 tissue samples laser capture microdissected from an ovary with a malignant serous tumor
(specifically 5 normal epithelium samples, 8 tumor
samples, 7 stroma samples adjacent to the tumor, and 7
stroma samples distal of the tumor).

Patients and tumor samples
Tumor tissues in paraffin blocks of 308 female
patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian adenocarcinoma
and borderline ovarian cancer were obtained from
the surgical archives of the Department of Pathology
and Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Taipei
Veteran General hospital, and the surgical archives of the
Department of Pathology and Department of Gynecology
and Obstetrics, Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital. The time of diagnosis of the patients from
the Taipei Veteran General hospital was between 2000
to 2008, and that of Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital was between 2000 to 2007.
Clinical stage after debulking surgery was determined
using the criteria established by the International Federation
of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO staging system for
ovarian cancer 2009) [37]. Clinical data including age,
cytoreduction status (optimal vs. suboptimal), type of
chemotherapies, overall survival (OS) and disease-free
survival (DFS) were retrieved from medical records. The
duration of OS was measured from the date of diagnosis
to death or censored at the date of last follow-up. The
DFS was measured as the duration between the dates of
diagnosis to disease recurrence. Cytoreductive operations
include total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingooophorectomy, infra-omentectomy, appendectomy, and
pelvic and para-aortic lymph node sampling and were

Tissue array construction
The tissue arrays were constructed with a total of
308 primary epithelial ovarian cancers, which included 99
serous adenocarcinoma, 61 endometrioid adenocarcinoma,
63 clear cell adenocarcinomas and 48 mucinous
carcinomas. Fourteen borderline tumors were also included.
Twenty-three transitional cell carcinomas or mixed type
were grouped into the histological subtype as others. Paired
normal tissues were arrayed adjacent to the corresponding
cancerous tissues as described previously [40]. Matched
H&E reference slides were cut from all donor blocks and
graded, and targeted tissue types of interest were marked.
For the tissue array construction, core tissue biopsies
(diameter 1 mm; height 3-4 mm) were taken from paraffinembedded tumor blocks and were precisely arrayed into
a new recipient paraffin block (27 × 22 mm). Tissue core
biopsies were subsequently punched from selected regions
of the donor blocks using a thin-wall, stainless steel tube
that was sharpened similar to a corkscrew. Once the
TMA block had been prepared, the blocks were sectioned
into 4-µm thick sections, stained with H&E for use as a
reference to confirm the histology, and subsequently treated
with target immunohistochemical stains.

Immunohistochemistry

(1μM) cultured for 2 hours was MK-2206 group.
Recombinant periostin protein (1μg/ ml) was added
for 24 hours followed by MK-2206 (1μM) for another
2 hours was added in the combined group. Then 3 sets
of cells were exposed to a range of drug concentrations
of cisplatin. Cell proliferation was measured with the
SRB assay [41] and IC50 were analyzed according
to the method of Chou and Talalay [42] by using the
CompuSyn software program downloaded from http://
www.combosyn.com/.

The formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
sections (5 μm) were deparaffinized in xylene and
rehydrated in graded concentrations of ethanol. Antigen
retrieval was enhanced by heating the slides at 121°C for
5 minutes in DAKO target retrieval buffer (pH 6.1) using
a pressurized decloaking chamber (Biocare Medical).
Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen
peroxide followed by normal goat serum (10%) blocking
for 1 hour. Sections were next incubated at 4°C for 12
hours with primary anti-human POSTN (rabbit polyclonal,
1:250 dilution, Genetex, Taiwan). Sections were rinsed
with PBS twice and incubated for 1 hour with biotinylated
secondary antibodies followed by 30-min incubation at
room temperature with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated
streptavidin. Immunostaining was developed with DAB (33′ diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride) and counterstained
with light hematoxylin. The sections were examined by
light microscopy. A four-point staining intensity scoring
system was used for determining the relative expression
of POSTN in cancer specimens and related stromal;
the staining expression was semiquantatively and
arbitrarily score ranged from 0 (negative expression), 1
(weak expression), 2 (moderate expression) to 3 (strong
expression) modified from Choi et al [20] (designed as 0,no
staining or less than 10% of stromal or tumor cells ; 1, weak,
10-30% of stromal or tumor cells ; 2, 30-60% of stromal or
tumor cells; 3, more than 60% of stromal or tumor cells).
All of the immunohistochemical staining results were
reviewed and scored by two independent pathologists."

Western blotting analysis
Cells treated by indicated conditions were
pelleted by centrifugation and rinsed with PBS. The
cell pellets were then lysed in RIPA buffer. DNA in
the lysate was sheared by a sonicator. Concentration
of protein was determined using Lowry assays (BioRad). Protein extracts were loaded onto SDS-PAGE and
were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Inc.). The membranes were analyzed by
specific primary (p-AKT, AKT,POSTN and GAPDH)
and secondary antibodies. The signals were developed
using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham
Biosciences,UK).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using the
PASW computer program package (PASW Statistics v18,
Chicago, IL, USA). The association between POSTN
expression cancer stroma and tumor cell expression
and clinicopathological parameters and drug response
was evaluated using the Fisher's exact test. Univariate
survival analysis was based on the Kaplan–Meier method.
Comparison between the survival curves was analyzed
using the Log-rank or the Breslow test. The prognostic
significance of POSTN expression in cancer stroma or
cancer cell expression concerning other pathological
variables was assessed using the multivariate Cox’s
proportional hazard’s analysis. A value of p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Cell line, chemicals and reagents
Human ovarian adenocarcinoma A2780 /A2780cis
cells were purchased from The European Collection of
Cell Cultures (ECACC). All cell culture reagents were
purchased from Invitrogen (Taiwan). Recombinant
human POSTN protein and anti-POSTN antibody were
purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antiglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
antibody and primary antibodies against AKT, phosphoAKT (p-AKTSer473) were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Cisplatin
(cis-Diammineplatinum(II) dichloride) and AKT inhibitor
MK-2206 were purchased from Adooq Bioscience (Irvine,
CA, USA).
