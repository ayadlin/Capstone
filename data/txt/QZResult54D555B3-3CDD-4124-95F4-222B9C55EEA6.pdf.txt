Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is a major oncological challenge due to its
aggressive growth and metastasis. In the current study, we
investigated the role of anterior gradient 2 (AGR2) in these
processes. AGR2 mRNA, as assessed by quantitative real-time
reverse transcription–PCR (Q-RT-PCR), was 14-fold higher in
pancreatic cancer compared with normal and pancreatitis
tissues. Immunohistochemistry revealed high expression of
AGR2 in neoplastic cells with 98% (56 of 57) positivity on
pancreatic cancer and minimal staining in normal and
pancreatitis tissues. AGR2 was also expressed in early
pancreatic intraepithelial neoplastic lesions. RT-PCR and
Western blotting showed elevated AGR2 expression in seven
of nine pancreatic cancer cell lines. AGR2, as detected in
conditioned media from cancer cells, indicated that it was
secreted. The influence of AGR2 on pancreatic cancer cells was
evaluated by silencing with small interfering RNA and short
hairpin RNA. Silencing of AGR2 significantly reduced cell
proliferation (MTS assay) and invasion (Boyden chamber
assay) and improved gemcitabine sensitivity ( fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis). Conditioned media from cells
in which AGR2 was silenced had a reduced ability to stimulate
proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that
secreted AGR2 was active. In vivo, silencing of AGR2 in
MPanc-96 cells led to a significant reduction of tumor growth
and increased the effectiveness of gemcitabine treatments in
orthotopic tumor models evaluated by noninvasive bioluminescence imaging. In summary, AGR2 is expressed and
secreted during pancreatic cancer development and plays an
important role in cancer cell growth and survival. These
observations suggest that AGR2 may be a useful molecular
target in pancreatic cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):7811–8]

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most deadly tumor types.
The 5-year survival rate after diagnosis is <3.5% (1). One reason for
the poor prognosis is that the molecular mechanisms underlying
pancreatic oncogenesis remain poorly understood. Altered levels of
gene products are thought to be associated with the changed
behavior of cancer cells (2). Large-scale analysis of gene expression
has been widely proposed as a powerful method for malignancy

diagnosis and predicting invasion and metastasis through the
identification of biomarkers. Pancreatic cancer has previously been
the focus for studies of cancer-specific gene expression (3–5). In
our previous study, we identified genes expressed specifically in
pancreatic cancer cells by comparing microarray generated
expression profiles of resected adenocarcinoma with those of
normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis (6). Among the genes,
highly specifically expressed in pancreatic cancer was anterior
gradient 2 (AGR2).
AGR2, also known as hAG-2 (7) or Gob-4 (8), is the human
orthologue of the Xenopus laevis AGR protein, XAG-2. XAG-2 has
a putative role in ectodermal patterning of the frog embryo and
is regulated by a number of fundamental embryonic molecules
like noggin and chordin (9). In the frog embryo, XAG-2 is
secreted and induces cement gland differentiation and expression of neural marker genes in a fibroblast growth factor–
dependent way (9). The function of AGR2 in humans is unclear.
Some evidence suggests that, in humans, the AGR2 protein may
also be secreted (10). Others have suggested, based on Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool Analysis (11), that AGR2 may
represent a novel member of the protein disulfide isomerase
family involved in protein maturation in the endoplasmic
reticulum (12, 13). Overexpression of AGR2 was found to
attenuate p53 activation in UV-damaged cancer cells, leading
to the suggestion that AGR2 functions as a survival factor
through inhibition of p53 (14). In other studies, rat mammary
tumor cells overexpressing AGR2 showed enhanced adhesion to
substratum and increased metastatic potential (10). Gene
expression profiling of circulating tumor cells in peripheral
blood from metastatic cancers (colorectal, prostate, and breast
cancers) showed the presence of AGR2 (15). AGR2 has been
shown previously to be expressed in breast (7, 16), prostate (17),
and lung (18) cancers, although its role in these diseases is
unknown. Recently, AGR2 was shown to act as an oncogene
when overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells (19).
The aim of our present study was to investigate the presence and
function of AGR2 in pancreatic cancer. We found that AGR2 was
highly expressed in precancerous lesions and in neoplastic cells of
pancreatic tumors and cancer cell lines. Pancreatic cancer cell lines
secreted AGR2 into the culture media. Silencing of AGR2 decreased
cancer cell proliferation and invasion and increased gemcitabine
sensitivity of resistant cells in vitro and reduced tumor growth and
increased gemcitabine effectiveness in vivo. These data support the
further investigation of AGR2 as a potential target for pancreatic
cancer therapy.

and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIn) slides (n = 10) were
obtained from the Department of Pathology, University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer. Pancreatic cancer cell lines BxPC3, MiaPaCa-2, CFPAC-1,
HPAC, Panc-1, Aspc-1, and SU.86.86 were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection. MPanc-96 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were
originally established by Dr. Timothy J. Eberlein (20). BxPC3 and SU.86.86
cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Panc-1,
MiaPaCa-2, CFPAC-1, HPAC, Aspc-1, and MPanc-96 cells were routinely
cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. All cells were maintained at 37jC in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Antibody (rabbit polyclonal) against
AGR2 was a kind gift from Dr. Devon A. Thompson, Department of Surgery,
Stanford University.
Immunohistochemical staining. Unstained 5.0-Am sections of clinical
specimens or a matched tumor/benign pancreatic tissue microarray were
deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated with ethanol. Immunohistochemistry was performed using RTU Vectastain Elite ABC Universal kit
(Vector Laboratories), as described previously (21). Primary antibody
against AGR2, diluted 1:250 in 2% bovine serum albumin/0.2% Triton in
PBS was added, and samples were incubated overnight at 4jC followed
by biotinylated secondary antibody. Finally, slides were developed with
3,3-diaminobenzidine substrate counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated with ethanol, fixed with xylene, and mounted. Immunohistochemistry was analyzed using Olympus microscope (Olympus). Images were
captured using a chilled, charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics) and
SmartCapture software (Digital Scientific). Images were further processed
with Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems). The staining results were
evaluated by a gastrointestinal pathologist (Dr. Huamin Wang) to determine
the intensity and the percentage of positive tumor cells. The expression of
ARG2 was categorized as positive (cytoplasmic staining of z10% of the
tumor cells) and negative (cytoplasmic staining of <10% of the tumor cells).
The staining intensity of positive cells was further graded as either strong,
moderate, or low.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR and reverse
transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from normal pancreas
(n = 5), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 6), and chronic pancreatitis
(n = 5) tissues and pancreatic cancer cell lines (n = 8), and the quality of
RNA was tested as mentioned previously (21). Primers designed for human
AGR2 (Genbank NM_006408) were forward 5¶ATG GAG AAA ATT CCA GTG
3¶ and reverse 5¶ TTA CAA TTC AGT CTT CAG 3¶. The AGR2 primers were
also specifically compared with the sequence of the related gene AGR3 (16)
and showed no significant homology. Quantitative real-time reverse
transcription-PCR (Q-RT-PCR) was performed for the tissue samples with
Syber green as the tag on the I-cycler machine (Bio-Rad). Levels of mRNA
expression were expressed in terms of fold difference. Pancreatic cancer cell
lines were analyzed for AGR2 expression, and amplified products were
separated on 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide. Primers
designed for h-actin (Genbank BC_016045), which was used as a loading
control for the PCR reactions, were forward 5¶ ATG ATA TCG CCG CGC
TCG TCG TC 3¶ and reverse 5¶ CGC TCG GCC GTG GTG GTG AA 3¶.
Collection of conditioned media. For collection of conditioned media,
wild-type cell lines, including SU.86.86 and MPanc-96, were grown to 80%
confluence, washed with PBS, and then cultured for 24 h in serum-free
media. Media were collected and concentrated 10 using Centricon YM-3
filter devices (Millipore Corporation). Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories).
Transient transfection of small interfering RNA. Pancreatic cancer
cells (BxPC3, Su.86.86, CFPAC-1, and MPanc-96) were plated on 100-mm
dishes and transiently transfected with prevalidated On-Target plus Smart
Pool siRNAs-siControl and siAGR2 at a final concentration of 10 nmol/L
(Dharmacon, Inc.) with Hiperfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Inc.), and
lysates were prepared for Western blot after 72 h.
Development of short hairpin RNA stable cell lines. We examined the
effects of stable short hairpin RNA (shRNA) silencing of AGR2 in pancreatic
cancer cells using BLOCK-iT-RNAi Entry vector kit and pBLOCK-iT 3-DEST
vector (Invitrogen Corporation). MPanc-96 cells, which express relatively
high levels of AGR2, were transfected with an shRNA designed for AGR2 or
with a LacZ control shRNA (shControl, 5¶ GCT ACA CAA ATC AGC GAT TT

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

3¶). Two different shRNAs were created for AGR2 using the Invitrogen’s
BLOCK-iT RNAi Designer protocol [Invitrogen Corporation; AGR2 target
sequence 1 (shAGR2-1) 5¶ GCT TAC GAA CCT GCA GAT ACA 3¶ and AGR2
target sequence 2 (shAGR2-2) 5¶ GCC CAC ACA GTC AAG CTT TAA 3¶]. The
shRNAs were annealed and cloned into a BLOCK-iT U6 RNAi entry vector
containing the human U6 pol III type promoter. For stable silencing, the
shControl, shAGR2-1, and shAGR2-2 were cloned into DEST vectors,
according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Stable expression of shControl,
shAGR2-1, and shAGR2-2 were established in MPanc-96 cells by selecting
for neomycin resistance (1 mg/mL) and silencing of AGR2 in the lysates
were verified by Western blotting.
Western blotting. Cell lysates and conditioned media were prepared,
and protein concentrations were measured by Bio-Rad reagent. Protein
(50 Ag) was loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and Western blot was
conducted using primary antibody against AGR2 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000
dilution). The same blot was reprobed for h-actin (1:200 dilution; Sigma),
which served as loading control for the experiment. Precision plus protein
standards (Bio-Rad) served as molecular weight markers. Western blot
imaging and processing were done with Odyssey machine (LiCor
BioScience).
Cell growth studies. Cell growth was analyzed using MTS reagent
(Promega) according to the manufacturer’s directions. Pancreatic cancer
cells transiently transfected with siControl or siAGR2 for 24 h and MPanc-96
cells stably transfected with shControl or shAGR2-1 or shAGR2-2 vectors
(1,000 cells) were plated on 96-well plates and grown on 0.5% serum
containing media. Cell numbers were estimated after 0, 24, 48, and 72 h by
adding MTS to the wells 1 h before taking the photometric reading, as
described previously (21).
Invasion assays. For studies of cell invasiveness, BIOCOAT Matrigel
invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) were used. Briefly, pancreatic cancer
cells transiently transfected with siControl or siAGR2 for 48 h and MPanc-96
cells stably transfected with shControl or shAGR2-1 or shAGR2-2 vectors (2
 105) were suspended in 100 AL serum-free media and were added to the
upper chamber and 0.5% serum containing DMEM was added into the
lower chamber. The cells were allowed to invade the Matrigel for 24 h at
37jC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The invaded cells were analyzed, as
described previously (21).
Apoptosis study by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis
in vitro. Standard propidium iodide staining by the hypotonic lysis method
was used for apoptosis studies based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS). Pancreatic cancer cells transiently transfected with siControl and
siAGR2 for 24 h and MPanc-96 cells stably transfected with shControl or
shAGR2-1 or shAGR2-2 were seeded in 100-mm plates. Apoptosis was
induced by treating with gemcitabine (1 Amol/L) for 72 h, and cells were
collected by trypsinization, washed once with cold PBS, mixed with 500 AL
of hypotonic solution (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 Ag/mL
RNase, 50 Ag/mL propidium iodide) for 30-min incubation and analyzed by
flow cytometry using EPICS-XO (Beckman Coulter). Cells undergoing
apoptosis (due to the DNA fragmentation) were detected as the population
of cells with sub-G1 DNA contents.
Apoptosis study by TUNEL assay in vivo. Analysis of apoptotic cells
in tumor tissue was done by using a commercially available TUNEL kit
(Promega), as described in detail previously (22). Paraffin sections from
tumor tissue treated with and without gemcitabine were analyzed for
apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry was analyzed using Olympus microscope (Olympus). Images were captured using a chilled, charge-coupled
device camera (Photometrics) and SmartCapture software (Digital
Scientific). Images were further processed with Adobe Photoshop software
(Adobe Systems). To quantify the apoptotic events, the number of cells
undergoing apoptosis in 10 random fields at 100 magnification was
counted.
Tumor growth study in vivo. Orthotopic tumors were formed in 4-wkold male athymic nude nu/nu mice with MPanc-96 cells stably expressing
shControl or shAGR2-1. Both AGR2 silenced cell lines showed the same
effects in vitro; therefore, we choose one cell line (AGR2-1) for further
in vivo studies compared with the shControl cells. These cells were further
modified to stably express the firefly luciferase gene by lentivirus

transfection (23). Cells were then grown to 80% confluence, harvested by
trypsinization, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended to a final
concentration of 1  106 cells/mL. Cell suspensions (0.1 mL) were injected
into the pancreas of five mice per test group. From the second week
onwards, these mice were treated with or without the chemotherapeutic
drug gemcitabine (100 mg/kg body weight twice a week i.p.; group 1,
shControl; group 2, shControl + gemcitabine; group 3, shAGR2-1; group 4,
shAGR2-1 + gemcitabine).
Tumor growth was assessed by bioluminescence using a cryogenically
cooled imaging system coupled to a data acquisition computer running
LivingImage software (Xenogen Corp.) as mentioned previously (21).
Before imaging, animals were anesthetized in an acrylic chamber with
1.5% isofluorane/air mixture and injected i.p. with 40 mg/mL of luciferin
potassium salt in PBS at a dose of 150 mg/kg body weight. A digital
grayscale animal image was acquired followed by acquisition and overlay
of a pseudocolor image representing the spatial distribution of detected
photons emerging from active luciferase within the animal. Signal
intensity was quantified as the sum of all detected photons within the
region of interest per second. After the final tumor imaging, the pancreas
was removed and the animals were reimaged to visualize and count

cancer cell metastases. Tissues were also fixed with formaldehyde, and
histology was conducted to verify the accuracy of the bioluminescence
data.
Statistical analysis. All the in vitro experiments were conducted in
triplicate and carried out on three or more separate occasions. Data
presented are means of the three or more independent experiments F SE.
Statistically significant differences were determined by two-tailed unpaired
Student’s t test and were defined as *P < 0.05.

Results
AGR2 is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues and
cell lines and is secreted. In profiling studies, AGR2 mRNA levels
have previously been found to be elevated in pancreatic tumor
(6, 24), pancreatic cancer cell lines (25), and preneoplastic
pancreatic intraepithelial lesions (26). To identify the specific cells
expressing this molecule, we conducted immunohistochemistry.
AGR2 was difficult to detect in normal pancreas, although low
levels of expression were sometimes observed in normal duct but
not in acinar cells or islets (Fig. 1A). In tumor tissues, AGR2 levels

samples of chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic
adenocarcinoma, and PanIN lesions.
Chronic pancreatitis samples did not
stain for AGR2. In contrast, pancreatic
adenocarcinomas showed strong positive
staining for AGR2 (the arrow indicates low
level of AGR2 expression in adjacent
benign pancreatic tissue). High levels of
AGR2 expression were also found in
PanIN-1, PanIN-2, and PanIN-3.

(lanes 8 and 9, respectively). h-Actin was

Figure 2. Transient silencing of
AGR2 reduces pancreatic cancer cell
proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis.
A, to access the effectiveness of siAGR2,
AGR2 levels were determined in pancreatic
cancer cells after being transfected with
siControl or siAGR2 at a concentration of
10 nmol/L. Cell lysates were prepared
after 72 h, and Western blotting was
performed with an anti-AGR2 antibody and
anti–h-actin as loading control. AGR2 was
either partially or completely silenced in
pancreatic cancer cell lines. The
micrograph shown is representative
of three independent experiments.
A full-length gel is presented in
Supplementary Fig. S4. B, to determine the
effects of AGR2 on cell proliferation,
pancreatic cancer cell lines transfected
with siControl or siAGR2 were plated into
96-well plates, and cell numbers were
estimated by MTS assay after 48 h. AGR2
silencing resulted in significant reduction in
cell proliferation. C, for investigation of the
effects of AGR2 on cell invasion, cells were
transfected with siControl or siAGR2 and
plated into Boyden chambers for invasion
studies. After 24 h, the invaded cells in 10
random fields at 100 magnification were
counted. AGR2 silenced cells showed a
significant reduction in cell invasion.
D, for apoptosis studies, cell lines were
transfected with siControl or siAGR2 and
were then treated with or without
gemcitabine (1 Amol/L). After 72 h, the
percentage of cells with a sub G0/G1 DNA
content was identified by FACS analysis.
AGR2 silencing resulted in increasing the
sensitivity of the cells to gemcitabine and,
therefore, resulted in increased apoptosis.

were very high in pancreatic cancer cells. AGR2 was not expressed
in the stroma of tumors or in foci of chronic pancreatitis. AGR2
was also expressed in the dysplastic duct cells in all grades of
pancreatic intraepithelial neoplastic (PanIN) lesions (Fig. 1A). To
evaluate the frequency of AGR2 expression in pancreatic tumors,
we analyzed a tissue microarray and observed that 98% (56 of 57)
of pancreatic cancer tissues were positive, of which staining was
high in 60%, moderate in 22%, and low in 18%. These data confirm
that AGR2 is highly expressed during pancreatic cancer development and in the neoplastic cells of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. For
quantitation, we used Q-RT-PCR analysis to compare levels of
AGR2 mRNA in samples of pancreatic cancer, normal pancreas,
and chronic pancreatitis (Fig. 1B). AGR2 mRNA levels were 14-fold
higher in pancreatic cancer compared with normal pancreas and
chronic pancreatitis.
Further investigation of AGR2 mRNA levels in pancreatic cancer
cell lines indicated that six of eight pancreatic cancer cell lines
were positive for AGR2 (Fig. 1C; full-length gel is presented in
Supplementary Fig. S1). This was further confirmed at the protein
level by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D, a; full-length gel is presented
in Supplementary Fig. S2). AGR2 was recognized as an 18-kDa
protein, similar to what has been previously reported (17). As a
loading control, h-actin was used and recognized as a 42-kDa
protein. To determine whether AGR2 was secreted, we analyzed
conditioned media from pancreatic cancer cells by Western blot
(Fig. 1D, b; full-length gel is presented in Supplementary Fig. S3).
AGR2 was identified in the media bathing the cells of SU.86.86 and

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

MPanc-96 and in their respective lysates, whereas in rest of the cell
lines, it could not be detected in the media. To control for protein
spilling from damaged cells, we probed for h-actin, as a
nonsecreted control. Actin was found in the lysates but not in
the conditioned media that was positive for AGR2, supporting its
status as a secreted molecule.
AGR2 levels correlate with rates of pancreatic cancer cell
proliferation, invasion, and survival in vitro. To evaluate the
functional role of AGR2, four different pancreatic cancer cells
were transiently transfected with siControl and siAGR2, and
silencing was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 2A; full-length gel
is presented in Supplementary Fig. S4). Cells were then analyzed
for changes in cell proliferation, invasion, and resistance to
treatment with the cytotoxic agent gemcitabine. Proliferation was
significantly reduced at 48 hours in AGR2 silenced cells when
compared with their respective siControl transfected cells (Fig.
2B). Silencing of AGR2 also significantly reduced the invasion of
pancreatic cancer cells that expressed AGR2 natively (Fig. 2C). To
analyze the effects on cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy, cells with high levels of AGR2 secretion, SU.86.86 and
MPanc-96, were treated with gemcitabine (1 Amol/L) in the
presence of either siControl or siAGR2. Silencing of AGR2 more
than doubled the apoptotic response to gemcitabine in both cell
lines (P < 0.05; Fig. 2D).
To further investigate the influence of AGR2, the MPanc-96
pancreatic cancer cell line that had a relatively high level of
endogenous AGR2 was genetically modified using shRNA

constructs to stably reduce AGR2 levels. Western blotting verified
shRNA silencing, and AGR2 protein levels were reduced by >90%
with either shAGR2-1 or shAGR2-2 (Fig. 3A; full-length gel is
presented in Supplementary Fig. S5). The effects of stably
reducing AGR2 expression levels were then evaluated on MPanc96 cell proliferation, invasion, and survival in vitro. There was a
significant decrease in proliferation of AGR2 silenced MPanc-96
cells when compared with MPanc-96 cells stably expressing
shControl after 48 h (Fig. 3B). Silencing of AGR2 in MPanc-96
cells also significantly decreased the extent of cell invasion when
compared with shControl transfected cells (Fig. 3C). Likewise,
silencing of AGR2 had a dramatic effect on the resistance of
MPanc-96 cells to treatment with gemcitabine. MPanc-96 cells
are gemcitabine resistant and gemcitabine at 1 Amol/L had no
significant effect on rates of apoptosis in wild-type cells.
However, after stable silencing of AGR2 gemcitabine-induced

cell killing was significantly increased (23-fold) compared with
cells expressing shControl (Fig. 3D).
AGR2 silencing reduces pancreatic cancer in vivo. Based on
our observations on the effects of AGR2 on pancreatic cancer cell
growth, invasion, and survival in vitro, we further wished to
analyze its effect on tumors developed in vivo in immunedeficient mice. Orthotopic tumors were developed with MPanc-96
cells stably expressing shControl or shAGR2-1 and followed using
noninvasive bioluminescence imaging. MPanc-96 cells with
silenced AGR2 expression showed a dramatic 4-fold reduction
in tumor volume compared with shControl transfected cells
(Fig. 4A; P < 0.05). As expected, there was no statistical effect of
gemcitabine treatment on shControl groups of these highly
resistant cells. However, after silencing of AGR2 in this cell,
gemcitabine treatment caused a significant reduction in tumor
volume compared with controls. Supporting the sensitization of

invading the lower chamber were estimated
after 24 h using MTS reagent. Cellular

significant increase in the gemcitabine
sensitivity, and therefore, increase in
apoptosis was observed. Columns, mean

(2 concentrated) from MPanc-96 cells stably bearing shControl
or shAGR2 were added to MiaPaCa-2 cells, and the effects on
cell numbers was determined (Supplementary Fig. 6). Condition
media from control MPanc-96 cells significantly stimulated the
growth of MiaPaCa-2 cells. In comparison, conditioned media from
MPanc-96 cells silenced for AGR2 (shAGR2-1 and shAGR2-2)
stimulated significantly less growth of MiaPaCa-2 cells. This
supports the suggestion that the secreted AGR2 is functionally
active.

treatment was assessed in nude mice. Bioluminescent imaging was used to
estimate tumor volume. AGR2 silencing with and without gemcitabine
significantly reduced the tumor volume. B, in vivo apoptosis was measured by
TUNEL assay on paraffin sections from shControl and shAGR2-1 animals
treated with gemcitabine. AGR2 silencing along with gemcitabine treatment
significantly increased the apoptosis in tumor tissues. Columns, mean for five

the MPanc-96 cells by silencing of AGR2, TUNEL analysis
indicated significant increase of apoptotic cells on tissues silenced
with AGR2 and treated with gemcitabine when compared with all
other tissues (Fig. 4B).
We also evaluated metastasis at the end of the study. AGR2
silencing alone did not reduce the incidence of metastases, but
in combination with gemcitabine, there was a complete
reduction of lung metastasis (100%) and 60% reduction of liver
metastasis (Table 1). The number of metastatic foci was reduced
by silencing AGR2 itself and gemcitabine treatment further
significantly reduced the numbers of metastases in lung and
liver (Table 2).
Secreted AGR2 is functionally active. To examine whether
the AGR2 secreted by pancreatic cancer cell lines was
functionally active, proliferation studies were performed on
MiaPaCa-2 cells, which do not secrete AGR2. Conditioned media

AGR2 has been previously noted as overexpressed in pancreatic
cancer based on expression profiles (6, 24–26). This is the first
report validating these observations in a large number of tumors.
Furthermore, this study showed for the first time the secretion of
AGR2 in pancreatic cancer cell lines and elucidated some of the
effects of this molecule in cancer cells and tumors. AGR2 silencing
significantly inhibited cell proliferation, invasion, and survival
in vitro; inhibited tumor growth in vivo; and sensitized cancer cells
to gemcitabine both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these data
suggest that AGR2 may be a reasonable target for the development
of future therapies.
AGR2 was markedly increased at both mRNA and protein levels
in pancreatic cancer cells compared with their benign counterparts, indicating that AGR2 expression might be involved in the
malignant progression of pancreatic cancer. Our data show that,
even in the early stages of pancreatic cancer development, in
PanIn, AGR2 was found to be highly expressed. In other cancers,
like breast cancer (27) and prostate cancer (28), the expression of
AGR2 was correlated with the poor survival of patients. However,
in our analysis of pancreatic tumors by immunohistochemistry,
we could not find any correlation between AGR2 levels and
patient outcomes likely due to its prevalence in virtually all
patient samples of cancer. It may be that a quantitative analysis
would indicate a prognostic significance but such a study has not
yet been conducted. It was also reported that AGR2 was
coexpressed with estrogen receptor (7) and its expression was
induced by estrogen in breast cells (29) and by androgen in
prostate cells (17). However, the expression and functions of
AGR2 in pancreatic cancer cells suggest that AGR2 is not
hormone-inducible in this tissue.
Previous literature suggested that AGR2 could be a secretory
molecule. In Xenopus laevis, translation of the single open reading
frame revealed a protein of 185 amino acids with a putative
hydrophobic signal sequence from amino acid positions 1-18 as
calculated by the signal sequence prediction method (9). In breast
cancer tissues, the presence of NH2 terminal cleavable secretory
signal sequence was predicted (16) and the presence of AGR2 was
shown as granular cytoplasmic appearance by immunohistochemistry (10, 16, 27). In another study, it was shown that AGR2 was
likely a secretory molecule as the signal peptide was cleaved from
this molecule when performing rabbit reticulocyte transcription/
translation coupled with microsomal vesicle processing (17). In a
recent publication, it was shown that conditioned media from an
esophageal adenocarcinoma cell line expressing higher levels of
AGR2 enhanced the migration of cells in which AGR2 was knocked
down (19). The current study is the first to provide direct evidence
in human pancreatic cancer cells that AGR2 is secreted. We found
that AGR2 was present in the media of pancreatic cancer cells
expressing high levels of AGR2, whereas a cytoplasmic protein,

NOTE: AGR2 silencing combined with gemcitabine treatment reduces the metastasis incidence in vivo. Tumors were developed in nude mice with

gemcitabine. At the end of the experiment, animals were analyzed by bioluminescence imaging, and the incidence of metastasis was calculated in lung
and liver. AGR2 silencing in combination with gemcitabine significantly reduced the lung and liver metastasis incidence. Data shown are mean F SE for

actin, was not. These data strongly support its identity as a
secreted molecule. That we did not observe the presence of AGR2
in the media from all of the cell lines probably relates to variations
in the levels of production and to the sensitivity of our assay. This
secreted AGR2 seemed to be biologically active as suggested by the
observation that condition media from cells expressing AGR2 was
significantly better at stimulating pancreatic cancer cell growth
than that from cells silenced for AGR2.
That AGR2 is secreted suggests that it may generate some of its
biological effects by acting in an autocrine or paracrine manner.
Previously, yeast two-hybrid cloning analysis suggested that AGR2
can interact with metastasis gene (C4.4a) and with dystroglycan
(DAG-1; ref. 16). However, whether these interactions are involved
in the effects of AGR2 in cancer remain uncertain. Neither of
these molecules is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer.
Identification of the receptor through which the functions of
AGR2 are mediated will provide another potential target for
therapeutic development.
Our current observation that silencing AGR2 sensitized the cells
to cell killing by gemcitabine may be of particular translational
significance. Previously, AGR2 has been suggested to be involved in
cell survival based on its specific up-regulation in breast cancer
cells subjected to serum and oxygen depletion (30). Also, AGR2 was
reported to inhibit p53 tumor suppressor–mediated effects in
response to UV exposure (14). Molecules that provide a survival
benefit may protect cells from chemotherapeutic treatments.
Pancreatic cancer is well recognized as being highly resistant to

therapeutics. In the current study, transient silencing of AGR2
increased the effectiveness of gemcitabine treatment in two cancer
cell lines in vitro, and stable silencing had a more profound effect,
probably related to a greater reduction in cellular levels of AGR2.
Furthermore, in vivo experiments indicated that the effects of
AGR2 on gemcitabine resistance were also important in vivo. These
data suggest that the inhibition of AGR2-regulated pathways could
be of clinical benefit in pancreatic cancer treatment. Future efforts
will be devoted to understanding the mechanisms and pathways
involved in the effects of AGR2 in chemoresistance and the possible
use of inhibitors of these pathways to sensitize cancer cells to
chemotherapy.
In the current study, it seemed that AGR2 might also influence
metastasis. We observed a significant reduction in invasiveness
in vitro after AGR2 silencing. We also observed a reduction in the
incidence and volume of metastases in vivo. However, in the
current study, it was not possible to determine if this was a direct
effect on metastasis or simply due to the great reduction in the
primary tumor. Previously, it was reported that AGR2 was involved
in developing lung metastasis in breast cancer as ectopic
expression increased metastasis but did not show any effect on
primary tumor growth (10). Further research will be necessary to
understand all of the roles of this important new regulator of
pancreatic cancer.
In summary, the current study describes the expression and
function of AGR2 in pancreatic cancer. This molecule was found to
stimulate growth, invasiveness, and survival in vitro and tumor
