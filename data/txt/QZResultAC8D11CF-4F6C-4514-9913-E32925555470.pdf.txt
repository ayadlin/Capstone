ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy is one of the basic treatments for cancers; however, drug
resistance is mainly responsible for the failure of clinical treatment. The mechanism of
drug resistance is complicated because of interaction among various factors including
drug efflux, DNA damage repair, apoptosis and targets mutation. Long non-coding
RNAs (lncRNAs) have been a focus of research in the field of bioscience, and the latest
studies have revealed that lncRNAs play essential roles in drug resistance in breast
cancer, gastric cancer and lung cancer, et al. Dysregulation of multiple targets and
pathways by lncRNAs results in the occurrence of chemoresistance. In this review, we
will discuss the mechanisms underlying lncRNA-mediated resistance to chemotherapy
and the therapeutic potential of lncRNAs in future cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION

receptors [6]. Similarly, the combination of cisplatin
and trastuzumab is the mainstream therapy for patients
with HER2-positive gastric cancer [7]. The inhibition of
EGFR2 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
2 have also confirmed their efficacy in the treatment of
advanced gastric cancer [8]. Although chemotherapeutics
have prolonged disease-free survival and OS for many
patients, an inevitable problem that has gradually emerged
is the propensity of tumor cells to become resistant to
drugs that have been used previously, or even to drugs
that are chemically and functionally unrelated, suggesting
that tumor cells can adopt common resistance mechanisms
[9]. Both intrinsic and acquired drug resistance can greatly
limit the effectiveness of chemotherapy [10, 11]. Solving
this problem is an urgent concern.
With the rapid development of bioinformatics
analysis and application of next-generation sequencing
technology to whole genomes and transcriptomes, it has
become clear that only 2% of the human genome encodes
proteins whereas 98% of transcriptional products are noncoding RNAs [12]. Most non-coding RNAs consist of
more than 200 nucleotides, and are defined as long (or
large) non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) [13, 14]. For past
decade, lncRNAs have been varified to participate in a
series of cellular processes including cell proliferation,
apoptosis, migration, and invasion and regulate gene
expression at epigenetic, transcriptional, and post-

Malignant cancer is the most severe disease
threatening human health, considerably reducing the
quality of human lives. With the advent of various
anticancer drugs, cytotoxic and molecularly targeted
compounds have become the first-line standard treatment
regimens for most cancer patients when surgery is not an
appropriate option [1, 2]. In 2004, it was first reported
that a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) conferred a clinical response to EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). To date, three generations of EGFR TKIs
have been developed, and the third-generation molecular
targeted drug WZ4002 exhibits high activity against
tumor cells harboring EGFR with the T790M mutation.
Clinical trials showed that progression-free survival
(PFS) of patients with detectable T790M was significantly
prolonged after taking the third-generation TKIs [35]. Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2(HER2)
positive breast cancer accounts for about a quarter of
breast cancers. HER2 amplification induces cell growth
and suppresses cell death. Recently, the application of
trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy was shown
to increase overall survival (OS) of patients with HER2
overexpression by achieving a blockade of HER2

transcriptional levels dependent on diverse cell locations.
Importantly, a large amount of misregulated lncRNAs
have been linked to human cancers development and
progression. These lncRNAs involve in regulation
of cancer cells growth, metastasis and chemotherapy
drug resistance through diverse mechanisms, including
interacting with RNA binding proteins such as polycomb
repressive complex 2 (PRC2), behaving as decoys to
compete with other proteins for the binding position of
target genes or specific microRNAs, and modifying
mRNA structure and affecting stability of mRNA [1518]. Interestingly, many well-known transcription factors
(such as E2F1, P53, SP1 et al.) and epigenetic regulators
(such as EZH2, DNMT1) mediated DNA methylation or
histone modifications have been found to contribute to
lncRNAs aberrant transcriptional activation or inactivation
in cancer cells [19-21]. In this review we describe multiple
mechanisms of drug resistance including drug efflux, DNA
damage repair, mutations of drug targets, and cancer cell
apoptosis and highlight the important roles of long noncoding RNAs in the regulation of drug resistance of cancer
cells.

or biological factors. To sustain the stabilization of
chromosomes, DNA damage is efficiently repaired through
activation of repair genes. Conversely, dysfunctional
activation of the DNA repair pathway readily results
in the occurrence of tumors [27]. It is well known that
chemotherapeutics trigger DNA damage through direct
or indirect mechanisms, which may contribute to the
acquisition of cytotoxicity. If such damage can be
repaired in tumor cells, there is a possibility that they will
survive under chemotherapy or become more tolerant to
chemotherapeutic agents. For instance, DNA is the key
target of traditional chemotherapy drugs such as platinum,
and cancer cells tend to be more resistant to platinum as
a result of abnormal DNA damage repair activation [28,
29]. A latest study has observed that NF-κB/HOTAIR have
interaction in DNA damage response in development of
chemoresistance [30]. Accordingly, specific inhibition
of DNA repair is believed to improve the efficacy of
chemotherapeutics.

MECHANISMS OF CANCER CELL DRUG
RESISTANCE

Two classic pathways are involved in cell apoptosis:
the intrinsic pathway regulated by chondriosomes and
the extrinsic pathway regulated by tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) receptors. [10] The Bcl-2 protein family includes
both apoptosis-inducing proteins such as Bax, Bad,
and Bid, and antiapoptosis proteins like Bcl-2 and Bclxl. These proteins antagonize each other to maintain a
relatively balanced condition in cells. Once the balance is
disrupted, resistance to chemotherapy drugs that interefer
apoptosis may arise during tumorigenesis [31]. It has been
demonstrated that downregulation of Bcl-2 can increase
sensitivity to chemotherapeutics [32]. In addition, high
expression of Bcl-xl predicts poor prognosis in NSCLC
[33]. Alterations in protein expression of TNF family
members such as TNFR-1, Fas, DR4, and DR5 may lead
to resistance to anticancer drugs. It has been noted that
soluble Fas could block apoptosis induced by Fas [34,
35]. A clinical trial has verified that mutation of DR4
and DR5 contributes to drug resistance in glioma [36]. A
recent study observed that expression of P-gp is inversely
associated with expression of TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand or Apo2L (TRAIL), which mediates
the apoptosis pathway in MDR cells. TRAIL has been
implicated as a potent therapeutic target in clinical trials
[37].

Apoptosis

Alterations in drug efflux
The ATP-binding cassette family in humans
possesses 49 known transporters that move drug
compounds out of cells to sustain intracellular drug
concentration, directly leading to multidrug resistance
(MDR) in cancer cells. Among these proteins, P
glycoprotein (P-gp), adenosine triphosphate-binding
cassette superfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), and multidrug resistant associate protein (MRP) have been
extensively studied in many solid tumors such as breast
cancer and ovarian cancer [22]. P-gp is overexpressed
in several cancers including neuroblastoma, myeloma,
and colorectal cancer. It has been demonstrated that
overexpression of P-gp predicts an unfavorable prognosis
[23]. The expression of P-gp encoded by the MDR1
gene increases when normal tissues are transformed to a
neoplastic state [24]. Some proteins, such as H-Ras, Raf1, MEK1, and MEK2 involved in MAPK pathway, act
as downstream receptors that upregulate the P-gp level,
thus regulating the cellular environment and leading to the
development of drug resistance. Conversely, inhibition of
ERK pathway reduces P-gp expression [25, 26].

Mutation of drug targets
Molecular targeted therapy is an advanced treatment
option in cancer therapy that has become a major focus
in cancer research because of fewer side effects and
higher efficacy than standard chemotherapy agents [38].
Several different molecules can be considered targets

Dysfunction of DNA damage repair
In normal cells, the DNA repair pathway is activated
when DNA damage is induced by physical, chemical,

for therapy, such as members of the signal transduction
pathway; however, clinical tests have determined that
drug resistance can be achieved when the pathway is
altered [39-41]. Estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast
cancer patients have a favorable prognosis compared
with ER-negative patients but exhibit a higher recurrence
rate following endocrine treatment. This is attributed to
a decrease in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Moreover,
activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway results in
resistance to endocrine drugs [42, 43]. Patients with lung
cancer usually acquire resistance to EGFR TKIs due to the
T790M mutation, the secondary mutation in EGFR [44].
Overexpression of BCR-ABL1 may account for the main
mechanism of imatinib resistance. Clinically, patients with
the BCR-ABL1 T315I mutation lose sensitivity to most
second-generation TKIs [45].

knockdown of extracellular vesicle long non-coding RNA
derived from extracellular vesicles reduced expression of
ABCG2, promoting sorafenib-induced cell apoptosis in
hepatocellular carcinoma [57]. PVT1 is associated with
cisplatin resistance by inhibiting apoptotic pathways in
ovarian cancer [58]. The lncRNAs involved in cancer
cell drug resistance and their regulated targets/pathways
related to cancer drug resistance are listed in Table 1.

lncRNAs and breast cancer drug resistance
ER-positive mammary cancers are mostly dependent
on estrogenic growth stimulation and antihormone therapy
is the major clinical treatment for ER-positive breast
cancer. Regrettably, although anti-hormone therapy is
widely applied to cure breast cancer patients, it cannot
totally suppress the growth of breast cancer cells [59].
BCAR4 is a strong oncogene that transforms breast cancer
cells into an estrogen-independent, antiestrogen-resistant
state. In addition, loss of estrogen receptor 1(ESR1) does
not result in tamoxifen resistance, as verified in ZR/
BCAR4 cells, and inhibition of ESR1 does not affect the
drug resistant capacity of ZR/BCAR4 cells [60]. In 2010,
Godinho et al. showed that high levels of BCAR4 predict
poor PFS and patients with high expression of BCAR4
are likely to be resistant to endocrine therapy. In addition,
expression of ERBB2 and ERBB3 was elevated in ZR/
BCAR4 cells, indicating that activation of ERBB2/ERBB3
signaling may contribute to BCAR4-induced proliferation
in the presence of tamoxifen. Cell proliferation was
inhibited after knockdown of BCAR4. An identical result
was observed upon knockdown of ERBB2/3, implying
that BCAR4 acts in an ERBB2/3-dependent manner
[59, 61, 62]. Recently, Xue et al. found that HOTAIR
expression was significantly higher in tamoxifen-resistant
breast cancer tissues compared with primary cancer
tissues. HOTAIR was directly repressed by estrogen
and conversely upregulated in the absence of hormone.
Interestingly, increased HOTAIR expression may
strengthen ER signaling, stimulating ER transcriptional
activities even under an estrogen-deprived environment.
Moreover, functional studies revealed that a high level of
HOTAIR promoted the growth of breast cancer, whereas
silencing of HOTAIR abolished tamoxifen-resistant cell
growth [63]. Shi et al. found that lnc-ATB was remarkably
upregulated in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer
cells and tissues. Lnc-ATB could promote trastuzumab
resistance and then induce an invasion-metastasis cascade
in breast cancer by competitively sponging miR-200c,
thereby upregulating ZEB1 and ZNF-217. In addition,
overexpression of lnc-ATB was positively associated with
trastuzumab resistance of breast cancer patients(Figure 1)
[64]. Li et al. reported that GAS5 suppressed cancer cell
growth by sponging miR-21, resulting in downregulation
of phosphatase and tensin homolog(PTEN), the target
of miR-21(Figure 1) [65]. Triple-negative breast cancer

LONG NON-CODING RNA IN CANCER
CELL DRUG RESISTANCE
Recently, numerous lines of evidence have indicated
that lncRNA expression is widely altered in cancers
and that lncRNAs participate in various aspects of
tumorigenesis through inactivation of tumor suppressors or
activation of oncogenes [46-48]. For example, expression
of the lncRNA MALAT1 is decreased by treatment with
S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) suggesting that epigenetic
regulation of MALAT1 expression is predominantly
through DNA methylation [49]. Our previous studies
have revealed that the expression pattern of several
lncRNAs, such as HOTAIR, SPRY4-IT1, BANCR, and
PVT1, is altered in human NSCLC and gastric cancer.
Among these, PVT1 is significantly upregulated in
NSCLC tissues and cells, and increased PVT1 expression
promotes NSCLC cell proliferation and suppresses
apoptosis through epigenetic repression of transcription
of the tumor suppressor LATS2 by binding with enhancer
of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit(EZH2)
[50]. In addition, the lncRNA HOTAIR is overexpressed
in gastric cancer and either promotes cell proliferation
and metastasis by functioning as a ceRNA to sponge up
miR-331-3p or epigenetically silences miR34a by binding
to PRC2 [51, 52]. HOTAIR has also been identified as
a cell proliferation regulator through binding to EZH2
in glioma cells [53]. Moreover, lncRNA BC032469
can directly bind to miR-1207-5p as a ceRNA that may
decrease the expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase
in gastric cancer, and UCA1 can sponge miR-485-5ps and
antagonize its repression of matrix metallopeptidase 14 in
epithelial ovarian cancer cells [54, 55]. Notably, emerging
evidence has shown that lncRNAs are also actively
involved in cancer cell drug resistance. Meijer et al. first
identified BCAR4 through a functional genetic screen in
the ER-positive and estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell
line ZR-75-1. Ectopic expression of BCAR4 in ZR-75-1
cells induces hydroxytamoxifen resistance [56]. Moreover,

account for one fifth of all breast cancers. Jiang et al
reported lncRNA HIF1A-AS2 and AK124454 contributed
to paclitaxel resistance in triple-negative breast cancer
through transcriptome analysis [66].
Together, these findings provide new insight
into breast cancethe involvement of lncRNAs in breast
cancer drug resistance, and it is essential to identify more
lncRNAs that could be potential therapeutic targets for
chemotherapy-resistant breast cancer patients [67].

MRUL enhanced chemosensitivity of MDR gastric cancer
cell sublines to P-gp-related chemotherapy drugs. MRUL
knockdown in MDR cells led to increased doxurubicin
concentration and a reduced Bcl-2/Bax ratio that may
promote the rate of apoptosis. Additionally, in vitro and
in vivo results showed that MRUL depletion decreased
ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1)
mRNA levels. Heterologous luciferase reporter assays
showed that MRUL performed an enhancer-like role to
promote ABCB1 transcription [70]. Hang et al. found
that Notch 1 overexpression positively regulated lncRNA
AK022798 during gastric cancer progression. Silencing
of AK022798 significantly reduced the cell viability of
cisplatin-resistant cell lines SGC7901/DDP and BGC823/
DDP and the expression of MRP1 and P-gp, and increased
apoptosis of SGC7901/DDP and BGC823/DDP cells.
AK022798 may become a new target for the treatment of
terminal-stage gastric cancer [71]. Zhang et al. reported
that PVT-1 was highly expressed in gastric cancer tissues
of cisplatin-resistant patients and BGC823/DDP and
SGC7901/DDP cells. In addition, transfection of BGC823/
DDP and SGC7901/DDP cells with PVT-1 siRNA could
overcome the resistance of these two cisplatin-resistant
cell lines, whereas overexpression of PVT1 exhibited
antiapoptotic activity in BGC823 and SGC7901 cells
exposed to cisplatin. Moreover, qRT-PCR and western

lncRNAs in gastric cancer drug resistance
Several studies have documented that various
lncRNAs are dysregulated in gastric cancer, and that
their aberrant expression is related to tumorigenesis,
metastasis, or drug resistance. Han et al. found that
LEIGC knockdown in MGC-803 cells resulted in reduced
sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)
[68, 69]. Wang et al. showed that the lncRNA MRUL was
located near the MDR1 gene region and that expression
of MRUL was higher in both SGC7901/VCR and
SGC7901/ADR cells than in SGC7901 cells. P-gp-related
chemotherapy drugs are considered to be the standard
treatment for patients encountering MDR. Patients with
high MRUL levels responded negatively to chemotherapy
drugs. Consistent with this finding, downregulation of

the expression of phosphatase and tensin homologs (PTEN) by sponging miR-21. Downregulation of GAS5 leads to trastuzumab resistance

blotting analyses showed that the expression of MDR1,
MRP, mTOR, and HIF-1a increased upon upregulation
of PVT1. These findings suggest that lncRNA PVT1 may
play a critical role in the development of MDR in gastric
cancer [72]. Shang et al revealed that UCA1 knockdown
inhibited the resistance to adriamycin of SGC7901/
ADR cells, UCA1 silencing promoted apoptosis through
upregulating expression of PARP and suppressing Bcl2 levels [73]. Lan et al found that ANRIL was greatly
upregulated in cisplatin resistant and 5-Fu resistant
patients. The rate of tumor growth significantly decreased
after transfected with si-ANRIL, and the levels of MDR1,
MRP1 also reduced [74].

in gefitinib-sensitive and gefitinib-resistant cells using
lncRNA microarray. Bioinformatics analysis showed
that these aberrantly expressed lncRNAs were involved
in regulating resistance to EGFR-TKIs by influencing
neighboring genes. Pathway analysis revealed that cell
proliferation and apoptosis were associated with the
development of EGFR-TKI resistance [81]. In addition,
Wu et al screened 1476 lncRNAs dysregulated in EGFRTKI-resistant cell line of lung adenocarcinoma, which
further illustrated lncRNAs may play as biomarkers in
EGFR-TKI therapy [82]. In our previous studies, we
found that HOTAIR expression was significantly increased
in cisplatin-resistant A549/DDP cells, and that siRNAmediated silencing of HOTAIR could partly restore the
responses of A549/DDP cells to cisplatin. Functional
analysis demonstrated that p21 is the underlying target
of HOTAIR and overexpression of p21 partially rescued
the HOTAIR-induced cisplatin resistance in A549/DDP
cells [83]. In addition, we also revealed that MEG3
expression is decreased in A549/DDP cells, and exogenic
overexpression of MEG3 partially reversed the cisplatin
resistance of A549/DDP cells through the regulation
of p53 and Bcl-xl expression [84]. Moreover, Yang et
al. identified eight lncRNAs that were differentially
expressed in A549/DDP cells. Downregulation of
one of these lncRNAs—lincAK126698 depressed the
induction of apoptosis by cisplatin in A549 cells, possibly
through decreased naked cuticle homolog 2 expression
and increased β-catenin expression resulting in altered
Wnt signaling [85]. Dong et al. reported that a high
level of GAS5 reduced tumor growth both in vitro and
in vivo under treatment with gefitinib. In addition, they
confirmed that IGF-1R is a key downstream mediator
that was inversely correlated with expression of GAS5
[86]. Wu et al. demonstrated that linc00635-001 silencing
accompanied by gefitinib treatment suppressed Akt
activation and sensitized HCC827-8-1 cells to gefitinibinduced cytotoxicity [87]. Fang et al testified HOTAIR
recruited HOXA1 by RNA immunoprecipitation. HOTAIR
silencing reduced methylation of HOXA1, and enhanced
the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer drugs in SCLC
[88].

lncRNAs in bladder cancer drug resistance
Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard firstline treatment for bladder cancer, whereas gemcitabine
plus cisplatin is approved for metastatic urothelial cancer.
However, most patients ultimately experience disease
recurrence due to the poor response to therapy [75]. Wang
et al. used RACE technology to obtain full-length cDNA
for UCA1, which is believed to play a role in bladder
cancer progression. Cell viability studies by MTT assay
showed that expression of UCA1 in BLS-211 cells caused
resistance to cisplatin, and further studies determined that
the level of serine-arginine protein kinase 1 was inversely
related to UCA1 expression [76]. Wang et al. reported
that overexpression of UCA1a led to fewer apoptotic
cells after cisplatin treatment [77]. Fan et al. suggested
that upregulation of UCA1 in patients with bladder cancer
partially contributed to cisplatin-based therapy. Likewise,
UCA1 expression levels were higher in cisplatin-resistant
bladder cancer cells. Forced expression of UCA1
augmented cell viability even in the presence of cisplatin,
whereas UCA1 inhibition reduced cell viability during
cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, UCA1 remarkably
increased expression of Wnt6 in human bladder cancer cell
lines, and their expression was also positively correlated
in vivo. Finally, UCA1 promoted cisplatin resistance
of bladder cancer cells by enhancing the expression of
Wnt6 and activating Wnt signaling. Thus, the UCA1/
Wnt6 pathway represents a potential target for conquering
chemoresistance in bladder cancer [78].

lncRNAs in drug resistance of other cancers

lncRNAs in lung cancer drug resistance

Researchers demonstrated that expression of
lncRNA ODRUL was increased in doxorubicinresistant osteosarcoma cell lines. ODRUL knockdown
led to suppression of the ABCB1 gene, which is related
to multidrug resistance [89]. Silencing of HOTTIP
increased the chemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells
to gemcitabine. The expression of HOTTIP showed a
positive correlation with HOXA13 and the biological
behavior of HOTTIP was partially modulated by
HOXA13. Moreover, a high level of HOXA13 predicted
poorer prognosis in pancreatic cancer [90]. Tsang et al.

The developments of platinum-based chemotherapy
and targeted therapies for EGFR-sensitive and ALKpositive patients have been milestones in lung cancer
treatment [79]. Nonetheless, increasing proportions
of patients eventually develop acquired resistance
[80]. Cheng et al. speculated that lncRNAs may play a
pivotal role in resistance to EGFR-TKIs. They found
that numerous lncRNAs were differentially expressed

observed that H19 inhibition decreased the expression of
MDR1/P-glycoprotein and increased cellular doxorubicin
accumulation and doxorubicin sensitization in both
HepG2 parent cells and R-HepG2 cells. MDR1 promoter
methylation was inversely correlated to MDR1 expression
level, and only half of the CpG island sites at the MDR1
promoter region were hypomethylated in R-HepG2 cells.
Furthermore, there was an increase in MDR1 promoter
methylation level after H19 knockdown. These findings
demonstrated that H19 altered P-glycoprotein expression
and induced MDR1-associated drug resistance by
modulating MDR1 promoter methylation (Figure 1) [91].
A recent study reported that linc-ROR expression was
induced by sorafenib in HCC cells, whereas knockdown
of linc-ROR enhanced chemotherapy-induced cell death.
Silencing of linc-ROR attenuated the expression of
the CD133+ cells present among tumor-initiating cells
that resulted in progression of chemoresistance [92].
Lee et al. identified that upregulation of lncRNA snaR
promoted apoptosis of colon cancer cells after 5-FU
treatment. In contrast, loss of snaR decreased sensitivity
of cancer cells to 5-FU [93]. Ma et al. showed that the
lncRNA CCAL acted as an oncogene in colorectal cancer
progression; patients with high CCAL expression had
shorter survival and worse response to chemotherapy.
CCAL mediated a reduction in AP-2α protein-activated
Wnt/β-catenin signaling, inducing multidrug resistance
and upregulating MDR1/P-gp expression. Moreover,
CCAL was upregulated by histone H3 methylation and
deacetylation in colorectal cancer (Figure 1) [94]. Bian
et al detected that UCA1reduced sensitivity of colorectal
cancer cells. UCA1 sponged miR-204-5p, activating
CREB1 expression, which correlated with poor prognosis
of patients [95]. Qu et fal found that exosome transmitted
lnc ARSR functioned as ceRNA sponging miR-34/miR449
that may promote the expression of AXL and c-MET,
thus inducing sunitinib resistance in renal cancer. It is
believed that lncARSR or AXL/c-MET inhibitors may
have curable potential in renal cancer treatment [96]. Özeş
et al conducted that HOTAIR was highly expressed in
ovarian cancer patients resistant to platinum therapy. The
ectopic expression of HOTAIR could persistently repair
DNA damage attributed by platinum, and it activated
NF-κB signaling. It is suggested that NF-κB/HOTAIR
crosslinking contributed to chemoresistance in ovarian
cancers [30].

the most urgent problem hampering the treatment of
cancer patients. Over past decades, substantial efforts have
been devoted to the investigation of resistance mechanisms
of cancer cells and approaches to reverse such resistance.
Researchers have found that many protein coding genes
such as MDR1, ABCG2, and MRP play critical roles
in cancer cell drug resistance, and some of them have
been used to develop treatment strategies for patients. In
addition, many noncoding RNAs, including microRNAs
and lncRNAs, have also been shown to be involved in this
process [97-99]. Chen et al. reported that low expression
of miR-206 correlates with restored cisplatin resistance
in lung adenocarcinoma tissues, and that miR-206
suppresses cisplatin resistance via inactivating PI3K/AKT
/mTOR signaling pathways [100]. Sun et al. proposed that
upregulation of miR-424 and miR-27a enhanced TRAIL
sensitivity by downregulating PLAG1 [101]. Besides,
lncRNAs have been reported to act as oncogenes or tumor
suppressor genes that can reduce or increase the sensitivity
of cancer cells to anticancer regimens such as tamoxifen,
gefitinib, cisplatin, docetaxel, and 5-Fu. More further
studies are needed to determine whether lncRNA-based
cancer therapy can be applied to clinical practice [102].
Although studies on lncRNA and cancer drug resistance
remain in their infancy, we cannot ignore the potential
of lncRNAs as candidates to develop novel strategies
to reverse the cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy or
molecular targeted therapy. Therefore, more researches
are needed to identify additional lncRNAs related to
cancer cell drug resistance and elucidate their function
and molecular mechanisms, which may place lncRNAs at
center stage in the biology of drug resistance of cancer
cells.

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Cancer is a major cause of human disease-related
death worldwide. Chemotherapy is one of the main
treatment methods for cancer patients, and many newly
developed molecular targeted drugs significantly improve
therapeutic efficacy and prolonged patient survival time.
However, resistance to chemotherapy drugs has become
