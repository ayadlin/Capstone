Abstract

Author Manuscript

Hearing and balance use hair cells in the inner ear to transform mechanical stimuli into electrical
signals1. Mechanical force from sound waves or head movements is conveyed to hair-cell
transduction channels by tip links2,3, fine filaments formed by two atypical cadherins:
protocadherin-15 and cadherin-234,5. These two proteins are products of deafness genes6–10 and
feature long extracellular domains that interact tip-to-tip5,11 in a Ca2+-dependent manner.
However, the molecular architecture of the complex is unknown. Here we combine
crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding experiments to characterize the
cadherin-23 and protocadherin-15 bond. We find a unique cadherin interaction mechanism, with
the two most N-terminal cadherin repeats (EC1+2) of each protein interacting to form an
overlapped, antiparallel heterodimer. Simulations predict that this tip-link bond is mechanically
strong enough to resist forces in hair cells. In addition, the complex becomes unstable upon Ca2+
removal due to increased flexure of Ca2+-free cadherin repeats. Finally, we use structures and
biochemical measurements to understand molecular mechanisms by which deafness mutations
disrupt tip-link function. Overall, our results shed light on the molecular mechanics of hair-cell
sensory transduction and on new interaction mechanisms for cadherins, a large protein family
implicated in tissue and organ morphogenesis12,13, neural connectivity14, and cancer15.
Hair cell mechanotransduction happens within each bundle of stereocilia (Fig. 1a), which is
deflected by mechanical stimulation1. Deflection results in tension applied to tip links,
protein filaments linking the tip of each stereocilium to its tallest neighbour2,3. The tip links,

acting in series with an elastic “gating spring,” pull open transduction channels1. Recently,
protocadherin-15 and cadherin-23, which feature exceptionally long extracellular domains
with 11 and 27 extracellular cadherin (EC) repeats (Fig. 1b), were shown to form the tip
link4,5. To elucidate the tip-link heterophilic molecular bond between protocadherin-15 and
cadherin-23, we determined the crystallographic structure of their interacting N-termini (Fig.
1c; results summary in Supplementary Fig. 1). Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of corefolded protein fragments comprising the EC1+2 repeats of protocadherin-15 and EC1+2 of
cadherin-23 (referred to here as pcdh-15 and cdh-23, respectively) showed a monodisperse
peak with the two protein fragments interacting in solution (Supplementary Fig. 2a). The
complex crystallized in two packing arrangements and two independent models were fully
refined (S1a–S1b and S2, respectively; Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3).

Author Manuscript

The structures show that pcdh-15 and cdh-23 form an overlapping and antiparallel
heterodimer (pcdh-15+cdh-23; Figs 1c, f and g). The interaction resembles an “extended
handshake” and involves repeats EC1 and EC2 from both proteins. The overall fold of
pcdh-15 and cdh-23 matched the well-known Greek-key motif of classical cadherins
(Supplementary Fig. 4). As expected, three Ca2+ ions are found in a canonical arrangement
(sites 1, 2, and 3) at the linker region between repeats EC1 and EC2 of each protein (Fig.
1c,e). However, several novel structural features within pcdh-15 and cdh-23 enable the
handshake interaction.

Author Manuscript

Pcdh-15 has an elongated N-terminus clamped by an intramolecular disulfide bond (Fig.
1d), which is followed by a conserved RXGPP motif that forms a rigid and bulky loop
(Supplementary Fig. 5a&b). This RXGPP loop, within strand A of protocadherin-15 EC1, is
tucked against the narrow wrist of the adjacent cdh-23’s linker region (Fig. 1c). Similarly,
cdh-23 has an elongated N-terminus, stabilized at the tip by Ca2+-binding site 016,17, which
is followed by a bulky 310 helix within strand A that sits at the narrow wrist of the adjacent
pcdh-15’s linker (Fig. 1c). Thus, the pcdh-15+cdh-23 interface exploits unique structural
protrusions within strand A of each EC1 repeat, which in turn are stabilized by a disulfide
bond and a Ca2+-binding site and lead to two main areas of interaction described below.

Author Manuscript

The pcdh-15+cdh-23 heterophilic interface differs from the strand-exchanged or X-dimer
homophilic interfaces of classical cadherins18–20. Furthermore, this interface is not directly
mediated by Ca2+ as previously speculated16,17. However, several factors indicate that this is
a robust interface. The buried surface area is ~1,000 Å2 per protomer (see Supplementary
Tables 1&2), similar to that of classical cadherin interfaces (850 Å2 and 1,270 Å2 for type I
and type II, respectively). The interface is amphiphilic (Supplementary Fig. 6); all its
residues are highly conserved in mouse, human, and chicken homologues and none are
predicted to be glycosylated (Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 7). Finally, the same interface
was observed in two different crystal lattices, so it is unlikely to represent unphysiological
crystal packing interactions.
To further validate the pcdh-15+cdh-23 interface we used isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) and site-directed mutagenesis. The stoichiometry of the wild-type complex was
determined to be N = 0.88 ± 0.1, consistent with the one-to-one crystallographic
arrangement (Fig. 1). The measured dissociation constant was KD = 2.9 ± 0.4 μM (T = 10

°C, ΔH = 7084 ± 233 cal/mol, ΔS = 50.4 ± 1.1 cal/mol/deg, two trials; Fig. 2a,b and
Supplementary Discussion). The tip link is thought to be a heterotetramer of parallel
protocadherin-15 and cadherin-23 dimers5 (Fig. 1b). However, our biochemical and
crystallographic data do not show homophilic binding of cdh-23 or pcdh-15, suggesting that
parallel dimerization is mediated by repeats other than EC1+2. If so, the binding affinity for
the heterotetramer is expected to be significantly higher21.

Author Manuscript

The “extended handshake” features two main areas of interaction. The first one is located at
and above pcdh-15’s RXGPP loop and centers on Y8, P19 and I108 in pcdh-15, and L145
and Q187 in cdh-23 (Figs 1g, 2d–f). The second, located between the RXGPP loop and
cdh-23’s 310 helix, involves I22, R113 and V115 in pcdh-15 along with Y16 and Q98 in
cdh-23 (Figs. 1g &2d,g). To test the two interaction areas we introduced mutations predicted
to disrupt them: I22A in pcdh-15 (pcdh-15I22A) and L145G in cdh-23 (cdh-23L145G; Fig.
2d,e,g). SEC confirmed proper folding and structural integrity of the mutant proteins. ITC
experiments, testing binding with either one or both mutant partners, showed decreased
affinity for each single-mutant complex (pcdh-15I22A+cdh-23, KD > 100μM;
pcdh-15+cdh-23L145G, KD > 30 μM), and complete lack of interaction for the double-mutant
complex (pcdh-15I22A+cdh-23L145G; Fig. 2a,b,d,e,g and Supplementary Figs 2, 8&9).
Likewise, SEC of pcdh-15+cadherin-23 EC1 repeats alone did not show complex formation
(Supplementary Fig. 2b). Taken together, these results show that the interface observed in
the crystals is consistent with the interface observed in solution.

Author Manuscript

Does the interface have the properties expected for a tip-link bond? Tip links are regularly
subjected to (and must withstand) forces ranging from 10 to 100 pN, both in vivo and in
physiological experiments. While SEC and ITC experiments provide a characterization of
the bond in thermodynamic equilibrium, they do not probe its response to mechanical force.
To determine whether the pcdh-15+cdh-23 interface is mechanically strong we used steered
molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations (Methods and Supplementary Table 3). Force was
applied to the C-terminus of each protomer to induce complex dissociation (Fig. 3a). In all
SMD simulations of pcdh-15+cdh-23 with Ca2+, unbinding was observed without unfolding
of repeats. Partial rupture of the binding interface at contacts formed by residues
pcdh-15T106 – cdh-23L145 and pcdh-15R84 – cdh-23N96 was followed by sliding of the 310
helix in strand A of cadherin-23 EC1 over the pcdh-15 RXGPP loop, and simultaneous
rupture of a salt bridge between pcdh-15R113 and cdh-23E77 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary
Discussion, Figs 10, 11, and Movies I&II). Simulations performed using different stretching
speeds, initial conditions, and thermodynamic ensembles revealed a similar scenario with at
least one force peak of > 400 pN associated with complex unbinding (Fig. 3c,d and
Supplementary Figs 10&11).

Author Manuscript

Unbinding forces followed the well-known dependence on stretching speed22, with less
force required when the stretch was slower. The slowest speed used in our simulations
matched the measured velocity of the basilar membrane induced by loud sound23 as well as
speeds of mechanical stimulators used in ex-vivo electrophysiological experiments24 (see
Supplementary Discussion). In all our simulations the pcdh-15+cdh-23 interface was
stronger than that of the classical C-cadherin interface pulled under identical conditions
(Supplementary Fig. 12). Furthermore, the predicted force required to unbind parallel

complexes was almost double that required to unbind a single pcdh-15+cdh-23 complex
(Supplementary Figs 12b,c), which may correspond to the actual force that heterotetrameric
tip links can withstand in vivo before rupture due to large mechanical stimuli, e.g., loud
sound.

The integrity of tip links in hair cells is Ca2+-dependent3, yet Ca2+ does not directly
participate in the binding interface. We therefore determined whether the pcdh-15+cdh-23
complex is disrupted by Ca2+ removal using SEC experiments in the presence of EGTA
(Fig. 4a). The cdh-23 fragment by itself did not show changes in its elution volume, while
pcdh-15 in the presence of EGTA showed a shifted elution trace. Importantly, the
pcdh-15+cdh-23 complex was disrupted by addition of EGTA: its elution trace did not
match that in the presence of Ca2+, but rather corresponded to the summation of the
individual components’ traces without the shift in elution volume that indicates interaction.
The complex used for crystallization is thus Ca2+-dependent at equilibrium, in line with
what is known about the full-length protocadherin-15 and cadherin-23 proteins and the tip
link3,5. To understand the basis of the Ca2+ dependence, we performed microsecond-long
MD simulations of the Ca2+-free complex. These suggest a molecular mechanism: removal
of Ca2+ is predicted to cause dissociation indirectly, through entropic stress (see
Supplementary Discussion, Supplementary Figs 13 & 14, and Movies III, IV & V), as
observed for other cadherins25.

Over 40 missense mutations associated with deafness in humans or mice target the
extracellular domains of protocadherin-15 and cadherin-23. Most modify Ca2+-binding
residues26. Three human mutations causing inherited deafness (pcdh-15D157G27,
cdh-23D101G28, and pcdh-15R113G27) and one mouse mutation that accelerates progressive
hearing loss (cdh-23S47P29) are located within the crystallized pcdh-15+cdh-23 complex
(Supplementary Figs 1c & 15). Our data provide a structural context to interpret their effect
on tip link function. We also constructed all four mutants to test formation of heterophilic
complexes in vitro with ITC and SEC, finding that they each affect the pcdh-15+cdh-23
complex in different ways. Cdh-23D101G, cdh-23S47P, and pcdh-15R113G refolded well as
assessed by SEC, whereas pcdh-15D157G did not and its analysis was not possible. The
D101G and S47P cdh-23 fragments crystallized in complex with pcdh-15 and show only
minor changes in the interface and in binding (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Discussion and
Supplementary Fig. 16). On the other hand, pcdh-15R113G showed impaired binding to
cdh-23.

Author Manuscript

Residue pcdh-15R113 is of particular interest because it is at the interface between pcdh-15
and cdh-23 (Fig. 2h). Mutation R113G, causing human non-syndromic deafness DFNB2327,
eliminates the long arginine sidechain that flanks the hydrophobic core of this interface and
disrupts its integrated hydrogen-bond network. SEC of either co-refolded or independently
refolded proteins showed no evidence of pcdh-15R113G+cdh-23 complex formation (Fig. 4b
and Supplementary Fig. 2). Furthermore, ITC experiments show impaired binding and
indicate an estimated KD at least an order of magnitude larger than that measured for wildtype pcdh-15+cdh-23 (>20 μM, Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 8). In other work, R113G
impaired binding of full-length protocadherin-15 and cadherin-23 in vitro5, as well as
binding of protein fragments to hair-cell tip links ex vivo11. Together, these observations

help validate the interface observed in our crystal structure and indicate that this mutation
causes deafness by directly interfering with binding between cadherin-23 and
protocadherin-15. Residual interactions detected in ITC experiments may explain why
vestibular function is not affected in human subjects carrying this mutation27.

Author Manuscript

In summary (Supplementary Fig. 1), the pcdh-15+cdh-23 structure provides the first view of
a heterophilic cadherin complex, revealing a novel “extended handshake” interface that
simulations predict to be mechanically stronger than required to resist forces produced by
moderate sound. The structure helps explain the Ca2+ sensitivity of the tip link, and the
etiology of certain inherited deafnesses. For other cadherins, both the existence of
heterophilic cadherin bonds and the possibility of interdigitation have been debated20. While
protocadherin-15 and cadherin-23 are rather specialized members of the cadherin family, the
overlapping heterophilic complex formed by these molecules suggests structural
determinants that could also favor this type of interactions in related members of the
cadherin family, such as the fat3 and fat4 cadherins that control neuronal morphology and
morphogenesis30 (Supplementary Discussion).

Cloning, expression, and purification of protocadherin-15 and cadherin-23 repeats

Clones of mouse cadherin-23 repeats EC1 and EC1+2 were previously described16.
Numbering corresponds to mouse cadherin-23 and protocadherin-15 without their signal
sequences. Mouse protocadherin-15 EC1+2 comprising residues Q1 to D233 (Q27 to D259
in NP_001136218.1) was subcloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of the vector pET21a (Cterminal His-tag). The signal sequence was replaced by a methionine at position 0. The
R113G, D157G, and I22A mutations in pcdh-15, as well as the L145G and S47P mutations
in cdh-23 were generated using the QuikChange Lightning mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All
constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Pcdh-15, pcdh-15R113G, pcdh-15D157G,
pcdh-15I22A, cdh-23, cdh-23D101G, cdh-23S47P, and cadherin-23 EC1 were expressed
independently in BL21CodonPlus(DE3)-RIPL (Stratagene) cultured in LB and induced at
OD600=0.6 with 100 μM IPTG at room temperature for ~16 hrs. Cells were lysed by
sonication in denaturing buffer (20 mM HEPES at pH 7.5, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride
[GuHCl], 10 mM CaCl2, 20 mM imidazole at pH 7.0). The cleared lysates were loaded onto
Ni-sepharose (GE Healthcare) and eluted with denaturing buffer supplemented with 500
mM imidazole. Wild-type and mutant Pcdh-15 protein fragments were reduced by adding 1
mM DTT and incubating at 37°C for ~30 min. Purified and denatured samples were mixed
(pcdh-15+cdh-23, pcdh-15R113G+cdh-23, pcdh-15D157G+cdh-23, pcdh-15+cdh-23D101G,
pcdh-15+cdh-23S47P, pcdh-15+cadherin-23 EC1, pcdh-15R113G+cadherin-23 EC1, and
pcdh-15I22A+cadherin-23 EC1) and co-refolded in six steps at 4°C using MWCO 2000
membranes (protocol adapted from ref 31). First, the mixture was dialyzed for 24 hrs against
D buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM CaCl2) with 6 M GuHCl, followed by two 24-hr
dialyses against D buffer with 3 and 2 M GuHCl, respectively. The last three steps consisted
of 12-hr dialyses against D buffer with decreasing GuHCl concentration (1, 0.5, and 0 M)
plus 400 mM L-Arg and 375 μM GSSG. Refolded protein used for crystallization was
further purified in two consecutive size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) experiments with

mM KCl, with 10 and 1 mM CaCl2, respectively. Predicted and apparent molecular weights
(SDS-PAGE) for pcdh-15 and cdh-23 fragments were 27.5/37 kDa and 23.8/25 kDa,
respectively. Identity of pcdh-15 was confirmed through N-terminal sequencing.
Crystallization, data collection, and structure determination

Author Manuscript

Crystals were grown by vapor diffusion at 4°C by mixing equal volumes of protein (5–10
mg/ml) and reservoir solution of (0.1 M MES pH 6.5, 8% w/v PEG 8000) for S1a, (0.1 M
MES pH 6.5, 15% w/v PEG 550 MME) for S1b, (0.1 M HEPES pH 7.5, 10% w/v PEG
8000) for S2, (0.1M MES pH 6.5, 8% w/v PEG 20000) for S3, and (0.1M MES pH 6.5, 12%
PEG 4000) for S4. All crystals were cryoprotected in reservoir solution plus 25% glycerol
and cryo-cooled in N2. X-ray diffraction data were collected as indicated in Supplementary
Tables 1&2 and processed with HKL200032. Structures were determined by molecular
replacement using the cdh-23 structure (pdb code 2wcp) and a pcdh-15 homology model
(based on the same cdh-23 structure) as search models with Phaser33. Model building was
done using COOT34 and restrained TLS refinement using REFMAC535. The final models
include residues M0 to E207 (cdh-23) and M0 to H237 (pcdh-15) for S1a, M0 to E207
(cdh-23) and Q1 to H236 (pcdh-15) for S1b, M0 to E207 (cdh-23 A and B) and Q1/Y2 to
H237 (pcdh-15 C and D) for S2, M0 to D205 (cdh-23D101G and cdh-23S47P) and M0 to
H236/H237 (pcdh-15) for S3 and S4. Data collection and refinement statistics are provided
in Supplementary Tables 1&2. Coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank
with entry codes 4apx (S1a), 4axw (S1b), 4aq8 (S2), 4aqa (S3), and 4aqe (S4).
Isothermal titration calorimetry

ITC experiments were carried out using a MicroCal ITC200 calorimeter and designed
following guidelines from Thomson and Ladbury36 and the manufacturer’s manual. Wild
type, I22A and R113G pcdh-15 fragments were co-refolded with cadherin-23 EC1 as
described above, and subsequent SEC was performed on a Superdex75 column with 20 mM
TrisHCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM CaCl2. Fractions with pure pcdh-15,
pcdh-15I22A, and pcdh-15R113G were collected, concentrated (to 100 to 150 μM) and placed
in the calorimeter’s sample cell. Similarly, wild type, L145G, D101G, and S47P cdh-23
fragments were refolded as previously described16, concentrated (to 1 to 2 mM), buffermatched through SEC, and then used as titrants. Protein concentrations were measured using
samples’ absorbances at 280 nm and theoretical extinction coefficients. All experiments
were performed at 10°C, as no signal was detected and the protein tended to be unstable at
room temperature. In a typical experiment, an initial 0.5-μl injection (disregarded in
analyses) was followed by fifteen 2.44-μl injections of titrant (Δt = 3 min). Experiments and
controls with each combination of fragments were repeated at least once (Supplementary
Fig. 8). Fittings and binding constants were obtained using the MicroCal Software, a model
with one set of sites, and blank-subtracted data. Fitting parameters are reported for saturating
sigmoidal curves as the average±s.d. of two independent experiments. Attempts to obtain
saturating sigmoidal curves and precise KDs for mutant proteins were hampered by
aggregation of protein samples at the high concentration required (>2 mM).

SEC of co-refolded proteins (pcdh-15+cdh-23, pcdh-15R113G+cdh-23,
pcdh-15D157G+cdh-23, pcdh-15+cdh-23D101G, pcdh-15+cdh-23S47P, pcdh-15+cadherin-23
EC1, and pcdh-15R113G+cadherin-23 EC1) was performed on a Superdex75 16/60 column
with 20 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl and 1 mM CaCl2 (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Fractions with pure cdh-23 (excess from pcdh-15+cdh-23), pcdh-15 (from
pcdh-15+cadherin-23 EC1), and pcdh-15R113G (from pcdh-15R113G+cadherin-23 EC1) were
collected, concentrated (~0.5 mg/ml), and used for subsequent analytical SEC (Fig 4a,b) on
a Superdex200 PC3.2/3.0 column equilibrated with the same buffer (plus 5 mM EGTA
when indicated). Experiments were performed at 4°C using a 10 μl loop and a 50 μl/min
flow rate on an AKTAmicro system equipped with a fused silica capillary tubing for
collection of 40 μl fractions. EGTA was added to individual or pre-mixed concentrated
samples followed by a 1 hr mild shaking prior to SEC.

Simulated systems
The psfgen, solvate, and autoionize VMD37 plug-ins were used to build all systems
(Supplementary Table 3) as previously reported16. Most of the pcdh-15+cdh-23 complex
simulations used structure S1b (which we determined first) except simulations SN9 to SN13
(which used higher resolution structure S1a; Supplementary Tables 1 and 3). Structures with
non-native N- and C-terminal tails were modified back to native sequences. Systems without
bound Ca2+ were prepared by replacing Ca2+ atoms with K+.
Molecular dynamics simulations using NAMD

Author Manuscript

MD simulations were performed using NAMD 2.738, the CHARMM27 force field for
proteins with CMAP correction39,40, and the TIP3P model for water. Simulation parameters
were as in ref 16, except for simulations SNA7 and SNC6, in which a multiple-time-step
scheme was used with electrostatic interactions evaluated every other time step. Parameters
for Ca2+ were from ref 41. Each system was energy-minimized, then equilibrated in the
constant number, pressure, and temperature ensemble (NpT), and the resulting state used to
perform subsequent Anton or SMD simulations42. All simulations used T=310 K.
Coordinates of all atoms were saved for analysis every picosecond. Constant velocity
stretching simulations used the SMD method and NAMD Tcl Forces interface16,43.
Molecular dynamics simulations using Anton

Author Manuscript

Anton is a massively parallel special-purpose machine for molecular dynamics
simulations44. Systems pre-equilibrated in NAMD (1.1 ns, T=310 K) were converted to the
Anton-compatible Maestro format using the convertNAMDtoMaestro.py script provided by
NRBSC/PSC. Anton and NAMD simulations used the same force field. Hydrogen atoms
were constrained with SHAKE. Restraints were applied to Cα atoms of residues 121, 173,
and 205 of cdh-23 to avoid rotation of the complex and contact between periodic images. A
multiple-time-step scheme was used with interactions evaluated every 2.5 fs, except for nonbonded interactions computed every other time step. A set of cutoff radii and parameters for
evaluation of electrostatic forces was automatically generated for each simulated system
using the guess_anton_config script. Simulations were performed in either the constant

the constant number, pressure, and temperature ensemble (NpT) using the Berendsen
thermostat/barostat. Center of mass motion was removed. Coordinates of all atoms were
saved for analysis every 50 (NpT) or 200 (NVT) picoseconds. Anton simulations are
restricted in size (<120,000 atoms) and cannot incorporate SMD-like forces, hence the use
of complementary NAMD simulations.
Analysis tools

Author Manuscript

The Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblies (PISA) server was used to analyze complex
interfaces45 and identify residues shown in Figs 1g and 2d. The VMD “measure SASA”
command was used to determine interface area throughout simulations with a probe radius
of 1.4 Å. Interface area was defined as the difference in total solvent-accessible surface
areas for each isolated protomer and for the complex divided by two. Glycosylation sites
were predicted using OGPET46, NetNGlyc47 and NetOGlyc48. Intradomain RMSD and
interdomain flexing were analyzed using DynDom49. Regression fits to data points of
maximum force peaks versus stretching speeds were performed using a logarithmic
expression of the form y = a + b log x. Plots and curve fits were prepared using xmgrace.
Molecular images in this paper were created with the molecular graphics program VMD37,
except for Supplementary Fig. 5 which used PyMOL (Schrödinger, LLC).

Mechanical strength of the pcdh-15+cdh-23 complex probed by steered molecular dynamics
(SMD) simulations. a, Snapshots of pcdh-15 (purple) and cdh-23 (blue) unbinding during
simulation SNA7 (Supplementary Table 3). The complex is shown in both cartoon and
surface representations at the beginning, and in surface representation at indicated time
points. Force was applied to the C-termini of both protomers (Supplementary Movies I&II).
Green arrows point to broken interfaces. b, Region of gray box in panel (a), showing
interacting residues during unbinding. c, Force applied to one C-terminus versus distance
between C-termini ends of pcdh-15 and cdh-23. Different traces correspond to independent
simulations performed at stretching speeds of 10 (blue and black), 1 (light and dark green),
0.1 (cyan, 1-ns running average shown in black), and 0.02 nm/ns (magenta, 1-ns running
average). Snapshots in (a) are indicated by arrowheads. d, Maximum force-peak values vs.
stretching speed for unbinding simulations of pcdh-15+cdh-23 started after a 1-ns or 1-μs
equilibration (light green, SN2 to SN6; dark green, SNA2 to SNA7; cyan, SN10 to SN13).
Simulations SN2-SN6 and SNA2-SNA7 used the S1b structure and SN10-SN13 used S1a;
unbinding forces for all three sets were equivalent.

Pcdh-15+cdh-23 complex formation, its Ca2+-dependence, and the role of the deafness
mutation R113G, probed using analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Individual
traces represent independent experiments. a, top, SEC traces for pcdh-15 and cdh-23 with
Ca2+ (red and blue) or with 5 mM EGTA (purple and cyan). A shift upon Ca2+ removal by
EGTA was observed for pcdh-15 (purple vs. red curves). middle, SEC traces for
pcdh-15+cdh-23 in the presence of Ca2+ (light green) or 5 mM EGTA (dark green). The
summation of a purple and a cyan curve from above is shown as a dashed line. The EGTAtreated complex behaved as the sum of its EGTA-treated components, indicating Ca2+dependent complex formation. bottom, Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE of eluted fractions
from EGTA-treated proteins. b, top, SEC traces for mutant pcdh-15R113G alone (maroon),
and mixed with cdh-23 (orange). Wild-type proteins from (a) are shown for comparison.
bottom, Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE of eluted fractions aligned to chromatogram. A
reproducible shift in elution volume was observed for the wild-type (green) but not for the
mutant mixture (pcdh-15R113G+cdh-23; orange). The shifted peak (1.61 ml) contained both
proteins (1.56 to 1.64 ml fractions).
