Abstract
Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), a Bcl-2–like antiapoptotic
protein, plays a role in cell immortalization and chemoresistance in a number of human malignancies. A peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase, Pin1 is involved in many cellular
events, such as cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, and
differentiation through isomerizing prophosphorylated substrates. It has been reported that down-regulation of Pin1
induces apoptosis, and that Erk phosphorylates and upregulates Mcl-1; however, the underlying mechanisms for the
two phenomena are not clear yet. Here, we showed that Pin 1
stabilizes Mcl-1, which is required for Mcl-1 posphorylation by
Erk. First, we found expression of Mcl-1 and Pin1 were
positively correlated and associated with poor survival in
human breast cancer. We then showed that Erk could
phosphorylate Mcl-1 at two consensus residues, Thr 92 and
163, which is required for the association of Mcl-1 and Pin1,
resulting in stabilization of Mcl-1. Moreover, Pin1 is also
required for the up-regulation of Mcl-1 by Erk activation.
Based on this newly identified mechanism of Mcl-1 stabilization, two strategies were used to overcome Mcl-1–mediated
chemoresistance: inhibiting Erk by Sorafenib, an approved
clinical anticancer drug, or knocking down Pin1 by using a
SiRNA technique. In conclusion, the current report not only
unravels a novel mechanism to link Erk/Pin1 pathway and
Mcl-1–mediated chemoresistance but also provides a plausible
combination therapy, Taxol (Paclitaxel) plus Sorafenib, which
was shown to be effective in killing breast cancer cells. [Cancer

(MAPK) triggers a series of cascade events that govern cell
transformation, differentiation, proliferation, and survival (3, 4).
There are f30% of tumors that harbor active mutants of the RAS
oncoprotein, and a downstream effector of RAS, RAF, is also
frequently mutated in tumors (5, 6). Together, the active RAS-RAFMAP/ERK kinase (MEK) pathway inevitably accounts for a
hallmark of malignant phenotypes: abnormal cell growth, invasion,
and angiogenesis. Therefore, interruption of the RAS-RAF-MEK
cascade has become a primary target for cancer therapy. Small
molecule inhibitors targeting RAF and MEK kinase have shown
promising results in cancer treatment. For instance, Sorafenib (BAY
43-9006), a multikinase inhibitor, was approved by the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for treating patients with renal cell
carcinoma (7). Sorafenib was initially identified as a RAF kinase
inhibitor, and later, it was found to be able to inhibit the MAPK
pathway in multiple cancer cell lines. In human xenograft models
including ovarian, colon, lung, pancreatic, and melanoma,
Sorafenib inhibits tumor growth through inhibition of either
MAPK signaling or angiogenesis (8, 9). Thus far, the molecular
mechanisms involving Sorafenib-induced apoptosis are not wellcharacterized.
Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), a Bcl-2–like antiapoptotic
protein containing three BH domains (BH1-3) without a defined
BH4 domain at the NH2 terminus, was originally identified in
differentiating myeloid cells (10). Mcl-1 also has a transmembrane
domain at the COOH terminus as a localization signal to
translocate to various intracellular membranes, especially to the
outer mitochondrial membrane (11). Mcl-1 can be rapidly degraded
by certain death-inducing signals, but it is able to be readily
induced by diverse survival cytokines such as epidermal growth
factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, granulocyt-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin 3 through phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/Akt, MEK/MAPK, or Janus-activated kinase/
STAT signaling cascades (12, 13). The rapid induction and
degradation of Mcl-1 suggests that Mcl-1 can serve as a sensor of
acute environmental changes to balance between cell survival and
death, which is an essential factor for embryogenesis and for
maintenance of the development of both B and T lymphocytes
(14, 15). Furthermore, increased Mcl-1 expression may enhance the
general well-being of cells, not only by promoting short-term
viability in a wide range of cells but also by contributing to longterm immortalization and tumorigenesis in certain cells (16–18).
Meanwhile, it is well-documented that overexpression of Mcl-1
plays a role in chemoresistance in a number of human

ylates Mcl-1 and then recruits E3 ligase h-Trcp to degrade Mcl-1,
leading to apoptosis and tumor suppression. Through this
mechanism, GSK-3h enhances chemosensitization (20, 21). However, it is still not clearly understood how Mcl-1 is stabilized in
cancer cells.
Pin1, a recently identified peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase
(PPIase), has two domains: a PPIase domain at its COOH terminus
responsible for isomerization and a WW domain at the NH2
terminus, which functions as a binding element specific for pSer/
Thr-Pro motifs (22–25). Through these two domains, Pin1 binds to
and isomerizes specific pSer/Thr-Pro motifs and catalytically
induces conformational changes after phosphorylation. Such
conformational changes can have profound effects on the function
of many Pin1 substrates, such as p53, cyclin D1, C-Jun, nuclear
factor-nB, C-myc, E2F, h-catenin, and APP, thereby playing an
important role in many cellular events, such as cell cycle
progression, transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and cell
proliferation and differentiation (26–32). It has been reported that
down-regulation of Pin1 induces apoptosis (33–35), but the
mechanism is not clearly understood. It is also known that Erk
phosphorylates Mcl-1 and up-regulates its expression (36), and that
the phosphorylation site of Erk is pSer/Thr-Pro, which is also the
consensus motif recognized by Pin1. In the current study, we
showed that Pin1 stabilizes the antiapoptotic protein, Mcl-1, which
is activated by Erk/MAPK pathway.

performed with an optimal ratio of DNA to liposome based on prior
experiments (21). SiRNA-mediated down-regulation of Pin1 was performed
by transfecting SMART pool–specific or nonspecific control pool doublestranded RNA oligonucleotides (Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen). The percentage of surviving cells upon chemo-drug treatment
was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The apoptotic cells were assessed by a flow cytometry
assay (FACS) as previously described (20). Briefly, trypsinized cells were
washed with PBS and then fixed with 70% ethanol overnight at 20jC.

Transduction Labs); HA-tag, Myc-tag, and Tubulin (Sigma); phospho-Erk
and Erk (Upstate Biotechnology); and rabbit anti-Pin1(Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). For quantification of the Western analysis, the density of
each band was quantified by Quantity One software; the background of each
selected area (band) was automatically calculated and then deducted by the
software. For In vitro kinase assays, purified glutathione S-transferase
(GST)-Mcl-1 protein was incubated with activated Erk1 (Upstate) in the
presence of 50 mmol/L ATP in kinase buffer for 30 min at 30jC. Reaction
products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then visualized by autoradiography.
Immunohistochemical staining. For immunohistochemical staining of
human breast cancer tissue samples, each sample was stained with specific
antibodies as indicated and scored by an H-score method that combines the
values of immunoreaction intensity and the percentage of tumor cell
staining. Briefly, the immunoreactivity of Pin1 and Mcl-1 were ranked into 2
groups according to the percentage of the positive tumor cells: positive
(+, >10%), and negative ( and +, <10%). One hundred and one surgically
resected human breast cancer specimens were collected from the
Department of Pathology, Shanghai East Breast Disease Hospital, P. R.
China.
Statistical analysis. The linear regression analysis was used to analyze
the correlation between Pin1 expression and level of Mcl-1 in multiple cell
lines. The m2 test was used to analyze the relation between Mcl-1 level with
Pin1 in 101 primary breast cancer tissues. Kaplan-Meier curves for the
overall survival of 101 primary breast cancer patients were plotted and
compared. Log-rank test was used to evaluate the difference in expression
between three groups of Mcl-1 and Pin1 as indicated with regard to overall
survival. Statistical analysis and graphs were performed with SPSS software,
and the level of significance was set at 0.05.

Results
Expression of Mcl-1 and Pin1 is positively correlated and
associated with poor survival in human breast cancer. To
investigate the pathological relevance of the relationship between
Pin1 and Mcl-1 expression in vivo, we analyzed these 2 proteins in
101 human breast cancer tissue samples. Immunohistochemical
staining showed that there was a positive correlation between
the levels of Mcl-1 and Pin1 in human breast cancer samples
(P = 0.043; Fig. 1A and B). We then compared the expression
of Mcl-1 and Pin1 in tumor tissues with the patients’ survival
follow-up. The results indicated that the patients’ survival was
decreased significantly with the coexpression of Mcl-1 and Pin1,
whereas negative Mcl-1 and Pin1 expression was significantly
associated with an increase of overall survival (Fig. 1C). Thus, the
expression level of Mcl-1 and Pin1 may be a potential candidate
for a predictive marker of poor prognosis in breast cancer
patients.
Pin1 stabilizes Mcl-1. To validate the relevance of the
relationship between Pin1 and Mcl-1 expression observed in
human breast cancer samples, we compared the expression of
the two proteins in a panel of 24 cancer cell lines of breast, ovarian,
pancreas, colon, and lung. As expected, Mcl-1 expression was
significantly correlated with Pin1 expression (Fig. 2A). To further
investigate whether Pin1 may affect Mcl-1 level, we first examined
the Mcl-1 level in MEF wild-type (WT) cell and Pin1 knockout MEF

Figure 2. Pin1 stabilizes Mcl-1. A, the expression of Mcl-1 and Pin1 were studied in the indicated cancer cell lines (left ). The densities of Mcl-1 and Pin1 were
quantitated using Quantity One software and then were analyzed by linear regression (right ). Expression levels of Mcl-1 and Pin1 were normalized by tubulin.
B, lysates of MEF cells, Pin / MEF, or GSK-3h knockout MEF cells were subjected to Western blotting to detect endogenous Mcl-1. C, WT Pin1 or Pin1-R68A,

endogenous Mcl-1. D, 293T cells were transfected with Mcl-1-WT, GSK-3h-CA, Pin1-WT, or R68A mutant as indicated for 48 h. Expression of Myc-Mcl-1, HA-GSK-3h,
and HA-Pin1 were then analyzed by Western blotting.

(Pin / MEF) cell. The results showed that Mcl-1 level was
decreased in Pin / MEF cells (Fig. 2B) and was recovered by
introducing WT Pin1 expression into Pin / MEF cell. However,
dominant-negative Pin1 (R68,69A Pin1), which lost its PPIase
function, did not increase Mcl-1 expression compared with WT
Pin1 (Fig. 2C), indicating that Pin1 may stabilize Mcl-1. As GSK-3h
is known to degrade Mcl-1, we cotransfected GSK-3h with either
WT Pin1 or R68,69A Pin 1 in 293T cells and showed that only the
WT Pin1 counteracted GSK-3h–mediated Mcl-1 degradation to
further support the notion that Pin1 stabilizes Mcl-1 (Fig. 2D).
Additional studies confirmed that Pin1 inhibits GSK-3h–induced
ubiquitination of Mcl-1 (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Pin1 associates with and stabilizes Mcl-1, which depends on
Mcl-1 phosphorylation at two residues by Erk. Because Erk has
been shown to up-regulate Mcl-1, and the phosphorylation site of
Erk is pSer/Thr-Pro motif and is also recognized by Pin1, we
investigated whether Erk may play a role in the Pin1-mediated
stabilization of Mcl-1. First, the results of Mass Spectrometry
analysis indicated that Erk phosphorylated Mcl-1 not only at
residue Thr 163 but also at residue Thr 92 (Fig. 3A). To further
validate the mass spectrometry data, we then constructed mutants
in which the two potential threonine phosphorylation sites of
Mcl-1 were changed to alanine. We found that the double mutation
of Mcl-1-92/163AA could completely abrogate the phosphorylation

Figure 4. Pin1 associates with and stabilizes Mcl-1, which depends on Mcl-1 phosphorylation by Erk. A, Mcl-1 (Myc-tag) was transfected into 293T cells with WT
Pin1 or WW domain mutant Pin1-W34A (HA-tag), and then Mcl-1 or Pin1 were IP from transfected 293T cell lysates (1,000 Ag per lane) and subjected to Western
blotting. B, Mcl-1 (Myc-tag) was transfected into 293T cells with WT Pin1 or Pin1-92/163AA mutant (HA-tag), and then Pin1 was IP from transfected 293T cell
lysates (1,000 Ag per lane) and subjected to Western blotting. C, HeLa cell (left ) and MCF7 cell (right ) were treated with mitogen activator TPA alone or with
MAPK inhibitor U0126 for 4 h, and then endogenous Mcl-1 was IP from treated cell lysates and subjected to Western blotting. D, Mcl-1-WT, Mcl-1-92/163AA, or
Mcl-1-92/163DD mutant was transfected into 293T cells, and cells were then treated with cycloheximide (20 mmol/L) for the indicated times. Cell lysates were analyzed
by Western blotting against Myc-Mcl-1. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to Western blot analyses, as determined by comparing amounts of tubulin (top ).
Densitometry results for Mcl-1-WT, Mcl-1-92/163AA, or Mcl-1-92/163DD after cycloheximide treatment were plotted, and the half-lives of Mcl-1-WT, Mcl-1-92/163AA,
and Mcl-1-92/163DD were determined (bottom ).

Figure 5. Down-regulation of Pin1 induces apoptosis and chemosensitization,
which can be overridden by expression of Mcl-1. A, MCF7 and HeLa cells were
transfected with siRNA against Pin1 for 48 h and then treated with mitogen
activator TPA for 4 h; harvested cell lysates were then subjected to Western
blotting to detect Mcl-1 and Pin1. B, SiRNA against Pin1 was transfected alone
or with Mcl-1 into MCF7 cells for 72 h, and then the percentage of apoptotic
cells was determined by FACS. C, MCF7 cells transfected with siRNA against
Pin1 alone or with Mcl-1 were treated with apoptotic drugs 5-Fu (10 Ag/mL)

cell viability without chemo-drug treatment were defined as 100% control.

of Mcl-1 by Erk (Fig. 3B). Between the two single mutations, 92A
and 163A, Mcl-1-163A exhibited better inhibition of phosphorylation by Erk, indicating that 163Thr could be the major
phosphorylation site of Mcl-1 by Erk (Fig. 3B).
Next, we tested the association between Mcl-1 and Pin1, and the
results of IP showed that WT Pin1 but not the WW domain mutant

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (15). August 1, 2008

Pin1-W34A is able to bind with Mcl-1 (Fig. 4A). The mutant of Mcl1 92/163AA, which cannot be phosphorylated by Erk, dramatically
decreased its association with Pin1. However, the mutant of Mcl-164A, of which Thr 64 is recently identified as a CDK phosphorylation site to stabilize Mcl-1 (38), still strongly associated with
Pin1 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that Mcl-1 phosphorylation at 92/163
residues by Erk may be required for association of Mcl-1 and Pin1.
Furthermore, the results are supported by the fact that Erk
activation by TPA, a mitogen activator, enhanced the association of
Mcl-1 and Pin1 and inhibition of Erk activation by U0126, a MAPK
inhibitor, significantly decreased their binding (Fig. 4C). Because
the two phosphorylation sites of Mcl-1 are required for the
association of Mcl-1 and Pin1, we then investigated whether the
two sites are required for Mcl-1 stabilization. We showed that Mcl1-92/163DD, a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant, was more
stabilized than WT Mcl-1 and Mcl-1-92/163AA, a nonphosphorylation mutant (Supplementary Fig. S2). Mcl-1-92/163AA, a nonphosphorylation mutant, was rapidly degraded; however, Mcl-1-92/
163DD, a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant, exhibited longer
stability by nearly 2-fold compared with WT Mcl-1 (8 versus 4 h;
Fig. 4D).
Down-regulation of Pin1 induces apoptosis and chemosensitization. Because phosphorylation of Mcl-1 by Erk is required
for the association and stabilization of Mcl-1 by Pin1, we
investigated whether Pin1 is required for Erk-induced Mcl-1 upregulation. SiRNA against Pin1 was performed to down-regulate
Pin1. As expected, down-regulation of Pin1 blocked TPA-induced
Mcl-1 up-regulation (Fig. 5A). Because down-regulation of Pin1
decreased Mcl-1 expression, and Mcl-1 is known to induce
antiapoptosis and chemoresistance, we next examined whether
down-regulation of Pin1 may render apoptosis and chemosensitization. In MCF7 cells, SiRNA against Pin1 led to a moderate
amount apoptosis compared with SiRNA control (11% versus 4%),
which was blocked by cotransfection with Mcl-1 (Fig. 5B).
Furthermore, SiRNA against Pin1 significantly sensitized Taxol,
and 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) caused-cell death by almost 2-fold
compared with control Si-RNA, which was also overridden by
overexpression of Mcl-1 (Fig. 5C), indicating that down-regulation
of Pin1 facilitates chemosensitization through down-regulation of
Mcl-1.
Sorafenib sensitizes chemotherapy through down-regulation
Mcl-1. Phosphorylation by Erk is required for Pin1-mediated
Mcl-1 stabilization; therefore, we next investigated whether
inhibition of the Erk pathway could overcome Mcl-1–mediated
chemoresistance. We found that Sorafenib, a RAF/MAPK pathway
inhibitor that is recently approved by the FDA, suppressed Mcl-1
expression in a dose-dependent manner in two breast cancer cell
lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB435 (Fig. 6A). We then combined
Sorafenib and Taxol or 5-Fu to treat MCF7 cells and found that
it dramatically sensitized the tumor cell to the chemodrug Taxol or
5-Fu in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B). The sensitized killing
effects were much more significant when Mcl-1 expression was
inhibited by Sorafenib at 5 and 10 Amol/L (*, P < 0.05). We further
investigated whether overexpression of Mcl-1 could override
Sorafenib-caused chemosensitization. The results showed that
transfection of Mcl-1 blocked Taxol and Sorafenib-caused cell
death, and cotranfection of GSK-3h, which is known to degrade
Mcl-1 cells, were sensitized to Taxol and Sorafenib-caused cell
death again. However, transfection of Mcl-1 92/163DD, a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant, or transfection of Mcl-1 plus Pin1,
was still resistant to Taxol plus Sorafenib–caused cell death, even

under the treatment of GSK-3h (Fig. 6C). Taken together, our
results indicate that Sorafenib circumvents Mcl-1–caused chemoresistance, which suggests that the combination chemotherapy of
Taxol and Sorafenib may be a promising treatment for overcoming
breast cancer chemoresistance in clinic.

Discussion
Dual regulation of Mcl-1 by Erk/Pin1 and GSK-3B/B-Trcp
pathways. As a member of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family, Mcl-1
promotes cell viability similar to Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, but in
comparison, Mcl-1 is rapid-response gene with short half-life.
Because no mutation was found in the full-length of Mcl-1,
upstream regulating signals seem to play an important role in
Mcl-1 stabilization and degradation. However, the upstream
regulators are not fully identified. Recently, CDK was found to
phosphorylate Mcl-1 at Thr 64 residue and then stabilize it (38).
We also identified that GSK-3h is a upstream regulator, which
phosphorylates Mcl-1 at Ser 155, Ser 159, and Thr163 residues and
then recruits E3 ligase h-Trcp to degrade Mcl-1 (20, 21). Erk is
known to up-regulate Mcl-1, but its mechanism is not clearly

understood. In the current study, Mcl-1 was phosphorylated by Erk
at two consensus motifs, 92 TP and 163 TP, which can be recognized
by the isomerase Pin1, possibly causing its conformation change to
stabilize Mcl-1. We observed that Thr163 was both recognized and
phosphorylated by GSK-3h and Erk, which, interestingly, resulted
in the opposite fate for Mcl-1, i.e., phosphorylation of Thr 163 by
GSK-3h causes degradation of Mcl-1, but phosphorylation by Erk
stabilizes it. The phenomenon indicated that phosphorylation of
Thr163 is a triggering or priming event that allows subsequent
phosphorylations by GSK-3h (Ser 155, Ser 159) or by Erk (Thr92)
to decide the fate of Mcl-1. We hypothesize that conformational
change of Mcl-1 by Pin1 may interfere with its association with
GSK-3h and h-Trcp, which may block its degradation by them. The
protein structure modulation change of Mcl-1 by Pin1 after
phosphorylation by Erk and the crosstalk between Erk/Pin1 and
GSK-3h/h-Trcp on the regulation of Mcl-1 will be further studied.
Generally, our current results, together with previous findings,
provide a plausible mechanism (Supplementary Fig. S3) for how the
fate of Mcl-1 is dictated by Erk/Pin1 and GSK-3h/h-Trcp pathways.
Sorafenib can overcome Mcl-1–caused chemoresistance.

of tubulin and then plotted (right ). B, MCF7 cells were treated with Sorafenib and chemo-drug 5-Fu (10 Ag/mL) or Taxol (2 nmol/L) for 48 h. Relative cell viability was
measured by the MTT assay; cell viability without chemo-drug treatment was defined as 100% control. C, MCF7 cells were transfected with Mcl-1-WT, Mcl-1-92/163AA,
or Mcl-1-92/163DD with or without Pin1 and GSK-3h as indicated for 24 h and then treated with Taxol (2 nmol/L) and Sorafenib (10 Amol/L) for 48 h. Relative cell viability
was measured by the MTT assay; cell viability without chemo-drug treatment was defined as 100% control.

of human myeloid leukemia; subsequently, its overexpression is
often found in multiple types of solid tumor, such as hepatoma,
ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and others. Other than its role as
an oncogenic factor to promote tumorigenesis (16–18), its high
expression was also thought of as a contributing factor to
chemoresistance (13, 19). For example, Mcl-1 is highly expressed
in over 60% of human breast cancer patient sample and plays a role
in chemoresistance in breast cancer (20, 21). In the current study,
negative expression of Pin1 and Mcl-1 were both significantly
correlated with patients’ survival in 101 human breast cancer
samples. In contrast, positive expression of both Pin1 and Mcl-1
were correlated with poor survival, indicating that the expression
of Mcl-1 and Pin1 might be a predictive marker for poor prognosis
in breast cancer patients.
Tyrosine kinase receptor Her2 is overexpressed in f30%
human breast cancer, and its expression level correlates with
chemoresistance and poor patient prognosis. Although its role has
been extensively addressed in breast cancer, the molecular
mechanisms underlying Her2-mediated Taxol (Paclitaxel) resistance are not clearly identified (39–41). Previous studies have
shown that Her2 up-regulates the cyclin-dependent kinase
inhibitor p21 and inhibits p34 (CDC2), which are required for
Taxol-induced apoptosis (42, 43). Moreover, Her2 activates the
Erk/MAPK pathway and AKT kinase, which is known to inactivate
GSK-3h through phosphorylation at Ser9 residue, resulting in the
up-regulation of Mcl-1, which will render resistance to chemotherapy (37). Several strategies have been developed and used in
the clinic or clinical trials to reverse Her2-mediated chemoresistance, such as the anti-Her2 receptor antibody Herceptin
and the adenovirus type 5 E1A gene (40, 44), which downregulates Her2. Clinical trials have shown that the Taxol response
rate in patients with Her2-overexpreeeing breast cancers is
significantly higher in patients receiving both Taxol and Herceptin.
However, Her2 is only expressed in a small portion of breast

cancers, and there are many other growth factors that could
activate Erk and AKT kinase to up-regulate Mcl-1. A recent report
showed that the expression of Her2 in breast cancer patients is
associated with a benefit from Taxol plus doxorubicin and
cyclophosphamide treatment, but patients with Her2-negative
breast cancer only gain little benefit from the same therapy
(45). In the current study, we identified a novel underlying
mechanism for Erk-induced Mcl-1 up-regulation, namely, the
phosphorylation of Mcl-1 by Erk to be primed and stabilized by
Pin1. Based on the above findings, we developed two strategies to
overcome Mcl-1–mediated chemoresistance, i.e., either inhibiting
Erk/MAPK pathway (Sorafenib, an approved clinical anticancer
drug) or knocking down Pin1 by SiRNA. The results showed that
they both down-regulate Mcl-1. Furthermore, under treatment
with the two methods, the breast cancer cell line MCF7 was
sensitized to Taxol. In conclusion, this newly identified mechanism provides a scientific basis for a plausible combination of
chemodrugs in breast cancer, Taxol plus Sorafenib, to overcome
chemoresistance.
