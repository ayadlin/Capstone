Placebo and Nocebo Effects in Randomized
Double-Blind Clinical Trials of Agents for the
Therapy for Fatigue in Patients With
Advanced Cancer
Maxine de la Cruz, MD, David Hui, MD, Henrique A. Parsons, MD; and Eduardo Bruera, MD

BACKGROUND: A significant response to placebo in randomized controlled trials of treatments for cancer-related fatigue (CRF) had been reported. A retrospective study was conducted to determine the frequency and predictors of
response to placebo effect and nocebo effects in patients with CRF treated in those trials. METHODS: The records of
105 patients who received placebo in 2 previous randomized clinical trials conducted by this group were reviewed.
The proportion of patients who demonstrated clinical response to fatigue, defined as an increase in Functional
Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue score of 7 from baseline to Day 8, and the proportion of patients
with a nocebo effect, defined as those reporting >2 side effects, were determined. Baseline patient characteristics
and symptoms recorded using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) were analyzed to determine their
association with placebo and nocebo effects. RESULTS: Fifty-nine (56%) patients had a placebo response. Worse
baseline anxiety and well-being subscale score (univariate) and well-being (multivariate) were significantly associated
with placebo response. Commonly reported side effects were insomnia (79%), anorexia (53%), nausea (38%), and
restlessness (34%). Multivariate analysis indicated that worse baseline (ESAS) sleep, appetite, and nausea were associated with increased reporting of the corresponding side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Greater than half of advanced cancer patients enrolled in CRF trials had a placebo response. Worse baseline physical well-being score was associated
with placebo response. Patients experiencing specific symptoms at baseline were more likely to report these as side
effects of the medication. These findings should be considered in the design of future CRF trials. Cancer

Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is defined as a persistent, subjective sense of tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or
its treatment and is not proportional to recent activity, interferes with usual functioning, and does not usually resolve with
rest.1 CRF is the most common symptom reported in patients with advanced cancer2,3 and is estimated to be present in
approximately 60% to 90% of patients receiving active treatment, and in 30% to 75% of cancer survivors.4-6 Multiple
therapeutic approaches have been proposed to treat this condition. However, to our knowledge, to date, there is no single
drug intervention considered standard therapy for CRF.
In 2 randomized controlled trials, our group investigated the psychostimulant methylphenidate and the anticholinesterase inhibitor donepezil in the treatment of CRF. These trials failed to demonstrate a significant difference between
the drugs and placebo. In both trials, we noted considerable response to placebo.7,8 This so-called placebo effect has previously been extensively described in the literature for pain, Parkinson disease, the immune system, asthma, and depression.9-12
Placebo is described as a biologically inert substance, or any other form of therapy or intervention, that when given
as an intervention is not expected to produce favorable outcomes. A placebo effect is any favorable psychobiologic effect after the administration of a placebo.13 To distinguish the therapeutic effect of an inert substance from the harmful effects

that it may cause, the term nocebo, which in Latin means
I will harm, is used. A nocebo effect is defined as any distressing effect of a placebo, and is less studied in the
literature.14
As with randomized controlled trials of treatments
for other symptoms, such as pain, randomized controlled
trials of therapy for fatigue may be influenced by significant confounding effect of the placebo and nocebo effects,
which may prevent accurate estimation of the power
needed to determine efficacy. To our knowledge, no studies have been published to date that indicate the placebo
and nocebo effects on fatigue. The purpose of the current
study was to determine the frequency and predictors of
placebo and nocebo effects in patients with CRF, which
could allow for better design of future fatigue treatment
trials and also aid future researchers in their interpretation
of results, particularly with regard to reported side effects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We conducted new analyses of data already collected from
254 patients with CRF who participated in 2 clinical trials
previously conducted by our team between July 1, 2003,
and July 6, 2006. The current study was approved by the
institutional review board of The University of Texas M.
D. Anderson Cancer Center. Two trials have already been
reported.7,8 In 1 trial, patients were randomly assigned to
receive either methylphenidate or placebo, and in the
other trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive either donepezil or placebo. The patients took their medications for 7 days. All patients had advanced cancer and
reported a fatigue score of at least 4 on the Edmonton
Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS)15 during the last 24
hours on at least 4 consecutive days. Medications, including chemotherapy that the patients were already taking
before the trial were not restricted or discontinued.
Patients taking antidepressants were maintained on stable
doses during the study period. The patients were included
in the current retrospective study if they received placebo
as an intervention for fatigue. There were 22 patients
randomized to placebo who were not evaluable due to
dropping out or missing data. A total of 105 patients who
received placebo in the 2 previous trials were pooled for
analysis. Data collection is described in the flowchart in
Figure 1.
The following demographic information was collected: age, gender, race, marital status, educational level,
and primary cancer diagnosis. Functional Assessment of

scores, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores,
and reported side effects were also collected.15-17 FACITF is an assessment tool that has been validated for use in
CRF. It is comprised of 4 domains of well-being (physical,
social, emotional, and functional) and an additional 13point fatigue subscore. The patient rates the intensity of
fatigue and other symptoms on a scale of 0 to 4. The
scores range from 0 to 54, and higher scores correspond to
less fatigue.16 The ESAS is a validated tool that is used to
assess the intensity of 9 common symptoms in patients
with cancer or chronic illness (pain, fatigue, nausea,
depression, anxiety, anorexia, drowsiness, shortness of
breath, and sleep) as well as feeling of well-being. The
patient rates each symptom on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0
being no symptom and 10 being the worst possible symptom.15,18 The MMSE is a 30-point assessment tool that is
used to determine cognitive status, with the higher number denoting more intact cognition.17
In both studies, the patients were asked if they developed side effects from the drug. The side effects listed
were slurred speech, restlessness, behavioral change, dizziness, vertigo, tachycardia, insomnia, and anorexia.
Our study had 2 parts, the placebo part and the
nocebo part. In this study, the term placebo will be used
to designate the positive and therapeutic effects of the
inert substance, and nocebo will be used to denote the
effects of the inert substance that were considered harmful
to the patient. For the placebo part, patients who were
included in the study were classified as either responders
or nonresponders to placebo. A patient was considered to
be a responder if there was an improvement (increase) in
FACIT-F score of at least 7 points between baseline and
end of study (Day 8). This definition of responder was

taken from our previous studies.7,8 For the nocebo part of
our study, patients who reported 2 side effects from the
inert drug were considered to have a nocebo effect. This
cutoff point was based on the fact that the median number
of side effects reported by patients was 2.
To determine the association between baseline characteristics, FACIT-F scores, ESAS scores, MMSE scores,
and response to placebo, the responders and nonresponders were compared using the chi-square test for categoric
variables and a Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous
variables. Subsequent multivariate regression analysis was
done using variables that were noted to be significant to
determine the best model for predictors. Significance levels less than .05 were considered statistically significant.
The same statistical analyses were performed to determine
the association between various factors and nocebo effect.

RESULTS
Patient demographic characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. Among the 105 patients included in this analysis,
63 (60%) were women, 79 (75%) were Caucasians, 69
(66%) were married, and 52 (51%) had a college degree
or higher. The most common primary malignancy was
breast cancer, which was the primary malignancy in 35
(33%) patients.
Fifty-nine (56%) patients of reported a response to
the placebo. Patient characteristics of responders and nonresponders to placebo are summarized in Table 2. On univariate analysis, factors found to be significantly
associated with response to placebo were worse baseline
ESAS anxiety and worse baseline FACIT-F physical wellbeing subscale score, fatigue subscale score, and total
FACIT-F score (Table 2). Other variables tested did not
demonstrate any significant association with response to
placebo. On multivariate regression analysis, only worse
baseline FACIT-F physical well-being subscale score was
found to be a significant predictor of placebo response
(odds ratio [OR], 0.86; P ¼ .001).
Pooled patients reported 10 different side effects.
These side effects and the proportions of patients who
reported each side effect are listed in Table 3. Eight side
effects reported by patients in both studies. In the methylphenidate study, nausea was reported in addition to the
other 8 side effects. In the donepezil study, skin changes
were reported in addition to the other 8 side effects. The
most common side effects reported were insomnia (79%),
followed by anorexia (53%), nausea (33%), and restlessness (34%).

There was no association noted between the reporting of side effects and response or lack of response to placebo. Multivariate analysis for each of the symptoms
indicated that worse baseline ESAS sleep, appetite, and
nausea scores were associated with increased reporting of
these side effects. With each unit increase in the FACIT-F
functional well-being score, patients were 15% less likely
to report insomnia. Each unit increase in the FACIT-F fatigue subscale score was associated with patients reporting
less anorexia. Patients with baseline nausea were twice as
likely to report nausea as a side effect and those with baseline anxiety were more likely to report restlessness. Other
variables that demonstrated significant association in our
multivariate logistic regression model are shown in
Table 4.
A total of 96 (91%) patients reported at least 1 side
effect to the placebo drug. Using the cutoff of 2 as a basis
of grouping those with nocebo effect and those without it,
we found that 30 (29%) patients were considered to have
no nocebo effect and 75 (71%) patients reported nocebo
effects. Worse baseline pain (P ¼ .05), drowsiness (P ¼
.05), and sleep (P ¼ .03) were associated with nocebo

All listed side effects were reported by patients in both studies expect for
nausea, which was reported only by patients in the methylphenidate study,
and skin problems, which were reported only by patients in the donepezil
study.

Brown reported that placebo effect occurred in approximately 30% to 40% of patients.13,19 It has been suggested
that the nature of the disorder or symptom influences
whether a placebo effect occurs and that subjective symptoms such as pain, anxiety, and depression are more amenable to placebo effects than are more objective measures
such as blood pressure.20 It is not surprising, therefore,
that a subjective symptom such as fatigue can be influenced by the placebo effect.
To the best of our knowledge, the mechanisms
underlying the placebo effect is not fully understood. One
proposed mechanism involves the brain’s reward circuitry.
On the basis of findings from studies on pain and Parkinson disease, it has been hypothesized that expectations of
reward or clinical improvement and great desire for effect
play a critical role in the placebo effect.10,21,22 This may
in part explain why there was a significant association in
our current study between worse baseline Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) physical well-being score and placebo response. Patients with
worse baseline fatigue may have had greater desire for
effect and might also have increased expectations of
improvement given their higher symptom burden.
Unfortunately, we did not measure patients’ expectation
and this should be done in future research. Another possible explanation for the observed placebo effect in this
group of patients may be related to the concept of regression to the mean, in which the measured change could be
secondary to nonsystematic variations.
Although some patients were being treated with
medications that can affect fatigue such as chemotherapy
or antidepressants, they were receiving stable doses during
the duration of the study. Therefore, we believe that their

770

potential to confound our findings are not significant,
particularly in these short-term 7-day studies.
The concept of a direct relation between expectation
of a desired effect and the actual occurrence of such an
effect has been supported by other studies. Linde et al
reported that, in 864 patients who received acupuncture
for therapy for pain, improvement was significantly associated with high expectations of treatment effect.23 In a
study of 26 premenopausal women with irritable bowel
disease, investigators concluded that placebo analgesia was
associated with increased expectations of pain relief and
decrease in negative emotions such as anxiety.9 Other
authors have reported this same relation for other
conditions.11,24,25
Kaptchuk et al reported that there were specific personalities that respond to placebo interventions.26 In earlier studies by the pain placebo pioneer team of Lasagna
and Beecher, the investigators reported that only 13 of 93
patients who received placebo twice and reported therapeutic response were reliable placebo responders and that
these 13 patients were more anxious, more self-centered,
and had more baseline somatic complaints than patients
who were nonresponders or inconsistent placebo responders.27 The findings of the current study that patients with
higher baseline ESAS anxiety were more likely to respond
to placebo are consistent with those reports.
Other characteristics that were previously shown to
contribute to placebo response such as gender and age
were not observed in this study.28-30 As pointed out by
previous investigators, the variables reported in different
disease conditions are very difficult to replicate, not generalizable, and inconsistent.31,32 It could be that these factors would only be contributory to other conditions and
not for fatigue. Hyland et al and Whalley et al reported
that most variables are related to symptoms and disease
characteristics and not patient characteristics.33,34
The nocebo effect is even less understood than the
placebo effect but is believed to be related, similar to the
placebo effect, to some neurobiologic mechanism involving negative expectations regarding treatment outcome,
expectations of harm, worsening or vulnerability,14 prior
conditioning as by previous untoward experiences such as
adverse reactions to drugs or interventions,35 and certain
psychologic characteristics.
Nearly 25% of patients taking a placebo experience
side effects.36 Rosenzweig et al reported that 19% of
healthy volunteers taking placebo reported side effects.37
Pogge reported in a review of 67 placebo-controlled trials
that at least 23% of patients who received a placebo

reported at least 1 side effect.38 In the current study, 91%
of the patients reported at least 1 side effect from a placebo
drug, and 71% of patients were considered to have nocebo
effect. It is likely that the higher frequency reported in the
current study compared with other studies can be
explained by negative expectations and symptoms that
were already reported to be present even before treatment.
Providing a list of all the potential side effects of the active
drug may have created a negative expectation of treatment
outcome and harm. It has been shown for example, that
negative expectations result in the amplification of the
pain being reported.10 The list of side effects may have
conditioned the patient to expect these to develop over
the course of the trial.
To our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature of specific patient characteristics associated with the
nocebo effect. Some investigators reported that people
who tend to be anxious or depressed are more at risk of
developing nocebo effect in response to attempts at treatment.35 The results of the current study indicated that
patients with anxiety were more likely to report restlessness and that those with depression were more likely to
report more tachycardia. These findings suggest, as has
been reported in previous studies, that the nocebo effect is
related to somatization, whereby the patient expresses
emotional distress as physical symptoms.
We found interesting results for those patients who
reported nocebo effect. Patients who had insomnia at
baseline were more likely to report more nocebo effects.
We speculate that if patients did not feel particularly well
at baseline, they were much more likely to express their
symptoms as a side effect.

Many commonly reported nocebo effects in patients
receiving placebo are more generalized such as nausea, fatigue, drowsiness, and insomnia.31 These were observed
in the current study patients as well, with insomnia being
the most frequently reported, followed by anorexia, nausea, and restlessness. What was of interest was that patients
had reported some of these as symptoms (insomnia, anorexia, and nausea) in their baseline ESAS assessment. It
would appear that patients were misattributing these
symptoms as nocebo effects rather than as resulting from
the underlying disease. This has been described previously
for pain by Turner et al.31 More research is needed to test
this hypothesis.
Our hypothesis that patient’s expectations of outcome, whether positive or negative, are associated with either the placebo and nocebo effect needs to be interpreted
cautiously due to the retrospective nature of the study.
Future research is needed to test this hypothesis. In addition, the current study consisted of a very small cohort of
patients, and future studies with a larger patient population are needed to confirm our findings.
Previous authors have described placebo side effects,
which are side effects attributed to taking the placebo drug
and are not considered to be nocebo effects.14 In the case of
the nocebo effect, there is a negative expectation associated
with the reporting of side effects. In the context of clinical
trials, as was in the 2 trials that we have analyzed, when
potential side effects to the active drug are enumerated to
the patient, negative expectations can occur.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically
examine placebo and nocebo effects in patients with CRF.
We found that a good proportion of patients experienced
placebo effect and an even greater proportion reported
nocebo effects. The implications of these findings are important in the context of research and treatment. Clinical trials
on CRF should take into consideration placebo and nocebo
effects when designing clinical trials. When patients
randomized to placebo demonstrate substantial clinical
response, it would be difficult for patients that received the
treatment drug to demonstrate an even greater response.39,40
Failure to consider the placebo effect may explain why previous trials have failed to demonstrate significant therapeutic
effects of drugs over placebo. Strategies in research design
aimed at perhaps minimizing the placebo effect, such as a
bigger sample size or longer trial period, are needed to more
effectively evaluate the real effect of treatment. Our observation of a nocebo effect further justifies use of a placebo in
clinical trials because it permits better appraisal of side effects
of active drug. Researchers need to recognize that the nocebo

phenomenon exists. Our findings on the nocebo effect also
raise the question regarding the disclosure of potential side
effects in the daily clinical setting. If negative expectations
can influence the reporting of adverse events, how then
should we inform our patients regarding the possibility of
side effects without causing harm or suffering?
With increasing interest in and better understanding
of the placebo and nocebo phenomena, supportive therapy along with pharmacologic intervention aimed at maximizing treatment benefit may be more incorporated in
routine patient care.
Conclusions
Greater than half of patients with advanced cancer enrolled in the fatigue trials responded to placebo. A worse
baseline physical well-being score was associated with placebo response. Patients experiencing specific symptoms at
baseline were more likely to report these as side effects of
the medication. These findings should be considered in
the design of future clinical trials of the treatment of CRF.
