Abstract
The promising antitumor activity of 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) results from inhibition of the
molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and
subsequent degradation of multiple oncogenic client proteins.
Gene expression microarray and proteomic analysis were used
to profile molecular changes in the A2780 human ovarian
cancer cell line treated with 17AAG. Comparison of results
with an inactive analogue and an alternative HSP90 inhibitor
radicicol indicated that increased expression of HSP72,
HSC70, HSP27, HSP47, and HSP90B at the mRNA level were
on-target effects of 17AAG. HSP27 protein levels were
increased in tumor biopsies following treatment of patients
with 17AAG. A group of MYC-regulated mRNAs was decreased
by 17AAG. Of particular interest and novelty were changes
in expression of chromatin-associated proteins. Expression of
the heterochromatin protein 1 was increased, and expression
of the histone acetyltransferase 1 and the histone arginine
methyltransferase PRMT5 was decreased by 17AAG. PRMT5
was shown to be a novel HSP90-binding partner and potential
client protein. Cellular protein acetylation was reduced by
17AAG, which was shown to have an antagonistic interaction
on cell proliferation with the histone deacetylase inhibitor
trichostatin A. This mRNA and protein expression analysis has
provided new insights into the complex molecular pharmacology of 17AAG and suggested new genes and proteins that
may be involved in response to the drug or be potential
biomarkers of drug action. [Cancer Res 2007;67(7):3239–53]

anticancer agents and provide a means of obtaining a detailed
molecular signature of drug action (1, 2). In addition, these
methods may identify pharmacodynamic markers that can be used
to evaluate drugs in clinical trials. Gene expression microarrays are
increasingly used to investigate the molecular responses to cancer
drugs in tumor cells (1). Although valuable, analysis of gene
expression at the mRNA level alone cannot adequately predict
protein expression or functional states. Therefore, proteomic
approaches also have considerable potential in the drug development process (2).
Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a major class of molecular
chaperones that play a vital role in the cellular stress response
and cancer (3, 4). One particular chaperone, HSP90, is of
considerable current interest as a new cancer therapeutic target
because of its essential role in maintaining the conformational
stability and function of a number of oncogenic ‘‘client’’ proteins
that are required for cellular proliferation, cell cycle regulation,
apoptosis, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis ( for review, see
refs. 4, 5). The natural product HSP90 inhibitors radicicol,
geldanamycin, and their derivatives exert their antitumor effect
by inhibiting the intrinsic ATPase activity of HSP90, resulting in
degradation of HSP90 client proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (4, 5). Based on its novel mechanism of action
and the potential for combinatorial effects on multiple
oncogenic pathways and on all of the hallmarks of cancer (6),
together with promising therapeutic effects in animal models
(e.g., refs. 7–9), the geldanamycin analogue 17-allylamino-17demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG), a benzoquinone ansamycin,
has completed phase I and is now in phase II clinical trials as
the first-in-class HSP90 inhibitor (10, 11). Other HSP90 inhibitors
are also in development (5).
Gene expression profiling studies have been done previously in
a panel of human colon cancer cell lines following treatment with
17AAG (12). That study identified HSC70 (HSPA8) and HSP90b
(HSPCB) as 17AAG-responsive genes (12). Alongside depletion in
levels of client proteins, such as c-RAF-1 and cyclin-dependent
kinase 4 (CDK4), inducible HSP72 (HSPA1A/HSPA1B) has been
used as a pharmacodynamic end point in phase I clinical trials of
17AAG (e.g., ref. 10). Indeed, this basic molecular signature has
been used to show HSP90 inhibition in the tumor tissue of
treated patients, and this was associated with prolonged stable
disease in two patients with metastatic malignant melanoma (10).
The cellular response to HSP90 inhibition has a complex nature
that involves both multiple protein changes and effects on

transcription. We hypothesized that by using proteomic analysis
in combination with gene expression microarray profiling we
might identify additional molecular responses to 17AAG that
would increase our understanding of the mechanism of action of
the drug. This approach also has the potential to facilitate the
discovery of new HSP90 client proteins as well as to suggest novel
pharmacodynamic markers.
We now report a study in which the complementary
approaches of mRNA and protein expression profiling have been
used in parallel to examine expression changes in response to
drug treatment in a human cancer cell line. Changes in mRNA
and protein expression were determined following treatment of
a human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line with 17AAG. In
addition, we sought to distinguish ‘‘on-target’’ effects (those which
are a consequence of HSP90 inhibition) from ‘‘off-target’’ effects
(those which relate to other interactions) by comparison of the
molecular responses obtained following treatment with 17AAG
with those seen with the chemically dissimilar HSP90 inhibitor
radicicol or an inactive analogue of 17AAG. Selected known and
novel expression changes were followed up by validation using
Western blotting and investigation of functional and therapeutic
significance.
Expression profiling studies revealed that around 3% of the
total gene transcripts examined and 4% of the detectable proteins
were responsive to 17AAG treatment. The changes seen involved
a number of molecular chaperones, protein synthesis and degradation components, signaling molecules, and proteins involved in
acetylation and methylation processes. Effects on HSP72, HSC70,
HSP27 (HSPB1), HSP47, and HSP90h expression were identified
as on-target effects of HSP90 inhibition. Together with HSP72,
HSP27 was shown to exhibit increased expression in tumor
biopsies from patients treated with 17AAG. Cellular protein
acetylation was reduced following HSP90 inhibition, a possible
consequence of altered expression changes of 17AAG-responsive
acetylation proteins, including the histone acetyltransferase-1
(HAT-1). In addition, the protein arginine methyltransferase
PRMT5 was identified as a new HSP90 binding partner and
potential client protein, providing evidence that alterations in
both protein acetylation and methylation may contribute to the
mechanism of action of HSP90 inhibitors. This study shows that
the combined deployment of the complementary techniques of
proteomics and gene expression profiling is a useful strategy for
examining molecular responses to novel cancer therapeutics,
particularly those with complex effects, providing valuable
information on the mechanism of drug action and enabling the
identification of biomarkers of drug activity.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and clinical biopsy specimens. Human cancer cell lines
(A2780 ovarian, HCT116 colon, and WM266.4 melanoma) were obtained
from the American Tissue Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells
were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 mmol/L
glutamine, and 1 nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Paisley,
United Kingdom) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37jC.
Biopsies were obtained pretreatment and posttreatment (24 h) with 17-AAG
(450 mg/m2) as part of the phase I clinical trial (10). Appropriate ethical
committee approval and informed consent were obtained. Separate consent
forms were signed before pretreatment and posttreatment biopsies.
Compounds. 17AAG (NSC330507) and the closely related, but
essentially inactive, 4-aminobutyrate ester of 17AAG (NSC683201) were
kindly supplied by Dr E. Sausville et al. (National Cancer Institute,
Rockville and Bethesda, MD). Radicicol and trichostatin A (TSA) were

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (Poole, United Kingdom). Compounds
were stored as 2 mmol/L stocks in DMSO at 20jC and protected from
light. All reagents were from Sigma unless stated otherwise and were of
highest chemical grade.
Combination treatments. A2780 cells were seeded at 1,000 per well in
96-well plates. Sulfurhodamine blue staining was used to determine the IC50
at 96 h for TSA and 17AAG. These values were then used in combination
studies according to the median effect analysis method of Chou and Talalay
(13). Briefly, increasing concentrations of TSA and 17AAG were added at a
ratio of 1:1 based on their respective IC50 values. Following a 96-h exposure,
cells were stained with sulfurhodamine blue, and a combination index for
nonexclusive interactions was calculated using an algorithm based on that
described by Chou and Talalay (13). A combination index of 1 indicates an
additive interaction; a combination index < 1 indicates a synergistic
interaction; and a combination index > 1 indicates an antagonistic
interaction.
Protein extraction. A2780 cells were plated in 75-cm2 dishes at a
density of 1  106 and left to attach for 24 h. Control cells were set up in
quadruplicate, and 17AAG-treated cells set up in duplicate. Additional
dishes were set up for cDNA microarray and Western blotting analysis.
Cells were treated for 24 h with pharmacologically relevant, isoeffective
concentrations of 17AAG (60 nmol/L) and radicicol (600 nmol/L), or, in
some experiments, with an equimolar concentration of the inactive
17AAG analogue and radicicol in relation to 17AAG (60 nmol/L) in 10 mL
medium.
Cell lysates for proteomic analysis were prepared in a laminar flow
hood by scraping the cells into lysis buffer containing 8 mol/L urea
(Merck, Poole, United Kingdom), 2 mol/L thiourea (Merck), 4% CHAPS, 65
mmol/L DTT (Merck), and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, East
Lewes, United Kingdom). Lysates were syringed using a 25-gauge needle
and centrifuged at 14,000  g for 5 min at 15jC. Protein concentrations,
which were all in the range of 0.5 to 1 mg/mL, were determined using a
Bradford assay.
For immunoblotting, cell pellets from A2780 cells in culture, or tissue
from tumor biopsies from patients, were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mmol/L
NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 1% NP40, 0.2% SDS, 2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Ag/L aprotinin, 10 Ag/L leupeptin, 1 mmol/L
sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mmol/L NaF, and 0.5 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate) for 20 min on ice and centrifuged at 14,000  g, and the supernatant
recovered. Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic
acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL).
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein identification.
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was done as described (14). Immobilized pH gradient strips, 18-cm pH3-10NL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
Little Chalfont, United Kingdom), were used for the first dimension
separation of 150 Ag protein lysate followed by second dimension
separation on 20-cm gradient PAGE gels (Oxford Glycosciences, Oxford,
United Kingdom). Following fixation and post-staining with silver stain, gels
were scanned, and the resulting images were analyzed using Melanie II
software and in-house analysis tools (15). All gels were run in duplicate. The
mean value of % volume for features matched between duplicate gels was
used for quantitative analysis. To quantitate temporal changes in matched
features where the feature of interest could not be detected in one of the
gels, the spot outline was copied to the relevant gel image from a matching
gel, and the missing spot was assigned a value equivalent to the background
volume within the spot outline. Spots showing systematic variation in
intensity as a result of 17AAG treatment were excised from the gel using a
robotic cutter.
Protein identification was done by matrix-assisted laser desorption/
ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) as follows. The excised gel spots
were subjected to reduction and alkylation using DTT (Pierce) and
iodoacetic acid (Sigma, Poole, United Kingdom) followed by in-gel digestion
with modified trypsin (Promega, Southampton, United Kingdom) similar to
methods previously described (16, 17).
MALDI MS was done on a Reflex III (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen,
Germany) mass spectrometer in the reflector mode using delayed
extraction. A 0.5-AL aliquot of the in-gel digest was mixed with 1 AL of

a saturated aqueous 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid solution directly on the
target plate and subsequently dried under a warm stream of air. The
peptide mass fingerprint recorded was internally calibrated using the
tryptic autolysis product ions at the monoisotopic masses of m/z 842.5100
and 2,211.1046. The MS-Fit program (ProteinProspector, University of
California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA) was used for peptide mass
mapping and searching the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein database, similar to earlier descriptions (18). The
peptide mass tolerance was set to F100 ppm.
cDNA microarrays. Cells were lysed in denaturing buffer [2.7 mol/L
guanidium thiocyanate, 1.3 mol/L ammonium thiocyanate, 100 mmol/L
sodium acetate (NaOAc; pH 4)] and extracted twice with saturated
phenol [0.61 g/mL phenol, 16% v/v glycerol, 100 mmol/L NaOAc (pH 4)]
and chloroform. Polyadenylated mRNA [poly(A+) mRNA] was prepared
from total RNA using oligo (dT) cellulose (Micro-FastTrack 2.0,
Invitrogen, Paisley, United Kingdom). Poly(A)+ mRNA was concentrated
using Centricon spin columns (Millipore Ltd, Watford, United Kingdom)
to a final volume of 5 AL.
cDNA microarrays were done according to the procedure outlined in
(12). All array experiments were replicated independently: 17AAG (n = 4)
and radicicol and NSC683201 (n = 2). Lowstra analysis fits a Lowess curve to
remove any systematic bias from the experiment. Outliers from the
straightened data set are detected using a Student’s t test, such that points
furthest from the straight line are statistically significant (98% confidence
level) from the points lying along the straight line (19). Cluster and Treeview
algorithms6 were used to obtain self-organizing maps of the gene expression
data sets (20).
SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Samples (typically 75 Ag protein)
were denatured in Laemmli loading buffer [10% glycerol, 5% h-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mmol/L Tris (pH 6.8), 0.05% bromophenol blue] and
were separated on 4% to 20% Tris-Glycine polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen)
using the Novex X-Cell Surelock Mini electrophoresis system (Invitrogen).
Proteins were electrotransferred to a 0.22-Am nitrocellulose membrane
(Invitrogen), and membranes were blocked for at least 1 h in casein
blocking buffer [150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris base, 0.25 mmol/L
thimerosal, 0.5% Hammarsten grade casein (pH 7.6)]. Membranes were
exposed to primary antibody in casein blocking buffer overnight. The
following antibodies were used: anti-rabbit polyclonal c-RAF-1 antibody
(C-12; Santa Cruz, CA); 1.0 Ag/mL mouse monoclonal HSP72 (SPA-840;
Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada), 0.9 Ag/mL mouse monoclonal HSP27 antibody (SPA-800; Stressgen), 1.0 Ag/mL anti-mouse
monoclonal HSP72/HSC70 antibody (SPA-820; Stressgen), 1.3 Ag/mL rat
monoclonal HSP90a antibody (Stressgen); 1:1,000 dilution rabbit polyclonal PRMT5 methyltransferase antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston,
MA); 1:1,000 rabbit polyclonal c-AKT antibody (Cell Signaling Technology);
1:1,000 rabbit polyclonal ERBB2 (C-18; Santa Cruz); 1:1,000 rabbit polyclonal CDK4 (C-22; Santa Cruz). Membranes were washed twice with PBS
containing 0.05% Tween 20. Visualization of the bound primary antibody
was done by probing with anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)
or anti-rabbit IgG HRP at 1:1,000 dilution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech),
and the membranes washed four times. Immunodetection was carried
out using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce) and exposure to
photographic film (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Acetylation ELISA. A2780 cells (8  102) were seeded into 96-well plates
and left to attach for 36 h. The cells were then treated with a concentration
range of 17AAG, radicicol, NSC683201, or the histone deacetylase inhibitor
TSA for 24 h. Cells were then fixed (3% formaldehyde, 0.25% glutaraldehyde,
0.25% Triton X-100) and blocked for 1 h in 5% milk in PBS at 37jC. Cells
were washed in 0.1% Tween 20/H2O and incubated with an antibody to
acetylated histone/protein (ab-193, Abcam Ltd., Cambridge, United
Kingdom) in PBS (1:2,000 dilution) for 1 h at 37jC. Cells were washed
again in 0.1% Tween 20/H2O and incubated with europium-labeled rabbit
IgG in DELFIA assay buffer (Perkin-Elmer Life And Analytical Sciences, Inc.,

Boston, MA; 0.2 Ag/mL) for 1 h at 37jC. Finally, enhancement solution
(Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, MA) was added to the cells, and the DELFIA
absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometric plate reader. Protein
measurements were then carried out on the same plate using the BCA
protein assay (Pierce). Results were corrected for protein concentration by
dividing the DELFIA absorbance by the protein absorbance, and results
were expressed as % control cells.

Results
Gene expression profiling following treatment with 17AAG,
an inactive analogue, and radicicol. 17AAG inhibits the growth of
A2780 human ovarian tumor cells with an IC50 for a 96-h treatment
of 12 nmol/L (7). A2780 cells were treated for 24 h with 60 nmol/L
17AAG (this equates to 5 IC50 or IC90 for the 96-h exposure) or
with an isoeffective concentration (600 nmol/L) of the chemically
dissimilar HSP90 inhibitor radicicol. To identify off-target effects,
cells were also treated with 60 nmol/L of the essentially inactive
4-aminobutyrate ester of 17AAG (NSC683201), which has no effect
on HSP90 ATPase activity or cancer cell proliferation up to a
concentration of 40 Amol/L (data not shown). In selecting an
equimolar concentration of NSC683201 and 17AAG, we considered
that effects of the chemical backbone (off-target) would be the same
when tested at the same equimolar concentration, whereas HSP90
(on-target) effects would be restricted to 17-AAG. Hence, both
compounds were used at 60 nmol/L. Control cells were treated with
vehicle (0.1% DMSO) for 24 h. cDNA microarrays of 4,132 cDNA
clones corresponding to genes of known identity were used to
analyze gene expression changes. The complete list of expression
changes in response to 17AAG, radicicol, and NSC683201 in A2780
cells is provided as Supplementary Data.
With all three compounds, the expression of the majority of
genes remained unchanged. Using Lowstra analysis (19), the
expression levels of 129, 47, and 12 genes (3%, 1%, and 0.3%) were
shown to be significantly (P < 0.02) increased or decreased at the
mRNA level with 17AAG, radicicol, and NSC683201, respectively
(Fig. 1A). The majority of these gene expression changes were
observed in response to only one of the compounds. However,
expression of 13 of 145 HSP90 inhibitor–responsive genes were
altered in response to both 17AAG and the chemically dissimilar
HSP90 inhibitor radicicol and could thus be classified as likely ontarget effects (Fig. 1A). Such on-target changes may be a direct
result of HSP90 inhibition or alternatively may be a consequence of
the downstream effects of HSP90 client protein depletion. We
reasoned that changes in mRNA expression that were seen with
both the active and inactive benzoquinone ansamycins, or with just
one of the three compounds examined, are less likely to be a
consequence of HSP90 inhibition and are more probable off-target
effects. Of interest, only one gene showed altered expression in
response to both of the benzoquinone ansamycins 17AAG and
NSC683201, although they share the same chemical backbone. In
addition, only one gene showed altered expression with both
radicicol and NSC683201, and a single gene exhibited decreased
expression with all three compound treatments.
Genes classified as significantly altered in expression at the
mRNA level following treatment with 17AAG are catalogued in
Table 1. Genes showing significant expression changes are grouped
according to their function, and genes for which the mRNAs that
exhibited a >2-fold increase are indicated in bold italics. Genes
corresponding to a number of HSPs were shown to exhibit
increased expression in response to both of the active HSP90
inhibitors but not NSC683201. These genes included HSC70,

HSP90b, and HSP47. Other genes exhibiting increased expression in
response to HSP90 inhibitors were involved in protein synthesis
and degradation, cell cycle, signal transduction, and RNA processing and transcription (Table 1). Genes with decreased expression at
the mRNA level following HSP90 inhibition were also grouped by
function. These functions include protein folding, protein synthesis
and degradation, signal transduction, cell cycle, RNA processing,
transcription, chromatin, transport, metabolism, apoptosis, cytoskeleton, and detoxification (Table 1).
By grouping genes showing significantly altered expression using
a self-organizing map, A2780 cells treated with isoeffective
concentrations of 17AAG and radicicol were shown to exhibit a
much more similar overall gene expression signature than that
obtained following treatment with the inactive 17AAG analogue
NSC683201 (Fig. 1B). On-target effects of HSP90 inhibition that
were identified using Lowstra analysis and listed in Table 1 were
also shown to be clustered together.
One cluster of genes with increased expression following HSP90
inhibition (Fig. 1B, #1) contained genes involved in the HSP90
chaperone complex, including the previously mentioned HSP90b,
HSC70, and HSP47 (Fig. 1B; Table 1). All of these genes were
induced in response to the two active HSP90 inhibitors, but less so
with the essentially inactive NSC683201 (Fig. 1B; Table 1). Because
HSP47 is known to stabilize and correctly fold procollagen, it
is particularly interesting that the expression of both procollagen
c-endopeptidase enhancer (PCOLCE) and procollagen-lysine, 2-oxyglutarate (PLOD) genes are also increased within this cluster.
Another interesting cluster (Fig. 1B, #2) contains the genes with
decreased expression in response to both of the active HSP90
inhibitors but increased expression with NSC683201 (Fig. 1B). This
corresponds to a gene cluster shown to be decreased in expression
in tumors from rectal cancer patients treated with 5-fluorouracil
(5-FU; ref. 21). These genes have been shown by other groups to be
regulated by MYC (22) and are marked with an asterisk in Table 1.
Two-dimensional proteomic analysis following 17AAG
treatment. Cell lysates were analyzed using two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis to detect changes in the A2780 proteome following
17AAG treatment. Figure 2A shows a typical two-dimensional gel of
A2780 control cell lysates. Using a 1.5-fold cutoff, the analysis
identified 42 altered protein spots, which accounted for f3% of
the total number of detectable proteins. From these 42 spots, 26
proteins could be annotated from the NCBI database. Table 2 lists
the names of identified proteins, their NCBI database accession
numbers, spot designation, experimental and reported isoelectric
point and molecular weight values, along with sequence coverage.
The functions of 17AAG-responsive proteins are listed in Table 3
with appropriate references.
A time-dependent induction of members of the molecular
chaperone machinery, including HSP72, HSC70, and HSP27, was
observed following 17AAG treatment (Table 2; Fig. 2B). In addition,
the mitochondrial HSP70 isoform mortalin-2 (GRP75/HSPA9B) was
also shown to be induced by 17AAG. HSP72 (spot nos. 366 and 326)
and HSP90h (spot nos. 138 and 142) were detectable in two protein
spots, most likely as a consequence of posttranslational modifications or alternative mRNA splicing. In addition, a protein spot
corresponding to the sequence encoded by C14ORF3 was induced
in a similar manner to HSP70 following 17AAG treatment. Further
studies published previously revealed that this protein was in fact a
novel cochaperone AHA1, which has an important role in the
activation of HSP90 ATPase activity (23). The targets of 17AAG,
HSP90a (HSPCA), and HSP90h protein levels were shown to

www.aacrjournals.org

increase at 8 h and decrease at 24 h (Table 2). Expression of
HnRNP3 (hnRNP 2H9A), a member of the heterogeneous nuclear
ribonucleoprotein family, was found to be decreased in response to
17AAG. This protein has been shown to be involved in early heat
shock–induced splicing arrest (24).
Another group of proteins showing altered expression following
17AAG treatment were those involved in the posttranslational
modifications of proteins, including histones. A decrease in the
expression of both HAT-1 and the protein methyltransferase PRMT5
(SKB1/JBP1) was observed in response to 17AAG (Table 2; Fig. 2B).
In addition, the levels of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) were
increased by 17AAG.

blotting. As a follow-up to the gene expression microarray and
two-dimensional proteomic gel analysis, a number of HSP changes
observed were analyzed in more detail using Western blotting. This
analysis was carried out on the same samples that were used in the
gene expression and proteomic screening so that the results were
directly comparable. c-RAF-1 was also studied because this and
other low-abundance client proteins were not detectable in the
proteomic profiling. Protein expression changes were examined
over a 72-h time course following treatment with 60 nmol/L
17AAG. As expected, depletion of the client protein c-RAF-1 by
17AAG was consistent with HSP90 being inhibited in the samples
used for gene expression and proteomic analysis (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B). HSP72 and HSP27 were induced in a timedependent manner by growth-inhibitory concentrations of 17AAG
and remained above control levels throughout the entire time
course (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Although HSF-1–dependent transcription of HSPs has been
observed previously in response to HSP90 inhibitors (23), it has not
been entirely clear whether this is truly an on-target effect of
HSP90 inhibition or a general stress response. To confirm whether
these responses were on-target effects of HSP90 inhibition, HSP
expression changes were assessed in A2780 cells treated with
isoeffective (5 IC50) concentrations of 17AAG or radicicol for 24 h.
In addition, these responses were also compared with those to
equimolar concentrations of 17AAG, radicicol, and NSC683201.
HSP72, HSC70, and HSP27 were confirmed as likely on-target
effects of HSP90 inhibition as their protein levels were induced by
growth-inhibitory concentrations of 17AAG and radicicol but
markedly less so by the much less active 17AAG analogue and
with the lower concentration of radicicol (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Interestingly, HSP90a protein expression was increased with all
three compounds, including the essentially inactive 17AAG
analogue, suggesting that increased HSP90a expression may not
solely be an on-target effect.
Detection of HSP27 induction in tumor biopsies from
patients treated with 17AAG. Protein expression changes in
response to drugs are increasingly used as potential pharmacodynamic end points in clinical studies and are essential for investigating new molecular targeted cancer therapies (25), including
HSP90 inhibitors (see ref. 6). Limited tumor biopsy samples were
available from patients treated with 17AAG. Supplementary Figure
S1C shows typical Western blots of tumor tissue taken from two
patients: one with melanoma and the other with mesothelioma
(ascitic fluid) before and after treatment with 450 mg/m2 17AAG
as part of a phase I clinical trial (10). As expected, both HSP72
induction and c-RAF-1 depletion were found to occur in tumor
tissue and cells following 17AAG treatment in these two patients.
In addition, the expression of HSP27 was also shown to increase in

NOTE: Cells were treated with a pharmacologically active concentration of 60 nmol/L 17AAG. mRNA expression was determined by cDNA
microarray profiling. All array experiments were replicated independently: 17AAG (n = 4), radicicol (n = 2), and NSC683201 (n = 2).
The Lowstra algorithm was used to identify genes that were outliers
(P < 0.02). Genes for which expression was also altered by radicicol
(600 nmol/L) or NSC683201 (60 nmol/L) are indicated by RAD or
INACTIVE, respectively. Genes in bold italics were altered >2-fold

these two patients following treatment with 17AAG and could
potentially be used as an additional pharmacodynamic marker in
the clinical evaluation of HSP90 inhibitors. Because HSP72, HSC70,
and HSP27 have antiapoptotic roles (3, 26), their increased
expression could be of therapeutic significance.
Effects of HSP90 inhibition on cellular protein acetylation.
As mentioned above, a number of proteins and genes involved in
cellular protein acetylation processes exhibited altered expression
after treatment of A2780 cells with 17AAG. The HAT-1 protein
showed reduced expression in response to 17AAG (Fig. 2B), with
a concomitant decrease observed at the mRNA level using cDNA
microarray analysis (Table 1). We hypothesized that changes in
the expression of chromatin-modifying enzymes could affect
acetylation of cellular proteins. An ELISA was used to examine

total protein acetylation in A2780 cells following exposure to
17AAG, radicicol, and the inactive 17AAG analogue NSC683201.
Interestingly, acetylation was inhibited 23% by both 17AAG and
radicicol (P < 0.05), whereas the inactive analogue had very little
effect on acetylation (Fig. 3A). As expected, the histone
deacetylase inhibitor TSA was shown to increase acetylation by
30% above control levels (P < 0.05; Fig. 3A). Of note, when 17AAG

was added together with TSA to the cells, a significant decrease
in acetylation was observed compared with both the untreated
control and TSA alone–treated cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 3A).
Combination studies of TSA with 17AAG gave a combination
index of 2.92 F 0.64 (SD, n = 3). This indicated an antagonistic
interaction that was consistent with the data from the acetylation
assay described above (Fig. 3B). These results show that

maximum depletion observed at 48 h using immunoblotting
(Fig. 4A, top). No change in PRMT5 mRNA expression was
observed in the cDNA microarray analysis, suggesting that the
reduced expression was mediated at the protein level. PRMT5

17AAG and radicicol in A2780 cells and not with the essentially
inactive analogue NSC683201 (Fig. 4A, bottom). Because depletion
following exposure to HSP90 inhibitors is a characteristic of HSP90
client proteins, we hypothesized that this may be the case for

PRMT5. Consistent with this hypothesis, immunoprecipitation
studies showed that PRMT5 was present in a complex with HSP90,
along with the known HSP90 client protein c-RAF-1 (Fig. 4B).

expression was decreased by exposure to the more potent
inhibitor VER-49009 but not by the much less potent
CCT018159 or CCT066961 (data not shown). Thus, PRMT5 is
identified as a protein depleted by HSP90 inhibitors and also as a
novel binding partner and potential client for HSP90.

not only by Western blotting (Fig. 4B) but also by MS. To check
the generality of the depletion of PRMT5 by 17AAG, we also
looked at the response of this protein to the drug in the HCT116
human colon cancer and WM266.4 human melanoma cell lines.
Figure 4C and D show that PRMT5 was depleted by 17AAG
treatment in both cell lines, as seen above in the A2780 ovarian
cancer cells. A time course study of PRMT5 depletion by 17AAG
was carried out in WM266.4 melanoma cells, and other relevant
biomarkers were also analyzed for direct comparison (Fig. 4C). A
time-dependent decrease in PRMT5 expression was seen alongside
depletion of client proteins c-RAF-1, ERBB2, CDK4, and AKT
together with an induction in HSP72 and HSP27. The kinetics of
PRMT5 depletion in WM266.4 cells were similar to those seen with
the established client protein AKT. In addition to the depletion of
PRMT5 by 17AAG and radicicol but not the inactive 17AAG
analogue NSC683201, we also carried out experiments with analogues of the novel diaryl pyrazole resorcinol series (5, 27, 28).

The aim of this study was to combine both mRNA expression
profiling and proteomics to investigate the molecular pharmacology of the HSP90 inhibitor 17AAG. The results illustrate the value
of using these two complementary methodologies together to study
the molecular responses to cancer drugs. Using this approach, we
have identified mRNAs and proteins that are modulated in
response to drug treatment and may contribute to the mode of
drug action. 17AAG was considered to be a good candidate
molecular therapeutic agent to study with this combined approach.
This was partly because treatment with the drug is already known
to lead to changes in the expression of several mRNAs and
proteins, as measured by conventional techniques (29), and partly
because there are likely to be complex and incompletely
understood molecular effects downstream of HSP90 inhibition. In
addition, there is considerable clinical interest in 17AAG that is
now in phase II clinical trials (10, 11). We reasoned that a more
comprehensive and systematic analysis would be a potentially
valuable approach because of its relative lack of bias. This study
describes the results of the mRNA and proteomic screening
together with follow-up work to validate selected known and new
findings and further studies to show the potential significance and
therapeutic application of the more novel observations.
The human genome is predicted to encode f20 to 25,000
proteins (30). Although limitations in two-dimensional gel
proteomics technology will restrict detection of certain subsets
of proteins (e.g., membrane-bound and low-abundance proteins;
ref. 31), f1,500 proteins from A2780 human ovarian cancer cells
were detectable on each two-dimensional gel. Currently, around
100 HSP90 client proteins have been identified.7 However, it is
possible that there are many more proteins that may require
HSP90 for their stability and function or which are regulated by
HSP90 in other ways. HSP90 client proteins are usually defined as
those that bind to HSP90 and are depleted upon treatment of cells
with HSP90 inhibitors. Roughly 3% of the proteins identified in the
proteomic analysis were shown to be responsive to 17AAG in the
A2780 ovarian cancer cell line. Many previously identified HSP90
client proteins were not detected, most likely because of their
relatively low abundance in this cell line. For example, c-RAF-1
was not detected. Depletion of this commonly studied client
protein was shown using immunoblotting of cell lysates obtained
from the same experiment (see Supplementary Fig. S1A and B),
confirming that the 17AAG exposures used in the expression
profiling studies were pharmacologically active. Although we
expected that c-RAF-1 and other low-abundance clients, particularly signal transduction proteins, would not be detected by the
technology used, we reasoned that the approach would potentially
be capable of identifying proteins that were not previously known
to be responsive to HSP90 inhibitors. We fully recognize that not
all proteins responsive to HSP90 inhibitors will be detected.
Nevertheless, the usefulness of the approach taken was exemplified

by our identification of several proteins not previously linked with
HSP90 inhibition or the cellular response to 17AAG. A number of
these need to be investigated further to determine whether they
are direct effects of HSP90 inhibition or a result of the downstream
consequences of HSP90 blockade. Of particular interest were the
changes in chromatin-related proteins and chromatin-modifying
enzymes. Given the novelty and potential significance of these
findings, we carried out follow-up studies on one of these proteins,
the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5.
Several 17AAG-responsive proteins were identified that are
known to be molecular chaperones. These included HSP90a,
HSP90h, HSP72, HSC70, and HSP27, along with the HSP90 ATPaseactivating cochaperone AHA1. The induction of HSP90h, HSP72,
and HSP27 was shown to be a direct consequence of HSP90
inhibition as defined by their increased expression with both
17AAG and the structurally distinct HSP90 inhibitor radicicol, but
not with the essentially inactive 17AAG analogue NSC683201. This
analogue was used at a concentration equimolar to that of 17AAG
to maximize the likelihood of identifying on-target HSP90 effects as
opposed to off-target effects due to the chemical backbone. In
addition to the protein changes, the gene expression profiling
studies showed that HSC70 and HSP90b expression was induced at
the mRNA level following treatment with the active HSP90 inhibitors but not the inactive 17AAG analogue, most likely indicative
of the major mechanism of transcriptional regulation of these
chaperones involving HSF-1 (32). Interestingly, however, unlike the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

other molecular chaperones, HSP90a protein expression was also
induced by the inactive 17AAG analogue as well as with 17AAG and
radicicol, suggesting that this was an off-target effect. Previous
reports have indicated that HSP90a is more readily induced by heat
shock than by mitogens, whereas the opposite is true for HSP90h,
although HSP90h can still be transcriptionally activated by HSF-1
(33, 34). Therefore, HSP90a induction may be indicative of a
general stress response, whereas HSP90h is a more robust
consequence of HSP90 inhibition.
Induction of both HSP72 and HSC70 isoforms by 17AAG was
observed by proteomic analysis in the A2780 ovarian tumor cell
line. In addition to these two HSP70 family members, mortalin-2
was shown to be responsive to 17AAG. In addition to its role as a
molecular chaperone, mortalin has been shown to regulate p53
activity (35). HSC70 mRNA expression was also induced, most likely
by transcriptional activation by HSF-1. Interestingly, increases in
the intensity of multiple protein spots containing HSP90 and
HSP70 family members were detected on the two-dimensional gels.
This suggests that different posttranslational modifications may be
present on these proteins, and further work is required to
determine the molecular nature of these forms.
The present study exemplifies in more detail than shown
previously the ability of the cell to mobilize an extended repertoire
of HSPs as a direct response to HSP90 inhibitors. The up-regulation
of a number of these HSP gene products will affect the response of
cancer cells to HSP90 inhibitors such as 17AAG. Clearly, increased

expression of HSP90 will replenish the cell reservoir of the drug
target and may potentially assist recovery from drug treatment.
Cellular recovery may also be aided by up-regulation of the major
HSP90 activator AHA1, which as mentioned earlier was initially
identified by our combined mRNA and proteomic profiling (23).
HSP27, HSP72, HSC70, and HSP90 have been shown to reduce the
apoptotic response through a number of different mechanisms
(36–38) and could therefore protect the cell against the effects of
HSP90 inhibitors. Indeed, a study published while this present
study was being finalized has confirmed that HSP27 expression is
increased by 17AAG, and that depletion of HSP27 causes
sensitization to 17AAG (26).
The expression of an additional chaperone gene HSP47 was also
shown here to be increased by treatment with HSP90 inhibitors.
HSP47 is a molecular chaperone that interacts with and stabilizes
correctly folded procollagen (39). Procollagen interacts with
unfolded polypeptides in the endoplasmic reticulum and increases
their period of retention in this organelle, thereby allowing time for
adequate protein folding and quality control checks. HSP47 is
transcriptionally regulated by HSF-1 and has been shown to be
induced by transforming growth factor-h and interleukins (40).
Interestingly, clustering of the gene expression data using a selforganizing map identified a number of mRNAs corresponding to
enzymes involved in procollagen function in the same cluster as
HSP47 (Fig. 1B). A recent study has shown that HSP47 is silenced
by methylation in a number of different tumor types, and that lack
of HSP47 results in increased collagen I and IV levels (41). In
addition, neuroblastoma cell lines that expressed low levels of
HSP47 and high levels of collagen I were highly tumorigenic in
nude mice (41). Therefore, HSP47 induction by HSP90 inhibitors
could be of therapeutic benefit, at least in some tumor types.
We observed that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein
hnRNP3 (hnRNP 2H9A) showed decreased expression in response
to 17AAG. As a member of the hnRNP H subfamily, this gene shares
78% identity with hnRNP F. Of interest, in addition to the
involvement of hnRNP3 in early heat shock–induced splicing arrest
(24), a very recent study has reported that several hnRNPs and
small heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein were identified as
part of a complex with HSP90, the regulatory and catalytic subunits
of DNA-dependent protein kinase, various RNA helicases, poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, and the osmotic regulatory transcription factor (TonEBP/OREBP) in human embryonic kidney cells (42).
This suggests a role for the interaction of HSP90 and hnRNPs in
regulating gene transcription.
An interesting finding from the cDNA gene expression profiling
was the identification of a large number of genes that showed
reduced expression in response to HSP90 inhibitors, the levels of
which were also decreased in tumor tissue of rectal cancer patients
treated with 5-FU (21). This group of genes have been shown by
other investigators to be positively regulated by c-MYC (22).
HSP90a is a target gene of c-MYC, and overexpression and
knockout of HSP90 increased or decreased, respectively, the
transforming activity of c-MYC in HeLa and RatMyc cells (43). In
addition, the HSP90 cochaperone CDC37 has been shown to act as
an oncogene and collaborates with cyclin D and c-MYC in cellular
transformation (44). It is possible that the decreased expression of
the MYC-regulated gene set is a consequence of cell cycle arrest by
17AAG. However, this may also contribute to the therapeutic
effects of HSP90 inhibitors.
As mentioned, of particular interest to us was a group of proteins
identified in the present proteomic analysis as being responsive to

www.aacrjournals.org

17AAG and that are known to have a role in chromatin methylation
and acetylation. These were HAT-1, the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5, and the non-histone protein HP1 protein. Levels
of the HP1 protein were increased in response to 17AAG treatment.
HP1 interacts with numerous proteins and has been shown to be
important in heterochromatin regulation, specifically binding to
histone H3 when methylated on Lys9 by the methyltransferase Suv39
(45). The expression of HAT-1, which is required for DNA replication
(46), was decreased following 17AAG treatment. Interestingly, we
showed that total protein acetylation was decreased in cells in
response to HSP90 inhibitors. There is clearly a complex interaction
between protein acetylation and HSP90, not least because it has been
reported that histone deacetylase inhibitors may inhibit the
chaperone by increasing HSP90 acetylation (47, 48). The link
between HSP90 and chromatin biology is also emerging from
studies in model organisms (49, 50). The present results suggest
further complexity by showing that HSP90 inhibitors reduce the
expression of at least one member of each of HAT, protein arginine
methyltransferase, and HP families as well as showing that cellular
protein acetylation is reduced by 17AAG, even in the presence of an
histone deacetylase inhibitor.
The contrasting effects of 17AAG and the histone deacetylase
inhibitor TSA on histone acetylation in A2780 ovarian cancer cells
suggested the possibility of an antagonistic interaction on cell
proliferation. This prediction was confirmed by median effect
analysis. In agreement with our findings, another study has shown
that geldanamycin inhibits TSA-induced cell death and histone H4
hyperacetylation in COS-7 cells (51). Interestingly, the combination
of 17AAG and another histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA has been
shown to be synergistic with respect to apoptosis in leukemia cells
(52). This may indicate that the outcome of such combination will
be dependent on the type of cancer concerned. Further studies are
required to investigate such differences in more detail.
An especially significant finding was our observation of depletion
by 17AAG of the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 (53),
which led us to identify this chromatin-modifying enzyme as a novel
HSP90-binding protein and potential client. Depletion of PRMT5 by
17AAG was reproducibly seen in three different human cancer cell
lines (ovarian, colon, and melanoma). PRMT5 showed decreased
expression over time following treatment with 17AAG, and the
kinetics of depletion was similar to AKT in WM266.4 human
melanoma cells. Depletion was shown to be an on-target effect of
HSP90 inhibition, as observed by its decreased expression with
17AAG and radicicol but not with the essentially inactive 17AAG
analogue NSC683201. In addition, PRMT5 depletion was seen with
the potent HSP90-inhibitory diaryl pyrazole resorcinol VER-49009
but not with much less active analogues. Immunoprecipitation
studies with analysis by Western blotting and MS confirmed that
PRMT5 was complexed with HSP90. This is the first time that a
protein arginine methyltransferase has been suggested to be a
protein HSP90 client protein. In addition, a recent study has shown
that HSP90a enhanced the activity of a lysine-specific histone
methyltransferase SMYD3 (54). Modulation of PRMT5 by 17AAG
may be of particular significance given that it negatively regulates
expression of the ST7 and NM23 human suppressor genes (53).
Pharmacodynamic markers are essential for the rational
development of molecular therapeutics, including HSP90 inhibitors (10, 55, 56). They can be used to show proof of concept for
the proposed mechanism of drug action in phase I studies as well
as to help select the optimal dose and schedule. However, the
measurement of molecular end points in clinical trials of new

molecular therapeutics remains disappointingly infrequent (25).
Simultaneous induction of HSP70 family members accompanied
by depletion of client proteins, such as ERBB2, c-RAF-1, and
CDK4, was shown to be a characteristic and robust molecular
signature of HSP90 inhibition (10, 29, 55). Here, we have extended
our molecular profiling studies to show that the expression of
HSP27 was not only induced by various HSP90 inhibitors,
although not with the less active analogues, but in addition
was increased in tumor tissue taken from two patients
participating in the phase I clinical trial of 17AAG carried out
at our institution (10). Only limited tumor biopsy samples are
available from patients treated with 17AAG in the phase I studies.
Further studies are required to investigate the significance and
broader usefulness of this observation and also the potential
value of other potential biomarkers identified in our study.
Nevertheless, the result exemplifies how proteomic profiling can
identify biomarkers of potential clinical utility. Furthermore, given
that HSP27 and HSP70 family members are antiapoptotic (3, 26),
the demonstration of the induction of these proteins in human
tumor tissue following treatment of patients with 17AAG highlights the importance of considering these molecular responses as
potential resistance mechanisms. In addition, the results support
the development of inhibitory strategies directed against these
antiapoptotic HSPs (26).
In conclusion, the combination of mRNA and protein profiling
has confirmed some of the responses already known to occur with
17AAG, thereby validating the methodology. In addition, the
combined screening approach has also uncovered a number of
very interesting and potentially important proteins and mRNAs not
previously known to be affected by 17AAG. The incorporation into
this study of an essentially inactive 17AAG analogue and of
structurally dissimilar HSP90 inhibitor chemotypes, together with
much less active analogues of these, was useful in determining
whether molecular changes were likely to be on-target effects of
HSP90 inhibition. Protein expression did not always correlate with
gene expression changes, illustrating the value of complementary
gene profiling and proteomic approaches. Several HSPs and
cochaperones were induced in response to HSP90 inhibitors, and,
when taken together with depletion of client proteins, these
provide a particularly robust molecular signature of HSP90
inhibition. In addition, a number of genes involved in protein
synthesis and degradation, RNA processing, transcription, cell
cycle, apoptosis, and signal transduction showed altered expression
in response to HSP90 inhibitors. The series of mRNA and protein
changes observed may shed light on the likely complex mechanism

of action of the first-in-class HSP90 inhibitor 17AAG. Of particular
novelty and interest were the changes in the expression of proteins
involved in chromatin acetylation and methylation. Total cellular
acetylation was decreased by treatment with HSP90 inhibitors,
providing some evidence that acetylation of histones and other
proteins may contribute to the mechanism of action of HSP90
inhibitors. Decreased expression of hnRNP3 suggests possible
effects on transcription. These observations add to the accumulating evidence for a dynamic interplay among HSP90, chromatin
biology, and gene transcription (49, 50) and suggest that this
interaction may have a therapeutic dimension in cancer. Furthermore, based on the demonstration by proteomic profiling of
protein depletion by HSP90 inhibition and supported by immunoprecipitation studies, the protein arginine methyltransferase
PRMT5 was identified as a protein depleted by HSP90 inhibitors
and also as a novel HSP90-binding partner and potential client
protein. In addition, the antagonistic effects of 17AAG and TSA on
protein acetylation in cells were shown to be associated with an
antagonistic interaction on cell proliferation, consistent with the
effects of 17AAG on chromatin-modifying enzymes. Another
interesting observation was the decreased expression of a group
of genes regulated by MYC. These various molecular responses help
to shed light on the complex mechanism of action of HSP90
inhibitors and provide potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers of
drug effect, including our demonstration of increased HSP27
elevation in tumor tissue of patients receiving 17AAG. Of the
various findings emerging from our screen, we regard the novel
observations seen with chromatin-modifying enzymes and related
proteins as particularly worthy of further study. Finally, because
this study has exemplified the value and complementary nature of
both gene expression and proteomic profiling in understanding the
molecular pharmacology of HSP90 inhibitors, the combined use of
these two approaches can be recommended for research on other
molecularly targeted therapeutics.
