ABSTRACT:
BACKGROUND: Thymomas and thymic carcinoma are rare tumors with no
approved therapies. Our purpose was to analyze the molecular features and outcomes
of patients referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy (Phase I Clinic).
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of consecutive
referred patients with advanced/metastatic thymoma or thymic carcinoma
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were identified (median age 52 years; 10
women; median number of prior systemic therapies = 2). Six of 10 patients (60%)
treated with mTOR inhibitor combination regimens achieved stable disease (SD) ≥12
months or a partial response (PR). For patients treated on mTOR inhibitor regimens
(N = 10), median time to treatment failure (TTF) was 11.6 months versus 2.3
months on last conventional regimen prior to referral (p=0.024). Molecular analyses
(performed by next generation sequencing in seven patients and single polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)-based assays in an additional six patients) showed diverse
actionable mutations: PIK3CA (1 of 12 tested; 8%); EGFR (1 of 13; 8%); RET (1 of
7; 14%); and AKT1 (1 of 7; 14%). Of two patients with PIK3CA or AKT1 mutations,
one was treated with an mTOR inhibitor-based regimen and achieved 26% regression
with a TTF of 17 months.
CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced/metastatic thymoma or thymic
carcinoma demonstrated prolonged TTF on mTOR inhibitor-based therapy as compared
to prior conventional treatment. Heterogeneity in actionable molecular aberrations
was observed, suggesting that multi-assay molecular profiling and individualizing
treatment merits investigation.

INTRODUCTION

in advanced stages are typically aggressive. Thymic
carcinomas are malignant epithelial tumors without the
thymus-like features of thymomas[3]. The molecular
pathogenesis of these tumors remains poorly elucidated,
although retrospective case studies have demonstrated
the presence of rare molecular aberrations in important
oncogenes (EGFR, HER2, KIT, KRAS, and BCL2), and

Thymic epithelial tumors include thymomas
and thymic carcinomas. Though rare (0.2-1.5% of all
malignancies)[1], they represent the most common tumor
of the anterior mediastinum[2]. Thymomas account for
approximately 20 percent of mediastinal tumors and,

tumor suppressor genes (TP53, and CDKN2A/B)[4-9].
Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for
early stage disease[10]. Advanced/metastatic disease is
treated with multimodality therapy including induction
chemotherapy, surgery and radiation/chemotherapy[5].
Combination chemotherapy regimens used most often,
either alone or as part of multimodality therapy, include
cisplatin, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (PAC)
with or without prednisone, cisplatin, doxorubicin,
cyclophosphamide and vincristine (ADOC), etoposide
and cisplatin (EP), and, etoposide, cisplatin and ifosfamide
(VIP)[10]. Anecdotal responses to mTOR inhibitors have
been reported[11, 12]. Herein, we describe the clinical
and molecular characteristics and outcomes of 21 patients
with advanced/metastatic thymoma or thymic carcinoma
referred to the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy (Phase
I Clinic).

Patient Characteristics
A total of 21 consecutive patients with advanced/
metastatic thymoma or thymic carcinoma were referred to
the Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy (Phase I Clinic).
Their median age was 52 years (range, 26-73 years) (Table
1). Ten patients (48%) were women. The median number
of prior therapies in the metastatic setting was 2 (range,
0-6). The most common metastatic sites were lung, pleura,
and lymph nodes.

Molecular analyses
Of 12 patients assessed for a PIK3CA mutation (7
by NGS; 6 by single gene PCR sequencing, including
one of whom was also assessed by NGS), one patient
(8%; case #16, Table 2) had a PIK3CA mutation (S553T)
in exon 9. One of the 13 patients (8%) assessed for an
EGFR mutation (7 by NGS; 8 by single gene PCR-based

sequencing including 2 who also had NGS) had a mutation
(case #4, Table 2; T785I in exon 20) in the sample obtained
five years prior to referral. Of interest no EGFR mutation
was found by NGS in the sample obtained from a separate
site, one year after referral. Twelve patients assessed for a
KRAS mutation, 9 for an NRAS mutation, and 9 for a BRAF
mutation, were all wild-type. None of the 6 patients (cases
#3, 4, 12, 14, 15, and 16, Table 2) evaluated for expression
of PTEN by IHC had PTEN loss and none of the 7 patients
evaluated by NGS showed PTEN abnormalities (total=11
patients evaluated for PTEN since two had both NGS and
PTEN by IHC).
NGS analyses were performed on tissues obtained
from seven patients. One patient (case #4, Table 2) had
an APC mutation (E1536), TP53 mutation (R282W) and
MCL1 amplification. A second patient (case #8, Table 2)
had a RET mutation (E768Q) and CDKN2A/B deletion.

Treatment
The median number of phase I trials per patient
was one (range, 1-6). For patients treated on more than
one phase I trial, we report the data from the phase I trial
with the best response. Twenty patients were treated on 13
different phase I clinical trials (Table 2 and Supplemental
Table 1). Most patients (n=17, 81%) received treatment
with regimens that included at least one targeted agent,
including 10 patients who received treatment with mTOR
inhibitor combination therapies.

Response to treatment

TTF on phase I protocol compared to TTF on
prior therapy

Of 21 patients on this study, 19 were evaluable
for response (Table 2; Figure 1). Two patients were not
evaluable for response. One of these patients had not
yet been restaged at the time of data analysis and the
other patient was not enrolled on a trial (cases #14 and
13 respectively; Table 2). Of the 19 patients evaluable for
response, nine patients (47%) attained either a PR (n=3;
cases #5, 11 and 19; Table 2) or SD ≥12 months (n=6;
cases #2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 17; Table 2). Four patients came
off study prior to post-treatment imaging evaluation due to
clinical progression (all of whom were arbitrarily graphed
as 20% progression in Figure 1). Six of 10 patients (60%;
cases #4, 6, 8, 12, 17, and 19; Table 2) treated with an
mTOR inhibitor containing regimen achieved SD ≥12
months/PR. Three of nine evaluable patients (33%; cases
#2, 5, and 11, Table 2) treated with other agents achieved
SD ≥12 months/PR. TTF of ≥12 months was achieved
by six of 10 patients on an mTOR inhibitor-containing
regimen (cases #4, 6, 8, 12, 17, and 19; Table 2; TTF
= 12, 18+, 12+, 14, 17, and 12+ months, respectively)
versus one of 10 patients treated with other agents (case
#2; Table 2; TTF = 25 months) (p = 0.057). One of two
patients (cases #16 and 17, Table 2) with a mutation in the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis was treated with an mTOR-based
regimen and achieved 26% regression with a TTF of 17
months (case #17, Table 2).
Figure 2

We analyzed the median TTF on a phase I
study versus median TTF for the therapy immediately
preceding referral to the phase I clinic. Two patients
were not included in the paired analysis as one patient
did not receive a phase I trial (case #13, Table 2) and a
second patient did not receive prior systemic therapy for
advanced cancer (case #17, Table 2). The median TTF
was significantly longer on a phase I trial (4.5 months,
95% CI, 0.3–8.7 months) compared to median TTF on
the last therapy before referral to phase I (3.0 months,
95% CI, 1.3–4.7 months; p=0.008; Figure 2A). We also
analyzed the median TTF in a sub-group of patients on
mTOR inhibitor-based combinations. The median TTF
was significantly longer in nine patients (one patient [case
#17; Table 2] was not included in the paired analysis as the
patient did not receive prior systemic therapy for advanced
cancer) treated on mTOR inhibitor combinations (11.6
months, 95% CI, 0.0–30.9 months) compared to median
TTF on their last standard therapy prior to referral to
the phase I clinic (2.3 months, 95% CI, 1.7–2.9 months;
p=0.024; Figure 2B).

Overall Survival
The median follow-up duration of surviving patients
from the date of presentation to the phase I clinic was 21.4

these aberrations is potentially actionable, it is apparent
that treating all patients with any one targeted agent
would likely be successful in only a very small subset of
patients, at best. These observations underscore the need
for investigating rational multiplex molecular diagnostics
paired with matched targeted therapy [16].
In our analysis of patients treated on targeted
therapies, however, six of 10 individuals (60%) who
received mTOR inhibitor combination therapies attained
either SD ≥12 months (n=5) or a PR (n=1). Results
of molecular analyses were available for five of the six
patients including four who had NGS analysis. One of the
five patients (case #17, Table 2) had an AKT1 mutation,
and achieved tumor regression of 26% that lasted 17
months. The underlying basis of response of the other
patients is unclear. It may be that some of the aberrations
observed result in crosstalk with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway. Alternatively, additional transcriptome or
proteosome analysis might reveal aberrations or signatures
indicative of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation.
Three of the nine evaluable patients treated with
agents that did not include an mTOR inhibitor achieved
SD ≥12 months/PR. Of interest, one patient (case #2;
Table 2) treated with a TRAIL receptor-2 agonist, attained
SD for 25 months versus TTF of four months on last
therapy before referral to the phase I clinic. NGS analysis
performed on this patient’s tissue did not identify any
molecular aberrations. A planned in-depth analysis of
RNA/proteomics may help to understand the prolonged
stable disease observed in this patient. Two other patients
(cases #5 and 11, Table 2) achieved a PR, albeit of shorter
duration (5 and 7 months), on decitabine (hypomethylating
agent) and patupilone (microtubule inhibitor), respectively.
One patient (case #4, Table 2) showed an EGFR
mutation in sample tissue obtained five years prior to
referral. NGS performed on tissue obtained one year post
referral failed to discern this mutation. These observations
confirm the complexity of tumor heterogeneity[17]. Other
aberrations included mutations in APC, a tumor suppressor
gene often altered in colorectal cancer[18], or in p53[4,
19]. MCL1 amplification implicated in antiapoptic
activity[20], and loss of CDKN2A/B, a gene that encodes
inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases[9, 21] were also

months (range, 9.6 – 59.5 months). The median OS from
the time of diagnosis of advanced/metastatic thymoma
or thymic carcinoma to death or last follow up was 85.7
months (95% CI, 40.8 – 130.6 months). The median OS
from the date of presentation to the phase I program was
29.2 months (95% CI, 18.7-39.7 months). At the time of
analysis, 15 patients were dead.

DISCUSSION
Advanced/metastatic thymomas and thymic
carcinoma exhibit aggressive behavior[4, 13]. They
are a distinct clinical entity associated with worse
prognosis despite multimodal approach[14], which
underscores the urgent need for the development of novel
therapeutic approaches. The purpose of this study was to
systematically analyze the clinical outcomes of 21 patients
with advanced/metastatic thymoma and thymic carcinoma
referred to a phase I clinic.
In this analysis, we observed that 9 of 19 patients
(47%) evaluable for response achieved either SD ≥12
months (n=6) or a PR (n=3) (Table 2; Figure 1). This
includes six of 10 patients (60%) treated on mTOR
inhibitor combination therapies. TTF ≥12 months was
achieved by six of 10 patients on an mTOR inhibitorcontaining regimen versus one of 10 patients treated
with other agents (p=0.057). Patients treated on mTOR
inhibitor-containing phase I regimens also demonstrated a
significantly longer TTF (median=11.6 months) compared
to the TTF on the therapy they received prior to referral to
phase I (median=2.3 months) (p=0.024; Figure 2B). Prior
anecdotal responses to mTOR inhibitors have previously
been reported as well[11, 12]
Though several signaling pathways have been
explored in thymic tumors, clinical trials with EGFR,
KIT, VEGF, and IGF-1R, histone deacetylase, DNA
methyltransferase, tropomyosin receptor kinase A, and,
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors documented only
modest clinical responses in advanced disease[4, 5,
15]. Our results show that thymic tumors have diverse
molecular abnormalities. For instance, one of 12 patients
(8%) harbored a PIK3CA mutation; one of 13 (8%), an
EGFR mutation; one of seven (14%), a RET mutation; and

seen (Table 2).
This study has several important limitations. The
small sample size and retrospective nature of the analysis
precludes robust statistical evaluation. In this context, the
study should be considered hypothesis-generating. The
responses with mTOR-based regimens are of potential
interest, but could have been confounded by the use of
combination therapy. In this regard, anthracyclines are
known to be active in thymic cancer[4, 22]. However,
three of the five patients with TTF ≥12 months who were
treated with a regimen that contained both an mTOR
inhibitor and an anthracycline had received a prior
anthracycline containing regimen.
In conclusion, advances in the treatment of
advanced/metastatic thymoma and thymic carcinoma are
hampered by the rarity of these conditions. No drugs are
approved for these tumors. Our study showed that six of
10 patients (60%) treated on mTOR inhibitor-containing
regimen attained a SD ≥12 months/PR. The TTF on
mTOR inhibitor combination therapies was significantly
longer than the TTF on the last conventional therapy
prior to referral to the phase I clinic (median of 11.6 vs.
2.3 months; p=0.024; Figure 2B). Diverse actionable
molecular aberrations were seen in our patients including,
but not limited to, mutations in PIK3CA (1 of 12 tested;
8%); EGFR (1 of 13; 8%); RET (1 of 7; 14%); and AKT1
(1 of 7; 14%). Other aberrations were also observed:
TP53 mutation, APC mutation, MCL1 amplification, and,
CDK2A/B deletion. These observations highlight the
heterogeneity between patients, and suggest that treating
unselected patients with any one regimen is unlikely
to achieve high partial or complete remission rates.
Furthermore, two patients tested by NGS each had several
abnormalities, making tailored treatment more complex.
Of interest, three of seven patients tested by NGS showed
no abnormality; further evaluation of this disease using
transcriptome and/or proteomic analysis may therefore
be necessary in order to fully understand its underlying
biology.

Assessments, including history, physical examination,
and laboratory evaluations, were done as specified in
each protocol, typically before the initiation of therapy,
weekly during the first cycle, and then, at a minimum, at
the beginning of each new treatment cycle. Efficacy was
assessed from computed tomography (CT) scans and/or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline before
treatment initiation and then about every two cycles
(six to eight weeks). All radiographs were read in the
Department of Radiology at MD Anderson and reviewed
in the Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics
tumor measurement clinic.

Molecular assays
All histologies were centrally reviewed at MD
Anderson Cancer Center.
Molecular testing was
dependent on availability of appropriately processed
tissue; furthermore, assay availability evolved with time.
Molecular testing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)based DNA sequencing (EGFR, NRAS, KRAS, BRAF and
PIK3CA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for PTEN
(DAKO antibody, Carpinteria, CA) were performed
in the clinical laboratory improvement amendment
(CLIA)-certified Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory at MD
Anderson as described in previous publications[23-26]
Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed
at Foundation Medicine (Cambridge, MA) in seven
patients with available tissue. Genomic libraries were
captured for 3230 exons in 182 cancer-related genes plus
37 introns from 14 genes often rearranged in cancer and
sequenced to average median depth of 734X with 99% of
bases covered >100X.

End Points and Statistical Methods
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the
baseline patients’ characteristics. The Fisher’s exact test
was used to assess the association between categorical
variables. Responses were categorized per RECIST
1.0 criteria[27] and were reported as best response.
3D-waterfall plot was used to illustrate the responses and
their duration in these patients as previously described[28].
Overall survival (OS) was measured from the date of
presentation to the phase I clinical trials program at MD
Anderson until death from any cause or last follow-up.
Patients still alive were censored for survival at the time
of their last follow-up. Time-to-treatment failure (TTF)
was defined as the time interval between the start of
therapy and the date of disease progression or death or
removal from study for any reason, whichever occurred
first. Patients alive and without disease progression were
censored at the last follow-up date. For patients treated
on more than one phase I clinical trial, data from the
best response phase I clinical trial was used for analysis.

METHODS
We reviewed the electronic medical records of
consecutive patients with advanced/metastatic thymoma
or thymic carcinoma referred to the Department of
Investigational Cancer Therapeutics (Phase I Clinical
Trials Program) at The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center beginning January 1, 2006. This study
and all treatments were carried out in accordance with
the guidelines of the MD Anderson Cancer Center
Institutional Review Board.
Treatment was determined after clinical, pathologic
and laboratory data were reviewed. Phase I clinical trials
available for patient enrollment varied over time depending
upon protocol availability at the time of presentation to
the phase I clinic (Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy).

The Kaplan-Meier method [29] was used to estimate
the probabilities of OS and TTF, and log-rank tests [30]
were utilized to compare subgroups of patients. All tests
were 2-sided, and P <0.05 was considered statistically
significant. All statistical analyses were carried out using
SPSS (version 19.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
