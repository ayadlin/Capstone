ABSTRACT
RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) acts as a damage sensor for transcription-coupled
nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) and undergoes proteolytic clearance from damaged
chromatin by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Here, we report that Valosincontaining protein (VCP)/p97, a druggable oncotarget, is essential for RNAPII’s
proteolytic clearance in mammalian cells. We show that inhibition of VCP/p97, or
siRNA-mediated ablation of VCP/p97 and its cofactors UFD1 and UBXD7 severely
impairs ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced RNAPII degradation. VCP/p97 interacts
with RNAPII, and the interaction is enhanced by Cockayne syndrome B protein (CSB).
However, the VCP/p97-mediated RNAPII proteolysis occurs independent of CSB.
Surprisingly, CSB enhances UVR-induced RNAPII ubiquitination but delays its turnover.
Additionally, VCP/p97-mediated RNAPII turnover occurs with and without Von HippelLindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), a known substrate receptor of Elongin E3
ubiquitin ligase for RNAPII. Moreover, pVHL re-expression improves cell viability
following UVR. Whereas, VCP/p97 inhibition decreases cell viability and enhances a
low-dose UVR killing in presence of pVHL. These findings reveal a function of VCP/p97
segregase in UVR-induced RNAPII degradation in mammalian cells, and suggest a role
of CSB in coordinating VCP/p97-mediated extraction of ubiquitinated RNAPII and CSB
itself from chromatin.

INTRODUCTION

RNAPII by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) has
been shown to resolve stalled RNAPII [1].
Proteolysis of RNAPII is a tightly regulated
multistep process involving ubiquitination of RNAPII,
release of the ubiquitin conjugates from chromatin,
and proteolytic processing by proteasome. In yeast,
ubiquitination of Rpb1, the large subunit of RNAPII, is
conducted by a cooperative action of Rsp5 E3 ubiquitin
ligase [2] and an Elongin ubiquitin ligase complex, which
contains Ela1 (Elongin A), Cul3, Elc1 (Elongin C) and
Rbx1 [3, 4]. In mammals, several E3 ubiquitin ligases
including BRCA1-BARD ligase [5, 6], Nedd4 ligase [7]

Transcription is one of fundamental processes
in living cells. Transcriptional elongation by RNA
polymerase II (RNAPII) often encounters obstacles,
including DNA damage, chromatin structures and
molecular machineries of other DNA-templated processes,
which can cause elongating RNAPII to stall or arrest. The
irreversibly arrested RNAPII, e.g., at ultraviolet radiation
(UVR)-induced photolesions, can become an obstruction
to DNA replication and DNA repair machineries and is
highly deleterious to cells. In yeast, so far, proteolysis of

and mammalian counterpart Elongin ubiquitin ligase
complex [8–11] were reported to ubiquitinate damagearrested RNAPII. The Elongin ubiquitin ligase complex
uses Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein
(pVHL) as a substrate receptor for RNAPII ubiquitination
[9]. It has been known that the pVHL protein directly
binds Elongin BC complex and inhibits transcription
elongation [12].
Release of ubiquitinated Rpb1 from chromatin
in yeast requires the function of Cdc48-Ufd11-Npl4
segregase protein complex, its adaptor proteins Ubx4 and
Ubx5 [13], as well as chromatin remodeler INO80 [14].
CDC48 protein, also known as Valosin-containing
protein (VCP)/p97, is a member of an evolutionally
conserved AAA (ATPase-associated with various cellular
activities) family [15]. CDC48 plays a well-established
role in segregating ubiquitinated substrates from protein
complexes, aggregates, membranes and chromatin
[16–18]. VCP/p97 cooperates with different sets of
mutually exclusive cofactors and adaptors for different
cellular functions [19]. The cofactor UFD1 and NPL4
are the known VCP/p97 substrate-recruiting cofactors,
which are needed for extracting the misfolded proteins
from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane during ERassociated degradation [20–23]. Yeast Ubx5 is a member
of UBA-UBX protein family. Its mammalian counterpart
protein UBXD7 is involved in VCP/p97-mediated
extraction of ubiquitinated DNA damage sensors DDB2,
XPC and Cockayne syndrome B protein (CSB) from
damaged chromatin [24–26].
Lesion-stalled elongating RNAPII also triggers
transcription-coupled repair processes. For example,
photolesion-stalled RNAPII, together with CSB, initiates
transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER)
[27, 28]. In the process of TC-NER, DNA lesion stabilizes
the interaction between RNAPII with CSB [29, 30]. The
RNAPII-CSB complex recruits Cockayne syndrome
A protein (CSA), transcription factor II H (TFIIH) and
other core NER factors, as well as non-NER factors to the
lesion sites [31]. Once a lesion is verified by TFIIH, the
stalled RNAPII along with other components of elongating
machinery backtracks or is resolved, and the transcription
elongation process is funneled into assembling preincision
complex of NER.
How the stalled RNAPII, along with elongating
machinery, at DNA lesion, is resolved in mammalian
cells has not been assessed experimentally. The issue
is complicated not only by the participation of multiple
E3 ubiquitin ligases for RNAPII ubiquitination but
also by the involvement of CSB and CSA in RNAPII
ubiquitination and degradation [32, 33]. In this study, we
have experimentally defined the role of VCP/p97 in UVRinduced RNAPII degradation in mammalian cells. We
showed that VCP/p97-mediated UVR-induced RNAPII
occurs regardless of the CSB status. We also examined
the physical interaction between VCP/p97 and RNAPII,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the UVR-induced RNAPII ubiquitination and turnover,
as well as the role of CSB in these processes. We further
provide evidence that UVR-induced degradation of
RNAPII via the cooperative action of pVHL-containing
Elongin E3 ubiquitin ligase and VCP/p97 is critical for
cell viability following UVR.

RESULTS
VCP/p97 inhibition prevents UVR-induced
degradation of RNAPII
To determine whether VCP/p97 is involved in UVRinduced degradation of RNAPII in mammalian cells,
we first examined the effect of VCP/p97 inhibition on
proteolysis of RNAPII by DBeQ, a specific small molecule
inhibitor of VCP/p97 ATPase [34]. The RNAPII levels in
HCT116 cells at 50 J/m2 exhibited a clear and progressive
decrease from 2 to 8 h following UVR. Individual
treatments of cells with DBeQ or MG132 prevented
RNAPII degradation (Figure 1A). It is noteworthy that
anti-RNAPII H5 antibody primarily recognizes Pol
IIo forms, but the Pol IIa forms can be observed by
optimizing gel separations and exposure times during
Western blotting. These forms of RNAPII were essentially
characterized and annotated in previous studies [35] and
were further confirmed in this study by independent set
of RNAPII antibodies (Supplementary Figure S1). The
slow-migrating modified RNAPII forms were seen at 2 h
regardless of the inhibitor treatment and the overall results
were consistent with previous observations of RNAPII
ubiquitination induced by UVR [35]. At 10 J/m2, UVRinduced RNAPII degradation was discernible but not
prominent in HCT116 cells (Figure 1B). However, DBeQ
elevated the levels of RNAPII. Because ubiquitin specific
protease 7 (USP7) was implicated in protecting RNAPII
from proteasomal degradation [36, 37], we compared the
dynamics of RNAPII levels following UVR in parental
HCT116 and HCT116-derived USP7 knockout cells
(Supplementary Figure S1). The UVR-induced RNAPII
degradation exhibited a similar dose-dependent response
in both HCT116 and USP7-deficient cells. At 50 J/m2,
MG132 and DBeQ also prevented RNAPII degradation in
USP7-deficient HCT116 cells. Taken together, these results
indicate that VCP/p97 is involved in ubiquitin-mediated
RNAPII degradation regardless of the status of USP7.

VCP/p97 functions in RNAPII degradation in
the presence of CSB
Because Cockayne syndrome proteins are suggested
to play a role in UVR-induced ubiquitination and
degradation of RNAPII [32, 33], we first investigated
VCP/p97 function in RNAPII degradation in the presence
of CSB by employing corrected CSB-deficient CS1AN
cells, which harbor Doxycycline (Dox)-inducible CSB

transgenes (Figure 2A). In these cells, the Dox-induced
CSB expression and UV-induced CSB degradation were
confirmed upon 24-h Dox induction and withdrawal
(Figures 4A and 6A). More importantly, UV irradiation
reduced the steady-state level of RNAPII in the presence
of CSB. As expected, the loss of RNAPII was again
prevented by VCP/p97 inhibition, indicating the loss of
RNAPII requires VCP/p97 function.
We next examined the effect of functional ablation
of VCP/p97 segregase complex. The target specific siRNA
but not the control siRNA depleted the corresponding VCP/
p97, UFD1 and UBXD7 proteins (Figure 2B). As a result,
the depletion of these components prevented UVR-induced
RNAPII loss. Notably, UVR-induced RNAPII loss required
VCP/p97 and the same UBXD7 adaptor for UVR-induced
CSB degradation, which was also prevented by VCP/p97
inhibition [26]. Thus, the loss of CSB could not be the
reason for the failure of RNAPII degradation. Given that the
role of proteasome in RNAPII degradation, we concluded

that VCP/p97 and UBXD7 adaptor are functionally required
for ubiquitin-mediated RNAPII degradation.

VCP/p97 segregase extracts RNAPII from
chromatin
RNAPII is known to stall at DNA lesions scattered
along chromatin. Therefore, we isolated cytoplasmic and
chromatin fractions of CS1AN+iCSB cells to determine
the existence of RNAPII in corresponding cellular protein
fractions. As shown in Figure 3A, RNAPII was mainly
present in chromatin fraction where it exhibited a gradual
decrease following cellular UVR exposure. The slowmigrating modified RNAPII forms appeared in chromatin
fraction upon UV irradiation. In comparison, only a small
fraction of VCP/p97 was detectable in chromatin while
the majority resided in cytoplasm. Correspondingly,
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was detected in
cytoplasm and to a lesser extent in chromatin. Whereas,

antibody. “S. Exp.” indicates a shorter exposure and “L. Exp.” indicates a longer exposure in protein detection. Lamin B blot serves as a

DNA origin recognition complex 2 subunit (ORC2), a
known chromatin-associated protein, resided exclusively
in chromatin.
When the degradation of chromatin-associated
RNAPII was examined, the results showed that as
compared with DBeQ-untreated controls, the VCP/p97
inhibition apparently prevented the UVR-induced RNAPII
loss from chromatin at 4 and 6 h post-UVR (Figure 3B).
We then determined the distribution of RNAPII in
nucleoplasmic, soluble (nuclease-releasable) and insoluble
chromatin fractions following 2 h of UVR under the
conditions of VCP/p97 inhibition (Figure 3C). RNAPII was
seen in soluble chromatin and to a higher extent in insoluble
chromatin, indicating the tight association of RNAPII with
chromatin. Although UV irradiation immobilized RNAPII
to soluble chromatin fractions, the VCP/p97 inhibition and
UV irradiation together further immobilized RNAPII into

insoluble chromatin fraction, where the modified RNAPII
forms were exclusively detected. The modified RNAPII
forms were slightly elevated by UVR and DBeQ pretreatments. The examination of proteasomal Sug1 and S1
proteins indicated that while VCP/p97 inhibition restored
the UVR-depleted Sug1 in soluble chromatin, DBeQ
immobilized both Sug1 and S1 in insoluble chromatin.
Predictably, only a small fraction of VCP/p97 resides in
soluble chromatin, and the presence was slightly enhanced
by UVR and DBeQ treatment. Meanwhile, VCP/p97
inhibition restored the UVR-depleted UBXD7 adaptor
in soluble chromatin. The accumulation of Sug1, S1 and
UBXD7 in soluble or insoluble chromatin is presumably
attracted by the unprocessed ubiquitin conjugates due to
VCP/p97 inhibition. As a control, DDB2, a known VCP/
p97 substrate [24], was seen to reside primarily in soluble
chromatin, get depleted upon UVR exposure and, as

of VCP/p97 impairs UV-induced RNAPII degradation in corrected CSB-deficient cells. The CS1AN+iCSB cells were induced for CSB
expression in presence of 1 µg/ml doxycycline (Dox) for 24 h. The cells were UV irradiated, treated with DBeQ and maintained under
Dox withdrawal (Wdrl) for indicated post-UVR time periods. The RNAPII, CSB, and VCP/p97 in cell lysates were detected by Western
blotting with specific antibodies. Lamin B blot serves as a loading control. (B) HCT116 cells were transfected with the control (Ctrl) or

expected, get restored by VCP/p97 inhibition. Collectively,
these results indicated that VCP/p97 functions in extracting
ubiquitinated lesion-stalled RNAPII, which is tightly
associated with chromatin.

Moreover, the slow-migrating modified RNAPII showed
a clear presence in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates from
UV irradiated cells, indicating that VCP/p97 binds to both
RNAPII and ubiquitinated RNAPII. The RNAPII-VCP/p97
interaction was further confirmed by similar experiments
using another U2OS cell line, which harbors an inducible
Myc-tagged EQ-VCP/p97 (Figure 4B). We persistently
observed that ubiquitinated species in the EQ-VCP/p97bound RNAPII were relatively less discernible. This
could be explained by potential dominant negative effect
of EQ-VCP/p97, which causes tight binding of ubiquitinconjugated RNAPII species to chromatin and rendering it
hard to extract in RIPA buffer. Nevertheless, the binding of
VCP/p97 to RNAPII was authenticated by using RNAPII
antibody for reciprocal immunoprecipitation (Figure 4C).
Here, VCP/p97 was clearly detected by anti-RNAPII
immunoprecipitation but not in corresponding controls.
We extended the immunoprecipitation analysis
to CS1AN+iCSB cells with and without CSB induction
(Figure 4D). Both RNAPII and CSB were present in the
samples of immunoprecipitation with VCP/p97 antibody.

RNAPII interacts with VCP/p97
We next carried out immunoprecipitation
experiments to determine the interaction between RNAPII
and VCP/p97. For this, we used genetically engineered
U2OS cells harboring an inducible Myc-tagged wildtype (Wt) or mutant (Mut)-VCP/p97. The U2OS cells
were transfected with expression construct for HA-tagged
ubiquitin (HA-Ub) for 48 h with Dox added for the second
24-h period to enable Myc-tagged VCP/p97 expression.
HA-ubiquitin expression allowed the examination of
cellular ubiquitination. Our previous experiments have
demonstrated the binding of VCP/p97 to ubiquitin
conjugates, and ubiquitinated and native CSB protein [26].
As shown in Figure 4A, RNAPII was detected in antiMyc immunoprecipitates from VCP/p97 induced cells.

Dox-induced, UV irradiated, maintained for indicated time periods, and then subjected to cellular protein fractionation protocol. RNAPII,

Actin, Lamin B and nuclear protein ORC2 served as fractionation mark or as loading controls. “L. Exp.” indicates longer exposure.

DBeQ or vehicle for 4 h, UV-irradiated at 50 J/m2 and kept under DBeQ treatment for additional 2 h. Nucleoplasmic, soluble chromatin
and insoluble chromatin fractions were isolated by cellular protein fractionation. The RNAPII, 19S proteasomal Sug1 and S1, as well as
UBXD7 were examined in indicated chromatin fractions containing the same amount of proteins. Lamin B served as a fractionation mark
and a loading control.

Remarkably, CSB expression increased the abundance of
RNAPII associated with VCP/p97. Of note, our previous
results have shown the association of VCP/p97 with the
UFD1 and NPL4 [26]. Thus, CSB promotes or enhances the
association of VCP/p97 segregase complex with RNAPII.

from RNAPII ubiquitination, which was previously
shown to be somewhat dependent on functional CSA
and CSB, the latter accelerates RNAPII ubiquitination
during early post-UVR times [32]. Therefore, we further
determined the effect of CSB on RNAPII ubiquitination.
The CS1AN+iCSB cells were transfected with expression
constructs for HA-Ub for 48 h and during the second
24-h period, Dox was added for CSB induction. In
Figure 5A, ubiquitinated RNAPII species with low molecular
masses showed a clear presence in UV-irradiated cells. More

importantly, both MG132 and DBeQ significantly augmented
the presence of ubiquitin-modified RNAPII species and
increased the molecular mass higher, indicating that UVRinduced RNAPII ubiquitination and the accumulation of
ubiquitin conjugates through the inhibitory actions on
proteasome or VCP/p97.
In the absence of CSB, RNAPII-ubiquitin conjugates
also exhibited an appearance (Figure 5B). A side-by-side

comparison of RNAPII-ubiquitin conjugates, however,
indicated that the RNAPII ubiquitination was much more
apparent in the presence than that in the absence of CSB.
This was true both with and without proteasome or VCP/
p97 inhibition, arguing that these inhibitors only allow
accumulation of RNAPII-ubiquitin conjugates but do not
change the RNAPII ubiquitination status affected by CSB
(Figure 5C). In addition, increased levels of VCP/p97

were detected in anti-RNAPII precipitates in the presence
of CSB, further supporting the enhanced interaction of
VCP/p97 with RNAPII by CSB. Taken together, these
experiments indicated that RNAPII ubiquitination is
enhanced by CSB, albeit CSB is not essential for RNAPII
ubiquitination.

at 4 to 6 h, which was prevented by VCP/p97 inhibition
(Figure 7A). In pVHL-proficient UOK121-VHL cells,
the level of RNAPII (Pol IIo form) was relatively higher
before and 2 h after UVR treatment. Yet, a more profound
UVR-induced RNAPII loss occurred. The RNAPII loss
was partially rescued by VCP/p97 inhibition. Thus, both
pVHL-dependent and -independent RNAPII degradation
requires VCP/p97 function.
Since Elongin ubiquitin ligase complex contains
Cullin (Cul2 or Cul5), and the activity of Cullin-based
ubiquitin ligases is regulated by neddylation, a process that
modifies Cullin with small ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 [40].
We asked whether neddylation is required for UVRinduced RNAPII degradation in the absence of CSB. The
24-h pretreatment with neddylation inhibitor MLN2924
effectively blocked Cul4A neddylation as judged by the
disappearance of Nedd8 conjugates and the accumulation
of native Cul4 (Figure 7B). The neddylation inhibition
increased RNAPII levels without UV irradiation, and
effectively prevented UVR-induced RNAPII from
degradation. Notably, this happened in the absence of CSB,
further confirming the UVR-induced RNAPII degradation
can take place without TC-NER attempts. To conclude,
neddylation of Cullins is required for efficient UVRinduced RNAPII degradation.
Next, we investigated cell viability of pVHLdeficient UOK121 and pVHL-proficient UOK121-VHL
cells in response to UVR and VCP/p97 inhibition. The
UOK121-VHL cells were more resistant to UVR-induced
cell killing than UOK121 cells (Figure 7C). We noticed
that this UVR response was opposite of the effect caused
by antitumor compound Et743 [39]. Importantly, the
VCP/p97 inhibition by DBeQ exhibited obvious toxicity
without UVR and significantly increased UVR toxicity in
UOK121-VHL cells at doses as low as 10 J/m2, indicating
a pVHL-dependent UVR toxicity at low UV dose under
VCP/p97 inhibition. We concluded that VCP/p97 plays a
role in cell survival after UVR exposure.

RNAPII turnover is delayed by CSB
Although CSA and CSB proteins promote the rapid
RNAPII ubiquitination upon UV irradiation [32], the rate
of UVR-induced RNAPII turnover is not significantly
affected by the functional status of CSA and CSB [38].
To understand this conundrum, we again utilized
CS1AN+iCSB cells because the inducible CSB expression
allows a comparison of UVR-induced RNAPII turnover
within identical cellular backgrounds (Figure 6A). In the
absence of CSB, the RNAPII was detectable at a lesser
extent without UVR, due presumably to the altered
RNAPII phosphorylation [38]. UVR-induced RNAPII
degradation occurred regardless of CSB. However,
comparison of the kinetics of UVR-induced RNAPII
turnover clearly showed a delay of RNAPII turnover in the
presence of CSB (Figure 6A and 6B). The UVR-induced
RNAPII turnover occurred from 4 to 6 h period in the
absence of CSB (Figure 6B). By contrast, in the presence
of CSB, a clear RNAPII turnover is seen to begin from
6 to 8 h and with greater residual RNAPII. Moreover,
UVR-induced CSB turnover steadily occurred following
UVR up to 8 h (Figure 6C). The RNAPII and CSB turnover
overlapped around the 4 to 8 h period. Taken together, we
concluded that CSB slows down UVR-induced RNAPII
turnover.
We further tested if UVR-induced RNAPII turnover
without CSB requires the function of VCP/p97. Indeed,
both MG132 and DBeQ prevented UVR-induced RNAPII
turnover in the absence of CSB (Figure 6D). Thus, UVRinduced RNAPII turnover is mediated by VCP/p97
regardless of CSB, which increases RNAPII ubiquitination
but delays RNAPII turnover.

DISCUSSION

VCP/p97 inhibition impairs both pVHL-dependent
and -independent RNAPII degradation and affects
cell viability following UV irradiation

This study provides evidence that in mammalian
cells, VCP/p97 segregase complex functions in UVRinduced RNAPII degradation via extraction of tight
chromatin-bound ubiquitinated RNAPII. The UVRinduced RNAPII degradation always requires VCP/
p97 function, but can occur regardless of CSB function.
Remarkably, we found that CSB enhances the RNAPII
ubiquitination and the association between VCP/p97
and RNAPII, but slows down UVR-induced RNAPII
degradation. These findings can be reconciled through the
proposed model in which CSB plays a role in coordinating
the extraction or co-extraction of ubiquitinated RNAPII
and CSB itself by VCP/p97 (Figure 8). Lastly, we
showed that VCP/p97 mediates UVR-induced RNAPII
degradation that occurs with and without pVHL, a

Elongin ubiquitin ligase complex is one of the
E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in UVR-induced RNAPII
degradation [8, 9]. The Elongin ubiquitin ligase complex
contains Cul2/Cul5, Rbx1/Rbx2 and pVHL. The latter
acts as a substrate receptor for RNAPII [9–11]. The
involvement of pVHL in TC-NER was suggested by the
examination of TCR-NER dependent toxicity of antitumor
compound Et743 [39]. Therefore, we tested if VCP/p97
is required for UVR-induced RNAPII degradation in the
context of cellular pVHL background. In pVHL-deficient
UOK121 cells, UVR induced a discernible loss of RNAPII

substrate receptor of Elongin E3 ubiquitin ligase for
RNAPII ubiquitination. We inferred that the coordinated
co-extraction of ubiquitinated RNAPII and CSB by VCP/
p97 segregase presents an essential step of TC-NER.
RNAPII that undergoes ubiquitin-mediated
degradations has two important features: the elongating
and the irreversible stalling [41]. However, what makes
the stalling of an elongating RNAPII irreversible is poorly
understood. If degradation is an endpoint of the irreversibly
stalled RNAPII, its ubiquitination in essence would be
the signature of the irreversible stalling. The proteasomal
degradation requires that the substrates carry at least 4
lysine 48-linked ubiquitin moieties in vitro [42]. The role
of ubiquitin chain length in limiting the amount of time
of functional action before proteolysis was first described
by the study of steroid receptor coactivator-3 [43]. In
our study, photolesion-stalled RNAPII is ubiquitinated
more in the presence than in the absence of CSB. Yet, the
UVR-induced RNAPII turnover is faster in the absence
of CSB. This phenomenon is intriguing, because “the
role of ubiquitin chain length” does not appear to apply
to irreversibly stalled RNAPII. In earlier investigations,

the effects of CS deficiency on UVR-induced RNAPII
ubiquitination were intensively investigated [7, 32, 35].
Although the experiments were conducted in different
cell lines and in different time frames following UVR,
RNAPII ubiquitination was found somewhat compromised
but not fully defective in CS cells. On the other hand, a
consensus on UVR-induced RNAPII turnover requiring
CSA and CSB function is still lacking [7, 38, 44]. Our
comparison of UVR-induced RNAPII ubiquitination
and turnover was conducted in established isogenic cell
lines with inducible CSB transgene and, therefore, only
introduces a single variable factor that could affect the
RNAPII ubiquitination and turnover. In our study, CSB
enhances RNAPII ubiquitination but slows down UVRinduced RNAPII turnover. Such a protective function
of CSB on UVR-induced turnover is analogous to, as
well as consistent with, the function of Rad26, a yeast
homolog of CSA and CSB [45]. In yeast, Rad26 appears to
antagonize Def1 in ubiquitin-mediated Rpb1 degradation.
We envisage that RNAPII ubiquitination, although
independent of CSB function, occurs more efficiently on
stabilized RNAPII-CSB complex that is known to attract

other needed proteins, e.g., CSA-containing E3 ubiquitin
ligase, other core NER factors and non-NER factors [31].
As more proteins disembark onto the RNAPII-CSB
complex, the stalling of RNAPII becomes progressively

irreversible, and more ubiquitin moieties are added to
RNAPII. Ultimately, the ubiquitinated RNAPII and CSB
is coordinately extracted or co-extracted by VCP/p97 from
chromatin for proteolysis, and for the commencement of

cellular TC-NER events (Figure 8). Here, the depiction of
events like ubiquitination, VCP-mediated extraction, and
core NER factor recruitment is somewhat oversimplified
as the participation of non-NER factors in expected to
be dynamic in nature. Hence, the model only provides
a tentative understanding but not the actual formation
of large functioning complexes. In the case of CSB
deficiency, RNAPII ubiquitination can still exceed the
minimal degradable ubiquitin length and the ubiquitinated
RNAPII will be quickly extracted from chromatin and
undergo proteolysis. Thus, the ability of CSB to transiently
stabilize RNAPII not only creates a time window but
also provides protein elements for transitioning from
transcription elongation to TC-NER.

The function of CSB to enhance RNAPII
ubiquitination and transiently prevent RNAPII
turnover appears to be in agreement with its ability to
stabilize the RNAPII-CSB interaction at DNA lesions
[29, 30]. The CSB’s yeast homologue, Rad26, has
a well-documented role in transcription elongation
[46–48]. However, it remains unclear whether
enhancement of RNAPII ubiquitination by CSB is related
to its chromatin remodeling activity [49] and/or chromatin
regulation activity [47, 50], which regulate transcription
elongation. It has been shown that Rad26 is recruited to
the site of DNA lesion in an elongating RNA polymerase
II-dependent manner in vivo [48], and is required for
removal of RNAPII from UVR-damaged chromatin [51].

Figure 8: Hypothetical model depicting the role of VCP/p97 in UVR-induced RNAPII proteolysis and TC-NER. When
elongating RNAPII encounters a transcription-blocking DNA lesion, it arrests at the lesion sites. In the absence of CSB, the arrested
RNAPII recruits E3 ubiquitin ligase(s), e.g. VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and is ubiquitinated. The ubiquitinated RNAPII attracts
VCP/p97 segregase complex, which in turn extracts ubiquitinated RNAPII from chromatin and presents it to proteasome for degradation
in a fast-paced manner. When CSB is present, transiently stabilized CSB-RNAPII complex recruits CRL4CSA, an E3 ubiquitin ligase for
CSB, and VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, a potentially TC-NER relevant E3 for RNAPII to ubiquitinate CSB and RNAPII, respectively.
Subsequently, VCP/p97 segregase complex co-extracts ubiquitinated CSB and RNAPII from the lesion sites, which in turn facilities the
sequential incorporation of arriving core NER factors into pre-incision complex. The ubiquitinated RNAPII is eventually presented to
proteasome by VCP/p97 for degradation while the ubiquitinated CSB is rescued by deubiquitination.

It is possible that CSB can use its remodeling activity to
displace a reversibly stalled RNAPII but not an irreversibly
stalled RNAPII, which is ubiquitinated by E3(s). It is
also possible that CSB ubiquitination compromises its
remodeling activity, such that both ubiquitinated CSB and
RNAPII have to be extracted from damaged chromatin by
VCP/p97.
It has been proposed that yeast cells degrade
irreversibly stalled RNAPII as a last resort for cell
survival, when a transcription block, e.g., a DNA lesion,
cannot be repaired or bypassed [45]. In our previous study,
cellular toxicity of UVR under VCP/p97 inhibition was
further exacerbated with CSB than without CSB [26].
Considering that both RNAPII and CSB are substrates
of VCP/p97, it is conceivable that the clearance of
ubiquitinated RNAPII from chromatin by VCP/p97 offers
a better chance for cell survival both with and without TCNER attempts. In this study, we were particularly intrigued
by the findings from the investigation of VCP/p97 function
in the context of pVHL-containing Elongin E3 ligase
(Figure 7). The pVHL re-expression accelerates UVRinduced VCP/p97-mediated RNAPII turnover, confirming
that pVHL-containing Elongin E3 ligase is at least partially
responsible for RNAPII turnover. This notion is further
supported by the finding that neddylation [of Cullin(s)] is
required for UVR-induced RNAPII turnover. Interestingly,
such a requirement of Cullin neddylation was seen in the
absence of CSB, suggesting that Elongin E3 ligase can
work to degrade RNAPII even without TC-NER attempts.
By examining the effect of pVHL re-expression and VCP/
p97 inhibition on cell viability, we revealed a potential
link between TC-NER and pVHL-VCP/p97-mediated
RNAPII turnover. First, pVHL re-expression confers
greater UVR resistance as compared to pVHL deficiency.
Importantly, such a survival advantage was not observable
with antitumor compound Et743 [39]. Instead, pVHL reexpression contributes to the toxicity of Et743. It is known
that Et743 toxicity requires functional TC-NER and arises
from the trapping of TC-NER machinery to Et743-DNA
adducts due to abortive TC-NER attempts [52]. Given that
pVHL re-expression re-establishes TC-NER proficiency
which contributes to Et743 toxicity [39], it is conceivable
that TC-NER of photolesions contributes resistance of
pVHL-proficient UOK121 cells to UVR. Second, VCP/
p97 inhibition decreases cell viability regardless of pVHL
but more importantly, VCP/p97 inhibition increased UV
killing at low dose (10 J/m2) in pVHL re-expressed cells,
signifying that VCP/p97 inhibition abolishes TC-NER
proficiency conferred by pVHL re-expression. Thus, these
findings suggest that VCP/p97-mediated extraction of
RNAPII may be an integral part of TC-NER. However, the
exact role of VCP/p97 in TC-NER warrants more vigorous
testing in future studies.
In summary, we have described the function of
VCP/p97 segregase and CSB in proteolytic clearance
of RNAPII from damaged chromatin. The findings will
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

allow further in-depth investigations of TC-NER, e.g.,
identification of E3 ubiquitin ligase(s) relevant to RNAPII
ubiquitination in TC-NER. The findings also have clinical
implications in targeting VCP/p97 for cancer therapy.
Notably, VCP/p97 silencing has shown pronounced
synergistic interactions with DNA-damaging agents [53].
Thus, VCP/p97 inhibitors may be more effectively used in
combination with proteasome inhibitors and transcriptionblocking DNA-damaging cancer therapeutics in future
translational studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, chemicals and antibodies
HCT116 and HCT116-USP7–/– cells were obtained
from Vogelstein laboratory [54]. U2OS cell lines, stably
transfected with tetracycline-inducible DNA constructs
expressing Myc-tagged Wt or Mut EQ (E578Q)-VCP/p97,
were provided by Weihl laboratory [55]. The dominantnegative EQ mutant is deficient in ATP-hydrolysis activity
of VCP/p97. The CS1AN+iCSB cell line, a derivative of
CSB-defective CS1AN cells, was a gift from Dr. Zhou,
Yonggang [56]. CS1AN+iCSB cells express CSB under
the control of the tetracycline-responsive promoter. The
UOK121 (pVHL-deficient cell) and UOK121-VHL
(also called UOK121wt cells) were from Dr. W. Marston
Linehan laboratory. UOK121 has a hyper-methylated
copy and a silent copy of VHL, and thus lacks pVHL
expression; UOK121-VHL cell line has a restored pVHL
expression from a stably transfected VHL cDNA [57, 58].
VCP/p97 inhibitor DBeQ, N2,N4-Dibenzylquinazoline2,4-diamine, was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO 63103). Proteasome inhibitor MG132 was obtained

was done with anti- RNAPII or anti-VCP/p97 or control
antibodies at 4°C overnight. The immuno-complexes
were captured by protein A Plus G agarose beads.
The inducible Myc-tagged Wt or EQ-VCP/p97 from
cell lysates in RIPA buffer was immunoprecipitated
with anti-Myc affinity gels. The proteins or ubiquitin
conjugates recovered by immunoprecipitation were
analyzed by Western blotting.

Cell culture, DNA and siRNA transfection
CS1AN cell lines, U2OS, UOK121, HeLa cells and
their derivatives were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle
medium (DMEM); HCT116 and HCT116-USP7−/− cells
were grown in McCoy’s 5A. All cells are grown in medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
1% penicillin and streptomycin at 37oC in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2. Antibiotics Hygromycin B and
Zeocin were used for maintaining stably transfected
CS1AN cell lines and U2OS cell lines as required.
DNA constructs were transfected into U2OS, HeLa
or CS1AN cells using Fugene 6 transfection reagents
(Promega Corporation, Madison, WI 53711), while the
siRNA transfection was performed using Lipofectamine
2000 reagents (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY
14072). All DNA and siRNA transfection experiments
were conducted according to the manufacturer’s protocols.

Cell viability assay
The MTT [3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide] assay was used to
determine cell viability. UOK121 and UOK121-VHL
cells were seeded in 96-well plates at proper density
(7,000 cells per well) in day 1 and incubated for 24 h.
In day 2, the cells were UV irradiated at variable doses
from 10 to 50 J/m2, immediately treated with 5 μM
DBeQ or vehicle, and cell cultures continued for 48 h.
The cells were supplied with 100 μl fresh medium,
and 10 μl of MTT stock reagent (5 mg/ml) were added
directly to 96-well plates and incubated for another
4 h. Subsequently, the culture medium including MTT
was carefully removed, and the cells were washed once
with PBS. After removal of PBS, 200 μl of DMSO were
added to each well, and the plate was gently shaken for
dissolving the formazan crystals. The absorbance was
read at 540 nm. The relative cell viability was calculated
from the ratios of absorbance of treated to untreated
cells, each from an average of 6–8 replicates.

Cellular protein fractionation
Cellular fractionation was carried out as described
by Anindya et al. [7], with some modifications. The cells
were lysed in ~5× cell volume of cytoplasmic lysis buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.9], 0.34 M sucrose, 3 mM CaCl2,
2 mM Mg(OAc)2, 1 mM DDT, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40
and a protease inhibitor cocktail). Nuclei were pelleted
by centrifugation at 3, 500 g for 15 min and washed with
wash buffer (cytoplasmic lysis buffer without NP-40)
and then lysed in ~5× cell volume of nuclear lysis buffer
(20 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 10% glycerol, 3 mM EDTA,
150 mM KOAc, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and protease inhibitors).
The cellular nucleoplasmic fractions were separated by
centrifugation at 15, 000 g for 30 min and the pellets were
designated as chromatin fraction. For further processing,
the pellets were re-suspended in ~1× cell volume of
nuclease incubation buffer (150 mM HEPES [pH 7.9],
150 mM KOAc, 1.5 mM MgCl2 and protease inhibitors)
and incubated with 50 U Benzonase for 30 min at room
temperature. The nuclease-releasable/soluble chromatin
fraction was collected by centrifugation at 20, 000 g for
30 min. The pellets were designated as insoluble chromatin
fraction, and were dissolved by boiling in SDS sample buffer.

Quantitative analysis and statistics
Quantitative analysis was done on digitalized
Western blotting images by ImageJ software and the
relative protein amounts were calculated based on
gray density. The Student’s t-test was performed using
SigmaPlot software.
