BACKGROUND. The tolerability and efficacy of the combination of tipifarnib, an
orally bioavailable nonpeptidomimetic farnesyl transferase inhibitor, and imatinib was investigated in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic
phase who had failed imatinib.
METHODS. Twenty-six patients (13 [50%] with Abl kinase domain mutations) were
treated. The initial dose level was tipifarnib at a dose of 300 mg twice daily and
imatinib at a dose of 300 mg daily. Therapy was escalated following a ‘3 1 3’
phase 1 design and the maximum tolerated dose was defined as tipifarnib at a
dose of 400 mg twice daily and imatinib at a dose of 400 mg daily. Therapy was
administered for a median of 26 weeks (range, 3–150 weeks).

RESULTS. Adverse events included diarrhea in 21 patients (81%) and nausea in 18

patients (69%), but were generally grade 2 or less (using the revised National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria). Grade 3–4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 11 patients (42%) and 8 patients (31%), respectively.
Sixteen patients discontinued therapy (5 due to toxicity and 11 due to lack of
response or disease progression). Hematologic responses were attained by 17
(68%) of 25 assessable patients. Nine patients (36%) also achieved a cytogenetic
response (3 complete responses, 4 partial responses, and 2 minimal responses),
including 4 patients harboring mutant Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinases. One patient bearing the highly imatinib-resistant T315I mutant achieved a partial cytogenetic
response. The median response duration was 3 months (range, 2–30+ months).

CONCLUSIONS. The combination of tipifarnib and imatinib is well tolerated and
has activity against several Abl kinase domain mutants. Combinations of tipifarnib with more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors warrant further investigation.

matinib mesylate induces complete hematologic (CHR) and major
cytogenetic response (MCyR) in greater than 95% and 85%,
respectively, of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
in chronic phase (CP).1 However, imatinib fails to eradicate quiescent BCR-ABL-positive stem cells2–4 and a subset of patients develop
imatinib resistance, which has been associated in 30% to 50% of
cases with point mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL.2,5–8
One strategy to overcome imatinib resistance is to interfere with
Bcr-Abl downstream pathways such as the Ras pathways. Localization to the inner plasma membrane is critical in Ras activation9 and
is accomplished through a posttranslational prenylation process by
which a 15-carbon isoprenyl (farnesyl) moiety is attached to the
C-terminal cysteine residue by the enzyme farnesyltransferase (Ftase)

and to a lesser extent by geranylgeranyl-protein
transferases (GGPTases).10 Ftase inhibitors (FTIs)
were developed as a means of inhibiting Ras activation, although their antineoplastic effects have been
proved to be mediated through inhibition of farnesylation of other proteins such as RhoB,10,11 Rab,12
and CENP-E and -F.13
FTIs have antiproliferative activity against BCRABL-positive cell lines and cells from patients,
including some resistant to imatinib.14 Tipifarnib is a
nonpeptidomimetic FTI that has modest single-agent
efficacy in the treatment of patients with CML in all
phases after imatinib failure.15,16 In vitro, FTIs have
proven synergistic with imatinib both in imatinibsensitive and imatinib-insensitive cell lines.17–19
Hence, it is conceivable that a combination of these
agents acting through a different mechanism of
action could overcome and potentially prevent the
development of imatinib resistance and improve
clinical outcomes.
In this phase 1 study, we investigated the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the toxicity profile
of the combination of tipifarnib and imatinib in
patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive
CML in CP who had previously failed therapy with
imatinib. The results suggest that this combination is
safe and active in this patient population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Patients with BCR-ABL-positive CML in CP who had
failed therapy with at least the standard dose imatinib (ie, 400 mg daily) were eligible. Imatinib failure
was defined as: 1) inability to achieve or loss of CHR
after 3 months of imatinib, 2) failure to achieve or
loss of at least a minimal cytogenetic response after
6 months of imatinib, or 3) failure to achieve or loss
of a MCyR after 12 months of imatinib. Other eligibility criteria were: 1) performance status 2 by the
Zubrod scale; 2) serum creatinine and total bilirubin
level <2 mg/dL; 3) a white blood cell count (WBC)
<30 3 109/L (hydroxyurea had to be discontinued 24
hours prior study entry); and 4) the practice of effective methods of contraception by women of
childbearing potential. All patients provided informed consent approved by the Institutional Review
Board.
Treatment Schedule
Patients received tipifarnib initially at a dose of
300 mg orally twice daily for 14 days every 21 days
(ie, 14 days on/7 days off) and imatinib at a dose of
300 mg orally daily. Dose escalation to the dose

levels shown in Table 1 were performed according to
a ‘3 1 3’ phase 1 design. Patients were observed for
at least 3 weeks before the next cohort was treated at
the next dose level. Tipifarnib and imatinib doses
could be decreased to dose level –1 and –2 whenever
unacceptable toxicity occurred. Development of an
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1.0 3 109/L or
platelet count <50 3 109/L led to therapy interruption until counts recovered above these levels. Therapy was then resumed at the same dose level if
recovery occurred within 2 weeks or at a lower dose
level if it occurred after 2 weeks. Patients who experienced grade 2 neurotoxicity for more than 48 hours
had therapy withheld until resolution to grade 1,
and then resumed at the same dose level. If neurotoxicity recurred, therapy was stopped until recovery
to grade 1 and then resumed at the next lower dose
level. Patients who experienced other grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity had therapy stopped until
resolution to grade 1 and then resumed at the
next lower dose level. Individual tipifarnib or imatinib dose adjustments were allowed if the toxicity
was clearly related to 1 of the drugs. Intrapatient
dose escalation was allowed for patients achieving an
inadequate response.
Toxicities were evaluated using the revised
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(version 2.0). The MTD and dose-limiting toxicity
(DLT) were defined within the first 2 cycles of therapy. DLT was defined as grade 3 nonhematologic
toxicity. Nausea and vomiting were considered a DLT
only if not responsive to antiemetic therapy. Hematologic DLT was defined as ANC <1 3 109/L or platelet
count <50 3 109/L lasting for 6 weeks after interruption of therapy with a hypocellular bone marrow
in the absence of bone marrow blasts. Anemia was
not considered a hematologic DLT.

Patient Evaluation
Baseline studies included a complete physical examination, complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive

biochemistry panel (including liver function tests),
bone marrow aspirate with cytogenetics, and an
electrocardiogram. A CBC with differential was obtained weekly for the first 3 weeks and then every
3 weeks. Blood chemistries were repeated weekly
during the first 3 weeks and every 6 to 8 weeks thereafter. Bone marrow aspirate and cytogenetics (fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH], when cytogenetics
were unevaluable) were performed at the end of
Cycle 3, every 3 months to 4 months for 1 year, and
then every 12 months while the patient received
therapy.
Response criteria were as previously described.20
CHR was defined as a WBC count <10 3 109/L, a
platelet count <450 3 109/L, no immature cells
(blasts, promyelocytes, or myelocytes) in the peripheral blood, and the disappearance of all signs and
symptoms related to leukemia for at least 4 weeks. A
CHR was further categorized by the best cytogenetic
response as complete (0% Ph-positive), partial (1–
35% Ph-positive), minor (36–65% Ph-positive), and
minimal (66–95% Ph-positive). A major cytogenetic
response (MCyR) included complete (CCyR) plus partial (PCyR) cytogenetic responses. The criteria for partial hematologic remission (PHR) were similar to
those of CHR except for the persistence of a few
immature cells in the peripheral blood and/or persistent splenomegaly or thrombocytosis (>450 3 109/L)
but at least 50% less than pretreatment.

Study Design
A minimum of 3 patients were entered at each dose
level. If no DLT was observed in 3 patients treated at
a given dose level after the last patient treated had
been observed for a minimum of 3 weeks, dose escalation was indicated in the next cohort of patients. If
DLT occurred in 1 of 3 patients, 3 more patients were
entered at the same dose level. If grade 3–4 toxicity
developed in 2 of 3 or 6 patients, this dose was considered to exceed the MTD. The MTD was thus
defined as the dose resulting in DLT in 1 or fewer of
6 patients. Once the MTD was defined, additional
patients were treated at this dose to define the toxicity profile more precisely.
Criteria for withdrawing a patient from the study
were: 1) continuous increase in WBC counts (WBC
>40 3 109/L or 50% increase in WBC count for
patients beginning with WBC >40 3 109/L) despite
repeated cycles, 2) the development of features of
accelerated ([AP]; except clonal evolution) or blastic
phase (BP) while on study, 3) unacceptable grade 3
to 4 toxicity in the absence of significant antileukemic effect, and 4) at the patient’s request.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between October 2002 and May 2005, 26 patients (12
males) with Ph-positive CML in CP who had failed
single-agent imatinib therapy were treated (Table 2).
Other prior therapies included interferon (IFN)-a in
23 patients (88%) (14 of whom received it in combination with cytarabine [10 patients], homoharringtonine [2 patients], imatinib [1 patient], or
granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor [1
patient]), decitabine (3 patients), homoharringtonine (3
patients), and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (3
patients), 1 of whom received transplantation in 3
different occasions and 2 of whom received donor
lymphocyte infusions. The best responses obtained
with single-agent imatinib were a CHR in 10 patients,
CCyR in 1 patient, PCyR in 11 patients, and minor
cytogenetic response in 1 patient. Three patients
were found to be primary refractory to imatinib. At
the initiation of tipifarnib and imatinib therapy, only
11 patients (42%) were in CHR. Of the 15 patients
(58%) who were not in CHR, 4 were receiving hydroxyurea and 6 were receiving anagrelide to control
their peripheral blood counts. One patient had a variant Ph chromosome and 1 other had clonal evolution (double Ph chromosome). A baseline BCR-ABL/
ABL ratio was obtained in 25 patients (96%; 1 suboptimal specimen) and ABL gene sequencing was performed in 25 patients (96%), revealing the presence
of mutations in 13 (52%) (M244V and E355G in 3

Toxicity
Analysis of safety was based on data from all 26
enrolled patients (Table 3). The most frequent nonhematologic toxicities were gastrointestinal, fatigue,
and skin rash, but these were manageable with
symptomatic treatment, and therefore were not considered to constitute a DLT. Nine patients had central
nervous system (CNS) toxicity, including 1 who had a
grade 3 traumatic subdural hematoma and 1 with
grade 3 cerebellar toxicity secondary to benign paroxysmal positional vertigo at dose level 2, but both
toxicities were unrelated to the study treatment. Anemia occurred in 17 patients (65%) (grade 3–4 in 5
patients). Twenty episodes of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia were reported during the administration of a
total of 299 cycles, for an overall incidence of 7%.
Four patients were hospitalized due to grade 3 neutropenic fever. Grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia was
reported in 8 patients (31%), although bleeding was
only reported in 1 patient (grade 2 lower gastrointestinal bleeding). Adverse events led to dose level
reduction in 10 patients (38%), 3 of whom required
more than 2 dose level reductions. Patients were
required to interrupt therapy for a median of 33 days
(range, 0 to 99 days), mostly due to hematologic toxicity. Adverse events led to termination of the study
treatment in 5 patients (19%). One patient with risk
factors for coronary artery disease died of myocardial
infarction after 14 days on the study at dose level 2.
No DLT was identified with the first 2 dose levels.
One patient developed grade 3 diarrhea at dose level

2. Three more patients were entered at this dose level
without evidence of DLT. Two of 3 patients treated at
dose level 3 experienced DLTs (1 with grade 3 fatigue
and 1 with grade 3 esophagitis). Accordingly, tipifarnib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily and imatinib at a
dose of 400 mg daily (dose level 2) was considered
the MTD. Eleven additional patients were treated at
this dose level. Of these, 2 patients had grade 3 neutropenia and 1 had grade 3 dehydration/renal insufficiency and fatigue. A median of 8 cycles (range, 1–49
cycles) were administered, with a median of 12 cycles
(range, 7–13 cycles) at dose level 0, 12 cycles (range,
4–16 cycles) at dose level 1, 5 cycles (range, 1–49
cycles) at dose level 2, and 8 cycles (range, 3–15
cycles) at dose level 3.

Efficacy
The median duration of therapy was 26 weeks
(range, 3–150 weeks). All but 1 patient, who died
before completion of the first cycle of therapy, were
assessable for efficacy analysis (Table 4). CHR was
maintained or achieved by 17 of 25 (68%) patients
while receiving the study treatment. Hematologic
responses lasting at least 4 weeks occurred in 10
(62%) of 16 patients not in CHR at study entry,
including 8 patients (50%) who achieved a CHR (4
ongoing) that was sustained for a median of 11
weeks (range, 7–381 weeks) and 2 patients (12%)
who attained a PHR. Nine patients (36%) achieved a
cytogenetic response. No cytogenetic responses were
observed among the first 6 patients (3 with ABL
mutations) treated at dose levels 0 and 1, whereas 9
(45%) of 20 patients treated at doses equal or higher
to the MTD achieved cytogenetic responses: CCyR

(n 5 3, 12%), PCyR (n 5 4, 16%), and minimal cytogenetic response (n 5 2, 8%). Hematologic responses
were observed in 8 of 13 patients (62%) with ABL kinase domain mutations, including 4 who had a cytogenetic response (1 with T315I, 2 with M244V, and 1
with E255K). Patients with PCyR had the percentage
of Ph-positive metaphases reduced from 100% to
30%, 65% to 30%, 55% to 10%, and 95% to 15%,
respectively. It is interesting to note that the latter
PCyR (15% Ph-positive) occurred in a patient in
whom the imatinib-insensitive T315I mutation was
predominant. This response lasted for 2 months
before the patient was taken off-protocol to undergo
matched unrelated stem cell transplantation. The
median duration of cytogenetic response was 3
months (range, 2–391 months). Responses were sustained for more than 6 months in 3 patients, including 2 ongoing CCyR (121 months and 391 months,
respectively). The median time to MCyR was 3
months, corresponding to the first assessment of
response in most patients. However, 1 patient who
had achieved a PCyR 16 months after the initiation
of therapy obtained a CCyR after 33 months on the
study therapy.
Molecular responses were assessable in 16
patients (62%) (6 [38%] had a 1-log and 1 [6%]
patient had a 2-log reduction of their BCR-ABL transcript levels). After a median follow-up of 6.5 months
(range, 1–38 months), 2 patients were still in CCyR
receiving the study treatment. The remaining 24 had
withdrawn from tipifarnib and imatinib therapy due
to progression to AP (6 patients), side effects (5
patients), lack of response (5 patients), loss/lack of
cytogenetic response (4 patients), lost to follow-up

(2 patients), patient’s request (1 patient), and death
(1 patient).

DISCUSSION
Single-agent oral tipifarnib has modest activity in
CML. In 1 study, tipifarnib was administered to 22
patients with CML in all phases after IFN-a failure
(and 70% after imatinib failure).15 Six of 10 patients
in CP and 1 of 6 in AP had a hematologic response
(CHR in 5).15 In a phase 1 study of tipifarnib, 2
patients in BP achieved a partial hematologic
response.16 Importantly, tipifarnib is synergistic with
imatinib, both in imatinib-sensitive and imatinibresistant cell lines,17–19 providing the rationale for the
clinical development of this combination.
In this study, the combination of tipifarnib
and imatinib was well tolerated at doses of 400 mg
twice daily and 400 mg daily, respectively, which
defined the MTD. The most frequent adverse events
were gastrointestinal but these were generally mild
and manageable. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia
were the most frequent grade 3 to 4 toxicities
and the main reason for treatment discontinuation.
However, treatment-related myelosuppression did
not result in fatal outcomes and led to hospitalization
in only 15% of patients. There was no routine use of
growth factors in this study, an approach that could
potentially be used to minimize myelosuppression.
This combination demonstrated significant clinical activity, with hematologic and cytogenetic
response rates of 62% and 36%, respectively. Cytogenetic responses were observed in 45% of patients
treated at doses at least equal to the MTD. This
response rate is slightly lower than the cytogenetic
responses observed in phase 1/2 studies of nilotinib
(50%)21 and dasatinib (44%)22 after imatinib failure.
However, a potential advantage of FTIs over tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is their activity against
quiescent leukemic stem cells. BCR-ABL-positive
CD341/Lin2 leukemic stem cells of patients with
CP CML remained viable even in the presence of
growth factors and imatinib,3 potentially facilitating
recurrence and development of resistance to imatinib.23,24 Although dasatinib is significantly more
potent than imatinib, quiescent stem cells appear
innately insensitive to both agents.25 Moreover, several imatinib-resistant ABL kinase domain mutations have been detected in CD341/BCR-ABL1
progenitors.26 BMS-214662, a nonpeptidomimetic
FTI, was 68-fold more potent in killing quiescent
(IC50 0.7 lM) than proliferating (IC50 47.5 lM) K562
cells and exhibited supra-additive cytotoxicity with
imatinib in murine K562 xenografts.27 Another FTI,
lonafarnib, had similar effects against quiescent

Tipifarnib and Imatinib in CML/Cortes et al.

CD341 leukemic cells from patients with CML in
CP, and inhibited their ability to efflux imatinib.28
Conceivably, a ‘cocktail’ of agents with distinct
mechanisms of action might prevent the emergence
of resistance to TKIs. Particularly appealing would
be to combine FTIs with dasatinib, which target 3
crucial elements of Bcr-Abl signaling: Abl kinase,
Src family kinases, and Ras activation. Such an
approach could be more efficacious if introduced
early (ie, suboptimal responses rather than failures),
before the development of TKI resistance.17–19
An interesting observation in this study was the
response in 1 patient with T315I. This mutation is
completely insensitive to imatinib, nilotinib, and
dasatinib. The contribution of imatinib to the
response in this patient is uncertain but the remarkable reduction of Ph-positive cells supports the ability of the combination therapy to eliminate mutated
clones and leukemic stem cells. It would be important
to confirm this observation in additional patients
given the lack of effective therapeutic strategies in
this setting.
The results of the current study demonstrated
that tipifarnib combined with imatinib is safe for
patients with CML in CP after imatinib failure and
induces cytogenetic responses. Studies combining
FTI with new TKIs and exploring earlier intervention
with this combination are warranted, with a focus on
exploring the potential elimination of the leukemic
stem cell.
