BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of herpes simplex virus (HSV) isolated in lower respiratory tract
specimens (LRTS) of patients with solid tumors (ST) is unknown. In the current study, the authors
attempted to determine the clinical relevance of this finding among ST patients. METHODS: The authors
reviewed records of ST patients admitted to the study institution between April 2000 and April 2004 with
clinical and radiologic evidence of pneumonia, and HSV identified in LRTS by culture alone or culture and
cytology. Patients were categorized as having proven (HSV identified by culture and cytology from the
LRTS), probable (HSV as the sole pathogen by culture alone), and possible (HSV along with copathogens
identified by culture) HSV pneumonia. RESULTS: Forty-five ST patients with either proven (6 patients),
probable (25 patients), or possible (14 patients) HSV pneumonia were identified. When compared with
patients with probable or possible HSV pneumonia, more patients with proven infection were on mechanical ventilation (40% vs 50% vs 100%, respectively; P ¼ .03), and had longer length of stay in the intensive
care unit (12 days vs 13 days vs 26 days, respectively; P ¼ .05). The overall mortality rate was 22% (10
patients). Four of 25 (16%) patients who received HSV-directed antiviral therapy died during their hospital
stay versus 6 of 20 (30%) who were not treated (P ¼ .3). None of the 6 patients with proven HSV pneumonia who were treated with acyclovir died. On univariate analysis, risk factors for mortality included underlying breast cancer, an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score >15, admission to
the intensive care unit, and use of mechanical ventilation and vasopressors (all P  .05), with underlying
breast cancer and APACHE II score >15 being found to be independent predictors of death by multiple
logistic regression analysis (all P  .05). CONCLUSIONS: Having a proven HSV pneumonia appears to be
associated with high morbidity and with no increase in mortality in ST patients. This subset of patients

patients with lymphoreticular malignancies,4,5 human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection,5-8 leukemia,7
or burns8-10; those who have undergone organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)5,11-13; or
those who have received cytotoxic or immunosuppressive
agents.5,7,8 HSV pneumonia has been rarely reported in
patients with solid tumors; to our knowledge, the clinical
significance of HSV in lower respiratory tract specimens
(LRTS) and the importance of these infections remains
unknown in this patient population.
In the absence of histopathologic documentation of
HSV in pulmonary tissue, the diagnosis of HSV pneumonia is often difficult to establish, because HSV can be
asymptomatically shed in up to 5% of adults5 and possibly at higher rates in the immunocompromised population. To our knowledge, the clinical significance of a
positive culture for HSV in fluid specimens obtained
from the lower respiratory tract in patients with solid
tumors has not been evaluated. In the absence of defined
criteria to diagnose this infection, physicians might rely
on clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic information
with or without histopathologic data to diagnose this infectious entity in immunocompromised patients.
We therefore conducted a retrospective study to
evaluate the clinical relevance of positive HSV culture
with or without positive viral cytopathic effect in LRTS
obtained from patients with solid tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
We reviewed the microbiology reports for all patients with
solid tumors cared for at the University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center between April 2000 and April
2004 to identify patients with positive HSV culture from
LRTS. Information regarding patient demographics; type of
solid tumor; comorbidities; type of cancer treatment (ie,
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids, and surgery);
neutropenia (absolute count of <500 neutrophils/lL), lymphopenia (absolute count of <1000 lymphocytes/lL), and
severe lymphopenia (absolute count of <500 lymphocytes/
lL); pulmonary coinfection; clinical and radiologic signs of
pneumonia; admission to the intensive care unit; need for
mechanical ventilation and/or vasopressors; HSV-directed

antiviral prophylaxis or therapy; severe hypoxic respiratory
failure (PaO2/FIO2 ratio of <150)14; Acute Physiology and
Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score; and outcome was collected from patient records. The institutional
review board approved this study, and informed consent
was waived.
Laboratory Analysis of LRTS
For viral identification, LRTS are routinely examined for
cultures by shell vial or immunofluorescent staining for
cytomegalovirus (CMV), HSV, respiratory viruses (ie, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza viruses, adenovirus,
and parainfluenza viruses), and histopathology pertaining
to viral cytopathic effects. In addition, bacterial, fungal,
and mycobacterial cultures, Giemsa stains for fungi and
Pneumocystis jiroveci, and immunohistochemistry assay
for CMV were performed routinely on the LRTS.
Patients
Patients were included in this study if they had positive
culture for HSV with or without cytopathic effects consistent with HSV replication in LRTS in the presence of
clinical and radiologic findings compatible with viral pulmonary infection.4,7 Patients with solid tumors who
underwent HSCT before the diagnosis of HSV pneumonia were excluded. Patients who met the inclusion criteria
of viral pneumonia were classified as having proven HSV
pneumonia if HSV was identified by culture in the LRTS
with viral cytopathic effect in cells obtained from the same
specimens, probable HSV pneumonia if HSV was the sole
pathogen identified by culture in LRTS, and possible
HSV pneumonia if HSV along with copathogens were
identified by culture in LRTS.
Treatment for HSV Pneumonia and
Outcome of Patients
Treatment for HSV pneumonia consisted of either the
intravenous administration of acyclovir (10 mg/kg every
8 hours), oral valacyclovir (1 g every 8 hours), or oral
famciclovir (500 mg every 8 hours). The outcome
recorded was the status of patients at the last day of hospitalization after the diagnosis of HSV pneumonia. We
calculated the mortality rates for the entire cohort as well
as for those patients who did or did not receive HSVdirected antiviral therapy.

Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were presented as median values
and compared by the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U
test when applicable. Categoric variables were compared
by Fisher exact or chi-square tests (with Yates correction
when applicable). In addition, multiple logistic regression
method was used to identify patient-related characteristics
independently associated with fatal outcome. First, univariate models were fit to evaluate the predictive effect of
each factor alone. Then, all variables with P  .05 on the
univariate analysis were included in a full multivariate
model. Finally, the full multivariate model was reduced 1
factor at a time such that all factors remaining in the
model were statistically significant at a significance level
of 5%. The potential associations in both univariate and
multivariate analyses were summarized by calculating
odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals.
A 2-tailed P  .05 was considered statistically significant.
The statistical analysis was performed using MedCalc
(version 7.4.4.1; Schoonjans, Belgium).

RESULTS
Patient and Disease Characteristics
Forty-five patients with either proven (6 patients), probable (25 patients), or possible (14 patients) HSV pneumonia were identified. We excluded 1 patient because HSV
was isolated from the LRTS, but there was no radiologic
evidence of pneumonia.
The culture samples were obtained from bronchial
washing in 7 patients (5 of them while on mechanical ventilation), bronchoalveolar lavage in 36 patients (17 intubated), or both in 2 patients (1 intubated).
The median age of our entire cohort was 64 years
(range, 29-81 years) (Table 1). The majority of patients
had cancer involving the lungs or the gastrointestinal
tract. The median APACHE II score at the time of diagnosis of HSV pneumonia was 10 (range, 0-25). Approximately two-thirds of patients were admitted to the
intensive care unit, and the median duration of stay was
17 days (range, 2-258 days). Half of the patients required
mechanical ventilation, and the median duration of ventilation was 13 days (range, 2-258 days).
Lymphopenia was common at diagnosis of HSV
pneumonia, and severe lymphopenia was present in nearly
Cancer

half of the entire cohort (Table 1). The median duration
of lymphopenia was 8 days (range, 1-10 days). Few
patients were neutropenic at the time of diagnosis of HSV
pneumonia. The median duration of neutropenia was 3
days (range, 1-6 days).
Comorbidities, other then the diagnosis of cancer,
were observed in approximately 25% of patients (Table 1).
Six patients had chronic pulmonary disease; 3 had diabetes
mellitus; and 1 patient each had end-stage renal disease,
major surgery, and liver disease plus end-stage renal disease.
Within 30 days of diagnosis of HSV pneumonia,
corticosteroids were administered to 23 patients (51%)
(Table 1). Radiotherapy to the head, neck, or chest was
administered to 5 patients, and chemotherapy was administered to 1 patient only.
HSV was the only pathogen recovered from LRTS
of 4 patients with proven HSV pneumonia (66%).
Among the 16 patients who had pulmonary copathogens
identified at the time of diagnosis of HSV pneumonia, 9
had >1 copathogen identified. Approximately 67% of the
copathogens were bacteria, 25% were fungi, and the remainder were viruses (Table 2). Five (11%) patients had a
concomitant HSV oropharyngeal infection at the time of
the diagnosis of HSV pneumonia; 1 of these patients had
proven, 3 had probable, and 1 had possible infection.
Clinical, Bronchoscopic, and Cytologic
Findings
The clinical manifestations of HSV pneumonia were nonspecific and included dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and
cough. Twenty (44%) patients had fever. The results of
chest roentgenography were abnormal in all patients.
Thirty-two (71%) patients had alveolar infiltrates, 7
(16%) had interstitial infiltrates, and 4 (9%) had nodular
infiltrates. Cavitation and acute respiratory distress syndrome were observed in 1 patient each (2% each).
Data regarding bronchoscopic findings were available for 40 patients. Seven patients had a normal respiratory mucosa, 20 had 1 abnormality in the mucosa, and 13
patients had >1 macroscopic abnormality. The macroscopic findings included mucopurulent respiratory secretions (n ¼ 23), diffuse erythema (n ¼ 11), mucosal edema
(n ¼ 9), and nodules (n ¼ 3). No patient had ulcerations
or mucosal vesicles.
Data regarding cytologic analysis of LRTS were
available in 22 specimens.

days) after the initiation of therapy, with HSV no longer
isolated in these patients’ follow-up specimens.
Mortality Rates and Predictors of Death
Ten (22%) patients of the entire cohort died. Four (16%)
of the 25 patients treated with antiviral agents died, and 6
(30%) of the 20 patients who did not receive antiviral
agents died (P ¼ .3).
Among the 25 patients who received antiviral therapy, the mortality rate varied with infection status, being
0% (0 of 5 patients) among those with proven, 14% (2 of
14 patients) among those with probable, and 33% (2 of 6
patients) among those with possible HSV pneumonia. All
patients with proven HSV pneumonia received acyclovir.
To assess the clinical relevance of a positive culture for
HSV in LRTS, we analyzed further the outcome of the 20
patients who did not receive HSV-directed antiviral therapy
(Table 4). Patients from this latter group were more likely
to die if they had breast cancer, comorbidity, or an
APACHE II score 15, were admitted to the intensive care
unit, or required mechanical ventilation (all P  .05).
Univariate analysis of the entire cohort indicated
that underlying breast cancer, possible HSV pneumonia,
Cancer

January 1, 2009

APACHE II score 15, admission to the intensive care
unit, use of mechanical ventilation, and use of vasopressors were predictive of death (Table 5). Multiple logistic
regression analysis revealed that underlying breast cancer
and APACHE II score of 15 were independent predictors of death. Proven HSV pneumonia appeared not to be
significantly associated with fatal outcome.

To our knowledge, this is the first reported series assessing
the clinical significance of positive HSV culture in specimens obtained from the lower respiratory tract in patients
with solid tumors. We found that ST patients with proven
HSV pneumonia had higher morbidity but no increase in
mortality rate when compared with patients with either
possible or probable HSV pneumonia.
HSV commonly infects patients with impaired cellular immunity, and in the current series, the majority of
patients had lymphopenia, along with impaired T-cell immunity related to the prior use of corticosteroids in
approximately half of the cases. We found that the radiologic manifestations of HSV pneumonia were nonspecific
and of limited diagnostic benefit, as observed in prior
studies.7,15,16
Pulmonary coinfection was fairly common in our
patients with HSV pneumonia (36%), but the incidence
was much lower than the 65% incidence of concomitant
pulmonary infection found by Ramsey et al17 in a postmortem series of immunocompromised patients with
HSV pneumonia, the majority of whom had undergone
HSCT. This discrepancy might be because of a better net
state of immunosuppression in the current study patients
when compared with HSCT recipients.
In the absence of standardized diagnostic criteria for
HSV pneumonia, definitive diagnosis usually depends on
the detection of the virus in lung tissue.8 However, lung
biopsy is rarely performed in patients with cancer because
of the great risk of complications from this invasive procedure. In addition, neither percutaneous lung biopsy nor
open lung biopsy always yields the diagnosis of HSV
infection,1,17 most likely because HSV pneumonia is often an intrabronchial process.4 In the current study, no
patient had biopsy-proven HSV pneumonia, and all cases
were diagnosed microbiologically with or without cytologic evidence of HSV infection from lower respiratory

tract specimens obtained by bronchoscopy. Although isolation of HSV by culture from such specimens does not
distinguish between active disease, asymptomatic shedding, and oropharyngeal contamination with HSV,6 all
our patients also had clinical and radiologic evidence of
pneumonia, and only 11% had concomitant HSV oropharyngeal infection when bronchoscopy was performed.
Our findings suggest that the isolation of HSV from respiratory secretions of patients with solid tumors should

be considered significant in patients who are critically ill
(ie, those with a high APACHE II score).
In the current series, greater than half of the patients
were treated with antiviral therapy, mainly acyclovir.
HSV is susceptible to acyclovir as well as other antiviral
agents such as foscarnet, cidofovir, and, to a lesser extent,
ganciclovir.18 In the overall population, the use of any
active antiviral agent against HSV impacted mortality
(Table 3). However, no patient died in the subset of

antiviral treated patients with proven HSV pneumonia,
which might indicate a possible role of antiviral therapy in
documented HSV infections.
The mortality rate of nonsolid tumor patients with
HSV isolated from LRTS has been reported to be as high
as 27%.8 In the current series, a similar proportion (22%)
of solid tumor patients with HSV pneumonia died. We
found that having a proven HSV pneumonia appeared
not to be associated with a statistically significant increase
in mortality. HSV isolation from LRTS apparently has
different implications depending upon the immunologic
status of the patient.5 Of note, among the 6 patients with
breast cancer in the current series, 4 patients did not
receive antiviral therapy, and all died with HSV pneumonia, whereas the remaining 2 patients were treated with
antiviral therapy and survived. It has been reported that
patients with breast cancer might have impaired cellmediated immune responses, with reduced natural killer
activity in the patients with stage III or IV cancer.19
Whether antiviral therapy can decrease the mortality rate
in solid tumor patients with HSV pneumonia could not
be assessed in this retrospective study.
The current study is limited by its retrospective nature
and the range of cancer types in our patient population. Furthermore, therapeutic decisions regarding management
were left to the discretion of the treating physician. Finally,
our study design was not intended to evaluate either the preventive or the therapeutic role of antiviral therapy.
In conclusion, the clinical relevance of diagnosing
HSV pneumonia in patients with solid tumors and the
outcome of these patients may depend on the underlying
type of cancer and the severity of illness at the time of presentation. Having proven HSV pneumonia appeared to
be significantly associated with increased length of stay
and mechanical ventilation but had no impact on mortality rate in patients with solid tumors. Patients with proven
HSV pneumonia might benefit from acyclovir therapy.
