Abstract
Synthetic triterpenoids 2-cyano-3, 12-dioxooleana-1, 9-(11)dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) and CDDO-Me (CDDO-methyl ester)
have entered clinical trials for cancer. We determined that
CDDO analogues at submicromolar concentrations induce
apoptosis of cultured prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP,
ALVA31, Du145, PC3, and PPC1, with lethal dose 50% f1
Mmol/L for CDDO-Me and an imidazole analogue (CDDO-Im).
These compounds induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells
as characterized by cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase8, caspase-9, caspase-10, BID, and poly(ADP)ribose polymerase and by dependence on caspase activity. Moreover,
triterpenoid-induced cell death was abolished by caspase-8–
targeting small interfering (si) RNA. To explore the mechanism(s) involved in caspase-8 activation, we examined cell
surface expression of death receptor (DR)4 and DR5 after
triterpenoid treatment. Cell surface DR4 and DR5 expression
was significantly up-regulated by CDDO or CDDO-Im but not
by CDDO-Me. DR4 and DR5 knockdown with siRNA significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by CDDO and CDDO-Im
but had no effect on CDDO-Me–induced killing, suggesting
that CDDO and CDDO-Im induce apoptosis by a different
mechanism than CDDO-Me. In addition to activating the
caspase-8–dependent extrinsic apoptosis pathway, we observed that Bcl-XL overexpression inhibited triterpenoidmediated killing of prostate cancer cell line Du145, suggesting
that the intrinsic pathway (via mitochondria) also participates
in triterpenoid-mediated killing. In vivo antitumor activity
of CDDO-Me was shown using a Du145 tumor xenograft model
in nude rats. Altogether, these findings suggest CDDO and
related synthetic triterpenoids should be further evaluated as
potential novel therapeutics for hormone refractory prostate
cancers. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2927–33]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is projected to be the leading cause of
potentially lethal cancer in the Western world in 2007, killing
nearly 90,000 men in the United States alone (1). Once the cancer

invades beyond the gland and becomes metastatic, no curative
treatment currently exists. Thus, a need exists to identify and
develop novel therapies to treat advanced prostate cancer.
Synthetic triterpenoids represent a novel group of small
molecules currently being evaluated as anticancer agents in
preclinical models and in clinical trials. The synthetic triterpenoids
2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9-(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO), imidazole derivative (CDDO-Im), and methyl ester derivative (CDDOMe) have been shown to induce apoptosis of a wide variety of
cancer cells in culture (2–5). In addition, triterpenoids have been
shown to suppress growth of human tumor xenografts in mouse
models of breast cancer (6–8). The two best-characterized
apoptotic pathways are the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. In
the extrinsic pathway, ligation of the death receptors, such as
Fas/CD95, TNFR1, death receptor (DR)4, and DR5, triggers the
recruitment of adaptor proteins that activate either caspase-8 or
caspase-10. Active caspases-8 and caspase-10, in turn, cleave and
activate downstream effector proteases, including caspases-3 and
caspase-7, causing apoptosis. In the intrinsic pathway, mitochondria are the critical mediators of apoptosis. In response to diverse
stimuli, mitochondria release a variety of cell death–inducing
proteins into the cytosol, including cytochrome c, which activates
caspase-9, and then cleaves and activates downstream effector
proteases (9).
The mechanism-of-action (MOA) triterpenoids use to induce
apoptosis of cancer cells is not fully understood. Numerous reports
link the MOA to the intrinsic cell death pathway, whereas others
suggest triterpenoids induce apoptosis through the extrinsic
apoptotic pathway. Here, we report that prostate cancer cells are
sensitive to CDDO and its analogues, unlike many other tumor cell
types, and we interrogate the apoptotic MOA of triterpenoids in
these cells. CDDO and analogues exhibit potent single-agent
activity, inducing apoptosis of five of five human prostate cancer
cell lines at submicromolar concentrations in culture. Our studies
implicate components of both the extrinsic and intrinsic cell death
pathways in the apoptotic MOA of these synthetic triterpenoids
in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, we show for the first time
in vivo antitumor activity for one of the CDDO analogues, using
hormone refractory and chemoresistant human prostate cancer
cells in a rodent xenograft model.

factor (TNF) were purchased from Sigma; the anti-Fas antibody (CH-11) from
MBL; TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) from R&D; SP600125
from Calbiochem; Acetyl-Aspartyl-Glutamyl-Valinyl-Aspartyl-aminofluorocoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AFC) from Biomol International. Antibodies for
immunoblotting experiments included the following: caspase-8 (clone
5B4; Upstate), caspase-10 (clone 4C1; MBL), BID (Cell Signaling), caspase-9
(clone 5B4l; MBL), caspase-3 (BD), caspase-7 (Cell Signaling), poly(ADP)ribose
polymerase (PARP; clone C2-10; BD), a-tubulin (Sigma), p-c-Jun (Santa Cruz),
cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAP)-1 (R&D), and XIAP (BD).
RNAi knockdown. PPC-1 cells were transfected with 21 bp nucleotide
synthetic double-strand RNA molecules (siRNA) directed against caspase-8,
DR4, or DR5, or with scrambled siRNA as a control (Ambion) using
LipoFectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 2 d based on the manufacturer’s
instructions. Immunoblotting was used to determine the relative level of
protein knockdown.
Apoptosis detection by DAPI staining. Cells were fixed using 70%
ethanol for 30 min and then stained for 30 min with DAPI at final
concentration of 0.3 Ag/mL. Cells were analyzed for the presence of
fragmented nuclei and condensed chromatin by UV microscopy.
Apoptosis detection by Annexin V staining. Cells (3  105) were
seeded in 6-well plates. The next day, cells were treated with increasing
concentrations of CDDO, CDDO-Im, or CDDO-Me. After indicated times,
cells were stained with Annexin V and propidium iodide using the Annexin
V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Biovision) per instructions of the
manufacturer. Cells (10,000/treatment) were analyzed using a flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson FACSort).
Caspase assay. Cell lysates were prepared using hypertonic buffer
[10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 10 mmol/L KCl, and
0.5 mmol/L DTT], normalized for protein content (20 ug), and adjusted
to 100 AL volume in caspase assay buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4),
100 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L EDTA, and
10% glycerol], then 100 Amol/L Ac-DEVD-AFC was added and fluorescence
was measured using a spectrofluorimeter (11). Data were expressed as fold
increase over control.
ATP measurements. Measurements of intracellular ATP were used as a
surrogate for cell death. For these experiments, cells (104) were seeded into
white 96-well plates (Lumitrac 600; Greiner Bio One) in a final volume of
100 AL. The next day, cells were treated with drug as indicated and
incubated for 24 h. ATPlite solution (100 AL) was added, and a luminomitor
(Monolight 3096; BD Biosciences) was used to measure luminescence.
Relative cell viability was calculated using the following formula: treatment/
control %. All assays were performed in triplicate (mean F SD).
Flow cytometry for measuring cell surface DR4 & DR5. PPC-1 cells
were seeded in 6-well plates. The next day, cells were treated with CDDO,
CDDO-Im, or CDDO-Me for 16 h. Cells were detached by Enzyme
Detachment Medium (eBioscience), washed with ice-cold PBS, and stained
for 30 min with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-DR4, anti-DR5, or isotypematched antibody (eBioscience). Cells (10,000 per treatment) were analyzed
using a flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson FACSort).
Immunoblotting. Floating and adherent cells were collected and then
lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (PBS, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitor cocktail from Sigma), incubated on ice for
30 min, passed eight times through a 21-gauge needle, further incubated on
ice for 30 min, pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000  g for 20 min, and the
supernatant was stored at 80jC. The DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) was used
to determine protein concentrations. Cell lysates (35–75 Ag) were subjected
to SDS-PAGE (8–12% gels) and blotted onto 0.45-Am nitrocellulose
membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). Membranes were probed with the
primary antibodies overnight at 4jC. Secondary antibodies used were
horseradish peroxidase conjugated (Amersham). Proteins were visualized
using an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Supersignal; Pierce).
In vivo nude rat xenograft experiments. Male nude rats (4–5-wk-old),
homozygous for the rnu gene (rnu+/rnu+; Harlan Sprague-Dawley), were
used for tumor xenograft studies. Animals were s.c. inoculated with 106
Du145 prostate cancer cells in a volume of 0.05 mL (containing 50%
Matrigel in PBS) on their lower left flank. Eight days later, animals were
randomized into the following three treatment groups (n = 6 per group):

group 1 received vehicle (sesame oil) by p.o. gavage once daily for 14 d;
group 2 received 100 mg/kg CDDO-Me twice daily on days 1, 4, 7, 10, 13,
16, and 19 (every 3 d); and group 3 received 100 mg/kg CDDO-Me bid on
days 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17 (every 4 d). Tumors were measured every other
day with microcalipers, and tumor volume was calculated as (length 

1 (mean tumor volume of treatment group on day 21/mean tumor volume
of control group on day 21). Statistics were performed using a two-tailed
Student’s t test.

Results
Synthetic triterpenoids potently induce apoptosis of cultured human prostate cancer cell lines. To determine the
in vitro cytotoxic activity of CDDO, CDDO-Im, and CDDO-Me
against cultured prostate cancer cells, a panel of prostate cancer
cell lines, including androgen-sensitive LN-CaP and the hormone
refractory lines PPC-1, PC-3, ALVA-31, and Du145, were treated
with these three synthetic triterpenoids for 72 hours, and then
the percentage of dead cells was determined by staining with
FITC-Annexin V. All three triterpenoids induced concentrationdependent cell death of all five cell lines tested (Fig. 1A). CDDO-Im
and CDDO-Me were approximately five times more potent than
CDDO with respect to cytotoxic activity against all lines examined.

To investigate whether triterpenoids induce cell death via
apoptosis, various apoptotic signaling molecules were analyzed
by immunoblotting after triterpenoid treatment of Du145, PPC1,
and LN-CaP cells. CDDO, CDDO-Im, and CDDO-Me induced
cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, BID, and PARP in
Du145 cells (Fig. 1B), supporting the theory that triterpenoids
induce a caspase cascade in prostate cancer cells. Similar results
were found for LN-CaP cells and PPC-1 cells (data not shown).
In addition, triterpenoids induced down-regulation of the antiapoptotic proteins XIAP (by CDDO and CDDO-Me) and cIAP-1
(by CDDO-Im); however, this was reversed by pretreatment with the
pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 1C), suggesting a downstream consequence rather than cause of triterpenoid-induced cell
death. In contrast, triterpenoids were found to down-regulate
FLICE/caspase-8-inhibitory protein (FLIP)L through a caspaseindependent mechanism in LN-CaP (Fig. 1C) and Du145 (data not
shown) because z-VAD-fmk did not prevent this down-regulation.
These data are consistent with our prior studies of CDDO in
leukemia (12) and breast cancer cells (13). However, reducing FLIP
expression by RNAi did not significantly induce apoptosis in
prostate cells (data not shown), suggesting that FLIP downregulation alone does not lead to apoptosis and implying that
other mechanisms are involved.

Figure 3. DR4 and DR5 are required for CDDO
and CDDO-Im but not CDDO-Me–induced apoptosis.
A, PPC-1 cells were treated with either CDDO
(5 Amol/L), CDDO-Me (0.5 Amol/L), or CDDO-Im
(0.5 Amol/L) for 16 h, then cells were stained with
phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated antibodies directed
against either DR4, DR5, or an isotype-matched
control; shaded region, vehicle treatment stained
with isotype-matched control; thin line, vehicle
treatment stained with anti-DR4 or anti-DR5;
thick line, triterpenoid treatment stained with anti-DR4
or anti-DR5. B, PPC-1 cells were transfected with
either scrambled siRNA or siRNA directed against the
DR4 and DR5 receptors. At 48 h after transfection,
cells were treated either with TRAIL (50 ng/mL),
staurosporin (1 Amol/L), CDDO (5 Amol/L), CDDO-Im
(0.5 Amol/L), or CDDO-Me (0.5 Amol/L) for 24 h.
Cells were then stained with DAPI and scored
for apoptotic morphology based on chromatin
condensation. Data in the graph represent percentage
of apoptotic cells from two independent experiments
(200 cells scored per condition).

Triterpenoids Induce Prostate Cancer Apoptosis

Figure 4. The intrinsic pathway is also
involved in triterpenoid-mediated killing
of prostate cancer cells. Stable Bcl-XL
overexpressing Du145 cells were treated
with either CDDO, CDDO-Im, CDDO-Me,
STS, or cycloheximide+TNF for 24 h,
and then cell viability was determined using
the ATPlite assay (n = 3). Points, mean;
bars, SE.

Apoptosis induced by synthetic triterpenoids in prostate
cancer cells is caspase-8 dependent. We evaluated the kinetics of
triterpenoid-induced apoptosis (Annexin V staining) and measured
caspase activity (DEVD hydrolysis) to initiate mechanistic studies
for prostate cancer cells (Fig. 2A). Using CDDO-Me as a
prototypical synthetic triterpenoid, we observed caspase activation,
with elevations in DEVDase activity present within 4 hours,
peaking at f12 hours and then declining in PPC-1 prostate cancer
cells. Apoptosis (Annexin V staining) was also rapidly induced by
CDDO-Me, with elevations detected within 8 hours. Because
triterpenoids induce caspase cleavage (Fig. 1B) and activation
(Fig. 2A), we tested if triterpenoid-mediated apoptosis was
dependent on caspase activation. LN-CaP cells were pretreated
with or without the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk and then
challenged with CDDO, CDDO-Im, or CDDO-Me. Z-VAD-fmk
significantly abolished triterpenoid-mediated cell killing (Fig. 2B),
underscoring the importance of caspase activation in the
triterpenoid-mediated death mechanism. Similar results were
observed for PPC-1 cells and Du145 cells (data not shown).
The cleavage of caspase-8 by triterpenoids (Fig. 1B) suggested
that the extrinsic pathway was involved in triterpenoid-mediated
cell death. To determine if caspase-8 is necessary for triterpenoidinduced apoptosis, siRNA was used to knock down caspase8 expression in PPC-1 cells, and these cells were then challenged
with either CDDO, CDDO-Im, or CDDO-Me. Treatment with
caspase-8 siRNA reduced caspase-8 expression to undetectable
levels as determined by immunoblotting compared with the

www.aacrjournals.org

scrambled siRNA control (Fig. 2C). The siRNA-treated PPC-1
cells were then challenged with triterpenoids, anti-Fas antibody
(which induces caspase-8–dependent cell death), or staurosporin
(which induces caspase-8–independent cell death). Triterpenoidinduced prostate cancer cell death was significantly inhibited by
caspase-8 siRNA, suggesting that triterpenoids induced apoptosis
of these cells through a caspase-8–dependent mechanism. As
expected, cell death induced by anti-Fas antibody was completely
blocked by caspase-8 siRNA, whereas staurosporin-induced cell
death was unaffected (Fig. 2D).
Apoptosis induced by CDDO and CDDO-Im, but not CDDOMe, is dependent on DR4 and DR5 death receptor expression.
Previous reports showed that triterpenoids induced apoptosis in
lung (2) and breast cancer cells (13) by up-regulating death
receptors. We tested whether triterpenoids affect death receptor
expression in prostate cancer cells. Cell surface expression of the
death receptors DR4 and DR5 were analyzed by flow cytometry
using fluorescently labeled antibodies directed against DR4, DR5,
or (as a control) matched isotype controls. Both CDDO and CDDOIm significantly up-regulated cell surface DR4 and DR5 expression
in PPC-1 cells (Fig. 3A), consistent with similar findings in breast
cancer cells (13). In contrast, CDDO-Me did not affect cell surface
DR4 or DR5 expression in PPC-1.
To confirm the role of death receptors in triterpenoid-mediated
apoptosis, we knocked down both DR4 and DR5 using RNAi. DR4/
DR5 RNAi significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by TRAIL but
not that by staurosporin, suggesting that the DR4/DR5 knockdown

Cancer Research

was efficient and specific (Fig. 3B). More importantly, DR4/DR5
RNAi significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by CDDO and
CDDO-Im. These data suggest a mechanism whereby CDDO and
CDDO-Im up-regulate cell surface DR4 and DR5 receptors, leading
to cell surface death receptor aggregation, caspase-8 activation,
and subsequent cell death. In contrast, DR4/DR5 RNAi did not
affect the apoptosis induced by CDDO-Me, further supporting the
hypothesis that CDDO-Me induces caspase-8–dependent apoptosis
independent of DR4 and DR5.
It was recently reported that in lung cancer cells, CDDO and
CDDO-Im induce death receptor–mediated apoptosis through a
c-Jun-NH2-kinase (JNK)-dependent pathway (2). We found that all
three triterpenoids activated JNK activity in PPC-1 cells, as
evidenced by increased phosphorylation of c-Jun (Supplementary
Data). However, the JNK-specific inhibitor, SP600125, inhibited
triterpenoid-induced JNK activation but not cell death induced by
triterpenoids (Supplementary Data), indicating that the triterpenoid-induced cell death mechanism is JNK-independent, at least in
prostate cancer cells.
Bcl-XL overexpression inhibits triterpenoid-mediated cell
death. To explore whether mitochondria play a role in triterpenoidmediated killing of prostate cancer cells, we generated a stable
Bcl-XL overexpressing Du145 cell line (10). As expected, Bcl-XL
overexpressing Du145 cells were more resistant to staurosporin
(Fig. 4), a classic mitochondrial/intrinsic pathway cell death inducer.
In contrast, a treatment known to exclusively induce apoptosis
through the extrinsic cell death pathway, cycloheximide + TNF, was
minimally reduced by Bcl-XL overexpression. Bcl-XL overexpressing
Du145 cells were much more resistant to CDDO, CDDO-Im, and
CDDO-Me, suggesting that the mitochondria/intrinsic pathway is
involved in triterpenoid-mediated cell death. Attempts to explore
the role of caspase-9 in prostate cancer cell lines using RNAi proved
unsuccessful, as we were unable to achieve significant reductions in
caspase-9 protein levels despite designing >10 different RNAis (data
not shown). However, in addition, we observed that mouse
embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells deficient in caspase-9 were much
more resistant to triterpenoid-mediated cell death (Supplementary
Data), supporting the hypothesis that triterpenoids (even at

submicromolar concentrations) are capable of mediating cell death
through the mitochondrial/intrinsic pathway.
CDDO-Me inhibits growth of prostate cancer in a nude rat
xenograft model. CDDO-Me and CDDO-Im were more potent
than CDDO in terms of killing prostate cancer cells in vitro
(Fig. 1A). Because CDDO-Me is currently in phase I clinical trials,
we tested the anticancer effect of CDDO-Me on prostate cancer in a
nude rat model (Fig. 5). Animals bearing Du145 xenograft tumors
were treated over a 21-day period with diluent control (group 1),
with 100 mg/kg of CDDO-Me twice daily on every third day
(group 2) or on every fourth day (group 3) for a total of either
10 (group 2) or 14 (group 3) doses. Both treatment schedules were
well-tolerated and significantly reduced Du145 tumor growth
compared with the vehicle control. On day 21, the mean tumor
volumes for groups 1 (vehicle), 2, and 3 were 1,924, 444 (P < 0.001),
and 764 mm3 (P = 0.005), respectively; and the TGI for groups 2 and
3 was 76.9% and 60.3%, respectively. The difference between the
two treatment groups was also significant (P = 0.04).

Discussion
In this report, we provide preclinical evidence of single-agent
apoptotic activity of CDDO-related synthetic triterpenoids against
human prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Cytotoxic activity
of CDDO-related compounds (specifically the methyl-ester and
imidazole derivatives) is apparent at submicromolar concentrations, suggesting that prostate cancer cells are particularly sensitive
to these agents. Different mechanisms have been proposed for the
cytotoxic activity of synthetic triterpenoids in various types of
cancer and leukemia cells, suggesting that cellular context is an
important variable. Several studies point to a MOA dependent on
the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (DR4/DR5/caspase-8 activation;
refs. 2, 14, 15), whereas other studies point to intrinsic apoptotic
pathway involvement (16–18). For example, in vitro experiments
using isolated mitochondria have shown that triterpenoids
depolarize these organelles at concentrations f1 to 5 Amol/L
and induce mitochondrial cytochrome c release, thereby suggesting
triterpenoids are capable of acting directly on mitochondria to

(day 1 on the graph indicates the first day of treatment)

CDDO-Me dosed p.o. twice a day (BID ) using either
an every three days or every four days schedule resulted
in statistically significant, dose-dependent inhibition of
tumor growth relative to vehicle-treated control.

initiate apoptosis (16, 19). Consistent with this line of thinking, we
have shown that overexpressing Bcl-XL in Du145 cells or knocking
out capase-9 in fibroblasts (caspase-9 / MEFs) significantly
inhibits triterpenoid-mediated killing, supporting the hypothesis
that triterpenoids mediate cell death through the intrinsic pathway.
In contrast to this theory, triterpenoids have been shown to
induce cell death in a caspase-8–dependent mechanism, i.e.,
extrinsic pathway. Examples supporting this hypothesis include
the following: (a) studies that show that a caspase-8 inhibitor
significantly reduces triterpenoid-mediated killing (12, 20, 21); (b)
a study showing that overexpression of Bcl-XL has a minimal effect
on triterpenoid-induced apoptosis (21); and (c) a study demonstrating that triterpenoids do not lead to proteolytic processing
of caspase-9 (4). In our report, we have shown that knockdown of
either DR4, DR5, or caspase-8, using siRNA molecules, significantly
reduces triterpenoid-mediated killing of prostate cancer cells, thus
supporting the hypothesis that triterpenoid killing is dependent on
the extrinsic pathway.
Altogether, the evidence suggests pleiotrophic actions of CDDO
and its analogues, with cellular context playing an important
role in dictating which particular apoptosis pathways are
dominant. In prostate cancer cells, CDDO and related compounds
seem to activate, in parallel or in an unclear collaborative way,
both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. This attribute, as well as
inhibitory effects on Akt, mammalian target of rapamycin, and
nuclear factor-nB in prostate cancers (22) argues that prostate
cancer may be a particularly attractive type of cancer for clinical
applications of these synthetic triterpenoids. Thus, triterpenoids
may retain activity even in chemorefractory prostate cancers.

Interestingly, CDDO-Me displayed a difference in its dependence
on DR4 and DR5 relative to CDDO and CDDO-Im. This observation
raises the possibility that the methyl-ester operates through an
alternative mechanism, still requiring caspase-8 but not the TRAIL
receptors. Interestingly, some reports have suggested that prostate
cancer cells express TNF family death ligands and death receptors
but are prevented from autocrine self-destruction by blocks to
death receptor signaling into the apoptotic machinery (23).
Possibly the ability of CDDO and CDDO-Im to both up-regulate
TRAIL receptors and to reduce FLIP protein levels combine to
promote caspase-8 activation and, thus, induce apoptosis via the
extrinsic pathway activation.
Emerging data from human studies with CDDO-Me have shown
great promise, with phase 1 trials continuing and phase 2 studies
recently initiated. In preclinical toxicology studies, nonhuman
primates treated with CDDO-Me p.o. once daily for 28 days at doses
of z900 mg/m2 achieved drug concentrations in the prostate of
>10 Amol/L without any toxicity.4 Our cell culture experimental
data suggest that human prostate cancer cells are sensitive to
CDDO-Me at submicromolar concentrations. This observation, in
combination with our in vivo data, showing efficacy against human
prostate cancer in a preclinical rat model, strongly suggests that
human prostate cancer should be considered as an indication for
triterpenoid therapy.
