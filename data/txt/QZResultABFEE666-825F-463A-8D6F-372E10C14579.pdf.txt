Abstract
The discovery of activating oncogenic BRAF V600E mutations
in the majority of melanomas has not yet been translated into
more effective therapy. The failure of agents may be due to
lack of sufficiently targeted therapeutics, but is more likely
based on the activation of multiple oncogenic pathways in
melanomas in addition to the mitogen-activated protein
kinase signaling pathway. In contrast, there are groups of
melanomas that instead rely on either c-KIT or CRAF signaling that may be amenable to single-agent targeted therapy.
In the current review, we discuss how knowledge about these
new melanoma subgroups may lead to improved strategies
for treating melanomas harboring BRAF V600E mutations.

Background
After decades of negative clinical trials, the new hope for
melanoma treatment is targeted therapy, using small-molecule
inhibitors directed against the oncogenic mutations responsible
for driving tumor progression. Although extensive preclinical
studies have validated the BRAF V600E mutation and the
downstream mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
as excellent therapeutic targets in the majority of melanomas
(1, 2), the initial clinical trials of inhibitors of BRAF or MAPK/
extracellular signal–regulated kinase kinase (MEK) have not yet
improved treatment for melanoma (3, 4). In part, the lack of
response may be due to the nonspecific BRAF inhibitors studied
thus far, but it is likely that even they alone will not substantially
improve outcome. The reasons for the limitations of single-agent
BRAF and MEK inhibitors in melanoma are complex. It is known
that metastatic melanomas have signaling activity in many other
pathways, such as phospho-inositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR; refs. 5, 6), which likely
provide compensatory survival signals when BRAF or MEK is
inhibited (7). There are also instances where melanomas show
amplification or overexpression of key cell cycle and survival
pathway components that may limit the effectiveness of molecularly targeted therapies (8–11). Attempts are now under way to
molecularly subgroup melanomas according to their patterns of
oncogenic mutation and signaling pathway activity, with the hope
of matching these with specific therapies. The current review
discusses two subgroups of melanomas, those that rely on c-KIT
signaling and those that rely on CRAF signaling, as a proof of

concept for melanoma targeted therapy. We suggest that a greater
understanding of these two subgroups, in which one oncogenic
event drives both proliferation and survival, can point to novel
strategies for treating BRAF V600E mutated melanomas.

Key Findings
Inhibition of c-KIT modulates both growth and survival.
Although a role for c-KIT signaling in melanoma has been long
disputed (12, 13), interest in this receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
was recently rekindled following the identification of subgroups of
melanoma harboring activating KIT mutations (14). Melanomas
that develop on body sites with little UV exposure, such as the
soles of the feet or subungual sites (acral melanomas), or on
mucous membranes (mucosal melanomas) have a very low
incidence of BRAF mutations, but often harbor activating
mutations in KIT (14–16). Within these subgroups of melanoma
there also are instances in which c-KIT is amplified in the absence
of a mutation, so that the total number of c-KIT aberrations is 39%
for mucosal, 36% for acral, and 28% for sun-damaged skin
melanomas (14). c-KIT has since been shown to be expressed in
88% of oral mucosal melanomas, with 22% of these lesions
harboring KIT mutations (16). Other studies showed that 62% of
acral and mucosal melanomas exhibited constitutive c-KIT
receptor activity, and that 15% of anal melanomas harbored
activating KIT mutations (15, 17).
Initial clinical studies on the c-KIT inhibitor imatinib in groups
of melanoma patients unselected for c-KIT status were negative
(18). The validity of c-KIT as a therapeutic target in melanoma
was recently shown by two clinical case reports, in which melanoma patients with activating mutations in c-KIT showed
remarkable responses to imatinib (19, 20). It is currently unclear
whether overexpression of c-KIT or the presence of an activating
KIT mutation predicts response to imatinib. There are cases where
high expression of c-KIT, in the absence of an activating mutation,
leads to constitutive signaling activity. We recently identified a
group of melanoma cell lines that exhibit high levels of c-KIT
receptor expression, lack KIT mutations, and respond to imatinib
in three-dimensional organotypic cell cultures and xenograft
models (21). These results were subsequently confirmed in other
melanoma cell lines harboring either an activating KIT mutation
or an SCF/c-KIT autocrine loop (15, 22). However, c-KIT receptor
expression is not always predictive of response, as shown by the
lack of imatinib response seen in melanoma cell lines that
maintained expression of c-KIT in the presence of BRAF V600E
mutation (23). In this instance, the melanoma cell lines lacked
phospho-c-KIT expression, indicating a lack of reliance of the cell
lines on c-KIT signaling for their survival. Likewise, expression of
c-KIT receptor in the absence of downstream signaling activity
was not predictive of imatinib response in a recent clinical trial of
uveal melanoma (24).

The maximal benefit of imatinib treatment is likely to be seen in
melanomas in which c-KIT activity constitutes the major signaling
node involved in survival and growth. In mucosal melanoma cell
lines harboring an activating c-KIT mutation, imatinib treatment
led to the simultaneous inhibition of the MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and
JAK/STAT signaling pathways (22). The combined suppression of
these three pathways led to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis,
associated with the down-regulation of Bcl-2, survivin, and Mcl-1
expression (21, 22). These marked imatinib-induced cytotoxic
effects are also seen in clinical studies, wherein treatment of a
c-KIT–expressing melanoma led to significant levels of apoptosis
both in the tumor and in the surrounding endothelial cells (25).
The studies on melanomas with KIT mutations suggest that
preclinical and clinical benefit can be observed when multiple
signaling pathways are simultaneously inhibited, leading to both
cytostasis and cytotoxicity.
Targeting CRAF has dual effects on proliferation and
survival. Although nearly all melanoma cell lines have constitutive
MAPK activity, it is not always mediated through BRAF signaling.
A significant group of melanomas rather have constitutive levels
of MAPK activity as a consequence of activation of the closely
related serine/threonine kinase CRAF (Raf-1; refs. 23, 26). Although
activating mutations of CRAF are virtually unknown in melanoma,
recent studies have identified at least two distinct melanoma
subgroups that rely on CRAF (23, 26, 27). Unlike BRAF, which seems
to signal exclusively through the MAPK pathway, CRAF has
multiple other downstream targets as well, such as MST-2, ASK-1,
and nuclear factor nB. In addition to localizing at the plasma
membrane, CRAF also associates with the mitochondria and
directly controls apoptosis through the regulation of phospho-BAD
and Bcl-2 (23). This interaction is likely to be significant because
high expression of Bcl-2 is known to be an important mediator of
survival in melanoma (9).
Melanomas harboring activating NRAS mutations are known to
rely on CRAF to induce MAPK pathway activity (26). In normal
melanocytes, RTK-induced activation of Ras leads to the stimulation of both BRAF and CRAF (26). Under these conditions,
activation of the MAPK pathway only proceeds via BRAF, as
constitutive protein kinase A (PKA) activity leads to the
phosphorylation and inactivation of CRAF. In melanomas with
NRAS mutations, the cyclic AMP/PKA system is deregulated, so
that PKA no longer suppresses CRAF, allowing CRAF-mediated
MAPK activation to occur (26).
Although most work to date has focused on the BRAF V600E
mutation, at least 70 other BRAF mutations have been identified
(27). Many of these show reduced BRAF kinase activity relative to
the V600E mutant form in isolated kinase assays and have been
classified as ‘‘low-activity’’ mutants. However, when low-activity
BRAF mutant proteins are transfected into COS-1 cells, they are
able to activate the MAPK pathway by directly binding to CRAF,
leading to its phosphorylation and transactivation (27). Thus, it is
likely that CRAF is a valid therapeutic target in melanomas with
low-activity BRAF mutations. A Food and Drug Administration–
approved agent with selectivity for CRAF over BRAF is the kinase
inhibitor sorafenib (28). Treatment of D594G and G469E mutant
cell lines with either sorafenib or a shRNA directed against CRAF
induced apoptosis leading to the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and
phospho-BAD expression (23). In this instance, the effects of sorafenib were found to be independent of MEK inhibition because
treatment of the low-activity mutant cell lines with the MEK
inhibitor U0126 did not affect Bcl-2/BAD expression or induce

apoptosis. Based on its roles in proliferation and apoptosis, as well as
BRAF inhibitor resistance, CRAF inhibition may prove to be a
suitable therapeutic target in subgroups of melanomas with
activating NRAS mutations, those with low-activity mutations in
BRAF, or those that become BRAF inhibitor resistant (Fig. 1; ref. 29).
The relatively low occurrence of low-activity BRAF mutant
melanomas in the general patient population has made clinical
testing for them difficult. Thus, the essentially negative phase II
trials with single-agent sorafenib in unselected melanoma patients
failed to address the potential value of this agent in low-activity
BRAF mutant tumors (3). Clearly, further clinical evaluation of
sorafenib in patients presenting with low-activity BRAF mutations
is warranted.
Current status of therapy for BRAF V600E mutated
melanomas. As a proof of concept of the importance of matching the appropriate targeted therapy with genetic subgroup, singleagent trials with c-KIT inhibitors in c-KIT–dependent melanomas
and sorafenib (as a CRAF inhibitor) in low-activity BRAF mutant
melanomas are now under way. However, these two subgroups
may account for no more than 5% of advanced melanomas. For the
vast majority of patients, strategies will need to be defined for
melanomas harboring either NRAS or BRAF V600E mutations.
BRAF V600E mutated tumors make up the single largest
subgroup of defined melanomas, and have been the subject of
intensive preclinical and clinical study by our group and others.
These tumors are also likely to be the most genetically diverse,
with subgroups of BRAF V600E mutated melanomas being
identified with alterations in PTEN, cyclin D1, CDK2, CDK4, MITF,
and AKT3 (8, 10, 11, 30, 31). In the phase II trial investigating a
selective MEK inhibitor (AZD6244) among patients with metastatic melanoma harboring V600E mutations, 12% of patients
experienced significant, but incomplete, regression (4). This
relatively modest activity is likely a consequence of compensatory
activity from other intracellular signaling pathways and is consistent with preclinical data showing that BRAF/MEK inhibition
is mostly cytostatic in V600E-mutated melanoma cells (32–34).
It remains to be determined if selective BRAF inhibitors will only
be active in a restricted subgroup of melanomas, as we are still
conducting dose escalation trials with the first two selective
BRAF inhibitors (RAF-265 and PLX4032). Melanomas with BRAF
V600E mutations, which are unresponsive to BRAF/MEK inhibitors, may be sensitive to dual inhibition of the MAPK/PI3K pathways, or the MAPK/mTOR pathways, as has been shown preclinically (35–37). It is likely that the combined inhibition of these
pathways will lead to the desired dual cytotoxic and cytostatic
activity, similar to that observed when KIT-dependent melanomas
are treated with imatinib or CRAF-dependent melanomas are treated
with sorafenib. Beyond rapamycin-analogue mTOR inhibitors, potent
and selective PI3K and AKT inhibitors are just now emerging from
single-agent phase I trials. The availability of these drugs sets the
stage for rigorous clinical testing of this hypothesis.
To maximize the probability of success, future targeted therapy
trials must be conducted in patient populations prospectively
analyzed for the presence of the relevant somatic genetic changes.
With this new paradigm established, we are at the threshold of a
new era of therapeutic discovery for melanoma.

Conclusion
While trials using targeted BRAF inhibitors are currently under
way, single-agent BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatments are unlikely

Melanoma Targeted Therapy

Figure 1. Effective targeted therapies require dual cytostatic and cytotoxic effects. Preclinical studies have shown that whereas BRAF/MEK inhibition leads to a
reversible cell cycle arrest in melanoma cell lines with BRAF V600E mutations, inhibition of CRAF and c-KIT activity in defined melanoma subgroups leads to both
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

to lead to long-term clinical responses. There is already preclinical evidence of emerging resistance to BRAF inhibitors following prolonged treatment (29). Efforts are ongoing to determine
the optimal combination of signaling pathways to target in
melanoma to induce both growth arrest and cell death. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that the selection of the correct molecular target, such as CRAF or c-KIT, in defined molecular subgroups of melanomas can lead to the desired cytotoxic effects.
