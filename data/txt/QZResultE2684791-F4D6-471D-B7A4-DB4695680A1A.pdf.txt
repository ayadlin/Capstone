Abstract
Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are effective in
inducing remissions in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
patients but do not eliminate primitive CML hematopoietic
cells. There is a need to identify mechanisms that contribute
to retention of CML progenitors. Src family tyrosine kinases
have been identified as potential mediators of Bcr-Abl–
induced leukemogenesis. Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is a potent
dual Abl/Src kinase inhibitor approved for clinical use in CML
patients. We evaluated Src activity in primitive human CML
progenitors from different stages of disease and investigated
effects of Dasatinib on Src activity and downstream signaling
pathways. P-Src expression was increased in CD34+ cells and
CD34+CD38 cells in all phases of CML. Dasatinib showed
potent Src inhibitory activity in CML progenitors, inhibiting
both Bcr-Abl–dependent and –independent Src activity. In
contrast, Imatinib inhibited only Bcr-Abl–dependent Src
activity. Dasatinib inhibited P–mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK), P-Akt, and P-STAT5 levels in CML progenitors
in the absence of growth factors but not in the presence of
growth factors. A marked increase in P-MAPK levels seen in
the presence of growth factors with Imatinib was much less
prominent with Dasatinib. Dasatinib significantly suppressed
CML colony-forming cells and long-term culture-initiating
cells but did not significantly alter the level of apoptosisregulating proteins in CML CD34+ cells. Our results indicate
that Dasatinib, in addition to potent anti–Bcr-Abl kinase
activity, effectively inhibits Src kinase activity and downstream signaling pathways in CML progenitors but does not
induce a strong proapoptotic response. These observations
argue against a prominent role for Src kinases in persistence
of primitive CML cells in TKI-treated patients. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and the resulting BCR-ABL
fusion gene represent the pathogenetic hallmark of chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML). The deregulated tyrosine kinase
activity of the Bcr-Abl protein alters cellular homeostatic
mechanisms in primitive hematopoietic cells, resulting in increased

proliferation, decreased apoptosis, and disturbed interaction with
the extracellular matrix. The natural course of CML is an inevitable
progression from an initial chronic phase (CP) to an accelerated
phase (AP) and a fatal blast crisis (BC). Treatment with Imatinib
mesylate (Imatinib), results in remarkably improved outcomes for
CML patients. The majority of CP CML patients receiving Imatinib
achieves and maintains major cytogenetic responses and substantial molecular responses (1, 2). However, it is also known that
primitive CML hematopoietic cells escape elimination by Imatinib
and that discontinuation of drug results in disease relapse (3).
Previous studies suggest that effective inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase
activity by different tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is not sufficient
to induce apoptosis in CML progenitors (4–7). These results
indicate the importance of identifying the intracellular signaling
mechanisms that are responsible for retention of CML progenitors
despite Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition, and that could be targeted to
enhance elimination of CML progenitor cells.
The Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases have been
identified as potential mediators of Bcr-Abl–induced leukemogenesis (8–10). Overexpression of Src family kinases has been
implicated in Imatinib resistance and CML progression (11–13).
Imatinib does not inhibit Src activity in mouse leukemic cells,
suggesting that Src activation may also occur independently of BcrAbl kinase activity (14–16). Dasatinib (BMS-354825), a highly potent
dual Abl/Src kinase inhibitor, which is active against most Imatinibresistant mutants, has been approved for clinical use in CML
patients who fail Imatinib (17–19). Dasatinib inhibits wild-type BcrAbl and all members of the Src family, with an IC50 of <1 nmol/L
(20, 21). However, it is not clear from previous studies whether Src
kinase activity is elevated in primary progenitors from CML patients.
In addition, the effects of Dasatinib on Src kinase activity in primary
CML progenitor cells and on downstream signaling activities and
apoptosis-regulating mechanisms have not been studied. In this
study, we evaluated Src activity in primitive human CML progenitors
from different stages of disease and investigated the effects of
Dasatinib on Bcr-Abl and Src kinase activity and downstream
growth signaling pathways in CP CML progenitors.

Effects of Dasatinib on Signaling in CML Progenitors

Inhibitors
Ten–micromole per liter stock solutions of Dasatinib (Bristol-Myers
Squibb) and Imatinib (Novartis Pharmaceuticals) were prepared in DMSO
and stored at 20jC. Dasatinib was added to cell cultures at concentrations
ranging between 0.01 and 0.15 Amol/L, and Imatinib was added at a
concentration of 5 Amol/L, corresponding to plasma concentrations in
patients receiving these agents (18, 22).

Selection of CD34+ Progenitors
Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma Diagnostics)
density gradient centrifugation (specific gravity, 1.077) for 30 min at 400 g.
CD34+ cells were selected by means of immunomagnetic column separation
(Miltenyi Biotech) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell Culture and Exposure to Inhibitors
CD34+, CD34+CD38 , or CD34+CD38+ cells were cultured with or without
addition of Dasatinib or Imatinib at the indicated concentrations at 37jC
in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in serum-free medium (SFEM;
StemCell Technologies) supplemented with growth factors (GF) at concentrations similar to that found in stroma-conditioned medium from longterm bone marrow cultures [LTBMC; 200 pg/mL granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (CSF); 1 ng/mL G-CSF; 200 pg/mL stem cell
factor; 50 pg/mL leukemia inhibitory factor; 200 pg/mL macrophageinflammatory protein-1a; and 1 ng/mL interleukin 6]. Cells were harvested
after 96 h and assayed in progenitor, proliferation, and apoptosis assays.

Progenitor Assays
Colony-forming cells. To assess committed progenitors, CD34+ cells
were plated in methylcellulose progenitor culture, and burst forming uniterythroid and colony-forming unit-granulocyte and macrophage were
counted after 14 d.
Long-term culture-initiating cells. To assess primitive progenitors,
CD34+ cells were plated in LTBMC medium on M2-10B4 murine fibroblast
feeders subcultured in 96-well plates. Cultures were maintained at 37jC in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and fed at weekly intervals. After 6 wk,
wells were overlaid with colony forming cells (CFC) growth–supporting
medium and scored as positive or negative for the presence of CFC after 2
wk. The frequency of long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) was
calculated with L-Calc software (StemCell Technologies). Results from the
CFC and LTC-IC were reported as percentage of growth inhibition versus
control.

Flow Cytometry
CD34+CD38+ and CD34+CD38 progenitor cells were labeled with 5- (and
6-) carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Molecular
Probes) as described previously (7). CFSE-labeled cells were cultured for
96 h in the presence or absence of inhibitors. At the end of the culture
period, cells were labeled with Annexin V-PE (BD Pharmingen). Cell division
was analyzed on the basis of CFSE fluorescence measured by flow
cytometry (FACScalibur; Becton Dickinson). The percentage of cells in
different generations was enumerated and a proliferation index was
generated using ModFit software (Verity). Apoptotic cells were defined as
Annexin V-PE+. Intracellular phospho-Src (P-Src Alexa-Fluor 488; Upstate)
and phospho-Crk-like (P-CrkL; Cell Signalling) staining were performed and
analyzed by flow cytometry using methods described previously (14).

Western Blot Analysis
CD34+ cells were cultured in medium containing low concentrations of
GFs, with or without inhibitors, for 16 h. Cells were lysed in buffer
containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma Diagnostics) and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mmol/L),
protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mmol/L Sodium
Fluoride, 1 mmol/L Sodium Vanadate; all from Sigma Diagnostics). Proteins
were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane. Membranes were sequentially reprobed with primary and
secondary antibodies. Primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-CrkL
rabbit polyclonal antibody (sc-319), anti-Phosphotyrosine mouse monoclo-

nal antibody (mAb; 4G10; Millipore) anti-phosphorylated p42/44 mitogenactivated protein kinase (P-MAPK) mouse mAb (sc-7383), anti-p42/44
MAPK rabbit polyclonal antibody (sc-94), anti-STAT5 rabbit polyclonal
antibody (sc-835), anti–Bcl-2 (100) mouse mAb (sc-509), anti–Mcl-1 (S-19)
rabbit polyclonal antibody (sc-819; all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), antiphosphorylated STAT5 (P-STAT5; Tyr694) rabbit polyclonal antibody, antiphosphorylated Akt (P-Akt; Ser473) rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-Akt
rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-phosphorylated Src Family (Tyr416) rabbit
polyclonal antibody and anti-Src rabbit polyclonal antibody (all from Cell
Signaling Technology), anti-actin mouse mAb (clone AC-15), anti-Bim
(BOD) rabbit polyclonal antibody (all from Sigma), and anti–Bcl-XL rabbit
polyclonal antibody (BD Biosciences). Horseradish peroxidase– or alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Antibody detection was performed using the
Superfemto kit (Pierce Biotechnology). The protein expression levels were
determined by densitometry using Image-Quant software (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech).

Fluorescent In situ Hybridization Analysis
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed as
previously described (23). Colonies from CFC assays were harvested, pooled,
and washed. Cells were resuspended in hypotonic KCl solution, centrifuged,
and fixed using Carnoy fixative. Hybridization using the LSI dual-labeled
Bcr-Abl DNA probe was performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions (Vysis). Lymphocytes from a healthy individual served as a BcrAbl negative control; SD-1 cell lines, derived from an acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) patient, served as a Bcr-Abl positive control. A total of
200 nuclei were scored for each sample.

Statistical Analysis
Data obtained from independent experiments were reported as the mean
F SE. Student’s t test analysis was performed to determine statistical
significance.

Results
Src phosphorylation is enhanced in primitive and committed progenitor cells from CML patients. P-Src expression was
assessed in CD34+ and more primitive CD34+CD38 CML cells from
patients with CP, AP, and BC CML and compared with normal CD34+
cells using intracellular antibody labeling and flow cytometry
(Fig. 1A–D). A P-Src antibody capable of measuring phosphorylation
status on the same tyrosine residue (Tyr416) of all members of the
Src kinase family was used. Although there was considerable
interpatient variability in expression of P-Src, CML CP and BC CD34+
cells showed significantly increased levels of P-Src compared with
normal CD34+ cells (P = 0.02 and 0.022, respectively; Fig. 1A and C).
As with total CD34+ cells, CML CP and BC CD34+CD38 cells also
showed significantly increased levels of P-Src (P = 0.032 and 0.013,
respectively; Fig. 1B) compared with normal CD34+CD38 cells.
There was again a trend toward higher P-Src levels in the BC
compared with CP samples. There was also a trend toward higher
P-Src levels in total CD34+ cells compared with CD34+CD38 cells
(Fig. 1D). These results indicate that P-Src expression is increased
in CD34+ cells and CD34+CD38 cells in all phases of CML.
Dasatinib effectively inhibits Src and Bcr-Abl kinase activity
in CML primitive and committed progenitor cells. The effects
of Dasatinib and Imatinib on Src and Bcr-Abl kinase activity were
assessed after 16 hours of exposure in culture. On assessment by
intracellular flow cytometry, Dasatinib significantly reduced P-Src
expression in both CML CD34+ (P < 0.001) and more primitive CML
CD34+CD38 cells (P < 0.001) compared with no drug controls
(Fig. 2A). Imatinib also inhibited P-Src expression in CML CD34+
(P < 0.001) and CD34+CD38 cells (P = 0.003) but to a lesser extent

than Dasatinib. We also assessed P-Src levels by performing
Western blot analysis for P-Src on protein extracts from CD34+ cells
treated with Dasatinib and Imatinib. As was seen with flow cytometry assays, Western blot analysis also indicated that P-Src
levels were effectively suppressed in response to Dasatinib
(0.01–0.15 Amol/L) treatment (P < 0.001; Fig. 2B). P-Src levels were
only partially suppressed after treatment with Imatinib (5 Amol/L;
P = 0.06). To study the effect of Dasatinib on Bcr-Abl kinase activity,
we performed Western blotting for P-CrkL, which can be
distinguished from nonphosphorylated CrkL by its slower migration on Western blots. As shown in Fig. 2C, treatment with
Dasatinib at doses as low as 0.01 Amol/L effectively suppressed
P-CrkL protein levels (P < 0.001). Increasing the Dasatinib
concentration to 0.15 Amol/L resulted in further suppression of
P-CrkL levels. P-CrkL levels were also suppressed after treatment
with 5 Amol/L Imatinib (P < 0.001). We also preformed Western
blotting for phosphorylated Bcr-Abl and Abl (Fig. 2D). Membranes
were sequentially probed with anti-Phosphotyrosine and anti-Abl
antibodies to detect phosphorylated and total Bcr-Abl. Potent
inhibition of Bcr-Abl phosphorylation was observed, consistent
with the results of anti-CrkL blotting.
Dasatinib inhibits MAPK, Akt, and STAT5 phosphorylation
in CML progenitors in the absence of GFs, but phosphorylation is maintained in the presence of GFs. The MAPK, Akt, and
STAT5 signaling pathways are activated downstream of Bcr-Abl and
may contribute to abnormal proliferation and survival of CML
progenitors. We assessed the activity of these signaling pathways in

CML CD34+ cells after 16 hours of exposure to Imatinib (5 Amol/L)
and Dasatinib (0.01–0.15 Amol/L) with or without exogenous GF.
Consistent with our previous observations, treatment with Imatinib,
in the presence of GF, resulted in increased MAPK activity in CML
CD34+ cells (31.4- F 14.4-fold; n = 4). Increased MAPK activity was
less prominent with Dasatinib treatment than with Imatinib
treatment and was only seen at the highest concentrations of Dasatinib (7.6- F 4.0-fold at 0.15 Amol/L Dasatinib; Fig. 3A). Incubation of
CML CD34+ cells with Dasatinib in the presence of GF did not lead
to a significant change in P-Akt and P-STAT levels in CML CD34+
cells (Fig. 3B and C). Similar results were obtained with Imatinib.
GF receptor engagement may also contribute to signaling
through the MAPK, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI-3K)/Akt
and STAT5 pathways. Dasatinib exposure in the presence or
absence of GF stimulation resulted in similar inhibition of P-CrkL.
However, inhibition of P-Src in response to low levels of Dasatinib
(0.01 Am) was enhanced in the absence of GF. Similarly, Imatinib
effectively inhibited Src signaling in the absence of GF but resulted
in partial inhibition of P-Src levels in the presence of GF. These
results suggest a role for GF stimulation in residual Src signaling in
cells exposed to low levels of Dasatinib and to Imatinib. Exposure
to Dasatinib in the absence of GF resulted in complete inhibition of
P-STAT5 and reduction in P-MAPK, P-Akt, and P-STAT5 levels
(Fig. 4A). Similar effects were seen with Imatinib. Because signaling
in the absence of GF is likely to be mainly Bcr-Abl driven, these
results suggest that Dasatinib effectively inhibits Bcr-Abl–mediated
activation of the MAPK, PI-3K, and STAT5 pathways. In contrast,

Figure 2. Effects of Imatinib and Dasatinib on P-Src and P-CrkL expression in CML CD34+ and CD34+CD38 cells. The effect of Imatinib and Dasatinib on P-Src expression
was assessed by flow cytometry in total CD34+ (left) and more primitive CD34+38 (right) CML cells at 16 and 72 h (n = 6; 4 CP, 2 BC; A). Results are expressed as a percentage
of the no drug control (FSE). There was no difference between CP and BC CML in the samples assessed. The effect of inhibitors on P-Src, total Src, and Actin was also assessed
by Western blotting (B). A representative blot for one CML sample is shown. Expression of P-Src (P-Src/actin ratio) after inhibitor treatment expressed as a percentage of
P-Src expression in the absence of inhibitors is shown; columns, mean of three replicate experiments; bars, SE. Significant differences in protein expression levels for treated
cells compared with untreated controls are indicated for Dasatinib (***, P < 0.001; **, P < 0.01). To assess the effect of Dasatinib or Imatinib on Bcr-Abl kinase activity, Western
blotting was performed using anti-CrkL antibodies (C). Representative blots for one CML sample are shown. P-CrkL (P-CrkL/total CrkL ratio) expressed as percentage of
P-CrkL in the absence of inhibitors is shown; columns, mean (n = 5); bars, SE. Significant differences in protein expression levels for treated cells compared with untreated
controls are indicated for Imatinib (+++, P < 0.001) and Dasatinib (***, P < 0.001). The effect of Dasatinib or Imatinib on Bcr-Abl kinase activity was also assessed by Western
blotting for phosphorylated Bcr-Abl with anti-Phosphotyrosine and total BCR-ABL with anti-ABL antibodies. Potent inhibition of Bcr-Abl phosphorylation was observed (D).

cells. CML CD34+ cells were incubated

the Materials and Methods. Cell lysates
were prepared and Western blotting

The results shown are representative of
n = 4 to 5 experiments using different CML
patient samples.

the additional Src inhibition by Dasatinib does not further inhibit
signaling through the MAPK, PI-3K, and STAT5 pathways in cells
exposed to GF.
Dasatinib treatment does not alter apoptosis-regulating
proteins and has only modest effects on CML progenitor cell
apoptosis in the presence of GFs but has significant
antiproliferative effects. CML, cord blood, and normal PBSC
CD34+ cells were cultured for 96 hours in low GF conditions with or
without Dasatanib or Imatinib, and the number of CFC (committed
progenitors) and LTC-IC (primitive progenitors) present after
culture was assessed. Dasatinib resulted in dose-dependent
suppression of CML LTC-IC compared with untreated controls
(P = 0.0008; Fig. 5A). Dasatinib treatment also resulted in a
significant, dose-dependent suppression of CML CFC (P = 0.0001;
Fig. 5A). Suppression of CML CFC and LTC-IC by Dasatinib was
comparable with that observed with 5 Amol/L Imatinib treatment
(P = 0.0002 and 0.001, respectively). We have shown that Imatinib
shows higher potency of inhibition of CML CFC compared with
LTC-IC (7). Results shown in Fig. 5A indicate that Dasatinib
similarly inhibits CML CFC more effectively than LTC-IC at low
concentrations (0.01 Amol/L). This is consistent with a greater effect
of these inhibitors on committed compared with primitive
progenitors. FISH analysis of colonies generated in CFC culture
revealed that 98.3% F 0.4% (n = 4) of cells derived from CFC
from untreated cells were BCR-ABL positive. CFC remaining after
Dasatinib or Imatinib treatment were also predominantly BCR-ABL
positive (0.15 Amol/L Dasatinib: 84.8% F 12.7%, n = 3; 5 Amol/L
Imatinib: 94.8% F 4.3%, n = 4), indicating persistence of BCR-ABL–
positive cells. Dasatinib treatment suppressed cord blood LTC-IC
and CFC to a lesser extent than CML progenitors (Fig. 5B).
Dasatinib also inhibited normal PBSC CFC to a lesser extent than
CML CFC (Fig. 5C).
To assess the effects of Dasatinib on apoptosis, CML CD34+38
and CD34+38+ cells were selected using flow cytometry and

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (23). December 1, 2008

incubated with Dasatinib or Imatinib under low GF conditions for
96 hours and then labeled with Annexin V-PE and analyzed by flow
cytometry for apoptosis (Annexin V–positive cells; Fig. 6A and B).
Treatment with Dasatinib resulted in only a modest increase in
apoptosis of CML primitive and committed progenitors. Similar
results were seen after Imatinib treatment. Treatment of cord blood
and normal PBSC CD34+CD38 and CD34+CD38+ cells with
Dasatinib or Imatinib did not result in significant increase in
apoptosis in the tested dose range (Fig. 6A and B). We also evaluated
the effect of Dasatinib treatment on the expression of proteins
known to be important in regulating apoptosis and reported to be
regulated by Bcr-Abl, including the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1,
Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL and the proapoptotic protein Bim. Treatment with
Dasatinib in the presence of GF did not result in alteration in the
expression of Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bim after adjusting for protein
loading based on actin (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that
maintenance of signaling through the GF-receptors is sufficient to
prevent alterations in these apoptosis regulatory mechanisms after
Dasatinib treatment.
The effect of Dasatinib on cell division was evaluated by labeling
CML and normal CD34+CD38+ committed and CD34+CD38
primitive progenitors with CFSE before culture and tracking cell
division using flow cytometry. Treatment with Dasatinib or Imatinib
resulted in a significant inhibition of CML CD34+CD38 and
CD34+CD38+ progenitor growth (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Dasatinib
also inhibited proliferation of cord blood primitive progenitors
(Supplementary Fig. S1B) and normal PBSC primitive and committed progenitors (Supplementary Fig. S1C) but to a lesser extent than
CML progenitors. An increased proportion of undivided progenitors
were seen after Dasatinib treatment, as has been previously
described for Imatinib (Supplementary Fig S1D; refs. 14, 24). Annexin
V labeling indicated that apoptosis was largely restricted to dividing
cells and that nondividing CML progenitors were resistant to
apoptosis after Dasatinib and Imatinib treatment (Fig. 6D).

Effects of Dasatinib on Signaling in CML Progenitors

Discussion
Imatinib treatment has been shown to be highly effective in all
phases of CML with most patients achieving substantial and
prolonged reduction in levels of Bcr-Abl–positive cells. However,
low levels of residual Bcr-Abl expressing stem and progenitor cells
can be detected in most CML patients in remission on Imatinib
(25). Imatinib does not effectively induce apoptosis in primitive
CML progenitors, despite inhibiting Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity
in these cells (5, 14). The mechanisms that contribute to

preservation of CML progenitors in patients receiving Bcr-Abl
TKI treatment are unclear because previous studies indicate that
Imatinib and other TKI can effectively inhibit Bcr-Abl kinase
activity in CD34+ cells. Here, we evaluated Src kinase activity and
the effect of blocking Src signaling with Dasatinib on primitive
human CML progenitors.
Our studies show that human CML stem and progenitor cells
display increased Src kinase activity. Although studies in myeloid
cell lines have shown that Bcr-Abl can directly and indirectly

Figure 4. Effects of Dasatinib on cell signaling pathways in CML CD34+ cells in the absence of GFs. CML CD34+ cells were incubated with Dasatinib or Imatinib for
16 h in SFEM without addition of GF, followed by preparation of cell lysates and Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. The results shown are representative
of two experiments using different CML patient samples (A). The effect of Imatinib and Dasatinib on Bcr-Abl and Src signaling is illustrated in B . Bcr-Abl and GF
receptors both signal through the MAPK, PI-3K/Akt, and STAT5 pathways through Src-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In addition, BCR-ABL–transformed
cells and primary CML progenitors show enhanced autocrine secretion of GF (dashed line ). Imatinib-mediated inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase activity results in reduced
downstream signaling through Src-dependent and Src-independent mechanisms in addition to inhibition of Bcr-Abl–mediated autocrine GF signaling. However, Src
signaling through GF receptor engagement and other Bcr-Abl–independent mechanisms is not affected. Dasatinib in addition to inhibiting Bcr-Abl kinase–dependent
signaling such as Imatinib also inhibits Bcr-Abl–independent Src signaling. Although the additional Src inhibition leads to reduced elevation of P-MAPK levels in
response to exogenous GF, Src-independent GF-activated signals can persist in Dasatinib-treated cells.

interact with and activate Src family kinases (10), previous studies
have not directly evaluated Src kinase expression and activity in
primary CML cells. Other studies have shown that Bcr-Abl
retrovirus–transduced marrow from mice lacking Src kinases
efficiently induced CML but not B-ALL in transplant recipients,
and Src kinase inhibitors prolonged survival of mice with B-ALL
but not with CML (26). These studies suggested an important role
for Src in Ph+ALL, whereas its activity and role in CML is less clear.
We show here that levels of P-Src are significantly increased in
CD34+ and CD34+CD38 cells from patients with CP CML.
Increased Src activity was associated with disease progression with
a trend toward increased P-Src in cells from patients with BC
compared with CP CML. Interestingly, P-Src levels were higher in
CD34+ cells compared with CD34+CD38 cells, indicating
maturation stage–related changes in Src activity. We further show
that Imatinib treatment only partially inhibited P-Src levels in CML
progenitors, whereas Dasatinib potently inhibited Src kinase

activity under these conditions. These studies were conducted in
cells exposed to exogenous GF. Because Src kinases can be
activated by signaling from GF receptors, we also studied the
effects of inhibitors in the absence of GF. Dasatinib and Imatinib
were both highly effective in inhibiting Src signaling in the absence
of GF, suggesting that incomplete inhibition of Src in CML cells
exposed to exogenous GF may be related to GF receptor–mediated
activation of Src. These results indicate that both Bcr-Abl and non–
Bcr-Abl kinase–dependent mechanisms contribute to Src activation in CML progenitor cells and that whereas Imatinib only
inhibits Bcr-Abl kinase mediated Src activation, both Bcr-Abl
kinase-dependent and kinase-independent Src activation are
inhibited by Dasatinib. These observations help clarify the
relationship of Bcr-Abl kinase Src activity in human CML
progenitors.
Our studies elucidate the relative contribution of Src and Bcr-Abl
kinases to the activity of important downstream signaling

Effects of Dasatinib on Signaling in CML Progenitors

Figure 6. Effect of Dasatinib on apoptosis in CML primitive and committed progenitors. CML CD34+CD38 primitive and CD34+CD38+ committed progenitors
were exposed to Dasatinib or Imatinib at indicated concentrations for 96 h. Apoptosis was analyzed by FACS after Annexin V-PE labeling. The percentage of
apoptotic cells is shown as columns for each concentration of Dasatinib or Imatinib. Columns, mean values for apoptosis of CML (n = 5), cord blood (n = 3), and
normal PBSC (n = 3) primitive progenitors (A) and CML, cord blood, and normal PBSC committed progenitors (B ); bars, SE. Significant increase in apoptosis in
response to Imatinib (c, P < 0.05) is indicated. CML CD34+ cells were exposed to Dasatinib or Imatinib at indicated concentrations for 16 h. C , Western blotting for
apoptosis-regulating proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bim) and actin expression was performed. The results shown are representative of two experiments using
different CML patient samples. Representative FACS dot plot for CFSE and Annexin V labeling of CML CD34+CD38+ cells, demonstrating restriction of apoptosis

pathways in CML progenitors. Src kinases are known to play an
important role in regulating mitotic events and, such as the BcrAbl kinase, can activate the STAT5, PI-3K/Akt, and MAPK signaling
pathways (27, 28). We show here that exposure to Dasatinib in the
absence of GF resulted in almost complete suppression of P-STAT5
expression and reduced P-MAPK and P-Akt expression. However,
Imatinib resulted in similar suppression of P-STAT, P-Akt, and
P-MAPK, suggesting that combined inhibition of Src and Bcr-Abl
kinase activity did not result in increased suppression of these
signaling pathways. Although GF signaling from autocrine
mechanisms has been observed in primitive CML cells even in
the absence of exogenous GF (29), autocrine GF production and
signaling is Bcr-Abl kinase dependent and rapidly inhibited with
Imatinib treatment (30). On the other hand, treatment with
Dasatinib in the presence of GF did not inhibit P-STAT5 or P-Akt
expression in CML CD34+ cells. This indicates that inhibition of Src
activity did not suppress GF-activated signaling through these
pathways. In contrast, a dose-dependent increase in MAPK activity
observed in CD34+ progenitor cells treated with Imatinib in the
presence of GF was much less apparent after Dasatinib treatment,
suggesting that Src signaling may contribute to increased MAPK
activity under these conditions.
Importantly, inhibition of Src signaling in combination with BcrAbl kinase inhibition by Dasatinib did not induce proapoptotic
signals in CML progenitors. This is consistent with our previous
and current observations that primitive CML CP cells are resistant
to induction of apoptosis with Dasatinib (4, 14). Primitive leukemic
cells from mice with Bcr-Abl retrovirus–induced B-ALL and CML
have also been shown to be insensitive to both Imatinib and
Dasatinib treatment (31). These observations suggest that combined Src and Bcr-Abl kinase inhibition does not enhance targeting
of primitive progenitors from CP CML patients. It remains possible
that Src inhibition may have a role in advanced phase or Imatinibresistant CML. Overexpression of Src family kinases has been implicated in Imatinib resistance and CML progression, and short
interfering RNA targeting the Src kinase Lyn can induce apoptosis in
CML BC cells (11, 13). An adaptive increase in GF production and
Jak2 signaling may contribute to Imatinib resistance, and inhibition
of Src signaling may also be beneficial in this context (28, 32).
Dasatinib significantly suppressed CML primitive and committed
progenitor cells in LTC-IC and CFC assays. Dasatinib also significantly reduced the number of dividing cells observed on CFSE
tracking experiments. These observations, together with the lack of
apoptosis in undivided cells, suggest that Dasatinib suppresses
progenitor growth through inhibition of proliferation and a modest
increase in apoptosis in dividing progenitors. These effects are very
similar to those of Imatinib and again indicate that additional Src
inhibition by Dasatinib did not enhance suppression and targeting
of CML primitive and committed progenitors. The effects of
Dasatinib treatment are similar to those obtained with another
dual Bcr-Abl and Src inhibitor, SKI-606. Although less potent than
Dasatinib, active concentrations of SKI-606 that effectively inhibit

Bcr-Abl and Src kinase activity have similar effects on CML
progenitor apoptosis, proliferation, and growth in CFC and LTC-IC
assays, with relatively little effect on normal progenitors (6).
In conclusion, our results indicate that Src kinase activity is
enhanced in CML progenitor cells and that Dasatinib, although
highly effective in inhibiting Src and Bcr-Abl kinase activity in CML
progenitor cells, does not show enhanced suppression of important
downstream signaling mechanisms compared with Imatinib. The
enhanced Src inhibiting activity of Dasatinib does not significantly
alter apoptosis regulating proteins in CML progenitors. Although
our results indicate that Imatinib and Dasatinib effectively inhibit
BCR/ABL kinase activity in primitive CML cell populations, it is
important to also consider that there may be considerable heterogeneity in BCR-ABL expression, drug uptake and efflux, and the
presence of additional genetic abnormalities within the purified
populations studied. Persistence of small populations of malignant
stem and progenitor cells despite inhibitor treatment could allow
accumulation of additional genetic aberrations leading to drug
resistance or evolution to BC. Indeed, we have shown that BCR-ABL
kinase mutations can be detected in CD34+ cells from CML patients
in CCR on Imatinib, may contribute to persistence of small
populations of malignant progenitors, and could be a potential
source of relapse or progression (25). Although we cannot exclude
the possibility that Bcr-Abl and Src kinase activated is not inhibited
in a small subset of CML cells that are not detectable using the assays
used here, the lack of apoptosis in the bulk of CML progenitors after
TKI treatment cannot be explained by lack of inhibition of Bcr-Abl
and Src kinase activity. Therefore, the use of more potent Abl kinase
inhibitors or dual Src-Abl kinase inhibitors may not by itself to
enhance targeting of residual CML progenitors, and other pathways
for CML stem and progenitor cell survival need to be identified and
targeted to enhance their elimination. In this respect, our recent
observations that farnesyl transferase inhibitors and histone
deacetylase inhibitors (33, 34) are capable of effectively inducing
apoptosis in quiescent CML primitive progenitors indicate promising areas for further investigation.
