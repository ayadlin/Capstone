BACKGROUND: Belotecan (CKD602; Camtobell, Chong Keun Dang Corp., Seoul, Korea) is a recently developed
camptothecin derivative with antitumor properties. This phase II study was designed to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of belotecan combined with carboplatin in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). METHODS:
Thirty-eight patients with recurrent EOC were treated with belotecan 0.3 mg/m2/day (days 1-5) and carboplatin AUC
5 (day 5) every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. The primary objective was to determine the response rate as defined by
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and CA-125 response. Other end points included toxicities and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: All 38 patients were assessed for toxicity, and 35 patients were assessed for
response. The overall response rate was 57.1%; there were 7 complete responses (20.0%), 13 partial responses (37.1%),
6 patients with stable disease (17.1%), and 9 patients with progressive disease (25.7%). Grades 3 and 4 hematologic
toxicities included neutropenia (28.8%), thrombocytopenia (19.8%), and anemia (14.4%), and there were 2 episodes of
febrile neutropenia. Median PFS was 7 months, with a median follow-up of 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The newly
developed topoisomerase I inhibitor belotecan (CKD-602) combined with carboplatin is a well-tolerated regimen
with activity in recurrent EOC. Further testing of this regimen is warranted to further characterize efficacy and indicaC 2010 American Cancer Society.

KEYWORDS: belotecan, carboplatin, recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most fatal gynecologic malignancy. Although the majority of patients respond
to first-line platinum- and taxane-based therapy, the disease usually recurs after a disease-free survival of a few months to
years.1 However, there is no agreement on the best second-line treatment for recurrent disease. The efficacy of several
agents that have been used for this application, including retreatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin, as well as treatment
with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, docetaxel, or gemcitabine, appears to be similar, yielding a response rate between
10% and 30%.2-7 Thus, it is very important to develop new, effective, and non-cross-resistant agents with novel
mechanisms of action for use as salvage therapy in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.
Topoisomerase I inhibitors, including camptothecin, constitute a class of compounds with a novel mechanism of
action. Topotecan, a water-soluble semisynthetic analogue of the alkaloid camptothecin, has undergone extensive testing
to define its role as a second-line agent for recurrent EOC and has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration
for that indication.8,9
Belotecan (Camtobell; CKD602, 7-[2(N-isopropylamino) ethyl]-(20S)-camptothecin; Chong Kun Dang Corp,
Seoul, Korea) is a new camptothecin analogue in which a water-solubilizing group is introduced at position 7 of the B ring
of camptothecin.10-12 In preclinical studies, belotecan had more potent topoisomerase I–inhibiting activity than does
topotecan while simultaneously overcoming the poor water solubility and toxicity of its parent drug.13 Belotecan, alone or
in combination with cisplatin, has demonstrated promising outcomes in some cancers.14-17 In recurrent ovarian cancer,
use of belotecan as a single agent resulted in a 21%-45% response rate, and using it in combination with cisplatin showed
a 47%-69% response rate with acceptable toxicity.18-20

Belotecan and Carboplatin in Ovarian CA/Choi et al

Despite these results, there have been no reports
on the efficacy of combination treatments, including belotecan and carboplatin. Compared with cisplatin, carboplatin is equivalent in efficacy, with a substantially
superior adverse effect profile, particularly a lower risk of
severe emesis, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity.21-24
Cumulative neurotoxicity is one of the most important
toxicities, requiring a better therapeutic index in patients
with relapsed ovarian cancer. In addition, the well-recognized dose-limiting hematological toxicity of carboplatin
is easier to manage (eg, dose reduction, use of bone marrow colony-stimulating factors) than are the adverse
effects associated with cisplatin. So, there is an obvious
interest in the potential to combine belotecan with
carboplatin, and we have performed this study to evaluate
the efficacy and toxicities of belotecan combined with
carboplatin in patients with recurrent EOC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This was a phase II, open-label study conducted at the
Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. The protocol was
approved by a regional institutional review board, and
all patients were required to sign an informed consent
form before enrollment. The primary objective was to
determine the tumor response rate; secondary objectives
included toxicity assessments and determination of
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).
Patients
Eligible patients had histologically proven epithelial
ovarian cancer, had received first-line chemotherapy with
platinum-based regimens, had recurrent disease after the
completion of chemotherapy or progressive disease during
treatment, had a period of at least 4 weeks since their last
round of chemotherapy, had an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, and had
an anticipated survival 3 months. Patients could have
received up to 2 prior chemotherapy regimens after recurrence. Laboratory criteria included WBC count 3.5 
109/L, neutrophil count 1.5  109/L, platelet count
100  109/L, hemoglobin level 9.0 g/dL, serum bilirubin level 2.0 mg/dL, serum AST/ALT and alkaline
phosphatase levels 2 times the upper limit of normal,
and serum creatinine level 1.5 mg/dL. We excluded
patients who had received chemotherapy or radiation
therapy within 4 weeks of the beginning of the trial, had

prior chemotherapy with a topoisomerase I inhibitor, and
had another malignant disease combined with EOC.
Treatment and Follow-Up
A previous phase I/IIa clinical study of combination
chemotherapy using belotecan and cisplatin demonstrated
that belotecan at a concentration of 0.3 mg/m2 daily for
5 days and cisplatin at 60 mg/m2 on day 5 was well
tolerated with acceptable toxicity.20 Therefore, in this
study, belotecan 0.3 mg/m2 was administered daily as a
30-minute infusion for 5 consecutive days, with carboplatin given at a dose of AUC 5 (Calvert formula) intravenously as a 30-minute infusion after belotecan on day 5.
Treatment was repeated every 3 weeks. The subsequent
chemotherapy cycles were administered only after recovery from hematological toxicity (neutrophil count of
1.0  109/L or greater, platelet count of 100  109/L or
greater, and hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL or greater) from
the previous course. Prophylactic administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was not done. When
the neutrophil count was less than 1.0  109/L, G-CSF was
administered at the discretion of the treating physician.
A 25% dose reduction of both drugs was performed,
irrespective of the addition of G-CSF, if grade 4 neutropenia was complicated by fever or infection or if it lasted
for 7 days or longer. A dose reduction was also required
if grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia lasted 7 days or longer
or if grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred,
excluding alopecia.
Assessments
Before treatment, a complete medical history was
recorded, and a physical examination was performed for
each patient. Performance status was noted, and disease
extent was measured. Laboratory tests, including complete blood cell count, relevant blood chemistries, and
cancer antigen (CA)–125, were performed within 14 days
prior to initiating treatment. Assessment of disease status,
including computed tomography, magnetic resonance,
and x-ray imaging, was performed every 6 weeks. CA-125
was measured with every cycle. Follow-up after treatment
completion was performed at 3-month intervals to collect
response and survival data.
Criteria for Assessing Response and Toxicity
Patients who received at least 2 cycles of chemotherapy
were evaluated for efficacy. Response was assessed every 2
cycles using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) in patients with measurable disease.25

Original Article

A complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all known disease for 4 weeks. A partial response
(PR) was defined as a 30% decrease in the sum of the
largest diameter of the target lesions for 4 weeks. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as a 20% increase in
the sum of the largest diameter of the target lesions or the
appearance of new lesions. Stable disease was defined as
disease that did not meet either PR or PD criteria. In
patients with nonmeasurable disease, the Gynecologic
Cancer Intergroup CA-125 response criteria were used for
efficacy analysis.26,27 CR was defined as a return of CA125 to <35 U/mL, confirmed by a second sample at least
4 weeks later. PR was defined as a >50% reduction in
CA-125 from baseline, and PD was defined as a doubling
of the CA-125 from the upper limit of normal or a
doubling from its nadir value. Stable disease was defined
as a <50% reduction in CA-125.
Progression-free survival was defined as the interval
between the date that treatment was initiated and the date
of documented disease progression. Overall survival was
defined as the interval between the date treatment started
and the date of death due to any cause. Toxicity was
graded using the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC) version 3.0. Each event’s
relationship to treatment was assessed by the treating
physician and documented. Adverse events were recorded
for up to 30 days after the last study treatment.
Statistical Analysis
Patient baseline characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Response rate (RR) was analyzed using
descriptive methods (frequency counts and proportions
of response) and is presented with the 95% confidence
interval. For patients who achieved a major objective
response (CR or PR), the median and range of both the
time to response and the duration of response were
measured and calculated. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates
were used to summarize the time-to-event variables such
as PFS and overall survival.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
From December 2006 to December 2009, 38 patients
participated in this trial (Table 1). The median age was 58
years (range, 39-77 years). The majority of patients had a
performance status of 0 to 1. The most common histology
was that of high-grade serous carcinoma. All patients
received first-line chemotherapy with taxane- and plati-

regimens. Twenty-two patients (57.9%) had platinumsensitive cancer, defined as prior response to platinumbased chemotherapy with a minimum platinum-free
interval (PFI) 6 months, whereas the other 16 patients
(42.1%) had platinum-resistant cancer with a minimum
platinum-free interval <6 months.
Toxicity
One hundred and sixty-seven courses of chemotherapy
were administered to 38 patients, with a median of 5
courses per patient (range 1-9). Of the 7 patients who
required dose reductions, 5 required reductions as a result
of thrombocytopenia and 2 as a result of prolonged neutropenia. Treatment delays of more than 7 days occurred
in 20.3% of courses (Table 2). The actual dose intensity

of belotecan for all patients was 0.446 mg/m2 weekly,
which is close to the target dose of 0.5 mg/m2 weekly.
The frequency of courses with hematologic and
nonhematologic toxicities is listed in Table 3. The major
toxicity of the treatment was bone marrow suppression.
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was observed in 48 of 167 treatment cycles (28.8%). Nine patients (40 cycles) were prescribed G-CSF by their treating physicians at some point
during therapy, and 3 cycles (2 patients) were dosereduced for both belotecan and carboplatin by 25%.
There were 2 episodes of febrile neutropenia in 2 patients,
but all episodes were managed successfully with supportive care; 1 patient withdrew consent after recovery from
the febrile neutropenia, which occurred following the first
cycle of chemotherapy. In addition, grade 3 or 4 anemia
and thrombocytopenia developed in 24 of all cycles
(14.4%) and 33 of all cycles (19.8%), respectively. Two
patients came off trial because of persistent thrombocytopenia of grade 4 lasting >2 weeks. One patient received

the belotecan and carboplatin as a third regimen after
recurrence, and the other as a second regimen after recurrence. There were no treatment-related deaths.
Serious toxic effects other than bone marrow suppression were infrequent. Three percent experienced
grade 3 nausea and vomiting. Four patients (10.5%)
experienced a carboplatin hypersensitivity reaction. Of
these patients, 2 discontinued treatment, and the others
continued receiving study treatment after conservative
management.
Response
Three patients were excluded from the evaluation of
response because they received only 1 course of chemotherapy because of significant hematologic toxicity. Of
the 35 patients included in the analysis, 20 exhibited an
objective tumor response, including 7 CR, for an overall
response rate of 57.1% (95% CI, 40.7%-73.5%; Tables 4
and 5). When assessing response using either RECIST
(n ¼ 7) or CA-125 criteria only (n ¼ 11), a higher
number of responses was noted in patients where the only
measure of disease response was RECIST (86% vs 55%).

In patients who met criteria for disease assessment by both
CA-125 and RECIST (n ¼ 17), the overall response rate
was 47.1%. Intent-to-treat analysis including those 3

patients with a PFI 6 months than in patients with a PFI
<6 months (8 vs 5 months, respectively; P ¼ .004). CA125 level before treatment (<287 U/mL vs 287 U/mL)
also significantly influenced PFS (8 vs 5 months,
respectively; P ¼ .035; Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
In this phase II study, we evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of belotecan combined with carboplatin for patients
with recurrent ovarian cancer. We found that this

combination is tolerable and has promising activity, with
an overall response rate of 57.1% and a median PFS of 7
months. The high overall response rate seen in this study
is even more meaningful because many patients in this
study had received a significant amount of prior therapy.
In addition, patients with a PFI <6 months also had a
favorable response rate (46.7%). This is the first study to
examine the combination of belotecan and carboplatin in
recurrent ovarian cancer. Until now, there have been no
studies using a belotecan-plus-carboplatin regimen to
treat any cancers.
The response in this study was comparable to the
responses observed with topotecan therapy, which in
phase II studies resulted in overall response rates ranging

Cancer

from 14% to 33%.28-31 Topotecan is widely used for second-line chemotherapy in ovarian cancer, and our findings suggest that belotecan combined with carboplatin
may be another potentially important second-line chemotherapy regimen. Kim et al compared the efficacies and
toxicities of topotecan- and belotecan-based chemotherapies in recurrent EOC.32 They reported that belotecanbased chemotherapy seemed to be efficacious with acceptable toxicity. In fact, the overall response rate was higher
in the belotecan group than in the topotecan group
(45.7% vs 24.4%, respectively; P ¼ .046), although there
were no significant differences in survival. In addition,
they found that belotecan-based chemotherapy caused less
hematologic toxicity such as anemia or thrombocytopenia
than did topotecan.
Several phase II studies of belotecan therapy alone or
in combination with cisplatin have been reported for
recurrent EOC to date (Table 6). A study of belotecan
alone indicated that the ORR was 21%-45.0% and that
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were
observed in 47.4%-71.7% and 4.6%-10.5% of patients,
respectively.18,19 Furthermore, a study of combination
chemotherapy using belotecan plus cisplatin every 3 weeks
found that the ORR was 47.1%-69.2%, and the most
common toxicity was grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, observed
in 38.3%-67.6%.19,20 The response rate was higher when
belotecan was combined with platinum compared with
that with belotecan alone (47%-69% vs 21%-45%). This
trend also has been shown in many studies using combination chemotherapy with topotecan and platinum-based
agents.33,34
In terms of the toxicity profile, hematologic toxicity
was the most common side effect of belotecan and carboplatin therapy. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild and
manageable. When compared with the previous studies,
in which belotecan with or without cisplatin was used,
grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (19.8%) in our study
seemed to occur more frequently than in the previous
studies (4.3%-11.8%; Table 6). It might be a result of the
inclusion of heavily pretreated patients and the use of
carboplatin in this study. Although direct comparison was
difficult in the absence of a comparative trial, grade 3 or 4
neutropenia (28.8%) in our study seemed to occur less
frequently than in the previous studies (38.3%-71.7%).
Higher doses of belotecan, which was used in the 2
trials,18,19 potentially have resulted in the more substantial hematologic toxicity that was observed in those trials.
In addition, the sequence of agents may have a
substantial impact on hematologic toxicity. Delayed

administration of carboplatin has been reported to reduce
the risk of bone marrow toxicity for the combination of
topotecan and carboplatin.35 This result can also be
expected in the combination of belotecan and carboplatin.
Although there are no data for the combination of belotecan and carboplatin, it can be suggested indirectly from
the data on the combination of belotecan and cisplatin
that hematologic toxicity was less frequent in Kim’s trial,
in which 60 mg of cisplatin was administered on day 5,
than in Nam’s, in which 50 mg of cisplatin was used on
day 1.19,20
There are some limitations in this study. The sample
size was small, and caution must be used in applying the
results to a general population. In addition, belotecan is
not commercially available in the United States and
most other countries; therefore, the applicability of this
regimen may be limited. Despite these limitations, we
have demonstrated that combination chemotherapy with
the newly developed agent belotecan and carboplatin
showed a promising response rate and a manageable toxicity profile in recurrent EOC. In fact, the response rates
and survival outcomes were favorable when compared
with other camptothecins already available, although our
small phase 2 study could not be compared directly with
those in larger studies.8,9,36,37 In addition, this regimen
may be very attractive option, even for patients with poor
performance status who were heavily pretreated, considering our acceptable toxicity profile in this patient population. Therefore, further investigation is strongly
warranted in patients with recurrent EOC.
