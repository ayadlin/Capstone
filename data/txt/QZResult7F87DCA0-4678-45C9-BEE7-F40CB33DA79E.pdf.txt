ABSTRACT
Due to its cytotoxic effect in lymphoid cells, dexamethasone is widely used in the
treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). However, only a subset of myeloma patients
responds to high-dose dexamethasone. Despite the undeniable anti-myeloma benefits
of dexamethasone, significant adverse effects have been reported. We re-evaluate
the anti-tumor effect of dexamethasone according to the molecular heterogeneity of
MM. We demonstrated that the pro-death effect of dexamethasone is related to the
genetic heterogeneity of MM because sensitive cell lines were restricted to MAF and
MMSET signature subgroups, whereas all CCND1 cell lines (n = 10) were resistant to
dexamethasone. We demonstrated that the glucocorticoid receptor expression was
an important limiting factor for dexamethasone-induced cell death and we found a
correlation between glucocorticoid receptor levels and the induction of glucocorticoidinduced leucine zipper (GILZ) under dexamethasone treatment. By silencing GILZ,
we next demonstrated that GILZ is necessary for Dex induced apoptosis while
triggering an imbalance between anti- and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Finally, the
heterogeneity of the dexamethasone response was further confirmed in vivo using
myeloma xenograft models. Our findings suggested that the effect of dexamethasone
should be re-evaluated within molecular subgroups of myeloma patients to improve
its efficacy and reduce its adverse effects.

doxorubicin and dexamethasone was mainly due to the
high doses of Dex [2]. Following the introduction of
thalidomide, Dex has mainly been used in combination
regimens because the combination of Dex with
thalidomide demonstrates significantly superior response
rates in newly diagnosed MM patients compared with
Dex alone [3]. More recently, Dex associated with
bortezomib and lenalidomide has appeared as the most
promising drug association recommended for high-risk
patients [4].
The effects of GCs occur through GC binding
to the GC receptor GR, a member of the type I nuclear
receptor superfamily. GR is transcribed from a single

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma
cell malignancy despite considerable improvements to
survival due to the introduction of new drugs, such as
proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents [1].
Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used in the treatment
of MM, mainly in combination regimens. Among GCs,
dexamethasone (Dex) is used in all phases of treatment,
including induction, consolidation and maintenance. In
1992, Alexanian et al showed that high doses of Dex
were effective in about half of untreated MM patients
and that the efficacy of the combination of vincristine,

gene, NR3C1, located on chromosome 5. However, GR
actions are dependent on multiple receptor isoforms.
Alternative splicing of GR pre-mRNA produces five
distinct GR protein isoforms: the predominant full-length
GRα, the dominant negative GRβ, and the three less-well
characterized and less abundant isoforms GRγ, GR-A and
GR-P [5, 6]. Resistance to GCs is not fully understood
because multiple molecular mechanisms are involved and
are likely cell-type specific [7, 8]. However, altered or
low-level GR expression accounts for inherent resistance
to GCs [8]. Resistance may also occur downstream of
GR. GCs bind GR, which then translocates to the nucleus
and interacts with either GC-response elements to induce
gene transcription (transactivation) or directly interacts
with transcription factors, such as NFKB or AP-1 to
repress their activity (transrepression). The transactivation
activity of GR is highly regulated and required for GCinduced apoptosis involving the intrinsic mitochondrial
pathway [6, 9]. The TSC22D3 gene encoding the GCinduced leucine zipper protein GILZ is one of the most
strongly up-regulated genes by GCs [10] . An important
overlap between the effect of GILZ and those of GCs was
demonstrated, suggesting that GILZ is a critical mediator
of the therapeutic effect of GCs [11–13]. GILZ protein is
involved in numerous protein/protein interactions and thus
regulates multiple signaling pathways, including NF-κB
and Ras [11–13].
Among the multiple candidate genes involved in
GC-induced apoptosis, BCL2L11, which encodes the proapoptotic Bim protein, appears to be the most important.
In 2003, BCL2L11 was identified as a GC-induced death
gene (18). Since that time, numerous studies have shown
that Bim is a key mediator of GC-induced cell death in
lymphoid cells [9, 14–16].
MM is molecularly heterogeneous, with
chromosomal abnormalities that include full or partial
deletions of chromosomes 13 or 17, amplification of
1q21, recurrent translocations of 14q32 or hyperdiploidy
[17–19]. The recurrent 14q32 translocation and
hyperdiploidy are associated with distinct gene
expression profiles that define several groups, namely
the HY, MS, CD-1/2 and MF groups, characterized
by the hyperdiploid, MMSET, CCND1 and MAF
signatures, respectively. The MS and MF subgroups
have been associated with poor overall survival [20, 21].
Although c-maf translocation is only found in 5 to 10%
of patients, c-maf is overexpressed in approximately
50% of patients and is regulated both by the MEK and
MMSET pathways [22, 23].
Because only 50% of untreated MM patients
respond to high doses of Dex [2], our study was
undertaken to re-evaluate the anti-tumor effect of Dex
according to the molecular heterogeneity of MM patients
using a large collection of myeloma cell lines (n = 31) that
are representative of the molecular translocations found
in patients.

The cellular response to Dex was correlated with
the molecular subtype of human myeloma cell
lines (HMCLs)
Although it is well accepted that Dex induces
apoptosis in MM, the variability of the response among
HMCLs with different genetic backgrounds harboring
the main recurrent translocations has never been
investigated. HMCLs were classified into MF, MS and
CCND1 subgroups according to their IgH translocation
(Supplementary Table S1). All HMCLs that did not
present the main recurrent translocations leading to MAF,
MMSET or CCND1 over-expression were classified into
the “Others” subgroup. Cell death induction was assessed
across a panel of 31 HMCLs following Dex treatment for
72 hours. The dose of 1 μM of Dex was chosen because
there is no dose response effect in cell death induction
for Dex concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μM
(Supplementary Figure S1A). The ability of Dex to induce
myeloma cell death was very heterogeneous within the
different subgroups of HMCLs (Figure 1A, Supplementary
Table S1). Dex-induced apoptosis was restricted to the MF
and MS subgroups, with a mean number of apoptotic cells
of 25% and 24%, respectively (Figure 1A). In contrast,
no cell death was induced by Dex in any of the CCND1
HMCLs (n = 10). We first determined whether cell death
was associated with caspase activation and PARP1
cleavage in a selected panel of cell lines, including Dexsensitive (>15% cell death) and Dex-resistant HMCLs,
which were representative of the molecular diversity of
MM (Figure 1B). The results in Figure 1C showed that
the activation of caspase 3 and the PARP1 cleavage were
effective in all sensitive cell lines. Then, the effect of Dex
was assessed in 19 primary myeloma cells, showing that
cell death induction was highly heterogeneous from 0 to
96% (Table 1, Supplementary Figure S1B). Four samples
harbored an IgH translation, one with a t(14;16), one
with a t(4;14) and two with a t(11;14). Of note, the MF
and MS patient were sensitive (92% and 49% cell death
respectively), whereas the CCND1 patients were resistant
(2% and 4% cell death). Two samples at diagnosis
appeared resistant to Dex, indicating that primary tumor
cells could present an inherent resistance to Dex.

High NR3C1 expression characterized the MF
and hyperdiploid (HY) subgroups of myeloma
patients
Because Dex exerts its action through the GR, we
investigated GR expression by transcriptomic Affymetrix
analysis of the NR3C1 gene in the different HMCL
subgroups. NR3C1 gene expression was heterogeneous
among the HMCL subgroups (p = 0.02); however, the
MF and MS subgroups exhibited a higher expression

compared with the CCND1 and Others subgroups (1.8fold mean increase, p = 0.002) (Figure 2A). We also found
that NR3C1 expression was significantly higher in the MF
subgroup compared with all other HMCLs (1.4-fold mean
increase, p = 0.029) (Figure 2A). We then took advantage
of the publicly available Affymetrix gene expression
microarray data from 309 newly diagnosed MM patients
to analyze NR3C1 expression in the MF, MS, CCND1
and HY groups of patients, as previously defined [18].
We first noticed that none of the patients completely
lacked NR3C1 expression but that NR3C1 levels were
significantly different between the molecular subgroups
(p < 0.0001). Of note, MF patients expressed significantly
higher levels of NR3C1 than all other subgroups (1.8fold mean change, p < 0.0001) (Figure 2B), suggesting
that the specific regulation of NR3C1 expression may
occur in MF patients. Moreover, HY patients expressed
significantly higher levels of NR3C1 than MS and CCND1
patients (1.3-fold mean increase, p < 0.0001) (Figure 2B),
which may be explained by the localization of the NR3C1

gene on chromosome 5. Indeed, chromosome 5 trisomy is
frequent in hyperdiploid MM [24].

Levels of GR expression appear to be a limiting
factor for Dex-induced cell death
To deepen the understanding of Dex sensitivity, we
established two Dex-resistant cell lines, NAN8DR and
MM.1SDR, obtained by long-term culture of the parental
cell lines with a low Dex concentration (Supplementary
Figure S2). NAN8DR and MM.1SDR cells were
characterized by an absence of cell death induction (0%
cell death in both NAN8DR and MM.1SDR compared
with 58% and 35% in the parental cell lines, respectively)
associated with nearly no caspase activation and no PARP1
cleavage under Dex treatment (Supplementary Figure S2).
In contrast, their sensitivity to bortezomib or lenalidomide
was unchanged (Supplementary Figure S2). To determine
whether long-term Dex treatment affected the GR levels in
resistant cell lines compared with their respective parental

by the TSC22D3 GC-transactivated gene. After Dex
exposure, TSC22D3 levels were up-regulated in most cell
lines (Figure 3A). However, resistant cell lines failed to upregulate TSC22D3 to the same extent as sensitive cell lines
(Figure 3A). Of note, a correlation was found between the
levels of GR expression and Dex-induced TSC22D3 upregulation (p = 0.03, Rho: 0.68) (Figure 3B). Analysis of
the GILZ protein under Dex treatment confirmed a stronger
up-regulation of GILZ not only in sensitive cell lines but
also in KMS12-PE cells, which expressed high levels of GR
(Figure 3C). To assess whether GILZ may influence the Dex
response, we next performed transient knockdown of GILZ
in both OPM2 and BCN cell lines. Indeed, GILZ silencing
strongly reduced Dex-induced apoptosis (54% decrease,
p = 0.008) in OPM2 cell line (Figure 3D) and to a lesser
extent in BCN (30% decrease, p = 0.03) (Supplementary
Figure S3). However, this weaker effect on Dex-induced
apoptosis in BCN compared to OPM2 is probably due to the
less efficient GILZ silencing (40% versus 83% inhibition
respectively). Altogether, these results highlighted the
implication of GILZ in Dex-induced apoptosis.

cell lines, we assessed NR3C1 levels by Q-PCR. NAN8DR
and MM.1SDR cells expressed very low NR3C1 levels
compared with the parental cell lines (Figure 2C). We
next compared the NR3C1 levels in our selected panel of
cell lines and showed that sensitive cell lines demonstrated
higher NR3C1 levels than resistant cell lines (p = 0.036)
(Figure 2D). However, we noticed that among the resistant
cell lines, KMS12-PE expressed higher NR3C1 levels than
other resistant cell lines. Additionally, with some exceptions,
we showed a correlation between NR3C1 mRNA expression
and the pro-apoptotic effect of Dex (Figure 2E, p < 0.0001,
Rho: 0.70). Finally, we found a correlation between NR3C1
and MAF expression suggesting that NR3C1 expression may
be linked with MAF expression (Figure 2F, p = 0.0012, Rho
= 0.55). In its inactive form, GR is located in the cytoplasm;
once activated by GC, it is translocated to the nucleus [25].
Thus, we analyzed GR protein expression in the cytosolic
fraction and its translocation to the nucleus. Dex treatment
induces the total translocation of GR to the nuclear fraction
irrespective of its endogenous level (Figure 2G). Altogether,
these results suggested that low levels of GR appear to be
one of the first limiting events in Dex resistance.

as one of the key mediators of GC-induced apoptosis
[14–16]. In addition to Bim, Puma another BH3-only
member was also shown to contribute to GC-induced
apoptosis [15]. Furthermore, based on a previous
microarray analysis in MM.1S cells [26], the BCL2L1 gene
that encodes Bcl-xL was shown to be the only anti-apoptotic
gene strongly down-regulated by Dex. We demonstrated
that a strong up-regulation of all Bim isoforms occurred
mainly in sensitive cell lines but also in KMS12-PE Dexresistant cells (Figure 4A). When Puma was endogenously
expressed in the HMCLs, we observed a weak Puma upregulation in parallel to Bim up-regulation (Figure 4A).
The anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein was not modulated with
the exception of OPM2 where Mcl-1 is down-regulated.
In contrast to Mcl-1, we showed that Bcl-xL protein
expression was strongly decreased in all Dex-sensitive
HMCLs, whereas its expression was weakly modified in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Dex-resistant HMCLs (Figure 4A). These results may
indicate that the apoptotic response is associated with
an imbalance between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins.
We next demonstrated that Bim silencing in OPM2 cells
caused a significant decrease in Dex-induced cell death
(51%, p = 0.004) (Figure 4B). Finally, because the resistant
KMS12-PE HMCL is characterized by an increase in Bim
under Dex treatment but an absence of Bcl-xL downregulation, we silenced Bcl-xL to determine whether its
down-regulation could overcome Dex resistance. Despite
the complete silencing of Bcl-xL in KMS12-PE cells,
Dex did not induce significant cell death, indicating that
Bcl-xL down-regulation concomitant to Bim up-regulation
was not sufficient to counteract Dex resistance in this
CCND1 HMCL (Figure 4C). Of interest, the silencing
of GILZ impairs both Bim up-regulation and Bcl-xL
down-regulation under Dex treatment (Figure 4D). Finally,

we demonstrated that GILZ silencing decreased BCL2L11
(Bim) up-regulation at the transcriptional level (33%
decrease, p = 0.03) (Figure 4E). Altogether, these results
seem to indicate a pivotal role for GILZ in Dex-induced
cell death through the regulation of the Bcl-2 protein
network.

highlighted that the Dex pro-apoptotic effect was restricted
to the MF and MS subgroups of HMCLs, whereas all other
cell lines were totally resistant to Dex. In particular, all
CCND1 HMCLs and primary samples were resistant to
Dex-induced cell death. The analysis of Dex sensitivity in
relation to NR3C1 levels revealed that the MF subgroup
expressed the highest levels of NR3C1, which may
partially explain their stronger sensitivity to Dex. A
previous study has also reported a link between GC and
MAF showing that GC reduced c-maf protein levels via an
ubiquitination-dependent degradation [27]. Nevertheless,
more investigations will be necessary to explain the overexpression of NR3C1 in the MF subgroup. In addition, the
localization of the NR3C1 gene on chromosome 5 probably
explains the higher levels of NR3C1 found in the HY
subgroup compared with the MS and CCND1 subgroups
because chromosome 5 trisomy is frequently found in
hyperdiploid MM [24]. The generation of MF or MS Dexresistant HMCLs after long-term exposure to Dex led to an
important decrease in NR3C1, indicating that an NR3C1
level seems necessary for Dex-induced apoptosis. To
support this hypothesis, we showed a correlation between
NR3C1 levels and the apoptotic response in HMCLs.
Consistently, a poor prognosis has been associated with low
NR3C1 expression in MM patients [28, 29]. In addition,
we demonstrated that Dex induced the total translocation
of GR to the nucleus in all HMCLs tested, even in resistant
cell lines, showing that the ability of GR to translocate to
the nucleus is not a limiting step in Dex resistance.
Many studies in hematopoietic cells, essentially in
T and dendritic cells, have identified GILZ as one of the
main GC-regulated genes [30, 31]. The GILZ promoter
includes 6 GC-responsive element motifs that allow for GR

Dexamethasone reduced tumor cell growth of in
vitro sensitive but not resistant cells
To assess whether the differential in vitro activity of
Dex could reflect its in vivo activity, both Dex-sensitive
(OPM2) and Dex-resistant (KMS12-PE) cell lines were
xenografted into SCID mice. Mice were subcutaneously
inoculated with 12 × 106 cells. When mice bore tumors of
similar sizes, they were randomly separated into 2 groups
and received either vehicle (control) or Dex (1 mg/kg)
5 days a week for 3 consecutive weeks (Figure 5). When
the tumor sizes exceeded 2000 mm3, mice were sacrificed
on day 19 and 17 for mice grafted with OPM2 and KMS12PE cells respectively. Dex significantly inhibited OPM2
tumor growth (Figure 5A) (p < 0.05), but failed to reduce
tumor growth of the in vitro resistant KMS12-PE cells
(Figure 5B). Taken together, these data demonstrated that
the in vivo pro-apoptotic Dex effect in pre-clinical myeloma
models is related to in vitro Dex-induced cell death.

DISCUSSION
Because clinical practice has frequently been
based on empirical studies, our study was undertaken to
re-evaluate Dex, a conventional therapy, according to
the molecular classification of MM patients. Our results

homodimer binding and transactivation [32]. In the present
study, we demonstrated that Dex induced an up-regulation
of GILZ in all HMCLs but that this up-regulation was
significantly higher in sensitive cell lines. Furthermore, we
found a correlation between NR3C1 levels and TSC22D3
mRNA up-regulation. This result reinforces the fact that
GILZ expression was proposed as a reliable measure
of GR function [33]. We also demonstrated that GILZ
silencing induced a strong reduction in Dex-induced cell
death. This is in agreement with a study from Grugan et al
[34], which has already implicated GILZ in Dex-induced
apoptosis. However, in this previous study, the reduction
in Dex-induced cell death caused by GILZ silencing was
very modest (10%). Altogether, these data now clearly
indicate a pivotal role of GILZ in the induction of cell
death by Dex. Although Dex-induced apoptosis required
the contribution of multiple processes, modification of the
Bcl-2 protein rheostat has been reported as a key process
[35]. Particularly, BH3-only members have been shown to
be important mediators of GC-induced apoptosis [14–16].
In our HMCL collection, we demonstrated that a strong
Bim up-regulation associated with a weak Puma upregulation occurs mainly in Dex-sensitive cell lines, but
also in the Dex-resistant KMS12-PE cell line. We further
demonstrated that Bim silencing led to a strong reduction
in apoptosis, which confirms the important role of Bim
in the cell death process induced by Dex. In parallel with
Bim up-regulation, we observed a strong down-regulation
of Bcl-xL, which is restricted to sensitive HMCLs. Thus,
an imbalance between anti- and pro-apoptotic molecules
occurred, leading to a decrease in the apoptotic threshold
in Dex-sensitive cell lines. Of interest, GILZ silencing
provided evidence that GILZ contributed to the regulation
of the Bcl-2 protein network by inducing Bim up-regulation
and Bcl-xL down-regulation. The regulation of Bcl-xL by
GILZ is in agreement with a previous study showing that
Bcl-xL is decreased in GILZ-overexpressing transgenic mice
[36]. The implication of GILZ in Bim up-regulation remains
an important question that deserves further investigation.
Altogether, our data reinforce the importance of GILZ in
the pro-apoptotic effect of GC in hematopoietic tumor cells.
Whereas CCND1 HMCLs have a low level of GR,
which could in part account for their resistance to Dex,
KMS12-PE cells exhibited a high level of GR, leading to
both a significant induction of GILZ and up-regulation
of Bim without the induction of apoptosis. Because Dex
did not induced Bcl-xL down-regulation in KMS12-PE
cells as it did in other sensitive cell lines, we forced this
down-regulation, showing that concomitant Bcl-xL downregulation, Bim up-regulation and GILZ induction were not
sufficient to counteract the Dex resistance of KMS12-PE
cells. We cannot rule out other factors that may contribute
to the Dex response. Finally, the in vivo growth of myeloma
cells in our mouse model confirmed the heterogeneity of
Dex efficacy, which corroborated our in vitro findings.
Indeed, whereas Dex led to a reduction of MS tumor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

growth, Dex had no effect on CCND1 tumor growth. Of
note, the dual action of GCs in survival has been reported
[37, 38]. Indeed, it was demonstrated that although Dex
induced the apoptosis of a large majority of primary
leukemia cells from children with newly diagnosed acute
leukemia, the survival of a subset of primary acute leukemia
samples (32%) was increased by GCs [37]. Furthermore,
our results seem to indicate that Dex had no pro-apoptotic
effects on CCND1 myeloma cells both in vitro and in vivo,
despite the presence of effective GR. Interestingly, the
CCND1 subgroup has already been distinguished from
other subgroups by its particular anti- and pro-apoptotic
Bcl-2 member expression and its specific drug response [39,
40]. Altogether, these results indicated that both the MF and
CCND1 subgroups presented important specificities that
require better analysis during the course of the disease and
the response to treatment. The risk/benefit of prolonged
GC treatment should be re-evaluated to propose optimal
treatments by GCs for each molecular group of MM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, primary myeloma cells and culture
conditions
HMCLs BCN, MDN, SBN, NAN-1, -6, -7, -8, -10
and XG-1, -2, -3, -5, -6, -7 were derived in our laboratory
from primary myeloma cells in the presence of interleukin
(IL)-6. ANBL-6 was kindly provided by Dr. Jelinek
(Rochester, MN). KMS11, KMS12-BM, KMS12-PE, and
KMM1 were kindly provided by Dr. Otsuki (Kurashiki,
Japan). JJN3, JIM3, Karpas620, and MM.1S were,
respectively, kindly provided by Drs. Van Riet (Brussels,
Belgium), MacLennan (Birmingham, UK), Karpas
(Cambridge, UK), and S. Rosen (Chicago, IL). AMO1,
LP1, L363, NCI-H929, SKMM2, U266, and OPM2 were
purchased from the DSMZ, and RPMI8226 from American
Type Culture Collection. Each HMCL was characterized
and identified as previously described [41–43].
After obtaining informed consent, blood or bone
marrow samples from MM patients were collected at the
Department of Hematology at the University Hospital of
Nantes or at the Intergroupe Francophone du Myélome
(ethical approval n° DC-2011–1399, Pr Rodat). Plasma
cells were purified with CD138 immunomagnetic beads.
The purity of the plasma cells was greater than 90%, as
assessed morphologically or by CD138 staining.

Reagents
Dexamethasone was purchased from SigmaAldrich (Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France) and dissolved
in ethanol at 1 mM as a stock solution. For the in vivo
study, Dex was dissolved in ethanol and then in PBS at a
final Dex concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, with a final ethanol
concentration of less than 3%.

Cell death assays

Affymetrix Amazonia database (http://amazonia.
transcriptome.eu/). HMCL gene expression analyses were
performed with the RAGE database. The probes used for
analyses were as follows: 211671_s_at for the NR3C1
gene, 209348_s_at for the cMAF gene and 218559_s_at
for the MAFB gene.

The evaluation of cell death in HMCLs was
performed by flow cytometry using Apo2.7 staining.
Cell death in primary myeloma cells was measured after
48  hours of culture in RPMI-1640 containing 5% FCS
with or without Dex (1 μM) by assessing the loss of
CD138 staining, as previously described [42].

RNA extraction, reverse transcription and
quantitative real-time PCR

Establishment of Dex-resistant cell lines

RNA extraction, reverse transcription and Q-PCR
were performed as previously described [45]. TaqMan
gene expression assays for NR3C1 (Hs00353740_m1),
TSC22D3 (Hs00608272_m1), BCL2L11 (Hs00708019_s1)
and RPL37A (Hs01102345_m1, housekeeping gene) were
obtained from Applied Biosystems (Life Technologies, St
Aubin, France).

To establish Dex-resistant cell lines, NAN8
and MM.1S cells were continuously treated with Dex
beginning with a dose of 0.001 μM. After cells displayed
a viability of 80% under continuous exposure to a low
Dex concentration, the drug dose was doubled. This
process was repeated until cells were cultured in a Dex
concentration of 10 μM. Prior to the experiments, the cells
were cultured in Dex-free medium for 5 days before use.

Cell fractionation

Immunoblotting

Cell fractionation was performed using a Nuclear
Extraction kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, USA)
by following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the
cytosolic fraction was first obtained after lysis using a
hypotonic buffer. Then, the nuclear fraction was obtained
after 30 minutes incubation with a nuclear extraction buffer.

Western blotting analyses were performed as
previously described [44]. The following antibodies were
used: caspase-3 (E-8), GR (E-20), lamin A/C (E-1), GILZ
(FL-134), Mcl-1 (S-19) (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany),
Puma (D30C10) (Cell Signaling Technology, Saint Quentin,
France), tubulin (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Velizy,
France), Bcl-xL (BD Transduction Laboratories, Rungis,
France), Bim, PARP1 (Ab-2) and actin (Merck Chemicals,
Nottingham, UK). Protein expression was quantified and
normalized to actin expression using ImageJ software.

Xenotransplant
Female, beige, 6-week-old SCID mice were purchased
from Charles River (L’Arbresle, France). Mice were bred
and housed in the Experimental Therapeutic Unit (UTE,
SFR Bonamy, Nantes, France) under animal care license
n°44565. OPM2 or KMS12-PE tumors were generated
by implanting 12 × 106 cells in 100 μl of PBS/Matrigel
(1:1, Corning) in the right flank above the hind leg [46].
The tumor volume was recorded in three dimensions using
a digital caliper and calculated as the length x width x depth.
When the mice bore similar tumor sizes (approximately
100 mm3), they were randomly separated into 2 groups
(6 mice per group) and received an intraperitoneal injection
(i.p.) of either vehicle (PBS-diluted ethanol) or Dex (1 mg/
kg) 5 days a week for 3 consecutive weeks. Animals were
sacrificed when their tumor sizes reached 2000 mm3.

RNA interference assays
Control nontargeted siRNA, siBim and siGILZ were
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg,
Germany), and siBcl-xL was purchased from Thermo
Scientific (Ilkirch, France). OPM2 cells were transfected using
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, St
Aubin, France) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells per well in a 6-well
plate. After 24 hours, 100 pmol siRNA was transfected
into the cells using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent.
Cells were incubated for 72 hours for siBim and 48 hours
for siGILZ before being subjected to various analyses.
KMS12-PE and BCN cells were transfected using the Amaxa
4D-Nucleofector (Lonza, Cologne, Germany). The cell pellet
was resuspended with 100 μl solution F (Lonza) containing
100 pmol siRNA and electroporated using the CA137 or the
DN100 program for KMS12-PE and BCN, respectively. After
24 hours, the cells were treated with Dex.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using Mann–
Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, Spearman, Wilcoxon matchedpairs signed rank or a two-way ANOVA test.
