ABSTRACT
In this study, we examined the molecular mechanism underlying the resistance
of cancer cells to R27T, a glycoengineered version of recombinant human interferon
(IFN)-β1a, and sought to overcome R27T resistance through combination therapy.
R27T has been shown to induce anti-proliferation and apoptosis in human OVCAR-3 and
MCF-7 cells, but not in HeLa cells. R27T treatment increased caspase-8 activity and the
consequent cleavage of caspase-8 and -3 in R27T-sensitive OVCAR-3 cells, but not in
R27T-resistant HeLa cells. Conversely, R27T increased the expression of cellular FLICElike inhibitory protein (cFLIP) in HeLa cells, but not in OVCAR-3 cells. The sensitization
of HeLa cells with cFLIP small interfering RNA or 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole
(TBB, an inhibitor of casein kinase-2) facilitated R27T-induced caspase activation, and
consequently apoptosis. In OVCAR-3-xenografted mice, intraperitoneal administration
of R27T showed 2.1-fold higher anti-tumor efficacy than did the control vehicle. The
combined administration of R27T and TBB showed the greatest anti-tumor effect in
HeLa tumor-bearing mice, reducing the relative tumor volume by 35.7% compared
to that in R27T-treated mice. Taken together, our results suggest that R27T has
potential as an anti-cancer drug, and combination therapy with cFLIP inhibitors may
be an effective strategy for overcoming R27T resistance.

molecule, IFN-β1a. However, the anti-cancer efficacy of
R27T has not yet been fully explored. In addition, IFN-β
resistance reportedly develops in diverse tumor cells
via deregulation of the IFN-β signaling pathway [4–6].
Therefore, we need to explore additional approaches,
such as combination therapy, as a means to enhance the
therapeutic efficacy of R27T.
In this study, the anti-cancer efficacy of R27T was
first examined in various cancer cells. We found that
the resistance to R27T-induced anti-proliferation and
apoptosis was due to the increased expression of cellular
FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP), which blocks
the initiation of caspase activation. We investigated
whether the inhibition of cFLIP could facilitate R27Tinduced caspase activation. Therefore, we evaluated
the ability of cFLIP small interfering RNA (siRNA) or
4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole (TBB, a casein kinase-2

INTRODUCTION
Interferon-β (IFN-β) has emerged as a potential
anti-cancer drug that can effectively induce cancer growth
arrest by decreasing cell proliferation and inducing
apoptosis [1]. However, the use of IFN-β in anti-cancer
therapy has been hampered by its low stability and
relatively short circulating half-life (3-5 h in humans) [2].
In a previous study, we developed R27T, a
glycoengineered version of recombinant human IFN-β1a.
R27T has two N-glycosylation sites: at the 80th amino
acid (the original site) and an additional site at the 25th
amino acid, induced by mutating an arginine to threonine
at the 27th position [3]. R27T exhibited superior stability,
solubility, productivity, and pharmacokinetic properties
without any loss of biological activity or alteration of
receptor binding affinity, compared to those of its parent

R27T in vitro and in vivo.

by the results of western blot analysis, two sizes of FAS
or TRAIL proteins were detected at 45/48 or 28/30 kDa,
respectively (Figure 2E and 2F). Previous reports showed
that two molecular weights of FAS protein resulted from
different glycosylation patterns [7], and TRAIL existed
in two isoforms [8]. Overall, these results indicate that
R27T resistance is not associated with changes in IFNinduced signal transduction or the induction of apoptotic
mediators.

RESULTS
R27T induces anti-proliferation and apoptosis
To investigate the anti-cancer efficacy of R27T in
vitro, we carried out two different assays in OVCAR-3,
MCF-7, HeLa, and TOV-21G cells. The cell proliferation
assay revealed that R27T showed a concentrationdependent anti-proliferative effect in OVCAR-3 and
MCF-7 cells, but not in HeLa or TOV-21G cells (Figure
1A). Treatment of OVCAR-3 and MCF-7 cells with R27T
decreased cell viability by 86.1 ± 2.1 and 60.4 ± 1.7% at
72 h post-treatment, respectively. In contrast, R27T did
not significantly induce anti-cancer activity in HeLa cells
compared with that in control cells. The live fluorescence
assay system yielded similar results, which showed that
R27T exerted notable cell-killing effects in OVCAR-3
and MCF-7 cells, but not in HeLa or TOV-21G cells
(Figure 1B).
Next, we examined whether R27T could induce
apoptosis in OVCAR-3, MCF-7, HeLa, and/or TOV-21G
cells. We found that the treatment of OVCAR-3 and MCF7 cells with R27T increased the proportion of late-stage
apoptotic cells to 78.3 and 40.0%, respectively, compared
to less than 15% in the untreated cells. However, R27T
treatment did not alter the population of late-stage
apoptotic cells in HeLa or TOV-21G cells (Figure 1C).
Thus, our results suggest that R27T exhibits differential
anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in R27Tsensitive cells (OVCAR-3 and MCF-7) versus R27Tresistant cells (HeLa and TOV-21G).

R27T-resistant cancer cells exhibit increased
cFLIPS expression and blockade of caspase
activation
To test whether changes in caspase activity
contribute to R27T resistance, we examined caspase-8
activity in R27T-sensitive OVCAR-3 cells and R27Tresistant HeLa cells. Following R27T treatment, caspase-8
activity significantly and time-dependently increased up
to 48 h post-treatment in OVCAR-3 cells (to 5.4-fold the
basal activity; Figure 3A), but not in HeLa cells (Figure
3B). Western blotting analysis of caspase-8, -9, and -3
showed that these proteins were cleaved following R27T
treatment of R27T-sensitive OVCAR-3 cells (Figure 3C)
but not R27T-resistant HeLa cells (Figure 3D). These
results demonstrated that the activation of caspase cascade
might be blocked in R27T-resistant cells.
cFLIP is a crucial negative regulator of caspase-8
activation [9]. Therefore, we next examined the expression
level of cFLIP in R27T-sensitive and -resistant cells.
Increased expression of cFLIPL and cFLIPS was observed
in HeLa cells compared to that in OVCAR-3 cells without
R27T treatment. cFLIPS was not detected in OVCAR-3
cells (Supplementary Figure 1). Notably, there was no
difference in the expression level of cFLIP protein in
OVCAR-3 cells after R27T treatment compared with
that in the control cells (Figure 3C). In contrast, cFLIPS
protein expression was significantly increased in R27Ttreated HeLa cells at 72 h (Figure 3D). To substantiate
these results, we sought to test whether the late increase
of cFLIPS level is related to transcription factors such as
NF-κB and NFAT. We found that R27T treatment of both
OVCAR-3 and HeLa cells did not significantly alter the
NF-κB p65 levels for 72 h (Supplementary Figure 2).
However, the activation of p65 (phosphorylated p65) and
NFAT1c (dephosphorylated NFAT1c) was greater in HeLa
cells (Supplementary Figure 2B) than in OVCAR-3 cells
(Supplementary Figure 2A). These results revealed that
the late expression of cFLIPS in R27T-resistant cells
might be influenced by the increased activation of p65 and
NFAT1c following R27T treatment.
The co-treatment of OVCAR-3 cells with the pancaspase inhibitor, zVAD, recovered cell viability by 89.1
± 6.6% compared to less than 20% observed in OVCAR-3
cells treated with R27T alone (Figure 3E). We ascertained
whether the overexpression of cFLIPS plays a role in

Induction of apoptotic mediators does not
correlate with R27T resistance
To investigate whether R27T resistance is related
to IFN-induced signaling, we transiently transfected
OVCAR-3 and HeLa cells with the interferon-sensitive
response element (ISRE) luciferase reporter plasmid.
R27T treatment (100 ng/mL) resulted in 2.7- and 14.9fold increase of ISRE luciferase activity in R27T-sensitive
OVCAR-3 cells (Figure 2A) and R27T-resistant HeLa
cells (Figure 2B), compared with their respective controls.
To examine whether R27T resistance was correlated
with the induction of apoptotic mediators, we compared
the mRNA and protein expression levels of death receptor
4 (DR4), FAS, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and
TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in R27Tsensitive OVCAR-3 and R27T-resistant HeLa cells.
qRT-PCR and western blotting analysis showed that the
mRNA (Figure 2C and 2D) and protein (Figure 2E and 2F)
expression levels of FAS, TNF-α, and TRAIL increased
in both cell lines following R27T treatment. As shown

apoptosis resistance. When OVCAR-3 cells transfected
with cFLIPS expression vector was treated with R27T, cell
viability was restored to 81 ± 5.2% (Figure 3F). Taken
together, these results show that an increase in cFLIPS
expression contributes to the impairment of caspase
activation in R27T-resistant cells.

product (Figure 4C). A previous study reported that
inhibition of CK-2 by TBB decreased the endogenous
cFLIP levels via proteasome-mediated degradation
of cFLIP, leading to the enhancement of TRAIL and
FAS sensitivity in endometrial carcinoma cells [10].
Therefore, HeLa cells were co-treated with R27T and
TBB, which resulted in the reduction of cFLIP expression.
Furthermore, co-treatment of R27T with TBB resulted in
2.3-fold increase in caspase-8 activity (Figure 4B) and the
cleavage of caspase-8 (Figure 4D). Immunoprecipitation
of cFLIPL and cFLIPS with an anti-caspase-8 antibody
revealed that TBB treatment did not inhibit cFLIP binding
with caspase-8 but only decreased cFLIP expression,
thereby activating caspase-8 on R27T co-treatment
(Supplementary Figure 3).

Inhibition of cFLIP expression facilitates caspase
activation
We further verified the effect of suppression of
cFLIP on caspase-8 activity. Caspase-8 activity in HeLa
cells treated with cFLIP siRNA plus R27T was 2.7-fold
higher than that in HeLa cells treated with R27T alone
(Figure 4A), and we detected the cleaved caspase-8

pro-apoptotic effects

in cFLIP staining was observed in HeLa tumor tissues of
R27T plus TBB-treated mice (Supplementary Figure 5).
Collectively, these results indicate that the anti-tumor
activity of R27T could be enhanced by combination
treatment with TBB.

We next examined whether the cFLIP siRNA- or
TBB-mediated inhibition of cFLIP expression could
enhance the anti-cancer efficacy of R27T in vitro. In the
WST assay system, combined treatment of R27T and
cFLIP siRNA significantly reduced HeLa cell viability to
54.1 ± 2.5% (Figure 5A). For the establishment of cFLIP
overexpression in HeLa cells, cFLIPL, cFLIPS, or cFLIPL
+ S vectors were transfected. Western blot assay showed
an increase in cFLIP protein expression (Supplementary
Figure 4). The anti-cancer activity of R27T plus TBB
was  2.1-, 3.0-, or 2.9-fold greater in control vectortransfected HeLa cells than in HeLa cells transfected with
cFLIPL, cFLIPS, and cFLIPL + S vector, respectively
(Figure 5D). In control vector-transfected HeLa cells,
R27T plus TBB exerted 3.6-fold greater cell-killing effect
compared with that of free R27T. Similarly, fluorescent
microscopy revealed that the smallest live-cell populations
were observed in cultures co-treated with R27T and
cFLIP siRNA (Figure 5B) or TBB (Figure 5E). Moreover,
apoptosis was significantly increased when HeLa cells
were co-treated with R27T and cFLIP siRNA or TBB,
with the late apoptotic cell populations increasing to 63.5
(Figure 5C) or 51.6% (Figure 5F) compared to less than
10% observed in the controls, respectively. These results
suggest that the combined treatment of R27T and a cFLIP
inhibitor can overcome R27T resistance and increase the
therapeutic efficacy of R27T in resistant cells.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrate the concentrationdependent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects
of R27T in OVCAR-3 and MCF-7 cells via significant
induction of IFN and death receptor signaling pathways.
In contrast, R27T did not exhibit significant anti-cancer
activity in HeLa cells, in which the overexpression of
cFLIPS was associated with impaired caspase-8 activity
and R27T resistance. Moreover, co-treatment with R27T
and a cFLIP inhibitor was found to reduce the growth of
R27T-resistant cells in vitro and in vivo.
It is notable that R27T has significant anti-cancer
effects in OVCAR-3 and MCF-7 cells (Figure 1A)
because several previous reports have described the antiproliferative effects of IFN-β in OVCAR-3 and MCF-7
cells [11, 12]. Consistent with our results, previous reports
showed that IFN-β treatment did not induce apoptosis in
HeLa cells [12, 13]. TOV-21G cells have a Janus kinase
(JAK1)-truncating mutation [14], which suggests that
R27T does not induce IFN signaling, enabling it to exert a
dominant-negative effect on apoptosis (Figure 1C).
Unlike the nature of its anti-cancer effects, R27T
increased ISRE luciferase activity and expression levels
of apoptotic mediators in both OVCAR-3 and HeLa cells
(Figure 2). It has been reported that IFN-stimulated gene
factor-3 (ISGF-3) can bind to ISRE in OVCAR-3 or HeLa
cells treated with type I IFNs [15, 16]. Furthermore, the
IFN-β-induced expression of interferon-stimulated genes
(ISGs; e.g., DR4, FAS, TNF-α, and TRAIL) has been
correlated with death receptor-mediated activation of
apoptotic signals [17–20]. Regardless of the activation
of IFN and death receptor signaling pathways, there
were significant differences in caspase activity between
R27T-treated sensitive and -resistant cell lines (Figure
3A-3D). The caspase cascade can be initiated through
either intrinsic (mitochondrial-mediated) or extrinsic
(death receptor-mediated) apoptosis pathway. The
extrinsic apoptosis pathway is triggered by ligand binding
to death receptors, resulting in caspase-8 activation.
Activated caspase-8 then directly cleaves effector
caspases (caspase-3, -6, -7) or activates the intrinsic
apoptotic pathway via cleavage of Bcl-2 homology (BH3)interacting domain death agonist, resulting in caspase-9
activation. Activated caspase-9 then triggers apoptosis
by activating effector caspases [21]. In this study, we
found that the anti-cancer efficacy of R27T in OVCAR-3
cells was inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor, zVAD,
which prevented R27T-mediated anti-proliferative effects
(Figure 3E), and has been used to study the mechanisms

Combined treatment with R27T and TBB
suppresses in vivo tumor growth
We next examined the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy
of R27T in an OVCAR-3 tumor xenograft model. The
tumor volumes were significantly smaller (Figure 6A) and
tumor weights were lower (Figure 6B and 6C) in mice
treated with R27T than in those treated with the control
vehicle. The tumor weight of R27T-treated group was
3.1-fold lower than that of the vehicle. When we further
examined the anti-tumor effects of intraperitoneally coadministered R27T and TBB in HeLa tumor-bearing mice,
significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed in
the R27T/TBB co-treated group (Figure 6E). The tumor
weights were lowest in the mice co-treated with R27T
and TBB, which exhibited a 3-fold reduction in tumor
weight compared with that of R27T-treated mice (Figure
6F and 6G). In keeping with these tumor-growth inhibition
effects, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) analysis showed population of
apoptotic cells in OVCAR-3 tumor tissues of R27T-treated
mice (Figure 6D) or HeLa tumor tissues of R27T plus
TBB- treated mice (Figure 6H) was higher than that in the
control-treated group. Furthermore, a significant decrease

underlying the effects of IFN-β in various cancer cell lines
[22, 23].
In the absence of R27T, cFLIPL and cFLIPS
proteins were more highly expressed in R27T-resistant
cells than in R27T-sensitive cells, thereby blocking
caspase-8 activation (Supplementary Figure 1 and Figure
3D). Moreover, when HeLa cells were treated with R27T
for 72 h, an increase in cFLIPS expression was observed
(Figure 3D). cFLIP is known to be a major anti-apoptotic
regulator and resistance factor that inhibits death receptorinduced apoptosis in a wide range of human malignancies
[24, 25]. Recruitment of cFLIP to death-inducing signaling
complex (DISC) prevents the processing and activation of
procaspase-8 [24, 25]. Although 15 different isoforms of
cFLIP have been currently identified, cFLIPL and cFLIPS
are the major anti-apoptotic proteins [26, 27]. cFLIPL is
structurally similar to procaspase-8 but lacks the catalytic
cysteine residue and proteolytic activity, while cFLIPS
only contains two N-terminal death effector domains
[28]. In addition, cFLIPL forms heterodimeric complex
with procaspase-8, resulting in the partial activation of
caspase-8. Recruitment of cFLIPS to the DISC impedes
homodimerization and activation of procaspase-8,
preventing the downstream apoptosis cascade [29].
Notably, in an earlier report, TRAIL-induced upregulation
of cFLIPS was shown to increase the survival of non-small
cell lung carcinoma cells by reducing TRAIL sensitivity,
whereas the cFLIPL isoform did not appear to be involved
in TRAIL-induced apoptosis [30]. A previous report
showed that cFLIPL triggered FAS-induced apoptosis
upon strong receptor stimulation, while the overexpression
of cFLIPS inhibited caspase-8 activation even upon
expanded stimulation of FAS receptor [31]. Previous
reports provided evidence that cFLIPS expression was
significantly upregulated 72 h after TRAIL treatment
[30], and cFLIPS expression was linked to the calcineurin/
NFAT pathway in T-cells [32]. NFAT can bind to cFLIP
promoter, thereby promoting the expression of cFLIPS
[32]. Activation of NF-κB enhanced histone deacetylase
1, reduced p300 and histone acetylation, and prevented
the recruitment of NFAT to cFLIP promoter, resulting in
the transcriptional repression of cFLIP [33]. The results of
this study as well as previous studies suggest that R27T
resistance of tumor cells might result from increased
cFLIPS expression.
Downregulation of cFLIP by siRNA or TBB
rendered R27T-resistant cells sensitive to R27T-mediated
apoptosis and was accompanied by cleavage of caspase-8
(Figure 4 and 5). Since the upregulation of cFLIP impairs
caspase-8 activation, siRNA-mediated silencing of cFLIP
could logically be predicted to promote the apoptosis of
R27T-resistant cells. A previous report showed that the
downregulation of cFLIP gene expression increased the
pro-apoptotic effect of type I IFNs [34]. In addition, cotreatment with TRAIL and a cFLIP-targeting siRNA has
been recently reported to enhance the apoptosis of TRAILwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

resistant tumor cells via caspase-8 activation [35, 36].
Moreover, combined treatment with TRAIL and TBB was
shown to increase the TRAIL sensitivity on cancer cells
[37, 38]. Thus, we chose cFLIP siRNA and CK-2 inhibitor,
TBB, for combination therapy with R27T.
In conclusion, this study is the first to show that the
induction of apoptosis in cancer cells by R27T involves
a cFLIP-mediated mechanism. We further suggest that
it may be possible to enhance the therapeutic efficacy
of R27T significantly by downregulating cFLIP. Thus,
combination therapy with R27T and cFLIP inhibitors may
be an attractive strategy for overcoming R27T resistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction of plasmids
In order to establish a cell line that transiently
express cFLIP-short (cFLIPS), pCMV3-cFLIPS was
constructed. The cFLIPS gene synthesized by Bioneer
(Daejeon, Korea) was excised with KpnI (Thermo
Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and XbaI (Thermo
Scientific) and inserted to pCMV3. The pCMV-cFLIPlong (cFLIPL) was purchased by Sino Biologinal (Beijing,
China).

Cell lines and culture condition
Human ovarian carcinoma (OVCAR-3, TOV-21G),
human cervical cancer (HeLa), and human breast cancer
(MCF-7) cell lines were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA).
OVCAR-3, HeLa, and MCF-7 cells were cultured in
RPMI-1640 (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 100 units/
mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (HyClone).
TOV-21G cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of
M199/MCDB medium (HyClone) containing 15% fetal
bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37ºC in a humidified
5% CO2 atmosphere.

Cell viability and apoptosis assays
The in vitro anti-proliferation efficacy of R27T
(provided from Abion Inc. [3]) was tested using two
different cell viability assays. OVCAR-3, MCF-7,
HeLa, or TOV-21G cells were seeded to 96-well plates,
cultured overnight, and then treated with or without
various concentration of R27T for 24, 48, or 72 h. For
combination treatment, OVCAR-3 or HeLa cells were
treated with R27T (100 ng/mL), zVAD (50 μM; R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and/or TBB (10 μM;
Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK), alone or in combination,
for 48 or 72 h. ON-TARGET plus human cFLIP siRNA
set was supplied by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, US).

sequential treatment with R27T and cFLIP siRNA, HeLa
cells were transfected with 10 nM of scrambled siRNA
(Dharmacon) or cFLIP siRNA for 24 h. Thereafter, the
siRNA-containing culture medium was removed and
cells were cultured in fresh medium containing R27T
(100 ng/mL). Cell viability was assessed using a watersoluble tetrazolium (WST) colorimetric assay (Ez-Cytox;
Daeil Lab Service, Seoul, Korea) or a live cell-staining
assay (LIVE/DEAD Viability Assay; Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR, USA). For the WST assay, 10 μL of WST
reagent was added to each well, the plates were incubated
for 1 h, and absorbance was measured at 430 nm using a
microplate reader (TECAN, Durham, NC, USA). For livecell analysis, calcein-AM was treated to cells for 10 min
and the fluorescence of calcein-AM (which is specifically
taken up by live cells) was analyzed using a fluorescence
microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).
R27T-induced apoptosis was measured using a
fluorescence isothiocyanate (FITC) Annexin V/PI kit (BD
Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA). Annexin V can detect
apoptotic cells by binding to phosphatidylserine and PI
is used for nuclear DNA staining. Cells are Annexin V
positive and PI negative in early apoptosis, while cells
are both Annexin V and PI positive in late apoptosis
[39]. Briefly, cells were harvested, washed twice with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in
100 μL of binding buffer (10 mM HEPES/NaOH [pH
7.4], 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2). Five microliters
of FITC Annexin V or PI solution were added to each
sample, and the samples were incubated for 15 min at
room temperature in the dark. The reaction was stopped by
adding 400 μL of binding buffer. The stained samples were
run on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences)
and analyzed with the Cell QuestPro (BD Biosciences).

LTX reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). At 24 h
post-transfection, cells were treated with the indicated
concentrations of R27T, and after an additional 16 h, the
activities of firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase were
determined using a microplate reader (TECAN).

Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
OVCAR-3 or HeLa cells were treated with
100 ng/mL R27T, total RNA was isolated using a
Hybrid-RTM kit (GeneAll, Seoul, Korea), and the
RNA was reverse transcribed to complementary
DNA (cDNA) using a Transcriptor First Strand
cDNA synthesis kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN,
USA). TaqMan qRT-PCR was performed using the
following primers and probes: DR4 (forward primer,
5'-GGGTCCACAAGACCTTCAAGT-3'; reverse primer,
5'-TGCAGCTGAGCTAGGTACGA-3'; and probe,
5'-FAM-TCCTGCTG-TAMRA-3'), FAS (forward primer,
5'-ATGGCCAATTCTGCCATAAG-3'; reverse primer,
5'-TGACTGTGCAGTCCCTAGCTT-3'; and probe,
5'-FAM-TCCTCCAG-TAMRA-3'), TNF-α (forward
primer, 5'-GACAAGCCTGTAGCCCATGT-3'; reverse
primer, 5'-TCTCAGCTCCACGCCATT-3'; and probe,
5'-FAM-CCTCCTGG-TAMRA-3'), and TRAIL (forward
primer, 5'-CCTCAGAGAGTAGCAGCTCACA-3'; reverse
primer, 5'-CAGAGCCTTTTCATTCTTGGA-3'; and probe,
5'-FAM-CAGAGGAA-TAMRA-3'). The following cycling
conditions were applied: 95°C for 10 min; followed by 50
cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 55°C for 30 s; and a final cycle
at 40°C for 30 s. The primers and probes were designed
by the Universal Probe Library Assay Design Center
(Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), and qRT-PCR
was performed on a LightCycler 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany). The 2(-ΔΔC(T)) method was used
to compute relative mRNA expression levels [40].

Antibodies and western blot analysis
OVCAR-3 or HeLa cells treated with R27T (100
ng/mL), cFLIP siRNA (10 nM), and/or TBB (10 μM),
alone or in combination, were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer
(150 mM sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 2
mM EDTA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor
mixture (Roche). The lysed cells were incubated for 20
min on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g
for 15 min. The supernatant was collected, and protein
concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay
kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Twenty micrograms of protein were resolved
by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinyl
difluoride membrane (PVDF; BioRad, CA, USA). The
PVDF membranes were blocked in TBS-Tween20 buffer
containing 5% skim milk and incubated with primary

Luciferase reporter assay
Reporter gene assays were performed using a Dual
Luciferase Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
OVACAR-3 or HeLa cells were seeded to 12-well
plates and incubated overnight at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were then cotransfected with 0.4 μg of a firefly luciferase-encoding
reporter plasmid containing the interferon stimulated
response element (ISRE) and 0.3 μg of pTK-RLuc
plasmid containing the Renilla luciferase reporter gene.
Transfections were performed with the Lipofectamine

antibodies at 4°C overnight. The following primary
antibodies were utilized: anti-FAS, anti-TNF-α, antiTRAIL, anti-caspase-8, anti-caspase-3, anti-caspase-9,
anti-p65, anti-p-p65 (all from Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA, USA), anti-cFLIPS (AG Scientific, CA,
USA), anti-DR4 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-cFLIPL,
anti-nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1c (NFAT1c) and
anti-β-actin (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA). The blots were then incubated for 1 h
with anti-mouse IgG-HRP (ThermoFisher Scientific)
or anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (ThermoFisher Scientific)
secondary antibodies, and immunoreactive proteins were
visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents
(GE Healthcare). For immunoprecipitation, cells were
lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris [pH 7.5],
150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, and protease
inhibitor mixture (Roche) for 1h. The lysed cells were
clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min.
The supernatant was collected and protein concentration
was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Thermo
Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
One milligram of protein was precleared in the presence
of 20 μl Dynabead protein G (Thermo Scientific) for 1h
at 4ºC. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected
and incubated with 1 μg of anti-caspase-8 antibody (Acris
Antibodies, Herford, Germany) in the presence of 20 μL
Dynabead protein G (Thermo Scientific). The precipitated
beads were washed 3 times in lysis buffer and then the
precipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting.

model, the mice were intraperitoneally administered three
times per week for 4 weeks with either vehicle or TBB
(10 mg/kg) or/and R27T (1 mg/kg). In the co-treatment
group, mice were treated with TBB and R27T alternately
every day for 4 weeks. Tumor size was measured by
caliper every other day in two dimensions, and the tumor
volume was calculated using the following formula; tumor
volume (mm3) = (short diameter)2 x (long diameter) x
0.5. For histological evaluation, tumor tissues were
extracted, weighed, sectioned, and stained with TUNEL.
In addition, expression level of cFLIP was determined by
immunohistochemical staining HeLa tumor tissue section
(4 μm thick) with an anti-cFLIP antibody (AG Scientific).

Statistics
Statistics were conducted by analysis of variance
(ANOVA), with the Student-Newman-Keuls test. The
SigmaStat software (Systat Software, Richmond, CA,
USA) was employed, and P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Caspase-8 activity analysis
Caspase-8 activity was measured using a Caspase-Glo
8 assay kit (Promega). OVCAR-3 or HeLa cells were treated
with R27T (100 ng/mL), cFLIP siRNA (10 nM), and/or TBB
(10 μM) alone or in combination, and then lysed on ice in
phosphate buffered saline containing 1% NP40 and 0.1%
SDS. Ten micrograms of cell lysate in a 50 μL total volume
was resuspended in 50 μL of Caspase-Glo reagent and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The luminescence
produced upon cleavage of the luminogenic substrate (which
contained the caspase-8 cleavage site, LETD) was measured
for each sample using a microplate reader (TECAN).
