ABSTRACT
Sunburns and especially sub-sunburn chronic UV exposure are associated with
increased risk of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Here we focus on a possible
difference in tumor initiation from a single severe-sunburn dose (on day 1, 21 hairless
mice) and from an equal dose fractionated into very low sub-sunburn doses not
causing any (growth-promoting) epidermal hyperplasia (40 days daily exposure,
n=20). From day 47 all mice received 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)
applications (2x/wk) for 20 weeks to promote tumor development within the lifetime
of the animals. After the sub-sunburn regimen sparse DNA damage-retaining basal
cells (quiescent stem cells, QSCs) remained in the non-hyperplastic epidermis. These
cells were forced to divide by TPA. After discontinuation of TPA tumors regressed
and disappeared in the ‘sunburn group’ but persisted and grew in the ‘sub-sunburn
group’ (0.06 vs 2.50 SCCs and precursors ≥4mm/mouse after 280 days, p=0.03).
As the tumors carried no mutations in p53, H/K/N-Ras and Notch1/2, these ‘usual
suspects’ were not involved in the UV-driven tumor initiation. Although we could
not selectively eliminate QSCs (unknown phenotype) to establish causality, our data
suggest that forcing specifically DNA damage-retaining QSCs to divide – with high
mutagenic risk - gives rise to persisting (mainly ‘in situ’) skin carcinomas.

template, which may result in cytosine (C) → thymidine
(T) at sites of adjacent pyrimidines and CC→ TT
transitions. These specific transitions are considered UV
signature mutations [9, 10]. In SCCs and BCCs the P53
tumor suppressor genes bear these UV signature mutations
[10, 11]. A suitable experimental model for SCCs has been
established by chronic (daily) exposure of hairless mice to
UV radiation [12]; here the p53 gene is targeted leading to
the UV signature mutations [13], in line with human SCCs.
In contrast to two-stage chemical skin carcinogenesis [14],
the UV tumors bear no H-Ras mutations [15]. Our group
found that microscopic foci with overexpression of p53
protein in mutant conformation (detected with antibody
PAb240) were already present in UV-exposed mice long
before the tumors appeared [16–18]. Such ‘p53 patches‘
have also been found in sun-exposed human skin, which
after micro-dissection were found to harbor UV-signature
mutations in P53 genes [19, 20].

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of skin carcinomas has strongly
increased since the 1970-s by an average of about 4%
per year in NW Europe, to a staggering 100 to 200 new
cases per 105 persons per year, despite the temperate
climate [1–3]. UV radiation plays an important role in the
etiology of skin carcinomas, both basal cell carcinomas
(BCCs) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) [4, 5].
Kennedy et al. [6] showed that sunburns as well as
chronic sun exposure are associated with an increased
risk of developing SCCs.
UV radiation preferentially damages sites of
neighboring pyrimidine bases in a DNA strand, forming
dimers between these bases: either cyclobutane pyrimidine
dimers (CPDs) or 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs) [7, 8].
These photo lesions cause a distortion of the DNA helix,
rendering DNA polymerase unable to read the DNA

The essential cancer traits appear to develop in
stages in the neoplastic cell [21], which takes time:
cancer is therefore predominantly a disease of the elderly.
Hence, the targeted cell in carcinogenesis needs to reside
in the body for a long time in order to acquire a series
of alterations (gene mutations) resulting in malignant
growth. Furthermore, the cell probably needs to divide for
fixation of mutations (most likely to arise in replication of
damaged DNA) and to pass on the mutations to daughter
cells. These requirements of long term residence combined
with cell division point at stem cells as likely targeted
candidates [22, 23].
Mitchell et al. [24] found that CPDs accumulated
in some cells located in the basal layer of the epidermis
in the course of chronic low level UV radiation and these
cells retained CPDs long after discontinuation of UV
exposures (> 50 days). Such cells were found to occur in
human skin too [25]. If UV exposure caused significant
epidermal hyperplasia (e.g. after a sunburn dose), the
CPD-retaining epidermal cells were no longer observed
[25]. Our group confirmed that at low level chronic UV
exposure (1/7 of the threshold dose for a sunburn/day for
40 days) in absence of hyperplasia CPDs accumulated in
long-residing non-dividing skin cells, i.e., in some basal
cells and in fibroblasts in the upper dermis. And we went
on to show that persistent quiescent (BrdU-retaining)
epidermal stem cells in the basal layer accumulated and
retained UV-induced CPDs while neighboring cells did
not (because of cell division and epidermal turnover) [26].
The CPD-retaining basal cells (CRBCs) were found to be
repair proficient, since 6-4PPs did not accumulate [26].
CRBCs could be forced to proliferate by application of
12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) while the
CPD-retaining fibroblasts showed no apparent reaction
[25, 27]. With repeated TPA applications the accumulated
DNA damage in CRBCs was gradually dispersed over
daughter cells, and the CRBCs disappeared.
As mentioned above, both sunburns and chronic
(sub-sunburn) UV exposure play a role in SCC
development in humans [6] but the life-long accumulated
UV dose as from chronic (sub-sunburn) exposure appears
to be the major exogenous risk factor [28]. Considering
also that a severe sunburn exposure induces hyperplasia
and no CRBCs (> 4 days after exposure [25]) whereas
the same dose fractionated in daily exposures of 1/7 of
the sunburn threshold dose does induce CRBC and no
hyperplasia, we set out to investigate the effect of nonhyperplastigenic sub-sunburn dose fractionation on skin
carcinogenesis. To this end, one group of hairless mice
(sunburn group n=21) received a single severe sunburn
dose on day 1 while another group (sub-sunburn group)
received the same total dose in 40 daily fractions (each 1/7
of the sunburn threshold dose) to induce CPD-retaining
cells. After one week pause both groups were subsequently
treated with TPA for 20 weeks to raise skin tumors within
the lifetime of the mice (either a single high UV exposure
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or tumor promotion alone does not give rise to tumors in
hairless mice [29]; further information in Materials and
Methods); the time line of the experimental protocol for
both groups is given in Supplementary Figure S1.
The tumors were scrutinized for (dis-)similarities
with tumors induced by two-stage chemocarcinogensis
(mostly papillomas with H-Ras mutations instead
of SCCs) and skin carcinogenesis by chronic UV
exposure (i.e. life-long daily sub-sunburn exposure
resulting in SCCs and actinic keratosis as benign
precursors, both types of lesions with UV-signature
mutations in p53).

RESULTS
CPDs accumulated in isolated epidermal basal
cells and in fibroblasts after low dose UV
As observed in our previous experiment [27],
mice in the ‘sub-sunburn group’ that received the low
dose fractions of UV spread over 40 days did not show
any immediate observable effects, whereas mice in the
‘sunburn group’ that received the unfractionated high dose
of UV showed severe sunburn which resolved in 2 weeks.
From day 47 onward both groups of mice received dorsal
TPA treatment twice a week for 20 weeks. TPA treatment
induced epidermal cell proliferation shown by epidermal
hyperplasia (Figure 1C+1D) and, as we have shown
earlier, an increase in Ki67+ epidermal cells, but not in
(CPD-retaining) fibroblasts in the upper dermis [27]. Mice
from both groups showed scaling of the skin after TPA
treatment. We observed CPD-retaining cells in the subsunburn group (Figure 1A). Most of the epidermal CPDretaining cells were located in the basal layer, i.e., CRBCs,
(1.7% of basal cells heavily stained for CPDs). Upon TPA
treatment CRBCs were lost and more CPD-containing
cells were found suprabasally (Figure 1C, arrows). CPDretaining cells were also observed in the dermis of these
mice (Figure 1A+1C) but these cells showed no apparent
reaction to TPA, no cell morphology of proliferation/
mitosis or apoptosis (conform our earlier experiment
where we stained for Ki67 and activated caspase 3 [27];
these fibroblasts do eventually lose the CPDs apparently
by slow repair). We did not observe any CPD-retaining
cells in mice that received a single UV overexposure
(Figure 1B+1D).

Fractionated sub-sunburn UV exposure followed
by TPA-induced sparse p53 patches
Skin samples were taken after 8 weeks of TPA
treatment to check for (mutant) p53-overexpressing foci
(‘p53 patches’). Immunohistochemical staining was
performed on epidermal sheets using both the CM-5
antibody (detecting wild type and mutant p53) and
the PAb240 antibody (detecting only mutant p53). No

p53 patches were observed in the sunburn group using
either of the antibodies. In the sub-sunburn group we
found CM5+ patches at a frequency of 3.8 patches/cm2
(SEM 1.6), yielding about 1 patch per 5000 CRBCs.
Using the PAb240 antibody we found 60% fewer
patches expressing mutant-p53 (see Supplementary
Figure S2).

pedunculated, cauliflower-shaped classical papillomas
contained a focus suspect of Bowenoid changes).

Tumor-free survival for AK/SCC was
significantly shorter after fractionated
UV exposure
The percentage of tumor-free mice with time is
shown in Figure 2 for different threshold sizes of AK/
SCCs and for papillomas. For AK/SCC tumors ≥2 mm
there was a clear difference between the sunburn and
the sub-sunburn group (p=0.0006); all mice in the subsunburn group developed a tumor ≥2mm whereas some
mice in the sunburn group remained tumor free. Also, for
the tumors ≥4mm there was a clear difference between
the two groups (p=0.03). More mice in the sub-sunburn
group developed AK/SCCs ≥ 4mm. For the papillomas
(very small in number) we did not find any significant
differences.
Gender differences in UV carcinogenesis have been
reported [32], but we found no significant differences
in tumor-free survivals between males and females
(Supplementary Figure S3).

Tumor appearance and pathology
Upon TPA treatment tumors occurred in both groups
but after discontinuation of TPA application tumors
persisted to grow only in the sub-sunburn group and
regressed in the sunburn group.
The histopathological analyses largely confirmed
our initial macroscopic observations. The sessile based,
endophytically growing tumors, which we provisionally
qualified as “non-papilloma” tumors (30% cutaneous
horns), were apparently all grades of hyperkeratotic tumors
ranging from benign actinic keratosis (AK)-like lesions
(18/41 benign) through Bowenoid tumors (carcinomas in
situ, 17/41) up to malignant squamous cell carcinomas,
SCCs, and 1 basal cell carcinoma, BCC (5/41 malignant);
see Table 1 for a comparison with tumor pathology from
an older study [30] with chronic, life-long daily UV
exposure in which clearly more progression to SCC was
observed. In the remainder of this article we will refer to
these tumors as AK/SCCs [31]. Only one out of these 41
tumors was not AK/SCC but diagnosed as an inverted
papilloma. Exophytically growing tumors (n=7) were
confirmed to be papillomas (of which 2 long persisting

Tumor yields showed non-regressing carcinomas
only after fractionated UV exposure
After discontinuation of the TPA treatment AK/
SCCs ≥ 2 mm went into regression, as reflected in
Figure 3 (A) by a drop in tumor yield. Almost all tumors
in the sunburn group went into complete regression,

No difference in yields of papillomas after
different UV treatments

while most of the tumors in the sub-sunburn group
persisted. For the tumors ≥4 mm we observed an even
more distinct difference at day 280. In the sunburn group
virtually no AK/SCC grew out to this size, while in the
sub-sunburn group these tumors persisted and grew after
discontinuation of the TPA regimen (0.06 vs 2.50 AK/
SCC ≥4 mm, p=0.03; again, no gender differences, see
Supplementary Figure S4).

Next to AK/SCC tumors we also observed
papillomas (growing exophytically) in small numbers.

and ≥ 4mm, respectively. At both thresholds there was no
clear difference between the two groups (n.s.). The yield

and after a week subjected to 2 TPA applications per week for a period of 20 weeks.

of papillomas was 4-6 fold lower than that of AK/SCCs,
with a maximum of 1/mouse for the ≥2 mm tumors and a
maximum of 0.6/mouse for the ≥ 4mm tumors, (for AK/
SCCs 6 and 2.5/mouse, respectively). In contrast to AK/
SCCs papillomas did not appear to regress in the sunburn
group after discontinuation of the TPA regimen. We did

could concern reactive wild-type p53 expression (data
not shown). We found two papillomas mutated in H-Ras
codon 12 (G>A), (1 from each group). Furthermore we
found one mutation in H-Ras codon 13 (G>T) in an AK/
SCC from the sub-sunburn group. No mutations were
found in N- and K-Ras.
In follow-up of this paucity of mutations in p53 and
RAS, we decided to investigate Notch (frequently mutated in
human SCC, [33, 34]). First, tumors were stained using an
antibody against cleaved Notch1, i.e. recognizing the Notch
1 intracellular domain (Nicd) which relocates to the nucleus
up on activation. Nicd expression is affected by mutations in
Notch1 [33]. Our staining (method given in Supplementary
Information) showed highly variable Nicd expression in the
tumors, and was not conclusive on possible mutations. Next,
we sequenced 10 tumors (6 from the sub-sunburn group,
4 from the sunburn group) for mutations in Notch1 and
Notch2 (focusing on domains most often affected in human
cutaneous SCCs [33, 34]; see Supplementary Information).
None were found.

Lack of p53, Ras and Notch mutations in AK/
SCCs
Samples of tumors (22 AK/SCCs and 3 papillomas),
mainly from the sub-sunburn group (17/25), were
analyzed for mutations in p53 and Ras genes (H-, Kand N-Ras). No mutations were found in p53 (exons
4-8). Staining with CM5 showed only sparse cells in the
tumor masses overexpressing p53 (except for 1 AK/SCC
out of 34 that was abundantly positive but without p53
mutation). Considering the absence of p53 mutations this

DISCUSSION

expressed suprabasally in TPA driven hyperplasia; data not
shown). Thus, we could not identify a specific phenotypic
marker of these cells which could be exploited to eliminate
these cells specifically (e.g. by induction of a transgene for
diphtheria toxin). Such an eliminatory intervention could
serve to proof the suspected causal role of CPD-loaded
QSCs in raising persistent SCCs.
The retention of UV-induced DNA damage in
quiescent stem cells is reminiscent of the retention of
chemical DNA adducts in quiescent cells as the tumorinitiating step in a two-stage regimen of chemical skin
carcinogenesis (i.e., tumor initiation by a genotoxic agent
followed by “tumor promotion” by repeated applications
of a cell proliferation inducing agent, such as TPA) [39].
This regimen gives rise to PCR-detectable oncogenic
H-ras mutations one week after tumor initiation, months
before the occurrence of skin tumors carrying such
mutations [40].
Only in the sub-sunburn group, corresponding with
induction of CPD-retaining cells, we found clear, but rare,
p53-overexpressing and p53-mutant clusters of cells (“p53
patches”) long before onset of tumors, albeit in very low
numbers. This is somewhat in contrast with earlier results
[27] where no p53-mutant patches could be detected, but
high numbers of small wild-type p53 expressing patches
were found, speculated to reflect a reaction of TPA-driven
cells to proliferative stress from DNA damage. This
discrepancy is most likely attributable to a difference
in techniques (detection in epidermal sheets or cross
sections) and sensitivity (difference in antigen retrieval),
despite using the same antibodies.
Only in the sub-sunburn group we found CRBCs
and p53 patches. As the regimen of 1/7 MED/day for 40
days is unlikely to induce p53-mutant patches [17], this
suggests that some CRBCs attained p53 mutations after
TPA-induced proliferation and grew out to p53 patches.
But the p53 patches were very sparse (3.8/cm2 on
average), and none of the ensuing persistent (in situ) skin
carcinomas carried any p53 mutations. Very much in
contrast to what we found earlier with life-long chronic
exposure of SKH1 hairless mice which gave rise to
multitudes of p53 patches and subsequently carcinomas
with abundant p53 mutations with the “UV signature”
(>70% of tumors) [13], also at low daily doses [18].
This lack of p53 mutations could conceivably hamper
progression to malignancy (high percentage of in situ
SCCs/Bowenoid tumors and low percentage of SCCs in
present experiment in comparison to earlier experiments
with chronic, life-long daily UV exposure, Table 1) [30].
Of human SCCs, 50 – 70 % have been reported to
carry UV-related P53 mutations [10, 41, 42], and similar
percentages in AKs [41]. But in some studies much lower
percentages have been reported in SCCs (e.g. 15% [43])
and in “low grade” AKs (7% [44]). NOTCH genes proved
to be even more abundantly UV-mutated than P53 [33,
34]. The lack of p53 mutations in the current experiment

In this study we showed that there is a difference in
tumor initiation by a single UV overexposure compared
to the same total dose delivered in very small subsunburn dose fractions: only in the latter case tumors
grew persistently after 20 weeks of TPA treatment. In
absence of epidermal hyperplasia during exposure, both
UV regimens should have produced the same initial
DNA damage (CPDs), but spreading this damage over
small daily aliquots was apparently linked to the ultimate
yield of persistent (in situ) SCCs. In contrast to the single
sunburn UV exposure, the fractionated sub-sunburn UV
dose resulted in CPD-retaining skin cells which persisted
over a week after the last UV exposure. These stationary,
non-dividing cells lagging behind in repair of CPDs
had apparently accumulated part of the undetectably
small daily aliquots of CPDs. Besides fibroblasts in the
upper dermis, sparse basal cells in the epidermis showed
retention of CPDs; in an earlier study we demonstrated
the latter cells (CPD-retaining basal cells, CRBCs) to be
quiescent stem cells (QSCs) [26]. TPA induced division
of these CPD-retaining epidermal cells, but evoked no
discernable response in the CPD-retaining fibroblasts
(see Figure 1 and our earlier study [27]). Forcing the
CRBCs with their high CPD loads to proliferate is likely
to increase the risk of mutations and thus have a special
bearing on epidermal UV carcinogenesis. In a natural
situation the forced proliferation may be evoked by an
irritant or a mild sunburn inducing (transient) hyperplasia
[25].
With regard to AK/SCC, our data show that a
severe sunburn from a single overdose appears to be less
hazardous than spreading the same dose over multiple
small exposures. This finding appears to be in line with
the older finding that single weekly exposures are less
effective in inducing SCCs than daily doses mounting up
to the same weekly dose [35]. This could be related to the
extent to which quiescent stem cells are activated in the
hyperplastic response and the speed at which CPDs are
removed in the epidermal turnover.
The daily UV dose fractions in our experiment were
low enough not to induce any proliferation of quiescent
stem cells and hyperplasia, as can be seen in Figure 1A.
The undetectably small aliquots of CPDs induced daily
were being lost mostly in epidermal turnover. This DNA
damage only accumulated in long residing (quiescent stem)
cells if the repair lagged behind – which it apparently did
for CPDs but not for 6-4 photoproducts [26]. In literature
there are several markers described for the long-residing
non-dividing QSCs, e.g. Wif-1 [36], Lrig1 [37] and Dll1
[38]. We checked for double staining with anti-CPD to see
if they would co-localize (see Supplementary Table S2 on
antibodies used). However, these markers either did not
label interfollicular basal cells at all in mice (Lrig1+, Dll1)
or did not double stain (Wif1, which was predominantly

is evidently due to early termination of the UV regimen,
which might also explain the lack of mutations in Notch.
This apparently also resulted in only a few p53 mutant
clones (p53 patches). Considering the overall high
percentages of human SCCs with UV signature mutations
in P53 and NOTCH, one is led to infer that most of these
tumors are induced by life-long, or at least decades of,
chronic UV exposure. Even in temperate climate with
low ambient UV, high frequencies of UV-related P53 and
NOTCH mutations were found in sun-exposed adult skin
[45, 46].
We have earlier shown that in contrast to chronic
UVB exposure, chronic UVA exposure of SKH1 hairless
mice induced SCCs of which a large majority (85%)
lacked p53 mutations [47]. Like low level UVB, UVA
exposure appears to be much less effective in stimulating
cell proliferation and hyperplasia than higher level UVB
[48], and it may therefore also be targeted more at QSCs
and deeper residing fibroblasts.
The AK/SCCs initiated by low level daily UVB
exposure (40 days) – associated with CPD-retaining skin
cells – and promoted to grow out by repeated applications
of TPA – specifically stimulating CRBCs - differ from
earlier SCCs induced by life-long chronic UVB exposure
in that they harbor no p53 and Notch mutations, and
they differ from chemically initiated and TPA-promoted
tumors in that they harbor virtually no oncogenic
(H-)Ras mutations. Thus, there appears to be another as
yet unknown tumor initiator/driver which may also be
involved in the earliest stages of skin carcinogenesis by
life-long chronic UV exposure.
Histopathology (Table 1) was mainly based on
tumor samples from mice sacrificed at the end of the
experiment and from a few mice sacrificed earlier. Hence,
most of the samples were from persistently growing
tumors from the sub-sunburn group, mostly (in situ) SCCs
and precursor AKs. As most of the tumors regressed in the
sunburn group, few tumors could be analyzed of which
most from a mouse sacrificed early, 5 out of 7 AKs (see
footnote Table 1). The low percentage of SCCs and high
percentage of Bowenoid tumors (in situ SCCs) in the subsunburn group in comparison with earlier experiments
with chronic exposures (Table 1) suggests that tumor
progression stagnated in the ‘in situ’ stage without
further UV exposure, despite TPA-driven outgrowth of
the tumor. As virtually all of the suspected AK/SCCs,
i.e., endophytically growing tumors, regressed upon
discontinuation of the TPA regimen in the sunburn group,
we have very little information on the histopathology of
these regressing tumors. AKs are, however, known to
regress (e.g. if no longer subjected to sun or UV exposure)
[49, 50]. The AK/SCC-like tumors ≥ 3 mm that regressed
are not likely to have been truly malignant SCCs. Besides
AKs, they may also have been benign keratoacanthomas
which are hard to distinguish from SCCs but, unlike SCCs,
are known to regress spontaneously in man [51].

Acute overexposure and especially chronic
exposure to (solar) UV radiation are associated with the
development of squamous cell carcinomas. The present
study shows that a single sunburn dose differs in initiating
epidermal tumors from an equal dose fractionated into
sub-sunburn exposures: the latter results in non-regressing
tumors whereas the tumors from the single exposure went
into regression upon cessation of tumor promotion by TPA
treatment. Interestingly, the initiation of non-regressing
tumors was associated with DNA damage-retaining
QSCs in the epidermis which were forced to divide by
TPA treatment. Surprisingly, none of the persistent skin
tumors showed mutations in the common driver genes, i.e.
no mutations in p53, Notch and Ras. We infer that none
of these common driver mutations were involved in the
UV-driven tumor initiation. Although the as yet unknown
tumor-initiating mutations may have been forced to occur
by TPA-induced proliferation of DNA damage-retaining
cells, they may also constitute the earliest tumor initiation
events in skin carcinogenesis by life-long chronic UV
exposure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
As legally required, the experiments were performed
with the approval of the Leiden University Medical
Centers’ ethics committee for animal experiments
(DEC10229) and executed according to EU regulations
on animal experiments (Directive 2010/63/EU).
Male and female albino Crl: SKH1-HR hairless
mice (breeding pairs from Charles River, Sulzfeld,
Germany) entered the experiment at 6-9 weeks of age. The
mice were kept individually in Macrolon type 1 cages with
standard chow and tap water ad libitum, in a room at 25 ±
2°C, 50% humidity and illuminated by yellow fluorescent
tubes (no UV radiation) in a 12 h-on-12 h-off cycle.

UV radiation
For the fractionated UV dose we used the protocol
used previously by our group [26, 27]; this regimen
yielded CPD-retaining skin cells. In short, Philips TL12/40W tubes were used (output of 54% in UV-B, 280315 nm, and 46% in UV-A, 315-400 nm). The minimal
erythemal/edemal dose (MED) was determined to be 500
J/m2 UV for SKH-1 hairless mice under these lamps. The
sub-sunburn group (n=20) received 40 days 70 J/m2 UV a
day which is equal to 0.14 MED/day. The sunburn group
(n=21) received the same dose unfractionated in a single
exposure: 2.8 kJ/m2 = 5.6 MED at day 1, a just tolerable
dose without wounding the skin. Based on an extrapolation
by using an earlier quantitative dose-response model of
ours [52] we calculated that virtually no tumors are to
be expected from such an initial total dose alone (0.006

tumors > 2 mm per mouse after 2 years; this model makes
no distinction between delivering the dose in a single
day or 40 days). In earlier studies it was indeed found
that a single high UV exposure alone did not give rise to
tumors [29] unless the exposure was high enough to cause
ulcerations where a small number of benign papillomas
occurred preferentially at the edges of scars and a few rare
carcinomas after the most extreme doses [53].
The UV overdose causes apoptosis in the basal
layer [54], transient strong epidermal hyperplasia with
increased proliferation in the basal layer, which makes it
impossible for CPD-retaining epidermal cells to persist
[25, 27]. Additional mice in each group (n=4 at each time
point) were used to assess CPDs and p53 mutant foci in
the course of the TPA treatment (see below). See for a
schematic overview of the experimental outline including
the time points of UV exposure and of taking samples

getting too high (> 0.5 cm3; also rarely) or at the end of
the experiment. Tumors were isolated from the sacrificed
animals as described below. At the end of the experiment
tumors ≥ 3 mm across were renumbered and a random
selection without further information was submitted for
pathology.

Tissue preparation
Mice were sacrificed using CO2 asphyxiation. For
anti-CPD and anti-p53 immunohistochemical stainings
dorsal skin was obtained using a template. One piece of
5x16 mm was directly frozen in liquid nitrogen, another
piece of 5x16 mm was fixed overnight in PBS-buffered
4% formaldehyde solution (Addedpharma, Oss, The
Netherlands) and embedded in paraffin. Furthermore
two skin samples of 7.5x32 mm were obtained to
prepare epidermal sheets. To separate the dermis from
the epidermis, one sample was treated with 100 μg/ml
thermolysin (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS containing 1 mM
CaCl2 (pH 7.8) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The other
sample was treated with 20 mM EDTA (Baker, Deventer,
The Netherlands) in PBS for 2 hrs at 37°C. After removal
of the dermis, epidermal sheets were stored in 70%
alcohol until further use. Tumors ≥3 mm were isolated and
one half was frozen in liquid nitrogen and the other half
was fixed in PBS-buffered 4% formaldehyde solution and
embedded in paraffin.

TPA application
From day 47 onward both groups of mice
received TPA treatment twice a week for a period of
20 weeks to promote tumor development; the TPA
also induced proliferation of quiescent stem cells. TPA
(12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, Sigma-Aldrich,
Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) was dissolved in acetone to
a concentration of 100 μg/ml. Each time, about 100 μl TPA
was applied to an area of dorsal skin of approximately 6
cm2 using a fine brush. By 20 weeks of TPA treatment
some mice had started to scratch and wound themselves.
At that point, TPA treatment was discontinued for all mice.
Scratching had occurred equally in both groups affecting
a minor dorsal area (<10%) of skin in about 15% of the
mice.

Immunohistochemistry
For anti-CPD staining frozen tissue was
embedded in Tissue-tek (Sakura Finetek Europe,
Zoeterwoude, The Netherlands) and 6 μm thick
cryosections were cut. The sections were fixed in
acetone for 10 min, and boiled for 5 min in 10 mM
citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. The
sections were slowly cooled down to 37°C and
blocked for 20 min with MilliQ water containing 50%
methanol and 0.3% H2O2. Next, the samples were
pre-incubated with 10% normal goat serum (NGS)
(Dakocytomation, Heverlee, Belgium) in PBS with 1%
BSA for 20 min followed by overnight incubation at
4°C with anti-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer antibody
(1:1000, Kamiya, Seattle, USA) in PBS containing
1% NGS and 1% BSA. Goat anti-mouse (IgG1)-biotin
(Southern Biotechnologies, Birmingham, USA) 1:200
in PBS 1%BSA was incubated 1hr at RT, followed
by incubation with avidin-biotin peroxidase complex
(Vectastain Elite, Burlingame, USA) for 45 min.
AEC (3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole Sigma-Aldrich) was
used to make the CPDs visible. The sections were
counterstained with hematoxyline (Klinipath, Duiven,
The Netherlands) and mounted in Kaisers’ Glycerin.
For p53 patch staining, epidermal sheets obtained
using EDTA or thermolysin were used and stained

Tumor assessment and pathology
For the tumor assessment, mice were inspected
every other week. Tumors were scored on maps to record
location, size and tumor type. The first tumor was scored
when present for at least two successive inspections. The
experiment was terminated after 280 days, when most
mice in the sub-sunburn group developed a substantial
tumor load. Only mice free of tumors (>4 mm) were
maintained up to 350 days to complete Kaplan-Meier plots
of tumor-free survival.
With macroscopic tumor assessment two
types of tumors were distinguished: papillomas
(exophytically growing tumors, protruding from the
skin, often pedunculated) and “non-papilloma” tumors
(endophytically growing tumors, gradually sloping at
the edges) [31]. A small number of tumors arising in
scratch-scarred skin was not taken into account and
censored. Mice were taken out of the experiment either
when in poor health (very rarely) or their tumor load was

staining for Notch 1 intracellular domain (Nicd) on tumors
are also described in the Supplementary Information.

tumor yield (average number of tumors per survivor).
Statistical significant differences in tumor-free survival
were determined by the Mantel-Cox test (in Graphpad
Prism 6). Differences in tumor yields were analyzed with
univariate two way ANOVA (testing for group and gender
differences) and with a t-test for independent samples, not
assuming equal variances for final differences between
groups (in IBM SPSS Statistics 20). Statistical significance
was set at p≤0.05. Means were given with standard error
of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise stated. Graphs were
generated in Graphpad Prism 6 and formatted in Adobe

PCR and mutation analyses of tumors (p53, Ras
and Notch)

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Frozen tumors were incubated in RNAlaterICE (Life Technologies Europe BV, Bleiswijk, The
Netherlands) overnight at -20°C; tumor material was
isolated the next day and used for DNA isolation. DNA
was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit
(Qiagen Benelux BV, Venlo, The Netherlands) according
to manufactures protocol including RNase A treatment
(Qiagen Benelux BV). The DNA concentration was
measured using a Nanodrop and about 18 ng was used
as template for PCR. The PCR was performed using the
Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase kit (Life Technologies
Europe BV) in a Bio-Rad C1000 touch thermo cycler (30
cycles three step protocol for p53 and a touchdown PCR
for Ras and Notch). Conserved domains in p53, exon 4-8
were inspected for mutations. Stretches around codons 12
and 61 in H-, K- and N- Ras were sequenced to check
for oncogenic mutations. And for Notch1 and Notch2
we looked at the mouse equivalents of mutated exons in
human [33, 34] (see also Supplementary Information).
In Supplementary Information Table S1 the
sequences and annealing temperature of the primers for
the different PCRs are given. PCR products were isolated
using the Nucleospin Gel and PCR clean-up kit (MacheryNagel, via Bioke, Leiden, The Netherlands). Products
were either isolated directly from the PCR mixture
or from a 1% agarose gel according to manufactures
protocol (for Notch the isolation was done slightly
differently, see Supplementary Information). The PCR
products were sequenced in both directions using forward
and reverse PCR primers in combination with Sanger
sequencing (Macrogen, Amsterdam, The Netherlands).
Sequences were analyzed using Mutation Surveyor
V4.0.9 software (Softgenetics LCC, State College, USA)
and sequences were double checked by visual inspection
for mutations that the program might have missed.
Mutations were scored when present in both the forward
and reverse sequence, and when the wild type signal was
correspondingly reduced.
