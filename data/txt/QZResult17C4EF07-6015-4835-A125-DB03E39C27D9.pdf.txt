ABSTRACT
Targeted therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment. Unfortunately, their
success is limited due to the development of drug resistance within the tumor,
which is an evolutionary process. Understanding how drug resistance evolves is a
prerequisite to a better success of targeted therapies. Resistance is usually explained
as a response to evolutionary pressure imposed by treatment. Thus, evolutionary
understanding can and should be used in the design and treatment of cancer. In
this article, drug-resistance to targeted therapies is reviewed from an evolutionary
standpoint. The concept of apoptosis-induced compensatory proliferation (AICP) is
developed. It is shown that AICP helps to explain some of the phenomena that are
observed experimentally in cancers. Finally, potential drug targets are suggested in
light of AICP.

TARGETED TREATMENT

lymphocytic leukemia, melanoma and non-small cell lung
cancer.

One of the most important breakthroughs in cancer
treatment was the development of a chemical compound
called imatinib mesylate, which is used in cancer therapy
since 2001 [1]. Imatinib is an inhibitor of the Abl1 kinase.
Glivec®, the drug which contains imatinib as the active
compound, has been described as a ’magic bullet’ [2]: a
treatment that works directly against a given target without
causing harm elsewhere. Owing to the vast success of
imatinib, several other kinase inhibitors have since been
developed and applied in the clinic. Overall, at the time
of writing, 30 kinase inhibitors have been approved by the
FDA to treat 15 different diseases.
Proteins other than kinases are also targeted by
non-cytotoxic oncological drugs. Examples include the
PSMB5 protein, which is part of the proteasome; and sex
hormone receptors that are important drug targets in breast
and prostate cancers. Drug targets of targeted therapies are
proteins or pathways that acquire abnormal pathogenic
properties [3]. Immunotherapy, which works by activating
the body’s own immune system against cancer, is another
form of targeted therapy. Immunotherapy drugs are
antibodies that work by inactivating proteins that downregulate cytotoxic responses against cancer cells [4].
Immunological drugs appear to be very effective against
some types of cancer including among others chronic

RESISTANCE
TREATMENT

TO

TARGETED

Unfortunately, the promise of targeted treatment is
quite often offset by the development of drug resistance [5,
6]. Resistance develops gradually within the population of
tumor cells. When resistant cells dominate the population
of the tumor, the disease ceases to react to medications
that were once very potent. Drug resistance can have
many forms. These include mutations in the drug target
that prevent the binding of the drug [7], over-expression
of proteins that compensate for the loss of the drug target
[8], and activation of redundant biological feedback
mechanisms [9, 10]. Once resistance emerges, the cancer
is much more difficult to treat. In some cases, it is possible
to switch to an inhibitor with a better resistance profile
[11]. However resistance may also develop against the
novel therapy. Immunotherapy, which is often portrayed
in the popular media as the most promising strategy in
contemporary drug design against cancer, (e.g., [12, 13]),
is also susceptible to resistance [14]. Antiangiogenic
therapy is also subject to drug resistance, through multiple
mechanisms [15]. In fact, it may even select for metastatic
clones to avoid hypoxia, thus making the cancer more

violent [16].
A key element in the understanding of resistance
mechanisms is that of clonal evolution [17, 18] within
the concept of population genetics [19, 20]. Cancer
cells are genetically unstable. They acquire additional
mutations and karyotypic modifications, that are inherited
to daughter cells. Clonal evolution gradually leads to
aggressiveness of the cancer and resistance to treatment.
Various tumor clones have different capabilities to
proliferate in the absence or presence of drugs (Figure 1),
making the genetic landscape of the tumor clones highly
dynamic [21]. Cancer has been described as a ’moving
target’ as the population of cells constantly shifts during
therapy [22]. A better understanding of the evolutionary
process that underlies drug resistance is needed for
avoiding or postponing the emergence of resistance. This
can be done e.g., via planning dosing schedules [23],
using a combination of drugs [24] or through the design of
medicines that would be more resilient to drug resistance
[25].

that binds to the drug. In both cases, the effects of the
mutations are not local to the drug, but can also alter the
dynamics and hence efficiency of the whole protein. For
this reason, only a relatively small subset of residues can
in fact be mutated [25], even when dozens of resistance
mutations can exist for the same protein [11].

Definition of the fitness of tumors
The evolutionary concept of fitness refers to the
ability of an organism to survive and reproduce (i.e.,
contribute genes to the next generation) [26]. This
definition should be adjusted to be suitable to discuss
tumors. Therefore, instead of discussing fitness over
generations (Darwinian fitness), we refer to the Malthusian
fitness, which is a measure of fitness over a small period
of time [27]:

Here, Nt and N0 represent the number of individuals
(cells) in the population initially and at time t . We can thus
estimate the difference in the fitness of two populations
(here: tumor clones) by their growth at a particular time
frame. Tumor clones with large positive m will grow
faster than others, whereas tumor clones with negative
Malthusian fitness will shrink. Note that m is not a static
constant. Rather, the Malthusian fitness, and the rate of
tumor proliferation, depend on the genetic population and
on the type of treatment (if any). Targeted therapy initially
results in negative values of m, which makes the tumor
shrink (at least somewhat). Drug resistance will set the
value of the Malthusian fitness back to positive.

CANCER DRUG RESISTANCE AND
POPULATION GENETICS
Resistance mutations
The evolutionary dynamics of drug resistance can
be reasoned by applying population genetics models. The
drug target is often a protein or an enzyme that have been
evolved to carry out its biological function(s). A kinase,
for example, binds and phosphorylates specific proteins.
There is often an intricate control, i.e., the drug target
is activated by certain interactions, whereas it activates
others. Driver mutations can make a protein constitutively
active, by relieving it from the ability to be controlled.
Once targeted by a drug though, the protein is incapable
to carry out a function that is essential for the tumor. A
resistance mutation recovers the function of the drug target
even in the presence of the drug.
It is possible to divide resistance mutations into
two groups. The first are mutations that interfere with the
binding of the drug. The second are mutations that make
the drug target perform their biological function more
efficiently, so that those proteins that escape the drug make
the tumor resistant. Given that the drug target has been
evolved for so long to carry out its function in a way that
is most beneficial for the organism, mutations of the first
type are likely to be more common.
Mutations that interfere with drug binding do so by
altering the active domain of the protein (e.g., the catalytic
domain of an enzyme, Figure 2) directly or indirectly.
Direct interference happens by altering residues at the
binding site. Indirect interactions modify the dynamics
of the protein, e.g., by destabilizing an inactive state

acquire mutations and become distinct. Each distinct cancer stem
cell (cells marked with an asterix) replicates and generate cells
that differentiate, leading to the formation of clones, illustrated
here by different colors. The clones may have different properties
with respect to their ability to survive under different sorts of
pressure: treatment, hypoxia, nutrient shortage etc.

Pre-existing or acquired resistance

Ns where N is the effective population size (number of
cells capable of reproduction) and s is the selection
coefficient, which is zero for neutral mutations, negative
for mutations that lower the fitness and positive for those
that increase the fitness. Quite often, slightly deleterious
mutations (Ns close to zero but negative) get fixed in the
population. The smaller is the effective population size,
the more likely it is for deleterious mutations to get fixed.
Thus, mutations that lead to resistance can be present
in the tumor prior to treatment, even if they reduce the
fitness of the tumor, as long as they emerge early enough.
Once the treatment begins, the selection coefficient of the
mutants increase at once because the cells that carry the
mutation are drug resistant, whereas other cells are not.
In contrast to pre-existing resistance, acquired
resistance means that, upon treatment, a mutation

Due to many different factors, the mutation rate in
cancer cells is higher than in normal (non-tumor) cells.
Furthermore, it can vary by as much as three orders of
magnitudes between cancers and even patients [28]. In
chronic cancers, the tumor may grow for years before
it is treated, giving ample time for resistance mutations
to emerge and get fixed within the population of tumor
cells prior to the beginning of treatment. If the resistance
mutation is neutral in all other aspects, i.e., it does not
affect the fitness of the tumor prior to treatment, its
probability of fixation is proportional to its proportion in
the population, i.e., the earlier it emerges within the tumor
the higher the chance that it would get fixed. In general, the
probability of fixation of a mutant depends on the product

Figure 2: Conservation at the drug targets. The drug targets (here: the kinase domain of anaplastic lymphoma kinase, ALK) are

usually proteins whose function is crucial to the tumor cells. Such proteins include many residues where modifications are limited or unlikely
to be tolerated (conserved residues, see the color code). Even at less conserved residues, random mutations can lead to destabilization of the
structure or interfere with the biological activity. Under strong selective pressure on the tumor due to drugs (here: crizotinib, represented
with balls-and-sticks), some mutations can become beneficial and lead to improved fitness. Evolutionary conservation was calculated with
Consurf [83] . Molecular graphics and analyses were performed with the UCSF Chimera package [84]. UCSF Chimera is developed by

emerges that carries a selection benefit (positive selection
coefficient) to the treated population of tumor cells. Such
mutations are likely to be fixed in the population of the
tumor cells. The longer the treatment, the higher the
chance that a resistance mutation will emerge in this way.
A more aggressive treatment (e.g., a higher dose of the
drug) has two contradicting effects on the development
of acquired resistance. On the one hand, it reduces the
Malthusian fitness of sensitive clones and thus selects for
resistance clones. On the other hand, it reduces the overall
size of the tumor and thereby presumably also the effective
population size, thus leading to a smaller population of
cells that can mutate and acquire de novo resistance.
The discussion about pre-existing versus acquired
resistance is not only of a theoretical nature. If a resistance
mutation is pre-existing, tumor clones that carry this
mutation will quickly be selected. The more aggressive
the treatment, the more likely it is that such mutations will
dominate the tumor cell population because their selection
coefficient is higher. If, on the other hand, mutations
are acquired upon treatment, the more aggressive the
treatment the faster the tumor recedes and the less likely
it is for such mutations to emerge. Note, however, that if
a resistance mutation does emerge in a smaller population
its probability to be fixed is higher.
Experimental evidence reveals that both acquired
(de novo) and pre-existing drug resistance mechanisms
exist. For example, pre-existing mutations in MEK1 drive
resistance to BRAF inhibitors in melanoma patients [29],
whereas acquired mutations in KRAS mediate resistance
to Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets EGFR
[30]. Mathematical analysis of the evolution of resistance
mutations to imatinib suggested that at most a single
clone of resistant mutant cells exists prior to treatment
[31]. Earlier reports have indeed reported on resistance
single nucleotide variation (SNV) mutations that pre-exist
treatment with imatinib [32, 33, 34, 35]. Such mutations
can be favorable, neutral, or slightly deleterious in the
context of tumor growth. Following on the exponential
growth doubling time of transfected murine bone marrow
cells revealed that three Abl1 resistance mutations (T315I,
E255K and Y253F) grew faster than wild type cells under
the experimental conditions [36]. Kinase efficiency was
higher than wild-type for two Abl1 mutants (E255K and
Y253F) but not for the multi-drug resistance T315I or
any of the other tested mutations [36]. Clinical data from
imatinib-treated CML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) patients revealed preference for the mutants that
confer higher kinase activity (E255K and Y253F) [37].
Analysis of the multiple sequence analysis of Abl1 and
its homologues reveals that lysine is more common
than glutamate and phenylalanine is more common than
tyrosine in the positions corresponding to Abl1 E255
and Y253, respectively, which also indicates that these
mutations at these positions are favored [25]. Finally, there
is evidence of resistance mutations that disappeared upon
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

discontinuation [38] or modification of treatment [39,
40], which indicates that they are somewhat deleterious
when they do not confer resistance. The sensitive ultradeep sequencing methods used in the reported studies
[40] revealed that old mutations were wiped out by de
novo resistance mutations. Altogether, it appears that
both acquired and preexisting mutations exist, and that
many resistance mutations are deleterious to the tumor,
and are not tolerated in the absence of therapy. The latter
conclusion may indicate that alternating between therapies
can be beneficial.

Drug resistance is a consequence of endogenous
defense mechanisms
Drug resistance can be seen as a necessary
evolutionary consequence to the body’s need to get rid
of toxins [41] or xenobiotics. Protection mechanisms
involve proteins that pump the drugs out of the cells (e.g.,
P-glycoprotein), mutation of the target of a particular
toxin, and activation of alternate biological pathways
instead of the one hit by a toxin. These are also welldescribed resistance mechanisms. The mutator phenotype
of many cancers, by which they have a much higher
rate of mutations compared to benign cells, may also
be an endogenous response, since a high mutation rate
may accelerate the ability of cells to adapt to a harmful
substance [42]. For this reason, it is challenging to deal
with drug resistance. In fact, drug resistance is observed in
the clinic not only in cancer and pathogen-driven diseases,
but also in other cases. One such example is resistance
to platelet inhibitors [43], where over-expression of the
drug target is one of the mechanisms that lead to failure
of treatment.

THE CANCER STEM CELL HYPOTHESIS
The cancer cell population is very heterogeneous.
Cells within a tumor are not equivalent, neither
structurally nor genetically [44]. Somatic mutations arise
before and during the development of the tumor and lead
to evolution of clones of tumor cells, with a different
genetic background. The heterogeneity of cancers presents
an obstacle to targeted treatment [45] even if the tumor
becomes more heterogeneous at times due to selection of
the fitter clones (homogenization) [46].
According to the cancer stem cell hypothesis, the
bulk tumor cells lack the capacity to self-renew. Only a
minority of the cancer cells, namely cancer-stem cells
(CSCs), is capable of self reproduction. The stem cells
are thus the source of heterogeneity in the tumor. CSCs
are rather insensitive to chemotherapy and radiation,
can reside in a dormant state for a long duration and can
spread to parts of the body other than where they originate
from [47]. They thus support three hallmarks of cancer
11749

CANCER STEM CELLS AND DRUG
RESISTANCE

[48]: evading apoptosis, limitless replicative potential
and tissue invasion as well as metastasis. The CSCs drive
tumorigenesis and drug resistance.
It is not clear how many types of cancer follow the
CSC concept, but it is clear that these include leukemias
(most notably chronic myeloid leukemia) as well as
various solid tumors. The frequency of CSCs among
tumor cells varies between different cancers and probably
also within tumors. Studies report on frequencies of 10−6
in acute myeloid leukemia [49], and 10−4 of in solid tumors
[50]. In estimating the frequencies of CSCs, it is assumed
that they express specific markers (e.g., CD38− CD44+
[51]). Of note, the real proportion of cells displaying
a CSC phenotype is likely to be higher than reported
(though still rather small). This is because there may be
multiple types of CSCs within a tumor, each conveying a
different set of markers, whereas assays typically search
for a specific combination of stem-cell markers. It had
previously been noted that “the question of whether the
entire neoplasm or a minority of neoplastic cells is capable
of self-renewal is, at least in part, a question merely of
the effective population size of the evolving cells in a
neoplasm” [52]. The effective population of cells capable
of self renewal appears to be very large in advanced
cancers, whereas it is much smaller in the initial stages of
cancers that follow the CSC concept [53].
The CSC hypothesis provides explanation to
intriguing phenomena that are observed in many types
of cancer. The first of this is recurrence. Patients after
treatment may appear and feel healthy again. They show
no sign of any neoplasm in medical examinations, yet the
disease emerges again after months or even years. This has
been explained through the presence of dormant CSC that
become active again. Metastases that appear years after a
successful surgery are also attributed to dormant CSC. In
addition, the CSC hypothesis explains why some cancer
cells are able to form tumors when transplanted, whereas
others can not [54] - CSCs are tumorigenic whereas
differentiated cells are not.
In spite of increasing experimental evidence,
the CSC hypothesis remains controversial. From an
evolutionary point of view, it is certainly challenging to
explain. Why are cancer stem cells rare, given that if all
cells had the CSC phenotype cancers would apparently
develop faster [55, 56]? One explanation could be that
there is actually an evolutionary advantage in dividing the
tumor into stem-cells and differentiated cells, as the latter
type could carry out more specialized assignments within
the tumor such as scavenging nutrients or communicating
with the stroma. Furthermore, maintaining a relatively
small population of cells that are capable of self-renewal
(smaller effective population size) can lead to faster
adoption of new traits [57], such as drug resistance.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

If all cells within a tumor are able to divide and
inherit genetic changes to the next generation, there
is a strong selection pressure for the cells to develop
resistance - those that are not fit will not survive. A crucial
difference in cancers that follow the CSC hypothesis is
that conventional therapies have a much smaller capacity
to kill the CSCs [58, 59, 60, 61]. If resistance mutations
preexist treatment, it is clear that only descendants of
resistant CSCs will survive and out-compete all other cells.
For resistance mutations to occur de novo, new mutations
have to arise. Indeed, data from leukemia patients suggests
that tumor heterogeneity increases significantly following
treatment, i.e., quite often not one but several different
resistance mutations occur [40]. These mutations are not
observed prior to treatment even with state-of-the-art
sequencing techniques that are very sensitive. The onset
of multiple mutations could be explained by an increase
of the mutation rate of the CSCs, by an increase in the
number of cell divisions, or by a combination of the two.
The biological mechanism of compensatory proliferation
is in line with the second mechanism and could explain
how resistance emerge within cancers that follow the CSC
hypothesis.

THERAPEUTIC
RESPONSE
PATIENT SURVIVAL

AND

An important limitation of the discussion on the
fitness of tumors is that the subject of treatment is not the
tumor but the patient. Therapeutic response (diminishment
of the tumor or progression free survival) does not
necessarily translate to overall survival [62]. The CSC
theory alone cannot explain this paradox. At the very
least, therapy should prolong the life of the patient by as
long as the progression free survival phase, but the benefit
(in terms of life expectancy) of therapy is often smaller
[63]. It is not that targeted therapy is ineffective. It is
often capable of shrinking the tumor and in many cases
increases overall survival. Imatinib and other Bcr-Abl
agents, for example, can increase the life-expectancy of
patients by many years. Some newly approved KIs such
as afatinib also carry out significant benefits in terms of
overall survival (12 month benefit relative to cisplatin
according to the manufacturer), whereas the situation is
less clear with others. On December 2015, The European
Medicines Agency recommended the EGFR inhibitor
osimertinib for conditional approval, while noting that
“The benefits in terms of progression free survival and/
or overall survival have not yet been determined”. Other
agents failed in clinical trials due to inability to improve
the overall survival. Some recent examples include
the mTor inhibitor everolimus, which did not improve
11750

overall survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients after
failure of sorafenib [64]; and bevacizumab, which did
not improve the overall survival in first-line treatment for
glioblastoma [65].
Natural selection within the tumor can be used to
explain the inability of some drugs to increase the overall
survival despite (temporarily) limiting tumor growth.
The drugs select for the most resilient cells, which
often leads to a more rapidly increasing and metastatic
tumor (oncogenic resistance [16, 63, 66]). Moreover,
diminishment of the effective population size increases
the probability of fixation of novel mutations (vide supra,
“Pre-existing or acquired resistance”), which may increase
the fitness of the tumor relative to the pre-treatment state.
Another contributing factor is that side effects of the
treatment often weaken the patient and limit the ability
of body to survive the disease. Furthermore, depending
on the activity of multiple signaling networks, a given
therapy may be totally inadequate in a particular stage [9,
10]. Finally, compensatory proliferation may also partially
explain why overall survival is shorter than expected.

of having been exposed to radiation [68]. A compensatory
mechanism, where the surviving cells were stimulated to
proliferation was proposed to explain the findings.
Targeted treatment kills the bulk of tumor cells,
but is much less effective against CSCs (Figure 3).
Compensatory mechanism provokes self-renewal of
CSCs (Figure 4). The rate of self-renewal (birth rate) is
lower than the death rate of sensitive cells, and hence the
tumor shrinks. Since mutations are generated through
meiosis, gene replication, recombination and chromosome
segregation, an increased rate of CSC replication leads
to an increased rate of mutations. The vast majority of
the mutations that survive will be nearly neutral, but
occasionally a resistance mutation will emerge. Thus,
compensatory proliferation explains the development of
resistance within cancers that follow the CSC hypothesis,
even if “stem cells are resistant to resistance” [63] (as they
are not sensitive to targeted therapy).
Do we need to account for compensatory
proliferation to explain the evolution of drug resistance?
Mathematical reasoning led to the conclusion that
resistance mutations predate treatment but become fixed
in the population following targeted therapy [69]. While
this corroboration explains many earlier findings, it is at
odds with recent evidence that showed a large proportion
of various mutations in drug targets following treatment.
Another puzzling finding that can be explained through
compensatory mechanism is a sudden increase in the
number of mutations in the drug target Abl1 following
change of drugs [40]. The Abl1 kinase is the primary
target for treating Ph+ leukemias. Different Abl1 inhibitors
are used in the clinic, with various resistance profiles.
When resistance to a given Abl1 inhibitor is observed, a
patient is often advised to switch to a different drug. Such

COMPENSATORY PROLIFERATION
To rationalize the evolution of multiple de
novo resistance mutations, we invoke the concept of
compensatory proliferation. Compensatory proliferation is
discussed mainly in the context of developmental biology.
Simply put, this concept states that dying cells (usually
through apoptosis), convey signals to the nearby cells
thereby stimulating mitosis [67]. This results in (partial)
compensation for the death of cells. Such compensatory
mechanisms were discussed for the first time in a study of
fruit flies that survived and had normal appearance in spite

The CSCs increase their replication rate, which leads to new
mutations. Some of these mutations can be beneficial to the
tumor’s fitness and can thus become prevalent in the population.

CONCLUSIONS

changes can result in temporary relief, but relapse often
follows from development of new resistance mutations.
Interestingly, it has been found that many of the patients
initially develop several different mutations, each covering
a sub-clone of the tumor [39, 40]. Genetic modifications
are observed in as little as few weeks after treatment, but
the mutations are not observed until the new treatment
initiates, even when using the most sensitive techniques
[39]. Thus, it is unlikely that resistance mutations emerged
prior to treatment, and more likely that mutations emerge
as a result of the targeted therapy (de novo mutations).
This observation can be explained by a compensatory
mechanism that leads to an increase in number of cell
divisions and hence mutations.

Understanding how resistance to targeted therapy
occurs is necessary to prolong the effect of modern
anti-cancer drugs. This is not as straightforward as in
communicable diseases, where it is clear that the drug
kills the pathogen and therefore the pathogen must
develop resistance to survive. In cancers, the principle of
compensatory proliferation is used to explain how resistance to therapy occurs, in particular in neoplasms that
follow the cancer stem cell hypothesis. This calls for a
better characterization of compensatory mechanisms in
mammals. Two pathways seem to be involved in AICP
according to the current knowledge: JNK and iPLA2.
Thus, it may be possible to use combination therapy that
blocks the traditional drug target (such as a kinase or a
hormone receptor) and mitogens that are responsible for
proliferation through signaling. The discovery of selective
inhibitors of JNK enzymes [79] shall enable the testing of
dual-inhibition scheme and can reveal its pros and cons. In
some cancers, PGE2 is involved in tumor cell repopulation
[78]. Given that commonly used non-steroidal anti
inflammatory drugs inhibit the synthesis of PGE2, it
may soon be possible to test whether a combination of
such drugs and targeted therapy or chemotherapy can
circumvent drug resistance.
Theory [80] and simulations [81] predicted that
drugs targeting cooperation among individuals in
bacterial colonies will be less prone for development
of resistance. This has recently been demonstrated in
an experiment, where bacteria were subject either to
gallium or to antibiotics [82]. The gallium ions targeted
sidosphores, metal-chelating molecules that are secreted
by bacteria to scavenge iron ions. Since sidosphores are
secreted, they improve the survival of the colony but do
not necessarily increase the fitness of the bacterial cells
that secret them. Indeed, resistance was observed against
antibiotic treatment but not against treatment with gallium
ions. Likewise, compensatory proliferation mechanisms
may be useful as a drug target in cancers, and resistance to
their inhibitors is likely to be more limited than to targeted
therapies.

Biological mechanism
The most well described compensatory mechanism
is apoptosis-induced compensatory proliferation (AICP).
Cytotoxic cancer treatments (chemotherapy and radiation)
are known to induce apoptosis. How targeted therapy kills
tumor cells is less clear. There is some evidence, however, that drugs such as imatinib lead to elevated levels
of activated caspases [70], which are apoptosis-related
enzymes. Likewise, challenging NSCLC lines with the
kinase inhibitor erlotinib activates caspases [71]. Targeting
apoptotic pathways is an active line of development of
cancer therapies [72, 73].
Caspases are central to the process of apoptosis
and to AICP. Their interactions with down-stream
effectors lead to cell death and to expression of
mitogens. The mitogens in their turn diffuse to nearby
cells or compartments and induce mitosis of CSCs.
Two mechanisms of AICP are known in Drosophila
Melanogaster. One of these involves the JNK signaling
pathway [74]. Interestingly, studies reveal JNK proteins
to have a dual role: they can be either proto-oncogenes
or tumor suppressors [75]. The first role may be due to
stimulation of proliferation of CSCs, whereas tumor
suppression may stem from JNK involvement in apoptosis.
Other than JNK, calcium-independent phospholipase A2
(iPLA2) seems to be important for AICP in mice [76].
Interestingly, in spite of its role in mediating apoptosis,
iPLA2 was also indicated as a drug target for ovarian
cancer, due to its role in promotion of proliferation [77].
Recently, a different compensatory mechanism has
been proposed based on experiments in bladder tumors
[78]. In these tumors, dying cells release a signaling lipid
molecule called prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 leads to
proliferation of cells, similarly to repopulation of a tissue
after injury. It has been shown that drugs that block the
synthesis of PGE2 inhibit the repopulation of the tumor.
This suggests that such treatments can also limit the
development of resistance mutations.
