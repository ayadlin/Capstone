Abstract

Author Manuscript

Failure of T cells to protect against cancer is thought to result from lack of antigen recognition,
chronic activation, and/or suppression by other cells. Using a mouse sarcoma model, we show that
glucose consumption by tumors metabolically restricts T cells, leading to their dampened mTOR
activity, glycolytic capacity, and IFN-γ production, thereby allowing tumor progression. We show
that enhancing glycolysis in an antigenic ‘regressor’ tumor is sufficient to override the protective
ability of T cells to control tumor growth. We also show that checkpoint blockade antibodies
against CTLA-4, PD-1, and PD-L1, which are used clinically, restore glucose in tumors,
permitting T cell glycolysis and IFN-γ production. Furthermore, we found that blocking PD-L1
directly on tumors dampens glycolysis by inhibiting mTOR activity and decreasing expression of
glycolysis enzymes, reflecting a role for PD-L1 in tumor glucose utilization. Our results establish
that tumor-imposed metabolic restrictions can mediate T cell hyporesponsiveness during cancer.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Establishing why some cancers progress while others do not is a longstanding challenge in
immunology. Destruction of strongly immunogenic tumors is a critical part of the antitumor
immune response. However, cancers that express weakly immunogenic antigens evade
killing and this can be a primary mechanism of tumor progression (Vesely and Schreiber,
2013). Tumors are also known to escape immunity via T cell dysfunction, or
hyporesponsiveness. Anergy, exhaustion, and senescence, have all been described in T cells
from cancer patients (Crespo et al., 2013; Wherry, 2011) – and chronic TCR stimulation,
lack of costimulation, and active suppression by other cells are implicated in T cell
dysfunction. However, whether other mechanisms exist, or precisely how T cell
hyporesponsiveness in tumors is established, remains unclear.

Nutrient competition between cells can influence cell growth, survival, and function. A
fierce competition likely exists between cells in the tumor microenvironment, as demand for
resources in this niche is high. Metabolic interplay between tumors and immune cells has
been demonstrated. Tumor cells can express indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, an enzyme that
depletes tryptophan and inhibits T cell proliferation (Munn and Mellor, 2013; Munn et al.,
1999). Tumor-derived lactate can also suppress T cell function by blocking lactate export
(Fischer et al., 2007), which disrupts their ability to maintain aerobic glycolysis. Aerobic
glycolysis is required for optimal T cell effector function (Cham et al., 2008, but not for
activation, proliferation, or survival (Chang et al., 2013). We previously found that in vitro,
tumor cells outcompete T cells for glucose, and this lack of glucose directly impedes
cytokine production that can be critical for tumor clearance. Since many tumors have high
rates of glycolysis (Gatenby and Gillies, 2004; Warburg, 1956), we hypothesized that tumorinfiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes (TILs) could experience a loss of function, due to altered
metabolism resulting from tumor-imposed glucose restriction.

We sought to establish whether glucose competition in the tumor microenvironment, in its
own right, could determine cancer progression by regulating the ‘nutrient-fed’ state of TILs,
and thus their functionality.

We used an established mouse model of regressing and progressing tumors (Gubin et al.,
2014; Matsushita et al., 2012). D42m1-T2 (R tumor) is a regressor clone of the d42m1
sarcoma that expresses the major rejection antigen mutant spectrin-β2. After transplantation
into mice, tumor rejection occurs at ~day 12 in a manner that depends on IFN-γ production
from TILs (Matsushita et al., 2012). D42m1-T3 (P tumor) is a progressor clone of d42m1
that lacks this rejection antigen and grows progressively after transplantation (Figure 1A).
We cultured R or P tumors with activated C3 T cells, which recognize mutant spectrin-β2
(Matsushita et al., 2012) and measured IFN-γ production. We predicted that regardless of
glucose competition, C3 T cells cultured with R tumor cells might produce more IFN-γ,
since they would be stimulated by antigen on the R tumor cells, while C3 T cells cultured
alone, or with P tumor cells, would make less as they would receive no additional
stimulation. However, C3 T cells cultured alone produced more IFN-γ than when cultured
with R tumor cells, and C3 T cells cultured with P tumor cells made the least (Figure 1B).
Similar results in IFN-γ production were observed when tumors were cultured with
polyclonal T cells (data not shown). Furthermore, IFN-γ production correlated to the
amount of glucose that remained in the media after co-culture (Figure 1C). We added
glucose to the co-cultures and IFN-γ production significantly increased (Figure 1B),
indicating that glucose utilization, and thus competition for this sugar, was directly
regulating T cell effector function. We confirmed that the extracellular acidification rate
(ECAR) (Nicholls et al., 2010), an indicator of aerobic glycolysis, the process where glucose
is converted to lactate in the presence of oxygen, was higher in the P than the R tumor
(Figure 1D, left), supporting that the P tumor consumes more glucose (Figure 1C). Although
the ECAR of these tumors differed, their rates of proliferation in vitro were similar (Figure
1D, right), demonstrating that glycolysis is not directly coupled to proliferation in these
cells. To further explore glucose competition, we impaired R tumor glycolysis with an
inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Kim et al., 2002; Laplante and
Sabatini, 2012), or promoted glycolysis with the Akt activator 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT)
(Doughty et al., 2006; Kohn et al., 1998) (Figure S1A). We cultured tumor cells with
activated OT-I T cells, which recognize Ova peptide and cannot mediate an antigen-specific
response against this tumor, allowing us to assess cytokine responses independently of
antigen-specific stimulation. Upon PMA/ionomycin stimulation, T cells cultured with
rapamycin pretreated R tumor cells produced more IFN-γ than those with untreated tumor
cells (Figure S1B), while T cells cultured with 4-HT pretreated R tumor cells produced less
IFN-γ (Figure S1C). Adding glucose enhanced IFN-γ production in a dose dependent
manner (Figure S1C), indicating that tumor and T cells competed for glucose.
Although R and P tumors differ in antigenicity, tumor-specific T cells infiltrate both tumors
(Gubin et al., 2014; Matsushita et al., 2012). TILs in the R and P tumors were activated and

expressed T-bet (Figure 1E, F, top), suggesting that TILs from either tumor were
transcriptionally competent to produce IFN-γ (Anichini et al., 2010; Parish and Kaech,
2009). However, as has been shown (Gubin et al., 2014), TILs in the P tumors were PD-1hi,
consistent with hyporesponsiveness (Ahmadzadeh et al., 2009; Baitsch et al., 2011). Grossly,
the immune cell infiltrates were similar in R and P tumors, although the relative frequency of
T regulatory (Treg) cells and the balance of M1 versus M2 macrophages differed (Figure
S1D–F). These results suggested that while activated TILs infiltrate both tumors, TILs in the
P tumor might be hyporesponsive.

Author Manuscript

We wondered whether higher glycolysis in P tumors limited glucose in the
microenvironment and contributed to TIL hyporesponsiveness. mTOR is an environmental
sensor, and mTOR pathway signals decrease when nutrients are restricted (Gatenby and
Gillies, 2004; Kim et al., 2002). We reasoned that mTOR activity would directly reflect TIL
nutrient status. P-TILs had decreased 4E-BP1 and S6 kinase phosphorylation compared to
R-TILs (Figure 1F, bottom). These data support the view that P tumors, which consume
more glucose (Figure 1C) and display higher ECAR (Figure 1D, left), and thus have a higher
glycolytic rate, impose a more severe glucose restriction on TILs than R tumors.

Author Manuscript

While many signals exist in tumors that dampen T cells (Francisco et al., 2010; Keir et al.,
2008; Simpson et al., 2013), we focused on whether metabolic competition in tumors is a
fundamental force that drives immune cell dysfunction. ECAR of P-TILs was lower than RTILs (Figure 1G, left), indicating less aerobic glycolysis. Unlike R-TILs, P-TILs did not
robustly augment glycolysis when respiration was blocked (Figure 1H). Ex vivo P tumor
cells also exhibited higher ECAR than R tumor cells (Figure 1G, right), which was inversely
proportional to the metabolism of TILs isolated from that tumor (Figure 1G, left), suggesting
a metabolic interplay between tumors and TILs. After restimulation, PTILs produced less
IFN-γ than R-TILs (Figure 1I) and glucose concentration in the P tumor milieu was lower
(Figure 1J). These data link elevated ECAR of P tumors with lower available glucose in the
tumor microenvironment. To directly address whether PTILs are glucose-restricted, we
injected the fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG and tracked its uptake by TILs. P-TILs
acquired less 2-NBDG than R-TILs (Figure 1K), which is consistent with their reduced
ECAR (Figure 1G, left). Taken together, these results suggest that TILs are glucoserestricted in the P tumor, and that this accounts for their impaired glycolytic capacity and
effector function.
Tumor-imposed nutrient restrictions can lead to T cell hyporesponsiveness, even when
tumors are highly antigenic

Author Manuscript

Antigen-specific T cell responses are critical for tumor clearance (Baitsch et al., 2011;
Matsushita et al., 2012) and mutant spectrin-β2 expressed by R (but not P) tumors is an
important target for tumor rejection (Matsushita et al., 2012). Given that the antigenicity of
R and P tumors differs, we designed experiments to address how nutrient competition alone
could affect TIL activity. We began by using EL4 tumors that express Ova (EL4-Ova) and
OT-I T cells, allowing us to investigate the impact of nutrient limitation in T cells with
defined antigen specificity. We enhanced nutrient restriction by increasing tumor cell
number. We injected either 1×106 or 40×106 EL4-Ova cells intraperitoneally (i.p.) and then

intravenously (i.v.) transferred 2×104 naïve OT-I T cells into mice (Figure 2A). OT-I T cells
infiltrated the peritoneal cavities of mice with high or low tumor burdens, however they
displayed lower mTOR activity in mice injected with 40×106 tumor cells (Figure 2B).
Moreover, these cells produced less IFN-γ after restimulation, which was also apparent in
endogenous T cells that had entered the peritoneal cavity as part of the antitumor response
(Figure 2C). In attempt to transiently enhance glucose levels in mice that received OT-I T
cells and 40×106 EL4-Ova cells, we injected a bolus of glucose or PBS 2.5 and 5 hours prior
to assessing OT-I T cell IFN-γ production. We concurrently injected BFA into these mice to
capture in situ IFN-γ production. The T cells in the glucose-injected mice produced more
IFN-γ (Figure 2D). These data show that antigen-specific T cell effector function can be
affected by tumor cell numbers and glucose concentrations in vivo, suggesting that tumorimposed nutrient-restriction of T cells can contribute to hyporesponsiveness.

Nutrient competition between tumors and T cells can regulate cancer progression

The experiments in Figure 2 show that T cell hyporesponsiveness developed despite the
presence of more antigen, differing from published data showing that increases in cell-free
antigen concentrations promote T cell IFN-γ production (Constant et al., 1995). We reasoned
that when antigen is sufficient, tumors might inhibit immunity through nutrient
consumption, leaving TILs at a metabolic disadvantage. We aimed to alter tumor
metabolism directly so that we could compare between groups using the same tumor with
equal cell numbers, removing the confounding factor of differing antigenicity. Tumor cells
cultured for extended periods of time in low glucose adapt by increasing respiration (Birsoy
et al., 2014), indicating that modulating nutrients can alter metabolism. We cultured R tumor
cells in high glucose (50 mM) and low serum (1% FCS) over several weeks to select R
tumor cells with increased glycolysis (R-1%), while also culturing the original R tumor in
control media (11 mM glucose, 10% FCS). When returned to control media, the R-1%
tumor cells displayed enhanced ECAR and glucose uptake compared to the original R tumor
cells, although not to the extent observed in P tumor cells (Figure 3A). We transplanted
R-1% tumors into mice and 10 of 14 recipients developed either fully progressing tumors, or
exhibited delayed regression (Figures 3B, S2A). At day 20, all 13 of the original R tumors
had regressed, while only 4 of 14 R-1% tumors had fully regressed (Figures 3B, S2A). The
progressing R-1% tumors still expressed mutant spectrin-β2 (Figures 3C, S2B), indicating
that gain of a ‘progressor’ phenotype in R-1% tumors was not due to the loss of a dominant
epitope recognized by TILs. Furthermore, R and R-1% tumor cells grow at the same rate
both in vitro (Figure S2C), and in RAG−/− mice, which lack B and T cells (Figure 3D).
These data demonstrate that progression of R-1% tumors was not due to enhanced
proliferation or a tumor-intrinsic survival advantage, but rather due to tumor imposed
impairment of the adaptive immune response.
While there could be differences in the R-1% tumors beyond glycolysis, we reasoned that
they progressed due to their enhanced glucose uptake (Figure 3A, right). Therefore, we
predicted that manipulating the glycolysis pathway directly should also turn the R tumor into
a progressor tumor. Using a genetic gain-of-function approach, we transduced R tumors with
retrovirus expressing c-Myc, a transcription factor that drives glycolysis (Gordan et al.,
2007). c-Myc expressing R tumors (R-cMyc) displayed enhanced ECAR in vitro (Figure

3E), compared to R tumors expressing the empty vector (R-EV Ctrl). We also observed that
the R-EV Ctrl tumors displayed higher ECAR than non-transduced R tumor cells. These
data suggested that while the enhanced glycolysis of R-cMyc tumors should confer a
progressor phenotype compared to non-transduced R tumors and R-EV Ctrl tumors, the REV Ctrl tumors could also conceivably exhibit some progression compared to nontransduced R tumors, due to their enhanced glycolysis. We transplanted R-cMyc tumors into
mice and 22 of 30 mice (73%) had tumors ≥5 mm at day 21, while only 5 of 41 mice (12%)
with R-EV Ctrl tumors had tumors larger than this size (Figures 3F, S2D). We speculated
that the elevated ECAR in R-EV Ctrl tumors compared to non-transduced R tumors caused
progression or delayed regression in a few mice when compared to non-transduced R
tumors, which normally fully regress by day 21 (Figures 1A, 3B). Therefore, we compared
between groups based on tumor size at day 21. Importantly, c-Myc expressing R tumors
maintained expression of mutant spectrin-β2 (Figures 3G, S2B). These data show that in
spite of remaining antigenic, c-Myc expressing tumors became more glycolytic and gained a
‘progressor’ phenotype.

Since c-Myc may drive programs beyond glycolysis, we more directly tested the role of
glucose competition in antigenic tumor progression. We transduced R tumors with retrovirus
expressing pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), an enzyme that sits at a key
bifurcation point between glycolysis and OXPHOS (Gerriets et al., 2015). We also
transduced R tumor cells with the glucose transporter Glut1, and hexokinase II (HK2), the
first enzyme in the glycolysis pathway. PDK1-, Glut1-, and HK2-expressing R tumors (RPDK1, R-Glut1, and R-HK2) displayed higher ECAR compared to R-EV Ctrl cells,
consistent with enhanced glycolysis (Figure 3E). When transplanted into mice 16 of 25 RPDK1 tumors (64%), 6 of 15 R-Glut1 tumors (40%), and 10 of 15 R-HK2 tumors (67%) had
tumors ≥5 mm at day 21, compared to only 5 of 41 R-EV Ctrl tumors (12%) (Figures 3F,
S2D). All tumors expressed mutant spectrin-β2 (Figures 3G, S2B). In addition, activated C3
T cells efficiently killed the R-1% and the transduced R tumors when in nutrient rich
conditions in vitro, further confirming that these tumors remained fully antigenic (Figures
S2E, F). Moreover, the transduced tumors cultured in vitro (Figure S2G), or in RAG−/−
mice, grew at fairly similar rates (Figure S2H), indicating that the difference in progression
between the tumors expressing glycolysis genes versus the EV Ctrl was not only due to
differences in growth rates. We injected 2-NBDG into mice bearing transduced tumors. TILs
in tumors expressing glycolysis genes acquired less glucose than TILs in tumors expressing
the EV-Ctrl (Figure 3H). In co-culture, glycolysis gene transduced tumor cells dampened
OT-I cell IFN-γ production more than the EV Ctrl transduced tumors, and the addition of
glucose substantially increased IFN-γ production (Figure S2I). Together these results
suggest that tumor cell metabolism can determine cancer progression by impairing antigenspecific immune responses.
Checkpoint blockade therapy corrects nutrient restriction experienced by T cells in a
progressing tumor
Checkpoint blockade therapy activates antitumor immunity by targeting proteins that inhibit
T cells (Brahmer et al., 2012; Hamid et al., 2013; Hodi et al., 2010). This treatment can
affect T cell proliferation (Spranger et al., 2014), function (Spranger et al., 2014; West et al.,

Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 September 10.

2013), and glucose uptake (Parry et al., 2005), but the exact mechanisms of how these
various treatments work remain unclear (Page et al., 2014). We reasoned that since these
treatments are effective at inducing the regression of P tumors (Gubin et al., 2014), there
should be an effect on tumor/TIL metabolism after treatment if our proposed model of
metabolic competition in the tumor was correct. We transplanted P tumors into mice and
treated with isotype control or CTLA-4, PD-1, or PD-L1 blockade antibodies at days 3, 6,
and 9 after transplantation and assessed metabolic parameters and TIL function on day 12
(Figure 4A). Treatment with all blockade antibodies resulted in P tumor regression (Figure
4B) (Gubin et al., 2014) and the isotype had no effect on the outcome of P or R tumor
growth (Figure 4B). We excised tumors on day 12 and measured glucose concentrations in
the extracellular milieu. Tumors from blockade antibody-treated mice had more extracellular
glucose (similar to that in R tumors) than isotype treated mice (Figure 4C). In addition, PTILs from blockade antibody treated mice had enhanced ECAR compared to TILs from
isotype treated mice (Figure 4D), correlating glucose availability in the tumor with
glycolysis in TILs. Phosphorylation of their mTOR targets in P-TILs was restored to a level
similar to that in R-TILs (Figure 4E). Finally, the increased glucose in the tumor, and the
greater ECAR observed in TILs, correlated with increased IFN-γ production by the TILs
after therapy (Figure 4F). Our data indicate that blockade therapy corrects the tumor-induced
glucose restriction experienced by TILs and restores their glycolytic capacity and hence their
effector function.

Author Manuscript

Changes in glucose availability might also be reflected in changes in TIL OXPHOS. By
plotting OCR vs. ECAR, we established a baseline for metabolic fitness of TILs from R vs.
P tumors; this measurement emphasized that R-TILs have higher OXPHOS and glycolysis
compared to P-TILs (Figure 4G). CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies increased ECAR and OCR
in P-TILs to levels equal or above those observed in R-TILs, indicating that these treatments
enhanced the overall metabolic fitness of the TILs. PD-L1 antibodies, however, primarily
promoted aerobic glycolysis, rather than OCR, in the TILs (Figure 4G).

Author Manuscript

In addition to augmenting the capacity of TILs to compete for glucose, blockade antibodies
might increase the ability of TILs to compete for other substrates. We assessed the protein
expression of glutamate dehydrogenase (Glud1), which catalyzes the oxidative deamination
of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate, an important process for energy homeostasis in T cells
(Wang et al., 2011). Glud1 expression was increased in P-TILs from mice treated with PDL1 antibodies (Figure S3A). These data suggest that, in addition to glucose, competition for
amino acids, or even other nutrients and growth factors not examined here, may occur within
tumors, and emphasize the fact that checkpoint blockade broadly increases the metabolic
fitness of TILs, which may be central to the beneficial effects of these treatments in cancer
therapy.
We speculated that the enhanced glucose in tumors of treated mice resulted from immunemediated killing, which led to reduced tumor cell numbers and thus a reduction in glucose
consumption. It is known that blocking inhibitory receptors enhances T cell activation
(Francisco et al., 2010; Keir et al., 2008), which might reflect that these treatments allow T
cells to better compete for nutrients like glucose, allowing a greater engagement of
glycolysis by TILs. Consistent with this idea and published reports (Parry et al., 2005;

Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 September 10.

Pedicord et al., 2015; Staron et al., 2014), even treating in vitro activated T cells, which are
already highly glycolytic, with PD-1 and CTLA-4 antibodies further slightly increased
ECAR (Figures S3B, C).
PD-L1 directly regulates tumor metabolism

Author Manuscript

IFN-γ from T cells induces PD-L1 on tumors, and PD-L1 can allow the tumor to evade
immune mediated attack by inhibiting T cell function through PD-1/PD-L1 interaction
(Francisco et al., 2010; Keir et al., 2008). While there is a correlation between PD-L1
expression on melanomas and T cell infiltration (Quezada and Peggs, 2013), this is not the
case for every cancer. Patients with glioblastoma often have high PD-L1 expression, but this
does not correlate with levels of TILs observed in the tumors (Berghoff et al., 2014). Also,
PD-L1 expression on neurons has been shown to, through an unknown, but immuneindependent mechanism, kill glioblastoma cells (Liu et al., 2013), and PD-L1 on cancer cells
mediated killing of T cells in vitro, which occurred independently of PD-1 (Dong et al.,
2002). We considered the possibility that PD-L1 has a function beyond negatively signaling
to T cells via PD-1. We tested whether blocking PD-L1 on tumors directly altered tumor
metabolism. P tumor cell ECAR, as well as glucose uptake, were reduced after in vitro
treatment with PD-L1 antibodies (Figure 5A, B). R tumor cells, which display lower ECAR
than P tumor cells, showed a smaller reduction in ECAR after treatment (Figure 5A).
Antibodies against major histocompatibility complex-I, another surface protein, did not
affect ECAR (Figure S4A). PD-L1 blockade also inhibited ECAR, to varying degrees, in
B16 melanoma, MC38 colon cancer, L cells and progressor clones derived from the d42m1
parent sarcoma (Figure S4B), suggesting a differential sensitivity to this treatment among
tumors.

Author Manuscript

We treated P tumor cells with anti-PD-L1 and observed decreased phosphorylation of
mTOR target proteins (Figures 5C, S4C), which correlated with reduced ECAR. Given that
mTOR directly regulates mRNA translation and ribosome biogenesis (Laplante and Sabatini,
2012), we analyzed protein expression of several glycolysis enzymes after PD-L1 blockade.
We also assessed Akt phosphorylation, since growth factors signal to mTOR via Akt.
Expression of glycolysis enzymes and Akt phosphorylation were decreased after anti-PD-L1
treatment (Figures 5D, S4D). Consistent with the idea that mTOR affects glycolysis by
regulating translation, no differences in transcript levels from key glycolysis genes following
anti-PD-L1 treatment (Figure S4E). These data suggest that PD-L1 regulates the Akt/mTOR
pathway, which results in decreased translation of glycolysis enzymes and thus dampened
glycolysis.

Author Manuscript

We wanted to determine how PD-L1 blockade dampened mTOR signals in our in vitro
system, which is devoid of T cell-expressed PD-1. We reasoned that PD-L1 antibodies might
cause PD-L1 internalization and resultant cessation of downstream events. PD-L1 moved
from the surface to the interior of the cell after treatment with anti-PD-L1 for 30 minutes at
37°C indicating internalization ( Figures 5E, S4F). These results suggest that surface
expressed PD-L1 is important for Akt/mTOR signaling in tumors.
To confirm that PD-L1 regulates glycolysis, we transduced P tumors cells with a retrovirus
expressing a short-hairpin (hp) RNA against PD-L1 (PD-L1 hp) to decrease PD-L1

expression. These tumor cells exhibited reduced ECAR, mTOR pathway and Akt activity,
and glycolysis enzyme expression compared to cells with a control hairpin (Ctrl hp) (Figures
5F–H, S4G). Also, P tumors expressed higher PD-L1 than R tumors (Figure 5I, upper),
which correlated with greater ECAR (Figures 1D, G), glucose uptake (Figures 1B, J), and
glycolysis. Along with decreased ECAR, PD-L1 shRNA decreased PD-L1 expression
(Figure 5I, lower), but did not affect cell proliferation in vitro (Figure S4H), nor did it affect
tumor growth when transplanted into RAG−/− mice (Figure S4I), suggesting that neither PDL1, nor the glycolysis pathway, is necessarily coupled to tumor cell proliferation. To further
verify that PD-L1 expression on tumors modulated glycolysis, we used retroviral
transduction to generate R tumor clones that expressed different PD-L1 levels (high and
low). High PD-L1 expressing R tumors had greater ECAR than low PD-L1 expressing
tumors (Figure 5J). Together our data indicate that PD-L1 expression on tumor cells is
directly associated with their glycolytic rate.

Author Manuscript

Our results suggest that PD-L1 is immunomodulatory, not only because it delivers a negative
signal to T cells via PD-1 (Keir et al., 2008; Spranger et al., 2014), but also because it
enhances tumor cell glycolysis and thus depletes glucose from immune cells in the tumor
microenvironment. To further support the idea that PD-L1 can modulate tumor cell
metabolism, independently of the adaptive immune system, we transplanted PD-L1
expressing tumors into RAG−/− mice and treated with PD-L1 blockade or isotype antibodies.
Glucose levels in the extracellular milieu of excised tumors isolated from mice that received
anti-PD-L1 were higher compared to isotype treated mice (Figure 5K). Importantly, anti-PDL1 treatment of PD-L1-expressing tumors in RAG−/− mice had only a minor effect on
reducing tumor size (data not shown), supporting that in immunocompetent mice, T cell
mediated clearance of tumors is critical (Gubin et al., 2014; Matsushita et al., 2012). Our
results show that expression of PD-L1 on the tumor cell surface maintains Akt/mTOR
signaling, which in turn supports the translation of glycolysis enzymes and promotes this
metabolic pathway. Our data further indicate that PD-L1 blockade therapy dampens
glycolysis in tumors, leaving more available glucose in the extracellular tumor milieu.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Antigen recognition by T cells is critical for tumor clearance, and stronger antigens lead to
stronger activation (Lanzavecchia and Sallusto, 2002; Rao et al., 2010) and a greater
capacity to compete for nutrients. T cells must acquire adequate nutrients to engage the
metabolism that supports their function. We (Chang et al., 2013; O’Sullivan and Pearce,
2015; Pearce et al., 2013), and others (Mellor and Munn, 2008; Mockler et al., 2014;
Srivastava et al., 2010), have speculated that nutrient competition in the tumor
microenvironment in vivo impacts T cell function. We show here that tumors can dampen
TIL function by competing for glucose, despite the presence of robust tumor antigens
recognized by T cells, demonstrating that metabolic competition, as a distinct mechanism,
can lead to T cell hyporesponsiveness. Although we only directly address glucose in our
study, this model of resource competition likely extends beyond glucose. Availability of
amino acids, fatty acids, other metabolites and the presence of growth factors, other cell
types, and costimulatory signals that dictate whether T cells will express appropriate
transporters to allow nutrient acquisition, will all influence T cell function in tumors. We

focus on IFN-γ production from TILs, however, it is likely that a variety of effector
functions, in many immune cell types, might be dampened in a glucose-depleted
environment.

Author Manuscript

It makes sense that nutrient competition in a tumor shapes the ability of immune cells to
perform in that environment. T cells are primed in lymphoid tissues, which are likely
nutrient-replete, and traffic to inflammatory sites where they must compete with other cells
for resources. There they could experience nutrient deprivation that impairs their function,
but not necessarily their survival, leading to hyporesponsiveness and cancer progression. It
was shown that TILs specific for defined P tumor antigens infiltrate the P sarcoma prior to
checkpoint blockade, however these cells do not produce IFN-γ until after therapy (Gubin et
al., 2014), suggesting that conditions in the microenvironment, even when antigen is
recognized, can dampen T cell function. This view is consistent with the idea that T cell
activation and costimulation remodel metabolism, endowing the cell with features that allow
it to efficiently compete for nutrients, e.g. Glut1 expression (Jacobs et al., 2008). It is not
coincidental that CD28 signaling – the very process that prevents T cell anergy – functions
to increase glucose uptake (Frauwirth et al., 2002). Tregs and M2 macrophages, neither of
which require aerobic glycolysis but instead use fatty acid oxidation (Huang et al., 2014;
Michalek et al., 2011; Vats et al., 2006), may often appear in progressing tumors because
they can likely survive in low glucose environments. This is also consistent with
observations that M1 macrophages and effector T cells, both of which use glycolysis for
function (Pearce et al., 2013), appear in regressing tumors, which might be relatively
glucose-replete.

Our data suggest that glucose, which is stably regulated in metazoans, can become limiting
for T cells in the tumor microenvironment. We demonstrate that differences in glucose
acquisition between tumors do not necessarily relate to proliferation differences. It is
intriguing to speculate that enhanced glucose acquisition, or even glycogen storage, is
selected for by tumors (Favaro et al., 2012) to deprive T cells of glucose and thus reduce the
effectiveness of the antitumor response. Our understanding of how competition for
resources, including basic nutrients, is dynamically regulated in a particular niche and how
this imposes functional changes in cells is only beginning to develop.

Author Manuscript

Aerobic glycolysis is required for T cells to attain full effector status, which is regulated by
the bi-functional enzyme GAPDH (Chang et al., 2013). When glucose is present, GAPDH
engages in its enzymatic function; when cells are glucose-restricted, GAPDH becomes
available to bind the 3′UTR of IFN-γ mRNA, preventing its efficient translation. When T
cells are glucose-restricted for shorter times, cytokine production can be rescued by
reintroducing glucose, as GAPDH will re-engage in glycolysis. However, our preliminary
observations indicate that if T cells experience prolonged nutrient deprivation, dampened
cytokine production becomes relatively irreversible, leading to more permanent dysfunction
that cannot be corrected through simple re-exposure to nutrients. Strategies to elevate
glucose in an established tumor may not necessarily reverse TIL hyporesponsiveness. TILs
might be unable to respond to glucose readily, for example, if they have not maintained
Glut1 expression. Also, if the metabolic balance between tumors and TILs is not perturbed
in favor of the T cells prior to glucose exposure, the tumor will likely continue to

outcompete the T cells, even when more available glucose is present (O’Sullivan and Pearce,
2015). Our current studies are aimed at understanding how metabolic restrictions in vivo can
lead to long-term hyporesponsiveness in T cells.

Author Manuscript

We envisage that the various states of T cell hyporesponsiveness that have been described in
cancer and infection may be induced by an initial metabolic restriction. This could manifest
from a shortage of glucose, any signal, or lack of signal, to the T cell that abrogates its
ability to acquire glucose. If this model were correct, then there might only be a narrow
window of time during which T cells already present in a tumor could be targeted to regain
function. Strategies that aim to deplete tumor-promoting immune cells in a tumor, coupled
with those that promote glycolysis in newly infiltrating T cells, may be the most effective
way to metabolically remodel the tumor microenvironment. This could explain why
combining checkpoint blockade therapies that target CTLA-4, which depletes tumor Treg
cells (Simpson et al., 2013), with those against PD-1, are particularly effective (Hamid et al.,
2013; Wolchok et al., 2013).
Our data suggest that checkpoint blockade antibodies that affect glucose metabolism might
be most effective against tumors with higher glycolytic rates. It is likely that tumors that rely
more on OXPHOS and use diverse substrates for fuel might not starve the microenvironment
of glucose and thus would be less affected by these therapies. These results could explain
why these therapies do not work for some patients. We are investigating whether the
glycolytic rate of a tumor could be used as a prognostic tool to determine the efficacy of
these treatments.

Our finding that PD-L1 regulates tumor metabolism was serendipitous. Although PD-L1 is
known to inhibit T cells via PD-1, it has remained unclear whether it serves additional
biological advantages for tumors (Carlsson and Issazadeh-Navikas, 2014). Consistent with
our findings that PD-L1 has T cell independent function, it has been shown that neurons can
inhibit astrocytoma cell proliferation (Hatten and Shelanski, 1988), and that killing of
murine glioblastoma cells is dependent on expression and activity of PD-L1 on neurons
(Issazadeh-Navikas, 2013; Kingwell, 2013). The precise mechanism by which these events
occur is unknown, however PD-L1 might confer higher glycolysis to one cell type, e.g.
neurons, which allowed them to deplete glucose from, and subsequently lead to the
dampened survival of another cell type, e.g. cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

The 30 amino acid cytoplasmic tail of PD-L1 is highly conserved, which suggests functional
significance (Francisco et al., 2010; Keir et al., 2008). Our data show that PD-L1 shRNAmediated knockdown phenocopies our results with PD-L1 blockade antibody, which
decreases expression of surface PD-L1 via receptor internalization. Experiments are
underway to identify how surface PD-L1 signals to Akt and mTOR, and which proteins
might be involved in this process. It is conceivable that the cytoplasmic tail of PD-L1 is
phosphorylated directly and interacts with other proteins that relay information to mTOR.
Likewise, it is also possible that PD-L1 sits in a cell membrane domain that promotes its
association with other signaling proteins. This would not necessarily be dependent on any
signaling capacity inherent to the cytoplasmic domain, but rather accessory proteins could
signal to mTOR. We envisage that if PD-L1 is not expressed at the surface, its association

Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 September 10.

Chang et al.

with other proteins in the membrane is destabilized, and signaling to mTOR is blunted.
More work is required to determine exactly how PD-L1 signals.
In summary, we have shown that glucose competition between tumors and T cells can
directly influence cancer progression and have discovered an unexpected role for PD-L1 in
regulating tumor cell metabolism. New efforts to target cancer should incorporate the idea
that metabolic competition occurs in tumors and this can influence tumor progression.
Future therapies may consider combining treatments that dampen tumor metabolism with
those that enhance TIL nutrient acquisition in order to promote optimal antitumor immunity.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Mice and tumor transplantation

Author Manuscript

129S6 mice from Taconic Farms and C57BL/6 mice from The Jackson Laboratory were
used for all experiments. Unless otherwise indicated, 1–2×106 R or P tumor cells were
injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the right flank of mice. Sarcoma tumors were excised
from mice at ~12 days (d10–d13) post-transplantation. Isolated tumors were chopped and
digested in type IA collagenase and DNase I at 37°C.
In vivo checkpoint blockade treatment
Tumor bearing mice were injected i.p. with 200 μg of αCTLA4 (9H10) or αPD-1
(RMP1-14) or αPD-L1 (10F.9G2) or with isotype control antibodies on days 3, 6, and 9 after
tumor transplantation.
Metabolism assay

Author Manuscript

OCR and ECAR were analyzed on a XF96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse
Bioscience). Cells were plated in nonbuffered RPMI 1640 media with 25 mM glucose.
Measurements were obtained under basal conditions and after the addition of 1 μM
oligomycin (maximum glycolytic capacity).
Transduction
Tumor cells were transduced with GFP-reporting virus expressing shRNA against luciferase
(Ctrl hp) or shRNA against CD274 (PD-L1 hp) in media containing 8 μg/ml Polybrene
(Sigma) and 20 mM HEPES (Hyclone) for 5h, followed by additional transduction with the
same virus overnight. Transduced tumor cells were sorted by GFP expression. R tumor cells
were transduced with retrovirus expressing c-Myc, PDK1, Glut1, or HK2, or with empty
vector.

Author Manuscript

Glucose assay
Glucose concentrations in the supernatant were measured by the Glucose Assay Kit (Eton
Bioscience). For ex vivo glucose levels, harvested tumors were weighed and minced in fixed
amounts of PBS. Glucose concentration was quantified in accordance with the weight of
tumors and the volume of collected supernatant, and normalized with glucose concentrations
in R tumors.
