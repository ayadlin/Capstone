ABSTRACT
AR signaling is essential for the growth and survival of prostate cancer (PCa),
including most of the lethal castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). We previously reported
that TGF-β signaling in prostate stroma promotes prostate tumor angiogenesis
and growth. By using a PCa/stroma co-culture model, here we show that stromal
TGF-β signaling induces comprehensive morphology changes of PCa LNCaP cells.
Furthermore, it induces AR activation in LNCaP cells in the absence of significant
levels of androgen, as evidenced by induction of several AR target genes including
PSA, TMPRSS2, and KLK4. SD-208, a TGF-β receptor 1 specific inhibitor, blocks this
TGF-β induced biology. Importantly, stromal TGF-β signaling together with DHT induce
robust activation of AR. MDV3100 effectively blocks DHT-induced, but not stromal
TGF-β signaling induced AR activation in LNCaP cells, indicating that stromal TGF-β
signaling induces both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent AR activation in
PCa. TGF-β induces the expression of several growth factors and cytokines in prostate
stromal cells, including IL-6, and BMP-6. Interestingly, BMP-6 and IL-6 together
induces robust AR activation in these co-cultures, and neutralizing antibodies against
BMP-6 and IL-6 attenuate this action. Altogether, our study strongly suggests tumor
stromal microenvironment induced AR activation as a direct mechanism of CRPC.

of AR splice variants, enhanced AR co-regulators
signaling, alterations in steroid metabolism, growth factor
and/or cytokine induced AR activation etc [1]. Tumor
microenvironment also plays critical roles in regulating
prostate cancer progression [2]. Prostate cancer is enriched
in reactive stromal microenvironment, including reactive
myofibroblasts that are uniquely presented in wound repair
and tumor microenvironment [3–5]. Transforming Growth
Factor β (TGF-β) is generally overexpressed in most
carcinomas associated with a reactive stroma, including
breast, colon, and prostate [3, 6–9]. Overexpression of
TGF-β in carcinoma cells is usually associated with a downregulation of functional TGF-β receptors in carcinoma cells
but not in stromal cells [9–12]. Subcutaneous injection
of TGF-β1 is sufficient to induce a stromal reaction with

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly
diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer
death in American men. AR signaling is essentially
required for most human prostate cancers. Therefore, ADT
is the standard treatment for advanced and metastatic PCa.
Most prostate tumors initially respond to ADT therapy.
However, most tumors will relapse and become the
castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Currently, there is no
cure for CRPC. Interestingly, AR signaling is re-activated
in most CRPC tumors in the presence of castration level
of androgen ligands. Hence, AR remains as a major
therapeutic target for CRPC.
Several molecular mechanisms may count for
this AR re-activation in CRPC, including AR gene

differentiation to myofibroblasts, enhanced collagen
production and stimulated angiogenesis [13, 14]. Therefore,
TGF-β1 may be a key factor inducing a reactive stroma in
wound repair and cancer. By using the differential reactive
stroma (DRS) xenograft model [15–18], we have shown
that human prostate stromal cells differentially promote rate
of PCa progression [15]. By conditional knockout of TGF-β
Receptor II (TβRII) and overexpression of a dominant
negative Smad3 in prostate stromal cells in LNCaP DRS
xenograft model, we have demonstrated that Smad3mediated TGF-β signaling in prostate stroma promotes
prostate tumor growth and angiogenesis [16, 18] and this
stromal TGF-β action is partially mediated by Connective
Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) and Fibroblast Growth
Factor 2 (FGF-2) signaling [17, 18]. Therefore, TGF-β
signaling in prostate stroma regulates PCa progression.
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that
play important roles in regulating immune system and
inflammation. It is also a key cytokine in regulating human
cancers, including PCa [19]. Serum IL-6 level is associated
with PCa progression and metastasis [20, 21]. Functionally,
IL-6 can induce AR expression and AR activation, and
promote PCa cell growth [22–28]. IL-6 has also been
shown to promote castration-resistance of PCa including
that to enzalutamide (MDV3100, a second-generation
antiandrogen) [25, 28, 29]. Interestingly, the circulating
levels of both IL-6 and TGF-β1 were elevated in patients
with metastatic PCa [30]. Bone morphogenetic proteins
(BMPs) play important roles in inducing bone formation.
BMP-6 expression is frequently elevated in PCa [31].
It can promote PCa bone metastases and its expression
is associated with a more invasive phenotype [32, 33].
Interestingly, two most recent studies revealed a role of
BMP-6 in promoting castration-resistance of PCa [34, 35].
In this report, we used direct co-cultures of LNCaP
cells with three different human prostate stromal cell lines
to show that prostate stroma-specific TGF-β signaling
induces AR activation in LNCaP cells in the absence
of significant amount of androgens, and that treatment
of MDV3100, a second-generation antiandrogen [36],
only partially attenuates this AR activation. Our study
also revealed robust cooperative activity between
stromal TGF-β signaling and DHT ligand in inducing
AR activation in PCa cells. Finally, we showed that IL-6
and BMP-6 together induces robust AR activation, and
that they partially mediate this prostate stromal TGF-β
signaling induced AR activation in PCa cells.

LNCaP cells overexpressing an HA-tagged constitutively
activated TGF-β1 ligand (LNCaP-TGF-β1(a)) and control
LNCaP cells (LNCaP-Ctrl) as described before [37].
We then performed in vitro PCa/stroma co-cultures by
plating LNCaP-TGF-β1(a) cells or LNCaP-Ctrl cells on
top of the mostly confluent HPS-19I cells, a previously
generated human prostate stromal cell line [38]. Since
LNCaP cells are defective in TGF-β receptor I (TβRI/
ALK-5) that is essential for mediating TGF-β signaling
[39], only HPS19I cells can respond to TGF-β ligand in
these co-cultures. This provides a unique opportunity to
study how prostate stromal cell-specific TGF-β signaling
regulates PCa biology. We performed these co-cultures
in 0.2% FBS containing minimal amount of growth
factors and cytokines for up to 28 days. We found that
while the LNCaP-Ctrl cells remained relatively flat,
LNCaP-TGF-β1(a) cells formed sphere-like structures
in these co-cultures (Figure 1a & b, Supplementary
Figure 1), indicating that prostate stromal cell-specific
TGF-β signaling induces profound biological changes in
LNCaP cells.
SD-208 is a TβRI (ALK-5) protein kinase-specific
inhibitor [40]. To determine its efficacy in inhibiting
TGF-β signaling in HPS19I cells, we transfected HPS19I
cells with a (CAGA)12MLP (Smad binding sequence)
reporter construct [41] and a pRL-null vector (Promega,
control for transfection efficiency). We then treated
these cells with 50 pM of TGF-β1 along with different
dosages of SD-208. TGF-β1 induced a 25-fold increase
in (CAGA)12MLP reporter activity in the transfected
HPS19I cells, and this induction was inhibited by
SD-208 compound in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1e).
400 nM of SD-208 abolished TGF-β signaling in HPS19I
cells, thus was used in the co-culture experiments (Figure 1c
and 1d). Consistent with its TGF-β signaling inhibition
activity, 400 nM of SD-208 treatment blocked the LNCaPTGF-β1(a) cells from forming sphere-like structures in the
LNCaP-TGF-β1(a)/HPS19I co-cultures (Figure 1d).

changes in LNCaP/HPS19I co-cultures
To explore how prostate stroma-specific TGF-β
signaling regulates LNCaP cell biology in these
co-cultures, we carried out cDNA microarray study to
compare differential gene expression among (1) control
treated LNCaP-Ctrl/HPS19I co-cultures, (2) 400 nM
of SD-208 treated LNCaP-Ctrl/HPS19I co-cultures,
(3) control treated LNCaP-TGF-β1(a)/HPS19I co-cultures,
and (4) 400 nM of SD-208 treated LNCaP-TGF-β1(a)/
HPS19I co-cultures. After 6-day treatment, total RNAs
were directly extracted from these co-cultures from two
independent studies, reverse transcribed, and submitted
for microarray analysis using the 4x44K Whole Human
Genome Oligo Microarray chip (Agilent Technologies).
We found that 187 transcripts representing 136 unique

genes were differentially expressed among these groups
(ANOVA P<0.001, standard deviation > 0.2), including
79 unique genes (in red) that were induced by TGF-β,
but blocked or reversed by SD-208 treatment, as well as
23  genes (in green) that were repressed by TGF-β, but
blocked or reversed by SD-208 treatment (Figure 1f). The
most significantly upregulated genes in these LNCaP-TGFβ1(a)/HPS19I co-cultures include TIMP3, COMP, FN1,
TSPAN2, CILP, TNFAIP6, ENC1, CDKN2B, MRAS,
LTBP2, LOX, POSTN, LRRC32 etc., as well as notably
KLK3 (PSA), a prostate epithelial cell specific marker
and an AR target gene (Table 1a). The most significantly
downregulated genes include UGT2B17, FAM111A,
ZNF294, ANK3, MAPRE2 etc. (Table 1b). Control and
SD-208 treated LNCaP-TGF-β1(a)/HPS19I co-cultures all

exhibited overexpression of nine transcripts, all of which
represent TGF-β1, the ectopically overexpressed gene in
LNCaP-TGF-β1(a) cells.
In order to identify the prostate epithelia-specific
gene that was regulated by prostate stromal TGF-β
signaling, we also treated HPS19I cells alone using
conditioned media collected from LNCaP-TGF-β1(a)
cells or LNCaP-Ctrl cells cultured in RPMI1640
supplemented with 0.2% FBS. Conditional media, but not
TGF-β1 ligand, were used here to more closely simulate
the co-culture conditions. After 6 days of treatment,
we extracted total RNA from these HPS19I cells and
performed microarray. 2349 transcripts representing
1377 genes were differentially expressed among these
two treatment groups (fold change>1.5, Figure 1g).

the LNCaP-TGF-β1 (a)  /  HPS19I cell co-cultures,
but not expressed in HPS19I cells when cultured
alone. Furthermore, SD-208 treatment blocked this
induction (Table 1a).

cells (data not shown) or HPS19I cells cultured alone
(Figure 2a). Furthermore, these inductions were blocked
by addition of 400 nM of SD-208, further confirming that
TβRI (ALK5) protein kinase activity in the HPS19I cells
was required for TGF-β ligand induced AR activation in
LNCaP cells (Figure 2a).
To further reduce androgen levels, we also
performed LNCaP-TGF-β1(a)/HPS19I co-cultures
and LNCaP-Ctrl/HPS19I co-cultures in RPMI1640
media supplemented with 0.2% charcoal stripped FBS
deprived of androgen, and treated them with increasing
dosages of DHT and/or 10 μM of MDV3100, a secondgeneration antiandrogen [36], for six days. We similarly
extracted total RNA directly from these co-cultures,
and performed reverse transcription reactions and
qPCR analysis for PSA expression. As expected, DHT
induced PSA expression in the control LNCaP-Ctrl/
HPS19I co-cultures in a dose-dependent manner. We
also unexpectedly observed that MDV3100 treatment
somehow modestly induced PSA expression in these
LNCaP-Ctrl/HPS19I co-cultures maintained in 0.2%
charcoal stripped FBS, whereas the AR antagonist activity
of MDV3100 was confirmed by its strong inhibition of
10 nM DHT induced PSA expression in these LNCaPCtrl/HPS19I co-cultures (Figure 2b). Consistent with
the data obtained in LNCaP/HPS19I co-cultures in 0.2%
FBS (Figure 2a), PSA expression in the LNCaP-TGFβ1(a)/HPS19I co-cultures in 0.2% charcoal-stripped
FBS was also greatly induced, to levels comparable to
10nM DHT induced PSA expression in LNCaP-Ctrl/
HPS19I co-cultures. These observations further confirmed
prostate stroma-specific TGF-β signaling induction of
AR activation in the absence of significant amount of
androgen. Addition of DHT dose-dependently promoted
PSA expression in these LNCaP-TGF-β1(a)/HPS19I cocultures, with robust induction observed in 1 nM and 10
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

nM of DHT treatments, indicating strong cooperative or
additive actions between the stromal TGF-β signaling
induced AR activation and the DHT ligand-induced AR
activation. Consistent with the AR antagonist activity,
10 μM of MDV3100 robustly blocked 1nM and 10 nM
DHT-induced PSA expression in the LNCaP-TGF-β1(a)/
HPS19I co-cultures. In contrast, MDV3100 treatment only
modestly reduced stromal TGF-β signaling induced PSA
expression in the absence of externally added DHT ligand,
indicating that a large fraction of stromal TGF-β signaling
induced AR activation is ligand-independent (Figure 2b).
Finally, LNCaP-TGF-β1(a) cells and LNCaP-Ctrl cells
expressed comparable levels of basal and DHT-induced
PSA (Supplementary Figure 2), further confirming that
stroma-specific TGF-β signaling is essential for inducing
AR activation in LNCaP cells in these co-cultures.
To confirm that our observed stromal TGF-β
signaling induced PSA expression is AR dependent,
we performed knockdown of AR in LNCaP-Ctrl and
LNCaP-TGF-β1(a) cells using two independent siRNAs
against human AR. Western blots confirmed significant
knockdown of AR in both cell lines (Figure 2c). These
AR-knockdown LNCaP cells were used for co-cultures
with HPS19I cells in RPMI1640 media supplemented with
0.2% charcoal stripped FBS for four days. We extracted
total RNA directly from these co-cultures, and performed
reverse transcription reactions and qPCR analysis for PSA
expression. Indeed, knockdown of AR in LNCaP cells
greatly inhibited PSA expression in these co-cultures,
confirming that stromal TGF-β signaling induced PSA
expression is dependent on AR (Figure 2d).
To further expand our observation, we also
performed co-cultures of LNCaP cells with HTS33B
cells and HPS33Q cells, two additional human prostate
stromal cell lines that we prepared following a previously
described protocol [5, 38]. These LNCaP/HTS33B

co-cultures and LNCaP/HPS33Q co-cultures were treated
with 50 pM of TGF-β1 or vehicle control in RMPI1640
supplemented with 0.2% charcoal stripped FBS for six
days. Total RNA was similarly directly extracted from
these co-cultures, reverse transcribed, and used for qPCR
analysis for gene expression. We showed that TGF-β
treatment induced the expression of PSA, KLK4, and
TMPRSS2 in all these co-cultures, further confirming that
prostate stromal cell-specific TGF-β signaling induces AR
activation in LNCaP cells (Figure 3b, c).

Finally, to further evaluate the functional roles of
IL-6 and BMP-6 in mediating stromal TGF-β signaling
induced AR activation in LNCaP cells, we treated the
LNCaP/HTS33B and LNCaP/HPS33Q co-cultures with
IL-6 and BMP-6 neutralizing antibodies. Use of IL-6
neutralizing antibody produced an apparent reduction in
stromal TGF-β signaling induced AR activation in LNCaP
cells, whereas BMP-6 neutralizing antibody attenuated
this induction to a less extent (Figure 4a, b). Altogether,
these data suggest that IL-6 and BMP-6 mediate prostate
stromal TGF-β signaling induced AR activation.

IL-6 and BMP-6 activity partially mediates
prostate stromal TGF-β signaling induced AR
activation in LNCaP cells

DISCUSSION
Tumor microenvironment is important for prostate
cancer progression. TGF-β is a key cytokine in regulating
cancer progression, either by directly regulating tumor
cells, such as inducing epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT), or indirectly by regulating tumor
microenvironment, such as inducing extracellular matrix
remodeling, regulating angiogenesis as well as immune
responses. We showed here that TGF-β could indirectly
induce AR activation in PCa cells through directly
modulating stromal cells in tumor microenvironment.
Since AR re-activation is requisite for the recurrence
of most CRPC tumors, this stromal TGF-β signaling
induced AR activation in PCa cells may provide a direct
mechanism for CRPC. Importantly, stromal TGF-β
signaling greatly potentiated and enhanced DHT-induced
AR activation, suggesting that it might be a therapeutic
target to inhibit AR activation in CRPC tumors in the
presence of castration-levels of androgen.
Our current data suggest that IL-6 and BMP-6 might
partially mediate stromal TGF-β signaling induced AR
activation. Interestingly, although neither IL-6 nor BMP-6
could robustly induce AR activation in LNCaP cells
when cultured alone, IL-6 and BMP-6 together greatly
enhance AR activity in these cells. Notably, when prostate
stromal cells are presented in the LNCaP/stromal cell
co-cultures, IL-6 and BMP-6 can each significantly
enhance AR activation in LNCaP cells, which may
attribute to the basal activation of IL-6 and BMP-6
signaling pathway in these co-cultures. As the
expression of IL-6 and BMP-6 are elevated in the tumor
microenvironment, these may be important factors in the
evolution of castration resistant disease.
Consistent with many previous reports, MDV3100
showed robust AR antagonist activities in most of
our LNCaP/HPS19I co-cultures studies. However,
MDV3100 also exhibited slight apparent AR agonist
activity under certain experimental conditions, such as
in LNCaP/HPS19I cell co-cultured in 0.2% of charcoalstripped FBS as described in Figure 2. The nature and
significance of this unexpected slight AR agonist activity
of MDV3100 is still to be determined. Finally, stromal
TGF-β signaling induced AR activation in LNCaP

IL-6 is a key cytokine regulating PCa biology,
including inducing AR activity and promoting androgenindependent growth [22–25]. BMP-6 was recently
reported to promote castration-resistant PCa [34, 35]. We
found that TGF-β induces the expression of both IL-6
and BMP-6 in human prostate stromal cells cultured in
0.2% charcoal stripped FBS (Figure 3a). To examine
whether IL-6 and/or BMP-6 mediate the stromal TGF-β
signaling induced AR activation in LNCaP cells, we first
treated LNCaP/HTS33B co-cultures and LNCaP/HPS33Q
co-cultures in RMPI1640 supplemented with 0.2% charcoal
stripped FBS with 25 ng/ml of IL-6 and/or 50 ng/ml of
BMP-6 for six days. While IL-6 treatment and BMP-6
treatment each can induce PSA expression in all these
co-cultures, co-treatments of both IL-6 and BMP-6 robustly
induced PSA expression to levels exceeding those induced
by TGF-β treatment. These results indicate that IL-6 and
BMP-6 together strongly induces AR activation in LNCaP
cells and that this action may greatly contribute to stromal
TGF-β signaling induced AR activation in LNCaP cells.
We next examined whether the presence of prostate
stromal cells is required for the IL-6/BMP-6 induced
AR activation in LNCaP cells. In contrast to our above
observations in the co-culture system, neither IL-6
treatment alone nor BMP-6 treatment alone can greatly
enhance PSA expression in LNCaP cells cultured alone
in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 0.2% charcoal
stripped FBS. However, co-treatments of both IL-6 and
BMP-6 induced robust expression of PSA in the LNCaP
-only cell cultures, further confirming the cooperative
activities of IL-6 and BMP-6 in inducing AR activation in
LNCaP cells (Figure 3b, c). We made similar observations
in KLK4 expression, but not in TMPRSS2 expression, in
these IL-6 and BMP-6 treated LNCaP/stromal co-cultures
as well as in LNCaP cells cultured alone (Figure 3b, c).
These data suggest that although IL-6 and BMP-6 may
greatly contribute to stromal TGF-β signaling induced AR
activities including inducing PSA and KLK4 expression,
additional signaling molecules/pathways may be required
for mediating stromal TGF-β signaling induced other AR
activities such as inducing TMPRSS2 expression.

cells can only be partially attenuated by treatment of
MDV3100 (Figure 2), indicating both ligand-dependent
and ligand-independent AR activation. Interestingly,
our microarray study and qPCR analysis revealed that
stromal TGF-β signaling strongly repressed expression
of UGT2B17 (Table 1b), as well as UGT2B15 (data
not shown), two key epithelium-specific UDPglucuronosyltransferases for glucuronidation and
inactivation of testosterone and DHT ligands for their
efficient clearance from normal prostate epithelial cells
as well as PCa cells [42, 43]. These suggest a possibility
that repression of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 in PCa cells
may contribute to stromal TGF-β signaling induced
ligand-dependent AR activation in PCa cells, which

warrants future studies on the functional roles of these
two UDP-glucuronosyltransferases in regulating prostate
stroma induced AR activation in PCa cells.

from Selleckchem (Houston, TX, USA). SD-208
was obtained from Scios, Inc. (now Alza Corporation
Vacaville, CA, USA; part of Johnson and Johnson).

HPS19I, HTS33B, and HPS33Q cells were first
allowed to grow in Bfs media to confluence on 6 well
plates. LNCaP cells were then plated on top of the stromal
cells at 1X105 cells per well and subjected to various
treatments in RPMI1640 supplemented with 0.2% FBS or
charcoal stripped FBS for 6 to 28 days. The treatments
include 50 pM (1.25ng/ml) porcine TGF-β1 (R&D
Systems), 400 nM of SD-208, 0.1, 1, and 10 nM of DHT
(Sigma), 10 μM of MDV3100 (Selleckchem, Houston,

of IL-6 neutralizing antibody, 2 μg/ml of IL-6 neutralizing
antibody (R&D system), and various vehicle controls.
When applicable, LNCaP cells and prostate stromal cells
were each similarly cultured and treated as those for the
LNCaP/Stroma co-cultures. Total RNA was extracted from
these co-cultures using the RNeasy Miniprep kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA) or TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen).

Cell cultures
LNCaP cells were purchased from ATCC and
cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS

with reference cDNA and purified with SuperScript
Plus Direct cDNA Labeling System purification module
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Eluted sample
was mixed with 10xBlocking Solution and 2xHiRPM

incubated for 2 min at 95–98° C and hybridized on
4x44K Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray
chip using SureHyb DNA Microarray Hybridization
Chambers in DNA Microarray hybridization
oven (Agilent Technologies) at 10 rpm, 65°C for

Expression Wash Buffer 1 and 2 for 1 min and than dried
by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 2 min. Microarrays
were scanned with a dynamic autofocus microarray
scanner (Agilent Microarray Scanner- G2565BA, Agilent
Technologies,) using Agilent-provided parameters
(Red and Green PMT were each set at 100%, and scan
resolution was set to 5 um). The Feature Extraction
Software v9.1.3.1 (Agilent Technologies) was used to
extract and analyze the signals.
The microarray data were processed using
bioconductor (loess normalization), with Combat to adjust
for batch effects [44]. Fold changes and ANOVA tests for
each gene were computed using log-transformed values.
Array data have been deposited into the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GSE51624).

were treated with 50 pM TGF-β1 and different dosages
of SD-208 compound for 24 hours. Cell lysates were
prepared and measured for luciferase activity using the
Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay system (Promega).
The reporter firefly luciferase activity was normalized to

of SD-208 or vehicle control for 6 days. Conditioned
media from LNCaP-TGF-β1(a) cells and LNCaP-Ctrl
cells maintained in RPMI1640 supplemented with
0.2% FBS were also collected and used to treat HPS19I
cells for 6 days. Total RNA was extracted from these
LNCaP-TGF-β1(a)/HPS19I and LNCaP-Ctrl/HPS19I
co-cultures and from the differentially treated HPS19I
cells using the RNeasy Miniprep kit (Qiagen). The
cDNA reverse transcription and fluorescent labeling
reactions were carried out using the SuperScript® Plus
Direct cDNA Labeling System with Alexa Fluor®
aha-dUTPs kit (Invitrogen). Briefly 3 μg of RNA and
3 μg of Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene,
La Jolla, CA) were labeled in reverse transcription with
Alexa647 and Alexa555 aha-dUTPs respectively for
