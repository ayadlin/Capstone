ABSTRACT
PIG7 localizes to lysosomal membrane in leukemia cells. Our previous work has
shown that transduction of pig7 into a series of leukemia cell lines did not result
in either apoptosis or differentiation of most tested cell lines. Interestingly, it did
significantly sensitize these cell lines to chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we further
investigated the mechanism underlying pig7-induced improved sensitivity of acute
leukemia cells to chemotherapy. Our results demonstrated that the sensitization
effect driven by exogenous pig7 was more effective in drug-resistant leukemia cell
lines which had lower endogenous pig7 expression. Overexpression of pig7 did
not directly activate the caspase apoptotic pathway, but decreased the lysosomal
stability. The expression of pig7 resulted in lysosomal membrane permeabilization
(LMP) and lysosomal protease (e.g. cathepsin B, D, L) release. Moreover, we also
observed increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased mitochondrial
membrane potential (ΔΨm) induced by pig7. Some autophagy markers such as LC3I/
II, ATG5 and Beclin-1, and necroptosis maker MLKL were also stimulated. However,
intrinsic antagonism such as serine/cysteine protease inhibitors Spi2A and Cystatin
C prevented downstream effectors from triggering leukemia cells, which were only
on the “verge of apoptosis”. When combined with chemotherapy, LMP increased and
more proteases were released. Once this process was beyond the limit of intrinsic
antagonism, it induced programmed cell death cooperatively via caspase-independent
and caspase-dependent pathways.

INTRODUCTION

[4, 5]. In a previous study, we used PCR and restriction
endonucleases to identify transcripts in ten leukemia cell
lines (K562, HL60, U937, NB4, Kasumi-1, SKNO-1,
KG1a, Nalm-6, Jurkat and Raji) as well as primary cells
derived from the bone marrow of acute leukemia patients
[6]. The results suggest that the SIMPLE transcript was
the only one present, while the expression of LITAF was
undetectable. Moreover, SIMPLE expression in leukemia
cells was found to be lower than in healthy cells. When
these leukemia cells were treated with chemotherapeutic
drugs (e.g. PB, ATRA, and VP16), we found a significant
increase (22.5–27.8 times) in endogenous expression of
pig7 during cellular apoptosis. These results indicated

Pig7 (P53 induced gene 7) was initially believed to
be one of the key genes involved in P53-induced apoptosis,
serving as a bridge between P53 expression and apoptosis
[1]. It was later found that Pig7 had two completely
different transcripts: LITAF (LPS-Induced TNF Alpha
Factor) and SIMPLE (Small Integral Membrane Protein of
Lysosome/late Endosome). LITAF acts as a transcriptional
promoter in LPS-induced TNF alpha expression [2, 3],
and SIMPLE functions as an intrinsic protein in the early
endosomal/lysosomal membrane. However, its functions
within these membranes are not clearly understood

that pig7 may be closely related to cellular apoptosis.
When pig7 was transfected into K562, HL60, NB4,
Raji, Kasumi-1 and SKNO-1 cells, we found that for
most leukemia cells, overexpression of pig7 did not
directly affect either their proliferation or differentiation.
Furthermore, any pig7-induced promotion of apoptosis
was also not evident. However, when combined with
chemotherapies such as using VP16 and daunorubicin, we
found that there was a significant enhancement in the drug
sensitivity of the tested leukemia cells [6, 7].
In recent years, increasing evidence has shown
that pig7 can inhibit tumor growth and that the causal
mechanism may be involved in the regulation of
cellular apoptosis [8–10]. As we have confirmed that
the only pig7 transcript present in leukemia cells is the
SIMPLE transcript—which is localized in the lysosomal
membrane— and we speculated that the chemosensitivity
promoting effects of pig7 may be associated with the
lysosome.
In the present study, we transfected pig7 into two
kinds of leukemia cell lines (K562, HL60), two kinds
of drug-resistant leukemia cell lines (K562/ADM, and
HL60/ADM), and five cases of acute myeloid leukemia
primary cells. We found that the sensitization effect
driven by exogenous pig7 was more effective in K562/
ADM and HL60/ADM which had lower endogenous pig7
expression compared with other cells. High expression
of exogenous PIG7 induced lysosomal membrane
permeabilization (LMP) and PIG7 translocated into the
cytosol and proteases (e.g. cathepsins) were subsequently
released into the cytosol. Meanwhile, the levels of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane
potential (ΔΨm) were found to be significantly changed.
Expressions of autophagy markers such as LC3I/II,
ATG5 and Beclin-1 and necroptosis marker MLKL also
increased. Interestingly, in parallel to alteration of these
cell death signals, neither apoptosis was present nor did
the expression of caspase show any obvious changes. So
we further searched intrinsic antagonisms which prevented
downstream effectors from triggering death of leukemia
cells, and we found with the release of cathepsins into
the cytosol, the endogenous expression of serine/cysteine
protease inhibitors such as Spi2A and Cystatin C increased
simultaneously. That may be an intrinsic antagonism
which protected leukemia cells. However, when combined
with chemotherapy, LMP significantly increased; more
proteases were released, and more ROS were formed.
When beyond the limit of intrinsic antagonism, PIG7 can
induce cellular apoptosis and necroptosis. In addition,
cathepsin inhibitors (e.g. CA-074Me, pepstatin A and
E64D) and antioxidants (e.g. N-acetylcysteine and
α-toco) both provided significant protection on cells from
programmed cell death by the combination of PIG7 and
chemotherapy. Further, the caspase inhibitor Z-VADFMK and necroptosis inhibitor Necrosulfonamide (NSA)
did not afford the same protection when used alone, but
could have a significant protective effect when used
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in combination, confirming caspase-dependent and
-independent cell death pathways were both involved in
this process.

RESULTS
Endogenous pig7 expression levels are related to
its chemosensitivity-promoting effects
Previous studies from our group have shown that
for most leukemia cells (e.g. K562, NB4, Kasumi-1,
and SKNO-1), overexpression of pig7 can enhance their
chemotherapeutic sensitivity [6, 7]. In order to explore the
mechanism behind this effect, we selected two ordinary
leukemia cell lines (K562 and HL60), two chemotherapy
resistant cell lines (K562/ADM, HL60/ADM), and primary
bone marrow mononuclear cells from five acute myeloid
leukemia patients. We then transduced pig7 into these
cells via lentiviral delivery, using an experimental design
featuring a pig7 transduced group (Plent6.3-PIG7 group)
and an empty viral vector control group (Plent6.3 group).
At 48 h post-infection, the expression level of pig7 mRNA
was measured using real-time quantitative PCR and the
expression of PIG7 protein was detected using Western
blot. Changes in chemosensitivity were analyzed by MTT
assay and Annexin V staining. Strikingly, both endogenous
pig7 mRNA and protein expression levels were decreased
(*P < 0.001) (Figure 1A) in chemotherapy resistant cell
lines (K562/ADM and HL60/ADM). Among the primary
cells, Cells from patient 2 had the lowest expression of
endogenous pig7 while those from patient 4 had the highest
expression (*P < 0.001) (Figure 1B). After transfection
with lentivirus Plenti6.3-PIG7, the mRNA and protein
expressions of pig7 were both significantly increased,
reaching very high levels in all cells. However, protein
expression of pig7 showed no significant differences in
either the four kinds of cell lines or in the five cases of
primary cells. Overexpression of pig7 disproportionately
enhanced the chemosensitivity of these cells, with the
exception of the HL60 cell line. Among the four cell lines,
the IC50 values of VP16 and ADM at 48 h for K562/ADM
cells, which had the lowest expression of endogenous pig7,
were reduced from 407.3  μg/ml and 4.01 μg/ml for the
Plent6.3 group to 79.6 μg/ml and 0.28 μg/ml for the Pig7
groups, respectively. Their chemosensitivity also increased
5.1- and 14.3-fold, respectively. HL60 cells had a relatively
high endogenous expression of pig7 and the 48 h IC50 values
of both VP16 and ADM were not significantly changed
(**P > 0.05) (Figure 2A). In the five cases of primary cells,
patient 2 had the lowest expression of endogenous pig7 and
also had decreased IC50 at 48 h for both VP16 and ADM
(from 29.3 μg/ml and 1.19 μg/ml to 6.7 μg/ml and 0.12
μg/ml, respectively). Their chemosensitivity increased 4.3and 9.9-fold, respectively. In contrast to patient 2, patient
4 had the highest expression of endogenous pig7 and did
not have significant changes in IC50 of either VP16 or
ADM at 48 h. Their chemosensitivity only increased 1.34842

and 1.6-fold, respectively (Figure 2B). Annexin V staining
assay indicated that the largest increase in the apoptosis rate
(Annexin V+/7-AAD+ cells%) occurred in K562/ADM
and patient 2 primary cells treated with both Plent6.3-PIG7
and VP16 (39.7 ± 4.7% VS 16.9 ± 3.9%, 50.2 ± 4.8%
VS 25.4 ± 3.1%, respectively, *P < 0.01) (Figure 3A).
The  necroptosis rate increase (Annexin V−/7-AAD+
cells%) of these cells was also the highest (17.9 ± 2.3%
VS 5.9 ± 0.7%, 22.7 ± 3.7% VS 7.6 ± 1.3%, respectively,
*P < 0.01) (Figure 3B). However, in HL60 and patient
4 primary cells, the apoptosis rate was not significantly
changed (24.2 ± 3.4% VS 22.7 ± 3.1%, 31.2 ± 3.3% VS
29.8 ± 4.1%, respectively, **P > 0.05) (Figure 3A). The
increase in the necroptosis rate in these cells was also
very mild (10.2 ± 1.7% VS 7.9 ± 1.3%, 9.1 ± 1.5% VS 7.4
± 1.7%, respectively, **P < 0.05) (Figure 3B). Collectively,

these results indicate that the chemosensitivity promoting
effect of pig7 is widely varied in both different leukemia
cell lines and primary cells. Moreover, the expression level
of endogenous pig7 may have a strong negative correlation
with this observed chemosensitive effect.

Overexpression of pig7 induces lysosomal
membrane permeabilization (LMP) and
cytosolic cathepsin release
Our previous study demonstrated that PIG7
(SIMPLE) localized to the lysosomal membrane
in leukemia cells [6]. We thus speculated that the
chemosensitivity promoting effect observed in this
study may be associated with the lysosomal pathway.
We chose two chemotherapy resistant cell lines and

cell lines was significantly lower than in K562 and HL60 cell lines (*P < 0.01). (B) Patient 2 had the lowest expression of endogenous pig7
and Patient 4 had the highest expression (*P < 0.001). In all cells, high levels of pig7 product could be detected in the plent6.3-PIG7 group

primary cells derived from Patient 2 as in vitro models
and transduced pig7 into these cells by lentiviral delivery.
Our experimental design included a pig7 transduced group
(Plent6.3-PIG7 group), a group with a combination of
pig7 virus and VP16 (Plent6.3-PIG7 + VP16 group), an
empty virus group (Plent6.3 group), and a group with a
combination of empty virus and VP16 (Plent6.3-PIG7 +
VP16 group). At 48 and 72 h after infection, cells were
stained with the lysosomotropic agent AO and LMP was
monitored (i) qualitatively by fluorescence microscopy
and (ii) quantitatively by flow cytometry. In both
approaches, by measuring the fluorescence intensity of

the cells, with increased green fluorescence in the cytosol
indicating increased LMP. Since AO is a weak base, it
can move freely across membranes when uncharged and
accumulate in acidic compartments like lysosomes in its
protonated form. In these acidic compartments, it then
forms and aggregates that fluoresce bright red. LMP can
be monitored due to its metachromatic emission spectrum,
as an increase in diffuse cytosolic green fluorescence
occurs with a concomitant decrease in lysosomal red
fluorescence [11]. In our study, fluorescence microscopic
analysis of cells with AO revealed that a high percentage
of the Plent6.3 group (empty virus control) exhibited intact

cells, IC50 did not significantly change (**P > 0.05). (B) In the five cases of primary cells, the IC50 of VP16 and ADM for Patient 2 at 48 h
post-infection decreased by 4.3- and 9.9-fold (*), respectively. In Patient 2, the IC50 only decreased to 1.3- and 1.6-fold, respectively (**).

lysosomes (or, that the high levels of red fluorescence
corresponded to accumulation of AO within the acidic
lysosomes). Moreover, there was a reduced percentage of
the Plent6.3-PIG7 group with diffuse green fluorescence
(corresponding to non-lysosomal AO).
Contrastingly, overexpression of pig7 led to a
decrease in the percentage of cells with red fluorescence
and an associated increase in the percentage of cells with

green fluorescence. These parallel findings are indicative
of LMP (Figure 4A). Quantification of AO-stained cells
was performed by flow cytometry. AO green fluorescence
intensity of Plent6.3-PIG7 group was higher than the
empty virus control group. At 72 h post-infection, the
green fluorescence intensity of K562/ADM, HL60/ADM,
and patient 2 primary cells increased from approximately
27.5, 20.1, and 36.3 in the Plent6.3 groups to 63.1, 52.9,

Figure 3: Changes in apoptosis and necroptosis of leukemia cells after lentiviral infection and VP16 treatment
(48 h). Annexin V staining assay indicated that (A) the apoptosis rates of these four cell lines and five cases of primary cells infected with
Plent6.3-PIG7 lentivirus were not changed. When combined with differential concentrations of VP16, the apoptotic rate of these three cell
lines and four cases of primary cells significantly increased when compared with Plent6.3 control + VP16 groups. K562/ADM and Patient
2 has the highest increase in apoptosis rate (*). There was almost no change in apoptosis rate in either HL60 or Patient 4 cells (**P > 0.05)
(B) The necroptosis rate of cells infected with Plent6.3-PIG7 lentivirus was unchanged. When combined with VP16, the necroptosis rate of
all cells increased compared with Plent6.3 control + VP16 groups. K562/ADM and Patient 2 had the highest increases in their respective
necroptosis rates (*), while HL60 and Patient 4 had the lowest increases in their necroptosis rates (**).

and 67.2 in the Plent6.3-PIG7 groups, respectively. The
combination of VP16 contributed to further lysosomal
destabilization and aggravated LMP, resulting in the
Plent6.3-PIG7 + VP16 group with the highest green
fluorescence intensity (*P < 0.05) (Figure 4B).

After LMP, lysosomal proteases such as cathepsins
are released from lysosomes into the cytoso [12]. As such,
their detection in the cytosolic fraction is indicative of LMP.
We therefore collected treated cells at 72 h and isolated
lysosomes using a commercially available Lysosome

Enrichment Kit. The isolated lysosomes as well as the nonlysosomal lysate were collected for subsequent Western blot
analysis. We found that in the Plent6.3 group, the activated
Cathepsin B, Cathepsin D, and Cathepsin L proteins and
their precursors (pro-cathepsin B, D, L) were mainly
expressed in lysosomes and exhibited very low expression

levels in the cytosol. Notably, we found that overexpression
of pig7 led these activated cathepsins to be released into the
cytosol, indicating that it induced LMP. We also observed
that the combination of VP16 further aggravated LMP,
yielding the highest level of activated cathepsin expression
in the Plent6.3-PIG7 + VP16 group (Figure 5).

release from lysosomes, (ii) increased precursors pro-cathepsin in B, D, and L were cleaved to their active forms, but fewer precursors were
released into the cytosol, and (iii) the combination of VP16 further enhanced the above effects.

Cathepsin inhibitors and antioxidants protect
against cellular toxicity, but not caspase
inhibition

VP16 further increased ROS levels, such that the Plent6.3PIG7 + VP16 group had the highest DCF fluorescence
intensity (*P < 0.05) (Figure 9A). We then examined
the impact of antioxidants on these cells and examined
three groups, including an antioxidant α-tocopherol
(α-toco), antioxidant n-acetylcysteine (NAC), and DMSO
vehicle control. At 48 and 72 h after viral infection with
Plenti6.3-PIG7, we found that with the decrease of ROS,
both antioxidants increased leukemia cell viability (*P
< 0.05) (Figure 9B). Annexin V staining also indicated
that these two inhibitors had significant antagonistic
effects on apoptosis and necroptosis (*P < 0.05 for
both) (Figure 9C). These results suggest that ROS might
contribute to the chemosensitivity-promoting effects of
pig7.
As the caspase pathway has been extensively
studied as an underlying mechanism for apoptosis
[14, 15], we wished to examine whether it was involved
in the chemosensitivity-promoting effects of pig7. Western
blot analysis showed that the cleaved Caspase-9 and
cleaved Caspase-3 proteins exhibited (i) low levels in
both the Plent6.3-PIG7 experimental and Plent6.3 control
groups and (ii) there was no difference between the two
groups. Expression of Caspase 9/Apaf-1 complex was also
unchanged (Figure 7). These results indicate that although
overexpression of pig7 can induce LMP, decrease ΔΨm,
and increase ROS, it has no effect on the activation of the
caspase pathway.
We then examined the effect of the caspase inhibitor
Z-VAD-FMK on subsequent changes in chemosensitivity
using both a Z-VAD-FMK and DMSO control group.
Interestingly, at 48 h post-infection with the Plenti6.3PIG7 virus, we found that pretreatment with Z-VAD-FMK
did not result in a protective effect for VP16 (Figure 10A).
In addition, we examined the expression of a necroptosis
marker, p-MLKL (phospho-mixed lineage kinase
domain-like protein), and tested the protective effect of
the necroptosis inhibitor necrosulfonamide (NSA) on
these cells. Although Western blot analysis showed that
p-MLKL exhibited higher levels in the Plent6.3-PIG7
group (Figure 7), our MTT assay revealed that NSA could
not improve the viability of the transfected cells for VP16
(Figure 10A). Interestingly, when we combined Z-VADFMK and NSA, cell viability was significantly increased
(*P < 0.05) (Figure 10A). Next, we analyzed the effect of
these two types of inhibitors using an Annexin V staining
assay. We found that (i) when Z-VAD-FMK was used
alone, apoptosis was significantly inhibited (*P < 0.05)
(Figure 10B), but the percentage of necroptotic cells
was increased (*P < 0.05) (Figure 10B); (ii) when NSA
was used alone, necroptosis was inhibited (*P < 0.05)
(Figure 10B), but the percentage of apoptotic cells was
increased (*P < 0.05) (Figure 10B); (iii) when combined
with Z-VAD-FMK and NSA, cellular apoptosis and
necroptosis were simultaneously inhibited (*P < 0.05)
(Figure 10B).

To test whether the observed chemosensitivitypromoting effect was cathepsin-dependent, we performed
selective inhibition of lysosomal cathepsins with CA074Me (cathepsin B inhibitor), pepstatin A (cathepsin
D inhibitor) and E64D (cathepsins B and L inhibitor). We
also chose the previously used cell lines along with the
following experimental groups: CA-074Me, pepstatin A,
E64D, and DMSO as vehicle control. We then examined
the resulting changes in chemosensitivity (VP16) at 48 h
post-infection with the Plenti6.3-PIG7 virus using both
the MTT assay and Annexin V staining. We found that
incubation with CA-074Me, Pepstatin A, or E64D all
individually and significantly (*P < 0.05) increased
cellular viability (Figure 6A). Annexin V staining
also indicated that these three inhibitors had obvious
antagonistic effects on both apoptosis and necroptosis
(*P < 0.05 for both) (Figure 6B).
It has already been shown that LMP and cathepsin
D release might stimulate autophagy and induce changes
in mitochondrial mass and membrane potential (ΔΨm).
This might be a mechanistic explanation for the observed
apoptotic phenotype. We therefore sought to further
study the changes in selected autophagy markers (LC3I/
II, ATG5 and Beclin-1) and mitochondrial alterations
associated with the release of cathepsins (B, L and
D) in the presence or absence of cathepsin inhibitors.
Western blot analysis showed that the overexpression of
PIG7 increased the expression of LC3I/II, ATG5, and
Beclin-1 (Figure 7). Flow cytometry results showed that
the overexpression of PIG7 had no significant effect on
mitochondrial mass (*P > 0.05) (Figure 8A), but that
it decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential
(*P < 0.05) (Figure 8B). Finally, cathepsin inhibitors
yielded resistance to the decrease in ΔΨm caused by the
overexpression of PIG7 (**P < 0.05) (Figure 8).
Sufficient LMP leads to apoptosis by the release
of cathepsins that allow for crosstalk with mitochondria
as well as the release or stimulation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) [13]. To assess the involvement of ROS
in the chemosensitive-promoting effects, the intracellular
ROS levels were measured at 48 and 72 h after infection
using an intracellular ROS assay kit (Cell Biolabs, San
Diego, CA, USA). DCFH-DA is a cell-permeable, nonfluorescent probe that readily diffuses into cells, where
it is oxidized by ROS to highly fluorescent DCF. As
shown in Figure 5, overexpression of pig7 increased
intracellular oxidative DCF fluorescence intensity, which
is proportional to the amount of intracellular ROS. At
72 h, the DCF fluorescence intensity of K562/ADM,
HL60/ADM, and patient 2 primary cells increased from
approximately 24.7, 31.5, and 23.2 in the Plent6.3 groups
to 36.1, 41.6, and 32.3, respectively. The combination of

group, lysosomal and cytosolic expression of PIG7 were
both significantly higher than expression in the Plent6.3
control group. The combination of VP16 and pig7 further
improved the expression of cytosolic PIG7 (Figure 5).
Confocal microscopy revealed that in the Plent 6.3
control group, the expression of PIG7 was relatively low
and colocalized with LysoTracker Red. At 48 and 72 h

As mentioned above, PIG7 (SIMPLE) localized
in lysosomal membrane in leukemia cells, but we found
an interesting phenomenon that parts of PIG7 were
transferred to the cytosol as pig7 expression increased.
Western blot analysis showed that in the Plent6.3-PIG7

that the expression of PIG7 was gradually enhanced.
Moreover, that a considerable amount of PIG7 protein was
transferred into the cytosol (Figure 11).

leukemia cell lines as well as in acute leukemia patients
who were in complete remission [6].
Many studies have shown that pig7 transcripts can
inhibit tumor cell growth [8, 9]. The mechanism behind
this effect can be attributed to PIG7 and its regulation
of apoptosis. However, the universality of this effect
needs to be considered in accordance with the specific
cell line background. In our previous study, we found
that ectopic expression of PIG7 in K562, HL60, NB4,
and Raji cell lines was unable to affect differentiation
status, proliferation potential, or induction of apoptosis.
Interestingly, when combined with cytotoxic drugs such
as VP16 and daunorubicin, a sensitizing effect could be
observed. In this study, we further studied the relationship
between PIG7 and this sensitization effect. We found that
for different leukemia cells, the sensitizing effect of PIG7
was not only varied, but that it was related to the expression
level of endogenous pig7. In other words, as the expression
of endogenous pig7 was lower, the subsequent sensitizing
effect was significantly higher. This pattern was evident for
not only leukemia cell lines, but also primary cells.

DISCUSSION
Over the last decade, several lines of evidence
have hinted at a possible role for PIG7 abnormalities
in the pathogenesis of some malignancies, including
downregulation in the urinary bladder and breast cancer
carcinomas [16, 17] and mutation in Paget’s disease
[18]. Downregulated gene expression was also detected
in methionine-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells
[17]. PIG7 was silenced by homozygous deletion in
primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and by promoter
hypermethylation in germinal center lymphoma [19].
Our previous study has also revealed a striking decrease
of PIG7 expression in newly diagnosed and refractory/
relapsed acute leukemia patients. Further, these results
were consistent with qRT-PCR performed in eight of ten

(Spi2A and Cystatin C), and necroptosis marker (p-MLKL) product were detected in the Plenti6.3–PIG7 group. Active forms for both
caspase 9 and caspase 3 did not increase.

As previously mentioned, PIG7 localized to the
lysosomal membrane in leukemia cells, so we speculated
that its chemosensitive-promoting effect might be
associated with lysosomal membrane permeabilization
(LMP). Accumulating evidence suggests that partial
LMP with subsequent cytosolic release of lysosomal
proteases may initiate and execute the apoptotic program
in several models of apoptosis [20]. In some settings,
apoptosis induction is dependent on an early release of
cathepsins [21–26]. The mechanism underlying LMP is
still incompletely understood. In this study, we found that

although overexpression of pig7 significantly increased
LMP, induced subsequent release of cathepsins, decreased
the mitochondrial membrane potential, and activated
autophagy, leukemia cells did not undergo apoptosis.
We therefore speculated that there may be some intrinsic
antagonism(s) preventing these apoptotic effectors from
triggering apoptosis in leukemia cells. We then detected
endogenous expression of some serine/cysteine protease
inhibitors (Spi2A and Cystatin C) in the aforementioned

higher levels in the Plent6.3-PIG7 experimental groups
than Plent6.3 control groups (Figure 7). These intrinsic
proteases inhibited lysosomal proteases (including the
cathepsins B, D, L, G, H, K, and V) and protected cells
from apoptosis. When combined with chemotherapy,
LMP was further increased, with a larger amount of

cathepsin released. Once this process reached the limits of
cellular protection, this release became simultaneous with
programmed cell death. Based on these results, we can
infer that although the overexpression of pig7 resulted in
LMP and subsequent cathepsin release, it was not enough
to induce cellular death. The pig7-induced LMP can be

thought of as an early event which pushed the leukemia
cells to a “near apoptotic” state. This was also the same
mechanism for pig7 to promote the chemosensitivity of
leukemia cells.
A growing body of evidence suggests that the
release of lysosomal proteases promotes apoptosis
by acting on mitochondria to induce mitochondrial
dysfunction directly or indirectly [13, 23, 27–33]. Addition
of purified cathepsin B or D to mitochondria in vitro
results in substantial ROS generation [31, 34]. Generation
of ROS following mitochondrial dysfunction can feedback
to the lysosome to maximize lysosomal permeabilization
and, in turn, mitochondrial damage [35]. Cathepsin D
can also trigger Bax activation and translocation to the
mitochondria, where it induces the opening of pores on
the outer mitochondrial membrane [32, 36]. In the present
study, we found that during the induction of LMP (release
of lysosomal proteases) by overexpression of pig7, the
mitochondria membrane potential was decreased and
the concentration of intracellular ROS was increased in
parallel. Then we artificially added cathepsin inhibitors
(E64D, CA-074Me and Pepstatin A) in above cells,
and found these inhibitors were able to protect against
the cytotoxicity of the combination of PIG7 with
chemotherapy. Moreover, antioxidants (α-toco and NAC)
could also play a similar protective effect. These results
confirmed our conclusion from the other side.
For many years, caspases have been taken as
the major class of proteases involved in the execution
of cellular apoptosis [37–40]. There are a number of
publications suggesting that caspases—under certain
circumstances—are involved in the lysosomal release of
apoptogenic factors [34, 41–46]. In our study, we found
that the overexpression of pig7 alone could not activate
caspase 9/Apaf-1 complex and caspase-3. Interestingly,
the combination of pig7 and chemotherapy significantly
increased the expression of cleaved capspase-9 and
cleaved caspase-3, but applying the caspase inhibitor
Z-VAD-FMK did not effectively protect leukemia cells.
From the above results, we speculate that some caspaseindependent cell death pathways such as necroptosis
may be involved in this process, which was induced by
the combination of pig7 and chemotherapy. We detected
expression of necroptosis markers (RIPK1, RIPK3 and
MLKL) and found overexpression of PIG7 can increase
the expression of p-MLKL. However, we found that the
necroptosis inhibitor NSA was unable to increase the
viability of transfected cells with VP16 treatment.
Interestingly, a combination of Z-VAD-FMK and NSA
afforded a protective effect, with an Annexin V staining
assay indicating that cellular apoptosis and necroptosis
were simultaneously inhibited.
In conclusion, our findings implicate that the
sensitizing effect of exogenous pig7 is more effective
in leukemia cells which have lower endogenous pig7
expression. Increasing expression of pig7 can induce
LMP and subsequent release of cathepsins and an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

increase in ROS production. Collectively, these place
leukemia cells on the “verge of apoptosis”, therefore
being more sensitive to cytotoxic drugs. Thus, caspasedependent and caspase-independent pathways, such as
necroptosis, are both involved in programmed cell death
induced by combination of pig7 and chemotherapy. It
is still unclear why PIG7 transfer to the cytosol during
this process. It could be the result of a decreasing
stability of the lysosomal membrane or the direct cause
of LMP. These unanswered questions—along with
whether or not other factors are also involved in the
sensitizing process—remain unknown and ripe for further
investigation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction of lentiviral vectors
PCR was used to amplify the fragment containing
the PIG7 open reading frame from the pMD18T–
PIG7 plasmid. Primer sequences were as follows:
5′-TGTAGGATCCGCCACCATGTCGGTTCCAGGACCT
TAC-3′ and 5′-GTCAGCTAGCCTACAAACGCTTGTA
GGTGCC-3′. The fragment was then subcloned into
pLenti6.3-MCS/V5-DEST (Invitrogen, USA), which is
referred to as “pLenti6.3-PIG7”. The empty vector pLenti6.3MCS/V5-DEST was used in parallel as a control vector.

Cell culture conditions
Two kinds of leukemia cell lines, K562 and HL60,
were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum. The two drug resistant
leukemia cell lines, K562/ADM and HL60/ADM, were
maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1000 ng/ml doxorubicin.
Bone marrow samples were obtained from five AML
patients admitted to the West China Hospital of Sichuan
University. Ten healthy donors were used as controls.
All patients and donors gave their informed consent for
the study. Leukemia diagnoses and classifications were
based on the criteria set forth in 2008 by the World
Health Organization. Bone marrow mononuclear cells
were cultured in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium
supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum for use in
subsequent experiments.

Lentivirus production and transduction
Lentiviral vector constructs were co-transfected
into 293T cells with a packaging plasmid mix (Invitrogen,
USA) using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent
(Invitrogen, USA). Infectious lentiviruses were collected at
both 48 h and 72 h after transfection and were concentrated
to 100-fold using ultracentrifugation. Leukemia cells
were then transduced with the prepared lentivirus. After
optimizing the conditions of lentiviral infection, our
4855

infection efficiency was found to be greater than 65%
in each group. Resulting transgene expression was then
detected by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot.

a series of drug concentrations and corresponding
OD546 nm values measured by the MTT assay. The IC50
represented the drug concentrations required to achieve a
50% decrease in OD546 nm values.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR

Apoptosis assessment by Annexin V staining

Before and after lentiviral transfection, leukemia
cells were collected and quantitative real-time RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR) was performed according to our previous
study [6]. The relative expression values were normalized
to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase for cell
lines or the median PIG7 expression of ten healthy donors
for primary leukemia cells.

Leukemia cells were infected with lentivirus, and
then parts of them were incubated with doxorubicin
(ADM) or etoposide (VP16) of various concentrations
respectively. The cells were collected at different time
and analyzed for apoptosis by Annexin V-PE/7-AAD kit
(BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. All the samples were analyzed
by FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson
Immunocytometry Systems; San Jose, CA, USA).

Lysosomal isolation and enrichment
Leukemia cells were collected and the lysosomes
were isolated using a Lysosome Enrichment Kit (Thermo
Scientific, UT, USA) both before and after lentiviral
transfection. Cells included those infected with the
lentivirus alone or in combination with chemotherapy
treatment. The isolated lysosomes and the non-lysosomecontaining lysate were collected for subsequent Western
blot analysis.

LMP assessment
AO staining analysis using flow cytometry: Cells
were incubated with acridine orange (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.
St. Louis, MO, USA) (1 μmol/L) for 30 minutes at 37°C.
Cells were washed and their mean fluorescence intensity
was quantified using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA).
AO staining analysis by fluorescence microscopy:
Cells were incubated with acridine orange (1 μmol/L) for
30 minutes at 37°C. Cells were smeared with cytospin
onto slides and immediately observed and imaged using
an Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope.

Western blot analysis
The expression of PIG7, Pro-Cathepsin B, D, L,
Cathepsin B, D, L, Caspase 3, 9, Cleaved Caspase 3, 9,
LC3 I/II, ATG5, Beclin-1, Spi2A and Cystatin C were
confirmed by Western blot both before and after leukemia
cells were transfected with pLenti6.3-PIG7, or pLenti6.3
control vector (either alone or in combination with
chemotherapy treatment). The immunoreactive proteins
were visualized using the SuperSignal chemiluminescent
detection system (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) in a similar
exposure time. Antibodies against Caspase-3, Caspase-9,
LC3B, ATG5, Beclin-1, Cystatin C and MLKL were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA, USA). Antibodies against Cathepsin B, Cathepsin D,
Cathepsin L and β-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Dallas, Texas, USA). Antibody against
PIG7 was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego,
CA, USA). Antibody against Spi2A was purchased from
Abcam (Cambridge, UK).

Detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
Cells were incubated with DCFH-DA (SigmaAldrich Corp. St. Louis, MO, USA) (5 µmol/L) for
40 minutes at 37°C. Cells were washed and fluorescence
intensity (Em 525 nm) was quantified with a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer to determine the ROS levels.

Detection of mitochondria mass and
mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨm)
Cells were incubated with MitoTracker Green FM
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) (100 µmol/L) and
MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Invitrogen, Grand Island,
NY, USA) (100 µmol/L) respectively for 30 minutes at
37°C. Cells were washed and fluorescence intensity (Em
516 nm and Em 599 nm, respectively) was quantified
with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer to determine the
mitochondria mass and ΔΨm.

MTT colorimetric assay
An MTT colorimetric assay was utilized to
determine leukemia cells viability and sensitivity to
chemotherapy treatment. Experiments were performed in
triplicate and the resulting average used for all statistical
analyses. The protocol used has been published previously
by Morabito et al. [47]. The optical density (OD) of the
cells was measured at 546 nm using a microplate reader
(SLT-Lab, Salzburg, Austria). IC50 values were calculated
using a linear regression that was determined between

values at 48 h were calculated by line fitting normalized
viability versus concentration with non-linear regression
and statistical significance determined using one-way
ANOVA. Differences in viability, caspase-3 activity,
and apoptosis were analyzed using two-way ANOVA
to identify differences. Any significant differences were
confirmed with paired two-tailed t-tests. The significance
of differences between two groups was determined using
a paired t-test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered
as statistically significant for all tests.
