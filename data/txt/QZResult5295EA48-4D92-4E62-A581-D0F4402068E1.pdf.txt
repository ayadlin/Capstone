ABSTRACT
We report data from the final analysis of the Chinese subset of the GIDEON
(the Global Investigation of therapeutic DEcisions in hepatocellular carcinoma and
Of its treatment with sorafeNib) study, which evaluated the safety and efficacy
of sorafenib in Child-Pugh A, B and C patients with unresectable hepatocellular
carcinoma (uHCC) in real-life clinical practice. Patient demographics, disease
characteristics and treatment history were recorded at enrollment; dose, adverse
events (AEs) and efficacy were recorded at follow-up. Of the 338 evaluable patients,
98.5% started on 800 mg/day sorafenib, regardless of their Child-Pugh status.
The median treatment duration (21.1 vs. 18.8 weeks) and median overall survival
(322 vs 240 days) were longer in patients with Child-Pugh A compared with the
Child-Pugh B, progression-free survival were 183 vs. 208 days, respectively). AEs

(all grades) were comparable in the Child-Pugh B vs A group (56.3% vs. 50.4%,
respectively), moreover, the Child-Pugh B group also had comparable rates of drugrelated AEs (35.4% vs. 27.2%, respectively) and serious AEs (25.0% vs. 23.0%,
respectively) compared with the Child-Pugh A group. The overall dosing strategy was
consistent in Chinese patients across Child-Pugh subgroups. Tolerability and safety
data suggest that Child-Pugh B patients might be safely treated with sorafenib.
The findings from our study showed that safety profile of sorafenib in terms of rate
and type of AEs is similar to the global international GIDEON study as well as other
pivotal studies.

in 2008 [18]. Two placebo-controlled, Phase III studies
(SHARP and Asia-Pacific) acted as milestones in the
treatment of patients with uHCC (Child-Pugh A),
revealing that sorafenib caused significant improvements
in overall survival (OS) [5, 19]. Yao et al, in an analysis
concluded that discontinuation of sorafenib treatment for
a long period can lead to uHCC disease progression, and,
appropriate management of sorafenib-related AEs could
result in better clinical outcomes in patients with HCC
[20].
GIDEON (the Global Investigation of therapeutic
DEcisions in hepatocellular carcinoma and Of its
treatment with sorafeNib) is a global, international,
prospective, non-interventional study undertaken to
fulfill post-approval commitments to licensing agencies
for compiling a large, more comprehensive, and robust
database of HCC treatment patterns and outcomes among
patients with advanced disease [21]. The GIDEON trial
evaluated the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in uHCC
patients under real-life clinical practice conditions,
including patients with Child-Pugh B liver function as
well, who were usually excluded from randomized clinical
trials[21]. Being one of the largest studies undertaken in
patients with uHCC, GIDEON allows the conduct of
multiple predefined sub-analyses, focusing on potentially
predictive or prognostic factors, including the Child-Pugh
score, staging systems, etiology, and prior or concomitant
TACE. Results from these sub-analyses would be useful
to analyze differences that would influence prognosis
and management of HCC, and, thus, will aid physicians
in effectively treating HCC to improve patient outcomes
[22–25]. Here we report the final analysis of safety and
efficacy of sorafenib treatment in the Chinese subset of
GIDEON study.

INTRODUCTION
Primary liver cancer (PLC) represents the
sixth most common malignancy worldwide and is
the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths [1].
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common
type of PLC. Globally, ~75% of the deaths occurring due
to HCC worldwide is expected to rise, due partly to the
increasing incidence of hepatitis C [2]. Owing to its large
population China has a very high prevalence of PLCs,
contributing to more than 50% of all PLCs worldwide,
with estimated cases of 293,000 in males and 101,000 in
females, as reported in GLOBOCAN 2012 [3, 4]. Data
from various studies have reflected that China has the
highest prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers in
the world and an increasing trend in the rate of hepatitis
C virus (HCV) infection. All these factors contribute to
a heavy disease burden in China. Although healthcare
advancements have been noted in the management of
HCC, there has not been any considerable reduction in
the mortality over the past few decades. The Ministry
of Health of China has also taken several measures to
control the disease, but it still remains a health issue of
major concern [4–8].
Most HCC patients present unresectable disease
(uHCC), wherein surgery is contraindicated. Moreover,
survival benefits obtained from medical interventions
are controversial. Nonsurgical loco-regional treatment
options, such as image-guided ablation and transcatheter
arterial chemoembolization (TACE) or use of 90Y
microspheres (TheraSphere), have limited applicability
and may lead to high rates of recurrence [9,10]. Despite
the magnitude of the burden of uHCC patients with
uHCC still have poor prognosis and limited treatment
options. Therefore, further studies are warranted in the
field of management of uHCC in terms of treatment
morbidity, mortality, and survival.
Sorafenib is an orally bioavailable multitargeted
tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potential antiangiogenic
and antiproliferative properties that acts by blocking a
number of protein kinases[11, 12]. Based on the promising
results observed in several clinical trials, sorafenib has
been suggested as a first-line therapy in patients with
uHCC patients for several years [13–17], and, was
approved by the China Food and Drug Administration

RESULTS
Patient disposition and baseline characteristics
by Child-Pugh status
During January 2009 and April 2012, a total of 3371
patients from 39 countries of 5 regions were included in
the GIDEON study (NCT00812175). The Chinese subset
included a total of 345 patients, of which, 338 patients
(92.3% were male) were included in the ITT population.
6640

Oncotarget

The safety (SAF) population included 331 patients. At
the start of sorafenib therapy, 74.0% of patients (median
age: 50 years) had Child-Pugh A status, 15.1% of patients
(median age: 52 years) had Child-Pugh B status, and
0.6% of patients (median age: 58 years) had Child-Pugh
C status. Majority of the patients belonged to Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG
PS) of 0 or 1 (Child-Pugh A: 90%; Child-Pugh B: 66.7%;
Child-Pugh C: 50%). Tumor node metastasis (TNM)
stage IV was more prominent in Child-Pugh A (41.2%)
patients, whereas most of the Child-Pugh B and C patients
reported TNM stage III (51% vs. 50%, respectively).
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C was
prominently noted in the majority of the patients (63.2%
of patients with Child-Pugh A and 68.6% with ChildPugh B). Baseline characteristics by Child-Pugh status are
summarized in Table 1 .

time to onset of AEs greater than grade 1 in the Child-Pugh
A group was comparable to that in the Child-Pugh B group,
with the majority of AEs occurring within the first 30 days
of treatment in both groups (Figure 2). Overall, comparable
rates of treatment-emergent AEs were reported in ChildPugh B and Child-Pugh A patients. Discontinuation of
treatment due to AEs was slightly more common in ChildPugh B than in Child-Pugh A patients (10.4% vs 8.9%).
Also, the number of treatment-emergent deaths occurring
up to 30 days after the last sorafenib dose was comparable
in Child-Pugh B patients and Child-Pugh A patients.

Efficacy outcomes
Median OS was 322 days in the Chinese subset
(Figure 3). The OS was longer in Child-Pugh A patients
than in Child-Pugh B patients (Table 4, Figure 4). ChildPugh B patients showed a similar progression-free
survival (PFS) to that of Child-Pugh A patients. Median
time to progression (TTP) could not be compared between
subgroups due to the high censoring rate in the Child-Pugh
B and C groups.

Sorafenib dosing and duration
Overall, the majority of patients received the
recommended initial dose of 800 mg (98.5%); the median
daily dose was 800 mg. These were consistent across all
Child-Pugh subgroups. The duration of treatment was
slightly longer in Child-Pugh A (21.1 weeks) patients than
in Child-Pugh B patients (18.8 weeks) (Table 2).
The majority of patients in the Child-Pugh B group
received sorafenib for <8 weeks. However, a considerable
percentage of patients also received sorafenib for >24
weeks, though the number was fewer than that in the
Child-Pugh A group. The percentages of patients treated
for >28 weeks in the Child-Pugh A and B groups were
40.8% and 31.4%, respectively (Figure 1).

DISCUSSION
Previously conducted large clinical trials enrolled
Child-Pugh class A patients, and thus, the viability of sorafenib
treatment in patients with uHCC and poor liver function was
largely unknown[5,19]. GIDEON is of considerable clinical
interest and relevance, as the study provides an opportunity
to assess a wider patient population as compared with
randomized clinical trials. Observations from this study will
aid physicians in effectively treating HCC and improving
patient outcomes. To our knowledge, GIDEON is amongst
the largest study undertaken in patients with HCC involving
3371 patients from 39 countries of 5 regions [21].
The results of the Chinese subset of GIDEON reveal
that patient demographics in China are largely in line with the
previous global GIDEON report in terms of gender, staging,
Child-Pugh status, and performance status [25]. However,
in our study, patients appeared to be younger, and most of
them belonged to BCLC Stage C (62.1%), in whom sorafenib
could be considered an appropriate treatment option [26].
Several studies have indicated that sorafenib is
beneficial in Child-Pugh B patients, with an acceptable
safety profile [25, 27–32]. In our study, Child-Pugh status
did not appear to influence the approach to sorafenib dosing.
A considerable percentage of Chinese patients in the ChildPugh B group received sorafenib for >28 weeks. In contrast
to the global report, almost all Chinese patients received the
recommended initial daily dose of sorafenib (800 mg/day),
suggesting that sorafenib was well tolerated in Chinese
patients. Notably, the median treatment duration was 63.3
weeks in 2 Chinese Child-Pugh C patients, which might
imply that patients with liver dysfunction could still receive
sorafenib therapy. However, the extremely small sample

Safety assessment
Based on the SAF dataset, a comparison of the
incidence of AEs and serious AEs in the Child-Pugh A
and B subgroups is presented in Table 3A. No AEs were
observed in the Child-Pugh C group. AEs (all grades) were
comparable in the Child-Pugh B group compared with
the Child-Pugh A group (56.3% vs. 50.4%, respectively).
Similarly, Child-Pugh B group also had comparable rates
of drug-related AEs (35.4% vs. 27.2%, respectively) and
serious AEs (25.0% vs. 23.0%, respectively) as compared
with the Child-Pugh A group. The most common drugrelated AEs overall were diarrhea, hand-foot skin reaction
(HFSR), and rash/desquamation. No unexpected AEs were
observed in patients with liver dysfunction (Table 3B). The
incidence of drug-related HFSR was higher in the ChildPugh A group than in the Child-Pugh B group (20.7% vs
14.6%, respectively), although incidence of diarrhea was
higher in the Child-Pugh B group than in the Child-Pugh
A group (14.6% vs 10.2%). The rates of drug-related AEs,
calculated as the number of events per patient-year, in the
Child-Pugh A and B groups are presented in Table 3C. The

With the exception that fatigue was not a common AE
in Chinese patients, the safety profile was largely consistent
with that in the global report, with diarrhea, HFSR, and
rash/desquamation being the most commonly reported
drug-related AEs. Although the Child-Pugh B group had
most of the drug-related AEs, the Child-Pugh A group had
more HFSR cases. Comparable rates of treatment-emergent
AEs were reported among Child-Pugh B and Child-Pugh
A patients. Discontinuation of treatment due to AEs was

than grade 1 occurred within the first 30 days of treatment in
both Child-Pugh A and B groups. Overall, most commonly
reported drug-related AEs across Child-Pugh subgroups
were comparable in both type and incidence.
Consistent with previous reports, OS was longer in
Child-Pugh A patients compared with Child-Pugh B or
C patients; suggesting that Child-Pugh status is a strong
prognostic indicator of OS in uHCC patients, regardless of
treatment with sorafenib. PFS was similar between ChildPugh A and B patients. As shown in Table 4 , many patients

analyses) groups may have been lost to follow-up. These
findings are in line with the previously conducted SHARP and
Asia-Pacific study. The SHARP trial enrolled 602 patients and
showed prolonged median OS (10.7 vs. 7.9 months; P<.001)
and prolonged time to radiological disease progression (5.5
vs. 2.8 months; P<.001) for sorafenib compared with placebo
[19]. Similarly, the Asia-Pacific study demonstrated that
sorafenib had a substantially longer median OS (6.4 vs 4.2
months) and median TTP (2.8 vs 1.4 months) over placebo [5].
Our study has certain limitations. First, being an
observational study, it is subjected to known and unknown
confounders and biases. Second, lack of randomization and
a placebo or a comparative group may change the study
outcomes. Third, statistical limitation of our data must be
considered before drawing any definitive conclusion. Owing
to all the above factors, it becomes mandatory that the
implications of this observational study must be interpreted
with caution. Further prospective trials are much needed to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in Child-Pugh
class subgroups, particularly in those patients with less
compromised liver function. Nevertheless, the primary strength
of our analysis to observe both practice patterns and the safety
of an intervention in real-life practice should not be ignored.
The GIDEON study has now been completed,
fulfilling a licensing commitment to assess the safety of
sorafenib in clinical practice. Our study results suggest
that sorafenib at 800 mg/day appears to be safe and better
tolerated in Chinese clinical setting. Child-Pugh status was
found to be a strong prognostic indicator of OS in uHCC
patients. Tolerability and safety data suggest that ChildPugh B patients might be safely treated with sorafenib.
The findings from our study showed that safety profile
of sorafenib in terms of rate and type of AEs is similar to
GIDEON study, in Chinese uHCC patients with Child-Pugh
B, as well other pivotal GIDEON subset studies [21, 33, 34].

response rate, and rate of stable disease) and duration of
therapy; regional and global methods of patient evaluation,
diagnosis, and follow-up; evaluation of comorbidities and
their influence on treatment and outcome; and evaluation
of practice patterns of the physicians involved in the care
of these patients. Computed tomography (CT) and other
radiographic methods were used by the physicians for
assessing the tumor at baseline, at follow-up visits, or at a
frequency determined by the treating physician.

Patient population
The inclusion criteria were similar to that of the
principal GIDEON trial [21]. Patients were eligible for
participating in GIDEON if they were ≥18 years of age; were
diagnosed histologically, cytologically, or radiographically
with uHCC; had a life expectancy of >8 weeks; had not
undertaken previous sorafenib treatment; were candidates
for systemic therapy; and in whom the decision to be treated
with sorafenib had been made by their physician (radiographic
diagnosis required the typical observations of HCC by a
radiographic method, i.e., multidimensional dynamic CT,
CT hepatic arteriography/CT arterial portography, or MRI).
Moreover, the patients’ physicians must be willing to duly
complete and submit all case report forms and must be
ready to submit to a site audit with verification of the source
documents along with all the other related records/testimonials
and validation of the reported data. Exclusion criteria were
based on the local product information for sorafenib.

Informed consent

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Signed patient consent form and eligibility criteria
form were completed for all patients who were included
in the study and were approved by local Ethics Review
Board. All patients’ data were kept anonymous. All the
participants received a written explanation of the study and
provided written informed consent before participating.

Study design

Ethical considerations

GIDEON was the largest, international, prospective,
open-label, non-interventional study that presented data from
a global perspective. Design and rationale of the GIDEON
study have already been published by Lencioni et al [21].
As a non-interventional study, assignment to a particular
therapeutic strategy was not mandated by the study protocol
but imitated the current practice of participating physicians.
The decision to include a patient in the study was separate
from the treatment decision. The final analysis was conducted
upon completion of the 12-month follow-up assessment [21].

This study followed the ethical principles approved
by the local institutional review board, ethics committees,
and health authorities according to Good Clinical Practice
and local laws and regulations in China, as well as
established recommendations and regulations pertaining
to non-interventional and post-authorization safety studies
[26]. All procedures followed were in accordance with the
ethical standards of the responsible committee on human
experimentation (institutional and national) and with the
Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.

and ECOG PS, were summarized using the safety
population. All data were collected using case report
forms at study entry and at the initiation of sorafenib
treatment, and then at intervals normally decided by the
prescribing physician (usually ≥6 weeks or ≥12 weeks), or
until patient’s death, withdrawal, or loss to follow-up, or
if significant changes in a patient’s disease were observed
[17]. Analyses of the final data were conducted to evaluate
dosing patterns, AEs, and outcomes [21].

The GIDEON study is funded by Bayer HealthCare
Pharmaceuticals and Onyx Pharmaceuticals.

Statistical analyses
Patients who received at least one dose of sorafenib
and underwent at least one follow-up assessment were
evaluable for safety and efficacy. All AEs were graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.
Descriptive statistics, such as frequency, proportion, mean,
median, standard deviation, 95% confidence intervals,
and quartiles, were calculated for all baseline, safety, and
efficacy data. Kaplan–Meier estimates were calculated for
the OS, PFS, and TTP efficacy end points.
The recruitment number was based on an overall
sample of 3000 patients, a number considered sufficient
for comprehensive evaluation of safety for the overall
population, as well as planned subgroup analyses [13]. No
P-values are presented as all data are summarized using
descriptive statistics.
