ABSTRACT
Recombinant capsid protein VP1 (rVP1) of foot-and-mouth disease virus binds
to integrins to modulate Akt/GSK3-β signaling and suppress migration/invasion
and metastasis of cancer cells, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear.
Here, we showed that the rVP1-mediated inhibition of Akt/GSK3-β signaling and
cell migration/invasion was accompanied by downregulation in phosphatidylinositol
(3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and IKK/NF-κB signaling as
well as suppression of COX-2/PGE2 and MIG-7. Addition of PIP3 or overexpression
of ILK reversed the rVP1-induced inhibition of IKK/NF-κB signaling, COX-2 and MIG7. The rVP1-mediated downregulation of COX-2/PGE2 and MIG-7 led to not only
attenuation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, MMP2 activity and invasion of lung
cancer cells in vitro but also decreased tumor growth and metastasis of lung cancer
in xenograft mice. Moreover, downregulation of COX-2/PGE2 and MIG-7 significantly
prolonged the overall and disease-free survival of lung cancer-bearing mice. These
results suggest that rVP1 inhibits cancer invasion/metastasis, partly if not mainly,
via downregulating integrin/PI3K/Akt, ILK and IKK/NF-κB signaling to suppress
expression of COX-2/PGE2 and MIG-7.

INTRODUCTION

3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) and extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling to induce
tumor angiogenesis, cancer motility and invasiveness [811]. Recently COX-2/PGE2 has also been found to induce
migration inducing gene-7 (MIG-7) protein that sustains
the activation of PI3K/Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3 β
(GSK-3β) signaling via decreasing the activity of protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to increase lung cancer invasion/
metastasis [12].
Recombinant DNA-derived VP1 (rVP1) of foot-andmouth disease virus (FMDV) has previously been found to
induce apoptosis of human cancer cell lines MCF-7, PC-3
and 22Rv1 via modulation of the integrin/Akt signaling
pathway [13]. Recently, rVP1 has also been shown to
suppress progression of hepatocellular carcinoma [14]
and invasion of SKOV3 ovarian adenocarcinoma cells
as well as SiHa and Caski cervical carcinoma cells [15,

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related
death worldwide [1, 2]. Metastasis is the primary cause
of lung cancer treatment failure and mortality [1, 3].
Understanding the cellular mediators that contribute
to the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer and the
development of novel therapeutic agents targeting these
mediators are urgently needed.
One of the potential mediators of metastasis is
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the inducible isoform of
COX. COX-2 is frequently found in early and advanced
lung cancer tissues and is associated with poor prognosis
[4-7]. Elevation of tumor COX-2 increases the level of
its metabolite prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) that is a ligand
of G protein-coupled receptors, such as EP1, EP2, EP3,
and EP4. COX-2/PGE2 stimulates phosphatidylinositol

16]. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the
inhibition of cancer invasion/metastasis by rVP1 remain
largely unexamined.
In this study, we explored whether rVP1 has any
effect on COX-2/PGE2 and MIG-7. Our results showed
that rVP1 suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), migration/invasion and metastasis of human
lung cancer cells. Its mechanism of action involved
modulation of PIP3 and ILK in the lipid rafts as well as
suppression of IKK/NF-κB, COX-2/PGE2 and MIG-7.
The role of rVP1-mediated decrease of COX-2/PGE2 and
MIG-7 in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis of lung
adenocarcinoma was further substantiated by analyzing
COX-2/PGE2 and MIG-7 in the lung cancer xenograft
mice with or without rVP1 treatment.

rVP1 suppresses EMT, MMP-2 and migration/
invasion of human lung cancer cells
We previously showed that rVP1 suppresses growth
and migration/invasion of ovarian and cervical cancer
[15, 16]. To investigate whether rVP1 inhibits lung cancer
cells in a similar manner, three human lung cancer cell
lines, A549, H1299 and CL1-5 were treated with rVP1.
Our results showed that rVP1 inhibited the cell viability
of A549, H1299 and CL1-5 in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 1A) with IC50 values of 0.93, 0.88 and 0.68
μM, respectively. Interestingly, even at concentrations (0.2
μM - 0.4 μM) that caused only minimal cell death (Figure

Figure 1: rVP1 suppresses the migration/invasion of lung cancer cells in vitro. Lung cancer cells (A549, H1299 and CL1-5;

2 × 105/mL) were treated with 0.4 µM rVP1 in 0.5% FBS medium for 24 h, unless specified otherwise. (A) Lung cancer cells were treated
with serial concentrations of rVP1 (0–2 µM) as indicated. Cell proliferation was measured by WST-1 assay in vitro. Data represent means

control. Blots are representative of three independent experiments. (D) The MMP-2 and MMP-9 enzyme activity in the cell-cultured

1A), rVP1 dramatically suppressed migration and invasion
of A549, H1299 and CL1-5 cells (Figure 1B).
Since the downregulation of epithelial cell marker
E-cadherin and a concomitant increase in the expression
of the mesenchymal cell marker vimentin correlate
with enhancement in EMT and migration/invasion of
cancer cells [17], we determined the effect of rVP1 on
the expression level of E-cadherin and vimentin in lung
cancer cells. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that
treatment with rVP1 (0.4 µM) for 24 h attenuated EMT
by upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating vimentin

expression levels in A549, H1299 and CL1-5 lung cancer
cell lines (Figure 1C).
As MMP activity is positively associated with
enhanced cellular invasion [18], we next evaluated the
effect of rVP1 on MMP activity of lung cancer cells.
Gelatin zymographic analysis showed that the MMP-2
activity in A549, H1299 and CL1-5 cells was reduced
by rVP1 treatment (Figure 1D). These results thus
demonstrated that rVP1 decreases EMT and MMP-2
activity to suppress the migration and invasion of lung
cancer cells.

rVP1 downregulates integrin β1/Akt, COX-2/
PGE2 and MIG-7 to suppress lung cancer cell
migration/invasion

through integrin β1 [15]. Since inhibition of integrin β1
signaling has been reported to attenuate COX-2 and MIG7 levels [19, 20], we examined whether rVP1 suppresses
expression of COX-2 and MIG-7 in human lung cancer
cells through the integrin β1/Akt pathway. Our results
showed that phospho-AktS473, COX-2, PGE2 and MIG7 were decreased in lung cancer cells treated with rVP1

PIP3 and ILK play essential roles in rVP1mediated downregulation of IKK/NF-κB signaling
and COX-2

(0.4 µM) for 24 h (Figure 2A). The rVP-1-mediated
reduction of AktS473 phosphorylation as well as COX-2,
PGE2 and MIG-7 expression was reversed by anti-integrin
β1 antibodies, but not by the control immunoglobulin G
(IgG) (Figure 2A). Constitutive phosphorylation of Akt
at serine 473 (AktS473) by transfecting lung cancer cells
with dominant active Akt plasmid (pAkt-DA) increased
the EMT, MMP2 activity and invasion ability of cancer
cells and increased expression of COX-2 and MIG-7
(Figure 2B and 2C). These effects of constitutively active
Akt were reversed by knockdown of COX-2 or MIG-7
with transfection of COX-2 siRNA (siCOX-2) or MIG7 siRNA (siMIG-7) (Figure 2B and 2C). As anticipated,
the constitutively active-Akt-mediated COX-2 and MIG-7
expression was not attenuated by rVP1 (0.4 µM) (Figure
2D). These results suggest that rVP1 inhibits EMT,
MMP2 activity and the invasion of lung cancer cells via
downregulating phosphorylated Akt as well as suppression
of COX-2 and MIG-7 expression.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) phosphorylates
phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-biphosphate (PIP2) to generate
phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) that can
bind to the pleckstrin-homology domains of integrinlinked kinase (ILK) and Akt to increase the attachment
of ILK and Akt to lipid rafts, leading to the activation
of Akt signaling pathways [21-23]. To elucidate the
mechanism by which rVP1 acts on the integrin β1/Akt
signaling of lung cancer cells, we examined the effects
of rVP1 on integrin downstream targets, PI3K, PIP3,
ILK and Akt. Our results showed that rVP1 increased
phosphorylation of phosphatase PTEN accompanied by
a decrease in phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase
(FAK), a molecule upstream of PI3K, as well as PI3Kp85Y458 and AktS473 (Figure 3A). Further studies showed
that rVP1 decreased PIP3 and prevented accumulation of

3B). Addition of PIP3 reversed the inhibitory effect of
rVP1 on the level of ILK, Akt and phospho-AktS473 in the
lipid rafts (Figure 3B). These results demonstrated that
rVP1 decreases phosphorylation of FAK, PI3K and PIP3
leading to a decline in ILK and phospho-AktS473 in the raft
domains.

To further understand how rVP1 could reduce
expression of COX-2, we next examined whether ILK or
the IKK/NF-κB pathway plays any role in the inhibitory
effect of rVP1 on COX-2 expression in lung cancer cells.
We found that overexpression of ILK by transfection of

cells increased phosphorylation of AktS473, IKKα/βS176/180

in vivo

and NF-κB p65S536 as well as degradation of IκB, which
were positively correlated with elevation of COX-2 level
(Figure 3C and 3D). Transduction of inactive Akt by
transfection of Akt-DN plasmid (pAkt-DN) blocked the
ILK-mediated induction of IKKα/β-IκB-NF-κB signaling
and expression of COX-2 (Figure 3C). Even though
knockdown of NF-κB p65 by transfection of NF-κB p65
siRNA (+siNFκBp65) did not affect phosphorylation
of AktS473, it also suppressed the ILK-induced COX-2
expression (Figure 3D). Overexpression of ILK or NFκB p65 by transfection with pILK or pNFκBp65 blocked
the inhibition of COX-2 expression by rVP1 (Figure 3E).
Taken together, these results indicate that rVP1 inhibits
integrin/FAK/PI3K to decrease the level of PIP3 which in
turn modulates ILK level in the lipid rafts to regulate IKK/
NF-κB pathway signaling and COX-2 expression.

To examine whether rVP1 inhibits lung cancer
metastasis via downregulating COX-2 and MIG-7 in
vivo, we generated CL1-5GL cells stably expressing green
fluorescent protein and luciferase (GL). Some CL15GL cells were pretreated for 24 h with rVP1 at such a
low concentration (0.3 µM) that inhibited cell invasion
(Supplementary Figure 2A) but not cell proliferation
(Supplementary Figure 2B). The CL1-5GL cells with
or without rVP1 pretreatment, respectively, were then
implanted into two groups of SCID mice via tail-vein
injection. After implantation, a significant reduction of
tumor nodules in the lung was observed in mice injected
with rVP1-pretreated-CL1-5GL cells (Figure 5A and 5B) as
compared to those injected with CL1-5GL cells that were
not pretreated with rVP1. Analysis of lung tissue lysates
showed that mice implanted with rVP1-pretreated CL15GL had lower EMT, phospho-AktS473, phospho-NF-κBS536,
COX-2 and MIG-7 than those implanted with CL1-5GL
without rVP1 pretreatment (Figure 5C). Histopathologic
examination showed that there was more downregulation
of Ki67 and upregulation of E-cadherin in in the rVP1pretreated group than in the control group (Figure 5D).
Moreover, all the mice implanted with CL1-5GL without
rVP1 pretreatment died on or before day 50 postinoculation; whereas all the mice implanted with rVP1pretreated-CL1-5GL cells were disease free on day 250.
To further investigate the in vivo effect of rVP1,
instead of pretreating CL1-5GL cells with rVP1, we
implanted the cancer cells into SCID mice and one week
later start administering rVP1 (5 or 15 mg/kg body weight)
intravenously via the tail vein three times per week for 4
weeks. Although not as effective as pretreatment, rVP1
still significantly reduced tumor growth in the lungs of
CL1-5GL-bearing mice as compared to those treated with
control vehicle (Figure 6A and 6B). Analysis of tumor
lysates obtained from the vehicle- and rVP1-treated mice
showed that the levels of EMT, phospho-AktS473, phosphoNF-κBS536, COX-2 and MIG-7 in tumors from the rVP1treated mice were lower than those in tumors from the
vehicle-treated mice (Figure 6C). Histological analysis
of lungs revealed that there was less dissemination of
tumor cells in lung tissue sections from rVP1-treated
mice whereas many more cancer cells were found in
vehicle-treated mice (Figure 6D) as indicated by Ki67
level. Comparison of the survival curve of rVP1-treated
mice with that of vehicle-treated mice showed that rVP1
treatment significantly prolonged the survival of tumorbearing mice (Figure 6E). Taken together, these results
suggest that rVP1-mediated downregulation of COX-2
and MIG-7 suppressed EMT and the metastatic capability
of human lung cancer cells, and therefore prolonged the

rVP-1 suppresses COX-2 and MIG-7 to mitigate
EMT and migration/invasion of lung cancer cells
We recently showed that COX-2/PGE2 activates
EP4 to enhance Akt and GSK-3β phosphorylation
and β-catenin/LEF/TCF signaling leading to MIG-7
upregulation [12]. To investigate whether rVP1-mediated
decrease of COX-2/PGE2 (and/or MIG-7) is functionally
associated with rVP1/integrin β1/Akt-mediated reduction
in EMT, MMP2 and invasion of lung cancer cells, we
transfected lung cancer cell lines (H1299 and CL1-5)
with COX-2 or MIG-7 plasmids (pCOX2 or pMIG7) to
overexpress COX-2 or MIG-7 protein. We found that
transfection with pCOX2 increased COX-2 together with
MIG-7 protein, EMT, MMP-2 activity and invasion of
lung cancer cells (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure
1). PGE2 treatment also increased MIG-7 protein,
EMT, MMP-2 activity and invasion of lung cancer cells
(Supplementary Figure 1). MIG-7 knockdown (+siMIG7)
attenuated the effects of COX-2 overexpression and
PGE2 treatment on MIG-7, EMT, MMP-2 and the
invasion of the cells, but did not affect expression level
of COX-2 (Supplementary Figure 1). The rVP-1-mediated
suppression of EMT as shown by induction of E-cadherin
expression and reduction of vimentin could be reversed in
cancer cells by transduction of pCOX-2 or pMIG-7 (Figure
4A and 4B). In addition, overexpression of COX-2 and
MIG-7 reversed the inhibition of MMP2 enzyme activity
and invasion ability of H1299 and CL1-5 cells by rVP1
(Figure 4A and 4B). Collectively, these results suggest that
rVP1 modulates integrin β1/Akt signaling to downregulate
COX-2/PGE2 that then attenuates MIG-7 protein level
resulting in inhibition of the EMT, MMP-2 activity and
invasion of lung cancer cells.

survival of lung cancer xenograft mice.

whereas overexpression of MIG-7 reversed the inhibitory
effects of rVP1 on EMT and invasion (Figure 4A and
4B) it is likely that MIG-7 and phosphorylated prohibitin
might have a synergistic or additive effect on E-cadherin,
EMT and cell migration/invasion. Whether there is a
functional relationship between phospho-PHBT258 and
MIG-7 and whether rVP1 attenuates either one to affect
the other or both via different pathways are currently
under investigation.
In summary, our study demonstrates that rVP1
downregulates integrin/FAK/PI3K and PIP3 as well as
ILK and phospho-Akt in the raft domains to attenuate
IKK/NF-κB signaling and reduce COX-2 and MIG-7
level leading to suppression of EMT and the invasion/
metastasis of lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. These
results suggest that agents such as rVP1 that selectively
modulate COX-2/PGE2 and MIG-7 level may have great
potential for development as novel therapeutic agents for
metastatic cancer.

DISCUSSION
A variety of scenarios, notably smoking and
inflammation induce high levels of COX-2/PGE2 [24].
Although we previously reported that binding of rVP1
to integrins induces cancer apoptosis [13] and decreases
cancer invasion/metastasis [16], the relationship between
rVP-mediated effects and COX-2/PGE2 was unclear. The
results of this study demonstrate for the first time that
rVP1 is able to suppress COX-2/PGE2-mediated signaling
transduction to attenuate cancer invasiveness (Figures 1,
2 and 3). In view of these findings, it might be worthwhile
exploring whether the COX-2/PGE2-related adverse
effects of smoking and inflammation can be modulated
by rVP1.
rVP1 inhibits cancer cell migration/invasion by
downregulating integrin/FAK/Akt/GSK-3β signaling
and MMP-2 activity [16]. However, it was not clear how
interaction of rVP1 with integrin could attenuate Akt/
GSK-3β signaling. Here we showed that rVP1 inhibited
lung cancer invasion by decreasing FAK/PI3K/PIP3 to
downregulate ILK and phospho-AktS473 in the lipid rafts
(Figure 2 and 3). ILK is known to regulate not only
cell survival and proliferation but also migration by
connecting the cytoplasmic domains of β-integrins to the
actin cytoskeleton in diverse cell types [22]. Our results,
however, demonstrated that rVP1-mediated inhibition
of ILK resulted in the downregulation of IKK/NF-κB
signaling and COX-2/PGE2 expression (Figure 3C and
3D). Overexpression of ILK or NF-κB p65 blocked the
inhibitory effect of rVP1 on COX-2 expression (Figs.
3E) to induce MIG-7, EMT and MMP2 activity as well
as invasiveness of lung cancer cells (Supplementary
Figure 1). Moreover, overexpression of COX-2 or MIG7 reversed the inhibitory effects of rVP1 on invasion/
migration (Figure 4A and 4B). ILK may thus upregulate
COX-2 and MIG-7 to enhance EMT and migration/
invasion of cancer cells. Whether rVP1 can regulate
the actin cytoskeleton to attenuate COX-2 and MIG7 or regulate COX-2 and MIG-7 to attenuate the actin
cytoskeleton remains to be elucidated.
EMT is enhanced by transcription repressors
notably, ZEB1, Twist and Snail that interact with E-box
elements located within the proximal region of the
E-cadherin (CDH1) promoter to suppress E-cadherin
[17, 25]. Phosphorylated prohibitin has been shown
to decrease E-cadherin via increasing ZEB1 and Snail
but not Twist [15]. In comparison, MIG-7 decreases
E-cadherin by increasing ZEB1 and Twist but not Snail
[12]; (Supplementary Figure 3). rVP1 suppresses cervical
cancer cell metastasis by decreasing membrane bound
PIP3 leading to modulation of phospho-PHBT258 in the
lipid rafts of the cervical cancer cells and inactivation of
Raf-1/ERK [15]. Since rVP1 also downregulated MIG-7

Purification of recombinant VP1 protein

Extraction of cellular proteins

Purification of recombinant VP1 protein was carried
out as described previously [28]. In brief, the VP1 gene
in the expression vector pET24a(+) (Novagen, Madison,
WI) was expressed in Escherichia coli. After breaking
up the bacteria with a microfluidizer in TEN buffer (50
mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl), the
pellet was washed with 0.5% deoxycholate in TEN buffer,
followed by rinsing with TEN buffer and resuspended in
binding buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl,
8 M urea). The solution was then applied to a metalchelating affinity column and eluted with a gradient of
0–0.2 M imidazole. SDS was then added to the protein
solution to a final concentration of 1%. The protein
solution was subsequently applied to a Superdex 200
column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and eluted with
a buffer solution containing 25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 1
mM EDTA, 0.1 M NaCl and 0.05% SDS. The fractions
containing rVP1 protein were pooled, concentrated and
dialyzed against PBS before use.

Sixty milligrams of frozen tissue was immersed in
2 ml RIPA buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) containing
proteinase and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany) and then lysed with homogenizer at
4°C. After centrifugation at 14000 × g for 60 min at 4°C,
the pellets were discarded and the supernatant containing
proteins was stored -80°C until needed. Equal amounts
of protein (60 μg) were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE and
transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA)
for western blot (immunoblot) analysis.

Extraction of membrane raft proteins
Membrane raft proteins were extracted as described
previously [29]. Briefly, cells (2 × 106) were washed in icecold PBS and lysed by incubation for 30 min in ice-cold
lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM
Tris–HCl, pH 7.5) containing proteinase and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Roche). After centrifugation at 14,000
rpm for 30 min at 4°C, the supernatants (containing the
Triton X-100 soluble fractions) were collected and referred
to as the cytosolic plus non-raft membrane (C+M) fraction.
The insoluble pellets were resuspended in the same lysis
buffer supplemented with 0.5% SDS and 2 mM DTT
and sonicated for 10 min at 4°C. After centrifugation at
14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C, the supernatants consisting
of membrane raft proteins were collected and analyzed by
immunoblotting.

Knockdown and overexpression of proteins
Full-length human COX-2 cDNA (NM 000963.2)
and human MIG-7 (DQ080207.2) cDNA derived from
A549 cells were amplified by using specific primers
(Supplementary Table 1) (Sigma-Proligo, St Louis,
MO) and subcloned into pcDNATM6/BioEaseTM-DEST
by Gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) to generate pCOX2 and pMIG7 plasmids. The insert
sequences in the plasmids were confirmed by automated
DNA sequencing. pUSEamp, pUSEamp-myr-Akt1

Immunoblotting and gelatin zymographic analysis

µl PBS/mouse) were injected into male SCID mice
per group via the tail vein. Metastatic progression was
monitored weekly and quantified using a noninvasive
bioluminescence IVIS Imaging System (Xenogen,
Alameda, CA) as described previously [16]. After 5
weeks, three mice were killed for necropsy and the other
8 mice were kept for survival studies. The lungs of the
sacrificed mice were isolated, collected and processed
for H&E/immunohistochemistry staining. The number of
tumor colonies in the lungs was counted, and relative lung
weight (lung weight/body weight) was recorded.

Immunoblotting and gelatinolytic activities of
matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 were
performed as described previously [12, 30].

Migration and invasion assays
In vitro migration and invasion assays were
performed as described previously [12, 30].

Experimental xenograft murine metastasis assay
to test in vivo effects of rVP1

ELISA for PGE2
The levels of intracellular and secreted PGE2 in the
cell lysate and cell-conditioned medium were measured
using a commercially available PGE2 EIA assay kit
(Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Male SCID mice (n = 11/group) were implanted
with 50 µl RPMI medium (vehicle) or 1 × 106/50 µl tumor
cells (CL1-5GL) on day 0 by lateral tail vein injection.
Metastatic progression was monitored weekly and
quantified using a noninvasive bioluminescence IVIS
Imaging System (Xenogen, Alameda, CA) as described
previously [16]. One week after lateral tail vein injection,
one group of mice was treated with vehicle and another
group was treated with rVP1 (5 or 15 mg/kg body weight
in 100 µl PBS) via tail-vein injection three times per
week for 4 weeks. Three mice in each group were killed
for necropsy and the other 9 mice were kept for survival
studies. The lungs of the sacrificed mice were isolated,
collected and processed for H&E/immunohistochemistry
staining. The number of tumor colonies in the lungs was
counted, and relative lung weight (lung weight/body
weight) recorded.

ELISA for PIP3
H1299 and CL1-5 cells (1 108) were treated
with or without rVP1 for 24 h in 0.5% FBS medium.
The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and
phospholipids were extracted and PIP3 levels were
measured by ELISA assay using PIP3 Mass ELISA Kit
(Echelon Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Preparation of pCMV-GFP/luciferase-lentivirus
and establishment of stable CL1-5GL cell lines

Immunohistochemistry
examination

To generate CL1-5 cells expressing both green
fluorescent protein (GFP) and luciferase in CL1-5
cells, pCMV-GFP/luciferase-lentivirus was prepared
as described previously [16]. CL1-5GL cells were then
produced by infecting CL1-5 cells with pCMV-GFP/
luciferase-lentivirus. Flow cytometric analysis revealed
that more than 99% of cells expressed GFP. Cell lysates
were also harvested for validation of luciferase activity
using a Minilumat LB 9506 luminometer (Berthold,
Wildbach, Germany). Luciferase activity was confirmed
by measuring the photon counts of serial cell dilutions
(1~105) by the IVIS Imaging System (Xenogen, Alameda,
CA).

histopathology

The mouse tissue samples were embedded in
paraffin and cut to 4 μm thicknesses. Samples were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunostained
with different antibodies, and examined in the same
manner as described previously [16, 30]. The images were
scanned into a digital format by Scanscope XT system
(Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA) and analyzed using
Aperio ImageScope 9.1 software (Aperio Technologies).

Statistics
All statistical comparisons were made with twotailed tests. The survival time was assessed using KaplanMeier curves and tested for significance by the log-rank
test. Statistical evaluation was performed using GraphPad
Prism version 5.0 for Microsoft Windows (GraphPad
Software, La Jolla, CA). Differences between groups were
considered statistically significant at *P < 0.05 or **P <
