Abstract
Transcription factor E2F1 has been implicated in both
apoptosis-promoting and apoptosis-suppressing effects. However, factors that mediate its antiapoptotic effects are still not
identified. Using prostate tumor–derived cell lines, we showed
here that E2F1 activated the expression of transcription factor
EGR1 for promoting cell survival. E2F1 up-regulated the
production of EGR1-induced growth factors, epidermal
growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin-like
growth factor II, which in turn activated the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt pathway to resist drug-induced apoptosis.
Moreover, E2F1 directly induced the transcription of the Egr1
gene using the KB site located in its proximal promoter.
E2F1 physically interacted with the RelA subunit of nuclear
factor-KB and modulated its transactivity to fully activate
EGR1 transcription. Together, these studies uncovered a novel
mechanism for E2F1-induced suppression of apoptosis in
prostate cancer. [Cancer Res 2009;69(6):2324–31]

Introduction
Transcription factor E2F1 not only promotes cell proliferation
but also induces apoptosis in cancer. For example, both reduced
proliferative and apoptotic rates were evidenced in SV40 T121–
induced tumors in E2F1 knockout mice, suggesting a paradoxical
role for E2F1 in tumors (1). Therefore, it was considered as both
oncogene and tumor suppressor (2–4). The antiapoptotic function
of E2F1 was first observed to protect cells from UV-induced
apoptosis in p53-deficient mice (5); however, the mechanism
governing such apoptosis-suppressing action of E2F1 is still
unclear. Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling is a major
survival pathway that can be activated by various stimuli such as
growth factors (6–9) and is widely involved in the inhibition of
apoptosis via regulating the activity of apoptotic factors such as
BAD, caspase-9, and Mdm2 (10–12). It has been reported recently
that E2F1 inhibited c-Myc–driven apoptosis via inducing a
PIK3CA/Akt/mTOR cascade in human liver cancer (13), implicating a potential link between the oncogenic function of E2F1 and
the activation of Akt. Grb-associated binder 2 (Gab2), a receptor
docking protein in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, is identified as
a target gene of E2F1, which is responsible for the activation of Akt

by E2F1 (14). However, tumors induced by the neu(ErbB-2)
oncogene in Gab2 / background showed normal Akt activities,
suggesting a dispensable role of Gab2 in activating Akt in tumor
(15). Thus, it is still not clear how E2F1 enhances PI3K/Akt
signaling.
Clinical studies showed that EGR1 expression level was
significantly increased in prostate cancers and directly correlated
with Gleason score and tumor grade (16). This oncogenic role does
not seem to extend to other tumor types, such as skin tumor,
fibrosarcoma, and glioblastoma in which EGR1 acts as a tumor
suppressor gene through multiple mechanisms, including inducing
p53 and PTEN expression (17). Indeed, EGR1 deficiency results in a
significant delay in tumor initiation, mortality, and progression
from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive carcinoma;
and inhibition of EGR1 expression reverses the transformation of
prostate carcinoma both in vivo and in vitro (18, 19). Moreover,
EGR1 physically interacts with androgen receptor and induces the
prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia carcinoma transition via transcriptionally activating growth and angiogenic factors such as
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor
(IGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor, and
vascular endothelial growth factor (20, 21), all of which contribute
to hormones refractory to prostate cancer (22, 23). Together, these
observations indicate a critical role for EGR1 in promoting prostate
cancer development. However, what causes EGR1 overexpression
and which factors control its expression in prostate cancer are still
poorly understood.
Here, we show that E2F1, by associating with nuclear factor-nB
(NF-nB), maximally induces the expression of EGR1. Elevated EGR1
then induces the production of a panel of growth factors, including
at least EGF, PDGF, and IGF-II, etc. In turn, these growth factors
activate PI3K/Akt and promote resistance to drug-induced
apoptosis. Together, our study has identified a novel E2F1-induced
cell survival pathway.

Materials and Methods
Reagent and antibodies. All reagents, chemicals, and affinity-purified
anti-rabbit IgG, anti-mouse IgG, and anti-goat IgG conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent tags were purchased from Sigma.
The following specific antibodies were used in this study: anti–NF-nB p65
and p50 (Upstate Biotech); anti-E2F1, EGR1, DP-1, InB, Akt, histone H1, and
actin (Santa Cruz Biotech); and anti-BCL2, BCL-XL, phosphorylated Akt
(p-Ser473), and phosphorylated InBa (p-Ser32/36; Cell Signaling).
Short hairpin RNA expression, small interfering RNA duplex, and
reporter gene constructs. The pU6+27, short hairpin RNA (shRNA)

initial studies, we used empty vector (pU6+27) and scrambled shRNA as
controls. Double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting the
CDS: 891 to 909 of NF-nB (p65) and scrambled control was synthesized
using the following sequences: siRNA-p65; forward, 5¶-GAU UGA GGA GAA

To construct the EGR1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter, a 760-bp
DNA fragment from the promoter region of the EGR1 gene, including 70
to 846 nucleotides upstream of the start ATG, was obtained by PCR using
human genomic DNA as the template and primers EGR1-pf, 5¶-gaC TCG
AGG CTC ACT GCT ATA CAG TGT C-3¶; and EGR1-pr, 5¶-cgA AGC TTT ACA
TGG CAT ATA TGG GAA GC-3¶, where the restriction enzyme sites for
cloning are indicated by italics. The PCR products were inserted into the
pGL3-basic vector (Promega) and designated as pGL3-Egr1-wt. The nB-like
motif was mutated using site-directed mutagenesis correspondingly to two
possibly overlapped NF-nB binding sites (indicated in Fig. 4A). All the
constructs were verified by sequencing.
The pcDNA3 expression vectors with E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 expressed were
provided by Dr. Mian Wu (University of Science & Technology of China, Hefei,
China) and described previously (24). EGR1 expression plasmids were
generous gifts from Dr. Jie Du (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX).

Cell culture and transfection. DU145 and PC3, human prostate cancer
cell lines, were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and
cultured at 37jC in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
2 mmol/L of L-glutamine. LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen Corporation)
was used for transfection. Stably transfected cell lines were obtained after
being selectively screened by G418 (700 Ag/mL; Life Technologies) for 3 to
4 weeks.
Immunoblot analyses. Whole cell extract were prepared by lysing cells
in the NP40 lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/L of Tris-Cl (pH 6.8),
150 mmol/L of NaCl, 1 mmol/L of EGTA, 1% NP40, and freshly added
proteinase inhibitors including 1 mmol/L of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
1 Ag/mL of leupeptin (Sigma), 1 Ag/mL of pepstatin (Sigma), and 1 Ag/mL
of aprotinin (Sigma). For preparing the nuclear extract, cytoplasmic
membranes were disrupted in 0.5% NP40, 25 mmol/L of Hepes (pH 7.5),
5 mmol/L of KCl, 0.5 mmol/L of MgCl2, 1 mmol/L of DTT, and proteinase
inhibitors; then nuclei were collected by centrifuging at 2,500 rpm for
1 min and lysed in 25 mmol/L of Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 0.01%
NP40, 350 mmol/L of NaCl, 1 mmol/L of DTT, and proteinase inhibitors.
Lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence
detection (Pierce Chemical, Co.) was used to detect the specific immunoreactive proteins.

Figure 1. E2F1 suppressed drug-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells and was correlated with EGR1 expression. A, expression levels of E2F1 and EGR1 in
the parental PC3 and DU145 cells were assessed by RT-PCR and immunoblot assays, and the cellular sensitivity to 5-FU–induced apoptosis was determined by
Annexin V/PI staining after exposing the cells to 0.5 mg/mL of 5-FU for the indicated times. 5-FU–induced inhibition of cell growth was measured by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay after exposing the cells with the indicated dosage of 5-FU for 48 h. The same assays performed
in A were applied on the DU145-derived cells (B ) and PC3-derived cells (C).

Figure 2. Neither NF-nB nor BCL-2 expression were altered in E2F1 knockdown cells. The whole cell lysates (WCL ), nuclear extracts (NE ), and cytoplasmic extracts
(CP ) from cells were used for the immunoblot assays with the specific antibodies (A). Fluorescent immunostaining with either anti–NF-nB p65 or p50 followed
Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody was performed on the indicated cells (B). Whole cell lysates from the cells treated with 0.5 mg/mL of 5-FU for the indicated times
were immunoblotted with the specific antibodies (C ).

Reverse transcription-PCR. One microgram of isolated total RNA was
converted to cDNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).
Gene-specific PCR was conducted using the primer sets indicated in
Supplementary Table S1. The PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose
gel and then visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
Immunoprecipitation. Cellular lysates were prepared using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1% NP40,
0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 Ag/mL aprotinin, 1 Ag/mL leupeptin,
1 Ag/mL pepstatin, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and 1 mmol/L NaF]. An equivalent
amount of total proteins were incubated with 2 Ag of specific antibody or
control IgG at 4jC overnight. The immunocomplexes were captured by
incubation with protein A-agarose at 4jC for 2 h and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting with specific antibodies.
Annexin V staining and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. For apoptotic analysis, cell apoptosis detection
kit (BD Bioscience) was used. After treatment with 0.5 mg/mL of
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for the indicated times, cells were washed with
1 binding buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L
KCl, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, and 1.8 mmol/L CaCl2], then incubated with FITCconjugated Annexin V and 5 Ag/mL of propidium iodide (PI) in the dark
for 30 min, and analyzed with FACSCalibur (BD Bosciences) immediately.
Standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was performed to measure the proliferation of 104 cells treated with
drugs for 48 h in 96-well plates. These data represent at least three
independent tests and each test with triplicate samples.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Cells were seeded 24 h prior
to fixation with 1% formaldehyde at 37jC for 7 min. The cells were
harvested in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 8.1), 10 mmol/L EDTA, and
1% SDS] and sonicated to shear the chromatin (f500 bp). The soluble
fraction was collected by centrifugation and incubated with specific
antibodies or control IgG at 4jC overnight. The immune complexes were
captured with protein A-agarose beads. After extensive washing, the bound

DNA fragments were eluted and purified. DNA from these samples was
subjected to PCR analyses with NF-nB-BS-pf, 5¶-GCG GCT AGA GCT CTA
GGC-3¶; and NF-nB-BS-pr, 5¶-GCA GAA GCC CTA ATA TGG C-3¶;
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-pf, 5¶-GTA TTC CCC
CAG GTT TAC AT-3¶; and GAPDH-pr, 5¶-TTC TGT CTT CCA CTC ACT
CCT-3¶. The PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gel and visualized
by ethidium bromide staining. The GAPDH promoter fragment acted as the
internal negative control for this assay.
Luciferase reporter assays. Briefly, an appropriate amount of the Egr1
promoter-luciferase reporters, together with Renilla luciferase plasmids,
which served as the internal control, were cotransfected into cells. Two days
later, cellular lysates were subjected to a dual-luciferase reporter assay
(Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The luciferase
activities for the promoter reporters were normalized to Renilla luciferase
activities. The data represented at least three independent experiments, and
in each experiment, tests were done in triplicate for all the samples.
Immunofluorescence. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with
acetone/methanol (1:1) for 1 min After blocking with 5% normal goat
serum for 30 min at 37jC, they were incubated with anti-p65 or anti-p50
overnight at 4jC. They were then incubated with Cy3-conjugated antirabbit IgG (Sigma) for 30 min at 37jC and photographs were captured with
a confocal laser scanning microscope.

Results
E2F1 expression levels were correlated with resistance to
drug-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. To examine
the influence of E2F1 on prostate cancer cell survival in response to
chemotherapeutic drugs, two of the most commonly used
androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC3,
were screened for the expression of E2F1 by reverse transcriptionPCR (RT-PCR) and immunoblot analyses (Fig. 1A). Because our

E2F1 and Prostate Cancer

recent microarray analyses identified EGR1 as a potential target
of E2F1 (data not shown), we also monitored EGR1 expression in
the same samples. Both E2F1 and EGR1 were expressed at a
significantly higher level in DU145 than in PC3 cells. We next
determined if these cells were differentially sensitive to the growthsuppressive action of 5-FU, a commonly used cancer therapeutic.
Consistent with the higher levels of E2F1 and EGR1 expression,
DU145 cells were more resistant to 5-FU–induced apoptosis than
PC3 cells (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when cells were
treated with another DNA-damaging drug, cisplatin (data not
shown). Next, we investigated whether the insensitivity to druginduced apoptosis was due to E2F1. Plasmids expressing shRNA
specifically against E2F1 and wild-type E2F1 protein, respectively,
were used for establishing the stably transfected cell lines
(knockdown in DU145 and overexpression in PC3, respectively)
that were validated by RT-PCR and immunoblot (Fig. 1B and C).
Consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1A, knockdown of E2F1
resulted in the down-regulation of EGR1, whereas overexpression
of E2F1 resulted in elevated EGR1. The apoptosis and proliferation
assays showed that inhibition of E2F1 expression in DU145
increased sensitivity to 5-FU–induced apoptosis and reduced
proliferation compared with the scrambled control (Fig. 1B).
Conversely, elevation of endogenous E2F1 in PC3 cells significantly

diminished 5-FU–induced apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained with cisplatin
treatment (data not shown). Cell cycle analyses showed a
significant delay in G1-S transition upon the loss of E2F1, but not
EGR1, in DU145 cells (data not shown). In sum, E2F1 levels
controlled the expression of EGR1 in prostate cancer cells and
determined their sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis.
Neither NF-KB nor BCL-2 expression were altered in E2F1
knockdown cells. Previous studies have shown that E2F1 could
inhibit tumor necrosis factor-a–induced NF-nB activation by
stabilizing its inhibitor InBa in endothelial cells (25). NF-nB has
been implicated in inhibiting apoptosis through a transcriptional
induction of multiple antiapoptotic factors, including BCL-2 family
proteins (26). Moreover, BCL-2 gene expression was also found to
be up-regulated by E2F1 in a large-scale microarray analysis (27).
Therefore, we tested whether changes in the activation of NF-nB
pathways or expression levels of BCL-2 family protein could
account for these antiapoptotic actions. Whole cell lysates, nuclear
extracts, and cytoplasmic extracts from DU145 expressing a
scrambled or E2F1-specific shRNA were subjected to immunoblot
analyses with specific antibodies (Fig. 2A). Although E2F1 was
knocked down efficiently, NF-nB pathway proteins, as well as DP1,
the dimerization partner of E2F1, was unaffected (Fig. 2A). These

5-FU for the indicated times before examining (A) the expression of EGR1 and E2F1 protein levels by immunoblot or apoptotic assays by Annexin V/PI staining.
B, DU145/Scramble and DU145/EGR1-RNAi were tested for EGR1 expression by immunoblot assay and then treated with 0.5 mg/mL of 5-FU for the indicated times
before apoptotic analysis. C, the transcript levels of EGF, IGF-II, and PDGF-a in the indicated cells treated or not treated with 0.5 mg/mL of 5-FU for 12 h were
determined by RT-PCR. D, Akt activation was examined by immunoblot assays with anti–phosphorylated Akt following 0.5 mg/mL of 5-FU treatment for 12 h.

Figure 4. E2F1 and NF-nB cooperatively regulated Egr1 transcription through a nB motif within the Egr1 promoter. A, human Egr1 promoter luciferase reporters
used in this study. The mutated nucleotides corresponding to nB-Mut1 and nB-Mut2 are indicated in italics. B, these reporters were used for luciferase assays in
PC3-derived cells. C, equal amounts of the expression plasmids for E2F1, E2F2, E2F3, or empty vector pcDNA3.1 were cotransfected with the pGL3-Egr1-wt reporter
into DU145, and luciferase activities were determined 36 h later. D, NF-nB p65 knockdown was confirmed in DU145 stably transfected with a plasmid expressing either
a scrambled shRNA control or a NF-nB p65-shRNA by immunoblot and RT-PCR. Promoter luciferase reporter assays were then performed as described in B .

biochemical studies were then confirmed by an immunofluorescent
staining of NF-nB p65 and p50 and the steady state nuclear
translocation of NF-nB was found to be unaffected by the
knockdown of E2F1 (Fig. 2B). Together, these data indicated that
E2F1 did not influence the constitutive activation of NF-nB in these
cells. Additionally, 5-FU treatment did not cause any discernible
changes on the expression of BCL-2 and BCL-XL (Fig. 2C),
regardless of the E2F1 status in these cells.
Suppression of drug-induced apoptosis by E2F1 is mediated
by EGR1. We next investigated the mechanism that mediates the
antiapoptotic function of E2F1. EGR1 has been shown to promote
prostate cancer progression by inducing the expression of growth
factors such as transforming growth factor-h, EGF, IGF, and PDGF
(17, 20, 21), which are critical for tumor development, growth, and
survival through activating the PI3K/Akt pathway (6, 8, 9). Because
we observed a close correlation between E2F1 and EGR1 levels and
that 5-FU induced stronger apoptosis in the presence of E2F1shRNA (Fig. 1), we next tested if restoring EGR1 levels could
diminish the apoptotic response in DU145 cells expressing E2F1shRNA (Fig. 3A). Using this strategy, we could avoid the additional
regulatory pathways induced by E2F1. The expression of EGR1
in cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3A). More
importantly, reintroducing EGR1 in cells lacking E2F1 abrogated
enhanced drug-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, knockdown of EGR1 in DU145 cells using a specific shRNA-expressing
vector led to an enhancement of drug-induced apoptosis compared
with the control cells (Fig. 3B), showing the survival-promoting role
of EGR1. Notably, a greater sensitivity and a time delay in response
to drug-induced apoptosis were observed in EGR1 knockdown cells

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (6). March 15, 2009

when compared with E2F1 knockdown cells (compare Fig. 3B
with Fig. 1B). Together, these data indicated that EGR1 is a critical
downstream effector of E2F1-induced suppression of apoptosis.
EGR1 regulates the expression of a number of growth factors
including EGF, PDGF-a, and IGF-II. Therefore, we tested whether
the expression of these growth factors was affected by the
depletion of E2F1 or EGR1 and 5-FU induction (Fig. 3C). These
results showed that regardless of 5-FU treatment, the expression of
all these growth factors was significantly inhibited upon the
knockdown of EGR1 and E2F1. Consistent with the loss of growth
factor expression, depletion of E2F1 or EGR1 significantly inhibited
both constitutive and 5-FU–induced activation of Akt, whereas
total Akt proteins remained unchanged (Fig. 3D). These observations suggest that the loss of E2F1 and EGR1 significantly impaired
the production of growth factors and the activation of Akt in both
5-FU–induced and basal levels in prostate cancer cells.
E2F1 regulated EGR1 expression through a KB element.
Next, we examined whether E2F1 directly regulated Egr1 transcription. Surprisingly, no E2F1 binding sites were found in Egr1
promoters using computational analysis and prediction. However,
previous studies have implicated that EGR1 can be transcriptionally regulated by NF-nB (28) through the proximal nB-like
regulatory motif located between 195 and 212 upstream of
the start codon of the human Egr1 gene (Fig. 4A). A careful analysis
of this region identified two potential overlapped nB-like sites,
Egr1-nB-1 and Egr1-nB-2, located between positions 212 to 203
(5¶-GGGCGCCTGG-3¶) and 204 to 195 (5¶-GGGATGCGGG-3¶),
respectively (Fig. 4A). Additionally, E2F1 has been shown to
interact with NF-nB p65 and promote its transcriptional activity on

E2F1 and Prostate Cancer

a subset of NF-nB–driven genes (29). Thus, it is possible that E2F1
may regulate EGR1 expression by interacting with NF-nB and using
the identified nB sites.
To elucidate such a hypothesis, we mutated nB-1 and nB-2 sites
(Fig. 4A) and tested the effect of E2F1. Luciferase reporters driven
either by the wild-type or mutated Egr1 promoters were transfected into PC3 cells expressing E2F1 or a control vector and their
expressions were monitored (Fig. 4B). Mutation of the nB-1 site,
but not the nB-2 site, significantly reduced the basal expression of
the reporter in PC3 cells. In the presence of E2F1 overexpression,
wild-type and nB-Mut2, but not nB-Mut1, expressed a higher level
of luciferase compared with those cells transfected with empty
vector (Fig. 4B). These data show that E2F1-stimulated expression
of EGR1 requires the nB-1 site.
We then examined if other members of the E2F family also
induce the EGR1 promoter. Based on the structural and functional
considerations, E2F superfamily members can be divided into two
subclasses: E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3a as transcription activators, and
E2F3b, E2F4, E2F5, E2F6, E2F7, and E2F8 as negative regulators
of gene expression (30). Therefore, we chose the transcriptional
activators, E2F2 and E2F3a, along with E2F1, to test their
capabilities in stimulating Egr1 promoter-driven luciferase expression. Expression vectors for E2F1, E2F2, or E2F3a were cotrans-

fected with wild-type Egr1 promoter luciferase reporter into DU145
cells (Fig. 4C) and luciferase activity was monitored. These
experiments showed that the Egr1 promoter responded only to
E2F1, but not to E2F2 and E2F3a, which indicates a specific effect
of E2F1.
Having asserted the importance of the nB-1 site for Egr1 gene
expression, we next determined if loss of NF-nB affected the
expression of endogenous EGR1. Therefore, we knocked down the
expression of NF-nB p65 subunit using vector-based RNAi in
DU145 cells. Loss of expression of p65 was confirmed by Western
blot and RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 4D). Knockdown of p65 resulted in a
dramatically decreased expression of endogenous EGR1, even
though these cells expressed comparable levels of E2F1, indicating
a requirement for NF-nB in regulating Egr1 expression. To examine
if the nB-1 site within the Egr1 promoter was required for E2F1and NF-nB–dependent expression of luciferase, promoter-reporters
shown in Fig. 3A were transfected into DU145 cells stably
expressing scrambled or E2F1-specific or p65-specific shRNA
(Fig. 4D). Although the wild-type and nB-2 mutant were expressed
normally, they failed to express in cells expressing either E2F1specific or p65-specific shRNAs. The nB-1 mutant was not induced
in any of these cells. Thus, the nB-1 site, E2F1 and NF-nB p65 are
required for inducing transcription from the Egr1 promoter.

p65, anti-p50, and anti-E2F1 antibodies. A pair of primers flanking the nB element within the Egr1 promoter was used in PCR. B, synthetic scrambled or NF-nB

expression of E2F1 and NF-nB p65 and ChIP assays (C ), as performed in A. D, formation of the E2F1/NF-nB p65 complex was examined by coimmunoprecipitation
using whole cell lysates from DU145 cells. Lysates that were not immunoprecipitated were used as the input to ensure equal loading and normal IgG was used as
immunoprecipitation controls in A, B , and C.

Recruitment of E2F1 was dependent on the binding of NFKB p65 to Egr1 promoter. Because E2F1 and NF-nB p65 and the
nB-1 site were required for regulating EGR1 expression, we further
investigated whether these transcription factors bound to the
endogenous EGR1 promoter. A chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assay was used for this purpose. A pair of primers flanking
the Egr1-nB-1 site was used for detecting the presence of Egr1
promoter in the immunoprecipitation products of DU145 cells
expressing E2F1-specific or scrambled shRNAs and PC3 cells
overexpressing E2F1 or not. As shown in Fig. 5A, significantly
reduced recruitment of E2F1 to Egr1 promoter was observed when
E2F1 expression was lowered in DU145 cells, whereas considerably
increased E2F1 was recruited when E2F1 was overexpressed in PC3
cells. Under these conditions, recruitment of NF-nB p65 and p50
subunits was unaffected regardless of the E2F1 levels. The control
ChIP reaction using normal IgG did not produce any detectable
bands suggesting the specificities of the ChIP assays. Therefore,
both E2F1 and NF-nB bind specifically to the nB site within the
Egr1 promoter.
Because p65 bound to Egr1 promoter independently of E2F1,
yet E2F1 was required for EGR1 expression, we next determined if
E2F1 binding to the EGR1 promoter was dependent on p65.
DU145 cells expressing the scrambled or E2F1-specific shRNA
were transfected with scrambled or specific siRNA capable of
targeting p65. The p65-specific siRNA, but not the scrambled
siRNA, suppressed the expression of p65 in both cell lines. The cell
line expressing E2F1-shRNA and transfected with p65-siRNA lost
both E2F1 and p65 proteins (Fig. 5B). A parallel set of cells treated
similarly with siRNAs were used for ChIP assays. Although a
normal recruitment of E2F1 and p65 occurred in DU145 cells,
a significant loss of E2F1 recruitment to the Egr1 promoter was
observed in cells transfected with p65-specific siRNA, indicating
the dependence of E2F1 binding on the availability of p65 protein.
As expected, E2F1 was not strongly recruited to the promoter
when cells expressed E2F1-specific shRNA (Fig. 5C). Thus, the
binding of E2F1 to the nB site of Egr1 promoter requires NF-nB
p65.
In the next experiment, we investigated whether the endogenous
NF-nB p65 and E2F1 proteins actually formed a complex in DU145
cells by coimmunoprecipitation. Lysates were first immunoprecipitated with p65-specific or a control antibody. The immunoprecipitation products were subjected to immunoblot analysis with
E2F1-specific antibodies. Indeed, the p65-specific, but not the
control IgG, coimmunoprecipitated E2F1. The input samples from
each reaction had equal amounts of E2F1 (Fig. 5D). Together, these
experiments suggested the formation of a transcriptional complex
consisting of E2F1/p65, which associated with the nB-1 site of the
Egr1 promoter.

Discussion
E2F1 is known to exert diverse effects on cell growth and
apoptosis depending on the cell context. In normal cells, transient
activation of E2F1 promotes cell growth by driving cell cycle
transition under the control of pRb, whereas its ectopic expression
causes E2F1-dependent apoptosis. In cancer cells, loss or
inactivation of pRb, the regulatory switch, leads to an uncontrolled
activation of E2F1. Owing to the dual role of promoting both
proliferation and apoptosis, the function of E2F1 in oncogenesis
remained controversial and highly dependent on certain regulators
such as p53 and c-Myc. In a p53 / background, overexpression of

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (6). March 15, 2009

E2F1 promoted the development of skin carcinoma and protected
cells from UV-induced apoptosis (5, 31). It was also observed that
E2F1 counteracted c-Myc–driven apoptosis and enhanced hepatocellular carcinoma development (13). However, the underlying
mechanisms behind this apoptosis-suppressing action of E2F1 have
not been identified. Here, we have uncovered an E2F1-induced
survival pathway which suppressed chemotherapeutic drug–
induced apoptosis in prostate carcinomas. In this novel pathway,
E2F1 directly induces Egr1 gene transcription and then elevated
EGR1 protein up-regulates the production of downstream growth
factors which subsequently activate the PI3K/Akt pathway.
Therefore, we found that oncogenic E2F1 promotes tumor cell
survival and attenuates apoptosis in human prostate cancer.
Recently, a widespread role of E2F1 in transcriptional regulation
has been indicated by an unbiased location analysis of E2F1
binding sites in the human genome (32). It is surprising that only a
small proportion (<15%) of E2F1-regulated gene promoters possess
the canonical E2F-binding sites. Perplexingly, E2F1 is recruited to a
large fraction (f25%) of human gene promoters via a mechanism
distinct from the recognition of consensus DNA-binding sites. Such
effects are likely to be mediated by the interactions of E2F1 with
other transcription factors, such as NF-nB. This hypothesis,
although originally based on computational analyses, was verified
in recent studies. Lim and colleagues described that NF-nB (p50/
RelA) rapidly recruited E2F1 upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation,
which was critical for full transcriptional activation of some
NF-nB–driven genes such as interleukin 1h, interleukin 23A, CCL-3,
and tumor necrosis factor-a (29). Furthermore, NF-nB has been
found to be involved in the regulation of more than 200 genes in
response to diverse stimuli, and could interact with more than
150 cellular proteins in various cells (33, 34). However, given a
certain condition, NF-nB only specifically regulates a subset of
genes, implicating that NF-nB–mediated transcriptional regulation
has promoter-specificity and cell-specificity that may be restrained
or facilitated by other cofactors such as E2F1 (35–38).
In this study, an example that supports the above hypothesis
was presented in which E2F1 regulated Egr1 transcription by
facilitating the transactivity of NF-nB and by using the nB site. We
showed that recruitment of E2F1 to the Egr1 promoter via the
inverted mechanism proposed by Bieda and colleagues (32) was
dependent on the binding of the NF-nB to the nB site. However,
recruitment of NF-nB alone was insufficient to fully activate Egr1
transcription. Only when both NF-nB and E2F1 were concurrently
available could the induction of Egr1 expression occur. Thus,
through modulating the transcriptional activity of NF-nB, E2F1
may participate in far more cellular functions beyond controlling
cell cycle transition and inducing apoptosis. In another view, our
report also pointed out the requirement for E2F1 as a coactivator
for full activation of some NF-nB–driven genes, which explained
how NF-nB differentially regulated target genes in response to
various stimuli.
Contrary to our study, Hoffman’s lab recently reported that EGR1
abrogated the E2F1-induced block in terminal myeloid differentiation for suppressing leukemia (39). This tissue-specific oncogenic
effect of EGR1 could be partially explained by frequent loss of
its downstream genes, p53 and PTEN (17), and natural inhibitor,
NAB2 (40), in prostate cancer and its capability to induce the
expression of tumor-promoting growth factors. Indeed, E2F1,
NF-nB, and EGR1 have been found to be overexpressed in prostate
cancer concurrently and play critical roles in proliferation, survival,
and metastasis (18, 19, 21, 41–43). NF-nB is constitutively expressed

and activated in prostate cancers, which parallels with tumor
development and progression (44, 45), whereas the expression
levels of E2F1 and EGR1 are gradually increased as the cancer
progresses, particularly during conversion into advanced and
metastatic stage (16, 41, 43). Furthermore, growth factors including
EGF, PDGF, and IGF have also been found to closely correlate with
Gleason scores in clinical prostate cancers (46). Together, these
data implicated that a possible cross-talk among these oncogenic
factors may contribute to prostate cancer progression. Our findings
provide the first molecular evidence for how these interactions
result in the loss of control over cell growth and the development
of drug resistance, which is commonly seen in most advanced
prostate cancers.
