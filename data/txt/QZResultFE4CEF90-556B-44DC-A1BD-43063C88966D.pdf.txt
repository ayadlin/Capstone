Abstract
The recent approval by the FDA of the combination of
anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1 mAbs for the treatment of BRAFunmutated unresectable or metastatic melanoma is a landmark for the development of cancer immunotherapy. On
October 18 to 22, 2015, a symposium was held in Pamplona

(Spain) to present and discuss the basic and clinical discoveries that have brought us to this milestone and to explore
other targets and immunotherapy strategies aimed at attaining
more efﬁcacious oncology practice in the short term. Cancer

Introduction

de Jussieu, Paris, France) provided an overview of the relevance of
the different types of cell death to shape and ignite immune
responses. Interestingly, some conventional antitumor agents are
able to induce a type of cell death that is able to prime an immune
response (5). The molecular dissection of the pathways required
for such immunogenic cell death allowed him to propose the
concept of "combinatorial immunogenic cell death," deﬁned as
the combination of cancer treatments to set in action the key
factors that render cell death immunogenic.

The Centre for Applied Medical Research of the University of
Navarra (Pamplona, Navarra, Spain) in collaboration with the
Areces Foundation had organized four international meetings in
the past, covering several aspects of cancer immunotherapy (1).
The approval in the last four years of the anti-CTLA4 and antiPD-1 alone or in combination has resulted in the ﬁeld of immunotherapy becoming a cornerstone for managing cancer in the
near future, ﬁnally harvesting a long-awaited crop of clinical
success (2). This ﬁfth meeting was held on October 18 to 22,
2015, with the title "Immunostimulatory Monoclonal Antibodies
and Immunomodulation: Harvesting the Crop." The approved
immunostimulatory mAbs were dissected from different points of
view: from basic science to clinical development, covering the
early clinical experience of medical oncologists. The general
feeling was overly optimistic and can be summarized with the
line from a Frank Sinatra song that Dr. Jeff Weber (Mofﬁtt Cancer
Center, Tampa, FL) frequently quotes in meeting presentations: in
immunotherapy, "the best is yet to come."
The main symposium was preceded by the closing ceremony of
the ﬁrst edition of degrees in immuno-oncology at the University
of Navarra. During the last year, 26 medical oncologists received
theoretical and practical training in understanding the basics and
practice of cancer immunotherapy. In this closing ceremony,
Pedro Romero (Ludwig Center for Cancer Research, Lausanne,
Switzerland) reviewed the evolution of immuno-oncology from
the pioneering work of Coley (3) to the new concepts of the
relevance of cell metabolism for the function of the immune
system (4). Lorenzo Galluzzi (Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers

Anti-CTLA-4 and Anti-PD-1 Antibodies
Dr. Jim Allison (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX)
provided an overview of the antitumor mechanisms of action of
the anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1 mAbs (6) and their use in combinations that result in synergistic effects. Dr. J. Allison received a
standing ovation in recognition of his seminal work on checkpoint inhibitors and the clinical development of ipilimumab as
the ﬁrst agent of this class ever to reach the market. Several
speakers expanded on these mechanisms, which are so important
for synergistic combinations (7). In this vein, Sergio Quezada
(UCL Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom) showed that
anti-CTLA-4 therapy, in a mouse model, decreases intratumoral
accumulation of T regulatory cells (Treg) by an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) depletion mechanism
mediated by FcgRIV on macrophages (8). These clear-cut mouse
tumor data are yet to be clariﬁed in the tumor microenvironment
of treated patients.
Ronald Levy (Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford,
CA) showed the effects of the intratumoral injection of unmethylated CpG nucleotides, a TLR9 agonist, in combination with antiOX40 and anti-CTLA4 mAb therapy in mice. This combination
decreases the number of T regulatory cells not only in the treated
tumor, but in distant lesions. It is becoming clear that depleting or
functionally controlling Tregs in the tumor microenvironment is
an incompletely met goal in cancer immunotherapy. A clinical
trial to test this combined local therapy in patients with B-cell
lymphoma is ongoing (NCT02254772). Pam Sharma (MD
Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) stressed the importance
of designing clinical trials taking tumor pre- and posttreatment
biopsies to decisively increase our knowledge and showed

additional mechanisms of action of anti-CTLA-4 with the help
of state-of-the-art immunohistology, ﬂow cytometry, and gene
expression techniques. Similarly, Christian Ottensmeier (University of Southampton School of Medicine, Southampton, United
Kingdom) explained how genomic assessment of tumor immune
proﬁles using RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, and/or Gene-Seq can be implemented in cancer immunotherapy clinical trials and showed
examples in head and neck cancer tissue samples. Pam Sharma
gave an example of the usefulness of this approach, unraveling
this complex issue to show that increased expression of ICOS
in CD4þ T cells of ipilimumab-treated patients provided the
rationale for a synergistic combination treatment (9).
Antoni Ribas (UCLA Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA) revised
the requirements for anti-PD-1 efﬁcacy and showed that, in a
mouse model, both CD4þ and CD8þ T cells were required in
addition to costimulation through CD80/86 and CD28 upon
antigen presentation by dendritic cells (DC). In line with this, I.
Melero showed that Batf-3–dependent DCs were critical for the
therapeutic effects of immunostimulatory mAbs, anti-CD137,
and anti-PD-1 in mouse models (10). Antoni Ribas demonstrated
that most human melanoma cell lines can be induced to express
on their surface PD-L1 upon type I or II IFN stimulation but that
defects in the IFN signaling pathway can explain the loss of
induction of PD-L1 and consequently the lack of activity of
anti-PD-1 at least in a fraction of patients.
Janis Taube (Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD) focused
her talk on the clinical relevance of pretreatment expression of
PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment and its role as a biomarker
to predict the outcome of PD-1 pathway blockade. She showed
data demonstrating that this association between PD-L1 expression and response to therapy is independent of the solid tumor
type studied, number of pretreatment samples analyzed, IHC
method chosen, antibody used, agent tested, threshold of positivity, and cell type scored (11). To predict positive outcomes of
PD-1 pathway–blocking therapies, anti-PD-L1 IHC assays, in
association with other single markers, are in the process of being
validated and tested with international harmonization efforts.
Suzanne Topalian (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine,
Baltimore, MD) stressed the importance of developing reliable
biomarkers to predict efﬁcacy and toxicity of immune-oncology
drugs. Her collaborative studies with Hopkins investigators
have provided evidence for the role of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway
in immune resistance in human papillomavirus–positive
(HPVþ) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
(HNSCC). PD-1/PD-L1 interactions create an "immune-privileged" site for initial viral infection and subsequent adaptive
immune resistance, suggesting a rationale for therapeutic
blockade of this pathway in patients with HPVþ HNSCC.
Another important biomarker candidate is the nonsynonymous mutational load of the tumor. Taha Merghoub (Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY) proposed analyzing the exome of tumors and using bioinformatic tools to predict
HLA-presented neoantigens in those patients who are to be
treated with anti-CTLA-4 (12) and anti-PD-1 mAbs. He also
proposed combining these antibodies with virotherapy based on
alphavirus-based viral particles, vaccinia virus, or Newcastle disease virus (13). Moreover, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors can
epigenetically derepress endogenous retroviral sequences inducing antiviral immune responses that can boost the antitumor
activity of anti-CTLA-4 mAbs. Dr. John Haanen (The Netherlands
Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) emphasized the

2864 Cancer Res; 76(10) May 15, 2016

relevance of neoantigens as biomarkers in cancer immunotherapy
and insisted on the importance of neoantigens recognized by
CD4þ T cells in melanoma. The presence of neoantigen-recognizing CD4þ T cells has been recently documented in tumorinﬁltrating lymphocytes of ﬁve of six cases (14). Dr. J. Haanen also
proposed another potential biomarker for anti-CTLA-4 therapy,
as elevated levels of LDH reﬂect an altered anaerobic metabolism
in tumors that locally damage T-cell functions and that are well
known to be associated with poor prognosis.
Caroline Robert (Institute Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France)
reviewed adverse events of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 agents. She
concluded that with clinical experience and appropriate management algorithms, immune checkpoint inhibitors can be safely
given to patients. These drugs induce a new class of adverse effects
as a result of supraphysiologic immune activation that may
overwhelm key tissue tolerance mechanisms. Immune-related
adverse events (irAE) associated with ipilimumab therapy include
dermatologic effects, colitis and diarrhea, endocrine effects, hepatotoxicity, ocular effects, renal effects, and neurologic effects,
among others. In some cases, these irAEs are associated with
response. For instance, vitiligo has been associated with clinical
responses in pembrolizumab-treated patients.
The combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors and radiotherapy was addressed by Sandra Demaria (Weill Cornell Medicine, Medical College, New York, NY). She showed that type I IFN
response is optimally induced by hypofractionated radiotherapy
and is critical for converting the tumor into an in situ vaccine and
achieving abscopal responses, that is, inhibition of nonirradiated
metastases. Interestingly, radiotherapy synergizes with antiCTLA-4 or anti-TGFb and anti-PD-1 antibodies. Paolo Ascierto
(Fondazione Pascale Istituto Nazionale Tumori di Napoli, Napoli,
Italy) further advocated the relevance and convenience of these
types of treatment combinations. He reviewed clinical data of
several combinations of immuno-oncology drugs among themselves but also combinations of immuno-oncology drugs with
classical tumor treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
and targeted therapy. An interesting novel combination in his hands
is the use of electrochemotherapy with anti-CTLA-4 antibody.

New Avenues and Adventures in Cancer
Immunotherapy
Besides the ongoing success of checkpoint-blocking antibodies
and their combinations, other immunotherapies are marching
forward both preclinically and clinically. I. Melero showed that
targeting the T-cell costimulator CD137 in combination with antiOX40, anti-PD-L1 mAbs, and adoptive T-cell therapy provides a
new strategy to ﬁght a transgenic model of hepatocellular carcinoma, improving overall survival, host T cells recruitment into the
tumor bed, and CTL effector functions (15). Synergy between
CD137 agonist antibodies and adoptively transferred T cells has
also been demonstrated in a transplantable melanoma tumor
model. In this model, the stimulation by anti-CD137 enhances
the effector phenotype of transferred and endogenous tumorinﬁltrating lymphocytes as well as their mobility and effector
functions (16). A particularly efﬁcacious combination, including
the anti-CD137 agonistic antibody, was proposed by Holbrook
Kohrt (Stanford University Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA). On the
basis of the ﬁnding that antibodies that mediated ADCC enhance
the expression of CD137 on NK cells, he demonstrated synergy
with antibodies targeting CD20, EGFR, and Her2 that elicit ADCC.

Immunostimulatory mAb Meeting

Drivers of progress in cancer
immunotherapy involving
combinations. Building on the pillars
of partial success with PD-1/PD-L1
blockade, researchers will do their
best by exploiting data to construct
the best combinations based on
rational hypotheses (traditional
approach), interpretation of
omics high-throughput data, and
serendipitous unexpected
discoveries. During the meeting, the
main building blocks represented in
this ﬁgure were thoroughly discussed,
stressing that biomarker knowledge
and individual features of each cancer
patient and tumor will be common
denominators of progress. TIL,
tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocyte; CART,
chimeric antigen receptor T-cell
therapy.

Dr. Kohrt presented impressive efﬁcacy of the combination in
murine tumor models (17), which have given rise to ongoing
clinical trials (NCT01775631 and NCT01307267).
Anti-CD40 antibodies were presented by Rienk Offringa (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). Dr. Offringa
proposed their use for the treatment of pancreatic cancer based on
the previous experience with the combination of gemcitabine and
an anti-CD40 antibody (18). He demonstrated that most human
pancreatic cancers display T-cell inﬁltration and that tertiary
lymphoid structures can be found in this tumor. The molecular
mechanisms required for making good agonistic antibodies were
dissected in depth by Dr. Glennie (University of Southampton
School of Medicine, Southampton, United Kingdom). He showed
that agonistic antibodies targeting the family of TNFR need crosslinking by FcgRIIB, but the antibody can also be engineered to
obtain superagonistic antibodies independent of cross-linking,
tampering with the structure of the antibody to confer a more rigid
conformation of the hinge (19).
Cornelis Melief (Leiden University Medical Centre, ISA Pharmaceuticals, Leiden, the Netherlands) reported on the efﬁcacy of
synthetic long peptide vaccines against HPV and cisplatin in a
murine model of HPVþ cancer. This synergy is TNFa dependent,
and the addition of the vaccine allows the decrease of cisplatin
dose without efﬁcacy loss (20). The combination of cisplatin or
carboplatin with paclitaxel was found to reduce the number of

www.aacrjournals.org

myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in the tumor. Exploiting this new piece of knowledge, a phase I/II clinical trial
(NCT02128126) is ongoing, in which carboplatin and paclitaxel
regimens are combined with the polypeptide vaccine in women
with advanced HPVþ cervical cancer.
Alternative strategies to target Tregs were presented by J.J.
Lasarte. J.J. Lasarte focused on directly targeting Foxp3 because
it is an essential transcription factor for Treg biology. Moreover,
transient expression of Foxp3 on effector T cells after T-cell
receptor (TCR) stimulation may lead to T-cell hyporesponsiveness. Peptides that prevent Foxp3 nuclear translocation, dimerization, and action in Tregs block the immunosuppressive phenotype and recover the ability to express IFNg. Another approach
was interfering with the interaction between Foxp3 and NFAT,
allowing the enhancement of T-cell functions after TCR stimulation (21). Drew Pardoll (Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine, Baltimore, MD) showed that Tregs in tumors correlated
with Bacteroides fragilis bioﬁlm presence in the gut microﬂora in
murine models of colon carcinoma. This interesting relationship
appears to be mediated by the decrease of IL2 due to consumption
by Tregs that increases Th17 and IL17 in the B. fragilis–colonized
colon (22). This work highlighted the key role of the tumor
microbial commensal ﬂora in cancer (23, 24). The presentation
of Dr. Mario Colombo (Instituto Nazionale Tumori Experimental
Oncology, Milan, Italy) focused on the role of the extracellular

matrix by analyzing knockout mice for SPARC, a protein essential
for collagen assembly (25). Dr. M. Colombo's team observed
critical interactions of the collagen cellular matrix for shaping the
antitumor immune response, which resemble the way SPARC
contributes to the germinal center reaction and to all the other
stroma-dependent phases of B-cell development, also discovered
by Dr. M. Colombo.
George Coukos (University of Laussane Medical Center, Laussane, Switzerland), in studies of ovarian cancer, showed the key
role of vascular endothelial cells in shaping the tumor microenvironment. Tumor endothelium highly expresses FasL in a VEGF,
IL10, and PGE2 fashion that is able to kill tumor-penetrating
effector T cells but not Tregs (26). Moreover, the blockade of PD-1
also has a synergistic antitumor effect if combined with anti-VEFG
antibodies and aspirin against ovarian cancer mouse models.
Following this ﬁnding, a clinical trial has been proposed using
a combination of bevacizumab, aspirin, and atezolizumab for the
treatment of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
Dr. Francisco Sanchez-Madrid (Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid,
Spain) focused his talk on the multifarious functions of the
negative modulator of inﬂammatory processes CD69. He demonstrated a role of CD69 in the lineage commitment of CD4þ T
helper cells to Th17. CD69/ mice are characterized by an
increase in CD4þ T cells secreting IL17 upon antigen challenge.
For these effects, CD69 acts via Jak3/Stat5 signaling proteins.
Intriguingly, T cells in CD69/ mice present high levels of RORgt
transcript, a key Th17 transcription factor. Dr. F. Sanchez-Madrid
identiﬁed galectin-1 as an extracellular binding protein of CD69
and the negative effect of this interaction on Th17 cell differentiation (27). These immunomodulatory interactions deserve
attention in cancer immunity.
María Luisa Toribio (Centro de Biología Molecular Severo
Ochoa, Madrid, Spain) illustrated new major survival signaling
players in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). She
showed the role of IL7R, the pre-TCR and CD44, all Notch1
transcriptional targets in T-ALL, in the pathogenesis and bone

marrow engraftment of this disease. IL7R and pre-TCR are
expressed by T-ALL cells with leukemia-initiating cell activity,
and their aberrant expression and signaling are required for
disease progression in xenografted mice. From these data, new
promising immunotherapy targets are emerging for T-ALL.

Conclusions
Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 mAbs are achieving unprecedented
clinical success against a good number of malignant diseases. We
will build combinations on these solid pillars (Fig. 1), seeking
synergistic activities and paying attention to the individualized
tumor microenvironment, to the microbiota, and to the mechanisms of action operating in detriment of the tumor. It will be
important to determine which is the principal immune component to intervene upon in each cancer patient. The palettes of
biomarkers and immunotherapy agents are expanding rapidly.
Making the most of such possibilities and opportunities will need
expeditious and effective communication among academic
researchers, clinicians, and industrial partners. Such communication was fostered with the help of the Moneo-designed modern art
museum at the University of Navarra campus, which was our
meeting venue, and moderate quantities of excellent local wines
from the Navarra and Rioja regions.
