Abstract
Lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease encompassing a wide array of genetic abnormalities. The MET receptor
tyrosine kinase is altered in many lung cancers, especially non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and clinical
trials of MET inhibitors that are under way are documenting cases of acquired resistance. On the basis of the
evidence that the RON tyrosine kinase receptor can also be overexpressed in NSCLC, we evaluated the potent MET/
RON dual kinase inhibitor LY2801653 in this setting. LY2801653 was more efﬁcacious than the MET/ALK/RON/ROS
inhibitor crizotinib with a distinct pattern of downstream signaling effects. Using the PamGene platform, we found
that inhibition of MET and RON was associated with decreased phosphorylation of CBL, PI3K, and STAT3. In classic
and orthotopic mouse xenograft models of lung cancer, LY2801653 decreased tumor growth, dramatically inhibiting
mitotic events and angiogenesis. Taken together, our results argued that speciﬁc targeting of the MET/RON kinases
could provide robust inhibition of cell proliferation and tumor outgrowth in multiple in vitro and in vivo models of
NSCLC. These ﬁndings offer a robust preclinical proof of concept for MET/RON targeting by LY2801653 as a
promising small-molecule modality to treat NSCLC. Cancer Res; 74(3); 884–95. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Lung cancer is a global health problem, and can be divided
into non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung
cancer (SCLC). NSCLC can be further subdivided into various
histologies such as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC), and large cell carcinoma. As has been shown recently,
there are various molecular subtypes of NSCLC, such as EGF
receptor (EGFR) mutation (1, 2), ALK translocation (3), and
ROS1 translocation (4). We have previously shown that MET
receptor tyrosine can be a good target for NSCLC (5, 6).
MET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) can be activated
through a number of mechanisms, especially with ligand
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation. In lung cancer,
MET can be overexpressed along with HGF. There also can be
gain-of-function mutations within the semaphorin and juxtamembrane domain (5, 7, 8). In a subset of NSCLC, MET is
ampliﬁed (9–11). RON is a RTK similar to MET; however, its
activation is dependent on a separate ligand, macrophagestimulating protein. RON has been shown to be overexpressed
in NSCLC, and there are a number of isoforms in lung cancer
(12). Particularly, d 165 and 155 isoforms are known to be

potent oncogenes (13, 14). It seems that there is a strong
interaction of MET with its family member RON (15, 16).
Recent data indicate an increasingly important role for receptor cross-talk in the activation of MET and RON. MET/RON
complexes are present on the cell surface before ligandinduced dimerization, and ligand-stimulated MET activation
results in direct transphosphorylation of RON (15). Catenacci
and colleagues have shown that RON and MET costimulation
led to enhanced malignant phenotypes over stimulation of
either receptor alone using gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma
cell lines. They have shown that growth inhibition, as evidenced by viability and apoptosis assays, was optimal using
novel blocking monoclonal antibodies to both RON and MET,
versus either alone. They have also shown that combined
siRNA knockdown of RON and MET inhibited signaling feedback loops and led to optimal antitumorigenic effect (16).
Because only a subset of MET-expressing tumors respond to
anti-MET therapeutics, we hypothesized that MET and RON
could be better therapeutic targets in NSCLC. There are various
strategies to inhibit MET and RON—such as speciﬁc antibodies or small-molecule inhibitors (SMI; ref 17). The compound
LY2801653 is an SMI that has shown in vitro activity against
both MET and RON receptors at nanomolar concentrations.
In this study, we sought to determine the speciﬁc inhibition
of NSCLC cell lines with LY2801653. Compared with crizotinib,
we found LY2801653 to be more efﬁcacious in A549, H1703, and
H1993 cell lines. Concurrently, we were able to show dramatic
effects on mouse xenograft models. Interestingly, we show that
there are speciﬁc signal transduction pathways that are affected, which help in understanding the systems biology for MET/
RON pathways. These data support potential clinical development of LY2801653 for the treatment of NSCLC.

Novel Inhibitor LY2801653 with Effects on MET and RON in NSCLC

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
We used one human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B)
and 10 NSCLC cell lines (A549, H358, H520, H522, H661, H1703,
H1993, H2170, H2228, and SKMES-1) that were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection and cultured accordingly. A TPR-MET–expressing murine pre-B cell line, BaF3
TPR-MET, was generated by transfection of an expression
vector containing TPR-MET cDNA as previously described
(18). BaF3 was grown in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS and
10% WEHI-conditioned medium as a source of murine interleukin-3. A luciferase-tagged A549 cell line, A549-luc-C8, was
purchased from Caliper Life Sciences and grown in RPMI-1640
with 10% FBS.
MET/RON SMI LY2801653
The MET/RON SMI was provided by Eli Lilly and Company.
The drug was received in powdered form and dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) according to the company's
instructions and used at the indicated concentration.
Speciﬁc knockdown of MET/RON by siRNA
Targeted siRNA to MET and RON were used on A549 cells
individually and in combination for dual knockdown (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology; Met siRNA, sc-29197, Ron siRNA, sc-36434,
Control siRNA-D, sc-44232) using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
Transfection Reagent kit (Invitrogen; #13778-075). Lysates
from each siRNA treatment were immunoblotted to verify
gene knockdown and cell viability was assessed to determine
the effect of gene knockdown relative to siRNA control cells.
Detailed methods for this assay are described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell viability assay
Cell lines' sensitivity to MET/RON inhibitor LY2801653 or
siRNA was determined by performing cell proliferation assay
using standard MTT. Detailed methods for this assay are
described in Supplementary Materials and Methods. The
IC50 was generated for all cell lines. Similarly, the efﬁcacy of
crizotinib was determined. Crizotinib was purchased from LC
Laboratories.
Immunoblot analysis and antibodies
NSCLC cells treated with drug or siRNA were immunoblotted to evaluate the biochemical effects of MET/RON
inhibition. Untreated cells or control siRNA were used as
controls. Immunoblotting on whole cell lysates was performed
following routine protocols (19, 20). All antibodies used for
immunoblot analysis are listed in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.
PamGene tyrosine kinase array and run analyses
PamGene technology using the PamChip Tyrosine Kinase
Array allows the kinetic detection of the phosphorylation of
peptides spotted onto a three-dimensional porous well of a
four-array chip, produced and commercialized by PamGene.
This technology can be used to measure the activity of puriﬁed

www.aacrjournals.org

kinases and the effects of kinase inhibitors on them. Phosphorylation on these arrays is measured as described elsewhere (21). Detailed methods for PamGene analyses are provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods. The lysates of
H1993 cells treated with LY2801653 (1, 3, and 10 nmol/L) for 4
hours similar to the assay conducted for immunoblot analysis
were hybridized in four technical replicates. The data generated were analyzed with BioNavigator (Version 0.4.2.82;
PamGene).
Pathway and network analyses
Peptides found to be signiﬁcantly down- or upregulated in
the statistical analysis (P < 0.05) in PamGene were used for
pathway and network analyses using the bioinformatics analysis software MetaCore (GeneGo, Thomson Reuters) as
described in refs. 22 and 23. Several MetaCore tools were used
to analyze data and are listed in Supplementary Materials and
Methods. MetaCore's enrichment analysis tool uses hypergeometric modeling to determine the statistical signiﬁcance of
enrichment. "GeneGo Map Folders" (MetaCore tool) are organized to collect all GeneGo maps that describe different
canonical pathways involved in the same process. The significant process networks were noted, and relevant signaling
networks were assembled on the basis of the statistically
signiﬁcant data generated by PamGene fold-change
calculation.
Xenograft tumor model for LY2801653
Female homozygous athymic nude mice ages 5 to 6 weeks
were purchased from Harlan Laboratories and allowed to
acclimate for 1 week. Animal care was in accordance with
institutional animal care guidelines.
Approximately 2.5  106 A549 or 5  106 H1993 NSCLC cells
were inoculated subcutaneously in the right ﬂank of each
mouse. Tumor growth was measured with calipers and volume
(mm3) was calculated as (L  W  H)/2. When the volume
reached a mean of 200 to 400 mm3, mice were randomized into
two groups of 10 and 11 and treatment was initiated.
LY2801653 was administered twice a day for 4 weeks by oral
gavage at 20 mg/kg to one group, whereas the vehicle 10%
Acacia was delivered to the second group at same duration,
route, and dose. Body weight and tumor volume were recorded
every 3 days until the study was terminated and animals were
euthanized. Tumor tissues were excised and ﬁxed in 10%
buffered formalin and embedded in parafﬁn.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Parafﬁn-embedded blocks of all tumors were sectioned at
5 mm. Each sample was stained with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) for histopathologic analysis. Immunostaining was done
using antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 for apoptosis, Ki-67
for cell proliferation, CD31 for angiogenesis, and total MET,
phospho-MET, RON-b, phospho-RON with antibodies
described in detail in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
All samples from both treatment and vehicle groups (n ¼ 10 or
11) were analyzed. In addition to scoring staining intensity,
three random ﬁelds in each slide were evaluated for mitotic
ﬁgures and blood vessels (n ¼ 30 or 33). Positively and

negatively stained cell counts were divided by the total number
of cells counted to generate the percentage of positive cells in a
ﬁeld; the area of necrosis was determined and excluded from
evaluation of other factors.
Orthotopic lung cancer tumor model and imaging using
Xenogen IVIS
Six-week-old female severe combined immunodeﬁcient
(SCID) mice (Harlan Laboratories) were used to establish
orthotopic tumors in lung. Tumors were initiated by intrathoracic injection of 5  104 A549-luc-C8 cells in 25 mL of PBS into
the right lung percutaneously as described in ref. 24. Mice
were randomly divided into control and treatment groups (n ¼
9 per group), observed daily, and body weight measured twice
weekly. One week after inoculation, mice were given LY2801653
or 10% Acacia as vehicle control by oral gavage at 20 mg/kg
daily. To detect tumor, mice were imaged with Luciferin-D
using the Xenogen IVIS imaging system 200 series (Xenogen
Corporation) on Days 0, 7, 14, and 21 as described in refs. 24
and 25. Upon termination of study, mice were euthanized and
imaged with open chest. Lungs and other organs were formalin
ﬁxed and parafﬁn embedded. Sections were cut at several
depths to evaluate presence or absence of tumor in chest
cavity. Bioluminescence data collected from IVIS were used to
generate graphs comparing relative radiance in each mouse.
Statistical analysis
For cell viability assay, data were expressed as mean  SEM
and analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0d. For PamGene
analyses, log intensity values were analyzed using a paired twotailed Student t test comparing untreated controls with treated.
The statistically "signiﬁcantly modulated" genes were deﬁned as
those that had a P value of less than 0.05. This statistical analysis
was performed using BioNavigator (PamGene). For the xenograft tumor model, the P value between mean tumor volumes of
vehicle and LY2801653 treated was calculated by the two-tailed
Student t test using GraphPad Prism.

Results
Robust MET and RON expression in NSCLC cell lines
We ﬁrst examined the expression of MET and RON in a panel
of NSCLC cell lines of various histologies—adenocarcinoma
(A549, H522, H1993, H2228, H358), SCC (H520, H1703, H2170,
SKMES-1), and large cell carcinoma (H661). Seven of the 10
NSCLC cell lines (except H522, H2170, and H661) coexpressed
both MET and RON, with the highest level of MET being
expressed by H1993 (Fig. 1A). MET expression was detected
at 145 kDa and RON-b was detected at 150 kDa. BaF3 TPRMET, serving as the positive control, showed high level of MET
expression, recognized at 65 kDa.
Inhibitory effect of LY2801653 on growth of NSCLC cell
lines
To determine the effect of LY2801653 on cell proliferation,
we treated NSCLC cell lines with LY2801653 for 72 hours in a
dose range of 1 nmol/L to 10 mmol/L. BaF3 TPR-MET was used
as a positive control. Of the 10 NSCLC lines tested, A549, H1703,

886

Cancer Res; 74(3) February 1, 2014

and H1993 were found to be sensitive to LY2801653 at IC50
627.6, 72.9, and 9.28 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 1B). Similarly,
cells were treated with crizotinib. A549, H1703, and H1993 were
found to be sensitive to crizotinib at IC50 2,478, 3,848, and 45.4
nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 1C). BaF3 TPR-MET cells were also
found to be sensitive to crizotinib at IC50 40.1 nmol/L. For these
cells, the IC50 of crizotinib was higher than the IC50 of
LY2801653 (A549; 3.9-fold IC50, H1703; 53-fold IC50, H1993;
4.9-fold IC50, and BaF3 TPR-MET; 3.1-fold IC50). BEAS-2B
normal bronchial epithelial cells, which do express low levels
of MET (26), did not respond to MET/RON inhibition.
Biochemical effects of inhibition of MET and RON
To determine the biochemical consequences of MET and
RON kinase inhibition by LY2801653, we ﬁrst used BaF3 TPRMET cells. Changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular
proteins were evaluated using phospho-speciﬁc antibodies
against tyrosine phosphorylation sites in MET. We found that
50 nmol/L LY2801653 inhibited phosphorylation at Tyr361/
365/366 autophosphorylation sites on TPR-MET (Fig. 2A). To
determine whether LY2801653 also inhibited the activation of
MET and RON in lung cancer cells, we used H1993 cells.
Treatment of H1993 cells with LY2801653 at doses 1, 3, 10,
and 30 nmol/L reduced global tyrosine phosphorylation of
cellular proteins in a dose-dependent manner, as well as
tyrosine phosphorylation of MET at Tyr1230/1234/1235
(homologous to Tyr361/365/366 in TPR-MET) and tyrosine
phosphorylation of RON at Tyr1238/1239 (Fig. 2B).
Next, tyrosine phosphorylation of CBL (Tyr674), PI3K p85/
p55 (Tyr458/199), and STAT3 (Tyr705) was examined. We have
previously studied the relationship between CBL and NSCLC
(27, 28), PI3K and MET in SCLC (29), and STAT3 and MET/RON
in gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (16). Because of our
interest in these pathways, we picked CBL, phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K), and STAT3 from the PamGene and GeneGo
analyses of signiﬁcant genes associated with H1993 treatment
with 3 nmol/L LY2801653. Our data show that treating H1993
cells with LY2801653 reduced the phosphorylation of these
proteins in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). We used Tyr674
for CBL as both Tyr674 and Tyr700 are involved in cell motility.
One of the pathways LY2801653 may potentially be exerting
its effect is via inhibition of MKNK1/2, as reported by Yan and
colleagues (30). MKNK1/2 activities are measured by the
phosphorylation of its substrate eukaryotic initiation factor
4E (eIF4E) at Ser209. We analyzed the phosphorylated eIF4E
(ser209) level of A549 and H1993 cells treated with LY2801693
(Fig. 2C). Our data show that there was an incremental loss of
p-eIF4E protein expression with increasing dose of the drug in
both the cell lines, indicating that the MKNK1/2 pathway may
be one of the mechanisms by which LY2801653 inhibition
works. This provides a potential mechanism of action for
LY2801653.
Identiﬁcation of 13 key peptides whose phosphorylation
was modulated by treatment with LY2801653 (3 nmol/L)
in H1993 cells
Using the PamGene kinase array platform, we demonstrate
that treating H1993 cells with LY2801653 has a signiﬁcant

and Supplementary Fig. S1). The tyrosine kinase activity
responsible for most peptides was downregulated in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A).
Analysis shows that 13 substrate sites on 12 genes were
signiﬁcantly modulated by LY2801653 (P < 0.05). The kinases
that were inhibited are MET (Tyr1230/1234/1235), calmodulin
(CALM; Tyr100), tyrosine-protein kinase SYK (KYSK; Tyr525/
526), b-type platelet-derived growth factor receptor precursor
(PDGFRB; Tyr771/775/778, Tyr716), RON (Tyr1353), PI3K regulatory subunit a (PI3K85A; Tyr607), erythropoietin receptor
precursor (EPOR; Tyr426), linker for activation of T cells family
member 1 (LAT; Tyr255), VEGF receptor 1 precursor (VEGFR1;
Tyr1327/1333), STAT4 (Tyr693), and E3 ubiquitin-protein
ligase CBL (Tyr700; P < 0.05). Interestingly, the T-cell surface

glycoprotein CD3 z chain precursor (CD3Z; Tyr153) was the
only site, which was found to be signiﬁcantly upregulated (P <
0.05; Fig. 3B). A network between these 12 modulated genes was
created using the "Shortest Paths Algorithm, Build Network" of
GeneGo (Fig. 3C). EPOR and CD3Z were excluded from the
network to simplify visualization because they are not related
to NSCLC directly. Of note, 47 tyrosine kinase substrate sites on
40 genes were signiﬁcantly modulated when cells were treated
with 10 nmol/L LY2801653 (P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S1).

factor (P ¼ 1.86E-71) affected (data not shown).
Gene-speciﬁc dual inhibition of MET/RON
To provide evidence that dual inhibition of MET and RON by
LY2801653 may be more beneﬁcial than either MET or RON
inhibition alone, we conducted gene-speciﬁc inhibition studies. siRNA was used to silence either MET, RON, or both MET

was conﬁrmed by immunoblot analysis showing a marked
reduction in MET and RON protein expression compared with
control siRNA (Fig. 4A). Parental A549 is shown to express high
levels of MET and RON, which remain unchanged with control
siRNA. siMET eliminated MET protein expression almost
completely with no change in RON expression. siRON eliminated RON expression almost completely. With MET/RON
dual silencing, both proteins were reduced. Ninety-six hours
after transfection, the viability of cells silenced for MET or RON
or dual MET and RON was measured and compared against
control siRNA. We show that although cell viability was
reduced by 60% in either MET- or RON-silenced cells, the dual

inhibition resulted in a reduced viability to 22% (Fig. 4B). These
results not only show that speciﬁc inhibition of MET and RON
serve to reduce cell viability in A549 cells but also that dual
MET/RON inhibition has a synergistic effect, as depicted via
LY2801653 treatment.

Consistent with the in vitro experiments of GeneGo analyses,
mitotic ﬁgures (H&E staining) and vessels (CD31 staining) of
tumor specimens were signiﬁcantly decreased in LY2801653treated mice in both A549 and H1993 studies. Moreover, in the
treated arms of H1993, necrosis was increased and cell proliferation (Ki-67) was decreased. In the treated arms of A549,

the lung of all these mice (Fig. 6D).

Discussion
In this report, we describe a novel ATP-competitive, potent,
and highly selective dual SMI of MET/RON, LY2801653 and its
effect on NSCLC. MET/RON are important pathways in NSCLC.
In vitro and in vivo, there was considerable cell death with
LY2801653 treatment.
Over the past decade, there has been considerable data
generated on MET biology and therapy for lung cancer. In
lung cancer, MET and phosphorylated MET (especially juxtamembrane domain site pY1003 and autocatalytic site pY1234/
1235) are overexpressed in 40% of tumor tissues (31), and are
prognostic biomarkers (32). Like MET, RON and phosphorylated RON also are overexpressed in lung cancer (12), but
unlike MET, which can be mutated in lung cancer, RON is not
mutated. However, RON can have differential transcripts in
various tumors (33, 34) and it is not known which transcripts
exist in lung cancer. This would be important to determine
because oncogenic functionality of epithelial cells in the lung
may be dependent on different RON transcripts.
As has been shown, MET can be overexpressed or ampliﬁed
in tumors resistant to cytotoxic agents such as cisplatin (35) or
SMIs such as geﬁtinib (36–38). Recently, MET resistance was
observed using anti-MET antibody (MetMAb; ref. 39). The

mechanism by which MET acquires resistance is not known.
MET can also synergize with other targets such as EGFR in
NSCLC (40). A number of MET inhibitors are being tested with
EGFR inhibitors in lung cancers (41–43). However, in the most
recent trial using tivantinib with erlotinib versus erlotinib
alone (phase III trial; NCT01244191; ref. 44), no difference in
overall survival was observed (45). Our data show that MET/
RON may be important to cotarget in NSCLC. To better treat
tumors, a strategy that uses MET and RON dual inhibition
would be more desirable than inhibiting one pathway alone.
We found LY2801653 to be more efﬁcacious than crizotinib
in A549 (KRAS G12S), H1703 (PDGFRA ampliﬁed), and H1993
(MET ampliﬁed) NSCLC cell lines. We also showed that
LY2801653 was effective in in vivo models. Because of the
focused studies on LY2801653, it would be useful for the future
to compare all the SMIs versus antibody inhibition of MET
versus MET and RON. Interestingly, LY2801653 may also be
effective against tumors via inhibition of MKNK1/2 (30). Thus,
for the future, it would be interesting to determine the therapeutic inhibition of MET/RON in patients with lung cancer
harboring various mutations. We have determined the sensitivities of the LY2801653 in various NSCLC cell lines harboring
different "driver" mutations. Because NSCLC is a heterogeneous group of diseases, it is important to note that not all
NSCLCs will respond to the same strategy of inhibition.
LY2801653 inhibited A549, H1703, and H1993 cells but not
others tested. It is possible that this is related to the various
other abnormalities that exist within these cells. As well, these
are in vitro experiments, and more in vivo experiments should
be done in the future to determine if tumor–stromal interactions play important roles in the inhibition of the various cells.
In the future, it will also be prudent to have isogenic cell lines
with the various oncogenic and tumor suppressor abnormalities that exist or coexist in NSCLC.
Kinase assays on PamChip peptide microarrays provide
rapid identiﬁcation of substrates for the kinase under investigation. PamGene assay removes many limitations to assay

development because 144 peptides can be tested simultaneously. Computational pathway analysis (MetaCore; GeneGo)
provides detailed knowledge of the highest-ranked common
network and helps validate the implicated disease pathways.
Using PamGene and MetaCore tools, we found that several
downstream signal transduction molecules were affected with
MET/RON inhibition, including CBL, PI3K, and STAT3 (Fig.
2B, Fig. 3, Table 1).
CBL is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates RTK activity in a
number of different receptors, including MET, EGFR, PDGFR,
and VEGFR. In our initial study, we evaluated expression and
mutational status of CBL in archival NSCLC tumor tissue
collected from African Americans, Caucasians, and East Asians
(27). Interestingly, we found that CBL was expressed at relatively low levels and was mutated occasionally. The overall
mutation rate of CBL in NSCLC was 8.4% (10 of 119). Prelim-

892

inary functional studies of these mutants revealed defects in
their ability to ubiquitinate MET, and no discernable effects on
the ubiquitination of EGFR. Moreover, forced expression of
these mutants in an NSCLC cell line enhanced cell viability in
vitro (28). From these data and our data, this pathway may play
an important role in lung cancer carcinogenesis.
The PI3K pathway is fundamental for cell development,
growth, and survival. Its deregulation and contribution to
carcinogenesis has been well documented and reviewed in
the past, including in carcinomas of the lung. We have reported
that the PI3K pathway is crucially targeted via MET stimulation in SCLC (29). Now, this study ﬁnds that inhibition of the
MET by LY2801653 targets the PI3K pathway. Hence, PI3K also
may be an important target in NSCLC.
STAT3, one of the seven members of the STAT family, has
been the most strongly implicated member in tumorigenesis

(46, 47). We have previously shown in a gastric cancer cell line
that STAT3 is activated upon RON and/or MET stimulation (16).
As shown here in the MetaCore analysis data, STAT3 is the key
transcription factor affected by LY2801653 treatment of H1993
cells. Furthermore, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was also

reduced by LY2801653. The HGF/MET signaling pathway is
responsible for stimulation of cell motility and invasion (20, 48),
and STAT3 is responsible for at least part of the MET signal.
In this study, the antitumor efﬁcacy of LY2801653 was
evaluated in tumor models that (i) express MET/RON, (ii)

harbor MET gene ampliﬁcation, or (iii) harbor KRAS mutation.
We have conﬁrmed the effect of LY2801653 against NSCLC cell
lines using both heterotopic and orthotopic human xenograft
mouse models. In the heterotopic mouse model, LY2801653
inhibited the proliferation of tumors and decreased mitotic
cells and vessels signiﬁcantly. Modest but not notable differences in the expression of phosphorylated MET and RON was
detected in the treated versus untreated tumor tissues,
although, we had seen considerable effects on tumor growth.
It is unclear if there is a potential feedback loop that is crossactivating the phosphorylation and needs further exploration.
In the orthotopic mouse model, LY2801653 also inhibited
tumor proliferation.
The tumor microenvironment plays a major role in promoting tumor growth (49). In xenografts models, tumor location is
important in relation to sensitivity to chemotherapy (50) and is
a critical factor in targeted therapies. Taking these points into
consideration, orthotopic models have advantages over heterotopic models. These advantages include use of the relevant
site for tumor–host interaction, the ability to study site-speciﬁc
dependence of therapy, organ-speciﬁc expression of genes, and
replication of clinical scenarios. For these reasons, we used the
heterotopic models with two NSCLC cell lines, and only the
luciferase-tagged A549-luc-C8 for the orthotopic modeling. A
luciferase-tagged H1993 cell was not obtainable.
Finally, others and we have previously shown gain-of-function mutations of MET in lung cancers (5, 8, 20). There also
seems to be a differential response to the MET SMI SU11274 in
E168D versus N375S MET-mutant lung cancer cells (8).
Although MET and RON synergize in function, in terms of
mutated MET, it is not known if the interaction between a
mutated MET and RON remain the same. It would now be
interesting to test the various MET mutations in combination
with RON for efﬁcacy of the LY2801653 inhibitor. As further
therapeutics are developed, such as antibodies speciﬁc to MET
or RON, these would be important to test in combination with
the SMIs. Several inhibitors of MET and RON are currently
being investigated in clinical trials (17, 43). LY2801653 is also
being investigated in patients with advanced cancer (adeno-

carcinoma of the colon or rectum, head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma; phase I trial I3O-MCJSBA, NCT01285037). Because of its potent efﬁcacy at lower
concentration and against multi-targeted kinase especially
MET/RON, we believe that LY2801653 has a promising therapeutic potential in treating NSCLC.
In summary, LY2801653 is a novel, orally available multitargeted kinase inhibitor, which inhibits MET and RON signaling. It has signiﬁcant in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities
against MET- and RON-driven tumors. The results described in
this report provide justiﬁcation for advancing LY2801653 to
clinical development.
