ABSTRACT:
In the era of new and mostly effective therapeutic protocols, multiple myeloma
still tends to be a hard-to-treat hematologic cancer. This hallmark of the disease
is in fact a sequel to drug resistant phenotypes persisting initially or emerging
in the course of treatment. Furthermore, the heterogeneous nature of multiple
myeloma makes treating patients with the same drug challenging because finding
a drugable oncogenic process common to all patients is not yet feasible, while our
current knowledge of genetic/epigenetic basis of multiple myeloma pathogenesis
is outstanding. Nonetheless, bone marrow microenvironment components are well
known as playing critical roles in myeloma tumor cell survival and environmentmediated drug resistance happening most possibly in all myeloma patients. Generally
speaking, however; real mechanisms underlying drug resistance in multiple myeloma
are not completely understood. The present review will discuss the latest findings
and concepts in this regard. It reviews the association of important chromosomal
translocations, oncogenes (e.g. TP53) mutations and deranged signaling pathways
(e.g. NFκB) with drug response in clinical and experimental investigations. It will also
highlight how bone marrow microenvironment signals (Wnt, Notch) and myeloma
cancer stem cells could contribute to drug resistance in multiple myeloma.

INTRODUCTION

gene mutations and chromosomal translocations [1]. On
the other hand, oncogenomics studies have found only
a few differences that distinguish MM from MGUS [2],
because both conditions can present either a hyperdiploid
karyotype or a non-hyperdiploid karyotype [3] and similar
IgH or IgL chromosomal translocations [4], implying
that most above genetic changes may not contribute to
MM progression. MM pathogenesis can also be largely
explained on the basis of interaction of MM cells with
bone marrow microenvironment (BMME) components
and signaling pathways thereof leading to MM cells
growth and survival, angiogenesis, osteolytic lesions
and drug resistance (DR). In this respect, a variety of
candidates (genes/proteins) have been identified mostly

Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most
common but as yet incurable hematologic malignancy
characterized by infiltration in the bone marrow of
malignant plasma cells. MM is usually preceded by a
pre-malignant stage termed monoclonal gammopathy
of undetermined clinical significance (MGUS) which
progresses to overt MM at a rate of 0.5% to 3% per year
[1]. The major clinical manifestations are the outcome of
tumor expansion and survival within the bone marrow and
resistance to chemotherapy as the final sequel. Basically
MM displays a complicated karyotype and high level of
genomic/chromosomal instability associated with various

through gene expression profiling (GEP) studies, which
include heat shock proteins (HSPs), some miRNAs,
c-MAF, NFκB, Notch and Wnts and their relevant
signaling pathways. Perhaps the main feature of these
pathways which has made them attractive drug targets
is that they are mostly active in MM cells in the context
of BMME hence contributing to various aspects of MM
pathology especially DR. Furthermore, the new concept
of MM cancer stem cell (MMCSC) indicates involvement
of Notch and Wnt signaling pathways in biology of this
“MM-initiating” cell which takes advantage of bone
marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) protection, and indeed new
efforts on targeting MMCSC are ongoing [5].

leading to those markers being used as targets for MDR
modulation [12]. In MDR, it appears that mechanisms
controlling drug accumulation inside the cells are
defective, most possibly through altering membrane lipids
(ceramides) which in turn limit drug uptake or increase
drug efflux [13]. Interestingly, sphingosine-1-phosphate
(S1P), a metabolite of ceramide, can confer resistance to
drugs in hematologic cancers [14, 15]. The outcome of
above transformations is inhibiting apoptosis (which is
normal mechanism of most anti-cancer drugs), limiting
normal processes of drug detoxification and DNA repair,
and alteration in mechanisms of cell cycle control and
check points. It should be noted that gene mutations of
drug transporters or drug receptors could also contribute
to MDR phenotype [11, 16].
Notably, the concept of cancer stem cell (CSC) in
both solid and hematologic cancers indicates that “cancer
initiating cells” resist chemotherapy due to their ability to
self-renew, differentiate and remain relatively quiescent,
features in fact hampering the effects of chemotherapeutic
cytotoxic drugs which typically target rapidly dividing
cells [10, 17].
Genetic alterations in signaling pathways
downstream to target activation will also have effect
on drug response. In most cases, signals will impinge
on mutated oncogenes in latter pathways leading
to upregulation of survival and drug resistance or
downregulation of cell death responses. For example,
resistance to Trastuzumab (in treatment of HER-2 positive
breast cancer) can be due to upregulation of signaling
pathways downstream to HER-2, as a result of PTEN loss,
or mutations in PI3K or AKT1 [10]. Genomics technology
has now deciphered the impact of somatic mutations on
some critical oncoproteins including RAS, EGFR, BCRABL and many others. These somatic alterations cause the
tumors rely unusually on a specific molecular pathway or
signaling system. This has been referred to as “oncogene
addiction”, which is in fact excessive tumor dependence
on at least one gain-of-function gene mutation for survival
[9].

Drug resistance in malignancies: general concepts
Chemotherapy refractoriness tends to be a clinical
frustration in blood cancers and a variety of solid tumors
including breast, ovarian, lung, and lower gastrointestinal
tract cancers [6-8]. During the past decades, multitudes
of mechanisms have been suggested for this DR. For
example, drug may be prevented from entering the cells or
be pumped out of the cells; it may become enzymatically
inactive, mutation or alteration in expression of the drug
target, and derangement in mechanisms of apoptosis,
senescence and DNA repair could also contribute to DR.
Likewise, in hematologic malignancies DR eventually
happens although most acute leukemias respond efficiently
to chemotherapy at the beginning [8]. Basically, malignant
tissues consist of a heterogeneous population of cells
with different levels of sensitivity to chemotherapy [7,
9, 10]. Some of these cells may be easily eliminated by
the drug while others may become totally resistant. This
is in clear contrast to normal cells which usually respond
homogeneously to the chemotherapeutic drug. In most
cases, malignant cells may become resistant to a single
drug in which case DR can be circumvented by using a
combination of structurally and functionally different
chemotherapeutic drugs. However, cancer cells may
also become cross-resistant to various drugs leading to a
situation known as multiple drug resistance (MDR). The
main mechanism controlling MDR is overexpression of
an ATP-dependent efflux pump known as P-gp [11]. This
170KD protein is encoded in humans by MDR1 gene and
is the first known member of ABC (ATP-binding cassette)
transporter superfamily. In MDR phenotypes, P-gp is
overexpressed and through pumping the drug out of the
cells reduces the intracellular concentration of the drug
below minimum threshold for effective response, hence
rendering cancer cells drug resistant. Other members of
transporter superfamily include multi-drug resistance
protein-1 (MRP-1), lung resistance related protein (LRP)
and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). P-gp, MRP1 and LRP have been found upregulated and associated
with DR in acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemia patients

Drug resistance in multiple myeloma
In spite of current efficient therapeutic regimens
for MM patients, DR is perhaps still the major concern.
For instance, bortezomib which continues to be used
as a first-in-class drug in MM; many patients may
be intrinsically resistant to it or develop resistance in
the course of treatment. Although real mechanisms
of resistance to bortezomib in MM patients are not
yet deciphered, mutation in β5-subunit of proteasome
(PSMB5) (conflicting reports), derangement of stress
response, survival and antiapoptotic pathways have been
indicated to be involved [18]. During the past years many
studies were focused on the mechanisms underlying DR

in MM, and considering the complex and heterogeneous
nature of MM the number of these studies is noticeably
increasing. However, with that bulk of research in the
past and present, we still don’t know exactly how MM
progresses from its precursor state, how drug resistant
MM clones persist in the presence of effective therapies,
and why some MM patients relapse. Here to make a more
mechanistic picture of DR in MM based on the most recent
findings, we will pursue the discussion covering four
categories of explanations: a)-Impact of cytogenetic and
epigenetic alterations, b)-Role of deregulated signaling
pathways, c)-Role of bone marrow microenvironment, d)MM cancer stem cell.

Less frequent translocations, t(14;16) and t(14;20),
which upregulate expression of oncogenes c-MAF and
MAFB, respectively, have also been associated with
MM adverse clinical outcomes [22]. The deletion 17p13
is one of the most important prognostic markers in MM
which is observed in 10% of newly diagnosed patients
but increases significantly at later stages [21, 27, 30, 34].
This abnormality is associated with aggressive disease and
failed outcome even in the face of novel bortezomib or
IMiD-based modalities. In (del) 17p, TP53 heterozygosity
is lost leaving it in a monoallelic form. This mechanism
in fact limits the key role of p53 in controlling cell
cycle and apoptosis and might partly explain the failed
treatment. Additional genetic aberrations include c-MYC
rearrangements which occur in 15% of newly diagnosed
MM, 40% of advanced MM tumors and almost 90% of
human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs), indicating that
c-MYC overexpression is a marker of MM progression
[35-37]. Compared to MM, c-MYC is almost not detected
in MGUS [37, 38], and it has also been implicated in DR
in MM [39].
MM patients who relapse or become refractory
(primary or after a salvage therapy) carrying any
“bad” prognostic cytogenetic marker, might refer with
some level of (acquired/intrinsic) drug resistance [40,
41]. While the real impact of cytogenetic aberrations on
DR or MM relapse is not mechanistically understood,
in some cases experimental studies have yielded helpful
clues. For example, in patients with t(14;16) and t(14;20)
translocations where MAF genes are overexpressed, it was
shown that blocking MEK pathway could downregulate
MAF, inhibit cell proliferation and sensitize MM cells
to the drugs, indicating that MAF exploits a common
pathway in both translocations and MEK would be
an additional drug target for above patients [42, 43].
Furthermore, +1q is found in 39% of newly diagnosed
MM and in almost 70% of MM patients harboring t(14;16)
or t(4:14) translocations, and has been associated with
adverse outcome even in intensively treated patients [33,
44, 45]. Studies have shown that the amplified region
in chromosome 1q carries the oncogenes PDZK1 [46]
and CKS1B [47]. PDZK1 was suggested to be involved
in MM cells resistance to several drugs, as its silencing
led to increased drug sensitivity. Surprisingly, PDZK1
was first identified through its interaction with several
proteins including MRP2 to make a functional cluster
involved in MDR phenotype in cancer cells [48, 49].
CKS1B has also been shown to promote MM cells growth
and proliferation [50], and to confer DR through MEK/
ERK and JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways [51]. On the
other hand, 1q21 deletion was also found a risk factor
independent of CKS1A amplification in MM patients [52].
Moreover, a group of researchers showed that t(4:14) and
t(11;14) translocations, which confer different clinical
outcomes, contribute to pathologic complications through

Impact of cytogenetic and epigenetic alterations
MM is universally recognized as having a high level
of genomic instability and a very complex cytogenetic
constitution which is displayed as changes in both
number and structure of various chromosomes [19, 20].
Notably, aberrant homologous recombination (HR) has
been identified as the main mechanism in MM genome
instability which increases overtime contributing to MM
aggressiveness and DR [20]. Based on karyotype changes
MM patients are placed in two groups: hyperdiploid
(HRD) which have 48-75 chromosomes (involving
mostly odd-numbered chromosomes 3,5,7,9,11,15,19,21)
and non-hyperdiploid (NHRD) which have less than
45 or more than 75 chromosomes and display IgH
translocations or chromosomal deletions such as del
(13) [21]. It has been suggested that only 10% of HRD
group show a primary IgH translocation at 14q32 locus
while it amounts to 70% in NHRD group [21], this might
partly explain the better survival and prognosis of HRD
group relative to NHRD group. The IgH translocation
usually involves juxtaposition of immunoglobulin gene
to an oncogene on partner chromosomes creating several
reciprocal translocations, including two more frequent
ones t(4;14)(p16;q32) in 15% and t(11;14)(q13;q32)
in 17% of MM patients [22]. Translocation t(4;14)
deranges at p16 locus the expression of FGFR3 which is
a proto-oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase, and multiple
myeloma SET domain (MMSET) which apparently has
methyl transferase function [23](readers are also referred
to ref. [24] for FGFR3 biologic function). Translocation
t(11;14) causes upregulation of cyclin D genes which play
key role in cell cycle. Of all chromosomal translocations
in MM, t(4:14)(p16;q32) has frequently been associated
with adverse outcome (and possibly resistance to
alkylating agents) in patients under high dose therapy
(HDT) modalities or ASCT, but t(11;14) usually confers
a favorable prognosis [25-29]. Of important note,
several studies confirm that including bortezomib in the
treatment regimen of patients with t(4:14) translocation
improves and even overcomes the risk factor [30-33].

different molecular mechanisms and that they share
only few mutated genes [53]. Finally, FGFR3 which is
overexpressed in t(4:14) translocation was demonstrated
to confer resistance to dexamethasone in MM cells [54],
and FGFR3 has been used as a drug target in t(4:14)positive MM cells [25, 55]. However, another group
reported that t(4:14) is by itself a risk factor conferring
poor drug response independent of FGFR3 expression
[25]. Hence, the extent to which above findings can
explain DR in relapsed / refractory MM patients with
above cytogenetic aberrations is not clear, with most
clinical studies suggesting associations (not causes and
effects). Nevertheless, gene expression profiling (GEP)
and whole genome sequencing (WES) technologies have
made possible the establishment of first portraits of gene
mutation spectrum and molecular categorization or risk
stratification of MM [23, 56-61]. One major goal of
these approaches is also finding any collaborative effect
of cytogenetic changes and gene mutations on adverse
clinical outcome, relapse or DR in MM. TP53 gene
mutations are rare in MM and basically occur at later
stages of the disease with strong association with therapy
resistance [62-65]. Loss of TP53 locus in MM has been
consistently associated with poor survival and resistance
to therapy, and with deregulation of various p53 target
genes [34, 66].
Recent investigations have unraveled substantial
contribution of epigenetic changes to hematologic
cancers progression and pathogenesis (reviews at [67,
68]). Epigenetic changes in human genome occur in two
common forms, DNA methylation and chromatin (histon)
modifications (acetylation and deacetylation). But much
to our surprise, recognition of abnormal DNA methylation
in human cancers has a long history [69]. Basically,
DNA methylations occur at CpG islands of promoters
influencing the expression of various genes which in
most cases are oncogenes controlling proliferation,
apoptosis, DNA repair and drug sensitivity of malignant
cells [70]. In spite of extensive investigations on genetic
and cytogenetic alterations in MM, our knowledge of the
mechanistic role (s) that epigenetic changes might play
in MM drug response is limited. Nonetheless, the role
of epigenetic markers in MM pathogenesis and MGUS
transition to overt MM is increasingly evidenced, with
frequency of some hypermethlyated genes being low
at early stages but increasing with MM progression.
Using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction
(MSP) most studies have detected hypermethylation of
such genes as p15, p16, p73 (cell cycle), DAPK, CASP8
(regulation of apoptosis), SOCS1 (cytokine signaling),
FHIT1 (tumor suppressor gene), O6-methylguanine DNA
methyl transferase or MGMT (DNA repair), TGFBR2
(growth factor receptor signaling) and e-cadherin (cell
adhesion) [71-79]. However, latest investigations on
MM epigenome using genome-wide methylation arrays

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

have yielded amazing findings shedding more light on
epigenetic changes contribution to MM progression and
partly DR [80-82]. In these studies, it is shown that the
methylation rate increases in transition from MGUS to
MM or from MM to plasma cell leukemia (PCL), and that
the global methylation pattern in normal B cells, normal
plasma cells and MGUS is explicitly hypomethylation.
More interestingly, they show that tumor suppressor
genes involved in drug response (TGFB1) and interaction
with bone marrow microenvironment (SPARC) are
hypermethylated and associated with a short OS [81].
In another recent study, researchers tried to find the
association between epigenetic changes and pattern of
response to bortezomib in relapsed MM patients. Using
DNA methylation PCR, they analyzed CpG island-related
DNA methylation profile of 30 genes in 75 relapsed MM
patients under bortezomib treatment. They detected a low
global methylation status in all patient samples and found
that patients with a higher global DNA methylation (more
than 3.95% of total DNA methylated) had higher overall
survival (OS) than patients with more unmethylated
DNA following bortezomib treatment. Furthermore, in
gene-specific methylation they found that patients with
lower frequency of methylated NFKB1 and CXCR4
genes had higher OS and progression free survival (PFS),
respectively. Also, lower global DNA methylation and
higher NFKB methylation pattern conferred a very short
OS after bortezomib treatment. Moreover, it has been
reported that hypermethylation in CDKN2A, CDKN2B,
TNF and RB genes is detected more frequently in
relapsed MM patients than newly diagnosed MM patients
[83]. Although, in above studies little focus is on the
functional and mechanistic aspect of epigenetic changes
to MM biology especially in terms of drug response,
they convincingly recognize some epigenetic markers as
promising drug targets. On the other hand, an association
of DNA methylation in MM with drug (dexamethasone)
resistance has only been reported in one study [84]. They
showed that hypermethylation of RASD1 gene in MM cells
was associated with resistance against dexamethasone and
treating the cells with 5’-aza-cytidine sensitized the cells
to the drug. Additionally, most of above gene methylations
have also been reported in acute lymphoid and myeloid
leukemias, and methylations of HIC1 and WIT1 were
associated with late stage AML and chemotherapy
resistant AML, respectively [12]. Indeed some epigenetic
markers are being considered as interesting drug targets
in hematologic malignancies [85]. It should be noted that
histone modifications also have known roles in cancer,
but we still don’t have sufficient evidence to support role
of chromatin changes in MM pathogenesis. However,
histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) alone or in
combination with chemotherapeutic drugs have always
shown profound anti-myeloma activities in both in vitro
and in vivo assessments [85-89]. Taken together, how

epigenetic changes in MM might affect drug response
of the patients and whether they play role in DR of MM
is not quite understood. One general inference from all
above studies could be, at least partially, involvement
by epigenetic changes of some pathways controlling cell
cycle and proliferation. This idea is rather supported by
the study at ref. [90]

resistance to drugs (bortezomib and doxorubicin), rapid
relapse and poor outcome in MM [105].
anti-apoptosis mechanisms
p53 tumor suppressor protein, known as” guardian
of genome”, performs an outstanding task in controlling
cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair, senescence and
autophagy [106-109]. p53 is inactivated in a variety
of human cancers, including in 10-12% of MM tumors
mostly due to loss of heterozygocity [110, 111]. In
many cancers, however, p53 inactivation could also
be the result of mutations in p53-DNA binding domain
or through overexpression of murine double minute 2
(MDM2) [108]. MDM2 is an E3-ubiquitin ligase which
binds p53 to ubiquitinate and target it for degradation
through ubiquitin/proteasome pathway [112], and is
overexpressed in 58% of MM samples which has been
frequently associated with chemoresistance [113, 114].
Of important note, MDM2 in many cancers remains
an oncogene even in the face of functional p53, and
overexpression of MDM2 in cell lines culminated in
resistance to vincristine, doxorubicin and etoposide (e.g.
see the ref. [115]). It has also been suggested that MDM2
imposes DR effects through increase in p53 degradation
or interaction with MDR1 gene [113]. Another tumor
suppressor p14ARF binds to MDM2 and sequesters
it in the nucleus to allow p53 stabilization [116]. The
regulatory loop p14ARF-MDM2-p53 plays substantial
role in cell fate in cases of cellular stresses such as DNA
damage (e.g. following chemotherapy) [116]. As happens
in MM cells [114], deletion/mutation in p53 or p14ARF
(loss of function) or upregulation of MDM2 would direct
the pathway toward deregulation of p53-related signaling
pathways and downstream targets (p21, GADD45, Bax,
Noxa, Puma), hence development of anti-apoptotic and
DR signals. Targeting p53 in MM has been considered as
an interesting treatment strategy based on mostly restoring
p53 function in MM cell lines and primary cells harboring
mutated p53. As a nongenotoxic approach, disruption of
p53-MDM2 interaction using nutlin-3 or RITA triggered
apoptosis in MM cells where synergistic effects with
bortezomib were also observed [117-121]. These studies
provided evidence that p53 protein and its pro-apoptotic
targets Bax, Puma and Bak were upregulated but antiapoptotic Bcl-2 was downregulated following above
therapeutic modulation. However, latter findings were
not evidenced in primary tumor cells from relapse or
refractory MM patients. A recent study demonstrated
that inhibition of ubiquitin-specific protease-7 (USP7),
which normally stabilizes MDM2, triggers apoptosis in
bortezomib-resistant MM cells, confirming the idea of
p53 downregulation as a DR mechanism in MM [122].
Involvement of p53 in apoptosis induced by nucleoside
analogs (gemicitabin and clofarabin) in MM cells was
also shown by another recent study [123]. Several

Role of deregulated signaling pathways
To elucidate the biological and biochemical
mechanisms underlying DR of MM cells, various
researches have been focused on signaling molecules,
scaffolds, complexes and mediators in a variety of
signaling pathways to reveal targets which could possibly
mediate DR following drug treatment. These signaling
pathways are mostly involved in two main DR-associated
mechanisms: aberrant drug transport, anti-apoptosis.
aberrant drug transport: MDR phenotype
Overexpression of P-gp, the product of MDR1
gene, has frequently been observed in MM and strongly
associated with relapse and DR [91-94]. Indeed, several
MDR modulators have already been applied to MM
clinical trials but were mostly associated with poor benefit
due to high toxicity [95-97]. Apparently, polymorphisms in
MDR1 gene (SNPs) will also influence therapy outcome,
for instance in MM patients under DAV protocol [98],
and variously detected in MGUS, MM and relapsed MM
tumor cells [99], however, their contribution to bortezomib
resistance is not clear [98, 100]. In contrast, a recent
study confirms that bortezomib functions as a substrate
for P-gp and overexpression of P-gp could underlie
bortezomib resistance [101], but this finding is apparently
not supported by other studies [18]. Surprisingly, another
recent study shows that overexpression of P-gp (ABCB1)
defines a subpopulation of MM cells which are resistant to
carflizomib, the newly FDA-approved second generation
proteasome inhibitor [102]. The major concern with MDR
markers is that they are weakly expressed at diagnosis but
overexpressed after chemotherapy, for instance, almost
6% of newly diagnosed MM patients but more than 43%
after chemotherapy (vincristine and doxorubicin) were
P-gp positive [94]. Moreover, it has been suggested that
following treatment with MDR modulators, tumor cells
could upregulate drug target proteins or create mutations
abrogating drug-target interaction [97]. The other MDRrelated protein, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP,
ABCG2), seems not to play role in MDR in MM [103], but
ABCG2 gene has been found methylatd and upregulated
following chemotherapy [104]. On the other hand, a new
study on MM cell biology and pathogenesis identified a
chromosomal instability (CIN) gene called NEK2 whose
overexpression upregulated MDR-related proteins, MDR1
(P-gp), MRP1 and BCRP and was strongly associated with

proteins have been described with their functions to be
p53-dependent, including RPRM (reprimo), a newly
identified candidate mediating cell cycle arrest by p53
[124]. Interestingly, reprimo gene has been reported to be
methylated in MM [125]. Two members of p53 family,
p63 and p73, bear high level of homology to p53 but their
contribution to MM pathogenesis, progression and therapy
outcome has not been fully investigated, however, p73
mutations and hypermethylations have been reported in
MM cells especially at advanced stages [74]. Furthermore,
one study demonstrated accumulation of p63, p73 and p53
in the nuclei of MM cells following drug-induced DNA
breaks [126]. Early growth response-1 (EGR1) gene
which functions in a p53-dependent manner [127, 128],
was shown to mediate JUN-induced apoptosis in MM
cells and be associated with poor outcome and DR when
downregulated [129]. All above studies highlight the key
role of p53 and its related proteins in MM pathogenesis
and drug response.
The transcription factor NFκB is a well-known
player in MM pathogenesis and biology in terms of
tumor cell proliferation, expansion and DR [1, 130,
131], and targeting NFκB pathway in MM (e.g. using
bortezomib) has recently improved MM therapy [1, 132].
The contribution of NFκB pathway to MM pathogenesis
is its constitutive activation in a large proportion of MM
tumor cells and HMCLs mostly due to ligand-dependent
activation, including effect of TNF-α, TRAIL, BAFF and
CD40L on MM cells inside the bone marrow [1]. The latter
cytokines are secreted by BMSCs and play critical roles in
MM clones maintenance and DR. However, it has recently
been discovered that mutations in some genes of NFκB
platform result in constitutive activation of NFκB pathway
making MM cells less dependent on BMME protection
and more refractory to chemotherapy [56, 133, 134]. These
findings create novel insights into role of NFκB pathway
activation in MM pathogenesis but cannot underscore
the contribution of extrinsic signals in BMME to NFκB
activation-related MM complications especially DR [135]
(and see discussion below). Intriguingly, it is also specified
that MM cells harboring TRAF3 gene mutation in NFκB
pathway are resistant to dexamethasone but sensitive to
bortezomib [133]. This is in line with fact that apoptotic
function of bortezomib is partly explained by blocking
canonical NFκB pathway; however, it unexpectedly
induces the alternative (non-canonical) pathway making
MM cells less responsive [136]. Moreover, in some cases
MM cells may develop a bortezomib-resistant NFκB
phenotype through a proteasome-inhibitor resistant (PIR)
pathway [137]. The latter flaws of bortezomib may explain
to a large extent why it should be applied in combined
regimens for those MM patients who are in relapse or
refractory to it. The transcription factor NFκB could also
contribute to DR in MM through upregulation of some
BCL-2 anti-apoptotic family members including BCL-XL
[138]. A variety of other molecules and signaling pathways
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

have been implicated in anti-apoptosis or DR mechanisms
of MM cells (table 1).

Role of bone marrow microenvironment
The role of BMME components especially BMSCs
and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein in the pathogenesis
of MM has been the focus of a good deal of research
and to our best knowledge contribution of BMME is
noteworthy (reviews at [1, 190, 191]. The fundamental
element in this performance is a well-established adhesion
between MM cells and BMSCs or fibronectin leading
to maintaining the growth, proliferation, invasion and
DR of MM clones and also promoting bone lesions and
angiogenesis. The best explained mechanisms of MM
drug/apoptosis resistance due to BMME effects in MM
are soluble factor-mediated drug resistance (SFM-DR)
and cell-adhesion mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR)
which are in fact two forms of environment-mediated
drug resistance (EMDR) in cancers [192]. SFM-DR can be
better explained by involvement of IL-6, the most critical
growth and survival factor for MM cells, and CAM-DR
is mediated by adhesion of MM cells to BMSCs or ECM
proteins involving adhesion molecules (β1 integrins).
However, other cytokines including HGF [193] and IGF1 [194] have also been implicated in MMDR. It was
shown that bortezomib-resistant myeloma cell lines and
clinical samples from bortezomib-refractory MM patients
displayed an activated IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling pathway
and a high level of IGF-1 cytokine which were associated
with bortezomib resistance. Blocking IGF-1R or IGF1 signaling alone or synergistically with bortezomib
increased MM cells death. Intrinsic (de novo) resistance
to drugs including bortezomib may occur in some MM
patients, which has been suggested to arise largely due to
CAM-DR (a transient form of DR only during cell-cell or
cell-ECM adhesion) and more importantly may contribute
to emergence of acquired DR in the course of treatment
[195]. The same concept has also been supported as an
underlying mechanism for de novo DR and minimal
residual disease in various cancers [192, 196]. Following
adhesion of MM cells to FN or BMSC, IL-6 is secreted by
BMSCs or by MM cells in an autocrine manner [197-199].
IL-6 is certainly the best studied cytokine critical to MM
cells, which has been implicated in MM cells resistance
to various apoptotic signals including Fas/Apo-1 and
chemotherapeutic drugs [200-202], with these responses
being possibly controlled through Jak/STAT signaling
pathway as was shown in U266 cell line [203]. It has also
been demonstrated in MM primary samples that MM cell
clones with autocrine IL-6 signal are more resistant to
dexamethasone than those with no autocrine IL-6 signal
[204]. Additionally, blocking IL-6 receptors with CNTO
328 increased sensitivity of MM cells to bortezomib [205].
These observations highlight the crucial role of IL-6 in
anti-apoptosis and DR mechanisms in MM.

Functional outcome

Refs.

Increase in growth, proliferation, DR, CAMDR and resistance to apoptosis mainly
through activated STAT3, NFκB, Akt and
MAPK pathways. Some HSPs (HSP27,
HSP70) are upregulated following treatment
of MM cells with proteasome inhibitors due
to induction of stress response inducing DR [139-147]
and HSP90 inhibitors show synergism with
bortezomib. In MM, HSPs can also stabilize
antiapoptotic BCL-2 members (BCL-2, MCL1 and BCL-XL), as HSP-90 inhibition in U266
cells resulted in significant apoptosis and
downregulation of above proteins.
The Notch1-jagg1 pathway is activated due
to MM cell-BMSC adhesion inducing CAMDR. Inhibition of Notch signaling by GSI
(γ-secretase inhibitor) induces MM cells
apoptosis through upregulation of Noxa. Dll1
/Notch pathway also promotes MM cells
resistance to bortezomib through upregulation
[148-154]
of of CYP1A1, a Cytochrome P450 enzyme.
Latter pathway is also constitutively activated
in MMCSCs (CD138- cells) which show more
resistance to drugs than CD138+ cells through
upregulation of BCL-2, MCL-1 and BCL-XL.
Notch pathway may contribute to MMDR
through MM cells-osteoclast interaction.

CAM-DR to doxorubicin, melphalan, vincristine,
bortezomib and mitoxantrone has been induced in MM
cell lines and patient primary cells through adhesion to FN
or BMSCs which was mostly mediated by VLA4 integrin
(α4β1) [206-209] and also through LFA-1 [210]. It should
be noted that other integrin molecules including β7 and
VLA5 (α5β1) could also play role in CAM-DR in MM
cells [207, 211]. More importantly, MM primary cells
with a higher expression of adhesion molecules (VLA4
and ICAM-1) are drug resistant and believed to be selected
by the chemotherapy during treatment tipping contribution
to acquired DR by CAM-DR [212]. Of note, acquired
DR is genetically much more complex than de novo DR
(CAM-DR) and indeed takes a long time to emerge. To
examine this idea, Hazlehurst et al. induced de novo DR
to melphalan in RPMI8226 cell line through adhesion
to FN and also in patient primary cells to confirm the
clinical relevance [213]. They then established an acquired
melphalan-resistant RPMI8226 subline (RPMI8226-LR5)
through long-time drug exposure. Using oligonucleotide
microarray, they detected change in the expression of
1479 genes in acquired DR model compared with only 69
genes in de novo DR parent line. These findings strongly
indicate that unlike acquired DR which is associated
with an outstanding transcriptome change, de novo DR
(CAM-DR) is mostly regulated by post transcriptional
mechanisms. Indeed, induction of β1-integrin mediated
CAM-DR in MM cells was characterized by G1 cell cycle
arrest accompanied by an increase in p27Kip1 protein level
and decrease in enzymatic activity of cyclin A and cyclin E
[208], upregulation of p21Cip1/Waf1 [149] or downregulation
of Bim (the apoptotic BCL-2 family member) [213]
implying involvement of posttranscriptional mechanisms.
Furthermore, adhesion through β1 integrin also induces
resistance to apoptotic signals such as Fas/Apo-1 in
various hematopoietic cancer cell lines including MM
with a post-transcriptionally regulated mechanism.
Observations in one study indicated that CAM-DR in
MM cells was associated with increase in solubility and
redistribution of c-FLIPL allowing its binding to and
inhibiting death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)
(which forms following CD95 ligation) and thus blocking
apoptosis [214].

SFM-DR as two separate systems is oversimplification,
because it is not unexpected to think that two processes
work hand in hand inside the bone marrow (figure 1).
In line with this, one study demonstrated the synergistic
anti-apoptosis resistance effect of adhesion to FN (β1
integrin signaling) and IL-6 (gp130 signaling) in MM cells
associated with activated STAT3 signaling pathway [199].
Moreover, treating MM cells with HGF increased their
adhesion to FN which was mediated by VLA4 integrin
and PI3K and NFκB pathways implying a synergistic
effect of FN-adhesion and HGF in promoting CAM-DR
of MM cells [193]. More interestingly, it is suggested that
SFM-DR and CAM-DR confer resistance to drug-induced
apoptosis in MM cells through distinct mechanisms [215].
However, in recent years many other studies have
been focused on deciphering molecular mechanisms
of drug/apoptosis resistance in MM conferred by bone
marrow stroma. Adhesion of MM cells to BMSCs induces
upegulation of Notch receptors on former cells which
bind to their specific ligands (Jagged) on latter cells
culminating in resistance to drug-induced apoptosis [149].
BMSCs were shown to induce bortezomib-resistant NFκB
activity in MM cells which was mediated by soluble
factors including IL-8 from BMSCs [216], providing
a supportive explanation to bortezomib resistance in a
large number of MM patients [137]. HSPs have also
been implicated in CAM-DR of MM, as adhesion of
MM cells to BMSCs and FN upregulated HSP-70 in
MM cells, and blocking HSP-70 resulted in increase in
melphalan-induced apoptosis and reversed CAM-DR
[144]. Co-culture of HMCLs (U266 and NCI-H929) with
MM patient BMSCs upregulated survivin in MM cells
conferring resistance against daunorubicin [217]. Notably,
blocking survivin had already been associated with growth
inhibition of MM cells and decrease in their resistance to
doxorubicin, melphalan and dexamethasone [218]. CD44
the receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA) mediated resistance
to lenalidomide in MM cells and lenalidomide-resistant
MM cells adhered more strongly to BMSCs and HA
implying a role for CD44 in CAM-DR of MM cells [219].
Upregulation of B7-H1 molecule on MM cells following
their adhesion to BMSCs was associated with resistance to
dexamethasone and melphalan in MM cells and increase
in Bcl-2 and FasL levels [220]. Of note, B7-H1 is also

considered as an immune response evasion tool expressed
on malignant plasma cells [221].
Some recent studies have also tried to understand
if chromosomal translocations and gene mutations might
control interaction of MM cells with BMME components
and hence trigger CAM-DR. Knock-down of the MMSET
protein in MM cells harboring t(4;14) led to decrease
in MM cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis
(activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9) and changed two
genes (DSG2 and ADAM9) involved in cell-cell adhesion
[222]. Although drug sensitivity of MMSET-silenced MM
cells was not examined in this study, their findings imply
a possible involvement of MMSET in controlling CAMDR of MM. Using whole exon sequencing (WES), another
study detected in MM patient samples and HMCLs
somatic mutations in adhesion molecules involved in
interaction with BMSCs giving an implication for role
of these mutations in CAM-DR, however; no functional
experiment was performed [223]. Mutations in some
oncogenes including RAS may also affect interaction of
MM cells with BMME and hence induce CAM-DR [188].
Furthermore, overexpression of c-MAF was detected in
50% of MM primary samples and also in HMCLs lacking
c-MAF translocations and was associated with increase in
ITGB7 (integrin β7) gene which is involved in adhesion

of MM cells to BMSCs and induction of CAMDR [211,
224].
It is interesting to remember that interaction of MM
cells with other cells in BMME could also determine
chemoresistance of in MM (figure 1). Osteoclasts confer
resistance to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in MM
cells through secretion of IL-6 and OPN (ostepontin)
form osteoclasts. These protective effects were largely
dependent on direct cell-cell contact [225]. Contribution
to chemoresistance has also been implicated by interaction
of MM cells with bone marrow endothelial cells, mainly
through induction of cytokines such as IL-6, SDF-1α,
MCP-1, Ang-1, bFGF and TNF-α by endothelial cells
[226]. Macrophages have been recently implicated in
chemoresistance in the context of MM bone marrow
environment. These cells also confer resistance to
apoptosis induced by dexamethasone and melphalan
through direct cell-cell contact and by hampering apoptotic
caspase pathway [227] and through adhesion molecules
PSGL1/selectins and ICAM-1/CD18 in in vitro and in vivo
(SCID mice) via Src, Erk1/2 kinases and c-myc pathways
[228]. Some research groups have put forward the role
of myeloma bone marrow hypoxia in disease progression
and chemoresistance [229]. The mainstay of this concept
is that MM bone marrow is more hypoxic than normal

Figure 1: SFM-DR and CAM-DR work usually together within the bone marrow environment. Adhesion of MM cells

to BMSCs and FN through integrin molecules triggers a variety of signaling pathways (including Ras/MAPK, PI3K/Akt, NFκB, Notch,
Wnt, HSPs) involved in cell proliferation, anti-apoptosis, DR and cytokine secretion (IL-6), and also upregulation of anti-apoptotic BCL-2
family members BCL-2, MCL-1 or BCL-XL. The above adhesion induces secretion of several cytokines (IL-6, VEGF, HGF, IGF-1, SDF1α, TNF-α, MCP-1) by BMSCs leading to triggering most of above pathways and induction of resistance to apoptosis and drugs in MM
cells (paracrine). IL-6 can also stimulate MM cells in an autocrine manner, although this system has been shown for some other cytokines
as well. Furthermore, most above cytokines may also be secreted by osteoclasts, endothelial cells and macrophages during their direct or
indirect interactions with MM cells leading to triggering of above functional responses in latter cells

bone marrow, and this leads to upregulation of HIF-1α and
HIF-2α which has been associated with suppression of p53
in some cancer cells, however; this association in MM is
not clear yet. Finally, the role of infectious / inflammatory
environment of MM cells in disease pathogenesis and DR
has recently become an interesting research focus. The
first clue of latter concept was expression by MM clinical
samples and HMCLs of a wide range of functional Tolllike receptors (TLRs) [230-232]. These molecules belong
to a family of pattern recognition receptors which control
and integrate immune responses and have been shown to
play multiple roles in cancer pathogenesis. Interestingly,
stimulating MM cells with some TLR ligands induced
secretion of IL-6, dexamethasone resistance, growth and
proliferation [231, 232], upregulation of immune evasion
markers [221], or differentially modulated expression
of adhesion molecules (α4, β7 and αVβ3) and adhesion
to FN [233]. On the other hand, stimulation of some
TLRs could also trigger apoptosis in some MM cells and
sensitize them to bortezomib in FN context [233]. Taken
all together, the role that BMME plays in pathogenesis
and chemoresistance of MM is undoubtedly vital, to the
extent that a plethora of experimental findings pinpoint
diverse cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in
this BMME-induced protective shield for MM clones.

model drug resistant MM cells were CD20+ [237], and
MMCSCs growth was inhibited by rituximab (anti-CD20
mAb), d)-MMCSCs (CD138- MM cells) are resistant to
dexamethasone, lanalidomide, bortezomib, are enriched in
a side population (SP) with high ALDH1 activity and drug
efflux pump [238], and recently e)-CD138- MM cells are
ALDH+, have a higher clonogenic potential than CD138+
cells and are able to expand tumor in NOG mice [239].
Several previous studies from Pilarski et al. also confirmed
presence of clonotypic B cells in MM patients contributing
to tumor expansion, relapse and DR [240-242]. On the
contrary, another group of researchers claimed that MM
initiating cells were enriched in the CD138-CD19-CD38++
component [243]. They showed that CD19+ MM cells
could not produce tumor colonies and engraft SCID-rab
mice, while these happened only with CD138-CD19CD38++, indicating that CD138- MM cells at least in some
MM patients are not B cells. Of striking importance,
MMCSCs express also functional markers such as drug
efflux pumps (ABCC3), ALDH1 and RARα2 which have
been associated with clonogenic potential and resistance
to chemotherapy further highlighting their contribution to
DR and relapse in MM patients [238, 244, 245]. It was
demonstrated that overexpression of RARα2 renders
MMCSCs (CD138- MM cells) drug resistant by activating
ABCC3 gene through stem cell related pathways Hh
(hedgehog) and Wnt. Indeed MMCSCs express mRNA
of Hh receptors which are normally involved in Hh
signaling and regulate homeostasis and biology of normal
stem cells [246]. Interestingly, Hh pathway was found
active in MMCSCs and blocking this pathway inhibited
clonal expansion and induced differentiation. However,
activation of this pathway was suggested to be mostly
ligand-dependent with BMSCs being the main source of
Hh ligands [247], and it can be speculated that interaction
of MMCSCs with BMSCs maintains activation of Hh
signaling and tumor dominance. Of note, inhibitors of
Hh pathway have already entered clinical trials in MM
[248]. Moreover, MMCSCs can also express telomerase
which has a prominent role in controlling normal stem cell
biology and cancer DR [249]. The inhibitor of telomerase
activity Imetelstat blocked MMCSCs clonogenic potential
in vitro and in vivo, triggered differentiation of CD138cells into CD138+ cells and decreased the number of
ALDH1+ cells. Taken all together, the above studies
provide strong evidence for existence of well-defined
stem/progenitor cells possessing the three prominent
features common to CSCs in all cancers: self-renewal,
proliferation and drug resistance.

MM cancer stem cell and DR
The bulk malignant cells in MM are plasma cells
expressing syndcan-1 (CD138), but this marker is
pertinent to terminally differentiated cells with limited
proliferative potential, and this for many years has led
researchers to explore real “MM-initiating cells” or MM
cancer stem cells (MMCSCs). Malignant plasma cells in
MM harbor somatically hypermutated immunoglobulin
genes remaining constant throughout the clinical course
of the disease and do not show intraclonal diversity
implying that MM arises from a post-germinal center
B cell having already experienced antigenic challenge
in lymph nodes. Generally speaking, the CSC model is
based on the concept that cancers constitute a hierarchical
organization like the hematopoietic system, suggesting
that CSC should maintain cancer cells population through
an asymmetric division (each CSC produces a daughter
and another CSC).
A convincing line of evidence confirms that MM
cells contain a rare subpopulation which is clonotypic
and drug resistant, expresses phenotypic markers of
memory B cell-like and possess stemness features [5, 234236]. It has been shown that: a)-only CD138- MM cells
have the clonogenic potential and are able to propagate
MM tumor in NOD/SCID mice, b)-MMCSCs carry the
immunophenotype signature CD138-/CD19+/CD20+/

to de novo or acquired DR, indicating that some patients
may become initially resistant to the drugs or develop
DR in the course of treatment. This will explicitly imply
that there still exist complexities in pathogenesis and
progression of MM warranting unstoppable research.
Nevertheless, identification of a variety of molecules and
signaling pathways with different levels of contribution
to MM pathogenesis has opened a new horizon to much
more targeted therapy than conventional cytotoxic
chemotherapy. For the most part, novel insights into role
of BMME components especially BMSCs and ECM
proteins in MM pathogenesis, progression and DR,
and also increased understanding of nature and role of
MMCSCs in tumor expansion and survival have provided
us with more promising therapeutic venues to target vital
pulses of MM through development of new agents.

formulations. Although emergence of new drugs has
revolutionized therapy for MM patients, almost all of them
finally develop relapse or DR. As discussed above, using
advanced genomics / oncogenomics a variety of factors
have been identified to play role in this refractoriness,
including various gene mutations, overexpression of
MDR genes, epigenetic changes and aberrant activation
of various pathways. Importantly, new proteasome
inhibitors (including Carfilzomib, ONX 0912, MLN
9708, Marizomib), HDAC inhibitors (e.g. Tipifarnib),
new IMiDs (Pomalidomide), kinase inhibitors (especially
inhibitors of mTOR and HSP90), new immune-based
therapies (antibodies against CS-1, CD38, IL-6) and new
alkylators (Bendamustine) have proved effective mostly
in combination with conventional drugs in phase I and
II clinical trials for MM patients who were bortezomibresistant or in relapse (for reviews see [40, 250, 251]).
However, development of DR in these contexts has
also been reported necessitating establishment of highly
specific targeted therapies. For instance, HSP90 inhibitors
prove to be effective with other drugs (including
bortezomib), but may induce upregulation of HSP-70 or
HSP-27 leading to DR and requires including the inhibitors
of latter HSPs [141, 252]. We now know that some genetic
alterations detected by oncogenomics with explained roles
in MM pathogenesis are also detected in MGUS indicating
their poor contribution to disease progression or possibly
DR. On the other hand, our knowledge of the role of
BMSCs or ECM proteins in MMDR (in terms of their
contribution to de novo or acquired DR), and of the nature
of MMCSCs has noticeably increased. Therefore, it is
expected that new drugs with the specific ability to target
these two elements of MM physiology be also developed
in order to eradicate MM initiating clones or decrease the
chance of DR or relapse. Interestingly, a recent thorough
investigation identified CD138- MM cell subsets harboring
Xbp1s- tumor B cells (plausibly MMCSCs) that were
bortezomib resistant and targeting latter population has
been suggested to be a promising target [253]. Xbp1s has a
critical function in B cell development and commitment to
plasma cells and is also an important element of unfolded
protein response (UPR) in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress-related apoptosis.
