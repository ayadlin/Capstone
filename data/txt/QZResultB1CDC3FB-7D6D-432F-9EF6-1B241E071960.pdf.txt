ABSTRACT
While combined chemotherapy (CT) with an autophagy inducer and an
autophagy inhibitor appears paradoxical, it may provide a more effective perturbation
of autophagy pathways. We used two dissimilar cell lines to test the hypothesis
that autophagy is the common denominator of cell fate after CT. HA22T cells are
characterized by CT-induced apoptosis and use autophagy to prevent cell death,
while Huh7.5.1 cells exhibit sustained autophagic morphology after CT. Combined
CT and rapamycin treatment resulted in a better combination index (CI) in Huh7.5.1
cells than combined CT and chloroquine, while the reverse was true in HA22T cells.
The combination of 3 drugs (triplet drug treatment) had the best CI. After triplet
drug treatment, HA22T cells switched from protective autophagy to mitochondrial
membrane permeabilization and endoplasmic reticulum stress response-induced
apoptosis, while Huh7.5.1 cells intensified autophagic lethality. Most importantly,
both cell lines showed activation of Akt after CT, while the triplet combination blocked
Akt activation through inhibition of phospholipid lipase D activity. This novel finding
warrants further investigation as a broad chemosensitization strategy.

of autophagy usually promotes apoptotic cell death [10].
Chloroquine (CQ), a commonly used autophagy inhibitor,
has been shown to reverse CT resistance in cultured
cells, animal models, and patients [11]. However, it is
still controversial whether CQ enhances the cytotoxic
effects of everolimus [12, 13]. It is also not clear whether
autophagy promotes or inhibits drug sensitivity. Current
data suggest that mTOR inhibition by everolimus should
increase the efficacy of CT or hormone therapy in breast
cancers [14, 15].
While cell lethality signals may go through an
autophagy process, “autophagic cell death” might be
a misnomer [16]. Autophagy can be activated as a
response to various stressors including CT. A completed
autophagy process includes autophagosome formation,
followed by autophagolysosome formation and

INTRODUCTION
Resistance to chemotherapeutics has become a
major obstacle in successful cancer treatment, and there
is an urgent need to develop novel treatment strategies
[1]. Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated catabolic
process, which aids in maintaining cellular homeostasis
and survival during exposure to extra- or intracellular
stresses through the degradation of targeted cytoplasmic
components [2, 3]. Autophagy is usually cytoprotective
when a cell experiences starvation or chemotherapy
(CT) [4–6]. However, autophagy can switch from a
cytoprotective to a cytotoxic role, depending on the
extent of autophagy, autophagy flux, and apoptosis
competence [7–9]. Apoptosis events are usually preceded
by autophagy-dependent survival signals, while inhibition

degradation of autophagolysosome content. A proficient
autophagy cell line may sustain autophagic morphology
to prevent apoptosis. Autophagy has been regarded as
a mediator of CT-induced cell death [17]. Inhibition
of autophagolysosome formation by CQ may activate
the unfolded protein response (UPR), an alternative
way of dealing with stress; or result in autophagosome
accumulation and necrotic death without UPR. The
inhibition of autophagy by CQ may induce a persistent
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) response and subsequent C/
EBP homologous protein (CHOP) expression, which is
potentially cytotoxic [18].
Both cytoprotective and cytotoxic autophagy can
activate the upstream phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mechanistic target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway to promote survival. CT may
activate Akt via second messenger pathways initiated by
hydrolysed membrane phospholipids [19]. Recent reports
have suggested a link between phospholipase D (PLD) and
Akt activity in a variety of cancers [20, 21]. Simultaneous
inhibition of the mTOR pathway and suppression of the
PI3K/Akt survival pathway during CT elicits a stronger
inhibition of cancer cells than CT alone [22].
The interesting theory of “battery operated tumor
growth” proposes that cancer cells induce an autophagy
state in the tumor microenvironment leading to the
increased production of recycled stromal nutrients to fuel
the anabolic cancer cells [23, 24]. A synergistic interaction
of autophagy inducers and inhibitors has been termed as
the “autophagy paradox” [25]. In a pilot study, we have
successfully tested the idea that triplet combination causes
sequential hits to cancers [26]. Here, we investigate the
underlying mechanisms of rapamycin (Rapa) and CQ
treatment under conditions of high ER stress induced
by vinca alkaloid [27] in both apoptosis-competent and
apoptosis resistant hepatoma cells. We conclude that
triplet drug combination not only inhibits the mTOR
pathway but also suppresses the activation of Akt prosurvival signals more than any of the doublet treatment
combinations (Rapa+V, CQ+V, and Rapa+CQ). Since
both drugs are clinically available and cheap, this triplet
treatment strategy may have broad clinical applicability.

Rapa at a molar ratio of 3:1 produced a synergistic effect
at the level of 30–70% inhibition of cell proliferation in
HA22T cells, with CI values of 0.661–0.976 and slight
antagonism (CI = 1.331) at 90% inhibition (Table 1). In
Huh7.5.1 cells, the CQ and Rapa combination at a molar
ratio of 3:1 had an additive effect (CI = 0.998) at 30%
inhibition and antagonism and CI values of 1.16, 1.47,
and 2.49 at 50%, 70%, and 90% inhibition, respectively.
Three-drug combinations of CQ, Rapa, and either
vinorelbine (6:2:1), docetaxel (6:2:1), cisplatin (3:1:1.6),
5-FU (3:1:500), or gemcitabine (3:1:500) were tested.
Greater cell growth suppression was achieved by the triplet
combination compared with the doublet combinations.
CIs suggested a synergistic effect at the level of 30–70%
inhibition for treatment with CQ and Rapa, plus vinorelbine
or docetaxel, in HA22T cells; a similar effect was observed
for Huh7.5.1 cells (Table 1). The combination of CQ,
Rapa, and vinorelbine produced the highest synergism and
was selected for further experiments (Table 1). As shown
in Figure 1A&1B, the triplet drug combination inhibited
cell proliferation in both cell lines (P < 0.05).

Triplet drug combination promoted autophagy
in Huh7.5.1 cells and apoptosis in HA22T cells
Because Rapa induces autophagy and CQ inhibits
autophagolysome formation, we examined how the
triplet drug combination affected patterns of cell death.
Triplet drug combination treatment elevated the level of
autophagy in comparison to the doublet combinations
(Rapa+V, CQ+V, or Rapa+CQ) in Huh7.5.1 cells (Figure
1C), and eventually induced marked autophagy and nonapoptotic cell death (Figure 1C&1G). In HA22T cells,
although CQ alone and doublet combinations (Rapa+V,
CQ+V, or Rapa+CQ) induced autophagy (Figure 1D), they
did not cause major cell death (Figure 1H). All doublet
combinations (Rapa+V, CQ+V, or Rapa+CQ) as well as
the triplet combination (Rapa+CQ+V) increased apoptotic
cell death in HA22T cells (Figure 1F). These results
indicate that co-administration of CQ and Rapa enhances
chemo-sensitivity in both cell lines, regardless of whether
it induces apoptosis or autophagy.
An efficient autophagy process includes
autophagosome formation and lysosome removal. Both
cell lines responded differently to vinorelbine, which
induced cytotoxic autophagy in Huh7.5.1 cells and
cytoprotective autophagy from HA22T cells. Huh7.5.1
cells are characterized by high autophagy flux and
proficient autophagy activity as indicated by no basal
microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain
3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3II) signal, a
low LC3II/cytosolic LC3 (LC3I) ratio, low nucleoporin 62
(p62) accumulation after mTOR inhibition by Rapa, and
accumulation of LC3II and p62 after lysosome inhibition
by CQ. In contrast, HA22T cells have less autophagy flux
as indicated by higher LC3II and p62 accumulation after

RESULTS
Triplet drug combination was more cytotoxic
than doublet drug combinations
Cell proliferation in two hepatoma cell lines,
Huh7.5.1 and HA22T, was evaluated after triplet
combination or doublet combination treatment. Several
ratios of CT agents, CQ, and Rapa were tested in order
to establish the optimal molar ratio of these three drugs.
Combination indices (CI) were calculated as described in
the Materials and Methods. The combination of CQ and

Rapa treatment (Figure 2A&2B). In HA22T cells, triplet
combination increased autophagy vesicular formation
without causing a switch to apoptosis. HA22T cells are
more apoptosis-prone, thus PARP cleavage occurred in
HA22T cells after either doublet or triplet treatment. Only
mild PARP cleavage of Huh7.5.1 cells was seen after
triplet treatment.

a strong and sustained ER stress response, as evident by
increased of GRP78 and CHOP expression after triplet
drug treatment. Huh7.5.1 cells showed no signs of an ER
stress response (Figure 3C&3D). These results show that
simultaneous inhibition of mTOR and Akt by the triplet
drug combination treatment overcomes chemo-resistance.
It has been reported that PLD activity is closely associated
with Akt activation [21]. Triplet combination reduced PLD
activity in both cell lines (Figure 4A&4B).

Basal metabolic phenotypes and adaptive
metabolic responses after triplet drug

The PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway plays a pivotal role
in apoptosis/survival signaling and is involved in chemoresistance [28]. Phosphorylated mTOR and its downstream
target kinase p70S6K were inhibited in both cell lines after
Rapa treatment. However, both cells displayed feedback
activation of phosphorylated Akt after Rapa treatment with
or without CT. Most importantly, both cells had decreased
levels of phosphorylated Akt after triplet drug treatment
(Figure 3A&3B). Huh7.5.1 cells also had Ras/Raf/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation
after Rapa treatment (Figure 3A). Sustained activation of
ERK has been shown to promote the death of many cancer
cell lines [29]. Nevertheless, HA22T cells had decreased
ERK activation after CT (Figure 3B). Instead, they had

To determine basal glycolytic activity and glycolytic
capacity, we measured extracelluar acidification rate
(ECAR) by consecutive injections of glucose, oligomycin,
and 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). Glycolytic activity and
capacity were 10% and 40% higher in HA22T cells
than Huh7.5.1 cells, respectively. The basal oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) and OCR capacity were 35%
and 60% lower in Huh7.5.1 cells as compared with
HA22T cells (Figure 5A&5B). This suggested that the
Huh7.5.1 cells are more dependent on glycolysis and
have a more efficient autophagy process to recycle energy

while HA22T cells adopt a more oxidative metabolism.
The addition of Rapa and CQ decreased basal ECAR and
OCR, as well as both capacities in both cells (data not
shown).
Hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) regulates
genes involved in glycolysis [30] and the proto-oncogene
c-Myc stimulates glutamine catabolism [31]. As shown in
Figure 5C&5D, HIF-1α was inhibited in Huh7.5.1 cells
after treatment with the triplet drug combination. HA22T
cells had increased c-Myc expression after vinorelbine
treatment and decreased expression after triplet drug
treatment. HA22T cells are prone to compensatory overexpression of c-Myc and increase both glycolysis and
mitochondrial activity after CT as an alternative energy
source; however, c-Myc expression was decreased after
triplet drug treatment. Dysfunctional autophagy impairs
glutamine metabolism and results in reduced intracellular
glutamate, decreased antioxidant intermediates, loss of

mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP), and
increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from
progressive mitochondrial damage [32, 33]. Glutamate
may activate mitochondrial matrix configuration and
decrease the loss of MMP [34]. Triplet drug treatment
decreased glucose uptake in Huh7.5.1 cells (Figure 6A),
intracellular glutamate levels in HA22T cells (Figure 6D),
and ATP in Huh7.5.1 cells (Figure 6E) as compared with
CT treatment alone. No difference in ATP was found in
HA22T cells (Figure 6F), but marked loss of MMP (Figure
6H) and ROS damage (Figure 6J) were observed.

NOD/SCID mice, but Huh7.5.1 cells were successfully
established. When tumor size reached 100 mm3, we started
intraperitoneal injections of CQ (50 mg/kg daily for 5
days), Rapa (50 mg/kg daily for 5 days), and vinorelbine
(5 mg/kg weekly), and made measurements of tumor sizes
every fourth day (6 tumors/group). As shown in Figure
7, the triplet drug combination treatment (Rapa+CQ+V)
more effectively inhibited tumor growth in the Huh7.5.1
xenograft than the doublet combination (Rapa+V, CQ+V
or Rapa+CQ).

autophagy. We also found that the triplet drug combination
overcame CT resistance by simultaneously decreasing
mTOR and Akt.
The combined induction and inhibition of autophagy
to activate cell death is an interesting idea in both cancer
cell and cancer-cancer associated fibroblast models [25].
Seront et al. reported a robust antitumor effect with
Rapa and CQ treatment for large hypoxic tumors, but
not small tumors in vivo [35]. Whether autophagy plays
a pro- or antitumorigenesis role depends on tissue type
and tumor developmental stage [36]. Autophagy usually
plays a pro-survival role in established tumors because
it acts as a mechanism to overcome the stress associated
with oncogenesis [37]. However, tumors with proficient
autophagy activity typically succumb to mTOR inhibition.
As seen in Figure 2A, Rapa treatment did not result in
accumulation of LC3II and p62 in Huh7.5.1 cells, but CQ
treatment caused high autophagy flux. High autophagy
flux, as reflected by high accumulation of LC3II and
p62 after CQ treatment, is usually regarded as a poor
prognostic factor and is associated with cancer progression
[38, 39].
The HA22T cells adopted a more mitochondria
oxidative metabolism and Huh7.5.1 a more glycolytic
metabolism. Triplet drug treatment decreased HIF-

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we have demonstrated that
simultaneous activation and inhibition of autophagy by
CQ and Rapa combination treatment is a novel therapeutic
strategy for CT sensitization. The chemosensitization
effect was achieved in both apoptosis-competent
(HA22T) and apoptosis resistant (Huh7.5.1) cells.
Increasing autophagy through CT and mTOR inhibition
by Rapa may or may not induce additive effects.
However, CQ combined with Rapa and CT, may either
switch cytoprotective autophagy to apoptosis or sustain

1α in Huh7.5.1 cells and subsequently decreased
glucose uptake. This result suggests that the triplet
drug combination is autophagy-dependent. Huh7.5.1
cells had less susceptibility to apoptosis but inefficient
mitochondria, which resulted in necroptosis. In contrast,
triplet drug combination also worked in apoptosiscompetent cells like HA22T, where protective autophagy
may be switched to mitochondria related apoptosis. c-Myc
was increased in HA22T cells after CT as a mechanism of
drug resistance. Hyperactive c-Myc activity orchestrates
cells’ response to metabolic demands including glucose
and glutamine uptake [40]. Glutamine is critical for
mitochondrial respiration [41] and depletion of glutamine
or glutaminolysis inhibition triggers an apoptotic response
in cells overexpressing c-Myc [42]. In c-Myc-inducible
cells, CT triggers glutamine dependence. Interestingly, CQ
has been reported to preferentially enhance the death of
c-Myc over-expressing cells [43], and is a potent inhibitor
of glutamate dehydrogenase [44].
We found that Huh7.5.1 cells had a high basal
expression of chaperone protein GRP78, which inhibits
apoptosis and stimulates pro-survival autophagy [45]. The
high basal GRP78 expression coincided with proficient
autophagy activity. Rapa treatment accelerated the
autophagic process with a decrease of GRP78 expression.

The addition of CQ induces defective autophagolysomal
formation and aborted autophagy may increase cell
death by necroptosis through p62 accumulation [46].
Interestingly, no ER stress response was noted after
doublet or triplet treatment in this particular cell. Since
ER homeostasis can be maintained without UPR response
(p-PERK, CHOP activation), sustained autophagy without
apoptosis was observed in Huh7.5.1 cells after triplet
treatment. Thus, chaperone-mediated ER stress could be
released by secretion of misfolded proteins outside of cells
after triplet treatment without activation of ER associated
protein degradation [47, 48].
In contrast, HA22T cells are apoptosis-competent
and CT induced both apoptosis and autophagy in these
cells. The addition of CQ to CT switched autophagy
into apoptosis through ER-mitochondria cross-talk
after autophagy blockage. Triplet drug treatment in
HA22T cells increased CHOP, loss of MMP, and
apoptosis without ERK activation. ER stress alone was
not sufficient to induce apoptosis, but simultaneous
inhibition of GRP78-dependent autophagy and canonical
autophagy by CQ led to ER-induced apoptosis [49]. The
triplet drug treatment caused higher levels of apoptosis
than any of the doublet combinations. Inhibition of
mTOR increases autophagy and abrogates its inhibitory

effect on the PI3K/Akt pathway, which in turn leads to
activation of Akt and increases cell survival [50]. CT
with or without Rapa resulted in Akt activation, but only
the triplet combination inhibited both mTOR and Akt
activation. It has been recently reported that CQ exerts
its anti-cancer effects partially through modification of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and overrides Rapa-induced
Akt-phosphorylation [51]. PLD hydrolyzes membrane
phospholipids to generate phosphatidic acid (PA). In turn,
PA activates Akt to mediate survival signals [21]. CQ has
been reported to inhibit PLD activity [52]. Triplet drug
combination decreased PLD activity, which might be the
most important rationale for the addition of CQ and Rapa
to a CT regimen.
Both cell lines had autophagy as a common
denominator but different stress response scenarios.
Sustained autophagy reaching capacity (by CT and Rapa)
followed by a blockage (by CQ) can cause toxic protein
aggregates to form. It is a strategy of synthetic lethality
that works in consecutive steps. The decrease of survival
signals results in either necrosis or in mitochondrial
damage through complex cross-talk among lysosomes,
mitochondria, and the ER [53]. Cell death is a highly
dynamic response that may manifest as a spectrum of
morphological overlaps [54], and is an area of intense
research. Rapa and CQ, apart from CT, exert only a
limited cytotoxic effect [55–57]. Although it was known
that autophagy could be modulated in this way, this is the
first report detailing the combined effects of CQ and Rapa
on chemosensitization. We have also translated this idea
into the clinic and were encouraged by the reversal of drug
resistance in some patients [26].

μL of CellTiter 96 aqueous one-solution was added to each
well. After 4 h of incubation, the UV absorbance of the
solution was measured at a wavelength of 490 nm. All
MTS assays were performed in triplicate.

Synergistic analysis
To evaluate the synergism between CQ, in
combination with Rapa, and various chemotherapeutic
drugs, the results from the cytotoxicity assays were
analyzed with CalcuSyn (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) using
the median-effect method, which is a well-established
procedure to quantitatively determine whether drug
combinations produce greater effects together than
expected from the simple summation of their individual
effects [60]. The combination index (CI) values obtained
from the data reflect the nature of the interaction between
different combinations; that is, values < 1 reflect
synergistic activity, values = 1 reflect additive activity, and
values > 1 reflect antagonism.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture

Apoptosis assay

Hepatoma cell lines HA22T and Huh7.5.1 were
maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen, Verviers, Belgium)
containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS),
2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/
mL streptomycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Huh7.5.1 is a
well differentiated hepatocyte derived cellular carcinoma
cell line that was originally taken from a liver tumor in
a 57-year-old Japanese male [58]. HA22T is a poorly
differentiated hepatoma cell line that was established from
hepatoma of a 50- to 60-year-old Chinese male [59].

Hepatoma cell lines were cultured and trypsinized,
as described above, and washed twice with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS). Apoptosis was assayed using an
Annexin V Apoptosis Kit (BD Pharmingen, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
tumor cells were washed three times with PBS, and then
cells were analyzed immediately for apoptosis using
Annexin V/PI (propidium iodide) staining. Washed cells
were supplemented with 1% BSA and then stained directly
with 10 μL of PI and 2.5 μL Annexin V-FITC, after the
addition of 222.5 μL of binding buffer. Immediately
following a 10 min incubation in the dark on ice, the
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage
of positive cells was determined using a FACSCalibur
cytometer and Cell Quest Pro software (Becton Dickinson,
Mountain View, CA).

Drugs and chemicals
Cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), vinorelbine,
docetaxel, and gemcitabine were obtained from Sigma
and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Cell
culture reagents and consumables were obtained from

the PLD activity of the samples.

Huh7.5.1 and HA22T cells were collected in
FACS tubes (BD Biosciences Discovery Labware, MA,
USA) and resuspended in PBS. The cell suspension was
stained with acridine orange (5 μg/ml) for 15 min at room
temperature (RT). The cells were washed twice with PBS,
resuspended in PBS, and analyzed using flow cytometry
and Cell-Quest software. The experiment was performed
three times.

Intracellular glutamate assay
Intracellular glutamate concentrations were
measured using a Glutamate Assay Kit (BioVision)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 1 x
106 cells were washed with PBS and lysed in glutamate
assay buffer. The samples or standard (50 μL per well)
and reaction mix (50 μL per well) were each added to a
96-well plate. After 30 min incubation, absorbance was
measured at 450 nm using a microplate spectrophotometer
(Multiskan FC, Thermo Scientific, MA, USA).

Western blots
Cells were lysed for 5 min at RT in a buffer composed
of 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mM EDTA, 1%
(v/v) Nonidet p-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
20 μg/mL aprotinin, and 25 μg/mL leupeptin (Sigma).
The total protein concentration of lysates was measured
using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). Cell lysate (100 μg) was electrophoresed on a 12%
polyacrylamide gel and the proteins were transferred to
an Immobilon-P PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford,
MA), which was then blocked for 2 h at RT in PBS
containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 10% nonfat milk. The
membrane was then incubated with antibodies against
GAPDH (Sigma), HIF-1alpha, LC3 (Novus Biologicals
Inc., Littleton, CO), c-MYC, SQSTM1/p62, PARP,
phospho-mTOR, phospho-Akt (Ser 473), phosphop70S6K, GRP78, phospo-ERK1/2, phospho-PERK,
CHOP antibody, (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly,
CA), Glutamine synthetase (GS) (Abcam Inc., Cambridge,
MA, USA) for 2 h at RT in PBS containing 0.05% Tween
20 and 5% nonfat milk, followed by incubation for 1 h
at RT with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West
Grove, PA) in the same buffer. Blots were developed using
a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL; GE Life
Science, Buckinghamshire, UK).

Intracellular ATP assay
The intracellular ATP concentrations were measured
using an ATP colorimetric/fluorometric Assay Kit
(BioVision) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, 1 x 106 cells were washed with PBS and lysed
in ATP assay buffer. The samples or standard (50 μL per
well) and reaction mix (50 μL per well) were each added
to a 96-well plate. After 30 min incubation, absorbance
was measured at 570 nm using a Multiskan FC microplate
photometer (Thermo Scientific).

Determination of mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP)
MMP were measured using a BD MitoScreen kit
(JC-1, BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were washed and
resuspended in 500 μL of JC-1 working solution. Cells
were incubated at 37°C for 15 min. Following staining,
cells were washed twice and resuspended in 500 μL of
assay buffer. Cells were immediately analyzed using a BD
FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Live cells were gated and
analyzed.

Glucose uptake assay

Measurement of ROS production

For glucose uptake, 1.5 × 105 cells were stained with
the fluorescent D-glucose analogue 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2 -deoxyglucose (2-NBDG;
20 μM; Invitrogen) for 1 h, washed with PBS, and
analyzed by using a FACSCalibur cytometer and Cell
Quest Pro software.

Intracellular ROS was detected by 2',
7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA, Sigma). Cells
were washed with PBS and incubated with DCFDA (0.25
μM) for 10 min at 37°C. The florescence intensity was
detected using FACSCalibur cytometer and Cell Quest Pro
software. Untreated cells were used for normalization.

Phospholipid lipase D activity assay

Huh7.5.1 hepatoma xenograft model

PLD activity was measured using a PLD activity
colorimetric assay kit (BioVision) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 5 x 105 cells were
washed with PBS and were lysed in PLD Assay Buffer.
The samples or standard (50 μL per well) and reaction
mix (50 μL per well) were each added to a 96-well plate.

concentration of 5 × 107 cells/mL before subcutaneous
implantation into mice. Male NOD/SCID mice, 6-wkold, were injected with 5 × 106 cells into the right flank
using a 27-gauge needle in a 1 mL tuberculin syringe.
Approximately 12 d later, when the tumors reached ~4 × 4
mm in diameter, mice were randomly assigned to specific
treatment groups. The longest (a) and widest perpendicular
(b) tumor diameters were measured at regular intervals
using a caliper. Tumor volume was calculated using the
formula V = 1/2 a2b. All animals were sacrificed on day
35 following treatment. The animal use protocol was
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) in Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su
Memorial Hospital.

Metabolic responses of Huh7.5.1 and HA22T
cells were evaluated with an Extracellular Flux Analyzer
(XFe24; Seahorse Biosciences, North Billerica, MA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
Extracellular Flux Analyzer allows for analyzing oxygen
consumption and ECARs of a defined number of cells
in a defined small volume of culture media in real time
and for monitoring their response to drug treatment. In
briefly, cells were seeded 5 x 104 in XFe24-well plates and
incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere
for overnight, followed by treatment with indicated
drug concentrations for 2 h. After 2 h, the mitochondrial
respiration was detected by oxygen consumption rate
(OCR) and glycolysis was evaluated by extracelluar
acidification rate (ECAR) after injecting the following
inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration by oligomycin
(inhibitor of ATP synthase, 1uM), FCCP (uncoupling
factor), antimycin A/rotenone (inhibitor of mitochondrial
complex I of the ETC), and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG;
inhibitor of hexokinase). Basal OCR and ECAR were
measured, as well as the changes in oxygen consumption
caused by the addition of the metabolic inhibitors
described above.
