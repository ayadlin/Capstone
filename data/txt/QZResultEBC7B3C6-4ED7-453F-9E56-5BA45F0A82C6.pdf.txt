BACKGROUND: African American race and uninsurance are associated with undertreatment and poor survival in solid
tumor cancers. This relationship has not been examined in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) where absence of treatment or treatment delays can result in death within weeks or months. Induction followed by consolidation treatment,
in contrast, has a high probability for remission or cure. We examined the relationship between race and health insurance and inpatient chemotherapy and survival in AML patients between the ages of 21 and 64 years. We also examined inpatient costs associated with inpatient treatment. METHODS: We used population-based data from the
Virginia Cancer Registry and the Virginia Health Information discharge data for patients diagnosed with AML
between 1999 and 2006 (n ¼ 523). Adjusted logistic regression was used to measure the relationship between the independent variables and chemotherapy. We used the Cox proportional hazards method to estimate survival.
RESULTS: Uninsured patients were more likely to be untreated than their privately insured counterparts (odds ratio,
4.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-10.49) and had a higher likelihood of death (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence
interval, 1.02-1.84). Once treatment was adjusted in the survival analyses, differences between insurance groups were
not statistically significant. The median 1-year cost of inpatient care following diagnosis for patients who received
chemotherapy exceeded $100,000. CONCLUSION: This study addressed the urgency for health insurance that
affords access to care. Without treatment, the outcome of AML is death within only a few months; with treatment,

KEYWORDS: acute myeloid leukemia, health insurance, race, disparities, costs, and survival.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological malignancy that accounts for approximately 13,300 of all new cancer cases per year.1 The incidence of AML increases with age, but often the elderly are unable to tolerate high-dose cytotoxic regimens of chemotherapy.2 Poor performance status and comorbid conditions make these patients poor candidates
for treatment,3 and even when tolerated, chemotherapy may not benefit patients 70 years of age.4 Younger patients, in
contrast, are usually able to tolerate intensive chemotherapeutic treatment regimens. Recommended treatment includes
both inpatient induction and consolidation therapy.3 These treatments are given in an inpatient setting and can require
long stays in the hospital. However, if successful, 70%-80% of patients <60 years of age enter complete remission.5 With
induction and consolidation therapy, 40%-45% of patients will be cured.5 In contrast to many solid tumor cancers (with
the exception of those in late stage), without treatment, AML usually results in death within a few months after diagnosis.5
Published studies have not examined the influence of health insurance source and race on AML treatment and survival in adults <65 years of age. Across many solid tumor cancer sites, African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed
at later stages, have poorer survival,6 and are less likely to receive adequate treatment.7-11 Likewise, lack of health insurance
is associated with lack of cancer-directed treatment,12,13 although this relationship has not been demonstrated in patients
with AML, in whom disease progression is certain and in the absence of treatment, prognosis is almost always death. Limited population-based data are available on younger and uninsured patients because they are not eligible for Medicare and
are thus not included in large medical claims databases such as SEER-Medicare.14 Using a statewide, population-based
dataset, we examined the probability that young adult (ages 21-64 years) AML patients are treated with chemotherapy.
We contrasted the experience of privately insured patients with that of uninsured and publicly insured patients (defined as
Medicare or Medicaid), controlling for socioeconomic status along with other demographic characteristics. We also examined the influence of race on the probability that a patient receives chemotherapy. We then compared the probability of

survival for patients across different categories of insurance, including being uninsured. Finally, we estimated
the costs of inpatient care 1 year following AML diagnosis. Costs were examined to inform hypotheses about the
relationship between the cost of care and the probability
of treatment, particularly for uninsured patients. These
hypotheses could not be tested in this study, but are left
for future research.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient data came from 2 statewide sources: the Virginia
Cancer Registry (VCR) and the Virginia Health Information (VHI) discharge data. The VCR, which is population-based and North American Association of Central
Cancer Registries accredited, was the source for the AML
sample. The VCR contained data on patient demographic
characteristics, cancer site, diagnosis date, first course
treatment, primary health insurer, and patient address,
including geocoded coordinates that could be linked to
census tracts. The study was approved by the institutional
review boards at Virginia Commonwealth University and
the Virginia Department of Health.
Inpatient treatment information was extracted from
the VHI discharge database, which contained discharge
abstracts on all Virginia hospital admissions that exceeded
23 hours. Discharge abstracts included patient information, International Classification of Diseases version 9
(ICD-9) diagnosis and procedure codes, payer information, dates of admission and discharge, and charge information. Information was available on all types of
discharges—not just those related to the treatment of cancer. However, because these patients were young and
most likely healthy, few had inpatient admissions prior to
diagnosis.
We linked the VCR and VHI data using deterministic and probabilistic matching techniques. Both datasets
contained Social Security Number (SSN), date of birth,
sex, and ZIP code. To evaluate and assess the possible
matches returned from these efforts, we compared the
level of agreement for each data element involved in
matching. For example, for each possible matched VHI
record, we determined the number of SSN digits that
matched (from 0 to 9) the difference in month, day, and
year components of the date of birth and whether there
was a match on sex and ZIP code to those elements on the
VCR record. Among the matched records for AML
patients, 92% matched exactly on SSN, date of birth, and
sex.

Study Sample
The number of newly diagnosed AML patients aged 2164 years, diagnosed between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2006, and who had no prior history of cancer
was 539. To assign health insurance to a patient, we used
the payer listed in the VHI hospital discharge data for
inpatient chemotherapy treatment; for patients who did
not receive inpatient chemotherapy, we used the payer
listed in the VCR. Payers were categorized into the following groups: Medicaid, Medicare, private or military, other
government (eg, local county plan), uninsured, and
unknown. We removed patients with unknown, Veterans
Administration or other government insurance from the
sample (n ¼ 16 [3.1%]) for a total sample size of 523.
Race was categorized as white, African American, or
Other using data from the cancer registry.
Outcomes
The outcomes of interest were absence of inpatient chemotherapy, survival, and inpatient costs of treatment 1 year
after diagnosis. Inpatient chemotherapy was primarily
determined from VHI claims (n ¼ 416 [86%]). An additional 69 (14%) patients were identified from the VCR,
but did not have a corresponding claim in the VHI database. We combined information from both sources to
minimize possible undercounting of patients who may
have gone out of state for treatment and thus would not
have a claim in the VHI database. Nonetheless, we believe
these patients were treated in an inpatient setting, because
it is unlikely that many patients in this younger age group
would receive chemotherapy in an outpatient setting.
Low-dose outpatient chemotherapy is almost exclusively
reserved for older patients and those whose acute leukemia
followed myelodysplasia or is secondary to previous
chemotherapy.15,16
We verified patients’ dates of death with the Social
Security Death Index through September 30, 2010.
Therefore, we had nearly 4 years of survival data, at a minimum, on all patients in the sample. Death was measured
as all-cause mortality.
Inpatient costs were estimated using inpatient
charges reported in the VHI discharge data. All patients
were included in this analysis, including those that died
within 1 year of diagnosis (n ¼ 146). To calculate the
cost/charge ratio for each hospital, we divided each hospital’s total inpatient and outpatient operating expenses by
its inpatient and outpatient charges. Separate hospitalspecific cost/charge ratios were estimated for each year
during the study period. We converted charges to costs by

4773

Original Article

multiplying charges by the hospital-specific cost/charge
ratio for the year in which the inpatient visit occurred.
Costs were then adjusted for inflation using the Medical
Consumer Price Index for the Washington–Baltimore,
Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, West Virginia17 area over the period 1999 to 2006 to adjust the
costs to the year 2006.

Control Variables
We controlled for patient sex and age in all models. Age at
the time of diagnosis was entered into the model as a continuous variable. In the analysis of survival time from diagnosis to death, we added a dichotomous variable
indicating whether the patient had received inpatient
chemotherapy.
Other researchers have noted that socioeconomic
characteristics can confound the correlation between
uninsurance and public insurance and poor cancer outcomes.6 In addition, socioeconomic status was shown to
be associated with poor AML survival in a cohort of
patients in Sweden18 and in the United Kingdom,19
where health insurance is nearly universal. Therefore, we
included ecological measures of socioeconomic status in
our analysis. Using a method developed by Diez Roux et
al,20 we constructed a summary measure of socioeconomic status for each census tract code in Virginia using
data on income, education, and occupation from the
2000 US Census and linked this information to patients’
census tract code of residence. Six census variables were
used, 3 measures of household wealth and income (median household income; median value of housing units;
proportion of households with interest, dividend, or
rental income), 2 education variables (proportion of adult
residents completing high school; proportion of adult residents completing college), and 1 variable regarding occupational status (proportion of employed residents with
management, professional, and related occupations).
The mean and standard deviations were calculated
for each of the 6 variables in all Virginia census tracts.21 A
z-score was constructed for each census tract code by subtracting the mean of all Virginia census tracts and dividing
by the standard deviation. The summary measure was the
summation of the 6 z-scores and ranged from 12.2 to
17.5. To facilitate interpretation, we standardized summary scores by converting them into a 0-100 scale (0,
greatest socioeconomic disadvantage; 100, greatest socioeconomic advantage).

Statistical Analysis
We described the characteristics of all AML patients by
health insurance source and used chi-square and Fisher
exact tests to determine statistical differences between the
samples. We used t tests to determine the statistical significance between means in continuous variables. KruskalWallis tests were used to determine statistical significance
between medians in continuous variables. Adjusted logistic regression was used to measure the relationship
between the independent variables and the absence of
inpatient chemotherapy. We estimated 2 models—one
without insurance status and another with insurance status—to demonstrate how insurance coverage alters the
effect of race on treatment. We reported odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and P values.
Because the absence of chemotherapy has a low prevalence
in our sample, the OR closely approximated the relative
risks (results not shown). P values were derived from likelihood ratio tests and are 2-sided. We estimated the median length of stay and inpatient costs descriptively.
For survival analyses involving adjustments for confounding factors, we used the Cox proportional hazards
method. We estimated proportional hazards models with
and without chemotherapy. The proportional hazard
assumption was tested by including time-dependent covariates (created as the interactions of the main effects with
the logarithmic transformation of time) in the Cox regression model. This method is equivalent to testing for a
non-zero slope in a generalized linear regression of the
scaled Schoenfeld residuals on functions of time. All analyses were conducted using SAS/STAT version 9.2 for
Windows.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Table 1 reports the sample characteristics by health insurance source and for the overall sample. There were fewer
privately insured African Americans (13%) relative to
other insurance groups. Slightly more females were
insured by Medicare or Medicaid (56%) relative to other
groups. Patient age was comparable across insurance
groups, although uninsured patients were slightly
younger, but not statistically significantly so, relative to
other patients. The average socioeconomic status score for
census tracts where Medicare- and Medicaid-insured
patients resided was statistically significantly lower relative
to the score for privately insured patients (37.61 vs
44.55). The average socioeconomic status score for census

Nearly all privately insured patients received inpatient chemotherapy (94%). In contrast, 19% of uninsured
patients did not receive inpatient chemotherapy and 10%
of publicly insured patients did not receive inpatient
chemotherapy. Patients insured by Medicaid or Medicare
had fewer survival months than uninsured and privately
insured patients (11.10 months, 16.37 months, 21.23
months, respectively). We noted 2 extraordinary outliers
in the uninsured group. When we excluded these patients

from the sample, the upper CI for uninsured patients
decreased from 57 months to 37 months.

Chemotherapy and Survival

chemotherapy and the likelihood of death. In estimations
without insurance source, African Americans were more
likely to forgo inpatient chemotherapy, but the OR was
only marginally statistically significant (OR, 2.33; 95%
CI, 0.97-5.57; P ¼ .06). In the full model that includes
insurance status, uninsured patients were 4 times more

Original Article

likely to forgo inpatient chemotherapy as privately insured
patients (OR, 4.40; 95% CI, 1.85-10.49).
Insurance source was a statistically significant predictor of the likelihood of death in models that did not
include the receipt of chemotherapy. Uninsured patients
had a higher hazard ratio (HR) than privately insured
patients (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.02-1.84). Publicly insured
patients were also more likely to die during the study period relative to privately insured patients (HR, 1.39; 95%
CI, 1.02-1.88). Older age was associated with a slightly
higher likelihood of death (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.021.04). African Americans had a higher likelihood of death
relative to white patients (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05-1.94).
In the model that included receipt of chemotherapy,
patients who received chemotherapy had a much lower
likelihood of death (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.24-0.54), and
the HRs for health insurance and race were no longer statistically significant.
Cost of Care
If patients are faced with large out-of-pocket expenses,
they may be less inclined to seek treatment or more
inclined to delay treatment, particularly if the treatment
involves long and costly inpatient stays. In our sample, the

Figure 1. Median inpatient costs 1 year after acute myeloid
leukemia diagnosis are shown.

greatest median costs for inpatient treatment occurred
during the first 2 quarters following initial diagnosis
(approximately $80,000 and $20,000 for all patients in
the first and second quarters, respectively). For patients
that did not survive the year, median costs spiked in the
third quarter to approximately $25,000. During the final
quarter of the year after diagnosis, inpatient costs
decreased substantially and approach zero (Figure 1).
In an analysis stratified by insurance type, the median inpatient cost of care 1 year after diagnosis was
approximately $123,000 for privately insured patients
and approximately $130,000 for publicly insured patients
(Table 3). Uninsured patients, in contrast, had inpatient
median costs that were considerably lower (approximately
$100,000). These patients had shorter lengths of stay in
the hospital (3 and 10 days fewer relative to privately and
publicly insured patients, respectively). They also had
fewer readmissions within 30 days of discharge and fewer
retreatments defined as a readmission for chemotherapy
within 120 days after the initial chemotherapy treatment
discharge from the hospital.

DISCUSSION
The prognosis of patients with untreated AML is certain:
death usually occurs within a few months. If left
untreated, AML typically leads to death within weeks to
months of its clinical presentation.22 With treatment, particularly in younger adult patients, the prognosis includes
a high likelihood of remission and a chance for cure.
Uninsured patients were less likely to receive chemotherapy than their privately insured counterparts. Racial differences were present in survival analyses that excluded
chemotherapy. In these analyses, African Americans had a
greater likelihood of death. Once chemotherapy was
added to the estimation, both racial and insurance differences were no longer statistically significant. These findings point to the critical role of health insurance in AML,

a life-threatening disease that is expensive to treat. In a
separate analysis, approximately one-third of uninsured
AML patients died within 2 months after diagnosis
(results not shown), a finding that underscores the importance of health insurance in preventing death in patients
with a potentially curable disease. Publicly insured
patients—a group that was demographically similar, but
lived in lower income areas—were not statistically different from privately insured patients in their probability of
receiving chemotherapy, although they experienced a
slightly higher and statistically significant probability of
death (HR, 1.03; P < .05).
The reasons why uninsured patients are less likely to
receive chemotherapy are many. We hypothesize that 1
reason may, in part, be due to cost and perhaps delay and
reluctance to receive medical consultation for AML symptoms. If patients bear the full cost of inpatient treatment,
they will pay $100,000 or more; these costs occurred even
for those patients who died within a short period. If hospitals and physicians economize on length of stay and subsequent treatment such as consolidation therapy for the
uninsured, costs are still exorbitant. Assuming that
patients do not bear the full cost of care, the treating hospital must agree to absorb costs of care or in the case of
publicly insured patients, accept lower reimbursement
rates. The remaining out of pocket payments for patients
may still be beyond what patients and their families can
pay. Other reasons related to the absence of chemotherapy
may be due to patient health status and comorbid conditions. Patients who present late in the disease course or
with conditions such as infection or severe bleeding may
not be able to tolerate chemotherapy, or if chemotherapy
is initiated, they may not survive treatment. Uninsured
patients may also have neglected conditions such as diabetes or coronary heart disease that are counterindications
for intensive treatment.3 However, the fact that Medicare
and Medicaid patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy than uninsured patients casts doubt on arguments
regarding differences in health status.
This study has several limitations. First, the data were
confined to a single state and may not be generalized to
other regions of the country. Nonetheless, the data were
population-based, a considerable strength, and there is no
apparent reason why chemotherapy and survival rates
would differ in Virginia during the 7-year study period relative to rates observed in other states. Second, the data were
specific to inpatient treatment. Information on supportive
care, outpatient treatment, and physician services was not
available. Differences in outpatient treatment may have

Cancer

October 15, 2011

contributed to or lessened the differences observed in this
study. Third, it is possible that some patients were incorrectly misclassified as not having treatment when they in
fact received treatment out of state. The effect of misclassification would bias survival analyses toward the null hypothesis, lending greater confidence to the statistically
significant results we observed. We suspect that inpatient
chemotherapy misclassification is low in our sample,
because the patients who are least likely to have chemotherapy—namely the uninsured and publicly insured—are also
the least likely to travel out of state for treatment. Lastly, information on patient health status, functional status, cytogenetics, and comorbid conditions from outpatient data
were not available. Only a few patients had inpatient
admissions before cancer diagnosis, which suggests that the
severity of comorbid conditions, if present, may have been
low. Each of these factors could be correlated with insurance status and the outcomes of interest.
In spite of these limitations, the study found statistically significant associations between insurance status and
receipt of inpatient treatment and survival. The study also
filled an important gap in the literature by providing information relevant to adult AML patients <65 years of
age. It confirmed that findings from other published studies regarding uninsurance and treatment and survival in
other cancer sites also apply to patients with AML, but the
consequences associated with the absence of treatment in
AML are much more immediate and dire.
We hypothesize that the relationship between insurance and lack of treatment may be related to the cost of
treatment. In a study published in 2006,23 researchers
found that the mean inpatient charges for the initial hospitalization were $113,118 for patients who received
chemotherapy and $43,999 for patients who did not
receive chemotherapy. The estimated costs in our study
were similar. Although we could not directly test hypotheses related to high cost of care and absence of treatment in
the uninsured in this study, we nonetheless concluded
that as costs continue to rise, disparities between insurance
groups may widen.
This study’s findings suggest that there are opportunities to develop policies that can influence improvements
in AML survival among adult patients <65 years of age.
Although its final form is yet to be defined, implementation of the Affordable Care Act is likely to result in fewer
uninsured patients, and these patients may have easier
access to expensive inpatient treatments. However, we recognize that these patients may also have conditions that
are counterindications for treatment, and that these

4777

Original Article

conditions may be related to uninsurance. Further
research (eg, a detailed review of medical records) is
needed to understand the complex relationship between
health insurance and the receipt of inpatient chemotherapy and survival for AML patients <65 years of age.
Unlike findings in other studies of solid tumor patients
and their insurance source, this study points to the urgency for health insurance that affords access to care.
Without treatment, the outcome of AML is surely death
within only a few months; with treatment, the chance for
long-term remission or even cure exists. Few diseases are
as time-sensitive to treatment as AML, and until more
affordable care is available, many uninsured AML patients
may not receive the care they need.
