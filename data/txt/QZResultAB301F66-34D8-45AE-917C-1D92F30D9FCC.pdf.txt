ABSTRACT:
Diffuse Large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) are the most prevalent of the non-Hodgkin
lymphomas and are currently initially treated fairly successfully, but frequently
relapse as refractory disease, resulting in poor salvage therapy options and short
survival. The greatest challenge in improving survival of DLBCL patients is overcoming
chemo-resistance, whose basis is poorly understood. Among the potential mediators
of DLBCL chemo-resistance is the thioredxoin (Trx) family, primarily because Trx
family members play critical roles in the regulation of cellular redox homeostasis, and
recent studies have indicated that dysregulated redox homeostasis also plays a key
role in chemoresistance. In this study, we showed that most of the DLBCL-derived cell
lines and primary DLBCL cells express higher basal levels of Trx-1 than normal B cells
and that Trx-1 expression level is associated with decreased patients survival. Our
functional studies showed that inhibition of Trx-1 by small interfering RNA or a Trx-1
inhibitor (PX-12) inhibited DLBCL cell growth, clonogenicity, and also sensitized DLBCL
cells to doxorubicin-induced cell growth inhibition in vitro. These results indicate
that Trx-1 plays a key role in cell growth and survival, as well as chemoresistance,
and is a potential target to overcome drug resistance in relapsed/refractory DLBCL.

INTRODUCTION

novel therapeutic approaches to target the current large,
heterogeneous, but poorly characterized population of
patients with r/r DLBCL. The development of resistance
to DLBCL therapy is currently the most challenging
impediment to effective DLBCL therapy; the rapid
development of multidrug resistance to structurally and
functionally unrelated cancer drugs results in the early
demise of nearly half of DLBCL patients.[2] Although
progress in reversal of multidrug resistance, to result in
effective therapy, has been slow and often disappointing in
recent years,[3] new approaches to this daunting problem
are essential for the ever-increasing numbers of patients
with r/r DLBCL. The elucidation of molecular pathways
and tumor-encoded genes whose expression contributes to
the intrinsic resistance and the rapid growth of DLBCL
cells could yield immediate clinical benefits and reveal
new therapeutic targets for effective control and treatment
of r/r DLBCL.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the fifth most
common cancer in the United States, and its incidence
continues to increase. NHL affects all ethnic, racial, and
gender groups approximately equally. Diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of NHL,
with ~30,000 new cases per year in the US. DLBCL is
initially chemoresponsive, with an overall response
(complete response or partial response) rate of ~80%
to frontline R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide,
doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemoimmunotherapy. However, DLBCL frequently recurs (in
~40-50% of patients; usually within 2-3 years, depending
on patient risk factors) as relapsed/refractory (r/r),
incurable DLBCL with poor survival rates after current,
inadequate salvage therapy regimens.[1]

The thioredoxin (Trx) system is a major antioxidant
system that is integral to maintaining the intracellular
redox state. It contains thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1, TXN), a
low-molecular-weight (10–12-kDa) cellular redox protein
found in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Trx-1 regulates the
activity of various enzymes, including those that function
to counteract oxidative stress within the cell.[4] In

addition, intracellular Trx-1 exerts most of its antioxidant
properties by scavenging of reactive oxygen species.
Moreover, intracellular Trx-1 acts as a co-factor for several
enzymes and plays an important role in the regulation of
redox-sensitive transcription factors.[5] Trx-1 is a protooncogene that stimulates tumor growth and inhibits both
spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis.[6] Increased

estimated with a Kaplan–Meier plot, and the groups were compared using the log-rank test.

Trx-1 gene expression is also associated with increases in
both hypoxia-induced factor 1α (HIF-1α) levels and HIF1 transactivation in cancer cells,[7] resulting in increased
VEGF production and enhanced tumor angiogenesis.[8] In
addition, overexpression of Trx-1 has been correlated with
aggressive tumor growth, poorer prognosis, and decreased
survival in patients with solid tumors.[9] Trx-1 appears
to have an important role in maintaining the transformed
phenotype of some human cancers as well as their
resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and is thus a rational
target for cancer drug development. Trx was originally
identified as an autocrine growth factor in transformed
lymphoid cells.[10, 11] Increased Trx expression has been
implicated in increased proliferation in various tumor
types and model systems. However, there is a lack of
supporting experimental evidence about the physiological
and therapeutic significance of the Trx family in DLBCL.
Recent preclinical in vitro data and clinical data in solid
tumors strongly support the notion that the Trx system is
of importance and that the development of drugs acting
via the Trx system is a promising route, particularly for
aggressive r/r DLBCL.
In this study, we showed that DLBCL tumors
express higher basal levels of Trx-1 than normal B cells
(by both western blotting and real-time PCR) and that

Trx-1 expression level was significantly associated with
decreased overall survival duration in DLBCL patients.
Therefore, we hypothesize that Trx-1 plays an important
role in the biology of DLBCL, particularly in regulating
key growth/survival and chemoresistance mechanisms.
The experimental design for this study was to characterize
the expression of Trx-1, at both the mRNA and protein
levels, in DLBCL and to thereby elucidate the functional
significance of Trx-1 in the biology of DLBCL. Our results
show that Trx-1 not only controls cell growth and survival
but also regulates chemoresistance in the pathophysiology
of DLBCL, and that targeting Trx-1 in DLBCL may have
therapeutic significance.

RESULTS
Trx-1 is overexpressed in DLBCL
We first evaluated the expression of Trx-1 in
DLBCL cells, both in cell lines and in primary tumor
cells, compared with normal B lymphocytes. We found
that Trx-1 protein is overexpressed in DLBCL cell lines,
of both the activated B-cell-like (ABC) and germinal
center B-cell-like (GCB) subtypes, compared with G0
naïve (unstimulated) or activated B cells (Figure 1A).
Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed that Trx-1 mRNA
expression is significantly higher (P = .008) in DLBCL cell
lines than in normal B cells (Figure 1B). We then analyzed
the expression levels of Trx-1 in primary DLBCL cells
using Oncomine (https://www.oncomine.org), a publicly
available cDNA cancer microarray database. Analysis of
a representative data set (from Basso et al)[12] indicated
that Trx-1 mRNA levels were higher in primary DLBCL

cells than in normal B cells at different stages (Figure
1C). We also analyzed the Trx-1 gene expression profile
in other types of lymphoid malignancies, and the results
indicated that other types of lymphoma also have high
expression of Trx-1 mRNA (Figure S1). Further analysis
of other lymphoma profiling data sets (from Rosenwald
et al[13, 14] and Alizadeh et al[15]) also showed high
expression of Trx-1 in DLBCL, particularly the ABC
subtype (Figure S2). We then examined the clinical
significance of Trx-1 overexpression in primary DLBCL
cells by using gene expression microarray analysis of a
240-sample data set with known clinical profiles.[13]
Elevated Trx-1 expression was found to be significantly
associated with decreased cumulative overall survival rate
(P = .028; Figure 1D). These results suggest that Trx-1
is overexpressed in DLBCL, indicating that Trx-1 likely
plays a key role in the pathobiology of DLBCL.

cells and histiocytes was, in most cases, in both the
cytoplasm and the nucleus. When we combined results
from both TMAs, the percentage of cases with negative,
weak/intermediate, and strong Trx-1 staining in tumor
cells was 27%, 39%, and 34%, respectively (Tables 1
and 2). The total percentage of cases with positive Trx1 staining in tumor cells was 73%. We found Trx-1positive histiocyte involvement in 29% of the cases with
Trx-1-negative tumor cells, 52% of the cases with weak/
intermediate Trx-1 staining in tumor cells, and 43% of the
cases with strong Trx-1 staining in tumor cells (Tables I
and II). Trx-1-positive histiocyte involvement was 42%.
In TMA2, there was no significant association was found
between Trx-1 positivity/negativity and overall survival
duration (data not shown). This lack of association may
be due to the low number of cases available. However,
we did find an association between Trx-1 expression level
and relapse status: patients with strong Trx-1 expression
were more likely to have experienced relapse (50%) than
those with negative Trx-1 expression (31%) (Table II).
These relapsed cases were independent of Trx-1-positive
histiocyte involvement (data not shown). We also
evaluated Trx-1 expression in normal lymphoid tissues. In
contrast to tumor cells, Trx-1 expression was not present
in lymphocytes of reactive tonsil (Figure 3A-B), reactive
lymph node (Figure 3C), or normal spleen (Figure 3D);
however, some macrophage-like cells outside of the cortex
as well as inside the follicles did stain positive for Trx-1
(Figure 3B). These results suggest that Trx-1 may play an
intrinsic as well as an extrinsic (tumor microenvironment)
role in the biology of DLBCL cells.

TMA analysis of Trx-1 protein expression in
DLBCL
Next, we performed immunohistochemical analysis
of Trx-1 on TMAs of primary DLBCL and normal
lymphoid tissues. Two TMAs comprising primary DLBCL
were used: a commercially available TMA consisting of 92
cases but with no clinical data (TMA1, US Biomax) and a
TMA produced at MD Anderson Cancer Center consisting
of 47 cases with clinical data (TMA2). Figure 2A-F shows
representative cases from these TMAs with negative and
positive Trx-1 staining. Trx-1 was found to be highly
expressed not only in tumor cells (Figure 2D) but also in
histiocytes in the surrounding tumor microenvironment
with macrophage- or fibroblast-/dendritic-like morphology
(Figure 2E-F). The pattern of Trx-1 expression in tumor

Role of Trx-1 in cell growth and chemoresistance
in DLBCL

in the resistant cell line than in the parental cell line. In
addition, we found that cells from the resistant cell line
(McA-DR) formed cell clusters in culture medium and
were more clonogenic in methylcellulose culture than the
parental cell line (McA) (Figure 5D). Downregulation of
Trx-1 by siRNA in the McA-DR cell line reversed the
clonogenic activity (Figure 5E).

To determine the biological significance of Trx1 in the growth and survival of DLBCL, we used Trx-1
validated siRNA to knock down Trx-1 gene expression
in two representative DLBCL cell lines, MS and OCILY10 (Figure 4A). siRNA against Trx-1 resulted in the
inhibition of DLBCL cell growth by 50% after 3 days of
incubation (Figure 4B). As our data showed that there
is an association between the Trx-1 expression level
and relapse status in DLBCL patients, we evaluated the
chemoresistance mechanism of Trx-1 in DLBCL cell
lines. First, we tested whether ablating Trx-1 expression
in DLBCL cells can sensitize these cells to Dox, a main
ingredient in frontline CHOP chemotherapy. Our data
show that inhibition of Trx-1 expression sensitized
DLBCL cells to Dox in two representative DLBCL cell
lines (Figure 4C), suggesting that Trx-1 may play a role
in drug resistance. Next, we generated a Dox-resistant
(DR) DLBCL cell line (McA-DR) from a parental cell
line (McA) that was initially highly sensitive to Dox
(Figure 5A), by continuously exposing cells to gradually
increasing doses of Dox. The resistant phenotype has been
retained for more than 6 months despite growth in drugfree medium. We found that Trx-1 expression levels, both
protein (Figure 5B) and mRNA (Figure 5C), were higher

Effect of the Trx-1 inhibitor PX-12 in DLBCL
cells
Additional experiments were performed to ascertain
if pharmacologic agents targeting Trx-1 could recapitulate
the effects of Trx-1 knock-down in DLBCL cells. PX-12
specifically inhibits Trx-1 by irreversibly thio-alkylating
the Cys73 residue of Trx-1.[16, 17] PX-12 inhibition
of Trx-1 has previously shown both excellent in vitro
antitumor activity and promising in vivo antitumor activity
in solid tumors.[18, 19] To test the efficacy of PX-12 in
DLBCL cells, we exposed 18 DLBCL cell lines, including
the Dox-resistant cell line McA-DR, to increasing
concentrations (0–50 µM) of PX-12 and then analyzed
cell proliferation using thymidine incorporation assays.
The growth of all DLBCL cell lines was inhibited by PX12 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6A), and the half
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for PX-12
in each cell line was determined after testing a range of

Dox-resistant cell line, McA-DR, was more sensitive
to PX-12 than the parental cell line McA (Figure 6B).
However, the mRNA level of Trx-1 does not correlate
with PX-12 sensitivity in DLBCL cell lines (Figure S3B).
In McA-DR cells, PX-12 induced apoptosis in a dosedependent manner (Figure 6C) and induced cell cycle

arrest at the G2M phase (Figure 6D). In McA-DR cells,
treatment with the Trx-1 inhibitor PX-12 also inhibited
the clonogenic activity (Figure 6E). These results suggest
that PX-12 is a potential therapeutic agent that can reverse
chemoresistance in DLBCL.

DISCUSSION

inhibition of Trx-1 in DLBCL cells are mediated, at least
in part, by down-regulation of several key genes that are
known to play a role in drug resistance mechanisms.

Chemoresistance is a major impediment to the
treatment of patients with r/r DLBCL. Efforts to reverse
chemoresistance of refractory DLBCL cells have been
largely unsuccessful. On the basis of our data, we
conclude that overexpression of Trx-1 in DLBCL cell
lines and primary cells is associated with growth and
survival, as well as chemoresistance, and that targeting
Trx-1 with the novel Trx-1 inhibitor PX-12 may reverse
chemoresistance. We postulate that the acquisition of high
Trx-1 expression, either in tumor cells or in cells of the
tumor microenvironment in DLBCL, may have occurred
during chemotherapy, in a stressful microenvironment,
to enable the cells to better tolerate oxidative stress. As a
result, high basal expression of Trx-1 in tumor cells or in
stromal cells of the surrounding microenvironment may
lead to the up-regulation of critical drug resistance genes
and the development of chemoresistance.
Although the basis for the high expression of Trx-1
in DLBCL is still unclear, a recent study demonstrated that
VDUP-1 (vitamin D3 upregulated protein 1; also called
TXNIP [thioredoxin-interacting protein-1] or TBP-2 [Trxbinding protein-2]), is downregulated in DLBCL.[20] Trx1 activity can be modulated by interaction with VDUP1, suggesting that VDUP-1 is a natural physiological
inhibitor of Trx-1.[21] The Lymphoma/Leukemia
Molecular Profiling Project used microarray technology
to define a molecular profile for patients with DLBCL
and developed a molecular outcome predictor score that
accurately predicted patient survival.[20] The results
suggested that DLBCL patients with the worst prognosis,
according to the outcome predictor score, had decreased
expression of catalase, glutathione peroxidase, manganese
superoxide dismutase, and VDUP-1. Patients with the
worst prognosis seemed to combine decreased expression
of antioxidant defense enzymes with increased Trx
system function (the redox signature score).[20] In fact,
our analysis of a recent lymphoma profiling data set of
240 cases also indicated a significant association between
high Trx-1 expression and decreased overall survival rate.
These studies suggest a direct involvement of VDUP-1
and Trx-1 in the biology of DLBCL, but further studies
are required to decipher their relationship with respect to
their function in chemoresistance.
Here, we found that Dox-resistant cells express
higher levels of Trx-1 gene and that downregulation of
Trx-1 in these cells reversed the chemoresistant phenotype,
suggesting that the high expression of Trx-1 in DLBCL
may have been acquired during chemotherapy. Elevated
Trx levels have also been implicated in the resistance of
tumor cells to several commonly used chemotherapeutic
agents, namely cisplatin, docetaxel, and anthracyclines
(Dox).[22, 23] A gain of Trx-1 locus has been observed in
drug-resistant cells identified by array CGH analysis,[24]
suggesting that this locus is prone to genomic imbalances

imposed by chemotherapy. High Trx-1 levels have also
been shown to favor enhanced tumor cell survival and, in
some studies, have been associated with poor prognosis
in cancer patients.[25, 26] Although the mechanism of the
chemoresistance function of Trx-1 is still unclear, Trx-1
itself regulates the activity of various transcription factors,
including NF-κB, which is known be highly activated in
DLBCL.[6] Our Trx-1 knock-down experiments showed
that HIF-1α is a down-stream target gene of Trx-1,
consistent with previous studies.[8] These results also
show that Trx-1 can modulate several important genes
that have shown to be involved in the pathophysiology of
DLBCL or have had negative prognostic value in DLBCL
patients, including bcl-2,[27] TOP2a,[28] GST-pi,[29]
CYP1A1,[30] TP53,[31] and CDK’s.[32-34] Of these
genes, bcl-2,[35] GST-pi,[36] and TP53[37] are direct
targets of Trx-1 in other systems. Clearly, coordinated
down-regulation of several Trx-1 potential target genes,
either directly or indirectly, could be responsible for
protecting DLBCL cells against anticancer drugs.
However, the contribution of individual Trx-1 target genes
in chemoresistance may be different. Further investigation
is warranted and necessary to determine the signaling
components associated with Trx-1 and related downstream
targets involved in growth/survival and chemoresistance in
the pathophysiology of DLBCL.
Interestingly, we also found that Trx-1 is highly
expressed not only in DLBCL tumor cells but also in
stromal cells in the surrounding tumor microenvironment.
This result is quite timely as a recent study demonstrated
that stromal cells in the lymph node microenvironment
of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL)
patients strongly expressed Trx-1 and produced soluble
Trx-1 that can rescue CLL cells from apoptosis in vitro.
[38] It has also been shown that Trx-1 is secreted by B
lymphocytes,[10] monocytes,[39] regulatory T cells,[40]
and a variety of cancer cells, and Trx-1 has previously
been shown to exhibit cytokine-like properties by
stimulating and activating normal B lymphocytes.[10]
Soluble Trx-1 could function as an autocrine growth
factor for human normal and at lease some malignant
lymphoid cells.[41] Other studies have also suggested
that soluble Trx-1 acts synergistically with CD40
stimulation to induce S-phase entry and mitosis in normal
B cells and B-CLL.[41] The CD40 pathway has been
implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease process
of DLBCL[42-45] and has been shown to play a key role
in chemoresistance.[46] These studies imply that the
pre-existing activated CD40 pathway in concert with the
extrinsic (tumor microenvironment signals) and intrinsic
roles of Trx-1 in DLBCL cells could be important features
that appear to provide cell growth and survival, as well
as chemoresistance, advantages in DLBCL, particularly
in r/r DLBCL. Therefore, the use of drugs, like PX-12,
that inhibit the redox activity of Trx-1 might offer a novel
approach to reverse chemoresistance in relapsed DLBCL.

In fact, PX-12 has been used in human phase I and II
clinical trials in solid tumors. PX-12 is well tolerated in
solid tumors, and with our preclinical rationale we may
now be able to explore the utility of this Trx-1 inhibitor
alone or more likely in combination with newly identified
cytotoxic or novel agents in reversing resistance and
treating patients with r/r DLBCL.
This study has provided important new advances in
understanding the biology of DLBCL chemoresistance,
a very important but largely unknown, challenging
area of lymphoma therapeutics, which may lead to the
development of new, more effective approaches to treating
this most common type of lymphoid cancer, particularly
the increasing r/r form of DLBCL, which is currently
incurable and rapidly leads to the patient’s demise.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cells and reagents
Human DLBCL cell lines (MS, DS, DB, JM [McA],
FN, EJ, HF, HB, MZ, LR, CJ, LP, and PL) were established
from tissue biopsy or effusion specimens from patients
as described elsewhere.[47] The SUDHL-4, SUDHL-6,
OCI-LY3, and OCI-LY10 DLBCL cell lines were obtained
from Dr. Michael Rosenblum (The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). The BJAB
cell line was obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). This study was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki
and approved by the Institutional Review Board of MD
Anderson Cancer Center. Informed consent was obtained
from all patients whose tumor samples were used. The
cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco,
Rockville, MD) containing 15% fetal calf serum (FCS)
(HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT). The monoclonal Trx1 antibody and the Trx-1 inhibitor PX-12 (1-methylpropyl
2-imidazolyl disulfide) were provided by Dr. Garth
Powis.[16, 19] The Trx-1 validated small interfering RNA
(siRNA) and control siRNA were purchased from Applied
Biosystems/Ambion (Austin, TX).

TMA analysis and immunohistochemistry
We used two DLBCL tissue microarrays (TMAs).
TMA1, consisting of 92 cases of DLBCL (TMA
LY1001; a single core per case), was purchased from
US Biomax (Rockville, MD), and TMA2, consisting
of 47 cases of DLBCL, was provided by Dr. Francisco
Vega.[48] The TMA slides were dewaxed at 55°C for 20
minutes, followed by three 5-minute washes with xylene.
Immunostaining was performed using 5-µm-thick,
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections, epitope
retrieval with Diva deblocking buffer and a deblocking
322

chamber, and the Mach 3 system (all from Biocare
Medical, Concord, CA). Staining was performed using the
Autostainer Plus (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). The
washing buffer used was 0.05 M Tris (tris(hydroxymethyl)
aminomethane)-buffered saline supplemented with
0.05% Tween. 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
was used as the chromogen (Liquid DAB+ substrate
chromogen system, DakoCytomation), and all tissue
sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The
evaluation of Trx-1 staining was semiquantitatively scored
by 3 scientists (L.V.P., R.J.F., F.V.) TMA positivity for
Trx-1 was defined as immunostaining in >30% of the
cells. Trx-1 protein expression was scored as negative,
weak, or strong depending on the staining signal intensity.
TMA photomicrographs were captured using an Olympus
BX41 dual-head light microscope equipped with an
Olympus Q-Color5 digital camera (Olympus America,
Melville, NY), with a 20× plan apochromat objective.
Digital images were obtained and adjusted using Adobe
Photoshop CS3 (Adobe Systems).

containing 12.5 µL of TaqMan Universal PCR Master
Mix, No AmpErase UNG, 8.75 µL of water, and 1.25 µL
of primers and probe sets. The primers and probes were
purchased from Applied Biosystems and were designed
to span exon–exon boundaries. The Human Cancer Drug
Resistance and Metabolism PCR Arrays were purchased
from SAbiosciences (Frederick, MD). Amplification
was performed in the ABI Fast 7500 Real-Time PCR
system (Applied Biosystems) using the following cycling
program: 95°C for 10 minutes; 40 cycles of 95°C for 15
seconds, 60°C for 60 seconds. All samples were analyzed
in triplicate. DNA contamination was evaluated by
performing PCR on the non-reverse-transcribed control of
each sample. The relative expression levels of the genes of
interest were normalized to the endogenous reference 18S
and relative to a control sample as a calibrator by using
the formula 2–∆∆CT. The threshold cycle (CT) reflects the
cycle number at which the fluorescence generated within
a reaction crosses the threshold.

Establishment of doxorubicin-resistant cell lines

Proliferation assays

We generated a doxorubicin-resistant (DR) DLBCL
cell line (McA-DR) from a parental cell line (McA) by
multistep exposures of cells to increasing doses (up to 50
ng/mL) of doxorubicin (Dox) for 8 weeks. Briefly, cells
were initially cultured in a low drug concentration for
1 week and then maintained in drug-free medium for 1
week to stabilize the cells. Medium with increasing drug
concentration was changed every other week during the
selection, and subsequently the cells became resistant to
Dox. The resistant clones were expanded in drug-free
media. Expanded clones were retested for drug resistance
before any further studies.

In vitro thymidine incorporation (proliferation)
assays were performed as described previously.[49]
Briefly, cells were plated (in triplicate) at 4.0 × 104 cells/
well in 200 µL of RPMI 1640 with 15% FCS and the
indicated reagents in a 96-well plate and incubated in 5%
CO2 at 37°C. After 48 hours, each well was pulsed with
0.5 µCi/10 µL of [3H]thymidine (Amersham, Arlington
Heights, IL) for 16 hours. Cells were harvested, and the
radioactivity was measured.

Immunoblot analysis

Transient transfection of DLBCL cells

Whole-cell extracts were solubilized with 1.0%
SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on a 4–15%
SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). Proteins were
transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane
and were probed with various specific primary antibodies
and the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized using the
ECL system (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ).

DLBCL cells (MS and OCI-LY10) were transiently
transfected with 50 nM Trx-1 validated siRNA (Applied
Biosystems/Ambion) using the Neon transfection
system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).[50] The transfection
efficiency ranges from 70% to 80% with 75% cell viability
for MS cells, and from 50% to 60% with 70% viability for
OCI-LY10 cells.

RNA isolation and real-time PCR

Methylcellulose clonogenic assays

Total RNA isolation was performed by using Trizol
LS Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Reverse transcription of RNA was carried
out with a cDNA archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). Synthesized cDNA was subjected to real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection
of related gene transcripts (Trx-1 and 18S). In brief, 2.5
µL of cDNA was placed in a 25-µL reaction volume
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The colony formation assay in methylcellulose
(M3434; StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC,
Canada) was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, DLBCL cells were initially plated
in methylcellulose at a density of 2 × 103 cells/0.3 mL/
well in a 12-well plate and incubated for 10–14 days.
Colonies were stained with p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet,

photographed, and counted using QCapture Pro software
(QImaging, Surrey, BC, Canada). All experiments were
performed in duplicate and repeated at least 3 times.
Apoptosis analysis by Annexin V/propidium iodide
(PI) staining and cell cycle analysis by PI staining and flow
cytometry analysis methods were previously described.
