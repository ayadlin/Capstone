Abstract
MicroRNAs (miRNA) aberrantly expressed in tumors may offer novel therapeutic approaches to treatment.
miR-145 is downregulated in various cancers including colon carcinoma in which in vitro studies have
established proapoptotic and antiproliferative roles. miR-33a was connected recently to cancer through its
capacity to downregulate the oncogenic kinase Pim-1. To date, miRNA replacement therapy has been hampered
by the lack of robust nonviral delivery methods for in vivo administration. Here we report a method of miRNA
delivery by using polyethylenimine (PEI)-mediated delivery of unmodified miRNAs, using miR-145 and miR-33a
to preclinically validate the method in a mouse model of colon carcinoma. After systemic or local application of
low molecular weight PEI/miRNA complexes, intact miRNA molecules were delivered into mouse xenograft
tumors, where they caused profound antitumor effects. miR-145 delivery reduced tumor proliferation and
increased apoptosis, with concomitant repression of c-Myc and ERK5 as novel regulatory target of miR-145.
Similarly, systemic injection of PEI-complexed miR-33a was validated as a novel therapeutic targeting method
for Pim-1, with antitumor effects comparable with PEI/siRNA-mediated direct in vivo knockdown of Pim-1 in the
model. Our findings show that chemically unmodified miRNAs complexed with PEI can be used in an efficient
and biocompatible strategy of miRNA replacement therapy, as illustrated by efficacious delivery of PEI/miR-145
and PEI/miR-33a complexes in colon carcinoma. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5214–24. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are highly conserved, small 17 to 25
nucleotide (nt) noncoding RNA molecules which specifically
interact with target mRNAs, thus inhibiting translation or
leading to mRNA cleavage and degradation (1). It is estimated
from in silico analyses that miRNAs can control the expression
of approximately 30% of all proteins in humans (2), and it has
become clear that miRNAs regulate various cellular processes.
Many miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in pathologies such as
cancer, leading to the identification of "miRNA signatures"
characteristic of certain tumors (3). Tumor-specific miRNA
expression profiles are also functionally relevant because
many miRNAs act as tumor suppressors or, to the contrary,
as oncogenes (oncomiRs). For many miRNAs, target genes

have been identified which are relevant in tumorigenesis,
tumor growth, tumor angiogenesis, and metastasis (see ref.
4 for review). Crucial for miRNA specificity is the "seed region"
(nt 2–8); however, owing to this limited sequence, complementarity miRNAs are capable of simultaneously targeting
different genes. In fact, it is estimated that some miRNAs may
have more than 100 target genes. This translates into a
complex pattern of control of gene expression and suggests
potentially increased efficacies of miRNAs by acting through
different genes and pathways.
The observation of pathologically decreased levels of certain miRNAs acting as tumor suppressors has led to the
concept of miRNA replacement therapy. Indeed, the reintroduction of miR-26a in a liver cancer mouse model by using an
adeno-associated viral vector resulted in the inhibition of
cancer cell proliferation, induction of tumor-specific apoptosis, and protection from disease progression (5). In line with
this, the adenovirus-mediated delivery of a plasmid coding for
miRNA let-7 reduced lung tumor formation in an orthotopic
lung cancer mouse model (6). Likewise, intranasal administration of a lentiviral let-7 miRNA construct led to reduced
tumor burden in an autochthonous non–small cell lung
carcinoma tumor mouse model (7). This study also explored
synthetic, formulated let-7 oligonucleotides which, upon
intratumoral (i.t.) injection, led to reduced tumor growth
(7). Local and/or systemic delivery in non–small lung cancer
xenografts showed antitumor effects upon application of miR34 formulated with a lipid-based delivery reagent (8). The

Therapeutic PEI/miRNA Delivery

same miRNA exhibited survivin downregulation and reduced
metastatic tumor load in the lung when delivered in a liposomal nanoparticle formulation (9). In prostate tumors
initiated in the bones of mice, intravenously (i.v.) injected
atelocollagen-complexed miR-16 mimics led to reduced tumor
growth (10). Finally, in colorectal carcinoma xenografts, i.t. or
i.v. injection of miR-143 formulated in cationic liposomes
resulted in antitumor effects in the case of modified (for
increased nuclease resistance) miR-143, but not unmodified
miR-145 (11). This so far limited number of studies that are
not based on viruses indicates that applications aiming at
miRNA replacement therapy critically depend on the development of miRNA delivery tools. Because viral delivery may
raise several issues including potential safety problems
because of the application of recombinant DNA, induction
of toxic immune responses, and possible changes in gene
expression upon random integration of DNA in the host
genome, nonviral strategies would be preferable.
Colon carcinoma is the third most common form of cancer
and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the
Western world. Despite a favorable prognosis when detected
at early stages, it is associated with limited survival when
metastatic disease is present, which indicates the need for
novel treatment strategies. In colon carcinoma, decreased
levels of miRNA-145 are observed (see ref. 12), and previous
in vitro studies have established a proapoptotic and antiproliferative role of miR-145 (13). In contrast, the functional
relevance of miR-33a in cancer has only recently been established. It was shown that miR-33a can repress the protooncogene Pim-1 to act as a tumor suppressor inhibiting cellcycle progression (14). Thus, both miRNA-145 and miR-33a
may represent attractive candidates for miRNA replacement
therapy that have not been explored so far.
Polyethylenimines (PEI) are linear or branched polymers
which are partially protonated under physiologic conditions,
thus allowing the formation of complexes with nucleic acids
(15). PEIs have been used previously for the delivery of DNA
plasmids (15) and other DNA or RNA molecules including
ribozymes (16) and siRNAs (17). PEI-based complexes (polyplexes) are able to enter the cells via caveolae- or clathrindependent routes and, once internalized, the high efficiency of
PEI polyplexes is governed by their facilitated release from
endosomes due to the so called "proton sponge effect" (18).
This is the first study to explore the therapeutic effects of
PEI/miRNA complexes. We introduce the low molecular
weight branched PEI F25-LMW (19, 20) as a delivery platform
for nonmodified miRNAs in miRNA replacement therapy and
show antitumor effects of PEI/miRNA complexes upon their
local or systemic application.

phosphates. Additional details and sequences can be found in
the Supplementary Methods.
All cell lines were obtained from the American type culture
collection and authenticated by the vendor. Cells were cultivated in a humidified incubator under standard conditions
(37 C, 5% CO2) in keratinocyte-SFM medium (Invitrogen
GmbH) supplemented with 20 to 30 mg/mL bovine pituitary
extract, 0.1 to 0.2 ng/mL rEGF, and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS;
PAA; 1205LU cells) or IMDM/10% FCS (all other cell lines).
Athymic nude mice (nu/nu) were purchased from Harlan
Winkelmann and kept at 23 C in a humidified atmosphere
with food and water ad libitum. Animal studies were done
according to the national regulations and approved by the
Regierungspr€asidium Giessen, Germany.
PEI complexation of RNAs
PEI F25-LMW/miRNA complexes were prepared essentially
as described previously for siRNAs (20, 22). Briefly, 10 mg
miRNA was dissolved in 75 mL 10 mmol/L HEPES/150
mmol/L NaCl, pH 7.4, and incubated for 10 minutes. Ten
microliters of PEI F25-LMW (5 mg/mL) (19) was dissolved in 75
mL of the same buffer, and after 10 minutes, pipetted to the
miRNA solution. This resulted in an N/P ratio ¼ 33 which had
been determined as optimal for siRNAs (20). For in vivo
experiments, the mixture was divided into aliquots and stored
frozen (23). Prior to use, complexes were thawed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. jetPEI complexation
was done in 1 mol/L HEPES/150 mmol/L NaCl, pH 7.4 at
N/P ¼ 5 as described previously (22).
miRNA tissue uptake in vivo
For the radioactive determination of miRNA tissue distribution, 0.6 mg (0.05 nmol) miRNA were [32P] end–labeled at
both strands by using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England
Biolabs) and g-[32P] ATP (GE Healthcare), prior to purification
by microspin columns (Bio-Rad) to remove unbound radioactivity and complexation as described above. A total of 1.5 
106 LS174T cells in 150 mL PBS were injected s.c. into both
flanks of athymic nude mice (nu/nu) and grown until they
reached a size of approximately 8 mm in diameter. The
complexes, or noncomplexed labeled miRNAs as negative
control, were dissolved in 200 mL or 100 mL PBS for intraperitoneal (i.p.) or i.v. injection, respectively. After 4 hours, mice
were sacrificed, organs were removed, and subjected to RNA
preparation as described above. The total RNA was dissolved
in 200 mL DEPC-treated water, and 10-mL samples were mixed
with loading buffer, heat denatured, and subjected to agarose
gel electrophoresis before blotting and autoradiography (Biomax; Eastman-Kodak). Quantitation was done by phosphorimager analysis.

tumors were established, mice were randomized into specific
treatment, negative control treatment, and nontreatment
groups (n ¼ 12 tumors per group). Treatment with PEI/
miRNA or PEI/siRNA complexes was done by i.p. injection
of 0.77 nmol (10 mg) or i.t. injection of 0.3 nmol (4 mg) PEI F25LMW-complexed specific or nonspecific siRNA at the time
points indicated in the figures. Tumor volumes were monitored every 2 to 3 days as indicated in the figures and, upon
termination of the experiment, mice were sacrificed and
tumors removed. Pieces of each s.c. tumor were immediately
fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde for paraffin embedding or
snap-frozen for RNA preparation or Western blot analysis.
Proliferation and soft agar assays
For the assessment of anchorage-dependent proliferation,
cells were seeded 24 hours prior to transfection in 96-well
plates at 1,000 (LS174T) or 300 (HCT-116) cells per well.
Transfections were done by the addition of the specific or
nonspecific PEI F25-LMW/miRNA or jetPEI/miRNA complexes corresponding to 10 pmol miRNA per well. At the
time points indicated, the numbers of viable cells in 8 wells
were determined by using a colorimetric assay according to
the manufacturer's protocol (Cell Proliferation Reagent
WST-1; Roche).
Anchorage-independent proliferation was studied in soft
agar assays essentially as described previously (24). A total of
1  105 cells per well were transfected in 6-well plates with 100
nmol/L PEI-complexed miRNAs or nonspecific control siRNA
and 24 hours after transfection, trypsinized and counted. A
total of 20,000 cells in 0.35% agar (Bacto Agar; Becton Dickinson) were layered on top of 1 mL of a solidified 0.6% agar
layer in a 35-mm dish. Growth media with 2% FCS were
included in both layers. After 2 to 3 weeks of incubation,
colonies more than 50 mm in diameter were counted by at
least 2 independent blinded investigators.
Caspase assay and fluorescein isothiocyanate–Annexin
assay
To test for apoptosis in vitro, a commercially available
bioluminescent caspase-3/7 assay (Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay;
Promega) was applied. The Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay was conducted in 96-wells with cells transfected as described above,
and luminescence was measured after 1 hour incubation at
27 C in the dark by using a Fluostar Optima reader (BMG
Labtec). To normalize for differences in cell densities, a WST-1
assay was carried out in parallel on the same plate, and the
results of caspase activity were adjusted to cell numbers of the
different cell lines.
To distinguish between early and late apoptosis, a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)–Annexin assay was done (Becton Dickinson). LS174T cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L
miRNAs in 6-well plates by using jetPEI as described above.
After 120 hours, the cells were harvested by trypsinization,
washed twice with cold PBS, and resuspended in 1 binding
buffer (0.01 mol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 140 mmol/L NaCl, and 2.5
mmol/L CaCl2) at a concentration of 106 cells/mL. A total of
100 mL of the cell suspension were transferred to a new
Eppendorf tube, 5 mL FITC–Annexin and then 5 mL propidium

iodide were added, the mixture was gently vortexed and
incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark.
Directly before measurement, 400 mL 1 binding buffer was
added to the mixture and samples were measured by FACS
(FACSCalibur; Becton-Dickinson) within 1 hour.
RNA preparation and quantitative RT-PCR for mRNA
and miRNA dectection
Total RNA from tumor cells was isolated by using the Trizol
reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For
tissue homogenization prior to RNA preparation, tissues were
mixed with 200 mL Trizol reagent and homogenized. Reverse
transcription (RT) by using the RevertAid H Minus First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit from Fermentas and quantitative
PCR in a LightCycler from Roche by using the QuantiTect
SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) were done according to the
manufacturers’ protocols and as described previously (20). To
normalize for equal cDNA amounts, PCR reactions with ERK5specific and with actin-specific primer sets were run in parallel
for each sample, and ERK5 levels were determined by the
formula 2CP(actin)/2CP(ERK5) with CP ¼ cycle number at the crossing point (0.3).
To isolate miRNA, the mirVana miRNA isolation kit was
used according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems). Adherent cells from a 6-well plate were trypsinized
and washed in PBS, prior to adding 300 to 600 mL lysis binding
buffer and vigorous vortexing. In case of tumor tissue, the lysis
binding buffer was added as 10 volumes of the tumor weight.
For miRNA RT, specific stem-looped RT primers were used as
described previously (25). The RT product was diluted 1:10 in
nuclease-free water and used as a template for quantitative
real-time PCR (see Supplementary Methods for primer
sequences) under the following conditions: 95 C for 15 minutes followed by 55 cycles comprising 95 C for 10 seconds,
55 C for 10 seconds, and 72 C for 10 seconds. Levels were
determined as described above.
Western blots and immunohistochemistry
LS174T cells from 6-well plates were scraped at 96 hours
posttransfection, lysed in 200 mL denaturating lysis buffer, and
sonicated for 20 seconds, prior to incubation on ice for 30
minutes and centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 25 minutes.
Tumor tissue was homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer [25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS] by using a
Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation and determination
of the protein concentration in the supernatant, samples were
analyzed by Western blotting (see Supplementary Methods for
details).
Immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded sections for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was done
essentially as described previously (ref. 20; see Supplementary Methods for details). For the assessment of proliferation, the PCNA staining intensity after diaminobenzidine
development was evaluated in at least 5 fields per section by
rating as 0 (no staining), 1 (weak staining), 2 (intermediate
staining), and 3 (strong staining), and expressed as PCNA
score.

ELISA
For the quantitation of Pim-1 by sandwich ELISA, the "Pim1 Total Antibody Pair" and buffers (Invitrogen) were used. The
procedure was done according to manufacturer's protocol
(see Supplementary Methods), with 100 mL supernatant from a
tumor sample (homogenized in PBS and centrifuged at 13,000
rpm) being analyzed per well.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were done by Student's t test, 1-way
ANOVA/Tukey's multiple comparison posttests or 2-way
ANOVA/Bonferroni posttests by using GraphPad Prism4,
and significance levels were *, P < 0.05, **, P < 0.01, ***, P <
0.001, #, not significant.

Results
Analysis of miR-145 levels in tumor cells
Levels of miR-145 were assessed in various tumor cell lines
and compared with the nontumor fibroblast cell line NIH/3T3
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Although our data confirm previous
studies about the downregulation of miR-145 in tumors (12,
26, 27), we also show that miR-145 levels depend on the cell
line. This is particularly true for prostate carcinoma cells with
levels being very low in DU-145 cells, whereas in PC-3 cells,
almost normal levels were observed. Likewise, 1205LU melanoma cells showed high miR-145 expression almost in the
range of nontumor cells. Notably, all 7 colon carcinoma cell
lines tested displayed low miR-145 levels, indicating that miR145 downregulation is a general feature in colon carcinoma
and relevant to the pathologic state of such tumors. For
subsequent experiments, the tumorigenic colon carcinoma
cell line LS174T and the particularly aggressive cell line HCT116 were selected.
PEI-mediated miRNA delivery in vitro
To explore whether PEI is able to deliver miRNAs into cells,
PEI complexes based on linear jetPEI or branched PEI F25LMW were prepared. Transfection of LS174T cells with PEI/
miRNA complexes led to more than 10-fold increase in
intracellular miR-145 levels, indicating that the intact miRNA
is efficiently delivered into the cells (Fig. 1A). JetPEI was used
in these experiments, because in vitro, it displays higher
transfection efficacy in this cell line than the branched PEI
F25-LMW (data not shown). More importantly, PEI-mediated
miRNA transfection led to markedly more than 60% reduced
cell proliferation as compared with nontransfected or negative
control transfected cells (Fig. 1B). As negative control, a small
dsRNA molecule with length, structure, and GC content
similar to that of the miRNAs studied here and directed
against an irrelevant gene (luciferase) was employed, and
complexed with PEI under identical conditions. The specific
inhibition of cell proliferation confirms the biological relevance of miR-145 in colon carcinoma cells in vitro and shows
that PEI-complexed miRNAs are functionally active. Results
were confirmed in soft agar assays which monitor anchorageindependent cell growth. Again, a marked reduction in cell
proliferation, as indicated by fewer and smaller colonies, was

www.aacrjournals.org

observed upon PEI-mediated miRNA delivery (Fig. 1C). The
comparison between nontransfected and negative control
transfected cells also shows the absence of nonspecific PEI
effects on proliferation (Fig. 1B and C).
The tumor cell inhibition resulting from the PEI-mediated
miR-145 delivery was studied in more detail on the cellular
and molecular level. In a fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS)-based FITC–Annexin assay, a more than 2-fold
increase in early-stage and late-stage apoptotic cells was
observed upon PEI/miR-145 treatment as compared with
negative controls (Fig. 1D). The parallel increase in caspase-3/-7 activation (Fig. 1E) indicated that this induction
of apoptosis relied on a caspase-3/-7–dependent pathway. In
addition, PEI/miR-145 treatment interfered with downstream
signal transduction relevant to proliferation. More specifically,
a decrease in ERK5 protein expression was observed; a parallel
reduction in ERK5 mRNA levels was less pronounced and
lacked statistical significance (Fig. 1F). Although miR-143 (see
below) has been shown previously to directly target ERK5 (28),
this establishes for the first time that ERK5 is modulated by
miR-145 as well.
miR-143 belongs to the same miRNA family as miR-145 and
has been shown to be downregulated along with miR-145 in
tumors including colon carcinoma (29). Indeed, when monitoring anchorage-independent growth in soft agar assays,
PEI-mediated delivery of miR-143 inhibited colony formation
similar to miR-145 (Supplementary Fig. S2, right). Anchoragedependent proliferation, however, was not impaired by miR143 (Supplementary Fig. S2, left). Thus, whereas miR-143
exerts some tumor cell–inhibiting effects as well, our findings
indicate differences between both miRNAs with regard
to biological effects and targeted pathways as suggested
previously (27). Because of its more universal antitumor
effects, miR-145 was selected for subsequent in vivo
experiments.
Antitumor effects upon systemic application of
PEI/miR-145 complexes
LS174T colon carcinoma cells were s.c. injected into athymic nude mice, and upon establishment of tumor xenografts,
mice were randomized into treatment and negative control
groups. In untreated controls and in mice which were i.p.
injected with PEI/nonspecific RNA complexes as negative
controls, rapid tumor growth was detected, with an approximately 15-fold increase in tumor volume over 23 days. In
contrast, i.p. injection of 10 mg PEI-complexed miR-145 three
times per week resulted in a statistically significant, almost
50% decrease in tumor growth (Fig. 2A). Upon termination of
the experiment, tumors (see representative examples in
Fig. 2A, right panel) were analyzed for ERK5, which has been
shown in vitro to be downregulated by miR-145 (see above).
Indeed, a statistically significant, that is, approximately 50%
decrease in ERK5 protein levels was detected in the tumors
(Fig. 2B, left), whereas, again comparable with the in vitro
situation, ERK5 mRNA levels remained largely unchanged
(data not shown). This indicates that PEI-delivered miR-145
exerts antitumor effects through inhibition of ERK5 translation. Strikingly, the PEI/miR-145 effects on c-Myc, another

with approximately 80% decreased c-Myc protein levels as
compared with negative controls (Fig. 2B, middle). Concomitantly, an approximately 50% reduction in tumor cell proliferation was observed in the specific treatment group (Fig. 2B,

Radioactive biodistribution experiments confirmed that the
observed effects were indeed based on the PEI-mediated
delivery of intact miRNA molecules. Upon i.p. injection of
PEI complexes containing [32P]-labeled miRNA, total RNAs
were prepared from tissues and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. This revealed substantial uptake of

miRNA in liver and kidney, among others, and to a lesser
extent in spleen (Fig. 2C, top right panel). Particularly high
levels of intact, full-length miRNA were observed in the tumor
xenografts (Fig. 2C, top right panel). In contrast, naked
miRNA was detectable, though, at very low levels in the tested
tissues, indicating the necessity for miRNA formulation with
PEI (Fig. 2C, top right panel). The quantitation of miRNA
bands and normalization for protein content confirmed the
PEI-mediated miRNA delivery into the xenografts (Fig. 2C,

liver and spleen, but not in s.c. tumor xenografts, and was thus
not employed in our experiments (Fig. 2C, bottom right

approximately 25% to 30% decrease in colony growth in soft
agar assays (Supplementary Fig. S3). Again, the treatment 3
times per week was started after the establishment of tumor
xenografts; however, because PEI complexes were applied
locally, miRNA amounts were reduced to 4 mg. No unwanted
side effects in terms of change in mouse body weight
(Supplementary Fig. S4A, right), behavioral alterations or
other signs of discomfort were observed. Untreated tumors
showed a rapid growth with an approximately 8-fold
increase over 2.5 weeks (Fig. 3A). Reduced tumor growth
was observed in the PEI/negative control RNA group, indicating some nonspecific effects of the PEI complexes upon
local injection (Fig. 3A). A control experiment confirmed the
nonspecific reduction of tumor growth also upon injection
of naked negative control RNA or PEI alone, indicating the
possibility of some local effects of the components of the PEI
complexes (Fig. 3B). Notably, however, the i.t. application of

introduces at least some tissue preference of the complexes,
even in the absence of an active ligand-mediated targeting. By
comparing the data with naked miRNAs (Fig. 2C, bottom right

intact miRNAs in a given tissue is dependent on PEI complexation.

To further explore the therapeutic applicability of PEI/

next. In these experiments, the particularly tumorigenic
colon carcinoma cell line HCT-116 was selected. Pre-experiments in vitro confirmed that PEI-mediated delivery of miR145 exerts antiproliferative effects also in this cell line, as
seen by a less profound, although still statistically significant

Therapeutic PEI/miRNA Delivery

Antitumor effects by systemic administration of
PEI/miR-33a complexes
To further substantiate the concept of PEI-mediated
miRNA replacement therapy, we selected a second miRNA,
miR-33a, which we showed more recently to be relevant in the
context of the oncogenic kinase Pim-1 (14). Pim-1 is upregulated in various cancers including lymphoma and colon
carcinoma, is a marker of poor prognosis in prostate carcinomas, and has been implicated in early transformation and
tumor progression (31, 32). Importantly, Pim-1 is negatively
regulated by miR-33a. Luciferase assays based on reporter
constructs comprising the luciferase gene and the Pim-1 30 UTR (untranslated region) revealed a direct effect of miR-33a
on the Pim-1 30 -UTR, as indicated by a approximately 50%
inhibition of luciferase activity (Supplementary Fig. S5A, left
panel). This effect was abolished upon miR-33a seed mutagenesis in the reporter construct (Supplementary Fig. S5A,
right panel), confirming the specificity of this effect. So far,
miR-33a has only been implicated with posttranscriptional
repression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1
(ABCA1) resulting in inhibition of cholesterol efflux from
macrophages and maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis

(33, 34). However, PEI-based in vitro transfection of miR33a resulted in decreased cell proliferation in colon carcinoma
cells, comparable with PEI/siRNA-mediated Pim-1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Thus, this establishes an
antiproliferative role of miR-33a and makes it an attractive
candidate miRNA for replacement therapy.
To assess the therapeutic antitumor activity of miR-33a
in vivo, mice bearing s.c. LS174T tumor xenografts were
treated by i.p. injection of PEI/miR-33a complexes. The
systemic PEI/miR-33a treatment starting upon establishment of the tumors at day 7 after cell injection resulted
in a statistically significant, that is, approximately 40%
reduction of tumor growth as compared with negative
control PEI/RNA-treated mice (Fig. 4A). Similar results were
obtained upon PEI-mediated delivery of a Pim-1–specific
siRNA (Fig. 4B; see Fig. 4C for representative mice). Concomitantly, the analysis of the tumors upon termination of
the experiment revealed an approximately 40% downregulation of Pim-1 in both treatment groups (Fig. 4D). The
analysis of the mouse body weights during the whole treatment period revealed no changes (Supplementary S4A, left),
and no other unwanted side effects in terms of behavioral
alterations or other signs of discomfort were observed. Upon
termination of the experiment, the determination of TNFa
serum levels showed no induction of TNFa, indicating the
absence of an immune response upon PEI/miRNA treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). Likewise, no increase in the
activity of the liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase
(AST; Supplementary Fig. S4C, left) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT; Supplementary Fig. S4C, right) were detected,
thus confirming the absence of hepatotoxicity.

Pim-1 protein levels (arbitr.units ± SEM)

PEI/miR-145 complexes resulted in a very profound tumor
growth inhibition, with tumor volumes in the treatment
group being reduced to approximately 40% or 60% of the
untreated or negative control–treated tumors, respectively
(Fig. 3A). After termination of the experiment, the immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors revealed a marked
antiproliferative effect of the PEI/miR-145 treatment
(Fig. 3C).

Discussion
With the discovery of RNA interference (RNAi), knockdown
strategies have gained increasing interest for the specific
inhibition of pathologically upregulated genes. More recently,
particular miRNAs were found to be aberrantly expressed in
several tumors, favoring tumor development (see ref. 3). The
functional relevance of miRNA dysregulation is supported by
the fact that the repression or reintroduction of a single
miRNA is able to substantially contribute to tumorigenesis,
tumor progression, and/or tumor metastasis, and can correlate with tumor differentiation, stage, and prognosis (for
review, see refs. 4, 35). Thus, in the case of upregulation,
miRNAs represent interesting target molecules for inhibition
through miRNA antagonists such as antagomiRs or antimiRs
(36, 37). However, miRNAs are more frequently downregulated
in tumors (38). Although this indicates the usefulness of
miRNA replacement therapy, only a very few studies have
explored this strategy so far. Although the literature on miRNA
functionality suggests that miRNA effects on a given gene may
be less pronounced than siRNA-mediated knockdown through
RNAi, the major advantage may lie in the fact that a given
miRNA targets many, possibly hundreds of genes, and consequently induces more widespread changes in protein
expression (39). In fact, it is the inherent mechanism of
miRNAs to repress a large number of mRNAs, also in the
case of less than 100% complementarity to the mRNA with
high specificity. Thus, the therapeutic application of a tumor
suppressor miRNA, which is downregulated in tumors, may
indeed entail multiple antitumor effects by specifically interfering with several oncogenic pathways, thus making it more
difficult for tumor cells to activate escape mechanisms. One
feature of this interference is the rather modest effects on any
given single gene, which may actually be an advantage because
the subtle regulation of genes is the natural mechanism
and therefore particularly attractive also from a therapeutic
viewpoint.
Our results establish, for the first time, miR-33a as tumorrelevant miRNA suited for miRNA replacement therapy.
Although miR-33a was previously shown to repress ABCA1,
an important positive regulator of high-density lipoprotein
synthesis and reverse cholesterol transport (33, 34), we have
recently shown that it is able to repress the proto-oncogene
Pim-1, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor (14). Here, we
show antitumor effects of miR-33a delivery in vivo; however, it
will have to be seen if a prolonged treatment may lead to
unwanted other effects related to the other functions of miR33a. Future studies with the goal to identify and verify other
miR-33a target genes will help to further scrutinize the suitability of miR-33a for miRNA replacement therapy. To this
end, in silico predictions are insufficient because we found
that, for example Cdk6, although identified by TargetScan 5.1
as another high probability target, is not regulated by miR-33a
(14). Consequently, experimental confirmation is always
needed to firmly establish any regulatory mechanism of
miRNAs. This is also true for miR-145, although several target
genes have already been confirmed (see ref. 13), including cMyc. Notably, we newly identify ERK5, which so far had only

5222

Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011

been reported as a target for the related miRNA miR-143 (40),
as being directly or indirectly regulated by miR-145.
Still, major limitations of siRNA-mediated therapeutic
knockdown strategies also apply to miRNAs: their protection
upon systemic injection in vivo, efficient delivery to the target
organ, cellular uptake, and intracellular release into the right
compartment. Although certain PEIs have been used previously for the delivery of other nucleic acids including small
RNA molecules in vitro and in vivo (see refs. 41, 42 for review),
this article establishes for the first time a PEI-based miRNA
replacement therapy. Notably, although several, if not all PEIs
are able to complex and protect nucleic acids, efficient PEI/
miRNA-mediated gene targeting in vivo relies on the sufficient
stability of the complexes as well as favorable pharmacokinetic properties and high biocompatibility. Our biodistribution data show the PEI-dependent delivery of unmodified
miRNAs into the tumors, where intact full-length miRNAs
accumulate. No chemical modifications of the miRNAs are
necessary and thus we avoid the term "miRNA mimics" to
indicate that it is in fact the naturally occurring miRNA
employed here.
The bioactivity and specificity of PEI/miRNA complexes is
shown by their antitumor effects and their inhibition of
specific targets (i.e., downregulation of c-Myc, ERK5, and
Pim-1). The previously observed biocompatibility of PEI
F25-LMW–based complexes (20), even upon repeated injection, was confirmed in this study also for PEI/miRNA complexes. Notably, they can be stored frozen for a prolonged
time, thus allowing their standardized preparation and injection as efficient and stable ready-to-use formulations without
the need of processing prior to administration.
The observed antitumor effects and the fact that no
unwanted side effects were detected indicate that the clinically more relevant systemic delivery rather than an only local
delivery (i.t. injection) can be pursued.
Interestingly, we observed that PEI-mediated miR-33a delivery versus PEI/siRNA-induced Pim-1 knockdown led to similar
antitumor effects. This was true despite the fact that oncogenic lesions commonly result in the simultaneous repression
of many miRNAs (ref. 43), suggesting that more than one
miRNA might be needed for a successful therapeutic intervention. However, previous studies indicated as well that the
delivery of just one miRNA already exerts tumor-inhibitory
effects (5–8, 10, 11). Nevertheless, it should be noted that the
nonviral delivery of miRNAs through PEI complexes easily
allows the combination of several miRNAs, which may result
in additive or synergistic effects. This may well lead to the
development of more personalized treatment strategies by
precisely analyzing miRNA expression profiles in a given
tumor prior to selectively combining miRNAs identified as
being downregulated.
Although miRNA replacement therapy seems to be rather
mild and biocompatible, yet specific and efficient as a
therapeutic strategy, it still requires the careful monitoring
of unwanted specific or nonspecific effects. On the basis of
the rather highly abundant delivery of miRNAs, any miRNA
replacement therapy will have to be tested for RISC saturation, competition with other endogenous miRNAs, or

Therapeutic PEI/miRNA Delivery

overstimulation of a given pathway. Notably, however, the
saturation of various cellular factors, which are required for
the processing of small RNAs and whose saturation can
result in lethal effects (44), is not an issue here because
chemically synthesized mature miRNAs do not require cellular processing prior to RISC incorporation. Thus, miRNAs
may provide better tools than DNA-based expression systems, as seen already in the case of small RNAs for gene
knockdown (45). Still, any off-target effects of miRNA delivery will have to be monitored in preclinical studies.
Although, in principal, nonspecific effects are rather unlikely
because the applied miRNA is identical to the physiologically
occurring one and is thus targeting the same mRNAs (as
opposed to siRNAs which do not have natural counterparts),
it has also been shown that off-target effects induced by
certain sequence motifs of synthetic RNAs can be dose
dependent (46). However, the literature on miRNA replacement approaches so far (5, 6, 8, 10), as well as our results
even after prolonged treatment, do not support adverse
effects. The fact that miRNAs exert only moderate effects
on their target genes and are already present and functional
under normal physiologic conditions may account for that.
This may be particularly true for unmodified miRNAs, which
are preferable because they preclude any potentially adverse
effects resulting from chemical modification. Even more,
however, this requires the development of powerful delivery
techniques like PEI complexation which work for unmodified miRNAs.
Taken together, the PEI-based therapeutic application of
unmodified miRNAs without any chemical modifications
combines several favorable properties: (i) the miRNAs are

identical to their naturally occurring counterparts (i.e., they
are not just "biosimilars," but "bioidenticals") and, simultaneously, (ii) they are easy to produce via chemical synthesis.
Previous studies (iii) have established the biocompatibility of
low molecular weight PEIs, which in their linear form are
already employed in clinical studies. The fact that (iv) no DNAbased expression constructs are employed, avoids safety
issues, for example, related to insertional mutagenesis upon
viral or nonviral delivery of DNAs or overloading of the cellular
dsRNA processing system, and (v) the ability of miRNAs to
target multiple oncogenic pathways predestines them for the
therapy of cancer as a "pathway disease" (47).
