High Basal Nuclear Levels of Nrf2 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
Reduces Sensitivity to Proteasome Inhibitors
Stuart A. Rushworth1, Kristian M. Bowles2, and David J. MacEwan1

Abstract
Proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib exhibit clinical efficacy in multiple myeloma, but studies in acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) have been disappointing to date. The apparent failure in AML likely reflects a lack of
biological understanding that might clarify applications of proteosome inhibitors in this disease. Here we show
that AML cells are considerably less sensitive than control noncancerous cells to bortezomib-induced
cytotoxicity, permitting most bortezomib-treated AML cells to survive treatment. We traced reduced bortezomib sensitivity to increased basal levels of nuclear Nrf2, a transcription factor that stimulates protective
antioxidant enzymes. Bortezomib stimulates cytotoxicity through accumulation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) but elevated basal levels of nuclear Nrf2 present in AML cells reduced ROS levels, permitting AML cells to
survive drug treatment. We further found that the Nrf2 transcriptional repressor Bach1 is rapidly inactivated by
bortezomib, allowing rapid induction of Nrf2-regulated cytoprotective and detoxification genes that protect
AML cells from bortezomib-induced apoptosis. By contrast, nonmalignant control cells lacked constitutive
activation of Nrf2, such that bortezomib-mediated inactivation of Bach1 led to a delay in induction of Nrf2regulated genes, effectively preventing the manifestation of apoptotic protection that is seen in AML cells.
Together, our findings argue that AML might be rendered sensitive to proteasome inhibitors by cotreatment
with either an Nrf2-inhibitory or Bach1-inhibitory treatment, rationalizing a targeted therapy against AML.

Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) comprises a heterogeneous
group of clonal disorders of hematopoietic progenitors, showing genetic instability and characterized by proliferation and
differentiation of abnormal cells, causing accumulation of
immature myeloid cells in bone marrow and blood. Five-year
survival varies from 15% to 70% depending on clinical and
biological factors, with overall AML survival rates for all
patients diagnosed with the disease being less than 20% (1).
Furthermore, with 75% of patients diagnosed after the age of
60, current intensive therapeutic strategies are generally limited to a minority of younger, fitter patients. There is a
significant unmet need for better tolerated, more widely
applicable targeted anti-AML therapy (2).
Recently, a number of potential new systemic anticancer
therapies (SACT) have emerged that are targeted to specific
signaling pathways or cellular processes aimed at blocking

proliferation and inducing apoptosis (3). Many potential
SACTs are being evaluated but their roles, efficacies, and
modes of action as either single agents or combined with
other drugs are yet to be fully defined. One such pathway
which is being targeted is the ubiquitin-proteasome system
that controls protein turnover and many cellular processes,
including cell cycle, gene regulation, and oxidative stress
responses. NF-E2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factorkB (NF-kB) are 2 transcription factors regulated by the
ubiquitin-proteasome system (4, 5). Both NF-kB and Nrf2
activate survival pathways known to play important roles
in protecting malignant cells from SACT cytotoxicity (6, 7).
AML cells show aberrant or constitutive NF-kB activation (8),
with a central step being phosphorylation and proteasomedependent degradation of its inhibitory proteins (IkBs), possible targets for proteasome inhibitors in aberrant elevated
NF-kB found in certain cancers.
The role of Nrf2 in AML-resistance to proteasome inhibition
has not been investigated. Nrf2 functions to rapidly change the
sensitivity of a cell's environment to oxidants and electrophiles by stimulating the transcriptional activation of over a
hundred cytoprotective genes, including antioxidants ferritin,
glutathione-S-reductase (GSR), and glutamyl cysteine ligase
modulator (GCLM) and catalytic (GCLC), phase I drug oxidation enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and
cytoprotective enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) genes (9).
With respect to HO-1, other transcription factors including
NF-kB and AP-1 are also involved in its expression (10–12).
Under normal physiologic conditions, the inhibitor of Nrf2,

Keap1, mediates ubiquitin-26S proteasomal degradation of
Nrf2. Oxidative and electrophilic stresses such as reactive
oxygen species (ROS) or SACTs, impairs Keap1-mediated
proteasomal degradation of Nrf2, causing Nrf2 activation
and subsequent nuclear translocation (10). Nuclear Nrf2 forms
a heterodimer complex with Maf proteins which bind the
antioxidant response element (ARE) located in the enhancer
regions of Nrf2-inducible genes. Therefore, side effects of
proteasome inhibition may be increased cellular Nrf2 leading
to its activation, and upregulation of cytoprotective proteins.
However, a regulatory process exists to control nuclear Nrf2
activation in the form of the transcriptional repressor Bach1,
bound to ARE enhancer regions in cells naïve to oxidative
stress to block Nrf2 binding. Bach1 becomes deactivated and
translocates to the cytosol, upon pro-oxidant stimuli (13).
We recently showed in AML that high basal NF-kB levels
regulate expression of HO-1 and that upon NF-kB inhibition,
HO-1 levels increase and protect AML cells from apoptosis via
inhibition of ROS formation (12). This study was undertaken
to define the role of HO-1 and Nrf2 in response to the only
clinically approved proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib. Bortezomib is already used for effective treatment of multiple
myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma and is well tolerated
clinically. With regards to AML, a small number of clinical
trials have been conducted with proteasome inhibitors revealing relatively disappointing results (14–16). The present studies were undertaken to investigate the mechanism by which
treating AML with proteasome inhibitors alone is ineffective.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
THP-1 cells were treated as described (12) before chromatin
was immunoprecipitated with IgG, anti-Nrf2, or anti-Bach1
(Abcam) antisera. Association of Nrf2 and Bach1 was measured by PCR using primers spanning the ARE-site located at
-4100 50 -TTTGCTGAGTCACCAGTGC-30 (forward), 50 TAAAGCTGCCCTTTCACCTC-30 (reverse) and was conducted
in triplicate on immunoprecipitated and input DNA.

Materials and Methods
Materials
AML-derived cell lines THP-1 and HL60 were obtained from
ECACC where they are authenticated by DNA-fingerprinting.
In the laboratory they are used at low passage number for a
maximum of 6 months postresuscitation, testing regularly for
Mycoplasma infection. Antibodies were sourced from Assay
Designs (HO-1), Abcam (Bach1), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (all
others). Control, HO-1, Nrf2, Bach1, and Keap1 siRNA were
from Applied Biosystems. Dead cells were removed from
samples using Dead-Cert Nanoparticles. Other reagents were
from Sigma-Aldrich unless indicated.
Cell culture
Primary AML cells were obtained under local ethical
approval (LREC ref 07/H0310/146). For primary cell isolation
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocytes
were isolated from healthy donors as described (12). Selection
of human hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from PBMCs
using a CD34þ selection kit (Miltenyi Biotec). For all experiments at least 3 different donors were used to obtain the
results presented. AML samples, less than 80% blasts expressing CD34, were purified using the CD34þ selection kit. Cell
type was confirmed by microscopy and flow cytometry.
RNA extraction and real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from 5  105 cells using the
Nucleic acid PrepStation from Applied Biosystems, according

Western immunoblotting, binding assay, and flow
cytometry
SDS-PAGE and Western analyses were done as described
(17). Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared as
described (18). Flow cytometry for measuring apoptosis
was carried out on an Accuri-C6 flow cytometer. A dichlorofluorescein (DCF) assay was used to determine cellular ROS
generation in AML cells (19, 20).
Transfections
Cells (1  106/well) were transfected by Amaxa Nucleofector,
with equivalent molar concentrations of siRNAs (30 nmol/L

Removal of nonviable cells from test samples
A total of 5  106 cells mixed with 25 mL of Dead-Cert
nanoparticles (30 minutes) had bound dead cells removed by
magnetic separation. Viable cells were then ready for RNA/
protein extraction.
Proliferation/death assays
Cells were treated with different doses of bortezomib then
viable numbers measured with MTS one-solution assay (Promega; 1 hour) before reading absorbance at 490 nmol/L.

allowed to grow for 24 hours. Cells were then incubated with
bortezomib for up to 24 hours. Intracellular glutathione levels
were quantified using the bioluminescent GSH-Glo glutathione assay (Promega).

Student's t test was conducted. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant (*). Results represent mean  SEMs of
3 independent experiments. For Western blotting experiments, data are representative of 3 independent experiments.

Results
AML cell sensitivity to proteasome inhibition
To understand the mechanism by which AML cells resist
apoptosis in response to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
(21–23), we analyzed the response of AML patient samples
(Table 1), AML cell lines and nonmalignant control cells to
increasing concentrations of bortezomib. Figure 1A shows the
IC50 values comparing AML cells and nonmalignant control
cells. We observe significant cell death in all samples in response
to bortezomib; however, IC50 values for AML samples range
between 5 and 71 nmol/L with control nonmalignant CD34þ
cells having IC50s between 11 and 16 nmol/L and primary
monocytes have IC50s of 4–6 nmol/L. The mean IC50s for
bortezomib was significantly lower in noncancerous cell types
versus AML (8.8  2.0 vs. 26.3  3.9 nmol/L, means  SEM,

n ¼ 6 and 19, respectively; P ¼ 0.02). Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 1 examines the time response (0–72 hours) of
AML and control cells to 25 nmol/L of bortezomib. This figure
shows that bortezomib does not induce apoptosis in all AML
cells with a large percentage of AML cells surviving even at 72
hours treatment (30%–35%), unlike nonmalignant cells (<5%).
Control cells also undergo apoptosis earlier than AML cells.
Bortezomib induces cytoprotective and detoxification
gene expression in AML cells
A potential role for antioxidant behavior (24, 25) of bortezomib was investigated. Under normal physiologic conditions,
Keap1 mediates the ubiquitin-26S proteasome–mediated
degradation of Nrf2 (10, 26) and regulates redox-sensitive
activation of Nrf2 (26, 27). As the generation of ROS is now
considered to be the early critical event for initiation of
bortezomib-induced apoptosis in some cancer cells (28, 29),
the role of bortezomib in regulating Nrf2-mediated gene
induction was examined. Figure 2 shows that bortezomib
significantly induces a number of Nrf2-regulated genes,
namely, the antioxidants ferritin, GSR, and GCLM, the phase
I drug oxidation enzyme NQO1, and also the cytoprotective
enzyme HO-1. Interestingly, bortezomib did not induce cytoprotection or detoxification genes in nonmalignant control
CD34þ cells. Given the extent to which bortezomib induces
AML cytoprotective genes, any number of genes could protect
AML cells from bortezomib-induced apoptosis.

Bortezomib induces stabilization and subsequent
activation of Nrf2 in AML
As bortezomib induced the expression of cytoprotective
and detoxification genes regulated by Nrf2 in AML cells,
subcellular localization of Nrf2 was examined in response to
bortezomib. Indications of Nrf2 activation include protein
accumulation and nuclear localization in activated cells,
therefore we examined Nrf2 protein expression levels in
both whole cell extracts and cytosolic versus nuclear
extracts in response to bortezomib in AML cells. Figure

3A shows that bortezomib induces Nrf2 protein expression
in whole cell extracts from THP-1 cells and that levels
remain stable up to 72 hours. Moreover, examination of
cytosolic and nuclear fractions showed Nrf2 localized in the
nucleus in response to bortezomib (Fig. 3A). To determine if
Nrf2 was responsible for activation of HO-1 in response to
bortezomib in AML cells, we used siRNA to silence Nrf2
expression. Supplementary Figure 2 shows that THP-1 transfected cells with siRNA exhibit Nrf2 knockdown. Figure 3B
shows bortezomib treatment of Nrf2-silenced AML cells

inhibits HO-1 expression compared with control siRNAtreated AML cells.
In our previous study we also observed some nuclear
expression of Nrf2 in unactivated THP-1 cells (27). To address
the importance of this finding we wanted to determine the
extent to which primary AML cells and control cells had
nuclear expression of Nrf2. Figure 3C (also Supplementary
Fig. 3) shows AML samples with higher bortezomib-resistance
(Fig. 1A) possess nuclear expression of Nrf2, which is not true
of control cells or bortezomib-sensitive AML cells. Finally, we
examined if silencing Nrf2 or HO-1 could induce apoptosis in
AML cells that are resistant to bortezomib. When we knocked
down Nrf2 in AML cell line THP-1, AML306, and human
monocytes (Fig. 3D) we showed that bortezomib then induced
a significantly greater apoptotic response in THP-1 and primary AML blasts. Knockdown of Nrf2 allowed bortezomib to
kill off almost all AML cells. Thus, Nrf2 knockdown reveals the
full apoptotic potential of bortezomib in AML. Unlike Nrf2,
silencing of HO-1 did not allow full bortezomib-induced AML
death to be revealed (Supplementary Fig. 4) with additional
NF-kB inhibition possibly also needed (12) in regard to
bortezomib-induced AML death. These findings show that
basal nuclear Nrf2 is responsible for protecting AML cells from
bortezomib-induced apoptosis and the mechanism by which
Nrf2 is protecting AML cells is via combined upregulation of
cytoprotective and detoxifying genes, and not directly
mediated through HO-1.
Bortezomib inhibits Bach1/ARE in AML paving the way
for Nrf2 activation
To further understand the significance of constitutive
nuclear Nrf2 activity in AML cells, we analyzed the expression
of the Nrf2 transcriptional repressor Bach1. Figure 4A shows
that Bach1 nuclear expression is virtually unchanged between
control and AML samples, suggesting that Bach1 is repressing
the nuclear Nrf2 seen in bortezomib-resistant AML samples
from binding to the ARE and switching on ARE-regulated
genes. To determine if bortezomib can induce Bach1 nuclear

export in to the cytoplasm we examined cytosolic and nuclear
expression of Bach1 in response to 25 nmol/L bortezomib over
24 hours. Figure 4B shows that nuclear Bach1 levels decreased
at the same time that cytosolic Bach1 levels increased in
response to bortezomib. We next examined the in vivo relevance of Nrf2 and Bach1 in regulating HO-1 expression in AML
cells in response to bortezomib. We evaluated the effect of
bortezomib on recruitment of Bach1 and Nrf2 to the HO-1
ARE promoter site. Figure 4C shows real-time PCR (gel panel)
and PCR analysis (bar graph) of the levels of Bach1 and Nrf2 at
the ARE. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis
revealed recruitment of Bach1 was markedly decreased at
the ARE from 1 hour bortezomib treatment (Fig. 4C). In
contrast Nrf2 binding to ARE over the same time, was markedly greater with bortezomib treatment. Finally, to determine
if Bach1 is repressing cytoprotective gene induction in AML
cells that have nuclear expression of Nrf2, we used siRNA to
knockdown Bach1 expression in 2 AML samples, 1 with low
normal nuclear Nrf2 (AML303) and 1 with high nuclear Nrf2
(AML307). Supplementary Figure 2 shows that we can knockdown Bach1 protein effectively in AML cells. Figure 4D shows
that Bach1-knockdown induced expression of cytoprotective
genes HO-1, NQO1, GCLM, and GSR in AML307 (bortezomibresistant) but not AML303 (bortezomib-sensitive). Furthermore, we also examined HL60 and THP-1 cell response to
Bach1-knockdown and as a positive control Keap1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 5). Again this showed that Bach1knockdown induced expression of HO-1, NQO1, GCLM, and
GSR in THP-1 (bortezomib-resistant) but not bortezomibsensitive HL60s. Keap1-knockdown showed that these genes
could be induced in HL60 as well as THP-1 cells. Taken
together these results suggest that under normal basal conditions in AML Bach1 prevents nuclear Nrf2 binding to the
ARE to induce cytoprotective genes. However, upon bortezomib treatment, Bach1 quickly detaches from the ARE, is
exported from the nucleus, and the high basal Nrf2 causes
immediate upregulation of cytoprotective genes, thus protecting AML from bortezomib-induced apoptosis.

Bortezomib induces ROS to activate Nrf2 and Bach1,
protecting AML from apoptosis
As Keap1 regulates redox-sensitive activation of Nrf2 (26),
and ROS are considered critical in bortezomib-induced effects
in some cancer cell lines (28, 29), the role of ROS was examined
here in AML. In response to bortezomib treatment, ROS
generation occurred in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5A).
ROS activation kinetics correlate with nuclear accumulation
of Nrf2 following bortezomib (Fig. 3B). Moreover, we observed
a secondary decrease in ROS levels in bortezomib-resistant

AML cells (AML217, AML306, THP-1), apparent 2–8 hours
after treatment, that was not observed in more bortezomibsensitive cells (CD34þ, AML303, AML205; Fig. 5A). Comparing
these data, there are 2 clear groupings: (i) those cells sensitive
to bortezomib and without a secondary reduction in ROS
levels; and (ii) cells that are insensitive to bortezomib with a
substantial secondary reduction in ROS levels. Next we examined the role of Nrf2 in regulating ROS levels in AML cells.
Figure 5B shows that if we inhibit Nrf2 expression and
activation using an Nrf2 siRNA., in AML306 and THP-1 cells

we get the same initial increase in ROS but no decrease as is
seen with the control siRNA (Nrf2 knockdown AML303 cells
showed no change in secondary ROS). This suggests that
activation of the high basal Nrf2 and its subsequent cytoprotective gene induction reduces the amount of cellular ROS
created by bortezomib, and thus protecting AML cells against
apoptosis. Finally we determined if ROS were responsible for
regulation of Nrf2 and Bach1 in response to bortezomib.
Figure 5C shows that the ROS quencher N-acetyl cysteine
(NAC) inhibited the bortezomib increase of nuclear Nrf2 in
resistant AML cells, but with sensitive AML or human monocytes, bortezomib did not induce a Nrf2 response in these
cells. NAC also inhibited bortezomib-induced export of
nuclear Bach1 in resistant cells. No effect was observed in
bortezomib-sensitive or human monocytes, as subcellular
redistribution of Nrf2 or Bach1 was not seen in response to
bortezomib. Figure 5D shows that NAC inhibited bortezomibinduced Nrf2 gene induction in resistant cells but not sensitive

from this study which shows that bortezomib induces glutathione rate-limiting enzymes in resistant cells, we examined
intracellular glutathione response to bortezomib in THP-1
(bortezomib-resistant) and HL60 (bortezomib-sensitive). Supplementary Figure 6 shows that intracellular glutathione
reduced in HL60 and increased in THP-1 cells in response
to bortezomib over a 24-hour time period.

this study we showed that normal myeloid cells (including
CD34þ HSC and primary monocytes) have lower IC50s to
bortezomib than the majority of AML samples tested. We
showed in AML cells that having IC50s greater than control
cells (i.e. bortezomib-resistant) that cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2 is not only induced by bortezomib, but is
already in their nucleus and therefore primed for activation.
Moreover, we observe that bortezomib induces nuclear export
of Nrf2 repressor Bach1, through a ROS-dependent mechanism. Altogether, these signals trigger rapid induction of cytoprotective and detoxification genes, including HO-1, NQO1,
GCLM, and GRS, that combine to act to protect AML cells
from bortezomib-induced apoptosis.
Interestingly, other proteasomal inhibitors like MG132 preferentially induce apoptosis in AML cells over nonmalignant
control cells (31). However, peptidyl aldehydes such as MG132
are less specific than bortezomib as they inhibit serine/
cysteine proteases in addition to the proteasome, with poorer
stability and bioavailability (32), and therefore are less likely to
become clinically useful. Bacterial product lactacystin is more
proteasome-specific, however irreversibly blocks several proteasomal proteolytic activities, whereas bortezomib reversibly
inhibits more the chymotrypsin-like activities. These unique
features of bortezomib make it easier to administer in an in
vivo setting and result in its decreased toxicity. However, as we
and others have discovered, using better targeted proteasome
inhibitors like bortezomib leads to no preferential apoptosis in
AML cells over control cells (14, 15, 22). We show here that
bortezomib preferentially induced apoptosis in control cells
over AML cells, making it less likely to be used to treat AML.
Other studies have also shown unexpected results when using
bortezomib, for instance Bil and colleagues showed bortezomib preferentially induced CD20 in normal B cells compared
with a decrease in malignant B cells, and this differential CD20
expression led to a significant increase in rituximab-mediated
complement-dependent cytotoxicity in normal B cells (33).
With increasing interest in inhibiting the ubiquitin-proteosome system, better targeted proteasome inhibitors are being
clinically developed. We need to understand the specific
pathways protecting AML cells and other cancer cells from
such drugs.

The role of Nrf2 has been intensively studied showing that
Nrf2 activation protects against many human diseases or
pathologic states, such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases,
aging, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute pulmonary injury (7, 34–39). Using dietary or
synthetic compounds to boost Nrf2-mediated cellular defense
responses to prevent disease has been intensively studied (40–
44). Many Nrf2 activators have been identified and their
efficacy in cancer prevention has been verified both in animal
models and in human clinical trials (40, 45). Here, we provide a
different perspective, one where the activation of Nrf2 protects
cancer cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to a SACT,
bortezomib. We show that many AML samples have nuclear
Nrf2, and therefore are primed for the activation of the ARE.
The transcriptional repressor Bach1 prevents Nrf2 activation
but with the addition of bortezomib (which induces a prooxidant state) this induces Bach1 to disassociate from the
ARE, allowing Nrf2 to bind the ARE and induce transcription
of Nrf2-regulated genes. The experiment described in Figure
4D shows that siRNA knockdown of Bach1 induces expression
of HO-1, NQO1, GCLM, and GSR in AML307 but not AML303.
We believe the reason for this to be related to the presence of
nuclear Nrf2 in AML307 (but not AML303) thus allowing
activation at the ARE. The role of Bach1 compared with
the more expected Keap1 (46, 47) to repress ARE gene
transcription is less clear, as some studies show conflicting
data regarding specific genes repressed by Bach1. For example, knockdown of Bach1 induced HO-1 but not NQO1, with
the data for GCLM, GCLC, and GSR being less clear. Here we
show that knockdown of Bach1 or Keap1 are both as equally
influential over the expression of these antioxidant genes in
AML cells (Supplementary Fig. 5). Bach1 can compete at the
ARE with Nrf2 in the NQO1 promoter. Taken together, silencing of only Bach1 would have no effect on NQO1 expression,
but observing any change requires additional Nrf2 activation,
such as we observe here in resistant AML samples (AML307,
THP-1) compared with more sensitive AML samples (AML303,
HL60).
Our understanding of the sequence of events leads us to
conclude that AML cells that have basal nuclear expression of
Nrf2 are more likely to be resistant to bortezomib-induced
death and possibly other SACT (Fig. 6). Interestingly, Nrf2 can
modulate expression of alpha and beta subunits of the 26S
proteasome, however, we showed no obvious change in proteasomal subunits expression patterns between bortezomibresistant and -sensitive AML cells (Supplementary Fig. 7).
Moreover, based on these observations, the identification of
small molecules that potently and specifically inhibit the Nrf2dependent response or prevent ROS-dependent Bach1 activation would be extremely important in increasing the efficacy
of new and existing proteasomal inhibitors for therapeutic
applications, particularly in AML.
One of the main questions to be raised by this study is why
is Nrf2 constitutively active in some but not all AML cells and
not in control cells? This is not the first time that Nrf2 has
been shown to be constitutively active in human cancer cells
(45, 48). In human lung cancer tissues and lung carcinoma
lines, mutation in the inhibitor of Nrf2, Keap1, inactivated its

repressor function causing Nrf2 activation as showed by
elevated Nrf2 protein levels, Nrf2 nuclear localization, and
increased mRNA expression of Nrf2 target genes. Moreover,
Nrf2 was found to be increased in 91.5% of tumors from
patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, plus
abnormally elevated Nrf2 protein levels were observed in
pancreatic cancer tissues and cell lines, resulting in their
increased drug resistance (49). Therefore, it is highly likely
that cancer cells acquire growth advantage during the course
of transformation by either eliminating any Keap1-mediated
negative control of Nrf2, or by increasing Nrf2 protein levels to
the point which Keap1 is saturated, subsequently leading to
better activation of Nrf2-dependent defense responses.
Further work to determine why Nrf2 is abnormally high in
AML is underway, as understanding this mechanism may pave
the way to developing combinational therapies for the treatment of AML.
Our results clearly indicate that the Nrf2-dependent defense
response helps survival of AML cells during treatment with
bortezomib. It is also clear that Nrf2-dependent protection
accounts for drug sensitivity of AML cells to bortezomib. Drug
sensitivity to SACT is the major obstacle to the successful
treatment of many cancers including neuroblastoma, breast
cancers, and lung cancers. In the course of SACT, a strong
initial response is frequently followed by the appearance of
drug-resistant variants. Moreover, many genes reported to
play roles in drug sensitivity seemingly have functional links
with Nrf2. For instance, Nrf2 is a key regulator of phase IIdetoxifying enzyme NQO1. In addition, Nrf2 regulates many of
the key enzymes important in maintaining cellular redox

homeostasis, such as GCLC and GCLM, which are the ratelimiting enzymes controlling glutathione biosynthesis. Moreover, GSR facilitates the reduction of glutathione disulfide to
the sulfhydryl form of glutathione. Therefore, as Nrf2 regulates
many genes including HO-1 to provide reduced sensitivity
toward proteasomal inhibition, targeting Nrf2 may be more
effective than targeting any of these genes alone. In conclusion, our data show that inhibition of Nrf2 sensitizes cells to
proteasome inhibition, suggesting that Nrf2 inhibitors may be
used concomitantly to increase the efficacy of anticancer
therapy.
