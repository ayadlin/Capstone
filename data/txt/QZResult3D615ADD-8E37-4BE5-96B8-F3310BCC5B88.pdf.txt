ABSTRACT
Glioblastomas respond differently to all-trans retinoic acid (RA) for unknown
reasons. Because CRABP-II and FABP5 mediate RA intracellular signaling respectively
and lead to distinct biological consequences, their expression patterns in different
grades of astrocytomas and the glioblastoma cells lines LN18, LN428 and U251 were
examined to identify potential correlations with RA sensitivities. The response of
glioblastoma cells to RA, decitabine or the FABP5 competitive inhibitor, BMS309403,
was analyzed. CRABP-II and FABP5 were expressed to varying degrees by the
84-astrocytoma cases examined. Treatment of LN428, U251 and LN18 cells with
RA failed to suppress their growth; however, U251 proliferation was inhibited by
decitabine. The combination of decitabine and RA suppressed the growth of all three
cell lines and induced significant apoptosis of LN428 and U251 cells. Both CRABP-II and
FABP5 were transcribed in the three cell lines but FABP5 proteins were undetectable
in U251 cells. The ratio of CRABP-II to FABP5 was not altered after RA, decitabine
or RA and decitabine treatment and the resistance of cells to RA was not reversed
by BMS309403 treatment. In conclusion, CRABP-II and FABP5 expression patterns
are neither related to the tumor grades nor correlated with RA sensitivity. Additional
molecular factors may be present that determines the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells
to RA. Dicitabine may improve the sensitivity of glioblastoma cells to RA, however,
its underlying mechanism and its in vivo feasibility need to be investigated.

INTRODUCTION

As a natural derivative of vitamin A, all-trans
retinoic acid (RA) regulates multiple biological processes,
including growth suppression of certain normal and
malignant cells [9-12]. RA is able to inhibit the growth of
promyelocytes and medulloblastoma cells by promoting
their differentiation and apoptosis [13, 14]. However, in
other cancers, RA appears to promote rather than inhibit
cell survival. For example, RA can promote cell survival
and growth of NaF mammary tumor cells of the MMTVneu mouse [15] and enhance skin tumor formation [16].
The data concerning the biological effects of RA on human
glioblastoma cells are controversial. Some studies have
demonstrated a therapeutic benefit of RA in the treatment
of human glioblastomas [17], whereas, other studies found

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most
aggressive and common brain malignancy in adults [1].
Because of the difficulty in removing the tumor radically,
the therapeutic outcome of GBM is very poor. Current
treatment consists of surgery with radiotherapy and/or
chemotherapy, however, the average survival of GBM
patients is only 12-15 months [2-5]. Evidence indicates
that GBM responds differently to anticancer drugs and
intensive adjuvant treatments usually lead to local and
systemic damage to the patients [6-8]. Understanding the
mechanisms of GBM cell chemoresistance would be of
significant clinical value.

that retinoids failed to inhibit proliferation and migration
of human glioblastoma cells [18]. In addition, RA has
been demonstrated to enhance the transcription of a group
of cancer-associated genes in glioblastoma cells [19].
Nevertheless, the cause of different RA sensitivities in
glioblastoma cells is unknown.
RA can signal via two classical pathways, mediated
by CRABP-II or FABP5, which result in distinct cellular
responses [15]. CRABP-II delivers RA from the cytosol
to nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARs), which associate
with retinoid X receptor (RXRs) to form heterodimers.
These complexes bind to regulatory regions of specific
target genes, leading to differentiation, cell-cycle arrest
and apoptosis [9-12, 15]. Conversely, the RA signal
mediated by the FABP5/PPAR pathway may promote
cancer cell survival by activating some cancer-associated
genes [19, 20]. An imbalanced ratio of CRABP-II and
FABP5 may determine RA sensitivities of cancer cells
[15]. This notion is supported by research in human
medulloblastoma cells, as the RA-resistance of CRABP-IInegative UW228-2 and UW228-3 medulloblastoma cells
can be reversed via restoration of CRABP-II expression.
In addition, Med-3 cells become RA-resistant when their
CRABP-II expression is specifically blocked [13]. Because
glioblastoma cells also show different RA sensitivities [17,
18, 21-23], it is possible that their response to RA may
be similar to that of medulloblastoma cells. To determine
this, the statuses of CRABP-II and FABP5 mediated-RA
signaling and their correlations with RA sensitivities were
investigated using three glioblastoma cell lines.

microarray-based immunohistochemical staining. CRABP
II and FABP5 were expressed differently within the fourastrocytoma grades (Table 1). CRABP II and FABP5 were
expressed, respectively, in 58.3% (7/12) and 75% (9/12)
of grade I astrocytomas, 86.7% (26/30) and 63.3% (19/30)
of Grade II, 64.5% (20/31) and 71% (22/31) of Grade
III, and 63.6% (7/11) and 45.5% (5/11) in Grade IV. The
staining patterns or labeling densities of CRABP-II and
FABP5 in the four grades of astrocytomas were analyzed
and compared with their surrounding noncancerous
counterparts (Figure 1A). The surrounding tissues were
positive for CRABP-II but negative for FABP5 (Figure
1A). The four staining patterns of CRABP-II and FABP5
were observed among glioblastomas: CRABP-II-/FABP5, CRABP-II-/FABP5+, CRABP-II+/FABP5- and CRABPII+/FABP5+ and the respective profiles were expressed by
18% (2/11), 18% (2/11), 37% (4/11) and 27% (3/11) of the
glioblastomas (Figure 1B).

RA-resistant properties of LN18, LN428 and
U251 cells
The effects of RA on the three human glioblastoma
cells were evaluated by continuously treating them with
10 μM of RA for 72 h. Hematoxylin and eosin staining
revealed no obvious morphological changes among the
RA-treated cells in comparison with the normally cultured
or 0.2% DMSO treated cells (Figure 2A). An MTT assay
(Figure 2B) on RA treated LN428 cells indicated a 20.9%
reduced cell viability compared to untreated cells and
a 14% reduction compared with DMSO treated cells.
U251 cells treated with RA for 48 h displayed a 10.8%
reduced cell viability compared with untreated cells and
4.2% compared with DMSO treated cells. No statistical
significance was identified for LN428 (p=0.093) or for
U251 cells (p=0.18). In comparison with the number of
cells in the untreated LN18 cells, 0.2% DMSO reduced the
population by 4.2% (p=0.118) and 48 h of RA treatment
increased the population by 2.6%. Flow cytometry
analysis demonstrated that the cell cycle fractions of
LN18, LN428 and U251 cells were similar when untreated
or treated with 10 μM of RA. Furthermore, apoptosis was
infrequent in each of the experimental groups (Figure 2C).

Detection of CRABP-II in the three-glioblastoma
cell lines

Variable CRABP-II and FABP5 ratios among
glioblastoma cell lines

Immunocytochemical staining showed that the
levels of CRABP-II expression in LN18, LN428 and U251
cells were almost identical between the untreated and
the RA-treated cells (Figure 3A). Accordingly, RT-PCR
and western blot analyses revealed that CRABP-II was
expressed in LN18, LN428 and U251 cells and its levels
remained unchanged following RA treatment (Figure 3B).

Based on the RT-PCR and western blot results,
the ratios of CRABP-II and FABP5 were calculated at
the transcriptional and translational levels. It was found
that the ratio of CRABP-II to FABP5 transcripts were 2.6
in LN18, 0.85 in LN428 and 1.08 in U251 cells, which
showed little change (2.43, 0.64 and 1.13, respectively)
after RA treatment (Figure 3B). The ratio of CRABP-II to
FABP5 proteins were 1.17 and 0.74 in untreated LN18 and
LN428 cells, respectively, and 1.03 and 0.65, respectively,
following RA treatment. Because FABP5 protein was not
detected in U251 cells, CRABP-II was the predominant
protein.

Differential FABP5 expression patterns in the
three-glioblastoma cells
According to the results of RT-PCR, ICC and
western blot analyses, FABP5 was expressed in LN18
and LN428 cells and the levels were not changed after RA
treatment. FABP5 RT-PCR products could be generated
in low levels from U251 cell RNA, in the presence or
absence of RA treatment, but the FABP5 protein was
undetectable (Figure 3A and 3B). These results are
supported by a previous study [24]. DNA sequencing
confirmed that the 281 bp RT-PCR product was amplified
with FABP5 primers and was specifically generated from
FABP5 transcripts, which encompassed Exon 1 to Exon 3
(data not shown).

RA up-regulated CYP26A1 expression
The catabolic enzyme CYP26A1, which is essential
for RA catabolism, is known to promote RA degradation
and extracellular elimination [25]. The results of RT-PCR
revealed that expression of CYP26A1 was up-regulated
following RA treatment (Figure 4). This indicates that
the cellular response to exogenous RA is to increase
CYP26A1 expression and thereby induce RA catabolism.

of LN428 cells, RA treatment slightly increased RARβ
expression, while the levels of PPARδ and other RA
nuclear receptors were unchanged. PPARγ expression in
LN18 and LN428 cells was unchanged after RA treatment,
but was slightly down-regulated in U251 cells after RA
treatment.

Because of the importance of the nuclear RA
receptors, PPARδ and PPARγ, in mediating RA target
gene transcription, their expression patterns in the three
cell lines were examined before and after RA treatment.
RT-PCR revealed that RARs, RXRs and PPARδ were
expressed in all three cell lines, although the level of
RARβ expression was low, especially in LN428 cells
(Figure 4). In RA-treated LN18 and U251 cells, RARα,
RARγ, RXRs and PPARδ expression levels remained
stable, while RARβ was clearly up-regulated. In the case

another 48 h (Figure 5A) [26]. The results revealed that
decitabine directly suppressed proliferation of U251 cells
by 30.7%, but it had little effect on LN18 and LN428 cells
(Figure 5B and 5C). The effect of the combined decitabine
and RA treatment on the three cell lines varied. The
combined treatment for 48 h could suppress the growth of
LN18, LN428 and U251 cells by 31.1% (p=0.001), 32.9%
(p=0.002) and 77.1% (p=0.001), respectively (Figure 5C).
Flow cytometry analyses showed that decitabine and RA
combined treatment led to increased apoptosis of LN428
by 15% and U251 cells by 17.6%. Although apoptosis
was not increased in LN18 cells, a significant proportion
were arrested in the G1 phase (73.8%), while cells in the
G2 phase were undetectable (Figure 5D). In addition,
a TUNEL assay identified frequent apoptotic death in
LN428 and U251 cells treated with decitabine and RA
(Figure 5B).

To determine the effect of FABP5 inhibition on the
RA resistant features of LN18, LN428 and U251 cells,
BMS309403, a competitive inhibitor of FABP5 [28, 29],
was used to treat glioblastoma cells prior to RA treatment.
Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed no obvious
morphological changes among the cells pretreated for 6
h with BMS309403 before RA treatment, when compared
to untreated cells and cells treated with RA only (Figure
7A). The results from cell counting showed similar
growth speeds between the RA-treated glioblastoma
cells and the cells treated with BMS309403 before RA
treatment (Figure 7B). In addition, the percent of viable
cells after 72 h of culture in the untreated, RA treated and
BMS309403 and RA treated groups were 97%, 96.8%
and 96%, respectively, for LN18 cells; 98%, 97.2% and
97.8%, respectively, for LN428 cells; 98%, 96% and
96.2%, respectively, for U251 cells. These results suggest
that BMS309403 failed to reverse RA resistance among
glioblastoma cells.

Differential responses of RA-related elements to
decitabine
RT-PCR and western blotting showed that neither
CRABP-II nor FABP5 was up-regulated in LN18 and
LN428 cells after decitabine or decitabine and RA
treatment (Figure 6A and 6B). In the case of U251
cells, CRABP-II expression was relatively stable, while
FABP5 was only detectable in the transcriptional rather
than translational level after decitabine or decitabine and
RA treatment (Figure 6B). Consequently, the CRABPII/FABP5 ratios in three cell lines were not apparently
altered after RA, decitabine or their combined treatments
(Figure 6A and 6B). The expression level of RARβ
remained stable after decitabine treatment and was upregulated with the combined treatment in LN18 and U251
cells. RARβ expression was increased in LN428 cells after
decitabine treatment and decitabine and RA combined
treatment. PPARγ expression was up-regulated in LN18,
LN428 and U251 cells after decitabine treatment, but
was almost unchanged after decitabine and RA treatment.
The expression of CYP26A1 remained unchanged after
decitabine treatment but was up-regulated after decitabine
and RA treatment in LN18 and LN428 cells. CYP26A1
expression was increased in U251 cells treated with
decitabine and the combined treatment (Figure 6A).
OLFM4 is known as a target of RA and the activation of
OLFM4 may contribute to the therapeutic effect of RA
[27]. The expression of OLFM4 in the three cell lines, with
or without RA treatment, was therefore examined by RTPCR. OLFM4 was up-regulation in LN18 and U251 cells
by both RA treatment and decitabine and RA combined
treatment, but only extremely low levels were detected in
LN428 cells irrespective of the treatment (Figure 6A).

DISCUSSION
The effect of RA on human glioblastomas has
been intensively investigated, with the aim of finding a
method to improve the therapeutic outcome of this lethal
malignancy [17, 18, 21-23]. However, the data obtained
are controversial. Some reports demonstrate that RA
exhibits a heterogeneous growth-inhibitory activity against
human glioblastoma cells by modulation of EGF receptor
phosphotyrosine kinase activity [30, 31]. However, a
body of evidence has revealed frequent RA resistance
among glioblastoma tumors and cell lines [18, 21, 22].
As demonstrated in the current study, the three cell lines
examined were resistant (LN18) or insensitive (LN428 and
U251) to RA, and treatment caused little morphological
alternation, very low apoptosis frequencies and unchanged
growth rates. Moreover, RA-treated LN18 cells grew
more rapidly. Given these data, it is necessary to explore
the molecular mechanism underlying the different RA
sensitivities to enable reliable application of RA for the
treatment of glioblastomas.
There are two well-characterized RA signal
transduction pathways that are mediated by CRABP-II
and by FABP5. Because the biological consequences of
these two pathways are distinct, the expression levels of
CRABP-II and FABP5 may determine the RA sensitivities
and outcome of cancer cells treated with RA [15]. For
example, it was reported that the expression ratio of
FABP5 to CRABP-II was significantly higher in the tumor
tissues of short-term survivors compared to long-term
survivors. In addition, the expression of FABP5 protein
was increased in highly proliferating tumor cells [21]. For

this reason, CRABP-II and FABP5 expression patterns
and their ratios in different grades of astrocytomas were
profiled immunohistochemically. It was revealed that
CRABP-II and FABP5 were expressed in four forms as
CRABP-II-/FABP5-, CRABP-II-/FABP5+, CRABP-II+/
FABP5- and CRABP-II+/FABP5+ in the different grades
of astrocytomas and the expression was unrelated to the
tumor grade. According to the proposed functions of the
two classical RA signaling pathways [15] and our data
from human medulloblastoma cells [13], it was possible
that the distinct CRABP-II and FABP5 expression patterns
found randomly in the four grades of astrocytomas
might explain the variable RA sensitivities of individual
glioblastoma cases. This hypothesis was therefore tested
using LN-18, LN-428 and U251 cell lines.
The in vitro results showed that CRABP-II was
expressed in all three cell lines used and its levels remained
stable after RA treatment. FABP5 could be detected at
both RNA and protein levels in LN18 and LN428 cells,
while it was transcribed to mRNA but not translated to
protein in U251 cells. Consequently, the CRABP-II and
FABP5 ratios of the three RA-insensitive cell lines were
not identical. According to the findings from other types
of cancers, the cells with high CRABP-II expression tend
to be sensitive to RA treatment and cells with high FABP5
expression tend to be insensitive to RA treatment [9-12,
13, 32]. However, the results from this study contradict
these findings, as CRABP-II protein expression was 2.6fold higher than FABP5 in RA resistant LN18 cells and
the RA-insensitive U251 cells expressed CRABP-II in
the absence of FABP5. Because the major components of
CRABP-II and FABP5 expression did not correlate with
RA sensitivity, it is possible that CRABP-II and FABP5
are not the critical determinants of RA sensitivities in
glioblastoma cells. Therefore, our results suggest the
presence of additional mechanism related to the response
of glioblastoma cells to RA treatment.
Gene expression patterns can be modified by
epigenetic alterations, including DNA methylation.
Decitabine, a powerful DNA methylation eraser, has
therefore been increasingly used independently or in
combination with other agents in cancer therapy [26]. RA
and decitabine combination has been employed to treat
patients with leukemia, breast and thyroid cancers [27, 33,
34]. This treatment method can restore key RA signaling
pathways that enable cancer cells to become sensitive
to RA [13]. This strategy has been attempted on human
glioblastomas as well. One study found that 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine-treated primary cultured glioblastoma cells
showed CRABP-II up-regulation, which rendered them
more sensitive to RA treatment [22]. In the current study, a
similar treatment regimen was used to determine whether
the RA-resistant properties of the three glioblastoma cell
lines could be overcome. Although decitabine exerted
little effect on CRABP-II and FABP5 expression patterns,
it enhanced RA sensitivities of CRABP-II++/FABP5++
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

LN428 cells and CRABP-II++/FABP5- U251 cells in
terms of growth arrest and apoptosis. However, CRABPII++/FABP5+ LN18 cells were less sensitive to RA and
decitabine treatment, although significantly more cells
were in the G1 phase. These phenomena suggest that
CRABP-II and FABP5 levels or ratios are not associated
with the responsiveness of human glioblastoma cells
to RA. The failure of the three glioblastoma cells to
overcome RA resistance with the FABP5 competitive
inhibitor, BMS309403, further supports this notion.
Our findings using human glioblastoma cells contradict
the currently working hypothesis on RA sensitivity [13,
15] and indicate that the molecular mechanisms of RA
intracellular signaling and the cellular responses to RA are
more complicated than expected.
Current data has revealed that additional factors
are involved in regulation of RA sensitivity beyond the
classical pathways mediated by CRABP-II and by FABP5
[35]. OLFM4 is known as a novel target of RA and the
activation of OLFM4 may contribute to the therapeutic
value of RA [27]. However, the biological effects of
OLFM4 differ between the types of cancer. For instance,
it functions as an anti-apoptotic factor in pancreatic
cells by promoting S-phase transition [36] and it also
promotes metastasis of colon cancers [37]. In contrast,
OLFM4 overexpression leads HL-60 cells to growth
inhibition, differentiation and apoptosis [27]. Currently,
the expression pattern and the biological roles of OLFM4
in glioblastoma cells remain unknown. Our results clearly
reveal that the levels of OLFM4 expression are extremely
low in LN18, LN428 and U251 cells but are up-regulated
after RA and decitabine and RA treatments. Interestingly,
RA can up-regulate OLFM4 expression 3.38, 1.25 and
2.37 fold in RA-resistant LN18 cells and RA-insensitive
LN428 and U251 cells, respectively. These findings
demonstrate for the first time that RA promotes OLFM4
expression and suggests a potential favorable role of
OLFM4 in human glioblastoma cells.
Taken together, the current study demonstrates
variable expression patterns of CRABP-II and FABP5
among the four astrocytoma grades. LN18, LN428
and U251 glioblastoma cell lines are insensitive to RA
treatment irrespective to their CRABP-II and FABP5
expression statuses or FABP5 inhibition. The global
DNA demethylator decitabine can overcome RA
resistance or insensitivity of the three cell lines without
altering the levels of CRABP-II and FABP5 expression.
OLFM4 proteins might play anti-apoptotic roles in RAtreated glioblastoma cells but are not sufficient to rescue
decitabine-pretreated LN428 and U251 cells from RAinduced apoptosis. Because neither the CRABP-II- nor
the FABP5-mediated RA signaling pathway is the key
determinant of RA sensitivity in glioblastoma cells, it
would be worthwhile to search for other RA-related
factors that indicate RA sensitivity to enable reliable antiglioblastoma therapy. In addition, it would be necessary

and the cell-bearing coverslips were fixed in cold acetone
or 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for morphological,
immunocytochemical examinations and TUNEL assay.
The experimental groups were set in triplicate and the
experiments were repeated for three times to establish
confidential conclusion.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical
(IHC) staining
84 paraffin-embedded astrocytoma specimens
with various grades were collected from the First
Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University. This
study was approved by the hospital institution review
board and informed consent was obtained from all
patients. The expression patterns of CRABP-II and
FABP5 in different grades of astrocytomas were profiled
immunohistochemically, using paraffin sections of tissue
microarrays constructed in duplicate with 84 astrocytomas
and, where possible, noncancerous tumor surrounding
tissues [38]. The antibodies used were rabbit antihuman CRABP II and FABP5 (Proteintech, Chicago, IL,
USA) at dilutions of 1:100 and 1:80, respectively. Color
reaction was developed using 3, 3’-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride (DAB). The sections without the first
antibody incubation were used as the background control.
According to the labeling intensity, the staining results
were evaluated by two researchers, and scored as negative
(−) if no immunolabeling was observed in target cells,
weakly positive (+) if the labeling was faint, moderately
positive (++) if the labeling was stronger, and strongly
positive (+++) if the labeling was distinctly stronger than
(++) [39].

Cell proliferation and death assays
The effects of RA, DAC and DAC/RA
combination on cell proliferation were determined by
3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium
bromide/MTT assay [40]. The results were shown as
percentage of cell viability (OD of the experiment
samples/OD of the control) or OD values. Terminal
deoxynucleotide transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin
nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed on the
cell-bearing coverslips to detect apoptotic cells according
to producer’s instructions (Promega Corporation, USA).

Flow cytometry analysis
The harvested cells of the experimental groups
were fixed in ethanol for staining with DNA dye and resuspended in 0.5 ml to 1 ml propidium iodide (PI) solution
containing RNase and incubated at 37°C for 30 min.
Cell cycle profiles and the proportion of apoptotic cells
were determined with a FACS vantage Flow Cytometer
(Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA), and the data
were analyzed with MOD FIT software (Verity Software
House, Inc, Topsham, ME, USA).

Cell culture and treatments
Human glioblastoma LN18 and LN428 cell lines
were kindly provided by Professor Nicolas de Tribolet,
Department of Neurosurgery, Central Hospital University
of Laussane, Switserland and human glioblastoma U251
cell line was obtained from the Cell Culture Facility,
Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank, Shanghai. The
cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, USA) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA) under 37°C
and 5% CO2 condition and were plated onto culture dishes
(Nunc A/S, Roskilde, Denmark) at a density of 5×104/ml,
and incubated for 24h before further experiments. For H/E,
ICC staining and TUNEL assay (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA), dozens of cell-bearing coverslips were concurrently
prepared using the Nest-Dishes (Nest Biotech. Inc., Wuxi,
China; China invention patent No. ZL200610047607.8)
and collected regularly during drug treatments.

RNA isolation and RT-PCR
Total cellular RNAs of the experimental groups
were extracted using Trizol solution (Life Technology,
Grand Island, NY, USA). The sample RNAs were
subjected to reverse transcription/RT and then polymerase
chain reaction/PCR using the primers specific for CRABPII, RARα, RARβ, RARγ, RXRα, RXRβ, RXRγ, FABP5,
PPARδ, PPARγ, CYP26A1 and OLFM4 according to
producer’s protocols (Takara Inc., Dalian Branch, Dalian,
China). The sequences of PCR primers for each of the
gene transcripts were listed in Table 2. The PCR products
were resolved on ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose
gel and photographed under UV illumination (UVP, LLC,

with TBS-T and followed by 3h incubation at room
temperature with the first antibody, and 1h incubation with
HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Lab Inc., San
Francisco, CA, USA). The bound antibody was detected
using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Roche,
Penzberg, Germany). After removing the labeling signal
by incubation with stripping buffer (62.5 mM Tris–HCl,
pH 6.7, 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS) at 55°C for
30 min, the membrane was reprobed with other antibodies
one-by-one until all of the parameters were examined.

Immunocytochemical staining
CRABP II and FABP5 immunocytochemical (ICC)
staining were performed on the coverslips collected
from different experimental groups with the method
described elsewhere [40]. The antibodies used were rabbit
anti-human CRABP II and rabbit anti-human FABP5
(Proteintech, Chicago, IL, USA) at dilutions of 1:100 and
1:80, respectively. The sections without the first antibody
incubation were used as the background control.

Decitabine demethylation and RA treatment
Decitabine/DAC (5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; SigmaAldrich) is the most widely used inhibitor of DNA
methylation [42]. It was firstly diluted with culture
medium to 1μM to treat LN18, LN428 and U251 cells for
3 days by daily renewing decitabine-containing medium.
Then the DAC-treated cells were further treated by
10μM RA for another 2 days, The effects of DAC and
DAC combined RA on cell proliferation were determined
by MTT, flow cytometry and coverslip-based TUNEL
assay, morphological and ICC staining for CRABP-II and
FABP5. RNA and protein samples were prepared from all
groups for RT-PCR and Western blot analyses

Protein preparation and Western blotting
Total cellular proteins were prepared from the
cells under different culture conditions [41]. The sample
proteins (15μg/well) were separated by electrophoresis
in 10% sodium dodecylsulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (Amersham, Buckinghamshire,
UK). The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed
milk in TBS-T (10 mM Tris–Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl
and 0.5% Tween 20) at 4°C overnight, rinsed three times

DNA sequencing of FABP5 RT-PCR product

Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT).

Conflict of Interest

Since FABP5 could be detected in U251 cells at
RNA rather than protein level, DNA sequencing was
conducted on the RT-PCR product generated from
U251 cells to ascertain the specificity of PCR primers.
Briefly, the PCR products in the length of 281 bp were
amplified from 2.5 μl U251 RT products using the forward
(5’-AGCAGCTGGAAGGAAGATGG-3’) and reverse
(5’- CTGATGCTGAACCAATGCAC-3’) primers of
FABP5. The PCR products were prepared for sequencing
(3730xl sequenator, Life Tech, Texas, USA) according
to the protocol provided with the BigDye Terminator Kit
(Life Tech, Texas, USA). Sanger-sequenced clones of
full-length PCR products were analyzed with Sequencing
Analysis software (Version 5.2), then blasted with the
sequence of the corresponding region in Reference
mRNA of FABP5 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
gene/2171report=gene_table).

The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

FABP5 competitive inhibitor BMS309403 (Santa
Cruz) [28, 29] was dissolved in DMSO and diluted to
the final concentration of 25μM with culture medium.
Four experimental groups were set as follows: Group1,
normal culture; Group 2, treatment with 1.2‰ DMSO
as background control; Group 3, treatment with 10μM
RA; Group 4, 25μM BMS309403 treatment for 72 hours;
Groups 5, 25μM BMS309403 pretreatment for 6 hours
followed by 10μM RA for 72 hours. The influence of
BMS309403 in retinoic acid sensitivities of LN18, LN428
and U251 cells were determined by cell counting, viable/
unviable cell discrimination (Automated Cell Counter,
Bio-Rad, Singapore) and coverslip-based morphological
staining.
