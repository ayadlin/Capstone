ABSTRACT
TRAIL has been extensively explored as a cancer drug based on its tumor-selective
activity profile but it is incapable per se of discriminating between death receptors
expressed by normal host cells and transformed cancer cells. Furthermore, it is well
documented that surface tethering substantially increases its biologic activity. We have
previously reported on Meso-TR3, a constitutive TRAIL trimer targeted to the biomarker
MUC16 (CA125), in which the entire ectodomain of human mesothelin was genetically
fused to the TR3 platform, facilitating attachment to the cancer cells via the MUC16
receptor. Here, we designed a truncation variant, in which the minimal 64 amino acid
MUC16 binding domain of mesothelin was incorporated into TR3. It turned out that the
dual-domain biologic Meso64-TR3 retained its high MUC16 affinity and bound to the
cancer cells quickly, independent of the TR3/death receptor interaction. Furthermore,
it was substantially more potent than Meso-TR3 and TR3 in vitro and in a preclinical
xenograft model of MUC16-dependent ovarian cancer. Phenotypically, Meso64-TR3 is
more closely related to non-targeted TR3, evident by indistinguishable activity profiles
on MUC16-deficient cancers and similar thermal stability characteristics. Overall,
Meso64-TR3 represents a fully human, MUC16-targetd TRAIL-based biologic, ideally
suited for exploring preclinical and clinical evaluation studies in MUC16-dependent
malignancies.

death receptors DR4 and DR5 [10–14], which triggers cell
death through activation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway
[15], mediated via death receptor clustering and the formation
of the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) with the
involvement of the initiator caspase-8 and the executioner
caspase-3, ultimately leading to programmed cell death [16–
19]. Moreover, it turned out that TRAIL acted independently
of p53, which suggested that chemotherapy-resistant tumors
caused by inactivating mutations of this tumor suppressor
were still sensitive to TRAIL-based therapies [11, 20, 21].
Based on these features, a number of clinical trials have been
initiated, while numerous attempts to develop more potent
TRAIL variants were concurrently explored, including

INTRODUCTION
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL) was discovered in the mid 1990’s as a
new member of the large tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
superfamily and caught immediate attention as a promising
cancer therapeutic [1–4]. Viewed as the most favorable
property of TRAIL as a drug candidate was the fact that it
selectively induced apoptosis in transformed tumor cells but
not in normal cells in vivo, without causing toxicity following
systemic applications [5–7], one of the key discoveries
among members of the TNF superfamily [8, 9]. TRAIL exerts
its biological functions via binding to cell surface-expressed

stabilization with trimerization domains (leucine zipper
[LZ]), formation of higher-order TRAIL complexes and
genetic fusions with the constant regions (Fc) of human
immunoglobulins [22–24].
In this regard, we have pioneered an entirely new
concept to generate constitutively trimerized TRAIL
biologics via genetic engineering. This novel drug design
was created by covalently linking three TRAIL ectodomains
into a single fusion protein, designated TR3, characterized
by enhanced stability and apoptosis induction capacity and
the ability for downstream modification options in a modular
and stoichiometrically fully-controlled fashion [25]. The
latter aspect has far reaching consequences with respect to
developing truly tumor-targeted TR3 biologics, selective
for a given cell surface biomarker. This targeting concept is
particularly attractive not only for the site-specific delivery
and the accumulation of the therapeutics at the tumor cell
membrane, it converts soluble TR3 drugs into membranebound analogs, a process which substantially increases death
receptor signaling and thereby the overall bioactivity of the
therapeutic [26]. More specifically, by taking advantage of
the high affinity interaction between mesothelin and MUC16
[27], we recently designed a mesothelin/TR3 fusion protein,
designated Meso-TR3, in order to tether our therapeutic to the
MUC16 biomarker located on the tumor cell membrane [28].
Even though Meso-TR3 demonstrated several
favorable properties, such as improved bioactivity on
MUC16-expressing tumors in vitro and in vivo, we
suspected that it’s relatively large molecular weight could
prove prohibitive when it comes to drug penetration into
solid tumors, as these are often characterized by extensive
stromal components, especially relevant in pancreatic
cancer [29, 30]. Based on this consideration and the notion
that the amino-terminal 64 amino acids of mesothelin have
been described to be sufficient to facilitate binding to native
MUC16 [Ref. [31]], we designed a Meso-TR3 truncation
variant, designated Meso64-TR3. Here, we describe the
properties of this re-designed, MUC16-targeted TR3
trimer in a head-to-head comparison with its full length
first-generation predecessor and demonstrate its unaltered
MUC16 binding capacity combined with improved stability
and superior biologic activity. We identified the high affinity
of the mesothelin/MUC16 interaction as the dominant
parameter for the rapid attachment of targeted TR3 fusion
proteins to MUC16-positive cancer cells with the TR3/DR
interaction playing a secondary role. We thus believe that
Meso64-TR3 will be widely applicable for the treatment
of MUC16-positive malignancies, including ovarian, breast
and pancreatic cancers [32–34].

entire mature ectodomain of human mesothelin fused to
the N-terminus of TR3 [28]. However, Meso-TR3 is a
rather bulky molecule and contains several mesothelinderived glycosylation sites, which heavily contribute to its
large molecular weight. Along these lines, and in an effort
to reduce the molecular weight of MUC16-targeted MesoTR3, it has been shown that the 64 N-terminal amino acids
of mesothelin are sufficient to facilitate strong interaction
with MUC16 [35]. These considerations prompted us to
design a truncation variant by inserting the corresponding
64 amino acid mesothelin-encoding cDNA into the
5’-terminus of the TR3 expression platform (Figure
1A). Both MUC16-targeted recombinant fusion proteins
contain an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag for immunologic
detection purposes (not shown). The proteins were
produced in HEK293T cells and their molecular weight
was confirmed by Western blot analysis. With ≈65 kDa,
Meso64-TR3 was only ≈5 kDa larger (+8%) than parental
TR3 (≈61 kDa) and ≈35 kDa smaller (-35%) than MesoTR3 (≈100 kDa) (Figure 1B).
Due to the drastically reduced targeting domain, an
initial concern was the ability of Meso64-TR3 to interact
efficiently with native MUC16. We therefore performed
confocal microscopy following drug exposure employing
the MUC16-positive ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR3.
Since Meso64-TR3 represents a dual-domain therapeutic
(a MUC16 interacting-, and a death receptor effector
domain), two possible binding mechanisms had to be
distinguished: the TR3/death receptor interaction (DR4,
DR5, DcR1 and DcR2) and the mesothelin/MUC16
interaction. In order to prevent drug binding via the
TR3/DR interaction, Meso64-TR3 was complexed with
soluble death receptor 5 (DR5-Fc), prior to exposure to
the cancer cells [28]. Confocal microscopy confirmed a
signal overlap between the MUC16 marker and surfacetethered Meso64-TR3 (Figure 1C). These initial results
were highly encouraging and suggested that the minimal
MUC16 binding domain of human mesothelin (amino
acids 1 - 64) was indeed sufficient to tether Meso64-TR3
to the OVCAR3 cell membrane. Similar binding results
were obtained in other cancer cell types, such as HeLa
(cervical cancer) and HPAC (pancreatic cancer), both
characterized by more heterogenous MUC16 expression
profiles (see below).

RESULTS

Our TRAIL-based biologics are characterized by
a multi-domain architecture, a biomarker recognition
domain (mesothelin) and the activation domain of the
extrinsic death pathway (TR3). In an attempt to shed light
on the isolated functionality of the TR3 effector domain,
we treated TRAIL-sensitive, MUC16-deficient Jurkat cells
with our biologics. All of our drugs induced target cell

death in a dose-dependent fashion. Of note, at equimolar
concentrations, Meso64-TR3’s activity profile exactly
matched that of non-targeted TR3, whereas Meso-TR3’s
potency was substantially reduced, consistent with our
previous report (Figure 2A). Similar activity profiles were
obtained for all three drugs on other cell types known to be
largely devoid of MUC16-expression, again highlighting
the similarity between Meso64-TR3 and non-targeted
TR3 relative to Meso-TR3 (Figure 2B, BxPC3 pancreatic
cancer).
Most importantly, however, when all three drugs
were tested on MUC16-positive ovarian cancer cells,
Meso64-TR3 was capable of eradicating nearly all target
cells (92%), followed by Meso-TR3 (59%) and TR3 (14%)
(Figure 2C). Moreover, when TR3 and Meso64-TR3 were
tested in a preclinical model of MUC16-positive ovarian
cancer, the targeted drug variant outperformed its nontargeted analog with regard to a delay in tumor growth

(Figure 2D), which corresponded with a significant life
extension of the animals, with median survivals of 23.5
days (control), 26.5 days (TR3) and 32.5 days (Meso64TR3), respectively (Figure 2E). These results were very
encouraging and suggest that the N-terminal 64 amino
acids of mesothelin are not only sufficient to facilitate
efficient binding to native MUC16, it converts Meso64TR3 into a much more powerful cancer drug that retains
its enhanced in vitro activity profile in a preclinical mouse
model of ovarian cancer.

Meso64-TR3-mediated cancer cell death is
consistent with apoptosis
Whenever modifications are introduced into an
established drug candidate, such as TR3, it is crucial to
perform a series of validation experiments to ensure
that key characteristics are retained in the drug variant.

These considerations also apply to the MUC16-targeted
truncation variant Meso64-TR3. In order to verify
that the enhanced activity profile of Meso64-TR3 was
indeed related to its membrane tethering to MUC16,
soluble mesothelin was used to block this interaction.
In the presence of increasing concentrations of soluble
mesothelin, we noticed a dose-dependent reduction in
its ability to induce cell death from nearly 80% to below
53% (Figure 3A). It was further anticipated that, once
attached to the cancer cell membrane, apoptosis was
mediated by engagement of the TR3-effector domain with
membrane-expressed death receptors, especially DR4
and/or DR5. We thus performed blocking experiments
employing soluble death receptor 5 (DR5-Fc). When
OVCAR3 cells were treated with Meso64-TR3 in the
presence of increasing concentrations of DR5-Fc, a dosedependent reduction of cell death was accomplished from
92% (no inhibitor) to 11% at the highest concentration of
the inhibitor (Figure 3B). Similar results were seen with
MUC16-deficient Jurkat cells (data not shown). These data
support the notion that Meso64-TR3 does indeed require

engagement with activating death receptors at the plasma
cell membrane to induce cancer cell death.
The previous experiments provided circumstantial
evidence for the activation of the extrinsic death pathway
being responsible for the improved properties of Meso64TR3 on MUC16-positive cancer cells. To further solidify
these presumptions, we performed additional biochemical
analyses regarding the key players involved in the
activation and execution of apoptosis, caspases-8,-9, and
-3. First, we treated OVCAR3 cells with TR3 and Meso64TR3 for 24 h, prepared cell lysates and assessed the
activation status of the most proximal signaling molecule
relative to the death receptors, caspase-8, by Western
blot analysis. Consistent with the strong activity profile
of Meso64-TR3 on these cells, we did notice a robust
induction of activated cleavage fragments of caspase-8,
along with a reduction in the signal intensity of its
precursor. This activation pattern was absent for both the
TR3 and non-treated control cells (Figure 3C). To verify
these initial results, we determined the activation profiles
of caspases-8, -3 and -9 using a different assay system

(Caspase-Glo assay, see M&M for details). This more
quantitative analysis tool also enabled us to determine
the kinetics of caspase activation. It turned out that all
three caspases were activated with the same kinetics,
with an activation peak around four hours post-treatment
(Figure 3D). The importance of caspase activation as a

mediator of Meso64-TR3-dependent cancer cell death was
finally confirmed using the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VADFMK. This irreversible inhibitor of intracellular caspase
activation completely protected OVCAR3 cells from
apoptosis (Figure 3E). Taken together, the strong deathinducing properties of Meso64-TR3 were found to depend

(the targeting and the effector domain). Initially, we
exposed TR3, Meso-TR3 and Meso64-TR3 to elevated,
non-physiologic temperature conditions (60 min at 56
ºC) and studied the effects on the TR3 effector domain
of the fusion proteins using MUC16-negative Jurkat cells.
Under these conditions, Meso-TR3 lost more than 70% of
its initial killing capacity, while Meso64-TR3 and TR3 lost
less than 25% of their initial activities (Figure 4A, Jurkat).
The same trend was noticed when the drugs were assessed
on MUC16-expressing OVCAR3 cells. While Meso-TR3
lost nearly 64% of its baseline killing capacity, Meso64TR3 lost only 19% (Figure 4B, OVCAR3). Both of these
results further underscore the high phenotypic similarities

Meso64-TR3 is a temperature-stabilized
monomer
In order to complete the characterization phase
of Meso64-TR3, we exposed our novel cancer drug to
physiologic and elevated temperature conditions and
assessed the impact of these parameters on the respective
structural components of the dual-domain therapeutics

between TR3 and Meso64-TR3, which are in contrast
to the more temperature-sensitive and less active fusion
protein Meso-TR3. Under less stringent temperature
conditions (physiologic 37 ºC) but extended storage time
(1 - 7 days), the same trend was noted. After an entire
week of incubation at 37 ºC, Meso64-TR3 retained nearly
all of its killing capacity on OVCAR3 cells (90%), while
Meso-TR3 lost its activity quickly to only 40% of its
initial potency (Figure 4C).
In our previous study, we reported on the
monomeric nature of Meso-TR3, which was based on
experimental evidence that following crosslinking with
a mesothelin-specific monoclonal antibody, a drastic
increase in bioactivity was achieved on MUC16-negative
Jurkat cells [28]. Since truncated Meso64-TR3 did likely
no longer contain the binding epitope for this mAb, we
used an antibody directed against the FLAG epitope tag of
our fusion proteins. When BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells
were treated with a sublethal dose of Meso64-TR3 (~25%
cell death) in the presence of the anti-FLAG monoclonal
antibody M2, we could demonstrate a dose-dependent
augmentation of cell death to nearly 80% at the highest
concentration of cross-linking antibody (Figure 4D).
These results strongly suggest that Meso64-TR3 is indeed
a monomer in solution that can be functionally enhanced
by forming homodimers via antibody crosslinking.

the high affinity of the mesothelin/MUC16 interaction
likely dominates the TR3/DR interaction of the fusion
protein and leads to a quick absorption of Meso64-TR3
by MUC16-expressing cells (see below for a more detailed
analysis using an extrinsic pathway sensitizer to reveal this
phenomenon).
We next used more quantitative means (flow
cytometry) to document the selective killing capacity
of Meso64-TR3 on MUC16-positive cancer cells. For
this experiment, we treated HeLa cells, a native mix
of MUC16-positive and -negative cells, with TR3 and
Meso64-TR3. Several days later, the cells were analyzed
for their MUC16 expression profiles. While TR3 alone was
unable to alter the MUC16 ratio, similar to the untreated
control cells, treatment with Meso64-TR3 decreased the
number of MUC16-positive cells by nearly 70% (Figure
5B, 5C). These findings support our binding data in that
the MUC16-positive cells are selectively targeted and
eliminated by Meso64-TR3, a feature not shared with nontargeted TR3.

Meso64-TR3 retains MUC16-selective killing
properties in cancers refractory to TRAIL
monotherapy
It is well known that not all cancers are equally
responsive to TRAIL treatment. In fact, some cancers are
quite resistant with regard to apoptosis induced via the
extrinsic death pathway. Fortunately, an ever increasing
number of sensitizing agents of the TRAIL death receptor
pathway are available and have been studied extensively,
including targeted SMAC mimetics [36–39]. In order to
assess the potential benefit of a MUC16-targeted TR3
variant over its non-targeted counterpart on MUC16positive cells that are refractory to TRAIL treatment, we
took advantage of our recently designed, cancer-targeted
small molecule SMAC mimetic SW IV-134 [40, 41]. It
was predicted to be ideally suited to augment the extrinsic
death pathway due to its dual activity profile involving
cIAP degradation and XIAP blockade. In our current
study, we explored the pathway sensitizer SW IV-134 in
an effort to document the differential killing characteristics
between MUC16-targeted and non-targeted forms of TR3.
To determine the optimal drug doses for the
assessment of additive/synergistic treatment effects,
OVCAR3 cells (TRAIL-sensitive, 100% MUC16+) were
treated with increasing concentrations of TR3, Meso64TR3 and SW IV-134. At picomolar concentrations, TR3
and Meso64-TR3 displayed their characteristic activity
profiles with Meso64-TR3 being substantially more
potent than TR3 (Figures 6A and 6B). SW IV-134 induced
cell death in a dose-depending fashion consistent with
previously published data and required a low micromolar
concentration range [40]. When both drugs were combined
additively, the cells responded to the drugs much stronger.
At the lowest concentration of each agent (43.5 pM

Targeted Meso64-TR3 selectively eliminates
MUC16-positive cancer cells
It was predicted that the enhanced killing capacity
of Meso64-TR3 was mediated by a selective delivery
mechanism to MUC16-positive cells, followed by
induction of apoptosis through TR3/DR interaction [28].
If this was true, we anticipated that MUC16-positive
cancer cells should be preferentially eliminated from a
heterogeneous mix of positive and negative cells. The
human cervical cancer cell line HeLa is an example of
a native mix of MUC16-positive and negative cells.
Confocal microscopy was employed to identify the various
expression levels on different cells within the mix. After
treating the cells with Meso64-TR3/DR5-Fc complexes
(necessary to prevent binding directly via TR3, compare
Figure 1C), we identified MUC16-negative cells that also
lacked the signal for our cancer drug (Figure 5A, DR5Fc[+], arrows).
In order to study a potential hierarchy of binding
events and/or affinities of our dual-domain therapeutic
(mesothelin/MUC16 vs. TR3/DR), we treated HeLa cells
only briefly (10 min) with Meso64-TR3 in the absence
of TR3-blockade (no DR5-Fc complex formation). Even
under these conditions, we obtained similar staining
profiles as in the presence of TR3-blockade, with areas
lacking signals for both MUC16 and Meso64-TR3 (Figure
5A, DR5-Fc[-], dashed line). These data gave us first clues
regarding the hierarchy of binding events and suggest that

TRAIL drugs and 2 µM SW IV-134), TR3’s killing
capacity increased only to ~20%, while Meso64-TR3
killed more than 90% of the cells (Figures 6A and 6B). In
order to achieve nearly complete tumor cell elimination
following combination therapy with TR3, a 3-fold higher
molar concentration of TR3 and a 4-fold higher SW IV134 concentration were required (Figure 6A and 6B; 130.6
pM TR3 + 8 µM SW IV-134 versus 43.5 pM Meso64TR3 + 2 µM SW IV-134, black arrows). Combination
therapy substantially reduced the amounts of drugs
needed to achieve complete tumor cell death with 5-fold
less Meso64-TR3 and 8-fold-less SW IV-134 (Figure 6B,
compare black and open arrow). The strong sensitizing
effect of SW IV-134 during Meso64-TR3 co-treatment
was suggestive of a synergistic cell death mechanism.
We thus repeated this experiment by lowering both drug
doses during combination treatment (Supplementary

Figure S1A). Mathematical modeling using CompuSyn
software [42] confirmed a synergistic rather than an
additive drug effect with a combination index (CI) < 1
(range: 0.16 - 0.63) (Supplementary Figure S1B).
We next repeated the above experiment with the
TRAIL-refractory cell lines HPAC (pancreatic cancer)
and HeLa (cervical cancer), both comprised of a 50% 80% mixture of MUC16-expressing cells. Even though
both cell lines express varying levels of MUC16,
treatment with targeted and non-targeted TR3 variants
was rather inefficient and did not cause significant cell
death within the indicated concentration range (Figures
6C and 6E). However, following pathway sensitization
with SW IV-134 (4 µM constant dose), MUC16-targeted
Meso64-TR3 outperformed its non-targeted counterpart
in both instances (Figures 6D and 6F). Of note, and
only following combination treatment, Meso64-TR3

a mixed population of HPAC pancreatic cancer cells
(Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). These data are
in agreement with a selective accumulation of targeted
Meso64-TR3 on biomarker-expressing cancer cells, a
process that is independent of the TR3/DR interaction
(Supplementary Figure S2C). Along these lines,
combination treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with
absent (or nearly undetectable) MUC16 expression did
not result in a differential killing profile between the two
TRAIL drugs (Supplementary Figure S3).

Functional cell viability data suggested that MesoTR3 and Meso64-TR3 appeared to have much higher
affinity to MUC16-expressing cancer cells than nontargeted TR3. However, the corresponding assays were
usually performed following a 24 h drug exposure. In
order to unequivocally proof this hypothesis, we designed
an experiment in which OVCAR3 cells (100% MUC16-

and refractory cancer cells. Cell viability determinations were performed on TRAIL sensitive OVCAR3 cells (A. and B. 100%

MUC16) and the TRAIL refractory cells HPAC (C. and D. 50% MUC16) and HeLa (E. and F. 60%- 80% MUC16). In order to
illustrate the benefit of MUC16 targeting, OVCAR3 cells were treated with TR3 (A), Meso64-TR3 (B) and SW IV-134 (A, B) alone and in
combination with each other at increasing concentrations of both cancer drugs. Please note that the drug concentrations required to achieve
close to 100% target cell death using combination therapy (solid arrows) are much reduced for Meso64-TR3 compared to the drugs used in
isolation (open arrow). The killing capacities of TR3 and Meso64-TR3 were also studied on cells that were refractory to TRAIL treatment
in the absence (C; HPAC, NS, not significant and E; HeLa, NS, not significant) and in the presence of pathway sensitization using constant
doses of SW IV-134 (D; HPAC, **P < 0.004 and F; HeLa, **P < 0.003).

positive) were exposed for short time periods (5 - 60 min)
to equimolar concentrations of the TR3 drugs (targeted
or non-targeted), washed extensively to remove the nonbound biologics, followed by a 24 h exposure to the
pathway sensitizer SW IV-134. This two-step design
allowed us to separate initial drug binding events from
pathway amplification, primarily as an experimental tool,
necessary due to the limited activity profile of TR3 on
OVCAR3 cells.
And indeed, we noticed a time-dependent increase
in overall cell killing capacity for all TR3 drugs in
combination with SW IV-134 (baseline activity: 31%).
The most dramatic effect was seen with Meso64-TR3,
approaching 95% cell death induction after only a five
minute binding interval (Figure 7). Prolongation of the
binding time did not increase cell death induction and
suggests that Meso64-TR3 saturated the cancer cell
membrane quickly within the first five minutes of drug
exposure. Meso-TR3 required a 60 minute binding time to
achieve maximum target cell killing (94%), followed by
TR3 (can only bind via DR interaction) with a 70% killing

maximum at the one hour drug exposure mark. Overall,
the time-response killing curves obtained following
pathway sensitization with SW IV-134 closely mimic
the dose-response activity profiles for the respective
TR3 drugs when used alone (compare Figure 2C) and
highlight the benefits of tethering TR3-based therapeutics
to the cancer cells via the high-affinity interaction between
mesothelin and MUC16.

DISCUSSION
Cancer therapy usually offers only a narrow
window of opportunity when it comes to finding the most
appropriate drug doses while limiting toxic side effects
for the patients. In this regard, TRAIL has garnered
tremendous interest as a cancer drug as it has demonstrated
tumor-selective activity profiles without being toxic to the
host. Along these lines, it is important to point out that
the native cytokine, as well as our recently designed drug
platform TR3, does not have the capacity per se to actively
discriminate between transformed cancer cells and healthy

Figure 7: Meso64-TR3’s enhanced activity profile is dominated by its much enhanced binding affinity and rapid
surface tethering to MUC16-positive cancer cells. OVCAR3 cells were exposed for the indicated time points to TR3, Meso-TR3

and Meso64-TR3 (218 pM each). Then, the cells were washed three times with PBS in order to remove the unbound biologics, followed
by treatment of all cells with a constant dose SW IV-134 for additional 24 hours (8 μM), after which cell viability was determined. Please
note that in order to achieve close to complete target cell death, Meso64-TR3 required only a five minute binding interval, not matched by
TR3 and not even Meso-TR3. P < 0.003.

host tissues. These non-transformed host tissues, including
certain immune effector cells, have been shown to express
various TRAIL receptors and act primarily as a “sink”
for TRAIL-based therapeutics [43–45], but are protected
from the cytokine by intracellular cFLIP expression [43].
Furthermore, other non-immune host cells, under certain
inflammatory conditions, can even become susceptible
to TRAIL therapy, a potential cause of undesirable side
effects [46–48].
Over the years, various recombinant TRAIL
variants have been engineered to enhance the stability
and pharmacologic potency of the cytokine but, much
to our surprise, truly cancer-targeted variants have not
yet been tested in clinical trials. In order to endow the
TRAIL cytokine with tumor selectivity and to minimize
potential off-target toxicities, targeting moieties need to
be incorporated into the therapeutics. Such downstream
modifications would not only ensure accumulation of
the therapeutics at the tumor site, it tethers the drugs
via biomarker association to the tumor cell surface.
This membrane conversion has been shown to result
in far more robust death receptor signaling events than
the non-targeted parental variants can ever accomplish
[28, 49, 50].
In this study, we built on our previously established
drug platform TR3 [25] and generated a truncation variant
of Meso-TR3 [28], designated Meso64-TR3, representing
a functionally improved, next generation TRAIL-based
cancer therapeutic targeted to the biomarker MUC16.
Meso-TR3 is a rather bulky molecule with a
molecular weight of more than 100 kDa, primarily due to
its extended secondary structure (amino acid sequence),
relative to the more compact structural organization of
Meso64-TR3. By eliminating more than 75% of the
C-terminal region of the mesothelin targeting moiety,
three putative glycosylation sites were removed, which
contributed significantly to the molecular weight loss
relative to Meso-TR3. Also, it has been known for a while
[27] and recently confirmed [35] that the amino-terminal
64 amino acids of mesothelin were sufficient to facilitate
efficient binding to MUC16. Our current study was thus
primarily designed as a proof-of-concept to assess if such
a short peptide sequence would still facilitate binding
to native MUC16, especially in the context of a fusion
protein with a TR3 effector domain being nearly 6.5-fold
the size of the 64 amino acid mesothelin binding moiety.
We were therefore encouraged to see that Meso64-TR3’s
binding affinity to the MUC16 biomarker was not only
retained but resulted in a much more potent cancer drug
compared to its full length predecessor on MUC16positive tumor cells. On the other hand, it turned out that
Meso64-TR3 and TR3 were functionally indistinguishable
on MUC16-negative cancer cells (Jurkat and other, nearly
MUC16-negative cancer cells, such as BxPC3), while
Meso-TR3 showed a markedly reduced activity profile
on these cells, in accordance with its previously proposed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

prodrug feature [28]. We can only speculate about the
reason(s) for Meso64-TR3 being much more potent
than Meso-TR3 on MUC16-expressing cancer cells but
we believe that the high sensitivity of the full length
mesothelin targeting moiety to elevated (56 ˚C) and even
to physiologically more relevant temperature conditions
(37 ˚C) might be a key discriminating factor for MesoTR3’s reduced functional properties.
While in the process of characterizing this novel
cancer drug candidate on a mechanistic level, we
confirmed that key extrinsic pathway components were
engaged following Meso64-TR3 treatment. In addition,
biophysical analyses demonstrated much enhanced
thermal stability of Meso64-TR3 over Meso-TR3 on
MUC16-positive and -negative cancer cells, acting as a
monomer in solution with a preference to eliminate the
cells it binds. Along these lines, the substantially enhanced
activity profile of Meso64-TR3 compared to TR3 on
OVCAR3 cells is quite remarkable, given that these cells
have been reported to be nearly resistant to TRAIL due to
MUC16-dependent upregulation of cFLIP and a reduction
in DR5 expression [51]. Thus, despite these unfavorable
circumstances, we could demonstrate that membrane
tethering to MUC16 with Meso64-TR3 (and Meso-TR3
to a lesser extend) could indeed overcome the therapeutic
plateau observed with non-targeted TRAIL variants.
Furthermore, we shed new light on potential
hierarchies with respect to epitope preferences, primarily
responsible for initial drug binding events at the cancer
cell membrane. Since MUC16-targeted TR3 represents a
dual-domain therapeutic, at least two binding scenarios
can be discriminated – 1. the mesothelin/biomarker
(MUC16) interaction and 2. the TR3/death receptor
interaction. In our previous study, we addressed this
ambiguity by preincubating the targeted reagent (MesoTR3) with soluble death receptor (DR5-Fc), to ensure that
the binding process to MUC16 was exclusively mediated
by the mesothelin targeting moiety of the fusion protein
[28]. In our current study, we assessed this aspect in
greater detail and included experiments in which complex
formation with DR5-Fc was omitted. Confocal imaging
data suggested that the strong affinity of mesothelin
to MUC16, including our latest data on the 64 aminoacid truncation variant Meso64-TR3, dominated during
the attachment process over the native death receptor
interaction, since the staining patterns in the presence
and absence of death receptor blockade turned out to be
indistinguishable.
In an attempt to further confirm our imaging results
and to demonstrate the advantage of using targeted
versus non-targeted TR3 therapeutics for cancer therapy,
we designed experiments in which the extrinsic death
pathway was sensitized with an activator of the intrinsic
pathway using the small molecule drug conjugate SW IV134 [40, 41]. We could indeed show that extrinsic pathway
sensitization with SW IV-134 had a much stronger effect

for targeted TR3 therapy than non-targeted TR3 by
shifting the therapeutic index further to lower overall
drug concentrations in combination with Meso64-TR3
on various cancer cell lines exhibiting varying MUC16
expression levels. When this pathway sensitizer was
incorporated in a time-dependent, “functional binding”
assay, we could demonstrate that Meso64-TR3 required
the shortest exposure time to achieve the highest target
cell deaths, followed by Meso-TR3 and the non-targeted
TR3 parent. These results highlight the positive impact
of a high biomarker affinity for the development of
targeted TR3-based drugs in order to ensure efficient drug
accumulation on the cancer targets, thereby preventing
systemic toxicities during future preclinical and clinical
investigations. Along these lines, we are currently in the
process of confirming the enhanced uptake properties of
MUC16-targeted Meso64-TR3 by the tumors in vivo, in
relation to its non-targeted TR3 counterpart.
And finally, another important aspect regarding the
mesothelin/MUC16 interaction is its potential contribution
to homotypic (tumor cell-tumor cell) and heterotypic (tumor
cell-mesothelial cell) cell interactions, especially important
for the peritoneal spread in ovarian cancer patients [52]. The
latter type of interaction is believed to promote adherence
of tumor cells to the peritoneum, resulting in metastatic
spread of the primary lesion into the abdomen [27, 53, 54].
These considerations suggest that by binding to MUC16,
Meso64-TR3 may also saturate and reduce or even eliminate
the available binding sites on the biomarker for adhesive
interactions with mesothelin-expressing normal endothelium,
thereby limiting the dissemination of tumor cells in addition
to augmenting TRAIL-mediated target cell death [55].
Taken together, we predict that the strong affinity
of Meso64-TR3 to native MUC16, combined with its
favorable thermal stability and monomeric character are
key ingredients for a successful clinical application. We
further anticipate that the high affinity of Meso64-TR3
to the MUC16 biomarker facilitates rapid absorption and
accumulation of the systemic drug by the tumors and
results in a fast clearance from the bloodstream. Once
tethered to the cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, pathway
sensitization is further expected to enhance treatment
efficacy while systemic off-target toxicities are predicted to
be kept at a minimum. Thus, systematic pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies of our targeted cancer
therapeutics (biologics and small molecule conjugates) are
clearly warranted to further demonstrate a treatment benefit
of targeted combination therapy in preclinical animal
studies in preparation for future clinical trials.

obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA). Recombinant human TRAIL was
purchased from Enzo Life Science (formerly BIOMOL,
International, Farmingdale, NY). The sigma-2/SMAC
drug conjugate SW IV-134 was synthesized as previously
reported [40]. Cell viability was detected using luciferasebased readout (CellTiter-Glo, Promega, Madison, WI).
Caspase activation was determined employing CaspaseGlo Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). The pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK was purchased from Enzo
Life Sciences (Ann Arbor, MI).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities were detected in
OVCAR3 cells treated with Meso64-TR3 employing
a Caspase-Glo Assay System according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Promega, Madison, WI).
OVCAR3 cells were seeded at a density of 1x104 in 96
well plates and then treated for 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours with

Plasmid construction and protein production
The basic TR3 expression plasmid [25], soluble
mesothelin and Meso-TR3 were generated as previously
described [28]. Meso64-TR3 was generated via insertion
of a 261 bp BsiWI/Asp718 (compatible with BsiWI) PCR
fragment into the unique BsiWI restriction site of the TR3
expression platform, verified by DNA sequencing. All
recombinant TR3 forms, soluble mesothelin, and DR5Fc were produced in HEK293T cells under serum-free
conditions as described [25, 28]. To obtain concentrated
protein stocks, the supernatants were applied to centrifugal
filter devices with a 10 kDa molecular cut-off (Centricon
Plus-20, Millipore, Billerica, MA). DR5-Fc was purified
using Protein A columns as per the manufacturer’s
instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

Analysis of cell death
Cells were seeded into 96 well plates at the
respective optimal densities (1x104 for OVCAR3 and
HeLa cells, 5x104 for Jurkat cells, 2x104 for BxPC3 and
AsPC-1 cells, and 1.5x104for HPAC cells). Treatment
was initiated the following day and cell viability was
determined 18 hours after treatment using CellTiterGlo Luminescent Viability Assay according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Promega Madison, WI).
The treatment conditions involved the various TRAIL
variants alone (TR3, Meso-TR3 and Meso64-TR3) and
combinations with SW IV-134 (drug binding/combination
experiments); DR5-Fc, mesothelin and Z-VAD-FMK
(blocking experiments) and anti-FLAG mAb (dimer
formation experiment). Data were recorded using a MultiDetection Microplate Reader (Synergy HT, BioTek,
Winooski, VT).

with 4% paraformaldehyde, the cells were blocked with
serum-free Protein Block (Dako, Carpinteria, CA).
Primary antibodies for FLAG (mouse mAb M2) and
MUC16 (rabbit pAb, Sigma-Aldrich) were allowed to bind
for 2 h, washed and detected with the respective secondary
Abs Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG
(Invitrogen). Confocal images were taken on a Zeiss LSM
510 META Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Zeiss,
Jena, Germany).

Western blot analysis
OVCAR3 cells were seeded in 10 cm plates and
treated for 4 hours with vehicle, TR3 or Meso64-TR3
the following day. After washing twice with PBS, the
cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with
complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm
for 15 minutes and the supernatants were collected. The
samples (30 µL for each treatment condition) were run
on a 4-12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gradient gel and
transferred to a PVDF membrane using an iBlot 2 Gel
Transfer Device (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).
The PVDF membrane was incubated at 4 ˚C for 24
hours with a mouse anti-caspase-8 mAb (Cell Signalling
Technology, Danvers, MA), followed by a 1 hours
incubation at room temperature with HRP-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotech, Dallas, TX). Immunoreactive bands were
visualized using ClarityTM Western ECL Substrate (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).

Time-dependent cell death analysis
To compare the binding capacity of non-targeted
and MUC16 targeted TRAIL constructs, a binding assay
was performed by allowing different binding time for
these three drugs. OVCAR3 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates (1x104/well) and cultured for 18 hours. Equimolar
concentrations of TR3, Meso-TR3 and Meso64-TR3 (218
pM) were added to the wells for 5, 10, 30 and 60 minutes
before the supernatants were removed and the cells were
washed three times with PBS to remove traces of unbound
drugs from the wells. Due to the limited activity of TR3
on OVCAR3 cells, the pathway sensitizer SW IV-134 (8
µM) was subsequently added to all wells. Cell death was
analyzed using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Viability Assay
as described above.

Animals
Six to eight week old female Severe Combined
Immunodeficiency mice (SCID; Harlan, IN) were used as
hosts for tumor xenografts. Human OVCAR3 tumor pieces
(2 x 2 mm2) were implanted into the flanks and allowed to
engraft until reaching a volume of 100 mm3 prior to grouping
and drug treatment (655 pmoles/mouse/day for 13 days).
Procedures involving mice were approved by the Washington
University Animal Studies Committee and conducted in
accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of
laboratory research animals established by the NIH.

Flow cytometry
To assess the selective killing capacity of Meso64TR3 on MUC16-positive tumor cells, HeLa and HPAC
cells (1.5x105/well and 3x105/well, respectively) were
seeded into 6-well plates for 24 hours before treatment
with TR3, Meso64-TR3 or medium (control) in the
absence or presence of 4 µM SW IV-134 (to amplify the
TRAIL-induced extrinsic death pathway). After incubation
at 37 ˚C for 24 hours, the supernatants were replaced
by fresh medium and the cells were allowed to grow to
sub-confluence. Cells were washed and harvested nonenzymatically (EDTA). The cells were then incubated
with anti-MUC16 mAb X75 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA),
followed by staining with FITC-conjugated secondary
antibody (anti-mouse IgG, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) and submitted to flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Statistical analyses
Treatment efficiency of in vitro killing assays and in
vivo tumor growth rates are presented as means ± SEM.
Statistical significance for all analyses is defined as P <
0.05 and was calculated employing analysis of variance
(one-way ANOVA, Tukey’s Multiple Comparison Test)
and the Student’s t-test (unpaired) as indicated using
GraphPad Prism (V 4.02) software.
