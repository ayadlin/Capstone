Abstract
LMP1, which is encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus, is proposed to be one of
the major oncogenic factors involved in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Previous
studies demonstrated that down-regulation of LMP1 by LMP1-targeted DNAzyme
(DZ1) increases the radiosensitivity of NPC. However, the mechanism by which DZ1
contributes to this radiosensitivity remains unclear. In this study, we determined
whether a DZ1 blockade of LMP1 expression has an overall positive effect on the
radiotherapy of NPCs by repressing HIF-1/VEGF activity and to investigate the
mechanisms underlying LMP1-induced HIF-1 activation in NPC cells. The results
showed that DZ1 inhibited the microtubule-forming ability of HUVECs co-cultured
with NPC cells, which occurs with the down-regulation of VEGF expression and
secretion. Moreover, LMP1 increases phosphorylated JNKs/c-Jun signaling, which
is involved in the regulation of HIF-1/VEGF activity. After silencing LMP1 and
decreasing phosphorylation of JNKs, NPC cells exhibited an enhanced radiosensitivity.
Furthermore, in vivo experiments revealed a significant inhibition of tumor growth
and a marked reduction of the Ktrans parameter, which reflects the condition of tumor
micro-vascular permeability. Taken together, our data suggested that VEGF expression
is increased by LMP1 through the JNKs/c-Jun signaling pathway and indicated that
DZ1 enhances the radiosensitivity of NPC cells by inhibiting HIF-1/VEGF activity.

Introduction

a high proportion of patients who undergo radiotherapy
[1]. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is an EBVencoded protein with oncogenic properties [2]. LMP1
plays an essential role in tumorigenesis of NPCs
through the activity of various signal pathways and is
thus a potential target for NPC biotherapy [3-5]. Downregulation of LMP1 was shown to be potentially effective

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy
most strongly associated with the Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV), and radiotherapy is the most effective treatment
against NPC. However, due to radioresistance, locoregional recurrence or metastatic spread still occurs in

in the prevention of NPC metastasis and reduction of NPC
radioresistance [6, 7]. However, the mechanism of LMP1mediated radioresistance is not entirely clear.
Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) regulates the
response to radiotherapy treatment [8]. When HIF-1β
is constitutively expressed, HIF-1α activity is increased
not only by intratumoral hypoxia but also by genetic
alterations under normoxic conditions [9]. One of the
major targeted and activated genes is vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), which plays a key role in tumor
progression and angiogenesis. Moreover, VEGF has been
reported to not only induce angiogenesis but also protects
endothelial cells from the cytotoxic effects of irradiation
and consequently increased tumor radioresistance [10].
Thus, HIF-1 plays a major role in the development of the
tumor phenotype and affects tumor growth, angiogenesis,
invasiveness, and metastasis [11]. Blockade of HIF-1
significantly increases tumor radiosensitivity by enhancing
vascular destruction, thus demonstrating that HIF-1 plays
a pivotal role in tumor radioresistance [8, 12].
Previous studies demonstrated that the p42/p44
signaling pathway is involved in LMP1-induced HIF-1
protein accumulation [13]. HIF-1 stimulates angiogenesis
by up-regulating tumor cells to produce VEGF and other
proangiogenic factors, which induces angiogenesis and
protects the microvasculature from radiation-induced
endothelial apoptosis [8, 14]. We previously reported
that knocking down LMP1 could inhibit the expression
and secretion of VEGF in NPC cells [15]. However, the
molecular signaling mechanism(s) involved in LMP1induced HIF-1/VEGF activation leading to radioresistance
in NPC cells is not understood.
DNAzymes are single-stranded DNA catalysts
that can be engineered to bind to their complementary
sequence in the target messenger RNA (mRNA) and cleave
the mRNA at predetermined phosphodiester linkages [16].
These catalysts have emerged as potential drug candidates
because of their relative ease and low cost of synthesis,
high stability, and flexible rational design features [17].
DZ1 is an LMP1-targeted DNAzyme that down-regulates
the expression of LMP1 and inhibits signaling pathways
that are abnormally activated by LMP1, thereby increasing
apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation and increasing
radiosensitivity of NPC cells, which are all substantially
enhanced after treatment with a combination of DZ1
and irradiation [18]. Additional experiments showed
that DZ1 decreased ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)
production by attenuating the binding of nuclear factor
kappaB (NF-κB) to the ATM promoter and is involved in
radioresistance [19]. Recent preclinical research studies
have shown that DZ1 could down-regulate tumor vascular
permeability [20].
Despite recent advances in understanding the
molecular contribution of LMP1 to radiotherapy,
important questions remain to be answered. For example,
what are the distinct mechanisms involved in LMP1www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

induced VEGF expression? In this study, we determined
whether LMP1-mediated radioresistance in NPC occurs
through the HIF-1/VEGF pathway and elucidated the role
of JNKs/c-Jun signaling involved in LMP1-induced HIF1/VEGF activation in NPC cells.

Results
EBV-LMP1 targets DNAzyme (DZ1) inhibits
vasculature formation by down-regulating VEGF
expression and secretion
Highly aggressive cancer cells can form patterned
networks of matrix-rich tubular structures when cultured
on three-dimensional (3-D) matrices in vitro, and
these cancer cells together with endothelial cells form
microtubules [21, 22]. To determine whether microtubuleforming ability is associated with LMP1 expression and
VEGF activity, we performed a tube formation assay.
The results showed that the well-differentiated LMP1negative NPC cell line, CNE1, was not able to form
tubular structures in Matrigel, whereas two LMP1positive NPC cell lines, CNE1-LMP1 and HNE2-LMP1,
could form tubular structures. Further, CNE1-LMP1 or
HNE2-LMP1 cells and HUVEC endothelial cells could
also be connected to each other to constitute a vascular
network structure, suggesting that LMP1 might contribute
to tumor vasculature formation in NPC (Fig. 1A, I-IV).
Furthermore, the data indicated that co-cultures of CNE1LMP1 or HNE2-LMP1 cells and HUVECs did not enhance
the ability of cells to form tubular structures. This could
be because HUVECs already express high levels of VEGF
so that co-culturing HUVECs and CNE1-LMP1 cells are
not able to induce higher levels of VEGF expression,
resulting in a minimal effect on tube-formation. LMP1positive NPC cells (1×105), with down-regulated LMP1
expression, were co-cultured with HUVECs. After 8 or
24 h, the microtubule-forming ability of co-cultured cells
was decreased by approximately one-half after treatment
with DZ1 compared to control DNAzyme (CDN). This
indicates that LMP1 knock-down by DZ1 in co-cultures
resulted in reduced VEGF expression and inhibition of
tube-formation (Fig. 1A, V-VIII, B). In addition, results
showed that after treatment with DZ1, tube formation
ability was not changed, which excluded the possibility
that DZ1 might have an “off-target” effect on HUVECs
(Fig. 1A, IX-X, B).
We then used Western blotting to examine the
expression of LMP1 and VEGF proteins in co-cultured
cells. The results showed that (Fig. 1C-F) treatment of
LMP1- positive NPC cells with DZ1 reduced LMP1
expression compared to untreated control cells. The data
also showed that co-culture of HUVECs and CNE1LMP1/ HNE2-LMP1 cells did not further increase

VEGF expression. However, when LMP1 expression
was reduced, co-culturing resulted in decreased VEGF
expression, which indicates a requirement for LMP1
to maintain the expression level of VEGF in HUVECs.
Compared with the control group, the secretion of VEGF
into the medium of co-cultured cells was decreased after
DZ1 treatment (Fig. 1G, H). These results indicated that
DZ1 inhibits angiogenic activity by down-regulating
VEGF secretion.

inhibitors. The inhibitors included those acting against
several protein kinases induced by LMP1, such as the
PI3-K/AKT inhibitor (LY294002), a JAK3 inhibitor
(WHIP131), a p38 inhibitor (SB203580), a MEK
inhibitor (PD98059) and a JNKs inhibitor (SP600125)
(Fig. 2A). The results showed that in CNE1-LMP1
cells, the expression of HIF-1 and VEGF increased and
the expression of HIF-1 decreased after treatment with
SP600125. In contrast, WHIP131 demonstrated a weak
inhibitory activity, whereas the other compounds had
very little effect. Importantly, the expression of VEGF
decreased after treatment with SP600125, whereas
the other inhibitors had no obvious effect (Fig. 2B, C).
Furthermore, HRE reporter gene analysis showed that
HIF-1 activity in CNE1 cells was significantly lower than
that observed in CNE1-LMP1 cells (p < 0.05). In addition,
pharmacological inhibition of JNKs by SP600125 resulted
in significant (p < 0.05) decreases in HIF-1 activity.
Although WHIP131 demonstrated a weak inhibitory

LMP1 activates various signaling cascades involved
in proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis of NPC
tumor cells [3]. To determine which pathway is mainly
responsible for enhancing HIF-1/VEGF expression in
NPC cells, we determined the expression of HIF-1 in
CNE1-LMP1 cells treated with a variety of protein kinase

activity, the other inhibitors had no effect (Fig. 2D). These
results indicated that JNKs might be the main signaling
pathway involved in the regulation of HIF-1/VEGF in
NPC cells.
To further confirm the direct involvement of JNKs/
c-Jun signaling in the up-regulation of HIF-1 and VEGF
expression mediated by LMP1, the two LMP1-positive
NPC cell lines, CNE1-LMP1 and HNE2-LMP1, were
treated with DZ1. Western blotting results showed that
(Fig. 3A, B) phosphorylated JNKs (Thr183/ Tyr185),
total c-Jun and phosphorylated c-Jun (Ser73) were upregulated in LMP1-positive NPC cells compared to
LMP1-negative NPC cells. The total protein level of
JNKs did not change. Moreover, expression of HIF-1 and
VEGF was also up-regulated. In addition, results showed
that after treatment with DZ1, phosphorylated JNKs, c-Jun
and phosphorylated c-Jun were down-regulated, but the
total protein level of JNKs was not obviously changed
in LMP1-positive NPC cells compared to control cells.
Furthermore, the expression of HIF-1 and VEGF was also
down-regulated. In addition, HRE reporter gene analysis
revealed that (Fig. 3C, D) HIF-1 activity in CNE1-LMP1
and HNE2-LMP1 cells was significantly higher than that
observed in the corresponding LMP1-negative CNE1 and

HNE2 cells (p < 0.05). Thus, HIF-1 activity in LMP1positive NPC cells was decreased after treatment with
DZ1 compared to control cells (p < 0.05). Taken together,
these findings indicated that LMP1 could up-regulate
the phosphorylation of JNKs and c-Jun, consequently
promoting the expression of HIF-1 and further affecting
the expression of VEGF in NPC cells.
To determine whether LMP1 could affect the
expression of HIF-1 mRNA, the two LMP1-positive NPC
cell lines, CNE1-LMP1 and HNE2-LMP1, were treated
with DZ1. The level of HIF-1 mRNA was detected using
quantitative PCR, but was not significantly changed in
LMP1-positive NPC cells compared to LMP1-negative
NPC cells (Fig. 3E-H). These results indicated that LMP1
did not affect the mRNA level of HIF-1. Thus, LMP1
increases the level of the HIF-1 protein not by increasing
its transcription, but by amplifying its protein synthesis.

total HIF-1 and VEGF protein expression in NPC

Because of the role of LMP1 in regulating JNKs/
HIF-1 signaling in NPC cells, we next determined whether

LMP1-mediated phosphorylation of JNKs was associated
with HIF-1/VEGF signaling in 32 clinical patient samples.
Most of the samples presented different levels of LMP1
expression and the degree of expression of phosphorylated
JNKs, HIF-1 and VEGF varied widely among cases (Fig.
4A). Furthermore, Spearman correlation analysis of the
IHC data was performed and the relationship between
LMP1 and phosphorylated JNKs, HIF-1, and VEGF was

confirmed. The correlation coefficients for LMP1 and
phosphorylated JNKs, HIF-1 or VEGF were 0.369, 0.547
and 0.460, respectively, and the p-values were 0.038,
0.001, and 0.008, respectively (Fig. 4B). These results
indicated that a consistent positive relationship exists
between LMP1 and phosphorylated JNKs, HIF-1 or VEGF
expression.

DZ1 and SP600125 inhibit the survival of LMP1positive NPC cells after irradiation

response to radiation.

Blockade of LMP1 with DZ1 suppresses
radioresistance of NPCs

We next used the colony formation and MTS
assays to determine whether suppressing the function of
LMP1 and JNKs changes the survival of NPC cells with
irradiation. The results showed that colony formation by
LMP1-negative NPC cells, whether treated or not treated
with irradiation, was weaker than that of LMP1-positive
NPC cells, which indicated that LMP1 could increase
cellular radioresistance. After treatment with DZ1 (2 μM)
or SP600125 (20 nM), CNE1-LMP1 cells were rendered
significantly more sensitive to radiation compared to
untreated cells (Fig. 5A, B). Further, the results of an MTS
assay indicated that radiation treatment could decrease
the viability of all cell lines tested (Fig. 5C). Notably,
the viability of CNE1-LMP1 cells treated with DZ1 or
SP600125 was significantly lower compared with control
cells. Furthermore, radiation treatment combined with
DZ1 exerted a much stronger effect on viability of CNE1LMP1 cells (p < 0.01). Overall, these findings indicated
that inhibition of LMP1 or JNKs improved the tumor’s

To determine whether inhibition of LMP1 function
by DZ1 effectively induces radiosensitivity in vivo,
we treated athymic nude mice bearing CNE1-LMP1
xenografts with radiation, DZ1, or both. Treatments with
DZ1 or radiation alone mildly decreased tumor growth,
whereas combined treatment with radiation and DZ1
had an additive effect that suppressed tumor growth
significantly more than that conferred by single treatments,
(Fig. 6A, B).
We next used dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic
resonance (DCE-MRI) to determine whether inhibition
of LMP1 expression by DZ1 had any effect on tumor
microvascular permeability (Fig. 6C). The parameter
of Ktrans derived from DCE-MRI has been widely used
to evaluate anti-tumor drugs [23]. We compared the
Ktrans values of DZ1-, CDN- or saline-treated mice after
radiotherapy and found significant differences between

DZ1 and CDN (p = 0.028) or saline (p = 0.026) groups
(Fig. 6D). However, significant differences between
the DZ1 and control groups were not observed in nonirradiated animals. These results indicated that DZ1
inhibited LMP1 expression in mice, which might promote
IR-mediated changes in tumor vasculature.
Furthermore, we also used immunohistochemistry to
examine the effects of DZ1 treatment compared to CDNtreated controls. The data showed that LMP1 expression
was substantially decreased in the CNE1-LMP1 xenograft
tumors after DZ1 treated (Fig. 6E). Moreover, we found

that treatment with DZ1 resulted in decreased expression
of phosphorylated JNKs, HIF-1 and VEGF (Fig. 6E).
The relationship between LMP1 and phosphorylated
JNKs, HIF-1, and VEGF was confirmed. The correlation
coefficients for LMP1 and phosphorylated JNKs, HIF-1
or VEGF were 0.418, 0.447 or 0.393, respectively, and
the p-values were 0.018, 0.011, and 0.023, respectively
(Fig. 6F). This inhibitory effect was consistent with the
data obtained at the cellular level and from clinical patient
samples.

DZ1, CDN or SP600125 for 4 h and seeded at increasing numbers followed by irradiation at 0, 1, 2 or 4 Gy. The cells were incubated for

were fit to the data using a linear quadratic model of radiation sensitivity. (C) The effect of DZ1, CDN or SP600125 on the sensitivity of

control group. Data are shown as mean values ± S.D. of three experiments. The asterisk (* or **) indicates a significant (p < 0.05 or p <

in different cancer types. Radiation increases hypoxiainducible factor (HIF)-1 activity, which is a dominant
governor of the tumor response to irradiation mediated
by multiple mechanisms. These mechanisms include

factors by tumor cells, which results in increased
angiogenesis and protection of the microvasculature from
radiation-induced endothelial apoptosis [24]. Associations
between high levels of protein expression of HIF-1 in
tumor tissues and a poor response to radiotherapy have
been shown in multiple cancer types [25]. Moreover, HIF1 activity is increased not only by intratumoral hypoxia
but also by genetic alterations under normoxic conditions
[9]. Herein, we showed that ectopic expression of LMP1
resulted in increased HIF-1/VEGF activity acting through
the JNKs/c-Jun signaling pathway in CNE1-LMP1 cells
rendering them more resistant to irradiation. Notably,
knockdown of LMP1 by DZ1 in LMP1-positive NPC cells
induced a more radiosensitive phenotype.
LMP1 induces HIF-1 protein expression and further
amplifies VEGF expression, but this mechanism requires
further elucidation. Wakisaka et al. demonstrated that
LMP1 increases HIF-1 activity through the induction of
HIF-1 protein synthesis without increasing its mRNA
level, which is controlled by p42/p44 MAPK activity in
a lymphoblastoid cell line [13]. In our system, LMP1induced HIF-1 expression was not affected by PD98059,
a pharmacological inhibitor of p42/p44 MAPK. These
results indicated that the p42/p44 MAPK pathway is not
involved in LMP1-induced HIF-1 activity. Several studies
have reported functional interactions between increased
JNKs activation and amplified HIF-1 activity in HUVECs
and HepG2 cells [26, 27]. c-Jun reportedly cooperates
with HIF-1 to activate the transcription of VEGF in a
JNKs-phosphorylated fashion [26, 28], Thus, c-Jun could

possibly modulate the HIF-1 protein level transcriptionally
or post-transcriptionally. Herein the results showed that
DZ1 blocked activity associated with phosphorylation of
JNKs and suppressed both LMP1-induced total c-Jun and
phosphorylated c-Jun expression, consequently decreasing
HIF-1/VEGF expression. These results showed that JNKs/
c-Jun signaling plays a central role in VEGF induction
by LMP1. In addition to the level of transcription and
protein synthesis of HIF-1, stabilization is an important
consequence of post-translational modifications. HIF1 is rapidly degraded by a von Hippel-Lindau tumor
suppressor gene product (VHL)-mediated ubiquitinproteasome pathway in normoxia conditions [29] and
cobalt directly inhibits the prolylhydroxylase enzymes
that direct HIF-1 to degradation [30]. In our experimental
system, cobalt dichloride could suppress the degradation
of the HIF-1 protein; thus, future work is needed to
determine whether LMP1 specifically alters the stability
of the HIF-1 protein.
In the present study, we provided evidence showing
that LMP1 enhances protein levels of HIF-1 by amplifying
its synthesis without increasing its mRNA level. Also,
activation of the JNKs/c-Jun pathway is related to HIF1 induction by LMP1 and LMP1 induces expression and
secretion of VEGF, at least in part by activating HIF-1.
These results are consistent with reports showing that
JNKs, but not AKT, ERKs or p38 MAPK, are involved
in the regulation of HIF-1 protein levels [31-33]. In some
cases, however, AKT, ERKs, and p38 MAPK directly
phosphorylate HIF-1 to regulate its transcriptional

Figure 7: A schematic illustrating the potential DZ1 therapeutic pathways. The C-terminal activation regions (CTARs) in the
cytoplasmic C-terminus of LMP1, which directly bind TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), constitutively engage the JNKs signaling
pathways. JNKs induces synthesis of the HIF-1 protein through its downstream target, c-Jun. Further, HIF-1 activates the expression and
secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by the specific binding of HIF-1 to the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE). Then,
VEGF increases angiogenesis and radioresistance. Knocking down expression of LMP1 with DZ1 will inhibit angiogenesis and enhance
radiosensitivity through this pathway in NPC.

activity [34-36]. We believe that, depending on cell type,
only some of these kinases are activated under specific
experimental conditions.
Some aggressive tumor cells generate vasculogeniclike channels in the absence of endothelial cells
or fibroblasts and the formation of the patterned
microcirculation is termed vasculogenic mimicry (VM)
[21, 22]. In addition, cancer cells together with endothelial
cells form mosaic-like vessels. Furthermore, VM has been
described in a variety of tumor types, including melanoma,
breast, prostate, ovarian, and hepatocelluar carcinomas
[37, 38]. Some studies have shown that patients with VM
had a shorter 5-years survival rate and a higher bloodborne metastasis rate compared to non-VM patients [39,
40]. In our study, the data show that LMP1 could promote
the ability of NPC cells to form vasculature. These results
further illustrate the role of LMP1 in the tumorigenesis
and angiogenesis of NPC.
DCE-MRI is a non-invasive imaging modality that
can quantitatively evaluate tumor vascularity and tumor
vascular parameters. DCE-MRI has been developed as
a powerful tool for tumor characterization and to assess
the early efficacy of anticancer therapies, including
anti-angiogenesis and radiation therapies [41]. This
method monitors the pharmacokinetic uptake and washout of a MRI contrast agent within the extracellular
space of tumor tissues, which can be used to evaluate a
vascular permeability coefficient (Ktrans, volume transfer
constant between the blood plasma and the EES). This
has been shown to correlate with tumor perfusion and
angiogenesis. Preliminary reports have also shown that
Ktrans provides an early measure of response to therapy,
with responding tumors showing a reduction in Ktrans
values [42]. Furthermore, by measuring the in vivo tumor
vessel permeability with DCE-MRI, DZ1 was shown to
efficiently reduce Ktrans, which indicated that suppression
of LMP1 in NPCs could change tumor vasculature,
resulting in an inhibition of tumor growth and increased
radiosensitivity.
Clear advantages of DNAzyme compared to
other RNA-targeting agents include its ease of chemical
synthesis, good stability and high catalytic turnover
[43]. Recently, a clinical trial demonstrated the antitumor and radiosensitizing effects of DZ1 [17]. Here, we
demonstrated HIF-1/VEGF activation induced by LMP1
in NPC cells occurs through JNKs /c-Jun -dependent
pathways, which resulted in decreased angiogenesis and
increased radiosensitivity in NPC cells.

Experiment Laboratory. CNE1 is an LMP1-negative NPC
cell line and CNE1-LMP1 is a stable LMP1-integrated cell
line [44]. HNE2 is an LMP1-negative NPC cell line, and
HNE2-LMP1 is a cell line that constitutively expresses
LMP1 after the introduction of full-length LMP1 cDNA
[45]. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Gibco BRL,
Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). DZ1 and control DNAzyme (CDN), which
was designed based on DZ1 by introducing two mutations
in the catalytic core, were synthesized by Oligos Etc. Inc.
(Wilsonville, OR) and transfected as previously described
[19].

Tube formation assay
A matrigel tube formation assay was developed for
testing of the anti-angiogenic activity of DZ1 based on the
differentiation of HUVECs on Matrigel (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lake, NJ). Briefly, we first transfected CNE1LMP1 or HNE2-LMP1 cells with DZ1 or CDN, and 24 h
later, cells were trypsinized and centrifuged at 600 × g for
5 min. Approximately 5x104 cells and the same number of
HUVECs (total number of cells was 1×105) were seeded
in each well of a 24-well plate with 200 µl of embedded
Matrigel. Next, the cells were incubated for 8 or 24 h, and
the extent of microtubule-forming ability was examined
using low magnification microscopy.

Western blotting analysis
Proteins were extracted from cells in RIPA buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1%
NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.57 mM PMSF and
1 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein samples (50 μg) were separated
by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nylon membranes
and immunoblotted with primary antibodies. Binding
of primary antibodies was detected using peroxidase
conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz, CA)
and developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence
detection kit (Pierce ECL, Thermo Scientific, Pittsburgh,
PA.). The study employed antibodies against LMP1
(M0897, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA), c-Jun (sc-1694,
Santa Cruz, CA), phosphorylated c-Jun (Ser 73, sc7981, Santa Cruz), JNKs (9252, Cell Signaling, Beverly,
MA), phosphorylated JNKs (Thr183/Tyr185, 9251, Cell
Signaling), HIF-1(sc-53546, Santa Cruz), VEGF (sc152, Santa Cruz) and β-actin (sc-8432, Santa Cruz).

software (NIH).

(1), brown (2), and dark brown (3). Staining positivity was
determined by the formula: overall scores = percentage
score × intensity score.

Measurement of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)

Clonogenic Assay
A clonogenic assay was performed as previously
described [19]. The data were analyzed using the linearquadratic model. The surviving fraction was calculated
as the ratio of the plating efficiency of the treated cells
compared to control cells.

Cell culture medium was collected, and the
concentration of VEGF was measured using an ELISA kit
(Quantikine, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.

HIF-1 activity analysis

Cell viability assay

Cells were transfected with the HIF-1-luciferase
reporter plasmid (SABiosciences, QIAGEN, Valencia,
CA) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). After incubation for 24 h, cells were transfected with
DZ1 or CDN and were subsequently incubated with cobalt
(400 µm/L) for 24 h. Luciferase activity (Dual-Luciferase
Reporter Assay, Promega, Madison, WI) was measured
using an AutoLumat LB 9505c luminometer (Berthold
Analytical Instruments, Nashua, Germany).

Cells were cultured in 96-well plates. Cell viability
was examined using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One
Solution (MTS) Reagent (Promega, Fitchburg, WI)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Mouse xenograft model
All mice were maintained and manipulated
according to strict guidelines established by the Medical
Research Animal Ethics Committee, Central South
University, China. Six-week-old female athymic nude
mice (BALB/C) were injected with 5×106 CNE1-LMP1
cells. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula:
(length*width*height)*(π/6). When the tumor volume
reached 60–100 mm3, the animals were injected intratumorally with 100 µg of DZ1 or CDN with 3 µl of
Fugene6 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) or saline only once
every three days. In groups of mice subjected to irradiation
treatment (IR), 6 Gy local irradiation was administered at
24 h after the first DZ1 injections.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA purification and the reverse transcription
process have been previously described [46]. Quantitative
PCR was performed with iTaqTM SYBR Green Supermix
with ROX (172-5850, Bio-Rad) using an ABI 7500
instrument. The primers used to detect HIF-1 were:
5’-CGTTCCTTCGATCAGTTGTC-3’ (forward) and
5’-TCAGTGGTGGCAGTGGTAGT-3’
(reverse);
LMP1 were: 5’-CGTTATGAGTGACTGGACTGGA-3’
(forward) and 5’-TGAACAGCACAATTCCAAGG-3’
(reverse). Primers for detecting β-actin were
5’-CATGTACGTTGCTATCCAGGC-3’ (forward) and
5’-CTCCTTAATG TCACGCACGAT-3’ (reverse).

DCE-MRI Imaging
MRI was performed 3 days after DZ1 treatment.
All data were acquired on superconducting magnetic
resonance imaging scanners (Signa HDx 3.0T, GE
Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) equipped with a coil that
was 2.0 inches in diameter for animal experiments. Mice
were anesthetized using 10% chloral hydrate. DCE-MRI
scanning was performed as previously described [23]. The
raw data of DCE-MRI were analyzed using NordicICE
software (version2.3.6, NordicNeuroLab, Bergen,
Norway).

Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed
using a Histomouse SP Broad Spectrum DAB kit
(Invitrogen–Zymed, Carlsbad, CA). Paraffin sections
were immunostained using a streptavidin peroxidase
procedure after microwave antigen retrieval. The signal
was detected using a diaminobenzidine solution. The
stained sections were independently examined by two of
the authors (L.L. and D.F.). A semi-quantitative evaluation
of the positivity of each protein by IHC was performed
using a method described as follows [47]: the percentage
of positive cells was divided into five grades (percentage
scores): ≤10% (0), 11–25% (1), 26–50% (2), 51–75%(3),
and >75% (4). The intensity of staining was divided into
four grades (intensity scores): no staining (0), light brown
