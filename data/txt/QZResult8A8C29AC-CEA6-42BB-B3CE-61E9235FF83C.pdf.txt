Abstract
Introduction: Activating mutations of K-Ras gene have a well-established role as
predictors of resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in metastatic colorectal
cancer (mCRC) patients. Their prognostic value is controversial, and no data regarding
the prognostic value of mutation rate, defined as the percentage of mutated alleles/
tumor sample, are available. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of K-Ras
mutation rate in a homogenous cohort of mCRC patients receiving first-line doublet
plus bevacizumab.
Patients and Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 397 K-Ras mutant mCRC
patients from 6 Italian centers, and 263 patients were fully evaluable for our analysis.
K-Ras mutation rate was assessed by pyrosequencing. Patients with less than 60% of
cancer cells in tumor tissue were excluded. No patients received anti-EGFR containing
anticancer therapy, at any time. Median mutation rate was 40% and was adopted as
cut-off. The primary and secondary endpoints were PFS and OS respectively.
Results: At univariate analysis, K-Ras mutation rate higher than 40% was
significantly associated with lower PFS (7.3 vs 9.1 months; P < 0.0001) and OS
(21 vs 31 months; P = 0.004). A multivariate model adjusted for age at diagnosis,
site of origin of tumor tissue (primary vs metastases), referral center, number of
metastatic sites, and first-line chemotherapy backbone, showed that K-Ras mutation
rate remained a significant predictor of PFS and OS in the whole population.
Discussion: Our data demonstrate an association between K-Ras mutation
rate and prognosis in mCRC patients treated with bevacizumab-containing first-line
therapy. These data deserve to be verified in an independent validation set.

Introduction

Up to now different methods for K-Ras mutation
analysis have been used in experimental settings or in
clinical trials in order to transfer useful predictive and
prognostic information to clinical practice. Currently, the
use of more sensitive methods has significantly improved
the detection of K-Ras mutations. Interestingly while
K-Ras mutation status has been always considered a
dichotomic information, the recently use of technologies
such as pyrosequincing, allow to identify an additional
parameter i.e. the mutation rate, that is a measure of the
rate of mutant alleles. The introduction and understanding
of the biological significance and potential clinical impact
of this new parameter could represent a high priority for
patients evaluation. Indeed to our knowledge, there are
no data about prognostic and\or predictive significance
of rate of mutation of K-Ras in tumor specimens of
mCRC patients treated with bevacizumab-containing
chemotherapy in order to identify a specific subgroup of
mutant K-Ras patients receiving a significant prognostic
benefit from adding bevacizumab. We aimed to evaluate
the correlation between rate of mutation of K-Ras and
response to bevacizumab-containing treatment as well as
its prognostic effect.

The Kirsten Rat Sarcoma (K-Ras) oncogene
encodes for a 189 amino acids protein, also called p21,
a member of RAS superfamily proteins [1]. Mutations in
K-Ras gene are found in approximately 30% of all human
cancers [2] and in 35-45% of colorectal cancers (CRCs)
[3-5]. The 95% of K-Ras mutations occurs in codons 12
and 13 while mutations in codons 61, 146 and other are
less frequent in CRC, accounting for 5% of all mutations
[6]. Activating mutations of the K-Ras oncogene is an
established predictive biomarker for resistance to antiepidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) therapies
in metastatic CRC (mCRC). Even though selection of Ras
wild type (i.e. K-Ras and N-Ras exons 2, 3 and 4) greatly
improve efficacy of EGFR-targeted agents by excluding
50% to 60% of patients with tumors refractory to EGFR
blockade [7-8], molecular alterations in additional nodes
of the EGFR signalling network also seem to be clinically
relevant. Among these, downstream mutations such as in
B-Raf and PIK3CA genes have been investigated through
several sequencing methods [9-11].
Despite of the well known importance of K-Ras
mutations as predictive factor to anti-EGFR drugs
administration, there is no consensus about the prognostic
value of mutational status of K-Ras in CRC patients.
Several reports have indicated that K-Ras mutations
are negative prognostic markers and portend a poorer
outcome in CRC [12] and a meta-analysis of 3439
patients reported that mutation on codon 12 glycine to
valine has a statistically significant impact on failurefree survival (FFS) (P = 0.004, HR:1.3) and overall
survival (OS) (P = 0.008, HR:1.29) and it is associated
with a more aggressive biological behaviour of tumor
[13]. A retrospective analysis of FOCUS trial showed
that activating mutation in K-Ras and B-Raf oncogene
are associated with shorter survival: patients harbouring
K-Ras mutation have worse OS than patients with K-Ras
wt tumors (HR:1.24; 95%CI:1,06-1.46; P = 0.008), but
there is no evidence of an effect on progression free
survival (PFS) (HR:1.14; 95%CI:0,98-1.33; P = 0.09)
[14]. A recent post hoc analysis of the TRIBE study
confirmed the negative prognostic role of K-Ras mutation
in patients with mCRC treated with bevacizumab; more
in details: the OS of all wt Ras patients was 34.4 months
and 41.7 months when they received bevacizumab and
FOLFIRI or bevacizumab and FOLFOXIRI respectively
(HR: 0.84, 95%CI: 0.51-1.38), while the OS of mutant
Ras patients was 23.1 months and 28.6 months when they
received bevacizumab and FOLFIRI or bevacizumab
and FOLFOXIRI [15] respectively (HR: 0.86, 95%CI:
0.61 to 1.23). The PFS of all Ras wt patients was 11.3
months vs 13.3 months in Ras mutant patients treated
with bevacizumab and FOLFIRI or bevacizumab and
FOLFOXIRI.

Results
Patients’ population
In this study we recruited 397 patients; 92 patients
were excluded because of insufficient percentage of tumor
cells in tissue samples (< 60%) and other 42 patients
because of incomplete follow up or other missing data.
We totally analyzed a population of 263 patients, 144
(54.6%) male and 119 (43.4%) female. The Figure 1
provides an overview diagram indicating the number of
patients enrolled and analyzed in this study (Figure 1).
K-Ras determination was performed on primary tumors
for 69 (26.2%) patients and on metastatic cancer sites for
194 (73.8%). The results showed that mutant codon 12
was present in 211 (80%) patients, mutant codon 13 in
44 (17%) patients, while other rare mutations of K-Ras
were present in 8 (3%) patients. All enrolled subjects
have available data about bevacizumab-chemotherapy
regimens, in particular all patients received bevacizumab;
201 (76.4%) patients received a first-line containing
irinotecan, while 62 (23.6%) an oxaliplatin containing
schedule. Among the whole population 191 (72.6%)
of patients experienced a second-line therapy and 122
(46.4%) a third line. The majority of patients who showed
one organ compromised were 178 (67.7%), multi-organ
involvement refer to 49 (18.6%) patients with two organs
implicated, while 36 (13.7%) subjects presented 3 or more
interested organs. Objective tumor response (achieved

with a mutation rate > 40% was 109, while that of patients
with a mutation rate < 40% was 154. The survival data
were then used for the univariate analysis using the log
rank test. We obtain that higher mutation rate resulted in
a poor outcome in terms of PFS and OS. In particular the
median PFS for mutant K-Ras patients was 8.25 months
(95%CI: 7.48-9.01), but the PFS in mutant codon 12
patients with < 40% of mutation rate was 9.45 months
(95%CI: 8.47-10.42) and that with ≥ 40% was 7.5 months
(95%CI: 5.78-9.21). The median PFS in mutant codon 13
K-Ras patients was 8.9 months (95%CI: 7.69-10.10), the
median PFS in mutant codon 13 K-Ras patients with <
40% and ≥ 40% was 10.25 months (95%CI: 8.15-12.34)
and 7.25 months (95%CI: 14.40-43.59) respectively. The
median PFS for other K-Ras mutations was 5.5 months
(95%CI: 2.95-8.04), while the PFS for < 40% and ≥ 40%
patients was 7.25 months (95%CI: 2.44-12.05) and 5.5

Prognostic value of mutant K-Ras alleles:
univariate analysis
In order to investigate the prognostic value of K-Ras
mutation rate we firstly performed a survival analysis for
the calculation of PFS and OS. We divided subjects into
three groups: those mutated in codon 12, 13 and those
with mutation on K-Ras rare codons. Each group was then
dichotomized for the presence of a mutation rate higher or
lower than 40%; the total number of the analyzed patients

and OS, we also applied a Cox’s regression model with
these factors included in order to estimate the independent
effect of the mutation rate on the two outcomes. This
unadjusted analysis provide the following results: for
PFS an HR = 0.63 (95%CI: 0.46-0.80) with a P < 0.001,
and for OS an HR = 0.66 (95%CI: 0.44-0.84) with a P
= 0.004. Moreover the multivariate Cox proportional
hazards analysis, performed to compare prognostic
factors of survival after adjustment for the impact of other
factors (age at diagnosis, tumor tissue used for molecular
analysis, reference center, number of metastatic sites, firstline chemotherapy) displayed a significative association
between mutation rate and the two outcome’ predictors
(for PFS: HR: 0.67, 95%CI: 0.53-0.82, P = 0.003; for
OS: HR: 0.67, 95%CI: 0.53-0.82, P = 0.003). Finally, we
investigate the independent effect of mutation rate (more
or less than 40% mutant alleles) of codons 12, 13 and rare
codons introducing them into the multivariate analysis;
among these only codon’ 12 mutation rate present a
significant association with PFS (HR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.520.85, P = 0.003) and OS (HR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.52-0.85, P
= 0.003).
Overall, these results demonstrated that K-Ras
alleles mutation rate remained a significant predictor of
PFS and OS (codon 13 and rare codons did not reach
statistical significance probably due to the low number of
patients) (Table 3).

months (95%CI: 2.68-7.76) in that order. Regarding the
median survival, OS of mutant K-Ras patients treated
with a first line bevacizumab-containing treatment was 26
months (95%CI: 22.03-29.97). The median OS of mutant
codon 12 patients was 28 months (95%CI: 23.67-32.32),
but the OS in mutant codon 12 patients with < 40% was
31 months (95%CI: 27.00-34.99), while the OS in mCRC
patients with codon 12 K-Ras mutation ≥ 40% was 23
months (95%CI: 19.79-26.20). The median OS in mutant
codon 13 patients was 21 months (95%CI: 16.63-25.36);
the OS in mutant codon 13 K-Ras patients with < 40%
and ≥ 40% was 24 months (95%CI: 19.41-28.58) and 17
months (95%CI: 11.61-22.78) respectively. The OS of
other rare mutant codons K-Ras patients was 31 months.
In the univariate survival analysis, the patients with a
mutation rate higher than 40% was significantly associated
with both PFS (log-rank P = 0.000) and OS (log-rank P
= 0.002) with PFS and OS median value indicative of
worse survival (median PFS: 7.25 months (95%CI: 5.768.73) vs 9 months (95%CI: 7.96-10.03) and median OS:

26.66-35.33)) correspondingly. The different subgroups
survival data and Kaplan Meier curves are shown in Table
2 and Figure 2.
A bioinformatic analysis was also conducted on a
separate cohort consisting of 20 patients radically resected
for liver metastasis and treated with chemotherapy. Taking
advantage of the availability of primary and matched liver
metastasis samples, we performed a correlation analysis
finding a positive association (P = 0.030) between K-Ras
mutation rate on the two sites. A subsequent Kaplan
Meier survival analysis did not find any ability of K-Ras
mutation allele frequency in predicting OS (P = 0.88),
but we found that the cut-off (35%) generated through
ROC method was very close to the one (40%) we used to
dichotomize our cohort.

Discussion
In the era of personalized medicine, the improved
understanding of the EGFR pathway clarified that
mutations of Ras genes are established negative predictive
factors with regard to the use of anti-EGFR monoclonal
antibodies. Not only the negative predictive value of
K-Ras exon 2 mutations was validated in a number of
studies [3, 5], but also the analysis of other mutations
such as codon 61 in exon 3 and codon 146 in exon 4 may
predict resistance to these drugs [16]. Moreover, since
tumors harbouring any Ras mutation do not respond
to cetuximab or panitumumab [17], an expanded Ras
analysis, including N-Ras exon 2, 3 and 4, has been

incorporated in the baseline evaluation of mCRC patients
before treatment selection and the use of anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibodies has been restricted to patients with
Ras wild-type tumors.
Oppositely, the influence of K-Ras mutations on
overall patients’ outcome is much less evident, indeed its
prognostic value for patients with colorectal cancer is still
debated. Even if K-Ras mutations seem not to correlate
with the prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer the
association remains to be confirmed with a more precise
analysis of a large sample [18].
One of the reasons of these inconclusive results
can be also attributed to cancer heterogeneity. Many
tumors present heterogeneity within their cell population.
This lack of cellular homogeneity may arise because
of differential nutrient status due to an altered cancer
induced microcirculations, normal cells’ infiltration into
the tumor mass and to the hierarchical natures of the cell
populations from which cancers arise. Recent findings
demonstrated the complexity of settle and understand
the heterogeneity of malignant disease, especially in
an advanced setting. Some authors suggested that the
molecular profile of the primary tumor might significantly
differ from that of a corresponding metastatic site and
might not reflect molecular aberrations accumulated as
a consequence of selection pressure caused by applied
cancer therapies. In addition, the molecular profile(s) of
different metastatic sites might be disparate [19-21]. The
molecular discordances between anatomic site locations
of the same patient may hence reflect cancer heterogeneity
[22]. Despite these data, other scientific reports established
that, especially in patients never exposed to anti-EGFRs,
the rate of concordance between primary tumor and

corresponding metastatic sites is very high [23-25], and
our data are in accordance with those findings. Moreover
in the cancers’ genetic heterogeneity scenario is important
to take into account that the percentage of K-Ras mutated
cells into the tumor mass can vary from one patient to
another and this fact may substantially influence the ability
to predict therapeutic response [26].
Our work includes a large, multi-institutional cohort,
involving 263 real-world patients and aims to define the
prognostic value of K-Ras mutation rate in a homogeneous
population of patient treated with a first-line containing
bevacizumab. We decided to consider PFS as the primary
endpoint of the study because of its shorter available
follow-up time and its independence from additional
subsequent therapies, which preserved the homogeneity
of our patients’ population. Furthermore, some correlation
analysis showed associations between PFS and OS in
some cancers such as mCRC [27].
We should also admit some limits; first of all the
greatest bias of our work derives from the retrospective
nature of the study itself. We decided to exclude from
the analysis 92 patients because insufficient percentage
of tumor cells contained in their samples and other 42
cases because of incomplete follow-up data: this caused a
loss of 33% of the original cohort in the final analyses. In
addition, the cut-off of 40% (median value) was arbitrarily
chosen and not independently validated. Finally despite
we used pyrosequencing to assess the mutational status
of all patients, the analysis was performed in different
laboratory. On the contrary the lack of detection of B-Raf
and N-Ras mutations due to their mutually exclusive
nature do not represent a limit.
In the first prognostic analysis we confirm the

unfavorable K-Ras impact on both survival endpoints;
interestingly these results were replicated when we
investigated the effect of the mutation rate higher than
40% (chosen as cut-off value) on PFS and OS (PFS; P
= 0.000; OS; P = 0.002), independently of the type of
mutation. This strong association emerged in each class
of patients analyzed, grouped on the basis of the type
of mutation (codon 12, 13 or rare codons), indeed PFS
and OS was always higher (in terms of months) in those
groups of patients with less than 40% of mutation rate,
providing indication of a better survival.
These data encouraged us to apply a multivariate
model for the evaluation of the independent effect of
mutation rate of codons 12, 13 and rare codons. The
analysis’ results showed that the prognostic value of exon
2/3 K-Ras mutations is retained after correction for other
well-known prognostic factors (age at diagnosis, tumor
tissue used for molecular analysis, reference center,
number of metastatic sites and first-line chemotherapy)
and confirm the robustness of the mutation rate as an
effective predictor of PFS and OS.
In conclusion our results demonstrate for the first
time a correlation between the K-Ras mutation rate
(presence of more or less than 40% mutant alleles) in
a homogenous advanced CRC population treated with
bevacizumab containing first-line regimens. Certainly,
our data need to be confirmed in a validation prospective
set, but represent an important proof of concept for future
translational analyses.

pyrosequencing) and treated with first-line anticancer
regimens containing bevacizumab. Two clinical endpoints
were used: PFS was the time from start of treatment to
first evidence of tumor progression or death; OS was the
time from start of treatment to death from any cause. The
study has been conducted in accordance with the ethical
principles that have their origin in the current Declaration
of Helsinki and it has been approved by the ethical
committee of Campus Bio-Medico of Rome. This study
satisfy the REMARK criteria [28].

treated with chemotherapy were selected for further
analysis. Cut-off estimation for Kaplan Meier analysis
for OS was performed through Receiving Operator Curve
methods using Cutoff Finder (http://molpath.charite.de/
cutoff/).

All tumor samples (belonging to primary tumor or
metastatic lesions) used in this study were selected and
dissected by an experienced pathologist, and were quality
controlled by frozen section to ensure that tumor cells
were present in at least 60% of the sample. FFPE sections
were deparaffinised by submersion in xylene; the tissue
was then incubated overnight at 56°C with Proteinase
K (Qiagen, UK) to allow samples lysis and DNA was
extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. To obtain RNAfree genomic DNA, an RNase A (Qiagen, UK) treatment
was performed following the protocol instructions.
The concentration and purity of the isolated DNA were
measured using a NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, DE, USA). Pyrosequencing
analysis was performed by each local laboratory with the
exception of cases provide by ASB that were analysed
by the coordinating centre. Pyrosequencing analysis of
K-Ras status was carried out on 0.15-0.5 pmol of each
PCR product using the PyroMark MD System (Qiagen)
following the manufacturer’s instructions, with sequencing
primers and assay parameters specific to each mutation.
Codons 12, 13, 61, 117 and 146 of K-Ras gene were
analysed. For each assay, pyrosequencing analysis was
taken to represent the identified percentage burden of the
mutant allele. The cut-off value, discriminating between
the mutant and wild-type sequence, was arbitrarily
assigned as 10% mutant allele burden. A score for each
mutant sequence was used for statistical analysis; in
particular we assigned score 0 whether mutant K-Ras
alleles were present in less than 40% while score 1 whether
mutant K-Ras alleles were present in at least 40%. The
determination of 40% as cut off value of allelic frequency
was established because it represented the median value of
the percentage’ distribution of mutant alleles.

until documentation of radiological or symptomatic
disease progression. The OS time was calculated as the
period from the date of starting treatment until death
from any cause or until the date of the last follow-up, at
which point data were censored. PFS and OS were both
determined by Kaplan-Meier product-limit method.
Finally, the Cox proportional hazards model was applied
to the multivariate survival analysis. Survival analysis
in multivariate model was corrected for the following
variables: age at diagnosis, tumor tissue used for molecular
analysis, reference center, number of metastatic sites and
chemotherapy regimen in first line. The cut-off point for
survival data was May 2014. SPSS software (version
17.00, SPSS, Chicago) was used for statistical analysis.
A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate
statistical significance.
