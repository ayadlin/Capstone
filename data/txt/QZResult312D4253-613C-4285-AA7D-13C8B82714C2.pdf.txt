ABSTRACT
In this study, we have characterized the role of annexin A1 (ANXA1) in the
acquisition and maintenance of stem-like/aggressive features in prostate cancer
(PCa) cells comparing zoledronic acid (ZA)-resistant DU145R80 with their parental
DU145 cells. ANXA1 is over-expressed in DU145R80 cells and its down-regulation
abolishes their resistance to ZA. Moreover, ANXA1 induces DU145 and DU145R80
invasiveness acting through formyl peptide receptors (FPRs). Also, ANXA1 knockdown
is able to inhibit epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and to reduce focal
adhesion kinase (FAK) and metalloproteases (MMP)-2/9 expression in PCa cells.
DU145R80 show a cancer stem cell (CSC)-like signature with a high expression of CSC
markers including CD44, CD133, NANOG, Snail, Oct4 and ALDH7A1 and CSC-related
genes as STAT3. Interestingly, ANXA1 knockdown induces these cells to revert from a
putative prostate CSC to a more differentiated phenotype resembling DU145 PCa cell
signature. Similar results are obtained concerning some drug resistance-related genes
such as ATP Binding Cassette G2 (ABCG2) and Lung Resistant Protein (LRP). Our study
provides new insights on the role of ANXA1 protein in PCa onset and progression.

[4–6]. These anti-tumoral effects of ZA might be mainly
due to its ability to inhibit farnesylpyrophosphate synthase
(FPPS), a key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway that has
been implicated in various aspects of carcinogenesis [7, 8].
Recent studies from our group have reported
that in a ZA-resistant sub-line of DU145 PCa cells, the
DU145R80 cells, continuous extensive exposure to ZA
could activate the p38-MAPK pathway. This activation
has a critical role in the induction of the resistance, as well
as in the acquisition of a more aggressive and invasive
phenotype of these cells if compared to their DU145
parental ones [9]. Moreover, in the ZA chemo-resistant
DU145R80 PCa cells we identified a homogeneous group
of 15 proteins differently expressed that were associated,
for the most part, with regulation of cell morphology,
cytoskeletal organization, cell movement and/or cell-to-cell

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the prevailing cancer in
US and European men and the second cause of cancer
death in those populations [1]. The standard of care for
PCa patients is routinely based on androgen suppression
(medical or surgical castration), however, all men who
undergo this treatment may develop castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPCa) [2, 3].
The nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate (N-BP)
zoledronic acid (ZA) is at present used in oncological
practice to reduce skeletal related events (SREs) and
pain associated to bone metastases of several cancers,
including PCa. Moreover, accumulated evidences have
shown that ZA may improve patient survival, reduce
cancer progression and exert potent anti-tumor effects

interaction: one of these significantly deregulated proteins
was identified as annexin A1 (ANXA1) [10].
ANXA1 is a 37 kDa protein able to bind (i.e. to annex)
to cellular membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The
protein was originally reported for its anti-phospholipase
activity following glucocorticoid induction however,
subsequent studies from our group and others showed
that ANXA1 possesses a wide range of physiological and
pathological functions [11–16], some of whom correlate to
cancer development [17–21].
Several studies have showed ANXA1 dysregulation
in PCa. Interestingly, although overall ANXA1 expression
in this tumor seems to be unaffected [22–25] or more
commonly reduced [26–31], publicly available cancer
microarray databases from Oncomine (http://www.
oncomine.org) have shown an increase in ANXA1 exp­
ression in the more aggressive tumors [32–36].
ANXA1 biological effects could differ on varying
of its intra- and extra-cellular localization [37]. Cytosolic
ANXA1 for example has been frequently implicated in
cytoskeletal organization since the protein binds F-actin
and profilin at level of cell movement structures like
lamellipodia and phillopodia, at membrane ruffles and at
cell-cell contact points in several cellular models [38–39,
12]. The extracellular form of ANXA1 has been as well
described to stimulate cell motility and cancer cell invasion
capability, mostly interacting with specific receptors
[13, 40]. These have been identified as members of the
G-protein coupled formyl peptide receptor (FPRs) family
that is involved for the most part in cell motility [41].
Finally, ANXA1 dysregulation has also been found
to be associated with increased resistance to several
anticancer drugs, including adriamycin, melphalan and
etoposide, although the mechanism or mechanisms by
which ANXA1 contributes to drug resistance are not fully
understood, neither it is clear whether this is a general
mechanism of drug resistance or is specific to particular
drugs or drug classes [37, 42].
In this study, we have investigated the role of
ANXA1 in the acquisition of a more aggressive phenotype
in PCa cells comparing ZA-sensitive DU145 cell line
with the ZA-resistant derived sub-population DU145R80.
We show that in DU145R80 PCa cells ANXA1 downregulation determines a loss of ZA-resistance, produces
significant changes in cell morphology, induces a partial
reversion of the Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition
(EMT), reduces the ability of these cells to spread and
leads to the lack of some phenotypic features including
cancer stem cell (CSC)- and drug resistance-related ones.

ZA-resistant PCa cells compared with their parental
DU145 cells [10]. Thus, we first evaluated the role of
ANXA1 in the maintenance of drug resistance to ZA in
DU145R80 PCa cells.
As we showed elsewhere [9], the ZA-resistant
DU145R80 cell line have a significantly higher IC50
compared with parental DU145 cells (109.28 ± 1.3 versus
21.3 ± 0.4, respectively; p < 0.0001), resulting in more
than fivefold resistance to ZA (Resistance Index (RI) =
5.1) (Figure 1A, 1B). Interestingly, ANXA1 knockdown
obtained by using specific siRNAs against ANXA1
(siANXA1) abolishes resistance to ZA in DU145R80
PCa cell line (IC50 26.1 ± 0.97; p < 0.0001) (Figure 1B),
suggesting that ANXA1 mediated ZA-resistance in our
experimental model.
DU145R80 ZA-resistant PCa population also
showed a very aggressive phenotype characterized by
increased invasive capability [9].
Since extracellular occurrence of ANXA1 (cell
surfaces and supernatants) has been consistently described
to have several physiological and pathological functions
[13, 40], we characterized ANXA1 expression and
localization in sub-cellular compartments of DU145 and
DU145R80 cells by 1-D Western Blotting (Figure 1C) and
immunofluorescence analyses (Figure 1D, panels a–f).
Our results show that in both DU145 and DU145R80
cells ANXA1 was detectable in cytosol, membrane and
extracellular compartments underlining an overall protein
up-regulation in DU145R80 sub-line. Interestingly, only
DU145R80 cells exhibit a strong cleavage of ANXA1,
mainly in the extracellular environments (Figure 1C).
Additional analyses of ANXA1 sub-cellular
localization obtained by confocal microscopy in DU145
and DU145R80 cells confirmed the membrane and
cytosolic expression of ANXA1 in both cell populations
and the increase of the protein in DU145R80 subline (Figure 1D, panels a; d). In this latter, the results
highlighted ANXA1 enrichment in the cellular regions
potentially assigned to cell motility, like phillopodia
(Figure 1D, panel d; arrows).

ANXA1 knockdown significantly reduced
invasion capability of DU145 and ZA-resistant
DU145R80 cells
Dynamic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton
leads to the development of extending protrusions in the
direction of cellular motility and represents the central
mechanism underlying cell invasiveness [43]. Cellular
invasion can be triggered by numerous molecular signals,
that are perceived by receptors on the cell surface or
within cells to activate a motility response [44].
DU145R80 cells showed both enrichment
of ANXA1 protein in cell actin-rich regions and
extracellularly (cell surfaces and supernatants) and these
sub-cellular localizations had been consistently described
to stimulate cancer cell invasion and metastasis [17, 40].

cells were treated with different concentrations of ZA (from 1 up to 200 μM) for 96 h. IC50 was evaluated by MTT colorimetric assay (see
Materials and Methods). Absorbance relative to controls was used to determine the percentage of remaining viable cancer cells following
their treatment with varying concentrations of ZA compound, which is translated to the ZA cytotoxicity and its IC50 values. Values are the

Therefore, we next analyzed the role of ANXA1 in these
processes by down-regulating the expression of the
protein in DU145 and DU145R80 cells by siANXA1
(Figure 2A). As shown in Figure 2B (representative bright
field pictures) and Figure 2C we confirmed, by a matrigel
invasion assay, higher invasive ability of DU145R80
compared to DU145 and showed that ANXA1 knockdown
markedly suppressed the invasiveness of both PCa cell
lines.

reduce in a significant manner DU145 and DU145R80
cell invasiveness.
Interestingly, when treated with Ac2-26 (1  μM)
and fMLP (50 nM), DU145 (Figure 4C, 4E) and
DU145R80 (Figure 4D, 4F) cells showed an increase
in invasion through the coating of matrigel. In both of
cases, experimental points were compared with non
treated controls, with cells treated by the selective FPR-1
antagonist cyclosporin H (CsH; 500 nM) or the selective
FPR-2 antagonist WRW4 (10 μM) (Figure 4E, 4F).
Altogether our data confirmed the functional
engagement of FPR receptors by ANXA1 in regulating
invasion in both DU145 and DU145R80 cells and
suggested a predominant role of ANXA1/FPR-2 bond in
mediating DU145R80 aggressive behavior.

Secreted ANXA1 induces PCa cell invasion
acting through FPRs in DU145 and in ZAresistant DU145R80
Regulatory action of extracellular ANXA1 is
reported to be mediated by signaling through FPRs [17,
19, 37].
Therefore, we evaluated FPR expression in DU145
and DU145R80 cells by cytofluorimetric analysis
(Figure 3A): we found that FPR-1 was similarly expressed
in both cell populations whereas FPR-2 was mainly found
in DU145R80 sub-line.
Several lines of evidence exist reporting that
ANXA1-nFPR bond results in a series of cellular
responses, such as the increase of intracellular Ca2+
concentration.
Differently from full length ANXA1 that only bound
FPR2, the N-terminal mimetic peptide of ANXA1, Ac226, can activate all three human FPRs, promoting calcium
fluxes, and cell locomotion [41]. Thus, we analyzed the
stimulated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores in
DU145 and DU145R80 cells by treating cells with Ac226 peptide.
Cells were incubated in Ca2+ free medium and
treated with the fluorescent calcium indicator Fluo2AM before addition of Ac2-26 (1 μM) or the natural
FPR agonist fMLP (50 nM) together or not with the
FPR pharmacological antagonist Boc-1 (10 μM) that
is able to antagonize all three human FPR isoforms.
The spectrofluorimetric assay (Figure 3B) showed that
fMLP and Ac2-26 peptide induced intracellular Ca2+
release in both DU145 and DU145R80 cells while
no important differences between ionomycin (used
as reference compound) and fMLP or Ac2-26 were
detected. The effects of fMLP and Ac2-26 peptides
were inhibited by the pharmacological nFPR antagonist
Boc-1.
To evaluate if the pro-invasive role of ANXA1 in
our PCa models is mediated by its ability to activate FPRs,
as previously reported in pancreas and colon carcinomas
[17, 40], we performed a matrigel invasion assay using an
anti-ANXA1 blocking antibody and by stimulating or not
DU145 and DU145R80 cells by administration of Ac2-26
peptide.
As showed in Figures 4A (representative bright
fields) and 4B ANXA1 blocking antibody was able to

DU145R80 aggressive phenotype strictly
correlated with ANXA1 expression
Cancer cells that are characterized by a more
aggressive and invasive phenotype usually undergo EMT.
This process drives actin polymerization and the assembly
of matrix-degrading structures termed invadopodia that
interface with adhesion and matrix metalloproteases
(MMPs) allowing migration away from the tumor site
[45].
Preceding analyses performed by Milone et al. [10]
showed marked differences in cell morphology between
DU145R80 and their parental DU145 cells resulting in a
more invasive phenotype of the ZA-resistant sub-line.
As previously reported, ANXA1 has been frequently
implicated in cytoskeletal organization and in the acquisition
of cancer cell invasion as a modulator for EMT like
phenotypic switch via the transforming growth factor (TGF)
signaling pathway [40, 46]. Therefore, we next investigated
the effects of ANXA1 knockdown on the expression of
some proteins involved in EMT/invasion processes and
on morphological features of DU145 and ZA-resistant
DU145R80 cells, using Western blotting and confocal
microscopy (Figure 5). All experiments were performed in
cells treated or not with scrambled or anti-ANXA1 siRNAs,
as described in Materials and Methods section.
1-D Western blotting results showed that differently
from DU145, DU145R80 cells had undetectable
E-cadherin and high vimentin, MMP-2 and MMP-9
expression (Figure 5A) confirming our previous
observations [9, 10]. As also reported before, confocal
microscopy analyses showed that DU145 cells were
characterized by a more epithelial-like morphology:
in these cells F-actin staining showed a well organized
cytoskeleton with the appearance of several cortical
stress fibers (Figure 5B, panel b; arrows), suggesting
a less motile phenotype. In contrast, DU145R80 cells
assumed a smaller, rounded morphology, with reduced
cell-cell contact regions and the appearance of membrane
condensed actin-rich structures resembling invadopodia

(Figure 5B, panel e; arrows), in agreement with their
reported mesenchymal features [9, 10]. Interestingly,
in DU145R80 but not in DU145 cells a marked colocalization of ANXA1 with cytoskeletal actin was
evident, mainly at membrane level (Figure 5B, panels a–c,
d–f). Contextually, we confirmed the increase, as well as
a better filamentous-like organization of vimentin in ZAresistant DU145R80 cells (Figure 5B, panels g–i, l–n)
where we also detected a high activation of focal adhesion
kinase (FAK), a protein commonly expressed in adhesion
hot spots of migrating/invasive cells (Figure 5B, panels
o–q, r–t).
A completely different scenarios was disclosed in
DU145 and DU145R80 cells when ANXA1 expression
was significantly inhibited by siRNAs. In the latter
conditions, an overall reversion from EMT to MET
features was observed by 1-D Western blotting analyses
equally in DU145 and DU145R80 cell populations.
ANXA1 knockdown resulted indeed in E-cadherin
increase and in vimentin, MMP-2 and -9 reduction in both
PCa cell populations. Moreover, confocal microscopy
observations highlighted an evident loss in cytoskeletal
and vimentin organization and a marked reduction of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

FAK expression (Figure 5B, panels a’–f’, g’–n’, o’–t’) in
siANXA1 treated cells. Altogether these data suggest a
critical and hierarchical role of ANXA1 in the regulation
of a mesenchymal pro-invasive phenotype in the more
aggressive-ZA resistant DU145R80 cells compared to
parental DU145 cells.

ANXA1 expression correlates with CSC-like
phenotype in ZA-resistant DU145R80 PCa cells
Many tumors are extensively heterogeneous by
a histological point of view, with sub-populations of
tumor cells characterized by distinct molecular profiles
[47]. Tumors may also include CSCs, rare cancer
cells (generally <1% on total cells in a tumor mass)
with indefinite potential for self-renewal that drive
tumorigenesis. To date, the possible existence of CSCs
has been identified in several solid malignancies including
PCa, revealing the critical role of these cells in metastasis
and drug resistance [48, 49].
Our experimental observations suggested that
DU145R80 cells display two features of CSCs lacking in their
parental counterparts such as increased invasive capability

were enriched for CSCs, using a number of approaches.
At first, as shown in Figure 6A we demonstrated
in DU145R80 a clear mRNA over expression of Oct4,
NANOG and Snail, all markers characteristic of PCa
cancer stem cells [50, 51].

Next, we showed by flow cytofluorimetric analyses
an enrichment of CD44high/CD24low and CD44high/CD133high
cells which are considered a distinct sub-population
of early progenitor/SCs in PCa tumors, in DU145R80
(Figure 6B, red squares) compared to DU145 cells
(Figure 6B, green squares) [52].

We next investigate possible effects of ANXA1
knockdown on CSC signature in both DU145 and
aggressive DU145R80 PCa cell lines.
Thus, we analyzed mRNA levels of Oct4, NANOG
and Snail in both upon ANXA1 knockdown. Interestingly,
48 h following transfection with siANXA1 we observed a
significant reduction of NANOG mRNA levels in both DU145
and DU145R80 ANXA1 knockdown cells (Figure  7A)
whereas no considerable differences were observed in Oct4
and Snail transcription levels (data not shown).
High ALDH7A1 that we have previously demon­
strated to be up-regulated in DU145R80 cells compared
to DU145 [10], together with CD44high/CD24low, NANOG
and Oct4 expression has been reported by several studies
to identify CSC phenotype in human PCa [53–59]. In
fact, ALDH7A1 affects a number of genes and factors
involved in migration, invasion and metastasis, including
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

transcription factors such as Snail1/2 and can be used to
identify tumor-initiating and metastasis-initiating cells in
various human carcinomas, including PCa. Notably, we
confirmed the up-regulated ALDH7A1 in DU145R80
cells (Figure 7B) compared to parental DU145 cells and
showed that ANXA1 knockdown was able to reduce its
expression only in ZA-resistant PCa sub-line (Figure 7B).
Hereafter, we performed 1-D Western blot analyses
of expression profiles of some protein involved in different
ways in CSC signature, gain and maintenance and/or
related drug resistance capability.
The connection between JAK2/STAT3 pathway
activation and CSCs has been highlighted in a previous
work on ovarian cancer, where the SC marker CD44
together with the embryonic SC marker NANOG have been
associated with the activation of STAT3 [60]. As expected,
in ZA-resistant DU145R80 cells we found a higher STAT3

phosphorylation compared with their parental DU145 cells
that to the contrary was significantly reduced in DU145R80
ANXA1 knockdown cells (Figure 7B).
Subsequently, as MAPK/ERK signaling pathway
has been linked to metastasis [61], EMT [62], and to
cancer SC/tumor initiating cells [63], we analyzed by 1-D
Western blot the phosphorylation of extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) which is a measure of activated
ERK, in not treated and ANXA1 knockdown PCa cells.
Our results showed that only DU145R80 had high
activation level of ERK that again was strongly reduced
in siANXA1 treated cells (Figure 7B).
It is well documented that CSCs express high levels of
drug resistance proteins that explain side-population features.
The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins
represent the largest family of trans-membrane proteins
to confer drug resistance to tumor cells, and in particular,
ABC transporter-subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1/MDR1/
P-glycoprotein, P-gp), subfamily C member 1 (ABCC1/
MRP1) and subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2/BCRP) are
considered to be the most important transporters [64].
Additional proteins that seems to be important in stimulating
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the development of multidrug resistance in cancer cells are
the Major Vault Proteins (MVP) and, in particular, the Lung
Resistance Protein (LRP) [65]. Repeated immunoblotting
analysis indicated consistent differences between DU145
and DU145R80 in the expression of ABCG2/BCRP, while
apparently neither of the cell lines expressed MDR1 or MRP1
(data not shown). In addition, DU154R80 cells showed a
clear over-expression of LRP compared to DU145 cells
(Figure 7B). Interestingly, ANXA1 knockdown reduces this
protein expression only in ZA-resistant sub-line whereas their
amount appeared to be unaffected in DU145 parental cell line
(Figure 7B). Altogether these data suggest a critical role of
ANXA1 in regulating CSC phenotype in our PCa models.

DISCUSSION
The cell-origin theory for intratumoral heterogeneity
proposes that tumor initiation from distinct cell types in
the lineage hierarchy gives rise to tumor subtypes with
different prognoses and/or treatment responses [66, 67]. In
PCa, this model has not been methodically investigated as
for other tumor types, although several reports investigated

PCa putative stem cell-like cells [48, 50, 52, 53, 55–59].
PCa is composed of phenotypically exocrine, luminal, and
dispersed neuroendocrine cells. It was long believed that
this tumor lacked basal cells, as many investigators had
shown the absence of basal cell keratins and that cancer
initiating cells were therefore of luminal origin [68–70].
However, relatively recent evidences from the
mouse suggested the existence of a third epithelial cell
type derived from the basal layer, identified by expression
of both the “basal” keratin K5 together with the “luminal”
keratin K18 and therefore known as “intermediate”
population. The identification in PCa primary tumors of
these transiently proliferating/amplifying cells which are
intermediate to SCs and fully differentiated cells [71]
implicate both luminal [72] and basal cells [73–75] in PCa
initiation. This has been involved in CRPCa and drugresistance insurgency as expansion and differentiation
of these transiently proliferating/amplifying cells during
androgen deprivation therapy might subsequently lead to
androgen-independent progression of PCa [75, 76, 53].
The association of intermediate cells with CRCP
was also reflected in cell lines. While the androgendependent cell line LNCaP expressed only K18, the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

androgen-independent cell lines PC3 and DU145 express
both K5 and K18 [76]. Interestingly, LNCaP cells are
characterized by low expression of ANXA1 whereas
considerable expression of ANXA1 is reported for PC3
and DU145 cell lines [77].
The role of ANXA1 in cancer progression is still
discussed as this protein may have specific functions in
different tumoral models.
ANXA1 protein is mainly described to be reduced
in PCa [26–31, 78, 79]. Nevertheless, conflicting datasets
exist that suggest ANXA1 over-expression in this tumor
[32–36]. In normal prostate tissue ANXA1 expression
seems to be confined in basal cells and these latter are
extremely rare in PCa mass [80], thus it is likely that the
inconsistent results that were reported may arise from
misunderstanding interpretation on whole biopsies due
to the lacking of a cell-specific identification of ANXA1
expression in the heterogeneity of the tumoral mass.
Interestingly, we have recently reported ANXA1
up-regulation in a ZA-resistant very aggressive sub-line
derived from DU145 PCa cells [9, 10].
In the present study we show in this syngenic
models that ANXA1 is involved in the maintenance
25083

Oncotarget

of some phenotypic features including CSC- and drug
resistance-related ones.
Our results show that in both DU145 and
DU145R80 cells ANXA1 was detectable in cytosol,
membrane and supernatants underlining a whole protein
over-expression in DU145R80 sub-line, in which a strong
cleavage of ANXA1, mainly in extracellular environments
was also observed.
ANXA1 could be exported extracellularly by
the ATP binding cassette A1 (ABC-A1) transporter
system [81, 82] which is highly expressed in androgenindependent PCa cell lines [83]. In this regard we have
shown that DU145R80 cells over-express ABCG2/BCRP
transporter. However, further studies are needed to address
these points.
Analyses of ANXA1 sub-cellular localization
also highlighted an interesting protein enrichment in the
cellular regions involved in cell motility in DU145R80
ZA-resistant sub-line. Comparison between DU145R80
with their parental DU145 cell invasion capability,
by knocking down ANXA1 expression, showed that
the reduction of the protein markedly suppressed the
invasiveness of both PCa cell populations. Since we also
observed ANXA1 appearance in PCa cell supernatants, the
effects of the protein on cell invasion capability could be
arguably carried out in two different ways, as occurs in
other physiological and pathological systems [15, 40].
First, ANXA1 could participate in actin
reorganization by altering cell adhesion and increasing
the formation of cell membrane protrusions through
direct bond with actin [60–62, 24]; second, ANXA1 could
extracellularly bind FPRs which are reported to lead to
cell motility by inducing cytoskeletal reorganization. We
found that DU145 and DU145R80 cells both express
FPR-1 whereas FPR-2 was predominantly detected in
DU145R80.
FPR-2 rather than FPR-1, has been involved in
tumor progression and metastases of several tumors
[84–88]. A variety of agonists in several cell types efficiently
binds FPR-2 and these bonds lead to the activation of
intracellular signaling molecules including STAT3, PLC-γ1/
PKCα and PI3K/Akt pathways [89] and mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK), such as p38MAPK [90, 91] that
interestingly is up-regulated in DU145R80 compared to
DU145 cells [9]. Moreover, FPR-2 is high expressed in
basal rather than in luminal breast cancer cells [86] and
it was very recently implicated in pluripotency associated
gene expression, self-renewal, invasion and tumorigenicity
of CSCs from pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC)
[92] suggesting a crucial role of the receptor in the less
differentiated and therefore more aggressive tumors.
Our observations about the marked FPR-2
expression in the more aggressive DU145R80 sub-line
could be thus in line with those previously reported
observations. Moreover hyper-activation of both STAT3
and ERKs in DU145R80 cells reinforce our hypothesis.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Different expression of FPRs in ZA-sensitive
and ZA-resistant PCa cells was also reflected in the
experiments we performed to analyze the effects of
extracellular ANXA1 on PCa cell invasion capability.
In fact, while the administration of ANXA1 blocking
antibody and fMLP equally affected DU145 and
DU145R80 cell motility by reducing or increasing
invasiveness respectively, Ac2-26 peptide that has higher
affinity for FPR-2 if compared to full length ANXA1 [93],
appeared to be more effective in DU145R80 sub-line.
Accordingly, the FPR-2 selective antagonist WRW4 alone
was able to partially reduce DU145R80 cell invasiveness
whereas had no effect in DU145 cells.
PCa cell ability to maintain some flexibility results
in the aptitude to gain a more aggressive behavior that
is a critical factor for development of CRPCa advanced
disease. In epithelial cancers, this plasticity may involve,
at least in part, the EMT and the reverse process MET.
We have previously reported that, compared to
parental DU145, DU145R80 cells demonstrated resistance
to apoptosis and anoikis, over-expression of anti-apoptotic
and oncogenic proteins, EMT and increased expression of
the metalloproteases 2 and 9 [9].
Since ANXA1 protein has been reported to promote
migration and invasion of metastatic basal-like breast
cancer cells as a modulator for EMT phenotypic switch
through the transforming growth factor (TGF) signaling
pathway [46], our hypothesis was that ANXA1 could
induce the acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype in our
PCa cell models.
As expected, in ANXA1 knockdown conditions
we observed a broad reversion from a EMT to a MET
phenotype, similarly in DU145 and DU145R80 cell
populations. This was characterized by E-cadherin
increase and MMP-2 and -9 reduction. Moreover, ANXA1
decrease led to a marked failure in cytoskeletal and
vimentin organization and a striking reduction of FAK
expression.
Interestingly, a role for ANXA1 was identified
during embryonic development and the proliferationdependent processes of normal versus cancer cell
differentiation [20, 13] although few evidences were
reported about ANXA1 role in SC as well as in CSC
biology [12, 94].
CSCs and metastatic cells share some features, such
as EMT and invasion capability so that CSCs have been
reported as responsible for migration from the site of the
primary tumor and thus starting metastases [95, 96].
Our data showed that DU145R80 sub-population
exhibits an increased capability to undergo basement
membrane invasion and a marked EMT phenotype
compared to DU145 parental PCa cell line.
Several markers are reported to identify prostate
CSCs including CD44, CD133 [97], NANOG [50] and the
stemness-associated gene products Snail, Sox2 and Oct4
[51]. Cells containing all, or some, of these markers are a
25084

Oncotarget

lot more tumorigenic when compared to the complete, non
fractionated tumor cell populations [52, 55, 56].
Notably, we showed that DU145R80 cells have
increased mRNA levels for NANOG, Snail and Oct4, are
CD44high and exhibit gene expression profiles consistent
with those of CD44highCD24low/CD44highCD133high.
CSCs from PCa show resistance to chemotherapy
and radiotherapy [45] therefore, it is likely that the selective
pressure of drugs used during CRPCa treatment also
induces PCa cells to acquire features of CSCs, engendering
treatment resistance. Accordingly, after castration a
recurrent increase of stem cell-like features is observed in
mice and CSC marker expression also increases in basal
PCa cells after androgen deprivation therapy [98].
It has been reported that ANXA1 from prostatederived cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) is capable of
inducing EMT, promoting de novo generation of CSCs and
stimulating the CSC population from PCa cells [94]. Here,
we demonstrate that ANXA1 expression in DU145R80
PCa cells correlates with several genes involved in the
acquisition/maintenance of a CSCs phenotype and/or drug
resistance such as NANOG [50], ALDH1A7 [54], STAT3
[99–102], ERK [61–63], ABCG2 [64] and LRP [65].
The classical mechanism of tumor associated drugresistance mainly includes the expression of various
resistant genes, proteins and enzymes, as well as the
regulation of relevant signal transduction pathways
[103]. A correlation between ANXA1 expression and
drug resistance was observed in different tumors where
the protein seems to act by inducing the drug resistance
behavior in lung adenocarcinoma [104], pancreatic cancer
[105] and ovarian cancer [106] or by reducing it in bladder
cancer [107], hepatoma [108] and myeloid leukemia [109].
In conclusion, on the basis of our findings we suggest
that ANXA1/FPR-2 bond could activate Jak/STAT3
and ERK1/2 pathways and initiate the phosphorylation
of tyrosine residues, translocation of STAT dimer and
activation of transcription [89]. This may cause the upregulation of E-cadherin repressors and alter the polarity
of tumor epithelium. All these pathways may facilitate
the EMT and the status of drug resistance likely leading
to the acquisition/maintenance of CSCs signature to some
extent. Therefore, ANXA1 may be considered as a novel
candidate marker to identify aggressive PCa phenotypes
and/or to represent a novel target for therapy in advanced
disease. Clearly, the temporal and spatial details of changes
in expression of ANXA1 in PCa tumors remain to be clearly
defined and further studies are needed to address this point.

described [9]. DU145 and DU145R80 cells were grown in
RPMI 1640 (Lonza) containing 10% of heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Lonza), 10000 U/ml penicillin
and 10 mg/ml streptomycin (Lonza), 20 mM Hepes (pH
7.4) and 4 mM L-glutamine. The cells were grown in a
humidified atmosphere composed of 95% air and 5% CO2
at 37°C. Suspension culture was performed in Ultra-low
attachment flasks (Corning Incorporated Life Sciences,
Tewksbury, MA, USA).

siRNA transfection
The knockdown of ANXA1 in DU145 and
DU145R80 cells was performed using siRNAs. siRNAs
targeting human ANXA1 were purchased from IDT
(Integrated DNA Technologies Inc., Coralville, IA,
USA). The sequences to target ANXA1 were: sense 5′ATG CCT CAC AGC TAT CGT GAA -3′ and anti-sense
5′- TTC ACG ATA GCT GTG AGG CAT -3′. siRNA
Oligo-Scrambled (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used
as control at the same concentration. PCa cells were
initially plated in media containing 10% FBS. After 24
hours, cells were washed once with PBS and transfected
or not with siRNAs by Nucleofector (Lonza) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were processed
for Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy at 24,
48, 72 and 96 hours after transfection. Invasion assay
experiments were performed at 48 hours from transfection.
siRNA treated cells were harvested at 48 hours from
transfection for RT-PCR analyses.

MTT assay
ZA in sterile H2O (from 1 up to 200 μM) was
administered to PCa cells and IC50 was evaluated
in DU145 and DU145R80 cell lines by MTT assay,
as previously described [110]. Briefly, DU145 and
DU145R80 cells were seeded at 15 × 103 cells/well in a
96-well plate and incubated for the indicated times (48, 72
and 96 hours) at 37°C.
At the ends of the selected experimental times, MTT
stock solution (5 mg/ml) was added to all wells of an assay
(25 μl per 100 μl medium), and plates were incubated at
37°C for 4 hours. At the end of each experimental point,
cells were lysed and the dark blue crystals dissolved
with 100 μl of a solution containing 50% (v/v) N,
N-dimethylformamide, 20% (w/v) SDS with an adjusted pH
of 4.5. The optical density (OD) of each well was measured
with a microplate spectrophotometer (Titertek Multiskan
MCC/340) equipped with a 620 nm filter. The viability of
cells in response to treatment with tested compounds was
calculated as: % viable cells = [OD (550 nm-690 nm) ZA/
OD (550 nm-690 nm) negative control] × 100.
ZA IC50 was determined using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad
Software Inc.). IC50 values were presented as means ± SEM
of at least three independent experiments carried out by
triplicate.

monoclonal a-tubulin (1:5000; Sigma-Aldrich). Membranes
were then incubated at room temperature with an appropriate
secondary rabbit, mouse or goat antibody (1:5000; SigmaAldrich). Immunoreactive protein bands were detected by
chemioluminescence using enhanced chemioluminescence
reagents (ECL; Amersham), the blots were exposed and
analyzed to Las4000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).

DU145 and DU145R80 cells were washed twice
with PBS, detached with trypsin-EDTA 1x in PBS
(Euroclone), harvested in PBS and centrifuged for
5 minutes at 600 × g at 4°C. After that, cells were
lysed in 4 ml of buffer A (Tris HCl 20 mM, pH 7, 4;
sucrose 250 mM; DTT 1 mM; protease inhibitors,
EDTA 1 mM in water), sonicated (5 seconds pulse - 9
seconds pause for 2 minutes, amplitude 42%) and then
centrifuged at 4°C for 10 minutes, at 5000 × g. The
resulting supernatants were ultra-centrifuged for 1 hour
at 100000 × g at 4°C, until to obtain new supernatants
corresponding to cytosol extracts. Each resultant pellet
was dissolved in 4 ml of buffer A and ultra-centrifuged
for 1 hour at 100000 × g at 4°C. The pellets were then
resuspended in 250 μl of buffer B (Tris HCl 20 mM,
pH 7, 4; DTT 1 mM; EDTA 1 mM; Triton X-100 1%,
in water) and left overnight on orbital shaker at 4°C.
Next, the solution was centrifuged for 30 minutes at
50000 × g at 4°C: the supernatants represent membrane
extracts.

Confocal microscopy
After the specific time of incubation, DU145 and
DU145R80 cells were fixed in p-formaldehyde (4% v/v
in PBS) for 5 minutes. The cells were permeabilized
in Triton X-100 (0.5% v/v in PBS) for 5 minutes, and
then incubated in goat or donkey serum (20% v/v PBS)
for 30 minutes, and with primary antibodies against
ANXA1 (rabbit polyclonal; 1:100; Invitrogen), vimentin
(mouse monoclonal; 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
and FAK (mouse monoclonal; 1:100; BD Transduction
Laboratories), overnight at 4°C. After two washing steps
with PBS, cells were incubated with anti-rabbit and
/ or anti-mouse AlexaFluor (488 and/or 555; 1:1000;
Molecular Probes) for 2 hours at RT and then with
FITC-conjugated anti-F-actin (5 μg/ml; PhalloidinFITC, Sigma) for 30 minutes at RT in the dark. Hoechst
33342 (Molecular Probes) was used to detect nuclei.
The coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Mowiol 4–88,
Sigma-Aldrich). A Zeiss LSM 710 Laser Scanning
Microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH) was
used for data acquisition. Images were generated with
Zeiss ZEN Confocal Software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging
GmbH).

Supernatant analysis
Cell growth media were harvested, frozen at −80°C
and lyophilized. Dried samples were suspended in lysis
buffer containing protease inhibitors and left at 4°C for
30 minutes. After centrifugation, the supernatants were
filtered through Amicon Ultra-15, PLTK Ultracel-PL
Membrane, 10 kDa (Millipore).

Western blotting analysis
Protein expression was examined by SDS-PAGE.
Total intracellular proteins were extracted from the cells by
freeze/thawing in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors.
Protein content was estimated according to Biorad protein
assay (BIO-RAD). Samples (20 μg protein) were loaded
onto denaturing-polyacrylamide gel and separated by
SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were then transferred
electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (ImmobilonNC, Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat
dry milk in TBS-Tween 20 (0.1% v/v) and then incubated
overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies. Proteins were
visualized using the enhanced chemioluminescence detection
system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after incubation
overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies as follow: ANXA1

Invasion assay
DU145 and DU145R80 invasion assay was
performed as previously described with minor
modifications [63]. The role of ANXA1 on PCa cell
invasiveness was analyzed in control conditions,
by transfecting the cells with scrambled siRNAs or
siANXA1s, by administration of an ANXA1 blocking
antibody (AbANXA1) or control IgGRs, or by
administration of nFPRs agonists/antagonists. The
analysis of the effects produced on cell invasion was
carried out after 48 h from treatments. Administration of
nFPR agonists/antagonists to PCa cells was performed as
follows: fMLP (50 nM), Ac2-26 (1 μM), Boc-1 (10 μM),
ciclosporin H (CsH; 500 nM), WRW4 (10 μM). The
number of cells that had migrated to the lower surface
was counted in twelve random fields using EVOS light
microscope (10X) (Life technologies Corporation). The
experiments were performed in triplicate.

was assayed in quadruplicate with 20 ng of input RNA per
well in a 25 μl reaction volume containing 1_QuantiTect
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and 1_QuantiTect gene

amplification product was confirmed by examination
of dissociation reaction plots. Cycle threshold values

All gene expression levels were normalized to
GUSB expression. Each sample was tested in triplicate
using RT-PCR and the ABI Prism 7900 HT Sequence
Detection System (Applied Biosystems), and three
independent experiments were used to quantify relative
gene expression.

DU145 and DU145R80 cells were harvested
at a number of 1 × 106 and centrifuged at 30000 × g
for 5 minutes. The pellets were then incubated on
ice for 1 hour in 100 μl of PBS containing a primary
polyclonal antibody against FPR-1 (1:500, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), a primary monoclonal antibody against
FPR-2 (1:100, Genovac), a primary APC-conjugated
antibody against CD44 (2 mg/ml), a primary monoclonal
PE-conjugated antibody against CD24 (2 mg/ml) and a
primary monoclonal PE-conjugated antibody against
CD133 (1 mg/ml) (Miltenyi Biotec, Calderara di Reno,
Bologna, Italy). For FPR-1 and -2 staining DU145 and
DU145R80 cells were next washed twice and incubated on
ice for 1 hour in 100 μl of PBS containing AlexaFluor 488
anti-rabbit (1:1000; Molecular Probes) or Alexa-Fluor 488
anti-mouse (1:1000; Molecular Probes). The cells were
analyzed with Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer
using the Cells Quest program.

Statistical analysis
Representative results from Western blots from a
single experiment are presented; additional experiments
yielded similar results. The optical density of the protein
bands detected by Western blotting was normalized
against tubulin levels. Statistical comparisons between
groups were made using one-way ANOVA or unpaired,
two-tailed t-test comparing two variables. Differences
were considered significant if p < 0.05 and p < 0.01. The
results of invasion assays are expressed as the means for
at least five independent experiments (± S.E.M.). The RTPCR data for mRNA expression are representative of at
least three independent experiments and include the means
± S.E.M. of technical triplicates. Statistical significance
was proved by two-sided Student’s t-tests (normal
distribution), and all statistically significant p-values
(≤0.05) are reported in the manuscript or in figure legends.

Measurement of intracellular Ca2+ signaling
Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations [Ca2+] were mea­
sured using the fluorescent indicator dye Fura 2-AM, the
membrane-permeant acetoxymethyl ester form of Fura
2, as previously described [63], with minor revisions.
Treatment with ionomycin (1 μM, Sigma Aldrich),
fMLP (50 nM, Sigma Aldrich), with Ac2-26 (1 μM,
Tocris Bioscience) or Boc-1 (10 μM, Bachem AG) was
performed by adding the appropriate concentrations of
each substance into the cuvette. The excitation wavelength
was alternated between 340 and 380 nm, and emission
fluorescence was recorded at 515 nm. The ratio of
fluorescence intensity of 340/380 nm (F340/F380) was
used to estimate intracellular free calcium. Results are
indicated as delta increase of fluorescence ratio (F340/
F380 nm) induced by ionomycin-basal fluorescence ratio
(F340/F380 nm).
