ABSTRACT
Fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (CT) has been the mainstay of care of
metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) for years. Response rates are only observed,
however, in about half of treated patients, and there are no reliable tools to
prospectively identify patients more likely to benefit from therapy. The purpose of
our study was to identify a gene expression profile predictive of CT response in mCRC.
Whole genome expression analyses (Affymetrix GeneChip® HG-U133 Plus 2.0) were
performed in fresh frozen tumor samples of 37 mCRC patients (training cohort).
Differential gene expression profiles among the two study conditions (responders
versus non-responders) were assessed using supervised class prediction algorithms.
A set of 161 differentially expressed genes in responders (23 patients; 62%) versus
non-responders (14 patients; 38%) was selected for further assessment and validation
by RT-qPCR (TaqMan®Low Density Arrays (TLDA) 7900 HT Micro Fluidic Cards) in an
independent multi-institutional cohort (53 mCRC patients). Seven of these genes
were confirmed as significant predictors of response. Patients with a favorable
predictive signature had significantly greater response rate (58% vs 13%, p = 0.024),
progression-free survival (61% vs 13% at 1 year, HR = 0.32, p = 0.009) and overall
survival (32 vs 16 months, HR = 0.21, p = 0.003) than patients with an unfavorable
gene signature. This is the first study to validate a gene-expression profile predictive
of response to CT in mCRC patients. Larger and prospective confirmatory studies are
required, however, in order to successfully provide oncologists with adequate tools
to optimize treatment selection in routine clinical practice.

incurable. Several combination regimens including
fluoropyrimidines and oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan, with
or without monoclonal antibodies targeting VEGF or
EGFR, remain the mainstay of care in metastatic CRC
(mCRC). Response rates, however, are observed in only
40–60% of the patients and median survival does not
generally exceed 24 months [2, 3, 4]. As treatment options
expand, the development of reliable tools to discriminate

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
tumor in the world and is responsible for 8% of cancer
related deaths [1]. Although prognosis has greatly
improved over the past decades due to significant surgical
and medical advances, once the tumor has progressed
beyond surgical resectability the disease is essentially

patients likely to benefit from specific therapies remains
a major clinical challenge. Indeed, with the exception
of RAS mutations as predictors of resistance to EGFRtargeted therapy, no validated biomarker to date has
been able to assist clinicians in the selection of the most
appropriate treatment regimen for a specific patient [5, 6].
Gene expression profiling has demonstrated great
potential in cancer research, improving diagnostic,
prognostic and predictive precision in several tumor
types [7], including CRC [8]. Over the last two decades,
different studies have proved that gene expression
profiles are able to discriminate normal colonic tissue
from benign adenomas and adenocarcinomas in different
stages of tumor progression [9], or to stratify the risk of
developing CRC of normal colonic tissue [10]. More
recently, different gene signatures developed in early-stage
CRC have shown to predict the risk of relapse in these
patients [11–14], and some of them have demonstrated
improved prognosis accuracy over conventional clinical
and pathological features [15]. By contrast, however, the
value of this technology to predict response to therapy
has not been deeply investigated. Although a number of
studies have successfully identified gene signatures able
to predict sensitivity to different agents in CRC cell lines
[16, 17], studies assessing the potential predictive role
of gene profiling in patients with advanced disease are
scarce [18–20]. Therefore, larger and validation studies
are needed to generate reliable data capable to make the
desirable transition to the clinic.
Our aim in this project was to generate a gene profile
predictor of response to chemotherapy in patients with
mCRC treated with fluoropyrimidine-based regimens.
Whole genome expression analyses were performed
in tumor samples of mCRC patients and differentially
expressed genes were then validated by RT-qPCR in an
independent cohort of mCRC patients.

as the primary outcome measure, a set of 161 genes were
selected for further validation by RT-qPCR based on the
greater magnitude of their fold-change values, the degree
of concordance for both outcome measures (objective
response and PFS), and their biological relevance in CRC.
A detailed list of the 161 selected genes is depicted in
supplementary Table S3.

RESULTS

Biological and molecular function of validated
predictive genes

Validation of the gene signature predictive of
response to chemotherapy in mCRC patients
Selected genes were assessed by Taqman-based
RT-qPCR in tumor samples of the validation multiinstitutional cohort of mCRC patients. As depicted in
Table 1, 7 of these genes were validated to be differentially
expressed among patients that achieved an objective
response to chemotherapy (R: CR + PR) versus those that
did not (NR: SD + PD) using the Statminer® software v.4.2
(adjusted p values < 0.05): DCK, DNAJC3, NAV1, NIPBL,
PALM2, VSNL1 and WSHC1L1.

Risk score according to the 7-gene signature
Following independent validation of the 7 genes, a
risk score was developed to classify each patient as high
score or favorable predictive signature, if they had favorable
gene expression levels in at least 4 of the 7 genes in the
signature, or low score or unfavorable predictive signature,
if they had favorable gene expression levels in ≤ 3 of the 7
genes in the signature. Patients with a favorable predictive
signature had a significantly greater response rate (58% vs
13%, p = 0.024) and PFS (61% vs 13% at 1 year, HR =
0.32, p = 0.009) than patients with an unfavorable predictive
signature. Overall survival was also significantly longer for
patients with high versus low score signatures (32 vs 16
months, HR = 0.21, p = 0.003). Figure 2 illustrates PFS and
OS of patients according to the 7-gene score.

Gene expression profile development (training
cohort)

According to the GeneOntology [21] classification,
these genes are involved in the following biological functions
or molecular pathways: control of cell shape or adhesion
(PALM2), transcription regulation (WSHC1L1), stem cell
maintenance (NIPBL), chaperone binding (DNAJC3),
nucleotide and folic acid metabolism (DCK), microtubule
bindle formation (NAV1), and ion transport and binding
(VSNL1). Detailed description of genes and the functional
classes to which they belong is outlined in Table 2.

Whole human genome expression profiles were
assessed in tumor samples of patients in the training cohort
(N = 37) using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 chips. All of the
samples provided adequate RNA for microarray analysis.
Supervised analysis identified 595 differentially expressed
genes ( p < 0.05) in responders (23 patients; 62%) versus
non-responders (14 patients; 38%) (Figure 1A). In
addition, when supervised analyses were performed with
PFS as a surrogate marker for response (Figure 1B),
318 genes were identified to be differentially expressed
in patients with long (> median PFS) versus short
(≤ median PFS) PFS values. Among the top 250 genes
with greater statistical significance (lower P values) in
cluster analyses using objective response to chemotherapy

synthase, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase or thymidine
phosphorylase for 5FU, topoisomerase I for irinotecan,
or excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1) for
oxaliplatin. However, none of these putative markers have
been implemented in clinical practice due to their poor
prediction accuracy and also to the lack of reproducibility
across different studies and patient populations. These
discrepancies are not unexpected, as sensitivity to treatment
is a complex issue dependent on many individual and tumor
factors, that ultimately determine, among other critical
issues, drug disposition and pharmacodynamic effects on
normal and malignant cells, as well as cell response to
drug damage. The common use of multiple-drug regimens
further complicates this scenario. In this context, multiplegene signatures are likely to improve prediction accuracy
over single marker genes [8, 15, 16]. However, and in spite
of the undeniable success of several microarray-based
prognostic gene signatures, currently being validated in
prospective clinical trials [22–26] (i.e. Mammaprint and
Oncotype DX in breast cancer, or Coloprint in CRC),
predictive genomics remain a challenge.
Our study validated several predictive genes
implicated in key cellular pathways and also some genes
with molecular functions potentially related to chemotherapy
response. Deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) is required for the
phosphorylation of several deoxyribonucleosides and their

nucleoside analogs, which are widely used as antiviral and
anticancer agents (i.e. cytarabine, gemcitabine). Increased
DCK activity is associated with increased activation of these
compounds to cytotoxic nucleoside triphosphate derivatives,
and DCK deficiency correlated with resistance to these
agents in a panel of hematologic and solid cell lines in vitro,
and also in some human tumors [27]. VSNL1 is a member
of the visinin/recoverin subfamily of neuronal calcium
sensor proteins, mainly expressed in the central nervous
system, that modulate intracellular signaling pathways
by regulating the activity of adenyl cyclase. Upregulation
of VSNL1 potentiated the anoikis-resistant ability of
neuroblastoma tumor cells and enhanced neuroblastoma
cell invasiveness and metastasis [28]. Some authors have
also suggested VSNL1 may play an important role in
the invasive phenotype of CRC, and may also influence
sensitivity to cytotoxic agents active in this disease, such
as campthotecins [29]. Indeed, VSNL1 overexpression
was associated with a higher risk of lymphatic invasion
and a poorer prognosis in a series of patients with early
stage CRC [30], and downregulation of this gene was
observed in camptothecin-resistant gastric cancer cell lines
[29]. Finally, PALM2 has been reported to be upregulated
in responder CRC tumors to MS-275, a selective histone
deacetylase inhibitor that disturbs cell adhesion, response
to extracellular stimuli and transcription cellular processes

[31]. However, the function of the putative protein product
of PALM2-AKAP2, a naturally occurring cotranscribed
mRNA, remains to be elucidated.
While gene expression profiling has been widely
applied to CRC for diagnosis, classification and prognosis,
studies evaluating its potential role to predict response to
medical therapy are still scarce. Indeed, most available
data to date derive from preclinical studies. Mariadason
and colleagues demonstrated the ability of gene profiling
to predict 5FU- and irinotecan-induced apoptosis in a panel
of 30 CRC cell lines [16], and, importantly, they showed
how this approach predicted response more accurately than
4 previously established determinants of 5FU response:
thymidylate synthase, thymidine phosphorylase, mismatch
repair status and p53 mutation [16]. Other investigators
have also reported gene signatures predictive of 5FU or
oxaliplatin sensitivity in vitro [17]. However, very few
studies have assessed the predictive role of gene profiling
in the clinical setting (i.e. patients with advanced CRC)
[18, 19]. Del Rio et al identified 14 genes predictive of
response to FOLFIRI (5-FU, leucovorin and irinotecan) in
a series of 21 patients with mCRC [18], whereas Watanabe
et al reported a 27-gene prediction model of response
to FOLFOX (5-FU, leucovorin and oxaliplatin) in 40
mCRC patients [19]. Of note, none of these small studies
attempted to validate the observed results by alternative
techniques or in independent patient cohorts. In our study,
by contrast, genes identified by whole genome expression
analyses to predict response to chemotherapy were further
assessed by RT-qPCR in an independent multi-institutional
validation cohort. Although direct comparison of genes
from predictive signatures reported by Del Rio, Watanabe
and our group shows no overlap, common signaling
networks were identified to play a relevant role in this
context according to the Gene Ontology classification,
including cell growth and proliferation, angiogenesis,
cell adhesion, immune response and ion/protein transport
and binding. A number of reasons may partially explain
the lack of consistent results across studies, including
heterogeneity in patient characteristics and treatment
regimens, study design (prospective versus retrospective),
source of predictive tissue, tissue collection procedures,
platform used, and statistical and analytical methods. The
lack of a control population and of independent validation
in a larger cohort of patients is also a major pending issue
before this promising tool may be used by oncologists to
tailor patient treatment. Our group is currently undergoing
a prospective study to validate these findings in paraffinembedded tissue.
In conclusion, our study identified a 7-gene profile
predictive of response to fluoropyrimidine-based chemo­
therapy in mCRC. This is to our knowledge the first
validated predictive profile in advanced colorectal cancer
patients. Functional classification of these genes revealed
their implication in key pathways of CRC biology, as
well as in molecular processes potentially linked to drug

sensitivity. As treatment options in CRC continue to expand,
the development of predictive signatures shall become
invaluable tools to assist clinicians to appropriately select the
most effective therapy in each patient and also in providing
new clues regarding key molecular pathways involved in
drug response. Larger and prospective confirmatory studies
are required, however, in order to successfully implement
predictive gene-signatures in clinical practice.

METHODS
Patients and tumor samples
From 2008 to 2010, patients that met the following
inclusion criteria were selected for the present study:
1) histologically confirmed diagnosis of primary CRC;
2) TNM stage IV [32]; 3) treatment with at least one
fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen for
advanced disease; 4) evaluable for response according
to RECIST criteria [33]; 5) adequate tissue specimen
available for molecular assays (snap-frozen at –80°C
with a proportion of tumor cells > 50%). Follow-up was
performed in all centers as per ESMO guidelines [34],
including a CT scan for response assessment every 8 to
12 weeks in the absence of clinical deterioration or any
other clinical suspicion of disease progression. The study
protocol was approved by the institutional review boards
of participating centers and written consent was provided
by all included patients.
Whole genome expression analysis was performed
in a training cohort of CRC samples (N = 37) collected at
the Hospital Marqués de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain. The
gene profile was validated by RT-qPCR in an independent
multi-institutional cohort that included 53 tumor samples
collected at three Spanish hospitals (Hospital Virgen del
Rocio (Seville), Hospital Virgen de la Victoria (Malaga)
and Hospital de la Merced (Osuna)). Main characteristics
of the study population are summarized in supplementary
Tables S1 and S2, and are representative of a standard
metastatic CRC population. Distribution of clinical and
pathological features in the training and validation cohorts
did not differ significantly.

RNA isolation and processing
All tissue samples were preserved at –80°C until
RNA extraction and processing. Sample homogenization
was achieved using QIAshredder homogenizers and total
RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (both kits from
Qiagen Inc; Valencia, CA, USA).

Microarray gene expression assays
Microarray gene expression assays were performed
for each of the 37 samples using Human Whole Genome
U133 Plus 2.0 array (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara,
CA) based on manufacturer’s instructions. Following

chemotherapy for mCRC). As a surrogate marker of
chemotherapy response, supervised analysis were also
performed to assess differential expression among patients
with long versus short progression-free survival (above
versus below the median, respectively).
qRT-PCR analysis
Cycle threshold (Ct) values were calculated using the
SDS software v.2.3 (Applied Biosystems) using automatic
baseline settings and a threshold of 0.2. GAPDH was used
as endogenous control. Data are presented as target gene
expression = 2-ΔCt, with ΔCt = (target gene Ct-GAPDH Ct).
Gene expression was computed by real-time Statminer®
software v.4.2 (Intergromics, Inc), using the BenjaminiHochberg algorithm [35] with the FDR set at a value of
5%. Gene expression had to be detected in at least 50% of
samples in each study group in order to be considered for
analysis. PCR GEO accession number GSE52513.

Clinical variables
Descriptive statistics were used to characterize
the most relevant clinical parameters. The association of
categorical variables was explored by the chi-squared test
or Fisher’s exact test. To assess distribution of continuous
variables among study groups, parametric (t-test) or
non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney
tests) were used when appropriate. Tumor response was
evaluated according to the standard RECIST 1.0 criteria
[33] to categorize patients as responders ([R]: complete
response [CR] + partial response [PR]) or non-responders
([NR]: stable disease [SD] + progression disease [PD]).
Progression Free Survival (PFS) was defined as the time
elapsed from the date of initiation of first-line chemotherapy
to the date of the first documented evidence of disease
progression. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the
start of therapy for advanced disease to the date of death
from any cause. Survival curves were estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method, and survival differences among
groups were assessed by the log-rank test. p < 0.05 was
considered significant. All analyses were performed using
the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software
(SPSS 18.0 for Windows; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
