Abstract
Obesity is associated with increased cancer incidence and
mortality. We have previously found that obesity in children is
associated with a 50% increased recurrence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in high-risk patients. We have therefore
developed novel in vivo and in vitro preclinical models to
study the mechanism(s) of this association. Obesity increased
relapse after monotherapy with vincristine (P = 0.03) in obese
mice injected with syngeneic ALL cells. This occurred although
the drug was dosed proportionally to body weight, equalizing
blood and tissue drug levels. In coculture, 3T3-L1 adipocytes
significantly impaired the antileukemia efficacy of vincristine,
as well as three other chemotherapies (P < 0.05). Interestingly, this protection was independent of cell-cell contact,
and it extended to human leukemia cell lines as well.
Adipocytes prevented chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, and
this was associated with increased expression of the two
prosurvival signals Bcl-2 and Pim-2. These findings highlight
the role of the adipocyte in fostering leukemia chemotherapy
resistance, and may help explain the increased leukemia
relapse rate in obese children and adults. Given the growing
prevalence of obesity worldwide, these effects are likely to
have increasing importance to cancer treatment. [Cancer Res
2009;69(19):7867–74]

Introduction
Obesity is associated with an increased risk of numerous types of
cancer in adults (1–7). In addition, obese cancer patients have
poorer outcomes than their leaner counterparts (7–9). Calle and
colleagues (1) estimated that given the high prevalence of obesity
in the United States and the strength of its association with cancer,
14% of all cancer deaths in men and 20% in women are attributable
to obesity.
Leukemia is the most common childhood cancer, affecting
f2,000 children per year in the United States (10). We have
previously shown that obese adults diagnosed with acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have a 50% higher likelihood of
relapse than lean adults (11). Three recent studies have examined
the relationships between obesity and ALL relapse in children. Two
of these reported that obesity tended to increase (12) or had no
detectable effect on relapse risk (13). However, these relatively
small studies each had fewer than 25 obese subjects ages over 10

years. In a large cohort of 5,420 children, including 262 obese
subjects ages z10 years, we found that obesity at the time of ALL
diagnosis independently increased relapse rates by f50% in
children z10 years of age (14).
The mechanisms underlying the association between obesity and
ALL relapse are likely multifactorial. Adipocytes could alter
chemotherapy pharmacokinetics and/or induce drug resistance
by secretion of adipokines. Other growth factors secreted in the
context of obesity could enhance leukemia cell survival. Adipose
tissue stromal cells promote solid tumor growth, and thus might
affect leukemia cells as well (15). To investigate the roles of obesity
in ALL relapse, we have established new in vivo and in vitro models.
We focused our studies on vincristine, as it is used nearly universally as a
first-line agent in the treatment of childhood leukemia, and vincristine
resistance in vitro (16) and in mouse xenografts (17) is strongly
prognostic of relapse. Here, we report how adipocytes impair the
leukemia response to vincristine in vivo and of several drugs in vitro.

Materials and Methods
Diet-induced obesity model. Male C57Bl/6 mice (The Jackson
Laboratory) were weaned onto a high-fat diet (60% of calories from fat;
Research Diets D12492) or a control diet (10% of calories from fat, D12450)
until transplantations at f20 wk of age. All experiments were approved by
the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee and performed in accordance with the USPHS Policy on
Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Cell lines. Murine pre–B-cell ALL was previously isolated from a BCR/
ABL transgenic mouse (‘‘8093 cells’’; refs. 18, 19). A subset of these was
transduced on retronectin-coated plates with a retroviral vector containing
pMIG_GFP (provided by M. Müschen of Children’s Hospital Los Angeles,
Los Angeles, CA). Human leukemia cell lines included RCH-ACV (pre–B ALL
with an E2A-PBX1 fusion protein; ref. 20), BV173 (Pre B Ph+ ALL; ref. 21), SD-1
(pre-B Ph+ ALL, DSMZ), and RS4;11 [pre-B t(4;11) ALL, American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC)].
Murine fibroblasts and adipocytes were derived from 3T3-L1 cells
(ATCC). 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into adipocytes based on
optimization of a method previously described (22). Briefly, cells were
grown to confluence in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), Glutamax, sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics in poly-D-lysine coated
wells (day 2). On day 0, the media were changed to DMEM with
supplements plus 15% FBS, 20 mmol/L HEPES, 150 nmol/L insulin, 250
nmol/L dexamethasone, and 0.5 mmol/L isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma).
On day +2, dexamethasone and isobutylmethylxanthine were removed from
the media, and on day +4, insulin was removed. Media changes were
performed every 2 d until use. Adipocytes were used for coculture
experiments between days +7 and +14. Undifferentiated 3T3-L1 fibroblasts
were irradiated and then plated at confluence. Control experiments were
also performed with nonirradiated 3T3-L1 cells at confluence. In different
experiments, we used adipocytes differentiated from OP-9 murine bone
marrow mesenchymal cells (ATCC) as described above (23), and
undifferentiated (nonirradiated) OP-9 cells as control.

In vivo leukemia model. To test whether obesity would impact
proliferation of leukemia in vivo, we injected 5,000 8093 cells into mice via a
retro-orbital route. Animals were euthanized upon development of
progressive leukemia (weight loss of >10%, paralysis, hunched posture, or
visible masses of >1 cm). Leukemia was verified by necropsy and/or by DNA
qPCR for BCR/ABL in peripheral blood, using DNeasy kits (Qiagen) and
Power SYBR Green master mix on an ABI Prism 7722 Sequence Detector
(Applied Biosystems).
To examine the effects of diet-induced obesity (DIO) on leukemia
treatment, we injected 10,000 8093 cells into 12 DIO, 12 control, and 7
vehicle mice as above. Eight days after the injection, mice were treated with
vincristine in proportion to body weight (0.5 mg/kg/wk via i.p. injection 4
wk, Vincasar, Teva Pharmaceuticals; ref. 24).
Five additional DIO mice were transplanted with GFP+ 8093 cells and
treated for 3 to 4 wk with vincristine after an 8- to 10-d engraftment period.
Mice were perfused with paraformaldehyde (PFA; n = 2) or PBS (n = 3) at
time of leukemia relapse and sacrifice. Fat pads from the PFA-perfused mice
were removed, cut into small (f1 mm) pieces, and examined en bloc for
the presence of GFP+ leukemia cells. Fat pads from the PBS-perfused mice
were fixed in PFA, frozen in optimum cutting temperature (Sakura TissueTek), and sliced to 10-Am-thickness (at 20jC). Additional fat pads were
digested with Liberase TM (Roche) at 2 U/mL for 30 min, spun at 350 g 
5 min, washed, and pelleted cells were cultured for 3 to 5 d to test for
viability and vincristine sensitivity.
Coculture experiments. Leukemia cells were seeded into 24-well plates
with fibroblasts, adipocytes, or no feeder layer. In experiments of drug
resistance, 5 nmol/L vincristine, 20 nmol/L nilotinib, 35 nmol/L daunorubicin, or 25 nmol/L dexamethasone was added (all at the IC90 in our culture
system without feeder layers). After 72 h, the wells were triturated forcefully
to remove cells within and below the feeder layers, and counted by a
blinded observer by trypan blue exclusion.
The importance of cell-cell contact was assessed with 8093 leukemia cells
in the upper chambers of polycarbonate 0.4-Am pore size TransWells
(Corning, Inc.,). TransWell experiments were repeated with BV-173, SD1,
RS4;11, and RCH ACV human leukemia cell lines. To assess the importance
of adipocyte viability, feeder layers were fixed with PFA before being used in
TransWells. Layers were exposed to 4% PFA for 1 to 12 h, and then rinsed
thrice with PBS followed by RPMI overnight. All experiments were done in
triplicate and at least thrice unless otherwise noted.
Cell cycle and RNA expression studies. 8093 cells cultured in
TransWells as above were analyzed for cell cycle and apoptosis by
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation (BrdU flow kit, BD Biosciences),
and cells were analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences, CellQuest software).
Lymphocytes were defined based on forward and side scatter, and the
percentage of this gated population in each cell cycle phase was
determined. To assess gene expression, cells from a single TransWell
experiment performed in triplicate were harvested and resuspended in
RNAProtect (Qiagen), and RNA were extracted and purified with RNEasy
Mini kits (Qiagen). RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA with High
Capacity 1st Strand Synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems). cDNA was
combined with a SYBR Green master mix and applied to an Apoptosis
PCR Array RT2 Profiler (SABiosciences). The cycling program was based on
the manufacturer’s instructions.
The expression of selected genes was confirmed with rtPCR on five
biological replicates, each in triplicate, using 25 ng of cDNA, Power SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 200 nmol/L primers
generated using National Center for Biotechnology Information
Primer-BLAST. Murine h-actin was amplified using MBACTU (5¶-TCATGAAGTGTGACGTTGACATCCGT-3¶) and MBACTD (5¶-CCTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACGATG-3¶), which yielded a product of 285 bp. Murine
Pim 2 was amplified using MPIM2U (5¶-AGCACCTCCTCCATGTTGAC-3¶)
and MPIM2D (5¶-GATGGCCACCTGACGTCTAT-3¶), which yielded a product
of 192 bp. Murine Bcl-2 was amplified using MBCL2U (5¶-GCAGGTGCCTACAAGAAAGC-3¶) and MBCL2D (5¶-GCATTTTCCCACCACTGTCT-3¶), which
yielded a product of 162 bp. Gene expression levels were quantified using
the ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System with the following thermal
profile: 10 min at 95.0 followed by 40 repeats of 95.0, 15 s and 60.0, 1 min,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

and a final dissociation stage of 95.0 for 15 s, 60.0 for 15 s, and 95.0 for 15 s.
Transcript levels were normalized to h-actin.
Western blots. 8093 cells were cultured in TransWells and collected
24 h after exposure to no drug or 5 nmol/L vincristine. Cells were washed in
ice cold PBS and lysed in SSB buffer [62.5 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 2% w/v SDS, 1%
v/v Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), 10% glycerol, 0.01 mg/mL aprotinin, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride, and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail Set II
(Calbiochem)] by sonication. Protein concentration was measured via the
BCA method (Pierce), bromophenol blue, and NuPage Reducing Agent
(Invitrogen) were added to the lysate, and the resulting mixture was heated.
Equal amounts of total protein were run on a 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel
and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). The membranes
were blocked in TBST (1 TBS and 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat dry milk
and incubated with the antibodies to Pim-2 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-28778), phospho-Bad (1:1,000; Ser112, Cell Signaling Technology),
Bad (1:1,000; Cell Signaling Technology), and h-actin (1:2,000; Cell Signaling
Technology), and then washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibodies. The membranes were developed using
enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).
Calculations and statistics. Body weights were compared with
unpaired t tests. Survival curves were generated by Kaplan Meier Life
Tables. Due to the low number of animals in the transplantation
experiments, P values for the difference in survival were calculated from
a permutation distribution of the log-rank test with 10,000 replicates, using
SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc.). Each coculture experiment was
performed on different days or using different cell thaws, and the averages
of three triplicate wells for each condition were calculated. Paired t tests
were used to compare number of viable leukemia cells over the various
feeder layers. One-sided P values were used to test the a priori hypotheses
that obese animals would have increased relapse rates compared with lean
animals, and adipocytes would protect leukemia cells from chemotherapies.

Results
Modeling leukemia in obese mice. Male C57Bl/6 mice were
made obese (DIO) by a high-fat diet (25) and used as recipients of
syngeneic 8093 BCR/ABL + leukemia cells, to test for effects of
obesity on leukemia development and treatment outcome. At the
time of transplantation, the DIO mice were significantly heavier
than control mice (39.5 F 4.7 versus 30.6 F 4.9 grams; P < 0.0001).
In our initial experiment, 16 DIO and 16 control mice were
transplanted with 5,000 leukemia cells and observed until
progressive leukemia developed (weight loss of >10%, paralysis,
hunched posture, or visible masses of >1 cm); we found that obesity
did not affect the time to development of progressive leukemia
(21.5 versus 22.0 days; P = 0.22; Fig. 1A). Next, animals were
transplanted with 10,000 leukemia cells and treated with 0.5 mg/
kg/week of vincristine or vehicle. Independently from obesity, mice
treated with vincristine survived longer than vehicle-treated mice
(P < 0.0001; Fig. 1B). Interestingly, obesity impaired the effect of
vincristine: progressive leukemia developed in 7 of 12 DIO mice
treated with vincristine, but in only 3 of 12 control mice (P = 0.03).
Indeed, one DIO mouse even developed progressive leukemia
before receiving the final dose of vincristine.
To address whether obesity impaired leukemia treatment via an
interaction between adipocytes and leukemia cells, we next
investigated whether adipose tissue could act as a ‘‘sanctuary’’ for
leukemia cells during or after chemotherapy. Five obese mice were
injected with GFP+ ALL cells and then treated with vincristine.
Animals were sacrificed when signs of leukemia developed, which
occurred during the vincristine treatment period in three of the five
mice. Numerous GFP+ leukemia cells were visible in fat pads from
all mice (Fig. 1C). These cells remained viable and proliferated in
culture, and after 3 to 5 days, <10% were apoptotic, as measured by

Annexin V and 7-AAD (n = 3; Supplementary Fig. S1). These cells
also retained their sensitivity to 5 nmol/L vincristine (n = 3; data
not shown). These findings support the concept that adipose tissue
can be a sanctuary site for leukemia during vincristine treatment.
Blood and tissue vincristine concentration. To exclude the
possibility that altered vincristine pharmacokinetics in obese mice
confounded our survival results, we measured blood and tissue
concentrations of vincristine after a 0.5 mg/kg vincristine injection
in groups of DIO and control mice (see Supplementary Materials
and Methods). As discussed, vincristine was given at doses
proportional to body weight, so obese mice on average received
f28% more vincristine in total than control mice (19.7 F 2.2
versus 14.7 F 0.8 Ag/mouse). However, vincristine profiles in blood
and tissues were very similar between groups (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Thus, poorer survival in obese mice was not likely due
to altered exposure to the drug after dosage adjustment using
body weight.
Adipocytes protect leukemia cells against drug treatment.
To further characterize the possible effects of adipocytes on
vincristine-induced cytotoxicity of leukemia cells, we developed an
in vitro coculture system. Murine embryonic fibroblasts have been
shown to provide significant protection to leukemia cells against
some drugs (26, 27). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were differentiated into
adipocytes by exposure to a mixture of insulin, dexamethasone,
and isobutylmethylxanthine (see Materials and Methods), and
cultured together with 8093 leukemia cells. Irradiated, undifferen-

tiated 3T3-L1 cells, which have a fibroblast phenotype, were used as
controls.
The differentiated 3T3-L1 cells accumulated large lipid droplets
as has been previously described (22). Leukemia cells rapidly
(within 72 hours) migrated into and beneath the adipocyte layer
(Fig. 1D), similar to what we had previously observed with murine
embryonic fibroblasts. The proliferation of 8093 cells in coculture
tended to be less with either 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (P = 0.27) or
adipocytes (P = 0.09) after 3 days than without feeder layer, perhaps
due to depletion of nutrients from the media (data not shown).
However, coculture with adipocytes significantly decreased vincristine cytotoxicity toward leukemia. After 72 hours of vincristine
exposure, the mean number of viable ALL cells was higher in
cultures with adipocytes (52.8 F 16.0  103) than with fibroblasts
(21.4 F 7.0  103; P = 0.048) or no feeder (8.5 F 1.5  103; P = 0.054;
Fig. 2A, top). Similar coculture experiments were performed with
three other antileukemia agents, each with different modes of
antitumor activity (dexamethasone, daunorubicin, or nilotinib;
Fig. 2A, top and bottom). For each drug, there were more surviving
leukemia cells in coculture with adipocytes than with fibroblasts or
no feeder.
Protection of leukemia cells does not depend on cell-cell
contact, but requires living adipocytes. Because the leukemia
cells established a close physical interaction with the feeder layers
in coculture, we next investigated whether direct contact between
adipocytes and leukemia cells is necessary for protection.

Figure 2. Coculture with 3T3-L1 adipocytes provides significant protection against drug treatment to 8093 leukemia cells. A, number of viable leukemia cells
after 72 h of exposure to vincristine (5 nmol/L), nilotinib (20 nmol/L), daunorubicin (35 nmol/L), or dexamethasone (25 nmol/L) while in coculture with 3T3-L1 fibroblasts
(hatched columns ) or adipocytes (black columns ), compared with culture alone (gray columns ). B, proliferation of 8093 cells in TransWells over no feeder (dotted

cells during exposure to 5 nmol/L vincristine while in TransWells over adipocytes (solid line ), fibroblasts (black dashed line ), or no feeder layer (gray dotted line ;
n = 5 experiments done in triplicate); *, P < 0.05; ***, P < 0.005 adipocyte versus fibroblast feeder layer, paired t test.

Leukemia cells were cocultured in TransWells over the feeder
layers, so that the two cell types were separated by a porous
membrane that prevents physical contact. The feeder layers did not
influence the leukemia proliferation rate in TransWells (Fig. 2B; P =
not significant for all comparisons). However, adipocytes in the
lower chamber provided significant protection against vincristine
(Fig. 2C). In fact, 5 nmol/L vincristine suppressed viable leukemia
cells over adipocytes by only 11 F 9% from the initial plated value,
whereas those over fibroblasts or no feeder were much more
significantly suppressed (by 55 F 3%, and 85 F 2%, P = 0.009 and
P = 0.001 versus adipocytes, respectively).
To confirm that these coculture results are relevant to human
leukemia, and not particular to the culture models used, we
performed several additional experiments. To ensure that irradiation of the fibroblast feeder layers was not responsible for the lack
of protection compared with adipocytes, we performed TransWell
experiments with nonirradiated, senescent 3T3-L1 fibroblasts.
These fibroblasts offered similar protection to leukemia cells
against vincristine as the irradiated layers (data not shown). We
also found that 3T3-L1 adipocytes caused resistance to vincristine
in three of four human leukemia cell lines tested (Fig. 3A). Finally,
OP-9 cells, which are murine bone marrow–derived mesenchymal
cells that can be differentiated into adipocytes, also protected 8093
cells against vincristine, although to a lesser degree than 3T3-L1
adipocytes (Fig. 3B).
To verify that living adipocytes are needed to provide protection
to the leukemia cells, we also tested vincristine-induced cytotoxicity in TransWell cultures, in which the feeder layers had been
fixed with PFA. The presence of fixed adipocytes or fibroblasts

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

in TransWell coculture did not alter leukemia proliferation rates
(Fig. 3C). However, neither fixed fibroblasts nor fixed adipocytes
protected 8093 leukemia cells against vincristine treatment
(Fig. 3D).
Mechanisms of adipocyte-induced vincristine resistance. We
considered the possibility that adipocytes might protect leukemia
by sequestering the lipophilic vincristine, decreasing its availability.
To examine this, vincristine levels were measured in fibroblasts and
adipocytes after 48 hours of drug exposure (see Supplementary
Materials and Methods). We found that adipocytes in TransWells
did accumulate significantly more vincristine than fibroblasts
(1.28 F 0.28 versus 0.49 F 0.12 nmol/L vincristine, P = 0.002;
Supplementary Fig. S3A). The accumulation of drug into these
monolayers of cells, however, was not reflected by a detectible
decrease in the concentration of vincristine in the media
(Supplementary Fig. S3B) or leukemia cells (data not shown).
To further explore how adipocytes protect leukemia cells, we
assessed the leukemia cell cycle and apoptotic status in our
coculture system. 8093 cells were exposed to bromodeoxyuridine
while in TransWells over the various feeder layers, and their cell
cycle state assessed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis. Neither feeder layer altered the cell cycle kinetics under
baseline conditions (Table 1). Addition of vincristine decreased the
proportion of cells in S phase and increased the proportion of cells
undergoing apoptosis. Compared with leukemia cells over no
feeder (Fig. 4A) or fibroblasts (Fig. 4B), adipocytes partially
reversed the effects of vincristine, by decreasing apoptosis and
increasing the proportion of cells in G0-G1 and S phase during
vincristine exposure (Table 1; Fig. 4C).

Adipocytes up-regulated Bcl-2 and Pim-2 expression, both with and
without vincristine, and these results were verified by rtPCR
(Fig. 5A). Overall Pim-2 protein level was up-regulated by
adipocytes, particularly in the presence of vincristine (Supplementary Fig. S4; Fig. 5B). Because Pim-2 prevents apoptosis via

inactivation of Bad, we assessed Bad phosphorylation, and found
that adipocytes increased the level of phosphorylated Bad in 8093
leukemia cells. Thus, adipocyte protection of leukemia cells from
vincristine was associated with up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Pim-2,
and an increased phosphorylation of Bad.

Discussion
Elucidating the mechanism(s) linking obesity and leukemia
relapse is complicated by the large number of effects of obesity, and
the long list of potential factors that could lead to relapse.
Therefore, we have developed cell culture and animal models of
obesity and leukemia to explore this relationship. In our mouse
model, we have recapitulated the increased ALL relapse observed
in obese patients—obese mice injected with highly malignant pre–
B lymphoblastic leukemia cells had a worse treatment outcome.
Interestingly, we found leukemia cells associated with fat pads in
vincristine-treated mice, suggesting that adipose tissue may be
partly responsible for the effect of obesity to increase leukemia
relapse. Although the fat depots were examined only once the mice
developed progressive leukemia, three of the five mice developed
progressive disease during the vincristine treatment period,
showing that fat depots can harbor leukemia cells during
chemotherapy. Interestingly, s.c. lymphoma cells have been noted
to form a ‘‘rim’’ around adipocytes, implying a cell-cell interaction
also between these two cell types (28).

Thus, we developed in vitro models that showed that the
adipocyte microenvironment may be a protective niche for
leukemia cells during chemotherapy. First, we show that adipocytes
are as competent as fibroblasts in supporting leukemia cell steadystate growth. This complements recent studies that seem to
suggest that adipocytes impair the proliferation of normal
hematopoietic cells (29), while they support the growth of
malignant cells such as multiple myeloma cells (30). Second, we
show that adipocytes confer a significant protection to leukemia
cells against vincristine, daunorubicin, dexamethasone, and
nilotinib. Thus, adipocytes may actively contribute to leukemia
cell survival in the face of multiagent chemotherapy. Adipocytes
also protected some, although not all established human pre–B
ALL cell lines from vincristine. Interestingly, the one cell line tested
that was not protected by adipocytes, RCH-ACV, harbors the (1;19)
translocation, which is associated with increased sensitivity to
many chemotherapies including vincristine (31). Thus, the inability
of these cells to resist vincristine in the presence of adipocytes may
reflect an overall inability of cells with this translocation to resist
chemotherapy.
We next found that the presence of adipocytes decreases
leukemia apoptosis and increases cell cycling in the face of
vincristine. Adipocytes increased expression of prosurvival signals,
which may shift the apoptotic balance of leukemia cells toward
survival; this effect was maintained in the presence of vincristine.
The main targets of this adipocyte-mediated effect are possibly the
survival genes Bcl-2 and Pim-2. Overexpression of Bcl-2 causes
leukemia cell resistance to several drugs, including vincristine (32),
and high expression of Bcl-2 is strongly predictive of poor outcome
in adults with acute myelogenous leukemia (33). Pim-2 is an
oncogene that promotes growth of hematopoietic cells (34), as well
as leukemia cell survival via multiple mechanisms (35), including
phosphorylation of Bad (36). Indeed, Bad phosphorylation was
increased by adipocytes both with and without vincristine, and this
may be one of the mechanisms by which adipocytes protect
leukemia cells from vincristine. Overall, our finding that adipocytes
alter the balance of apoptotic signals toward survival is consistent
with our finding that they protect leukemia cells from a variety of
chemotherapeutics with different mechanisms of action.

Adipocytes Impair Leukemia Treatment in Mice

It is unknown which specific adipose depots are relevant to
leukemia escape from chemotherapy. Studies on the bone marrow
tumor microenvironment generally ignore the role of adipocytes,
the most abundant stromal cell in adult bone marrow (37). We
showed in vitro that bone marrow–derived adipocytes (OP9 cells)
can protect leukemia cells against vincristine. Since bone marrow
adiposity does not increase substantially with obesity (38), marrow
adipocytes may contribute to leukemia treatment resistance in
both lean and obese patients, but are not likely responsible for the
increased relapse in obese patients.
We also considered that vincristine accumulation in adipose
tissue could be partly responsible for the association between
obesity and leukemia relapse. Our measurements confirmed that
vincristine accumulates in adipocytes more than in other cells such
as fibroblasts, although this did not affect drug levels in the
medium or leukemia cells. This was not unexpected, as in this
uncomplicated system a single monolayer of adipocytes was
exposed to a comparably large volume of media. In vivo, vincristine
concentrations in blood and tissue were well-matched between
obese and nonobese mice after a single i.v. injection. However, this
injection was dosed proportional to body weight. In clinical
practice, chemotherapies such as vincristine are dosed in
proportion to body surface area, which leads to lower doses per
kilogram body weight in older and more overweight children—
patients at higher risk of relapse. This underdosing may be
compounded by the fact that chemotherapy doses are often
‘‘capped’’ to prevent dose-dependent toxicities. If obesity does lead
to lower vincristine exposure in children, then this could be a
significant factor in clinical outcome, particularly given the
increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide. Pharmacokinetic
experiments in obese patients will be needed to rigorously address
this issue (39–41).

In summary, our findings show that obesity can directly impair
the antileukemia efficacy of the first-line chemotherapy, vincristine.
This effect is likely due in part to adipocytes interacting with
leukemia cells, as their presence in coculture leads to impaired
leukemia killing by this and other drugs. The protective effects of
adipocytes may also contribute to poorer prognosis of obese
patients with other malignancies, as adipose tissue has been
suggested to play a protective role in the microenvironment of
breast (42) and colon (43) cancer. However, further studies are
necessary to elucidate the effects of adipocytes to alter chemotherapy pharmacokinetics, secrete cancer survival factors, or both.
Given that 32% of children are overweight and 16% are obese (44),
understanding the associations between adiposity and increased
morbidity from leukemia and other cancers (breast, colon, and
prostate) will be crucial in preventing a significant number of
patient deaths.
