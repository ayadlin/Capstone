BACKGROUND. The current study was conducted to evaluate the association between colony-stimulating factor
(CSF) use and the risk of developing therapy-related myelodysplastic syndromes or acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/
AML) among a large cohort of elderly patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) who were treated with chemotherapy. METHODS. A total of 13,203 NHL patients were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results-Medicare database who were diagnosed from 1992 through 2002. Patients were followed from their initial
chemotherapy date until the date they were diagnosed with t-MDS/AML, death, or last follow-up (October 31, 2006),
whichever occurred first. RESULTS. Overall, 40% (n ¼ 5266) of patients received CSF. During the follow-up period
(median follow-up, 2.9 years [range, 1-14.7 years]), 272 (5.2%) patients who were treated with CSF developed t-MDS/
AML, compared with 230 (2.9%) patients who did not (P < .0001, log-rank test). The 5-year incidence of t-MDS/AML
for patients receiving CSF was 14.1 per 1000 person-years compared with 8.3 per 1000 person-years for patients not
receiving CSF. In a multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for gender, histology, stage, comorbidities, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy agent, CSF use was found to be independently associated with a 53% increased risk of
t-MDS/AML (hazard ratio [HR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.26-1.84). The observed association between
CSF use and t-MDS/AML persisted across histologic subgroups (ie, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and others). Patients who received both CSF and antimetabolite chemotherapy were found to have a 2.5fold increased risk of t-MDS/AML (HR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.91-3.26) compared with patients who received neither agent.
CONCLUSIONS. The current study, which to our knowledge is the first large population-based study published to
date, demonstrated that the administration of CSF among elderly NHL patients receiving chemotherapy was associC 2010

Therapy -related myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (t-MDS/AML), defined as MDS or AML
occurring after chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, are devastating long-term complications of cancer therapy. Initially
recognized >30 years ago in patients with multiple myeloma who were treated with melphalan, these complications have
been reported subsequent to the treatment of many cancers.1,2 The general use of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy has
improved cancer survival; however, it has been reported that 1% to 15% of long-term cancer survivors treated with combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy develop t-MDS/AML.3 Among non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients treated
with chemotherapy, most studies have reported a 10-year cumulative risk ranging from 4.6% to 10%.4-10 Prognosis after
a diagnosis of t-MDS/AML is bleak, with a median survival of <2 years.11

Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
and granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) are supportive care agents intended to minimize the risk of febrile neutropenia in patients receiving
intensive chemotherapy. There has been speculation suggesting that G-CSF and GM-CSF (collectively referred to
as CSFs) may be associated with an increased risk of tMDS/AML. As early as 1996, Brodsky et al12 suggested
that the increased risk of AML noted in patients enrolled
in clinical trials may be at least partially attributed to CSF
administration among patients receiving intensive chemotherapy. Numerous clinical trials have monitored for
t-MDS/AML as adverse events13-20 after chemotherapy,
and some studies have addressed the question specifically.21-23 Recently, 2 studies using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database
have explored this relation in a population-based cohort
of breast cancer patients21,22; 1 study found a positive
association,21 whereas the other study found no association.22 In what to our knowledge is the only other population-based study published to date, also conducted among
patients with breast cancer, a positive association was found.23
In what to our knowledge is the only published study among
patients with a hematologic malignancy, Relling et al13 found
that pediatric leukemia patients receiving G-CSF had an
increased risk of developing t-MDS/AML.
Although NHL is known to be very responsive to
intensive chemotherapy, elderly patients are particularly
susceptible to the detrimental myelosuppressive effects of
chemotherapy.24 Therefore, the potential benefit of CSF
therapy is likely to be significant among elderly patients
with NHL because of the possibility of allowing for more
dose-intense and dose-dense therapies while decreasing
the likelihood of neutropenia. In fact, recently updated
American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations
consider age as 1 condition for which the prophylactic use
of growth factors may be indicated, regardless of the risk
of neutropenia.25
The incidence of t-MDS/AML among NHL
patients is among the highest of any cancer type,10 possibly because of the underlying susceptibility of this patient
population to hematologic malignancies. Therefore, we
posit that although it is plausible that NHL patients, especially elderly patients, may benefit from the therapeutic
effects of CSFs, they also may be particularly susceptible
to the potential long-term leukemogenic effects of these
agents. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to
explore the relation between CSF use and the incidence of
t-MDS/AML among a large nationwide and population-

5280

based cohort of elderly patients with NHL receiving
chemotherapy with up to 15 years of follow-up.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source
The current study used data from the merged SEER-Medicare database. The SEER database program is a population-based registry sponsored by the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) that contains information regarding all
newly diagnosed cancer cases. This study included the following geographic areas: Detroit, Atlanta, and Seattle;
and the states of California, Connecticut, Iowa, New
Mexico, Utah, Hawaii, Kentucky, Louisiana, and New
Jersey. SEER data are highly valid and complete, with a
completeness of case ascertainment of >98%.26
The SEER registry collects information concerning
patient demographics, tumor characteristics, stage at diagnosis, treatment within 4 months of diagnosis, and date
and cause of death. This registry data are linked to claims
data from Medicare, which is the primary insurer for
approximately 97% of the US population aged 65 years.
All Medicare beneficiaries receive Part A coverage, which
covers inpatient care, skilled nursing, home healthcare,
and hospice care. Approximately 95% of beneficiaries also
subscribe to Part B of Medicare to obtain benefits that
cover physician services and outpatient care.26 The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston
approved the current study.
Study Population and Patient Characteristics
This retrospective cohort study included patients with
incident cases of NHL diagnosed between January 1,
1992 and December 13, 2002 who received chemotherapy within 12 months of their diagnosis. Patients enrolled
in a health maintenance organization during any period
of the study time period were excluded because data were
unavailable for these periods. Patients who did not participate in both Medicare Parts A and B during any month
were also excluded because of potentially incomplete data.
Patients were characterized with respect to clinical
and demographic variables available in the SEER-Medicare database as well as clinical and treatment characteristics that were abstracted from the Medicare claims data.
Because of the reported reliability for differentiating certain histologic subtypes in the SEER data,27 we specifically identified diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
and follicular lymphoma, and grouped the remaining

histologic subtypes as ‘‘other’’ because of the relatively
small number of cases. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy
were characterized and quantified using International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes,
ICD procedural codes, Current Procedural Terminology
(CPT) codes, Healthcare Common Procedural Coding
System codes, and revenue center codes.26 The following
codes were used for defining chemotherapy: ICD-9 Clinical Modification procedure code 9925 for chemotherapy
infusion/injection; CPT codes 96,400 through 96,549,
J9000 through J9999, and Q0083 through Q0085; revenue center codes 0331, 0332, and 0335; and ICD-9 V
codes V58.1, V66.2, and V67.2. Chemotherapy use was
stratified by type (eg, alkylating agents, topoisomerase II
inhibitors, anthracyclines, and antimetabolites) using
CPT codes. The use of CSF was identified by the procedure codes of J1440 and J1441 (for G-CSF) and J2820
(for GM-CSF). The incidence of secondary MDS/AML
was identified by 2 claims with a primary or secondary
diagnosis of AML/MDS (ICD-9 codes: myeloid leukemia
[205.xx], monocytic leukemia [206.xx], and MDS
[238.7]) occurring 30 days apart from each other, with
the initial diagnosis occurring 1 year after the diagnosis
of NHL. Claims before diagnosis were used to identify
pre-existing comorbidities. Comorbidities were aggregated to formulate the NCI comorbidity index, a revised
version of the Charlson comorbidity index.28
Data Analysis
Patients were described with respect to demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics overall and were stratified according to CSF use to identify potential underlying
differences across exposure strata of the population. We
used chi-square tests and Student t tests to compare differences in patients by CSF status. Kaplan-Meier graphs and
corresponding log-rank tests were used to compare the
incidence of t-MDS/AML by CSF use. Follow-up time
was defined as the time from the initial chemotherapy
start date to the first diagnosis of t-MDS/AML. Patients
who did not develop t-MDS/AML were censored at the
date of death or the end-of-study date (October 31,
2006), whichever occurred first. Cox proportional hazards
modeling was used to estimate the association between
CSF use and the development of t-MDS/AML after controlling for potential confounders. The proportionality
assumption was confirmed using the goodness-of-fit test
developed by Harrell and Lee.29 To further control for
confounding, we calculated a propensity score and
included this in a separate Cox regression model. Briefly,

Cancer

this score was calculated based on the probability of
receiving CSF as calculated using logistic regression analysis in which CSF status (yes vs no) was the dependent
variable and patient demographic/clinical/treatment characteristics were considered as possible independent variables. Finally, because of plausible interactive effects
between CSF use and specific chemotherapy agents on the
risk of t-MDS/AML, we evaluated these interactions by
including the product term of CSF and the specific chemotherapy agent in separate Cox regression models.

RESULTS
We identified 13,203 NHL patients from the SEERMedicare database who received chemotherapy within 12
months of their diagnosis and met the other eligibility criteria for this study. The overall median age of the patients
at the time of diagnosis was 74 years (range, 65-102
years). Approximately 53% (n ¼ 7051) of patients were
female, and a large majority (n ¼ 11,776; 89%) were
non-Hispanic white and lived in an urban setting (n ¼
11,877; 90%). Approximately 44% (n ¼ 5861) of
patients had a diagnosis of DLBCL, 18% (n ¼ 2428) had
follicular lymphoma, 28% (n ¼ 3665) had other histologies, and 9% (n ¼ 1249) had an unknown histology.
Patient distribution according to stage of disease at diagnosis was 29% (n ¼ 3564) of patients with stage I disease,
18% (n ¼ 2214) with stage II disease, 16% (n ¼ 1971)
with stage III disease, and 37% (n ¼ 4519) with stage IV
disease (grading determined according to the American
Joint Committee on Cancer staging system). A large majority (n ¼ 8216; 62%) of patients had a low comorbidity
burden (comorbidity index, 1).
Tables 1 and 2 show patient demographic, clinical,
and treatment characteristics according to CSF use. Overall, approximately 40% (n ¼ 5266) of patients who were
treated with chemotherapy received CSF during the follow-up period. The majority of patients treated with CSF
received only G-CSF (n ¼ 4581; 87%), whereas 316
(6%) received only GM-CSF and 369 (7%) received both
G-CSF and GM-CSF. Patients treated with CSF were
more likely to have been diagnosed recently. Although
other statistically significant differences were observed
according to CSF status (urban residence, age at diagnosis,
race/ethnicity, marital status, socioeconomic status, stage
of disease, and histology), the magnitude of these
observed differences was relatively small (Table 1). With
regard to patient treatment, those who received CSF were
more likely to be treated with agents known to be associated with the development of t-MDS/AML. For example,

92% (n ¼ 4851) of patients receiving CSF were treated
with alkylating agents compared with 77% (n ¼ 6100) of
patients not receiving CSF, and 33% (n ¼ 1728) of patients
receiving CSF were treated with topoisomerase II inhibitors
compared with 20% (n ¼ 1600) of those not receiving
CSF. Furthermore, patients receiving CSF were found to
have a significantly higher number of chemotherapy administration services (mean, 27 days vs 13 days; P < .0001).
Figure 1 shows the cumulative incidence of t-MDS/
AML according to the use of CSF and by the number of
CSF claims (in quartiles). After a median follow-up of 2.9
years (range, 1-14.7 years), 502 (3.8%) patients developed
t-MDS/AML. Of those patients who did not develop tMDS/AML (n ¼ 12,701), 68% (n ¼ 8589) died whereas
32% (n ¼ 4112) of patients were alive without evidence
of t-MDS/AML at the end of the follow-up period. The
median time to the development of t-MDS/AML was 3
years (range, 1-12 years). Over the follow-up period, a
total of 272 (5.2%) patients receiving CSF developed tMDS/AML compared with 230 (2.9%) patients who did
not receive CSF (P <.0001, log-rank test). The 3-year
incidence of t-MDS/AML for patients receiving CSF was

13.2 per 1000 person-years compared with 6.9 per 1000
person-years for patients not receiving CSF (95% confidence interval [95% CI] for rate difference, 3.7-8.8 cases/
1000 person-years). The 5-year incidence of t-MDS/
AML for patients receiving CSF was 14.1 per 1000 person-years compared with 8.3 per 1000 person-years for
patients not receiving CSF (95% CI for rate difference,
3.6-8.1 cases/1000 person-years). When we evaluated the
cumulative incidence of t-MDS/AML by number of CSF
claims (categorized by quartile)(Fig. 2), we found a significant dose-response effect (P < .0001. log-rank test) with
the incidence noted to be increasing by quartile. Those in
the highest quartile (23 claims) had a 10-year cumulative incidence of 21%, followed by those in the third quartile (10-22 claims; 15%), those in the second quartile (4-9
claims; 13%), and those in the first quartile (1-3 claims;
12%). The lowest incidence (8%) was noted among
patients who received no CSF.
Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate the association between CSF use and time to the development of t-MDS/AML after adjusting for potential
confounders (Table 3). CSF use remained significantly

associated with the risk of developing t-MDS/AML (hazard ratio [HR], 1.53; 95% CI, 1.26-1.84) after adjusting
for gender, histology, stage, comorbidities, chemotherapy
service claims, and chemotherapy agent. The dose-response
effect remained significant, with an increasing risk noted by
quartile of more CSF claims. To further control for confounding, we included a propensity score to adjust for the
baseline probability of receiving CSF in a separate model
and found that CSF use remained significantly associated,
with a 42% increased risk of t-MDS/AML (HR, 1.42;
95% CI, 1.18-3.98). Again, patients receiving more doses
of CSF were found to have the higher risk of developing
t-MDS/AML (HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.40-2.40).
In analyses stratified by histologic subtype, we
found that CSF use remained a significant predictor of
developing t-MDS/AML for patients within each of the
major histologic subgroups. For patients with DLBCL,
CSF use was found to be associated with a 36%
increased risk of developing t-MDS/AML (HR, 1.36;
95% CI, 1.04-1.89); for patients with follicular lym-

5284

phoma, there was a 90% increased risk (HR, 1.90; 95%
CI, 1.21-2.98); and for patients with other histologic
types, there was an 80% increased risk (HR, 1.80; 95%
CI, 1.30-2.49).
We tested for interactions between CSF use and
chemotherapy agents on the risk of developing t-MDS/
AML. No significant interactions were observed between
CSF and alkylating agents, topoisomerase II inhibitors,
anthracyclines, or vinca alkaloids. However, we did find a
significant interaction between CSF and antimetabolite
use (P for interaction, .04). Patients who were treated
with both antimetabolites and CSFs were found to have a
2.5-fold increased risk of developing t-MDS/AML (HR,
2.49; 95% CI, 1.91-3.26) compared with patients who
received neither agent (Fig. 1).

The results of the current study support our hypothesis
that CSF use among elderly patients with NHL who are

receiving chemotherapy was significantly associated with
an increased risk of developing t-MDS/AML. We found
that CSF use overall was associated with a 1.5-fold
increased risk of developing t-MDS/AML, which
increased with increasing numbers/doses of CSFs. This
association persisted within histologic subtypes. In addition, we found a significant interaction between CSF use
and antimetabolite chemotherapy. Patients who received
both CSFs and antimetabolites had a 2.5-fold increased
risk of developing t-MDS/AML. This finding has clinical
significance considering that approximately 10% of the
overall population received this therapeutic combination.

These results are in keeping with previous studies of
t-MDS/AML occurring among NHL patients.4-9 We
found that the 10-year cumulative risk of t-MDS/AML
ranged from approximately 5% to 10% depending on CSF
status, which is very similar to the range of 4.6% to 10%
reported in previous studies.4-9 The main outlier was the
subset of the current study population who received both
antimetabolites and a CSF, who were found to have a
10-year cumulative incidence of approximately 25% (Fig. 2).
The biological plausibility behind the hypothesis
that CSFs may be leukemogenic is based on the observation that CSFs not only stimulate the proliferation and
differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, but also interfere with apoptosis.12 This suppression of apoptotic cell
regulation could contribute to a leukemogenic effect of
growth factors either independently or by interacting with
cytotoxic therapies. Lieschke et al30 reported that CSF
induced the growth of AML blast cells in vitro in approximately 50% of cases; however, they were not found to be
leukemogenic.
An important finding of the current study was the
interactive effect between CSF and antimetabolite therapy
on the risk of t-MDS/AML. Several studies have demonstrated an increased risk of t-MDS/AML among patients
receiving nucleoside analogue therapy, including antimetabolite therapy.31 These agents incorporate themselves
into the DNA, leading to DNA damage and interference
with repair pathways.31-36 Therefore, it is plausible that
antimetabolites might interact synergistically with the
proliferative and/or antiapoptotic activity of CSFs to initiate and then facilitate leukemogenesis.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large
nationwide and population-based study to evaluate the
association between CSF use and the risk of t-MDS/AML
among patients with NHL. The strengths of this study
include the use of SEER-Medicare data, which allows for
the design of large population-based studies of long-term
outcomes after cancer therapy. Although many clinical trials of CSF use that monitored for t-MDS/AML as an
adverse event were hampered by insufficient follow-up
time or smaller sample size, the current study had a large
population with a long follow-up period. In addition,
although clinical trial data typically have strong internal
validity, the application of a sound study design to population-based data has the potential to yield results that are
more generalizable to community-based care and may be
more reflective of real-world outcomes. Furthermore, the
focus on elderly patients with NHL also has clinical significance, because this is a population for whom treatment

choice is not straightforward and therefore the identification of patient subpopulations that may be at an increased
risk for adverse events (including t-MDS/AML) could provide valuable guidance in delineating treatment options.
The current study had its limitations. Although the
results are more generalizable to the elderly Medicare population, they may have limited application to younger
populations and to populations covered under managed
care or other private insurance. However, as the aging
population continues to grow in the United States, it will
become increasingly important to focus attention on this
demographic cohort. Other limitations are related to the
nature of the data used to conduct this study. By using
claims data, one cannot fully quantify and control for
chemotherapy dose and intensity, which are likely significant confounders. We did attempt to control for this confounding by including the number of chemotherapy
administrations as a covariate in the multivariable analyses. Although this might be considered a reasonable proxy
for dose and intensity, the possibility for residual confounding remains. In addition, the ‘‘other’’ category of
NHL included many types of NHL that may be heterogeneous with regard to receiving chemotherapy and CSF,
and the risk of t-MDS/AML. Small sample sizes of
patients with these subtypes of NHL limited the generation of meaningful results, thus requiring caution when
interpreting the findings of the current study for these
subtypes combined. Furthermore, because of the inability
to determine exact dosing for CSF, it was not possible to
categorize dosing according to clinically meaningful cutpoints; instead, we had to categorize the number of CSF
claims by quartile to evaluate dose-response effect.
Because of the observational nature of the data used for
the current study, it is likely that a certain degree of selection bias was introduced. For example, many patients

Cancer

November 15, 2010

received CSF for the primary prevention of febrile neutropenia and infection, whereas some received it as treatment
after neutropenia and infection. There was no accurate information available from these study data regarding bone
marrow function at the time of CSF use, and therefore it
was difficult to quantify the risk of t-MDS/AML that was
associated with the disease itself or with the receipt of
CSF. In addition, although we studied only those patients
who received chemotherapy within 12 months of diagnosis, the sequence of various chemotherapy agents (such as
first-line or second-line antimetabolite therapy) was not
well ascertained, which might have confounded the study
findings, although we adjusted for the number of chemotherapy claims and the number of CSF claims. We
attempted to thoroughly describe our treatment cohorts
to the greatest extent possible to identify potential confounding factors that might be unbalanced between the 2
comparison groups, and we tried to evaluate this using
separate models and propensity scores to control for selection bias. However, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that there may be factors associated with the use of
CSF that may increase the risk of t-MDS/AML. Therefore,
it will become increasingly important in the future to incorporate more clinically rich data (eg, emergency room visits
and laboratory data) into studies to explore the causal
mechanisms underlying observed associations. Future studies should also incorporate markers of genetic susceptibility
to fully evaluate the etiology of t-MDS/AML.
In conclusion, this population-based study documented that CSF use among elderly patients with NHL
who are treated with chemotherapy was associated with an
increased risk of developing t-MDS/AML. These findings, suggesting an interactive effect between CSF and
antimetabolites on the risk of developing t-MDS/AML,
highlight the potential clinical importance of exploring

5287

Original Article

plausible interactions between therapeutic agents in the
‘‘real world.’’ Further studies, both observational and clinical, are necessary to verify these results in younger population and to determine the potential clinical implications
of this observed interaction. These studies should evaluate
CSF use relative to other clinical outcomes as well as its
cost-effectiveness to more fully explain the appropriate
use of CSF in the care of elderly patients with NHL.
