Abstract
Interaction of cyclin D1 with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK)
results in the hyperphosphorylation of the RB family of
proteins, thereby inactivating the tumor-suppressive function
of RB. Our previous findings suggest that constitutive cyclin
D1/CDK activity inhibits p53-mediated gene repression by
preventing the appropriate regulation of CDK activity by the
CDK inhibitor p21, a transcriptional target of p53. To study
the role of cyclin D1 in driving human mammary cell
transformation, we expressed a constitutively active cyclin
D1–CDK fusion protein (D1/CDK) in immortalized human
mammary epithelial cells. D1/CDK-expressing human mammary epithelial cells grew anchorage-independently in the
presence of wild-type p53, consistent with the idea that
D1/CDK disrupts downstream p53 signaling. Using this
transformation model, we examined the sensitivity of the
D1/CDK-expressing cells to Nutlin-3, an HDM2 antagonist that
activates p53. Surprisingly, treatment of D1/CDK-transformed
cells with Nutlin-3 prevented their anchorage-independent
growth. The Nutlin-3–induced growth arrest was enforced in
D1/CDK-expressing cells despite the presence of hyperphosphorylated RB implicating a p53-dependent, RB-independent
mechanism for growth suppression. Further analysis identified that CDC2 and cyclin B1, key cell cycle regulators, were
stably down-regulated following p53 stabilization by Nutlin-3,
consistent with direct interaction between p53 and the CDC2
and cyclin B1 promoters, leading to the repression of transcription by methylation. In contrast to D1/CDK expression,
direct inactivation of p53 resulted in no repression of CDC2
and no cell cycle arrest. We conclude that induction of p53
by Nutlin-3 is a viable therapeutic strategy in cancers with
constitutive CDK signaling due to the direct repression of
specific p53 target genes. [Cancer Res 2007;67(20):9862–8]

Introduction
Cyclin D1 complexes with cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) to
promote the G1-S transition by phosphorylating RB family
members, releasing E2F from inhibitory interactions with RB/
p130/p107, and de-repressing genes critical for cell cycle progression (1, 2). The p53 tumor suppressor is closely linked with the RB
family, playing an essential role in preventing cell cycle progression
following oncogenic or genotoxic stress by transcriptionally
activating the CDK inhibitor p21, which binds to cyclin-CDK

complexes to the inhibit kinase activity that is necessary for cell
cycle progression (3). Cyclin D1 is commonly overexpressed in
breast cancer. The high levels of cyclin D1–CDK4 and cyclin
D1–CDK2 complexes which result drive the constitutive hyperphosphorylation of RB, thereby inactivating its tumor-suppressive
functions (4, 5).
To model the effects of hyperactive CDK activity, Chytil et al.
(6) created a cyclin D1–CDK2 fusion protein that phosphorylates
RB on sites preferred by CDK2 and CDK4, and promotes the
anchorage-independent growth of mink lung epithelial cells (6).
In addition, we reported previously that the cyclin D1–CDK2 fusion
protein could inhibit the repression of a number of genes normally
repressed in response to p53 activation. The pathway required for
this repression involves the activation of p53 in response to DNA
damage or p14ARF induction, transcriptional activation of p21
by p53, CDK inhibition by p21, and finally, RB-E2F–dependent
repression of transcription. Inactivation of p53 by overexpression of
HDM2 or use of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to p53, overexpression
of cyclin D1 or cyclin E, or inactivation of RB by the adenoviral E7
protein abrogated the repression of genes required for cell cycle
progression, including PLK1 (7).
As our knowledge of the roles of specific genes and pathways
involved in cancer increases, new strategies for treatment evolve.
For instance, rather than developing chemotherapies that kill
rapidly dividing cells, including normal cells, efforts are now being
directed toward specific mutations. The Nutlin compounds are an
excellent example of a directed therapy. They stabilize p53 by
competing for binding to the negative regulator HDM2, preventing
these two proteins from interacting. The stabilization of wild-type
p53 by Nutlin-3 in tumor cell lines and xenographs in nude mice
leads to toxicity and prevents tumor growth (8). The Nutlins induce
p53-dependent apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells that
harbor wild-type p53 and have also been shown to be effective
against Kaposi’s sarcoma herpes virus–induced lymphoma (9, 10).
Additionally, treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with Nutlin-3
sensitizes the cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (11).
Although this activity of the Nutlins holds great promise for
improved therapeutic approaches, we and others have recently
shown that normal and transformed cells overexpressing HdmX,
a protein with significant homology to HDM2, are resistant to
Nutlin-3 (12–14). The failure of Nutlin-3 to affect HdmX-p53
interactions raises important questions regarding the utility of
activating wild-type p53 as a therapeutic approach, warranting
additional study of the potential use of such therapies.
To construct a physiologic model to examine the effects of
cyclin D1 overexpression and to assess the therapeutic value of
Nutlin-3 on cyclin D1–expressing cells, we transformed immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) using a cyclin
D1/CDK2 (D1/CDK) fusion protein. The D1/CDK-expressing cells
grew anchorage-independently regardless of whether p53 was
present or not, consistent with the inactivation of p53 signaling by

hyperactive CDK. However, despite the transformed phenotype,
the growth of D1/CDK-expressing cells could be prevented by
treatment with Nutlin-3, which engaged a p53-dependent repression of important cell cycle regulators, such as CDC2 and cyclin
B1, independently of RB. We conclude that compounds which
activate wild-type p53, such as the Nutlins, may effectively prevent
tumor growth by stabilizing p53, resulting in the direct repression
of promoters necessary for cell cycle progression, independently of
p53-p21-RB–mediated gene repression.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions. hTERT-HME1 cells were purchased
from (Clontech) and grown in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2
in Medium 171 with mammary epithelial growth supplement (Cascade
Biologics) and 50 units/mL of penicillin and 50 Ag/mL of streptomycin
sulfate (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). HCT116 cells were grown in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in DMEM (with glucose and L-glutamine;
Life Technologies) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 units/mL of penicillin and 50 Ag/mL of streptomycin sulfate (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). Cells
were plated 24 h before Nutlin-3 (Cayman Chemical) or etoposide (Sigma)
was added to the fresh medium. For survival and growth assays, medium
containing Nutlin-3 or etoposide was removed after 24 or 72 h for HCT116
and hTERT-HME-1 cells, respectively, and replaced with fresh medium. The
cells were grown to near confluence (f1 week) before staining with
methylene blue in 50% methanol. The stain was quantified following
extraction with 0.5 mol/L of HCl by reading the absorbance at 595 nm.
Plasmids and retroviral infection. WZL-blast-MF-p110a was kindly
provided by William Hahn (Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) and the IRES-blast marker was replaced by an
SV40-puro cassette, using the SalI and NheI sites (15). pBabe-puro-cyclin D1/
CDK2 (6) was kindly provided by Brian Law (Department of Pharmacology
and Therapeutics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL). The SV40-puro
cassette was replaced with a SV40-bleo cassette from pBabe-Bleo, using the
SalI and ClaI sites. The Flag-HdmX and shRNA constructs and protocols for
virus production and infection of cells have been described elsewhere (12).
Soft agar assays. For hTERT-HME1 cells, 2  105 per 60 mm dish, were
suspended in 0.6% type VII agarose (Sigma) and plated onto a bottom layer
of 1.2% agar. For Nutlin-3 treatment, cells were plated into soft agar and
grown for 120 h, after which 1 mL of Medium 171, with 0, 5, or 10 Amol/L of
Nutlin-3, was added to the top agar. The medium was changed every 3 days
until cells were analyzed (after f3 weeks). In HCT116 cells, 4  104 cells
were plated per dish and 1 mL of DMEM with 0, 3, or 9 Amol/L of Nutlin-3
was added 24 h after plating. The medium was changed every 3 days until
cells were analyzed (after f8 days). Plates were analyzed using Metamorph,
in which 5  5 or 10  10 stitched images were counted and multiplied to
give colony counts for the whole plate.
Dose responses. hTERT-HME1 cells were plated at 1  106 per 10 cm
dish and treated with 0, 6, 9, or 12 mmol/L of Nutlin-3 for 48 h. Cells were
then harvested and analyzed by the Western method.
Western analysis. Whole cell extracts were prepared by incubating cell
pellets in lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/L of Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L of
NaCl, 1.0% NP40, 10 Ag/mL of aprotinin, 100 Ag/mL of phenylmethane sulfonyl
fluoride, 5 Ag/mL of leupeptin, 5 Ag/mL of pepstatin, and 1 mmol/L of NaVO4.
Cell extracts containing equal quantities of proteins, determined by the
Bradford method, were separated by SDS-PAGE (8–12.5% acrylamide) and
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Antibodies to
p53 (DO-1), p21 (C19), CDC2 p34 (C17), cyclin D1 (C-20), cyclin B1 (GNS1), and
RB (C-15) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; antibodies to HDM2 2A10, IF2,
and 4B11 were from Oncogene Research Products; antibodies to h-actin (pan
Ab-5) were from Neomarkers, antibodies to phospho-p53 (Ser15) were from Cell
Signaling; antibodies to phospho-RB (T249/252) were from Biosource; and
antibodies to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were from Calbiochem. Primary antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse or goat antirabbit conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Hoffman-La Roche), using
enhanced chemiluminescence (Perkin-Elmer).

Cell staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Cells
(1  106 per 10 cm dish) were treated with Nutlin-3 for 48 h and then with
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 4 h. Cells harvested with trypsin
(including floating cells) were fixed in 70% ethanol, washed with washing
buffer (PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin) before being
denatured in 2 mol/L of HCl for 20 min. Denatured cells were washed
in washing buffer and any remaining acid was neutralized with 0.1 mol/L
of Na2B4O7 (pH 8.5). Cells were washed again before staining with FITCconjugated mouse anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (BD PharMingen),
20 AL plus 30 AL of dilution buffer (PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and
0.5% bovine serum albumin). Cells were then resuspended in propidium
iodide (10 Ag/mL) in PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. For each
sample, 20,000 cells were analyzed.
Relative growth assay. hTERT-HME1 cells were plated in triplicate at
8,000 cells/well in a 48-well plate and grown for 6 days, until near
confluence. Each well was then washed with 0.25 PBS and frozen with
Milli-Q water at 20jC. To stain the cells, plates were thawed and DNA
standards were prepared in a separate plate. Hoechst stain (10 Ag/mL) in
Tris–NaCl–EDTA was added to each well and incubated for 2 h. A plate
reader was used to measure the amount of DNA per well by exciting
fluorescence at 360 nm and measuring emission at 460 nm. DNA quantities
were estimated by comparison to the standard curve.

Results
Transformation of immortalized mammary epithelial cells
by a constitutively active CDK. Disruption of the p53 and RB
pathways by SV40 large T antigen, together with constitutively
activated phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), transforms immortalized HMECs (15). To avoid the use of viral proteins and to develop
a model to study cyclin D1–mediated transformation, we evaluated
HME1 cells (nontumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells
immortalized with hTERT) expressing a cyclin D1/CDK fusion
protein to inhibit RB, a shRNA to inhibit p53 and a constitutively
active PI3K. HME1 cells were infected with retroviruses capable of
expressing these components, in parallel with control vectors and
the expression levels and functionality of the expressed proteins
were examined using the Western method (Fig. 1A and B). Cells
expressing PI3K had higher levels of phosphorylated AKT,
indicating that the PI3K was constitutively active. Inhibition of
p53 led to a further increase in phosphorylated AKT, probably due
to the inhibition of endogenous PTEN expression (16, 17).
Expression of FLAG-labeled D1/CDK was confirmed by Western
analysis. The level of p53 was increased modestly in cells expressing
D1/CDK, probably due to the replicative stress initiated by
inappropriate entry into S phase, as recently described for several
different oncogenes (18, 19). In addition, the level of p21 was
significantly higher in cells expressing D1/CDK compared with
controls or cells expressing PI3K, probably due to the incorporation
of p21 into D1/CDK complexes (6).
Each population of cells was plated into soft agar to test for
anchorage-independent growth, a hallmark of transformed cells.
Surprisingly, cells expressing only D1/CDK formed colonies in soft
agar efficiently, independently of PI3K or p53 status (Fig. 1C). Cells
expressing D1/CDK, alone or together with PI3K, with or without
shp53, gave rise to 25 times more colonies per field compared with
controls or cells expressing PI3K only. We conclude that HME1
cells with constitutive CDK activity have acquired everything
needed for transformation in vitro, as judged by the ability to grow
anchorage-independently.
HME1 cells transformed by D1/CDK are susceptible to a
p53-dependent, RB-independent growth arrest following
treatment with Nutlin-3. Our previous studies of cancer cell lines

have delineated a pathway from p53 activation (in response to DNA
damage or the expression of p14ARF) to the inhibition of the RB
family phosphorylation by the CDK inhibitor p21 (7). Consistent
with CDK-mediated RB phosphorylation, the constitutive expression of D1/CDK or cyclin E led to impaired repression of a number
of genes normally repressed by the RB family (7). Therefore, we
expected that the p53-mediated arrest activated in response to
Nutlin-3 would be abrogated in the HME1 cells expressing D1/CDK.
To test this, D1/CDK-expressing cells with and without shp53 were
plated into soft agar and treated with 5 or 10 Amol/L of Nutlin-3 for
3 weeks (Fig. 2A; Supplemental Fig. S1). There was a 96% decrease
in the number of soft agar colonies formed when D1/CDK cells
were treated with either dose of Nutlin-3 versus a 50% decrease
when D1/CDK-shp53 cells were treated with Nutlin-3. This result is
surprising because the p53-p21-RB pathway should be unable to
repress genes necessary for cell cycle progression due to the
constitutive activity of CDK, which should keep RB in a hyperphosphorylated state, resulting in continued proliferation. Therefore, to confirm that the D1/CDK-expressing cells maintained RB in
a hyperphosphorylated state, Western analysis was done using a
phosphospecific antibody. As expected, RB remained hyperphosphorylated in D1/CDK-expressing cells following Nutlin-3 treatment (Fig. 2B).
Western analysis revealed an equivalent increase in the levels
of p53 and its transcriptional target HDM2 in the control and
D1/CDK-expressing cells. This result was also confirmed using a
wider range of Nutlin-3 concentrations, indicating that p53 is
equivalently activated in control and D1/CDK-expressing cells

(Supplemental Fig. S2A). We also confirmed that control and D1/
CDK-expressing cells have similar growth rates, as determined in a
6-day growth assay (Supplemental Fig. S2B). Interestingly, although
the level of phosphorylated RB did not decrease in D1/CDKexpressing cells, the total amount of RB decreased in both control
and D1/CDK cells (Fig. 2B). This effect is probably due to the
increased expression of HDM2, which promotes the ubiquitinmediated degradation of RB (20), and suggests that a higher
proportion of the total RB within the cell is phosphorylated.
Additional studies will be needed to determine how the limiting
levels of RB are phosphorylated more efficiently.
Despite the increased RB phosphorylation, which should provide
a greater signal for cell cycle progression, the growth of D1/CDKexpressing cells is still inhibited efficiently. Because HME1
derivatives treated with Nutlin-3 show no signs of apoptosis on
tissue culture dishes, it is likely that the mechanism by which
Nutlin-3 suppresses anchorage-independent growth also involves
the induction of cell cycle arrest. This conclusion is supported by
our observation that BCL2 expression does not promote the
anchorage-independent growth of HME1 cells (data not shown),
indicating that inhibiting apoptosis alone is not sufficient to
promote transformation. In contrast to control and D1/CDKexpressing cells, Nutlin-3 treatment of cells expressing shp53
alone, D1/CDK and shp53 together, or HdmX resulted in minimal
growth inhibition relative to untreated cells in long-term growth
assays (Supplemental Fig. S2C and D; ref. 12). In addition,
expression of HdmX or shp53 resulted in no change in the levels
of total RB or hyperphosphorylated RB (Fig. 2B and C).

Figure 1. hTERT-HME1 cells are transformed by D1/CDK regardless of p53 status. HME1 cells were infected with amphotropic retroviruses encoding D1/CDK, PI3K,
or shRNA against p53, or with control vectors. A, cells expressing PI3K with shp53 or shSCR (scrambled control) were examined by the Western method for the
levels of FLAG-PI3K and phosphorylated AKT. B, cells expressing PI3K and D1/CDK, separately or together, with the addition of shp53 or shSCR, were analyzed by the
Western method for levels of p53, HDM2, FLAG-D1/CDK, and p21. C, cells grown in soft agar were counted.

Nutlin-3 Arrests Cyclin D–Transformed Cells

Figure 2. Constitutively active D1/CDK does not protect against p53 induction by Nutlin-3 and prevents p53-mediated hypophosphorylation of RB, but does not
prevent down-regulation of CDC2. A, control, shp53, D1/CDK, and D1/CDK-shp53 cells were grown in soft agar for 5 d, treated with Nutlin-3 for 3 wk, and then
quantitated. B and C, cells expressing D1/CDK, HdmX or shp53 were treated with 5 Amol/L of Nutlin-3 for 72 h and analyzed by the Western method.

We next examined the level of CDC2 protein because the CDC2
gene is commonly down-regulated following the induction of p53p21-RB signaling (21). Surprisingly, CDC2 was repressed similarly in
both control and D1/CDK cells, even though differences in the
phosphorylation of RB were pronounced. To confirm that cells
expressing D1/CDK arrested similarly to control cells, we labeled
them with BrdUrd (Fig. 3A). Cells were treated with Nutlin-3 for
48 h and the percentage of cells in S phase was determined after
a 4-h pulse with BrdUrd. Again, control cells and cells expressing
D1/CDK showed similar decreases in the percentage of cells in
S phase, 83% and 77%, respectively. In contrast, the percentage of
shp53 cells in S phase did not change and that of cells expressing
HdmX decreased by only 25% compared with untreated controls
(Fig. 3B), consistent with the inability of Nutlin-3 to alter CDC2
protein expression in these cells (Fig. 2B and C).
Therefore, we conclude that, although constitutively active D1/
CDK promoted the constitutive hyperphosphorylation of RB,
and was sufficient for anchorage-independent growth, CDC2 was
still repressed efficiently following Nutlin-3 treatment, in a p53dependent but RB-independent manner. The 12-fold increase in
soft agar growth by the D1/CDK-expressing cells following p53
ablation and Nutlin-3 treatment indicates that the Nutlin-3–
mediated effects are at least partially p53-dependent, and although
RB is constitutively hyperphosphorylated, p53 can still act efficiently as a tumor suppressor (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the effects
of Nutlin-3, whereby the different genetic alterations affected the
sensitivity to the treatment, we found that etoposide treatment

www.aacrjournals.org

resulted in similar levels of growth inhibition in all HME1
derivatives tested (Supplemental Fig. S3).
To determine whether the growth inhibition of D1/CDK cells
was due to the continued repression of genes even after the
removal of Nutlin-3, cells treated with Nutlin-3 for 72 h were
examined 24 or 44 h after Nutlin-3 removal, to determine whether
CDC2 was de-repressed. Western analysis showed that p53 and p21
levels decreased similarly in control and D1/CDK cells during the
period of recovery from Nutlin-3 (Fig. 4), indicating that the
induction of p53 in response to Nutlin-3 can be reversed. This
conclusion is further substantiated by the increase in hyperphosphorylated RB in control cells following the 24-h recovery
period. Based on these observations, we might expect that the cells
would re-enter the cell cycle and begin to proliferate. However, the
levels of CDC2 did not increase during the recovery period. Failure
to up-regulate CDC2, and probably other genes that are repressed
in a p53-dependent, RB-independent manner, might explain why
control and D1/CDK cells are unable to reverse the growth arrest
induced by Nutlin-3. Although there is still a significant growth
arrest in D1/CDK-expressing cells following Nutlin-3 treatment, it
was noted that there were consistently more D1/CDK-expressing
cells at the end of the long-term growth assays relative to the
control cells (typically 70–80% growth inhibition for D1/CDK cells
relative to 80–95% growth inhibition for controls). Because there
were f2-fold more cells in S phase following Nutlin treatment of
the D1/CDK-expressing cells relative to control cells (Fig. 3A), a
small subpopulation of cells is probably not arresting completely in

response to Nutlin-3, and therefore, these cells continue to grow
during the 7-day assays, resulting in slightly better growth of
D1/CDK versus control cells.
Cancer cells are susceptible to a p53-dependent, RBindependent growth arrest following treatment with Nutlin-3.
In order to validate the observations made with HME1 cells, we
infected HCT116 colorectal cancer cells with retroviruses encoding
D1/CDK fusion protein as well as shRNAs to green fluorescent
protein (GFP), RB, or p53. These cell lines were treated with
Nutlin-3 at 3 or 9 Amol/L for 24 h and then analyzed by the
Western method (Fig. 5A). In cells expressing shp53, levels of
p53 were significantly decreased whereas other cell lines showed
p53 induction upon Nutlin-3 treatment. Levels of HDM2 and p21
also increased as p53 levels were induced. Again, CDC2 levels
decreased in the shGFP, shRB, and D1/CDK cells, but there was
also a decrease in the level of phosphorylated CDC2 (top band) in
all HCT116 cell lines, except the shp53 cells following Nutlin-3
treatment. This result is consistent with studies demonstrating a

reduction in phosphorylated CDC2 following p53 activation or
overexpression (22). A decrease in cyclin B1 was also observed in
Nutlin-3–treated cells following p53 induction. Cyclin B1 influences
the phosphorylation status of CDC2 because CDC2/cyclin B1
complexes are a better substrate than CDC2 alone for the kinase
Wee1 (23). As seen in the HME1 cells, cyclin D1 expression (both
endogenous and exogenous) increased in the control, D1/CDK,
shGFP, and shRB cells due to increased p21 protein levels after
Nutlin-3 treatment. Next, we examined the growth of HCT116 cells
expressing shGFP, shp53, shRB, or D1/CDK on tissue culture plates
and in soft agar following treatment with 3 and 9 Amol/L of
Nutlin-3 (Fig. 5B). In agreement with the HME1 results, treatment
with Nutlin-3 inhibited the growth of all HCT116 derivatives except
for those expressing shRNA to p53. Strikingly, <5% of all HCT116
cells formed colonies when p53 was expressed, even in the presence
of D1/CDK or the absence of RB (Fig. 5C; Supplemental Fig. S4).

We describe here the transformation of immortalized HME1
cells by a cyclin D1–CDK fusion protein that models the cyclin D1
overexpression commonly observed in cancer. The transformed
phenotype conferred by D1/CDK expression was observed whether
or not p53 was inactivated, consistent with the idea that
constitutive CDK activity prevents p53-mediated growth suppression by disrupting the p53-p21-RB–mediated repression of genes
necessary for cell cycle progression. Although the activity of p53
was insufficient to inhibit anchorage-independent growth, treatment of the D1/CDK-expressing cells with the HDM2 antagonist
Nutlin-3 led to a p53-dependent arrest despite the persistent
hyperphosphorylation of RB. The growth suppression could be
explained by the repression of CDC2 and cyclin B1.
The RB-independent repression of CDC2 and cyclin B1 is
consistent with a recent report demonstrating that the p53dependent decrease in CDC2 levels was due to the direct
interaction between p53 and the CDC2 promoter recruitment of
DNA methyltransferase 1, which led to promoter methylation
and silencing (24). A similar DNA methyltransferase 1–dependent
repression was recently reported for the CDC25C and SURVIVIN
genes (24, 25). The fact that CDC2 expression remained repressed

Figure 5. HCT116 cells respond to Nutlin-3 in a similar manner as HME1 cells.
A, shGFP, shRB, shp53, control, and D1/CDK HCT116 cells were treated
with 3 and 9 Amol/L of Nutlin-3 for 24 h and then analyzed by the Western
method. B, cells treated with 3 or 9 Amol/L of Nutlin-3 for 24 h were re-fed with
fresh media for 6 d before being stained with methylene blue. The stain
was extracted and quantified. C, cells were grown in soft agar and treated with

even after Nutlin-3 was removed and p53 levels decreased, suggests
that the repression of CDC2 may be mediated by a stable,
epigenetic event consistent with methylation. It would explain why
cells with D1/CDK retaining wild-type p53 were unable to resume
cell division even after the removal of Nutlin-3, when the level of
phosphorylated RB increases. The inability of the cells to
demethylate and de-repress specific genes would prevent the
expression of specific components that are necessary for cellular
division. In contrast to cells having downstream disruptions in the
p53 signaling pathway, cells expressing HdmX (which we and
others have previously shown to confer resistance to Nutlin-3 or
shRNA directed at p53) are unable to induce the p53-mediated
repression of this cohort of genes either directly, or by a RB-E2F–
dependent mechanism. As a result, these cells show no change in
the status of phosphorylated RB or CDC2 expression, and do not
arrest appropriately in response to Nutlin-3.
Transformation of normal human cells is far more complicated
than that of normal rodent cells (26). Thus, we were surprised
to see that D1/CDK expression alone was sufficient to promote
anchorage-independent growth in human mammary epithelial
cells. The HME1 cells used in our studies are derived from a

reduction mammoplasty and are post-selection, meaning that
they have spontaneously hypermethylated the p16Ink4a promoter
and do not express p16INK4a protein. In addition, they were
immortalized by the expression of exogenous hTERT. Extensive
passaging of these cells led to the current HME1 population, which
were at passage 140 or greater in the experiments described here.
It should be stressed that these cells have probably acquired
additional changes during their growth, including increased levels
of c-MYC, as described by Zhao et al. (15). Although HME1 cells
show no signs of transformation in the absence of additional
genetic changes, we now know that the expression of D1/CDK in
pre-selection HMECs, with or without shp53, is unable to promote
anchorage-independent growth (data not shown). However, these
pre-selection cells lack hTERT expression, have normal levels of
p16Ink4a, and express low levels of MYC, which may account for
at least a part of the difference. The unknown epigenetic changes
in the HME1 cells used here probably cooperate with D1/CDK
expression to permit transformation, even though the expression
of shp53 and PI3K, alone or together, was unable to transform
these cells.
The response of cells transformed by specific genetic elements to
specific therapies may provide important information regarding
the likelihood that a therapy will be successful. p53-dependent
signaling typically results in apoptosis or cell cycle arrest (27). In
some cases, the growth arrest may be reversible, so that after the
stimulus inducing arrest is removed, the cells can reenter the cell
cycle and continue to proliferate. Even though the p53-responsive
genes that regulate cell cycle arrest, such as p21, 14-3-3j, Reprimo,
Gadd45, and B99 have been well studied, how they are repressed
and de-repressed after removal of a stress stimulus needs further
examination.
In conclusion, we have shown that immortalized mammary
epithelial cells are transformed by constitutively activated CDK,
where RB activity has been repressed. However, additional p53dependent mechanisms for growth suppression remain because
p53 activated by Nutlin-3 is still functional. Although the levels of
hyperphosphorylated RB remained high in D1/CDK cells compared
with control cells, the levels of CDC2 were reduced similarly,
arguing that a direct mechanism for p53-dependent repression of
gene expression exists and can override the effect of deregulated
E2F. Other studies indicate that Nutlin-3 can induce growth arrest
and apoptosis in some acute myeloid leukemia cell lines and
primary multiple myelomas, but is unable to affect cells transformed by HdmX. Continued focus on the sensitivity or resistance
of cells transformed by specific alterations, such as the effectiveness of Nutlin-3 in cells transformed by constitutive cyclin D1,
will provide important information regarding the practical use of
this promising new therapeutic agent (9, 28). Additional studies
into the p53-dependent, RB-independent pathway for inducing
cellular arrest may also aid us in better understanding how cells are
able to undergo growth arrest after a stressful event and whether
such events lead to temporary or permanent cellular arrest.
Furthering our knowledge of the obstacles that a cell needs to
overcome in order to become tumorigenic can suggest new
pathways and proteins to target for therapeutic treatment.
