BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate preoperative treatment with full-dose gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and radiation therapy (RT) in patients with localized pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Eligibility included confirmation of adenocarcinoma, resectable or borderline resectable disease, a performance status 2, and adequate organ function. Treatment consisted of two 28-day
cycles of gemcitabine (1 g/m2 over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15) and oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15) with RT during cycle
1 (30 Gray [Gy] in 2-Gy fractions). Patients were evaluated for surgery after cycle 2. Patients who underwent resection received 2
cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy. RESULTS: Sixty-eight evaluable patients received treatment at 4 centers. By central radiology
review, 23 patients had resectable disease, 39 patients had borderline resectable disease, and 6 patients had unresectable disease.
Sixty-six patients (97%) completed cycle 1 with RT, and 61 patients (90%) completed cycle 2. Grade 3 adverse events during preoperative therapy included neutropenia (32%), thrombocytopenia (25%), and biliary obstruction/cholangitis (14%). Forty-three patients
underwent resection (63%), and complete (R0) resection was achieved in 36 of those 43 patients (84%). The median overall survival
was 18.2 months (95% confidence interval, 13-26.9 months) for all patients, 27.1 months (95% confidence interval, 21.2-47.1 months) for
those who underwent resection, and 10.9 months (95% confidence interval, 6.1-12.6 months) for those who did not undergo resection.
A decrease in CA 19-9 level after neoadjuvant therapy was associated with R0 resection (P 5.02), which resulted in a median survival
of 34.6 months (95% confidence interval, 20.3-47.1 months). Fourteen patients (21%) are alive and disease free at a median follow-up
of 31.4 months (range, 24-47.6 months). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative therapy with full-dose gemcitabine, oxaliplatin, and RT was feasible and resulted in a high percentage of R0 resections. The current results are particularly encouraging, because the majority of

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic carcinoma is associated with a poor prognosis in all stages.1 In patients who present with resectable disease, surgery offers the potential for a cure, and postoperative therapy provides benefit.1-4 Unfortunately, the majority of patients
with localized pancreatic cancer present with borderline resectable or unresectable disease, and initial surgical therapy is
unlikely to result in a complete (R0) resection.1,5,6
In contrast to surgery first, preoperative therapy offers advantages for patients who have localized pancreatic cancer.
Patients can receive systemic therapy sooner, generally with better tolerance and compliance. Preoperative treatment

appears to increase the rate of margin negative resections
in borderline lesions.7,8 Furthermore, recognition of metastatic disease during preoperative therapy spares patients
major surgery. Finally, isolated local progression during
preoperative therapy, precluding resection, appears to be
uncommon, as reported in 2 sequential studies involving
176 patients.9,10
We previously conducted a phase 1 study of oxaliplatin added to full-dose gemcitabine and radiation in
patients with pancreas cancer.11 This approach is
intended to maximize systemic therapy while simultaneously enhancing the effects of radiation.12-15 On the basis
of safety and encouraging results in patients with resectable disease, here, we report a multi-institution phase 2
study of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and
adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resectable and
borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients who had pathologically confirmed pancreatic carcinoma and localized disease were eligible for this study.
Resectability was assessed by multidetector (computed tomography [CT]) scan using a multiphase, contrastenhanced technique and applying 2008 National Comprehensive Cancer Center Network criteria (version 1).
Briefly, tumors were designated as resectable with a clear
fat plane around the celiac and superior mesenteric
arteries and patent superior mesenteric and portal veins.
Patients were deemed borderline resectable if they had
severe unilateral superior mesenteric vein or portal vein
impingement, tumor abutment of the superior mesenteric
artery, gastroduodenal artery encasement up to the origin
from the hepatic artery, or colon invasion. Further eligibility criteria included a life expectancy >12 weeks; a
Zubrod performance status 2; and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. Patients with grade 2
neuropathy, those who had received prior therapy for pancreatic cancer, and those who had received prior abdominal radiation were not eligible. The institutional review
board of each participating institution approved the trial.
Written informed consent was obtained from all patients
before treatment initiation. This clinical trial is registered
with clinicaltrials.gov (registration no. NCT00456599).
Treatment

Protocol treatment consisted of four 28-day cycles of chemotherapy: 2 cycles before surgery and 2 cycles after. Gemcitabine (1 g/m2 infused over 30 minutes) was administered
on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle; oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2
infused over 90 minutes) was administered on days 1 and

15. Radiation therapy was delivered concurrently with the
first cycle of chemotherapy in 2-Gray [Gy] fractions (total
dose, 30 Gy). Three-dimensional planning was used, limiting the target volumes to gross disease with a 1-cm margin
and allowing no elective lymph node irradiation, as
described previously.11 Treatment plans were reviewed and
approved by a central radiation oncologist (E.B.-J.) before
the initiation of treatment.
Patients were evaluated after the second cycle of
chemotherapy; and, if they had no evidence of metastasis or local progression that precluded resection,
then surgery was offered 2 to 4 weeks after the last
chemotherapy cycle. After resection, patients received
adjuvant chemotherapy, which resumed within 12
weeks of surgery.
Adjustments to chemotherapy doses were based on
the toxicity experienced during previous therapy and on
the platelet and absolute neutrophil (ANC) counts on the
day of treatment. For an ANC 1000/mm3 and platelets
75,000/mm3, patients received full doses. For an ANC
>500/mm3 and <1000/mm3 and/or platelets >50,000/
mm3 and <75,000/mm3, patients received a 50% reduction in the gemcitabine dose and a 25% reduction in the
oxaliplatin dose. For an ANC 500/mm3 or platelets
50,000/mm3, chemotherapy was held until the patient
recovered to an ANC 1000/mm3 and a platelet count
75,000/mm3. Both agents were held for any nonhematologic toxicities grade 3, and treatment resumed upon
improvement to grade 2. If chemotherapy was held,
then, when resumed, doses of both agents were reduced
by 25%. If a hold occurred during cycle 1, then radiation
treatment also was held. Beyond cycle 1, if chemotherapy
was held, then that treatment day was dropped. If toxicity
and recovery were not sufficient to allow treatment
resumption within 3 weeks, then patients were taken off
protocol.
Assessment of Response and Surgical
Therapy

Interpretation of baseline CT scans and imaging studies
after preoperative therapy and decision making regarding
surgery were undertaken at the institutional level. A
blinded post hoc central review of baseline and presurgical
CT scans was performed upon completion of the study by
a single radiologist (I.R.F.). For this report, that central
review determined resectability status and response after
neoadjuvant therapy according to Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).16
For all patients who underwent surgery, the details
collected included the type and duration of surgery,

vascular resection and/or reconstruction; the estimated
blood loss; the length of hospitalization; and data on readmission or reoperation within 30 days. A blinded central
pathology review of all resection specimens was performed
by a single pathologist (J.K.G.) and included assessment
of tumor size, grade, margin status, lymph node number
and involvement, and histologic evaluation of response to
treatment.17 Quality-of-life measurements were assessed
before, during, and after therapy and will be subject of a
separate report.
Statistical Analysis

This trial was designed to demonstrate an improvement in
2 year disease-free survival (DFS). We hypothesized that the
treatment regimen would increase DFS by at least 15 percentage points based on an estimate of 35% derived from
resected patients who received postoperative adjuvant gemcitabine on the CONKO-001 trial.3 For the current trial,
68 patients were required to provide 80% statistical power
using a 1-sided test. Secondary endpoints included the rate
of successful resection and survival. When designing the
trial, we assumed that approximately 70% of those enrolled
would be resectable at entry and that most would undergo
successful resection (R0). However, the proportion of
accrued patients who had borderline resectable disease was
significantly higher than anticipated (approximately 70% vs
30%). The trial continued with additional emphasis placed
on determining the rate of R0 resection and clinical outcomes in the study population.
The ability to achieve an R0 resection and tumor
response (complete plus partial responses) was tested for
significant associations with patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics using chi-square and t test statistics
for categorical and continuous data, respectively. The
characteristics considered were patient age at study entry,
race, sex, performance status, baseline overall quality of
life, baseline assessment of resectability, the presence of
vessel contact (none, artery, and/or vein), tumor site in
the pancreas (head, body, or tail), tumor size before and
after neoadjuvant treatment and RECIST response, the
pretreatment carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) level
(a serum tumor marker; also called sialylated Lewis a antigen) and change after therapy, and histologic response to
neoadjuvant treatment. Clinical outcome was defined as
overall survival (OS) and DFS. The times to events were
calculated from the first day of treatment to the date of
death (OS) or the date of progression or death (DFS).
Patients who did not experience the events of interest were
censored on their last contact date. Time-to-event endpoints were summarized using the product-limit method

explain OS was constructed using the proportional hazards model, simultaneously modeling the covariates that
were associated significantly with survival in univariate
analysis. The best model was chosen by iteratively removing nonsignificant covariates until only significant
(P < .05) covariates remained. P values  .05 were considered significant for all test statistics.
RESULTS
Patient and Primary Tumor Characteristics

Seventy-five patients were consented and registered on the
study between July 2007 and February 2010. One patient
was ineligible because of a diagnosis of neuroendocrine
cancer, and 3 patients who did not receive any study treatment were not considered in further analyses. Seventy-one
eligible patients were evaluable for safety. Of these, 1

Treatment

Sixty-six patients (97%) completed cycle 1 of chemotherapy and radiation (30 Gy), with 19 patients (29%) requiring a delay (generally 1 week). Sixty-one patients (90%)
initiated a second cycle of chemotherapy. After cycle 2, 4
patients were judged inoperable because of medical conditions, and 8 patients progressed (12%) either locally
(n 5 4) or distantly (n 5 4), precluding resection (Fig. 1).
Eight additional patients were removed from protocol to
continue chemotherapy as opposed to proceeding to surgery. Six of those patients subsequently underwent surgical exploration, as described below.
Forty-eight patients (71%) underwent laparotomy
according to the protocol (and 6 additional patients underwent delayed surgery). In total, 43 patients underwent resection (including 5 off protocol), leading to a resection rate of

Of 41 patients who underwent R0/R1 resection, 22
patients developed recurrent disease at a median time after
surgery of 10.4 months (range, 2.3-35.8 months). Recurrent disease was local only in 7 patients (17%), distant
only in 10 patients (24%), and both local and distant in 5
patients (12%). Five additional patients died without documentation of their pattern of recurrence at a median
time from surgery to death of 6.9 months (range, 1.810.1 months). The 2-year DFS estimate was 26.1% (95%
CI, 16.1%-37.4%). Fourteen patients (21%) remained
alive and disease-free at a median follow-up of 31.4
months (range, 24-47.6 months).
Patient, tumor, and response characteristics were
evaluated for significant univariate associations with
achieving R0 resection, survival time, and time to disease
progression. None of the characteristics (listed above; see
Statistical Analysis) were associated significantly with R0
resection with the exception of CA 19-9 response.

Comparing any increase (n 5 15) with a 0% to 50%
decrease (n 5 13) and a >50% decrease (n 5 27) demonstrated that a decrease in CA 19-9 was associated with R0
resection (P 5 .02). Resection (R0 vs R1/R2 vs none),
baseline quality of life, female gender, tumor in the pancreatic body or tail (compared with the pancreatic head),
and lower CA 19-9 levels at baseline (continuous) were
associated with improved survival (all P < .05). In the
patients who underwent surgical resection (n 5 43), longer surgery time (P 5 .03) and increased blood loss during
surgery (P 5 .02) were associated with poorer survival,
and marginal associations were observed with surgical
procedure (Whipple was inferior to distal-subtotal pancreatectomy; P 5 .057) and histologic treatment effect
(P 5 .068). None of the characteristics had an association
with the time to progression.
The best multivariable model to explain OS in 68
evaluable patients from the covariates available is presented in Table 4. Incomplete resection (R1/R2) and the
inability to undergo resection were associated significantly
with reduced survival along with male gender and having
a tumor located in the pancreatic head.
DISCUSSION
This multi-institutional trial is a continuation of a series
of studies at the University of Michigan that have used
full-dose gemcitabine with conformal radiation limited to
gross tumor in patients with localized pancreatic cancer.11,13,18-20 The central tenet of this approach is that
standard (full) doses of chemotherapy will maximize systemic disease control while simultaneously sensitizing the
primary tumor to concurrent radiation.12-15 This is in
contrast to other gemcitabine/radiation combinations in
which patients receive gemcitabine at lower doses (weekly,
400-600 mg/m2; biweekly, 40 mg/m2) and radiation
2698

includes clinically uninvolved lymph nodes.9,10,21,22 In
the current study, despite the addition of oxaliplatin at a
standard dose, treatment was well tolerated with rates of
hospitalization and nonhematologic grade 3 and 4 toxicities similar to, or lower than, previous studies.9,10,19
Although the primary study endpoint of demonstrating
an improvement in 2-year DFS was not achieved, principally because the majority of entered patients had borderline resectable disease, evidence of efficacy was noted.
This therapy resulted in an R0 resection in 84% of
patients who underwent surgery, with a resultant median
survival of 34.6 months, which is notable in the context
that 70% of resections were performed in borderline resectable (28 patients) or unresectable (2 patients) disease.
Lymph nodes were involved in 49% of the resections,
comparing favorably to a resectable patient population
(72% in CONKO-001 and 66% in Radiation Therapy
Oncology Group trial 97-04).3,4 This result, along with
the significant association of CA 19-9 response and R0
resection, suggests a treatment effect from preoperative
therapy. For those patients who achieve any resection, a
median survival of 27.1 months is similar to the median
survival reported in the adjuvant phase 3 trials.2-4 Appreciating that preoperative treatment is commonly offered
to patients who have locally advanced disease, there is little prospective data for comparison with our trial, especially in patients who have borderline resectable
disease.19,23-25
A persistent challenge to the development and evaluation of preoperative therapies for pancreatic cancer is
accurate staging. Despite undergoing evaluations in academic medical centers with multidisciplinary pancreatic
cancer programs, a post hoc central review of all CT scans
in our study led to the recategorization of resectability status in a number of patients in both directions: 9 patients
moved from borderline to resectable status, and 14
patients were upstaged, 8 from resectable to borderline
status and 6 to unresectable status. This challenge of accurate staging is also reflected in changing definitions, which
occurred during the conduct of this trial. The current definition of resectability is based on a consensus statement
that was published in 2009.26 Although we applied the
2008 definition throughout this report, using 2009 criteria to categorize our 68 evaluable patients, the number of
resectable patients would decrease from 23 to 12, with 10
patients upstaged to borderline status and 1 patient
moved to unresectable status.
The optimal time for surgery after neoadjuvant therapy is also difficult to define. The tumor may not regress
on CT imaging despite clinical and CA 19-9

response.27,28 Eight patients were removed from our protocol because of vascular involvement to receive additional
chemotherapy before surgery, and 5 of those patients subsequently underwent R0 resection. The observation that
others in the trial with an increase in tumor longest diameter 20% (n 5 5) or with continuing contact on vessels
after 2 cycles of treatment (n 5 21) underwent R0 resections points to the difficulty in determining when surgery
should be offered.
Several aspects of this report bear comment. The
2008 National Comprehensive Cancer Center Network
resectability criteria used were inadequate; although they
clearly defined resectable tumors, they did not easily distinguish between borderline and unresectable disease,
especially for tumors outside the pancreatic head. The
patient population was heterogeneous, and the likelihood
of resectablilty at baseline varied by tumor location within
the pancreas and by the presence and degree of contact
with vein(s) and/or arteries. The treatment protocol was
intended for resectable patients according to the study
design/endpoints and the duration/intensity of preoperative therapy, yet eligibility criteria allowed us to accrue
patients with more advanced disease. Finally, the utility of
combination chemotherapy used here is uncertain. The
regimen was based on meta-analyses that reported a survival benefit from gemcitabine-platin combinations in
advanced disease, and it may be supported by recent data
with the oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFIRINOX) combination.29,30 Our study, however, was not designed to determine the contribution of
oxaliplatin to gemcitabine-based treatment.
Weaknesses of the current study include difficulties
in the accurate characterization of resectability, the entry
of patients with unresectable disease, the removal of
patients from protocol to continue chemotherapy before
surgery, and the lower numbers of patients who received
adjuvant treatment. Strengths of this study include the
multi-institutional setting, the number of patients entered
(especially those with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer), and the central review of imaging, radiation treatment plan, and pathology on resected specimens. This is
one of the first prospective studies to establish what may
be expected using the current definitions of resectability
with regard to R0 resection rates and overall outcomes.
In summary, we report on a group of 68 patients
with localized pancreatic cancer who, according to 2009
definitions, had resectable (n 5 12), borderline resectable
(n 5 49), or unresectable (n 5 7) pancreatic cancer.26 After 2 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin plus radiation during cycle 1, the

majority of patients went on to undergo R0 surgical resection. The median survival for the entire population was
18.2 months, and, for those who achieved R0 resection, it
was 34.6 months. On the basis of this experience, the
study treatment can be recommended for patients with resectable or borderline resectable disease. For those who
have more advanced disease, longer or more intensive
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy using higher
doses should be further investigated.31-33
