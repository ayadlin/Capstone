Abstract
Overexpression of the antiviral DNA cytosine deaminase
APOBEC3B has been linked to somatic mutagenesis in
many cancers. Human papillomavirus infection accounts for
APOBEC3B upregulation in cervical and head/neck cancers,
but the mechanisms underlying nonviral malignancies are
unclear. In this study, we investigated the signal transduction
pathways responsible for APOBEC3B upregulation. Activation
of protein kinase C (PKC) by the diacylglycerol mimic phorbolmyristic acid resulted in speciﬁc and dose-responsive increases
in APOBEC3B expression and activity, which could then

be strongly suppressed by PKC or NF-kB inhibition. PKC
activation caused the recruitment of RELB, but not RELA, to
the APOBEC3B promoter, implicating noncanonical NF-kB
signaling. Notably, PKC was required for APOBEC3B upregulation in cancer cell lines derived from multiple tumor types. By
revealing how APOBEC3B is upregulated in many cancers, our
ﬁndings suggest that PKC and NF-kB inhibitors may be repositioned to suppress cancer mutagenesis, dampen tumor evolution,
and decrease the probability of adverse outcomes, such as drug
resistance and metastasis. Cancer Res; 75(21); 4538–47. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

mutational events are dispersed throughout the genome, but an
interesting minority is found in strand-coordinated clusters
termed kataegis (2, 12).
Expression proﬁling and functional studies independently
discovered APOBEC as a major source of mutation in cancer
(6, 8). Human cells have the potential to express up to seven
distinct antiviral APOBEC3 enzymes (13). APOBEC3B is the only
family member clearly upregulated in breast and ovarian cancer
cell lines and primary tumors (6, 8). APOBEC3B is predominantly
nuclear, and knockdown experiments demonstrated that it
accounts for all measurable DNA cytosine deaminase activity in
cancer cell line extracts and, likewise, is also responsible for
elevated levels of genomic uracil and higher mutation rates
(6, 8). In addition, APOBEC3B levels correlated with higher Cto-T and overall base substitution mutation loads. Importantly,
the biochemical preference of recombinant APOBEC3B deduced
in vitro closely resembles the actual cytosine mutation bias in
breast cancer as well as in several of the other tumor types listed
above (i.e., strong bias toward 50 -TC dinucleotides; refs. 6–10).
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection was recently shown to
induce APOBEC3B expression in cell culture experiments, which
helps explain APOBEC3B upregulation and mutation biases in
virus-positive cervical and head/neck tumors (14, 15). However,
the mechanism responsible for APOBEC3B upregulation in other
tumor types (i.e., non-HPV cancers) is presently unknown, but
not due to obvious processes such as chromosomal translocation,
gene ampliﬁcation, or promoter demethylation (6). Here, we
show that the protein kinase C (PKC)/NF-kB pathway speciﬁcally
induces APOBEC3B expression, providing the ﬁrst mechanistic
link between a major signal transduction pathway and cancer
mutagenesis. Multiple experimental approaches combined to
demonstrate direct transcriptional upregulation of APOBEC3B
by a signal transduction pathway involving the classical PKC
isoform PKCa and the noncanonical NF-kB transcription factor

Somatic mutations are essential for nearly every hallmark of
cancer (1). Mutations occur when DNA damage escapes repair.
Cancer genome deep sequencing studies are conﬁrming previously known sources of mutation as well as helping to discover
new ones (2–4). Established sources of mutation include UV light
in skin cancer, tobacco carcinogens in lung cancer, and hydrolytic
deamination of methyl-cytosine as a function of age in nearly all
cancers. One newly discovered source is the plant-derived dietary
supplement aristolochic acid, which causes A-to-T transversion
mutations in liver and bladder cancers (5). A second and larger
source of mutation is the APOBEC family of DNA cytosine
deaminases, which cause signature C-to-T transition and C-toG transversion mutations in breast, head/neck, bladder, cervical,
lung, and ovarian cancers (2–4, 6–11). The majority of these

APOBEC3B Upregulation by PKC/NF-kB

RELB. PKC inhibition also leads to APOBEC3B downregulation in
several cancer cell lines, suggesting that existing compounds may
be repurposed to control mutagenesis in cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Cell line information is given in Supplementary Table S1.
qRT-PCR
RNA was extracted from healthy cells using the High Pure
RNA Isolation Kit (Roche), and triplicate cDNA reactions were
made using Transcriptor RT (Roche). qPCR was performed
using primer-probe combinations for each APOBEC (16).
The primers for PKCa were 50 -TGGTTTTGGTTCCCATTTCT and
50 -CATCCGGGTTTCCTGATTC and the probe was Roche UPL 1.
The primers for TNFa were 50 -CAGCCTCTTCTCCTTCCTGAT
and 50 -GCCAGAGGGCTGATTAGAGA, and the probe was Roche
UPL 29.
Immunoblotting
The development of the rabbit mAb against APOBEC3B will be
described elsewhere (W.L. Brown and colleagues; unpublished
data). The mAb used here is 10-87-13, and it recognizes endogenous APOBEC3B in a variety of assays, including immunoblotting, as demonstrated in several experiments. This mAb crossreacts with APOBEC3A and APOBEC3G but these proteins can be
easily distinguished by faster and slower SDS-PAGE migration
differences, respectively (e.g., Fig. 4). The anti-tubulin (Covance,
MMS-407R) and anti-PKCa (Cell Signaling Technology, 2056P)
antibodies were used according to company speciﬁcations.
Deaminase activity assays
ssDNA cytosine deaminase activity assays were performed as
reported (14). A total of 4 pmol 50 -ATTATTATTATTCAAATGGATTTATTTATTTATTTATTTATTT-ﬂuorescein was treated with
cell extract containing 0.025 U/rxn UDG (New England BioLabs),
UDG buffer, and 1.75 U/rxn RNase A (Qiagen) for 2 hours. Abasic
sites were cleaved by treatment with 100 mmol/L NaOH at 95 C
for 10 minutes. Substrate was separated from the product using
15% TBE-urea gel electrophoresis. Gels were analyzed using a
FujiFilm Image Reader FLA-7000.
Phorbol-myristic acid induction and PKC/NF-kB inhibitors
A total of 2.5  105 cells were plated in a 6-well plate 1 day
prior to drug treatment. Phorbol-myristic acid (PMA) was then
added to the media and incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2 for 6
hours unless otherwise indicated. For experiments utilizing
inhibitors, cells were pretreated with inhibitors 30 minutes
prior to PMA induction (25 ng/mL). PMA (Fisher Scientiﬁc),
cyclohexamide (Acros Organics), G€
o6983 (Cayman Chemical),
LY294002 (EMD Chemicals), UO126 (EMD Chemicals), bisindolylmaleimide-1 (BIM-1; Cayman Chemical), G€
o6976 (Enzo
Life Sciences), AEB071 (Medchem Express), BAY 11-7082 (R&D
Systems), MG132 (Fisher Scientiﬁc), and TPCA-1 (Cayman
Chemical) were stored as recommended.
PKC knockdowns
pLKO.1-based lentiviruses were produced in 293T cells as
reported (6). MCF10A cells were transduced with PKCa
#1 (Open Biosystems, TRCN0000001691), PKCa #2 (Open

www.aacrjournals.org

Biosystems, TRCN0000001692), PKCa #3 (Open Biosystems,
TRCN0000001690), or a control lentivirus. Ninety-six hours
later the transduced pools were treated with 25 ng/mL PMA for
3 (RNA) or 6 (protein) hours and then harvested and analyzed
as described above.
RNA sequencing
Parallel sets of MCF10A cells were treated every 8 hours with
media supplemented with PMA or DMSO for 48 hours. RNA was
extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA was
submitted to the University of Minnesota Genomics Center for
sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Raw reads were
analyzed using both DESeq2 (17) and the Tuxedo suite (18) to
identify changes in mRNA expression in PMA treated versus
untreated cells.
Chromatin immunoprecipitations
MCF10A cells were treated with either DMSO or 25 ng/mL PMA
for 2 hours. Cross-linking was performed with 1% formaldehyde
for 10 minutes at room temperature and quenched with 150
mmol/L glycine. Cells were then lysed in Farnham Lysis Buffer at
4 C for 30 minutes. Nuclei were pelleted, resuspended in RIPA
Buffer, and sonicated (Diagenode Pico Sonicator) to generate
approximately 600-bp DNA fragments. Immunoprecipitations
were done using Protein G Dynabeads (Invitrogen) and 2 mg
antibody per sample. Samples were washed in 1 mL low salt wash
buffer, 1 mL high salt wash buffer, 1 mL LiCl wash buffer, and
eluted at 65 C for 30 minutes. Samples were reverse cross-linked
using 200 mmol/L NaCl and treated with Proteinase K for 12
hours at 65 C. DNA was puriﬁed using a ChIP DNA Clean and
Concentrator Kit (Zymo Research) and qPCR was performed with
SYBR Green master mix (Roche) on a Roche LightCycler 480.
Values represent the percentage of input DNA immunoprecipitated (IP DNA) and are the average of three independent biologic
replicates. All chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) reagents
are listed in Supplementary Table S2.

Results
Speciﬁc upregulation of APOBEC3B by PMA
The ﬁrst cDNAs representing APOBEC3A and/or APOBEC3B
were cloned from PMA-treated primary human keratinocytes
(19). PMA is a diacylglycerol (DAG) analogue known to trigger
PKC signaling as well as activate a number of other cellular
processes (20–23). Due to high levels of homology between
APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B (92%), including stretches of perfect
identity, it is not clear which gene may have been represented by
these original cDNAs. Moreover, the primary tissues used in this
study consisted of multiple epithelial cell types and most likely
also inﬁltrating immune cells making it unclear where the cDNAs
may have originated. These distinctions are important given the
fact that APOBEC3A (not APOBEC3B) is upregulated >100-fold
by IFNa treatment of myeloid cell types (24, 25), and that
APOBEC3B (not APOBEC3A) is upregulated by HPV infection
of keratinocytes (14, 15).
To resolve these issues and get a molecular handle on APOBEC3B transcriptional regulation, a panel of cell lines was treated
with PMA or equal amounts of DMSO as a negative control, and
the mRNA levels of all 11 human APOBEC family members were
quantiﬁed by qRT-PCR (16). APOBEC3B mRNA was induced at
least 2-fold in all lines by PMA treatment (except 293T), with the

greatest magnitude occurring in the immortalized normal breast
epithelial cell line MCF10A (Supplementary Fig. S1). Under
standard cell culture conditions MCF10A expresses low levels of
APOBEC3B and APOBEC3F, even lower levels of APOBEC3G and
APOBEC3H, high levels of APOBEC3C, and undetectable levels of
all other APOBEC family members. PMA treatment caused a
speciﬁc 100-fold upregulation of APOBEC3B mRNA, with no
detectable changes in the expression levels of any other APOBEC
family members (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S2).
APOBEC3B was induced with as little as 1 ng/mL PMA, and its
induction was dose responsive and near maximal at 25 ng/mL
PMA (Fig. 1B, histogram). APOBEC3B mRNA levels correlated

with a rise in steady-state protein levels as measured by immunoblotting (Fig. 1B, immunoblot) and enzymatic activity as
measured by a gel-based ssDNA cytosine deamination assay
(Fig. 1B, polyacrylamide gel). Moreover, signiﬁcant APOBEC3B
mRNA induction was detected 30 minutes after PMA treatment
and maximal levels were observed 3 hours after treatment
(Fig. 1C, histogram). APOBEC3B protein and activity levels lagged
shortly behind mRNA levels and persisted throughout the duration of the 6-hour time course (Fig. 1C, immunoblot and
polyacrylamide gel). An extended time course revealed that
APOBEC3B mRNA levels begin to decrease by 12 hours and
return to near basal levels by 24 hours after PMA treatment

APOBEC3B Upregulation by PKC/NF-kB

(Supplementary Fig. S3). Importantly, APOBEC3B upregulation is likely to be a direct result of signal transduction as the
kinetics of mRNA upregulation were not affected by simultaneously treating cells with the protein translation inhibitor
cyclohexamide (Fig. 1D). Cycloheximide treatment was effective as evidenced by disrupted APOBEC3B protein accumulation. Altogether, these data demonstrate that APOBEC3B is
strongly and speciﬁcally upregulated by a PMA-induced signal
transduction mechanism in multiple cell lines and most strongly in the immortalized normal breast epithelial cell line
MCF10A. Notably, APOBEC3B upregulation can be as high as
100-fold and this mRNA level is on par with those observed in
many different cancer cell lines and tumor types, including a
large fraction of breast and ovarian cancers (i.e., mRNA levels 2to 5-fold higher than those of the housekeeping gene TBP;
refs. 6–8, 14).
PKC is required for APOBEC3B induction by PMA
PMA is a known agonist of PKC signaling, but is also capable of
affecting other cellular processes (20–23). To determine whether
APOBEC3B induction by PMA occurs through PKC signal transduction or an alternative mechanism, MCF10A cells were pretreated for 30 minutes with varying concentrations of the panPKC inhibitor G€
o6983 (26) and then incubated for 6 hours with
an optimal amount of PMA (25 ng/mL). In comparison to strong
APOBEC3B upregulation observed with PMA treatment alone,
pretreatment with G€
o6983 caused a dose-responsive suppression
of APOBEC3B induction (Fig. 2A). APOBEC3B was suppressed to
background levels by as little as 5 mmol/L G€
o6983 (Fig. 2A).
Moreover, no morphologic defects or viability issues were
observed at these concentrations of G€
o6983 (Supplementary Fig.
S4). As additional controls, MCF10A cells were pretreated in
parallel with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the MEK inhibitor
UO126 prior to PMA induction (Fig. 2B and C). In both instances,
APOBEC3B was still induced fully by PMA.
Human cells can express up to nine different PKC genes
(20, 21, 23). The resulting PKC proteins (conventionally called
isoforms) are divisible into three classes based primarily on
activation mechanism: classical PKC (cPKC) isoforms require
both DAG and increased levels of intracellular calcium, novel
PKC (nPKC) isoforms require only DAG, and atypical PKC
(aPKC) isoforms are activated by other signals. To test which
class of PKC isoforms is responsible for APOBEC3B upregulation, we utilized two additional inhibitors known to have
potency similar to G€
o6983, but greater selectivity for certain
PKC classes. First, we pretreated MCF10A cells with BIM-1,
which is known to inhibit both the cPKC and nPKC classes
(27), and then induced with optimal PMA concentrations. A
nearly identical dose-dependent suppression of APOBEC3B
induction was observed (Fig. 2D). This result was expected, as
DAG mimics do not generally activate aPKCs. Second, we
pretreated MCF10A cells with G€
o6976, which is an inhibitor
of cPKC proteins (28). The dose responsiveness of APOBEC3B
repression was again similar to G€
o6983 (Fig. 2E). Taken
together, these chemical inhibition data strongly implicated
a cPKC isoform in APOBEC3B induction by PMA.
One of the most potent and clinically advanced PKC inhibitors
is AEB071, which selectively inhibits cPKC and nPKC isoforms
(29, 30). AEB071 has shown results in preclinical studies and
phase I clinical trials for treatment of uveal melanoma (31–34).
To fortify the pharmacologic approaches elaborated above, we

www.aacrjournals.org

asked whether pretreatment of MCF10A cells with AEB071 would
produce a similar reductive effect on PMA-induced APOBEC3B
expression as the above PKC inhibitors. Indeed, a clear dosedependent response was observed and, importantly, AEB071
caused a complete suppression of APOBEC3B expression at
500 nmol/L, which is approximately 10-fold more potent than
G€
o6983, BIM-1, or G€
o6976, consistent with reported lower IC50
values for this molecule (Fig. 2F; refs. 26–29, 35).
RNAseq data revealed that PKCa (PRKCA) is the only cPKC
isoform expressed in MCF10A cells (Fig. 2G). PKCa mRNA levels
were unchanged by PMA treatment consistent with a mechanism
by which PMA signals through preexisting PKCa to ultimately
stimulate APOBEC3B transcription (Fig. 2G). To further test the
involvement of PKCa in this regulatory pathway, we depleted
PKCa expression using three independent shRNA-encoding lentiviral constructs. In each case, PKCa knockdown resulted in a
corresponding reduction in the level of APOBEC3B mRNA
induced by PMA (Fig. 2H). Immunoblots conﬁrmed PKCa knockdown and proportional reductions in APOBEC3B (Fig. 2I). Altogether, the pharmacologic and genetic approaches provide a
strong case for PKCa as the predominant PKC isoform driving
PMA-mediated upregulation of APOBEC3B.
NF-kB is required for APOBEC3B induction by PMA
We next asked which downstream transcription factor is
responsible for driving APOBEC3B upregulation in response to
PMA. PKC is known to signal through several different transcription factors, including ERK, JNK, NF-kB, and others (20, 21, 23).
We therefore started at the DNA level and examined the APOBEC3B promoter region for binding sites of known PKC-regulated
transcription factors. Interestingly, these in silico analyses revealed
several NF-kB binding sites within 2.5 kb of the APOBEC3B
transcriptional start site (50 -GGRRNNYYCC). NF-kB is known to
have multiple roles in immunity and inﬂammation (36), and a
direct NF-kB-mediated relay to APOBEC3B expression could be
physiologically beneﬁcial, given APOBEC3B's known roles in
innate immunity.
To test for a mechanistic link between NF-kB and APOBEC3B
transcription, we used two compounds known to block NF-kB
signaling through independent mechanisms. First, we treated
MCF10A cells with varying amounts of BAY 11-7082, which is
an NF-kB inhibitor that acts by inhibiting upstream ubiquitin
assembly (37). This small molecule caused strong dose-responsive drops in APOBEC3B induction by PMA treatment (Fig. 3A).
Second, we pretreated the MCF10A cells with a titration of the
proteasome inhibitor, MG132, prior to PMA stimulation. It is well
known that both the canonical and noncanonical NF-kB signaling
pathways require proteasome-mediated degradation of IkB and
processing of p100, respectively, for efﬁcient signal transduction
and that MG132 blocks these events (36). Consistent with this
mechanism of action, MG132 treatment caused a dose-dependent
decrease in APOBEC3B expression (Fig. 3B). As above, neither
BAY 11-7082 nor MG132 caused cell cycle or morphologic
changes throughout the durations of these experiments (Supplementary Fig. S4).
RNAseq data revealed that MCF10A expresses both the
canonical NF-kB components, RELA and NFKB1, and the noncanonical NF-kB components, RELB and NFKB2, and levels of
these mRNAs are unaffected by PMA treatment (Fig. 3C).
Canonical signaling is known to require IKKb, whereas noncanonical NF-kB signaling is strictly dependent on IKKa-catalyzed

pathways, we used TPCA-1, which is known to have a 22-fold
selectivity for IKKb (canonical) over IKKa (noncanonical;

TPCA-1 concentrations spanning the IC50 values of both proteins, and then PMA was used to induce APOBEC3B upregulation. APOBEC3B expression was inhibited closer to the reported

4542 Cancer Res; 75(21) November 1, 2015

IC50 of IKKa, consistent with involvement of the noncanonical
NF-kB pathway (Fig. 3D). As an additional control, we also
analyzed TNFa, which is regulated by the canonical pathway
(39, 40). As expected, TNFa expression was inhibited by much
lower concentrations of TCPA-1 conﬁrming the differential selectively of this compound and further implicating the noncanonical
NF-kB pathway (Fig. 3D).

Noncanonical NF-kB signaling is responsible for APOBEC3B upregulation by PMA. A and B, histograms depicting the dose-responsive inhibition of PMA-induced APOBEC3B
upregulation by BAY 11-7082 (ubiquitination inhibitor) and MG132 (proteasome inhibitor). MCF10A cells were treated with PMA following a 30-minute pretreatment
with the indicated concentrations of each inhibitor. APOBEC3B mRNA expression is reported as the mean of three independent qRT-PCR reactions normalized to TBP (error
bars report SD from triplicate assays). C, histogram depicting NF-kB subunit mRNA levels in MCF10A cells treated with PMA or vehicle control. Expression was determined by
RNA-seq and is reported as per million fragments mapped (FKPM) and normalized to TBP. D, plot depicting inhibition of PMA-induced APOBEC3B expression by the IkB
kinase (IKK) inhibitor, TPCA-1, near the IC50 for IKKa, not IKKb. The MCF10A cells were treated with PMA following treatment with varying concentrations of TPCA-1. TNFa
(blue) and APOBEC3B (red) mRNA levels are reported as the mean of three independent qRT-PCR reactions normalized to TBP (error bars report SD from triplicate assays).
The dotted lines denote previously reported in vitro IC50 values for IKKa and IKKb inhibition by TPCA-1 (38). E, histogram showing the kinetics of NFKBIA upregulation PMA.
MCF10A cells were treated with PMA for the indicated times and mRNA values were quantiﬁed as in A. F, APOBEC3B and NFKBIA promoter regions contain several putative
NF-kB binding sites (TSS, transcriptional start site). G, RELB and p100/p52 are speciﬁcally and robustly recruited to the APOBEC3B promoter region by PMA.
ChIP was performed after a treatment with PMA or vehicle control for 2 hours. APOBEC3B sites 4 and 5 and the two NFKBIA sites are reported together because they were
too close to each other to be distinguished by this procedure. qPCR results are reported as a percentage of the total chromatin input.

The PKC pathway drives endogenous APOBEC3B expression in cancer cells. A, APOBEC3B mRNA levels in representative breast, ovarian, bladder, and head/neck
cancer cell lines. mRNA expression is reported as the mean of three independent qRT-PCR reactions normalized to TBP (error bars report SD from triplicate
assays). B, AEB071 downregulates APOBEC3B in multiple cancer cell lines. The histogram reports APOBEC3B mRNA levels normalized to the vehicle-treated control
for each line. The dotted line represents a 50% decrease of APOBEC3B expression due to AEB071. The corresponding immunoblots show APOBEC3B and
TUBULIN levels. Each line was treated with AEB071 (10 mmol/L) or vehicle control for 48 hours prior to mRNA and protein analysis.

RELB and p100/p52 are recruited to the APOBEC3B promoter
region in response to PMA
We next performed ChIP experiments to further test whether
the noncanonical NF-kB pathway is responsible for upregulating
APOBEC3B. Primer sets were designed for each of the predicted
NF-kB binding sites near the APOBEC3B transcriptional start site
(Fig. 3F). As a control, an additional primer set was made for the
promoter region of NFKBIA, which contains NF-kB binding sites
and is also upregulated by the PMA with similar kinetics as
APOBEC3B (NFKBIA encodes IkB; Fig. 3E and F). ChIP was
performed for RELA, RELB, p100/p52, RNA POL II (positive
control), and isotype-matched IgG (negative control). As
expected, RELA, RELB, p100/p52, and RNA POL II were all bound
to the NFKBIA promoter following PMA treatment (Fig. 3G). We
also found RNA POL II bound to the APOBEC3B gene near the
transcriptional start site and throughout the gene body in
response to PMA (Fig. 3G). Interestingly, both RELB and p100/

4544 Cancer Res; 75(21) November 1, 2015

p52 were recruited to the same sites as RNA POL II following PMA
treatment, indicating that these factors are also involved in driving
APOBEC3B expression in response to PMA (Fig. 3G). An expanded ChIP experiment replicated these data and showed that RNA
POL II, RELB, and p100/p52 binding are dependent on PKC
signaling as treatment with AEB071 completely ablated all binding to the APOBEC3B promoter (Supplementary Fig. S5). These
ChIP data strongly implicate the noncanonical NF-kB pathway,
speciﬁcally the RELB and p100/p52 heterodimer (and not RELA
and p105/p50), in directly inducing APOBEC3B transcription in
response to PMA activation of PKC.
Endogenous APOBEC3B expression requires PKC in multiple

We next asked whether the constitutively high levels of endogenous APOBEC3B observed in many human cancer cell lines
occurs through the PKC pathway (6, 8, 14). For this series of

experiments, we selected 4 breast, 4 ovarian, 4 bladder, and 4
head/neck cancer cell lines expressing a 10-fold range of endogenous APOBEC3B mRNA levels (Fig. 4A). Each line was treated for
48 hours with 10 mmol/L AEB071, the most potent PKC inhibitor
identiﬁed above, and then APOBEC3B mRNA and protein levels
were quantiﬁed by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting. As above, no
effects on the cell cycle or cell viability were observed (Supplementary Fig. S6). This is important because higher concentrations
of AEB071 are known to cause cell-cycle perturbations and
apoptosis in certain cell types (31–33). APOBEC3B mRNA levels
were reduced by more than half in 7/16 cell lines, including the
breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-453, and
HCC1806, the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR5, and the head/
neck lines SQ-20B, JSQ3, and TR146 (Fig. 4B, histogram).
Changes of protein levels largely mirrored the mRNA results (Fig.
4B, immunoblot). Interestingly, several cell lines, including all of
the bladder cancer cell lines, showed little decrease in APOBEC3B
expression upon treatment with AEB071, suggesting that at least
one additional induction mechanism exists. Altogether, these
data demonstrate that the PKC axis is responsible for the constitutive upregulation of endogenous APOBEC3B in a variety of
cancer cell lines representing multiple distinct cancer types.

Discussion
These studies are the ﬁrst to establish mechanistic linkages
between the PKC/NF-kB signal transduction pathway and upregulation of the DNA mutating enzyme APOBEC3B in cancer. Our
studies suggest a model in which PKCa activation signals through
the noncanonical NF-kB pathway and results in the recruitment of
RELB to the APOBEC3B gene and its transcriptional activation
(Fig. 5). This mechanism is remarkably speciﬁc to APOBEC3B, as
expression of the related APOBEC family members is not affected.
This speciﬁcity is concordant with our prior studies indicating that
APOBEC3B is the only DNA deaminase family member upregulated in these and other cancer types in comparison to normal
tissues (6–8, 14). Moreover, PKC inhibitor studies with breast,
head/neck, bladder, and ovarian cancer cell lines demonstrate that
the PKC/NF-kB pathway contributes to the constitutively high

www.aacrjournals.org

levels of endogenous APOBEC3B associated with cancer mutagenesis. Additional studies will be needed to determine the precise
proportions of each tumor type affected by this APOBEC3B
upregulation mechanism that, based on prior studies from our
laboratory and others, is expected to endow cancer cells with
mutational fuel for accelerated tumor evolution.
A recent publication implicated both the interferon response
and the canonical and noncanonical NF-kB pathways in APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B upregulation and clearance of HBV episomes from infected cells (41). Activation of the lymphotoxin-b
receptor through treatment of infected hepatocytes with bivalent
or tetravalent antibodies led to the nuclear translocation of both
RELA and RELB and the activation of known NF-kB pathway
genes. These antibody treatments also led to the upregulation of
APOBEC3A and/or APOBEC3B and to the gratuitous deamination
of HBV cccDNA cytosines, viral DNA degradation, and long-term
virus suppression. Taken together with our results presented here,
it is tempting to speculate that both the PKC and the lymphotoxinb receptor signaling mechanisms converge upon the noncanonical RELB-dependent NF-kB pathway in order to activate APOBEC3B expression. Thus, our work suggests additional strategies
such as PMA treatment to induce APOBEC3B upregulation and
clearance of HBV from infected hepatocytes. However, these
strategies may induce collateral damage through genomic DNA
mutagenesis and should be approached carefully.
Clear evidence for APOBEC3B overexpression and mutation
signatures in cervical and head/neck cancers suggested that HPV
infection might trigger an innate immune response that includes
DNA deaminase upregulation (7, 9). Subsequent work demonstrated that infection by high-risk (not low-risk) HPV types causes
the speciﬁc upregulation of APOBEC3B, suggesting that this is not
simply a gratuitous response to viral infection (14, 15). Moreover,
the E6 oncoprotein alone from high-risk types was sufﬁcient to
trigger APOBEC3B upregulation (14). It is notable that the overall
fold induction by HPV is lower than that described here, due
partly to higher background and partly to a smaller magnitude of
induction. The mutator phenotype induced by HPV infection is
likely fueling tumor evolution as the pattern of PI3K-activating
mutations in HPV-positive tumors is biased toward cytosine

mutations in APOBEC-like motifs in the helical domain of the
kinase, whereas the pattern in HPV-negative tumors is split
between the helical and kinase domains of the enzyme
(10, 11). Obviously, HPV-mediated upregulation of APOBEC3B
only impacts cervical cancers and a proportion of head/neck and
bladder carcinomas. In contrast, a larger number of tumor types is
likely to be using the mechanism described here.
It will also be interesting to determine the relationship between
APOBEC3B upregulation and immunotherapy responsiveness, as
recent reports have suggested that increased tumor mutation
loads correlate with stronger anticancer immune responses
(42, 43). It may therefore be useful to induce APOBEC3B, as
described here, to increase tumor neoantigens in order to boost
efﬁcacies of current immunotherapies.
Although PKC mutations are rare in cancer, altered expression
of several PKC isoforms is observed and associated with poor
clinical outcomes (20, 21). In addition, mutations in GNAQ and
GNA11 occur in approximately half of all uveal melanoma
samples [(44, 45); illustrated as Gq in Fig. 5]. Inhibition of PKC
in these uveal tumors leads to clinical beneﬁts attributed to cellcycle arrest and apoptosis (31–34). It is possible that downregulation of APOBEC3B and a subsequent decrease in tumor
evolution through lowered mutation rates may also contribute to
these encouraging clinical responses. Based on substantive prior
work from our lab and others demonstrating a major role for
APOBEC3B in cancer mutagenesis and correlating high levels of
APOBEC3B with poor prognoses for ER-positive breast cancers
(46, 47), together with the studies presented here, we propose that
existing inhibitors of the PKC/NF-kB axis such as AEB071 may be
repurposed to treat primary tumors in combination with existing
therapies and help prevent detrimental outcomes such as drug
resistance and metastases.
