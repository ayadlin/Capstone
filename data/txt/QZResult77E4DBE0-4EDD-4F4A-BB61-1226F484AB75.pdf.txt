ABSTRACT
Although circulating tumor cell (CTC) enumeration in peripheral blood has already
been validated as a reliable biomarker in predicting prognosis in metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), patients with favorable CTC counts (CTC < 5/7.5
ml) still experience various survival times. Assays that can reduce patients’ risks
are urgently needed. In this study, we set up a real-time quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method to detect epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
and stem cell gene expression status in peripheral blood to validate whether they
could complement CTC enumeration. From January 2013 to June 2014 we collected
peripheral blood from 70 mCRPC patients and enumerated CTC in these blood samples
using CellSearch system. At the same time, stem cell-related genes (ABCG2, PROM1
and PSCA) and EMT-related genes (TWIST1 and vimentin) were detected in these
peripheral blood samples using an RT-qPCR assay. Patient overall survival (OS) and
treatment methods were recorded in the follow-up. For patients who received firstline chemotherapy, docetaxel plus prednisone, PSA progression-free survival (PSAPFS) and PSA response rate were recorded. At the time of analysis, 35 patients
had died of prostate cancer with a median follow-up of 16.0 months. Unfavorable
CTC enumerations (CTC ≥5/7.5 ml) were predictive of shorter OS (p = 0.01). Also,
positive stem cell gene expression indicated poor prognosis in mCRPC patients (p
= 0.01). However, EMT gene expression status failed to show any prognostic value
in OS (p = 0.78). A multivariate analysis indicated that serum albumin (p = 0.04),
ECOG performance status (p < 0.01), CTC enumeration (p = 0.02) and stem cell gene
expression status (p = 0.01) were independent prognostic factors for OS. For the 40
patients categorized into the favorable CTC enumeration group, positive stem cell
gene expression also suggested poor prognosis (p < 0.01). A combined prognostic
model consisting of stem cell gene expression and CTC enumeration increased the
concordance probability estimated value from 0.716 to 0.889 in comparison with CTC
enumeration alone. For patients who received docetaxel plus prednisone as firstline chemotherapy, positive stem cell gene expression suggested a poor PSA-PFS
(p = 0.01) and a low PSA response rate (p = 0.008). However, CTC enumeration
and EMT gene expression status did not affect PSA-PFS or PSA response rates. As

CTC enumeration in predicting OS and docetaxel-based treatment effects in mCRPC
patients.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

In the past several years, great progress has been
made in the management of metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer (mCRPC). Several novel therapeutic
agents including abiraterone, enzalutamide, cabazitaxel
and radium-223 have demonstrated their life-prolonging
efficacy in the treatment of mCRPC. However, the
development of personalized and sequential management
strategies has been hindered by the inability to identify
distinct prognostic subgroups. Prostate-specific antigen
(PSA), a commonly used prostate-specific biomarker, is
not a reliable surrogate for survival end points because
of insufficient sensitivity and specificity, and reliable
prognostic and predictive biomarkers are urgently needed.
Recently, analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
was shown to be of prognostic and predictive value in
mCRPC [1-3]. Most of these studies used the CellSearch
(Janssen Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ, USA) system for CTC
analysis and found a consistent result, namely that an
unfavorable CTC count (≥5 cells/7.5 mL) before therapy
was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) than
a favorable CTC count ( < 5 cells/7.5 mL) in mCRPC
patients [1, 2, 4]. Although CellSearch is the only US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared device
for CTC detection and enumeration, it still has some
limitations including a comparatively low detection rate
and uncertainty of reliable finding in favorable counts. In
this regard, although the survival times of patients with
high CTC counts are uniformly poor, survival times for
those with low CTC counts vary widely [5, 6]. These
limitations may be due to the inability of the CellSearch
system to detect CTCs that have undergone epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), which results in lost
expression of epithelial cell markers and re-expression of
stem cell markers.
Therefore, we established a set of sensitive, highly
reproducible, and fully standardized real-time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays to detect
stem cell markers (ABCG2, PROM1 and PSCA) and
EMT markers (TWIST1 and vimentin) in peripheral blood
samples derived from mCRPC patients, and we further
evaluated whether these markers could complement
CellSearch CTC enumeration in predicting prognosis and
treatment effect in mCRPC patients.

Patient characteristics
The clinicopathologic characteristics of our 70
mCRPC patients are summarized in Table 1. The median
age was 70 years and the median PSA was 24.2 ng/ml at
the time of inclusion. The site of metastasis included: bone
(92.9%), lymph node (34.3%), liver (7.1%), lung (5.7%)
and other soft tissue (7.1%). In all, 22 patients developed
multi-organ metastasis at the time of the blood draw. After
a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 12–26 months),
35 patients died of prostate cancer.

Detection of stem cell gene and EMT gene
expression using RT-qPCR
Relative gene expression (RGE) was calculated
using the 2-ΔΔCt method (ΔΔCt = (Ct gene – Ct β-actin)
patient sample − (Ct gene – Ct β-actin) healthy volunteer
sample) [7, 8]. Baseline gene expression was precisely
quantitated in 20 healthy male control subjects (Table
2). The median RGE for ABCG2, PROM1, TWIST1
and vimentin in mCRPC patients was 0.88, 1.38, 0.88
and 0.92, respectively. The cut-off RGE value was set at
1.78, 2.15, 1.89 and 2.75 for ABCG2, PROM1, TWIST1
and vimentin, respectively. As PSCA was not detected in
healthy control subjects, PSCA was defined as positive if
it could be detected within 40 cycles in RT-qPCR. The
detection rate of ABCG2, PROM1, TWIST1, vimentin
and PSCA in mCRPC patients is listed in Table 2. In
total, 44.29% (31/70) of patients were stem cell gene
expression positive as at least one of the three genes
(ABCG2, PROM1 and/or PSCA) could be detected, and
47.14% (33/70) of patients were positive for EMT gene
expression as at least one of the two markers (TWIST1
and/or vimentin) could be detected.

Prognostic value of stem cell, EMT gene
expression status and CTC enumeration
Unfavorable CTC enumeration was detected (≥5
CTCs in 7.5 mL PB) in 30 patients (42.86%). Univariate
analysis found that CTC enumeration and stem cell
gene expression status were strong prognostic factors
for OS (Table 3, Figures 1 and 2). However, EMT gene
expression status had no prognostic value (Table 3, Figure

Combined prognostic model

Response
to
chemotherapy

We developed a prognostic model using the
combination of stem cell gene expression and CTC
enumeration. In this model, the unfavorable group was
defined as patients with either positive stem cell gene
expression or unfavorable CTC enumeration (CTC ≥5),
and the favorable group was defined as patients with
both negative stem cell gene expression and favorable
CTC enumeration. The statistical analysis showed a
better concordance probability estimate (CPE) (0.889) in
the combined prognostic model than CPE (0.716) in the
model using CTC enumeration alone (Figure 5).

docetaxel-based

first-line

For the 30 patients who underwent docetaxelbased first-line chemotherapy, the PSA response rate
and PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS) were
evaluated. Patients with stem cell gene expression had
a lower PSA response rate (25.0%, 3/12) compared
with patients without stem cell gene expression (77.8%,
14/18; p = 0.008) (Table 4). Neither CTC enumeration
nor EMT gene expression status showed any predictive
value in determining PSA response rates (Table 4). PSAPFS was shorter among patients with stem cell gene
expression (p = 0.01, 2.67 vs. 6.50 months, Figure 6).
However, CTC enumeration (p = 0.52) and EMT gene

genes including Snail, Twist, and Zeb [14]. In addition,
the process can trigger differentiated cells to acquire
a multipotent cancer stem cell-like phenotype. This
may mirror developmentally regulated EMT signaling
pathways such as Wnt, Notch and Hedgehog, which drive
cancer stem cell renewal and maintenance [15, 16].
Since most CTC detection methods rely on the
capture of cells with antibodies specifically against
the epithelial phenotype-specific markers EpCAM and
cytokeratins, they may lead to relatively low detection
rates. In our study, although the selected EMT markers
did not show any prognostic value in predicting OS and
response status to chemotherapy, stem cell gene expression
status has proved to be a strong prognostic factor for
OS. We also found an increased predictive power when
combining CTC counts and stem cell gene expression
status to discriminate the favorable from the unfavorable
group with respect to OS.
In this study, we validated that detection of stem
cell gene expression in peripheral blood can be predictive
of the response status of docetaxel-based first-line
chemotherapy for 30 mCRPC patients. Docetaxel at 75
mg/m2 once every 3 weeks with prednisone compared with
mitoxantrone plus prednisone has been shown to confer
a significant survival advantage in patients with mCRPC
[17]. In China, docetaxel treatment has been established
as standard chemotherapy for mCRPC patients. However,
definitive prognostic factors at the initiation of docetaxel
chemotherapy associated with disease progression and OS
have not been identified.
PSA is not adequate to reflect the status of disease
effectively. In 20% of mCRPC patients who finally
respond to chemotherapy proven to prolong OS, an initial
PSA increase is seen before the decline. The decline may
not occur for up to 12 weeks or even longer [18-20].
Recently, the androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7)
detected in CTCs from mCRPC patients was found to be
a reliable marker associated with primary resistance to
enzalutamide and abiraterone therapy. However, in followup studies, detection of AR-V7 in CTCs from mCRPC
patients was proven to be unassociated with primary
resistance to taxane chemotherapy [21].
The mechanisms of cancer stem cells in
chemoresistance have long been investigated [22].
ABCG2, a member of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters, is closely related to multi-drug resistance
by reducing cytoplasmic chemotherapeutic drug
concentrations [23]. Sanchez et al. proved that the
pharmacological blockade and knockdown of ABC
transporters could partially sensitize prostate cancer cells
to chemotherapy [24]. Prominin-1, also known as CD133,
has been well documented to be a putative cancer stem
cell surface marker in a number of tumors including
prostate cancer [25]. Richardson et al. found that in
primary prostate cancer tissues, CD133+ cells exhibited
characteristics of cancer stem cells including tumorsphere

expression status (p = 0.43) did not show any prognostic
value in PSA-PFS (Figures 7 and 8). For the remaining
40 patients who did not receive docetaxel-based first-line
chemotherapy, neither stem cell gene expression status nor
CTC enumeration nor EMT gene expression status had
prognostic value.

DISCUSSION
In this prospective study, we set up a highly
sensitive RT-qPCR-based assay to detect stem cell gene
and EMT gene expression in CTCs derived from mCRPC
patients. This offers ease of collection and minimal onsite
processing. More importantly, we found that both CTC
enumeration and stem cell gene expression status were
independent prognostic factors for OS in our mCRPC
patients (Table 3, Figures 1 and 2). However, EMT
gene expression status had no prognostic value (Figure
3). In addition, among the 40 patients with favorable
CTC enumeration, those with positive stem cell gene
expression experienced significantly shorter OS (Figure
4). Therefore, we established a prognostic model to predict
the prognosis of CRPC patients by measuring the CPE
using the combination of stem cell gene expression and
CTC enumeration, which had a markedly improved risk
assessment as shown in the combined prognostic model,
which increased the CPE value from 0.716 to 0.889.
It is not surprising that CTC enumeration served as
an independent prognostic factor for OS in our 70 mCRPC
patients. The prognostic value of CTC enumeration using
the CellSearch system in mCRPC patients has been
reported previously. Goldkorn et al. reported that baseline
high CTC counts enumerated using the CellSearch before
therapy were associated with shorter median survival than
low CTC counts in mCRPC patients treated with docetaxel
[1]. Scher et al. also found that a biomarker panel
containing the CTC number and LDH level was shown to
be a surrogate for survival in mCRPC patients treated with
abiraterone [2]. Interestingly, we also discovered that not
all the patients in the favorable CTC group experienced a
good prognosis, especially for the stem cell gene-positive
ones. Because enumerating CTCs using the CellSearch
system relies on the expression of epithelial markers, we
may not be able to detect CTCs if they have undergone
intrinsic modifications of their phenotype and lost their
epithelial characteristics.
A critical concept that has emerged to explain the
result is EMT. It enables epithelial cells to lose their
apical–basal polarity, detach from neighboring cells,
invade through the surrounding stroma, and become more
resistant to apoptosis [9]. During this process, tumor cells
lose expression of specific epithelial markers including
E-cadherin [10], EpCAM [11], and cytokeratin [12],
and gain expression of mesenchymal cytoskeletal and
adhesion proteins such as vimentin and N-cadherin [13].
These proteins are thought to be controlled by a family of

formation and the development of prostatic-like acini in
SCID mice. [26]. Yang et al. also found that the CD133+
population of the C4-2B prostate cancer cell line was
closely associated with docetaxel-based chemotherapy
[27].
PSCA has been shown to be overexpressed in
local as well as metastatic prostate cancer cells [28,
29]. Its expression level increases in cases of higher
Gleason score, advanced tumor stage and progression of
disease to an androgen-independent state [30, 31]. In our
study, the detection of stem cell gene expression in the
peripheral blood of mCRPC patients was associated with
chemoresistance. This result suggested that these markers
might act as therapeutic targets in the further treatment of
prostate cancer.
The relatively small cohort size was one of the
limitations of the current study. A validation cohort will
be needed in any future study. Another limitation is
that only 30 patients actually received docetaxel-based
chemotherapy among the 70 patients recruited in this
study. Although abiraterone, enzalutamide and cabazitaxel
have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of
mCRPC, they have not yet been marketed in China. As a
result, patients in our cohort did not receive any of these
new therapeutic agents during follow-up treatment, which
probably contributed to the relatively short OS.
In summary, our study proved that the ABCG2,
PROM1 and PSCA-based stem cell gene expression
status could be used as a complement to CellSearch to
predict OS. Furthermore, detection of these stem cell
genes implicated the emergence of primary resistance
to docetaxel-based first-line chemotherapy in mCRPC
patients. Studies with larger cohorts will be needed to
validate our preliminary findings.

clinical laboratory tests, measurement of serum PSA
and testosterone levels, thoracic, abdominal and pelvic
computed tomography (CT) scans, and a whole-body bone
scan. Peripheral blood from each patient was collected
after inclusion and before initiation of subsequent
therapy. Because the China Food and Drug Administration
(CFDA) have not approved abiraterone, enzalutamide
and cabazitaxel, 30 of our 70 patients were treated with
docetaxel plus prednisone as their first-line therapeutic
regimen, and the remaining 40 patients who were
intolerant to or refused chemotherapy were treated with
ketoconazole, estrogen or traditional Chinese medicine.
All patients were closely followed after inclusion. During
follow-up, PSA levels were measured once a month
in each patient to evaluate the PSA response, best PSA
response, and PSA-PFS. According to the PCWG2
criteria, a PSA response referred to a ≥50% decline in PSA
levels from baseline and maintained for ≥4 weeks; a best
PSA response referred to the maximal percentage decrease
in PSA levels from baseline; and PSA progression referred
to an increase in PSA levels of 25% or more above the
nadir (and by ≥2 ng/ml), with confirmation ≥4 weeks later
[32, 33].
To define baseline expression in peripheral blood of
the multiple mRNA markers used in this study, peripheral
blood from control subjects was collected. We included
20 healthy male volunteers (aged 35–72 years, with no
evidence of malignancy) as control subjects. This study
was carried out in accordance with the ethical standards
of the Helsinki Declaration II and approved by the Ethics
and Scientific Committee of our institution. Written
informed consent was obtained from all patients and
healthy volunteers before any study-specific investigation
was carried out.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Blood sample collection
To reduce blood contamination by epithelial cells
from the skin, the first 2 ml of blood was discarded and
the collection tube was disconnected before withdrawing
the needle at the end of the procedure. From each patient
and healthy volunteer, 17.5 ml of peripheral blood was
collected. The first 7.5 ml of blood was stored in a
CellSave tube for CTC isolation and enumeration using
the CellSearchTM system (Veridex LLC, Warren, NJ,
USA). The remaining 10 ml of blood was stored in an
EDTA tube and immediately (within 2 hours) transferred
to the laboratory and processed using Ficoll density
gradient centrifugation (Ficoll-Paque Plus, TBDscience,
China) to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs). The separated PBMCs, which contained CTCs,
were stored at -80°C until RNA extraction.

Prostate cancer cell line
LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium
(GIBCO, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS, GIBCO) at 37°C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere incubator.

Patient selection and characteristics
From January 2013 to June 2014, 70 consecutive
mCRPC patients (aged 55–85 years) treated at Fudan
University Shanghai Cancer Center were included in

Enumeration of CTCs using the CellSearchTM
system

Statistical analysis
OS and PSA-PFS were calculated using the
Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test to assess
differences between groups. Univariate and multivariate
analyses of prognostic factors were conducted using the
Cox proportional hazards model. Because of the limited
number of patients, only the variables that appeared to
have a significant impact on OS by univariate analysis
were included in the multivariate analysis. To evaluate the
PSA response rate according to CTC enumeration, stem
cell and EMT gene expression status, Fisher’s exact test
was used.
Prognostic significance of CTC enumeration and
the combined prognostic model were assessed using
the concordance probability estimate (CPE). The CPE
measures the level of concordance between the survival
time and the prognostic index, based on the linear
combination of covariates in the Cox model, to provide
an unbiased assessment of discrimination with survival
data [6, 34]. CPE values range from 0.5–1.0, with 1.0
representing perfect concordance between the prognostic
index and survival time [6, 34]. All statistical tests were
done using SPSS, version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) and R statistics package, version 2.8.1 (http://
www.r-project.org/). A P-value < 0.05 was considered to
indicate statistical significance.

Isolation and enumeration of CTCs were performed
at the central laboratory of our institution using the
FDA-approved CellSearchTM system. The process has
been previously described in detail [3, 34]. Unfavorable
CTC enumeration was defined as ≥5 CTCs in 7.5 ml of
peripheral blood [3, 34].

RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was extracted from the separated PBMCs
from 70 mCRPC patients and 20 healthy male volunteers
using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA). RNA
samples extracted from LNCaP cells served as a positive
control. All RNA preparation and handling procedures
were performed under RNase-free conditions in a laminar
flow hood. Optical density measurements at 260 and 280
nm were used to quantify and assess the purity of the
RNA. Reverse transcription of RNA was carried out with
the PrimeScript RT Master Mix system (TaKaRa, Dalian,
China). Complementary DNA was synthesized from 2 µg
of total RNA isolated from PBMCs in a total volume of 20
µl, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cancer stem cell gene and EMT gene expression
analysis using RT-qPCR

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This study was supported by a grant from the
Guide Project of Science and Technology Commission of
Shanghai Municipality (124119a7300), and a grant from
the Outstanding Young Talent Training Plan of Shanghai
Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning
(XYQ2013102).

RT-qPCR was performed using the 7900HT Fast
RT-PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The β-actin
gene was used to normalize gene expression levels.
Probes including ABCG2 (catalog no. Hs01053790_m1),
PROM1 (catalog no. Hs01009250_m1), PSCA (catalog
no. Hs04177224_g1), TWIST1 (catalog no. Hs01675818_
s1), vimentin (catalog no. Hs00185584_m1) and β-actin
(catalog no. Hs01060665_m1) were purchased from ABI
Applied Biosystems. Relative gene expression (RGE)
was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method (ΔΔCt = (Ct gene
– Ct β-actin) patient sample − (Ct gene – Ct β-actin)
healthy volunteer sample) [7, 8]. RT-qPCR positivity
was defined as gene expression greater than the cut-off
threshold, which was set for each gene marker at three
standard deviations above the mean expression in healthy
control blood samples [8]. Stem cell gene expression was
classified as positive if expression of one of the three stem
cell genes (ABCG2, PROM1, and PSCA) was detected
and EMT gene expression was classified as positive if
expression of one of the two EMT genes (TWIST1 and
vimentin) was detected.
