Abstract
MLN4924 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) in phase I clinical
trials. NAE inhibition prevents the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of substrates for cullin-RING
ubiquitin E3 ligases that support cancer pathophysiology, but the genetic determinants conferring sensitivity to NAE
inhibition are unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a genome-wide siRNA screen to identify
genes and pathways that affect the lethality of MLN4924 in melanoma cells. Of the 154 genes identiﬁed,
approximately one-half interfered with components of the cell cycle, apoptotic machinery, ubiquitin system, and
DNA damage response pathways. In particular, genes involved in DNA replication, p53, BRCA1/BRCA2, transcription-coupled repair, and base excision repair seemed to be important for MLN4924 lethality. In contrast, genes within
the G2–M checkpoint affected sensitivity to MLN4924 in colon cancer cells. Cell-cycle analysis in melanoma cells by
ﬂow cytometry following RNAi-mediated silencing showed that MLN4924 prevented the transition of cells from S–
G2 phase after induction of rereplication stress. Our analysis suggested an important role for the p21-dependent
intra-S-phase checkpoint and extensive rereplication, whereas the ATR-dependent intra-S-phase checkpoint
seemed to play a less dominant role. Unexpectedly, induction of the p21-dependent intra-S-phase checkpoint
seemed to be independent of both Cdt1 stabilization and ATR signaling. Collectively, these data enhance our
understanding of the mechanisms by which inhibition of NEDD8-dependent ubiquitination causes cell death,
informing clinical development of MLN4924. Cancer Res; 73(1); 225–34. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
MLN4924 is an investigational small-molecule inhibitor of
the NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE; ref. 1). MLN4924 has
shown antitumor activity in multiple xenograft models of
human cancer at well-tolerated doses (1–3). MLN4924 is
currently being explored in phase I clinical trials, where some
clinical activity has been observed in solid tumor and hematologic malignancies (4). Therefore, a more complete understanding of the impact of NAE inhibition on cancer cell biology
is warranted.
NAE catalyzes the activation and transfer of NEDD8 onto
Ubc12 and Nce2 in an ATP-dependent manner (5). Activated
NEDD8 is then transferred onto 1 of 8 cullins in a DCN1dependent manner (6, 7). Neddylation of the cullins results

in the activation of the class of E3 ubiquitin ligases known as
the cullin-RING ligases (CRL). These enzymes conjugate
proteins with Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains (8, 9) thereby promoting the degradation of a relatively small subset
of proteasomal substrates (1). CRLs have been shown to
monoubiquitinate some proteins, especially histones (9).
Recently, the function of Cul1-Rbx1-Skp1 (CRL1) has been
expanded to include Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chain formation (10).
Initial studies to deﬁne the mechanism of action of
MLN4924 have shown that blocking of CRL1-Skp2 and Cul4Rbx1-Ddb1 (CRL4)-Cdt2 function results in Cdt1 stabilization,
which leads to DNA rereplication and accumulation of cells in
S-phase, thereby promoting cell death in most cancer cell lines
studied (1, 11, 12), although stabilization of IkB via inhibition of
CRL1-bTRCP plays a role in some settings (2).
To prevent genomic instability, initiation of DNA replication is tightly controlled by a well orchestrated process that
involves the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1,
geminin, the Mcm2–7 complex, Mcm10, Cdc45, and the GINS
complex (13–17). Following DNA replication initiated by the
protein kinases Cdk2 and Dbf4-Cdc7, Cdt1 is degraded,
whereas Cdc6 is exported from the nucleus, thereby preventing reﬁring of the origin. Degradation of Cdt1 is controlled in
a Cdk2-dependent manner by CRL1-Skp2 and in a PCNAdependent manner by CRL4-Cdt2 (18–21). Cdt2 is also known
as denticleless (DTL).

DNA rereplication results from the multiple reﬁring of the
origins of replication during DNA synthesis, generally resulting
in partial polyploidy (16). Overexpression of CDT1 or CDC6 or
depletion of GMNN, encoding an inhibitor of Cdt1, can induce
DNA rereplication in some tumor cell lines, although checkpoint control is activated in normal cells and in other tumor
cell lines (22, 23).
Several studies have shown that cullin-dependent ubiquitination along with the COP9 signalosome, which is responsible
for deneddylation of the cullins, have additional roles in DNA
damage response pathways. These include global genome and
transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, histone modiﬁcation, and regulation of checkpoints via degradation of p21,
p27, p53, Cdc25A, Wee1, claspin, and Fanconi anemia, complementation group M (FANCM) (9, 24–27). Therefore, it is
likely that inhibition of NAE by MLN4924 impacts multiple
DNA damage response pathways beyond those involving Cdt1
stabilization.
Therefore, to ascertain the relative importance of these
potentially diverse mechanisms, we have conducted a
genome-wide siRNA screen to evaluate the genetics of sensitivity to MLN4924 in the A375 human melanoma-derived cell
line. RNA interference (RNAi) screens provide an important
avenue for understanding the sensitivity of tumor cells to drugs
and drug candidates (28–30).
This screen identiﬁed 154 genes whose knockdown had
signiﬁcant effects on MLN4924-induced cell death. Collectively, the data suggest that NAE inhibition by MLN4924 primarily
causes cell death by dysregulating components of the cell cycle,
apoptotic machinery, the ubiquitin system, and the DNA
damage response, including the p53 pathway, BRCA1/BRCA2
complex, transcription-coupled, and base excision repair. In
particular, we show that activation of the p53 pathway is
independent of Cdt1 stabilization and ATR activation, showing
that MLN4924 affects cell survival by the stabilization of
proteins beyond Cdt1.

Materials and Methods
Additional experimental details are contained within the
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Genomic characterization and authentication of cell
lines
A375 and HCT-116 were received from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) in July 2006 and June 2009,
respectively, and passaged twice before freezing. Genomic
DNA was isolated from 2 million cells under vendor-speciﬁed protocols. Five-hundred micrograms of DNA per sample was then ampliﬁed, labeled, and processed on the
Affymetrix SNP-6 whole genome array platform on August
22, 2011 and evaluated using Partek Genomics Suite for copy
number variation analysis. Spearman correlation was determined for each cell line against an ATCC-authenticated
stock vial received at Millennium (A375 ATCC CRL-1619
and HCT-116 ATCC CCL-247). Consistent regions of ampliﬁcation and deletions were found between the cell lines of
the same origin and correlation on genotypes were greater

226

Cancer Res; 73(1) January 1, 2013

than 0.995. Cell lines were passaged for fewer than 8 weeks
following resuscitation.
Genome-wide screen and hit deconvolution
A375 melanoma cells (300 cells/well) were reverse transfected in duplicate on 384-well poly-D-lysine (PDL)-coated
black, clear bottom plates (CELLCOAT, Greiner) using 15
nmol/L siRNA oligos (siGENOME SMARTpool, Dharmacon)
and 28 nL/well DharmaFECT 4 reagent (DH4, Dharmacon) in
64 mL Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). After 48 hours of knockdown, cells were treated with 0, 250, or 650 nmol/L MLN4924,
in the continued presence of siRNA oligos, and incubated for a
further 48 hours, after which viability was assessed with
ATPlite reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Perkin-Elmer). Luminescence was measured using a LEADseeker imaging system (GE Healthcare). Viability interactions
of SMARTpools with MLN4924 were scored according to Bliss
independence (BI) assumptions that enable siRNAs to be
ranked based on magnitude of effect (31). BI and Rescue scores
allow for the assignment of synthetic lethal (BI < 0), epistatic
(BI > 0, Rescue > 0), or suppressor (BI > 0, Rescue < 0)
phenotypes to the RNAi results.
SMARTpool hits were deconvoluted in sextuplicate under
identical conditions, except that 8 nmol/L individual oligo was
used. Calculation of false discovery rates (FDR) was achieved
using a random permutation of deconvoluted data, as outlined
in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
For HCT-116 cell transfections, changes included the use of
450 cells per well, transfection with Lipofectamine RNAiMax
(Life Technologies) at 20 nL/well, and McCoy5A growth medium (Life Technologies). After 48 hours of knockdown, HCT-116
cells were treated with 0, 91, or 116 nmol/L MLN4924 for an
additional 48 hours before assaying cell viability by ATPlite.
MLN4924 will be made available to qualiﬁed researchers once a
standard Materials Transfer Agreement has been executed.
Flow cytometry
A375 cells were reverse transfected on 96-well PDL-coated
black, clear-bottom plates (CELLCOAT, Greiner) using 15
nmol/L siRNA oligos (siGENOME SMARTpool, Dharmacon)
and 84 nL/well DharmaFECT 4 reagent (DH4, Dharmacon) in
Opti-MEM (Life Technologies). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated in triplicate with 500 nmol/L
MLN4924 or vehicle [0.005% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] and
incubated for 22 hours. Cells were pulsed with 10 mmol/L 5bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Life Technologies) for 30 minutes, trypsinized, ﬁxed, and denatured. Cells were stained with
undiluted ﬂuorescein isothiocynate (FITC)-conjugated antiBrdUrd (BD Pharmingen), washed, and stained with 1 mg/mL
propidium iodide (Life Technologies). Flow cytometry was
conducted using a Becton Dickinson FACSCanto II with High
Throughput Sampler. Flow cytometry data were analyzed as
outlined in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

MLN4924 Genome-Wide RNAi Screen

Cells-to-CT kit (Applied Biosystems #AM1729) according to
manufacturer's protocols and was conducted on Biomek FX
Liquid Handling System. TaqMan Gene Expression Assays kits
were purchased from Applied Biosystems and data were
generated with an ABI7900HT system.
Western blotting
A375 cells were treated with 650 nmol/L MLN4924 or vehicle
(0.065% DMSO) for the times indicated. For UV irradiation,
A375 cells were exposed to 30 J/m2 UV and then incubated for
24 hours. To induce a G1–S-phase arrest, A375 cells were
treated with 1 mg/mL aphidicolin for 24 hours. For each
sample, a large batch of cells was lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer and prepared for SDS-PAGE and
quantitative immunoblot analysis with antisera as speciﬁed in
the Supplementary Table S1A using tubulin as a normalization
control so that the coefﬁcient of variance across samples was
less than 16%. This set of samples was then used to run multiple
Western blots. Western blot intensity was quantiﬁed using an
Odyssey Infrared Imager (LI-COR Biosciences). Full-length
blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. S1. Antibody details
are presented in Supplementary Table S1A.

Results
Genome-wide siRNA screen
Gene knockdown in A375 cells was conducted with 15 nmol/L
Dharmacon SMARTpool siRNA oligos for 48 hours to deplete
cellular proteins, followed by 48-hour treatment with 2 concentrations of MLN4924 [LC25 (250 nmol/L) and LC70 (650 nmol/L)]
or a vehicle control. These concentrations of MLN4924 enabled
the evaluation of either enhancement or suppression of
MLN4924-induced cell death by the SMARTpools. A375 cells
are highly transfectable and display an average amount of
rereplication following MLN4924 treatment relative to other
cell lines, as measured by the accumulation of cells with a more
than 4N DNA content (Supplementary Fig. S2). The genomewide screen was conducted with 21,062 SMARTpools in duplicate (Supplementary Table S1B and Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Following reconﬁrmation of 2239 SMARTpool hits (Supplementary Table S1C and Supplementary Fig. S3B–E), 1221 different
genes were deconvoluted, with separate wells for each individual
oligo at 8 nmol/L siRNA (Supplementary Table S1D and S1E and
Supplementary Fig. S4).
Using permutation analysis and conﬁrmation of gene
expression (Supplementary Table S1F and S1G), 109 hits were
identiﬁed with an FDR P < 0.05 based on 3 of the 4 oligos
interacting with MLN4924 (O3 criteria, Table 1). An additional
45 hits were identiﬁed with an FDR 0.05 < P < 0.10 based on 3 of
4 oligos (O3 criteria). These hits were classiﬁed according to
their gene annotation (Fig. 1).
Importantly, the screen captured key aspects of biology
previously shown to be important for MLN4924 mechanism
of action, including genes involved in the ubiquitin pathway,
DNA damage repair (DDR), cell cycle, TNF family receptors,
and apoptosis. However, genes within the p53 pathway,
BRCA1/BRCA2 complex, transcription-coupled, and base excision repair pathways were identiﬁed that had not previously
been implicated in the mechanism of cell death induced

www.aacrjournals.org

by MLN4924. These hits represent genes whose function
may be directly dysregulated by MLN4924. In interpreting
RNAi screens, it is important to remember key limitations of
RNAi, including transient protein knockdown, incomplete
elimination of the protein, genetic redundancy, and off-target
effects.
Consistent with NAE being the primary target of MLN4924,
the 2 hits with the greatest degree of synthetic lethality
following deconvolution (Table 1) were UBA3 and NAE1,
encoding the heterodimeric subunits of NAE. Depletion of
either UBA3 or NAE1 by RNAi in cells therefore seems to reduce
the effective concentration of MLN4924 required to achieve a
critical level of inhibition of the NEDD8 pathway that results in
cell death.
The hits with the greatest degree of suppression of
MLN4924-induced lethality included CDT1, CASP8, and
TEX10, a protein associated with the SLX4 Holliday junction
resolvase (32). Depletion of CDT1 would be expected to
reduce prereplication licensing, thereby preventing cell
death, consistent with its scoring as a suppressor. Hits were
also evaluated using 2 or 4 out of 4 oligos (O2 and O4 criteria,
Supplementary Table S2A and S2B), although these criteria
captured fewer hits.
Behavior of genes in HCT-116
The deconvoluted siRNA oligos against 240 genes were also
evaluated in HCT-116 cells at 91 and 116 nmol/L MLN4924
(LC50 and LC80, respectively, Supplementary Tables S1H and
S1I), of which 24 (10%) scored as hits by O4 criteria following
permutation of results from 240 randomly selected genes
(Supplementary Table S2C). Fewer hits were identiﬁed by
either O2 or O3 criteria (Supplementary Table S1I). With the
exception of the TCR/BER gene set, the depletion of the DDR
and cell-cycle genes that impacted A375 sensitivity of
MLN4924 did not similarly impact HCT-116 sensitivity.
Because HCT-116 rereplicates its DNA following treatment
with MLN4924 even more substantially than does A375 (Supplementary Fig. S2), we hypothesized that genetic differences
in DDR mechanisms between A375 and HCT-116 may substantially impact the response to MLN4924. Therefore, deconvoluted siRNA oligos against 317 genes with known DNA
damage response roles were evaluated in HCT-116 cells at
91 nmol/L MLN4924 (Supplementary Table S1H & S1I, Run 3),
of which 9 scored as hits (Supplementary Table S2C, annotated
with #). Notably, 6 of these have known roles within the G2–M
checkpoint, with knockdown of FBXO5 (encoding Emi1), CDK1,
and PLK1 giving the most signiﬁcant effects.
Cell-cycle interactions of hits with MLN4924
MLN4924 induces DNA rereplication by stabilizing the
replication licensing factor Cdt1 (12). To quantify the effect
of MLN4924 on the cell cycle and to better characterize how
MLN4924 might affect previously studied rereplication checkpoints, A375 cells transfected with control siRNA (GL2) were
treated with vehicle or 500 nM MLN4924 for 22 hours, pulselabeled with BrdUrd, stained with propidium iodide, and then
subjected to ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 2A). MLN4924 resulted in
changes to most phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 2B), including

not incorporating BrdUrd (labeled as 2N-4N) and cells with
more than 4N DNA actively incorporating BrdUrd. Of note, subG1 cells were not captured in this analysis due to their loss in
plate washing.
We evaluated the effect of depleting 11 genes directly
associated with the prereplication complex or origin ﬁring, as
well as UBA3 (Fig. 2C), treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or
MLN4924. Knockdown of 9 of these genes in vehicle-treated
cells resulted in an accumulation in G2–M, generally with loss
of S-phase. These results suggest that depletion of key repli-

228

Cancer Res; 73(1) January 1, 2013

cation licensing proteins results in defective replication leading to cell-cycle arrest at a G2–M checkpoint rather than in
inhibition of origin ﬁring. Engagement of the G2–M checkpoint
is consistent with the response to rereplication as previously
characterized genetically.(15, 16) Following treatment by
MLN4924, a loss of S-phase was again seen, although the
pattern shifted, as depletion of key replication licensing proteins resulted in an accumulation of cells with 2N-4N (arrested)
or more than 4N (rereplicating) DNA content, suggesting that
the rereplicating cells were less able to progress to G2 in the
presence of MLN4924.

We also evaluated the effect of knockdown of a further 86
genes that function more broadly in cell cycle and DNA
damage responses for changes to the cell-cycle effects of
MLN4924. In total, depletion of 69 genes signiﬁcantly
impacted the cell-cycle distribution following MLN4924
treatment (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S5 and Supplementary

Broadly, depletion of these genes can be categorized as
affecting MLN4924-induced cell-cycle changes by their most
signiﬁcant impact on the cell cycle, namely increase in G1
content (BRIP1-XRCC3), decrease in S-phase content (ATRUBE2L3), accumulation of cells with 2N-4N (arrested) DNA
content (CHEK2-RPA1), accumulation of cells with more than
4N (rereplicating) DNA content (ATM-XRCC2), or reduction in
the number of cells with 2N-4N (arrested) DNA (DDX3XTNFRSF10B). Notably, knockdown of 6 of the 12 genes

Extent of rereplication does not signiﬁcantly correlate
with cell death
Surprisingly, these cell-cycle changes (Fig. 2C, 3 and
Supplementary Fig. S5) did not signiﬁcantly correlate with
the viability effects of genes with signiﬁcant MLN4924
interactions. Genes whose knockdown resulted in the signiﬁcant accumulation of cells in G1 for vehicle-treated cells
were marginally negatively associated with a synthetic lethal
phenotype (5 of 22, P ¼ 0.18). Genes whose knockdown led to
increased >4N DNA content following MLN4924 treatment
were marginally negatively associated with a suppressor
phenotype (2 of 8, P ¼ 0.14). Thus, S-phase content before
treatment seems to be important for MLN4924 sensitivity
and increased >4N DNA following treatment increased cell
death, although both effects were modest. These results

230

Cancer Res; 73(1) January 1, 2013

suggest that the function of these genes in the response to
MLN4924 may not be fully realized by their effects on the cell
cycle.
Upregulation of p53 and p21 is independent of Cdt1 or
ATR
To understand better the sequence of events for induction of
checkpoints, we evaluated the effect of depleting CDT1, TP53,
ATM, and ATR by Western blot analysis on key proteins (Fig. 4).
These data showed efﬁcient knockdown of CDT1, TP53, and
ATM. As expected, knockdown of CDT1 or ATR following
treatment of cells with MLN4924 signiﬁcantly reduced the
phosphorylation of ATR substrates, including Rpa32 and Chk1,
as well as the stabilization of claspin and the phosphorylation
of Rb. Surprisingly, knockdown of CDT1 or ATR had little
impact on increases in p53 or p21, whereas TP53 depletion
was very efﬁcient in blocking these effects. A spliceform of
Puma was also unaffected by CDT1 depletion but reduced by
TP53 depletion. Therefore, unexpectedly, the upregulation of
p53 and p21 seems to be independent of DNA damage induced
by Cdt1 stabilization, particularly as detected by ATR signaling.

Figure 4. MLN4924 affects the p53 pathway independently of Cdt1 or ATR
signaling. The ability of MLN4924 to regulate key proteins was evaluated
following knockdown of the indicated genes. Knockdown of either CDT1
or ATR affected the regulation of one group of proteins (CDT1-Dep), but
had much less impact on another group of proteins (TP53-Dep). In
contrast, knockdown of TP53 affected only the regulation of the TP53Dep group of proteins.

Activation of ATR by MLN4924 in A375 cells
MLN4924 has been previously shown to induce the phosphorylation of ATR substrates including Chk1, Rad17, and
Nbs1 in HCT-116 cells (12). However, depletion of ATR and
its substrates only moderately inﬂuenced the effect of
MLN4924 on cell viability and the cell cycle (Table 1
and Fig. 3). Knockdown of ATR does efﬁciently block phosphorylation of Rpa32 (Fig. 4). Thus, activation of ATR or a
critical downstream pathway may be blocked. Figure 5A
compares MLN4924 with 2 control treatments known to
activate ATR, aphidicolin, and UV (34). Phosphorylation of
the ATR targets Chk1, Mcm2, Nbs1, Rad17, and Rpa32 was
similar between all three treatments, whereas Cdc25A, a
substrate of Chk1 that is targeted for degradation by CRL1bTRCP (35), was preferentially stabilized by MLN4924.
Among the other proteins previously shown to be CRL4-Cdt2
substrates (Cdt1, p21, Set8) or otherwise associated with
MLN4924 activity (p-H2Ax and p53), Cdt1 and p21 stabilization
most differentiated MLN4924 from the other 2 treatments.
Phosphorylation of ATR substrates following MLN4924
treatment occurs in a single wave at approximately 10 hours
to half-maximal phosphorylation, consistent with these being
substrates of a single kinase (Fig. 5B). Therefore, MLN4924
clearly activates ATR, as previously described (12). If MLN4924
directly interferes with the establishment of the ATR-dependent checkpoint, it seems to be through the stabilization
of Cdc25A or events further downstream from ATR
phosphorylation.

Our original interest in developing an NAE inhibitor was
based on an emerging knowledge of the cullin-dependent
degradation of many cancer relevant proteins, the dysregulation of which could provide a therapeutic beneﬁt. Overall, the
data obtained in our MLN4924 synthetic lethal screen align
well with prior genetic studies on rereplication and in that
many of the genes affecting MLN4924 sensitivity are directly
involved in the prereplication complex and DNA replication,
including PCNA, MCM7, DTL, CDT1, TK1, RPA1, RRM2, and
DHFR. Importantly, DDR mechanisms were also well represented in these viability screen results.
These DDR mechanisms included p53, BRCA1/2, transcription-coupled repair, base excision repair, and histones. Some
aspects of these results could have been anticipated. For
example, CRL4 has clear roles in transcription-coupled repair
(36) and histone monoubiquitination (9). However, while
multiple CRLs have been proposed to regulate p53 (37), the
precise CRL for p53 relevant in this setting is not clear.
Generally, characterization of the role of p53 and p21 in
MLN4924 and rereplication biology has included intra-S-phase
and G2–M checkpoint control and the induction of senescence
(11, 38, 39). Our data suggest that the intra-S-phase checkpoint
is the most important in this setting. Finally, the roles of CRLs
in regulating BRCA1/BRCA2 and base excision repair have not
yet been characterized. The role of BRCA1 in rereplication is
understood to be promoting the G2–M checkpoint (40), thereby protecting against cell death. Contrary to these expectations, depletion of most of the BRCA1/BRCA2-associated genes,
especially BARD1, resulted in suppression, suggesting a role in
promoting cell death. Three BRCA-associated genes, BARD1,
BRCA1, and BRIP1, signiﬁcantly reduced S-phase content (Fig.
3), suggesting that the role of this complex in DNA replication
and S-phase progression may account for this discordance (41).
Strikingly, early steps in BRCA1 complex formation are synthetic lethal, whereas genes in later steps are suppressors,
suggesting that MLN4924 may affect BRCA1 function at the
transition between these 2 sets of genes, similar to the interaction between bortezomib and genes within the Myc-polyamine pathway (31).
Discordance with HCT-116
We were initially surprised by the lack of overlap in the
results between HCT-116 and A375 (Supplementary Table
S2C). However, evaluation of the 317 DNA damage response
genes suggested that HCT-116 fails to engage the intra-S-phase
checkpoint but proceeds to a G2–M checkpoint instead. Stabilization of Emi1 (encoded by FBXO5) through the inhibition
of CRL1-bTRCP by MLN4924 may account for the activation of
this checkpoint. Flow cytometry data suggest signiﬁcant differences in the effect of MLN4924 on the cell-cycle proﬁle of
HCT-116 and A375 consistent with activation of different
checkpoints (Supplementary Fig. S2). Garner and Eastman
found that of the 59 cell lines in the NCI-60 panel, only 4
arrested in G2 rather than S-phase in response to the topoisomerase I inhibitor SN-38, including HCT-116 (42). Overexpression of MRE11A in HCT-116 cells rescued the S-phase
arrest defect. Importantly, RAD50 siRNA was synthetic lethal

Figure 5. Phosphorylation of ATR substrates does not show dysregulation by MLN4924, although Cdc25A is rapidly stabilized. A, MLN4924 induces the
phosphorylation of multiple ATR substrates, similar to other inducers of ATR activity, including aphidicolin and UV. Only the stabilization of Cdc25A, a Chk1regulated event, differentiates MLN4924 from the other treatments. The kinetics of these phosphorylations are compared with the changes of
other proteins previously shown to be substrates of CRL4-Cdt2 (Cdt1, p21, and Set8) or regulated by MLN4924. V, vehicle; M, MLN4924. B, the data were
quantiﬁed by Odyssey Infrared Imager and normalized so that the 4-hour vehicle time point was 0 and the maximally regulated time point was 1. Maximum
fold effect is indicated parenthetically beside each protein name. Cdt1 and Cdc25A achieved half-maximal stabilization within 3 hours. Phosphorylation
of Chk1, Mcm2, Nbs1, Rad17, and Rpa32 achieved half-maximal levels in approximately 10 hours. Stabilization of p53 and p21 as well as phosphorylation of
p53 and H2Ax achieved half-maximal levels in 15 to 23 hours. As we have not shown the linearity of response with our antibodies, kinetics of protein effects are
only approximate.

with MLN4924 in A375 cells but not HCT-116 cells. Mismatch
repair–deﬁcient cells, including HCT-116, also fail to arrest in
S-phase following ionizing radation treatment, in contrast to
mismatch repair–proﬁcient cells (43, 44).
The evaluation of gene knockdown using orthogonal techniques generally gives a much greater sense of the biologic
impact of those genes. Notably, depletion of 69 genes gave
signiﬁcant cell-cycle interactions with MLN4924 (Fig. 2C and 3).
The combined viability and cell-cycle data inform our understanding of the phenotypic consequences of NAE inhibition as
discussed below and summarized in Fig. 6.
Regulation of replication origin ﬁring
The canonical response to rereplication stress is G2–M
phase accumulation (Fig. 6, blue arrows; refs. 15, 16), consistent
with the results obtained for knockdown of replication genes
(Fig. 2C). Following treatment with MLN4924, the cell-cycle
impact of depletion of these genes was more divergent (Fig. 6,
red arrows).

Cancer Res; 73(1) January 1, 2013

Intra S-phase checkpoint activation
Of the 32 genes whose depletion resulted in a signiﬁcant
increase in extensive rereplication as indicated by the accumulation of more than 4N DNA content (Fig. 3), 11 were
associated with p53, including TP53, ATM, MDM2, CDKN1A,
SFN, RRM2B (45), FKBP3 (46), KLF5 (47), PPP1R10 (48), RAB35
(49), and RBM38 (50). Knockdown of most of these genes also
resulted in the reduction of the cells with 2N-4N DNA content.
These results suggest that p53 activation by MLN4924 limits
the extent of rereplication, consistent with genetic studies on
rereplication (23).
Surprisingly, depletion of ATR, CHEK1 and RAD1 did not
result in a signiﬁcant loss of cells with 2N-4N DNA, although
depletion of CDC25A and HUS1 did. Therefore, the intra-Sphase checkpoint is not clearly ATR-dependent, but is clearly
p53-dependent, at least with continuous treatment by
MLN4924. Washout experiments suggest that MLN4924
requires more than 8 hours to induce a stable p53-dependent
intra-S-phase checkpoint, (11) consistent with the relatively

slow induction of p53 and p21 (Fig. 5B, 19 hours to halfmaximal levels). In addition, depletion of ATR pathway genes
did not affect sensitivity of HCT-116.
These results highlight one key difference between our data
and the genetic interference studies on the regulation of
replication origin ﬁring, namely that very few genes within
the ATR-dependent checkpoints were found to interact with
MLN4924 in the A375 viability screen. Other researchers have
suggested that MLN4924 may interfere with the function of the
ATR-dependent checkpoints (12, 51). Our data suggests that
the p21-dependent intra-S-phase checkpoint (52) may play a
more dominant role in the response of A375 cells to NAE

inhibition by MLN4924. Importantly, the ability of MLN4924 to
induce the p21-dependent intra-S-phase checkpoint seems to
be independent of Cdt1 stabilization or signaling through ATR
(Fig. 4). In addition, MLN4924 stabilizes Cdc25A (Fig. 5A),
which may account for the direct interference of MLN4924 in
the activation of the ATR-dependent intra-S-phase checkpoint
(53). The impact of MLN4924 beyond Cdt1 stabilization shows
that MLN4924 will not simply mimic CDT1 overexpression.
A genome-wide siRNA viability screen provides an unbiased
way of surveying possible drug mechanisms. We have used
such a screen to characterize the genetics of sensitivity of the
melanoma cell line A375 to MLN4924. Although it remains to be
determined precisely how NAE inhibition impacts these multiple pathways, these results together with those investigating
changes in protein expression following MLN4924 treatment
(33, Supplementary Table S1K) will facilitate a better mechanistic understanding of the cullin-dependent regulatory and
repair processes that compromise the viability of cancer cells.
