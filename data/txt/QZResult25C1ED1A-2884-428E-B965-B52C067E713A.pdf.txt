Abstract

Author Manuscript

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, with a
median survival of about one year1. This poor prognosis is due to therapeutic resistance and tumor
recurrence following surgical removal. Precisely how recurrence occurs is unknown. Using a
genetically-engineered mouse model of glioma, we identify a subset of endogenous tumor cells
that are the source of new tumor cells after the drug, temozolomide (TMZ), is administered to
transiently arrest tumor growth. A Nestin-ΔTK-IRES-GFP (Nes-ΔTK-GFP) transgene that labels
quiescent subventricular zone adult neural stem cells also labels a subset of endogenous glioma
tumor cells. Upon arrest of tumor cell proliferation with TMZ, pulse-chase experiments
demonstrate a tumor re-growth cell hierarchy originating with the Nes-ΔTK-GFP transgene
subpopulation. Ablation of the GFP+ cells with chronic ganciclovir administration significantly
arrested tumor growth and combined TMZ-ganciclovir treatment impeded tumor development.
These data indicate the existence of a relatively quiescent subset of endogenous glioma cells that
are responsible for sustaining long-term tumor growth through the production of transient
populations of highly proliferative cells.

We have extensively studied a series of mouse strains harboring conditional alleles of the
tumor suppressors NF1, p53 and Pten, that spontaneously develop malignant gliomas with
100% penetrance, and have identified the source cells of these tumors as deriving from the
subventricular zone (SVZ)2–4. Thus, we proposed that adult neural stem cells (NSCs) are the
likely source of these tumors2. We wished to determine whether a Nestin-ΔTK-IRES-GFP
(Nes-ΔTK-GFP) transgene5, originally devised to mark adult NSCs, would also mark
endogenous glioma cells. Elements of the nestin gene can drive transgene expression
specifically in adult NSCs2, 5 (Fig. 1a). The transgene also harbors a cassette containing a
modified version of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (ΔTK) allowing for
temporally regulated ablation of dividing neural progenitors by systemic ganciclovir (GCV)
administration, and an IRES-GFP cassette to mark Nes-ΔTK-expressing cells in the absence
of GCV. The Nes-ΔTK-GFP transgenic mice showed the expected expression in both glial
fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive adult NSCs and early doublecortin (DCX)-positive
neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the major adult NSC niche: the SVZ of the lateral ventricle
(Fig. 1b, c). To validate that the GCV-activated Nes-ΔTK-GFP transgene could effectively
eliminate endogenous neural stem/progenitor cells, one-month-old transgenic mice were
treated with GCV for two weeks. In control mice, the rostral migratory stream (RMS),
formed by NPCs migrating from the SVZ to the olfactory bulb, is visualized by Nissl
staining. In contrast, the RMS was severely diminished in Nes-ΔTK-GFP mice after GCV
treatment (Fig. 1b, bottom panel). Consistent with this observation, DCX immunostaining
indicated absence of NPCs in the SVZ of GCV-treated Nes-ΔTK-GFP animals (Fig. 1c,
bottom panel). Since in the presence of GCV, HSV-TK targets only proliferating cells, the
GFAP-positive NSCs that remained quiescent were unaffected, although they also express
the transgene as indicated by GFP (Fig. 1c, bottom panel). Thus, our Nes-ΔTK-GFP
transgene is specifically expressed in SVZ quiescent and proximal progenitor cells and
chronic GCV administration effectively blocks neurogenesis by ablating quiescent cells as
they enter the cell cycle.

Author Manuscript

We bred the Nes-ΔTK-GFP transgene into hGFAP-Cre;NF1f/+;P53f/f;PTENf/+ (Mut7)
glioma-prone mice3. Mut7 mice develop malignant glioma, with full penetrance, by somatic
deletion of three of the most frequently mutated tumor suppressors in GBM: p53, NF1 and
Pten7. All Mut7;Nes-ΔTK-GFP mice also developed gliomas and we observed only a subset
of tumor cells expressing GFP (Nes-ΔTK-GFP positive; Fig. 1d, e). These cells also coexpressed the neural stem cell marker Sox2 (not shown). We next examined tumor cell
proliferation and found that Mut7;Nes-ΔTK-GFP tumors exhibited a significant proportion
of Ki67-positive/GFP-negative cells, and conversely, the subset of GFP-positive tumor cells
rarely co-stained for Ki67 (Fig. 1e, f). These data indicate that most transgene GFP-positive
tumor cells are relatively quiescent in comparison to a highly proliferative (Ki67+)
subpopulation reminiscent of the SVZ where GFP-positive stem cells are quiescent
compared to GFP-negative progenitors (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, as in wild type mice, where
the Nes-ΔTK-GFP transgene does not affect SVZ neurogenesis in the absence of GCV
administration (Fig. 1b, c), introduction of the transgene into the Mut7 genetic background
did not impact tumor development or enhance survival (Fig. 1g). Like Mut7 mice,
Mut7;Nes-ΔTK-GFP mice developed malignant glioma with 100% penetrance and with
similar kinetics (Fig. 1g, h).

TMZ is a DNA alkylating agent that is currently the primary chemotherapy agent for GBM
patients6 as it has transient tumor growth arrest properties. We found that TMZ eradicates
proliferative cells in the endogenous murine gliomas. TMZ was administered over several
days to tumor-bearing mice followed by BrdU injection two hours after final treatment, and
the mice sacrificed two hours thereafter (Fig. 2a). The TMZ-treated mice exhibited dramatic
reduction of BrdU incorporation in both the tumors and NSC niches of TMZ-treated mice
(Fig. 2b, c). Similar to treated glioma patients following TMZ treatment, the murine tumors
reinitiated cell division and growth. Thus, TMZ targets proliferating cells but tumor
recurrence is inevitable. To examine the details of tumor recurrence, we traced the first wave
of tumor cell proliferation following completion of the drug regimen on tumor-bearing mice
by pulse-chase using the BrdU analogs CldU and IdU. CldU and IdU were injected one day
and three days, respectively, after the final TMZ injection (Fig. 2d). Given the variable but
relatively low proportion of GFP-positive cells in all tumors (Fig. 1d, e), we reasoned that if
cell proliferation reinitiated randomly in tumor cells after TMZ treatment, then the number
of GFP-positive cells that would incorporate CldU and/or IdU should be low to
insignificant. However, if renewed tumor cell proliferation was hierarchical and derived
from the GFP-positive cells, a biased incorporation of nucleotide analogs into the relatively
small GFP-positive cohort of tumor cells would result. Examination of tumor sections with
IHC revealed that the large majority of cells incorporating CldU and IdU after relatively
short chases also contained GFP expression (Fig. 2e, GFP% in CldU+ population = 77±14,
GFP% in IdU+ population = 83±10). Moreover, IdU-positive cells retained both GFP and
CldU, indicating that following TMZ eradication of a majority of pre-existing proliferating
tumor cells, the re-emergent population of proliferating cells derived from Nes-ΔTK-GFPexpressing cells and not from random tumor or other specific subsets of cells (Fig. 2e, CldU
% in IdU+ population=86±9). When the second, IdU, pulse was prolonged to a seven day
chase following CldU pulse, most IdU cells double-labeled for CldU (85±7%) but lost GFP
expression (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). Thus, as in the normal SVZ stem cell niche, over
time, the GFP-expressing glioma cell population gives rise to cells that progressively lose
stem cell properties (i.e. nestin expression and relative quiescence) and concomitantly shut
down the Nes-ΔTK-GFP transgene (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d). Using endogenous lineage
tracing of renewed cell division within tumors, we have identified the relatively quiescent
Nes-ΔTK-GFP-expressing tumor cells as the primary source of proliferating and eventually
non-dividing tumor cell derivatives (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d). In addition, the data show
that in our endogenous glioma models, TMZ targets the proliferating derivatives but not the
GFP+ quiescent cells.

One prediction would be that eradication of the GFP-positive cells in the endogenous
tumors should significantly decrease appearance of new dividing tumor cells. We tested this
prediction at two stages: early endogenous tumor development and advanced tumor
development. First, Mut7;Nes-ΔTK-GFP mice were treated with GCV beginning at eight
weeks of age – the earliest time of detectable pre-tumorigenic anomalies3. To capture most
quiescent GFP-positive cells in a dividing state, GCV treatment lasted for ten weeks,
requiring three osmotic minipump placement surgeries that unfortunately were accompanied
by complications resulting in significant variance of drug delivery. Drug delivery efficacy
was qualitatively measured by examination of the normal stem cell niche response to drug

(Fig. 1b, c) as manifested by residual RMS (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Accordingly, tumor
incidence varied from mouse to mouse, with some perishing early with large tumors.
However, as a group, the GCV-treated cohort showed a clear survival advantage (Fig. 3a).
After ten weeks of treatment, the only surviving mice were among those treated with GCV
(Supplementary Fig. 2b), and analysis of their brains revealed only low-grade lesions
(Supplementary Fig. 2c). When GCV was effectively delivered, survival was substantially
prolonged and tumor progression was severely impaired. Thus, elimination of Nes-ΔTKGFP-positive cells at early/pretumorigenic stages prevents development of high-grade
gliomas.

Author Manuscript

A second GCV regimen was commenced in ten-week-old tumor-bearing mice. Most tenweek-old Mut7 mice do not show neurological symptoms yet histological examination of
large cohorts showed that all mice harbor astrocytoma of differing grades (Supplementary
Fig. 3). We subjected ten-week-old Mut7;Nes-ΔTK-GFP or Mut7 mice to GCV or saline for
two months. GCV treatment of Mut7;Nes-ΔTK-GFP mice improved survival by
approximately thirty days compared to saline control, while neither treatment was effective
in improving survival of Mut7 mice (Fig. 3b). Consistent with this, GFP and endogenous
nestin double-immunostaining showed that GFP-positive cells were successfully eliminated
in gliomas of Mut7;Nes-ΔTK-GFP mice following prolonged GCV treatment (Fig. 3c).

Author Manuscript

The residual tumors in these tumor-bearing Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice treated with GCV
beginning at 10 weeks of age did not have the classic glioma feature of invasiveness but
instead were circumscribed with well defined boundaries (Fig. 3d, e, Supplementary Fig. 2d,
e). Although the Mut7;Nes-ΔTK-GFP transgene is only expressed in a subset of cells in the
untreated tumor (Fig. 1e), tumors in GCV-treated Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice showed a marked
reduction of Ki67-positive cells and stem cell markers (Fig. 3e–g). These data further
support the hypothesis that chronic GCV administration progressively ablates the relatively
quiescent GFP+ tumor cell population and the remaining GFP- tumor cells eventually
exhaust their proliferative and infiltrative potential.
The HSV-TK system has been widely used as a method to induce endogenous cell suicide.
A potentially confounding phenomenon is the “bystander effect” whereby HSV-TKexpressing cells not only commit suicide in the presence of GCV, but can also induce the
death of neighboring non-TK-expressing cells7. However, several NSC-specific HSV-TKexpressing transgenic mice have been reported and no bystander effect has been
described8–11. To examine whether tumor development was appreciably impaired by the
bystander effect, we turned to transplantation assays.

Author Manuscript

We first determined whether GCV treatment would also blunt Mut7;Nes-ΔTK-GFP tumor
growth in a transplantation assay. Primary gliomas from Mut7;Nes-ΔTK-GFP and Mut7
mice were dissociated and directly injected subcutaneously into nude mice in the presence of
continuous GCV or saline treatment (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Neither GCV nor saline
affected the tumor growth of Mut7-derived cells (Supplementary Fig. 4b). In contrast,
similar to a previous report12, mice transplanted with Mut7;Nes-ΔTK tumor cells and then
treated with GCV developed significantly smaller tumors that appeared poorly vascularized
compared to saline-treated controls (Supplementary Fig. 4c–f). Thus, the Mut7 tumor cells

transplant efficiently in immunocompromised mice, and, as in the endogenous setting (Fig.
3), GCV treatment severely impairs tumor development following transplantation. To test
for bystander effect, we transduced primary Mut7 cells with a lentivirus harboring either a
control RFP cassette or an HSV-TK cassette (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Mixed ratios of the
two cell populations were injected subcutaneously into nude mice and allowed to seed
tumors for four weeks after which GCV was administered for two weeks (Supplementary
Fig. 5b). The data indicate that the presence of a 10%, 20%, or 50% initial ratio of TKexpressing tumor cells did not impair tumor development of the non-TK-expressing cells in
the presence of GCV (Supplementary Fig. 5c, d). In the extreme case when equal numbers
of TK positive (105) and TK negative (105) cells were injected compared to 105 TK negative
cells alone, tumor development was equivalent in both cohorts demonstrating that GCV
toxicity to 50% of the tumor cells did not extend into the TK-negative tumor cell population
(Supplementary Fig. 5c, d). In our endogenous tumors, such a bystander effect would
require the relatively rare GFP+ tumor-propagating cells to be widely toxic to have a
significant paracrine effect on tumor properties. Instead, these studies indicate that GCV
administration does not have an appreciable effect on cells outside those expressing the TK
gene, consistent with other recently reported studies8–12. We conclude that eradication of the
Mut7;Nes-ΔTK-GFP endogenous tumor cells via GCV treatment effectively disrupts the
continued production of tumor cells as predicted from the preceding data.

Author Manuscript

Despite effective depletion of GFP-expressing tumor-propagating cells with GCV treatment,
a significant residual tumor mass remained (Fig. 3d). We therefore attempted a therapeutic
strategy to eliminate both the rapidly proliferating tumor cells and the quiescent GFP+ cells,
by sequentially administering TMZ and GCV, respectively (Fig. 4a, b). Initially it appeared
that this regimen did not prolong survival beyond that of GCV treatment alone (Fig. 4c).
However, examination of the brains of the sequentially treated mice revealed only vestigial
tumors in the dorsal brain that showed no transgene-GFP expression, indicating effective
depletion (Fig. 4d). The cellular density of the residual TMZ/GCV-treated tumors was lower
than that of tumors at the beginning of treatment (10 weeks), indicating a statistically
significant reduction in tumor bulk. This contrast was significantly enhanced when treated
tumors were compared to untreated control tumors (Fig. 4e), which manifested in a spectrum
of survival time from 12 to 16 weeks. Thus, the combined treatment had dramatic inhibitory
effects on dorsal tumor growth in these mice.

Author Manuscript

We were puzzled that TMZ/GCV treatment did not significantly prolong survival beyond
the GCV-only treated mice where residual circumscribed tumor mass remained (Fig. 3d, e,
Supplementary Fig. 2d, e). Analysis of the TMZ/GCV-treated brains revealed that despite
the dramatic inhibition of original tumor growth, these mice developed novel tumors in the
ventral brain region. Six of seven TMZ/GCV-treated mice showed tumors in the brain stem
region, whereas gliomas in untreated Mut7 mice, and their remnants in the successfully
treated mice are predominantly located in the dorsal/midbrain (Supplementary Fig. 6a).
Examination of the TMZ/GCV-resistant hindbrain tumors revealed high endogenous nestin
protein but no GFP expression (SupplementaryFig. 6b,c). We also searched archived
material and found that a small percentage of Mut7 brains harbored both dorsal and ventral
tumors that we now appreciate were independently arising and not extensions of the dorsal

tumors. Appearance of ventral tumors in the presence of GCV indicates an inactive NesΔTK-GFP transgene, and direct examination of untreated Mut7;Nes-ΔTK-GFP mice
demonstrated that the Nes-ΔTK-GFP transgene was indeed silent (Supplementary Fig. 6b,e).

Author Manuscript

We next examined the expression of tumor markers in these hindbrain tumors. In contrast to
typical Mut7 or Mut7;Nes-ΔTK-GFP gliomas, all ventral tumors in the TMZ/GCV group
showed low levels of endogenous GFAP but relatively high levels of S100B (Supplementary
Fig. 6c and data not shown). Seven of eleven tumors in the ventral and brain stem region of
GCV-treated mice (GCV alone or TMZ & GCV) showed histopathological features of
oligodendroglioma (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c) including high PDGFRA levels
(Supplementary Fig. 7d). This is in contrast to the pure astrocytic tumors typically observed
in this mouse model in the absence of TMZ/GCV. Thus, these data indicate that the ventral
tumors that become evident after TMZ/GCV treatment are oligoastrocytic, independently
arising, and distinct from the dorsal tumors. Such tumors were recently described in Mut3
mice13 and the source was reported to be oligodendroglial progenitors. We are currently
further characterizing these tumors.
Our Nes-ΔTK-GFP transgene labels SVZ stem cells and, fortuitously, a specific subset of
GBM cells that possesses many features proposed for cancer stem cells (CSCs). The CSC
hypothesis holds that some tumors are composed of a hierarchical cadre of cells of which
only a subset retains both self-renewal and differentiation capacity14. In this model, only
CSCs have the capacity to sustain tumor growth and are responsible for recurrence after
therapy fails.

Author Manuscript

The current standard for evaluating whether solid tumors contain CSCs is an ex-vivo limiting
dilution tumorigenic transplantation assay into immunodeficient animals14. However,
controversy regarding the presence and frequency of solid tumor CSCs remains, likely a
reflection of the variability that accompanies such assays15–18. Our study identifies a
putative endogenous glioma stem cell located at the apex of a cellular hierarchy in tumor
maintenance and recurrence following chemotherapy (Fig. 4a). Continued evaluation of
these cells and their properties, including isolation and genetic lineage tracing, may shed
important insight into novel therapeutic targets for this intractable disease.

Temozolomide, BrdU analogs, and pulse chase experiments
To determine TMZ efficiency, 10- to 11-week-old Mut7 mice were first injected
intraperitoneally with 82.5 mg/kg/d TMZ for 5 days. 50 mg/kg BrdU was injected 2 hours
after the final TMZ administration and mice were perfused 2 hours after BrdU injection. The
brain was then paraffin-processed and cut into 5 μm-thick slices. H&E staining was
performed every 70 μms to identify tumor location. Adjacent tumor sections were selected
for GFAP and BrdU co-immunostaining.

Author Manuscript

For the short term CldU chase experiments, 10- to 11-week-old Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice were
first treated with TMZ for 5 days. A total of three doses of CldU were injected, with 2-hour
intervals, the day after the final TMZ injection. A single dose of IdU was then injected 3
days after the final TMZ injection. For the long term CldU chase experiments, 10- to 11week-old Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice were first treated with TMZ for 5 days. CldU was injected 3
times a day, with 2-hour intervals, for 3 days after the final TMZ injection. A single dose of
IdU was then injected 7 days after the final TMZ injection. Mice were perfused 2 hours after
the IdU injection and the brains cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, embedded in OCT, and cut
into 14 μm-thick frozen sections. GFAP and Ki67 co-immunostaining was performed every
140 μms to locate the tumor area. Adjacent sections were selected for GFP/CldU/IdU triple
immuno-fluorescence staining.

Quantification
Because of the heterogeneous nature of the tumors, cell density, Ki67-index and BrdUpositive cell percentage were quantified using the highest staining area1. Briefly, staining
was checked under low-magnification and the highest staining area was identified. The area
was viewed at 200X in three continuous 5μm-thick sections and positive cells counted using
the measured parameters.

Characterization of the Nes-ΔTK-GFP transgene. a, Diagram of the Nes-ΔTK-GFP
transgene. b,c, GCV administration ablates neural stem cells (NSCs) in wild type mice. b,
Representative Nissl staining of the subventricular zone (SVZ) region in wild type mice
treated with GCV (WT;GCV), Nes-ΔTK transgene mice treated with PBS (Nes-ΔTK;PBS),
and Nes-ΔTK transgene mice treated with GCV (Nes-ΔTK;GCV); black arrows indicate the
stem cell rostral migratory stream (RMS), which is greatly reduced in the Nes-ΔTK;GCV
mice. c, GFP (transgene), GFAP (quiescent neural stem cells) and DCX (committed neural
progenitors) immunostaining of the subventricular zone (SVZ) stem cell niche. White
arrowheads in middle panel (Nes-ΔTK;PBS) indicate DCX-positive GFP-negative cells more
distal in the RMS. White arrowheads in bottom panel (Nes-ΔTK;GCV) indicate GFPpositive/GFAP-positive but DCX-negative quiescent NSCs. d, Representative GFP
immunostaining in sections from two untreated gliomas of Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice. From
tumor to tumor, varying numbers of GFP-positive cells were observed. e, Representative
GFP and Ki67 co-immunostaining in two untreated gliomas of Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice. White
arrowheads highlight GFP-positive but Ki67-negative cells, demonstrating that many
transgene GFP-positive cells are quiescent. f, Percentage of Ki67-positive cells in GFPpositive, GFP-negative, and overall tumor population in gliomas from untreated Mut7;NesΔTK-GFP mice. g, Kaplan–Meier survival curve of untreated Mut7 and Mut7;Nes-ΔTK

TMZ targets proliferating derivatives but not the GFP+ quiescent cell population. a, TMZ
injection schema. Mut7 mice were treated with TMZ for five days, injected with BrdU two
hours after the final TMZ treatment, and sacrificed two hours later for BrdU
immunostaining. b, Representative GFAP/BrdU co-staining of glioma from DMSO- or
TMZ-treated mice shows dramatic reduction in number of BrdU-positive cells. c,
Quantification of the percentage of maximal BrdU-positive cells in gliomas from Mut7 mice
treated with or without TMZ showed a significant decrease in the TMZ-treated mice. (Data
are mean ± s.e.m.; N=6 for each treatment; p<0.001.) d–f, Nes-ΔTK-positive cells are
resistant to TMZ and produce new tumor cells. d, Schema of TMZ treatment and short-term
labeling with BrdU analogs. Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice were treated with TMZ for 5 days and
then injected with the BrdU analogs CldU and IdU, one and three days after the last TMZ
treatment, respectively. e, Representative tumor section illustrating that repopulating tumor
cells after TMZ treatment express the Nes-ΔTK transgene (GFP+); merged panel: CldUincorporating (arrowhead) or IdU-incorporating (arrow) cells also express GFP driven by the
Nes-ΔTK transgene. (Percentage of GFP-positive cells in the CldU-positive = 77±14;
percentage of GFP-positive cells in the IdU-positive population = 83±10. N=5.) Note that
the majority of CldU-positive cells and IdU-positive cells are positive for GFP expression,
and also that the majority of IdU-positive cells are CldU-positive, indicating the CldUpositive cells gave rise to the IdU-positive cells. ***p<0.001. Student’s t-test.

GCV treatment prolongs survival of Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice. a, Kaplan–Meier curve of
Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice treated with Saline or GCV for 10 weeks starting at 8 weeks of age
showed a clear survival advantage for the GCV-treated mice (n=10 for GCV-treated; n=8
for saline-treated; P values determined using Log-rank test). b, Kaplan–Meier survival
curves of Mut7;Nes-ΔTK (left) or Mut7 (right) mice treated with GCV or Saline for 2
months starting at 10 weeks of age. GCV treatment increased survival of Mut7;Nes-ΔTK
mice compared to saline treatment but had no such effect on the Mut7 mice. (n=5–7 for the
GCV-treated mice; n=4–7 for the saline-treated mice; P values determined using Log-rank
test) c, GFP/Nestin co-immunostaining of gliomas from control (Mut7 mice treated with
GCV or Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice treated with PBS) and GCV-treated Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice.
Elimination of GFP and nestin double-positive cells in the Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice treated with
GCV from 10 weeks. d, Representative H&E staining of control and GCV-treated
Mut7;Nes-ΔTK brains. The tumors in the GCV-treated Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice are less
infiltrative than in control. Tumors indicated by black arrows. e, Representative H&E and
Sox2 staining of tumor edges in control and GCV-treated Mut7;Nes-ΔTK tumors showing
the GCV-treated tumors have a defined boundary (dotted line) and lack infiltrative Sox2+
cells. f,g, GCV treatment decreases proliferation index in Mut7;Nes-ΔTK tumors. f,
Representative Ki67 staining of control (panels 1 and 2) or GCV-treated Mut7;Nes-ΔTK
tumors (panels 3 and 4) showing the dramatic decrease in proliferation in the GCV-treated

Combination treatment of Temozolomide (TMZ) and GCV inhibits glioma progression in
cerebrum. a,b, Therapeutic schema targeting both CSCs and their proliferating progeny.
Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice were treated with TMZ for 5 days, followed two days after by GCV. c,
Kaplan–Meier survival curve of Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice with different treatments. GCV-treated
(n=7; median survival=55 days) and combinationally-treated (n=9; median survival=52.5
days) Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice had similar survival advantage over TMZ-treated (n=6; median
survival=30.5 days) or PBS-treated (n=7; median survival=21 days) mice. P values
determined using Log-rank test. d, GFP and Nestin double immunostaining of vestigial
tumors in TMZ/GCV-treated Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice (right panel) versus tumor in control (left
panel) demonstrates depletion of CSCs as evidenced by lack of GFP expression. e, Maximal
cell density in cortical tumors with different treatment regimens. Untreated Mut7 mice (n=6)
were used as control. Tumor density of 10-week-old non-symptomatic Mut7 mice (pretreatment) (n=8) was used as a reference starting point. Cell density was significantly lower
in the combinationally-treated (TMZ+GCV) Mut7;Nes-ΔTK mice (n=6) compared to
untreated tumors (p=0.0005), compared to tumors in “pre-treatment” mice (p=0.004), and
compared to tumors from mice treated with GCV only (n=4) (Data are mean ± s.e.m.;
p=0.001; P values determined using Student’s t-test.).
