Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths, but analysis of its molecular and clinical
characteristics has been complicated by histological and aetiological heterogeneity. Here we
describe a comprehensive molecular evaluation of 295 primary gastric adenocarcinomas as part of
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. We propose a molecular classification dividing gastric
cancer into four subtypes: tumours positive for Epstein–Barr virus, which display recurrent
PIK3CA mutations, extreme DNA hypermethylation, and amplification of JAK2, CD274 (also
known as PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (also knownasPD-L2); microsatellite unstable tumours, which
show elevated mutation rates, including mutations of genes encoding targetable oncogenic
signalling proteins; genomically stable tumours, which are enriched for the diffuse histological
variant and mutations of RHOA or fusions involving RHO-family GTPase-activating proteins; and
tumours with chromosomal instability, which show marked aneuploidy and focal amplification of
receptor tyrosine kinases. Identification of these subtypes provides a roadmap for patient
stratification and trials of targeted therapies.

Gastric cancer was the world’s third leading cause of cancer mortality in 2012, responsible
for 723,000 deaths1. The vast majority of gastric cancers are adenocarcinomas, which can be
further subdivided into intestinal and diffuse types according to the Lauren classification2.
An alternative system, proposed by the World Health Organization, divides gastric cancer
into papillary, tubular, mucinous (colloid) and poorly cohesive carcinomas3. These
classification systems have little clinical utility, making the development of robust
classifiers that can guide patient therapy an urgent priority.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The majority of gastric cancers are associated with infectious agents, including the
bacterium Helicobacter pylori4 and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). The distribution of
histological subtypes of gastric cancer and the frequencies of H. pylori and EBV associated
gastric cancer vary across the globe5. A small minority of gastric cancer cases are associated
with germline mutation in E-cadherin (CDH1)6 or mismatch repair genes7 (Lynch
syndrome), whereas sporadic mismatch repair-deficient gastric cancers have epigenetic
silencing of MLH1 in the context of a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)8. Molecular
profiling of gastric cancer has been performed using gene expression or DNA
sequencing9–12, but has not led to a clear biologic classification scheme. The goals of this
study by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were to develop a robust molecular
classification of gastric cancer and to identify dysregulated pathways and candidate drivers
of distinct classes of gastric cancer.

Sample set and molecular classification

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We obtained gastric adenocarcinoma primary tumour tissue (fresh frozen) from 295 patients
not treated with prior chemotherapy or radio-therapy (Supplementary Methods S1). All
patients provided informed consent, and local Institutional Review Boards approved tissue
collection. We used germline DNA from blood or non-malignant gastric mucosa as a
reference for detecting somatic alterations. Non-malignant gastric samples were also
collected for DNA methylation (n = 27) and expression (n = 29) analyses. We characterized
samples using six molecular platforms (Supplementary Methods S2–S7): array-based
somatic copy number analysis, whole-exome sequencing, array-based DNA methylation
profiling, messenger RNA sequencing, microRNA (miRNA) sequencing and reverse-phase
protein array (RPPA), with 77% of the tumours tested by all six platforms. Microsatellite
instability (MSI) testing was performed on all tumour DNA, and low-pass (~63 × coverage)
whole genome sequencing on 107 tumour/germline pairs.
To define molecular subgroups of gastric cancer we first performed unsupervised clustering
on data from each molecular platform (Supplementary Methods S2–S7) and integrated these
results, yielding four groups (Supplementary Methods S10.2). The first group of tumours
was significantly enriched for high EBV burden (P = 1.5 × 10−18) and showed extensive
DNA promoter hypermethylation. A second group was enriched for MSI(P=2.1 × 10−32)
and showed elevated mutation rates and hypermethylation (including hypermethylation at
the MLH1 promoter). The remaining two groups were distinguished by the presence or
absence of extensive somatic copy-number aberrations (SCNAs). As an alternative means to
define distinct gastric cancer subgroups, we performed integrative clustering of multiple
data types using iCluster13 (Supplementary Methods S10.3). This analysis again indicated

that EBV, MSI and the level of SCNAs characterize distinct subgroups (Supplementary Fig.
10.3). Based upon these results from analysis of all molecular platforms, we created a
decision tree to categorize the 295 gastric cancer samples into four subtypes (Fig. 1a, b)
using an approach that could more readily be applied to gastric cancer tumours in clinical
care. Tumours were first categorized by EBV-positivity (9%), then by MSI-high status,
hereafter called MSI (22%), and the remaining tumours were distinguished by degree of
aneuploidy into those termed genomically stable (20%) or those exhibiting chromosomal
instability (CIN; 50%).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Evaluation of the clinical and histological characteristics of these molecular subtypes
revealed enrichment of the diffuse histological subtype in the genomically stable group
(40/555 = 73%, P= 7.5 × 10−17) (Fig. 1c), an association not attributable to reduced SCNA
detection in low purity tumours (Supplementary Fig. 2.8). Each subtype was found
throughout the stomach, but CIN tumours showed elevated frequency in the
gastroesophageal junction/cardia (65%, P = 0.012), whereas most EBV-positive tumours
were present in the gastric fundus or body (62%, P50.03). Genomically stable tumours were
diagnosed at an earlier age (median age 59 years, P = 4 × 10−7), whereas MSI tumours were
diagnosed at relatively older ages (median 72 years, P = 5 × 10−5). MSI patients tended to
be female (56%, P=0.001), but most EBV-positive cases were male (81%, P = 0.037), as
previously reported14. We did not observe any systematic differences in distribution of
subtypes between patients of East Asian and Western origin (Supplementary Methods S1.8).
Initial outcome data from this cohort did not reveal survival differences between the four
subgroups (Supplementary Information S1.7)

EBV-associated DNA hypermethylation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

EBV is found within malignant epithelial cells in 9% of gastric cancers14. EBV status was
determined using mRNA, miRNA, exome and whole-genome sequencing, yielding highly
concordant results (Supplementary Fig. 9.7). By contrast, we detected only sporadic
evidence of H. pylori, which may reflect the decline of bacterial counts accompanying the
progression from chronic gastritis to subsequent carcinoma, as well as technical loss of
luminal bacteria during specimen processing. Unsupervised clustering of CpG methylation
performed on unpaired tumour samples revealed that all EBV-positive tumours clustered
together and exhibited extreme CIMP, distinct from that in the MSI subtype8, consistent
with prior reports15 (Fig. 2a). Differences between the EBV-CIMP and MSI-associated
gastric-CIMP methylation profiles of tumours mirrored differences between these groups in
their spectra of mutations (Fig. 1a) and gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 10.6a). EBVpositive tumours had a higher prevalence of DNA hypermethylation than any cancers
reported by TCGA (Supplementary Fig.4.6). All EBV-positive tumours assayed displayed
CDKN2A (p16INK4A) promoter hypermethylation, but lacked the MLH1 hypermethylation
characteristic of MSI-associated CIMP16. Genes with promoter hypermethylation most
differentially silenced in EBV-positive gastric cancer are shown in Supplementary Table
4.3.
We observed strong predilection for PIK3CA mutation in EBV-positive gastric cancer as
suggested by prior reports17,18, with non-silent PIK3CA mutations found in 80% of this

subgroup (P = 9 × 10−12), including 68% of cases with mutations at sites recurrent in this
data set or in the COSMIC repository. In contrast, 3 to 42% of tumours in the other subtypes
displayed PIK3CA mutations. PI(3)-kinase inhibition therefore warrants evaluation in EBVpositive gastric cancer. PIK3CA mutations were more dispersed in EBV-positive cancers,
but localized in the kinase domain (exon 20) in EBV-negative cancers (Fig. 2b). The most
highly transcribed EBV viral mRNAs and miRNAs fell within the BamH1A region of the
viral genome (Supplementary Fig. 9.8) and showed similar expression patterns across
tumours, as reported separately19.

Somatic genomic alterations

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To identify recurrently mutated genes, we analysed the 215 tumours with mutation rates
below 11.4 mutations per megabase (Mb) (none of which were MSI-positive) separately
from the 74 ‘hypermutated’ tumours. Within the hypermutated tumours, we excluded from
analysis 11 cases with a distinctly higher mutational burden above 67.7 mutations per Mb
(including one tumour with an inactivating POLE mutation20,21) (Supplementary
Information S3.2–3.3), because their large numbers of mutations unduly influence analysis.
We used the MutSigCV22 tool to define recurrent mutations in the 63 remaining
hypermutated tumours by first evaluating only base substitution mutations, identifying 10
significantly mutated genes, including TP53, KRAS, ARID1A, PIK3CA, ERBB3, PTEN and
HLA-B (Supplementary Table 3.5). We found ERBB3 mutations in 16 of 63 tumours, with
13 of these tumours having mutations at recurrent sites or sites reported in COSMIC.
MutSigCV analysis including insertions/deletions expanded the list of statistically
significant mutated genes to 37, including RNF43, B2M and NF1 (Supplementary Fig. 3.9).
Similarly, HotNet analysis of genes mutated within MSI tumours revealed common
alterations in major histocompatibility complex class I genes, including B2M and HLA-B
(Supplementary Fig. 11.5–11.7). B2M mutations in colorectal cancers and melanoma result
in loss of expression of HLA class 1 complexes23, suggesting these events benefit
hypermutated tumours by reducing antigen presentation to the immune system.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Through MutSigCV analysis of the 215 non-hypermutated tumours, we identified 25
significantly mutated genes (Fig. 3). This gene list again included TP53, ARID1A, KRAS,
PIK3CA and RNF43, but also genes in the β-catenin pathway (APC and CTNNB1), the TGFβ pathway (SMAD4 and SMAD2), and RASA1, a negative regulator of RAS. ERBB2, a
therapeutic target, was significantly mutated, with 10 of 15 mutations occurring at known
hotspots; four cases had the S310F ERBB2 mutation that is activating and drug-sensitive24.
In addition to PIK3CA mutations, EBV-positive tumours had frequent ARID1A (55%) and
BCOR (23%) mutations and only rare TP53 mutations. BCOR, encoding an anti-apoptotic
protein, is also mutated in leukaemia25 and medulloblastoma26. Among the CIN tumours,
we observed TP53 mutations in 71% of tumours. CDH1 somatic mutations were enriched in
the genomically stable subtype (37% of cases). CDH1 germline mutations underlie
hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). However, germline analysis revealed only two
CDH1 polymorphisms, neither of which is known to be pathogenic. As in the EBV-subtype,
inactivating ARID1A mutations were prevalent in the genomically stable subtype. We

identified mutations of RHOA almost exclusively in genomically stable tumours, as
discussed below.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We analysed the patterns of base changes within gastric cancer tumours and noted elevated
rates of C to T transitions at CpG dinucleotides. We observed an elevated rate of A to C
transversions at the 3′ adenine of AA dinucleotides, especially at AAG trinucleotides, as
reported in oesophageal adenocarcinoma27. The A to C transversions were prominent in
CIN, EBV and genomically stable, but as previously observed27, not in MSI tumours
(Supplementary Fig. 3.10).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We identified RHOA mutation in 16 cases, and these were enriched in the genomically
stable subtype (15% of genomically stable cases, P = 0.0039). RHOA, when in the active
GTP-bound form, acts through a variety of effectors, including ROCK1, mDIA and Protein
Kinase N, to control actin-myosin-dependent cell contractility and cellular motility28,29 and
to activate STAT3 to promote tumorigenesis30,31. RHOA mutations were clustered in two
adjacent amino-terminal regions that are predicted to be at the interface of RHOA with
ROCK1 and other effectors (Fig. 4a, b). RHOA mutations were not at sites analogous to
oncogenic mutations in RAS-family GTPases. Although one case harboured a codon 17
mutation, we did not identify the dominant-negative G17V mutations noted in T-cell
neoplasms32,33. Rather, the mutations found in this study may act to modulate signalling
downstream of RHOA. Biochemical studies found that the RHOA Y42C mutation
attenuated activation of Protein Kinase N, without abrogated activation of mDia or
ROCK134. RHOA Y42, mutated in five tumours, corresponds to Y40 on HRAS, a residue
which when mutated selectively reduces HRAS activation of RAF, but not other RAS
effectors35. Given the role of RHOA in cell motility, modulation of RHOA may contribute
to the disparate growth patterns and lack of cellular cohesion that are hallmarks of diffuse
tumours.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Dysregulated RHO signalling was further implicated by the discovery of recurrent structural
genomic alterations. Whole genome sequencing of 107 tumours revealed 5,696 structural
rearrangements, including 74 predicted to produce in-frame gene fusions (Supplementary
Information S3.7–3.8). De novo assembly of mRNA sequencing data confirmed 170
structural rearrangements (Supplementary Information S5.4a),including two cases with an
interchromosomal translocation between CLDN18 and ARHGAP26 (GRAF). ARHGAP26 is
a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that facilitates conversion of RHO GTPases to the GDP
state and has been implicated in enhancing cellular motility34. CLDN18 is a component of
the tight junction adhesion structures36. RNA sequencing data from tumours without whole
genome sequencing identified CLDN18–ARHGAP26 fusions in 9 additional tumours, with
two more cases showing CLDN18 fusion to the homologous GAP encoded by ARHGAP6
totalling 13 cases with these rearrangements (Supplementary Table 5.6).
The fusions linked exon5 of CLDN18 toexon2 (n = 2) of ARHGAP6, to exon 10 (n = 1), or
to exon 12 (n = 10) of ARHGAP26 (Fig. 4c). As these fusions occur downstream of the
CLDN18 exon 5 stop codon, they appeared unlikely to enable translation of fusion proteins.
However, mRNA sequencing revealed a mature fusion transcript in which the ARHGAP26
or ARHGAP6 splice acceptor activates a cryptic splice site within exon 5 of CLDN18, before

the stop codon, yielding an inframe fusion predicted to maintain the transmembrane domains
of CLDN18 while fusing a large segment of ARHGAP26 or ARHGAP6 to the cytoplasmic
carboxy terminus of CLDN18. These chimaeric proteins retain the carboxy-terminal GAP
domain of ARHGAP26/6, potentially affecting ARHGAP’s regulation of RHOA and/or cell
motility. Furthermore, these fusions may also disrupt wild-type CLDN18, impacting cellular
adhesion. The CLDN18–ARHGAP fusions were mutually exclusive with RHOA mutations
and were enriched in genomically stable tumours (62%, P = 10−3) (Fig. 4d). Within the
genomically stable subtype, 30% of cases had either RHOA or CLDN18–ARHGAP
alterations. Evaluation of gene expression status in pathways putatively regulated by RHOA
using the Paradigm-Shift algorithm predicted activation of RHOA-driven pathways
(Supplementary Fig. 11.4a–c), suggesting that these genomic aberrations contribute to the
invasive phenotype of diffuse gastric cancer.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

SCNA analysis using GISTIC identified 30 focal amplifications, 45 focal deletions, and
chromosome arms subject to frequent alteration (Supplementary Figs 2.3–2.9). Focal
amplifications targeted oncogenes such as ERBB2, CCNE1, KRAS, MYC, EGFR, CDK6,
GATA4, GATA6 and ZNF217. Additionally, we saw amplification of the gene that encodes
the gastric stem cell marker CD44 and a novel recurrent amplification at 9p24.1 at the locus
containing JAK2, CD274 and PDCD1LG2. JAK2 encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase and
potential therapeutic target. CD274 and PDCD1LG2 encode PD-L1 and PDL2,immunosuppressant proteins currently being evaluated as targets to augment anti-tumour
immune response. Notably, these 9p amplifications were enriched in the EBV subgroup
(15% of tumours), consistent with studies showing elevated PD-L1expression in EBVpositive lymphoid cancers37,38. Evaluation of mRNA revealed elevated expression of JAK2,
PD-L1 and PD-L2 in amplified cases (Supplementary Fig. 2.10). More broadly, PD-L1/2
expression was elevated in EBV-positive tumours, suggesting that PD-L1/2 antagonists and
JAK2 inhibitors be tested in this subgroup. Focal deletions were identified at the loci of
tumour suppressors such as PTEN, SMAD4, CDKN2A and ARID1A. Additional GISTIC
analysis on the four molecular subtypes is detailed in Supplementary Figs 2.5–2.6.

Gene expression and proteomic analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our analysis of each of the expression platforms revealed four mRNA, five miRNA and
three RPPA clusters (Supplementary Methods S5–S7). Some expression clusters are similar
across platforms (Supplementary Methods S10) and/or have correspondence with specific
molecular subtypes. For example, mRNA cluster 1, miRNA cluster 4 and RPPA cluster 1
have substantial overlap and are strongly associated with genomically stable tumours, both
individually and as a group; the 34 cases with all three assignments were predominantly
genomically stable (20/34, P = 2 × 10−28). Similarly, mRNA cluster 3, miRNA cluster 2 and
RPPA cluster 3 are similar and are associated with the MSI subtype as agroup(12/22, P = 5
× 10−24). However, absolute correspondence between expression clusters and molecular
subtypes was not always seen. For example, RPPA cluster 3 showed moderate association
with both MSI and EBV (P = 0.018 and P = 0.038, respectively), and miRNA clusters each
had similar proportions of CIN (no associations with P < 0.05). Overall, the expression data
recapitulate features of the molecular classification, pointing to robustness of this taxonomy.

We analysed mRNA sequence data for alternative splicing events, finding MET exon 2
skipping in 82 of 272 (30%) cases, associated with increased MET expression (P = 10−24).
We also found novel variants of MET in which exons 18 and/or 19 were skipped (47/272;
17%; Supplementary Fig. 5.5). Intriguingly, the exons removed by these alterations encode
regions of the kinase domain.
Through supervised analysis of RPPA data, we observed 45 proteins whose expression or
phosphorylation was associated with the four molecular subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 7.2).
Phosphorylation of EGFR (pY1068) was significantly elevated in the CIN subtype,
consistent with amplification of EGFR within that subtype. We also found elevated
expression of p53, consistent with frequent TP53 mutation and aneuploidy in the CIN
subtype.

Integrated pathway analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We integrated SCNA and mutation data to characterize genomic alterations in known
signalling pathways, including candidate therapeutic targets (Fig. 5a, b). We focused on
alterations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and RAS and PI(3)-kinase signalling. EBVpositive tumours contained PIK3CA mutations and recurrent JAK2 and ERBB2
amplifications. Although MSI cases generally lacked targetable amplifications, mutations in
PIK3CA, ERBB3, ERBB2 and EGFR were noted, with many mutations at ‘hotspot’ sites
seen in other cancers (Supplementary Fig. 11.14). Absent from MSI gastric cancers were
BRAF V600E mutations, commonly seen in MSI colorectal cancer39. Although the
genomically stable subtype exhibited recurrent RHOA and CLDN18 events, few other clear
treatment targets were observed. In CIN tumours, we identified genomic amplifications of
RTKs, many of which are amenable to blockade by therapeutics in current use or in
development. Recurrent amplification of the gene encoding ligand VEGFA was notable
given the gastric cancer activity of the VEGFR2 targeting antibody ramucirumab40.
Additionally, frequent amplifications of cell cycle mediators (CCNE1, CCND1 and CDK6)
suggest the potential for therapeutic inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (Supplementary
Fig. 11.15).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We compared expression within each subtype to that of the other subtypes, and to nonmalignant gastric tissue (n = 29) (Supplementary Fig. 11.2). We computed an aggregate
score for each pathway of the NCI pathway interaction database41 and determined statistical
significance by comparison with randomly generated pathways (Supplementary Methods
S11). Hierarchical clustering of samples and pathways (Fig. 5c) revealed several notable
patterns, including elevated expression of mitotic network components such as AURKA/B
and E2F, targets of MYC activation, FOXM1 and PLK1 signalling and DNA damage
response pathways across all subtypes, but to a lesser degree in genomically stable tumours.
In contrast, the genomically stable subtype exhibited elevated expression of cell adhesion
pathways, including the B1/B3 integrins, syndecan-1 mediated signalling, and angiogenesisrelated pathways. These results suggest additional candidate therapeutic targets, including
the aurora kinases (AURKA/B) and Polo-like (PLK) family members. The strength of IL-12
mediated signalling signatures in EBV-positive tumours suggests a robust immune cell

presence. When coupled with evidence of PD-L1/2 overexpression, this finding adds
rationale for testing immune checkpoint inhibitors in EBV-positive gastric cancer.

Discussion
Through this study of the molecular and genomic basis of gastric cancer, we describe a
molecular classification (Fig. 6) that defines four major genomic subtypes of gastric cancer:
EBV-infected tumours; MSI tumours; genomically stable tumours; and chromosomally
unstable tumours. This classification may serveasa valuable adjunct to histopathology.
Importantly, these molecular subtypes showed distinct salient genomic features, providing a
guide to targeted agents that should be evaluated in clinical trials for distinct populations of
gastric cancer patients. Through existing testing for MSI and EBV and the use of emerging
genomic assays that query focused gene sets for mutations and amplifications, the
classification system developed through this study can be applied to new gastric cancer
cases. We hope these results will facilitate the development of clinical trials to explore
therapies in defined sets of patients, ultimately improving survival from this deadly disease.

METHODS SUMMARY
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Fresh frozen gastric adenocarcinoma and matched germline DNA samples were obtained
from 295 patients under IRB approved protocols. Genomic material and (when available)
protein were subjected to single nucleotide polymorphism array somatic copy-number
analysis, whole-exome sequencing, mRNA sequencing, miRNA sequencing, array-based
DNA methylation profiling and reverse-phase protein arrays. A subset of samples was
subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Initial analysis centred on the development of a
classification scheme for gastric cancer. Subsequent analysis identified key features from
each of the genomic/molecular platforms, looking both for features found across gastric
cancer and those characteristic of individual gastric cancer subtypes. Primary and processed
data are deposited at the Data Coordinating Center (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/

Figure 1. Molecular subtypes of gastric cancer

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, Gastric cancer cases are divided into subtypes: Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-positive (red),
microsatellite instability (MSI, blue), genomically stable (GS, green) and chromosomal
instability (CIN, light purple) and ordered by mutation rate. Clinical (top) and molecular
data (top and bottom) from 227 tumours profiled with all six platforms are depicted. b, A
flowchart outlines how tumours were classified into molecular subtypes. c, Differences in
clinical and histological characteristics among subtypes with subtypes coloured as in a, b.
The plot of patient age at initial diagnosis shows the median, 25th and 75th percentile values
(horizontal bar, bottom and top bounds of the box), and the highest and lowest values within
1.5 times the interquartile range (top and bottom whiskers, respectively). GE,
gastroesophageal.
