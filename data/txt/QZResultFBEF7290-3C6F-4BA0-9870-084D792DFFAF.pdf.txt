Abstract

Author Manuscript

Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (c-IAP1/2) play central roles in signal transduction
mediated by numerous receptors that participate in inflammatory and immune responses. In
certain pathways, such as activation of NF-κB, their degradation is a major regulatory event and is
physiologically induced by activation of receptors. Additionally, a number of synthetic
compounds have been developed that also target the c-IAPs and induce their degradation.
However, the extent of a synthetic IAP antagonist's ability to mirror the transcriptional program by
a physiological signal remains unclear. Here we take a systems approach to compare the
transcriptional programs triggered by activation of CD30, a well-characterized receptor previously
shown to induce the degradation of the c-IAPs, to SM-164, a synthetic IAP antagonist that
specifically triggers c-IAP degradation. Employing a technique that allows the specific analysis of
newly transcribed RNA, we have generated comparative transcriptome profiles for CD30

activation and SM-164 treatment. Analysis of these profiles revealed that the genes regulated by
each stimulus were not completely shared, indicating novel functions of IAP antagonists and
consequences of c-IAP1/2 degradation. The data identified a role for c-IAP1/2 in the regulation of
the ribosome and protein synthesis, which was subsequently confirmed by biological assays.
These findings expand our knowledge of the roles of c-IAP1/2 in signaling and provide insight
into the mechanism of synthetic IAP antagonists, furthering our understanding of their therapeutic

Introduction
The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins are central mediators of a divergent group of
cellular signaling pathways, largely involved in immune and inflammatory responses (1).
Two of these proteins, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (c-IAP1/2), have been
implicated as key regulators of NF-κB, a protein family comprised of five different
members that dimerize to form active transcription factors (2, 3). The best characterized NFκB dimers are p65:p50 and p52:RelB, which are often referred to as canonical and noncanonical NF-κB, respectively (4).

The canonical and non-canonical NF-κB pathways are activated by members of the tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily and play important roles in the immune
response, inflammation, and cancer (5, 6). While c-IAP1/2 have a demonstrated role in the
activation of canonical NF-κB following TNF treatment, their degradation is required to
activate the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, a signaling cascade that physiologically occurs
following activation of a limited subset of the TNF receptor superfamily that includes CD30,
CD40, and TNFR2 (7-9). Prior to stimulation, c-IAP1/2 form a complex with TNF receptor
associated factor (TRAF) 2 and TRAF3, and this complex is thought to bind and degrade the
constitutively expressed NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (10). Following ligand binding, the
receptor recruits the TRAF:c-IAP1/2 complex through the direct binding of the TRAFs. This
interaction subsequently triggers the degradation of c-IAP1/2 and results in the gradual
accumulation of NIK. NIK, in turn, begins a signaling cascade that leads to the
phosphorylation and processing of the NF-κB precursor p100 to the active NF-κB subunit
p52. The p52 moiety can dimerize with RelB to form the non-canonical NF-κB transcription
factor that subsequently regulates an incompletely defined list of genes involved in multiple
cellular processes, including the immune response (3, 4, 10, 11).
The c-IAP1/2 degradation event can be recreated experimentally using a class of synthetic,
small molecule compounds known as Smac mimetics (SMs) or IAP antagonists (12-14).
These compounds are structurally based on the IAP binding motif (IBM) of a physiological
binding partner of the IAPs known as second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/
direct inhibitor of apoptosis-binding protein with low isoelectric point (Smac/DIABLO).
These compounds bind to c-IAP1/2 and trigger their autoubiquitination and subsequent

degradation, resulting in the processing of p100 to p52 and the activation of non-canonical
NF-κB (11-15). Additionally, SM treatment has been shown to activate canonical NF-κB
under some circumstances (12, 13). While SMs have been shown to replicate aspects of
receptor activation, the extent of the functional overlap between the two classes of stimuli
remains unclear.

Author Manuscript

In the present study, we have taken a systems approach to extensively compare the
downstream effects of physiological and synthetic IAP antagonism. We utilized a cellular
system in which both receptor activation and SM treatment leads to the degradation of cIAP1/2 and results in canonical and non-canonical NF-κB activation. While stimulation of
the receptor also induced additional signaling pathways, such as JNK and ERK, SM
treatment did not, demonstrating that these pathways were independent of c-IAP1/2. To
characterize the transcriptional consequences of IAP antagonism-induced NF-κB activation,
we used Bru-seq, a technique that we have developed that specifically analyzes newly
transcribed RNA, to identify gene expression profiles following each stimulus. While
overlapping, the resulting transcriptome profiles revealed differences between the two
modes of IAP antagonism. Furthermore, analysis of the transcriptome data revealed novel
functions of c-IAP1/2 degradation and sequelae of SM treatment. One novel consequence of
c-IAP1/2 degradation was the decreased expression of genes related to the ribosome and
translation. In support of this finding, biological assays found that SM treatment resulted in
decreased protein synthesis. These findings identify novel functions for the c-IAPs, and
provide insight into the mechanism of SMs and their therapeutic potential.

Smac mimetic treatment models CD30-mediated c-IAP1/2 degradation and NF-κB
activation

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the consequences of c-IAP degradation, the effects of a Smac mimetic were
compared to that of a cell surface receptor previously shown to induce the degradation of the
c-IAPs upon activation. CD30 is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily that binds and
degrades c-IAP1/2 as part of a larger complex. CD30 is highly expressed on the surface of
certain lymphoma and leukemia cells, including anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and
Hodgkin's lymphoma cells (16, 17). In healthy individuals, CD30 expression is restricted to
a small subset of activated T and B cells, and while its physiological role remains poorly
defined, we have previously documented its ability to degrade c-IAP1/2 following activation
(11). Using a cell-based system for CD30 stimulation and the ALCL cell lines Karpas 299
and Michel (18), the consequences of Smac mimetic (SM) treatment and CD30 activation
were compared. Both stimuli resulted in the degradation of c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 (Fig. 1A,
2A) and induced the processing of p100 to p52, a widely used marker of non-canonical NFκB activation (Fig. 1B, 2A). Both CD30 stimulation and SM treatment resulted in nuclear
translocation of DNA-binding canonical and non-canonical NF-κB, as detected by
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and confirmed by supershift analysis (Fig. 1C),
indicating that SM treatment models CD30-mediated NF-κB activation. While SM treatment
has previously been shown to induce autocrine TNF production (12, 13), pretreatment with
the TNF inhibitor Enbrel did not prevent the NF-κB activation (Fig. 1D), indicating that

SM-induced NF-κB was independent of TNF. In addition to NF-κB activation, members of
the TNFR superfamily can trigger other signaling cascades, including the JNK and ERK
pathways (19). To test if SM treatment and CD30 stimulation activated these pathways,
Karpas 299 and Michel cells were briefly treated with SM or stimulated with CD30L, and
phosphorylation of JNK and ERK was assessed. While receptor stimulation activated these
pathways, SM treatment did not (Fig. 1E). Notably, inhibition of JNK and ERK did not
affect NF-κB activation, indicating that this occurred independently of CD30-mediated JNK
and ERK signaling (Fig. 1F, S1A-C). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the ability
of SM treatment to model receptor signaling is limited to activation of NF-κB.
Kinetics of NF-κB induction by receptor activation and SM treatment

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

As described above, both CD30 activation and SM treatment were found to trigger the
degradation of c-IAP1/2 and to activate canonical and non-canonical NF-κB. However, it
was unclear if these processes occurred with similar kinetics. Time course experiments were
performed with each stimulus to examine this question. Degradation of c-IAP1/2 occurred
rapidly following CD30 stimulation and SM treatment, and substantial loss of protein was
observed within 15 min of treatment in both ALCL cell lines (Fig. 2A). Additionally, both
stimuli resulted in p100 processing to the active non-canonical NF-κB subunit p52 at 3 h
(Fig. 2A), consistent with previous reports describing the delayed kinetics of non-canonical
NF-κB activation (10). Notably, CD30 appeared to be a stronger inducer of NF-κB than SM
treatment (Fig. 2). It is unclear if this observation is due to the presence of less nuclear NFκB or weaker DNA-binding activity of NF-κB following SM treatment. A non-canonical
NF-κB nuclear protein complex was detected at 3 h by EMSA (Fig. 2B-D), indicating that
CD30 stimulation and SM treatment activate non-canonical NF-κB with similar kinetics.
Activation of canonical NF-κB, however, differed between the two stimuli. CD30-mediated
canonical NF-κB occurred rapidly, being observed 15-30 min following receptor activation,
and remained observable throughout the entire time course (Fig. 2B, 2D). Conversely, SMinduced canonical NF-κB was delayed and was initially observed at 1 h (Fig. 2C, 2D).
Interestingly, the level of active canonical NF-κB triggered by SM peaked around 6 h before
decreasing throughout the remaining time points. This decrease in canonical NF-κB
coincided with activation of non-canonical NF-κB (Fig. 2C, 2D). CD30 activation and SM
treatment degrade c-IAP1/2 and activate the same NF-κB pathways, albeit with differing
rates, suggesting potential mechanistic and functional differences.
Comparison of gene regulation induced by physiological and synthetic IAP antagonism

Author Manuscript

While the ability of SMs to activate NF-κB has been previously reported (12, 13), it is not
known if this resulted in the regulation of a similar gene expression profile as receptor
signaling. To address this question, we used a recently developed technique, Bru-seq, that
allows transcriptome analysis of newly transcribed RNA (20, 21). As depicted schematically
in Figure 3A, Karpas 299 cells were treated with SM or exposed to CD30L, incubated with
bromouridine, and the bromouridine-labeled RNA was isolated and converted into cDNA
libraries for deep sequencing. In the initial analysis of the Bru-seq data, we compared the
expression of two well-characterized NF-κB gene targets: BIRC3, which encodes the c-IAP2
protein, and NFKBIA, the gene encoding IκBα (11, 20, 22). The profiles of the mapped
sequencing reads were similar for both stimuli (Fig. 3B, C), indicating that the stimuli

produced similarly processed transcripts. Transcription of both genes was induced upon
each treatment, with BIRC3 being the most highly transcribed gene in both cases (Table S1,
S2). Compared to an unstimulated sample, transcription of BIRC3 was induced 12-fold
following CD30 activation, while SM treatment resulted in a 7-fold increase in BIRC3
transcription (Fig. 3B). The Bru-seq results were mirrored by qRT-PCR experiments that
also illustrated a more robust expression of genes following CD30 stimulation. Similar to
BIRC3, expression of NFKBIA was also markedly higher following CD30L than SM (12fold increase and 7-fold increase, respectively) (Fig. 3C, Table S1, S2). Since both stimuli
degraded c-IAP1/2 to the same degree (Fig. 1A) and with similar rates (Fig. 2A, 2B), these
results indicate that the receptor may provide additional signals that strengthen the
magnitude of NF-κB activation. Interestingly, IL8, the gene encoding the interleukin-8
cytokine and a canonical NF-κB gene target (20), exhibited the second highest expression
following CD30 stimulation (12-fold increase), but was not significantly affected by SM
treatment (Fig. 3D, Table S1, S2) indicating different functional consequences of NF-κB
activation by the two stimuli. To better visualize and compare the stimuli-induced
transcriptomes, the change in transcription of genes following SM treatment was plotted
against the change in transcription of genes following CD30 activation (Fig. 3E). While
certain genes were affected by both stimuli, such as BIRC3 and NFKBIA, the transcription of
other genes, like IL8, were modified by only one of the stimuli. Collectively, these data
demonstrate that the transcriptional consequences of IAP antagonism by SM reflect aspects
of receptor-induced signaling, while also providing evidence of functional differences
between the forms of IAP antagonism.
Gene set analysis reveals novel roles for c-IAP1/2 and IAP antagonists

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The initial analysis of the transcriptome profiles generated by each stimulus highlighted the
variety of genes regulated by c-IAP1/2 degradation. Due to the initial complexity of
classifying these genes with their wide functional diversity, we performed gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) which allows for the identification of groups of genes that
exhibit similar changes in expression using gene sets that have been categorized based on
shared, biologically relevant characteristics, such as belonging to a common enzymatic
pathway or presence in the same cellular compartment (23). GSEA has advantages over
traditional strategies of gene expression analysis, including the ability to detect biologically
significant processes involving groups of genes that show only modest changes in
expression (23). Analysis of the GSEA data indicated that CD30 activation and SM
treatment collectively modulated 256 gene sets (Fig. 4A). There were 119 CD30-specific
gene sets identified (Fig. 4A, Table S3), and it was expected that CD30-specific gene sets
would be identified since the receptor activated multiple pathways that were not activated by
SM (Fig. 1). Examples of CD30-specific gene sets are shown in Figure 4B. Interestingly, 62
SM-specific gene sets were identified (Fig. 4A, Table S3) even though SM treatment was
thought to mimic receptor signaling by degrading c-IAP1/2. This suggests that the SM may
have additional, uncharacterized effects. These effects may be regulated by additional IAPs,
such as X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), which can be antagonized by SMs (12-14).
Intriguingly, the majority of the SM-specific gene sets were down-regulated by the
compound and several gene sets were functionally related to metabolism and protein
synthesis (Fig. 4C, Table S3).

The GSEA data identified 75 gene sets shared between CD30 activation and SM treatment
(Fig. 4A). Many of these gene sets were expected, as they were related to functions shared
between the two stimuli, such as regulation of NF-κB or involvement in TNFR2 and cell
death signaling cascades (Fig. 4D, Table S3). It was unexpected that there would be gene
sets significantly down-regulated by both stimuli. Functionally, many of these gene sets
involved the regulation of the ribosome and translation, with SM treatment resulting in a
more substantial down-regulation of the transcription of these genes and gene sets (Fig. 3E,
4D, Table S1, S2, S3). Experiments with a different Smac mimetic, Birinapant, did not
affect the expression of ribosomal genes to the extent of SM-164 (Fig. S2A). However,
Birinapant was a weaker inducer of c-IAP2 degradation and NF-κB activation (Fig. S2B),
suggesting that the effect on ribosomal gene expression is dependent on efficient
degradation of both c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, as well as the subsequent activation of NF-κB.
Additionally, treatment with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk abrogated the SM-induced
down-regulation of ribosomal genes (Fig. S3A), indicating a potential regulatory role for
caspases in this process. While further work is needed to elucidate the exact mechanism,
these analyses indicate that IAP antagonism by receptor activation or synthetic compound
has diverse functional consequences, including newly identified potential roles in the
regulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis.
IAP antagonism results in decreased protein synthesis

Author Manuscript

As described above, the GSEA results indicated novel roles for c-IAP1/2 in the regulation of
genes related to the ribosome and translation. To test if the observed transcriptome results
had a cellular consequence, protein synthesis was measured following CD30 activation and
SM treatment using an assay based on incorporation of a methionine analogue (24, 25).
Karpas 299 cells were treated with the designated stimulus and then incubated in Lmethionine-free medium that had been supplemented with L-methionine or the methionine
analogue L-homopropargylglycine (HPG). The incorporation of HPG was then assessed by
flow cytometry. SM treatment resulted in a measurable decrease in protein synthesis by 3 h,
and this decrease continued with longer treatment times (Fig. 5A-C, S3D). Importantly, the
decrease in protein synthesis was initially observed prior to any substantial SM-induced cell
death, but may be regulated by caspases (Fig. S3B, S3C). In contrast, CD30 activation had a
minor effect on protein synthesis at early time points and only had a substantial effect by 24
h (Fig. 5D-F, S3E). These findings indicate that IAP antagonism, in the system tested, has
an inhibitory impact on global protein synthesis, revealing a novel regulatory consequence
for c-IAP1/2 degradation and SM treatment.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

In this study, we examined the consequences of IAP antagonism on gene regulation by
physiological and synthetic stimuli, identifying genes and pathways unique to each stimulus,
as well as novel processes affected by both triggers of c-IAP1/2 degradation. One finding of
particular interest was the down-regulation of genes related to the ribosome and translation.
This observation was identified following SM treatment and CD30 activation, and resulted
in decreased protein synthesis following both stimuli, though treatment with the Smac
mimetic had an earlier observable effect on protein synthesis than CD30 stimulation, which

only became apparent at 24 h. (Fig. 5). It has been previously well established that SMs
induce death in certain cells, and that this killing is dependent on TNF (12, 13). However,
this study provides evidence that suggests an additional mechanism of SM killing. In this
model, SM triggers the degradation of c-IAP1/2 and results in the shutdown of protein
synthesis, partially mimicking the effects of cycloheximide. The lethality of TNF would
then be due, at least in part, to the inability to synthesize pro-survival proteins, similar to
established mechanisms of TNF killing (26-28).

Author Manuscript

The consequences of CD30-mediated degradation of c-IAP1/2 differed from the IAP
antagonism induced by SM treatment. CD30 activation did not exert as rapid an effect on
protein synthesis as SM treatment. Furthermore, the decrease in protein synthesis was
observed at 24 h, which coincided with previous reports of CD30-mediated cell cycle arrest
at that time point (8, 29). Since there is an established connection between cell cycle arrest
and decreased protein synthesis (30), this observation raises the intriguing possibility that cIAP1/2 may regulate cell cycle arrest through their control of protein synthesis.

Author Manuscript

As noted above, CD30 and SM affected protein synthesis at different rates, and this may be
due to several reasons, such as variable expression of CD30 on the cells, additional
pathways activated by receptor stimulation such as MAPK pathways (Fig. 1), unique genes
regulated by the receptor (Fig. 3, 4), or a combination thereof. Similarly, the unique
consequences of SM treatment may contribute to the observed differences. One particular
difference may be the mechanism of canonical NF-κB activation by CD30, which appears to
differ from SM-induced canonical NF-κB. CD30, like its close TNFR superfamily relatives,
is thought to activate NF-κB through its TRAF binding domains (29, 31, 32). However, it
has also been shown that CD30 can activate NF-κB in the absence of its TRAF binding
domains (32, 33), suggesting that CD30 may activate multiple NF-κB pathways with
undefined functions. Less is known, however, about SM-induced canonical NF-κB. Since
SM-induced canonical NF-κB appears to be due to c-IAP1/2 degradation, it may be reliant
on the accumulation of NIK, a protein normally associated with non-canonical NF-κB
activation but also has a reported ability to activate canonical NF-κB (34, 35). The potential
mechanistic difference in canonical NF-κB activation is supported by the delayed kinetics of
NF-κB activation after SM treatment (Fig. 2), possibly suggesting a reliance on the
accumulation of NIK. Furthermore, SM treatment resulted in a weaker NF-κB signal (Fig.
2), potentially indicating additional mechanistic divergence from receptor signaling.
Moreover, the canonical NF-κB activated by CD30 may be functionally distinct from the
NF-κB activated by SM, potentially explaining the unique gene regulation by each stimulus.

Author Manuscript

In addition to differences in downstream gene targets, the mechanisms of receptor-induced
and pharmacological IAP antagonism are intrinsically different. Receptor-mediated cIAP1/2 degradation occurs in parallel with TRAF2 degradation (11, 36) and is dependent on
translocation of the c-IAP:TRAF2 complex to an insoluble cellular fraction (8). In contrast,
SMs directly bind to c-IAP1/2 and selectively trigger their autoubiquitination and
subsequent degradation without degrading TRAF2 (11, 15, 37). This highlights another facet
of SMs not shared with receptor signaling that may have downstream consequences, as it
has been reported that TRAF2 overexpression can trigger p100 processing (11).
Furthermore, SMs have been shown to inhibit XIAP. While SM-induced degradation of

Oncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 April 01.

XIAP is not always observed (14), the SM may still bind and inhibit XIAP, a component in
multiple signaling pathways (38, 39), potentially resulting in cellular consequences distinct
from CD30 activation since CD30 is not thought to affect XIAP. Notably, caspase inhibition
appeared to negate SM-induced ribosomal gene regulation (Fig. S3), potentially supporting a
role for XIAP. In addition to providing insight into the functions of c-IAP1/2 in signaling,
these findings highlight unique aspects of Smac mimetics that should be useful for defining
their therapeutic value, including their regulation of protein synthesis.

pathways (KEGG, Reactome, and BioCarta) and gene ontologies (biological processes,
molecular functions, and cellular compartment). Gene sets with FDR corrected P-values
lower than 0.01 were considered to be significantly enriched and were used in the analysis.
The primary sequencing data files from this study will be submitted to the NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus upon acceptance of the manuscript.

Measurement of protein synthesis
Cells were stimulated as indicated in the figure legends. Following the designated times, the
cells were collected, and centrifuged at 100 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed,
and the cells were resuspended in L-methionine free RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with
1 mM L-methionine or HPG (50 μM final concentration), and were incubated at 37°C and
5% CO2 for 1 h. The cells were then harvested, washed with PBS, and fixed in 50% ice cold
ethanol overnight at -20°C. The samples were then processed using the Click-iT HPG Alexa
Fluor 488 Protein Synthesis Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according
to the manufacturer's instructions, and protein synthesis was measured by flow cytometry
using an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Relative rates of protein synthesis
were calculated by normalizing the treated HPG sample to the control HPG sample after
subtracting the auto-fluorescence background.

Viability assays
Following the indicated treatments, cells were harvested, washed with PBS and
subsequently resuspended in PBS with 2 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI). The cell viability of
the PI-stained cells was assessed by flow cytometry using an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).
