BACKGROUND Toxicity from neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (NT) increases morbidity and limits therapeutic efficacy in patients
with rectal cancer. The objective of this study was to determine whether specific polymorphisms in genes associated with rectal cancer response to NT were correlated with NT-related toxicity. METHODS One hundred thirty-two patients with locally advanced rectal
cancer received NT followed by surgery. All patients received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and radiation (RT), and 80 patients also received
modified infusional 5-FU, folinic acid, and oxaliplatin chemotherapy (mFOLFOX-6). Grade 3 adverse events (AEs) that occurred during 5-FU/RT and during combined 5-FU/RT þ mFOLFOX-6 were recorded. Pretreatment biopsy specimens and normal rectal tissues
were collected from all patients. DNA was extracted and screened for 22 polymorphisms in 17 genes that have been associated with
response to NT. Polymorphisms were correlated with treatment-related grade 3 AEs. RESULTS Overall, 27 of 132 patients (20%) had
grade 3 AEs; 18 patients had a complication associated only with 5-FU/RT, 3 patients experienced toxicity only during mFOLFOX-6,
and 6 patients had grade 3 AEs associated with both treatments before surgery. Polymorphisms in the genes x-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 1 (XRCC1), xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD), and tumor protein 53 (TP53)
were associated with grade 3 AEs during NT (P < .05). Specifically, 2 polymorphisms—an arginine-to-glutamine substitution at
codon 399 (Q399R) in XRCC1 and a lysine-to-glutamine substitution at codon 751 (K751Q) in XPD—were associated with increased
toxicity to 5-FU/RT (P < .05), and an arginine-to-proline substitution at codon 72 (R72P) in TP53 was associated with increased toxicity to mFOLFOX-6 (P ¼ .008). CONCLUSIONS Specific polymorphisms in XRCC1, XPD, and TP53 were associated with increased toxicity to NT in patients with rectal cancer. The current results indicated that polymorphism screening may help tailor treatment for

INTRODUCTION
Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (NT), including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and radiation therapy (RT), followed by
total mesorectal excision (TME) is the standard of care for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.1 The oncologic
benefits of this treatment approach have been well established, and patients who respond to NT achieve excellent local tumor control and low rates of recurrence.1–4 However, not all patients respond equally to NT. Approximately 33% of
patients will have no viable cancer cells in the resected surgical specimen after treatment and will have a pathologic complete response (pCR). However, other patients will have only a partial response or no response at all.3
An important limiting factor that can impede the efficacy of NT is the development of treatment-related toxicity.
Some patients tolerate therapy well with few complications, but others experience severe (grade 3) adverse events (AEs)
that cause significant morbidity. This can lead to a truncated course of therapy, limiting the full efficacy of treatment.5,6
Therefore, the ability to identify those patients most likely to develop toxicity to NT has clinical importance.

Polymorphisms Predict Toxicity in RCa/Duldulao et al

Gene polymorphisms are genetic variations that
contribute to the genetic diversity observed between individuals. They can alter the expression and function of the
encoded protein by changing a single amino acid.7,8
Recent studies suggest that specific polymorphisms in
genes related to DNA repair, drug metabolism, cell cycle
progression, cell growth, and inflammation are associated
with response to NT and that patients with different polymorphisms in these genes have different tumor
responses.9–14 We recently demonstrated that patients
with rectal cancer who harbor select polymorphisms in
the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NAD(P)H)
(MTHFR) gene, which functions in the metabolism of 5FU, and in the cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene, which regulates
cell cycle progression, are unlikely to achieve a pCR to
NT.15 Studies in breast, ovarian, prostate, lung, esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancers also have demonstrated that specific polymorphisms associated with
response to NT also predict toxicity to treatment.9,11,14,16–21 However, few studies have examined
this association in patients with rectal cancer.22,23
We studied a large cohort of rectal cancer patients
who received treatment with NT 5-FU/RT, with or without modified infusional 5-FU, folinic acid, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX-6) chemotherapy, to determine whether
specific polymorphisms correlate with NT-related
toxicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment

This study included 132 patients with stage II/III rectal
cancer who were enrolled in a multicenter clinical trial
investigating the effect of increasing the chemoradiationto-surgery time interval and adding chemotherapy
(mFOLFOX-6) during the waiting period on tumor
response (clinicaltrials.org identifier: NCT00335816).
This study was designed as a series of sequential phase 2
trials or study groups (SGs), each with a progressively longer chemoradiation-to-surgery time interval and increasing cycles of preoperative mFOLFOX-6. This study was
approved by an institutional review board at each participating institution, and by a central institutional review
board. Informed written consent was obtained from each
patient before enrollment in the trial. Patients in the current study were from 3 SGs: SG1 (n ¼ 52), SG2 (n ¼ 58),
and SG3 (n ¼ 22). Further details of patient eligibility for
this trial are presented elsewhere.24
All patients received 5-FU/RT as described previously.24 Patients in SG1 (n ¼ 52) then underwent TME
an average of 6 weeks after completing 5-FU/RT. The
Cancer

remaining patients (SG2 and SG3, n ¼ 80) received 2
(SG2) or 4 (SG3) cycles of additional chemotherapy
(mFOLFOX-6) as described previously.24 These patients
underwent TME an average of 11 weeks (SG2) and 16
weeks (SG3) after completing 5-FU/RT.
Assessment of Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation
Therapy-Related Adverse Events

An AE was defined as a complication that occurred during
5-FU/RT or mFOLFOX-6 treatment. AEs were graded
according to the Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. A severe AE was
defined as any grade 3 toxicity (grade 3 AEs) that
occurred during 5-FU/RT or mFOLFOX-6 treatment.
Severe AEs were recorded prospectively for all patients
and were compiled in a central database.
Sample Preparation and Polymorphism
Screening

Unstained, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue
blocks were retrieved from all participating institutions.
Benign colonic epithelial cells were microdissected from
the proximal resection margins of the surgical specimen a
distance >10 cm from the primary tumor. DNA was
extracted using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, Calif) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions as previously decribed.15 Standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct Sanger sequencing
were performed to detect gene polymorphisms. We examined 22 polymorphisms in 17 genes associated with DNA
repair (excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair
deficiency, complementation group 1 [ERCC1]; x-ray
repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster
cells 1 [XRCC1]; RAD23B homolog [RAD23B]; xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group A [XPA];
xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group D
[XPD]; 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase [OGG1]; and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 [PARP]), drug metabolism
(MTHFR, thymidylate synthase [TS], dihydropyrimidine
dehydrogenase [DPD], and uridine monophosphate synthetase [OPRT]), cell cycle progression (CCND1 and tumor protein 53 [TP53]), cell growth (epidermal growth
factor receptor [EGFR]), and inflammation (vascular epidermal growth factor [VEGF], interleukin 6 [IL6], and
toll-like receptor 2 [TLR2]). Primers were used to amplify
genomic sequences using established conditions (Table
1).15 All polymorphisms were confirmed by 2 independently derived PCR products.
Statistical Analysis

Univariate analysis using the chi-square test was performed to determine the association between gene

RT, mFOLFOX-6, or both therapies and to determine
the association between grade 3 AEs and clinical/pathologic factors. No adjustment for multiple comparisons
was made. A 2-sided P value  .05 indicated a significant
association.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Tumor Response

Patient characteristics and tumor response to NT for all
132 patients are listed in Table 2. More than 50% of
patients were men (n ¼ 78; 59%), and the mean age was
57 years. Most patients (n ¼ 102; 77%) had clinical stage
III disease. Of the 132 patients who received NT, 52
patients received 5-FU/RT alone, and 80 patients received
5-FU/RT plus mFOLFOX-6. Final pathology revealed
that 33 of 132 patients (25%) achieved a pCR to NT,
including 10 patients (19%) who received 5-FU/RT alone
1108

and 23 patients (29%) who received 5-FU/RT plus
mFOLFOX-6. There were no differences in clinical or
pathologic characteristics between the treatment groups
(P ¼ .22).
Rate of Adverse Events

In total, 27 of 132 patients (20%) had 43 grade 3 AEs
related to NT. Of the 27 patients who experienced an AE
grade 3, 18 patients had a complication associated only
with 5-FU/RT, 3 patients experienced toxicity only during mFOLFOX-6, and 6 patients had grade 3 AEs associated with both treatments (Table 3). The most common
AEs observed were gastrointestinal symptoms, including
diarrhea, rectal pain, severe nausea, and vomiting.
To determine whether AE rates differed according
to treatment response, we compared the rate of grade 3
AEs for patients who attained a pCR with the rate for
patients who did not have a pCR (residual disease). In
patients with a pCR (n ¼ 33), 6 (18%) had a grade 3

AE after NT, whereas 21 of 99 patients (21%) with no
pCR experienced toxicity from NT. There was no statistical difference in the rate of grade 3 AEs between patients
with or without a pCR after NT (P ¼ .81). There also was
no difference in the rate of grade 3 AEs between patients
who received 5-FU/RT alone (n ¼ 11 of 52 patients;
21%) and patients who received 5-FU/RT plus mFOLFOX-6 (n ¼ 17 of 80 patients; 21%; P ¼ 1.0).
Association of Gene Polymorphisms With
Treatment Toxicity

We examined the association of grade 3 AEs with gene
polymorphisms during NT (Table 4). Gene polymorphisms in XRCC1 (arginine-to-glutamine substitution at
codon 399 [Q399R]), XPD (arginine-to-lysine substitution at codon 751 [Q751K]), and TP53 (arginine-to-proline substitution at codon 72 [R72P]) were associated
with grade 3 AEs during NT. Specifically, we observed
that patients with the XRCC1 Q399 allele had an
increased rate of toxicity to NT compared with patients
who were homozygous for the XRCC1 R399 allele (27%
vs 5%; P ¼ .003). In addition, we observed that patients
with the XPD Q751 allele had a lower rate of grade 3
AEs to NT compared with patients who had only the
XPD K751 allele (14% vs 31%; P ¼ .02). Finally, patients
with the TP53 P72 allele had an increased rate of grade
3 AEs compared with patients who had only the TP53
R72 allele (32% vs 16%; P ¼ .05).
We next examined the association of gene polymorphisms with toxicity in each treatment arm (5-FU/RT
and mFOLFOX-6) (Table 4). Among the patients who
received 5-FU/RT (n ¼ 132), those with the XRCC1
Q399 allele had a significantly higher rate of grade 3

AEs compared with patients who had only the XRCC1
R399 allele (24% vs 5%; P ¼ .01). In addition, patients
who had only the XPD K751 allele had an increased risk
of developing grade 3 AEs to 5-FU/RT compared
with patients who had the XPD Q751 allele (27% vs
12%; P ¼ .02).
Finally, we determined whether gene polymorphisms correlated with toxicity specifically to mFOLFOX-6 (Table 4). Univariate analysis indicated that
patients with the TP53 P72 allele had an increased risk of
toxicity to mFOLFOX-6 compared with patients who
had only the TP53 R72 allele (26% vs 5%; P ¼ .008).
DISCUSSION
Severe toxicity from NT contributes to patient morbidity
and may limit the delivery and efficacy of treatment. Predictive factors may help identify patients who are at risk
for increased toxicity and, thus, guide multimodal therapy. We observed that specific polymorphisms in the
XRCC1 (Q399R), XPD (Q751K), and TP53 (R72P)
genes were associated with increased toxicity to NT in
patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. The identification of these genetic polymorphisms as predictive factors is clinically relevant, because they may help identify
patients who are more likely to develop severe AEs to NT.
Treatment regimens with the lowest risk of toxicity,
depending on these genetic factors, could then be selected,
which may increase treatment compliance and efficacy.
Gene polymorphisms have been linked to differential response to neoadjuvant therapies in lung, colon,
esophageal, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancers.9,11,13,14,16,19,20,25 Gene polymorphisms can affect

protein function and alter biologic pathways that are integral in response to NT in tumor cells.7,8 Polymorphisms
also can attenuate pathways, such as DNA damage repair,
drug metabolism, and cell cycle progression, impairing
the survival of normal cells under stress from treatment
with either RT or chemotherapy.7,8 Thus, polymorphisms may contribute to significant treatment-related
toxicity in patients.
Although little is known about the functional consequences of the XRCC1 R399Q polymorphism, previous
reports have examined its association with toxicity to RT
and/or chemotherapy in other malignancies.11,17,18,20,26
The XRCC1 protein acts as a scaffold that coordinates the
base excision repair mechanism, which repairs DNA after
damage from RT. Monaco et al described the effect of the
XRCC1 R399Q gene polymorphism on XRCC1 protein
function and observed that the R-to-Q amino acid substitution produces significant conformational changes at the
BRCT1 binding domain, which interacts with the breast
cancer 1 (BRCA1) gene during DNA damage, and
decreases protein interaction. The overall effect may result
in attenuated DNA repair, especially after RT.26 ChangClaude et al observed that patients with breast cancer who
harbored the XRCC1 R399 allele had increased acute toxicity from RT.17,18 Other studies have demonstrated that
the XRCC1 R399 allele correlates with severe AEs after
chemoradiation therapy and with an increased rate of
grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in patients with ovarian cancer
who receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy.11 In contrast,
Giachino et al demonstrated that the XRCC1 Q399 allele
was associated with a significantly increased risk of grade
1110

3 and 4 complications in patients with lung cancer who
received platinum-based chemotherapy.20 Our results
support the later association of the XRCC1 Q399 allele
with the development of severe toxicity to NT in patients
with rectal cancer. In our study, the XRCC1 Q399 allele
was strongly associated with toxicity during 5-FU/RT
treatment.
The XPD protein is a DNA helicase involved in the
nucleotide excision repair pathway. Monaco et al reported
that the XPD K751Q polymorphism results in a conformational change in the C-terminal of the XPD protein.27
The C-terminal is responsible for the activation of XPD
helicase during DNA repair, and it also affects the interaction with other proteins involved in DNA repair. Previous
studies have demonstrated contrasting roles for the XPD
K751 and Q751 alleles.28,29 Our results, which demonstrated an increased risk of AEs among patients with the
XPD K751 allele, are in agreement with the results of
Boige et al, who previously reported increased toxicity in
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had the
XPD K751 allele and received 5-FU-based regimens.16
Homozygosity of the XPD K751 allele may result in attenuated XPD function and diminished response to DNA
damage. This may further lead to decreased DNA damage
repair in normal cells after chemoradiation and may result
in treatment toxicity. Other studies also support the association of the XPD K751 allele with an increased risk of
toxicity from RT in patients with lung cancer.9,30
Mutations in the TP53 gene have been well studied,
but genetic polymorphisms in the TP53 gene have only
recently been evaluated and have been associated with an

increased risk of cancers of the stomach, breast, lung, and
esophagus.31–33 Studies have demonstrated that the TP53
R72 allele may encode a TP53 variant that increases the
induction of programmed cell death.34 However, in cancer
cells, the effectiveness of the TP53 R72 allele in promoting
cell death may depend on the mutation status of the TP53
gene.35,36 Specifically, the proapoptotic effects of the TP53
R72 allele may be lost when an inactivating TP53 gene
mutation is present. This has been described in 70% of
patients with nonmelanoma skin cancers.37 However, few
studies have examined the role of the TP53 R72P polymorphism in determining toxicity to chemoradiation therapy.
Khrunin et al observed an increased risk of severe neutropenia in women with ovarian cancer who were homozygous
for the TP53 P72 allele and received platinum-based chemotherapy.11 These findings are consistent with our results,
which demonstrate an association of the TP53 P72 allele
with toxicity to NT, especially in patients who receive
mFOLFOX-6. Further studies may be necessary to investigate the association of the TP53 R72P polymorphism with
toxicity to platinum-based regimens.
Screening patients for specific gene polymorphisms
that may predict toxicity to different components of NT
could help tailor the management of patients with rectal
cancer. Specifically, patients who carry polymorphisms
associated with chemoradiation toxicity may benefit from
a chemotherapy-based approach (mFOLFOX-6) and
avoid RT. In addition, patients who harbor polymorphisms associated with platinum-based toxicity may be
spared unnecessary morbidity by selecting nonplatinumcontaining regimens. This potential impact on the clinical
decision-making process must be weighed against the limitations of our study. First, our cohort size was relatively
small with heterogeneity in the mFOLFOX-6 regimen.
Consequently, we support validation of our results in a
larger series of patients who are treated within the confines
of a prospective trial. Second, our clinical trial consisted of
3 different treatment groups, and it is feasible that our
current investigation was underpowered to detect small
differences between groups. Finally, our list of polymorphisms was extensive, but not exhaustive. Other polymorphisms that were not assessed in this study also may be
associated with treatment toxicity. Future sequencing of
the whole genome may identify other polymorphisms
associated with specific outcomes.
In conclusion, polymorphisms in the XRCC1, XPD,
and TP53 genes may predict the development of severe
AEs in patients with rectal cancer who are receiving NT.
Screening for these polymorphisms before treatment may
help identify patients who are at increased risk of developCancer

ing toxicity to treatment. This may help guide clinicians
in choosing the optimal treatment regimen by individualizing therapeutic regimens for maximum efficacy with
minimal morbidity. By screening patients for the presence
of these genetic markers, we may increase the likelihood
that patients who are recommended for NT can tolerate
and complete therapy and will receive the maximal benefit
from treatment.
