Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Alveoli are gas-exchange sacs lined by squamous alveolar type (AT) 1 cells and cuboidal,
surfactant-secreting AT2 cells. Classical studies suggested AT1 arise from AT2 cells, but recent
studies propose other sources. Here we use molecular markers, lineage tracing, and clonal analysis
to map alveolar progenitors throughout the mouse lifespan. We show that during development
AT1 and AT2 cells arise directly from a bipotent progenitor, whereas after birth new AT1 derive
from rare, self-renewing, long-lived, mature AT2 cells that produce slowly expanding clonal foci
of alveolar renewal. This stem cell function is broadly activated by AT1 injury, and AT2 selfrenewal is selectively induced by EGF ligands in vitro and oncogenic KrasG12D in vivo, efficiently
generating multifocal, clonal adenomas. Thus, there is a switch after birth, when AT2 cells
function as stem cells that contribute to alveolar renewal, repair, and cancer. We propose that local
signals regulate AT2 stem cell activity: a signal transduced by EGFR-KRAS controls self-renewal
and is hijacked during oncogenesis, while another signal controls reprogramming to AT1 fate.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Pulmonary gas exchange occurs in delicate alveolar sacs lined by two epithelial cell types1
(Extended Data Figure 1). Squamous alveolar type (AT) 1 cells mediate gas exchange,
whereas cuboidal AT2 cells secrete surfactant that prevents alveolar collapse; AT2 cells are
one of the medically most important cells in the neonate and, as described below, one of the
most dangerous in adults. Serious diseases including Respiratory Distress Syndrome and
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis involve a failure to establish or maintain AT1 and AT2 cells,
and alveoli are a major site of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death2.

Despite their importance, the identity of alveolar progenitor and stem cells is controversial
and their activity throughout life uncharted3,4. Classical morphologic and radioautographic
studies in rodents suggested that during development progenitors mature into AT2 cells,
some of which differentiate into AT1 cells5. Maintenance is difficult to study because of
slow turnover6,7, but lineage tag expression in isolated AT1 cells is observed following bulk
labeling of AT2 cell populations8,9. To circumvent slow turnover, lung injury models have
been employed, and provide evidence that AT2 cells can contribute to alveolar repair8,10,11.
Currently, six different cell populations have been proposed as alveolar stem cells based on
their capacity for clonal propagation and multilineage differentiation in culture9,12–14.
Transplantation assays have also been employed, but because many cells are implanted they
cannot assess whether individual cells self-renew and undergo multilineage
differentiation4,15. When one of these putative stem cell populations was fate-mapped in
vivo, it failed to demonstrate the multilineage differentiation achieved in culture16; similar
disparity between ex vivo and in vivo behavior of putative stem cells has been found for
other organs17. Here we use a battery of alveolar markers, lineage tracing, and clonal
analysis in mice to identify alveolar progenitor and stem cells in vivo and map their locations
and activity during lung development, maintenance, and cancer.

AT1 and AT2 cells arise independently during development from a bipotent
progenitor
Mature AT1 and AT2 cells appear about one day before birth, when distal tubules begin to
dilate (“sacculation”, Figure 1b–d)18,19. We mapped progression of sacculation in three
dimensions by analyzing finely staged whole mount lungs immunostained for E-Cadherin
(Cdh1) to visualize individual cells (Figure 1a–c and Extended Data Figure 1e–f). Dilation
begins at the bronchoalveolar junction then progresses distally towards the airway tip
(Figure 1a–c).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The classical model proposing that progenitors in development are pre-AT2 cells is difficult
to reconcile with the finding that some AT1 cell markers are expressed up to five days
before sacculation20. To molecularly classify progenitors, we validated 15 extant AT1 and
AT2 markers (Supplementary Table 1) then analyzed the transition in labeling between
distal (progenitors) and proximal (nascent AT1 and AT2 cells) positions in a sacculating
airway (Figure 1d) to infer dynamic expression changes during differentiation (Figure 1e–p).
Markers fell into six expression classes (Extended Data Table 1) distinguishing seven stages
in alveolar development (Figure 1e–p). However, instead of a progenitor-AT2-AT1
progression, our data support a model in which bipotent progenitors (P) expressing a subset
of AT1 (1) and AT2 (2) markers (P1E, P1L, P2E, P2L) give rise to either AT1 or AT2 cells
by shutting off inappropriate cell type markers early (E) or late (L) in differentiation, then
turning on cell type-specific late (L) markers (A1L, A2L) as they complete maturation
(Figure 1q). Co-expression of AT1 and AT2 markers by progenitors suggests that these
specialized cell types may have evolved from a primordial pneumocyte with features of
both, like those in lower vertebrates21.
Three additional lines of evidence support the bipotent progenitor model. First, clonal
analysis of individual distal airway epithelial tip cells22 labeled on embryonic day (E) 15

using an inducible Cre recombinase (Shh-Cre-ER) demonstrated localized alveolar lineage
clusters with marked AT1 and AT2 cells (Extended Data Figure 2a,b), confirming that
individual cells are bipotent. Second, ultrastructural analysis of early sacculation revealed
three classes of distal epithelial cells (Figure 1r–u): cuboidal cells with glycogen vacuoles
but no lamellar bodies (bipotent progenitors); cuboidal cells with vacuoles and lamellar
bodies (early AT2 cells); and partially flattened cells with vacuoles (early AT1 cells). We
never observed partially flattened cells with lamellar bodies, the presumed AT2-to-AT1
intermediate predicted by the classical model (Extended Data Figure 1g). Third, lineage
tracing of newly-differentiated AT2 cells using a Cre recombinase knock-in (LysM-Cre) at
the LysozymeM (Lyz2) locus, a late AT2 marker gene (A2L), labeled many AT2 cells in the
embryo but no marked AT1 cells were seen by two weeks postnatally (Extended Data
Figure 2c,e).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Little epithelial proliferation was detected during sacculation and for several weeks
afterward (Extended Data Figure 3), suggesting that maturation of bipotent progenitors
generates most or perhaps all AT1 and AT2 cells in development. Flow cytometry at early
sacculation (E18.1) showed bipotent progenitors or pre-AT2 cells (Muc1+/Pdpn+) comprised
8% of distal cells, while early or mature AT2 cells (Muc1+/Pdpn−) made up 5%. Bipotent
progenitors appear to be fully exhausted by postnatal day four, when sacculation has
completed throughout the lung. In adult lungs few if any bipotent progenitors were found by
flow cytometry (0.3%+/−0.2% Muc1+/Pdpn+ distal epithelial cells) or labeling with ShhCre-ER, suggesting a transition to other sources.

Alveolar maintenance by infrequent activation of AT2 cells in discrete foci

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Classical radioautographic studies suggested alveolar epithelium is a slowly renewing
population maintained by diffuse proliferation, presumably of AT2 cells23. We used in vivo
lineage tracing to investigate the role of AT2 cells in maintenance, marking them in two
complementary ways, with similar results. In one, a Cre-ERT2-rtTA knock-in at Surfactant
Protein C (SftpC) locus (SftpC-Cre-ER) was used with a membrane-localized fluorescent
reporter (mTmG) to pulse-label AT2 cells by tamoxifen induction at postnatal (PN) 18 days;
mice were analyzed 13 or 210 days later. Although SftpC is often used as a mature AT2
marker, the results above (Extended Data Table 1) show that as a class P2E marker it is also
expressed by the bipotent progenitor. Hence, we also labeled AT2 cells using LysM-Cre
described above, a class A2L marker that initiates expression only in mature AT2 cells
(Extended Data Figure 4a,b,d,m). Both lines robustly labeled AT2 cells throughout the lung,
and at 2 months after marking (SftpC-Cre-ER) or postnatally (LysM-Cre) showed scattered
AT1 cells labeled with the AT2 lineage tag (Extended Data Figure 2d,f and Extended Data
Figure 5). AT2 cells did not significantly contribute to renewal of bronchiolar lineages
including Clara, ciliated, and neuroendocrine cells (Extended Data Figure 4c,e–m), and
although rare cells near bronchoalveolar junctions that co-expressed SftpC and Clara cell
marker CCSP/Scgb1a1 were also tagged (“bronchioalveolar stem cells” or BASCs12), they
proliferated little if at all (Extended Data Figure 4f–h,j–m).
To investigate the frequency and spatial localization of AT1 renewal by AT2 cells, we
labeled lungs as above using LysM-Cre and analyzed them at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 months of

age. Less than 1% of AT1 cells expressed the AT2 lineage tag at 1 month, 3.9% at 4 months
and 7.5% at 16 months. AT1 cell replacement occurred preferentially in alveoli abutting
arterioles and in the lung periphery (Figure 3a,b). Wherever new AT1 cells arose, the
alveolus was replaced essentially in half or its entirety, suggesting alveoli include just one or
two AT1 cells. With aging, adjacent alveolar units were also renewed, evidenced by slowly
enlarging clusters of AT1 cells marked with the AT2 lineage tag (Figure 2a–c). These
patches of AT1 replacement were indistinguishable from surrounding areas, except for AT1
labeling with the AT2 lineage tag; similar results obtained with SftpC-Cre-ER (Extended
Data Figure 5). We conclude that AT1 replacement by AT2 cells occurs intermittently and
in a spatially patchy distribution in “renewal foci” that slowly enlarge over time, with
perivascular and peripheral regions serving as relative “hot spots.”

Renewal foci derive from single, differentiated AT2 cells with stem cell
properties

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Each renewal focus could derive from a single AT2 cell, in which case the cells would be
clonally related, or from multiple AT2 cells. To distinguish these possibilities, we used a
Confetti Cre-dependent reporter that stochastically expresses one of four fluorescent
proteins in each cell that undergoes recombination. We analyzed the membrane CFP lineage
marker and found that foci were similar in size and progressive enlargement to those
observed using the single color reporter, indicating renewal foci derive from a single
“founder” AT2 cell. Because of fortuitously inefficient recombination of the Confetti
reporter using LysM-Cre (~2% of AT2 cells expressed mCFP at 16 months), we were able
to distinguish marked AT2 cells within renewal foci. Most contained one or two AT2 cells
and multiple AT1 cell progeny colonizing up to six contiguous alveoli (Figure 2d–f). We
also observed small clonal foci comprised only of AT2 cells (Extended Data Figure 6b,c),
implying they are capable of self-renewing without forming AT1 cells (self-duplication).
Founder AT2 cells expressed mature AT2 markers including LAMP-1, a lysosomeassociated protein, suggesting they continue to produce surfactant (Extended Data Figure
6a), and they didn't express Clara, ciliated, and neuroendocrine markers. Their only
distinguishing feature was their nucleus, which was often slightly larger and stained more
intensely for Nkx2.1 than nearby AT2 cells (see also Figure 2d,e). We conclude that each
renewal focus derives from a single, self-renewing AT2 cell that can generate multiple AT1
and/or AT2 cells, is long-lived, and remains closely associated with its progeny, as
evidenced by its persistence in large foci at advanced ages (Figure 2e). Because founder
cells appear to be mature (LysM-Cre lineage positive), functional (SftpC-Cre-ER lineage
and LAMP-1 positive) AT2 cells that share the essential properties of conventional stem
cells (multipotent, self-renewing, persist for life), they are “bi-functional” stem cells,
executing both differentiated and regenerative functions.

Rapid and extensive alveolar repair by AT2 cells induced by acute AT1 cell

renewed AT1 cells (Figure 3c–e). This finding shows that AT2 cells become activated
following hyperoxic injury, and supports the idea that although normally only a rare subset
of AT2 cells executes a stem cell function, others can be recruited to repair alveolar damage.
Whether every AT2 cell can be activated this way could not be determined because more
severe hyperoxia was lethal.

Oncogenic KrasG12D activates AT2 self-renewal and efficiently transforms
AT2 cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Adenocarcinoma, the major form of lung cancer, is associated with activating mutations in
Kras or Egfr25. Typically located in peripheral lung regions, nearly all tumor cells express
SftpC, leading to long-standing speculation that they originate from AT2 cells or their
progenitors. However, the identity of the tumor initiating cell(s) remains
controversial12,26–28. To test the effect of oncogenic KrasG12D on mature AT2 cells, a
conditional KrasLSL-G12D allele was activated using LysM-Cre along with the mTmG Credependent reporter. Tumor nodules grew rapidly throughout the lungs (Figure 4a–d), with
dense replacement of virtually the entire alveolar region by one month after induction and
death shortly thereafter (Figure 4e). When lungs were examined in the first few days
following induction, we found with a Rainbow multi-color reporter that nearly every
epithelial cell expressing the AT2 lineage tag proliferated, demonstrating highly efficient
AT2 transformation by KrasG12D (Figure 4f–i). The biggest tumors were found in peripheral
and perivascular regions, sites where physiological AT1 renewal by AT2 cells was
commonly observed (compare Figures 3a,b and 4o,p). Similar results obtained using SftpCCre-ER to activate KrasG12D in adult mice (Extended Data Figure 7a,c). By contrast, when
we used CCSP-Cre-ER, most Clara cells were unaffected or divided minimally, whereas
some at bronchoalveolar junctions formed small clonal adenomas (Extended Data Figure
7b). We also used ubiquitously expressed ROSA-Cre-ER to activate the KrasG12D allele at
random, resulting in many singlets and minimally affected cells throughout the lung, even
18 days after induction (Figure 4j). The transformed AT2 cells comprising the adenomas
continued to express AT2 markers (Nkx2.1, SftpD) and did not turn on a Clara marker
(CCSP) or, with rare exceptions, AT1 markers (Pdpn, LEL) (Extended Data Figure 8). Thus,
oncogenic KrasG12D appears to selectively and permanently induce AT2 self-renewal,
without deprogramming the cells to the bipotent progenitor or causing reprogramming to
AT1 or Clara cell fates.
By examining lineage-tagged KrasG12D mutant lungs at progressive stages, we could infer
the cellular mechanism of adenoma formation (Figure 4k–m). Proliferation of the activated
AT2 cell generates daughter cells that spread laterally yet maintain a monolayer (“lepidic”
expansion), the first histological sign of the tumor (Figure 4l). Later, cells heap up and form
a nodule (“hilical” expansion) that obliterates the lumen and begins compressing and
invading adjacent alveoli (Figure 4m). Infrequent clones developed into large, well-formed
papillary structures, though most formed simple adenomas29. At advanced stages, a striking
pattern of large, closely-packed, single color tumors was evident, implying minimal cellular
exchange between neighboring tumor foci (Figure 4i). Some advanced tumors became
infiltrated by macrophage “nests” (Figure 4n), a poor prognostic sign30.

EGF signaling controls self-renewal of AT2 cells in culture
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We profiled the transcriptome of bipotent progenitors and AT2 cells. Both express Egfr, two
other EGFR family members (Erbb2, Erbb3) (Supplementary Table 2), and receptors for
many other signals (Supplementary Table 2,3). Purified AT2 cells (Figure 3f) retain a robust
ability to both proliferate (>25% Ki67-positive, Figure 3g,j) and to differentiate into AT1like cells (>95% thin, flat morphology and Aquaporin 5-positive, n=240 cells) (Extended
Data Figure 6d). Addition of purified EGF ligands (TGFα, HB-EGF, NRG1) stimulated
AT2 proliferation, whereas EGFR blocking antibody inhibited proliferation (Figure 3h–j).
None of these treatments induced differentiation into AT1 cells. Thus, EGF signaling is a
critical and selective regulator of AT2 proliferation, at least under these conditions.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our characterization of alveolar progenitor and stem cells throughout the lifespan supports a
model in which AT1 and AT2 cells arise independently during development from a bipotent
progenitor (Figure 5a). Several weeks after birth, when alveolar development is complete,
there is a switch and mature AT2 cells become a renewable source of AT1 and AT2 cells.
But these postnatal renewal events are rare and occur in monoclonal foci (“alveolar renewal
focus”, Figure 5b) that slowly expand over months or years. Only a small fraction (~1%) of
mature AT2 cells normally express this stem cell function and they divide intermittently
(~40 day doubling time) and supply only local domains, giving an overall renewal rate of
just 7% of alveoli per year. This stem cell function is more broadly induced by AT1 injury,
indicating that other AT2 cells may have similar potential (“alveolar repair focus”, Figure
5b) that can be activated by dying AT1 cells. Classical pneumonectomy experiments support
the idea that most AT2 cells possess latent regenerative capacity31, and AT2 ablation
induces self-duplication of surviving AT2 cells9 (“AT2 replacement focus”). Our data do not
exclude alternative sources of new alveolar cells, especially following severe injuries14 that
regionally deplete AT2 cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

If many or all AT2 cells can serve as stem cells, why does only a minority execute this
function for maintenance, producing large monoclonal foci? Perhaps alveolar turnover is
coupled with a stem cell hierarchy whereby an initially activated AT2 cell suppresses nearby
AT2 cells and becomes the dominant stem cell. It is also unclear why renewal foci slowly
enlarge over time, since there is no obvious recurrent injury. Perhaps foci are programmed
anatomical domains of alveolar renewal, with new cells moving out from a specialized niche
akin to intestinal crypts albeit with much slower turnover. Whatever the explanation, there
are clearly regional influences as both renewal and tumor foci are preferentially located in
perivascular and peripheral lung domains, possible sources of stem cell signals32.
EGFR signaling selectively stimulates proliferation of AT2 cells in vitro, and oncogenic
KrasG12D permanently and selectively activates proliferation in vivo, efficiently
transforming AT2 cells into rapidly growing monoclonal tumors (“lung tumor focus”,
Figure 5b). By virtue of their large numbers, class susceptibility, and robust adenomatous
response to KrasG12D, AT2 cells may constitute the major cell type responsible for human
lung adenocarcinoma, making them among the most dangerous cells in the body.

We propose that the oncogenic potential of AT2 cells is a direct consequence of their stem
cell function: AT2 cells are poised to function as alveolar stem cells and EGFR/KRAS
signaling regulates the self-renewal part of the stem cell program (and the related process of
self-duplication); another signaling pathway (Supplementary Table 2) must control AT2
reprogramming to AT1 fate (Figure 5a). This model predicts that dying AT1 cells secrete an
EGF that initiates self-renewal, plus another signal for fate reprogramming. Dying AT2 cells
presumably produce only the former. It will be important to identify these signals and the
events they control. This could suggest new strategies for early detection and treatment of
tumors and for replenishing diseased alveoli.

Methods
Mouse strains

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CD1 or B6 (Charles River Laboratories) were the wild type strains. The Cre recombinase
system was used to manipulate gene and marker expression in vivo in specific mouse lung
cell types and lineages in mixed strain backgrounds, using a knock-in allele that expresses
Cre or a tamoxifen-inducible Cre-Estrogen Receptor (ER or ERT2) fusion crossed to a Credependent target gene. For Cre-ER lines, tamoxifen (Sigma) was dissolved in corn oil by
sonication, stored in 100 ul aliquots at −80°C, and 1 mg (Rosa26-Cre-ERT2, CCSP-CreER), 2 or 4 mg (Shh-Cre-ERT2) or 1, 2, or 3 mg (SftpC-Cre-ERT2-rtTA) injected
intraperitoneally at specified ages to induce recombination in cells throughout the transgene
expression domain. The Cre expression strains used were: Shh-Cre35, which recombines
throughout the endoderm-derived lung epithelium from the beginning of lung development;
Shh-Cre-ERT235 expressed in early lung endoderm then restricts to distal tip epithelium
during branching morphogenesis22; LysM-Cre36 expressed in mature AT2 cells,
macrophages, and neutrophils; SftpC-Cre-ERT2-rtTA4 expressed in the bipotent alveolar
progenitor and developing and mature AT2 cells, as well as in rare bronchiolar cells; CCSPCre-ER16 expressed in Clara cells and rare SftpC-expressing bronchiolar cells; and, and
Rosa26-Cre-ERT237 expressed throughout the lung and rest of the body. The Cre-responsive
target genes used were: R26-EYFP38, a ubiquitously expressed transgene that expresses
EYFP following Cre recombination; R26-mTmG39, which expresses membrane-targeted
tdTomato before recombination and membrane-targeted EGFP after recombination; R26Confetti40, which expresses either RFP, EYFP, nuclear GFP, or membrane CFP after
recombination; R26-tdTomato41, which expresses tdTomato after recombination; and R26Rainbow42, which expresses GFP before recombination and either CFP, mOrange, or
mCherry after recombination. KrasLSL-G12D is a knock-in at the Kras locus in which the
wild type Kras coding sequence is replaced by a lox-STOP-lox-KrasG12D allele34, which
following Cre recombination results in endogenously regulated expression of a
constitutively-active KRAS protein. LysM-EGFP43 is an EGFP knock-in at the Lyz2 locus
expressed by mature AT2 cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Genotyping was performed
by PCR of DNA extracted from ear clips using the Red-Xtract Kit (Sigma) and published
primer sets. Mice were housed in filtered cages and all experiments were performed in
accordance with approved IACUC protocols.

Hyperoxic lung injury

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

8 week old female mice were housed in a sealed Plexiglas chamber with oxygen delivered
by continuous flow to maintain levels at 88% for five days, after which the animals were
returned to room air to recover for three weeks before analyzing. Female siblings maintained
under room air were used as controls. AT1 cell renewal was quantitated as described below
by blinded scoring of the number of alveoli in which AT1 cells expressed the AT2 cell
lineage label in three randomly selected lung volumes (100–300 um thick lung slices in
randomly selected 20x fields) from two animals per group.
Lung collection, fixation, and processing
Embryos were staged by vaginal plugging of the mother, with noon on the day of
appearance of the plug taken as embryonic day (E) 0.5. Individual embryos were also staged
by fetal crown-rump length at time of sacrifice. Lungs were removed en bloc and a scalpel
used to excise the tip of the accessory lobe, after which lungs and the tip were fixed in
methanol:DMSO (4:1) with rocking overnight at 4°C, bleached in methanol:DMSO:30%
H202 (4:1:1) for 5 hours at room temperature, then dehydrated and stored in methanol at
−20°C until staining.

Postnatal mice were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation, the abdominal aorta severed,
and sternotomy performed. Phosphate buffered saline (PBS; Ca2+- and Mg2+-free, pH 7.4)
was gently perfused into the right ventricle by manual pressure using a syringe with a 21
gauge needle to clear the pulmonary vasculature. For mice up to 7 days old, lungs were
removed en bloc, the accessory lobe tip excised, lobes separated and trimmed to create a flat
base, glued to a tissue disk with cyanoacrylate, then submerged in ice cold PBS and sliced at
a thickness of 50 to 250 um using a vibrating microtome (Leica). Lung slices were fixed in
methanol:DMSO as above. For direct imaging without immunostaining, slices were fixed in
PFA (2% in PBS) overnight at 4°C then stored in Vectashield (Vector) at 4°C.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For mice 8 days or older, lungs were collected and processed as above except that following
clearance of the pulmonary vasculature the ventral trachea was incised and cannulated with
a blunt needle that was secured in place by tying a suture around the trachea. Lungs were
then gently inflated to full capacity with molten low melting point agarose (Sigma, 2% in
PBS) after which the cannula was withdrawn and the suture tightened to prevent leakage.
Ice-cold PBS was dripped into the thorax to solidify the agarose, then the inflated lungs
were removed en bloc and processed as above.
Lungs from mice carrying the Rainbow transgene were cleared and inflated as above,
immersion fixed in PFA (4% in PBS) overnight at 4°C, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose
overnight at 4°C, then submerged in OCT (Tissue Tek) in an embedding mold, frozen on
dry ice, and stored at −80°C. Sections of 10 and 30 μm obtained using a cryostat (Leica
CM3050S) were collected on glass slides, mounted in Prolong Gold (Invitrogen) and stored
at 4°C after curing at room temperature overnight. Lungs for tumor histology were collected
without perfusion, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, then sections obtained using a
microtome were collected on glass slides, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and
mounted.

NEL741001KT). Primary antibodies raised in mouse were detected using the Mouse-onMouse Kit (Vector). For lung slices, secondary antibodies conjugated to an Alexa fluor dye
(A488, A555, or A633; Invitrogen) were used. DAPI (5 ng/ml) was included during
incubation with secondary antibodies. Staining with biotin-conjugated lectins was performed
as described for primary antibodies then detected with streptavidin conjugated to an Alexa
fluor dye (Invitrogen).

containing partially sacculated airway tips were identified. Specimens were visualized with
a transmission electron microscope (Jeol TEM1230) and images captured with a CCD
camera then processed using Adobe Photoshop. Individual epithelial cells were scored for
the presence or absence of glycogen vacuoles, lamellar bodies, and cuboidal versus
attenuated morphology.
Assigning alveolar cell marker classes

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Each of the alveolar antigens and lectins was identified by systematically searching the
published literature using PubMed. We then purchased all antibodies and lectins from our
list that were commercially available and tested their expression in the adult lung against the
canonical markers of AT1 (T1α/Pdpn) and AT2 (pro-SftpC) cells. In cases where we could
not perform double-labeling with a canonical marker because the antisera were raised in the
same species, we compared expression against other markers we had already validated that
were raised in a different species. For AT1 markers that co-localized with Pdpn, we further
attempted to confirm these were not also expressed by endothelial or AT2 cells by directly
comparing their expression against anti-GFP in lung slices from Shh-Cre> mTmG mice,
which provides pan-epithelial membrane marking. In total, we tested 77 antibodies raised
against 48 antigens and seven lectins for robustness of signal, then for AT1 or AT2 selective
marking. We then analyzed the expression patterns of our panel of validated AT1 and AT2
cell markers in alveolar progenitors at the E17 accessory lobe tip, which we selected because
its distinctive shape provides reliable landmarks for identifying the same airway position in
different lung specimens. Only two expression profiles were observed, absent or ubiquitous.
Of those expressed ubiquitously, each progenitor cell would subsequently selectively
downregulate either the AT1 or the AT2 subset, distinguishing pre- or early AT2 or AT1
cells, respectively. We designated these marker classes P1E, P2E, P1L, and P2L, based on the
specificity and relative timing of their restriction (initial expression in Progenitors (P) with
restriction to AT1 (1) or AT2 (2) cells Early (E) or Late (L) in the differentiation process).
Next, the AT1 and AT2 markers that were absent in progenitors at E17 initiated selective
expression in nascent AT1 or AT2 cells at E18, so we designated these two classes A1L and
A2L (initial expression in AT1 (1) or AT2 (2) cells, Late (L) onset of expression). Classes
were assigned based on analysis of five terminal airways (100 cells) for each developmental
stage indicated.

Quantitation of AT1 cell renewal
20x alveolar fields were randomly selected and scored for the presence and extent of AT1
cell labeling by GFP. An alveolar unit with at least half of the epithelial AT1 surface marked
by the lineage tag was considered labeled, and contiguous extension of the tag into adjacent
alveoli was considered part of the same focus. All scoring was performed with blinding to
the experimental condition (for hyperoxia versus room air) and age (for clonal analysis).
Percent of alveoli labeled was determined by counting the number of positive alveoli in a
given volume of tissue then dividing by the total number of alveoli scored, with the latter
estimated by assuming a cuboidal shape and average diameter of 75 um per alveolus.

Bipotent progenitor and AT2 cell isolation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To quantify alveolar progenitor populations and isolate bipotent progenitors for expression
profiling, E18 lungs from a single litter (~6 embryos) were removed en bloc without
perfusion and a scalpel used to collect peripheral lobe edges enriched for alveolar cells.
Lung tissue was rinsed briefly in PBS, minced with a razor blade into 1 mm3 fragments,
suspended in 5 ml of digestion buffer consisting of Elastase (3 U/mL; Worthington
Biochemical Corporation) and DNase I (0.33 U/mL; Roche) in DMEM/F12, incubated with
frequent agitation at 37 °C for 45 minutes, triturated briefly with a 5 ml pipette, then an
equal volume of DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin (1
U/mL, Thermo Scientific) was added and the cell suspension passed through a 100 μm mesh
filter (Fisher) to remove residual tissue fragments, then centrifuged at 400 × g for 10
minutes. The pelleted cells were resuspended and incubated in red blood cell lysis buffer
(BD Biosciences) for 2 minutes, passed through a 40 μm mesh filter (Fisher), centrifuged at
400 × g for 10 minutes, then resuspended in sorting buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.05%
BSA and 2 mM EDTA). Antibodies against Muc1 (hamster, Thermo Scientific HM-1630P1ABX; 1:100) conjugated using Alexa Fluor A488 Antibody Labeling Kit (Life
Technologies A-20181), PE-conjugated Pdpn (hamster, eBiosciences 12-5381-80, clone
eBio8.1.1; 1:100), and Sytox Blue cell viability stain (Invitrogen) were added and the cells
incubated for 15 minutes, after which cell populations were quantified by flow cytometry
(Aria II, BD Biosciences) and viable Muc1+/Pdpn+ progenitors sorted directly into cell lysis
buffer for RNA isolation.
To isolate LysM-lineage AT2 cells for expression profiling, adult (PN70) LysM-Cre>
tdTomato mice were euthanized and pulmonary vasculature perfused clear (described
above). The trachea was cannulated with a 20 gauge needle and lungs gently inflated with
digestion buffer, then removed en bloc and lobes individually rinsed briefly in PBS, minced,
suspended in digestion buffer, and a cell suspension prepared (described above). A PEconjugated antibody against EpCAM (rat, eBiosciences 12-5791-81, clone G8.8; 1:100) was
added and after incubation, EpCAM+/Tomato+ AT2 cells were sorted by FACS directly into
cell lysis buffer for RNA isolation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To isolate AT2 cells for culturing, a cell suspension (generated as above) from adult (PN50)
B6 mouse lung was depleted of CD45+ cells using a magnetic-activated cell sorter (MACS,
Miltenyi Biotec) and CD45 microbeads (rat monoclonal, 30F11.1, Miltenyi Biotech
130-052-301) according to manufacturer instructions, incubated with a biotinylated antibody
against EpCAM (rat, eBiosciences 13-5791-81; clone G8.8), then enriched for EpCAM+
cells using streptavidin-coated microbeads (Miltenyi Biotech 130-048-102) as
described45,46. Immunostaining for SftpC (rabbit, Chemicon AB3786; 1:100) was used to
determine purity, with 90% of cells positive for this AT2 cell type marker.
To determine if Shh+ embryonic progenitors were present in adult lung, we administered 4
mg tamoxifen to an adult (PN154) Shh-Cre-ER> mTmG mouse then collected and examined
the lungs six days later for cells expressing the lineage mark, which were not observed. We
also isolated distal epithelial cells from lungs of adult (PN70) B6 mice (n=3) as above,

AT2 cell culture

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Purified AT2 cells (described above) were seeded at a density of ~10,000 cells per well in
#1 8-well coverglass chambers (Labtek) containing DMEM/F12 media supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were cultured at 37°C for 16 days (with media replacement
every two days), during which they acquired an AT1-like cell phenotype47. Alternatively,
AT2 cells were cultured on a layer of Matrigel (BD) in serum-free media48 (DMEM/F12
supplemented with L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids, and penicillin-streptomycin) at
37°C for 72 hours, after which these conditions were either maintained or one of the EGF
ligands TGFα (4 uM, R&D Systems 239-A-100), HB-EGF (4 uM, R&D Systems 259HE-050), NRG1 (4 uM, R&D Systems 5898-NR-050) or a function blocking anti-EGFR
antibody (rat, Abcam AB231, clone ICR10; 2.5 ug/mL) was added and the cells cultured for
an additional 24 hours, then fixed (Cytofix/Cytoperm, BD) and immunostained for SftpC
(rabbit, Chemicon AB3786; 1:100) and Ki67 (rat, eBiosciences 41-5698-80, clone SolA15;
1:100) to identify proliferating AT2 cells. Stained samples were imaged using a Zeiss LSM
780 confocal microscope. Total and Ki67 positive nuclei were quantified (500 cells per
well) for each condition in a blinded manner.
Alveolar progenitor and AT2 cell gene expression profiling
RNA was extracted from E18 bipotent progenitors or adult AT2 cells (isolated as described
above, with yields of approximately 35,000 cells) using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen),
cDNA synthesized using a 2 cycle cDNA synthesis kit (Affymetrix) and analyzed on a
Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). RNA quality and quantity assessment, cDNA
synthesis, probe preparation, labeling, hybridization and image scan were performed by the
Protein and Nucleic Acid (PAN) facility at Stanford School of Medicine. Intensity values
acquired from the Expression Console (Affymetrix) were analyzed using Gene Expression
Commons49 (gexc.stanford.edu).

(a) Bipotent progenitors expressing some AT1 (green) and AT2 (red) markers differentiate into AT1 or AT2 cells. Mature AT2
cells function as stem cells intermittently activated for alveolar renewal and repair. Dying AT1 cells are proposed to produce a
signal (S1) transduced by EGFR-KRAS that activates division of nearby AT2 cell (self-renewal); another signal (S2)
reprograms a daughter into an AT1 cell. Activating mutations of Egfr or Kras in AT2 cell drives constitutive self-duplication,
forming tumor of AT2-like cells. (b) Rare AT2 cells function as stem cells, giving rise to clonal renewal foci (red, left) that
slowly enlarge, with persistence of founder AT2 cell (F1). With injury, additional AT2 cells (F2) are recruited to generate repair
foci (red, right). Activating Kras mutation in AT2 cell (F3) initiates tumor focus (red, top).
