Androgen Receptor

Abstract
During progression to an androgen-independent state following androgen ablation therapy, prostate cancer cells continue
to express the androgen receptor (AR) and androgenregulated genes, indicating that AR is critical for the
proliferation of hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells.
Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the development of AR-dependent hormone-refractory disease, including
changes in expression of AR coregulatory proteins, AR
mutation, growth factor–mediated activation of AR, and AR
protein up-regulation. The most prominent of these progressive changes is the up-regulation of AR that occurs in >90% of
prostate cancers. A common feature of the most aggressive
hormone-refractory prostate cancers is the accumulation of
cells with neuroendocrine characteristics that produce paracrine factors and may provide a novel mechanism for the
regulation of AR during advanced stages of the disease. In this
study, we show that neuroendocrine-derived parathyroid
hormone–related protein (PTHrP)–mediated signaling
through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
Src pathways contributes to the phenotype of advanced
prostate cancer by reducing AR protein turnover. PTHrPinduced accumulation of AR depended on the activity of Src
and EGFR and consequent phosphorylation of the AR on
Tyr534. PTHrP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of AR
resulted in reduced AR ubiquitination and interaction with
the ubiquitin ligase COOH terminus of Hsp70-interacting
protein. These events result in increased accumulation of AR
and thus enhanced growth of prostate cancer cells at low
levels of androgen. [Cancer Res 2009;69(18):7402–11]

Introduction
Expression of the androgen receptor (AR) plays an integral role
in the progression of prostatic adenocarcinoma to hormonerefractory disease (1, 2). Several mechanisms have been described
to account for the development of AR-dependent, androgenrefractory prostate cancer, including AR mutational activation,
coactivator overexpression, and activation via cross-talk with
growth factor signaling pathways. The most frequent mechanism,
however, involves increases in AR protein levels.
Increases in AR are both necessary and sufficient to convert
prostate cancer cells from a hormone-sensitive to a hormonerefractory state (3). This finding is consistent with reports showing

that high levels of AR are associated with aggressive clinicopathologic features and with decreased recurrence-free survival in
prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy (4). In
addition, immunohistochemical studies have shown that the AR is
expressed in essentially all human prostate cancers, including
those that have become hormone refractory following hormone
ablation therapy, and that the level of AR expression is often
increased relative to untreated tumors (5, 6).
One explanation for the elevated levels of AR is gene
amplification, reported to occur in f22% of advanced prostate
tumors (7). However, increased levels of AR observed in the
majority of prostate cancers may also result from increased AR
protein stability. As seen in recurrent CWR22 and LNCAP xenograft
tumors (8, 9), increases in AR are sufficient to allow continued
androgen signaling under conditions of low circulating ligand.
Chen and colleagues (3) have shown that increasing the
concentration of AR in prostate cancer cells using an ARexpressing lentivirus reduces the latency period for the development of LNCaP and LAPC4 xenograft tumors in castrate mice,
supporting the hypothesis that increased AR protein promotes
growth and survival of prostate tumors in low levels of androgen.
Another mechanism postulated to promote the progression of
androgen-refractory prostate cancer is the appearance of cells with
a neuroendocrine phenotype. Neuroendocrine-like cells are more
prevalent in androgen-refractory disease, occurring in 30% to 100%
of tumors studied (10, 11). The low proliferative capacity of
neuroendocrine cells allows them to resist treatment with most
chemotherapeutic agents as well as endocrine and radiation
treatments (12, 13). Neuroendocrine-like cells are thought to
provide growth and survival signals to surrounding tumor cells,
promoting the progression of hormone-refractory prostate cancer
(14, 15). This hypothesis is supported by work showing that
neuroendocrine-like cells enhance the growth of LNCaP xenografts,
with the greatest effects seen under conditions of androgen
deprivation (16, 17).
Parathyroid hormone–related protein (PTHrP) is one of the
secreted products of prostatic neuroendocrine cells, and its
expression in the human prostate is a manifestation of abnormal
growth regulation. In culture, PTHrP cooperates with low levels of
androgen to promote growth of androgen-dependent prostate
cancer cells, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for these
effects remain unclear (18). In particular, it is not known whether
the effects of PTHrP on growth are dependent on the AR.
In the present study, we describe a novel mechanism by which
neuroendocrine-derived factors, such as PTHrP, provide a proliferative advantage to prostate cancer cells. Our studies reveal that
LNCaP cells at low androgen concentration proliferated more
rapidly when stimulated with PTHrP. Under these conditions,
steady-state levels of AR protein were increased and this increase,
like PTHrP-induced proliferation, required the activation of

PTHrP Stabilizes AR and Enhances Prostate Cancer Growth

epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or Src and the
subsequent phosphorylation of the AR on Tyr534. We found that
targeting of AR for proteasomal-dependent degradation via the
chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligase COOH terminus of Hsp70interacting protein (CHIP) was decreased, resulting in the
accumulation of AR in response to PTHrP. The phosphorylation
of AR on Tyr534 reduced the interaction of AR with CHIP. Together,
these findings show that neuroendocrine-derived PTHrP stimulation of cancer cells results in the up-regulation of AR protein,
thereby promoting growth under low androgen conditions and
progression of hormone-refractory disease.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, transfections, and reagents. LNCaP cells were maintained in T-medium with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen) in a
humidified chamber at 37jC with 5% CO2. Transfections were performed
using TransIT-Prostate Transfection kit (Mirus) according to the manu-

facturer’s instructions. The plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged AR has been
previously described (19). The FLAG-AR-Y534F expression vector was constructed by subcloning AR-Y534F (gift of Dr. Young E. Whang, University of
North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) into pCDNA3.1-FLAG plasmid (20). For
experiments with cycloheximide (Calbiochem), cells were treated with cycloheximide (10 Ag/mL) throughout the period of R1881 and PTHrP stimulation.
Antibodies and reagents were obtained from the following sources: antiAR PG-21 (Upstate); anti-FLAG antibody, M2 (Sigma); anti–phospho-Src
(Tyr418), anti-Src, anti–phospho-EGFR (Tyr992), and anti-EGFR (Biosource);
anti-PTH/PTHrP receptor, anti-ubiquitin, and anti-CHIP (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); anti-tubulin (Calbiochem); anti-Hsp90 (StressGen); goat
anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse antibodies (GE Healthcare); Alamar Blue
(Biosource); PTHrP (1–34 amino acids), PP2, AG1478 (Calbiochem); and
PTHrP receptor antagonist (Nle8,18, Tyr34)-pTH(3-34)amide (Bachem).
The anti–phospho-Tyr534 antibody was raised against a peptide spanning
the Tyr534 phosphorylation site in human AR by standard methods. The
peptide (DSYSGPpYGDMRLETC) was synthesized with phosphotyrosine
and an NH2-terminal cysteine (Anaspec), coupled to keyhole limpet
hemocyanin, and used for antibody production in rabbits (Cocalico

Biologicals). Antibody titers were monitored by immunoblotting, and the
terminal bleeds were affinity purified using Sepharose-immobilized peptide.
The specificity of the antibody was verified by immunoblot analysis against
wild-type (wt) and Y543C mutant AR. The increase in immunoreactivity
observed with the phospho-Tyr534 antibody in response to EGF was similar
to that reported in published studies (21).
Cell proliferation assays. Growth of cells in a 96-well plate format
(2,500 per well), maintained for 2 d in various concentrations of R1881
and 1% charcoal-stripped serum (CSS) with or without PTHrP, was
monitored with the Alamar Blue assay according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cell numbers were determined by seeding 5  104 cells/mL in
triplicate onto six-well plates in RPMI 1640 without phenol red,
supplemented with 0.1 nmol/L R1881 and 1% CSS. The cells were treated
with PTHrP alone or together with PTHrP receptor antagonist (10 nmol/L),
PP2 (10 Amol/L), AG1478 (5 Amol/L), or DMSO control and counted using
a hemacytometer.
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. LNCaP cells were serum
starved overnight in RPMI 1640 and stimulated with R1881 (0.1 nmol/L) or
PTHrP (10 nmol/L) for the indicated times. The cells were lysed in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [137 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris
(pH 7.5), 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/s) deoxycholate, 0.1%
(w/s) SDS, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
1 mmol/L Na3VO4, protease inhibitors]. The lysate protein concentration
was determined using the bicinchoninic acid–containing assay (Pierce).
Endogenous AR was immunoprecipitated from LNCaP cells with 5 Ag of
anti-human AR per 100-mm dish, and immunoprecipitates were captured on
protein A–conjugated Sepharose beads (Roche). FLAG-AR was immunoprecipitated with M2 anti-FLAG antibody coupled to agarose (Sigma).
Precipitates were resuspended in sample buffer [10% (v/v) glycerol,
62.5 mmol/L Tris (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.01 mg/mL bromphenol blue],
resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting.
RNA interference. Silencing of Src was performed with Validated
Stealth RNAi DuoPak (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Transfection of Src small interfering RNA (siRNA) was done
in LNCaP cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM medium.
A nonspecific control duplex-XIII (Dharmacon Research) was used as a
siRNA silencing control. Maximal knockdown of Src was observed on day 3
after transfection.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Real-time reverse transcriptionPCR was performed as previously described (22). Briefly, total RNA was
isolated from LNCaP cells treated for 6 h with PTHrP, R1881, or both using
RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA quantity was determined with RiboGreen RNA
assay kit (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was produced following the iScript
cDNA synthesis protocol (Bio-Rad). cDNA amplification was conducted
on an iCycler optical system in the presence of iQ SYBR Green Mastermix
(Bio-Rad). The PCR primers used were the following: AR, 5¶CCTGGCTTCCGCAACTTACAC-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-GGACTTGTGCATGCGGTACTC-3¶ (reverse); prostate-specific antigen (PSA), 5¶T G G T G C A T TA C C G G A A A G T G G A T C A - 3 ¶ ( f o r w a r d ) a n d 5 ¶GCTTGAGTCTTGGCCTGGTCATTTC-3¶ (reverse); FKBP51, 5¶-AGGAGGGAAGAGTCCCAGTG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TGGGAAGCTACTGGTTTTGC-3¶

Results
PTHrP promotes growth of prostate cancer cells in low
androgen. The correlation of hormone-refractory prostate cancer
with increased neuroendocrine differentiation and up-regulation of
neuropeptide signaling, such as PTHrP (23, 24), prompted us to

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (18). September 15, 2009

investigate a potential involvement of PTHrP in androgendependent prostate cancer cell proliferation. We performed a
dose-response study of the effects of the synthetic androgen R1881
alone or R1881 together with recombinant PTHrP (10 nmol/L) on
LNCaP cells. After 48 hours, maximal proliferation induced by
R1881 alone occurred at 1 nmol/L. However, a significant growth
increase was seen when cells were maintained in medium
containing 1% CSS supplemented with as little as 0.01 nmol/L
R1881 and PTHrP (Fig. 1A), indicating that PTHrP reduces the
androgen requirement of LNCaP prostate cancer cells for growth.
As indicated in Fig. 1B, the proliferative advantage provided by
PTHrP occurs only in the presence of R1881.
It has previously been documented that EGFR and Src pathways
are induced on G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) activation (25–
28). To gain insight into the role of these pathways in PTHrPinduced proliferation, we evaluated effects of EGFR or Src
inhibitors on proliferation of the prostate cancer cells. PTHrPinduced proliferation of the cells was completely abolished by
treatment with AG1478 or PP2, the EGFR or Src inhibitors,
respectively. Similarly, PTHrP-induced LNCaP cell proliferation was
abrogated on treatment with PTHrP receptor antagonist (Fig. 1C).
These observations indicated that transactivation of both EGFR
and Src by the PTHrP receptor is necessary for the proliferation of
LNCaP cells in response to PTHrP.
Growth of castrate-resistant prostate cancer occurs in low levels
of circulating androgens but requires AR (2). Figure 1D shows that
growth of LNCaP cells in low-androgen and low-serum medium
was significantly increased by PTHrP, and this effect could be
blocked by AR siRNA. Together, these data suggest that PTHrP is
driving AR-dependent cell growth in this experimental model.
PTHrP stabilizes AR protein. We next analyzed effects of the
neuropeptide on AR protein levels. Serum-deprived LNCaP cells
were treated with R1881 (0.1 nmol/L), PTHrP (10 nmol/L), or both,
and AR expression was determined by immunoblotting. Androgen
was found to increase the steady-state expression of AR protein as
previously reported, but this effect was further enhanced in the
presence of PTHrP. Treatment of LNCaP cells with PTHrP alone
did not increase the AR protein level, indicating that the effect of
PTHrP signaling on AR is dependent on the presence of androgen
(Fig. 2A). A dose-response analysis of R1881 alone or together with
PTHrP showed that AR protein accumulates to a greater extent at
low androgen concentrations (0.01–0.1 nmol/L) when PTHrP is
present (Fig. 2B). Thus, PTHrP signaling leads to increased AR
protein under androgen-limiting conditions, suggesting that
PTHrP-induced LNCaP cell growth results from its modulation of
AR levels.
Significant accumulation of AR protein was observed following
treatment of LNCaP cells with PTHrP and R1881 for 6 hours. To
determine whether transcriptional up-regulation of the AR gene
occurs under these conditions, quantitative real-time PCR was used
to measure AR mRNA. Induction of AR gene expression was
observed on treatment of LNCaP cells with R1881 alone, but no
significant change was detected relative to treatment with R1881
and PTHrP (Fig. 2C). To ascertain whether PTHrP-induced
increases in AR are a result of changes in protein turnover, LNCaP
cells were treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 Ag/mL). As shown in Fig. 2D , treatment with
cycloheximide reduced the steady-state level of AR but did not
inhibit the stabilizing effect of PTHrP on AR protein, indicating
that PTHrP-mediated signaling influences AR levels posttranslationally. Together, these results suggest that the production of

PTHrP by neuroendocrine cells hypersensitizes prostate cancer
cells to androgen by decreasing AR turnover and thus increasing
the level of AR protein.
PTHrP-induced modulation of AR protein involves EGFR
and Src signaling. It is well documented that up-regulation of
growth factor signaling correlates with AR activation and
progression of prostate cancer (29–31). In addition, stimulation
of GPCRs has been shown to result in the transactivation of the
EGFR and Src pathways, prompting us to examine whether PTHrP
signaling stabilizes AR through the activation of these pathways. To
determine whether PTHrP stimulation is capable of activating
EGFR in LNCaP cells, phosphorylation of Tyr992 was measured by
immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies. Phosphorylation
of Tyr992 was increased after 1-hour stimulation with PTHrP in the
presence of androgen but was not induced by PTHrP or R1881
alone. Similarly, phosphorylation of the activating Tyr418 residue of
Src was shown to increase in response to PTHrP and R1881
treatment (Fig. 3A).
To determine if the PTHrP-induced activation of EGFR and Src
mediates the increase in AR protein, these pathways were blocked
pharmacologically. Treatment of LNCaP cells with either AG1478
or PP2 abrogated the AR-stabilizing effect of PTHrP (Fig. 3B).
Reduction of Src protein in cells transfected with specific siRNA
also resulted in a decrease in AR protein level relative to LNCaP
cells transfected with control siRNA even in the presence of PTHrP
(Fig. 3C), further implicating Src in mediating the PTHrP-induced
increase in AR protein. Together, these observations suggest that
both EGFR and Src signaling are critical to PTHrP-induced
regulation of AR.

PTHrP signaling decreases AR interaction with Hsp90 and
the E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. AR protein turnover is regulated in
part by association with chaperones, such as Hsp70 and Hsp90, and
occurs via ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (32, 33). To examine
whether the interaction of AR with chaperones is altered in the
presence of PTHrP, AR was immunoprecipitated from LNCaP cells
deprived of serum and treated with R1881 alone or in combination
with PTHrP. As shown in Fig. 4A, less Hsp90 was in complex with
AR when the cells were treated with R1881 and PTHrP. Analysis of
AR ubiquitination following immunoprecipitation also indicated
that PTHrP treatment reduced AR ubiquitinated species (Fig. 4B).
This observation indicated that AR is subject to proteasomedependent degradation under normal physiologic conditions and
that the presence of PTHrP can stabilize the AR protein by
interfering with its ubiquitination.
AR is a target of the ubiquitin ligases Mdm2 or CHIP, leading to
degradation by the 26S proteasome (34, 35). Based on the
observation that PTHrP reduces the interaction of AR with the
Hsp90 chaperone complex, we hypothesized that the reduction in
AR ubiquitination may be due to decreased interaction with the
CHIP E3 ligase. Analysis of the AR immunoprecipitate showed
reduced CHIP protein on treatment with PTHrP (Fig. 4B). These
data suggest that on PTHrP stimulation the interaction of AR with
chaperone-associated ubiquitin ligases and subsequent proteasomal-directed degradation is reduced.
AR tyrosine phosphorylation reduces CHIP interaction and
prevents PTHrP-induced accumulation of AR. In previous work,
we showed that EGF signaling results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of AR and modulates its interaction with Src (19). To

transfected with either nonspecific siRNA or siRNA targeting the Src gene as described in Materials and Methods. Two days after transfection, the cells were
serum starved and treated with R1881 (0.1 nmol/L) alone or together with PTHrP (10 nmol/L) for 12 h. Immunoblotting of cell extracts was performed using anti-AR,
anti-Src, or anti-tubulin antibodies.

determine whether PTHrP treatment influences the tyrosine
phosphorylation of AR, LNCaP cells were deprived of serum and
stimulated with R1881 or R1881 and PTHrP for 6 hours. Cell extracts
were subsequently prepared and immunoblotted with phosphospecific antibodies to Tyr 534, the primary site of AR tyrosine
phosphorylation (21). As shown in Fig. 5A, phosphorylation of AR
was increased on treatment with R1881 and PTHrP relative to R1881
treatment alone. Similar phosphorylation levels were observed
when AR was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies was performed (data not shown).
To assess whether the CHIP/AR interaction is modulated by AR
tyrosine phosphorylation, LNCaP cells were transiently transfected
with either FLAG-AR or FLAG-AR-Y534F. Immunoprecipitation of
exogenously expressed FLAG-AR complexes revealed that, similar
to endogenous AR, the CHIP interaction is reduced in the presence
of PTHrP. However, the phosphorylation-deficient AR-Y534F
mutant showed enhanced association with CHIP in response to
treatment with R1881 alone or in combination with PTHrP (Fig.
5B). This observation suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation of AR
is required for decreasing the interaction between CHIP and AR,
thus reducing its degradation.
To confirm that the phosphorylation of AR Tyr534 plays a role in
the PTHrP-induced accumulation of the protein, LNCaP cells

ectopically expressing FLAG-AR or FLAG-AR-Y534F were deprived
of serum and stimulated with R1881 alone or PTHrP and R1881.
Immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies revealed that FLAGAR, like endogenous AR, accumulated in the presence of PTHrP
(Fig. 5C). FLAG-AR-Y534F failed to accumulate in response to
PTHrP, indicating that the phosphorylation of this site is important
for PTHrP-induced stabilization of AR.
PTHrP modulates expression of androgen-regulated genes.
We examined AR transactivation in LNCaP cells stimulated with
PTHrP, R1881, or both. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of
androgen-regulated genes showed that PTHrP does not significantly modulate NKX3.1 expression in the presence of R1881 but
antagonizes R1881 induction of PSA transcription and enhances
mRNA levels of FKBP51. Down-regulation of DKK was observed in
the presence of R1881 or PTHrP (Fig. 5D).

Discussion
Increases in the neuroendocrine status of prostate tumors have

or long-term androgen ablation (36–38). Although neuroendocrinelike cells are nonmitotic, they produce neuropeptides, such as
PTHrP, neurotensin, and bombesin, which are thought to induce
proliferative or survival signals to adjacent cancer cells (16, 39). Our
data show that PTHrP-mediated signaling enhances the prolifer-

ation of prostate cancer cells by an alternative mechanism
involving the regulation of AR protein stability.
Androgen ablation therapy reduces the circulating testosterone
concentration from 4.5 ng/mL (21 nmol/L) to 0.28 to 1.3 ng/mL
(1.3–6 nmol/L), resulting in apoptosis of androgen-dependent

PTHrP Stabilizes AR and Enhances Prostate Cancer Growth

Figure 6. Model delineating the signaling
pathways mediating PTHrP-enhanced

to its cognate receptor results in the
transactivation of EGFR and Src. Tyrosine

tissues and regression of prostate cancer (40). In comparing the
growth properties of LNCaP cells, an androgen-dependent human
prostate cancer cell line, in the presence of PTHrP, a disparity was
observed in the levels of androgen required for cell proliferation.
LNCaP cells treated with PTHrP required androgen concentrations
2 orders of magnitude lower for growth stimulation (Fig. 1),
suggesting that in the setting of low levels of androgen following
pharmacologic or surgical castration PTHrP may enhance the
proliferation of prostate cancer cells. The proliferative advantage
provided by PTHrP seems to be associated with a complex pattern
of androgen-regulated genes, as indicated by the small sampling of
AR targets we examined. Further analysis will be required to
determine how the global pattern of gene expression contributes to
enhanced prostate cancer cell proliferation in the presence of
PTHrP and low androgen (Fig. 5D).
Under low androgen conditions, augmentation of LNCaP
proliferation or AR protein concentration in response to PTHrP
is mediated through EGFR and Src kinase activation (Figs. 1 and 3).
Transactivation of this pathway in response to neuropeptide
stimulation has been shown by Gschwind and colleagues (41) and
is consistent with our work in PC3 cells (25). In the current study,
phosphorylation of EGFR was detected after 1 hour of PTHrP
treatment corresponding with increased AR protein levels.
Activation of Src seems to be an important step in the regulation
of AR protein levels in the presence of PTHrP, as its inhibition
or siRNA knockdown abrogates PTHrP-induced AR accumulation
(Fig. 3). Src association with AR occurs either directly or in a
ternary complex with the scaffold protein RACK1 (19, 42), resulting
in AR phosphorylation, increased AR activity, and enhanced
LNCaP cell proliferation (21). Our data agree with these findings
showing that AR tyrosine phosphorylation is increased in response
to PTHrP (Fig. 4) and that PTHrP-mediated cell proliferation
requires AR as well as Src activation (Fig. 1). Src can also interact

directly with Hsp90 chaperone complexes, and its ability to
modulate client protein turnover further supports its involvement
in the modulation of AR protein levels (43). Chaperone proteins maintain AR in a partially unfolded ligand-free state to prevent aggregation of the protein but may also modulate AR protein
degradation, nuclear translocation, and transactivation (32).
It is possible that Src could modify or recruit various components of the complex to influence multiple aspects of AR
downstream signaling. Our work favors the hypothesis that
phosphorylation of AR modulates its ability to associate with the
chaperone complex. We observed that interaction of AR with
Hsp90 as well as Hsp70 is decreased in the presence of PTHrP
(Fig. 4; data not shown).
Molecular chaperones regulate the proteasome-dependent
degradation of several classes of proteins, including steroid
receptors, membrane proteins, and kinases. One link between
chaperones and the proteasome is CHIP. CHIP contains tetratricopeptide repeats for interaction with Hsp70 and Hsp90 and a
modified form of the Ring finger domain found in some ubiquitin
ligases (44). In conjunction with the UBCh5 group of E2 enzymes,
CHIP promotes ubiquitination of glucocorticoid receptor, CFTR,
and Raf kinase (45–47). Overexpression studies have revealed that
CHIP prevents the accumulation of AR and stimulates its
ubiquitination in LNCaP or HeLa cells (34, 48). Our observations
in LNCaP cells with endogenous CHIP levels are consistent with
these studies and show that AR polyubiquitination is reduced
in response to PTHrP stimulation and correlates with reduced
CHIP binding.
The interaction of CHIP with AR has been characterized in vitro
and was shown to depend on both unphosphorylated and serine/
threonine phosphorylated peptides of AR (49). In this study,
we find that the interaction of CHIP with the phosphorylationdeficient AR-Y534F is enhanced, suggesting that, unlike serine/

threonine phosphorylation, tyrosine phosphorylation may disrupt the AR/CHIP complex. Serine phosphorylation of AR has
also been described to enhance its proteasomal degradation. Serine
phosphorylation by Akt is postulated to increase AR ubiquitination by Mdm2 and lead to its degradation (49). Further analysis
will be required to elucidate the relationship between these
apparently antagonistic phosphorylation events in the regulation
of AR/CHIP interaction and their role in the regulation of AR protein turnover.
In summary, PTHrP enhances the proliferation of LNCaP cells at
low concentrations of R1881 by modulating androgen-induced
stabilization of AR. Under low androgen, PTHrP functions as a
compensatory signal to modulate the AR protein life cycle through
pathways that involve the activation of EGFR and Src. We show
that PTHrP-induced transactivation of EGFR, Src, and consequent
AR tyrosine phosphorylation sequesters a subpopulation of AR
protein from chaperone/CHIP complexes that normally regulate
the proteasomal-dependent degradation of the protein (Fig. 6). This
study provides one mechanistic explanation whereby increased
