Abstract
Tamoxifen is the most widely used adjuvant chemotherapeutic
for the treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)–positive breast cancer,
yet a large body of clinical and preclinical data indicates that
tamoxifen can modulate multiple cellular processes independently of ER status. Here, we describe the ER-independent effects of
tamoxifen on tumor metabolism. Using combined pharmacologic and genetic knockout approaches, we demonstrate that
tamoxifen inhibits oxygen consumption via inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, resulting in an increase in the AMP/ATP ratio
and activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo. AMPK in turn promotes

glycolysis and alters fatty acid metabolism. We also show that
tamoxifen-induced cytotoxicity is modulated by isoform-speciﬁc
effects of AMPK signaling, in which AMPKa1 promotes cell death
through inhibition of the mTOR pathway and translation. By
using agents that concurrently target distinct adaptive responses to
tamoxifen-mediated metabolic reprogramming, we demonstrate
increased cytotoxicity through synergistic therapeutic approaches.
Our results demonstrate novel metabolic perturbations by tamoxifen in tumor cells, which can be exploited to expand the therapeutic potential of tamoxifen treatment beyond ERþ breast
cancer. Cancer Res; 76(11); 3295–306. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

(ER) tumors to chemotherapeutic agents (4). Furthermore,
during the past two decades, more than 25 clinical trials have
been published reporting the effects of "high dose" tamoxifen
(i.e., doses above those needed to inhibit ER activity) ranging
from 80 to 720 mg/day (5) to treat non-breast cancers, including
glioma (6), melanoma (7), and others (8, 9), as a single agent or in
combination with chemotherapeutics. Although, of these, phase I
and II trials showed variable clinical beneﬁt, they clearly demonstrated the safety of high-dose tamoxifen in diverse patient populations. Pharmacodynamic analyses indicated that tamoxifen
could reach plasma concentrations as high as 8 mmol/L (8), and
additional preclinical studies indicated that tamoxifen accumulates in tumor tissue at 60 to 70 times the plasma concentration
(10). Therefore, further studies on "high-dose" tamoxifen are
clinically relevant and may result in expanded indications for
this affordable and well-tolerated chemotherapeutic.
The chemical properties of tamoxifen as a lipophilic weak
base contribute to its high partition into lipid bilayers, and tamoxifen has been previously described to have inhibitory effects
on mitochondrial respiratory rate (11) and membrane potential
(12). Cells in which oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
is inhibited by pharmacologically targeting members of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain, or due to lack of oxygen (hypoxia), exhibit a compensatory increase in glycolysis. For example,
metformin, a diabetes drug showing promise as a cancer therapeutic, was recently demonstrated to inhibit mitochondrial
complex I and to upregulate glycolysis (13). A deﬁning characteristic of many cancers is the Warburg effect, which denotes an
elevated aerobic glycolytic rate, irrespective of any hypoxic burden, as well as an increased dependence on ATP and macromolecule intermediates to support rapid cell growth and division

Tamoxifen is the most widely used nonsteroidal selective
estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for adjuvant therapy of
estrogen receptor–positive (ERþ) breast cancer. Patients on standard treatment receive tamoxifen at 20 mg/day for 5 years during,
or shortly after surgical removal of the primary tumor and
treatment with ionizing radiation or cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Tamoxifen therapy has reduced disease recurrence by half and
overall mortality by one third in ERþ breast cancer patients.
However, the development of tamoxifen resistance remains a
signiﬁcant clinical problem (1, 2).
The antitumor effects of tamoxifen are attributed primarily to
its antiproliferative activity via competitive inhibition of the ER in
breast tissue (2). Several studies have previously described nonER–dependent effects of tamoxifen, such as the inhibition of
protein kinase C (PKC; ref. 3) and the sensitization of ER-negative

(14). Tumor promotion by certain oncogenes can alter the metabolic characteristics of cells as a requirement for transformation
(15). As a result, strategies that target these vulnerable metabolic
pathways have shown signiﬁcant therapeutic promise. For example, both BRAF and KRAS mutations promote glycolysis (16, 17).
Resistance to targeted therapies limits the therapeutic options in
cancers such as melanoma and pancreatic cancer that are driven by
these pathways. The drug-resistant populations are thus dependent on elevated OXPHOS, and drugs that target mitochondrial
metabolism, including metformin, have potential utility in targeting such resistant populations (16, 18–20).
One of the consequences of OXPHOS inhibition, especially
in metabolically active cancer cells, is the activation of the AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK), the major regulator of cellular
energy homeostasis. AMPK is activated when the AMP:ATP
ratio increases, signaling a loss in cellular energy charge. AMP
binds to the g subunit of AMPK, inducing a conformational
change that prevents the dephosphorylation of the catalytic a
subunit of AMPK by phosphatases. This enhances phosphorylation of AMPK by upstream kinases, including LKB1 and
CaMKK2. Once activated, AMPK restores cellular energy levels
by promoting catabolic and inhibiting anabolic processes (21).
The role of AMPK in cancer is quite complex, as it has been
reported to function contextually as both a tumor suppressor
and promoter (22).
On the basis of these studies, we investigated whether
tamoxifen had an impact on cellular metabolism and metabolic signaling. Here, we report the ability of tamoxifen to
inhibit mitochondrial oxygen consumption, increase glycolysis, and alter fatty acid metabolism. We also observe rapid (<10
minutes) and acute activation of AMPK in vitro and in vivo in an
ER-independent manner. We demonstrate that activation of the
AMPK pathway by tamoxifen promotes cell death in triplenegative breast cancer cells in an AMPK isoform–speciﬁc manner. Moreover, we demonstrate that cells treated with low
micromolar doses of tamoxifen exhibit increased dependence
on glucose metabolism and that pharmacologic inhibition of
these processes is synergistically lethal with tamoxifen. Overall,
these data suggest that tamoxifen functions as a potent regulator of tumor metabolism and AMPK activity and that these
metabolic effects can be exploited with combination therapies
to increase tumor cytotoxicity.

cleaved caspase-3, and LC3B. ERa antibody was purchased from
GeneTex, AMPKa2 antibody was purchased from Millipore, and
siRNA against PRKAA2 was purchased from Dharmacon.
Cell culture
Cell lines were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,
penicillin/streptomycin, and HEPES at 37 C humidiﬁed 5% CO2
atmosphere. MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and 4175 cell lines were a gift
from Andy Minn (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA),
LCC1 cells were a gift from Robert Clarke (Georgetown University,

3296 Cancer Res; 76(11) June 1, 2016

Washington DC), and WM9 and 1205Lu cells were a gift from
Meenhard Herlyn (The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). Cell
lines were authenticated through genetic testing by ATCC.
Oxygen consumption measurements
Oxygen consumption was measured using a YSI 5300a Biological Oxygen Monitor. Electrodes were equilibrated in media
for 10 minutes. Cells were trypsinized and suspended at 2  107
cells/mL and injected into the chamber at a 1:10 dilution. After
the oxygen consumption rate was recorded, drug was injected
into the chambers at 10-mmol/L increments, allowing the consumption rate to be determined after each injection. Total protein
per chamber was quantiﬁed by Lowry assay.
Isolation of liver mitochondria
Liver was removed from a sacriﬁced mouse and homogenized
in 8 volumes of sucrose buffer [0.25 mol/L sucrose, 0.02 mol/L
KCl, 0.005 mol/L MgCl2, and 0.01 mol/L KH2PO4 (pH ¼ 7.4)].
Homogenate was spun at 600  g for 5 minutes at 4 C. The
supernatant was then transferred to a new tube and centrifugation
was repeated. Cleared supernatant was spun at 9,000  g for 10
minutes at 0 C, and the pellet was resuspended in sucrose buffer.
The following conditions were used for respiration measurements: complex 1 respiration: sucrose buffer þ 0.1 mmol/L ADP,
5 mmol/L glutamate, and 5 mmol/L malate; complex 2 respiration: sucrose buffer þ 0.1 mmol/L ADP and 5 mmol/L sodium
succinate.

Generation of CRISPR-Cas9 knockout cell lines
Knockout cell lines were generated using the CRISPR-Cas9
system as described previously (23). sgRNAs were designed to
target the ﬁrst exon of the genes of interest using the CRISPR
design tool at http://crispr.mit.edu/. Two sgRNA sequences were
chosen for each gene of interest (Supplementary Table S1). Brieﬂy,
sgRNAs were cloned into CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid. pSpCas9(BB)2A-Puro (PX459) was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid
# 48139). Cells were transfected using lipofectamine 2000 and
carrier DNA. Media were changed 24 hours after transfection,
and cells were selected with puromycin for 48 hours. Remaining
cells were grown up, and clones were selected. Clones were
screened for gene excision or mutation by DNA gel and expression
of the protein of interest by Western blot analysis. Knockout was
successful using both PRKAA1 sgRNAs 1 and 2. Knockout of ESR1
expression required combined transfection of sgRNA 1 and 2.
HPLC quantiﬁcation of AMP and ATP
AMP and ATP were quantiﬁed using a previously published
method (24). Brieﬂy, 2–4  106 cells were plated in 10-cm2 dishes
and treated with tamoxifen. Cells were then pelleted and nucleotides extracted with perchloric acid. Extracts were analyzed by ion
pair reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC). Analysis was carried out on Jasco HPLC. Separation was
performed on SUPELCOSIL C18 Column (15 cm  4.6 mm,
3-mm particle size) in combination with a Supelguard Ascentis
C18 guard column (2 cm  4.0 mm) from Sigma.

AMPK Activation and Metabolic Reprogramming by Tamoxifen

LC/MS-MS metabolite analysis
Liquid chromatography–selected reaction monitoring
(LC-SRM)/MS analysis of acyl-CoA thioesters was performed
as described previously (25). CoAs were separated using a
Reversed Phase HPLC Phenomenex Luna C18 Column
(2.0 mm  150 mm; particle size, 3.5 mm) with 5 mmol/L
ammonium acetate in water as solvent A, 5 mmol/L ammonium acetate in acetonitrile (ACN)/water (95:5; v/v) as solvent
B, and ACN/water/formic acid (80:20:0.1; v/v/v) as solvent C.
Samples were analyzed using an API 4000 triple-quadrupole
mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) in the positive electrospray mode. Samples (10 mL) were injected using a Leap
CTC Autosampler (CTC Analytics), where they were maintained at 4 C.
Short-chain and long-chain acyl-CoA extraction
Extractions were performed as described in detail previously
(25, 26). For more details, see Supplementary Methods.
Lactate extraction and analysis by LC/MS-MS
Media were aspirated and cells were quenched by the direct
addition of 1-mL 80 C 4:1 methanol:water (v/v) to the cell
culture dish. Plates were placed at 80 C for 20 minutes, scraped,
and transferred into Eppendorf tubes. Samples were pulse sonicated on ice for 30 seconds at a rate of 1 pulse/sec prior to
centrifugation at 16,000  g at 4 C for 10 minutes. The supernatants were then transferred to clean glass tubes and evaporated
to dryness under nitrogen. Dried residues were resuspended in
100 mL of mobile phase A for LC/MS analysis. For labeling studies,

assay preformed on cold samples and equal amounts of
[35S]-labeled protein were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Gel was
washed with ﬁxing solution (water with 20% methanol, 10%
acetic acid) for 30 minutes, washed with deionized water, and
then washed with enlightening solution (PerkinElmer) for 30
minutes. Gel was dried overnight using a Bio-Rad gel drying
apparatus. Gel was exposed to autoradiography ﬁlm at 80 C
and ﬁlm was developed.
Orthotopic xenograft tumors
Four-week-old female nu/nu mice were purchased from
Charles River Laboratories and housed in the University of Pennsylvania animal facility maintained on a 12-hour light/dark
cycle and given free access to water and food ad libitum. 4175
cells (2  106) suspended in 50 mL of a 50/50 mixture of PBS and
Matrigel Matrix Basement Membrane (Corning) were injected
into the mammary fat pad.
In vivo tamoxifen treatment
Tamoxifen (20 mg) was dissolved in 200-mL ethanol and
800-mL peanut oil. Ethanol was evaporated off overnight. Mice
were dosed via intraperitoneal injection once per day for 3 days
at 100 mg/kg.
Protein analysis from tumors
For more details, see Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed Student t test assuming homoscedasticity. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Tamoxifen inhibits OXPHOS and cellular oxygen consumption
independently of ER inhibition
Although tamoxifen has been reported to affect mitochondrial electron transport and membrane potential, its effects on
oxygen consumption have not been adequately described. A
Clark-type electrode was used to measure oxygen consumption
of cells. Tamoxifen, at low micromolar doses, inhibited oxygen
consumption in a dose-dependent manner in both ERþ MCF7
cells and triple-negative MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1A). Tamoxifen also inhibited oxygen consumption in a panel of 6 nonbreast cancer cell lines (Supplementary Table S2). The active
metabolite of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OH-Tam)
also inhibited oxygen consumption, whereas the ER antagonist
fulvestrant, which inhibits ER activity by blocking ER dimerization and promoting degradation of the ER (28), did not have
a signiﬁcant effect (Supplementary Fig. S1A). This suggests that
inhibition of ER signaling is not responsible for the rapid
inhibition of oxygen consumption in response to tamoxifen
treatment. To further rule out the involvement of ER signaling
in tamoxifen-mediated inhibition of oxygen consumption, we
used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to knock out ERa from LCC1
cells, a variant of the MCF7 line, which expresses functional ER
but is not dependent on its signaling for proliferation (29). The
ability of tamoxifen to inhibit oxygen consumption in the
LCC1-crspER cells was no different from the parental LCC1

AMPK Activation and Metabolic Reprogramming by Tamoxifen

Tamoxifen inhibits oxygen consumption by blocking complex I
of the mitochondrial respiratory chain
To determine whether the effect of tamoxifen on oxygen
consumption was due to a direct interaction with mitochondria,
we permeabilized MCF7 and MDA-231 cells using digitonin.
Tamoxifen inhibited oxygen consumption of mitochondria by
approximately 60% in both permeabilized cell lines. Respiration
could be rescued by supplementation with electron transport
chain complex II substrate succinate but not with complex I
substrates, glutamate and malate (Fig. 1D). These effects of
tamoxifen on mitochondria respiration are similar to what is
seen with rotenone, a known complex I inhibitor (Fig. 1D). In
mitochondria isolated from mouse liver, tamoxifen also inhibited
oxygen consumption in the presence of glutamate and malate but
not in the presence of succinate (Supplementary Fig. S1C). This
indicates that the tamoxifen-mediated inhibition of oxygen consumption occurs through a direct effect on mitochondria,
upstream of complex II. The addition of methyl succinate, a
cell-permeable analogue of succinate, to media, reduced the

Tamoxifen rapidly activates AMPK and AMPK-dependent
signaling
To determine whether inhibition of oxygen consumption by
tamoxifen alters cellular energy charge, we quantiﬁed intracellular
AMP and ATP pools following tamoxifen treatment. Tamoxifen
increased the AMP:ATP ratio in MDA-231 cells and MCF7 cells
(Fig. 2A), the major activating mechanism of AMPK, as soon as 5
minutes after tamoxifen treatment, and this ratio further increased
following one hour of treatment. This increase in the AMP:ATP
ratio correlated with concomitant increase in tamoxifen-induced
AMPK phosphorylation of the downstream signaling target ACC
and dephosphorylation of the mTOR targets P70S6K, S6, and

To investigate whether ER signaling is necessary for tamoxifen
activation of the AMPK pathway, we used pharmacologic and
genetic methods to block ER signaling. Pretreatment with fulvestrant did not inhibit tamoxifen activation of AMPK (Fig. 2D).
Furthermore, activation of AMPK in LCC1-crspER was comparable with that in LCC1 parental cells (Fig. 2E), indicating that the
effects of tamoxifen on AMPK signaling are also ER independent.
Tamoxifen treatment increases glycolysis
AMPK activation is known to increase glycolytic activity in
an attempt to restore cellular ATP pools (21). To investigate
whether this occurred after tamoxifen treatment, we measured
glucose uptake from the media in MDA-231 and MCF7 cells.
Glucose uptake increased in a dose-dependent manner with
tamoxifen treatment in both cell lines (Fig. 3A). To examine
whether glycolysis was also upregulated by tamoxifen, we
analyzed the incorporation of [13C] from [13C6]-glucose into
acetyl-CoA and lactate by LC/MS-MS. Following tamoxifen

3300 Cancer Res; 76(11) June 1, 2016

treatment, we observed an increase in [13C] labeling in these
products, indicating an increase in glycolytic activity (Fig. 3B
and C). The activation of AMPK (P-AMPK) was enhanced under
glucose deprivation conditions (Fig. 3D) and treatment with
the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2DG; Supplementary
Fig. S1E) in both MCF7 and MDA-231 cells, underscoring the
importance of the glycolytic switch for ATP generation during
tamoxifen treatment. Interestingly, under glucose deprivation
conditions, supplementation with methyl succinate rescues
MDA-231 cells from tamoxifen treatment, whereas it does not
signiﬁcantly improve MDA-231 survival in complete media
(Supplementary Fig. S1D). This effect further highlights the
importance of glycolysis during tamoxifen treatment.
Tamoxifen impacts fatty acid metabolism
Products of glucose metabolism are used for the synthesis
of fatty acids, which are of particular importance in cancer due to
the need to generate excess membranes for rapid proliferation.
Moreover, the oxidation of fatty acids in the mitochondria can

hagy, termed lipophagy, increases the supply of free fatty acids,
which are then transported into the mitochondria for oxidation
(30). We also observed a rapid activation of autophagy upon
tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 3E). BODIPY stain, which measures
total neutral lipid content in the cell, decreased modestly after 4
hours of tamoxifen treatment, by 14%, in cells treated with
tamoxifen (Supplementary Fig. S2B and S2C). These data suggest
that the accumulation of the long chain acyl-CoA species results

replenish cellular ATP levels during times of metabolic stress
(30). To examine whether tamoxifen also impacted fatty acid
metabolism, we preformed metabolite analysis of fatty acyl-CoA
species by LC/MS-MS. This analysis showed an accumulation of
acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA following tamoxifen treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). We also observed a reduction in
succinyl-CoA and other medium chain acyl-CoA species (C3:0,
C6:0), consistent with reports of the effects of other complex I
inhibitors (31) and an accumulation of longer chain (C16-C20)
acyl-CoA species (Supplementary Fig. S2A). The addition of
[13C]-glucose or [13C]-glutamine resulted in no labeling of the
long-chain CoA metabolites, indicating that these fatty acyl-CoAs
are not synthesized from glucose or glutamine de novo in response
to tamoxifen treatment. Activation of the AMPK pathway is also
known to promote b-oxidation of fatty acids as a strategy to
increase ATP pools. The degradation of lipid droplets by autop-

AMPK isoforms differentially regulate survival in response to

To further dissect the biologic role of AMPK in the cellular
response to tamoxifen, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to knock
out AMPKa1. We observed that loss of AMPKa1 resulted in a
compensatory increase in AMPKa2 expression (Fig. 4A) and

had increased survival in response to tamoxifen treatment
(Fig. 4C). This effect was recapitulated in MCF7 cells, where
AMPKa1 inhibition by shRNA resulted in reduced levels of
cleaved PARP and increased survival upon tamoxifen treatment compared with shNT-transfected cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3A and S3B). To evaluate the impact of complete
inhibition of AMPK catalytic activity on cellular response to
tamoxifen, we used siRNA to knock down AMPKa2 in both
wild-type MDA-231 cells and in crspAMPKa1 cells. Loss of
AMPKa2 in MDA-231 cells resulted in increased cell death
upon tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 4C), whereas knockdown of
AMPKa2 in the AMPKa1 CRISPR knockout cells resulted in
further increase in tamoxifen-induced cytotoxicity.
Interestingly, knockdown of either isoform of AMPKa
resulted in loss of phospho-ACC upon tamoxifen treatment,
whereas loss of AMPKa1 alone ameliorated the inhibition of
the mTOR pathway following tamoxifen treatment. Induction
of autophagy remained unchanged upon AMPKa1 inhibition;
however, knockdown of both isoforms substantially reduced
autophagy levels as seen by a reduction in LC3 processing (Fig.
4A). To further investigate the role of AMPK isoforms in the
autophagic response of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen treatment, we pretreated cells with E64d and pepstatin A to prevent
LC3-II recycling and monitored autophagic ﬂux by immunoblot. Although we saw reduced levels of LC3 in both siAMPKa2
and crspAMPKa1 conditions, MDA-231 cells require both
AMPKa1 and AMPKa2 to be knocked down to signiﬁcantly
reduce autophagy induction with tamoxifen treatment (Fig.
4B). These data suggest that AMPK activation promotes autophagy in response to tamoxifen treatment. To determine whether the AMPK isoform–speciﬁc effects on the mTOR pathway
impacted upon cellular translation, we pulse labeled MDA-231
cells and crspAMPKa1 cells with [35S]-cysteine and methionine. Translation was inhibited in both cell lines, albeit to a
substantially lesser extent in the crspAMPKa1 cells upon
tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S3E).

Notably, although the dual AMPKa1/2 knockdown showed
the highest levels of tamoxifen toxicity as determined by modiﬁed MTT assay, the levels of apoptosis markers cleaved PARP
and cleaved caspase-3 were quite low. This could be due to more
rapid processing of these markers under these conditions as
indicated by complete loss of total PARP in these cells. Caspase3/7 activity assay suggests a decrease in apoptosis upon AMPKa1
knockout, whereas Annexin V and propidium iodide staining
support an increase in apoptosis with AMPKa2 knockdown
(Supplementary Fig. S3C). However, the data from these apoptosis assays were not statistically signiﬁcant and showed only a
small trend toward different levels of apoptosis dependent on
AMPK status. Crystal violet staining of cells 7 days following
tamoxifen treatment also shows that AMPKa1 knockout rescues
cells from tamoxifen treatment, whereas AMPKa2 knockdown
promotes cell death (Supplementary Fig. S3D). Therefore,
although increased apoptosis may contribute to reduced viability of AMPKa2 knockout cells following tamoxifen treatment,
additional mechanisms leading to reduced overall survival are
likely involved.
Tamoxifen activates the AMPK pathway in an orthotropic
model of breast cancer
To determine whether tamoxifen activates the AMPK pathway in vivo, we injected 4175 cells, a variant of the MDA-MB231 triple-negative breast cancer cell line (32) into the mammary fat pad of athymic nude female mice. After 3 weeks of
tumor growth, 100 mg/kg tamoxifen was administered once
daily for 3 days. Mean tamoxifen and metabolite levels of
4OH-Tam and N-desmethyl-tamoxifen quantiﬁed by LC/MSMS in the tumor tissue were 19.07, 3.97, and 33.64 ng/mg
respectively (Fig. 5A). These data indicate that the concentrations of tamoxifen needed to activate the AMPK pathway in
vitro are achievable in vivo. Mice treated with tamoxifen also
had signiﬁcantly higher levels of phospho-AMPK and displayed downregulation of the mTOR target phospho-4-EBP1

(Fig. 5B and C). These results are in agreement with AMPK
pathway activation seen in vitro.
Synergistic combination of tamoxifen and inhibitors of
glycolysis increases cytotoxicity
Dual blockade of required metabolic pathways to target
tumor cells is gaining signiﬁcant traction in preclinical and
clinical settings. In terms of metabolic targeting, it has been
postulated that concurrently targeting adaptive responses to
metabolic reprogramming can lead to signiﬁcant enhancement of the therapeutic window for multiple chemotherapeutic modalities (33, 34). As we demonstrated that tamoxifen
blocks OXPHOS and concurrently increases glucose uptake
and utilization, it is likely that effective strategies for metabolic targeted therapies may require the inhibition of both
OXPHOS and glycolysis simultaneously. 2DG, a nonmetabolizable analogue of glucose and 3-bromopyruvate (3BP), an
alkylating agent and inhibitor of hexokinase-2 and GAPDH,
induced a dose-dependent decrease in glucose uptake, as
expected (Fig. 6A and C). More importantly, combined treatment with relatively nontoxic doses of each of these inhibitors
(Supplementary Fig. S1F) with tamoxifen signiﬁcantly
enhanced tamoxifen-induced cytotoxicity in MCF7 cells and
in MDA-231 cells (Fig. 6B and D). Notably, the sensitization
to tamoxifen was larger in the MDA-231 cells, which display a
higher basal rate of glucose uptake (Fig. 3A) and lower basal
OXPHOS level (Fig. 1B).

Discussion
We have demonstrated that beyond its antiestrogenic effects,
tamoxifen exerts a pronounced effect on tumor metabolism
via a non-ER, mitochondrial-speciﬁc pathway. Speciﬁcally,
through the inhibition of oxygen consumption upstream of
complex II, the increase in AMP/ATP ratio leads to the activation of AMPK, enhancement of glycolytic activity, and loss of
neutral lipid stores. We also discovered a previously unreported dichotomy in the role of AMPK isoforms in tumor survival following metabolic stress. Whereas AMPKa1 primarily
appears to promote cell death through inhibition of the mTOR
pathway and translation, AMPKa2 promotes survival by a yet
unidentiﬁed mechanism. We have also identiﬁed a strategy in
which these metabolic perturbations induced by tamoxifen
can be exploited for therapeutic beneﬁt through combination
therapy with glycolytic inhibitors
Although the clinical beneﬁt of tamoxifen in ERþ breast
cancer patients has been mainly attributed to the inhibition
of ER activity, tamoxifen has previously been shown to have
multiple effects independent of ER. We have further characterized the effects of tamoxifen on mitochondria by describing the
dose-dependent effects on oxygen consumption to occur independent of ER. We have also demonstrated that AMPK activation occurs in both ERþ and ER breast cancer cells and that it is
independent of ER signaling. In addition, tamoxifen activated
the AMPK pathway in an orthotopic model of triple-negative

breast cancer. Although we treated these animals for a short
time at a high dose, we would anticipate similar effects at a
lower dose over a longer period of time, as tamoxifen has been
shown to accumulate in tumor tissues to levels up to 60 to 70
times the plasma concentration (10).
The non-ER–dependent effects of tamoxifen described here
have the potential to expand the therapeutic window for tamoxifen into ER BC and non-breast cancers. Furthermore, most ERþ
BC related deaths have been attributed to metastatic disease,
which is often tamoxifen resistant (2). Although the mechanism
by which tamoxifen resistance occurs remains unclear, it is
thought to involve alterations in ER itself and alterations in the
levels of coregulators or downstream effectors in the signaling
pathway (2). Our results suggest that it would be valuable to
further explore whether combination therapies that take advantage of the metabolic effects of tamoxifen could restore tamoxifen
sensitivity or prevent resistance.
The precise target for tamoxifen in the mitochondrial respiration chain is not currently clear. The evidence presented in
this article supports the hypothesis that tamoxifen inhibits
complex I in the electron transport chain (see Fig. 7). The
ability of complex II substrate succinate to restore oxygen
consumption in tamoxifen-treated cells points to the inhibition
of mitochondrial respiration upstream of complex II. Moreover, the inability of complex I substrates glutamate and malate
to restore any oxygen consumption in permeabilized breast
cancer cells indicates that complex I may be the site of tamoxifen action (Fig. 7). However, we cannot completely rule out
possible effects of tamoxifen on upstream processes, such as the
TCA cycle, that contribute electron donors to the respiratory
chain. Another implication of our ﬁndings with translational
potential is the fact that inhibition of oxygen consumption is a
validated strategy to increase tumor pO2 and decrease hypoxia,
a major cause of cancer resistance to genotoxic therapy, including radiation (35). Therefore, tamoxifen has the potential to
function as a radiation and chemotherapeutic sensitizer. In fact,
other complex I inhibitors, such as metformin, have shown
anticancer effects through both their metabolic effects and
activation of AMPK. Although our results are reminiscent of
the metabolic effects of metformin treatment, both the inhibition of oxygen consumption and activation of AMPK occur at
a far more rapid rate (5–10 minutes) than that seen with
metformin (12–24 hours). Also important is the distinction
that although in vitro metformin exerts its OXPHOS-inhibitory
effects at doses ranging from 1 to 50 mmol/L, tamoxifen does
so at low micromolar concentrations.
We also show that like metformin, tamoxifen inhibited
OXPHOS and increased dependence on glycolysis (Fig. 7).
Intriguingly, soon after breast cancer patients begin treatment
with tamoxifen, a "metabolic ﬂare" is often seen in their FDG-PET
scans (36). Although the cause for this radiologic abnormality
has not been clearly delineated, it is reasonable to hypothesize
that this could be due to increased uptake of 2[18F]ﬂuoro-2deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in response to metabolic reprogramming
and AMPK activation, as GLUT 1 transporters, the major transporter system of glucose and FDG uptake, are AMPK targets (37).
Our results are also in agreement with other metabolic effects
of tamoxifen in patient populations. Women on tamoxifen
therapy have an increased risk for developing nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease (38). However, the effects of tamoxifen on
tumor fatty acid metabolism have not been investigated in

Figure 7.
Model of the effects of tamoxifen (Tamox) on cellular metabolism and
AMPK signaling. Tamoxifen directly inhibits the mitochondrial electron
transport chain at complex I. This results in a decrease in consumption of
O2 by complex IV and an increase in the AMP, ATP ratio, activating AMPK,
and promoting glycolysis and autophagy. AMPK signaling inhibits the
mTOR pathway and translation, resulting in cell death following tamoxifen
treatment. Modulation of fatty acid metabolism may involve direct
inhibitory action of tamoxifen on FASN activity.

detail. Accumulation of malonyl-CoA following tamoxifen
treatment has been reported previously (39), and we also
observed this in breast cancer cells. The synthesis of malonyl-CoA is the rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis; thus, its
accumulation leads us to suspect that there is a decrease in the
activity of FASN, which is consistent with AMPK activation. It is
also possible that increased upstream ﬂux through glycolysis
contributes to the accumulation of malonyl-CoA with tamoxifen treatment. It is worth noting that AMPK is also known to
inhibit fatty acid synthesis and promote b-oxidation, primarily
through inhibiting ACC (21).
The antitumorigenic effects of metformin in breast cancer
have been shown to be dependent on its activation of AMPK
(40). We asked whether AMPK had a similar role in beast cancer
survival of tamoxifen treatment. We used the CRISPR-Cas9
system to delete AMPKa1 from MDA-MB-231 cells and
observed a compensatory increase in AMPKa2 expression. This
would lead us to hypothesize that the isoforms have redundant
effects, yet we observed opposing effects on cell survival. Other
work examining the isoforms of AMPKa has identiﬁed some
differences, including the suppression of a2 expression in
primary breast cancer (41). Knockout of AMPKa1 alone rescued cells from tamoxifen treatment, whereas knockdown of

AMPKa2 increased cell death. Immunoblot analysis and [35S]
labeling of proteins indicated that the a1 subunit is responsible
for downregulation of the MTOR pathway and translation.
However, both isoforms are needed to inhibit ACC, and either
isoform can activate autophagy. We suspect that it is the loss of
robust autophagy induction in the dual AMPKa1a2 knockdown that results in increased tamoxifen cytotoxicity under
those conditions. The ability of tamoxifen to activate autophagy is well established. In fact, the autophagic response to
tamoxifen has been implicated in breast cancer resistance to
tamoxifen treatment (42, 43). In addition, the ability of AMPK
to activate autophagy via ULK1 is also well described (44). The
data reported in this manuscript are the ﬁrst to directly identify
AMPK activation as a mechanism of autophagy induction in
tamoxifen treatment. In summary, we have identiﬁed AMPK as
a mediator of tamoxifen toxicity through isoform-speciﬁc
effects.
We have also demonstrated the potential for increased therapeutic beneﬁt through drug combinations with tamoxifen that
have a synergistic effect via blockade of upregulated metabolic
pathways. Because of the fact that inhibition of oxygen consumption by tamoxifen results in upregulated glycolysis, effective strategies for metabolic interventions may require the
inhibition of both OXPHOS and glycolysis simultaneously.
Glycolytic inhibitors have long been attractive clinical agents
due to the Warburg effect, yet systemic toxicity has limited their
success in the clinic. 2DG has been tested in clinical trials, and
3BP has shown signiﬁcant preclinical potential (45). Our data
suggest that clinical use of these inhibitors in combination with
tamoxifen may result in increased efﬁcacy and use of reduced
doses that may limit toxicity.
In conclusion, we have characterized the ER-independent
effects of tamoxifen on cancer metabolism and described how

these effects can be exploited for therapeutic beneﬁt through
novel drug combinations with the potential to expand the clinical
use of tamoxifen.
