ABSTRACT
Auranofin (AF) is an anti-arthritic drug considered for combined chemotherapy
due to its ability to impair the redox homeostasis in tumor cells. In this study, we
asked whether AF may in addition radiosensitize tumor cells by targeting thioredoxin
reductase (TrxR), a critical enzyme in the antioxidant defense system operating through
the reductive protein thioredoxin. Our principal findings in murine 4T1 and EMT6 tumor
cells are that AF at 3–10 µM is a potent radiosensitizer in vitro, and that at least two
mechanisms are involved in TrxR-mediated radiosensitization. The first one is linked to
an oxidative stress, as scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by N-acetyl cysteine
counteracted radiosensitization. We also observed a decrease in mitochondrial oxygen
consumption with spared oxygen acting as a radiosensitizer under hypoxic conditions.
Overall, radiosensitization was accompanied by ROS overproduction, mitochondrial
dysfunction, DNA damage and apoptosis, a common mechanism underlying both
cytotoxic and antitumor effects of AF. In tumor-bearing mice, a simultaneous disruption
of the thioredoxin and glutathione systems by the combination of AF and buthionine
sulfoximine was shown to significantly improve tumor radioresponse. In conclusion,
our findings illuminate TrxR in cancer cells as an exploitable radiobiological target and
warrant further validation of AF in combination with radiotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

approach based on dedicated ROS scavengers, like
N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and mitoTEMPO, has so far not
found a place in clinical practice yet suggests interesting
possibilities to prevent tumor metastasis [4]. On the other
hand, the overproduction (rather than scavenging) of ROS
is known to kill tumor cells, a mechanism behind the
antitumor effect of mitomycin C, doxorubicin and ionizing
radiation [5, 6]. The latter pro-oxidant strategy is now under
intensive development with a focus on gamma-glutamyl
cysteine synthase (γ-GCS) and Trx reductase (TrxR), as
these enzymes are critical in the biosynthesis of GSH and
Trx and thus represent promising cancer targets [1].
GSH forms the main intracellular component
involved in a redox balance and is essential for cell

The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
tumor biology and therapy is currently evolving in two
directions. First, ROS clearly sustain tumor progression
and the acquisition of chemo- and radioresistance, which
are conferred by activation of the antioxidant defense
systems that allows tumor cells to proliferate under chronic
oxidative stress [1]. Indeed, the level of glutathione
(GSH) and the reductive protein thioredoxin (Trx), which
maintain the redox homeostasis by eliminating ROS, is
frequently increased in human malignancies and linked to
poor prognosis [2, 3]. Given an elevated intrinsic ability of
tumor cells to deal with oxidative damage, the antioxidant

proliferation and cell cycle progression [7]. In addition,
GSH determines the storage of intracellular cysteine
and eventually regulates the functional status of redox
sensitive and cysteine-dependent transcription factors,
such as NF-κB, relevant to both inflammation and
apoptosis. Therefore, major efforts in the past have been
already aimed at depleting GSH by buthionine sulfoximine
(BSO), a potent irreversible inhibitor of γ-GCS [1, 8]. This
approach appeared to be efficient in sensitizing tumor
cells to several chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation
[9, 10], and its combination with melphalan is now under
clinical investigation (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT00005835).
The history of TrxR is linked to the anti-arthritic
drug auranofin (AF), a gold complex with oxidative state
(I), which can elicit strong cytotoxicity against tumor cells
through the overproduction of ROS that in turn triggers the
apoptotic pathway [11–16]. The primary molecular targets
of AF are described to be mitochondrial and (to a lesser
extent) cytoplasmic TrxR [17], although other mechanisms
at the level of proteasome may also contribute to apoptosis
[18]. An intriguing finding is that AF may overcome
cisplatin resistance, since it impairs mitochondria rather
than DNA [19]. Overall, despite being an established antiinflammatory drug, AF seems to offer great promise in the
context of pro-oxidant cancer therapy, and is considered
for the combined modality treatment of leukemia (https://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01419691), lung cancer
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01737502) and
epithelial ovarian cancer (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/
show/NCT01747798).
Recently, the antitumor effects of AF have been
explored in more detail in preclinical models since this
drug is safe for cancer patients and fits the concept of
drug repurposing. AF induced strong cytotoxicity in
human chronic leukemia and gastric cancer cells due to
a lethal endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial
dysfunction accompanied by ROS overproduction [11, 12].
This effect could be potentiated by other ROS inducers
resulting in an increased apoptosis of tumor cells and
translated into a meaningful growth inhibition of tumor
xenografts [12]. Next to a direct antitumor effect, AF was
able to suppress the outgrowth of pulmonary metastases
in a model of human osteosarcoma in nude mice, and
the inhibition of metastatic phenotype was explained by
ROS-dependent apoptosis [13]. Finally, AF was confirmed
to be effective in drug-resistant multiple myeloma and
chronic leukemia cells, wherein triggering of apoptosis by
alternative ROS-dependent and independent mechanisms
have been elucidated in depth [14, 15]. To the best of our
knowledge, only one paper so far showed that AF can
enhance the radiation response in tumor cells even though
the disruption of antioxidant defense systems is a longstanding concept for radiosensitization [20].
In this study, we examined the radiosensitizing
potential of AF in vitro with regard to its plasma

concentrations and further validated radiotherapeutic
applications in tumor-bearing mice. We found that the
inhibition of TrxR and resulting ROS overproduction is
the principal mechanism of tumor cell radiosensitization,
which could be significantly enhanced by GSH depletion.
Therefore, our findings suggest the TrxR/Trx system as
a promising radiobiological target and prompt further
evaluation of AF for radiosensitizing purposes.

RESULTS
AF caused apoptosis and cytotoxicity in mouse
tumor cells
Our preclinical models are based mainly on EMT6
and 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cell lines and tumors,
which have been extensively studied in our lab for hypoxic
radiosensitization and immunological profiling [21, 22].
To investigate the cytotoxic properties of AF, EMT6 and
4T1 cell cultures were treated for 2 h and cell viability
was determined by MTT and colony formation assays
(Figure 1A and 1B). In a short-term (2 days) MTT assay,
AF decreased the cell viability in a dose-dependent manner
with the IC50 values of 19 and 11 µM for 4T1 and EMT6
cells respectively. In a long-term (8 days) clonogenic
assay, a survival fraction (SF) of 0.1 was detected at 15 and
17 µM respectively, indicating that concentrations below
10 µM produce less than 1 log cell kill and are suitable
for radiosensitization. To determine whether apoptosis was
involved in AF-induced cytotoxicity, the exposed tumor
cells were stained with Annexin-V/7-AAD followed by
flow cytometry analysis in 4T1 cells (Figure 1C–1D), and
in EMT6 cells (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure 2A).
At 10 µM, the apoptotic rates in 4T1 and EMT6 cells
were respectively 46% and 33%, which mainly reflected
late apoptosis in 7-AAD-positive tumor cells. Thus, other
than apoptotic death pathways contributed to AF-induced
cytotoxicity in EMT6 and 4T1 cells as well.

AF inhibited TrxR and triggered ROS
overproduction
It is well accepted that AF elicits cytotoxicity
mainly due to its inhibitory effect on TrxR resulting in an
overload ROS [23, 24]. Therefore, first, we assessed the
ability of AF to inhibit TrxR activity in 4T1 and EMT6
cells (Figure 2A). The inhibitory effects in both cell lines
were evident above 1 µM with a profound inactivation
of TrxR at 5–10 µM (Figure 2A). Next, the intracellular
redox status was evaluated through ROS generation
using the fluorescent probe CM-H2DCFDA. As shown
in Figure 2B–2D (and Supplementary Figure 2B), ROS
production was induced in a dose-dependent manner
and was significantly upregulated at 7.5 (*p < 0.05 and
***p < 0.001) and 10 µM (****p < 0.0001) in 4T1
and EMT6 cells respectively, according to the shift in

DCFDA signal. Apparently, the inhibition of TrxR by
AF occurs at relatively lower concentrations than those
causing a considerable increase in ROS, suggesting that
other antioxidative systems (such as GSH) may display
compensatory effects. Finally, the importance of ROS
production in observed effects was confirmed by using
NAC, a thiol-reducing antioxidant agent. Pretreatment
of 4T1 and EMT6 cells with NAC for 1 h at 10 mM
effectively attenuated the ROS overproduction caused
by AF, as shown in Figure 2B–2D further detailed in
Supplementary Figure 2B. In addition, NAC counteracted
AF-induced cytotoxicity (data not shown), indicating that
ROS production and cytotoxicity are linked.

The radiosensitizing potential of AF was examined
at concentrations below 10 µM, which are sub-cytotoxic
(< 1 log cell kill, Figure 1B) in 4T1 and EMT6 cells. Based
on this, tumor cells were treated with AF at 2.5, 5, 7.5, and
10 µM for 2 h and subsequently exposed to various radiation
doses under aerobic conditions (Figure 3A–3B). In line with
an increased ROS production shown in Figure 2C–2D,
we found a dose-dependent radiosensitization with an
enhancement ratio above 2 at 7.5–1 0 µM, which showed a
synergism of AF and radiation. To confirm the role of ROS
in AF-induced radiosensitization (at 6 Gy), we again applied

NAC pretreatment that fully reversed radiosensitization
in both 4T1 and EMT6 cells (Figure 3C–3D).
Since AF is known to induce ROS-mediated DNA damage,
a fundamental mechanism behind radiation-induced cell
death, we next examined double-strand DNA breaks by
quantifying the phosphorylation status of γH2AX. Radiation
(8 Gy) or AF (7.5 µM) alone increased the number of
γH2AX foci, which were suppressed by NAC in both cell
lines (Figure 3E–3F). Combined treatment displayed an
additive effect and increased DNA damage by more than
7-times compared with control (**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001
and ****p < 0.0001). Taken together, these data indicate a
mechanistic link between radiosensitization, DNA damage
and ROS overproduction induced by AF through TrxR
inactivation.

culture system (TMCS), a metabolic hypoxia model,
described in detail by our laboratory in previous studies
[22]. First, in murine 4T1 and EMT6 tumor cells, we
observed an impaired hypoxic radiosensitivity when
compared with aerobic survival curves. Indeed, a 1 log
cell kill (SF = 0.1) in hypoxia was achieved with 12.5
and 11 Gy in 4T1 and EMT6 cells (Figure 4A–4B), while
under aerobic conditions the same effect was observed at
7 and 6.6 Gy (Figure 3A–3B). Next, a clear AF-induced
radiosensitization was observed at 7.5–1 0 µM with an
enhancement ratio up to 2.5 and 1.8 for 4T1 and EMT6
cells respectively, pointing to a superior effect in more
radioresistant 4T1 cells (Figure 4A–4B). This effect
(at 10 µM) was reversed by the addition of NAC in both
cell lines (Figure 4C–4D). Afterwards, we validated
the radiosensitizing potential of AF in human HCT116
colorectal cancer cells. Under hypoxic conditions, AF
induced a dose-dependent radiosensitization with an up to
2.1-fold enhanced radioresponse after exposure to 10 µM
AF (Supplementary Figure 3A). Similar to aerobic tumor
cells, AF induced radiosensitization was counteracted by

NAC at 10 mM while NAC on its own did not modulate
radioresponse in hypoxia (Supplementary Figure 3B).
Overall, NAC pretreatment (without AF) did not exert
any impact on radioresponse in all tumor cell lines
including 4T1, EMT6 and HCT116, as further detailed in
Supplementary Figure 4. At this point, we compared the
radiosensitivity profiles of EMT6 versus 4T1 tumor cells
(Figures 3–4), and concluded that the latter model displays
a trend to decreased intrinsic radiosensitivity. Therefore,
the next steps in our study have been limited to 4T1 model

assuming that these tumor cells feature a more efficient
antioxidant system – an optimal target for AF and BSO.

AF induced mitochondrial dysfunction in 4T1
tumor cells
As ROS generation is a by-pass of mitochondrial
bioenergetics, the respiratory status of tumor cells has
been further dissected in a Seahorse analyzer using a
sequence of specific inhibitors. AF significantly decreased

the basal oxygen consumption rate, and in addition the
maximal respiratory capacity and ATP output in 4T1 tumor
cells (**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001), as
illustrated in Figure 5A and further summarized in Figure
5B. Overall, the inhibition of oxygen consumption and the
resulting sparing of oxygen, a potent radiosensitizer, seem
to offer an additional radiosensitizing effect specifically
in hypoxia next to the basic mechanism through ROS
overproduction. To get more insight into mitochondrial
dysfunction induced by AF, we measured the mitochondrial
membrane potential ΔΨm, an important parameter of
membrane integrity. We anticipated that membrane
depolarization would explain an uncoupled oxidative
phosphorylation (ATP decline) and resulting apoptosis
induced by AF in 4T1 tumor cells (Figures 5A–5B
and 1C–1D). As demonstrated in Figure 5C–5D (and
Supplementary Figure 2C), exposed tumor cells showed
a decreased signal of TMRE, a cell permeable fluorescent
dye, which is effectively retained in intact but not
damaged mitochondria. We observed a dose-dependent
decrease of ΔΨm induced by AF with 50% inhibition at
10 µM (*p < 0.05).

Given that GSH may back-up the deficit of
reduced Trx, we asked whether a dual targeting of those
systems by AF and BSO may be beneficial in terms of
cytotoxicity and radiosensitization. First, we assessed
GSH biosynthesis in 4T1 cells, and found a progressive
depletion of total GSH caused by BSO at 0.25–3 µM
(**p < 0.01 and ****p < 0.0001) with a half-decline at
0.5 µM (Figure 6A). Next, we examined the effect of
combined AF and BSO at non-cytotoxic concentrations of
2.5 and 3 µM respectively. Strikingly, this combination
displayed significant synergism with a resulting SF of 0.3
(***p < 0.001), which was abolished by NAC (Figure 6B).
Based on these data, similar combinations were applied for
radiosensitizing purposes under both aerobic and hypoxic
conditions. BSO (1 µM) and AF (2.5 µM) alone did not
alter radiosensitivity, while their combination enhanced
aerobic and hypoxic radioresponse by 1.5 and 1.9 times
respectively (Figure 6C–6D). Thus, this combination
showed a preferential radiosensitizing effect in hypoxic

(10 mM) was added 1 h prior and during treatment. To assess hypoxic radiosensitivity, subconfluent cultures were irradiated in a metabolic

4T1 cells, which displayed a clear radioprotection in the
TMCS, our model of metabolic hypoxia. As expected,
those synergistic effects were counteracted by NAC
(Figure 6E–6F). The observed synergism between AF
and BSO was of particular interest for in vivo applications
since the plasma-achievable levels of AF are known
to be around 3 µM, which is on a low side of effective
radiosensitizing concentrations according to our data
(Figures 3–4).

systems in tumor cells that overweigh the scavenging
potential of NAC under basal levels of ROS in the absence
of AF. Under tumor-modeling hypoxic conditions, we also
observed the arrest of oxygen consumption in mitochondria
suggesting an alternative effect of AF through spared
oxygen, a potent radiosensitizer. The latter mechanism can
be detected only in metabolically induced hypoxia, which
recently attracted more attention given that the inhibition of
mitochondrial respiration rather than an increase in oxygen
supply may offer an efficient way to overcome hypoxic
radioresistance [22, 26]. Tumor hypoxia is a recognized
negative factor for therapy outcomes, and the ability of AF
to reverse metabolic radioresistance suggests the promising
possibility to preferentially target poorly oxygenated
tumor cells.
It is worthy to stress that the nature of effects so far
ascribed to AF, and more generally to gold formulations,
is multifaceted and continues to expand. The metallic gold
in a form of nanoparticles is non-toxic up to 1000 µM and
displays radiosensitizing properties due to the secondary
low-energy beams (Auger electrons) that amplify
radiation-induced DNA damage [27]. Both low toxicity
and direct radiosensitization are lost once the gold atom
is oxidized to a complex (I), with AF as an example, and
further to a more stable complex (III), both of which were
broadly screened for cytotoxicity and antitumor effects
[28]. AF was reported to inactivate TrxR above 3 µM that
in part explains strong cytotoxicity against tumor cells, as
lack of this redox-critical enzyme results in mitochondrial
dysfunction caused by ROS [17].
In line, we found (i) dose-dependent TrxR
inhibition, (ii) followed by ROS overproduction and
(iii) accompanied by mitochondrial and further DNA
damage. This sequence of events caused by AF has
been described in many types of tumor cells undergoing
apoptosis [11, 12, 16], which was detected in our model
as well yet leaving a space for other (unidentified) death
pathways. In our settings, apoptosis was detected above
5 µM AF in a threshold-like manner, a phenomenon that
seems to be triggered once the level of ROS becomes
incompatible with the mitochondrial membrane integrity
[29]. Interestingly, AF-induced radiosensitization through
TrxR occurs at 1–2 log lower concentrations when
compared with that of bio-inert metallic gold operating
through photoelectrons [30]. More importantly, our data
indicate that AF at plasma relevant levels is exploitable
for radiosensitization, a novel mechanism that points to an
appealing opportunity of rescaling current clinical trials so
far limited to chemotherapeutic goals (https://clinicaltrials.
gov/ct2/show/NCT01747798, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/
show/NCT01737502). Supporting this conclusion, two
other gold (I) complexes, namely Au(SCN)(PEt(3)) and
an Au(I)-indole, were reported to possess radiosensitizing
properties as well [31, 32].
It is essential to acknowledge that ROS-mediated
effects are complex and interplay with the multiple

AF combined with BSO enhanced radioresponse
of 4T1 tumor
To validate the in vitro findings, the radiosensitizing
effect of AF combined with BSO was evaluated in both
4T1 and EMT6 tumor-bearing mice. The experimental
scheme is depicted in Figure 7A. In 4T1 tumor model,
radiation alone at 15 Gy delayed tumor growth by 6 days
measured at a tumor volume of 1000 mm3 (Figure 7B).
AF combined with BSO enhanced tumor radioresponse
resulting in a tumor growth delay of 13 days and
thereby significantly increased the medium survival rate
(Figure 7B and 7C), while neither of these pharmaceuticals
were effective when administered on their own (Figure 7D
and 7E). Importantly, BSO (25 mg/kg) and/or AF (3 mg/kg)
applied for 10 days were safe and represented the
maximal tolerated doses with no significant body weight
loss (Figure 7F). In EMT6 tumor model, which is more
radiosensitive than 4T1, radiation alone at 12 Gy delayed
tumor growth by 20 days measured at a tumor volume of
500 mm3 (Figure 8A). AF plus BSO further delayed the
tumor growth by 9 days compared with radiation alone
(Figure 8A), and this combination once again increased
the survival rate of tumor-bearing mice (Figure 8B). Of
note, similar to 4T1 tumor model, BSO plus AF treatment
did not show notable toxicity in mice, as measured by the
body weight loss (Figure 8C). Altogether, our data point
to the necessity of dual targeting of the TrxR/GSH systems
by the combination of AF and BSO.

DISCUSSION
In this study we examined the hypothesis that
the anti-arthritic drug AF may be repurposed for
radiotherapeutic applications and undertook the first step
to evaluate its radiosensitizing potential in mouse 4T1 and
EMT6 tumor cells. Our fundamental findings are that AF
at 3–10 µM increases tumor cell radiosensitivity in vitro
over 2-fold, and two mechanisms appear to be engaged.
The first one is tightly related to an oxidative stress, as the
classic scavenger NAC abolished both ROS overproduction
and radiosensitization yet by itself did not modulate
radioresponse. These divergent properties may be explained
by its ability to mitigate radiation-induced DNA damage
but not affect the cell kill [25]. The latter result is further
corroborated by the very efficient TrxR/GSH anti-oxidant

inflammatory pathways associated with tumor progression,
as schematically summarized in Supplementary Figure 1.
Briefly, ROS may display both pro- and anti-tumor
properties, and on the top we could expect both proand anti-inflammatory effects from AF, considering
the history of its use as an anti-arthritic drug [33]. The
latter medication was linked to the inhibition of proinflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα, NF-κB etc.)
and oxidative burst in monocytes and granulocytes
respectively [34, 35]. This picture is opposed to a more
recent pro-oxidant approach, where drug-induced ROS
cause apoptosis/cytotoxicity in tumor cells [1]. It remains
to be clarified whether an oxidative stress signature is of
prognostic value, while the inflammatory desmoplastic
reaction in tumor-associated fibroblasts is known to
promote tumorigenesis [36]. In this context, our findings
are obviously valid for tumor cells only and should
not be projected to the host stromal and immune cells
involved in cancer-related inflammation. However, we
previously showed that myeloid cells can undergo protumor polarization [37], accompanied by an increased

neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and arginase activation
[21], in line with the recent literature [38, 39] and the
extensive background on the immune landscape in cancer
[40, 41]. Hence, AF might target the myeloid lineage
differently from tumor cells and thereby offer still another
way to restore tumor radioresponse through immune cells,
as we previously proposed for rectal cancer [42].
While this speculative mechanism remains to be
explored, our preliminary data suggest that the in vitro
radiosensitizing effect of AF, evident in aerobic and
hypoxic 4T1 and EMT6 tumor cells, is a probable cause
of an improved tumor radioresponse in vivo. This setting
was designed with regard to a current consensus on
the coordinated role of the γ-GCS/GSH and TrxR/Trx
antioxidant systems in clinical chemo- and radioresistance,
as overviewed in detail elsewhere [9, 19, 43]. The
γ-GCS inhibitor BSO is a well-documented chemo- and
radiosensitizer in experimental models [10], and in our
hands it potentiated the cytotoxic and radiosensitizing
effect of AF in vitro. The combination AF plus BSO
showed a preferential radiosensitizing effect in hypoxic

tumor cells, which featured an impaired radioresponse in
the TMCS, our model of metabolic hypoxia. In mice, their
simultaneous administration enhanced radioresponse in
EMT6 and 4T1 mammary carcinomas, in line with a very
recent report in a MDA-MB-231 breast cancer model [20].
We concluded that the combination of AF and BSO could
be a promising radiosensitizing strategy justified in view
of them being ready-to-use pharmaceuticals for clinical
evaluation.

In contrast to some other reports, we were not able to
detect the antitumor effect induced by AF and BSO alone
but confirmed low toxicity associated with their chronic
use. A plausible explanation is that radiosensitization may
occur at lower sub-cytotoxic drug levels (< 1 log cell kill)
than those required for the direct inhibition of fast growing
tumors, therefore pointing to a synergistic interaction with
irradiation. Clearly, a plasma achievable level of 3 µM,
known for AF [44], is a limiting factor of cytotoxicity and

radiosensitization in vivo, which are below the observed
effects in cell cultures rescaled to 5–10 µM. Our preclinical
settings also suffer from some limitations due to the
intramuscular tumor site, therefore lacking the physiological
microenvironment in the mammary gland. However,
radiotherapeutic applications in mice require a practical
way to immobilize the bulky tumors precisely within the
irradiation field, and are generally based on non-orthotopic
implantations [20]. On the other hand, our pharmacological
treatments do reflect clinical trials, where AF is administered
chronically at safe maximal tolerated doses.
Likewise, recent preclinical studies highlighted
the chemotherapeutic importance of knocking down the
antioxidant cellular defense by AF, and described an
impressive list of divergent ROS-mediated mechanisms,
which suppressed the growth of local tumors [11, 12]
and metastasis [13] or reversed chemoresistance [19].
Along with improved radiation responses, AF sensitized
breast cancer stem cells, and in combination with BSO
decreased cell migration and invasion [20]. Of note,
inhibition of TrxR by curcumin and 1, 2, 5-selenadiazole
showed a comparable array of antitumor effects including
radiosensitization [32, 45–47], while the disruption
of GSH pathways by genistein and gadolinium (III)
texaphyrin resulted in ROS-mediated radiosensitization
[48, 49]. Compelling evidence also suggests that the
abundant GSH pool is an important backup to keep Trx
reduced, and therefore a dual targeting of the GSH/Trx
antioxidant systems is required [43, 50].
The next logical development is to apply a triple
inhibition of GSH/Trx/Nrf2, where the latter mediator is
responsible for maintaining the anti-oxidant system in a
reduced state [51]. Blocking the glycolysis and pentose

cycle pathways may also interrupt GSH/Trx-dependent
cellular defense, while NAC reverses an amplified
clonogenic cell death triggered by ROS [52]. Both Trx and
GSH are currently recognized as key targets in chemo/
radiosensitizing strategies in line with our data, while a
single TrxR inactivation may not be always enough to
achieve meaningful effects. Indeed, genetic knockingdown of TrxR by siRNA appears to be short of efficiency
to inhibit its enzymatic activity or to provoke ROS
overproduction, likely due to high TrxR abundance at
translational and transcriptional levels fostered by GSH
[51, 52]. Overall, the multi-layered anti-oxidant system in
tumor cells prompts a multi-targeted approach to deal with
clinical chemo/radioresistance.
The recent progress in cancer radiotherapy is based
on the stepwise implementation of image-guided and
intensity-modulated radiation beams that deliver a shaped
dose distribution tailored to tumor anatomy [53]. However,
up to 30% of locally advanced cancers show unsatisfactory
down-staging even after applying a simultaneous
integrated boost that nowadays represents the most
intensified radiation approach to improve local control
[54]. Further dose escalation would compromise clinical
safety, and thus overcoming radioresistance by available
pharmaceuticals is an urgent need and necessity in order to
address poor outcome in high-risk patients. Our preclinical
4T1 and EMT6 tumor models suggest that an increased
local radioresponse is feasible, once the antioxidant
defense systems are targeted by specific inhibitors at
the cost of marginal if any adverse effects. As outlined
above (Supplementary Figure 1), our understanding of
inflammatory and ROS-mediated pathways in cancer
is evolving, and opens novel possibilities to revisit

established drugs with yet uncovered radiosensitizing
properties. With this concept in mind, our research program
at Radiotherapy Department (UZ Brussels) is making
major efforts to re-examine metformin (manuscript in
preparation) and AF for radiotherapeutic applications, and
the present set of data emphasizes a novel way to exploit
the known molecular target TrxR for radiosensitizing
purposes. The next pre-clinical steps could be validation of
AF-induced radiosensitization in other tumor models and
for fractionated radiation.
In conclusion, the anti-arthritic drug AF reveals
radiosensitizing properties through targeting TrxR and
resulting ROS overproduction, a common mechanism
conferring its cytotoxic, antitumor and chemosensitizing
effects. Our findings illuminate the redox TrxR/Trx system
in cancer cells as an exploitable radiobiological target, and
warrant further experimental and clinical approval for AF
in combination with radiotherapy.

respectively. All experiments were performed in RPMI
1640 medium (Thermo Fisher, Belgium) supplemented
with 10% bovine calf serum (Greiner Bio-one, Belgium).
Chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Antwerp,
Belgium) unless otherwise stated.

Treatments
EMT-6 and 4T1 cultures were grown to confluence
and treated with AF (2 h) and/or BSO (16 h) at indicated
concentrations. The ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine
(NAC) was added at 10 mM to cultures both 1 h prior and
during treatment with AF. Afterwards, cultures were used
for further analysis as described below.

Cytotoxicity and MTT assay
A total of 5000 cells were plated in 100 μl medium
in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere for 24 h. AF was
added at indicated concentrations for 2 h, and cultures
were rinsed with fresh medium and re-incubated for
additional 24 h. Next, 10 μl of the MTT reagent (5 mg/ml)
was added for 3 h, and 150 μl of DMSO was admixed to
dissolve the formazan crystals. Absorbance was measured
at a wavelength of 540 nm by using a spectrophotometer

was determined by dividing the absorbance values of
treated cells to that of untreated (control) cells.

CM-H2DCFDA at 37°C for 30 min and analyzed by
flow cytometry.

TrxR activity

Radiation and clonogenic assay

TrxR activity was measured by using a commercial
kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Antwerp, Belgium) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. In this assay, TrxR
catalyzes the reduction of 5, 5-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic)
acid (DTNB) to 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid, which
generates a strong yellow color. Briefly, cells were
treated with AF, lysed with CelLytic Buffer (SigmaAldrich, Antwerp, Belgium) and disrupted by sonication
for 1min. Afterwards, 180 μl of TE buffer containing
DTNB and NADPH was added. The linear increase in
absorbance at 412 nm was measured during 30 min using
a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA). TrxR activity was calculated as a percentage of
enzyme activity to that of DMSO-treated samples.

Clonogenic assay was performed as reported in
detail elsewhere [22]. Briefly, confluent cultures in 6-well
plates were treated with AF and/or BSO and irradiated at a
dose rate of 2 Gy/min on a 6 MV Linac (Elekta, Crowley,
UK). To induce hypoxia, treated cultures were placed
in a tissue-mimetic culture system (TMCS) for 45 min
at 37°C in order to metabolically consume oxygen [22].
Cells were then irradiated at indicated doses, trypsinized
and reseeded for colony formation. After 8 days, cultures
were fixed with crystal violet and colonies (> 50 cells)
were counted. Survival fractions (SF) were fitted to the
linear quadratic model using GraphPad Prism 5 software
(GraphPad Prism Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
Radiosensitization was expressed as an enhancement ratio
determined at a SF of 0.1.

GSH assay

Apoptotic assay

GSH levels were measured with a commercial GSH
assay kit (Sanbio, Belgium). Briefly, cells were treated
with BSO, washed twice with PBS and resuspended in
cold MES buffer. Next, cells were lysed by sonication
for 1 min, centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C
and finally deproteinized by phosphoric acid. Afterwards,
50 μl of the collected supernatant was added to 150 μl
assay cocktail, and absorbance was measured at 405 nm
using a spectrophotometer during 30 minutes with fiveminute intervals.

Apoptosis was analyzed by using the double
staining with the lipophilic dye Annexin V and 7-amino
actinomycin D (7-AAD) (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Briefly,
0.5 × 106 cells were treated with AF for 2 h, harvested by
trypsin, washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 100 μl.
Thereafter, 2.5 μl Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl 7-AAD were
added to the cell suspensions and incubated for 20 min
at room temperature in the dark. Early apoptotic cells
(Annexin V-positive, 7-AAD-negative), necrotic/late
apoptotic cells (double-positive), and living cells (doublenegative) were determined by flow cytometry (BD LSR
Fortsessa, BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes, USA).

Oxygen consumption rates
Oxygen consumption rates were determined using
a Seahorse XF96 analyzer (Seahorse Biosciences, North
Billerica, MA, USA) as previously reported [55]. Briefly,
1.5 × 105 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and 24 h
later were treated with AF for 2 h. Afterwards, cultures
were equilibrated in unbuffered DMEM with glutamine
and glucose at 37°C in a CO2-free incubator and processed
for measurements. To extract detailed information on the
electron transport chain in mitochondria, the standard
sequence of specific inhibitors consisting of oligomycin,
FCCP, rotenone and antimycin A was used.

Double-strand DNA breaks
DNA damage following irradiation at 8 Gy was
determined by the extent of phosphorylation of the
histone protein γH2AX. Cells were treated with AF
(7.5  μM) for 2  h, fixed in a buffer (Miltenyi biotec,
Leiden, Netherlands) for 15 min at room temperature
and permeabilized for 20 min in 90% methanol at –20°C.
Next, cells were incubated with 0.1 μg γH2AX antibody
(Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 40 min at 4°C and analyzed
by flow cytometry.

Mitochondrial membrane potential
Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured
using a potential-dependent positively-charged red-orange
dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (Abcam, Cambridge,
UK), which accumulates in active mitochondria due to
their relative negative charge. Briefly, after treatment with
AF for 2 h, cells were stained with 400 nM dye at 37°C for
30 min and analyzed by flow cytometry.

ROS production
The intracellular level of ROS was detected using
5-(6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein
diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA), an oxidation-sensitive
fluorescent probe (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Briefly, cells
were treated with AF for 2 h, stained with 5 μM
