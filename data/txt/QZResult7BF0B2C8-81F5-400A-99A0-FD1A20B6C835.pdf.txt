Abstract
The PI3K/Akt pathway plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM) in the bone marrow
(BM) milieu. However, efﬁcacy of selective and potent Akt inhibition has not yet been fully elucidated. In this
study, we, therefore, examined the biologic impact of selective and potent Akt inhibition by a novel allosteric
inhibitor TAS-117. TAS-117 induced signiﬁcant growth inhibition, associated with downregulation of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), selectively in MM cell lines with high baseline p-Akt. Cytotoxicity of TAS-117 was also observed
in patient MM cells, but not in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Importantly, TAS-117 induced
signiﬁcant cytotoxicity in MM cells even in the presence of BM stromal cells, associated with inhibition of IL6
secretion. Oral administration of TAS-117 signiﬁcantly inhibited human MM cell growth in murine xenograft
models. TAS-117 triggered apoptosis and autophagy, as well as induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
response with minimal expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a fatal ER stress marker. Importantly,
TAS-117 enhanced bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity, associated with increased CHOP and PARP cleavage and
blockade of bortezomib-induced p-Akt, suggesting that TAS-117 augments bortezomib-induced ER stress and
apoptotic signaling. Carﬁlzomib-induced cytotoxicity was similarly enhanced by TAS-117. Importantly, TAS-117
enhanced bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity in vivo, associated with prolonged host survival. Our results show that
selective and potent Akt inhibition by TAS-117 triggers anti-MM activities in vitro and in vivo, as well as enhances
cytotoxicity of proteasome inhibition, providing the preclinical framework for clinical evaluation of selective Akt
inhibitors, alone and in combination with proteasome inhibitors in MM. Cancer Res; 74(16); 4458–69. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by excess plasma
cells in the bone marrow (BM), lytic bone lesions, and immunodeﬁciency, associated with monoclonal protein in the blood
and/or urine. Despite recent advances in treatment, including
high-dose therapy and novel agents such as bortezomib,
thalidomide, and lenalidomide, MM remains incurable due to
development of drug resistance in the BM microenvironment
(1–4). The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway
plays a crucial role in survival, growth, and drug resistance of

different types of cancers, including MM (5–8). PI3K is activated via upstream tyrosine kinase–associated receptors by
various growth factors and/or cytokines, leading to phosphorylation and activation of the serine–threonine protein kinase
Akt. Many other proteins, including GSK3a/b and FKHR
proteins, are phosphorylated by activated Akt, and regulate
downstream signaling cascades to maintain cell proliferation,
survival, and protection against apoptosis (5, 9, 10). Moreover,
Akt also targets the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
pathway, which regulates cell metabolism and autophagy
(11, 12).
In MM, the BM microenvironment triggers PI3K/Akt signaling cascade via both physical interaction of MM cells with
BM stromal cells (BMSC) and soluble factors secreted from
BMSCs, including IL6 and IGF1 (13–16). Because activated
PI3K/Akt signaling mediates MM cell drug resistance, targeting Akt is a strategy to overcome drug resistance (7, 17, 18).
For example, we have shown that bortezomib activates Akt
(17), and that inhibition by a nonselective Akt inhibitor
perifosine (19, 20) can synergistically enhance bortezomibinduced cytotoxicity. Perifosine also induces antitumor activity in vivo in a murine xenograft model of human MM (17).
Moreover, a recent study has shown the in vitro efﬁcacy of a
selective Akt inhibitor MK-2206 (21). However, because

Selective Akt Inhibition and Proteasome Inhibition in MM

perifosine is not selective to Akt signaling (22) and MK-2206
was evaluated only in vitro, the biologic impact and preclinical
efﬁcacy of selective and potent Akt inhibition in MM have not
yet been fully elucidated.
In this study, we, therefore, examine the biologic impact of
selective and potent Akt inhibition in MM cells both in vitro
and in vivo by a novel small-molecule inhibitor TAS-117. These
studies provide the framework of clinical trials of TAS-117,
alone and in combination with proteasome inhibitors, to
improve patient outcome in MM.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
TAS-117 is trans-3-amino-1methyl-3-[4-(3-phenyl-5H- imidazo[1,2-c]pyrido[3,4-e][1,3]oxazin-2-yl)phenyl]-cyclobutanol.
Its chemical structure is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A.
TAS-117-HCl is TAS-117 monohydrochrolide. Bortezomib, carﬁlzomib, and perifosine were obtained from Selleck Chemicals.
Recombinant human IL6, IGF1, and TNFa were obtained from
R&D Systems.
Human MM cell lines and primary cells
For details on human MM cell lines and primary cells, see the
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Growth inhibition assay
The inhibitory effect of TAS-117 on MM cell growth was
assessed by measuring 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrasodium bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich) dye absorbance, as previously described (17), or using CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. To measure proliferation of MM
cells with or without BMSCs, the rate of DNA synthesis was
measured by [3H]-thymidine (PerkinElmer) uptake, as previously described (23).
Western blotting
MM cells were treated with or without novel or conventional
agents; cells were then harvested, washed, and lysed, as in prior
studies (17, 24). Cell lysates were subjected to SDS–PAGE,
transferred to membranes, and immunoblotted with antibodies. For details on antibodies, see the Supplementary Materials and Methods. Protein expression was quantiﬁed using
ImageJ (NIH).
Cell-cycle analysis and detection of apoptosis by ﬂow
cytometry
For cell-cycle analysis, MM cells treated with or without drug
were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
ﬁxed with 70% ethanol, and treated with 10 mg/mL RNase
(Roche Diagnosis). Cells were then stained with propidium
iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich). Detection of apoptotic cells was
done with the Annexin V/Detection Kit (Immunotech/Beckman Coulter), as previously described (25). Cell-cycle or apoptotic proﬁles were analyzed on a BD FACS Canto II (BD
Biosciences) using FACSDiva (BD Biosciences), with ModFit

www.aacrjournals.org

LT software for cell-cycle analysis. Annexin V–FITC1–positive
and PI-negative cells were considered as early apoptotic,
whereas positivity for both Annexin V–FITC1 and PI was
associated with late apoptosis or necrosis.
ELISA
IL6 secretion by human BMSCs was assessed by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). BMSCs were cultured in
96-well plates, with or without TAS-117. After 24 hours, supernatants were harvested and subjected to ELISA using the
DuoSet ELISA Development Kit (R&D Systems), according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
Murine xenograft models of human MM
For details on murine xenograft models of human MM, see
the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance was determined by the Student t test,
or the Dunnett multiple comparison test especially for tumor
volume. The minimal level of signiﬁcance was P < 0.05. Survival
was assessed using Kaplan–Meier curves and log-rank analysis.
The combined effect of TAS-117 with bortezomib or carﬁlzomib was analyzed by isobologram analysis using the CompuSyn software program (ComboSyn, Inc.).

Results
TAS-117 selectively inhibits Akt and induces cytotoxicity
in MM cells with high baseline phosphorylation of Akt
We ﬁrst examined the impact of inhibition of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) by a small-molecule allosteric Akt inhibitor
TAS-117, which inhibits Akt1, 2, and 3 with IC50 values of 4.8, 1.6,
and 44 nmol/L, respectively, with no or only minimal inhibitory
activities against other protein and lipid kinases, including
PI3K, PDK1, and mTOR, in enzyme assays at 1 mmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). Moreover, in the immunoprecipitation (IP) kinase assay using lysates prepared from MM.1S
cells, TAS-117 inhibited Akt kinase activity but not p-Akt
(Supplementary Fig. S1D), indicating that Akt activity is directly inhibited. TAS-117 blocked basal phosphorylation of Akt and
downstream p-FKHR/FKHRL1 (Fig. 1A) in MM cells with high
baseline p-Akt (Supplementary Fig. S2), but did not inhibit
autophosphorylation of PDK1, which phosphorylates Akt at
Thr308. This inhibitory effect was dose-dependent, with rapid
downregulation of p-Akt within 0.5 hours (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, TAS-117 did not inhibit other crucial pathways in MM;
indeed phosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK was increased
(Supplementary Fig. S3), as previously reported for another
allosteric Akt inhibitor (21). These data indicate that TAS-117
selectively inhibits Akt activity in MM cells. Next, we examined
cytotoxicity of TAS-117 in MM cells. TAS-117 induced significant growth inhibition in MM cell lines with high baseline pAkt, but not in cell lines with low baseline p-Akt, suggesting
that high baseline p-Akt reﬂects sensitivity to selective Akt
inhibition with TAS-117 (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S2).
Importantly, TAS-117 inhibited baseline p-Akt in patient MM
cells (Fig. 1D); and induced cytotoxicity in patient MM cells, but

microenvironment, associated with signiﬁcant inhibition of
p-Akt, and that TAS-117 has more potent inhibitory effect
than perifosine in the BM milieu. Moreover, increasing
serum concentrations in culture from 10% to 25% attenuated
cytotoxicity induced by perifosine but not by TAS-117 (Fig.
2C), further conﬁrming potency of TAS-117 in the BM
microenvironment.
Because Akt mediates NF-kB activity (14), we hypothesized that Akt inhibition by TAS-117 led to NF-kB inhibition,
which resulted in decreased secretion of IL6 from BMSCs.
TAS-117 inhibited phosphorylation of baseline Akt in
BMSCs, associated with reduced phosphorylation of NF-kB
p65 (Fig. 2D). Importantly, TAS-117 signiﬁcantly inhibited
baseline secretion of IL6 as well as TNFa-induced secretion
of IL6 from BMSCs (Fig. 2E), without affecting cell viability
(Supplementary Fig. S6). These results indicate that Akt
inhibition attenuates IL6 secretion from BMSCs by modulating the NF-kB pathway, leading to growth inhibition of
MM cells.
TAS-117 inhibits human MM cell growth in vivo
To evaluate the in vivo impact of TAS-117 treatment, we
used a subcutaneous xenograft model of human MM in
immunodeﬁcient mice. Oral administration of TAS-117 at
daily doses of both 12 and 16 mg/kg 5 days a week significantly reduced MM.1S tumor growth versus vehicle control
(at both doses, on day 18, P < 0.001; Fig. 3A). TAS-117
treatment for 3 weeks was well tolerated, without signiﬁcant
weight loss (Fig. 3B). Importantly, overall survival of TAS117–treated mice was signiﬁcantly prolonged in both 12 and
16 mg/kg cohorts (P < 0.05, and P < 0.001 vs. control,
respectively; Fig. 3C). To examine target inhibition by
TAS-117 in vivo, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of tumors. The expression of p-Akt was inhibited in
tumors harvested from TAS-117–treated mice (16 mg/kg)
after 5 days of treatment. TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells
were increased by the treatment (Fig. 3D), indicating that
TAS-117–induced apoptosis in MM cells is associated with
inhibition of p-Akt.
Using the H929 xenograft model, we further conﬁrmed
signiﬁcant growth inhibition by TAS-117–HCl on day 16 in
both 8 and 12 mg/kg cohorts (P < 0.05, and P < 0.01 vs. control,
respectively; Fig. 3E). These data suggest that the growth
inhibitory effect by TAS-117 in vivo is not cell line–speciﬁc.
In this study, we measured plasma exposure levels of TAS-117
in mice. At the dose of 8 mg/kg, it was 0.860, 1.311, and 0.019
mmol/L at 1, 4, and 24 hours after oral administration, respectively. At the dose of 12 mg/kg, it was 3.695, 2.069, and 0.016
mmol/L at 1, 4, and 24 hours after oral administration,
respectively.

TAS-117 triggers cytotoxicity by inducing apoptosis and
autophagy
To elucidate the mechanism of cytotoxicity triggered by
TAS-117, we performed FACS analysis. PI staining showed
increased G0–G1 phase in both MM.1S and H929 cells after
culture with TAS-117 for 24 hours (Fig. 4A). Moreover, Annexin
V/PI staining showed increased annexin-positive apoptotic
MM.1S and H929 cells after cultured with TAS-117 for 48 hours
(Fig. 4B). Apoptosis induction was also conﬁrmed by cleavage
of caspase-8, -3, and PARP (Supplementary Fig. S7). These
results suggest that cytotoxicity triggered by TAS-117 is associated with G0–G1 arrest, followed by apoptosis.
Because increase in annexin-positive cells or cleavage of
caspase and PARP induced by TAS-117 seems modest compared with signiﬁcant cytotoxicity in MM.1S and H929
observed in Fig. 1C, we hypothesized that TAS-117 also induces
other pathways leading to cell death. Because Akt inhibition
leads to induction of autophagy (27), we next examined
whether TAS-117 induced autophagy in MM cells. LC3-II was
induced by TAS-117 within 6 hours in both MM.1S and H929
cells (Fig. 4C), and autophagosome formation was also
observed (Supplementary Fig. S8), suggesting early induction
of autophagy. We further investigated expression of molecules
in the mTOR pathway mediating autophagy, downstream of
Akt. Although phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2448 was only
modestly reduced, phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase was
signiﬁcantly reduced by TAS-117 treatment, suggesting that
mTORC1 activity was inhibited (Fig. 4D). These results indicate
that TAS-117 may induce autophagy via inhibition of the Akt–
mTOR pathway.
The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) causes ER stress and triggers the cellularadaptive unfolded protein response (UPR; refs. 28–30). Akt
inhibition induces phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 2 (eIF2a), which is mediated by protein kinase
RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) in the UPR (31). Interestingly,
TAS-117 increased phosphorylation of eIF2a and inositolrequiring enzyme 1a (IRE1a) as well as induced IRE1a and
molecular chaperone BiP/GRP78, indicating that both PERK
and IRE1a pathways are activated (Fig. 4E). Importantly,
induction of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a transcription factor leading to apoptosis due to uncompensated ER
stress (32), was only modest. These results suggest that the ER
stress–induced apoptosis may only minimally contribute to
signiﬁcant cytotoxicity of TAS-117.

apoptosis (34). Moreover, we have previously shown that
bortezomib activates Akt; and conversely, that Akt inhibition
by perifosine with bortezomib triggers synergistic MM cell
cytotoxicity (17). Therefore, we next examined the efﬁcacy of
TAS-117 in combination with bortezomib. In MM.1S cells
expressing high baseline p-Akt, bortezomib caused increased
p-Akt, which was inhibited by TAS-117. TAS-117 enhanced
growth inhibition triggered by bortezomib, even in the presence of conditioned media derived from BMSCs (Fig. 5A).
Combination indices (CI) indicated synergistic cytotoxicity
(CI < 1.0) at higher doses of combination therapy (Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, Annexin V/PI staining showed
that TAS-117 strongly enhanced apoptosis induced by bortezomib (Fig. 5B). Importantly, Western blotting showed that
CHOP expression induced by bortezomib was enhanced by
TAS-117 and associated with increased PARP cleavage (Fig.
5C), suggesting that MM cells are dying, at least in part, due to
ER stress–induced apoptosis. Moreover, TAS-117 with bortezomib induced synergistic cytotoxicity (CI < 1.0) even in RPMI8226 cells with low baseline p-Akt (Fig. 5D; Supplementary
Table S2). As in MM.1S cells, bortezomib induced p-Akt in
RPMI-8226 cells, which was blocked by TAS-117 (Fig. 5E).
These results suggest that TAS-117 can enhance bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity in MM cells by inhibiting bortezomib-induced activation of Akt, regardless of baseline levels of
p-Akt, and enhancing ER stress–induced apoptosis.
TAS-117 enhances bortezomib-induced MM cytotoxicity
in vivo
To determine whether the combination of TAS-117 with
bortezomib is effective in vivo, we tested this combination
using the subcutaneous xenograft model of human MM in
mice. Treatment of TAS-117 in combination with low-dose
bortezomib for 3 weeks signiﬁcantly inhibited MM cell growth
versus control (day 18, P < 0.001), versus low-dose bortezomib
alone (day 22, P < 0.001), and versus TAS-117 alone (day 22, P <
0.01; Fig. 5F). Importantly, overall survival in TAS-117 with lowdose bortezomib-treated mice was signiﬁcantly prolonged
versus control (P < 0.001), versus low-dose bortezomib alone
(P < 0.01), and versus TAS-117 alone (P < 0.05)–treated cohorts
(Fig. 5G). Importantly, combination treatment of TAS-117 with
bortezomib was tolerable without weight loss (Supplementary
Fig. S9). These results demonstrate that TAS-117 in combination with bortezomib induces promising anti-MM activity and
tolerability in vivo.
TAS-117 enhances carﬁlzomib-induced cytotoxicity and
fatal ER stress in MM cells
Carﬁlzomib, a second generation proteasome inhibitor,
which irreversibly inhibits chymotryptic activity (35), has been
approved by the FDA to treat MM resistant to bortezomib (36).
As with bortezomib, carﬁlzomib also enhanced p-Akt in MM.1S
cells, which was blocked by TAS-117 (Fig. 6A, left). Moreover,
CHOP expression was induced by carﬁlzomib, indicating ER
stress, which was enhanced by TAS-117 and associated with
enhanced PARP cleavage (Fig. 6A, right). MTT assay showed
that TAS-117 enhanced cytotoxicity induced by carﬁlzomib,
even in the presence of conditioned medium derived from

panels are commonly used.

Selective Akt Inhibition and Proteasome Inhibition in MM

BMSCs (Fig. 6B). The combination of TAS-117 with carﬁlzomib
is more synergistic than with bortezomib (Supplementary
Table S3). Apoptotic cells induced by carﬁlzomib were significantly increased in combination with TAS-117, detected by
Annexin V/PI staining (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that
TAS-117 augments carﬁlzomib-induced apoptosis, at least in
part, via increased ER stress. As shown in combination with
bortezomib, TAS-117 in combination with carﬁlzomib induced
synergistic cytotoxicity in RPMI-8226 cells with low baseline of
p-Akt (Supplementary Fig. S10A and Supplementary Table S4),
associated with inhibition of p-Akt triggered by carﬁlzomib
(Supplementary Fig. S10B), suggesting the potential clinical
utility of this combination regardless of baseline levels of p-Akt.

Discussion
The PI3K/Akt pathway plays a crucial role in MM cell
growth, survival, and drug resistance (7, 11). Many MM cell
lines express high baseline levels of p-Akt; moreover, Akt is also
activated in patient MM cells (37). Perifosine interacts with the
cell membrane and modulates intracellular growth signaling
pathways, and has been developed as an Akt inhibitor for
clinical application (19, 20, 38). Indeed, we have previously
shown its efﬁcacy using both in vitro and in vivo preclinical MM
models (17) and in the phase I/II clinical trial (39); however, it is
not highly potent or selective, and phase III clinical trials
performed in MM (38) were terminated due to slow accrual
and limited resources; therefore, there remains a need for a
potent selective Akt inhibitor. More recently, a selective Akt
inhibitor MK-2206 has been reported to inhibit MM growth in
vitro, either alone or in combination with mTORC1 inhibitor,
PI3K inhibitor, or MEK1/2 inhibitor, suggesting the clinical
utility of a selective Akt inhibitor in MM (21). In this report, we
demonstrate the efﬁcacy of a novel potent and selective Akt
inhibitor TAS-117 in vitro and in vivo. TAS-117 does not inhibit
PDK1 and mTOR, the kinases responsible for phosphorylation
of Akt at Thr308 and Ser473, respectively, in enzyme assays.
TAS-117 does inhibit phosphorylation of p-FKHR/FKHRL1
downstream of Akt, but not PDK1 autophosphorylation
upstream of Akt in MM cells. In addition, in vitro Akt IP kinase
assay shows direct inhibition of Akt by TAS-117 in MM cells.
These data indicate that the target of TAS-117 in the PI3K/Akt
pathway is Akt. TAS-117 induces signiﬁcant growth inhibition
in MM cell lines with high baseline p-Akt, side population cells,
and patient MM cells, without affecting normal mononuclear
cells. Importantly, TAS-117 is more potent than perifosine in
high-serum conditions and in coculture with BMSCs. Finally,
TAS-117 inhibits human MM cell growth in vivo in xenograft
models. Our data, therefore, demonstrate the efﬁcacy of TAS117 against MM cells with high baseline p-Akt both in vitro and
in vivo, suggesting its potential clinical utility as a single-agent
especially for a subset of patient population with high baseline
p-Akt. Akt phosphorylation of MM cells may be used as a
biomarker for patient selection, as similarly suggested in the
study of MK-2206 (21).
The BM microenvironment triggers activation of multiple
signaling cascades in MM cells, including MEK/ERK, JAK2/
STAT, and PI3K/Akt (15, 16). Speciﬁcally, Akt is activated by

www.aacrjournals.org

cytokines such as IL6 and IGF1 in the BM milieu. Importantly,
TAS-117 induces signiﬁcant cytotoxicity in MM cells even in
the presence of BMSCs or cytokines, associated with blockade
of Akt activity. IL6 secretion from BMSCs is also inhibited by
TAS-117, associated with NF-kB inhibition. These data further
support potential clinical efﬁcacy of TAS-117, because it can
overcome the survival and growth advantage conferred in the
context of the BM. In addition, the Akt pathway in MM cells
with low baseline p-Akt in vitro can be activated in the BM
milieu, indicating possible broad application in clinical
practice.
We have shown that TAS-117 induces multiple apoptosis,
autophagy, and ER stress cell signaling pathways. Autophagy is
observed within 6 hours of TAS-117 treatment. In contrast,
apoptosis is observed at 24 to 48 hours. These results suggest
that early cytotoxic effects of TAS-117 are associated with
autophagy, whereas late cytotoxic effects are related to apoptosis. Interestingly, TAS-117 induces p-IRE1a, IRE1a, BiP/
GRP78, and p-eIF2a, which are upregulated by the UPR as an
adaptive cellular response to ER stress. In contrast, the induction of CHOP, a fatal ER stress marker, is only modest,
indicating that TAS-117 alone induces ER stress and the UPR
as an adaptive response. A recent study also shows that
phosphorylation of eIF2a in the PERK signaling pathway is
a cellular-adaptive response to Akt inhibition (31). Our data
further demonstrate that both PERK and IRE1a pathways are
activated by Akt inhibition in MM cells, indicating global ER
stress triggered by TAS-117. Cross-talk between the Akt pathway, ER stress, and the subsequent UPR is being delineated in
ongoing studies.
Proteasome inhibitors play a central role in MM treatment.
Bortezomib, the ﬁrst FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor, is a
major advance in MM; however, some patients do not respond
and most patients acquire resistance with time (4). Though
perifosine was reported to act synergistically with bortezomib
(17), it has not been elucidated whether selective Akt inhibition
triggers synergy with bortezomib. Importantly, we demonstrate that selective Akt inhibition by TAS-117 enhances bortezomib-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, TAS-117 blocks p-Akt
induced by bortezomib, suggesting a potential strategy to
overcome bortezomib resistance. We also show that TAS117 enhances cytotoxicity induced by carﬁlzomib, and blocks
carﬁlzomib-induced activation of Akt. Furthermore, TAS-117
enhances proteasome inhibitor–induced cytotoxicity even in
RPMI-8226 cells with low baseline p-Akt, because proteasome
inhibition by bortezomib or carﬁlzomib can increase p-Akt,
which is blocked by TAS-117. Taken together, these results
suggest that combinations of Akt inhibitors with proteasome
inhibitors represent a promising strategy for MM therapy
regardless of baseline p-Akt level in tumors.
Interestingly, CHOP expression induced by bortezomib is
enhanced by TAS-117: It enhances uncompensated ER stress
induced by bortezomib, leading to apoptosis. Carﬁlzomib also
induces CHOP expression, which is similarly enhanced by TAS117. Our data, therefore, demonstrate that the selective Akt
inhibitor TAS-117 enhances fatal ER stress induced by proteasome inhibitors in MM. We have recently reported that the
IRE1a endoribonuclease inhibitor MKC-3946 blocks XBP1

splicing, and thereby enhances fatal ER stress induced by
bortezomib (40). These combinations of ER stress enhancers
with proteasome inhibitors hold great clinical promise.
In summary, we demonstrate that selective and potent Akt
inhibition by TAS-117 triggers anti-MM activities in vitro and in
vivo, as well as enhances cytotoxicity induced by proteasome
inhibition. Our results provide the preclinical framework for
clinical trials of selective Akt inhibitors such as TAS-117, alone
and in combination with proteasome inhibitors, to improve
patient outcome in MM.
