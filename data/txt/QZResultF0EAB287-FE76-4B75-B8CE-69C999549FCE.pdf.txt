Abstract
Metastasis and drug resistance are the major causes of
mortality in patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including AXL, are
involved in the progression of NSCLC. The AXL/MER/SKY
subfamily is involved in cell adhesion, motility, angiogenesis,
and signal transduction and may play a significant role in the
invasiveness of cancer cells. Notably, no specific inhibitors
of AXL have been described. A series of CL1 sublines with progressive invasiveness established from a patient with NSCLC has
been identified that positively correlates with AXL expression
and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. The ectopic overexpression of AXL results in elevated cell invasiveness and drug
resistance. Nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) signaling activity is
associated with AXL expression and may play an important
role in the enhancement of invasiveness and doxorubicin
resistance, as shown by using the NF-KB inhibitor, sulfasalazine, and IKB dominant-negative transfectants. In the current
study, sulfasalazine exerted a synergistic anticancer effect with
doxorubicin and suppressed cancer cell invasiveness in
parallel in CL1 sublines and various AXL-expressing cancer
cell lines. Phosphorylation of AXL and other RTKs (ErbB2 and
epidermal growth factor receptor) was abolished by sulfasalazine within 15 min, suggesting that the inhibition of NF-KB
and the kinase activity of RTKs are involved in the pharmacologic effects of sulfasalazine. Our study suggests that AXL is
involved in NSCLC metastasis and drug resistance and may
therefore provide a molecular basis for RTK-targeted therapy
using sulfasalazine to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy in
NSCLC. [Cancer Res 2007;67(8):3878–87]

Introduction
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common and
lethal cancer in the world (1). Development of distant metastasis
after tumor resection is the leading cause of death in patients with
NSCLC (1, 2). The development of drug resistance in metastatic
tumor cells has become a major barrier to the efficacy of
chemotherapy (2). Several molecules have been implicated in
cancer cell invasiveness and metastasis. Specifically, the receptor

tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are involved in tumorigenesis of NSCLC
and may thus serve as potential markers for the prognosis and
metastatic potential in early-stage NSCLC (3). RTKs convey potent
signals that govern various aspects of cell behavior. Indeed,
aberrant signal transduction is often involved in the mechanism
underlying metastasis (3). In NSCLC, only a few RTKs [e.g.,
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB2] have been
thoroughly studied (3–5). AXL/MER/SKY is a new class of the RTK
subfamily that transduces crucial extracellular signals inside cells
(6). Proteins of this subfamily contain two extracellular fibronectin
type III domains (FN3) and two immunoglobulin-like domains (IG),
features that suggest an important role in the interaction between
the extracellular matrix and/or other cells (6). AXL, also known as
UFO, is a type I transmembrane RTK with transforming activity
(7, 8). An increased expression of AXL and increased interaction
between AXL and Gas6 have been implicated in antiapoptosis, cell
adhesion, and chemotaxis (9–11). The expression of AXL is clearly
associated with invasiveness and metastasis in various cancer cell
types and is implicated in the prognosis of patients with myeloid
leukemia (7, 12), metastatic lung cancer (13, 14), renal cell
carcinoma (15), prostatic carcinoma (16, 17), breast cancer (18),
and gastric cancer (19). Most recently, AXL was shown to affect
multiple cellular behaviors in angiogenesis (14, 20), and independently, blockage of AXL expression results in the suppressed
growth of cancer cells in a xenograft model (20). The role of Gas6AXL signaling in tumor growth and invasion is also supported by
the suppression of experimental gliomagenesis in vitro and in vivo
using a dominant-negative receptor mutant (AXL-DN; ref. 21).
Although some functional aspects of the AXL/MER/SKY family
have been deciphered (6), how these receptors mediate their
physiologic and pathologic consequences is not well understood. In
different cell types, downstream signaling of AXL has been reported
to be mediated through tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (9), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT (10, 22, 23), GTPases of the Rho
family (24, 25), glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3; ref. 26), nuclear
factor-nB (NF-nB; refs. 11, 27), extracellular signal-regulated kinases
(ERK; ref. 25), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (16, 17, 24).
Agents that interfere with AXL and its corresponding signaling
pathways may thus provide exciting opportunities for novel
therapeutic strategies in a wide range of AXL-associated human
malignancies.
Sulfasalazine is a synthetic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
composed of sulfapyridine, a sulfonamide antibiotic, linked via an
azo-bond to a 5-aminosalicylic acid moiety (28, 29). Sulfasalazine
and related aminosalicylates are commonly used in the management of inflammatory bowel diseases and rheumatoid arthritis
(28). The mechanism of action of sulfasalazine requires further
study; however, sulfasalazine has been shown to inhibit NF-nB

activation at multiple steps (29–32). Accordingly, small molecular
inhibitors of NF-nB, such as sulfasalazine, are likely to provide
novel opportunities for improved therapeutic strategies for cancer
patients (31, 33, 34).
There is a continuing need for genetically matched cell systems to
model cellular behaviors that are frequently observed in aggressive
NSCLC. CL1-1, CL1-2, CL1-3, CL1-4, and CL1-5 are a series of lung
adenocarcinoma cell lines with increasing invasiveness derived
from CL1-0 (35). The more invasive subline, CL1-5-F4, was derived
from lung metastases of severe combined immunodeficient mice
inoculated with CL1-5 cells (36). AXL is among the many genes
associated with the invasiveness of the CL1 series as determined by
microarray studies (36) and further investigated by Shieh et al. (14).
In the present study, we have shown that more invasive cells are
often more drug resistant and vice versa. Therefore, the CL1 series
of cell lines may serve as a good model for the development of
rationale therapies against highly aggressive and therapy-refractory
NSCLC. Stable clones of CL1-0 that ectopically overexpress AXL
and stable clones of CL1-5F4 with AXL expression knocked down
by short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–mediated silencing techniques were
established to elucidate the role of AXL in cell invasiveness. Our
observations have shown that the reintroduction of AXL into CL1-0
augments drug resistance and invasiveness and is accompanied by
activated NF-nB signaling. By comparison, highly invasive CL1-5F4
cells transfected with AXL shRNA vectors diminished NF-nB
signaling activities as well as cell invasiveness. The roles of NF-nB
signaling in enhanced invasive behavior and drug resistance were
shown by using the potent NF-nB inhibitor, sulfasalazine.
Disruption of chemoresistance and cell invasiveness by the
inhibition of NF-nB activation with sulfasalazine may therefore
be a useful new strategy for combination chemotherapies.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, reagents, and cell viability assay. A CL1 series of cell lines
(i.e., CL1-0, CL1-1, CL1-2, CL1-3, CL1-4, CL1-5, and CL1-5F4) was established
by selection of increasingly invasive cancer cell populations from a cell line
of human lung adenocarcinoma, CL1-0, using the Transwell invasion
chamber assay (35). The following inhibitors of NF-nB signaling were
purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and dissolved in DMSO
(Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO): 1-pyrrolidinecarbodithioic
acid (PDTC), 5-[4-(2-pyridylsulfamoyl) phenylazo]salicylic acid (sulfasalazine), and (E)3-[(4-methylphenyl) sulfonyl]-2-propenenitrile (Bay11-7082).
As a control, cells were treated with equal volumes of DMSO. Cell viability
was determined by the tetrazolium-based semiautomated colorimetric
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.
After 3 days of culture and drug exposure, when cells in the drug-free
control wells reached 90% confluence, the cell numbers were quantified
using the MTT method with an ELISA reader at A 492. The IC50 values are
averages of five independent experiments.
Construction of recombinant plasmids for AXL expression, AXL
deletion mutants, shRNA for AXL silencing, IKBA dominant-negative
mutants, and the NF-KB reporter. Single-stranded cDNA was reverse
transcribed from the total RNA of the human glioblastoma cell line DBTRG
(7, 8). A pair of primers (5¶-AGGAAAGTTTGGCACCCATG and 5¶-CAGGTGGAGGGTTGTCTCAG) was used in a PCR to amplify AXL cDNA. The
amplified 2,718-bp AXL cDNA fragment was cloned into the EcoRV site of
pcDNA3. The AXL recombinant plasmid was sequence verified to be 100%
identical to the published sequence, NM_021913. To define the domains of
AXL responsible for cell invasiveness, expression plasmids of five AXL
deletion mutants were constructed (6, 21, 25). The pAXLD(33–142) mutant
had the first IG domain deleted. The pAXLD(215–429) mutant had both of
the FN3 domains deleted. The pAXLD(215–326) and pAXLD(333–429)
mutants had the first and second FN3 domains deleted, respectively. The

pAXLD(517–894) mutant had the entire intracellular tyrosine kinase
domain deleted (Fig. 2D). All of the constructs were sequence verified.
Four AXL shRNA vectors were constructed in pRNA-U6.1/Neo (GenScript
Corp., Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
four AXL shRNA constructs contained the following sequence of the human
AXL gene (nucleotide positions as of NM_021913): 5¶-GAAAGAAGGAGACCCGTTA-3¶ (1882–1900), 5¶-GGTCAGAGCTGGAGGATTT-3¶ (2185–2203),
5¶-GGAACTGCATGCTGAATGA-3¶ (2485–2503), and 5¶-CCAAGAAGATCTACAATGG-3¶ (2539–2557). These constructs were sequence verified and
carried a neomycin resistance gene that was used to establish four stable
transfectants, designated as shAXL1882, shAXL2185, shAXL2485, and
shAXL2539. Expressions of these AXL shRNA were under control of the
U6 promoter. For inhibition of NF-nB signaling, sequences within the 72–
amino acid NH2-terminal region of InBa have been reported to be required
for inducible InBa degradation but dispensable for InBa binding to RelA/
p65 (37); therefore, this truncated mutant of human InBa mutant (pIjBDN)
with amino acids 2 to 71 deleted under cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter
control (parental plasmid was pBK-CMV; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was
applied as a dominant-negative for NF-nB activation in the current study.
The NF-nB–driven reporter plasmid (pRnB-Luc) was constructed by linking
the luciferase gene to five NF-nB binding sites and a TATA element (37).
In vitro cell migration and invasion assays. Invasiveness of the CL1
cell lines was examined by using a BioCoat Matrigel invasion chamber
system (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). The BD Matrigel Matrix is composed
of laminin, collagen IV, nidogen/entactin, and proteoglycan on polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) membranes containing 8-Am pores. In the in vitro
migration assay, low pore density PET track-etched membranes on Falcon
culture inserts (BD Biosciences) were applied. The membrane was placed
between the upper and lower wells of a Matrigel chamber or Falcon culture
inserts. The cells were first resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal
bovine serum and seeded into the upper wells of the chamber (50,000 cells
per well). After incubating for 24 h at 37jC, cells that invaded or migrated
through the membrane were stained with Liu stain (Handsel Technologies,
Inc., Taipei, Taiwan) and counted under a microscope. Each experiment was
repeated thrice.
Western blot analysis. The levels of RTKs and NF-nB proteins were
measured by Western blotting. The methods for preparation of the wholecell and nuclear proteins have been described previously (38). Each sample
equivalent of 50 Ag total protein was separated by 8% to 12% SDS-PAGE,
transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with
specific antibodies against AXL ( for the COOH terminus of AXL, a goat
polyclonal IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; for the NH2
terminus of AXL, MAB154, a mouse monoclonal IgG; R&D Systems, Inc.,
Minneapolis, MN), MER (a goat polyclonal IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology),

Inc. Danvers, MA), c-Met (a rabbit polyclonal IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), InBa (a rabbit polyclonal IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NF-nB p65
(a rabbit polyclonal IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phosphorylated AKT
(p-AKT; a rabbit polyclonal IgG; Biosource, Carlsbad, CA), phosphorylated
ERK (p-ERK; a mouse monoclonal IgG1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ERK1/2
(a goat polyclonal IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GSK3a/h (a rabbit
polyclonal IgG; Cell Signaling, Waltham, MA), h-catenin (a mouse IgG1; BD
Biosciences), actin (a rabbit polyclonal IgG; Sigma-Aldrich Chemical), and
SP-1 (a rabbit polyclonal IgG1; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). Actin and
SP-1 were used as internal controls for whole-cell and nuclear proteins,
respectively. Detection was done with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit
(Amersham, Inc., Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom).
NF-KB reporter assay. The transcriptional activity of NF-nB was
determined by the luciferase reporter assay as described previously
(39). The cells were cotransfected with the NF-nB reporter vector
(pGL2-luciferase reporter plasmid; Promega Co., Madison, WI) and the

efficiency. At the time of harvesting, cell lysates were prepared for assaying
luciferase activity according to the LucLite Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay
kit (Packard BioScience, Groningen, the Netherlands). All experiments were
done in triplicate.
Statistical analysis. The significance of differences in assays conducted
in the current study was done with the repeated measures ANOVA or the
Student-Newman-Keuls test as indicated.

Results
Increased potential of cell invasion was correlated with
drug resistance in CL1 sublines. The morphology and cell
invasiveness of the four CL1 sublines are shown in Fig. 1A and C,
respectively. Invasiveness through the basement membrane matrix
was 2.4-, 4.6-, and 5.3-fold for CL1-1, CL1-5, and CL1-5F4,
respectively, over that of the parental CL1-0 cells (P < 0.05, one-

way ANOVA). Similar results were also observed in cell migration
rates (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Therefore, the differences in
migration capacities may also contribute to the progressive
invasiveness among these CL1 sublines. Moreover, the anchorageindependent growth on soft agar also showed a similar trend
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). The parental CL1-0 cells were larger,
rounded, and epithelial-like in the monolayer culture, whereas the
more invasive CL1-5F4 cells were more spindle shaped and less
adhesive (Fig. 1A).
To characterize the sensitivities of these CL1 sublines to anticancer drugs, 25 traditional chemotherapeutic drugs of different
modes of action were screened using the MTT assay.6 CL1 sublines
had a gradual increase in their resistance to doxorubicin-induced

cytotoxicity, which paralleled the trends of cell invasiveness (i.e.,
CL1-0 < CL1-1 < CL1-5 < CL1-5F4; Fig. 1B).
Elevation of AXL in CL1 sublines was correlated with cell
invasiveness. Eight proteins (the AXL family, including AXL, MER,
and SKY and their common ligand, Gas6, and other RTKs, such as
EGFR, ErbB2, EphA2, and MET, implicated to be associated with
metastasis of NSCLC) were assayed by Western blot analysis across
all four CL1 sublines (Fig. 1D). Among these proteins, only AXL

showed a significant increase in parallel with invasiveness.
Immunohistochemical staining also showed positive signals of
AXL in the cytoplasm and membranes of CL1-5 cells; in comparison, only a very weak signal was observed in CL1-0 cells (Fig. 1A).
To further show a correlation between invasion and AXL expression, the Transwell invasion assay was done with CL1-1 cells, and
the invaded subpopulation and the noninvaded cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A) were assayed for their AXL transcript by a

semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. It was found that the
AXL transcript of the invaded cells (lower chamber) was f25-fold
higher than that of the noninvaded cells (upper chamber;
P < 0.01, Student’s paired t test; Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Ectopic overexpression of AXL in CL1-0 cells increased
migration ability and filopodia formation, and knockdown of
AXL expression in CL1-5F4 cells decreased migration ability.
To assess whether AXL potentiates cancer cell invasiveness, CL1-0
cells were transfected with plasmid harboring a full-length human
AXL-encoding cDNA. Four stable independent clones were isolated
and checked for their status of AXL expression and cell migration
abilities (Fig. 2B). The AXL expression levels of clones 16, 18, 14,
and 22 were 8-, 63-, 65-, and 62-fold, respectively, and the migration
potentials were 2.2-fold, 3.7-fold (P < 0.05, Student’s paired t test),
3.9-fold (P < 0.05, Student’s paired t test), and 5.1-fold (P < 0.01,
Student’s paired t test), respectively, when compared with those of
the mock-transfected CL1-0 cells. The morphology of clone 22
revealed remarkably increased filopodia formation (Fig. 2A, arrowheads) in the leading edge of the cells compared with the parental
CL1-0 cells, where few filopodia were observed (Fig. 2A).
RNA interference is a popular method for silencing gene
expression in a variety of systems. In the current study, CL1-5F4
was transfected with four shRNA constructs that targeted different

regions of the AXL transcripts. The levels of expression of AXL in
these stable transfectants were decreased by 90%, 68%, 99%, and 0%,
and migration rates decreased by 57% (P < 0.05, Student’s paired
t test), 34%, 67% (P < 0.01, Student’s paired t test), and 5% for
shAXL2539, shAXL2185, shAXL2485, and shAXL1882, respectively,
compared with those of the mock-transfected CL1-5F4 cells
(Fig. 2C). The shAXL2485 transfectant cells appeared to be larger,
rounder, and more polygonal shaped than the mock-transfected
CL1-5F4 cells, which were smaller and more spindle-like (Fig. 2A).
Ectopic overexpression of AXL and reduced expression of AXL by
RNA interference had little effect on cell viabilities and growth rates.
Both the NH2-terminal distal region and the COOH-terminal
tyrosine kinase domain were important for cell invasiveness.
To investigate whether the AXL-related invasiveness of CL1 cells
could be mapped to a specific region within the AXL protein, we
next constructed a series of truncated AXL mutants and checked
their effects on cell invasiveness (Fig. 2D). It seemed that among
the four domains tested, the first IG domain of the NH2 terminus
was most critical for the role of AXL in invasiveness, as shown
with the pAXLD(33–142) mutant. The tyrosine kinase domain was
also important, as shown with the pAXLD(517–894) mutant. In
contrast, the two FN3 domains were not as critical, as shown
with the two FN3 single-deletion mutants, pAXLD(215–326)

and pAXLD(333–429), and the FN3 double-deletion mutant,
pAXLD(215–429). The levels of expression of the wild-type and
various mutants of AXL proteins were relatively comparable as
assayed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2D, bottom).
Overexpression of AXL elevated drug resistance and cells
selected for drug resistance showed increased invasiveness.
The CL1-0AdrR and CL1-0VP16R sublines were derived from the
parental CL1-0 cells by exposure to increasing concentrations of
doxorubicin and VP16, respectively. The pAXL-CL1-0 stable transfectants were pooled populations overexpressing AXL. As shown in
Fig. 3A, while CL1-0AdrR seemed to be resistant to doxorubicin, as
expected and more interestingly, the ectopic overexpression of AXL
also conferred resistance to doxorubicin as measured by the MTT
assay (Fig. 3A). The doxorubicin IC50 was 0.65 Amol/L for pooled
pAXL-CL1-0, 3.2 Amol/L for CL1-0AdrR , and 0.26 Amol/L for the
parental CL1-0. The doxorubicin resistance of AXL-overexpressing
CL1-0 cells was also shown using a clonogenic assay in the
presence of 0.1 Amol/L doxorubicin (Fig. 3B). Moreover, drugresistant CL1-0AdrR and CL1-0VP16R cells both revealed significant
morphologic changes, with protruding filopodia in the peripheral
cytoplasmic area (Fig. 3C, arrowheads), which is indicative of
increased invasiveness. The invasiveness of these drug-resistant
sublines was all positively correlated with invasiveness (Fig. 3D,
top), and the levels of expression of the AXL protein were all
dramatically increased in these drug-resistant cells, as measured by
Western blot analysis (Fig. 3D, bottom).
To further evaluate the correlation of AXL levels and chemoresistance in cancer cells, a nonlinear regression analysis was done
(Supplementary Fig. S3). The results showed that the AXL levels of
expression were positively correlated with the resistance to doxorubicin in 52 human, 2 primate, and 3 rodent cancer or transformed
cell lines derived from different tissue types. Consistent with the
data shown in Fig. 3, doxorubicin-resistant cancer cells generally
expressed higher levels of the AXL protein.
Expression of AXL resulted in NF-KB activation. To elucidate
the mechanisms underlying AXL-associated invasiveness, ERKs,
AKT/PI3K, GSK3, h-catenin, and NF-nB signaling pathways, which
have been shown in previous studies (22–27) to be involved in the
regulation of AXL-mediated effects, were examined in both CL1-5F4
cells with AXL knocked down by shRNA-mediated silencing and
CL1-0 cells ectopically overexpressing AXL. NF-nB activity was
assessed by Western blot analysis of nuclear NF-nB p65 and
cytoplasmic InBa (Fig. 4A). Marked accumulation of nuclear NF-nB
and degradation of cytoplasmic InBa were detected in AXL-overexpressing clone 22 and further on addition of the Gas6 ligand. In
addition, nuclear NF-nB was diminished and cytoplasmic InBa was
increased in the AXL-knocked down transfectant shAXL2485,
suggesting that NF-nB is involved in the signaling pathway of AXL.

Although the levels of p-ERK, p-AKT, GSK3, and h-catenin were
much higher in CL1-5F4 than in CL1-0, neither ectopic overexpression of AXL nor knockdown of AXL expression significantly changed
the levels of these signal molecules (Supplementary Fig. S4A).

concentrations of doxorubicin in the
presence of PBS (rhombus), sulfasalazine,

(Wor ) at the IC10 (E) and IC30 dosages (n)
for 3 d. Relative cell viabilities are

The levels of NF-nB transcriptional activity in the AXLoverexpressing clone 22 and the shAXL2485 transfectant were
examined by the NF-nB–driven luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 4B).
NF-nB activity of the AXL-overexpressing CL1-0 clone 22 was 2.1fold (P < 0.05, Student’s paired t test) greater than that of the
parental CL1-0 cells, and the NF-nB activity was decreased by 54%
(P < 0.01, Student’s paired t test) in the AXL-silenced shAXL2485
transfectant compared with that of the parental CL1-5F4 cells. It
seems that the NF-nB activity was correlated with the level of
expression of AXL and the metastatic potential of CL1 sublines
(Figs. 1B and 4B).
NF-KB signaling pathway was involved in the enhancement
of invasiveness of CL1-5F4 cells. To elucidate the underlying
signaling mechanism of invasiveness, the effects of several
inhibitors of signaling pathways on cell invasion rates were
examined in CL1-5F4 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Among the
inhibitors tested, only the NF-nB inhibitors sulfasalazine and
Bay11-7082 (at IC30 and IC10, respectively) significantly diminished
the cell invasion rate of CL1-5F4 cells.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

To further elucidate the role of NF-nB signaling, we examined the
cell invasion rates of the CL1-5F4 and CL1-0 cells transfected with
dominant-negative InB plasmid (pIjBDN; Fig. 4C). Stable transfection of the pIjBDN vector significantly reduced the cell invasion
rate of CL1-5F4 cells (P < 0.05, compared with mock vector control,
Student’s paired t test). Expression of the dominant-negative InBa
protein was verified by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4C).
Sulfasalazine dramatically reversed drug resistance and
suppressed invasiveness of AXL-expressing cells. Treatment
with sulfasalazine and Bay11-7082 at IC30 for 1 day remarkably
diminished the cell invasion rate of pAXL-CL1-0 cells ectopically
overexpressing AXL (Fig. 5A). Treatment of these cells with
sulfasalazine and Bay11-7082 decreased the invasion rates by 78%
(P < 0.01, Student’s paired t test) and 74% (P < 0.05, Student’s paired
t test), respectively. Because CL1-5F4 cells were the most invasive
and most doxorubicin resistant in the CL1 series (Fig. 1B and C),
we also tested the effects of combining doxorubicin and various
inhibitors of signaling pathways in the CL1-5F4 subline (Fig. 5B).
Combination treatment of doxorubicin and sulfasalazine produced

the most marked effect in inhibiting cell proliferation. Sulfasalazine, at both IC10 (12.5 Amol/L) and IC30 (33 Amol/L), exerted a
significant synergism with doxorubicin in inhibiting cell growth.
The synergistic effect was not observed with other agents, such as
PDTC, wortmannin, and PD98059. Moreover, sulfasalazine significantly sensitized CL1-0/AdrR cells to doxorubicin (data not
shown).
To extend the observation made in CL1-5F4 cells that the
cytotoxicity of doxorubicin was potentiated by sulfasalazine, we also
showed that sulfasalazine and doxorubicin were a synergistic drug
combination in various AXL-expressing cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S5), whereas the combination of doxorubicin and
wortmannin did not exhibit a synergistic effect. Importantly, this
synergism was not apparent in pIjBDN-CL1-5F4 cells, suggesting
that NF-nB signaling plays a crucial role in the chemoresistance of
AXL-overexpressing cells (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Sulfasalazine concomitantly inhibited NF-KB activity, AXL
phosphorylation, and cell invasiveness. To further clarify the
molecular mechanism of action of sulfasalazine and determine its
effectiveness as an inhibitor of NF-nB, nB-specific promoter
reporter activity of the CL1-5F4 cells treated with sulfasalazine

was measured by the luciferase assay (Fig. 6A). The suppression of
NF-nB activity by pIjBDN in CL1-5F4 cells was accompanied by
a 50% decrease in cell invasion rate (P < 0.05, Student’s paired
t test; Figs. 4C and 6A). NF-nB reporter activity was suppressed
by sulfasalazine in a dose-dependent manner. Sulfasalazine also
decreased cell invasiveness in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05,
Student’s paired t test; Fig. 6B) at concentrations that did not
significantly affect cell proliferation.
The overexpression of many RTKs has been shown to result in
receptor phosphorylation and activation (6). We showed herein
that endogenously, as well as ectopically AXL-overexpressing
sublines, such as CL1-5F4 and pAXL-CL1-0 (clone 22), all expressed
elevated levels of phosphorylated AXL (p-AXL; Fig. 6C), and the
augmented phosphorylation activities were profoundly inhibited by
sulfasalazine by as early as 15 min (Fig. 6C, middle). Interestingly,
this inhibition seemed to be NF-nB independent because
sulfasalazine sustained this inhibition in the pIjBDN-CL1-5F4
cells. To verify the inhibitory effect of sulfasalazine on other
tyrosine kinase activity, the phosphorylated levels of ErbB2/neu
(pTyr1221/1222) and EGFR protein (pTyr1086) were also examined by
Western blotting (Fig. 6D). At a concentration of 200 Amol/L for

60 min, the phosphorylation of ErbB2/neu and EGFR protein was
moderately inhibited by sulfasalazine, suggesting some nonselective effect of sulfasalazine on kinase activities of RTKs.

Discussion
Understanding of the roles of RTKs in cancer pathobiology has
led to successful development of many therapeutic agents that
specifically target RTKs (40). Our study has provided molecular
genetic evidence that strongly correlates the expression of RTK AXL
with invasiveness and drug resistance. This was done by selection of
naturally occurring invasive and drug-resistant NSCLC clones and
by establishing cell lines with overexpression and suppression of
AXL protein. Ectopic overexpression of AXL was shown to increase
the migration ability and the formation of protruding filopodia
(Fig. 2B). Meanwhile, knockdown of AXL expression led to
decreased migration (Fig. 2C). Comprehensive analyses of RTK
expression profiles have revealed overexpression of AXL in clinical
specimens and cell lines of NSCLC patients (13, 14). Shieh et al. (14)
described the expression of AXL as statistically significant with
respect to lymph node status and the patient’s clinical stage (P <
0.0001) in 58 patients. Our observation further strengthens the
association of AXL expression and NSCLC metastasis.
The AXL subfamily members each possess two NH2-terminal IG
domains and two FN3 repeats in their extracellular regions (6). In
the present study, using a series of truncated AXL mutants
(Fig. 2D), we have shown that deletion of the first IG domain of
AXL dramatically affects AXL-mediated cell invasiveness. Recently,
Sasaki et al. (41) reported the crystal structure and mutational
analysis of a minimal Gas6-AXL complex. The demonstrated highaffinity sites of Glu56Axl and Glu59Axl interacting with Gas6 are
within this region (41). Our findings suggest that the Gas6-binding
motif of the first IG domain is crucial for cell invasiveness. This
assumption is further supported by our observation using small
interfering RNA and the soluble AXL-extracellular decoy domain
(AXL-Fc chimeras) that suppression of the level of Gas6 or AXLGas6 binding partially abolished the enhanced invasiveness of
AXL-expressing CL1-0 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A and B). The
phosphorylation status of AXL was decreased in the Gas6
knockdown cells and the AXL-Fc–treated cells as measured by
immunoprecipitation/Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S6C).
Therefore, the expressed levels and binding activities of Gas6 seem
to play a moderate role in enhanced cell invasiveness. Based on our
observations, the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, in contrast
to the two FN3 domains, was also involved in the enhancement of
cell invasiveness (Fig. 2D). Because AXL autophosphorylation,
downstream signal transduction, as well as the oncogenic potential
of AXL all lie within the tyrosine kinase domain (6, 27), enhanced
cell invasiveness seems to be closely associated with kinase activity.
In contrast to the role of AXL in cancer metastasis, the
possibility of AXL playing a role in drug resistance remains to be
determined. Although it has been well documented that AXL
family-Gas6 signaling is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis
mediated by various exogenous stimuli (6, 23, 25, 26), whether AXL
plays a role in the prevention of apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs is still unknown. Another report showed the
overexpression of AXL in a cisplatin-resistant ovarian carcinoma
cell line (42). Our present observation is the first report showing a
strong association between AXL expression and doxorubicin
resistance in the drug-resistant CL1 variants and various cancer
cell lines as shown by regression analysis (Fig. 3A and D;

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

Supplementary Fig. S3). Because overexpression of AXL ectopically
simultaneously conferred invasiveness and drug resistance
(Figs. 2A and 3A and B) and because the drug-resistant variants
concomitantly showed an increase in invasiveness and AXL
expression (Fig. 3C and D), a link between AXL and the
codevelopment of invasiveness and drug resistance may exist.
Further, based on our observations, resistance to doxorubicin was
significantly elevated by AXL expression because doxorubicin, an
inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II, is also a well-known substrate of
p-glycoprotein and other members of the ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) family, and it remains to be clarified whether ABC genes or
other genes are involved in AXL-related drug resistance. We have
preliminarily observed that ABC proteins are not related with drug
resistance and AXL expression in this CL1 series.6 We have observed
previously that NF-nB is activated in cells challenged with various
major anticancer drugs (38), and in the present study, we showed
that NF-nB activation seemed to be the most important event for the
development of drug resistance of the AXL-expressing cells in several
ways. First, NF-nB activity was positively correlated with the levels of
expression of AXL (Figs. 1D and 4B). Second, the ectopic overexpression of AXL invariably increased NF-nB activity and resistance
to doxorubicin (Figs. 3A and B and 4A and B). Third, knockdown of
AXL expression showed a concomitant decrease in NF-nB activity
(Fig. 4A and B). Finally, treatment of cells with NF-nB inhibitors,
sulfasalazine and Bay11-7082, as well as transfection with a
dominant-negative InB all synergistically diminished drug resistance
of CL1-5F4 cells and the AXL-overexpressing CL1-0 cells (Fig. 5B;
Supplementary Fig. S5). Additionally, elevated NF-nB activities, as
examined by the luciferase reporter assay, were also shown in drugresistant CL1-0/AdrR and CL1-0/VP16R cells (data not shown).
Elevated NF-nB activity has been observed to be prevalent in lung
cancer patients (43). In our previous studies, the suppression of
NF-nB activity was found to increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutics (37, 38). In the current study, the disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, sulfasalazine, was found to dramatically reverse the
drug resistance and invasiveness of NSCLC cells and concomitantly
inhibited NF-nB activity and AXL phosphorylation (Figs. 5 and 6).
What remains to be investigated is the mechanism underlying the
suppression of cell invasiveness and drug resistance by sulfasalazine.
Sulfasalazine is a cell-permeable nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
agent that specifically inhibits NF-nB–dependent transactivation
through direct inhibition of InB kinase (IKK)-a and IKK-h by
antagonizing ATP binding (29, 30). In our study, sulfasalazine is more
potent than PDTC and Bay11-7082 in inhibiting invasiveness and
conferring synergism with doxorubicin (Fig. 5A and B), and this
strong synergistic effect was dramatic and observed in all cell lines
tested (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. S5). Awasthi et al. (44) reported
that clinically achievable concentrations of sulfasalazine modulate
cisplatin resistance in two human SCLC lines. Reports by Arlt et al.
(31, 33, 34) showed the use of sulfasalazine as a sensitizing agent in
combination with VP16 or doxorubicin in pancreatic carcinoma
cells. The spectrum and degree of possible synergistic effects
induced by sulfasalazine in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic agents warrant further evaluation.
Targeted therapies are now emerging as an important strategy in
the treatment of advanced NSCLC (4, 5). Thus far, several smallmolecule RTK inhibitors have been developed as potential
anticancer drugs (40). It is worth noting that overexpression of
AXL in several cell lines has been found to result in receptor
activation (41, 45). As shown herein, sulfasalazine inhibited not only
NF-nB but also phosphorylation of AXL (Fig. 6C), and this inhibition

of AXL phosphorylation was also observed in pInBDN-CL1-5F4
cells, suggesting a NF-nB–independent mechanism of the sulfasalazine effects. In this respect, it is noteworthy that sulfasalazine was
also found to augment cancer therapy in a NF-nB–independent
manner (46, 47). Possible adverse effects induced by sulfasalazine on
the enzymatic activity of RTK should be further evaluated because
the expressed levels of p-ErbB2/neu and EGFR were also inhibited,
although moderately, by sulfasalazine at 200 Amol/L (Fig. 6D). The
concentrations of sulfasalazine used in this study are clinically
achievable (32, 47). The mechanism of the effects of sulfasalazine on
AXL kinase activity needs to be further investigated.
Taken together, our observations indicate that NF-nB signaling
pathway is involved in the AXL-associated invasiveness and drug
resistance, and the dual inhibition of NF-nB and AXL phosphor-

ylation by sulfasalazine may provide an opportunity to effectively
attenuate the invasiveness and drug resistance of NSCLC cells. For
those refractory and/or metastatic cancers that express high levels
of NF-nB and AXL, this synergism observed between sulfasalazine
and doxorubicin and/or other chemotherapeutic agents is of
enormous value and importance.
