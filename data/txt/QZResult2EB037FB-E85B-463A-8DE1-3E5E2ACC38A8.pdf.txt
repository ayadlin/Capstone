ABSTRACT
Anterior Gradient 2 (AGR2) is a protein expressed in many solid tumor types
including prostate, pancreatic, breast and lung. AGR2 functions as a protein disulfide
isomerase in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, AGR2 is secreted by cancer cells
that overexpress this molecule. Secretion of AGR2 was also found in salamander limb
regeneration. Due to its ubiquity, tumor secretion of AGR2 must serve an important
role in cancer, yet its molecular function is largely unknown. This study examined the
effect of cancer-secreted AGR2 on normal cells. Prostate stromal cells were cultured,
and tissue digestion media containing AGR2 prepared from prostate primary cancer
10-076 CP and adenocarcinoma LuCaP 70CR xenograft were added. The control
were tissue digestion media containing no AGR2 prepared from benign prostate 10076 NP and small cell carcinoma LuCaP 145.1 xenograft. In the presence of tumorsecreted AGR2, the stromal cells were found to undergo programmed cell death (PCD)
characterized by formation of cellular blebs, cell shrinkage, and DNA fragmentation
as seen when the stromal cells were UV irradiated or treated by a pro-apoptotic
drug. PCD could be prevented with the addition of the monoclonal AGR2-neutralizing
antibody P3A5. DNA microarray analysis of LuCaP 70CR media-treated vs. LuCaP 145.1
media-treated cells showed downregulation of the gene SAT1 as a major change in
cells exposed to AGR2. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the array result. SAT1 encodes
spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase, which maintains intracellular polyamine
levels. Abnormal polyamine metabolism as a result of altered SAT1 activity has an
adverse effect on cells through the induction of PCD.

secretory cells, CD104+ basal epithelial cells and CD49a+
stromal cells [3]. In tumor glands only two major cell
types are distinguished: CD26+ cancer epithelial cells
and CD90+ cancer-associated stromal cells [4, 5]. Both
CD104+ basal cells and CD49a+ normal stromal cells are
missing. The cause of the disappearance of these cell types
is unknown.
In prostate cancer, a majority of primary prostate
tumors show elevated expression of anterior gradient 2
(AGR2) [6]. Many prostate cancer metastases in advanced
diseases also show high AGR2 expression [7]. AGR2

INTRODUCTION
In the tumor microenvironment, cancer cells interact
with surrounding cells in likely different pathways. The
interaction between cancer cells and other cells could be
mediated by cell-cell contact and diffusible molecules.
For example, cell-cell contact mediates expression of
prostate-specific antigen in the prostate [1]. Small miRNA
in vesicles are transported from producer cell to recipient
cell to alter gene expression [2]. In benign prostate glands,
three major cell types can be distinguished: CD26+ luminal

is a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) localized to the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [8]. Expression of AGR2
is found in many solid tumor types including prostate,
pancreatic, breast, lung, gastrointestinal and oral [9]. More
significantly, cancer cells secrete AGR2 and the protein is
found on the cell surface [10-12], whereas normal AGR2+
cells do not have expression on the cell surface as the
protein is not secreted and is localized to the cell interior
[13]. A non-canonical ER retention motif (C-terminal
KTEL) in AGR2 may be responsible for diverse trafficking
of this molecule [14, 15]. Reported functional attributes
of AGR2 in cancer include growth promotion and
dissemination. Cell lines transfected with AGR2 produced
metastasis [16] and gained anchorage-independent growth
[17]. AGR2 expression was up-regulated in a gastric
cancer cell subline with high metastatic potential for
invasion to lymph nodes [18]. Cancer-secreted AGR2
could activate stromal fibroblasts (cancer-associated
stromal cells vs. normal tissue stromal cells) to promote
fibroblast associated cancer invasion of gastric cancer
cells [19]. AGR2 could activate ER stress response genes
[11], to stimulate cell proliferation of AGR2-negative
pancreatic tumor cells, and to enhance drug resistance
[10]. Cell surface AGR2 could alter signaling pathways by
modulating other cell surface proteins through its disulfide
isomerization activity [9]. Other functional aspects for
AGR2 reported in the literature include regulation of
amphiregulin expression [20], promotion of cell adhesion
[21], cancer spread via regulation of cathepsins [11], and
cancer cell survival [10].
The cancer-specific secretion of AGR2 indicates an
important functional role in cell-cell communication. In
salamander limb regeneration, secreted AGR2 was shown
to trigger cellular differentiation in responding cells via
the receptor Prod1 [22]. In this work, we investigated the
effect of cancer-secreted AGR2 on normal prostate stromal
cells in culture.

was positive for AGR2 but at a lower level than those of
the adenocarcinoma lines. It could represent a small cell
carcinoma with some AGR2 expression or a mixed small
cell carcinoma/adenocarcinoma. AGR2 concentration
ranged from >100 pg/ml for LuCaP 70CR to <2pg/ml
for LuCaP 145.1. For the following culture experiments,
media of AGR2+ LuCaP 70CR [established from an
autopsied liver metastasis, expressed wild type androgen
receptor (AR) and moderate level of prostate-specific
antigen (PSA)] and AGR2− LuCaP 145.1 (established from
a liver metastasis, expressed no AR and PSA) were used.
Immunostaining of adenocarcinoma (in a bone metastasis)
and small cell carcinoma (in a liver metastasis) obtained
from autopsies showed the difference in AGR2 expression
between these two cancer types (Figure 2). In the small
cell carcinoma section, liver cells adjacent to the tumor
mass were moderately stained for AGR2 expression
whereas the tumor cells were completely unstained (note
that AGR2 in normal cells such as bladder urothelial cells
is not secreted [13]). Surgically resected primary tumors
were also processed for tissue digestion [1]. Benign tissue
(NP) media contained no AGR2 in contrast to tumor
tissue (CP) media. Western blot data in Figure 1 show the
presence of secreted AGR2 of 19 kDa in size in two CP
media and its absence in the corresponding matched NP
media. AGR2 was found to be the most abundant secreted
proteins of <20 (besides prostate-specific antigen, prostatic
acid phosphatase) produced by prostate cancer cells [4,
12]. Media of sample 10-076 CP and the matched 10-076
NP were used for culture because of their large volume.
Immunostaining of prostate primary tumors was reported
previously, where most of the cases stained were positive
for AGR2 [6].

Induction of cellular abnormalities by AGR2 on
NP stromal cells
Normal prostate stromal (NP strom) cells were
prepared from benign tissue specimens and cultured in
serum-supplemented media [25]. Near confluence, half
of the media was replaced by the various tissue digestion
media described above. Low passage NP strom cells
incubated with AGR2+ LuCaP 70CR digestion media
showed cellular blebbing or clustered protrusions of the
plasma membrane compared to those with AGR2− LuCaP
145.1 media (Figure 3A). These abnormalities were also
observed for NP strom cells with AGR2+ 10-076 CP media
compared to those with AGR2− 10-076 NP media (Figure
3B). Cell shrinkage was evident with cells showing a
“bright halo” around the abnormalities (Figure 3C). Such
a visual change was also reported for oral fibroblasts
undergoing apoptosis [26]. As could be observed, nearly
all the cells in the AGR2-containing cultures showed
these morphological changes. After ~24 h, there were no
viable cells in the LuCaP 70CR and 10-076 CP cultures
while cells in the LuCaP 145.1 and 10-076 NP cultures

RESULTS
Secreted AGR2 in tumor tissue digestion media
The LuCaP prostate cancer xenograft lines [23]
established from primary neoplasm and metastases
were either AGR2+ adenocarcinoma or AGR2− small
cell carcinoma [7]. The tumors were harvested from
mice and digested by collagenase. The cell-free media
supernatant contained proteins secreted or released
by the human tumor cells [24]. AGR2 in the cell-free
digestion media was measured by ELISA (Figure 1).
All the adenocarcinoma media tested were positive for
AGR2 as shown for LuCaP 23.1, LuCaP 23.12, LuCaP
70CR, and LuCaP 35CR (CR = castration resistant). In
contrast, the small cell carcinoma LuCaP 145.1 media
was near buffer background. A sister line LuCaP 145.2

remained healthy. AGR2 was a major common molecule
in the media of LuCaP 70CR and 10-076 CP as indicated
by strong immunostaining of the respective tumor tissue
[6, 7]. CP media differed chiefly from LuCaP media in the
presence of molecules secreted by the cancer-associated
stromal cells and other minor cell types of the primary
tumor, which were absent in the xenografts. Xenograft
tumors also contained infiltrating mouse cells. That AGR2
was the causative factor was shown by the addition of
anti-AGR2 monoclonal P3A5 in the culture. P3A5 was
developed for use in AGR2 ELISA [12]. The effect of
AGR2 was neutralized, and the cellular abnormalities
were not seen (Figure 3D). Other AGR2+ adenocarcinoma
LuCaP media (not shown) as well as collagenase digestion

media of metastasis samples obtained directly from donor
autopsies (Figure 3E) produced the same result. AGR2
levels in these other tissue media were measured by
ELISA as documented previously [12]. The exogenously
added bacterial collagenase could not produce the effect
since it was present in all media preparations.

Induction of DNA fragmentation in treated cells
by AGR2
RNA was isolated from the treated NP strom cells
and analyzed by Agilent Bioanalyzer. The Bioanalyzer
profile of untreated NP strom cells displayed intact
28S and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and faint traces

of mRNA. However, the isolated RNA from LuCaP
70CR-treated NP strom cells showed, in addition, low
molecular weight DNA fragments but that from LuCaP
145.1-treated cells did not (Figure 4A). Although the
RNA isolation kit was designed for RNA purification, any
small DNA present in the sample could also be captured
[27]. Exogenously added RNA would prevent binding of
DNA in the sample. The presence of intact 28S and 18S
rRNA indicated no RNA degradation in the affected NP

strom cells. DNA degradation without RNA degradation
was diagnostic of programmed cell death (PCD)/apoptosis
[28], as was formation of cellular abnormalities. In
contrast, cell necrosis as caused by electroporation of NP
strom cells led to both DNA and RNA degradation with no
intact rRNA bands (Figure 4B). No DNA fragmentation
was seen with added P3A5 antibody in the culture of
LuCaP 70CR-treated NP strom cells (Figure 4A, lane
2). As positive controls of PCD, NP strom cells were

probesets at the top of the gene listing display showing
a 2e+05 fold difference in Figure 5. The differentially
expressed genes (blue vs. red) encoded by the probesets
in the figure are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Other
down-regulated genes included ribosomal subunit protein
RPL23a, COX6C, COX2, and prothymosin-like α. The
latter was reported in the literature to possess an antiapoptotic function [29]. In contrast, not many genes were
affected in cells exposed to AGR2− LuCaP 145.1 media.

Down-regulation of SAT1 in cells cultured in the
presence of AGR2
The RNA (without DNA fragments, i.e., preceding
DNA fragmentation) from LuCaP 70CR- and LuCaP
145.1-treated NP strom cells was analyzed by Affymetrix
DNA microarrays for differential gene expression. The
result showed that only a small number of differentially
expressed genes (<30 of 54,675) were detected between
the two. A major difference was the down-regulation
of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SAT1)
in AGR2-treated NP strom cells with all three SAT1

RT-PCR verification of the SAT1 array result
Down-regulation of SAT1 in LuCaP 70CR-treated
NP strom cells was verified by RT-PCR analysis. The
SAT1 PCR product showed a lower band intensity in
NP strom + LuCaP 70CR than NP strom + LuCaP 145.1
(Figure 6) in agreement with the quantitative (signal
intensity values) difference found by the array analysis.
B2M beta2-microglobulin served as the reaction control,

whose PCR band showed similar intensity in all the RNA
tested. The data also showed that SAT1 expression was
not affected in NP strom + LuCaP 70CR + anti-AGR2
P3A5. SAT1 expression was also down-regulated in UVirradiated NP strom cells.

is CD59. Whether CD59 is responsible for transducing
the effect of AGR2 is at present unknown. Both NP strom
and prostate basal cells are immunostained by anti-CD59
[34]. Cells without CD59 might, therefore, be resistant to
the effect of AGR2. Another possible future study could
determine the effect of secreted AGR2 on stem cells such
as the induced pluripotent stem cells generated from
reprogramming of prostate stromal cells [35], given its
function in organ regeneration.
The immediate effect of AGR2 appears to be the
down-regulation of SAT1, which was also observed in UVirradiated cells. PCD can be triggered by many stimuli,
both physiological and non-physiological. The downregulation of SAT1 by AGR2 treatment and irradiation,
which in turn affects intracellular polyamine levels, could
be the trigger to initiate the PCD response. SAT1 is a key
enzyme in the maintenance of intracellular polyamine
levels through acetylation of its substrates for conversion
to putrescine [36]. Polyamines have a global effect on
gene transcription, and perturb action of ion channels to
cause cell shrinkage as seen in PCD [37]. One of the ion
channel genes affected in LuCaP 70CR-treated cells was
ATP1B1, the product of which functions in maintaining
electrochemical gradients of Na and K ions across the
plasma membrane. Thus, an abnormal level of polyamines
as a result of lower SAT1 activity produces an adverse
effect on cells leading to cell death [38]. A link between
tumor resistance to ionizing radiation and overexpression
of SAT1 was recently reported in brain cancer [39]. This
finding provided support for SAT1 expression loss induced
by irradiation. Other research data linked depletion of
intracellular polyamines through increased SAT1 activity
to cell death as well [40, 41]. For example, in EBVpositive lymphoma cell clones SAT1 activity is lowered
compared with EBV-negative cell clones, which promoted
cell growth [42].
In summary, secretion and cell surface expression of
AGR2 are specific to many solid tumors. Cancer-secreted
AGR2 induces cell death in normal (prostate stromal)
cells with down-regulation of SAT1, which is involved
in polyamine metabolism. In prostate cancer metastasis,
the tumor-derived AGR2 could contribute significantly
to organ failure with the destruction of normal cells. The
PCD-inducing property of AGR2 may be responsible for
the irreversible loss of body mass in cancer cachexia.
Thus, minimizing its deleterious effect by the use of antiAGR2 agents may prove clinically beneficial.

DISCUSSION
In normal cells, AGR2 functions as a PDI in the ER.
In cancer cells, AGR2 is also secreted. Cancer secretion
could be due to saturation of the ER receptor sites as AGR2
is over-expressed in cancer cells. The functional role of
cancer-secreted AGR2 on neighboring cells is unknown.
Here, we showed that secreted AGR2 could induce
formation of cellular protrusions in prostate stromal cells
in culture, which is due to the loss of cytoskeletal integrity.
This was followed by chromosomal DNA fragmentation.
These features are well-known characteristics PCD [28,
30, 31]. In the culture experiments, the source of AGR2
was prostate primary tumors, prostate adenocarcinoma
xenografts, as well as prostate cancer metastases. Although
we cannot definitively rule out other molecules present
in the PCD-inducing tissue digestion media but absent
in media of benign prostate and a small cell carcinoma
xenograft, AGR2 is a common high abundance molecule
among these sources. Furthermore, anti-AGR2 P3A5
antibody could prevent cellular abnormalities and DNA
breakdown when added to the AGR2+ culture media. We
are currently devising a protocol to purify AGR2 from
tissue culture media of prostate cancer cell lines PC3 or
CL1 [12] for use in future experiments. Purified AGR2
will also allow us to identify any structural differences in
the secreted form of the protein vs. the ER-localized form.
We used prostate stromal cells first to study the
effect of extracellular AGR2 because these normal cells are
readily obtainable in sufficient amounts after culture from
donated surgical specimens. In prostate tumor glands in
vivo, the stromal cells adjacent to the AGR2+ cancer cells
are CD90+ cancer-associated (CP) stromal cells, which
differ from NP stromal cells in overall gene expression
[5]. At least a 20-cell length separates the tumor epithelial
cells from NP stromal cells of adjacent benign glands [32].
Whether the CP stromal cells, like NP stromal cells, are
susceptible to AGR2-induced PCD in culture remains to
be determined, which would require cell isolation from
a sizable surgical specimen by using CD90 antibodies.
PCD induced by AGR2 could also explain the absence
of CD104+ basal epithelial cells in prostate tumor glands
[32], which is a diagnostic criterion for prostate cancer.
Additionally, cancer-secreted AGR2 could facilitate tumor
spread by inducing PCD in endothelial cells of the vessel
lining, making blood vessels leaky to allow access by the
cancer cells [33].

media was prepared from enzymatic digestion of tissue
specimens - surgically resected prostates and LuCaP
prostate cancer xenografts (established from tumor
specimens obtained from patients implanted in immunecompromised mice) - in RPMI1640 supplemented with
5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and gentamycin sulfate
[1]. Three ml media and collagenase were added to 0.1
g minced tissue specimens. After tissue digestion, ~1 h
for xenografts to overnight for surgical specimens, the
media was diluted by an equal volume of Hanks balanced
salt solution (HBSS), passed through a cell strainer, and
centrifuged. The cell-free supernatant contained secreted
molecules such as AGR2. Since tissue digestion was
carried out similarly between 10-076 CP and 10-076
NP (control), LuCaP 70CR and LuCaP 145.1 (control),
the media of all four would be “contaminated” by more
or less the same cytoplasmic proteins. The 10-076 CP
tumor tissue sample was carefully microdissected by our
pathologist colleague to ensure minimal “contamination”
of benign tissue. The collected tissue was processed
immediately so necrosis was minimal. The amount of
AGR2 in these media preparations was measured by our
sandwich ELISA [12] or detected by Western blotting. In
ELISA, recombinant AGR2 (GenWay Biotech, San Diego,
CA) was used to generate a standard curve for calibration.
BD Falcon plates (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) were
coated with 1:1,000 purified anti-AGR2 monoclonal P1G4
(IgG1) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), rinsed with
PBS-0.05% Tween, and blocked with 1% heat-denatured
bovine serum albumin. The media samples were added for
incubation at 4° overnight. For detection, 1:1,000 purified
anti-AGR2 monoclonal P3A5 (IgG2a) was used, followed
by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG2a. The chromogen
was 2,2’-azinobis[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]diammonium salt (KPL/Fisher, Belgium), and the reaction
was scored at λ= 405 nm. The cell-free media supernatants
were stored frozen, and no significant loss of AGR2
was detected over several years. In Western blot, gel
electrophoresis was carried out under reducing conditions,
and AGR2 was detected by P1G4 (1:19) followed by
secondary anti-mouse IgG1 (1:1,000). Matched digestion
media samples of 06-013 NP and 06-013 CP (NP = benign
prostate, CP = prostate cancer) Gleason score 3+4, 08-031
NP and 08-031 CP Gleason score 3+4 were compared for
the level of AGR2. Equal gel loading of the samples was
verified by Western blot of prostate-specific antigen. The
Western blot data confirmed immunohistochemistry of
benign prostate tissue showing no AGR2 expression.
The media used in this study were prepared from
primary prostate cancer AGR2-positive 10-076 CP
(Gleason score 5+4+3, tumor volume of 5.5 cc) and
AGR2-negative 10-076 NP matched benign (i.e., distal to
the tumor area); AGR2-positive adenocarcinoma xenograft
LuCaP 70CR and AGR2-negative small cell carcinoma
xenograft LuCaP 145.1.

Normal prostate stromal cells (NP strom) were
cultured from resected fresh tissue pieces [25]. The tissue
was minced and seeded on plastic plates with RPMI1640 +
10% FBS, 37°C. When outgrowths from the tissue pieces
were evident after one week, the cells were trypsinized and
passaged. Due to the lower plating efficiency of epithelial
cells, these cells were eliminated after a few passages.
In culture, NP strom cells displayed a fibroblastic-like
morphology. Previously, DNA microarray analysis of
cultured NP strom cells derived from multiple patient
specimens showed a similar gene expression to each other
[43]. Cells obtained from specimen 14-089 NP were used
in the study. NP strom cells at low passage number were
stored frozen and thawed as needed.

Treatment of NP strom cells
NP strom cells were cultured in 6-well BD Falcon
plates (Fisher Scientific). At near confluence, half of
the culture media was replaced by the various tissue
digestion media. At different times of incubation, the
cells were washed with HBSS and photographed under
magnification. The treated cells were then trypsinized
for RNA isolation. Small DNA molecules, if present,
could be isolated by the RNA isolation kit (Ambion Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) used. The RNA preparations
were analyzed by Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA). DNA microarrays - Affymetrix HU133
Plus 2.0 GeneChips - were used to analyze for differential
gene expression of NP strom cells treated by LuCaP 70CR
vs. LuCaP 145.1 media. Monoclonal AGR2 antibody P3A5
was added (50 μl of 3.6 mg/ml per well) to determine if
the effect of AGR2 could be neutralized. AGR2 specificity
of P3A5 was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of
AGR2 in AGR2-secreting prostate cancer cell culture
media, and its use in sandwich ELISA to measure urinary
AGR2 [12]. Bacterially made recombinant AGR2 was
not used because mammalian proteins in bacteria are
not folded correctly and lack proper post-translational
modifications. In addition, NP strom cells were irradiated
at 25 mjoule/cm2 in a Ultra-Violet Crosslinker (Cole
Palmer, Vernon Hills, IL) or treated with staurosporine
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 1 μM. Cells were photographed
and RNA was isolated from different time points. Cell
necrosis was induced by electroporation using an AMAXA
nucleoporator (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland).

Gene expression analyses
Differential gene expression analysis from array
datasets was described in our previous publications [3, 44].
The obtained array CEL files were loaded into GeneSpring
7.2 (Agilent Technologies), which used an analysis

algorithm of the open source Bioconductor project [45].
Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
was used to confirm the array result. Oligonucleotide
primers were SAT1-5 GACTGCAGTGACATACTGCGG
and SAT1-3 ACAGCAGCACTCCTCACTCCT; B2M-5
GGCTATCCAGCGTACTCCAAAGATTC and B2M3 GTCTCGATCCCACTTAACTATCTTGGGC. The
expected product size for SAT1 was 492 bp and that for
B2M 297 bp. The cycling parameters were 94°, 30 s; 57°,
30 s; 72°, 1 min for 35 cycles. The reaction products were
resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis.
