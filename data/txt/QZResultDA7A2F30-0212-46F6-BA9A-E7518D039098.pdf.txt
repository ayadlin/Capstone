Abstract
Our group and others have determined that immune effector cells from patients with advanced cancers
exhibit reduced activation of IFN signaling pathways. We hypothesized that increases in immune regulatory cells
termed myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) could interfere with the host immune response to tumors by
inhibiting immune cell responsiveness to IFNs. The C26 murine adenocarcinoma model was employed to study
immune function in advanced malignancy. C26-bearing mice had significantly elevated levels of GR1þCD11bþ
MDSC as compared with control mice, and splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice exhibited reduced phosphorylation of STAT1 (P-STAT1) on Tyr701 in response to IFN-a or IFN-g. This inhibition was seen in splenic CD4þ
and CD8þ T cells as well as natural killer cells. In vitro coculture experiments revealed that MDSC inhibited the
IFN responsiveness of splenocytes from normal mice. Treatment of C26-bearing mice with gemcitabine or an
anti-GR1 antibody led to depletion of MDSC and restored splenocyte IFN responsiveness. Spleens from C26bearing animals displayed elevated levels of iNOS protein and nitric oxide. In vitro treatment of splenocytes with
a nitric oxide donor led to a decreased STAT1 IFN response. The elevation in nitric oxide in C26-bearing mice
was associated with increased levels of nitration on STAT1. Finally, splenocytes from iNOS knockout mice
bearing C26 tumors exhibited a significantly elevated IFN response as compared with control C26 tumor-bearing
mice. These data suggest that nitric oxide produced by MDSC can lead to reduced IFN responsiveness in
immune cells. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5101–10. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Previous studies showed that the endogenous production of
IFN is essential for immunosurveillance against developing
tumors (1, 2). It has been determined that mice lacking either
the IFN-g receptor (IFN-gR1) or the major IFN signal transducer STAT1, developed tumors at a faster rate than wild-type
mice following exposure to the carcinogen 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA). In addition, mice lacking IFN-gR1 or STAT1 as
well as the tumor suppressor p53 developed a wider range of
spontaneous tumors as compared with wild-type mice lacking

p53 only (1). Studies by Dunn and colleagues have also shown
the distinct importance of IFN-a/b sensitivity in cells of the
hematopoietic lineage for immunoediting and antitumor
immunity in vivo (3). IFNs are now accepted as critical
mediators of immunosurveillance and are important in both
innate and adaptive antitumor immune responses. A functional immune system in patients with cancer is also critical
for the success of immune-based therapies, such as exogenously administered cytokines, vaccines, and targeted antibodies via the induction of type I IFNs (e.g., IFN-a, IFN-b) and
type II IFNs (IFN-g). Our group and others have determined
that immune effector cells from patients with advanced
cancers exhibit reduced activation of IFN-induced signaling
pathways (4, 5). One potential mechanism for the immune
inhibition seen in tumor-bearing hosts is the presence of
increased numbers of immune suppressor cells.
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are a heterogeneous population of early myeloid cells that accumulate in the
blood and tumors of patients with cancer. Their numbers
correlate with tumor burden (6). These cells arise from
myeloid precursors in response to tumor-derived growth
factors and proinflammatory cytokines (6, 7). MDSC are
described phenotypically in murine models as GR1þCD11bþ,
with subsets expressing IL-4Ra (7, 8). MDSC have been shown
to reside in the peripheral blood, lymphoid tissue, and tumor
tissue of mice in a number of experimental models (6, 9–13).

Mundy-Bosse et al.

Prior studies have shown that MDSC can inhibit the effector
function of natural killer (NK) and T cells in tumor-bearing
animals through multiple mechanisms, including the release
of immune-suppressive cytokines, the generation of nitric
oxide and reactive oxygen species, and the depletion of
arginine or cystine from the tumor microenvironment (6,
14, 15). Studies in murine models indicate that disruption
of MDSC function can reverse immune tolerance to tumor
antigens, stimulate antitumor immune responses, and markedly inhibit tumor growth (6, 7).
We hypothesized that elevated numbers of MDSC present
in the setting of advanced malignancy would inhibit the
response of immune cells to type I and type II IFNs. The
results of our experiments showed that mice bearing C26
adenocarcinoma tumors exhibit elevated numbers of MDSC
which led to increased nitration on STAT1 and impaired
responsiveness of immune effector cells to IFNs.

Methods
Cytokines and reagents
Recombinant murine IL-6 and IFN-g were purchased from
R&D Systems, Inc. Recombinant Universal Type I Interferon
(IFN-A/D) was purchased from PBL Biomedical Sciences. Snitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) was purchased from
Molecular Probes.
Murine tumor models
Male 4- to 6-week-old BALB/c  DBA/2F1 (CD2F1) mice
were used (Harlan). Colon 26 (C26) tumor cells (106 cells) were
injected subcutaneously into the flank of CD2F1 mice (16).
Male Balb/c By and iNOS knockout mice were injected with
C26 tumor cells (106 cells) for nitric oxide studies (4–6 weeks;
Jackson Labs). Female BALB/c mice (4–6 weeks; Harlan) were
injected in the mammary fat pad with 5  104 4T1 tumor cells.
Intracellular flow cytometry
Levels of P-STAT1 and STAT1 were measured via flow
cytometry in cells derived from murine splenocytes or lymph
nodes following in vitro stimulation with PBS, IFN-A/D, or
IFN-g as described previously (4). Data were expressed as
specific fluorescence (Fsp ¼ Ft  Fb), where Ft represents the
median value of total staining and Fb represents the median
value of background staining with an isotype control antibody
(4, 17, 18). CD4, CD8, and CD49b antibodies were used for
surface staining of immune subsets (BD Biosciences). For
nitration flow cytometry, splenocytes were colabeled with
anti–STAT1-PE and anti–nitrotyrosine-alexafluor-488 antibody (BD Biosciences and Millipore).
Real-time PCR
Following TRIzol extraction (Invitrogen) and RNeasy purification (Qiagen), total RNA was quantitated and reverse
transcribed as previously described (19). The resulting cDNA
was used to measure gene expression by real-time PCR by
using predesigned primer/probe sets and 2 TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix with 18s rRNA as an internal control
(Applied Biosystems).

Immunoblot analysis
Lysates were prepared from splenocytes following in vitro
stimulation with PBS or IFN-A/D and assayed for the expression of proteins by immunoblot (19). For the detection of
nitrated STAT1, samples were immunoprecipitated with
STAT1 (BD Biosciences) and then probed with an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody (Invitrogen).
Flow cytometric analysis of myeloid derived
suppressor cells
Analysis of the MDSC in splenocytes was conducted as
previously described (8). Briefly, 106 splenocytes were labeled
with fluorochrome-labeled antibody-targeting murine CD11b,
GR1, IL-4Ra, or appropriate isotype control antibody (BD
Biosciences) for 1 hour at 4 C, washed, resuspended in 1%
formalin, and analyzed via flow cytometry.
Immunofluorescent staining of MDSC
Tumors were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight,
dehydrated in sucrose, and embedded in ornithine carbamyl transferase (OCT) and frozen. Frozen sections (5 mm)
were probed with anti-GR1 alexafluor 488 (Invitrogen) and
anti-CD11b alexafluor 647 (BD Bioscience) antibodies, or
appropriate isotype control. Sections were also labeled
with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear stain.
Slides were analyzed on an Olympus FV1000 Spectral
Confocal microscope.
Isolation of MDSC from C26-bearing mice
Spleens were harvested aseptically from tumor-bearing
mice (18), filtered through 70 mmol/L cell strainers, washed
with PBS, and resuspended in media. GR1þCD11bþ MDSC
were isolated by using anti-GR1 biotinylated beads (Miltenyi
Biotec) with purity greater than 95% by flow cytometry.
Isolated MDSC were cocultured with splenocytes at a 1:3
ratio. This ratio recapitulates the number of MDSC present
within the spleen of a C26-bearing mouse. After 24 hours,
splenocytes were harvested from culture and stimulated with
IFN-A/D (104 U/mL) for 15 minutes. IFN-induced levels of
P‑STAT1 were measured by flow cytometry as described.
MDSC depletion with GR1 antibody
On day 20 post-tumor inoculation with C26, mice were
treated with either anti-GR1 (BD Biosciences) or isotype
control antibody (Sigma) at a concentration of 0.25 mg/mouse
in 200 mL PBS. MDSC depletion was verified in the spleen and
tumor by flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining of
frozen tumor sections
Gemcitabine treatment of C26-bearing mice
Two days after C26 tumor inoculation, mice received twice
weekly intraperitoneal injections of gemcitabine (Gemzar; Eli
Lilly) at a dose of 75 mg/g of body weight. This agent has been
previously validated as an effective means of reducing MDSC
(20–22). For 24 hour depletion studies, mice were injected
with 75 mg/g gemcitabine 24 hours prior to animal harvest.
MDSC depletion was also verified in the tumor by immunofluorescent staining of frozen tumor sections.

MDSC and IFN Response

Statistical analysis
Two-sample t tests were used to compare outcomes (e.g.,
IL-6, Ifit2, P-STAT1) between groups. If necessary, outcomes
were log transformed to meet the assumptions of normality
and constant variance for the test. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to quantify the relationship between outcomes. Tumor growth was assumed to be log linear and a
mixed effects model with a random intercept and slope for
each animal was used to estimate the rate of increase. P values
less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Decreased IFN response of immune cells from tumorbearing mice
We hypothesized that immune effector cells in tumorbearing mice would have an altered response to cytokines
that promote antitumor immunity as is seen in patients with
advanced malignancy. Of particular interest were the type I
and type II IFNs, as these cytokines mediate tumor immunosurveillance, and reductions in immune cell IFN responsiveness have been shown to exist in cancer patients (1–3, 24). The
C26 model was chosen for this study because of its rapid
tumor growth and ability to mimic advanced clinical disease.

Immunohistochemistry of tumors
Tumors were fixed in formalin, washed with PBS, paraffin
embedded, sectioned into 4-mm slices, attached to lysinecoated slides, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin as
previously described (23). Briefly, replicate sections were
deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5
minutes, followed by rinses in diH2O. Ag retrieval was
achieved in Dako's target retrieval solution (Dako S1699) by
heating slides at 94 C for 30 minutes and cooling at room
temperature for 15 minutes. Slides were then incubated for 60
minutes with antibodies specific for CD34 (Abcam; clone
MEC14.7), and Ki67 (Thermo; clone SP6). Detection was
achieved with the Vectastain Elite ABC system and Novared
Chromogen (Vector). All samples were examined in a blinded
fashion by an experienced pathologist (K.M. La Perle), using an
Olympus BX45 light microscope with an attached DP25 digital
camera (B & B Microscopes Limited). Automatic quantification was carried out on whole slide images scanned at 40

MDSC levels are elevated in tumor-bearing mice, and
are associated with decreased IFN response in vitro
Flow cytometric analysis showed a significantly higher
percentage of MDSC in splenocytes from C26-bearing mice
as compared with splenocytes from control animals (Fig. 3A
and B; ref. 25). Histologic analysis of splenic tissue revealed
extramedullary hematopoiesis and abundant myeloid precursors resulting in extensive splenomegaly (data not shown).
Time course studies revealed that an increase in MDSC
occurred as early as 7 days post-tumor inoculation (Supplementary Fig. S2A). To test whether MDSC can directly inhibit
IFN responsiveness of immune cells, a series of in vitro studies
was initiated in which GR1þCD11bþ MDSC were isolated from
splenocytes of C26-bearing mice and cocultured with immune

stimulation of splenocytes with IFN-A/D (104 U/mL) was
significantly reduced at day 22 in C26-bearing mice [mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) of P-STAT1 ¼ 18.8; range ¼ 4.0–
33.4] as compared with control mice (MFI of P-STAT1 ¼ 37.9;
range ¼ 27.0–50.0; Fig. 1A; P < 0.0001). Induction of
P-STAT1 was also significantly decreased in splenocytes from
C26-bearing mice following stimulation with 10 ng/mL IFN-g
(Fig. 1B; P ¼ 0.003). MDSC (approximately 15%–20% of total
splenocytes) were excluded from this analysis by gating to
ensure that the lymphocyte populations of normal and tumorbearing animals were of comparable composition. These
results were validated by immunoblot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The decrease in IFN responsiveness was also
observed in cells derived from lymph nodes (Supplementary
Fig. S1C). To evaluate the effect of the C26 tumor on IFN on
responsiveness in vivo, normal or C26 tumor-bearing animals
were injected with IFN-A/D (2  104 U) and splenocytes were
harvested 2 hours later for analysis. The level of P-STAT1 was
evaluated by intracellular flow cytometry as described previously (Fig. 1C). As expected, the P-STAT1 response was
reduced in mice bearing C26 tumor both at baseline and in
response to exogenous administration of IFN. An analysis of
IFN responsiveness in lymphocyte subsets by dual parameter
intracellular flow cytometry revealed that the induction of PSTAT1 was inhibited in CD4, CD8, and CD49b (NK cells;
Fig. 1D; CD4, P ¼ 0.009; CD8, P ¼ 0.002; NK, P ¼ 0.02). We
next analyzed the induction of the IFN-a-stimulated gene
interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2
(IFIT2) and the IFN-g-stimulated gene IFN regulatory factor 1
(IRF1) by quantitative real-time PCR following a 4 hour in vitro
treatment of splenocytes from C26 bearing or normal mice
with either IFN-A/D (102 U/mL or 104 U/mL) or IFN-g (10 ng/
mL). The expression of Ifit2 was significantly reduced in
splenocytes obtained from C26-bearing mice as compared
with controls (n ¼ 5 mice per group) at both doses of IFN-A/D
(normal ¼ 92.7  24.5 vs. C26 36.4  12.6, P ¼ 0.0018 at 102 U/
mL; normal ¼ 202.2  21.7 vs. C26 99.9  17.2, P ¼ 0.0059 at
104 U/mL; Fig. 2A). The expression of Irf1 was also significantly
reduced in splenocytes from C26-bearing mice (n ¼ 5–6 mice
per group) versus controls following a 4-hour stimulation with
IFN-g (Fig. 2B; P < 0.05). We also evaluated expression of the
IFN-inducible genes ISG15, OAS1, and IRF8 and observed
similar trends (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B; data not shown).

normal mice and cocultured with MDSC had a reduced level
of IFN-stimulated P-STAT1 as compared with normal splenocytes cultured for the same time period (Fig. 3C; MFI of
P-STAT1 ¼ 22.87 vs. 33.61; P ¼ 0.0004). P-STAT1 was measured
in the lymphocyte population only, excluding MDSC from
analysis by gating. We also showed that elevated MDSC levels
were associated with concomitant decreases in IFN responsiveness in the 4T1 murine epithelial cancer model (Supplementary Fig. S2B) which supported the association of MDSC
with reduced generation of P-STAT1 in response to IFN-a.
Reduction of MDSC leads to restored IFN
responsiveness in C26-bearing mice
C26-bearing animals were treated with the drug gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog, which has been previously
employed by other groups to deplete MDSC (20–22, 26). This
treatment regimen led to a decrease in the percentage of
MDSC present within splenic tissues (Fig. 4A; 10.1% vs. 3.7%;

gemcitabine 24 hours prior to spleen harvest, and saw comparable levels of MDSC depletion in splenocytes from C26
tumor-bearing animals. As predicted, long-term gemcitabine
treatment reduced tumor growth by approximately 90%,
whereas the 24-hour treatment resulted in no change in tumor
volume. Splenocytes obtained from C26-bearing mice treated
both for long term and for 24 hours with gemcitabine exhibited a restoration of IFN responsiveness as measured by
intracellular P-STAT1 flow cytometry and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S4). Notably, when we
evaluated the effects of gemcitabine directly on C26 tumor
cells in vitro, only 15% of C26 cells were apoptotic when using
an equivalent dose of gemcitabine (data not shown). C26bearing animals were also treated with an anti-GR1 antibody
24 hours prior to spleen harvest (day 20 post-tumor inoculation). This short-term depletion strategy was utilized to evaluate the direct effects of MDSC on IFN response in the presence
of fully developed tumors. The reduction in MDSC levels (77%
decrease) was verified by flow cytometry (Fig. 4C). Splenocytes
from tumor-bearing mice treated with one dose of anti-GR1
exhibited a significantly higher IFN response compared with
the splenocytes of tumor-bearing mice treated with isotype
control as evaluated by intracellular P-STAT1 flow cytometry
and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4D, 42% increase in MFI of PSTAT1 at 104 U/mL P ¼ 0.002; Supplementary Fig. S4).
GR1þCD11bþ MDSC were also evaluated in the tumor after
treatment with gemcitabine or anti-GR1. All treatments led to a
reduction in intra-tumor MDSC as compared with tumorbearing control animals (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Elevated nitric oxide and IFN responsiveness
We hypothesized that soluble factors produced from the
abundant MDSC present in the splenic tissue could contribute
to the reduced IFN response in tumor-bearing mice. We
evaluated two of the major mechanisms through which MDSC
are known to exert their suppressive effects, and discovered
that while arginase I transcript levels were not significantly
different in tumor-bearing splenocytes as compared with
splenocytes from normal mice, iNOS mRNA levels were dramatically elevated (data not shown; Supplementary Fig. S3C).
DAF-FM and iNOS staining and fluorescent microscopic
analysis were employed to test whether decreased IFN responsiveness might be associated with increased levels of nitric
oxide in the splenic tissue. These data confirmed a dramatic
increase in the level of iNOS protein and nitric oxide in
splenocytes from C26-bearing mice as compared with spleens
from control animals (Fig. 5A). Pretreatment of splenocytes
from normal mice with the nitric oxide donor SNAP (Molecular Probes) led to a decreased phosphorylation of STAT1 in
response to IFN-a stimulation (Fig. 5B; MFI of P-STAT1 ¼ 35.7
vs. 16.4). STAT1 was immunoprecipitated from equal numbers
of splenocytes from normal and C26 tumor-bearing mice and
probed with an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody to detect nitration
of STAT1 protein. We carried out a Student's t test analysis on
the densitometry results and determined that the ratio of
nitrated STAT1 to total STAT1 in tumor-bearing mice is
statistically higher than that in normal mice, showing that
C26-bearing animals exhibited significantly elevated nitration

In this report, we have shown that immune cells from tumorbearing mice display a significantly reduced capacity for IFNinduced signal transduction and gene induction via the STAT1
pathway. This inhibitory effect was observed in CD8þ and
CD4þ T cells, as well as in NK cells and occurred following both
in vivo and ex vivo IFN stimulation. C26 tumor-bearing mice
exhibited enlarged spleens as compared with normal controls
and displayed a concomitant increase in the level of
GR1þCD11bþ MDSC, and depletion of MDSC in tumor-bearing
mice led to a restoration of IFN responsiveness in immune
cells. Consistent with these observations, in vitro coculture of
splenocytes with MDSC reduced their ability to respond to
IFNs. Splenocytes from C26-bearing mice had elevated levels of
iNOS protein, nitric oxide production, and STAT1 tyrosine

addition, we validated the level of nitrated tyrosine on STAT1
by flow cytometry. Splenocytes from normal and C26 tumorbearing mice were labeled with antibodies against total STAT1
and nitrotyrosine. Splenocytes from tumor-bearing and normal mice had equal levels of total STAT1. There was significantly more nitrated STAT1 in splenocytes from tumorbearing animals as compared with splenoctyes from normal
mice (36  2.0% vs. 17  0.3%; P < 0.001; Supplementary
Fig. S3D). This result provides direct evidence that nitration
on STAT1 was enhanced in C26-bearing mice. These data
support a role for nitric oxide in dampening the response of
immune effector cells to stimulation with IFN in tumorbearing animals. To determine the role of nitric oxide in
IFN responsiveness in vivo, iNOS knockout mice were inoculated with C26 tumor cells and tumors were allowed to grow
for 21 days. At the end of the study, tumor sizes were
comparable between iNOS knockout mice and wild-type
control mice bearing C26 tumors. Splenocytes from iNOS
knockout mice exhibited a significantly elevated induction
of P-STAT1 in response to IFN stimulation as compared with
immune cells from wild-type mice (IFN 104 U/mL, P ¼ 0.01;

reactive nitrogen species, which leads to reduced IFN-induced
signal transduction in immune cells.
Our group and others have determined that immune cells
from patients with advanced cancers exhibit reduced activation of IFN-induced signaling pathways, although the
mechanisms underlying this observation are still under
investigation. We utilized the C26 model to recapitulate
the complex interactions that take place between immune
cells and cancer cells in vivo. The IFN response of lymphocytes from C26 tumor-bearing mice (as measured by STAT1
phosphorylation and regulation of IFN-stimulated genes)
was significantly reduced when compared with normal mice.
It was also noted that the spleens of these mice were
enlarged and filled with myeloid precursor cells. Phenotypic
characterization revealed that these precursor cells were
MDSC, and we hypothesized that they were responsible for
the reduced activation of STAT1 in response to IFN-a.
Previous work by Mazzoni and colleagues showed that
coculture of immortalized murine MDSC with T cells in
an in vitro nontumor model led to an inhibition of the T-cell
response to IL-2 (27). We subsequently showed that the
presence of primary MDSC in tumor-bearing animals was
associated with altered IFN signal transduction and that
removal of this cell population led to restoration of IFN
responsiveness. Thus, MDSC seem to be an important
regulator of the downstream response to IFNs in tumorbearing mice. This is the first report in which MDSC have
been implicated as a mechanism for the reduced activation
of immune cells following IFN stimulation.

Mundy-Bosse et al.

Although other tumor or MDSC-derived factors may contribute to reduced IFN responsiveness, our data suggest that
the production of nitric oxide by MDSC is a major mechanism
in this model. Increased levels of iNOS and nitric oxide in the
spleen lead to the nitration of STAT1 on immune cells, which is
the proposed mechanism of inhibition of IFN signaling. Importantly, splenocytes from iNOS-deficient tumor-bearing mice
had a significantly improved IFN response as compared with
splenocytes from wild-type tumor-bearing mice. This finding
provides a direct in vivo link between excess nitric oxide and
decreased IFN responsiveness in the setting of malignancy. In
support of these observations, Brito and colleagues (28) have
shown that peroxynitrite treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells led to increased nitration of tyrosine residues,
which inhibited transcription factor phosphorylation following
CD3 stimulation, whereas Llovera and colleagues (29) showed
that LPS-treated macrophages had an impaired in vitro
immune cell response to IFN-g due to an increase in nitric
oxide in the culture. We observed that tumor-bearing mice
exhibited elevated splenic levels of iNOS protein and treatment
of normal splenocytes with SNAP, a nitric oxide donor, suppressed the P-STAT1 response of the splenocytes to IFN-a
stimulation. Nitration on STAT1 in primary lymphocytes from
tumor-bearing mice has not been shown previously in an in
vivo murine model. These findings support a role for nitric
oxide in the inhibition of IFN signal transduction.
In the studies with iNOS-deficient mice, IFN responsiveness
in splenocytes from tumor-bearing animals was not fully
restored to levels observed in normal animals. This indicates
that other mechanisms may exert an effect on the IFN
response in the tumor microenvironment. We evaluated
alternative mechanisms that could lead to this inhibition,
such as increased levels of arginase I or IL-6. Upregulation
of arginase I has been identified as a mechanism of immune
suppression that is employed by MDSC (30–32). Although
previous studies in macrophages have shown an inverse
relationship between iNOS and arginase I levels, it has been
shown that in a tumor setting it is possible for iNOS and
arginase I to be coexpressed (8, 20, 33, 34). However, splenic
levels of this enzyme were not significantly elevated in the C26
model. Although arginase could still play a role in the tumor
environment, our data in iNOS-deficient mice suggest that
iNOS is a driving factor for the decreased IFN response in
immune cells in this model. Despite the observation that
immune cells from iNOS-deficient mice exhibited improved
responsiveness to IFN, it is important to note that C26 tumors
from these knockout mice were similar in size to those from
control mice. We anticipated that enhancement of the
immune cell IFN response might lead to improved growth
control of tumor cells in iNOS-deficient mice and reduced
overall tumor volume. However, there was no significant
reduction in external tumor size at the end of the study. It
is important to note that in this model, the nitric oxide
deficiency was present in all host tissues, rather than just
the MDSC compartment, and nitric oxide has effects on
multiple biologic processes (tumor cell invasion/proliferation,
and angiogenesis). A careful quantitative histologic analysis of
tumors revealed significantly decreased levels of Ki67 (pro-

liferative marker) and CD34 (expressed on vascular endothelium) in iNOS-deficient mice as compared with those from
wild-type mice (Fig. 6). These findings indicate that the iNOS
deficiency resulted in biological differences at the site of the
tumor. Additional studies would be needed to directly assess
the long-term impact of improved IFN response and iNOSdeficiency on survival and antitumor immunity.
The presence of tumor can also induce elevations in
proinflammatory cytokines that have been associated with
MDSC generation or function. In the C26 model, IL-6 levels
were elevated in tumor-bearing mice as compared with
normal mice. However, in vitro treatment of splenocytes
with IL-6 did not alter the P-STAT1 response to IFN-a and
administration of exogenous IL-6 was similarly incapable of
inhibiting the splenocyte response to this cytokine (Supplementary Fig. S6). Another potential explanation for our
results relates to possible changes in levels of Jak-STAT
signaling intermediates. However, a careful analysis revealed
no significant difference in the protein expression of STAT1,
IFN-AR, or Jak1 in splenocytes obtained from tumor-bearing
mice as compared with normal control mice (data not
shown). As seen in Figure 5C, there was some variability
in total STAT1 protein between individual mice, but this
variability was not associated with the presence or absence
of tumor. Previous work by Brito and colleagues showed that
increased nitric oxide did not lead to changes in total STAT1
levels in immune cells, and this was confirmed in the present
model when it was shown that STAT1 protein levels were
similar in splenocytes from normal and tumor-bearing mice
despite high levels of nitric oxide (28).
The observation of decreased IFN responsiveness in
immune cells has important implications for the clinical
course of disease in cancer patients. Type I and II IFNs play
a critical role in mediating the response to immune-based
therapies (24). Therefore, conditions that inhibit IFN-induced
signal transduction and gene transcription are likely to dampen the responsiveness of the host immune system to
immune-based treatments and the host's ability to recognize
and eliminate established tumors (35–39). Reports have also
shown that type I and II IFNs are functionally important in
mediating tumor immunosurveillance against MCA-induced
sarcomas and the progression of tumors in p53 null mice (1, 2).
Previous studies from our group and others have shown that
lymphocytes from patients with metastatic melanoma and
other solid malignancies have an inherent reduction in basal
and/or IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation as compared
with normal donors (4, 5, 40). It is important to note that
these studies focused on the IFN response in T cells and NK
cells, but did not evaluate the responsiveness of dendritic cells
or other cell subsets that have been previously shown to play a
role in IFN mediated antitumor immunity. These subsets
could potentially be impaired by nitrated residues as was
observed in other lymphocyte populations. Reduced immune
surveillance resulting from nitric oxide–dependent inactivation may therefore be important in the process of tumorigenesis and/or tumor progression.
To our knowledge this is the first in vivo report to show that
elevated numbers of MDSC are associated with a decreased

cellular response to IFN stimulation in the setting of cancer.
Further experiments suggest that increased nitration of
STAT1 on tyrosine residues is responsible for the diminished
IFN response in splenocytes. Therefore, therapeutic strategies
targeted at reducing MDSC or upstream factors could potentially serve to restore IFN responsiveness in tumor-bearing
hosts.
