BACKGROUND: Patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) respond to ALK inhibitors. Clinically, the presence of 15% cells with rearrangements identified on break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) classifies tumors as positive. Increases in native and rearranged ALK copy number also occur. METHODS: In total, 1426 NSCLC clinical
specimens (174 ALK-positive specimens and 1252 ALK-negative specimens) and 24 ALK-negative NSCLC cell lines were investigated.
ALK copy number and genomic status were assessed by FISH. RESULTS: Clinical specimens with 0% to 9%, 10% to 15%, 16% to 30%,
31% to 50%, and >50% ALK-positive cells were identified in 79.3%, 8.5%, 1.4%, 2.7%, and 8.1%, respectively. An increased native ALK
copy number (3 copies per cell in 40% of cells) was detected in 19% of ALK-positive tumors and in 62% of ALK-negative tumors.
In ALK-negative tumors, abundant, focal amplification of native ALK was rare (0.8%). Other atypical patterns occurred in approximately 6% of tumors. The mean native ALK copy number ranged from 2.1 to 6.9 copies in cell lines and was not correlated with crizotinib sensitivity (50% inhibitory concentration, 0.34-2.8 lM; r 5 0.279; P 5.1764). Neither native or rearranged ALK copy number nor
the percentage of positive cells correlated with extra-central nervous system progression-free survival in ALK-positive patients who
were receiving crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 8.5% of tumors fell below the established positivity threshold by 5%. Further
investigation of ALK by other diagnostic techniques in such cases may be warranted. Native ALK copy number increases alone were
not associated with sensitivity to ALK inhibition in vitro. However, rare, complex patterns of increased native ALK in patients should
be studied further; because, otherwise, atypical rearrangements contained within these may be missed. Cancer 2013;119:3968-75.

INTRODUCTION
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements represent the primary oncogenic driver in a subset of lymphomas
and solid tumors.1 In all of these rearrangements, the promoter and a region encoding a 50 dimerization motif from
another gene is fused to the region encoding the 30 kinase domain of ALK, leading to constitutively active expression of
ALK within the resulting fusion protein. In ALK-rearranged (ALK-positive) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the
most common 50 fusion partner is echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4), although other, less common 50 partners have also been described.1
ALK-positive NSCLC treated with crizotinib, a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity against ALK as
well as ROS1 and MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor), is associated with a high response rate and prolonged
progression-free survival (PFS).2-4 Within the initial and ongoing crizotinib clinical trials in NSCLC, ALK status was
determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the Vysis break-apart probe set (Abbott Molecular, Des
Plaines, Ill), which is the only companion diagnostic for crizotinib licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) to date.5,6 The break-apart FISH testing involves DNA probes binding 50 (green-labeled) and 30 (orange-labeled,
usually appearing as red in most microscope settings) of the common fusion breakpoint in ALK. When a rearrangement
occurs, either a split or single red signal is noted in a cell (Fig. 1). Only a single rearranged signal is required to call a cell

positive; however, not every cell in an ALK-positive tumor
will reveal a detectable rearrangement by FISH, presumably in part because of false cellular negatives.5,7 Moreover, a proportion of cells even in normal tissues can
appear to have a rearrangement by FISH because of presumed false cellular positives.5 The ALK FISH assay was
original developed for the detection of ALK rearrangements in lymphomas, which are associated with a range of
different 50 fusion partners, primarily reflecting chromosomal translocations.8 Conversely, EML4, the most common fusion partner in NSCLC, resides on the same
chromosome 2p arm as ALK, and the rearrangement is
caused by a paracentric inversion. Consequently, lymphomas are associated with subtly different cytogenetic patterns of positivity than those observed in NSCLC. When
the break-apart FISH assay was first modified for use in
NSCLC, a natural gap in the continuum of the percentage
of ALK-positive cells in lung tumors was identified
that appeared to reliably distinguish between those
assumed to be true-positive tumors and those in which it
was assumed that the low positive cell counts reflected
only the background noise of the assay.5 In the initial
studies of crizotinib in NSCLC, >15% of tumor cells
were required to indicate a rearrangement and to classify a
tumor as ALK-positive.2,5,7 Later, with the approval of

the assay as a companion diagnostic by the FDA, 15%
of tumor cells was adopted as the accepted cutoff point.6
In addition to the break-apart FISH assay, several other
ALK diagnostic techniques also have been developed,
including the use of immunohistochemistry (IHC) to
search for the aberrant re-expression of the ALK protein
and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis to search for the presence of the abnormal fusion transcripts.6 Case reports have been published of tumors that
were designated as ALK-negative by FISH but were determined to be ALK-positive using these other techniques
that responded to ALK inhibitors, raising the possibility
that the established FISH assay may miss an unquantified
proportion of true-positive cases.9-11 Because of the rarity
of ALK-positive NSCLC, the identification of the FISH
cutoff point to reliably distinguish true-positive tumors
from true-negative tumors was inevitably based on a relatively small initial data set.5 With far more NSCLC specimens currently tested by ALK FISH, there is now the
potential to more accurately re-explore whether the
threshold value chosen still defines a true gap in the continuum of the assay and whether it should remain the sole
determinant of ALK positivity in NSCLC.
In addition to the percentage of cells manifesting
rearrangements, the break-apart FISH assay also provides

information on the copy number per cell in both the
native and rearranged ALK genes. The later development
of rearranged ALK copy number gain (CNG) compared
with baseline precrizotinib levels is one of several different
identified mechanisms of acquired resistance to crizotinib.12,13 Yet, increases in copy number of both rearranged
and native ALK relative to the diploid state in inhibitornaive specimens also occur.5,14 In vitro, increases in the
copy number of native ALK in NSCLC cell lines have
been associated with crizotinib sensitivity in the 1 to 3 lM
range.15 However, the clinical significance of baseline
native=rearranged ALK copy number to crizotinib sensitivity at physiologic exposures remains unclear.16
We previously demonstrated that neither the positive cell count, the baseline native copy number, nor the
baseline rearranged copy number had any significant association with the maximal percentage shrinkage according
to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) (version 1.0) in ALK-positive tumors treated
with crizotinib.7 However, not all of the clinical benefit
from a drug may manifest as tumor shrinkage, and correlations between the different cytogenetic features of ALK
positivity (cell count or copy number of native or rearranged signals) and PFS endpoints have not been reported
previously in ALK FISH-positive tumors treated with
crizotinib.
In this report, we explore whether the rearrangement
of 15% of tumor cells reflects a clear biologic distinction
in the frequency of ALK-positive cells in more than 1400
tested NSCLC tumors. We also explore the details of variation in native ALK copy number in tumors with and
without ALK rearrangements, the significance of baseline
native and rearranged copy number on PFS outcomes for
treatment with crizotinib in ALK-positive patients, and
the significance of native copy number on crizotinib outcomes in ALK-negative cell lines at 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) compatible with clinically achievable
exposures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical Specimens

Clinical NSCLC specimens that were tested for ALK
between October 2008 and December 2010 at the Colorado Molecular Correlates (CMOCO) laboratory were
identified and investigated. ALK copy number and
genomic status (rearranged=native) were assessed using
Vysis break-apart FISH, as previously described.5,7
Because of an institutional review board-approved protocol at the University of Colorado, we were permitted to
3970

correlate clinical data on patients who had molecular analyses conducted at the CMOCO laboratory.
Clinical Response and Progression-Free Survival
Data

A subset of the tested patients received treatment at the
University of Colorado and had clinical data on crizotinib
outcomes available (n 5 33). Patients received crizotinib
treatment both within reported clinical studies and as
standard of care after US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) licensing.3,4,17 The best objective responses of target lesions according to RECIST version 1.0 were assessed
in patients who had measurable disease after crizotinib
treatment. Radiographic disease assessments were performed at baseline before patients commenced treatment
with the inhibitor and continued after every other 21-day
or 28-day cycle (depending on the clinical trial involved
or physician preference if patients were treated off-study).
PFS was calculated from the first dose of the crizotinib
until the patient had either documented radiographic or
clinical progression according to RECIST or a change in
systemic therapy (other than discontinuation). Extra-central nervous system (eCNS) PFS was then calculated
excluding CNS-only events. We used eCNS PFS as the
primary PFS variable in the analyses because of the high
CNS failure rate with crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC,
which may represent low drug exposure more than biologic evolution.4,18,19
In Vitro Cell Line Sensitivity Data

Twenty-four ALK and ROS1 rearrangement-negative cell
lines (A459, Calu-3, H1975, H2009, H2122, H322C,
H3255, H358, HCC2279, HCC4006, HCC4011,
HCC44, PC9, H125, H1703, H1299, H1334, H460,
H661, H157, H226, H520, HCC95, and NE18) were
analyzed by ALK FISH, and the mean copy number of the
native ALK gene per cell was determined. Two ALK
rearrangement-positive cell lines (H2228 and H3122)
were used as positive controls. The IC50 of crizotinib was
determined for each cell line using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide
(MTT)
growth assay. Briefly, 1000 to 2000 viable cells were plated
into 100 lL of growth medium in 96-well plates (Corning, Ithaca, NY) and incubated overnight at 37 C. Crizotinib 0 to 10 lM was added, and the plates were incubated
for 5 days; then, tetrazolium salt was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mg=mL to each well. The medium was
aspirated after 4 hours, and the reduced MTT product was
solubilized by adding 100 lL of 0.2 N HCl in 75% isopropanol and 23% Milli-Qwater (Millipore Corporation,

Billerica, Mass) to each well. Thorough mixing was done
using a Finnpipette (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
Mass). The absorbency of each well was measured at 490
nm using an automated plate reader (Molecular Devices,
Sunnyvale, Calif).
Statistical Analyses

The difference between ALK-negative and ALK-positive
cases in mean native ALK copy number was analyzed
using a 2-sample t test. The frequency of native ALK copy
number gain between ALK-negative and ALK-positive
cases was analyzed using the Fisher exact test. Correlation
between mean native ALK copy number and crizotinib
sensitivity was analyzed using Spearman correlation. In
the survival analysis with eCNS PFS as the outcome,
native and rearranged ALK copy number and the percentage positive cell count were categorized with their respective quartiles; Cox proportional hazards regression
was then used to analyze these associations. All statistical
analyses were performed using SAS=STAT software version 9.3 of the SAS System for Windows (SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
In total, 1426 NSCLC clinical specimens that were tested
for ALK rearrangements within the CMOCO laboratory
(174 ALK-positive specimens and 1252 ALK-negative
specimens according to standard criteria) were identified.
In ALK-positive, crizotinib-treated patients, eCNS PFS
data were available on 33 patients.
Clinical specimens with 0% to 9%, 10% to 15%,
16% to 30%, 31% to 50%, and >50% ALK-positive cells
were observed in 79.3%, 8.5%, 1.4%, 2.7%, and 8.1% of
NSCLC cases, respectively (Fig. 2). The proportions,
in detail, among the ALK-negative cases are listed in
Table 1.
The mean native ALK copy number per cell was significantly higher in the ALK-negative group than in the
ALK-positive group (mean 6 standard deviation [SD],
2.8 6 0.93 copies per cell [range 1.2-11.4 copies per cell]
vs 1.8 6 0.79 copies per cell [range, 0.6-5.3 copies per
cell]; P < .0001) (Fig. 3). The frequency of native ALK
copy number gain (defined as 3 copies per cell in 40%
of cells) was significantly higher in ALK-negative tumors
(62%) than in ALK-positive tumors (19%; P < .0001).

Figure 3. The mean copy number of native anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) was significantly higher in patients with
ALK-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) than in
those with ALK-positive NSCLC. SD indicates standard
deviation.

In ALK-negative tumors, although the native ALK
copy number was elevated, the distribution of signals
within the nucleus was largely diffuse, suggesting the
occurrence of polysomy of chromosome 2 or partial polysomy of 2p23 (Fig. 4A). Abundant, focal amplification of
native ALK was rare (0.8%) (Fig. 4B), whereas scanty
amplification (<10% of tumor cells) occurred in 1.1% of
tumors, and duplication of the entire native ALK or of the
30 ALK end occurred in 3.5% (2.9% and 0.6%, respectively) (Fig. 4C,D). Single green signals (extra copies of
the 50 ALK with loss of 30 ALK) were observed in 1.2% of
these specimens.
Among ALK-negative lung cancer cell lines, the
mean native ALK copy number per cell ranged from
2.1 to 6.9 and was not correlated with in vitro crizotinib
sensitivity (IC50, 0.34-2.8 lM; r 5 0.279; P 5 .1764)
3972

(Fig. 5A). In a 2-sided, unpaired t test, we determined
that the IC50 for crizotinib was no different for cells that
had native ALK copy number gain (3 copies per cell of
native ALK in 40% of cells) compared with all other cell
lines, defined as those with balanced or loss of native ALK
copy number (P 5 .21) (Fig. 5B).
In ALK-positive patients who received treatment with
crizotinib, neither native ALK copy number (P 5 .2859),
nor rearranged ALK copy number (P 5 .4115), nor the percentage of positive cells (P 5 .0748) correlated with eCNS
PFS on crizotinib.
DISCUSSION
Screening patients who have advanced NSCLC for an
ALK rearrangement is now considered part of standard
care based on the dramatic and prolonged objective
responses observed when these patients are directed toward an ALK inhibitor like crizotinib.2,4,17 Consequently,
accurately identifying the patients who will derive most
benefit from these inhibitors is imperative. Here, we
describe our exploration of several different aspects of the
ALK FISH break-apart assay, which is the only ALK diagnostic assay that is currently FDA approved.
Initial data suggested that a cutoff point of 15% or
>15% of cells exhibiting an ALK rearrangement by
break-apart FISH for classifying a tumor as ALK-positive
would generate few borderline cases. For example, our
own series had previously suggested that cell counts in
positive tumors began at 22% and, in negative tumors=normal tissue, stopped at 11%.5 Specifically, the 15%
cutoff point used in the initial crizotinib studies and the
>15% cutoff point adopted by the FDA appeared to develop in a naturally occurring gap in the continuum of the
assay. However, after analyzing a much larger series, we
now perceive that considerable proportions of “negative”
cases closely approach the established cutoff points (Fig.
2, Table 1). Overall, 8.5% of cases occur in the 10% to
15% range (9.7% of ALK-negative tumors). Although
15% would be considered positive in some studies and
negative in others, the number of tumors with exactly
15% was very low; therefore, the overall conclusion is not
changed depending on whether 15% or >15% is chosen
as the criterion for positivity. Consequently, a second
ALK diagnostic technique (eg, IHC) is recommended for
such borderline cases to more accurately identify the true
genomic status of ALK.6
Because FISH analyses can also offer information
about the copy number of both the native and rearranged
ALK gene, several studies have already explored the importance of ALK copy number with regard to outcomes

with crizotinib. It is known that baseline increases in copy
number of both rearranged and native ALK relative to the
diploid state occur, and associations between native copy
number and sensitivity to high levels (1-3 lM) of crizotinib have previously been reported in vitro.5,14,15 In our
current analyses, we did confirm the frequent increase in
native ALK copy number reported by others. It is interesting to note that the native ALK mean copy number was
significantly higher in ALK-negative specimens than in
ALK-positive specimens (mean 6 SD: 2.8 6 0.93 copies
per cell [range, 1.2-11.4 copies per cell] vs 1.8 6 0.79 copies per cell [range, 0.6 to 5.2 copies per cell]; P < .01)
(Fig. 3). An increased native ALK copy number (3 copies per cell in 40% of cells) was detected in 19% of
ALK-positive tumors and in 62% of ALK-negative
tumors (P < .001). The lower native ALK copy number in
Cancer

ALK-positive NSCLC suggests that ALK rearrangement
occurs early in tumorigenesis, preceding chromosomal
instability, consistent with our previous studies.7 Because
ALK positivity primarily occurs in individuals who have
little or no smoking history, it is perhaps not surprising
that these data suggest that ALK-positive lung cancer may
reflect a “near-diploid” or genetically “simple” cancer.5,7
We previously demonstrated no relation between either native=rearranged copy number or the percentage of
cells positive for a rearrangement with the maximal tumor
shrinkage according to RECIST observed in ALKpositive patients who were receiving crizotinib.7 Because
not all clinical benefit may be manifest through the methods for determining tumor shrinkage used by RECIST,
we attempted to correlate these same parameters with lack
of tumor progression as assessed through the eCNS PFS

of ALK-positive patients who received crizotinib. However, again, we were unable to demonstrate any significant
correlation between eCNS PFS and either the native or
rearranged copy number or the percentage of cells positive
for a rearrangement in the tumor by FISH. With regard
to rearranged signals, we previously demonstrated a strong
correlation between the copy number of the rearranged
gene and the percentage of cells counted as positive in the
tumor, consistent with differences in cell counts in positive tumors largely reflecting missed positive cells and not
true biologic negatives.7 Consequently, beyond the importance of the cell count in determining whether a tumor is
positive or not in the first place, it is perhaps not surprising
that PFS has no more correlation with these variables than
tumor response. With regard to native copy number, additional discussion is required. Unlike the previous in vitro
data obtained in experiments conducted at supraphysiologic exposures, our own data suggest no association
between native copy number and sensitivity to crizotinib
3974

in ALK-negative cell lines treated at lower exposures that
were more comparable to those used when studying ALKpositive cell lines (Fig. 5).12,15,16
When investigating the pattern of native copy number gain in ALK-negative patients, there is little suggestion
of specific selection of this region of the genome by the
cancers. Abundant, focal amplification of native ALK was
rare in ALK-negative tumors (0.8%); scanty amplification
(<10% tumor cells) occurred in only 1.1%, and most
CNG occurred without significant amplification. However, duplication of the entire native ALK or of the 30 and
50 ALK occurred in 3.5% of ALK-negative tumors. Instead
of simply reflecting the overall aneusomy of the cancer,
such patterns may represent direct or inverse duplications
or more complex rearrangements specifically involving
the region of interest. In all such cases, it may be possible
that the rearrangement still leads to the fusion of ALK
with an activating partner. For example, Lipson et al
described the in-frame fusion C2orf44:ALK in colorectal
cancer, resulting from a 5-Mb tandem duplication at
2p23; and Peled et al reported an EML4:ALK fusion
detected by next-generation sequencing and IHC in a
specimen that exhibited a FISH pattern that was negative
by standard criteria but that had complex, atypical features.9,20 Consequently, whereas native ALK copy number alone does not appear to be a useful predictor of ALK
inhibitor sensitivity, the possibility that complex or atypical rearrangements that exist within the rare cases of focal
native ALK duplication or amplification has to be
considered.
Extra copies of 50 ALK with loss of 30 ALK are not
expected to represent activation of the ALK gene by
fusion, because the 50 ALK signal represents exons 1 to 19
and does not include the tyrosine kinase domain. However, there are reports of NSCLC with extra copies of 50
ALK and loss of 30 ALK (appearing as single green signals
with the break-apart FISH probes) in which it was determined that the tumors carried the EML4-ALK fusion.11 A
possible explanation is that those tumors also have complex rearrangements in the 2p23-21 region, and the
genomic region left in the area encompassed by the 30 ALK
probe only covers the ALK tyrosine kinase domain and is
too small to be visually detectable in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. Therefore, like the borderlinenegative tumors according to the percentage cell count,
“atypical” negatives (ie, tumors that do not meet the current break-apart positivity criteria but have evidence of
potential complex rearrangements within the ALK locus,
such as 30 ALK doublets or single 50 ALK) also should be
considered for additional interrogation with a second ALK

diagnostic technique. By capturing clinical outcomes from
atypical negative and borderline negative FISH cases in
which the second diagnostic suggests the true presence of
an activating rearrangement, it should be possible to minimize missed therapeutic opportunities among the true
inhibitor-sensitive, ALK-positive population.
