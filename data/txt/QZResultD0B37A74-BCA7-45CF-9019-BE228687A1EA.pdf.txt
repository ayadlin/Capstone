ABSTRACT
Combination therapy with decitabine, a DNMTi and carboplatin resensitized
chemoresistant ovarian cancer (OC) to platinum inducing promising clinical activity.
We investigated gene-expression profiles in tumor biopsies to identify decitabinereactivated pathways associated with clinical response. Gene-expression profiling was
performed using RNA from paired tumor biopsies before and 8 days after decitabine
from 17 patients with platinum resistant OC. Bioinformatic analysis included
unsupervised hierarchical-clustering, pathway and GSEA distinguishing profiles
of “responders” (progression-free survival, PFS>6months) and “non-responders”
(PFS<6months). Functional validation of selected results was performed in OC cells/
tumors. Pre-treatment tumors from responders expressed genes associated with
enhanced glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, translational misregulation, decreased
ABC transporter expression, TGF-β signaling, and numerous metabolic pathways.
Analysis of post-treatment biopsies from responders revealed overexpression of
genes associated with reduced Hedgehog pathway signaling, reduced DNA repair/
replication, and cancer-associated metabolism. GO and GSEA analyses revealed
upregulation of genes associated with glycosaminoglycan binding, cell-matrix
adhesion, and cell-substrate adhesion. Computational findings were substantiated by
experimental validation of expression of key genes involved in two critical pathways
affected by decitabine (TGF-β and Hh). Gene-expression profiling identified specific
pathways altered by decitabine and associated with platinum-resensitization and
clinical benefit in OC. Our data could influence patient stratification for future studies
using epigenetic therapies.

INTRODUCTION

OC resensitization to platinum resulting in clinical benefit.

Development of chemotherapy resistance is the
predominant cause of treatment failure and death in highgrade serous ovarian cancer (OC). The majority of women
with OC respond well to initial platinum-based therapy
[1], however, over 80% eventually develop platinum
resistance, which is uniformly fatal [2]. Therapeutic
options are limited for patients with platinum resistant
OC and new agents including anti-angiogenics, PARP
inhibitors, folate targeted therapies and others are currently
under clinical investigation [1]. “Personalized medicine”
aiming to tailor therapy to the molecular characteristics
of individual tumors has not yet materialized in improved
outcomes [3]. While several second-line therapeutic
approaches have prolonged progression-free survival
(PFS), the impact on overall survival remains modest [4].
Platinum resistance in OC is believed to be
multifactorial, resulting from transmembrane drug
efflux, impairment of DNA mismatch repair, apoptosis,
and senescence-promoting pathways, and/or gain of
base-excision repair, growth-promoting, and metabolic
pathways [5]. Epigenetic anomalies, including aberrant
DNA methylation, histone modifications and nucleosome
remodeling, are considered hallmarks of all stages of
cancer development and have been consistently described
in OC [6]. Specifically, altered DNA methylation patterns,
such as increased DNA methylation within CG-rich
(“CpG islands”) promoter regions (often within tumor
suppressor genes), are a well-studied transcriptionally
repressive epigenetic modification widely reported
in OC [7, 8]. Recently it has been demonstrated that
the “deep silencing” epigenetic mark can be reversed
using pharmacological approaches, such as by DNA
methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTIs). We [9, 10]
and others [11] previously demonstrated in preclinical
studies that decitabine, a DNMTI approved for clinical
use, resensitizes chemoresistant OC cells to platinum.
We further translated these observations into a phase I/
II clinical trial which showed that low-dose decitabine,
administered for five consecutive days (qd x 5) followed
by carboplatin, resulted in promising clinical activity.
Specifically we reported that the regimen induced an
objective response rate of 35% in platinum-resistant OC
patients [12, 13]. Additionally, 9 of 17 treated patients
(53%) were free of disease progression at 6 months.
To determine the effects of the DNMTI on gene
expression, we analyzed tumor material obtained
either by biopsy or by collection of cell pellets from
malignant ascites obtained before (baseline) and after 5
days of decitabine treatment. Integrated bioinformatics
analyses correlated decitabine-induced alterations in gene
expression and DNA methylation with clinical benefit
(PFS > 6 versus < 6 months). Specifically, we sought to
identify epigenetically regulated signaling pathways and
biological processes associated with decitabine-mediated

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identifies
“predictive” profiles and specific genes in pretreatment (“baseline”) samples
We recently reported the results of a phase I/II trial
using low-dose decitabine therapy to resensitize platinumresistant ovarian tumors to carboplatin [12]. Specifically,
the regimen consisted of five consecutive-day, one-hour
infusions of 10 mg/m2 decitabine (days 1 – 5), followed
by carboplatin (AUC 5) on day 8 of a 28-day cycle [12,
13]. Out of 17 enrolled patients, nine were free of disease
progression at six months. Moreover response correlated
with in vivo decitabine bioactivity, as measured by
hypomethylation of specific genes/loci (“methylomic”
alterations induced by decitabine) [14-16].
We analyzed gene expression profiles in tumor
biopsies and cell pellets from malignant ascites predecitabine treatment. As shown in Figure 1A, a significant
difference in pretreatment gene expression patterns was
observed between “responders” (PFS > 6 months) and
“non-responders” (PFS < 6 months).
Focusing on specific genes identified by GSEA
that were enriched in pretreatment tumor biopsies, we
noted upregulation of numerous cancer/testes antigen
genes (G antigen 12B - GAGE12B, X antigen family
member 5 - XAGE5, synovial sarcoma X breakpoint 10
- SSX10, and several melanoma antigen (MAGE) family
members, encoding tumor-specific cell surface antigens
(Supplemental Table S1)) in eventual responders [17].

Decitabine-induced alterations in gene expression
patterns/pathways
To identify specific decitabine-associated alterations
of genes/pathways previously associated with OC, we
performed bioinformatics analyses to compare changes
in gene set expression pre- (day 1) and post- (day
8) decitabine administration in responders and nonresponders, respectively. Hierarchical clustering showed
differential gene expression in responders (Figure 1B) and
non-responders (Supplemental Figure S1). As shown in
Table 1, we identified in tumor biopsies from responding
patients, decitabine-associated upregulation of antagonists
of both TGF-β (chordin - CHRD, inhibin β A - INHBA,)
and Hh (incontinentia pigmenti1 - IP1, patched 2 PTCH2) pathways [18, 19]. In addition, downregulation
of the TGF-β agonists E1A binding protein 300 (EP300),
retinoblastoma-like 1 (RBL1I), and SMAD specific E3
ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (SMURF1) [19, 20], occurring

simultaneously with downregulation of gene members
of the cell cycle and DNA replication were observed in
tumors from responders. These observations suggest that
inactivation of the TGF-β pathway by treatment with a
DNMTI can be predictive of clinical response.
In all patients’ biopsies, decitabine treatment
markedly (P<0.01) altered methylation of CATG1B
cancer/testis antigen 1B (NY-ESO-1) (Supplemental Figure
S2), a target antigen for immunotherapy [21], suggesting
a dual role of decitabine as an epigenetic modulator and
possible immunosensitizer. Although a vaccine target in
OC, limited NY-ESO-1 expression represents a barrier to
vaccine efficacy, and decitabine-mediated upregulation of
NY-ESO-1 has the potential to augment this therapeutic
approach [22]. Another well-known gene family found to
be overexpressed in non-responders prior to decitabine
was tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases
(TIMP) class (Supplemental Table S1). Elevated TIMP1
expression level was also associated with drug resistance
in breast cancer [23].
Similar to the GSEA pathway analyses described
above, we determined which specific Gene Ontology (GO)
terms were enriched in responders and non-responders

based on the decitabine-altered gene expression patterns
(Supplemental Figures S3 and S4, respectively). In
responders, we found enrichment of upregulated GO
terms related to glycosaminoglycan binding (in contrast
to decitabine downregulation of glycan degradation, Table
1) and other extracellular matrix-protein interactions
(purple arrowhead), while enriched downregulated GO
terms again included numerous processes related to
DNA replication fidelity, cell cycle checkpoints, and
mitotic progression (yellow arrowhead) and binding of
the oncoprotein nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)
(Supplemental Figure S3).
In non-responders, enrichment of GO terms
associated with physiological homeostasis was observed,
including endocytosis, transcription and gene expression
fidelity (Supplemental Figure S4, gray arrowhead).
Downregulated GO terms, by contrast, included various
responses related to DNA integrity and its influence on
cell cycle progression (thus suggesting attenuated cellular
detriment by DNA damage and extracellular matrix
(ECM) interactions/cell motility (Supplemental Figure S4,
cyan and purple arrowheads, respectively), in similarity to
our KEGG-pathway determinations (Supplemental Table
S3). Thus, these processes might be expected to be related
to normal cell homeostasis (endocytosis, transcription,
etc.), and those associated with the stemness- and
drug resistance-associated epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition, thus further contributing to drug resistance [24].

pyrosequencing and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR).
Genes were selected based on previous reports suggesting
that these genes are regulated by DNA methylation and are
linked to responsiveness to chemotherapy. For instance,
hypomethylation corresponding to transcriptional
upregulation of the Wnt signaling antagonist AXIN1 [25,
26] has been reported to contribute to chemoresistance
in OC. The embryonic developmentally regulated gene
homeobox A11 (HOXA11) has been shown to play a direct
role in platinum resistance and HOXA11 methylation
correlated with suboptimal tumor debulking and OC poor
prognosis [27]. The role of the DNA mismatch repair
enzyme mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) in platinum response
in OC has been widely reported [6, 28, 29]. Targeted
validation of methylation and gene expression for these
transcripts (Supplemental Figure S5).
We also performed qRT-PCR to validate selected
genes from Table 1 and supplemental Table S3 in RNAs
from patient biopsies and from OC cell lines treated with
decitabine. Genes were selected based on involvement in
pathways altered by decitabine induced hypomethylation
and known clinical relevance to OC progression. First, we

tested bone morphogenetic protein 5 (BMP5), winglesstype MMTV integration site family member 5B (WNT5B),
inhibin beta A (INHBA), chordin (CHRD), ATP-binding
cassette sub-family B member 1 (ABCB1), ST3 betagalactoside alpha-2,3sialytransferase 3 (ST3GAL3) and
extracellular matrix protein 2 (ECM2) in patient biopsies.
Consistent with the microarray results, BMP5, WNT5B
INHBA, CHRD and ABCB1 were upregulated in posttreatment samples from responders and downregulated in
non-responders. ST3GAL3 and ECM2 were upregulated in
non-responders (Figure 2A).
Having first taken a bioinformatics approach to
identify the TGF-β pathway as responsive to epigenetic
interventions, we subsequently used qRT-PCR to measure
mRNA expression levels of CHRD and INHBA, two
TGF-β pathway antagonists, in OC cell lines treated
with decitabine (A2780, A2780 C1R5, SKOV3, CP70,
and C272; Figure 2B). Decitabine treatment upregulated
CHRD and INHBA expression levels in the majority of cell
lines examined (5μM decitabine upregulated both genes
in C1R5, CP70, SKOV3, and C272, 100nM decitabine
upregulated both genes in A2780, CP70, and SKOV3),

supporting that the TGF-β pathway is responsive to
treatment with DNMTIs.
To demonstrate that the TGF-β pathway is
functionally relevant to platinum resistance, we used
the TGF-β receptor I antagonist LY-364947. LY-364947
prevented TGF-β induced activation of p-Smad2 (Figure
3A) in these cells. Pre-treatment with the TGF-β receptor
inhibitor resensitized SKOV3 and C272 OC cells to
cisplatin (Figure 3B), supporting that abnormal activation
of the pathway is associated with platinum resistance.
These results suggest that decitabine may resensitize
ovarian tumors to cisplatin partly by upregulating the
expression of antagonists in the TGF-β pathway.

Supplemental Figure S6B, these genes continued to remain
upregulated in all non-responsive patients examined,
following decitabine treatment (day 8), as compared to
pre-treatment (day 1). Collectively, the findings from
this small study may represent a potential panel of genes
for further investigation as prognostic biomarkers of
hypomethylating strategies in OC.

DISCUSSION
Previously, we thoroughly assessed alterations in
global DNA methylation in rapport to clinical outcomes
in a phase II clinical trial of decitabine and carboplatin
for patients with advanced-stage, recurrent and platinumresistant OC [12, 13]. In the current work, in silico
bioinformatics analyses integrate transcriptomic and
methylomic data from tumor biopsies obtained before and
after treatment. Our results delineate candidate signaling
pathways and biological processes associated with clinical
outcomes (PFS>6 months vs. <6months) in this trial. To
our knowledge, this represents the first study assessing
gene expression in human solid tumors exposed to a
hypomethylating agent and the first attempt to identify
profiles predictive of clinical benefit. Our analyses
demonstrate highly divergent patterns of gene expression
in responders vs. non-responders, both at baseline (pretreatment) and following decitabine administration. We
also describe alterations in specific pathways/biological
processes induced by decitabine in tumor samples in
association with clinical response in a small study.
Specifically, we found that pre-treatment
(“baseline”) expression of several members of the
cancer/testis antigen and TIMP gene families were
predictive of response (Supplemental Table S1). TIMP3
expression was previously associated with metastasis
and poor survival in OC [34], while re-expression of the
embryonically expressed, but subsequently repressed
cancer antigens may be associated with an immune
response caused by decitabine [22]. This is particularly
intriguing as decitabine elicited higher than expected
rates of platinum hypersensitivity reactions in this
clinical trial [13], consistent with an immune-mediated
effect. These observations highlight the possibility that
the anti-tumor effect of the combination treatment may
result from heightened immune reaction activated by the
hypomethylating strategy.
In tumor samples obtained following decitabine
therapy, up-regulation of Hh antagonists, in concert
with downregulation of gene members involved in
nonhomologous end joining, cell cycle, and numerous
metabolic pathways (Table 1) was associated with clinical
outcome. These findings provide a rationale for future
testing of decitabine and Hh antagonists combinations in
OC models [35]. The data are also consistent with data
from our recent study demonstrating that Hh pathway is a
key signaling pathway regulated by DNA methylation in

Integration of decitabine-induced changes in DNA
methylation and gene expression
To integrate “methylome” and “genome” changes,
we correlated gene expression and DNA methylation
alterations by using the Partek Genome Suite. In
responsive patients (PFS>6 months), hypomethylation
of 311 genes was observed (Figure 4A), with 11 genes
demonstrating concurrent upregulation (Figures 4A, 4B).
Of specific interest was the putative tumor suppressor
PTCH2 [30], an antagonist of the Hh pathway, a pathway
our previous comprehensive analysis of methylation
profiles found to be of particular importance to poor
OC survival [31]. Hh pathway activity plays a key
growth-promoting role in various malignancies [32].
PTCH1 and PTCH2, coding two homologous Ptch
receptors, have been shown to interact with Hh ligands
and regulate signaling through the Hh pathway [33].
Our results showing that PTCH2 can be demethylated
and its expression upregulated by decitabine (also see
Supplemental Table S1) suggest for the first time a role for
PTCH2 in epigenetic chemoresensitization in OC patients.
Additional genes found to be concurrently DNAhypomethylated and upregulated (Figure 4B) included
those belonging to the solute carrier (SLC) family,
encoding transporters involved in drug uptake/efflux
and attenuated isoosmolarity (solute carrier family 14
member 2 - SLC14A2 and solute carrier family 12 member
1 - SLC 12A1), chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6), unc-5
homolog C-like (UNC5CLII; also known as ZUD), prolyl
4-hydroxylase, alpha polypeptide III (P4HA3), poly(A)
binding protein cytoplasmic 5 (PABPC5), and insulin
receptor substrate 4 (IRS4). The potential implications of
these observations are discussed below.
While 11 genes were hypomethylated and
upregulated in responders (Supplemental Figure S6A),
only two such genes were identified in non-responders,
IQ motif containing F2 (IQCF2) and EF-hand calcium
binding domain 3 (EFCAB3) (Figures 4A, Supplemental
Table S4). Neither of them has been reported to be
associated with cancer or drug resistance. As shown in

OC and that loss of negative Hh signaling feedback may
contribute to disease progression [31].
Likewise, in post-decitabine biopsies of responders,
downregulation of TGF-β signaling was observed,
a finding we substantiated in cell-based assays. We
demonstrated that inhibition of TGF-β signaling by using a
receptor kinase inhibitor resensitized OC cells to platinum;
suggesting that inactivation of the pathway by decitabine
in our trial could have contributed to the observed clinical
response to carboplatin. The findings are in agreement
with our and others’ results implicating TGF-β pathway
in ovarian tumor progression [36, 37]. We have also
previously reported that abrogated responses to TGF-β in
OC cells are associated with epigenetically mediated gene
silencing [38].
Interestingly, we observed the involvement of a
less reported, OC-associated epigenetic phenomenon, i.e.,
glycan metabolism and protein/lipid glycosylation patterns
[39], noting increased biosynthesis/decreased degradation
associated with baseline and post-treatment response
(Table 1), and decreased synthesis linked to nonresponse
(Supplemental Table S3). These results concur with
other reports that glycosylation patterns can significantly
affect tumor-suppressive vs. tumor-promoting effects
of glycoproteins [40], and that N- and O-glycans may
facilitate tumor migration and metastasis [40].
The integrated analysis seen in Figure 4 revealed
a potential role for several decitabine-derepressed genes
(hypomethylated and upregulated) such as SLC14A2 and
SLC 12A1 encoding transporters involved in drug uptake/
efflux and attenuated isoosmolarity [41], CCR6, which has
been correlated with favorable prognosis in lung cancer
patients [42], and UNC5CLII, an inhibitor of NF-kappaB
activation that sensitized 293 cells to apoptosis [43]. In
addition, methylation-dependent silencing of P4HA3
in B-cell lymphoma cell lines was previously shown to
be reversible by DNMTI treatment [44], and PABPC5
has been associated with premature ovarian failure [45]
but a role for either gene in OC has not been previously
reported. Finally, although enhanced cell proliferation
and Wnt/β-catenin signaling by IRS1/2 was reported
[46], IRS4-mediated suppression of IRS1 and IRS2 has
been shown [47, 48], suggesting that decitabine-mediated
reactivation of IRS4 could play an inhibitory role in OC
cell proliferation.
The current results concur with our previous report
describing genomic changes associated with acquired
platinum resistance in an OC cell line rendered resistant
by exposure to incremental increases in cisplatin, over
five cell generations [10]. In that model we also observed
that numerous GO terms encompassing mitotic pathways,
DNA repair, oxidative phosphorylation-related processes,
and macromolecule biosynthesis being upregulated
in platinum-resistant OC cells [10]. Analogously, that
system revealed downregulated apoptotic processes and
protein kinase inhibition in the resistant cells similar to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the pathways enriched in non-responsive tumors[10].
Taken together, the mechanistic results linked to this small
phase I/II study are consistent with long-held hypotheses
regarding the origin of OC platinum resistance [5, 25,
49], including inhibition of drug efflux, alteration of prosurvival (i.e., anti-apoptosis) pathways, upregulation of
Hh antagonists and downregulation of DNA repair/cell
cycle progression signaling.
In summary, this study provides strong clinical and
biological evidence supporting further investigation of
hypomethylating strategies in platinum-resistant OC. We
identified numerous pathways linked to chemotherapy
response whose baseline activity levels also associate
with clinical outcome. These data suggest that not one
pathway, but rather complex networks involved in drug
sensitivity/resistance mechanisms require “epigenetic
reprogramming” to successfully resensitize insensitive
tumors to platinum. We show that this can be achieved in
vivo by using decitabine, a global DNA hypomethylating
agent, in combination with chemotherapy. Our results,
although based on a small cohort of patients, provide
convincing rationale for future testing of combinations
regimens including decitabine with other targeted
therapeutics (e.g. immune stimulators or TGF-β and Hh
inhibitors).

As described in our previous reports [12, 13],
eligibility for patient enrollment in the phase II trial
included a diagnosis of OC or primary peritoneal
carcinomatosis (PPC) and disease progression or
recurrance within six months after platinum-based
chemotherapy. 28-day treatment cycles consisted of
10 mg/m2 intravenous (iv) decitabine (Eisai, Tokyo,
Japan), daily (qd) for five consecutive days, followed by
iv carboplatin (Bristol Meyers Squibb, Princeton, NJ)
administered on day 8 at an area under the curve (AUC)
of 5 [12, 13]. Tumor tissue or malignant ascites were
obtained through core biopsies or paracentesis under
radiographic guidance on days 1 (pre-decitabine) and 8
(post-decitabine, pre-carboplatin) during cycle 1, from
enrolled patients, as previously described [12]. Objective
response was the primary objective and was measured
by RECIST1.0 criteria, while duration of PFS was a
secondary endpoint [12].

[10, 50]. The immortalized cell line C272 /hTert/E7 was
cultured in growth medium containing 1:1 MCDB 105
(Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC., St. Louis, MO) and M199
(Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Cellgro) and 1% antibiotics, as described previously [36].

Drug treatments
To validate the re-expressed genes in cell lines by
epigenetic agent, in vitro drug treatment and qRT-PCR
were performed. Briefly, 48 hours after 105 cells of each
OC cell line seeded in the 10cm-dish, different doses of
decitabine (100nM for 72 hours or 5μM for 48 hours) was
added to the culture. Following drug treatments, RNA
was isolated for qPCR validation, which was described
previously [10].

Pathway/biological process data analysis
Partek Genomic Suite (PGS; St. Louis, MO) was
used for unsupervised hierarchical clustering of total gene
expression and all pathway and gene set analyses, linked
to the databases KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes, www.genome.jp/kegg/) and GSEA (Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis, www.broad.mit.edu/GSEA) [16]. In
addition, PGS was used to determine DNA methylation
and gene expression statistical correlations.

Cell proliferation and immunoblotting assays
MTT assay was performed to evaluate platinum
resensitization by TGF-β pathway inhibitor. Detailed
experiment procedures were described previously [9,
10]. Briefly, SKOV3 and C272cells were pre-treated
for 24-48 hours with 10μM LY-364947 before 3 hour
incubation with cisplatin. Cells were lysed in icecold Radio-Immunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) buffer
containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail,
EDTA-free (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL USA). After
sonication and centrifugation, equal amounts of proteins
were separated by SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting,
the PVDF membranes were incubated with primary and
HRP–conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive
proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence
solution (Thermo Scientific). Images were captured by
a luminescent image analyzer with a CCD camera (LAS
3000, Fuji Film) and quantified by densitometric analysis
using Gel-Pro Analyzer 3.1 software.
All the results of in vitro studies are reported as

Experimental validation of gene expression and
methylation
Validation of the microarray results in tumor
samples and cell lines was performed by isolation of
total RNA (described above), reverse transcription by
MMLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI),
and quantitative PCR, using the 2−ΔΔCT method of relative
quantification, as we have previously described [9, 10]
(expression normalization to the housekeeping gene
EF1α). Primer sequences are provided in Supplemental
Table S2. Pyrosequencing was used to validate gene
methylation (EpigenDX, Hopkinton, MA).
