ABSTRACT
Liver cancer is the second-most frequent cause of cancer death in the world and
is highly treatment resistant. We reported previously that inhibition of neddylation
pathway with specific NAE inhibitor MLN4924, suppressed the malignant phenotypes
of liver cancer. However, during the process, MLN4924 induces pro-survival autophagy
as a mechanism of drug resistance. Here, we report that blockage of autophagy with
clinically-available autophagy inhibitors (e.g. chloroquine) significantly enhanced the
efficacy of MLN4924 on liver cancer cells by triggering apoptosis. Mechanistically,
chloroquine enhanced MLN4924-induced up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins
(e.g. NOXA) and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. Importantly, the
down-regulation of NOXA expression via siRNA silencing substantially attenuated
apoptosis of liver cancer cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that blockage of
autophagy augmented MLN4924-induced DNA damage and reactive oxygen species
(ROS) generation. The elimination of DNA damage or blockage of ROS production
significantly reduced the expression of NOXA, and thereby attenuated apoptosis and
reduced growth inhibition of liver cancer cells. Moreover, blockage of autophagy
enhanced the efficacy of MLN4924 in an orthotopic model of human liver cancer, with
induction of NOXA and apoptosis in tumor tissues. These findings provide important
preclinical evidence for clinical investigation of synergistic inhibition of neddylation
and autophagy in liver cancer.

RESULTS

To test the hypothesis, two classical autophagy inhibitors
CQ and BafA1, which block the late steps of autophagic
flux by inhibiting the fusion of autophagosomes with
lysosomes and subsequent lysosomal protein degradation
[30, 31], were administrated in combination with
MLN4924 (MLN4924+CQ or MLN4924+BafA1). As
shown in Figure 1A, MLN4924 treatment alone or in
combination with CQ or BafA1 specifically inhibited
cullin1 (CUL1) neddylation, demonstrating the inactivation
of neddylation pathway with these treatments. To determine
whether CQ or BafA1 blocks the MLN4924-induced
autophagic flux, we first measured the expression of LC3II, a classical marker of autophagy [30, 31]. Our previous
study demonstrated that LC3-II is constantly induced by
MLN4924 over time, and it should be further accumulated
if its degradation by lysosomes at the late stage of
autophagic flux is blocked by CQ and BafA1 [30, 31]. As
shown in Figure 1A, the expression of LC3-II was elevated
upon MLN4924 treatment due to the induction of the
autophagic response and its level was further significantly
elevated upon CQ/BafA1 co-treatment with MLN4924
(Figure 1A), indicating that CQ or BafA1 potently blocked
the late steps of autophagic flux induced by MLN4924.
Furthermore, using the acridine orange staining
assay for autophagy detection, we found that MLN4924
induced intense red acridine orange fluorescence,
indicating the formation of acidic vesicular organelles
(AVOs), a classical marker of autophagy [30, 31] in
treated cells. In contrast, when MLN4924 was combined
with either CQ or BafA1, a color shift of acridine orange
fluorescence from bright red to a green/dim red was
observed, further indicating the inhibition of MLN4924induced formation of AVOs in cells (Figure 1B).
After establishing the efficacy of MLN4924 on the
specific inhibition of cullin neddylation and the efficacy
of CQ/BafA1 on the blockage of autophagy signaling,
we then determined whether blockage of the autophagic
response sensitized liver cancer cells to MLN4924. To
test this, cell viability and clonogenic cell survival were
evaluated with MLN4924+CQ and MLN4924+BafA1
treatment compared to MLN4924 treatment alone. We
found that inhibition of the autophagic response with either
CQ or BafA1 significantly enhanced MLN4924-induced
inhibition of cell viability (Figure 1C) and clonogenic cell
survival (Figure 1D) in both HepG2 and Huh7 cells. These
results demonstrated that blockage of the autophagic
response significantly enhanced the efficacy of MLN4924
on liver cancer cells (P < 0.01).

Autophagy inhibitors enhance MLN4924 efficacy
on liver cancer cell proliferation

Blockage of the autophagy response enhances
MLN4924-induced apoptosis

Since MLN4924 treatment induces pro-survival
autophagy in cancer cells [20, 29], we reasoned that
blockage of this protective autophagic response would
enhance the effect of MLN4924 on liver cancer growth.

We next investigated the underlying mechanisms
of enhanced MLN4924 efficacy on liver cancer cells
with autophagy blockage. In comparison with MLN4924
alone, MLN4924+CQ or MLN4924+BafA1 treatment

years, limited progress has been made in the targeted
therapy of liver cancer [7]. Therefore, further exploration
and validation of novel molecular targets of liver cancer
are still urgently required.
Post-translational protein neddylation is a
process that adds the ubiquitin-like molecule NEDD8
to substrates and thus regulates their conformation,
stability, localization and function [8–10]. This process is
catalyzed by a cascade comprising the NEDD8-activating
enzyme E1 (NAE), NEDD8-conjugating enzyme E2, and
substrate-specific NEDD8-E3 ligases [8–10]. The best
characterized substrates of neddylation are cullin-family
proteins, which are scaffolds of multi-unit Cullin-RING
E3 ligase (CRL) complexes [8–10]. NEDD8 conjugation
to cullins induces conformational changes and activation
of CRL to regulate the turnover of diverse specific CRL
substrates with fundamental roles in carcinogenesis and
tumor progression. The inactivation of CRL, through
inhibiting cullin neddylation, suppresses the growth of
cancer cells [11–14]. Up-regulation of NEDD8-catalyzing
enzymes (E1/E2/E3) and/or global protein neddylation
in human cancer further highlights the important role of
neddylation in cancer [15–19].
Targeting the neddylation pathway to inactivate
CRL E3 ligases has been shown to be an attractive
anticancer strategy, best evidenced by the efficacy of
the NAE inhibitor MLN4924 in preclinical studies
[11–14]. Due to its potent anti-cancer efficacy and
well-tolerated toxicity, MLN4924 has been evaluated
in multiple Phase I clinical trials for solid tumors and
hematologic malignancies [20–22]. The inactivation of
neddylation by MLN4924, either as a single agent, or
combined with chemoradiotherapy [23–26], triggers
multiple cellular responses involving DNA damage stress
[27, 28], cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and/or senescence
[25–28] to suppress the growth of cancer cells. However,
the protective autophagic response as a pro-survival
signal and a mechanism of drug resistance is induced by
MLN4924 via modulation of the Deptor-mTOR axis in a
broad panel of human cancer cells [20, 29].
In the present report, we hypothesize that inhibition
of pro-survival autophagy may augment the efficacy of
MLN4924 on liver cancer. As detailed below, we found
that autophagy-inhibiting agents sensitized liver cancer
cells to MLN4924 both in vitro and in vivo by inducing
NOXA-dependent apoptosis.

significantly increased the Annexin V-positive cell
population (Figure 2A), suggesting an amplification of
MLN4924-trigered apoptosis in HepG2 and Huh7 cells.
Moreover, blockage of autophagy enhanced caspase-3
activity, another indicator of apoptotic induction
(Figure 2B). Consistent with the results described above,
we found that the expression of cleaved PARP and
cleaved caspase 3 were substantially up-regulated upon
MLN4924+CQ or MLN4924+BafA1 treatment when
compared to MLN4924 alone (Figure 2C).
Besides, previous studies showed that G2
phase cell cycle arrest triggered by MLN4924 also

leads to suppression of liver cancer cells [20]. In this
study, we found that the elevation of cell cycle arrest
triggered by MLN4924+CQ is modest in HepG2 and
Huh7 cells compared with MLN4924 treatment alone
(Suppl. Figure 1A). Moreover, the expression of p21
and p27, two well-known CRL substrates and cell cycle
check-point inhibitors which are accumulated upon
treatments, appears to be no significant difference between
MLN4924 and MLN4924+CQ (Suppl. Figure 1B). These
results indicate that cell cycle arrest is not a main action
enhancing MLN4924-induced efficacy after blockage of
the autophagy response. Taken together, these findings

indicated that blockage of the autophagic response
improved the efficacy of MLN4924 mainly by enhancing
apoptosis of liver cancer cells.
To further validate the findings described above,
the autophagy pathway was genetically inactivated by
silencing of ATG7, an essential gene for autophagy
induction [32]. As shown in Suppl. Figure 2, downregulation of ATG7 expression (Suppl. Figure 2A)
effectively inhibited MLN4924-induced formation of
AVOs in both HepG2 and Huh7 cells (Suppl. Figure 2B),
indicating the effective inhibition of the autophagy
response by ATG7 knockdown. As a result, silencing of
ATG7 significantly increased the Annexin V-positive cell
population and the activity of caspase-3 (Suppl. Figure 2C)
in MLN4924-treated cells. These results demonstrated
that blockage of autophagy via either pharmacological
treatment or genetic manipulation enhanced the efficacy
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of MLN4924 by triggering elevated apoptosis of liver
cancer cells.

Blockage of autophagy induces a coordinated
dysregulation of pro-apoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins
To define how autophagy blockage amplified
MLN4924-induced apoptosis, CQ, an autophagy
inhibitor, was used for the further mechanistic
investigation. We  first systematically analyzed the
expression of a panel of classical pro-apoptotic and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins upon treatment of both
HepG2 and Huh7 cells, since the balance between proapoptotic proteins and anti-apoptotic proteins is crucial
for determining the fate of cells. In comparison with
MLN4924 alone, MLN4924+CQ treatment induced

significant up-regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins
including Puma, Bik and NOXA (Figure 2D) and downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins including c-IAP1/2,
Bcl-2, XIAP and Mcl-1 (Figure 2D) in both cell lines.
Quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (Q-PCR) analysis
for the expression of approximately 80 apoptosisregulatory genes using a human apoptosis PCR array
consistently demonstrated that MLN4924+CQ induced an
increase in mRNA expression of NOXA, Bik and Puma
compared to MLN4924 or CQ alone (Figure 2E and Suppl.
Table 3). Among the up-regulated pro-apoptotic proteins,
NOXA underwent the most significant increase at both

protein and mRNA levels (Figures 2D and 2E), suggesting
a more critical role of NOXA in the induction of apoptosis.

Silencing of NOXA significantly attenuates
MLN4924+CQ apoptotic induction and
liver-cancer-cell proliferation inhibition
Next we defined the potential role of NOXA in
MLN4924+CQ-induced apoptosis by down-regulating
NOXA expression via siRNA silencing. As shown in
Figure 3, the down-regulation of NOXA significantly
reduced Annexin V-positive (Figure 3A) and caspase-3

both for 72 hours. Apoptosis induction was quantified by Annexin V-FITC/PI double-staining analysis (A) or caspase 3 activity analysis by
FACS (B). (C) Knockdown efficiency and the expression of cleaved PARP were assessed by immunoblotting.

positive (Figure 3B) cell populations as well as the
expression of cleaved PAPR induced by MLN4924+CQ
treatment (Figure 3C), indicating a causal role of NOXA
expression in MLN4924+CQ triggered apoptosis in
liver cancer cells. Moreover, knockdown of NOXA
also substantially attenuated the inhibitory effect of
MLN4924+CQ on cell viability (Figure 3D). We
observed that siNOXA failed to down-regulate NOXA
to the basal level due to the potent induction of NOXA
by MLN4924+CQ treatment (Figure 3C), which
may underestimate the role of NOXA in MLN4924+
CQ-induced apoptosis. In contrast, silencing of Bik or
Puma, which also accumulated upon MLN4924+CQ
treatment (Figure 2D), failed to abrogate the suppressive
effect of MLN4924+CQ on cell viability in liver cancer
cells (Suppl. Figure 3), excluding a major role of Bik and
Puma expression in MLN4924+CQ-augmented apoptosis
and growth suppression. These findings indicated that
MLN4924+CQ-induced apoptosis was partially dependent
on the induction of NOXA.

Enhanced DNA damage contributes to
MLN4924+CQ-induced NOXA expression
and apoptosis of liver cancer cells
NOXA can be induced by DNA damage stress
[33, 34] and MLN4924 triggers DNA damage by stabilizing
DNA-replication licensing proteins CDT1 and ORC1 as
well-identified CRL substrates [27, 28, 35]. Therefore,
we proposed that NOXA induction, upon MLN4924+CQ
treatment, could be partially attributed to enhanced DNA
damage due to CDT1 and ORC1 accumulation. To test this
hypothesis, γH2AX, a surrogate marker of DNA double
strand breaks, was first analyzed by immunofluorescence
staining upon treatment. MLN4924+CQ significantly
enhanced the formation of γH2AX foci, compared to

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MLN4924 or CQ alone, in both HepG2 and Huh7 cells
(Figure 4A). The induction of γH2AX was significantly
enhanced by MLN4924+CQ when compared to MLN4924
treatment alone as observed by immunoblotting analysis
(Figure 4B). To assess the potential role of DNA damage
in the induction of NOXA and apoptosis, CDT1 and
ORC1 were simultaneously down-regulated by siRNA to
block DNA damage upon MLN4924+CQ treatment. As
expected, knockdown of CDT1 and ORC1 significantly
reduced the expression of γH2AX (Figure 4C), indicating
the attenuation of DNA damage by MLN4924+CQ
treatment. As a result, the expression of NOXA, cleavedcaspase 3 (Figure 4C), the percentage of AnnexinV-positive (Figure 4D) and caspase-3 active cells
(Figure 4E) were significantly reduced when DNA damage
stress was abrogated by MLN4924+CQ. These results
implied that DNA damage, triggered by CDT1 and ORC1
accumulation, partially contributed to NOXA induction and
apoptosis by MLN4924+CQ treatment.

The production of excessive ROS contributes to
MLN4924+CQ-induced NOXA expression and
apoptosis in liver cancer cells
NOXA-dependent apoptosis can be partially,
but not completely abrogated, by the blockage of DNA
damage (Figure 4). To further elucidate the underlying
mechanisms of MLN4924+CQ-induced NOXA
expression, we investigated the potential role of ROS
in NOXA expression, since ROS production during
cellular stresses could trigger NOXA expression [36, 37]
and MLN4924 induced elevation of ROS generation
[20]. We first assessed the impact of drug treatment
on mitochondrial transmembrane potential since the
impaired mitochondrial electron transport chain serves
as a major source of ROS production [26]. As shown in

Suppl. Figure 4, treatment of cells with MLN4924+CQ
caused significantly enhancement of mitochondrial
depolarization when compared to MLN4924 or CQ
treatment alone (Suppl. Figure 4). Next, ROS production
was monitored with the cell permeable ROS indicator,
2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2-DCFDA),
using flow-cytometry analysis [26]. MLN4924 or CQ
alone increased the level of ROS while MLN4924+CQ
significantly amplified the production of ROS compared
to treatment alone (Figure 5A left panel). Moreover, the
enhanced production of ROS induced by MLN4924+CQ
was completely blocked by pre-treatment of cells with
NAC, a classical ROS scavenger [36, 37] (Figure  5A
right panel), which significantly down-regulated
NOXA expression at both mRNA and protein level
(Figure 5B and 5C). And reduction of ROS by NAC also
attenuated apoptosis and reduced cell death (Figure 5D
and 5E). These results demonstrated that enhanced
production of ROS contributed to the induction of NOXA
and apoptosis upon MLN4924+CQ treatment in liver
cancer cells.
Finally, we determined the effect of combined
treatment of both NAC and siORC1/CDT1 on NOXA
expression and apoptosis induction. We found that the
combination of NAC and siORC1/CDT1 further reduced
the expression of NOXA and cleaved-caspase 3 compared
to NAC or siORC1/CDT1 alone (Figure 5F). These
findings further support the conclusion that both enhanced
DNA damage and elevated ROS production contributed to
the induction of NOXA and apoptosis.

Blockage of autophagy enhances the antitumor
efficacy of MLN4924 in an orthotopic model of
human liver cancer
We investigated the sensitizing effect of autophagy
blockage with CQ on the efficacy of MLN4924 in a
clinically-similar orthotopic model of HepG2-GFP
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

liver cancer. Fluorescent HepG2-GFP tumors allowed
the determination of tumor growth and progression
in real time by external and noninvasive whole-body
optical imaging [38, 39]. Compared to MLN4924
treatment alone, MLN4924+CQ inhibited tumor growth
(Figure 6A-6C) (P < 0.01) and reduced tumor weight
(P  < 0.01) (Figure 6D). During the treatment period,
no obvious side effects, such as body weight loss, were
observed (Suppl. Figure 5), indicating the combination
treatment was well tolerated by the animals. To evaluate the
enhanced antitumor mechanism of MLN4924+CQ in vivo,
tumor tissue sections were analyzed immunohistochemically
for the expression of NOXA and cleaved caspase 3, as
apoptotic markers. MLN4924+CQ substantially enhanced
the expression of NOXA and cleaved caspase 3, indicating
the activation of apoptosis in the treated tumors (Figure 6E).
These results demonstrated that the inhibition of autophagy
pathway sensitized cells to MLN4924 by inducing NOXAdependent apoptosis in vivo as well as in vitro.

DISCUSSION
Liver cancer ranks one of the most common human
malignancies worldwide, while the novel strategies for
the treatment of this deadly disease are urgently needed
[1–4]. Recently, targeting protein neddylation pathway
has emerged as an attractive anticancer strategy, as
best supported by the discovery of the specific NAE
inhibitor MLN4924 in preclinical and clinical trials
[8–14]. Moreover, the discovery of overactivation of the
neddylation pathway in human cancer further enhances
rationality of targeted therapy by inhibiting this pathway
[15–19]. However, during the process of targeting this
oncogenic pathway for anticancer therapy, pro-survival
autophagy was induced as a mechanism of drug resistance
in treated cells [20, 29]. In this study, we validated the
strategy of blockage of the autophagy response with

both pharmaceutical and genetic approaches to sensitize
liver cancer cells to investigational neddylation inhibitor
MLN4924, both in vitro and in vivo, due to the induction
of exacerbated apoptosis (Figure 6F). These preclinical
findings strongly support the further clinical investigation
of the combination therapy of autophagy-inhibitory agents
with MLN4924 in patients with liver cancer.
Mechanistically, induction of apoptosis by dual
inhibition of autophagy and the neddylation pathway
is mainly attributed to the induction of proapoptotic
BH3-only proteins (Figure 6F). Functional validation
demonstrated that the induction of NOXA, but neither
Bik nor Puma plays a critical role in the induction of
apoptosis upon MLN+CQ treatment. Previous studies
reported that MLN4924 either used as a single agent or
in combination of chemoradiotherapy also induced the
expression of BH3-only proteins to trigger apoptosis in
multiple cancer cells [15, 26]. These collective findings
highlight a critical role of the up-regulation of BH3-only
pro-apoptotic proteins in the induction of apoptosis by
targeting neddylation pathway. In addition, we observed
that MLN+CQ treatment also induced the down-regulation
of several classical anti-apoptotic proteins including
c-IAP1/2, Bcl-2, XIAP and Mcl-1 (Figure 2D). It is likely
that the down-regulation of these anti-apoptotic proteins
cooperates with NOXA to trigger apoptosis.
The induction of NOXA upon dual inhibition of
autophagy and the neddylation pathway in our study
was partially attributable to enhanced DNA damage
stress. Previous studies demonstrated that MLN4924
induces the accumulation of CRL substrates CDT1 and
ORC1, two DNA-replication licensing factors, to trigger
DNA rereplication stress and induce DNA damage stress
[28]. In this study, we found that the combination of CQ
with MLN4924 provoked enhanced DNA damage when
compared to MLN4924 alone whereas the attenuation
of DNA damage stress via simultaneous silencing of
CDT1 and ORC1 significantly reduced NOXA expression

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and apoptotic induction upon MLN+CQ treatment
(Figures  4,  6F). These findings demonstrated a casual
role of CRL-CDT1/ORC1 axis in the induction of DNA
damage stress, NOXA expression as well as apoptotic
induction for MLN+CQ-mediated anticancer therapy.
Oxidative stress induced by MLN+CQ also
contributes to the induction of NOXA, based on
the following findings that (a) MLN+CQ-induced
mitochondrial
depolarization
which
impaired
mitochondrial electron transport chain as a major source
of ROS production; (b) ROS level is significantly
elevated upon MLN+CQ treatment; and more importantly
(c) the addition of the antioxidant GSH-mimetic NAC,
a classical scavenger of ROS, dramatically reduced
NOXA expression, attenuated apoptotic induction
and cell growth suppression induced by MLN+CQ
(Figures 5, 6F). Meanwhile, ROS stress triggered by
MLN+CQ may contribute to the induction of exacerbated
DNA damage since oxidant stress serves as classical
inducer of DNA damage [26] and MLN+CQ induced the
production of excessive ROS in treated cells. In support
of this hypothesis, two recent investigations showed that
MLN4924 either as a single agent [20] or in combination
of cisplatin [26] induced elevated ROS generation and
oxidative DNA damage to trigger apoptosis.
An important question to be addressed in future
studies is the mechanism by which NOXA transactivation
is induced by MLN+CQ treatment. Tumor suppressor
p53 which is frequently mutated in human cancer [40]
is often involved in the transcriptional activation of proapoptotic proteins including NOXA [41–43]. However,
the induction of NOXA upon MLN+CQ treatment appears
p53-independent. We found that NOXA was induced in
both wild-type p53-expressing HepG2 cells [44, 45] and
mutant/inactivated p53-carrying Huh7 cells [44,  45].
Similarly, previous studies showed that, regardless of
the status of p53, NOXA could be transcriptionally
activated in response to the treatment of cancer cells

with a set of anticancer agents, including pan-proteasome
inhibitor botezomib [46, 47]. Future studies will warrant
to further address the underlying mechanisms of NOXA
transactivation in MLN+CQ-treated cells.
Targeting autophagy pathway with autophagy
inhibitors has been developed as an important strategy to
sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapeutics that induces
autophagic response as a pro-survival signal and a
major mechanism of drug resistance [24, 26]. CQ or its
derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the first generation
autophagy inhibitors, has been approved by the FDA due
to their effectiveness in vivo and safety in clinical trials
[48], although the underlying mechanisms responsible for
the action of CQ/HCQ have not been well addressed. In
the present report, we, for the first time, demonstrated the
efficacy of autophagy inhibition with CQ on neddylation
pathway-targeted therapy for human liver cancer. Our
encouraging results obtained from this study provide
a strong rationale for the further clinical evaluation
of combination with clinically applicable autophagy
inhibitors (e.g. CQ and its derivatives) and neddylation
inhibitors (e.g. MLN4924) for the treatment of patients
with liver cancer. Moreover, these strategies probably
have a broader application for other types of human
cancers since the induction of pro-survival autophagy by
neddylation inhibition is a general phenotype in many
human cancer cells [20, 29]. At the molecular level,
increased DNA damage stress, excessive ROS production,
transactivation of NOXA and induction of apoptosis
may serve as biomarkers for determining the therapeutic
response of cancer patients to this combination treatment,
which is yet to be investigated in future clinical studies.

kit (PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
For the clonogenic assay, 500 cells were seeded
into 60-mm dishes in triplicate, treated with MLN4924,
autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) or BafilomycinA1
(BafA1) alone, or in combination (MLN4924+CQ or
MLN4924+BafA1), followed by incubation for 9 days.
The colonies were fixed, stained and counted under an
inverted microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Colonies
with 50 cells or more were counted.

Acridine orange (AO) staining for
autophagy detection
Acridine orange (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) staining
was performed to detect autophagy according to
a published protocol [30, 31]. Briefly, cells were
treated and stained with 1 mM acridine orange in PBS
containing 5% FBS at 37°C for 15 minutes. Cells were
washed and observed under fluorescence microscopy
(magnification: 20 × 100; Olympus BX-51, Olympus Inc.,
Tokyo, Japan).

SiRNA knockdown of ATG7, NOXA,
Bik, Puma, ORC1 and CDT1
HepG2 and Huh7 cells were transfected with siRNA
oligonucleotides, synthesized by RIBOBIO (Guangzhou,
China) using Lipofectamine 2000. The siRNA sequences
are shown in Suppl. Table 1. Cells transiently transfected
with control siRNA or the target gene siRNA were treated
with MLN4924, CQ or MLN4924+CQ for 72 h after 24 h
transfection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Immunoblotting

Cell lines, culture, and reagents

Cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting,
using antibodies against cullin1 (Santa Cruz, Dallas,
Texas), phospho-H2AX at Ser139 (γH2AX), ATG7,
cleaved caspase 3, cleaved PARP, Pro-Apoptosis Bcl-2
Family Antibody Sampler Kit, Pro-Survival Bcl-2 Family
Antibody Sampler Kit, IAP Family Antibody Sampler
Kit, ORC1, CDT1 (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA), tubulin
(Likun Trade Co., China), NOXA (Millipore, Billerica,
MA) and LC3 (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).

Human liver cancer cell lines HepG2 and
Huh7 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection, and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Medium (Hyclone), containing 10% FBS (Biochrom
AG) and 1%  penicillin–streptomycin solution, at 37°C
with 5% CO2. MLN4924 was synthesized and prepared
as described [20]. For in vitro studies, MLN4924 was
dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at
–20°C. For in vivo studies, MLN4924 was dissolved in
10% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPBCD). The
solution of MLN4924 was freshly prepared every week
and stored in the dark at room temperature before use.

Apoptosis detection
Cells were treated with the indicated concentration
of MLN4924, CQ, BafA1, MLN4924+CQ or MLN
4924+BafA1 for 72 hours. Apoptosis was determined
with the Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Kit (BioVision,
Inc. Milpitas, California) and CaspGLOW Fluorescein
Active Caspase-3 Staining Kit (BioVision) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell viability and clonogenic survival assay
Cells were plated in 96-well plates (3 × 103 cells per
well) and treated with drugs as indicated. Cell proliferation
was determined using the ATPLite Luminescence Assay

manufacturer’s instructions. For each sample, the mRNA
abundance was normalized to the amount of GAPDH.
Primer sequences were designed and synthesized as shown
in Suppl. Table 2.

HepG2 and Huh7 cells were treated with drugs as
indicated. Mitochondrial Membrane Depolarization was
detected with the mitochondrial membrane potential assay
kit with JC-1 according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Yeasen, Shanghai, China). JC-1 is a potentiometric dye
that exhibits a membrane potential-dependent loss as
JC-1 aggregates (polarized mitochondria) transition to
JC-1 monomers (depolarized mitochondria). The loss
of membrane potential is indicated by the fluorescence
emission shift from red to green. The levels of fluorescence
intensity of the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry
(Becton Dickinson FACScan) under an excitation
wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelengths of
530  nm for green fluorescence and 585 nm for red
fluorescence.

Orthotopic mouse models of liver
cancer and treatment
Orthotopic mouse models of liver cancer were
established using HepG2-GFP liver cancer cells as
previously described [20, 38, 39, 50]. The tumor-bearing
mice were randomized into 4 groups (7 animals/group)
and treated with 10% 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin
(HPBCD) (Sigma), MLN4924 (30 mg/kg, s.c.), CQ
(Sigma) (50 mg/kg, i.p.) or MLN4924 in combination
with CQ (MLN4924+CQ) twice a day, on a 3-days-on/
2-days-off schedule for 11 cycles within 56 days. Tumor
size was measured with an Olympus OV100 imaging
system twice a week as described [20, 38, 39]. Tumor
tissues were harvested, photographed and weighed.
Animal studies were performed in accordance with animal
protocol procedures approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of Fudan University.

Immunofluorescence staining
HepG2 and Huh7 liver cancer cells were plated
on chamber slides and treated with MLN4924, CQ
or both. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated
with γH2AX primary antibody and Alexa Fluor® 488
Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) secondary antibody
(Beyotime, Hangzhou, China) respectively. The nuclei
were stained by DAPI (Beyotime). Images were captured
using fluorescence microscopy (magnification: 20 × 100;
Olympus BX-51, Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan).

Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were sectioned
to 4-μm thickness and mounted on positively-charged
microscope slides. Citric acid (Sigma) (pH 3.0) was
used for antigen retrieval. Immunohistochemistry was
performed by a GTVisionTMIII Detection System/
Mo&Rb (Gene Tech Company Limited, Shanghai, China)
using NOXA or cleaved caspase 3 antibody.

Quantification of reactive oxygen species
ROS production was monitored with the cell
permeable ROS indicator, 2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (H2-DCFDA) (Sigma), as described by
Cossarizza et al [49]. The functional role of ROS
generation in apoptosis was assessed using the free-radical
scavenger NAC (Beyotime). Cells were pre-incubated
with 50 μM NAC for 2 h, followed by co-incubation with
indicated chemicals and assessment of apoptosis or ROS
generation as described above.
