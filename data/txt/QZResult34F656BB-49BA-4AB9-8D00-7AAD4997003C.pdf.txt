BACKGROUND: In this study, the authors examined the influence of prior treatment on the course of fatigue in breast
cancer survivors. Patients who received chemotherapy were expected to have greater fatigue than patients who
received radiotherapy and noncancer controls 6 months after the completion of treatment, but they were expected
to recover to levels similar to those of the other 2 groups 3 years later. METHODS: Patients with stage 0 through II
breast cancer completed the Fatigue Symptom Inventory (FSI) and the Profile of Mood States Fatigue Scale (POMSFAT) 6 months (T1) and 42 months (T2) after completing chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy (the CT group;
n ¼ 103) or radiotherapy only (the RT group; n ¼ 102). An age-matched group of women with no history of cancer
(the NC group; n ¼ 193) was assessed over a similar interval. RESULTS: A significant (P ¼ .041) group  time effect
for FSI severity scores revealed that fatigue worsened over time in the CT group but remained stable and lower in
the RT and NC groups. There also were significant group effects for FSI days (P < .001) and POMS-FAT (P ¼ .010)
scores, indicating that fatigue was significantly greater across time in the CT group than in the NC group (POMSFAT) or the RT and NC groups (FSI days). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to expectations, fatigue did not diminish over
time in patients with breast cancer who received chemotherapy. This finding has important implications for patient
education and for fatigue monitoring during follow-up. The authors concluded that future research should seek to
examine possible mechanisms to explain the apparent prolonged impact of chemotherapy on fatigue in breast cancer

KEYWORDS: fatigue, breast cancer, chemotherapy, radiotherapy.

Fatigue is among the most common symptoms reported by women who are treated for breast cancer.1 Studies using
cross-sectional designs also demonstrate elevated fatigue after treatment completion in disease-free breast cancer survivors
relative to noncancer controls2-7 and general population norms.8 Cross-sectional studies do not provide information
about the course of post-treatment fatigue in breast cancer survivors. This limitation has been addressed in 7 longitudinal
studies.9-15 In 4 of those studies,9,10,13,15 assessments were conducted at various time points after the completion of treatment (eg, between 6 months and 70 months after treatment ended). This feature precludes the possibility of characterizing
fatigue at specific time points in the post-treatment period.
All of the other longitudinal studies conducted assessments at standard time points but differed considerably in other
respects. Nieboer et al14 assessed patients who were randomized to receive standard-dose or high-dose chemotherapy
before treatment and 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years post-treatment. Their findings indicated that there were no changes in fatigue in either group and no differences in fatigue between groups. Fan et al11 assessed patients toward the end of chemotherapy and 1 year and 2 years later and also assessed noncancer controls at similar intervals. Patients were more fatigued
than controls at the initial assessment and, although patients’ fatigue improved over time, differences with controls still
were evident 1 years and 2 years later. Geinitz et al12 assessed patients who received primarily radiotherapy before the start

of radiotherapy and again 2 months and 2.5 years posttreatment. Their findings generally indicated no changes
over time, with the exception of an increase on a global
measure of fatigue between 2 months and 2.5 years posttreatment. Overall, those studies provided conflicting evidence about changes in fatigue among breast cancer survivors who received adjuvant therapy. In addition, none of
those studies addressed the important issue of whether the
course of fatigue differs based on whether breast cancer
survivors receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy only.
In the current study, fatigue was assessed at 6 months
and 42 months after the completion of adjuvant therapy in
breast cancer survivors and at a similar time interval in a
noncancer comparison group (the NC group). Data were
used to determine whether the course of fatigue differed
between women with breast cancer who received chemotherapy (either alone or with radiotherapy) compared with
women with breast cancer who received radiotherapy only
and women who had no history of cancer. We reported
previously that fatigue was greater in the 2 patient groups at
the end of treatment compared with the NC group and
that, 6 months later, the chemotherapy group (but not the
radiotherapy group) reported more fatigue than the NC
group.16 We also reported previously that the prevalence of
fatigue based on a case definition17 declined from 22% at
the end of treatment to 13% at 42 months post-treatment
among patients who received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.18 On the basis of these and other findings,11 we
hypothesized that fatigue in the chemotherapy group
would diminish further over a 3-year follow-up period to a
level similar to that in the radiotherapy and NC groups.
Thus, we expected to detect a significant group-by-time
interaction effect on fatigue. We also considered the possibility that fatigue would remain higher over time in the
chemotherapy group relative to the other 2 groups, as demonstrated by a significant group effect.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and Procedures
Data for this report were drawn from a larger study of quality of life in women who were treated for breast cancer at the
Moffitt Cancer Center and the University of Kentucky
Chandler Medical Center. This study was approved by institutional review boards at the University of South Florida
and the University of Kentucky. Patient eligibility criteria
for the larger study were: a diagnosis of stage 0 through II
breast cancer; scheduled to receive chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both after surgery; no other history of cancer other

than basal cell skin carcinoma; no prior chemotherapy or
radiotherapy; and no conditions in which fatigue is a prominent symptom (eg, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome,
multiple sclerosis, or fibromyalgia). Additional eligibility criteria for this report were that patients completed the Time 1
(T1) assessment (6 months after completing treatment) and
had no recurrent breast cancer or new primary cancer by the
Time 2 (T2) assessment (42 months after completing treatment). Patients were recruited from November 1999 until
June 2006 and provided informed consent at time of
recruitment. Assessments were conducted approximately 6
months (T1) and 42 months (T2) after the completion of
chemotherapy (for patients who received chemotherapy
only) or radiotherapy (for patients who received radiotherapy only or radiotherapy after chemotherapy).
Each patient who completed the T1 assessment was
matched with a noncancer control (as described in detail
elsewhere16). Noncancer participants were women who
were within 5 years of age and resided in the same zip
code as their patient match. Additional eligibility criteria
were: no history of cancer (other than basal cell skin carcinoma) or other potentially life-threatening diseases and
no conditions in which fatigue is a prominent symptom
(as described above). Controls were recruited from December 2004 to January 2008. After providing informed
consent, they were assessed at baseline (T1) and approximately 3 years later (T2).
In total, 309 patients and 252 controls completed
the T1 assessment. At T2, 21 patients were excluded
because of disease recurrence or death, and 9 controls
were excluded because of breast cancer diagnosis, fibromyalgia diagnosis, or death. An additional 83 patients and
50 controls declined further participation or could not be
contacted. Thus, this report is based on 205 patients and
193 controls who completed both assessments.
The difference in study completion rates between
patients (205 of 288; 71%) and controls (193 of 243;
79%) was statistically significant (P ¼ .037). Additional
analyses revealed no significant differences (P > .05) on
any T1 fatigue index or demographic variable between the
50 controls who withdrew or could not be contacted and
the 193 controls who completed both assessments. Similarly, there were no significant differences on any T1 fatigue index or clinical variable assessed between the 83
patients who withdrew or could not be contacted and the
205 patients who completed both assessments. Patients
who withdrew or could not be contacted had less education (P ¼ .001) and lower household income (P ¼ .001)
but did not differ on other demographic variables.

Prolonged CT Impact on Fatigue/Goedendorp et al

Among patients, 102 received radiotherapy only
(RT group), and 103 received chemotherapy. There were
no significant differences between the 16 patients who
received chemotherapy only and the 87 patients who
received both chemotherapy and radiotherapy on any T1
fatigue index described below (P  .25). Therefore, chemotherapy patients who did and did not receive radiotherapy were merged into a single chemotherapy group (CT
group) for all further analyses. Study completion rates did
not differ significantly for patients who received chemotherapy only (73%), chemotherapy plus radiation (74%),
and radiation only (68%; P ¼ .565).
Measures
Demographic characteristics were assessed by self-report
at T2. Clinical characteristics were assessed in patients
through medical record reviews.
At T1 and T2, participants completed the Fatigue
Symptom Inventory (FSI),19 They rated their level of fatigue from 0 (not at all fatigued) to 10 (as fatigued as I
could be) on the day they felt most fatigued in the past
week (FSI most), on the day they felt least fatigued in the
past week (FSI least), on average in the past week (FSI average), and right now (FSI now). These items were averaged to create a composite severity score (FSI severity).20
Participants also rated the degree to which fatigue interfered in the past week from 0 (no interference) to 10
(extreme interference) with 7 aspects of functioning and
quality of life, and these ratings were averaged to create an
interference score (FSI interference). Fatigue frequency
was assessed as the number of days in the past week (range,
0-7 days) they felt fatigued (FSI days) and how much of
the day (from 0 [none] to 10 [entire]) they felt fatigued
(FSI time). Participants also completed the 7-item Profile
of Mood States Fatigue Scale (POMS-FAT),21 which provides an index of fatigue in the past week.
Statistical Analyses
Possible differences among groups on demographic variables were tested with chi-square tests for categorical variables and with 1-way analyses of variance for continuous
variables. Variables for which there were significant (P <
.05) group differences were entered as covariates in all
subsequent analyses.
To evaluate effects of time, group status, and their
interaction on fatigue, separate repeated-measures analyses of variance were carried out for each fatigue index with
time (T1 and T2) as a within-subjects factor and group
(CT, RT, or NC) as a between-subjects factor. Of princi-

pal interest was the group  time interaction effect. In the
case of significant interactions, additional comparisons
were conducted to evaluate changes over time within each
group and differences among the groups at T2. For comparisons that yielded significant group differences at T2,
the Cohen d was calculated to determine the effect size
(small effect, d ¼ 0.2; medium effect, d ¼ 0.5; or large
effect, d ¼ 0.8).22 For analyses that did not yield significant interaction effects, the analysis focused on the group
effect. In the case of significant group effects, comparisons
were conducted to evaluate the magnitude of differences
between pairs of groups across T1 and T2. For comparisons that yielded significant differences, the Cohen f was
calculated to determine the effect size (small effect, f ¼
0.10; medium effect, f ¼ 0.25; or large effect, f ¼ 0.40).22
If a significant difference between groups was
observed, then additional analyses were conducted to evaluate the clinical meaningfulness of the difference at T2. In
these analyses, participants’ fatigue scores were classified
as ‘‘abnormal,’’ using criteria similar to those used in our
prior research,16 if they scored >1 standard deviation
(SD) above the mean of the NC group at T2 on the measure being evaluated. Scores of this magnitude would be
expected to occur in <16% of individuals for normally
distributed variables. A mean difference on a measure was
then considered clinically meaningful if chi-square analyses indicated that the percentages of patients with abnormal scores at T2 differed significantly among the 3
groups.
A 2-tailed P value of .05 was used as the criterion for
statistical significance. Rather than correcting the significance level for the number of comparisons performed,
which has the potential to increase the probability of Type
II error, we chose to limit the number of comparisons performed based on the outcome of significance tests of
group  time effects and group effects. With 398 participants, power was approximately 0.8 with the stated P
value to detect an interaction effect size of f ¼ 0.08 and a
group effect size of f ¼ 0.14. Analyses were performed
using the SPSS software package (version 17.0; SPSS Inc,
Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Preliminary Analyses
Participant demographic characteristics are presented in
Table 1. The CT group was significantly younger than the
RT and NC groups. Also, mean time between assessments
was significantly longer in the RT group than in the NC

group. On the basis of these findings, age and time
between assessments were used as covariates in all further
analyses.
Clinical characteristics of the RT and CT groups are
presented in Table 2. Patients in the CT group, as
expected, were more likely to have undergone mastectomy, have more advanced disease, and be further in time
from cancer diagnosis at T1 than patients in the RT
group. The RT group was more likely to have received
hormone treatment than the CT group.

Main Analyses
Means and SDs for fatigue scores for each group at T1
and T2 are presented in Table 3, and the results of statistical comparisons are presented in Table 4. There were no
significant time effects for any of the fatigue indices
(results not shown). Analyses of composite FSI severity
scores yielded a significant group  time effect (see Fig.
1). FSI severity increased in the CT group (P ¼ .007)
from T1 to T2 but not in the RT group (P ¼ .569) or the
NC group (P ¼ .892). Consistent with this pattern, FSI
severity at T2 was higher in the CT group compared with
the RT group (P ¼ .009; d ¼ 0.38) and the NC group (P
¼ .017; d ¼ 0.30).

3836

On the basis of this significant interaction, analyses
were undertaken of the 4 components of the FSI severity
score. Group  time effects were significant for FSI most
and FSI least scores (see Figs. 2 and 3). FSI most scores
increased from T1 to T2 in the CT group (P ¼ .017) but
not in the RT group (P ¼ .147) or the NC group (P ¼
.220). FSI most scores for the CT group at T2 did not differ from those for the RT group (P ¼ .102) or the NC
group (P ¼ .198). FSI least scores also increased in the
CT group from T1 to T2 (P ¼ .032) but not in the RT
group (P ¼ .358) or the NC group (P ¼ .130). Consistent
with this pattern, FSI least scores at T2 were higher in the
CT group compared with the RT group (P ¼ .001; d ¼
0.43) and the NC group (P ¼ .008; d ¼ 0.28). Although
the group  time effect for FSI now scores was not significant, the group effect was significant. Comparisons
revealed that FSI now scores were higher across time in
the CT group compared with the NC group (P ¼ .022; f
¼ 0.14) but not the RT group (P ¼ .079). No significant
group  time or group effect was observed for FSI average
scores.
No significant group  time effect was observed for
FSI days scores; however, the group effect was significant.
The number of days participants felt fatigued was higher
across time in the CT group than in the RT group (P ¼

No significant group  time or group effects were

Clinical Meaningfulness of Mean Differences
On the basis of the pattern of significant mean differences
observed between groups, additional analyses were undertaken to determine the clinical meaningfulness of the differences in FSI severity, FSI days, and POMS-FAT scores
at T2. The relation between group membership and rates
of abnormal scores at T2 approached significance for FSI
severity scores (P ¼ .052); 29% of the CT group scored in

of the RT group and 19% of the NC group. There was a
significant relation between group membership and rates
of abnormal scores at T2 for FSI days scores (P ¼ .007);
37% of the CT group scored in the abnormal range on
this measure compared with 25% of the RT group and
20% of the NC group. There also was a significant relation between group membership and rates of abnormal
scores at T2 for POMS-FAT scores (P ¼ .024); 25% of
the CT group scored in the abnormal range on this measure compared with 14% of the RT and 14% of the NC
group.
Additional Analyses
Analyses were undertaken to determine whether prescription of hormone therapy to patients at T1 was related to
fatigue outcomes. There were no significant effects of
group (any hormone therapy prescribed or no hormone
therapy prescribed) or group  time on FSI severity scores

the RT and NC groups. On other indices (ie, current fatigue, days fatigued, and past week fatigue), fatigue did
not change over time in the CT group and remained
higher than in the NC comparison group across the follow-up period. Differences between the CT group and
the RT group or the NC control group generally were indicative of medium-sized effects and were clinically meaningful. No differences in fatigue were evident between the
RT and NC groups or between patients based on whether
or not they were prescribed hormone therapy.
Findings that indicate greater fatigue in patients
who receive chemotherapy are consistent with prior
research. Several cross-sectional studies8,23,24 and longitudinal studies9,16 have reported greater fatigue among
breast cancer survivors who received chemotherapy compared with those who received no adjuvant therapy or
other forms of adjuvant therapy. Similarly, several crosssectional studies3,6 and longitudinal studies11 have
reported greater fatigue in breast cancer survivors who
received chemotherapy compared with noncancer controls. The current study extends previous findings by identifying specific time points (ie, 6 months and 42 months
after treatment completion) when differences are evident.
It also extends previous research by providing 1 of the few
planned comparisons between breast cancer survivors who
received chemotherapy versus radiotherapy only.

Original Article

The finding in the current study that fatigue severity worsened over time in chemotherapy-treated patients
is not consistent with prior research. Other studies of the
course of fatigue indicated either that it improved over
time11 or that it remained stable14 in chemotherapytreated breast cancer survivors. One possible explanation
for why 3 different patterns of change have been detected
in these 3 studies is differences in the research methodology. These differences include the measures used to assess
fatigue and the timing of the post-treatment assessments.
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the samples also differ. The average age of patients in the current
study was 55 years compared with an average age of 46
years and a median age of 48 years in the other studies.
In addition, patients in the current study were less likely
to be treated with fluorouracil and were more likely to be
treated with a taxane compared with patients in the previous studies. The latter treatment difference may not be
relevant, because we observed no evidence in the current
study to indicate that the administration of a taxane
influenced the course of fatigue. Differences in supportive care also may be an explanation; however, data bearing on this possibility were not available across the 3
studies.
In contrast to the findings obtained for fatigue severity, group membership was not associated significantly
with the degree to which fatigue interfered with functioning and quality of life. However, there was a marginally
significant group  time interaction (P ¼ .099), with a
trend for fatigue interference to worsen in the CT group
while remaining relatively stable in the other 2 groups.
One possible explanation for the lack of greater differences on this measure may be the tendency for patients to
accommodate their lifestyle as a means of coping with fatigue.25 In other words, patients may have become accustomed to the impact of heightened fatigue on their lives
over the 36-month follow-up period, thereby blunting the
extent to which it was experienced as disruptive.
Assuming replication of the finding that fatigue severity worsens over time in chemotherapy-treated
patients, future research should seek to identify underlying mechanisms. One possible mechanism is weight gain.
Weight gain commonly occurs among breast cancer
patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy,26 and few
patients return to their pretreatment weight in subsequent
years.27 Furthermore, there is evidence that an increase in
weight from pretreatment to 6 months after treatment in
patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy is associated
with an increase in fatigue.28

Several limitations of the current study should be
acknowledged. First, patients who withdrew or could not
be contacted had less education and household income
compared with patients who completed both assessments.
Thus, the education and income levels of the final patient
sample did not reflect the larger group that completed the
first assessment. Second, the sample was comprised primarily of white women and women with middle or
greater household incomes. Consequently, our findings
may not be generalizable to minority women and lower
income women. Third, the study did not investigate possible mechanisms underlying the increase in fatigue severity observed among patients who received chemotherapy.
Although weight gain is proposed as 1 possible mechanism, it could not be examined because of the lack of data
on body mass index at T1. Likewise, we were unable to
examine the possible contributory role of chemotherapyinduced menopause. Fourth, we cannot rule out the possibility that the heightened fatigue evident in the CT group
in the post-treatment period may simply reflect the continued presence of pretreatment differences relative to the
RT group and the NC group. However, results indicating
that the severity of fatigue actually increased in the CT
group in the post-treatment period seem to argue against
this possibility.
Our findings have important clinical implications.
Clinical practice guidelines recommend the continued
monitoring of cancer patients for fatigue in the post-treatment period.29 Our results support this recommendation
and suggest that continued monitoring is particularly important for breast cancer survivors who receive chemotherapy. Another implication concerns patient education.
Cancer patients often are told that their fatigue will diminish gradually after treatment completion. Our results
suggest that health care providers communicate to breast
cancer patients, particularly those who are receiving chemotherapy, the possibility that fatigue may not improve
over time and possibly may worsen. At the same time,
patients should be informed of interventions that are
effective against fatigue in the post-treatment period, such
as cognitive behavior therapy30 and exercise.31
