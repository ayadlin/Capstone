ABSTRACT
Hybrid anticancer drugs are of great therapeutic interests as they can potentially
overcome the deficiencies of conventional chemotherapy drugs and improve the
efficacy. Many studies have revealed that the combination of histone deacetylase
inhibitors (HDACi) and alkylating agents have synergistic effects. We reported a
novel hybrid NL-101, in which the side chain of bendamustine was replaced with
the hydroxamic acid of HDACi vorinostat (SAHA). NL-101 exhibited efficient antiproliferative activity on myeloid leukemia cells especially Kasumi-1 and NB4 cells,
accompanied by S phase arrest and caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. Importantly, it
presented both the properties of HDAC inhibition and DNA damaging, as assessed
by the acetylation of histone H3 and DNA double-strand breaks marker γ-H2AX. NL101 also down-regulated the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL which was
involved in the mitochondrial death pathway. Meanwhile, NL-101 induced apoptosis
and DNA damage in primary cells from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. NL-101
treatment could significantly prolong the survival time of t(8;21) leukemia mice with
enhanced efficacy than bendamustine. These data demonstrate that NL-101 could be
a potent and selective agent for leukemia treatment.

INTRODUCTION

over-expression or aberrant recruitment by fusion proteins,
is commonly observed in leukemia and lymphoma [3, 4].
Several clinical trials have demonstrated HDACi had
preferential efficacy in hematological malignancies with
a good safety profile [5-7]. Vorinostat (Suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid, SAHA), belonging to the hydroxamic
acid class, has been used for treatment of cutaneous T cell
lymphoma with the FDA approval [8].
The synergistic effects of HDACi in combination
with conventional alkylating agents have been validated
in preclinical studies [9-11]. According to the recent
research, HDACi synergistically enhanced the anticancer
activity of bendamustine in multiple myeloma cells [12].
Bendamustine is a bifunctional compound, possessing the
activity of alkylating and purine analogue agents. Clinical
trials using bendamustine in combination with first

Despite the introduction of novel targeted therapies
in the treatment of cancer, chemotherapies remain as
primary therapy in clinical treatment for both solid
tumors and hematologic malignancies. However, almost
all chemotherapeutic agents give rise to severe toxicities
and other undesirable side effects. The research for agents
which have both remarkable potency and lower side
effects is of significance.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) represent
a novel class of targeted drugs which alter acetylation
of chromatin-associated histones [1], as well as a range
of non-histone substrates, including gene transcription
factors involved in regulation of cell proliferation,
migration and death [2]. Dysregulation of HDACs through

line agents have shown notable results for treatment of
hematological malignancies, including chronic lymphoid
leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [13-17].
In theory, hyperacetylation of histone proteins induced
by HDACi could alter chromatin to an open structure,
increase the accessibility of DNA and consequently
potentiate the anticancer activities of DNA damaging
agents [18-20]. Moreover, HDACi upregulate the
acetylation status of DNA repair proteins and degrade their
cytoprotective function [21, 22]. The above suggest the
rationality of integrating the HDACi with bendamustine
within a molecule. In this study, we reported the agent
NL-101 which comprises those two chemoactive groups,
and possess the dual mechanism of HDAC inhibition and

DNA damaging. The compound exhibited potent antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity towards AML cells
both in vitro and in vivo.

chain to increases the water solubility [23, 24]. SAHA
exerts its inhibitory effect via binding to the zinc domain
in HDAC enzymes [25]. The six-carbon-long aliphatic
chain terminated with a hydroxamic acid is essential for
its HDAC binding. We postulated that introduction of
the hydroxamic acid to bendamustine would keep the
positive attributes of both drugs. Thus the compound was
synthesized by replacing butyric acid in bendamustine
by hydroxamic acid chain. For the sake of the patent
protection, the chemical structural formula was not shown
here.

We first tested its biological effect on a broad range
of human leukemia cell lines using MTT assay. Cells were
exposed to NL-101 at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to
20 μmol/L, and fifty percent of inhibitiory concentration
(IC50) was measured at 48 hours. As shown in Figure 1A,
NL-101 exhibited anti-proliferation potency in all the
leukemia cell lines examined. Kasumi-1 and NB4 cells
were most sensitive and cell growth was inhibited in a

dose- and time-dependent manner with the IC50 values of
0.82 μM and 0.9 μM at 48 h, respectively (Figure 1B). The
growth of myeloid leukemia cells KG1-a, HL60 and K562
cells were also inhibited, and the sensitivity of malignant
lymphoid cell lines Raji and Jurkat cells was relatively
lower. Importantly, NL-101 treatment was tolerated by
non-malignant cells HEK293 and HS-5 with the IC50
values more than 30 μM.
In addition, we compared the anti-proliferative effect
of NL-101 with bendamustine and SAHA in Kasumi-1 and
NB4 cells. The potency of NL-101 showed far superior
to that of bendamustine, while similar with SAHA
(Figure 1C). These results indicated that introducing
HDAC inhibitory moiety may improve the efficacy of
bendamustine. We further tested the combination of
SAHA and bendamustine in myeloid leukemia cells

and did find the synergism on the cell growth inhibition
(Supplementary Figure S1).

NL-101 induces S-phase arrest and caspase-3
dependent apoptosis in AML cells
Cell cycle analysis revealed that NL-101
induced S-phase arrest in Kasumi-1 and NB4 cells. As
demonstrated in Figure 2A, the cell fraction at S-phase
increased from (37.4±1.7)% to (52.5±7.4)% in Kasumi-1
cells and (44.9±6.1)% to (62.9±2.4)% in NB4 cells
respectively, after exposure to 2 μmol/L of NL-101
for 12 hours. Moreover, an increase in the sub-G0/G1
cell population, which is the characteristic of apoptotic
cells, was observed after more than 24 hours treatment
especially in Kasumi-1 cells.

NL-101 prolongs survival of t(8;21) leukemia mice

Apoptosis analysis further confirmed that NL-101
induced massive apoptosis in Kasumi-1 cells with majority
of cells dead after 48 hours exposure; while in NB4 cells,
treatment with 2 μmol/L of NL-101 killed nearly half of
cells with levels slightly lower than that of SAHA (Figure
2B). Two apoptosis markers, cleaved caspase-3 and its
substrate PARP were also detected in both cell lines after
24 h of treatment (Figure 2C).

To determine whether NL-101 was capable of
suppressing leukemia development in vivo, we generated
the transplantable mouse model coexpressing AML1ETO and HyC-KITD816V [26]. Recipient mice developed
aggressive acute leukemia with extensive infiltrations
of immature blast cells (C-KIT+, Gr1−, CD11b−) in
hematopoietic organs (Figure 5A). For in vivo treatment,
recipients of leukemia mice were administered NL-101
(30 mg/kg), bendamustine (30 mg/kg), SAHA (50 mg/
kg) or placebo for 2 days beginning on day 10 after
transplantation.
The mice body weight and GFP+ cells in peripheral
blood were monitored during the observation period. On
day 20, both the peripheral WBC count and the percentage
of GFP+ cells decreased in NL-101 and bendamustine
treated mice compared with that of placebo group.
Splenomegaly was observed in mice treated with placebo,
while the spleen size was nearly normal in NL-101 treated
mice (Figure 5B). In addition, there was no significant
difference in the average body weight between control and
treated mice (Figure 5C). From approximately 3 weeks
after transplantation, mice in the placebo and SAHA group
succumbed to the disease rapidly, whereas mice treated
with NL-101 and bendamustine showed a longer survival
time. The median survival was 33 days among mice
receiving bendamustine; while in the NL-101 group, there
were 3 mice still alive at the end of the 50-day observation
period (Figure 5D).

NL-101 induces HDAC inhibition and DNA
damage
To address whether the cytotoxic activities could
be explained by the potency of two pharmacophores
involved, we tested a possible HDAC inhibition and
DNA damage effect of NL-101 by examining the level
of acetylated histone protein and phosphorylation of
H2AX (γ-H2AX) via Western blot analysis. As shown
in Figure 3A, both cell lines with NL-101 treatment
displayed moderate time- and dose-dependent increase in
the acetylated histone H3. Meanwhile, NL-101 induced
distinct accumulation of DNA damage marker γ-H2AX
with prolongation of exposure time (Figure 3B).
Since the involvement of Bcl-2 family proteins
in DNA damage-induced apoptosis has been well
established, we monitored the expressions of the family
members including anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL, Bcl2 and pro-apoptotic protein Bax. The expression level
of Bcl-xL decreased in both cell lines and Bax increased
in NB4 cells, while Bcl-2 displayed no change at the
concentrations and time tested (Figure 3C). Besides,
Bcl-xL decreased within hours of exposure and became
obvious at 48 hours, prior to the caspase activation and
apoptosis. These results suggest that the cytotoxity of
NL-101 in AML cells could be attributed to the effect of
HDAC inhibition and DNA damaging.

DISCUSSION
There is evidence for the synergistic effect of
combined DNA damaging agents and HDAC inhibitors
on cancer cells. However, traditional combination therapy
of two individual drugs may possess disadvantages,
including pharmacokinetic differences and drug-drug
interactions. Instead, the combination of two different
acting compounds into one hybrid can convey the
synergy effects and lead to an improved pharmacological
potency. Here, we disclosed a novel compound NL-101
synthesized by combining the hydroxamic acid moiety
and the structure of nitrogen mustard. In this context,
HDACi activity is integrated into the skeleton of DNA
alkylating agent. To systematically evaluate its activity,
NL-101(NSC-751447) was tested in the NCI’s anticancer
drug screen against 60 human cancer cell lines [27]. The
screen results demonstrated its cytotoxicity against a wide
range of cancer cell lines, with IC50 similar to SAHA and
35-fold lower than bendamustine on average. In addition,
COMPARE analysis showed that no compounds in the
NCI’s database had similar mechanisms as NL-101,
indicating its unique features that compensate it from the
conventional DNA alkylating agents and HDACi.

NL-101 triggers apoptosis of leukemia cells from
AML patients
Given the pro-apoptotic properties exhibited in
leukemia cell lines, we next determined the effects of
NL-101 on human primary leukemia cells. Bone marrow
mononuclear cells from 10 AML patients and three healthy
donors were isolated and incubated with NL-101 for up to
48 hours. BMMNCs from patients showed morphologic
characteristics of apoptosis, such as shrinking cytoplasm,
nuclear fragmentation with intact cell membrane and
vacuolar degeneration. In contrast, cells from normal
adults were only slightly affected by NL-101 (Figure 4A).
The apoptotic effects were also confirmed by the cleavage
of PARP and caspase-3, and the increased γ-H2AX (Figure
4B).

Our initial study in vitro demonstrated that NL101 inhibited the growth of all the leukemia cells tested.
Kasumi-1 and NB4 cells were most sensitive, and normal
cell lines were more resistant to NL-101 treatment.
Previous studies have demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors
are potent particularly in AML with AML1/ETO and
PML-RARα fusion proteins since they can recruit
HDAC-containing complexes and provide targets for
HDAC inhibitors [28]. In addition, HDACi are known
for their selective cytotoxicity that discriminated between
normal and malignant cells. These observations raised the
question of whether NL-101 had the property of HDAC
inhibition. We therefore examined the level of histone
acetylation and found the accumulation of acetylated

H3 in a concentration and time-dependent manner with
the NL-101 treatment. These may suggest that NL-101
targeted the HDAC, and the effect of HDAC inhibition
contributed to its anti-proliferative activities.
For the other aspect, bendamustine is known to
induce DNA cross-links that initiates a DNA damage
response [29, 30]. Our results showed that NL-101 could
lead to the phosphorylation of H2AX, which is the early
response after formation of DNA double-strand breaks
(DSB) and important for recruiting DNA repair proteins
[31-33]. In addition, NL-101 treatment resulted in S phase
arrest and the degradation of anti-apoptotic protein BclxL. S phase arrest is the prominent effect of DNA damage,
providing time for the repair or cellular apoptosis [18].

Cell lines, primary AML samples and culture
conditions

Bcl-2 family proteins affect the mitochondrial death
pathway and regulate the apoptotic process induced by
DNA damage, responsible for the anticancer effect of both
HDAC inhibitor and DNA damaging agent [34-36]. These
findings demonstrate that NL-101 possesses the activity of
both SAHA and bendamustine.
Finally, the potency of NL-101 on Kasumi-1 cells
was further confirmed in vivo. For the murine experiment,
AML1-ETO expression may not be sufficient for AML,
but it could cooperate with activating mutations of
C-KIT in the induction of fatal AML. Thus we used the
mouse model coexpressing AML1-ETO and C-KIT D816V
to compare efficacy of NL-101 with bendamustine and
SAHA. Our results indicate that NL-101 significantly
inhibited the growth of leukemia cells and prolonged
survival compared to the control. NL-101 also exhibited
enhanced anticancer potency than bendamustine, which
might represent that the introducing of HDACi moiety did
enhance the effect of NL-101. SAHA application as single
agent showed no efficacy in this aggressive leukemia
model, and a better effect may be observed by increasing
the dosage and the administration times. In addition,
NL-101 was well tolerated in leukemia mice without
significant weight loss.
In conclusion, the novel compound NL-101
inhibited the proliferation and induced cellular apoptosis
of a wide range of leukemia cell lines. It also showed
therapeutic response in blasts from AML patients and in
t(8;21) murine model. Through the rational combination
of HDAC inhibitors and alkylating agents, the potency
of NL-101 appeared to exceed both bendamustine and
SAHA. These results provide evidence that NL-101 would
be effective and promising for the treatment of AML.

The following human cell lines were used: AML
with t(8;21) translocation (Kasumi-1), acute promyelocytic
leukemia (NB4 and HL-60), acute myelomonocytic
leukemia (U937), acute myeloid leukemia (KG1-a),
chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562), Burkitt’s
lymphoma (Raji), B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(Nalm6), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Jurkat),
human embryonic kidney 293 cells and HS-5 stromal cells.
Bone marrow samples of AML patients and healthy donors
were obtained from the Institute of Hematology and Blood
Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences
and Peking Union Medical College. An informed consent
from each patient was provided. The characteristics of
these patients are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Bone
marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) were isolated by
density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll solution (TBD
Science, China). Both leukemia cell lines and BMMNCs
were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum.

Growth inhibition assay and evaluation of drug
synergy
Cellular growth inhibition was evaluated using the
MTT assay. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a
density of 2×103 to 2×104 cells and treated with various
concentrations of drugs for 24, 48 and 72 hours. The
control cells were exposed to DMSO at a concentration
equal to that in drug-treated cells. MTT was added to a
final concentration of 1 mM. After 4 hours, formazan
crystals were dissolved by addition of 100 µl of 10%
SDS and overnight incubation. Absorbance was measured
with Synergy H4 Hybrid Microplate Reader (Biotek,
USA) at 546 nm. The effect of combining SAHA with
bendamustine on cellular growth inhibition was evaluated
by calculating the combination index (CI) as described
by Chou and Talalay [37]. CI values less than 1 represent
synergistic effects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
NL-101, bendamustine and SAHA were supplied
by Hangzhou Minsheng Institute of Pharmaceutical
Research (Hangzhou, China). Compounds were dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma, USA) and diluted
with cell culture medium for in vitro studies. DMSO was
used as the vehicle control with a final concentration
below 0.1% of total volume. For administration to mice,
NL-101 and bendamustine was dissolved with normal
saline to 3 mg/mL. SAHA was dissolved in a vehicle of
DMSO and diluted freshly with PBS when used (final
concentration of DMSO was 2%).

Flow cytometry
The drug effects on cell cycle distribution and
apoptosis in AML cell lines were analyzed by flow
cytometry (LSRII, BD, USA). For cell cycle assay,
cells were treated for 12 h with/without drug, fixed in
70% ethanol for 24 h at 4℃, and stained with 20 µg/ml
propidium iodide (Sigma, USA) containing 10 μg/ml
RNaseA for 15–30 min. Cell apoptosis rate was quantified
by double staining with Annexin-V and propidium iodide

Two of the authors of this manuscript, Qiufu Ge
and Dianwu Guo are employees of Hangzhou Minsheng
Institute of Pharmaceutical Research. They designed and
synthesized NL-101 used in this study. The remaining
authors declare no competing financial interests.

To establish the primary t(8;21) leukemia mouse
model, hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from
C57BL/6 mice and transduced twice with equivalent titer
of retrovirus encoding MSCV-AML1/ETO-IRES-GFP
and MSCV-HyC-KITD816V-IRES-GFP [38]. The recipient
C57BL/6 mice were lethally irradiated at 900 cGy and
intravenously transplanted with the transduced cells. The
mice developed fetal leukemia and leukemic cells could be
transplanted serially.
For in vivo drug treatment, 5×105 GFP+ spleen cells
from moribund mice in the third generation were injected
intravenously to sublethally irradiated mice. Ten days after
cell implantation, mice were randomized into treatment
and control groups. The treatment group received 30 mg/
kg NL-101 or bendamustine intravenously, or 50 mg/kg
SAHA intraperitoneally for 2 days. The control group
received the equivalent volume of placebo. The leukemia
development was assessed by peripheral white blood
cell counts using the hematology analyzer (Sysmex XT2000i, Japan) and percentages of circulating GFP+ cells by
flow cytometry. The mice were weighed every other day
during the experimental period to assess toxicity of the
treatments. The overall survival was measured from the
date of transplantation until death. All animal experiments
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Peking Union Medical College.
