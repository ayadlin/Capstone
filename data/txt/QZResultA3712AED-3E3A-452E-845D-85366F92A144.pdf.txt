ABSTRACT
Pirinixic acid derivatives, a new class of drug candidates for a range of diseases,
interfere with targets including PPARa, PPARg, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), and microsomal
prostaglandin and E2 synthase-1 (mPGES1). Since 5-LO, mPGES1, PPARa, and PPARg
represent potential anti-cancer drug targets, we here investigated the effects of 39
pirinixic acid derivatives on prostate cancer (PC-3) and neuroblastoma (UKF-NB-3)
cell viability and, subsequently, the effects of selected compounds on drug-resistant
neuroblastoma cells. Few compounds affected cancer cell viability in low micromolar
concentrations but there was no correlation between the anti-cancer effects and the
effects on 5-LO, mPGES1, PPARa, or PPARg. Most strikingly, pirinixic acid derivatives
interfered with drug transport by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB1
in a drug-specific fashion. LP117, the compound that exerted the strongest effect on
ABCB1, interfered in the investigated concentrations of up to 2μM with the ABCB1mediated transport of vincristine, vinorelbine, actinomycin D, paclitaxel, and calceinAM but not of doxorubicin, rhodamine 123, or JC-1. In silico docking studies identified
differences in the interaction profiles of the investigated ABCB1 substrates with the
known ABCB1 binding sites that may explain the substrate-specific effects of LP117.
Thus, pirinixic acid derivatives may offer potential as drug-specific modulators of
ABCB1-mediated drug transport.

and γ-secretase at varying potencies [3–8]. This makes
pirinixic acid derivatives drug candidates for pathological
states including dyslipidemia, diabetes, metabolic
syndrome, hypertension, cardiovascular disease,
Alzheimer’s disease, and inflammation-related diseases
[2,9–13].
5-LO, mPGES1, PPARα, and PPARγ are also
potential drug targets for anti-cancer therapies [14–17].
However, pirinixic acid derivatives had not been tested
for anti-cancer activity, yet. Thus, we here investigated
39 pirinixic acid derivatives for their effects on the

INTRODUCTION
Pirinixic acid (WY-14,643) was discovered as
a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α
agonist in 1974 [1] and is related to the fibrates that are
in clinical use for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia
and hypertriglyceridemia [2]. In the meantime, a
substantial number of pirinixic acid derivatives were
synthesized that interfere with targets including PPARα,
PPARγ, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), cyclooxygenase (COX),
microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 (mPGES1),

viability of a prostate cancer (PC-3) and a neuroblastoma
(UKF-NB-3) cell line and, subsequently, the effects of
selected compounds on drug-resistant neuroblastoma
cells. Few compounds affected cancer cell viability in low
micromolar concentrations but there was no correlation
between the anti-cancer effects and the effects on 5-LO,
mPGES1, PPARα, or PPARγ. Most strikingly, pirinixic
acid derivatives interfered with drug transport by the ATPbinding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCB1 (also known
as P-glycoprotein or MDR1) in a drug-specific fashion,
i.e. they interfered with the ABCB1-mediated transport of
only a subset of the investigated ABCB1 substrates.

for LP123 in UKF-NB-3 cells (2.04 ± 0.69μM) (Figure 1,
Suppl. Table 1).

Effects of selected pirinixic acid derivatives
on the viability of drug-resistant
neuroblastoma cells
Next we compared the effects of pirinixic acid,
HZ51, LP117, LP123, YS71, and YS80 on the viability
of the cell line UKF-NB-3 and its sub-lines with acquired
resistance to cisplatin (UKF-NB-3rCDDP1000), doxorubicin
(UKF-NB-3rDOX20), and vincristine (UKF-NB-3rVCR10).
In addition, we determined the effects of these compounds
on the viability of Be(2)-C cells. Be(2)-C is a clonal subline of the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE(2) that was
isolated from a neuroblastoma patient after repeated
courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy [18] and that
displays multi-drug resistance [19,20].
All cell lines were again insensitive to pirinixic acid
in concentrations up to 100μM (Figure 2, Suppl. Table 2).
The drug-resistant UKF-NB-3 sub-lines were similarly or
less sensitive to HZ51, LP117, LP123, YS71, and YS80
relative to UKF-NB-3. All three drug-resistant UKF-NB-3
sub-lines displayed substantial cross-resistance to LP123.
The fold changes IC50 resistant UKF-NB-3 sub-line/ UKFNB-3 ranged from 20.19 to 28.66. UKF-NB-3rDOX20 cells
were substantially (>2-fold) more resistant to HZ51 and
LP117 than UKF-NB-3 cells. All other fold changes (IC50
resistant UKF-NB-3 sub-line/ UKF-NB-3) were >0.5 and
<2 (Figure 2, Suppl. Table 2). Be(2)-C cells displayed
decreased sensitivity to LP117 compared to UKF-NB-3
and similar sensitivity to the other tested compounds
(Figure 2, Suppl. Table 2).

RESULTS
Effects of pirinixic acid derivatives on cancer cell
viability
The effects of pirinixic acid and its 39 derivatives
were determined on UKF-NB-3 neuroblastoma and PC-3
prostate carcinoma cell viability (Figure 1, Suppl. Table
1). To compare the effects of the compounds in the two
cell lines they were classified according to their activities
into compounds that did not reduce cell viability by 50%
(IC50) in the tested concentration range up to 100μM,
compounds that displayed IC50s between 10μM and
100μM, and compounds that displayed IC50s below 10μM.
Although there were substantial similarities between the
effects of most compounds on the viability of both cell
lines, there were also some substantial differences (Figure
1, Suppl. Table 1).
18 compounds including pirinixic acid showed
IC50 values >100μM in both cell lines. 11 compounds
displayed IC50 values between 10μM and 100μM in UKFNB-3 and PC-3 cells. Three compounds (HZ25, HZ49,
HZ51) showed IC50 values between 10μM and 100μM
in UKF-NB-3 cells but IC50s >100μM in PC-3 cells.
Five compounds (HZ34, HZ37, HZ55, HZ74, LP119)
displayed IC50 values <100μM and >10μM in PC-3 cells
but IC50 values >100μM in UKF-NB-3. Three compounds
(HZ53, LP123, YS80) had IC50 values <10μM in UKFNB-3 cells and IC50 values >10μM and <100μM in
PC-3 cells. Notably, there was no significant difference
between the IC50 value of YS80 in UKF-NB-3 cells (9.87
± 1.19μM) and in PC-3 cells (11.61 ± 7.83μM) although
they were classified into different categories (Figure 1,
Suppl. Table 1).
Compounds that were >2 times more effective in
UKF-NB-3 cells than in PC-3 cells (fold change IC50
PC-3/ IC50 UKF-NB-3 >2) included HZ49 (fold change
>7.5), HZ51 (fold change 3.9), HZ53 (fold change 2.3),
and LP123 (fold change 28.5). Compounds that were >2
times more effective in PC-3 than in UKF-NB-3 cells (fold
change IC50 UKF-NB-3/ IC50 PC-3 >2) included HZ37
(fold change >5.6), HZ74 (fold change >4.7), and LP119
(fold change >3.2). The lowest IC50 value was determined

Effects of selected pirinixic acid derivatives on
the vincristine sensitivity of vincristine-resistant
UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells
Next, we investigated the effects of a range of
pirinixic acid derivatives that had displayed varying effects
on UKF-NB-3 neuroblastoma cell sensitivity (HZ25,
IC50 67.64 ± 31.39μM; HZ37, IC50 >100μM; HZ59, IC50
>100μM; LP117, IC50 29.36 ± 12.42μM; YS71, IC50 26.51
± 1.94μM; YS80, IC50 9.87 ± 1.19μM; YS81, >100μM,
Figure 1, Suppl. Table 1) on the vincristine sensitivity of
the vincristine-resistant UKF-NB-3 sub-line UKF-NB3rVCR10. In the absence of vincristine, these compounds
had exerted similar effects on the viability of UKF-NB-3
and UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells (IC50 UKF-NB-3rVCR10/IC50
UKF-NB-3 >0.5 and <2): HZ25, IC50 >100μM; HZ37,
IC50 >100μM; HZ59, IC50 > 100μM; LP117, IC50 33.39
± 9.11μM; YS71, IC50 33.25 ± 2.30μM; YS80, IC50 17.16
± 0.80μM; YS81, >100μM (Figure 2, Suppl. Table 2).
All tested pirinixic acid derivatives sensitized UKF-NB3rVCR10 cells to vincristine (Figure 3A, Suppl. Table 3).

paclitaxel-resistant UKF-NB-3 sub-line UKF-NB-3rPCL10
to vincristine (Figure 3B, Suppl. Table 4). In contrast,
LP117 did neither sensitize non-ABCB1-expressing UKFNB-3 cells to vincristine (Suppl. Table 4) nor ABCB1expressing UKF-NB-3rVCR10 or UKF-NB-3rDOX20 cells
to the non-ABCB1 substrate cisplatin (Suppl. Table 5).
LP117 further sensitized UKF-NB-3rVCR10
cells to the ABCB1 substrates vinorelbine, paclitaxel,
and actinomycin D but not to the ABCB1 substrate

to 2μM (Figure 4, Suppl. Table 6). Similar results were

reduced the vincristine IC50 in UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells in
low micromolar concentrations (Figure 3A, Suppl. Table
3). LP117 (2μM) also sensitized the vincristine-resistant
ABCB1-expressing neuroblastoma cell lines IMR32rVCR10 and UKF-NB-2rVCR10, the ABCB1-expressing
neuroblastoma cell line UKF-NB-4 that was isolated as
multi-drug resistant cell line from a patient [19,20,22],

obtained in the vincristine-resistant ABCB1-expressing
rhabdomyosarcoma cell line Rh30rVCR10 (Figure 4, Suppl.
Table 7). These data suggest that LP117 predominantly
interferes with the ABCB1-mediated transport of certain
ABCB1 substrates. In concordance, LP117 sensitized
UKF-NB-3rDOX20 and UKF-NB-3rPCL10 cells to
vincristine and paclitaxel but not to doxorubicin (Figure
5, Suppl. Table 8). The known ABCB1 inhibitor verapamil
sensitized UKF-NB-3rDOX20, UKF-NB-3rPCL10, and
UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells to all three drugs although it
exerted much more pronounced effects on vincristine and
paclitaxel than on doxorubicin (Figure 5, Suppl. Table 8).
Both LP117 and verapamil induced ABCB1-ATPase
activity in isolated membranes (Figure 6A). However,
only verapamil but not LP117 caused accumulation of the

fluorescent ABCB1 substrate rhodamine 123 in UKF-NB3rVCR10 cells in the investigated concentrations between
2 and 10μM (Figure 6B; Suppl. Figure 1). Furthermore,
both compounds enhanced accumulation of the fluorescent
ABCB1 substrate calcein-AM in UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells
but only verapamil enhanced accumulation of JC-1,
another fluorescent ABCB1 substrate (Figure 6B).
The specific interaction with the ABCB1-mediated
efflux of a limited number of substrates appears to
be a common feature of the investigated pirinixic
acid derivatives since none of the other pirinixic acid
derivatives that sensitized UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells to
vincristine (HZ25, HZ37, HZ59, YS71, YS80) influenced
rhodamine 123 accumulation in UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells in
the investigated concentrations (Suppl. Table 9).

paclitaxel, and actinomycin D displayed similarities but
clearly differed from the profile of doxorubicin (Figure
7A). Moreover, LP117 and verapamil had displayed
differing effects on rhodamine 123 accumulation in
ABCB1-expressing cells. Verapamil caused rhodamine
123 accumulation in UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells, while
LP117 did not modify cellular rhodamine 123 levels in
the investigated concentrations of up to 10μM (Figure
6; Suppl. Figure 1). In accordance, the docking studies
indicated differences in the ABCB1 binding site interaction
profiles of LP117 and verapamil that may contribute to this
discrepancy (Figure 7B). These differences may also play
a role with regard to the disparities in the relative effects
on vincristine and paclitaxel efficacy that were observed
between LP117 and verapamil in the ABCB1-expressing
cell lines UKF-NB-3rDOX20, UKF-NB-3rPCL10, and
UKF-NB-3rVCR10 (Figure 5). LP117 displayed stronger
effects on vincristine activity than on paclitaxel activity
in all three cell lines. In contrast, verapamil exerted
similar effects on vincristine and paclitaxel in UKF-NB-

3rDOX20 cells, more pronounced effects on paclitaxel
than on vincristine in UKF-NB-3rPCL10 cells, and more
pronounced effects on vincristine than on paclitaxel
in UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells (Figure 5). Notably, these
cell line-dependent effects of verapamil on vincristine
and paclitaxel efficacy may point to differences in the
composition of the cell membrane that may influence
transporter activity [23]. In addition, discordances in
ABCB1 sequence and/ or structure between the cell lines
may contribute to this phenomenon.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we screened a panel of pirinixic
acid derivatives for effects on the viability of the
neuroblastoma cell line UKF-NB-3 and the prostate
carcinoma cell line PC-3. HZ53 (IC50 UKF-NB-3: 4.66 ±
1.85, IC50 PC-3: 10.76 ± 0.23), LP123 (IC50 UKF-NB-3:
2.04 ± 0.69, IC50 PC-3: 58.23 ± 17.65), and YS80 (IC50

10μM in at least one of the cell lines. Further research
will have to show whether some of these compounds
may exert promising anti-cancer activity in a broader
range of models.

The investigated pirinixic acid derivatives modulate
5-LO, mPGES1, PPARα, and PPARγ at varying potencies
[3–8] and these molecules are considered as potential
anti-cancer drug targets [14–17]. However, the effects of
the compounds on cancer cell viability did not correlate

these molecules is not critical for their anti-cancer activity

characterized by varying activity profiles in a set of

drug-resistant neuroblastoma cell lines consisting of the

similarly effective to UKF-NB-3 in all resistant cell lines

but UKF-NB-3rDOX20, while UKF-NB-3rDOX20 and
Be(2)-C cells were resistant to LP117. These findings
suggest that the investigated pirinixic acid derivatives
differ in the mechanisms underlying their effects on cancer
cell viability.

with LP117 being the most potent one. LP117 also
sensitized a range of further ABCB1-expressing cell lines
to vincristine, including two other neuroblastoma cell lines
with acquired resistance to vincristine (IMR-32rVCR10,
UKF-NB-2rVCR10), UKF-NB-3 sub-lines adapted to
doxorubicin (UKF-NB-3rDOX20) or paclitaxel (UKFNB-3rPCL10), and the intrinsically ABCB1-expressing
neuroblastoma cell line UKF-NB-4 [20,22,24] but did not
sensitize UKF-NB-3rDOX20 or UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells to
the non-ABCB1 substrate cisplatin. These data, together
with the finding that LP117 stimulates ABCB1 ATPase
activity, suggest that LP117 and other pirinixic derivatives
interfere with ABCB1 function, possibly being substrates.
Most strikingly, LP117 sensitized ABCB1expressing cells to ABCB1 substrates including
vincristine, vinorelbine, actinomycin D, and paclitaxel but
not to doxorubicin. Among the three fluorescent ABCB1
substrates, LP117 only caused cellular accumulation
of calcein-AM but not of rhodamine 123 or JC-1 in the
investigated concentration range. This suggests that
LP117 interferes with ABCB1-mediated drug transport
in a substrate-specific fashion. Such a substrate-specific
interaction with ABCB1 function appears to be a common
feature of the investigated pirinixic acid derivatives since
HZ25, HZ37, HZ59, YS71, and YS80 all sensitized
ABCB1-expressing cells to vincristine but did not cause
rhodamine 123 accumulation in ABCB1-expressing cells.
Verapamil also displayed stronger effects on the sensitivity
of ABCB1-expressing cells to vincristine and paclitaxel
than to doxorubicin. Indeed, in silico docking studies
indicated a notable difference in the interaction profile of
doxorubicin with known ABCB1 binding sites compared
to vincristine, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, and actinomycin
D that may contribute to the discrepancies observed.
LP117 and verapamil differed in their interactions with
rhodamine 123. Only verapamil caused rhodamine 123
accumulation in ABCB1-expressing cells in the tested
concentration range of up to 10μM. In accordance, in
silico docking studies revealed recognizable disparities in
the ABCB1 binding site interaction profiles of LP117 and
verapamil.
Our data shed further light on the complexity of
substrate interactions with ABCB1 adding to previous
reports that had suggested that the mode and/or strength of
ABCB1 interaction may differ among ABCB1 substrates
[25–30]. Notably, the composition of the cell membrane
and ABCB1 polymorphisms/ mutations are also known
to modulate ABCB1 function and substrate specificity
[23;31]. In this context, we here showed that the relative
effects of verapamil on paclitaxel and vincristine toxicity
differed between the ABCB1-expressing cell lines UKFNB-3rDOX20 (doxorubicin-resistant), UKF-NB-3rPCL10
(paclitaxel-resistant), and UKF-NB-3rVCR10 (vincristineresistant). Verapamil sensitized UKF-NB-3rDOX20 cells to
paclitaxel and vincristine in a similar fashion but displayed
more pronounced effects on paclitaxel in UKF-NBwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

3rPCL10 cells and more pronounced effects on vincristine
in UKF-NB-3rVCR10 cells. This may indicate that cancer
cell adaptation to ABCB1 substrates may not only result
in increased ABCB1 expression but potentially also to
further changes that increase the specificity of ABCB1 to
certain substrates.
More
targeted
approaches
combining
pharmacologically active ABCB1 substrates with
tailored ABCB1 inhibitors would offer novel therapeutic
opportunities. High ABCB1 levels represent an important
cancer cell resistance mechanism [32–34]. However,
ABCB1 inhibitors failed in a number of clinical cancer
trials [32,33]. One of the reasons for these failures is
that ABCB1 inhibitors did not only interfere with the
ABCB1 present on cancer cells but also with ABCB1 at
physiological cellular and tissue barriers. Thus, ABCB1
inhibitors affected the adsorption and distribution
of concomitantly administered drugs (and possibly
xenobiotics) resulting in toxicity and unpredictable
pharmacokinetics [32,33]. Tailored combinations of drugs
that are ABCB1 substrates and respective drug-specific
ABCB1 inhibitors may help to overcome this problem. In
addition, such specific ABCB1 substrate/ ABCB1 inhibitor
combinations may also improve the oral bioavailability of
drugs and drug penetration into the central nervous system
[32,33].
In conclusion, we provide evidence that pirinixic
acid derivatives interfere with ABCB1-mediated drug
transport in a substrate-specific manner.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs
The structures of the investigated compounds
are shown in Suppl. Table 121. The compounds were
synthesized as previously described [3–8].

Cells
The prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3 was obtained
from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany) and the MYCNamplified neuroblastoma cell lines Be(2)-C and IMR32 from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). The alveolar
rhabdomyosarcoma cell line Rh30 was kindly provided
by Dr. P.J. Houghton (St. Jude’s Children’s Research
Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee). The MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma cell lines UKF-NB-2, UKF-NB-3, and
UKF-NB-4 were established from stage 4 neuroblastoma
patients [21,22,35].
The following drug-adapted cell lines were derived
from the resistant cancer cell line (RCCL) collection (http://
www.kent.ac.uk/stms/cmp/RCCL/RCCLabout.html): IMR32rVCR10 (vincristine), UKF-NB-2rVCR10, UKF-NB3rCDDP1000 (cisplatin), UKF-NB-3rDOX20 (doxorubicin),
UKF-NB-3rPCL10
(paclitaxel),
UKF-NB-3rVCR10,

Rh30rVCR10. Parental chemosensitive cell lines had been
adapted to growth in the presence of anti-cancer drugs by
continuous exposure to increasing drug concentrations as
described previously [21,35,36].
All cells were propagated at 37°C in IMDM
supplemented with 10 % FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and
100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were routinely tested for
mycoplasma contamination and authenticated by short
tandem repeat profiling.

the co-crystallized ligand (QZ-Val) at the three respective
locations in the co-crystallized structure. This exercise
resulted in very low Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD)
values between the docked and the co-crystallized
structures (RMSD < 1Å), which indicates the ability of
achieving a near-native ligand pose. All the compounds
used in the cell sensitization experiments were docked
into the binding sites of the Abcb1 structure. All ligands
were minimized using self-consistent field (SCF) method
with PM6 Hamiltonian for partial charge assignment. The
compounds were then docked at several different binding
sites suggested by the literature for substrate or ATP
binding. This included the M-site, R-site, H-site, elbow
helix-2, verapamil, and the ATP 1 and ATP 2 binding
sites. The amino acid residues defining these binding sites
are presented in Suppl. Table 13 and their positions are
shown in Suppl. Figure 2. A flexible docking protocol
was used where the amino acid residues in the binding
site were allowed a constrained movement. After this
flexible docking the top 60 London dG scoring poses were
kept, then re-docked and re-scored using GBVI/WSA dG
scoring in MOE and the top pose was used in the analysis.

Viability assay
Cell
viability
was
tested
by
the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) dye reduction assay after 120 h incubation
modified as previously described [21,24,35,36]].

Determination of ABCB1 ATPase activity
The ABCB1-ATPase activity was determined using
membrane preparations (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg,
Germany) and an established kit (BD Biosciences,
Heidelberg, Germany) following the manufacturer’s
instruction.

Statistics

Flow cytometry

Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. of at least
three experiments. Comparisons between two groups were
performed using Student’s t-test. Three and more groups
were compared by ANOVA followed by the StudentNewman-Keuls test. P values lower than 0.05 were
considered to be significant.

The ABCB1-mediated efflux of fluorescent ABCB1
substrates was determined as described previously [20].
Cells were incubated with rhodamine 123 (0.5μM), JC-1
(0.1μM), or calcein-AM (1μM) for 60 min. Then cells
were washed with PBS and incubated for another 60 min
to allow ABCB1-mediated drug efflux. Subsequently,
cellular fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry
(FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany).
Rhodamine 123 was detected at the FL1 channel. JC-1 and
calcein-AM were detected at the FL2 channel.

GRANT SUPPORT

Docking experiments

The work was supported by the Hilfe für
krebskranke Kinder Frankfurt e.V., the Frankfurter
Stiftung für krebskranke Kinder, and the Kent Cancer
Trust.

Molecular docking experiments were performed
using the most recently solved crystal structure of murine
holo Abcb1 (PDB code: 4Q9J), the holo structure with
the highest resolution to date (3.6 Å), complexed with
three cyclic peptide structures (QZ-Val), one of which
is located at a possibly new binding site at the elbow
helix-2 region [37]. All docking was carried out using
MOE (version 2013.08, Chemical Computing Group
Inc., Montreal, Canada). The protein structure provided
in the PDB file was edited using the Protonate3D
protocol in MOE which consisted of capping termini
and chain breaks, and protonation and charge correction
using AMBER99 for charge assignment. The structure
was minimized using the ligX protocol under “tethered”
conditions to avoid any considerable displacements from
the original crystal structure. The optimized structure was
used first to validate our docking protocol by re-docking
