ABSTRACT
Dysregulation of miRNAs is involved in osteosarcoma (OS). Here, we demonstrate
that miR-382 is decreased in specimens of OS patients with a poor chemoresponse
compared to those with a good chemoresponse. In addition, our clinical data show that
decreased miR-382 was associated with poor survival in OS patients. Overexpression
of miR-382 inhibited cell growth and chemoresistance by targeting KLF12 and HIPK3,
respectively. In contrast, inhibition of miR-382 or overexpression of target genes
stimulated OS cell growth and chemoresistance both in vitro and in vivo. Taken
together, these findings suggest that miR-382 is a tumor suppressor miRNA and
induction of miR-382 is a potential strategy to inhibit OS progression.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA
molecules of 18–22 nucleotides in length that regulate
gene expression at the posttranscriptional level through
interaction with complementary sequences in the 3’-UTRs
of target mRNAs [6]. Differential miRNA expression
between tumors and normal tissue has been described
for many tumor types [2, 7], suggesting that miRNAs
play an important role in tumorigenesis and disease
progression. Indeed, recent studies show that aberrantly
regulated miRNAs cause tumor initiation, development,
metastasis and therapeutic resistance in many cancers
by regulating multiple target genes [8, 9]. Studies also
show that miRNA expression is dysregulated in OS tissue
compared to normal bone. However, in contrast to other
cancer types, little is known about the role of miRNAs in
the pathogenesis of OS and regulation of abnormal gene
expression [2, 10]. Recently, two studies reported that
miR-382 levels were decreased in OS tissue or cell lines
compared to normal bone [2, 11], suggesting that miR382 may function as an onco-miRNA in OS. However,
the effects on and molecular mechanism of miR-382 in

INTRODUCTION
Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary
malignant tumor in children and adolescents [1]. The
standard of care for appendicular OS in children leads
to an overall 5-year survival rate of approximately 70%
[2]. However, 30% of children diagnosed with OS will
not survive for more than five years, and fewer than
50% will live beyond 10 years [3, 4]. A comprehensive
understanding of OS biology is required to optimize
treatment strategies and develop new chemotherapeutic
agents [2]. Because treatment of this disease often fails
due to chemoresistance development [5], it is especially
important to analyze the molecular mechanisms that
underlie this resistance. Such analyses could potentially
lead to the development of novel treatment strategies for
OS. The molecular basis of OS has received considerable
attention during the past decade, and potential therapeutic
targets are being identified. However, the cellular
mechanisms that lead to the development of osteosarcoma
and chemoresistance remain unclear.

OS are still unclear. Thus, we investigated the role and
mechanism of miR-382 in OS.

miR-382 function in OS progression. Similar with previous
report, our data also show that the expression of miR-382
was significantly decreased in OS cell lines and OS tissues
compared to human fetal osteoblastic cells (hFOB) and
normal bones (Figures 1B and C). Furthermore, our clinical
results show that expression of miR-382 was inversely
correlated with OS patient survival (Figure 1D). These
results suggest that miR-382 may be plays an important
role in OS development and chemoresistance.

RESULTS
Expression level of miR-382 in OS tissue closely
correlated with clinical outcomes
Previous study show that several members of the
14q32 locus miRNAs including miR-382, miR-134,
and miR-544 were inversely correlated with OS patients
clinical outcomes [12]. However, our data show only
miR-382 expression was significantly decreased
in specimens from OS patients that showed a poor
chemoresponse compared to those that responded well to
chemotherapy (Figure 1A). So, in this study, we focused on

Next, we investigated the effects of miR-382
on OS cell growth by overexpression or inhibition of
miR-382 (Supplementary Figure S1). As shown in

inhibited U2OS cell growth. In contrast, inhibition of
miR-382 stimulated U2OS cell growth (Figure 2A). We
further confirmed these results with a clonogenic assay
using another OS cell line, MG63. Overexpression of
miR-382 inhibited MG63 colony formation, whereas
inhibition of miR-382 stimulated MG63 colony

formation compared to the control (Figure 2B). These
results parallel those obtained from MTT assays
performed on U2OS cells. Finally, we confirmed these

Decreased expression of miR-382 contributes to
chemoresistance in OS

data show that overexpression of miR-382 enhanced
CDDP-induced cell apoptosis, whereas inhibition of
miR-382 significantly reduced the number of apoptotic
cells induced by CDDP (Figure 3B). Consistent with these
data, Western blotting data also show that expression or
knockdown of miR-382 increased or decreased CDDPinduced cleavage of caspase 3, respectively (Figure 3C).
In addition, we examined the effect of miR-382 on OS cell
chemosensitivity to doxorubicin and MTX. As with the
CDDP experiment, overexpression of miR-382 increased
doxorubicin- or MTX-induced cell death by increasing
apoptosis, whereas silencing of miR-382 protected cells
from these drugs (Supplementary Figure S2). Finally, our
clinical data show that patients with high miR-382 more
sensitive to chemotherapy compared to patients with low
miR-382 (Figure 3D).

As shown above, miR-382 was significantly
decreased in specimens of OS patients that had a poor
chemoresponse compared to those that responded well
to chemotherapy, suggesting that miR-382 may be
involved in OS chemoresistance. Thus, we examined
the effects of miR-382 on chemotherapeutic sensitivity
in OS using CDDP, doxorubicin, and MTX because
these three drugs are commonly used anticancer drugs
in OS[13]. As expected, inhibition of miR-382 protected
cells from CDDP-induced death in U2OS cells, whereas
overexpression of miR-382 increased cell death induced by
CDDP (Figure 3A). These results were further confirmed
in MG63 cells by flow cytometric analysis. The  flow

from three independent experiments. (C) Overexpression of miR-382 increased CDDP-induced caspase 3 cleavage, whereas inhibition of

mutation was inserted in the KLF12 or HIPK3 3’ UTR,
as indicated in Figure 4A. The results show that miR382 overexpression significantly repressed luciferase
activity in the wild-type 3’ UTR treatment. In contrast,
both 3’ UTR alterations completely abrogated the effect
of miR-382 overexpression on luciferase expression in
HEK293T cells (Figure 4C). In addition, we observed an
inverse correlation between the expression of miR-382
and KLF12 or HIPK3 in OS patients (Figure 4D). Taken
together, these data suggest that miR-382 negatively
regulates the expression of KLF12 and HIPK3 by

gene expression regulation. Here, we found that
KLF12 and HIPK3 were tentative targets of miR382 (Figure 4A). As shown in Figure 4B, KLF12 and
HIPK3 expression were significantly decreased by
ectopic over expression of miR-382 at both the mRNA
and protein level. In contrast, inhibition of miR-382
increased the expression of KLF12 and HIPK3 at both
the mRNA and protein level. To determine whether the

results in an MNNG/HOS xenograft model. The in vivo
results parallel the in vitro results and show that KLF12
and HIPK3 overexpression stimulate tumor growth and
chemoresistance, respectively (Figures 5C and D).

To determine whether the anti-tumor effects of
miR-382 on these OS cells could be partly explained by
its targeting of KLF12 and HIPK3, we first analyzed how
KLF12 and HIPK3 overexpression affected in vitro and
in vivo cell growth and chemosensitivity. Our data show
that the overexpression of HIPK3 protected MG63 cells
from CDDP-induced death. Overexpression of KLF12
did not have effect (Figure 5A). However, KLF 12
overexpression significantly stimulated MG63 cell growth
compared to the vector control and HIPK3 overexpression

As presented above, miR-382 can modulate the cell
growth-related gene KLF12 and the chemosensitivityrelated gene HIPK3. Hence, we sought to determine
whether the anti-tumor phenotype associated with

protected cells from death induced by CDDP treatment. KLF12 overexpression did not have this effect. MG63 cells were transfected with

miR-382 overexpression could be rescued by KLF12 or
HIPK3 overexpression in miR-382-overexpressing cells.
For this purpose, an expression of KLF12 or HIPK3
construct lacking its respective 3’ UTR was transiently
transfected into cells that stably overexpress miR-382
(MNNG/HOS) (Supplementary Figures S3A and B). As
shown in Figures 6A and B, overexpression of KLF12
and HIPK3 significantly stimulated tumor growth and

chemoresistance in miR-382-overexpressing MNNG/
HOS cell xenograft models, respectively. In contrast,
knockdown of KLF12 and HIPK3 respectively inhibited
tumor growth and enhanced chemosensitivity in a miR382-knockdown MNNG/HOS cell xenograft model
(Figures 6C and D). In conclusion, these experiments first
provided that KLF12 and HIPK3 are major functional
downstream players of miR-382 in OS.

The prognostic significance of miR-382 for
survival is due to the potential effect on
chemoresistance

targeting of cMyc [22]. Taken together, these data suggest
that miR-382 suppresses OS tumors.
Although significant advances have been made
in the treatment of OS, chemoresistance constitutes a
persistent problem in the treatment of this disease. CDDP,
doxorubicin, and MTX are commonly used anticancer
drugs in OS [13]. Patients who do not respond to these
drugs have a poor prognosis [5]. However, the mechanism
of chemoresistance in OS is still unclear. Our data present
the first evidence that miR-382 is markedly downregulated
in tumors of OS patients that have a poor chemoresponse
compared to those that respond well to chemotherapy.
Furthermore, we have found that experimental restoration
of miR-382 expression in OS cells leads to enhanced
chemosensitivity to anti-cancer drugs, whereas complete
inhibition of miR-382 promoted chemoresistance. In
addition, our in vivo data show that concomitant miR382 inhibition and target gene knockdown increases
chemosensitivity. This effect was not observed when
the target genes lacked their 3’ UTR sequences. Taken
together, these findings suggest that miR-382 and
its downstream target genes play important roles in
controlling OS chemosensitivity.
As described above, miRNAs play different roles
by targeting different genes. Thus, investigating the target
genes remains important to understand the molecular
mechanisms by which a miRNA promotes or suppresses
oncogenesis. In this study, we identified KLF12 and HIKP3
as miR-382 target genes. Our data show that restoration
of miR-382 expression in OS cells leads to suppression
of KLF12 and HIKP3, whereas inhibition of miR-382
further upregulates KLF12 and HIKP3. Our luciferase
reporter experiments show that miR-382 directly targets
the 3’ UTR of KLF12 and HIPK3. Furthermore, an inverse
correlation between the miR-382 and KLF12 or HIKP3
expression levels was demonstrated in human OS samples.
Nakamura et al. reported that KLF12 acts as an oncogene
and plays an important role in gastric cancer progression
by stimulating cancer cell growth [23]. In fact, increased
expression of KLF12 was also detected by microarray gene
profiling in OS tissue, but its role was unclear [24, 25].
Our data present the first evidence for KLF12’s strong
stimulation of OS cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We also
demonstrated that the expression of KLF12 was controlled
by miR-382. Importantly, overexpression of KLF12
increased tumor growth in a miR-382-overexpressing
MNNG/HOS xenograft model. Conversely, knockdown of
KLF-12 inhibited tumor growth in a miR-382-knockdown
MNNG/HOS xenograft model. These data suggest that
downregulation of miR-382 can stimulate cancer growth
by targeting KLF12 in OS. In this study, we also discovered
that HIPK3 is a target of miR-382. Previous studies
have shown that HIPK3 is implicated in the multidrug
resistance of a number of tumors [26-28]. Consistent
with these reports, our data also show that overexpression

We next analyzed factors predictive of poor
overall survival in OS patients using univariate and
multivariate Cox regression analysis (Supplementary
Table 2). In the univariate analysis, poor survival in
OS patients was associated with miR-382 expression
level and chemoresistance. In multivariate analysis,
the chemoresponse is still significantly associated
with survival (p=0.02), however, we did not observed
significant correlation between the miR-382 expression
level and survival (p=0.07). In addition, above data show
that miR-382 significantly affects chemoresponse in OS,
suggesting that miR-382 effects on OS patients may be
due to affect chemoresistance. So, we next performed
Spearman correlation analysis. As expected, our clinical
data show that the expression of miR-382 is significantly
correlated to chemoresponse in OS patients (p=0.01,
correlation coefficient = - 0.24).

DISCUSSION
Our knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of
OS has increased tremendously during the past decade.
However, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular
mechanisms of the disease, such as its tumorigenesis,
specific mediators of disease progression, occurrence of
chemoresistance, and development of metastasis [14],
remains elusive. Recent studies have shown that
dysregulated miRNAs significantly contribute to all
stages of OS progression by regulating their target genes
[15, 16]. Interestingly, individual miRNAs may have
dual functions in tumor progression as either a tumor
promoter or suppressor [17-19]. Accordingly, several
studies suggest that miR-382 may also play dual role in
different cancer types. Significantly increased expression
of miR-382 was identified in multiple myeloma [20] and
acute myeloid leukemia with common translocations [21],
and the authors indicated that increased miR-382 may
contribute to the development of these diseases. However,
in current study, we provide evidence that miR-382 acts
as a cancer suppressor in OS. Importantly, inhibition of
miR-382 or overexpression of its target genes in OS cells
enables them develop chemoresistance and proliferate.
Conversely, miR-382 overexpression or concomitant
miR-382 silencing and target gene knockdown impairs
the establishment of an aggressive phenotype, suggesting
a major role for miR-382 and its downstream target
genes in controlling OS progression. In agreement with
our findings, Thayanithy et al. reported decreased miR382 levels in OS cell lines compared to normal bone and
an anticancer effect on OS cells by miR-382 through the

of HIPK3 induces CDDP resistance in vitro and in vivo.
More importantly, overexpression of HIPK3 induced
chemoresistance in miR-382-overexpressing OS cells,
whereas knockdown of HIPK3 improved chemosensitivity
to CDDP in miR-382-knockdown OS cells. These data
suggest that decreased miR-382 contributes to OS growth
and chemoresistance by targeting the KLF12 and HIPK3
genes, respectively.
In this study, we identified a significantly
decreased expression level of miR-382 in OS cells and
patient tumor samples. In addition, our results show that
the decreased expression of miR-382 closely correlated
with poor chemosensitivity and poor survival in OS
patients. In agreement with our findings, Sarver et al.
also demonstrated an inverse correlation between the
miR-382 expression level and positive clinical outcomes
using small-scale human OS samples, suggesting that
miR-382 may be a useful prognostic and predictive
marker candidate that can assist in the management of
patients with OS. However, our multivariable analysis
results show that miR-382 unlike chemoresistance no
correlation with poor survival in OS patients. These
data suggesting that the prognostic significance of miR382 for survival may be due to the potential effect on
chemoresistance. In fact, clinical data show that the
expression level of miR-382 is significantly correlated
to chemoresponse in OS patients.
The survival of patient with OS has markedly
improved from less than 20% reported in the 1960s
[29-31] to approximately 65-70% in the 1970s [32].
However, the survival of OS patients has remained
unchanged over the past 30 years. Treatment of OS often
fails due to chemoresistance development. Recent studies
show that chemoresistance in OS appears to be mediated
by numerous mechanisms including perturbations
in signal transduction pathways and microRNA
(miRNA) dysregulation [33]. In addition, studies show
targeting these essential pathways in combination with
conventional therapy could be a strategy to improve the
efficacy of current drug regimens in OS [34-36]. In this
study, our data show overexpression of miR-382 or
knock down of target genes can significantly inhibits OS
cell growth and chemoresistance both in vitro and in vivo.
Taken together, these findings suggest that induction
of miR-382 is a potential strategy to overcome drug
resistance in OS.
In summary, we combined clinical and
experimental studies to establish a role for miR-382
in OS. Our work led to the identification of a novel
functional pathway controlled by miR-382 and its
direct targets, KLF12 and HIPK3, that coordinate
tumor growth and chemosensitivity, respectively, in
OS. Therefore, miR-382 and its target gene pathway
may represent new therapeutic opportunities for
chemoresistant OS.

non-fat milk) for 3 hrs at RT.

After 6 hrs of transfection, cells were seeded in
6-well cell culture plates. Cells were incubated with
indicated drugs. 24 hrs later, cells were harvested, then,
stained with annexin V and 7-aminoactinomycin D
(7-AAD) according to the manufacturer’s protocol,
followed by flow cytometric analysis.

Real-time quantitative PCR analysis
For the qRT-PCR analysis, the total RNA was
isolated from OS cells or human specimens using
the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. For miR-382 and RNU6B,
reverse transcription and real-time PCR were performed
with The TaqMan MicroRNA reverse transcription kit and
TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, respectively, using
Ambion miRNA primers. miRNAs expression level was
normalized to RNU6B.
For other gene expression, reverse transcription and
PCR were performed with a High Capacity cDNA Reverse
Transcription Kit (Life technologies) and QuantiTect
SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen), respectively. The primer
sequences for genes were defined as follows: KLF12
forward 5’-CACCTGGAAATG TGAACAACA-3’, reverse
5’-TTTTACTTTGTCTGGGAGATAGGC-3’;
HIPK3
forward 5’-ACATTGGAAGAGCATGAGGCAGAGA-3’,
reverse 5’-CTGCTG AAAAGCATCACCACAACCA-3’;
GAPDH forward 5’-GCAGGGGGGAGCCAAAA GGGT-3’
and reverse 5’-TGGGTGGCAGTGATGGCATGG-3’.

Stable cell line selection
MNNG/HOS cells were transfected with miR-382
expression vector or antisense-miR-382 expression vector.
After 36 hrs of transfection, cells were incubated with
2µg/ml puromycin. The expression of miR-382 was
measured after 7 days of treatment with puromycin and
frozen down in aliquots for later use.

Animal experiments
To investigate the effects of the indicated genes in
tumor growth, MNNG/HOS cells were transfected with
a corresponding plasmid. After 36 hrs of transfection,
2 × 106 cells in serum-free medium were injected s.c. into
six-week old female athymic (nu/nu) mice (n = 8/group).
The mice were sacrificed 1 month after cell injection, and
the tumor weights were measured.
For the chemotherapy experiment, MNNG/HOS
or stable MNNG/HOS (overexpressing miR-382 or

9481

Oncotarget

knockdown miR-382) were transfected with the indicated
plasmid. After 36 hrs of transfection, 2 × 106 cells in
serum-free medium were injected s.c. into six-week old
female athymic (nu/nu) mice (n = 8/group). When tumors
reached a size of approximately 100 mm3, the mice were
started on a treatment of either PBS or CDDP (10 mg/Kg
body weight). The treatment was administered every
third day. After 3 weeks. The mice were sacrificed and the
tumor weights were measured.

Statistic analysis
The survival rate of OS patients was calculated
using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Differences
between groups were determined by an unpaired Student’s
t-test or one-way ANOVA method using the SAS
statistical software package version 6.12 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC). A p-value less than to 0.05 was considered to
be statistically significant.
