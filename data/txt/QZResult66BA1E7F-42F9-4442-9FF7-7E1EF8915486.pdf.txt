Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cyclin D1 is a component of the core cell cycle machinery1. Abnormally high levels of cyclin D1
are detected in many human cancer types2. To elucidate the molecular functions of cyclin D1 in
human cancers, here we performed a proteomic screen for cyclin D1 protein partners in several
types of human tumors. Analyses of cyclin D1-interactors revealed a network of DNA repair
proteins, including RAD51, a recombinase that drives the homologous recombination process3.
We found that cyclin D1 directly binds RAD51, and that cyclin D1-RAD51 interaction is induced
by radiation. Like RAD51, cyclin D1 is recruited to DNA damage sites in a BRCA2-dependent
fashion. Reduction of cyclin D1 levels in human cancer cells impaired recruitment of RAD51 to
damaged DNA, impeded the homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair, and increased
sensitivity of cells to radiation in vitro and in vivo. This effect was seen in cancer cells lacking the
retinoblastoma protein, which do not require D-cyclins for proliferation4, 5. These findings reveal
an unexpected function of a core cell cycle protein in DNA repair and suggest that targeting cyclin

D1 may be beneficial also in retinoblastoma-negative cancers which are currently thought to be
oblivious to cyclin D1 inhibition.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to elucidate the molecular functions of cyclin D1 in human cancer cells, we set to
identify cyclin D1-interacting proteins in four types of human tumors: mantle cell
lymphoma (Granta 519 cells), breast cancer (MCF7 and ZR-75-1), squamous cell carcinoma
(UMSCC-2), and colorectal cancer (HT-29). These cell lines overexpress cyclin D1 due to
amplification or rearrangements within the cyclin D1 gene, or mutations within the cyclin
D1 degradation machinery6–9. Cyclin D1-containing complexes were purified using double
immunoaffinity purification10 (Supplementary Fig. 1), and the identity of cyclin D1interactors was determined by rounds of liquid chromatography and high-throughput mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A total of 132 proteins were identified with high confidence
(Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Tables 1–5).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We constructed a biological process/molecular function enrichment heatmap of cyclin D1interactors (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 6), and searched for common functions.
Unexpectedly, apart from cell cycle control proteins, we observed DNA repair category
amongst the most enriched functions (Fig. 1b Supplementary Fig. 3a and Supplementary
Table 6). Using published databases of physical and functional interactions, we constructed
a protein interaction network of all cyclin D1-interactors encountered by us, and observed a
cluster of DNA repair proteins centered on RAD51, a key DNA recombinase mediating
DNA repair via homologous recombination (HR)3 (Supplementary Fig. 3b). These
observations suggested that cyclin D1 may play a role in DNA damage repair.
Consistent with this possibility, we found that depletion of cyclin D1 by short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) in cervical carcinoma HeLa and lung cancer H2009 cells, significantly increased
the sensitivity of cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR) (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Fig. 4a, c).
We utilized these two retinoblastoma protein (pRB)-negative cell lines to rule out cell cycle
effects of cyclin D1 knock-down, as pRB-negative cancer cells do not require D-cyclins for
proliferation4, 5 (Supplementary Fig. 5). Reduction of cyclin D1 levels also sensitized cancer
cells to DNA-damaging drugs camptothecin and etoposide (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 4d).
Moreover, fibroblasts lacking D-cyclins (D1−/−D2−/−D3−/−)11, which have normal cell
cycle progression, showed increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation; re-expression of cyclin
D1 in these cells restored radiation sensitivity (Supplementary Figs. 4e–f, 6).

Cyclin D1 activates cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK61. However, treatment of
HeLa cells with PD0332991, a specific inhibitor of cyclin D-CDK4/6 kinase12, had no effect
on sensitivity of cancer cells to IR (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Moreover, expression of cyclin
D1K112E point-mutant which is unable to activate the CDKs13, 14, restored radiation
susceptibility in cyclin D-null MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 6). Collectively, these
observations suggested that cyclin D1 might play a kinase-independent function in DNA
repair.
We used comet assay15 to directly assess the efficiency of DNA repair in cyclin D1-depleted
cells. We found that radiation induced comparable levels of DNA damage in control and in
cyclin D1-depleted cells (Fig. 2c, 4hrs, Supplementary Fig. 7a). However, at 16 hours postradiation, more unrepaired DNA persisted in cyclin D1-depleted cells (Fig. 2c,
Supplementary Fig. 7). We verified that this impaired rate of DNA repair was not a result of
grossly compromised DNA damage-induced signaling (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b).
Since among cyclin D1-interactors we observed a network of DNA repair proteins including
RAD51, a key DNA recombinase that drives the HR process3, 16 (Supplementary Fig. 1), we
investigated a possible functional connection between cyclin D1 and HR-dependent DNA

repair. Using a HR repair reporter, the DR-eGFP system17, we found that depletion of cyclin
D1 in HeLa and H2009 cells significantly reduced the HR rate (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig.
9). As expected, re-expression of siRNA-resistant cyclin D1 rescued this effect
(Supplementary Fig. 10a–c). These results suggested that cyclin D1 is required for an
efficient HR DNA repair process. Consistent with this notion, cyclin D1-depletion sensitized
cancer cells to treatment with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-inhibitor (Fig. 2e), in
concordance with the reports that deficiency in HR renders cells hypersensitive to these
agents18.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate a function of cyclin D1 in HR, we focused on cyclin D1 interaction with
RAD51, detected in our screen. We established using purified, recombinant proteins that
cyclin D1 directly binds to RAD51, and that N-terminus of cyclin D1 and C-terminus of
RAD51 mediate the interaction (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 11). Expression of cyclin D1
mutant which is deficient in RAD51 binding failed to restore normal HR rate in cyclin D1depleted cells (Supplementary Fig. 10d). We also verified physical binding of the
endogenous cyclin D1 and RAD51 proteins in several human cancer cell lines (Fig. 3b,
Supplementary Fig. 12a). The interaction between cyclin D1 and RAD51 was induced by
radiation and it intensified with the increased IR dose (Fig 3c, upper panel, Supplementary
Fig. 12b, c). As reported, radiation resulted in a decrease of total levels of cyclin D1, without
major changes in RAD51 levels19, 20 (Fig. 3c, lower panel, Supplementary Fig. 12c). The
strong induction of cyclin D1-RAD51 interaction after radiation, in the face of reduced total
cyclin D1 levels, indicates that an increased number of remaining cyclin D1 molecules is
recruited to RAD51 complex to facilitate a DNA repair process. In pRB-positive cancer
cells, decrease of total cyclin D1 levels upon radiation contributes to cell cycle arrest of
these cells19. Conversely, forced overexpression of cyclin D1 may overcome cell cycle
checkpoints, and may lead to unscheduled DNA synthesis and apoptosis20,21. Our results
reveal that after radiation the remaining pool of cyclin D1 plays a positive role in DNA
repair.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate whether cyclin D1 is recruited to the sites of damaged DNA, where RAD51
localizes after radiation, we utilized a system in which a unique I-SceI recognition site has
been integrated into the genome of HeLa cells17. Using this system, one can monitor
recruitment of repair proteins to the site of DNA damage using targeted chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP), followed by PCR with primers adjacent to DNA damage
site22–24. As expected, we observed recruitment of RAD51 to the DNA damage site (Fig. 3d
and Supplementary Fig. 13a, d, e). Importantly, targeted anti-cyclin D1 ChIP revealed that
cyclin D1 was also recruited to the site of DNA damage (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 13f);
this recruitment disappeared once cyclin D1 had been knocked-down (Supplementary Fig.
13b,g). Moreover, ChIP of cyclin D1 followed by re-ChIP with anti-RAD51 antibody
revealed that cyclin D1 and RAD51 co-localize on the sites of double-stranded DNA breaks
(Fig. 3f, Supplementary Fig. 13c). Cyclin D1 recruitment to the damaged DNA was also
detected by co-immunofluorescent staining with γ-H2AX at laser-induced DNA-damage
stripes (Supplementary Fig. 14).
To investigate how cyclin D1 facilitates the HR process, we studied recruitment of RAD51
to damaged DNA 25. We found that knock-down of cyclin D1 reduced recruitment of
RAD51 to I-SceI-induced DNA breaks (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 13a), to laser-induced
DNA-damage stripes (Supplementary Fig. 15), and to radiation-induced DNA damage foci
(Fig. 3g, Supplementary Figs 16, 17). We verified that the overall levels of RAD51 and of
several other DNA damage-response proteins were not affected by cyclin D1 knock-down
(Supplementary Fig. 8c). Collectively, these findings indicate that cyclin D1 helps to recruit
RAD51 to DNA damage sites through a direct cyclin D1-RAD51 physical interaction.

We next asked how cyclin D1 is recruited to sites of DNA damage. Among cyclin D1interactors we observed BRCA2 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Tables 1–
5), an essential HR protein which is recruited to DNA damage sites prior to RAD5125. We
established using purified recombinant cyclin D1 protein and BRCA2 protein fragments 26
that cyclin D1 directly interacts with BRCA2 (Fig. 3h), and we verified physical interaction
of the endogenous proteins (Fig. 3i). Importantly, we found that knock-down of BRCA2
reduced recruitment of cyclin D1 to DNA damage sites (Fig. 3j, Supplementary Fig. 18a).
Depletion of cyclin D1 had no observable effect on BRCA2 recruitment (Supplementary
Fig. 19a), consistent with the notion that BRCA2 acts upstream of cyclin D1. Likewise,
depletion of cyclin D1 had no detectable impact on other upstream events, such as DNA
end-resection (Supplementary Fig. 20a–d) and loading of a single-stranded DNA binding
protein RPA34 (Supplementary Fig. 20e, f). In contrast, depletion of cyclin D1 inhibited
downstream events, namely recruitment of RAD51, and led to decreased co-localization of
RAD51 on BRCA2 at DNA damage sites (Supplementary Fig. 18b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Collectively, these results are consistent with the model that cyclin D1 is recruited to DNA
damage sites through BRCA2; cyclin D1 then helps to recruit RAD51 through a direct
cyclin D1-RAD51 interaction. Depletion of cyclin D1 reduces RAD51 recruitment and
reduces RAD51-BRCA2 co-localization at DNA damage sites, leading to impaired HR rate.
Our findings are in agreement with a recent report that forced targeting of cyclin D1 to DNA
resulted in increased co-recruitment of RAD51 27.
We verified that cyclin D1 is not required for recruitment of other DNA damage proteins
detected as cyclin D1-interactors in our screen such as FANCD2, FANCI, PCNA and
MSH6, as well as BRCA1 and MRE11 (Supplementary Figs. 19,21). We also found that
depletion of cyclin D1 has no detectable impact on DNA mismatch repair rate
(Supplementary Fig. 22).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our observations suggested that depletion of cyclin D1 could sensitize human cancers to
radiation, by limiting DNA repair. To test this, we knocked-down cyclin D1 in three pRBnegative cancer cell lines: H2009, HeLa and in prostate cancer DU145. Cells were then
injected subcutaneously into nude mice, which resulted in formation of tumors. As expected,
depletion of cyclin D1 did not affect proliferation of cancer cells in vitro (Supplementary
Figs 5d and 23a–c, 24a–c), and had no impact on the rate of tumor growth in vivo (Fig. 4a,
b, Supplementary Figs. 24d–g, 25a). In contrast, upon irradiation, cyclin D1-depleted tumors
displayed retarded growth as compared to control tumors, revealing increased sensitivity to
ionizing radiation (Fig. 4a, b, Supplementary Figs 23d, e, 24d–g, 25b–e, 26–28 and data not
shown). Hence, while cyclin D1 is dispensable for proliferation of pRB-negative tumor
cells, it plays an important role in DNA repair, which becomes evident once cells undergo
DNA damage.
The cyclin D1 gene corresponds to the second most frequently amplified region within the
human cancer genome 28. Our proteomic screen revealed that cyclin D1 plays a function in
human cancer cells in DNA repair via the HR. Thus, targeting cyclin D1 in combination
with radiation treatment may have potential therapeutic value in a large pool of pRBnegative cancers.

METHODS SUMMARY
Affinity immunopurification and mass-spectrometry were as described 29. Comet assays
were according to manufacturer’s protocol (Trevigen). RAD51 and cyclin D1 ChIP were
performed using anti-RAD51 (H-92) or anti-cyclin D1 antibody (H-295, Santa Cruz). For
ChIP-re-ChIP, HA-tagged cyclin D1 was ChIP with anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Covance),

eluted with HA peptide, and re-ChIP with anti-RAD51 antibody. GST-proteins were
pGEX-5x-3 based (GE Healthcare). Cancer cells used for in vivo tumor study were
transduced with lentiviruses expressing anti-cyclin D1 or control shRNAs. 107 tumor cells
were injected subcutaneously into nu/nu mice. Tumors were target-irradiated using Cs137 as
a source. Tumor size was assessed on indicated days, tumor weight at the end of
experiments. Statistical significance of the differences was evaluated using paired two-tailed
Student’s t-test.

was followed by anti-RAD51 re-ChIP and PCR with primers adjacent to double-stranded
DNA break.
g, Reduction of RAD51 recruitment to DNA damage foci in HeLa cells depleted of cyclin
D1 (siD1-A, -C). Percentage of cells displaying a given number of RAD51 foci per nucleus
was determined before (0 h) and 8 hours after irradiation.
h, In vitro binding assays using the indicated GST-BRCA2 fragments26 and recombinant
cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 was detected by anti-cyclin D1 immunoblotting. Amounts of GSTBRCA2 fragments were verified by Ponceau staining (lower panel).
i, Interaction between endogenous cyclin D1 and BRCA2 (B2) in H2009 cells, detected by
immunoprecipitation–immunoblotting.
j, Recruitment of cyclin D1 to an I-SceI-induced double-stranded DNA break, tested as in e,
using cells transfected with independent anti-BRCA2 siRNAs (siBRCA2-A, and -B), or with
control siRNA (sicont), Bars show enrichment around DNA damage site.

Figure 4. Increased radiation-sensitivity of tumors with reduced cyclin D1 levels

a, H2009 cells expressing control or anti-cyclin D1 shRNA were injected into nude mice
and tumor growth was monitored on the indicated days. Left panel, mice received no
radiation. Middle and right panels: at days 5 and 10, tumors were exposed to 2 Gy or 4 Gy
of IR. Error bars, standard deviation; **, p ≤ 0.01; ***, p ≤ 0.005.
b, Weight of tumors at the end of observation period. Each circle represents an individual
tumor, horizontal bars - mean values. N, number of mice analyzed
