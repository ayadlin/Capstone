BACKGROUND. It is known that the uridine-diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase
1A1 (UGT1A1)*28 polymorphism reduces UGT1A1 enzyme activity, which may
lead to severe toxicities in patients who receive irinotecan. This study was conducted to assess the influence of this polymorphism on the efficacy and toxicity
of irinotecan treatment in Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma
(CRC).

METHODS. In total, 128 patients with metastatic CRC who had received previous
treatment with irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin were analyzed retrospectively. Genomic DNA samples were obtained from patients’ leukocytes, and genotypes were determined by analyzing the sequence of TATA boxes in the UGT1A1
gene. The influence of the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism on toxicity and treatment
outcome was analyzed.

RESULTS. Approximately 20% of patients were identified with the UGT1A1*28
polymorphism, including 15.6% (n 5 20 patients) with the thymine-adenine

remaining 79.7% of patients (n 5 102) had wild type TA6/TA6. Marked increases

(23.1% vs 8.8%; P 5 .04) were observed in patients who had the TA6/TA7 or TA7/
TA7 genotypes. Patients’ pretreatment bilirubin levels correlated well with irinotecan-induced neutropenia (P < .01). It was noted that, although the requirement
for irinotecan dose reduction was significantly greater in patients who had this
genetic variant (42.3% vs 12.7%; P < .01), it did not affect the response rate to irinotecan-based chemotherapy (42.3% vs 45.1%; P 5 .80), and it did not significantly affect progression-free survival (10 months vs 11 months; P 5 .94) or
overall survival (19 months vs 18 months; P 5 .84).
CONCLUSIONS. The current data suggested that the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism
may be a key determinant for predicting irinotecan-induced severe toxicities

treatments in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (CRC). In addition, the analysis of genomic
polymorphisms for predicting the efficacy and toxicity of treatment also may be helpful in identifying
the patients who may benefit from chemotherapy.1
For example, the functional polymorphisms of genes
involved in the targeting and metabolism of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)2–4 and DNA repair during platinumbased treatment5,6 can effectively predict the response and prognosis of patients with metastatic CRC
who are receiving 5-FU and oxaliplatin.
Irinotecan is a camptothecin analogue that has
been used widely in a variety of malignancies,
including CRC. By effectively inhibiting topoisomerase I, an enzyme that involves in DNA replication,
irinotecan may induce apoptosis of tumor cells.
Because irinotecan-based chemotherapy has been
considered standard treatment in the management
of metastatic CRC, interpatient variation of the
enzymes involved in the metabolism of irinotecan
has been investigated extensively.7–11 The metabolism of irinotecan is a complex process that involves
several enzymes. Initially, the ester bond of irinotecan is cleaved by carboxylesterases (CESs) to form an
active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin
(SN-38). Although SN-38 is much more active in inhibiting topoisomerase I than irinotecan,12 it has
been associated with more toxicities, especially
severe neutropenia and diarrhea.13 Later on, SN-38 is
conjugated with b-glucuronic acid by uridine-diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase (UGT) to form an inactive metabolite, SN-38G.14 Several factors, including
CES, UGT, cytochrome p450 isoforms, multidrug resistance-associated proteins ABCB1 and ABCC2, organic anion-transporting polypeptide SLCO1B1, and
the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette
transporters, were involved in the metabolic pathway
of SN-38 that had influence on its serum levels.14–16
Of these factors, UGT is considered the most important for the interindividual variability that affects SN38 serum levels.
UGT belongs to a superfamily of enzymes that
catalyze the glucuronidation of many exogenous and
endogenous substrates, including SN-38 and bilirubin. By alternative splicing, the UGT1 gene expresses
9 functional UGT1A proteins, and UGT1A1 is the
major protein that catalyzes the glucuronidation of
SN-38 and bilirubin.17 Mutations of the UGT1A1
gene result in the absence or reduction of UGT1A1
activity that may lead to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.18 In particular, the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism
consists of a thymine-adenine (TA) dinucleotide
insertion in the TATAA element of the promoter
region that results in the mutant genotype of

1933

A(TA)7TAA as opposed to the wild type of
A(TA)6TAA.19,20 According to the number of TA
repeats in 2 alleles, genotypes of the UGT1A1*28
polymorphism can be classified as TA6/TA6 (wild
type), TA6/TA7 (heterozygous mutant), or TA7/TA7
(homozygous mutant). In addition, the TA6/TA7 or
TA7/TA7 mutants have been associated with
decreased enzyme activity and glucuronidation of
SN-38, which may account for increased irinotecanrelated toxicity. It is noteworthy that ethnic differences do exist in the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism. The
prevalence of homozygous TA7/TA7 was significantly
greater in African populations (12%–27%) and in
Caucasian populations (5%–15%) but was much
lower (1.2%–5%) in South-east Asian and Pacific
populations, including Taiwan.21–24
Neutropenia and diarrhea are the major toxicities
associated with irinotecan treatment, and the frequency with which these toxicities occur depends on
the effectiveness of SN-38 glucuronidation mediated
by several hepatic and extrahepatic UGT1A glucuronosyl transferases. Among these, the UGT1A1 protein
has the highest capacity to glucuronidate SN-38.25–27
In addition to UGT1A1, hepatic UGT1A9 and extrahepatic UGT1A7 also are important components in the
glucuronidation of SN-38, and their genotypes also
may serve as predictors of response and toxicity in
patients with CRC who are treated with irinotecan. It
is noteworthy that patients with genotypes conferring
a lower UGT1A7 activity and the UGT1A9 (dT)(9/9)
genotype may be particularly likely to exhibit greater
antitumor response with little toxicity.26,27 In addition
to UGT1A1, UGT1A7, and UGT1A9, a minor role has
been suggested for UGT1A6, UGT1A8, and UGT1A10
in SN-38 glucuronidation.27
In the current study, we retrospectively examined
the prevalence of UGT1A1*28 polymorphisms in 128
patients with metastatic CRC who had received irinotecan plus 5-FU and leucovorin (LV) as first-line treatment. Characteristics that were correlated with this
polymorphism and toxicity and treatment outcomes
from irinotecan-based chemotherapy were analyzed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
To examine the impact of UGT1A1*28 polymorphism
on the toxicity and treatment outcome from irinotecan-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic
CRC, 152 consecutive patients with unresectable,
metastatic CRC who had received irinotecan plus 5FU and LV as first-line treatment from January 2003
to June 2006 were examined retrospectively. Among
them, 128 patients were enrolled and analyzed

remaining patients were excluded because they
lacked measurable lesions (n 5 8 patients), or did
not have a primary tumor removed to determine
accurate tumor (T) and lymph node (N) classifications (n 5 5), or died before blood sampling (n 5 5),
or were unwilling to participate (n 5 4), or were lost

consisted of irinotecan (180 mg/m2 as a 1-hour infusion on Day 1), LV (100 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion
on Days 1 and 2) before bolus 5-FU (400 mg/m2 on
Days 1 and 2), and infusional 5-FU (600 mg/m2 as a

morphism were followed similarly for a median
duration of 18 months. The responses and treatment-related toxicities were evaluated on the basis of
standard World Health Organization criteria. Patients
who achieved a complete response, a partial
response, or stable disease remained in the protocol
until they developed progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity was documented. Treatment was
delayed until recovery if grade 3/4 neutropenia or diarrhea occurred, and the doses of irinotecan were
reduced in subsequent cycles. In patients with intolerable neutropenia or uncontrolled diarrhea and in
patients who failed on a front-line irinotecan-based
regimen, the treatment was discontinued, and oxaliplatin-based or fluoropyrimidine-only regimens were
administered subsequently according to the physicians’ decision. During treatment, all patients visited
our outpatient clinic regularly for physical examinations and check-ups, which included complete blood
counts, liver and renal functions, and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. Chest x-rays,
abdominal ultrasound images, or computed tomography scans were obtained every 2 months. An institutional review board approved this study, and
informed consent was provided by all patients before
their blood was tested for genotyping.

Examination of the UGT1A1*28 Polymorphism
Genomic DNA was extracted from patients’ leukocytes, which were obtained from 0.5 mL of whole
blood by using standard phenol-chloroform methods,
and subjected to the genotyping procedure. Polymorphism of the UGT1A1 gene was examined
according to a method described previously.28 To analyze TA repeat polymorphisms in the promoter of
the UGT1A1 gene, an amplification product was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
sequencing. The sequences of the forward and
reverse primers were 50 -AAA TTC CAG CCA GTT CAA
CTG TTG TT-30 and 5-CTG CTG GAT GGC CCC AAG30 , respectively. Amplification was performed for 34
cycles and consisted of denaturation at 948C for 45
seconds, annealing at 628C for 45 seconds, and
extension at 728C for 60 seconds between the initial
denaturation at 948C for 2 minutes and a final extension at 728C for 1 minute. Finally, the PCR products
were sequenced to determine the number of TA
repeats over the promoter of the UGT1A1 gene.

polymorphisms of the number of 28-base pair (bp)
tandemly repeated sequence in the 50 -enhancer
region of the thymidylate synthase gene (TSER) have
a remarkable influence on the response and survival
of patients with CRC who receive 5-FU,29 we believed
that the influence of this polymorphism on patients
with or without UGT1A1*28 was of interest and
deserved further study. To examine this polymorphism in the TSER, an amplification product was generated by PCR for analysis. Genomic DNA was
prepared from patients’ leukocytes accordingly and a
set of primers for amplification of the TSER was used
according to a method described previously.30 The
sequences of the forward and reverse primers were
50 -GTG GCT CCT GCG TTT CCC CC-30 and 50 -CCA
AGC TTG GCT CCG AGC CGG CCA CAG GCA TGG
CGC GG-30 , respectively. Amplification was performed for 30 cycles and consisted of denaturation
at 948C for 1 minute, annealing at 608C for 1 minute,
and extension at 728C for 2 minutes between the initial denaturation at 948C for 2 minutes and a final
extension at 728C for 5 minutes. Finally, the amplified DNA fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis
on a 4% agarose gel to determine the number of a
28-bp tandemly repeated sequence over the TSER.
The terms 2R/2R, 3R/3R, and 2R/3R represent homozygous double-repeat, homozygous triple-repeat, and
heterozygous TSER polymorphisms, respectively.

Statistical Analysis and Plotting Survival Curves
According to the number of TA repeats in 2 alleles,
genotypes of the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism were
classified as TA6/TA6 (wild type), TA6/TA7 (heterozygous mutant), or TA7/TA7 (homozygous mutant). To
analyze survival and clinicopathologic characteristics,
patients were divided into 2 groups: those withTA6/
TA6 (wild type) and those with TA6/TA7 or TA7/TA7
(mutant type). Progression-free and overall survival
curves were plotted by using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method, and the statistical differences in
survival between subgroups were compared by using
the log-rank test. The correlations of age, sex, performance status, primary tumor site, histologic grade,
TNM classification, serum CEA levels, germ-line
polymorphisms of the number of a 28-bp tandemly
repeated sequence in the TSER, response rate, and
toxicity to irinotecan-based treatment were analyzed
separately according to the UGT1A1 genotypes. The
statistical differences of these correlations were
determined by using chi-square tests and were considered statistically different when P values
were <.05. All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSS software system (SPSS for Windows,
version 10.0, Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
UGT1A1*28 Polymorphism Is Associated With Increased
Irinotecan-induced Toxicities, Hospitalization Because of
Toxicities, and Treatment-related Mortality
An example of the PCR products that were analyzed
by agarose gel electrophoresis is shown in Figure 1.
Approximately 20% of patients were identified with
UGT1A1*28 polymorphism, and the frequencies of
the TA6/TA6, TA6/TA7, and TA7/TA7 genotypes were
79.7% (n 5 102 patients), 15.6% (n 5 20 patients),
and 4.7% (n 5 6 patients), respectively. There was no
significant between-group difference in clinicopathologic features, including TSER 28-bp polymorphisms,
among patients with or without this polymorphism
(Table 1). To no surprise, in the current study,
marked increases in grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (53.8%
vs 4.9%; P < .01) and diarrhea (26.9% vs 5.9%;
P < .01) were observed in patients with the TA6/TA7
or TA7/TA7 genotypes (Table 2). In total,19 patients
with or without the UGT1A1*28 allele experienced
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, and the timing varied
between the first cycle (n 5 3 patients), the second
cycle (n 5 4 patients), the third cycle (n 5 7
patients), and the forth cycle (n 5 5 patients) of
treatment.
Concordantly, dramatic increases in neutropenic
fever (38.5% vs 3.9%; P < .01), hospitalization for
managing neutropenic fever or grade 3 or 4 diarrhea
(50% vs 8.8%; P < .01), and treatment-related mortality (11.5% vs 2%; P < .01) also were observed in
patients with the TA6/TA7 or TA7/TA7 genotypes (Table 2). Three patients (11.5%) with TA6/TA7 or TA7/
TA7 genotypes died of treatment-related neutropenia
and bacteremia (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively), and

2 patients (2%) with the TA6/TA6 genotype died of
treatment-related neutropenia and bacteremia (Pseudomonas aeruginosa; P < .01). Although severe toxicities did occur in patients with the UGT1A1*28 allele,
the initial dose of irinotecan was not adjusted (or
reduced) according to the patients’ genotype,
because this was a retrospective study, and the majority of patients were not assessed for UGT1A1*28
before treatment. Furthermore, the ‘‘optimal dose’’ of
irinotecan for patients with the UGT1A1*28 allele
remains unclear.
Because 5-FU was used in combination with irinotecan, the differences in the numbers of 28-bp
tandemly repeated sequences in the TSER of patients
with or without the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism were

demly repeated sequence in the TSER. Lanes 7, 8, and 9 represent TSER

analyzed. Table 1 shows that the percentages of
patients with TSER 2R/2R, 2R/3R, and 3R/3R were
0.1%, 34.3%, and 64.7%, respectively, among those
who had the TA6/TA6 genotype. These rates were
very similar to the rates of 0%, 30.7%, and 69.2%,
respectively, in patients with the TA6/TA7 or TA7/TA7
genotypes (P 5 .82). Examples of the PCR products
that were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis for
the presence of 28-bp tandemly repeated sequence
polymorphisms of the TSER are shown in Figure 2.

UGT1A1*28 Is Associated With Increased Pretreatment
Bilirubin Levels, and Pretreatment Bilirubin Levels Also
May Predict Irinotecan-induced Toxicities
Because UGT1A1 is the major enzyme that catalyzes
the glucuronidation of bilirubin, and mutations of
this gene result in the absence or reduction of
UGT1A1 activity, which may lead to unconjugated
hyperbilirubinemia,17,18 it was proposed that patients
who had the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism would have
a greater prevalence of elevated pretreatment serum
bilirubin levels. Table 2 shows that a dramatic
increase in the prevalence of elevated pretreatment
bilirubin levels (23.1% vs 8.8%; P 5 .04) indeed was
observed in patients with the TA6/TA7 or TA7/TA7
genotypes.
In addition, because patients with UGT1A1*28
polymorphism have higher treatment-related toxicities and pretreatment bilirubin levels, a greater prevalence of toxicity was proposed in patients who had
elevated pretreatment bilirubin levels. Indeed, grade
3 or 4 neutropenia did occur in patients who had
higher pretreatment bilirubin levels (>1.5 mg/dL).

In the current study, elevated bilirubin levels were
identified in 15 patients, whereas the remaining

Ten patients (66.7%) who had higher pretreatment
bilirubin levels developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia,
whereas only 9 patients (8%) who had normal
pretreatment bilirubin levels developed grade 3 or 4
neutropenia (P < .01). Therefore, the pretreatment bilirubin level also may serve as a marker for predicting
irinotecan-induced toxicities.

Survival, or Overall Survival
Because the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism was associated with increased irinotecan-induced severe
neutropenia, neutropenic fever, and diarrhea, an
increased requirement for irinotecan dose reduction
in patients with this polymorphism was proposed.
Table 2 shows that the percentage of patients who
required an irinotecan dose reduction indeed was
significantly greater in patients with this polymorphism. In total, 24 patients required dose reductions for
irinotecan, including 11 patients (42.3%) with TA6/
TA7 or TA7/TA7 genotypes and 13 patients (12.7%)
with TA6/TA6 genotypes (P < .01). These patients
developed neutropenic fever (n 5 10), intolerable diarrhea (n 5 10), or both (n 5 4). The doses of irinotecan were reduced by approximately 30% in
subsequent cycles, and irinotecan was administered
at 120 mg/m2 (n 5 15) or at 130 mg/m2 (n 5 9),
whereas the doses of 5-FU and LV remained
unchanged. Eighteen patients (75%) tolerated the

modified doses well without requiring further dose
reductions of irinotecan. However, intolerable toxicities still occurred in 6 patients (25%), and subsequent treatments were switched to oxaliplatin-based
regimens immediately in these patients.
Because the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism leads to
a marked alteration in pharmacokinetics as well as
the need for irinotecan dose reduction, the influence
of this polymorphism on treatment outcomes has
become of extreme interest. In the current study, the
response rate was assessed every 4 cycles of treatment, and 17 patients (16.7%) with the TA6/TA6 genotype and 5 patients (19.2%) with the TA6/TA7 or
TA6/TA7 genotypes had progressive disease after 4
cycles of treatment (Table 3). It is noteworthy that,
although the requirement for irinotecan dose reduction was significantly greater in patients with the
TA6/TA7 or TA7/TA7 genotypes (42.3% vs 12.7%;
P < .01), there were no significant between-group differences in the response rate (42.3% vs 45.1%;
P 5 .80) (Table 3), in progression-free survival (10
months vs 11 months; P 5 .94) (Fig. 3), or in overall
survival (19 months vs 18 months; P 5 .84) (Fig. 4).
Therefore, the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism does not
seem to affect treatment outcomes with irinotecanbased chemotherapy in patients with metastatic CRC.

DISCUSSION
The identification of genetic variants that predispose
patients to severe toxicities from chemotherapeutic
agents is a critical issue. Our current data indicate
that the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism, through an extra
TA repeat insertion in the promoter of the UGT1A1

gene, is associated with a marked increase in irinotecan-induced grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (53.8% vs
4.9%; P < .01), neutropenic fever (38.5% vs 3.9%;
P < .01), treatment-related death (11.5% vs 2%;
P < .01), and diarrhea (26.9% vs 5.9%; P < .01), findings that are compatible with previous reports.9,31 It
is worth noting that, although the percentage of
patients who required an irinotecan dose reduction
was significantly greater in patients who had this
genetic variant (42.3% vs 12.7%; P < .01), it did not
affect the response rate to irinotecan-based chemotherapy (42.3% vs 45.1%; P 5 .80), progression-free
survival (10 months vs 11 months; P 5 .94), or overall
survival (19 months vs 18 months; P 5 .84). This
leads us to consider the possibility of using the
UGT1A1*28 polymorphism to optimize (or reduce)
irinotecan dosage without affecting its efficacy in the
treatment of patients with metastatic CRC.
Ethnic differences do exist in enzymes that
involve in the targeting and metabolism of specific
chemotherapeutic drugs, and these differences may
affect the sensitivity and toxicity to treatments in
cancer patients. For example, germ-line polymorphism of a 28-bp tandem repeat sequence in the TSER
significantly affected gene expression levels,
response, and survival in patients with metastatic
CRC who received fluoropyrimidine treatment.29,30
The homozygous triple-repeat polymorphism (3R/
3R) in TSER was twice as prevalent in Chinese individuals (67%) as it was in Caucasian individuals (38%),
a finding that may account for impaired treatment
outcomes with fluoropyrimidine regimens.32 Table 1
shows that approximately 66% of patients had a

homozygous triple-repeat polymorphism (3R/3R) in
the TSER, which is compatible with previous
reports.32 Although 5-FU was used in combination
with irinotecan in this study, the percentages of
TSER 2R/2R, 2R/3R, and 3R/3R were very similar in
patients with and without the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism (P 5 .82). Therefore, the influence of 5-FU
on treatment toxicity, response rates, and survival in
patients with or without the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism may be negligible.
The UGT1A1*28 polymorphism is relatively rare
in Asian populations.21–23 The prevalence of homozygous TA7/TA7 genotype of the UGT1A1 gene was significantly greater in Africans (12%–27%) and in
Caucasians (5%–15%), but it was much lower in
South-east Asian and Pacific populations (1.2%–
5%).21–23 In a study that was conducted by Huang
et al., UGT1A1*28 polymorphisms were examined in
a total of 290 healthy Taiwanese adults, and the prevalence of the TA6/TA7 and TA7/TA7 genotypes was
21.4% and 0%, respectively.24 In our study, the percentage of TA6/TA7 and TA7/TA7 genotypes was
15.6% (n 5 20) and 4.7% (n 5 6), respectively. A significantly lower prevalence of the homozygous TA7/
TA7 allele in our study correlates well with the observations of Huang et al. and others. In contrast to the
rarity of UGT1A1*28, it was demonstrated that the
UGT1A1*6 polymorphism was very frequent in Asian
populations.33,34 A recent, noteworthy study indicated that the UGT1A1*6 (c.211G > A) allele was
more predictive of neutropenia in Korean cancer
patients who were receiving irinotecan.33 In addition,
the presence of the homozygous UGT1A1*6 allele
was associated with a significantly higher exposure
levels to SN-38, lower relative extent of glucuronidation, and an approximately 3-fold increased risk of
developing grade 4 neutropenia in Asian cancer
patients, particularly among Chinese patients, who
were receiving irinotecan.34
In the current study, a dramatic increase in the
prevalence of elevated pretreatment bilirubin levels
(23.1% vs 8.8%; P 5 .04) was observed in patients
with the TA6/TA7 or TA7/TA7 genotypes (Table 2).
Because UGT1A1 is the major enzyme that catalyzes
the glucuronidation of bilirubin, and because mutations of this gene may lead to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia,17,18 elevated pretreatment bilirubin
levels may occur more often in patients who have
the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism. In addition to
UGT1A1 genotype, Innocenti et al. demonstrated
that the pretreatment bilirubin level was a useful
predictor of severe neutropenia in patients who were
receiving irinotecan.9 In that study, both bilirubin
and UGT1A1 genotype were statistically significant

UGT1A1*28 and Severe Toxicity in CRC/Liu et al.

for predicting which patients were at risk for developing severe toxicities, and the authors suggested
that total bilirubin may replace genotyping information when the latter is not available. In our study,
patients with higher pretreatment bilirubin levels
developed significantly more grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than patients who had normal bilirubin levels
(66.7% vs 8%; P < .01). Therefore, patients’ pretreatment bilirubin level may also serve as a useful
marker for predicting irinotecan-induced toxicities.
In addition to UGT1A1, several factors, including
CES, cytochrome p450 isoforms, multidrug resistance-associated proteins ABCB1 and ABCC2, organic
anion-transporting polypeptide SLCO1B1, and the
ATP-binding cassette transporters, also are involved
in the metabolic pathway of SN-38.14–16 Therefore,
the clinical application of routinely screening for the
UGT1A1*28 polymorphism to predict irinotecaninduced toxicity deserves further prospective studies.
However, for patients who have experienced early
and severe (grade 3 or 4) toxicities after irinotecanbased chemotherapy, it may be worthwhile to
examine for the presence of the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism to optimize subsequent irinotecan-based
treatment.
In the current study, both bolus and infusional
5-FU were administered with irinotecan as front-line
treatment to patients with metastatic CRC. Greater
than 80% of 5-FU is metabolized by the enzyme
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) in the liver,
and mutations in the DPD gene (DPYD) have been
associated with a lowered DPD activity, which may
lead to severe 5-FU-associated toxicities, mainly neutropenia and diarrhea. In a study conducted by Hsiao
et al., the frequency of 11 known mutations of the
DPYD gene and the correlations between these
mutations and DPD levels were analyzed in Taiwanese populations.35 In that study, DPD protein levels
were not altered (or reduced) significantly by these
mutations. In this regard, because the incidence of
severe neutropenia and diarrhea induced by irinotecan was significantly greater than that with 5-FU,
and because the influence of DPYD mutations on
5-FU metabolism was relatively trivial in Taiwanese
populations, 5-FU-associated toxicities may be
negligible.
In the current study, 24 patients required dose
reductions of irinotecan, and approximately 30% of
irinotecan doses were reduced in subsequent cycles.
Among them, 18 patients (75%) tolerated the modified doses well without requiring further dose reduction of irinotecan. Therefore, we proposed that
irinotecan at doses of 120 mg/m2 or 130 mg/m2
every 2 weeks may be feasible and safe for patients

1939

who have experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicities or who
are at risk for developing life-threatening toxicities
from irinotecan-based treatment, such as UGT1A1
polymorphisms.
In summary, the UGT1A1*28 polymorphism may
be a key determinant for predicting irinotecaninduced severe toxicities in Chinese patients with
metastatic CRC without affecting treatment outcome
or survival. Further prospective studies are warranted
for using this polymorphism to optimize irinotecanbased chemotherapy and to avoid life-threatening
toxicity.
