Abstract
Eradicating malignant tumors by vaccine-elicited host immunity remains a major medical challenge. To date,
correlates of immune protection remain unknown for malignant mesothelioma. In this study, we demonstrated
that antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell immune response correlates with the elimination of malignant mesothelioma
by a model PD-1–based DNA vaccine. Unlike the nonprotective tumor antigen WT1-based DNA vaccines, the
model vaccine showed complete and long-lasting protection against lethal mesothelioma challenge in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. Furthermore, it remained highly immunogenic in tumor-bearing animals and led to
therapeutic cure of preexisting mesothelioma. T-cell depletion and adoptive transfer experiments revealed
that vaccine-elicited CD8þ T cells conferred to the protective efﬁcacy in a dose-dependent way. Also, these CD8þ
T cells functioned by releasing inﬂammatory IFNg and TNFa in the vicinity of target cells as well as by initiating
TRAIL-directed tumor cell apoptosis. Importantly, repeated DNA vaccinations, a major advantage over livevectored vaccines with issues of preexisting immunity, achieve an active functional state, not only preventing the
rise of exhausted PD-1þ and Tim-3þ CD8þ T cells but also suppressing tumor-induced myeloid-derived
suppressive cells and Treg cells, with the frequency of antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells inversely correlating with
tumor mass. Our results provide new insights into quantitative and qualitative requirements of vaccine-elicited
functional CD8þ T cells in cancer prevention and immunotherapy. Cancer Res; 74(21); 6010–21. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Mesothelioma is a life-threatening malignant tumor in
humans (1). Signiﬁcant progresses have been made with
vaccines that can prevent oncovirus-associated liver and cervical cancers (2, 3). The passive administration of tumorspeciﬁc antibodies or immune cells such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), lymphokine-activated killer cell, and dendritic
cells (DC) has been clinically beneﬁcial to patients (4–6).
Despite these progresses, preventing and eradicating malignant tumor such as mesothelioma by vaccine-induced immune
surveillance remains difﬁcult even in animal model systems.

Immune surveillance prevents and eliminates transformed
tumor cells (7). The activation of oncogenes induces malignant
tumor while rendering them vulnerable to antitumor immune
effector cells such as CTLs and CD4þ Th1 cells (8, 9). When the
host immune system fails to eliminate tumor cells in time, they
may hijack ineffective immune responses to foster the growth
and progression of cancer (10). On the one hand, tumor cells
express inhibitory ligands on their surface to dysregulate T-cell
function through interaction with T-cell receptors such as
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), CTL-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), and immune regulator T cell immunoglobulin
mucin 3 (Tim-3; refs. 8, 11). On the other hand, the growing
tumor evades immune surveillance by sustaining immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSC)
and CD4þCD25þFoxp3þ regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg) systematically as well as in the tumor microenvironment (12).
We hypothesized that an effective cancer vaccine should
harness the immune system and reinstate immune surveillance by overcoming tumor-associated immune suppression.
To test this hypothesis, we sought to determine the efﬁcacy and
immune correlates of protection of conventional tumor antigen WT1 DNA vaccines and a soluble PD-1 (sPD1)-based fusion
DNA vaccine, namely sPD1-p24fc, via in vivo electroporation
(EP) delivery against malignant mesothelioma in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. The model xenoantigen p24 is
derived from HIV capsid protein GAG (13). sPD1-p24fc/EP
DNA vaccination induces uniquely high frequency of

Vaccine-Elicited CD8þ T Cells Cure Mesothelioma

antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells with broad reactivity, longterm memory, polyfunctionality, and cytotoxicity by targeting the p24 to DCs while triggering IL12 production and
antigen cross-presentation (13). Using a malignant murine
mesothelioma tumor engineered to express WT1 or GAG, we
demonstrate that functional antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells
are essential to achieve complete prevention and therapeutic cure of mesothelioma.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
AB1 cells, purchased from European Collection of Cell
Cultures, and B16F10 cells, a kind gift from Dr. Kevin Ng
(Department of Surgery, HKU LKS Faculty of Medicine,
Hong Kong SAR, P.R. China), were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Medium for
WT1-, GAG-, and luciferase-expressing cell lines was supplemented with 1 mg/mL puromycin (Invitrogen).
Mice
All animal experiments were approved by the Committee on
the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research (CULATR) of
The University of Hong Kong (HKU #2438-11). Five- to 8-weekold female BALB/c, C.B-17/Icr-scid (SCID), and C57BL/6 mice
were maintained according to standard operational procedures at HKU Laboratory Animal Unit.
Mouse immunization and tumor challenge
Vaccination was performed as described previously (13). For
tumor inoculation, BALB/c or SCID mice were injected with a
lethal dose of 5  105 AB1, AB1-WT1, or AB1-GAG cells,
whereas C57BL/6 mice received 5  105 B16F10-GAG cells in
the right hind ﬂank subcutaneously. Live bioluminescence
images were taken weekly. Tumor size was measured using
calipers [tumor volume ¼ 1/2(length  width2)]. Under HKU
Laboratory Animal Unit guidelines, mice were sacriﬁced when
tumor size was >15 mm.

In vivo CD4þ and CD8þ T-cell depletion study
During prophylactic or therapeutic vaccination, BALB/c
mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1 mg anti-CD4
mAb (YTS191.1, Bio X cell) or anti-CD8 mAb (YTS169.4, Bio X
cell) one day before tumor inoculation and repeated weekly
(15–17). Successful T-cell depletion was conﬁrmed by ﬂow
cytometric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
T-cell puriﬁcation and adoptive transfer
CD4þ or CD8þ T cells were isolated using Dynabeads
Untouched T Cell Kits (Invitrogen) from splenocytes of vaccinated BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice 2 weeks after the last immunization. For adoptive transfer, 1.5–2  106 CD4þ or CD8þ
T cells in 100 mL PBS were injected intravenously via tail vein
into each mouse that were preinoculated with tumor cells
(Fig. 4F; refs. 18, 19).
T-cell cytotoxicity and TRAIL blocking assay
The LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (Invitrogen) was
used to deﬁne the cytotoxic effect of splenocytes or puriﬁed
T cells as previously described (13). For the TRAIL blocking
assay, activated CD8þ T cells as effector were cocultured with
AB1-GAG cells as target at an effector:target (E:T) ratio of 10:1
(Fig. 4H) with or without 2 mg/mL of TRAIL blocking (clone
N2B2, eBioscience), Fas ligand blocking (clone MFL4,
eBioscience) antibodies or isotype control before ﬂow cytometric analysis (20).
Cytokine production assay
A total of 2  105 splenocytes or puriﬁed CD4þ or CD8þ T
cells from immunized mice were cocultured with g-irradiated
AB1-GAG cells at a 10:1 ratio of effector to tumor cell. IL2 was
not added in culture medium during the ﬁrst two days (18).
Supernatants from day 2, 5, and 7 after coculture were quantiﬁed for cytokines using the mouse Th1/Th2/Th17/Th22
13-plex FlowCytomix Kit (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

WT1-, GAG-, and luciferase-expressing mesothelioma
and melanoma cell lines
The generation of these cell lines by retroviral vector pBABEluc-puro is depicted in Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2. 293T
cells were cotransfected with pBABE-based vector and the
packaging plasmid pCL-Amphotropic to generate retroviral
supernatants (14). AB1 and B16F10 cells were infected with
corresponding supernatants and selected with 1 mg/mL puromycin. Single clones were obtained by limiting dilution of
puromycin-resistant cells and screened under the IVIS100
Imaging System, and the luciferase expression was measured
within the region of interest (ROI).

Cell-cycle analysis
A total of 5  104 AB1-GAG cells were seeded into each well
of 24-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, culture medium was
replaced with 500 mL of previously collected supernatants
(from day 5 after coculture of CD8þ T cells and g-irradiated
AB1-GAG cells). Cells were incubated for an additional
48 hours, resuspended in 500 mL culture medium containing
1 mL of Vybrant DyeCycle Violet Stain (Invitrogen) and then
incubated at 37 C with 5% CO2 for 30 minutes before analysis
using FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software
(Tree Star, v7.6).

Flow cytometry analysis, Elispot, and serum ELISA for
assessing p24-speciﬁc immune responses
Cell surface and intracellular immunostaining, Elispot as
well as ELISA were performed as previously described (13).
CD8-speciﬁc tetramer against HIV-1 GAG p24 gagA-I epitope
AMQMLKETI was used for assay (Beckman Coulter). Flow
cytometric data analysis was performed using the FlowJo
software (Tree Star, v7.6).

Isolation of splenocytes and tumor cells
Splenocytes were isolated as previously described (13).
Tumors were removed using forceps and cut into 1 mm3
pieces by surgical scissors before being treated with DMEM
containing 1 mg/mL collagenase IA (Sigma) and DNase I
(Roche) for 2 hours on a rocking platform at 37 C. The
resulting cell suspension was treated with BD Pharm Lyse
Lysing Buffer and passed through a 70 mm cell strainer. To

obtain tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL), cells were
resuspended in 5 mL 33% Percoll (in Hank's Balanced Salt
Solution) and centrifuged at 2,300 rpm for 20 minutes.
Statistical analysis
A two-tailed Student t test was performed to determine
statistical signiﬁcance. P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant. Survival of challenged mice was plotted on
Kaplan–Meier survival curve and the observed difference was
determined using a log-rank test (GraphPad Prism 5 software,
www.graphpad.com). Data represent mean values  SEM.
Correlation analyses were performed by linear regression.
EC50 value was calculated according to a four-parameter
logistic function.

Results
Active DNA vaccination protects mice completely against
lethal mesothelioma cell challenge
As WT1-based DNA vaccines were capable to reject
implanted leukemia cells (21), we sought to determine the
efﬁcacy of two similar vaccines, TruncWT1His and Full WT1His
(Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B), in inhibiting mesothelioma
growth. While wild-type AB1 cells do not express WT1, we
established an AB1-WT1 mesothelioma model (Supplementary Fig. S1C–S1F). The expression of WT1 was conﬁrmed by
Western blotting and ﬂow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S1D
and S1E). Strong correlations were observed between the
AB1-WT1 cell number and luciferase signal intensity (Supplementary Fig. S1F, left; r2 ¼ 0.9941) and between in vivo tumor

volume and luciferase signal intensity (Supplementary Fig. S1F,
right; r2 ¼ 0.9519). We then immunized BALB/c mice at
the dose of 100 mg DNA intramuscularly via EP three times
at 3-week intervals (Fig. 1A; ref. 13). Both vaccines induced
similar levels of WT1-speciﬁc IgG antibody (Fig. 1B) and IFN-g
Elispots in splenocytes (Fig. 1C) as compared with PBS controls. Subsequently, mice were challenged subcutaneously with
a lethal dose of 5  105 AB1-WT1 cells 2 weeks after the last
vaccination. Both vaccines failed to control tumor growth (Fig.
1D) or to prolong survival (Fig. 1E). Only weak cytotoxicity
effect was observed in Full WT1-vaccinated mice at an E:T ratio
of 20:1 (Fig. 1F). Conventional WT1-based DNA/EP vaccines,
therefore, induced limited immune responses against malignant mesothelioma.
As sPD1-p24fc/EP DNA vaccination could elicit up to 21.2%
of tetramer-positive CD8þ T cells in spleen (13), we aimed to
study the correlation of effective immune responses and
mesothelioma control by utilizing this model vaccine. Therefore, a xenoantigen GAG-expressing mesothelioma cell line
(AB1-GAG) was generated, with equal tumorigenicity and
lethality as compared with wild-type AB1 (Supplementary Fig.
S2A–S2F). Using the same immunization schedule and lethal
challenge dose as WT1-based vaccines (Fig. 2A; ref. 13), sPD1p24fc/EP proved signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than controls
(p24fc/EP or PBS) at eliminating implanted AB1-GAG cells
(Fig. 2B), which resulted in complete rejection 10 days after
challenge and mice remained tumor-free for more than 40 days
(Fig. 2C and F). These protected mice also completely rejected
tumor 9 days after rechallenge and remained tumor-free for 30

weeks (Fig. 2D–F). In contrast, all control mice developed
tumors and died within 30 days (Fig. 2E). Splenocytes of
sPD1-p24fc/EP-immunized mice showed a strong cytotoxicity
effect against AB1-GAG cells in vitro even at 0.5:1 E:T ratio (Fig.
2G). However, sPD1-p24fc/EP did not control wild-type AB1
tumor growth (Fig. 2H), suggesting that antigen-speciﬁc
immune responses are essential for complete and long-lasting
protection.
Therapeutic cure of mesothelioma by vaccine-elicited
immune responses
So far, conventional DNA vaccines have little therapeutic
efﬁcacy against solid tumors (22, 23). To determine the
therapeutic effects of sPD1-p24fc/EP, mice were ﬁrst inoculated subcutaneously with the lethal dose of AB1-GAG cells
followed by sPD1-p24fc/EP, p24fc/EP or sham vaccination
the next day and every 2 weeks for four times (Fig. 3A).
Critically, sPD1-p24fc/EP remained immunogenic with
potent p24-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell and antibody (both IgG1
and IgG2a) responses induced in tumor-bearing mice (Fig.

www.aacrjournals.org

3B). TetramerþCD8þ T cells reached an average of 17.5% of
total splenic CD8þ T cells (13). The ﬁrst sPD1-p24fc/EP
vaccination did not alter tumor growth similar to p24fc/EP
or sham (Fig. 3C and E), which established approximately
10 mm in diameter. The control of these established solid
tumors was observed after the second vaccination, and
complete rejection of tumor was obtained after the third
vaccination at day 29 in 3 of 5 mice (Fig. 3C–E). In contrast,
p24fc/EP failed to show any therapeutic effect. All mice in the
control groups died on day 38, whereas 100% survival was
achieved by sPD1-p24fc/EP (Fig. 3D). An additional sPD1p24fc/EP at day 43 resulted in complete rejection of solid
tumor 7 days later in all mice (Fig. 3D and E), and survived
more than 30 weeks with no tumor recurrence (Fig. 3D).
Inoculation of AB1-GAG cells in the PBS group elicited low
anti-p24 immune responses that could not prevent tumor
growth (Fig. 3B–D). Hence, repeated sPD1-p24fc/EP DNA
vaccination demonstrated not only potent immunogenicity
but also therapeutic cure of malignant mesothelioma in
tumor-bearing BALB/c mice.

B, two weeks after vaccination, p24-speciﬁc cellular (left) and humoral responses (right) in the peripheral blood of tumor-bearing

of tumor-bearing mice. F, dose-dependent effect of sPD1-p24fc vaccination in tumor regression (n ¼ 5 mice). G, AB1-GAG tumor-bearing mice
(n ¼ 5) were treated with combinations of 100 mg sPD1-p24fc/EP, 100 mg p24fc/EP, 200 mg anti–PD-1 mAb (i.p.), and 100 mg sPD1fc/EP and assessed for tumor
growth. Data represent mean  SEM.  , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01. Three independent experiments were performed for B–E.

As antigen-speciﬁc immune responses had dose-dependent
characteristics (13), three groups of mice were immunized
with sPD1-p24fc/EP at 100, 20, and 4 mg of DNA one day after
AB1-GAG inoculation according to the same experimental
schedule (Fig. 3A), respectively. As expected, therapeutic cure
was reproduced in the 100 mg group (Fig. 3F and Supplementary Fig. S3A). Similar to p24fc/EP, 4 mg sPD1-p24fc/EP failed to
reject established tumor, whereas the 20 mg group displayed
partial efﬁcacy at day 27 after the third vaccination. The EC50
value for sPD1-p24fc/EP efﬁcacy against mesothelioma is
calculated to be 23.95 mg DNA in mice.
Furthermore, previous studies showed that anti–PD-1 mAb
or soluble PD-1 can suppress tumor growth by blocking PD-1
pathway (24). To understand such effects in our vaccine
setting, we administered tumor-bearing BALB/c mice with
anti-PD-1 mAb alone or with p24fc/EP in combination with
anti–PD-1 mAb or sPD1fc/EP in parallel to sPD1-p24fc/EP (Fig.
3G). Anti–PD-1 mAb after the ﬁrst injection resulted in
partial tumor regression (1/5 mice in anti–PD-1
mAbþp24fc/EP group and 2/5 mice in anti–PD-1 mAb
alone group, respectively; ref. 25). However, this effect

6014

was abolished when tumor developed in large volume
during second and third vaccination. Administration of
sPD1fcþp24fc/EP elicited limited immune responses with
no beneﬁts in terms of rejecting established tumors (13).
Again, only sPD1-p24fc/EP eliminated established AB1-GAG
malignant mesothelioma (Fig. 3G). These results suggest
the need of enhancing antitumor immunity by vaccination
besides blocking the immune checkpoint.
Vaccine-elicited CD8þ T cells are responsible for
mesothelioma elimination
We next investigated the types of immune response that
correlate with mesothelioma elimination. In the therapeutic
setting (26), CD4þ or CD8þ T cells were depleted by i.p. injection
of commercial anti-CD4 (YTS191.1) or anti-CD8 antibody
(YTS169.4), respectively, starting 1 day before tumor inoculation
and repeated weekly (Fig. 4A; refs. 15, 16). Depletion of CD4þ T
cells before and during vaccination still resulted in tumor
rejection, leading to complete elimination of tumor in a timeframe similar to isotype control (Fig. 4B). The efﬁcacy of sPD1p24fc/EP is, therefore, less dependent on CD4+ T cells. However,

Vaccine-Elicited CD8þ T Cells Cure Mesothelioma

splenocytes of sPD1-p24fc/EP–vaccinated mice were
injected intravenously 7 days after inoculation of AB1-GAG
cells (Fig. 4F), respectively, when tumor size reached approximately 5 to 10 mm in diameter. As compared with p24fc/EP
and PBS controls, mice that received sPD1-p24fc/EP–
induced CD8þ T cells showed signiﬁcant rejection of established solid tumors (Fig. 4G), likely owing to their potent
cytotoxicity against AB1-GAG cells ex vivo starting from 0.2:1
E:T ratio (Fig. 4H) and led to 100% survival during the 44
days of the experiment (Fig. 4I, P < 0.01). To a much lower
extent, adoptive transfer of CD4þ T cells resulted in slower
tumor growth during the ﬁrst 31 days and appeared to

the therapeutic effect of sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccination was abolished when CD8þ T cells were depleted, and all mice died in less
than 30 days (Fig. 4B). Similar results were observed for CD4þ
and CD8þ T cells in the prophylactic setting (Fig. 4C; ref. 17).
After depletion of CD4þ T cells, sPD1-p24fc/EP–vaccinated mice
were able to eliminate tumor growth effectively (Fig. 4D, P ¼
0.0096), achieving 100% survival (Fig. 4E). In contrast,
only partial protection was observed after CD8þ T cells were
depleted (Fig. 4D, P ¼ 0.0384) with 40% survival (Fig. 4E).
To conﬁrm these ﬁndings, we performed T-cell adoptive
transfer experiments in immunodeﬁcient SCID mice (18, 19).

express DR5 but not Fas on surface (Fig. 5B), we focused on the
TRAIL-DR4/DR5 apoptotic pathway (28). Vaccination with
sPD1-p24fc/EP resulted in selective upregulation of TRAIL on
tetramerþCD8þ T cells (Fig. 5C). AB1-GAG cells were then
cocultured with puriﬁed CD8þ T cells isolated from sPD1p24fc/EP–vaccinated or control mice together with TRAIL
blocking or control antibodies (Fas ligand blocking and isotype
antibodies). Blocking of TRAIL reduced signiﬁcantly the cytolytic activity of CD8þ T cells from sPD1-p24fc/EP–vaccinated
mice (Fig. 5D).
To determine the functionality of T cells in vivo, we further
assessed splenic T cells and TILs following vaccination of 100
mg sPD1-p24fc/EP or controls in tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 3A)
and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S6).
sPD1-p24fc/EP mice had signiﬁcantly higher levels of antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells in their spleens at day 28 and 42 by
tetramer staining (Supplementary Fig. S7A). However, in TILs,
strikingly high (>80%) p24-tetramerþCD8þ T cells in both
groups were observed, suggesting that a signiﬁcant portion of
T cells inﬁltrating tumors were speciﬁc for p24. Next, CD8þ T
cells from both spleens and tumor were assayed for cytokine
production at day 14, 28, and 42 after tumor challenge, which
consistently showed reduced tumor size at day 42, the end
point of observation before measurement of complete regression. sPD1-p24fc/EP led to signiﬁcantly increased IFNg and
TNFa production by CD8þ T cells in both the spleen and TILs
as compared with p24fc/EP control (Supplementary Fig. S7B).
Furthermore, frequencies of polyfunctional CD8þ T cells that
produce dual cytokines (TNFa and IFNg) were substantially
higher with sPD1-p24fc/EP in both spleen and TILs (Fig. 6A
and Supplementary Fig. S7C). However, no difference was
found for IL2 or IL10–expressing CD8þ T cells in either the
spleen or tumor (Supplementary Fig. S8A). As differentiation
and cytotoxicity of CD8þ T cells are regulated by transcription
factors T-bet and eomesodermin (Eomes; ref. 29), we

relapse thereafter (Fig. 4J). These cells showed modest
cytotoxic effects starting at 2:1 E:T ratio (Fig. 4K) and led
to 40% survival (Fig. 4L, P < 0.05). The tumor protection
we have observed so far was not due to antibody-dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity, as passive transfer of antisera
derived from sPD1-p24fc/EP-immunized mice did not show
any protective effects in SCID mice (Supplementary Fig.
S3B). These ﬁndings were reproduced in another C57BL/6
melanoma model of GAG-transduced B16F10 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). B16F10-GAG tumor regression and
enhanced survival was observed after adoptive transfer of
CD8þ T cells isolated from 20 mg dose of sPD1-p24fc/EP but
not p24fc/EP-vaccinated C57BL/6 mice (Supplementary Fig.
S4C–S4E). Taken together, vaccine-elicited CD8þ T cells
proved essential in eliminating mesothelioma and melanoma cells.
Mechanism of vaccine-elicited CD8þ T cells in
controlling mesothelioma
Previous studies have demonstrated that tumor cells could
be eliminated by T-cell–dependent multifaceted killing effects
(27). Consistently, sPD1-p24fc/EP–elicited CD8þ T cells did not
produce stronger perforin and granzyme B upon antigen
stimulation (13). However, CD8þ T cells of sPD1-p24fc/EP–
vaccinated mice released signiﬁcantly higher levels of IFNg
when cocultured with AB1-GAG cells in vitro, as compared with
controls (Fig. 5A). Culture with these supernatants increased
the fraction of AB1-GAG cells in G1 cell-cycle arrest by approximately 5% to 10% as compared with PBS group (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Similar effect was observed when culturing
AB1-GAG cells with commercial IFNg (Supplementary Fig.
S5B), which was further enhanced when both IFNg and TNFa
were present (Supplementary Fig. S5C). Besides cytokine
effects, direct killing through apoptosis pathways is involved in
CD8þ T-cell–mediated cytotoxicity. As AB1-GAG tumor cells

measured their expression besides GATA-3. Indeed, CD8þ T
cells induced by sPD1-p24fc/EP expressed signiﬁcantly higher
levels of T-bet and Eomes in both spleen and TILs (Fig. 6A),
but no difference in GATA-3 was observed (Supplementary
Fig. S8A). Elevated IFNg þ/TNFaþ, T-bet and Eomes in adoptively transferred sPD1-p24fc/EP-induced CD8þ T cells into
tumor-bearing mice were also found (Fig. 6B), suggesting the
importance of these cells for effective elimination of tumor
cells (Fig. 4G).
Vaccine-elicited CD8þ T cells overcome tumor-induced
immunosuppression
The establishment of an immunosuppressive environment is associated with tumor immune escape and development (12). We, therefore, sought to investigate this
through measuring the expression of the surface molecules
PD-1, Tim-3, and CTLA-4 on CD8þ T cells; PD-L1 and PD-L2

on tumor-associated cells; and proportions of Treg
(CD4þCD25þFoxp3þ) and MDSCs (CD11bþGr-1þ) among
different treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. S6). As early
as 7 days after inoculation, AB1-GAG resulted in signiﬁcant
expansion of PD-1þ and Tim-3þ CD8þ T as well as Treg and
MDSC cells in the spleens of nonvaccinated mice (Supplementary Fig. S9). Moreover, tumor development was associated with signiﬁcantly increased frequencies of PD-1þ and
Tim-3þ CD8þ T cells and of Treg and MDSC cells in
p24fc/EP-vaccinated mice (Fig. 7A). In contrast, the frequencies of these immunosuppressive cells were signiﬁcantly
lower in sPD1-p24fc/EP–vaccinated mice in both spleen and
tumor (Fig. 7A), with the exception of PD-1 expression on
tumor-inﬁltrating CD8þ T cells. No signiﬁcant differences were
found with CTLA4þ CD8þ T cells and PD-L1þ tumor-associated cells (TAC; Supplementary Fig. S8B). However, TACs
showed higher PD-L2 expression in p24fc/EP-vaccinated mice

Vaccine-Elicited CD8þ T Cells Cure Mesothelioma

compared with sPD1-p24fc/EP (Fig. 7A and Supplementary Fig.
S6C), in line with high PD-1þCD8þ T cells, suggesting that PD1/PD-L2–negative signaling could occur within the tumor
microenvironment.
To investigate whether the surface expression of Tim-3 and
PD-1 on CD8þ T cells reﬂects impaired functionality of cytokine production, we characterized the pattern of Tim-3 and
PD-1 expression on both splenic and tumor-inﬁltrating tetramer-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells. TetramerþCD8þ T cells from tumor
showed PD-1 and Tim-3 expression, whereas splenic tetramerþ
CD8þ T cells were negative for PD-1 or Tim-3 (Fig. 7C, left and
Supplementary Fig. S10A). Importantly, Tim-3þ or PD-1þ
CD8þ T cells rendered lack of IFNg and TNFa production,
whereas PD-1Tim-3 CD8þ T cells showed increased frequencies of IFNg þTNFaþ population after repeated sPD1p24fc/EP vaccination (Supplementary Fig. S10B). In addition,
tetramerþTim-3þ and tetramerþPD-1þ CD8þ T cells did not
produce IFNg or TNFa when inﬁltrated into tumor (Supplementary Fig. S10C), whereas splenic tetramerþCD8þ T cells
(Tim-3 or PD-1 negative) could still produce IFNg and TNFa
(Fig. 7C, right). Together, these data implied that PD-1 and
Tim-3 expression on CD8þ T cells represents exhausted functional phenotypes in mice bearing AB1-GAG malignant
mesothelioma.
To investigate whether the immunosuppressive cells could
be associated with functional CD8þ T cells, correlation analyses were performed. Interestingly, in spleen, the frequency of
tetramerþCD8þ T cells was inversely correlated with Treg
(Supplementary Fig. S11A), whereas the frequency of
MDSCs was positively correlated with either PD-1þCD8þ or
Tim-3þCD8þ T cells (Supplementary Fig. S11B), suggesting
that Treg and MDSC may contribute to the suppression of
CD8þ T-cell function. As tumor mass is determined by the ratio
of T-effectors to Tregs (30), we found that this ratio in either
spleen or tumor was inversely correlated with tumor mass after
sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccination (Supplementary Fig. S11C). In same
tissue compartments, we further found that the ratio of
effector tetramerþCD8/MDSCs was inversely correlated with
tumor mass with stronger statistical signiﬁcance (Supplementary Fig. S11D).
Next, to further illustrate the importance of sPD1-p24fc/
EP–elicited CD8þ T cells in overcoming the tumor immunosuppressive environment, adoptive transfer experiment
conﬁrmed that these cells alone retained low expression of
Tim-3 in both spleen and tumor, low PD-1 in spleen but not
in tumor, and elimination of MDSCs and PD-L2þ TACs (Fig.
7B), with the frequency of tetramerþCD8þ T cells inversely
correlated with tumor mass (Fig. 7D, left). Inverse correlation was also found between the ratio of tetramerþCD8/
MDSCs and tumor mass in both spleen and tumor (Fig. 7D,
middle and right). Consistently, the frequency of MDSCs was
positively correlated with PD-1þCD8þ or Tim-3þCD8þ T
cells in spleen (Supplementary Fig. S12A), which in turn
pertain to weak TNFa production in spleen (Supplementary
Fig. S12B) and TNFa and IFNg production of TILs (Supplementary Fig. S12C). Collectively, sPD1-p24fc/EP–elicited
CD8þ T cells are essential in overcoming tumor-induced
immunosuppression.

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrated that high frequency of
vaccine-elicited effector CD8þ T cells plays a central role in
preventing and curing malignant mesothelioma that expresses
the cognate p24 antigen (Figs. 2–4). To our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst study to show that active DNA vaccination alone elicits
these protective CD8þ T cells with such efﬁcacy by overcoming
tumor-associated immunosuppression in an immunocompetent animal cancer model (Figs. 5–7). Moreover, vaccine-elicited CD8þ T cells with T-betþ, Eomesþ, and IFNg þTNFaþ
phenotypes could retain their effector functions once inﬁltrated into tumor, reduce MDSC and Treg cell populations, and
lead to the complete clearance of tumor cells. Importantly, only
the sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccine, but not conventional DNA vaccines, could elicit such CD8þ T cells with the properties of
broad reactivity, long-term memory, polyfunctionality, and
cytotoxicity (13). Thus, T-cell programming that could
enhance the functionality of CD8þ T cells is an important
aspect of tumor vaccine (31). Therefore, such an active vaccination using repeatable sPD1-based DNA/EP vaccine, a major
advantage over live-vectored vaccines, can be further developed as a strategy for immunotherapy of cancer such as
malignant mesothelioma. Our results warrant future investigation of cancer cure using combined active vaccination and
immune checkpoint blockade (Fig. 3G).
sPD1-p24fc/EP–elicited CD8þ T cells retain an active functional state after repeated vaccinations. Previous studies
showed that tumor-inﬁltrating CD8þ T cells, as well as tumor
antigen-speciﬁc T cells in nonsolid tumors, express a high level
of PD-1 (11), which would be functionally impaired upon
interaction with its ligands PD-L1/PD-L2 that are commonly
expressed by the tumor and myeloid cells present in the tumor
microenvironment (32). Here, we found that sPD1-p24fc/EP–
elicited CD8þ T cells expressed low PD-1 in the spleen, but
acquired a high level of PD-1 expression similar to control
vaccines once inside the tumor. Despite this, the frequencies of
tumor-inﬁltrating polyfunctional IFNg þ/TNFaþ CD8þ T cells
remained high (Fig. 6A and B). Moreover, PD-L2 expression on
TACs was signiﬁcantly suppressed in sPD1-p24fc/EP–vaccinated mice and by adoptively transferred CD8þ T cells (Fig. 7A and
B; 33, 34), which suggests that PD-1/PD-L2 engagement has less
chance to occur.
Recent studies indicated that exhausted CD8þ T cells also
upregulate Tim-3 (35), particularly in melanoma (36), leukemia
(37), colon carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, and sarcoma
(38, 39). Here, we found that PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on
tumor-inﬁltrated CD8þ T cells abolished their ability to produce both IFNg and TNFa (Supplementary Fig. S10B). Furthermore, we consistently found strong inverse correlations
between frequencies of Tim-3þCD8þ T cells and IFNg þCD8þ
or TNFaþCD8þ T cells, indicating that Tim-3 is a useful marker
for the assessment of functional antitumor CD8þ T cells
besides PD-1 (Supplementary Fig. S12B and S12C; ref. 39).
Unlike PD-1, however, Tim-3 expression on CD8þ T cells after
repeated sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccinations remained low in tumor
(Fig. 7A), suggesting that vaccine-elicited CD8þ T cells retained
the active functional state without exhibiting this immunosuppressed phenotype, which was further indicated by high

levels of IFNg þ/TNFaþ, T-bet, and Eomes expression (Fig. 6A
and B; ref. 40). Further examination of p24 tetramer-speciﬁc
CD8þ T cells in the spleen showed that TNFa and IFNg are
realized when PD-1 and Tim-3 expression remains low (Supplementary Fig. S10B and S10C). However, tumor-inﬁltrated
tetramerþCD8þ T cells upregulate PD-1 and Tim-3 and reduce
TNFa and IFNg production. As demonstrated in our adoptive
transfer experiments (Fig. 4G–I), CD8þ T cells alone can reduce
tumor volume, suggesting that these cells must be functional
initially when they reach the tumor site. These results suggested that even most tetramerþCD8þ T cells become functionally exhausted in the tumor (Fig. 7C; ref. 41); the continuous
dynamic inﬂux of functional CD8þ T cells resulting from
repeated sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccinations eventually overcame
tumor microenvironment and eliminated the tumor. Besides,
because sPD1-p24fc/EP vaccination enhanced T-cell epitopic
breadth (13), expanded CTL populations recognizing broader
repertoire of antigens may also contribute to the protective
effects (42).
This study also shows important characteristics for vaccineelicited CD8þ T cells required to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment established by high MDSC
and Treg cells (12, 43). We found strong positive correlations
between the frequencies of MDSC and PD-1þCD8þ or Tim3þCD8þ T cells (Supplementary Figs. S11B and S12A), reafﬁrming the function of MDSCs in suppressing CD8þ T-cell
function (32, 43). Interestingly, in sPD1-p24fc/EP–vaccinated
mice or mice receiving sPD1-p24fc/EP–elicited CD8þ T cells
alone, MDSCs were signiﬁcantly reduced in both spleen and
tumor, which likely assisted the elimination of solid tumor
through high levels of tetramerþ CD8þ T cells (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Fig. S7). This notion was supported by our
results showing strong inverse relationships between
tetramerþCD8þ T cells or tetramerþCD8þ T cells:MDSC ratio
and tumor mass (Fig. 7D and Supplementary Fig. S11D). One
enticing question is the mechanism by which sPD1-p24fc/EP–
induced CD8þ T cells eliminate MDSCs. On the one hand, the
effective killing of tumor by these CD8þ T cells would reduce
tumor-induced MDSCs (Figs. 4H and 7). On the other hand,
polyfunctional CD8þ T cells inﬁltrating into the tumor could
secrete multiple cytokines such as IFNg and TNFa to perturb
MDSC function or differentiation (Fig. 6; refs. 9, 13, 44). In
addition, MDSCs can acquire soluble antigen and present to
antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells, which lead to T-cell tolerance by
nitration of the TCR through MDSC-secreted peroxynitrite
(45). sPD1-p24fc/EP–elicited CD8þ T cells may, in turn, kill
the p24 peptide presenting MDSCs in a process similar to CTL
killing of peptide-labeled DCs in vivo (46, 47). CD8þ T cell could

also evade Treg suppression by direct killing (48), which was
also reﬂected by our data that high level of antigen-speciﬁc
CD8þ T cells correlated with low level of Treg cells (Supplementary Fig. S11A).
Finally, to test the vaccine in a more physiologic setting, we
investigated tumor antigen WT1 (49) in the context of PD-1–
based DNA vaccination (e.g., sPD1-WT1/EP). Our preliminary
results showed neither the enhancement of WT1-speciﬁc
CD8þ T-cell immune responses nor antitumor effect against
WT1-expressing mesothelioma (data not shown), suggesting a
limitation of such vaccine for immune recognition of this selftumor antigen, likely due to antigen tolerance and T-cell clone
depletion from self-antigen vaccination (50). Therefore, future
investigations should evaluate modiﬁed self-tumor antigens or
virus-encoded tumor antigens to generate highly reactive
CD8þ T cells. In addition, given the great efﬁcacy of sPD1p24fc/EP vaccine in tumor models, future studies should
evaluate its application in eliminating HIV-infected cells
including the latent reservoir.
