BACKGROUND: This report describes the results of an analysis of patient-reported outcomes from EMILIA (TDM4370g/BO21977),
a randomized phase 3 study of the antibody–drug conjugate trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) versus capecitabine and lapatinib in
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: A secondary
endpoint of the EMILIA study was time to symptom worsening (time from randomization to the first documentation of a  5-point
decrease from baseline) as measured by the Trial Outcome Index Physical/Functional/Breast (TOI-PFB) subset of the Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Breast questionnaire. Predefined exploratory patient-reported outcome endpoints included proportion of patients with a clinically significant improvement in symptoms (per TOI-PFB) and proportion of patients with diarrhea symptoms (per Diarrhea Assessment Scale). RESULTS: In the T-DM1 arm, 450 of 495 patients had a baseline and  1 postbaseline TOI-PFB
score versus 445 of 496 patients in the capecitabine-plus-lapatinib arm. Time to symptom worsening was delayed in the T-DM1 arm
versus the capecitabine-plus-lapatinib arm (7.1 months versus 4.6 months, respectively; hazard ratio 5 0.796; P 5.0121). In the T-DM1
arm, 55.3% of patients developed clinically significant improvement in symptoms from baseline versus 49.4% in the capecitabineplus-lapatinib arm (P 5.0842). Although similar at baseline, the number of patients reporting diarrhea symptoms increased 1.5- to
2-fold during treatment with capecitabine and lapatinib but remained near baseline levels in the T-DM1 arm. CONCLUSIONS: Together
with the EMILIA primary data, these results support the concept that T-DM1 has greater efficacy and tolerability than capecitabine

INTRODUCTION
Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) comprising the humanized monoclonal antibody
trastuzumab, a unique stable linker, and the highly potent cytotoxic agent DM1. In preclinical studies, it has been shown
that T-DM1 delivers DM1 directly to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–expressing tumor cells, where it
is released intracellularly and causes apoptosis.1 Similar to trastuzumab, T-DM1 inhibits cell signaling through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway, inhibits HER2 shedding, and induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity.2,3
Results were recently reported from the randomized phase 3 EMILIA study (TDM4370g/BO21977; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00829166) comparing T-DM1 with capecitabine plus lapatinib for patients with HER2positive, locally advanced (LABC) or metastatic breast cancer (MBC) previously treated with a taxane and trastuzumab.
Patients who were treated with T-DM1 had significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS; 9.6 months versus 6.4
months; hazard ratio [HR] 5 0.65; P < .001) and overall survival (OS; 30.9 months versus 25.1 months; HR 5 0.68;

P < .001), as well as fewer adverse events of grade 3 or
greater, compared with those treated with capecitabine
and lapatinib: 41% (95% confidence interval
[CI] 5 37%-45%) versus 57% (95% CI 5 53%-61%).4
Based on these results, the US Food and Drug Administration recently approved T-DM1 for the treatment of
HER2-positive MBC previously treated with trastuzumab
and taxane chemotherapy.
Despite the demonstrated activity and favorable
safety profile associated with T-DM1, it is important to
ensure that improved clinical outcomes do not come at
the expense of a patient’s symptom burden. Patientreported outcomes (PROs) provide a means of evaluating
the subjective effect treatments have on patients and their
quality of life (QOL).5 It is also important to understand
the profile of adverse events from the patient’s perspective.
Basch et al demonstrated that the incidence and severity
of adverse events, as reported by investigators in clinical
trials, can differ from reports of adverse events provided
by patients.6,7 This difference can be particularly evident
in cases of subjective adverse events, such as fatigue.
PRO data have been reported from 2 previous phase
2 studies of single-agent T-DM1 administered once every
3 weeks (q3w). In TDM4374g, an open-label study of
T-DM1 in patients with pretreated HER2-positive MBC
(median of 7 prior agents for metastatic disease), PRO
data suggested that T-DM1 is well tolerated and that
treatment with T-DM1 does not increase symptom burden.8 In addition, in the randomized phase 2 study
Cancer

TDM4450g, the favorable safety profile associated with
T-DM1 appeared to translate into superior overall QOL
versus first-line treatment with trastuzumab and docetaxel.9 To obtain a better understanding of PROs with
T-DM1, a secondary endpoint of the pivotal phase 3
EMILIA study was patient-reported time to symptom
worsening. Here, we report the results of an EMILIA
QOL analysis to evaluate the impact of T-DM1 and capecitabine plus lapatinib on PROs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

In the EMILIA study, patients with HER2-positive, unresectable LABC or MBC, who were previously treated with
trastuzumab and a taxane, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio
to T-DM1 (3.6 mg/kg intravenously q3w) or capecitabine
(1000 mg/m2 orally [po] twice a day, on days 1 through
14 of a q3w cycle) plus lapatinib (1250 mg po daily) until
disease progression (PD) or unmanageable toxicity
(Fig. 1). The study design and patient characteristics have
been reported.4 Patients provided written informed consent; the study was approved by the relevant institutional
review board and/or independent ethics committee at
each study site.
PRO Assessments

Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Breast
(FACT-B) is a 37-item questionnaire with a 7-day recall
period composed of 5 subscales that measure physical,
643

Original Article

functional, social, and emotional well-being, as well as
breast cancer–related symptoms. Female patients were
asked to complete the FACT-B on day 1 of cycle 1 and
every second cycle thereafter until 6 weeks after PD (or at
the time of tumor assessment for patients who discontinued study treatment for reasons other than PD). The
FACT-B was also given at the study drug completion visit
and every 3 months thereafter at survival follow-up visits
(Fig. 1).
The FACT-B Trial Outcome Index Physical/Functional/Breast (TOI-PFB) is a 23-item subset of the
FACT-B that can be used as a summary measure of physical and functional well-being in patients with breast cancer.10 Scores range from 0 to 92 points; a higher score
indicates a better QOL. A change of  5 points is considered clinically meaningful (ie, patients would have experienced clinically significant changes in health-related
well-being).10-12 On this basis, the primary PRO endpoint
in EMILIA was the time to symptom worsening as measured by the FACT-B TOI-PFB, which was defined as the
time from randomization to the first documentation of a
decrease of  5 points from baseline.
Predefined exploratory PRO endpoints in EMILIA
included 1) the proportion of patients with a clinically significant improvement in symptoms between the 2 treatment arms as measured by the FACT-B TOI-PFB and 2)
the proportion of patients with diarrhea symptoms as
measured by the Diarrhea Assessment Scale (DAS). A
patient was considered to have a clinically significant
improvement in TOI-PFB score if the patient had at least
one 5-point postbaseline increase in TOI-PFB score compared with baseline. The DAS is a 4-item questionnaire
designed to evaluate the frequency, urgency, consistency,
and discomfort of diarrhea experienced by a patient on a
4-point scale13,14 with a 7-day recall period. The DAS was
administered on day 1 of each cycle before the final analysis of PFS, after which the DAS was no longer administered. The incidence of each of the 4 diarrhea symptoms
was calculated for both treatment arms at baseline and for
each cycle in female patients with a baseline and  1
follow-up assessment.
Ad hoc exploratory (hypothesis-generating) PRO
analyses included an evaluation of mean changes from
baseline between treatment arms on the FACT-B physical
well-being (PWB) subscale. The PWB subscale of the
FACT-B contains 7 questions (scale 0 to 4) that measure
physical symptoms related to adverse events. A difference
of 5% of the scale range, or 0.25, is considered clinically
meaningful, based on findings from published studies of
minimally important differences in cancer scales.12,15

Statistical Analyses

For the primary PRO analysis, time to symptom worsening
was assessed by Kaplan-Meier methods and a Cox model in
female patients with baseline and  1 postbaseline
TOI-PFB score, stratified by world region (United States,
Western Europe, other); number of prior chemotherapeutic
regimens for unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic
disease (0-1 versus > 1); and visceral versus nonvisceral
disease. Two sensitivity analyses were performed for the
primary analysis. In the first sensitivity analysis, symptom
worsening that occurred after 1 or more missing assessments
was backdated to the last nonmissing TOI-PFB assessment
date plus 1 to assess the effect of missing assessments on the
results. In the second sensitivity analysis, the date of symptom worsening was backdated by 6 weeks to assess the
impact of the potential bias due to delayed reporting of
symptom worsening. Log-rank P values were calculated,
and the 95% CI for the median was computed using the
method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.16
Descriptive statistics (mean, standard error, minimum, and maximum) were used to evaluate the change
from baseline in FACT-B TOI-PFB scores for each visit
by treatment arm. In addition, a mixed-effects repeated
measure model17 was used to evaluate the change from
baseline in FACT-B TOI-PFB scores. Change from baseline in TOI-PFB score was the response variable; treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction terms were
the fixed effects; baseline TOI-PFB score was the covariate; and within-subject correlation was modeled with a
compound symmetry covariance structure. The treatment
effects at week 12, 24, 36, and study drug termination visits were compared between the 2 treatment arms with the
least-squares t tests in the mixed-effects model.
The proportion of patients with a clinically significant improvement in TOI-PFB score in each treatment
arm was estimated with 95% CIs calculated by using the
Blyth-Still-Casella method.18,19 Treatment arms were
compared, and a P value was computed using the stratified Mantel-Haenszel chi-squared test.20 For the DAS,
summary statistics (frequency and proportion) by
collapsed categories were used. Differences in the proportion of patients with moderate to severe diarrhea between
treatment arms and 95% CIs were calculated.
In an ad hoc exploratory analysis, a repeated measure
mixed-effects model17 was used to estimate least squares
means of change from baseline PWB sub-item scores.
Treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction were
fixed effects; baseline score was a covariate; and withinsubject correlation was modeled with a compound
symmetry covariance structure.

The compliance rates of TOI-PFB reporting were
summarized by each visit. The compliance rates were calculated as the ratio of the number of patients with nonmissing
TOI scores divided by the number of patients expected to
complete the FACT-B questionnaire as per the protocol.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

In total, 991 patients were randomized to the
capecitabine-plus-lapatinib (n 5 496) and the T-DM1
(n 5 495) arms, respectively. Baseline demographics and
disease characteristics were balanced between treatment
arms.4 A total of 895 of 986 female patients had a baseline
and  1 postbaseline TOI-PFB score, comprising 445 of
496 patients in the capecitabine-plus-lapatinib arm and
450 of 495 patients in the T-DM1 arm.
Compliance With Completion of TOI-PFB
Questionnaire

The completion rates of TOI-PFB were 93.8% and
89.3% at week 6 in the T-DM1 and capecitabine-pluslapatinib arms, respectively. The completion rates for the
T-DM1 arm were consistently higher than those reported
in the capecitabine-plus-lapatinib arm at all time points
except week 30. Thereafter, completion rates gradually
declined to 71.4% and 70.0%, respectively, at week 48.
Completion rates at the study drug completion visit were
80.2% in the T-DM1 arm and 70.9% in the
capecitabine-plus-lapatinib arm. Completion rates were
lower during the survival follow-up period (after study
drug discontinuation) and declined gradually at each
3-month period: 50.3% and 48.0% for T-DM1 and capecitabine plus lapatinib, respectively, at month 3, to 22.6%
and 12.9%, respectively, at month 12 (Table 1).

Primary Analysis: Time to Symptom Worsening

Of the 450 patients in the T-DM1 arm and 445 patients in
the capecitabine-plus-lapatinib arm who were eligible for
the analysis of time to symptom worsening, 246 patients
(54.7%) and 257 patients (57.8%), respectively, had worsening of symptoms. Median time to symptom worsening,
as measured by the FACT-B TOI-PFB, was longer in
the T-DM1 arm compared with the capecitabine-pluslapatinib arm (7.1 months versus 4.6 months; HR 5 0.796,
95% CI 5 0.667-0.951; P 5 .0121, based on the stratified
analysis) (Fig. 2).4 The results of an unstratified analysis
were consistent with these findings (data not shown).
In addition, the results of 2 sensitivity analyses also
demonstrated an increase in the median time to symptom worsening for patients who received T-DM1 comCancer

pared with patients who received capecitabine plus

impact of missing assessments resulted in a median time
to symptom worsening of 6.0 months for the T-DM1
arm versus 4.3 months for the capecitabine-pluslapatinib arm (HR 5 0.788, 95% CI 5 0.660-0.941;

the impact of potential bias caused by delayed reporting
of symptom worsening resulted in 6.6 months versus
4.2 months, respectively (HR 5 0.820, 95%
CI 5 0.686-0.979; P 5 .0286; stratified analysis). These
results are consistent with and support those observed in
the primary analysis.
Predefined Exploratory Analyses

A descriptive summary of mean changes in FACT-B
TOI-PFB scores from baseline per visit is shown in Figure
3. In both arms, the average postbaseline TOI-PFB scores
were slightly higher than baseline scores for visits before
study drug termination but lower for visits after study
drug termination. Patients in the T-DM1 arm reported
more favorable TOI-PFB score changes compared with
those in the capecitabine-plus-lapatinib arm for all but
2 visits (week 48 on study drug and month 12 after study
drug termination). The repeated measure mixed-effects
model analysis showed a mean difference in TOI-PFB of
1.30 points (95% CI 5 20.15 to 2.74; P 5 .0783) at
week 12; 0.86 points (95% CI 5 20.83 to 2.55;
P 5 .3195) at week 24; 1.28 points (95% CI 5 20.67 to
3.15; P 5 .2023) at week 36; and 1.07 points (95%
CI 5 20.59 to 2.73; P 5 .2068) at the drug termination
visit, which all numerically favored T-DM1. In the
646

mixed-effects model, the main effect of time and interaction effect of time by treatment were both statistically significant (P < .0001 and P 5 .0302, respectively).
In the T-DM1 arm, 55.3% of patients (249 of 450;
95% CI 5 50.7%-60.0%) had a clinically significant
improvement in symptoms from baseline compared with
49.4% of patients in the capecitabine-plus-lapatinib arm
(220 of 445; 95% CI 5 44.7%-54.2%; P 5 .0842, based
on a stratified analysis).
Although similar at baseline, the number of patients
reporting diarrhea symptoms increased 1.5- to 2-fold during treatment in the capecitabine-plus-lapatinib arm,
whereas the number reporting diarrhea symptoms
remained near baseline levels in the T-DM1 arm (Fig. 4).
At cycle 2, more patients in the capecitabine-pluslapatinib arm versus the T-DM1 arm had more than 1
stool per day (60.5% versus 31.7%), had unformed stools
(75.1% versus 39.5%), developed urgency (60.2% versus
27.5%), and had abdominal discomfort (51.0% versus
27.3%).

patients in the capecitabine-plus-lapatinib arm through
week 24 (Fig. 5). T-DM1 also showed some benefit in all
of the other items, although the differences were neither
statistically nor clinically significant (Fig. 6).
DISCUSSION
Treatment of patients with MBC is often declared to be
palliative in intent. Although studies of novel agents aim
to show improvement in clinical outcomes, such as PFS
and OS, rarely are improvements in symptoms or delays
in symptom deterioration recorded in the context of phase
3 clinical trials. Initially reported PRO results from phase
2 studies8,9 are now validated in the phase 3 EMILIA trial.
Here, we show that the safety and efficacy benefit of TDM1 over standard-of-care combination chemotherapy
and HER2-directed therapy, which itself has manageable
toxicity, is accompanied by superior PROs. T-DM1 treatment resulted in a statistically significant delay in clinically meaningful symptom worsening (as measured by the
first  5-point decrease from baseline in the TOI-PFB)
compared with capecitabine plus lapatinib (7.1 months
versus 4.6 months; HR 5 0.796; P 5 .0121).
Cancer

PROs are becoming increasingly important for evaluating novel therapeutics in MBC, yet most studies have
failed to demonstrate an appreciable difference between
standard-of-care therapy and experimental agents.21-23
Treatment with T-DM1 in EMILIA showed a statistically
significant delay in symptom worsening and more favorable mean changes from baseline in TOI-PFB scores for
almost all visits compared with treatment with capecitabine plus lapatinib. These differences were also reported
when T-DM1 was compared with a different standard
chemotherapy and HER2-directed combination, docetaxel and trastuzumab, in the randomized phase 2 study
TDM4450g.9 In the TDM4450g study, the time to
a  5-point decrease in TOI-PFB score was significantly
delayed in the T-DM1 arm, from a median of 3.5 months
in the trastuzumab-plus-docetaxel arm to 7.5 months in
the T-DM1 arm (HR 5 0.58, 95% CI 5 0.36-0.92;
P 5 .022), and the mean changes from baseline in TOIPFB scores were more favorable in the T-DM1 arm across
all treatment cycles.9 Improved QOL, illustrated by the
superior PRO results for patients treated with T-DM1
shown in these 2 studies, is assumed to be because of the

unique dual mechanism of action of T-DM1 as an ADC;
namely, the direct delivery of the cytotoxic agent DM1 to
HER2-overexpressing cells combined with the specific
antitumor activity of the trastuzumab portion of T-DM1.
This innovative treatment approach may reduce systemic
cytotoxic agent exposure and adverse events while also
improving efficacy, especially compared with standard-ofcare chemotherapy.
In the EMILIA study, results from predefined exploratory analyses also showed T-DM1 to be more favorable than capecitabine plus lapatinib in terms of its impact
on some health outcomes, including fewer diarrhea symp648

toms (as assessed by the DAS). There was a trend favoring
T-DM1 compared with capecitabine and lapatinib with
regard to a clinically significant improvement in symptoms (55.3% versus 49.4%; P 5 .0842). In addition, the
results of the ad hoc exploratory analysis found that
patients treated with T-DM1 were less bothered by side
effects (as assessed by the FACT-B PWB subscale) compared with those who received capecitabine plus lapatinib.
These results may be due, in part, to the fact that adverse
events associated with T-DM1 were primarily laboratory
abnormalities not associated with symptom deterioration,
such as thrombocytopenia or elevated liver enzyme

concentrations. In contrast, adverse events associated with
capecitabine plus lapatinib were more likely to have physical manifestations, such as diarrhea and palmar–plantar
erythrodysesthesia.4
Strengths of this PRO analysis include the fact that
time to symptom worsening was a predefined secondary
endpoint of the EMILIA study and several exploratory
PRO analyses were defined a priori. Compliance with the
TOI-PFB questionnaire was moderately high across all
scheduled time points, and sensitivity analyses evaluating
the impact of missed or delayed assessments support the
main findings. Potential limitations in the design of the
PRO analyses should be considered when interpreting the
results, such as the open-label nature of the study, which
could have led to reporting bias. In addition, missing data
handling is a well-known challenge in PRO analysis.24
The assumption that the missing data were missing at random in the PRO analysis may be violated, and bias could
occur as a result. The data analysis in this article was conducted under the assumption that the missing data were
ignorable (ie, missing at random or completely random)
and should be interpreted with caution when nonignorable missing data are present. In reality, it cannot be ruled
out that nonignorable missing data may exist. As discussed by Siddiqui et al,25 the mixed-model approach is
robust as long as the proportion of nonignorable missing
data is reasonably small. The relatively high compliance
rates observed in this study support the use of the mixedmodel approach. Finally, in this study, PRO reporting
occurred on day 1 of each cycle, and the results may have
varied if a different reporting timeline was used. The dosing schedule and pharmacokinetics of the study drugs are
not the same, and therefore symptoms may be experienced at different time points in the treatment cycle,
which may have affected the results.
Complementary to the results of the PRO analyses
reported here are the results from other QOL-related analyses, which were designed to determine which treatmentrelated functional domains or symptoms matter most to
patients or which adverse event patients most want to
avoid. For example, a stated-preference (SP) instrument
incorporating all functional domains and symptoms of
the European Organization for Research and Treatment
of Cancer QOL Questionnaire was administered to 150
patients with breast cancer who had previously experienced chemotherapy.26 The SP survey asked patients to
choose between a series of hypothetical functional/symptom pairs defined by combinations of health-related QOL
characteristics. The 4 treatment effects that these patients
most wished to avoid were nausea, vomiting, pain, and
650

decreases in emotional and role functioning. Interestingly,
in an online survey in which 551 respondents with MBC
answered questions related to treatment decisions, the
number of regimens patients received did not relate to
their preference for future treatment.27 Furthermore,
when choosing hypothetical treatments in the survey, in
addition to treatment benefit, patients preferred treatments that did not cause alopecia. The information gathered from these SP questionnaires may facilitate
discussion and encourage consideration of patient preferences in decisions about treatment selection and could be
used by clinical trial investigators to design more precise
interventions to improve health-related QOL in those
domains considered to be most important by patients.
Together with the EMILIA primary results, these
PRO data support the concept that the ADC T-DM1 has
greater efficacy and tolerability than capecitabine plus
lapatinib, which translates into improvements in healthrelated QOL.
