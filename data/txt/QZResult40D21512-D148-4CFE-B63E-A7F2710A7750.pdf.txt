Abstract
Current classification of breast cancers depends in great part on the expression of human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, and estrogen receptor (ER), the
nuclear receptor for estrogen. In addition to reliable biomarkers, these receptors are targets of effective
and widely used antitumor drugs. During malignant progression, HER2 and ER can establish an intricate
cross-talk. In some cases, HER2 overexpression leads to the downregulation of ER and undermining of
anti-ER therapies. A subgroup of HER2-positive breast cancer patients with poor prognosis expresses a
heterogeneous collection of HER2 carboxy-terminal fragments (CTF) collectively known as p95HER2.
One of these fragments, 611-CTF, is oncogenic in a variety of preclinical models. However, because of
the lack of an appropriate tool to specifically analyze its levels in the clinical setting, the value of 611CTF as a biomarker has not been established yet. Here, we show that 611-CTF induces resistance to antiestrogen therapy and a more pronounced down-modulation of ER than that induced by full-length HER2.
To validate this effect in breast cancer samples, we developed specific anti–611-CTF antibodies. With these
antibodies, we showed that, whereas the frequency of ER positivity in HER2-positive/611-CTF–negative tumors (72.6%) is similar to that reported for HER2-negative tumors (70–80%), the number of ER-positive
tumors in the 611-CTF–positive subgroup is very low (31.2%). These results reveal a mechanism of ER
regulation mediated by HER2, which suggests a new strategy to improve responses to endocrine therapy
in breast cancer. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8537–46. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease; analysis of gene
expression profiles has shown the existence of at least five
types of breast cancers with different prognoses (1). However, in practical terms and because gene expression profiles
are not routinely performed, the classification of breast cancer depends in great part on the expression of two receptors:
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a tyrosine
kinase that belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) family, and estrogen receptor (ER), the nuclear recepAuthors' Affiliations: 1Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology; 2Statistics

tor for the steroid hormone estrogen. These receptors are not
only useful in the classification of breast cancers but they are
also targets of effective antitumor drugs (2, 3).
HER2 becomes active on homodimerization or heterodimerization with other members of the EGFR family. Activated
HER2 transduces intracellular signals through phosphorylation cascades that, in turn, regulate the expression of genes
that coordinately control cell differentiation, proliferation,
death, adhesion, and migration (4). HER2 expression is elevated in 20–30% of breast cancers. These tumors are currently
treated with herceptin, a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of HER2, and/or lapatinib, a small molecule that inhibits its tyrosine kinase activity (2).
Estrogen is a central regulator of normal female physiology; however, because it promotes cell proliferation and survival, continuous exposure to endogenous or exogenous
estrogen may cause breast cancer (5). Estrogen binds and
activates two nuclear receptors, ERα and ERβ. ERα (hereafter called ER) mediates several of the effects of estrogen on
normal and cancerous breast tissue by directly regulating
the transcription of many genes (genomic actions) and by
participating in cytoplasmic signaling cascades (nongenomic
actions; ref. 6). Current endocrine therapies targeting estrogen include antiestrogens that bind ER, such as tamoxifen,

and aromatase inhibitors, which interfere with the synthesis
of estrogen (7).
The HER2 and ER signaling pathways establish intricate
connections during the progression of breast cancer (reviewed
in ref. 8). Activation of HER2 or related receptors downmodulates the ER through the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, which, in turn, leads to
phosphorylation and negative regulation of FOXO3a (9, 10).
This transcription factor controls the expression of ER in
breast cancer cells (11). Additional mechanisms may include
the upregulation of microRNA-206, which targets the ER
mRNA (12), and the activation of mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) and NF-κB pathways (13). The down-modulation
of ER by HER2 oversignaling likely explains the relative low
percentage of HER2-overexpressing patients that express
ER (∼50%) compared with the percentage of HER2-negative
patients that express the nuclear receptor (70–80%; ref. 14).
From a therapeutic point of view, overactivation of HER2
or its downstream effectors MAPK and PI3K elicits resistance
to tamoxifen (15). One of the mechanisms proposed is the
down-modulation of ER expression by HER2 signaling. In addition, HER2 can lead to activation of ER by phosphorylation
in the absence of ER ligands and to the generation of mitogenic signals independent of ER ligands (reviewed in refs. 16, 17).
Approximately 30% of HER2-positive patients express a
variety of receptor fragments of 90 to 115 kDa, collectively
known as p95HER2 of carboxy-terminal fragments (CTF;
refs. 18, 19). p95HER2/CTFs are generated by at least two mechanisms, proteolytic shedding of the extracellular domain
(18, 20) and alternative initiation of translation from internal
AUG codons (21). Compared with tumors expressing only the
full-length receptor, p95HER2-positive tumors have worse
prognosis (19); they are more likely to metastasize (22),
and they are resistant to treatment with herceptin (23).
Whereas several p95HER2/CTFs are inactive, one of them,
generated by alternative initiation of translation from the
AUG codon at position 611 (611-CTF), is an oncogenic form
of HER2 that drives breast cancer progression in vivo (24).
The hyperactivity of this fragment depends on its ability to
constitutively dimerize through intermolecular disulfide
bonds (24). Thus, 611-CTF is likely causally involved in the
progression of p95HER2-positive tumors.
Despite its likelihood, the functional interaction between
611-CTF and ER has not been analyzed to date. Here, we show
that 611-CTF expression results in down-modulation of ER
and confers resistance to antiestrogen treatment in cultured
breast cancer cells. To confirm this down-modulation in the
clinical setting, we developed specific antibodies as a tool to
detect 611-CTF in breast cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry. This was possible because of the existence of epitopes exposed in 611-CTF but masked in full-length HER2.
Using these antibodies, we showed that 611-CTF is present
in the majority of samples classified as p95HER2-positive by
Western blot. Supporting the results with cultured cells,
we showed that only 31.2% of breast tumors expressing
611-CTF expressed ER. In contrast, the percentage of tumors
expressing ER and HER2, but not 611-CTF, was 72.6%, similar to the percentage of HER2-negative tumors expressing

ER. These results show the importance of 611-CTF in the
downregulation of ER in HER2-positive tumors and illustrate
the usefulness of the anti–611-CTF antibodies to conduct
translational research.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, animal studies, and tissue samples
All the cells used in this study were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were cultured for fewer
than 6 months after receipt. The generation and characterization of MCF7 Tet-Off (BD Biosciences) transfected with
full-length HER2, 611-CTF, and 648-CTF have been recently
published (25). Cells were obtained from BD Biosciences, cultured and maintained in DMEM/Ham F12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
(Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C in 5% CO2.
Tumor xenografts in nude mice
Mice were maintained and treated in accordance with institutional guidelines of Vall d'Hebron University Hospital
Care and Use Committee. MCF7 Tet-Off cells, transfected
with the cDNA encoding 611-CTF under the control of a
Tet/Dox-responsive element, were injected into the right
flanks of 6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c athymic mice purchased from Charles Rivers Laboratories. The expression of
611-CTF was repressed by adding doxycycline (1 g/L) to
the drinking water until tumors were ∼200 mm3. Then mice
were randomized and treated with or without doxycycline
(1 g/L) or tamoxifen (26 mg/L) freshly prepared daily and
given via drinking water. Tumor xenografts were measured
with calipers every 3 days, and tumor volume was determined
using the formula: (length × width2) × (π/6). At the end of the
experiment, the animals were anesthetized with a 1.5%
isofluorane-air mixture and were killed by cervical dislocation. Results are presented as mean ± SD of tumor volume.
Breast tumors used in this study were from surgical resections at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital and were obtained
following the institutional guidelines. Written informed consent for the performance of tumor molecular studies was obtained from all patients who provided tissue.
Plasmids and reagents
Expression vectors for 611-CTF, 613-CTF, and 616-CTF were
made by cloning HindIII-EcoRI PCR products into pCDNA3.1(+).
Lapatinib (Tykerb) was provided by GlaxoSmithKline.
Antibodies
Antibodies were from BioGenex [anti-HER2 (CB11)], Thermo Scientific [anti-ERα, Ab-10 (clone TE111.5D11) antibody,
anti–progesterone receptor (PR), Ab-8 (hPRa2 + hPRa3)],
Invitrogen (Alexa Fluor 488), GE Healthcare (ECL antimouse
IgG, ECL antimouse IgG), and Novocastra [anti-ER (NCL-LER-6F11) and anti-PR (RTU-PGR-AB)].

peptide with the 32 NH2 terminal amino acids of 611-CTF
(MPIWKFPDEEGASQPSPINSTHSSVDLDDKGC) was used to
immunize four New Zealand white rabbits, which were injected three times in a period of 3 months. To avoid nonspecific conjugation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin, the four
cysteines in the middle of the peptide sequence of HER2 were
replaced by serines. After the animal exsanguinations, the
immunized serum was purified on a protein A column.
Monoclonal antibodies. The monoclonal antibodies were
generated by the biotechnology company Abyntek using the
same peptide as the one used to generate the polyclonal
antibodies.
Western blot
Extracts for immunoblots were prepared in modified
radioimmunoprecipitation buffer [20 mmol/L NaH2 PO 4 /
NaOH (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100,
5 mmol/L EDTA, 100 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
25 mmol/L NaF, 16 μg/mL aprotinin, 10 μg/mL leupeptin,
and 1.3 mmol/L Na3VO4]. Protein concentrations were determined with detergent-compatible protein assay reagents
(Bio-Rad). Samples were mixed with loading buffer [final
concentrations, 62 mmol/L Tris (pH 6.8), 12% glycerol,
2.5% SDS] with 5% β-mercaptoethanol and incubated at
99°C for 5 minutes before fractionation of 15 μg of protein
by SDS-PAGE. Where appropriate, signals in Western blots
were quantified with the software ImageJ 1.38 (NIH). All experiments were repeated three times.
Immunoprecipitation
Cell lysates were incubated with different antibodies during 1 hour at 4°C. Then immunocomplexes were purified
with protein A. Immunoprecipitates were washed three
times with lysis buffer, mixed with loading buffer, and analyzed by Western blot. The experiments were repeated
three times.
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Cells seeded on glass coverslips were washed with PBS,
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes. Cells
were blocked (1 hour) and incubated (1 hour) with mouse
monoclonal anti-HER2 CB11 (1:100), 32H2 (2 μg/μL), and
20F4 (20 μg/μL) [in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)] plus
0.1% saponin in PBS (0.025 mol/L Na2HPO4, 0.025 mol/L
K2PO4 in 0.87% of NaCl). Cells were then washed three
times with PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated Alexa
Fluor 488 secondary antibody (1:1,000) in 1% BSA/PBS for
45 minutes. Cells were then washed three times with PBS,
mounted in Vectashield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole,
and visualized by fluorescence or confocal microscopy. All
procedures were performed at room temperature. All experiments were repeated three times.
Flow cytometry
MCF7 cells expressing HER2, 611-CTF, or 648-CTF were
washed at 4°C with PBS and detached in PBS containing

www.aacrjournals.org

10 mmol/L of EDTA. Detached cells were incubated with
10 μg/mL of anti-32H2 monoclonal antibody in PBS containing 5% BSA for 30 minutes at 4°C and washed and stained for
30 minutes at 4°C with FITC-conjugated antimouse IgG
(Becton Dickinson) in PBS containing 5% BSA. Flow cytometry was done on a FACScan using FACScan research software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems).
Immunhistochemistry and evaluation
For a tumor cell to get a positive score, membrane staining
was required for both c-erbB2 and 611-CTF. HER2 expression
was detected with two different tests, the Food and Drug
Administration–approved HercepTest kit (polyclonal rabbit
antibody, DAKO) and the monoclonal antibody anti–c-erbB2
CB11. 611-CTF expression was detected using the 32H2 antibody in a concentration of 20 μg/mL. After boiling the sections in an autoclave in citrate buffer (pH 7.8), the Envision
System (DAKO) was used, for all three antibodies, to visualize
immunostaining. In these samples, HER2 expression was
scored exactly as described for the Food and Drugs Administration–approved HercepTest in four categories: 0, 1+, 2+,
and 3+. Scores of below 2+ were considered as negatives,
and scores of 3+ were considered as positives. In scores of
2+, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed to verify HER2 amplification. In 32H2, tumors were
scored positive when at least 10% of the tumor cells are with
complete membrane staining.
MCF7 cells expressing HER2, 611-CTF, or 648-CTF were
washed at 4°C with PBS and detached in PBS containing
5 mmol/L of EDTA. Then cells were centrifuged, and cell
pellets were fixed in 10% neutral formalin, dehydrated, and
embedded in paraffin. Sections from cell pellets or human
tissues of a thickness of 3 μm were placed on polylysinecoated glass slides. Immunohistochemical analyses were
performed using the same protocol described above. The
antibody concentration used was 20 μg/mL for 20F4 and
2 μg/mL for 32H2.
FISH for HER2/neu
FISH was done according to the PathVysion (Vysis, Inc.)
guidelines described in the package insert as approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Statistical analysis
Associations between hormone receptors, tumor size, biological activity, and 611-CTF expression in breast cancer patients were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test. Results were
considered to be statistically significant at P < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 12.0 statistical
software (SPSS, Inc.).

ER Down-modulation by HER2 Carboxy-Terminal Fragments

breast tumors (24). Due to the importance of the cross-talk
between HER2 and ER signaling during breast cancer progression and treatment, we analyzed the possible interaction
between 611-CTF and ER. As a first approach, we used MCF7
cells, a classical model, to study estrogen signaling (25),
transfected with cDNAs encoding full-length HER2 or 611CTF under the control of a promoter repressible by doxycycline (Fig. 1B; ref. 24).
As expected, induction of the expression of HER2 resulted
in down-modulation of ER as analyzed by Western blot (Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 1C). Analysis of cells expressing 611CTF showed that the expression of this hyperactive HER2
isoform resulted in a more pronounced down-modulation
of ER (Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 1C). Immunohistochemical
analysis (Fig. 1E) confirmed the Western blot results.
The expression of PR is transcriptionally regulated by ER
(26). In fact, the expression of PR is considered a reliable maker of ER activity (recently reviewed in ref. 27). Thus, to determine the functional consequences of the down-modulation of
ER induced by 611-CTF, we also analyzed the expression of
PR. As shown in Fig. 1D and E and confirming the results
with ER, the expression of 611-CTF led to down-modulation
of PR.
HER2 signaling can be specifically targeted by the small
molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib. Given the fact
that BT474 cells express high levels of HER2 and p95HER2/
CTFs (20), we hypothesized that the expression of ER should
be repressed in this cell line. Confirming this hypothesis,

treatment of BT474 cells with lapatinib, in addition to effectively block HER2 signaling as judged by the decrease in the
levels of p-Akt and p-Erk1/2, induced upregulation of the ER
(Fig. 1F).
Expression of HER2 has been shown to elicit resistance to
tamoxifen (16, 17). To analyze if 611-CTF also induces resistance to the antiestrogen, we xenografted MCF7/611-CTF
cells into nude mice (Fig. 2A). As expected, in the presence
of doxycycline, i.e., with the repressed expression of 611CTF, the growth of MCF7 cells was inhibited by tamoxifen
(Fig. 2A). Induction of the expression of 611-CTF led to the
growth of larger tumors and to the down-modulation of the
ER (Fig. 2A and B). The growth of MCF7 cells expressing
611-CTF was not inhibited by tamoxifen, showing that expression of the HER2 fragment induces resistance to the
antiestrogen. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that
expression of 611-CTF down-modulated that of ER (Fig. 2B).
The results in Figs. 1 and 2 revealed that, compared with
HER2, 611-CTF induces a profound downregulation of ER
and resistance to tamoxifen treatment, suggesting that this
HER2 fragment plays a role in the regulation of ER in breast
tumors.
Generation and characterization of antibodies
against 611-CTFs
To determine whether the down-modulation of ER caused
by the expression of 611-CTF in cultured cells also occurs
in breast cancer patients, both proteins would have to be

randomized (six mice per group) and treated with or without doxycycline (1 g/L) or tamoxifen (26 mg/L) as indicated. B, representative staining with antibodies

Figure 3. Characterization of the epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies directed against 611-CTF. A, primary sequence of the extracellular domain
of 611-CTF. The transmembrane domain is represented by a hatched box. The positions of the disulfide bonds established in the full-length molecule

used to generate monoclonal antibodies is underlined. The NH2 termini of the deletion constructs (613-CTF and 616-CTF) are shown. B, MCF7 cells
were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding the 611-CTF or the 613-CTF and 616-CTF deletion constructs. Lysates from transfected cells were

peptide corresponding to the NH2 terminus of 611-CTF (see A).

analyzed in a large series of human HER2-positive samples.
Whereas the determination of ER levels by immunohistochemistry is a routine technique in the clinic (28), a comparable
method to analyze the levels of 611-CTF is not currently available. Thus, we aimed to developed new antibodies specific for
611-CTF.
The extracellular juxtamembrane region of HER2 is
cysteine-rich (Fig. 3A). In the context of the full-length molecule, this region is highly structured and maintained by three
intramolecular disulfide bonds established by six cysteines
(Fig. 3A; ref. 29). In contrast, the same region is presumably
unstructured and sterically more accessible in 611-CTF.
Therefore, we hypothesized that the extracellular juxtamembrane domains of HER2 and 611-CTF are antigenically distinct and hence the existence of epitopes exposed at the
NH2 terminus of 611-CTF while masked in full-length HER2.
To test this hypothesis, we generated a rabbit polyclonal
antibody against a peptide corresponding to the 32 NH2 terminal amino acids of 611-CTF (Fig. 3A). This antibody recognized both full-length HER2 and 611-CTF by Western blot
(i.e., under denaturing and reducing conditions; Supplementary Fig. S2). However, further characterization showed the
existence of epitope(s) exposed under native conditions only
in 611-CTF, as analyzed by immunoprecipitation and indirect
immunofluorescence microscopy (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Next, we generated and characterized several mouse
monoclonal antibodies against the same peptide; for simplicity, we will only present the results obtained with two
representative specific antibodies. Western blot analysis of
cells transfected with two 611-CTF NH2 terminal deletion
constructs showed that the antibodies 32H2 and 20F4 recognized overlapping but distinct epitopes. Deletion of proline 612 completely prevented and did not affect the
recognition of 611-CTF by 32H2 and 20F4, respectively
(Fig. 3A and B), whereas the binding of 20F4 was abolished
by deletion of the first five amino acids of the HER2 fragment (Fig. 3A and B).
As expected both antibodies bound to denatured and reduced HER2 in Western blots (Fig. 4A). As a negative con-

8542

Cancer Res; 70(21) November 1, 2010

trol, we used cells expressing 648-CTF (Fig. 4A), a fragment
that lacks the peptide sequence against which the antibodies were raised (Fig. 1A). Importantly, both antibodies
showed a strong preference for 611-CTF over HER2 when
assayed by immununoprecipitation (Fig. 4B), indirect
inmuofluorescence (Fig. 4C), flow cytometry (Fig. 4D; Supplementary Fig. S3), and immunohistochemistry on formalin-fixed paraffin sections (Fig. 4E). These results confirmed
that the antibodies generated are a useful tool to specifically detect the presence of 611-CTF using a variety of techniques, including immunohistochemistry, a commonly used
technique in the clinical setting. We chose the antibody
32H2 for further experiments because it showed a better
performance than that of 20F4 by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4).
611-CTF levels in p95HER2-positive tumors
HER2-positive breast cancers expressing p95HER2 have
worse prognosis and are more likely to metastasize compared with those expressing only the full-length receptor
(19, 22). This suggests that p95HER2 is causally involved in
the progression of a subgroup of breast cancers. p95HER2
is a heterogeneous series of HER2 fragments that includes
soluble as well as transmembrane fragments (21). Among
these fragments, only 611-CTF seems to be hyperactive
(24). Thus, it seemed reasonable to hypothesize that the majority of p95HER2-positive patients express 611-CTF. To test
this and to further characterize the 32H2 antibody against
611-CTF, we analyzed the levels of this fragment by immunohistochemistry in a series of 35 HER2-positive samples previously analyzed for the presence of p95HER2 by Western blot
(Fig. 5; Table 1; ref. 23).
As shown in Table 1, the majority (90.5%) of p95HER2positive samples, as judged by Western blot, expressed 611CTF as judged by immunohistochemistry with the 32H2
antibody (Fig. 4A and Table 1). Only 2 of 21 samples were
positive by Western blot but negative by immunohistochemistry, and only 1 of 14 samples was negative by Western blot
but stained positively with the 32H2 antibody (Table 1). Thus,

for the majority of samples, detection of p95HER2 fragments
by Western blotting coincides with the expression of 611-CTF.
Next, using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed an independent collection of 56 formalin-fixed paraffin sections of
breast tumors for which the lymph node status at the time

of resection was available. In agreement with the previous
reports on the value of p95HER2 as a maker of bad prognosis
and metastasis (19, 22) and with the fact that 611-CTF is a
component of p95HER2 in the majority of samples, we found
that 611-CTF–positive patients also had a higher risk of

this fragment may play a causal role in the progression of
breast cancers expressing p95HER2.
Expression of 611-CTF, but not of HER2, inversely
correlates with ER
Early reports showing that the expressions of ER and HER2
tend to be inversely correlated (30) have been confirmed recently. Whereas nearly 80% of HER2-negative breast tumors
are positive for ER, only ∼50% of HER2-positive breast tumors are ER positive (14).
To analyze the possible relationship between 611-CTF and
ER expression in human breast cancers, we analyzed the
expression of ER in a new cohort of 83 HER2-positive pa-

tients classified according to the expression of 611-CTF as
judged by immunohistochemistry with the 32H2 antibody
(Table 2). In agreement with the published studies, 56.6%
of the samples expressed detectable levels of ER. However,
in the 611-CTF–positive subgroup, only 31.2% of the samples
expressed ER (Table 2). Notably, the percentage of ER-positive samples in patients expressing HER2, but not 611-CTF
(72.6%, Table 2), did not differ significantly (exact binomial
test, P = 0.313) from that reported for HER2-negative patients
(78.2%) in a large series of samples (14). These results show
that the expression of 611-CTF is inversely correlated with
the expression of ER and indicate that 611-CTF plays a major
role in the down-modulation of ER in HER2-positive patients.
Approximately 50% of HER2-positive patients express PR
(14). In agreement with this result, 47% of the HER2-positive
patients analyzed here were PR positive (Table 2). As expected, given the fact that ER promotes the expression of
PR, among 611-CTF–positive patients, expression of PR
was less frequent (25.0%). In a clear parallelism with the
percentages observed for ER, the percentage of PR positivity
in the group of patients positive for HER2 but negative for
611-CTF (60.8%) is clearly higher than in the group of 611CTF–expressing patients.
These results confirm that 611-CTF plays a major role in
the regulation of the ER expression and open the possibility that expression of this HER2 fragment conditions the
response to endocrine therapy.

resistance to treatment with herceptin (19, 22, 23). Initially,
p95HER2 was assumed to arise through the proteolytic processing of full-length HER2 by metalloproteases (18, 31, 32).
In fact, it was named after the theoretical molecular size of
the cell-associated fragment generated by proteolytic shedding of the ectodomain of HER2. Following this assumption
and because the molecular weight of proteins varies with
cell-specific posttranslational modifications, samples from
breast tumors analyzed by Western blot were classified as
p95HER2-positive if immunoreactivity was detected in the
90 to 115 kDa region. Additional fragments arise through
proteolytic cleavage of the intracellular domain of HER2
by caspases (33) and calpains (34). However, the molecular
size of these fragments is <50 kDa (33, 34), and therefore,
they have not been considered within the p95HER2 group
of fragments.
In contrast to the original hypothesis, we have shown recently that, in addition to proteolytic processing, alternative
initiation of translation from different methionine codons
can generate HER2 CTFs (21). In fact, p95HER2 is a heterogeneous collection of soluble and transmembrane fragments
of different lengths (24). Whereas the soluble fragments
are inactive and may represent degradation byproducts,
one of the transmembrane fragments, 611-CTF, is hyperactive (24). Expression of 611-CTF leads to the activation of several intracellular signaling cascades, such as the MAPK, Akt,
Src, and PLCγ signal transduction pathways, and promotes
cell migration (35). In addition, expression of low levels of
611-CTF in the mammary gland of mice induces the growth
of breast tumors far more aggressive than those generated by
full-length HER2 (25). Furthermore, as shown here, 611-CTF
plays a major role in the downregulation of the ER and resistance to tamoxifen in breast cancer cells, a remarkable result
given the relevance of the interplay between the HER2 and
ER signaling pathways in breast cancer progression and
treatment. Therefore, all lines of evidence obtained with
the cultured cells and animal models point to a major role
of 611-CTF in the progression of a subgroup of HER2-positive
breast cancers.
To confirm in specimens from breast cancer patients the
down-modulation of ER by 611-CTF observed in preclinical
models, we developed a specific tool to robustly and reproducibly analyze the expression of 611-CTF. Western blot was

considered, in principle, a valid technique and has been used
by several authors (18, 20, 23). However, it requires freshfrozen tumor tissue, frequently not available. Furthermore,
to identify 611-CTF from tumor samples, the migration of
candidate bands has to be compared with that of the forms
expressed in cells transfected with a cDNA construct encoding 611-CTF. This comparison results in ambiguous conclusions when the intensity of the candidate band is not
comparable with that used as reference, frequently requiring
repetition of the analysis. Thus, although Western blot has
been a useful technique to confirm the existence of 611CTF in a limited number of samples (24), it is not appropriate for the analysis of a large series of tumors.
The development of antibodies against epitopes masked in
full-length HER2 but exposed in 611-CTF circumvented most
of the problems posed by the use of Western blot. These
antibodies allowed the detection of 611-CTF in formalinfixed paraffin-embedded sections, the most common way
to store samples from patients without the need of including
internal controls.
Once available, we used these antibodies to classify HER2
tumors as 611-CTF positive or negative. Subsequent analysis of the expression of ER and PR in these subgroups confirmed the down-modulation of ER induced by 611-CTF in
cultured cells. We showed that only a minor proportion of
611-CTF–positive tumors express ER and PR compared
with HER2-positive tumors that do not express the fragment (Table 2). These results may have implications when
tailoring a therapy for HER2-positive patients. Patients expressing 611-CTF are not likely to benefit from the treatment with monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular
domain of HER2. In contrast, small molecule inhibitors,
which block the activity of the hyperactive fragment, may
be appropriate to treat this subgroup of HER2-positive patients. Interestingly, it has been shown recently that the
small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib restores
hormone sensitivity in cells with acquired endocrine resistance (36). Because p95HER2 exerted a potent, but reversible, down-modulation of ER expression, it is likely that its
inhibition results in the upregulation of ER; thus, we propose that the p95HER2-positive subgroup of tumors may
benefit from a dual treatment with lapatinib and anti-ER
therapies.
