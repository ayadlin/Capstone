Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The main reason why tumours are not controlled by the immune system is that, unlike pathogens,
they do not express potent tumour rejection antigens (TRAs). Tumour vaccination aims at
stimulating a systemic immune response targeted to, mostly weak, antigens expressed in the
disseminated tumour lesions. Main challenges in developing effective vaccination protocols are
the identification of potent and broadly expressed TRAs1–3 and effective adjuvants to stimulate a
robust and durable immune response4–6. Here we describe an alternative approach in which the
expression of new, and thereby potent, antigens are induced in tumour cells by inhibiting
nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay (NMD)7–10. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated
inhibition of NMD in tumour cells led to the expression of new antigenic determinants and their
immune-mediated rejection. In subcutaneous and metastatic tumour models, tumour-targeted
delivery of NMD factor-specific siRNAs conjugated to oligonucleotide aptamer ligands led to
significant inhibition of tumour growth that was superior to that of vaccination with granulocyte–
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-expressing irradiated tumour cells11, and could
be further enhanced by co-stimulation. Tumour-targeted NMD inhibition forms the basis of a
simple, broadly useful, and clinically feasible approach to enhance the antigenicity of
disseminated tumours leading to their immune recognition and rejection. The cell-free chemically
synthesized oligonucleotide backbone of aptamer–siRNAs reduces the risk of immunogenicity and
enhances the feasibility of generating reagents suitable for clinical use.

Disseminated metastatic disease is the primary cause of death among cancer patients. Cancer
vaccination stimulates a systemic immune response against judiciously chosen tumour
antigens expressed in the tumour cells that seeks out and destroys the disseminated tumour
lesions. The development of effective cancer vaccines will require the identification of
potent and broadly expressed TRAs1–3 as well as effective adjuvants to stimulate a robust
and durable immune response4–6. An alternative approach to vaccination is to express new,
and hence potent, antigens in tumour cells in situ. How to express new antigens in the
disseminated tumour lesions, but not in normal tissue, have precluded the development of

such strategies so far. NMD is an evolutionarily conserved surveillance mechanism in
eukaryotic cells that prevents the expression of mRNAs containing a premature termination
codon (PTC)8–10. Inhibition of NMD in cultured human cell lines using siRNAs targeted to
any of its factors, SMG1, UPF1, UPF2 or UPF3, results in the upregulation of several
products encoded by the PTC-containing mRNAs (see, for example, refs 12–15). Many of
these products, resulting from aberrant splicing or NMD-dependent autoregulated alternative
splicing7,8,16, encode new peptides that have not induced tolerance (see Supplementary
Discussion). We proposed that the upregulation of such products when NMD is inhibited in
tumour cells will elicit an immune response against (some of) the new products, and that the
immune response will inhibit tumour growth. Moreover, there is evidence that frameshift
mutations in cancer cells exhibiting DNA mismatch repair generate PTC-containing
transcripts that are negatively controlled by NMD17. Inhibiting NMD could, therefore,
further augment the production of such tumour-specific antigens (see Supplementary
Discussion).

To determine whether NMD inhibition in tumour cells can stimulate protective anti-tumour
immunity, we tested whether the stable expression of NMD factor short hairpin RNAs
(shRNAs) in tumour cells inhibits their growth potential in mice. CT26 colon carcinoma
tumour cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector (PTIG-U6tetOshRNA) encoding Smg1
or Upf2 shRNAs expressed from a tet-regulated U6 promoter18. shRNA expression can be
upregulated in vitro by adding doxycycline to the culture medium, and in vivo by providing
doxycycline in the drinking water. Doxycycline-induced Smg1 and Upf2 shRNA expression
in cultured CT26 cells results in downregulation of the corresponding mRNA
(Supplementary Fig. 1a) and inhibition of NMD (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Long-term
inhibition of NMD, or other functions controlled by SMG1 or UPF2, had no measurable
effects on the viability or proliferative capacity of the CT26 cells in vitro (data not shown).

To determine whether siRNA inhibition of NMD in the tumour-bearing mice can stimulate
immune responses against products that are normally under NMD control, we measured the
intratumoral accumulation of T cells recognizing a model tumour antigen that is suppressed
as a result of NMD. B16/F10 tumour cells containing the doxycycline-inducible Smg1, Upf2
or control shRNA were stably transfected with an NMD reporter plasmid encoding the
dominant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I epitope of the chicken ovalbumin
gene (OVA) upstream of a PTC (diagrams in Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Tumourbearing mice were infused with OT-I transgenic CD8+ T cells that recognize the OVA MHC
class I-restricted epitope20, or with Pmel-1 transgenic CD8+ T cells that recognize an MHC
class I-restricted epitope in the endogenous gp100 tumour antigen expressed in B16 tumour
cells19. gp100 expression is not under NMD control. As shown in Fig. 1a, unlike Pmel-1 T
cells, the OT-I T cells failed to accumulate to significant levels in the OVA-negative B16/
F10 tumours or in tumours transfected with the PTC-containing β-globin-OVA construct
encoding but not expressing Smg1 or Upf2 shRNA. However, upregulation of Smg1 or Upf2
shRNA, but not control shRNA (doxycycline in the drinking water) resulted in a significant
accumulation of OT-I T cells in the tumours. This experiment shows that siRNA inhibition
of NMD in tumour cells can induce an immune response in vivo against an antigen that is
under NMD control.
To determine whether siRNA-mediated inhibition of NMD affects tumour growth, the
lentiviral-transduced CT26 cells expressing a control, Smg1 or Upf2 shRNA were implanted
subcutaneously into mice and tumour growth was monitored in the presence or absence of
doxycycline administered in the drinking water. Figure 1b shows that tumour cells
expressing Smg1 or Upf2 shRNA, but not control shRNA, grew initially but failed to
progress. Tumour inhibition was immune-mediated because the tumours grew in nude mice
(Fig. 1c), and mice that rejected the tumours shown in Fig. 1b, but not age-matched control

mice, resisted a second challenge with parental tumour cells (not shown). Delaying
doxycycline treatment of mice expressing Smg1 shRNA diminished the tumour inhibitory
effect that was completely lost when drug treatment was delayed for 6 days (Supplementary
Fig. 2). Tumour rejection correlated with the induction of T-cell responses against tumour
cells expressing Smg1 shRNA. No T-cell responses were detected against tumour cells that
did not express Smg1 shRNA or against normal tissues including liver, colon and prostate
(Supplementary Fig. 3). This is consistent with the hypothesis that tumour rejection was
mediated by the induction of immune responses against NMD-controlled products that were
upregulated when NMD was inhibited in the tumour cells.

In the experiment shown in Fig. 1b, tumour growth was completely prevented when NMD
was inhibited in all tumour cells from the time of tumour implantation. Simulating a more
relevant clinical model, we tested whether inhibition of NMD in pre-existing tumours can
induce therapeutically useful tumour immunity. To preclude NMD inhibition in normal
cells, the NMD factor siRNAs were targeted to tumour cells using oligonucleotide aptamer
ligands21,22. Smg1 and Upf2 siRNA were conjugated to an oligonucleotide aptamer that
binds to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)23 as shown in Supplementary Fig. 4.
PSMA-expressing CT26 and B16 tumour cell lines were generated by transduction with a
PSMA-encoding expression vector, and PSMA expression was confirmed by flow
cytometry (not shown). The PSMA-conjugated siRNAs bound to and were taken up by
PSMA-expressing, but not parental, tumour cells (Supplementary Fig. 5), leading to the
downregulation of their target RNAs (Supplementary Fig. 6).

We next tested whether systemic administration of PSMA aptamer–siRNA conjugates by
tail vein injection can inhibit tumour growth. As shown in Fig. 2a, treatment of day 3
subcutaneously implanted PSMA-CT26 tumour cells with PSMA-conjugated Smg1 siRNA,
and to a lesser extent Upf2 siRNA, significantly inhibited tumour growth. Two out of seven
mice treated with the PSMA aptamer–Smg1 siRNA conjugate rejected the implanted
tumours and remained tumour-free (Supplementary Fig. 7). When treatment intensity was
increased by doubling the dose of the aptamer–siRNA conjugate and extending treatment to
seven injections, six out of seven of mice rejected the tumour long term. Treatment with
PSMA aptamer conjugated to control siRNA had a small inhibitory effect that could have
resulted from the binding of the PSMA aptamer–siRNA to the tumour cells, or be due to
non-specific immune stimulatory effects of the oligonucleotide24,25. We found no increase
in IFNα levels in the serum of mice treated with PSMA aptamer–control or Smg1 siRNA
conjugates (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2b, the treatment of day 5 PSMA-B16/F10
tumour-implanted mice with PSMA aptamer-conjugated Upf2 or Smg1 siRNA inhibited the
development of lung metastasis that was more profound in the SMG1 group. To determine
whether the anti-tumour response elicited by NMD inhibition can be further enhanced by costimulation, PSMA-CT26 tumour-bearing mice were treated with PSMA aptamer–Smg1
siRNA and an agonistic 4-1BB aptamer dimer26. The stringency of NMD inhibition and
4-1BB co-stimulation was adjusted to elicit a limited anti-tumour effect when applied
separately by delaying treatment with PSMA aptamer–siRNA conjugates from days 3 to 5
and administering a single dose of 4-1BB aptamer on day 6. As shown in Fig. 2c,
combination therapy with PSMA aptamer–Smg1 siRNA and 4-1BB aptamer was more than
additive.
To determine whether tumour inhibition shown in Fig. 2 is a result of aptamer targeting of
siRNA to PSMA-expressing tumour cells, mice were implanted in opposite flanks with
PSMA-expressing and parental CT26 tumour cells and PSMA aptamer conjugated to control
or Smg1 siRNA was administered systemically by tail vein injection (Fig. 3a). Figure 3b
shows that 32P-labelled PSMA aptamer–Smg1 siRNA conjugate accumulated preferentially
in PSMA-expressing tumour cells. Figure 3c shows that systemic administration of PSMA

aptamer-conjugated Smg1, but not control, siRNA inhibited the growth of PSMA-expressing
CT26 tumour cells but not the contralaterally implanted parental CT26 tumour cells.
Supplementary Fig. 8 shows a snapshot of the tumour-bearing mice at the day of
euthanization.
To assess the potency of tumour-targeted NMD inhibition, we compared the anti-tumour
effects of treating tumour-bearing mice with PSMA aptamer–Smg1 siRNA conjugate and
vaccination with GM-CSF-expressing irradiated syngeneic tumour cells (GVAX)11,27. In
therapeutic protocols when vaccination is initiated 2–4 days after tumour inoculation, the
anti-tumour impact of GVAX is limited, unless combined with other treatments such as
CTLA-4 blockade28 or T-regulatory cell depletion29. As shown in Fig. 4, in the B16 lung
metastasis model described in Fig. 2b, GVAX treatment of day 1 tumour bearing mice
significantly inhibited metastasis, whereas treatment of day 5 tumour bearing mice had a
limited anti-metastatic effect that barely reached statistical significance. By comparison,
treatment of day-5 tumour-bearing mice with PSMA aptamer–Smg1 siRNAs inhibited
metastasis to an extent comparable to that of administering GVAX at day 1. Given that these
are first generation aptamer–siRNA conjugates and the dose and schedule of aptamer–
siRNA treatment have not been optimized, these results indicate that tumour-targeted
siRNA-mediated NMD inhibition is more effective than a commonly used vaccination
protocol.

Tumour-targeted NMD inhibition is a new approach to stimulate protective anti-tumour
immunity. Instead of stimulating or potentiating immune responses against existing, often
weak, antigens expressed in the tumour cells—the goal of current tumour vaccination
protocols—NMD inhibition generates new antigenic determinants in situ in the disseminated
tumour lesions. It should be noted that NMD control of gene expression is ‘leaky’. In
addition to the first round of translation, known as pioneer translation, the efficiency of
nonsense-mediated degradation varies among individual mRNA targets8–10. Immune
recognition is, therefore, a consequence of upregulation of NMD-controlled products above
a certain threshold that was set by the natural immune tolerance mechanisms. The NMD
inhibition strategy described in this study is simple, consisting of a single reagent that can be
synthesized by a cell-free chemical process, it obviates the need to identify TRAs or
adjuvants, and is broadly applicable as it targets a common pathway in all tumours. The
potency of the NMD inhibition approach was suggested when compared to GVAX
vaccination. Arguably, these first generation aptamer–siRNA conjugates and the dose and
treatment schedule can be further optimized. It would be of interest to determine in future
studies whether the NMD-induced antigens are cross-reactive among different tumours, and
if so to identify the dominant antigens induced by NMD inhibition.

METHODS SUMMARY
Tumour immunotherapy studies
Three-hundred-thousand parental or pTIG-U6tetOshRNA transduced CT26 tumour cells
were implanted subcutaneously in Balb/c or Nude mice. At the day of tumour implantation,
mice started receiving water supplemented with 10% sucrose with or without 2 mg ml−1
doxycycline (Sigma).
To evaluate the anti-tumour effects of PSMA aptamer–siRNAs, mice were implanted with 1
× 106 PSMA-CT26 tumour cells and injected with 400 pmoles of aptamer–siRNA in 100 μl
PBS via the tail vein at days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13. In combination therapy, treatment with
PSMA aptamer–siRNA was administered at days 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, and a single dose of 500
pmoles of 4-1BB aptamer dimer was administered on day 6.

To monitor metastasis, C57BL/6 mice were implanted with 105 B16-PSMA transduced cells
by the tail vein and injected with 400 pmoles of aptamer-siRNA conjugates at days 5, 8, 11,
14 and 17. When about half of the mice in the control groups had shown signs of morbidity
(approximately days 25–28), the mice were euthanized and their lungs were weighed. GMCSF-expressing B16/F10 tumour cells, provided by G. Dranoff, were irradiated (50 Gy) and
5 × 105 cells were injected subcutaneously at days 1, 4 and 7, or days 5, 8 and 11, as
described previously29.
For statistical analysis, P values were calculated using a Student’s t-test.
