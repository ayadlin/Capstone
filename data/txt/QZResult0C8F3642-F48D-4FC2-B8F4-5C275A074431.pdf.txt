ABSTRACT
Purpose: Antiangiogenic therapy is commonly being used for the treatment of
glioblastoma. However, the benefits of angiogenesis inhibitors are typically transient
and resistance often develops. Determining the mechanism of treatment failure of the
VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab for malignant glioma would provide insight
into approaches to overcome therapeutic resistance.
Experimental Design: In this study, we evaluated the effects of bevacizumab on
the autophagy of glioma cells and determined target genes involving in the regulation
of bevacizumab-induced autophagy.
Results: We demonstrated that bevacizumab treatment increased expression
of autophagy markers and autophagosome formation in cell culture experiments
as well as in in vivo studies. Gene expression profile analysis performed on murine
xenograft models of glioblastoma showed increased transcriptional levels of STAT1/
IRF1 signaling in bevacizumab resistant tumors compared to control tumors. In vitro
experiments showed that bevacizumab treatment increased IRF1 expression in a
dose and time dependent manner, which was coincident with bevacizumab-mediated
autophagy. Down regulation of IRF1 by shRNA blocked autophagy and increased
AIF-dependent apoptosis in bevacizumab-treated glioma cells. Consistently, IRF1
depletion increased the efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy in a glioma xenograft model,
which was due to less bevacizumab-promoted autophagy and increased apoptosis in
tumors with down-regulated IRF1.
Conclusions: These data suggest that IRF1 may regulate bevacizumab-induced
autophagy, and may be one important mediator of glioblastoma resistant to
bevacizumab.

INTRODUCTION

3]. The mechanisms by which tumors develop resistance
desperately need to be identified.
Recent reports suggest that autophagy might play
an important role in tumor resistance to anti-VEGF
therapy [4-6]. Autophagy is the process by which a cell
degrades its own cytoplasmic components and organelles
for cell survival. This process involves formation of the
autophagosomes. Autophagosomes fuse to the lysosome
to produce the autolysosome and enzymatic degradation
of autophagosome content to re-usable molecules, which
are released back into the cell [7]. This catabolic process
is activated in response to specific nutrient deficiencies,

Patients with glioblastoma invariably have a short
overall survival despite multimodality therapy. This is
mainly due to the acquired resistance to standard therapies
which leads to tumor recurrence and disease progression
[1]. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that
recognizes and blocks vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), has been approved for treatment of recurrent
glioblastoma [2]. However, the clinical benefits of antiVEGF therapy in most patients are transient and followed
by a restoration of angiogenesis and tumor progression [2,

general starvation and other cellular stresses [8]. By
inhibiting the tumor vasculature, bevacizumab, and other
antiangiogenic agents may cause nutrient deprivation
and oxygen stress in the tumor microenvironment, both
of which are known to induce the process of autophagy.
Hu et al. reported that bevacizumab increased regions of
hypoxia and higher levels of autophagy-mediating BNIP3
in glioblastoma tumor specimens. In vivo targeting of the
essential autophagy gene ATG7 in glioblastoma xenograftbearing mice disrupted tumor growth when combined
with bevacizumab treatment [4]. The combined treatment
of autophagy inhibitors and bevacizumab increased the
efficacy of antiangiogenesis therapy on glioblastoma
[4], colon [5] and hepatocellular carcinoma tumors [6].
However, the molecular mechanism by which autophagy
confers tumor resistance to bevacizumab is not well
understood. The recent study by Li et al. showed that
overexpression of interferon-regulatory factor-1 (IRF1)
induced autophagy in human hepatocellular carcinoma
cells. Silencing IRF1 by small hairpin RNA blocked
autophagy induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) [9]. It
is unknown if IRF1-regulating autophagy plays a role in
glioblastoma resistance to bevacizumab therapy.
In this study, we observed increased IRF1
expression in bevacizumab-resistant tumors, and this
expression was parallel with an increase in the molecular
hallmarks of autophagy. To determine whether IRF1
plays a role in the regulation of glioblastoma resistance
to bevacizumab, glioma cell lines U87 and glioma stem
cell-like cells (GSCs) were treated with bevacizumab at
different concentrations and the expression of IRF1 was
evaluated. We then generated stable glioma cell lines
with specific down-regulation of IRF1. These cell lines
were implanted into xenograft-bearing mice to determine
whether IRF1 impacts the efficacy of bevacizumab
therapy in glioblastoma. Our findings demonstrate that
bevacizumab-mediated autophagy was decreased in
IRF1 down-regulation tumors, which was coincident
with increased apoptosis, and an improvement in efficacy
of anti-VEGF therapy in glioma xenografts. These data
improve the understanding of the mechanisms by which
glioblastoma become resistant to bevacizumab and help
inform future clinical trials using novel drug combinations.

resistance occurs are not well understood. Recently,
increasing evidence showed that autophagy might
play a role in the tumor resistant to antiangiogenic
therapy. In a glioma xenograft mouse model, we found
an increased number of cells undergoing autophagy in
bevacizumab-treated mice tumors. Tumors treated for
6 weeks displayed a higher number of cells containing
autophagosomes (20.77±6.92% vs 1.1±1.14% untreated
tumors, P < 0.01) but also showed larger autophagosomes
(3600±3.39nm, 6 weeks vs 1335.29±1.61nm, 4 weeks
vs 35.29±0.36nm untreated tumor, P < 0.01) (Figure
1A). Immunohistochemical staining showed increased
expression of autophagy marker LC3B in bevacizumabtreated tumors (Figure 1B upper panel). Interestingly, we
found bevacizumab increased IRF1 expression in glioma
tumors (Figure 1B lower panel). Gene chip analysis of
control and bevacizumab resistant glioma tumors also
showed up-regulation of STAT1-IRF1 pathway (2.6
fold and 2.91 fold up-regulation for STAT1 and IRF1,
respectively, Figure 1C). This result was further confirmed
by real-time PCR (Figure 1D).

Bevacizumab promotes autophagy in vitro
Angiogenesis inhibition in vivo leads to tumor
tissue hypoxia and nutrient stress, both of which
activate autophagy. To determine whether bevacizumab
promotes autophagy independent on oxygen depletion
and subsequent hypoxia, two glioma cell lines (U87
glioblastoma cells and GSC11 glioma stem-like cells)
were incubated in medium containing either vehicle
(control) or bevacizumab. Western blot data demonstrated
that bevacizumab induced IRF1 expression, LC3-I to
LC3-II conversion and Bnip3 expression in a dose and
time-dependent manner (Figure 2A), the latter two
are hallmark of autophagy. Similarly, bevacizumab
(2.5 mg/ml) significantly increased LC3 punctate
staining in U87 cells (Figure 2B and quantified data
in Supplemental Figure 1A). Bevacizumab-treated
cells showed more autophagosomes; representative
electron microphotographs of control and bevacizumabtreated glioma cells are shown in Figure 2C. These
finding indicate that bevacizumab promotes autophagy
independent of hypoxia.

42.0±11.1, P = 0.18, Figure 5C). Since IRF1 regulated
autophagy in glioma cells in vitro, we then evaluated
autophagy level in glioma xenograft tumor tissues. We
found bevacizumab increased the autophagy marker LC3
staining in control shRNA tumors, which was not observed
in IRF1 shRNA tumors (Figure 6A). Western blot analysis
also showed increased LC3 expression and LC3-I to LC3II conversion in bevacizumab-treated control tumors, but
not in IRF1 shRNA tumors (Figure 6B). Transmission
electron microscope images of 6-week treated tumor
tissues showed that autophagosomes (Figure 6C, upper
panel, red arrows) were easily found in bevacizumabtreated control tumors. In IRF1 down-regulated tumors,
instead of this hallmark of autophagy, tumors displayed
condensed chromatin at the margins of the nucleus (Figure
6C, lower panel, green arrows) and increased cells with
loss of cellular integrity (Figure 6C, lower panel, yellow
arrows), which are classic signs of an apoptotic process.
Consistently, TUNEL assay showed that more apoptotic
signals were observed in IRF1 down-regulation tumors,
compared to control tumors treated with bevacizumab
(Figure 6D, P < 0.01). Taken together, these data indicate
that IRF1-regulated autophagy might be one mechanism
by which glioma tumors escape from the antiangiogenic
therapy. Inhibiting this autophagic progress might promote
apoptosis in glioma tumor cells and increase the efficacy
of antiangiogenic therapy in gliomas.

expression in a dose dependent way, which was inhibited
by IRF1 specific shRNA (Figure 3A). IRF1 depletion
inhibited bevacizumab-induced LC3 conversion and Bnip3
expression (Figure 3A). Similarly, IRF1 depletion reduced
LC3 punctate staining (Figure 3B and quantified data in
Supplemental Figure 1B) and autophagosomes numbers
(Figure 3C) in bevacizumab treated cells. These results
were further confirmed using an acridine orange assay,
which detects the formation of acidic cellular vesicles, a
hallmark of autophagy [17, 18].GSC11 cells showed an
increased percentage of cells stained with acridine orange
when treated for 48h with bevacizumab, and this increase
was further inhibited by IRF1 depletion (Figure 3D).

We next analyzed the levels of apoptosis in
bevacizumab treated cells. We conducted flow cytometry
using PE-Annexin V and 7-AAD to label apoptotic U87
and GSC11 cells (Annexin V+ 7-AAD- for early apoptosis
and Annexin V+ 7-AAD+ for late apoptosis). After
treatment with bevacizumab for 48 h, the percentage of
Annexin V+ cells in U87 cells with control shRNA was
12.6±0.7% versus 17.7±0.9% (P < 0.01) in U87 with
IRF1 shRNA. Similarly, IRF1 down-regulation also
increased levels of apoptosis in GSC11 cells treated
with bevacizumab (29.47±3.2% in controls compared
to 37.77±4.5% in IRF1 knockdown cells, P < 0.05). We
further found bevacizumab increased expressions of
Apoptosis-Inducing Factor (AIF) in nuclear fractions of
IRF1 down-regulated U87 and GSC11 cells (Figure 4C),
whereas caspase proteins did not change significantly
(Supplemental Figure 2). These data suggested that
bevacizumab induced AIF-dependent (and caspaseindependent) apoptosis in IRF1 down-regulated glioma
cells.

DISCUSSION
The proposed efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy
stems from its ability to devascularize a tumor and
thereby limit tumor growth. However, the efficacy of
antiangiogenic therapy is limited as malignant gliomas
appear to have high levels of intrinsic and acquired
resistance leading to short-lasting benefits of this
therapeutic approach [13, 19]. The understanding of
resistance mechanisms remains a major limitation towards
improving outcomes for patients. Although experimental
evidence demonstrates that infiltration and recruitment
of proangiogenic cells contributes to adaptive resistant
to antiangiogenic therapy [20, 21], more and more data
demonstrate that “tumor escape” from antiangiogenic
therapy is a complicated process that involves multiple
mechanisms [22]. The major aim of this study was
to determine the possible mechanisms underlying
glioblastoma resistance to bevacizumab, which is the
most commonly used angiogenesis inhibitor. We compared
gene expression profiles between control and bevacizumab
resistant glioblastoma tissues. Our data showed
bevacizumab treatment increased the expression of several
genes including the transcription factor-IRF1. We further
found IRF1-regulated autophagy promoted glioblastoma
resistance to bevacizumab treatment. Inhibition of this
IRF-1-mediated autophagy led to increased apoptosis and
enhanced efficacy of anti-VEGF therapy.

IRF1 depletion increases the efficacy of antiVEGF therapy in gliomas
To determine whether IRF1 plays a role in
glioblastoma resistance to antiangiogenic therapy, IRF1
down-regulated GSC11 cells were implanted into nude
mice. The mice were euthanized at different time points
and their brains removed and processed for analysis.
Western blot analysis showed that the expression of
IRF1 increased during bevacizumab treatment that was
not visible in IRF1 down-regulated mice tissues (Figure
5A). Figure 5B showed the representative images of 5
week treated mice brain H&E staining. Bevacizumab
significantly decreased tumor volume in IRF1 downregulated tumors (Figure 5C, 46.6±6.9 vs 9.0±2.6, P
< 0.01), whereas tumor volume was not decreased by
bevacizumab in control shRNA tumors (71.5±16.8 vs

IRF1 was the first of 9 identified mammalian
members of the IRF family [23, 24]. When induced by
various stimuli, such as viral infection and interferon,
IRF1 acts as a transcriptional activator of specific IFNstimulated genes that mediate diverse functions including
cellular responses to inflammation, programmed cell
death and tumor suppression [23, 25-28]. Recent studies
reported IRF1 also participates in regulating autophagy
with growth inhibition and cell death. Silencing IRF1
expression blocked autophagy induced by IFNγ [9].
However, another recent study demonstrated increased
autophagy and decreased apoptosis in IRF1 knockout
mice in a murine endotoxemia model [29]. In our study,
we found IRF1 down-regulation decreased autophagy and
increased apoptosis in bevacizumab-treated glioblastoma.
These disparate results may be attributed to the different
models that lead to different posttranslational modification
of IRF1, such as SUMOylation and phosphorylation [3033]. Park et al. reported that inoculation of SUMOylated
IRF1-transfected cells into athymic nude mice resulted in
tumor formation, suggesting SUMOylation converted the
tumor suppressor IRF1 into an oncogenic protein [33].
This function-converted modification was also observed
in the regulation of STAT1, which is an upstream regulator
of IRF1. A recent study by Zimmerman at al. showed
that phosphorylation status of pSTAT1 determines its
function as a tumor suppressor, with unphosphorylated
STAT1 acting as a tumor promoter that acts by elevating
resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis to promote immune
escape [34]. These data demonstrate that the STAT1-IRF1
pathway can be regulated by complicated posttranslational
modifications that confer proteins to exert opposite roles.
Our in vitro experiments on glioma cells showed that
bevacizumab not only increased the expression level
of IRF1, but also increased the size of IRF1 (Figure
2A and 3A), suggesting a possible posttranslational
modification by bevacizumab treatment. It is possible
that posttranslational modification of IRF1 is involved in
bevacizumab-induced autophagy, which partly contributes
to glioblastoma resistance to this therapy. Further studies
are needed to identify the molecular modulation leading
to posttranslational changes in IRF1 following drug
treatment.
Recent evidence suggests that although autophagy
may initially prevent tumor formation and growth,
tumor cells respond to treatment-related stressors by
using autophagy as a cyto-protective mechanism leading
to treatment resistance [4-6]. The devascularization
caused by bevacizumab increases tumor hypoxia
and nutrient deprivation in xenograft animal models.
In vitro experiments have shown that both hypoxia
[5, 35] and nutrient starvation [6] induce autophagy.
Interestingly, our data showed that bevacizumab can
directly induce autophagy in vitro, independent of tumor
microenvironment effects. Therefore, besides oxygen
stress and nutrient deprivation, direct sequestration

of VEGF with bevacizumab may directly promote
autophagy, which leads to drug resistance during antiVEGF therapy. The direct role of VEGF in autocrine
and paracrine signaling in glioma and its impact on cell

survival mechanisms deserves additional study.
Our in vitro data demonstrate IRF1 as a dual
regulator of autophagy and apoptosis in gliomal cell
lines with bevacizumab treatment. This phenomenon is
also observed in xenograft animal models and it has been
shown to contribute to adaptive resistance to bevacizumab
therapy. However, we cannot exclude that IRF1 might play
additional roles in the regulation of glioblatoma resistance
to bevacizumab considering the heterogeneity of the
tumor microenvironment in vivo. For example, STAT1IRF1 pathway might affect tumor progression and patients
outcome by regulating infiltrations of immune cells [37].
More investigations of IRF1 function in vivo should be
explored in the future.
Currently, chloroquine (CQ) and its derivatives are
the only inhibitors of autophagy that are available for
use in the clinic. Some studies have shown that although
CQ might be beneficial when used in combination with
cancer therapy drugs, its sensitizing effects can occur
independently of autophagy inhibition [38, 39]. More
specific autophagy inhibitors are clearly needed. Here we
provided evidence that IRF1 may play a role involved in
autophagy regulation and the interplay between autophagy
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and apoptosis in the setting of VEGF inhibition. Combined
treatment of an IRF1 inhibitor and bevacizumab may
increase the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy on
glioblastoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and transfection
Glioma stem cell-like cell line GSC11 was derived
from a glioblastoma patient that did not receive treatment
with bevacizumab and has been previously described
[10]. Human glioblastoma cell line U87 was obtained
from American Type Culture Collection. U87 cells were
maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine
serum, and GSC11 cells were maintained in suspension
in DMEM containing epidermal growth factor, basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and B27 (Invitrogen)
at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. For transfection, cells
were plated at a density of 3×105/6 well plate 3 h prior
to transfection. Transfection was carried out using
31488

Oncotarget

HyFect reagents according to the vendor’s instructions.
Transfected cultures were selected with puromycin
(5 μg/ml) for 10-14 days. At that time, antibioticresistant colonies were picked, pooled and expanded for
further analysis under selective conditions. The pGIPZ
control was generated with control oligonucleotide
GCTTCTAACACCGGAGGTCTT. pGIPZ IRF1 shRNA
was generated with TAGTGTACACCTCTGATCA.
For cell treatment, human lgG was used as a control
for all experiments, and bevacizumab was added at the
concentrations indicated [11].

The membranes were then incubated with horseradish
peroxidase-linked secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse
antibodies (Bio-Rad).

Immunofluorescence staining
Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as
previously described with minor modifications [12].
Briefly, formaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized with
Triton X-100 0.1% in PBS, and blocked with 5% serum
diluted in PBS-gel (0.2% gelatin in PBS) for 30 min. The
primary antibodies were incubated in blocking solution
overnight at 4°C. Immuno-staining was performed
using the primary antibody against LC3B (1:50, CST).
Coverslips were mounted using ProLong antifade reagent
(Invitrogen). The images were acquired with an inverted
deconvolution microscope. Images were taken with a
Zeiss Axioskop 40 microscope equipped with AxioVision
Rel.4.2 software.

Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin sections from xenografts were used
for immunohistochemical analysis. The slides were
deparaffinized and subjected to graded rehydration.
After blocking in 5% serum and an antigen retrieval step
(citrate buffer, pH 6.0), slides were incubated with primary
antibodies to CD31 (1:50, Abcam), LC3B (1:50, CST),
IRF1 (1:50, Santa Cruz) overnight at 4°C. After washing
in PBS with Tween 20, primary antibody reactions
were detected using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector
Laboratories) with the respective secondary antibody.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Samples were fixed with a solution containing
3% glutaraldehyde plus 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, for 1 hour. After fixation, the
samples were washed and treated with 0.1% Milliporefiltered cacodylate buffered tannic acid, postfixed with
1% buffered osmium tetroxide for 30 min, and stained
en bloc with 1% Millipore-filtered uranyl acetate. The
samples were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of
ethanol, infiltrated, and embedded in LX-112 medium.
The samples were polymerized in a 60°C oven for 2 days.
Ultrathin sections were cut in a Leica Ultracut microtome
(Leica, Deerfield, IL), stained with uranyl acetate and
lead citrate in a Leica EM Stainer, and examined in a JEM
1010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, USA,
Inc., Peabody, MA) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. 
Digital images were obtained using AMT Imaging System
(Advanced Microscopy Techniques Corp, Danvers, MA).

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from tumor bearing
mouse brain tissue using RNeasy Mini Kit coupled with
DNase treatment (QIAGEN) and reverse transcribed
with High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(Applied Biosystems). Each cDNA was analyzed in
triplicate using real-time TaqMan probes (Applied
Biosystems). Quantitative PCR analysis was performed
using a chromo 4 sequence-detection system (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). Relative quantification of mRNA
levels was performed using the comparative CT method
with GADPH as the reference gene and the formula 2 -∆∆ct.

Immunoblot analysis

Acridine orange staining

Cells were lysed in an ice-cold lysis buffer
containing 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA, 1% TritonX-100, 1 mM PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin,
and 1 μg/ml pepstain A. The protein concentration in the
supernatant was determined using a BCA protein assay
(Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Samples were subjected to
8-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the
separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were incubated with
the primary antibody against IRF1 (1: 1000, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), LC3B (1:1000, CST), Bnip3 (1:1000,
CST), Tubulin (1:3000, Sigma), AIF (1: 1000, CST),
coxIV (1: 1000, Calbiocam), Laminin B (1: 1000, Abcam).

For in vivo experiments, GSC cells (3 × 10 ) were
implanted intracranially into nude mice (7-9 mice per
group). Beginning 4 days after implantation, bevacizumab
(10mg/kg) or vehicle was administered by i.p. injection
twice a week [12]. The mice were euthanized at 4 and
6 week, and their brains were removed and processed
for analysis. All experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.
Animal survival analysis was performed using the KaplanMeier method and tumor volume comparisons between
groups were compared using the log-rank test. P < 0.05
was determined to be significant.
