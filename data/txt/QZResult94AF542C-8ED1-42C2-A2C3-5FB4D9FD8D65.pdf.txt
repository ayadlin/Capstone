Abstract

Author Manuscript

Tumor oncogenes include transcription factors that co-opt the general transcriptional machinery to
sustain the oncogenic state1, but direct pharmacological inhibition of transcription factors has thus
far proven difficult2. However, the transcriptional machinery contains various enzymatic cofactors that can be targeted for development of new therapeutic candidates3, including cyclindependent kinases (CDKs)4. Here we present the discovery and characterization of the first
covalent CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1, which has the unprecedented ability to target a remote cysteine
residue located outside of the canonical kinase domain, providing an unanticipated means of
achieving selectivity for CDK7. Cancer cell line profiling indicates that a subset of cancer cell
lines, including T-ALL, exhibit exceptional sensitivity to THZ1. Genome-wide analysis in Jurkat
T-ALL shows that THZ1 disproportionally affects transcription of RUNX1 and suggests that
sensitivity to THZ1 may be due to vulnerability conferred by the RUNX1 super-enhancer and this
transcription factor’s key role in the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry of these tumor cells.
Pharmacological modulation of CDK7 kinase activity may thus provide an approach to identify
and treat tumor types exhibiting extreme dependencies on transcription for maintenance of the
oncogenic state.

In an effort to discover new inhibitors of kinases that regulate gene transcription, we
performed cell-based screening and kinase selectivity profiling of a library of known and
novel ATP-site directed kinase inhibitors (See Supplementary Table 1 for known CDK7
inhibitors). We identified THZ1 (Fig. 1a), a phenylaminopyrimidine bearing a potentially
cysteine-reactive acrylamide moiety, as a low nanomolar inhibitor of cell proliferation and
biochemical CDK7 activity (Fig. 1b, c). To investigate the functional relevance of the
acrylamide moiety we prepared a non-cysteine reactive analog THZ1-R, which displayed
diminished activity for CDK7andreduced anti proliferative potency (Fig. 1b, c). KiNativ™
profiling5, which measures the ability of a compound to block nucleotide-dependent
enzymes from biotinylation with a reactive desthiobiotin-ATP probe, established CDK7 as
the primary intracellular target of THZ1, but not of THZ1-R (Supplementary Table 2).
Kinome-wide profiling identified additional kinase targets of THZ1; however, we confirmed
CDK7 as the only target displaying time-dependent inhibition, which is suggestive of
covalent binding (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c and Supplementary Table 3).

As no covalent inhibitors of CDKs have been reported, we next focused our studies on the
mechanism by which THZ1 could achieve covalent inhibition of CDK7. We first incubated
recombinant CDK7/cyclin H/MAT1 trimeric complex with a biotinylated version of THZ1
(bio-THZ1, Fig. 1a) and demonstrated that it indeed covalently modifies CDK7 (Fig. 2a;
Extended Data Fig. 1d–g). Mass spectrometry identified the site of covalent modification as
C312, a residue located outside the kinase domain (Extended Data Fig. 2a–d). Inspection of
the crystal structure reveals that a C-terminal extension of CDK7 bearing C312 traverses the
ATP cleft in the kinase domain and would be predicted to position Cys312 directly adjacent
to the reactive acrylamide moiety of THZ1 (Fig. 2b). Mutation to serine (C312S), a less
nucleophilic amino acid, prevented THZ1 from covalently binding to CDK7 and from
inhibiting CDK7 activity in an irreversible fashion (Fig. 2c; Extended Data Fig. 2e).
Sequence alignment of the 20-member CDK family suggests that Cys312 is unique to
CDK7, however CDK12 and CDK13 also possess accessible cysteines within 4 amino acids
of Cys312 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). Indeed, we found that THZ1 can inhibit CDK12 kinase
activity at slightly higher concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 3b–f). THZ1 is the first
inhibitor demonstrated to target a cysteine located outside of the kinase domain, which
provides an unanticipated means of achieving covalent selectivity.

CDK7 kinase activity has been implicated in the regulation of both transcription, where it
phosphorylates the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAP polymerase II (RNAPII)6–8 and
CDK99, and the cell cycle, where it functions as the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) for
CDKs1/2/4/610–14. THZ1, but not THZ1-R, completely inhibits the phosphorylation of the
established intracellular CDK7 substrate RNAPII CTD at Ser-5 and Ser-76,8, with
concurrent loss of Ser-2 phosphorylation at 250 nM in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2d). Cellular
washout experiments demonstrate that THZ1 indeed acts in an irreversible fashion (Fig. 2e,
f; Extended Data Fig. 4a–e). We observed a loss of CAK activity, as evidenced by decreased
phosphorylation of the activation loops of CDK1,2 and 9, indicating disruption of both
recognized CDK7 signaling pathways in Jurkat cells (Fig. 2d; Extended Data Fig. 4f, g) and
Loucy cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 4). Ectopic expression of dox-inducible FLAG-CDK7
C312S, but not FLAG-CDK7 WT, in Hela S3 cells restored RNAPII CTD p-Ser 5/7 to near
WT levels at concentrations of THZ1 up to 2.5 µM, establishing C312 as a critical
determinant of the cellular pharmacology of the inhibitor (Extended Data Fig. 5a–b).
Additionally, FLAG-CDK7 C312S expression restored CDK1/2 T-loop phosphorylation,
reduced early induction of cleaved PARP and restored the expression of a subset of genes,
including the highly –expressed transcription factors MYC, KLF4, ID1, and GATA2
(Extended Data Fig. 5c–e). The partial rescues of the hyperphosphorylated form of RNAPII
(RNAPII0) and RNAPII p-Ser2 CTD phosphorylation combined with the incomplete
restoration of gene expression may result, in part, from lower affinity cross-reactivity of
THZ1 with CDK12/13, which are bona fide Ser2 kinases15.
Our evidence that CDK7 inhibition leads to reduction in RNAPII CTD phosphorylation
status appears in conflict with evidence that inhibition of CDK7 alone is insufficient to
reduce RNAPII CTD phosphorylation in HCT116 cells9. It is possible that covalent
inhibition and reversible inhibition can engender different effects on kinase structure; we did
not find evidence that THZ1 impacts TFIIH or CAK complex stability (Extended Data Fig.
4h). It is also possible that inhibition of CDK12/13 (or another undetected kinase)

contributes to reduced RNAPII CTD phosphorylation, although our evidence that RNAPII
CTD phosphorylation levels are restored following expression of CDK7 C312S suggests
otherwise.

To better understand the breadth of antiproliferative activity of THZ1, we screened it against
a diverse panel of over 1,000 cancer cell lines16. THZ1 displayed broad-based activity with
IC50s less than 200 nM against 53% of the cell lines tested (Fig. 3a; Supplementary Table
4). Elastic net regression analysis incorporating gene expression, copy number, and
sequence variation genomics data16 across 527 of the cell lines tested were used to identify
genomic features common to sensitive cell lines. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment
analysis17 indicated a strong enrichment of (proto-) oncogenic transcription factors
commonly overexpressed in cancer and factors involved in RNAPII-driven transcriptional
regulation, suggesting the dominant activity of THZ1 was through modulation of
transcription (Fig. 3b; Supplementary Table 5).

Author Manuscript

In agreement with the net elastic regression analysis, T-ALL cell lines that display
characteristic misregulation of T-cell lineage-specific transcription factors, were broadly
sensitive to THZ1, but not THZ1-R (Fig. 3c; Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary
Table 4). Treatment of T-ALL cell lines with THZ1 caused decreased cellular proliferation
and an increase in apoptotic index with concomitant reduction in anti-apoptotic proteins,
most notably MCL-1 and XIAP (Extended Data Fig. 6, 7). These strong anti proliferative
responses induced at sub-effective doses of THZ1 suggest that these cells may be
particularly sensitive to small perturbations in transcription and CDK7 kinase function.
Indeed, THZ1 demonstrated efficacy against primary leukemia cells and in a bioluminescent
xenografted model using the human T-ALL cell line, KOPTK1, when dosed twice daily
(BID) at 10 mg/kg (Fig. 3d, e; Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 6).
Importantly, THZ1 was well tolerated at these doses with no observable body weight loss or
behavioral changes (Extended Data Fig. 8f), suggesting no overt toxicity to the animals.
These results were mirrored in cell culture with non-transformed BJ fibroblast and retinal
pigment epithelial (RPE-1) cells responding to relatively high doses of THZ1 by undergoing
cell cycle arrest rather than initiating apoptosis or cell death, further suggesting that normal
cells might tolerate transcriptional disruption (Extended Data Fig. 9).

Author Manuscript

CDK7 is a component of the general transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) complex18–20, so we
next investigated how THZ1 treatment affects genome-wide gene expression. We chose
Jurkat T-ALL for these studies because it a well-studied T-ALL cell line model with a
defined core transcriptional regulatory circuitry, consisting of key transcription factors,
which is also found in human T-ALL primagrafts21. Treatment with 250 nM THZ1, but not
THZ1-R, led to progressive reduction in global steady-state mRNA levels over time, with
75% and 96% of mRNAs showing greater than 2-fold reduction by 6 and 12 hrs,
respectively (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 10a and Supplementary Table 7). Consistent with
global downregulation of mRNA transcripts, 250 nM THZ1 reduced RNAPII occupancy
genome-wide at both promoters and gene bodies (Fig. 4b). By comparison, Flavopiridol
reduced RNAPII density across only gene bodies (Fig. 4b). This is consistent with the model
that CDK7 regulates RNAPII initiation and pausing while CDK9 regulates pause release
leading to processive elongation8,9,18–20,22–24.

Although 250 nM THZ1 inhibits global transcription, we found that some cancer cell lines,
particularly T-ALL, are sensitive to considerably lower concentrations of THZ1. We
postulated that the expression of certain genes might be especially sensitive to low doses of
THZ1 and therefore have a key role in driving the cellular response. Indeed, we found that
transcripts for only a subset of genes were substantially affected by treatment with 50 nM
THZ1, with that for RUNX1 among the most profoundly affected (Fig. 4c). There are at
least two reasons that low dose THZ1 treatment might cause a preferential loss of RUNX1
expression. Tumor cell oncogenes can acquire super-enhancers, which drive high-level
expression yet can be especially sensitive to perturbation25–28. Super-enhancer analysis in
Jurkat cells revealed that RUNX1 contains an exceptionally large super-enhancer domain
containing a previously described hematopoietic cell –specific enhancer (Fig. 4d; Extended
Data Fig. 10b–d and Supplementary Table 8)29. In addition, RUNX1 forms a core regulatory
circuitry with two additional transcription factors that play prominent roles in leukemia
biology, TAL1 and GATA3 (Fig. 4e)21. These factors auto regulate their own gene
expression while simultaneously regulating many other genes that comprise the active gene
expression program of Jurkat cells. Treatment with 50 nM THZ 1l ed to significant
reduction in both the transcript and protein levels of RUNX1, TAL1, and GATA3 (Extended
Data Fig. 10e and f). Loss of the RUNX1 driven transcriptional program is likely key to the
response to low dose THZ1 treatment, as gene set enrichment analysis revealed that the
Jurkat transcripts downregulated by 50 nM THZ1 were enriched in transcripts similarly
downregulated following RUNX1 depletion using shRNA (Fig. 4f).

Author Manuscript

Here we have reported the discovery and characterization of the first covalent inhibitor of
CDK7, THZ1. THZ1 employs a unique mechanism, combining ATP-site and allosteric
covalent binding, as means of attaining potency and selectivity for CDK7. This mechanistic
insight should be useful for designing next generation inhibitors of CDKs, where high
sequence and shape homology in the ATP pocket has posed a formidable challenge to
achieving selectivity with conventional ATP-competitive inhibitors. THZ1 displayed
exquisite anti proliferative activity for T-ALL cell lines and other blood cancers, where
oncogenic transcription factors feature prominently in the disease state.
In Jurkat cells, low dose THZ1 had a profound effect on a small subset of genes, including
the key regulator RUNX1, thus contributing to subsequent loss of the greater gene
expression program and cell death. Identification of additional cancer cell lines whose gene
expression programs display vulnerability to THZ1 or other transcriptional inhibitors should
delineate additional cancers that are exquisitely susceptible to perturbation of transcription.

Inhibitor treatment experiments

Author Manuscript

Time-course experiments such as those described in Extended Data Fig. 5a were conducted
to determine the minimal time required for full inactivation of CDK7. Cells were treated
with THZ1, THZ1-R, or DMSO for 0–6 hrs to assess the effect of time on the THZ1 –
mediated inhibition of RNAPII CTD phosphorylation. For subsequent experiments cells
were treated with compounds for 4 hrs as determined by time-course experiment described
above, unless otherwise noted. For inhibitor washout experiments (Fig. 2e, f; Extended Data
Fig. 5) cells were treated with THZ1, THZ1-R, or DMSO for 4 hrs. Medium containing
inhibitors was subsequently removed to effectively ‘washout’ the compound and the cells
were allowed to grow in the absence of inhibitor. For each experiment, lysates were probed
for RNAPII CTD phosphorylation and other specified proteins.
High-throughput cell line panel viability assay

Author Manuscript

Cells were seeded in 384-well microplates at ~15% confluency in medium with 5% FBS and
penicillin/streptavidin. Cells were treated with THZ1 or DMSO for 72 hrs and cell viability
was determined using resazurin.
RNA Extraction and Synthetic RNA Spike-In
Total RNA and sample preparation was performed as previously described30. Briefly,
following inhibitor treatment cell number was determined, total RNA was isolated, and
ERCC RNA Spike-In Mix (Ambion, cat# 4456740) was added to total RNA relative to cell
number.
Expanded protocols and synthetic chemistry schemes can be found in Supplementary
