mesenchymal transition in colon cancer

Aberrant T-cell factor (TCF) transcription is implicated in the majority of colorectal cancers (CRCs). TCF transcription induces epithelial–
mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting a tumor-initiating cell (TIC) phenotype characterized by increased proliferation, multidrug
resistance (MDR), invasion and metastasis. The data presented herein characterize topoisomerase IIα (TopoIIα) as a required component
of TCF transcription promoting EMT. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and protein co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies,
we show that TopoIIα forms protein–protein interactions with β-catentin and TCF4 and interacts with Wnt response elements (WREs)
and promoters of direct target genes of TCF transcription, including: MYC, vimentin, AXIN2 and LEF1. Moreover, both TopoIIα and TCF4
ChIP with the N-cadherin promoter, which is a new discovery indicating that TCF transcription may directly regulate N-cadherin
expression. TopoIIα N-terminal ATP-competitive inhibitors, exempliﬁed by the marine alkaloid neoamphimedine (neo), block TCF
activity in vitro and in vivo. Neo effectively inhibits TopoIIα and TCF4 from binding WREs/promoter sites, whereas protein–protein
interactions remain intact. Neo inhibition of TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription also correlates with signiﬁcant antitumor effects
in vitro and in vivo, including the reversion of EMT, the loss of TIC-mediated clonogenic colony formation, and the loss of cell motility
and invasion. Interestingly, non-ATP-competitive inhibitors of TopoIIα, etoposide and merbarone, were ineffective at preventing
TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription. Thus, we propose that TopoIIα participation in TCF transcription may convey a mechanism of
MDR to conventional TopoIIα inhibitors. However, our results indicate that TopoIIα N-terminal ATP-binding sites remain conserved and
available for drug targeting. This article deﬁnes a new strategy for targeted inhibition of TCF transcription that may lead to effective
therapies for the treatment of CRC and potentially other Wnt-dependent cancers.

INTRODUCTION
The colon epithelium comprises tube-shaped glands known as the
crypts of Lieberkühn.1 The epithelial cells lining these crypts are
highly ordered and segmented: the base contains stem cells that
produce proliferating progenitor cells that are migratory and feed
into the upper part of the crypt where they become differentiated
and non-proliferating.1,2 The Wnt signaling pathway, which controls
T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor (TCF/LEF) gene
transcription, denoted throughout as TCF transcription, dominates
this self-renewing process.2–4 Under normal control adenomatous
polyposis coli acts as a gatekeeper3 of this pathway by regulating
the fate of cytoplasmic β-catenin through transport and binding
of the destruction complex, which includes: axis inhibition protein
(AXIN), casein kinase 1 (CK1), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and
glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3).5 In the absence of Wnt
signaling, β-catenin is marked for proteasomal degradation by
the destruction complex. However, Wnt signals inhibit destruction, leading to β-catenin nuclear localization and activation of
TCF transcription.6 Mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli or
β-catenin are early events that promote colorectal cancer (CRC)
through constitutive activation of TCF transcription.2,7 Such
mutations allow for a proliferating progenitor cell phenotype in
1

the upper crypt leading to polyp formation or dysplastic aberrant
crypt foci.2,3 Proto-oncogenic and tumor-suppressor mutations
in genes such as KRAS and p53 cause adenomas and then
carcinomas.3,7,8 Aberrant TCF transcription is implicated in the vast
majority of all CRCs, including familial adenomatous polyposis
as well as 80% of sporadic CRC.3
Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a reversible process
essential for embryonic development and wound healing.9,10 EMT
allows cells to transition between adherent (epithelial) or mobile
(mesenchymal) phenotypes. EMT is characterized by loss of
expression of epithelial biomarkers such as E-cadherin and Zonula
Occludens-1 (ZO-1) with concomitant re-expression of mesenchymal biomarkers such as vimentin and Slug.10,11 These changes in
expression and other signaling events lead to the loss of tight cell
adherent junctions and reorganization of the cytoskeleton,
promoting the motile and invasive phenotype that is also resistant
to apoptosis.12 Aberrant EMT is implicated in some of the most
prominent human diseases, including tumor progression and
metastasis.13,14 TCF activity and cues from the microenvironment
stimulate EMT to acquire an invasive phenotype that can promote
metastatic dissemination.15–18 TCF-mediated EMT also promotes
biologically distinct populations of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) with

'stem cell-like' properties, termed CRC stem cells (CRCSC).19–23 Hence,
targeting EMT as a therapeutic strategy may result in more effective
treatments and better outcomes for CRC patients. Although our
collective knowledge of the biology of EMT is immense, signiﬁcant
challenges remain in identifying viable targets for therapeutic
development.
The multicellular tumor spheroid model (MCTS) is well established
as an effective model for cancer drug discovery, which can be used
to incorporate important components affecting EMT such as the
tumor microenvironment (for example, extracellular matrix).24
Previously, we developed a MCTS model of triple-negative breast
cancer EMT suitable for high-throughput screening drug discovery.25
Similarly, we have developed a model that utilizes vimentin promoter
(VimPro) driven enhanced green ﬂuoresecent protein (GFP) stably
engineered as a surrogate reporter of the mesenchymal phenotype
in SW620 MCTS CRC. We chose vimentin because it is a wellcharacterized biomarker that has a functional role in the mesenchymal phenotype and has been shown to be predictive for lymph
node metastasis and poor prognosis in CRC.26–28 Using this model,
we identiﬁed neoamphimedine (neo) (Figure 1a), a marine alkaloid
from Xestospongia sp. that signiﬁcantly downregulates vimentin
expression. Neo was ﬁrst identiﬁed by Ireland and Barrows to be
an inhibitor of topoisomerase IIα (TopoIIα).29,30 TopoIIα is an
important drug target for the treatment of many types of cancer
because of its ability to modulate the topology of DNA, making it an
essential enzyme for cell cycle progression.31 Unlike conventional
TopoIIα drugs used in the clinic (for example, etoposide), neo does
not poison TopoIIα by stabilizing enzyme-DNA complexes.29 Instead,
we have shown that neo is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of the
N-terminal ATPase domain, eliciting anticancer effects.32,33 Furthermore, this mode of inhibition appears to overcome signiﬁcant
multidrug resistance (MDR) observed with TopoIIα poisons.32
Herein, we describe and characterize TopoIIα as a DNA-binding
partner for the TCF transcription complex that promotes EMT
and the malignant phenotype. We show that ATP-competitive
inhibitors can block TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription,
reversing EMT. These effects correlate with a signiﬁcant loss of
CRCSC stemness and invasive potential. Finally, we also show that
inhibiting TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription in vivo results in
diminished tumor growth. Taken together, our results indicate a
role for TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription as a master regulator
of EMT in CRC.
RESULTS
TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription regulates EMT in CRC
SW620 CRC cells stably transduced with VimPro-GFP and NuclightRed were cultured as MCTS arrayed in 96-well plates as single
uniform spheroids. This live multiplex assay allows us to monitor the
modulation of EMT and cytotoxic effects in real time without ﬁxing
or adding reagents to the system. SW620 MCTS treated with neo
exhibited signiﬁcant downregulation of VimPro-GFP expression in a
dose- and time-dependent manner over 72 h compared with 1%
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) vehicle and 10% TritonX-100, a control
used to indicate MCTS cell death (Figures 1b and c). As we have
previously characterized neo as an N-terminal ATP-competitive
inhibitor of TopoIIα,32 we also tested a clinically used TopoIIα drug,
etoposide, for its ability to downregulate vimentin expression.
Etoposide and other TopoIIα poisons act through binding to the
C-terminus of TopoIIα and stabilizing a transient covalent complex
with DNA, known as the cleavage complex.31 Even at a high
concentration of 50 μM, etoposide had no effect on VimPro-GFP
expression (Figures 1b and c). We also examined vimentin protein
expression by ﬁxing and staining SW620 MCTS after neo or
etoposide treatment (Figure 1d). Like VimPro-GFP expression, neo
signiﬁcantly downregulated vimentin protein expression, whereas
etoposide had no apparent effect. Loss of E-cadherin with

because of MCTS cell death. (d) Close up images of SW620

SW620 MCTS, whereas etoposide did not. Images were captured

concomitant upregulation of vimentin, SNAI2 (Slug), and zinc-ﬁnger
E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) expression correlates with
increased metastatic potential, tumor recurrence and overall poor
prognosis in CRC patients.34 In addition, decreased expression of
E-cadherin and ZO-1 in CRC correlates with liver metastasis.35 To
further assess neo’s effect on EMT, we conducted western blot
analysis using CRC MCTS after 72-h treatments with neo (Figure 2a).
The results indicate that neo downregulated mesenchymal markers,

including: vimentin, Slug, ZEB1 and the proto-oncogene product MYC
(c-Myc). Moreover, neo treatment also resulted in the upregulation of
epithelial markers ZO-1 and E-cadherin.
To further validate TopoIIα as the target of interest, we treated
SW620 MCTS with another N-terminal ATP-competitive inhibitor of
TopoIIα, benzothiazole amino purine (BAP-1), reported by Novartis
(Cambridge, MA, USA) (Supplementary Figure S1) (see Supplementary
Figure S1 and Daumar et al.36 for BAP-1 preparation).37 BAP-1 mimics
neo’s effects on EMT by downregulating vimentin, Slug, ZEB1 and
c-Myc. Our next goal was to determine if neo’s anticancer effects
resulted from inhibiting an alternative target other than TopoIIα.
Protein kinases have emerged as the predominant factors promoting
human cancers.38,39 Thus, we screened neo against a panel of 156
kinase enzymes implicated in carcinogenesis using the KinaseSeeker
assay.40 The kinase inhibition data indicate that neo is not a potent
kinase inhibitor (Supplementary Figure S2). Taken together, the data
in Figure 1, Supplementary Figure S1 support TopoIIα as a major
cellular target of neo.
Neo inhibition of TopoIIα resulted in the downregulation
of vimentin, Slug, ZEB1 and c-Myc, which are direct downstream
targets of TCF transcription.16,28 Therefore, we hypothesized that
TopoIIα affects EMT through a TCF-dependent mechanism. To test
this hypothesis, we conducted inhibition studies utilizing the
well-characterized TOPﬂash (TOP) reporter.41 We subcloned TOP
into a lentiviral backbone and stably transduced this vector into
DLD1, HCT116, SW480 and SW620 cells and used these cells to
generate MCTS. After 72-h treatment with neo, we observed
signiﬁcant downregulation of TCF activity in all the CRC MCTS
compared with the DMSO controls (Figure 2b). Using HCT116
MCTS, we determined neo’s dose response for inhibiting TopoIIαdependent TCF transcription (IC50 = 3.5 μM) (Figure 2c). Similarly,
neo also induced MCTS cytotoxicity (IC50 = 4.2 μM). To conﬁrm that
neo’s effect on TCF transcription was not a result of cell death, we
conducted a time course study for both cytotoxicity (ﬂuorescence)
and TCF activity (luminescence) (Figure 2d). This experiment
revealed that neo ﬁrst inhibited TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription over a time course of 20 h (Figure 2d inset) and then
cytotoxicity ensued with signiﬁcant cell death occurring at 56 h.
In addition to MCTS models of CRC, neo displays potent nM
cytotoxicity in a panel of 32 CRC cell lines cultured as monolayers
(Supplementary Figure S3). Like neo, it is important to emphasize
that most anticancer agents display more potent cytotoxicity
in two-dimensional cell culture models compared with threedimensional (3D) MCTS.42

Figure 2. ATP-competitive inhibition of TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription correlates with the reversion of EMT and cell death in MCTS.
(a) MCTS western blot indicates that neo reverted EMT, evidenced by
the downregulation of a panel of key mesenchymal genes (including
the proto-oncogene c-Myc) and upregulation of key epithelial genes
ZO-1 and E-cadherin. (b) Neo signiﬁcantly inhibited TCF transcription in
a panel of CRC MCTS stably transduced with the TOPﬂash reporter.
(c) HCT116 MCTS 72-h cytotoxicity dose response for neo was
measured using the Celltox Green assay (left, cytotoxicity IC50 = 4.2 μM),
and a dose response for neo inhibition of TCF transcription was
measured using HCT116 MCTS stably transduced with the TOPﬂash
reporter (right, TCF activity inhibition IC50 = 3.5 μM). (d) A time course
study for cytotoxicity and TCF transcription indicates that neo induced
signiﬁcant cytotoxicity at t = 56 h compared with DMSO. Neo
signiﬁcantly inhibited TCF activity at or before t = 20 h shown as an
inset indicated with a black arrow. Therefore, neo inhibition of TopoIIαdependent TCF transcription is an early event leading to MCTS cell
death. Bar graphs indicate average ± s.d. The t-test statistical analysis
was used to determine signiﬁcance, where *P ⩽ 0.05, **P ⩽ 0.01 and
***P ⩽ 0.001.

ATP-competitive inhibitors of TopoIIα block TopoIIα-dependent
TCF transcription
To further assess the mechanism of action resulting in the inhibition
of TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription, we conducted inhibition
studies using three different classes of TopoIIα inhibitors, including:
ATP-competitive inhibitors (neo and BAP-1), a general catalytic
inhibitor (merbarone) and a poison (etoposide). For this study, we
utilized a simpliﬁed two-dimensional cell-based model using relative

high concentrations of drug in order to measure inhibition over
a 6 h time course using DLD1, HCT116, SW480 and SW620 cells
transfected with TOP (Figure 3). Neo and BAP-1 blocked TCF activity
in a dose-dependent manner, and neo displayed more potent
inhibition of TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription (Figures 3a and b).
Etoposide had no inhibition of TCF activity over a concentration
range between 50 and 200 μM (Figure 3c), which is consistent with
the data shown in Figure 1. Similarly, merbarone was ineffective at
inhibiting TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription, and signiﬁcantly
upregulated TCF activity or caused complete cell death in SW620
cells (Figure 3d). To further characterize TopoIIα as a required
component of TCF transcription, we stably knocked down TopoIIα
using short hairpin RNA (shRNA; sh78 and sh79) in HCT116 and
SW480 cells followed by transfecting the TOP reporter. Compared
with scrambled control shRNA, sh78 and sh79 signiﬁcantly
downregulate TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription, recapitulating
neo’s inhibitory effects (Figure 3e). The level of TCF transcription
inhibition was correlated with the level of TopoIIα knockdown by
western blot quantiﬁcation. Taken together, the data in Figure 3
indicate that TopoIIα is an important component of TCF
transcription. Moreover, ATP-competitive inhibition of TopoIIα
proves to be an effective mode of action to block TopoIIαdependent TCF transcription.
TopoIIα functions as a DNA-binding partner for the TCF complex
We hypothesized that TopoIIα participates in the TCF complex
by forming protein–protein interactions via its C-terminus.
Consistent with our hypothesis, Huang et al.43 reported that
TopoIIα co-immunoprecipitated (co-IP) with TCF4 and β-catenin
using DLD1 cells, and they identiﬁed that protein–protein
interactions occur via the C-terminus of TopoIIα. To test our
hypothesis, we conducted co-IP studies using SW620 cells
(Figure 4a) as well as DLD1 and HCT116 cells (Supplementary
Figure S5) that were treated with or without neo. Our goal was
to identify protein–protein interactions and to determine if neo
could block these interactions. The data in Figure 4a and
Supplementary Figure S5 demonstrate that TopoIIα formed
robust interactions with β-catenin as well as with TCF4. However,
neo treatment did not prevent these protein–protein interactions from occurring.
TCF proteins bind to consensus sequences known as Wntresponsive elements (WREs).44 To determine if TopoIIα functions
as a DNA-binding partner for the TCF complex, we conducted
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies with TopoIIα and
TCF4.45 Indeed, TopoIIα and TCF4 bind to known TCF target gene
WRE/promoter sites, including: AXIN2, MYC, LEF1 and vimentin
(Figure 4b), and neo inhibits their binding to these sites. Moreover,
we conducted ChIP analysis using the N-cadherin promoter
and found that both TopoIIα and TCF4 bind to this promoter
and neo can also signiﬁcantly inhibit these protein–DNA interactions. N-cadherin expression has been shown to be upregulated
because of TCF transcription, promoting EMT.46–48 The direct
binding interactions we observed with both TopoIIα and TCF4 are
novel discoveries, indicating that TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription may directly regulate N-cadherin gene expression, which
is a key EMT effector.14

TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription promotes a malignant
phenotype in CRC
Wnt/TCF transcription has been reported to promote a CRCSC
phenotype, and both EMT and CRCSC phenotypes are associated
because of overlapping gene expression.14,19,23,49,50 Therefore, it is
likely that inhibiting TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription will also
suppress CRCSCs. To test this, we utilized the clonogenic assay,
which is a surrogate measure of the stemness of TICs or cancer
stem cells.49,51 We found that inhibition of TopoIIα either by
shRNA or by neo inhibited clonogenic colony formation

using SW620 cells treated with neo (10 μM) or DMSO for 6 h. Western blot from nuclear lysates used for IP is denoted as input (IN) before IP or
ﬂow through (FT) after IP. The results indicate that TopoIIα forms protein–protein interactions with β-catenin and TCF4 in nuclei, and that neo
treatment does not prevent these interactions. (b) Using SW620 cells and the same neo treatment conditions for co-IP, ChIP studies were
performed to determine protein–DNA interactions. TopoIIα and TCF4 bind to WREs/promoters as indicated and neo signiﬁcantly inhibits
this protein–DNA binding interaction. All experiments were conducted at least two times. QPCR from ChIP was conducted with duplicates.

shRNA displayed signiﬁcantly diminished CRCSC mediated colony formation compared with the scrambled control (Scr). (b) Pretreatment of
SW620 cells for 24 h with Neo, as indicated, signiﬁcantly reduced the number of colonies formed. (c) Continuous exposure of HCT116 cells for
three different periods of time (2, 24 and 120 h) with various concentrations of neo followed by clonogenic analysis demonstrated that
inhibition of colony formation by neo was both concentration and exposure time dependent. (d) Neo treatments in HCT116 cells inhibited
wound healing migration in a dose-dependent manner compared with DMSO, whereas etoposide increased migration (data presented as the
average of six replicates). (e) CRC MCTS treated with neo or etoposide, as indicated for 72 h, were dissociated and either plated into invasion
chambers or in 96-well plates to assess invasion and proliferation, respectively. The invasive potential normalized to proliferation indicated
that neo inhibited invasion independent of cell growth. Etoposide either had no effect or increased the invasion potential (n = 4). ImageJ
analysis was used to quantify CRC colony formation and the t-test analysis was used to assess statistical signiﬁcance, where *P ⩽ 0.05,
**P ⩽ 0.01. Bar and line graphs indicate average ± s.d.

(Figures 5a and b). Pretreating cells with 100 nM neo for 24 h
before plating the clonogenic assay was sufﬁcient to reduce
colony formation by approximately 50% over 10 days. We then
investigated the time–survival relationships with various durations
of pre-exposure to neo against HCT116 cells (Figure 5c). For a 2, 24
and 120-h exposures at least 2.6, 0.5 and 0.1 μM of neo were
required to obtain a 90% clonogenic killing, respectively.
Inherent to the EMT positive TIC phenotype is increased
motility. Thus, we assessed neo’s ability to prevent cell migration
Oncogene (2016) 4990 – 4999

and invasion compared with DMSO and etoposide (Figures 5d and e).
Neo signiﬁcantly inhibited cell migration in a dose-dependent
manner. By stark contrast, etoposide increased the migration
potential. Next, we conducted invasion assays using cells
harvested from SW48 and SW620 MCTS that were treated with
neo or etoposide. After treatment, MCTS were dissociated into
single-cell suspensions and seeded into either 96-well invasion
chambers coated with Matrigel or into standard 96-well tissue
culture plates to assess proliferation (Figure 5e). Importantly, no

further treatment was done after dissociating the MCTS or during
the invasion studies. The invasive potential normalized to cell
proliferation indicates that neo signiﬁcantly inhibits invasion. Like
migration, etoposide increases the invasive potential of SW620
cells and had no effect on SW48 cells.
TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription promotes tumor growth
in vivo
To further validate our in vitro ﬁndings, we conducted in vivo
tumor growth studies using SW620 cells stably transduced with
the TOPﬂash reporter, allowing us to monitor TopoIIα-dependent
TCF activity by IVIS imaging. First, we administered neo (25 mg/kg)
by intraperitoneal or intravenous tail vain injection similar to
the protocol used by Marshall et al.29 However, we observed no

antitumor activity. This result is most likely due to pharmacokinetic and distribution issues with neo. As shown in Supplementary
Figure S6, neo is metabolized substantially by liver microsomes
and pharmacokinetic data in rats show less metabolism of neo
than mice, which reach a Cmax following intravenous administration of 1.4 mg/kg, approximately 1 μM (315 ng/ml). This concentration is substantially below the 10 μM shown to signiﬁcantly
decrease TCF activity by TOP in cell culture after 6-h exposure
(Figure 3a), and even with a linear extrapolation between mice
dosed at 25 mg/kg and rats dosed at 1.4 mg/kg the plasma
concentration in mice would be estimated to reach a Cmax of
17.9 μM and remain above 10 μM for o 2 h. Next, we repeated the
tumor growth study administering neo by intratumoral injection.
Neo downregulated TCF transcription and tumor volume in a dosedependent manner over 22 days (Figures 6a and b). In addition,

Figure 6. Neo inhibits TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription and tumor growth in SW620 xenografts. (a) Neo was administered intratumoral
(i.t.) 1 × per week over 22 days. Within 15 days of neo treatment, measured by IVIS imaging, we observed a signiﬁcant loss of TOPﬂash TCF
transcriptional activity in the 0.5 mg/kg treatment group and complete loss of TCF activity in the 5 mg/kg treatment group, t-test where
*P ⩽ 0.05, **P ⩽ 0.01, ***P ⩽ 0.001. Scatter plots indicate average ± s.d. (b) SW620 xenografts were treated with neo via i.t. 1 × per week as
indicated for 22 days. Neo inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner compared with the vehicle control and the 5 mg/kg
treatment group signiﬁcantly inhibited tumor growth by day 15 and prevented tumor growth for the remainder of the study compared with
the vehicle group, *P ⩽ 0.05, **P ⩽ 0.01. (c) SW620 cells and (d) SW480 cells stably transduced with scrambled or TopoIIα shRNA (50% and 90%
knockdown for SW620 and SW480, respectively) were used to generate tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice. Paired t-test analysis
indicated that the TopoIIα knockdown group had signiﬁcantly diminished tumor volumes compared with the scrambled shRNA control group.
In addition, the magnitude of TopoIIα knockdown correlated with signiﬁcance of tumor inhibition. Line graphs indicate average ± s.e.m.

knockdown of TopoIIα expression by 50% (SW620) and 90% (SW480)
also signiﬁcantly reduced tumor volume (Figures 6c and d). These
animal studies further validate TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription
as a mechanism promoting tumor growth, which can be inhibited
with ATP-competitive inhibitors of TopoIIα.
DISCUSSION
Since the discovery of topoisomerases in 1971,52 these ubiquitous
enzymes have proved to be essential for regulating DNA topology,
including: supercoiling/relaxation, knotting/unknotting and catenation/
decatenation. In particular, TopoIIα has emerged as a master regulator
of the cell cycle for its role in decatenating chromatin DNA, which is a
checkpoint required for G2-M phase progression.53 Moreover, the
range of important biological functions and protein–protein interactions for TopoIIα is ever expanding.54 The data presented herein
deﬁne TopoIIα as a DNA-binding partner of the TCF transcription
complex. Using TopoIIα inhibitors and shRNA, we determined
that TopoIIα is a required component of TCF transcription.
Interestingly, only ATP-competitive inhibitors of TopoIIα, exempliﬁed by neo, prevent TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription. TCF/LEF members have modest DNA-binding afﬁnity and
speciﬁcity.55,56 To dynamically regulate gene expression TCF/
LEFs also recruit other DNA-binding factors to regulate their
afﬁnity to WREs/promoter sites.55,56 As TopoIIα is a key enzyme
regulating DNA topology, we hypothesized that it functions
as a DNA-binding protein for the TCF complex. Indeed, the ChIP
data in Figure 4b indicate that TopoIIα binds to WRE/promoter
sites and that DNA-binding by both TopoIIα and TCF4 can be
inhibited by neo.
As a result of our ﬁndings, we conclude that TopoIIα functions as a
DNA-binding partner for the TCF complex interacting with β-catenin,
TCF4 and DNA through the C-terminus of TopoIIα (Figure 7a).
Further, we hypothesize that ATP is required for TopoIIα-dependent

TCF transcription and that N-terminal ATP-binding sites are
conserved and available when TopoIIα participates in the TCF
complex, allowing for ATP-competitive inhibition by neo (Figure 7b).
The requirement of ATP is substantiated by the fact that neo
prevents TopoIIα and TCF4 from binding to WRE/promoter sites,
which in turn may decrease the entire TCF complex binding afﬁnity
preventing transcription. Bates et al.57 recently proposed that the
energy of ATP hydrolysis by TopoIIα is used to strengthen both
TopoIIα homodimer protein–protein interactions and TopoIIα–DNA
interactions by inducing favorable binding conformations, which
is in agreement with our ﬁndings and hypothesis. Although
a mechanism of action requiring ATP hydrolysis may be an Achilles
heel to drug resistance with ATP-competitive inhibitors, the
participation of TopoIIα in the TCF protein complex may conversely
be a mechanism of MDR for other TopoIIα inhibitors such as
etoposide and merbarone. MDR is a major problem associated with
the existing clinically used TopoIIα inhibitors,58 including substrates
of the MDR efﬂux pump58 or through alterations in TopoIIα
structure59 like those that are likely to arise from TopoIIα participation
in the TCF complex. Recently, we reported that neo can overcome
MDR because of alterations in TopoIIα where etoposide, doxorubicin
and ICRF-193 were ineffective.32
Drug discovery against the Wnt/TCF pathway has been
hampered by signiﬁcant challenges in identifying druggable
targets.59 This report validates TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription as a druggable target and demonstrates that inhibition of
TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription is an early event that
correlates with signiﬁcant antitumor effects and may ultimately
prevent invasion and metastasis. Speciﬁcally, we show that neo
induces the reversion of EMT by downregulating vimentin, Slug,
ZEB1 and c-Myc expression with concomitant upregulation
of E-cadherin and ZO-1. Importantly, both E-cadherin and ZO-1
are negatively regulated by Slug and ZEB1,14 which is in
agreement with our ﬁndings. Furthermore, TCF transcription
directly regulates vimentin, Slug and ZEB1,16,28 promoting EMT
during CRC tumor progression and metastasis.15–18 Thus, TopoIIαdependent TCF transcription may function as a master regulator
of EMT by regulating key EMT effectors. Reversion of EMT by
a single agent, neo, through the blockade of TCF transcription
correlates with the loss of malignant phenotype and signiﬁcantly
inhibited tumor growth in mice.
In conclusion, TopoIIα is highly expressed in CRC, particularly in
metastatic or recurring CRC.60,61 This article deﬁnes a role for
TopoIIα as a DNA-binding factor required for TCF transcription that
promotes EMT and the malignant phenotype in CRC. Moreover,
TopoIIα is a versatile drug target that may emerge not only as
a master regulator of the cell cycle but also to function as a master
regulator of gene expression by participating as an ATPdependent DNA-binding partner in an array of gene transcriptional machinery. Thus, ATP-competitive inhibitors of TopoIIα may
be effective targeted therapies for the treatment of CRC and
potentially many other types of cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture

Figure 7. Model for TopoIIα-dependent TCF transcription and inhibition with ATP-competitive inhibitors. (a) TopoIIα forms C-terminus
protein–protein interactions with β-catenin and TCF4, and functions
as a DNA-binding protein for the TCF complex, which is required for
WRE/promoter activation, inducing mesenchymal gene expression
and EMT. (b) ATP-competitive inhibitors of TopoIIα, such as neo, bind
to N-terminal ATP sites, preventing TopoIIα-TCF complex protein–DNA
interactions, which in turn leads to the downregulation of mesenchynal gene expression with concomitant upregulation of epithelial
genes, promoting mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET).

Cell lines were cultured as monolayers or MCTS using RPMI-1640 containing
5% fetal bovine serum. MCTS were generated using our previously reported
method25 by seeding 20 000 cells per well into un-coated 96-well U-bottom
Ultra Low Attachment Microplates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA). Four days
after plating, MCTS were treated with compounds in 25 μl of medium
containing 5% Matrigel for 72 h.

VimPro-GFP reporter, protein staining, and 3D western blots with
MCTS
SW620 cells were transduced with Nuclight-Red virus (Essen BioSciences, Ann
Arbor, MI, USA) and selected with Zeocin (200 μg/ml), and then transduced
with pCDH-VimPro-GFP-EF1-puro virus and selected with puromycin at 4 μg/ml.

Q Zhou et al

4997
The dual ﬂuorescently labeled cells were used to generate 3D MCTS and
treated as described. MCTS images were recorded every 2 h over a 72-h
period using an IncuCyte ZOOM content imaging system (Essen
BioSciences) (n = 3). SW620 cells transduced with Nuclight-Red were used
to generate 3D MCTS and treated as described. Protein staining and
western blot analyses were done as previously reported.25 MCTS were
imaged using an Operetta System (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). All
western blots were replicated twice.

MCTS cytotoxicity
The CellTox Green assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) was used with 3D
MCTS to measure spheroid death (n = 3). In all, 0.1% CellTox Green was
included in each well at the time of neo dosing. In total, 10% lysis solution
was used as a cell death control. Fluorescence was measured at various
time points with 485–510 nm excitation and 520–530 nm emission.

TCF reporter assay in monolayer cell culture and MCTS
TOPﬂash (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) was used to evaluate TCF
transcriptional activity in CRC cells. A total of 10 000 cells per well were
plated into 96-well plates and transfected with TransLT1 reagent (Mirus,
Madison, WI, USA). After 24 h, medium was replaced and cells were treated
with compounds as indicated for 6 h. Next, cells were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and a 1:1 ratio of PBS: One-Glo luciferase
reagent (Promega) was added and the luminescence was detected within
10 min. The experiment was repeated to measure viable cell protein
concentration after compound treatment, which was used to normalize
TOPﬂash luminescence to obtain the %TCF activity. Stable engineered cells
containing pCDH-TOPﬂash-luc-EF1-puro were used to generate MCTS
arrayed in 96-well plates and treated with DMSO or 10 μM neo for 72 h.
One-Glo and 3D-CellTiter-Glo (Promega) were used to determine the TCF
reporter activity in viable cells from MCTS. Experiments were replicated
twice (n = 3 for each replicate).

Co-immunoprecipitation
Cells were treated with DMSO or 10 μM neo for 6 h followed by generating
cytoplasmic and nuclear lysates. In all, 100 μl of 1 mg/ml nuclear extract was
saved and used as the input. IP was conducted with Dynabeads protein A IP
Kit (ThermoScientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA). Brieﬂy, 300 μg of lysate incubated
with 1–2 μg of the IP antibody was rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. In total, 50 μl of
beads were transferred to the preincubated antibody/lysate mixture followed
by overnight incubation at 4 °C. The ﬂowthrough was collected and the
beads were washed 3 × with PBST. Proteins were eluted with 20 μl of
50 mM glycine (pH = 2.8). Experiments were replicated twice.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
The methods used for ChIP were previously published62 and are detailed in
the Supplementary Information Materials and methods section. Experiments were replicated twice (n = 2 for quantitative PCR).

Clonogenic assay
SW620 cells were plated to allow for 70% conﬂuency within 24 h. Neo,
BAP-1 and DMSO were then added to cells for 24 h as pretreatment. A total
of 1000 viable cells per well were plated into a six-well plate and medium
was changed 2 × per week. After 10 days in culture, the medium was
removed and cells colonies were washed with PBS and ﬁxed with acetic
acid:methanol (1:7 v-v) at room temperature for 5 min. The ﬁxed colonies
were stained with 0.5% (w/v) crystal violet in 25% (v/v) methanol solution
for 2 h at room temperature. The stain was rinsed off with water and the
plate was air dried at room temperature. Digital pictures were taken
and the images were saved in greyscale (8-bit). Images were adjusted
for threshold with ImageJ software (Bethesda, MD, USA), the area of
analysis was circled and particles were analyzed by size (100–2000) and
circularity (0.5–1). In addition to pretreatment, we conducted the
clonogenic assay with continuous exposure to neo using the conditions
described in Figure 5c. Experiments were replicated twice (n = 2 for each
replicate).

Wound-healing and 3D invasion assays
HCT116 cells were plated in six replicates in an Essen Image Lock 96-well
plate (Essen BioSciences) at 60 000 cells per well and were allowed to

adhere for 24 h before scratching. Uniform wounds were made with the
Essen WoundMaker before treatment. Wound closures were monitored
with an Incycyte ZOOM imaging system (Essen BioSciences) by acquiring
images every 2 h over 72 h, and the relative wound density was analyzed
using the Scratch Would Analysis module (n = 6). To measure MCTS,
invasion cells were grown and treated in 3D as described. MCTS were
collected, washed with PBS, and disassociated into single-cell suspension
with 0.25% trypsin for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then neutralized with
complete medium, pelleted by centrifugation and 12 500 viable cells in
50 μl of RPMI-1640 + 0.1% fetal bovine serum were plated using the
Corning BioCoat Tumor Invasion System (Corning Inc.). A regular 96-well
tissue culture plate was used as a growth control with the same number of
cells plated at the same time. In all, 200 μl of RPMI-1640 + 10% fetal bovine
serum was used as the chemoattractant in each basal chamber. After
incubating for 72 h, medium was carefully removed from the apical
chambers and the insert system was transferred into a second 96-square
well-plate containing 200 μl per well of 4 μg/ml calcein AM in Hanks’
Balanced Salt solution. The plate was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and the
ﬂuorescence from invaded cells was measured (excitation 494 nm;
emission 517 nm). The growth of the cells was measured by SRB assay.33
The invaded cells to cell growth ratio was used to access the inhibition of
invasion by neo or etoposide (n = 4).

Animal studies
Four- to 6-week-old female athymic nude mice (Harlan Laboratories, Denver,
CO, USA) were anesthetized with isoﬂurane. Cells were injected at 2 500 000
cells per ﬂank in 50 μl medium + 50 μl Matrigel into both ﬂanks. Tumor size
was evaluated twice per week by caliper using the following formula: tumor
volume = (length × width2) × 0.52. Mice were killed at the end of the
experiment or when a single tumor volume reached 2000 mm3 or combined
tumors reached 3000 mm3. All protocols used were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Colorado,
Denver. SW620 cells stably transduced with TOPﬂash were used to generate
the xenograft mouse model (n = 20) and animals were randomized into three
groups (4 or 5 animals, 8 or 10 tumors per group) once the tumor volumes
reached 100 mm3. Animals without tumor or with tumor size 4200 mm3 at
the time of randomization were excluded from the study. Intratumoral
injections were conducted once per week by slowly injecting to the center of
each tumor with a 28-gauge insulin syringe while the mice were anesthetized
with isoﬂurane. The day after intratumoral injection, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 3 mg D-luciferin (Gold Biotechnology, St Louis, MO,
USA) in 200 μl PBS, and 5 min later mice were anesthetized with isoﬂurane for
5 min before imaged dorsally with the Xenogen IVIS 200 (PerkinElmer)
imaging system. Bioluminescence activity in photons/s was measured using
Living Image software (PerkinElmer). Tumor volume measurements were
conducted blinded.

Statistical analysis
Data were subjected to unpaired two-tailed or paired Student’s t-test
statistical analysis using Prism (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA).
All experiments were replicated two times (n = 3 for each replicate) unless
otherwise described.
