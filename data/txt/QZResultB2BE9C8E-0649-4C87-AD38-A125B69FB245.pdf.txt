ABSTRACT:
The cancer chemopreventive property of Chinese herb new isolate
isorhapontigenin (ISO) and mechanisms underlying its activity have never been
explored. Here we demonstrated that ISO treatment with various concentrations for
3 weeks could dramatically inhibit TPA/EGF-induced cell transformation of Cl41 cells
in Soft Agar assay, whereas co-incubation of cells with ISO at the same concentrations
could elicit G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest without redundant cytotoxic effects on nontransformed cells. Further studies showed that ISO treatment resulted in cyclin D1
downregulation in dose- and time-dependent manner. Our results indicated that ISO
regulated cyclin D1 at transcription level via targeting JNK/C-Jun/AP-1 activation.
Moreover, we found that ISO-inhibited JNK/C-Jun/AP-1 activation was mediated
by both upregulation of MKP-1 expression through increasing its mRNA stability
and deactivating MKK7. Most importantly, MKP-1 knockdown could attenuate ISOmediated suppression of JNK/C-Jun activation and cyclin D1 expression, as well as
G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and cell transformation inhibition, while ectopic expression of
FLAG-cyclin D1 T286A mutant also reversed ISO-induced G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest and
inhibition of cell transformation. Our results demonstrated that ISO is a promising
chemopreventive agent via upregulating mkp-1 mRNA stability, which is distinct from
its cancer therapeutic effect with downregulation of XIAP and cyclin D1 expression.

INTRODUCTION

Isorhapontigenin (ISO) is a new derivative
of stilbene isolated from the Chinese herb Gnetum
Cleistostachyum [8]. ISO was also recently identified
from wine grapes that are the main dietary source of
stilbene [9]. Despite several investigations on biological
properties of ISO such as its antioxidant effect [10-11],
the anti-cancer activity of this compound has not been
evaluated until quite recently, and it has been found that
ISO triggers apoptosis in multiple human cancer cell
lines [12-13]. Mechanistically, ISO treatment is shown
to downregulate XIAP and cyclin D1 expression by
promoting transcription factor Sp1 protein degradation
[12-13]. However, ISO chemopreventive effects have not
been explored thus far. In the current study, therefore, we

Albeit intensive efforts that have focused on
therapeutics development, cancer is still a leading
health problem worldwide [1]. In past few decades, the
concept of chemoprevention has emerged and become
a new strategy in fighting against cancers [2-4]. World
Health Organization (WHO) indicates that at least 30%
of all cancer deaths are preventable [5]. Since diverse
phytochemicals were reported to interfere with a specific
stage of the carcinogenic process, numerous efforts
have been devoted to identifying phytochemicals and
phytochemical-derived agents with cancer preventive
properties [4, 6-7].

ISO downregulation of cyclin D1 expression was
responsible for its induction of G0/G1 phase
arrest and inhibition of cell transformation

using TPA/EGF-induced mouse Cl41 cell transformation
model sought to investigate the potential chemopreventive
activity of ISO and molecular mechanisms underlying its
activity. We found that ISO was capable of inhibiting TPA/
EGF-induced cell transformation with induction of G0/G1
cell-cycle arrest by downregulating cyclin D1 transcription
via both upregulating MKP-1 expression and deactivating
MKK7/JNK cascade.

To delineate the molecular basis of ISO-induced
inhibition of cell transformation and reversion of G1/S
phase transition due to TPA or EGF treatment, we
performed Western blot analysis to probe the molecular
targets that could be potentially regulated by this
phytochemical. Cells were pretreated with ISO in different
concentrations for 30 min and then co-incubated with
TPA/EGF for 24 hours. The data showed that cyclin D1,
a pivotal regulator of G1/S phase progression [14], was
significantly downregulated by ISO in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, time course analysis
by Western blot revealed that induction of cyclin D1
expression by TPA or EGF was profoundly reduced by
50 μM of ISO at 24 hours in comparison to those in the
cells treated with TPA/EGF alone (Figs. 2B and 2C). In
contrast, the expression of anti-apoptotic protein XIAP
and transcription factor Sp1, which has shown to be
suppressed by ISO in human cancer cells [12], was not
affected upon ISO treatment in Cl41 cells (Fig. 2A). These
data suggested a distinct molecular mechanism of the ISO
chemopreventive activity in non-transformed Cl41 cells.
To further prove that ISO downregulation of cyclin
D1 protein expression was responsible for the induction of
G0/G1 phase arrest and inhibition of cell transformation,
Cl41 cells stably transfected with the plasmid encoding
FLAG-cyclin D1 T286A mutant, which is refractory to
phosphorylation by GSK-3β and thus this point mutation
impairs the cyclin D1 proteasomal degradation [15],were
established and utilized to test the contribution of cyclin
D1 downregulation to the inhibition of cell transformation
and induction of G0/G1 phase arrest due to ISO treatment.
Overexpression of FLAG-cyclin D1 T286A mutant in the
stable transfectant of Cl41 cells was verified as indicated
in Fig. 2D. Although ISO treatment did not reduce
expression level of FLAG-cyclin D1 T286A mutant,
It markedly blocked endogenous cyclin D1 expression
(Fig. 2E). As expected, ectopic expression of FLAGcyclin D1 T286A mutant substantially assisted to bypass
ISO-induced G0/G1 phase arrest and attenuated the ISO
inhibition of cell transformation induced by TPA or EGF
(Fig. 2F-2I), thereby buttressing that ISO-downregulated
cyclin D1 expression accounted for its induction of G0/
G1 phase arrest and inhibition of cell transformation in
Cl41 cells.

RESULTS
ISO inhibited cell transformation and induced
G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest with no redundant
cytotoxic effects on non-transformed cells
To investigate the potential chemopreventive activity
of ISO, TPA/EGF-induced Cl41 cell transformation model
was employed. Given that ISO could reduce cell viability
in T24T bladder cancer cells with an approximate IC50
of 55 μM [12], we thus treated mouse epidermal Cl41
cells with ISO in concentrations of 30, 40, and 50 μM
with exposure to TPA/EGF. As shown in Figs. 1A and 1B,
co-incubation of cells with ISO for 3 weeks significantly
inhibited TPA/EGF-induced anchorage-independent
colony formation in a dose-dependent manner in Cl41
cells, indicating that ISO is a potential preventive agent.
To further explore whether the inhibitory effect of ISO
on cell transformation is due to its induction of apoptosis
and/or cell cycle arrest, high-resolution flow cytometry
analysis of PI-stained nuclei was performed. The data
revealed that treatment of cells with ISO at the same
concentrations for 48 hours was capable of significantly
reversing TPA/EGF-induced G1/S phase progression in a
dose-dependent manner, whereas almost no apoptosis was
triggered under the same experimental condition (Figs.
1C and 1D). Considering that an ideal chemopreventive
agent should be able to impart apoptotic/anti proliferative
effects specifically in carcinogen/tumor promoter-treated
cells without affecting normal cells [6], we thus evaluate
the cytotoxic effect of ISO on normal non-transformed
Cl41 cells using ATPase assay. The data showed that
ISO did not exert any notable growth inhibition at the
concentration range 30-50 μM at 48 hours after the
treatment (Fig. 1E). These results demonstrated that ISO
could remarkably inhibit the growth of transformed Cl41
cells via arresting G1/S progression without redundant
cytotoxic effects on non-transformed cells.

ISO inhibited cyclin D1 transcription via
abolishing C-Jun/AP-1 activation
To clarify the underlying mechanism of cyclin
D1 downregulation by ISO, we examined cyclin d1
mRNA level and the transcriptional activity of cyclin D1

promoter after cells were co-treated with ISO and TPA/
EGF. RT-PCR analysis and luciferase reporter assay
demonstrated that ISO treatment resulted in the reduction
of TPA- or EGF-induced both cyclin d1 mRNA level and
its promoter-dependent transcriptional activity in a dosedependent manner (Figs. 3A and 3B), suggesting that ISO
was capable of suppressing cyclin D1 transcription in Cl41
cells.
To identify the transcription factor responsible
for ISO downregulation of cyclin D1 transcription,
we evaluated the changes in the nuclear translocation
of related transcription factors upon ISO treatment
for 9 hours. Compared to cells treated with TPA/EGF
alone, cells pretreated with 50 μM of ISO displayed
the substantial reduction of c-Jun phosphorylation at
Ser63 and Ser73 in the nuclear protein extract, whereas
c-Jun total protein expression was not affected by ISO
(Fig. 3C). Meanwhile, no significant suppression of
other transcription factors, including Sp1, NF-kB p65
or p50, NFAT1, CREB, Jun-D, Jun-B, and C-fos was
observed following ISO treatment (Fig. 3C). These
data suggested that ISO was able to specifically inhibit
c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63 and Ser73. To further
substantiate this finding, the inhibitory effect of ISO on
c-Jun phosphorylation was examined by means of the time
course studies. In comparison to cells treated with TPA/
EGF at the corresponding time point, cells with 50 μM
ISO pretreatment presented the decreased phosphorylation
of c-Jun at Ser63 and Ser73 at approximately 12-24 hours
(Figs. 3D and 3E). It was noted that ISO had no impact
on c-Jun total expression, although TPA or EGF treatment
led to increase in total protein expression (Figs. 3D and
3E).These results together demonstrated that ISO was
indeed capable of suppressing c-Jun phosphorylation and
activation.
C-Jun is a major component of transcription
factor AP-1. We next examined ISO’s effect on AP-1
transactivation in Cl41 cells stably transfected with AP-1luciferase reporter containing seven tandem AP-1 binding
sites[16]. As anticipated, ISO treatment significantly
blocked AP-1 transactivation in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 3F). To determine whether ISO-suppressed cyclin
D1 transcription was mediated by c-Jun/AP-1, we tested
the effect of ISO on cyclin D1 transcription in Cl41 cells
stably transfected with luciferase reporter containing
cyclin D1 promoters with mutated AP-1 binding sites
in compared to that with WT cyclin D1 promoter
luciferase reporter. As indicated in Fig. 3G, treatment of
cells with either TPA or EGF led to 4 fold induction of
cyclin D1 promoter activity in WT cyclin D1 promoter
reporter transfectant, and the induction was crippled in
the transfectants of AP-1 binding site-mutated cyclin D1
promoter-luciferase reporter. Moreover, co-incubation of
cells with ISO exhibited a marked inhibition of cyclin
D1 promoter activity in WT cyclin D1 promoter reporter
transfectant, whereas it did not show significant effect in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

AP-1 binding site-mutated cyclin D1 promoter-luciferase
reporter (Fig. 3G).Thus, our results strongly implicated
that ISO treatment resulted in the suppression of TPA/
EGF-induced c-Jun/AP-1 activation, which would in turn
inhibit cyclin D1 transcription in Cl41 cells.

ISO treatment upregulated MKP-1 expression
and deactivated MKK7/JNK cascade
The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs),
including ERK, p38, and JNK, have been proven as
activators of c-Jun/AP-1 in many cellular settings [1720]. We thus tested whether TPA/EGF-induced MAPKs
activation could be deactivated by ISO in Cl41 cells. The
results showed that ISO treatment downregulated the
TPA/EGF-induced phosphorylation of JNK at 6-24 hours,
but did not affect JNK total expression. By contrast, the
induction of phosphorylation of ERK and p38 by TPA/
EGF was not impacted by ISO treatment (Figs. 4A and
4B). These data indicated that ISO could selectively
deactivate TPA/EGF-induced JNK activation. Given that
MKK4 and MKK7 are the two upstream kinases required
for JNK full activation [21-23], we next tested whether
ISO treatment could likewise attenuate TPA/EGF-induced
phosphorylation of MKK4 and MKK7 along the time
course. As a consequence, only the obvious reduction of
MKK7 phosphorylation was observed when cells were
treated with ISO, while MKK7 total expression did not
change (Figs. 4A and 4B), thereby suggesting that MKK7
might be a kinase involved in the deactivation of JNK by
ISO.
In addition to kinases, phosphatases might be also
involved in JNK deactivation upon ISO treatment. Thus,
time course analysis was performed to test whether
potential phosphatases are induced by ISO treatment. As
shown in Figs. 5A and 5B, ISO treatment upregulated
MKP-1 expression, but did not affect the expression
of other phosphatases, including PHLPP1, PP2A-A,
PP2A-B, and PTEN. Given that MKP-1 is a phosphatase
that could directly regulate JNK phosphorylation [24-25],
our results indicated that ISO treatment resulted in MKP1
induction, which might subsequently deactivate JNK
phosphorylation induced by TPA/EGF.

MKP-1 knockdown attenuated ISO inhibition of
c-Jun/JNK, suppression of cyclin D1 expression,
G0/G1 growth arrest and inhibition of cell
transformation in Cl41 cells
To further confirm that MKP-1 acted as the
precursor regulating the JNK/c-Jun pathway responsible
for cyclin D1 downregulation and growth inhibition
following ISO treatment, MKP-1 was knocked down
in Cl41 cells with a short hairpin RNAi construct that
specifically targeted mkp-1. Knockdown of MKP1 in

two stable mass transfectants was verified in Fig. 5C. As
a result, cyclin D1 downregulation and the reduction of
phosphorylated c-Jun and JNK by ISO treatment were
abrogated in MKP-1 knockdown cells in comparison to
that from nonsense transfectant (Fig. 5D). Furthermore,
MKP-1 knockdown also reversed ISO-caused G0/G1
cell cycle arrest and inhibition of cell transformation
in Cl41 cells (Fig. 5E-5H). Taken together, our results
demonstrated a critical role of MKP-1 in the inhibition of
the JNK/c-Jun cascade and in turn downmodulates cyclin
D1 expression, as well as induction G0/G1 arrest and
inhibition of cell transformation following ISO treatment.

reporter was transfected into Cl41 cells and the MKP-1
promoter activity in the transfectant was determined in the
cells treated with ISO followed TPA or EGF. As shown
in Fig. 6B, ISO treatment significantly downregulated
MKP-1 promoter activity, suggesting ISO treatment
might upregulate MKP-1 expression via increase mkp-1
mRNA stability. This notion was greatly supported by the
results showing that pretreatment of cells with ISO for 6
hours followed by the treatment of actinomycin D for 20
min increased mkp-1 mRNA half-life (T1/2 increased to
42 min) in comparison to that observed in cells treated
with actinomycin D alone (T1/2=14 min) (Figs. 6C& 6D).
Thus, our data proved that ISO treatment stabilized mkp-1
mRNA stability.
Several RNA-binding proteins, e.g. HNRPD,
VHL, Hur, and Nucleolin, have been reported to bind
their target mRNA and increased mRNA stability [2628]. We hence tested whether any of these proteins was
involved in ISO upregulation of mkp-1 mRNA stability.
Western blot analysis showed that ISO treatment could
clearly increase the Nucleolin expression, and moreover
Nucleolin protein upregulation was associated with the
MKP-1 protein induction along the time course studies
(Fig. 6E), suggesting that Nucleolin might participated
in the increased mkp-1 mRNA stability following ISO
treatment.

ISO treatment increased mkp-1 mRNA stability
To elucidate mechanism underlying ISO
upregulation of MKP-1 expression, we determined mkp-1
mRNA level following co-incubation of ISO with either
TPA or EGF. The results revealed that mkp-1 mRNA level
was inhibited in Cl41 cells following either TAP or EGF
treatment (Fig. 6A). However, this inhibition by TPA or
EGF was completely reversed to the level that is even
higher than basal level by co-incubation of cells with
ISO, suggesting that ISO upregulated MKP-1 expression
at either transcription or mRNA stability. To address
this question, the MKP-1 promoter-driven luciferase

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Further study indicated that ISO-upregulated MKP-1
expression mediated the inhibition of JNK/C-Jun/AP-1
activation and in turn led to cyclin D1 downregulation,
G1/S cell-cycle arrest, and cell transformation inhibition.
Therefore, we identified a novel function of ISO as a
cancer chemopreventive agent that is mediated through a
molecular mechanism distinct from that responsible for
ISO cancer therapeutic effect.
Abnormal expression of cyclin D1 has been reported
in many human cancers [29]. Particularly, cyclin d1
mRNA amplification has been observed in approximately
45% breast carcinomas [30]. It is also reported that more
than 50% patients presented cyclin D1 overexpression in
a total of 307 patients with non-melanocytic skin cancer
[31]. Cyclin D1 has been shown to play a crucial role
in cancer development, especially skin carcinogenesis
[32-33]. Transgenic mice with conditional cyclin D1

The naturally occurring compound ISO [8] has
been proved to possess anti-cancer activities against
multiple human cancer cell lines [12]. Mechanistic
studies revealed that ISO downregulation of XIAP and
cyclin D1 protein expression accounted for its anti-cancer
effects in human cancer cells [12-13]. In the current
study, we investigated potential cancer chemopreventive
activity of this phytochemical by exploring its potential
inhibitory effect on cell transformation in Cl41 cells.
Our results demonstrated that ISO treatment was capable
of inhibiting TPA/EGF-induced colony formation via
upregulating MKP-1 expression and arresting G1/S cellcycle progression, whereas it did not produce redundant
cytotoxic effects on normal non-transformed cells, thereby
suggesting the cancer chemopreventive activity of ISO.

overexpression are much easier to develop skin tumor
when exposed to dimethylbenz[a]anthracene [33]. Also,
cyclin D1 knockdown was capable of attenuating arseniteinduced cell transformation in mouse Cl41 cells and
human HaCat cells [34-35]. Hence, cyclin D1 has been
regarded as an important player in cancer development
as well as a target for cancer prevention and therapy
[36]. Our previous study, for example, has reported that
suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is able to inhibit
EGF-induced cell transformation through reduction of
cyclin d1 mRNA stability [37]. In the present study, we
found that ISO inhibition of cell transformation and cell
cycle progression in Cl41 cells was mediated through
downregulation of cyclin D1 protein expression. Further
investigation proved that ISO regulated cyclin D1 through
inhibiting its transcription, and this process was mediated
through the suppression of its transcription factor c-Jun/
AP-1 activation via a novel mechanism, i.e. upregulating
MKP-1 expression.
MKK7/JNK/AP-1 cascade is an important
oncogenic signaling pathway [1, 38]. Murine genetic
loss-of-function studies have demonstrated that targets
of JNK signaling cascade, particularly c-Jun and c-fos,
may contribute to chemical-induced murine epidermal
neoplasia [39-41]. JNK/AP-1 has been reported to play a
role in inducing aberrant cell proliferation associated with
human skin carcinogenesis [38-43]. Moreover, previous
studies have also reported that TNFR1/MKK7/JNK/AP-1
cascade promoted human neoplasia and inhibition of this
pathway represented a potential therapeutic approach
for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) [38]. Therefore, the
discovery in the current investigation that ISO could
inhibit the activation of MKK7/JNK/c-Jun/AP-1 cascade
triggered by TPA/EGF in Cl41 mouse epidermal cells
reveals the application of this phytochemical for the
cancer prevention.
In addition to MKK7, phosphatase MKP-1 was also
shown to be upregulated and mediate JNK deactivation
following ISO treatment. Further results indicated that
ISO treatment could augment mkp-1 mRNA stability.
Yet, although our data suggested that Nucleolin might
be involved in the stabilization of mkp-1 mRNA, which
has never been reported before, the detailed mechanism
underlying this process remains elusive and thus is
currently underway of investigation in our laboratory. On
the other hand, it is intriguing that albeit with profoundly
decreased promoter activity, mkp-1 mRNA level was
upregulated following ISO treatment. This seemingly
paradox might be due to fact that MKP-1 is regulated
by c-Jun, which has been reported in sympathetic
neurons [44] and thus c-Jun deactivation might result in
the downregulation of MKP-1 promoter transcriptional
activity following ISO treatment. But the detailed
mechanism responsible for ISO downregulation of MKP1 transcription in Cl41 cells is still under investigation.
In summary, our studies demonstrated that ISO
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

exerted an inhibitory effect of TPA/EGF-induced cell
transformation with induction G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest
in Cl41 cells. Mechanistic insight into cell-cycle arrest
induction suggested that this inhibitory effect is through
MKP-1 upregulation and MKK7 deactivation, both of
which would concertedly deactivate JNK/c-Jun cascade,
thereby leading to cyclin D1 downregulation (Fig. 6F).
These findings implicate the potential utilization of ISO
as a cancer chemopreventive agent.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Cell Culture and Reagents
Mouse epidermal Cl41 cells and their transfectants
were cultured in 5% Fetal bovine Serum (FBS) MEM
containing with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM
L-glutamine (Life Technologies). Cells were maintained
in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2
atmosphere[45]. The antibodies specific against phosphoc-Jun, c-Jun, phospho-JNKs, JNKs, phospho-ERKs,
ERKs, phospho-p38, p38, phospho-MKK7, MKK7,
phospho-MKK4, MKK4, PP2A A subunit, XIAP, SP1,
β-Actin and GAPDH were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology Inc (Beverly, MA). The antibodies specific
against cyclin D1, c-Fos, CREB, Fra1, p-NF-kB p65, NFkB p50, JunD, JunB, PTEN and MKP-1 were bought from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibody
against FLAG was obtained from Covance Inc. (Princeton,
NJ). The antibodies against phospho-PP2A and PP2A B
subunit were purchased from Epitomics (Burlingame,

Plasmids and Cell Transfection
The -963cyclin D1 promoter-driven luciferase
reporter and its AP-1 binding site mutant were kindly
provided by Dr. Richard G Pestell (Thomas Jefferson
University Jefferson Medical College) [46-47]. The
cyclin D1 promoter region containing -963 to +14 was
subcloned into the pA3LUC and named as the -963 cyclin
D1 promoter-driven Luciferase reporter (-963CD1). The
-963 CD1AP-1 mt was derived from -963CD1 with two
nucleotide mutation within AP-1 binding site of the cyclin
D1 promoter. The MKP-1 promoter-driven luciferase
reporter was a gift from Dr. Yusen Liu (National Institutes
of Health) [48]. Cyclin D1 promoter-driven luciferase
reporter was described in our previously study [49]. The
AP-1-driven luciferase reporter containing seven tandem
AP-1 binding sites (TGACTAA) was purchased from
2673

Oncotarget

Cell Proliferation Assay

Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). FLAG–cyclin D1 T286A/
pCMV5 expression vector was a gift of Dr. Udit N.
Verma (University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center at Dallas) [50]. The specific small-interference
RNA (siRNA) vector targeted mouse mkp1 (dusp1) was
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical (St. Louis, MO).
Stable co-transfections were performed with specific
cDNA constructs together with pSUPER-puro vector
using PolyJetTM DNA In Vitro Transfection Reagent
(SignaGen Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. For stable transfection
selection, cultures were subjected to puromycin selection
for 4–6 weeks, and surviving cells were pooled as stable
mass transfectants. These stable transfectants were
cultured in the selected antibiotic-free medium for at least
two passages before utilization for experiments[51-53].

Confluent monolayers of Cl41 cells were trypsinized
and 2×103 viable cells suspended in 100 μl MEM
supplemented with 5% FBS were added to each well of
96-well plates. After adherent, cells were synchronized by
replacing the medium containing 0.1% FBS for 24 hours,
and then replacing culture medium containing 1% FBS
with or without ISO, and cells treated with ISO at indicated
doses were cultured for 48 hours. The viability of the
cells was determined using CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent
Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with a
luminometer (Wallac 1420 Victor 2 multipliable counter
system). The results were presented as proliferation index
(relative luminescence signal to medium control)[56-57].

Western Blotting

Anchorage-independent Growth Assay

Cell extracts were prepared with cell lysis buffer
(10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, and 1 mM Na3VO4)
and protein concentrations were determined by NanoDrop
1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington,
DE). 30～80 μg of protein sample from the cell extracts
were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE),
transferred, and probed with indicated antibody. The
protein band that was specifically bound to the primary
antibody was detected using an alkaline phosphataselinked secondary antibody and an ECF Western blotting
system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ)[47, 5859].

Soft agar assay was performed as described
previously [54]. Briefly, 2.5 ml of 0.5% agar in basal
modified Eagle’s medium (BMEM) supplemented with
10% FBS with or without ISO, EGF, TPA, EGF+ISO
or TPA+ISO respectively was layered onto each well
of 6-well tissue culture plates. 1×104 Cl41 cells or their
transfectants were mixed with 1 ml of 0.5% agar BMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS with or without EGF/TPA
and ISO, and then layered on top of the 0.5% agar layer.
The plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 3
weeks. The colonies with more than 32 cells were scored
and the results were presented as colonies/104 cells[45, 47,
51].

RT-PCR

Flow Cytometry Assay

Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and cDNAs
were synthesized with the ThermoScript RT-PCR
system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The mouse
cyclin d1 cDNA fragments were amplified by
primers 5’-TCCCTTGACTGCCGAGAAG-3’ and
5’-AGACCAGCCTCTTCCTCCAC-3’. The primers for
mouse mkp-1 are 5’-GAA GCG TTT TCG GCT TCC TG3’ and 5’- AGG TAA GCA AGG CAG ATG GTG-3’. The
primers for mouse gapdh are 5’-GGA GGT TGT CAT
CCC TCAGA-3’ and 5’-TCC TCC TCA GCC ACA CTC
TT-3’. The primers for mouse β-actin are 5’-ATA TCG
CTG CGC TGG TCG TC-3’ and 5’-AGG ATG GCG TGA
GGG AGA GC-3’. The PCR products were separated onto
3% agarose gels, stained with EB, and scanned the images
from a UV light as described previously[45, 52, 60-61].

Cells (1×105) were cultured in each well of 6-well
plates till 60-70% confluence with normal culture medium.
Cells were synchronized by the replacing the medium
containing 0.1% FBS for 24 hours, and then replacing
medium containing 1% FBS with or without EGF/TPA
and ISO, and cultured for another 24 hours as indicated in
figure legends. The cells were harvested and fixed with 3
ml of ice-cold 80% ethanol overnight. The fixed cells were
washed twice with PBS, and then suspended in Propidium
Iodide staining solution (Propidium Iodide 50 mg /ml,
RNAse A 10 mg /ml, and 0.1% Triton X-100) (SigmaAldrich Chemical, St. Louis, MO) for at least 1 hour at
4°C. The DNA content was determined by means of Flow
Cytometric Analysis with the Epics XL FACS (Beckman
Coulter, Miami, FL) and EXPO 32 software as described
previously [45, 51, 55].

Luciferase Assay
Cl41 cells were transfected with the indicated
luciferase reporter construct in combination with the pRL-

TK vector (Promega, Madison, WI) as an internal control.
The transfectants were seeded into 96-well plates. After
the cell density reached 70-80%, cells were treated as
indicated in the figure legends, and were then extracted
with luciferase assay lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI).
The luciferase activity was determined by the microplate
luminometer LB 96V (Berthold GmbH & Co. KG, Bad
Wildbad, Germany) using the luciferase assay system
(Promega Corp., Madison, WI) as described [53, 61-62].
