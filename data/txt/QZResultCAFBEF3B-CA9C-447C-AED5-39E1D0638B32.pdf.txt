found to be a key plasticity gene in aggressive tumor
cells. Down-regulation of Nodal in this plastic phenotype
results in reversion to a lineage specific cell type and
tumor suppression [8].
Targeting tumor reversion genes in order to induce a
suppression of the malignant phenotype has already led to
the identification of a series of anti-histaminic, neuroleptic
and anti-depressive drugs that inhibit intra-cellular levels
of TCTP, a key gene in tumor reversion [9]. Other genes
such as PS1, a predisposition gene to familial Alzheimer’s
disease targeted by gamma-secretase inhibitors are tested
in Kaposi sarcoma patients [4].
Tumor reversion as used here in Noda’s study [10]
can be a fast-track for the identification of new anti-cancer
drugs when we are still far away from understanding how
reversion functions at the molecular level, and this is a
major future challenge.

In the present issue of the journal, Makoto Noda
and colleagues present a screening assay for anti-cancer
drugs based on tumor reversion, identifying a series of
hitherto unsuspected compounds that are of potential
therapeutic interest. More specifically, the assay is
based upon triggering the promoter of Reck, which
functions as an inhibitor of metalloproteinases. Among
the pharmaceutical agents that were able to activate the
Reck promoter, 1/3 were known anti-cancer drugs which
act through different cytopathic mechanisms. The second
group comprises drugs that inhibit growth of bacteria,
plasmodium falciparum, fungi and worms. The third
category consists of “drugs related to the function of the
central nervous system”.
Now, here comes the interesting and original idea
of the paper. Activation of Reck induces “flat revertants”
and Noda used this system already to clone the K-rev
gene [1, 2]. Flat revertants have a history of their own
that started when investigators in the early 1960s used
the NIH3T3 cells to assay the transforming potential
of oncoviruses and oncogenes. A couple of years later
in 1968, when Robert Pollack stepped into the field,
he made a remarkable observation. Some of the cells
infected with SV40 or polyoma viruses no longer showed
the typical oncogenic phenotype, but instead, acquired
a flat morphology [3]. These cells had also lost their
oncogenic potential and were therefore named “flat
revertants”. This reversion of the malignant phenotype
was in line with the experiments initiated by Askanazy in
teratocarcinoma cells at the beginning of the 20th century
and later expanded to different species and cell types
[4]. The most spectacular tumor reversion experiments
have been carried out in plants by Braun [4]. Various
approaches, using different biological systems [5, 6 ,7]
led to the identification of at least 300 genes that could
be implicated in the tumor reversion process, including
siah1, PS1, TSAP6, TCTP, Integrin receptors, and Nodal.
Interestingly, Nodal is an embryonic morphogen recently
