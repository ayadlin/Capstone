ABSTRACT
Majority of CHRONIC myeloid leukemia patients experience an adequate
therapeutic effect from imatinib however, 26–37% of patients discontinue imatinib
therapy due to a suboptimal response or intolerance. Here we investigated derivatives
of apoptin, a chicken anemia viral protein with selective toxicity towards cancer cells,
which can be directed towards inhibiting multiple hyperactive kinases including BCRABL1. Our earlier studies revealed that a proline-rich segment of apoptin interacts
with the SH3 domain of fusion protein BCR-ABL1 (p210) and acts as a negative
regulator of BCR-ABL1 kinase and its downstream targets. In this study we show
for the first time, the therapeutic potential of apoptin-derived decapeptide for the
treatment of CML by establishing the minimal region of apoptin interaction domain
with BCR-ABL1. We further show that the apoptin decapeptide is able to inhibit BCRABL1 down stream target c-Myc with a comparable efficacy to full-length apoptin and
Imatinib. The synthetic apoptin is able to inhibit cell proliferation in murine (32Dp210),
human cell line (K562), and ex vivo in both imatinib-resistant and imatinib sensitive
CML patient samples. The apoptin based single or combination therapy may be an
additional option in CML treatment and eventually be feasible as curative therapy.

breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene from chromosome 9
being positioned next to the c-abl oncogene 1 (ABL1)
in chromosome 22. The leukemogenic properties of
BCR-ABL1 originate from the constitutive tyrosine
kinase activity of the ABL1-encoded part of the protein
in combination with a region in the BCR moiety that
facilitates dimerization of BCR-ABL1. Dimerized BCRABL1 autophosphorylates itself at tyrosine residues that
promote the recruitment and activation of the intracellular
signaling protein complex of growth factor receptor-bound
protein 2 (GRB2), GRB2-associated binding protein 2
(GAB2) and son-of-sevenless (SOS). The activated GRB2/
GAB2/SOS complex in turn activates several downstream
signaling cascades including the RAS/mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK), signal transducer and activator of
transcription 5 (STAT5) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K)/AKT pathways [2, 3]. Collectively, these pathways
influence genetic transcription so that uncontrolled cell
survival, proliferation, and anti-apoptotic pathways are
promoted and the CML cell clone has been created.
The first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib
binds to and block the ATP-binding pocket of the BCRABL1 protein, thereby preventing the essential access
of ATP for tyrosine kinase activity [4, 5]. Consequently,
imatinib shuts down all downstream signaling events
from BCR-ABL1 and specifically inhibits survival of
CML cells. Although imatinib is a superior therapeutic
alternative compared to all previously investigated
options, there is still room for improvements as 20-30%
of patients develop resistance to imatinib [6] and 7-9%
of patients progress into accelerated phase (AP) or blast
crises (BC) on imatinib treatment during five years of
first-line treatment [7, 8]. Furthermore, 10% of patients
discontinue imatinib therapy due to adverse effects [9].
The second generation TKIs (2GTKIs) induce deeper and
faster molecular and cytogenetic responses than imatinib.
In spite of this, there is no clear improvement in overall
survival. Therefore, targeting multiple signaling pathways
is necessary for an improved therapeutic outcome [10].
Apoptin is a 14 KD viral protein (chicken anemia
virus protein-3, VP3) and known to induce apoptosis with
selective toxicity towards cancer cells. Apoptin mediated
cell toxicity is dependent on its cellular localization, as
nuclear localization promote cell death while cytoplasmic
presence does not render such cell death [11, 12]. Studies
from our lab and several others show the p53-independent,
mitochondrial mediated caspase-3 dependent cell death
by apoptin among cancer cells [13-15]. Several apoptin
interacting molecules including Nur77, BCL-family,
Anaphase promoting complex (APC) and PI3K signaling
pathways are studied in the process to unravel the cancer
cell specific toxicity of apoptin [13, 14, 16-18].
Our previous studies indicated that Apoptin interacts
and inhibits Abl/BCR-ABL1 and its various downstream
targets including STAT5, CrkL and c-Myc [19]. Here we
describe the identification of apoptin and its derivatives
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

as specific interacting elements with the SH3-domain
of BCR-ABL1. We further map the region of apoptin
responsible for its interaction with BCR-ABL1 using
various deletion mutants of apoptin and confirm
interaction of apoptin-derived constructs with Abl/ BCRABL1 by GST-apoptin pull-down assay. Furthermore, we
designed a decapeptide spanning the apoptin-interaction
domain, and tested its toxicity towards BCR-ABL1
positive and control cells. Inspired by the results on the
established cell lines we tested the toxicity of apoptin
derived decapeptide on the CML patient derived blood
samples and show its effective function even among the
imatinib resistant patient primary samples. Thus, with
this study we provide apoptin-derived decapeptide as a
better alternative therapeutic agent for the treatment of
leukemia (or complement as combination therapy) as
opposed to TKI to which cells often develop resistance.
Since BCR-ABL1 is not expressed in normal cells apoptin
decapeptide will be an ideal drug target as it leaves normal
cells  unaffected by acting as a selective BCR-ABL1
inhibitor.

RESULTS
Apoptin induces apoptosis in BCR-ABL1 positive
and immortalized cells
Apoptin triggers the activation of caspases via the
intrinsic/mitochondrial death pathway, and not the death
receptor/extrinsic pathway in cancer cells [15]. To further
verify the nature of apoptin induced cell death among
BCR-ABL1 expressing leukemia cells, we compared
nuclear morphology of the apoptin/imatinib untreated and
treated 32DDSMZ and 32Dp210 cells to study the features
of apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, we estimated
the presence of cleaved PARP-1, which is a key target of
activated caspase-3, or -7 in pro-apoptotic cells by Western
blot analysis and immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1a and 1b).
In these experiments, the characteristic apoptotic nuclear
morphology and presence of cleaved PARP-1 in the
cytoplasm of apoptin treated 32Dp210 cells clearly indicate
the induction of apoptosis following the application of
apoptin (Fig. 1a and 1b).
To study the biological activity of the cellpenetrating Tat-apoptin on 32p210 cells expressing
BCR-ABL1p210, we treated with Tat-apoptin (1μM) and
cell survival was assessed by MTT assay at different
time points. Treatment of 32p210 cell lines with either TatApoptin or the positive control Imatinib caused significant
cell death (p < 0.03) as compared to the negative control
group receiving Tat-GFP treatment (Fig. 1c). This result
further confirms the very nature of anti-proliferative
effect of apoptin that does not rely on a single target, but it
instead affects multiple cell growth pathways and thus the
development of apoptin resistance is less likely.

which indicated that apoptin strongly interacts with the

The above observation was further confirmed by GSTapoptin and BCR-ABL1p210 ‘pull-down assay’ using both
BCR-ABL1-positive (32Dp210), and -negative (32DDSMZ)

with the SH3 domains of a series of proteins we first
performed a protein array-based study. Several wellcharacterized SH3 domains were previously identified as
the potential sites critical to ligand binding on the basis
of alignment with their structures [20]. We performed a
high stringency SH3 domain interaction array screening,

normalized average. As shown in figure 4a apoptin derived
decapeptide treatment does not show any significant
cellular toxicity among 32DDSMZ as compared to control
and scrambled peptide treated cells. However, apoptinderived decapeptide induced significant inhibition of cell
proliferation and/or cell death among 32Dp210 as shown
in figure 4b compared to control and scrambled peptide
treated counterparts. These results further confirm the antiproliferative effect of apoptin and apoptin derived peptides
mediated through their SH3 domain interacting proline rich
regions. Interestingly, similar peptide treatments on the
BCR-ABL1p210 expressing K562 cells also have similar
results (Fig. 4c).
Inspired from these in vitro results, we further tested
the anti-proliferative effect of apoptin-derived decapeptide
(PKPPSKKRSC) on imatinib sensitive (N=3) and
imatinib resistant (N=3) patient samples and compared
to cells derived from healthy donors (N=3). All the
experiments were conducted along with scrambled peptide
(PRRPSRSPKC) as a control treatment and Imatinib as
a positive control. As shown in figure 4e and 4f apoptin
derived decapeptide treatment (1μM and 2μM) for 36 h and
48 h respectively showed decreased cell survival among
imatinib responsive and resistant patient samples without
showing any difference among healthy samples. Hence,
Imatinib treatment (1μM) did not cause any significant
difference in cell survival among imatinib resistant patient
derived samples but did show significant decrease in cell
survival among responsive samples (Fig. 4d-f). Scrambled
peptide treatment at similar concentration as apoptin
decapeptide (1μM and 2μM) did not show any significant
difference in cell survival among the samples.

Specific interacting motif of apoptin is
responsible for its interaction with BCR-ABL1
In order to identify the precise nature of apoptin
and BCR-ABL1 interaction in CML cells we mapped the
sites on apoptin responsible for interaction with specific
region of BCR-ABL1. The murine bone marrow derived
32DDMSZ, 32Dp210 cells and human CML cell line K562
were transfected with different apoptin mutant constructs
by lipofectamine protocol. Schematic diagrams and the
expression of these mutant derivatives of apoptin tagged
with an N-terminal GFP and expressed in 32DDMSZ cells
are shown in figure 3a and 3b. In the experimental groups
apoptin was immuno-precipitated by murine anti-GFP
antibody from the lysates of transfected cells expressing
various forms of mutant apoptin conjugated with GFP and
the protein complexes were analyzed to detect the presence
of Bcr-Ablp210 by immunoblotting. BCR-ABL1p210 was
found in the immuno-precipitates of full-length apoptin and
apoptin derivatives that harbored aa 74-100 (including the
PRS), implying that this region of apoptin is important for
interaction with BCR-ABL1p210 wt (Fig. 3c). Interestingly,
in this model system the mutants Ala-108 and Glu-108
where the Thr-108 residue of apoptin was replaced by
alanine or glutamine respectively (Ala-108 mutation of
apoptin turns it resistant to phosphorylation and is nontoxic to the cells, whereas the Glu-108 mimicked the
phosphorylated apoptin and retained toxicity) were also
able to interact with BCR-ABL1p210 (Fig. 3c).

Synthetic Apoptin decapeptide inhibits
c-Myc phosphorylation and thus impedes cell
proliferation of BCR-ABL1 expressing cells

Synthetic proline rich sequence of apoptin (aa:
81-90) induces cell death in Bcr-Abl1 expressing
cells and is toxic to imatinib resistant patient
derived primary samples

In our earlier work [19], we showed that apoptin
interacts directly with BCR-ABL1 and inhibits the
phosphorylation of its down stream targets. Here we
tested the effects of Tat-Apoptin, and our apoptindecapeptide on the expression levels of c-Myc and its
active phosphorylated form that enhances cell proliferation
among BCR-ABL1 expressing K562 cell lines. Western
blot image in figure 5a shows that Tat-Apoptin and
Imatinib treated cells showed hampered phosphorylation
of c-Myc compared to control and Tat-GFP treated cells.
Similarly we tested the efficacy of synthetic apoptindecapeptide in inhibiting c-Myc phosphorylation among
K562 cells. As shown in the figure 5b apoptin decapeptide
treated cells showed inhibited phosphorylation of c-Myc
by 36 h similar to Imatinib treated cells at the same time
period compared to control treated and scrambled peptide
treated cells at the respective time interval. A quantified
data of Western blot is shown in figure 5c depicting similar
results.

To study the biological activity of the apoptin
derived cell-penetrating synthetic peptide on murine
32Dp210 cell lines and human K562 cell lines expressing
Bcr-Abl1p210, Tat-conjugated peptide (rkkrrqrrrPKPPSKKRSC) was added at a concentration of
1μM to the growing cells in culture and cell survival
was estimated by MTT cell survival assay at different
time points over a period of 48 hours. The murine IL3dependent primary hematopoietic murine cell line 32DDSMZ
was used as the control cell line. In another set of parallel
experiments a scrambled Tat-conjugated peptide sequence
(rkkrrqrrr-PRRPSRSPKC) was used as treatment control.
The results obtained from these three cell lines (32DDSMZ
32Dp210 and K562) treated with both test and control
peptides are portrayed in figure 4a-c respectively. Cells
grown without any treatment (control) were set to 100%
proliferation and the cell survival was expressed as

DISCUSSION

array that revealed that SH3 regulatory subunit of c-Abl
is a major candidate interacting with recombinant apoptin
(Fig. 2a). The interaction of BCR-ABL1 during apoptin’s
treatment was confirmed by GST-apoptin pull down
assay and apoptin/BCR-ABL1 co-immunoprecipitation
assay in BCR-ABL1 expressing murine (32Dp210) and
human cell line (K562) transfected for the expression
of GFP-Apoptin (Fig. 2b and 2c). The same set of cell
lines was used for immunofluorescence studies to view­
protein-protein interaction directly in the cell. As seen
in the transfected mouse cell systems, the transiently
expressed GFP conjugated apoptin co-transport
cytoplasmic BCR-ABL1 protein pool to the nucleus and
induced apoptotic response [19].
We also observed that apoptin unlike imatinib
was effective both against BCR-ABL1-positive and
BCR-ABL1-negative but transformed cells (Fig. 1c)
as apoptin has multiple and diverse targets within the
cancer/transformed cells as opposed to Imatinib. Thus,
hypothetically apoptin based therapeutics would be not
only more effective, but they would be less prone to the
development of a resistance. So, we further followed this
study to elucidate the minimal region of apoptin that is
capable of interacting with BCR-ABL1. Using various
deletion constructs of apoptin and employing pull down
assays we show that apoptin constructs processing proline
rich region of apoptin ranging from amino acids 81-90
were able to pull down BCR-ABL1 (Fig. 3c). Encouraged
by these results we made synthetic constructs of the
apoptin decapeptide (amino acids 81-90) and showed
that cell permeable Tat-conjugate of this peptide is toxic
among BCR-ABL1 expressing murine 32Dp210 and human
cell line K562 (Fig. 4b and 4c) but not toxic to 32DDSMZ
cells (Fig. 4a). Further, ex vivo cellular toxicity of apoptin
decapeptide among both Imatinib resistant and Imatinib
susceptible CML patient derived samples (Fig. 4 e-f)
and mimicking the full length apoptin in inhibiting the
BCR-ABL1 downstream signaling of c-Myc (Fig 5 a-c)
illustrates the potentiality of the apoptin derived peptide
for further treatment of CML.
Along with our previous study [19] and in this study
we verified the specific interaction domains of apoptin
and BCR-ABL1p210 fusion protein. As demonstrated,
apoptin works by binding to the SH3 domain of BCRABL1 and possibly acting as an adaptor molecule it
prevents the activation of the kinase domain (SH1) [19].
Thus, the ATP binding and phosphorylation of BCRABL1 is downregulated, hence loss of signal leads to
down regulation of cell proliferation and activation of
intrinsic apoptotic pathways. The hypothesis clarifying
the mechanism of apoptin induced down regulation of
activated BCR-ABL1 kinase in CML is summarized in
figure 6b.
In summary, the present study establishes the
minimal region of apoptin interaction domain with
BCR-ABL1 and further shows the anti-cancer effect of

Previously, we showed that Tat-apoptin, a ­cellpenetrating conjugate of apoptin strongly binds to the SH3
domain of BCR-ABL1, modifies the phosphorylation and
thus inhibit the activity of BCR-ABL1 followed with an
attenuation of several of its downstream targets [19]. These
changes lead to the identification of anti-proliferative
effect and induction of intrinsic apoptotic pathways in the
rapidly growing CML cells by apoptin [19]. Using human
CML cells K562 and BCR-ABL1p210 expressing murine
cell line 32Dp210 as a model, which are highly responsive to
apoptin, we further ventured into identifying the smallest
fragment of apoptin that can inhibit BCR-ABL1 activity
and thus mimic the anti-cancer activity of apoptin. In this
study, employing pull-down assays we have successfully
identified BCR-ABL1 interaction domain of apoptin
located between amino acids 81-90. Furthermore, we
show that this apoptin-derived decapeptide’s anti-cancer
activity favorably compares to imatinib. We have further
tested the activity of apoptin decapeptide among CML
cell lines K562 and 32Dp210, and most importantly among
CML-samples derived from Imatinib responsive and
-resistant patients. We show that the apoptin decapeptide is
toxic even for the Imatinib resistant patient samples along
with the responsive samples.
In BCR-ABL1, the fusion of Bcr sequences to the
Abl-SH3 domain abrogates the physiologic regulation of
the tyrosine kinase Abl. This fusion protein is capable of
inducing uncontrolled auto-phosphorylation that activates
the downstream cell growth, proliferation and antiapoptotic pathways. These altered signaling cascades lead
to a series of alterations in the behaviors of CML cells
like diminished adhesion to the stromal environment,
degradation of inhibitory proteins, activation of mitogenic
signaling and inhibition of apoptosis. The human (K562)
and murine cell lines (32Dp210) express BCR-ABL1 and
are thus rapidly growing with a high cytoplasmic BCRABL1p210 pool. Thus the cell culture conditions of these
cell lines resemble blast crisis stage of CML. Furthermore,
as it is in CML, the central mitogenic Ras-MAPK
cascade is also activated in these cell lines. Our findings
corroborate well with previous studies involving a similar
approach directed towards the Grb2-SoS-Ras-MAP kinase
(Erk) pathway [21]. In those experiments Kardinal and
colleagues applied small, high affinity peptides blocking
the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2. Their results indicate
that peptide based inhibitor of BCR-ABL1 kinase or its
down-stream targets could be valuable anti-CML tool
if combined with conventional cytotoxic therapy [21].
Taking a lead from these studies and experimental models
here we studied to derive apoptin based small peptides that
interact and target BCR-ABL1 mediated effects.

BCR-ABL1 an attempt was made to identify the
interaction partners for apoptin by using SH3 specific

the cell-permeable version of apoptin decapeptide (aa
81-90) on the BCR-ABL1 expressing mouse and human
cell lines. The synthetic apoptin decapeptide with a proline
rich region is able to inhibit cell proliferation of both
imatinib-resistant and imatinib sensitive patient samples.
We further show that the apoptin synthetic peptide is
able to inhibit BCR-ABL1 down stream target c-Myc
with a comparable efficacy to full-length apoptin and
Imatinib. Thus, for the first time, we show the therapeutic
potential of apoptin decapeptide for treatment of CML.
Furthermore, the apoptin decapeptide may represent a
solution to three major challenges in the current therapy of
imatinib-resistant CML: (i) inspite the good prognosis for
many CML patients on imatinib, 20-30% of them develop
resistance to imatinib [3, 22] and 7-9% of patients progress
to accelerated phase or blast crisis on imatinib treatment
[7, 8, 23]. Thus, the new apoptin-based targeted therapy
alone or in combination with Imatinib could prevent the
resistance development and progress to accelerated phase
or blast crisis. (ii) The second advantage of new apoptinbased mono or combination therapy could be to obtain a
long-term cure for CML treatment by inducing deeper and
faster molecular and cytogenetic responses and successful
discontinuation of therapy [24] without experiencing an
early molecular relapse. (iii) Finally, 10% of patients
discontinue TKI therapy due to concentration-dependent
and -independent adverse events [25]. The employment
of apoptin decapeptide-based combination therapy may
lower concentration dependent adverse events because one
could diminish the TKI doses.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, plasmids, Cell death and cell proliferation
assays, antibodies and reagents
All cell culture media and supplements were from
Gibco BRL. 32DDSMZ and 32Dp210wt:b3:a2/e13:a (described
as 32Dp210) [26], a BCR-ABL1 variant, were grown
in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 20% FBS
(Hyclone), 100μg/ml penicillin and 0.1 μg/ml streptomycin
(Gibco BRL), 10mM HEPES, 2mM L-Glutamine, 0.13mM
L-Asparagin, 0.05 nM 2-Mercaptoethanol, 1mM NaPyruvate, and non-essential amino acids. 32DDSMZ cells
are strictly murine IL3-dependent, so the media was
supplemented with 10 % media supernatant from WEHI3B cells [26]. The human CML cell line K562 (ATCC® #
CCL-243™) was cultured in ATCC recommended Iscove’s
modified Dulbecco’s medium with 4mM L-glutamine
adjusted to contain 1.5g/L sodium bicarbonate, 10% FCS
(v/v) and antibiotics [27, 28]. All cells were grown at 37°C
with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator and maintained in
a logarithmic growth phase.
The following plasmids were used: GFP, GFPApoptin (apoptin cloned into pEGFP-C1 vector, Clontech),
GST, GST-Apoptin (apoptin cloned into PGEX-2T vector,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Transfection of mammalian cells
Different mammalian primary and cancer
cells were transfected with the desired plasmids by
LipofectamineTM2000 (Invirogen® Canada Inc. Burlington,
Ontario, L7P 1A1) reagent. The cells were plated in an
antibiotic free medium 24 h prior to transfection and
plasmid DNA and transfection reagent were prepared as
per manufacturers recommendations (1:2.5 ratio of DNA
to reagent). Following the incubation, the DNA-lipid
mixture was gently added directly to the cells that had
previously been rinsed with PBS and replaced with fresh
medium.

GST-pull down assay and protein identification,
co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), Western
blotting

described before [33]. Cells were seeded in either 6 well
or 12 well culture plates (Corning Incorporated COSTER).
Tat-fusion proteins were diluted in culture medium to the
desired concentrations (1mM) and added directly to the
cells. Cells were incubated with Tat-fusion proteins at
37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 16h.

The GST and the recombinant GST-apoptin
proteins were purified according to the manufacturer’s
protocol using glutathione sepharose beads (Amersham
Biosciences®). GST-pull down assay was performed to
detect the interacting partners of apoptin. Briefly, either
purified GST or GST-apoptin along with total 32Dp210
or K562 cell lysate were immobilized on glutathione
sepharose beads overnight at 4°C in IP buffer with protease
and phosphatase inhibitors (50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, NaCl
150mM, ND-40 0.5%, EDTA 1mM, PMSF 1mM, NaF
10mM, Na3VO4 1mM, β-glycerophosphate 25mM). Beads
were washed at least six times with ice-cold lyses buffer
and the bound proteins were detected by Western blotting.
For Co-IP experiments, 2-5 μg of antibody was
added to 100-500 μg of cell lysate and incubated (4h
at 4°C) and then 100 μl of equilibrated 50% protein-G
Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech®) were
added to the protein-antibody immune complexes and
incubated (1h at 4°C). Beads were washed (6x) with lyses
buffer and after the final wash, beads were suspended
in SDS sample buffer and resolved on SDS-PAGE gel,
and the immunoprecipitated protein was detected by
Western blotting as previously reported [30-32]. Briefly,
about 30μg protein lysates were resolved by SDS PAGE,
transferred to PVDF-membrane (Amersham Biosciences®)
followed by membrane blocking with 5% non-fat dry milk
powder/tris-buffered saline with 0.25% v/v Tween-20
5% BSA. Membranes were washed and incubated with
an appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for 45min at room temp
and detected by using enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL)
staining (Amersham Biosciences).

Synthesis of short decapeptides
Apoptin derived decapeptide (PKPPSKKRSC) and
scrambled peptide (PKKPSKKRSC) was synthesized
on symphony automated peptide synthesizer (Protein
Technologies Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA) using standard
fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry with
HCTU (ChemPep Inc., Wellington, FL, USA) as the
activating reagent. The synthesis was performed on a
0.05 mmol scale with Fmoc-Cys (Trt)-PEG-PS resin
(Applied Biosystems, Sweden) using a five-fold excess
of amino acid in each coupling. The peptides were
cleaved from the resin by treatment with a mixture of
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and water (95:5 v/v; 10 mL
per gram of polymer) for 1h at room temperature.
After filtration, TFA was evaporated and the peptides
were precipitated by the addition of cold diethyl ether,
centrifuged and lyophilized. The crude products were
purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a semi-preparative
C-18 column (Grace Vydac) and identified from MALDITOF spectra (Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-STR,
Stockholm, Sweden).

Cell death and cell proliferation assays
Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay,
whereas cell death was measured by propidium iodide
uptake. Both assays were performed as previously
described [34, 35].

Immunocytochemistry and fluorescent imaging

Statistical Analysis

Cells were allowed to attach overnight, transfected
with appropriate plasmids and after 16-18h of incubation
cells were collected, washed with PBS, and fixed in 4%
w/v paraformaldehyde /PBS. Thin smear of cells was
prepared on standard microscope glass slides and airdried. Cells were permeabilized (0.1% triton X-100/PBS),
blocked (5% BSA/PBS, 1h) and incubated overnight at
4°C with an appropriate primary antibody, followed
by incubation with Cy3 or FITC conjugated secondary
antibody. Slides were mounted with Vectashield®
containing DAPI. Fluorescence signals were acquired
using Zeiss fluorescent microscope and analyzed by Zeiss
Axiovision 3.1 software.

Unless stated otherwise, all normalized band
intensity data were statistically analyzed by student’s t test
assuming equal variance using Microsoft® Excel software.
The variance patterns in each set of data were previously
checked by ANOVA from Excel data analysis tool package
and Prism (version 6.0b) software. Error bars in all the
graphs represent standard deviation.
