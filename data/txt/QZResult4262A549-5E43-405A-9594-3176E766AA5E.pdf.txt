ABSTRACT
The novel nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) derivative MC3181 is endowed with
remarkable therapeutic activity in mice bearing both sensitive and vemurafenibresistant human melanoma xenografts. Here, we report that subtoxic concentrations
of this compound significantly reduced invasiveness of BRAF-V600D mutated WM115
and WM266.4 melanoma cell lines derived from the primary lesion and related skin
metastasis of the same patient, respectively. The strong antimetastatic activity of
MC3181 was observed in both 2D monolayer cultures and 3D multicellular tumor
spheroids, and confirmed in vivo by the significant decrease in the number of B16-F10
melanoma lung metastases in drug-treated mice. Our data also show that MC3181
affects the lactate production in the high glycolytic WM266.4 cell line. To unveil
the MC3181 mechanism of action, we analyzed the ability of MC3181 to affect the
degree of activation of different MAPK pathways, as well as the expression/activity
levels of several proteins involved in angiogenesis, invasion, and survival (i.e. AP2,
MCAM/MUC18, N-cadherin, VEGF and MMP-2). Our data disclosed both a decrease
of the phospho-active form of JNK and an increased expression of the transcription
factor AP2, events that occur in the very early phase of drug treatment and may be
responsible of the antimetastatic effects of MC3181.

of the basement membrane by neoplastic proliferating
cells, their migration and stroma invasion to enter the
vasculature, and finally their extravasation and adhesion
in distant organs to form a secondary tumor [1–3]. Every
phase of this complex scenario can be rate-limiting and
offers potential target for therapy.

Therapeutically, one of the most recent and
promising approaches is immunotherapy that involves
the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors enabling the
interruption of T-cell pathways responsible for immune
down-regulation or tolerance, such as the anti-CTLA-4
monoclonal antibody (mAb) ipilimumab, along with
the anti-PD-1 mAbs pembrolizumab and nivolumab.
Another important class of drugs is represented by low
molecular weight compounds interfering with signaling
pathways involved in the dysregulation of cell growth
and proliferation; this is the case of vemurafenib and
dabrafenib, which target mutated v-raf murine sarcoma
viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), the selective
inhibitors of extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK), as well as trametinib and cobimetinib targeting
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK Kinase
(MEK) proteins [4]. While these strategies provide a
potential initial clinical benefit, they delay but not prevent
patient mortality due to the ability of tumor to rapidly
acquire resistance to drugs and/or to activate alternative
proliferation pathways.
In contrast with current clinical trials targeting
multiple signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation,
we recently reported that the nitrobenzoxadiazole
derivatives (NBDs) NBDHEX [6-((7-nitrobenzo[c]
[1,2,5]oxadiazol-4-yl)thio)hexan-1-ol] and its more watersoluble analogue, MC3181 [2-(2-(2-((7-nitrobenzo[c]
[1,2,5]oxadiazol-4-yl)thio)ethoxy)ethoxy)ethanol], exert
a potent antitumor activity through the activation of
different MAPK pathways. These compounds represent a
new class of antitumor agents exhibiting an outstanding
therapeutic activity together with an extremely non-toxic
profile in human cutaneous melanoma mouse xenografts.
NBDHEX and MC3181 inhibit glutathione transferase
P1-1 (GSTP1-1), and disrupt the GSTP1-1/JNK1 and
GSTP1-1/TRAF2 complexes, thereby causing prolonged
tumor cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Therefore, these
drugs may constitute a new effective strategy for the
treatment of BRAF-mutated human melanomas, capable
of overcoming the resistance to vemurafenib [5, 6].
On this ground, we were prompted to test the
antimetastatic properties of the more soluble NBD
derivative, MC3181, against melanoma cells lines derived
from the primary lesion (WM115) and a skin metastasis
(WM266.4) of a single patient harboring a BRAF-V600D
mutation.
Our data revealed that subcytotoxic doses of
MC3181 exert a strong antimetastatic activity in vitro.
To understand the mechanism(s) underling this effect, we
measured the expression/activity levels of key proteins
involved in melanoma cells migration and invasion,
and focused on signaling pathways that modulate these
proteins. Moreover, using the B16-F10 melanoma mouse
model of metastasis, we demonstrated that the oral
administration of MC3181 exerts a potent antimetastatic
effect, significantly suppressing and/or delaying lung
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

metastasis in the absence of detectable sign of toxicity.
These data provide evidence to further support the
potential of MC3181 as a novel therapeutic to treat
metastatic melanoma.

RESULTS
Antiproliferative activity of MC3181 and
NBDHEX on WM115 and WM266.4 2D
monolayer cultures and 3D multicellular tumor
spheroids
The antitumor efficacy of MC3181 was tested in
vitro on 2D WM115 and WM266.4 human melanoma cell
cultures, and compared with NBDHEX, temozolomide
(TMZ) and vemurafenib (VMF). The concentration–
response profiles (Supplementary Figure 1) fulfill the
IC50 values reported in Table 1. Of note, the IC50 values
calculated for MC3181 are in the low micromolar range
(1.0–1.3 μM), and close to those obtained for both
NBDHEX and vemurafenib (VMF), whereas TMZ is at
least 600 times less effective.
Next, we decided to evaluate the effect of MC3181
and its parent drug, NBDHEX, on 3D multicellular
tumor spheroids, which are more precise in mimicking
the complex organization of tumor tissue in vivo [7].
Spheroids were treated with graded concentrations of
MC3181 (Figure 1b and 1d) or NBDHEX (Figure 1c and
1e), and IC50 values were obtained by analyzing both cell
viability (MTS) and growth rate. A schematic diagram
for treatment schedule and analysis (cell imaging and
viability assay) is shown in Figure 1a. We noticed that
WM266.4 spheroids grew faster increasing their volume
25 times at the end of the experiment (day 17, Figure 1d
and 1e), whilst the WM115 counterparts augmented only
8 times (Figure 1b and 1c). The IC50 values of MC3181
on WM266.4 spheroids were in the low micromolar range
(0.5–7.7 μM, Table 2), comparable at both 48 hours and
17 days, and similar to those obtained with NBDHEX.
In contrast, 48 hours treatment with both MC3181 and
NBDHEX caused flaking of WM115 spheroids and
formation of poorly defined contours that did not allow
an accurate measurement of spheroids’ diameter (data
not shown). Additionally, after 17 days of treatment, the
spheroids’ viability dropped more slowly compared to the
spheroids’ volume, resulting in loss of linear relationship
between viability and cell number (Table 2). A similar
event has been already reported and explained by the
occurrence of cell cycle arrest [8].

Effect of low concentrations of MC3181 on cell
proliferation and cell cycle
Since MC3181 and NBDHEX showed comparable
activity in both WM115 and WM266.4 cells, we focused
on the antimetastatic efficacy of the more water soluble

NBD derivative, namely MC3181. We investigated
three different concentrations of MC3181 for each cell
line: WM115 and WM266.4 cells were treated with
MC3181 concentrations of 1.3 and 1.0 μM respectively
(corresponding to their IC50 values), 0.26 and 0.20 μM
respectively (corresponding to 1/5 of their IC50 values) and
0.05 and 0.04 μM respectively (corresponding to 1/25 of
their IC50 values).
We analyzed cell proliferation and cell cycle at
different time points after the addition of MC3181. A
decrease in the WM115 growth rate was observed after
24 hours incubation with both 0.26 and 1.3 μM MC3181
(Supplementary Figure 2a), which corresponds to a
significant arrest in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle
(Supplementary Figure 2b). In contrast, WM266.4
showed only a slight decrease of cell proliferation after 48
hours treatment with the highest MC3181 dose (1.0 μM)
(Supplementary Figure 2c). In accordance, the WM266.4
cell cycle was only slightly affected by treatment with 1.0
μM MC3181 (Supplementary Figure 2d).

MC3181 was sufficient to induce 40% reduction of cell
adhesion to collagen (Figure 2d), but a significant effect
(80% inhibition) on gelatin adhesion was evident only
with 1.0 μM MC3181 (Figure 2e). Finally, MC3181 did
not show any significant inhibitory effect on tumor cell
adhesion to Matrigel (Figure 2f).

MC3181 inhibits invasion of human melanoma
cells in vitro
Another aspect of tumor progression is the ability
of tumor cells to invade basement membranes and
connective tissue leading to the possible formation of
distant metastases. We investigated the migratory and
invasive potential of both primary tumor (WM115) and
metastasis-derived (WM266.4) melanoma cells after 48
hours treatment with MC3181. This compound efficiently
suppressed invasion in both cell lines, without any effect
on their migration (Figure 3a, 3b, 3f and 3g). Of note, a
concentration of MC3181 corresponding to 1/25 of its IC50
value (0.04 μM) was capable of inducing 75% reduction of
WM266.4 invasion index (Figure 3h), while an equiactive
concentration of MC3181 (0.05 μM) reduced the invasion
index of WM115 by approximately 30% (Figure 3c).
However, 60% inhibition of WM115 invasion index was
obtained with 0.26 and 1.3 μM. Further, we evaluated
the antimetastatic properties of MC3181 in a third tumor
cell line, namely the BRAF-V600E-mutated SK-MEL-5
human melanoma cell line, which has been established
from an axillary lymph node metastasis. Based on the
finding that in the SRB assay MC3181 exhibited an IC50
value of 1.6 ± 0.1 μM towards SK-MEL-5 cells (data not
shown), invasion/migration assays were carried out using
the following drug concentrations: 1.60 μM (i.e., the IC50);
0.32 μM (i.e., 1/5 of IC50); and 0.06 μM (i.e., 1/25 of the
IC50) (Supplementary Figure 3). The invasive potential
of SK-MEL-5 cells was reduced by approximately 30%
by 0.32 μM MC3181 whereas, a 60% inhibition was
recorded at a drug concentration of 1.6 μM. Furthermore,
MC3181 significantly depressed migration of SK-MEL-5
cells (Supplementary Figure 3a and 3b). Of note, a 50%
reduction of cell migration was achieved with 0.32 and 1.6
μM MC3181. Since the drug inhibited both SK-MEL-5
cell invasion and migration, no change of the invasion
index occurred (Supplementary Figure 3c).

MC3181 treatment affects the adhesion
properties of both WM115 and WM266.4 cells
The successful dissemination of tumor cells and the
formation of new tumor foci require cancer cells adhesion
and detachment from components of the extracellular
matrix (ECM) and basement membrane (BM). Therefore,
we analyzed the effect of MC3181 on the adhesion
properties of WM115 and WM266.4 cells to different
ECM components, i.e. type I collagen, Matrigel and
gelatin [9, 10].
The primary tumor-derived WM115 cells showed
poor basal adhesion on both gelatin and Matrigel
(Figure 2b and 2c). The treatment with 0.26-1.3 μM
MC3181 reduced to approximately 50% their adhesion
to collagen (Figure 2a), whilst a concentration-dependent
effect was observed on gelatin (Figure 2b), reaching an
adhesion inhibition of 84% at 1.3 μM MC3181. This drug
concentration was also able to abolish (96%) the adhesion
of WM115 on Matrigel (Figure 2c).
The skin metastasis-derived WM266.4 cells showed
excellent adhesion properties on all the substrates tested
(Figure 2d-2f). However, the sensitivity to MC3181
was clearly lower than that of WM115. Indeed, 0.04 μM

MC3181 treatment reduces MMP-2 intracellular
activity

decrease in the number of cells with active invadopodia
following treatment with concentrations of MC3181
corresponding to 1/5 and 1/25 of its IC50 value in these cell
lines (Figure 4c and 4f). Moreover, the highest MC3181
concentrations (i.e., 1.3 and 1.0 μM for WM115 and
WM266.4, respectively) completely inhibited adhesion
of the cells to the fluorescein-gelatin layer. Under these
conditions, it was not possible to estimate the percentage
of cells with active invadopodia.

We next examined MMP-2 activity in WM115 and
WM266.4 melanoma cells by gelatin zymography (Figure
3d, 3e, 3i and 3l). Densitometric analysis showed that
treatment of both cell lines with equiactive concentrations
of MC3181 induced a reduction of the MMP-2 activity
in a concentration-dependent manner. In particular, a
significant inhibition of MMP-2 proteolytic activity was
observed in WM115 and WM266.4 cells treated with a
concentration of MC3181 corresponding to the IC50 value
in these cell lines (i.e., 1.3 and 1.0 μM, respectively)
(Figure 3e and 3l).

Effects of MC3181 treatment on intracellular
metabolome of WM115 and WM266.4 melanoma
cells
A comprehensive analysis of the effects of
intracellular metabolome was carried out by quantitative
1
H-NMR spectroscopy on WM115 and WM266.4 cells
following MC3181 treatment for 48 hours.
As shown in Supplementary Figure 4, we found a
progressive decrease in the intracellular levels of lactate
in the high glycolytic WM266.4 cells, while we did not
found other metabolic changes in the same cells (see
Supplementary Tables 1A and 1B). No evident effects on
metabolome were found in WM115 cells treated at both
low and high concentrations of MC3181.

MC3181 affects invadopodia formation in
WM115 and WM266.4 melanoma cell lines
The strong effect of MC3181 prompted us to
investigate the possible effect of the drug on the formation
of invadopodia, protrusions emanating from the surface
of cells and characterized by a high proteolitic activity
towards the ECM. We examined the ability of WM115
and WM266.4 cells to degrade fluorescein-gelatin by
observing the loss of fluorescence of the labeled gelatin
and its correspondence with phalloidin structure, which
identifies invadopodia puncta (Figure 4a and 4d). In
addition, the presence of invadopodia was confirmed
by measuring the fluorescence intensity of TRITCphalloidin (red line) and fluorescein-gelatin (green line)
along an arbitrary line that crossed through neighboring
invadopodia structures. Figures 4b for WM115 and
4e for WM266.4 show a drastic decrease of the green
fluorescence intensity in correspondence with an increase
in the red fluorescence intensity of TRITC-phalloidin.

shown in Figure 5a, and a representative gel is reported

WM115 cells, while they drastically decreased at 48
hours after treatment with all the MC3181 concentrations
tested (Figure 5a, left). Interestingly, 9 hours of drug
exposure were sufficient to induce a drastic decrease
of the CDH2 mRNA (Figure 5a, left). Conversely, a
strong reduction of mRNA expression of all genes
could be observed in WM266.4 cells after 48 hours of

MC3181 (Figure 5a, right). We did not detect the presence
of CDH1 mRNA in both WM115 and WM266.4 cell lines,

Finally, we decided to perform a preliminary

able to invade the collagen matrix, and therefore subsequent
experiments were performed only on WM266.4 cells. Also
in this case, the compound was able to significantly reduce
cells invasion into collagen, in a dose dependent manner
(Figure 6). Twenty-four hour treatment with 0.04, 0.20 and
1.0 μM MC3181 reduced the distance invaded by WM266.4
cells by about 40, 60 and 80%, respectively, compared
to the control. The effect obtained with 0.20 and 1.0 μM
MC3181 remained constant over the 48 hours incubation

JNK, ERK and p38. We found that MC3181 was able
to induce a significant reduction of P-JNK levels in the
metastasis-derived melanoma cell line, starting within
30 minutes after addition of the drug (Figure 7a). This
reduction persisted for 48 hours in the presence of 1 μM
MC3181. Of note, when WM266.4 cells were treated
with higher MC3181 concentrations (i.e. 2.0 and 4.0 μM)
we observed a persistent JNK activation that paralleled
an increase of apoptotic cells, as previously reported
(Supplementary Figure 6) [5, 6]. Phospho-activation of
p38 was also significantly affected by 1.0 μM MC3181
up to 48 hours (P-p38, Figure 7c). As regards ERK
activation, the levels of P-ERK in drug treated cells were
not significantly different from those of control cells, at all
of the investigated MC3181 concentrations (Figure 7b).

MC3181 treatment reduced by more than 30% the number
of metastatic lung nodules, as compared to untreated mice
(Figure 8), thus supporting the concept that the drug may
be particularly active in preventing melanoma invasion
and metastasis.

DISCUSSION
The ability of cancer cells to migrate, invade, and
metastasize to other organs represents the most lethal
aspect of melanoma, as well as the major hurdle to
successful therapeutic intervention.
In the present study, we demonstrated that subtoxic
concentrations of MC3181 are effective in reducing
the invasiveness of both two BRAF-V600D-mutated
melanoma cell lines (namely, WM115 and WM266.4) as
well as of the BRAF-V600E-mutated human melanoma
cell line SK-MEL-5.
We previously reported [6] the high antiproliferative
activity of MC3181 against a wide panel of melanoma
cells in vitro. Here, we confirmed this potent and
concentration-dependent ability in both 2D monolayer
and 3D multicellular spheroids cultures. Moreover,
since cell adhesion is a fundamental step involved in
the physiological processes of proliferation, invasion,
as well as the pathology of neoplastic transformation
and metastasis, we were prompted to investigate the
capacity of MC3181 to hinder this phenomenon in both
2D and 3D-cultures. The drug successfully affected
the adhesion properties of cell cultures, and interfered
also with invadopodia formation. Moreover, MC3181
caused a concentration-dependent decrease of lactate
levels in the high glycolytic WM266.4 cells. MC3181
acted selectively to inhibit lactate formation without
affecting intracellular metabolites involved in glucose,
phospholipid and energetic metabolism of this cell line.
Indeed, an increase in intracellular lactate (Warburg
metabolic phenotype) causes a consistent acidification
of the tumor microenvironment triggering epithelial–
mesenchymal transition (EMT) in melanoma cells and
promoting invasion and metastasis through expression,
activation and secretion of proteolytic enzymes [13].
Consequently, the ability of MC3181 to counteract the
formation of an acidic microenvironment may represent a
crucial step in the suppression of metastatic phenotype of
WM266.4 cells. Overall, these data are paralleled by the
in vivo antimetastatic activity observed against the highly
metastatic B16-F10 murine melanoma cells.
To gain insight into the mechanisms of action
underlying these results, we investigated the effects of
MC3181 on the expression of genes involved in melanoma
progression and metastatization, at both mRNA and
protein levels. In particular, we focused our analysis
on the transcription factor AP2, known to regulate the
developmental choice between growth and differentiation
in several embryonic tissues, and whose expression

Autophagy is not involved in the anti-metastatic
effect of MC3181
As autophagy seems to be involved in tumor cell
motility and invasion [12], we investigated the impact
of subtoxic concentrations of MC3181 on the basal
autophagy of WM266.4 cells. Western blot analysis
showed that a 48-hours treatment with low concentrations
of MC3181 did not significantly affect the levels of the
autophagosome-associated LC3-II protein (Supplementary
Figure 7). Thus, the anti-metastatic activity of MC3181 is
not attributable to autophagy modulation.

MC3181 reduces the expression of proteins
involved in tumor invasion and angiogenesis
and increases the level of the AP2 transcription
factor
Then, we checked the expression levels of
several proteins involved in the extravasation process.
Treatment of WM266.4 cells with 1.0 μM MC3181
caused a sustained increase of the transcription factor
AP2 (activating enhancer binding protein 2), starting
within 30 minutes after addition of the drug (Figure
7d and 7e). Furthermore, 1.0 μM MC3181 caused a
significant and sustained decrease in the expression of the
adhesion molecules MCAM/MUC18 (CD146), VEGF
and N-cadherin (Figure 7d, 7f, 7g and 7h). Of note, the
expression of the latter protein was significantly affected
also by lower concentrations of MC3181.

MC3181 oral administration reduces melanomainduced lung metastases
To assess the potential antimetastatic effect of
MC3181 in vivo, B6 mice were injected i.v. with syngeneic
melanoma cells at day 0, and treated 8 hours later, and
subsequently on a daily base, with an oral administration
of the drug. Two weeks after tumor cell injection, animals
were sacrificed, lungs explanted and metastases counted.

levels inversely correlate with melanoma progression in
human primary melanoma specimens [14–21]. Of note,
MC3181 caused an early increase in the expression levels
of AP2 in the metastatic cell line, together with a decrease
of N-cadherin, MCAM/MUC18 and VEGF. In fact,
this transcription factor acts as a tumor suppressor, and
its loss results in the up-regulation of the expression of
several genes involved in the acquisition of the metastatic
phenotype [16, 22–24].
In particular, N-cadherin favors the interaction
of melanoma cells with other cell types expressing
N-cadherin, such as fibroblasts or vascular endothelial
cells [25, 26], thus fostering the access of tumor cells
to the vasculature and the formation of metastases [27].
This process is also promoted by the proteolytic activity
of matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2, which degrades
collagen IV [28], a major constituent of ECM, and favors
melanoma cells to cross the basal lamina and migrate
to their secondary sites of growth. Indeed, we showed
here that MC3181 also induced a significant reduction
of MMP-2 activity. These data are also supported by the
evidence that MC3181 treatment decreases the number of
cells with active invadopodia. Thus, MC3181 treatment
appears to force melanoma towards a less aggressive
phenotype lowering the expression of several proteins
involved in invasion and angiogenesis.

We previously reported that cytotoxic amounts
of NBDHEX and MC3181 can disrupt the interaction
between GSTP1-1 and TRAF2, leading to a prolonged
activation of different MAPK pathways and eventually
cell death [6, 29]. This is in contrast with the fact that
activation of MAPKs is involved in the control of cell
migration and invasion by regulating the expression and
activation of MMPs [30]; in particular, the activating
mutations in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK proteins result in
constitutive signaling that promote the oncogenic behavior
of melanomas. Moreover, the MAP kinase JNK plays a
role in the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype, acting
at multiple levels. JNK interacts with and phosphorylates
paxillin leading to an increased formation of invadopodia
in gliomas [31], and JNK inhibition in melanoma by
α-solanine significantly reduces cell migration and
invasion [32]. Surprisingly, we found that subtoxic
amounts of MC3181 not only did not activate ERK
but also caused a significant and sustained decrease of
the phospho-active forms of JNK and p38. This event
occurred in the very early phase of drug treatment, and
paralleled the increase in the AP2 expression. Nonetheless,
the potential involvement of alternative MC3181 targets
cannot be ruled out. However, when the amount of
MC3181 was increased to concentrations higher than its
IC50 value, we confirmed the previously reported evidence

Figure 8: Antimetastatic effect of MC3181 in vivo. On day 0, C57BL/6 mice were injected i.v. with 1×105 Syngeneic B16-F10

PBS. Control group received PBS only. Mice were sacrificed on day 14, and lung metastatic nodules counted with the aid of a dissecting
microscope. P = 0.001.

of a persistent phospho-activation of JNK driving cell
death.
The molecular alterations reported above may also
explain the effect of MC3181 treatment on the amount of
lactate present in the metastatic WM266.4 cancer cells.
Gao et al. [33] found higher nuclear levels of pyruvate
kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) in WM266.4 cells, as
compared to those recorded in the parent WM115 cells.
Nuclear PKM2 could act as a coactivator of β-catenin to
induce the expression of c-Myc, which in turn promotes
the expression of glycolytic genes. In particular, c-Myc
transcriptionally induces the expression of both glucose
transporter 1 and lactate dehydrogenase A, which are
required for glucose uptake and conversion of pyruvate
to lactate, respectively [34]. c-Myc transcription is also
regulated by the JNK/AP1 pathway [35], and the inhibition
of this pathway causes a decrease in the lactate production
[36]. Furthermore, the transcription factor AP-2 directly
interacts with c-Myc and inhibits its binding to DNA [37].
Therefore, we may hypothesize that both inhibition of
JNK phospho-activation and increment of AP2 levels may
be responsible for the decrease of lactate production in
WM266.4 cells upon treatment with MC3181.
Overall, the results of the present study are
particularly relevant considering the high unmet need for
more effective and safer systemic therapies for metastatic
melanoma.

supplemented with the above-mentioned reagents and 50
mM β-mercaptoethanol. All cell lines were maintained at
37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.
For in vitro antiproliferative studies, WM115
(2.5×104 cells/cm2), WM266.4 cells (1.25×104 cells/cm2)
and SK-MEL-5 (2.5×104 cells/cm2) were seeded in 96well plates and the IC50 values for each compound was
then evaluated by the SRB assay as previously reported
[5, 6].
The effects of MC3181 on cell growth and cell
cycle were evaluated in WM115 and WM266.4 cell lines
(2.5×104 and 1.25×104 cells/cm2, respectively) seeded in
75 cm2 flask (Corning B.V. Life Sciences, Amsterdam,
Netherlands). Forty-eight hours after plating, cells were
exposed to equiactive concentrations of MC3181 (0.05,
0.26 and 1.3 μM for WM115, and 0.04, 0.20 and 1.0 μM
for WM266.4), harvested at different time points, counted
using a Neubauer Chamber (after 1:1 dilution in Trypan
Blue), and analyzed by a FACSCalibur instrument (BD
Bioscence, San Jose, CA, USA). Flow cytometric data
were analyzed by FlowJo 8.8.6 software (Tree Stare, Inc,

Cell adhesion assay
A 48-well plate was coated with 200 μL of collagen
(7.5 μg/ml), gelatin (0.1%), or Matrigel (0.2 mg/ml),
and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature (RT).
After PBS washes, plates were blocked by incubation
for 30 minutes at 37°C in cell culture medium. Human
melanoma cells (5×104 cell/well) were suspended in
complete medium in the absence or presence of graded
concentrations of MC3181, then plated onto the pre-coated
wells, and allowed to adhere to the different substrates for
30 minutes at 37°C. Non-adhering cells were washed off
with PBS, and the adhering cells were fixed with cold
methanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and stained with 0.5% crystal
violet. Digital photos of 3 random fields were taken at
magnification 20X (3X digital camera) with an inverted
microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE TS100). After imaging, the
absorbance of the solubilized dye (in 100% methanol)
was measured at 580 nm. The data are expressed as the
mean percentages ± SD from at least three independent
experiments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

NBDHEX and MC3181 were synthesized as
previously reported [6, 38]. For in vitro studies, NBDHEX,
MC3181, temozolomide (TMZ; Sigma-Aldrich, Milan,
Italy) and vemurafenib (VMF; Selleckem, Munich,
Germany) were dissolved in DMSO. Before use, each
compound was diluted to the appropriate concentration in
complete culture medium; the final DMSO concentration
never exceeded 0.05% (v/v). For in vivo studies, MC3181
was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).

RNA isolation and reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

WM115 and WM266.4 cells (2.0×104/cm2) were
seeded on 8-well chamber slides previously coated with
Fluorescein-Gelatin following manufacturer’s protocol
(QCMTM Gelatin Invadopodia Assay Green, Millipore).
After 5 hours incubation in absence and in presence of
graded MC3181 concentrations (0.05, 0.26 and 1.3 μM
for WM115, 0.04, 0.20 and 1.0 μM for WM266.4), cells
were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, washed in PBS,
permeabilized by fluorescent staining buffer (2% blocking
serum and 0.25% Triton X-100 in DPBS without Ca2+ and
Mg2+), and then stained for TRITC-Phalloidin and DAPI
following manufacturer’s instruction. Fluorescence was
detected using a Fluoview 1000 Olympus (Opera Zerbo,
Milan, Italy) system equipped with an Olympus IX-81
inverted microscope. Acquisitions were performed with a
40X magnification oil immersion objective (NA 1.42, WD
0.15 mm). Cells with active invadopodia were defined as
cells characterized by dot like structures. The Z-optical
section series, obtained beginning from the nuclear apex
and progressing down in 0.48 μM (at least 22 planes),
were converted to maximum projection images to avoid
subjectivity in the choice of the plane to be analysed.
Gelatin degradation was visualized as darker areas on the
coverslip due to proteolytic removal of the FluoresceinGelatin. Almost 100-150 cells/sample were analysed in
merged images by the ImageJ software.

WM115 and WM266.4 cells were plated in
75cm2 flask (2.5×104 cells/cm2 and 1.25×104 cells/cm2,
respectively). Forty-eight hours after seeding, cells were
incubated with increasing concentrations of MC3181
for 9, 24, and 48 hours. Two human melanoma cell lines
(M10 and M14) were used as positive control, while
the negative counterpart is represented by the EhlersDanlos syndrome (EDS) derived fibroblast cell line.
Both control and WM115 and WM266.4 samples were
detached by trypsinization, washed twice with PBS,
centrifuged for 15 minutes at 1200 x g (4°C), and then
frozen at -70°C in a Guanidine-Iso-Thiocyanate solution
(2x106 cells/sample). RNA extraction was performed as
described by Chomczyńsky and Sacchi [41], with slight
modifications, and resuspended in distilled sterile water.
RNA purity and concentration were determined both
spectrophotometrically and electrophoretically.
For qualitative RT-PCR analysis, we designed
an expression panel including different pro-angiogenic
factors, cell-cell adhesion molecules, and matrix-metallo
proteinases. Of note, we analyzed two out of the 6 possible
transcripts of the melanoma adhesion molecule MCAM/
MUC 18 gene: the short isoform, widely expressed by
endothelial cells, and the long isoform, more melanomaspecific [11, 42–44]. Two micrograms of total RNA and
2.5 units of Moloney Murine Leukemia virus reverse
transcriptase [45] (Applied BioSystems, Roche Molecular
Systems, Inc., Branchburh, New Jersey, USA) were applied
in all RT-PCR experiment, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. For the generation of the first strand cDNA,
the reaction mix contained 2.5 μM oligo d(T)16, 5 mM
MgCl2, 1 μM dNTPs, 1 unit of RNase Inhibitor (Applied
BioSystems) during 1 h incubation at 42°C. A 2μl aliquot
of cDNA was used for single step PCR for all genes, with
the exception of MCAM/MUC 18 that included subsequent
nested PCR. Primer sequences and PCR conditions
are reported in detail in Supplementary Information.
The resulting nested products (25 μl) were analyzed
on a 1.8% agarose gel. RNA integrity was checked

High-resolution 1H-NMR analyses of cell extracts
WM115 (2.5×104 cells/cm2) and WM266.4 cells
(1.25×104 cells/cm2) were plated in 150 cm2 flasks and, 48
hours after seeding, were treated with equiactive MC3181
concentrations (0.26 and 1.3 μM for WM115, 0.20 and
1.0 μM for WM266.4). Cells were trypsinized 48 hours
after treatment, counted, and assessed for viability and
membrane integrity by trypan blue staining. Following
washes with ice-cold PBS, cell pellets were resuspended
in 0.5 ml of ice-cold twice-distilled water. Aqueous

(37°C; 5% CO2), cells adherent to the underside of the
filters were fixed and permeabilized with 70% ethanol,

the following equations:

Generation and analysis of 3D multicellular
tumor spheroids
Spheroids were generated through the liquidoverlay technique. Briefly, 100 μl/well of cell suspension
at optimized densities (0.5×104 cells/ml for WM115 and
0.5×103 for WM266.4), were dispensed onto 96-well flatbottomed plates (Corning B.V. Life Sciences), pre-coated
with 1.5% agarose (wt/vol, Serva ELECTROPHORESIS)
and incubated 4 days at 37°C, in a 5% CO2 humidified
atmosphere. Spheroids treatment was performed by
adding MC3181 and NBDHEX at a final concentration
ranging from 0.005 to 50 μM (final incubation volume,
200 μl). Fifty percent of the medium in each well was
replenished 48 hours after treatment and at day, 4, 6, 10
and 14. Spheroid size was measured up to 17 days by
phase contrast imaging (10X magnification, 3X digital
magnification) using a Nikon ECLIPSE TS100 inverted

GRANT SUPPORT

Procedures involving animals and their care were
in conformity with Institutional Guidelines (D.L. 116/92
and subsequent implementing circulars), and experimental
protocols were approved by the local Ethical Committee of
Padova University (CEASA). During in vivo experiments,
animals in all experimental groups were examined
daily for a decrease in physical activity and other signs
of disease or drug toxicity; severely ill animals were
euthanized by carbon dioxide overdose.
Six to eight week-old male C57BL/6 (B6) inbred
mice (H-2b) were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories (Calco, Italy), and housed in our Specific
Pathogen Free (SPF) animal facility. B16-F10 cells were
suspended in PBS and checked for viability using trypan
blue staining. Only when cell viability was > 90% the cell
batch was considered for injection. B16-F10 cells (1×105)
were injected intravenously into syngeneic C57BL/6J
mice, which were then divided randomly into 2 groups
(6 mice/group). Eight hours later, MC3181 was dissolved
in PBS and administered orally according to a q1dx6
schedule for 2 weeks at a dose of 8 mg/kg/day. Control
group received PBS. Mice were then sacrificed after two
weeks of treatment, lungs were harvested, rinsed in water,
and fixed in Bouin’s solution. Surface metastases were
then counted with the aid of a dissecting microscope.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses have been performed using the
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Windows,
version 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Descriptive
statistics consisted of the mean ± SD for parameters
with gaussian distributions (Kolgomorov-Smirnov test).
The equality of the variances was confirmed by the
Levene's Test. ANOVA one-way followed by Dunnett's
test was used for multiple comparison among treatment
groups (>2) and control. A P value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
