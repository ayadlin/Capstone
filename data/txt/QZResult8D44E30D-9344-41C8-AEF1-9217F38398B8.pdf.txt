Genetic Polymorphisms of
CYP2D6*10 and
CYP2C19*2, *3 Are Not
Associated With Prognosis,
Endometrial Thickness, or
Bone Mineral Density in
Japanese Breast Cancer
Patients Treated With
Adjuvant Tamoxifen
The study by Okishiro et al1 concludes that the cytochrome P450 (CYP) genotype CYP2D6*10/*10 is
unlikely to have a clinically significant impact on prognosis in women with breast cancer who receive adjuvant tamoxifen.
However, several aspects of the study by Okishiro
et al call their conclusions into question and raise serious doubts whether a statistical review was performed
as part of the peer-review process.
First, questions exist regarding the makeup of the
authors’ cohort, including the number of patients who
either refused consent or did not undergo blood collection. Furthermore, because the timing of blood collection is not specified, there would be great opportunity
for bias if patients were identified and blood collection
was initiated months or years after surgery, in that the
patients who developed recurrent disease and/or died
would not have been included. The authors did not
provide the rationale for including patients who had
estrogen receptor-negative disease (for which tamoxifen
is not effective) or patients who also received chemotherapy (which reduces the likelihood of a breast event
and, thus, the statistical power). The consistency of the
surveillance schedule and the documentation needed to
verify disease progression were not addressed. Finally,
the number of patients who could not be located, the
number of disease progressions, and the number deaths
without progression were not provided.
Despite these issues, the most disconcerting aspect of this report is that the authors were not required
to provide the smallest detectable hazard ratio given

their study characteristics. Compared with CYP2D6
extensive metabolizers, poor metabolizers exhibit a 3fold higher risk of recurrence,2,3 whereas CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers (those with ‘‘intermediate’’
reductions in endoxifen concentrations) exhibit a lower
risk of recurrence.2-5 Given the characteristics of the
study by Okishiro et al (median follow-up, 56 months
among 173 patients, with 25% with the *10/*10 genotype; enrollment period, 6 years; follow-up, 4 years;
and 5-year recurrence-free survival rate, 90% in the
*10/*10 genotype subgroup), a 2-sided a ¼ .05 logrank test has a power of 26% to detect a 2-fold increase
in the hazard of disease recurrence in the *10/*10 carriers relative to *10/wild type (wt) or wt/wt carriers.
The relation between the CYP2D6*10 genotype
and recurrence in tamoxifen-treated patients is an important question that the study by Okishiro et al is neither designed nor statistically powered to answer.
