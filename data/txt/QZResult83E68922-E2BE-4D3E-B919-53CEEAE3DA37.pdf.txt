Synergistic Chemosensitivity of Triple-Negative Breast
Cancer Cell Lines to Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase
Inhibition, Gemcitabine, and Cisplatin
Kedar Hastak, Elizabeth Alli, and James M. Ford

Abstract
The basal-like subtype of breast cancer is characterized by a triple-negative (TN) phenotype (estrogen
receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2/neu negative). TN breast cancers share similar gene expression profiles and DNA repair deficiencies with BRCA1-associated breast cancers.
BRCA1-mutant cells exhibit sensitivity to gemcitabine, cisplatin, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
inhibition; therefore, we hypothesized that TN cancer cells may also exhibit sensitivity to these drugs. In this
study, we report that TN breast cancer cells are more sensitive to these drugs compared with non-TN breast
cancer cells. Moreover, combination treatments indicated that PARP inhibition by the small-molecule inhibitor PJ34 or siRNA knockdown synergized with gemcitabine and cisplatin in TN cells but not in luminal cancer
cells. TN cells exhibited reduced repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers after PARP inhibition,
suggesting that the synergistic effect of PJ34 and gemcitabine or cisplatin reflected inefficient nucleotide
excision repair. Mechanistic investigations revealed that in TN cells, PJ34 reduced the levels of ΔNp63α with
a concurrent increase in p73 and its downstream target p21. Thus, the sensitivity to combination treatment
seemed to be mediated by sustained DNA damage and inefficient DNA repair triggering p63/p73–mediated
apoptosis. Our results suggest a novel therapeutic strategy to treat women with TN breast cancer, an aggressive disease that presently lacks effective treatment options. Cancer Res; 70(20); 7970–80. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cause of malignancy
and the second most common cause of cancer death in
women (1). This heterogeneous disease is composed of five
major biological subtypes, which are based on microarray
gene classifications: luminal A, luminal B, normal breast-like,
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and
basal-like breast cancers (1, 2). Whereas many of these subtypes can be treated with much success, the basal-like carcinomas are associated with high rates of relapse following
chemotherapy (3, 4). Basal-like breast tumors are largely
estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and
HER2/neu negative [triple negative (TN)] and express genes
characteristic of basal epithelial and normal breast myoepithelial cells (5–7). However, the genes responsible for the
etiology and aggressive phenotype of basal-like breast cancers remain unknown.

As many cancer chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation
therapy cause DNA damage, tumor cells defective in DNA
repair pathways are predicted to be sensitive to their effects.
Indeed, cell lines deficient in BRCA1 (and BRCA2) have been
shown to be sensitive to the DNA cross-linking agents cisplatin and mitomycin C (8, 9), the topoisomerase inhibitor
etoposide (10), and oxidative DNA damage (11). Recently,
we have shown that BRCA1-deficient cells are sensitive
to gemcitabine (2′,2′-difluoro-2′-deoxycytidine; ref. 12), an
analogue of cytosine arabinoside that exhibits anticancer
properties due to potent inhibition of DNA synthesis (13).
Gemcitabine is often used either alone or in combination
with other drugs such as taxanes, vinorelbine, carboplatin,
or trastuzumab in metastatic breast cancer. However, there
are no reports of the efficacy of gemcitabine in the basal-like
subtype of breast cancers.
The BRCA1 breast cancer susceptibility gene is known to be
involved in a number of DNA repair pathways, including DNA
double-strand break repair through homologous recombination (HR; ref. 14), nucleotide excision repair (NER; ref. 15), and
base excision repair (BER) of oxidative DNA damage (11).
Recently, BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells have also been
shown to be sensitive to inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; refs. 16, 17), an enzyme involved in BER, which,
when inhibited, leads to DNA strand breaks and cell death. In
this scenario, BRCA-mutant tumor cells with primary defects
in DNA repair are particularly sensitive to small-molecule
inhibitors of BER, such as PARP inhibitors.

Chemotherapy for Triple-Negative Breast Cancer

Recent studies indicate that sporadic basal-like or TN tumors bear a striking resemblance to breast tumors that arise
in hereditary BRCA1 mutation carriers. These similarities
strongly suggest that sporadic basal-like tumors might bear
defects in BRCA1-mediated DNA repair pathways (11) and
exhibit similar sensitivities to DNA-damaging agents and
PARP inhibitors.
Therefore, using a panel of breast cancer cell lines, we examined the cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine, cisplatin, and a
PARP inhibitor alone and in combination. We show that, like
BRCA1-mutant cells, basal-like TN breast cancer (TNBC)
cells are sensitive to the PARP inhibitor PJ34, gemcitabine,
and cisplatin. We further show that PJ34 acts synergistically
with both gemcitabine and cisplatin in TNBC cells, but not in
luminal breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, we show that PJ34
and gemcitabine disrupt NER, suggesting a novel mechanism
of sensitivity to these drugs in TNBC cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
All cell lines were used within 6 months of purchase.
MDAMB468, hs578t, MCF7, BT549, and BT474 cell lines were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
and maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).
T47D and HCC1806 cells (ATCC) were maintained in RPMI
1640 with 10% FBS. ATCC provides molecular authentication in support of their collection through their genomics,
immunology, and proteomic cores, as described, using DNA
barcoding and species identification, quantitative gene expression, and transcriptome analyses (18). SUM149PT cells
were obtained from Asterand Plc, where they were authenticated through gene expression data through the use of Affymetrix GeneChips and biomolecular markers, such as ER and
HER2 status. They were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium
with 10% FBS. HCC1806 cells were transfected with the
shRNAmir retroviral vector in pSM2 against nonspecific
silencing control, PARP1 or PARP2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Stable clones were maintained with 1 μg/mL puromycin and confirmed by Western blotting. The PARP
inhibitor PJ34 was purchased from EMD Biosciences. Methylene blue, MTT, and cisplatin were purchased from Sigma Chemicals. Gemcitabine was a gift from Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals.
Cell viability and colony formation assay
Cell viability was measured by an MTT assay. For the MTT
assay, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with
PJ34, gemcitabine, and cisplatin as indicated. MTT reagent
was added to the cells, which was reduced to purple formazan crystals by the mitochondria of living cells. The reduced
crystals were solubilized with DMSO, and the absorbance
was measured at 570 nm by spectrophotometry. All experiments were done in triplicate and also repeated three independent times, and data were plotted as mean ± SD. Data
from a representative experiment are shown in the figures.
For colony formation assay, HCC1806 and MCF7 were plated
at equal density and treated with 10 μmol/L PJ34, 0.6 nmol/L
gemcitabine, or 4 μmol/L cisplatin for 72 hours. After treat-

ment, cells were counted and either 500 or 1,000 cells were
plated. After 15 days, the cells were stained with methylene
blue and individual colonies were counted.
Drug combination studies
For combination studies, BT474, MCF7, HCC1806, and
MDAMB468 cells were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates
and treated with PJ34, gemcitabine, or cisplatin alone or with
the combination of PJ34 and gemcitabine or PJ34 and cisplatin at the indicated doses. MTT assays were performed after
72 hours of treatment. The data were plotted using CalcusynBiosoft software (19, 20). Combination index (CI) and isobolograms were plotted using the CI equation of Chou-Talalay
(21). A nonconstant ratio drug combination design was
used and normalized isobolograms were constructed using
Calcusyn-Biosoft software. The experimental protocol and
the isobologram plotted along with the equation for calculating
CI are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. CI < 1 was synergistic,
CI = 1 was additive, and CI > 1 was antagonistic. Study
was repeated three independent times and representative
data are shown.
γH2AX and Rad51 staining
BT474, MDAMB468, HCC1806, HCC1806shP1, and
HCC1806shP2 cells were plated overnight in chambered
slides (1,500 cells per chamber). Cells were treated with
10 μmol/L PJ34 or 5 nmol/L gemcitabine for either 1 to
4 hours for Rad51 staining or 24 hours for γH2AX. Controls
included primary alone, isotype control, and secondary
alone. After treatment, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained overnight with primary antibody for Rad51
(H-92; 1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or γH2AXSer139 (1:500 dilution; Cell Signaling). Cells were washed
with TBS/bovine serum albumin and incubated for 1 hour
at room temperature with either Alexa 488 or Alexa 594
(Invitrogen) secondary antibody for Rad51 or γH2AX, respectively. Cells were fixed in Prolong gold antifade with 4′,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen) and cured at room
temperature for 24 hours before visualizing. For quantification of Rad51 foci and γH2AX foci, at least 100 cells from
each group were visually scored. Cells showing more than
three foci were counted as positive for γH2AX or Rad51.
The ratio of Rad51 foci in the control versus the treated
groups was represented as fold change. For γH2AX, the fold
change was the ratio of γH2AX-positive cells in HCC1806
control cells versus shPARP1 and shPARP2. Images from
random fields were taken using a Nikon Eclipse E 800 microscope with an attached camera and using Spot Software
from Diagnostic Instruments (Diagnostic Instruments).
Images were taken with a 40× lens (40×/1.0 DIC H Plan
APO oil immersion lens).
Apoptosis detection
Apoptosis was detected by staining HCC1806 cells for
Annexin V and cleaved caspase-3. Cells were plated overnight
in chambered slides followed by treatment with 10 μmol/L
PJ34, 0.6 nmol/L gemcitabine, or 4 μmol/L cisplatin for
24 hours. For Annexin V-FITC, the standard manufacturer's

protocol was followed (Sigma). For caspase-3, cells were
stained with a 1:250 dilution of cleaved caspase-3 antibody
(Asp175, Cell Signaling) and visualized as mentioned above.
Nucleotide excision repair assay
MDAMB468, HCC1806, HCC1806 control, HCC1806shP1,
and HCC1806shP2 cells were grown overnight in six-well
plates (in triplicate). Cells were rinsed with PBS and then irradiated with 20 J/m2 UVC. MDAMB468 and HCC1806 cells were
treated with 10 μmol/L PJ34 or 5 nmol/L gemcitabine, whereas medium without drugs was added to PARP1- and PARP2knockdown cells. Genomic DNA was extracted (QIAamp DNA
mini kit, Qiagen) at 0 to 24 hours. Repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs) was mea-

sured using an ELISA. Briefly, genomic DNA was distributed in
triplicate onto microtiter plates precoated with 0.003% protamine sulfate. DNA lesions were detected with either 1:5,000
TDM-2 (for CPDs) or 1:5,000 64M-2 (for 6-4PPs; a gift from
Dr. Toshio Mori, Radioisotope Research Center, Nara Medical
University School of Medicine, Nara, Japan; ref. 22). The signals
were amplified and subsequently developed with 3,5,3′,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma Chemicals). Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Each experiment was repeated three
independent times, and representative data are shown.
Western blot analyses
Total cellular protein was isolated by lysing the cells in
modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Proteins

NOTE: HCC1806, MDAMB468, MCF7, and BT474 cells were treated with PJ34, gemcitabine, or cisplatin alone or a combination of
the drugs at the indicated concentrations for 72 h, and an MTT assay was performed. CI was calculated by Calcusyn-Biosoft

Biotechnology), or MCM (BD Biosciences). Protein levels from
the blots were evaluated using the gel analysis software ImageJ (NIH), and the ratio of protein levels in the control versus

Results
Sensitivity of basal-like breast cancer cells to PJ34,
gemcitabine, and cisplatin
To test our hypothesis that PARP inhibitors that target
BRCA1-pathway dysfunction might also be efficacious in the
treatment of TNBCs, a panel of sporadic TNBC cells (BT549,
HCC1806, and MDAMB468) along with a BRCA1-mutant TN
cell line (SUM149PT) and luminal breast cancer cell lines

www.aacrjournals.org

(BT474, MCF7, and T47D) were tested for their sensitivity to
PJ34 (0–62.5 μmol/L), gemcitabine (0–4.8 nmol/L), and cisplatin (0–10 μmol/L). After 72 hours of treatment, cell viability was measured by an MTT assay. All TNBC cell lines were
significantly more sensitive to PJ34, gemcitabine, and cisplatin treatment than the luminal breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A,
Supplementary Table S1). We confirmed the sensitivity of
TNBC cells to PJ34, gemcitabine, and cisplatin by colony formation assay, and as shown in Fig. 1C, HCC1806 cells were
highly sensitive to all the three drugs compared with the luminal MCF7 cells. Furthermore, all the drugs induced apoptosis in TNBC cells as evidenced by caspase-3 cleavage and
Annexin V staining (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we found that, similar
to BRCA1-deficient cells, TNBC cells were selectively sensitive
to PARP inhibition, gemcitabine, and cisplatin compared with
the other breast subtypes. Moreover, the resistance of the
luminal cell lines does not depend on HER2 status, as BT474 is
HER2/neu positive whereas MCF7 is HER2/neu negative.

Synergism between PJ34 and gemcitabine or cisplatin
Our results show that TNBC cells are selectively sensitive
to PJ34, gemcitabine, and cisplatin when used individually.
However, to determine whether inhibition of PARP by PJ34
acts in a synergistic, additive, or antagonistic fashion with
gemcitabine or cisplatin, we treated BT474, MCF7, HCC1806,
and MDAMB468 cell lines with the agents alone or in combination for 72 hours. Cells were treated either with 1 μmol/L
PJ34 and 0.0016 to 1 μmol/L gemcitabine or with 1.875 to
15 μmol/L PJ34 and 10 μmol/L cisplatin. CalcuSyn software
was used to calculate the CI and plot normalized isobolograms
(Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3; refs. 19, 21). CI < 1, CI = 1,
and CI > 1 quantitatively indicate synergism, additivity,
and antagonism, respectively. We also calculated the linear
coefficient r value to estimate the accuracy of measurement,
and all our experiments had an r value >0.90 for the medianeffect plot.
As shown in Table 1A (i and ii), TNBC cell lines HCC1806
and MDAMB468 exhibited synergism for all the different
combinations of PJ34 and gemcitabine doses, whereas the
luminal BT474 and MCF7 cell lines (Table 1A, iii and iv)
exhibited antagonistic effects for most dose combinations.
Similarly, PJ34 and cisplatin had additive to synergistic
effects in both HCC1806 and MDAMB468 cells (Table 1B,
i and ii), whereas antagonism was observed in the luminal
BT474 and MCF7 cell lines (Table 1B, iii and iv).
We also treated the cells with varied concentrations of
PJ34 and kept the concentration of gemcitabine constant,
and conversely, we kept the concentration of PJ34 constant
while changing the concentration of cisplatin. Again, TNBC
cell lines exhibited additive to synergistic effects, whereas
antagonism was observed in BT474 and MCF7 cell lines (data
not shown).

PARP knockdown sensitizes cells to gemcitabine
and cisplatin
Many PARP inhibitors are known to inhibit PARP1 and
PARP2, both of which are involved in DNA repair pathways.
Therefore, to investigate the role of PARP inhibition in sensitizing TNBC cells to gemcitabine and cisplatin, we generated stable clones of PARP1- and PARP2-knockdown cells in
the TN HCC1806 cell line. Decreased protein expression of
PARP1 and PARP2 protein was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). We then treated HCC1806 nonsilencing
control and HCC1806 shPARP1 and shPARP2 clones (two
each) with either 0.15 to 4.8 nmol/L gemcitabine or 0.25 to
8 μmol/L cisplatin for 72 hours, measured cell viability by an
MTT assay, and calculated IC50 values by Prism software. As
shown in Fig. 2B and C, both PARP1 and PARP2 knockdown
sensitized HCC1806 cells to gemcitabine and cisplatin. PARP2
knockdown significantly (P < 0.05) sensitized cells to gemcitabine compared with HCC1806 (Fig. 2B). Conversely, PARP1
knockdown significantly (P < 0.05) sensitized cells to cisplatin
(Fig. 2C).
DNA damage in basal-like breast cancer cell lines after
PJ34 and gemcitabine treatment
Because PARP and gemcitabine play a major role in DNA
repair and inhibition of DNA synthesis, respectively, we investigated the effect of PJ34 and gemcitabine on DNA damage
by staining for Rad51 foci and γH2AX, which accumulate at
sites of broken DNA.
To study Rad51 foci formation, the luminal BT474 and
TN MDAMB468 cell lines were treated with either 10 μmol/L
PJ34 or 5 nmol/L gemcitabine for 1 to 4 hours. As shown in
Fig. 3A, 4 hours of PJ34 or gemcitabine treatment increased
the Rad51 foci in MDAMB468 cells. BT474 cells had a higher

basal level of Rad51 foci, but PJ34 and gemcitabine treatment
did not further increase the number of foci. We next counted
the number of Rad51 foci and observed a 2-fold increase
after PJ34 and gemcitabine treatment (Fig. 3C, top and
middle). Similar to PJ34 treatment, knockdown of PARP1
and PARP2 also increased the number of Rad51 foci compared with HCC1806 control cells, as seen and quantified
in Fig. 3B and C (bottom).
We next treated BT474, MDAMB468, and HCC1806 cells
with 10 μmol/L PJ34 or 5 nmol/L gemcitabine for 24 hours
and stained the cells for γH2AX. As shown in Fig. 4A, following treatment, there was no increase in the number of
γH2AX-positive cells in BT474 cell line. On the other hand,
HCC1806 and MDAMB468 cell lines showed a significant
increase in the number of γH2AX-positive cells. PARP1- and

www.aacrjournals.org

PARP2-knockdown cells also exhibited 2-fold increases in the
number of γH2AX-positive cells compared with HCC1806
control cells, as shown and quantified in Fig. 4B and C. These
observations suggest that TNBC cells accumulate DNA
damage due to inhibition of PARP activity or due to inhibition
of DNA synthesis by gemcitabine. Moreover, cell cycle analysis (data not shown) illustrates that PJ34 treatment arrested
cells in the G2-M phase and gemcitabine induced an S-phase
block in TNBC cells, consistent with cell cycle arrest after
DNA damage.
Inefficient repair of UV-induced DNA damage after
PJ34 and gemcitabine treatment
Recent studies have shown that PARP is activated by UV
irradiation (23, 24); however, the role of PARP after

UV-induced DNA damage is not clear. Previously, our laboratory
showed that human and mouse BRCA1-mutant cells are defective in global genomic repair (GGR) compared with BRCA1
wild-type and luminal breast cancer cells (15). Because TNBC
cells bear resemblance to BRCA-mutant cells, we investigated
UV-induced DNA damage repair through the GGR pathway
in TNBC cells treated with either PJ34 or gemcitabine and in
PARP1- and PARP2-knockdown cells.
As shown in Fig. 5A and B, both MDAMB468 and HCC1806
cells treated with either PJ34 or gemcitabine were efficient
in repairing 6-4PPs (top). However, treatment of cells with
PJ34 or gemcitabine completely inhibited the repair of CPDs
(bottom). Similarly, knockdown of both PARP1 and PARP2

rendered the cells inefficient in repairing CPDs with no
change in the ability to repair 6-4PPs (Fig. 5C). Therefore,
the synergistic effect observed in TNBC cells between PJ34
and cisplatin or gemcitabine may be, in part, due to inhibition of the GGR pathway along with defects in other DNA
repair pathways.
Role of p63 and p73 in sensitizing basal-like breast
cancer cells to PJ34 and gemcitabine
Studies have suggested that 0% to 30% of invasive ductal
breast carcinomas express ΔNp63α protein (25–27). p73 can
induce apoptosis by p53-independent mechanisms, making it
particularly important for therapeutics in basal-like breast

carcinomas, which are most often null or mutant for p53. We
found that p63 is significantly overexpressed in TNBC cell
lines by analyzing gene expression data from a study published by Neve and colleagues (28). Because p63 can act as
an oncogene (25), the correlation between p63 expression
and PJ34- and gemcitabine-mediated cell death becomes
even more important.
As shown in Fig. 6A, PJ34-treated hs568t, MDAMB486, and
HCC1806 TN cells exhibit a more than 3-fold decrease in the
expression of ΔNp63α. ΔNp63α binds to p73 and prevents
its proapoptotic activity. We therefore analyzed the levels of
p73 protein and observed an increase in the expression of
p73 in PJ34-treated cells with a concurrent increase in the
expression of p21 (Fig. 6B). A recent study showed that
p53 and p73, through p21, can repress minichromosome
maintenance (MCM) proteins (29). Because analysis of the
published microarray data (28) revealed that MCM proteins
are overexpressed in TNBC cells, we examined the expression of MCM proteins after PJ34 treatment. As shown in
Fig. 6C, PJ34 treatment decreased the levels of MCM4 and
MCM7 in TNBC cells. We next treated PARP1- and PARP2knockdown cells with gemcitabine for 24 or 48 hours, and
as shown in Fig. 5D, gemcitabine treatment downregulated
the protein level of ΔNp63α with a concurrent increase in

p73 and p21. Thus, the results suggest that DNA damage
may trigger the p63/p73 pathway to induce cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis.

Discussion
The discovery of molecular subclasses of breast cancer
suggests that treatments may be targeted more selectively
with improved outcomes. Currently, a major challenge is
to identify such targets and more effective therapeutic regimens for TNBCs that are not responsive to endocrine therapy or trastuzumab. BRCA1 mutation carriers commonly
develop basal-like breast tumors with defects in DNA repair
and have been shown to have altered sensitivity to certain
cytotoxic DNA-damaging agents. In the current study, we
explored whether agents known to selectively target DNArepair–deficient BRCA1-mutant cells would also be effective
in TNBC cells.
Previously, we have established that BRCA1-mutant cell
lines are more sensitive to cisplatin and gemcitabine than
matched BRCA1 wild-type cells (12). Mechanisms to explain
this observation include defects in DNA repair pathways involved in HR, NER, and resolution of the intra- and interstrand DNA cross-links induced by cisplatin. In our current

study, we found that TNBC cell lines are sensitive to cisplatin
compared with luminal cells. We also report for the first time
that TNBC cell lines exhibit profound sensitivity to gemcitabine, compared with the luminal types, which are not sensitive to gemcitabine. These novel findings suggest a targeted
chemotherapeutic approach to TN and BRCA1-deficient
breast cancer.
PARP1 and PARP2 are involved in various DNA repair
mechanisms. They bind to the DNA damage sites and activate themselves by automodification. Recent studies have
suggested that decreasing PARP expression by RNA interference or by chemical inhibitors sensitizes BRCA1- and
BRCA2-deficient cells to cell death through synthetic lethality with their DNA repair defects (16, 17). Our finding that
TNBC cells share DNA repair defects with BRCA1-mutant
cells (11) suggests that PARP inhibitors may be effective
in treating these tumors, as well. In fact, our results show
that TNBC cells are more susceptible to PARP inhibition
than the luminal type of breast cancer cells. Moreover, their
sensitivity to PARP inhibitors is similar to that of BRCA1mutant cells.
Because PARP plays a major role in the response to DNA
damage, we also wished to examine whether inhibitor of
PARP acts synergistically with DNA-damaging cytotoxic
agents. Therefore, to explore the effects of drug combinations
in breast cancer subtypes, we performed isobologram analyses and found that the combination of PJ34 with gemcitabine
or cisplatin had a synergistic effect in TNBC cells. Remark-

ably, however, the combination proved antagonistic in
repair-proficient luminal breast cancer cell lines.
A recent study (30) showed that PARP1 and PARP2 are required to reactivate replication at stalled DNA forks. Thus,
the synergism observed between gemcitabine and PARP
inhibition in TNBC cells may be attributed to stalled replication forks caused by incorporation of gemcitabine into
replicating DNA and failure to reactivate replication at
the stalled fork due to inhibition of PARP activity. These
results have clinical significance and suggest that a regimen
combining a platinum agent with gemcitabine and a PARP
inhibitor may have unique efficacy in TNBC but may not
prove effective in other subtypes of breast cancers. Interestingly, knocking down PARP2 further sensitized TN cells to
gemcitabine, whereas PARP1-knockdown cells were sensitive to cisplatin. It is therefore possible that PARP1 and
PARP2 responded preferentially to DNA damage caused
by different DNA-damaging agents, and this observation is
being further investigated.
Our work shows that H2AX is phosphorylated and forms
distinct nuclear foci in response to gemcitabine in TNBC
cell lines, similar to the effect of other deoxycytidine nucleoside analogues, such as 1-h-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and
troxacitabine (31). Additionally, consistent with previous
studies (32, 33), we found that gemcitabine treatment caused
an accumulation of Rad51 nuclear foci. It is not clear if these
foci result from gemcitabine-induced stalled replication forks
and/or gemcitabine-induced accumulation of cells in S phase.

However, it is possible that stalled replication forks caused
by gemcitabine trigger HR repair of chemotherapy-induced
DNA damage.
Similarly, inhibition of PARP either by drugs or by RNAi
also led to an increase in γH2AX foci and Rad51 foci, consistent with the idea that loss of PARP might increase the
formation of DNA strand breaks that are repaired by HR
(34, 35). Recently, we (11) have shown that TNBC cells are
defective in BER; moreover, these cells may also be defective
in HR. Thus, inhibition of PARP along with defective DNA
repair mechanisms may lead to synthetic lethality.
Although UV-induced activation of PARP has been reported, the possible role of PARP in NER has not received
much attention. Studies have shown that repair of 8-oxoG
is stimulated by XPC (36) and CSB (37, 38), and because
our laboratory has shown that BRCA1-mutant cells are defective in the GGR pathway of NER, but not in transcriptioncoupled repair (15) and BER (11), we investigated the role
of PARP in GGR. We showed that PARP inhibition chemically
or by RNAi decreased the capacity of TNBC cells to remove
UVC-induced CPD lesions, a result consistent with previous
reports of PARP playing a role in GGR (39, 40). NER is known
to be involved in platinum-DNA adduct repair. Therefore, the
synergism observed with PARP inhibition and cisplatin may
be partly due to inhibition of NER. However, whether the repair is facilitated by the transcription-coupled repair pathway of NER is not established by this study, and further
investigation into the mechanism is under way.
Understanding the molecular mechanism behind drug
treatment is critical to predict the clinical efficacy of treatment. Meta-analyses of published microarray data (28) for
gene expression changes common to the basal-like and
BRCA1-mutated cell lines identified p63 and MCM family
members to be significantly overexpressed (P < 0.05) in both
groups. Our study showed that treatment of TNBC cells with

PJ34 or gemcitabine resulted in a decreased expression of
ΔNp63α with a concurrent increase in the expression of
p73 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21, which,
in turn, repressed the MCM proteins (41). MCMs are required
for licensing of origins, providing a signal for initiating replication in S phase, and are frequently overexpressed in cancer
cells (42–44). Our data showed that MCM4/MCM7 are downregulated in TNBC cells treated with PJ34. Based on these
lines of evidence, we hypothesize that PJ34 treatment leads
to downregulation of ΔNp63α with a concurrent increase in
the expression of p73 and p21, which, in turn, decreases the
expression of MCM4/MCM7, leading to cell cycle arrest and
cell death. Overall, we found that human TNBC cells, similar
to BRCA1-deficient cell lines, were more sensitive to PJ34,
gemcitabine, and cisplatin and exhibited synergistic responses to combinations of these agents. This sensitivity
seems to be dependent on inefficient DNA repair mechanisms, causing sustained DNA damage that may trigger the
p63/p73–mediated apoptotic signaling cascade. These data
suggest novel options for targeted treatment of TNBCs.
