ABSTRACT
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is essential for normal and cancer
biology. Mammalian FGF family members participate in multiple signaling pathways
by binding to heparan sulfate and FGF receptors (FGFR) with varying affinities. FGF2
is the prototype member of the FGF family and interacts with its receptor to mediate
receptor dimerization, phosphorylation, and activation of signaling pathways, such
as Ras-MAPK and PI3K pathways. Excessive mitogenic signaling through the FGF/
FGFR axis may induce carcinogenic effects by promoting cancer progression and
increasing the angiogenic potential, which can lead to metastatic tumor phenotypes.
Dysregulated FGF/FGFR signaling is associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes,
enhanced chemotherapy resistance and poor clinical outcomes. In vitro experimental
settings have indicated that extracellular FGF2 affects proliferation, drug sensitivity,
and apoptosis of cancer cells. Therapeutically targeting FGF2 and FGFR has been
extensively assessed in multiple preclinical studies and numerous drugs and
treatment options have been tested in clinical trials. Diagnostic assays are used to
quantify FGF2, FGFRs, and downstream signaling molecules to better select a target
patient population for higher efficacy of cancer therapies. This review focuses on the
prognostic significance of FGF2 in cancer with emphasis on therapeutic intervention
strategies for solid and hematological malignancies.

INTRODUCTION

role of FGF2 as a prognostic marker for different types
of malignancies. This review summarizes the biology
of FGF signaling by demonstrating biological roles of
FGF2 in regards to pathogenesis and prognosis of solid
and hematological tumors with a special focus on clinical
development of FGF2 inhibitors in the era of personalized
medicine.

The fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family consists
of 23 FGF signaling polypeptides that function as potent
mitogens [1-3]. FGFs exert broad mitogenic activity
by stimulating the growth of fibroblasts, endothelial,
and cancer cells. The family plays important roles
in embryonic development, maintenance of adult
organ systems, tissue regeneration, wound repair, and
hematopoiesis. FGF2, also known as basic FGF (bFGF),
is the prototypical and most studied member of the FGF
superfamily. FGF2 is an important regulator of cell growth
and differentiation under physiological and pathological
conditions [1-3]. Previous studies have suggested a

FGF2 isoforms, receptors, binding partners, and
signaling
FGF2 exists in low and high molecular weight
isoforms, which are translated from a single common
44735

Oncotarget

mRNA through alternative translation-initiation codons
[4]. Low molecular weight (LMW) FGF2 is an 18 kDa
protein translated from a conventional AUG start codon
[5]. LMW FGF2 is found in the cytoplasm and nucleus and
can be also secreted by target cells [6]. In order to initiate
signaling, LMW FGF2 interacts with cell surface heparan
sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and fibroblast growth
factor receptor (FGFR) in a ternary complex consisting
of FGF2, FGFR, and HSPG resulting in activation of
downstream signaling pathways, including Ras, Raf,
MAPK and ERK (Figure 1A) [7]. High molecular weight
(HMW) FGF2 isoforms (22-, 22.5-, 24-, and 34-kDa)

are produced through translation initiation at CUG sites
upstream and in frame of the AUG codon. HMW FGF2
localizes to the nucleus and signals independently of
FGFRs [8]. Similar to HMW FGF2, LMW FGF2 can
also function in the cytosol and nucleus of cells through
endocytosis of activated FGF-FGFR complexes [9].
FGFR1 and FGF2 have been shown to co-localize in
the nuclear matrix, where together they may co-activate
transcription and thus control cell proliferation (Figure
1A) [10, 11].
Five FGFRs have been identified, four of which
(1-4) are highly conserved single-pass transmembrane

FGF2 binds to extracellular domain of FGFRs which
causes receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation
of tyrosine kinase residues on cytoplasmic domain
FGF2 binds with low affinity to heparan sulfate chains
of HSPG. This interaction can activate intracellular
signaling, promote FGF2 internalization, or by
HSPG
presenting FGF2 to FGFR in proper conformation.
HSPG also act as reservoirs for FGF2 which protect
them from degradation
FGF2 binds to αvβ3 integrin leads to assembly of focal
αvβ3 integrin
adhesion plaques
Gangliosides bind FGF2 via Neu-Ac residues and acts

Free gangliosides FGF2. Exogenous gangliosides act as FGF2 antagonists
when added to endothelial cell cultures
Short heparin chains bind FGF2, thus interfering with
mitogenic signaling through activation of FGFR,
Heparin
relatively longer chains are expected to induce the
adverse effect of potentiating the mitogenic signaling

tyrosine kinase receptors [12]. The extracellular regions
of these receptors contain three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like
domains (designated as IgI, IgII, and IgIII) linked to the
cytoplasmic domain via a transmembrane α-helix (Figure
1A). FGFRs 1-3 can undergo alternative splicing during
gene expression, and the IgIII domain is composed of
an invariant IgIIIa exon alternatively spliced to IgIIIb or
IgIIIc. The expression of IgIIIb and IgIIIc is important in
defining FGF signaling specificity. While FGF1 binds to
all FGFRs, FGF2 binds to FGFR1 (IIIb), FGFR1 (IIIc),
FGFR2 (IIIc), and FGFR4 [2]. It has been reported that
LMW FGF2 predominantly binds to FGFR1 (IIIc) and
weakly to the other FGFRs [5, 13]. The cytoplasmic
domain of FGFRs 1-4 contains a juxtamembrane split
kinase domain, which contains tyrosine kinase motifs and
a C-terminal tail [12]. Although FGFR5 lacks intracellular
tyrosine kinase domain, this receptor can bind to multiple
FGF ligands acting as a negative regulator of signaling
[14].
FGF2 utilizes HSPGs, such as syndecans (SDC), as
binding partners to stabilize the FGF-FGFR interaction
and enhance resistance to proteolysis [15, 16]. FGF2
cannot activate FGFRs in cells lacking heparan sulfate
[17]. After the binding of FGF and HSPG to FGFR to form
a ternary FGF:FGFR:HSPG complex, FGFRs dimerize
leading to conformational changes in FGFR structure
and subsequent intermolecular transphosphorylation of
multiple cytoplasmic tyrosine residues (Figure 1A) [12,
18]. FGFR transmits extracellular signals to two main
intracellular substrates, which are phospholipase C-γ1
(PLC-γ1) (also known as FRS1) and FGFR substrate 2
(also known as FRS2) (Figure 1A). The phosphorylation
of FGFR1 tyrosine residues creates binding sites for
SH2 domain of PLC-γ required for phosphorylation and
activation of PLC-γ. Conversely, FRS2 constitutively
associates with the juxtamembrane region of the FGFR.
The phosphorylation of FRS2 is essential for activation
of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt (PI3K-Akt) signaling
pathways in cancer and endothelial cells (Figure 1A) [12,
19].
FGF2 also interacts with immobilized molecules
bound to extracellular matrix (ECM), including cell
membrane receptors and soluble molecules (Table 1,
Figure 1B). The complex interactions between FGF2
and these molecules control bioavailability, stability, and
concentration of FGF2 in the microenvironment [20].
FGF2 can tightly bind HSPG in ECM and is only released
through the action of FGF-binding protein (FGF-BP),
which is a critical controller of FGF bioavailability (Table
1, Figure 1B). In addition, the binding of FGF to heparin,
released HSPG, or cell surface-bound HSPG also regulate
FGF bioavailability and the interactions with FGFRs
(Table 1, Figure 1B). Conversely, thrombospondin-1
(TSP-1) and pentraxin 3 (PTX3) prevent the interaction
of FGF2 with cell surface HSPGs and FGFRs. Similarly;
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

xcFGFR1 (a soluble form of the extracellular portion of
FGFR1) binds FGF2 and prevents FGF2/FGFR interaction
(Table 1, Figure 1B).
Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids bound to
cell membranes regulating growth of a wide variety of
normal cells by binding to FGFs. Gangliosides are highly
synthesized in metastatic tumors and are known to shed
into the ECM. Integrins are transmembrane receptors that
regulate the response to soluble FGF2 in endothelial cells.
The interaction between αvβ3 integrin and FGF2 promotes
endothelial cell proliferation by activating the MAPK
pathway [21]. In addition, the binding of fibrinogen to
FGF2 requires αvβ3 integrin to promote endothelial cell
proliferation (Table 1, Figure 1B). These findings indicate
that FGF2 bioactivity and interaction with FGFR is highly
regulated by a complex network of interactions with
various FGF2 binding partners.

ROLES
OF
FGF2
PROGRESSION

IN

TUMOR

Accumulating evidence suggests that FGF2/FGFR
signaling is involved in several biological functions, such
as embryonic development, tissue regeneration, wound
repair, and normal hematopoiesis [1-3]. Expression of
FGF2 and FGFRs in normal cells is highly regulated,
and termination of FGF2 signaling is achieved through
receptor internalization (Figure 2A) [1-3]. However,
FGF2/FGFR signaling in cancer cells is dysregulated,
which may contribute to the pathogenesis of many types
of cancer (Figure 2A). Several studies have shown that
FGF2 is a key tumor-promoting factor in the tumor
microenvironment. The following section reviews current
knowledge of the molecular pathways associated with
FGF2 signaling in cancer, which represents a critical
step for the implementation of strategies toward the
development of personalized cancer therapy.

Deregulation of FGFR signaling
FGFR amplification and/or upregulation occur in
cancer due to deregulated transcription or chromosomal
amplification (Figure 2A) [22]. The upregulation
of FGFR1 induces cellular transformation of nontransformed cells [23]. FGFR2 upregulation is associated
with poor prognosis in patients of multiple cancer types
[24]. Furthermore, FGFR2 amplification has been shown
to be accompanied with C-terminal exon abrogation,
which regulates receptor internalization [25]. Impaired
termination of FGFR signaling leads to continuous
receptor activation [22]. In addition, mutation of FGFR
can also render it insensitive to endocytosis by maintaining
its expression at the cell surface [22]. A number of
germline activating point mutations of FGFRs have been
identified in human cancers and are associated with poor

survival and chemoresistance [26, 27]. Mutations in the
extracellular domain of FGFRs facilitate ligand binding,
while mutations in transmembrane and kinase domains
lead to constitutive activation of receptors (Figure 2A)
[22]. Furthermore, alternative splicing of the third Ig-like
domain could promote tumorigenesis. Paracrine signaling
typically occurs through FGFR-IIIb that is expressed
on mesenchymal cells and -IIIc expressed on epithelial
cells [22]. In cancer models, however, the switch from
FGFR IIIb to FGFR IIIc by alternative splicing results in
autocrine activation of the receptor (Figure 2A) [28]. For
example, FGFR2-IIIb to IIIc switch is related to increased
invasiveness in bladder and prostate cancers [29, 30]. In
addition, FGFR1-IIIc has been upregulated in pancreatic
cancer where it is regarded as a strong oncogene [31].

protease production, and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the
full mitogenic and chemotactic responses of FGF2 in
endothelial cells require activation of ERK1/2 and protein
kinase C (PKC) signaling pathways [35]. FGF2 upregulates
plasmin-plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP) production in endothelial cells
eventually leading to ECM degradation and angiogenesis
[36]. In addition, the response of endothelial cells to FGF2
can be regulated by integrins [21]. Immobilized FGF2
binds to αvβ3 integrin causing endothelial cell adhesion,
migration, proliferation, and morphogenesis (Figure 2B)
[37]. There is also considerable cross-talk between FGF
and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling,
whereby FGF-induced signaling promotes resistance to
VEGF receptor signaling for blocking of the VEGF [38].
Moreover, transient expression of FGF2 in endothelial
cells control the expression of genes implicated in cell
cycle, differentiation, adhesion, and cell survival [39].
Taken together, these data suggest an important role of
FGF2 in promoting endothelial cell angiogenesis (Figure
2B).

FGF2 as pro-angiogenic agent
FGF2 is an extremely potent pro-angiogenic
growth factor. FGF2 exerts its effects on endothelial
cells via a paracrine mode after being released by tumor
and stromal cells or through mobilization from ECM
(Figure 2B) [32]. In addition, FGF2 plays autocrine
roles in endothelial cells [32]. It has been reported that
endothelial cells predominantly express FGFR1 and to
some extent FGFR2 [33, 34]. Activation of these receptors
by FGF2 leads to endothelial cell proliferation, migration,

FGF2 as mitogen for tumor cells
Although FGF2 levels are elevated in several
human cancers, FGF2 levels do not always correlate
with microvessel density [40]. For example, in a study

conducted by Kuwahara et al, majority of pancreatic
ductal carcinomas were positive for VEGF and FGF2
[41]. A significant correlation was observed between
VEGF expression and MVD but not between FGF2 and
MVD [41]. However, in a study conducted by Garcia
de la Torre et al, FGF2 expression was high in primary
parathyroid hyperplasia (PPH) and FGF2 scores and
MVD were significantly correlated [42]. Therefore,
FGF2 may contribute to cancer progression through
alternative mechanisms involve acting directly on tumor
cells [19]. Mutations in genes encoding FGFs and
FGFRs deregulate FGFR signaling [43, 44]. However, no

activating mutations have been reported as yet for FGF2
[44]. FGF2-induced activation of FGFR signaling and
subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling
pathways in cancer cells [19, 45]. FGF2 contributes to
tumor progression through enhanced expression and/or
release from tumor, endothelial, or stromal cells as well as
release from local reservoirs in the ECM (Figure 2B) [43].
Secretion of proteases leads to release of the sequestered
FGF2 [43]. Therefore, FGF2 functions in an autocrine or
paracrine manner in cancer cells (Figure 2B).

[52]. In addition, FGF2 plays a role in self-renewal, cell
survival, and cell adhesion of human embryonic stem cells
[53]. In adult hematopoiesis, FGF2 induces proliferation
of stromal cells of bone marrow [54]. FGF2 also induces
the production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) [55] and counteracts
the suppressive effect of transforming growth factor
beta (TGF-β) on myeloid progenitor cells [56]. Myeloid
precursor cells can be induced by FGF2 to give rise to
erythroid progenitors [57]. In the absence of FGF2,
myeloid progenitors generate cells of the neutrophilgranulocyte lineage upon FGF2 induction [58].
Neoplastic cells that define each hematological
tumor are descendants of a specific lineage of the
hematopoietic process. The involvement of FGF2
in various stages of hematopoiesis suggests that its
dysregulation can result in hematological cancers [59].
FGFRs are expressed on all cell types of haematopoietic
origin, and deregulation of FGFR gene expression or
mutation has been observed in haematologic malignancies
[59]. The ability of FGF2 to induce stem cell proliferation
and differentiation implies that FGF2 is involved in very
early stages of hematopoiesis. It has been reported that
lymphoma cell lines express FGF2 and FGFRs and release
FGF2 into culture media [45].

Tumor progression to metastatic stage is promoted
by fibroblasts in tumor stroma through secretion of
multiple paracrine factors [46, 47]. FGF2 secreted by
stromal fibroblasts induces tumor cell proliferation
via FGFR paracrine signaling (Figures 2A, 2B) [48].
In addition, fibroblasts within tumor stroma can be
activated by FGF2 secreted from endothelial and tumor
cells (Figure 2B) [49]. Activated fibroblasts also produce
proteases, such as MMPs that degrade ECM and promote
secretion of growth factors including FGF2 in the tumor
microenvironment [50].

Dysregulated downstream FGF2/FGFR signaling
pathway in hematological tumors
Growing evidence supports a role of FGF2 in
hematopoiesis starting at early stages of development
through adulthood. In early stages of development,
FGF2 has an important role in the proliferation of
hemangioblasts, which are common progenitors of
hematopoietic and endothelial cells [51] that play a central
role in hematopoietic and angiogenic differentiation

the activation of NF-κB signaling leading to enhanced
B-cell survival [65]. Alternatively, NF-κB may serve
as a transcription factor for the FGF2 gene regulating
expression and release of FGF2 by LMP1 [66, 67]. This
process could be of clinical importance for determining the
relationship between EBV status and FGF2 levels in HL
patients (Figure 3). IL-1β, which is expressed in subsets of
cells in the HL tumor microenvironment, activates PI3K
signaling pathway to upregulate FGF2 production through
NF-κB [67].
The interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling pathway has
also been implicated in tumor progression [68, 69]. In
multiple myeloma, stromal-derived IL-6 stimulates FGF2
expression in tumor cells, which in turn stimulates the
secretion of IL-6 [70]. In addition, IL-6 and FGF2 together
can enhance proliferation of myeloma cells [71]. In HL,
IL-6 and its receptors are expressed by HRS cells (Figure
3) [72, 73]. Moreover, IL-6 is upregulated in serum
of HL patients resulting in poor prognosis [74]. FGF2
upregulates IL-6 gene expression in the fibroblast NIH3T3 cell line [75]. Moreover, in a basal cell carcinoma
cell line, IL-6 mediates upregulation of FGF2 through
activation of JAK/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt pathways which
are aberrantly activated in HL [65]. Therefore, IL-6
and FGF2 may be involved in paracrine and autocrine
interactions to promote chemoresistance in relapsed/

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a rare B-cell malignant
neoplasm characterized by a paucity of malignant Hodgkin
and Reed-Sternberg cells (HRS cells) embedded within
an inflammatory infiltrate [60]. FGF2 causes aberrant
signaling activities in HRS cells involving SDC1, NF-κB,
IL-6, Ras/ERK, and JAK/STAT as shown below.
SDC1 regulates bioavailability, dimerization,
and interaction of FGF2 with FGFRs [20]. Witzig and
colleagues reported that SDC1 was expressed in the bone
marrow of patients with plasma cell proliferative disorders
[61]. In line with this, increased expression of FGF2 and
SDC1 was also reported in HL cell lines [68]. Overall,
findings suggest that increased expression of FGF2,
FGFR, and SCD1 is associated with poor prognosis and
chemoresistance [62].
Activation of the NF-κB pathway is a wellestablished mechanism for protection of tumor cells
from apoptosis [63, 64]. In HL, NF-κB is constitutively
activated and represents an important step for the
proliferation of neoplastic HRS cells (Figure 3) [65].
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a risk factor for HL [74]. In
EBV-positive (EBV+) HL, the EBV oncoprotein, latent
membrane protein-1 (LMP1), has been implicated in

refractory HL.
Components of the Ras/ERK pathway are
aberrantly expressed in malignancies and associated with
chemoresistance [76]. MEK/ERK signaling pathway
is essential for proliferation and survival of neoplastic
HRS cells (Figure 3) [77]. FGF2 induces MEK signaling
to upregulate anti-apoptotic proteins and enhance
chemoresistance [78]. In addition, FGF2 mediates
chemoresistance to doxorubicin in endothelial cells by
inhibiting the pro-apoptotic protein ASK1, which is a
member of the MEKK family [79].
The Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of
transcription (JAK/STAT) is a frequently altered pathway
in the pathogenesis of HL [80]. The JAK/STAT pathway
has been implicated in FGF2-induced chemoresistance in
human cancer cells [81]. The JAK2 inhibitor lestaurtinib
can overcome JAK/STAT-induced drug resistance in
refractory HL cell lines [82]. Therefore, FGF2 may
promote chemoresistance by deregulation of JAK/STAT
signaling in HRS cells of relapsed and refractory HL
patients (Figure 3).
The above studies demonstrated key downstream
signaling pathways in HL, including cell growth, survival,
and angiogenesis. It seems clear that the main pathways
contributing to HL are regulated, at least in part, by FGF2
(Figure 3). Therefore, clinical trials using agents that target
FGF pathway may be promising for treatment of HL.

blot, and qRT-PCR techniques (Tables 2 and 3). Upto-date diagnostics and antibodies that allow detection
and precise quantification of FGF2 are listed in Table 4.
Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies
have shown that FGF2 staining is heterogeneous and
significantly increased in malignant tissues compared to
benign or normal tissues (Tables 2 and 3). The differential
expression and localization of FGF2 was also studied
in different cancers. For example, FGF2 expression is
generally limited to the cytoplasm of breast cancer tissues,
while it is exclusively expressed in the nuclei of normal
mammary tissues. Similarly, FGF2 is strongly expressed
in the cytoplasm of malignant melanocytes and prostate
cancer tissues, while it is almost entirely restricted to the
nuclei of benign cells. In pancreatic cancer cells, FGF2
staining is intense in both the cytoplasm and nucleus,
while it is weak in normal control tissues. Different
expression and localization of FGF2 suggests that FGF2
and different members of FGFR may have different
functions and signaling in various cancers. Moreover,
FGF2 expression was elevated in tumor stroma, including
inflammatory cells, myofibroblasts, and endothelial
cells in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate carcinomas,
respectively (Table 2). These findings suggest that FGF2
can modulate tumor progression by activating signaling
pathways in cancer-associated fibroblasts, endothelial
cells, and cancer cells. In addition, fibroblasts that are
abundant in the stroma of carcinomas at advanced stages
of disease can mediate resistance to treatment via FGF2
secretion [83]. Additional studies on tissue sections have
revealed that high FGF2 intratumoral levels are associated
with advanced tumor stages of bladder, glioma, head and
neck, liver, and prostate cancers (Table 2).
There is an urgent need for the identification of
novel prognostic biomarkers to improve treatment of
poor outcome cancer patients. It is worth noting that in
the vast majority of studies, high serum and intratumoral
FGF2 levels were associated with reduced cancer patient
survival. In addition, high intratumoral and serum levels
of FGF2 were associated with relapse and/or recurrence in
various cancers such as bladder, breast, esophageal cancers
and HL (Tables 2 and 3). In spite of a few contradictory
finding, FGF2 is considered a significant tumor biomarker
and a potential therapeutic target. Ongoing and future
clinical trials are warranted to determine whether FGF2
could be incorporated in cancer prognosis and whether
FGF targeting therapies have a favorable effect on cancer
recurrence and mortality.

CLINICAL PROGNOSTIC VALUE AND
FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF FGF2
IN SOLID AND HEMATOLOGICAL
TUMORS
Several studies have compared FGF2 serum levels
in cancer patients to those in healthy volunteers (Tables 2
and 3). FGF2 expression in sera quantified by ELISA was
strongly increased in cancer patients compared to healthy
donors. Significant correlations between serum FGF2
levels and tumor stage, size, and metastasis were reported
in endometrial, colorectal, esophageal, head and neck,
liver, renal, and testicular cancers. However, no significant
correlation was observed between increased serum FGF2
levels and tumor grade in bladder, breast, lung, and
prostate cancers. In all leukemia and lymphoma studies,
there was no correlation between increased serum levels
of FGF2 and microvessel density or stage of the disease.
However, high serum FGF2 levels were significantly
correlated with tumor bulkiness in Non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (NHL). Therefore, the levels of serum FGF2
may have prognostic significance in these cancers, and
quantification of FGF2 may provide an indirect, noninvasive way to monitor patients with high risk of relapse
from solid and hematological tumors (Tables 2 and 3).

TARGETING THE FGF2/FGFR PATHWAY
IN CANCER
The trend in cancer personalized medicine is to
search for biomarkers to predict a patient’s response to
the targeted therapy and the emergence of secondary
resistance [84]. High expression of FGF2 correlates with
44750

Oncotarget

a worse survival for relapsed/refractory cancer patients
(Tables 2 and 3). Therefore, targeting FGF signaling
may provide opportunities for personalized therapy in
those patients. Several FGF2/FGFR inhibitors have
shown promising anticancer and antiangiogenic efficacy
in several in vitro assays and in vivo preclinical animal
models (Table 5, Figure 4). Clinical studies on these
compounds have been conducted in the last decade to
evaluate their safety, efficacy, and tolerability (Table
6). Ongoing clinical trials are recruiting patients with
metastatic, advanced, or relapsed/ refractory cancers to
evaluate the importance of blocking the FGF2/FGFR
signaling in progressive and poor outcome cancer patients
(Table 6).
It has been reported that various molecules can
inhibit FGF2 (ligand) activity, binding, or expression in
endothelial and tumor cells (Table 5, Figure 4). FGF ligand
traps, such as FP-1039, block FGF2 interaction with FGFR
(Tables 5 and 6, Figure 4) [85]. A phase I clinical trial
was conducted to investigate the safety and tolerability
of FP-1039 in advanced solid tumors (Table 6) [86].
FP-1039 is a soluble FGFR1 Fc fusion protein that was
engineered to strongly bind all mitogenic FGF ligands.
This compound showed promising results and inhibited
FGF-mediated cell proliferation and angiogenesis in
lung and endometrial cancer models [86]. AGM-1470,
miRNA 646, and interferon alpha downregulate FGF2
expression in cancer cells (Table 5, Figure 4). A phase II
clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of
pegintron (peginterferon alpha-2b) in patients with stage
IV metastatic melanoma overexpressing FGF2 (Table
6) [87]. The results showed that peginterferon alpha-2b
suppressed FGF2 levels in 97% of patients with metastatic
melanoma to reference range with a median progression
free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of 2.0 and
9.7 months, respectively (Table 6) [87].
Other FGF2 antagonists are under investigation
for cell line and animal preclinical cancer models. Small
molecules, such as sm27, pentosan, and PI-88 as well
as proteins such as pentraxin-3 inhibit FGF2 binding to
FGFRs (Table 5, Figure 4) [3]. The capability of FGF2 to
bind heparin/heparan sulfate indicates that molecules able
to interfere with this interaction may act as angiogenesis
inhibitors. On this basis, compounds such as suramin,
which mimic heparin, can interfere with FGF2 signaling
(Table 5). Thalidomide, PAMPS, sirolimus, suramin, and
platelet factor 4 inhibit FGF2-induced angiogenesis, while
anvirzel inhibits FGF2 export via Na+/K+ pumps (Table 5).
It has been reported that direct inhibition of FGFRs
using small molecule inhibitors may be effective in cancer
treatment. Several FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
are currently in early clinical development (Tables 5 and
6, Figure 4), and many of them exhibit dual specificity for
FGFR and VEGFR due to similarity in the ATP binding
pocket structure [85]. The ﬁrst generation of inhibitors
were developed as VEGFR and PDGFR inhibitors, but
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

also can inhibit FGFR [88]. These compounds were
successful in clinical trials and some of these drugs
and drug combinations were subsequently approved by
regulatory administrations worldwide for the treatment of
different cancers (Tables 5 and 6).
Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) granted approval to Lenvima (lenvatinib,
developed by Eisai) based on the results of a study on 392
patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive,
radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer
(DTC) who were randomly assigned to receive either
Lenvima or a placebo. Study results showed that Lenvimatreated participants lived a median of 18.3 months (PFS)
compared to a median of 3.6 months for participants
who received placebo. Moreover, approximately two
thirds of participants treated with Lenvima showed a
reduction in tumor size compared to only two percent
of participants who received placebo. Similarly, FDA
recently approved Iclusig (ponatinib, developed by
ARIAD Pharmaceuticals), which is a multi-tyrosine kinase
inhibitor for the treatment of adult patients with chronic
myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Table
5) [89]. Moreover, the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor
Votrient (pazopanib, developed by GlaxoSmithKline) was
approved by FDA to treat patients with advanced renal
cell cancer and patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma
who have received chemotherapy in the past (Tables 5 and
6) [90].
Dovitinib (TKI-258, CHIR-258, developed by
Novartis) is a potent VEGFR, PDGFR and FGFR inhibitor.
Dovitinib showed promising anticancer and antiangiogenic
activity against multiple myeloma and colon cancer
models [91, 92]. A phase II trial was conducted to evaluate
the safety and tolerability of Dovitinib in relapsed or
refractory multiple myeloma patients, who are with or
without t(4;14) chromosomal translocation (Table 6). The
t(4;14) translocation is observed in approximately 1520% of multiple myeloma patients, and it is associated
with upregulation of FGFR3 and poor prognosis [93, 94].
Upregulation of FGFR3 occurs in nearly 70% of patients
with the t(4;14) translocation. Therefore, development of
inhibitors such as Dovitinib may show promise in t(4;14)
multiple myeloma patients [94]. Further phase II clinical
trials were conducted on Dovitinib for treatment of other
types of cancers including lung, bladder and gastric
cancers (Table 6).
Other investigational multi-kinase inhibitors, such
as Brivanib, Orantinib, and Lucitanib, are currently
progressing into phases II and III of clinical trials
(Tables 5 and 6). Recent clinical trials have assessed the
combination of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with cytotoxic
agents (Table 6). Combination strategies that involve
the blockade of FGFR signaling with cytotoxic agents
have the best clinical outcome for cancer treatment [85].
Recently, Vargatef (nintedanib, developed by Boehringer
Ingelheim) was approved in the EU based on the results
44751

Oncotarget

of a phase III study comparing Vargatef plus docetaxel to
placebo plus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced/
metastatic non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) after
first-line therapy in over 1,300 patients in 27 countries
[95]. Vargatef is an oral triple angiokinase inhibitor that
simultaneously inhibits the VEGFR, PDGFR, and FGFR
signaling pathways. The results indicated that treatment
with Vargatef and docetaxel significantly extended the
median overall survival from 10.3 to 12.6 months for
patients with adenocarcinoma compared to placebo and
docetaxel, with a quarter of patients surviving for two
years or more with minimum side effects [95]. Several
clinical trials are ongoing currently with compounds
targeted for FGF2; a phase III study was designed to
compare the safety and efficacy of a multi-tyrosine kinase
inhibitor, masitinib, in combination with bortezomib and
dexamethasone to placebo in combination with bortezomib
and dexamethasone in patients with relapsing multiple
myeloma. Masitinib is an orally active and bioavailable
compound that is a weak inhibitor of FGFR3 [96].
More recently, second-generation inhibitors
targeting FGFRs with high selectivity have been
developed (Table 5, Figure 4). For example, Debio 1347,
developed by Debiopharm Group, a Swiss-based global
biopharmaceutical company, is an orally bioavailable
inhibitor of FGFRs 1-3 that inhibits FGFR-mediated
signal transduction pathways and consequently tumor
cell proliferation and angiogenesis [97]. Debio 1347 will
be used for personalized cancer treatment through the
development of a companion diagnostic. It is currently
being evaluated in Europe and the USA in a phase I trial
to evaluate its safety and tolerability in patients with
advanced solid tumors displaying alterations in FGFRs 1,
2, or 3 genes (Tables 5 and 6) [97]. Similarly, AZD4547,
developed by AstraZeneca, is an orally tolerated inhibitor
of FGFRs 1-3 [98]. AZD4547 inhibits FGFR kinase
activity and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo [98]. This
compound is currently being tested for safety and efficacy
in different clinical trials against advanced tumors
(Table 6). Other small molecule FGFR inhibitors, such
as BGJ398, JNJ-42756493, ARQ 087, LY2874455, and
TAS-120, are currently under clinical investigation for
advanced, relapsed or refractory tumors and most of these
trials are still recruiting patients (Tables 5 and 6). Other
selective small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as
PD 161570, PD 173074, PD 166285 dihydrochloride, PD
166866, FIIN hydrochloride, SU 5402, and SSR128129E
are currently being tested for their antitumor activity
on cell lines and in vivo preclinical models (Table 5).
Monoclonal antibodies specifically targeting particular
FGFR isoforms are also being developed. MFGR1877S
(developed by Genentech) is a human anti-FGFR3
monoclonal antibody that inhibits tumor progression of
bladder carcinoma and multiple myeloma xenografts in
mice by antagonizing FGFR3 signaling [99]. A phase I
clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the response
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to MFGR1877S in patients with relapsed or refractory
multiple myeloma (Tables 5 and 6). Similarly, BAY
1179470 (developed by Bayer) is a human anti-FGFR2
monoclonal antibody. BAY 1179470 showed antitumor
activity in gastric cancer xenograft models with high
FGFR2 expression [100]. The anti-FGFR2 antibody BAY
1179470 is currently in Phase I testing in subjects with
advanced, refractory solid tumors (Tables 5 and 6)

CONCLUSIONS
FGF2 is frequently dysregulated in cancer, especially
in advanced stages of disease. The upregulation of FGF2
or FGFRs can promote resistance to chemotherapy.
FGF2 is currently being evaluated in clinical studies as
a potential predictive biomarker for hematological and
solid tumors. In addition, FGF2/FGFR inhibitors are being
developed and evaluated as monotherapy or as part of a
combination therapy for the treatment of different types
of cancer. Identifying patients with advanced, relapsed or
refractory cancers that would benefit from FGF2/FGFR
signaling inhibition will allow for better treatment options
of those patients in the era of personalized medicine.
