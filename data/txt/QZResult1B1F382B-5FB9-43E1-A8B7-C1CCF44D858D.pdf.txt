NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1
(NQO1 ), NQO1
along with NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2/ (NQO2/), and
wild-type (WT) mice were exposed to five once weekly doses
of mitomycin C. The mice were euthanized 15 weeks after the
first dose. Blood cell counts and histologic analyses were done.
WT and NQO2/ mice showed hypocellularity and a significant increase in adipocytes in bone marrow. They also
showed anemia because of the loss of RBC and hemoglobin.
The neutrophils and platelets were reduced, whereas other
blood cell types and tissues were normal. Interestingly,
NQO1/ mice showed a complete resistance to mitomycin
C–induced bone marrow cytotoxicity and reduction in RBC,
hemoglobin, and neutrophils. NQO1+/ mice also showed
limited resistance to mitomycin C–induced bone marrow
cytotoxicity. These data show a major in vivo role of NQO1 in
metabolic activation of mitomycin C with implications in
mitomycin C chemotherapy. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):7966–71]

Introduction
The bioreductive activation of drugs plays an important role in
the efficacy of antitumor drugs (1). Bioreductive drug development
is based on two major factors. The first is to develop drugs that are
activated by specific reductase enzymes and the second is to
identify tumor types that are rich in those enzymes (2). In addition,
bioreductive drug development is also based on differences in
oxygen content and cellular pH between normal and tumor tissues
(1, 2). Several quinones occupy special place in bioreductive
therapy because of their tendency to undergo reductive activation
by different reductases in aerobic and hypoxic conditions. These
include mitomycin C, indoloquinone EO9, diaziquone (AZQ),
methyl-DZQ, and dinitrophenylaziridine CB1954 (3). Mitomycin C
and its analogues are effective against several tumor tissue types,
including colon, breast, head, and neck (4). Bioreductive metabolism leading to the formation of electrophilic metabolites,
including 2,7-diaminomitosene, capable of binding with DNA to
cause its damage is the basic cause of cytotoxicity and antitumor
activity of mitomycin C (5).
The cytosolic NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and
NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 (NQO2) are flavoproteins that
catalyze the metabolic reduction of quinones (6). The cellular
studies have provided evidence for and against the role of cytosolic
NQO1 in metabolic activation of mitomycin C (2). The cellular

studies using dicumarol as NQO1 enzyme inhibitor indicated that
bioactivation by the obligatory two-electron reducing enzyme
NQO1 might be especially important for the cytotoxicity of
mitomycin C (2, 7, 8). On the other hand, the cells expressing
higher levels of NQO1 failed to show increased sensitivity to
mitomycin C compared with cells of similar origin containing
normal levels of NQO1 (9, 10). The cellular studies have shown a
role of NQO2 in metabolic activation of mitomycin C and other
drugs leading to cytotoxicity and cell death (11, 12). Therefore, a
further assessment of the role of NQO1 and NQO2 in mitomycin C
activation especially in an in vivo model is warranted to
understand the role of these reductases in mitomycin C activation.
This is also important because NQO1 and NQO2 are reductases
and generally present in higher levels in tumors than normal
tissues of the same origin (13). High NQO1 levels have been
reported in several cell types, including non–small cell lung cancer,
colon cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and melanoma (2, 13).
Among the human tumor materials received directly from the
patients, high NQO1 levels have been observed in liver, lung, colon,
and breast tumors (14, 15).
In the present studies, we investigated in vivo role of NQO1 and
NQO2 in metabolic activation of mitomycin C and toxicity. Wildtype (WT) and NQO2/ mice showed bone marrow hypocellularity, significant loss of RBC and hemoglobin, and decrease in
neutrophils compared with control mice. Interestingly, NQO1/
mice showed complete resistance to mitomycin C–induced bone
marrow cytotoxicity, loss of RBC/hemoglobin and neutrophils, and
morbidity. In addition, the NQO1+/ mice also showed limited
resistance to mitomycin C–induced bone marrow toxicity and
morbidity. These results combined suggest that NQO1 present in
WT, NQO2/, and NQO1+/ mice activated mitomycin C to
metabolites that caused bone marrow cytotoxicity, anemia, and
morbidity.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals. Mitomycin C was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Neutral
buffered formalin (10%) for tissue fixation was purchased from Fisher
Scientific.
WT, NQO1/, NQO1+/, and NQO2/ mice. C57BL6 NQO1/,
NQO1+/, and NQO2/ mice were generated previously in this laboratory
as described (16, 17). These mice were bred and housed in the institutional
animal facility. All animal studies were carried out with prior approval from
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and done in accordance
with the animal ethics committee’s guidelines.
Mitomycin C injection. Groups of 20 mice (10 male and 10 female) of
8 weeks of age from each strain (WT, NQO1/, NQO1+/, and NQO2/)
were made for different dosage regimen of mitomycin C. Mitomycin C was
dissolved in normal saline and injected into each group in each strain at a
dose of 0, 1, and 2.5 mg/kg body weight, respectively, through i.p. route
(0 mg control groups received only normal saline). Likewise, five doses of
mitomycin C were given at a weekly interval. The mice were observed daily
and the morbidity rate in each group was recorded. Ten weeks after final
( fifth) injection, all mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and euthanized

NQO1 and Mitomycin C Activation

Figure 1. Hematologic analysis and morbidity in mice untreated and treated with mitomycin C. WT, NQO1/, NQO1+/, and NQO2/ mice were i.p. injected
with mitomycin C in concentrations as shown. Five once weekly doses were injected. The morbidity in mice was recorded. The mice were euthanized and sacrificed
15 wks after first injection of mitomycin C. The blood and tissues were collected. Blood was analyzed for RBC counts and hemoglobin content. A, RBC counts.

by cervical dislocation. The abdominal and thoracic cavity of the mice was
surgically opened in an aseptical manner. Approximately 500 AL of whole
blood were collected from each animal by direct heart puncture and
transferred immediately into microtainer tubes containing EDTA and mixed
gently and thoroughly.
Hematologic analysis. Whole blood collected from each animal was
subjected to analysis for different blood variables, such as WBC, RBC,
platelet count, differential count that included neutrophil, basophil,
eosinophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts, and hemoglobin level, using
Advia 120 hematology autoanalyzer.
Serum chemistry. Blood collected (without anticoagulant) from
separate groups of WT, NQO1/, NQO1+/, and NQO2/ mice, each
injected with 0 or 2.5 mg/kg body weight of mitomycin C, was used for
obtaining serum. The sera samples were used for measuring the blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels to assess the kidney function
status.
Histopathologic analysis. Different organs and tissues [i.e., liver,
spleen, thymus, lymph nodes (salivary, inguinal, and mesenteric), lung,
heart, kidney, and femur bones] were collected aseptically from these
control and treated mice and washed in cold PBS. The organs were
then fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for not less than 24 h.
Decalcification of femur bones was done using TBD-2 decalcifier by
previously described procedure (17). The tissues were subsequently
embedded in paraffin and sections were made and stained with H&E

stain. Kidney sections were also stained for iron to rule out hemosiderosis.
The stained tissue sections were analyzed for histopathology under light
microscope.
Bone marrow analysis for NQO1 and NQO2. Femur bones surgically
collected from WT, NQO1/, NQO1+/, and NQO2/ mice were washed
in cold PBS and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The two ends of the
bone were cut with sterile blade and the bone marrow cells were flushed
using a syringe and needle, with f100 AL of ice-cold lysate buffer into
clean Eppendorf tubes (17). Total cell lysate of the bone marrow cells was
made by homogenization using a micropestle followed by centrifugation at
12,000  g for 10 min at 4jC. Protein samples (300 Ag) from each were used
for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using antirabbit NQO1 antiserum
raised in our laboratory and goat polyclonal NQO2 antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) for NQO1 and NQO2, respectively.
NQO1 enzyme activity assay. Bone marrow cell lysates obtained from
WT, NQO1/, NQO1+/, and NQO2/ mice (200 Ag total protein each)
were used in separate experiments in a final reaction mixture containing
25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.18 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA),
5 mmol/L flavin adenine dinucleotide, 0.01% Tween 20, 200 mmol/L NADH,
and 50 mmol/L 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. The reaction was monitored by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm due to reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. This gives the total NQO activity.
The same experiment was repeated in the presence of 20 mmol/L dicumarol, a specific inhibitor of NQO1. The activity obtained in the presence

of dicoumarol was subtracted from the total activity to obtain the
dicumarol-inhibitable NQO1 activity. The experiments were repeated thrice
independently.
Spectrophotometric analysis of mitomycin C metabolism. In vitro
analysis of mitomycin C metabolism in the presence of WT, NQO1/,
NQO1+/, and NQO2/ bone marrow cytosols was carried out with BSA
as control in 10 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.8) by previously described procedure (18). Protein samples (500 Ag) were taken
and the volume of each sample was equalized with the liver cytosol
extraction buffer. NADH was used at 200 Amol/L final concentrations to
serve as cofactor for the metabolic reaction and 500 Amol/L mitomycin C
final concentration was used for the assay. The sample tubes were
mixed gently and incubated in 37jC water bath. Absorbance at 554 nm
was recorded after 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min to measure the amount
of formation of mitomycin C metabolites especially 2,7-diaminomitosene.
The absorbance was also recorded at similar time intervals at 365 nm
to measure the disappearance of mitomycin C. The experiments were
repeated independently thrice. The fold increase in the amount of
formation of mitomycin C metabolites between BSA control, WT,
NQO1/, NQO1+/, and NQO2/ mice bone marrow cytosols was graphically depicted.

Results
The results of the various experiments are shown in Figs. 1 to 4.
Hematologic analysis revealed that exposure of WT, NQO1/,
NQO1+/, and NQO2/ mice to lower dose (1 mg/kg body weight)
of mitomycin C had no effect on RBC and hemoglobin content
(Fig. 1A and B). In addition, WT and NQO1/ mice did not

show morbidity (Fig. 1C). However, NQO2/ mice showed 10%
morbidity compared with WT and NQO1/ mice (Fig. 1C). In
contrast, the higher dose (2.5 mg/kg body weight) of mitomycin C
showed cytotoxicity in WT and NQO2/ but not in NQO1/
and NQO1+/ mice (Fig. 1). Hematologic analysis revealed >50%
decrease in RBCs and blood hemoglobin content and 70%
morbidity was observed in WT and NQO2/ mice exposed to
higher dose of mitomycin C compared with respective salinetreated control mice (P > 0.001; Fig. 1A–C). In similar experiments,
NQO1/ and NQO1+/ mice showed resistance to higher dose
of mitomycin C and did not show any significant reduction in
RBCs and hemoglobin content (Fig. 1A and B). In addition, the
morbidity was absent in NQO1/ mice, whereas only 30%
morbidity was observed with NQO1+/ mice exposed to higher
dose of mitomycin C (Fig. 1C). The morbidity in higher-dose
mitomycin C–exposed WT and NQO2/ mice was observed
between weeks 10 and 13 after first exposure. The WT and
NQO2/ mice showed slight difference in morbidity at weeks 11
and 12 after first exposure to mitomycin C (Fig. 1D). The NQO2/
mice were more sensitive than WT mice. In contrast, NQO1/
mice failed to show morbidity until 15 weeks and NQO1+/ mice
showed delayed morbidity that started at week 14 after first
exposure to mitomycin C.
Total WBC count increased in NQO1/, NQO1+/, and NQO2/
mice exposed to mitomycin C compared with unexposed mice
(Fig. 2A). The neutrophils showed mitomycin C dose-dependent
decline in WT and NQO2/ but not in NQO1/ and NQO1+/

Figure 2. Analysis of blood CBCs, BUN, and creatinine in mice untreated and treated with mitomycin C. WT, NQO1/, NQO1+ /, and NQO2/ mice were i.p. injected
with mitomycin C. Mice at week 15 of the study were analyzed for blood CBCs, BUN, and creatinine.

mice (Fig. 2B). Platelets showed mitomycin C–dependent decline
in all four types of mice (Fig. 2C). Blood levels of BUN and creatinine were normal in untreated and mitomycin C–treated mice
of different genotypes, indicating that kidneys were functioning
normal (Fig. 2D).
Histologic analysis of bone marrow, spleen, thymus, lymph
nodes, liver, lung, heart, and kidney was done. Except bone
marrow, none of the tissues analyzed showed lesions in
untreated and mitomycin C–treated WT, NQO1/, NQO1+/,
and NQO2/ mice. Histologic examination revealed that bone
marrow from all the four genetic background mice untreated
and treated with lower dose of mitomycin C was normal. No
lesions were detected. However, exposure of mice to high dose of
mitomycin C showed differential bone marrow response to
mitomycin C. The histology results on mice exposed to high
dose of mitomycin C are shown in Fig. 3. WT and NQO2/
mice showed bone marrow cytotoxicity, hypocellularity, and
significant increase in adipocytes in mitomycin C–treated mice

compared with untreated mice. Interestingly, NQO1-deficient
NQO1/ mice showed hypercellularity and resistance to
mitomycin C cytotoxicity (Fig. 3). NQO1+/ mice, in the same
experiment, showed only limited resistance to mitomycin
C–induced bone marrow toxicity (Fig. 3).
Western blot analysis showed presence of NQO1 protein in WT,
NQO2/, and NQO1+/ bone marrow but absence in NQO1/
mice (Fig. 4A). The amount of NQO1 protein in NQO1+/ mice was
significantly lower compared with WT mice because of the
presence of only one normal NQO1 allele. Similarly, NQO2 protein
was present in WT, NQO1/, and NQO1+/ mice but absent in
NQO2/ mice. There was no significant alteration in the levels
of NQO1 protein in NQO2/ and NQO2 protein in NQO1/ and
NQO1+/ mice compared with WT mice bone marrow. However, NQO2 protein was significantly lower than NQO1 protein in
bone marrow of WT mice. The NQO1 activity data supported the
NQO1 protein results from Western blot analysis (compare Fig. 4A
and B). The NQO1 activity in NQO2/ mice was more or less

similar as observed in NQO2/ mice and lower in NQO1+/ mice
(Fig. 4B). It is known that mitomycin C is metabolized by NQO1
to 2,7-diaminomitosene that has optimal absorption spectrum at
554 nm (18). The absorption maximum for mitomycin C is 365 nm
(18). Therefore, we analyzed the capacity of bone marrow lysates
from WT, NQO1/, NQO1+/, and NQO2/ mice to metabolize
mitomycin C to 2,7-diaminomitosene. We treated lysates from mice
bone marrow with mitomycin C for different time intervals and
measured the conversion of mitomycin C to 2,7-diaminomitosene
at 554 nm and disappearance of mitomycin C at 365 nm. The
results are shown in Fig. 4C and D. The bone marrow lysates from
WT and NQO2 / mice bone marrow showed significant
conversion of mitomycin C to 2,7-diaminomitosene compared
with NQO1/ mice. This was evident from rapid appearance of
2,7-diaminomitosene at 554 nm and disappearance of mitomycin C
at 365 nm with increasing time. Interestingly, the conversion of
mitomycin C to 2,7-diaminomitosene in case of NQO2/ was
slightly higher than WT mice. The NQO1+/ mice showed conversion of mitomycin C to 2,7-diaminomitosene that was halfway
between WT and NQO1/ mice.

Discussion
The results show that NQO1 is a major enzyme that catalyzes
metabolic activation of mitomycin C to 2,7-diaminomitosene that
causes bone marrow cytotoxicity, anemia, and morbidity in mice.
This was clearly evident from hypocellularity and significant
increase in bone marrow adipocytes and decrease in RBCs and
hemoglobin in WT and NQO2/ mice that contained substantial
NQO1 protein and activity. Seventy percent of these mice did not
survive during the study presumably because of anemia and related
complications. On the other hand, mice deficient in NQO1 were
resistant to mitomycin C–induced bone marrow toxicity. The
studies also showed that prime target organ for mitomycin C
toxicity is bone marrow, as histologic analysis of many other

tissues did not show lesions. The mitomycin C–induced bone
marrow toxicity was reported earlier (19). The mitomycin
C–induced decrease in neutrophils in WT and NQO2/ mice
presumably is also related to NQO1-mediated mitomycin
C–induced bone marrow toxicity. It is unknown if decrease in
neutrophils contributed to lower survival of WT and NQO2/
mice exposed to mitomycin C. The NQO1/ mice did not
show mitomycin C–induced decrease in neutrophils. The results
also showed that NQO2/ mice are slightly more susceptible to
mitomycin C than WT mice. This was evident from increased
morbidity and increased conversion of mitomycin C to 2,7-diaminomitosene. However, it remains unclear why NQO1 in NQO2/
mice bone marrow is slightly more active against mitomycin C
than NQO1 in WT mice.
The results from NQO1+/ mice also supported a role of NQO1 in
metabolic activation of mitomycin C and bone marrow toxicity.
NQO1+/ mice showed resistance to mitomycin C–induced bone
marrow toxicity and morbidity compared with WT and NQO2/
mice. However, the magnitude of resistance to mitomycin
C–induced bone marrow toxicity and morbidity was significantly
lower than NQO1/ mice. Interestingly, the RBC and hemoglobin
levels were more or less unaffected in mitomycin C–treated
NQO1+/ mice. This was same as observed with NQO1/ mice.
The NQO1 protein and activity and NQO1-mediated metabolism of
mitomycin C were reduced to half in NQO1+/ mice compared with
WT mice. These results also revealed that alterations in NQO1
protein and activity lead to similar alterations in mitomycin C
metabolic activation.
The observation of a major in vivo role of NQO1 in mitomycin
C–induced toxicity is important for bioreductive chemotherapy,
which is considered to be the most successful treatment for certain types of cancer cells (1–3). NQO1 is significantly overexpressed
in certain tumor tissues compared with normal tissues of similar
origin (14, 15). Therefore, effective dosage of drugs could be given
with drastic damage to tumor cells and more or less no toxicity

to normal cells. This was evident from observations that higher
doses (2.5 mg/kg body weight) of mitomycin C and not lower dose
(1 mg/kg body weight) were cytotoxic in the presence of NQO1.
Therefore, it is expected that higher concentration of NQO1 in
many tumors will activate mitomycin C to cause tumor cell death
and no toxicity in normal cells containing lower levels of NQO1. In
addition, the existence of hypoxic regions is a major problem in
radiation therapy, as oxygen is a radiation sensitizer. Therefore,
hypoxic parts of the tumors often survive radiation treatment and
may be center for a recurrent tumor. Bioreductive alkylating
agents, such as mitomycin C, may be more active in these hypoxic
regions of the tumors. The administration of such bioreductive
agents as adjuvant to radiation may be favorable for killing solid
tumor cells. The studies also suggest that mitomycin C therapy
might not be suitable for humans that carry a cytosine to
thymidine (C!T) polymorphism in exon 6 of human NQO1 gene,
which produces a proline to serine (P187S) substitution that
destabilizes and inactivates the enzyme (20). Human individuals
(2–4%) are homozygous and 22% to 25% individuals are
heterozygous for NQO1P187S mutant allele. Individuals carrying
both mutated genomic alleles are completely lacking in NQO1
activity, whereas individuals who are heterozygous with one
mutated allele have low to intermediate NQO1 activity compared
with WT individuals (20).
The cellular studies have shown a role of NQO2 in mitomycin C
activation and cytotoxicity (12). However, the current studies in
mice showed that NQO2 plays a minimal role in in vivo activation
of mitomycin C in bone marrow. This was evident from two

observations. First, NQO2/ mice showed slightly higher and not
lower susceptibility to mitomycin C compared with WT mice.
Second, the NQO2 is a weak metabolizer of mitomycin C to 2,7diaminomitosene, as very little of later product was observed with
NQO1/ bone marrow lysates. The reasons for the discrepancy
between cell and mouse models remain unknown. It is possibly
related to the lower levels of NQO2 compared with NQO1 in bone
marrow and/or lower concentration of NQO2 cofactor NRH in the
bone marrow. It is noteworthy that cellular studies on the role of
NQO2 in toxicity of mitomycin C used exogenously added cofactor
NRH (17).
In conclusion, the studies showed a major role of NQO1 in
in vivo metabolic activation and bone marrow cytotoxicity. The
results also showed that alterations in NQO1 protein and activity
cause similar alterations in metabolic activation of mitomycin C
and toxicity. The results further revealed that NQO2 plays a
minimal role in in vivo activation of mitomycin C in bone marrow.
These results are highly valuable in mitomycin C therapy and
development of mitomycin C–related and other chemotherapeutic
drugs.
