Abstract:
Type 2 endometrial carcinoma (EC) is a poorly differentiated EC. Unlike type
1 EC, which responds to hormonal treatment (progestins), type 2 EC is refractory
to hormonal treatment because of its low expression of active estrogen and
progesterone receptors (ER, PR). The aim of this study was to develop a novel drug
combination designed to treat these aggressive type 2 EC tumors without surgery and
with fertility potential preserved. We examined the effects of combined treatment
with the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) and the Ras inhibitor
S-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS; Salirasib). Because FTS can induce cell differentiation
in tumor cells, we examined whether FTS could induce re-differentiation of type 2 EC
cells, thereby sensitizing them to MPA. We found that FTS reduced Ras-GTP, phosphoAkt, and phospho-ERK, and that these reductions all correlated with a decrease in ERα
phosphorylation. Combined treatment with FTS and MPA induced stronger reduction
in USPC1 type 2 EC cell numbers than the reduction induced by either drug alone.
MPA caused ERα degradation. Death of the cells was caused by MPA but not by FTS.
The phosphorylated ERα induces gene transcription manifested by enhanced cell
proliferation and survival. The combination of FTS and MPA, by reducing the mRNA
expression of ERα-mediated genes (i.e. PR, c-fos and ps2/TFF1), inhibited tumor
growth and enhanced the death of type 2 EC cells. These promising results might
herald a novel treatment for the highly aggressive, incurable type 2 endometrial
carcinoma.

Introduction

is characterized by low-grade tumors that are related to
high estrogen levels resulting from unopposed estrogen
treatment, obesity [6], and history of tamoxifen use [7].
Type 1 is characterized by well-differentiated tumors,
expression of active estrogen and progesterone receptors
(ER, PR), and younger age of onset [4, 5]. Type 1 EC
can therefore be treated in various clinical situations
by progestational agents (synthetic progesterone, i.e.
progestins), such as Provera (medroxyprogesterone
acetate; MPA), which inhibit proliferation of endometrial
glandular epithelial cells [8, 9]. Complete response to the
treatment can lead to cure of the tumor without surgery
and with fertility potential preserved [10]. Type 2 EC
represents fewer than 10% of EC cases but accounts for

The endometrium undergoes cyclic regeneration
in response to ovarian steroid hormones. Proliferation of
endometrial cells is induced by estrogen and inhibited by
progesterone [1]. Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most
common gynecological cancer in the Western world. Each
year, EC develops in about 142,000 women worldwide,
with an estimated mortality of 29% [2]. Major symptoms
include dysfunctional uterine bleeding, hypermenorrhea,
irregular menstruation, and sterility [3]. Affected women
are usually postmenopausal, but 25% are premenopausal
and about 5% are younger than 40 [4, 5]. There are
two types of EC. Type 1 EC, the more common type,

Results

more than 50% of EC-related relapses and deaths [11].
Type 2 occurs at an older age, arises from endometrial
atrophy, and is not related to abnormal estrogen effects
on the endometrium. These tumors are characterized by
the absence or poor expression of active ERs and PRs
and by high-grade histology, and are often metastatic.
Thus the prognosis of type 2 EC is poor, and treatment is
based mainly on surgery followed by chemotherapy and
radiation [2].
Growth of the endometrium is induced by estrogen
and mediated through two nuclear receptors, ERα and
ERβ. Both types are transcription factors that control
gene expression, which is activated either in response to
ligand binding or in a ligand-independent manner [12, 13].
ERα and ERβ are products of separate genes located on
different chromosomes and are differently expressed in
various tissues [12, 14]. They also have opposite effects on
cell proliferation and apoptosis: whereas ERα leads to cell
proliferation [1, 12], ERβ modulates ERα transcriptional
activity [15] and its expression increases the proteolytic
degradation of ERα [16]. Progestins inhibit proliferation
of EC cells by acting as ERα antagonists. They inhibit
ERα action by decreasing ERα mRNA, repressing ERrelated transcription of genes involved in cell growth, and
activating the tumor-suppressor gene p21 [1, 3].
Among the several genetic alterations that appear
in EC is the K-Ras mutation which leads to constitutive
activation of the K-Ras protein. This mutation occur in up
to 30% of patients with type 1 EC and in 10% with type 2
EC [5, 17], and therefore Ras proteins are important targets
in anti-cancer research. Activation of Ras proteins (H, N,
K-Ras), which are small G-proteins, triggers a multitude of
signaling cascades such as the PI3K-Akt pathway, which
leads to cell survival, and the MAPK/ERK pathway, which
leads to cell proliferation [18]. S-farnesylthiosalicylic
acid (FTS; Salirasib) [19, 20] is a nontoxic inhibitor
of all active forms of Ras proteins. Designed to mimic
the farnesyl cysteine moiety of the C-terminus of Ras,
it displaces active Ras from the plasma membrane and
targets it for degradation [21]. FTS has been intensively
studied in many types of human tumor cell lines both in
vitro and in vivo [20, 22, 23] and was shown to induce
autophagy in human cancer cell lines [24]. It can synergize
with other anti-cancer drugs such as gemcitabine [25],
2-deoxyglucose [26], and proteasome inhibitors [27]. FTS
was also shown to induce differentiation of malignant cells
such as thyroid cancer cells [28] and NF1-deficient cells
[29].
We aimed to develop a novel drug treatment for the
aggressive type 2 EC tumors. To this end we examined the
effects of combined treatment with the progestin MPA and
the Ras inhibitor FTS on the growth of type 1 and type 2
EC cells (ECC1 and USPC1 cells, respectively). We tested
the hypothesis that these poorly differentiated EC tumors
would respond to hormonal treatment if FTS could induce
their differentiation.

FTS downregulates active Ras-GTP and its
downstream signaling, leading to inhibition of
proliferation of ECC1 and USPC1 cells
As shown in Figure 1a, we found a dose-dependent
decrease in the number of viable ECC1 or USPC1 cells
as a function of FTS concentration. FTS reduced the
number of cells with a half-maximal (50%) inhibitory
concentration (IC50) of 50.4 µM for ECC1 cells and
51.7 µM for USPC1 cells. Figure 1b shows typical
immunoblots of Ras, Ras-GTP (active Ras), pERK, ERK,
pAkt, Akt, and β-tubulin (loading control) prepared from
lysates of ECC1 and USPC1 cells treated with 0.1%
DMSO (control) or 50 µM FTS. The results of statistical
analyses of these experiments are shown in Figures 1c
and 1d for ECC1 and USPC1 cells, respectively. FTS
treatment resulted in a significant decrease (expressed as
a percentage of control cells) in Ras-GTP (ECC1: 47.4
± 0.6%, n = 6, p < 0.001; USPC1: 56.3 ± 0.6%, n = 6,
p < 0.001), pAkt (ECC1: 63.8 ± 0.3%, p = 0.009, n = 6;
USPC1: 45.3 ± 8.2%, p = 0.01, n = 6), and pERK (ECC1:
65.3 ± 4.7%, p = 0.04, n = 6; USPC1: 59.5 ± 1.2%, p
= 0.002, n = 6) (see Figs. 1c and 1d). There were no
significant differences between the numbers of control
and FTS-treated cells in lysates of total Ras, total ERK,
total Akt, or β-tubulin. These results indicate that in both
cell lines, active Ras and its downstream signaling were
inhibited by FTS [19, 22].

Combined treatment with FTS + MPA inhibits
USPC1 cell proliferation
We examined the effects of FTS, MPA, and FTS
+MPA on the proliferation of ECC1 and USPC1 cells
(Figs. 2a and 2b). Results were calculated as percentages
of control. Number of ECC1 cells were reduced to 80.1
± 3.8% by treatment with FTS (n = 6, p < 0.001), to 37.8
± 0.9% by treatment with MPA (n = 6, p < 0.001), and
to 28.6 ± 10.5% by the combined treatment (n = 6, p <
0.001). The numbers of USPC1 cells were reduced to
63.9 ± 3.6% by FTS (n = 6, p = 0.04), to 68.4 ± 5.8%
(n = 6, p = 0.04) by MPA, and to 14.2 ± 6.9% by their
combination (n = 6, p < 0.001). The finding that ECC1
cells were affected by MPA alone was expected, as these
well-differentiated cells express active PRs and ERs [33].
The poorly differentiated USPC1 cells responded weakly
to MPA alone, but were strongly affected by the combined
treatment with MPA and FTS (Fig. 2b). These results
indicated that FTS increases the sensitivity of USPC1 cells
to MPA.

annexin V only); and the upper right part shows the counts
of the double-stained necrotic cells. Relative to the control
cells, there was no significant increase in apoptosis after
treatment with FTS alone (apoptotic cells in the control
amounted to 1.2 ± 0.3% of the total number (n = 6), and
1.4 ± 0.5% of the total number in the FTS-treated cells (p =
0.37, n = 6). Treatment with MPA resulted in a significant
increase in apoptosis compared to that in the control (3.9
± 0.8% of total MPA-treated cells; p = 0.01, n = 6), while
in cells treated with the FTS + MPA combination 5.1 ±
1.6% of the total number were apoptotic (p = 0.02, n =
6). There were no significant differences in the numbers
of necrotic cells seen after the different treatments (see
Fig. 2d). These results indicated that FTS does not induce
apoptosis but reduce cell numbers by inhibiting Ras and
its signaling, which in turn inhibited proliferation (Fig.

Next we examined the nature of the reductions in
ECC1 and USPC1 cell numbers observed after treatment
with MPA, FTS, or their combination. To investigate the
possible role of apoptosis or necrosis or both, we stained
the cells with annexin-V (which stains apoptotic cells) or
double-stained them with PI and annexin (which stains
necrotic cells) (see Methods), and then analyzed the
stained cells by FACS cytometry. Figure 2c presents the
results obtained for the USPC1 cells; the results obtained
for the ECC1 cells were similar (not shown). Data
obtained for the control and after treatments with FTS,
MPA, and FTS + MPA are shown as indicated in the four

of the MAPK/ERK pathway enhances phosphorylation of
ERα Ser118. Activation by phosphorylation of the Akt
pathway leads to phosphorylation of ERαSer167 [34].
Both of these pathways are regulated by Ras.
To determine the amount and localization of ERα
and its phosphorylated forms we treated ECC1 and
USPC1 cells with FTS, MPA, FTS + MPA, or 0.1%
DMSO (control) and assayed them in immunofluorescence
experiments using anti-ERα, anti-pERα Ser118, and antipERα Ser167 antibodies. Hoechst staining was used to
check nuclear localization. Figures 3a, 3c and 3e show
typical results of staining of USPC1 cells with ERα, pERα

activation function 1 region of the N-terminal domain of
ERα [34]. These phosphorylations result in enhanced ERmediated transcription [34]. Activation by phosphorylation

FIGURE 2: Effects of FTS and MPA on ECC1 and USPC1 cell viability. (a) Combined treatment with FTS + MPA inhibits

proliferation of ECC1 and USPC1 cells. ECC1 and USPC1 cells were plated in 24-well plates and treated after 24 hr with FTS (6 µM),
MPA (10 nM), FTS (6 µM) + MPA (10 nM), or 0.1% DMSO (control). After 6 days cells were counted. (a) ECC1 cells showed the expected
response of type 1 EC cells to MPA treatment, i.e., a decrease in their numbers that was significantly greater than the decrease obtained by
treatment with FTS. The effect of treatment with FTS + MPA, again as expected, did not differ from the effect of MPA alone. (b) USPC1
shows the expected weak response of type 2 EC cells to MPA treatment. In combination with FTS, however, MPA caused a significant
decrease in USPC1 cell proliferation. (c and d) MPA, but not FTS, induces apoptosis in USPC1 cells. For cell death evaluation, ECC1 and
USPC1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates, treated for 5 days with FTS, MPA, or FTS + MPA (concentrations as above), and then collected
and assayed by double staining with annexin-V-PI. Apoptosis and necrosis were determined respectively by staining with annexin-V or by
double-staining with annexin-V-PI (see Methods), and analysed by FACS. (c) Results for control, FTS-treated, MPA-treated and FTS +

however, apoptosis was significantly increased in cells treated with MPA or with FTS + MPA. There were no significant differences in
treatment-related effects on necrosis,. These results indicated that FTS does not induce apoptosis but rather inhibits cell proliferation,
whereas MPA induces apoptotic cell death. Results are presented as means ± SEM, n = 6. *, ** and *** are compared with the control for

four treatments. The results confirmed that the receptor,
as already known [35], is localized mainly in the nucleus.
Statistical analyses of the mean fluorescence intensities
of ERα, pERα Ser118 and pERα Ser167, expressed as
percentages of control in ECC1 and in USPC1 cells, are
presented in Figures 3b, 3d and 3f, respectively. ERα in
ECC1 cells showed no change after FTS treatment (p =
0.24), but was strongly downregulated by FTS in USPC1
cells (44.8 ± 0.23%, p << 0.0001, n = 100). Treatment with
MPA caused a decrease in ERα in both cell lines (ECC1:
76.2 ± 2.5%, p << 0.0001, n = 100; USPC1: 75.2 ± 2.8%,
p << 0.0001, n = 100). ERα was also reduced in both
cell lines by treatment with the FTS + MPA combination
(ECC1: 50.4 ± 1.5%, p << 0.0001, n = 100; USPC: 47.6 ±
1.2%, p << 0.0001, n = 100).
Next we examined the intensities of pERα Ser118
and pERα Ser167 in ECC1 and USPC1 cells under the
different treatments. pERα Ser118 and pERα Ser167 both
showed nuclear labeling by their relevant antibodies (Figs.
3c and 3e). FTS, but not MPA, strongly reduced pERα
Ser118 phosphorylation in both ECC1 (60.1 ± 0.6%, p <<
0.0001, n = 100) and USPC1 cells (58.4 ± 0.7%, p <<
0.0001, n = 100, Fig. 3d). The combined treatment did
not improve the FTS effects (91.3 ± 1.3%, p = 0.1, n =
100 in ECC1; 80.6 ± 1.1%, p = 0.01, n = 100 in USPC1
cells). Similar results were obtained for pERαSer167:
FTS treatment reduced pERαSer167 in both ECC1 (76.6
± 0.4%, p << 0.0001, n = 100) and USPC1 cells (70.8 ±
0.2%, p << 0.0001, n = 100), MPA had no effect (p = 0.45,
n = 100 in ECC1; p = 0.29, n = 100 in USPC1 cells), and
FTS + MPA reduced it to 71.9 ± 0.6% (p << 0.0001, n =
100) in ECC1 cells and to 67.7 ± 0.2% (p << 0.0001, n =
100) in USPC1 cells. Altogether, these results suggested
that FTS, but not MPA, inhibits ERα phosphorylation
in both ECC1 and USPC1 cells. This finding correlates
with the observed FTS-induced reduction in pERK and
pAkt (Fig. 1b), and supports the conclusion that once the
phosphorylation levels are decreased, activation of ERα is
also decreased [12].

MPA increases ERα degradation in ECC1 and in
USPC1 cells
Next we examined whether the decrease in ERα was
related to an increase in the receptor’s degradation. We
treated ECC1 and USPC1 cells for 5 days with DMSO
(control), FTS, MPA or FTS + MPA, and then treated them
with CHX (50 µg/ml) to inhibit protein synthesis. At 0, 6,
24 and 32 hr after addition of CHX the cells were lysed for
western blot analysis with anti-ERα antibody. Figures 4a
and 4b depict ERα expression levels in ECC1 and USPC1
cells, respectively, following each of the treatments, at time
zero and at 6, 24, and 32 hr after CHX addition (β-tubulin
was used as a loading control). A reduction in receptor
levels was already observed by 6 hr after CHX addition
320

and increased with time. This finding led us to choose 32
hr post CHX treatment as the time point for comparison of
ERα expression levels in the different treatments. Figures
4c and 4d show the relative expression levels of ERα in
ECC1 and USPC1 cells, respectively, at 32 hr, presented
as a percentage of the expression at time zero, for each
of the treatments. In the absence of drugs (control), ERα
was reduced to 36.3 ± 4.7% (p < 0.001, n = 4) in ECC1
and to 46.3 ± 7.6% (p < 0.001, n = 4) in USPC1 cells.
After FTS treatment the receptor was reduced to 34.6 ±
2.2% (p < 0.001, n = 4) in ECC1 and to 53.4 ± 5.4% (p <
0.001, n = 4) in USPC1 cells. MPA treatment reduced the
receptor to 24.0 ± 2.7% (p < 0.001, n = 4) in ECC1 and to
22.4 ± 5.1% (p < 0.001, n = 4) in USPC1 cells. Treatment
with the FTS + MPA combination reduced ERα to 16.1 ±
2.6% (p < 0.001, n = 4) in ECC1 and to 24.5 ± 6.4% (p <

a

0.001, n = 4) in USPC1 cells. At 32 hr post CHX addition,
comparison of expression levels of ERα for the different
treatments with its expression level in the control showed
that there was no significant difference in ERα degradation
with FTS treatment in ECC1 cells (p = 0.386, n = 4) or in
USPC1 cells (p = 0.238, n = 4), whereas MPA increased
the receptor’s degradation both in ECC1 (p = 0.03, n =
4) and in USPC1 cells (p = 0.02, n = 4). FTS + MPA also
increased protein degradation in both ECC1 (p = 0.004,
n= 4) and USPC1 cells (p = 0.03, n = 4). These results
indicated that ERα degradation is enhanced by MPA but
not by FTS.
Together with the findings (Fig. 2d) that MPA
increases apoptotic cell death, these results show that the
presence of ERα protein in EC cells protects them from
apoptosis.

FIGURE 4: MPA increases ERα degradation in ECC1 and USPC1 cell lines. ECC1 and USPC1 cells were plated in 6-well

plates, and after 24 hr they were treated with FTS, MPA, FTS + MPA (concentrations as in Fig. 2), or 0.1% DMSO (control) (four wells per
treatment). After 5 days, one well from each treatment was lysed (time zero) and the other three wells were treated with CHX (50 µg/ml).
At 6, 24, or 32 hr after CHX addition the cells were lysed and subjected to western blot analysis with anti-ERα antibody. β-tubulin was used
as loading control. Results of a typical experiment are presented, showing ERα and β-tubulin expression levels (a) in ECC1 cells and (b)
in USPC1 cells. The blot was loaded with samples of control, FTS-treated, MPA-treated, and FTS + MPA-treated cells taken at time zero
and at 6, 24 and 32 hr after addition of CHX. (c) Statistical analysis of ERα after treatment with CHX for 32 hr, presented as percentages of

as percentages of the relevant control value (taken as
100%). In ECC1 cells treated with FTS, ERα mRNA was
decreased to 78.8 ± 7.3% (p = 0.01, n = 6). In ECC1 cells
treated with MPA, ERα mRNA was decreased to 66.0 ±

(p < 0.0001, n = 6). ERβ mRNA in the FTS-treated ECC1
cells was unchanged (p = 0.4, n = 6). Treatment with MPA
alone yielded a significant increase in ERβ mRNA (165.1
± 9.2% (p = 0.002, n = 6), and treatment of these cells
with FTS + MPA yielded an even larger increase of 204.4

no significant difference either in ERα mRNA or in ERβ
mRNA when the cells were treated with FTS alone and

Next we wanted to find out whether the reduction
in ERα expression by MPA + FTS is related to a decrease
in ERα mRNA and whether ERβ plays a role in the

FIGURE 5: Combined treatment (FTS + MPA) decreases ERα mRNA and increases ERβ mRNA, leading to decreased
ERα-mediated transcription in ECC1 and USPC1 cells. ECC1 and USPC1 cells were plated in 10-cm plates and treated 24 hr

later with FTS, MPA, FTS + MPA (concentrations as in Fig. 2) or 0.1% DMSO (control). After 6 days of treatment we assayed the mRNA
of ERα, ERβ, progesterone receptors A+B (PR A+B), ps2/TFF1 and c-fos in both cell types, using real-time PCR. GAPDH was used as a
housekeeping gene. The mRNA level of each gene is presented as a percentage of its level in the control. (a) In ECC1 cells, ERα mRNA was
reduced by treatment with FTS, MPA, or FTS + MPA. ERβ mRNA was increased by treatment with MPA and FTS + MPA. (b) In USPC1
cells, no change was induced by FTS or MPA treatment alone. With FTS + MPA, however, ERα mRNA was decreased and ERβ mRNA
was increased. ERβ is known to modulate ERα transcriptional activity and its expression increases the degradation of ERα. Thus, these
results showed that treatment with FTS + MPA causes USPC1 cells to respond to MPA by acting like ECC1 cells. (c) In ECC1 cells, PR
A+B mRNA was decreased by all three treatments; ps2/TFF1 mRNA was decreased only by FTS + MPA, and c-fos mRNA was decreased
by MPA and by FTS + MPA. (d) In USPC1 cells, a significant decrease in c-fos mRNA and ps2/TFF1 mRNA was observed only with FTS
+ MPA treatment. PR A+B mRNA in these cells was decreased by all three treatments, similar to the findings in ECC1 cells. The decrease
in transcription of ERα-mediated genes as result of treatment with FTS + MPA showed that the combined treatment decreases the activity
of ERα. Results are shown as means ± SEM (n = 6 for (a) and (b); n = 4 for (c) and (d)). *, **,and *** are compared with the relevant

with MPA alone (p = 0.36 and p = 0.20, respectively, for
ERα mRNA, n = 6; and p = 0.24, p = 0.30, respectively,
for ERβ mRNA, n = 6). With the combined treatment
(FTS + MPA), however, the difference was significant:
ERα mRNA dropped to 90.2 ± 4.3% (p = 0.02, n = 6)
whereas ERβ mRNA rose to 137.9 ± 10.2% (p = 0.004,
n = 6).
These results can explain the difference in the action
of MPA on type 1 and type 2 EC cells. In ECC1 cells (type
1 EC), MPA increased ERβ mRNA and decreased ERα
mRNA. This phenomenon was enhanced when the cells
were treated with FTS + MPA (Fig. 5a). These findings
are consistent with the known role of ERβ as a regulator
of ERα, which by itself causes cell proliferation [15, 16].
The results also reflect the known sensitivity of ECC1
cells to progestins. Downregulation of ERα transcription
and upregulation of transcription of ERβ may explain the
observed reduction in proliferation of FTS-treated and
MPA-treated cells. In USPC1 cells (type 2 EC), which

are not sensitive to progestins [2] (Fig. 5b), it was only
the combined treatment of FTS + MPA that induced a
decrease in mRNA of ERα and an increase in mRNA of
ERβ. Thus, in the presence of FTS, the response of USPC1
cells to MPA was similar to that of MPA alone treated
ECC1 cells (Figs. 5a and 5b). These results indicated that
FTS converts type 2 EC cells to “type1-like” EC cells,
which respond to progestins.

Combined treatment with FTS and MPA
decreases ERα-mediated gene transcription in
ECC1 and USPC1 cells
Next we examined whether the FTS-induced
decrease in ERα phosphorylation leads to downregulation
of gene transcription. Studies have shown that
transcription of the PR A+B [36], ps2/TFF1 [37, 38], and
c-fos [39-41] is induced by estrogen. c-fos is activated as

Survival & Proliferation
FIGURE 6: Proposed mechanism of the combined action of FTS + MPA on EC cells. Estrogens play an important role in

the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, and function of the endometrium. They mediate their biological effects through two
estrogen receptors in the nucleus, namely ERα and ERβ. ERs are transcription factors that are activated by phosphorylation and control
gene expression. The activation is induced either in response to ligand binding or independently of ligand. Ras becomes active in the RasGTP form, which is upregulated by extracellular signals such as growth factors and hormones that bind the tyrosine kinase receptor. Once
activated, Ras-GTP signals to multiple effector pathways that regulate proliferation, survival, metabolism, migration and shape of the cell.
One of these pathways causes phosphorylation of Akt, which leads to cell survival, and another causes phosphorylation of ERK, leading
to cell proliferation. Nuclear ERα is phosphorylated by pAkt at Ser167 and by pERK at Ser-118. Once phosphorylated, ERα is activated
to target the transcription of genes (such as c-fos, ps2/TFF1, and PR A+B), leading to cell survival and proliferation. MPA increases
ERα degradation, thereby reducing ERα in the cell (both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm). FTS inhibits active Ras-GTP, leading to a
decrease in pAkt and pERK, and hence a decrease in pERαSer118 and in pERαSer167, and finally a decrease in ERα gene transcription.
These results showed that the combination of MPA + FTS inhibits proliferation of endometrial cells. ERα, estrogen receptor alpha; FTS,

5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) [44] or metformin
[45] were found to be effective against EC cells by
enhancing the anti-proliferative effect of MPA. Moreover,
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (such
as leuprolide acetate) in combination with Mirena, a
levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine delivery system, were
shown to be effective in clinical studies [46, 47].
In this study we examined the effect of treatment
with a combination of the Ras inhibitor FTS and the
progestin MPA on proliferation and death of both the
well-differentiated ECC1 type 1 EC cells and the poorly
differentiated USPC1 type 2 EC cells. Our results show
that FTS increased the antiproliferative effects of MPA
on type 2 EC, which otherwise responds poorly to MPA
(Fig. 2b). Figure 6 summarizes the proposed mechanism
of the combined FTS + MPA treatment of EC cells. MPA
induces degradation of ERα in both ECC1 and USPC1
cells, as observed in this study also with the combined
drug treatment (Fig. 4 and Fig. 6). Thus, treatment with
this progestin leads to a reduction in total ERα in the
nucleus of USPC1 cells (Figs. 3a and 3b). MPA also
caused apoptotic cell death (Fig. 2b). Taken together, these
results suggest that ERα protects EC cells from apoptosis,
as also shown previously in EC cells [48], in breast
cancer cells [49] as well as pancreatic beta cells [50]. FTS
inhibits proliferation of ECC1 and USPC1 cells (Fig. 1a)
by downregulating active Ras-GTP and its downstream
signaling pathways (Fig. 1b and Fig. 6). These signaling
pathways are critical for ERα phosphorylation, which
leads to ligand-independent gene transcription [12, 34].
These genes play critical roles in cell proliferation and
death [13]. Two ERα sites that are phosphorylated by these
pathways are Ser118 (activated by pERK) and Ser167
(activated by pAkt) [34]. We showed that Ras inhibition
decreases phosphorylation of ERα in the nucleus (Fig. 3
and Fig. 6). In addition, combined treatment with FTS
+ MPA decreases the transcription of important ERαregulated genes both in ECC1 and in USPC1 cells (Figs.
5c, 5d and Fig. 6), manifested by a decrease in ERα
mRNA expression and an increase in mRNA expression
of ERβ, known to inhibit ERα and cell growth [12] (Fig.
5a and 5b). Thus, treatment of USPC1 type 2 EC cells
with FTS + MPA leads to lower ERα mRNA and higher
ERβ mRNA expression, as seen in type 1 EC cells that
respond well to MPA.
There are several cellular mechanisms of ER
activation that lead to gene transcription. In the classical
mechanism ER is activated by ligand binding, and in the
nonclassical mechanism by ERK and Akt phosphorylations
[12]. MPA reduced ligand-dependent ER activity, thereby
antagonizing ERα and increasing its degradation, while
FTS reduced ligand-independent ER activity by reducing
ERα phosphorylation. It was only once these two ERactivation mechanisms were downregulated that we
observed a decrease in the transcription of ER-mediated
genes in USPC1 cells (Fig. 6).

pathways. [13, 42] We therefore performed real-time PCR
assays using primers for PR, ps2/TFF1, and c-fos genes.
In ECC1 cells we found no significant differences in ps2/
TFF1 mRNA between cells treated with FTS alone and
with MPA alone (p = 0.34, p = 0.18, n = 4, respectively),
whereas a significant decrease (in all cases relative to
control (taken as 100%) to 81.8 ± 4.1% was obtained
with treatment by FTS + MPA (p = 0.02, n = 4) (Fig. 5c).
Expression of c-fos mRNA was unchanged by treatment
with FTS alone (p = 0.44, n = 4), but was reduced to 80.3 ±
2.9% with MPA alone (p = 0.04, n = 4) and to 72.5 ± 6.9%
(p = 0.02, n = 4) with FTS + MPA (Fig. 5c). Expression
of PR A+B mRNA was reduced in all treatment groups:
it was reduced to 58.5 ± 9.2% (p = 0.002, n = 4) in the
FTS-treated cells, to 58.8 ± 13.5% (p = 0.01, n=4) in the
MPA-treated cells and to 54.8 ± 13.5% (p = 0.008, n = 4)
in the FTS + MPA-treated cells (Fig. 5c). In USPC1 cells
there were no significant differences in ps2/TFF1 mRNA
between the control and the cells treated with FTS alone
or with MPA alone (p = 0.27, p = 0.25, n = 4, respectively)
(Fig. 5d). The same was found with respect to c-fos mRNA
(p = 0.38, p = 0.47, n = 4, respectively) (Fig. 5d). With
the combined FTS + MPA treatment, however, significant
differences were observed: ps2/TFF1 mRNA decreased to
71.1 ± 8.3 (p = 0.04, n = 4) and c-fos mRNA decreased
to 76.3 ± 4.6% (p = 0.04, n=4). Expression of PR mRNA
was reduced in all three treatment groups: to 75.7 ± 3.9%
with FTS (p = 0.006, n = 4), to 72.8 ± 6.5% with MPA (p
= 0.008, n = 4), and to 85.3 ± 3.2% with FTS + MPA (p =
0.04, n = 4) (Fig. 5d). The observed differences in mRNA
expression between the genes point to the likelihood of
different mechanisms driving their transcription. The
reduction in mRNA expression of c-fos correlates with the
observed reduction in active Ras pathways by FTS (Fig.
1b). The reduced transcription of three ER-regulated genes
in both ECC1 and USPC1 cells observed with FTS + MPA
strongly suggested that the combined treatment reduces
not only the mRNA and protein expression of ERα but
also ERα activity.

Discussion
Progestin therapy is known to be an effective
treatment for patients with well-differentiated EC [8, 9].
It offers an optional treatment for poor surgical candidates
and for patients who wish to preserve fertility. Progestins
antagonize ERα, leading to inhibition of tumor growth.
Treatment efficacy declines with the severity and the dedifferentiation stage of the tumor [1]. Therefore, increasing
research efforts are being made to sensitize high-grade EC
to progestins. The beneficial effects of combined treatment
with different drugs designed to treat EC can be enhanced
by targeting different pathways of oncogenic signaling.
One such approach is based on the combination of
progestins with chemotherapy or with molecular-targeted
therapies [43]. For example, combinations of MPA and

Immunoblot analysis

We conclude that MPA antagonizes the
unphosphorylated ERα. Once ERα phosphorylation is
reduced by FTS, the EC cells become more sensitive to
the antiproliferative effect of MPA. This is reminiscent
of the observed enhanced sensitivity of EC cells to MPA
when the latter is combined with the DNA demethylating
agent 5-aza-CdR [44]. However unlike 5-aza-CdR [51],
FTS is a non-toxic drug. Here we show that when the
phosphorylation of ERα is decreased and ERβ mRNA is
increased by FTS, USPC1 cells respond better to MPA.
In conclusion, MPA in combination with FTS leads
to enhanced apoptotic death of EC cells. This can be used
as new method to inhibit type 2 endometrial carcinoma.

ECC1 and USPC1 cells were each plated at a
density of 5×105 cells per 10-cm plate, and treated 24 h
later with FTS (50 µM) or 0.1% DMSO (control). After
3 days cells were lysed as described [31]. The lysates (75
µg protein) were immunoblotted with mouse anti-pan-Ras
Ab (1:2,500, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), rabbit antiAkt Ab (1:1,000), rabbit anti-phospho-Akt (anti-pAkt)
Ab (1:1,000), mouse anti-phospho-ERK (anti-pERK) Ab
(1:10,000, Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-ERK Ab (1:1,000)
and, as a loading control, rabbit anti-β-tubulin Ab (1:500,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Ras-GTP
was assayed in lysates by GST-RBD pull-down assay as
described previously [31]. Immunoblots were exposed
to the appropriate secondary peroxidase-coupled IgG
(1:2,500, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West
Grove, PA) and subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Protein
bands were quantified by densitometry with Image
EZQuant-Gel statistical analysis software.

Material and methods
Cell culture and reagents
The endometrial carcinoma type 1 (ECC1) cell
line was provided by Dr. Haim Werner, Human Genetics
Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University. The uterine
serous papillary carcinoma-1 type 2 (USPC1) cell line
was provided by Dr. Santin Alessandro, Yale University
and sequenced by him [30]. ECC1 and USPC1 cells
were maintained in DMEM and RPMI-1640 medium,
respectively (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit HaEmek, Israel) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(FCS) (or with 5% FCS for experiments), 100 units/
ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.05 mg/ml
gentamicin sulphate, and 25 ng/ml amphotericin B. All
reagents were purchased from Biological Industries.
Cells were incubated at 37oC in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere of 95% air / 5% CO2. FTS was kindly donated
by Concordia Pharmaceuticals (Fort Lauderdale, FL).
Cycloheximide (CHX) and MPA were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Rehovot, Israel).

Cyclohexamide assay for translation arrest
ECC1 and USPC1 cells were each plated in 6-well
plates at a density of 2×105 cells per well. After 24 hours
the cells were treated with FTS, MPA, FTS + MPA or, as a
control, DMSO (concentrations as above; 4 wells for each
treatment). After 5 days one well from each treatment was
lysed (time zero) and the rest of the wells were treated
with CHX (50 µg/ml). At 6, 24, and 32 hr after CHX
addition, cells were lysed for western blot analysis with
mouse anti-ERα Ab (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Rabbit anti-β-tubulin Ab (1:1000) served as a loading
control. Each experiment was carried out in duplicate and
performed four times. Protein bands were quantified as
described above.

Proliferation and cell survival assay

Fluorescence-activated cell-sorter (FACS) analysis

For the FTS dose-response experiment we plated
ECC1 cells (1.5 × 103 cells per well) and USPC1 cells (4.5
× 103 cells per well) in 24-well plates. After 24 h the cells
were treated with FTS at different concentrations (in µM:
100, 75, 50, 25, 12, 6) or, as a control, with 0.1% dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). Cells were counted after 4 days.
To measure cell survival after treatment with FTS,
MPA, or their combination (FTS + MPA), we plated ECC1
and USPC1 cells in 24-well plates as described above.
After 24 h, the cells were treated with FTS (6 µM), MPA
(10 nM), FTS + MPA (6 and 10 nM, respectively), or 0.1%
DMSO (control). After 6 days cells were counted.

To quantify cell death, we seeded ECC1 and
USPC1 cells in 6-well plates at a density of 2×105 cells
per well and treated them 24 h later with FTS, MPA,
FTS + MPA, or, as a control, DMSO, at the above
mentioned concentrations. After 5 days the cells were
collected and assayed by double staining with annexinV-phosphatidylinositide (PI) (IQ Products, Groningen,
The Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The results obtained by FACSCalibur flow
cytometry were analyzed with FlowJo Software (Ashland,
OR). All experiments were carried out in duplicate and
performed three times.

days of treatment total RNA was isolated from the
cells using the PerfectPure RNA Cultured Cell Kit
(5 PRIME). Purified RNA was subjected to real-time
PCR as described [32]. The primers used to target the
ERα gene were 5’-CCACCAACCAGTGCACCATT-3’
