Abstract

Author Manuscript

The Notch ligand DLL3 has emerged as a novel therapeutic target expressed in small cell lung
cancer (SCLC) and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. Rovalpituzumab teserine (Rova-T™;
SC16LD6.5) is a first-in-class DLL3-targeted antibody-drug conjugate with encouraging initial
safety and efficacy profiles in SCLC in the clinic. Here we demonstrate that tumor expression of
DLL3, though orders of magnitude lower in surface protein expression than typical oncology
targets of immunoPET, can serve as an imaging biomarker for SCLC. We developed 89Zr-labeled
SC16 antibody as a companion diagnostic agent to facilitate selection of patients for treatment
with Rova-T based on a non-invasive interrogation of the in vivo status of DLL3 expression using
PET imaging. Despite low cell-surface abundance of DLL3, immunoPET imaging with 89Zrlabeled SC16 antibody enabled delineation of subcutaneous and orthotopic SCLC tumor

xenografts as well as distant organ metastases with high sensitivity. Uptake of the radiotracer in
tumors was concordant with levels of DLL3 expression and, most notably, DLL3 immunoPET
yielded rank-order correlation for response to SC16LD6.5 therapy in SCLC patient-derived
xenograft models.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an extremely lethal form of lung cancer that accounts for
16% of all lung cancer cases diagnosed annually in the United States (1, 2). The majority of
SCLC cases are metastatic at the time of diagnosis, necessitating effective systemic therapies
(3). The standard of care for extensive stage SCLC consists of a combination of the
cytotoxic agents cisplatin or carboplatin with etoposide (4). While patients respond to these
therapies, they often relapse shortly after the cessation of treatment, accounting in part for a
dismal 5-year survival rate of 2% (5). These outcomes have not meaningfully improved in
more than 3 decades (6). There are no FDA-approved targeted therapies for SCLC, and no
approved therapies of any kind beyond topotecan in the second line. There is a desperate
need for novel systemic therapies as well as diagnostic approaches to direct these therapies
to the patients most likely to benefit from them.

Author Manuscript

We recently reported that delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) is a highly tumor-selective cell surface
protein expressed in high-grade neuroendocrine lung tumors including SCLC (7). DLL3 is
an inhibitory ligand of the Notch signaling pathway that is normally expressed exclusively
on intracellular membranes, including those of the Golgi apparatus (8). However, marked
induction of DLL3 expression in SCLC results in localization to the cell surface: this
together with the absence of detectable cell surface DLL3 in non-malignant cells opens a
new window of opportunity for tumor-cell specific therapy. Of particular relevance to SCLC,
DLL3 is implicated in the regulation of clonogenic and tumorigenic capacity (7).
Exceptionally high clonogenic capacity, early metastatic spread, and rapid tumor
repopulation after exposure to chemotherapy are hallmark features of SCLC (9).

Author Manuscript

Rovalpituzumab teserine (Rova-T; SC16LD6.5) is a DLL3-targeted antibody-drug conjugate
(ADC) comprising a humanized anti-DLL3 monoclonal antibody [rovalpituzumab (SC16)],
a cleavable dipeptide linker, and a cell cycle-independent pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD;
D6.5) toxin (7, 10). SC16LD6.5 was reported to selectively target DLL3-expressing cells
compared to an isotype-matched control antibody formulation. Treatment with the DLL3targeted ADC completely and durably eradicated SCLC patient-derived xenografts (PDX)
expressing high levels of DLL3 in a variety of preclinical models including those resistant to
cisplatin and etoposide. Furthermore, a recently completed first-in-human phase I trial of
Rova-T in patients with relapsed SCLC demonstrated encouraging clinical outcomes (11).
Among the 67% of patients with > 50% of cells expressing DLL3 (DLL3Hi), a confirmed
objective response rate of 39% and confirmed disease control rate of 89% were observed

(11). Importantly, all patients with confirmed objective responses by investigator assessment
were DLL3Hi by immunohistochemistry (IHC). This early clinical experience highlights the
significance of DLL3 assessment as a predictive biomarker for DLL3-targeted agents.

Author Manuscript

Despite these encouraging early clinical results, IHC suffers from several limitations that
may reduce its effectiveness as a clinical diagnostic for DLL3-targeted therapies. These
limitations include (a) the lack of contemporaneous tissue biopsy, an especially acute
problem in aggressive carcinomas like SCLC, where multiple biopsies are rarely performed;
(b) the sampling bias caused by intratumoral heterogeneity or heterogeneity between the
primary tumor and metastases; and (c) the inherently high false-negative rate of
histopathological assessment. Such limitations have led to the recent emergence and
application of immuno-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) as a more reliable
approach for the noninvasive evaluation of tumor-associated antigen expression in vivo (12).
ImmunoPET may reflect physiologic drug binding more accurately than IHC of tumor
sections ex vivo due to factors such as high intratumoral oncotic and hydrostatic pressures
and variable perfusion that can limit delivery of antibody-based therapeutics. An increasing
number of immunoPET strategies are now being translated into oncologic imaging protocols
for patient evaluation prior to treatment with antibody-based targeted therapeutics (13–15).
This trend can be attributed to the exquisite specificity of antibodies for tumor-associated
molecular targets/antigens combined with the sensitivity and quantitative nature of PET (16).

Author Manuscript

We envisaged that a real-time, noninvasive, and quantitative approach to evaluate the in vivo
status of DLL3 expression in patient tumors would have immediate clinical utility in the
context of DLL3-targeted therapies. To this end, we have developed a 89Zr-labeled, DLL3targeted immunoconjugate leveraging the humanized antibody, SC16, to serve as a
companion diagnostic immunoPET agent in neuroendocrine carcinoma patients. Here we
report the PET imaging performance of this agent in preclinical mouse models of SCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Gene expression analysis

Author Manuscript

Gene expression data from 2,712 normal samples representing 55 different organs was
downloaded from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (release V4) as reads per
kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM). Raw RNAseq reads from primary
SCLC and normal lung were aligned to the human reference genome GRCh37 with TopHat
v1.1.4 assisted by GENCODE transcript model v18. RPKM values were calculated using
RNA-SeQC v1.1.8 run in strict mode, consistent with published analysis methods for GTEx
release V4. Since both data sets include samples of normal lung, it was possible to apply
batch effect correction prior to further analysis (17).
Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) and quartile normalized gene expression microarray
data for 1,037 cancer cell lines was downloaded from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia
(CCLE). Two SCLC cell lines, H82 and H69, were identified as being representative of
median and low-DLL3 expression, respectively. A gene expression cutoff was set for this
analysis using the approach of Zilliox et al. (18). A549, a non-small cell lung cancer line
exhibiting DLL3 expression below the cutoff, was used as a negative control in the in vitro

and in vivo experiments to validate the DLL3-specific tumor uptake of the SC16-based
radioimmunoconjugates. All downstream analysis and figure generation was performed
using the R statistical computing environment.
Cell lines

Author Manuscript

The cell lines used in this study were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
in 2009 and grown under aseptic conditions in an incubator providing humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. All cell lines were used between 3–9 passages after thawing to
ensure complete revival. In addition to routine testing for mycoplasma, the identity and
purity of the cell lines was validated by STR profiling. H82 and H69 cells were cultured in
RPMI base media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM
HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 4,500 mg/L glucose, 1500 mg/L sodium bicarbonate and
100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. To facilitate the in vivo visualization and
assessment of the growth and spread of tumor cells in orthotopic and metastatic tumor
models for SCLC, H82 cells were transduced with firefly luciferase in the pLENTI6
lentiviral transfer vector (Invitrogen). After blasticidin selection, the resulting cell line, lucH82, was used for in vivo bioluminescence imaging experiments. A549 cells were cultured
in F-12K base media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 U/mL penicillin
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.
Xenograft Models

Author Manuscript

All animals were treated according to the guidelines approved by the Research Animal
Resource Center and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center, NY. Four types of animal models were used in this study: (a)
subcutaneous cell line xenografts; (b) orthotopic cell line xenografts; (c) subcutaneous PDX;
and (d) a distant organ metastasis model. (See SI for details)
Synthesis of DLL3-targeting Radioimmunoconjugates
A DLL3-targeted humanized monoclonal antibody – SC16 (Stemcentrx Inc.) was
chemically modified and radiolabeled with 89Zr to generate a non-site-selectively modified
radioimmunoconjugate (89Zr-DFO-SC16-NS). A single mutation in the heavy chain of SC16
was introduced to facilitate an unpaired cysteine that could be leveraged for site-selective,
maleimide-based conjugation (89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS). Both antibodies were used in the PET
imaging of DLL3 expression in preclinical models of SCLC. (See SI for details)
PET Imaging

Author Manuscript

PET imaging of the subcutaneous and orthotopic cell line xenograft mouse models of SCLC
was conducted on a microPET Focus rodent scanner (Concorde Microsystems)(19), whereas
PET imaging of animals in the metastatic cohort was conducted on an Inveon PET/CT
scanner (Siemens). The various xenografts were administered 89Zr-DFO-SC16
radioimmunoconjugates [9.25 – 11.1 MBq; (250 – 300 μCi), 31–38 μg in PBS treated with
Chelex resin] via intravenous tail vein injection (t = 0). (See SI for details)

Biodistribution Studies

Author Manuscript

In vivo biodistribution studies were performed to evaluate the uptake of the non-siteselective versus site-selectively labeled 89Zr-DFO-SC16 radioimmunoconjugates in mice
bearing subcutaneous xenografts of H82, H69, A549 and PDX tumors. An isotype control
radioimmunoconjugate – 89Zr-DFO-hIgG-SS was injected in mice bearing subcutaneous
H82 xenografts to estimate the non-specific uptake of the radioimmunoconjugate in the
DLL3-positive tumor. For animals in the orthotopic xenograft and metastatic model arms of
this study, a single time point biodistribution analysis was performed upon euthanizing the
animals 120 h after the injection of 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS. (See SI for details)
Ex vivo Analyses

Author Manuscript

Subcutaneously xenografted H82, H69, Lu64, Lu149 and Lu80 tumors (n=4 per tumor type)
were harvested from athymic nude mice that were not injected with any
radioimmunoconjugates. Flash frozen tumor tissue was used for quantitative analyses of
DLL3 expression (ng/mg of tissue) via Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assay. Formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tumor tissue sections were used for immunohistochemical staining of
DLL3 expression and attributed an H-Score upon analysis.
All animals (n=16) in the metastatic cohort of this study injected with 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS
[7.4 MBq; (200 μCi)] for imaging via PET and bioluminescence were euthanized via CO2(g)
asphyxiation and all vital organs including the head were harvested and analyzed for
biodistribution of 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS and histopathology. The read outs from the
histopathological analyses were matched with the PET images to validate their anatomical
correlation.

Author Manuscript

Statistical Analyses
All data presented in this study are expressed as means ± SD. Where applicable, statistical
differences were analyzed by unpaired, two-tailed, Student’s t-test using GraphPad Prism 7
software. Multiple comparisons with adjusted p-values <0.05 were considered statistically
significant. To evaluate the various tumor-to-background tissue ratios between the two
SC16-based radioimmunoconjugates, uncertainty propagation errors were used and a
correction for multiple comparisons was done using the Holm-Sidak method to determine
statistical significance.

RESULTS
Evaluation of DLL3 target expression in SCLC and normal tissues

Author Manuscript

To identify genes expressed in SCLC that are minimally expressed in normal tissues, we
combined RNAseq data from 51 human SCLC samples and 2,712 normal samples,
representing 55 different organs into a single gene expression data set. 27,195 transcripts
with detectable expression in SCLC were ranked based on the scaled difference between the
median SCLC reads per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (RPKM) and the
upper quartile RPKM of the highest expressing normal tissue. The ranked gene list of 3,915
genes with higher median expression in SCLC than any normal tissue was then filtered
based on gene ontology to include genes intrinsic to a membrane and exclude genes with

likely intracellular localization. Of the 60 candidate genes meeting these criteria, and
confirming previous reports (7), DLL3 had the most favorable gene expression profile, being
highly expressed in SCLC with relatively lower levels in pituitary, brain, and testis (Fig.
1A). DLL3 expression in brain tissues was greatest in nucleus accumbens with less
expression in hippocampus (Fig. 1B). No single normal sample exceeded the median
expression in SCLC.
Selection of cell lines for immunoPET

Author Manuscript

In order to identify appropriate cell lines for preclinical testing of a DLL3-targeted
immunoPET agent, we turned to publicly available gene expression data from the Cancer
Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). A mining expedition of the gene expression data from cell
lines in the CCLE yielded an expression cutoff between cells that did not express DLL3, and
the 104/1,015 (10.2%) that expressed various levels of DLL3 (Fig. 1C). Expression data for
SCLC cell lines was extracted, among which, 32/53 (60.4%) expressed DLL3. Two DLL3expressing cell lines, H82 and H69, were chosen for further analysis (Fig. 1C). H82 had
median DLL3 expression and may represent the typical expression level found in human
SCLC cell lines. H69 was selected to represent the lower quartile of DLL3-positive SCLC
cell lines in order to challenge the sensitivity limits of DLL3 immunoPET imaging. In vitro
cell binding assays using 89Zr-DFO-SC16-NS with H82, H69, and A549 cells revealed the
binding of the radioimmunoconjugate to bear excellent concordance to the predicted level of
DLL3 expressed by the 3 cell lines (Fig. 1D). Further, a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assay
yielded 58.2 ng/mg, 14 ng/mg and 1 ng/mg of DLL3 expressed by H82, H69 and A549
tumors respectively. Similarly, immunohistochemistry yielded H-scores of 195, 55 and 0
respectively for the three tumors (Fig. 1F).

Characterization of the radioimmunoconjugates and target abundance
We synthesized two SC16-based immunoconjugates to evaluate as immunoPET tracers for
the molecular imaging of DLL3 in preclinical models of SCLC. One of these
immunoconjugates — DFO-SC16-NS — was synthesized through the random coupling of
isothiocyanate-bearing DFO moieties to the lysines of the antibody, while the other — DFOSC16-SS — was created via the site-selective conjugation of a maleimide-bearing variant of
DFO with unpaired cysteine residues within the hinge region of the SC16 immunoglobulin
(Fig. 2A). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that DFO-SC16-NS had ~3.5 DFOs per
antibody, with DFOs distributed between the light and heavy chains of the antibody (Figs.
S1a–d). A similar analysis of DFO-SC16-SS revealed that it had 2.8 DFOs conjugated per
antibody (Figs. S2a–d). Both the constructs showed ≥ 90% immunoreactive fractions as
determined via surface plasmon resonance experiments (Fig. S3a–b).

Author Manuscript

Upon radiolabeling with 89Zr4+, both 89Zr-DFO-SC16-NS and 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS were
reproducibly obtained in high radiochemical yields (>95 %) and high specific activities (7.5
– 9.0 mCi/mg). The radioimmunoconjugates were isolated in high radiochemical purity
(>99%), and demonstrated ≥95% stability (89Zr-DFO-SC16-NS) and 85% stability (89ZrDFO-SC16-SS) against demetallation when incubated in human serum at 37 °C over a
period of 5 days (Figs. S4 and S5). Saturation ligand-binding assays performed on sections
prepared from subcutaneously xenografted H82 and H69 tumors validated the nanomolar

affinity (KD) of the 89Zr-DFO-SC16-NS construct for binding to DLL3 and yielded Bmax
concentrations of 14.7 ± 0.6 nM (H82) and 6.0 ± 0.5 nM (H69) to indicate the maximum
number of DLL3 sites available per cell for binding of the SC16 antibody in the respective
tumors. The nanomolar Bmax concentration was converted to numeric values based on a
mean SCLC cell diameter of 10 μm, which yielded ~ 14,000 and 6,000 DLL3 molecules
available per cell in H82 and H69 tumor sections respectively (Fig. 1E) (20). A comparison
of this range of expression levels of DLL3 with other tumor-associated antigens that have
been targeted for the immunoPET imaging of cancer revealed that DLL3 expression in
SCLC was lower by at least 2 orders of magnitude (Fig. 1G) (21–30). Finally, although
upregulated in SCLC relative to non-malignant adult cells, DLL3 is a remarkably lowabundance protein on the surface of tumor cells, having on the order of only 10,000
molecules expressed per cell. We hypothesized that immunoPET imaging might still be
feasible given the near-complete absence of DLL3 cell surface expression on normal tissues.

Evaluation of SC16-based radioimmunoconjugates in subcutaneous xenograft models

Author Manuscript

In vivo PET imaging studies with the two SC16-based radioimmunoconjugates clearly
delineated H82 and H69 tumors in subcutaneous xenografts (Figs. 2B–E). A higher
concentration of radioactivity was found in the H82 tumors than in H69 tumors. Conversely,
even 120 h after the injection of the 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS and 89Zr-DFO-SC16-NS, a higher
PET signal was found to persist in the systemic circulation of H69 xenografts (Figs. 2C and
2E). The in vivo biodistribution of the radioimmunoconjugates in subcutaneous H82 and
H69 xenografts demonstrated a progressively increasing concentration of radioactivity in the
tumors over time (Figs. 3A, 3D, S6–S9). The tumoral uptake values of the
radioimmunoconjugates in H82 and H69 tumors corresponded well with the level of DLL3
expression in these tumors as determined via in vitro and ex vivo analyses.
Specifically, 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS yielded an uptake value of 27.3 ± 6.0 %ID/g in H82
tumors, whereas the H69 tumors afforded 16.2 ± 5.8 %ID/g. Furthermore, the concentration
of radioactivity in both the tumors could be blocked by the co-injection of a 100-fold excess
of un-labeled SC16 antibody (Figs. 3A and 3D; Tables S1 and S2).

Author Manuscript

A comparison between the biodistribution of the site-selectively labeled versus non-siteselectively labeled SC16-based radioimmunoconjugates in H82 xenografts revealed
that 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS yielded a tumor uptake of 27.3 ± 6.0 %ID/g whereas 89Zr-DFOSC16-NS afforded 19.5 ± 4.8 %ID/g (Fig. 3B; Tables S1 and S3). Notably, a higher
concentration of radioactivity was observed in the kidneys of H82 xenografts injected with
the site-selectively labeled construct (6.2 ± 1.1 %ID/g) than those injected with 89Zr-DFOSC16-NS (3.5 ± 0.5 %ID/g) (Fig. 3B; Tables S1 and S3). A similar trend was observed for
the biodistribution of the SC16-based radioimmunoconjugates in the tumors and background
tissues of H69 xenografts (Figs. 3E and S10; Tables S2 and S4). Despite the slightly higher
activity concentrations of 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS in the tumors and kidneys of H82 xenografts,
comparable tumor-to-background ratios were obtained for 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS versus 89ZrDFO-SC16-NS injected in H82 xenografts in most tissues except the liver, which displayed
a marginally significant difference (adjusted p-value = 0.076) (Fig. 3C, Table S5). Further,
an evaluation of the ratio of the tumor-to-background ratios between 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS
and 89Zr-DFO-SC16-NS yielded Tumor-to-Kidney(SS/NS) = 0.79 ± 0.31; Tumor-to-

Liver(SS/NS) = 2.14 ± 1.04; Tumor-to-Blood(SS/NS) = 1.13 ± 0.48; and Tumor-toMuscle(SS/NS) = 1.36 ± 0.55. Finally, the biodistribution of 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS in
subcutaneous xenografts of a DLL3-negative non-small cell lung cancer (A549) compared
well with that of a site-selectively radiolabeled anti-hapten isotype-matched IgG (89Zr-DFOhIgG-SS) in DLL3-positive H82 xenografts. In both these cases, low and non-specific
uptake of the radioimmunoconjugates was observed based on the in vivo enhanced
permeability and retention effect (5–7 %ID/g at 120 h p.i.) (Figs. 3F, S11, S12; Tables S6
and S7).

Author Manuscript

These data are particularly encouraging since the SC16 antibody is known to cross-react
with murine DLL3 protein (7). The observed accretion of the SC16-radioimmunoconjugates
in SCLC tumors is highly specific and attributed to the tumor selective expression of human
DLL3, and not due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect in tumors or the
lack of species cross-reactivity that can artificially lower the background signal in
immunoPET imaging studies.
DLL3 PET imaging of orthotopic, metastatic and PDX models of SCLC
In an orthotopic model of SCLC, a high concordance was achieved between the
bioluminescence signal from luc-H82 tumors engrafted in the left lung of athymic nude mice
and PET imaging with 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS, which successfully delineated the lung tumors
(Figs. 4A-C and S13). Analysis of the biodistribution of 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS in this model
showed a highly selective concentration of radioactivity within the orthotopically
xenografted left lung versus the right lung (Fig. 4D).

In a mouse model developed to mimic distant organs metastases of SCLC, PET/CT imaging
with 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS followed by necropsy for biodistribution studies at 136 h after the
injection of the radioimmiunoconjugate revealed a diverse set of findings. Though varying in
intensity, the most prominent signal was obtained from the livers in all the mice that were
examined in this cohort. Necropsy of the animals revealed the abundance of metastatic
nodules to have a strong qualitative concordance with the intensity of the PET signal
observed in the liver. Liver tissue with a semi-quantitative histopathological score of 2–3,
yielded low intensity PET signal and had an uptake of ~10.7 ± 1.2 %ID/g as measured from
biodistribution analysis. On the other hand, livers with a histopathological score of 5–6
yielded a relatively high intensity PET signal with an uptake of ~ 14 ± 1.5 %ID/g as
measured in biodistribution analysis (Fig. 4K). The high intensity foci of PET signal from
the liver correlated well with coalescing metastatic lesions found in the liver tissues
examined via histopathology. Interestingly, 50% (8/16) of the animals in the metastatic
experimental cohort showed unilateral and/or bilateral PET-positive ovaries (Figs. 4E, 4I,
4K). There was a strong correlation between findings from PET imaging, necropsy,
biodistribution analysis and histopathology of the ovarian tissues. No false positives were
obtained in our studies despite unilateral involvement of ovarian metastases in 37.5 % (3/8)
of cases.
Among other sites of interest for metastases in our experimental cohort, 50% (8/16) of the
mice showed distinct PET and bioluminescence signals within the head (Figs. 5A and 5B).
Histopathologic analysis revealed a predominant infiltration of the hemimandibles (Figs. 5C

and 5D) and sporadic infiltration of the pituitary gland (Fig. S14). On the other hand,
although the bone tissue was positive on PET images (Figs. 4E, S15), the regional
localization of the PET signal was somewhat discordant with that of neoplastic cells found
in this tissue. Furthermore, a consistently high concentration of radioactivity was seen in the
spleen, which appeared strongly PET-positive (Figs. S16A, S16C) and was associated with
uptake values >85 %ID/g as determined in the biodistribution analysis of all the mice within
the metastatic model cohort. However, all the spleens examined were histopathologically
negative for the presence of tumor cells (Fig. S16B and S16D). Interestingly, tandem
injections with the same batch of the radioimmunoconjugate in female athymic nude mice
did not yield high intensity splenic PET signals (Fig. S17, S18).

When injected in mice bearing subcutaneously transplanted SCLC PDX, 89Zr-DFO-SC16SS clearly delineated the PDX tumors via PET imaging (Figs. 6A–C). In biodistribution
studies, Lu64 tumors, which have the highest reported DLL3 expression (4.25 ng/mg) and
sensitivity to treatment with SC16LD6.5 (7), demonstrated the highest tumor uptake of 89ZrDFO-SC16-SS (67.7 ± 13.8 %ID/g) at 120 h after the injection of the
radioimmunoconjugate in the present study (Figs. 6A, 6D, 6E, 6F). On the other hand,
Lu149 tumors, which represented a median concentration for DLL3 expression (2.71 ng/
mg), demonstrated an intermediate tumor uptake for 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS (38.1 ± 1.8 %ID/g)
at 120 h after the injection of the radioimmunoconjugate (Figs. 6B, 6D, 6E, 6F). Finally,
Lu80 tumors were representative of a low DLL3 expression candidate (0.6 ng/mg) and
afforded the least uptake (21.2 ± 2.4 %ID/g) in the tumors at 120 h after the injection of the
radioimmunoconjugate (Figs. 6C–F). Surprisingly, despite the low level of DLL3 expression
in the Lu80 PDX tumors, a relatively high concentration of radioactivity was found
associated with these tumors. To some extent, this may be due to perfusion from a sheath of
blood that encased the subcutaneously xenografted Lu80 tumors unlike other PDXs
examined in this study (Fig. S19). Notably, many tumors in the SC16LD6.5-treated cohorts
of Lu80 have previously been shown to escape disease control (7).

DISCUSSION
Early phase clinical trials of Rova-T have assessed DLL3 expression from initial diagnostic
biopsies by IHC. Although IHC appears to be an effective method to assess DLL3
expression status, it suffers from several practical limitations that may hinder its utility in the
clinic, chief among them being the requirement for invasive research biopsies in previously
treated SCLC, which may recur in inaccessible sites and for which clinical justification for
re-biopsy is generally lacking.

Premised on the early success of Rova-T and the emerging role of precision medicine to
improve clinical outcomes, we envisaged that a companion imaging diagnostic for this drug
could potentially facilitate the identification, selection and stratification of SCLC patients for
treatment with Rova-T on the basis of their in vivo DLL3 expression status and serve as a
tool with which to monitor for recurrence or determine whether Rova-T retreatment should
be an option for patients upon recurrence. A DLL3-targeted molecular imaging agent could
potentially provide clinicians with real-time information about the in vivo expression of

DLL3 while concomitantly delineating SCLC tumors in a noninvasive whole body PET
scan.
The foremost challenge to image DLL3 expression via PET lay in its low abundance on the
surface of tumor cells. Syndecan-1 and HER3 are among the few other tumor-associated
antigens with similar expression densities that have been targeted for the PET imaging of
cancer (24, 28, 29). In our hands, although the in vivo tumor uptake of the site-selectivelylabeled SC16 radioimmunoconjugate (89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS) was not significantly different
from its non-site-selectively-labeled cousin (89Zr-DFO-SC16-NS), 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS
represented a biochemically site-selective and functionally active radioimmunoconjugate
that yielded favorable in vivo tumor-to-background ratios that might be further improved.

Among the chosen SCLC cell line tumors, the relatively low target sink provided by the H69
tumors resulted in a higher concentration of radioactivity to persist within the systemic
circulation of H69 tumor-bearing mice even 120 h after the injection of the
radioimmunoconjugates. This observation may be critical to the dosing of patients with the
Rova-T ADC and/or potential targeted-radiotherapy with 177Lu/90Y-labeled SC16 antibody,
wherein patients with lesser tumor burden or lower in vivo tumoral expression of DLL3 are
more likely to have an excess of the “targeted” drug lingering within the systemic
circulation. In such patients, adjusted dosing of the DLL3-targeted ADC or
radioimmunotherapeutic agent may be warranted to avoid treatment-related toxicities.

Finally, a critical benchmark that defines the clinical utility of immunoPET tracers lies in
their ability to predict response to therapy based on in vivo imaging. In this context, 89ZrDFO-SC16-SS demonstrated rank order correlation in clinically representative PDX models
of SCLC with previously documented responses to therapy with SC16LD6.5. Furthermore,
the ability of 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS to noninvasively delineate micrometastatic foci with high
sensitivity may potentially translate into the clinical detection of distant organ
micrometastatic lesions in patients. Metastases to the brain are a common finding in SCLC
patients and cannot be detected via 18F-FDG-PET due to the background caused by high
uptake of glucose in the brain. The PET imaging performance of 89Zr-labeled Trastuzumab
in the clinic encourages us to speculate that DLL3 immunoPET could potentially enable the
identification of metastatic lesions in the brain of SCLC patients (31). Furthermore, our
findings of the multinodular infiltration pattern in the ovaries of mice within the metastatic
cohort were consistent with clinical reports of metastatic SCLC found in the ovaries of
human patients (32). Sparing of the ovarian surface epithelium and bursa in all the cases that
were examined is indicative of the hematogenous spread of the disease to the ovary.
Although metastases to the mandible and alveolar bone is seldom observed in human
patients, in our preclinical model the premolar–molar region may be providing an ideal site
for metastatic seeding due to a predominance of red bone marrow and retardation of the
circulation in this anatomic location.
Despite the excellent in vivo performance of 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS as a DLL3 PET imaging
agent, our experiments highlighted some limitations of the immunoPET agent and the
preclinical models that were used for its evaluation. Most importantly, the chelator-toantibody ratio (CAR = 1–4) for the site-selectively labeled 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS construct

used for PET imaging experiments differs from the drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR = 2) for the
Rova-T construct used in clinical trials. This may be a result of a stronger reduction of the
inter-chain disulfide bonds in the SC16 antibody with a 10-fold molar excess of TCEP used
for the synthesis of 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS compared to the 1–2 fold molar excess of the mildreducing agent used in the synthesis of SC16LD6.5 (7). In our case, a high CAR was
desirable in order to yield a high specific activity immunoPET imaging agent that retains
target binding capability and can delineate the expression of a low abundance tumor specific
target such as DLL3.

Author Manuscript

Arguably, the elevated concentration of radioactivity in the kidneys of xenografts injected
with 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS may be attributed to the labile nature of the thiol-maleimide
linkage for in vivo hydrolysis. This is exacerbated by the tendency of the thioether bond to
undergo retro-Michael addition reactions in the presence of reactive thiols of serum proteins
such as albumin and/or free cysteines and glutathione present in the kidneys (33). Through
this mechanism, the macrocylic chelator and the 89Zr encased within it could be dissociated
from the antibody and be systemically cleared through the kidneys. More stable thiolreactive methylsufonyl-functionalized heteroaromatic linkers may improve the stability of
the immunoconjugate (34). Another limitation revealed by immunoPET imaging with 89ZrDFO-SC16-SS in the metastatic SCLC model was the PET signal observed in the bone and
the spleen, which had discordant histopathologic read outs for the presence of metastases in
these tissues. These observations may most likely be related to the biology of the
immunocompromised NSG mouse strain.

In conclusion, the work at hand describes the thorough preclinical evaluation of a DLL3targeted companion diagnostic agent for potential use in the clinic. Such a tracer can
noninvasively provide real-time information about the status of in vivo DLL3 expression and
delineate the presence of SCLC tumors to facilitate the selection of patients for treatment
with a therapeutic counterpart such as Rova-T and other DLL3-targeted therapeutics.
Additionally, several salient features related to the development of immunoPET tracers and
preclinical animal models were highlighted through the experiments undertaken in this
study. First, our study demonstrates that low abundance tumor-associated molecular targets/
antigens such as DLL3 can be targeted for PET imaging, provided the target is unique to
neoplastic cells and its in vivo expression in background tissues is minimal. Next, our study
illustrates a comparative evaluation of using site-selectively modified immunoconjugates
over their non-site-selectively modified cousins for applications related to the targeted
imaging and therapy of cancer. In this context, the critical role and limitations of the
chemistry used in the preparation of such immunoconjugates was highlighted. Finally, the
DLL3 PET imaging agent 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS consistently demonstrated highly sensitive
and selective targeting of DLL3 to delineate SCLC tumors in vivo in a host of preclinical
mouse models.

mandible at the level of the molars (m). Even at low magnification, the localization of
neoplastic cells within the right hemimandible (blue dashed ellipse) is evident and consistent
with the signals observed in the PET image and focally high luminescence observed in the
BLI image; (D) A magnified view of the right mandible. The blue arrows point to the
neoplastic cells that infiltrated and replaced most of the alveolar bone around the incisors
root (ir). The dentin (d) of the tooth was intact; (E) A magnified view of the left
hemimandible, which was devoid of neoplastic cells, confirming the lack of signal in the
PET scan and BLI image; (F) An H&E-stained section of the two ovaries of the mouse
shown in A. The ovary on the left of the image is massively enlarged due to metastatic
invasion by the tumor cells. However, the salpinx (s) and the ovarian bursa (ob) were spared
from neoplastic infiltration. The contralateral ovary appeared normal in size and showed the
presence of immature follicles (f), which were visible within the organ. The inset shows a
portion of the lower abdomen from the PET image, wherein the unilateral PET-positive
ovary is seen corresponding to the histopathological findings; (G) H&E-stained sections of
the liver from the mouse shown in A. Multiple coalescing neoplastic nodules (n) were found
within the liver lobes and tend to replace more than 50% of the liver parenchyma. The
multifocal and coalescing pattern of the nodules appear as multiple high intensity signals in
the PET MIP. The perivascular localization (v) of metastases was a consistent finding in
H&E-stained sections of all the liver tissues examined from animals in the metastatic cohort.

PET images of 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS in athymic nude mice bearing PDX – (A) Lu64 (high
DLL3 expression); (B) Lu149 (medium DLL3 expression); and (C) Lu80 (low DLL3
expression). White arrows (A–C) point to the subcutaneously xenografted PDX tumors seen
in the PET images. Red arrow (C) points to the heart and is indicative of radioactivity
persisting within systemic circulation, due to the lack of a target sink in the Lu80 tumors;
(D) A tabulated representation of the concordance between the uptake of 89Zr-DFO-SC16SS in the three PDX lines with their levels of DLL3 expression, and parameters to indicate
response to therapy – %TGI (percentage tumor growth inhibition upon treatment with the
antibody drug conjugate – SC16LD6.5) and dTTP (delta time to progression) for the PDX
tumors after treatment with SC16LD6.5; (E) Biodistribution of 89Zr-DFO-SC16-SS in select
tissues examined from the PDX tumor bearing mice (n=4 per PDX line); (F)
Immunohistochemistry on PDX tumors for DLL3 expression. Lu64 showed high DLL3
expression, Lu149 showed medium DLL3 expression and Lu80 showed minimal DLL3
expression. Right low corner: scale bar for 100μm. (G) A plot of the saturation binding
curves derived from the ex vivo binding of 89Zr-DFO-SC16-NS to sections of Lu64, Lu149
and Lu80 tumor tissue harvested from subcutaneous xenografts in mice. The curves enabled
the estimation of the maximum number of DLL3 target binding sites on the PDX tumors.
Lu64 had ~9400 binding sites and Lu149 had 8600 binding sites. Lu80 had negligible DLL3
expression – too low to be determined by the assay.
