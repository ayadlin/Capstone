BACKGROUND: Individuals who had past hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection appeared to clear their serum hepatitis B
surface antigen (HBsAg) while producing antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAb), which is detectable in
their serum. Currently, it is uncertain whether patients with past HBV infection require routine antiviral prophylaxis
during chemotherapy, although some cancer agencies recommend its routine use. The objective of the current study
was to determine the prevalence of past HBV infection in patients with lymphoma and its relevance in terms of HBVrelated complications. METHODS: The authors reviewed 430 patients with lymphoma from May 2006 to May 2008.
RESULTS: Among the 430 patients, 233 had both the HBsAg and HBcAb tests performed, whereas 197 had only the
HBsAg test performed. Among those with both tests performed, 34.3% (80 of 233) were HBcAb positive only. Of
these 80 patients, 58 had a concomitant HBV DNA level test, which was positive in 3 (5.2%). Of the 67 patients with
past and 26 with chronic HBV infection who received chemotherapy, HBV reactivation occurred in 1.5% and 42.3% of
patients, respectively (P<.0001). Prophylactic lamivudine was administered in 7 (10.4%) patients with past HBV infection and in 18 (69.2%) with chronic HBV infection. CONCLUSIONS: The low rate of HBV reactivation reported in our
study coupled with the high prevalence of past HBV infection in an endemic area suggests that routine usage of antiviral prophylaxis may not be required for all patients with past HBV infection. Close surveillance remains a reasonable

KEYWORDS: antiviral prophylaxis, hepatitis B, lymphoma, reactivation.

Viral infectionsfor instance hepatitis B and C virusare associated with the development of malignant lympho-

mas,1-6 with implications for chemotherapy-related complications. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in lymphoma patients with chronic HBV infection is a well-known and often fatal complication of chemotherapy.7
Prophylactic lamivudine is beneficial in reducing HBV reactivation,8,9 mortality, and treatment delays during chemotherapy in patients who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive.
Individuals who had past HBV infection appeared to clear their serum HBsAg while producing antibody to hepatitis
B core antigen (HBcAb), which is detectable in their serum. Hence, the presence of HBcAb is evidence of past HBV infection in patients who are negative for HBsAg. Current knowledge regarding the epidemiology and incidence of patients
with past HBV infection is lacking. Whether this group of patients is at equal risk of HBV reactivation during chemotherapy remains to be elucidated.
Patients who receive livers from HBsAg–negative but HBcAb–positive donors routinely receive antiviral prophylaxis.10 However, the benefits of antiviral prophylaxis for this group of patients with aggressive lymphoma
receiving chemotherapy are uncertain. This issue may be particularly important today, as immunotherapy such as
rituximab is increasingly incorporated into chemotherapy regimens. To the best of our knowledge, the association
between rituximab and HBV reactivation is still unknown, although a study by Sera et al has shown that rituximab

suppresses the B lymphocytes, impairing the number
and function of B lymphocytes, and may result in
HBV reactivation.11 Rituximab appeared to reduce the
antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAb), and
thus might induce an immunological environment that
allows for easy HBV reactivation.12 Several case reports
suggest that rituximab in combination with chemotherapy may increase the risk of HBV reactivation.13,14 Of
concern, there have also been reported cases of HBV
reactivation in patients with past HBV infection
(HBsAg negative, HBcAb positive) during the course
of chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy, sometimes
proving fatal.15,16 Nevertheless, it remains uncertain
whether patients with past HBV infection are at a substantial risk for reactivation of latent HBV.17
Hence, in the current study, we sought 1) to elucidate the incidence of past HBV infection among a population of lymphoma patients and 2) to examine its effect on
the risk of HBV-related complications after systemic
treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The institutional review board approved this research
project.
We reviewed an unselected and consecutive series of
430 lymphoma patients seen between May 2006 and May
2008. All patients were tested for HBsAg. Before May
2007, HBcAb (total) test was performed at the discretion
of the treating physician. After May 2007, HBcAb (total)
test and HBsAb test were performed for all patients. The
majority of patients who were HBcAb positive were tested
for HBV DNA. The diagnostic criteria used to determine
lymphoma subtype were based on the World Health Organization (WHO)/Revised European-American Lymphoma classification system for malignant lymphomas.
All patients were staged before treatment using the Ann
Arbor staging system. The patients with chronic HBV
infection and past HBV infection, who received systemic
treatment, were evaluated for transaminitis and HBV
reactivation for a 1-year follow-up period from the date of
diagnosis. Liver function tests were performed before each
cycle of chemotherapy and every 2 to 3 months after completion of systemic treatment for the first year. We tested
the majority of patients for HBV DNA level when they
developed transaminitis during or after systemic chemotherapy. The HBV DNA tests used were branched DNA
signal amplification (Bayer Versant HBV DNA 3.0 assay,

lower detection limit: 2000 copies/mL [or 357 IU/mL])
and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(Roche Cobas Ampliprep/Cobas TaqMan HBV Test,
lower detection limit: 12 IU/mL or 70 copies/mL at 95%
confidence level). Before May 2007, HBsAb test was not
routinely performed for all patients but at the discretion
of the treating physician.
Definitions
A patient with chronic HBV infection (ie, HBV carrier)
was defined as having detectable serum HBsAg. A patient
who was tested negative for HBsAg but positive
for HBcAb (total) was defined as having past HBV
infection.
The severity of hepatitis was defined according to
the WHO criteria. Grade 0 was defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <1.25  upper limit of normal (ULN),
grade 1 was defined as an elevation of ALT >1.25 
ULN and up to 2.5  ULN, grade 2 was defined as an elevation of ALT >2.5  ULN and up to 5.0  ULN, grade
3 was defined as an elevation of ALT >5.0  ULN and
up to 10.0  ULN, and grade 4 was defined as an elevation >10  ULN.
Hepatitis attributable to HBV reactivation was
defined as an increase in HBV DNA levels of 10-fold or
more when compared with baseline levels or an absolute
increase >105 copies/mL in the HBV DNA levels.18
Disruption of chemotherapy was defined as either a
premature termination of chemotherapy or a delay of >1
week of chemotherapy between cycles.
Treatment
The treatment regimens received were reviewed. Among
the 31 patients with chronic HBV infection, 26 underwent chemotherapy. Among them, 17 received rituximab-based treatment and 17 received anthracycline-based
treatment. Of the 80 patients with past HBV infection,
67 proceeded with chemotherapy. Forty-six patients
received rituximab-based treatment, and 44 received
anthracycline-based treatment.
Statistical Analysis
The clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with
chronic HBV infection and past HBV were evaluated.
Differences in baseline demographics and lymphoma
characteristics among patients with chronic HBV infection and past HBV infection were then compared using
the Student t test or chi-square test for continuous or categoric variables, respectively. The prognostic factors

studied included HBV status, age, sex, Ann Arbor stage of
disease at presentation, performance status (ie, Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] status), extranodal involvement, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
level, International Prognostic Index, B symptoms, and
chemotherapy regimens prescribed.

RESULTS
Figure 1 summarizes the hepatitis B profile of the lymphoma patients in this study. Among the 430 patients
tested for HBsAg, the prevalence of chronic HBV infection was 7.2% (31 of 430). Importantly, 233 patients had
both tests performed and 80 (34.3%) were HBcAb positive only. Among the 80 patients who tested positive for
HBcAb only, 58 had a HBV DNA test performed, which
was positive in 3 (5.2%) patients. Furthermore, 61 of the
80 patients were tested for HBsAb; 42 and 19 were
HBsAb positive and negative, respectively.
Table 1 compares the baseline patient and lymphoma characteristics of patients with chronic and past
HBV infection at the time of diagnosis. As shown, there
was no significant difference noted between patients with
chronic and past HBV infection in terms of age, sex, Ann
Arbor staging, extranodal involvement, ECOG status, serum LDH, and histologic distribution.
Table 2 summarizes the hepatitis B-related events of
lymphoma patients undergoing systemic treatment,
including rituximab. Among the 67 patients with past
HBV infection, 1 (1.5%) developed HBV reactivation;
among 46 patients receiving rituximab, 1 (2.2%) experienced reactivation; and among 60 patients who did not
receive prophylaxis, 1 (1.7%) developed reactivation. In

comparison, among the 26 patients with chronic HBV
infection, 11 (43.2%) experienced reactivation; among 17
patients receiving rituximab, 7 (41.2%) developed reactivation; among 18 patients who received antiviral prophylaxis, 7 (38.9%) experienced reactivation; and among the
8 patients who did not receive antiviral prophylaxis, 4
(50%) experienced reactivation. It is interesting to note
that only 10% of patients with past HBV infection
received antiviral prophylaxis, compared with 70% of the
patients with chronic HBV infection.
Of 25 patients shown in Table 2 with elevated ALT
during systemic treatment, 19 were tested for HBV DNA
when they developed transaminitis, which was positive in
1. Six patients did not have HBV DNA tested, as they had
very transient grade 1 to 2 transaminitis that resolved
before the next cycle of chemotherapy without intervention or interruption of chemotherapy and without further
elevation of ALT. Of these 6 patients, transient transaminitis was because of chemotherapy in 4 and neutropenic
sepsis in 2 patients. In the remaining 18 patients without
evidence of HBV DNA, transaminitis was because of
chemotherapy in 11, sepsis in 4, disease progression in 2,
and cardiac failure in 1 patient.
Of the 67 patients with past HBV infection who
received chemotherapy, 50 were tested for HBsAb; 34 and
16 were HBsAb positive and negative, respectively. None
of the 34 patients who were positive for HBsAb developed
reactivation, compared with 1 who was negative for
HBsAb.
Table 3 shows the details of the patient with past
HBV infection who experienced reactivation. Importantly, she developed reactivation 2 months after chemotherapy (comprised of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide,

DISCUSSION
The prevalence of past HBV infection in our lymphoma
patients was 34.3%, which is consistent with a recent
study by Targhetta et al involving 1087 patients with
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,19 among whom 36% were
found to be HBcAb positive only. Nonetheless, the incidence of past HBV infection in patients with lymphoma
was relatively high, and in our study, approximately 5.2%
of them in fact had occult HBV infection, defined as the

presence of hepatitis B viremia (ie, detectable HBV DNA
level). This finding is provocative and suggests that testing
for HBsAg alone is insufficient for the screening of HBV
infection in endemic areas, because 5.2% of patients with
HBV viremia will not be detected. They may still be at
risk of HBV reactivation similar to patients with chronic
HBV infection.
Several large series have consistently demonstrated a
higher incidence of chronic HBV infection among
patients with lymphoma compared with the general population.1-6 The high incidence (34.3%) of past HBV
infection in patients with lymphoma supports the hypothesis that HBV may play a role in the epidemiology and
pathogenesis of malignant lymphoma, at least in endemic
areas, particularly because a proportion of these patients
are viremic. Testing of HBV surface antigen alone may in
fact underestimate the true prevalence of chronic HBV
infection in lymphoma patients. Indeed, a study from
Taiwan20 examining the sera of HBsAg-negative patients
with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and nonlymphoma solid tumors and healthy volunteers for the
presence of HBV DNA found a statistically higher incidence of occult HBV infection in HBsAg-negative
patients with B-cell NHL compared with others. Taken

together, these data suggest a potential epidemiologic
association between HBV and the development of malignant lymphoma.
Various studies have shown that patients with
chronic HBV infection are at risk of HBV reactivation
during chemotherapy7,11,21-25 and recently, the use of rituximab has also been demonstrated to increase the rates of
viral infection and viral reactivation.11-14 In contrast, the
risk of developing HBV-related liver complications after
chemotherapy and immunotherapy in patients with past
HBV (isolated HBcAb positive) infection has not been
well studied. The results of the current study found the
risk of HBV reactivation during the course of systemic
chemotherapy to be low; only 1 (1.5%) of the 67 patients
experienced reactivation. Specifically, none of the 21
patients receiving chemotherapy alone developed reactivation, whereas 1 (2.2%) of the 46 patients receiving rituxi-

mab-based treatment did. Among the 60 patients who did
not receive antiviral prophylaxis during systemic therapy,
only 1 (1.7%) patient experienced reactivation. Compared with patients with chronic HBV infection, the incidence of HBV reactivation in those with past HBV
infection was significantly lower, despite similar presenting characteristics and liver function test and significantly
fewer patients receiving antiviral prophylaxis (Table 2).
This finding is again consistent with the risk of 1%
reported by Targhetta et al,19 but is in contrast to several
smaller case series reported earlier in literature.15 However, in the report by Targhetta et al, information regarding the use of prophylactic lamivudine was not provided.
More importantly, the relatively low risk of HBV
reactivation has therapeutic significance. To the best of
our knowledge, there are currently no data regarding the
management of patients with past HBV infection in HBV

endemic areas, and the benefits and role of antiviral prophylaxis are uncertain. Nevertheless, several national
organizations and practice guidelines such as the British
Columbia Cancer Agency recommend prophylactic lamivudine for all patients with past HBV infection. This recommendation is supported by isolated case reports of
reactivation.9,15,16,26 Because of the variations in HBV
profile among different populations, the recommendations made by the British Columbia Cancer Agency may
not be entirely applicable to HBV endemic regions (eg,
Asia); 1 in 3 patients with newly diagnosed lymphoma
will require prophylactic lamivudine if these recommendations are followed as suggested by our data. On the basis
of the low risk of HBV reactivation (1.5%) reported in
the current study, the routine use of antiviral prophylaxis
in this group of patients might not be substantiated.
Nonetheless, we caution that the only patient who
experienced reactivation in the current study was treated
with rituximab. However, the low reactivation rate of
2.2% among those receiving rituximab-containing regimens does not appear to justify the routine use of antiviral
prophylaxis for all patients receiving rituximab. Apart
from the increase in healthcare costs, the long-term use of
lamivudine may induce the development of lamivudineresistant HBV.23,27,28 One might, however, argue that
newer antiviral agents with different resistant patterns are
now available and might ameliorate this concern. Furthermore, it is conceivable that the cost of antiviral medications might be offset by the costs of managing patients
with hepatitis flares or hepatic failure. Conversely, one
should also take into consideration the finding that greater
than one–third of patients in HBV endemic areas are
likely to have evidence of past HBV infection. Moreover,
immunotherapy with drugs such as rituximab and infliximab has increasingly broad applications across various
specialties, including oncology, immunology, rheumatology, and dermatology, and its usage will correspondingly
increase with time. Thus, despite the availability of newer
antiviral agents, it is still important to carefully appraise
the need as well as the long-term implications of routine
antiviral prophylaxis for a potentially large group of
patients who might never need treatment. Before making
any recommendation of this magnitude, a critical assessment of the risk of HBV reactivation and the associated
risk factors is crucial. We believe that the data from the
current study provide the rationale for such a study before
the practice of routine antiviral prophylaxis is universally
implemented without robust basis.

120

It is also interesting to note that the only patient
who developed reactivation in the current study did not
have detectable HBV DNA at diagnosis. Patients who are
HBsAg negative but HBcAb positive with detectable
HBV DNA are often considered to have occult HBV
infection and may have the same risk of reactivation as
their counterparts with chronic HBV. Although all 3
patients in the current study with detectable HBV DNA
at diagnosis did not develop reactivation despite not
receiving routine antiviral prophylaxis, we are unable to
determine the risk of HBV reactivation in this group of
patients with certainty because of the small number. Conceivably, antiviral prophylaxis might be important in this
group of patients, similar to their counterparts with
chronic HBV infection. Apart from detectable HBV
DNA at diagnosis, it is important to identify other clinical
factors associated with the risk of hepatitis B reactivation
in this group of patients with past HBV, such as the absence of HBsAb. Again, we are limited by the finding that
only 1 patient suffered reactivation in this study.
In conclusion, based on the high incidence of past
HBV infection (34.3%) reported in the current study and
the observation that a proportion (5.2%) had occult HBV
infection, we recommend that lymphoma patients should
be tested for HBcAb in addition to HBsAg. If positive,
they should also be tested for the presence of HBV DNA,
because it remains uncertain whether patients with detectable HBV DNA in this setting are at an increased risk of
reactivation, and antiviral prophylaxis might still be indicated. For the majority of patients with past HBV infection, routine antiviral prophylaxis may not be required
even when rituximab is used. Close surveillance instead of
routine antiviral prophylaxis may be a more rational
approach. Further prospective studies will be needed to
clarify the role of routine antiviral prophylaxis in patients
with past HBV infection.
