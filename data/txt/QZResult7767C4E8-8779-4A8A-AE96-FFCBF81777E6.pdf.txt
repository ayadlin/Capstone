Abstract
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a nutrient and
ATP sensor suggested to play an important role in tumorigenesis, particularly in the setting of PTEN loss or activated
Akt/PKB. Of mTOR’s two known effectors, eIF4E has been
implicated in tumorigenesis, whereas the role of S6 kinase
(S6K1) in transformation is less understood. To assess the
contribution of S6K1 to the transformed phenotype, we pharmacologically and genetically manipulated the mTOR-S6K
pathway in glioma cells and monitored its effects on growth in
soft agar, a hallmark of cellular transformation, and also
assessed in vivo intracranial growth. Anchorage-independent
growth by HRasV12-transformed human astrocytes as well
as by U251 and U373 human glioma cells was inhibited by
pharmacologic mTOR inhibition. Similarly, short hairpin
RNA–mediated suppression of mTOR also reduced anchorage-independent growth of glioma cell lines. Expression of
wild-type eIF4E in rapamycin-treated E6/E7/hTert/HRasV12
and U373 cells failed to rescue colony formation, although
expression of wild-type S6K1 or rapamycin-resistant S6K1 in
rapamycin-treated U373 and U251 provided partial rescue.
Consistent with the latter observation, small interfering RNA–
mediated suppression of S6K1 in HRasV12-transformed human
astrocytes, U251, and U373 cells resulted in a significant loss of
anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, we found that
in vivo short hairpin RNA–mediated suppression of S6K1 in
HRasV12-transformed human astrocytes reduced intracranial
tumor size, in association with reduced tumor levels of
phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. These findings implicate the mTOR-S6K pathway as a critical mediator of glial cell
transformation. [Cancer Res 2008;68(16):6516–23]

Introduction
The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an ATP and
nutrient sensor that contributes to the control of cell size and cell
cycle progression. mTOR’s ability to control cell size and cell cycle
is due at least in part to its ability to regulate the translation of
specific classes of mRNAs. mTOR-mediated control of translation
is a rapamycin-sensitive process accomplished by regulation of the
downstream targets, S6K and eIF4E (1–3). mTOR phosphorylates
S6K, leading to the phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6
and subsequent increased translation of mRNA with 5¶ terminal
oligopyrimidine sequences (2). In contrast, inhibition of eIF4E by
the translational repressor 4EBP1 is reversed when 4EBP1 is
phosphorylated by mTOR, resulting in the release of eIF4E, which

can associate with eIF4A, eIF4G, and eIF4B to initiate the
translation of capped mRNA (4).
The rapamycin-sensitive translational functions mediated by
S6K and 4EBP1 have recently been recognized to be a result of
mTOR’s interaction with raptor to form the mTORC1 complex,
whereas rapamycin-insensitive functions are a result of mTOR’s
interaction with rictor, forming mTORC2 (5–9). It remains to be
determined how regulation of mTOR by raptor and rictor is
coordinated, although each seems to control distinct and mutually
exclusive mTOR functions. mTORC1, but not mTORC2, activates
S6K, which can then inhibit insulin receptor substrate-I (IRS-1),
thereby limiting insulin receptor–mediated signaling through
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K). mTORC2, in contrast, has
recently been shown to phosphorylate PKB at Ser473, thereby
functioning as a PDK-2 (7).
Substantial indirect evidence indicates that mTOR fulfills a
central role in tumor development and maintenance. Oncogenic
signaling through a variety of molecules, such as the epidermal
growth factor receptor, Ras, and PI3K, can up-regulate mTOR
activity and promote neoplastic growth (10). Tumors lacking
normal Akt control mechanisms have also been shown to be
particularly vulnerable to mTOR inhibition (11) and evidence of
elevated mTOR activity can be found in multiple types of tumors
(12), including malignant gliomas (13). These findings have led to
the idea that mTOR plays a role in tumor maintenance, and to the
development of mTOR inhibitors as systemic therapy against a
wide range of malignancies.
Despite evidence of a link between mTOR, S6K, and eIF4E in
response to growth factor activation, it is unclear whether S6K
and/or eIF4E connect mTOR to tumor development and growth.
Evidence from model systems has implicated eIF4E and S6K in
tumor development in specific oncogenic contexts. For example,
overexpression of eIF4E has been shown to transform rat
fibroblasts in cooperation with v-myc or E1A, and in vivo eIF4E
overexpression causes the development of lymphomas, angiosarcomas, lung adenocarcinomas, and hepatocellular adenomas
(14–17). Inhibition of cap-binding by eIF4E also suppresses
eIF4E-driven transformation (15). Although S6K has not been
described as an oncoprotein, phosphorylated S6 protein levels are
elevated in various tumor types, including malignant glioma
(13, 18), and translational targets of S6K such as HIF1a seem to
be critical in supporting tumor growth (19). Tumors with elevated
HIF1 are sensitive to mTOR inhibition, and expression of HIF1a
5¶-TOP sequences confers sensitivity to the mTOR inhibitor
CCI-779 (20). Recent data also indicates that inhibition of
angiogenesis by the tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia
protein is in part dependent on its ability to inhibit mTOR and
the synthesis of HIF1a (21). Although these data suggest that
eIF4E and S6K may directly mediate transformation through
mTOR, amplification or mutation of eIF4E or S6K has not been
found in spontaneously arising tumors, nor is mTOR itself thought
to be an oncogene. Thus, the contribution of eIF4E and S6K to
mTOR-dependent glial transformation remains open.

S6K1 Plays a Key Role in Glial Transformation

In order to test whether mTOR-dependent transformation
requires both eIF4E and S6K functions, we genetically and
pharmacologically manipulated mTOR and its downstream effectors and monitored its effects on the transformation status of
human glioma cell lines and transformed human astrocytes. We
found that suppression of mTOR or raptor was sufficient to
significantly reduce anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, an
assay of transformation. Furthermore, S6K1, but not eIF4E, rescued
glioma growth in soft agar from rapamycin-mediated suppression,
and transient S6K1 inhibition was sufficient to significantly reduce
glioma growth in soft agar. In vivo S6K1 suppression in
intracranially implanted glioma xenografts reduced levels of
phosphorylated S6 and also resulted in reduced intracranial tumor
growth. This data is the first direct demonstration of S6K’s
importance in supporting tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo.
Collectively, these findings define a significant role for the mTORraptor (mTORC1)-S6K pathway in supporting gliomagenesis.

Materials and Methods
Cells and cell culture. Human glioma cell lines were obtained from
the Brain Tumor Research Center Tissue Bank at the University of
California, San Francisco. Immortalized human astrocytes and HRasV12and HRasV12/Akt-transformed human astrocytes (E6/E7/hTert, E6/E7/
hTert/HRasV12 and E6/E7/hTert/HRasV12/Akt, respectively) were generated as previously described (22, 23). All cell lines were grown in DMEM
(4,500 mg/L glucose; Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Life Technologies, Invitrogen), penicillin, and streptomycin.
Cells were grown in a humidified incubator containing 8% carbon
dioxide at 37jC.
Proliferation assay. To assess cell proliferation, the 3-(4-5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium
salt (MTS) assay was used (CellTiter96; Promega). Cells were plated in triplicate into 96-well plates at a concentration of 2,000 cells/well (100 AL/well).
At specified time points, 20 AL of MTS reagent were added to each well and
allowed to incubate for 1 h. Absorbance (490 nm) was then determined in a
96-well plate reader.
Plasmids, transfection, and selection of cells. A pCAN1 vector
encoding wt-eIF4E was a gift from Frank McCormick (University of
California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA). To generate a construct
permitting wt-eIF4E expression with a unique selectable marker in E6/E7/
hTert/HRasV12 and E6/E7/hTert/HRasV12/Akt cells, wt-eIF4E was subcloned
from pCAN1-wt-eIF4E into the retroviral vector pMXI, which encodes green
fluorescent protein (GFP) as a marker. Subcloning was performed as
follows: pCAN1-wt-eIF4E was digested with XhoI and EcoRI, followed by gel
purification of the wt-eIF4E encoding insert and ligation of the insert into
identically digested pMXI. The retroviral pBABE constructs encoding wildtype S6K1 or rapamycin-resistant S6K (pBABE/F5A-E389) were gifts from
John Blenis (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Retroviral vectors were
used to infect cells as previously described (22). Small interfering RNA
(siRNA) targeting S6K1 (Ambion), 4EBP1 (Ambion), and control scramble
sequence (Ambion) were transfected using FUGENE 6 (Roche). Monolayer
cells, grown to f80% confluence, were exposed to retroviral supernatants
with 8 Ag/mL of polybrene. Pools of productively infected cells (obtained by
selection with puromycin or hygromycin) were used for further analyses.
Cells expressing GFP were separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) on a FACSVantage sorter (Becton Dickinson) located in the UCSF
Laboratory for Cell Analysis at a band-pass filter of 530/30 nm. Sorting gates
were set such that 99% of the negative population and <1% of the positive
population were excluded from the collection. Pooled collected cells were
used for further analyses.
Lentiviral production and infection. Lentiviral short hairpin RNAs
(shRNA) targeting mTOR (6) was obtained from Addgene, Inc. The
lentivirus was packaged by cotransfection of 293T cells with the shRNA
expression vector, vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein, and D-VPR

www.aacrjournals.org

plasmids at a ratio of 1:0.9:0.1, using FUGENE 6 (Roche). Forty-eight hours
after transfection, the supernatants containing lentiviral particles were
harvested. Monolayer cells, grown to f80% confluence, were exposed to the
above lentiviral supernatants in the presence of 8 Ag/mL of polybrene for
48 h, followed by selection with 2 Ag/mL of puromycin for 1 week. After
antibiotic selection, pools of productively infected cells were used for
further analyses.
S6K1 was silenced in a tetracycline-inducible fashion by cloning a 97mer
hairpin oligonucleotide targeting the S6K1 transcript into the pPRIME Tetinducible construct (24). The following sequence was used to generate
shRNA targeting S6K1: forward 5¶-CCCCTGTCAGCCCAGTCAAATTTTCAAGAGAAATTTGACTGGGCTGACAG TTTTT-3¶, reverse 3¶-GGGGACAGTCGGGTCAGTTTAAAAGTTCTCTTTAAACTGACCCGACTTCAAAAA-5¶.
This sequence was cloned into pPRIME Tet-GFP-FF3 (a kind gift from
Stephen J. Elledge, Harvard University) producing pPRIME Tet-GFP-S6K1
(SCT). The cloning product was confirmed by sequencing, virus was
generated as described above, and 293T cells were infected with either
pPRIME Tet-GFP-FF3 (targeting firefly luciferase, 8 Ag of vesicular
stomatitis virus-glycoprotein, 8 Ag of pCMV, and 16 Ag of lentiviral vector,
and used as a negative control) or pPRIME Tet-GFP-SCT. Viral supernatant
was concentrated using Centricon Plus-20 filters (Millipore), then added to
HRasV12-transformed human astrocytes. After 4 days of incubation, infected
cells were sorted for GFP expression, and this GFP-positive pooled
population was maintained in standard culture conditions described above.
Doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) at 5 Ag/mL in standard medium was added to
induce the expression of shRNA in culture.
Soft agar colony formation assay. As previously described (22), cells
(1  104) were plated in DMEM plus 10% FCS in 0.35% (w/v) low-melting
temperature agar between layers of 0.7% low-melting temperature agar.
After 3 weeks, colonies were stained with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich) and colonies of >50 cells
were scored by counting under a microscope. All experiments were
performed at least in quadruplicate.
Animal injection. Immunodeficient rats (rnu/rnu; National Cancer
Institute) were injected intracranially as described previously (22) with
HRasV12-transformed human astrocytes expressing either control lentivirus
(Ras Tet) or SCT (Ras SCT). Three days after injection, animals were fed
either LabDiet 5053 or LabDiet 5053 (Purina) supplemented with
doxycycline at 6,000 ppm daily. After 14 days of exposure to doxycycline
or control feed, animals were sacrificed, perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and brains were fixed in paraformaldehyde and paraffin-embedded.
Immunoblot analysis. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer [150 mmol/L
NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1% NP40, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L
EGTA, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture
(Boehringer Mannheim, Co.)] at 4jC. Lysate was centrifuged (12,000  g )
for 10 min at 4jC to remove insoluble components. Protein was quantitated
by the Bio-Rad Dc protein assay. Equal amounts of protein were separated
on SDS-PAGE 12% to 16% gels, then transferred to Immobilon-P
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was
blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The
membrane was then incubated with primary antibody in TBST, followed by
secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase diluted in TBST. ECL
Detection System for Western blot Analysis (Amersham) was used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions for antibody detection. An
AlphaImager 2000 Documentation and Analysis System (Multi Image
light cabinet photodensitometer) was used to quantify the appropriate
bands (Alpha Innotech Corporation). Primary antibodies used were antiraptor, anti-mTOR, anti-S6K, anti–phosphorylated p70S6K Thr389, antiphosphorylated S6 Ser235/236 (all from Cell Signaling), and anti–a-tubulin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Immunohistochemistry. Five-micrometer sections were obtained
through paraffin-embedded brain tumors at intervals of 500 Am. Sections
were stained with H&E, and the maximum cross-sectional dimension of the
tumor was measured under a microscope by an observer blinded to
treatment. The maximal tumor area was calculated on each consecutive
slide through the tumors and summed for each tumor. Phosphorylated S6
Ser235/236 (Cell Signaling) was assessed on paraffin-embedded sections using

levels suppresses soft agar colony
formation. A, U251 and U373 cells were
infected with lentivirus encoding either a
scrambled shRNA (scr) or shRNA targeting
mTOR (shmTOR ). After antibiotic

for levels of mTOR, phosphorylated

captured and merged using Openlab (Improvision).
Statistics. Statistical analyses were performed using the GB-STAT
statistical package (Dynamic Microsystems). Standard errors were calculated for each mean, and statistical differences between groups were
determined by Student’s t test or ANOVA followed by Newman-Keul post

Results
Anchorage-independent growth of human glioma cells is
dependent on mTOR-raptor signaling. Anchorage-dependent
growth by tumors displaying activated PKB/Akt signaling, such as
those lacking PTEN, is sensitive to mTOR inhibition (11), although
mTOR’s role in maintaining anchorage-independent growth is less
well defined. We used the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin to assess
whether the anchorage-independent growth of two human glioma
cell lines and two transformed human astrocytic cell lines was
mTOR-dependent. Immortalized human astrocytes transformed by

the expression of HRasV12 or HRasV12/Akt grew in soft agar as did
the U251 and U373 glioblastoma cell lines. The addition of
rapamycin in the agar, however, suppressed the colony-forming
ability of all cells (data not shown). The anchorage-independent
growth of HRasV12/Akt-transformed human astrocytes was also no
more resistant to rapamycin than that of human astrocytes
transformed by HRasV12 alone, indicating that activated Akt failed
to rescue anchorage-independent growth from suppression by
rapamycin.
To confirm these results, we also determined whether specific
suppression of mTOR altered the growth of glioma cell lines in soft
agar. To do so, we stably introduced lentivirus encoding shRNA
targeting mTOR in U251 and U373, then assessed levels of mTOR
and the downstream effectors phosphorylated p70S6K Thr389 and
phosphorylated Akt Ser473 by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A,
shRNA targeting mTOR selectively suppressed mTOR levels in both
cell lines, leading to decreased phosphorylated p70S6K Thr389
levels. Consistent with prior observations, we also observed a

concomitant increase in phosphorylated Akt Ser473 (26). Although
suppression of mTOR in cell lines did not significantly alter the
proliferation rates of cells in culture (Fig. 1B), it did suppress the
growth of cells in soft agar (relative to scramble control) to an
extent comparable to the loss of growth observed with rapamycin
exposure (Fig. 1C). These results show that mTOR plays a key role
in maintaining anchorage-independent growth and transformation
in glioma cells.
eIF4E expression fails to reverse rapamycin-mediated
suppression of anchorage-independent growth. Because eIF4E
has been shown to play a role in the transformation of 3T3 cells
and in leukemogenesis, we expressed wild-type eIF4E in HRasV12transformed human astrocytes, HRasV12/Akt-transformed human
astrocytes, and U373 cells, then assessed the ability of eIF4E to
alter the effects of rapamycin on growth in soft agar. As shown in
Fig. 2A, retroviral infection of HRasV12, HRasV12/Akt-transformed
human astrocytes, and U373 cells increased eIF4E expression
relative to vector control cells. eIF4E expression in HRasV12/Akttransformed human astrocytes significantly increased colony
formation in the absence of rapamycin relative to vector control
cells (Fig. 2B). eIF4E expression did not, however, reverse
rapamycin-mediated suppression of colony formation in soft agar

(Fig. 2B). In contrast to the effects of eIF4E expression in HRasV12transformed human astrocytes, eIF4E expression in U373 did not
alter baseline soft agar colony formation. However, as in the above
cell lines, eIF4E expression in U373 failed to confer resistance to
rapamycin exposure. These data indicate that whereas eIF4E
introduction confers a growth advantage, it does not rescue cells
from rapamycin-induced suppression of growth in soft agar.
eIF4E function is negatively regulated by 4EBP1, and we further
substantiated the above finding by silencing 4EBP1 in HRasV12transformed human astrocytes and U251 using siRNA (Fig. 2C),
then assessing the ability of 4EBP1 to alter the effects of rapamycin
on growth in soft agar. Reduction of 4EBP1 levels in both cell lines
failed to rescue cells from the effects of rapamycin in soft agar
(Fig. 2D ), providing further support that eIF4E does not
significantly support mTOR-driven growth by gliomas.
S6K supports anchorage-independent growth. S6K has been
shown to modulate the translation of messages possessing 5¶-TOP
sequences, but has not been implicated in tumorigenesis. To
directly address the role of S6K in transformation, we expressed
wild-type S6K, or a constitutively active, rapamycin-resistant
mutant S6K (E389R) in U373 and U251, then assessed its effects
on growth in soft agar with and without rapamycin present. As

Figure 2. Neither eIF4E expression nor 4EPBP1 suppression are sufficient to rescue anchorage-independent growth from rapamycin. A, human astrocytes
transformed by HRasV12, or HRasV12/Akt, and human glioma U373 cells were infected with either an empty vector encoding GFP or vector encoding GFP and
wild-type eIF4E. After cells were FACS-sorted to isolate GFP-positive cells, whole cell lysate from the cell lines were assessed by immunoblotting for total eIF4E
protein. Equal loading was verified by a-tubulin. B, cells expressing either wild-type eIF4E or empty vector were plated in soft agar in the presence or absence of
100 nmol/L of rapamycin, then after 3 wk of incubation, cells were stained and colonies were counted. Columns, mean number of colonies produced per cell line; bars,

total 4EBP1 and a-tubulin. D, cells transfected with either i4EBP1 or scramble control were plated in soft agar 24 h after transfection (in the absence or presence
of rapamycin) and scored for colony numbers after 3 wk of incubation. Columns, mean proportion of colonies produced per cell line, normalized to untreated controls;

shown in Fig. 3A, introduction of a vector encoding wild-type or
constitutively activated S6K (E389R) increased levels of S6K and
phosphorylated S6 Ser235/236 2-fold to 3-fold in both cell lines
relative to empty vector cells (pBabe). Having confirmed protein
expression in viral transfectants, pooled transfectants were grown
in soft agar in the presence or absence of rapamycin, and colonies
were counted after 3 weeks. As shown in Fig. 3B, colony formation
by U251 cells expressing wild-type S6K remained sensitive to
rapamycin exposure, whereas colony formation by U251 cells
expressing the mutant S6K E389R was resistant to the presence of
rapamycin. In U373 cells, expression of either wild-type S6K or the
mutant S6K E389R resulted in partial rescue of soft agar colony
formation in the presence of rapamycin, as compared with the
empty vector (Fig. 3B). The reduced expression of wild-type S6K,
compared with the expression of mutant S6K E389R in the U251
cells, may explain the absence of rescue from rapamycin-mediated
suppression of soft agar growth that was observed in the U251 as
compared with the U373 cells which, in comparison, had more
comparable protein levels of the wild-type and mutant forms of
S6K. To further assess S6K’s importance in maintaining a transformed state, we performed the converse experiment by transiently
transfecting U373, U251, and HRasV12-transformed human astrocytes with siRNA targeting S6K1, plating cells 24 hours after
transfection into soft agar and monitoring colony formation
3 weeks later. As shown in Fig. 4A, siRNA transfection produced
an f50% to 70% reduction of total S6K1 protein levels in all three
cell lines by 96 hours after transfection, and a 50% to 70% reduction
in phosphorylated S6 Ser235/236 levels. Cells transfected with siRNA
targeting S6K1 grew to confluence at a similar rate as cells
transfected with scramble control (data not shown). Consistent
with the idea that S6K1 maintains anchorage-independent growth,
however, S6K1 suppression was associated with a significant loss of
colony formation in soft agar by U373, U251, and HRasV12transformed human astrocytes (Fig. 4B).
Because transient S6K1 knockdown significantly reduced
anchorage-independent growth in all three cell lines tested, we
sought to determine whether S6K1 knockdown in vivo could
similarly inhibit tumor growth. However, concerns regarding the
appropriateness of transient RNAi, as performed above, for in vivo
studies of orthotopic xenografts led us to favor a more stable and
inducible system for RNAi-based experiments. To confirm our
in vitro findings, we constructed a lentiviral construct encoding
shRNA targeting S6K1 in a tetracycline-inducible fashion and
expressed either this construct or control vector into HRasV12transformed human astrocytes. Pooled cells expressing the
constructs were isolated by FACS for GFP expression, and
tetracycline-inducible iS6K1 was confirmed in vitro (Fig. 5A).
HRasV12-transformed human astrocytes expressing either control
vector (Ras Tet) or vector targeting S6K1 (Ras SCT) were injected
intracranially into rats. Based on previously described formulations
for doxycycline-impregnated rodent feed (27), mice were exposed
to either control feed or feed containing doxycycline. After a 14-day
exposure to either control feed or feed containing doxycycline,
animals were sacrificed and brains were fixed, sectioned and
stained with H&E. We then assessed in vivo phosphorylated S6
Ser235/236 levels by immunohistochemistry, and found that Ras SCT
and Ras Tet tumors showed comparable levels of cytoplasmic
phosphorylated S6 in the presence of control feed (Fig. 5B).
Although exposure to doxycycline failed to alter levels of
cytoplasmic phosphorylated S6 in Ras Tet tumors, Ras SCT tumors
exposed to doxycycline had comparatively reduced cytoplasmic

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (16). August 15, 2008

phosphorylated S6 (Fig. 5A). Animals injected with Ras SCT tumors
and receiving doxycycline feed developed smaller tumors as
compared with control animals (Fig. 5C, P < 0.05, Student’s t test).
Similar to the degree of reduced soft agar colony formation after
iS6K shown in Fig. 4B, we observed f50% smaller tumors in the
animals injected with Ras SCT tumor cells and receiving
doxycycline feed relative to controls. These data indicate that
HRasV12-transformed human astrocytes showed significant cytoplasmic levels of phosphorylated S6 in vivo, and suggest that S6K1
knockdown occurred in a doxycycline-dependent manner. These
results show that maintenance of S6K1 activity supports HRasV12
transformation in vivo, and that loss of S6K1 activity compromises
tumor growth.

A, U251 and U373 were transfected with either empty vector (pBabe ), or
vector encoding wild-type S6K1 (wt S6K ), or constitutively active S6K1 (S6K
E389R ). After selection, whole cell lysates from each cell line were assessed by
immunoblotting for total S6K, phosphorylated S6 Ser235/236, and a-tubulin.
Equal loading was verified by a-tubulin. B, U251 and U373 expressing wild-type
S6K, constitutively active S6K E389R, or empty vector (pBabe) were plated
in soft agar in the presence of rapamycin, and after 3 wk of incubation, cells
were stained and colonies were counted. Columns, mean number of colonies

Discussion
mTOR and its downstream effectors, eIF4E and S6K, have been
implicated in cellular transformation, although their contribution to
glial transformation remains undefined. In this work, we show that
growth of glioma cells in soft agar, a stringent assay for
transformation, is blocked by down-regulation of mTORC1 and that
signaling through S6K, but not eIF4E, maintains glial transformation. We also show that in vivo suppression of S6K results in reduced
intracranial glioma growth. These findings indicate that the S6K arm
may have special significance in glial transformation.
Our data suggest that mTORC2 function is less significant in
mTOR-dependent anchorage-independent growth for a few reasons.
Rapamycin has been reported to have alternate effects on Akt
phosphorylation; prolonged rapamycin exposure has been shown to
inhibit the assembly of mTORC2, thereby inhibiting Akt (28), and
mTOR inhibition has also been described to induce IRS-1, leading to
Akt activation (26). In the human glioma cell lines U251 and U373, we
found that suppression of mTOR resulted in a significant increase in
phosphorylated Akt Ser473 as compared with cells expressing
scramble control. Despite the increase in phosphorylated Akt
Ser473, mTOR knockdown nonetheless significantly compromised
these cells’ anchorage-independent growth. These data suggest that
in gliomas, mTORC2 is not the dominant arm supporting mTORdependent transformation, although it is possible that mTORC2 has
effects on tumorigenesis that are Akt-independent.
Our data also suggest that S6K and eIF4E have distinct roles in
gliomagenesis. Although prior findings have shown that eIF4E
transforms rat fibroblasts, we found that eIF4E expression in U373
glioma cells and HRasV12- and HRasV12/Akt-transformed human
astrocytes failed to restore anchorage-independent growth in the
setting of mTOR inhibition. Silencing 4EBP1 also failed to rescue
anchorage-independent growth from rapamycin-mediated suppres-

sion. eIF4E overexpression, however, increased colony formation in
HRasV12/Akt-transformed human astrocytes, suggesting that eIF4E
plays a positive role in transformation, and it is possible that eIF4E’s
effects on transformation require other mTOR-dependent pathways
such as S6K1. Another reason we cannot fully exclude a role by eIF4E
in glial transformation is that superphysiologic levels of eIF4E
beyond the 2-fold to 4-fold increases generated in this study may be
required for transformation. Malignant gliomas have been described
immunohistochemically to express more eIF4E as compared with
normal neuroglial cells (29), although the degree of eIF4E overexpression in malignant gliomas remains undefined.
Although S6K has not been shown to be an oncoprotein, in the
human gliomas assessed in this study, S6K seemed to be a key
factor in maintaining anchorage-independent growth. The actions
of S6K shown in human astrocytes may indicate that S6K has
differing roles in various tissue types: for example, S6K1 deletion
blocks growth factor–stimulated hypertrophy in muscle but not
in neurons (30). S6K has numerous downstream targets, among
them mRNAs with 5¶-TOP sequences, the protein products of
which are starting to be understood. The critical targets of S6K
are not well defined, although the present data clearly suggest
that these targets may be distinct from those influenced by eIF4E,
and may represent better therapeutic targets. It should be noted
that whereas the mTOR-S6K pathway seems to be critical for the
growth of cells in soft agar, transformation of glial cells requires a
series of events (p53 inactivation, retinoblastoma inactivation,
telomerase reactivation, Ras activation) to which the mTOR-S6K
pathway is merely a contributor (22, 31). This observation is
consistent with the finding that supplying S6K to rapamycintreated cells only partially rescues growth. The present findings
suggest that S6K, but not eIF4E, plays a key, although not
sufficient, role in glial transformation.

In addition to our data, which shows an important role for S6K1 in
supporting gliomagenesis in vitro and in vivo, recently published data
describe ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) as supporting anchorageindependent growth induced by tumor-promoting agents such as
epidermal growth factor and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
(32). RSK2, a homologue of S6K1, is similarly activated by mitogens
and is inhibited by rapamycin (33). Although both RSK2 and S6K1
phosphorylate S6 in vivo, these kinases do not seem to be
functionally redundant for a few reasons. S6K1 knockout mice have
a small-body phenotype, despite the finding that mouse embryo
fibroblasts from these animals show normal S6 phosphorylation
in vivo, suggesting that RSK2 does not completely duplicate
S6K1’s functions (34). Comparisons of amino acid sequences and
localization between the two S6 kinases also suggest distinct
functional differences (33, 35). It remains possible that S6K1 and
RSK2 support tumor growth through similar mechanisms, and

further studies defining the transformation-promoting effects
common or specific to these kinases are needed.
Defining the role of the mTOR-S6K pathway in glial transformation may have an effect on the design and implementation of glioma
therapies. Current targeted therapies are based on our knowledge of
pathways thought to be critical for tumorigenesis and proliferation.
This rationale has led to the clinical testing of signaling inhibitors
such as Tarceva and CCI-779. Despite this mechanistic approach to
drug development, these agents have shown only modest effects, and
combinatorial strategies that inhibit multiple kinases ( for example
PI3K or Akt in combination with mTOR) show more promise than
strategies employing single kinase inhibition (36, 37). In the case of
Akt/mTOR combinatorial therapy, the fact that mTOR inhibition
can induce Akt activation through IRS-1 may explain why targeting
the same pathway at multiple sites is associated with better efficacy.
Concerns have been raised that Akt activation with mTORC1

Figure 5. Reduction of S6K1 reduces tumor growth in vivo. A, short hairpin sequence targeting firefly luciferase (control ) or S6K1 in a tetracycline-inducible lentiviral
construct was expressed in HRasV12-transformed human astrocytes (Ras ). Cells were exposed to medium containing vehicle alone or doxycycline (5 Ag/mL) for
4 d. Whole cell lysate from treated cells were assessed by immunoblotting for levels of phosphorylated S6 Ser235/236. Equal loading was verified by a-tubulin.
B, HRasV12-transformed human astrocytes expressing either control vector (Ras Tet ) or vector targeting S6K1 (Ras SCT) were injected intracranially in rats. After
a 14-d exposure to either control feed or feed containing doxycycline ( DOX or +DOX ), animals were sacrificed and brains were fixed and sectioned. Representative
5-Am sections through tumors were immunolabeled for phosphorylated S6 Ser235/236 and stained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI ). Fluorescence
microscopy was used to visualize 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue ) and phosphorylated S6 Ser235/236 (green ). Images were taken at 20 magnification, and
individual channels are displayed. C, 5-Am-thick coronal sections were taken at 0.5-mm intervals through the entire tumor, then stained with H&E. Columns, sum

inhibition could represent a mechanism for drug resistance and
sustained tumor growth, although in our model, Akt activation did
not rescue tumor growth from mTORC1 inhibition. Our observation
that the mTOR-S6K pathway plays a key role in glial transformation
suggests that targeting the Akt-mTOR-S6K pathway at a more distal
point may be as effective as dual inhibition at a more proximal point.
Selective S6K inhibitors are, at present, not available at the clinical or
preclinical level, although the present study suggest that such agents,
alone or in combination with other agents, might be rational choices
for glioma therapy, and perhaps other tumors dependent on mTORS6K signaling for maintenance of the transformed phenotype.
