Abstract

Author Manuscript

Replication fork (RF) maintenance pathways preserve chromosomes, but their faulty application at
nonallelic repeats could generate rearrangements causing cancer, genomic disorders and
speciation1-3. Potential causal mechanisms are homologous recombination (HR) and error-free
postreplication repair (EF-PRR). HR repairs damage induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs)
and single-ended DSBs within replication. To facilitate HR, the recombinase RAD51 and
mediator BRCA2 form a filament on the 3’ DNA strand at a break to enable annealing to the
complementary sister chromatid4 while the RecQ helicase, BLM (Bloom syndrome mutated)
suppresses crossing over to prevent recombination5. HR also stabilizes6,7 and restarts8,9 RFs
without a DSB10,11. EF-PRR bypasses DNA incongruities that impede replication by
ubiquitinating PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) using the RAD6/RAD18 and UBC13/
MMS2/RAD5 ubiquitin ligase complexes12. Some components are common to both HR and EFPRR like RAD51 and RAD1813,14. Here we delineate two pathways that spontaneously fuse
inverted repeats to generate unstable chromosomal rearrangements in wild type mouse embryonic
stem (ES) cells. Gamma-radiation induced a BLM-regulated pathway that selectively fused
identical, but not mismatched repeats. By contrast, UV light induced a RAD18-dependent pathway
that efficiently fused mismatched repeats. Furthermore, TREX2 (a 3’→5’ exonuclease)
suppressed identical repeat fusion but enhanced mismatched repeat fusion, clearly separating these

pathways. TREX2 associated with UBC13 and enhanced PCNA ubiquitination in response to UV
light, consistent with it being a novel member of EF-PRR. RAD18 and TREX2 also suppressed
RF stalling in response to nucleotide depletion. Interestingly, RF stalling induced fusion for
identical and mismatched repeats implicating faulty replication as a causal mechanism for both
pathways.

Author Manuscript

The identical and mismatched repeat reporters (IRR & MRR, Fig. 1a, b) were designed to
investigate pathways that rearrange chromosomes through repeat fusion. Both reporters
contain a 313bp major satellite repeat (MSR) at each junction of an inversion in miniHPRT.
These repeats are indirect so repeat fusion restores miniHPRT to enable survival in HAT
selection media by a potential mechanism shown in figure 1c. The only difference between
these reporters is the MRR’s 3’ repeat contains seven mismatches with the longest
contiguous homology being 67 bases. The IRR and MRR were stably transfected into wild
type AB2.2 and IB10 ES cells. About the same number of HAT-resistant colonies
spontaneously grew for both reporters (Fig. 1d, p>0.85, student T-test) indicating
spontaneous repeat fusion occurred in wild type cells.
The fused 5’ repeat for the MRR was sequenced to determine the switch location (Fig. 1e,
Extend data Fig. 1). Strand exchange in fission yeast predominately occurred at the
palindrome center after RFs were induced to stall, an event called a U turn9. We found six of
14 switches exhibited this U-turn at the base of a putative hairpin (all green), while two
occurred at the apex (all orange) and six occurred in the stem (green-orange). Thus, strand
exchange occurred at multiple locations.

It is possible the switched strand replicated to the telomere forming a dipericentric (Fig. 1c).
Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed on clones with the IRR
and MRR using a pericentromeric and telomeric probe. Dipericentrics and chromosomes
with extra pericentromeres and telomeres (EPTs)15 were observed for cells with both
reporters (Extended data Fig. 2a, Extended data Tables 1, 2). EPTs appeared unstable since
the pericentromere number and location varied between metaphase spreads from the same
clone implicating secondary events consistent with breakage-fusion-bridge cycles16.
Spectral karyotyping (SKY) on three MRR clones showed multiple fusion points confirming
rearrangement complexity (Extended data Table 3). Duplications of chromosome 1 (Fig.
1f1) and translocations between chromosomes 14 and 11 (Fig. 1f2) or 14 and 13 were
frequently observed from the same clone and even in the same metaphase spread implicating
a role in genome topology17. Two-color FISH was performed on a single clone (clone 18
from Extended data Tables 2 and 3) with the MRR probe and either chromosome 1 or 14.
This analysis revealed unstable structures since the MRR could be found at either
chromosomes 1 or 14 (Extended data Fig. 2b) implicating faulty DNA synthesis18.
Furthermore, the MRR pattern changed from a discrete dot to multiple dots interspersed
with chromosomal sequences similar to segmental duplications described during
evolution19. Thus, both reporters caused unstable and complex rearrangements, yet the
causal pathways are not known.
Complex genomic rearrangements could manifest from faulty chromosome maintenance.
Therefore, we tested if γ-radiation or UV light enhanced repeat fusion for wild type AB2.2

cells with the IRR or MRR. Exposure to 4 Gy γ-radiation induced repeat fusion for the IRR
(Fig. 2a left, p=0.017, student T test) but not the MRR (Fig. 2a right, p=0.16) while
exposure to 20 J/m2 UV light had the opposite effect on the IRR (Fig. 2b left, p=0.35) and
MRR (Fig. 2b right, p=0.006). This contrast suggests different pathways fused identical and
mismatched repeats.

We tested if HR proteins fused identical repeats since HR corrects damage caused by γradiation but not UV light4. We tested BLM-defective ES cells (blmtm3Brd/tm4Brd, simply
called blm-/-)20 since BLM regulates HR through Holliday junction dissolution5. Repeat
fusion was significantly higher in blm-/- cells as compared to AB2.2 cells for the IRR (Fig.
2c, compare 1 & 2, p<0.0001), but not the MRR (Fig. 2c, compare 6 & 7, p=0.47). Next we
tested blm-/- cells haploinsufficient for RAD51 or BRCA2 since BRCA2 enables RAD51
filament formation on DNA single stands to mediate strand annealing and Holliday junction
formation. We found blm-/- Rad51+/Δex2-4 cells (Extended data Fig. 3) and blm-/brca2+/Δex27-n cells (Extended data Fig. 4a) exhibited reduced repeat fusion (Fig. 2c,
compare 2 to 3 & 4, p<0.0001). Deleting the remaining Brca2 exon 27 copy (Extended data
Fig. 4b) further reduced repeat fusion (Fig. 2c, compare 4 & 5, p=0.049). Thus, BLM
suppressed RAD51/BRCA2-mediated identical repeat fusion consistent with an HR-based
pathway (these data do not address RAD51/BRCA2’s potential role in mismatch repeat
fusion).

Author Manuscript

We tested if EF-PRR fused mismatched repeats since UV light, but not γ-radiation, induced
PCNA ubiquitination in mammalian cells21. IB10 ES cells deleted for RAD1822 were
analyzed. These cells exhibited modestly lower levels of repeat fusion for the IRR as
compared to IB10 control cells (Fig. 2d, compare 1 & 2, p=0.06). This reduction could
reflect RAD18’s nonessential participation in HR14. By contrast RAD18-deletion
significantly lowered fusion of mismatched repeats (Fig. 2d, compare 3 & 4, p=0.0005). The
reduction of mismatched repeat fusion is greater than identical repeat fusion (p<0.0001)
demonstrating RAD18’s role in fusing mismatched repeats is more prominent than identical
repeats. These results are consistent with EF-PRR fusing mismatched repeats. Yet, RAD18
is an E3 ubiquitin ligase so it could have broad function; therefore, mutations in other genes
in the poorly understood EF-PRR pathway should be observed.

TREX2 could be a novel member of EF-PRR. Previously, we analyzed trex2null cells and
cells that expressed wild type human TREX2 (TREX2WT) and human TREX2 mutated in the
catalytic domain (TREX2H188A) and DNA binding domain (TREX2R167A, ~85 reduction in
DNA binding)23,24. We found TREX2 deletion elevated levels of spontaneous isochromatid
breaks and chromosomal rearrangements24,25. TREX2WT rescued the null phenotype while
TREX2H188A exacerbated this phenotype suggesting a dominant effect24. These
observations suggested defective DSB repair. However, trex2null cells exhibited increased
DSB repair and normal BLM-regulated sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs)26. Therefore, we
hypothesized TREX2 did not repair DSBs but instead suppressed DSB formation through an
unknown pathway, possibly EF-PRR. In support, trex2null cells displayed reduced levels of
spontaneous SCEs26,27.

TREX2-altered cells were tested for fusion of identical and mismatched repeats. trex2null
and TREX2H188A expressing cells exhibited elevated levels of identical repeat fusion as
compared to control cells (AB2.2 and Trex2hTX2 cells) (Fig. 2e, compare 1 & 3 to 2 & 4
p<0.05) corroborating our previous observations that HR is elevated in trex2null cells and
that an HR-based pathway fuses identical repeats. A similar anti-recombination effect on
identical repeats was seen for the 3’ exonucleases Exo1 and ExoVII in E. coli suggesting 3’
exonuclease activity inhibits these fusions28. We also found trex2null and TREX2H188A
expressing cells exhibited very low levels of mismatch repeat fusion as compared to AB2.2,
Trex2hTX2 and Trex2R167A cells (Fig. 2f, compare 1, 3 & 4 to 2 & 5 p<0.0006). Furthermore,
TREX2 mediated UV light-induced fusion of mismatched repeats (Fig. 2b right panel,
p=0.003). These data clearly separate the pathways that mediate identical and mismatch
repeat fusion and demonstrate sequence identity determined pathway choice. These data also
demonstrate the importance of TREX2’s catalytic activity in mediating repeat fusion.
Exonuclease activity would predictably remove intermediate 3’ mismatches or flaps that
could occur at the DNA incongruity or during strand exchange and strand displacement.
Furthermore, these data are consistent with TREX2 being part of the EF-PRR machinery.

Author Manuscript

Three experiments were performed to test if TREX2 is a member of EF-PRR. First, TREX2
located to the nascent replication strand after UV light exposure (Extended data Fig. 5a);
thus, it was at the right place at the right time. Second, TREX2 associated with UBC13, but
not MMS2, by GST pull down (Extended data Fig. 5b); UBC13/MMS2 is the E2
heterodimer that polyubiquitinates PCNA12,21. In addition, TREX2 associated with UBC13
after ectopic expression in HeLa cells that was enhanced by UV light (Extended data Fig.
5c); thus, it associated with the PCNA ubiquitination machinery. Third, we tested the impact
TREX2 and RAD18 had on PCNA ubiquitination. As a control we found UV light, but not
γ-radiation, enhanced PCNA ubiquitination as previously seen in human cells21 (Extended
data Fig. 6a). TREX2 and RAD18 were needed for efficient PCNA ubiquitination after
exposure to UV light (Extended data Fig. 6b-d). In addition, cells deleted for both RAD18
and TREX2 (Extended data Fig. 7) showed no further reduction in PCNA ubiquitination
suggesting they are epistatic (Extended data Fig. 6b-d). These observations are consistent
with TREX2 being part of the EF-PRR machinery and implicate RAD18 and TREX2 in RF
maintenance.

Potential mechanisms for repeat fusion are faulty DNA repair and faulty DNA replication2.
Repeat fusion could manifest from faulty DNA repair since γ-radiation and UV light
increased fusion. However, the odds that damage actually occurred in or near the reporter
sequences is small (even after exposure to agent); thus, the agents could cause a
compensatory increase in repair pathways. RAD51/BRCA2/BLM are involved in both DSB
repair and RF maintenance6,7,10,11,15,29 so either are possible while direct evidence that
RAD18 and TREX2 maintain RFs is lacking in mammalian cells. Therefore, rad18-/- and
trex2null cells were exposed to a brief pulse of low concentration HU (0.5 mM 90 min.) that
depletes nucleotides to stall RFs without causing DSBs6,7,10,29. We found rad18-/- and
trex2null exhibited elevated levels of stalled RFs compared to control cells (Fig. 3a,
p<0.0001) similar to depletion of the RAD5 ortholog, HLTF30. We further tested faulty
replication as causal for repeat fusion by exposing cells with the IRR or MRR to this mild

HU concentration (Fig. 3b). This exposure increased repeat fusion for the IRR (p=0.00025,
student t-test) and MRR (p=0.0037). Our observations suggest a BLM-regulated pathway
consistent with HR fused identical repeats while a RAD18/TREX2-dependent pathway
consistent with EF-PRR fused mismatched repeats during replicative stress. These pathways
are good candidates for causing complex rearrangements found in cancer and genomic
disorders in people and chromosomal variation that leads to species diversification.

METHODS
Construction of the IRR and MRR

Author Manuscript

The IRR and MRR contain a puromycin phosphotransferase (puro) selection cassette and an
HPRT minigene31 (miniHPRT). Puro was positioned 5’ to miniHPRT and used to select for
stable transfectants. MiniHPRT contains a phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK) promoter32,
exons 1 and 2, intron and exons 3-8 with polyadenylation sequences. The 3’ half of
miniHPRT was inverted from intronic Xba1. Major satellite repeats (MSRs)33 were
positioned at inversion junctions in an indirect orientation. The same MSR sequence (below)
is located at both junctions for the IRR (Fig. 1a, green arrow) and at the 5’ junction for the
MRR (Fig. 1b, green arrow) while a divergent MSR (seven mismatches) is located at the 3’
end for the MRR (Fig. 1b, orange arrow). These mismatches are the only difference between
the reporters.

ESGRO (LIF)] on plastic plates precoated with gelatin (0.1%, ~1 hour) and seeded with 2.5
× 106 primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs, mutated for Hprt and resistant to
puromycin, exposed to 30 Gy γ-irradiation) and incubate at atmospheric O2, 5% CO2, 37°C.
ES cells were also cultured on gelatinized plates without feeders.
Repeat fusion assay

Author Manuscript

Repeat fusion is seen in cells transfected with the IRR or MRR (Figs. 1d, 2, 3b). Transfect
ES cells (5 × 106, 800 μl PBS) with 5 μg of uncut IRR or MRR by electroporation (Bio-Rad
Gene Pulsar at 230 V, 500 μF). Seed cells onto 3-6 3.5 cm plates with mitotically inactivated
MEFs. Each well is a replicate because they remain separate. Add puromycin (3 μg/ml) next
day. About 100-200 puromycin resistant colonies grow for each well. Seven days later, pool
puromycin resistant colonies for each well and passaged onto a 3.5 cm plate precoated with
gelatin. Three days later passage cells onto a 10 cm plate precoated with gelatin. See below
for agent expose cells. For unexposed cells, next day seed 1 × 106 cells onto a gelatin coated
10 cm plastic plate in M15 supplemented with 1 × HAT (1 mM sodium hypoxanthine, 4 μM
aminopterin, and 160 μM thymidine). Count HAT-resistant colonies 10 days later. To
control for seeding efficiencies, seed 2000 cells for each replicate onto a gelatin coated 3.5
cm plastic plate and culture in M15 without selection. Determine percentage of HAT
resistant colonies by dividing the number of HAT resistant colonies by the number of cells
electroporated multiplied by the seeding efficiency.

Author Manuscript

For cells exposed to agent [γ-radiation or UV light or hydroxyurea (HU)] the protocol is the
same for the transfection, selection in puromycin and expansion of puromycin resistant cells
(see above). After expansion, expose cells to either 4 Gy γ-radiation (137Cs at a rate of 0.125
Gy/sec., Mark1 gamma radiation source from Shepard and Associates) or 20 J/m2 UV light
(a duel wavelength UV transilluminator from Alpha Innotech Corp. at a rate of 1 J/m2 per
second) or HU (0.5 mM 90 min.). For γ-radiation and UV light, expose cells directly on the
plate after removing media. Then add 10 mls of pre-warmed (37°C) fresh media and
incubated for 48 hours. Then seed 1 × 106 cells onto a gelatin coated 10 cm plastic plate in
M15 supplemented with 1 × HAT. Count HAT-resistant colonies 10 days later. To control
for seeding efficiencies and survival fraction, seed 2000 cells for each replicate onto a
gelatin coated 3.5 cm plastic plate and culture in M15 without selection. Survival fraction is
~10%, 0.6% or 100% after exposure to γ-radiation (4 Gy), UV (20 J/m2) or HU (0.5 mM 90
min.), respectively.
