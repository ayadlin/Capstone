Abstract
Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and cyclin D1 are both key mediators of cell growth and proliferation in
normal and cancer cells. However, the interrelation between HIF and cyclin D1 remains unclear. In the present
study, we observed the inverse correlation between cyclin D1 and HIF-1 in hypoxia condition. Overexpression
of the dominant negative mutant of HIF-1α (DN-HIF) significantly enhanced cyclin D1 expression upon hypoxia or arsenite exposure, suggesting the negative regulation of cyclin D1 by HIF-1. Furthermore, we found
that the impairment of HIF-1 increased cyclin D1 expression in A549 pulmonary cancer cells, which in turn
promoted G1-S cell cycle transition and cell proliferation. Cyclin D1 expression was increased in s.c. xenograft of DN-HIF stably transfected A549 cells in nude mice compared with that of control cells. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay revealed that HIF-1 was able to directly bind to the promoter region of cyclin D1,
which indicates that the negative regulation of cyclin D1 by HIF-1 is through a direct mechanism. Inhibition
of histone deacetylase (HDAC) by pretreatment of cells with trichostatin A or specific knockdown of HDAC7
by its shRNA antagonized the suppression of cyclin D1 by HIF-1, suggesting that HDAC7 is required for
HIF-1–mediated cyclin D1 downregulation. Moreover, we found that 5-fluorouracil–triggered apoptosis of
DN-HIF–transfected A549 cells was reduced by sicyclin D1 (cyclin D1–specific interference RNA) introduction, suggesting that clinical observation of HIF-1 overexpression–associated chemoresistance might be, at
least partially, due to the negative regulation of cyclin D1. Cancer Res; 70(5); 2010–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Mammalian cells can respond differently to wide ranges of
oxygen through alterations in both their metabolic states and
growth rates (1, 2). Cells undergo a variety of biological
changes upon hypoxic conditions, including activation of signaling pathways that regulate proliferation, angiogenesis,
and death. The primary factor mediating this response is
hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1; ref. 3). HIF-1 was first discovered by the identification of a hypoxia response element
(HRE) in the 3′ enhancer of the gene for erythropoietin,
a hormone that stimulates erythrocyte proliferation (4, 5).

Because quite a few cells and organs need to adapt to the
decrease of oxygen supply, it would not be surprising to find
that a significant variety of HIF-1 target genes are regulated
on tissue or cell-specific manners. To date, there have been
>100 HIF-1 downstream genes characterized with various
functions (5, 6). Moreover, by using DNA microarrays, >2%
of the human genes have been identified to be regulated by
HIF-1 in arterial endothelial cells (7). Numerous studies on
moderate hypoxia have indicated that hypoxia-induced cell
cycle arrest is associated with a decreased activity of certain
cyclin–cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes, whereas
the exact machinery is not yet fully understood (8, 9).
Cyclin D1 serves as a key sensor and integrator of extracellular signals of cells in G0 and early G1 phases (10), mediating
its function through binding with Cdk4/6. Cdks phosphorylate the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, which further causes the dissociation and release of E2F transcription
factor (11–13). Liberated E2F subsequently promotes cell cycle progression and cell proliferation (14, 15). Aberrant
cyclin D1 expression is a critical event in cancer development, and it can be induced by many oncogenic signals,
including Ras (16), Src (17), ErbB2 (18), β-catenin (19), signal
transducers and activators of transcription (STAT; ref 20), etc.
Our previous studies have shown that arsenite is able to induce
cyclin D1 expression and promote cell proliferation in human
keratinocyte HaCat and mouse epidermal Cl41 cells (14, 21).

Negative Regulation of Cyclin D1 by HIF-1

Although genetic studies from mouse HIF-1α null cells
have strongly indicated that HIF-1α is required for hypoxiainduced cell cycle arrest, the mechanism underlying hypoxiainduced cell cycle arrest remains undetermined thus far
(22, 23). Sequence analysis of cyclin D1 promoter revealed
two putative binding sites (5′-RCGTG-3′) for HIF-1 (−559 to
−555 and −397 to −392; refs. 24, 25). Therefore, it is important
to investigate whether HIF-1 regulates cyclin D1 expression,
and if it does, what will be the molecular mechanism.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. Human bronchial epithelial
Beas-2B cells, human embryo kidney 293T cells, human lung
carcinoma A549 cells, and HIF-1–deficient mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (HIF-1−/−) and its wild-type (WT) control cells
were cultured in DMEM (Calbiochem) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). Hypoxic treatment was carried out in
a specially designed hypoxia incubator (Thermo Electron)
with 1% air, 5% CO2, and 94% N2. Arsenite (As3+) and NiCl2
were purchased from Aldrich.
Plasmids construction. HRE luciferase reporter was constructed by inserting the sequence of the HIF-1 binding site
into the luciferase reporter vector pGL2-basic (Promega; refs.
25–27). Cyclin D1 pGL3 basic reporter plasmid contains
the cyclin D1 promoter sequence from −962 to +135 relative
to the transcription initiation site. The cyclin D1 promoter–
driven eGFP reporter (cyclin D1-eGFP) was constructed by
inserting a 743-bp NcoI-XbaI fragment of eGFP into cyclin
D1 pGL3 basic reporter to replace the luciferase fragment.
The pCEP4/dominant negative mutant of HIF-1α (DN-HIF)
plasmid was constructed as described previously (28). The
ΔHRE (−559 to −392) cyclin D1 reporter, which contains a
cyclin D1 promoter sequence lacking the HIF-1 binding site,
was derived from cyclin D1-luciferase reporter by overlap
extension PCR using the following primers: A, 5′-ggggtaccgagctcttacgcgtg-3′; B, 5′-aaggccggcaggccagtaaattgcaagaa-3′;
C, 5′-tggcctgccggccttccta-3′; and D, 5′-cccaagcttctggggagggctgtg-3′. pEF-Bos/HIF-1α was generously provided by Sogawa
K, which was constructed by inserting full-length human
HIF-1α cDNA into the blunt-ended XbaI site of empty vector
pEF-BOS (29). pSuppressor/sicyclin D1 plasmid was constructed as described previously (14). pSUPER expression
plasmid carrying shRNA against histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7)
was constructed according to the pSUPER RNAi system.
Transient transfection. 293T cells or A549 cells were cultured in a six-well plate until they reached 40% to 50% confluence. Transfection was performed in each well in the
absence of serum with Lipofectamine 2000 according to
the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).
Stable transfection. Beas-2B and A549 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg hygromycine B–resistant plasmid or
geneticin-resistant plasmid together with 4.5 μg HREluciferase reporter, cyclin D1-luciferase reporter, or DNHIF plasmid in combination with 10 μl Lipofectamine
2000 according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
The stable transfectants (pooled stably tranfected cells),
including Beas-2B HRE-luc mass1, Beas-2B cyclinD1-Luc

mass1, Beas-2B pCEP4/DN-HIF mass2 (the second pool of
stable transfectant), Beas-2B pCEP4 control cells, A549
pCEP4/DN-HIF mass1, and A549 pCEP4 control cells, were
established by hygromycin B or G418 selection.
Luciferase assay. Viable cells (8 × 103) were seeded into
each well of 96-well plates. After cell density reached 80%
to 90%, cells were exposed to arsenite or hypoxia for various
time periods. The cells were lysed with 50 μL lysis buffer, and
luciferase activity was measured using Promega luciferase assay reagent with Synergy 2 Multidetection Microplate Reader
(BioTek Instruments, Inc.). The results are expressed as the
activation of HRE and the induction of cyclin D1 relative to
medium control. Each bar indicates the mean and SD of the
triplicate wells. The asterisk indicates a significant difference
from medium control cells (P < 0.05).
Cell proliferation analysis. A549 cells (1 × 103) and their
stable transfectants were cultured in each well of 96-well
plates in 10% FBS DMEM. ATP activity was measured using
Cell Counting Kit-8 with a Synergy 2 microplate reader at
various time points according to the guidance of the manufacturer. The results were expressed as proliferation index
relative to control cells.
Flow cytometry assay. A549 cells (2 × 105) were cultured
in each well of six-well plates at 70% to 80% confluence. Following serum starvation for 24 h, the cells were cultured in
complete culture medium for 12 h and then harvested and
fixed in 75% ethanol at 4°C overnight. The cells were incubated with RNase A (100 μg/mL) for 10 min at room temperature, and DNA was stained with 50 μg/mL propidium iodide
for at least 15 min at 37°C. The DNA content was determined by flow cytometry using the EPICS XL flow cytometer
(Beckman Coulter).
Reverse transcription–PCR. Total RNA was extracted
from the cells using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription–
PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using specific human VEGF
primers (sense, 5′-ccttgctgctctacctccac-3′; antisense, 5′-atctgcatggtgatgttgga-3′), human cyclin D1 primers (sense, 5′-agctcctgtgctgcgaagtggaaac-3′; antisense, 5′-agtgttcaatgaaatcgtgcg
gggt-3′), β-actin primers (sense, 5′-gcgagaagatgacccagatcat3′; antisense, 5′-gctcaggaggagcaatgatctt-3′), human HDAC1
primers (sense, 5′-agacccagaggagaagaaag-3′; antisense, 5′ttccaaagctactaagcagg-3′), human HDAC2 primers (sense, 5′caatctaactgtcaaaggtcatgc-3′; antisense, 5′-tgaagtctggtccaaaatactcaa-3′), human HDAC6 primers (sense, 5′-tgatccaaactcctctagcct-3′; antisense, 5′-agagcctggtggtggacatag-3′),
and human HDAC7 primers (sense, 5′-tggtgtctgctggatttgatg3′; antisense, 5′-atccaaaacatttggcagaaacat-3′). Quantity one
analysis software (Bio-Rad) was used to quantify the PCR
products.
Real-time RT-PCR. The original amount of the specific
transcripts of cyclin D1 was determined using a SYBR Green
real-time RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems). Primers for these
transcripts were the same with those used in RT-PCR, and
β-actin was amplified as inner control.
Western blot. The Beas-2B or A549 cell extract was separated on polyacrylamide-SDS gels, transferred, and probed
with a specific primary antibody. The protein band, specifically

bound to the primary antibody, was detected using an IRDye
800CW-conjugated secondary antibody and LI-COR imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences). The primary antibodies
HIF-1α (Y-15), HIF-1β, cyclin D2, and HDAC7 were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.
Immunohistochemistry. A549 cells (2 × 106) stably transfected with either DN-HIF or vector control were injected s.c.
into the flanks of 6-wk-old nude mice. Four weeks after cell
inoculation, the mice were sacrificed and the xenograft
tumors were excised and subjected to immunohistochemical
staining. These procedures were approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee of Shanghai, China. The sections
were incubated with anti–cyclin D1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) or anti–HIF-1α antibody (Novus Biologicals, Inc.) at 4°C overnight and then with horseradish
peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody at 37°C for
30 min. The sections were finally incubated with diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin for detection.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The cells were
cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and lysed as described
previously (30). The chromatin DNA was sonicated to an
average size of 300 to 500 bp. The immunoprecipitations
were carried out in a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
dilution buffer [0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 2 mmol/L
EDTA, 167 mmol/L NaCl, 16.7 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.1),
1 μg/mL aprotinin, and 1 μg/mL pepstatin A] with anti–
HIF-1α antibody. A normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) was used
as control. PCR primers (sense, 5′-catgctaaattagttcttgca-3′;

antisense, 5′-ctggggagaccacgagaa-3′) for cyclin D1 proximal
promoter (National Center for Biotechnology Information,
Genbank X59798) were used to amplify the precipitated DNA.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling assay. For DNA nick end labeling, A549
cells were plated on poly-L-lycine–coated cover slides and
exposed to 100 μmol/L 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for 36 h. Slides
were immersed in 4% methanol-free formaldehyde diluted in
PBS and then processed for the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay
according to the manufacturer's instruction of TdT-FragEL
DNA fragmentation detection kit (CalBiochem).
Statistical analysis. The significance of the difference
between the treated and untreated groups was determined
using the Student's t test, and the statistical significance
was set at P < 0.01 or P < 0.05.

Results
Inverse correlation between cyclin D1 and HIF-1 in
hypoxia. To elucidate the interrelation between cyclin D1
and HIF-1, Beas-2B cyclin D1-Luc mass1 cells were exposed
to hypoxia stimulation. Luciferase assay showed that the
expression of cyclin D1 was notably reduced in hypoxia condition (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, Western blot assay
revealed the inverse correlation between cyclin D1 and
HIF-1 at protein level in pulmonary cells. Furthermore,

Negative Regulation of Cyclin D1 by HIF-1

impairment of HIF-1 by DN-HIF overexpression significantly
blocked cyclin D1 reduction in hypoxia response (Fig. 1C).
HIF-1 negatively regulates cyclin D1 expression. As shown
in Supplementary Fig. S1A and B, exposure of Beas-2B cells
to arsenite resulted in notable HRE activation and HIF-1α
accumulation. Meanwhile, arsenite-triggered cyclin D1 induction in Beas-2B cells was verified by gene reporter assay
and RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D). To test
whether HIF-1 was able to regulate cyclin D1 expression,
Beas-2B pCEP4/DN-HIF mass2 was established (Supplementray Fig. S1E and F). We found that cyclin D1 expression
in DN-HIF stable transfectant was significantly increased,
at both RNA and protein level, in Beas-2B cells exposed
to arsenite (Fig. 2A and B), which indicates the negative
regulation of cyclin D1 by HIF-1. HIF-1α knockout mouse
embryonic fibroblast cells were used in current study, and
the result showed that cyclin D1 induction by arsenite in
HIF-1α knockout cells was notably enhanced compared

with that in WT cells (Supplementary Fig. S1G). To investigate whether the negative regulation of cyclin D1 by HIF-1
was a general cellular event in normal condition, cyclin
D1-eGFP reporter plasmid was constructed and transiently
transfected into 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, fluorescence intensity of eGFP was significantly higher in the cells
cotransfected with DN-HIF expression plasmid than that in
control cells. Introduction of DN-HIF by transient transfection also led to the dose-dependent increase of cyclin D1
promoter activation in 293T cells (Fig. 2D).
Suppression of HIF-1 facilitates G1-S transition and
proliferation of tumor cells. Hypoxia is a common feature
of many cancers, contributing to tumor progression as well
as potentially compromising radiotherapy and chemotherapy
(31). To address the role of HIF-1 in the regulation of cyclin
D1 expression and the subsequent oncogenic contribution in
tumor cells, A549 pCEP4/DN-HIF mass1 stable transfectant
was established. As shown in Fig. 3A, VEGF expression was

decreased in A549 pCEP4/DN-HIF mass1 cells with or without arsenite stimulation, whereas cyclin D1 expression was
notably increased. Considering the key role of cyclin D1 in
G1-S phase cell cycle transition and cell proliferation, we
examined whether the inhibition of HIF-1 could promote cell
cycle progression and facilitate cancer cell growth. As shown
in Fig. 3B, inhibition of HIF-1 by DN-HIF overexpression led
to the increase of S-phase cells from 26.7% to 32.6% (5.9%
difference), which was resulted from the decrease of A549
cells in G1 phase. Consequently, increased cell growth was
observed in A549 DN-HIF mass1 cells in comparison with
the control cells (Fig. 3C; Supplementary Fig. S2). As shown
in Fig. 3D, s.c. xenograft of DN-HIF stably transfected A549

cells exhibited notably increased cyclin D1 expression
compared with that of control cells, revealing the negative
regulation of HIF-1 on cyclin D1 in vivo.
HIF-1 directly interacts with cyclin D1 promoter. To test
whether the negative regulation of cyclin D1 by HIF-1 was
through direct mechanism, HRE sequences in cyclin D1
promoter region were deleted by overlap extension PCR
(Fig. 4A). A significant increase of cyclin D1 promoter activation by arsenite was observed in ΔHRE cyclin D1 reporter
plasmid transiently transfected A549 cells compared with
WT cyclin D1 reporter plasmid–transfected cells (Fig. 4B),
which indicates that HIF-1 could downregulate cyclin D1
transcription via the interaction with cyclin D1 promoter.

Negative Regulation of Cyclin D1 by HIF-1

To obtain direct evidence of the association of HIF-1 with
cyclin D1 promoter, nuclear extracts from Beas-2B cells,
293T cells, or A549 cells with accumulated HIF-1 by nickel
treatment were subjected to ChIP assay. The fragment of
cyclin D1 promoter was coprecipitated by anti–HIF-1α antibody specifically, which further verified the association of
HIF-1 with the cyclin D1 promoter (Fig. 4C).
HDAC7 is required in HIF-mediated cyclin D1 downregulation. It has been well documented that many transcriptional repressors exert their inhibitory effect via
association with HDACs (32, 33). We therefore tested whether
the repression of cyclin D1 transcription by HIF-1 requires
HDACs activity. As shown in Fig. 5A and B, real-time PCR assay elucidated the expression of cyclin D1 was significantly
suppressed by forced HIF-1α expression, whereas the inhibitory effect was dramatically compromised at presence of the
HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). It has been reported
that HDAC7 was able to interact with HIF-1α and mediate
the expression of HIF downstream target genes (34). To test
whether HDAC7 was involved in the downregulation of cyclin
D1 by HIF-1, shHDAC7 expression plasmid was constructed
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). As shown in Fig. 5C and D,
HIF-1α overexpression notably suppressed cyclin D1 expression, whereas inhibition of HDAC7 by its specific interference
RNA significantly impaired the suppression of cyclin D1 by
HIF-1. Taken together, these results suggest that the negative
regulation of cyclin D1 by HIF-1 is through a direct mechanism and may require HDAC7 activity.
Suppression of cyclin D1 by HIF-1 led to chemoresistance.
Accumulating studies have elucidated that hypoxia is closely
associated with the cancer prognosis and chemotherapeutic
effect of anticancer drugs, especially to those cell cycle–specific agents (CCSA; ref. 31). In present study, A549 cells was
exposed to 5-FU, a potent CCSA, which is principally effective

to cancer cells in S phase. As shown in Fig. 6A and B, 5FU–triggered apoptosis of A549 cells was slightly enhanced
by forced expression of DN-HIF and was significantly reduced by pSuper/sicyclin D1 transfection (identification of
pSuper/sicyclin D1 was shown in Supplementary Fig. S4).
Meanwhile, apoptosis of A549 cells exposed to etoposide,
which is a cell cycle–nonspecific agent to various cancer
cells, was only marginally influenced by DN-HIF expression,
and pSuper/sicyclin D1 transfection did not show any effect
(Fig. 6C). Collectively, our data indicated that suppression of
cyclin D1 by HIF-1 led to the decrease of the cells in S phase
and may result in, at least in part, the resistance of cancer
cells against those antimetabolic CCSAs.

Discussion
It has been well documented that HIF-1 plays an essential
role in cellular response to hypoxia by inducing glycolysis
and angiogenesis (35, 36). Previous studies also reported that
HIF-1 was involved in cell growth arrest (22). However, the
detailed mechanism underlying HIF-induced cell cycle arrest
and the related pro-oncogenic effect remains unclear. In
current study, we showed the negative regulation of cyclin
D1 by HIF-1 in human Beas-2B cells, 293T cells, A549 cancer
cells, and even in malignant tissue. Further study revealed
that inhibition of HIF-1α facilitated cyclin D1 expression
and G1-S cell cycle transition of A549 cells, which subsequently promoted cell proliferation. Results of deleted mutation analysis of HRE sequence in cyclin D1 promoter, ChIP
assay, and epigenetic study verified the interaction of HIF-1
with cyclin D1 promoter. These data, for the first time, showed
that HIF-1 can regulate cyclin D1 expression via direct
mechanism. In addition, our results further revealed that

the negative regulation of cyclin D1 by HIF-1 is closely associated with chemoresistance of lung cancer cells.
It has been well established that overproliferation causes
tumors to outgrow their blood supply (37). Despite the fact
that overgrowth of blood vessels is a distinguished feature of
cancer, the interior of tumor still becomes progressively hypoxic because new blood vessels are aberrant and have poor
blood flow. The ability to survive under hypoxic conditions is
one of the fundamental differences between tumor cells and
normal cells, although the qualitative and quantitative differences in hypoxia response of both cell types are not
known yet. In both tumor and normal cells, hypoxia activates a complex transcriptome that includes various hypoxia response molecules (38).
Transcription factor HIF-1 is a major regulator of cells
upon hypoxic response (3). It is accumulated in the nucleus
of cells short of oxygen supply and exerts its transcriptional
activity via binding to HRE sequence of the target genes, including VEGF, erythropoietin, and phosphoglycerate kinase.
HIF consists of an O2-regulated HIF-α subunit (HIF-1α,

2016

HIF-2α, or HIF-3α) and the constitutively expressed HIF-1β
subunit (6). Overexpression of HIF-1α and HIF-2α was found
in various human cancers, probably as a consequence of
intratumoral hypoxia. Some of the evidence to date has
suggested that, whereas HIF-1 has broad spectrum of activity, the response to HIF-2 and HIF-3 is restricted to specific
cell types (39). The most extensively studied isoform of HIF
is the ubiquitous HIF-1. In current study, arsenite, which can
induce the accumulation of HIF-1α protein, was used to
study the correlation between HIF-1 and cyclin D1. Although we have observed arsenite can induce cyclin D1
expression via phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt–dependent
pathway in Beas-2B cells, the results here clearly showed
the negative regulation of cyclin D1 by HIF-1 in Beas-2B
cells upon arsenite treatment (40).
It has been reported that HIF-1α knockout embryos die at
an early stage and that mice lacking HIF-1α die in utero (38),
indicating the essential role of HIF-1 in nonhypoxia environment. In current study, we show that HIF-1 inhibits cyclin D1
expression in normoxia condition in both 293T cells and

Negative Regulation of Cyclin D1 by HIF-1

Figure 6. Suppression of cyclin D1 by HIF-1α led to chemoresistance. A, A549 cells transiently transfected with the plasmids as indicated were exposed
to 5-FU for 36 h and then subjected to TUNEL assay. Apoptotic cells with markedly deep stained and pyknotic nucleus were distinguished from
nonapoptotic cells. B and C, quantitation of apoptotic cells was achieved by flow cytometry assay.

A549 cells. Impairment of HIF-1α by its dominant negative
mutant markedly increased the mRNA and protein levels
of cyclin D1 in 293T and A549 cells, which subsequently
led to enhanced G1-S cell cycle transition and cell proliferation. Although the basal level of HIF-1α protein is low in
normal cells and the function of HIF-1α is predominantly
investigated in hypoxia response, these results provide new
insight in the biological function of HIF-1 in normoxic
condition.
It is widely accepted that alterations of gene expression
that drive uncontrolled cell cycle progression are requisite
events during tumorigenesis (14, 21, 41). Cyclin D1, acting
as a sensor in response to extracellular changes, plays a
pivotal role in cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase,
which has been reported to be essential during cell proliferation. Expression of cyclin D1 is mediated by multiple transcription factors, such as NF-κB (42), activator
protein-1 (17, 43), sp-1/sp-3 (44), E2F/DP (18), STAT (20),
cAMP-responsive element binding protein (18, 44, 45), etc.
Given that there are two HRE sequences in cyclin D1 proximal promoter, there is no report concerning the direct regulation of cyclin D1 by HIF-1 thus far. In present study, we
elucidated that the negative regulation of HIF-1α on cyclin
D1 is through its direct interaction with HRE sequence in
cyclin D1 proximal promoter and requires HDAC7 involvement. This will subsequently lead to the inhibition of G1-S
cell cycle transition and proliferation of tumor cells.

Extensive effort has been put into exploring how cancer
cells promote their own survival, and accumulating evidence
has proved that HIF-1 plays a critical role in tumor development by regulating angiogenesis, glycolysis, and erythropoiesis (6). In present study, we found that HIF-1 is able to
downregulate cyclin D1 expression and then restrict cancer
cell growth. We assume that this inhibitory effect will assist
cancer cells to survive in hypoxia and insufficient nutrition,
because overgrowth in such unfavorable condition is deleterious to the cancer cells themselves. A slowdown of cancer cell
growth in hypoxic condition is obviously in favor of cell survival, especially when new blood vessels are aberrant and not
yet able to provide sufficient blood supply. Whereas angiogenesis relieves hypoxic stress, accumulated HIF-1α protein
will be degraded and fast growth of tumor cells will be recovered. Therefore, HIF-1 functions as a critical regulator
of tumor in hypoxia condition, which facilitates cancer cell
survival as well as tumor growth.
Numerous studies have elucidated that the interior of the
tumor mass becomes progressively hypoxic, especially in
those aggressive tumors, and hypoxia is reported to be associated with poor prognosis and resistance to radiation therapy (37, 46, 47). Elevated expression of HIF-1 is usually
detected in various solid tumors, including colon, breast,
prostate, and lung cancers, and is associated with resistance
to therapies and poor prognosis in head and neck cancer,
ovarian cancer, and esophageal cancer (48, 49). Because

Wen et al.

we have found that HIF-1 could arrest cancer cell growth
through the inhibition of G1-S cell cycle transition, it is conceivable that cancer cells may adopt a similar scheme to
survive chemotherapeutic attacks too. Based on the result
of the present study, we conclude that HIF-1–induced G0-G1
phase arrest may account for the resistance of cancer cells
to some chemotherapeutic agents that target DNA synthesis
in S phase. The maximal therapeutic effects are likely to be
achieved by treating patients with several types of anticancer drugs, just as we use “cocktail therapy” for infections
and hypertension. Because HIF-1 is likely to be one of the
most valuable therapeutic targets, antitumor therapy targeting HIF-1 in cancer is highly worthy to be anticipated.
