Abstract:

More effective anticancer agents are essential, as has too often been
demonstrated by the paucity of therapeutics which preserve life. Their discovery
is very difficult. Many approaches are being applied, from testing folk medicines
to automated high throughput screening of large chemical libraries. Mutations
in cancer cells create dysfunctional regulatory systems. This Perspective
summarizes an approach to applying defective molecular control mechanisms
as oncotargets on which drug discoveries against cancer can be based.

INTRODUCTION

the abnormal molecular regulatory mechanisms that are
necessary for progression of cancer.

The molecular basis of cancer is becoming
understood, and is thoroughly reviewed [1]. But the
promise of cancer drug therapy is unfulfilled. ‘Magic
bullets’ against the disease have not been discovered.
Chemotherapy often only briefly extends life and has
severe side effects. As examples, the combination of
paclitaxel and anthracycline is often used against breast
cancer, although it benefits only 30% of patients. Drugs
are not effective against stage IV melanoma; about half
the patients develop metastases [2].
Improvements of cancer treatment are sorely needed.
A major problem is selective lethality against cancer cells.
Many drugs kill cancer cells in culture and in mice, but
also kill normal cells and have severe side effects. This
limits drug dosage. Another problem is that cancers
respond differently to chemotherapy, as do five principal
subtypes of breast cancer [3]. Discovery and clinical
testing of an effective anticancer drug is enormously
difficult and expensive; developing a potential drug can
cost over 800 millions of dollars. Millions of chemicals,
randomly synthesized even without a lead compound,
are being screened and tested with rapid endpoints such
as their lethality to cultured cancer cells. It is timely to
summarize attempts to develop cancer therapies from

I. Normal cell regulatory
biology and oncotargets
Approaches to discovering oncotargets can be based
upon biochemical pathways of small molecule, protein
and nucleic acids synthesis and degradation. These are
qualitatively similar between normal and cancer cells, but
their regulatory processes, either lost or constitutive in
cancers [4] are more likely to provide oncotargets.
Major molecular biological regulatory mechanisms
were discovered fifty-plus years ago. These include
covalent enzyme modifications catalyzed by kinases,
non-covalent binding by small molecules that rapidly
feedback inhibit their own synthesis, e.g., metabolic
feedback inhibition, protein-protein interactions alone
or in multiprotein complexes, control of gene activation
by repression, and functional activities of membranes.
Another level of regulation is transport of small molecules
including metabolites, drugs and regulators through
the lipid bilayer cell membrane. Lipophilic molecules
diffuse into the cytoplasm, but charged metabolites such
as amino acids and nucleotides can require specific and
544

energy-requiring enzyme-like permease channels. As an
example, a ring of core proteins with attached regulatory
calcium ion binding proteins is a ‘gate’ for potassium ions
[5]. These changed regulatory mechanisms can provide
targets for discovery of new treatments.

Cancers become resistant to treatment; the tumor can
shrink but the patient will die because lethal stem cells
survive. These are proposed to be crucial targets for
therapy [19]. A strategy that includes finding oncotargets
present in cancer stem cells may help alleviate this
resistance to therapy. BB1608, a first-in-class cancer stem
cell stemness inhibitor is in clinical trials with promising
phase I data (Langebland, AACR, 2010). Development of
methods for producing immortalized mammary stem cells
that can self replicate and differentiate should greatly help
discovery of stem cell oncotargets [20].

II. Molecules essential for
cancer cell growth and/or
survival.
Mutations

Metastasis and oncotargets

Cancer cells deviate from normal cells due to
mutations. An advanced tumor is composed of cells that
have undergone diverse and numerous mutations, creating
cells with many different properties. Thousands of
changed gene expression have been found, but most do not
appear in most cancers and are not essential. They might
be caused by secondary mutations. Mutations increase as
cancer develops, at least in part because the DNA repair
mechanisms are defective, creating genetic instability
[6]. Telomere loss is also a mechanism for chromosome
instability [7]. DNA structure is thereby changed and
alters amounts and characteristics of enzymes and other
proteins. These mutations can stimulate oncogenes or
inactivate tumor suppressor genes. In extreme cases
mutation completely eliminates production of a protein.
Therapies are being designed that target repair mechanisms
[8]). Targeting a cancer driven by an activating mutation
of B-raf is showing promise. A highly potent and specific
B-raf inhibitor induced regression of melanoma in 80% of
patients bearing activating B-raf mutations [9].
Epigenetics, heritable changes other than of the
genomic sequence, have recently become of major
interest. Gene expressions can be modified by postsynthetic methylations of DNA or of methylation and
acetylation of associated histones in chromatin of
eukaryotes [10]. They are heterogeneous in patients [11].
Epigenetic modifications are involved in plasticity, the
capacity of alteration of a cell’s phenotype in response
to changes in environment [12]. They can modify gene
expressions for many cycles, as during differentiation of
stem cells [13], and could become permanent, and thereby
involved during cancer progression, in loss of cells ability
to differentiate and become quiescent [14].
Epigenetic oncotargets are abundant [15] and are
being applied for drug development [16]. Advancements
that include targeting histone methylation [17], and
mitochondria inner membrane transporters [18] may
provide novel therapeutic strategies that compliment/
synergize with the current available modalities.
Furthermore, cancer stem cells, a very small
subpopulation of cells with different properties from the
majority, appear to be fundamental to tumor progression.

Processes that can provide oncotargets are
molecular changes that cause defective proliferation,
block programmed cell death (apoptosis) under stress,
production of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), and drug
resistance, and escape of cells to initiate secondary tumors
(metastasis).
Metastasis appears in cancer progression, and is
a key step leading to malignancy and cancer lethality
[21. Epithelial cells undergo transition (EMT) to a
mesenchymal phenotype with loss of cell-cell adhesion,
more motility and greater invasiveness. EMT involves
several molecules that could provide oncotargets, such
as the metalloproteases that decrease cell adhesion. As an
example, kinase Akt1 was found to be hyperphosphorylated
when breast cancer cells became metastatic [22]. This
study illustrates the increased difficulty of treatment as a
cancer develops: Akt is also a key regulator of cell growth,
apoptosis and migration. It has roles in neurological and
other diseases. There are three isoforms of Akt with some
overlapping functions, although each isoform of Akt has
unique downstream targets. Growth factors binding to
receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., IGFR, erbB2) recruit Akt
to translocate to the cytoplasmic membrane where Thr308
on its activation loop and Ser473 on the hydrophobic motif
are phosphorylated by PDK1 and mTORC2, respectively,
leading to Akt activation.
Activation is reversed by phosphatases. PP2A
dephosphorylates Thr308 of Akt. In a search for a
phosphatase containing a PH domain that could colocalize with Akt near plasma membrane, PHLPP (PH
domain leucine rich repeat protein phosphatase) was
discovered to be the long sought after phosphatase for
Ser473 of Akt [23]. PHLPP containing a PP2C domain
is a member of the serine/threonine phosphatase family
Expression of PHLPP protein and mRNA are much
decreased in the metastatic cell line of the breast cancer
progression series 21T [22]. There are two isoforms;
PHLPP1b (SCOP) with an N-terminus extension is 1.5kb
longer than PHLPP1a. Another PHLPP family member,
PHLPPL that dephosphorylates Ser473 Akt was later
identified [24].
The requirement of domains for PHLPP functioning

545

is substrate dependent, as PH domain is essential for PKC
and PDZ domain is required for Akt dephosphorylation.
There are several highly conserved domains in PHLPP
and PHLPPL, including PH domain, leucine rich
repeat, PP2C domain and PDZ binding motif. PHLPP
and PHLPPL specifically dephosphorylate distinct Akt
isoforms. PHLPP exhibits high preference for Akt 2,
3, while PHLPPL has Akt 1, 3 as substrates. FKBP51
(FK506-binding protein 51) acts as a scaffolding protein
for Akt and PHLPP and promotes dephosphorylation of
Akt by PHLPP [25]. Besides Akt, PKC family members
(PKCa, PKCbII) were also identified as substrates for
PHLPPs [26].
PHLPP is a proteolytic target of b-TrCP (the substrate
recognition subunit of SCF-Ub E3 ligase complex).
Phosphorylation of four sites on the PP2C domain of
PHLPP by casein kinase I and GSK3b will promote
binding of PHLPP to b-TrCP that leads to ubiquitination
and degradation of PHLPP [27].
There are over 400 known Ser/Thr kinases and far
fewer (~30) Ser/Thr phosphatases. PHLPPs are predicted
to have more substrates other than Akt and PKCa. Mst1
(Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1) was identified as
a substrate for PHLPPs [28]. Mst1 participates in the
regulation of mammalian cell morphology, motility and
apoptosis by activation of mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK). Mst1 exists in auto-inhibitory dimers
maintained by phosphorylation at Thr387. The PP2C
domain of PHLPP interacts with Mst1 to dephosphorylate
Thr387 in the inhibitory domain of Mst1 that leads to
auto-phosphorylation on Thr183. FOXO, JNK and p38
pathways then become activated to promote apoptosis.
Interestingly, Akt and Mst1 are reciprocally inhibitory.
The Thr387 site of Mst1 can be phosphorylated by Akt
and become inactivated. Mst1 could inhibit Ser473 Akt
phosphorylation. Therefore, PHLPP, Akt and Mst1 form
an intricate triangle to orchestrate the fine balance of cell
survival and apoptosis in normal cells.
PHLPP, a tumor suppressor, is present in the majority
of human tissues. Its expression is much decreased
in human colon, pancreatic and gastric cancer patient
specimens [28][29]. Over-expression of PHLPP reduces
the tumorigenesis of glioblastoma and colon cancer cells
in a xenograft nude mice model. In PHLPP1-null mice
impaired capacity to stabilize circadian periodicity after
light-induced resetting is observed [30].
In another PHLPP knockout mouse model Akt
phosphorylation elicited by ischemia/ reperfusion injury
is enhanced; thereby Akt exerts its cardio-protective
effect to reduce infarct size [31]. PHLPP (SCOP) was
originally identified as an oscillating protein in the SCN
nucleus that plays important roles in circadian rhythms.
In addition, it regulates ERK signaling by interacting with
Ras to modulate long-term memory [32]. How PHLPPs
become activated is still under intensive investigation.
As our understanding evolves, more PHLPP oncotargets
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

will be identified and more function of PHLPPs will be
discovered. The PHLPP-Akt-Mst1 pathway, deregulated
in tumors, may result in more specific cancer therapeutics
that minimize off target effects.

Cell proliferation.
Analysis of steps in the cell cycle, has been
extensively investigated to identify oncotargets that
lead to defective proliferation [33]. Extracellular factors
greatly modify initiation of proliferation. Normal cells
are arrested in G1 phase, prior to DNA synthesis, by
contacts with adjacent cells and the extracellular protein
matrix, but tumor cells continue to cycle. Epithelial cell
adhesion molecule EpCAM is over expressed in cancer
initiating cells. It is regulated negatively by the tumor
necrosis factor alpha [34]. Lipophilic hormones (estrogen
and androgen) permeate through cell membranes, bind
to nuclear receptors, and activate gene expressions [35].
This process provides oncotargets for synthetic analogs
that are applied against estrogen and androgen -receptor
over-expressing tumors.
Extracellular binding of a growth factor protein to
its trans-membrane receptor initiates cytoplasmic kinase
cascades, such as MAP kinases that activate transcription
factors in the nucleus. Epidermal growth factor (EGF)
binds to the Her2/neu receptor on membrane of quiescent
cells, which leads to the intracellular protein kinases
activation. Her2/neu is in excess in about one third of
breast cancers, and provides an oncotarget for drugs and
for antibodies such as herceptin. The anticancer drug
imatinib (Gleevec) that inhibits over active Bcr-Abl
kinase in certain cancers provides an example of a widely
applied therapy. Many kinases, including PI3K/Akt, have
now become targets for therapy [36].
The by induction-repression mechanism of
gene expression in the nucleus is vital for normal cell
proliferation and function. The first step is transcriptional
production of RNA, which is spliced into messenger RNA.
Synthesis is countered by hydrolysis. mRNA provides
information in their nucleotide sequence for translation
catalyzed by ribosomes into the amino acid sequence of a
protein, according to the genetic code.
siRNAs and microRNAs (miRNA) also regulate
cell proliferation. These short double-stranded RNAs bind
to mRNAs with complementary base sequence and target
them for destruction or inhibit their synthesis. siRNA
and miRNA have been widely used in cancer research
to pinpoint the functions of many genes. This new area
includes effects on epigenetics [37]. miRNAs play
important roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. siRNA
based cancer therapeutics are being actively pursued
[38][39]. A micro RNA, MiR-21 has been reported to
be essential for proliferation of many cancers. MiR-21
is ‘addictive’; tumors regress unless it is produced [40].
Synthetic asymmetric RNAs show the promise to improve
546

many proteins after they have been specifically tagged
by attachment of ubiquitin proteins [50]. The proteasome
inhibitor Velade (bortezomib) is applied clinically
against multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma; its
combinations with other drugs are being tested against
several types of malignancies. A protease blocks activation
of NF-kB. Its inhibitors thereby are pro-apoptotic for
cancer cells, and are being investigated.

the current siRNA approach [41]. A possible complication
is that Dicer and Drosha, key proteins involved in siRNA
processing, were found to be down-regulated in cancers
with poor outcome ([42]. These enzymes might become
oncotargets of future therapeutics [43].

DNA synthesis and mitosis as oncotargets.
Numerous drugs that block DNA replication or
cause damage are applied clinically [1]. The frequent
uncontrolled DNA synthesis in cancer cells presents an
oncotarget. Cyclin D and E are proteins synthesized in G1
phase of the cell cycle. They bind to and activate two cyclin
dependent kinases, which phosphorylate retinoblastoma
protein [44], thereby releasing DNA polymerase activity
and entry into S phase. Cleaved low molecular weight
cyclin E is found in many cancers, and is associated with
poor prognosis [45].
Mitosis is a cycle related oncotarget. An early
approach to drug discovery was to give a natural product
such as one used in herbal medicine to a tumor-bearing
animal and determine whether it is beneficial. One wellknown example is Taxol (paclitaxel), whose oncotarget
is microtubules in mitosis. Several chemically modified
Taxol derivatives were synthesized, tested for effect on
mitosis, and Taxol and Taxotere are presently applied as
anticancer drugs.
b-Lapachone , in a folk medicine isolated from a
tree’s bark, selectively kills cancer cells in culture and
in animals (46). It kills non-small lung cancer cells with
elevated mitochondrial enzyme NQO1 by futile cycling
of electron transport, which decreases production of
ATP and NAD and produces toxic reactive oxygen [47].
b-Lapachone acts by at least two mechanisms because
a four -fold higher dose also kills NQO1-negative cells
[46]. Production of cellular energy (ATP) in normal cells
is mainly by oxidation in mitochondria, versus increased
glycolysis in cytoplasm of cancer cells. This is a classical
example of a different biochemical process that provides
an oncotarget [48]. Several drugs that act on mitochondrial
functions are being developed [49].

Cancer cell removal
Programmed cell death (apoptosis) counteracts
uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells. It can be lost
in cancers, which provides an oncotarget: transcription
factor NF-kB , linked to inflammation through TNFa,
suppresses apoptosis of stressed cancer cells. The drug
Go6976 blocks NF-kB activation, inhibits growth and
causes degeneration of estrogen receptor negative breast
cancers in vivo without detected damage to vital organs
[51]. In vivo and in vitro experiments suggest that Go6796
blocks activation and anti-apoptotic activity of factor
NF-kB by inhibiting protease caspase-8 [52]. Apoptosis
of tumor cells was also sensitized by a polypeptide that
specifically neutralizes anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1, and
sensitizes cancer cells to drugs [53]. Drugs that promote
respiration can selectively cause apoptosis of cancer
cells [54]. Cells under stress release apoptotic protein
cytochrome C from their mitochondria. siRNAs control
apoptosis, among many processes [55]. Natural [56]
and modified [57] siRNAs are being tested for specific
anticancer activities

Angiogenesis, another source of oncotargets
Blood vessel formation within a large cancer is
required to provide oxygen and metabolites required to
permit proliferation of internal cells. These vessels also
allow released cancer cells to travel to distal sites and seed
new cancers (metastasis), a process that correlates with
lethality. Anti-angiogenesis agents such as Avastin can
block tumor growth [58]. Pleiotrophin is a cytokine that
induces tumor angiogenesis by binding to and inhibiting
its transmembrane receptor tyrosine phosphatase. It
also induces the association of b-catenin with cadherins
EMT, and many other properties associated with tumor
promotion [59].

Protein synthesis and removal
Synthesis of enzymes and other proteins are central
to regulation of biochemical processes. Enzymes that
degrade proteins are closely regulated in normal cells.
Excessive cancer cell proliferation depends upon short
lived proteins. in particular cyclins , whose degradation
can be defective. Protein synthesis is counterbalanced
by degradation. Small proteases are not yet successful
oncotargets; they can degrade both activating and
inhibiting regulatory proteins, and drugs that inhibit them
have complex effects. The proteasome, a large (about
50 subunit proteins) complex, mediates degradation of

III. Future oncotarget related
basic research and therapeutics.
Cancers progress from bad to worse. Biomarkers for
early detection thus are highly important [60]. Biomarkers
are also being sought for improved diagnosis, and for early
determination of efficacy of therapy. Markers associated
with melanoma include circulating tumor cells in blood
547

Oncotarget 2010; 1: 544 - 551

[61], and molecular markers for tumor progression [62].
Apoptosis of cancer cells releases biomarkers into blood
including postranslational modifications of proteins
[63], which can be detected in very small non-invasive
samples [64]. miRNAs in cancers are changed [65].
Urine of prostate cancer patients contains an siRNA
biomarker; pooled samples were analyzed by differential
display for selection of the most frequently changed
biomarkers . Pooling should be valuable for finding
frequently expressed potential oncotargets and to simplify
research effort [66]. Biomarkers for colon and pancreatic
cancers are found in fecal samples. Techniques for
biomarker discovery include genome sequencing, arrays
and differential display-related methods, proteins and
phosphoproteins, antibodies, electrophoretic 2D gels, and
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy [67].

The quantity and complexity of information about
cancer presents a problem. Creation of cell phenotypes
involves activities and regulation of groups of genes.
More than one mutation is usually needed to make a hit,
oncotargets are likely to act in sets, multi-drug combinations
are superior to a single drug [68]. Comprehensive therapy
based on oncotarget research should be bases on complex
system models [69]. Systems biology is an approach to
quantitate and visualize the massive information that links
molecular biological pathways and their regulations. This
modeling could provide a basis for studies of defective
controls in cancers [70]. Negative and positive feedback
loops [71] and bifan switching mechanism [72] have been
discovered in cell signaling networks [73]. These can
identify oncotargets as for metastasis [74] and for drug
discovery [75].They are incorporated in stem cell systems
[76].
Models of differentiation of normal cells from stem
cells and regulations of their phenotypic changes [77]
could be constructed based on systems biology . Pattern
formation in oogenesis provides a dramatic example [78]
Systems biology could move “reductionism” [79] into
general biology [80]: ‘Nature’ is regulated by ‘Nurture’.
