ABSTRACT
The results of recent studies investigating the role of platinum-based
chemotherapy (PBCT) in metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) were
conflicting. We retrospectively investigated a large cohort (n = 379) of mTNBC to
re-evaluate the role of platinums. Longer PFS was found in patients with PBCT than
those with non-PBCT (7.8 vs. 4.9 months, P < 0.001) as first-line chemotherapy,
but no statistical difference of OS was observed. Compared with other kinds of
platinum, cisplatin-based regimens as the first-line chemotherapy showed better PFS
(8.0 vs. 4.3 months, P = 0.03) and better ORR. Introduction of ≥2 lines, rather than
1 line, of PBCT can result in better OS when compared with no introduction of PBCT
during the whole treatment. If considering the timing of intervention of PBCT, firstline introduction and later line introduction of PBCT did not make any difference in OS
among patients with only one line PBCT during the whole treatment. We concluded
that PBCT with only 1 line during the whole treatment might not be necessary for
unselected mTNBC with the exception of an urgent demand to control disease or
symptoms, however, ≥2 lines of PBCT did prolong OS.

TNBC varies from 16–42% and IHC-based studies classify
80–90% of BRCA1-associated tumors as TNBC and/
or BLBC [13, 14]. Due to these similarities, it has been
hypothesized that the DNA repair defects that sensitize
BRCA-mutated and BRCA-like breast cancer tumors to
platinum may also be present in TNBC, indicating that
platinum-based chemotherapy (PBCT) may be an effective
treatment option for this subset of breast cancer [15].
During the past few years, several studies have
been conducted to study the role of PBCT in the mTNBC
setting, but results were conflicting. Some data support
the use of platinum (mainly cisplatin-based) [16–18].
While some are discouraging, for example, the TNT study
compared carboplatin to docetaxel therapy in unselectted
metastatic or recurrent locally advanced TNBC or
BRCA1/2 positive breast cancer but similar efficacy
was observed in terms of overall response rate (ORR
[31.4% vs. 35.6%, p = 0.44]), PFS (3.1 vs. 4.5 months,
p = 0.29) and overall survival (OS [12.4 vs. 12.3 months,
p = 0.31]) [19]. Even with a first-line gemcitabine
and carboplatin combination regimen, PFS was only

INTRODUCTION
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) which
accounts for ~12–20% of all breast cancers is a clinical
challenge as this subtype is associated with an increased
rate of recurrence, shorter disease-free intervals (DFI),
earlier visceral metastasis, and poorer survival compared
with other breast cancer subtypes [1, 2]. The median
survival for metastatic TNBC (mTNBC) ranges from
6 to 13.3 months [3–6]. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is
the mainstay treatment for mTNBC and no dedicated
biological agents are available. Targeted therapies
including DNA repair agents, PARP or EGFR inhibitors,
anti-angiogenic agents, or checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1)
inhibitors (with or without chemotherapy) have not
substantially improved mTNBC outcomes [7, 8].
Gene expression analysis demonstrates that the
molecular signature of TNBC generally overlaps with
basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), with concordance rates
of 70–90% [9–12], TNBC is also associated with BRCArelated breast cancer. The incidence of BRCA mutations in

4.6 months, which did not appear significantly superior to
historical data [6, 20]. Likely, cisplatin is more efficacious
than carboplatin [21, 22]. We need more evidence in
unselected mTNBC patients to confirm that PBCT is
more efficacious than non-PBCT, and whether these
differences are due to types of platinums, and whether
later-line treatment with platinums influence OS. We
then retrospectively reviewed a large cohort of mTNBC
patients at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center
(FUSCC) to re-evaluate of the role of platinums and
compared potential prognostic factors for first-line ORR
and PFS and OS.

OS was observed between these two groups (median OS,
19.6 months vs. 19.2 months, P = 0.82).
Compared with other forms of platinum, cisplatinbased regimens (cisplatin + taxanes/vinorelbine/
gemcitabine) as first-line chemotherapy offered better
PFS (median PFS, 8.0 months vs. 4.3 months, P = 0.03;
Fig. 1C) and better ORR (59.6% vs. 35.0%, P = 0.03), but
no benefit to OS was observed (median OS, 25.1 months
vs. 19.6 months, P = 0.69).
A numerical but not a significant difference was
observed (median OS, 20.3 months vs. 15.7 months,
P = 0.87) in terms of OS between patients with an
introduction and those with no introduction of PBCT
during treatment. However, more lines of intervention
with PBCT offered better OS outcomes. For all 379
patients, those who received 2 or more lines of PBCT
in their metastatic setting had longer OS than those
who received none or only one line of PBCT (median
OS, 25.1 months vs. 17.2 months, P = 0.02; Fig. 1D).
This advantage remained with the 309 patients with
PBCT in the metastatic setting, and better OS was seen
for those with ≥2 lines of PBCT compared to those with
only one line of PBCT (median OS, 25.1 months vs.
17.2 months, P = 0.01). Regarding timing of the PBCT
intervention, first-line and later line introduction of PBCT
was not different with respect to OS (20.2 months vs.
15.6 months, P = 0.15) among patients with only one line
of PBCT during the treatment.
Other variables significantly influencing PFS
in the univariate analysis included ECOG score, time
between breast surgery and number of metastatic organ
sites. Besides receiving ≥2 lines of PBCT, the univariate
analysis also indicated that post-menopausal, time between
breast surgery ≥12 months, no visceral metastasis and
less number of metastatic organ sites were significantly
associated with longer OS. Previous use of platinum as
adjuvant or neo-adjuvant did not significantly influence the
PFS or ORR of first-line chemotherapy in the metastatic
setting (median PFS, 5.1 months vs. 6.9 months, P = 0.29;
ORR, 47.1% vs. 47.6%, P = 0.95).

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
Between July 2000 and March 2014, patients
having received at least one line of chemotherapy in the
metastatic setting, including 309 of 379 patients (81.5%)
who received one or more platinum-based regimens and
70 patients (18.5%) who received non-platinum regimens,
were identified from our database. Table 1 depicts their
characteristics and treatments. Therapies administrated
were summarized in Table 2.
Among the 364 patients with available PFS data,
218 received PBCT as their first line chemotherapy
for mTNBC and 146 patients received non-PBCT
correspondingly. The median follow-up was 15.9 months
(range, 2.0–127.4 months) by the time of data lock
(March 20, 2014). As the date of data cut off, 319 events
of disease progression among the 364 patients as first line
chemotherapy and 267 deaths in total of the 379 had been
observed, with 5 patients (1.3%) were lost to follow-up.
Ninety percent patients received neo-adjuvant or adjuvant
chemotherapy. Prior exposure rates were 78.7% to
anthracyclines and 57.0% to taxanes, with 9.5% exposed
to platinum in the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting.
Table 2 summarizes therapies in the metastatic setting with
respect to types and strategies for PBCT used. On average,
mTNBC patients received 2.7 lines of chemotherapy in the
metastatic setting (range, 1–9).

Factors independently predicting treatment
outcome
Using a binary logistic regression model, only
first-line PBCT (HR, 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 – 0.61; P < 0.001)
was identified as independent factors for predicting firstline ORR.
Cox proportional hazards model was used to
determine the hazard ratios of the above-mentioned
variables for predicting the risk of disease progression
or death for mTNBC patients in the first-line setting.
Event-free survival was set as a dependent variable, and
parameters for which P < 0.1 in the univariate analysis
were independent variables. Forward selection based on a
maximum likelihood ratio (Forward LR) was used as the
regression method.

Response and survival
By the time of data lock, the median OS of all
379 patients was 19.7 months (95% CI, 17.2 to 22.1).
Among the 364 patients with available first-line data,
the median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI, 6.1 to 7.7)
(Fig. 1A), with the ORR of 47.5% (26 CR, 147 PR).
Longer PFS observed in patients with PBCT compared
to those with non-PBCT (median PFS, 7.8 months vs.
4.9 months, P < 0.001) as first-line chemotherapy for
mTNBC (Fig. 1B). The ORR was also statistically higher
in the first-line PBCT group than in the non-PBCT group
(57.3% vs. 32.9%, P < 0.001). No statistical difference in

PBCT used as first-line chemotherapy (HR, 0.63,
95% CI 0.47 – 0.84; P = 0.002) together with ECOG score,
number of metastatic organ sites, and time between breast
surgery were observed to be independent predictive factors
for PFS. We also found that cisplatin-based  regimens
were independent predictive factors for  first-line PFS
in the PBCT subgroup (HR, 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 – 0.99;
P = 0.046) (Table 3).
Regarding OS, lines of PBCT (<2 line vs. ≥2 lines,
HR, 0.73, 95% CI 0.56 – 0.94; P = 0.016) together with
number of metastatic organ sites, and time between
breast surgery were independent predictive factors for OS
(Table 3).

platinums and different patient ethnicities may contribute
to these differences. Not including the phase II study by
Fan [17] which studied a relatively small sample size, OS
benefits were not gained with first-line PBCT in our study
and the TNT trial. For CBCSG006, although OS data
are immature, death events were almost equal between
arms. We do agree that post-progression crossover to the
PBCT might contribute to no differences observed in OS
because our study indicated that OS was not significantly
influenced by the timing (early or late) of introduction
of platinum for patients with only one line PBCT during
the whole treatment. However, OS did not differ between
groups with PBCT introduced or not during treatment,
suggesting that re-evaluating the role of platinums in
mTNBC is needed. For mTNBC patients with more
extensive, rapidly progressive, or symptomatic disease,
PBCT was preferred because—even without improved
OS—PBCT appeared to offer more symptom control and
allowed later line treatments. Identification of predictive
markers for PBCT and population enrichment with those
who benefit from PBCT should prolong OS for mTNBC
patients.
Cisplatin-based regimens appeared to be
significantly more efficacious than other platinum types as
a first-line therapy in our study. Both PFS (8.0 months vs.
4.3 months) and ORR (59.6% vs. 35%) were comparable
to data from the two phase III trials (TNT and CBCSG006)
and other previous studies, findings which support our
data. Compared with carboplatin, cisplatin has superior
efficacy as a neo-adjuvant for locally advanced TNBC,
with more patients achieving a pathological complete
response and significant improvement in OS [22]. Also in
the metastatic setting, more patients respond to cisplatin
than carboplatin [21].
An important finding in our study was that more
lines of PBCT improved OS and reduced the risk of
death by 27% according to a Cox hazards model. Patients
who received ≥2 lines of PBCT had a median OS more
than 2 years (25.1 months), which suggested that the
cumulative effect of better PFS from different lines of
PBCT might ultimately result in longer OS.

DISCUSSION
The controversy over the role of platinums in
mTNBC persists, so we retrospectively re-evaluated this
concept in a patient population, focusing on first-line
and later line therapy. We found that PBCT, especially a
cisplatin-based regimen, was significantly more effective
than non-PBCT strategies in terms of PFS and ORR during
first-line therapy in a metastatic setting, but OS did not
improve. Also, no significant difference was observed in
OS whether PBCT was introduced or not during treatment.
Early and late introduction of PBCT did not influence
OS, but more treatment lines (≥2) of PBCT significantly
lengthened OS.
Both BRCA-associated breast cancer and sporadic
triple-negative or basal-like breast cancers have
characteristics consistent with abnormal DNA repair and
genome-wide instability [23, 24], which lends support to
the use of DNA-damaging compounds such as platinums.
That PBCT yielded higher response and longer PFS than
non-PBCT in our study established this concept and was
in accordance with data from the phase II study by Fan’s
group [17] and the prospective phase III CBCSG006 [18].
Similar to our study, these two trials were based on Asian
population. Differences in data from the TNT trial [19]
which compared carboplatin with docetaxel and mainly
included western populations suggest different types of

Multivariate analysis confirmed that PBCT used as
first-line chemotherapy was an independent predictive
factor for PFS. For patients with first-line PBCT, a
cisplatin-based regimen was a favorable predictive factor
for longer first-line PFS. These data confirmed a potential
role for platinums to treat mTNBC but they have not
been confirmed to predict better OS. Through molecular
profiling, TNBC was identified to be a disease of many
intrinsic molecular subtypes (basal-like, claudin-low
or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]enriched) [25]. The high heterogeneity of TNBC suggests
that platinums used to treat unselected mTNBC patients to
improve OS may not be a good strategy. Application of the
PAM50 intrinsic subtype signature to sub-classify TNBC
groups as basal- and non-basal-like, or a determination
of the status of BRCA1, BRCA2 and BRCAness may be
better for testing platinums but this requires future study.
Our study is limited by its retrospective nature
and potential patient and treatment selection biases, its
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inclusion of one institution and the fact that different
baseline information as well as various intrinsic molecular
subtypes of TNBC might lead to clinical heterogeneity. In
addition, the impossibility to retrieve enough information
to analyze the safety profile and tolerability of these PBCT
regimens should be considered, with the solely exception
of a fraction of patients treated in the most recent years,
owing to the wide time window considered. Based on
currently available, albeit incomplete, data we did not
observe any unexpected warnings in terms of toxicity and
adherence to these PBCT therapies. Even so, our study is
the first and the largest re-evaluation of the role of PBCT
in first-line and later line settings.
In conclusion, compared with non-PBCT, PBCT
especially cisplatin-based regimens using at the first
line can significantly improve ORR and PFS, but cannot
improve OS. PBCT with only 1 line during the whole
treatment might not be necessary for unselected mTNBC
with the exception of an urgent demand to control disease

the first-line treatment to death by any cause or censored at
the last date the patient was known to be alive.
One of the objectives of this study was to establish
prognostic factors for outcomes in TNBC patients who
received PBCT. Data for clinical variables identified through
literature review were collected as potential important
predictors of ORR, PFS and OS in mTNBC patients.
Potential prognostic variables collected at the time of
diagnosis of distant metastases or the beginning of treatment
included age, menstruation status, details about neo-adjuvant
and adjuvant chemotherapy administered, distant diseasefree interval, and number and sites of metastatic disease.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patient selection
Retrospective analysis was conducted within a
cohort of mTNBC patients who received PBCT or nonPBCT at FUSCC between July 2000 and March 2014.
Data were collected from electronic patient records
and hospital charts. Study procedures were approved
by institutional ethical board of FUSCC. The eligible
patients were ≥ 18 years old and had TNBC histologically
confirmed at the primary tumor, with clinical, imaging,
histological or cytological evidence of metastatic disease.
Patients were classified as TNBC based on their surgical or
biopsy results, histologically confirmed estrogen receptor
(ER)-, progesterone receptor (PR)-, and HER2- were
defined as follows: ER- and PR- were defined as < 1%
positive tumor cells immunohistochemical nuclear
staining and HER2- was defined as having an IHC score
of 0 or 1+ or a FISH non-amplified score according to
ASCO guidelines. Patients with incomplete receptor status
or changed status in metastatic lesions inconsistent with
the definition described above were excluded.

Statistical analysis
Results were analyzed using SPSS 16.0 (SPSS,
Chicago, IL). Binary logistic regression model was
used to identify the factors that independently influence
first-line ORR. Cox proportional hazards models were
used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs
of disease progression or death. The models were adjusted
for age, menstruation status, prior adjuvant and neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy, site and extent of first distant relapse, and
presence of visceral metastasis. Median PFS and OS were
all estimated by the Kaplan–Meier method and compared
using a log-rank test. Response rates of different regimens
were compared using a chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact
test. All P values were two sided, P < 0.05 was considered
to indicate a statistically significant difference.

Data collection
The efficacy of PBCT and non-PBCT was analyzed
according to ORR, PFS, and OS. Tumor response was
evaluated in accordance with the Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) guidelines by
computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance
imaging if indicated. The date of disease progression
was determined from the clinical notes. PFS was defined
as the time from the start of the treatment until disease
progression or death. OS was calculated from the start of
