ABSTRACT
Almost 50% of metastatic melanoma patients harbor a BRAFV600 mutation and the
introduction of BRAF inhibitors has improved their treatment options. BRAF inhibitors
vemurafenib and dabrafenib achieved improved overall survival over chemotherapy
and have been approved for the treatment of BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma.
However, most patients develop mechanisms of acquired resistance and about 15%
of them do not achieve tumor regression at all, due to intrinsic resistance to therapy.
Moreover, early adaptive responses limit the initial efficacy of BRAF inhibition, leading
mostly to incomplete responses that may favor the selection of a sub-population of
resistant clones and the acquisition of alterations that cause tumor regrowth and
progressive disease.
The purpose of this paper is to review the mechanisms of resistance to therapy
with BRAF inhibitors and to discuss the strategies to overcome them based on preclinical and clinical evidences.

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this paper is to review the
mechanisms of resistance to therapy with BRAFi and to
discuss the strategies to overcome them based on preclinical and clinical evidence.

Almost 50% of metastatic melanoma patients
harbor a BRAFV600 mutation and the introduction of
BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) has improved their treatment
options [1-3]. BRAFi vemurafenib and dabrafenib have
been approved for the treatment of BRAFV600-mutated
metastatic melanoma. In a recent update of the Phase III
study of vemurafenib [2], median overall survival (OS)
and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly
longer in the vemurafenib group than in the dacarbazine
group (OS: 13.6 vs 9.7 months; PFS: 6.9 vs 1.6 months).
In the Phase III study of dabrafenib vs dacarbazine [3],
median PFS was 6.9 months compared with 2.7 months
and also median OS was significantly longer (18.2 vs 15.6
months). However, most patients treated with BRAFi
develop mechanisms of acquired resistance and about 15%
of them do not achieve tumor regression at all [2,3].

Signaling Pathways in BRAF-mutated Melanoma
The RTK-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling cascade
(Figure 1). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of
melanoma. RAF kinases ARAF, BRAF and CRAF are
key components of the pathway, which is physiologically
activated when extracellular signals bind to their cognate
membrane receptor, typically a receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTK). In the absence of such signal, RAF kinases are in
an inactive conformation, with the N terminus inhibiting
the catalytic C terminus. In the presence of an upstream
10206

stimulus, RAS-GTP binds RAF at its N-terminus, relieving
its auto-inhibition. The activity of wild-type RAF proteins
requires the formation of homo- and heterodimers, which
is promoted by RAS activation. In addition, RAF proteins
require chaperone or scaffold proteins, such as heat shock
protein 90 and the adaptor protein 14-3-3, which stabilize
their structure [4].
Activated RAF kinases phosphorylate and activate
MEK1/2, which in turn activate ERK1/2. ERK regulates
cellular proliferation, survival and differentiation; the
activation of ERK is regulated by a complex network
of negative-feedback interactions through direct
phosphorylation of the components of the RTK-RASMAPK cascade by ERK and through the induction of
genes which inhibit activation of the pathway, such as
Sprouty (SPRY) proteins and dual-specifity phosphatases
(DUSPs) [4].
BRAFV600 mutations (Figure 2). About 50% of
melanomas harbor an activating mutation in BRAF,
the most common being BRAFV600E [1], which renders
the kinase constitutively active. In contrast to wildtype BRAF, the mutated forms of BRAF are active
as monomers. In BRAF-mutated melanomas, RAS
is negatively regulated by ERK-dependent feedback:
BRAF-mutated cells have hyperactive ERK signaling and
elevated ERK-dependent transcriptional output, including
negative-feedback components. Feedback suppression
takes place at multiple levels downstream of RTKs: as
a result, RAS expression is low in BRAF-mutated cells
and BRAFV600E exists mainly as a monomer, which is not
dependent on RAS-GTP induced dimerization [5]. In
addition, ERK negative feedback substantially attenuates

PI3K/AKT signaling [5].
BRAF inhibition. BRAFi vemurafenib inhibits
different RAF kinases with different half-maximum
inhibitory concentrations: 10 nM for BRAF V600E, 15
nM for CRAF, 35 nM for ARAF and 40 nM for wildtype BRAF [6]. Vemurafenib inhibits ERK signaling
only in BRAF-mutated tumors, while wild-type BRAF
tumors and, especially, those with RAS mutations show a
paradoxical activation of ERK due to the transactivation
of RAF dimers [6]. In fact, in wild-type cells, BRAF and
CRAF form homo- and heterodimers on RAS activation;
vemurafenib binding to one member of the dimer causes
an allosteric transactivation of the drug-free protomer
and activation of MEK/ERK. The activation of MEK/
ERK is enhanced when RAS is overexpressed [6]: this
is consistent with the pre-clinical evidence that activated
RAS promotes the dimerization of RAF and with the
clinical evidence of RAS mutations in most cutaneous
squamous cell carcinomas and keratoacanthomas which
develop in patients treated with BRAFi [7]. In contrast, the
activity of RAS in BRAF-mutated cells is low due to ERK
negative-feedback signaling and insufficient to promote
RAF dimerization: as a result, RAF exists predominantly
as a monomer which responds to selective BRAFi. The
relief of ERK negative-feedback during treatment with
BRAFi may play a role in the mechanisms of resistance to
BRAF inhibition and it will be discussed later.
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (Figure 1).
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR kinase cascade is triggered by
RTKs and G-protein-coupled receptors situated at the
cell surface. When binding their extracellular ligands,
these receptors sequester the regulatory subunit of

Figure 1: Under physiological conditions, ERK signaling
is regulated by extracellular signals binding to receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Activated RTKs promote RASmediated dimerization of RAF; wild-type RAF, as hetero- or
homodimers, phosphorylate and activate MEK1/2, which in turn
phosphorylate and activate ERK1/2. Activated ERK promote
cell cycle progression and proliferation and negatively regulates
upstream signaling components (negative feedback). RTKs also
regulate the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. The two pathways
interact at multiple points: most importantly, RAS directly binds
and activates PI3K.

Figure 2: In BRAF-mutated cells, BRAFV600E is constitutively

active as a monomer, leading to high ERK signaling and elevated
ERK-dependent transcriptional output, including negativefeedback components. As a result, RAS expression is low and
does not promote RAF dimerization, and PI3K/AKT signaling is
substantially attenuated.

Clinical evidence suggests that activating RAC1
mutations may confer resistance to BRAFi: in a cohort
of 45 patients treated with BRAFi, among 14 patients
exhibiting intrinsic resistance, three pretreatment sample
harbored RAC1P29S mutations, and in one of them there
was no other alteration known to confer resistance to
therapy; no patient who achieved response to therapy
harbored this mutation (P=0.026) [12].
RAC1 effectors include various protein kinases,
offering a target for pharmacological inhibition, which
may be of therapeutic value in the treatment of melanomas
harboring the RAC1P29S mutations, although experimental
evidence in support of this hypothesis is necessary.
Loss of PTEN. PTEN functions as a tumor
suppressor by inhibiting PI3K signaling [13]. Loss
of PTEN, which is observed in 10-33% of melanoma
specimens [14-16], may contribute to intrinsic resistance
to BRAFi via increased PI3K/AKT signaling when BRAF
is inhibited and suppression of apoptosis mediated by
proapoptotic protein BIM, member of the Bcl-2 protein
family [14]. It is likely that loss of PTEN alone is not
sufficient to confer resistance to BRAFi, but only when
it is concurrent with other alterations. In fact, even if
AKT activation is sufficient to provide resistance to
vemurafenib-mediated apoptosis [17], PTEN loss is not
always well correlated with increased AKT activation
[14] and responses have been observed even in patients
with complete loss of PTEN [12,18]. Nevertheless, cell
lines with functional inactivation of PTEN seem to be
less sensitive to BRAFi than wild-type PTEN melanoma
cells and this was also observed in the clinical setting. In
a study by Nathanson et al. [16], patients with wild-type
PTEN treated with BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib had longer
PFS compared with patients with at least one mutated
allele of PTEN (32.1 vs 18.3 weeks; p=0.066), and a
modest association between low expression of PTEN
and lower response was observed in the phase 2 study of
vemurafenib as well [18].
Dual BRAF/PI3K inhibition restores apoptosis in
PTEN null cells [14], suggesting that such combination
may overcome this mechanism of resistance.
Dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)
and/or cyclin D1. Cyclin D1 regulates proliferation binding
both CDK4 and CDK6, which in turn phosphorylate the
retinoblastoma protein and lead to progression through
the cell cycle. Under physiologic conditions, p16INK4A
(encoded by CDKN2A) negatively regulates CDK4
function [19]. Smalley and colleagues [19] found that
CDK4 mutations alone did not alter responsiveness
to BRAF inhibition, while cyclin D1 overexpression
alone increased resistance. Cell lines harboring both a
CDK4 mutation and a CCND1 (cyclin D1) amplification
were the most resistant to therapy with BRAFi. This is
clinically relevant given that CCND1 is amplified in 17%
of BRAFV600E-mutated metastatic melanoma samples [19].
This pre-clinical model is supported by some clinical

PI3K, allowing the catalytic subunit to catalyze the
phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate
(PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3).
PIP3 activates downstream signaling components,
including the protein kinase AKT, and it is antagonized
by the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN). AKT phosphorylates many survival, proliferation
and motility factors, including the tuberous sclerosis
protein complex 1 (TSC1) and TSC2, which in turn lead
to activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), a key
regulator of cellular growth and protein synthesis [8,9].
PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK
pathway cross-talk. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/
RAF/MEK/ERK pathways interact at multiple points,
resulting in cross-activation, cross-inhibition, and pathway
convergence. Most importantly, RAS directly binds and
activates PI3K; in addition, ERK phosphorylates TSC2,
activating mTORC1. Cross-inhibition between the
two pathways may occur under certain circumstances;
for example, under high insulin-like growth factor 1
(IGF1) stimulation, AKT can inhibit RAF activity by
phosphorylating its regulatory domain [8,9].

Mechanisms of Resistance
Numerous mechanisms of resistance have been
predicted and detected based on in vitro and in vivo
models and many of them have been confirmed on preand post-treatment tumor samples (Table 1). Resistant
tumors may arise under selective pressure of therapy
from pre-existing resistant subclones or as a result of an
evolutionary process during treatment, or a combination of
both. A detailed understanding of the causes of resistance
to BRAFi is necessary to develop more effective treatment
strategies. These mechanisms are largely classifiable
as either primary/intrinsic, when no clinical benefit is
achieved, or secondary/acquired, when progressive disease
is observed after a clinical benefit. Moreover, mechanisms
of adaptive resistance arise early during exposure to
BRAFi and may explain why clinical responses to therapy
are mostly partial responses, with complete response rate
being in the range of only 3-6% in the Phase III studies
[2,3].

Mechanisms of Primary/Intrinsic Resistance
RAC1P29S mutations. RAC1 is a RAS-related
GTPase that regulates cell proliferation and migration
[10,11]; RAC1P29S is a recurrent UV-signature mutation in
cutaneous non-acral melanomas and was the third most
frequent activating mutation (9.2%) after those of BRAF
and NRAS in a large cohort (n=147) of exome-sequenced
melanomas [11]. The RAC1P29S mutation was less frequent,
but not mutually exclusive, in NRAS or BRAF mutated
melanomas (6.2% vs 12.5%).

evidence: higher copy number of CCND1 (P=0.009) and
lower copy number of CDKN2A (P=0.012) at baseline
were significantly and independently associated with
decreased PFS upon treatment with dabrafenib [16],
evidencing the importance of the RB1 (retinoblastoma
protein) pathway, which may become a target within a
combination approach.
Loss of NF1. NF1 functions as a tumor suppressor
by inhibiting RAS. Functional inactivation of NF1 leads to
activation of the signaling pathways downstream of RAS,
including PI3K/AKT and MAPK. Inactivating mutations
in NF1 are present in 4% of BRAF-mutated melanomas
[20]. NF1 may not only cooperate with BRAF mutations
to drive melanomagenesis, but also have a role in the
mechanism of primary and secondary resistance to BRAF
inhibitors [21-24]. In vivo studies suggest that combined
MEK and mTOR inhibition [23] and the use of ERK and
irreversible RAF inhibitors (such as AZ628) [22] may
be strategies to overcome or delay this mechanism of
resistance.
COT expression. COT activates ERK primarily
through MEK-dependent mechanisms that do not require
RAF signaling. COT over-expression was identified as
a driver of primary and secondary resistance to BRAF
inhibition in cell lines and in progressing tumors of
patients treated with BRAFi [25].
Alterations in RTK signaling (stromal secretion of
HGF). The addition of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to
BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines confer resistance to
BRAFi [26], hence stromal cells producing large amounts
of HGF may be responsible for intrinsic resistance to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

therapy with BRAFi [27]. This mechanism of resistance
is mediated by the activation of HGF receptor c-MET
and subsequent activation of both the MAPK and PI3KAKT signaling pathways and is sensitive, in vitro and in a
xenograft model, to c-MET and HGF inhibition [26,27].
The combination of a BRAFi with a MEK inhibitor is
unlikely to overcome this mechanism of resistance, since
the PI3K-AKT pathway is involved as well, whereas the
addition of an AKT inhibitor led to the suppression of the
majority of HGF-induced resistance in vitro [27]. Patients
with high baseline HGF serum levels have reduced
response rate, PFS and OS [26,27].
HOXD8 mutations. HOXD8 is a homeobox
transcription factor dysregulated in multiple cancers
[12,28]. The detection in a non-responder patient treated
with BRAF inhibitors of a nonsense mutation in the
HOXD8 gene in the absence of other known resistanceassociated alterations suggested that inactivation of this
transcription factor may be a cause of intrinsic resistance.

Mechanisms of Secondary/Acquired Resistance
Most mechanisms of acquired resistance involve
a reactivation of the MAPK pathway due to events that
can occur upstream, downstream or at the level of BRAF;
the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway constitutes a second core
resistance pathway, which often overlaps with the MAPK
pathway. Notably, no gatekeeper mutations have been
identified as drivers of acquired resistance. Among 56
progressive tumors samples, deep sequencing of all 18

BRAF exons revealed no BRAFV600E/K secondary mutations
and confirmed the persistence of the same BRAFV600E/K
mutation in all progressive tumors, demonstrating that
BRAFi did not select for minor, preexisting wild-type
clones [29]; this was confirmed by another study [30]
demonstrating intrapatient homogeneity of BRAFV600E
assessed with immunohistochemistry in 171 tumors from
64 patients.
BRAF-mutant melanomas may develop multiple
mechanisms of resistance simultaneously, even within a
single cell line, and some of them may drive resistance to
multiple MAPK inhibitors [31]. In a study on 100 resistant
tumor samples from 44 patients [29], an alteration in the
MAPK pathway was detected in 70% of the progressive
tumors, while alterations of the PI3K –AKT pathway
were detected in 22%; in 20% of patients, at least two
mechanisms of resistance were detected in the same
patient, and the alterations involved both pathways in all
cases except for one; 13/16 patients, from whom multiple
progressive biopsies were available, harbored multiple
mechanisms of resistance. In another study [12], 3/45
patients harbored multiple independent mechanisms of
resistance within the same tumor biopsy.
No association was observed between clinical
outcome (best response and PFS) and specific mechanisms
of resistance [32].

drug holiday could restore sensitivity when resistance is
driven by this mechanism [36].
NRAS Mutations. MAPK reactivation due to high
levels of activating mutations of NRAS was identified in
2010 by Nazarian and colleagues [33]. This model was
validated by the detection of NRAS mutations in 4 of 19
tumor samples with acquired resistance to vemurafenib
[38], underlying the importance that this mechanism has
in the clinical setting. A combination strategy targeting
downstream of NRAS, such as MEK and ERK, and the
PI3K/AKT pathway should overcome this resistance
mechanism.
Alternative splicing of V600E BRAF. Poulikakos
et al. [38] detected from in vitro-resistant cell lines a 61kDa form of V600E BRAF (p61BRAFV600E), which lacked
exons 4–8, a region encoding the RAS-binding domain
of BRAF, critical for RAF activation. In cells expressing
p61BRAFV600E ERK signaling is resistant to BRAFi. The
resistance of p61BRAFV600E to vemurafenib is not due to
its inability to bind the inhibitor, but because this variant
forms dimers in a RAS-independent manner, strongly
activating MEK and ERK in the presence of BRAFi [38].
The use of BRAFi in combination with MEK or ERK
inhibitors should delay or prevent this mechanism of
resistance, as p61BRAFV600E cells should retain sensitivity
to inhibitors of downstream components of the pathway.
Nevertheless, an alternative splice variant of BRAF has
also been detected in 1/5 patients after treatment with
dabrafenib and trametinib in combination [39], raising
the notion that this kind of combination may not be
effective in this subset of patients. Pre-clinical evidence
indicates that PLX7904, a next-generation BRAFi, blocks
the growth of vemurafenib-resistant BRAFV600E cells
harboring distinct BRAFV600E splice variants [40], so this
drug may become a treatment option in this subset of
resistant tumors.
BRAFV600E copy number amplification. BRAFV600E
copy number gain, which results in BRAFV600E overexpression, is sufficient to lead to ERK reactivation
in a RAS and CRAF-independent manner [41]. This
alteration has been detected in 8-20% of tumor samples
after PD with BRAFi [12,16,29,41]. ERK reactivation is
saturable with higher doses of BRAFi and is sensitive in
vitro to MEK inhibition and combined BRAF and MEK
inhibition. Nonetheless, BRAF amplification has also
been detected in patients after treatment with BRAF and
MEK inhibitors in combination [39], pointing out that a
combination approach with only these two drugs may not
be sufficient to overcome this mechanism of resistance
in the clinical setting. Dose-escalation may re-achieve
disease control in patients with BRAF copy number gain;
since the maximum tolerated dose of dabrafenib has not
been determined, with doses up to 300 mg twice daily
being tested in a Phase 1 study [42], the feasibility of dose
escalation trials with dabrafenib in combination with a
MEKi should be assessed in this subset of patients.

Upregulation and activation of the RTKs.
Activation of RTKs may drive resistance through the
activation of parallel pathways or increasing RAS
activity. Upregulation and activation of the plateletderived growth factor receptor b (PDGFRb) was one of
the first alteration identified as an acquired mechanism of
resistance to BRAFi treatment [33]. In vitro, the PDGFRb
cells were insensitive to the PDGFR inhibitor imatinib
[34]; however, resistant cells should be sensitive to the
combined inhibition of BRAF and the RTK-PI3K-AKTmTORC pathway [35].
Moreover, immunohistochemistry analysis on 16
pre- and post-treatment samples of metastatic melanoma
patients receiving BRAFi (15/16) or MEKi (1/16)
revealed that 6 progressing tumor samples acquired
EGFR expression. EGFR is not expressed, in general, by
melanoma cells, and in vitro studies concluded that EGFR
expression is disadvantageous for BRAFV600E melanoma
cells in the absence of BRAF or MEK inhibitor drugs, but
it confers a selective advantage in the presence of these
drugs. The addition of an EGFR inhibitor to vemurafenib
did not lead to inhibition of cell proliferation, as other
drivers of drug resistance, such as RTKs PDGFRB and
ERBB3, were implicated. Many RTKs share the RASMEK-ERK and the PI3K-AKT signaling pathways:
consistent with this, dual inhibition of the two pathways
could restore sensitivity to BRAFi in cells with high EGFR
expression [36,37]. Acquired EGFR expression is reversed
in the absence of the BRAFi, providing evidence that a

Activating MEK1/2 mutations. Activating MEK1
and MEK2 mutations may confer resistance in a small
percentage of cases [12,18,32,43-45]: a number of
different mutations have been identified and only some of
them are capable to drive resistance to BRAFi, while the
others did not alter sensitivity to BRAFi in vitro and did
not prevent tumor regressions in the clinical setting (see
Table 1 for details). MEK mutations driving resistance
to BRAFi may as well confer cross-resistance to MEKi,
raising the possibility that BRAF and MEK inhibitors
in combination may have limited efficacy in this setting
[12,39], while most of these mutations remain sensitive to
ERK inhibitors (ERKi) in vitro [12,46-47].
Elevated CRAF levels. Elevated CRAF protein
levels have been associated with increased levels of
phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels and may account for the
acquisition of resistance to BRAFi due to increased RAF
dimerization [48]. Elevated CRAF levels seem to reflect
a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism rather than
CRAF gene amplification [48]. In a small subset of BRAF
mutated melanoma patients, this alteration may similarly
contribute to intrinsic resistance [48].
Mutations in PI3K-AKT pathway genes. AKT1/3
mutations and mutations in PI3K-AKT positive-regulatory
genes (PIK3CA and PIK3CG) and negative-regulatory
genes (PIK3R2 and PHLPP1) may up-regulate the PI3KAKT pathway [12,29,32], driving resistance to BRAFi.

and, in most melanomas, is not enough to cause resistance
in the absence of other activating signals, but can cooperate
with mechanisms requiring the presence of active RTK
[4]. In addition, it provides a partial explanation to the
variability of responses observed in patients treated with
BRAFi and it suggests that a combination including an
inhibitor of ERK rebound may be necessary to achieve
more durable and complete responses.
Alterations in the PI3K-PTEN-AKT pathway. The
inhibition of the MAPK pathway leads to early, adaptive
AKT signaling, unleashing a rebound activation of PI3KAKT pathway [49]. AKT activation is normally limited by
the activity of PTEN [13], supporting the hypothesis that
PTEN loss of function has an important role in the failure
of BRAFi therapy. This PI3K-AKT-dependent adaptive
response to BRAFi, along with the high frequency of
melanomas with loss of function of PTEN [14-16] and
other alterations linked to this pathway [12,29,32,49],
indicate that the addition of a PI3K/AKT inhibitor to
MAPK inhibitors may be necessary to obtain a long-term
clinical benefit.
Upregulation of FOXD3. Forkhead box D3
(FOXD3) is a stem cell/pluripotency transcription factor: it
was found to be upregulated following MAPK inhibition,
conferring resistance to cell death [50]. The combination
of BRAFi with integrin inhibitors should overcome this
mechanism of resistance, as the blockade of signals from
the extracellular matrix through treatment with integrin
inhibitors attenuates the upregulation of FOXD3 in vitro
[51]. Moreover, since ERBB3 was identified as a direct
transcriptional target of FOXD3, a combination with
ERBB signaling inhibitors may also have therapeutic
value in this setting [52].
Upregulation of mitochondrial synthesis and
oxidative metabolism. ERK1/2 pathway inhibition
relieves suppression of MITF (microphthalmia-associated
transcription factor), a promoter for cell survival expressed
exclusively in the melanocyte lineage, leading to the
upregulation of mitochondrial synthesis and oxidative
metabolism through PGC1α (peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor γ coactivator 1α) and promoting
survival in the presence of the inhibitor [53-56]. Moreover,
amplification of MITF was reported as a mechanism of
secondary resistance in a resistant tumor biopsy [12].
Overexpression of MITF desensitizes BRAF-mutated
melanoma cells to BRAFi, but MITF expression can be
impaired following treatment with histone deacetylase
inhibitors (HDACi), suggesting the potential benefit of a
combination strategy with MAPK inhibitors. Furthermore,
since BRAFi-induced oxidative metabolism renders
melanoma cells highly dependent on antioxidant enzymes
to survive, the combination with pro-oxidative agents
may be a rational strategy to overcome this mechanism of
resistance [54].

Mechanisms of Adaptive Resistance to BRAF
inhibition
Early adaptive responses to BRAFi, in addition
to limiting the initial efficacy leading to incomplete
responses, may favor the selection of a sub-population
of resistant clones and the acquisition of alterations that
lead to secondary resistance, ultimately causing tumor
regrowth and progressive disease.
Relief of ERK negative-feedback. In BRAFmutated melanoma, ERK-dependent feedback suppress
RAS activation and BRAF exists predominantly as an
active monomer. These cells have decreased sensitivity to
growth factors and the transduction of signal from RTKs
is suppressed. The exposure to a BRAFi produces a relief
of ERK negative feedback, with a consequent enhanced
ability of ligands, including growth factors, to activate
signaling and an increased expression of RAS-GTP,
which promotes the formation of RAF dimers. BRAFi
bind to one component of the dimer and cause an allosteric
activation of the other one. As a result, the relief of ERKdependent negative feedback restores sensitivity to growth
factors and may diminish the effect of BRAFi through the
activation of RAS; however, negative-feedback pathways
are partially restored over time, leading to the formation of
a new steady state of reactivated ERK signaling, and the
level of activation of RAS is variable in different cell lines

DISCUSSION

they are likely to have a narrow therapeutic index: clinical
studies are underway to determine whether ERKi can be
delivered at concentrations that are clinically effective
(NCT01781429, NCT01358331). Nevertheless, ERKi
are likely to have limited efficacy as monotherapy or as
sequential therapy after progression with BRAFi; ERK
inhibition, in fact, causes the relief of the ERK-dependent
negative feedback, leading to activated RAS and PI3K
signaling. Pre-clinical evidences support the notion that
only a combinatorial strategy targeting both ERK and
PI3K/mTOR, if clinically deliverable, may circumvent
BRAFi resistance [61].
Anticipating the emergence of multiple mechanism
of resistance by targeting multiple pathways in a
combinatorial approach may have more success than
an adaptive sequential approach. A mathematical model
developed by Bozic et al. [62] has shown that concurrent
combination therapy is more potent than sequential
combination treatment, even when there are no possible
mutations that can confer cross-resistance; when there
are potential mutations conferring cross-resistance to
two or more agents, combination therapy offers some
chance while there is no chance with a sequential strategy
[62,63]. Although preclinical data suggest that a subset
of resistance mechanisms should respond to MEKi, this
mathematical model is supported in the clinical setting
by the lack of clinical activity of MEKi and BRAFi plus
MEKi in patients previously treated with BRAFi. In
fact, in the phase II study of MEKi trametinib in BRAFmutated patients [64], only minimal clinical activity was
observed as sequential therapy in patients previously
treated with a BRAFi. The lack of clinical activity of
MEKi after progression on single agent BRAFi was
confirmed in another cohort of patients who were treated
after progression with a MEKi or combined BRAF and
MEK inhibitors. No objective responses were observed,
including patients whose mechanism of resistance would
predict a response to downstream inhibition, such as
alternative splicing and amplification of BRAF [32]. The
limited clinical activity of this sequential regimen is most
likely due to intra-patient heterogeneity of resistance
[12,29,65-66], cross-resistance [9,58] and alternative
pathways activation. Heterogeneous tumor clones probably
exist before treatment and cases of tumors developing
multiple mechanisms of resistance have been reported
[33,65,67]. Intratumor and intrapatient heterogeneity is
a challenge for personalized targeted therapies: single
tumor samples may lead to underestimation of the tumor
genomics landscape and adaptive clinical trials involving
the selection of sequential targeted drugs based on the
molecular characteristics of a single progressing biopsy
are unlikely to provide durable responses [68].
Tumor sampling will have an increasing influence
on therapeutic strategies [69]. The analysis of circulating
tumor cells or circulating tumor-derived DNA may provide
a more accurate and complete genetic profile of patient

and MEKi trametinib was a breakthrough in the treatment
of metastatic melanoma, even if their efficacy is limited
by the development of resistance; these inhibitors now
represent key elements to build more effective strategies,
such as sequential and combination regimens with other
inhibitors and/or immunotherapy.
The understanding of the mechanisms of resistance
to BRAFi suggests that stronger anti-tumoral activity
may be achieved targeting multiple pathways. The
combination of dabrafenib with trametinib significantly
increased PFS over dabrafenib alone in a phase II study
[57]. Nevertheless, in vitro experiments suggest that
resistance to BRAFi may confer cross-resistance to MEKi
[9,58] and that most mechanisms of resistance involve an
activation of additional pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/
mTOR, thus the combination of BRAFi only with MEKi,
which targets a single pathway, is unlikely to provide
long-term disease control. In fact, in the phase III study
of dabrafenib+trametinib vs dabrafenib monotherapy,
PFS was only slightly better in the combination arm (9.3
vs 8.8 months) (Long, ASCO 2014: Abstract No. 9011).
This implies that multiple pathways may be needed to be
targeted either in parallel, if not limited by toxicity, or in
series, as part of an intermittent dosing schedule.
Resistant tumors, as mentioned earlier, often show
an activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway; in
fact, in addition to the intrinsic and acquired activating
alterations, the cross talk between the MAPK and PI3K/
AKT pathways results in activation of one pathway when
the other is suppressed [8,59], suggesting that a strategy to
effectively counteract resistance must rely, at least, on the
targeting of both the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathways. Pre-clinical studies pointed out the synergistic
nature of targeting the PI3K/AKT pathway in combination
with either BRAF or MEK inhibitors [35,60] and Phase
I/II trials are evaluating such combination regimens
in patients (Table 2): preliminary data show that these
combinations are tolerated and active in patients with
BRAF-mutated metastatic melanoma [9].
ERKi are in early phase clinical trials and may have
a value for overcoming resistance mechanisms relying on
ERK re-activation. ERKi were more effective than MEKi
at overcoming BRAFi resistance conferred by a number
of mechanisms (BRAF splice variants, NRAS mutations,
MEK mutations, BRAF amplification, RTKs activation) in
vitro [46,61]; however, ERKi did not overcome resistance
mediated by RTK activation in all studies [61], even if
a higher level of MAPK suppression was evidenced
compared to MEKi. ERKi target wild-type kinases, so

tumors compared to single tumor biopsies, allowing a
better choice of treatments for individual patients [13].
Nevertheless, a highly effective method for the detection
and molecular analysis of melanoma circulating cell is yet
to be standardized [70,71].
Until the development of more effective diagnostic
strategies, the detection of the mechanisms of resistance
in clinical practice relies on tumor biopsies. An adaptive
sequential strategy using such an approach will be
investigated in the clinical setting in a phase II study
(NCT01820364) in patients with melanoma who progress
on the BRAFi LGX818. Resistant tumors will be biopsied
and compared with a pretreatment biopsy to identify the
mechanism of resistance. On the basis of the alterations
identified in the tumor samples, a second targeted agent
from a list of MEK, CDK4/ 6, FGFR, PI3K, and c-MET
inhibitors will be added to the regimen.

Tumor heterogeneity may also explain the apparent
contrast between the clinical evidences of continued antiproliferative activity of BRAFi in BRAF-resistant tumors
[72] and the pre-clinical models predicting that in some
cases cessation of BRAFi may lead to regression or slower
progression of resistant tumors [73-75].
Treatment beyond PD may achieve clinical benefits
because sensitive and resistant tumor sub-clones probably
coexist, and the discontinuation of treatment would lead
to faster progression as a result of the proliferation of
sensitive clones [76]. Treatment with BRAFi continued
after PD was associated with prolonged OS compared with
ceasing treatment in a series of 114 patients treated with
BRAFi within Phase I-II-III-IV trials [72]; moreover, in
the Phase I study of vemurafenib, 14 patients with isolated
PD in a site suitable for local therapy continued treatment
beyond progression until systemic progression and, some
10215

Oncotarget

of them, achieved long-term survival (Kim, Society for
Melanoma Research 2012 Congress). These data may
be biased by patient selection and future prospective
randomized trials are needed to assess the efficacy of
treatment beyond progression.
In contrast, apparently, with these observations,
Das Thakur et al. demonstrated that some vemurafenibresistant melanoma cell lines expressing BRAF alternative
splicing variants or amplified BRAF may become drug
dependent for their proliferation, and that cessation of
vemurafenib exposure may lead to regression of these
tumors. A discontinuous dosing strategy using either a
4 weeks on/2 weeks off or an individualized regimen,
exploiting the fitness disadvantage displayed by drugresistant cells in the absence of the drug, delayed the
onset of drug-resistant disease in two primary human
xenograft models. Even if the pause from BRAF inhibition
allowed sensitive tumours to re-grow, these cells remained
responsive to vemurafenib re-administration. Repeated
cycles of vemurafenib treatment using these regimens
controlled tumor growth over the course of 7 months of
treatment, whereas mice treated on a continuous cycle
developed resistance as soon as 2 months after initiation
of therapy [73-75]. Other studies seem to support these
findings: cells expressing distinct mutant BRAF splice
variants grew more efficiently in vitro and in vivo in the
presence rather than in the absence of the vemurafenib
analog PLX4720 and, after a drug free interval, became
re-sensitized to BRAF inhibition; a drug holiday was
also shown to be effective in a melanoma cell line in
which resistance was mediated by BRAF copy number
amplification [77] and acquired EGFR expression [36].
These findings further provide a rationale to investigate an
intermittent regimen with BRAFi: a Phase II clinical study
is underway evaluating intermittent dosing of a BRAFi
(LGX818) in patients with BRAF-mutated metastatic
melanoma (NCT01894672). LGX818 will be administered
on a daily schedule dosing for the first 6 weeks; this will
be followed by a 2 week break and, thereafter, patients will
resume LGX818 on a 2 weeks on/2 weeks off schedule
(Table 2).
To what degree these observations made in
preclinical models translate into patients is an open
issue. In fact, as already mentioned, continued treatment
beyond progression with BRAFi seems to be associated
with increased survival and no tumor regressions have
been reported after treatment discontinuation, suggesting
that many and more complicated factors are involved in
determining the response of resistant cells to BRAFi in the
clinical setting. Nevertheless, anecdotal clinical evidence
already exist for the successful application of intermittent
dosing or re-challenge of BRAF/MEK inhibitors in
melanoma patients. Two patients were successfully
rechallenged after progression with vemurafenib or
dabrafeib+trametinib [78], and a melanoma patient in
which vemurafenib induced proliferation of a previously
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

undetected NRAS-mutant chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia was successfully treated using an adjusted
intermittent schedule of vemurafenib guided by changes
in white cell counts [79].
In clinical practice, until further investigations and
availability of new drugs, patients who progress rapidly
and in multiple sites during treatment are unlikely to
benefit from continuation of MAPK inhibitors and
should switch to another line of therapy, while patients
with isolated progression, suitable for local treatment,
may benefit from continuation of BRAFi treatment,
as resistance mechanisms are not always shared by all
metastasis [65]. Local treatments may also have a role in
case of partial responses with low and accessible tumor
burden, when residual lesions, which are a potential
evolutionary reservoir of resistant tumor cells, may be
removed radically.

Combinations with immunotherapy
Even if a multi-targeted treatment approach and
individualized regimens may improve response rate and
their duration, tumor heterogeneity remains a barrier to
obtain complete and long-term responses; a combination
strategy including the use of an immunotherapeutic agent
may provide more durable responses and long-term
survival.
There is strong rationale for combined BRAFtargeted therapy and immunotherapy for melanoma.
Most studies have supported the idea that BRAFi are
unlikely to impair the immune system [80] [81]; on the
contrary, these agents may have immunomodulatory
properties and enhance immune activation, as treatment
with MAPK inhibitors is associated with enhanced
expression of melanocytic antigens, antigen recognition
by T cells and an influx of cytotoxic T lymphocytes [82]
[83-86]. BRAFi paradoxically activate ERK in wild-type
cells and this effect was also observed in T cells: BRAFi
enhance T cell activation in a concentration-dependent
fashion [87]. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that
oncogenic BRAF is immunosuppressive [88], further
supporting the rationale for the development of combined
targeted therapies with immunotherapy. The first attempt
combining BRAFi vemurafenib with anti-CTLA-4
antibody ipilimumab failed due to toxicity issues [89].
Nevetheless, new immunotherapeutic drugs are about to
be approved, such as anti-PD-1 antibodies nivolumab and
pembrolizumab, which seem to be more tolerated than
ipilimumab and, at the same time, to have higher response
rates. Increased PD-L1 expression by cancer cells is an
escape mechanism from host immunity and reactivation of
MAPK seems to be associated with increased expression
of PD-L1 [90,91]. Anti-PD-1 agents block the ligation
of PD-L1, expressed on cancer and antigen-presenting
cells, to PD-1, expressed on T cells, preventing it to
suppress T-cell activation and proliferation and to induce
10216

Oncotarget

T-cell apoptosis. Moreover, tumor expression of PD-L1
is a biomarker of clinical activity of anti-PD-1 agents,
further supporting a combination with such drugs.
Clinical studies are underway to assess the feasibility
and clinical activity of combination therapy with BRAFi,
not only with anti-PD-1 and anti-PDL-1 agents, but also
with interleukin, adoptive cell therapy and interferon
(Table 2). As a matter of fact, the combination of targeted
therapy with BRAF inhibitors and interferon has a strong
rationale [92]. Interferon receptor subunit IFNAR1 is
down-regulated in BRAF-mutated melanoma cells, while
BRAF inhibition up-regulates its expression; moreover,
vemurafenib and IFNα-2b combination enhances HLA
class I antigen expression, which is associated with an
increased recognition of melanoma cells by cognate T
cells. The combination of vemurafenib and interferon
significantly prolonged survival in mice grafted with
BRAF-mutated melanoma cells, and two phase I-II studies
are evaluating in humans the safety and activity of the
combination of vemurafenib plus low-dose peg-interferon
(NCT01959633) or high-dose interferon (NCT01943422).
Pre-clinical and clinical evidence suggest that
immunotherapy should be incorporated early in the course
of MAPK inhibitor treatment, in combination or within an
intermittent regimen. In fact, laboratory data demonstrate
immune cell infiltration into tumors soon after treatment
commencement [82,85] and clinical data available on
ipilimumab show that immunotherapy has limited efficacy
in almost half patients failing BRAFi treatment [93,94].

obtain long-term survival in patients with BRAF-mutated
metastatic melanoma, although toxicity issues may arise
and should be carefully evaluated in clinical trials.

The successful development of BRAFi is an
example of translation of molecular biology for cancer
personalized treatment. However, the benefit provided
by BRAFi is limited by resistance and several challenges
must be addressed to develop more effective therapeutic
strategies. Multiple treatment modalities, including other
targeted therapies and immunotherapy, are now available
for testing and combination. The understanding of the
molecular basis of BRAFi drug resistance may provide
insights useful to design the best strategies to prevent or
delay the emergence of resistant clones; paradoxically,
drug resistance may even be exploited to selectively kill
resistant cells [95].
Growing evidence of intra-patient heterogeneity
of resistance, cross-resistance and alternative pathways
activation highlight the need to perform dedicated
molecular analysis of resistance and support the rationale
that stronger and longer anti-tumor activity will be
obtained when multiple pathways are targeted, either in
combination or as part of an intermittent dosing regimen.
Moreover, combinatorial and sequential approaches
which merge the high response rate and rapidity of tumor
regression of BRAFi–based treatments with the long-term
responses of immunotherapy may be effective strategies to
