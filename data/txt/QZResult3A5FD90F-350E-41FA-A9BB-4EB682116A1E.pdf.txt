Abstract
Bcl-2 is an antiapoptotic protein that has also been found to function as a proangiogenic signaling molecule.
Improvements in antiangiogenic therapy can be engendered by metronomic dosing. Thus, we hypothesized that
BH3-mimetic drugs that antagonize Bcl-2 family proteins may exert a greater efﬁcacy when dosed metronomically. To examine this hypothesis, we employed AT101, an orally available and well-tolerated BH3-mimetic drug
that has been established as effective. In a mouse xenograft model of human squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) that
includes a humanized vasculature, we explored the effects of docetaxel in combination with either daily
(metronomic) or weekly (bolus) doses of AT101. In addition, we explored the effect of single or combination
therapy on angiogenesis and survival of endothelial or SCC cells in vitro. Metronomic AT101 therapy increased
mouse survival, decreased tumor mitotic index, and decreased tumor microvessel density, compared with bolus
therapy. Therapeutic potentiation was achieved by similar overall drug exposure and without altering systemic
toxicities. Combinations of AT101 and docetaxel produced additive toxicity in both endothelial and SCC tumor
cells. Notably, subapoptotic concentrations of AT101 potently inhibited the angiogenic potential of endothelial
cells. Taken together, our ﬁndings unveil the efﬁcacious beneﬁts that can be achieved by metronomic delivery of
BH3-mimetic drugs, in particular suggesting that SCC patients with might beneﬁt from low-dose continuous
administration of these drugs. Cancer Res; 72(3); 716–25. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Induction chemotherapy with taxanes, platinum-based
compounds, and 5-ﬂuorouracil is beneﬁcial for head and neck
cancer patients (1, 2), but the prolonged use of chemotherapeutic drugs is limited by their toxicity and by the development
of resistance. The combined use of molecularly targeted agents
with conventional therapies has been proposed more recently
for management of patients with locally advanced head and
neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC; ref. 3). These types of
combination therapies have shown promising results, but the
survival of head and neck cancer patients has not changed
dramatically (4). Improvements in the survival of these
patients require mechanism-based therapeutic strategies that

maximize the antitumor effect of drugs while limiting their
toxicities.
Metronomic chemotherapy has been proposed as a mean to
potentiate the antitumor effect of chemotherapeutic drugs and
to overcome drug resistance (5–7). Several independent groups
have shown beneﬁts of the metronomic regimen in preclinical
and clinical studies (8–10). Although much has been learned
about the use of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs in
metronomic regimen over the last 10 years, little is known
about this type of regimen with molecularly targeted drugs.
A signiﬁcant proportion of head and neck tumors express
high levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (11, 12). Indeed, high
Bcl-2 expression correlates directly with resistance to therapy
with cisplatin (13), and is associated with poor clinical outcomes for head and neck cancer patients (14, 15). We have
shown that Bcl-2 gene expression is signiﬁcantly higher
(approximately 60,000-fold) in the tumor-associated endothelial cells of patients with HNSCC, as compared with endothelial
cells from the normal oral mucosa (16). Collectively, these
studies provide strong rationale for the investigation of the
antitumor and antiangiogenic effects of drugs targeted to the
Bcl-2 pathway.
BH3-mimetic compounds derived from (-)-gossypol, a natural product from cotton plant (17), inhibit the survival function of Bcl-2 family members by stimulating Noxa and Puma
(18). These compounds have shown antitumor effect as a single
agent or in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy in
various tumor models (19–21), and seem to help to overcome
resistance to therapy (22–24). We have shown the potent

antiangiogenic effect (25) and antitumor effect of a small
molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2 in head and neck cancer models
(26). However, we do not understand the impact of the regimen
of administration of a BH3-mimetic drug (AT101) on tumor
growth and angiogenesis. Here, we observed that a metronomic regimen (i.e., daily administration of low-dose AT101) has
more potent antitumor and antiangiogenic effects than weekly
administration without compromising the low systemic toxicity proﬁle of the drug.

Material and Methods
Cells and reagents
Primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells
(HDMEC; Lonza) were cultured in endothelial cell growth
medium (EGM2-MV; Lonza). HNSCC cell lines UM-SCC-17B
and UM-SCC-74A (gift from T. Carey, University of Michigan)
were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10%
FBS, 200 mmol/L L-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin at
37 C with 5% CO2. The identity of all tumor cell lines was
conﬁrmed by genotyping at the University of Michigan DNA
sequencing core facility in May 2010. For in vitro studies, the
small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2 (AT101; ref. 27) and taxotere
(TXT; LC laboratories) were dissolved in DMSO. For in vivo
studies, AT101 was resuspended in carboxymethyl cellulose
and sonicated for 30 minutes, whereas TXT was dissolved in 5%
ethanol.
SRB assay
Sulforhodamine B (SRB) cytotoxicity assays were done as
described (25). Brieﬂy, cells were seeded at 2  103 cells per well
of 96-well plates, allowed to attach overnight, and treated with
AT101 and/or taxotere for 72 to 96 hours. Cells were ﬁxed with
10% trichloroacetic acid, stained with 0.4% SRB (SigmaAldrich) in 1% acetic acid, and plates were read in a microplate
reader at 560 nm (GENios; Tecan). Test results were normalized against initial plating density and drug-free controls. Data
were obtained from triplicate wells per condition and is
representative of 3 independent experiments.
Droplet assay
Droplets were formed by mixing HDMEC and 10% sucrose
containing 0.05% puramatrix (BD Biosciences). Droplet was
transferred to type I collagen (Angiotech BioMaterials) coated
plates and covered with collagen containing 50 ng/mL
rhVEGF165 (R&D Systems). Treatment started as soon as
sprout outgrowth was visible. Drug containing medium was
changed every day in the metronomic group whereas in the
bolus treatment group the complete dose was delivered in the
ﬁrst day. Data were obtained from triplicate wells per condition and is representative of 3 independent experiments.

mice (Charles River Laboratory) were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine, and scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsal region of each mouse. When tumor size
reached 200 mm3, mice were randomized into 4 groups (n ¼ 8):
vehicle, taxotere, weekly AT101þtaxotere (bolus), and daily
AT101þtaxotere (metronomic). At termination of the experiment, mice were euthanized, tumors were retrieved, ﬁxed
overnight in 10% buffered formalin at 4 C, and processed for
histology. The histopathology was assessed by a trained pathologist unaware of treatment conditions. The mitotic index (29)
was determined by counting mitotic ﬁgures in 5 high-power
ﬁelds per tumor section. Mice were euthanized whenever the
tumor volume reached 2,000 mm3 following the University of
Michigan Guidelines for Use and Care of Animals. Tumor size
was calculated using the formula: volume (mm3) ¼ L  W2/2 (L,
length; W, width).
Immunohistochemistry
Parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections were incubated in antigen retrieval solution (Dako) for 20 minutes at 90 C to 95 C.
Tissues were exposed to 1:500 dilution of the anti-human factor
VIII antibody (NeoMarkers) overnight at 4 C, as described (28).
Blood vessels were counted in 6 random ﬁelds per tumor, from
8 tumors per group.
Statistical analysis
Time-to-failure data was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier
method and the log-rank test. Where multiple ﬁelds were
measured, the average was taken for each mouse. Continuous
measurements, such as tumor volume, average mitosis per
mm2 and average microvessel density were analyzed using
nonparametric rank-based Wilcoxon tests and Kruskal–Wallis
tests. The growth curve of tumor volume (mm3) was transformed by log2 to improve linearity assumptions of residuals
for longitudinal modeling. We refer to this transformation as
log2 tumor volume and can be interpreted as tumor doubling. A
longitudinal mixed model was used to test the difference in
growth patterns based on treatment group. Kaplan–Meier
analysis, longitudinal analysis, and Wilcoxon tests were carried
out using SAS v9.2 software. In vitro statistical analysis was
carried out using ANOVA followed by Tukey's test (SigmaStat
2.0 software; SPSS). The synergism or additivity was calculated
using the combinatorial index (CI), a mathematical and quantitative evaluation of a 2-drug pharmacologic interaction (30).
Using CalcuSyn ver. 2.0 software (Biosoft), CI values were
generated over a range of fractional cell kill levels (Fa) from
0.05 to 0.95 (5%–95% cell kill). Accordingly, a synergistic effect
is represented by CI < 0.9; an additive effect by 0.9  CI  1.1;
and absence of combinatorial effect CI > 1.1. Statistical significance was deﬁned as P  0.05, unless otherwise speciﬁed.

xenografts with humanized vasculature (31, 32). All experimental conditions included low-dose taxotere (5 mg/kg taxotere,
once a week) to mimic the most probable clinical scenario for
the use of the targeted drug in combination with a conventional chemotherapeutic drug. The maximum-tolerated dose
(MTD) for BH3-mimetic was estimated to be around 40 mg/kg
for 3 days (20) and for taxotere around 50 mg/kg weekly (33).
In pilot experiments, we observed that oral administration of
105 mg/kg AT101 plus 5 mg/kg taxotere weekly caused 15% to
20% weight loss, and was considered to be the MTD for the
combination therapies (data not shown). These studies also
showed that weekly 70 mg/kg AT101 plus 5 mg/kg taxotere was
well tolerated by mice (<15% weight loss).

The criterion to determine failure for the Kaplan–Meier
analysis was a 5-fold increase in tumor volume as compared
with baseline (i.e., immediately prior to start of treatment).
These experiments were carried out with an aggressive
squamous cell carcinoma (UM-SCC-17B), and therefore the
time-to-failure was as low as 28 days (vehicle control) after
transplantation of 100,000 tumor cells/mouse. The average
time-to-failure was 30.6 days (vehicle), 33.3 days (taxotere),
37.3 days (weekly AT101þtaxotere), and 48.5 days (daily
AT101þtaxotere). The distribution of time-to-failure was
signiﬁcantly different across the 4 experimental groups
(P < 0.0001; Fig. 1A). Daily AT101þtaxotere mediated a
signiﬁcant delay in time-to-failure as compared with all

randomized into the different treatment regimens, that is, vehicle, taxotere, weekly AT101þtaxotere, or daily AT101þtaxotere (n ¼ 8). Daily administration of
low-dose AT101 (10 mg/kg) was designated as "metronomic" regimen, whereas weekly administration of high-dose AT101 (70 mg/kg) was designated as
"bolus" regimen. In both cases, AT101 was delivered via oral gavage and treatment was carried out for 3 weeks. In all conditions, 5 mg/kg TXT was
administered weekly via intraperitoneal injection. A, Kaplan–Meier analysis using as criterion for failure a 5-fold increase in tumor volume as compared

statistical signiﬁcance (P ¼ 0.0660). However, starting at day 31
of treatment and continuing thereafter, the tumor volume in
mice that received daily AT101þtaxotere was consistently
lower (P  0.050) than the tumor volume in mice treated with
weekly AT101þtaxotere (Fig. 1B). Notably, we did not observe
deaths attributed to drug toxicity with the regimens used here,
and the average weight loss was consistently less than 15%
(Fig. 1D). Moreover, no signs of toxicity were observed in vital
organs including liver and lung (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Tumors treated with metronomic AT101 combined with
taxotere were less aggressive and less vascularized
In general, xenografts showed tumor cells with basophile
cytoplasm, increased nuclear-to-cytoplasm diameter ratio,
and marked cellular pleomorphism (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the
metronomic AT101þtaxotere group presented a distinct
pattern, with a large proportion of clear cells (Fig. 2A). The
tumor cells presented clear cytoplasm and smaller nucleus
with higher condensation of chromatin. In addition, larger
necrotic areas were observed (Fig. 2A). We observed
a signiﬁcant overall difference in mitotic index (Fig. 2B,
P < 0.0001) and tumor microvessel density (Fig. 2C,
P ¼ 0.0003). Pairwise analysis revealed that the mitotic
index of daily AT101þtaxotere was lower than the mitotic
index of each one of the other experimental conditions, as
follows (P ¼ 0.0047, compared with vehicle; P ¼ 0.0044,
compared with taxotere; and P ¼ 0.0046, compared with
weekly AT101þtaxotere; Fig. 2B). We also observed that the
microvessel density in the daily AT101þtaxotere group was
lower than in the vehicle control (P ¼ 0.0047), taxotere only
(P ¼ 0.0046), and weekly AT101þtaxotere (P ¼ 0.0046; Fig.
2C). Moreover, qualitative assessment revealed that the daily
AT101þtaxotere regimen induced more tumor cell apoptosis, as compared with the other experimental conditions
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

In vitro analyses of the cytotoxic effects of AT101 and
taxotere
The IC50 for AT101 was 0.80 mmol/L (HDMEC) and ranged
from 2.13 to 2.54 mmol/L for head neck tumor cells (UMSCC-17B, UM-SCC-74A; Fig. 3). The IC50 for taxotere was 0.37
nmol/L (HDMEC), and ranged form 0.21 to 0.53 nmol/L for
the tumor cells evaluated (Fig. 3). The IC25 and IC75 of these 2
drugs were also calculated in a separate set of experiments
with narrower range of drug concentrations (data not
shown).
To investigate whether AT101 sensitizes HDMEC and
tumor cells to chemotherapy, we examined the cytotoxic
effects of the IC25, IC50, IC75 concentrations for each drug by
itself or in combination. Additive effects were observed
primarily when higher concentrations of AT101 were combined with taxotere for all cell types examined here (Fig. 4).
Interestingly, the overall trends for the CI analysis were
similar for endothelial cells and head and neck tumor cells
(Fig. 4).
Next, we investigated the effect of treatment sequence on
the cytotoxicity of these drugs in HDMEC and tumor cells.
For each cell type, we either pretreated cells with one drug
for 24 hours, or started treatment together with the 2 drugs.
The drug concentration was set at the IC50, and 2 time
periods were evaluated to factor-in the overall time of
treatment on the effects observed. We observed that starting
the 2 drugs at the same time provided the highest cytotoxic
effect for all cell types evaluated here (P < 0.01; Fig. 5).
Propidium iodide staining followed by ﬂow cytometry was
carried out to observe the effects of different treatment
sequence on apoptosis and cell cycle of UM-SCC-74A. The
use of both drugs at the same time induced more apoptosis
than any other experimental condition tested here (P < 0.05;
Supplementary Fig. S3A). Cell-cycle analysis showed that
drug sequence had no detectable effect on the proportion of
UM-SCC-74A cells in S-phase (Supplementary Fig. S3B and
S3C).

Metronomic Therapy with a Targeted Drug

Figure 4. Effect of AT101 and taxotere drug combination on endothelial cells and head and neck tumor cells. The cytotoxicity was determined by the SRB
assay. A–C, cells were exposed to AT101 or TXT for 72 hours. The concentrations selected for this study were the IC25, IC50, and IC75 for each drug in each cell
line. CI was calculated for each experimental condition. A plus sign (þ) depicts additive effect (0.9  CI  1.1). Data were normalized against vehicle control and

Effect of AT101 regimen on the angiogenic potential of
endothelial cells in 3-D matrices
AT101 [(-) gossypol] has been developed and characterized
as a functional inhibitor of Bcl-2 via binding to BH3-binding
domain and interference with the interaction of Bcl-2 with
other BH3-containing proapoptotic proteins (34, 35). As
expected, Bcl-2 expression was not affected by AT101 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4), conﬁrming previous observations (23). To evaluate the antiangiogenic effect of AT101 in
vitro, we created three dimensional (3-D) droplets of endothelial cells and plated them in collagen matrices. Endothelial cells
were induced to sprout with VEGF, and 0.1  IC50 (0.08 mmol/
L), IC50 (0.8 mmol/L), 10  IC50 (8 mmol/L) AT101 were used. We
either administered these dosages at once (bolus), or mimicked
the metronomic regimen by dividing them in 4 daily administrations. The highest concentration of AT101 eliminated
capillary sprouts by 4 days in both regimens (Fig. 6). For both
0.1  IC50 and IC50 conditions, the daily administration of the

www.aacrjournals.org

drug led to more potent reduction in capillary sprouting than
the administration of the same overall dosage at once (0.08
mmol/L daily vs. 0.08 mmol/L bolus; P < 0.001, 0.8 mmol/L daily
vs. 0.8 mmol/L bolus; P ¼ 0.023; Fig. 6B). Interestingly, the
lowest concentration of AT101 used here (0.08 mmol/L AT101)
induced a potent antiangiogenic effect (P < 0.001), despite the
fact that this concentration is subapoptotic (Fig. 6B). These
data corroborated our previous reports that Bcl-2 functions as
a proangiogenic signaling molecule (36), in addition to its wellknown effects on the regulation of endothelial cell survival (28).

Discussion
Improvements in the survival of head and neck cancer
patients will most likely come from the development and
characterization of mechanism-based therapies that combine
the potency of cytotoxic drugs with the speciﬁcity of molecularly targeted agents. Evidence clearly shows the role of Bcl-2

cytotoxicity was determined by the SRB assay. Cells were pretreated either with AT101 or with TXT for 24 hours. Then, cells were exposed to AT101 or TXT for
additional 48 or 72 hours. Alternatively, treatment was done with both drugs administered at the same time, or carried out with single drug as controls. Asterisk

in the poor outcomes of patients with head and neck cancer
(37). We have also shown that Bcl-2 plays a dominant role in
head and neck tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth
(16, 25, 31, 38). Therefore, targeting the Bcl-2 system is appealing because it has 2 complimentary effects mediated by the
direct induction of tumor cell apoptosis and the selective
disruption of tumor blood vessels (35).
The combination of the BH3-mimetic drug AT101 with
taxotere, a microtube-binding drug, was selected for these
experiments. Although taxotere is widely used in many
tumor types including head and neck cancer, strong side
effects such as myelosuppression have suggested that combination therapies that allow for a reduction of its dosage are
highly desirable (1, 39, 40). Likewise, although single-drug
therapy with BH3 mimetics partially inhibits tumor growth
in some cancer models (41, 42), combination therapies tend
to enhance the efﬁcacy of the BH3 mimetics (43, 44).
Notably, it has been recently reported that the combination
of BH3 mimetic with taxotere inhibits tumor cell growth and
affects expression of several genes involved in drug resistance, drug metabolism, DNA repair, cell cycle and oncogenes in a prostate tumor cell line (PC3; ref. 22). Here, we
observed that the combination of AT101 with taxotere
augments the antitumor cell and antiangiogenic effects of
each one of these drugs used individually. Notably, best
results were achieved with higher doses of AT101, a drug
with minimal systemic cytotoxicities, combined with lower
doses of taxotere. Collectively, these data unveil a drug
combination that is highly effective in vivo while showing
modest systemic cytotoxic effects.
Metronomic therapy of DNA-damaging agents or microtubule inhibitors has shown more efﬁciency than MTD therapy in
randomized phase III clinical trials (45, 46). Metronomic
therapy of certain drugs induces sustained suppression of
circulating endothelial progenitor cells, whereas MTD schedules seem to allow for rebound vessel repair responses

722

mediated primarily by bone marrow cell recruitment (43).
Here, we examined the approach of using the metronomic
regimen for the molecularly targeted drug in combination with
conventional regimen for chemotherapy drug. Remarkably,
combination of metronomic AT101 with taxotere showed
potent inhibition of tumor growth, and prolongation of the
survival of mice with established tumors (as compared with
bolus treatment of AT101 and taxotere) despite the fact that
the total amount of drug administered in both conditions was
exactly the same. We believe that this difference in response
was mediated by the potentiation of both the antiangiogenic
and the tumor cell effect of AT101 when used in a metronomic
regimen.
It is well known that vessel rebound rapidly occurs during
the breaks in treatment (47). We postulate that by keeping
constant the antiangiogenic pressure, achieved even when
very low concentrations of BH3-mimetic are used (25, 36),
one does not allow for the vascular rebound and therefore
the overall antitumor growth effect is potentiated. This
hypothesis is currently under investigation in our laboratory.
In addition, based on our results we speculate that low-dose
BH3-mimetic prevents the development of resistance of
tumor cells to therapy, by interfering with the prosurvival
effect of Bcl-2 family proteins. A closer look at the histopathology of tumors treated with metronomic AT101 combined with taxotere supports this hypothesis. We observed
that this treatment regimen results in lower mitotic index as
compared with all other treatment groups of this study.
Notably, recent studies showed that the mitotic index is a
potent indicator of patient survival with melanoma or breast
carcinoma (48, 49). Moreover, in the metronomic AT101
group the tumor cells displayed a clear cytoplasm, suggesting glycogen accumulation compatible with chronic hypoxia
and glucose deprivation. This might be related to the fact
that this treatment regimen resulted in lower microvessel
density.

Metronomic Therapy with a Targeted Drug

Figure 6. Effect of metronomic versus bolus AT101 on the angiogenic potential of human endothelial cells. The effect of AT101 on the angiogenic potential was
evaluated in primary HDMEC plated in 3-D collagen matrices. A, graph depicting the number of capillary sprouts in VEGF-treated HDMEC exposed to AT101
for 4 days. AT101 was used at the following concentrations: 0.1  IC50 (0.08 mmol/L), IC50 (0.8 mmol/L), 10  IC50 (8 mmol/L). In the metronomic group, 1/4 of the
IC50 was administered daily (from day 0 to 3); whereas in the bolus treatment group, the full dose was administered on day 0. The total amount of drug was the
same in the metronomic and bolus treatment group. B, graph depicting the number of sprouts at the end of the experimental period. Different letters depict
statistically signiﬁcant differences at P < 0.050. C, representative photomicrographs of capillary sprouts (150) at the end of the experimental period. Results
were normalized against initial number of sprouts. Experiments were done in triplicate wells per condition. Data are the representative of 3 independent
experiments.

In summary, we showed that metronomic administration
of the BH3-mimetic drug AT101 in combination with low-dose
taxotere improves the survival of mice-bearing HNSCC xenografts. These results were correlated with lower mitotic index
and tumor microvessel density. Notably, we observed that

subapoptotic concentrations of AT101 potently inhibited the
angiogenic potential of endothelial cells. The fact that AT101
can be administered orally raises the possibility that patients
could take low does of this drug in both therapeutic and
chemopreventive regimen. Collectively, this work unveils the
