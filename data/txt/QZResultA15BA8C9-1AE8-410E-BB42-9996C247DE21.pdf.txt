Abstract
Inhibition of tumor angiogenesis through blockade of the
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway
is a novel treatment modality in oncology. Preclinical findings
suggest that long-term clinical outcomes may improve with
blockade of additional proangiogenic receptor tyrosine
kinases: platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR)
and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR). BIBF 1120 is an
indolinone derivative potently blocking VEGF receptor
(VEGFR), PDGFR and FGFR kinase activity in enzymatic
assays (IC50, 20–100 nmol/L). BIBF 1120 inhibits mitogenactivated protein kinase and Akt signaling pathways in three
cell types contributing to angiogenesis, endothelial cells,
pericytes, and smooth muscle cells, resulting in inhibition of
cell proliferation (EC50, 10–80 nmol/L) and apoptosis. In all
tumor models tested thus far, including human tumor
xenografts growing in nude mice and a syngeneic rat tumor
model, BIBF 1120 is highly active at well-tolerated doses (25–
100 mg/kg daily p.o.), as measured by magnetic resonance
imaging of tumor perfusion after 3 days, reducing vessel
density and vessel integrity after 5 days, and inducing
profound growth inhibition. A distinct pharmacodynamic
feature of BIBF 1120 in cell culture is sustained pathway
inhibition (up to 32 hours after 1-hour treatment), suggesting
slow receptor off-kinetics. Although BIBF 1120 is rapidly
metabolized in vivo by methylester cleavage, resulting in a
short mean residence time, once daily oral dosing is fully
efficacious in xenograft models. These distinctive pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties may help explain
clinical observations with BIBF 1120, currently entering phase
III clinical development. [Cancer Res 2008;68(12):4774–82]

Introduction
Targeted drugs interfering with the formation and maintenance
of tumor blood vessels provide clinical benefit to cancer patients,
including tumor regressions and prolonged survival, with acceptable tolerability (1, 2). Monoclonal antibodies to vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), notably bevacizumab (3), as
well as small molecule inhibitors targeting the VEGF receptor
(VEGFR) kinases, such as sunitinib and sorafenib (4), have been

introduced into clinical practice and continue to be profiled in
additional indications, alone or in combination with other
treatment modalities. A next wave of antiangiogenic drug
candidates is in clinical development, aiming to broaden the
spectrum of cancer types or the proportion of patients that benefit
from this new treatment modality (5–7).
From a mechanistic viewpoint, the concept of tumor angiogenesis has been refined since its early inception in the 1970s (8). The
physiology of blood vessel formation and remodeling has been
carefully dissected, showing that new capillaries form via a
complex, tightly regulated process involving not only endothelial
cells but also perivascular cells, such as pericytes and smooth
muscle cells (9). The individual steps of angiogenesis, such as
recruitment of endothelial precursor cells, endothelial cell proliferation, migration and survival, capillary tube formation, and
pruning of capillary beds, were mapped and found to differ among
normal and diseased tissues, with cancer vasculature being
particularly aberrant in its composition and architecture (10).
Whereas the pivotal role of VEGF and VEGFR-2 in stimulating
normal and disease-associated angiogenesis has been amply
documented (11–17), it has become apparent that additional
mechanisms may enhance or modulate this process, a consideration of potential importance in light of clinical experience with
antiangiogenic drugs. Conceptually, the process of angiogenesis is
of equal importance in all solid cancers, and yet there is wide
variability in the extent to which current antiangiogenic drugs
benefit individual patients. Relevant clinical factors include the
organ type and stage of a given cancer, but most of the variability in
tumor responsiveness is still unaccounted for. As clinical benefit
seems to be transient in the majority of patients who initially
respond to therapy (18, 19), several escape mechanisms have been
considered. One particular line of evidence, based on preclinical
animal models, suggests that targeting VEGF-VEGFR signaling and
focusing on endothelial cells is beneficial at the start of treatment,
but with continued drug treatment and under the pressure of
VEGF signaling blockade resulting in increased hypoxia and
malnutrition on the tumor cells, other signaling molecules and
their cognate receptors provide alternate mechanisms to drive
disease progression. Among the potential compensatory mechanisms, the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast
growth factor (FGF) pathways—involving the PDGF receptors
(PDGFR) important for signaling in perivascular smooth muscle
cells and pericytes and FGF receptors (FGFR) that have been
described as a potential escape mechanism with tumor cells
switching from VEGF to FGF signaling to attract endothelial cells
(20)—have been identified as promising targets for optimized drug
candidates. In fact, the structural similarities between VEGFR,
PDGFR, and FGFR tyrosine kinases provide a window for medicinal
chemistry to design inhibitors that are active on all three kinase

families, yet retain the overall kinase selectivity profile indispensable for a safe and well-tolerated drug candidate (21).
In this report, we describe the preclinical profile of BIBF 1120, a
combined VEGFR, FGFR, and PDGFR inhibitor currently entering
phase III clinical studies in non–small cell lung carcinoma and
other cancers. We present an analysis of BIBF 1120 in functional
tests with three cell types known to contribute to tumor
angiogenesis. For endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle
cells, we provide in vitro biochemical analysis of signaling pathway
modulation and assess effects on cell proliferation and survival. We
further show that BIBF 1120, building on this pharmacologic
profile, as well as distinct pharmacokinetic properties, is effective
and well tolerated in multiple animal models of cancer.

Materials and Methods
Chemistry. The indolinone BIBF 1120 was derived from a chemical lead
optimization program designed for receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(Patent Application WO01/27081, example 473).
Protein expression and X-ray crystallography. VEGFR-2 lacking the
central kinase insert domain (T940-E989, E990V), as described in ref. 22, was
cloned into a baculovirus vector. The construct contained, in addition, an
NH2 terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag and a thrombin cleavage
site. GST-VEGFR-2 was expressed in High-5 cells. Cell pellets were lysed by
dounce homogenization in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 20 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L
DTT, supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche; pH 8.0). The
lysate was centrifuged for 45 min at 19,000  g. GST-VEGFR-2 in the soluble
fraction was bound to reduced glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (GE
Healthcare), and the GST tag cleaved (on-column) with thrombin overnight.
VEGFR-2 in the supernatant was phosphorylated in vitro by addition of
MgCl2 and ATP to 26 and 4 mmol/L, respectively. After concentration over
Centricon-10 centrifugal concentrators (Millipore), VEGFR-2 was applied to
a Superdex 75 HiLoad 16/60 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare)
equilibrated with 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 20 mmol/L NaCl, and 5 mmol/L DTT
(pH 8.0). VEGFR-2 containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to
8 mg/mL. Final material was aliquoted, frozen, and stored at 80jC. The
protein was incubated with 1 mmol/L BIBF 1120 for 30 min at 4jC and was
crystallized as previously described (22). The crystals appeared in 7 d and
belonged to space group P212121 with cell dimensions of a = 38.25, b = 94.44,
and c = 96.22. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and
refined at a resolution of 2.1 Å to a final R factor of 21.7% (R free = 27.9%)
using the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4.
The CCP4 Suite: Programs for Protein Crystallography. Acta Cryst., 1994;
D50: 760–3) and COOT (23), respectively. The atomic coordinates of the
structure and the structure factors have been deposited in the protein
databank with the accession code 3C7Q.
In vitro kinase activity assays. The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain
of VEGFR-2 (residues 797–1355 according to sequence deposited in
databank SWISS-PROT P35968) was cloned into pFastBac fused to GST
and extracted as described in supplementary methods. Enzyme activity was
assayed using standard conditions using a random polymer (Glu/Tyr 4:1;
Sigma) and in the presence of 100 Amol/L ATP ( for details, see
supplementary methods). For all other kinase assays, the entire cytoplasmic
domains of the receptors ( from the end of the transmembrane to the COOH
terminus) were cloned into pFastBac vector containing GST and assayed
under standard conditions.
Human cancer cell lines and normal endothelial cells, pericytes,
and smooth muscle cell cultures. Tumor cell lines FaDu (American Type
Culture Collection, ATCC; HTB-43), Caki-1 (ATCC, HTB-46), HT-29 (ATCC,
HTB-38), SKOV-3 (ATCC, HTB-77), H460 (ATCC, HTB-177), Calu-6 (ATCC,
HTB-56), PAC-120 (24), and the rat glioma cell line GS-9L (25) were cultured
in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM; Life Technologies-Bethesda
Research Laboratories #21980-032), supplemented with 10% FCS (Sigma), 50
Amol/L h-mercaptoethanol ( for endothelial cell culture; Fluka #63689), and
100 units/mL penicillin/100 Ag/mL streptomycin (P/S; BioWhittaker).
Human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC; Technoclone), human

www.aacrjournals.org

microvascular skin endothelial cells (HMSEC; Technoclone), human
umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (HUASMC; Technoclone), and bovine
retinal pericytes (BRP; for isolation, see supplementary methods) were
grown in IMDM (Life Technologies-Bethesda Research Laboratories), 10%
FCS (Sigma), 50 Amol/L h-mercaptoethanol (Fluka), and P/S (BioWhittaker). For HUVEC and HMSEC, 15 Ag/mL endothelial cell growth
supplement (ECGS; Collaborative Biomedical Products #4006) and 100
Ag/mL heparin (Sigma H-3393) were added. These adherent cells were
grown in gelatin-coated (Sigma G-1393) cell culture flasks at 37jC and 5%
CO2. For the assay, all cell types were starved overnight in medium without
ECGS and heparin and with reduced FCS. On the day of the assay, the cells
were trypsinized, and 2,500 cells per well were plated in 96-well plates (not
gelatin-coated) in a volume of 200 AL IMDM (10% FCS, h-mercaptoethanol,
P/S). Control cells did not receive additional growth factors, all the other
cells were supplemented with 10 Ag/mL heparin and either 5 ng/mL
VEGF165 [human recombinant vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF;
R&D System #293VE050)] or 5 ng/mL basic FGF (bFGF; R&D Systems #234FS) for the endothelial cells. SMCs and BRPs were stimulated with either
bFGF or PDGF-BB (R&D Systems #220-BB), respectively.
Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays. [3H]Thymidine incorporation
assay for proliferation analysis and apoptosis assay was performed as
previously described (26).
Inhibition of cell signaling cascades in drug-treated cells. HUVEC,
HUASMC, and BRP were cultured as described above. Two hours before the
addition of ligands, BIBF 1120 was added to the cultures. Cell lysates were
generated according to standard protocols (Current protocols in molecular
biology, edited by F.M. Ausubel, R. Brent, R.E. Kingston, D.D. Moore, J.G.
Seidman, J.A. Smith & K. Struhl, 2004, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.). Western
blotting was done using standard SDS-PAGE methods, loading 50 to 75 Ag
of protein per lane, with detection by enhanced chemiluminescence. Total
and phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was
analyzed using monoclonal antibodies M3807 and M8159 from Sigma,
respectively. Total Akt was detected using the polyclonal antibody #9272
and phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) was analyzed with the monoclonal
antibody #4058 both from Cell Signaling. Cleaved caspase-3 was detected
with the Cell Signaling monoclonal antibody #9665, and the polyclonal
h-actin antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling (#4967). KDR (VEGFR2) protein was detected using a specific antibody from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (#sc-315).
In vivo tumor models. All experiments complied with the Declaration
of Helsinki and European Policy Legislations (FELASA and GV-SOLAS) on
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Five-week-old to 6-wk-old athymic
NMRI-nu/nu female mice (21–31 g) were purchased from Harlan
(Germany). After acclimatization, mice were inoculated with 1 to 5  106
(in 100 AL) FaDu, Caki-1, SKOV-3, H460, HT-29, or PAC-120 cells s.c. into the
right flank of the animal. F344 Fischer rats were purchased from Charles
River and after acclimatization were injected with 5  106 (in 100 AL) GS-9L
cells s.c. into the right flank of the animal. For pharmacokinetic analysis,
blood was isolated at indicated time points from the retroorbital plexus of
mice and plasma was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry methodology.
Immunohistochemistry and image analysis. For the analysis of vessel
density and vessel morphology in tumor xenografts, female athymic NMRI
nude mice were grafted s.c. with the human FaDu cells, as described above.
Mean tumor volume at the start of the experiment was f100 mm3. Tumors
were excised after 5 d of administration of the compound and from the
vehicle-treated mice. The tumors were embedded in OCT, snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80jC. Tumor sections were analyzed using
the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) immunoperoxidase procedure as previously described (27). Briefly, 5-Am-thick sections were cut and mounted on
poly-(Lysine)–coated slides. Sections were blocked with 10% serum from the
host of the secondary antibody and incubated with the primary antibodies
at the appropriate dilutions in PBS/2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at
room temperature. Biotinylated secondary antibodies were added at a 1:100
dilution, followed by Vectastin ABC solution 1:100 (Vector Labs). The
binding of the antibodies was visualized with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
solution (0.06% DAB in PBS, 0.003% H2O2). Slides were then dehydrated and

counterstained with Harris’ hematoxylin. Colocalization studies for
endothelial and pericyte markers were performed by double immunofluorescence methods. Detection was performed with Alexa 488 goat anti-rat
and Alexa 594 goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes). Primary antibodies used
included antimouse endothelial marker Meca 32 [rat monoclonal antibody
(mAb), 1:1,000, BD PharMingen], anti-PDGFRh (rabbit mAb 28E1, 1:100
dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). For image analysis, the vessel
density was determined on digital images obtained from 5-Am-thick
stained sections of three control and three treated mice. From each
animal, three representative pictures were obtained with a Zeiss Axiophot
microscope at 10 magnification. Measurements were made using the
Definiens Developer image analysis software (Definiens AG). The vessel
area was determined by measuring the vascular structures that were
reactive with the mouse specific antibody Meca 32 compared with the
tumor parenchyma (tumor cells + tumor stroma, excluding normal tissues).
The area of vessels covered by pericytes was determined on adjacent
sections stained with the PDGFRh antibody and calculated as described
above. The significance between means was determined by the Student’s t
test (P < 0.05).
Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI. All experiments were performed in a
PharmaScan 70/16 MR System (Bruker Biospin) using a standard 38-mm 1H
volume resonator in transmit/receive mode. Tumor perfusion/permeability
was determined by dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI (single slice twodimensional T1 weighed FLASH, flip angle 30j, TE = 2.8 ms, TR = 13.5 ms,
NA = 4, NR = 50) using Gd-DTPA (0.1 mmol/kg, Magnevist, Schering).
Contrast agent was given into the tail vein as a short bolus (100 AL in f2 s)
immediately after the acquisition of the fifth image. Initial image analysis
was done within Paravision Software package (Bruker BioSpin). Toft’s model
analysis (28) was used to assess the transfer constant (K TRANS) as
implemented in Jim 3.0 Image Analysis software package (Xinapse Systems
Ltd.). Predefined arterial input function was extracted from a series of
calibration measurements.

Results
Structure of BIBF 1120 bound to VEGFR-2 kinase. BIBF 1120,
a substituted oxindole derivative, was synthesized in a chemical
lead optimization program designed to identify ATP-competitive
inhibitors of VEGFR-2 and other proangiogenic receptor tyrosine
kinases. The expected binding mode was confirmed by cocrystallization with recombinant VEGFR-2 kinase and X-ray diffraction at

a resolution of 2.1 Å (Fig. 1). BIBF 1120 binds to the ATP-binding
site in the cleft between the NH2 and COOH terminal lobes of the
kinase domain. The indolinone scaffold forms two hydrogen bonds
to the backbone nitrogen of Cys919 and the backbone carbonyl
oxygen of Glu917 in the hinge region. The methyl piperacinyl group
points into the solvent region. However, the 4-nitrogen atom of the
N-methyl piperacinyl moiety forms a bidentate ionic interaction
with the carboxylate oxygens of Glu850 with distances of 3.2 and
3.3Å, respectively. Sequence comparisons with the PDGFR kinase
domain show a glutamate residue at an equivalent position
(PDGFRa, Glu609; PDGFRh, Glu615).
Kinase selectivity profile. Extensive biochemical testing
revealed a distinctive, narrow range of kinases that are inhibited
by BIBF 1120 at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.
The targeted kinases include all three VEGFR subtypes (IC50,
13–34 nmol/L), PDGFRa and PDGFRh (IC50, 59 and 65 nmol/L),
and FGFR types 1, 2, and 3 (IC50, 69, 37, and 108 nmol/L,
respectively; Table 1). Comparable inhibition was seen for the
corresponding human and rodent kinases. In addition, BIBF 1120
inhibits FLT3 (inhibition of acute myelogenous leukemia cell
proliferation has been shown previously; ref. 29), as well as
members of the Src-family (Src, Lyn, and Lck). By contrast, receptor
tyrosine kinases, such as EGFR and HER2, InsR, IGF-IR, or the cell
cycle kinases CDK1, CDK2, and CDK4 (Table 1) were not inhibited
at concentrations below 1,000 nmol/L.
Signaling pathways, proliferation, and survival of endothelial cells. Treatment of VEGF-stimulated endothelial cells derived
from umbilical veins (HUVEC) and skin microvessels (HSMEC)
with BIBF 1120 resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and
apoptosis (EC50, <10 nmol/L; Table 2) and was preceded by
inhibition of MAPK and Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Inhibition
of bFGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation required higher drug
concentrations (EC50, 290 nmol/L), although activation of both
MAPK and Akt was at least partially suppressed at concentrations
down to 100 nmol/L. The apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 was
up-regulated in a concentration-dependent manner in both VEGFstimulated and bFGF-stimulated HUVEC, and the proportion of
apoptotic HUVEC cells as measured by TUNEL stain increased

from 2% in control cells to 28% in the presence of 50 nmol/L BIBF
1120 (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
As a control experiment, we tested the effect of BIBF 1120 on the
proliferation of human epithelial cancer cell lines FaDu, Calu-6, and
HeLa, none of which expresses detectable VEGFR, FGFR, or
PDGFR. None of these cell lines was inhibited at the highest
concentration tested (3,500 nmol/L; Table 2).
Effects on pericytes and smooth muscle cells. Pericytes,
important for vessel maturation and stabilization, are known to

express PDGFRs (30). BIBF 1120 inhibited proliferation of PDGFBB–stimulated BRPs with an EC50 of 79 nmol/L (Table 2), which is
in general agreement with the biochemical kinase inhibition data.
Signaling pathway analysis showed that activation of MAPK after
stimulation with 5% serum plus PDGF-BB could be blocked by
BIBF 1120 at concentrations down to 100 nmol/L. Stimulation of
BRP with 5% serum plus bFGF blocked MAPK phosphorylation,
but not concentration-dependently (Fig. 2B). Activation of Akt was
clearly suppressed by BIBF 1120 after stimulation with PDGF-BB or
bFGF down to a concentration of 100 nmol/L; interestingly, no
increase in cleaved caspase-3 resulted from this pathway inhibition.
In cultures of human vascular smooth muscle cells (HUASMC),
BIBF 1120 inhibited PDGF-BB stimulated proliferation with an
EC50 of 69 nmol/L (Table 2), and MAPK activation was inhibited at
concentrations down to 100 nmol/L. Cell lysates of HUASMC
stimulated with bFGF showed inhibition of MAPK activation above
concentrations of 300 nmol/L. Phosphorylation of Akt was
completely blocked in bFGF or PDGF-BB stimulated HUASMC at
BIBF 1120 concentrations as low as 100 nmol/L. Furthermore, the
apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 was up-regulated in bFGFstimulated HUASMC treated with BIBF 1120 (Fig. 2C).
Sustained VEGFR blockade. To determine the duration of
VEGFR-2 inhibition by BIBF 1120, a pulse-chase experiment with
VEGFR-2 transfected NIH3T3 cells (31) was performed. The cells
were exposed for 1 hour to 50 nmol/L BIBF 1120, washed
thoroughly with PBS, and incubated for 8, 24, or 32 hours in
medium followed by stimulation with VEGF for 10 minutes.
Western blot analysis of the cell lysates after immunoprecipitation
revealed that inhibition of receptor phosphorylation was sustained
for at least 32 hours after removal of BIBF 1120 (Supplementary
Fig. S1B).
Rapid in vivo effects on tumor perfusion and permeability
detected by DCE-MRI. Human FaDu (squamous cell carcinoma of
the head and neck) xenografts growing in nude mice were analyzed
by DCE-MRI using gadolinium contrast agent before and 72 hours
after initiation of daily p.o. treatment with BIBF 1120 at 100 mg/kg.
Tumor perfusion and vascular permeability was readily visible in
the initial MRI scan and clearly reduced after 3 days of treatment
(Fig. 3A); quantitation of the K TRANS value showed a significant
decrease in BIBF 1120–treated tumors compared with both
baseline values and untreated controls (Fig. 3A).
BIBF 1120 affects tumor vessel density and pericytes. To
confirm that BIBF 1120 affects the tumor vasculature, mice with
established FaDu xenografts were treated for five consecutive days
with either the vehicle control or BIBF 1120 at a dose of 100 mg/
kg. After the last application, tumors were dissected and analyzed
by immunohistochemistry using Meca 32 and PDGFRh-specific

both Meca 32–positive and PDGFRh-positive cells was seen
predominantly in the intratumoral compartment compared with
the peritumoral tumor stroma separating the tumor nodules
(Fig. 3D, area between the two dotted lines in the right bottom). At

cell lung (Calu-6), and prostate carcinoma (PAC-120), as described
in Supplementary Table S1. Moreover, in a syngeneic rat
glioblastoma model (cell line GS-9L), efficacy was observed at
50, 25, and 10 mg/kg with T/C values of 30%, 45%, and 74%,
respectively (Supplementary Table S1). Pharmacokinetic studies
after p.o. application to mice (Fig. 4C) revealed a maximal plasma
concentration of f1,000 nmol/L at 1 hour and trough plasma
levels below 8 nmol/L at 24 hours postadministration. This
distinctive pharmacokinetic profile can be explained by the rapid
metabolization of BIBF 1120 by methyl ester cleavage, resulting in
the generation of the main metabolite BIBF 1202 containing a free
acid residue (data not shown).

Discussion
This report provides a first pharmacologic profile of the
indolinone derivative BIBF 1120, an inhibitor of VEGFR, PDGFR,
and FGFR tyrosine kinases with the potential to inhibit proangiogenic signaling pathways in vascular endothelial cells, as well as in
pericytes and smooth muscle cells (9, 32), cell types that have
attracted much recent attention as contributors to blood vessel
maturation and stabilization, normal endothelial cell function, and
blood flow regulation (30, 33–35).
In cell cultures, we observed that treatment with BIBF 1120
induces growth arrest and reduced survival. Our data are
consistent with a key role for the VEGFR component in the mode

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

of BIBF 1120 action. The simultaneous inhibition of FGF and PDGF
signaling may open up the possibility to extend the therapeutic
options for this compound in long-term cancer treatment and for
other diseases as well. Indeed, in addition to the antiangiogenic
and anticancer effects described in this study, we have shown in a
separate series of experiments that BIBF 1120 and its close
structural analogue, BIBF 1000, are highly effective in an animal
model of lung fibrosis. As this pathologic condition is strongly
linked to PDGF rather than VEGF signaling (36),3 these data
independently confirm that BIBF 1120 is an effective PDGF
signaling inhibitor in vivo. Our extended biochemical profiling
shows that BIBF 1120 has an attractive overall selectivity pattern in
the human kinome, comparable with sorafinib, vatalanib, or
cediranib (37–39). Of note, we have identified BIBF 1120 as a
highly potent compound active against acute myeloid leukemia
cells driven by Flt3 mutations, which may provide special benefit in
this disease, beyond its antiangiogenic mode of action (29).
The pharmacologic profiling of new generation antiangiogenic
compounds faces a number of technical hurdles. Most importantly,
we and others have found that inhibition of the VEGF/VEGFR
system alone is sufficient to fully suppress a broad range of
standard human xenograft models grown s.c. in immune-deficient

mice (37–39). This contrasts sharply with the clinical observation
that VEGF-targeted therapy with antibodies or small molecule
kinase inhibitors is effective in a subset of cancer patients only and
is commonly of limited duration (10, 40). This discrepancy suggests
that, in patients, compensatory mechanisms that reinstate
angiogenesis over time are triggered and standard cancer xenograft
models are unlikely to reveal the molecular nature of these escape
mechanisms. As a consequence, short-term xenograft models are of
limited value in comparing various small molecule angiokinase
inhibitors, each with a distinct profile of VEGFR, PDGFR, and
FGFR inhibition, with the VEGF-specific antibody bevacizumab
(41), or vatalanib (37), a prototype first-generation VEGFR kinase
inhibitor. A more promising avenue to address the upside potential
of new generation angiogenesis inhibitors may derive from
molecularly defined animal models of cancer (42, 43) with detailed
immunohistochemistry-guided studies of the architecture and
functionality of tumor blood vessels. For instance, Mancuso and
colleagues (34) reported that interfering with VEGF signaling alone
reduces the number of endothelial cells in experimental tumors,
with little effect on the associated vascular extracellular matrix and
pericytes. These pericytes, in turn, served as tracks for rapid
regrowth of endothelial cells upon cessation of VEGF blockade,
suggesting that pericyte depletion could be an attractive added
feature of antiangiogenic treatment. In our image analysis studies
of BIBF 1120–treated FaDu xenografts, we observed a marked
reduction of both the Meca 32–positive endothelial cells and in the
compartment of PDGFRh-labeled mural cells, consistent with a
reduction in pericytes (30) and a loss of tight association between
endothelial cells and pericytes. Together with our test results on
isolated pericytes, it is tempting to speculate that this in vivo effect
is mediated, at least in part, by the PDGFR inhibitory activity of
BIBF 1120. In a separate line of studies, Casanovas and colleagues
(20) have shown that cancer tissues are able to develop resistance
against the VEGF signaling blockade by switching from VEGF
secretion to alternative ligands, notably bFGF. The FGFR inhibition
property of BIBF 1120 may provide the opportunity to address
these types of resistance. Clearly, these investigations need to be
extended and the effects of BIBF 1120 have to be explored in
genetically defined cancer models, such as the RIP-Tag2 model (44),
and in transgenic mouse models with simultaneous ras activation
and p53 loss (42), which also have more delayed growth
characteristics and more organotypic histology compared with
poorly differentiated s.c. cancer xenografts.
BIBF 1120 differs from other angiogenesis inhibitors not only in
its distinctive VEGFR, PDGFR, and FGFR targeting profile but also
with regards to its cellular duration of action and its pharmaco-

kinetics. Regarding its cellular mode of action, we have found a
strikingly sustained inhibition of receptor activation with as yet
unknown mechanistic basis. Using pulse-chase experiments with
cultured cells, we could show that BIBF 1120 blocks VEGFR
activation after a 1-hour exposure for >32 hours, the latest time
point possible under the required cell culture conditions. Whereas
BIBF 1120 is a reversible, ATP pocket-binding inhibitor, as
suggested by our structural information on BIBF 1120-VEGFR
cocrystals, we have not yet been able to determine specific receptor
binding kinetics. However, overlapping these kinetic considerations, we have found that intracellular methylester cleavage of BIBF
1120 results in a compound, BIBF 1202, with a free acid residue and
low cell membrane permeability that retained potent VEGFR-2
kinase inhibition (IC50, 62 nmol/L; data not shown); its cellular
trapping may contribute to the sustained mode of action. This
sustained mode of cellular activity of BIBF 1120 after sufficient
drug exposure may be the essential contributor to the excellent
efficacy observed in tumor models and patients despite the fast in
vivo clearance (45).4 At the same time, there is clinical evidence
that BIBF 1120 lacks some of the side effects associated with other
angiogenesis inhibitors, such as hand-foot syndrome or bone
marrow suppression, as well as hypertension (7, 46). One intriguing
speculation is that the combination of rapid drug clearance and
sustained cellular activity in highly accessible tumor vasculature
may provide a window for antitumor effects combined with low
propensity for hypertensive side effects, a notion that will be
investigated further in the more advanced clinical testing of BIBF
1120.
