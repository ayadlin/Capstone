ABSTRACT
Glioblastomas are highly aggressive adult brain tumors with poor clinical
outcome. In the central nervous system (CNS) the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the
most important limiting factor for both development of new drugs and drug delivery.
Here, we propose a new strategy to treat glioblastoma based on transferrin (Tf)targeted self-assembled nanoparticles (NPs) incorporating zoledronic acid (ZOL)
(NPs-ZOL-Tf). NPs-ZOL-Tf have been assessed on the glioblastoma cell line U373MGLUC that showed a refractoriness in vitro to temozolomide (TMZ) and fotemustine
(FTM). NPs-ZOL-Tf treatment resulted in higher in vitro cytotoxic activity than free
ZOL. However, the potentiation of anti-proliferative activity of NPs-ZOL-Tf was
superimposable to that one induced by NPs-ZOL (not armed with Tf). On the other
hand, NPs-ZOL-Tf showed a higher antitumor efficacy if compared with that one
caused by NPs-ZOL in immunosuppressed mice intramuscularly bearing U373MG-LUC
xenografts, inducing a significant tumor weight inhibition (TWI). The experiments
performed on mice with intracranial U373MG-LUC xenografts confirmed the efficacy
of NPs-ZOL-Tf. These effects were paralleled by a higher intratumour localization
of fluorescently-labeled-NPs-Tf both in intramuscular and intracranial xenografts.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the encapsulation of ZOL increases the
antitumor efficacy of this drug in glioblastoma through the acquisition of ability to
cross the BBB.

INTRODUCTION

randomized patients. An improved survival was largely
restricted to a subset of patients harboring promoter
methylation of DNA repair gene O6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase [2]. Despite the aggressive first-line
therapy, tumors invariably recur and median survival
is 15-18 months and less than 10% of patients are alive
at 5 years. TMZ is the best-documented agent and has
shown a single-agent response rate of 5–8% in GBM,
and of 35% in anaplastic astrocytoma [3]. Recent phase
II trials have demonstrated activity of nitrosoureas such

Glioblastoma [glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)] is
the most common and aggressive type of adult primary
central nervous system tumor. Median survival of
patients with GBM is up-to 40–50 weeks when treated
with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The goldstandard first-line treatment for GBM is based on a
combination of radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ), as
derived from the study by Stupp et al [1] on a total of 573

tumor concentrations [15]. Our group demonstrated that
the use of nanotechnology-based formulations overcomes
these limitations due to bad ZOL pharmaco-distribution
changing this drug in a powerful anticancer agent [9, 16].
On the other hand, nanotechnologies have been
proposed to enhance drug delivery into the CNS [17].
Indeed, drug transport from the bloodstream to the CNS is
hindered by the presence of an endothelium characterized
by a low permeability, namely the BBB, whose cells are
linked by tight junctions hindering the passage of most
drugs [18, 19]. Nanocarriers can access to the brain by
exploiting the enhanced BBB permeability typical of
some intracranial tumors (above all metastases) [17, 20].
Moreover, mechanism of receptor-mediated transcytosis
(RMT) can be used by binding different ligands, such
as transferrin (Tf), to the nanocarrier surface in order to
enhance crossing of the BBB [21]. On the basis of all
these considerations, we proposed a previously developed
delivery system consisting in self-assembling PEGylated
nanoparticles (NPs) [22], based on calcium/phosphate
NPs and cationic liposomes, to deliver ZOL in GBM
cells. However, to improve the delivery of ZOL into the
brain, we developed ZOL-containing NPs (NPs-ZOL)
functionalized with Tf able to bind specific receptors on
endothelial cells of BBB. Moreover, the overexpression
of Tf receptor on the surface of GBM cells could allow
using these newly developed NPs to actively target GBM
cells. The Tf insertion on the NP surface was carried out
maintaining the self-assembling characteristics of the NPs;
consequently, these NPs can be prepared immediately
before use in hospital setting, thus avoiding storage
concerns. These features of the developed NPs should
facilitate their scale-up process and their subsequent
commercial development. In the present manuscript,
we have evaluated the antitumor effects of NPs-ZOL
functionalized or not with transferrin on intramuscularly
and intracranially human GBM xenografts.

as fotemustine (FTM) in recurrent GBM [4, 5]. FTM is a
third-generation nitrosourea with an alkylating cytotoxic
activity, characterized by a phosphoalanine carrier group
grafted onto the nitrosourea radical, which gives it high
lipophilicity that allows it to cross the blood–brain
barrier (BBB) [6, 7]. FTM showed both in vitro and in
vivo marked antineoplastic activity on human GBM and
medulloblastoma cell lines [8].
Despite a broader range of new and more specific
treatment strategies, therapy of GBM remains challenging.
The results found by our group by using zoledronic
acid (ZOL) in different experimental models of solid and
haematological tumors [9-13] encouraged us to investigate
additional potentialities of this drug, for example against
GBM. ZOL is the most potent aminobisphosphonate, able
to induce cell growth inhibition and apoptosis at very
low concentrations [14]. Many authors hypothesize that
a direct anti-tumor activity should be responsible for the
positive effect of ZOL on bone metastases. The lack of
clear evidence of ZOL-induced anti-cancer effects is likely
due to its unfavourable pharmacokinetic profile. In fact, it
accumulates almost exclusively in the bone and has a short
serum half-life (only 15 min) not reaching active antiwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

RESULTS
ZOL-containing self-assembling NPs
The developed self-assembling NPs had a mean
diameter of about 147 nm with a very narrow size
distribution (PI< 0.2) and an actual loading of ~100 µg of
ZOL/mg lipids. The use of Tf in the preparation procedure,
did not significantly affected the NP characteristics in
terms of size and ZOL encapsulation.

the standard antineoplastic drugs, TMZ and FTM, on
U373MG-LUC GBM cells, we treated the cells with
increasing concentrations of free ZOL, NPs-ZOL, NPsZOL-Tf, TMZ and FTM for 72h. Cell proliferation was
assessed by MTT assay and cell survival by clonogenic
assay, as described in “Materials and Methods”.
After 72h of treatment, we showed that the
encapsulation in NPs increased the efficacy of ZOL.
In fact, the analysis of U373MG-LUC growth in terms
of MTT assay (Figure 1A) demonstrated that free ZOL
induced the 50% growth inhibition at a concentration of
46 μM (IC50) (Table 1). This effect was enhanced when the
ZOL was encapsulated into NPs; in fact, NPs-ZOL showed
an IC50 equal to 20 µM in U373MG-LUC,that is more than
half compared to the free drug. In the other hand, NPsZOL-Tf showed a decrease of IC50 compared to free ZOL
but not respect to NPs-ZOL (IC50 30 µM) (Table 1).

Figure 1: NPs- ZOL-Tf have cytotoxic activity on U373
MG- LUC cells. A). U373 MG- LUC GBM cells (2×103) were

seeded in 96-well plates in serum-containing media and allowed
to attach for 24 hrs. The medium was then removed and replaced
with new medium containing TMZ (●), FTM (○), ZOL (◊), NPsZOL (■) and NPs-ZOL-Tf (∆) at different concentrations. Cells
were incubated under these conditions for a time course spanning
72 hrs. Then cell viability was assessed with MTT method. The
MTT solution (5.0 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline) was
added (20 µL/well), and the plates were incubated for further 4
hrs at 37° C. The purple formazan crystals were dissolved in 200
µL isopropanol per well. After the plates were read on microplate
reader at 540 nm. The figure shows representative experiments
performed in triplicate with SDs. B). U373 MG- LUC cells were
seeded in 60 mm- Petri dishes at a density of 5 x104 cells/ plate
in RPMI medium. After 24 hours, cells were treated with TMZ
(●), FTM (○), ZOL (◊), NPs-ZOL (■) or NPs-ZOL-Tf (∆) for 72
hrs at different concentrations. To evaluate cell colony- forming
ability, at the end of treatments cells were trypsinized, counted
and aliquots from each sample were seeded in triplicate in 60
mm dishes into complete medium at a density of 500 cells. After
10 days colonies were stained with 2% methylene blue in 95%
of ethanol and counted (> 50 cells equaled one colony). Data
are means ± SD of 3 independent experiments. The survival
of cells treated with NPs-ZOL-Tf was significantly decreased
(P< 0.01) compared to untreated and to all treated groups. C)

Anti-cancer agents conventionally used in the
clinic for the treatment of GBM are TMZ and FTM. In
particular, TMZ is currently used in combination with
radiation therapy or alone after surgery and radiotherapy
[1, 2]. On these bases, we evaluated the cytotoxic effects
of the TMZ and FTM on this GBM cell line. After 72h
the IC50 of TMZ was 110 μM for U373MG-LUC and this
line was highly resistant to the treatment with FTM with
an IC50 of more than 600 μM, thus suggesting an in vitro
refractoriness of human GBM cells both to TMZ and FTM
(Table 1).
These observations were confirmed when the
efficacy of different formulations was analyzed in terms
of clonogenic assay (Figure 1 B). In fact, the IC50 of free
ZOL was 21 μM and decreased to 18 μM for NPs-ZOL
and to 12 for μM NPs-ZOL-Tf. Also in the clonogenic
assay, U373MG-LUC cells exhibited low sensitivity to
TMZ and a strong resistance to FTM.
In all cases, empty NPs did not reduce growth
and survival of cells if not at high concentrations
demonstrating a very low cytotoxicity (data not shown).

that all treatments were well tolerated by the animals, as
no toxic deaths (Table I) or weight loss were recorded in
animals.

Effects on intra-tissue distribution of fluorescent
NPs at confocal microscopy.
With the aim to study the intra-tissue biodistribution of NPs, we performed confocal microscopy
analysis of tumor tissues collected at different times from
mice intramuscularly bearing GBM tumours, injected
with fluorescently-labeled-NPs. Mice were administered
i.v. with a single dose of fluorescently labeled NPs-ZOL
or NPs-ZOL-Tf and analysis was performed for content
in cells from tumors at 6h, 12h and 24h after injection.
Untreated control was assumed as negative control.
Results revealed that after 6h, NP-ZOL-Tf uptake
was markedly increased as compared to negative control
and NP-ZOL treated group. NPs accumulation decreased
in a time-dependent manner after 12h (Figure 4). The
quantitative representation of the results is shown in
Supplementary Figure 1.

Antitumor effect of NPs-ZOL formulations
against heterotopic GBM xenografts.
To study the in vivo effects of NP formulations,
we inoculated i.m. 3 x 106 U373MG-LUC cells into
immunosuppressed mice. U-373MG-LUC cells allow the
in vivo monitoring of tumor growth by imaging performed
as a function of the bioluminescent signal generated by the
catalysis of D-luciferin, injected in the animal at the time
of imaging.
After 6 days, when the tumor mass became palpable
and visible by luminescence analysis, mice were divided
into five groups: untreated mice, mice treated with free
ZOL, with empty nanoparticles functionalized with
transferrin, with NPs-ZOL and with NPs-ZOL-Tf. The
growth curves of U373MG-LUC tumors treated with
the different formulations are reported in figure 2. NPsZOL-Tf exhibited the highest antitumor efficacy. In fact,
as summarized in table I, this treatment produced, at
nadir of the effect, a significant (P= 0.009 vs untreated)
tumor weight inhibition of about 41%, while the nonfunctionalized NPs-ZOL caused an about 31% tumour
growth inhibition (P= 0.02) while free ZOL did not
determine a particularly marked tumor growth inhibition
(TWI 20%). The therapeutic activity of NPs-ZOL-Tf is
also demonstrated by the significant (P= 0.03) delay of
tumor growth (10 days) and by the increase of life survival
of mice (23%). Interestingly, this treatment produced
a complete tumor response in 1 out of six treated mice,
while NPs-ZOL produce a stabilization of disease in 1
out of six treated mice. These data were also confirmed
by the bioluminescence analysis of tumor growth during
the treatment (Figure 3). Finally, it is interesting to note

the NP-ZOL and NP-ZOL-Tf content in cells from tumor at
6h, 12h and 24h after injection. Mice treated with vehicle were

Antitumor efficacy of NPs-ZOL formulations
against orthotopic GBM

To evaluate the ability of NPs formulation to cross
the BBB and accumulate in the brain of mice bearing
orthotopic tumors, mice were intra-cranially injected with
U373MG-LUC and two weeks after tumor cell injection,
treated with FITC/TRITC-double labelled NPs-ZOL or
NPs-ZOL-Tf, given i.v. at 20 μg/ mouse. Frozen brain
sections were examined by fluorescence microscope after
nuclear DAPI counterstain. The higher accumulation of
NPs-ZOL-Tf than NPs-ZOL was evident in the tumor
mass already 6 hours after the injection of FITC/TRITCNPs-ZOL-Tf. The marked presence of NPs-ZOL-Tf in the
brain was still observed 24 hours after the treatment, while
the signal in the brain treated with NPs-ZOL was nearly
undetectable (Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure 2). In
particular, NPs-ZOL-Tf were evident in the tumor mass
developed in the basal brain nuclei (Bbn) from a mouse
sacrificed 6 hours after the first injection of FITC/TRITCNPs-ZOL-Tf (Figure 6 A). After 3 consecutive weeks
where FITC/ TRITC-NPs-ZOL-Tf was given three times
a week, most of the NPs-ZOL were present in the tumor
mass developed in the brain cortex (Bc) but also some
brain cortex cells appeared to contain the NPs (Figure 6
B). Moreover, the presence of a yellow fluorescence, due
to the co-localization of the two dyes used to label NPs,
suggests the presence of NPs still intact into the tissue
(Figure 6).

Based on fluorescence microscopy analysis
demonstrating the ability of both NPs-ZOL and NPsZOL-Tf to overcome the BBB and to accumulate in
brain of mice bearing GBM tumours, we subsequently
evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of these formulations.
We inoculated intrabrain 2.5 x105 U-373MG-LUC cells
into immuno-compromised mice. This tumor model
closely recapitulated histological phenotypes consistent
with those of human GBM. After 8 days, when the
tumor mass became visible by biolumincence analysis,
the mice were divided into four groups: untreated mice,
mice treated with empty NPs functionalized with Tf, with
NPs-ZOL functionalized with Tf and mice treated with
NPs-ZOL. As reported in Figure 7 and Table II, NPsZOL formulations were effective in limiting the growth
of GBM and in particular, NPs-ZOL-Tf reduced tumor
mass and cured some of treated animals. In fact, while all
untreated or blank NPs-treated mice showed a progression
of the disease, treatment with NPs-ZOL produced the
stabilization of the disease in 2 out of eight mice treated.
Interestingly, NPs-ZOL-Tf elicited a stronger antitumor
effect determining the tumor mass stabilization in 2 out
of eight mice and a decrease followed by the complete
disappearance of the tumor in 1 out of eight mice (Figure
7 A). At that time, more than six months after the end of

treatment, the mouse with complete tumor regression was
still alive and in good conditions and bioluminescence
analysis did not show the presence of tumor cells in mouse
brain. After, tumor progressed in this mouse and the death
was reported at day 370 after tumor cells injection (Fig.
7C). The higher activity of NPs-ZOL-Tf if compared
to NPs-ZOL was also demonstrated by the increase of
overall survival of mice (23 vs 13%, respectively), while
treatment with blank NPs-Tf was ineffective.
Interestingly, NPs formulations were well tolerated
as no toxic deaths or body weight loss was reported in

animals (Table II and III).
Overall, our results clearly demonstrate the
therapeutic efficacy of NPs-ZOL-Tf against experimental
models of human GBM, even on orthotopic tumours that
closely mimic the clinical setting.

the access of anti-cancer agents, to the CNS. Thus, the
development of formulations able to deliver drugs into the
brain is becoming a promising option in order to control
this type of malignancy.
In previous works we demonstrated that ZOL, a
third generation aminobisphosphonate, can be transformed
in a powerful anticancer agent, if administered with
nanotechnology-based formulations [9, 22]. In this
work, we investigated if this approach can be proposed
also in the treatment of GBM. Nanotechnologies have
been widely used for the targeted delivery of anticancer
drugs [19, 23]. Brain tumors are generally characterized
by vasogenic oedema with dramatic increase of the
intracranial pressure, and consequent breakdown of the
BBB, associated with down-regulation of tight junction
[24]. In this condition, colloidal particles can access to the
CNS thus bringing their drug cargo into the brain [17].
First experiments were performed in vitro, where we found
that ZOL, only when encapsulated in the self-assembling
NPs, has antiproliferative activity against U373 MGLUC GBM cells. In the case of GBM, anti-cancer agents
conventionally used in the clinic for the treatment of GBM
are TMZ and FTM. In particular, TMZ, which represents
the gold standard treatment in GBM, is currently used in
combination with radiation therapy or alone after surgery
and radiotherapy [1, 2]. On these bases, we evaluated the
cytotoxic effects of the TMZ and FTM on U373 MG- LUC
GBM cells. The cell line showed refractoriness in vitro to
treatment with either TMZ or FTM. On the other hand,
NP-ZOL was much more potent than TMZ and FTM in
inducing growth inhibition of GBM cells. Active targeting
has been also used to enhance drug delivery into the CNS.
In particular, ligands for specific receptors have been used
to promote NP access to the brain [25, 26]. Among them,
Tf receptors are highly present on the endothelial cells of
the BBB for the regulation of brain uptake of iron [27].
Moreover, Tf receptors are overexpressed in almost all
cancers and, according to this, we found overexpression of
Tf receptors also in U-373MG-LUC cells (data submitted
for publication). Starting from these considerations, the
previously developed self-assembling NPs were modified
with Tf electrostatically bound to their surface in order
to potentiate their delivery efficacy against GBM cells
and to enhance crossing of the BBB. Thus, the following
step of the work was to investigate if the presence of Tf
in the formulation could affect the ZOL activity in vitro.
Our results show that both NPs-ZOL and NP-ZOL-Tf
induced a much more cytotoxic activity than standard
cytotoxic agents in GBM cells. In particular, in clonogenic
assay NP-ZOL-Tf resulted more effective in reducing the
survival of cells comparing NPs-ZOL. This improved
effect of NP-ZOL-Tf was not evident in MTT assay.
This is not surprising when one considers that clonogenic
assay is a long-term assay in which the ability of NPsZOL-Tf to increase the amount of drugs in cells, could
be fully exploited. The increase of the effectiveness of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ZOL-encapsulated into self-assembling NPs compared to
free ZOL was also confirmed by the in vivo experiments.
In particular, in a heterotopic model of GBM, NP-ZOLTf induced an about 41%, NP-ZOL an about 31% and
free ZOL an about 20% inhibition of tumor growth,
respectively. The greater effectiveness of NPs-ZOL-Tf
if compared to NPs-ZOL in vivo, could be due to active
targeting of tumor cells overexpressing the Tf receptors,
that could also enhance the NP uptake into the cells [28].
Moreover, the presence of Tf on the NPs-ZOL-Tf may
enhance accumulation into the tumor, by interaction with
the Tf receptors expressed on the endothelial cells of the
vessels irrorating the tissue [29]. This hypothesis seems
to correlate with confocal microscopy analysis of tumor
tissues excised by mice treated with fluorescent NPs.
Indeed, confocal microscopy images showed that the
presence of NPs in tumor tissues was significantly higher
in mice treated with NPs-ZOL-Tf than in mice treated with
NP-ZOL.
A major obstacle in the clinical management of
GBM is the presence of BBB, which restricts the entrance
of circulating therapeutics in the brain tissue. Therefore,
we investigated the antitumor effect of the developed
formulations in an orthotopic model of GBM. We found
that NPs-ZOL significantly reduced the tumor growth with
stabilization of the disease in 2 out of eight treated mice.
This is not surprising because GBM itself can disrupt BBB
integrity, through mechanisms such as secretion of soluble
factors that actively degrade tight junctions [30], as well
as formation of abnormal blood vessels with defective
expression of tight junction proteins [31, 32]. NPs-ZOL
can access to the brain taking advantage of the enhanced
permeability of BBB. However, while large and advanced
brain tumors exhibit especially disrupted BBB integrity,
subregions with intact BBB are also present in areas of less
advanced brain tumors, which hamper the uptake of drugs
leading to cancer cell treatment resistance. Therefore, NPs
modification with Tf, in order to target Tf receptor highly
expressed in the BBB endothelial cells, should result in
enhanced brain delivery of ZOL by transcytosis. Finally,
the targeting of Tf-overexpressing GBM cells could lead
to additional increase of ZOL antitumor activity on GBM.
Therefore, to verify the validity of our hypothesis, we
compared the efficacy of the NPs-ZOL and NPs-ZOL-Tf
in an orthotopic model of GBM, in which the NPs have
to overcome the BBB to access the tumor. Interestingly,
the dual BBB and tumor targeting strategy resulted in a
marked therapeutic efficacy of NPs-ZOL-Tf since, in
mice treated with this formulation, a stabilization of the
disease and a complete response with regression of tumor
and cure in some cases were observed. These results
were supported by the fluorescence images in which a
significant fluorescence associated to the NPs was found
only in the tumor tissues excised from animal treated with
NPs-ZOL-Tf. Interestingly, especially after 6 h from the
inoculation, the NPs were found especially into the tumor

mass, probably, indicating effective tumor targeting. The
co-localization of the two fluorescently dye, namely cholBIODIPY and DHPE-CF, suggest that intact NP should
arrive into the tumor. Further studies should be required
to clarify the intracellular pathway of the Tf-modified or
unmodified NPs, and the mechanism of ZOL release into
the cytoplasm.
In conclusion, this manuscript provides evidence
that the newly developed formulation NPs-ZOL-Tf,
allows the successfully use of ZOL against GBM.
Although we did not give conclusive evidence of the ZOL
entry into the brain, in this work, we reported that this
bisphosphonate, when encapsulated in self-assembling
NPs have an antitumor activity on GBM. On the other
hand, it is well known that ZOL when given free have no
pharmacological effect in CNS [33]. The NPs modification
with Tf allowed the achievement of enhanced antitumor
activity in a heterotopic model of GBM. The advantage
of Tf introduction into the formulation was more evident
when investigating the effect of the NPs-ZOL-Tf in an
orthotopic model of GBM, in which the drug has not only
to reach the tumor, but also to cross the BBB. The results
observed in this experimental animal model, namely the
stabilization of the tumor in all the animal and complete
regression in one out of eight, opens a new scenario in
which it could have a strong impact for the treatment of
brain tumors, for which a paucity of effective treatments
exists.

Preparation of ZOL-containing self-assembling
NPs
In this study, we modified the surface of previously
developed NPs-ZOL with human Tf. In detail, Tf modified
NPs-ZOL were prepared as follows. In a first step,
PEGylated cationic liposomes consisting of DOTAP/
chol/DSPE-PEG2000 (1:1:0.5 weight ratio) were prepared
by hydration of a thin lipid film followed by extrusion.
The lipid mixture was dissolved in 1 ml of a mixture
chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v). The organic solution
was removed by N2, and the film was further dried under
vacuum. Then, the lipid film was hydrated with 1 ml of
sterile water and the resulting dispersion was extruded
using a thermobarrel extruder system. In a second step,
pre-formed PEGylated cationic liposomes were mixed
with human Tf (10 mg/ml in phosphate buffer at pH 8.0)
at a volume ratio of 1:1, at room temperature for 15 min,
obtaining the so-called Tf-PEGylated cationic liposomes.
Separately, calcium phosphate nanoparticles (CaP NPs)
containing ZOL were prepared as previously described
by Salzano G et al., [22]. Briefly, an aqueous solution
of calcium chloride (18 mM) was added, dropwise and
under magnetic stirring, to an aqueous solution on dibasic
hydrogen phosphate (10.8 mM). The pH of both solutions
was adjusted beforehand to 9.5 with NaOH 0.1M. CaP
NPs were obtained by filtration of the suspension through
a 0.22 μm filter. The dispersion was then mixed with an
aqueous solution of ZOL (50 mg/ml of ZOL in phosphate
buffer at pH 9.5), resulting in CaP NPs containing ZOL
(CaPZ NPs). Finally, NPs-ZOL-Tf were prepared by
mixing Tf-PEGylated cationic liposomes complex with
CaPZ NPs, at a volume ratio of 1:0.5, at room temperature
for 15 min. Plain Tf-modified NPs (NPs-Tf), ZOLencapsulating NP without Tf (NPs-ZOL) and plain NPs
were prepared similarly. Each formulation was prepared
in triplicate. Fluorescently labelled NPs were prepared
similarly, by introducing Cholesteryl 4,4-Difluoro-5(4-Methoxyphenyl)-4-Bora-3a,4a-Diaza-s-Indacene-3Undecanoate (chol-BODIPY) (Life Technologies, USA)
e 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N(carboxyfluorescein) ammonium salt (DHPE-CF) (Avanti
Polar, USA) in the lipid mix, in the following ratio
DOTAP/chol/DSPE-PEG2000/chol-BODIPY/DHPE-CF
(1:1:0.5:0.025:0.025 weight ratio).

of about 300mg was evident) mice were randomized,
divided in five groups and treatment started. The following
groups were evaluated: untreated; free ZOL; empty NPs
plus transferrin (NPs-Tf); ZOL-encapsulating NPs (NPsZOL) and ZOL-encapsulating NPs plus transferrin (NPsZOL-Tf). Mice were treated intravenously (i.v.) with NPs
or with 20 μg of free ZOL, NPs-ZOL or NPs-ZOL- Tf
for three times a week for 3 consecutive weeks. This
scheduling of treatment was chosen based on previous
published experiments [16].
Tumor sizes were measured three times a week
in two dimensions by a caliper and tumor weight
was calculated using the following formula: a×b2/2,
where a and b are the long and short sizes of the tumor,
respectively. Antitumor efficacy of treatments was
assessed by the following end-points: a) percent tumor
weight inhibition (TWI%); b) tumor growth delay,
evaluated as T - C, where T and C are the median times
for treated and control tumors, respectively, to achieve
equivalent size; c) complete tumor regression, defined as
tumor disappearance, as evaluated by palpability, lasting
for at least 10 days during or after treatment period; d)
increase of mice survival by euthanizing the animals, for
ethical reasons, when the tumors reached 3 g in weight; e)
stable disease, defined as the maintenance for at least three
weeks of the same tumor weight as the start of treatment; f)
complete response, defined as the disappearance of tumor,
for at least three weeks in the course of treatment. Each
experimental group included six mice and experiments
were repeated at least twice.
For orthotopic experiments, mice were anesthetized
with a combination of tiletamine–zolazepam (Telazol,
Virbac, Carros, France) and xylazine (xylazine/ Rompun
BAYER) given intramuscularly at 2 mg/kg and injected
intracranially with U373MG-LUC cells at 2.5 x 105 cells/
mouse, through the center-middle area of the frontal bone
to a 2-mm depth, using a 0.1-mL glass microsyringe and a
27-gauge disposable needle. One hour prior to intracranial
implantation, the mice were weighed and pre-medicated
with an orally administration of 0.5 mg/ kg/d of Metacam
(meloxicam) in saline to control for post-operative pain
and inflammation. The medication was carried out until the
end of the experiment. Animals were closely monitored by
visual inspection and weighed daily from start of treatment
and sacrificed when signs of tumor burden (especially
weight loss >20% and severe neurological dysfunction)
were evident. The time to this moment since GBM cells
injection is considered as ‘survival time’. Mice were
treated i.v., starting at day 8 after cells injection, with
Blank NPs-Tf, NPs-ZOL and NPs-ZOL-Tf at 20 µg/
mouse for three time a week for 3 consecutive weeks.
Experiments with ZOL given free were not performed due
to the well-known inability of this drug to cross the BBB
[33]. Each experimental group included eight mice and
experiments were repeated twice.

The mean diameter of NPs was determined at 20°C
by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) (N5, Beckman
Coulter, Miami, USA). Each sample was diluted in
deionizer/filtered water (0.22 µm pore size, polycarbonate
filters, MF-Millipore, Microglass Heim, Italy) and
analyzed with detector at 90° angle. As measure of the
particle size distribution, polydispersity index (P.I.) was
used. For each batch, mean diameter and size distribution
were the mean of three measures. For each formulation,
the mean diameter and P.I. were calculated as the mean of
three different batches. The zeta-potential (ζ) of the NPs
surface was measured in water by means of a Zetasizer
Nano Z (Malvern, UK). Data of ζ were collected as the
average of 20 measurements. ZOL analysis was carried out
by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography
(RP-HPLC) as previously reported [22]. The incorporation
efficiency of ZOL in NPs-ZOL-Tf was determined as
follows: 1 ml of NPs dispersion was ultracentrifuged
(Optima Max E, Beckman Coulter, USA) at 80.000 rpm
at 4°C for 40 min. Supernatant was carefully removed and
analyzed to determine un-incorporated ZOL concentration
by RP-HPLC. The results have been expressed as
complexation efficiency, calculated as the ratio between
the amount of ZOL present in the supernatant and the
amount of ZOL theoretical loaded.

Cell lines and cytotoxic assay
Human U373MG GBM cells were transfected
with pcDNA3-luc (U373MG-LUC) as previously
described [34] and were grown in RPMI medium in a
humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. After
trypsinization, the cells were plated in 100μL of medium
in 96-well plates at a density of 2 x 103 per well. One
day later, the cells were treated with free ZOL, NPs-ZOL
functionalized or not with transferrin, TMZ and FTM at
increasing concentrations. Cell proliferation was evaluated
by MTT as previously described [35]. In clonogenic assay,
the cells were seeded at 5 x 104 cells/plate and exposed 24
hrs later to TMZ and FTM for 48 hrs and to NPs-ZOL and
NPs-ZOL-Tf for 72 hrs. Cell survival was evaluated as
previously described [36].

In vivo experiments
CD-1 male nude (nu/nu) mice, 6–8 weeks old and
weighing 22–24 g were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories (Calco, Italy). For heterotopic experiments,
immunosuppressed mice were injected intramuscularly
(i.m.) into the hind leg muscles of mice at 3x106 U373MGLUC GBM cells /mouse. After 6 days (when a tumor mass

Statistical analysis

Mice bearing i.m. or intra brain U373MG-LUC
tumors were imaged using the IVIS imaging system 200
series (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA, USA).
Briefly, mice were anesthetized with a combination of
tiletamine–zolazepam (Telazol, Virbac, Carros, France)
and xylazine (xylazine/ Rompun BAYER) given
intramuscularly at 2 mg/kg. Then mice were injected
intraperitoneally with 150 mg/kg D-luciferin (Caliper
Life Sciences), and imaged in the supine position 10
min after luciferin injection. Imaging was performed at
baseline before the start compound administration and
several times during the experiment. Data were acquired
and analyzed using the living image software version 3.0
(Caliper Life Sciences).

The Student’s t-test (unpaired, two-tailed) was used
for comparing statistical differences. Survival curves
of mice were generated by Kaplan–Maier product-limit
estimate, and statistical differences between the various
groups were evaluated by log-rank analysis with Yates
correction (software Primer of Biostatistics, McGrawHill, New York, NY, USA). Differences were considered
statistically significant when P< 0.05.

Analysis of intratissue distribution of fluorescent
NPs at confocal microscopy
Mice were injected i.m. with 3 x 106 U373 MGLUC cells/mouse and treated with fluorescent NPsZOL and NPs-ZOL-Tf for 6, 12 and 24h. At the end of
the experiment, mice were sacrificed and tumors were
excised. Frozen sections of tumor tissues were cut with
a cryostat on a slide. Tissues were fixed for 20 minutes
with a solution at 3% of paraformaldehyde (PFA) and
permeabilized for 10 minutes with 0.1% Triton X-100
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature.
After several washes the slides were mounted on
microscope slides by DAPI. The analyses were performed
with a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope equipped with a planapochromat objective X 63 (NA 1.4) in oil immersion. The
fluorescence of the Alexa 488 and Alexa 633 was collected
in multi-track mode using as emission filters a BP505-530
and LP650 a respectively.
