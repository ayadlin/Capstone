ABSTRACT
Immune checkpoint signaling plays an important role in immunosuppression
in multiple myeloma (MM). Blood levels of soluble programmed death-ligand
1 (sPD-L1), a checkpoint-relevant protein, might predict treatment response and
survival outcomes in MM patients. We used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
to measure serum sPD-L1 levels in 81 newly diagnosed MM patients. We found that
myeloma patients had higher sPD-L1 concentrations than healthy controls. The best
sPD-L1 cutoff value for predicting disease progression risk was 2.783 ng/mL. The
overall response rate to treatment was higher in low sPD-L1 patients than in high
sPD-L1 patients. The 3-year progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
rates for all patients were 16% and 64%, respectively. Multivariate survival analysis
including Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score, treatment
response, and sPD-L1 level showed that a less than partial treatment response (PR)
and higher sPD-L1 levels (>2.783 ng/ml) were independent prognostic factors for
shorter PFS; neither factor was predictive of OS. The serum sPD-L1 level is a valuable
biomarker for predicting treatment response and an independent prognostic factor
for PFS. PD-1/ PD-L1 blockade may be a promising novel immune-based therapeutic
strategy in MM.

mechanisms to overcome drug resistance are an area of
active research. Furthermore, biomarkers that can predict
patients’ drug response would be helpful in choosing
optimal treatment strategies for MM.
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are an
important component of the immune response to tumors.
However, in patients with various types of cancer,
lymphocyte activity is inhibited [6]. The programmed
death 1 (PD-1) receptor protein acts as an immune
checkpoint, suppressing T-cell mediated immune response
[7]. PD-1 is typically expressed by activated lymphocytes,
and it has two ligands: PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2.

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a fatal plasma cell
malignancy that mainly affects older individuals [1].
Achieving a complete response to treatment is crucial
for long-term control of MM [2–4]. The advent of novel
proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs has
improved response rates and progression-free survival
(PFS) [5]. However, MM remains incurable, and nearly
all patients eventually relapse and succumb to the disease.
Drug resistance is a major challenge in treating relapses of
MM. Thus, alternative treatment methods that target novel

Ligand binding down-regulates antigen-stimulated
lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production,
ultimately resulting in lymphocyte ‘exhaustion’ and the
induction of immune invasion [7–9]. Inhibition of these
checkpoints can restore immune activity against cancer
cells. Recent clinical trials show that PD-1–blocking
antibodies can enhance immunity in solid tumors and
several hematologic malignancies, resulting in durable
clinical responses [10–13].
Previous studies have found that myeloma cells
express PD-L1, and proinflammatory signals increase
this expression [14–16]. Gorgun et al. [17] demonstrated
that PD-1/PD-L1 blockade reduced bone marrow stroma
cell (BMSC)-induced tumor growth. Furthermore,
lenalidomide significantly reduced PD-L1 expression in
MM cells, and combining lenalidomide with PD-1/PD-L1
blockade further decreased BMSC-induced MM growth.
Thus, immune checkpoint signaling plays an important
role in promoting tumor growth and suppressing immune
response in MM. Targeting checkpoint signaling using

PD-1 and PD-L1 blocking antibodies is a promising novel
immune-based therapeutic strategy for MM. Rossille
et al. [18] recently found that the soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1)
concentration in blood could predict overall survival and
treatment response in diffuse large B cell lymphoma
(DLBCL). In this study, we investigated the expression of
sPD-L1 in MM patients, and explored the value of sPD-L1
levels in predicting treatment response.

RESULTS
Patients’ characteristics and correlation with
sPD-L1 level
As is shown in Table 1, most patients (77.8%)
were male, and more than half (55.6%) were under
than 60 years old. The stages were balanced among
stage I (32.1%), II (38.3%) and III (29.6%). About 40%
of patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group

myeloma patients was 2.851 ng/mL, much higher than that
of healthy controls (0.716 ng/mL, p < 0.0001, Figure 1).
There was no significant correlation between sPD-L1
level and gender, age, International staging system (ISS)
stage, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, renal function,
or treatment regimens (p > 0.05). However, patients with
poor performance status (PS) had higher sPD-L1 levels
(p = 0.005).

(= < 2.783 ng/mL). The CR rate in the high sPD-L1 group
was 8.3% (3 of 36 patients), while in the low sPD-L1
group it was 20.0% (p = 0.249). The overall response rate
(ORR, including CR and PR) was 66.7% in low sPD-L1
group, significantly higher than the high sPD-L1 group
(33.3%, p = 0.006). The ORR was significantly higher
in patients treated with novel drug-based regimens than
those with older drug-based regimens (69.2% vs. 43.6%,
p = 0.036).

Survival analysis

Treatment response and correlation with
sPD-L1 level

At a median follow-up time of 38 months (range
2–69 months), disease progression occurred in 51
patients at a median of 12 months (range 2–41 months),
and 19 patients died of tumor progression at a median
of 18 months (range 2–45 months). The 3-year PFS and
OS rates were 16% and 64%, respectively. As is shown
in Figure 3 and Table 2, patients with lower sPD-L1
levels (= < 2.783 ng/ml), good ECOG PS score (0–2),
and good treatment response (CR+PR) had higher PFS
and OS rates (p < 0.05). However, age, ISS stage, LDH
level, and different treatment regimens did not affect
long-term outcomes (p > 0.05). A multivariate survival
analysis including ECOG PS score, treatment response,
and sPD-L1 level showed that both less than PR to

After at least 4 cycles of treatment, 12 patients
(15%) showed a complete response (CR), and 42 patients
(51.9%) showed at least a partial response (PR). As is
shown in Table 1, patients with less than PRs tended
to have higher sPD-L1 levels than those with at least a
PR (p = 0.099). As is shown in Figure 2, the best cutoff
value defined by ROC curve for sPD-L1 in predicting
high risk for disease progression is 2.783 ng/mL, with an
AUC of 0.655 (p = 0.018). According to this cutoff value,
36 patients (44.4%) were classified as the high sPD-L1
level group (>2.783 ng/mL), and the remaining 45 patients
(55.6%) were classified as the low sPD-L1 level group

treatment and higher sPD-L1 levels (>2.783 ng/ml) were
independent prognostic factors for lower PFS, but neither
was predictive of OS.

(0.533 ng/ml and 0.443 ng/mL, respectively). Moreover,
the sPD-L1 level could be increased by co-culturing the
cells with pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IFN-γ)
(see Supplemental Figure-1A and 1B). Since PD-1/PD-L1
signaling promotes tumor growth while inhibiting antitumor immune responses, the correlation between sPD-L1
and disease progression is not surprising. More interestingly,
the lack of correlation between sPD-L1 levels and cancer
stage suggests that sPD-L1 increases may represent an
aggressive characteristic rather than increased tumor load.
Our study revealed that high pretreatment serum
sPD-L1 levels and low treatment response (less than
PR) were independent prognostic factors for lower
PFS. Additionally, serum sPD-L1 level was a strong
predictor of treatment response, suggesting that sPD-L1
plays a key role in MM progression and chemotherapy
resistance. The mechanisms by which elevated sPD-L1
levels contribute to poor prognosis in MM are not
clear, but there are several possible explanations. For
example, in addition to inhibiting tumor-specific CTLs,
PD-L1 binding to PD-1 induces drug resistance in MM
cells via the Akt signaling pathway [19]. Additionally,
PD-1-induced resistance to anti-myeloma agents is
reduced by the PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 [19].
Further studies are needed to identify how PD1/PD-L1
signaling impacts MM prognosis.
Patients achieving CR have a much better
prognoses, regardless of whether they are newly diagnosed
or relapse/refractory patients [3, 25, 26]. In this study,
we found that good treatment response (CR+PR) is a
favorable prognostic factor in MM. Moreover, we found
that the ORR was higher in patients treated with novel
drug regimens than in those with older drug regimens
(69.2% vs. 43.6%, p = 0.036). However, higher ORR
failed to translate into a survival advantage in terms of
OS. Clinical trials demonstrate that although novel drug
regimens improve the ORR, most could not prolong the
OS compared to older drug regimens [27, 28]. Therefore,
although novel drugs like bortezomib and lenalidomide
improve treatment efficacy, novel anti-myeloma drugs
with different mechanisms may help improve long-term
survival. Immune-based therapeutic strategies that target
checkpoint signaling with PD-1- or PD-L1-blocking
antibodies might both inhibit tumor cell growth and
restore host immune function in MM.
Although our findings suggest that sPD-L1 levels
influence MM prognosis, additional studies could provide
stronger evidence. Our conclusions are limited due to the
retrospective nature of this study, the diverse therapeutic
regimens of the patients examined, and the lack of
cytogenetic and molecular abnormality analyses for most
patients. Future studies should be conducted in a larger
sample of patients receiving uniform treatment to verify
both the prognostic relevance of pretreatment sPD-L1
levels and the cut-off value of 2.783 ng/mL we used to
define high sPD-L1.

DISCUSSION
Blockade of the PD1-PDL1 pathway is a new and
promising therapeutic approach in MM. We investigated
serum levels of sPD-L1 in a large series of MM patients
to identify any correlations with patient characteristics
and survival outcomes. We found that serum sPD-L1
concentrations in MM patients were much higher than in
normal healthy people. In MM patients, serum sPD-L1
levels were correlated with ECOG PS score, but not
with any other clinical feature. However, increased
pretreatment serum sPD-L1 levels were associated with
poor treatment responses. Furthermore, a Cox regression
model including ECOG PS score, treatment response,
and sPD-L1 level showed that a higher sPD-L1 level
(>2.783 ng/mL) was a noteworthy independent prognostic
factor for lower PFS.
In recent years, the roles of PD-1 and PD-L1 in
tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance have been
extensively studied. Surface PD-L1 expression is high in
MM cells [14, 16, 17], and direct interaction between
PD-L1 on myeloma cells and PD-1 on T cells induces
resistance to anti-myeloma chemotherapy [19]. In this
study, we detected significantly higher levels of sPD-L1
in patients with MM compared to healthy controls.
Furthermore, higher sPD-L1 levels (>2.783 ng/mL) were
correlated with poor treatment response and lower PFS.
Serum sPD-L1 concentrations in healthy donors increase
with age, suggesting that levels of circulating sPD-L1
are associated with the health of an individual’s immune
system [20]. However, the sources of sPD-L1 remain
unknown. Generally, soluble forms of similar ligands
are produced primarily through proteolytic cleavage of
membrane-bound proteins such as sB7-H3 [21]. A small
portion is also produced by translation of alternatively
spliced mRNA, as is the case for sCTLA-4 [22].
sPD-L1 was detectable in supernatants from membrane
PD-L1 +, but not PD-L1 -, cell lines, indicating that PD-L1
expressed on the cell surface may be a source of sPD-L1
[20]. It is possible that soluble and membrane-bound
PD-L1 bind to PD-1 similarly; thus, sPD-L1 may play an
important role in the regulation of immune activity.
Whether non-MM cells produce sPD-L1 remains
unknown. Rossille et al. [18] did not find an association
between plasma sPD-L1 levels and tumor PD-L1
expression in DLBCL patients, suggesting that nonmalignant cells in the tumor microenvironment can
produce sPD-L1 in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines
[23, 24]. We previously measured sPD-L1 levels in
supernatants from two myeloma cell lines (U266 and
RPMI8226) and found that both lines produced sPD-L1

In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate
the relationship between serum sPD-L1 levels and MM
prognosis, including treatment response and disease
progression. Serum sPD-L1, which can be easily measured
in clinical practice, may be an important independent
prognostic factor for this disease. These results suggest a
role for sPD-L1 in the pathogenesis of MM and offer new
insight into potential therapeutic strategies.

Soluble PD-L1 was measured using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (PDCD1LG1 ELISA kit, USCN
Life Science, catalogue: SEA788Hu) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The minimum detectable
concentration of sPD-L1 was 0.057 ng/ml. Each sample
was analyzed in duplicate. The intra-assay and inter-assay
coefficients of variation were below 20 percent.

Statistical analysis

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
analysis was performed to determine the best cut-off value
for sPD-L1 concentration that would classify patients as
having a high risk of disease progression (using SPSS
version 19 statistical software). In this ROC curve, the
point with the maximum sensitivity and specificity was
selected as the cut-off value. Correlations between sPD-L1
concentration and various clinicopathologic parameters
were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U-test or the
Wilcoxon-matched test, and a chi-squared test or Fisher’s
exact test was used for categorical values. Progressionfree survival (PFS) was the time between the date of
diagnosis and the date of disease progression or death and
was determined at last follow-up visit. Overall survival
(OS) was the time between the date of diagnosis and
date of death from any cause and was determined at the
last follow-up visit. PFS and OS were calculated by the
Kaplan–Meier method, while a log-rank test was used for
comparison. The prognostic factors of OS and PFS were
analyzed by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis was
performed using the Cox proportional hazard model to
compare significant factors from the univariate analysis.
Hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated
for all variables in the regression model. A two-sided
p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
SPSS version 19 statistical software was utilized.

Patients
A total of 81 patients with symptomatic multiple
myeloma were enrolled in our study, and all patients
were treated in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center
between January 2008 and December 2014. The inclusion
criteria were as follows: (1) de novo symptomatic multiple
myeloma; (2) patients were given at least 4 cycles of
chemotherapy; (3) serum at diagnosis was available; (4)
complete follow-up information. Sun Yat-sen University
Cancer Center Research Ethics Board approved use of
the data in this study, and written informed consent for
use and publication of patients’ medical information was
obtained from all patients at their first visit.

Treatments and response evaluation
According to the patients’ economic situation,
novel drug-based (mainly bortezomib) or older drugbased (mainly anthracylines or melphalan) regimens
were used (because bortezomib and lenalidomide are
not covered by Chinese medical insurance). In total,
55 patients received older drug regimens, such as VAD
(vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone) [29], DVD
(doxil, vincristine, and dexamethasone) [29], and MP
(melphalan and prednisone) [30]; 26 patients received
novel drug regimens, such as VD (bortezomib and
dexamethasone) [31], PAD (bortezomib, adriamycin, and
dexamethasone) [28], VTD (bortezomib, thalidomide,
and dexamethasone), and CyBorD (cyclophosphamide,
bortezomib, and dexamethasone) [32]. Patients were given
at least 4 cycles of treatment, followed by autologous
stem cell transplantation (if eligible) or maintenance
with thalidomide. Treatment responses were evaluated
after each cycle according to the International Myeloma
Working Group (IMWG) criteria [33].
