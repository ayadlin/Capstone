Abstract
VEGF antagonists are now widely used cancer therapeutics, but predictive biomarkers of response or toxicity
remain unavailable. In this study, we analyzed the effects of anti-VEGF therapy on tumor metabolism and
therapeutic response by using an integrated set of imaging techniques, including bioluminescence metabolic
imaging, 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, and MRI imaging and spectroscopy. Our results
revealed that anti-VEGF therapy caused a dramatic depletion of glucose and an exhaustion of ATP levels in
tumors, although glucose uptake was maintained. These metabolic changes selectively accompanied
the presence of large necrotic areas and partial tumor regression in highly glycolytic tumors. In addition,
we found that the central metabolic protein kinase AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)—a cellular sensor of
ATP levels that supports cell viability in response to energy stress—was activated by anti-VEGF therapy in
experimental tumors. AMPK-a2 attenuation increased glucose consumption, tumor cell sensitivity to glucose
starvation, and tumor necrosis following anti-VEGF therapy. Taken together, our findings reveal functional links
between the Warburg effect and the AMPK pathway with therapeutic responses to VEGF neutralization in tumor
xenograft models. Cancer Res; 71(12); 4214–25. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Tumor vascular targeting has been validated as a therapeutic concept with the approval of several drugs that block
the VEGF–VEGF receptor (VEGFR) pathway (1, 2). However,
both preclinical models and clinical trials have shown that
benefits from first-generation angiogenesis inhibitors are generally short-term, because of the development of intrinsic as
well as acquired resistance (3). A major challenge in the field is
therefore to identify biomarkers of efficacy and toxicity that

guide the selection of patients who are most likely to benefit
from treatment (4, 5).
Various types of response to antiangiogenic drugs such as
sunitinib or bevacizumab have been observed in cancer
patients. In some cases, patients present a decrease in tumor
volume by more than 33%, qualifying them as partial responders according to RECIST criteria. In other patients, however,
significant changes are observed only in tumor density with no
decrease in size. This is often associated with central tumor
cavitation and necrosis (6). Although this clinical observation
suggests that antiangiogenic therapy may cause severe energy
imbalance in certain tumors, it is currently unknown whether
molecular or metabolic features of tumor cells could be
involved in the type of pathologic response to VEGF-targeting
drugs or could predict efficacy. Preclinical models may help to
solve these issues.
In experimental tumors, anti-VEGF drugs typically prune
the newly formed vasculature, thus reducing microvessel
density (MVD), blood flow and perfusion, and eventually
increasing the level of intratumoral hypoxia (7–9). Although
in patients mechanisms might be more complex, considering that VEGF neutralization has therapeutic efficacy mainly
when combined with conventional chemotherapy (10), it is
currently held that following an initial time window of
"vascular normalization," regression of tumor vasculature
occurs leading to increased hypoxia (11). Less well understood is whether hypoxia eventually leads to tumor starvation. On one hand, hypoxia can exert both antiproliferative
effects or induce cancer cell death depending on specific

genetic features of tumor cells (12–14). On the other
hand, hypoxia can also favor invasion and metastasis, as
an evasive mechanism to antiangiogenic therapy (reviewed
in ref. 15).
Although it is usually granted that antiangiogenic drugs cut
oxygen supply into tumors, surprisingly less is known about
other metabolic perturbations induced by VEGF blockade in
the tumor microenvironment.
In a previous study, we identified ovarian cancer cells
endowed with different glycolytic phenotypes and correlated
this feature with resistance or sensitivity to severe hypoxia in
vitro (12). The great variations in glucose demand that we
observed in these tumor cell lines possibly reflect their genetic
heterogeneity and, importantly, this has also been observed in
patients affected by the same tumor type, mainly by 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography
(PET; refs. 16, 17).
Xenografts obtained from these cells have been analyzed
here to investigate the effects of VEGF neutralization on
glucose metabolism by using, for the first time, an integrated
imaging approach which included metabolic bioluminescence
imaging, FDG PET, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(MRS) analysis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments
IGROV-1 cells were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection; OC316 cells were provided by S. Ferrini (IST,
Genoa, Italy). The human esophageal cancer cell line Kyse30 (squamous cell carcinoma) and OE19 (adenocarcinoma)
were purchased from European Collection of Animal Cell
Cultures and used within 6 months from resuscitation.
Kyse-30 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 þ Ham's F12 medium
(1:1) with 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 2 mmol/L glutamine.
All other tumor cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium
(Euroclone) supplemented with 10% FCS (Life Technologies),
1% HEPES (10 mmol/L, Cambrex Bioscience), L-glutamine 2
mmol/L, and 1% antibiotics–antimycotic mix (Gibco-BRL).
Cultures were maintained at 37 C in a humidified 5% CO2/95%
air atmosphere. Where specified, IGROV-1 and OC316
cells were treated with 2-deoxyglucose (2DG; Sigma-Aldrich)
at 6 g/L for 72 hours before apoptosis evaluation. To induce
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway activation,
tumor cells were stimulated with AICAR or Metformin
(Sigma-Aldrich) at different concentrations for 24 hours
before protein analysis. Hypoxic treatment (0.5% O2) was
achieved by incubating cells in an InVivo2 300 hypoxic chamber (Ruskinn Technology).
Animals and treatments
Procedures involving animals and their care conformed
with institutional guidelines that comply with national and
international laws and policies (EEC Council Directive 86/
609, OJ L 358, 12 December, 1987). For tumor establishment,
8-week-old severe combined immunodeficient mice (SCID)
mice (Charles River) were injected s.c. into both flanks with
0.3  106 to 0.5  106 tumor cells mixed at 4 C with liquid

Matrigel (Becton-Dickinson). Tumor volume (mm3) was
calculated as previously reported (12). Anti-human VEGF
monoclonal antibody (mAb; A4.6.1) was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) at 100 mg/dose every 2 days, and mice were
sacrificed 48 hours after the third treatment. Control mice
received i.p. injections of PBS.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Quantification of necrosis was carried out by calculating the
percentage of the necrotic area in the entire tumor section by
using a light microscope equipped with digital camera and
MODEL software (Leica Microsystems). pAMPK monoclonal
(1:300 dilution, #2535S) and pACC polyclonal (1:400 dilution,
#3661S) antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology were used
for immunohistochemistry. Scoring of pAMPK or pACC
expression was done by an experienced pathologist (G.E.)
at a magnification of 100, on the basis of the Quick Score
Method (18). Immunoreactivity was scored semiquantitatively
for both the intensity and the proportion of cells staining:
intensity was given scores 0 to 3 (no staining ¼ 0, light staining
¼ 1, moderate staining ¼ 2, and strong staining ¼ 3) and
proportion was given scores 1 to 6 (0%–4% ¼ 1, 5%–20% ¼ 2,
21%–40% ¼ 3, 41%–60% ¼ 4, 61%–80% ¼ 5, and 81%–100% ¼
6). The 2 scores were multiplied to obtain the final result of 0
to 18. In evaluation of pACC staining in RIP-Tag2 tumor
sections, because of immunodetection heterogeneity among
samples, the intensity of the normal tissue in each tissue
section was taken as a reference to determine positivity/
negativity of each tumor (total n ¼ 116) from 4 animals
per treatment group. The percentage of positive tumors in
each animal was calculated and graphed as average and SD in
each treatment group. Mann–Whitney statistical test was
used to determine significance P < 0.05.
Evaluation of MVD and hypoxic areas
Tumor vessels were labeled with rat anti-CD31 mAb (1:50
dilution; Becton-Dickinson) followed by staining with a goat
anti-rat 546 secondary antibody (Invitrogen) and quantification of MVD as detailed elsewhere (12). To identify hypoxic
areas in tumors, we used pimonidazole hydrochloride (Hypoxyprobe-1; Chemicon International; ref. 12).
MRI/MRS analysis
Subcutaneous xenografts derived from IGROV-1 and OC316
cells were characterized by MRI and quantitative MRS. Experiments were conducted on a Varian INOVA MRI/MRS system
operating on small animals at 4.7 T (Varian) equipped with a
transmitter volume RF coil actively decoupled from the receiver surface coil (RAPID Biomedical). Further details can be
found in the Supplementary Data.
Metabolic bioluminescence imaging
Excised tumors were cut into serial cryosections for structural hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and bioluminescence measurements. For quantitative measurement of ATP
and glucose, the method of metabolic imaging with induced
bioluminescence was applied (19, 20). Further details can be
found in the Supplementary Data.

Animal PET studies
For m-PET measurements, tumors were implanted on the
back of the thorax. Imaging was done when tumors reached a
volume of 100 to 900 mL. On the day of PET measurement,
animals were anaesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and
placed in prone position. The m-PET imaging was done on
a microPET Focus 120 small animal PET (Siemens/Concorde).
After a 15 minutes transmission scan with an external 57Co
source, dynamic PET studies were acquired in two-dimensional mode. 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) with an activity of 5.6  0.2 MBq per animal was administered as a bolus
injection of 0.2 mL via the tail vein. Time–activity curves were
obtained with varying time frames (20s to 5 minutes) for a
total measuring interval of 30 minutes. The PET listmode data
were histogrammed into 13 frames and reconstructed by
using OSEM algorithm. Volumes of interests were defined
for the whole tumor, for necrotic areas of the tumor, and for
reference tissue (soft tissue of the neck region). Ratios of vital
tumor tissue (without necrosis) to reference tissue were
calculated from integral image between 10 and 30 minutes
after tracer injection.
Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as mean value  SD. Statistical
comparison between 2 sets of data was done by using either
the unpaired Student's t test (2-tailed) or the Mann–Whitney
test (2-tailed), depending on the distribution of values.
Differences were considered statistically significant at
P < 0.05.
Further experimental details are available in the Supplementary Data.

Results
Identification of tumor cells and xenografts with
different metabolic features
On the basis of measurements of glucose consumption and
lactate production rates in vitro as well as expression levels of
glycolysis-associated genes, we recently identified OC316 and
IGROV-1 cells as prototypes of highly and poorly glycolytic
ovarian cancer cells, respectively (12). Interestingly, viability of
OC316 but not of IGROV-1 cells was compromised under
hypoxic conditions and glucose supplementation prevented
cell death (12), thus suggesting that OC316 cells could be more
dependent on glucose as energy substrate than IGROV-1 cells.
To further validate this hypothesis, we measured cell viability
following incubation under glucose starvation or with 2DG, an
analog of glucose that binds and suppresses the glycolytic
enzyme hexokinase II (21), and found reduced survival of
OC316 cells compared with IGROV-1 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). Altogether, these results indicate that highly glycolytic OC316 cells are less able to cope with glucose deprivation
than poorly glycolytic IGROV-1 cells. These metabolic features
were further characterized by high resolution MRS, which
showed higher intracellular concentration of lactate (Lac) in
OC316 compared with IGROV-1 cells, as well as differences in
the pool of glutamate and glutamine (Glx; Supplementary
Fig. S1B).

To determine whether these metabolic differences were
conserved in vivo, we generated s.c. xenografts and characterized them by MRI and MRS. MRI can identify regions of
necrosis or hemorrhage as hyperintense or hypointense areas,
respectively, in the T2-weighted images. MRI revealed differences in tumor morphology and internal composition during
growth between the 2 models: OC316 tumors were characterized by a prominent central necrotic core, whereas IGROV-1
tumors had several small and diffuse necrotic areas (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Following MRS analysis, lactate was
observed in all OC316 tumors (n ¼ 3) and in 50% of the
IGROV-1 xenografts analyzed (n ¼ 4). Mean lactate concentrations were 38.2  8.3 mmol/L in OC316 tumors and 1.6 
0.1 mmol/L in IGROV-1 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
Finally, quantitative PCR analysis indicated higher expression
levels of GAPDH, HKII, and LHDA in OC316 compared with
IGROV-1 tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1E). In summary, these
findings indicate that OC316 and IGROV-1 are prototypes of
tumors with markedly different glycolytic phenotypes.
Outcome of anti-VEGF therapy in tumors with different
metabolic properties
We subsequently treated OC316 and IGROV-1 xenografts
with A4.6.1, a human VEGF neutralizing mAb bearing the
same CDR region as bevacizumab (22). A significant reduction
in tumor size was observed in OC316 but not in IGROV-1
tumors after 6 days of treatment (Fig. 1A). As expected, MVD
was significantly reduced after anti-VEGF treatment in all
tumors (Fig. 1B) and this was associated with a marked
increase in hypoxic areas, as shown by quantification of
pimonidazole adducts (Fig. 1C), and hypoxia inducible factor
(HIF)-1a levels (Supplementary Fig. S2). Histologic analysis
showed large necrotic areas within OC316 tumors treated with
A4.6.1, whereas minimal changes were measured in IGROV-1
tumors (Fig. 1D). This association between glycolytic phenotype and type of pathologic response to anti-VEGF therapy
was not unique to the OC316/IGROV-1 pair. In fact, similar
results were also seen after A4.6.1 administration to mice
bearing Kyse-30 and OE19-derived tumors, formed by highly
glycolytic and poorly glycolytic esophageal cancer cells,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3).
The effects of VEGF neutralization in tumors were further
documented by MRI techniques. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value is often correlated with tumor cellularity, and
in experimental tumors, an elevated ADC value has been correlated with the necrotic fraction (23). Quantitative MRI analysis
showed ADC values of 8.0  3.8 and 7.3  104  4.1  104
mm2/s (mean  SD) for the OC316 and IGROV-1 xenografts,
respectively, which were in good agreement with those recently
measured in patients with ovarian carcinoma (24). Short-course
anti-VEGF treatment was associated with changes in spectral
profiles and ADC distributions. Treated OC316 tumors had a
higher necrotic fraction compared with controls, as determined
by an increase in ADC mean value (9.0  4.3), because of an
increase in the right wing of the ADC distribution (Fig. 2A).
Differences in the spectral profile were also found, which could
reflect changes in tumor environment (i.e., pH) and/or altered
metabolism (Fig. 2B). The identity of these alterations remains

so far unknown. Twenty-four hours after the end of treatment,
lactate was detected in all tumors (3/3, 48  6 mmol/L). On the
other hand, treated IGROV-1 xenografts did not show any
difference in the spectral profile with respect to untreated
controls, whereas ADC distribution revealed a shift towards
lower values in the treated group suggesting the presence of cell
swelling (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Metabolic effects of anti-VEGF therapy
The large necrotic areas found in A4.6.1-treated OC316
xenografts suggested that acute VEGF neutralization caused
bioenergetic perturbations. To investigate this, we carried out
bioluminescence-based metabolic imaging of tumors, a technique which enables to visualize and measure steady-state
levels of specific metabolites. Results shown in Figure 3A
indicate a dramatic drop in glucose levels in OC316 xenografts
following A4.6.1 administration compared with controls
(1.36  0.61 mmol/g vs. 3.36  1.48 mmol/g). IGROV-1 tumors
also disclosed significant reduction in glucose levels after
treatment, albeit less intense compared with OC316 xeno-

Moreover, ATP levels were also markedly reduced after A4.6.1
treatment, both in OC316 and IGROV-1 tumors (Fig. 3C).
These findings show profound changes in glucose metabolism
following acute VEGF neutralization in tumors.
Impact of anti-VEGF treatment on FDG uptake
PET imaging of OC316 tumors distinctly showed areas of
reduced FDG uptake in the tumor center (Fig. 4A). These
regions correspond to tissue necrosis found at MRI analysis
and in H&E-stained tissue sections (Supplementary Fig. S1).
For statistical analysis, these necrotic regions have not been
taken into account. In IGROV-1 tumors, a rather homogeneous uptake was found (Fig. 4A). In these samples, FDG
uptake normalized to the viable tumor volume was independent from anti-VEGF treatment as shown by the time–activity
curves (Fig. 4B). The mean relative FDG uptake in the time
interval from 10 to 30 minutes after tracer injection was 173 
12% in A4.6.1-treated mice and 175  12% in control tumors

mean activity between 10 and 30 minutes was 191  11%
(A4.6.1 treated) versus 150  8% (control; P < 0.01). Altogether,
these results indicate that glucose uptake is not compromised
by anti-VEGF therapy, suggesting that the low glucose levels
measured in tumors by bioluminescence-based metabolic
imaging might depend on accelerated glucose consumption
rather than impaired delivery.

VEGF-targeting drugs induce AMPK activation in
experimental tumors
AMPK is a cellular sensor that contributes to maintain the
steady-state level of intracellular ATP (25). Because anti-VEGF
treatment lowered both glucose and ATP in vivo (Fig. 3), we
hypothesized that it might activate the AMPK pathway.
Staining with an anti-pAMPK Ab disclosed variable AMPK
activation in A4.6.1-treated tumors, showing much more
intense expression of pAMPK in IGROV-1 compared with

OC316 tumors (Fig. 5A). Phosphorylation of acetyl-coenzyme
A carboxylase (ACC), a key target of AMPK (26), was strongly
increased in IGROV-1 tumors treated with anti-VEGF, compared with controls (Fig. 5B). In line with results of antipAMPK staining, OC316 tumors had very weak pACC signal,
and this did not change in samples treated with anti-VEGF
mAb (Fig. 5B). Moreover, treatment of IGROV-1 xenografts
with vandetanib—an inhibitor of VEGFR, epidermal growth
factor receptor, and RET tyrosine kinases (reviewed in ref.
27)—markedly increased pACC staining, further validating
these findings (Fig. 5C).
Finally, strong pACC reactivity was also observed in RIPTag2 tumors treated either short or long term with DC101, an
anti-VEGFR Ab (28), compared with controls (Fig. 5D), indicating that increased AMPK activation can occur as a consequence of VEGF blockade also in transgenic tumor models.
To further investigate the possibility that the AMPK pathway could be disfunctional in OC316 cells, we measured AMPK
activation in cells incubated under hypoxic conditions and/or
glucose deprivation in vitro. Results indicate a raise in pAMPK
levels in IGROV-1 but not OC316 cells following cultivation in
the absence of glucose, both under normoxic and hypoxic
conditions (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Analysis of pACC levels
confirmed these findings, indicating strong ACC phosphorylation in IGROV-1 cells following glucose starvation, whereas
pACC was only slightly increased in OC316 cells under the
same experimental conditions (Supplementary Fig. S5A). To
corroborate these results, IGROV-1 and OC316 cells were
cultivated in the presence of canonical AMPK activators.
AICAR, a direct AMPK activator (26), was able to activate
AMPK in IGROV-1 but only barely in OC316 cells, as evaluated
by immunoblotting analysis of pAMPK levels (Supplementary
Fig. S5B). Similar results were obtained with Metformin, an
indirect AMPK activator (Supplementary Fig. S5C).
Because AMPK is activated by liver kinase B1 (LKB1; ref. 29),
we investigated expression levels of this kinase in tumor cells.
Results show that LKB1 is expressed at apparently similar
levels both in IGROV-1 and OC316 cells; in contrast, LKB1
was absent in HeLa cells, which are known to lack this kinase
(ref. 30; Supplementary Fig. S6A). Immunofluorescence analysis, however, disclosed that the pattern of LKB1 intracellular
staining was partially different in IGROV-1 compared with
OC316 cells. In fact, LKB1 was invariably detected both in the
cytoplasm and the nuclei of IGROV-1 cells, whereas 30.11 
8.68% OC316 cells lacked cytoplasmic staining (Supplementary
Fig. S6B). Sequencing of LKB1 disclosed a G > A variation at
nucleotide 958 of LKB1 exon 8 (Supplementary Fig. S6C), which
is predicted to introduce a valin to methionin change in a
domain of LKB1 putatively involved in the formation of the
multimeric complex of LKB1 with STRADa and MO25 (31).
Altogether, these findings indicate that the AMPK pathway is
disfunctional in OC316 cells, likely due to altered intracellular
distribution of its upstream activator LKB1.

IGROV-1 cells, which have a functional AMPK pathway.
Although IGROV-1 cells express both AMPKa1 and AMPKa2
isoforms, we tested the effects of AMPKa2 silencing, because
previous data showed the dominant role of this isoform in
determining the balance between proliferation and cell death
in ovarian cancer (32). Following transduction of 2 different
lentiviral vectors encoding AMPKa2-specific short-hairpin
RNA (shRNA), expression of AMPKa2 transcript was reduced
by 70% to 90% compared with control. Moreover, AMPKa1
expression was also attenuated by 20% to 40% (Fig. 6A).
Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of reduced
AMPK level in these cells (Fig. 6A), referred to here as
IGROV-1 shAMPKa2 cells. Proliferation (Supplementary
Fig. S7) and viability (Fig. 6B) of IGROV-1 shAMPKa2 cells
under standard culture conditions were similar to that of
control cells, transduced with a scramble shRNA vector.
However, glucose starvation was associated with significantly
higher death of IGROV-1 shAMPKa2 compared with control
cells (Fig. 6B). Intriguingly, attenuation of AMPKa2 was
followed by a marked increase in glucose consumption and
lactate production under normoxic conditions (Fig. 6C),

implying that AMPK levels modulate the glycolytic rate in
IGROV-1 cells.
In vivo, xenografts derived from IGROV-1 shAMPKa2 cells
developed at faster rates compared with controls (Fig. 6D).
Following treatment with A4.6.1, a significant increase in
necrosis was measured in tumors formed by IGROV-1
shAMPKa2 cells, whereas no difference was measured in
control tumors (Fig. 6D). Altogether, these findings show that
AMPK levels are critical to modulate the morphologic
responses of tumors to VEGF neutralization.

Discussion
Here, we investigated how metabolic parameters contribute
to determine the pathologic response to VEGF blockade in
tumor xenografts. A first conclusion is that the glycolytic rate
in cultured cell lines and their level of "glucose addiction" are
of paramount importance in determining the amount of
necrosis caused by angiogenesis inhibition. Although it is well
recognized that low glucose concentrations can be present in
large solid tumors because of their compromised vascular

Antiangiogenic Therapy and AMPK Activation

functions (20, 33), with regard to the effects of antiangiogenic
drugs, previous studies have mainly characterized changes in
hypoxia, assuming that glucose would remain available
because of its high diffusion capacity in tissues. Our metabolic
imaging results clearly showed that VEGF blockade acutely
perturbs glucose and ATP levels in xenografts. Because in PET
experiments FDG uptake in A4.6.1-treated animals was either
the same (IGROV-1) or even higher (OC316) than in untreated
controls (Fig. 4B), glucose supply does not seem to be
impaired by short-term anti-VEGF treatment. The higher
FDG uptake into A4.6.1-treated OC316 tumors may be the
result of either a higher glucose consumption rate or the
induction of GLUT transporters which facilitate cellular
uptake. Both mechanisms may depend from hypoxia-induced
HIF-1a accumulation, which was indeed detected in A4.6.1treated tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2). Although PET findings may seem to contradict those of bioluminescence-based
metabolic imaging, it should be stressed that one method
measures glucose uptake and the other steady-state levels.
Therefore, it is possible that glucose consumption in antiVEGF–treated animals exceeds the increased glucose uptake,
resulting in lower steady-state levels of this metabolite.
Metabolic imaging also showed that anti-VEGF treatment
caused similar drops in mean ATP levels in OC316 and IGROV1 xenografts. Therefore, quantitative variations in ATP levels
are not likely to account for the different levels of necrosis
detected in OC316 versus IGROV-1 xenografts.
A second key finding of the study is the demonstration that
VEGF blockade increased AMPK activation in tumors, as
shown by immunohistochemistry analysis of pAMPK and
pACC levels, both in xenografts of ovarian cancer cells treated
with 2 different angiogenesis inhibitors and in spontaneous
tumors arising in RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice (Fig. 5). AMPK is a
central metabolic switch found in all eukaryotes that governs
glucose and lipid metabolism in response to alterations in
nutrients and intracellular energy levels, as well as cell polarity
(29). The serine–threonine kinase LKB1, a known tumor
suppressor, is a key upstream activator of AMPK (29). Because
AMPK is activated when intracellular levels of ATP decline
and intracellular levels of AMP increase, such as during
nutrient deprivation and hypoxia, a certain level of AMPK
activation is commonly seen in solid tumors (34), and we also
observed this in the perinecrotic areas of our control xenografts (Fig. 5). In our study, however, hypoxia did not activate
AMPK in vitro unless tumor cells were grown under glucose
starvation (Supplementary Fig. S5). Therefore, AMPK activation after VEGF blockade is not likely to depend directly on
hypoxia but, rather, on the low glucose and ATP levels
detected in tumors. Indeed, AMPK activation fits nicely with
the results of bioluminescence imaging. AMPK deficiency
promotes apoptosis in culture following treatment with
energy stress-inducing agents (30, 35), probably because cells
cannot restore ATP levels. It is thus possible that defects of
AMPK activation may in part account for the reduced
survival of OC316 cells under glucose starvation or 2DG
treatment in vitro, as well as after antiangiogenic therapy in
vivo. The finding of a V320M variation in the LKB1 domain
involved in interaction with STRADa (31) might affect LKB1

www.aacrjournals.org

trafficking and could putatively explain the predominantly
nuclear localization of LKB1 in these cells, as well as its
reduced activity (36). Importantly, attenuation of AMPKa2
in IGROV-1 cells was sufficient to modulate their survival
under glucose starvation in vitro and to increase the level of
necrosis in xenografts treated with the anti-VEGF mAb, thus
lending support to this hypothesis.
We also noticed that AMPKa2 attenuation increased glucose consumption and lactate production by IGROV-1 cells,
thus contributing to the Warburg effect. It was previously
known that HIF1a and its target genes are upregulated in
LKB1-, AMPK-, and TSC-deficient fibroblasts, indicating that
loss of any of these genes is sufficient to alter cell metabolism
(37, 38). In IGROV-1 cells, HIF1a activity measured by a
luciferase-based reporter assay doubled following attenuation
of AMPKa2 levels by shRNA (Supplementary Fig. S8), suggesting that HIF1a could in part contribute to the modulation of
cell metabolism in this system. The observation that AMPK is
disfunctional in OC316 cells may also in part explain their
increased glycolytic phenotype compared with IGROV-1 cells,
although we are aware that also other signaling pathways
disregulated in cancer—including c-myc, KRAS, Akt, and
p53—may regulate glucose metabolism (39). In this regard,
it is important to stress that Akt phosphorylation at residues
ser473 and thr308 was lower in OC316 compared with IGROV1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S9). Thus, although it has been
reported that cells with high Akt activity do not activate
AMPK efficiently (40), this mechanism is not likely involved
in OC316 cells.
This study clearly has translational implications both for
ovarian cancer and other malignancies. Bevacizumab has
therapeutic activity in ovarian cancer also as single agent
(41, 42) and 2 large-phase III clinical trials (GOG-218 and
ICON7) are undergoing to establish whether it improves
efficacy of standard chemotherapy (43, 44). Our findings are
potentially important for several reasons: First, they identify
both AMPK activation and the glycolytic phenotype of tumors
as novel biomarkers of pathologic response to anti-VEGF
therapy, although further work will be required to validate
these concepts and to determine their predictive value in
patients. Second, our findings may offer an interpretation of
the molecular mechanisms underlying certain toxic effects of
VEGF blockade, including GI perforations and bleeding. GI
perforations have been reported in as high as 11.4% of patients
with metastatic ovarian cancer treated with bevacizumab (42)
and occur more frequently in subjects with more advanced
stage disease showing tumor involvement of the intestinal
wall. Life-threatening bleeding has been reported in about
2.3% to 10% of patients with metastatic non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy
and squamous histology and tumor cavitation before or
during bevacizumab treatment remain the only known risk
factors (45). It will be important to test whether highly
glycolytic tumors or tumors bearing defects in LKB1/AMPK
are associated with these serious side effects, particularly in
NSCLC, in which LKB1 mutations are common (46).
Finally, our study has highlighted the potential of MRI/MRS
analysis for noninvasive metabolic characterization of tumors,

which is important because it is generally difficult to obtain
biopsies from cancer patients subjected to antiangiogenic
therapy. The MRS approach adopted in this work, although
liable to overestimation because of possible residual lipid
contamination, has already been applied to tumors in patients
(47). In vivo detection of lactate levels and alterations following
anti-VEGF treatment by MRS in combination with MRI could
represent noninvasive tools to identify "glucose addicted"
tumors and correlate this with AMPK function and clinical
responses to bevacizumab and other antiangiogenic drugs.
