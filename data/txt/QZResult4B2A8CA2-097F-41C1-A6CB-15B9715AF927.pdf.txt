ABSTRACT
Second-hand smoke (SHS) is associated with 20–30% of cigarette-smoke related
diseases, including cancer. Majority of SHS (>80%) originates from side-stream
smoke (SSS). Compared to mainstream smoke, SSS contains more tumorigenic
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and acrolein (Acr). We assessed SSS-induced
benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE)- and cyclic propano-deoxyguanosine (PdG)
adducts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung, heart, liver, and bladder-mucosa
from mice exposed to SSS for 16 weeks. In SSS exposed mice, Acr-dG adducts were
the major type of PdG adducts formed in BAL (p < 0.001), lung (p < 0.05), and
bladder mucosa (p < 0.001), with no significant accumulation of Acr-dG adducts
in heart or liver. SSS exposure did not enhance BPDE-DNA adduct formation in any
of these tissues. SSS exposure reduced nucleotide excision repair (p < 0.01) and
base excision repair (p < 0.001) in lung tissue. The levels of DNA repair proteins,
XPC and hOGG1, in lung tissues of exposed mice were significantly (p < 0.001 and
p < 0.05) lower than the levels in lung tissues of control mice. We found that Acr can
transform human bronchial epithelial and urothelial cells in vitro. We propose that
induction of mutagenic Acr-DNA adducts, inhibition of DNA repair, and induction of cell
transformation are three mechanisms by which SHS induces lung and bladder cancers.

importance of establishing CS-free environments in order
to reduce human cancer.
More than 80% of SHS originates from side stream
smoke (SSS) [13]. Many studies have found that on a
per total particulate matter basis, SSS is two- to five-fold
more toxic and mutagenic than mainstream smoke (MSS)
[13–15]. The underlying mechanisms of what causes SSS
to be more toxic and mutagenic than MSS are unclear.
Compared with MSS, SSS contains more polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and aldehydes, such

INTRODUCTION
Cigarette smoke (CS) is the major cause of human
cancer, with more than 5 million CS-related cancer
deaths worldwide annually [1]. Numerous studies have
unambiguously established the relationship between
mainstream smoke (MSS) and human cancer [2–7]. Many
epidemiology studies suggest that second hand smoke
(SHS) is responsible for 20–30% of CS related diseases,
including cancer [7–12]. These findings underscore the

acrolein (Acr), formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde [13, 15].
Metabolically activated PAHs can induce mutagenic DNA
damage [16, 17]. Acr can both induce mutagenic DNA
adducts and modify repair proteins, causing DNA repair
dysfunction and degradation [18–21]. Acr also enhances
the susceptibility of cells to mutagenesis [18, 20, 21].
These findings raise the possibility that induction of DNA
damage by PAHs and Acr and inhibition of DNA repair
by Acr are two mechanisms by which SSS causes toxic,
mutagenic, and perhaps tumorigenic effects. We tested this
possibility by determining the levels of two major classes
of DNA adduct induced by PAHs and aldehydes: benzo(a)
pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE)-DNA adducts and aldehydeinduced cyclic propano-deoxyguanosine (PdG) adducts
in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung, heart, liver, and
bladder-mucosa tissues from mice exposed to SSS for
8 and 16 weeks. We also determined the effect of SSS
on nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision
repair (BER) in lung tissues, as well as the effect of Acr
on tumorigenic cell transformation activity in human
bronchial epithelial and urothelial cells. We found that
SSS induced mutagenic Acr-DNA adducts and inhibited
DNA repair. Acr also induced cell transformation in vitro.
We propose that these are the three mechanisms by which
SHS causes lung and bladder cancers.

[16–18, 20, 29]. Benzo(a)pyrene (BP) is one of the most
mutagenic and tumorigenic PAHs found in CS [30–32].
BP induces mainly BPDE-DNA adducts in both cultured
human cells and animal models [33–37]. The major DNA
adducts induced by Acr are γ-OH-1,N2-propano-dG (AcrdG) adducts, which have been found to be as mutagenic
as BPDE-DNA adducts [21, 29, 38, 39]. The distribution
of DNA adducts induced by these two compounds in the
p53 gene of human bronchial epithelial cells are similar,
if not identical, to the p53 mutational spectrum in human
lung cancer [19, 40, 41]. These two compounds have been
proposed to be important human lung cancer etiological
agents in CS and cooking fumes [19, 21, 40, 42]. For these
reasons we determined the levels of BPDE- and Acr-DNA
adducts in the BAL, lung, bladder-mucosa, heart, and
liver of mice exposed to SSS and FA. Acr-DNA adducts
in the genomic DNA isolated from lung tissues were first
determined by the well-established 2D-TLC and HPLC
analysis method [18–21]; this method is able to determine
the cyclic propano-dG induced by Acr, acetaldehyde
(Acet), crotonaldehyde (Cro), and 4-hydroxy-2′-nonenal
(HNE), which are abundant in CS [21, 25, 43–45]. The
results in Fig. 1A show that the major cyclic propano-dG
adducts (PdGs) formed in lung of mice exposed to SSS
for 16 weeks co-chromatographed with Acr-dG adducts.
DNA adducts formed in lung tissues of mice exposed
to SSS also reacted with a monoclonal antibody against
Acr-dG adducts (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we conclude that
SSS exposure induces Acr-dG adducts. These results are
consistent with the finding that Acr is a major aldehyde
in SSS [13, 46]. Both the 2D-TLC/HPLC and the
immunochemical method yielded similar, nearly identical,
results (Fig. 1C and 1D).
Owing to the very limited amount of genomic DNA
(<1 μg) isolated from the BAL and bladder mucosa for
each mouse, the Acr-dG adduct levels in these tissues were
assessed only by the immunochemical method, using the
monoclonal antibody against Acr-dG adducts [20, 29].
Fig. 2A shows that exposure to SSS affects the Acr-dG
levels in the BAL, lung, and bladder mucosa, but not the
liver or heart of mice. Although Acr-dG levels in the BAL,
lung, and bladder mucosa in mice exposed to SSS or FA
for 8 weeks were not significantly different (p = 0.49,
p = 0.44 and p = 0.07 respectively), Acr-dG levels in the
BAL, lung, and bladder mucosa in mice exposed to SSS
for 16 weeks were twice those from mice exposed to FA.
In contrast, Acr-dG levels in liver and heart tissues were
the same for mice exposed to SSS and FA for 16 weeks.

RESULTS
Exposure of mice to SSS
SSS was generated from a smoke machine by
burning one cigarette at a time at a burning rate of one
cigarette per 12 min. The 500 μg/m3 of smoke particulate
matters generated in the SSS is roughly equivalent to the
smoke concentration in a household of a habitual heavy
smoker [22]. A total of 39 male mice (9–10 mice/group)
was either exposed to SSS or filtered air (FA) 6 h/day and
5 days/week for 8 and 16 weeks. At the end of exposure
mice were sacrificed, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)
was collected, and lung, heart, liver, and bladder-mucosa
tissues were harvested and snap frozen at –80°C. For DNA
adduct analysis, genomic DNAs were prepared from the
BAL, lung, heart, liver, and mucosa of bladder tissues
[20]. For the DNA repair assay, cell lysates were prepared
from lung tissues of mice exposed to SSS or FA [18, 19,
23]. During the 8- and 16-week exposure period, all mice
appeared to be healthy (no weight lost, fur normal, and no
unusual behavior), and all the mice survived until after the
end of experimental period.

of BPDE-DNA adducts in the BAL, lung, liver, heart, and

mice exposed to SSS and to FA for 16 weeks (p = 0.32,
p = 0.1, p = 0.23, p = 0.98 and p = 0.1 respectively); 2) the
levels of BPDE-DNA adducts in the BAL, lung, bladdermucosa, liver, and heart are 20–40 fold lower than Acr-dG

that SSS can inhibit NER and BER in lung and bladder
tissues and enhance the susceptibility of the exposed cells
to mutagenesis. To test this possibility, we used an in vitro
DNA-dependent repair synthesis method to determine the
NER and BER activity in cell lysates isolated from lung
tissues of mice exposed to SSS and FA. It was not possible
to obtain adequate amounts of cell lysate from the bladdermucosa to conduct this assay. Results in Fig. 3A–3C show
that: 1) the activity of both NER and BER showed a wide
range in mice exposed to FA; 2) the variation of NER and
BER in 16-week-SSS-exposed mice were much smaller
than those in FA exposed mice; and 3) most importantly,
the NER and BER activity in lung tissues of mice exposed
to SSS for 8 and 16 weeks were lower than for their
counterparts of FA exposed mice, with the effect being
more profound in mice exposed for 16 weeks (p < 0.01
and p < 0.001 for NER and BER) than in mice exposed
for 8 weeks.

SSS exposure causes a reduction of NER and
BER capacity
The previous results indicate that Acr induces cyclic
PdG DNA adducts in the BAL, lung, and bladder-mucosa
of SSS-exposed mice. We have reported that Acr exposure
inhibits DNA repair, including nucleotide excision repair
(NER) and base excision repair (BER), in cultured
human bronchial epithelial cells and urothelial cells, and
consequently enhances the mutational susceptibility of the
exposed cells [18–20]. These results raise the possibility

autophagy-dependent DNA repair protein degradation in
cultured human bronchial epithelial cells and urothelial
cells [18, 20, 47]. Given both that Acr is a major component
of SSS and our demonstration that BAL, bladder-mucosa
and lung tissues of SSS-exposed mice have higher levels
of Acr-dG adducts than those exposed to FA, these results
raise the possibility that Acr in SSS can modify DNA repair
proteins, thereby causing the degradation of these proteins.
If this is the case, then we expect that the levels of some of
the NER and BER proteins in lung tissues in SSS-exposed
mice are lower than those in FA-exposed control mice.
Results in Figs. 4A and 4B show that the levels of XPC and
hOGG1 in lung tissues of mice exposed to SSS for 16 weeks
are substantially lower (p = 0.0002 and p = 0.02, for XPC
and hOGG1, respectively) than those of FA-exposed mice,
although 8 weeks of SSS exposure does not cause this effect.
XPC is a key NER component for genomic DNA overall
[48] and hOGG1 is a BER enzyme, which has glycosylase
and phosphodiesterase functions to repair 8-oxo-dG, a major
product of oxidative damage to DNA [49]

bladder- mucosa, and inhibits NER and BER and
reduces the levels of XPC and hOGG1 repair proteins
in lung tissues. These results suggest that Acr is a major
component in SSS responsible for inducing human lung
and bladder cancer. Although the mutagenicity of AcrdG has been established, the tumorigenicity of Acr has
not been unambiguously demonstrated in animal models
[21, 50, 51]. Although mice are extremely sensitive to
Acr exposure following inhalation, the mechanisms that
underlie the Acr lethality in mice remain unclear [52].
As a first step to establishing the tumorigenicity of Acr
in lung and bladder, we determined the ability of Acr
to induce anchorage-independent growth (a hallmark of
neoplastic cell transformation) of immortalized human
bronchial epithelial cells BEAS-2B and urothelial
cells UROtsa [53–55]. Cells were treated with Acr
(2.5 μM of Acr for 1 h at 37°C) and the effect of
Acr on cell anchorage-independent growth was then
assessed by growth in soft agar [53, 56]. The results
in Fig. 5 show that Acr treatment induced significant
anchorage-independent growth in both bronchial
epithelial cells (p < 0.01) and urothelial cells (p < 0.05).
These results indicate that Acr can cause tumorigenic
transformation in both human bronchial epithelial and
urothelial cells.

DISCUSSION

that tobacco carcinogens in children’s urines of smokers’
households [62–64]. The current study presents evidence
that SSS induces mutagenic Acr-dG adducts, inhibits DNA
repair, and causes degradation of DNA repair proteins.
We also show that Acr, the major aldehydes in SSS, can
induce tumorigenic cell transformation.
Although SSS is thought to be more toxic and
mutagenic than MSS, this conclusion is derived primarily
from results obtained using smoke that was collected from
SSS and stored [13, 26]. Given that chemical reactions
may occur during SSS condensation and storage, those
results might not reflect the effect of SSS immediately
after it is generated [13, 26]. To avoid this potential

Tobacco smoke is the major cause of human cancer;
this conclusion is mainly derived from smokers have
a higher cancer incidence than the general population,
that main stream smoke contains a variety of human
carcinogens, and that MSS causes cancer in animal
models [26, 57–60]. In contrast, although it is generally
believed that SHS is hazardous to human health, including
the induction of cancer, direct biochemical evidence of
SHS on carcinogenic mechanisms is lacking [61]. The
Clean Air Act that banned smoking in public settings, is
mainly based on epidemiological studies and the findings

complication, we used SSS generated in real-time to
address its actual effects on DNA adduct formation and
DNA repair capacity.
Both MSS and SSS contain many aldehydes,
including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, crotonaldehyde,
and Acr [26]. CS contains higher levels of acetaldehyde
and formaldehyde than Acr [26]; however, we found
that SSS induces mainly Acr-dG adducts, rather than
acetaldehyde- or crotonaldehyde-induced DNA adducts
in BAL, lung, and bladder mucosa of SSS-exposed mice
(Fig. 1). Acr differs from most aldehydes insofar as it can
be readily absorbed by human cells [19–21, 65]. Given
that the boiling temperature of acetaldehyde is much lower
than that of most aldehydes at ambient temperature [66],
the bioavailability of acetaldehyde is probably much lower
than that of other aldehydes. These factors together may
contribute to the fact that only Acr-induced DNA adducts
are observed in the BAL, lung, and bladder mucosa of
SSS-exposed mice.
It is intriguing that SSS inhalation causes an
increase in Acr-dG adduct formation in BAL, lung,
and bladder mucosa but not in heart and liver. Given
that respiratory organs are the main paths for inhaled
SSS, bronchial epithelial cells are exposed to more SSS
than cells in other organs. Glutathione in lung cells can
effectively conjugate with Acr and the conjugated Acr
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is then excreted [65]. Therefore, it is possible that once
the level of inhaled Acr overwhelms the level of cellular
glutathione, the unconjugated Acr may react with other
cellular components, including DNA, to form adducts.
This is probably the major reason that, when compared
with mice exposed to FA, levels of Acr-dG adducts in
BAL, lung, and bladder-tissues are significantly higher in
mice exposed to SSS for 16 weeks but not for 8 weeks.
We expect that once Acr enters into the bloodstream
it reacts quickly with proteins, and the protein- and
glutathione-conjugated Acr in the bloodstream are unable
to enter other organs, such as liver and heart. However,
the conjugation of Acr to proteins is reversed in the renal
system to free the Acr for excretion in the urine. It is likely
that the Acr in urine can damage the urothelial cells in
the urinary system [20, 21]. This explanation is in line
with well-established findings that the Acr generated by
metabolism of the antitumor drugs cyclophosphamide and
isophosphamide damages the lining of the urinary system,
causing blood in the urine [67, 68]
We do not observe any significant increase in
BPDE-DNA adduct levels in the BAL, lung, heart, liver,
or bladder mucosa in SSS-exposed mice. Given that the
amount of BP is 1,000- to 10,000-fold lower than the
amount of Acr in MSS, as well as in SSS, this low level
of BP may be effectively “neutralized“ by components in
33231

the lining of the respiratory system, thereby considerably
reducing the probability that it might damage bronchial
epithelial cells. It is worth noting that the levels of AcrdG adducts are >20 fold higher than the levels of BPDEdG adducts in all four organs of FA-exposed control
mice. Given that Acr is a byproduct of endogenous lipid
peroxidation, it is likely that the Acr-dG adducts in control
mice result from DNA damage induced by endogenously
generated Acr [69, 70].
It has been shown that Acr-dG adducts are
mutagenic, that Acr can modify repair proteins and cause
inhibition in NER, BER, and mismatch repair, and that Acr
treatment increases the susceptibility of human cells to
DNA-dependent mutagenesis [18, 20]. The current results
show that Acr can induce tumorigenic cell transformation
(Fig. 5). Previously, we reported that the distribution of
Acr-induced DNA adducts in the p53 gene in human
bronchial epithelial cells coincides with the lung cancer
p53 mutational spectrum [19]. Mutations in p53 is a major
step of lung carcinogenesis; more than 40% lung cancer
carry p53 mutations [31, 71]. Based on these findings we
propose that Acr is a major carcinogen in MSS and SSS.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in
Taiwanese women, even though only 5% of Taiwanese
women smoke [72, 73]. This high incidence of lung
cancer in Taiwanese women has been attributed to two
possible causes: exposure to second hand smoke and to
cooking fumes [73, 74]. More than 50% of Taiwanese
men smoke and women in households with smokers
have more than 1.8- (in childhood) and 2.2- (adult life)
fold higher incidence of lung cancer than those who live
in households without smokers [75, 76]. The cooking
fumes in Taiwan’s kitchens are rich in Acr [74]. Women
who live in households without fume extractors in the
kitchen have a 6–7 fold higher incidence of lung cancer
than women who live in houses with fume extractors
[74, 77]. Our results suggest that induction of mutagenic
Acr-dG adducts, inhibition of DNA repair, and an increase
of mutational susceptibility are the three mechanisms that
cause the higher incidence of lung cancer in Taiwanese
women.
In summary, we found that SSS induces mainly
mutagenic Acr-dG adducts in BAL, lung tissue, and
bladder mucosa. SSS also inhibits DNA repair, and causes
repair protein degradation in lung tissue. Since SSS is rich
in Acr and Acr also can cause the same effects as SSS
does, we propose that the Acr is a major component of
SSS that causes lung and bladder cancer.

5 days/week for 8 or 16 weeks. The cigarette smoke
(CS) was generated with an automated cigarette-smoking
machine (CH Technologies, Westwood, NJ), using 2R4F
cigarettes [Cigarette and Health Research Institute; stored
at 24°C and 60% relative humidity (RH)]. One cigarette
was lighted at a time to produce mainstream smoke (MSS)
with an automatically regulated piston pump using a twosecond puff of 35 ml volume once per minute. The SSS
produced from the cigarette was swept up and diluted by
FA and introduced into a 1.3-m3 stainless steel chamber
for animal exposure. Mice were exposed, whole body,
by inhalation, in their own cages, with food and water
removed during the 6-h daily exposure period. Control
mice were housed in identical exposure chambers using
the same chamber flow characteristics except that the
mice were exposed to charcoal-and-HEPA-filtered
air. The detail of SSS exposure method is the same as
described previously [78]. The average concentration of
SSS was 454 ± 120 μg/m3 for the 8-week exposure and
454 ± 110  μg/m3 for the 16-week exposure. It should
be noted that worldwide, in indoor environments where
people smoke, the mean levels of respirable suspended
particles range from 24 to 1,947 μg/m3 (IARC Mono
vol. 83). Mice were sacrificed 24 h after the last exposure.
BAL was collected by rinsing the lung with 1.2 ml of
phosphate buffered saline without calcium and magnesium
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) [79]. BAL was stored on ice
until analysis. The lung, heart, liver, and bladder were
collected and snap frozen at –80°C.

Genomic DNA and cell lysates preparation from
BAL, lung, heart, liver, and bladder-mucosa
For DNA adduct analysis, genomic DNAs were
prepared from BAL, lung, heart, liver, and bladder mucosa
as previously described [20]. For in vitro DNA repair
assay, cell lysates were prepared from lung tissues of mice
exposed to SSS and FA [19, 20, 23].

DNA adduct analysis
Cyclic propano-dG adducts that formed in the
genomic DNA isolated from BAL, lung, bladder-mucosa,
heart, and liver of mice exposed to FA and SSS for 8
and 16 weeks were analyzed by the immunochemical
methods previously described [18, 20]. PdG adduct
levels in lung tissues were also analyzed by the 32P postlabeling 2D-TLC/HPLC method [18–20]. In brief, 10 μg
of genomic DNA were digested with micrococcal nuclease
and spleen phosphodiesterase (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO, USA). Samples were then digested further with
nuclease NP1, and then labeled with 32P-γ-ATP. The
resultant monophosphate nucleotides were separated by
2D-TLC, the adducted spots were eluted and then further
analyzed by HPLC. The amount of adducted nucleotides
was calculated based on the 32P ratio of adducted DNA

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Exposure of mice to SSS
Male FVBN mice (8-week-old, Charles River,
n = 9–10/group/time point) were exposed to either
filtered air (FA) or side-stream smoke (SSS) for 6 h/day

adduct peak with the dGMP of known concentration
labeled with 32P-γ-ATP exactly the same as in the digested
genomic DNA. Given the small amount of mouse lung
tissue, lung tissues were pooled from three randomly
chosen mice from the same treatment group for a single
chemical analysis.

This research was supported by National Institutes
of Health Grants (CA165980, CA190678, ES00260, UO1
CA086137).

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

DNA repair activity and repair protein detection

The authors declare no conflict of interest.

The NER and BER activity in cell lysates isolated
from lung tissues was determined by the in vitro DNA
damage-dependent repair synthesis method, as described
previously [18–20]. In brief, pUC18 plasmid DNAs
were irradiated by UVC (1500 J/m2) or modified with
H2O2 (100 mM, 30 min at 37°C) and used as substrates
for determining the NER and BER activity, respectively.
Cell lysates were isolated from lung tissues of mice
exposed to FA and SSS. The assays were carried out
in a mixture of substrate DNA (pUC18) and control
DNA (undamaged pBR322), cell lysates, dCTP, dGTP,
dTTP and 32P-α-dATP. The mixtures were incubated
at 30°C for 3 h. The plasmid DNAs were purified and
then digested with restriction enzyme HindIII. The
resultant DNAs were separated by electrophoresis and
the amounts of repair synthesis were detected by the
radioautography. The DNA repair capacity was not
determined in bladder mucosa due to the fact that the
amount of cell lysates isolated from bladder mucosa was
insufficient to assay DNA repair in vitro. The method
to detect the repair proteins XPC and hOGG1 was
described previously [18, 20].
