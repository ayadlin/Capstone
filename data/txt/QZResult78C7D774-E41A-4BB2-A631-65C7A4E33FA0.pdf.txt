BACKGROUND. Preclinical evidence suggests that anticoagulants, in particular the
low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH), exert an antitumor effect, whereas clinical trials have reported conflicting results. The authors conducted a comprehensive, systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence from randomized
controlled trials (RCTs), to evaluate the impact of anticoagulants on survival and

safety in cancer patients without venous thromboembolism.

METHODS. A comprehensive systematic literature review of RCTs was performed
without language restrictions through May 2006 with subsequent updates to the
end of 2006, including an exhaustive search of electronic databases, major conference proceedings, article references, and content experts. Two reviewers
extracted data independently. Primary study outcomes were 1-year overall mor-

tality and all bleeding complications. Major and fatal bleeding complications
were secondary outcomes.

RESULTS. Across all 11 studies that were identified, anticoagulation significantly
decreased 1-year overall mortality with a relative risk (RR) of 0.905 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.847–0.967; P 5 .003). The RR for mortality was 0.877
(95% CI, 0.789–0.975; P 5 .015) for LMWH, compared with an RR of 0.942 (95%
CI, 0.854–1.040; P 5 .239) for warfarin, resulting in an absolute risk difference
(ARD) of 8% for LMWH and an ARD of 3% for warfarin. Improved survival with
anticoagulation may be dependent on tumor type. Major bleeding episodes
occurred less frequently in patients who received LMWH (ARD, 1%) compared
with patients who received warfarin (ARD, 11.5%; P < .0001). Overall, fatal bleeding occurred rarely (ARD, 0.32%; P 5 .542).

CONCLUSIONS. Anticoagulants, particularly LMWH, significantly improved overall
survival in cancer patients without venous thrombosis while increasing the risk
for bleeding complications. However, given the limitations of available data, the
use of anticoagulants as antineoplastic therapy cannot be recommended until
additional RCTs confirm these results. Cancer 2007;110:1149–60.  2007 American

venous thrombosis are at increased risk of subsequently developing cancer.11–14 Considerable experimental data indicate that anticoagulants, in
particular low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)
and unfractionated heparin (UFH), exert an antitumor effect.15–32
The antineoplastic effect of anticoagulation first
was evaluated clinically in the late 1960s and early
1970s with promising results, although the trials either were nonrandomized or had substantial methodological shortcomings.33–37 Zacharski et al. were the
first to perform a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
that studied the impact of warfarin on survival in
several different cancer types, including cancers of
the lung, colon, head and neck, and prostate. Their
reports indicated an improvement in overall survival
only in patients with small cell lung cancer
(SCLC).38,39 Results from the subsequent Cancer and
Leukemia Group B study evaluating warfarin versus
no warfarin therapy in patients with SCLC indicated
that warfarin significantly increased the complete
and partial response rates (P 5 .012) with a borderline improvement in failure-free survival (P 5 .054)
but did not reach statistical significance for overall
survival (P 5 .098).40 A subsequent venous thrombosis prevention study, in which patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to receive
either warfarin or placebo, demonstrated a significant reduction of venous thromboembolism without
a substantial improvement in the secondary survival
outcome.41 A follow-up warfarin study in patients
with SCLC produced mixed results42; however, both
subsequent studies with UFH and LMWH reported
significant improvements in overall survival.43,44
Available meta-analyses investigating the effect
of anticoagulation on mortality in patients without a
diagnosis of venous thrombosis either included noncancer patients, analyzed nonrandomized cohort
reports and post-hoc subgroup analyses of cancer
patients from trials that were performed in general
medical patients, or included studies investigating
a combination of anticoagulants.45–47 In addition,
these meta-analyses were largely not based on a
comprehensive, systematic review; researched only 1
type of anticoagulant; provided little or no bleeding
information; and preceded recent trials.48–52 The
objective of the current analysis was to perform a
comprehensive, systematic review and meta-analysis
of the evidence from RCTs on the efficacy and safety
of anticoagulants, including LMWH, UFH, and vitamin K antagonists, as treatment in cancer patients
without venous thromboembolism by assessing the
effect of these drugs on survival and bleeding complications.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Literature Search
An exhaustive, systematic literature review of RCTs
that examined the influence of anticoagulant therapy
on survival and bleeding complications in cancer
patients was performed. The comprehensive search
included the following electronic databases through
May 2006 with subsequent weekly updates to the
end of 2006: Medline (including Cancerlit), EMBASE,
the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the
Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect, and the
National Guidelines Clearing House and Conference
Proceedings (American Society of Clinical Oncology,
American Society of Hematology, and International
Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis). References
from included articles, relevant excluded reports, and
guidelines were searched by hand. In addition, content experts from the Venous Thrombosis Guideline
Committee of the American Society of Clinical Oncology were asked to review the list of identified articles for completeness. Subject headings and
keywords used in the search process included four
major categories including medical subject headings
and text words: 1) survival, including death and mortality; 2) all types of malignancies, including solid
tumors and hematologic malignancies; 3) anticoagulation, including vitamin K antagonists, UFH and
LMWH; and 4) RCTs. The recommended search strategy from the Cochrane Collaboration was used.53,54
These 4 major search categories were combined by
using the Boolean ‘‘AND.’’ The terms that were used
within these major search categories were combined
by using the Boolean ‘‘OR.’’ Because some trials were
performed that used survival as a secondary outcome
and the prevention of venous thromboses development as primary outcome, this search was also performed by replacing the survival search terms with
venous thromboembolism terms, including deep
vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The literature search was performed without any language
restrictions.55

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
The studies included had to be RCTs of adult cancer
patients without a concurrent diagnosis of venous
thromboembolism comparing anticoagulation drug
therapy and an appropriate control group. Anticoagulation had to consist of LMWH, UFH, or an oral
vitamin K antagonist. To ensure an adequate amount
of therapeutic time, anticoagulation had to be given
on a continuous basis for >4 weeks without interruption unless clinically indicated. Studies were required

to have overall mortality as a planned primary or
secondary outcome. To avoid publication bias,
reports that were published only in abstract form
were included if they had been presented at a major
international conference in the last 3 years.
To avoid biased results, studies were excluded if
they were nonrandomized reports or post-hoc subgroup analyses or if they included noncancer patients.
Given the significantly different clinical setting, studies related to indwelling catheters, surgery, or intraportal heparin infusion were not included. To ensure
an adequate assessment of the drug efficacy, trials
were not allowed to examine a combination of anticoagulants or to have any other differences between
study arms apart from the anticoagulation therapy
under investigation. Among duplicate publications,
the most recently updated information was included.

Data Extraction and Study Outcomes
Two reviewers independently extracted the data
(N.M.K. and A.A.K.) on basic study design, patient
characteristics, study outcomes, and measures of
study quality. Any disagreements were resolved by
consensus and third-party adjudication (G.H.L.).
Data for analysis were abstracted systematically from
the published reports and included 1) authors and
citation; 2) type and stage of malignancy and other
demographic patient characteristics; 3) drugs, doses,
and schedule of anticoagulation therapy; 4) study
design parameters; 5) the number of patients randomized; 6) the number of patients evaluable; and 7)
the cumulative proportion of patients that experienced specific outcomes. Overall study quality was
evaluated by using the method of Jadad et al., a validated quality-assessment instrument.56,57 The instrument evaluates study quality based on the methods
of randomization and blinding and the description of
study withdrawals. The possible scoring range is
from 0 to 5, with good quality represented by a score
3. The primary study outcomes were 1-year overall
mortality and all bleeding complications. Major
bleeding, as defined by each study, as well as fatal
bleeding events were secondary study outcomes.
Meta-analysis and Statistical Testing
The overall summary risk estimates represent the
weighted sum of the individual estimates using the
reciprocal of the variance as weights. Forest plots are
presented that display point estimates and 95%
confidence limits for each study as well as the weighted
summary estimates. When such data were not available
directly, the cumulative proportion surviving at 1 year
was extracted from the published survival curves.58
When no significant heterogeneity was observed, a

1151

fixed-effects model was employed using the method of
Mantel and Haenszel59; whereas a random-effects
model based on the method of DerSimonian and Laird
was used when significant heterogeneity was encountered, employing a conservative P value < .10.60 Potential heterogeneity was evaluated based on the Cochran
Q statistic, which represents the weighted sum of
squared differences between the pooled effect estimates across studies and the individual study effects.61
The power of the Q statistic for identifying heterogeneity may be too low or too high with a small or large
number of studies, respectively. Therefore, it is used
best in conjunction with the inconsistency index (I2),62
which is relatively independent of the number of studies.63 Effect measures also were analyzed for a priori
defined subgroup and sensitivity analyses, including
type of control group, study quality, type of anticoagulant, length of anticoagulation, concurrent chemotherapy, type of cancer, and stage of disease. The potential
influence of these study and patient characteristics on
outcomes also was explored in meta-regression analysis by regressing the estimated treatment effect on prespecified subgroups.
Estimates of standard error and 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs) for all individual studies and for
the weighted summary effect estimate were based on
a z statistic.64 Interaction was evaluated between the
type of anticoagulation and a priori specified subgroups. Statistically significant differences between
subgroups were studied by comparing the ratio of
the difference in the natural logarithm of the subgroup relative risk (RR) estimates and the standard
error of the difference with the standard normal distribution.65,66 The presence of potential publication
or selection bias was evaluated qualitatively using
funnel plots that displayed the treatment effect as
the logarithm of the risk ratio versus the inverse
standard error of the logarithm of the treatment
effect. Potential publication or selection bias was
evaluated quantitatively by using the rank correlation
method of Begg and Mazumdar based on the Kendall
s67 and also was evaluated by using Egger et al.’s
regression intercept method, which employs the
actual values of the effect sizes and their variance to
regress the standardized effect on precision or
inverse of the standard error.68 Significance was
based on 2-tailed testing for all analyses.

farin; whereas only 1 study was performed with
unfractionated heparin.43 Haas et al. have not published their findings from the Thrombosis Prophylaxis in Oncologic Patients with Certoparin (TOPIC) I
and TOPIC II studies in full, and more detailed information is not yet available.50,51 Therefore, the current
results are based on an abstract publication (Table
1). Three studies (27%) identified that had Jadad
scores of 2, and only 2 studies (18%) performed a
strict intention-to-treat analysis.

a more careful evaluation (Fig. 1). Most of these studies were nonrandomized. Thirteen studies included
noncancer patients, or did not make the information
regarding cancer patients available, and/or constituted a post-hoc subgroup analysis. Three studies
were cost analyses, and 3 studies were duplicate
publications. Two studies did not describe the methods or results adequately, making them impossible to
evaluate. Overall, 11 separate RCTs, which were
reported in 12 publications, were eligible for the
current analysis (Table 1).38,40–44,48–52,69 One trial
reported mortality data and bleeding results separately in 2 different publications.39,69

Study Characteristics
All 11 clinical trials (12 reports) were performed in
patients who had solid tumor patients, with some
studies utilizing a mixture of different tumor types
(Table 1). Six studies (55%) were placebocontrolled,41,48–52 and 1 placebo-controlled study
switched to a nonplacebo-controlled protocol after it
was identified as a major obstacle for adequate
accrual.52 Six studies (55%) compared LMWH with a
control group, and 4 studies (36%) investigated war-

One-Year Overall Mortality
Across all eligible studies, according to the fixedeffects model, anticoagulation significantly decreased
1-year overall mortality with an RR of 0.905 (95% CI,
0.847–0.967; P 5 .003) (Fig. 2). The RR of dying at
1 year for patients who received LMWH was 0.877
(95% CI, 0.789–0.975; P 5 .015), and, for patients who
received warfarin, the RR of dying at 1 year was
0.942 (95% CI, 0.854–1.040; P 5 .239). The RR estimates remained virtually unchanged when a random-effects model was employed (all studies: RR,
0.915; 95% CI, 0.858–0.976; P 5 .007; LMWH: RR,
0.875; 95% CI, 0.788–0.972; P 5 .013; warfarin: RR,
0.958; 95% CI, 0.876–1.047; P 5 .345) (data not
shown). This trend in improved survival was
observed among all types of anticoagulants but
reached statistical significance only with LMWH.
However, in a comparison of LMWH with warfarin,
no significant difference regarding 1-year overall
mortality between these 2 types of anticoagulants
was observed (P 5 .418). The absolute risk difference
(ARD) in mortality was 8.0% (95% CI, 1.6–14.3%)
among LMWH studies and 3% (95% CI, 21.9–7.9%)
among warfarin trials.
All Bleeding Complications
All bleeding complications were increased with anticoagulation compared with controls (RR, 2.309; 95%
CI, 1.928–2.764; P < .0001) (Fig. 3). A significant
increase in all bleeding was observed for both
LMWH and warfarin with estimated RRs of 2.029
(95% CI, 1.205–3.417; P 5 .008) and 2.366 (95% CI,
1.954–2.866; P < .0001), respectively (Fig. 3). Bleeding
risk was not increased significantly in the single
UFH study. In the random-effects model, the RR for
bleeding was 2.110 overall (95% CI, 1.645–2.705;
P < .0001), 1.900 for LMWH (95% CI, 0.948–3.806;
P 5 .070), and 2.171 for warfarin (95% CI, 1.632–
2.889; P < .0001) (data not shown). Patients who
received warfarin experienced a significant increase
in ARD (22.5%; 95% CI, 18.2–26.9%) for all bleeding
events compared with an ARD of 2.4% (95% CI, 0.7–
4.1%) in patients who received LMWH (P < .0001).

Major Bleeding Complications
Across all studies, major bleeding events increased
with anticoagulation (RR, 2.598; 95% CI, 1.936–3.488;
P < .0001) (Fig. 4). Among the 3 anticoagulants, only
warfarin reached a statistically significant increased
risk of major bleeding events (RR, 2.979; 95% CI,
2.134–4.157; P < .0001) compared with controls,
whereas patients who received LMWH experienced a
nonsignificant increased RR of 1.678 (95% CI, 0.861–
3.269; P 5 .128) (Fig. 4). These results remained
unchanged in a random-effects model (overall: RR,
2.374; 95% CI, 1.679–3.357; P < .0001; LMWH: RR,
1.571; 95% CI, 0.743–3.321; P 5 .237; warfarin: RR,
2.682; 95% CI, 1.783–4.036; P < .0001). Patients who
received warfarin experienced substantially more
major bleeding events (ARD, 11.5%; 95% CI, 8.5–
14.5%) compared with patients who received LMWH
(ARD, 1.0%; 95% CI, 0.3–2.3%; P < .0001).

Fatal Events
Six of 1226 patients who received anticoagulation
treatment (0.49%), compared with 2 of 1209 control
patients (0.17%), experienced a fatal bleeding complication in the 9 studies that reported this outcome
(RR, 1.422; 95% CI, 0.459–4.412; P 5 .542; data not

shown). No patient with a fatal pulmonary embolism
was reported in any of the studies.

Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses and Meta-regression
All subgroup analyses should be considered as
hypothesis-generating only. Because of limited statistical power, they also are prone to produce falsenegative results. Nevertheless, results from the a
priori defined sensitivity and subgroup analyses indicated that the reduction in overall mortality and the
increase in bleeding complications associated with
anticoagulation were observed independent of study
quality, use of placebo controls, length of anticoagulation treatment, and the intended use of chemotherapy. There were no significant differences in estimated treatment effects for all 3 outcome measures based on these study or patient characteristics
(Table 2). The available trials did not permit subgroup analyses of the influence of cancer type and
stage or anticoagulation timing and dosing. The
potential influence of these patient and study characteristics on mortality risk reduction also was
explored in meta-regression analysis by regressing
the estimated treatment effect on these prespecified
subgroups. In concurrence with the findings
described above, none of these characteristics, except

for tumor type (P 5 .005), significantly influenced the
mortality risk reduction caused by anticoagulation.

Publication or Selection Bias
Neither major nor minor study outcomes were subject to any publication or selection bias based on
funnel plot analysis. The absence of publication bias
was confirmed quantitatively for all outcomes on the
basis of nonsignificant P values both for the rankcorrelation method of Begg and Mazumdar and for
Egger et al.’s regression-intercept method.

DISCUSSION
The current report represents a comprehensive, systematic review regarding the efficacy and safety of
anticoagulants as antineoplastic therapy. The metaanalysis demonstrated a significant reduction in
overall mortality with anticoagulant therapy in cancer patients without venous thromboembolism.
These findings were most pronounced for LMWH,
which produced an RR reduction in mortality of
13.3% compared with a nonsignificant reduction
with warfarin of 5.8%. Both major and all bleeding
complications were increased significantly in anticoagulant-treated patients compared with controls
and in patients who received warfarin compared
with patients who received LMWH. LMWH-treated
patients experienced a 2.4% absolute risk increase in

any bleeding episode and a 1% absolute increase in
major bleeding events. This is in contrast to 22.5% of
warfarin-treated patients developing any type of
bleeding and 11.5% experiencing a major bleeding
event. No difference between anticoagulants was
observed among fatal bleeding episodes, but this
may have been due to the small number of events.
The single study that used UFH did not permit any
firm conclusions to be drawn.
To ensure the reporting of the most valid effect
estimates and to avoid potential publication or selection bias, trials that reported subgroup analyses of
cancer patients were not included in the current
analyses, and no language restrictions were imposed.55 The improved survival observed with anticoagulants does not appear to be the result of
decreased thromboembolic events. None of the trials
reported a case of fatal venous thromboembolism.
The diagnosis of fatal venous and arterial thromboembolic events may be underestimated, because
diagnosis can be difficult, and none of the studies
performed routine autopsies. This constitutes a limitation of the available data. Furthermore, screening
for venous thromboembolic events was based solely
on clinical evaluation in all published trials. Nevertheless, fatal thromboembolic events are unlikely to
account for the magnitude of the observed survival
benefit from anticoagulation. This observed treatment effect translates into absolute risk reductions
for mortality of 8% with LMWH and a nonsignificant
3% reduction for warfarin. However, we observed no
statistical difference in mortality reduction between
LMWH and warfarin. It remains unclear whether
there is a true difference in the impact on mortality
between the 2 anticoagulants or whether this reflects
a lack of statistical power. A meta-analysis examining
differences in efficacy between LMWH and oral vitamin K antagonists in cancer patients with a concurrent diagnosis of venous thromboembolism did not
report a difference in mortality.70 Our study also did
not permit any firm conclusions about potential differences between LMWH and UFH. Several studies
that are investigating cancer subgroups have suggested a survival improvement for LMWH as initial
therapy for venous thrombosis compared with UFH
in cancer patients.71–75
None of the patient characteristics, trial quality,
or other design parameters appear to influence the
mortality outcome other than the type of cancer,
as suggested previously.38,39 Although this finding
requires further validation, it suggests the importance of studying the association between anticoagulants and cancer survival by specific tumor sites. The
currently available trials did not allow us to analyze

Anticoagulants and Cancer Survival/Kuderer et al.

the influence of cancer stage, anticoagulation timing,
or dosing. In post-hoc subgroup analyses, previous
trials have suggested the absence of a beneficial
effect of anticoagulation on mortality in patients who
have advanced-stage cancer, compared with patients
who have either early-stage cancer or a more favorable prognosis.48,76
Our current findings are consistent with abundant in vitro and in vivo laboratory data, which suggest that anticoagulants, particularly LMWH, exert an
antineoplastic effect.15–30,50,77 It has been reported
that heparins inhibit primary tumor growth, reduce
tumor cell motility, inhibit tumor cell migration,
reduce the formation of metastases, enhance the
antitumor effects of chemotherapy, and prolong the
survival of laboratory animals after tumor cell inoculation.18,24,27,31,78–91 The specific mechanism of this
effect has not been determined clearly, but it most
likely involves several pathways, including the inhibition of angiogenesis26,92–96 and a change in tumor
biology.19–22,25,30,79,97,98 In addition, fibrin deposits
surrounding many viable tumors and tumor cells not
only protect against an immunologic attack99–101 but
also enable metastasis formation19,20,97,102–107 and stimulate angiogenesis.108 Furthermore, it is believed
that thrombin acts as an autocrine growth factor that
can increase the expression of c-myc proto-oncogene
and tissue factor.109–113
Not surprisingly, anticoagulation significantly
increased bleeding complications. However, lifethreatening bleeding events were extremely rare.
LMWH appears to have a more favorable bleeding
profile. Patients who received warfarin experienced
substantially more major bleeding events (11.5%)
compared with patients who received LMWH (1%).
Although this difference in bleeding risk between
LMWH and warfarin may have been caused in part
by differences in the definition of bleeding events
and in trial patient populations, these results correspond to previously reported findings in patients
with and without cancer.76,114–121 Despite the administration of anticoagulants in conjunction with chemotherapy in many of the trials, the prevalence and
impact of chemotherapy- and heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia remain unknown.
Limitations of the current study include the unavailability of mortality data from the recently
reported TOPIC I and II studies.50,51 However, no evidence for publication or selection bias was identified
for any study outcome. Similar to the majority of
meta-analyses, individual patient data were not
made available for this study122; however, in the absence of confounding, it has been reported that
meta-analyses based on aggregate data produce very

1157

similar results compared with individual patient data
meta-analyses.123,124 The limited quality of some of
the identified studies did not appear to alter summary effect measures. Although they increased the
clinical relevance of the current meta-analysis, all
subgroup analyses need to be interpreted as hypothesis-generating only. Given the small numbers in
subgroups, negative results may not be caused by
the absence of a treatment effect but may be secondary to a lack of statistical power to confirm treatment
efficacy. All identified trials were performed in
patients with solid tumors and, thus, did not provide
any information regarding patients with hematologic
malignancies.
Important questions that remain with regard to
the therapeutic value of anticoagulation in cancer
patients include the optimal cancer types; the influence of disease stage on treatment effect; duration,
and timing of anticoagulation; and the extent of
patient monitoring to ensure safety. Given the limitations of available studies and the potential for serious complications from anticoagulation therapy,
these findings need to be confirmed in future, welldesigned, adequately powered, RCTs before the clinical use of anticoagulants as cancer therapy can be
recommended. Nevertheless, our findings are reassuring with regard to the overall efficacy and safety
of especially LMWH in the treatment of cancer
patients and should encourage the further study of
these agents as antineoplastic therapy.
