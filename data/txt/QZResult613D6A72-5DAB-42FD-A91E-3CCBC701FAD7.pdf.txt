Abstract
Extracellular free amino acids contribute to the interaction
between a tumor and its microenvironment through effects on
cellular metabolism and malignant behavior. System xc(–) is
composed of xCT and CD98hc subunits and functions as a plasma
membrane antiporter for the uptake of extracellular cystine in
exchange for intracellular glutamate. Here, we show that the EGFR
interacts with xCT and thereby promotes its cell surface expression
and function in human glioma cells. EGFR-expressing glioma cells
manifested both enhanced antioxidant capacity as a result of
increased cystine uptake, as well as increased glutamate, which

promotes matrix invasion. Imaging mass spectrometry also
revealed that brain tumors formed in mice by human glioma
cells stably overexpressing EGFR contained higher levels of
reduced glutathione compared with those formed by parental
cells. Targeted inhibition of xCT suppressed the EGFR-dependent
enhancement of antioxidant capacity in glioma cells, as well
as tumor growth and invasiveness. Our ﬁndings establish a new
functional role for EGFR in promoting the malignant potential
of glioma cells through interaction with xCT at the cell surface.

Introduction

they often exhibit high levels of expression of cell surface transporters and receptors for amino acids (4). System xc(–), which
consists of a light-chain subunit (xCT, SLC7A11) and a heavychain subunit (CD98hc, SLC3A2), is a major plasma membrane
antiporter that mediates the cellular uptake of cystine in exchange
for intracellular glutamate. Surface expression of xCT increases the
uptake of cystine required for intracellular synthesis of reduced
glutathione (GSH; refs. 5, 6) and is thus an important determinant
of intracellular redox balance in cancer cells (7, 8). We recently
showed that variant isoforms of CD44 (CD44v), but not the
standard isoform (CD44s), interact with and stabilize xCT and
thereby potentiate the ability of cancer cells to defend themselves
against reactive oxygen species (ROS; refs. 6, 9, 10). In addition to
CD44v-expressing cancer cells, several cancer cell types, including
glioma cells that do not express CD44v (11, 12), have also recently
been shown to manifest a high level of surface xCT expression and
consequent enhanced uptake of extracellular cystine (13, 14).
However, the mechanism by which surface xCT expression and
the consequent cystine uptake and GSH synthesis is regulated in a
manner independent of CD44v in CD44s-expressing cancer cells
has remained unknown.
Extracellular glutamate has been shown to play a key role in
malignant behavior of cancer cells, including cell proliferation
and matrix invasion (15, 16). Malignant glioma cells that express
CD44s (but not CD44v) have been shown to release large
amounts of glutamate in the brain (11, 17, 18), suggesting that
system xc(–) is activated in CD44s-expressing glioma cells and
generates a glutamate-rich microenvironment. However, the
mechanism of xCT regulation in glioma cells and the functional
relevance of system xc(–) to the interaction of these cells with their
microenvironment have not been elucidated.

An emerging concept relating to the interaction between a
tumor and its microenvironment is that external amino acids
support the survival and propagation of cancer cells (1). Cancer
cells manifest an increased demand for and consumption of
amino acids as a result of their altered metabolism (2, 3), and

EGFR Regulates xCT in Glioma

We have now investigated the molecular mechanism by which
surface xCT expression is regulated in glioma cells that express
CD44s (but not CD44v), as well as the functional role of amino
acids, including cystine and glutamate, in the promotion of the
malignant potential of glioma.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
T98G, U87MG, and U251MG cells were obtained from ATCC,
and KNS42 and Becker cells were from JRCB Cell Bank in 2014.
These cells were maintained under 5% CO2 at 37 C in DMEM
containing glucose at 4.5 g/L (Nacalai) and supplemented with
10% FBS. All cell lines were used within 6 months to 1 year upon
receipt of cells, and characterization by STR analysis was performed before use. Human primary glioblastoma MGG18 and
GB2 cells were obtained from Massachusetts General Hospital
(Boston, MA) and The University of Tokyo (Tokyo, Japan) in
October and November of 2015, respectively, and were cultured
as described previously (19, 20).
Drug treatment in vivo
U87MG or U87MG-EGFR cells (2  106) were implanted
subcutaneously in the ﬂank of nude mice. The mice were then
injected intraperitoneally with saline, sulfasalazine (250 mg/kg),
cisplatin (2 mg/kg), or both drugs, with saline and sulfasalazine
being injected once a day and cisplatin injected once every 3 days
for 14 days. All animal experiments were performed in accordance
with protocols approved by the Ethics Committee of Keio University (Tokyo, Japan).
Measurement of reduced and oxidized GSH, cysteine content,
and cystine uptake
The intracellular contents of reduced (GSH) and oxidized
(GSSG) glutathione and of cysteine in U87MG and U87MG-EGFR
cells were measured by capillary electrophoresis combined with
mass spectrometry (Agilent Technology). For measurement of
cystine uptake, cells were incubated for 5 minutes at 37 C with
DMEM supplemented with 15N2-L-cystine (>98% purity, 0.0938
g/L; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), lysed, and assayed for
15
N1-cysteine incorporation.
In vitro invasion assay
The cell suspensions of MGG18 or GB2 cells (200 mL) were
transferred to the upper chamber of inserts with a pore size of 8.0
mm whose bottom surface was coated with laminin (Corning).
Sulfasalazine (200 mmol/L) or glutamate (250 mmol/L) was
added to the medium in both upper and lower chambers. After
culture for 12 hours, the number of cells on the lower surface of
each insert was determined.
Imaging mass spectrometry
U87MG cells (2  105) were injected into the left hemisphere
of NOD/SCID mice, and after 7 days, U87MG-EGFR cells (2 
105) were injected into the right hemisphere. After an additional 2 weeks, the brain with embedded tumors was dissected
and subjected to imaging mass spectrometry with Mass Microscope (Shimadzu). More detailed version of methods and
additional methodology is included in the Supplementary
Methods.

Results
EGFR promotes cell surface expression of xCT in glioma cells
To investigate the mechanism underlying the regulation of xCT
expression in CD44s-expressing cancer cells, we studied human
glioma cell lines that express CD44s, but not CD44v (Fig. 1A).
Examination of xCT expression in these cells revealed that T98G
showed the highest level of such expression and that U87MG and
Becker showed the lowest levels (Fig. 1B). To identify cell surface
proteins that show an expression proﬁle similar to that of xCT in
T98G cells (xCThigh) as well as U87MG and Becker cells (xCTlow),
we performed ﬂow cytometric analysis of various proteins that
had previously been found to be overexpressed in malignant
glioma cells (21–29). Among the examined cell surface molecules, the expression proﬁle of EGFR was found to be similar to
that of xCT in these glioma cells (Fig. 1C). To examine further the
relevance of EGFR to xCT expression in glioma cells, we depleted
EGFR in T98G cells by RNAi. Knockdown of EGFR reduced the
abundance of xCT at the cell surface (Fig. 1D). Furthermore,
expression of a siRNA-resistant EGFR construct prevented the
downregulation of surface xCT expression induced by knockdown
of endogenous EGFR (Fig. 1E). Together, these results suggested
that the xCT expression is associated with that of EGFR in these
xCThigh glioma cells. We next investigated MGG18 and GB2
primary human glioblastoma cells (19, 20). Flow cytometry
showed that depletion of EGFR by RNAi reduced the surface xCT
expression in both MGG18 and GB2 cells (Fig. 1F), suggesting that
EGFR expression is also associated with the surface xCT expression
in patient-derived glioblastoma cells.
The expression level of EGFR is correlated with that of xCT in
human gliomas
Given that EGFR gene is often ampliﬁed and overexpressed in
glioma cells (30, 31), we next examined whether the expression
level of EGFR is related to that of xCT in clinical glioma specimens.
Immunostaining of 140 such specimens revealed that the level of
xCT expression was signiﬁcantly higher in EGFR-positive samples
than in EGFR-negative samples, whereas it was similar in CD44positive and CD44-negative samples (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the
expression level of EGFR in the 56 EGFR-positive gliomas was
signiﬁcantly correlated with that of xCT (Fig. 2B and C). These
results suggested that the expression of xCT is associated with that
of EGFR, but not with that of CD44, in human gliomas.
EGFR interacts with xCT through its intracellular domain and
thereby promotes surface xCT expression
To examine the mechanism underlying the regulation of
xCT expression by EGFR, we depleted T98G cells of EGFR by
RNAi. Knockdown of EGFR reduced the total abundance of
xCT (Fig. 3A), suggesting that EGFR might affect the amount
of cell surface xCT expression by inﬂuencing the overall level
of this protein.
Given that EGFR inﬂuences cancer cell behavior in both a
kinase-dependent and -independent manner (32, 33), we made
use of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor geﬁtinib. Whereas 1- or
2-mmol/L geﬁtinib blocked EGF-induced activation of EGFR in
T98G cells (Fig. 3B), it had no effect on the total abundance (Fig.
3C) or cell surface expression (Supplementary Fig. S1A) of xCT,
suggesting that EGFR promotes xCT expression in a manner
independent of its kinase activity. Furthermore, the abundance
of xCT mRNA did not differ between control and EGFR-depleted

T98G cells (Fig. 3D), indicating that the effect of EGFR on xCT
protein level is independent of transcriptional control of the xCT
gene. Given that the localization of cell surface xCT is associated
with an increase in its protein stability (6), we next examined
whether EGFR knockdown might reduce the stability of xCT
protein. Treatment of cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide revealed that the level of xCT declined at a faster
rate in EGFR-depleted cells than in control cells (Fig. 3E). Together, these observations suggested that EGFR increases the stability
of xCT protein and thereby enhances the cell surface xCT expression in glioma cells.
Given that the physical interaction of CD44v with xCT promotes the cell surface expression and function of xCT through
protein stabilization (6), we next investigated whether EGFR
physically interacts with xCT in EGFR-expressing glioma cells.
Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that EGFR indeed interacts with xCT in T98G cells (Fig. 3F). Immunoﬂuorescence staining also showed extensive colocalization of EGFR and xCT in these
cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). We further examined the interaction between EGFR and xCT in T98G cells with the use of a
proximity ligation assay (PLA), which allows direct observation of
endogenous protein–protein interaction (34). In situ PLA signals
(red dots), which reﬂect protein–protein interaction, were
detected with target antibodies to EGFR and to xCT (Fig. 3G),
providing further evidence that endogenous EGFR interacts with
endogenous xCT in glioma cells.
We next examined whether CD44 expression is indeed dispensable for EGFR-mediated promotion of surface xCT expression in glioma cells. Flow cytometry revealed that EGFR knock-

down markedly reduced the surface xCT expression not only in
T98G cells expressing a control shRNA but also in those expressing
a CD44 shRNA (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D), suggesting that
EGFR-dependent promotion of surface xCT expression is independent of CD44 expression status in these cells. Consistent with
these results, coimmunoprecipitation analysis showed that the
EGFR–xCT complex precipitated from T98G cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1E) or from patient-derived MGG18 or GB2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1F) was devoid of CD44. Both MGG18 and GB2
cells also manifested endogenous EGFR–xCT interaction in the in
situ PLA assay (Supplementary Fig. S1G). These results thus
suggested that physical interaction with EGFR promotes the
surface xCT expression.
To identify the domain of EGFR that mediates xCT interaction,
we performed immunoprecipitation analysis with HEK293T cells
expressing various EGFR deletion mutants (Fig. 3H). Wild-type
(WT) EGFR as well as the mutants EGFRvIII and DN-term were
found to interact with xCT, whereas the mutant DC-term, which
lacks most of the intracellular domain, did not (Fig. 3H), indicating that the intracellular domain of EGFR is required for xCT
interaction. Forced expression of the DN-term mutant, but not
that of DC-term, also increased surface xCT expression in EGFRdepleted T98G glioma cells (Fig. 3I), suggesting that the intracellular domain of EGFR (residues 685–1186) is essential for the
EGFR–xCT interaction that underlies the promotion of surface
xCT expression.
We next examined the region of xCT responsible for the
interaction with EGFR. xCT contains 12 transmembrane domains,
as well as NH2- and COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tails (Fig. 3J). In

EGFR Regulates xCT in Glioma

addition to full-length xCT, deletion mutants lacking the NH2terminal (xCT-D1–44) or COOH-terminal (xCT-D471–501) cytoplasmic tails were found to interact with EGFR in transfected
HEK293T cells (Fig. 3J), suggesting that the central portion of xCT
containing the 12 transmembrane domains (amino acids 45–
470) is sufﬁcient for interaction with EGFR. Together, our data
thus suggested that the intracellular domain of EGFR interacts
with the central portion of xCT and thereby promotes surface xCT
expression.
Surface xCT regulates redox status and thereby supports
glioma cell viability
Given that an increase in the amount of surface xCT enhances
cystine uptake (6), we next examined whether EGFR expression
might promote cystine uptake in glioma cells with the use of
U87MG cells stably overexpressing EGFR (U87MG-EGFR cells).
The level of surface xCT expression in U87MG-EGFR cells was
increased compared with that in the parental U87MG cells,
whereas the amount of xCT mRNA did not differ between the
two cell lines (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S2A). The extent of
L-cystine uptake (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Table S1) as well as the
intracellular level of cysteine (Supplementary Fig. S2B) in
U87MG-EGFR cells were signiﬁcantly increased compared with
those in U87MG cells, suggesting that forced expression of EGFR
might promote cystine uptake and thereby increase intracellular
cysteine abundance through enhancement of surface xCT expression. Given that the availability of cysteine is rate limiting for GSH
synthesis, we also measured the levels of GSH and total glutathione in these cells. The amounts of both GSH and total glutathione
(GSH þ the disulﬁde-linked dimer GSSG) were signiﬁcantly
increased in U87MG-EGFR cells compared with parental U87MG
cells (Fig. 4C). Conversely, depletion of EGFR in T98G cells
signiﬁcantly reduced the intracellular abundance of GSH (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Furthermore, imaging mass spectrometry
revealed that brain tumors formed by U87MG-EGFR cells in mice
showed markedly higher GSH levels than did those formed by
U87MG cells (Fig. 4D), suggesting that the upregulation of surface
xCT expression by EGFR results in the increased GSH synthesis in
glioma cells in vivo. Together, our observations thus indicated that
EGFR upregulates the surface xCT expression and thereby
increases cystine uptake and GSH synthesis in glioma cells.
To determine whether the upregulation of xCT-dependent
cystine transport by EGFR plays a role in maintenance of the
redox status in glioma cells, we examined the effects of sulfasalazine, a speciﬁc inhibitor of xCT. The viability of xCThigh
glioma cells (T98G and U87MG-EGFR) was highly sensitive to
sulfasalazine, whereas that of xCTlow glioma cells (U87MG and
Becker) was less so (Fig. 4E), suggesting that EGFRhigh glioma
cells depend on xCT-mediated cystine transport for their survival. To investigate further the role of xCT-dependent cystine
transport in EGFRhigh cancer cells, we examined whether xCT
might regulate the intracellular ROS level in these cells. Sulfasalazine increased the intracellular ROS level in EGFRhigh/
xCThigh glioma cells (U87MG-EGFR and T98G) in a manner
sensitive to the presence of exogenous antioxidants, such as
Trolox and N-acetylcysteine (NAC; Fig. 4F). In contrast, sulfasalazine failed to increase the intracellular ROS level in
EGFRlow/xCTlow cells (U87MG and Becker; Supplementary Fig.
S2D). These results suggested that xCT-dependent cystine transport regulates redox status in EGFRhigh/xCThigh glioma cells, but
not in EGFRlow/xCTlow cells.

www.aacrjournals.org

We next examined whether the disruption of redox status by
sulfasalazine contributes to the cytotoxic effect of this drug on
EGFRhigh/xCThigh glioma cells. The antioxidants Trolox and NAC,
but not glutamate, which is released by xCT in exchange for
cystine, prevented the decrease in cell viability induced by sulfasalazine in both U87MG-EGFR and T98G cells (Fig. 4G), implicating disruption of redox status due to cysteine depletion in
sulfasalazine-induced suppression of cell survival in EGFRhigh/
xCThigh glioma cells. Depletion of xCT by RNAi also suppressed
the viability of U87MG-EGFR cells without affecting that of
U87MG cells (Supplementary Fig. S2E), suggesting that EGFR
expression is associated with xCT dependency in glioma cells.
We examined whether sulfasalazine might affect EGFR signaling in glioma cells. However, we found that sulfasalazine had no
effect on the EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation of EGFR or its
downstream targets ERK and AKT (Supplementary Fig. S2F),
suggesting that sulfasalazine reduces the viability of EGFRhigh/
xCThigh glioma cells without affecting EGFR signaling.
Given that sulfasalazine reduced cell survival of EGFRhigh/
xCThigh glioma cells, we next examined whether the depletion
of EGFR, which regulates surface xCT expression, reduces the cell
viability of these cells. Similar to sulfasalazine treatment, RNAimediated EGFR depletion signiﬁcantly reduced cell viability of
T98G cells, whereas forced expression of xCT markedly recovered
the viability of EGFR-depleted T98G cells (Fig. 4H), suggesting
that EGFRhigh/xCThigh glioma cells depend on the EGFR-promoted activity of system xc(–) for their survival.
We also examined the impact of sulfasalazine on the subcutaneous tumors formed by EGFRlow/xCTlow (U87MG) or EGFRhigh/
xCThigh (U87MG-EGFR) cells in nude mice. Administration of
sulfasalazine attenuated the growth of tumors formed by
U87MG-EGFR cells but not that of those formed by U87MG cells
(Fig. 4I), suggesting that xCT plays a role in tumor growth in
EGFRhigh/xCThigh glioma cells, but not in EGFRlow/xCTlow cells.
Given that the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin exerts its anticancer effects in part through ROS generation in cancer cells (35), we
next examined whether sulfasalazine might enhance the antitumor effect of cisplatin. Administration of sulfasalazine was indeed
found to enhance the antitumor effect of cisplatin on tumor
xenografts formed by U87MG-EGFR cells (Fig. 4I), suggesting
that the sulfasalazine-induced attenuation of ROS defense sensitizes EGFRhigh/xCThigh glioma cells to ROS-inducing anticancer
agents. Together, these observations indicated that xCT-dependent cystine transport contributes to the maintenance of redox
status and thereby promotes cell survival and tumorigenesis in
EGFRhigh/xCThigh glioma cells, but not in EGFRlow/xCTlow cells.
Inhibition of system xc(–) suppresses EGFR-expressing
glioma cell invasion
Given that extracellular glutamate has been shown to enhance
cell motility (16), we next examined the possible role of glutamate
release through system xc(–) in glioma cell migration. Glutamate
release was found to be markedly increased in U87MG-EGFR cells
compared with U87MG cells (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, knockdown
of xCT or EGFR in U87MG-EGFR cells reduced the level of
glutamate release to that apparent in parental U87MG cells (Fig.
5A). In contrast, geﬁtinib did not affect the level of glutamate
release (Fig. 5A), suggesting that EGFR kinase activity is dispensable for the enhancement of xCT-mediated glutamate release by
EGFR. U87MG cells stably expressing the EGFRvIII mutant
(U87MG-EGFRvIII cells) also showed increased levels of surface

xCT expression (Supplementary Fig. S3A) and glutamate release
(Supplementary Fig. S3B) compared with parental U87MG cells.
Furthermore, EGFR knockdown reduced the extent of glutamate
release in the patient-derived MGG18 and GB2 cells (Fig. 5B).
Together, these results suggested that glutamate release mediated
by xCT in glioma cells is enhanced by EGFR or EGFRvIII expression in a manner independent of EGFR kinase activity.
Given that glutamate is thought to promote cell migration in an
autocrine manner (16), we examined whether the inhibition of
glutamate release might suppress the migration of glioma cells. An
in vitro scratch assay revealed that sulfasalazine inhibited the

www.aacrjournals.org

migration of T98G cells and that this inhibition was attenuated
by the addition of glutamate (Fig. 5C), suggesting that released
glutamate promotes glioma cell migration in an autocrine manner. We next examined whether xCT-dependent glutamate release
plays a role in the promotion of glioma cell migration by various
chemoattractants (16). Sulfasalazine signiﬁcantly inhibited the
stimulatory effects of serum, EGF, amphiregulin, and TGFa on
U87MG-EGFR cell migration, and this inhibition was prevented
by the addition of glutamate (Fig. 5D). We also found that
sulfasalazine signiﬁcantly inhibited extracellular matrix invasion
by the patient-derived MGG18 and GB2 glioblastoma cells and

Tsuchihashi et al.

that this inhibition was prevented by glutamate (Fig. 5E). These
results suggested that xCT-dependent glutamate release promotes
migration and invasion by glioma cells.
To examine the functional relevance of xCT to glioma cell
invasion in the brain, we employed organotypic brain slice culture
system (Fig. 5F). EGF promoted the invasion of U87MG-EGFR
cells in this model in a manner sensitive to inhibition by the xCT
inhibitor sulfasalazine (Fig. 5G and H).
Finally, to evaluate the potential of xCT as a therapeutic target
for EGFRhigh glioma, we examined whether RNAi-mediated
depletion of xCT in U87MG-EGFR cells might affect the survival
of mice with orthotopic tumors formed by these cells. Stable
depletion of xCT prolonged survival compared with that observed
in mice implanted with control U87MG-EGFR cells (Fig. 5I).
Together, these observations indicated that xCT plays a key role
in the malignant behavior of glioma and that system xc(–) is
therefore a promising target for cancer therapy, especially for the
treatment of EGFRhigh glioma.

Discussion
Conventional cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and
radiotherapy, induce the generation of cytotoxic ROS in cancer
cells. Strategies to abrogate ROS defense in cancer cells might
therefore be expected to provide a basis for the development of
new and efﬁcient cancer therapies (36–38). The expression of xCT
is thought to be related to malignant potential in glioma (8), and a
recent study showed that xCT expression correlates with tumor
growth, glutamate-induced seizures, and poor prognosis in
patients with malignant glioma (39). We have now shown that
EGFR interacts through its intracellular domain with, and thereby
promotes, the surface xCT expression, leading to an increase in
cystine uptake and GSH synthesis in glioma cells that do not
express CD44v. Furthermore, the vIII mutant of EGFR also interacted with and increased the surface xCT expression, suggesting
that the expression level of EGFR, including both WT and mutant
forms, is a determinant of the activity of system xc(–) in glioma
cells. However, the EGFR kinase inhibitor geﬁtinib had no effect
on the surface xCT expression in EGFRhigh glioma cells. Together,
our results thus suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of EGFR
interacts with the central portion of xCT and thereby increases the
surface xCT expression in a kinase-independent manner.
CD44 was previously shown to interact with EGFR and to
inﬂuence EGFR signaling (40), and CD44 and EGFR were found
to be present in the same protein complex and to cooperatively
promote cancer cell invasion (41). However, in this study with
glioma cells, we found that CD44 did not interact with EGFR and
that the regulation of xCT expression by EGFR was not affected by
CD44. Given that the pattern of CD44 isoform expression differs
among cancer types, the molecular interaction of CD44 with
EGFR might be differentially regulated in a manner dependent
on cell type.
Inhibition of xCT-dependent cystine transport, which is potentiated by CD44v, induces cell death selectively in CD44v-expressing stem-like tumor cells (42). Consistent with this previous
observation, we found that glioma cells engineered to stably
express EGFR were more sensitive to sulfasalazine compared with
the parental cells, suggesting that EGFRhigh glioma cells that also
express xCT at a high level at the cell surface depend on system
xc(–) for regulation of intracellular redox status. Given that EGFR
activation results in the generation of ROS that act as a second

2962 Cancer Res; 76(10) May 15, 2016

messenger for physiologic cellular signaling (43–45), EGFRhigh
glioma cells might depend on xCT-mediated ROS defense to
avoid the harmful effects of ROS accumulation. Together, these
ﬁndings suggest that enhancement of GSH synthesis by EGFR or
CD44v may reprogram the antioxidant system of cancer cells and
that EGFR- or CD44v-expressing cancer cells, in which GSH plays
a central role in the regulation of redox status, are potential targets
of xCT inhibitors.
Recently, system xc(–) in malignant glioma cells was shown to
play a key role in the development of a glutamate-rich microenvironment that promotes neurodegeneration, brain edema, and
glioma invasion (13, 46). We have now shown that EGFRhigh or
EGFRvIIIhigh glioma cells that also express xCT at a high level at the
cell surface release relatively large amounts of glutamate through
system xc(–), suggesting that EGFR–xCT interaction in glioma
cells promotes the release of glutamate, which then contributes to
both cell-autonomous and chemotactic migration of EGFRhigh
glioma cells.
In conclusion, our current data provide evidence that the
association of EGFR with xCT enhances ROS defense in and
matrix invasion by glioma cells. Given that aggressive glioma
cells often generate a glutamate-rich microenvironment, the
EGFR–xCT axis might be a promising therapeutic target for
EGFRhigh or EGFRvIIIhigh glioma.
