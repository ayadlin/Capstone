BACKGROUND: Patients with Philadelphia chromosome–positive (Ph1) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) frequently relapse on
imatinib with acquisition of BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutations. To analyze the changes that second-generation tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) have brought in mutation frequency and type, a database review was undertaken of the results of all the BCR-ABL
KD mutation analyses performed in the authors’ laboratory from January 2004 to January 2013. METHODS: Interrogation of the database retrieved 450 mutation analyses in 272 patients with Ph1 ALL. Prescreening of samples was performed with denaturing highperformance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC), followed by direct sequencing of D-HPLC–positive cases. RESULTS: BCR-ABL KD
mutations were detected in 70% of imatinib-resistant patients, with T315I, E255K, and Y253H mutations accounting for 75% of cases.
Seventy-eight percent of the patients reported to be resistant to second-generation TKIs after imatinib failure were positive for mutations, and 58% of them had multiple mutations. Analysis of patients relapsing on dasatinib revealed a newly acquired T315I mutation
in almost two-thirds of the cases. Direct sequencing detected no mutations at diagnosis, even in patients who relapsed after a few
months. CONCLUSIONS: Second-generation TKIs ensure a more rapid debulking of the leukemic clone and have much fewer insensitive mutations, but long-term disease control remains a problem, and the T315I mutation is revealed to be an even more frequent
enemy. BCR-ABL KD mutation screening of patients with Ph1 ALL who are receiving imatinib or second-generation TKIs would be a
precious ally for timely treatment optimization. In contrast, the clinical usefulness of conventional direct sequencing at diagnosis

INTRODUCTION
The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, resulting in a BCR-ABL fusion protein with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity, is
the most common cytogenetic abnormality found in adult patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL),
as well as the hallmark of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Incorporation of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib
mesylate in the front-line treatment of patients with Ph-positive (Ph1) ALL has significantly improved the antileukemic
efficacy of induction therapy,1-6 so that imatinib combined with chemotherapy now represents the standard of care for all
newly diagnosed patients. In sharp contrast to CML, however, responses in Ph1 ALL are short-lived, and relapse is

frequently associated with the selection of point mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD), fostered by
the high genetic instability of ALL cells.
The development of second-generation TKIs has provided additional treatment options both for newly diagnosed
and for imatinib-resistant patients.7 Second-generation
TKIs have increased potency compared with imatinib and
retain efficacy against the majority of BCR-ABL mutant
forms. To analyze changes that second-generation TKIs
have brought in mutation frequency and type, we reviewed
the database of results of BCR-ABL KD mutation analyses
of the patients with Ph1 ALL who were referred to our laboratory from January 2004 to January 2013.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Definitions

A total of 272 patients with Ph1 ALL (150 males and
122 females; median age, 53 years, range, 17-79 years)
diagnosed and treated with TKI-based regimens at several
Italian Hematology Centers were referred to our central
reference laboratory for BCR-ABL KD mutation analysis
from January 2004 through January 2013. Patient
demographics and available clinical data are summarized
in Table 1. A total of 189 patients were analyzed at the
time of resistance to imatinib therapy. As detailed in
Cancer

April 1, 2014

Table 1, 3 patients were receiving induction therapy with
imatinib at 600 mg/day plus combination chemotherapy
according to the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche
dell’Adulto (GIMEMA) LAL0904 protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00458848); 10 patients were
receiving maintenance therapy with imatinib alone at the
dosage of 800 mg/day according to the GIMEMA
LAL0201B protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT00376467);1 73 patients were receiving imatinib
600 mg/day as maintenance after induction and consolidation chemotherapy according to the LAL2000 protocol
(n 5 34; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT0053755) or
similar institutional protocols (n 5 39). A total of 103
patients were receiving imatinib at 600 mg/day for
relapsed or refractory disease, 49 of whom received it after
allogeneic stem cell transplant.
Ninety-eight patients were analyzed at the time of resistance to dasatinib or nilotinib administered after imatinib
failure, including 71 cases who had already been analyzed at
the time of imatinib resistance. Fifty-seven patients received
dasatinib at a schedule of 70 mg twice daily (13 of them
were enrolled on the CA180-015 (START-L) study [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00101595]);8 36 patients
received dasatinib at a schedule of 140 mg once daily. Five
patients received nilotinib 400 mg twice daily according to
the CAMN107A2101 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT00109707)9 or on a compassionate-use basis.
Fourteen patients were resistant to dasatinib as firstline treatment; they were enrolled in the GIMEMA
LAL1205 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT00391989) and had received dasatinib 70 mg twice
daily plus steroids as induction and maintenance therapy.10
Our database also included 60 patients with newly
diagnosed Ph1 ALL who were prospectively screened for
mutations before the start of any treatment, to explore
whether TKI-resistant mutations could already be detectable with conventional methods. Of these 60 patients, 25
later lost the hematologic, cytogenetic, or molecular
response while on TKI therapy (imatinib, n 5 15; dasatinib, n 5 10); 18 patients, who were re-analyzed at the
time of relapse (and already counted above), were found
to have developed BCR-ABL KD mutations.
Triggers for mutation analysis included hematological relapse (89 cases), disease reappearance or disease persistence at cytogenetic level (38 cases), and/or disease
reappearance or disease persistence at the molecular level
(198 cases). The latter was defined based on molecular
evaluation of minimal residual disease, performed by realtime quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR)
with standardized Europe Against Cancer (EAC) primers

reappearance at the molecular level was defined as shift
from undetectable (BCR-ABL/ABLIS  0.001%) to detectable BCR-ABL transcripts.10 In 65 cases, the reason

Of 189 patients who were reported to be resistant to imatinib, 131 (69.3%) were positive for BCR-ABL KD mutations by D-HPLC. Subsequent direct sequencing analysis
allowed characterization of the nucleotide substitution(s) in
all the cases (Table 2). One hundred and seventeen
(89.3%) patients had a single mutation; 13 patients had 2
mutations and only 1 patient was found to harbor 3 different mutations. A spectrum of 16 types of amino acid substitutions at 13 different residues were detected (Table 3). It is
remarkable, however, that 3 of them, the T315I and the Ploop mutations E255K and Y253H, were by far the most
frequent, accounting for 75% of all resistant cases.

BCR-ABL KD Mutations in Ph1 ALL/Soverini et al

imatinib failure, 76 (78%) were positive for BCR-ABL
KD mutations. A total of 32 (42%) patients had a single
mutation; the remaining 44 (58%) patients had multiple
mutations: 2 mutations were detected in 33 patients, 3
mutations were in 9 patients, and 4 mutations were in 2
patients. In 71 of 98 cases, a BCR-ABL KD mutation
analysis had already been performed at the time of previous failure: this revealed that in more than two-thirds of
the cases, multiple mutations had accumulated as a consequence of multiple lines of TKI therapy rather than under
the same TKI.
Of these 98 patients, the great majority (n 5 93) were
resistant to dasatinib as second-line therapy, given that
dasatinib only among second-generation TKIs has been
approved since 2007 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory Ph1 ALL,18 whereas nilotinib was available only
within the phase 2 study or on a compassionate-use basis.
Resistance to dasatinib was reported to consist of hematological relapse or progressive disease in 37 cases, cytogenetic
relapse in 6 cases, failure to achieve a cytogenetic response
after 3 months in 4 cases, and molecular persistence or molecular recurrence in 46 cases. Of 93 patients who relapsed
while on second-line dasatinib treatment, 74 (79.6%) carried BCR-ABL KD mutations. Focusing on the interesting
subset of dasatinib-resistant patients who had already been
analyzed at the time of imatinib failure (n 5 68), it was possible to compare BCR-ABL KD mutation status before and
after dasatinib treatment (Fig. 1) and assess the type and
individual frequency of the newly acquired mutations (Fig.
2). At the time of imatinib failure, 53 mutations had been
identified in 47 (69.1%) patients (6 patients had 2 mutations). At the time of dasatinib failure, 46 of 68 (67.6%)
patients were found to have developed new mutations
(including 4 patients with 2 newly acquired mutations and
1 patient with 3 new mutations). Among these, 8 cases had
no previous evidence of mutations, 12 cases showed regression of the preexisting mutation(s), and 26 cases maintained the preexisting mutation(s). As far as the type of
newly acquired mutations is concerned, the T315I mutation was by far the most frequent (it was identified in 30 of
46 patients, 65.2%) followed by the F317L (9 patients,
19.6%), T315A (9 patients, 10.9%), V299L (4 patients,
8.7%), and F317I, F317V, F317C, and E255K (1 patient
each, 2.2%) mutations. Figure 2 details and compares the
KD localization and the relative frequency of mutations
detected at the time of imatinib (Fig. 2A) and dasatinib
(Fig. 2B) resistance. Overall, 30 patients were found to harbor multiple mutations at the time of dasatinib failure: 24
patients had 2 mutations, 5 patients had 3 mutations, and
1 patient had 4 mutations. In 23 patients, a complex clonal

texture with mutations in the same (compound) but also in
separate BCR-ABL transcripts (polyclonality) could be
observed; eg, a patient with E255K and T315I was found
to harbor 3 distinct mutated subclones, one harboring the
E255K (20%), one harboring the T315I (30%), and one
harboring the compound mutant E255K1T315I (50%).
In 51 cases, information on subsequent treatment
and outcome was available. In 21 patients, a third TKI was
administered, chosen mainly upon availability and BCRABL KD mutation status (nilotinib, n 5 13 patients; bosutinib, n 5 3 patients; ponatinib, n 5 5 patients, all positive
for the T315I mutation); 8 patients received other investigational agents (including 6 patients with T315I), 16
patients received chemotherapeutic regimens (including 9
patients with T315I), and 6 patients received best supportive care (including 4 patients with T315I). There were only
transient responses, if any, in the great majority of the cases,
with the notable exception of 2 patients in major cytogenetic response after 6 months on ponatinib.
Mutations in Ph1 ALL Patients Resistant to
First-Line Dasatinib

Fourteen patients included in our database were analyzed
at the time of resistance to dasatinib as first-line therapy.

We hypothesized that this mutation could have been the
T315I that shortly after the start of dasatinib treatment
outgrew and led to resistance. On the other hand, none of
the remaining 17 patients who later developed mutations
had abnormal elution profiles by D-HPLC, not even
those who relapsed shortly after (1-3 months) the start of
TKI treatment, leaving open the question whether these
mutations were already present before the start of treatment below the lower detection limit of D-HPLC (1%10%) or whether they arose and underwent rapid selection during therapy.

Eleven patients (79%) were positive for a BCR-ABL KD
mutation—a T315I mutation in all cases.10
Mutations in Newly Diagnosed Patients With
Ph1 ALL

Finally, we also prospectively analyzed 60 patients with
Ph1 ALL at the time of diagnosis, before the start of any
TKI therapy, in order to assess whether TKI-resistant
mutations could already be detectable by conventional
direct sequencing. This included 25 patients who later
relapsed during imatinib (n 5 15) or dasatinib (n 5 10)
therapy. Eighteen of these patients, analyzed at the time of
relapse (and already described in the sections above) were
found to have developed TKI-resistant mutations.
D-HPLC prescreening showed abnormal elution profiles
in one case only. Subsequent direct sequencing, however,
showed an apparently wild-type KD sequence. Given that
our D-HPLC assay is slightly more sensitive than direct
sequencing,15 it might have picked up a mutation present
just below the lower detection limit of direct sequencing.

DISCUSSION
The main aims of this report were to provide a snapshot of
the overall and individual frequency of BCR-ABL KD
mutations in a large series of patients with Ph1 ALL who
developed resistance to imatinib and to investigate the
changes in mutation frequency and type brought by the
introduction in the therapeutic protocols of secondgeneration TKIs. Although drug resistance and disease recurrence are known to be, by far, more frequent in patients
with Ph1 ALL than in those with CML receiving TKIs,
the great majority of published studies investigating the frequency of BCR-ABL KD mutations has been conducted in
the CML setting or in heterogeneous patient populations,
including both CML cases in various phases of the disease
and Ph1 ALL cases, pooled and analyzed together despite
the profoundly different disease biologies.
Our experience showed that, of 189 imatinibresistant patients referred to our laboratory for BCR-ABL
KD mutation analysis over a period of 9 years, almost 70%
were positive for mutations, which confirms that patients
with Ph1 ALL are highly prone to develop TKI-resistant
mutations and underlines the importance and utility of
BCR-ABL mutation analysis (and possibly, of regular
mutation monitoring) in this specific disease setting.
Our data also revealed that the frequency of individual mutations in Ph1 ALL is different from that of
chronic phase CML patients. The most frequent mutation detectable in Ph1 ALL is T315I (detected in 37% of
all the patients positive for mutations), followed by
E255K, and then by Y253H (18% each) (Table 3). This
is consistent with the earliest reports, dating back to the
phase 2 studies of imatinib in Ph1 ALL, that implicated
T315I and E255K as the main determinants of drug resistance,19 and also with a recent review by Branford et al
who reported their single-institution experience.20 Together, T315I, E255K, and Y253H accounted for threequarters of drug-resistant cases. It is unclear why the same
molecule might be selecting for such different mutation

spectra in different diseases. The higher doses of imatinib
used in Ph1 ALL (600 mg/day and in some cases 800
mg/day, compared against 400 mg/day being the standard
dose for CML in the chronic phase) might concur to select
mutations with higher median inhibitory concentration
(IC50) values, but the fact that a wide spectrum of mutations, not just the 3 mentioned above, can be detected
(including some, such as M244V and M351T, associated
with only modest increase in IC5021) demonstrates that
the dose cannot be the only determinant and the different
biology of the diseases may also play a role. In this regard,
it has been hypothesized that different mechanisms may
sustain genetic instability and/or mutagenesis in lymphoid in contrast to myeloid leukemias. BCR-ABL–
dependent aberrant expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), an enzyme physiologically
involved in immunoglobulin class switch recombination
and somatic hypermutation in germinal center B cells, has
been described in a large proportion of Ph1 ALL and
CML lymphoid blast crises.22 Deregulated AID seems capable of also targeting non-immunoglobulin (non-Ig) loci
and promotes a general state of genetic instability by hypermutation of tumor suppressors (BCL6, MYC, ARF) and
DNA repair genes.23,24 This has led to the hypothesis that
either directly or indirectly, AID may be responsible for the
high frequency of BCR-ABL KD mutations and additional
genetic alterations detectable in Ph1 ALL.22 Intriguingly,
AID is known to introduce C-to-T/G-to-A transitions,25
and the T315I, E255K, and Y253H mutations indeed
result from such type of nucleotide changes (T315I:
ACT>ATT; E255K: GAG>AAG; Y253H: CAT>TAT).
The second-generation TKIs dasatinib and nilotinib
have been evaluated in patients with relapsed/refractory
Ph1 ALL in the framework of phase 1/2 studies,8,9,26,27
although, at present, only dasatinib is approved for the
treatment of this category of patients.18 In addition, both
dasatinib and nilotinib have been10 and are being extensively used in newly diagnosed Ph1 ALL in a number of
clinical trials exploring their use alone or in combination
with chemotherapy, before or after transplant or in the elderly (source: www.clinicaltrials.gov). In imatinibresistant patients who fail dasatinib or nilotinib treatment,
the frequency with which BCR-ABL KD mutations were
detected was even higher (77.6%). In addition, the number of patients who were found to harbor multiple mutations was significantly higher (58% compared with 10%
in imatinib-resistant patients). In 71 cases, matched (imatinib resistance and subsequent-line TKI resistance) samples could be analyzed: this revealed that multiple
mutations more often accumulated because of the

different selective pressure exerted by different TKIs
rather than because distinct clones followed distinct routes
to drug resistance. Compound mutations (ie, when multiple mutations are combined in the same BCR-ABL molecule) have been reported to be particularly difficult to
manage, because they may be associated with enhanced
oncogenic potential and TKI insensitivity than the separate mutants would exhibit.28 Accordingly, patients with
CML who harbor multiple mutations have been shown to
have poor outcomes.29 In the majority of dasatinibresistant patients harboring multiple mutations, however,
clonal analysis showed an ever more complex situation,
with mutations both alone and in combination in distinct
coexisting clones. This is in line with 2 very recent studies
revealing that compound and polyclonal mutations are
not 2 mutually exclusive scenarios.30,31
Despite the different rational considerations and
approaches underlying dasatinib and nilotinib preclinical
development, the T315I mutation unfortunately remains a
common obstacle, together with a few other mutations
that, in contrast, are TKI-specific (T315A, V299L, F317L
and variants for dasatinib; Y253H, E255K/V, F359V and
variants for nilotinib).32-35 In the early days of the secondgeneration TKI era, a certain degree of concern rose that
wider and wider use of second-generation TKIs would
result in an increased frequency of T315I mutation, which
is known to be associated with dismal outcome.36 Our data
suggest that, in the setting of patients with imatinibresistant Ph1 ALL, this may actually be the case. In our experience, 65% (30 of 46) of the patients relapsing on dasatinib after imatinib failure had acquired a T315I mutation
(patients receiving nilotinib were too few for any separate
analysis regarding mutation frequency, although cases
developing a T315I mutation were, obviously, also found
in this setting). Similarly, all 11 of the 14 patients relapsing
on dasatinib as first-line treatment and positive for a mutation had a T315I.10 The high frequency of T315I-positive
cases and/or of cases harboring multiple mutations (with a
high frequency of compound mutants) are probably the
main factors underlying the limited efficacy of subsequent
treatments, although the heterogeneity of the approaches
chosen (and available over the different time periods) for
such a small cohort of patients hampers any prognostic
consideration.
Our experience also showed that in newly diagnosed
patients, mutant clones, if preexisting, rarely achieve
abundance levels such as would allow detection by conventional direct sequencing. With more sensitive methods, detection of TKI-resistant mutations has been
reported in a variable proportion of TKI-naive Ph1 ALL

cases,17,37-39 although not all the small mutant clones
seem capable of expanding.17 Further insights on this
issue, as well as on the optimal lower detection limit to use
to highlight only the clinically relevant emerging mutant
clones are warranted now that ultra-deep sequencing
approaches allowing a sensitive scan of the KD for mutations are becoming available and affordable.31
We acknowledge that our analysis suffers from some
limitations. First, it cannot provide any information on
the frequency of cases developing resistance to imatinib
contrasted to those with second-generation TKIs, because
our data do not come from the analysis of consecutive
patients enrolled in one or more clinical trials, nor from a
single-center experience. Hence, we cannot provide a denominator (number of patients receiving each TKI) for
the number of resistant patients reported here. We also
acknowledge that the patient population under examination is quite heterogeneous in terms of age, therapeutic
protocols, or definition of resistance (the latter ranging
from hematologic recurrence to persistence or recurrence
of disease at the molecular level). On the other hand, to
the best of our knowledge, this is the largest series of
patients with TKI-resistant Ph1 ALL for whom BCRABL KD mutation data have been reported, due to the
fact that our laboratory has served as the reference center
for BCR-ABL KD mutation analysis for almost a decade.
In conclusion, second-generation TKIs may ensure a
more rapid debulking of the leukemic clone and have much
fewer insensitive mutations, but long-term disease control
remains a problem and the T315I mutation has become an
even tougher enemy because its frequency has increased,
reducing the number of (currently available) therapeutic
options. Patients with Ph1 ALL are thus those who might
benefit most from ponatinib, a third-generation, pan-TKI
active against T315I BCR-ABL mutant approved for the
treatment of patients resistant or intolerant CML and Ph1
ALL by the US Food and Drug Administration just a few
months ago.40 The use of ponatinib alone or in combination
with chemotherapy is also being explored in phase 2 clinical
trials in patients with de novo Ph1 ALL (NCT01641107;
NCT01424982); results are eagerly awaited.
