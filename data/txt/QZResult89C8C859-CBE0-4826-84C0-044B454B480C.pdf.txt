Abstract
Hyperthermia is a potent sensitizer of cell killing by ionizing
radiation (IR); however, hyperthermia also induces heat shock
protein 70 (HSP70) synthesis and HSP70 expression is associated with radioresistance. Because HSP70 interacts with
the telomerase complex and expression of the telomerase
catalytic unit (hTERT) extends the life span of the human
cells, we determined if heat shock influences telomerase
activity and whether telomerase inhibition enhances heatmediated IR-induced cell killing. In the present study, we show
that moderate hyperthermia (43°C) enhances telomerase activity. Inhibition of telomerase activity with human telomerase
RNA–targeted antisense agents, and in particular GRN163L,
results in enhanced hyperthermia-mediated IR-induced cell
killing, and ectopic expression of catalytic unit of telomerase (TERT) decreased hyperthermia-mediated IR-induced cell
killing. The increased cell killing by heat and IR exposure in
telomerase-inhibited cells correlates with delayed appearance
and disappearance of ;-H2AX foci as well as decreased
chromosome repair. These results suggest that inactivation
of telomerase before combined hyperthermia and radiotherapy could improve tumor killing. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3370–8]

Introduction
Telomerase is a unique ribonucleoprotein enzyme that is
responsible for adding the telomeric repeats onto the 3¶ ends of
chromosomes (1). Besides the obvious role of telomerase in
telomere synthesis and DNA damage repair (2, 3), functions for
telomerase in response to stress are unknown. A common cellular
stress is exposure to elevated temperatures (4, 5). Hyperthermia
itself has several cellular effects that have been proposed to be
synergistic with ionizing radiation (IR)-induced tumor cell killing
(5). For example, hypoxic cells are more resistant to IR-induced cell
killing in comparison with normoxic cells, although hypoxic cells
are no more resistant to heat-induced cell lethality than are normoxic cells (6). Hyperthermic cell stress activates a highly conserved program of rapid alterations in normal cellular metabolism
to optimize synthesis of a limited, specific set of proteins known
as heat shock proteins (HSP). The most highly induced and conserved HSP in all organisms from Escherichia coli to man is HSP70

(3). The evolutionarily conserved members of the HSP70 family
prevent the disruption of normal cellular processes that involve
mitosis, meiosis, or differentiation by environmental stressors
(7, 8). Members of the HSP70 family play essential roles in preventing misfolding and aggregation of newly synthesized or
unfolded proteins (9–11). Although HSP70 is known to interact
with the telomerase complex, it is not known whether inactivation
of HSP70 can influence cell killing in the presence and absence of
telomerase by IR especially when treatment is combined with
hyperthermia.
The inability of current radiotherapies to control tumor growth
is still a daunting clinical problem leading to failure of the overall
treatment regimens. Therapeutic agents that are currently used to
enhance radiosensitivity lack specificity for tumor cells and, therefore, have therapy-limiting toxic side effects for normal tissue.
Cancer treatment could be improved by the development of drugs
that target specific pathways that are deregulated in tumor cells.
A fundamental unanswered question is if tumor cells can be
specifically sensitized to IR by heat or factors exclusively expressed
in tumor cells. One such factor, expressed in most tumors and
silent in most human somatic cells, is telomerase. Telomerase
activity has been found in approximately 85% to 90% of all human
tumors but not in the adjacent normal cells (12, 13). Biochemical
and genetic studies have established an association between
telomere maintenance and extended life span of human cells
mediated through the expression of the catalytic subunit of
telomerase (hTERT). Because of this, telomerase is an attractive target for inhibition in anticancer therapy. In the present study,
we show that acute hyperthermia results in loss of telomerase enzyme activity, whereas moderate hyperthermia slightly enhanced telomerase activity. Whether the increase in telomerase
activity by moderate heat shock may contribute to thermoresistant
is not known. Because hyperthermia is used clinically in combination with radiation, the present study also tested whether
inactivation of telomerase with human telomerase RNA (hTR)directed antisense agents could enhance hyperthermia-mediated
radiosensitization.

Materials and Methods
Human cell lines used were 293, HeLa, GM857, and primary fibroblast
cell lines (GM5823, HFF, and BJ) with their corresponding stably transfected
hTERT counterparts (GM5823+hTERT, BJ+hTERT, and HFF+hTERT) as
described previously (8, 14). Terc-null and Tert-null mouse embryonic cells
along with their wild-type counterparts were obtained from Sandy Change
(M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) and Fuyuki Ishikawa (Kyoto
University, Kyoto, Japan), respectively, and details about the cell lines and
culture conditions have been described previously (15, 16). Mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) with and without Hsp70.1/3 (Hsp70.1/3+/+
and Hsp70.1/3/) as well as mouse kidney fibroblasts with and without
ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) were maintained as described

previously (4). A-TLD1 cells were maintained as described (17). Heat shock
treatments were carried out at 43jC for different time periods as shown in
the respective figures. The acute heat shock treatments were carried out at
45jC and higher.
Telomerase inhibitors. Three types of hTR-targeted antisense agents
were investigated (Fig. 3A). The first type of agent was the previously
reported mixed DNA/locked nucleic acid (LNA) oligomer, d(CAGttAGGGTtAG), where the LNA component is shown in lower case and which was
transfected into cells via Lipofectamine 2000 (18). The second type of agent
investigated was a series of cell-penetrating peptide-peptide nucleic acid
(PNA) conjugates, which used the same sequence as the LNA (Supplementary Table S1) and which were transfected into cells by simple incubation.
These peptide-PNA conjugates were synthesized by standard automated
Fmoc synthesis on an ABI Expedite 8909 DNA/PNA synthesizer with
D-amino acids to enhance stability in vivo, purified by reverse-phase highperformance liquid chromatography, and characterized by matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time of flight (Supplementary Table S1). The
third type of agent was a recently reported phospholipid (PL) derivative of
the thiophosphoramidate GRN163, GRN163L (5¶-PL-TAGGGTTAGACAA-3¶),
and its mismatch mutant (5¶-PL-TAGGTGTAAGCAA-3¶; ref. 19). Lipid
modification of GRN163L has been shown to enhance the potency of
telomerase inhibition (19). Cells were treated as previously described,
showing that the GRN163L mismatch mutant had no effect on telomerase
activity (20). GRN163L inhibits telomerase activity in various tumor cell
lines with IC50 values of 3 to 300 nmol/L without any cellular uptake
enhancers and has potent and sequence-specific anticancer activity in vivo
in multiple animal models. In addition, GRN163L significantly affects not
only the growth of primary tumors but also the spread and proliferation of
metastases.
Survival assay. Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes in 5.0 mL of medium,
incubated for 6 h, and subsequently exposed to IR as described previously
(21). The number of cells plated per dish was selected to ensure that f50
colonies would survive treatment of a specific radiation dose. Cells were
exposed to IR in a dose range of 0 to 6 Gy at room temperature. Cells were
incubated for 12 or more days and then fixed in methanol-acetic acid (3:1)
before staining with crystal violet. Only colonies containing at least 50 cells
were counted.
Telomerase assay. Telomerase activity was determined using telomerase
PCR ELISA kit (Roche Diagnostic Corp.) as described (22). Telomerase
activity was determined in triplicate, with negative and positive controls
run for each experiment. As a negative control, an aliquot of each extract
was heat inactivated for 10 min at 95jC.
;-H2AX immunofluorescence measurements. Cells were cultured
on chamber slides, fixed, and immunostained as described previously
(5, 23–25). Fluorescence images of foci were captured using a Zeiss
Axioskop 2 epifluorescent microscope equipped with a charge-coupled
device camera and ISIS software (Metasystems). Optical sections through
nuclei were captured, and images were obtained by projection of the
individual sections as described recently (23). The results shown are from
three independent experiments. Cells with bubble-like appearance or
micronuclei were not considered for g-H2AX analysis.
Chromosomal DNA strand break analysis. Cell-based analysis of
individual chromosome damage provides the most sensitive assay for
determining the induction of DNA strand breaks after stress. To determine
whether telomerase inhibitors enhanced chromosomal break formation,
cells were treated with GRN163L before heat shock and IR exposure.
Immediately after IR exposure, cells were treated with colcemid and
chromosome aberrations were assessed by counting chromatid breaks and
gaps per cell as described (4, 26–29). Two hundred metaphases were
analyzed for each point.

Results
Effect of heat shock on cellular telomerase activity. Heat
shock treatment is known to induce HSP70, which interacts with
the catalytic unit of telomerase (hTERT), whose expression extends
the life span of the cells (14, 30). Therefore, we first determined

www.aacrjournals.org

whether hyperthermia influences telomerase activity in tumorderived and normal cell lines. Exponentially growing (293, HeLa,
and BJ+hTERT) cells were kept at 41jC, 43jC, 45jC, and 47jC for
1 h and then examined for telomerase activity (Fig. 1A; data not
shown). Cells treated with heat at 41jC did not show any change
in basal (37jC) telomerase activity (data not shown). Maximum
telomerase activity was observed in cells heat shocked at 43jC,
whereas acute heat shock of 45jC or above resulted in decreased
telomerase activity (Fig. 1A; data not shown). HeLa as well as 293
cells showed the maximum enhancement of telomerase activity
within 1 h of heat treatment at 43jC (Fig. 1B, a). Such heatenhanced telomerase activity is statistically significant as determined by Student’s t test (P < 0.05). A modest increase in
telomerase activity was observed in ectopically expressed hTERT in
cells with ATM function (BJ+hTERT) and without ATM function
(GM5823+hTERT). The increase in telomerase activity after heat
shock was followed by a gradual decrease in telomerase activity
during recovery period (Fig. 1B, a). Heat shock treatment did
not induce any telomerase activity in primary fibroblast cells (HFF
and GM5823) or in cells with alternative lengthening of telomeres
(ALT; GM847). To determine whether the change in telomerase
activity was due to altered transcription, we examined the levels
of hTERT and hTR RNA by reverse transcription-PCR. We found
that heat treatment did not change the mRNA levels of hTERT
or hTR (data not shown) and protein levels of hTERT (Fig. 1B, b).
Inactivation of HSP70 slightly reduced the effect on heat
shock–enhanced telomerase activity. HSP70 has been shown to
interact with hTERT before its assembly with hTR and other
telomerase protein components (31). Although the association of
HSP70 with TERT is not required for the functional activity of
hTERT in vitro (31), total cellular inactivation of HSP70 does result
in reduced basal level telomerase activity in mouse embryonic cells
(4). To determine whether inactivation of HSP70 influences heatinduced telomerase activity, we compared telomerase activity
in MEFs with and without HSP70 (4) after heat shock at 43jC.
Although heat shock treatment transiently increased telomerase
activity in both Hsp70.1/3+/+ and Hsp70.1/3/ cells (Fig. 1C), there
was a modestly greater enhancement of telomerase activity in
Hsp70.1/3+/+ cells.
Effect of in vitro heating on telomerase activity. Cells
exposed to moderate heat shock (43jC) show a transient increase
in telomerase activity (Fig. 1B, a and C). We tested whether the
heat-induced increase in telomerase activity is a direct effect of
heat on the telomerase complex. Cell extracts were treated with
different temperatures (37jC, 43jC, and 47jC) for 1 h and
examined for telomerase activity. A significant drop in telomerase
activity was observed at 43jC (P < 0.05, Student’s t test) and an
even larger decrease was seen at 47jC (P < 0.001, Student’s t test;
Fig. 1D, a). We next determined if heat shock treatment of cell
extracts followed by incubation at 37jC influences the telomerase
activity. Therefore, we immunoprecipitated the telomerase complex from 293 cellular extracts by anti-hTERT antibody. Both the
cellular extract and immunoprecipitated telomerase complex
were heated for 1 h at 43jC and then incubated at 37jC. In contrast to the transient increase in telomerase activity observed in
heat shock–treated cells, a modest decrease in telomerase activity
was observed in heat shock–treated cell extracts or immunoprecipitated telomerase complex (Fig. 1D, b). Similar results were
obtained when ectopically expressed hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged
hTERT was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody from BJ
cell extracts, heated, and analyzed for telomerase activity (data not

Figure 2. Influence of ectopic hTERT expression on cell survival after heat, IR, and heat + IR treatment. Cells were subjected to heat treatment at 43jC for 30 min
and then irradiated with different doses of IR. A, dose-response curves are shown for cells with (BJ) and without (GM5823) ATM, and their isogenic cells with and
without ectopically expressing hTERT. Telomerase-expressing cells were less sensitive to cell killing by heat + IR than their counterparts, and the differences are
significant (P < 0.05, Student’s t test). B, comparison of cell survival after heat shock and IR exposure in mouse embryonic cells with and without Tert or Terc. The

shown). These results suggest that the transient increase in telomerase activity observed in cells after heat shock is not the direct
consequences of the effect of heat on the telomerase complex.
Influence of hTERT on heat- and IR-induced cell killing.
Ectopic expression of hTERT in telomerase-silent cells is sufficient
to overcome senescence by extending cellular life span (13, 14,
30, 32, 33). This leads to transcriptional alterations in a subset of
genes and changes the interaction of telomeres with the nuclear
matrix (2, 34). These alterations are associated with a reduction in
spontaneous chromosome damage, enhancement of DNA repair
kinetics, and increased nucleotide triphosphate levels (2). These
effects of hTERT have been reported to occur rapidly before any
significant lengthening of telomeres was observed (2, 34). Such
functions of telomerase are distinct from its known effect on
telomere length and have potentially important biological consequences. The present studies revealed that moderate heating
enhances telomerase activity, suggesting that telomerase may have
a role in cellular protection during stress conditions. Because heat
shock has been shown to activate ATM independent of DNA
double-strand breaks (5), we therefore analyzed whether the presence of hTERT with or without ATM has any influence on heatmediated IR-induced cell killing.
Cells deficient in ATM function are more sensitive to IRinduced cell killing compared with cells with normal ATM

function. Both parental and hTERT-expressing fibroblasts with
(BJ) and without (GM5823) ATM were exposed to heat at 43jC for
30 min followed by various doses of IR exposure. Cell colonies
were scored and plotted against the radiation dose (Fig. 2A).
Ectopically expressing hTERT cells with (BJ+hTERT) and without
(GM5823+hTERT) ATM exhibited an increased survival after
heat shock treatment compared with cells without hTERT
expression (BJ and GM5823). Interestingly, ATM-deficient cells
with ectopic expression of hTERT (GM5823+hTERT) had a higher
survival after heat and IR exposure than ATM-deficient cells
without hTERT expression (GM5823). These results show that
expression of telomerase does significantly (P < 0.05, Student’s t
test) reduce heat-mediated IR-induced cell killing in both cells
with and without ATM, although the effect of heat on cells
deficient in ATM was more dramatic. These results further
support the argument that the presence of telomerase influences
heat-mediated radiosensitization.
Inactivation of telomerase enhances heat- and IR-induced
cell killing. We next tested whether genetic inactivation as well
transient inactivation of telomerase influences heat-mediated
IR-induced cell killing. Because telomerase activation has been
linked with extension of cell life span (14, 33), it is possible that
inactivation of telomerase may enhance cell death after heat and
IR exposure. To determine the role of telomerase activity in cell

activity after heat shock in cells, cell extracts, and immunoprecipitated telomerase after heat shock at 43jC for 1 h followed by incubation at 37jC for different time

activity after 1 h was significant compared with control (P < 0.05, Student’s t test).

killing, we compared MEFs with deletion of the telomerase
catalytic unit (Tert) or RNA component (Terc) to wild-type
fibroblasts to determine if telomerase inactivation increased
sensitivity to heat and IR exposure. Mouse embryonic cells with
and without mTert or mTerc were treated with heat at 43jC for 30
min followed by irradiation with different doses and examined for
clonogenic survival (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, cells deficient for Tert
or Terc had increased (P < 0.05, Student’s t test) heat-mediated IRinduced cell killing compared with their wild-type control cells.
The above results suggest that the presence of Tert or Terc plays a
role in heat-mediated IR-induced cell killing, and therefore, we
further tested whether transient inactivation of telomerase activity
would induce a similar sensitivity. hTR contains an 11-nucleotidelong template region for binding to and extending telomeric
substrates that is easily accessible for hybridization with
complementary oligonucleotides. Thus, hTR represents an attractive target for oligonucleotide-based anti-telomerase therapies
(35). We tested several classes of telomerase inhibitors, including
PNAs, LNAs, and thiophosphoramidates (GRN163L; Fig. 3A;
Supplementary Fig. S1), to determine whether these treatments
could inhibit telomerase activity and enhance heat-mediated IRinduced cell killing. A series of cell-penetrating peptide-PNA
conjugates specific for hTR (Supplementary Table S1) were
synthesized and tested for inhibition of telomerase activity in
293 cells. After 24 h of PNA treatment, we found that 1 Amol/L
hTR13-R9 produced the maximum inhibition of telomerase
activity, whereas treatment concentrations >1 Amol/L decreased
cell viability (Supplementary Fig. S1A; data not shown), in general
agreement with another study using cell-penetrating peptide-PNA
conjugates (36). We further compared the inhibition of telomerase
activity at <1 Amol/L of PNA hTR13-R9, LNA, and GRN163L in
cells treated for 24, 48, and 72 h (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Fig. S1B–
D). At all time points examined, we found that GRN163L was

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

more effective in inhibiting telomerase activity than PNA or LNA.
After 72 h, only GRN163L treatment resulted in almost complete
inhibition of telomerase activity, whereas LNA produced 80%
inhibition and PNA resulted in 38% inhibition (Fig. 3B).
To determine the effect of PNA-, LNA-, and GRN163L-induced
telomerase inhibition on IR-induced and heat + IR–induced cell
killing, 293 cells were treated with 1 Amol/L of PNA, LNA/
Lipofectamine, or GRN163L for 72 h and then either heated at
43jC for 30 min and irradiated with different graded IR doses or
irradiated only. Cells pretreated with GRN163L followed by
exposure to heat and IR showed maximum killing, whereas cells
pretreated with LNAs were less sensitive and PNA-treated cells
were the least sensitive (Fig. 4A). Overall, these results correlate
with individual ability of the three agents to inhibit telomerase
activity. To determine whether GRN163L treatment enhances heatmediated IR-induced cell killing in cells without telomerase activity,
isogenic cells with respect to telomerase BJ (telomerase negative)
and BJ+hTERT (telomerase positive) and ALT cells (GM857;
telomerase negative) were treated with 1 Amol/L GRN163L for
72 h and then either first heated at 43jC for 30 min and irradiated
with different graded doses of IR or irradiated only. No major
difference in the heat-mediated IR-induced cell killing was observed
in BJ or GM857 cells (both lack telomerase activity) with or without
GRN163L treatment; however, a significant (P < 0.05, Student’s t
test) difference in heat-mediated IR-induced cell killing was
observed in GRN163L-treated BJ+hTERT cells than untreated
BJ+hTERT cells (Fig. 4B and C). Such studies suggest that
telomerase activity may protect against heat-mediated IR-induced
cell killing.
Our previous results have shown that inactivation of Hsp70.1/3
resulted in decreased telomerase activity (4); we therefore tested
whether inactivation of telomerase in Hsp70.1/3-null cells would
have any additional effect on cell killing after heat shock and IR

exposure. As we reported previously (4), when heat shock is
followed by IR exposure, there is a significant increase in cell killing
in both cells with and without Hsp70.1/3; however, Hsp70.1/3-null
cells are more sensitive to IR or heat + IR treatments (Fig. 4D).

In IR-exposed cells, there was no effect of telomerase inhibition on
cell survival after irradiation in either wild-type or Hsp70.1/3-null
cells. In contrast, when cells were first treated with GRN163L
followed by heat and IR exposure, there was a modest decrease in

cell survival in Hsp70.1/3-null cells and a more significant decrease
in Hsp70.1/3 wild-type cell survival (P < 0.05, Student’s t test).
It is important to note that the overall sensitivity of Hsp70.1/3-null
cells to IR exposure or heat + IR exposure was f9-fold greater,
which may account for the lesser effect of telomerase inhibition in
Hsp70.1/3-null cells.
Inactivation of telomerase activity results in the delayed
disappearance of ;-H2AX foci formed following heat or IR
treatment. The above results suggest that telomerase activity

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

influences heat-mediated IR-induced cell killing. We have recently
shown that hyperthermia induces g-H2AX foci formation similar
to foci formed in response to IR exposure and that heat-induced
g-H2AX foci formation is dependent on ATM but independent of
HSP70 expression (5). Hyperthermia also enhanced ATM kinase
activity and increased cellular ATM autophosphorylation. Because
telomerase activity has also been shown to influence DNA damage
repair (2, 37), we therefore examined whether telomerase activity
influences heat shock–induced g-H2AX foci formation. This was

achieved by examining heat-mediated g-H2AX foci formation in (a)
human cells with and without ectopic expression of hTERT, (b)
mouse cells with and without mTert or mTerc, and (c) cells treated
or not with GRN163L to inhibit the telomerase activity. To determine the effect of telomerase activity on heat-induced g-H2AX
foci formation, cells were subjected to a 30-min heat shock at
43jC and then allowed to recover at 37jC for various lengths of
time. Immediately following heat treatment, the number of g-H2AX
foci increased in control cells to between 34 and 45 per cell and this
number declined substantially during the 720-min recovery period
at 37jC (Fig. 5A and B; data not shown). There was a modest
decrease in g-H2AX foci formation in heated telomerase-deficient
cells (Fig. 5A and B); however, these foci persisted significantly
(P < 0.05, Student’s t test) longer than those formed in cells with
telomerase activity. Heat, therefore, leads to g-H2AX foci formation irrespective of telomerase activity; however, cells deficient
in telomerase activity have relatively delayed disappearance of
g-H2AX foci formation. To determine whether hyperthermia also
modulates IR-induced g-H2AX foci, cells were first treated with
GRN163L as described above and then heated at 43jC for 30 min
followed by incubation at 37jC. Cells with telomerase activity
treated with GRN163L formed fewer foci per cell compared with
untreated cells (Fig. 5B; data not shown). Interestingly, the
appearance of heat-induced g-H2AX foci in GRN163L-treated cells
was influenced by hyperthermia as well as IR exposure (Fig. 5B and
C), arguing that telomerase activity does influence heat-induced
stress responses. Because GRN163L treatment resulted in the
delayed appearance of heat-induced g-H2AX foci formation, we
further evaluated whether GRN163L influences DNA repair after
heat and IR exposure. To determine whether GRN163L treatment
results in higher residual chromosome damage, we examined cells
with and without treatment with GRN163L for chromosome
aberrations at metaphase. We did not find any differences in
spontaneous chromosome aberration levels in cells with and
without treatment with GRN163L for 72 h (Fig. 5D). However, cells
treated with GRN163L had higher chromosome aberration levels
after heat and IR exposure compared with cells not treated with
GRN163L (Fig. 5D).

Discussion
Hyperthermia is a potent radiosensitizer currently under clinical
investigation as a means to improve the response to IR-based cancer treatments (3). Hyperthermia itself has several cellular effects
that should be synergistic with IR-induced tumor cell killing
(30, 38). For example, unlike the IR response (6), neither hypoxic nor
plateau-phase cells are resistant to heat-induced cell killing (39).
Because phase III clinical trials have shown significant benefits from
adding hyperthermia to radiotherapy regimens for several malignancies (40), it is important to understand the mechanism leading

to enhanced tumor cell killing. Telomerase is present in most
tumors and has been shown to interact with HSP70, a protective
protein up-regulated by hyperthermia that maintains protein
function and inhibits apoptotic cell death under stress conditions.
We have reported that loss of HSP70 expression in mouse
fibroblasts (Hsp70.1/3/) is associated with decreased telomerase
activity as well as increased heat shock + IR–induced cell killing
(4). These observations are consistent with a previous report
that telomerase plays a critical role in cellular metabolism (2).
The present studies show that moderate heat shock enhances
telomerase activity, and inactivation of telomerase activity before
heat shock and irradiation enhances cell death specifically in
telomerase-positive cells. This suggests that telomerase activity
is part of an unknown mechanism that contributes to the cellprotective stress response.
Previous studies have shown that ectopic expression of hTERT
enhances DNA repair and stabilizes the genome (2). In the present
study, inactivation of telomerase was found in the present study to
delay the appearance and disappearance of g-H2AX foci following
hyperthermia and irradiation, an indication of defective signaling
during the DNA damage response. Interestingly, telomerase-positive
cells treated with GRN163L show higher chromosome aberrations
after heat and IR exposure compared with untreated control cells,
whereas cells without telomerase activity did not show any
difference in chromosome aberrations between treated versus
untreated cells, further supporting a relationship between telomerase inactivation and heat-mediated IR-induced cell killing.
We used multiple approaches to determine the effect of telomerase inactivation on heat- and IR-induced cell killing. Interestingly,
heat does not induce any telomerase activity in primary fibroblasts
(BJ or GM5823) and, when treated with telomerase inhibitors, did
not show any major influence on clonogenic survival after heat
shock and IR treatments compared with the telomerase-positive
cells (Fig. 2A). Collectively, our data suggest that inactivation of
telomerase activity enhances heat-mediated IR-induced cell killing
in telomerase-positive cells. Based on our present finding that
telomerase has some additional functions for cell survival besides
its role in telomere maintenance (2, 13), the inactivation of
telomerase has a great potential for enhancing heat shock–induced
and IR-induced cell killing of telomerase-positive tumor cells.
