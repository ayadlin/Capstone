BACKGROUND: Although fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, and anxiety are associated with pain in breast cancer patients, it is
unknown whether acupuncture can decrease these comorbid symptoms in cancer patients with pain. The objective of this study was
to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) on fatigue, sleep, and psychological distress in breast cancer survivors who experience joint pain related to aromatase inhibitors (AIs). METHODS: The authors performed a randomized controlled trial of an 8-week
course of EA compared with a waitlist control (WLC) group and a sham acupuncture (SA) group in postmenopausal women with
breast cancer who self-reported joint pain attributable to AIs. Fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression were measured
using the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS). The effects of EA and SA versus WLC on these outcomes were evaluated using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Of the 67
randomly assigned patients, baseline pain interference was associated with fatigue (Pearson correlation coefficient [r]50.75;
P < .001), sleep disturbance (r50.38; P5.0026), and depression (r50.58; P < .001). Compared with the WLC condition, EA produced
significant improvements in fatigue (P5.0095), anxiety (P5.044), and depression (P5.015) and a nonsignificant improvement in sleep
disturbance (P5.058) during the 12-week intervention and follow-up period. In contrast, SA did not produce significant reductions in
fatigue or anxiety symptoms but did produce a significant improvement in depression compared with the WLC condition (P5.0088).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with usual care, EA produced significant improvements in fatigue, anxiety, and depression; whereas SA

INTRODUCTION
Arthralgia, or joint pain, is a common and bothersome side effect of aromatase inhibitors (AIs)1 experienced by nearly
50% of postmenopausal breast cancer patients who receive AI therapies.2 Among all of the side effects associated with AIs,
arthralgia is the most discussed symptom in online, breast cancer-specific message boards, which indicates the intrusive nature of this symptom on patients’ daily living.3 Furthermore, the experience of arthralgia results in premature discontinuation of AIs,4 which may negatively impact disease-free and overall breast cancer survival.5
Emerging evidence suggests that acupuncture, a therapy originated from traditional Chinese medicine, may be effective
in the management of AI-related arthralgia.6-8 Acupuncture appears to be safe, and few minor and self-limiting side effects
(eg, needling pain, local bruising) have been noticed in the trials. Although the definitive efficacy of acupuncture for arthralgia
related to AI use requires rigorously conducted trials of larger sample sizes, longer follow-up, and refinement of active and placebo interventions, the initial effect sizes observed in these trials indicate potentially clinically meaningful reduction in pain.6,8
Although it is not established in the setting of AI therapy, research has demonstrated that pain in patients with
breast cancer is often associated with fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression.9-12 Biologically, the clustering
of these symptoms with pain may be explained by hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) dysregulation.11 In addition, the dynamic correlation between innate immune inflammatory responses and
neuroendocrine pathways may account for both the development and the persistence of these symptoms.13 Together,

pain and comorbid nonpain symptoms have a synergistic
negative effect on quality of life in breast cancer
patients.10 In animal models, acupuncture impacts both
the HPA axis14 and the SNS system,15 providing a biologically plausible explanation for acupuncture’s effect
on not only AI-related arthralgia but also on fatigue,
sleep, and psychological distress in these women. We analyzed prespecified, secondary, nonpain symptom outcomes in a recently completed phase 2, randomized
controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the short-term effects
and safety of electroacupuncture (EA) for AI-related
arthralgia compared with a sham acupuncture (SA) placebo and usual care (waitlist control [WLC]).8 We chose
EA because of its clear physiologic effect on the endogenous opioid system (eg, enkaphalin and b-endorphin)
and pain reduction demonstrated in animal models.16
For the current article, we evaluated the specific effects of
EA and SA compared with usual care WLC on fatigue,
sleep, anxiety, and depression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We previously published primary outcomes from our
clinical trial demonstrating the preliminary efficacy of EA
on AI-related pain.8 We summarize the methods here for
convenience. This study is registered as a National Clinical Trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT01013337).
Study Participants

In brief, we conducted a 3-arm RCT (EA, SA, and
WLC) from September 2009 through May 2012 at
the Abramson Cancer Center of the Hospital of the
University of Pennsylvania, a tertiary care academic
medical center in Philadelphia. Eligible patients were
women with a history of early stage breast cancer
(stages I-III) who were currently receiving an AI (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane), had joint pain for at
least 3 months that they attributed to their AI,
reported a worst pain rating 4 on an 11-point numerical rating scale (from 0 to 10) in the preceding
week, reported at least 15 days with pain in the preceding 30 days, and provided informed consent. We
excluded individuals who had metastatic (stage IV)
breast cancer or who had a history of a bleeding disorder. The institutional review board of the University of
Pennsylvania approved the study protocol.

ensure a 2:1 randomization of acupuncture to WLC. Subsequently, for the acupuncture group, the treating acupuncturist opened a second envelope using computergenerated numbers at the first acupuncture visit to determine whether the participant was to receive EA or SA. We
educated all participants on joint pain, staying physically
active, and continuing with current medical treatments
(including prescription and over-the-counter pain medications) as usual. Patients in the WLC group were allowed
to receive 10 real acupuncture treatments after 12 weeks
of follow-up. Blinding was evaluated by credibility rating
at week 8, as previously reported. Participants indicated
that they considered both EA and SA to be credible (pain
rating, 4.3 vs 4.0, respectively; P5.54).8
Interventions

Two licensed, nonphysician acupuncturists with 8 years
and 20 years of experience, respectively, administered
interventions twice weekly for 2 weeks, then weekly for 6
more weeks, for a total of 10 treatments over 8 weeks. The
detailed protocol has been previously published.8 In brief,
for the EA group, the acupuncturist chose at least 4 local
points around the joint with the most pain. In addition, at
least 4 distant points were used to address nonpain symptoms (eg, depression/anxiety and fatigue) commonly
observed in conjunction with pain. The needles (30 mm
or 40 mm and 0.25 gauge; Seirin-America Inc., Weymouth, Mass) were inserted until “De Qi” (sensation of
soreness, tingling, etc) was reported by the patient.17 Two
pairs of electrodes were connected at the needles adjacent
to the painful joint(s) with 2-hertz electrostimulation provided by a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
(TENS) unit. The needles were left in place for 30
minutes with brief manipulation at the beginning and the
end of therapy. SA was performed using Streitberger nonpenetrating needles at nonacupuncture, nontrigger points
at least 5 cm from the joint where pain was perceived to be
maximal. The acupuncturists avoided eliciting the “De
Qi” sensations by only minimally manipulating the needles apart from their initial contact with the skin. Instead
of adding a small electric current to the needles, the acupuncturists turned on the dial of the TENS unit to a different channel so that the participant could observe the
light blinking without receiving the electricity. The frequency and duration of treatments between EA and SA
groups were identical.

patient-reported outcomes of fatigue, sleep, and psychological distress, were measured at baseline; at weeks
2, 4, and 8 during treatment; and at week 12 (4 weeks
after treatment). We measured fatigue using the summative score of the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI). This
9-item instrument was designed to assess 1 construct
of fatigue severity in cancer and noncancer populations19 on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 to
10, with 10 indicating the greatest severity or interference. The score of the scale has been identified as reliable and valid in multiple languages and diverse cancer

on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The
19-item PSQI instrument produces a global sleepquality score and 7 specific component scores: quality,
latency, duration, disturbance, habitual sleep efficiency,
use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction.
Global scores range from 0 to 21, with higher scores
indicating poor sleep quality and high sleep disturbance.20 Psychological distress was measured using the

Statistical Analysis

We based sample size estimations for this study on the primary outcome of pain. To detect an effect size of 1.6 at
80% power and a significance level of .05, we needed 18
participants per arm.8 We used an analysis of variance or
the Pearson chi-square test to compare baseline variables
among groups. To evaluate whether the nonpain patientreported outcomes were associated with pain intensity and
interference, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) among those outcomes at baseline. Because our
outcome measures were repeated over time, we assessed
differences in changes from baseline to week 12 between
EA and WLC and between SA and WLC using separate
mixed-effects models.23 We treated time and group as categorical variables and included a random intercept term in
the mixed-effects model with adjustment for baseline valCancer

ues. Tests of intention-to-treat differences between the EA
and WLC arms and between the SA and WLC arms with
respect to changes were based on time-intervention interactions in the mixed-effects models. We calculated P values both for joint tests across all time points and for
individual tests at each time point. We checked the goodness of fit of the mixed-effects models using residual plots.
We did not observe any evidence for violations of any
model assumptions or lack of fit. The impact of missing
data on the results was evaluated through sensitivity analyses, including last observation carry forward and analyses
of completers only, and none of the results differed from
our intent-to-treat analyses. We calculated between-group
differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) at each
time point. Two-sided P values are presented and interpreted at a statistical significance level of .05. Statistical
analyses were conducted using STATA (version 12.0;
STATA Corporation, College Station, Tex) and SAS (version 9.2l SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
We screened 159 patients and enrolled 76 between September 2009 and May 2012, as previously reported8 (for a
Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials [CONSORT]
diagram of the study, see Fig. 1). Of the 76 patients who
qualified for baseline evaluation, 9 were further excluded (7
had patient-reported pain levels lower than the inclusion criteria, 1 had severe pain unrelated to AIs, and another did
not want to participate), and the 67 eligible participants
were randomly assigned to EA, SA, or WLC. Among these
participants, 21 (95.4%) in the EA group and 20 (90.5%)
in the SA group received all 10 treatments. Of all randomized participants, 4 (6%) were lost to follow-up before week
8, and 8 (12%) were lost to follow-up before week 12.8

Baseline Patient Characteristics

Table 1 provides baseline data for the 67 participants. The
mean age of the women enrolled was 59.7 years (range,
41-76 years). There were 48 white women (71.6%) and
16 black women (23.9%). Forty-four patients (66%)
were receiving anastrozole at the time of randomization,
and, on average, participants had been on an AI for 25.9
months (range, 3-56 months). The mean6standard deviation BPI pain intensity score at baseline was 4.961.6,
and the pain-related interference score was 3.762.2. The
mean BFI score was 3.762.4, the mean PSQI score was

Baseline Correlation Between Pain and Nonpain
Symptoms

At baseline, we observed significant correlations between
pain and several nonpain symptoms. Fatigue (r 5 0.54;
P < .001), sleep disturbances (r 5 0.28; P 5 .025), and
depression (r50.35; P5.0037) were associated with pain
intensity. Fatigue (r50.75; P<.001), sleep disturbances
(r50.38; P5.0026), and depression (r50.58; P<.001)
also were associated with pain-related interference. Anxiety
was not associated with either pain intensity (r50.059;
P5.64) or pain interference (r50.20; P5.099).
Changes in Fatigue, Sleep, and Psychological
Distress

Table 2 and Figure 2 provide data on the changes in fatigue, sleep, anxiety, and depression at weeks 4, 8, and 12
compared with baseline among 3 treatment groups.

In the mixed-effects models, compared with WLC, both
EA and SA produced nonsignificant improvements in the
PSQI score over time (P5.058 and P5.31, respectively).
Compared with the WLC arm, patients in the EA arm had
a nonsignificant improvement in the PSQI score at week 8
(21.5; 95% CI, 23.5 to 0.4; P5.087; Cohen d50.63).
Anxiety

In the mixed-effects models, compared with WLC, EA produced a significant improvement in the HADS-Anxiety
score over time (P5.044) whereas SA did not (P5.91).
Compared with the WLC arm, patients in the EA arm had
nonsignificant improvement in the HADS-Anxiety score at
week 8 (21.3 points; 95% CI, 23.1 to 0.5; P5.075; Cohen
d50.53). The change in HADS-Anxiety score was increased
and significant between the EA and WLC arms by week 12
(22.2; 95% CI, 24.3 to 20.1; P5.006; Cohen d50.68).

Fatigue

In the mixed-effects models, EA produced a significant
improvement in the BFI score compared with WLC over
time (P5.0095), whereas SA did not produce an improvement (P5.18). Compared with the WLC arm, patients in
the EA arm had a greater reduction in the BFI score at week
8 (mean difference in reduction, 22.0 points; 95% CI,
23.4 to 20.5; P5.0034; Cohen d50.96), and the effect

In the mixed-effects models, both EA (P5.015) and

the effects of both EA and SA were maintained at
week 12.
DISCUSSION
In this RCT, we observed that EA produced significant
and clinically relevant improvements in fatigue, anxiety,
and depression compared with usual care among breast
cancer patients who experienced arthralgia related to AI
use. In contrast, SA produced a similar significant benefit
for depression but not for fatigue or anxiety. These findings have important implications for pain and symptom
management and research in cancer patients.
Our study is consistent with a small but growing
body of literature suggesting that acupuncture may be

effective for pain,6 fatigue,24 anxiety, and depression.25
Instead of using fixed points, we individualized acupuncture treatment based on a protocol and allowed the acupuncturists not only to treat joint pain but also to
address symptoms such as fatigue and psychological distress.8 This tailored approach may account for the significant improvement produced by EA on these nonpain
symptoms. Our comparison with usual care provided a
clinical context for understanding the relevance of these
effects. For example, in this study, the Cohen d for fatigue was 0.96, suggesting a large clinical effect; whereas
the Cohen d of 0.68 for anxiety suggested a moderately
large effect.26 The Cohen d for sleep was 0.63, indicating
a moderately large effect, but this did not quite reach statistical significance. Each of these outcomes is highly correlated and supportive of the efficacy of EA. However,
given the small group size and the potential concern
3749

Original Article

about multiple comparisons, these results should be
interpreted as preliminary. Additional studies will be
needed to confirm the efficacy of EA. Our study also
included a 4-week no-treatment follow-up period, which
suggests that the effect of acupuncture for these symptoms persisted, at least for the short term. This is clinically important, because continued weekly treatments of
acupuncture for a long period can be cost-prohibitive
and time-consuming for most patients with breast
cancer.
Our study also provides a novel understanding of
how fatigue, sleep, and psychological distress relate to
pain in patients with clinically meaningful, AI-related
arthralgia. We observed that pain-related interference was
highly correlated with fatigue (r50.75) and was moderately correlated with depression (r50.58) and sleep
(r50.35). These findings extend the previous research in
patients with breast cancer who undergo chemotherapy10
or who have metastatic/recurrent disease.10 Our findings
suggest that clusters of pain, fatigue, sleep, and psychological distress may exist in patients receiving AIs, requiring
further evaluation of the shared biobehavioral pathway of
these symptoms as well as the impact of these symptoms
on patients.
The neuroendocrine-immune mechanism of pain
and behavioral symptoms (eg, fatigue, sleep) was proposed by earlier researchers.13 Thornton et al observed
that shared variance of plasma levels of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine
were associated with shared variance of the pain, depression, and fatigue symptom cluster in breast cancer
patients who had advanced disease.11 These findings
indicate that both the HPA axis and SNS regulation are
part of a common mechanistic pathway.11 More recently,
cytokine genetic variations were associated with fatigue
and depressive symptoms, providing further evidence for
potential neuroendocrine-immune mechanisms.27 It has
been demonstrated that acupuncture influences the HPA
axis14 and SNS28 in addition to potentially exerting an
immune-modulatory effect,15 which offers biologic plausibility regarding why it can simultaneously address common pain and nonpain symptoms in cancer patients.
Future clinical trials incorporating appropriate experimental designs and biomarkers may help uncover the
mechanisms underlying the effect of acupuncture for
these common symptoms.
Several limitations need to be acknowledged.
Although our original study was powered to detect a difference in pain between EA and WLC,8 it was not powered to detect a statistically significant difference between
3750

EA and SA. In this report, we provide the effect size of
both EA and SA compared with WLC in fatigue, sleep,
anxiety, and depression; but the study is underpowered to
detect differences between EA and SA. Therefore, we did
not statistically compare effects between EA and SA but
provided the magnitude of change in EA and SA so that
future research can be powered. In addition, we evaluated
multiple outcomes, raising concerns for multiple comparisons. Although our results should be considered supportive of the efficacy of EA, additional studies will be
required to confirm these findings. Furthermore, 12% of
our participants were lost to follow-up. We performed
sensitivity analyses by analyzing completers only as well as
carrying last values forward. These results were consistent
with our intent-to-treat analyses. Finally, sham control in
our study may not function as a physiologically inert placebo because of tactile stimulation of sensory receptors.
Conclusions

Among patients with breast cancer who experience clinically important joint symptoms that are attributable to
AIs, pain is associated significantly with fatigue, sleep, and
depression. EA has demonstrated promise as a therapy to
address these symptoms in addition to pain. These preliminary findings need to be confirmed in a larger trial
that includes longer follow-up. Careful incorporation of
behavioral instruments and biomarkers in the trial setting
can help elucidate the mechanisms underlying both the
symptom cluster and the effect of acupuncture.
FUNDING SUPPORT
This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health
(National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine
[NCCAM] R21 AT004695). Dr. Mao is a recipient of the
NCCAM K23 AT004112 award.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES
Dr. Farrar has consulted for Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Dr. DeMichele has received research support from Pfizer unrelated to aromatase inhibitors. Dr. Xie has consulted for Roche.
