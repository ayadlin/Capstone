ABSTRACT
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells residing in the bone marrow (BM) and
in secondary lymphoid tissues receive survival and proliferative signals from the
microenvironment, resulting in persistence of residual disease after treatment. In this
study, we characterized primary CLL cells cultured with BM stromal cells, CD40 ligand
and CpG ODN to partially mimic the microenvironment in the proliferative centers.
This co-culture system induced proliferation and chemoresistance in primary CLL cells.
Importantly, co-cultured primary CLL cells shared many phenotypical features with
circulating proliferative CLL cells, such as upregulation of ZAP-70 and CD38 and higher
CD49d and CD62L expression. This indicates aggressiveness and capability to interact
with surrounding cells, respectively. In addition, levels of CXCR4 were decreased due
to CXCR4 internalization after CXCL12 stimulation by BM stromal cells. We suggest
that this co-culture system can be used to test drugs and their combinations that
target the proliferative and drug resistant CLL cells.

INTRODUCTION

Within this tissue microenvironment, CLL cells receive
advantageous signals from accessory cells such as T
cells[5], mesenchymal stromal cells[6] and nurse-like
cells[7]. These signals are propagated through diverse
receptors, such as CD40[8], Toll-like receptors (TLR)
[9], CXCR4[10] and the B cell receptor (BCR)[11],
which activate downstream signaling pathways that
ultimately promote proliferation, modulate cell adhesion
and chemotaxis and protect CLL cells from spontaneous
and drug-induced apoptosis. Residual leukemic cells
residing in these protective niches after treatment are
therefore potentially contributing to minimal residual
disease (MRD) persistence and to the disease relapse
virtually observed in all patients after chemotherapy
even after achievement of complete remission[12],[13].
Further characterization of primary CLL cells found in
the proliferative niches can facilitate the discovery and
study of new therapeutic targets specifically expressed by

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most
prevalent B-cell malignancy in adults in Western countries,
is characterized by the expansion of monoclonal mature
B cells expressing CD5 and CD23 in peripheral blood
(PB), secondary lymphoid tissues, and the bone marrow
(BM)[1]. CLL cells had been described to accumulate as a
result of a defective apoptosis, rather than of an increased
proliferation[1]. This hypothesis was mainly based on the
fact that most of the circulating cells are arrested in the G0/
G1 phase of the cell cycle[2]. However, it was later shown
that a distinct fraction of CLL cells are proliferating, being
the cell birth rate 0.1% to 1% of the CLL clone per day[3].
CLL cells mainly receive proliferative signals in tissue
compartments, such as lymph nodes (LN) and BM, where
CLL cells form aggregates of activated, proliferating cells
called “proliferation centers” or “pseudofollicles”[4].

RESULTS

this proliferative and chemoresistant subset of CLL cells,
which could ultimately help to eradicate MRD.
With the aim of better defining proliferating primary
CLL cells, we characterized primary CLL cells cultured
ex vivo in conditions mimicking the microenvironment
found in the proliferative centers and compared them to
proliferating subclones of CLL cells found in PB from
patients with active disease, which likely represent cells
that have been stimulated in the proliferation centers while
residing in the LN or BM before becoming quiescent again
in PB [14]. The herein described ex-vivo culture system
induced proliferation of primary CLL cells that shared
physiologic and immunophenotypic characteristics with
those proliferating CLL cells found in vivo, providing
an easily reproducible system for the ex vivo testing of
new drugs specifically targeting this clinically relevant
compartment of CLL cells.

Effects of BMSC, CD40 and CpG ODN in
proliferation, cell cycle and viability of primary
CLL cells
With the aim of partially ex vivo mimicking the
microenvironment found in the proliferative centers,
we cultured primary CLL cells in 5 different culture
conditions: in suspension, co-cultured with the BMSC
cell line UE6E7T-2, with soluble CD40L, with CpG ODN
and with the combination of all elements: BMSC, CD40L
and CpG ODN. Next, we analyzed the effects in terms
of proliferation and survival after 24, 48 and 72 hours of
culture. In this setting, proliferative responses, measured
as increase in expression of Ki-67, were significantly
observed after 48 hours in CLL cells cultured with BMSC,
CD40L and CpG ODN (Figure 1A) (mean % Ki-67
positive cells: 4.41±1.41 cultured with BMSC, CD40L and
CpG ODN vs. 0.42±0.10 in suspension, P<0.01) and were

biological parameters.

hours of culture, we measured metabolic activity using an
MTS-based cell assay. We observed that the results were
comparable to Ki-67 analysis, being the co-culture with
BMSC, CD40L and CpG ODN the condition inducing
the highest degree of proliferation after 72 hours. These
results strongly suggest that the lower percentage of viable
cells simultaneously observed with an increase in Ki-67positive cells and metabolic activity is probably caused by
exhaustion of nutrients in the culture media due to a rapid
CLL cell turnover.
Finally, we did not observe any significant
correlation between the induction of proliferation or
survival by the co-culture with BMSC, CD40L and CpG
ODN and clinical stage, CD38, ZAP-70 expression or the
mutational status of IGHV genes (Table 1).

even higher after 72 hours when, as we had previously
observed [15], the co-culture with BMSC, CD40L and
CpG ODN induced a Ki-67 expression of 10.71% ± 2.51%
vs. 1.18%±0.34% in suspension (P<0.001).Interestingly,
when we analyzed the effect of every stimulus
independently we observed that none of them increased
Ki-67 expression significantly (mean % Ki-67 positive
cells: 1.18±0.34 cultured in suspension vs. 2.52±0.74
cultured with BMSC vs. 1.41±0.44 cultured with CD40L
vs. 4.42±1.75 cultured with CpG ODN, P=n.s.).
Furthermore we analyzed the ratio of CLL cells
in G1, S and G2/M phases after 72 hours of culture in
the above described different culture conditions. Cell
cycle analysis showed that the addition of CpG ODN to
CLL cells culture induced an entry into S/G2/M phase,
this increasing with the addition of BMSC and CD40L
(Figure 1B) (mean % cells in S phase with CpG ODN
vs. suspension: 7.56±0.89 vs. 2.81±0.38, P<0.001; mean
% cells in S phase with BMSC+CD40L+CpG ODN vs.
suspension: 8.99±1.26 vs. 2.81±0.38, P<0.001; mean %
cells in G2/M phase with BMSC+CD40L+CpG ODN vs.
suspension: 2.54±1.27 vs. 0.89±0.28, P=n.s.).
Viability assays showed that none of the analyzed
co-culture conditions induced significant changes in
CLL cells viability until 72 hours. At this time point,
both BMSC and CD40L alone protected primary CLL
cells from spontaneous apoptosis although statistical
significance was not reached (Figure 1C) (mean % of
viable cells in suspension vs. co-cultured with BMSC vs.
with CD40L: 47.95±5.27 vs. 65.05±7.02 vs.53.53±5.95,
P=n.s.). In contrast, the addition of CpG ODN induced
a significant decrease in the percentage of viable cells
which was not restored with the addition of BMSC and
CD40L (mean % of viable cells in suspension vs. with
CpG ODN: 47.95±5.27 vs. 22.88±4.26, P<0.01; mean
% of viable cells in suspension vs. BMSC+CD40L+CpG

the lower percentage of alive cells, especially after 72

Immunophenotypical differences between resting
and proliferative primary CLL cells from PB
With the aim of comparing primary CLL
cells cultured ex vivo in conditions mimicking the
microenvironment found in the proliferative centers
with proliferating subclones of CLL cells found in PB
from patients with active disease, we initially analyzed
proliferating CLL cells from 40 patients diagnosed
with CLL. For this, we analyzed by FC the differential
expression of CD38, CD49d, CD62L and the chemokine
receptors CXCR4, CXCR5 and CCR7 in Ki-67 positive vs.
Ki-67 negative CLL cells (Figure 2A). Mean percentage of
Ki-67 expression in CLL samples was 1.40±0.26 (range,
0.05-7.41). Ki-67-positive CLL cells showed higher
expression levels of CD38 (mean MFI of CD38 expression
in Ki-67 positive cells vs. Ki-67 negative cells: 57.46±8.43
vs. 25.41±3.83, P<0.001). The expression levels of
integrin CD49d and selectin CD62L were also higher
in Ki-67 positive CLL cells than in Ki-67 negative cells
(mean MFI of CD49d expression in Ki-67 positive cells
vs. Ki-67 negative cells: 44.92±10.15 vs. 39.53±10.43,
P<0.01; mean MFI of CD62L expression in Ki-67 positive

cells vs. Ki-67 negative cells: 37.87±10.03 vs. 31.48±9.41,
P<0.05) while the expression levels of all the chemokine
receptors analyzed were significantly lower (mean MFI
of CXCR4 expression in Ki-67 positive cells vs. Ki-67
negative cells: 172.3±20.03 vs. 223.2±22.35, P<0.001;
mean MFI of CXCR5 expression in Ki-67 positive cells
vs. Ki-67 negative cells: 343.4±31.37 vs. 428.7±38.18,
P<0.001; mean MFI of CCR7 expression in Ki-67 positive
cells vs. Ki-67 negative cells: 110.1±8.07 vs. 149.2±10.65,
P<0.001)(Figure 2A).

We also characterized the proliferative and resting
compartments of CLL cells found in PB using differences
in the expression of CD5 and CXCR4 by FC as previously
defined by Calissano, C et al[16] (Figure 3A). The
percentage of CLL cells falling into each compartment was
similar to the previously observed distribution[16] (Figure
3B) (mean % CLL cells: 4.52±0.82 in CXCR4dimCD5bright
fraction vs. 75.78±2.05 in CXCR4intCD5int fraction vs.
13.83±1.53 in CXCR4brightCD5dim fraction, P<0.001). As
expected, the proliferative compartment defined as the
CXCR4dimCD5bright fraction was significantly enriched
in Ki-67 positive cells (Figure 3C) (mean % Ki-67
positive cells: 3.28±1.12 in CXCR4dimCD5bright fraction
vs. 2.63±0.85 in CXCR4intCD5int fraction, P=n.s.; vs.
0.36±0.21 in CXCR4brightCD5dim fraction, P<0.01). As
we previously reported[15], co-culturing CLL cells for
48 hours induced an increase in the percentage of CLL
cells within the CXCR4dimCD5brightcompartment (Figure
3D) whereas the proportion of CXCR4intCD5int and
CXCR4brightCD5dim cells was not significantly affected
(mean % CXCR4dimCD5bright cells: 23.16±7.25 in coculture vs. 5.67±2.52 in suspension, P<0.05).

The co-culture of primary CLL cells with
BMSC, CD40L and CpG ODN promotes an
immunophenotype comparable to that from
proliferating CLL cells found in PB
As described above, we observed that the coculture of primary CLL cells in conditions mimicking
the microenvironment of the proliferative centers
induced the proliferation of CLL cells in terms of Ki-67
expression, MTS-based cell proliferation assay and cell
cycle entry. In order to compare the immunophenotype
of proliferating CLL cells found in vivo with the ex-vivo
stimulated CLL cells, we analyzed the modulation of the
expression of CD38, CD49d, CD62L, CXCR4, CXCR5
and CCR7 in primary CLL cells after 48 hours of coculture as compared to CLL cells in suspension (Figure
2B). Primary CLL cells in co-culture showed an increase
in the expression of CD38, CD49d and CD62L (mean
MFI of CD38 expression in co-culture vs. in suspension:
151.9±42.56 vs. 60.16±4.79, P<0.05; mean MFI of CD49d
expression in co-culture vs. in suspension: 202.8±22.8 vs.
184.3±22.48, P<0.05; mean MFI of CD62L expression in
co-culture vs. in suspension: 993.9±123.7 vs. 626.0±76.49,
P=n.s.). In addition, co-culture of CLL cells induced a
downregulation of the expression level of CXCR4 (mean
MFI of CXCR4 expression in co-culture vs. in suspension:
247.6±41.23 vs. 741.0±160.3, P<0.001) while CXCR5 and
CCR7 expression levels were not significantly modulated
(mean MFI of CXCR5 expression in co-culture vs. in
suspension: 1122±121.0 vs. 906.6±94.32, P=n.s.; mean
MFI of CCR7 expression in co-culture vs. in suspension:
221.4±13.79 vs. 225.0±23.43, P=n.s.).
To determine whether the co-culture of PBMC from
patients with CLL with BMSC, CD40L and TLR9L also
stimulated T cells we analyzed the expression of Ki-67,
CD38 and CD69 expression in CD3+ mononucleated cells
(Figure 2C). Taking into account that only samples with
at least 85% of CLL cells were included in our study, we
observed a mean percentage of T cells of 4.02±0.84 at
baseline, which was not significantly altered after 48 hours
in co-culture. However, the co-culture did significantly
increase Ki-67, CD38 and CD69 expression in T cells
(Figure 2C) indicating that T cells were also activated
under these co-culture conditions.

The co-culture of primary CLL cells with BMSC,
CD40L and CpG ODN induces ZAP-70 expression
Among the diverse molecular pathways of
crosstalk between CLL cells and their microenvironment,
BCR signaling has been recognized as one of the most
important [17][18]. The expression of the protein tyrosine
kinase ZAP-70 has been associated with increased
BCR signaling in CLL [19] which translated into
increased proliferation and migrative capacity of ZAP70 positive subclones, based on in vitro and in vivo data
[20],[21],[22],[23]. Clinically, ZAP-70 expression has
been correlated with IgVH mutational status, disease
progression and survival[24]. Therefore, we hypothesized
that ZAP-70 expression could be upregulated in
proliferating CLL subclones. In order to test this, we
assessed ZAP-70 expression in CLL cells from PB
according to Ki-67 expression and subsequently in
primary CLL cells co-cultured in proliferative conditions.
Firstly, we observed that the Ki-67 positive fraction
of CLL cells from the PB was significantly enriched in
ZAP-70 positive cells (Figure 4A) (mean % of ZAP70 expression: 83.93±2.40 in Ki-67 positive cells vs.
29.22±4.20 in Ki-67 negative cells, P<0.001). We also
determined ZAP-70 expression according to CXCR4 and
CD5 expression and interestingly, we observed that the
proliferative CXCR4dimCD5bright fraction was also enriched
in ZAP-70 positive cells (Figure 4B) (mean % ZAP-70

Primary CLL cells in co-culture develop marked
chemoresistance to treatment with fludarabine

positive cells: 67.35±3.66 in CXCR4dimCD5bright fraction
vs. 38.71±3.87 in CXCR4intCD5int fraction, P<0.001; vs.
19.29±3.04 in CXCR4brightCD5dim fraction, P<0.001). In
order to elucidate if signals from the microenvironment
could directly modulate the expression of ZAP-70, we
cultured primary CLL cells in suspension or co-cultured
with BMSC, CD40L and CpG ODN for 48 hours and
observed that the percentage of ZAP-70 positive cells was
significantly increased (Figure 4C and 4D) (mean % ZAP70 positive cells: 61.50±7.33 in co-culture vs. 16.91±4.23
in suspension, P<0.01). This was further confirmed
by western blot, where we also observed ZAP-70 upregulation in primary CLL cells co-cultured with BMSC,
CD40L and CpG ODN for 48 hours. To clarify which of
these stimuli contributed to ZAP-70 up-regulation, we
cultured primary CLL cells with BMSC, CD40L or CpG
ODN separately, and assessed ZAP-70 expression by
western blot. We observed a marked ZAP-70 up-regulation
as a consequence of either CD40 or TLR9 stimulation
alone (Figure 4E).

The microenvironment found in the proliferative
centers has been shown to provide direct pro-survival
signals and to protect CLL cells from the effect of
chemotherapeutical agents[7],[25]. Consequently, this
proliferative and chemoresistant compartment of CLL
cells has been hypothesized to be potentially responsible
for MRD persistence and disease relapse. In this regard, to
evaluate the role of co-culture on the chemoresistance of
primary CLL cells, we co-cultured primary CLL cells for
48 hours and subsequently treated them with increasing
doses of fludarabine or bendamustine for additional 24
hours. Interestingly, as we previously described[15], the
co-culture of CLL cells in these conditions inhibited at
such extend the capacity of fludarabine to induce apoptosis
that it was not possible to calculate its LD50, whereas LD50
of fludarabine in CLL cells in suspension was 416μM

DISCUSSION

(95% CI 125.5-1379) (Figure 5A). For CLL cells treated
with bendamustine, LD50 of CLL cells in proliferative
conditions was 5.18 times higher than for CLL cells in
suspension (Figure 5B).
To determine the molecular mechanisms related
to this co-culture-induced chemoresistance we analyzed
the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and
Bcl-2, which are up-regulated in CLL cells and provide
them with protection against apoptosis induced by
chemotherapy[26],[27]. After 48 hours of co-culture
only the expression of Mcl-1 was significantly increased
(Figures 5C, 5D and 5E), further highlighting its role in
CLL resistance to chemotherapy.

Compelling evidence suggests that the crosstalk
between CLL cells and accessory cells in the BM and/or
lymphoid tissue microenvironments plays a relevant role
in the natural history of CLL by promoting tumoral cell
survival, proliferation and drug resistance (Reviewed in
Burger et al[4]). Therefore, further characterization of the
different cells and stimuli participating in this process is
of great interest in order to define new therapeutic targets
aimed at interfering with this favorable condition. Based
on these considerations, the aim of this study was to
further characterize this proliferative and chemoresistant
CLL compartment by firstly studying the phenotypic

characteristics of proliferating CLL cells found in the
PB of patients. Subsequently, we compared their features
with those found after co-culture in conditions partially
mimicking the microenvironment from the proliferation
centers. This allowed us to describe an easily reproducible
ex vivo system that will facilitate the study of this crucial
CLL cell compartment and consequently, the discovery of
new therapeutic targets.
We co-cultured primary CLL cells with BMSC
since they have been demonstrated to support the
survival of CLL cells from both spontaneous and druginduce apoptosis [6],[7],[28],[29]. Moreover, it has
been found that BMSC can activate resting CLL cells to

increase their expression of CD38, as well as promote
activation of CD71, CD69, CD25 and CD70[30]. Based
on evidences from in vitro experiments with CD40L that
indicate the importance of T cells with regards to CLL
cell proliferation and survival[31],[32],[33][8],[34],[5], we
added soluble CD40L to our co-culture system. Finally, we
used the TLR9 agonists CpG ODN to stimulate primary
CLL cells. Toll-like receptors have been described as
potent activators of CLL cell proliferation, cytokine
production and upregulation of costimulatory molecules
involved in B cell-T cell interaction such as CD40,
CD80, CD86, CD54 MHC class I and CD58[35][36]
[37]. Simultaneous stimulation with CD40/CpG ODN has

been studied previously in CLL cells, observing enhanced
immunogenicity[35] and distinctive proliferation in IGHV
unmutated CLL cells correlating with the development of
drug resistance[36].
In addition, we observed a modulation of the
immunophenotype of CLL cells that was remarkably
comparable to that from proliferating CLL cells found
in PB of patients. These phenotypical changes indicate
that these CLL cells become activated and consequently,
more aggressive as shown by enhanced CD38 and
ZAP-70 expression, and more likely to interact with
other cells as shown by enhanced CD49d and CD62L
expression. Regarding chemokine receptors, we observed
downregulation of CXCR4, CXCR5 and CCR7 in
proliferating CLL cells from the PB, probably indicating
a recent recirculation from BM or lymphoid tissue. In the
ex vivo co-culture system this was partially reproduced:
CXCR4 expression was downregulated, while CXCR5
and CCR7 expression remained otherwise stable.
This might be explained by the fact that our co-culture
system included BMSC which produce the CXCR4
ligand CXCL12[38], but not MSC from secondary
lymphoid tissues which are the responsible for CXCL13
and CCL19 production, ligands for CXCR5 and CCR7
respectively[39],[40],[41]. Additionally, the co-culture
also resulted in stimulation of T cells from patients with
CLL, which probably contributed to the activation of CLL
cells. Besides its prognostic value, ZAP-70 expression
is linked to activation of CLL cells[19],[22],[42] and
its expression correlates with that of Ki-67 in CLL
patients[21]. ZAP-70 expression has been clinically and
biologically linked to aggressive features in CLL, but
its regulation is still largely unknown; interestingly, we
showed that the proliferative fraction of CLL cells from
the PB was markedly enriched in ZAP-70 positive cells,
and that the herein described co-culture system induced
the expression of ZAP-70 in proliferating cells. Both
CD40 and TLR9 stimulation independently were able to
provoke an increase in the expression of ZAP-70, although
CD40L alone was not enough to induce proliferation.
Functionally, we observed that this co-culture system
promoted the proliferation of chemoresistant CLL cells,
as shown in fludarabine and bendamustine-treated primary
CLL cells, and that was accompanied by the induction of
the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1. This
is in line with previous studies using not only stromal
cells [28],[29],[43] but also CD40 [8],[44] and TLR9
[9] stimulation in CLL cells culture systems[15]. In
summary, our findings demonstrate that the co-culture of
CLL cells with BMSC, CD40L and CpG ODN promotes
the proliferation of chemoresistant primary CLL cells
with a phenotype comparable to that from the circulating
proliferative CLL cell. CLL therapy is heading towards
targeted therapies as new and more effective drugs are
emerging. This co-culture system has already been used
for testing the survivin inhibitor YM155 which resulted
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

specifically active to target the proliferative and drug
resistant CLL cell compartment[15]. Therefore, this study
provides a model for a co-culture system which might
serve as a basis for testing these new drugs, particularly
in combination, to better select the most active treatment
for this disease.

METHODS
Isolation and culture of primary CLL cells
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from
64patients diagnosed with CLL were obtained by FicollPaque Plus (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, United
Kingdom) density gradient and subsequently criopreserved
until analysis. Only samples with ≥85% of CLL cells
(CD19+/CD5+ cells, as assessed by flow cytometry (FC))
were included in the study. Written informed consent
was obtained from all patients in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and the study was approved by
the local clinical investigation ethical committee.

Cell lines
The UE6E7T-2 human bone marrow stromal cells
(BMSC) cell line was obtained from Riken Cell Bank
(Ibaraki, Japan). Cells were cultured at 37ºC in 5% CO2
atmosphere in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM; Gibco, Carbbad, CA, USA) supplemented with
2mM L-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 50μg/mL penicillin/streptomycin. The
T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line Jurkat was
obtained from ATCC and was cultured in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 2mM L-glutamine, 10% heatinactivated FBS and 50μg/mL penicillin/streptomycin.

Co-culture conditions
BMSC were seeded at a concentration of 1.5x104
cells/mL in 24-well plates and incubated for 24 hours to
allow cells to adhere. CLL cells were cultured at a ratio
of 100:1 (1.5 x106cells/mL) on confluent layers of BMSC
in RPMI medium. Cells were stimulated with 1μg/mL
CD40L (Peprotech, London, United Kingdom) and/or
1.5μg/mL CpG ODN (ODN2006; Invivogen, San Diego,
CA, USA) when indicated. CLL cells were harvested by
gently washing off, leaving the adherent stromal cell layer
intact.

Flow cytometry
Intracellular staining of Ki-67 was performed using
a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled antibody
7640

Oncotarget

against Ki-67 (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
USA) after fixation and permeabilization using the
BD Intrasure kit (Becton Dickinson) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Surface staining of cells was
performed using the following monoclonal antibodies
conjugated with the indicated fluorochrome: CD19phycoerythrin (PE) and CD5-allophycocyanine (APC)
(Becton Dickinson). To characterize the phenotype of
proliferative and resting compartments of CLL cells,we
used the following antibodies: CD19-energy coupled
dye (ECD), CD5-phycoerythrincyanine 5.5 (PC5.5)
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), CD3-PE-cyanine 7
(Cy7), CXCR4-APC, CXCR5-APC, CCR7-APC, CD49dAPC, CD62L-APC, Ki-67-FITC (Becton Dickinson), and
CD38-PE (EBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA). The rates
of T cell activation and proliferation were analyzed by
determining the expression of Ki-67, CD69 and CD38 in
CD3+ cellsusing the following antibodies: Ki-67-FITC,
CD38-PE (EBioscience), CD5-PC5.5 (Beckman Coulter),
CD3-PE-Cy7 and CD69-APC (Becton Dickinson). Cells
were acquired in a NaviosTM cytometer (Beckman Coulter)
and the results were analyzed using the FCS Express 4
software (De Novo Software, Los Angeles, CA, USA).

Aldrich, San Louis, MO, USA) for 1 hour at 4ºC. Protein
concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein
assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Equal amounts
of denatured protein were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE
and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore,
Bedford, MA, USA). Membranes were blocked for
1 hour at room temperature (RT) in 5% milk/TBS-T.
Membranes were incubated overnight at 4ºC with primary
antibodies against ZAP-70, Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies, Dallas, TX, USA), and GAPDH (Abcam,
Cambridge, United Kingdom). Immunodetection was
done with the corresponding IgG HRP-linked secondary
antibodies (Dako North America, Glostrup, Denmark),
and the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (GE
Healthcare). Chemiluminescent images were acquired
with the LAS-4000 system (Buckinghamshire, United
Kingdom). Protein expression was subsequently quantified
using the Image J 1.46r software (National Institutes of
Health).

Reagents
Fludarabine and bendamustine (Sigma, St Louis,
MO, USA)were dissolved in DMSO and stored at -20ºC.

Cell proliferation assay

Assessment of apoptosis

Cell proliferation was measured using the
CellTiter96TM Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA) which uses the cellular conversion
of MTS tetrazolium compound into a colored formazan
product. A total of 7.5 x104 CLL cells per well were seeded
in a 96-well plate in 100μL of RPMI and 20μL of MTS.
Plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37ºC and absorbance
was measured in a plate reader at 490nm.

Apoptosis was assessed by analyzing the binding
of annexin V-FITC and the incorporation of PI by FC.
Annexin V/PI double negative cells were considered
viable cells. Staining was performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions using the annexin V-FITC
apoptosis detection kit (Bender Medsystems, Vienna,
Austria).

Cell cycle analysis

Statistical analysis

Propidium iodide (PI) was used to determine each
phase of the cell cycle according to the DNA content of
CLL cells. For this, cells were resuspended in ice-cold
70% ethanol and incubated at -20ºC for 30 minutes.
Cells were then washed twice with phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) and resuspended in PBS containing 38nM
sodium citrate, 10mg/mL ribonuclease A and 1μg/μL PI.
Cells were finally incubated at 37ºC for 30 minutes and
subsequently analyzed by FC.

Results are expressed as the mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM) of at least three independent
experiments. The statistically significant difference
between groups was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney
test or one or two-way ANOVA (t test), and P<0.05 was
considered significant. Lethal dose 50 (LD50) values were
calculated with GraphPad Prism software version 5.0
(San Diego, CA, USA). Analyses were performed using
the biostatistics software package SPSS version 17 (IBM,
Chicago, IL, USA). Results were graphed with GraphPad
Prism software.

Western blot analysis
Whole cell protein extracts were prepared from
4.5x106cells using 50μL lysis buffer containing 20mM
Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) pH 7.4, 1mM
EDTA, 140mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 supplemented with 2mM
sodium vanadate and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigmawww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget
