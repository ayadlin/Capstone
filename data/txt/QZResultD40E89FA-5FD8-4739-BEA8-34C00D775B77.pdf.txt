ABSTRACT
It has been commonly found that in patients presenting Pancreatic Ductal
Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), after a period of satisfactory response to standard
treatments, the tumor becomes non-responsive and patient death quickly follows.
This phenomenon is mainly due to the rapid and uncontrolled development of the
residual tumor. The origin and biological characteristics of residual tumor cells in
PDAC still remain unclear. In this work, using PDACs from patients, preserved as
xenografts in nude mice, we demonstrated that a residual PDAC tumor originated
from a small number of CD44+ cells present in the tumor. During PDAC relapse,
proliferating CD44+ cells decrease expression of ZEB1, while overexpressing the
MUC1 protein, and gain morphological and biological characteristics of differentiation.
Also, we report that CD44+ cells, in primary and residual PDAC tumors, are part of a
heterogeneous population, which includes variable numbers of CD133+ and EpCAM+
cells. We confirmed the propagation of CD44+ cells in samples from cases of human
relapse, following standard PDAC treatment. Finally, using systemic administration of
anti-CD44 antibodies in vivo, we demonstrated that CD44 is an efficient therapeutic
target for treating tumor relapse, but not primary PDAC tumors. We conclude that
CD44+ cells generate the relapsing tumor and, as such, are themselves promising
therapeutic targets for treating patients with recurrent PDAC.

INTRODUCTION

molecular and genetic features of pancreatic cancer cells,
which impair drug entry into the cells, or affect cellular
metabolism, may increase the chemoresistance of
PDAC [4]. However, the variation in expression of these
cancer cell properties generates diverse grades of PDAC
resistance, each of which requires adapted treatment,
which may in turn affect survival time for patients.
Clinically, PDAC disease progresses rapidly and
causes patient death in the majority of cases, though some
pancreatic tumors show a temporary objective response

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of
the deadliest cancers worldwide, due to early metastases
and strong chemoresistance [1, 2]. This chemoresistance
is due, in part, to the characteristic stromal composition
of these cells, which acts as a mechanical barrier, and
the subsequent reduced vascularization of the cellular
environment, both of which interfere with the ability of
drugs to reach the target cells [3]. Furthermore, biological,

[5-7]. Resistant cancer cells are refractory to therapy
and produce tumors that grow uninterrupted, ultimately
causing rapid patient decline and death. Conversely, for
sensitive tumors, two theories exist to explain PDAC
recurrence. Firstly, it is thought that during the course
of treatment, some cancer cells become progressively
resistant to the antitumoral drugs, generating a gradually
resistant tumor. Secondly, it has been proposed that the
residual tumor starts from a cancer cell population that is
naturally not targeted by the anticancer agents. Moreover,
the possibility that residual tumors may result from a
combination of both a selection of resistant cells along
with an expansion of a marginal population of naturally
insensitive cells, cannot be excluded.
It is noteworthy that current chemotherapeutic
strategies are based on targeting rapidly dividing cells.
However, most tumors, including PDACs, possess a
specific, small, non-replicative cell population, which
may be referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs) [8]. These
CSCs are thought to be insensitive to anticancer treatments
and could be the source of residual tumors [9]. Current
consensus describes CSCs as cells within a tumor, which
are able to self-renew, and produce a heterogeneous
lineage of cancer cells which are represented in the tumor
[10]. The stem cell hypothesis has recently been explored
in pancreatic cancer [11]. The prospective identification
of CSC populations from various tumors of epithelial
origin, including the breast, colon and prostate, has been
undertaken [12-15]. Ex vivo, the population of CSCs
can be identified using various surface markers, the
most common of which are a combination of EpCAM,
CD44 and CD24 or the single marker CD133 [8, 11, 16].
Evidence supporting the chemoresistance of the stem-like
cells in epithelial cell lines and xenogeneic tumor-derived
cells has been reported [12, 17-21].
A residual tumor can be defined as a small
tumor mass that grows after an incomplete response to
chemotherapy treatment of the original tumor, and is
the origin of tumor relapse, which ultimately results in
patient death. Hence, residual tumor cells are the key
factor responsible for tumor recurrence. However, the
origin and biological characteristics of PDAC residual
tumor cells remain unclear. Therefore, theoretically,
primary and residual tumors could consist of cells with
different biological characteristics, which may suggest
that treatments for primary and relapsing tumors should
be based on different therapeutic strategies. In this paper,
using PDACs from patients, preserved as xenografts
in nude mice, we report that cells expressing the CD44
marker are at the source of the residual tumor, following
standard antitumoral treatment. We found that these
cells proliferate in the tumor and simultaneously lose
dedifferentiation markers and gain markers associated
with differentiation. Finally, we also found that targeting
residual tumor cells with a specific antibody makes it
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

possible to efficiently block tumor growth, although the
same treatment was almost entirely ineffective for treating
primary PDAC tumors. In conclusion, in this paper we
propose that treatment of residual tumors should be
revised and adapted to their cell specific biology.

RESULTS
The heterogeneous responses of PDAC-derived
xenografts to gemcitabine treatment
Seven patient-derived xenografts (PDX) were
selected for study. Clinical and histopathological
characteristics of the patients and the PDAC tumors
are presented in Supplemental Table S2 and Figure S1.
As shown in Figure 1A, X-IPC and AH-IPC tumors
were highly sensitive, while I-IPC and C-NOR tumors
were moderately sensitive to therapy. Meanwhile AOIPC, HN14 and R-IPC tumors were highly resistant to
gemcitabine treatment as shown in Figure 1A. However,
after treatment withdrawal, both moderately sensitive
and sensitive PDXs, started to re-grow (Figure 1A).
Surprisingly, histological analysis of the PDX tissues
revealed that after treatment, all tumors presented with
morphological features of improved differentiation, with
a gain in glandular formation, a well polarized phenotype
(see Figure 1B) and a strong production of mucus, as
demonstrated by alcian blue staining (Figure 1C). These
results allow us to conclude that following gemcitabine
treatment, the PDAC tumor cell phenotype alters, to
become more differentiated.

Cells expressing CSC-associated markers
are enriched in relapsing tumors following
gemcitabine treatment
Considering that CSCs represent the only
cell population with tumor-initiating potential, we
hypothesized that these cells, which seem to play a crucial
role in treatment resistance, are associated with the
phenotypic transformation described above. These cells are
capable of resisting toxicity by drugs, such as gemcitabine,
that target highly proliferative cells, since they enter into
the cell cycle less frequently and only divide in response
to certain stimuli, which have yet to be fully identified.
We sought to investigate the potential involvement
of CSCs in driving residual tumor growth following
gemcitabine treatment. We used immunohistochemistry
to analyze the expression of some CSC-associated cell
surface markers on these tumors. We selected PDXs
which were either sensitive to, or moderately or highly
resistant to gemcitabine therapy (X-IPC, C-NOR and AOIPC, respectively). Those PDXs reaching a volume of 400

mm3 received either vehicle or 100 mg/kg gemcitabine,
twice weekly. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that
the percentage of CD44+, EpCAM+ and CD133+ cells in
gemcitabine-treated tumors increased systematically 3-4
folds when compared to vehicle-treated tumors. As shown
in Figure 2A, CD44 expression was found in 22±2.8%,
25±2.3% and 30±4.4% of vehicle-treated tumors, while
its expression increased to 59±7.0%, 65±7.2% and
73±7.9% in gemcitabine-treated X-IPC, C-NOR and
AO-IPC, respectively. Similarly, EpCAM was expressed
in 3.6±1.0%, 0.2±0.7% and 4.3±0.8% of vehicle-treated
tumors and increased to 24±2.8%, 1.2±1.3% and 31±3.3%
in gemcitabine-treated X-IPC, C-NOR and AO-IPC,
respectively (Figure 2B). Finally, CD133 was expressed
in 5.0±0.5%, 1.0±0.9% and 5.1±0.8% of vehicle-treated
tumors, while in gemcitabine-treated tumors its expression

was found in 18±2.7%, 3.2±1.2% and 5.3±1.2% of
X-IPC, C-NOR and AO-IPC, respectively (Figure 2C).
Quantification is shown in Figure 2D. Thus, these data
strongly suggest that gemcitabine treatment may select
a highly enriched population of cells expressing CSCassociated markers in vivo. Interestingly, CD44+ cells
are the most abundant population, when compared with
the expression of EpCAM and CD133. In addition, this
selection is independent of the degree of gemcitabine
chemosensitivity of each tumor.

CD44+ cells present phenotypical characteristics
of differentiation, and proliferate in relapsing
PDAC tumors

Expression of CSC-associated markers does not
predict the chemosensitivity of PDAC-derived
cells in vitro

To characterize the evolution of CD44expressing cells, we investigated the expression of cell
differentiation-associated markers. To this end, we
used immunofluorescence to analyze the expression
of the ZEB1 protein, which has been associated with
poor differentiation, and CD44. We found a significant
decrease of ZEB1 expression after gemcitabine treatment.
Remarkably, we detected ZEB1 in 42±3.2%, 11±0.9%
and 53±3.5% of cells in vehicle-treated PDXs whereas its
expression decreased to 9.2±1.1%, 0.9±0.1% and 33±3.1%
after gemcitabine treatment in X-IPC, C-NOR and AOIPC PDXs, respectively (Figure 3A). ZEB1 frequently
colocates with CD44 in vehicle-treated PDXs but rarely
in gemcitabine-treated PDXs. The decreased expression
of ZEB1 after gemcitabine treatment was confirmed by
western blot analysis (Figure 3B and 3C). Furthermore,
we evaluated MUC1 expression, which, conversely,
is strongly associated with cellular differentiation. As
illustrated in Figure 3D, though some cells of the vehicletreated PDXs expressed MUC1, but never colocalizes
with CD44+ cells. However, after gemcitabine treatment
we found that the majority of the CD44+ residual cells
expressed MUC1 (Figure 3D and F). Western blot analysis
confirmed that MUC1 expression dramatically increased
in gemcitabine-treated tumors, when compared to vehicletreated samples (Figure 3E).
The increased number of CD44+ cells after
gemcitabine treatment of PDXs may be attributed to the
ability of these cells to proliferate, and the expression
of the CD44 marker in resistant cells, in the absence of
cell proliferation. Therefore, we evaluated the capacity of
CD44+ cells to proliferate by measuring the expression of
the PCNA proliferation-associated marker. Notably, upon
gemcitabine treatment in vivo, surviving cells, bearing the
CD44+ phenotype, re-enter the cell cycle en masse, as
demonstrated by the significant increase in PCNA staining
(Figure 3G and H). The proportion of PCNA positively
stained nuclei in CD44+ cells, after gemcitabine treatment,
increased from 4.2±0.2%, 2.1±0.1% and 13±2.1% to
43±4.0% 41±3.3% 58±5.1% in X-IPC, C-NOR and AOIPC, respectively. In summary, these results strongly
indicate that CD44+ cells have a limited proliferation
ratio in vehicle-treated cells but, conversely, the recurrent
tumor develops mainly from CD44+ cells, since they
show a high proliferative index, coupled with a loss of
the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker
ZEB1, and an increased expression of the differentiation
associated protein MUC1.

The association between chemoresistance and CSC
marker expression in vitro has been proposed, though
not yet confirmed. We developed an approach to study
whether the expression of some CSC-associated markers
is predictive of chemosensitivity in PDAC-derived cells.
We established an independent set of 14 primary cultures,
from PDXs obtained from patients with PDAC. The
expressions of CD44, CD24, EpCAM and ALDH activity,
all of which are CSC markers, were measured by flow
cytometry analysis. Results are presented in Figure 4A. As
shown, CD44 expression varied from 3.2 to 96.2%, CD24
from 0.5 to 45.3%, EpCAM from 0 to 94.2% and ALDH
activity ranged from 0 to 74.5% in the PDX-derived cells
(see Table S3). We then determined the IC50 for the 5 most
commonly used drugs in the treatment of patients with
PDAC, namely gemcitabine, 5FU, oxaliplatin, docetaxel
(TXT) and SN-38 in these PDX-derived cells (Figure
4B and Figure S2) and analyzed its relationship with the
expression of CSC markers. Importantly, no correlation
was found between the sensitivity of the PDX- derived
cells to each drug, and the amount of cells expressing
CSC-associated markers individually or in combination
(Figure 4C and Figure S3). We conclude that the number
of cells expressing CSC markers in a population of cells
derived from a PDX, does not predict its sensitivity to the
more frequently used PDAC treatments.

CSC putative CD44+ cells, present in relapsing
tumors, are sensitive to anticancer drugs in vitro
Since the expression of CSC markers does not
predict the responsiveness to the anticancer treatments,
we further studied whether CSC-like cells, present in the
residual tumors, are insensitive to the most commonly used
PDAC chemotherapeutics. First, we used flow cytometry
to measure the percentage of CD44+ cells in primary
cultures obtained from X-IPC, C-NOR and AO-IPC
PDXs, treated with vehicle or with gemcitabine. We found
a significant difference in the proportion of CD44+ cells,
from 23.9% to 61.6% for X-IPC, from 22.8% to 65.8% for
C-NOR and from 30.4% to 84.4% for AO-IPC, between
vehicle and gemcitabine treated PDXs respectively. We
also measured expression of EpCAM and CD133 in these
primary cultures and found a wide variation between
tumors from 0% to 3.5% in vehicle-treated cells and from
0.2% to 22.1% in gemcitabine-treated tumors for EpCAM.
The values for CD133 were 1.2% to 3.5% for vehicletreated cells and from 2.5% to 14.0% for gemcitabinetreated cells (Figure 5A, B). More importantly, we found
that almost all of the EpCAM+ and CD133+ cells were
included in the CD44+ cell population (Figure S4).

Altogether these data allow us to suggest that residual
tumors originate mainly from a population of CD44+
cells in PDAC, and that CD44+ cells are a heterogeneous
population. We then examined the impact of treatment
with increasing doses of gemcitabine, docetaxel, 5FU,
oxaliplatin and SN-38 in primary cultured cells, obtained
from PDXs, treated with vehicle or with gemcitabine.
As expected, treatment with increasing concentration of
gemcitabine showed a higher resistance to the drug, with
a IC50 ranging from 1 to 15.6 µM, 0.06 to 0.33 µM and
0.015 to 0.06 µM for X-IPC, C-NOR and AO-IPC vehicle

or gemcitabine-treated cells, respectively, as showed in
Figure 5C. Unexpectedly, chemosensitivity to docetaxel,
5FU, oxaliplatin and SN-38 varied one cell to another for
PDX-derived cell population. It should be: Unexpectedly,
chemosensitivity to docetaxel, 5FU, oxaliplatin and
SN-38 varied from one PDX-derived cell population to
another, according to tumor and drug utilized as shown
in Figure 5C. These results allow us to conclude that a
higher expression of putative CSCs (CD44+) in a residual
tumor does not predict the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic
treatments in vitro.

CD44 is an efficient therapeutic target for treating
PDAC relapse

which indicated that relapsing tumors are composed
mainly, if not exclusively, of CD44+ cells (Figure 6B).
Consequently, because CD44 is highly expressed in
relapsing PDACs, we evaluated the potential of using
the anti-CD44 mAb to treat PDAC relapse in xenografts.
Xenografts were transplanted to mice and treated by
a cycle of gemcitabine as described in Figure 6A and
mice bearing residual tumors were depleted of CD44 by
systemic injection of the anti-CD44 mAb (200 µg/mice,
twice weekly) in gemcitabine resistant-derived PDXs.
As shown in Figure 6C, treatment with the anti-CD44
mAb significantly reduced tumor volume to the half (450
mm3 ± 6.2). However, when we injected the anti-CD44
antibody into mice bearing a gemcitabine-untreated PDX,

CD44 is used in other cancers as an efficient
therapeutic target [22]. Due to its increased expression in
PDAC residual tumors, CD44 may be a viable therapeutic
target to treat this disease. We therefore evaluated if,
during long-term treatments with chemotherapeutic
agents, CD44+ cells continued to accumulate. The PDXs
were treated for one cycle of treatment with gemcitabine
followed by transplantation of the relapsed tumors to other
mice (Figure 6A). After sufficient tumor regrowth, we
evaluated CD44 expression by immunofluorescence. We
found that almost all cells were positive for CD44 staining,

almost no effect on tumor growth was found (Figure 6D)
indicating the futility of targeting CD44 in primary nonresidual tumors. Altogether, these data strongly suggest
that relapsing PDACs are mainly formed from CD44+
cells, which could be a promising therapeutic target.
Finally, we studied CD44 expression in human
PDACs. We collected 4 PDAC samples from the surgery
of 2 patients who were deemed non-resectable after
their cancers were found to be locally advanced. These
patients underwent standard gemcitabine-based treatment,
which allowed subsequent successful resection of their
tumors, from which we obtained further PDAC samples.
Therefore these samples allowed us the rare opportunity
to compare PDAC samples from the same patients, before
and after chemotherapy. Immunohistochemical analysis of
CD44 expression showed that CD44+ cells were almost
undetectable in tumorigenic cells from pretreated samples,
whereas these cells were dominant after gemcitabine
administration, as showed in Figure 7A. We then
evaluated an additional set of 15 surgical samples from
non-treated patients and 15 samples which were obtained
after gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, and found similar
results, as showed in Figure 7C. The findings obtained
from human specimens collectively support our xenograft
results, suggesting that CD44 could be an efficient
therapeutic target for the treatment of residual but not
primary human PDAC.

rapid and uncontrolled development of the residual tumor.
In fact, the residual tumor is a tumor within another tumor,
which has its own biological characteristics. During the
time in which the standard treatment is effective, sensitive
cells are eliminated but resistant and CSC-like cells
remain. In addition, their coexistence allows the regulation
of one another and the stromal compartment. After this
period of responsiveness to therapy, the feedback control
mechanism governed by the sensitive cells is lost, thus
allowing greater access for the resistant cells to oxygen
and nutrients. Furthermore, these cells have increased
exposure to the factors necessary for tumor relapse,
including CXCL12, through its receptors CXCR4 and
CXCR7 [25], IL6 through the Jak2/Stat3 pathway [26, 27],
EGF, FGF and IGF [28, 29], among others. This facilitates
the rapid proliferation, and subsequent patient decline
commonly seen, after standard treatments which do not
target residual cells. CD44+ cells have been reported to be
involved in the recurrence of several tumor types [30, 31]
including PDACs after radiotherapy [32]. In this paper we
present strong data regarding the origin of the relapsing
PDAC, after treatment with the most commonly utilized
anticancer drug. In addition, we were able to demonstrate
that relapsing tumors are sensitive to anti-CD44 treatment,
thereby supporting the use of this strategy as a possible
treatment for PDAC at this clinically challenging phase.
Interestingly, the FDA-approved humanized anti-CD44
mAb (RG7356) shows very promising results for treating
some hematological malignant diseases [33, 34], which
indicates that a clinical trial for treating patients with
recurrent PDAC could easily be implemented.
However, definitive confirmation of CSCs as the
origin of residual tumors has yet to be achieved, not least
because a formal CSC classification system needs to be
developed in PDAC but also elsewhere. In fact, even
the characteristics of the PDAC-CSC population need
to be established, since several putative markers such
as CD44+, CD133+, CD24+, EpCAM+ and ALDH1
activity, alone or in combination, have been used to
define CSC cells depending on author interpretation [35,
36]. Moreover, the choice of cancer model employed in
a study may present challenges, since almost all studies
have been performed on well-established cell lines,
xenografted to produce tumors, or in cell culture. We used
PDX samples which had the advantage of originating
from primary tumors, with very low numbers of passages
and therefore maintained the original structure and
biological characteristics [37]. Under these experimental
conditions, we found a significant variation in the number
of cells expressing putative CSC markers as shown in
Figure 2 and 4. However, the most represented cell type
within PDAC tumors is CD44+, and notably, CD133+
and EpCAM+ cells are included within this population.
Importantly, in relapsing tumors, the CD44+ cell volume
expands, and CD133+ and EpCAM+ cells proportionally
proliferate, indicating that the CD44+ cell population

DISCUSSION
Establishing the mechanism of tumor relapse,
following chemotherapeutic treatment is very
difficult, especially because of inter- and intra-tumoral
heterogeneity. Here we show, by using direct xenografting
from human PDACs, that, following robust treatment with
gemcitabine, relapsing tumors are formed mainly from
CD44+ cells. Therefore this indicates that CD44 is the
most promising target for treating PDAC tumors after firstline therapy. We also observed that, as a consequence of
chemotherapy treatment, while proliferating CD44+ cells
lose the expression of ZEB1 [23] they gain expression of
the differentiation-associated marker the MUC1 protein
[24] and acquire morphological characteristics of a more
differentiated tumor, suggesting a loss of the EMT and
favoring the Mesenchimal to Ephitelial Transition (MET).
In addition, we demonstrated that CD44+ cells consist
of a heterogeneous population, since varying numbers
of CD133+ and EpCAM+ cells were included in the
population. Finally, we also found an efficient response
to anti-CD44 in the treatment of relapsing but not primary
PDAC tumors.
It is frequently observed in PDAC patients, that after
a period of relatively satisfactory response to standard
treatments, including a significant tumor volume decrease,
the tumor becomes non-responsive and patient death

is heterogeneous within primary PDACs and relapsing
tumors. The relapsing tumor has a larger proportion of
CD44+ cells, than of CD133+ or EpCAM+ cells, making
CD44 the most suitable therapeutic target. In this way,
the utilization of anti-CD44 for treating residual tumors
yields promising results. Moreover, in PDAC samples
from treated patients we were able to demonstrate that
CD44+ cells became the predominant population, whereas
in pre-treatment tumors these cells are fewer in number,
further supporting the use of anti-CD44 for treatment of
recurrent tumors as a promising strategy. We found that
PDACs from patients before chemotherapy showed a
low number of CD44+ cells, whereas after chemotherapy
residual tumors consisted almost entirely of CD44+ cells,
as showed in Figure 7B and 7C. From our point of view,
and based on the present data, we therefore assume that
PDAC residual tumors originate from CD44+ cells rather
than CSC cells, particularly because whether CD44+ cells
may be classified as CSCs remains to be determined.
Although it has been previously suggested that
chemosensitivity could be defined by the amount of
CSC markers, this theory proved inconsistent. Although
previous work reported that CD133+-xenografted cells are
more resistant than CD133- cells to gemcitabine treatment
[8], we found that cells expressing CSC markers were not
particularly more resistant to a standard treatment than the

other cells within the tumor, as presented in Figure 4 and
5. In fact, after strong enrichment of cells expressing CSC
markers in residual tumors treated with gemcitabine, we
observed, as expected, an increased IC50 to gemcitabine,
probably due to clonal selection. However, in these cells
the resistance to 5FU, oxaliplatin, SN-38 and docetaxel
appeared to be PDX- and drug-dependent, as showed in
Figure 5. These results suggest that CSCs could be more
resistant to drugs targeting proliferation-dependent factors,
but that proliferating CSC-like cells behave unpredictably
in terms of chemosensitivity.
A sensitive tumor probably predominately consists
of drug sensitive cells, whereas a resistant tumor is formed
chiefly of resistant cells. This is known as the intra-tumor
heterogeneity [38, 39]. Also, a tumor could be resistant to
one particular drug, but sensitive to another. This is why a
tumor may initially reduce in volume after first-line therapy
and then progress and ultimately cause patient death.
Regarding CD44+ cell accumulation, our findings showed
that this increase occurs in both gemcitabine-resistant and
sensitive tumors, probably due to clonal selection, which
also includes CD44+ cells, as mentioned above. In this
study, we observed that following gemcitabine treatments,
the heterogeneous population of CD44+ cells is therapyresistant, and has unique characteristics such as loss of
the expression of the EMT marker ZEB1 and increased

expression of the differentiation marker MUC1, along
with elevated mucus production and a dramatic gain of
differentiation characteristics. In addition, these CD44+
relapsing cells have the capacity to proliferate, suggesting
that these cells generate a relapsing tumor, with a more
differentiated phenotype (Figure 8). The fact that relapsing
tumors present biological characteristics of differentiation
is not surprising, as in cases of small-cell lung cancer,
which become resistant to chemotherapy, an increased
expression of differentiation markers has previously been
reported [20, 21, 40-42]. Finally, to evaluate if this is a
gemcitabine-dependent mechanism, we quantified CD44+
cells in docetaxel-treated tumors and we found a very close
response to gemcitabine-treated xenografts, suggesting
that this mechanism is not exclusively associated to the
gemcitabine treatment.
In summary, we present data demonstrating that
relapsing PDAC tumors originate from the expansion
of CD44+ cells. These CD44+ proliferating cells
decrease the expression of a dedifferentiation marker,
and gain morphological and biological characteristics of
differentiation. Also, we report that CD44+ cells are a
heterogeneous population that includes variable amounts
of CD133+ and EpCAM+ cells. Based on these data, we
demonstrated in vivo that CD44 is an efficient target for
treating PDAC relapse, but not primary PDAC tumors.

old nude mice (Swiss Nude Mouse Crl: NU(lco)-Foxn1nu,
Charles River Laboratories) Tumor size and body weights
of all animals were measured weekly. Subcutaneous tumor
measurements were undertaken using calipers and values
were calculated as (length x width2)/2. Gemcitabine (Lilly)
treatment was administered twice weekly (100 mg/kg i.p.)
until the tumor size was reduced by half or until the end
of an 80 day experimental period. Following treatment,
the tumor was allowed to grow for 15 additional days. For
anti-CD44 treatment, anesthetized mice were administered
purified whole mAbs against CD44 or nonspecific IgG
(vehicle), intravenously (200 µg/animal), twice weekly,
for 35 days after gemcitabine therapy [22].

Histology and immunohistochemistry
Tumoral sections were paraffin embedded
and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), alcian blue,
immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining
procedures were performed using standard protocols.
Sections (5μm) were probed with primary antibodies:
CD44 and EpCAM (BioLegends), CD133 (Merck
Millipore), ZEB1 (Santa Cruz), MUC1 (Abcam) and
PCNA (DAKO). Alexa Flour 488 and 594 (Invitrogen)
were used as secondary antibodies. CD44 was probed
on paraffin embedded human PDAC samples using
DAKO EnVision+System-HRP (DAB) for mouse
primary antibodies. For immunofluorescence, samples
were mounted in ProLong Antifade Reagent with DAPI
(Invitrogen) and examined with an Eclipse 90i Nikon
microscope (Nikon Instruments Europe B.V., Champignysur-Marne, France).

METHODS
Tumor samples
Patients were recruited for this study under the Paoli
Calmettes Institute clinical trial number 2011-A01439-32.
After patient’s informed consent had been obtained, excess
tissue samples from resected PDACs were collected
for xenograft procedures. Briefly, excess tumor tissue
samples, obtained during routine resections, performed
by surgeons, and not required for clinical diagnoses,
were subsequently implanted into immunocompromised
mice. Patient anonymity was maintained by removing
any information which identified, or could lead to the
identification of the patient.

Immunoblotting
Protein extraction was performed, on ice, using
total protein extraction buffer: 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5),
150 mM NaCl, 20% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA,
10% glycerol, 1% Triton, 25 mM NaF, 10 mM ZnCl2 and
50 mM DTT. Before lysis, protease inhibitor cocktail at
1:200 (Sigma-Aldrich; NUPR1340), 500 mM PMSF, 1
mM sodium orthovanadate and 1 mM β-glycerophosphate
were added. Protein concentrations were measured using
a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce Biotechnology). Protein
samples (80 mg) were denatured at 95°C and subsequently
separated by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. After being
transferred to nitrocellulose, the membrane was blocked
with 1% BSA, and the samples were probed with primary
antibody, followed by a horseradish peroxidase-coupled
(HRP) secondary antibody. β-Tubulin antibody was used
as a loading control. A complete list of the antibodies used
is included in Supplemental Table S1.

Animal experiments
All animal experiments were conducted in
accordance with institutional guidelines and were
approved by the “Plateforme de Stabulation et
d’Expérimentation Animale” (PSEA, Scientific Park of
Luminy, Marseille). Briefly, a total number of 7 human
PDAC xenografts were established (Table 1). Tumor
specimens (100 mm3), from resected PDAC patients, were
mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and implanted
subcutaneously on the upper right flank of 5- to 6-weekwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CO2 incubator. Cells were weaned from antibiotics at least
48 h before performing tests.

The hybridoma (ref. ATCC PTA-9008) derived
CD44-specific monoclonal antibody was purchased from
ATCC (France) and the mAbs were purified on protein
G-sepharose (Pierce Chemical). Reagents used for in vivo
treatment were diluted in PBS and sterilized using a sterile
0.22 µm pore-size filter.

Chemograms
Cell chemosensitivity was assessed using 5
drugs commonly used to treat patients with PDAC,
namely gemcitabine (Lilly), 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (Teva
Pharma), oxaliplatin (Hospira), docetaxel (TXT) (SanofiAventis), and an irinotecan active metabolite, 7-Ethyl
10-Hydroxycamptothecin or SN-38 (Sigma Aldrich). Five
thousand cells per well were plated in 96-wells plates
in SFD media. Twenty four hours later the media was
supplemented with increasing concentrations of drugs (0
to 1000 µM and 0 to 100 µM for SN-38), and incubated
for an additional 72 h period. Each experiment was done
in triplicate and repeated at least two times. Cell viability
was estimated after incubation with the PrestoBlue reagent
(Life Technologies) for 3 h, following the PrestoBlue cell
viability reagent protocol provided by the supplier.

Human PDAC samples
Tumor samples from 2 PDAC patients, treated
with gemcitabine, were obtained by surgery, before
and after treatment. A further 15 PDAC samples were
obtained following surgery of untreated or chemotherapy
treated patients, from the Pathology Department of the
Hôpital Nord and Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille,
France. All samples were embedded in paraffin and
immunohistochemistry staining was performed on 5-μm
sections, using the anti-CD44 antibody (BioLegends),
following standard procedures.

Statistical analysis

Flow cytometry

Results for continuous variables are expressed
as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Overall
comparisons of continuous variables were performed
using the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, and nonnormal distribution, unpaired data were assessed using
the Mann-Whitney test. All tests of significance were twotailed and the level of significance was set at 0.05. All data
are representative of at least two independent experiments.

To characterize pancreatic cancer stem cells, the
following antibodies were used: anti-CD44-APC, antiEpCAM-VioBlue, anti-CD24-PE (MACS, Miltenyi
Biotec) or appropriate isotype-matched control antibodies,
and the ALDEFLUOR-FITC (ALDH-FITC) assay (Stem
Cell Technologies, Vancouver, CA). For the ALDEFLUOR
reaction, cells were diluted in ALDEFLUOR reaction
buffer at a concentration of 1x106 cells per ml. Controls
contained both ALDH reagent and the inhibitor
diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB). Another set of
controls contained ALDEFLOUR alone. The reactions
were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. To set the gates for FACS
analysis, one control had no ALDEFLUOR or antibody
staining. Another control contained either secondary
antibody staining alone or ALDEFLUOR+DEAB to set
the gates for nonspecific staining. Samples were analyzed
by flow cytometry, using a MACSQuant VYB flow
cytometer (Miltenyi Biotec), and data were analyzed with
FlowJo 9.4.4 (Treestar, Ashland, Oregon).
