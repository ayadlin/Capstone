Abstract
Dysregulated fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of human
cancers. Aberrant activation of FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2) signaling, through overexpression of FGFR2 and/or its
ligands, mutations, and receptor amplification, has been found in a variety of human tumors. We generated
monoclonal antibodies against the extracellular ligand-binding domain of FGFR2 to address the role of FGFR2
in tumorigenesis and to explore the potential of FGFR2 as a novel therapeutic target. We surveyed a broad
panel of human cancer cell lines for the dysregulation of FGFR2 signaling and discovered that breast and
gastric cancer cell lines harboring FGFR2 amplification predominantly express the IIIb isoform of the receptor.
Therefore, we used an FGFR2-IIIb–specific antibody, GP369, to investigate the importance of FGFR2 signaling
in vitro and in vivo. GP369 specifically and potently suppressed ligand-induced phosphorylation of FGFR2-IIIb
and downstream signaling, as well as FGFR2-driven proliferation in vitro. The administration of GP369 in mice
significantly inhibited the growth of human cancer xenografts harboring activated FGFR2 signaling. Our findings support the hypothesis that dysregulated FGFR2 signaling is one of the critical oncogenic pathways
involved in the initiation and/or maintenance of tumors. Cancer patients with aberrantly activated/amplified
FGFR2 signaling could potentially benefit from therapeutic intervention with FGFR2-targeting antibodies.

Introduction
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling regulates many
fundamental biological processes including embryogenesis,
tissue and stem cell maintenance, angiogenesis, and wound
healing (1–3). The pleiotropic effects of FGFs are mediated
through four highly conserved receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTK), namely, FGF receptors 1 to 4 (FGFR1–FGFR4; ref. 3).
The extracelluar domain of these receptors contains three
immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains (D1, D2, and D3). The
second and third Ig domains are critical for ligand binding
and specificity, whereas the first Ig domain, absent in certain
isoforms, is thought to have an autoinhibitory function.
Alternative splicing of the carboxyl half of the third Ig domain
yields either the IIIb or the IIIc isoform of FGFR1 to FGFR3

(2, 3). These various isoforms of FGFRs exhibit tissue-specific
expression and respond to a different spectrum of the 18 mammalian FGFs (1). For example, FGFR2-IIIb, normally expressed
on epithelial cells, can be activated by FGFs of mesenchymal
origin, whereas FGFR2-IIIc expressed on mesenchymal tissues
responds to ligands secreted by epithelial cells (4, 5).
FGFs initiate intricate and highly regulated signaling
events by forming a ternary complex with their cognate
receptors and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (1, 2). This results in trans-autophosphorylation of FGFRs at intracellular
tyrosine residues and the activation of downstream signaling.
One key molecule involved in FGF signaling is FGFR substrate 2α (FRS2α), which, when phosphorylated by activated
FGFRs, can recruit other protein complexes to stimulate
the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase and/or phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/Akt signaling networks (1–3). The
cellular response to the activated FGF signaling is tissue specific, ranging from proliferation and motility to growth arrest,
apoptosis, and differentiation (3).
Dysregulated autocrine and paracrine activation of FGFRs
has been reported in a variety of human cancers. A wealth of
evidence also supports a critical role of aberrant FGFR2 signaling in cancer, including overexpression of FGFR2 and its
ligands, mutations and amplifications of the receptor, and receptor isoform switching. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNP) of FGFR2 are associated with an increased risk of

In vivo Efficacy of GP369 in FGFR2-Amplified Tumors

breast cancer development, presumably due to elevated
FGFR2 expression (6–8). Potentially activating missense mutations of FGFR2 have been reported in multiple cancer
types, including endometrial, ovarian, breast, lung, and gastric cancers (3, 9–14). Furthermore, the FGFR2 gene is amplified in a subset of gastric and breast cancers (3, 15–21). The
coexpression of FGFR2-IIIb and its ligand, FGF7, in pancreatic and gastric cancers, as well as in lung adenocarcinomas,
is associated with poor prognosis (22–24), likely due to aberrant receptor activation through the formation of an autocrine activation loop. Paradoxically, FGFR2 has also been
implicated as a tumor suppressor gene. For example, lossof-function mutations have been detected in melanomas
(25). Decreased expression of FGFR2-IIIb has been reported
in several cancer types during tumor progression (3, 26–29),
possibly reflecting the physiologic role of FGFR2 in regulating
tissue homeostasis (30, 31). These contrasting and contextdependent roles of FGFR2 signaling underscore the complexity of FGFR2 signaling.
To address the role of FGFR2 in tumorigenesis and to explore FGFR2 as a potential therapeutic target, we generated
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against the extracellular ligandbinding domain of FGFR2. Here, we describe the in vitro and
in vivo biological activities of GP369, an FGFR2-IIIb isoformspecific mAb, on human cancer cell lines with FGFR2 dysregulation. GP369 inhibited the ligand-induced phosphorylation of
FGFR2 and its downstream signaling, as well as the proliferation driven by FGFR2 overexpression. Administration of
GP369 in mice inhibited the in vivo growth of human cancer
xenografts harboring FGFR2 amplification. These findings
support the hypothesis that dysregulated FGFR2 signaling is
one of the many critical tumorigenesis pathways in human
cancers. Targeted therapy using FGFR2 mAb could be beneficial for patients with aberrantly activated/amplified FGFR2
signaling.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
KATO III, HEC-1-A, AN3 CA, SNU-16, and human lung cancer cell lines were acquired from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). FDCP-1, Ba/F3, MFM-223, and endometrial cancer cell lines were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures. All human cell
lines were cultured according to the suppliers' recommendations . FGFs were purchased from R&D Systems. 3-(4,5Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
and heparin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Screening for functional FGFR2 antibodies
Mice were immunized with a 1:1 mixture of human FGFR2
D2-D3 (IIIb) and D2-D3 (IIIc)-human Fc fusion proteins (see
Supplementary Methods for more detailed description). Hybridoma supernatants were screened by MTT assays using
FDCP cells expressing FGFR2-IIIb or FGFR2-IIIc in a 96-well
plate (70,000 cells per well) with FGF1 (8 ng/mL) and heparin
(5 μg/mL).

Epitope mapping of GP369
To determine the epitope of GP369, binding to FGFR2 peptides was measured by biolayer interferometry using an Octet
QK instrument (ForteBio). Ten overlapping peptides spanning
the COOH terminus of the third Ig domain of human FGFR2IIIb were synthesized and biotinylated at their NH2 termini.
FGFR2 peptides (1 μmol/L) and a negative control peptide,
E2 (1 μmol/L) were captured on streptavidin Octet biosensors.
Sensograms were recorded when peptide-loaded biosensors
were incubated with GP369 (1 μmol/L) in Octet sample diluent.
Proliferation assay
For SUM52PE proliferation assay, the cells were seeded in
96-well plates at 5,000 cells per well in growth medium [Ham's
F-12, 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 μg/mL insulin, and 1 μg/mL
hydrocortisone] and cultured overnight to allow for adherence.
Cells were then incubated in reduced-serum medium (Ham's
F-12 with 0.5% FBS) and treated with either a control mouse
IgG1 (mIgG; Bio X Cell) or GP369 at various concentrations
for 5 days. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assays. For
MCF7 proliferation assay, the cells were seeded in 96-well plates
at 10,000 cells per well in complete growth medium (DMEM
with 10% FBS) and cultured overnight to allow for adherence.
Cells were then incubated in serum-free medium for 24 hours,
followed by treatment with various amounts of mouse IgG
or GP369 in the absence or presence of FGF7 (25 ng/mL) for
3 days. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assays.
Xenograft studies
All mice were treated in accordance with the OLAW Public
Health Service Policy on Human Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals as well as the ILAR Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. In the SNU-16 in vivo studies, 10-week-old
female C.B-17 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice
(Taconic) were inoculated s.c. into the flank with 5 × 106 cells
in 1:1 RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen)/Matrigel (BD Biosciences).
Tumor measurements were taken twice weekly using vernier
calipers. Tumor volume was estimated using the following
formula: V = 0.5 × width × width × length. When tumors
approached ∼200 mm3, mice were randomized into groups
of 10 animals each and received GP369 (2–20 mg/kg) or a
control mIgG at 20 mg/kg twice weekly by i.p. injection. For
the MFM-223 in vivo studies, 5-week-old female NCr nude
mice (Taconic) were implanted s.c. on the left flank with
0.72 mg of 90-day-release 17β-estradiol pellets (Innovative
Research) and inoculated s.c. into the right flank with 107
MFM-223 cells in 1:1 EMEM (ATCC)/Matrigel. When tumors
approached ∼200 mm3, mice were randomized into groups of
10 animals each and treated with 20 mg/kg of mIgG or GP369
by i.p. injection twice weekly. All statistical analysis was done
using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison test.

was subsequently detected in a number of other cell lines,
including gastric cancer cell lines, SNU-16 and Ocum2M (33),
and a breast cancer cell line, SUM52PE (15, 34). We queried the
Sanger Institute SNP array-based gene copy number database
to identify additional FGFR2-amplified human cancer cell lines.
A few candidate cell lines with potential FGFR2 amplification
were found, including the breast cancer cell line MFM-223
and the endometrial cancer cell line MFE-280. Quantitative
PCR on genomic DNA revealed 287 copies of FGFR2 in MFM223 (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table S1). However, there was no
discernable alteration in the FGFR2 copy number in MFE-280.
Consistent with previous reports, SUM52PE, KATO III, and
SNU-16 exhibited dramatic copy number gains of FGFR2.
SNP array profiles for MFM-223 and SNU-16 suggest that
FGFR2 amplification in these cells is focal (data not shown).
We also surveyed FGFR copy number in a dozen human
endometrial and lung cancer cell lines, some of which also
exhibited increased copy number in various FGFR genes
(Supplementary Table S1).
The expression levels of FGFRs in the cell lines with FGFR2 amplification were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-

PCR (RT-PCR). Abundant FGFR2 transcripts, predominantly
the IIIb isoform, were detected in all four FGFR2-amplified cell
lines (Fig. 1B). In addition, these cell lines also express high
levels of FGFR2 protein as detected by Western blot analysis
(data not shown) and flow cytometry (Fig. 1C).
Identification and characterization of FGFR2
antagonistic antibodies
To investigate the role of dysregulated FGFR2 signaling in
tumor cell lines with FGFR2 amplification, FGFR2-specific
monoclonal antibodies were generated. To establish cellbased assays to screen for functional FGFR2 antibodies, we
first engineered interleukin-3 (IL-3)–dependent murine Ba/F3
(pro-B) and FDCP-1 (bone marrow) cells to express wild-type
(WT) and cancer-associated mutant variants of FGFR2. Previous studies have shown that ectopic expression of FGFRs in
these cells confers FGF1-dependent proliferation in the absence of IL-3 (4, 5). As expected, there was no detectable proliferation of FDCP-1 cells stably expressing WT FGFR2 in the
absence of IL-3 and FGF1 (data not shown). It is known that
FGF1, FGF3, FGF7, FGF10, and FGF22 transduce signals

Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using primers specific for FGFRs and HPRT. The expression levels were normalized to HPRT. C, FGFR2 cell surface

cytometer (Beckman Coulter).

In vivo Efficacy of GP369 in FGFR2-Amplified Tumors

Figure 2. Epitope mapping of GP369. A, specific binding of GP369 to human and mouse FGFR2-IIIb. The extracellular domains of human FGFR2-IIIb,
human FGFR2-IIIc, mouse FGFR2-IIIb, and human Jag-1 (control) were expressed as human Fc fusion proteins and captured on anti-hFc Octet biosensors
(ForteBio). Sensograms were recorded when the loaded biosensors were incubated with GP369 in Octet sample diluent (ForteBio). B, epitope mapping.

D, peptide sequences used for epitope mapping. The residues in human FGFR2-IIIb that differ from FGFR2-IIIc are in red. The amino acids involved in

through FGFR2-IIIb, whereas FGFR2-IIIc responds to a broader panel of ligands including FGF1, FGF2, FGF4, FGF6, FGF9,
FGF16, FGF17, FGF18, and FGF20 (4, 5). Similarly, the proliferation of FDCP-1 cells expressing the IIIb isoform of FGFR2 was
stimulated by FGF7 and FGF10 but not by FGF2 and FGF9,
whereas the proliferation of those expressing the IIIc isoform
was enhanced by FGF2 and FGF9 specifically (Supplementary
Fig. S1).
Antibody-secreting hybridomas were generated from mice
immunized with the extracellular domain of human FGFR2.
Primary screens using the engineered FDCP-1 cell lines identified a highly potent and selective isoform-specific FGFR2 mAb,
GP369, which exhibited marked inhibition of proliferation
driven by the IIIb isoform, but not the IIIc isoform, of FGFR2.
Octet analysis revealed specific binding of GP369 to human and mouse FGFR2-IIIb, but not to human FGFR2-IIIc
or a negative control protein, human Jag1 (Fig. 2A). Surface
plasmon resonance confirmed that GP369 exhibited similar

www.aacrjournals.org

affinity toward murine, cynomolgus, and human FGFR2-IIIb
Fc fusion proteins. No binding to human FGFR2-IIIc, FGFR1IIIb, or FGFR3-IIIb was detected (data not shown). These results show that GP369 is an isoform-specific antibody that
binds to FGFR2-IIIb from mouse to human.
To understand the molecular interaction between GP369
and FGFR2-IIIb, we tested the binding of GP369 to 10 overlapping peptides covering the COOH-terminal half of the
third Ig domain of human FGFR2-IIIb, as this is the only region that differs between the IIIb and IIIc forms. Peptides 4, 5,
and 6 showed strong binding to GP369 (Fig. 2B), whereas the
seven neighboring peptides did not exhibit any significant
binding to GP369 (Fig. 2B). The crystallographic structure of
FGFR2-IIIb complexed with FGF10 has revealed critical residues within FGFR2-IIIb involved in direct binding with
FGF10 (35). The GP369 binding epitope contains some of these
residues important for ligand binding (Fig. 2C). For example,
Ser-315, Gly-316, and Ala-322 form hydrogen bonds with

FGF10, whereas Ile-317 contacts FGF10 via hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, binding of GP369 to FGFR2-IIIb is likely to
directly block ligand-receptor interaction.
GP369 inhibits WT and cancer-relevant mutant
FGFR2-IIIb–driven proliferation
We quantified the potency of GP369 by using FDCP-1 cells
expressing either the IIIb or IIIc isoform of FGFR2. GP369
significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the proliferation of FDCP-1 cells driven by FGFR2-IIIb (with an average IC50 of ∼1.4 nmol/L) but not by FGFR2-IIIc (Fig. 3A).
Breast and gastric cancer cell lines, such as SUM52PE and
KATO III, express a COOH-terminally truncated variant of
FGFR2 with increased transforming activity due to constitutive phosphorylation of FRS2 and activation of downstream
signaling (36, 37). GP369 also effectively suppressed the proliferation of FDCP-1 cells driven by this truncated FGFR2
variant (Fig. 3A).
Mutations in FGFR2 have been detected in many cancers,
including about 12% of endometrial tumors (11, 13). Two of
the most common mutations in endometrial tumors are
S252W, a mutation in the linker region between D2 and
D3, which alters ligand specificity and increases the affinity
of ligand binding, and N550K, a catalytic domain mutation

that enhances kinase activity. GP369 markedly inhibited
proliferation driven by both the FGFR2-IIIb S252W and
N550K mutant variants with IC50 values of 4.4 and 4.5 nmol/L,
respectively (Fig. 3A).
To examine the effect of GP369 on human cancer cell lines
with FGFR2 dysregulation in vitro, we selected two breast
cancer cell lines, SUM52PE and MCF7, for further analysis.
Both cell lines express FGFR2; however, SUM52PE harbors
FGFR2 amplification whereas MCF7 does not. The in vitro
proliferation of SUM52PE was not further stimulated by
FGF7, an FGFR2-IIIb–specific ligand (data not shown), likely
due to the constitutive activation of FGFR2 signaling in these
cells. Nevertheless, GP369 significantly blocked the proliferation of SUM52PE in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). In
contrast, the in vitro proliferation of MCF7 was stimulated
by FGF7, and GP369 effectively blocked the FGF7-induced
proliferation of these cells (Fig. 3C).
While surveying additional human cancer cell lines with
FGFR2 dysregulation, we found that a non–small cell lung
cancer cell line, HCC95, expressed high levels of FGFR2 in
the absence of FGFR2 amplification. HCC95 cells formed
large colonies in soft agar; therefore, we tested the effect of
GP369 on the growth of these cells in soft agar. For comparison, we also tested GP369 on an FGFR2-amplified cell line,

COOH-terminally truncated IIIb isoform, or the S252W and N550K mutant variants in the presence of FGF1 (8 ng/mL) and heparin (5 μg/mL). MTT assays
were carried out after 2 d. B, inhibition of the proliferation of SUM52PE cells by GP369. The cells were incubated in reduced serum medium (0.5% FBS) and

C, inhibition of the FGF7-induced proliferation of MCF7 cells by GP369. The cells were incubated in serum-free medium and were either left untreated
(medium) or treated with mIgG or GP369 at 30 μg/mL for 3 d in the absence or presence of FGF7 (25 ng/mL). Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assays.

Ba/F3 cells overexpressing FGFR2-IIIb. After 3 h of serum starvation, the cells were treated with PBS (mock) or 5 μg/mL of either mIgG or GP369 for 1 h
at 37°C before stimulation by FGF7 (20 ng/mL) and heparin (5 μg/mL) for 15 min. The protein lysates were analyzed by Western blot. B, GP369 blocks

blotting analysis was then carried out. C, downregulation of the FGFR2 protein levels by GP369. SNU-16 cells were treated with 10 μg/mL of either
mIgG or GP369. The cells were harvested at various time points. Total levels of FGFR2 and β-tubulin were determined by Western blotting, and
densitometric units quantified using Scion Image software.

KATO-III. In the presence of a control mIgG, both HCC95
and KATO-III cells formed large colonies in soft agar, whereas the addition of GP369 significantly inhibited the size as
well as the number of colonies (Supplementary Fig. S3).
GP369 suppresses FGFR2 phosphorylation and
downstream signaling
We have also investigated the effect of GP369 on the signaling cascades activated by FGFR2. FGF7 induced tyrosine
phosphorylation of FGFR2 and led to the subsequent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2)
in both Ba/F3 cells overexpressing FGFR2-IIIb (Fig. 4A) and
FGFR2-amplified SNU-16 cells (Fig. 4B). GP369 effectively inhibited the ligand-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FGFR2
and activation of ERK1/2 in these cells (Fig. 4A and B). Tyrosine phosphorylation of FRS2, a key molecule connecting
FGFR to downstream signaling pathways, was also attenuated

www.aacrjournals.org

in SNU-16 cells treated with FGF7 (Fig. 4B). In addition, GP369
downregulated the FGFR2 protein level in SNU-16 cells
(Fig. 4C). An approximately 40% decrease in the FGFR2 protein level is noticeable 2 hours after incubation with the
GP369 antibody, and there was a >60% reduction in the FGFR2
protein level after 6 hours.
GP369 inhibits the in vivo growth of cancer xenografts
with activated FGFR2 signaling
To assess the functional activity of GP369 in vivo, we evaluated the effect of the antibody on the growth of human cancer xenografts harboring FGFR2 amplification. Of the four
FGFR2-amplified cell lines examined, only SNU-16 and
MFM-223 cells formed tumors in mice; thus, the efficacy of
GP369 was tested against these two xenografts.
SNU-16 xenograft tumors were treated with a control
mIgG at 20 mg/kg or GP369 at 2, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg. GP369

treatment showed potent tumor growth inhibition when
compared with mIgG-treated controls at all doses evaluated
(P < 0.001; Fig. 5A). Strikingly, the tyrosine phosphorylation
of FGFR2 was barely detectable in GP369-treated tumors
(Fig. 5B). Consistent with in vitro studies, GP369 reduced
the total FGFR2 protein in tumors (Fig. 5B). In contrast to
the in vitro phospho-RTK profile of SNU-16 cells, which exhibited multiple RTKs with high levels of tyrosine phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S4A), FGFR2 was the dominant
tyrosine-phosphorylated receptor detected in SNU-16 xenografts treated with a control mIgG (Fig. 5C). A phosphoRTK array confirmed specific inhibition of FGFR2 tyrosine
phosphorylation in SNU-16 xenografts by GP369 (Fig. 5C).
The predominant high-level tyrosine phosphorylation of
FGFR2 in SNU-16 cells in vivo might account for the dependence of SNU-16 xenografts on activated FGFR2 signaling as
well as their exquisite sensitivity to GP369 treatment.
We next tested the effect of GP369 on the in vivo growth of
the breast cancer cell line MFM-223. Tumor stasis was
achieved in MFM-223 xenografts treated with 20 mg/kg
GP369 twice weekly throughout the study (P = 0.0015; Fig. 6A).

Similar to what we observed in the SNU-16 xenograft study,
GP369 drastically decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation
of FGFR2, concomitant with a reduction in the total FGFR2
protein in the tumors (Fig. 6B).
The high-affinity binding of GP369 to murine FGFR2-IIIb
also allowed us to examine the potential toxicity of targeting
FGFR2-IIIb in mice. All treatments were well tolerated without visible signs of toxicity in both xenograft models.

Discussion
The success of mAbs such as trastuzumab and cetuximab
as cancer therapeutics has generated great interest in the development of additional antibodies that bind to new RTK targets or novel epitopes of known targets (38). Dysregulated
FGFR signaling has been associated with the development
of many human malignancies. Therefore, antibodies targeting individual FGFRs could have broad clinical applications.
The frequent dysregulation of FGFR signaling in human
cancers suggests that targeting and inhibiting individual FGF

In vivo Efficacy of GP369 in FGFR2-Amplified Tumors

and phage display–based approaches have been used to
identify functional blocking antibodies against FGFRs. Using
phage display, Sun and colleagues identified antibodies
targeting FGFR1, as well as the IIIb and IIIc isoforms of
the receptor. Unexpectedly, administration of pan-FGFR1or FGFR1-IIIc–specific antibodies in mice resulted in significant weight loss (39). Therefore, the efficacy of these antibodies against human cancer xenografts cannot be adequately
assessed in mice. We and others have successfully identified
FGFR3 antagonistic antibodies using either immunization
and/or phage display methods (40–42). FGFR3 mAbs have
been shown to exhibit potent antitumor activities in preclinical models of bladder carcinoma and multiple myeloma
with t (4;14) translocation (40–42), highlighting the therapeutic potential of targeting aberrant FGFR3 signaling in
cancers. Although antibodies targeting FGFR1 and FGFR3
have been successfully identified, based on our experience,
it is challenging to generate functional blocking antibodies
against FGFR2 and FGFR4. This is likely due to the high
sequence homology between the mouse and human
protein and/or the lack of immunogenicity of the ligandbinding domains of these two receptors. In particular, the
ligand-binding domains of the mouse and human FGFR2
share approximately 98% sequence identity. To our knowledge, FGFR2- or FGFR4-targeting antibodies that exhibit
antitumor activity in vivo have not been previously reported
in the literature.
To address the role of FGFR2 in tumorigenesis and to explore the therapeutic potential of FGFR2-targeting mAbs, we
generated antibodies that specifically inhibit the function of
FGFR2 after several attempts of immunizations. We identified FGFR2-amplified cell lines that represent gastric and
breast cancers, the tumor types known to harbor FGFR2
amplification. We also identified a number of breast cancer
cell lines overexpressing FGFR2 in the absence of receptor
amplification. Because these cell lines predominantly express

the IIIb isoform of FGFR2, we tested the effect of an FGFR2IIIb–specific antibody, GP369, on these cells in vitro and
in vivo. GP369 potently blocked FGFR2 signaling and proliferation driven by FGFR2 overexpression. In addition, GP369
consistently inhibited the in vivo growth of FGFR2-amplified
SNU-16 and MFM-223 xenografts.
FGFR2 amplification was previously detected in approximately 3% to 10% of gastric cancers and is associated with
a poorly differentiated subtype with poor prognosis (18–21).
A recent report showed that up to 25% of gastric cancer
patients had FGFR2 copy number greater than 3 (43). Previously, a multikinase small-molecule inhibitor, AZD2171, was
reported to have antitumor activity against gastric cancer
xenografts overexpressing FGFR2 (44). However, due to the
broad spectrum of targets modulated by AZD2171, the in vivo
growth inhibitory activity of this molecule could also be attributed to the suppression of other kinases, in addition to FGFR2.
The sensitivity of FGFR2-amplified SNU-16 xenografts to the
FGFR2-IIIb– specific mAb reported here supports an essential
role of FGFR2 in tumorigenesis and thus provides a rationale
for targeting FGFR2 in gastric cancer patients with FGFR2
amplification.
Gastric cancer patients with FGFR2-IIIb and FGF7 doublepositive tumors had much worse prognosis in comparison
with those with single-positive or double-negative tumors
(24), suggesting the possible involvement of an FGFR2-IIIb/
FGF7 autocrine activation loop in a subset of advanced gastric cancer tumors. The therapeutic potential of targeting the
activated FGFR2 signaling in these tumors should be further
explored. Gastric cancer is the second most lethal cancer,
with 900,000 new cases each year. In a substantial portion
of these tumors, the FGFR2 pathway is dysregulated, representing a significant clinical opportunity for FGFR2 inhibitory antibodies.
The in vivo activity of GP369 against two FGFR2-amplified
cancer cell lines with different tissue origins suggests that

FGFR2 amplification may be a common key oncogenic event
in a subset of human tumors. Therefore, antibody-based
FGFR2 targeting in the subtypes of human cancers harboring
FGFR2 amplification could have clinical benefits. This hypothesis should be tested in additional human cancer xenografts as well as primary tumors with FGFR2 amplification.
Recently, Turner and colleagues reported that FGFR2 amplification was found exclusively in 4% of estrogen receptor,
progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 triple-negative breast cancers (17). They also classified MFM-223 as an FGFR2-amplified triple-negative cell
line. However, low level of estrogen receptor expression was
detected in MFM-223 (45), and more importantly, we found
that the in vivo growth of MFM-223 xenografts was dependent
on 17β-estradiol (data not shown). Therefore, FGFR2 amplification in breast cancers may not be exclusively present in the triple-negative subtype. It is also worth noting that MFM-223 cells
contain a mutation in PIK3CA (Sanger Cancer Genome Project)
that leads to activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, as confirmed
by constitutive phosphorylation of Akt (data not shown). Nevertheless, MFM-223 xenografts were still sensitive to GP369,
suggesting that constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt
pathway is not sufficient to abrogate the therapeutic response
to antibodies targeting FGFR2, which lies upstream of
the pathway.
In addition, using a genetically engineered mouse model,
we showed that overexpression of FGFR2-IIIb is sufficient
to drive tumorigenesis (46), and GP369 can effectively block
the growth of these engineered tumors driven by FGFR2
overexpression (data not shown). Therefore, we believe that

FGFR2-targeting antibodies have therapeutic potential in
cancers with FGFR2 dysregulation in the absence of receptor
amplification.
FGFR2 mutations have been found in a variety of tumors.
In particular, approximately 12% of endometrial cancers contain mutations in FGFR2. Because GP369 can inhibit two of
the most common FGFR2 mutations found in these tumors,
we will use GP369 to determine whether the in vivo tumorigenesis of these cancer cells is dependent on these FGFR2
activating mutations.
In this article, using an antibody specific for the IIIb isoform of FGFR2, we showed that FGFR2 signaling is one of the
important pathways involved in the pathogenesis of human
cancers. Our findings provide a rationale for clinically testing
the therapeutic potential of FGFR2 antagonistic antibodies in
human cancers with activated/amplified FGFR2 signaling.
