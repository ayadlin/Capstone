BACKGROUND: This analysis of the myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) Landmark survey evaluated gaps between patient
perceptions of their disease management and physician self-reported practices. METHODS: The survey included 813 patient
respondents who had MPNs (myelofibrosis [MF], polycythemia vera [PV], or essential thrombocythemia [ET]) and 457 hematologist/
oncologist respondents who treated patients with these conditions. RESULTS: Greater proportions of physician respondents reported
using prognostic risk classifications (MF, 83%; PV, 59%; ET, 77%) compared with patient recollections (MF, 54%; PV, 17%; ET, 31%).
Most physician respondents reported that their typical symptom assessments included asking patients about the most important
symptoms or a full list of symptoms, whereas many patient respondents reported less specific assessments (eg, they were asked how
they were feeling). Many patient respondents did not recognize common symptoms as MPN-related. For example, approximately
one-half or more did not believe difficulty sleeping resulted from their MPN (MF, 49%; PV, 64%; ET, 76%). Physician respondents
underestimated the proportion of patients who had symptomatic PV or ET at diagnosis compared with patient respondents. There
was discordance regarding treatment goals: among patient respondents with MF or PV, “slow/delay progression of condition” was
the most important treatment goal, whereas physician respondents reported “symptom improvement” and “prevention of vascular/
thrombotic events,“ respectively. Finally, more than one-third of patient respondents were not “very satisfied” with their physician’s
overall management/communication. CONCLUSIONS: The care and satisfaction of patients with MPN may be improved with inC 2016 The Authors. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Discordance between patient and physician perceptions of disease burden has been identified in various hematology and
oncology disease settings and may affect patient outcomes. A recent systematic review of patient and physician perceptions
in oncology settings revealed that physicians often underestimate symptom prevalence and severity,1 which may delay or
hinder the alleviation of symptoms. When considering patients with prostate cancer, 1 study indicated that physicians
underestimated pain severity,2 which could compromise the ability to achieve improvements in quality of life (QoL).
Those investigators also reported that physician estimates regarding the effects of breast cancer on patient QoL, social
functioning, and role functioning differed from patient perceptions.2 In a third study, physicians overestimated the
burden of common treatment options for myelodysplastic syndrome compared with patient perceptions. Consequently,

physicians may have recommended treatment discontinuation because of inaccurate perceptions about treatment
effectiveness in their patients.3
Patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV), and essential
thrombocythemia (ET), have increased mortality rates4
and experience notable symptoms that negatively affect
QoL.5 However, limited data are available concerning
patient and physician perceptions about MPN symptomatology and treatment goals. Attempts to better understand these perceptions may lead to optimized patient
care and, ultimately, better patient outcomes.
The MPN Landmark survey was the first large
observational study to evaluate patient and physician perceptions about MPNs among contemporary populations
in the United States. The first report from the MPN
Landmark survey summarized patient-reported effects of
MPNs on overall health and productivity, but it did not
evaluate physician or patient respondent data concerning
treatment goals or satisfaction and did not make direct
comparisons between physician and patient respondent
perceptions.6 The objective of this second analysis of
MPN Landmark survey data was to identify gaps between patient respondent perceptions about their disease
management and physician respondent self-reported
practices regarding MPN-related prognostic risk assessment, symptom burden, treatment goals and expectations, and treatment satisfaction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population

Patients who were previously diagnosed with MF, PV, or
ET in the United States were eligible to participate in the
survey. Patient respondents were recruited through physician offices, advocacy groups, and the media, as previously
described.6 The study received approval from an internal
institutional review board at ICF International (Fairfax,
Va), which assisted in conducting the MPN Landmark
survey. All respondents provided informed consent.
A national sample of physicians in direct patient care
who specialized in hematology or oncology was drawn as
a national probability sample of these specialties from the
American Medical Association and American Osteopathic
Association databases and was contacted by mail, e-mail,
and fax. Those who met practice eligibility requirements
for the study were asked to participate in the MPN Landmark survey. Eligible physician respondents were those
who actively practiced in hematology or oncology settings
450

in the United States and had managed the care of 2
patients with MF,  5 patients with PV, or 5 patients
with ET within the 12 months before the survey. Physician respondents received modest remuneration for their
participation; patient respondents did not receive remuneration. The method of patient and physician respondent recruitment was not revealed to the investigators,
and the survey did not collect the method of respondent
recruitment.
Survey Instrument

Questionnaires specific to the MF, PV, and ET settings were
created for patient and physician respondents (6 surveys
total) and were conducted in English only. Some patient
survey questions related to MPN symptoms and QoL were
adapted from the MPN Symptom Assessment Form
(MPN-SAF)7 and the European Organization for Research
and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life QuestionnaireCore 30,8 which are validated survey instruments. However,
the MPN Landmark survey instruments were not validated.
The questionnaires, which respondents completed online,
included 59 to 65 multiple-choice questions (respondent/
disease dependent) and required 20 to 25 minutes to complete. The surveys included a core set of questions that required responses before submission. Partially completed
interviews were excluded from all analyses. A summary of
the physician survey is included in the online version of this
article (see online supporting information), and a summary
of the patient survey was described in a previous publication.6 The current report includes data from respondents
about: 1) demographics, 2) MPN prognostic risk assessment,
3) MPN symptom burden, 4) MPN treatment goals
and expectations, and 5) MPN treatment satisfaction.
Descriptive statistics were used for all analyses.

survey, depending on which MPN subtype-specific survey
they completed, and most reported treating patients in a
single-specialty group or an academic hospital. On average,
physicians reported treating between 11 and 20 patients
with MF, PV, or ET at the time of the survey.
Patient-Physician Comparisons: MPN Prognostic
Risk Assessment

Most physician respondents self-reported that they classified their patients according to prognostic risk categories
(MF, 83%; PV, 59%; ET, 77%). In contrast, notably
smaller proportions of patient respondents reported that
their diagnosing physician had stratified their MPN with
a prognostic risk score (MF, 54%; PV, 17%; ET, 31%).
Patient-Physician Comparisons: MPN
Symptom Burden

Patient respondent perceptions of physician management
differed from the management practices reported by physician respondents regarding symptom assessment and related communications (Table 3). Compared with patient
respondents, larger proportions of physician respondents
reported that their typical management practices included
asking patients about their most important MPN-related
symptoms during symptom assessment and referring to a
full list of symptoms when discussing potential symptoms
Cancer

and disease progression. In contrast, patient recollections
of physician visits suggest that physicians were less specific
(eg, they were most likely to simply ask how patient
respondents were feeling during symptom assessment).
Approximately 5% to 15% of patient respondents in each
MPN group reported that their physician was uninterested or did not ask about symptoms.
Patient respondents who reported experiencing
known MPN-related symptoms often did not recognize a
connection between the symptom and their MPN (Fig.
1). Historically, difficulty sleeping is 1 of the most frequent symptoms experienced by patients with MPNs12;
however, some patient respondents in the MPN Landmark survey who reported difficulty sleeping did not
think that their difficulty sleeping was related to their
MPN (MF, 49%; PV, 64%; ET, 76%). In contrast, many
physician respondents (MF, 53%; PV, 34%; ET, 25%)
reported that “all” or “almost all” of their patients recognized their symptoms as MPN-related. A considerable
proportion of patient respondents reported experiencing
symptoms at the time of diagnosis (MF, 81%; PV, 89%;
ET, 84%). However, physician respondent recall of newly
diagnosed patients with symptoms was markedly lower
for PV and ET: 50% who treated patients with PV estimated that 40% of their patients had no symptoms, and

The perceptions of patient and physician respondents

in the MF and PV settings; in contrast, physician respondents reported “symptom improvement” and “prevention of

vascular/thrombotic events” was the most important treatment goal for ET (patient respondents, 35%; physician
respondents, 57%); however, there remained notable discordance in the ET setting about other treatment goals.

(MF, 65%; PV, 31%) identified fatigue as the single symptom that patients would most like to resolve. Fatigue was
also chosen as the most important symptom or complication
by patient respondents (33%) and by a notable proportion
of physician respondents (22%) in the ET setting; however,
the largest subgroup of physician respondents (29%)
reported stroke as the single most important to resolve.
Discordance between patient and physician respondents concerning treatment needs and plans could limit patient compliance with prescribed treatment and, in turn,
clinical and QoL outcomes and patient satisfaction. More
than 75% of physician respondents in each group reported
that patients “sometimes” or “often” did not wish to comply with physicians’ primary treatment recommendation
(MF, 77%; PV, 84%; ET, 78%). Reasons for lack of patient compliance are unclear. However, some patient
respondents did not believe that their physician had a treatment plan (MF, 30%; PV, 27%; ET, 35%) or believed
that their physician was not providing updates regarding
new treatments (MF, 29%; PV, 37%; ET, 41%).
Patient Respondent MPN Treatment Satisfaction

Subgroups of patient respondents were dissatisfied with
the care they received from their physician. More than
one-third of patient respondents were not “very” satisfied
with their physician’s overall management of their disease,
and an additional subgroup was “somewhat” or “very”
dissatisfied (MF, 8%; PV, 10%; ET, 12%) (Fig. 4A).
Similarly, more than one-third of patient respondents
454

were not “very” satisfied with their physician’s communication about their disease, and an additional subgroup
was “somewhat” or “very” dissatisfied (MF, 9%; PV,
13%; ET, 16%) (Fig. 4B). Among patients who had
researched their condition (MF, 97%; PV, 96%; ET,
97%), the majority of patient respondents included the
Internet among the most helpful sources of information
about their diagnosis (MF, 90%; PV, 87%; ET, 89%),
with a minority including their physician’s office (MF,
26%; PV, 21%; ET, 20%). Approximately one-half of all
patient respondents reported that they had changed their
MPN physician (MF, 47%; PV, 46%; ET, 56%); the
most frequently reported reason for the change was dissatisfaction with prior care received (MF, 40%; PV, 37%;
ET, 33%).
DISCUSSION
Although several analyses in recent years have evaluated
MPN-related symptoms and effects on QoL,6,7,13-15 to
our knowledge, this is the first study in the MPN setting
to evaluate discordance in communication and perceptions between patients and physicians. This analysis of
MPN Landmark survey data identified several gaps between the perceptions of patient respondents with MPNs
and the self-reported practices of physician respondents
who treat patients with MPNs. Most physician respondents reported that their standard practices included classifying patients by prognostic risk, including patients with
PV and ET, which are disease settings that do not have

This was discordant with patient respondents, most of
whom did not recall receiving a prognostic risk score. In
the PV and ET settings, physician respondents underreCancer

ported the proportion of patients who experienced symptoms at diagnosis compared with patient respondents.
Furthermore, most patient respondents reported that
MPN-related symptoms negatively affected their QoL,

yet many physician respondents did not believe that patient QoL was reduced in the absence of splenomegaly. It
is challenging to put these data into context, because
splenomegaly rates were not captured by the MPN Landmark survey. However, the splenomegaly associated
symptoms of abdominal discomfort and early satiety occurred in 53% and 37% of patients with MF, respectively;
in 35% and 22% of those with PV, respectively; and in
31% and 21% of those with ET.6 Taken together, these
gaps in perception suggest a need for greater physician appreciation for the importance of MPN-related symptoms
from the perspective of patients. In addition, the median
time since diagnosis (MF, 4 years; PV and ET, 7 years)
was relatively recent for many patient respondents, suggesting that there may be a particular need for addressing
this issue among patients in the early stage of their disease.
Research in non-MPN disease settings suggests that
patient satisfaction may be improved with patient-centric
communication styles, which have been associated with
improvements in adherence, satisfaction, and overall
health in the primary care setting.16 A meta-analysis that
included patients and physicians from primary care and
specialty practice settings reported a significant correla456

tion between physician communication skill and patient
adherence.17 However, further research is necessary to determine whether these findings are applicable to MPN
settings.
This analysis of MPN Landmark survey data provides a basis for further strategies to close the gaps in perception between patients with MPNs and their managing
physicians in an effort to optimize patient care and satisfaction. First, improved patient education may better prepare patients to communicate key aspects of their disease
and manage treatment expectations. Many patient
respondents in the MPN Landmark survey did not recognize a connection between common MPN symptoms and
their MPN diagnosis. MPN-related symptoms have been
associated with reduced QoL,7,18 suggesting that there is
an opportunity to improve QoL in patients who may be
living with symptoms they do not realize are related to
MPN. In addition to educating patients on MPN symptoms, physicians should proactively assess symptoms with
early and regular use of formal patient-reported outcome
instruments (eg, MF Symptom Assessment Form,19
MPN-SAF,7 European Organization for Research and
Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core
Cancer

February 1, 2017

Landmark: Comparisons of MPN Symptoms/Mesa et al

308 to accurately capture symptom severity and guide
treatment decisions.
Second, many patient respondents reported slowing
disease progression as their primary treatment goal, although it has not been demonstrated that current treatment options delay MPN progression or cure MPNs. In
some instances, improved patient education is needed to
manage expectations and to help patients set achievable
goals. In agreement with studies of non-MPN patient
populations, clearer and more thorough physician communication may improve satisfaction among patients
with MPNs. Many patient respondents from the MPN
Landmark survey did not recall their physician discussing
their full disease burden, rather focusing on select symptoms or, in some patients, no symptoms.
Finally, limited availability and access to effective
treatment options that provide durable, clinically relevant
improvements in QoL may also be a contributor to the
observed discrepancies between patients and physicians.
Among patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the
increased effectiveness of new treatment options20 is
expected to correspond with improvements in healthrelated QoL.21 It is likely that the use of more effective
treatments in the MPN setting could yield similar improvements and enhance the alignment of patients and
physicians with regard to MPN symptomatology and
treatment goals.
Limitations of this analysis stem primarily from the
nature of the study. First, because patient responses were
based on their recollection and awareness of their MPN
management details, some differences may be the result of
patient error rather than a true disconnect with physicians.
Second, responses were not matched between physicians
and the specific patients under their care, which limits
how these data can be compared and interpreted. Third,
the low MPN prevalence rates in the general population
required nonprobability sampling methods for patient
respondents, which may have limited how representative
the MPN Landmark survey patient respondent population was of all US patients with MPNs. For example, patient respondents were primarily white and female and
had a high level of advanced education; however, it
remains unclear whether these characteristics are representative. The physician respondent population was recruited
based on a probability sample. However, there may have
been a self-selection bias regarding which physicians chose
to participate that may have influenced the sample sizes
for each MPN. Although physician respondents primarily
practiced in single-specialty groups or outpatient clinics
in academic hospitals, with relatively few from communiCancer

ty hospitals, multispecialty groups, health maintenance
organizations, or individual practices, this distribution of
practice settings may be representative.
Conclusions

This analysis of MPN Landmark survey data suggests that
patient and physician respondents often view the assessment of MPN prognosis, disease burden, and treatment
goals differently, with physician respondents overestimating the ability of patients to recognize symptoms as
MPN-related. Taken together, these findings suggest that
there is room for improved patient education in the MPN
setting. In particular, improved patient-physician communication regarding treatment goals and enhanced patient access to effective treatment options may improve
patient outcomes and overall treatment satisfaction.
