ABSTRACT:
Cheliensisine A (Chel A) as a novel styryl-lactone isolated from Goniothalamus
cheliensis Hu has been indicated to be a chemotherapeutic agent in Leukemia HL-60
cells. However, its potential for cancer treatment and the underlying mechanisms
are not deeply investigated to the best of our knowledge. Current studies showed
that Chel A could trigger p53-mediated apoptosis, accompanied with dramatically
inhibition of anchorage-independent growth of human colon cancer HCT116 cells.
Further studies found that Chel A treatment resulted in p53 protein stabilization and
accumulation via the induction of its phosphorylation at Ser20 and Ser15. Moreover,
Chel A-induced p53 protein accumulation and activation required ATR/Chk2 axis,
which is distinct from the mechanism that we have most recently identified the Chk1/
p53-dependent apoptotic response by Chel A in normal mouse epidermal Cl41 cells.
In addition, our results demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide generation induced by
Chel A acted as a precursor for all these signaling events and downstream biological
effects. Taken together, we have identified the Chel A as a new therapeutic agent,
which highlights its potential for cancer therapeutic effect.

INTRODUCTION

apoptosis affords a tempting approach to treat colon
cancer.
Cheliensisine A (Chel A) as a novel styryl-lactone
isolated from Goniothalamus cheliensis has been
demonstrated to be cytotoxic to human promyelocytic
leukemia HL-60 cells[4]. Mechanistic insight revealed
that this natural product could trigger apoptosis via
downregulation of Bcl-2 expression [5]. Furthermore, a
recent study in our laboratory has indicated the inhibitory
effect of Chel A on EGF-induced cell transformation
in JB6 Cl41 cells via the activation of p53-dependent
pathway [6]. Taken together, previous studies have
identified Chel A as a dual chemotherapeutic and

Cancers of the colon and rectum continue to be the
third most common fatal cancers in the United States, and
approximately account for 10% of the total cancer deaths
[1]. In an effort to fight against such diseases, targeted
cancer therapies, which normally employing drugs
block the growth of cancer by interfering with specific
molecules involved in tumor growth and progression,
turns out to be an effective strategy [2]. The p53 tumor
suppressor pathway is dysfunctional in some colorectal
cancers [3], and to this end, identification of therapeutics
that is capable of specifically re-activating p53-mediated

chemopreventive agent that could be potentially used
for cancer treatment and prevention. However, the effect
and mechanism of Chel A on colon cancer has not been
identified yet. Therefore, colon cancer HCT116 cells were
employed to evaluate the potential chemotherapeutic
effect of Chel A. Briefly, our results found that Chel A
was capable of activating p53-mediated apoptosis in
HCT116 cells, which in turn resulted in the inhibition of
anchorage-independent growth of HCT116 cells. Further
studies suggested that Chel A could stabilize and activate
p53 via the phosphorylation at Ser20 and Ser15, and its
activation could be via the binary pathways, i.e. ATR/
p53 signaling and ATR/Chk2/p53 axis. Finally, it was
found that hydrogen peroxide generation induced by Chel
A acted as a precursor for all these signaling events and

downstream biological effects. Collectively, this study
indicated the chemotherapeutic effect and the molecular
mechanisms underlying Chel A inhibition of colon cancer
anchorage-independent growth.

RESULTS
Chel A inhibited cell viability and anchorageindependent growth of colon cancer HCT116 cells.
Chel A has been shown possessing cytotoxicity in
human leukemia HL-60 cells [5]. However, the anti-cancer
activity of Chel A on colon cancer has not been explored

yet. Therefore, we first assessed the effect of Chel A on
cell viability of colon cancer cells using ATPase assay.
HCT116 colon cancer cell line was selected and cultured
with a range of Chel A doses (1.0-4.0 μM) for 48 hrs. As
shown in Fig. 1A, a significant reduction of cell viability
was observed in a dose-dependent manner, and IC50 of
Chel A on HCT116 cells was approximately 2.0 μM. Next,
soft agar assay was employed to determine the inhibitory
effect of Chel A on anchorage-independent growth
(colony formation). The results showed that anchorageindependent growth of HCT116 cells was significantly
inhibited following 4 μM Chel A treatment (Figs. 1B and
1C). These results clearly demonstrated the anti-cancer
effect of Chel A in human colon cancer cells.

cytometry assay to see if Chel A inhibited cell colony
formation via interfering with cell cycle progression in
HCT116 cells. The HCT116 cells were treated with Chel A
and cell death was examined by flow cytometry. As shown
in Fig. 1D, the HCT116 cells were treated with Chel A
at concentrations of 0, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 μM for 48 hrs.
High-resolution flow cytometric analysis of PI-stained
nuclei showed that sub-G1 DNA content (cell death peak)
at 48 hrs increased substantially compared to the negative
control in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1D), revealing
that Chel A’s inhibitory effect on cell colony formation
acted through inducing cell apoptosis rather than block
cell cycle progression. Considering that poly (ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) cleavage and caspase activation often
correlate with apoptosis [7], western blot analysis was
performed to check the induction of cleavage of caspase-3
and PARP. The data indicated that an increased cleavage of
caspase-3 and PARP was observed by Chel A in HCT116
cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1E). The induction
of apoptosis by Chel A was also extended to be determined
in human bladder cancer U5637 cells (Fig. 1F). These
results strongly demonstrated that Chel A treatment could
result in the caspase-dependent apoptosis in HCT116 cells.

Chel A treatment exerted its anti-cancer effect
via induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis in
HCT116 cells
Cancer therapeutic agents could exert their anticancer effect via either causing cell growth arrest or
inducing cancer cell apoptosis. Thus, we used flow

p53 was pivotal in Chel A-induced cell apoptosis

at Ser20 normally contributes to the stabilization of p53
protein [9], which in turn can induce the phosphorylation
at Ser15 [11], we anticipated that Chel A-induced p53
activation in HCT116 cells was likewise based on its
phosphorylation at Ser20.
In an effort to further substantiate if p53 activation
is necessary for Chel A-induced apoptosis, p53-/- HCT116
cells were employed. As shown in Fig. 2B, the apoptosis
induction by Chel A observed from flow cytometric
analysis was much lower in HCT116 p53-/- cells compared
to that in HCT116 cells with wild-type p53 cells. Further
Western blot analysis demonstrated that p53 knockout
was capable of blocking Chel A-induced cleavage of
PARP and caspase-3, suggesting that p53 activation was
critical for apoptotic induction by Chel A in HCT116 cells.
Additionally, p53 knockout at least partially attenuate the
inhibition of colony formation by Chel A (Figs. 2D & 2E).
These results indicated that p53 participated in Chel A’s
effect on apoptotic induction and further on inhibition of
cancer cell anchorage-independent growth.

p53, as a tumor suppressor, has been reported to
be involved in caspase-dependent apoptosis [8]. Hence,
to further explore the mechanism of Chel A’s anti-cancer
effect, we performed Western blot to check whether
p53 participated in the Chel A-induced cell apoptosis.
Phosphorylated status of p53 at Ser20 and Ser15, which
are positively associated with protein stabilization
and apoptotic induction [9, 10], and total p53 protein
expression, were examined in Chel A-treated HCT116
cells. The data showed that the phosphorylation of p53
at Ser20 was significantly upregulated following 1 hr and
thereafter exposure, whereas the phosphorylation of p53
at Ser15 was almost slightly increased at early (≤3 hrs)
time upon treatment and increased significantly at 6 hrs of
the treatment. The total p53 expression exhibited a steady
increasing trend in response to Chel A treatment, reaching
maximum at 2-6 hours (Fig. 2A). Since phosphorylation

Chel A inhibited p53 protein degradation

Chel A and CHX is much higher than those observed in
the cells treated with CHX alone, suggesting that Chel
A treatment accumulate p53 via inhibiting p53 protein
degradation.

To delineate the molecular mechanism responsible
for p53 protein upregulation by Chel A, we first examined
the effect of Chel A on p53 mRNA level in HCT116 cells.
The results from RT-PCR revealed that Chel A exerted no
impact on p53 mRNA level within 6 hrs along the time
course (Fig. 3A). Hence, p53 protein induction by Chel A
might be regulated at the protein level.
To clarify whether Chel A could prevent p53 protein
from degradation, proteasome inhibitor MG132 was
employed to pretreat HCT116 cells. MG132 was then
removed and the synthetic inhibitor cycloheximide(CHX)
was added to the cells alone or in combination with Chel
A for various time periods. Such an experimental system
could afford insight into effect of Chel A on the dynamic
of p53 protein degradation. As shown in Fig. 3B, p53
protein level at 4 hrs and 6 hrs in cells co-treated with

Chk2 participated in p53 induction during Chel
A treatment
Several proteins, such as MDM2, Chk1/2, and
ATR are capable of regulating p53 at the protein level
[10, 12]. MDM2, as p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, can
promote p53 protein degradation [12]. Posttranslational
phosphorylation of the MDM2 protein at Ser166 has been
reported to contribute to p53 protein degradation [13].
Thus, MDM2 phosphorylation at Ser166 was examined
in Chel A-treated HCT116 cells. The data demonstrated
that total MDM2 protein expression was not affected by
Chel A, whereas phosphorylation at Ser166 was slightly

HCT116 cells were pretreated with 2’,7’-dichlorfluorescein-diacetate (DCFH) (A) ordihydroethidium (HE) (B), respectively, for 0.5 hr,
followed by being treated with Chel A for indicated time periods. Then cells were washed with PBS, and subjected to fluorescence intensity
detection. The results were shown as the induction of each time point relative to 0 h(Relative fluorescence intensity). The symbol (*) indicates
a signiﬁcant increase as compared with that at 0 h (P <0.05). Each bar indicates the mean±SD from three independent experiments. (C&D)

of Chel A in soft agar. After being cultured in 37oC with 5% CO2 for 3 weeks, the colony formation was observed under inverted microscope

HCT116 mCat and HCT116 (vector) cells, respectively (F). The symbol (*) indicates a signiﬁcant increase in HCT116 mCat cells treated

upregulated at 6 hrs following Chel A treatment (Fig. 3C).
These results indicated that Chel A exerted no inhibitory
effect on MDM2 phosphorylation at Ser166, thereby
not accounting for accumulation of p53 protein in Chel
A-treated HCT116 cells.
In addition to MDM2, Chk1 and Chk2 are likewise
the potential mediators that stabilize and activate p53
via inducing phosphorylation of p53 protein [14]. Given
that the phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser345 or of Chk2
at Thr68 is required for their activation [15, 16], we thus
examined the phosphorylated status at these two sites
of Chk1 and Chk2, respectively, upon Chel A treatment.
Western blot analysis showed that phosphorylation of
Chk2 at Thr68 was induced as early as 2 hrs and reaching
the peak at 6 hrs following Chel A treatment, whereas an
elevated phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser345 was only
slightly increased at 6 hrs of Chel A treatment (Fig. 3C).
Due to the fact that phosphorylation of p53 was induced at
an early stage (approximately 2 hrs), Chk1 was excluded
from directly participation in p53 induction, whereas Chk2
might play a role in p53 stabilization and transactivation.

at Ser 20 and Ser15, which in turn increased p53 protein
stabilization, and further led to apoptosis following Chel
A treatment.

ATR deletion crippled Chk2-mediated p53
protein phosphorylation, apoptosis, and inhibition
of anchorage-independent growth by Chel A in
HCT116 cells
In addition to Chk1 and Chk2, ATR is a P-I3 kinaserelated kinase (PIKK) family member capable of activating
p53 directly or indirectly via inducing posttranslational
phosphorylation of p53 protein at Ser15 in response to
some stimuli [16]. Previously report also demonstrates
that ATR activation is associated with its phosporylation
at Ser428 [16]. Thus, in an effort to evaluate the role of
ATR in p53 expression, phosphorylated ATR at Ser428
was examined in Chel A-treated HCT116 cells. Western
blot analysis revealed that ATR phosphorylation at Ser428
was induced as early as 1 hr and reached maximal at 3
hrs following Chel A treatment with gradually increased
ATR protein expression (Fig. 3C). The results from RTPCR indicated that ATR mRNA was not induced by Chel
A treatment (Fig. 3D), suggesting that Chel A-induced
ATR protein expression was regulated at either protein
translation and/or protein degradation, rather than protein
transcription and mRNA stability. Collectively, our results
demonstrated that ATR was activated by Chel A, and
further revealing potential contribution of ATR to p53
protein induction and function.
To understand the role of ATR in p53 protein
induction by Chel A, HCT116 cells with conditional
knockout of ATR were used. As shown in Fig. 5A, ATR
was verified to be conditional depleted in HCT116 cells.
Notably, Chel A-induced phosphorylation of Chk2 at
Thr68 and of p53 at Ser20 and Ser15, as well as p53
protein induction were impaired in HCT116 ATR flox/cells in comparison to these in parental HCT116 cells. In
contrast, the deletion of Chk2 did not show observable
reduction of either ATR phosphorylattion at Ser428 or
ATR protein expression following Chel A treatment (Fig.
4A).These data strongly suggested that ATR served as an
upstream factor regulating Chk2 activation and played a
key role in mediating Chel A-induced Chk2 activation
and p53 protein stabilization. Moreover, ATR conditional
knockout also abolished apoptosis (Fig. 5C), cleavages
of caspase-3 and PARP (Fig. 5B) induced by Chel A
treatment, as well as Chel A inhibition of anchorageindependent growth (Figs. 5D&5E) in HCT116 cells.
Collectively, our results indicated that upon Chel A
treatment, ATR activated Chk2, and in turn mediated p53
phsphorylation and stabilization, subsequently resulting
cancer cell apoptosis and inhibition of anchorageindependent growth of cancer cells.

Chk2 knockout attenuated p53 activation, cell
apoptosis, and the inhibition of colony formation
by Chel A in HCT116 cells
To substantiate the role of Chk2 in p53 activation,
we used HCT116 Chk2-/- cells to analyze protein levels
of p53 protein phosphorylation and expression following
Chel A treatment. As shown in Fig. 4A, phosphorylated
Chk2 protein was depleted in HCT116 Chk2-/- cells
compared to that in Chk2+/+ cells. Importantly, Chel
A-induced p53 protein expression was blocked in
Chk2-/- cells, and the phosphorylation of p53 at Ser20
and Ser15 were almost abrogated by Chk2 knockout.
Since phosphorylation at ser20 normally contributes to
the stabilization of p53 protein [8], which in turn can
induce the phosphorylation at ser15 [10], we anticipated
that Chk2 mediated Chel A-induced p53 stabilization and
protein accumulation by regulating p53 phosphorylation at
Ser15 and Ser20. In an effort to further elucidate whether
Chk2-mediated p53 accumulation was resulted from
the prevention of p53 protein degradation, we utilized
HCT116 Chk2-/- cells and aforementioned proteasome
inhibitor MG132 and protein synthesis inhibitor CHX.
The results showed that Chel A-inhibition of p53 protein
degradation in HCT116 Chk2+/+ cells was not observable
in HCT116 Chk2-/- cells under same experimental
conditions (Fig. 4B), further revealing that Chk2 mediated
Chel A-induced p53 protein expression via increasing its
stability. Consistently, Chk2-deletion abrogated apoptosis
(Fig. 4C), cleavages of caspase-3 and PARP (Fig. 4D), as
well as inhibition of anchorage-independent growth (Figs.
4E&4F) in HCT116 cells. These results strongly indicated
that Chk2 expression was crucial for p53 phosphorylation

Hydrogen peroxide generation by Chel A
initiated ATR/Chk2 activation, p53 protein
induction, apoptosis and inhibition of anchorageindependent growth

formation in HCT116 cell lines. Further mechanistic
study manifested that Chel A-elicited apoptosis was via
hydrogen peroxide/ATR/Chk2/p53 pathway, which is
distinctive from the mechanisms responsible for Chel A
cancer chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive effect in
HL-60 cells and JB6 Cl41 cells, respectively. This finding
indicated that Chel A could also potentially serve as
intervention for colon cancer therapy.
The p53 tumor suppressor pathway is dysfunctional
in most colorectal cancers [3], and thus employing
rational attempts reversing p53 downregulation in cancer
cells by impairing p53 degradation would be a tempting
strategy for colon cancer therapy. Intriguingly, we found
that Chel A-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells was
mediated by accumulation of p53 protein expression.
Particularly, Chel A treatment could promote the
stabilization and accumulation of p53 protein by inducing
its phosphorylation at Ser20, which in turn contributes to
p53 protein induction by increasing its phosphorylation at
Ser15. Moreover, our results strongly indicate that Chel A
treatment regulates p53 by preventing p53 proteins from
degradation.
Regulation of p53 protein degradation may result
from several factors, typically including MDM2, Chk1/2,
and ATR [10, 12]. Amongst these factors, the results from
our studies clearly indicated that MDM2 and Chk1 were
denied as direct regulators involved in p53 upregulation by
Chel A in HCT116 cells, whereas the activation of Chk2
and ATR at a relatively early stage revealed their potential
participation in p53 protein induction by Chel A treatment.
In light of the abrogation of p53 stabilization, as well as
the non-disruptive ATR activation in Chk2 knockout
cells, Chk2 is very likely to function as a mediator being
responsible for p53 accumulation. Moreover, based on
well-documented previous studies [10], phosphorylation
of p53 at Ser20 may be also induced by Chk2 in our
experimental system. Considering that ATR conditional
knockout crippled the induction of both phosphorylated
p53 and Chk2, we conclude that ATR is not only
substantiated to be a key factor for in Chel A-induced
p53 protein expression, but also suggest that ATR acts
as a Chk2 upstream regulator. This result, together with
previous literature [10, 19, 20], suggested that ATR is
possible to make binary decisions to mediate p53 protein
accumulation following Chel A treatment——that is,
either phosphorylating p53 at Ser15 directly or activating
Chk2 via the phosphorylation at Thr68, both of which
would next lead to p53 protein accumulation. Taken all
evidence together, our results indicate that Chel A-induced
p53 protein expression in HCT116 cells could be via the
bifurcating signaling cascades, i.e. ATR/p53 signaling and
ATR/Chk2/p53 axis.
ROS as products of cellular metabolism could
potentially result in DNA damage and likewise play
an important role in apoptosis induction [18, 21-23].
A host of stimulations have been identified hitherto to

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been
extensively documented to induce DNA damage, which
can activate kinases including ATR and Chk2 [17, 18].
Hence, 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA)
and hydroethidine (HE) were employed to determine
the generation of intracellular hydrogen peroxide and
superoxide anion following HCT116 treated with Chel
A. As illustrated in Figs. 6A& 6B, the generation of
hydrogen peroxide was significantly increased and
reached maximual at 1 hr following Chel A treatment,
whereas the increasing tendency of superoxide level was
not pronounced under the same experimental conditions.
To further assess whether generation of hydrogen peroxide
promote the ATR/Chk2 activation and p53 protein
induction in response to Chel A stimulation, HCT116 cells
were stably transfected with mitochondria catalase (mCat)
and ectopic expression of mCat in HCT116 mCat cells
was identified as shown in Fig. 6C. mCat overexpression
attenuated the phosphorylation of ATR at Ser428, Chk2
phosphorylation at Thr68, and p53 phosphorylation
at Ser20 and Ser15, as well as p53 protein induction in
comparison to these in parental HCT116 (vector) cells,
suggesting that elevated intracellular level of hydrogen
peroxide was required for the activation of ATR/Chk2,
and p53 protein induction by Chel A. Importantly, the
inhibitory effect of Chel A on anchorage-independent
growth of HCT116 cells was also blocked by mCat ectopic
expression. These results demonstrated that hydrogen
peroxide generation by Chel A treatment initiated
phosphorylation and activation of ATR/Chk2 cascade,
further leading to p53 phosphorylation and protein
accumulation, and subsequently resulting in apoptosis
and inhibition of anchorage-independent growth of cancer
cells.

DISCUSSION
The styryl-lactone Chel A has been shown to
trigger apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia
HL-60 cells by downregulating Bcl-2 expression,
thereby exhibiting the potential as a chemotherapeutic
agent in treating human leukemia cells [4, 5]. Our most
recently study also demonstrates the chemopreventive
effect of Chel A by investigating its inhibition of EGFinduced mouse epidermal Cl41 cell transformation
with apoptotic induction [6]. However, the therapy
potential and its mechanism of Chel A in colon cancer
have not been identified yet. In the present study, we
have unveiled another biological function of Chel A
that inducing apoptosis and inhibition of cell colony

augment the intracellular ROS level, thereby triggering
apoptosis [24-26]. Herein, we found that Chel A treatment
could lead to hydrogen peroxide generation, which was
central to Chel A-induced activation of ATR, Chk2, and
induction of p53 protein, as induction of ROS generation
upon Chel A treatment and the findings that ATR/Chk2
activation and p53 protein expression by Chel A were
almost completely impaired by ectopic expression of
mCat in HCT116 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of cancer
cell anchorage-independent growth was also reversed by
mCat overexpression. Collectively, hydrogen peroxide
generation in response to Chel A treatment was suggested
to be responsible for occuring a series of aforementioned
signaling events, cell apoptosis and inhibition of cancer
cell anchorage-independent growth. Nevertheless, the
detailed molecular mechanism responsible for hydrogen
peroxide generation by Chel A remains mysterious, and
hence is currently underway in our laboratory.
In summary, our studies demonstrate a
chemotherapeutic function of Chel A by triggering
apoptosis in HCT116 cells. Further studies on apoptosis
induction implicated that hydrogen peroxide generation
following Chel A treatment mediates ATR phosphorylation
and activation. The activated ATR possessed its p53
protein accumulation through both ATR/p53 cascade or
ATR/Chk2/p53 axis, which in turn exclusively lead to
apoptosis (Fig. 6G). Thus, the natural compound Chel A
would be exploited as a potential chemotherapeutic agent
for cancer therapy.

ATR flox/- cells cells were kindly provided by Dr. Jian
Wang, West Virginia University [22][32]. The HCT116
cells and their stable transfectant lines were maintained
at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator in McCoy’s 5A medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2
mM L-glutamine, and 25 µg/ml gentamicin. The cultures
were dissociated with trypsin and transferred to new 25
cm2 culture flasks twice a week. FBS was purchased from
Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and the
other cell culture reagents were obtained from Sigma (St.
Louis, MO, USA).

Plasmids and transfection.
Mitochondria Catalase expression plasmid (pZeo/
mCat) and its parental control vector were kindly provided
by Dr. J. Andres Melendez (Center for Immunology and
Microbial Disease, Albany Medical College) as described
before [31, 32]. HCT116 cells were transfected with
mCat and its corresponding control vector by using
PolyJetTM DNA In Vitro Transfection Reagent (SignaGen
Laboratories, Rockville, MD, USA) following the
manufacturer’s instructions and stable transfectants were
selected by Zeocin-resistant selection.

Cell proliferation analysis.
HCT116 cells were trypsinized and 2×103 viable
cells suspended in 100 µl medium containing 10% FBS
were seeded into each well of 96-well plates to 80%
confluence. After exposure to Chel A, cells were lysed
with 50 µl lysis buffer. The proliferation of the cells
was measured using Cell Titer-Glo® Luminescent Cell
Viability Assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with a
luminometer (Wallac 1420 Victor 2 multilabel counter
system). The results were expressed as luminescence
activity relative to medium alone (proliferation index)[30,
33].

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Chemicals.
Chel A [6(7,8-epoxy-styryl)-5-acetoxy-5,6-dihydro2-pyrone] was isolated from Goniothalamus cheliensis by
the Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Kunming, China ref. [4]. Dichloroﬂuorescein
diacetate (DCFH-DA) and hydroethidine (HE) were
from purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Chemicals MG132 and cycloheximide (CHX)
were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA,
USA). Dichloroﬂuorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and
hydroethidine (HE) were from purchased from Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, CA, USA).

Anchorage-independent cancer cell growth.
Soft agar colony formation assay was performed
as previously described [30, 34, 35]. In brief, 2.5 ml of
0.5% agar in basal modified Eagle’s medium (BMEM)
supplemented with 10% FBS, and 20 ng/ml EGF, as
well as Chel A, at indicated concentrations, was layered
onto each well of 6-well tissue culture plates. 3×104
HCT116 cells, their knockout derivatives, or their stable
transfectants were mixed with 1 ml of 0.5% agar BMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, as well as with or without
Chel A, and layered on top of the 0.5% agar layer. The
plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for three weeks.
The colonies were then counted under microscopy. Those
with more than 32 cells were scored. The results were

Cell culture.
The human colon cancer cell line HCT116 and its
p53-deficient (HCT116 p53-/-) derivative were kindly

Western blottings.

HCT116 cells were cultured in 6-well plates until
70%–80% conﬂuent. Cell culture medium was replaced
with 0.1% FBS medium for 24 hrs. The cells were then
treated with Chel A at indicated concentrations. After 48
hrs treatment, cells were washed, and ﬁxed in ice-cold
70% ethanol and stained with PI buffer (0.1% Triton
X-100, 0.2 mg/ml RNase A, and 0.05 mg/ml PI) for
15 min. The samples were subjected to ﬂow cytometry
(Beckman) for apoptosis analysis as described in our
previously[36, 40].

HCT116 cells and their knockout derivatives or
transfectants were cultured in each well of 6-well plates
with normal medium until they reached 70%-80%
confluence. Cell culture medium was replaced to medium
with 0.1% FBS for 24 hours. Then the cells were treated
with Chel A with indicated concentrations and time
periods. following by being washed with ice-cold PBS,
and then extracted with cell lysis buffer (10 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, 1mM Na3VO4, and proteasome
inhibitor).The cell extracts were subjected to Western
blotting with each of the antibodies for determination of
PARP, Cleaved PARP, Caspase 3, Cleaved Caspase 3,
p53, p-p53 Ser20, p-p53 Ser15, p-MDM2 Ser166, Chk2,
p-Chk2 Thr68, p-Chk1 Ser345, ATR, p-ATR Ser428(Cell
Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), Catalase (Calbiochem,
EMD Biosciences, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA), MDM2,
β-Actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), as indicated.
The protein bands specifically bound to the primary
antibodies were detected using an alkaline phosphataselinked secondary antibody and an ECF (enhanced
chemifluorescence) Western blotting analysis system
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA), as
previously described [34, 36, 37].

ROS detection by ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer
analysis.
HCT116 cells were seeded into 96-well plates until
75-80% confluent. The cell culture medium was replaced
with 0.1% FBS McCoy’s 5A medium for 24 hrs. The
cells were incubated with DCFH-DA or HE for 0.5 hr,
and were then exposed to Chel A at indicated time periods
followed by washing with PBS to remove the extracellular
compounds and the fluorescence Intensities were detected
by using SpectroMax M2 Microplate Reader (Molecular
Devices Corp.). The cells incubated with DCFH-DA were
employed to monitor the production of hydrogen peroxide,
with the excitation of 488 nm and emission of 530 nm,
while cells treated with HE were used to the measure of
superoxide, with excitation of 510 nm and emission of 600
nm [32, 41, 42].

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR).

Statistical analysis.

HCT116 cells were cultured in 6-well plates until
reaching 70%-80% confluence. Cell culture medium was
changed to 0.1% FBS medium for 24 hrs. Then cells were
exposed to Chel A using the same method as was used
for the cells treated for Western blotting assay. After
treatment for the indicated time periods, total RNAs were
extracted from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, California, USA). Total cDNAs were
synthesized by using oligdT(20) primer by SuperScriptTM
First-Strand Synthesis system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
California, USA). ATR, p53 and β-actin mRNA presented
in the cells were determined by semiquantative RT-PCR
assay. Human ATR (Forward: 5’-gcgtgcctgccagaatggga-3’,
Reverse
5’-cgatcggagcggccagcttt-3’),
p53
(Forward:
5’-gaacccttgcttgcaatagg-3’,
Reverse

and
β-actin
(Forward: 5’-gcgagaagatgacccagatcat-3’, Reverse:
5’-gctcaggaggagcaatgatctt-3’) primers (Invitrogen)
were used to determine the mRNA levels of ATR,
p53 and β-actin, respectively [36]. The PCR products
were separated onto 3% agarose gels, stained with EB,
and scanned the images from a UV light as described
previously [36, 38, 39].

The student’s t-test was used to determine the
signiﬁcance between Chel A-treated vs. untreated group,
or between specific gene knockout group vs. wild type
group, or between specific gene transfectant vs. vector
transfectant. The results are expressed as mean ± SD
from at least three independent experiments. P<0.05 was
considered as a significant difference between comparison
groups.
