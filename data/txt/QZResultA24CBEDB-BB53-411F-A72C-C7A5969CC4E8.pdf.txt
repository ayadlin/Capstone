SUMMARY
BMK1 is activated by mitogens and oncogenic signals and, thus, is strongly implicated in
tumorigenesis. We found that BMK1 interacted with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), and
inhibited its tumor-suppressor function through phosphorylation. Furthermore, activated BMK1
notably inhibited PML-dependent activation of p21. To further investigate the BMK-mediated
inhibition of the tumor suppressor activity of PML in tumor cells, we developed a small-molecule
inhibitor of the kinase activity of BMK1, XMD8-92. Inhibition of BMK1 by XMD8-92 blocked
tumor cell proliferation in vitro and significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo by 95%,
demonstrating the efficacy and tolerability of BMK1-targeted cancer treatment in animals.

INTRODUCTION
Four MAP kinase pathways exist in mammalian cells: ERK1/2, JNK, p38 and BMK1
(Chang and Karin, 2001; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002; Pearson et al., 2001; Raman et al.,
2007). BMK1 is most similar to ERK1/2 since both contain the Thr-Glu-Tyr dual
phosphorylation motif. However, unlike ERK1/2, BMK1 has a unique activating loop
structure and an uncommonly large C-terminal non-kinase domain. The C-terminal half of
BMK1 contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) which is critical for nuclear localization
of BMK1 (Lee et al., 1995). The ERK1/2 and BMK1 cascades are both activated by

mitogens and by oncogenic signals and, thus, are strongly implicated in tumorigenesis
(Chang and Karin, 2001; Johnson and Lapadat, 2002; Kato et al., 1997; Kato et al., 1998;
Pearson et al., 2001). Specifically, deregulated BMK1 signaling has been associated with
properties of human malignancies including chemoresistance of breast tumor cells (Weldon
et al., 2002), uncontrolled proliferation of ErbB2-overexpressing carcinomas (EsparisOgando et al., 2002), metastatic potential of prostate tumor cells (Mehta et al., 2003), and
tumor-associated angiogenesis (Hayashi et al., 2005).
Three sequentially activated kinases make up the central core of the MAP kinase module: a
MAP kinase kinase kinase, or MEKK; a MAP kinase kinase, or MEK; and a MAP kinase.
The signaling core in the BMK1 pathway consists of the kinases, MEKK2/MEKK3, MEK5
and BMK1 (Hayashi and Lee, 2004). MEK5 is the only known direct upstream regulatory
kinase of BMK1 (Kato et al., 1997). However, MEK5 can be inhibited by inhibitors of
MEK1/2 (Kamakura et al., 1999; Mody et al., 2001), such as PD98059 and U0126, which
have been considered as specific inhibitors of the ERK1/2 pathway. As such, experimental
results produced using these two inhibitors need to be re-evaluated using more specific
inhibitors of the BMK1 and the ERK1/2 cascades. So far, there is no specific smallmolecule inhibitor of BMK1 that is effective both in cells and animals. More importantly,
the lack of this kind of BMK1 inhibitor has hampered the understanding of the
physiological/pathological roles of BMK1 through cellular and animal studies.

RESULTS
Development of Pharmacological Inhibitors of BMK1

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

During the course of developing isoform-selective polo kinase inhibitors, we synthesized a
library of analogs of the highly selective, ATP-competitive polo kinase inhibitor, BI-2536
(Steegmaier et al., 2007). By screening a subset of the library against a diverse panel of 402
kinases, we were able to explore the full range of potential kinase targets of this class of
compounds (Goldstein et al., 2008). We discovered that expansion of the 6-membered
aliphatic ring of BI-2536 to a 7-membered ring containing an anthranilic acid resulted in
loss of polo kinase inhibition activity but serendipitously resulted in compounds that
exhibited high selectivity towards BMK1. Structure-activity guided optimization based on
the ability of the compounds to inhibit cellular BMK1 autophosphorylation stimulated by
EGF (Kato et al., 1998) in conjunction with kinase selectivity analysis resulted in the
synthesis of XMD8-92 (Figure 1A). The kinase selectivity of XMD8-92 was determined by
profiling the inhibitor at a concentration of 10 μM against a panel of 402 diverse kinases
using an in vitro ATP-site competition binding assay (Fabian et al., 2005; Karaman et al.,
2008). Kinases that exhibited greater than 90% displacement by XMD8-92 were determined
to be BMK1, DCAMKL1, DCAMKL2, TNK1 and PLK4. XMD8-92 exhibited the greatest
affinity towards BMK1 with a measured dissociation constant (Kd) of 80 nM, while
DCAMKL2, TNK1 and PLK4 exhibited Kd’s of 190, 890 and 600 nM, respectively (Table
S1). This represents a remarkable level of selectivity considering the very large number of
kinases that have been assayed. Moreover, XMD8-92 was profiled against all detectable
kinases in HeLa cell lysates using the KiNativ method (Patricelli et al., 2007) and was found
to be about 10-fold more selective for BMK1 with a IC50 of 1.5 μM than the most potent
off-targets, TNK1 (IC50 = 10 μM) and ACK1 (aka TNK2, IC50 = 18 μM). Other weak offtargets included the kinase domain 2 of RSK1 and RSK2, PIK4A and PIK4B, and FAK
(Table S2). Notably, MEK5 was not significantly inhibited by XMD8-92 at up to 50 μM.
There is also no significant inhibitory effect of XMD8-92 on TNK1 and PLK4 detected in
vitro and in vivo (Figure S1). The BMK1 potency and selectivity determined by the KiNativ
method support the conclusion that the anti-cancer effects of XMD8-92 detailed herein are
due to inhibition of BMK1.

We tested the effect of XMD8-92 on the cellular activity of BMK1. Growth factor-induced
activation of cellular BMK1, but not the structurally similar ERK1/2, was effectively
blocked by 1 μM XMD8-92 (Figure 1B), while PD184352, an ERK1/2 inhibitor, only
blocked ERK1/2 but not BMK1 activation by EGF (Figure 1B). XMD8-92 also significantly
reduced BMK1 activity in in vitro kinase assays (Figure 1C). In addition, Trans-reporter
assays showed that XMD8-92 dramatically reduced the BMK1-dependent transactivating
activity of MEF2C, a known substrate for BMK1 (Kato et al., 1997) (Figure 1D).
As the BMK1 pathway is critical for cell proliferation (Kato et al., 1998), we next tested
whether XMD8-92, through its specific ability to block BMK1 activity, has an antiproliferative effect on cells. The extent of inhibition by XMD8-92 in HeLa cells is
indistinguishable from that by dominant negative BMK1, BMK1(Ala-Glu-Phe [AEF]),
administered through infection with recombinant adenovirus encoding BMK1(AEF), AdBMK1(AEF) (Figure 1E). The inhibitory effect of XMD8-92 on proliferation was observed
in a wide variety of cancer cell lines (Figure S2). Moreover, additional treatment of AdBMK1(AEF)-infected HeLa cells with XMD8-92 did not have a further inhibitory effect
when compared to cancer cells treated with XMD8-92 alone (Figure 1E), indicating that at
least some of the anti-proliferative capacity of XMD8-92 is through inhibition of the activity
of BMK1.

Subsequently, to assess the utility of XMD8-92 in animal experiments, we analyzed the
pharmacokinetics and tolerability of XMD8-92. The pharmacokinetics of XMD8-92 was
evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats given a single intravenous or oral dose. XMD8-92 was
found to have a 2.0 hr half life clearance of 26 mL/min/kg. The compound had moderate
tissue distribution with a calculated volume of distribution of 3.4 L/kg. XMD8-92 had high
oral bioavailability with 69% of the dose absorbed. After a single oral dose of 2 mg/kg,
maximal plasma concentrations of approximately 500 nM were observed by 30 minutes,
with 34 nM remaining 8 hr post dose. (Figure S1). In tolerability experiments (Table S3, S4
and S5), high plasma concentrations of drug (approximately 10 μM following IP dosing of
50 mg/kg) were maintained throughout the 14 days. The drug appeared to be well tolerated
and the mice appeared healthy with no sign of distress. No vasculature instability was
observed in the XMD8-92-treated mice (Table S4, S5 and Figure 1F). Together, these
results demonstrated that XMD8-92 is an effective and specific inhibitor of BMK1 in vitro
and in vivo.
BMK1 Is in Complex with PML and Suppresses Its Anti-Cancer Activity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To study the molecular mechanism by which BMK1 regulates cell proliferation, we
performed mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of cellular BMK1-interacting proteins and
revealed that BMK1 interacted with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) (Table S6).
Western blot analysis using two different anti-PML antibodies showed that PML coprecipitated with BMK1 (Figure 2A) and that reciprocal immunoprecipitation of PML using
anti-PML antibody brought down cellular BMK1 (Figure 2B). These data indicate that
endogenous BMK1 is in complex with PML.
As PML is a tumor suppressor and known to regulate cell proliferation, we next tested
whether BMK1 controls the anti-tumor function of PML. We found that p21, one of the
downstream effectors of PML and a key modulator of cell proliferation (Bernardi and
Pandolfi, 2007; Salomoni and Pandolfi, 2002), was significantly induced when the
expression level of BMK1 was suppressed by siRNA (Figure 2C). Inhibition of BMK1
activation by XMD8-92 also significantly induced p21 expression in cells (Figure 2D), and
its induction was substantially reduced in PML null cells (Figure 2D). Using PMLknockdown cell lines, we also demonstrated that PML and p21 are involved in XMD8-92mediated suppression of cancer cell proliferation (Figure S2). These results indicated that

BMK1 not only is in complex with PML but also suppresses the expression of the cell-cycle
regulator p21, through inhibiting the anti-tumor function of PML.

BMK1 Suppress PML Function through Phosphorylation
Since BMK1 is known to regulate the activity of cellular proteins through phosphorylation
(Hayashi et al., 2001; Kato et al., 1997; Kato et al., 2000), we performed an in vitro kinase
assay using activated BMK1 kinase and recombinant PML as substrate, followed by mass
spectrometry analysis (details in Experimental Procedures) to map the potential
phosphorylation sites on PML by BMK1. We identified that S403 and T409 of PML as
potential phosphorylation sites (Figure 3A). Mutation of these two sites to Alanine
significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of PML by BMK1 in an in vitro kinase assay
(Figure 3B) indicating these two sites in PML are major phosphorylation sites by the BMK1
kinase. PML phosphorylation by BMK1 in vivo was also demonstrated (Figure S3). We next
mutated S403 and T409 to Aspartic acid (PML-2D) to mimic the phosphorylation of PML
by BMK1. We found that recombinant adenovirus-mediated expression of PML2D (S403D/
T409D) in PML-deficient cells did not significantly restore their responsiveness to
XMD8-92-dependent p21 induction unlike wild type PML, which did restore responsiveness
(Figure 3C). As PML is known to modulate p21 through p53 (Guo et al., 2000), the role of
BMK1 on p53 regulation is still not clear (Figure S4). These results indicate that BMK1
suppresses PML function through phosphorylation of S403 and T409 of PML (Figure 3C).

Activated BMK1 Translocates from the Cytosol to Colocalize with PML in the Nucleus

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It has been shown that, upon activation, BMK1 translocates from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus (Kondoh et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2001). As PML is known to localize to the PMLnuclear body (PML-NB), through which it mediates diverse cellular functions, we wondered
whether BMK1, after activation, could move to the nucleus and colocalize with PML in
PML-NBs. We expressed a dominant negative form of MEK5, MEK5A (Kato et al., 1997),
to inhibit the activation of BMK1 in cells (Figure 4A, first-row panels). Conversely, we
expressed a dominant active form of MEK5, MEK5D, to keep BMK1 activated in cells
(Figure 4A, second-row panels). With increased expression of PML in cells, activated
BMK1 is colocalized with PML in the PML-NBs (Figure 4A, fourth-row panels) while nonactivated BMK1 stays in the cytoplasm (Figure 4A, third-row panels). BMK1 contains a
kinase domain in its N-terminal half and a non-kinase domain in its C-terminal half (Figure
4B). We next tested the involvement of these two domains in the colocalization of activated
BMK1 and PML in PML-NBs. We demonstrate that the kinase region, but not the nonkinase region, of BMK1 is sufficient for the colocalization of BMK1 and PML in PML-NBs
(Figure 4B). This result indicates that BMK1, upon activation, translocates from the cytosol
to the nucleus and, through its kinase domain, colocalizes with PML in PML-NBs (Figure
5).
BMK1 Is a Potential Drug Target for Treating Cancer
To evaluate the effectiveness of XMD8-92 in inhibiting the activity of BMK1 in tumors, we
tested the compound in mice xenografted with human tumors. XMD8-92 was found to
effectively inhibit BMK1 activation as well as induce PML’s downstream effector, p21
(Figure 6A). More importantly, treatment of the mice with XMD8-92 one day, several days,
or weeks after inoculation of the tumor cells all significantly inhibit the growth of the
xenografted human or syngeneic mouse tumors (Figure 6B), without obvious side effects to
the animals. Immuno-staining of tumor sections showed that XMD8-92 effectively inhibited
the incorporation of BrdU during tumor cell division (Figure 6C) indicating XMD8-92
blocks tumor cell proliferation, one of the anti-cancer effects of PML. As both BMK1 and
PML are involved in angiogenesis (Bernardi et al., 2006; Borden and Culjkovic, 2009;
Hayashi et al., 2005; Hayashi et al., 2004), we tested whether XMD8-92 blocks

angiogenesis in vivo and found that XMD8-92 significantly inhibits basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF) induced angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs (Figure 6D). These results indicated
that XMD8-92 exerts its anti-tumor effect by blocking tumor cell proliferation and tumorassociated angiogenesis, and, possibly, through other BMK1-dependent mechanisms yet to
be tested or discovered.
We further examined whether the anti-tumor effect of XMD8-92 is specific to its antiBMK1 capacity. The extent of tumor growth inhibition by XMD8-92 is identical to that
elicited using dominant negative BMK1 administered through intratumoral injection of AdBMK1(AEF) (Figure 7A). Importantly, the additional treatment of Ad-BMK1(AEF) did not
have a further inhibitory effect on the tumor-bearing mice treated with XMD8-92 alone
(Figure 7A) indicating the anti-tumor capacity of XMD8-92 is, at least partly, through
blocking the activity of BMK1.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next evaluate the role of PML in XMD8-92-dependent inhibition of tumor growth. We
found that depleting PML in tumor cells significantly lowered, but did not completely
abrogate, the inhibitory effect of XMD8-92 on their growth in mice (Figure 7B). As
XMD8-92 inhibits tumor cell proliferation and neovascularization (Figure 6C and 6D), the
reason why PML depletion in tumor cells can only partly reverse the anti-tumor effect of
XMD8-92 may be that PML in tumor cells is responsible only for mediating XMD8-92mediated growth arrest of cancer cells and not for XMD8-92-dependent angiogenesis
inhibition. Moreover, increasing the expression level of wild type PML in these PMLknockdown (KD) tumor cells restored their sensitivity to XMD8-92-mediated inhibition of
tumor growth (Figure 7B). In contrast, expression of PML2D in the PML-KD cells did not
re-establish their responsiveness to XMD8-92-mediated suppression of tumor proliferation
(Figure 7B). These data indicate that PML plays a role in XMD8-92-mediated suppression
of tumor growth.
Taken together, these results demonstrated that the BMK1 pathway in animals can be
blocked effectively by a small-molecule inhibitor without apparent adverse effects and,
more importantly, BMK1 inhibition is a very effective way to prevent cancer development
in animals.

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The promyelocytic leukemia protein PML (also called MYL, RNF71, PP8675 or TRIM19)
has been implicated in the regulation of a range of cellular functions, such as inhibition of
proliferation, induction of cellular senescence and apoptosis, as well as maintenance of
genomic stability (Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007). It is well known that compromising PML
anti-cancer function by gene translocation (to produce the PML-RAR fusion protein) leads
to acute promyelocytic leukemia. PML-RAR fusion protein not only represses PML
function but also represses transcriptional activity mediated by RAR-RXR, thereby
disrupting retinoid signaling (Altucci and Gronemeyer, 2001). Although the physiological
roles of PML are not yet fully understood, the tumor-suppressive function of PML is
generally recognized (Bernardi et al., 2006; Salomoni and Pandolfi, 2002; Trotman et al.,
2006). One of the critical anti-cancer/anti-proliferative functions of PML is through
activation of the tumor suppressor, p21, through transcriptional regulation of p53 (Bernardi
and Pandolfi, 2007; Bernardi et al., 2004; Fogal et al., 2000; Guo et al., 2000; Pearson et al.,
2000; Pearson and Pelicci, 2001). Previous reports have described the regulation of PML
through phosphorylation by kinases such as ERK1/2 and CK2 (Hayakawa and Privalsky,
2004; Scaglioni et al., 2006). Herein, we report that the mitogenic MAP kinase, BMK1,
interacts with PML and suppresses its anti-tumor actions such as p21 activation. However,
the effect of BMK1 on p53 regulation is not clear (Figure S4) and needs further

investigation. Since BMK1 negatively regulates PML tumor suppressor function and BMK1
is activated by a variety of deregulated oncogenes (e.g., Her2, Ras and STAT3), it is likely
that the oncogene-induced BMK1 activation increases the proliferation/survival/chemoresistance potential of tumor cells by dampening the anti-cancer capacity of PML.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

BMK1 promotes tumor development not only by inhibiting the PML tumor suppressor
described herein but also by supporting tumor angiogenesis (Hayashi et al., 2005; Hayashi
and Lee, 2004; Pi et al., 2005), tumor metastasis (Sawhney et al., 2009; Sticht et al., 2008;
Zhou et al., 2008) and chemo-resistance of tumor cells (Weldon et al., 2002). In addition, no
significant feed-back compensatory activation of any other signaling pathway was detected,
so far, by blocking the BMK1 pathway using XMD8-92 (Figure S4). Conditional knockout
of BMK1 in various tissues of mice (e.g., in cardiomyocytes, neurons, hepatocytes, and T
and B cells) has no obvious effect on the development, behavior, reproduction and aging of
the animals (Hayashi and Lee, 2004), suggesting that BMK1 should be an attractive target
for pharmaceutical intervention in cancer therapy. However, the instability of the
vasculature observed in mice depleted of endothelial BMK1 (Hayashi et al., 2004) has
discouraged the therapeutic development of a BMK1 inhibitor. Compared to BMK1
knockout, which is much more severe as it leads to complete and irreversible annihilation of
BMK1 gene product in the tissues targeted, pharmaceutical inhibition of BMK1 only targets
the kinase activity of the enzyme. Therefore, we believe that applying the BMK1 inhibitor in
animals should have no or little unfavorable effect on vascular integrity. Indeed, we have
demonstrated that XMD8-92 is a very effective ATP-competitive inhibitor that inhibits
BMK1 activity in animals and reduces tumor growth by 95% without inducing vasculature
abnormalities (Table S4, S5 and Figure 1F). These results strengthen the notion that
blocking the BMK1 pathway may be an effective approach for treating human cancer.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
KiNativ Profiling Method

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

KiNativ profiling of XMD8-92 was carried out with both an ATP and ADP acylphosphatedesthiobiotin as described previously (Patricelli et al., 2007) with the following
modifications. HeLa cell lysates (5 mg/mL total protein) were incubated in the presence of
XMD8-92 at 50 μM, 10 μM, 2 μM, 0.8 μM, and 0 μM for 15 minutes prior to addition of the
ATP or ADP acylphosphate probe (5 μM final probe concentration). All reactions were
performed in duplicate. Probe reactions proceeded for 10 minutes and the reaction stopped
by the addition of urea and processed for MS analysis as described (Patricelli et al., 2007).
Samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a linear ion trap mass spectrometer using a time
segmented “target list” designed to collect MS/MS spectra from all kinase peptide-probe
conjugates that can be detected in HeLa cell lysates. This target list was generated and
validated by prior exhaustive analysis of HeLa lysates. Up to four characteristic fragment
ions for each kinase peptide-probe conjugate were used to extract signals for each kinase,
and a comparison of inhibitor treated to control (untreated) lysates allowed for precise
determination of % inhibition at each point. A manuscript describing the details of this
targeted mass spectrometry approach is in preparation.

respectively. HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC and were propagated in SILAC medium
for more than nine generations to ensure nearly 100% incorporation of labeled amino acids
before the experiment was performed. After being washed with precooled PBS buffer, HeLa
cells were lysed in E1A (250 mM NaCl, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.1% NP40, 5 mM
EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN)) or RIPA (1X PBS, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium
deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml PMSF, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis,
IN)) lysis buffer respectively. “Light” cell lysate and “Heavy” lysate were mixed at a 1:1
ratio, and the mixed lysates were incubated with the precipitating antibody for 8 hr, followed
by 16 hr incubation with protein G beads (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Immune complexes
were washed three times in lysis buffer (E1A or RIPA respectively) and once in sterile
water, and then incubated in 8 M urea for 30 min at room temperature. The supernatant was
reduced with DTT, and then alkylated with iodoacetamide. The resulting samples from E1A
or RIPA lysis buffer were dialyzed against 2 M urea/100 mM NH4HCO3 at 37°C for 5 hr
and then analyzed by Multidimensional Liquid Chromatography Coupled with Tandem
Mass Spectrometry (MudPIT) twice. Since the existence of the stable (heavy) isotope in
nature is less than 1%, any “light” peptide detected by MudPIT with no similar amount of
“heavy” peptide detected was considered as a contaminant.

randomized into 4 groups [Ad-EV, Ad-BMK1(AEF), Ad-EV+XMD8-92 and AdBMK1(AEF) +XMD8-92] (6 animals per group). Mice were injected intratumorally with
either empty adenovirus (Ad-EV) or recombinant adenovirus encoding BMK1(AEF) [AdBMK1(AEF)] on day 7, day 11, day 15, day 19, using the procedure previously described
(Kim et al., 2004). Ad-EV+XMD8-92 and Ad-BMK1 (AEF)+XMD8-92 groups were
treated with XMD8-92 from day 8 to day 20 using the procedure described in the LL/2
xenograft model. The other two groups [Ad-EV and Ad-BMK1(AEF)] received injections of
the carrier solution instead as control.

PML Reconstitution—PML shRNAi knockdown and control cell lines were built using
pGIPZ-shRNAmir-PML (Lentiviral) and pGIPZ (Lentiviral) plasmids from Openbiosystems
(Huntsville, AL). 1 × 106 knockdown (48 animals) or control (12 animals) LL/2 cells were
injected subcutaneously into C57Bl/6 mice (day 0). On the second day (day 1) after tumor
cell injection, mice were randomized into 10 groups (6 animals per group) [KD, Ctrl, KD
+XMD8-92 and Ctrl+XMD8-92; KD+Ad-EV, KD+Ad-PML, KD+Ad-PML2D(S403D/
T409D), KD+Ad-EV+XMD8-92, KD+Ad-PML+XMD8-92 and KD+Ad-PML2D(S403D/
T409D)+XMD8-92]. The KD+XMD8-92 and Ctrl+XMD8-92 groups were treated with
XMD8-92 at the dose of 50 mg/kg twice a day intraperitoneally for 16 days. The KD and
Ctrl groups received daily injections of the carrier solution as control for 16 days. The KD
+Ad-EV, KD+Ad-PML, KD+Ad-PML2D, KD+Ad-EV+XMD8-92, KD+Ad-PML
+XMD8-92 and KD+Ad-PML2D+XMD8-92 groups were injected intratumorally with
either empty adenovirus (Ad-EV), Ad-PML or Ad-PML2D recombinant adenovirus
encoding PML or PML2D on day 7, day 11, day 15, day 19, using the procedure previously
described (Kim et al., 2004). KD+Ad-EV+XMD8-92, KD+Ad-PML+XMD8-92 and KD
+Ad-PML2D+XMD8-92 groups were treated with XMD8-92 from day 8 to day 20 using
the procedure described in the LL/2 xenograft model. The KD+Ad-EV and KD+Ad-PML
and KD+Ad-PML2D groups received injections of the carrier solution instead as control.
A549 Xenograft Model—To ascertain that XMD8-92 can block BMK1 in vivo, 1 × 106
A549 cells, whose endogenous BMK1 autophosphorylation was detectable by western
blotting, were resuspended in DMEM and injected subcutaneously into the right flank of 6week-old Nod/Scid mice. On the 21st day after the injection, mice were randomized into 2
groups (2 animals per group). One group was treated with XMD8-92 at the dose of 50 mg/
kg twice a day. The other group was treated with the carrier solution as control. After 2
days, the A549 tumor was homogenized in E1A buffer followed by western blot analysis.

information (Figure S5).
Statistical Analysis
p values were calculated with the Student’s t test.
Significance
The BMK1/ERK5 pathway is the last discovered and the least studied mammalian MAP
kinase cascade. Herein, we describe the development of the small-molecule inhibitor for
BMK1 that is effective not only in cells but also in animals. Using this inhibitor, we
determined that BMK1 inhibits the tumor suppressor activity of cellular PML, and more
importantly, we demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of BMK1-targeted cancer
treatment in animals. As BMK1 is expressed in most, if not all, tumor cells, our results

(A) Chemical structure of XMD8-92.
(B) HeLa cells were serum starved overnight followed by treatment with 1 or 5 μM
XMD8-92 or 1 μM PD184352 as indicated for one hour. Cells were then stimulated with
EGF for 17 min and BMK1 activation was detected by mobility retardation (Abe et al.,
1996). ERK1/2 activation was detected by an anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (T202/Y204) antibody.
(C) HEK293 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids of MEK5D and BMK1.
After 48 hr, BMK1 was immunoprecipitated and in vitro kinase assays were performed in
the presence of the indicated amount of XMD8-92. The ATP concentration was measured
by the Kinase-Glo® Luminescent Kinase Assay Platform. Kinase activity is expressed
relative to the kinase activity in cells without XMD8-92 treatment, which was taken as 1. n
= 3, ± SEM.
(D) Expression plasmids of MEK5D and BMK1 were transfected into HEK293 as indicated.
After 36 hr, these cells were co-transfected with vectors for pCMV-β and the reporter
plasmid pG5ElbLuc along with a GAL4 fusion expression vector containing MEF2C for 3
hr and then treated with 5 μM XMD8-92 for a further 16 hr. The luciferase activities were
normalized against cells transfected with pG5ElbLuc and pGAL4 reporter plasmid alone,
whose value was taken as 1. n = 3, ± SEM, *p < 0.01.
(E) HeLa cells were infected with Ad-EV or Ad-BMK1(AEF), as indicated, 24 hr prior to
treatment with or without XMD8-92 (5 μM) for 48 hr, followed by MTT assays. % growth
