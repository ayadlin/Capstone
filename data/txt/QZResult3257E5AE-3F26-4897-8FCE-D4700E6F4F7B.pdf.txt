ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer is highly resistant to current chemotherapies. Identification of
the critical signaling pathways that mediate pancreatic cancer transformed growth is
necessary for the development of more effective therapeutic treatments. Recently, we
demonstrated that protein kinase C iota (PKCι) and zeta (PKCζ) promote pancreatic
cancer transformed growth and invasion, by activating Rac1→ERK and STAT3 signaling
pathways, respectively. However, a key question is whether PKCι and PKCζ play
redundant (or non-redundant) roles in pancreatic cancer cell transformed growth.
Here we describe the novel observations that 1) PKCι and PKCζ are non-redundant in
the context of the transformed growth of pancreatic cancer cells; 2) a gold-containing
small molecule known to disrupt the PKCι/Par6 interaction, aurothiomalate, also
disrupts PKCζ/Par6 interaction; 3) aurothiomalate inhibits downstream signaling of
both PKCι and PKCζ, and blocks transformed growth of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro;
and 4) aurothiomalate inhibits pancreatic cancer tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.
Taken together, these data provide convincing evidence that an inhibitor of atypical
PKC signaling inhibits two key oncogenic signaling pathways, driven non-redundantly
by PKCι and PKCζ, to significantly reduce tumor growth and metastasis. Our results
demonstrate that inhibition of atypical PKC signaling is a promising therapeutic
strategy to treat pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION

components of PKCι’s pro-cancer signaling complex,
and inhibiting PKCι oncogenic function [4]. Similar to
genetic inhibition of PKCι, ATM inhibits soft agar colony
formation of lung cancer cells in vitro and orthotopic lung
tumor growth and proliferation in vivo [4-6]. Auranofin
(ANF), a second small molecule gold-containing
compound in the same chemical class as ATM, inhibits
PKCι signaling in ovarian cancer, via a mechanism of
action similar to that of ATM [7]. PKCζ is structurally
similar to PKCι and also contains a cysteine residue in
the protein-binding region of the PB1 domain (Cys68);
therefore these gold-containing compounds are predicted
to disrupt PKCζ-mediated downstream signaling.
In the present study, we show that PKCι and PKCζ
play non-redundant, required roles in pancreatic cancer

Pancreatic cancer remains the fourth leading cause
of cancer deaths in the United States [1]. Pancreatic
cancer has a high propensity for resistance to current
chemotherapy treatments; thus molecular targeting of
multiple pathways necessary for tumor cell growth and
maintenance may be required for successful therapeutic
intervention. Recently, we demonstrated a role for the
atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isozymes, PKCι and
PKCζ, in the transformed growth and invasive phenotype
of pancreatic cancer cells [2, 3]. Aurothiomalate (ATM)
forms a thio-gold adduct with a cysteine residue within
the Phox-Bem1 (PB1) domain of PKCι (Cys69), thereby
blocking PB1 domain-mediated interactions with

cell transformed growth. We demonstrate for the first
time that ATM disrupts binding of PKCζ to partitioning
defective 6 homolog (Par6), an aPKC signaling partner,
and that inhibition of expression of Par6 significantly
reduces transformed growth and invasion of pancreatic
cancer cells, suggesting that aPKC/Par6 signaling is
an important mediator of the transformed phenotype of
pancreatic cancer cells. Furthermore, ATM inhibits the
transformed growth of pancreatic cancer cell in vitro and
tumor formation in vivo, demonstrating the therapeutic
potential of disrupting aPKC signaling.

significantly more than inhibition of either aPKC alone.
To test this hypothesis, Panc-1 cells were co-transfected
with NT and PKCι RNAi, NT and PKCζ RNAi, or PKCι
RNAi and PKCζ RNAi (Figure 1D), and assessed for
anchorage independent growth and cellular invasion. As
predicted, cells expressing both PKCι and PKCζ RNAi
produced significantly fewer colonies in soft agar (Figure
1E) and were significantly less invasive (Figure 1F) than
NT, PKCι or PKCζ RNAi cells. Taken together, these
data demonstrate that PKCι and PKCζ function in a nonredundant way to promote the transformed phenotype of
pancreatic cancer cells.

RESULTS

Par6 knockdown phenocopies aPKC knockdown
in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro

PKCι and PKCζ play non-redundant roles in the
transformed phenotype of pancreatic cancer

Par6 is a PB1 domain-containing protein that
interacts with aPKCs via PB1 domain-mediated
interactions [16]. The Par6-aPKC interaction is necessary
for the establishment and maintenance of the cell polarity
complex in non-transformed cells [17]. Furthermore, the
PB1 domain-mediated interaction of Par6 and PKCι is
required for PKCι oncogenic signaling in transformed
cells [4, 6, 18]. If the functional effects of PKCι and
PKCζ in pancreatic cancer cells require PB1 domainmediated interactions, then Par6 may also be required for
the transformed phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells. To
assess the role of Par6 in pancreatic cancer cells, Panc-1
and MIA PaCa-2 cells were stably transfected with control
(NT) RNAi or Par6-targeting RNAis (Figure 2A, Panc-1;
2B, MIA PaCa-2). Similar to the effect of knockdown of
PKCι or PKCζ, pancreatic cancer cells expressing Par6
RNAi exhibit significantly reduced anchorage independent
growth and cellular invasion, compared to cells expressing
NT RNAi (Figure 2C, Panc-1; Figure 2D, MIA PaCa-2).
These data indicate that oncogenic signaling of PKCι and
PKCζ requires PB1 domain-mediated interactions with
Par6 and also suggest that a small molecule inhibitor
targeting the PB1 domain interactions of aPKCs will
significantly reduce pancreatic cancer cell colony
formation and invasion.

We have previously shown that inhibition of
expression of either PKCι or PKCζ significantly
reduces pancreatic cancer cell anchorage-independent
growth and cellular invasion [2, 3]. Since PKCι and
PKCζ share significant homology (85% homologous
in the catalytic domains [15]), one interpretation of
this observation is that the atypical PKC isozymes play
redundant roles in the transformed growth of pancreatic
cancer cells. We therefore evaluated the ability of PKCι
to reconstitute the effects of PKCζ knockdown, and
PKCζ to reconstitute the effects of PKCι knockdown,
on the transformed phenotype of pancreatic cancer cell
lines. Panc-1 cells expressing control NT RNAi, PKCι
RNAi or PKCζ RNAi were co-transfected with empty
(control) vector, or vector expressing PKCι or PKCζ
(Figure 1A). As expected, cells expressing PKCι RNAi
or PKCζ RNAi formed significantly fewer colonies
in soft agar than cells expressing NT RNAi (Figure
1B). Similarly, cells expressing PKCι RNAi or PKCζ
RNAi exhibited significantly reduced invasion through
matrigel in a transwell invasion assay, compared to Panc1 cells expressing NT RNAi (Figure 1C). Interestingly,
expression of exogenous PKCι, but not PKCζ, was
able to significantly reconstitute the effects of PKCι
RNAi on pancreatic cancer cell growth in soft agar and
invasion (Figure 1B and 1C). Conversely, expression of
exogenous PKCζ, but not PKCι, was able to significantly
reconstitute the effects of PKCζ RNAi on pancreatic
cancer cell growth in soft agar and invasion (Figure 1B
and 1C). These data indicate that PKCι and PKCζ play
non-redundant roles in the maintenance of the transformed
phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells. Consistent with
this observation, we have shown that PKCι and PKCζ
are preferentially coupled to distinct cancer-promoting
signaling pathways in pancreatic cancer cells [2, 3]. Thus
we hypothesized that inhibition of expression of both
PKCι and PKCζ would reduce the transformed phenotype

ATM inhibits aPKC signaling in vitro
A high throughput screen of FDA-approved
drugs identified small molecule inhibitors of PKCι-Par6
PB1-domain interactions [6]. ATM, a gold-containing
compound identified with this screen, significantly inhibits
PKCι-mediated transformed growth of lung cancer cells,
in vitro and in vivo [4, 9, 19]. Gold-containing compounds
are known to be thio-reactive, covalently modifying
proteins by formation of thio-gold adducts with reactive
cysteine residues [20]. ATM selectively modifies the
Cys69 residue within the OPCA motif of the PKCι
PB1 domain and disrupts the PKCι-Par6 PB1 domain

interaction in a dose-dependent manner [6]. Interestingly,
a similar cysteine residue is found in the PB1 domain of
PKCζ (Cys68), but not in any other known PB1 domains
[15]. The PB1 domain of PKCζ binds Par6 in a specific
manner (Figure 3A). As predicted by the presence of the
ATM-modifiable cysteine within the PKCζ PB1 domain,
ATM also inhibits the binding of the PB1 domain of PKCζ
to Par6 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3B), with an
IC50 value (3.0 µM) similar to the IC50 value calculated
for disruption of PKCι-Par6 PB1 domain interaction [6].
PKCι, PKCζ and Par6 are required for pancreatic
cancer cell transformed growth; thus, we hypothesized
that molecular inhibition of aPKC PB1-domain-mediated

interactions will inhibit the transformed signaling of both
PKCι and PKCζ. Panc-1 and MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic
cancer cell lines were treated with ATM for 48hrs and then
assayed for Rac1 activity. ATM treatment inhibits Rac1
activity in pancreatic cancer cells (Figure 4A) consistent
with inhibition of PKCι signaling [2]. Additionally,
ATM inhibits STAT3 activation, as detected by a
significant decrease in phosphorylation of Y705 (Figure
4B), consistent with inhibition of PKCζ signaling [3] .
These data indicate that ATM inhibits pancreatic cancer
oncogenic signaling pathways regulated by both PKCι and
PKCζ in vitro.

ATM inhibited pancreatic cancer cell invasion in a dosedependent manner (Figure 4E). Recently, another thiogold-containing compound, ANF, has been shown to

DISCUSSION

S1B) of pancreatic cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent
manner. These data indicate that clinically relevant
therapies targeting aPKCs can inhibit the transformed
phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells,
We hypothesized that the effect of ATM on the
transformed phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells is
due to inhibition of both PKCι and PKCζ. We therefore
predicted that pancreatic cancer cells expressing either
PKCι or PKCζ RNAi would retain sensitivity to ATMmediated inhibition of anchorage-independent growth
and invasion. As predicted, ATM treatment of pancreatic
cancer cells expressing PKCι RNAi further reduced
anchorage-independent growth (Figure 5A) and cellular
invasion (Figure 5B). Likewise, ATM further reduced
anchorage-independent growth (Figure 5A) and invasion
of pancreatic cancer cells expressing PKCζ RNAi (Figure
5B). Furthermore, combined knockdown of PKCι and
PKCζ by RNAi inhibited invasion to a level similar to
the effect of ATM treatment (Figure 5C); these cells were
insensitive to additional inhibition by ATM treatment,
indicating that PKCι and PKCζ are the primary cellular
targets for ATM-mediated inhibition (Figure 5C).

We have previously shown that both PKCι and
PKCζ play promotive roles in the transformed growth
of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [2, 3]. In
the present study, we first demonstrate that PKCι and
PKCζ play non-redundant roles in pancreatic cancer,
and that knockdown of both PKCι and PKCζ results
in significant, additive inhibition of the transformed
phenotype compared to inhibition of either aPKC alone.
These data extend our previous observations that PKCι
and PKCζ are preferentially coupled to distinct procancer signaling pathways in pancreatic cancer [2, 3].
PKCι promotes the transformed phenotype of pancreatic
cancer, at least in part, via activation of Rac1-MEK/ERK
signaling [2], whereas a major mechanism by which PKCζ
regulates pancreatic cancer cell transformed growth is via
promotion of STAT3 activation [3]. Therefore, an inhibitor
targeting both aPKCs would simultaneously inhibit two
critical oncogenic signaling pathways in pancreatic cancer.
In addition to pancreatic cancer, PKCι has been
shown to play an oncogenic/cancer-promoting role in
lung, ovarian, and colon cancers (reviewed in Murray
et al. [21]). The oncogenic role of PKCι has been
particularly well-described in lung cancer, where PKCι
is required for oncogenic K-ras-induced tumor initiation
and progression in a mouse model of lung cancer, as
well as for maintenance of the transformed phenotype of
human lung cancer cells [5, 18, 22]. Further investigation
of the mechanism of PKCι oncogenic signaling in lung
cancer revealed that PKCι mediates its effects by forming
an oncogenic signaling complex through interactions
involving its PB1-domain [4, 9, 19].
A high throughput screen of a library of FDAapproved drugs for compounds that disrupted the PB1
domain-mediated interaction between PKCι and Par6
identified several gold-containing compounds, used
clinically for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [6].
One of the gold-containing drugs identified as a PKCι
PB1 domain interaction disruptor, ATM, inhibits lung
cancer cell transformed growth in vitro and in vivo [6, 19].
FDA-approved gold-containing small molecules have
been used clinically for over 30 years for the treatment
of rheumatoid arthritis [23]. While the mechanism of
action of gold-containing drugs in the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis has never been fully elucidated, the
inhibition of mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase has
been suggested as a mediator of therapeutic response [20].
Thioredoxin reductase is considered an important target
for immunosuppression in the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis, since thioredoxin reductase is highly expressed
in the synovial cells of rheumatoid arthritis patients
[24]. Other hypothesized mechanisms of action of goldcontaining compound-induced immunosuppression are
inhibition of IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling and inhibition
of NF-κB [25-27]. Recent evaluation of gold-containing

ATM inhibits pancreatic orthotopic tumor
growth, aPKC regulated signaling and metastasis
in vivo
We next investigated the effect of ATM treatment
on pancreatic tumor growth using a previously
described Panc-1 orthotopic tumor model [2]. Panc-1
cells expressing the firefly luciferase gene (pSIN-Fluc)
were injected into the pancreas of nude mice and tumor
growth was monitored by bioluminescence (Figure 6A).
Mice were treated with either 60mg/kg ATM or saline
by daily IP injections for 5 weeks. Tumor formation was
observed in all mice; however, mice treated with ATM
had significantly lower final tumor weight compared to
those treated with saline (Figure 6A and 6B). Tumor cell
proliferation was also significantly reduced in tumors
from ATM-treated mice (Figure 6C). Additionally, tumors
from ATM-treated mice had a significant increase in
apoptosis (Figure 6D), and tumor necrosis (Figure 6E).
These data indicate that the reduced tumor size in ATMtreated mice is due to a combination of decreased tumor
cell proliferation and increased cell death. p-ERK1/2 and
p-STAT3 levels were reduced in tumors from ATM-treated
mice (Figure 6F), consistent with the effects of inhibition
of PKCι [2], and PKCζ [3], respectively, demonstrating
target engagement in vivo. Furthermore, significantly
fewer metastases to distal organs were detected in mice
treated with ATM compared to saline-treated mice (Figure
6G). These data demonstrate that pharmacological
inhibition of aPKCs is a promising therapeutic approach
for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

rheumatoid arthritis drugs for anti-cancer properties has
revealed both apoptotic and cytotoxic effects in various
cancer cell types, including breast, ovarian and leukemia
[28-31]. These studies investigated multiple potential
targets for the anti-cancer effects of these drugs, including
inhibition of thioredoxin reductase, STAT3 signaling,
proteasome-associated deubiquitinases and telomerase
[28-31]. While the mechanism of action of gold-containing
drugs in most cancer types remains poorly understood,
mechanistic studies in lung cancer cells demonstrate that
ATM-mediated inhibition of transformed growth requires
the gold-modifiable Cys69 residue in the PKCι PB1
domain, demonstrating the necessity for PKCι inhibition
for the anti-tumor effects of ATM in lung cancer cells [4,
6, 19]. Furthermore, sensitivity to ATM-mediated growth
inhibition in lung cancer cells correlates directly with
expression of PKCι and Par6 but not to other proposed
ATM targets such as thioredoxin reductases [19].
Similar to PKCι, the PB1 domain of PKCζ contains
a cysteine residue at position 68; thus we hypothesized
that ATM would disrupt PKCζ PB1 domain-mediated
interactions in a similar manner to its effect on PKCι-Par6
interactions [4, 16]. Indeed, in vitro analysis demonstrated
that ATM disrupts the interaction of the PKCζ PB1 domain
and Par6 with an IC50 value similar to that characterized

for a PKCι-Par6 interaction [4, 6]. We next evaluated the
therapeutic potential of pharmacological inhibition of both
PKCι and PKCζ in pancreatic cancer cells. ATM inhibited
both PKCι- and PKCζ-regulated signaling pathways in
pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Likewise, ATM
inhibited the transformed growth of pancreatic cancer
cells in vitro and in vivo, similar to the effect of genetic
inhibition of PKCι and PKCζ. These data demonstrate
that ATM is able to simultaneously target both PKCι
and PKCζ, thereby inhibiting two critical pathways in
pancreatic cancer (Figure 7).
In addition to ATM, ANF, a gold-containing drug
used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, has been evaluated
for anti-cancer activity. ANF was shown to inhibit PKCι
signaling in ovarian cancer cells, and inhibit PKCιmediated transformed growth, similar to the effect of ATM
in lung cancer cells [4, 7]. Previously published structureactivity studies of gold (I) complexes demonstrated that
derivatives containing a phosphine group (ANF but not
ATM) have increased cytotoxic effects against cancer cells
[32], and that in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor
effects are related to the increased lipophilicity provided
by the phosphine group [33]. Likewise, we observed
that ANF inhibited anchorage-independent growth and
invasion in pancreatic cancer cells with a greater potency

than ATM (Figure 4 and Supplemental Figure 1). Taken
together, we show that gold-containing compounds inhibit
the transformed growth of pancreatic cancer cell lines by
inhibiting PKCι- and PKCζ-regulated signaling pathways.
These data further support the therapeutic potential of
targeting the aPKCs in pancreatic cancer.
Unlike several other cancers, the lethality of
pancreatic cancer has gradually increased over the
past decade [1] and thus the need for more successful
treatments has grown more critical. Our previous work
identified the aPKCs, PKCι and PKCζ, as potential
therapeutic targets for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
ATM and ANF have been shown to specifically inhibit
PKCι signaling and tumor growth in lung [6, 19] and
ovarian cancer models [7]. Recently, ATM was evaluated
in a phase I clinical trial of patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers
[34]. This study identified a maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) for ATM corresponding to serum gold levels above
the level necessary to successfully inhibit aPKC signaling
and reduce tumor growth in preclinical models, indicating
the clinical relevance of ATM and gold-containing
compounds for the treatment of cancers in which aPKC
signaling promotes the cancer phenotype [19, 34]. In the
present study, we provide pre-clinical evidence that ATM
disrupts aPKC signaling and inhibits the transformed
phenotype in pancreatic cancer, and demonstrate that
aPKCs are the major target of ATM-mediated inhibition
of the transformed phenotype. Therefore aPKC inhibitors
may be a promising new treatment option for pancreatic
cancer patients. Future clinical studies are necessary to
determine the efficacy of ATM and ANF for the treatment
of pancreatic cancer.

transfected with pBabe, pBabe-PKCι [10] or pBabePKCζ. Cell populations carrying the viral constructs were
selected and maintained by inclusion of puromycin in the
culture media.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and cell culture
Human pancreatic cancer cell lines were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection and
all experiments were performed with cells passaged
less than 6 months. Human pancreatic cancer cell lines
were maintained in a 5% CO2 humidified tissue culture
incubator in DMEM (Panc-1, MIA PaCa-2, and CFPAC)
or IMDM (Capan-1) with 10% (fetal bovine serum) FBS
as recommended by American Type Culture Collection.
Antibodies were obtained from the following sources:
PKCζ, β-actin, phospho-STAT3 (Y705), STAT3, phosphoERK1/2, ERK1/2 and cleaved caspase-3 (all from
Cell Signaling Technologies), PKCι (BD Transduction
Laboratories), and 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd)
(DakoCytomation). GST-PAK1-p21 binding domain
(PBD) beads were generated as previously described [8].
Briefly, BL21 bacteria harboring the fusion protein GSTwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Anchorage-independent growth assays
Pancreatic cancer cells (7x103) were plated in soft
agar and assessed for anchorage-independent growth as
described previously [2, 3].

Cellular invasion assay
Cellular invasion was assayed using Matrigel-coated
invasion chambers (BD Biosciences) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 5×104 human pancreatic
15307

Oncotarget

cancer cells were plated in serum-free media in the top
chamber, and media containing 2.5% FBS was used as
the chemo-attractant in the bottom chamber. Cells were
allowed to invade for 18hrs at 37°C and then cells were
fixed, stained and quantitated as previously described [11].

imaging, mice were injected intraperitoneally (IP) with
150 mg/kg body weight D-Luciferin solution (Xenogen),
anesthetized with isoflurane and imaged using a
bioluminescence imaging system (IVIS Imaging Spectrum
System). Bioluminescence was calculated using IVIS
Imaging Spectrum software. Week 1 bioluminescence
was used to distribute mice evenly between saline and
ATM treatment groups. One hour prior to sacrifice,
mice were injected IP with 100µg/g BrdUrd. All of the
animal experiments were approved by the Mayo Clinic
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

PKCζ and Par6 binding assay
Streptavidin-coated 96-well singleplex plates
(MesoScale Discovery, Rockville, MD) were blocked
with 5% non-fat dry milk for 1hr at room temperature.
Wells were washed twice with PBS/Tween. After washing,
recombinant biotinylated human Par6 protein was bound
by incubation at room temperature for 1 hr. GST-tagged
PKCζ N-terminal fragment (amino acids 1-113) or GST
control were purified via B-PER GST Protein Purification
Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and labeled with Sulfo-Tag
NHS-Ester for 2 hrs. After removing the free SulfoTag NHS-Ester reagents, increasing concentrations of
purified protein was added to Par6 coated plates. After
overnight incubation at 4°C, the wells were washed once
with PBS/Tween and 150µl of 1x Reading Buffer was
added. Binding to Par6 was determined by detection of
electrochemiluminescent signal emitted from the SulfoTag (620 nm), using a SECTOR Imager 2400 (Meso Scale
Discovery). To determine the effect of ATM on PKCζ
binding to Par6, 0.4µM of GST-tagged PKCζ (1-113) was
added to each well along with ATM to achieve the desired
final concentration as indicated in the figure, and binding
detected as described.

Orthotopic tumor analysis
Formalin-fixed pancreatic tumors were analyzed
by immunohistochemical (IHC) detection of BrdUrd
incorporation, as described previously [12-14]. Orthotopic
pancreatic tumors were evaluated for apoptosis by IHC
detection of cleaved caspase-3 as previously described
[14]. Tumor necrosis was identified in H&E stained
tissue as described previously [3]. Tumors were fixed
by perfusion with 10% paraformaldehyde at the time
of harvest for detection of expression of p-ERK1/2 and
p-STAT3 by IHC analysis. p-ERK1/2 and p-STAT3
staining was visualized using the Envision Plus AntiRabbit Labeled Polymer-HRP (Dako). Images were
captured and analyzed using Aperio Spectrum software.
Staining with only the secondary antibody served as a
negative control. Tumor metastases were identified by
detection of bioluminescence by ex vivo IVIS imaging
of isolated organs and confirmed by examination of H&E
stained tissue sections of the distal organs.

Rac1 activity assay

Statistical analysis

Pancreatic cancer cells treated with saline or ATM
were harvested and assayed for the presence of active,
GTP-bound Rac1. Rac1-GTP was precipitated from cell
extracts with PAK-1 PBD agarose beads as described
previously [10].

Two-way ANOVA, Student t-test or Fisher Exact
(tumor metastasis) were used to evaluate the statistical
significance of the results. p < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells (1 x 10 )
carrying the pSIN-Fluc luciferase expression vector were
mixed with growth factor-reduced Matrigel (Becton
Dickinson) and injected into the proximal pancreas (n=15
mice/group respectively) of 4-6 week old athymic nude
mice. All surgeries were performed under isoflurane
anesthesia, and mice were administered buprenorphine as
an analgesic immediately before and ~18 hours after the
surgery to minimize animal discomfort. Tumor-bearing
mice were monitored daily for signs of distress and twice
weekly for weight loss. Mice received IP injections of
saline or 60mg/kg ATM 5 days/week, beginning on day 8
and continuing until one day prior to sacrifice. For weekly
