Abstract
Synthetic progesterone used in contraception drugs (progestins) can promote breast cancer growth, but the
mechanisms involved are unknown. Moreover, it remains unclear whether cytoplasmic interactions between the
progesterone receptor (PR) and estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) are required for PR activation. In this study, we
used a murine progestin-dependent tumor to investigate the role of ERa in progestin-induced tumor cell
proliferation. We found that treatment with the progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) induced the
expression and activation of ERa, as well as rapid nuclear colocalization of activated ERa with PR. Treatment with
the pure antiestrogen fulvestrant to block ERa disrupted the interaction of ERa and PR in vitro and induced the
regression of MPA-dependent tumor growth in vivo. ERa blockade also prevented an MPA-induced increase in
CYCLIN D1 (CCND1) and MYC expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that MPA triggered
binding of ERa and PR to the CCND1 and MYC promoters. Interestingly, blockade or RNAi-mediated silencing of
ERa inhibited ERa, but not PR binding to both regulatory sequences, indicating that an interaction between ERa
and PR at these sites is necessary for MPA-induced gene expression and cell proliferation. We conﬁrmed that
nuclear colocalization of both receptors also occurred in human breast cancer samples. Together, our ﬁndings
argued that ERa–PR association on target gene promoters is essential for progestin-induced cell proliferation.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and a
leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide (1).
Although most of the evidence suggests estrogens as the major
etiologic factor in breast cancer (2), experimental and epidemiologic evidence, reviewed recently (3–5), also points to the
involvement of progesterone receptors (PR) in breast cancer
development and progression. However, the mechanisms by
which PR participate in tumor growth are not yet well understood. Considering that PR is usually used as a marker of
estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) functionality (6), it may be
intuitive to think that there is a sequential effect on ERa
inducing PR expression. It has been reported that an early

cytoplasmic interaction between ERa and PR isoform B (PRB)
is necessary to activate c-Src/p21ras/Erk cascade by progestins
(7), which in turn phosphorylates PR. Moreover, the regions
through which both receptors interact have been identiﬁed (8).
Conversely, Boonyaratanakornkit and colleagues have proposed that a polyproline motif in the amino-terminal domain
of PR is sufﬁcient to mediate c-Src tyrosine kinase activation by
progestins (9).
Using a progestin-dependent murine mammary carcinoma,
C4-HD (10) and the human T47D breast cancer cells, which are
also stimulated by progestins (11, 12), we show that a genomic
interaction between ERa and PR is essential for progestininduced gene expression and tumor cell proliferation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using T47D cells, conﬁrms
that PR is activated in the absence of ERa. However, the
presence of both activated receptors at the MYC or CYCLIN
D1 (CCND1) promoters is required to trigger gene expression
and cell proliferation. Moreover, the nuclear colocalization of
both receptors in human breast cancer samples suggests that a
genomic interaction between activated ERa and PR may be a
common event in breast cancer growth.

from Vector Labs.
Reagents
40 , 6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, 10 nmol/L), and RU-38486 (RU, 10 nmol/L)
were purchased from Sigma. ICI 182.780 (ICI) was a gift from
AstraZeneca.
Animals
Two-month-old virgin female BALB/c mice (IByME-Animal
Facility) were used. Animal care and manipulation were in
agreement with institutional and reference guidelines (13).
In vivo experiments
Depot MPA (20 mg) was used as a progestin. C4-HD tumors
were subcutaneously transplanted into MPA-treated BALB/c
mice as previously described (10). When tumors reached a size
of approximately 50 mm2, 6 mice were treated subcutaneously,
as described (14), with Fulvestrant (FUL; AstraZeneca), 6
received no other treatment, and the MPA depot was removed
in another 6 mice.
Human breast cancer tissue samples
Breast cancer resection specimens from 15 patients immediately frozen at 70 C were provided by Bancario Hospital,
Buenos Aires. The study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board.
Cell lines
Human T47D cells obtained from American Type Culture
Collection were validated by Genetica DNA Laboratories Inc.
by short tandem repeat proﬁling and maintained as described
(15). Passages lower than 15 were used.
Cell proliferation
Primary cultures of C4-HD tumors were carried out as
described previously (16). Cell proliferation was evaluated by
either [3H]-thymidine uptake (16) or cell counting. C4-HD and
T47D cells were plated with Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's
Medium/F12 (Sigma) plus 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; BioSer)
for 48 hours. After starving for 24 hours with 1% steroidstripped FCS (chFCS), the cultures were incubated with the
experimental solutions.
Gene silencing
T47D cells were seeded in 12- or 96-well plates and
transfected with short interfering RNAs (siRNA) to human

ERa (ESR1_8 and ESR1_10, QIAGEN), human CCND1 (ONTARGETplus SMARTpool CCND1 from Thermo, or a pool of
CCND1_5 and CCND1_6 from QIAGEN), or a nonspeciﬁc
siRNA (SI03650318, QIAGEN) using HiPerFect transfection
reagent (QIAGEN). Cells were used 48 hours posttransfection.
Immunohistochemistry
Sections of formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tissues were
reacted with different antibodies using the avidin–biotin
peroxidase complex technique (Vector Lab) and counterstained with hematoxylin (17). Positive cells were counted in
10 high-power ﬁelds (HPF, 1,000) of each section and
expressed as the mean  SEM of the percentage of the
ratios between the number of events and the cell number/
HPF.
Immunoﬂuorescence and colocalization
Tumors. Frozen tumor sections were ﬁxed in formalin,
postﬁxed in 70% ethanol, blocked, and incubated with the
primary antibodies and ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate/TX-conjugated secondary antibodies, and counterstained with DAPI as
described previously (18). Images were obtained using a Nikon
Eclipse E800 Confocal Microscope and Nikon DS-U1 with ACT2U software.
Cells. Cultures growing on chamber slides were ﬁxed in
70% ethanol and processed as described previously (18). To
quantify nuclear colocalization of PR and ERa, we used the
Pearson's correlation coefﬁcient (Rr). Nuclei (200) of selected
samples were analyzed by using PSC Colocalization plug-in
(ImageJ-NIH; ref. 19). Rr ranges between 1 (perfect negative
correlation) to þ1 (perfect positive correlation) with 0 meaning no correlation.
Tumor and cell extracts
Tumors were homogenized and processed to obtain nuclear
puriﬁed fractions (20) and total cell extracts prepared using MPER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce). Nuclear
cell culture extracts were obtained and proteins quantiﬁed as
described previously (21).
Immunoprecipitation assays
Nuclear extracts containing 0.5 to 1 mg of proteins were
subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using 2 mg of PR or ERa
antibodies and rocked overnight at 4 C. The immunocomplexes were then captured by adding protein A-agarose (Santa
Cruz) processed as described (18) and subjected to Western
blots.
Western blots
Tumor, cell extracts (100 mg proteins/lane), or immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on discontinuous polyacrylamide gels and detected as previously described (20).
Activation of reporter genes
The PRE-Luc vector used was a gift from Dr. C. Gardmo
(Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; ref. 22) and assays
were conducted as described previously (18).

RNA preparation and real-time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cultures with TRIzol Reagent
(Invitrogen) and converted to cDNA as described previously
(18). Speciﬁc oligos for human MYC (NM_002467.4) and CCND1
(NM_053056.2) were designed using Primer-Blast (NCBI; Supplementary Table S1). GAPDH (NM_002046.3) expression was
used as a normalization control. Data from 3 experiments were
combined to determine gene expression changes using 2(–DCt)
formula. A melting curve was generated for every run to
conﬁrm assay speciﬁcity.
ChIP and sequential ChIP assays
After treatment, cells were ﬁxed with 1% paraformaldehyde
for 30 minutes; ChIP assays carried out as recommended by
Diagenode using the HighCell# ChIP kit. Speciﬁc oligos for
human CCND1 and MYC promoters were designed using
Primer-Blast (NCBI; Supplementary Table S1). The data from
each immunoprecipitate (IgG, PR, and ERa) was normalized
to the corresponding inputs of chromatin before IP, normalized to IgG/input data, and expressed as relative to the
control. Five experiments were combined to determine receptor binding to gene promoters. Sequential ChIP (ChIP-reChIP)
was carried out using the Re-ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif). Data
from each sequential immunoprecipitates (PR/ERa and ERa/
PR) were normalized to the corresponding inputs before IP,
normalized to IP IgG/IgG data, and expressed as relative to
the control.
Statistical analysis
ANOVA and Tukey multiple post t test were used to evaluate
differences of means of multiple samples, and Student t test
was used to compare means of 2 different groups. In all graphs,
the mean  SEM is shown, and experiments were repeated at
least 3 times. Signiﬁcant differences between control and
treated cells were indicated with asterisk ( , P < 0.05;  , P <
0.01;  , P < 0.001).

Results
ERas plays a key role in C4-HD tumor growth in vivo
We have previously shown that C4-HD tumors that express
ERa and PR grow in MPA- or progesterone (Pg)-treated female
mice (10) and that the blockade of PR induces complete tumor
regression (23). This experimental system provided an opportunity to explore the role of ERa in progestin-induced tumor
growth by using the pure antiestrogen FUL. Surprisingly, FUL
induced a complete regression of tumors growing in the
presence of MPA (Fig. 1A), and this was associated with a
decrease in both PR isoforms and ERa expression, as evaluated
by Western blot (Fig. 1B) and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1C).
Expression of ERa after MPA withdrawal was negligible,
however, a signiﬁcant increase in PR was observed after MPA
removal, suggesting that, in the progestin-dependent C4-HD
tumor, although MPA downregulates PR expression, it may be
required to maintain high levels of ERa expression in vivo (Fig.
1C). Moreover, activated ERa (pSer167 and pSer118 ERa) was
also high in MPA-treated tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1A).

FUL-induced tumor regression was associated with a cytostatic effect, as shown by a decrease in the mitotic index (Ki67
quantiﬁcation, Supplementary Fig. S1B), and in the expression
of 2 progestin-regulated proteins, CCND1 and MYC (Fig. 1C). In
addition, in FUL-treated tumors, an increase in apoptosis
(Supplementary Fig. S1B), associated with a decrease in
BCL/XL, and an increase in BAX and AIF (Supplementary Fig.
S1C) expression were observed. These results indicated that
activated ERa contributes to progestin-dependent tumor
growth.

ERa and PR interact in the nuclei of MPA-stimulated
C4-HD cells in vitro and this interaction is necessary
to induce cell proliferation
The fact that high levels of PR, but not of ERa, were observed
in the nuclei of C4-HD tumors after MPA removal, led to
hypothesize that both receptors participated in growth stimulation. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the blockade of
ERa on MPA-induced cell proliferation and the role of MPA on
ERa and PR expression in vitro. In C4-HD cultures, ICI inhibited MPA-induced proliferation as shown by [3H]-thymidine
uptake (16), cell counting (Fig. 2A), or bromodeoxyuridine
staining (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Similarly, blocking ERa
expression using siRNAs also inhibited the MPA-induced
increase in [3H]-thymidine uptake (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
A time course analysis of ERa and PR expression after ICI
treatment showed an early downregulation of ERa (6 hours),
although high levels of PR were still detected after 24 hours
(Supplementary Fig. S2C), indicating that the blockade of MPAinduced cell proliferation by ICI was not associated with PR
downregulation.
An increase in both nuclear ERa and PR immunoreactivity
and nuclear colocalization was observed in MPA-treated cells
(Fig. 2B). A time course analysis of the interaction revealed that
they start colocalizing as early as 5 minutes after MPA
incubation with a decrease after 1 hour (Fig. 2B). In cells
treated for 30 minutes with MPAþICI, there was a decrease
in nuclear and an increase in cytosolic ERa staining (Fig. 2C
left, arrows). These results suggested that ICI disrupts the
molecular interaction induced by MPA. Similar incubations
were done with the corresponding phospho-receptor antibodies. Phospho-Ser118 ERa staining increased after 30
minutes of MPA treatment and colocalized with pSer162
PRB (Fig. 2C, middle) or pSer294 PR (Fig. 2C, right). These
observations suggested that ERa and PR may be forming
part of the same complexes in their active state (24). No
cytosolic or membrane colocalization of PR and ERa was
observed in MPA-treated cells and no staining was observed
in hormone receptor–negative murine LM3 (25) breast
cancer cells (data not shown). Moreover, using frozen samples from C4-HD tumors growing in MPA-treated mice, we
conﬁrmed the nuclear colocalization between PR/ERa in
vivo (Fig. 2D, left). Finally, we corroborated the interaction
between both receptors by co-IP assays using nuclear
extracts from MPA-treated C4-HD tumors. Proteins were
immunoprecipitated with 2 different PR or ERa antibodies
and blotted accordingly (Fig. 2D, right). These results

suggested that both PR isoforms can participate in a nuclear
complex with ERa.
Nuclear interaction between ERa and PR in human
breast cancer
To investigate whether the colocalization between ERa
and PR was unique for our murine model, we evaluated the
expression of ERa, PR, and pPR in 15 frozen breast cancer
samples. In 4 of them (2 ductal and 2 lobular carcinomas),
we found a high degree of nuclear colocalization (Fig. 3A).
We found a mild colocalization in 3 samples and a sporadic
colocalization in other 2 samples. No staining was observed
in receptor negative tumors (Fig. 3B). Co-IP assays carried
out using puriﬁed nuclear extracts from 2 positive samples
and a negative control conﬁrmed the nuclear interaction
between ERa and PR (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that
the interaction between ERa and PR has an important and
yet unexplored role in human breast cancer.

ERa and PR interaction in the nuclei of progestinstimulated T47D cells is necessary to induce cell
proliferation
To further investigate the role of ERa in MPA-induced cell
proliferation we used T47D cells. MPA increased the nuclear
colocalization between ERa and PR during the ﬁrst 5 to 10
minutes and then a decrease was observed after 30 minutes of
treatment (Fig. 4A). No cytosolic or membrane colocalization
of PR and ERa was observed. Using phospho-speciﬁc antibodies, we showed that pSer162 PRB and pSer294 PR colocalized with ERa after 10 minutes of MPA incubation (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). Puriﬁed nuclear extracts from
untreated or MPA-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with
PR or ERa antibodies. We observed a signiﬁcant increase in
pSer294 PR (P < 0.01) and in ERa (P < 0.05), or in total PR (P <
0.01), respectively, as compared with immunoprecipitates from
untreated cells (Fig. 4B). Cellular fractionation was controlled
by Western blot using anti-tubulin or anti-Sp1 antibodies

The inhibition of ERa expression prevents MPA-induced
CCND1 and MYC expression in T47D cells
As part of their proliferative activity, progestins induce the
expression of CCND1 (18, 26–30) and MYC (18, 31, 32) mRNA in
T47D cells. We analyzed their time-dependent expression in
response to MPA. We observed an early increase (15 minutes) after MPA incubation that lasted 24 hours, except for a
decrease observed 1 hour (CCND1) or 3 hours (MYC) after
treatment (Fig. 5A). The increase in mRNA correlated with
an early and gradual increase in protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S4). The knockdown of CCND1 using siRNAs
prevented DNA synthesis triggered by MPA (Fig. 5B). We
therefore used ICI or siRNAs to analyze the contribution of
ERa to gene transcription activated by MPA. The inhibition
of ERa blocked the MPA-dependent transcription of both
CCND1 and MYC genes (Fig. 5C and D). All this data
suggested that ERa activity, presumably through its ability
to interact with PR by forming nuclear complexes, can
control the expression of key proliferative genes in response
to progestins.
ERa inhibition blocks the MPA-induced activation of
reporter genes and prevents ERa, but not PR binding to
CCND1 and MYC promoters in T47D cells
To further understand the role of ERa mediating MPA
transcriptional activities, we evaluated the effect of ICI on the
activation of a reporter luciferase assay controlled by the
progesterone response element (PRE) sequence in T47D cells.
ICI inhibited MPA-induced PRE-luc expression (Fig. 6A) and
induced the downregulation of ERa, whereas PR was still
expressed even after 48 hours of ICI incubation (Supplementary Fig. S3D). Moreover, MPA induced a higher PRE-luc

activity in MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with PRB,
when they were cotransfected with ERa (Supplementary Fig.
S5). These results strongly suggested a role for the PR/ERa
complexes in the regulatory elements of MPA-regulated genes.
To conﬁrm the binding of both receptors to the same promoter
regions, we used ChIP analysis on CCND1 and MYC regulatory
sequences. In Fig. 6B we show a schematic representation of
both gene promoters, highlighting the PRE and estrogen
response element (ERE) sites in each case, as well as the
primers used in ChIP/qPCR analysis. Cells were incubated
with MPA (10 minutes) and the chromatin subjected to IP with
PR- or ERa-speciﬁc antibodies. DNA fragments were ampliﬁed
by qPCR with 3 pairs of primers for each gene, previously used
by others to report PR binding to those sequences
(refs. 31, 33, 34; Fig. 6B). The recruitment of ERa and PR to
the sites at þ5 to 6 Kb (ChIP primers C) was used as a negative
control of receptor binding (Fig. 6B). Speciﬁc binding of both
receptors was detected at the same promoter regions in each
gene (ChIP primers A and B) after MPA treatment (Fig. 6C and
D, left and middle panels). We then evaluated whether PR and
ERa were simultaneously bound to the CCND1 and MYC gene
promoters by using a sequential ChIP assay. PR or ERa
antibodies were used in the ﬁrst IP, and ERa or PR antibodies
in the sequential ChIP (reChIP). qPCR analysis clearly showed
that PR and ERa co-occupy the CCND1 and MYC promoters
after 10 minutes of MPA stimulation (Figs. 6C and D, right
panels). These ﬁndings suggested that progestins induce the
assembly of PR/ERa protein complexes at both promoters to
control its transcriptional activation in breast cancer cells.
To further understand the molecular mechanism driving
these effects, we evaluated ERa and PR binding to these
regulatory sequences when we inhibited ERa. PR binding to

both gene promoters was unaffected by the presence of ICI
(Fig. 7A) or siRNA to ERa (Fig. 7B), although they did prevent
ERa binding. These data indicated that both proteins need to
interact at the CCND1 and MYC promoters to induce gene
transcription and cell proliferation, supporting our hypothesis
that the presence of ERa at those promoters is required to
induce PR-mediated gene expression.

Discussion
In this study we have shown that a progestin can induce a
direct and transient nuclear interaction between ERa and both
PR isoforms at the promoters of 2 progestin responsive protooncogenes, namely CCND1 and MYC. Moreover, this activity
can have dramatic effects on breast cancer cell proliferation
and seems to be dependent on ERa actions, as its inhibition

ing in the presence of the progestin. Thus, our results suggest
that a combined treatment with antiestrogens and antiprogestins can be beneﬁcial to breast cancer patients. As it has
previously been reported (35), the cotreatment with antiprogestins plus selective estrogen receptor modulators may have
an additive effect. Moreover, MPA-independent murine mammary carcinomas, C4-HI, respond better to a combination of
tamoxifen and mifepristone than to both single agents (36).
We conﬁrmed our observations in the murine model, using
T47D cells in which the inhibition of ERa activity resulted in a
complete blockade of MPA-dependent MYC and CCDN1 gene
transcription and cell proliferation. The fact that progestins
exerted growth inhibitory effects on MDA-MB-231 cells stably
transfected with PR (37) but stimulated cell proliferation in
models that coexpress ERa and PR (11, 12, 15, 16, 38), also
suggests that both receptors cooperate to trigger cell proliferation. In this regard, it is known that the human MYC gene

promoter contains a functional PRE that mediates the binding
of activated PR (18, 31, 39) and we also identiﬁed other
consensus PRE half sites (40) that might also bind PR (Fig.
6B). Moreover, it has recently been reported that ERE half sites
at the MYC proximal promoter (Fig. 6B) are not responsive to
estrogens (41). It may be possible that after progestin treatment, these sites might also bind ERa in complexes with PR. In
addition, we have recently shown in T47D cells that MPA
induces the binding of PR, transcription factors (TF), such as
STAT5, and nuclear tyrosine kinase receptors (RTK), such as
FGFR-2, to the same regions of the MYC promoter (18). The
results reported herein indicate that activated ERa could be
present in the same multimeric protein complexes as supported by NoShift electrophoretic mobility shift assays

(ref. 18; Fig. 7C -iii-). The regulation of human CCND1 by
progestins may be more complicated, as no canonical PRE
sites have been described in its promoter and accordingly, it
has been suggested that PR regulates CCND1 expression by
nongenomic mechanisms (7, 9, 34). The 2 models of cytoplasmic signaling pathways activated by Pg are shown in Fig.
7C. Model -i- proposes that an early interaction between ERa
and PRB is necessary for c-Src/p21Ras/Erk, PI3K/Akt, and JAK/
STAT activation (7, 8, 42); conversely, model -ii- proposes that a
polyproline motif in the amino-terminal domain of PR is
sufﬁcient to activate cell signaling pathways (9). Albeit a cytoplasmic as well as membrane localization of PR has been shown
(21), we were not able to ﬁnd PR colocalizing with ERa at these
sites. Activated growth factor receptors, usually RTKs, may

shown that PR may have genomic effects at the CCND1 promoter
(34, 44), even as a coactivator of STAT3 (26; Fig. 7C -iv-). In this
study, we showed for the ﬁrst time that PR and ERa share the

(Fig. 7C -iii-). Interestingly, we found distinct consensus PRE half
sites (40) at the CCND1 promoter (Fig. 6B), which might bind
activated PR, as shown for others genes (45, 46). Aligned with our
observations, the hypothesis that both ERa and PR can interact
at the gene promoter level has been proposed by other authors in
different contexts (44). However, this is the ﬁrst report showing
that PR and ERa are recruited to the same sites at the CCND1
and MYC promoters after PR activation by MPA. It has been

described that SRC (steroid receptor coactivator) proteins may
also participate in this response (47), but we have not yet studied
their involvement in this setting. Our results also show that
antiestrogenic concentrations of ICI ( 1 mmol/L) block the
formation of MPA-induced PR/ERa nuclear complexes, inhibiting gene transcription and cell proliferation, without affecting
the activation and binding of PR at the gene promoter. This
implicates a change in the paradigm that a rapid, nongenomic

interaction between PRB and ERa is necessary to activate the cSrc/p21ras/Erk cascade and PR by progestins. Whether the
genomic interaction described here also involves ERID domains
(8) at PR, remains to be investigated.
The expression of MYC and CCND1 constitutes an early and
transient event mediated by MPA, and it is quite conceivable
that PR/ERa complexes driven effects are required to unwind
the chromatin. This may be followed by the recruitment of
other transcription factors, and full transcription of proliferative oncogenes. In addition, this activity could also be
required for transcription events induced by other mitogens
such as epidermal growth factor (48). On the other hand, MYC
can also be involved in the activation of cyclins (D1, D2, E1, and
A2), cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4), and in the downregulation of cell-cycle inhibitors (49).
Finally, in this study we also showed that both receptors
interact in the nuclei of selected human breast cancer samples,
suggesting that ligand-independent hormone receptor activation may also be implicated in breast cancer tumor growth in
patients. Thus, it is possible to speculate that patients showing
higher levels of PR/ERa colocalization may have a better
response to a combined antiprogestin–antiestrogen therapy.
