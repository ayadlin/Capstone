ABSTRACT
The truncated somatostatin receptor sst5TMD4 is associated with poor prognosis
in breast cancer and increases breast cancer cell malignancy. Here, we examined the
cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying this association, aiming to identify new
molecular tools to improve diagnosis, prognosis or therapy. A gene expression array
comparing sst5TMD4 stably-transfected MCF-7 cells and their controls (empty-plasmid)
revealed the existence of profound alterations in the expression of genes involved in
key tumoral processes, such as cell survival or angiogenesis. Moreover, sst5TMD4overexpressing MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells demonstrated increased expression/
production of pro-angiogenic factors and enhanced capacity to form mammospheres.
Consistently, sst5TMD4-expressing MCF-7 cells induced xenografted tumors with higher
VEGF levels and elevated number of blood vessels. Importantly, sst5TMD4 was expressed
in a subset of breast cancers, where it correlated with angiogenic markers, lymphatic
metastasis, and reduced disease-free survival. These results, coupled to our previous
data, support a relevant role of sst5TMD4 in the angiogenic process and reinforce the role
of sst5TMD4 in breast cancer malignancy and metastatic potential, supporting its possible
utility to develop new molecular biomarkers and drug therapies for these tumors.

that most cancers share a group of common hallmarks
such as sustained proliferative signaling, evasion of
growth suppressors, resistance to cell death, replicative
immortality, angiogenesis, activation of invasion and
metastasis, genome instability, inflammation, altered
energy metabolism and evasion to immune destruction
[2, 3]. More recently, it has been suggested the existence
of additional common hallmark shared by all the
tumoral pathologies as is the case of altered alternative
splicing processes [4]. Indeed, recent studies point out
that intratumoral heterogeneity in outcome and cancer
survival can be explained, at least in part, by genetic
variations (such as splicing variants) present in the
primary tumor [5].
In line with this, our group has recently identified a
new truncated variant of the somatostatin receptor subtype
5, sst5TMD4, which is derived from a non-canonical
splicing process [6], and is associated with the progression
and/or malignancy of several endocrine-related tumors
[6-12]. This truncated receptor was initially identified and
characterized in pituitary adenomas [6], where its presence
is associated to more aggressive features [8], and a poorer
response to the classical medical therapy in this pathology,
the somatostatin analogues [12]. Similarly, sst5TMD4 was
also found to be overexpressed in poorly differentiated
thyroid cancers, where it may explain the lack of response
to somatostatin analogue treatment [9]. Most notably,
sst5TMD4 presence was correlated with a worse prognosis
in a group of breast cancers, and its overexpression was
associated with increased malignant features in cell lines
derived from breast tumors (MCF-7) [10]. Taken together,
these results demonstrate a relevant role of the truncated
receptor sst5TMD4 in several endocrine-related tumor
pathologies wherein somatostatin or its analogs could be
playing a regulatory role [11].
Based on these previous results, this study was
aimed to attain a further understanding of the cellular
and molecular mechanisms underlying the association
between sst5TMD4 and bad prognosis and malignancy
in breast cancer, with the ultimate goal of identifying
new molecular targets with potential utility as
biomarkers to improve diagnosis, predict prognosis or
develop novel therapies in these tumors. To pursue this
goal, we determined the gene expression microarray
profiling of sst5TMD4-overexpressing MCF-7 cells,
which, after functional enrichment analysis, revealed
that several modified genes were tightly related, among
other biological functions, to angiogenic process.
Accordingly, we employed several relevant models,
including in vitro cell lines, xenografted tumors and
human breast cancer samples, to explore the association
between the presence of the truncated receptor
sst5TMD4 and the angiogenic process, as well as the
possible relationship between this truncated receptor
and relevant clinical features of the breast cancer
patients.

sst5TMD4 overexpression alters the expression
of angiogenesis-related genes in MCF-7 cells
A gene expression microarray comparing
sst5TMD4-transfected MCF-7 cells with mock-transfected
MCF-7 cells revealed an elevated number of genes
altered by sst5TMD4 overexpression (38% up-regulated
and 62% down-regulated) (Supplementary Table S1).
Indeed, a software-driven functional-enrichment analysis
of these data indicated that sst5TMD4 overexpression
in MCF-7 alters the expression of numerous genes
involved in relevant cellular processes such as epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (10% of altered genes
with known function), cell growth (6%), cell metabolism
(6%), signal transduction (13%), or, notably, angiogenesis
(13%) (Figure 1A). Consistent with this analysis, it was
previously demonstrated that sst5TMD4 overexpression
could alter cell growth and EMT, among other tumorassociated processes [10]. Conversely, its putative
implication in the angiogenic process has not been
explored hitherto. In support of the interest of exploring
this issue, a user-driven functional-enrichment analysis
of the data generated revealed that 31 out of 78 genes
with known function (40%) significantly altered by the
presence of sst5TMD4 were associated to the angiogenic
process, based on the previous literature (Figure 1B and
Supplementary Table S1). Further validation, by qPCR,
of the genes that were altered in the gene expression
microarray, confirmed the regulation of several
angiogenesis-related genes in sst5TMD4-overexpressing
MCF-7 cells, including the overexpression of ITGB2 or
IGFBP1 (Figure 1C).

sst5TMD4 increases the production of
pro-angiogenic factors and the capacity
to form mammospheres in MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231 cells
In that the angiogenic process is driven by the
expression and secretion of pro-angiogenic factors,
the expression of the most relevant growth factors with
angiogenic activity was determined in sst5TMD4expressing cells. In particular, sst5TMD4-transfected
cells showed elevated levels of VEGF (p<0.05), EGF
(p<0.05) and Ang1 (p<0.001), with no changes in Ang2
expression, compared with mock-transfected cells (Figure
1D). However, this elevation in the expression of proangiogenic factors was not accompanied by an increase
in the expression of hypoxia-induced genes such as HIF1a or HIF-1b (Figure 1D), whose elevation generally
precedes those of the pro-angiogenic factors. Nevertheless,
changes in protein expression or phosphorylation of
these proteins cannot be ruled out. Consistent with these
results, ELISA measurements revealed higher levels

of secreted VEGF in culture medium from sst5TMD4transfected cells compared to mock controls (Figure 1E),
supporting the implication of sst5TMD4 in the elevated
expression and secretion of angiogenic factors in MCF-7
cells. Since angiogenesis in tumors seems to significantly
derive from cancer stem-like cells (CSC)-secreted proangiogenic factors [13-15], we aimed to determine the
capacity of sst5TMD4-overexpressing MCF-7 cells to
form mammospheres in low-adherence surfaces. This
demonstrated that the presence of sst5TMD4 not only
enhances the production of pro-angiogenic factors,
but also increases the population of CSCs (Figure 1F),
suggesting a role in maintaining the population of CSCs
in breast cancer. Remarkably, the most relevant changes
observed in MCF-7 were reproduced in an additional
breast cancer cell model, the MDA-MB-231 cell line.
Indeed, sst5TMD4-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells
showed significantly elevated levels of two of the main
pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF and EGF) and higher
capacity to form mammospheres (Supplementary Figure
S1), confirming the role of the truncated sst5TMD4
receptors in the angiogenic process.

order to further analyze the putative association between
sst5TMD4 presence and angiogenic markers and clinical
data (Figure 3). This analysis revealed a clear association
between the expression levels of the truncated receptor
sst5TMD4 and the expression of two of the most potent
pro-angiogenic factors (VEGF and Ang1) and one of the
most clinically-relevant angiogenic markers (CD34), as
the group of high-sst5TMD4 expressing tumors presented
higher average levels of VEGF (p<0.05), Ang1 (p<0,01)
and a clear tendency also in CD34 (p=0.068) (Figure
3A). Additionally, as might be expected, sst5TMD4
expression was directly correlated with the expression of
these angiogenic markers in the whole battery of breast
cancer samples (Figure 3B), supporting a clear association
between sst5TMD4 expression and the angiogenic
process. Moreover, the presence of the truncated receptor
sst5TMD4 was also linked to a greater probability to
develop metastasis, in that a high proportion of the breast
cancers that underwent lymphatic metastasis presented
high sst5TMD4 expression [p=0.021], and a similar,
non-significant tendency was found for distant metastasis
[p=0.092] (Figure 3C and Supplementary Table S2). More
importantly, sst5TMD4 expression was also associated
to disease-free survival in breast cancer patients, since
patients with high sst5TMD4 expression exhibited
a markedly lower disease-free survival (p=0.015)
(Figure 3D).
To further validate the association of truncated
sst5TMD4 receptor with breast cancer aggressiveness,
sst5TMD4 presence by immunohistochemistry was
determined in these breast cancer samples using a TMA as
described in Material and Methods. Representative images
of some samples are shown in Figure 4A. Presence and
expression of the sst5TMD4 receptor at the mRNA and
protein levels were comparable [p=0.043] (Figure 4B and
Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, higher expression
of sst5TMD4 at the protein level was also associated
with CD34 positive tumors (p<0.001), with lymphatic
metastasis (p=0.035) and with disease-free survival
(p=0.058) (Figure 4C and Supplementary Table S2).

sst5TMD4 increases VEGF production and
angiogenic features in an in vivo xenograft model
In order to confirm a relevant association between
the expression of the truncated receptor and the
angiogenic process in a preclinical model, we analyzed
the expression of pro-angiogenic factors in xenograft
tumors generated by the inoculation of sst5TMD4overexpressing MCF-7 cells in nude mice, as compared
to mock transfected cells [10]. Consistent with the
results obtained in vitro, these in vivo xenografted
tumors induced by sst5TMD4-transfected cells (Figure
2A) showed elevated VEGF and EGF expression levels
(by qPCR; Figure 2B) and increased VEGF protein
(detected by western-blot and immunohistofluorescence),
as compared to tumors generated by the inoculation of
mock-transfected cells (Figure 2B-2D). In addition,
according with these results, tumors induced by
sst5TMD4-overexpressing MCF-7 cells exhibited a
clearly distinct phenotype, with significantly increased
number of blood vessels per field (p<0.05, Figure 2E).

DISCUSSION
Malignant tumors are characterized by the clonal
expansion of genetically abnormal cells exhibiting
uncontrolled proliferation, failure to respond to
homeostatic signals, invasion of adjacent tissues, and
metastasis [3]. Angiogenesis plays a rate-limiting role
in tumor growth since, in the absence of angiogenesis,
tumors display a ‘dormant phenotype’, where cell
proliferation reaches equilibrium with death [16]. Under
certain conditions, tumor cells can secrete excessive
proangiogenic factors that stimulate the sprouting of new
vessels [17]. When the angiogenic process is turned on,
the tumor subsequently grows and becomes more likely
to metastasize [3]. Multiple growth factor pathways

angiogenic markers, lymphatic metastasis and

In order to explore the putative clinical consequences
of sst5TMD4 presence, expression of this truncated
receptor was determined by qPCR in a battery of 117

were categorized as low- or high-sst5TMD4 expression

participate in this intricate process to regulate the growth
and maintenance of blood vessels; among them, VEGF,
EGF and angiopoietins (Ang1, Ang2) are particularly
important [18-20]. Hence, angiogenesis is a critical
process for tumor growth and invasion and has become a
promising target in cancer therapy.

Somatostatin and its analogues (SSAs) have been
shown to tightly control the angiogenic process. Indeed,
SSAs were reported to reduce vascular cell proliferation
[21] and to prevent hypoxia-induced changes in
VEGF/VEGFRs system in vascular cells [22], likely
through the sst1 and/or sst4 receptors [22]. In addition,

somatostatin and SSAs inhibit the angiogenic process
in several models of retinal angiogenesis, likely acting
through the sst2 receptor [23, 24]. Thus, and although
much less is known about their role in tumoral cells, it
seems that somatostatin and SSAs can reduce VEGF
production from some types of tumoral cells such as
gliomas [25], gastric carcinomas [26] or pancreatic
cancer [27-29], acting through the sst2 receptor subtype
[27-29]. Consistent with a role of somatostatin and its
receptors in reducing the angiogenic process by acting
at both, the endothelial cells and the tumoral cells levels
[30], the use of SSAs in clinical trials has revealed that
somatostatin could exert its anti-vasculogenesis effect by
downregulating the serum VEGFs and, therefore, can be
used as an important adjuvant to improve the survival of
gastric cancer patients [26].

However, despite the fact that somatostatin receptors
are densely expressed in breast cancer samples compared
with normal tissues [31], being the sst2 subtype the
most frequently and abundantly expressed in tumor cells
[32], the clinical studies reporting treatment of breast
cancer patients with SSAs have only demonstrated a
limited success [33]. In this scenario, we have recently
demonstrated that the presence of the truncated receptor
sst5TMD4 correlates with a worse prognosis in a group
of breast cancer tumors, and its overexpression is
associated with increased malignant features such as
invasion and proliferation abilities (both in cell cultures
and nude mice) in breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 [10].
This was likely mediated by sst5TMD4-induced increase
in phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Akt levels, which also led
to mesenchymal-like phenotype. At the same time, this

cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been proposed to be
the fundamental driving force of tumor development,
initiation of invasion and metastasis [38]. Interestingly, as
pointed earlier, the presence of the truncated sst5TMD4
receptors could induce an enrichment of the CSC-like
population, as suggested by the enhanced capacity of
sst5TMD4-expressing cells to form mammospheres in
vitro, which supports that sst5TMD4 would be involved in
several processes required for tumor progression, invasion,
and, ultimately, metastasis. As such, sst5TMD4 has been
found to be expressed at moderate or high levels in a
representative proportion (approximately 40%) of samples
from a cohort of 117 grade 3 IDC, which is consistent
with that previously published wherein sst5TMD4 was
detected in 28% of 49 breast cancer samples from a closed
random series of tumor breast samples classified as poorly
differentiated grade 3 (G3) tumors [10]. In this new series
of human IDC samples, sst5TMD4 presence/expression
is associated to a higher expression of several angiogenic
markers (VEGF, ANG1 or CD34) and to an elevated
capacity of the tumors to metastasize, mainly to lymph
nodes, suggesting that sst5TMD4 enhances the risk of
lymphatic metastasis. And, most importantly, sst5TMD4
presence/expression is associated with lower disease-free
survival of patients, clearly reinforcing the notion that
sst5TMD4 is involved in breast cancer malignancy and
progression.
Thus, these results demonstrate that the mere
presence of the truncated receptor sst5TMD4, which
is overexpressed in a subset of breast cancer samples
(herein and [10]), can directly or indirectly contribute to
increase the capacity of the breast cancer cells to produce
pro-angiogenic factors, thereby promoting the sprouting
of new vessels, and facilitating tumor growth, which, in
turn, makes them more prone to invade and metastasize.
Consequently, when taken together, these and our previous
discoveries support the notion that the presence/expression
of the truncated receptor sst5TMD4 should be considered
a risk factor for breast cancer progression, and therefore,
that it could be used as a tool to identify novel, potentially
valuable molecular biomarkers to improve the diagnosis
and prognosis prediction for breast cancer, and as target to
develop new drug therapies in these tumors.

study demonstrated that sst5TMD4 interacts (physically
and functionally) with sst2, promoting the disruption
of somatostatin/sst2 inhibitory feedback. In the present
study, we demonstrate that the presence of the sst5TMD4
[6-12] induces significant changes in the expression of
several angiogenesis-related genes and increases the
expression and/or secretion of pro-angiogenic factors
such as VEGF, EGF and/or angiopoietins in the breast
cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, where it also
increases the capacity to form mammospheres in culture.
Moreover, sst5TMD4 induces the expression of relevant
pro-angiogenic factors in a breast cancer xenografts
model derived from this cell line, which translated into
an increased number of blood vessels in the tumors. Of
note, our previous results provide a plausible basis for
the findings shown herein in that sst5TMD4 could be
inducing VEGF expression/secretion through a direct
(increasing phosphorylated ERK and Akt levels [34])
and/or an indirect mechanism (disrupting the inhibitory
loop established between somatostatin and the sst2 [22,
23, 28,29]). Interestingly, the expression array indicated
that the changes in VEGF expression/secretion were
accompanied by changes in the expression of some of its
receptors (i.e. NRP2), which could indicate the existence of
an autocrine/paracrine loop in sst5TMD4-overexpressing
cells; but, surprisingly, were not accompanied by changes
in the expression of HIF-1a and HIF-1b, which suggest
that these factors are more likely regulated at the protein
level (amount and/or phosphorylation status) or that
sst5TMD4 increases VEGF expression through an HIFindependent mechanism [35].
More importantly, the stimulatory role of sst5TMD4
on the production of pro-angiogenic factors from MCF7 cells was accompanied by functional alterations in
MCF-7 induced tumor xenografts. In particular, we
have previously reported that sst5TMD4 overexpressing
MCF-7 cells induce the formation of bigger xenograph
tumors with a more undifferentiated phenotype [10]. In
the present study, we expand those previous observations
demonstrating that the presence of the sst5TMD4 receptor
is associated with elevated production of pro-angiogenic
factors (VEGF or EGF). Although we cannot rule out the
possibility that other cell types present in the tumor could
be contributing to these elevated levels of pro-angiogenic
factors, the fact is that sst5TMD4-overexpressing cells
induce tumors with higher number of blood vessels in the
tumor, supporting its relevant role in tumoral angiogenic
processes.
Angiogenesis is a crucial step for tumor growth
and metastasis; however, tumor progression towards
metastasis is a complex, multistage process, which is
classically simplified as local invasion, intravasation,
survival in the circulation, extravasation, and colonization
[36]. Notwithstanding this, only about 0.2% of the tumor
cells can effectively induce angiogenesis and eventually
form metastases in distant organs [37]. In this context,

Breast cancer samples
The present study was performed using a total of
117 infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma (IDC) tumors
obtained from the archives of the Pathology Department
of MD Anderson Cancer Center, Madrid (Spain) and
initially described at Moreno-Bueno et al. [39]. All tumors
were grade 3. Patients underwent surgery between 2003
and 2004. The mean patient age at surgery was 54.9
years (range, 27 to 79 years). According to the TNM

Classification staging, 48 of the tumors were stage I, 34
were stage II, and 35 were stage III-IV. Two different
tumor areas from each sample were included into a
tissue microarray (TMA) according to manufacturer’s
procedures. Histological and immunohistochemical studies
were all carried out on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tissue samples. Clinical data of the tumor sample are
provided in Supplementary Table S3. This study was
performed following standard ethical procedures of
the Spanish regulation (Ley de Investigación Orgánica
Biomédica, 14 July 2007) and was approved by the ethic
committee of MD Anderson Cancer Center, Madrid,
Spain.

MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines
(ATCC, Barcelona, Spain) were validated by analysis
of STRs (GenePrint® 10 System, Promega, Barcelona,
Spain) and checked for mycoplasma contamination by
PCR as previously reported [40]. Cells were maintained
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Sigma, San
Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
1% antibiotic-antimycotic and 2mM L-glutamine, in a
constant atmosphere with 37ºC and 5% CO2. sst5TMD4

(empty pCDNA3.1 plasmid transfected cells) have been
previously generated and validated [10].

(Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, NC, USA), and
subsequently retro-transcribed using random hexamer
primers and cDNA First Strand Synthesis kit (MRI
Fermentas, Hanover, MD, USA). Complementary DNA
derived from cell lines, xenografted tumors and breast
cancer samples were amplified by quantitative real-time
PCR (qPCR), where samples were run, in the same plate,
against a standard curve to estimate mRNA copy number
(1, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, and 106 copies of synthetic
cDNA template for each transcript) and a No-RT sample
as a negative control. qPCR was performed using Brilliant
II SYBR Green Master Mix in the Stratagene Mx3000p
instrument (both from Agilent, La Jolla, CA, USA) as
previously described [42-44]. Thermal profile consisted of
a initial step at 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles
of denaturation (95°C for 30 seconds), annealing (61°C
for 1 minute), and extension (72°C for 30 seconds); and
finally, a dissociation cycle to verify that only one product
was amplified. To control for variations in the amount of
RNA used and the efficiency of the reverse-transcription
reaction and, the expression level (copy number) of each
transcript was adjusted by ACTB expression levels. It
should be noted that, as previously reported [43, 44] and
based on the stringent criteria to maximize specificity
and efficiency, the qPCR technique, as applied, can be
used to accurately quantify copy numbers for all human
transcripts included in this study (see list of primers used
in Supplementary Table S4).

or formalin-fixed and sectioned for histopathological
examination after hematoxylin-eosin staining as
previously described [10].

Microarray experiments were performed using
Human Whole Genome array V2 4*44K array G4845A
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Four
independent passages from stably-transfected sst5TMD4pCDNA3.1 and empty-pCDNA3.1 vector, used as control
(mock), MFC7 cells were used. Total RNA from cell lines
was isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies) as
indicated by the manufacturer. Purity of isolated RNA
was evaluated spectrophotometrically by the A260/A280
absorbance ratio. RNA was labeled and array hybridized
using the Low RNA Linear Amplification Kit and the
In Situ Hybridization Kit Plus (Agilent technologies),
respectively, following manufacturer’s protocol. After
hybridization and washing, the slides were scanned
in an Axon GenePix Scanner (Axon Instruments)
and analyzed using Feature Extraction Software 10.0
(Agilent technologies). RNA samples from independent
sst5TMD4-stably transfected cells were labeled with Cy5dUTP and equal concentration of each RNA from mock
control cells were labeled with Cy3-dUTP. Differentially
expressed genes in sst5TMD4-transfected MCF-7 cells vs.
control (mock) cells were identified with GEPAS (Gene
Expression Pattern Analysis Suite, http://gepas3.bioinfo.
cipf.es) selecting genes with a fold difference of at least
two in all of the samples and standard deviation lower than
0,5. Functional enrichment analysis was performed using

Cell lines

RNA extraction, reverse transcription and qPCR
RNA extraction, quantification, reverse-transcription
as well as the development, validation and application of
qPCR to measure the expression levels of different human
transcripts have been previously reported elsewhere by our
group [41-45]. Total RNA was extracted from paraffinembedded breast cancer samples, frozen xenografted
tumors and cell lines using Trizol (Life Technologies,
Barcelona, Spain) following the manufacturer’s protocol
and subsequently treated with DNase (Promega,
Barcelona, Spain). Total RNA concentration and purity
was assessed using Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer

standard procedures [10]. Specifically, a tumoral piece
was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. After antigenretrieval, sections were incubated with a specific antihuman VEGF antibody (AB-293-NA; R&D systems) and
the appropriate fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody
(Donkey Anti-Goat IgG Alexa Fluor 488; ab150129;
Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Signal intensity was determined
using the ImageJ software [47].
sst5TMD4 and CD34 immunohistochemical
staining of the human breast cancer samples was
performed by the LSAB (Dako) method with a heatinduced antigen retrieval step. Briefly, sections were
immersed in boiling 10mM sodium citrate at pH 6.0 for
3 min in a pressure cooker. Rabbit polyclonal antisera
against human sst5TMD4 previously described [6, 10]
and monoclonal mouse Anti-Human CD34 Class II (Clone
QBEnd 10, Dako) were used as primary antibodies, and
goat anti-rabbit (ThermoScientific, Barcelona, Spain)
and rabbit anti-mouse (ThermoScientific) as secondary
antibodies. The antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilutions.
The primary antibodies were omitted in the negative
controls. sst5TMD4 staining were categorized as low or
high expression refers to the normal sst5TMD4 staining.
CD34 staining was categorized as low or high with respect
to normal mammary tissue.

VEGF determination by ELISA
VEGF concentration in the sst5TMD4- and mocktransfected MCF-7 culture media was determined using
a commercial human VEGF ELISA kit (VEGF human
ELISA kit; Cat. number: KHG0112; Life Technologies),
following the manufacturer’s instructions. The information
regarding specificity, detectability and reproducibility for
the assay can be accessed at the company website.

Mammosphere formation assay
Mammosphere formation assays were developed
following previously published protocols [46]. Briefly,
10.000 sst5TMD4- and mock-transfected MCF-7 or MDAMB-231 cells were seeded (in triplicate) in 6-well plates
pretreated with Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) in
2ml DMEM/F12 without phenol red. Culture media was
supplemented with recombinant epithelial growth factor,
B27 supplement and Gentamicin/Amphotericin B. After
seven days of incubation at 37ºC, 5%CO2, the number of
mammospheres was counted using an inverted microscope.

Determination of blood vessels in the
xenografted tumors

Western blotting
Xenografted tumors were processed for the detection
of sst5TMD4 and VEGF by western blot using standard
procedures [10]. Specifically, proteins were extracted from
a tumoral piece using pre-warmed SDS-DTT sample buffer
(62,5mM Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 20% glicerol, 100mM DTT
and 0,005% bromophenol blue) followed by sonication
for 10 sec and boiling for 5 min at 95º C. Proteins were
separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5%
non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline/0.05% Tween 20
and incubated with the rabbit polyclonal antisera against
human sst5TMD4 previously described [6, 10] or the
specific goat anti-human VEGF antibody (AB-293-NA;
R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and the appropriate
secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit or anti-goat IgG-HRP;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). Proteins
were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence
detection system (GE Healthcare, Madrid, Spain) with dyed
molecular weight markers. A densitometric analysis of the
bands was carried out with ImageJ software [47] using total
protein loading (Ponceau staining) as normalizing factor as
previously reported elsewere [48].

Xenografted tumors were processed for the
quantification of blood vessel density using a standard
histopathological procedure [49]. Specifically, a tumor
piece was formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded followed
by haematoxylin and eosin staining. Vascular density was
determined by counting the number of visible vessels per
20x objective tumor-full fields from a minimum of 5 fields
per each of the 4-5 animals per genotype.

Statistical analysis
For in vitro experiments, data are expressed as
mean ± SEM obtained from, at least, three separate,
independent experiments carried out in different days and
with different cell preparations. Statistical analysis was
carried out using Student’s t-test. For in vivo xenografts
experiments, data are expressed as mean ± SEM obtained
from n=4-5 animals. Statistical analysis was carried out
using Student’s t-test. For the analysis of human breast
carcinoma data, samples were categorized in low and
high sst5TMD4 levels according to median sst5TMD4
expression levels. Differences in the expression of
angiogenic markers between both groups were assessed
by Student’s t-test. Correlations between the expression
of sst5TMD4 and angiogenic markers was assessed by
Pearson´s correlation test. Significant correlations between
categorized sst5TMD4 mRNA/protein expression, CD34
IHC expression, presence of metastasis and disease-free
