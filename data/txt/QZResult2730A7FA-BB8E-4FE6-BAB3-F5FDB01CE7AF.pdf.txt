Abstract
A major challenge in the clinical use of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics is maximizing efﬁcacy in tumors while
sparing normal tissue. Irinotecan is used for colorectal cancer treatment but the extent of its use is limited by toxic
side effects. Liposomal delivery systems offer tools to modify pharmacokinetic and safety proﬁles of cytotoxic
drugs. In this study, we deﬁned parameters that maximize the antitumor activity of a nanoliposomal formulation
of irinotecan (nal-IRI). In a mouse xenograft model of human colon carcinoma, nal-IRI dosing could achieve higher
intratumoral levels of the prodrug irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 compared with free irinotecan. For
example, nal-IRI administered at doses 5-fold lower than free irinotecan achieved similar intratumoral exposure
of SN-38 but with superior antitumor activity. Tumor response and pharmacokinetic modeling identiﬁed the
duration for which concentrations of SN-38 persisted above a critical intratumoral threshold of 120 nmol/L as
determinant for antitumor activity. We identiﬁed tumor permeability and carboxylesterase activity needed for
prodrug activation as critical factors in achieving longer duration of SN-38 in tumors. Simulations varying tumor
permeability and carboxylesterase activity predicted a concave increase in tumor SN-38 duration, which was
conﬁrmed experimentally in 13 tumor xenograft models. Tumors in which higher SN-38 duration was achieved
displayed more robust growth inhibition compared with tumors with lower SN-38 duration, conﬁrming the
importance of this factor in drug response. Overall, our work shows how liposomal encapsulation of irinotecan can
safely improve its antitumor activity in preclinical models by enhancing accumulation of its active metabolite
within the tumor microenvironment. Cancer Res; 74(23); 7003–13. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Liposomal carriers have become clinically accepted in cancer therapy as delivery systems that can enhance the utility of
existing anticancer drugs (1). The potential beneﬁts of these
macromolecular carriers include overcoming solubility issues
for certain drug classes, protecting the drug from unwanted
metabolism and extending the residence time in plasma and
tissue. In particular, liposomes tend to preferentially accumulate in tumors as a result of an enhanced permeability and
retention (EPR) effect. The EPR effect is attributed to the
abnormal tumor vasculature permitting extravasation of
macromolecules, as well as impaired lymphatic drainage that
promote the retention of these molecules within the tumor
microenvironment, thereby providing sustained release at the
tumor site mimicking a metronomic dosing (2). Increased

tumor deposition via the EPR effect may also prevent drug
resistance by overcoming the activity of multidrug resistant
proteins (3, 4) and may offer possible means of improving
safety aspects by reducing systemic exposure relative to tumor
exposure (5). There are potential pharmacologic advantages of
the EPR effect, particularly for antineoplastic agents that have
to engage their target over a longer time period or have little
binding activity; for example drugs of the camptothecin class
with topoisomerase 1 enzyme (TOP1) as the primary target.
Irinotecan (CPT-11), a clinically approved camptothecin, is a
prodrug that is activated by carboxylesterase (CES) enzymes,
present primarily in liver and colon tissue to the active form,
SN-38. (In the article, CPT-11 is used when referring to the
prodrug levels in plasma or tumor samples following either free
irinotecan or nal-IRI administration. SN-38 is used when
referring to the active metabolite of CPT-11.) The active SN38 can be subsequently inactivated through glucuronidation by
members of the UDP glucuronosyltransferase family (6). The
principal mechanism of action leading to cell death is through
DNA damage after replication-fork collisions with transient
drug-TOP1 cleavage complexes, thus emphasizing the time of
drug exposure as important driver for cytotoxicity of camptothecins (7, 8). Recently, we described the development of a
novel nanoliposomal formulation of irinotecan, nanoliposomal
formulation of irinotecan (nal-IRI; also known as MM-398 or
PEP02; ref. 9). nal-IRI features very high drug loading efﬁciency,
a high drug payload, and marked in vivo drug retention that

also stabilizes the active lactone conﬁguration of irinotecan.
The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of the encapsulated
irinotecan were dramatically altered in the plasma of female
rats, with a 344 increase in the area under the curve (AUC), an
8.5 decrease in the volume of distribution, and a 39.6
increase in the half-life of the total drug. Pharmacokinetic
analysis in a clinical study conﬁrmed these performance
characteristics of nal-IRI in patients (10).
Plasma drug concentrations cannot readily be translated
into therapeutic effect; a sufﬁcient amount of active therapeutic agent must be transported to the tumor site of action (i.e., be
available for uptake by cancer cells) to observe favorable drug
activity (11). The transport of macromolecules across the
tumor vasculature is a complex process depending on vessel
perfusion, surface area, and permeability, as well as tumor and
drug characteristics. Several studies have used mathematical
models to understand liposomal drug delivery within solid
tumors (12, 13). Of particular interest is work done by Hendriks
and colleagues (14), where the authors constructed a computational model to describe the parameters that affect the tumor
delivery of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, the ﬁrst liposomal
anticancer agent to receive clinical approval. The study
concluded that liposome PK and tumor permeability to liposomes (tumor deposition) were the most important parameters controlling liposomal drug delivery to tumors.
In the case of nal-IRI, the complex metabolism (15) and
mechanism of action (8, 16) of free irinotecan, in addition to
the above-mentioned parameters, may play a role in the
overall liposomal irinotecan delivery within tumors. In this
study, we describe a systems pharmacology approach to
identify critical parameters that differentiate nal-IRI from
free irinotecan with regard to in vivo activity. A mechanistic
tumor PK model was developed and trained to describe
CPT-11 and SN-38 levels observed in plasma and tumor,
following administration of either nal-IRI or free irinotecan
in tumor xenografts. A model sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the critical parameters driving in vivo
activity, which were then experimentally conﬁrmed by measuring these factors in multiple cell line and patient-derived
xenograft models. The ﬁndings in this study highlight critical
parameters that could serve as potential biomarkers to
identify cancer indications and patient populations with an
increased likelihood of naI-IRI responsiveness.

Materials and Methods

500 g drug/mol phospholipid, and extrusion through 0.1 mm
polycarbonate ﬁlters. The resulting preparations displayed a
particle size of 111 nm (with polydispersity index of 0.04),
and a drug load of 473 mg irinotecan-HCl/mmol phospholipid. All lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.
Irinotecan hydrochloride was purchased from the pharmacy.
Acetic acid, methanol, and acetonitrile were from EMD

Cell culture
Cell lines [HT-29 (colon), SK-ES-1 (Ewing's sarcoma), A549
(lung), LoVo (colon), MDA-MB-231 (breast)] were obtained
from the ATCC, whereas A2780 cells (ovarian) was obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells from the ATCC and Sigma were
received in 2010. All cells were authenticated before receipt and
were propagated for less than 6 months after resuscitation.
Cultures are regularly tested for Mycoplasma. All cell lines were
cultured in humidiﬁed CO2 atmosphere at 37 C using media
recommended by the manufacturer.
Pharmacokinetic and tissue biodistribution study
Five-week-old female NOD/SCID mice were purchased from
Charles River Laboratory. The care and treatment of experimental animals were in accordance with the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Subcutaneous
tumors were established by injecting 10 million HT-29 cells
into the right ﬂank of mice. When the average tumor volume
reached approximately 200 mm3, mice were randomized into
groups (n ¼ 4/time point) that received a single intravenous
(i.v.) dose of nal-IRI at 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg. Following 1, 4, 8,
24, 48, 72, and 168 hours after a single dose, mice were
sacriﬁced and perfused with PBS before harvest of tumor
and other normal tissues.
Antitumor activity studies
Five-week-old female NOD/SCID mice were purchased from
Charles River Laboratory. Subcutaneous tumors were established by injecting 10 million HT-29 and SK-ES-1 cells or 5
million A549 cells into the right ﬂank of mice. Tumor growth
was measured twice per week by calipers and calculated with
formula: width2  length  0.52. When the average tumor
volume reached approximately 200 mm3, mice were randomized into treatment groups (n ¼ 5–8/group) that received
weekly i.v. dose of PBS (control), free irinotecan (50 mg/kg),
or nal-IRI at various doses ranging from 1.25 to 20 mg/kg.

average tumor volume reached approximately 300 mm3, mice
were randomized into treatment groups (n ¼ 4/group) that
received single i.v. dose of either PBS or nal-IRI at 10 mg/kg.
Before tumor collection, intracardial perfusion was performed to remove the blood components from the tumor
compartment. Brieﬂy, a butterﬂy needle (23G) connected to
a 10-mL syringe ﬁlled with PBS is inserted into the left
ventricle. Inferior vena cava is cut and animal is perfused
with 10-mL PBS (within 1–2 minutes). The control tumors
were harvested 24 hours after PBS administration and used
for the irinotecan activation assay, whereas the treated
tumors were harvested either 24 or 72 hours following
nal-IRI treatment and used for high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) analysis.
HPLC quantiﬁcation of CPT-11 and SN-38
Tumor and normal tissues were analyzed for CPT-11 and
SN-38 concentrations using a modiﬁcation of the method
previously described (9). Brieﬂy, tissues were weighed and
homogenized for 2 minutes in 20% w/v water using a TissueLyser (Qiagen). The homogenates were extracted by mixing 0.1
mL homogenate with 0.9 mL 1% acetic acid/methanol followed
by 10 seconds vortexing and placing at 80 C for 1 hour. The
samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 minutes at room
temperature and supernatants collected for HPLC analysis
(Dionex). The samples and standards (CPT-11 and SN-38)
were analyzed using a C18 reverse phase column (Synergi
Polar-RP 80A 250  4.60 mm 4 mm column). The drug metabolites were eluted running a gradient from 30% acetonitrile;
70% 0.1% TFA/H2O to 68% acetonitrile; 32% 0.1% TFA/H2O
during a 13 minutes span at a ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The

initial elute composition was restored after 14 minutes and
continued for 6 minutes before the next injection. The CPT-11
peak was detected at approximately 7.7 minutes and the SN-38
peak eluted at approximately 8.4 minutes, using an in-line
ﬂuorescence detector excited at 372 nm and emitting at
556 nm.
Irinotecan activation assay
Tumor tissue lysates were prepared by homogenizing the
tissue in 6% w/v 0.1 M Tris HCL/1% Triton X-100 solution
(pH7.5) using a TissueLyser for 2 to 4 minutes. Protein concentration of lysates was measured using the BCA reagent
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). Lysates (250 mg of protein) were mixed
with an equal volume of 10 mmol/L irinotecan and incubated at
37 C. Following 24 hours of incubation the reaction was
terminated by adding an equal volume of 1% acetic acid/
methanol and samples centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatant was processed for HPLC quantiﬁcation
of CPT-11 and SN-38 as described above.
Statistical analysis
The statistical signiﬁcance of differences between groups
was analyzed with the one-way ANOVA test. Results were
considered statistically signiﬁcant at P < 0.05. The analysis
was performed using GraphPad Prism 6.01.
Model development and simulation
Pharmacokinetic proﬁles of metabolites in plasma and
tumor from free irinotecan and nal-IRI were described by
using multi-compartmental models (Fig. 1B). The model equations are explained and summarized in the Supplementary

Results
nal-IRI displays a prolonged exposure in both plasma
and tumor compared with free irinotecan
The pharmacokinetic proﬁles of the prodrug CPT-11 and its
active metabolite SN-38 were measured in plasma and tumors
following administration of either free irinotecan or nal-IRI
(Fig. 1A). At similar doses of both free irinotecan and nal-IRI,
the CPT-11 and SN-38 plasma levels cleared rapidly from
circulation within 8 hours after free irinotecan injection,

whereas the levels of CPT-11 and SN-38 following nal-IRI
administration were persistent and remained in circulation
for over 50 hours. An approximately 10-fold higher plasma
CPT-11 peak level was observed with nal-IRI as compared with
free irinotecan. However, the plasma peak level of SN-38
achieved with nal-IRI was 10-fold lower compared with free
irinotecan, probably due to the ability of the lipid bilayer to
protect the conversion of prodrug CPT-11 to SN-38 by the
systemic CES enzyme present in mouse models (17). Administration of free irinotecan resulted in the clearance of greater
than 90% of CPT-11 from tumors within 24 hours; however,
following nal-IRI administration, CPT-11 levels persisted above

parameters (Table 1) ﬁtting the model simulations within the
standard deviations of in vivo PK proﬁles of both CPT-11 and
SN-38 (Fig. 1A). As the in vitro cytotoxic effects of irinotecan on
tumor cells is dependent on the concentration and the time of
exposure of cells to active metabolite SN-38 (7, 8), we sought to
understand if the overall plasma and tumor SN-38 exposure
predicts the in vivo activity of both nal-IRI and free irinotecan.
The trained model determined that a 5-fold higher dose of free
irinotecan (50 mg/kg) was required to achieve similar SN-38
exposure in both plasma and tumor as compared with nal-IRI
(10 mg/kg; Fig. 2A). The TGI of HT-29 xenograft model at these
equal exposure doses, was signiﬁcantly greater with nal-IRI
(110%) treatment as compared with free irinotecan (40%),
despite the 5-fold lower total dose administered ( , P < 0.05,

10,000 nmol/L levels for 168 hours. Similar peak levels of SN-38
were achieved with both free irinotecan and nal-IRI in HT-29
tumors, though a prolonged SN-38 exposure for up to 168 hours
(measured as the AUC from 0 to 168 hours) was achieved with
nal-IRI as compared with less than 48 hours tumor exposure
with free irinotecan. In summary, CPT-11 and SN-38 were still
present in tumors at 168 hours following naI-IRI administration, though both CPT-11 and SN-38 had cleared from plasma.
Tumor SN-38 duration drives in vivo activity
We developed a mechanistic PK model to identify the
determinants that may differentiate the plasma and tumor
PK proﬁles between free irinotecan and nal-IRI (Fig. 1B). The
experimental PK data were used to estimate the optimal model

one-way ANOVA test; Fig. 2B). In addition, other studies have
shown no additional HT-29 TGI at the maximum tolerated
dose of free irinotecan (100 mg/kg; ref. 18). To identify a
dose level of nal-IRI that gave comparable in vivo activity to
50 mg/kg free irinotecan, we performed a dose escalation study
in the HT-29 xenograft model (Fig. 2C). nal-IRI at 5 mg/kg
showed partial inhibition of tumor growth (40% TGI) that
was comparable with 50 mg/kg free irinotecan, whereas 10 mg/
kg and 20 mg/kg nal-IRI showed signiﬁcant ( , P < 0.05, one-way
ANOVA test) TGI compared with saline (110%–130% TGI).
Furthermore, we have previously tested control liposomes
(that have comparable composition with nal-IRI except for
the absence of irinotecan, the active pharmaceutical ingredient) and did not observe any TGI (data not shown).
The intratumor SN-38 concentrations achieved from 50 to
100 mg/kg doses of free irinotecan and 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20
mg/kg doses of nal-IRI were then simulated using the trained
mechanistic PK model (Fig. 2D). Although a nal-IRI dose of 5
mg/kg achieved similar TGI as 50 mg/kg free irinotecan, the
tumor SN-38 AUC and peak levels were approximately 2-fold
and 6-fold lower respectively for nal-IRI as compared with
free irinotecan. Furthermore, we noted at these doses both
drugs were able to maintain the tumor SN-38 concentration
above 120 nmol/L for the same duration of approximately 40
hours. To determine if the tumor SN-38 concentration
impacts in vivo activity, we used the tumor SN-38 concentration of 120 nmol/L as a threshold. We also determined the
duration for which the various doses of nal-IRI or free
irinotecan could maintain the tumor SN-38 concentration
above 120 nmol/L, hereon referred to as "tumor SN-38
duration." A sigmoidal relationship between TGI (%) and
tumor SN-38 duration (Fig. 2E) was observed for both nal-IRI
and free irinotecan (R2 ¼ 0.62). However, when comparing
TGI (%) with tumor SN-38 AUC (Fig. 2F) the relationship was

less signiﬁcant (R2 ¼ 0.45), due to the lower TGI (%) achieved
by 50 mg/kg free irinotecan compared with 10 mg/kg nal-IRI.
We also observed longer SN-38 duration in tumors (>100
hours) compared with normal tissues (<72 hours; Fig. 2G and
Supplementary Fig. S1).
Identiﬁcation of liposome tumor permeability and local
tumor activation as critical determinants for tumor
SN-38 duration
A local sensitivity analysis on the model parameters was
performed to identify processes impacting the tumor SN-38
duration (Supplementary Data). In response to the administration of free irinotecan (50 mg/kg), the tumor SN-38 duration
was relatively insensitive to most model parameters (Fig. 3A),
suggesting the inability of free irinotecan to modulate it. In
contrast, several model parameters were found to signiﬁcantly
impact tumor SN-38 duration following the administration of
nal-IRI (10 mg/kg; Fig. 3B). The sensitive parameters for nal-IRI
can be classiﬁed into three different categories: (i) PK, rate of
breakdown of liposomes in blood (Release rate in blood, Vmax,
Release,p), (ii) activation of prodrug CPT-11 to SN-38 by CES
enzyme (CES activity in tumor; Vmax,CES,t and blood; Vmax,CES,p),
and (iii) liposome uptake within tumors, that is, nal-IRI tumor
deposition (nal-IRI tumor permeability, PSnal-IRI). Among these
parameters, the release rate in plasma negatively affected
tumor SN-38 duration due to a decrease in the overall systemic
exposure of nal-IRI. CES enzyme activity, particularly from
tumor CES (local tumor activation of irinotecan) and nal-IRI
permeability (tumor deposition), positively affected the tumor
SN-38 duration. To assess the identiﬁability of parameter
estimates, log likelihood proﬁling was performed for the
sensitive parameters, Vmax,CES,t and PSnal-IRI (19). The conﬁdence intervals suggested that both parameters were precisely
estimated (Supplementary Fig. S2).

nal-IRI Activity Depends on CPT-11 Deposition and Activation

Biologic variability and simulated perturbation of
nal-IRI tumor deposition and local activation
To determine the biologic relevance of these sensitive
parameters toward driving tumor SN-38 duration (namely
nal-IRI tumor deposition and local tumor activation of irinotecan), the parameters were measured in a panel of 13 xenograft models. We used the total CPT-11 concentrations in
tumors as a surrogate for nal-IRI tumor deposition as model
simulations based on nal-IRI pharmacokinetics showed that
majority of CPT-11 in plasma and tumor was encapsulated and
protected within the liposomes and less than 10% was available
as free CPT-11 (Supplementary Fig. S3). The intratumor con-

centrations of CPT-11 varied substantially across the tumor
panel (Fig. 4A). The tumor models from cell-lines displayed
overall higher levels of prodrug CPT-11 deposition (from 5,000–
15,000 ng/g) as compared with patient-derived tumor models
(1,000–2,000 ng/g). In addition, a high degree of variability was
observed between individual tumors within the same xenograft model (66% average coefﬁcient of variation). Model
simulations were used to test the effect of altering nal-IRI
tumor deposition on tumor SN-38 duration (Fig. 4B). By
decreasing the nal-IRI permeability parameter to zero, which
simulates an impermeable tumor microenvironment, the
tumor SN-38 duration of approximately 100 hours achieved

Figure 4. In vivo variability in nal-IRI tumor deposition and local activation. A, intratumor CPT-11 concentrations were measured across cell-line–derived (HT29, SK-ES-1, A549, MDA-MB-231, LoVo, AsPC-1, and A2780) and patient-derived (CTG-0062, CTG-0079, CTG-0252, CTG-0288, CTG-0158, and
CTG-0283) tumor models. Tumor-bearing mice were administered a single i.v. dose of 10 mg/kg nal-IRI and tumors excised 24 hours later. CPT-11
concentrations were determined in the tumor lysates using HPLC analysis as described in Materials and Methods (n ¼ 4–8 tumors/model). B, the effect of nalIRI permeability on tumor SN-38 concentrations was simulated by reducing the nal-IRI permeability parameter PSnal-IRI to zero. The simulated tumor SN-38
concentrations were compared at the equal exposure doses of 10 mg/kg nal-IRI and 50 mg/kg free irinotecan. Black solid line, nal-IRI (10 mg/kg) with base

measured with HPLC analysis ( , P < 0.05; t test). D, the effect of knocking out tumor CES activity on tumor SN-38 duration was simulated by

with 10 mg/kg nal-IRI was substantially reduced to approximately 50 hours and approached the levels observed with 50
mg/kg free irinotecan. Taken together, these results suggest
that the tumor deposition of naI-IRI is highly tumor speciﬁc
and will dramatically impact tumor SN-38 duration.
To determine the degree to which local tumor activation of
irinotecan varied in human tumors, we measured CES activity
using an ex vivo assay in a panel of 80 patient-derived tumors.
The tumor lysates varied in their ability to activate prodrug
irinotecan and produce SN-38 (1–25 ng/mL SN-38 produced),
suggesting a high degree of variability in local tumor activation
of irinotecan across indications. A signiﬁcant difference in
local tumor activation of irinotecan was observed between
colon and lung tumors (P < 0.05). However, there was no
signiﬁcant difference between other indications, which may be
due to high variability observed within each indication (Fig.
4C). The impact of varying the tumor CES activity on tumor SN38 duration was evaluated by simulating a knockout of tumor
CES enzyme (Fig. 4D). In the absence of local tumor activation,
tumor SN-38 duration with nal-IRI (10 mg/kg) decreased from
approximately 100 to 40 hours, similar to that achieved by free
irinotecan (50 mg/kg).
nal-IRI tumor deposition and local activation
collectively predict tumor SN-38 duration
The relative contribution of nal-IRI tumor deposition and
local tumor activation on tumor SN-38 duration was evaluated
using model simulations. On the basis of the ﬁndings from the
sensitivity analysis (Fig. 3B), nal-IRI permeability (PSnal-IRI) and
tumor CES activity (Vmax,CES,t) values were used to create a map
relating these parameters to tumor SN-38 duration following
nal-IRI administration (Fig. 5A). Model simulations predicted a
concave relationship, where the tumor SN-38 duration is
dependent upon both the tumor permeability and the tumor
CES activity. The tumor SN-38 duration could be increased by
either increasing the PSnal-IRI or Vmax,CES,t (white arrows) and
the maximum tumor SN-38 duration of 168 hours was only

reached with CES activity at 0.025 nmol/min and tumor
permeability at 1.5E4 L/min/kg.
To experimentally test the model predictions, we used the
same panel of 13 xenograft models to measure the tumor
concentrations of CPT-11 (as a surrogate for tumor deposition,
Supplementary Fig. S4A); tumor SN-38 concentrations (as a
surrogate for tumor SN-38 duration; Supplementary Fig. S4B)
and CES activity (for local tumor activation of irinotecan). The
experimental data supported the model simulations, conﬁrming that the SN-38 concentration within tumors was dependent
on both the tumor CPT-11 concentration and tumor CES
activity (Fig 5B). All tumor models with high CPT-11 concentration >2,000 ng/mL or high CES activity > 5 ng/mL displayed
high tumor SN-38 concentrations ("red") ranging from 25 to 125
ng/mL (Supplementary Table S2). In certain tumor models,
one of the parameters contributed predominantly toward
higher SN-38 concentrations (black arrows). A2780 and SKES-1 tumors displayed high tumor SN-38 concentrations of 97
ng/mL and 127 ng/mL respectively (Supplementary Table S2),
which was mainly due to high CPT-11 concentrations (>2,000
ng/mL), whereas in other tumor models (CTG-0062 and AsPC1) the CES activity (>5 ng/mL) was the dominant factor
contributing toward high tumor SN-38 concentrations. Further
tumor models with the lowest tumor SN-38 concentrations
ranging from 5 to 12 ng/mL ("blue"), including several patientderived tumor models (boxed area) also displayed lower tumor
CPT-11 concentrations (<2,000 ng/mL) and CES enzyme activity (<5 ng/mL).
Tumor SN-38 duration correlates with nal-IRI in vivo
activity
In vivo tumor response studies were performed in three
tumor models in which different tumor SN-38 durations had
been observed (as indicated by tumor SN-38 concentration at
72 hours) to determine the impact of tumor SN-38 duration on
in vivo activity of nal-IRI. The tumor volumes observed for both
HT-29 (Fig. 6A) and SK-ES-1 (Fig. 6B) models were signiﬁcantly

lower (P < 0.05) following 10 mg/kg nal-IRI as compared with
untreated tumors. In both these models, tumor regression was
observed immediately after the ﬁrst dose and was sustained
through the course of the study. A549 tumors achieved lower
SN-38 tumor levels (Fig. 4A) and did not respond to nal-IRI
treatment (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, both A549 and HT-29 cells
displayed similar in vitro sensitivity to SN-38 with IC50 values of
53 and 44 nmol/L, respectively (20). In summary, nal-IRI
induced stronger responses (100%TGI) in tumor models that
had higher tumor SN-38 duration (>100 hours).

Discussion
The nal-IRI formulation dramatically alters the pharmacologic properties of irinotecan as well as its active metabolite,
SN-38 (9). In this study, we identiﬁed a pharmacologic parameter—namely, tumor SN-38 duration—as a driver of irinotecanbased in vivo activity and propose biomarkers that can impact
tumor SN-38 duration achieved by nal-IRI. Our study indicates
that nal-IRI can completely inhibit tumor growth compared
with free irinotecan, despite administering doses that achieve
similar SN-38 exposure (measured as the AUC). Instead, the
duration of prolonged exposure of SN-38 within tumors

www.aacrjournals.org

achieved by nal-IRI was shown to be a major pharmacologic
determinant for in vivo activity in mice.
Several studies have shown improved in vitro cytotoxic
activity of SN-38 when cells are exposed to drug for longer
duration (21). The in vitro cell doubling time for HT-29 cells is
approximately 20 hours (21), whereas in vivo the tumor volume
doubles (Fig. 2B) at a slower rate (8–9 days). In addition, at
a given time only 35 to 50% of cells are in the S-phase of cell
cycle wherein the maximum cytotoxicity of free irinotecan
has been observed (21). Thus, to exert maximum cytotoxic
effects across different cell-cycle phases, the cells have to be
exposed to free irinotecan across multiple cell cycles. Our in
vivo study conﬁrms these ﬁndings as the free irinotecan is
rapidly cleared from plasma and tumor tissue (tumor SN-38
duration of approximately 40 hours), thereby not allowing
sufﬁcient time for tumor cells to be exposed to SN-38 (for
only 2 cell-cycle doubling time) as compared with more than
5 cell-cycle doubling times with nal-IRI (tumor SN-38 duration for >100 hours). Thus the extended exposure of tumor
cells to SN-38, which is achieved by nal-IRI, can contribute
toward the enhanced cytotoxicity as compared with free
irinotecan.

We observed higher tumor concentrations of CPT-11 and
SN-38 at 168 hours following administration of nal-IRI. In
contrast, the peak plasma concentrations of SN-38 was lower
with nal-IRI as compared with free irinotecan, suggesting that
most of the CPT-11 from nal-IRI remains inside the liposomes
and is protected from systemic conversion as described with
free irinotecan (17). In addition, prolonged SN-38 duration
from nal-IRI administration was observed only in tumors and
much less in normal tissues, suggesting that toxicity might not
be exacerbated by nal-IRI treatment. The preferentially accumulation of nal-IRI in tumors as compared with normal tissues
can be attributed to the EPR effect, where the leaky vasculature
in tumor facilitates the extravasation of liposomal nanoparticles and the defective lymphatic drainage helps increase the
retention within tumor (1, 2). Thus, with the EPR effect, nal-IRI
creates a large depot of CPT-11 only in tumors thereby
prolonging tumor SN-38 duration. In contrast, free irinotecan
can easily be transported in and out of the tissues with a short
plasma half-life, resulting in minimal SN-38 duration in tumors.
The enhanced in vivo activity of nal-IRI as compared with
free irinotecan was attributed to the ability of nal-IRI to extend
the tumor SN-38 duration. Sensitivity analysis identiﬁed two
key determinants that impact the ability of nal-IRI to extend
tumor SN-38 duration—(i) nal-IRI tumor deposition, as measured by the extent of prodrug CPT-11 deposition within
tumors and (ii) nal-IRI local activation, from prodrug CPT11 to SN-38 facilitated by the local tumor CES enzyme. The
experimental data, in this study supported the importance of
each of these determinants. We observed high degree of
variability in the overall nal-IRI tumor deposition across the
13 xenograft models that were tested. Several studies have
highlighted a role for tumor permeability, tumor perfusion, and
stromal matrix in limiting the delivery of therapeutic agents
into tumors (22). In our model simulations, when the nal-IRI
tumor permeability was decreased to zero, the beneﬁt of higher
tumor SN-38 duration with nal-IRI was negatively impacted
and reduced to levels simulated for free irinotecan. We also
observed that the tumors with lower nal-IRI deposition had
considerable lower SN-38 tumor levels. These data are consistent with other ﬁndings suggesting that a dense tumor
stroma can impede drug permeability and limit drug delivery
within tumors (23, 24).
Use of tumor CES activity as a cellular parameter for predicting free irinotecan response had limited success both in
preclinical (25, 26) and clinical studies.(27). Through the
sensitivity analysis performed in this study, we identiﬁed CES
activity as a critical parameter for nal-IRI activity. Tumor
models that displayed high ability to activate CPT-11, achieved
high tumor SN-38 concentrations despite limited deposition of
CPT-11, thus suggesting the importance of local tumor CES
enzyme expression in facilitating longer SN-38 exposure following nal-IRI administration. In fact, others have shown that
in vitro and in vivo activity of free irinotecan can be enhanced
by overexpressing of CES enzyme in tumor cells (28, 29). In
addition to tumor cells expressing CES enzyme (30), other
components of the extracellular matrix such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) express CES1 enzyme and play a
role in CPT-11 activation (31). In fact, we performed in vitro

7012

Cancer Res; 74(23) December 1, 2014

studies that conﬁrmed the ability of TAMs to hydrolyze CPT-11
to SN-38 (Supplementary Fig. S5). Thus our data suggests the
extended tumor PK achieved by nal-IRI provides high local
depot of prodrug CPT-11 for prolonged time, thus allowing for
activation by tumor CES enzymes. Collectively our data provides rational for investigating tumor CES enzyme activity as a
potential marker for nal-IRI activity.
Pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamic markers such as
TOP1 have shown limited correlations with free irinotecan
response (6, 32–34). In addition to the intrinsic sensitivity of
tumor cells to SN-38, our data indicate that the duration for
which tumor cells are exposed to SN-38 (tumor SN-38 duration) also plays a critical role in driving treatment response to
irinotecan. Tumor models with extended SN-38 duration (HT29, SK-ES-1) showed robust in vivo response to nal-IRI, whereas
A549 with shorter tumor SN-38 duration did not respond to
therapy. The fact that in vitro sensitivity of both HT-29 and
A549 to SN-38 is very similar (20) corroborates the ﬁnding that
the duration of SN-38 is driving the tumor response.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that nal-IRI enhances
the pharmacokinetic proﬁle of tumor SN-38, prolonging tumor
exposure to SN-38 compared with free irinotecan, and therefore has the potential for therapeutic effect in human cancers.
Liposome permeability and CES activity were the critical
factors that emerged from model simulation of tumor SN-38
duration, which were experimentally shown to vary across and
within tumor indications. Thus, translational research exploring the utility of tumor liposome permeability and local
activation of irinotecan as biomarkers for nal-IRI clinical
activity is warranted.
