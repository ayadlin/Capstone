Abstract
A phase 2 clinical trial investigating the efficacy and safety of AS602801, a newly
developed JNK inhibitor, in the treatment of inflammatory endometriosis is complete.
We are now examining whether AS602801 acts against human cancer cells in vitro
and in vivo. In vitro, AS602801 exhibited cytotoxicity against both serum-cultured
non-stem cancer cells and cancer stem cells derived from human pancreatic cancer,
non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer and glioblastoma at concentrations that did
not decrease the viability of normal human fibroblasts. AS602801 also inhibited the
self-renewal and tumor-initiating capacity of cancer stem cells surviving AS602801
treatment. Cancer stem cells in established xenograft tumors were reduced by
systemic administration of AS602801 at a dose and schedule that did not adversely
affect the health of the tumor-bearing mice. These findings suggest AS602801 is
a promising anti-cancer stem cell agent, and further investigation of the utility of
AS602801 in the treatment of cancer seems warranted.

INTRODUCTION

and, most importantly, is a viable molecular target for
glioma stem cell-directed therapy [9, 10]. Furthermore, we
have revealed that this key role of JNK is not unique to
glioblastoma, but is shared by other malignancies, such as
ovarian, pancreatic, and possibly lung cancers, suggesting
that JNK inhibitors like SP600125 could prove effective
against different human cancers through the elimination of
cancer stem cells [11-13]. However, the safety profile of
SP600125 in humans remains unknown.
A phase 2 clinical trial (NCT 01630252) of
AS602801, a newly developed, orally-active, ATPcompetitive inhibitor of JNK, was recently completed
to investigate its efficacy and safety in the treatment of
inflammatory endometriosis [14, 15]. Although there
has been one study of the immunomodulatory effect of
AS602801, the anticancer effects of AS602801 have not
been reported to date [15]. Here, we examined the effects
of AS602801 on human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo

The c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) belong to
the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family. JNK
relays, amplifies, and integrates signals from a diverse
range of extracellular stimuli, and are thus involved
in important cellular processes such as proliferation,
apoptosis, and differentiation [1-3]. As such, JNK has
been implicated in a number of human diseases, including
cancer; the growing body of evidence from animal
and human studies suggests a critical role for aberrant
activation of JNK in cancer development, and JNK is
drawing increasing attention as a promising target of
anticancer therapy [4-8].
Although the exact mechanisms by which JNK
contributes to cancer development and maintenance
remain largely unknown, we have demonstrated that JNK
is a key molecule in the maintenance of glioma stem cells

anticancer agent.

surface expression of CD133, a cancer stem cell marker
for various cancer types [16-18]. When the cancer stem
cell fraction surviving AS602801 treatment was analyzed
by flow cytometry, the proportion of CD133-positive cells
decreased in a dose-dependent manner in all cancer stem
cell lines examined (Figure 3A). Subsequent analysis
revealed that the levels of other stem cell markers, such
as Sox2, Nanog, and Bmi1, were decreased similarly
to CD133 (Figure 3B). Interestingly, levels of c-Myc, a
key pluripotency factor implicated in the maintenance
of glioma and other cancer stem cells [19-21], decreased
after AS602801 treatment (Figure 3B). In addition to the
marker analyses, we examined the effect of AS602801 on
the ability of cancer stem cells to self-renew as spheres.
When viable cells surviving AS602801 treatment were
subjected to a sphere-formation assay in the absence of
AS602801, cancer stem cells treated with AS602801
formed fewer spheres compared to control cells (Figure
4). Altogether, these results indicated that, in addition to
its cytotoxic activity against cancer stem cells, AS602801
inhibits the self-renewal capacity of cancer stem cells
surviving AS602801 treatment.

RESULTS
AS602801 shows selective cytotoxic activity
against both serum-cultured cancer cells and
cancer stem cells in vitro
To determine the range of concentrations of
AS602801 that are not toxic to non-neoplastic cells, we
first examined the viability of IMR90 normal human
fibroblasts after treating them with different concentrations
of AS602801. IMR90 cells tolerated up to 10 μM
AS602801; we chose a maximum concentration of 7.5
μM for subsequent in vitro experiments (Figure 1A). To
avoid underestimating cell death, we also analyzed cell
death in situ using the fluorescent vital dye propidium
iodide (PI) instead of trypan blue to reduce the loss of
dead cells during the cell collecting procedure. Using this
in situ method, we confirmed that 7.5 μM AS602801 did
not appreciably induce the death of IMR90 cells (Figure
1B). We then examined whether AS602801 had anticancer
effects. To this end, we treated three serum-cultured human
cancer cell lines (PANC-1, pancreatic cancer; A594, lung
cancer; A2780, ovarian cancer) with AS602801 and
examined their growth. AS602801 treatment induced cell
death and accordingly decreased the number of viable
cells in all three cell lines in a dose-dependent manner,
suggesting that AS602801 may have selective cytotoxic
activity against neoplastic cells (Figure 1A and 1B). We
next investigated whether cancer stem cells derived from
these cell lines (PANC-1 CSLCs, A549 CSLCs, and A2780
CSLCs) were resistant to AS602801-induced cell death.
AS602801 induced cell death in these cells as efficiently
as in the original cell lines, suggesting that the cancer
stem cell and non-cancer stem cell subpopulations within
a cell line are equally sensitive to AS602801 (Figure 2A
and 2B). GS-Y01 cells, which are patient-derived glioma
stem cells, were also tested to examine whether AS602801
has cytotoxic activity against cells established directly
from patient tumor tissues. AS602801 also had cytotoxic
activity against GS-Y01 cells (Figure 2A and 2B).

AS602801 inhibits tumor-initiating capacity in
surviving cancer stem cells
We next investigated whether cancer stem cells
surviving AS602801 treatment also lost tumor-initiating
capacity, which is another key feature characterizing
cancer stem cells. When an equal number of viable PANC1 CSLCs was implanted subcutaneously into nude mice
after treatment with or without AS602801, cells treated
with AS602801 failed to perpetuate tumor growth, whereas
untreated cells invariably formed tumors that continued
to grow progressively (Figure 5A). Intriguing, all tumors
initially formed by AS602801-treated PANC-1 CSLCs
eventually regressed spontaneously. Thus, AS602801
deprived the cancer stem cells of their capacity to selfrenew indefinitely and support progressive tumor growth,
without interfering with their engraftment in nude mice.
AS602801 treatment similarly prevented tumor initiation
by A2780 CSLCs (Figure 5B). These results demonstrated
that AS602801 could inhibit the tumor-initiating capacity
of cancer stem cells that survived AS602801 treatment.

AS602801 inhibits self-renewal capacity in
surviving cancer stem cells

Systemic administration of AS602801 reduces
tumor-initiating cancer stem cells in vivo

Since our previous studies indicated that SP600125
could inhibit the self-renewal capacity of cancer stem cells
without causing cell death, we next asked whether selfrenewal capacity was also inhibited in cancer stem cells
that survived AS602801 treatment. To this end, we first
examined the effect of AS602801 treatment on the cell

We next sought to determine whether AS602801
could reduce cancer stem cell numbers in vivo. Since mice
tolerated daily administration of 40 mg/kg AS602801
(Figure 5C), we treated mice bearing subcutaneous tumors
formed by implantation of PANC-1 CSLCs (primary
tumors) with or without 40 mg/kg AS602801 daily for
10 consecutive days, after which subcutaneous tumors

marker analysis. For the serial transplantation analysis,
we transplanted different numbers of dissociated cells

from the primary tumors subcutaneously into new mice
(1 x 106, 5 x 105, 2 x 105) and monitored the mice for
the development and growth of secondary tumors.

Secondary tumor formation was observed in all but 2
mice (one transplanted with 5 x 105 cells, the other with
2 x 105 cells) transplanted with cells from control-treated
tumors, but only in 2 mice transplanted with 1 x 106
cells from AS602801-treated tumors (Figure 5D). Thus,
systemic AS602801 treatment reduced the proportion of
tumor-initiating cells within the primary tumors. Stem
cell marker analysis revealed that Sox2, Nanog, and

Bmi1 levels were reduced in primary tumors treated with
AS602801 for 10 days (Figure 5E). Similar to the in vitro
results, c-Myc levels in the primary tumors also decreased
after AS602801 treatment (Figure 5E). Collectively, these
results demonstrated that AS602801 could reduce numbers
of tumor-initiating cancer stem cells when administered
systemically to tumor-bearing mice.

DISCUSSION

effects and safety were successfully demonstrated in vivo
in a variety of liver and kidney disease models [25-31].
However, a clinical trial to determine the optimal dose of
CC-401 in the treatment of high-risk myeloid leukemia
was prematurely terminated (NCT00126893). Similarly,
CC-930 entered clinical trials to test its safety in the
treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and discoid
lupus erythematosus (NCT01203943, NCT01466725), but
the trials were terminated because the benefit/risk profile
did not justify continuation of the studies. Thus, publicly
available clinical trial results indicate that AS602801 is
one of a few JNK inhibitors that were successful in human
clinical trials.
Unexpectedly, we found in this study that
inhibition of JNK by AS602801, as indicated by c-Jun
phosphorylation status, was apparently transient and shortlived compared to SP600125-induced inhibition (Figure
6) [11, 32]. Although it is possible that phosphorylated
c-Jun may not accurately reflect JNK activity, and/or that
the transient JNK inhibition was just sufficient for cancer
stem cell inhibition, it is also possible that AS602801
has a unique off-target effect(s) that also contributes to
the inhibition of cancer stem cells. Our data and previous
research indicate that JNK inhibitors do not all act the
same; they have different inhibitory profiles depending
on JNK isoform, different toxicity/safety profiles, and,
presumably, different off-target profiles [4, 22, 23].
Investigations of differences between AS602801 and
SP600125 in future studies may therefore shed light on
new mechanisms by which JNK acts as a therapeutic
target to control cancer stem cells. Additionally, the
inhibitory effect of AS602801 on overall tumor growth
in vivo, in which non-stem cancer cells are important,
is yet to be confirmed. Thus, combining AS602801 with
chemotherapeutic agents that target non-stem bulk tumor
cells might be beneficial in treating cancer.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the
anticancer effects of AS602801, a drug that has recently
been used in a phase 2 clinical trial investigating its

Accumulating evidence from clinical and preclinical
studies demonstrates that JNK is a critical molecule in
the biology of human cancer and an attractive target of
cancer therapy [5-8]. Among currently available JNK
inhibitors, SP600125 has been used in the overwhelming
majority of studies, but the clinical safety profile of
this JNK inhibitor remains unknown [22, 23]. Here,
we investigated the anticancer effects of a novel JNK
inhibitor, AS602801. Our results showed that AS602801
has cytotoxic activity against both serum-cultured (most
likely non-stem) cancer cells and cancer stem cells at
a concentration that does not decrease the viability of
normal human fibroblasts. AS602801 also inhibited the
self-renewal and tumor-initiating capacity of cancer stem
cells surviving AS602801 treatment. Most importantly,
cancer stem cell numbers in established xenograft tumors
were reduced by systemic administration of AS602801
at a dose (40 mg/kg) and schedule (peritoneal injection
once a day for 10 consecutive days) that did not otherwise
affect the health of the tumor-bearing mice. In the clinical
trial (NCT01630252) testing its safety and efficacy in the
treatment of endometriosis, AS602801 (termed PGL5001
in the trial) was given orally to patients at 320 mg/day
(160 mg/day twice a day) for 8 - 20 weeks. Since the
human equivalent of the 40 mg/kg/day AS602801 dose
given to mice here is approximately 3.3 mg/kg/day when
calculated based on the Km of human and mouse [24],
our results suggest that AS602801 was effective in the
preclinical xenograft model at a clinically relevant dose.
Thus, our findings support the use of AS602801 as a
therapeutic agent against cancer stem cells.
JNK is receiving increasing attention as an attractive
therapeutic target in various pathological conditions,
and more JNK inhibitors are being developed [4, 22,
23]. However, developing clinically-applicable JNK
inhibitors is not an easy process. For instance, CC-401
and CC-930 are newly developed JNK inhibitors whose

efficacy and safety in the treatment of endometriosis. With
the available safety information from the clinical trial and
our findings that it can reduce cancer stem cell numbers
in vivo, AS602801 could contribute to the development
of curative treatments against human cancers. Future
investigations are therefore needed to determine whether
this endometriosis drug may also be beneficial in the
treatment of cancer.

glucose [final concentration, 26.2 mM], L-glutamine
[final concentration, 4.5 mM], 100 units/mL penicillin,
and 100 μg/mL streptomycin). Stem cell culture medium
was changed approximately every 3 days, and EGF and
FGF2 were added to the culture medium every day. The
authenticity of PANC-1 CSLCs, A2780 CSLCs, and A549
CSLCs was verified by the genotyping of short tandem
repeat (STR) loci (Bio-Synthesis Inc., Lewisville, TX,
USA) followed by comparison to the ATCC STR database
(http://www.atcc.org/STR_Database.aspx) for Human Cell
Lines. All IMR90 experiments were performed using low
passage number ( < 8) cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antibodies and reagents

Cytotoxicity assay

Antibodies against Sox2 (#3579), Nanog (#4903),
Bmi1 (#6964), GFAP (#3670), phospho-c-Jun (#9261),
c-Jun (#9265), and GAPDH (#5174) were purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly, MA, USA). AntiCD133 (W6B3C1) was purchased from Miltenyi Biotech
(Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). The antibodies used to
detect the expression of Sox2 (MAB2018) and Bmi1 (05637) in GS-Y01 cells were purchased from R&D Systems
Inc. (Minneapolis, MN, USA) and Millipore (Billerica,
MA, USA), respectively. AS602801 was purchased from
ChemScene (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) and was
dissolved in DMSO to prepare a 10 mM stock solution.

Viable and dead cells were identified by their ability
and inability to exclude vital dyes, respectively [32, 35].
Briefly, cells were stained with 0.2% trypan blue for 1 min
at room temperature (RT), and the number of viable and
dead cells was determined using a hemocytometer. The
percentage of dead cells was defined as 100 × (number
of dead cells/[the number of viable + dead cells]).
Alternatively, cells were incubated in situ with propidium
iodide (PI; 1 μg/mL) and Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml) for
10 min at 37°C in a CO2 incubator to stain the dead cells
and cell nuclei, respectively. Subsequently, the numbers
of PI- and Hoechst-positive cells were scored under a
fluorescence microscope (CKX41; Olympus, Tokyo,
Japan), and the percentage of PI-positive cells (dead
cells) relative to Hoechst-positive cells (total cells) was
determined.

Cell culture
The human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 was
obtained from the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical
Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer,
Tohoku University. The human ovarian cancer cell line
A2780 was a kind gift from Dr. T. Tsuruo (Institute
of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of
Tokyo, Japan) and Drs. R.F. Ozols and T.C. Hamilton
(the National Institutes of Health, USA) [33]. The human
non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 was obtained
from the Riken BioResource Center. These cell lines were
maintained in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma) [11-13]. Normal
human IMR90 fetal lung fibroblasts were obtained from
ATCC and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS. Furthermore, the culture medium was supplemented
with 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.
The establishment of human cancer stem cells used in
this study (GS-Y01, PANC-1 CSLCs, A2780 CSLCs, and
A549 CSLCs) has been described elsewhere [11-13, 34].
These cell lines were maintained under the monolayer
stem cell culture condition as previously reported [1113, 34]. Briefly, cells were cultured on collagen-I-coated
dishes (IWAKI, Tokyo, Japan) in the stem cell culture
medium (DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 1%
B27 [Gibco-BRL, Carlsbad, CA, USA], 20 ng/mL EGF
and FGF2 [Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ, USA], D-(+)www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Flow cytometric analysis
Flow cytometric analysis was conducted as
previously described [11]. Dissociated cells were washed
with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed
with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT, and
washed again with PBS. The cells were blocked in FCM
buffer (0.5% [w/v] bovine serum albumin, 0.1% [w/v]
NaN3 in PBS) for 1 h, followed by three PBS rinses and
further incubation with anti-CD133 antibody in the FCM
buffer overnight at 4°C and then with the Alexa Fluor®
488 goat anti-mouse IgG for another 1 h at RT. Gating for
single cells was established using forward scatter in the
isotype control samples. The isotype control samples were
used to establish a gate in the fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) channel. Cells showing a signal for CD133 above
the gate established by the isotype control were deemed
CD133-positive. All flow cytometric analysis experiments
were run on the FACSCantoTM II Flow Cytometer (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).

Immunoblot analysis

viability were determined. Alternatively, the cells were
analyzed for the expression of stem cell-related proteins
by immunoblotting. For systemic administration of
AS602801, the AS602801 stock solution (10 mM in
DMSO) was diluted in PBS to prepare 200 μL solutions
for each injection. The AS602801 solutions were injected
intraperitoneally into nude mice. All control- and
AS602801-treated mice received an equal volume of
DMSO per body weight (3.6 mL/kg). Tumor volume was
determined by measuring tumor diameters (measurement
of 2 perpendicular axes of tumors) using a caliper and
calculated as 1/2 × (larger diameter) × (smaller diameter)2.
All animal experiments were performed under a protocol
approved by the Animal Research Committee of Yamagata
University.

Immunoblot analysis was conducted as previously
described [11]. Briefly, cells were washed with icecold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl
[pH 7.4], 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1%
NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM Na3VO4,
10 mM NaF, 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM
sodium β-glycerophosphate, and 1% protease inhibitor
cocktail set III [Sigma]). After centrifugation for 10 min
at 14,000 × g at 4°C, the supernatants were recovered
as cell lysates, and the protein concentration of the cell
lysates was determined by a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce
Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). Cell lysates
containing equal amounts of protein were separated
by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with
a primary antibody and then with an appropriate HRPconjugated secondary antibody, according to the protocol
recommended by the manufacturer of each antibody.
Immunoreactive bands were visualized using Immobilon
Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore).

Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as the mean + standard
deviation (SD), and differences were compared using
the two-tailed Student’s t-test. P-values < 0.05 were
considered statistically significant and are indicated with
asterisks in the figures.

Sphere formation assay

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The sphere formation assay was performed as
previously described [11, 13]. After dissociation, single
cells were serially diluted in the stem cell culture medium
and seeded into non-coated 96-well plates such that each
well contained a single cell. Wells containing a single
cell were marked under a phase-contrast microscope on
the next day, and 1 week after seeding, the percentage of
marked wells with a sphere relative to the total number of
marked wells was determined.

Mouse studies
Mouse xenograft studies were conducted essentially
as previously described [11, 36]. For subcutaneous
implantation, 6- to 9-week-old male BALB/cAJcl-nu/nu
mice (CLEA Japan Inc., Tokyo, Japan) were implanted
subcutaneously in the flank region with cells suspended
in 200 μL of sterilized PBS under avertin (0.375 g/
kg intraperitoneally) anesthesia. After implantation,
the recipient mice were monitored for general health
status and presence of subcutaneous tumors. For serial
transplantation, primary tumors treated as described in the
figure legend were excised, and, after a wash in chilled
sterile PBS, were transferred into DMEM/F12, minced
with scissors, and incubated in Accutase (Sigma) for
30 min at 37°C. After being rinsed with DMEM/F12,
the cells were resuspended in DMEM/F12 and filtered
through a 70-μm strainer. The single cell suspension
was then subcutaneously injected after cell number and
