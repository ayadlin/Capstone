Abstract
Rapidly growing cells show an increased demand for nutrients
and vitamins. The objective of our work is to exploit the supply
route of vitamin B12 to deliver new derivatives of this vital
vitamin to hyperproliferative cells. To date, radiolabeled (57Co
and 111In) vitamin B12 derivatives showed labeling of tumor
tissue but also undesired high accumulation of radioactivity
in normal tissue. By abolishing the interaction of a tailored
vitamin B12 derivative to its transport protein transcobalamin
II and therefore interrupting transcobalamin II receptor and
megalin mediated uptake in normal tissue, preferential
accumulation of a radiolabeled vitamin in cancer tissue could
be accomplished. We identified transcobalamin I on tumors
as a possible new receptor for this preferential accumulation of
vitamin-mediated targeting. The low systemic distribution of
radioactivity and the high tumor to blood ratio opens the
possibility of a more successful clinical application of vitamin
B12 for imaging or therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2904–11]

Introduction
All living cells require vitamin B12 (cobalamin) for survival.
Before its use in cells, cobalamin must be metabolized into
biologically active methylcobalamin or adenosylcobalamin. In
humans, these cofactors are used in two enzyme systems:
The first enzyme, methionine synthase, uses methylcobalamin to
produce methionine from homocysteine. The second enzyme,
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, uses adenosylcobalamin as a coenzyme to enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Thus, it is not surprising
that rapidly dividing tissues requiring methionine and thymidine
for cell proliferation have an increased demand of cobalamin.
Cobalamin has several characteristics that make it an attractive
entity for in vivo tumor diagnostic and possible therapeutic
application: (a) cobalamin is water soluble and has no known
toxicity; and (b) as an indispensable vitamin for sustaining live,
it is unlikely that a mutational arrest of cobalamin uptake could
occur with concomitant failure of vitamin-mediated therapy.

Studies dating back almost 40 years showed high accumulation of
radioactive 57Co-vitamin B12 in transplanted tumors in mice using
whole-body autoradiography. The authors state that ‘‘one practical
consequence of this may be the possibility of using labeled vitamin
B12 to locate tumors clinically’’ (1). Unfortunately, the long halflife of 57Co with 272 days limits the maximal dose in human
investigations to 37 kBq (1 ACi) per study, which made external
imaging impossible. Furthermore, high accumulation of radioactivity in the liver, the pancreas, and especially in the kidneys was also
observed. Nevertheless, recently, cobalamin derivatives labeled with
short-lived radionuclides have emerged. Occult tumors in mice,
pigs, dogs, and humans could be visualized via 111In- and 99mTcradiolabeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetate cobalamin analogues
(DTPA-Cbl; ref. 2). But again, the greatest focal uptake of these
cobalamin derivatives occurred in the liver, kidney, and spleen
followed by the nasal cavity and salivary and lachrymal glands.
We undertook a new effort to improve targeting of radiolabeled
cobalamin with different analogues (derivatization at the ribose
part, the cyanide ligand, or use of a more stable chelating system;
refs. 3–7) but failed initially to decrease high kidney and liver
uptake due to the intrinsic properties of cobalamin to be stored in
these organs (8). Therefore, another approach was required to
interfere with the storage function of these organs.
Mammals must acquire cobalamin from food where it is present
in extremely minute quantities. For these reasons, its reabsorption
is entirely based on the association of cobalamin with soluble
transport proteins in circulation, namely transcobalamin I (TCI;
synonyms: haptocorrin and vitamin B12 R binder), intrinsic factor
(IF), and transcobalamin II (TCII) and the corresponding cellular
receptors. Cobalamin homeostasis involves adequate transport
through the stomach of cobalamin bound to TCI, subsequent
enzymatic release of cobalamin in the gut, where cobalamin is
immediately rebound by IF and transported as IF-Cbl-complex
across the intestinal epithelium to the blood stream (9). Here,
cobalamin is bound by apo-TCII, the principal B12-binding protein
(10) and becomes holo-TCII. Cellular uptake of holo-TCII is
mediated via the endocytotic receptor TCII-R, inducing ubiquitous
internalization of cobalamin (11). The highest level of TCII-R
expression in human tissue is observed in the kidney, whereas
lower levels of expression are found in the intestine, liver, and
placenta. Another receptor, megalin, is strongly expressed in the
kidneys where it mediates reabsorption and storage of holo-TCII
(12–14). It has been suggested that this kidney tubular cobalamin
reabsorption is similar in efficacy to the intestinal uptake (15).
Megalin is also exclusively expressed in all glands and absorptive
epithelia (16) to absorb holo-TCII.

Vitamin B12 Targeting of Tumors

For clinical application of radiopharmaceuticals, it is known
that high kidney uptake of radiolabeled compounds may lead to
radiation toxicity. Because the radiation dose to the kidney is often
the dose-limiting factor for application of radiopharmaceuticals,
we set out to investigate the possibility of preventing high organ
uptake by disrupting the binding of cobalamin to its transport
protein TCII and, therefore, inhibit uptake mediated by the
receptors TCII-R and megalin. By abolishing binding of cobalamin
to TCII (17), a decreased nontargeted organ uptake can be
expected. Furthermore by interfering with the binding of
cobalamin with circulating TCII, radioactive cobalamin as a small
molecule should clear much faster from the blood than the proteinbound cobalamin, resulting in lower systemic toxicity.
Our new cobalamin derivatives still have vitamin function and
undisturbed interaction with IF and TCI. We hypothesized that an
alternative way of cobalamin binding to tumors might be through
TCI fixation because it is known from the literature that some
tumors express high levels of cytoplasmic and membrane-bound
TCI (18). Therefore, we screened clinical samples of human cancer
tissues (tissue microarrays; TMA) with a monoclonal antibody
against TCI to define high TCI-expressing tumors. These tumors
will be preferentially selected in a planned phase I clinical study
with radiolabeled cobalamin derivative.

Materials and Methods
Synthesis of cobalamin monocarboxylic acids derivatives. Coupling
of functionalized PAMA derivatives to cobalamin requires a reactive group
on vitamin B12. Controlled acid hydrolysis of cobalamin in 0.1 mol/L HCl
yields a mixture of products, with the b-, d-, and e-acids making up the
largest portion. These can be obtained in pure form via an elaborate
purification method, involving ion-exchange chromatography and preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; ref. 17). Starting with
1.9 g cobalamin (1.39 mmol), Cbl-b-acid was isolated in a yield of 280.6 mg
(14.9%), Cbl-d-acid in a yield of 131.5 mg (7.0%), and Cbl-e-acid in a yield
of 94.26 mg (5.0%). The bifunctional, tridentate metal chelating system
(N-3-aminopropyl-N-pyridin-2-ylmethyl-amino)acetic acid ethyl ester was
prepared as described for the pentyl analogue by Schibli and coworkers (3).
The compound is prone to cyclize under basic conditions. Therefore, the
t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc)-protected intermediate was stored, and Boc was
removed just before further functionalization by stirring in diluted
aqueous HCl. The ethyl, butyl, pentyl, and hexyl derivatives were prepared
in an analogous way. The Boc-deprotected PAMA ligands were coupled to
Cbl-b-acid either by using 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodimide
hydrochloride as coupling reagent in water at a pH of 5.5 or by using
2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-y1)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate
(TBTU) as coupling reagent in a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide,
DMSO, and triethylamine. The products were isolated by preparative HPLC
in yields of 33% to 63%. Analytic data and the X-ray structures for Tc(3)Cbl and its nonradioactive Re-complex, Re(3)-Cbl, can be found in a
recently published paper(19).
Derivatization by DPTA. The DTPA-Cbl analogue, cyanocobalamin-b(4-aminobutyl)-DTPA was synthesized as described elsewhere (2).
Labeling procedures. [Na][99mTcO4] was eluted from a 99Mo/99mTc
generator (Mallinckrodt-Tyco) with a 0.9% saline solution. Precursor
[99mTc(CO)3(OH2)3]+ was prepared using the Isolink kit (Mallinckrodt-Tyco;
ref. 20, 21). Chelating of the precursor to Cbl-b-(ethyl-hexyl)-PAMA-OEt was
performed in a 10-mL glass vial with rubber stopper that was flushed with
N2. Twenty microliters of a solution of cobalamin derivative (0.001 mol/L in
water), 20 AL or 200 AL MES buffer (pH 6.2; final conconcentratio, 0.1 mol/
L), and 160 AL or 1,780 AL of a [99mTc(OH2)3(CO)3]+ solution were added,
and the reaction mixture was kept at 75jC for 1 to 2 h. The final cobalamin
concentration was 10 4 to 10 5 mol/L. HPLC analyses with g-detection
were performed to verify full conversion of the 99mTc species. Under these

www.aacrjournals.org

conditions, ester-protecting groups in the chelators were cleaved to give the
carboxylato complexes.
For in vivo biodistribution studies and for in vitro binding studies to the
transport vectors, high specific activity was required. Therefore, radioactivelabeled cobalamin derivative was separated from unlabeled cobalamin on
an analytic HPLC system. Separation conditions were as follows: XTerra RP8
column, gradient; acetate buffer, 10% ethanol (0 min), 25% ethanol (15 min),
and 25% ethanol (25 min) for the b-system. 111In labeling of Cbl-b-DTPA
was prepared as described (2). 57Co-cyanocobalamin (10.5 ACi/50 ng/mL)
was purchased from MP Biomedicals.
Source of transport proteins TCI, TCII, and IF; preparation of TCI
(haptocorrin). As a source of TCI, saliva of vegetarian human subjects was
used. Saliva was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm 20 min at 4jC, mixed 1:1 with
PBS and sterile filtered. The binding capacity of TCI was usually 400 ng
57
Co-cyanocobalamin/mL.
Preparation of apo-TCII. This recombinant human protein was
obtained commercially (Tynes Scientific Proteins). Unfortunately, this
protein was prone to aggregate, and therefore, for practical reasons, a
supply of apo-TCII was also purified from rabbit whole blood (22). TCII was
purified by affinity chromatography on a cyanocobalamin-agarose matrix
(Sigma). Two hundred milliliters of twice centrifuged fresh whole blood
( first time, 5,000 rpm for 15 min; second time, 20,000 rpm for 30 min at 4jC)
was applied to the affinity column, and the column was washed
sequentially. Bound TCII was eluted with 20 mL 4 mol/L guanidine HCl
in 50 mmol/L Tris buffer (pH 8.0) and, in a second step, with 7.5 mol/L
guanidine HCl in 50 mmol/L Tris buffer (pH 8.0). Most of the bound TCII
eluted already with 4 mol/L guanidine HCl, and only this fraction was used.
Probes were dialyzed extensively against H2O for 2 d at 4jC. Typical yields
are 5 to 30 nmol/L that translates into 7.5 to 10 Ag of TCII (molecular
weight, 45 kDa) per rabbit. The binding capacities of the dialyzed samples
were assessed with 57Co-cyanocobalamin and were around 50 ng/mL probe.
IF from porcine gastric mucosa, with a binding capacity of 1 ng of
57
Co-cyanocobalamin per unit of IF, was purchased from Sigma.
Interaction of cobalamin derivatives with transport proteins TCI,
TCII, and IF. The interaction of radiolabeled (57Co, 99mTc, and 111In)
cobalamin derivatives with the transport proteins TCI, TCII, and IF was
measured by a gel-shift assay. Radiolabeled cobalamin (0.05–1 ng) was
allowed to react with an excess of transport proteins for 15 min at room
temperature. This mixture was applied to a gel-filtration column (Superdex75; Amersham Biosciences) with the running buffer PBS and 0.1% Tween
20. Biologically active cobalamin, which binds to transport proteins, shifts
from a molecular weight of f1.4 kDa to 40 to 70 kDa, depending on the
transport protein. Titration of the binding capacity of the transport proteins
was done with 57Co-cyanocobalamin.
Cell cultures. For the biodistribution experiments in mice, the following
cells were cultivated: melanoma cells B16F10 [CRL-6475; American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC)], MEL-CLS-1 (melanoblastoma), MEL-CLS-2
(melanotic), MEL-CLS-3 (amelanotic), MEL-JUSO (metastatic; all from CellLines-Service),8 and M1 (melanoma; University Hospital Zurich); bladder
carcinoma UM-UC-3 (CRL-1749; ATCC) and HT1376 (CRL-1472; ATCC);
kidney carcinoma Caki-2 (HTB-47; ATCC) and Fohn (University Hospital
Zurich); small cell lung carcinoma SW2 (Dana Faber Cancer Institute);
pancreas carcinoma MIA PaCa-2 (CRL-1420; ATCC); colon carcinoma LS
147T (CL-188; ATCC); and prostate carcinoma LNCaP (CRL-1740; ATCC),
neuroblastoma SK-N-AS (CRL-2137; ATCC), and mouse sarcoma S-180 II
(CCL-8; ATCC).
Biodistribution of radiolabeled cyanocobalamin derivatives in mice.
Four- to five-week-old female, athymic nude mice (CD1-Foxn1/nu) and
BALB/c mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Mice were
housed under conditions of controlled temperature (26jC), humidity (68%),
and daily light cycle (12 h light/12 h dark). Mice experiments were approved
by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Kanton of Aargau (Nr.75528). To
reduce interference of high Vitamin B12 levels in mice, the animals were fed
with a Vitamin B12–deficient rodent diet (Harlan Teklad) for 5 wk.

Afterwards, they were inoculated s.c. with the tumor cell suspension (5  106
cells) into the subcutis of the axilla. Radiotracer distribution studies were
performed 12 to 14 d after tumor cell inoculation. The radiotracers were
administered via a lateral tail vein. The animals were sacrificed and dissected
1, 4, and 24 pi of the radiotracer. The selected tissues were removed, weighed,
and counted for radioactivity to determine distribution of radioactivity
within the test animal. The results were tabulated as percentage of the
injected dose per gram (% ID/g) of weight tissue, using a reference sample.
For biodistribution studies with 57Co-cyanocobalamin, 7.4 kBq (0.2 ACi)/1 ng
of the radiolabeled cyanocobalamin was mixed with normal saline and
injected i.v. in tumor-bearing BALB/c mice (syngeneic mouse melanoma
B16F10). After a specified time (5 min to 24 h), animals are sacrificed, and the
organs were weighed and counted on a gamma counter. For biodistribution
studies with 99mTc-labeled cyanocobalamin, 1.85 MBq (50 ACi)/(1–5 ng) of the
radiolabeled cyanocobalamin was mixed with normal saline and used as
before. For biodistribution with 111In-labeled cyanocobalamin, 74 kBq
(2 ACi)/5 ng of the radiolabeled cyanocobalamin was mixed with normal
saline and used as before. To study the effect of Vitamin B12 deficient food,
the biodistribution of labeled cyanocobalamin is compared in mice fed with
normal food with the biodistribution in mice fed with vitamin B12–deficient
food for a period of 5 wk.
Single-photon emission computed tomography imaging studies.
Imaging experiments were performed with an X-SPECT system (Gamma
Medica, Inc.) with a single head single-photon emission computed
tomography (SPECT) device and a computed tomography (CT) device,
24 h pi of the radiotracer. The radiotracer [450–600 MBq (12–16 mCi)] was
administered via a lateral tail vein. The mice were anesthetized with an
isoflurane/oxygene mixture and positioned in the SPECT camera using the
therefore intended animal bed. Depth of anesthesia was monitored by
measuring respiratory frequency. Body temperature was controlled by a
rectal probe and kept at 37jC by a thermo coupler and a heated air stream.
In some cases, imaging studies were performed postmortem. SPECT data
were acquired and reconstructed by the software LumaGEM (version 5.407;
lum 10). CT data were acquired by the X-Ray CT system Gamma Medica and
reconstructed by the software Cobra (version 4.5.1). Fusion of SPECT and
CT data were performed by the software IDL Virtual Machine (version 6.0).
Images were generated by Amira (version 3.1.1).
Microbial agar diffusion test. To test the ability of the cobalamin
derivatives to sustain growth and therefore act as a vitamin, Lactobacillus
delbruekii var. lactis (ATCC 7830) was used. Inoculation cultures of this B12auxotrophic bacterial strain were washed thrice in sterile saline and added
to a solution of vitamin B12 assay broth base (Merck) mixed with agar noble
(Difco) and poured into Petri dishes. After solidifying, sterile filter discs
(Sensi-Disc; Becton Dickinson) were placed on the surface of the medium.
Solutions of Cbl derivatives and cyano-cobalamin as a control were applied
on these discs. Quantitative measurements were carried out to determine
the proportion (in percent) by which the respective derivatives were able to
promote growth and therefore fulfill the catalytic action of cobalamin.
Immunohistochemistry. For analysis of TCI expression on tumors,
immunostaining with anti-TCI polyclonal antibody [chicken anti-TCN1
(ab14273); Abcam Limited] was performed on a TMA. The construction
of the TMA has been reported elsewhere (23). The antibody was diluted
1:50 and incubated overnight at 4jC. Deparaffined sections of the TMA
were manually stained after heat-induced epitope retrieval [10 min; 110jC;
citrate buffer (pH 6.0)] using a standard multilink detection kit (Medi-Stain
HRP DAB; mediteAG), including endogenous peroxidase block, block of
nonspecific binding, horseradish peroxidase, and diaminobenzidene as
chromogen. The TCI expression on the TMA was semiquantitatively
assessed by one observer (NGS) and assistance was received for ambiguous
cases (HM). The staining pattern was confirmed on every individual spot. In
a first step, staining intensity of positive tumor cells was recorded as
follows: weak (1+), moderate (2+), or strong (3+). In a second step, the
percentage of positive tumor cells was calculated and a three-tiered score
(negative, weak, and strong staining) was generated for statistical analysis.
All tumors without staining or staining in up to 10% of tumor cells were
regarded as negative. Tumors with 1+ staining intensity in >10% or 2+
staining intensity in 11% to 50% were considered weakly positive. Spots with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (8). April 15, 2008

2+ intensity in >50% of the tumor cells or 3+ intensity in >10% of tumor cells
were considered strongly positive. The relatively high cutoff value of 10%
was set to rule out false positive results. Cell nuclei were stained by
hematoxylin.

Results
Interaction of radioactive cobalamin derivates with transport proteins. The pathway of cobalamin uptake involves a series
of transport proteins. The main transport proteins are TCI from
saliva, IF in the gut, and the primary serum transport protein
TCII. A series of cobalamin derivatives with increasing linker
chain length between the cobalamin unit and the radiometallic
unit ranging from ethyl to hexyl [Tc(2)-Cbl to Tc(6)-Cbl] were
synthesized (Fig. 1) and tested for binding to these three transport
proteins. All cobalamin derivatives were built from cyanocobalamin-b-acid, derived by mild acid hydrolysis of the acid amide side
chain of cyanocobalamin. All conjugates carry the monoanionic
PAMA-ligand ([pyridine-2-ylmethyl-amino]-acetic acid; ref. 3), with
an NNO-donor set that can be quantitatively labeled with
[99mTc(OH2)3(CO)3]+ (yields >98%; refs. 24, 25). For comparison,
the 111In-DTPA-Cbl analogue, 57Co-Cbl, Tc-Cbi (26), and Tc-PAMA
were also included in these studies and tested for transport protein
binding.
The interaction of the cobalamin derivatives with the transport
proteins was measured by a gel-shift assay (Fig. 2). Radiolabeled
cobalamin was allowed to react with an excess of transport
proteins. This mixture was applied on a gel-filtration column to
separate free activity from protein-bound activity. Biologically
active cobalamin bound to transport proteins exhibit a molecular
weight shift from f1.5 kDa to 40 to 60 kDa, depending on the
transport protein. As seen in Table 1, all cobalamin derivatives
bound to TCI and IF. Short chain length Tc(2)-Cbl, Tc(3)-Cbl, and
Tc(4)-Cbl lost their binding to TCII. By increasing the linker above

four, the derivatives regained the binding ability to TCII. 111In-Cbl
and 57Co-Cbl interacted with all three transport proteins.
In vivo distribution of cobalamin derivatives. Our set of new
cobalamin analogues was compared with the ‘‘native’’ 57Co-Cbl and
the clinically tested 111In-DPTA-Cbl for tissue distribution and
tumor uptake in mice carrying syngeneic B16F10 melanoma
tumors. Tumor uptake of our best derivative Tc(4)-Cbl was not
dependent on functional TCII binding and reached even higher
values of percent injected dose per gram tissue than TCII binders

such as Tc(6)-Cbl, 111In-Cbl, or 57Co-Cbl (Supplementary Table S1;
Fig. 3). When comparing Tc(4)-Cbl (TCII nonbinder) with Tc(6)-Cbl
(TCII binder), all tissues showed statistically significant lower
uptake of radioactivity, except for the tumor. Tumor to blood ratios
of f90:1 was achieved with the derivative Tc(4)-Cbl compared with
ratios well below 10:1 for TCII binders. All TCII nonbinder
derivatives displayed a fast blood clearance, with a half-life Ta of
2.2 min and Th of 36 min for Tc(4)-Cbl. Because Tc(4)-Cbl still
binds efficiently to TCI, we investigated the possibility that tumor
uptake is mediated by TCI. We tested if another TCI binder, namely
cobinamide, could interfere with the binding of Tc(4)-Cbl to
melanoma tumors. Competition experiments with cobinamide
completely blocked the uptake of labeled Tc(4)-Cbl with equal
efficiency as free cobalamin (Supplementary Table S1).
A limited amount of other xenografted tumors were also tested
in nu/nu mice. We scored a tumor as positive when >2% injected
dose per gram of tissue was observed. In negative xenografts, <1%
injected dose per gram of tissue accumulated at the tumor site.
All six melanomas tested were positive; two bladder carcinomas,
one pancreas carcinoma, one small cell lung carcinoma, and one of
two renal carcinomas (clear cell) were positive, whereas colon
(one), prostate (one), and neuroblastoma (one) were negative.
Mouse sarcoma was also negative, although this tumor gave a
positive enrichment with the 111In-DTPA derivative.
One of the melanoma xenografts (CLS-1) showed a very high
tumor uptake (up to 13% injected dose per gram of tissue) after
24 hours. In the same xenograft, high circulating activity was seen
after 24 hours (up to 14%). In the literature, very high serum TCI
levels have been found in patients with metastatic cancer. When
analyzing serum of our mouse xenograft on a gel filtration sizing
column, the radioactivity was associated with a molecular mass of
120 to 140 kDa, whereas in the mouse model with B16F10 tumors,
only free cobalamin with a molecular mass of 1.5 kDa could be
detected in serum.
TCI expression by immunohistochemical analysis of human
tissues microarray. A plausible mechanism of cobalamin uptake
could be the consequence of tumors expressing de novo binding
proteins such as TCI. High expression of TCI on the tumor would
help to satisfy the increased demand for cobalamin. Therefore, a
multitissue TMA was used to analyze TCI expression in different
tumor types and normal tissues. The TMA comprised a total of
184 tissue cylinders. One hundred thirty three tumor spots and
37 normal tissue spots were interpretable for TCI staining. TCI
expression in positive tissues was detected in the cytoplasm of
some normal epithelial cells and various tumor cells. Strong TCI
positivity was found in seminoma of the testis, breast cancer

weak TCI expression was renal tissue and the palatine tonsil. There
was no TCI expression in pancreatic cancer (ductal adenocarcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, and neuroendocrine cancer) and small
cell lung cancer. Placenta and normal pancreas revealed also no
TCI expression. The findings are exemplified in Fig. 4 and
Supplementary Table S2.

preformed with tumor-bearing mice with a dedicated small animal
SPECT/CT scanner. Scan time varied between 30 and 60 minutes.
Whole body SPECT/CT of a mouse bearing a melanoma tumor at
the neck was performed with Tc(4)-Cbl (Fig. 5A) 24 hours after
i.v. injection and compared with a scan of a mouse with TCIIactive Tc(6)-Cbl (Fig. 5B). These pictures clearly confirm the
different tissue distribution between a TCII nonbinder and binder
derivative, showing only radioactivity in the tumor, kidney, and
intestine for the nonbinder Tc(4)-Cbl, whereas with the binder
Tc(6)-Cbl, the radioactivity is systemically distributed. The SPECT/
CT scans with a high resolution, low sensitivity pinhole collimator
of the head of mice injected with Tc(4)-Cbl and Tc(6)-Cbl are
shown in Fig. 5C and D and confirms the striking difference in
accumulation of the two molecules. Tc(4)-Cbl was only enriched
at the tumor site, whereas Tc(6)-Cbl also accumulated at sites
with high megalin content such as thyroid, lachrymal glands, and
salivary glands.
Vitamin function of Tc(3)-Cbl and Tc(4)-Cbl. We selected a
vital vitamin as radiopharmaceutical, because its pivotal uptake
should prevent any kind of mutations leading to a diminished
import of this vitamin. To test the derivatives for vitamin function,
we used a microbial growth assay. The internationally recommended tester strain for vitamin B12, Lactobacillus delbruekii
(ATCC 7830; ref. 27) was applied to study the derivatives for their
activity as a vitamin. Supply of normal cobalamin or Tc(3)-Cbl and
Tc(4)-Cbl to this B12-auxotrophic bacterial strain in a vitamin B12–
free assay medium resulted in a growth response, as measured by
a quantitative solid diffusion plate assay. This assay showed a
functional catalytic activity of 20% for Tc(3)-Cbl and 10% for Tc(4)Cbl when compared with normal cobalamin. These derivatives can
still act as key growth factors.

injected cobalamin were 1 to 20 ng per mouse. As a proof for specificity of the
tracer uptake, 20 ng of radioactive Tc(4)-Cbl was mixed with 500 ng nonlabeled
Tc(4)-Cbl or cobinamide to compete for organ enrichment [punctuated bars

Vitamin B12–mediated targeting as a mechanism to increase
drug uptake by tumors was always thought to be dependent on
undisturbed interaction of cobalamin with the main transport
proteins IF, TCI, and TCII. Earlier reported derivatives were
selected on the assumption that high uptake in tumors can only be
achieved through binding to TCII (2, 28–31).

Vitamin B12 Targeting of Tumors

Our previous efforts to improve cobalamin targeting of radiolabeled cobalamin with new analogues (derivatization at the ribose
part or the cyanide ligand, or using a more stable chelating system)
were centered on the same effort not to impair TCII recognition
(5). Although TCII interaction was maintained, which can be
explained by the overall structure of the recently crystallized holoTCII (32), our data did not show an improvement in differentiation
between normal tissue and tumor compared with already
published results (2, 33). All these derivatives showed disturbing
high renal accumulation.
Therefore, we completely changed the concept of tumor
targeting by TCII receptor–mediated endocytosis and searched
instead for derivatives that still show high tumor uptake but do not
accumulate in the kidney. Megalin is responsible for Cbl-TCII
endocytosis, and interrupting the binding of cobalamin to TCII
should therefore also interrupt Cbl-TCII uptake. In the literature,
cobalamin-biotin conjugates that vary in the position of cobalamin
coupling have been described. Biotin derivatives at the b-side chain
showed little interaction with TCII and were thought to be used for
applications where decreased binding with transport proteins is
desired (17). Thus, we synthesized and tested a set of cobalamin
derivatized at the b-side chain with increasing chain length. Data
published showed that increasing the spacer length beyond a
certain length resulted in regained binding of derivatives to the
transport proteins (34). Our own data showed no binding to TCII
for the three derivatives with short chain length Tc(2)-Cbl, Tc(3)-

Cbl, and Tc(4)-Cbl but still maintaining tumor uptake. These three
derivatives had strongly diminished binding to TCII, yet still were
capable of interaction with TCI and IF and showed function as a
vitamin. Increasing the chain length beyond butyl restored the
interaction to TCII (Supplementary Table S1; Table 1) for Tc(5)-Cbl
and Tc(6)-Cbl. Tc(4)-Cbl with tumor to blood ratio of 90 and tumor
to kidney ratio of 2.6 was chosen as the best derivative. These data
for Tc(4)-Cbl exceeds distinctly those of the clinically tested(2)
111
In-DTPA-Cbl derivative with tumor to blood ratio of 6 and tumor
to kidney ratio of only 0.5 (Fig. 3).
Experiments with Tc(4)-Cbl derivative with no TCII binding
showed that malignant and fast growing tumors such as
melanoma are no longer dependent on the transport protein
TCII to mediate high uptake of cobalamin. Because Tc(4)-Cbl still
binds efficiently to TCI, we investigated the possibility that tumor
uptake is mediated by TCI. A plausible mechanism of Cbl-uptake
could be the consequence of tumors expressing de novo binding
proteins such as TCI. High expression of TCI on the tumor would
help to satisfy the increased demand for cobalamin. High levels of
the cobalamin-binding protein TCI have been described in
malignancies such as cancer of the breast, colon, pancreas, lung,
liver, kidney, salivary gland, stomach, and endometrial adenocarcinoma (35–40). It has been suggested that tumors are capable
of producing TCI (41, 42) themselves. Immunohistochemically,
TCI has recently been localized to the membrane and cytoplasm
of tumor cells (43). Therefore, we extended the database of TCI

clear cell kidney cancer (12 ), glioblastoma multiforme (13), lobular breast cancer (14), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (15 ).

expression in tumor and benign tissues by screening TMAs with an
antibody against TCI. When analyzing 170 different tumors and
normal tissues, we confirmed and expanded the previous data on
high TCI expression in a multitude of tumors (Fig. 4; Supplementary
Table S2).
The nature of the uptake mechanism was further investigated by
competing the binding of Tc(4)-Cbl to melanoma tumors with the
cobalamin precursor cobinamide. Cobinamide also binds strongly
to TCI with no binding to IF or TCII. Competition experiments
with cobinamide injected 4 hours before Tc(4)-Cbl application
completely blocked the binding at the tumor site of Tc(4)-Cbl with
equal efficiency as free cobalamin. This experiment suggests that
binding to the tumor site is indeed TCI mediated.
Abolishing binding of cobalamin to the transport protein TCII
also completely destroyed binding of Cbl-TCII to megalin.
Megalin is not able to bind free cobalamin but only cobalamin
complexed with TCII. This lack of binding has the consequence
that tissues with high megalin expression, especially kidney, glands,
and absorptive epithelia show a much lower or no uptake at all of
Cbl-derivatives Tc(2)-(4). As shown in Fig. 5, there is a striking
difference in tissue distribution between a TCII nonbinder Tc(4)Cbl (Fig. 5A) and a TCII binder TC(6)-Cbl molecule (Fig. 5B).
The eliminated megalin interaction is responsible for the lack of

the high resolution SPECT scans (Fig. 5C and D).
In conclusion, we have synthesized a set of cobalamin analogues
with abolished interaction with TCII. These analogues still showed
vitamin function. Blocking TCII interaction resulted in decreased
nontargeted binding to organs predestined to have high cobalamin
uptake. Binding to TCI and IF remained unchanged. This pattern of
interaction is unique and not expected from experimental (45–47)
and theoretical data (32, 48). Exploiting an alternative way of
cobalamin uptake, most likely TCI-mediated, high tumor accumulation of Tc(4)-Cbl could be observed in a subset of malignancies.
The low systemic distribution of radioactivity and the high tumor
to blood ratio opens the possibility of a promising clinical
application for cobalamin. Clinical trials to prove this concept
will be initiated by the Paul Scherrer Institute in collaboration with
the University Hospital Zurich.
