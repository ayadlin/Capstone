Abstract
Molecular aberrations of the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK and/or Murine double minute (MDM2)/p53 signaling pathways have been reported
in 80% and 50% of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples and confer poor outcome. In this study,
antileukemic effects of combined MEK inhibition by AZD6244 and nongenotoxic p53 activation by MDM2
antagonist Nutlin-3a were investigated. Simultaneous blockade of MEK and MDM2 signaling by AZD6244
and Nutlin-3a triggered synergistic proapoptotic responses in AML cell lines [combination index (CI) = 0.06 ±
0.03 and 0.43 ± 0.03 in OCI/AML3 and MOLM13 cells, respectively] and in primary AML cells (CI = 0.52 ± 0.01).
Mechanistically, the combination upregulated levels of BH3-only proteins Puma and Bim, in part via transcriptional upregulation of the FOXO3a transcription factor. Suppression of Puma and Bim by short interfering RNA
rescued OCI/AML3 cells from AZD/Nutlin-induced apoptosis. These results strongly indicate the therapeutic
potential of combined MEK/MDM2 blockade in AML and implicate Puma and Bim as major regulators of AML
cell survival. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2424–34. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemias (AML) are clonal malignancies of
the hematopoietic stem cell. Many aberrant molecular events
have been implicated in leukemogenesis. For example, constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling pathway is reported in >80% of primary
AML samples (1) and was identified by us as an independent
prognostic factor in patients with AML (2). Furthermore,
overexpression of the Murine double minute (MDM2) protein is present in 50% of AML (3). MDM2 not only rapidly
degrades p53 through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (4) but
is also upregulated by p53 at the transcriptional level as a

negative feedback loop of p53 activity (5). Interestingly, simultaneous loss-of-function p53 and MAPK (Ras) activation
was shown to be synergistic in the malignant transformation
of murine and human colon cells, and the overexpression of
antiapoptotic Bcl-2 with concomitant activation of MAPK
(Ras) signaling induces AML in mice (6–8).
Targeting special signaling pathways with small molecule
inhibitors is a potential novel therapeutic strategy for AML.
Several small molecule inhibitors of Raf/MAPK/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK signaling
pathway, including CI-1040, PD98059, sorafenib, and U0126,
were characterized by us and others in AML models (IC50,
between 0.03 and 5.4 μmol/L), but as single agents, they thus
far showed only modest efficacy in clinical trials (9–13).
Recently, a second-generation highly selective allosteric
inhibitor of MEK1/2, AZD6244 (AstraZeneca, also known
as ARRY-142886), was reported to inhibit basal phosphorylation of ERK in a series of human tumor cell lines, with
an IC50 of around 10 nmol/L. Based on its reported antitumor efficacy in solid tumor models of hepatocellular, colon,
myeloma, thyroid, and cutaneous cancer, AZD6244 has recently entered clinical trials (14–19).6 Our study in human
leukemic cell lines has shown that AZD6244 suppressed retinoblastoma phosphorylation and modulated cell cycle–related

proteins, which resulted in G1 cell cycle arrest in AML cells
with constitutively activated ERK (20).
However, similar to other MAPK inhibitors, AZD6244, as a
single agent, functions as a cytostatic rather than cytotoxic
agent in malignancies (20, 21). Hence, combination therapeutic
strategies that target multiple signaling pathways might enhance its proapoptotic potential. For example, a small molecule
antagonist of MDM2, Nutlin-3a, which induces wild-type,
unmutated p53, has been shown by us to induce apoptosis in
AML (22). We have recently reported that the combination
of MEK inhibitor PD98059 and Nutlin-3a induces synergistic
proapoptotic effects in leukemia cells (23); however, the
mechanisms underlying that activity were not fully understood.
In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying antileukemic efficacy of AZD6244 and Nutlin-3a in AML.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) was provided by
Dr. Paul Smith, AstraZeneca, and Nutlin-3a was supplied by
Dr. Lyubomir T. Vassilev, Hoffmann-La Roche. All other chemicals and solvents used were of the highest grade commercially available.
Cell lines and primary AML samples. The human AML
cell lines HL60 and U937 were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection, OCI/AML3 cells were kindly provided by
Dr. Mark D Minden (Princess Margaret Hospital), and
MOLM13 cells were obtained from Fujisaki Cell Center,
Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories, Inc. OCI/AML3-p53
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and OCI/AML3-Vector cells were
generated by retroviral infection with p53 shRNA plus green
fluorescent protein (GFP) or GFP-only expressing gene, as
previously described (24).
Primary peripheral blood and bone marrow samples were
obtained from patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed
and/or refractory AML (Supplementary Table S1). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient according to
institutional guidelines.
All cells, including primary patient samples, were cultured
in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS.
Cell viability and apoptosis assays. Cell viability was assessed using the trypan blue dye exclusion method, and apoptosis was determined by Annexin V positivity detected by
flow cytometry, as previously described (25). All experiments
were performed in triplicate.
Western blot. For immunoblot analysis, the cells were
treated with the indicated agents and then collected in lysis
buffer (26). For analysis of the protein levels in different fractions of the cells, a nuclear extraction kit (Active Motif) was
used for separating cytosolic and nuclear fractions following
the manufacturer's instructions. The semiquantitative immunoblotting data were generated by using Scion imaging software (Beta 4.03; Scion Corporation).
TaqMan real-time reverse transcription–PCR. OCI/
AML3 and MOLM13 cells were treated with indicated concentrations of AZD6244 and/or Nutlin-3a for 24 h. Total
RNA was isolated, and first strand cDNA was generated using
random hexamers. The mRNA expression levels of FOXO3a,

www.aacrjournals.org

Puma, Bim, Mcl-1, and Abl-1 were quantified using TaqMan
gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems), as previously
described (27). The real-time PCR experiments were carried
out in triplicate.
Simultaneous targeting of multiple signaling pathways.
Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 at 3 × 105/mL and were
treated with varying concentrations of the signaling inhibitors AZD6244 and/or Nutlin-3a for 48 h. The induction of apoptosis was determined by measuring the percentage of
Annexin V–positive cells with flow cytometry. The isobologram and combination index (CI) analyses were performed
using CalcuSyn software (BioSoft), a widely used method
for evaluating combinatorial synergy between cancer therapeutic agents (28).
Immunofluorescence staining and confocal analysis.
OCI/AML3 cells were treated with AZD6244 and Nutlin-3a
for 24 h. The cells were then immunostained with indicated
antibodies and observed with a confocal laser scanning microscope system, as previously described (13).
Cell transfection with short interfering RNAs. For knockdown of Puma, Bim, and FOXO3a proteins, the indicated
short interfering RNAs (siRNA) and mock control siRNA were
purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc. Transfections of
OCI/AML3 leukemia cells were carried out by electroporation using the Nucleofection system (T-solution, X-001;
Amaxa), following the manufacturer's instructions. The final
concentration of siRNA was 200 nmol/L. After 24 h of transfection, the indicated concentrations of AZD6244 and Nutlin3a were added to the cells for an additional 6 or 24 h of
culturing. Apoptosis induction was determined by measuring
the percentage of Annexin V–positive cells via flow cytometry,
and expression level of the relative proteins was analyzed by
immunoblotting.
Statistical analysis. Student's t test was used to analyze
the immunoblot, cell growth, and apoptosis data. P values
of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. For evaluating the synergistic efficacies of AZD6244 and Nutlin-3a, CI
values were determined according to the method of Chou
and Talalay (29). A CI value of 1 indicates an additive effect,
a CI value of <1 indicates synergy, and a CI value of >1 indicates antagonism. The average CI values were calculated at
different effect levels [50% effective concentration (EC50),
EC75, and EC90]. All statistical tests were two sided.
The details of Materials and Methods, including antibodies, cell lines, Western blot analyses, TaqMan real-time reverse transcription–PCR, immunofluorescence staining, and
confocal analyses, are available online as Supplementary Data.

Results
Simultaneous targeting of MEK and MDM2 synergistically inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in human
AML cells. We first examined the effects of the MEK inhibitor
AZD6244 on cell growth and apoptosis of human AML cell
lines. AML cells with constitutively activated ERK (e.g.,
OCI/AML3, HL60, and MOLM13 lines) were more sensitive
to AZD6244-induced growth inhibition than U937 cells,
which have a lower basal level of phosphorylated ERK: the

with 40.4 μmol/L (95% CI, 33.0–49.3 μmol/L for U937 cells).
However, only moderate apoptosis induction was observed

D, expression of cell cycle–related checkpoint proteins was determined by immunoblotting after 24 h of AZD6244/Nutlin-3a treatment.

To further investigate whether the combination treatment
in the sensitive cell lines affects cell cycle progression,
BrdUrd incorporation assay was determined by anti-BrdUrd
staining of pulsed OCI/AML3 or MOLM13 after AZD6244
and/or Nutlin-3a treatment. Results indeed showed reduction of percentage of cells entering S phase upon combined

levels were observed in cells cotreated with AZD/Nutlin,
which exceeded the changes caused by either drug alone.
Nutlin-3a induced MDM2 as previously reported, but this
effect was blunted upon combined treatment. In turn, p21
and Noxa were modified differently in OCI/AML3 and
MOLM13 cells (Fig. 2A).
We next investigated modulation of expression of the transcription factor FOXO3a, a known modulator of Bim expression. Interestingly, AZD6244, as a single agent, profoundly
suppressed FOXO3a phosphorylation at the Ser344 and less
so at the Ser425 site, and combined treatment further suppressed FOXO3a phosphorylation at both sites and upregulated total FOXO3a level. On the contrary, the levels of
phosphorylated Akt and E2F-1 were not significantly affected
by the treatment in OCI/AML3 and MOLM13 cells (Fig. 2B).
To further investigate the role of p53 in the modulation of
related proteins and apoptosis induction, we used p53

knockdown cells (OCI/AML3-p53 shRNA) and their respective vector-transduced cells (OCI/AML3-Vector). AZD6244
and AZD6244/Nutlin-3a blocked phosphorylated FOXO3a
in p53 wild-type cells, but not in cells with silenced p53
(Fig. 2C). Notably, basal levels of total FOXO3a were higher
in p53 knockdown OCI/AML3 than in p53 wild-type cells,
and combination treatment upregulated total FOXO3a in a
p53-independent fashion. BH3-only proapoptotic protein
Bim showed a pattern similar to that of total FOXO3a. In addition, downregulation of Mcl-1 and upregulation of Bax
were more significant in p53 wild-type compared with p53
knockdown OCI/AML3 cells. Likewise, apoptosis induction
was higher in the p53 wild-type cells than that in the p53
knockdown cells (52% versus 29% Annexin V–positive cells).
However, proapoptotic protein Puma was lower in p53
knockdown cells but was induced by the AZD/Nutlin combination in both cell types. MDM2 induction by Nutlin-3a was

1 h of pretreatment with pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk, R&D System) and additional 23 h of treatment of AZD6244/Nutlin-3a. C, the levels of the
indicated proteins were determined by measuring the WCE, CytE, and NucE fractions. EL, L, and S indicate extralong, long, and short splice variants of Bim
proteins, respectively. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was used as loading control for the nuclear fraction, and tubulin was used as loading control for the
cytoplasmic fraction. D, the subcellular distribution of FOXO3a, Puma, and p53 proteins was determined by immunofluorescence staining and visualized
by confocal microscopy. The secondary antibodies to FOXO3a and Puma were conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (green), and the secondary anti-p53 antibody
was conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (red). Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue). The arrows indicate apoptotic cells.

profound, as expected, in a p53-dependent fashion, but this
induction was inhibited by AZD6244 (Fig. 2C).
Furthermore, effects of AZD6244 and/or Nutlin-3a treatment were investigated in four primary AML samples. The
combination treatment enhanced apoptosis induction in
both peripheral blood (samples 2–4) and bone marrow blasts
(sample 1). The mean CI was 0.52 ± 0.01 (Fig. 3A). This was
associated with upregulation of Puma and Bim and downregulation of Mcl-1, with little change in FOXO3a protein expression (Fig. 3B). Whereas samples 1 and 3 were derived from

AML patients harboring FLT3-ITD mutation, comparable
increase in apoptosis was observed in all four samples tested.
Next, we further examined the mechanisms of changes in
protein expression by determining mRNA levels of FOXO3a,
Puma, Bim, and Mcl-1 in OCI/AML3 and MOLM13 cells by
real-time PCR after AZD6244 and/or Nutlin-3a treatment. Results indicated that AZD6244, Nutlin-3a, or the combination
minimally affected the mRNA expression levels of FOXO3a,
Bim, and Mcl-1. However, AZD-6244, Nutlin-3a, and more
so the combination enhanced mRNA levels of Puma (Fig. 4A).

The pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk reduced AZD6244/
Nutlin-3a–induced apoptosis by suppressing caspase activation and concomitantly prevented the decrease in Mcl-1 levels,
suggesting that Mcl-1 reduction was induced by caspase cleavage (Fig. 4B). Further investigation of the cellular location of
these proteins in OCI/AML3 and MOLM13 cells showed that
combination treatment increased total FOXO3a protein expression in whole-cell extract (WCE) and cytosolic extract
(CytE), but less in the nuclear fraction. Likewise, phosphorylated FOXO3a (at Ser344 and Ser425) was decreased in WCE and
CytE, but less in nuclear extract (NucE). The levels of Puma
and Bim increased significantly in CytE and only moderately
in NucE, whereas p53 protein increased in NucE (Fig. 4C). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed those expression patterns of FOXO3a, Puma, and p53 in OCI/AML3 cells; i.e.,
upregulation of FOXO3a and Puma protein levels occurred
mainly in the cytoplasm, whereas p53 exhibited nuclear translocation after combination treatment with AZD6244 and

Nutlin-3a (Fig. 4D). The expression levels of Puma and p53
were impressively higher in cells undergoing apoptosis
(Fig. 4D, arrows).
Knockdown of Puma and Bim rescues AML cells from
apoptosis induced by AZD6244 and Nutlin-3a. Because
blockade of ERK and MDM2 signaling upregulated protein
levels of FOXO3a, Puma, and Bim, we next determined which
proteins played a key role in combination-mediated apoptosis. The expression of FOXO3a, Puma, or Bim was knocked
down using specific siRNAs in OCI/AML3 cells. Significant
(>70%) suppression of the target protein levels was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A, insert). OCI/AML3 cells
transfected with mock siRNA became apoptotic (50.8 ± 1.9%)
after 24 hours of combination treatment. However, Puma
knockdown significantly diminished the apoptosis induced
by combined AZD6244/Nutlin-3a treatment (to 22 ± 0.6%),
and knockdown of Bim moderately decreased apoptosis (to
33 ± 1.6%). Only a minor decrease was observed in FOXO3a

knockdown relative to control cells (Fig. 5A). To reduce the
potential nonspecific effects of FOXO3a knockdown, combination treatment was shortened to only 6 hours after transfection of cells with FOXO3a siRNA for 24 hours. Knockdown
of FOXO3a partially diminished apoptosis induction (from
28 ± 0.9% to 20 ± 0.4%) by combined AZD6244/Nutlin-3a treatment (Fig. 5B), and this was associated with partial inhibition
of induction of Puma and Bim proteins (Fig. 5C). To further
investigate the effects of knocking down these proteins on
apoptosis induction by AZD6244 and Nutlin-3a alone, higher
concentrations of the inhibitors were used, which would result in ∼50% apoptosis in mock siRNA-transfected cells. The
results showed that Nutlin-3a–mediated apoptosis was significantly abrogated in the cells with knockdown of FOXO3a, Puma, or Bim proteins. However, AZD6244-mediated apoptosis
was most diminished in Bim knockdown cells and less so in
Puma knockdown cells (Fig. 5D). These results suggested that
Puma is a critical mediator of apoptosis induced by Nutlin-3a
and by the Nutlin-3a/AZD6244 combination in p53 wild-type
OCI/AML3 leukemia cells. In turn, Bim is likely a key regulator
in AZD6244-induced apoptosis.

Discussion
The detailed mechanisms of growth inhibition caused by
simultaneous inhibition of MEK/MDM2 signaling pathways
remain undetermined. It is well established that inhibition
of cell proliferation by MEK inhibitors is mediated by G1 cell
cycle arrest. In this study, we have shown synergistic p53dependent inhibition of cell proliferation (BrdUrd incorporation) upon combined targeting of MEK/MDM2 signaling by
AZD6244 and Nutlin-3a in leukemia cells. Progression
through the cell cycle is executed through serial steps controlled by key checkpoint proteins. During early/mid G1, cyclin
D activates its associated CDKs (CDK4 and CDK6), promoting
phosphorylation of retinoblastoma. In late G1 phase, the cyclin
E/CDK2 heterodimeric complex mediates further phosphorylation of retinoblastoma and subsequent release of E2F, which
acts as a transcriptional activator by binding to sites on the
promoters of genes essential for DNA synthesis (30). In turn,
the “Cip/Kip” proteins p27Kip1 and p21Cip1 function as regulators of cell cycle progression at G1 by directly inhibiting G1
phase–related checkpoint proteins and arresting cells in G1
phase. Notably, the combination treatment upregulated p53
and p27Kip-1, downregulated G1 cell cycle checkpoint proteins
cyclin E/cdk2 complex, cyclin D1/cdk4 complex, and cdc2, and
suppressed phosphorylation of retinoblastoma. Growth inhibitory effects of combined MEK/MDM2 blockade were independent of p16 INK4a , one of the modulators of cyclin D1
expression (data not shown). In addition, p21 levels were modulated differently in OCI/AML3 and MOLM13 cells despite
consistent growth inhibition observed in both cell types
(Fig. 2A), indicating that p21 is not the key protein responsible
for the observed cell cycle arrest. Further studies are needed to
precisely map the convergence point of cell cycle regulation by
these two agents.
The limited induction of apoptosis by suppressing MEK
has been reported (21). Our present study showed that

AZD6244 at 0.2 nmol/L concentration for 24 hours induced
only modest apoptosis but combined with Nutlin-3a significantly induced apoptosis in OCI/AML3 and MOLM13 cells,
although suppression of phosphorylated ERK was almost at
the same level (Fig. 2B). This finding further supports the fact
that suppression of ERK activation might not be sufficient for
apoptosis induction in AML, and optimized combination
strategies need to be developed.
We have previously reported that the combination of MEK
inhibitor PD98059 with MDM2 antagonist Nutlin-3a synergistically induced apoptosis in human OCI/AML3 cells. This was
at least in part attributed to the ability of PD98059 to antagonize p53-mediated p21 induction, triggered by Nutlin-3a,
which abrogates p21-mediated apoptotic resistance (31).
However, in the present study using second generation of
MEK inhibitor AZD6244 plus Nutlin-3a, modulation of p21
level did not parallel cell cycle arrest or apoptosis induction,
and p21 levels in fact increased in MOLM13 cells after combination treatment (Fig. 2A). In turn, we observed upregulation
of BH3-only proteins Puma and Bim and downregulation of
antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 associated with apoptosis induction (Fig. 3A). This was associated with p53-dependent suppression of FOXO3a phosphorylation at both Ser 344 and
Ser425 sites and upregulation of the total levels of FOXO3a, a
known transcriptional activator of Puma, Bim, and p27Kip-1
mRNA (32–34).
FOXO3a signaling has been reported to be modulated by
phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway in response to growth factor stimulation via AKT-dependent
phosphorylation of FOXO3a, leading to its degradation in
the cytoplasm (35). FOXO3a also is nontranscriptionally regulated by E2F-1 as its direct downstream target during neuronal apoptosis (36), which is independent of p53 (37).
However, in the present study, AZD6244 or Nutlin-3a did
not affect AKT phosphorylation or E2F-1 levels (Fig. 2B), implying alternative mechanisms involved in the regulation of
FOXO3a. As such, FOXO3a was recently shown to be degraded through MDM2-mediated ubiquitination following direct
phosphorylation by ERK at several sites (Ser294, Ser344, and
Ser425; ref. 38). In fact, our data showed that inhibition of
phosphorylated ERK by targeting MEK/ERK signaling was associated with dephosphorylation of FOXO3a at Ser344 and
further dephosphorylation at Ser344 and Ser425 by simultaneous targeting of MEK/MDM2 signaling. The latter might
result from increased ubiquitination activity mediated by
MDM2, which is likely induced via p53 in p53 wild-type cells.
Interestingly, total FOXO3a level increased in p53 knockdown
cells after either single-agent or combination treatment. We
noted that basal expression of FOXO3a was also maintained
at higher level in p53 knockdown cells compared with their
parental p53 wild-type cells. Lower basal level of MDM2 negatively correlated to the higher FOXO3a level, suggesting that
reduced degradation activation of MDM2 to FOXO3a protein
may result in increasing of FOXO3a level. However, apoptosis
induction in p53 knockdown cells were lower than that in
p53 wild-type cells, and knocking down FOXO3a by shRNA
only modestly reversed apoptosis induction. These suggest
that FOXO3a itself is not the key mediator of apoptosis upon

Figure 6. Mechanisms of synergistic apoptosis induction via combined blockade of MAPK and MDM2 signaling pathways in AML cells. FOXO3a and p53
are transcription factors that modulate levels of the proapoptotic proteins Puma, Bim, Bax, and p27. This schematic diagram illustrates an interaction
of MEK/ERK signaling and an MDM2-p53 feedback loop and their interface with ubiquitination/degradation of FOXO3a and p53 proteins. FOXO3a and p53
are the main transcription factors regulating the levels of Puma, Bim, Bax, and p27 proteins (44–48). ERK activation triggers phosphorylation of FOXO3a
at several sites (Ser294, Ser344, and Ser425; ref. 38) and promotes phosphorylation of Bim (49). MAPK signaling is further involved in maintaining the
dynamic equilibrium of the MDM2-p53 feedback loop by modulating the phosphorylation level of p53 and the nuclear export of MDM2 mRNA (50, 51). In
turn, MDM2 exerts regulation of FOXO3a and p53 levels by ubiquitination-mediated degradation (4, 38). Simultaneous blockade of MEK/ERK and MDM2
signaling contributes to the mitochondrial-mediated cell apoptosis by upregulating FOXO3a and p53 levels and transactivating Puma, Bim, and
other proapoptotic proteins.

combined MEK/MDM2 blockade. Further studies are required to determine the regulation mechanism and precise
role of FOXO3a in leukemic cell apoptosis.
Impressively, the transcription level of BH3-only protein
Puma, which was originally identified as a p53-inducible gene
(39), significantly increased (up to 12.4-fold and 8.3-fold in
OCI/AML3 and MOLM13 cells, respectively) in wild-type
p53 AML cells upon Nutlin or combined Nultin/AZD treatment (Fig. 4A), indicating p53-dependent upregulation of this
BH3-only protein. However, Puma also increased upon combined drug exposure in p53 knockdown cells, suggesting additional mechanisms of Puma upregulation. As such, FOXO3a
has been reported to play a role in p53-independent Puma
gene regulation (33). Most importantly, knockdown of Puma
expression by shRNA dramatically reversed Nutlin-3a– and
AZD6244/Nutlin-3a–induced cell apoptosis. Altogether, these

2432

findings point out to the critical role of Puma in apoptosis
induction upon combined MEK/MDM2 blockade, possibly
by modulating other Bcl-2 family members, such as Bim,
Mcl-1, and Bax.
The role of Bim in apoptosis induction of hematopoietic
cells has been previously addressed in several experimental
systems. It has been reported that inhibition of ERK1/2 activation is necessary and sufficient to promote substantial increase of Bim protein level by interfering ERK1/2-dependent
degradation of Bim (40). Furthermore, blocking interaction of
MDM2 and p53 may upregulate MDM2 level itself, resulting
in Bim accumulation. In fact, our data showed that blocking
either MEK or MDM2 upregulated Bim levels, and this effect
was enhanced by the combined drugs treatment. No significant changes in mRNA Bim expression was noted, suggesting
that the upregulation more likely results from interfering

Blocking MDM2 Enhances AZD6244-Induced Apoptosis in AML

with the protein degradation rather than activating its transcription. On the other hand, knockdown of Bim by shRNA
only partially rescued AML cells from AZD/Nutlin-induced
cell apoptosis, suggesting the contributory, but not central,
role of Bim in the lethality of combined MEK/MDM2 blockade.
In addition, the effects of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 in apoptosis induction has been reported, which
presents as a complex of Bim/Mcl-1, Puma/Mcl-1, or Bax/
Mcl-1 for maintaining and regulating normal hematopoietic
homeostasis physiologically. When apoptotic signals are received, upregulated Puma and Bim can displace Mcl-1 from
Bak leading to Bak oligomerization, and then Bim and Puma
can interact with Bax, causing its insertion into outer mitochondrial membrane, oligomerization, and cytochrome c release. On the other hand, Mcl-1 protein itself can be regulated
by transcription and/or E3 ubiquitination degradation (41). In
addition, inhibition of Mcl-1 sensitized MEK inhibitor U0126induced apoptosis in melanoma patients (42). Our present
data showed that blocking either MEK or MDM2 led to
downregulation of Mcl-1 and upregulation of Bax, and the
modulation was synergized by the combined drug treatment,
which was more significant in OCL/AML3 cells, which induced more apoptosis compared with MOLM13 cells. However, the decrease in Mcl-1 protein could be prevented by the
pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, which only slightly reduced
apoptosis induction, suggesting that Mcl-1 might not be crucial in AZD6244/Nutlin-3a–induced cell death.
On the basis of these findings, we propose that the Bcl-2
family proteins Puma, Bim, Bax, and Mcl-1, rather than FOXO3a, are key contributors to the proapoptotic effects in combined blockade of the MAPK and MDM2 signaling pathways
in p53 wild-type AML. In fact, Puma and Bim can be directly
upregulated by p53 activation and ERK inhibition, respectively, and trigger mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in AML
cells by associating with other Bcl-2 family proteins, such as
Bax and Mcl-1 (42, 43). That may explain why knockdown of
FOXO3a only is insufficient to abrogate apoptosis mediated
by combined treatment with AZD6244 and Nutlin-3a. However, knockdown of Puma and Bim resulted in protection of
cells from AZD/Nutlin-induced cell death. This was further
substantiated by our confocal microscopy data, showing dramatic upregulation of Puma but not of FOXO3a in early-stage
apoptotic cells. Puma knockdown resulted in protection from
apoptosis induction by high concentrations of Nutlin-3a,

whereas Bim knockdown significantly diminished the proapoptotic effects of high concentrations of AZD6244. Taken
together, these findings indicate that the level of Puma is regulated primarily via Mdm2/p53 axis, whereas Bim protein expression depends on MAPK activation status. FOXO3a
facilitated the upregulation of Puma and Bim expression via
either transcription or degradation.
In summary, our results show that the small molecule
MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 has a profound cytostatic effect
on AML cells with constitutive activation of MEK/ERK signaling. In turn, cytotoxic effects of MEK inhibition are synergistically induced by targeting MDM2-p53 axis with Nutlin-3a.
Mechanistically, Puma and Bim were identified as critical
mediators of apoptosis induced by simultaneous blockade of
MEK and MDM2 signaling, which is partially mediated by
transcriptional activation of FOXO3a. These pleiotropic effects
are summarized in a model illustrated in Fig. 6. Our findings
for the first time identify Puma and Bim as factors in apoptosis
induced by combined AZD6244 and Nutlin-3a treatment in
AML cell lines and primary AML blasts. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that combinatorial targeting of MEK
and MDM2 with AZD6244 and Nutlin-3a has potential as a
novel mechanism-based therapeutic strategy for AML.
