The human body harbors tissues that range in stiffness from the comparatively soft brain to
the rigid bones of calcified collagen that define our frames. This spectrum supports and
influences the underlying cell physiological processes. Cells apply forces and contractile
tensions to probe the stiffness of the surrounding tissue, and they respond appropriately or,
sometimes in pathogenesis, inappropriately.

Embryos are very soft cell aggregates, but the first organ to develop, the heart, stiffens
within days (Majkut et al., 2013). Micro-stiffness, measured at the scale of a cell or a few
cells and expressed in SI units of kiloPascal (kPa), quantifies the mechanical stress needed
for a fractional change in length. For example, a gummy bear is squashed 10% by about 7
kPa of stress. Most tissues require far less stress to deform as much. If the stress is removed
and the tissue springs back, as heart does, then it behaves as an elastic solid, but softer
tissues such as brain do not fully recover and thus exhibit some similarities to a viscous
fluid. Adult tissues–whether man, mouse, or other species–have a characteristic microstiffness that increases from soft brain and marrow to slightly stiffer breast matrix (Lopez et
al., 2011), to much stiffer striated muscle and pre-calcified bone matrix (Swift et al., 2013).
The most abundant protein in adults is the structural protein collagen (specifically collagen
I), and local tissue stiffness increases with the density of this and other fibrillar collagens, as
does the stiffness of gels made with purified collagen. Within cells in normal tissues, the
intermediate filament nuclear protein lamin A also increases with tissue stiffness, whereas
the B-type lamins are nearly constant (Swift et al., 2013). The increase of lamin A level
stiffens the nucleus, particularly the viscosity of the nucleus. In some diseases such as
muscular dystrophy, fibrosis is evident as increased collagen and increased tissue stiffness
(Engler et al., 2004), and lamin A is also increased.

Stiffness affects the functions of intact tissues as well as cells in culture. Very early in
development, collagen I density increases in the heart to form a scaffold supporting
cardiomyocyte’s rhythmic contractions (Majkut et al., 2013). Heart cells sense the
difference: periodic beating is not only maximum for intact hearts with native stiffness, but
also for single cardiomyocytes isolated from the same hearts and grown on 2D collagencoated gels with heart-like stiffness. Striation of myosin II that drives contraction is also
maximized by stiffness.
Early results showed that in 2D cultures neurons branch best on gels that are soft like brain
(Flanagan et al., 2002), skeletal myotubes striate best on gels with similar stiffness to muscle
(Engler et al., 2004), and osteoblasts are most osteogenic on stiffer gels like that of precalcified bone. Gene expression of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was likewise shown to

be induced toward neurogenesis in cultures on soft gels, toward myogenesis on intermediate
stiffness gels, and toward osteogenesis on the stiffest gels, with all of these responses
dependent on myosin II applying forces via adhesions to the gels (Engler et al., 2006).

Cell shape is downstream of matrix stiffness and requires the coordinated activity of many
factors. Within F-actin rich protrusions, F-actin binds matrix via integrin-anchored
complexes, and further back in the cell body the F-actin network also binds myosin II
filaments (Giannone et al., 2007). Myosin II thereby applies tension to the matrix, and if the
matrix is stiff and if the adhesive ligand is abundant, then (1) integrin adhesions are
stabilized, (2) myosin II tractions on the matrix increase further, and (3) a flattened
lamellipodia attaches and spreads on stiff matrix. If the matrix is soft, then processes (1)–(3)
fail and cells do not spread. Plasma membrane remodeling in response to local environment
is also implicated by multiple observations, including an increased abundance of the
caveloae factor cavin 1 as a function of tissue stiffness (Swift et al., 2013).

Regulatory pathways respond to and reflect the local matrix environment as well. For
example, key MSC transcription factors localize differentially depending on the
microstiffness of the substrate. In cells grown on soft gels, RARG and YAP1 are cytoplasmic
with NKX2.5 being nuclear, but these factors translocate when the cells are cultured on stiff
gels to the nucleus or cytoplasm, respectively. For normal regulation of lamin A, high
tension in cells on stiff matrix stresses the nucleus and stabilizes lamin A protein, which
recruits a large amount of RARG from cytoplasm into the nucleus (via a shared binding
factor), so that RARG can drive lamin A expression to be high on stiff gels as well as within
stiff tissues (Swift et al., 2013). Mechanobiological gene circuits can thus be controlled by
tension-suppressed solubilization and degradation of filamentous systems, in a “use it or lose
it” mechanism. Epigenetic mechanisms involved in matrix mechanosensing remain an active
topic of study.
Invasive migration of cancer cells into nearby normal tissue occurs in many processes, and
soft tissues with low collagen matrix levels and larger pores are expected to be more
permissive to this colonization. Indeed, invasion through small pores in stiff matrices can
cause high nuclear stress, sufficient to disrupt the nuclear lamina and increase DNA damage
as well as cell death (Harada et al., 2014). Genomic changes in cancer are surprisingly well
organized by the scale of normal or host tissue micro-stiffness. Chromosome copy-number
changes and translocations in childhood cancers (Chen et al., 2014) increase with tissue
micro-stiffness as strongly as somatic mutations across diverse cancers (Alexandrov et al.,
2013).
