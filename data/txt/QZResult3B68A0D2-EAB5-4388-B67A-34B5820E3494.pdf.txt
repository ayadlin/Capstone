Abstract
Solid tumors express a range of factors required to sustain
their growth and promote their dissemination. Among these
are vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), the key
angiogenic stimulant, and VEGF-C, a primary mediator of
lymphangiogenesis. Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors
offer the potential to inhibit more than one kinase and impede
tumor growth by multiple mechanisms. However, their
potency toward individual targets can vary. Cediranib
(RECENTIN; AZD2171) is an inhibitor of VEGF signaling that
has been shown in experimental models to prevent VEGF-A–
induced angiogenesis and primary tumor growth, yet the
effects of cediranib on VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-3–mediated
endothelial cell function and lymphangiogenesis are unknown. To better understand the activity of cediranib against
VEGFR-3 and its associated signaling events compared with its
activity against VEGFR-2, we used the receptor-specific
ligands VEGF-E and VEGF-C156S. In human endothelial cells,
cediranib inhibited VEGF-E–induced phosphorylation of
VEGFR-2 and VEGF-C156S–induced phosphorylation of
VEGFR-3 at concentrations of V1nmol/L and inhibited
activation of downstream signaling molecules. Additionally,
cediranib blocked VEGF-C156S–induced and VEGF-E–induced
proliferation, survival, and migration of lymphatic and blood
vascular endothelial cells. In vivo, cediranib (6 mg/kg/d)
prevented angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis induced by
VEGF-E–expressing and VEGF-C156S–expressing adenoviruses, respectively. Cediranib (6 mg/kg/day) also blocked
angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis induced by adenoviruses
expressing VEGF-A or VEGF-C and compromised the blood and
lymphatic vasculatures of VEGF-C–expressing tumors. Cediranib may, therefore, be an effective means of preventing tumor
progression, not only by inhibiting VEGFR-2 activity and
angiogenesis, but also by concomitantly inhibiting VEGFR-3
activity and lymphangiogenesis. [Cancer Res 2008;68(12):4754–62]

Increased tumor growth is dependent on the oxygen and nutrients
provided by tumor blood vessels, which also facilitate the
dissemination of malignant cells to distal sites. Metastatic cancer
spread is further enhanced by an increase in lymphatic vessel
growth or lymphangiogenesis in and around the tumor (2, 3). For
many types of solid tumors, the lymphatic system is the primary
conduit for initial metastasis. Malignant cells transported via
lymphatic capillaries and vessels spread to the regional lymph
nodes and are eventually routed into the blood circulation where
they metastasize to the lungs and other distant organs.
The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of ligands
and receptors are potent inducers of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. VEGF-A binds and activates VEGF receptor-1 (VEGFR-1;
also called Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (also called KDR) expressed on
endothelial cells and initiates a signal transduction cascade
affecting numerous processes required for the formation of blood
capillaries (4). These include endothelial cell proliferation, survival,
migration, tube formation, recruitment of endothelial cell precursors, pericyte and mural cell interaction, vascular permeability,
and altered integrin and protease expression. Lymphangiogenesis is
primarily driven by VEGF-C and VEGF-D, which activate VEGFR-3
(also called Flt-4) and induce a signaling cascade similar to that
induced by VEGF-A acting on VEGFR-2 (5, 6). VEGFR-3 is
expressed early in the development on the blood vessel endothelium and is required for remodeling and maturation of the primary
vascular plexus. Later, VEGFR-3 becomes confined to expression on
some fenestrated blood vessels, but is primarily expressed by
lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) and is required for development
of the lymphatic system (7, 8). In the adult, VEGFR expression is
largely reduced on the mature blood and lymphatic vasculatures,
with expression remaining high in only certain vascular beds
(9, 10). These remain dependent on VEGF signaling for survival,
although they exhibit remarkable plasticity when signaling is
blocked and then resumed (10). During physiologic and pathologic
conditions, including cancer, the VEGFRs are up-regulated and
VEGFR-3 cannot only be found on tumor-associated lymphatics,
but also on angiogenic tumor blood vessels (11, 12).
Given that expression of VEGFRs is reduced in the adult on
quiescent vessels, but up-regulated during pathologic angiogenesis
and lymphangiogenesis, these receptors and their ligands are
particularly attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.
Approaches to inhibit VEGF signaling include monoclonal antibodies that target VEGF ligands or receptors (13), soluble receptors
that sequester ligands (14), and small molecule inhibitors that
compete for the ATP-binding site within the receptor kinase
domain (15). Whereas antibodies and receptor constructs are
highly specific, small molecule inhibitors can inhibit more than one

Cediranib Inhibits Lymphangiogenesis

kinase particularly within a structurally related class. Considering
the complexity of the angiogenic and lymphangiogenic processes,
targeting more than one VEGFR is likely required for successful
inhibition of tumor blood and lymphatic vessel growth.
Cediranib (RECENTIN; AZD2171) is an indole-ether quinazoline
that is a potent VEGF signaling inhibitor, with additional activity
against c-Kit that was previously shown to prevent both physiologic
and pathologic angiogenesis in vivo (16). Cediranib inhibited the
growth of a number of different human tumor xenografts (16, 17)
and reduced tumor growth in a mouse model of spontaneous
intestinal cancer (18). The ability of cediranib to inhibit tumor
growth was associated with a decrease in the tumor blood
vasculature preceded by a reduction of VEGFR-2 phosphorylation
evident within 28 hours of treatment (16, 19).
Early clinical studies have shown encouraging antitumor activity
in patients with a broad range of solid tumors, as well as timedependent and dose-dependent changes in pharmacodynamic
markers (20). Results from a recently completed clinical trial have
shown that daily administration of cediranib to glioblastoma
patients resulted in a rapid and prolonged normalization of the
tumor vasculature that subsequently led to a reduction in tumorassociated edema (21). Cediranib is presently in phase II/phase III
clinical development.
VEGFR-2 is a key target for cediranib inhibition of VEGF
signaling, and cediranib has been shown by recombinant kinase
assays to be active against the other VEGFRs (16). For these studies,
we wished to compare the ability of cediranib to inhibit VEGFR-2–
driven signaling and angiogenesis with its effects on VEGFR-3–
specific signaling and lymphangiogenesis. For this purpose, we
used two VEGF family ligands with unique binding properties: the
viral homologue of VEGF-A, called VEGF-E (22), which activates
only VEGFR-2, and a mutant form of VEGF-C, called VEGF-C156S,
which preferentially activates VEGFR-3 (23). Cediranib inhibited
VEGF-E–induced VEGFR-2 activity and VEGF-C156S–induced
VEGFR-3 activity within the same concentration range (1 nmol/L)
in human endothelial cells, and blocked both ligand-driven and
tumor cell–driven angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and cells. For in vitro experiments, cediranib (AstraZeneca
Pharmaceuticals) was resuspended in DMSO and diluted in cell media for
the relevant assays. For in vivo experiments, cediranib was dissolved in 1%
aqueous polysorbate 80 at 0.3 and 0.6 mg/mL. Human dermal microvascular
endothelial cells (HDMVEC) were maintained in endothelial cell media
(PromoCell) according to the supplier’s instructions and used at passages
3 to 8. The NCI-H460-LNM35 (LNM35) cell line is a human non–small cell
lung adenocarcinoma derived from NCI-H460-N15 cells (24). LNM35 cells
stably expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were
established and maintained as described (24, 25). VEGF-C and the VEGFC156S mutant were prepared as described (26). The expression construct
used to produce VEGF-C156S was identical to that used to produce
wild-type VEGF-C except for the G to C mutation at nucleotide 818 of the
VEGF-C coding sequence (Genbank accession no. X94216). VEGF-E was
prepared as described (27). The following antibodies were used: VEGFR-2
and VEGFR-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); phosphorylated tyrosine (Upstate
Biotechnology); phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
(ERK1/2), ERK1/2, phosphorylated Akt, Akt, phosphorylated cAMPresponsive element binding protein (CREB), and CREB (Cell Signaling
Technology); Prox-1 and activated caspase-3 (R&D Systems); platelet/
endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1; BD Biosciences PharMingen);
and Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 secondary antibodies (Invitrogen/Molecular
Probes). Rabbit serum against the lymphatic hyaluronan receptor LYVE-1

was prepared as described (28). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was from Sigma-Aldrich.
Immunoprecipitation and Western analysis. For receptor phosphorylation studies, HDMVECs were grown to confluency on fibronectin-coated
(Sigma-Aldrich) dishes. The cells were serum-starved overnight, the
medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium, DMSO or cediranib
was added, and incubation was carried out for 15 min, after which VEGFC156S, VEGF-E, or bovine serum albumin (BSA; control protein) was added
(500 ng/mL) and incubation continued for 10 min. The cells were rinsed
with cold PBS and then lysed in PLCLB buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5),
1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 100 mmol/L NaF] containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 Ag/mL aprotinin, 10 Ag/mL leupeptin,
2 mmol/L Na3VO4). Protein concentrations were measured by Bradford
assay, and equal amounts of protein immunoprecipitated with VEGFR-2 or
VEGFR-3 antibodies in the presence of 0.5% BSA, 0.02% Tween 20 then
pulled down with protein A–sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Sepharose
beads were washed with PLCLB containing Na3VO4 before resuspension in
Laemmli’s buffer. The samples were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE under
reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
(Schleicher & Schuell BioScience GmbH). Phosphorylated receptors were
detected using the phosphorylated tyrosine antibody, a biotinylated
secondary antibody (DakoCytomation), and streptavidin–biotinylated
horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were
visualized by chemoluminescence using SuperSignal West Femto Maximum
Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce Biotechnology). Membranes were stripped and
reprobed for VEGFR-2 or VEGFR-3. For detection of downstream signaling
molecules, confluent HDMVEC cultures were serum-starved and stimulated
as above. Lysates were prepared, and equal amounts of protein were
separated by 12% SDS-PAGE before transferring to nitrocellulose. Detection
was carried out using phosphorylated ERK1/2, phosphorylated Akt, and
phosphorylated CREB antibodies. Membranes were stripped and reprobed
with the ERK1/2, Akt, or CREB antibodies.
Endothelial cell proliferation. The separation of LECs and blood
endothelial cells (BEC) was performed as described (29). Either 3,000 LECs
or 3,000 BECs were seeded per well in fibronectin-treated 96-well plates and
allowed to attach overnight. The medium was replaced with serum-free
medium containing cediranib or DMSO with 500 ng/mL VEGF-C156S or
VEGF-E. The cells were maintained at 37jC for 8 d. MTT was added
(625 Ag/mL), and incubation continued for 3 h. The medium was removed,
and the cells lysed with DMSO. MTT incorporation was measured with a
spectrophotometer at 540 nm. Data were collected from eight replicates.
Endothelial cell apoptosis. LECs and BECs were separated, and 60,000
cells were seeded onto fibronectin-coated glass coverslips in 24-well plates
and allowed to attach overnight before serum starvation for 24 h. The
serum-free medium was replaced and DMSO or cediranib was added, and
the cells were incubated for 15 min. VEGF-E or VEGF-C156S (500 ng/mL)
was added, and incubation continued for 18 h. The cells were fixed with 4%
PFA, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100.
Coverslips were blocked with 2% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, then
incubated with Prox-1 and activated caspase-3 antibodies diluted in
blocking buffer. The coverslips were rinsed with PBS, incubated with
secondary antibodies, and then rinsed again before mounting on glass slides
with Vectashield containing 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories). Images were collected on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal
microscope with a 40 plan-neofluar objective. Prox-1–positive staining
confirmed LEC identity, whereas Prox-1–negative staining confirmed BEC
identity. Caspase-3 was used to distinguish apoptotic cells from nonapoptotic cells. Relative apoptosis was calculated as the percentage of
caspase-3–positive cells in the test samples divided by the percentage of
caspase-3–positive cells in the nonstimulated control samples.
Endothelial cell migration. Assessment of endothelial cell migratory
activity was performed as described (30). Separated LECs and BECs were
suspended in serum-free media and seeded in the top chamber of a cell
culture insert (BD Biosciences Discovery Labware) with DMSO or cediranib.
The insert was placed in a 24-well plate containing serum-free medium with
control protein, VEGF-C156S or VEGF-E (500 ng/mL); the cells were

incubated for 24 h then fixed with ice-cold methanol. Nonmigrated cells
were removed, and migrated cells were stained with Giemsa (Merck).
Migratory activity was calculated by dividing the number of responsive cells
in the test conditions by the number of cells migrated in the control
samples.
Generation of recombinant adenoviruses. Adenoviruses encoding
VEGF-C, VEGF-C156S, VEGF-A, VEGF-E, and nuclear targeted h-galactosidase (LacZ) were constructed and produced as described (31–35). Protein
expression by the adenoviruses was confirmed by in vitro analysis as
published (36). Briefly, adenoviruses were used to infect HeLa cell cultures
that were then metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine
(Redivue ProMix, Amersham Biosciences) in methionine-free and cysteinefree media. Supernatants were collected from the transduced cells and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
Inhibition of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. All animal
experiments were approved by the Provincial State Office of Southern
Finland and carried out in accordance with institutional guidelines. For the
induction of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, 6-week-old to 8-week-old
male NMRI nu/nu mice (Taconic) were anesthetized with Ketalar (Pfizer)
and Rompun (Bayer) before i.d. injection of 5  108 plaque-forming units
(pfu) of recombinant adenoviruses into each ear. Eight mice were used for
each virus type. The mice were further subdivided into groups of four and
given cediranib (6 mg/kg/d) or vehicle (1% polysorbate) by p.o. gavage daily,
starting from the day of adenovirus injection. One week after injection, the
mice were sacrificed and the ears were prepared for whole mount staining

and analysis performed as described (37). Lymphatic and blood vessels were
detected using the LYVE-1 and PECAM-1 antibodies, respectively, and the
appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody. The ears were
mounted onto glass slides using Vectashield and analyzed on a confocal
microscope with a 10 fluar NA 0.5 objective. Three-dimensional
projections were digitally constructed from confocal z-stacks. Quantification of the area covered by lymphatic or blood vessels in the skin was
performed as published (38). A total of eight ears were analyzed per data
set, and LYVE-1 and PECAM-1 staining was quantified using the ImageJ
program (Media Cybernetics). All statistical analyses were performed using
the unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test. A P value of <0.05 was considered
statistically significant. For tumor cell–induced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, LNM35/EGFP cells were washed and suspended in PBS at
5  104 cells/AL. Female NMRI nu/nu mice were anesthetized, and 1  106
cells (20 AL) were i.d. injected into each ear. The mice were separated into
three groups with six mice per group and treated p.o. daily with cediranib
(3 or 6 mg/kg/d) or vehicle starting from the day of injection. The mice
were humanely sacrificed 2 wk later, their ears were prepared for whole
mount staining, with blood and lymphatic vessels detected, and analysis
was performed as described above. Six tumors were evaluated for each data
set, with images taken from at least three regions.
Changes in vascular permeability. Male NMRI nu/nu mice (6–8 wk
old) were divided into two groups, assigned either cediranib (6 mg/kg/d) or
control vehicle. The mice were weighed and given the assigned treatment
by p.o. gavage. The two groups were each subdivided into three more

Figure 1. Cediranib inhibits specific activation of VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 and associated downstream signals in human endothelial cells. Confluent cultures of
HDMVECs were placed in serum-free and growth factor–free endothelial cell media overnight before pretreatment with cediranib or an equivalent volume of DMSO for
the nontreated controls, and then stimulation with 500 ng/mL VEGF-C156S or VEGF-E. Lysates prepared from the cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP ) with
VEGFR-3–specific or VEGFR-2–specific antibodies before separation by 7.5% SDS-PAGE (A and B), or the lysates were separated directly by 12% SDS-PAGE
(C and D ). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and detected by Western blotting (WB ) using phospho-specific antibodies (top ) followed by detection with
protein-specific antibodies (bottom ). A, the 180-kDa and 125-kDa isoforms of VEGFR-3 are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues when HDMVECs are incubated
with VEGF-C156S. Increased phosphorylation of both isoforms is prevented when the cells are pretreated with 1 or 10 nmol/L of cediranib. B, stimulation of HDMVECS
with VEGF-E results in tyrosine phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, which is f220 kDa. Phosphorylation is inhibited with a pretreatment of 1 or 10 nmol/L of cediranib.
C, stimulation of HDMVECs with VEGF-C156S results in increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, and CREB. This activity is inhibited when the cells are pretreated
with at least 1 nmol/L cediranib. D, increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, and CREB is observed when HDMVECs are stimulated with VEGF-E. The
increased activation/phosphorylation of all three signaling molecules is reduced when the cells are pretreated with a concentration of z1 nmol/L of cediranib.

Cediranib Inhibits Lymphangiogenesis

Figure 2. Cediranib inhibits ligand-induced proliferation, survival, and migration of LECs and BECs. LECs and BECs were separated from HDMVEC cultures and

replicates normalized to the untreated controls; bars, SE. Cediranib inhibited the ligand-induced growth of both LECs and BECs. B , quantification of activated

The data represent the mean value of five replicates, in which positive staining for cleaved caspase-3 indicated cells undergoing apoptosis. For each sample, the ratio of
caspase-3–positive cells to the total number of cells was calculated. These values were then normalized to the value calculated for the nonstimulated control
cells and indicated as relative apoptosis. On average, f73% LECs and 45% BECs were apoptotic in serum-free and growth factor–free conditions. In a dose-dependent
manner, cediranib was able to abrogate the ability of VEGF-C156S and VEGF-E to prevent apoptosis induced by serum deprivation. C, quantification of LEC and

groups (n = 4) and assigned AdVEGF-A, AdVEGF-E, or AdLacZ virus. The
mice were anesthetized, and each ear was injected i.d. with 5  108 pfu of
recombinant adenoviruses. Administration of cediranib or vehicle was
continued daily for 7 d. After this period, the mice were anesthetized and
3% Evans Blue (1 mL/g) was injected via the lateral tail vein 10 min before
sacrifice. The ears were dissected, weighed, immersed in formamide, and
incubated overnight at 55jC. Evans Blue leakage between samples was
calculated by measuring the absorbance of the formamide at 620 nm on a
spectrophotometer. These measurements were divided by the weight of
the corresponding ear, and the relative leakage was calculated by
normalizing to the control vehicle AdLacZ value. Eight ears were evaluated
for each data set.

Results
Cediranib inhibits specific activation of VEGFR-2 and
VEGFR-3 and associated downstream signaling molecules in
human endothelial cells. To examine the effects of cediranib on
ligand-induced VEGFR activity, we used primary HDMVECs, which
are a mixed population of BECs and LECs. VEGFR-2 is expressed
on both cell types, and while VEGFR-3 is expressed predominantly
on LECs, it is also expressed to some extent on BECs (39, 40).
VEGF-C156S induced phosphorylation of the 180-kDa full-length
and 125-kDa processed forms of VEGFR-3, with 1 nmol/L of
cediranib sufficient to reduce induced phosphorylation of both
isoforms (Fig. 1A). Similarly, VEGF-E induced the phosphorylation

www.aacrjournals.org

of VEGFR-2, and cediranib blocked this activation at 1 nmol/L
(Fig. 1B). After ligand-induced VEGFR autophosphorylation, a
number of signaling events take place. These include activation of
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and ERK pathway,
which mediates cell proliferation, and the phosphotidylinositol
3-kinase pathway, which is linked to proliferation, but also controls
cell survival by activation of protein kinase B (Akt). VEGF-C156S
or VEGF-E stimulation of HDMVECs resulted in increased
phosphorylation of p42/p44-MAPK (ERK1/2) and Akt, as well the
CREB protein, a transcription factor linked to both cell proliferation and survival (Fig. 1C and D). Whereas 1 nmol/L of cediranib
was sufficient to block Akt and CREB phosphorylation, higher
concentrations were required to interfere with ERK1/2 activation
stimulated by VEGFR-2 signaling (Fig. 1C and D).
Cediranib inhibits VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 induction of
proliferation, survival, and migration of BECs and LECs. For
comparative analyses of cediranib effects on LEC and BEC
functional activity, proliferation assays were performed on
separated cultures. Stimulation with VEGF-C156S resulted in a
significant increase in LEC proliferation, along with a slight
increase in BEC growth (Fig. 2A, top). A dose-dependent decrease
in VEGF-C156S–induced proliferation was observed upon addition
of cediranib with 3 nmol/L, sufficient to bring the induced
proliferation to background level (Fig. 2A, top). Stimulation with
VEGF-E resulted in a strong induction of BEC proliferation and a

smaller induction of LEC proliferation (Fig. 2A, bottom). However,
the addition of cediranib resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of
VEGF-E–induced proliferation with 3 nmol/L, sufficient to bring
both LEC and BEC growth down near to background levels (Fig. 2A,
bottom). LECs and BECs maintained in serum and growth factor–
free conditions undergo apoptosis; however, the apoptotic process
can be prevented with the addition of VEGF-C156S or VEGF-E as
measured by the presence of activated caspase-3 (Fig. 2B). The
addition of cediranib reduced the ability of the ligands to rescue
both BECs and LECs from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis at
those concentrations that also prevented activation of Akt, which is
known to provide survival signaling (Figs. 1C and D and 2B). As a
further measure of the effects of cediranib on LEC and BEC
function, we also examined its ability to inhibit VEGFR-2–mediated
or VEGFR-3–mediated cell migration. To measure this activity,
LECs or BECs suspended in serum and growth factor–free media
were placed in the top chamber of a modified Boyden chamber
along with control vehicle or cediranib, whereas serum-free media
was placed in the lower chamber along with control protein or
VEGF-C156S or VEGF-E. VEGF-C156S and VEGF-E elicited a strong
migratory response from LECs, whereas BECs responded more to
VEGF-E stimulation (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, 0.1 nmol/L of cediranib
was sufficient to reduce VEGF-C156S–induced and VEGF-E–
induced LEC migration, as well as VEGF-E–induced BEC migration
by f50% or more (Fig. 2C).
Cediranib blocks specific induction of angiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis. To assess the effects of cediranib on ligandinduced lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis in vivo, we used
recombinant adenoviruses expressing VEGF-C, VEGF-C156S,
VEGF-A, VEGF-E, as well as the control LacZ. The adenoviruses
were i.d. injected into each ear of the mice, and the mice were
treated for 7 days with cediranib (6 mg/kg) or control vehicle.
Adenoviruses expressing VEGF-C or VEGF-C156S were powerful
inducers of lymphangiogenesis, as noted from the disorganized
architecture of the lymphatic vasculature and increased lymphatic
sprouting observed by staining for LYVE-1 (Fig. 3A). Similarly,
the VEGF-A expressing adenovirus induced lymphangiogenesis
as noted by the presence of lymphatic sprouts (Fig. 3A). Whereas
the adenovirus expressing VEGF-E did not induce obvious
lymphatic sprouting, lymphatic vessels seemed slightly enlarged
in the AdVEGF-E–treated ears compared with those of the AdLacZ
control ears (Fig. 3A) and as noted by evaluation of the LYVE-1–
positive vessel area (Fig. 3B). However, cediranib treatment
effectively prevented lymphangiogenesis induced by VEGF-C,
VEGF-C156S, and VEGF-A and lymphatic hyperplasia induced by
VEGF-E (Fig. 3A and B). In the blood vasculature, adenoviruses
expressing VEGF-C156S or the LacZ control had little effect on
vessel number or size, whereas adenoviruses expressing VEGF-A
and VEGF-E induced extensive remodeling accompanied by an
increase in the number of blood capillaries, as shown by PECAM-1
staining (Fig. 3C). The adenovirus expressing VEGF-C also induced
a slight increase in the blood vasculature (Fig. 3C), which was
likely due to the ability of processed VEGF-C to bind and activate
VEGFR-2 and possibly the expression of VEGFR-3 on angiogenic
blood vessels. The blood vessels of cediranib-treated animals,
however, seemed normal and were comparable with those of the
controls, indicating that cediranib efficiently blocked VEGFRmediated angiogenesis (Fig. 3C and D).
Cediranib affects vascular permeability. VEGF ligands known
to activate VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 also mediate vessel permeability; thus, we examined the effects of cediranib on VEGF-A–induced

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

and VEGF-E–induced vascular leakage. For this assessment, we
injected the VEGF-A, VEGF-E, or LacZ adenoviruses in the ears of
nude mice and treated the mice with cediranib (6 mg/kg) or
control vehicle for 7 days. Changes in vessel permeability were
measured using a dye extravasation assay with Evans Blue dye
injected i.v. Compared with AdLacZ control-treated animals, a
change in blood vessel permeability was most notable with
AdVEGF-A, whereas AdVEGF-E had only a small effect (Fig. 4).
However, cediranib efficiently inhibited the vascular leakage
induced by both VEGF-A and VEGF-E (Fig. 4). Whereas high levels
of VEGF-C can also induce blood vessel permeability (36), this is
believed to be due to the ability of processed VEGF-C to bind and
activate VEGFR-2, as VEGF-C156S has previously been shown to
have only a very minimal effect on vessel leakage (33).
Cediranib prevents tumor cell–induced angiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis. Whereas most tumor types express VEGF-A
to induce the blood vessel growth required to supply the nutrients
and oxygen needed to sustain their increase in mass, many tumors
also express VEGF-C to induce the growth of lymphatic vessels
used for dissemination. An example of a VEGF-C–expressing tumor
cell line is LNM35, which is a highly metastatic subclone of a
human non–small cell lung adenocarcinoma (41). LNM35 cells
stably expressing EGFP were implanted s.c. into both ears of nude
mice. The mice were p.o. treated with vehicle or cediranib (3 or
6 mg/kg), with treatment carried out once daily for 2 weeks
starting from the day of tumor cell implantation. Examination of
the tumor vasculatures showed that, whereas tumors from control
mice displayed a very dense network of blood capillaries as
observed by PECAM-1 staining, tumor blood vessels of mice treated
with cediranib at 3 and 6 mg/kg/day were far fewer (Fig. 5B). As
observed by LYVE-1 staining, control tumors displayed numerous
lymphatic vessels/capillaries (Fig. 5B). In contrast, there were fewer
lymphatic vessels associated with the tumors of mice treated with
cediranib (Fig. 5B). Quantification of the blood and lymphatic
vessels associated with these tumors showed that 3 mg/kg/day of
cediranib dramatically reduced the number of both vessel types
(Fig. 5C and D). Although a higher concentration of cediranib did
not further reduce the number of tumor-associated blood vessels
compared with the lower dose (Fig. 5C), tumor-associated
lymphatic vessels were further compromised with the 6 mg/kg/
day dose of cediranib compared with the 3 mg/kg/day treatment
(Fig. 5D; P = 0.039). In general, cediranib prevented the growth
of the implanted tumors (Fig. 5A, top). The effect on tumor growth
in vivo, however, was not likely due to a direct effect of cediranib on
tumor cell proliferation, as even 5 Amol/L of cediranib did not
inhibit proliferation of LMN35 cells in vitro (data not shown). In
comparison to concentrations inhibiting LEC and BEC proliferation in vitro, the concentration of cediranib required to prevent
LNM35 cell proliferation was much greater (1 nmol/L compared
with >5 Amol/L).

Discussion
Cediranib was previously shown to be an effective inhibitor of
VEGF-induced signaling and angiogenesis, and by enzyme assays,
cediranib was also found to have activity against VEGFR-1 and
VEGFR-3 (16). We now show that cediranib blocks VEGFR-3–
mediated endothelial cell functions and lymphangiogenesis at
similar doses that inhibit VEGFR-2 activity and angiogenesis. In
many types of cancer, expression of the VEGFR-3 ligands VEGF-C
and VEGF-D is correlated with the occurrence of lymph node

Cediranib Inhibits Lymphangiogenesis

Figure 4. Cediranib inhibits ligand-induced changes in vessel permeability.
Extravasation of Evans Blue was quantified from AdVEGF-A–, AdVEGF-E–, and
AdLacZ–transduced ears 10 min after i.v. injection of the dye. The absorbance of
Evans Blue leakage into formamide was measured on a spectrophotometer
at 620 nm, and these numbers were divided by the weight of the corresponding
ear. The resulting values were normalized to the nontreated AdLacZ value and
indicated as relative vessel leakage. Whereas dye leakage was greatest in
the AdVEGF-A–transduced ears, some leakage was also apparent with
AdVEGF-E. Vessel leakage was inhibited with cediranib treatment (6 mg/kg/d).

metastasis, an indication of disease progression and prognosis for
reduced survival (42). In addition, the formation of lymph node
metastasis can be promoted by VEGF-C and inhibited with a
soluble form of VEGFR-3 or a monoclonal antibody targeting the
receptor (41, 43, 44). VEGFR-3 may also have a role in pathologic
angiogenesis, such as tumor blood vessel formation, and the use
of a VEGFR-3–specific antibody has been shown to reduce primary
tumor growth (45). Inhibition of VEGFR-3 activity is therefore likely
to be therapeutically beneficial.
Although VEGF-C and VEGF-D bind and regulate VEGFR-3
activity, the fully processed forms of these two ligands also bind
and activate VEGFR-2 and induce its associated responses (46, 47).
Therefore, we used the specific VEGFR-2 ligand VEGF-E and the
VEGFR-3 ligand VEGF-C156S to differentiate the effects of
cediranib on VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 signaling in vitro and in vivo.
At 1 nmol/L, cediranib inhibited VEGF-C156S–induced phosphorylation of VEGFR-3 and VEGF-E–induced phosphorylation of
VEGFR-2 in primary human endothelial cells. This was accompanied by reduced activation of downstream signaling molecules
ERK1/2, Akt, and CREB. Additionally, cellular functions associated
with VEGFR activation, including proliferation, survival, and
migration, were all compromised by cediranib. Proliferation of
LECs and BECs induced by either VEGF-C156S or VEGF-E was
reduced with low levels of cediranib, whereas higher concentrations attenuated the ability of VEGF-C156S and VEGF-E to
prevent LECs and BECs from undergoing apoptosis induced by
serum deprivation. Interestingly, cellular migration seemed to be
the most sensitive to cediranib treatment, with VEGF-C156S–
induced and VEGF-E–induced LEC migration and VEGF-E–
induced BEC migration compromised at 0.1 nmol/L, although
there was only slight inhibition of ligand-induced receptor
phosphorylation at this concentration. The tyrosine residues of

B, whole mount staining for lymphatic vessels (LYVE-1, white ) and blood vessels
(PECAM-1, red) along with visualization of the EGFP-tagged LNM35 cells

VEGFR-2 have been shown to mediate specific functions (4).
Therefore, one could speculate that those residues mediating
migratory activity could be more sensitive to cediranib treatment.
Together, however, these results do show that cediranib can

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (12). June 15, 2008

comparably inhibit LEC and BEC functional activity induced by
VEGFR-2–specific or VEGFR-3–specific signaling.
In vivo, VEGF-E stimulation of VEGFR-2 results in increased
vascularization, which we observed as an increase in blood vessel
number, as well as size. This was similar to changes in the blood
vasculature induced by VEGF-A. Examination of the lymphatic
vasculature, however, showed that, whereas VEGF-A clearly
induced lymphatic sprouting, this was not observed with VEGFE. Rather than an obvious induction of lymphatic sprouting, VEGFE resulted in slightly enlarged lymphatic vessels. This effect is likely
due to VEGFR-2 signaling rather than signaling through VEGFR-3,
as anti-VEGFR-2, but not anti-VEGFR-3 treatment, is capable of
preventing VEGF-E–induced lymphatic hyperplasia (35). Whereas
the lymphatic hyperplasia induced by VEGF-E may be a secondary
result of the newly formed, leaky blood vasculature, it is also
possible that VEGF-E directly activates VEGFR-2 signaling on the
lymphatic endothelium, as suggested by the ability of VEGF-E to
induce LEC proliferation and by the ability of VEGF-A to induce
lymphangiogenesis, as observed in this and other studies (48, 49).
Moreover, the extent of vessel leakage induced by VEGF-E was
small compared with that induced by VEGF-A. Similar to the
effects of VEGF-C, VEGF-C156S was capable of inducing lymphangiogenesis in vivo as apparent with lymphatic vessel sprouting and
the disorganized and hyperplastic appearance of the lymphatic
vasculature. Whereas VEGF-C156S had no apparent effect on blood
vessel growth, a slight increase in PECAM-1–positive staining was
observed with the VEGF-C adenovirus. This may have been due to
VEGF-C activation of VEGFR-2 on the blood endothelium and was
inhibited by cediranib treatment. Furthermore, a once-daily
treatment with cediranib was sufficient to block VEGF-A–induced
and VEGF-E–induced neovascularization, as well as VEGF-A–
induced, VEGF-C–induced, and VEGF-C156S–induced lymphangiogenesis. These results suggest that physiologic and pathologic
processes dependent on VEGFR-2–driven or VEGFR-3–driven
angiogenesis or lymphangiogenesis would be equally affected by
cediranib treatment.
Both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis are accompanied
by an increase in vessel permeability (50). VEGF-A is a strong
inducer of vascular permeability, and reports have shown that this
activity can be mediated by VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 (51, 52). In
contrast, previous studies have shown that VEGFR-3 has little to no
effect on vessel permeability (33, 36). While we only observed a
small increase in vessel leakage with the VEGF-E expressing
adenovirus compared with the control, cediranib nevertheless
reduced the effects of VEGF-E, as well as those observed with
VEGF-A. Although the effect of cediranib on VEGFR-1 signaling in
a cellular context has not yet been investigated, it is likely that
cediranib also compromised VEGFR-1 functions mediated by
VEGF-A.
Using the human lung carcinoma cell line LNM35, we observed
the formation of both blood and lymphatic vessels around these
VEGF-C–expressing tumor cells. Treatment with a low dose of
cediranib was sufficient to compromise the growth of both tumorassociated blood and lymphatic vessels. In addition, the growth of
tumors in cediranib-treated animals was impaired. As cediranib
affects signaling from other kinases, in particular c-Kit, it was
possible that cediranib directly affected LNM35 cell growth. In line
with findings with other tumor cells (16, 17), LNM35 proliferation
was only affected by cediranib at concentrations of >5 Amol/L,
which is 5,000-fold greater than that needed for inhibition of
ligand-induced endothelial cell proliferation. The ability of

Cediranib Inhibits Lymphangiogenesis

cediranib to inhibit angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis induced
by LNM35 cells was therefore likely a result of direct effects on
endothelial cells rather than indirectly through inhibition of
tumor cell growth while the effects on tumor growth were more
likely mediated by the ability of the inhibitor to prevent the tumors
from becoming well vascularized.
Tumor progression involves a number of processes, each of
which may be mediated by a number of molecules. Although
therapies targeting specific ligands are advantageous for selectivity,
processes, such as tumor-induced neovascularization, are complex
and may require inhibition of more than one molecule. Tumor
blood vessels, for example, often express both VEGFR-2 and
VEGFR-3. Therefore, inhibition of either receptor tyrosine kinase
alone may not be sufficient to completely inhibit tumor-induced
angiogenesis. Similarly, targeting both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 is
likely a more potent strategy for inhibiting tumor-associated
lymphatic vessel growth. Small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as cediranib, are therefore attractive for their ability to
block activity of multiple VEGFRs. Here, we have shown that
cediranib inhibited VEGFR-2–induced and VEGFR-3–induced

cediranib may prove beneficial in the clinic not only by inhibiting
new tumor blood vessel growth, but may also help prevent further
