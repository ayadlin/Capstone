ABSTRACT
Copper promotes tumor angiogenesis, nevertheless the mechanisms involved
remain to be fully understood. We have recently demonstrated that the G-protein
estrogen receptor (GPER) cooperates with hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α)
toward the regulation of the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. Here, we show that copper
sulfate (CuSO4) induces the expression of HIF-1α as well as GPER and VEGF in breast
and hepatic cancer cells through the activation of the EGFR/ERK/c-fos transduction
pathway. Worthy, the copper chelating agent TEPA and the ROS scavenger NAC
prevented the aforementioned stimulatory effects. We also ascertained that HIF-1α
and GPER are required for the transcriptional activation of VEGF induced by CuSO4.
In addition, in human endothelial cells, the conditioned medium from breast cancer
cells treated with CuSO4 promoted cell migration and tube formation through HIF-1α
and GPER.
The present results provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms involved
by copper in triggering angiogenesis and tumor progression. Our data broaden the
therapeutic potential of copper chelating agents against tumor angiogenesis and
progression.

INTRODUCTION

18 to 31 µM [7], while serum copper levels have been
found in cancer patients from 50 µM to 205 µM or even
at mM concentrations [8-10]. Of note, elevated copper
concentrations were correlated with cancer stage and/or
progression in diverse types of tumors, thus suggesting
that copper may be a useful prognostic factor and a marker
of responsiveness to therapy [reviewed in 8]. On the
basis of these findings, a number of studies investigated
the stimulatory action of copper on VEGF production
and tumor angiogenesis [11-13] and the repressive
effects exerted by copper-chelating on HIF-1α mediated
expression of VEGF [14, 15].
Numerous G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)
contribute to the angiogenic switch through mechanisms
that include their functional interaction with HIF-1α
toward VEGF expression [16]. In this regard, our recent
study has shown that the G protein estrogen receptor
(GPER) cooperates with HIF-1α in order to modulate

Copper, which is an essential trace element naturally
occurring in soil, water and air, acts as a catalytic and/or
structural cofactor in a wide array of important biological
processes like embryogenesis, growth, homeostasis and
angiogenesis [1, 2]. An elevated exposure to copper
may be mainly consequent to environmental pollution
from the manufacture of wire, sheet metal, pipe and
other metal products [2]. In addition, mining, waste
dumps, combustion of fossil fuels, wood production and
phosphate fertilizers release copper in the environment,
thus contributing to the actual exposure in humans [2-4].
To date, mismanaged or high copper levels have been
involved in the generation of oxidative stress [5] which
plays an important role in cancer development [6]. In
this regard, it should be mentioned that physiological
concentrations of copper range approximately from

VEGF in hypoxic breast tumor microenvironment [17].
In addition, we have demonstrated that estrogenic GPER
signalling activates HIF-1α/VEGF transduction pathway
leading to angiogenesis and tumor growth [18].
Here, we provide novel evidence on the mechanisms
by which copper triggers the EGFR/ERK/c-fos signalling
cascade along with GPER and HIF-1α toward VEGF
expression and function in cancer cells. We also show
that GPER may be considered as an additional target of
copper chelating agents, hence broadening the therapeutic
potential of these chemicals against tumor angiogenesis
and progression.

Collectively, these findings suggest that CuSO4
may be involved in the activation of HIF-1α/VEGF
transduction signalling in cancer cells. On the basis of
our recent findings suggesting that a functional crosstalk between HIF-1α and GPER may occur toward the
VEGF expression in hypoxic conditions [24, 17-18], we
next determined that the up-regulation of GPER mRNA
expression induced by CuSO4 in SkBr3 and HepG2 cells
(Figure 3A, 3B) is abolished in the presence of both TEPA
and NAC (Figure 3C). Moreover, the transactivation of
a GPER promoter construct triggered by CuSO4 was
prevented using TEPA and NAC (Figure 3D). Notably,
the GPER mRNA induction and the GPER promoter
transactivation induced by CoCl2 were prevented in the
presence of TEPA and rescued adding CuSO4 (Figure
3E, 3F). Results comparable to those observed upon
CoCl2 treatment were obtained culturing cells in a low
oxygen tension (2 % O2) (Supplementary Figure 1D-1E).
Cumulatively, these data recall previous studies showing
that the inhibitory effects of TEPA on hypoxia-induced
responses are rescued by CuSO4 in a dose-dependent
manner [14].
Altogether, these data indicate that GPER may be
included among the transduction mediators triggered by
copper, in particular in stressful conditions characterized
by a low oxygen tension in cancer cells.

RESULTS
CuSO4 induces the expression of the proangiogenic factor VEGF
Considering that copper and its chelating agents
have been involved in tumor angiogenesis [5], we
asked whether copper sulfate (CuSO4) may induce the
expression of the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF and its
transcriptional regulator HIF-1α in SkBr3 breast cancer
cells and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Of note,
CuSO4 induced the mRNA expression of both HIF-1α
(Figure 1A) and VEGF (Figure 1B) in a dose dependent
manner, starting from 25 µM and reaching the strongest
stimulation upon concentrations ranging from 100 to 200
µM. Taking into account these results and considering
that in previous studies relevant biological responses to
copper exposure were observed up to 500 µM [19-21], in
the subsequent assays of the current study 200 µM CuSO4
were used. First, we determined that CuSO4 up-regulates
in a time-dependent manner the mRNA expression of
HIF-1α (Figure 1C) and VEGF (Figure 1D) in SkBr3
and HepG2 cells. Thereafter, we ascertained that the
well-acknowledged copper chelating agent TEPA [14,
22] as well as the extensively used ROS scavenger NAC
[reviewed in 23] prevent the mRNA induction of HIF-1α
(Figure 1E) and VEGF (Figure 1F) and the transactivation
of a VEGF promoter construct (Figure 1G) upon treatment
with CuSO4. As copper has been previously involved in
HIF-1α responses to low oxygen conditions [14, 15],
we then assessed the effect of TEPA on the action of the
hypoxia-mimetic agent CoCl2. As expected, CoCl2 induced
the mRNA expression of HIF-1α (Figure 2A) and VEGF
(Figure 2B) as well as the transactivation of a VEGF
promoter construct (Figure 2C) in SkBr3 and HepG2 cells.
Interestingly, these effects were abolished in the presence
of TEPA and rescued adding CuSO4 to SkBr3 and HepG2
cells (Figure 2). Results similar to those observed using
CoCl2 were obtained culturing SkBr3 and HepG2 cells in
a low oxygen tension (2% O2) (Supplementary Figure 1A1C).

Molecular mechanisms involved in the stimulatory
actions elicited by CuSO4
As c-fos expression is a molecular sensor of
both GPER and HIF-1α signalling [18, 25-26], we also
demonstrated that c-fos mRNA increase upon CuSO4
stimulation (Figure 3G, 3H) is abrogated in the presence
of TEPA and NAC (Figure 3I). Nicely fitting with these
results, the transactivation of a c-fos luciferase construct
and AP1-luc promoter sequence induced by CuSO4 was
repressed in the presence of TEPA and NAC (Figure 3J).
Recapitulating the aforementioned findings, the protein
induction of c-fos, HIF-1α and GPER observed upon
CuSO4 treatment was abrogated in the presence of TEPA
and NAC in SkBr3 and HepG2 cells (Figure 4A-4D).
Given that the activation of EGFR/ERK signalling triggers
transduction mechanisms leading to gene expression
changes as mentioned above [17-18, 25, 27-28], we
ascertained that the EGFR and ERK1/2 phosphorylation
induced by CuSO4 in both SkBr3 and HepG2 cells (Figure
5A, 5B) is blocked in the presence of the EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitor AG1478 (AG) and the MEK inhibitor
PD98059 (PD) (Figure 5C, 5D) as well as using TEPA
and NAC (Figure 5E, 5F). Further corroborating these
data, the up-regulation of c-fos, HIF-1α, GPER and
VEGF mRNA expression (Figure 6A-6D) as well as the
transactivation of fos-luc, AP1-luc, GPER-luc and VEGFluc reporter constructs (Figure 6E, 6F) induced by CuSO4

were abolished in the presence of AG and PD. Analogous
findings were obtained evaluating the regulation of c-fos,
HIF-1α and GPER protein expression in SkBr3 and
HepG2 cells (Figure 6G, 6H).
Immunofluorescence experiments performed
in SkBr3 cells showed that TEPA, NAC, AG and PD
prevent also the increase of VEGF protein expression
upon CuSO4 treatment (Figure 7). In addition, the HIF1α protein increase triggered by CuSO4 was no longer
evident transfecting SkBr3 and HepG2 cells with a
plasmid encoding a dominant/negative c-fos mutant
(DN/c-fos) (Figure 8A, 8B). In accordance with the
aforementioned results, the up-regulation of GPER
(Figure 8A, 8B) and VEGF (Figure 8C, 8D) protein levels

upon CuSO4 treatment was prevented by DN/c-fos, as
evaluated by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence
assays, respectively. As demonstrated in our previous
investigations, in hypoxic tumor microenvironment HIF1α mediates the expression of GPER that contributes to
the regulation and function of VEGF [17, 24]. Likewise,
we found that the GPER protein up-regulation induced
by CuSO4 as well as the transactivation of the GPER
promoter were abolished knocking down HIF-1α
expression (Figure 9A-9F). In addition, the silencing of
HIF-1α prevented the CuSO4-induced activation of the
VEGF promoter construct (Figure 9G, 9H) as well as the
up-regulation of VEGF protein expression (Figure 9I-9K).
Of note, GPER was required for VEGF protein induction

CuSO4, we assessed in HUVECs the involvement of HIF1α and GPER in the formation of tubule-like structures
that represent a useful experimental model of angiogenic
process [29]. Interestingly, a ramified network of tubules
was generated in HUVECs cultured in conditioned
medium from CuSO4-treated SkBr3 cells (Figure 11A).
However this effect was prevented by knocking down
the expression of HIF-1α or GPER (Figure 11B-11H).
The addition of VEGF to the medium collected from
CuSO4-treated and GPER-silenced SkBr3 cells rescued
the generation of tubule structures in HUVECs (Figure
11C). Figure 11 (panels D-F) recapitulates these results,
suggesting that VEGF may be considered as a target of
copper-activated HIF-1α/GPER signalling toward new
blood vessels formation. As in previous studies VEGF
boosted endothelial cells migration [30-31] we then
evaluated whether HIF-1α and GPER are involved in the
migration of HUVECs. Conditioned medium from SkBr3
cells exposed to CuSO4 induced the migration of HUVECs
(Figure 12A), however this response was abrogated
silencing HIF-1α and GPER expression (Figure 12B-12E).
Indeed, the addition of VEGF rescued cell migration

culturing HUVECs in medium collected from SkBr3
cells which were GPER-silenced and treated with CuSO4
(Figure 12C). Next, we determined that HIF-1α and
GPER are required for SkBr3 cell proliferation induced
by CuSO4, as this response was prevented knocking-down
their expression (Supplementary Figure S2A-C). Likewise,
the growth effects elicited by CuSO4 was abolished in
the presence of TEPA (Supplementary Figure S2D).
Altogether, these findings suggest that copper may trigger
relevant biological actions through HIF-1α/GPER/VEGF
transduction signalling in both cancer and endothelial cells
toward angiogenesis and tumor progression.

DISCUSSION
The present study provides novel evidence regarding
the molecular mechanisms by which copper may trigger
the expression and function of VEGF toward angiogenesis
and tumor progression. In particular, we have shown
that copper activates the EGFR/ERK/c-fos transduction
pathway leading to the expression of HIF-1α, GPER and
VEGF in breast and hepatic cancer cells. In this regard,

of 200 µM. Hence, the last amount was used in all assays
to better evaluate the potential of copper to activate the
aforementioned biological activity. Previous studies have
disclosed that certain effects elicited by copper in cancer
cells rely on the generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), which act as second messenger in triggering
stimulatory signals [8]. In this regard, it has been shown
the transduction mechanisms involved, that include the
activation of the EGFR/ERK pathway and the expression
of genes mediating growth responses like c-fos [reviewed
in 5]. On the basis of these observations, it could be argued
that copper may mimic some biological features which
characterize the hypoxic tumor environment.
HIF-1 acts as a survival factor upon low oxygen
conditions regulating the expression of genes involved

in cell metabolism, migration, invasion and angiogenesis
[34-35]. In this vein, it is worth mentioning that copper
was shown to increase HIF-1α stabilization and
accumulation [19]. Further extending these findings, our
current results indicate that copper is also able to induce
HIF-1α expression, thus providing a new mechanism
through which this chemical may be involved in cancer
progression. Previous studies have determined that GPER
contributes together with HIF-1α to the adaptive responses
to hypoxic tumor microenvironment [17, 24]. Nicely fitting
with these observations, the present data reveal that copper
induces the expression of GPER through HIF-1α, leading
to the regulation of VEGF in breast cancer cells and cancer
associated fibroblasts (CAFs) [17]. The stimulatory role
of copper in cancer development has been also proved
by copper chelating agents as a reduction in tumor
volume, vascular permeability, tumor’s microvascular
supply and micrometastasis generation has been reported

lowering copper levels in diverse experimental models
[5]. Extending the current knowledge on the action of
anti-copper drugs like TEPA, our data indicate that these
chemicals may also target HIF-1α/GPER signalling among
the multifaceted responses triggered in cancer cells.
To date, the expression of GPER has been associated
with negative clinical features and poor survival rates
in a variety of tumors [36-38]. Consequently, huge
efforts are currently underway to better understand the
mechanisms involved in the regulation of GPER [28, 3958] which belongs to the GPCRs family widely involved
in cancer progression [59, 60]. Of note, several studies
have demonstrated that estrogenic GPER signalling
mediates relevant biological effects like proliferation and
migration in cancer cells and CAFs [61-63] that are largely
acknowledged to contribute to tumor cell metabolism and
disease progression [64-66]. In this regard, additional
investigations are needed to determine whether copper
could be also able to activate GPER signalling in a direct
manner, as previously demonstrated using other metals
[67].
Here, we have provided novel evidence regarding
the action elicited by copper toward tumor angiogenesis
and progression. On the basis of the present findings
GPER may be included together with HIF-1α and VEGF
among the molecular targets of copper chelating agents
in combination therapies. Nevertheless, further studies
are needed to better define the role of copper on the
functional interaction between GPER, HIF-1α and VEGF
in malignant cells and tumor microenvironment.

system is suitable to ascertain the contribution of GPER
to copper action toward tumor angiogenesis.
The SkBr3 breast cancer cells were maintained in
RPMI-1640 (Life Technologies, Milan, Italy) without
phenol red, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin.
The hepatocarcinoma cells HepG2 were cultured in
DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium) (Life

with the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega, Milan, Italy)
normalized to the internal transfection control provided
by Renilla luciferase activity. The normalized relative light
unit values obtained from cells treated with vehicle were
set as 1-fold induction, upon which the activity induced by
treatments was calculated.

Cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes and prior
to treatments cells were transfected for 24 hours using
X-treme GENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche
Diagnostics, Milan, Italy) with a control shRNA, shHIF1α, shGPER, a control vector and the plasmid DN/c-fos,
encoding a c-fos mutant that heterodimerizes with c-fos
dimerization partners but not allowing DNA binding
(kindly obtained from Dr. C. Vinson, NIH, Bethesda, MD,
USA). The HIF-1α shRNA and the respective control
plasmid were purchased from SABioscience Corporation

was obtained by the construct which we have previously
described and used [68].

Gene expression studies
Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures using
the TRIzol commercial kit (Life Technologies, Milan,
Italy) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA
was quantified spectrophotometrically and quality was
checked by electrophoresis through agarose gels stained
with ethidium bromide. Only samples that were not
degraded and showed clear 18 and 28 S bands under
UV light were used for RT-PCR. Total cDNA was
synthesized from the RNA by reverse transcription as
previously described [17]. The expression of selected
genes was quantified by real-time PCR using Step One
(TM)
sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems Inc,
Milan, Italy), following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Gene-specific primers were designed using Primer

Immunofluorescence assay
Fifty percent confluent cultured SkBr3 cells grown
on coverslips were serum deprived and then treated for
12 hours with CuSO4 alone and in combination with
TEPA, NAC, AG1478 and PD98059, as indicated. Where
required, cells previously transfected for 24 h with shHIF1α or shGPER and respective negative control plasmids
(as described above) and then treated for 18 hours with
CuSO4, Then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed three
times with PBS and incubated overnight with a mouse
primary antibody against VEGF (C-1) (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, DBA, Milan, Italy). After incubation, the
slides were extensively washed with PBS and incubated
with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride
(DAPI), (1:1000), (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and
donkey anti-mouse IgG-FITC (1:300; purchased from
Alexa Fluor, Life Technologies, Milan, Italy). The slides
were imaged on the Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multimode
reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) and analysed using the
software Gen5 (BioTek, Winooski, VT).

Conditioned medium

Western blot analysis

SkBr3 cells were cultured in regular growth
medium, then cells were washed twice with PBS and
transfected for 24 hours in serum-free RPMI-1640 with
shHIF-1α, shGPER or control shRNA using X-treme
GENE 9 DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics,
Milan, Italy). Cells were treated for 18 hours with CuSO4,
culture medium was then replaced for additional 18 hours
with medium without serum. Thereafter, the supernatants
were collected, centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 5 minutes to
remove cell debris and used as conditioned medium in
HUVECs.

SkBr3 and HepG2 cells were processed according
to the previously described protocol [17] to obtain protein
lysate that was electrophoresed through a reducing
SDS/10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted onto
a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with primary
antibodies against HIF-1α (R&D Systems, Inc. Celbio,
Milan, Italy), GPER (N-15), c-fos (H-125), phosphorylated

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING

The day before the experiment, confluent HUVECs
were starved overnight at 37 °C in serum free medium
(EBM, Lonza, Milan, Italy). Growth factor-reduced
Matrigel® (Cultrex, Trevigen Inc, USA) was thawed
overnight at 4 °C on ice, plated on the bottom of prechilled
96well-plates and left at 37°C for 1 h for gelification.
Starved HUVECs were collected by enzymatic detachment
(0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution, Life Technologies, Milan,
Italy), counted and resuspended in conditioned medium
from CAFs. Then, 10,000 cells/well were seeded on
Matrigel and incubated at 37 °C. Tube formation was
observed starting from 2 h after cell seeding and quantified
by using the software NIH ImageJ (National Institutes of
Health (NIH), Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, USA)
