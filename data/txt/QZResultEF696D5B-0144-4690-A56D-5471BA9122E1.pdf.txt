ABSTRACT
Celastrol, a triterpene extracted from the Chinese “Thunder of God Vine”, is
known to have anticancer activity, but its underlying mechanism is not completely
understood. In this study, we show that celastrol kills several breast and colon
cancer cell lines by induction of paraptosis, a cell death mode characterized by
extensive vacuolization that arises via dilation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
mitochondria. Celastrol treatment markedly increased mitochondrial Ca2+ levels and
induced ER stress via proteasome inhibition in these cells. Both MCU (mitochondrial
Ca2+ uniporter) knockdown and pretreatment with ruthenium red, an inhibitor of MCU,
inhibited celastrol-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, dilation of mitochondria/ER,
accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, and cell death in MDA-MB 435S cells.
Inhibition of the IP3 receptor (IP3R) with 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) also
effectively blocked celastrol-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and subsequent
paraptotic events. Collectively, our results show that the IP3R-mediated release of
Ca2+ from the ER and its subsequent MCU-mediated influx into mitochondria critically
contribute to celastrol-induced paraptosis in cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION

to inhibit proliferation and suppress the initiation,
progression and metastasis of tumors in a wide variety of
models in vitro and in vivo [11-14]. To date, the studies on
the cancer-killing activity of celastrol have mainly focused
on its ability to induce apoptosis [15,16]. In the present
study, in contrast, we show that celastrol kills breast and
colon cancer cell lines via inducing paraptosis. Despite
recent improvements in anti-cancer therapies, inherent
or acquired cellular resistance to various pro-apoptotic
treatments often leads to therapeutic failure [17]. Thus,
a better understanding of alternative, non-apoptotic cell
death pathways, including paraptosis, may facilitate the
design of novel therapeutics against malignant cancer
cells that harbor defective apoptotic machineries. The
term “paraptosis” was originally introduced to describe a
form of programmed cell death that is morphologically

Celastrol, a quinone methide triterpene, is a
pharmacologically active compound derived from the
Chinese medicinal plant, Tripterygium wilfordii [1].
Two carbons of celastrol, C2 of the A-ring and C6 of the
B-ring (Figure 1A), reportedly show high susceptibilities
for nucleophilic attack [2]. Celastrol can react with the
nucleophilic thiol groups of cysteine residues and form
covalent Michael adducts [3-6]. This seems to be the
major mechanism through which celastrol can alter the
functions of various proteins. Celastrol has traditionally
been used to treat autoimmune diseases [7], chronic
inflammation [8], asthma [9], and neurodegenerative
diseases [10]. More recently, it has attracted interest as
a potential anti-cancer agent, since it has been shown

and biochemically distinct from apoptosis [18,19]. It is
characterized by: extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization that
arises via swelling of the ER [19-21] and/or mitochondria
[19,21,22]; the lack of characteristic apoptotic features,
such as pyknosis, DNA fragmentation and caspase
activation [19,21,23]; insensitivity to caspase inhibitors
[18,24]; and overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like
proteins [18,21,24]. Therefore, identification of agents
that can induce paraptosis by targeting both mitochondria
and the ER may provide a rational therapeutic strategy
for effectively killing malignant cancer cells that
resist apoptosis. However, the mechanisms underlying
paraptosis, particularly the signals responsible for
triggering dilation of mitochondria and the ER are still
poorly defined. Observations that paraptosis can be
inhibited by cycloheximide indicate that the paraptotic
process requires protein synthesis [19,21,22,25]. MAP
kinase activation has been associated with paraptosis
induced by insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGFIR)
[18], curcumin [21,22], celastrol [25], and taxol [26],

although the importance of the respective MAP kinase
differs depending on the stimulus [18,21,22,25,26]. We
recently showed that proteasomal dysfunction and the
generation of mitochondrial superoxide are critical for
the curcumin-induced dilation of mitochondria/ER and
subsequent paraptotic cell death in breast cancer cells
[21]. We propose here that the IP3R-mediated release of
Ca2+ from the ER and its subsequent mitochondrial Ca2+
uniporter-mediated influx into mitochondria may critically
contribute to extensive dilation of mitochondria and the
ER, leading to celastrol-induced paraptotic cell death.

RESULTS
Neither apoptosis nor autophagy is critically
involved in celastrol-induced cancer cell death
To investigate the anti-cancer effects of celastrol,
we treated two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB 435S

Figure 1: Apoptosis is not critically involved in the celastrol-induced cancer cell death. (A) The chemical structure of

celastrol. (B) Two breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB 435S and MCF-7) and two colon cancer cell lines (DLD-1 and RKO) were treated
with celastrol at the indicated concentrations for 24 h. Cellular viability was assessed using calcein-AM and EthD-1 to detect live and
dead cells, respectively. (C) MDA-MB 435S cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of z-VAD-fmk for 30 min and further
treated with 0.2 μg/ml TRAIL or 2 μM celastrol for 24 h. Cellular viability was assessed using calcein-AM and EthD-1. (D) MDA-MB
435S cells were treated with 0.2 μg/ml TRAIL for 24 h or 2 μM celastrol for the indicated time points. Whole cell extracts were prepared
from the treated cells and subjected to Western blotting. β-actin was used as a loading control in Western blots. The fold change of protein
levels compared to control (untreated cells) was determined by a densitometric analysis. (E) Cells were pretreated with the indicated
concentrations of z-VAD-fmk for 30 min and further treated with or without 2 μM celastrol for 24 h. Cellular viability was assessed using

and MCF-7) and two colon cancer cell lines (DLD-1
and RKO) with various doses of celastrol for 24 h and
performed cell viability assays using calcein-AM and
EthD-1 to detect live and dead cells, respectively. We
found that celastrol dose-dependently increased cell death
over a range of 1-3 μM (Figure 1B). To test whether
celastrol kills these cancer cells via apoptosis, we used the
tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL), a cytokine that induces apoptosis by binding
to the death receptors DR4 and DR5 [27] as a positive
control. Treatment of MDA-MB 435S cells for 24 h with
the apoptosis inducer TRAIL (0.2 μg/ml) effectively
induced cell death (Figure 1C) in association with the
effective proteolytic cleavage of caspase-8, -9, and -3
(Figure 1D). Pretreatment with z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase
inhibitor, almost completely blocked TRAIL-induced cell
death, but not celastrol-induced cell death in these cells
(Figure 1C). Consistent with this, celastrol treatment was
not accompanied by detectable proteolytic processing
of cspase-8 or -9, except the minimal expression of p20
intermediate form of caspase-3 (Figure 1D). Furthermore,
z-VAD-fmk pretreatment did not significantly inhibit
celastrol-induced cell death in MCF-7 and DLD-1 cells,
although it slightly attenuated cell death in RKO cells
(Figure 1E). Moreover, chromatin condensation, DNA
fragmentation, and PARP cleavage were frequently
observed in MDA-MB 435S cells treated with TRAIL,
as revealed by DAPI staining and immunostaining for
cleaved PARP, but not in cells treated with celastrol
(Supplementary Figure 1A). Immunocytochemical
analysis further revealed that TRAIL induced the release
of mitochondrial cytochrome c, whereas celastrol did not
(Supplementary Figure 1B). Taken together, these results
indicate that apoptosis may not critically contribute to the
cytotoxicity of celastrol toward the tested cancer cell lines.
When we examined the cellular morphologies
following celastrol treatment, we found that marked
cellular vacuolation commonly preceded cell death in
MDA-MB 435S, MCF-7, DLD-1 and RKO cells (Figure
2A). Therefore, we examined whether celastrol-induced
vacuolation and subsequent cell death were associated with
autophagy. First, we tested the possibility that celastrol
induces lysosomal activation, a late step in autophagy, by
staining with LysoTracker-Red. Treatment of MDA-MB
435S cells with Torin1, an autophagy inducer with mTOR
(mechanistic target of rapamycin) inhibitory activity [28],
markedly increased LysoTracker-Red staining, whereas
bafilomycin A1, an autophagy inhibitor, substantially
reduced it (Figure 2B). Interestingly, celastrol treatment,
like bafilomycin A1 treatment, also inhibited LysoTrackerRed staining. We further measured autophagic flux
activity in MDA-MB 435S cells employing the tandem
fluorescent construct, mRFP/GFP-LC3 [29]. In this
assay, RFP fluorescence is relatively stable in acidic
compartments, whereas GFP fluorescence is rapidly
quenched in such environments. Accordingly, mRFP/

GFP-LC3 in mature autolysosomes will be detected as
red puncta, whereas blocking autophagosome-lysosome
fusion or suppressing lysosomal degradation (i.e., through
an increase in lysosomal pH) will increase the number
of yellow puncta [29]. We found that celastrol treatment
increased the number of yellow puncta (RFP(+)/GFP(+)LC3) similar to bafilomycin A1 treatment, whereas Torin1
treatment increased red puncta (RFP(+)/GFP(-)-LC3
puncta) (Figure 3A-3C). Time-course experiments showed
that LC3 (both I and II form), as well as p62 [30] and
NBR1 (Neighbor of Braca1 gene) [31], the substrates of
autophagy, progressively accumulated in both MDA-MB
435S and MCF-7 cells treated with celastrol, similar to
those obtained with bafilomycin A1 treatment (Figure
3D). Also similar to bafilomycin A1 treatment, celastrol
inhibited the proteolytic processing of cathepsin L, a
major lysosomal protease. These results would seem to
suggest that celastrol might inhibit autophagy, possibly
at the lysosomal step. However, we found that neither
celastrol-induced cell death nor cellular vacuolation was
affected not only by pretreatment with the autophagy
inhibitors, 3-MA, bafilomycin A1, and chloroquine
(CQ) but also by knockdown of ATG5, Beclin-1 and
LAMP2 (Supplementary Figure 2A-2D). Furthermore,
celastrol-induced cell death was not affected by the
pretreatment with necrostatin-1, an inhibitor of necroptosis
(Supplementary Figure 2E and 2F). Collectively, these
results suggest that celastrol-induced vacuolation and
subsequent cell death in MDA-MB 435S cells do not
involve modulation of autophagy or necroptosis.

Celastrol induces paraptosis in MDA-MB 435S
cells
Next, to test whether the celastrol-induced vacuoles
might originate from mitochondria and/or the ER, we used
MDA-MB 435S sublines stably expressing fluorescence
selectively in mitochondria or the ER, YFP-Mito cells and
YFP-ER cells [21]. As shown in Figure 4A, mitochondria
in untreated YFP-Mito cells exhibited a filamentous,
elongated morphology, whereas the ER in untreated
YFP-ER cells formed a reticulate structure. At 3 h after
treatment with 2 μM celastrol, numerous fluorescent
vacuoles were observed in both YFP-Mito and YFP-ER
cells. Immunocytochemistry using specific antibodies
against the subunit A of succinate dehydrogenase (SDHA),
a mitochondrial protein, and protein disulfide-isomerase
(PDI), an ER-resident protein, showed many small rings
of SDHA expression and larger rings of PDI expression
in MDA-MB 435S cells treated with celastrol for 3 h
(Figure 4B). A more detailed electron microscopy revealed
swollen mitochondria and the ER structures in MDA-MB
435S cells treated with 2 μM celastrol for 3 h. At 6 h of
celastrol treatment, fusion among swollen mitochondria
and the swollen ER had further progressed (Figure 4C).

In contrast, untreated MDA-MB 435S cells possessed
mitochondria with intact cristae and the ER structures
with a reticular morphology. Collectively, these results
indicate that celastrol induces paraptotic morphologies.
We next sought biochemical evidence for the induction
of paraptosis by celastrol. We first tested the effect of the
protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, on celastrolinduced cell death. Pretreatment with cycloheximide
(CHX) very effectively blocked cell death in celastroltreated MDA-MB 435S cells (Figure 5A), and prevented
mitochondrial/ER dilation in celastrol-treated YFP-Mito
and YFP-ER cells (Figure 5B). Recently, we showed
that proteasome dysfunction is required for dilation of
mitochondria/ER and consequent paraptotic cell death
[21,22]. Thus, we asked whether celastrol also impairs
proteasome activity. We found that celastrol-treated cells
progressively accumulated poly-ubiquitinated proteins
(Figure 5C). Furthermore, celastrol treatment markedly
increased the protein levels of ATF4, CHOP, and KDEL in

MDA-MB 435S and MCF-7 cells, indicating that celastrol
induces ER stress. When we examined the activity changes
in MAP kinases, we found that ERKs were progressively
activated in MDA-MB 435S cells treated with celastrol. In
contrast, the activities of ERKs increased with a peak at 2
h of celastrol treatment and then slowly reduced in MCF7 cells (Figure 5D). In both MDA-MB 435S and MCF7 cells, JNKs demonstrated biphasic activation patterns
following celastrol treatment, whereas p38 showed
transient activation with a peak at 2 h after celastrol
treatment. When we investigated the importance of these
signals, we found that celastrol-induced cell death was
significantly inhibited by SP600125-induced inhibition of
JNK, inhibited by PD98059-induced inhibition of ERK
at lesser extent, and unaffected by SB203580-induced
inhibition of p38 (Figure 5E). Taken together, our results
indicate that celastrol may induce paraptosis in the tested
breast cancer cell lines.

IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release and uniportermediated mitochondrial influx of Ca2+ are critical
for celastrol-induced paraptosis

in mitochondria of YFP-Mito cells (Figure 6C). Moreover,
flow cytometry using Rhod-2 showed that the celastrolinduced increase in [Ca2+]m is common to MCF-7, DLD-1,
and RKO cells (Figure 6D).
Ca2+ reportedly enters mitochondria via the MCU
when [Ca2+]i are high [32]. Thus, we next tested whether
inhibition of MCU affected celastrol-induced paraptosis.
The functional role of the MCU in celastrol-induced cell
death was investigated by knocking it down using small
interfering RNA. We found that the cell death in YFPMito cells induced by 2 μM celastrol was significantly
attenuated by transfection with MCU siRNA, despite the
incomplete knockdown of MCU (Figure 7A). In addition,
FACS analysis and fluorescence microscopy using Rhod-2
in these cells showed that mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation
and cellular vacuolation induced by treatment with 2 μM
celastrol for 2 h were also markedly reduced by MCU
knockdown (Figures 7B and 7C). Pretreatment with
ruthenium red (RR), an inhibitor of uniporter-mediated

Since mitochondria and the ER are major reservoirs
of intracellular Ca2+, we next tested whether their
dilation following celastrol treatment was associated
with disruptions in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Flow
cytometry using Fluo-3 (a cell-permeable Ca2+-indicator
dye) demonstrated that treatment of MDA-MB 435S cells
with celastrol dramatically increased the intracellular
Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]i), which peaked at 3 h post-treatment
(Figure 6A). Furthermore, flow cytometry using Rhod2 (an indicator dye for mitochondrial Ca2+) showed that
celastrol treatment also increased the mitochondrial
Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+]m), which peaked at 2 h post-treatment
(Figure 6B). Fluorescence microscopy further confirmed
the celastrol-induced increase in Rhod-2 staining intensity

mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake [33,34], also effectively
blocked the celastrol-induced increase in [Ca2+]m in
YFP-Mito cells (Figure 8A) and celastrol-induced death
of MDA-MB 435S cells (Figure 8B). RR pretreatment
also inhibited the dilation of mitochondria and the ER in
YFP-Mito and YFP-ER cells (Figure 8C). Furthermore,
RR pretreatment markedly inhibited celastrol-induced
the accumulations of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, CHOP,
activated ERK, and activated JNK (Figure 8D). We further
tested whether treatment with kaempferol, an activator
of the MCU [35], could sensitize MDA-MB 435S cells
treated with the low-dose celastrol to paraptotic cell
death. Compared to treatment with subtoxic dose (20
μM) of kaempferol or low-dose (1 μM) celastrol alone,
combined treatment with kaempferol and celastrol for 4
h markedly increased [Ca2+]m and cellular vacuolation in
YFP-Mito cells (Supplementary Figure 3A). In addition,
co-treatment with kaempferol dose-dependently enhanced
the death of MDA-MB 435S cells treated with 1 μM
celastrol, compared with cells treated with 1 μM celastrol
alone (Supplementary Figure 3B). Collectively, these
observations indicate that MCU-mediated mitochondrial
Ca2+ uptake may play a critical role in celastrol-induced
paraptosis.
Next, we assessed the contribution of extracellular
Ca2+ and intracellular Ca2+ stores to celastrol-induced
mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation. Since pretreatment
with extracellular Ca2+ chelators, including EGTA or

BAPTA, did not appear to alter celastrol-induced cell
death (Figure 9A), we tested whether Ca2+ release from
the ER contributed to celastrol-induced paraptosis.
Experiments using specific inhibitors of two major Ca2+
release receptors in the ER, the IP3 receptor (IP3R) and
the ryanodine receptor (RyR) [36], showed that celastrolinduced cell death was very effectively inhibited by
2-APB, a specific inhibitor of IP3R [37], but not by
dantrolene, a specific inhibitor of the RyR [38] (Figure 9A).
Staining of YFP-Mito cells with Rhod-2 also showed that
2-APB markedly reduced the celastrol-induced increase
in [Ca2+]m (Figure 9B). Furthermore, 2-APB effectively
inhibits celastrol-induced dilation of mitochondria and
the ER in YFP-Mito and YFP-ER cells, respectively
(Figure 9C). These results suggest that pretreatment with
2-APB effectively inhibits the celastrol-induced cell
death by inhibiting the IP3R-mediated release of Ca2+
from the ER and the subsequent MCU-mediated influx of
Ca2+ into mitochondria. In addition, 2-APB pretreatment
markedly inhibited celastrol-induced the accumulations
of poly-ubiquitinated proteins, CHOP, activated ERK,
and activated JNK (Figure 9D). The importance of IP3Rmediated Ca2+ release from the ER in celastrol-induced
paraptosis was further tested using adenophostin A, an
agonist of IP3R [39]. We found that co-treatment of MDAMB 435S cells with adenophostin A dose-dependently
enhanced cell death, when combined with 2 μM celastrol
(Figure 9E). Fluorescence microscopy using Rhod-2

showed that co-treatment with 10 μM adenophostin A
accelerated and enhanced celastrol-induced increase in
[Ca2+]m in cells treated with 2 μM celastrol (Supplementary
Figure 4). Notably, the levels of IP3R and MCU protein
increased following celastrol treatment (Figure 9F) and
similar to celastrol, MG132 or bortezomib also increased
IP3R and MCU protein levels in MDA-MB 435S cells
(Figure 9F). These results suggest that the upregulation
of IP3R and MCU as a consequence of celastrol-induced
proteasome inhibition may contribute to the release of Ca2+
from the ER, Ca2+ influx into mitochondria, and subsequent
paraptotic events. Finally, we found that pretreatment with
RR or 2-APB significantly and dose-dependently inhibited
celastrol-induced cell death also in MCF-7, DLD-1, and
RKO cells (Figure 10A). In sum, we herein show for the
first time that celastrol-induced paraptotic cell death in
cancer cells is triggered by IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release

from the ER and uniporter-mediated mitochondrial Ca2+
influx which collectively trigger dilation of mitochondria
and the ER (Figure 10B).

DISCUSSION
Accumulating evidence suggests that although
the elimination of malignant cancer cells often depends
on classical apoptotic pathways (mitochondrial and/or
death-receptor pathways), alternative apoptotic and nonapoptotic pathways may effectively contribute to tumor
cell death. In addition, researchers have speculated that
the relative sensitivity of mitochondria/ER in cancer cells
to oxidative stress and ER stress, compared to normal
cells, could be exploited for the rational design of cancer
therapeutics [40-43]. Thus, induction of paraptosis,
the cell death mode that targets both mitochondria and

determined by the fold changes of densitometric values in treated groups to the values in the control group. Densitometric values for the
phospho-proteins of interest were normalized for protein loading with their total proteins. The relative expression levels of CHOP and
ubiquitin were determined using densitometric analysis compared to untreated control.

the ER, may offer an attractive way to effectively kill
malignant cancer cells that are resistant to conventional
pro-apoptotic cancer therapies. In the present study, we
show that celastrol effectively kills MDA-MB 435S,
MCF-7, DLD-1, and RKO cancer cells via induction
of paraptosis. During celastrol-induced cell death,
autophagy was inhibited at lysosomal step and apoptosis
was minimally involved. Similar to our results, Boridy S
et al. showed that combination with autophagy inhibitor
did not sensitize cells to celastrol-mediated cytotoxicity
and celastrol-induced paraptosis in glioma cells occurred
independently of apoptosis [44]. In contrast, celastrol was
reported to induce paraptosis, autophagy, and apoptosis in
HeLa cells [25], suggesting the possibility that celastrol
may induce different cellular fates other than paraptosis,
depending on cell types or cellular context. Celastrol
treatment was found to induce extensive swelling and
fusion of mitochondria and the ER, eventually leading
to the formation of a few megamitochondria and
substantially expanded ER structures. Based on these
findings, we sought to decipher the key signals responsible
for the dilation of mitochondria and the ER during
celastrol-induced paraptosis. Here, we found that celastrol
induced marked accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated
proteins and various ER-stress marker proteins, including
ATF4, CHOP and KDEL. Cycloheximide pretreatment
almost completely blocked celastrol-induced vacuolation
and subsequent cell death, suggesting that protein
synthesis is required for the treatment-induced dilation of
mitochondria and the ER.
The ER and mitochondria interact both
physiologically and functionally, at least in part via
Ca2+ signaling [45]. Mitochondria are juxtaposed to the
ER in microdomains called mitochondria-associated
ER membranes (MAMs) [46]. This physical association
enables highly efficient inter-organelle communication,
allowing mitochondria to tightly couple and coordinate
Ca2+ fluxes with the ER and act as cellular sentinels
for the ER-mediated Ca2+ signals [47]. The loss of Ca2+
homeostasis (e.g., cellular Ca2+ overload) or changes
in Ca2+ distribution within intracellular compartments
can lead to cell death [48]. Thus, we examined whether
Ca2+ was involved in celastrol-induced mitochondria/ER
dilation and subsequent cell death. We found that celastrol
markedly increased [Ca2+]i, particularly [Ca2+]m, in our
tested cancer cells. While the physiological [Ca2+]m signal
regulates [Ca2+]c and stimulates oxidative metabolism,
excess mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation causes cell stress
to leading to cell death [49]. The MCU is a major Ca2+
entry pathway through the mitochondrial inner membrane
[50]. In our study, not only MCU knockdown but also RR
pretreatment inhibited celastrol-induced mitochondrial
Ca2+ accumulation, dilation of mitochondria and the ER,
and cell death. In addition, kaempferol, a MCU activator,
sensitized breast cancer cells treated with the low-dose
celastrol to paraptosis. Taken together, these results
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggest that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake via MCU plays a
critical role in celastrol-induced paraptosis.
An investigation of the source of Ca2+ responsible
for mitochondrial Ca2+ overload following celastrol
treatment showed that two extracellular Ca2+ chelators,
BAPTA and EGTA, failed to block celastrol-induced
cell death, suggesting the involvement of intracellular
stores. Under normal physiological conditions, the bulk
of Ca2+ resides within the ER lumen. The most important
molecular component of the Ca2+-handling machinery
in the ER is the IP3R, which mediates the release of
Ca2+ following binding of its ligand IP3 [36]. IP3Rs are
primarily clustered in MAM regions, which function as
the primary subcellular microdomains of Ca2+ transfer
from the ER to mitochondria [46]. In the present study,
following results support the importance of the IP3R in
celastrol-induced paraptosis: a) pretreatment of MDAMB 435S cells with 2-APB, an IP3R antagonist, inhibited
celastrol-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation,
mitochondrial and the ER dilation, and cell death; b)
co-treatment with adenophostin A potentiated celastrolinduced mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and cell death;
c) celastrol treatment increased IP3R protein levels.
Although 2-APB was initially characterized as an
antagonist of IP3Rs, increasing evidence has shown that
2-APB may be a powerful modifier of store-operated Ca2+
entry (SOCE) channels [51]. Low levels of 2-APB (1-10
μM) were shown to rapidly and profoundly stimulate Ca2+
entry, whereas higher levels of 2-APB (25-75 μM) induced
a transient increase followed by complete inhibition [52].
Therefore, we presume that SOCE may not be critically
involved in celastrol-induced paraptosis, since 10-20 μM
2-APB very effectively blocked the celastrol-induced
increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels and cell death. IP3Rs
are known to be polyubiquitinated, and it has been shown
that proteasome inhibitors block their down-regulation
[53]. In our study, celastrol increased the protein levels
of not only IP3R but also MCU, similar to MG132 and
bortezomib. Therefore, we speculate that upregulation
of both IP3R and MCU as a result of celastrol-induced
proteasome inhibition may contribute to the enhanced
release of Ca2+ from the ER and subsequent mitochondrial
Ca2+ influx.
The release of Ca2+ from the ER to the
mitochondria is considered to be the major event leading
to mitochondria swelling [54]. Our own unpublished
data indicate that treatment of breast cancer cells with
thapsigargin (an agent that reduces Ca2+ levels in the ER)
induces transient swelling of mitochondria, but not the
ER (data not shown). Giant ER-derived vacuoles have
been increasingly recognized as indicating perturbation of
the functional link between the ER and the proteasome
[22,55,56]. Enhanced accumulation of misfolded proteins
in cancer cells increases the dependence of cells on
optimal proteasomal function [57], and failure of the
proteasomal machinery leads to further accumulation
6826

of misfolded proteins in the ER and cytoplasm [58].
Although the mechanism underlying ER vacuolization has
not been extensively investigated, Mimnaugh et al. [55]
proposed that accumulation of misfolded proteins trapped
within the ER could exert an osmotic force, inducing
an influx of water from the cytoplasm and distending
the ER luminal space into vacuoles. Celastrol has the
potential to covalently modify sulfhydryl groups, causing
protein misfolding [6], as well as the ability to inhibit
proteasome activity [2]. Therefore, a massive buildup of
misfolded proteins within the ER lumen may critically
contribute to the ER vacuolization observed following
celastrol treatment. This hypothesis is supported by our
finding that the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide,
protects breast cancer cells from celastrol-induced dilation
of the ER and mitochondria and subsequent cell death.
The ER controls the synthesis, folding and processing
of proteins. Since a high concentration of Ca2+ in the ER
is essential to the function of chaperones [e.g., glucoseregulated protein (GRP) 78 [59] and the processing of
luminal proteins [60], depletion of ER Ca2+ levels will
trigger the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the
ER by impairing chaperone activity [59,61] and protein
processing [60]. Therefore, we speculate that the celastrolinduced release of ER Ca2+ via IP3R contributes to the
further accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER and
expansion of ER-derived vacuoles. This is supported by
our observation that 2-APB pretreatment inhibited the
celastrol-induced accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated
proteins, dilation of mitochondria and the ER, and
subsequent cell death. In addition, we cannot exclude the
possibility that mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+ by celastrol,
probably indirectly, may inhibit the proteasomal activity
and/or ER structure, since RR pretreatment also inhibited
the celastrol-induced accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated
proteins and dilation of the ER, besides the dilation of
mitochondria.
In sum, our results show that mitochondria and the
ER cooperate to signal celastrol-induced paraptosis via
Ca2+.
