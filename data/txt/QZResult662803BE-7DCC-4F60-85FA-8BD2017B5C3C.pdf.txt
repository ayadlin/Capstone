Abstract
Limited progress has been made in the treatment of advanced-stage pediatric solid tumors despite the
accelerated pace of cancer discovery over the last decade. Tyrosine kinase inhibition is one tractable
therapeutic modality for treating human malignancy. However, little is known about the kinases critical to
the development or maintenance of many pediatric solid tumors such as Ewing sarcoma. Using a ﬂuorescent,
bead-based technology to proﬁle activated tyrosine kinases, we identiﬁed focal adhesion kinase (FAK, PTK2)
as a candidate target in Ewing sarcoma. FAK is a tyrosine kinase critical for cellular adhesion, growth, and
survival. As such, it is a compelling target for cancer-based therapy. In this study, we have shown that FAK is
highly phosphorylated in primary Ewing sarcoma tumor samples and that downregulation of FAK by short
hairpin RNA and treatment with a FAK-selective kinase inhibitor, PF-562271, impaired growth and colony
formation in Ewing sarcoma cell lines. Moreover, treatment of Ewing sarcoma cell lines with PF-562271
induced apoptosis and led to downregulation of AKT/mTOR and CAS activity. Finally, we showed that smallmolecule inhibition of FAK attenuated Ewing sarcoma tumor growth in vivo. With FAK inhibitors currently in
early-phase clinical trials for adult malignancies, these ﬁndings may bear immediate relevance to patients
with Ewing sarcoma. Cancer Res; 73(9); 2873–83. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Pediatric solid tumors are frequently associated with
aberrant activation of transcription factors or loss of tumor
suppressor genes. Neither of these oncogenic mechanisms,
however, is readily druggable by traditional pharmacologic
approaches. Moreover, the sequencing of pediatric cancer
genomes is revealing remarkable stability with surprisingly
few additional genetic mechanisms of oncogenesis in these
diseases (1, 2). Thus, the search for new pediatric cancer
therapeutic targets may need to expand beyond next-generation DNA sequencing.
Targeting aberrantly activated tyrosine kinases is one
treatment approach that has had recent success in several

types of adult cancers. Selective kinase inhibitor therapy has
transformed the care of patients with BCR/ABL-positive
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML; ref. 3), EGF receptor
(EGFR)-mutated lung cancer (4), and c-KIT–mutated gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST; ref. 5). Over the last year,
the B-RAF inhibitor vemurafenib has been approved for
patients with B-RAFV600E mutant metastatic or inoperable
melanoma, and the ALK inhibitor crizotinib was approved
for patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK–positive non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In pediatric
solid tumors, clinical trials testing crizotinib for patients
with ALK mutations are ongoing (http://clinicaltrials.gov/;
NCT00939770). However, few genetically altered kinase targets in pediatric solid tumors have been identiﬁed despite
emerging data suggesting that activated kinases may play an
important role in the development and maintenance of these
diseases. For example, in the pediatric solid tumor Ewing
sarcoma, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) is
activated but not mutated, and clinical trials testing IGF1Rtargeting antibodies induced clinical responses in a subset of
patients with Ewing sarcoma (6, 7). More recently, high
levels of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) expression were
reported as a result of epigenetic deregulation in the pediatric retinal cancer retinoblastoma. SYK targeting with a
small-molecule inhibitor induced retinoblastoma cell death
in vitro and in vivo (2).
In this study, we chose to use a screening modality that
could rapidly identify highly activated kinases, agnostic to
mechanism, and targetable by available drugs. Therefore, we

leveraged a recently described, bead-based tyrosine kinase
activity assay that proﬁles the phosphorylation of a large panel
of tyrosine kinases, many of which have available inhibitors (8).
We focused on Ewing sarcoma, the second most common bone
tumor diagnosed in children, where survival remains poor for
patients with metastatic and recurrent disease despite intensive regimens (9, 10). New therapeutic approaches are needed
to improve the survival of patients with this disease. Using
kinase activity proﬁling, we evaluated the tyrosine kinase
landscape in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and identiﬁed focal
adhesion kinase (FAK/PTK2) as an actionable, highly activated
tyrosine kinase in this disease.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
A673, EW8, SKNEP, EWS834, and RDES cells were grown in
Dulbeccos' Modiﬁed Eagle's Media (DMEM; Mediatech) with
10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich). A673 medium was supplemented
with 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). TC71 and TC32
were grown in RPMI (Mediatech) with 10% FBS and TTC466,
EWS502, and CADO-ES-1 with 15% FBS. Cell lines were provided by Dr. Todd Golub (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA)
except for EWS502 and EWS834, which were a gift from Dr.
Jonathan Fletcher (Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston,
MA). All cell lines have unique genotypes and EWS/FLI
and EWS/ERG rearrangements were conﬁrmed by RNA
sequencing.
Protein extraction and immunoblotting
Whole-cell lysates were extracted in 1 Cell Lysis Buffer
(Cell Signaling) supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitors and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Western
immunoblotting was conducted using standard techniques.
Primary antibodies against total FAK, phospho-PYK2 (Y402),
total mTOR, phospho-mTOR (S2448), total S6, phospho-S6
(S240/244), total AKT, phospho-AKT (S473), PARP, total ERK,
phospho-ERK (T202/Y204), phospho-CAS (Y410), and total
SRC were obtained from Cell Signaling. Phospho-FAK (Y397)
and total CAS antibodies were from BD Transduction Laboratories, anti-GAPDH from Santa Cruz, anti-vinculin and
phospho-SRC (Y416) from Abcam, total PYK2 from Millipore,
and anti-actin from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc.
High-throughput kinase activity proﬁling
A Luminex immunosandwich assay was conducted on 6
Ewing sarcoma cell lines (EWS502, TC71, TC32, A673, SKNEP,
and EW8) and 293FT cells, as previously described (8). Brieﬂy,
whole-cell lysates from each cell line were quantiﬁed, and equal
concentrations of protein were incubated overnight at 4 C
with a mixture of 87 validated antibody-coupled Luminex
beads (probes) speciﬁc for 62 tyrosine kinases. The mixture
was then washed and incubated with biotin-labeled 4G10
antibody (Millipore) for 30 minutes at room temperature,
washed, and then incubated with 4 mg/mL of SAPE (Molecular
Probes) for 10 minutes at room temperature. The conjugates
were washed 2 additional times and analyzed on a FlexMAP 3D
(Luminex) with xPONENT software (version 4.0; Luminex) to
determine the median ﬂuorescent intensity (MFI).

Immunohistochemistry
Fifteen Ewing sarcoma tumor cores were obtained
through Institutional Review Board–approved discarded
tissue protocols from Massachusetts General Hospital and
Children's Hospital Boston. A673 cell lines with and without
FAK-directed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) were used for
controls. Tumors and controls were examined for phospho-FAK (Y397) protein expression using standard immunohistochemical techniques. A hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained slide was also prepared for each tumor to
deﬁne the tumor margins. Phospho-FAK expression was
scored on a semiquantitative scale based on the percentage
of positive staining tumor cells (11).
Lentivirus production and lentiviral transduction
Lentivirus was produced by transfecting HEK-293T cells
with the appropriate pLKO.1 lentiviral vector and packaging
plasmids (pCMV8.9 and pCMV-VSVG) according to the
FuGENE 6 (Roche) protocol. Plasmids were obtained from
The RNAi Consortium (Broad Institute). For lentiviral transduction, Ewing sarcoma cells were incubated with 2 mL of virus
and 8 mg/mL of polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 hours. Cells
were selected in puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) 48 hours posttransduction. shRNA target sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Small-molecule treatment in vitro
Ewing sarcoma cells were plated in 10-cm dishes, allowed to
adhere for 24 hours, and then treated with PF-562271 (FAK/
PYK2 inhibitor, Haoyuan Chemexpress Co., Ltd.), PD0325901
(MEK inhibitor, Selleck Chemicals), or dasatinib (SRC, BCR/
ABL, c-Kit inhibitor, and others, ChemieTek).
Cell viability
ATP content was measured as a surrogate for cell number
using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
(Promega). Luminescence readings were obtained using the
FLUOstar Omega microplate reader (BMG Labtech). For
experiments with small-molecule treatment, 1.25  103
Ewing sarcoma cells were seeded in each well and treated
with a range of concentrations. IC50 values were calculated
from ATP measurements obtained after 3 days of treatment
using log-transformed, normalized data in GraphPad Prism
5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Cell lines were also treated
with compound in 6-cm dishes, trypsinized, and counted by
light microscopy using trypan blue exclusion. For experiments using shRNA-transduced cells, 1.25  103 cells were
seeded per well into 384-well plates on day 3 posttransduction. ATP content was measured on days 3, 6, and 8
posttransduction.
Colony formation in methylcellulose matrix
Approximately 3.75  103 cells were dissolved into 1.5 mL
of methylcellulose matrix (ClonaCell-TCS Medium, Stemcell
Technologies), plated into gridded 6-cm plates (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc), and incubated for at least 10 days. Colonies from 100 squares were counted using a Nikon inverted
microscope.

Focal Adhesion Kinase Is a Target in Ewing Sarcoma

Flow cytometry
Cells undergoing apoptosis were identiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) using the ApoAlert Annexin
V-FITC Apoptosis Kit (Clontech). For intracellular phosphoprotein staining, cells were ﬁxed and permeabilized using the
BD Cytoﬁx/Cytoperm Kit (BD Biosciences) and stained with
phycoerythrin (PE) anti-phospho-S6 (S240, BD Biosciences)
and analyzed by ﬂow cytometry (BD FACSCanto II).
In vivo studies
Approximately 1  106 A673 cells transduced with either a
control or 2 different FAK-directed shRNAs were suspended in
30% Matrigel and subcutaneously injected into the ﬂank of 6week-old female NCr nude mice (n ¼ 8 per condition). Tumor
volume was measured periodically using calipers to monitor
tumor growth (volume ¼ 0.5  length  width2).
Approximately 4.2  106 A673 cells were mixed with 30%
Matrigel and injected subcutaneously into 8-week-old female
NCr nude mice. When the average tumor volume in all animals
reached approximately 100 mm3, twice-daily treatment was
administered by oral gavage with 200 mg/kg PF-562271 (in a
volume of 10 ml/kg) or vehicle control (0.5% hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose and 0.2% Tween 80 in sterile water; n ¼ 6 per
condition). Ten-week-old male NSG mice were used for in vivo
experiments with TC32 cells to improve tumor engraftment
with this cell line. In this model, several mice experienced
toxicity when treated with PF-562271 at 200 mg/kg twice daily
(data not shown). Therefore, after injection of approximately
5  106 TC32 cells in 30% Matrigel, animals began treatment
with PF-562271 at 100 mg/kg or vehicle control (n ¼ 8 per
condition) every 12 hours when tumor volumes reached 100
mm3. This dose was well tolerated, and at day 13, the dose was
escalated to 150 mg/kg. Tumor volumes were measured with
calipers. Animals were sacriﬁced when tumor volumes
exceeded 2,000 mm3.
Statistical methods
The Student t test or 1- or 2-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc
tests were used to compare groups. Statistical analyses were
conducted using GraphPad Prism 5.0 or SigmaStat 3.5 (Aspire
Software International).

Results
FAK is active in Ewing sarcoma
We proﬁled the activity of 62 unique tyrosine kinases in 6
Ewing sarcoma cell lines using a Luminex bead-based assay
(Fig. 1A; ref. 8). The majority of kinases proﬁled displayed
low phosphorylation levels in Ewing sarcoma cell lines,
which was similar to the phosphorylation levels observed
in the 293FT cell line control. However, SRC kinase (SRC),
extracellular signal–regulated kinases (ERK), and FAK were
highly phosphorylated in the panel of Ewing sarcoma cell
lines (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S2) relative to the
control. Treatment of Ewing sarcoma cell lines with the
SRC inhibitor dasatinib and the MEK inhibitor PD0325901
had minimal effect on cell viability at concentrations that
inhibited phosphorylation of SRC and ERK, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Therefore, we focused our efforts

www.aacrjournals.org

on evaluating the importance of FAK activity in Ewing
sarcoma.
First, we show that FAK is highly phosphorylated across a
panel of 10 Ewing sarcoma cell lines, including those screened
in the proﬁling assay, by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 1C).
Because FAK is known to play a role in adhesion, it was
important to conﬁrm that FAK activity was not merely a
phenomenon of cell lines growing in culture (12). Therefore,
we conducted immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for phosphorylated FAK (Y397) in 15 primary Ewing sarcoma tumor
samples using Ewing sarcoma cell lines with or without FAKdirected shRNA as controls (Fig. 1D and Table 1). All but one
tumor specimen stained positive for the presence of phosphorylated FAK, showing that FAK is expressed and activated
in the majority of Ewing sarcoma tumors.
FAK suppression impairs Ewing sarcoma cell growth and
colony formation
To test the dependency of Ewing sarcoma on the presence of
activated FAK for cell growth and colony formation, we
infected cell lines with lentivirus containing shRNA constructs
targeting multiple different regions of the FAK transcript. We
identiﬁed 5 unique shRNA sequences that robustly downregulated FAK protein levels (Supplementary Fig. S2 and
Supplementary Table S1) and chose 2 shRNAs that gave
consistent knockdown across our panel of cell lines (Fig.
2A) for further study. The downregulation of FAK through
shRNA transduction resulted in signiﬁcantly impaired cell
growth (using ATP content as a surrogate for cell number)
across a panel of 4 cell lines (Fig. 2B), including one line with an
EWS/ERG rearrangement (TTC466). FAK downregulation also
inhibited Ewing sarcoma cell line colony formation in a
methylcellulose matrix, showing that FAK activity contributes
to anchorage-independent growth in Ewing sarcoma cell lines
(Fig. 2C).
A common therapeutic modality for inhibiting kinases is to
use small-molecule inhibitors. These compounds, however, do
not downregulate total protein as is the case for shRNAs, but
rather they inhibit kinase activity. Therefore, it was important
to determine whether the inactivation of FAK activity was
sufﬁcient to induce the effects observed after shRNA-induced
downregulation of FAK. We thus tested the effects of PF562271, a selective inhibitor of both FAK and proline-rich
tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2), a FAK-related family member, on
cell growth and colony formation in Ewing sarcoma cell lines
(13). Seven cell lines were treated for 5 days with PF-562271
across a range of concentrations using 2-fold serial dilutions.
Treatment with PF-562271 impaired cell viability in all cell
lines, with an average IC50 of 2.4 mmol/L after 3 days of
treatment (Fig. 3A). TC32 and A673 were the 2 most sensitive
cell lines, with IC50 concentrations of 2.1 and 1.7 mmol/L,
respectively. After conﬁrming that this luminescent ATP detection assay is a faithful surrogate for cell number in Ewing
sarcoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3), we evaluated the
effects of PF-562271 in a time course. FAK inhibition impaired
Ewing sarcoma cell growth in all cell lines tested (Supplementary Fig. S4). We then tested four Ewing sarcoma cell lines for
their ability to form colonies in a methylcellulose matrix after

S4), indicating that FAK inhibition may also induce apoptosis
in Ewing sarcoma. To test this hypothesis, we treated 4 Ewing
sarcoma cell lines with PF-562271 and measured apoptosis
using Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Apoptosis was
signiﬁcantly increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner across all lines tested (Fig. 3C). To conﬁrm this
ﬁnding, we measured PARP cleavage by Western immunoblotting in Ewing sarcoma cells treated with PF-562271 for 24
hours. There was a concentration-dependent increase in PARP
cleavage, which correlated with our ﬂow cytometric ﬁndings
(Fig. 3D).

FAK inhibition downregulates mTOR and CAS
The mTOR pathway is reported to be activated in a subset of
Ewing sarcoma tumors and is a likely oncogenic driver (14–16).
FAK is a known upstream regulator of AKT in normal tissue
and models of cancer, suggesting a possible mechanistic link in
Ewing sarcoma (17, 18). Therefore, we examined the effects of
FAK inhibition on the AKT/mTOR pathway. First, Ewing
sarcoma cells were serum-starved overnight to prevent oversaturation of this pathway by serum growth factor stimulation.
Then, cells were treated with multiple concentrations of PF562271 for 6 hours, followed by stimulation with IGF-1 for 2
hours. Treatment with PF-562271 downregulated AKT (S473),
mTOR (S2448), and S6 (S240/244) phosphorylation at concentrations that impair cell growth and colony formation (Fig. 4A
and Supplementary Table S3). We next conﬁrmed that S6
phosphorylation was downregulated in cell lines treated with
PF-562271 in a dose response by intracellular phospho-speciﬁc
ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 4B).
FAK is also reported to regulate the activity of Crkl-associated substrate (CAS) and the MEK/ERK pathway in some
cellular contexts (12, 19, 20). Therefore, we examined the
effects of FAK inhibition on CAS and ERK activity in A673
and TC32 cell lines after treatment with PF-562271. We found
that FAK inhibition resulted in downregulation of CAS phosphorylation but not ERK (Fig. 4C). We then identiﬁed 3 unique
CAS-directed shRNAs targeting different regions of the CAS
transcript that robustly downregulate CAS expression (Fig. 4D
and Supplementary Table S1). CAS downregulation in A673
cells had only a modest effect on cell growth and a variable
effect on colony formation (Fig. 4E), suggesting that CAS
inhibition alone cannot account for the effects observed with
FAK inhibition in Ewing sarcoma.

FAK contributes to tumor establishment and growth in
xenograft models of Ewing sarcoma
To conﬁrm that loss of FAK impairs tumor initiation in vivo,
FAK levels were downregulated via shRNA in A673 cells and
injected subcutaneously in NCr nude mice. Because FAK
suppression is selected against over time, we limited the study
to 3 weeks. FAK downregulation signiﬁcantly impaired tumor
establishment and growth in this xenograft model of Ewing
sarcoma (Fig. 5A).
We also tested whether the inhibition of FAK activity by
treatment with PF-562271 could inhibit progression in
established tumors using 2 xenograft models of Ewing
sarcoma. NCr nude and NSG mice were subcutaneously
injected with A673 and TC32 cells, respectively, and allowed
to develop measurable tumors. The animals were then
treated with either vehicle or PF-562271 until the animals
were sacriﬁced. Treatment with PF-562271 signiﬁcantly
inhibited tumor growth compared with the controls showing
that FAK activity contributes to tumor growth in Ewing
sarcoma (Fig. 5B and C).

Discussion
Ewing sarcoma is a rare pediatric cancer with an incidence
of approximately one case per million people in the United
States (21). Although progress has been made in treating this
disease with conventional chemotherapy combined with surgery or radiation for local control, outcomes for relapsed and
metastatic disease are notably poor (9, 10, 22). Furthermore, an
emerging literature on the long-term side effects of these
conventional treatment modalities in pediatric cancer survivors leaves us unsatisﬁed with the current standard of care
(23). However, for many rare pediatric cancers, the tumor
driver events are too often the expression of an aberrant
transcription factor, such as the EWS/FLI rearrangement in
Ewing sarcoma (24), or loss of a tumor suppressor gene, both
challenging to target using conventional drug screening
approaches. Therefore, it is critical to prioritize efforts to
identify more tractable targets in these rare, but devastating,
childhood diseases.
Here, we took an alternative approach to identify new,
potentially more tractable therapeutic targets in Ewing sarcoma. In light of the recent successes targeting kinases in the
treatment of patients with cancer, we focused on this druggable target space. We proﬁled a panel of tyrosine kinases,
inclusive of the majority of kinases with available inhibitors, in
a collection of Ewing sarcoma cell lines. Because virtually all
tyrosine kinases are phosphorylated when activated, tyrosine
kinase phosphorylation was used as a proxy for kinase activity
in this assay. One strength of this approach is that kinase
activation will be identiﬁed independent of the mechanism of
activation. While many cancer-promoting kinase activation
events involve copy number gain or DNA mutation/rearrangement, there are recent examples of kinase activation via
nongenetic events. For example, SYK was reported to be
overexpressed in retinoblastoma via epigenetic regulation
(2) and the tyrosine kinase Met (MET) is activated in many
cancers by overexpression of the ligand, hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF; ref. 25).

SRC kinase, ERK, and FAK were highly phosphorylated in
this screen. While SRC kinase and ERK pose attractive targets,
chemical inhibition at concentrations eliminating phosphorylation had minimal effect on cell viability in the Ewing
sarcoma cell lines evaluated. Therefore, our study focused on
the validation of FAK as a potential therapeutic target in Ewing
sarcoma. FAK is a non–receptor tyrosine kinase and central
regulator of integrin signaling that mediates many normal
cellular functions including adhesion, migration, survival,
growth, and differentiation. FAK activation is initiated through
a variety of extracellular signals that allow the cell to adapt to
changes in the surrounding environment (26, 27). Activation of
FAK leads to autophosphorylation at Y397, triggering an
association with the SH2 domain of many signaling proteins
including SRC, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phospholipase C, gamma 1 (PLCG1), and growth factor receptor–bound

protein 7 (GRB7; refs. 28–31). Aberrant upregulation of FAK
activity is a frequent event in cancer, promoting cell growth,
survival, and invasion (32–34), and FAK activation is also
associated with poor outcomes and increased metastatic
potential (35). Downregulation of FAK activity in numerous
cancer models impairs survival in vitro and inhibits tumor
growth in xenograft models (13, 33).
Previous studies in Ewing sarcoma have alluded to a potential role for adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of this
disease. A gene expression–based study identiﬁed panels of
highly expressed genes associated with poor prognosis in
Ewing sarcoma. Among the gene sets identiﬁed was a collection of genes regulating cell adhesion, supporting a role for
adhesion molecules in Ewing sarcoma (36). In a second study,
FAK transcript levels were found to be elevated in a panel of
Ewing sarcoma family cell lines compared with normal

has variable association with increased expression of FAK
protein (40, 41). Interestingly, in Ewing sarcoma, chromosome 8 copy number gain is a frequent genetic event,
potentially implicating FAK in the pathogenesis of this
disease (42). However, despite reports of FAK expression in
Ewing sarcoma cell lines, to our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
study to show that FAK is highly phosphorylated in both
Ewing sarcoma cell lines and Ewing sarcoma primary tumor
samples, and it is the ﬁrst to describe the dependency of
Ewing sarcoma on FAK activity. Our in vitro and in vivo

2880

Cancer Res; 73(9) May 1, 2013

studies using both FAK-directed shRNA and chemical inhibition of FAK, show that Ewing sarcoma is dependent on
FAK activity for growth, colony formation, tumor establishment, and tumor progression.
Efforts to develop targeted therapy for Ewing sarcoma are
still in their infancy. However, studies have shown that downregulation of the AKT/mTOR pathway has antitumor activity,
and inhibiting this pathway may be a reasonable approach to
targeting this disease (14, 15). In fact, there has been modest
success in treating relapsed and refractory Ewing sarcoma

Figure 5. FAK inhibition impairs tumor engraftment and tumor progression

tumors with IGF1R-targeted antibody therapy (7). Studies have
shown that the inhibition of IGF1R leads to downregulation of
AKT and mTOR in Ewing sarcoma (43). Furthermore, there is
an emerging literature that champions the targeting of multiple nodes in a critical cancer pathway by using a combination
of inhibitors to improve response and prevent the development
of resistance (44). An RNAi screen in Ewing sarcoma determined that downregulation of the mTOR pathway sensitized
Ewing sarcoma cells to IGF1R inhibition, and a recent phase I
study showed tumor responses in a subset of patients with
refractory Ewing sarcoma using IGF1R- and mTOR-targeted
combination therapy (45, 46). While FAK activation may have
multiple cancer-promoting effects in Ewing sarcoma, treatment of Ewing sarcoma cells with PF-562271 downregulated
the activity of the AKT/mTOR pathway, suggesting that the
inhibition of FAK is not only an attractive approach to treating

www.aacrjournals.org

Ewing sarcoma but also may offer a logical candidate for
combination therapy with IGF1R- or AKT/mTOR-targeted
treatment. Because PF-562271 is also reported to inhibit PYK2
(13), which is variably expressed in Ewing sarcoma cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S5), another possibility is that, in a subset
of Ewing sarcoma cell lines, PYK2 inhibition contributes to the
downregulation of the AKT/mTOR pathway.
In exploring other reported downstream effectors of FAK,
we also found that treatment with PF-562271 in Ewing sarcoma
cells inhibited CAS. Genetic downregulation of CAS, however,
had only a modest effect on cell growth and colony formation
in Ewing sarcoma cells, suggesting that CAS inhibition alone is
not sufﬁcient to explain the effects of FAK inhibition in vitro.
CAS has been shown to play a role in cancer cell invasion and
migration (47). One study reported that in a glioblastoma cell
line ectopically expressing PTEN, overexpression of CAS
restored invasion and migration but did not fully rescue cell
growth (48). Because of the reported role of FAK/CAS in cancer
metastasis, it will be important to determine in future studies
whether this axis is relevant to the metastasis of Ewing
sarcoma tumors. Moreover, additional pathways downstream
of FAK, not explored in the current study, may be contributing
to the anti–Ewing sarcoma phenotype seen with FAK
inhibition.
Finally, it is important to note that there are several
recently completed or ongoing early-phase clinical trials
using FAK inhibitors to treat adult patients with solid
tumors (http://clinicaltrials.gov/; NCT00666926, NCT00996671,
NCT00787033, NCT01138033). Early reports for one of these
inhibitors suggest that these drugs are well tolerated.
Interestingly, several patients had disease response by positron
emission tomography (PET) and prolonged stabilization of
disease while on treatment (49). While it is still too early to
draw conclusions from these clinical trials, the availability of
clinically relevant FAK inhibitors, combined with the results
described in our study, suggest the potential for rapid
translation to the clinic for patients with Ewing sarcoma.
