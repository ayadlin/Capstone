BACKGROUND. Currently, histology is used as the endpoint to define success with
photodynamic therapy (PDT) in patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD).
Recurrences despite ‘successful’ ablation are common. The role of biomarkers in
assessing response to PDT remains undefined. The objectives of the current study
were 1) to assess biomarkers in a prospective cohort of patients with HGD/mucosal cancer before and after PDT and 2) to correlate biomarker status after PDT
with histology.

METHODS. Patients who underwent PDT for HGD/mucosal cancer were studied
prospectively. All patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 4-quadrant
biopsies every centimeter, endoscopic mucosal resection of visible nodules, and
endoscopic ultrasound. Cytology samples were obtained by using standard cytology brushes. Biomarkers were assessed by using fluorescence in situ hybridiza-

(interquartile range [IQR], 56–73 years), and 28 patients (88%) were men. The
mean Barrett segment length was 5 cm (standard error of the mean, 0.5 cm).
Post-PDT biomarkers were obtained after a median duration of 9 months (IQR,
3–12 months). There was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of
several biomarkers assessed after PDT. Six patients without HGD after PDT still
had positive FISH results for 1 or more biomarkers: of these, 2 patients (33%)

CONCLUSIONS. In this initial study, histologic downgrading of dysplasia after PDT
was associated with the loss of biomarkers that have been associated with progression of neoplasia in Barrett esophagus. Patients with persistently positive biomarkers appeared to be at a higher risk of recurrent HGD. These findings should
be confirmed in a larger study. Cancer 2008;113:470–6.  2008 American Cancer

(LGD), to high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and finally
carcinoma. HGD on histologic samples has been
used as the most reliable clinical biomarker of potential carcinogenesis, with studies reporting variable
rates of progression to esophageal carcinoma (range,
16%–59%).3–5 Interruption of the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence by ablating or resecting this
at-risk mucosa has been proposed as a strategy to
reduce the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma
and has served as the rationale for the recommendation of esophagectomy for patients with HGD.
Over the past few years, endoscopic therapy has
emerged as an alternative to esophagectomy because
of the significant mortality and morbidity associated
with esophagectomy.6,7 Multiple modalities, including photodynamic therapy (PDT),8 argon plasma
coagulation,9 and multipolar electrocoagulation10 in
isolation and in combination with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR),11,12 have been reported in the
treatment of HGD. Variable success rates have been
reported (range, 75%–90%). A randomized multicenter trial compared PDT with surveillance and treatment with omeprazole in patients with HGD. After a
24-month follow-up, complete ablation of HGD was
noted in 77% of patients versus 39% in the omeprazole group. Thirteen percent of patients who received
PDT plus omeprazole progressed to cancer compared
with 28% of patients in the omeprazole group.13 This
led to U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval
for the use of PDT for the treatment of HGD in BE.
We recently reported that long-term outcomes
(overall mortality and cancer-free survival) were
comparable between patients who underwent esophagectomy and patients who received PDT.14
Several genetic alterations have been described
in BE. These include loss of cell cycle checkpoint
genes, such as p16 and p53. Loss of these genes by
allelic loss (deletions or loss of heterozygosity
[LOH]), point mutations, or promoter hypermethylation (for p16) have been observed in a substantial
number of patients with BE.15,16 Several other genetic
alterations that involve gains/amplifications of protooncogenes (and growth factors/growth factor receptors) as well as changes in DNA content (as assessed
by flow cytometry and image cytometry) also have
been described.17,18
Currently, histology is used as the endpoint to
define success with ablative therapy in HGD. However, recurrences and/or progression to cancer despite ‘successful’ ablation/resection are common. To
our knowledge, predictors of recurrent dysplasia
have not been defined. Few studies have assessed
genetic alterations after ablation of BE19–21: those
studies primarily assessed patients with predomi-

471

nantly nondysplastic BE (a category for which ablation currently is not recommended) rather than HGD
(in which endoscopic ablation is gaining acceptance
as an alternative to esophagectomy) by using techniques that lack long-term data on successful ablation.
Studies also have raised concern about the appearance of cancer-associated biomarkers after ablation
(in patients with nondysplastic BE)20: however, data
are lacking on the clinical implication of this phenomenon in terms of the recurrence or progression
of dysplasia.
The role of biomarkers in defining response to
PDT remains unclear. The correlation between histologic response and ‘biomarker response’ also is
unknown. We hypothesized that patients who remain
positive for genetic alterations despite achieving a
histologic response to PDT would be at risk for recurrence of dysplasia. In this study, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to characterize
genetic alterations that were present in patients with
HGD and mucosal cancer before treatment with PDT
and compared them with the alterations observed after PDT. In addition, we assessed the recurrence of
dysplasia after initial histologic response and correlated those findings with post-PDT genetic alterations assessed by FISH.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with HGD and/or mucosal cancer (defined
as carcinoma confined to the mucosa without invasion of the submucosa) who were seen in the Barrett
Esophagus Unit at St. Mary’s Hospital, Rochester,
Minnesota between 2002 and 2006 were included in
this study. Inclusion criteria were the presence of
HGD/intramucosal carcinoma on biopsies, assessment of biomarkers using FISH before and after PDT,
and treatment with PDT. Exclusion criteria included
patients with submucosal cancer on EMR (who were
referred to surgery) and patients who were unwilling
or unable to consent to the study. Clinical, demographic, and endoscopic data were extracted from a
prospectively maintained database and included
length of Barrett segment, performance of EMR
before PDT (including number of EMRs), number of
PDT treatments per application, results of post-PDT
biopsies (classified as carcinoma, HGD, LGD, or nondysplastic BE), and biomarkers obtained using FISH
before and after PDT.
All patients underwent 4-quadrant biopsies every
centimeter of the involved esophagus. All patients
had their diagnosis of HGD or mucosal cancer confirmed by 2 experienced gastrointestinal pathologists.
Baseline assessments also included endoscopic ultra-

Cytology Specimen Acquisition
Cytology specimens for FISH were obtained during
the endoscopy immediately before PDT. During endoscopy, a cytology brush (Hobbs Medical Inc., Stafford Springs, Conn) was swept over the entire Barrett
segment after the mucosal surface was sprayed with
10 mL of N-acetyl cysteine (as a mucolytic). Then,
the brush was placed in a vial that contained 20 mL
of PreservCyt solution (Cytyc Corp., Marlborough,
Mass). Endoscopic brushing specimens were processed by washing the brush with 40 mL of 3:1
methanol:glacial acetic acid fixative solution. Cells
were sedimented at 3800g for 8 minutes. The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 10 mL of 3:1 methanol:glacial acetic acid
fixative solution. Next, the cells were sedimented
again at 3300g for 8 minutes. All but 100 lL of the
supernatant was removed. Finally, the cell pellet was
resuspended, and the slides were prepared.

Slide Preparation
Approximately 3 lL of the cell pellet suspension were
pipetted onto 3 etched 1-cm rings (Gold Seal, Portsmouth, NH), 1 ring for each of the 3 probe sets. Cellularity was assessed with a phase contrast
microscope. Additional cell suspension was added to
the slide until adequate cellularity was reached (ie,
the highest number of cells possible per ring with
minimal cell overlap) or until the cell pellet was exhausted. Table 1 describes the biomarkers that were
assessed prospectively in this study.
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization
Esophageal brushing cells were harvested, fixed, and
placed on a slide as described previously.22 Then, the
following fluorescently labeled DNA probes were
hybridized to the specimens: 8q24.12-q24.13 (CMYC), 9p21 (P16), 17p13.1 (p53), 17q11.2-q12 (HER2), and 20q13.2 (Abbott Molecular Inc., Des Plaines,
Ill). Next, the slides were washed and stained with
the nuclear counterstain 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Abbott Molecular Inc.). Fluorescence microscopy was used with unique band filters that were
specific for each of the probe fluorophores to analyze
and record all observed signal patterns for 100 (minimum, 50) consecutive, noninflammatory, nonsquamous cells. Enumeration was performed without
knowledge of the patient’s clinical or histologic diagnosis. Details regarding the probes and thresholds
for positivity are provided in Table 1.

* The cutoffs used for 8q (C-MYC), 9p21 (P16), 17q (HER2), and 20q were established by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Based on these ROC curves, a specimen was considered
positive for P16 loss when 11% of cells exhibited hemizygous 9p21 loss, when 6% of cells exhibited homozygous 9p21 loss, or when 11% of cells exhibited a mixture of hemizygous and homozygous 9p21 loss. Thresholds for categorizing results as positive for the other probes were as follows:
14% of cells exhibited p53 loss (cutoff for P53 loss was the average percentage of P53 loss 3
standard deviation observed in a normal value study) (unpublished observations), or 5% of cells
demonstrated gains of 8q24, 17q11.2, or 20q13. ‘Multiple gains’ were defined as gains of 2 or more
of the 8q24, 17q11.2, or 20q13 loci by using previously defined thresholds.
y
Defined as gains of 2 or more of the 4 probes in a patient.

Photodynamic Therapy
Porfimer sodium (Photofrin; Axcan Pharma, MontSt.-Hilaire, Quebec, Canada) was used as a photosensitizer at a dose of 2 mg/kg. Photofrin was administered intravenously 48 hours before photoradiation,
which was performed by using a bare cylindrical diffusing fiber. The cylindrical diffusing fibers were either 2.5 cm or 5.0 cm in length (Fibers Direct,
Andover, Mass). The cylindrical diffusing fiber was
passed through the accessory channel of the endoscope and placed in the center of the esophageal
lumen. The light was delivered from a laser (Lambda
Plus [Coherent, Palo Alto, Calif] or Diomed [Diomed
Inc., Andover, Mass]) that produced 630 nm light
with an adjusted power output of 400 mW/cm fiber
and delivered a total of 200 J/cm fiber energy to the
mucosa.
Endoscopic Mucosal Resection
Focal, endoscopically visible lesions underwent EMR
for diagnostic purposes to determine histology and
to exclude carcinoma. EMR was performed as
described previously.23 PDT was delayed for a minimum of 4 weeks if a patient underwent EMR to allow
healing of the EMR site(s).
All patients were placed on twice a day proton
pump inhibitor therapy after PDT at the standard
dose for the pump. Patients were educated carefully
regarding PDT and its complications, especially dysphagia and photosensitivity, by physicians, nurse
practitioners, and clinical coordinators. Follow-up
included endoscopic surveillance with biopsies and

EMR, if indicated, every 3 months for 2 years, then
every 6 months for 1 or 2 years if HGD was eliminated. If HGD persisted, then patients were followed
at 3-month intervals. If LGD was present, then
patients were followed every 6 months. If only nondysplastic Barrett mucosa or normal squamous mucosa was present at 2 years, then patients were
followed annually. Post-PDT cytology specimens
were acquired at the first endoscopy after PDT (3
months after PDT), and the results were correlated
with histology obtained from biopsies that were
taken at that visit. Repeat cytology samples were collected during subsequent endoscopy in patients who
consented to repeat acquisition of cytology specimens and repeat FISH assays.

Statistical Methods
The associations of baseline characteristics with
response outcome were assessed for continuous variables by using the 2-sample t test or the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test, depending on the distribution of the
baseline variable. The associations for baseline categorical data were assessed by using the chi-square
test (or the Fisher exact test when necessary because
of small individual cell frequencies). Similarly, the
association of response (no vs yes at the time of
repeat biomarker assessment) and biomarker status
was assessed by using the Fisher exact test. Continuous variables were summarized as the mean
(standard deviation [SD]) or median (interquartile
range [IQR]), as warranted. A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant. The difference
between the proportions of positive biomarkers (prePDT vs post-PDT) was examined only in patients
who received PDT by using the McNemar test (exact
binomial distribution) at an a level of .05. Data management and statistical analysis were done using SAS
software (1989–2002; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Thirty-one of 71 patients who underwent PDT with
biomarker assessment between 2002 and 2005 at the
Mayo Clinic, Rochester had biomarkers assessed after
PDT. These patients were younger (aged 64.5 years vs
69.7 years; P 5 .03) than the patients who did not
have repeat biomarkers assessed, but they had a comparable sex distribution (88% men vs 95% men,
respectively; P 5 .39), BE segment length (5 cm vs 5.9
cm, respectively; P 5 .25), and 3-month follow-up histology (chi-square statistic, 1.7; P 5 .74). The median
age of the cohort that had repeat biomarker assessment was 66 years (IQR, 56–73 years). Twenty-eight
patients were men (88%). Twenty-five patients (78%)
had HGD, and the remaining patients had mucosal
cancer. Post-PDT biomarkers were obtained after a
median duration of 6 months (IQR, 3–12 months).
Twenty-four patients (77%) had no evidence of HGD
on biopsies at the time of repeat sampling for biomarkers. The distribution of biomarkers pre-PDT and
post-PDT for the entire cohort is illustrated in Figure 1.
There was a statistically significant decrease in the
proportion of several biomarkers post-PDT. Data on
p53 loss were available only on 17 patients because of
nonavailability of the probes. Three patients had evidence of p53 loss before PDT, and none had p53 loss
after PDT. The median follow-up of patients after PDT
was 22 months (IQR, 11.5–25 months).
The frequency of FISH-positive results in ‘responders’ (with no evidence of dysplasia on surveillance
biopsies; n 5 21) at the time of repeat biomarker
assessment compared with ‘nonresponders’ (n 5 10)
is shown in Table 2. Despite the elimination of dysplasia, a substantial minority of patients (5%–19%)

remained positive by FISH, particularly for gains at
oncogene loci (8q24, 17q31.1). Multiple gains were
observed in no responders compared with 30% of nonresponders. This difference was statistically significant.
The association between response status and overall
FISH positivity was significant (P 5 .04) (Table 2).
Follow-up histology of this cohort is described in
Figure 2. In the subgroup of patients who had an absence of HGD after PDT (N 5 24), 6 patients
remained FISH positive for 1 or more biomarkers. Of
those 6 patients, 2 patients (33%) developed recurrent HGD. One patient developed HGD 9 months after PDT. He had evidence of amplification at the CMYC locus on post-PDT FISH assessment. The second patient with recurrent HGD (which was detected
10 months after PDT) had evidence of multiple gains
on repeat FISH assessment. Both patients developed
recurrent HGD after 2 intervening surveillance
endoscopies without HGD, and both were treated endoscopically with EMR and remained free of HGD at
the time of the current report. In contrast, none of
the 18 patients with negative FISH studies after PDT
developed recurrent HGD over a median follow-up
of 22 months (IQR, 11.5–25 months).

DISCUSSION
Barrett esophagus is a major risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma. Esophagectomy24 and PDT25

are accepted modalities of treatment for HGD in BE
and produce comparable long-term results.14 In this
prospective study, we observed a statistically significant decrease in the prevalence of all biomarkers after PDT. A minority of patients with a histologic
‘response’ after PDT continued to show evidence of
amplification at proto-oncogene loci: That group of
‘responders’ appeared to be at a higher risk of recurrent HGD on follow-up. The absence of genetic
alterations detected by FISH, in addition to histologic
response, predicted a ‘durable’ response to PDT.
The specific chromosomal loci examined in this
study were chosen based on a previous study in
which a panel of FISH probes to these loci was able to
distinguish adenocarcinoma and HGD from lesser
grades of dysplasia with a sensitivity and specificity of
approximately 80%.22 In addition, we selected these
probes for their reliable performance characteristics
and because of the observation that gain/amplification at proto-oncogene loci may be a more specific
indicator of neoplasia than chromosomal losses.22,26
Biomarker studies on squamous islands that
appear in BE during prolonged treatment with proton
pump inhibitors have reported the presence of
increased proliferation and p53 staining.19 Some
authors speculated that this may predict increased
risk of progression to cancer. They assessed the presence of these biomarkers and cyclooxygenase 2

Biomarkers & Histology after PDT in BE/Prasad et al.

(COX-2) by using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in residual BE after ablation20 and observed evidence of
increased Ki-67 staining, COX-2 staining, and p53
staining at the neosquamocolumnar junction, raising
concerns of neoplastic progression after incomplete
ablation therapy. That report was limited by the lack
of histologic follow-up in patients with positive biomarkers, and the poor accuracy of IHC for the p53
protein compared with gene sequencing. Hage et al.
reported the biomarker status of 29 patients
(including 8 patients with HGD) after ablative treatment.21 Markers that were assessed included Ki-67
antigen testing, p53 protein expression by IHC, and
chromosome 1 ploidy by in situ hybridization. Those
authors observed that, despite the elimination of
HGD in 70% of patients, the residual Barrett epithelium continued to show evidence of increased proliferation,. Although the authors speculated that this
increased the risk of progression of dysplasia, they
did not provide information on recurrence of HGD in
these patients on follow-up. Moreover, the significance of increased proliferation in residual epithelium after ablation has yet to be determined.27 In a
follow-up study, the authors assessed genetic alterations by using gene sequencing in preablation and
postablation biopsy specimens.28 In their cohort, only
3 patients with HGD were included. They observed
that the profile of biomarkers was not different before
and after ablative therapy despite the absence of
HGD on follow-up biopsies. This is in contrast to our
finding of a significant change (loss of biomarkers) in
post-PDT surveillance cytology specimens. This may
be attributable to the larger number of patients with
HGD included in our study (3 patients vs 31 patients)
or perhaps because of the difference in techniques.
Although, to our knowledge, this is the largest
study of its kind to date, the current study has some
potential limitations. The possibility cannot be
excluded that the lack of HGD on biopsies may
reflect sampling error. This sampling error also
potentially may affect the correlation of post-PDT
biopsies and FISH markers. The fairly long period of
follow-up (median, 22 months) without HGD does
make this less likely. The proportion of patients with
P1615 and P53 loss29,30 in our cohort is lower than
that reported in the literature. Compared with gene
analysis, dual-probe FISH has moderate sensitivity
(68.4%) but high specificity (95.8%).31 However, FISH
may be more sensitive in identifying allelic loss,
because LOH analyses typically require the presence
of 70% tumor cells in a sample to be able to detect
LOH.31 We also performed FISH on cytology specimens, because the use of tissue sections may lead to
sectioning artifacts, which could compromise FISH

475

results. Finally, only 31 patients (44%) underwent
repeat FISH assessment after PDT, raising the possibility of selection bias. Patients who did not have
repeat biomarker assessments largely had demographic and clinical characteristics that were comparable to those in patients who did have repeat
biomarker assessments. Finally, we recognize that,
although this may have been the largest study to
date in these patients, the sample size of the study
was limited, and our results need to be validated in a
larger multicenter study.
In conclusion, the absence of HGD after PDT
appears to be associated with a significant decrease
in the prevalence of biomarkers associated with the
progression of neoplasia in BE. Patients with a histologic response (the absence of HGD) who have persistent genetic abnormalities appear to be a higher
risk of developing recurrent HGD: This cohort of
patients may merit closer and longer surveillance. In
contrast, patients who have histologic and ‘genetic’
responses may be at decreased risk of recurrence
and may not require further mucosal therapy.
