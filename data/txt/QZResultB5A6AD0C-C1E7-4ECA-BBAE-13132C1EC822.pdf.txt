ABSTRACT
TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) is a well-known apoptosis
inducer, which activates the extrinsic death pathway. TRAIL is pro-apoptotic on colon
cancer cells, while not cytotoxic towards normal healthy cells. However, its clinical use
is limited by cell resistance to cell death which occurs in approximately 50% of cancer
cells. Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) are also known to specifically induce apoptosis
of cancer cells. In accordance, we have shown that food grade dairy propionibacteria
induce intrinsic apoptosis of colon cancer cells, via the production and release of
SCFA (propionate and acetate) acting on mitochondria. Here, we investigated possible
synergistic effect between Propionibacterium freudenreichii and TRAIL. Indeed, we
hypothesized that acting on both extrinsic and intrinsic death pathways may exert
a synergistic pro-apoptotic effect. Whole transcriptomic analysis demonstrated
that propionibacterial supernatant or propionibacterial metabolites (propionate
and acetate), in combination with TRAIL, increased pro-apoptotic gene expression
(TRAIL-R2/DR5) and decreased anti-apoptotic gene expression (FLIP, XIAP) in HT29
human colon cancer cells. The revealed synergistic pro-apoptotic effect, depending on
both death receptors (TRAIL-R1/DR4, TRAIL-R2/DR5) and caspases (caspase-8, -9 and
-3) activation, was lethal on cancer cells but not on normal human intestinal epithelial
cells (HIEC), and was inhibited by Bcl-2 expression. Finally, milk fermented by P.
freudenreichii induced HT29 cells apoptosis and enhanced TRAIL cytotoxic activity, as
did P. freudenreichii DMEM culture supernatants or its SCFA metabolites. These results
open new perspectives for food grade P. freudenreichii-containing products in order
to potentiate TRAIL-based cancer therapy in colorectal cancer.

INTRODUCTION

combination or not with TRAIL. Analysis of microarrays
demonstrated that SN or C3/C2 in combination with
TRAIL modulated the expression of apoptosis related
genes. This effect was confirmed in cytotoxic and
apoptotic cellular assays showing a synergistic proapoptotic action between Pf culture supernatant (or C3/
C2) and TRAIL. Finally, a milk fermented by Pf exhibited
the same pro-apoptotic properties as Pf culture supernatant
and sensitized colon cancer cells to TRAIL.

Colorectal cancer (CRC), the fourth most frequent
cause of cancer deaths worldwide, is tightly linked with
lifestyle, including diet [1]. Efforts are made to prevent
and/or fight CRC using food components, including
prebiotics and probiotics. In this context, dairy Gram
positive propionibacteria, as the probiotic species
Propionibacterium freudenreichii (Pf) [2], were shown
to induce apoptosis of colon cancer cells via the intrinsic
apoptotic death pathway [3, 4]. These propionibacteria
induce apoptosis, via the production of SCFAs, not only
in vitro but also in vivo in human microbiota-associated
rats [5]. Interestingly, Pf enhances apoptosis and lowers
proliferation only in the context of carcinogenesis induced
by dimethylhydrazine (DMH-treated rats) and not in
healthy conditions (control rats) [5]. Recently, a first milk
fermented exclusively by Pf was obtained and was shown
to induce apoptosis in HGT-1 human gastric cancer cells
[6]. In this previous study, we have shown that the active
compounds, SCFAs, are secreted and recovered in the
aqueous phase of the fermented dairy product.
TRAIL, a member of the TNF superfamily,
selectively kills transformed and cancer cells, but not
most normal cells, by triggering the extrinsic apoptotic
death pathway [7]. Indeed, the recombinant human soluble
TRAIL (rhTRAIL) is a candidate for cancer therapy [8–
10]. TRAIL has anti-tumour activity against a wide variety
of tumour cell lines in vitro and in vivo, including colon
cancer [11]. Interestingly, studies have shown that colon
carcinomas and high-grade adenomas are more sensitive
to TRAIL than normal colonic epithelium, confirming the
interest of using TRAIL for colon cancer therapy [12, 13].
TRAIL has also shown efficacy against primary human
colon tumour explants in mice [14]. However, most
cells derived from human colorectal cancer are resistant
against TRAIL-induced apoptosis due to defects in TRAIL
signalling machinery [15]. To restore TRAIL sensitivity,
combination of TRAIL with chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
IFN-γ or other targeted therapies has thus been used [11,
16]. Treatment combining TRAIL with chemotherapy
showed for instance a synergistic cytotoxic effect in
human cancer cell lines, in tumour xenografts [17, 18],
and in patients’ colon tumours grown in SCID mice [14],
even in drug-resistant ones.
A previous study, particularly, examined the
transcriptional response of HT29 cells co-cultivated
with probiotic bacterial strains [19]. In this report, the
presence of some Gram positive bacteria (bifidobacteria,
lactobacilli), other than dairy propionibacteria, modulated
expression of genes involved in cytokine-chemokine
receptor interactions and NOD signalling, but not
apoptosis. In the current work, we compared for the
first time the whole genome expression of HT29 cells
treated with Pf culture supernatant (SN) or a mixture of
its major metabolites (propionate and acetate, C3/C2), in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

RESULTS
Apoptosis signaling pathway is modulated by
P. freudenreichii culture supernatant, metabolites
(propionate/acetate) or TRAIL alone and by
their combinations
A whole transcriptome analysis was carried out
using microarrays, to elucidate the response of HT29
human colon cancer cells to a 6 h treatment combining
TRAIL (100 ng/ml + 2 μg/ml anti-Flag M2 antibody)
with propionibacterial culture supernatant (SN diluted
to 1/2) or a mixture of propionate (30 mM) and acetate
(15 mM) (C3/C2, the major metabolites used in the
amounts present in the diluted SN). As illustrated by Venn
diagrams (Figure 1A and see Supplementary Table 1 for
lists of genes), most of the genes induced by SN were
also induced by C3/C2 (2180 genes) suggesting a similar
effect due to the presence of acetate and propionate in
the propionibacterial culture supernatant. Treatment by
TRAIL led to a much limited number of over-expressed
genes (314 genes), while co-treatments induced expression
of 3313 and 3376 genes (for TRAIL+SN and TRAIL+C3/
C2, respectively).
To further explore the significance of transcriptomic
changes triggered by co-treatments, we investigated the
functional annotation of overexpressed genes in the cotreatments compared to the single treatments. We used
FatiGo, a web tool from the Babelomics suite, to find
significant KEGG pathways associations with groups of
genes [20]. Importantly, genes shared by all conditions
(i.e single treatments or combinations), are characterized
by common KEGG pathways including apoptosis, NODlike receptors and cytokine-cytokine receptors interaction
(Figure 1B), known to play a role in immune response.
Of note, genes from the combination TRAIL with C3/C2
showed an important increase in the number of KEGG
pathways compared with genes from single treatment,
suggesting a functional synergy between C3/C2 and
TRAIL treatments (Supplementary Table 2).
Focusing on apoptosis, we next extracted expression
data for 19 apoptosis-related genes. As shown in Figure
1C, the association of TRAIL with either SN or C3/C2
clearly negatively or positively modulated the expression
of pro- or anti- apoptotic genes. More specifically, the
expression of pro-apoptotic (TNFRSF10B) or anti7162

apoptotic (CFLAR, XIAP) genes, related to the TRAIL
death receptor pathway, were increased or decreased,
respectively, in cells treated by TRAIL combined with
either SN or C3/C2 (Figure 1C and Table 1). These
results thereby demonstrated the efficiency of cotreatments in relationship with apoptosis. Interestingly,
propionibacterial SN or C3/C2 metabolites, alone, induced
TNFRSF10B (alias TRAIL-R2/DR5) expression, a TRAIL
death receptor (Figure 1C and Table 1). TNFRSF10B
overexpression was thus confirmed, at the protein level,
by characterizing TRAIL-R1 or TRAIL-R2 membrane
expression on HT29 cells by flow cytometry after their
treatment with the supernatant of Pf-fermented milk
ultrafiltrate (FMUF ½), prepared as previously described
[6]. An increase in TRAIL-R2 membrane expression was
thus observed in HT29 cells after a 12 h treatment with
FMUF (Figure 2A), and up to 24 h (Figure 2B). Together,
these data suggest that SCFA metabolites (also present in
SN or FMUF) may potentiate TRAIL-induced apoptotic
effect.

However, HIEC human healthy epithelial colon
cells were less susceptible than HT29 or HCT116 cells
to cell death induction by combined treatments (Figure
3C), suggesting that normal cells would be spared from
the toxicity of TRAIL in combination with SN or C3/C2.
Expression or not of p53 did not modify the cytotoxicity
of TRAIL/SN or TRAIL/C3/C2 combinations in HCT116
(Figure 3D and 3E).

Bcl-2 is a resistance factor towards treatment
induced by combination of TRAIL with SN or
C3/C2
We compared the cytotoxicity of the combined
treatments (TRAIL with SN or C3/C2) in HT29 cells
that do not constitutively express Bcl-2 (HT29-neo) and
in HT29 cells stably transfected with Bcl-2 (HT29-Bcl2)
[21]. After a 24 h treatment, HT29-Bcl2 cells presented
a decreased cell sensitivity to combination of TRAIL
with SN or C3/C2, in comparison with HT29-neo cells
(Figure 4A and 4B).
Then, we performed western blot experiments
(Figure 4C). Activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3 was
observed in HT29-neo cells exposed to TRAIL/SN or
TRAIL/C3/C2 combination, as evidenced by the decreased
amount of the proforms of caspase-3, -8 and -9 which are
no more detected at the end of the 24 h treatment and
the appearance of cleavage products of caspase-8 (41/43
kDa) and caspase-9 (35/37 kDa), as well as the complete
cleavage of PARP-1, a substrate of caspase-3. In HT29Bcl2 cells treated with TRAIL/SN or TRAIL/C3/C2, the
proforms of caspases-8, -9 and -3 were still detected by
western blot as well as the uncleaved PARP-1 (Figure
4C) at the end of the 24 h treatment, suggesting that
expression of Bcl-2 delays the activation of caspases-8, -9
and -3, leading to TRAIL/SN or TRAIL/C3/C2 resistance
(Figure 4A and 4B). As it has been shown that SCFA can
modulate histone acetylation [22], we demonstrated that
treatment of HT29 cells with SN or C3/C2 alone or in

P. freudenreichii metabolites enhance TRAIL
cytotoxicity in HT29 or HCT116 human colon
cancer cells compared to HIEC human healthy
intestinal epithelial cells
Since the microarray analysis suggests an enhanced
pro-apoptotic effect of TRAIL in combination with SN or
C3/C2 in HT29 cells, we further analysed the cytotoxic
effect of these treatments using a methylene blue assay
[6]. Up to 100 ng/ml, TRAIL had a low cytotoxic effect on
its own in HT29 cells, with less than 10% of viability loss
after 24 h, as shown in Figure 3A and 3B (0-5% of cell
death for 25 ng/ml). Besides, propionibacterial supernatant
at the highest concentration (½) only killed 23% after 24
h. However, a synergistic effect was observed for 25 ng/ml
of TRAIL in combination with SN ½, leading to 57% of
cell death (Figure 3A). Similar results were observed for
TRAIL in combination with C3/C2 (Figure 3B).

which may be indicative of a histone deacetylase

double staining, was similar to the untreated control (NT)
(Figure 5A), in accordance with the very low cytotoxicity
of these concentrations, as detected in viability assay
(Figure 3B). Treatment with TRAIL alone induced 20% of
apoptotic cells. However, combination of TRAIL with C3/
C2 led to an increase in apoptosis, with 45% of apoptotic
cells (Figure 5A). Blocking TRAIL death receptors by
using antagonistic antibodies against DR4 and DR5 (Abs)
led to an almost complete inhibition of apoptosis induced
by TRAIL and C3/C2 combination, showing activation of
the extrinsic death pathway. Control treatment with these
antibodies alone had no effect (Figure 5A).

TRAIL/C3/C2 synergistic cytotoxicity involves
the activation of both extrinsic and intrinsic
apoptotic pathways

Moreover, Figure 5B showed that z-VAD-fmk, a
pan-caspase inhibitor, drastically reduced the synergistic
apoptotic effect of TRAIL with C3/C2 in HT29 cells,
while a caspase inhibitor negative control, z-FA-fmk
had no effect, confirming the role of caspases in this cell
death pathway. Finally, Figure 5C evidenced an enhanced
activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3, as a result of cotreatment, in comparison with treatment with TRAIL or
C3/C2 alone, which was in agreement with Western blot
data (Figure 4C). Activation of caspase-8 or caspase-9
by co-treatment evidenced activation of extrinsic or
intrinsic death pathway, respectively. Next, we assessed
the impact of propionibacterial metabolites (C3/C2) or SN
on expression of some key regulatory proteins of apoptosis

signalling machinery (Bax, Bak, p21, Mcl-1, Bcl-XL,
FLIPL, XIAP). Western blot analysis showed enhanced
cellular contents of acetylated histone H3 and p21 in a
time-dependent manner following treatment with C3/C2
or SN in HT29 cells (Figure 5D), suggesting inhibition
of histone deacetylase. Moreover, the expression of two
inhibitors of the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway FLIPL and XIAP respectively, was decreased by
C3/C2 or SN treatment (Figure 5D), which could explain
cells sensitivity when C3/C2 or SN are combined with
TRAIL. These data are in accordance with microarray
analysis showing an increase in mRNA level expression of
CDKN1A (p21) or a decrease in mRNA level expression
of CFLAR (FLIPL) and XIAP after a 6 h treatment with SN

expression of Bax, Bak, Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL were observed
after C3/C2 or SN treatment (Figure 5D and Table 1).

metabolites or SN sensitize cells to TRAIL and enhance
its effect, we thus hypothesized that a dairy product,
fermented exclusively by P. freudenreichii, might sensitize

after 72 h) (Figure 8E and 8F). Accumulation of anion
superoxide (O2.-) was followed using ethidium staining
and flow cytometry analysis (Figure 8G and 8H), leading
to 58% of cells with accumulated superoxide anion after
72 h of treatment with FMUF. Finally, immunoblotting
examination of a cytoplasmic-enriched fraction for the
presence of cytochrome c revealed a strong release of this
protein from mitochondria into the cytoplasm upon time
treatment with FMUF (Figure 8I).
Altogether,
these
results
indicate
that
propionibacterial metabolites contained in FMUF
induced cell cycle arrest and typical hallmarks of intrinsic
apoptosis.

P. freudenreichii- fermented milk or fermented
milk ultrafiltrate induces colon cancer cells
apoptosis
A milk (FM) and a milk ultrafiltrate (FMUF, i.e.
milk devoid of casein), both fermented exclusively by P.
freudenreichii, were prepared as previously described by
Cousin et al [6, 23, 24]. Supernatants of both products,
either in the presence or absence of milk caseins, contained
similar concentration of C3 (close to 60 mM) and of C2
(close to 30 mM), and induced cell death in dose- and
time-dependent manner in HT29 cells (Figure 6A). FMUF
gave similar results as FM and was clear while FM was
turbid, so that following experiments were performed
using FMUF.
In accordance with effects reported for
propionibacterial metabolites C3/C2, FMUF induced a
caspase-dependent apoptosis in HT29 cells (Figure 7).
Western blotting analysis revealed cleaved forms for
caspases -3, -8 and -9 after 72 h of treatment with FMUF
½ (Figure 7A). Moreover, activities of caspases-3, -8
and -9 were quantified in HT29 cell extracts (Figure 7B).
Unfermented milk ultrafiltrate (Co) did not induce any
caspase activity. By contrast, FMUF induced activation
of the 3 caspases detected at 48 h and 72 h, as did C3/C2
or etoposide (Eto.), used as an apoptosis positive control
(Figure 7A and 7B).
Modifications of DNA content was also monitored
by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. Up
to 52% of cells were in the sub-G1 fraction after 72 h
of treatment, while shorter treatment time resulted in
enhanced G0/G1 population (70 % at 24 h of treatment)
(Figure 8A and 8B), these data were in accordance with
the observed chromatin fragmentation in apoptotic nuclei
resulting in DNA degradation (Figure 6B and 6C).
Phosphatidylserine translocation from the inner to
the outer leaflet of HT29 plasma membrane was monitored
by staining cells with Annexin V (AV) and 7-AAD prior to
flow cytometry fluorescence analysis (Figure 8C and 8D).
Up to 63% of the cells were stained by AV after 72 h of
treatment by FMUF diluted ½ in DMEM, in comparison
with 7% of AV positive cells in untreated cells (0 h),
suggesting apoptosis induction.
The mitochondrial inner membrane potential ΔΨm,
a crucial parameter in intrinsic apoptosis induction, was
also monitored. We observed an increase in cells exhibiting
a low ΔΨm upon FMUF treatment with time (62%

P. freudenreichii- fermented milk ultrafiltrate
enhances TRAIL cytotoxicity
We investigated the combined cytotoxic effects of
FMUF and several molecules considered for colon cancer
chemotherapy. As shown on Figure 9, cisplatin, etoposide,
oxaliplatin and 5-FU induced a dose-dependent cell
death in HT29 cells in a 24 h treatment, which was little
affected by the addition of FMUF. TRAIL alone had little
effect on cell viability, whatever the tested doses, in 24 h.
Combination of TRAIL with FMUF killed HT29 cells in a
dose-dependent manner. Moreover, whatever the TRAIL
concentration, FMUF enhanced its cytotoxicity.

DISCUSSION
New tools are needed to prevent and/or help
treating CRC acting on diet and efficacy of treatments.
TRAIL induces apoptosis of colon cancer cells both
in vitro and in vivo, via the extrinsic pathway. Clinical
trials demonstrated that rhTRAIL needs to be used
in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs to
expect clinical responses [25]. Dairy propionibacteria,
including Propionibacterium freudenreichii, a foodgrade probiotic bacterium generally recognized as safe,
were previously shown to induce apoptosis in vitro via
the intrinsic death pathway [3] and also in vivo in the
context of carcinogenesis induced by DMH [5]. In this
work, we show for the first time that HT29 human colon
cancer cells co-treated with TRAIL and a supernatant of
propionibacteria, or a mixture of propionate and acetate
(C3/C2), displayed quite similar transcription modulation
pattern, with changes in expression of genes involved in
apoptosis, suggesting a potential synergistic pro-apoptotic
effect of these combinations. Among the pro-apoptotic
genes, TNFRSF10B (alias TRAIL-R2/DR5) was increased
after treatment with SN (+ 3.82 fold change) or C3/C2
(+ 2.02 fold change). Moreover, TRAIL-R2 expression
was shown to be increased on cell membrane of HT29
cells after treatment with supernatant of Pf-fermented
milk ultrafiltrate (FMUF), a dairy product containing
C3/C2. These data are in accordance with the study of
7169

Morales et al., where butyrate, another SCFA, induced
overexpression of the TRAIL-R2 in human leukemic
cells [26]. TRAIL-R2 is predominantly regulated at the
transcriptional level [27]. Such an increase in TRAIL-R2
expression could participate to TRAIL sensitization
induced by SN, C3/C2 or FMUF [28]. The modulation
of the expression of NOD-like receptors and cytokinecytokine receptors at the mRNA level was also observed
in agreement with previous data obtained with HT29 cells
after adhesion of probiotic microbes [19] and with the
immunomodulatory properties of propionibacteria [29].
The cytotoxic and apoptotic assays confirmed
transcriptomic data showing that combination of TRAIL
with SN or C3/C2 has a synergistic cytotoxic activity in
HT29, with increased cytotoxicity via caspase-dependent
apoptosis, in agreement with the apoptotic effect of
TRAIL [8] and of acetate and propionate [3, 30, 31] in
various cell lines. The cell death pathway triggered by the

combinations involved TRAIL death receptors, caspase-3,
-8 and -9 activation and mitochondria, since the use of
blocking antibodies directed against DR4 or DR5, of a
pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) or of Bcl-2 expression
inhibited the pro-apoptotic effect of combination of
TRAIL with SN or C3/C2 in HT29 cells. Finally, the
very low cytotoxic effect of TRAIL in combination with
SN or C3/C2 on normal human intestinal epithelial cells
(HIEC) suggests a possible therapeutic application in
humans. However, overexpression of Bcl-2 in human
colon tumors [32] could be a resistance factor to this kind
of co-treatment.
Interestingly, treatment with SN or a mixture of
propionate and acetate (C3/C2) induced histone H3
acetylation which has already been reported for mixtures
of SCFAs including butyrate, propionate and acetate
[33]. Our data demonstrated that a ratio of propionate
and acetate (30/15 mM) found in propionibacterial

supernatant (SN), is also able to acetylate histone H3 in
the same extent as SN. Histone hyperacetylation has been
linked to inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) by
butyrate [34] leading to growth inhibition [35] and cellcycle arrest [36] with induction of p21, a CDK (CyclinDependent Kinase) inhibitor [37]. Accordingly, our results
clearly showed that p21 protein expression was induced in
HT29 cells treated with SN or C3/C2 and correlated with
increased histone H3 acetylation, suggesting that SN or
mixture of C3/C2 presents a histone deacetylase inhibitory
action as butyrate [38]. In parallel, after a 12 h or 24 h
treatment with SN or C3/C2, expression of two inhibitors
of apoptosis, FLIPL and XIAP, was decreased and could
account for increased apoptosis induced by TRAIL in
combination with SN or C3/C2 since these inhibitors are
both key regulators of extrinsic and intrinsic cell death
pathways, respectively [39]. The protein expression levels
of p21, FLIPL and XIAP, detected by western blot, were

correlated with mRNA levels quantified by microarray
analyses showing, after a 6 h treatment, an increase in
mRNA levels coding for p21 (CDKN1A) by SN (+18.7
fold change) or C3/C2 (+5.5 fold change) and a decrease
in mRNA levels coding for CFLAR (FLIPL) by SN (-2.7
fold change) or by C3/C2 (-3.8 fold change) or for XIAP
by SN (-2.1 fold change). Altogether, these results suggest
that SN or C3/C2 could sensitize colon cancer cells to
TRAIL by an anti-proliferative effect via induction of the
cell cycle p21 inhibitor leading to a G0/G1 arrest and also
by a pro-apoptotic effect via increased expression of DR5
and decreased expression of apoptosis inhibitors (XIAP,
FLIPL). Such an inhibitory effect on FLIPL expression
has already been shown for butyrate treatment in human
colon cancer cells, explaining sensitization of these cells
to TRAIL-induced apoptosis [40]. Downregulation of
FLIPL or XIAP sensitized human colon cancer cells to
TRAIL-induced apoptosis [39]. These modifications of

specific gene expression is a very interesting point in
the objective of cancer therapy since HDAC inhibitors
have been proposed to be associated to TRAIL for
cancer treatment (review in [41]). A report from the
FP6-ONCODEATH research consortium has pointed out
the interest to use TRAIL with other drugs, particularly
HDAC inhibitors [42].
The link established between diet and the occurrence
of CRC strongly suggests that modulation of the diet may
play a role in the prevention of CRC and/or in helping its
treatment. Trials using probiotic products in the context
of CRC treatment have been conducted and revealed a
beneficial impact on chemotherapy side effects [43] and
on post-operative infections [44]. In accordance with
published human studies that report a beneficial effect
of P. freudenreichii consumption on biomarkers of colon
carcinogenesis [45, 46], we propose here to consider dairy
propionibacteria in combination with TRAIL, taking
into consideration that drugs have limited efficacy due to
intrinsic or acquired chemoresistance and monotherapy
using TRAIL has been shown to have no therapeutic
effect in clinical trials [25]. Such beneficial bacteria may
not only enhance tolerance towards treatments, but also
enhanced its efficacy. Propionibacteria main metabolite,
propionate, is a short chain fatty acid with described
effects on histone acetylation, modulation of proliferation/
apoptosis balance, and more recently beneficial effects in
the context of metabolic and inflammatory disorders such
as obesity, diabetes and inflammatory bowel diseases,
through the activation of specific G-protein-coupled
receptors and modification of transcription factors
[47]. We have previously shown that consumption of
Propionibacterium freudenreichii by humans increased the
amount of this probiotics in feces but also increased the
total short chain fatty acids to a concentration of 50 mM
[48]. These propionibacterial metabolites produced in vivo
in the gut [22, 49, 50] accordingly trigger apoptosis [3]
or necrosis in acidic conditions [4] in CRC cells but also
apoptosis in the context of DMH-induced carcinogenesis
in rats [5]. We further showed in this work that, provided
in fermented dairy product, they enhance the pro-apoptotic
effect of TRAIL. This dairy product corresponds to the
ultracentrifugated supernatant, (FMUF) i.e. the fermented
milk aqueous phase, devoid of caseins and of bacteria,
showing that the active compounds are secreted. This
FMUF is used here to mimick the consumption of a
Pf-fermented dairy product. It represents the aqueous
phase of the dairy product released upon degradation
within the stomach and the small intestine. The major
secreted propionibacterial metabolites (propionate and
acetate) and TRAIL both induce apoptosis, but via
different pathways. TRAIL triggers the extrinsic death
receptor pathway and acetate/propionate mixture acts on
cancer cells mitochondria and triggers the intrinsic cell
death cascade (caspase 9 activation, ROS production,
mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cytochrome
c release). Moreover, propionibacterial metabolites induce
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

histone acetylation and modulation of gene expression.
This may explain their synergistic pro-apoptotic effects.
Combination of TRAIL with propionibacterial metabolites
has a great advantage to target several proteins of the
apoptotic pathway (TRAIL-R2/DR5, FLIPL and XIAP),
rather a single gene or protein, possibly making its
anticancer effects more robust. On the other side, the
mitochondrial pathway plays a predominant role in druginduced apoptosis [51] as in SCFA-induced apoptosis
[3], which could explain the absence of synergistic effect
between several anticancer agents and SCFA.
This work opens new perspectives for the
development of specific food products, fermented by
selected pro-apoptotic strains of P. freudenreichii. Such
dairy products, designed for CRC patients, could produce
and deliver SFCA within the colon and thus enhance
efficacy of CRC therapies, especially if based on extrinsic
apoptotic pathway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

iodide), Hoechst H33342, 3,3’-dihexyloxacarbocyanine
iodide (DiOC6(3)) and dihydroethidium (DHE) were
obtained from Invitrogen (Cergy-Pontoise, France).
Annexin V-FITC (AV) kit and 7-aminoactinomycin-D (7AAD) solution were provided by BD Biosciences (Pontde-Claix, France). A pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk,
and z-FA-fmk were obtained from Calbiochem (VWR
International, Fontenay-sous-Bois, France). Bradford
reagent was obtained from Bio-Rad (Marnes-la-Coquette,
France). Proteases inhibitors cocktail and PHOSstop
were obtained from Roche (Roche Applied Science,
Meylan, France). Antagonistic mouse monoclonal
antibodies directed against extracellular domain of human
TRAIL-R1/DR4 and TRAIL-R2/DR5 were from Alexis
Biochemicals and were used for blocking apoptosis or for
studying TRAIL-R1/TRAIL-R2 membrane expression by
flow cytometry as previously described [52].
Antibodies used for immunoblotting were mouse
antibodies to caspase-8 (clone 12F5, Alexis Biochemicals),
cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12, BD Biosciences), Hsc70
(clone B6, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Tebu-bio, Le Perray
en Yvelines, France), p21 (sc-6246, Santa Cruz), PARP-1
(clone 7D3-6, BD Biosciences), FLIP (clone NF6, Alexis

using standard RNA extraction protocols (NucleoSpinR
RNA II). The quality of RNA was checked via the Agilent
2100 Bioanalyzer platform (gel and electropherograms).
In addition to this visual control, the Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer expert software allows the generation of
an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) to check integrity and
overall quality of total RNA samples. All RNA samples
revealed RIN values between 9.7 and 10. Linear T7-based
amplification of 100 ng of each total RNA was performed
and to produce Cy3-labeled cRNA, the RNA samples
were amplified and labeled using the Agilent Low Input
Quick Amp Labeling Kit following the manufacturer’s
protocol. Yields of cRNA and the dye-incorporation rate
were measured with the ND-1000 spectrophotometer
(NanoDrop Technologies). The hybridization procedure
was performed according to the Agilent 60-mer oligo
microarray processing protocol using the Agilent Gene
Expression Hybridization Kit. Briefly, 600 ng Cy3-labeled
fragmented cRNA hybridization in hybridization buffer
was hybridized overnight (17 hours, 65 °C) to Agilent
Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays 8X60K using
Agilent’s recommended hybridization chamber and
oven. Fluorescence signals of the hybridized Agilent
Microarrays were detected using Agilent’s Microarray
Scanner System. The Agilent Feature Extraction Software
(FES) was used to read and process the microarray
image files. The software determines feature intensities
(including background subtraction), rejects outliers and
calculates statistical confidences. For determination of
differential gene expression FES derived output data files
were further analyzed using the Rosetta ResolverR gene
expression data analysis system (Rosetta Biosoftware).
The Resolver Software allowed the export of e gene
list with all normalized sample/control-log10 ratios.
Genes with fold change FC≤2 or FC≥2 and P<0.05 were
considered differentially expressed. The microarray data
were deposited in NCBI GEO data base (GSE67033).

Ressources Microbiennes - Bactéries d'Intérêt Alimentaire,
INRA, Rennes, France). This strain was previously used in
vitro and in vivo and triggered apoptosis [3, 5]. Preparation
of supernatants in DMEM (SN) was previously described
[3] as well as fermented milk (FM) or fermented milk
ultrafiltrate (FMUF) [6]. Production of propionate and
acetate was quantified in SN, FM or FMUF by HPLC as
previously described [3].

Cell death assays

blue colorimetric assay as previously described [6].
Microscopic detection of apoptosis or necrosis was carried
out after nuclear chromatin staining with Hoechst 33342
and propidium iodide (PI) as previously described [53].

Cell death analysis by Annexin V/7-AAD staining
After treatment, cells were stained with Annexin
V-FITC and 7-AAD according to the manufacturer’s
instructions and fluorescence was analysed by flow
cytometry [6].
