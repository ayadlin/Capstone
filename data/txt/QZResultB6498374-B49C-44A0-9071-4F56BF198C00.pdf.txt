ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer patients carrying alterations (i.e., germline mutations, somatic
mutations, hypermethylations and/or deletions) of BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) have
a better prognosis than BRCA1/2 alteration non-carriers. However, patients with wildtype BRCA1/2 may also have a favorable prognosis as a result of other mechanisms
that remain poorly elucidated, such as the deregulation of miRNAs. We therefore
sought to identify BRCA1/2-directed miRNA signatures that have prognostic value in
ovarian cancer patients with wild-type BRCA1/2 and study how the deregulation of
miRNAs impacts the prognosis of patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy.
By analyzing multidimensional datasets of ovarian cancer patients from the TCGA data
portal, we identified three miRNAs (hsa-miR-146a, hsa-miR-148a and hsa-miR-545)
that target BRCA1/2 and were associated with overall survival and progression-free
survival in patients with wild-type BRCA1/2. By analyzing the expression profiles and
Gene Ontology functional enrichment, we found that carriers of BRCA1/2 alterations
and patients with miRNA deregulation shared a common mechanism, regulation of the
DNA repair-related pathways, that affects the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients.
Our work highlights that a proportion of patients with wild-type BRCA1/2 ovarian
cancers benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy and that the patients who benefit
could be predicted from BRCA1/2-directed miRNA signature.

INTRODUCTION

become resistant to subsequent therapy[5, 6].
BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the key genes involved in
the DNA damage response and DNA repair processes,
mainly via homologous recombination[7]. BRCA1 and
BRCA2 work in concert to protect the genome from
double-strand DNA damage during DNA replication.
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in ovarian cancers, are
associated with defects in homologous recombination and
genomic instability. Current researches have demonstrated
a trend towards favorable outcomes in patients who are
deficient in BRCA1 and BRCA2 compared with patients

Ovarian cancer is one of the most fatal malignancies
among women, with high-grade serous ovarian
adenocarcinoma being the leading cause of death[1,
2]. The annual incidence of ovarian cancer varies by
geographical area and by age worldwide[3]. The majority
of ovarian cancer patients succumb to the disease within
5 years of diagnosis[4]. Approximately 80% of ovarian
cancer patients are responsive to treatment with platinumbased drugs. However, most patients will relapse and

with wild-type BRCA1 and BRCA2 as a result of the DNA
damage induced by platinum-based chemotherapy[8,
9]. BRCA-defects include germline mutations, somatic
mutations, hypermethylations and copy number deletions.
Unfortunately, BRCA-deficiency most likely occurs in
only 30% of ovarian cancer patients[8, 10-12].
MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs (~ 22
nucleotides) that regulate target gene expression by
blocking the translation or degradation of their target
mRNAs. Deregulation of miRNAs is involved in the
initiation and progression of ovarian cancer[13]. MiRNAs
participate in a variety of biological processes, such as the
immune response, as well as proliferation and metastasis,
which are hallmarks of cancer[14-16]. The aberrant
expression of miRNAs in cancers indicates their potential
to act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes[17].
Additionally, miRNA expression patterns have been
associated with the prognosis of ovarian cancer[18, 19].
For example, the increased expression of miR-25 has been
closely associated with the poor prognosis of epithelial
ovarian cancer[20], indicating that miR-25 may serve
as a predictive biomarker for the prognosis of epithelial
ovarian cancer. Moreover, miRNAs have been shown
to participate in the DNA repair pathway by regulating
BRCA1/2 during carcinogenesis. Moskwa P et al.
reported that the over-expression of miR-182 inhibited the
expression of the BRCA1 protein and affected homologous
recombination-mediated repair[21]. Sun C et al. reported
that miR-9 mediated the down-regulation of BRCA1 and
impeded DNA damage repair in ovarian cancer[22].
In this paper, the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are
abbreviated as BRCA1/2 for clarity. BRCA1/2-deficient
patients subjected to platinum-based treatment have
significantly improved survival compared with the
patients with wild-type BRCA1/2[9]. However, only a
small proportion of ovarian cancers exhibit direct genetic
or epigenetic alterations in BRCA1/2. By contrast, the
deregulation of miRNAs is an alternative mechanism
that may affect the expression of BRCA1/2 and further
regulate the DNA damage response and DNA repair
pathways. Herein, we hypothesized that ovarian cancer
patients with wild-type BRCA1/2 but with miRNA
deregulation may also have better prognosis than patients
with wild-type BRCA1/2 but no deregulation of miRNA.
Our work sought to identify miRNAs that could predict
the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients who had no
alterations in BRCA1/2 and had initially been treated with
a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Our hypothesis
was that these miRNAs could impede DNA damage repair
by reducing BRCA1/2 expression, thereby increasing the
sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy. We identified
that the up-regulation of three miRNAs (hsa-miR-146a,
hsa-miR-148a and hsa-miR-545), which target BRCA1/2,
in patients with wild-type BRCA1/2 was associated with
good overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival
(PFS), a finding that has important implications for the

clinical management of ovarian cancers.

RESULTS
Survival differences between patients with and

Here,
317
high-grade
serous
ovarian
adenocarcinomas, together with information on mRNA
expression, miRNA expression, mutation, promoter
methylation, DNA copy number and patient clinical
characteristics, were identified in the TCGA data portal[2]
(Table 1). Bolton KL et al. reported that BRCA1 alteration
carriers and BRCA2 alteration carriers show similar
survival patterns[9]. Thus, we combined the data from
patients with somatic or germline mutations, copy number
alterations and/or hypermethylations in BRCA1 or BRCA2
into the group “BRCA1/2 alteration carriers”. BRCA1 and
BRCA2 were altered in 69 and 33 samples, respectively
(Supplementary Table 1). Three samples had both BRCA1
and BRCA2 alterations. The 99 BRCA1/2 alteration
carriers had a significantly better OS (P=3.00E-03; 49.5
vs 41.9 months; log-rank test; Supplementary Figure 1)
than the 218 patients with wild-type BRCA1/2.

Identification of prognostic miRNAs in BRCA1/2
wild-type ovarian cancers
The 218 wild-type BRCA1/2 ovarian cancers were
randomly assigned to a training set (n=109) and a testing
set (n=109). The training set was used to detect prognostic
miRNAs. Fifty-seven miRNAs that are predicted to
target the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 were included in the
analysis. According to a univariate Cox proportional
hazards regression analysis, 3 of the 57 miRNAs were
significantly associated with OS in patients with wild-type
BRCA1/2. We calculated a three-miRNA (hsa-miR-146a,
hsa-miR-148a and hsa-miR-545) signature risk score for
each patient (see Methods). Using the median risk score as
the cutoff, patients were classified into a miRNA-related
high-risk group and a miRNA-related low-risk group.
The patients with low-risk scores were expected to have
better survival outcomes. As a result, the miRNA-related
low-risk group had longer median OS and PFS than did
the miRNA-related high-risk group (P=4.80E-04, median
OS= 52.2 vs 26.9 months; Figure 2A).

score formula, we classified patients in the testing set into a
high-risk group (n=54) and a low-risk group (n=54) using
the same cutoff as in the training set. Consistent with our
findings in the training set, patients in the low-risk group
had a significantly longer median overall survival than did
those in the high-risk group (P=1.45E-02, median OS=
51.9 vs 35.8 months) (Figure 2B). Combining the training
and testing sets, the entire cohort of patients with wildtype BRCA1/2 also yielded similar results (P=2.87E-06,
median OS= 52.2 vs 34.1 months; P=2.67E-04, median
PFS=18.1 vs 12.9 months; Figure 2C). The distribution
of miRNA risk score and miRNA expression is shown in
Figure 3. In the entire wild-type BRCA1/2 set, the miRNAs
were expressed at significantly higher levels in the lowrisk patients than in the high-risk patients (P<0.05).

which stratified the wild-type BRCA1/2 patients into a
complete response (CR) group and a non-CR group, which
included patients with a partial response, stable disease
and progressive disease. The risk score of the threemiRNA signature could further subdivide patients with a
CR into groups with significantly different survival times
(P=0.01, median OS= 32.0 vs 18.5 months, log-rank test;
Supplementary Figure 2). Similarly, even among those
patients with a non-CR, the risk score could be used to
separate patients into two subgroups with significantly
different survival times (P=0.01, median OS= 61.5 vs
48.6 months, log-rank test) (Supplementary Figure 2).
These results suggest that the BRCA1/2-directed miRNA
signature is an independent prognostic factor for ovarian
cancer with wild-type BRCA1/2.

Prognostic differences among the BRCA1/2
alteration carriers, and miRNA-related high-risk
and low-risk patients

We investigated whether the prognostic value
of the BRCA1/2-directed miRNA signature was
independent of other clinical variables. The univariate
and multivariate Cox analysis consistently revealed that
only the BRCA1/2-directed miRNA signature risk score
and the treatment response were significantly associated
with OS (P<0.05) (Table 2). Next, a data stratification
analysis was performed according to treatment response,

The 317 ovarian cancer patients were divided into
three groups: the BRCA1/2 alteration carriers group, the
miRNA-related high-risk group and the miRNA-related
low-risk group. We tested pairwise comparisons of OS
and PFS between the groups using the log-rank test.
The miRNA-related low-risk group had a significantly
better survival than those in the miRNA-related high-risk
group (P=2.87E-06, median OS= 52.2 vs 34.1 months;

MiRNAs and BRCA1/2 expression in ovarian
cancers
According to the miRNA-target regulation data
from the databases (see Methods), hsa-miR-146a is
predicted to target BRCA1 and BRCA2; hsa-miR-545 is
predicted to target BRCA1; and hsa-miR-148a is predicted
to target BRCA2 (Supplementary Figure 3). We found
that the three miRNAs were significantly up-regulated
in the miRNA-related low-risk group compared with the
miRNA-related high-risk group, the BRCA1/2 alteration
carriers, and the normal samples (P<0.01) (Figure 5).
There were no significant differences in the expression

values of the three miRNAs between the miRNA-related
high-risk group and the normal samples (P=0.39 for
hsa-miR-545, P=0.17 for hsa-miR-148a and P=0.25 for
hsa-miR-146a). Additionally, there were no significant
differences in the expression of these miRNAs between
the BRCA1/2 alteration carriers and the normal samples
(P=0.076 for hsa-miR-545, P=0.065 for hsa-miR-148a and
P=0.022 for hsa-miR-146a). Detailed results are shown in
Supplementary Table 2. Those results suggested that the
three miRNAs were deregulated in a portion of the wildtype BRCA1/2 cases and that this deregulation might have
facilitated the good prognosis of these ovarian cancers.
Based on the above analysis, we combined the
BRCA1/2 alteration carriers and miRNA-related lowrisk patients into a good prognosis group, and the
miRNA-related high-risk patients were defined as the
poor prognosis group. We found that although the genes
BRCA1 and BRCA2 trended toward being down-regulated
in the miRNA-related low-risk group compared with
the poor prognosis group, this fell short of significance.
Nevertheless, the expression values of BRCA1 and BRCA2
were significantly lower in the good prognosis group than
in the poor prognosis group (P=1.90E-05 for BRCA1 and
P=1.60E-02 for BRCA2). These results indicate that the
three miRNAs may facilitate a good prognosis for ovarian
cancer by down-regulating BRCA1/2 and deregulating the
DNA repair-related pathways.

Deregulation of BRCA1/2-directed miRNA and
alteration of BRCA1/2 may share a common mechanism
that affects the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients
treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Based on
this hypothesis, we first detected differentially expressed
genes (DEGs) between the miRNA-related low-risk
group and the miRNA-related high-risk group (miRNADEGs) and between the BRCA1/2 alteration carrier group
and the miRNA-related high-risk group (BRCA-DEGs),
respectively. We found that 98% of overlapping genes
between the two DEG lists (miRNA-DEGs and BRCADEGs) were highly consistent in their deregulation
directions (up-regulation or down-regulation). Next, using
functional enrichment analysis, we further investigated
whether the DEGs participated in the DNA repair-related
biological processes derived from the GO database. The
results revealed that the genes in the two DEG lists were
significantly enriched in the DNA repair-related pathways
(Supplementary Table 3) (P<0.05). The pathways most
enriched in BRCA-DEGs were “DNA damage response,
signal transduction by p53 class mediator resulting
in cell cycle arrest” (GO: 0006977, P=8.74E-05) and
“signal transduction involved in mitotic G1 DNA damage
checkpoint” (GO: 0072431, P=8.74E-05). The pathway
most enriched in the miRNA-DEGs was “DNA damage
response, signal transduction by p53 class mediator” (GO:
0030330, P=2.30E-03). Some pathways, such as “signal
transduction in response to DNA damage” (GO: 0042770)

and “DNA damage response, signal transduction by p53
class mediator” (GO: 0030330), were enriched in both the
BRCA-DEGs and miRNA-DEGs. These results suggested
that similar to BRCA1/2 alterations, the deregulation of
miRNAs affected the prognosis of ovarian cancers by
regulating DNA damage response-related pathways.

repair of platinum-induced DNA damage and extracted
151 DNA repair-related genes from the literature[23] .
The three miRNAs (hsa-miR-545, hsa-miR-146a and
hsa-miR-148a) that we identified targeted 29 of these 151
DNA repair genes, and their regulatory relationships were
constructed as a network (Supplementary Figure 3). Six
of the network genes were significantly down-regulated
in the miRNA-related low-risk group compared with the
miRNA-related high-risk group. These results indicate
that the three miRNAs target not only BRCA1 or BRCA2
but also multiple DNA repair pathway genes to response
platinum-based chemotherapy.
Some studies have reported that miRNAs can
impact sensitivity to cancer therapy by targeting BRCA1/2.
Moskwa et al. found that the miR-182-mediated downregulation of BRCA1 affected DNA repair and sensitivity
to inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 in breast
cancer cell lines[21]. miR-9 down-regulated BRCA1 and
impeded DNA damage repair in ovarian cancer cells,
which could improve chemotherapeutic efficacy[22].
Some previous studies have confirmed the relationships
between hsa-miR-146a and BRCA1 and between hsamiR-545 and BRCA1[24, 25]. Our future work will focus
on validating the miRNA-target relationships among
hsa-miR-146a, hsa-miR-148a and BRCA2 and exploring
the effect of deregulation of miRNAs on sensitivity to
platinum-based chemotherapy using wet experiments
on cell lines and clinical samples. Despite the functional
evidence that we have presented, one limitation of our
study is the lack of an independent multidimensional
dataset to validate our conclusion. Nevertheless, the
discovery that miRNAs represent another mechanism
that affects the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients with
wild-type BRCA1/2 may have important implications for
clinical prediction and trial design. Moreover, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are non-protein-coding
transcripts ranging from 200 nucleotides (nt) to ~100
kilobases (kb) in length[26], are frequently aberrantly
expressed in cancers and can be used for cancer diagnosis
and prognosis[27, 28]. However, the roles of lncRNAs in

DISCUSSION
BRCA1 and BRCA2 function at different stages of
the DNA damage response and DNA repair but act in
concert to protect the genome from double-stranded DNA
damage during DNA replication[7]. Our results confirmed
the findings that 30% of ovarian cancer patients carrying
alterations in BRCA1/2 had a better prognosis than
BRCA1/2 alteration non-carriers. However, a proportion
of patients with wild-type BRCA1/2 may also have
favorable prognosis as a result of other mechanisms, such
as the deregulation of miRNAs. In this study, an analysis
of 218 high-grade serous ovarian cancer cases with wildtype BRCA1/2 revealed a BRCA1/2-directed miRNA
signature model. The deregulation of the three miRNAs
(hsa-miR-545, hsa-miR-146a and hsa-miR-148a) was
significantly associated with favorable OS and PFS in
wild-type BRCA1/2 ovarian cancer patients. By analyzing
the expression profiles and GO functional enrichment, we
unraveled that carriers of BRCA1/2 alterations and patients
with miRNA deregulation shared a common mechanism
that affected the prognosis of ovarian cancer treated with
platinum-based chemotherapy. In other words, these
miRNAs also participated in the DNA damage response
and repair-related pathways by regulating BRCA1/2.
In summary, our work identified that some BRCA1/2
alteration non-carriers benefit from platinum-based
chemotherapy, a finding that has potentially important
implications for the clinical management of patients with
ovarian cancer.
Kang et al. showed that some genes that are
differentially expressed between ovarian cancer patients
with poor and favorable outcomes are involved in the

utilizing the median risk score as the cutoff point (lowrisk group was 1, high-risk group was 0). Then, the logrank test was used to assess the overall survival between
the low-risk and high-risk groups. In the Cox analysis,
miRNAs with P<0.05 were selected as signature that were
significantly associated with the OS of ovarian cancer.
Finally, we validated the miRNA risk-prediction model
in the testing set. The 317 ovarian cancer samples from
the TCGA data portal were divided into three groups:
the BRCA1/2 alteration carrier group, the miRNA related
high-risk group and the miRNA related low-risk group.
Kaplan-Meier survival plots and the log-rank test were
used to assess the differences in OS and PFS among the
three groups. Multivariate Cox analysis was applied to
test whether the BRCA1/2-directed miRNA signature was
independent of other clinical characteristics such as age,
tumor grade and so on.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Datasets and processing
317 high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas
and 8 normal fallopian tube samples, including all
information on mRNA expression, miRNA expression,
mutation, promoter methylation, DNA copy number and
clinical features, were downloaded from the TCGA data
portal[2]. The level 3 mutation profile (somatic mutation
and germline mutation information) was used. The level
1 copy number data were processed using the dChip
software, the GLAD algorithm and the GISTIC algorithm,
as described by Gu et al[29]. Level 3 IlluminaInfinium
DNA methylation data were processed as described by
Yang et al[30]. By integrating the discrete mutation profile,
copy number alteration profile and methylation profile,
we obtained the gene alteration profile (Mgs), in which
the columns reflect ovarian cancer samples and the rows
reflect genes. If a gene (g) was detected with alterations
in a sample (s), we set Mgs to 1; otherwise, Mgs was set
to 0 (Figure 1A). Here, alterations in the Mgs included
somatic mutations, germline mutations, copy number
amplifications/deletions and hypo/hyper-methylations.
All patients received platinum-based chemotherapy after
surgery. The detailed clinical features of the patients are
listed in Table 1.
Considering that miRNA targets predicted by
multiple algorithms might be more reliable, we used
miRNA-target interactions appearing in at least two
of nine databases: TargetScan[31], miRanda[32],
PicTar[33], miRBase[34], DIANA-microT[35], PITA[36],
miRNAMap[37], miRTarBase[38] and miRecords[39].

Statistical analysis
A two-sample t-test was performed to identify the
differentially expressed miRNAs or mRNAs in the level 3
miRNA expression profile and level 3 mRNA expression
profile, respectively. The hypergeometric distribution
model was used to test whether the DNA repair-related
terms from the Gene Ontology (GO) database[40] were
significantly enriched in the differentially expressed
genes[41].

patients. The 218 samples with wild-type BRCA1/2 were
randomly divided into a training set (n=109 samples) and
a testing set (n=109 samples). First, in the training set,
the association between the miRNAs targeting BRCA1/2
and survival was assessed by univariate Cox regression
analysis (Figure 1B). Second, a miRNA prediction
classifier was constructed by linear combination of the
expression values of the BRCA1/2-directed miRNAs and
the Cox regression coefficient as the weight. The patients
were classified into high-risk and low-risk groups by
