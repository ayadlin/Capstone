SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Sequencing studies of breast tumor cohorts have identified many prevalent mutations, but provide
limited insight into the genomic diversity within tumors. Here, we developed a whole-genome and
exome single cell sequencing approach called Nuc-Seq that utilizes G2/M nuclei to achieve 91%
mean coverage breadth. We applied this method to sequence single normal and tumor nuclei from
an estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer and a triple-negative ductal carcinoma. In parallel, we
performed single nuclei copy number profiling. Our data show that aneuploid rearrangements
occurred early in tumor evolution and remained highly stable as the tumor masses clonally
expanded. In contrast, point mutations evolved gradually, generating extensive clonal diversity.
Many of the diverse mutations were shown to occur at low frequencies (<10%) in the tumor mass
by targeted single-molecule sequencing. Using mathematical modeling we found that the triplenegative tumor cells had an increased mutation rate (13.3X) while the ER+ tumor cells did not.
These findings have important implications for the diagnosis, therapeutic treatment and evolution
of chemoresistance in breast cancer.

Human breast cancers often display intratumor genomic heterogeneity1–3. This clonal
diversity confounds the clinical diagnosis and basic research of human cancers. Expression
profiling has shown that breast cancers can be classified into five molecular subtypes that
correlate with the presence of estrogen, progesterone and Her2 receptors4. Among these,
triple-negative breast cancers (ER−/PR−/Her2−) have been shown to harbor the largest
number of mutations, while luminal A (ER+/PR+/Her2−) breast cancers show the lowest
frequencies5–7. These data suggest that triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) may have
increased clonal diversity and mutational evolution, but such inferences are difficult to make
in bulk tissues 8,9. To gain better insight into the genomic diversity of breast tumors, we
developed a single cell genome sequencing method and applied it to study mutational
evolution in an ER+ breast cancer (ER) and a TNBC patient. We combined this approach
with targeted duplex10 single-molecule sequencing to profile thousands of cells and
understand the role of rare mutations in tumor evolution.

Whole-Genome Sequencing Using G2/M Nuclei

Author Manuscript

In our previous work we developed a method using degenerate-oligonucleotide-PCR and
sparse sequencing to measure copy number profiles of single cells11. While adequate for
copy number detection, this method could not resolve genome-wide mutations at base-pair
resolution. We attempted to increase coverage by deep-sequencing these libraries, but found
that coverage breadth approached a limit near 10% (Fig. 1a). To address this problem, we
developed a high-coverage, whole-genome and exome single-cell sequencing method called
Nuc-Seq (Extended Data Fig. 1). In this method we exploit the natural cell cycle, in which
single cells duplicate their genome during S phase, expanding their DNA from 6 to 12
picograms prior to cytokinesis. This approach provides an advantage over using chemical
inhibitors to induce polyploidy in single cells12,13 because it does not require live cells.

Author Manuscript

We input four (or more) copies of each single cell genome for whole-genome-amplification
(WGA) to decrease the allelic dropout and false positive error rates, which are major sources
of error during multiple-displacement-amplification (MDA)14,15. Additionally, we limit the
MDA time to 80 minutes to mitigate FP errors associated with the infidelity of the ϕ29
polymerase (Supplementary Methods). The improved amplification efficiency can be shown
using 22 chromosome-specific primer pairs for PCR (Extended Data Fig. 2). In G1/0 single
cells we find that only 25.58% (11/43) of the cells show full amplification of the
chromosomes, while G2/M cells have 45.34% (39/86). After MDA, we incubate the
amplified DNA with a Tn5 transposase, which simultaneously fragments DNA and ligates
adapters for sequencing16. The libraries are then multiplexed for exome capture or used
directly for next-generation sequencing.

Validation in a Monoclonal Cancer Cell Line
To validate our method we used a breast cancer cell line (SK-BR-3) that was previously
shown to be genetically monoclonal11,17. We evaluated the genetic homogeneity of this cell
line using spectral karyotyping and found that large chromosome rearrangements were
highly stable in 85.80% of the single cells (Supplementary Table 1). We also performed
Single-Nucleus-Sequencing (SNS)11,18 on 50 single SK-BR-3 cells and calculated copy

number profiles at 220kb resolution, which showed that the major amplifications of MET,
MYC, ERBB2, BCAS1 and a deletion in DCC were stable (mean R2 = 0.91) in all of the 50
cells (Fig. 1b). Next, we deep-sequenced the population of SK-BR-3 cells (SKP) at high
coverage depth (51X) and breadth (90.40%) and detected single-nucleotide-variants (SNVs),
copy number aberrations (CNAs) and structural variants (SVs) using our processing pipeline
(methods). We filtered the variants using dbSNP135 and identified 409 nonsynonymous
variants and 1,452 structural variants (Fig. 1c), several of which occurred in cancer genes
(Supplementary Table 2).

Author Manuscript

We applied Nuc-Seq to sequence the whole genomes of two single SK-BR-3 cells (SK1 and
SK2) and calculated coverage depth, breadth (sites with at least one read) and uniformity
(evenness). We found that both SK-BR-3 cells achieved high coverage depth (61X ± 5 sem,
n=2) and breadth (83.70% ± 3.40 sem, n=2) (Fig. 1e). In comparison, we re-analyzed
coverage breadth in single cells sequenced by MALBAC19 using unique reads and
calculated 69.54% coverage breadth. We evaluated coverage uniformity using Lorenz
curves20 which showed highly uniform coverage, representing a major improvement over
our previous SNS method11,18 and is equivalent to the MALBAC data19 (Fig. 1d). Next, we
calculated error rates, including the allelic dropout rate (ADR) and false positive rate (FPR)
by comparing single cell variants to the population data (Methods). Our analysis suggests
that Nuc-Seq generates low allelic dropout rates (9.73% ± 2.19%) compared to previous
studies (7–46%)14. We also achieved low false positive error rates for point mutations (FPR
= 1.24e-6), equivalent to 1–2 errors per million bases, which represents a major technical
improvement over previous methods (FPR= 2.52e-5 and 4e-5)14,19.

Population and Single Nuclei Sequencing of an ER Tumor
Author Manuscript

We selected an invasive ductal carcinoma from an estrogen-receptor positive (ER+/PR+/
Her2−) breast cancer patient for population and single cell sequencing (Fig. 2a, methods).
We flow-sorted millions of nuclei from the aneuploid G2/M peak (6N) and from matched
normal tissue for population sequencing (46X and 54X) (Fig. 2b). We also flow-sorted 50
single nuclei for copy number profiling, 4 nuclei for whole-genome sequencing and 59
nuclei for exome sequencing. After filtering germline variants we identified a total of 4,162
somatic SNVs in the aneuploid tumor cell population. Among these SNVs we identified 12
nonsynonymous mutations, which we validated by exome sequencing (66X). Several
nonsynonymous mutations occurred in cancer genes, including PIK3CA, CASP3, FBN2 and
PPP2R5E (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Information). PIK3CA is the most common driver
mutation in luminal A breast cancers7,9.

Author Manuscript

To investigate copy number diversity, we performed SNS11,18 on 50 single nuclei. We
constructed a neighbor-joining tree, which showed that single tumor cells shared highly
similar CNAs (mean R2= 0.89), representing a monoclonal population (Fig. 2d, Extended
Fig. 3a). Next, we performed whole-genome sequencing of four single tumor nuclei at high
coverage breadth (80.79 ± 3.31 sem, n=4) and depth (mean 46.75X ± 5.06 sem, n=4). From
this data we identified three classes of mutations: 1) clonal mutations that were detected in
the population sample and in the majority of single tumor cells, 2) subclonal mutations that
occurred in two or more single cells, but were not detected in the bulk tumor, and 3) de novo

mutations that were detected in only one tumor cell. The de novo mutations are difficult to
distinguish from technical errors and were therefore excluded from our initial analysis. In
total we detected 12 clonal nonsynonymous mutations and 32 subclonal mutations (Fig. 2e).
Many subclonal mutations occurred in intergenic regions; however two mutations
(MARCH11 and CABP2) were found in coding regions (Supplementary Table 4).

Author Manuscript

To identify additional subclonal mutations, we performed single nuclei exome sequencing
on a larger set of cells (47 tumor cells and 12 normal cells). Each nucleus was sequenced at
46.78X (± 4.95, sem, n=59) coverage depth and 92.77%(± 4.85, sem, n=59) coverage
breadth, from which somatic mutations were detected (Supplementary Table 5). The
mutations were clustered and sorted by frequency to construct a heatmap (Fig. 2f). As
expected the 17 clonal mutations identified by population sequencing were present in a
many of the single tumor cells, however we also identified 22 new subclonal mutations. In
contrast, only a single subclonal mutation was detected in the 12 normal cells (Fig. 2f, right
panel).

Population and Single Nuclei Sequencing of a TNBC

Author Manuscript

We then proceeded to analyze a triple-negative (ER−/PR−/Her2−) breast cancer (TNBC)
(Fig. 3a). We performed population sequencing of the bulk tumor (72X) and matched
normal tissue (74X), and identified 374 nonsynonymous mutations. A number of mutations
occurred in cancer genes, including PTEN, TBX3, NOTCH2, JAK1, ARAF, NOTCH3,
MAP3K4, NTRK1, AFF4, CDH6, SETBP1, AKAP9, MAP2K7, ECM2 and ECM1
(Supplementary Table 6) (Fig. 3b). Many of these mutations were previously reported in the
TCGA breast cancer cohort7. Pathway analysis revealed two major pathways that were
disrupted during tumor evolution: TGFβ (p=9.9e-2) and extracellular matrix-receptor
signaling (p=2.7e-2). Copy number profiling identified many chromosomal deletions, in
addition to a focal amplification on chromosome 19p13.2 (Fig. 3b).
To investigate genomic diversity at single-cell resolution, we performed copy number
profiling and exome sequencing. We flow-sorted 50 single nuclei from the H, D and A
ploidy distributions for copy number profiling using SNS (Fig. 3c). Neighbor-joining
revealed two distinct subpopulations of tumor cells (A and H) in addition to the normal
diploid cells (Fig. 3d). The single cell copy number profiles were analyzed using clustered
heatmaps, which showed highly similar rearrangements within each subpopulation (A mean
R2= 0.91, H mean R2 = 0.88), but were distinguished by two large deletions on chromosome
9 and 15 (Extended Data Fig. 3b).

Author Manuscript

Next, we flow-sorted 16 single tumor nuclei from the G2/M peaks (H and A) and 16 single
normal nuclei for exome sequencing using Nuc-Seq (Fig. 3e). Nonsynonymous point
mutations were used to perform hierarchical clustering and multi-dimensional scaling
(MDS). As expected, the 374 clonal nonsynonymous mutations detected by bulk sequencing
were found in the majority of the single tumor cells, however we also identified 145
additional subclonal nonsynonymous mutations that were not detected in the bulk tumor
(Supplementary Table 7). MDS identified 4 distinct clusters, corresponding to three tumor
subpopulations (H, A1 and A2) and the normal cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Hierarchical

clustering showed that many of the subclonal mutations occurred exclusively in one
subpopulation (H, A1 or A2) (Fig. 3e). The A1 subpopulation contained 66 private subclonal
nonsynonymous mutations, including AURKA, SYNE2 and PPP2R1A. The A2 subpopulation
contained 52 private subclonal nonsynonymous mutations includingTGFB2 and CHRM5. In
contrast only two subclonal mutations were shared between the normal cells (Fig. 3e, right
panel). Many of the subclonal mutations (23.44%) were predicted to damage protein
function by both POLYPHEN21 and SIFT22 (Extended Data Fig. 5b).

Single-Molecule Targeted Deep Sequencing

Author Manuscript

To validate the mutations detected by single cell sequencing and determine their frequencies
in the bulk tumor, we performed targeted single-molecule deep-sequencing. Duplex libraries
were constructed from bulk tissue to reduce the error rate of next-generation sequencing10.
Custom capture platforms were designed to target mutations detected in the single cells of
the ER and TNBC tumors (methods). Targeted deep-sequencing (116,952X) was performed
in the ER tumor resulting in a single molecule coverage depth of 5,695X using single-strand
consensus sequences (SSCS). Deep-sequencing of the TNBC (118,743X) resulted in a
single-molecule coverage depth of 6,634X using SSCS (Extended Data Fig. 4). We found
that 61.5% of the reads were in the target regions in the ER tumor and 80.2% in the TNBC.

Author Manuscript

The ER duplex data validated 94.44% (17/18) of the clonal mutations, 90.47% (19/21) of the
subclonal mutations, and 19.40% (26/134) of the de novo mutations detected by single-cell
sequencing (p < 0.01) (methods). The clonal mutations occurred at high frequencies in the
tumor mass, while the subclonal mutations (0.0895 mean) and de novo mutations (0.0195
mean) were very rare (Fig. 4a). Similarly, in the TNBC we validated 99.73% (374/375) of
the clonal mutations, 64.83% (94/145) of the subclonal mutations and 26.99% (152/563) of
the de novo mutations (p < 0.01) (methods). Similarly, we found that the clonal mutations in
the TNBC showed high frequencies (0.4457 mean), while the subclonal mutations were less
prevalent (0.050 mean) and the de novo mutations were very rare (0.00047 mean) (Fig. 4b).
This data suggests that many of the subclonal and de novo mutations are likely to be real
biological variants that occur at low frequencies in the tumor mass.

Mathematical Modeling of the Mutation Rates

Author Manuscript

To estimate the mutation rates in each tumor, we used the single cell mutation frequencies
and designed a mathematical stochastic birth-and-death process model that uses
experimentally derived parameters for cell birth rates (Ki-67 staining), cell death rates
(caspase-3 staining), total tumor cell numbers (flow-sorting cell counts) and the tumor mass
doubling time for invasive carcinomas (mean=168 days)23–25 (methods). We modeled data
for a series of mutation rates and compared the data to the empirical single cell mutation
frequency distributions (Supplementary Table 8). Our data suggest that the ER+ breast
tumor had a mutation rate of MR = 0.6 mutations per cell division for the exome data (Fig.
4c) and MR = 0.9 for the single-cell whole genome data (Fig. 4d). These data are similar to
the error rates reported for normal cells, which are approximately 0.6 mutations per cell
division (error rate = 1e-10) 26–28. In contrast, our modeling suggests a mutation rate of

MR= 8 for the TNBC tumor, suggesting a 13.3X fold increase relative to normal cells (Fig.
4e).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

In this study we report the development of a novel single cell genome sequencing method
that utilizes G2/M nuclei to achieve high-coverage data with low error rates. Although
G2/M nuclei were used in this study, the experimental protocol can also be used to sequence
nuclei at any stage of the cell cycle. We applied Nuc-Seq to delineate clonal diversity and
investigate mutational evolution in two breast cancer patients. Our data clearly show that no
two single tumor cells are genetically identical, questioning the definition of a clone. In both
patients we observed a large number of subclonal and de novo mutations. These data
suggests that point mutations evolved gradually over long periods of time, generating
extensive clonal diversity (Fig. 4f–g). In contrast, the single cell copy number profiles were
highly similar, suggesting that chromosome rearrangements occurred early, in punctuated
bursts of evolution, followed by stable clonal expansions to form the tumor mass (Fig. 4h–i).

Author Manuscript

We previously reported punctuated copy number evolution by sequencing single cells from
a TNBC patient11. This model has also been supported by bulk sequencing data in prostate
cancer29 and in rearrangement patterns called firestorms30 or chromothripsis31. A
punctuated model is consistent with the mechanisms that underlie CNAs, including
chromosome missegregation32, cytokinesis defects and breakage-fusion-bridge33, which can
generate complex rearrangements in just a few cell divisions. In contrast, point mutations
occur through defects in DNA repair or replication machinery34, which accumulate more
gradually over many cell divisions. Our data are consistent with these mechanisms, and
further show that two distinct molecular clocks were operating at different stages of tumor
growth (Extended Data Fig. 6).
A pervasive problem in the field is the inability to validate mutations that are detected in
single cells. To address this problem, we combined single cell sequencing with targeted
single-molecule deep-sequencing. This approach not only validates mutations, but also
measures the precise mutation frequencies in the bulk population. Using this approach, we
identified hundreds of subclonal and de novo mutations that were present at low frequencies
(<10%) in the tumor mass. These rare mutations may play an important role in diversifying
the phenotypes of cancer cells, allowing them to surive selective pressures in the tumor
microenvironment, including the immune system, hypoxia and chemotherapy35,36.

Author Manuscript

A question in the field of chemotherapy is whether resistance mutations are pre-existing in
rare cells in the tumor, or alternatively, emerge spontaneously in response to being
challenged by the therapeutic agent. While this question has been studied for decades in
bacteria37 it remains poorly understood in human cancers. Our data suggest that a large
number of diverse mutations are likely to be pre-existing in the tumor mass, prior to
chemotherapy. Our data also has important implications for the mutator phenotype, which
posits that tumor evolution is driven by increased mutation rates34,38. While TCGA
studies39–41 report increased mutation frequencies, it remains unclear whether these
mutations accumulate over many cell divisions (at a normal error rate) or through an

increased mutation rate. Our TNBC data suggest an increased mutation rate (13.3X) relative
to the normal cells, supporting this model.
On a final note, we expect that single cell genome sequencing will open up new avenues of
investigation in many diverse fields of biology. In cancer research there will be immediate
applications for studying cancer stem cells and circulating tumor cells. In the clinic these
tools will have important applications in early detection and non-invasive monitoring.
Beyond cancer, these tools will have important applications in microbiology, development,
immunology and neuroscience and will lead to vast improvements in our fundamental
understanding of human diseases.
