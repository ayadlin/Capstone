Abstract
STAT3 is an oncogenic transcription factor with potent immunosuppressive functions. We found that pharmacologic inhibition of STAT3 or its selective knockout in cancer cells improved the
tumor growth-inhibitory efﬁcacy of anthracycline-based chemotherapies. This combined effect of STAT3 inhibition/depletion
and anthracyclines was only found in tumors growing on immunocompetent (not in immunodeﬁcient) mice. As compared with
Stat3-sufﬁcient control tumors, Stat3/ cancer cells exhibited an
increased inﬁltration by dendritic cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes after chemotherapy. Anthracyclines are known to induce
several stress pathways that enhance the immunogenicity of dying
and dead cancer cells, thereby stimulating a dendritic cell–dependent and T lymphocyte–mediated anticancer immune response.
Among these therapy-relevant stress pathways, Stat3/ cancer

cells manifested one signiﬁcant improvement, namely an increase
in the expression of multiple type-1 interferon-responsive genes,
including that of the chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10. This enhanced
type-1 interferon response could be suppressed by reintroducing
wild-type Stat3 (but not a transactivation-deﬁcient mutant
Stat3Y705F) into the tumor cells. This maneuver also abolished
the improved chemotherapeutic response of Stat3/ cancers.
Finally, the neutralization of the common type-1 interferon
receptor or that of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 (which binds
CXCL9 and CXCL10) abolished the difference in the chemotherapeutic response between Stat3/ and control tumors. Altogether, these results suggest that STAT3 inhibitors may improve the
outcome of chemotherapy by enhancing the type-1 interferon
response of cancer cells. Cancer Res; 75(18); 3812–22. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

to the capacity of anthracyclines to elicit a series of immunostimulatory stress pathways. Thus, doxorubicin (DOXO), daunorubicin, epirubicin, or mitoxantrone (MTX) induce autophagic stress (which facilitates the lysosomal secretion of ATP,
which then acts on purinergic receptors to attract myeloid cells
into the tumor bed; ref. 2), endoplasmic reticulum stress
(which stimulates the translocation of the "eat-me" signal
calreticulin to the surface of the plasma membrane, where it
facilitates the transfer of tumor antigens to dendritic cells;
ref. 3), the release of HMGB1 from necrotic cells (which
stimulates toll-like receptor 4 on dendritic cells, allowing their
maturation; ref. 4), and the stimulation of a type-1 interferon
response [which results in the autocrine activation of interferon
a/b receptors (IFNAR) for the production of CXCL9 and
CXCL10, which in turn stimulates T lymphocyte inﬁltration
into the tumor; refs. 1, 5]. This compendium of signals and
pathway explains the unique capacity of anthracyclines to
induce anticancer immune responses, both in preclinical models (6, 7) and in breast cancer patients (5, 8).
The transcription factor STAT3 is considered as a bona ﬁde
oncogene because its activation participates in tumorigenesis by
virtue of its capacity to inhibit apoptosis and to stimulate unrestrained advancement through the cell cycle, aerobic glycolysis,
metastasis (9–11). Beyond its capacity to stimulate oncogenesis at
the cell-autonomous level, STAT3 has profound effects on the
tumor microenvironment by stimulating angiogenesis and
inﬂammation and by mediating immunosuppression (10, 12).
Hence, STAT3 activation within tumor cells may contribute to
tumor progression. STAT3 activation occurs in multiple immune

Anthracycline-based chemotherapies can induce immunogenic stress and death in tumor cells, thereby stimulating a
protective anticancer immune response (1). This effect is linked

STAT3 Depletion Enhances Tumor Cell Immunogenicity

cell types as well. In TH17 cells, STAT3 activation stimulates the
expression of the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, hence
augmenting their immunosuppressive actions (13). In Tregs,
STAT3 functionally and physically interacts with FOXP3 (14),
which might explain why STAT3 enhances the function of
FOXP3þ Tregs (15). STAT3 can be activated in distinct myeloid
cell types, including tumor-associated macrophages and myeloidderived suppress cells, stimulating their immunosuppressive
function (16, 17). In dendritic cells, depletion of STAT3 improves
their capacity to present tumor antigens and to stimulate protective anticancer immune responses (18). As a result, inhibition of
STAT3 in both cancer cells and in hematopoietic cells (particularly
myeloid populations) has been attempted to reduce cell-autonomous aspects of cancer and to improve anticancer immune
responses, respectively (18–20). Deletion of the Stat3 gene by
homologous recombination has yielded proof-of-concept that
inhibition of STAT3 can improve cancer immunosurveillance
(18–21). Moreover, it has been attempted to inhibit STAT3 by
RNA interference locally within the tumor (22) or by injecting
small inhibitors that interfere with the transactivation of STAT3
target genes (23, 24). Phase I trials involving small STAT3 inhibitors have been initiated in cancer patients (25–27).
Here, we investigated the possibility of combining anthracyclines with STAT3 inhibition for the treatment of neoplasia. We
found that targeted deletion of Stat3 in cancer cells increases their
therapeutic response to chemotherapy though a mechanism that
is entirely immune-dependent and that speciﬁcally involves an
increased type-1 interferon response.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and plasmids
MCA205 ﬁbrosarcoma cells (H2b) were induced by 3-methylcholanthrene in C57BL/6 mice (28) and were regularly checked
for histocompatibility. Authenticated CT26 colorectal carcinoma
(H2d) cells were obtained from the ATCC, immediately ampliﬁed
to constitute liquid nitrogen stocks and (upon thawing) never
passaged for more than 1 month before use in experimental
determinations. All cell lines were negative for known mouse
pathogens, including mycoplasma. Tumor cells were cultured in
DMEM (containing L-glutamine, high glucose), supplemented
with 10% FBS, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate,
1 mmol/L non-essential amino acids, and 100 U/mL penicillin
and streptomycin. All culture products were from Life Technologies. Mouse cytokine IL6 was purchased from Miltenyi Biotec.
These parental cell lines were used to generate permanent Stat3/
subclones using Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) Technology. Prevalidated CompoZr ZFN plasmids were purchased from SigmaAldrich (Ref: CKOZFN42165-1KT). Plasmids pCS2-YFPC/
mSTAT3wt and pCS2-YFPC/mSTAT3Y705F were kindly provided
by Pr. Pravin B. Sehgal, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY.
Ifnar/ MCA205 was generated with ZFN technology as
described before (5).
Stat3/ tumor cell line generation and transfection
To generate Stat3-deﬁcient MCA205 and CT26 cells, prevalidated CompoZr ZFN plasmids were incorporated into parental
cell lines with FuGENE HD reagent (Promega), together with the
pcDNA3.1 (þ) vector (Life Technology), which conferred the
cotransfected cells a temporary neomycin resistance. Forty-eight
hours after transfection, G418 (Geneticin 0.5 mg/mL; Life Tech-

www.aacrjournals.org

nology) was applied for 2 days to select transfectants. The cotransfection strategy was applied due to the low transfection efﬁciency
of parental cell lines. After a recovery period of 4 days, part of the
transfectants was subjected to mismatch-speciﬁc nuclease assay
with a Surveyor mutation detection kit (Transgenomics) to verify
the ZFN activity according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief,
genomic DNA was extracted with a Kapa DNA extraction kit (Kapa
Biosystems). Genomic region surrounding the Stat3 ZFN target
site was ampliﬁed with PCR using these primers: forward:
50 -GGAGAATGGGTTTGCAGTGT-30 ; reverse: 50 -ACCTTTGGGAAAAAGGGAAA-30 . The PCR products were incubated in boiling
water and slowly cooled to room temperature for reannealing.
Reannealed PCR products were treated with SURVEYOR nuclease
and SURVEYOR enhancer S in 42 C for 30 minutes and analyzed
on 2% agarose gel with SYBR gold nucleic acid gel stain (Life
Technology). Transfectants bearing DNA mismatches were used
to perform single-cell sorting into 96-well plates, using BD FACSAria III sorter in the CICC platform, Centre de Recherche des
Cordeliers (CRC), Paris, France. All clones formed were screened
with immunoblots for the expression level of STAT3 protein. To
introduce wild-type (WT) or mutated Stat3 into Stat3/ clones,
pCS2-YFPC/mSTAT3wt and pCS2-YFPC/mSTAT3Y705F plasmids
were transfected separately to the Stat3/ MCA205. YFP-positive
clones were enriched with BD FACSAria III sorter.
Tumor models
Na€ve female WT C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (aged between 6–8
weeks), which are MHC-haplotype compatible with MCA205 and
CT26 cell lines, respectively, were purchased from Harlan. Female
nude mice were bred in the animal facility of Institut Gustave
Roussy. WT or corresponding Stat3/ tumor cells were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c. 5  105 cells in 100 mL per mouse) in
the thigh of host mice. Chemotherapy was administered when
tumor size reaches 20 to 45 mm2 (normally 6 to 8 days after tumor
cell injection), either by one single intratumoral (i.t.) injection of
DOXO (2.9 mg/kg in 50 mL PBS) or by i.p. injection of MTX (5.2
mg/kg in 200 mL PBS). In some experiments, mice also received
the STAT3 inhibitor Stattic i.t. (10 mg/kg or vehicle control, one
injection together with DOXO). When appropriate, mice were
treated with blocking antibodies (10 mg/kg per injection) against
CXCR3 (InVivoMAb; Clone: CXCR3-173; BioXcell) or IFNAR
(InVivoMAb; Clone: MAR1-5A3; BioXcell) intravenously on days
0, 2, 4, and 7 after chemotherapy. Tumor diameters (the longest
diameter and the diameter in its orthogonal direction) were
measured 2 to 3 times per week with calipers and recorded as
tumor surface (mm2). DOXO and MTX were from Sigma-Aldrich.
Stattic was from Tocris Bioscience.
ATP release quantiﬁcation
Tumor cell lines were seeded at 3  104 cells/well in 24-well
plate on day 1. On day 2, the medium in all wells was replaced
with prewarmed fresh medium (300 mL/well), with or without 2
mmol/L MTX. Twenty-four hours after, supernatants were collected, spun at 500  g to remove cell debris and used freshly to dose
ATP release with ENLITEN ATP Assay System (Promega; FF2000).
Chemiluminescence signals were measured with a VICTOR X
multilabel reader (PerkinElmer). Alternatively, cells were seeded
at 6  104 cells/well in 12-well plates on day 1. On day 2, the
medium in all wells was replaced with prewarmed fresh medium
(800 mL/well), with or without 2 mmol/L MTX. Twenty-four hours
after, trypsinized cells and their original supernatant were

collected and combined in Facon tubes, spun at 1,500 rpm for 10
minutes. The pellets were resuspended directly in Krebs-Ringer
buffer (125 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCl, 1 mmol/L MgSO4, 0.7
mmol/L KH2PO4, 2 mmol/L CaCl2, 6 mmol/L D-glucose, and 25
mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 2 mmol/L quinacrine, incubated at 37 C for 30 minutes. After one wash with Krebs-Ringer
buffer, cell pellets were resuspended in PBS containing 2 mg/mL
DAPI and tested with ﬂow cytometry (MACSQuant Analyzer;
Miltenyi). Data were analyzed with Flowjo software (Treestar
Inc.). All chemicals were from Sigma Aldrich. DAPI was from
Molecular Probes, Life Technologies.
Cell death, calreticulin exposure, and HMGB1 release
Cell lines were seeded and treated with MTX (the same conditions as for the quinacrine assay) for indicated durations. Early or
late apoptosis was analyzed with DAPI and Annexin V staining
(BD Pharmingen) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Calreticulin exposure was determined by surface staining using
rabbit monoclonal antibody (used at dilution 1:500; clone
EPR3924; Ref:AJ1124a; ABGENT), followed by staining with
Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (HþL) secondary antibody
(used at dilution 1:500; Life Technologies). For the HMGB1
release assay, cell lines were seeded and treated with MTX in the
same condition as the ENLITEN ATP Assay. Supernatants were
collected at 24 hours, spun to remove cell debris, and then used
freshly in ELISA-based quantiﬁcations (IBL International GMBH;
Ref ST51011). Plates were read with a VICTOR X multilabel reader
(PerkinElmer).
RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and qRT-PCR
Cells were seeded in 12-well plates (same conditions as for
the quinacrine assay) and treated with 2 mmol/L MTX or 1,000
U/mL mouse IFNa (Miltenyi) for 16 hours. Trypsinized cells
and their original supernatant were collected and spun at 300 
g for 10 minutes. The cell pellets were lysed directed with 350
mL RLT buffer (QIAGEN) containing 2-mercaptoethanol
(b-ME). Total RNA was extracted from cell lysates using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN), and 3 mg of RNA was used in
reverse transcription to cDNA with SuperScript III First-Strand
System (Life Technologies). Type I IFN-related gene expression
was quantiﬁed with prevalidated TaqMan Gene Expression
Assays, using Universal Master Mix II (with UNG) on the
StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (all from Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies).
Tissue sections and immunoﬂuorescent staining
Tumors were harvested on days 2 and 7 after chemotherapy
(MTX, i.p.) and used to analyze dendritic cell and T-cell inﬁltration, respectively. Tumors were ﬁxed at room temperature
with 10% neutral buffered formalin (CellStorTM pots, from
CellPath) for 4 hours and transferred into 30% saccharose in
PBS at 4 C for 24 hours. The remaining liquid on the tumors
was wiped off before tumor was embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T.
Compound (Sakura). Samples were frozen at 80 C immediately and transferred to 20 C before cutting them by means of
a Leica CM 3050S Cryostat. Consecutive tissue sections (5 mm)
were performed using poly-L-lysine–coated slides. Immunoﬂuorescence stainings were performed as described (29), with the
following antibodies: CD11c-Alexa Fluor 488 (N418), CD86AlexaFluor 647 (GL-1), CD8a-Alexa Fluor 488 (53-6.7),
and CD3-Alexa Fluor 547 (17A2) from BioLegend; cleaved

Western blot
Cells collected from 6-well plates were lysed with 100 mL lysis
buffer/well (containing cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail;
Roche) on ice for 30 minutes. Cell lysates were spun at 12,000
 g for 20 minutes to obtain clear supernatant, which were
further supplemented with NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer and
Sample Reducing Agent before boiling for 5 minutes. Protein
migration was performed with NuPAGE Novex 4% to 12% BisTris Protein Gels under 100 V constant voltage. For detecting
LC3B, a prerun step (protein non-loaded gel under 80 V, 30
minutes) was required. Proteins on the gel were transblotted
onto nitrocellulose membranes under 100 V constant voltage
for 90 minutes on ice. The membranes were blocked with 5%
non-fat milk in 1 TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (1  TBST)
and incubated with primary antibodies: for LC3B (ab51520;
Abcam) and STAT3 (REF:610189; BD Biosciences), overnight,
1:500 dilution; for b-actin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP; ab49900; Abcam), 1 hour at room temperature,
1:10,000 dilution. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
(SouthernBiotech) were used at 1:5,000. After repeated washing with 1 TBST, bands were visualized with ECL Western
Blotting Detection Reagent (Amersham, GE Healthcare) using
ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare). All reagents were from
Life Technologies if not speciﬁed.
Quantiﬁcation of LC3 dots
WT or Stat3/ MCA205 cells were infected with lentivirus
encoding LC3-GFP (EMD Millipore), and GFPþ cells were
enriched by means of a BD FACSAria III sorter. Cells were seeded
in BD high-content imaging plates. After the indicated treatment,
images were collected with the BD Pathway 855 high-content
bioimager (BD Biosciences), and GFP-LC3-labeled puncta were
analyzed.
Statistical analyses
All results were presented as mean  SEM of 3 to 6 parallel
assessments. Similar results were obtained from at least twice
independent experiments. Statistical differences were determined
using unpaired, two-tailed Student t test or Mann–Whitney U test.
Statistical analyses and histogram generation were performed by
software GraphPad Prism 5.

Results
Immune-dependent amelioration of chemotherapy by tumor
cell–autonomous inhibition of STAT3
In response to the anthracycline DOXO, MCA205 ﬁbrosarcomas
implanted in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice reduced their growth. Local
injection of the STAT3 inhibitor Stattic (30) failed to affect tumor
progression on its own, yet enhanced the tumor growth-reducing
activity of DOXO (Fig. 1A). This combination effect entirely
depended on a T lymphocyte–mediated anticancer immune
response, because MCA205 ﬁbrosarcomas implanted in athymic
nu/nu mice failed to reduce their growth in response to either
DOXO alone or the combination of DOXO plus Stattic (Fig. 1B).
We used zinc ﬁnger nuclease technology to generate several
independent clones of MCA205 ﬁbrosarcomas and CT26

Stat3/ cancer cells showed a reduced apoptotic response to the
anthracycline MTX in vitro (Fig. 2B and C). Nonetheless, if
implanted into immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, Stat3/
MCA205 ﬁbrosarcomas exhibited a largely improved chemotherapeutic response to DOXO or MTX in vivo (Fig. 2D). Similarly,
Stat3/ CT26 cells growing on immunocompetent syngeneic
BALB/c mice exhibited a more vigorous reduction in tumor
growth upon anthracycline-based chemotherapy than did
Stat3-sufﬁcient WT control cells (Fig. 2E). The improved chemotherapeutic response of Stat3/ cancer cells was not observed in
the context of a T-cell–deﬁcient immune system, in nu/nu mice
(Fig. 2F), supporting the contention that depletion of Stat3 at the
level of the tumors improves the efﬁcacy of anthracyclines in an
entirely immune-dependent fashion.

CXCL10) subsequent to an type-1 interferon response (1, 5).
Anthracyclines could induce STAT3 phosphorylation in
MCA205 cells in vitro, and this effect was lost in Ifnar1-deﬁcient
cells, indicating that anthracyclines can activate STAT3 in an
IFNAR1-dependent fashion (Supplementary Fig. S1). Although
Stat3 depletion can stimulate autophagy in some cell lines
(29), we found no indication that Stat3/ MCA205 cells would
undergo more autophagy, either in baseline conditions or upon
stimulation (Supplementary Fig. S2). Accordingly, Stat3/
MCA205 cells released normal amounts of ATP in response
to MTX, as indicated by the measurement of extracellular ATP
(Fig. 3A) or that of residual ATP content in the cells after
stimulation (Fig. 3B and C). Similarly, Stat3/ MCA205 cells
cultured with MTX released normal amounts of HMGB1
(Fig. 3D). Calreticulin exposure could be induced by MTX in
WT and in Stat3/ MCA205 cells, although the latter exhibited
a reduced calreticulin exposure (Fig. 3E), correlating with
their reduced apoptotic response (Fig. 2B and C; see above).
In sharp contrast, Stat3/ MCA205 cells exhibited a marked

to the type-1 interferon gene Ifnb1 itself, the transcription factor
Irf7, the antiviral genes Oas2, Mx1, Mx2, the gene coding for the
pattern recognition receptor Dhx58, a number of other type-1
interferon-induced genes (such as Iﬁ205, Iﬁt2, and Rsad2), as
well as to the chemokine-encoding genes Cxcl9 and Cxcl10,

impact of STAT3, ﬁrst on the capacity of anthracyclines to
induce type-1 interferons and then the capacity of type-1
interferons to stimulate the expression of downstream target
genes. Irrespective of this speculation, it appears that the only
known hallmark of anthracycline-induced immunogenicity
that is positively affected by Stat3 depletion is the type-1
interferon response.

Enhanced local immune response of Stat3/ tumor cells
responding to anthracyclines
In response to anthracyclines, cancers growing on immunocompetent mice exhibit a major alteration in their immune
inﬁltrate. Within 48 hours after chemotherapy, the frequency of
activated dendritic cells with a CD11cþCD86þ phenotype
increases, in particular in the vicinity of apoptotic cancer cells
staining positively for activated, proteolytically mature caspase-3
(Casp3a), as determined by multicolor immunoﬂuorescence,
followed by microscopic quantitation (Fig. 4A; refs. 31, 32). In
spite of the fact that Stat3/ MCA205 are less prone to undergo
apoptosis in response to anthracyclines in ex-vivo culture (Fig. 2C
and D), the frequency of Casp3aþ cells was higher in Stat3/
MCA205 tumors than in WT tumors after chemotherapy with
MTX (Fig. 4A and B). Similarly, the frequencies of CD11cþ cells
and, more so, that of CD11cþ CD86þ mature dendritic cells were
higher in Stat3/ cancers than in Stat3-sufﬁcient WT controls, 48
hours after chemotherapy (Fig. 4C and D). Detection of T cells
(which are CD3þ), in particular cytotoxic T lymphocytes (which
are CD3þ CD8þ), by in situ immunoﬂuorescence staining (Fig.
4E) revealed similar signs of an increased anticancer immune
responses in response to the combination of STAT3 inhibition
and chemotherapy. After anthracycline-based chemotherapy,
Stat3/ cancers manifested a more dense inﬁltration by T cells
(Fig. 4F) and, more speciﬁcally, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Fig. 4G)
than did control tumors. Altogether, these results conﬁrm the idea
that the combination of anthracycline plus Stat3 depletion can
stimulate a particularly vigorous immune-mediated chemotherapeutic response.
Cause–effect relationship between the Stat3-regulated type-1
interferon response and the improved efﬁcacy of anthracyclines
If STAT3 inhibited the local immune response by virtue of
its function as a transcription factor, transfection of Stat3/
cancer cells with Stat3 should reverse the phenotype, whereas
reintroduction of a nonphosphorylatable (Y705F) mutant of
Stat3 (in which the tyrosine in position 705 has been exchanged
by a phenylalanine, abolishing its dimerization and hence
its transactivation capability; ref. 33) should not be able to do
so. Accordingly, we found that restoration of Stat3/ cancer
cells with WT Stat3 but not with Stat3Y705F reversed the
improved chemotherapeutic response to anthracyclines in vivo
(Fig. 5). Reintroducing WT Stat3 also suppressed the exacerbated type-1 interferon response of Stat3/ cancer cells
responding to MTX in vitro, in conditions in which Stat3Y705F
failed to do so (Fig. 6A). These results support the possibility
that it is indeed the increased type-1 interferon response that
accounts for the therapeutic effect of Stat3 depletion combined
with chemotherapy.
To further explore this possible cause–effect relationship, we
treated mice carrying Stat3/ MCA205 cancers with antibodies
that neutralize either one of the two subunits of the heterodimeric type-1 interferon receptor (IFNAR1), or the CXCR3
chemokine receptor (that mediates T-cell inﬁltration of cancers
in response to the chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10). Both
receptor-blocking antibodies reduced the efﬁcacy of chemotherapy against Stat3/ cancers and actually eliminated the
difference in the therapeutic response between WT and Stat3/
tumors. Altogether, these results suggest that the elevated type1 interferon response of Stat3/ cancers explains their
improved response to anthracyclines.

Discussion
In this article, we provide evidence that STAT3 inhibition can
synergize with anthracyclines to mediate anticancer effects in
preclinical models. Previous studies that were mostly performed
in vitro, on cultured human cancer cell lines, suggested that STAT3
activation by anthracyclines may mediate chemoresistance,
meaning that inhibition of STAT3 enhances the direct cytotoxic
effects of DOXO (34–37). Seemingly corroborating this possibility, we found that anthracycline-based chemotherapy was more
efﬁcient against mouse tumor if it was combined with inhibition
or deletion of STAT3.
Nonetheless, careful analyses revealed an unexpected mechanism for the synergistic therapeutic interaction between STAT3
inhibition and chemotherapy in preclinical mouse models.
STAT3 inhibition did not increase the direct cytotoxic action of
anthracyclines on mouse tumor cells in vitro. The synergistic effect
was only observed in vivo, on tumors that were growing in fully
immunocompetent mice, not in mice lacking thymus-dependent
T lymphocytes. Hence, the positive interaction between STAT3
inhibition and anthracycline must be dictated by the immune
system. Accordingly, Stat3 depletion and chemotherapy together
induced signs of an increased anticancer immune response consisting in a denser inﬁltration of the tumors by mature dendritic
cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Inhibition of STAT3 alone did
not cause any sizeable increase in the immune inﬁltrate. However,
after chemotherapy, Stat3/ cancers exhibited a signiﬁcantly
stronger immune inﬁltrate than WT tumors. Shortly (48 hours)
after chemotherapy, Stat3/ tumors also contained more apoptotic cells than Stat3-sufﬁcient control neoplasias. It is tempting
to speculate that this enhanced apoptosis reﬂects the enhanced
activity of immune effectors in the tumor bed.
As mentioned in the introduction to this article, anthracyclines
can stimulate anticancer immune responses through their capacity
to elicit several immunostimulatory stress pathways that collectively mediate the phenomenon of immunogenic cell death (ICD).
A systematic analysis of all known ICD-related pathways led to the
conclusion that only one among them, namely the one linked to
the induction of type-1 IFN-related genes, was overinduced in
Stat3/ cancer cells. Stat3-deﬁcient hepatocellular carcinoma and
follicular helper T cells exhibit increased expression of type-1
interferon-inducible gene (38), in line with a model that STAT3
and type I IFN signaling pathway are mutually repressive (39). In
viral infection models, the absence of STAT3 led to hyperactivation
of ISGF3 (STAT1:STAT2:IRF9) complex and hence augmented type
I IFN response (40, 41). However, at present it is not known
through which detailed molecular mechanisms, STAT3 inhibition
ampliﬁes the induction of type-1 interferon-inducible genes by
anthracyclines. Hence, this effect of STAT3 inhibition requires
further mechanistic exploration. In line with one previous report
(42), this effect is related to the transcriptional activity of STAT3,
because a mutant that lacks transactivation potential was unable to
repress the type I IFN response. The amplitude of the stimulatory
effect of Stat3 deletion on type-1 interferon-inducible genes is
clearly higher when MTX rather than puriﬁed IFNa is used as a
stimulus. This suggests that the initial events triggered by anthracyclines, including the stimulation of pattern recognition receptors
(such as TLR3; ref. 5), are somehow favored by Stat3 deletion, yet
requires further mechanistic exploration. Thus, in response to
anthracyclines, Stat3/ cancer cells produced signiﬁcantly more
of the immunostimulatory CXCR3 ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10,

while this difference was not detectable upon stimulation with

The favorable interaction of STAT3 inhibition with anthracycline-based chemotherapy was lost in the absence of thymusdependent lymphocytes, as well upon the neutralization of the
common type-1 interferon receptor or that of the chemokine
receptor CXCR3 (which binds CXCL9 and CXCL10). These latter
results establish the cause–effect relationship between the exacerbated type-1 interferon-related response and the efﬁcacy of the
combined treatment with anthracyclines and STAT3 inhibition.

Based on these results, it may be interesting to combine STAT3
inhibitors and anthracyclines (or other immunogenic cell inducers including radiotherapy) in future clinical trials. In such trials,
the type-I interferon response should be assessed as a possible
predictive biomarker. It may be particularly interesting to use
STAT3 inhibitors against tumors that, at difference with those
investigated in this article, are "addicted" to STAT3 and hence
require STAT3 for their survival and proliferation. In such a case,
the cell-autonomous and the immunological effects of STAT3
may add up in an advantageous fashion.
