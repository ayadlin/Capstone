Abstract

Author Manuscript

Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 regulates many cardinal features of
cancer including cancer cell growth, apoptosis resistance, DNA damage response, metastasis,
immune escape, tumor angiogenesis, the Warburg effect, and oncogene addiction and has been
validated as a drug target for cancer therapy. Several strategies have been employed to identify
agents that target Stat3 in breast cancer but none has yet entered into clinical use. We used a highthroughput fluorescence microscopy search strategy to identify compounds in a drug-repositioning
library (Prestwick library) that block ligand-induced nuclear translocation of Stat3 and identified
piperlongumine (PL), a natural product isolated from the fruit of the pepper Piper longum.
Piperlongumine inhibited Stat3 nuclear translocation, inhibited ligand-induced and constitutive
Stat3 phosphorylation, and modulated expression of multiple Stat3-regulated genes. Surface
plasmon resonance assay revealed that piperlongumine directly inhibited binding of Stat3 to its

phosphotyrosyl (pY) peptide ligand. Phosphoprotein antibody array analysis revealed that PL does
not modulate kinases known to activate Stat3 such as JAKs, Src kinase family members, or RTKs.
PL inhibited anchorage-independent and anchorage-dependent growth of multiple breast cancer
cell lines having increased pStat3 or total Stat3, and induced apoptosis. PL also inhibited
mammosphere formation by tumor cells from patient derived xenografts (PDX). PL’s antitumorigenic function was causally linked to its Stat3-inhibitory effect. PL was non-toxic in mice
up to a dose of 30 mg/Kg/day for 14 days and caused regression of breast cancer cell line
xenografts in nude mice. Thus, PL represents a promising new agent for rapid entry into the clinic
for use in treating breast cancer, as well as other cancers in which Stat3 plays a role.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is a member of a family of seven
closely related proteins responsible for transmission of peptide hormone signals from the
extracellular surface of cells to the nucleus 1. Stat3 was subsequently demonstrated to be a
master regulator of several key hallmarks and enablers of cancer cells 2–5 including cell
proliferation 6, resistance to apoptosis 7, metastasis 2, immune evasion 8, tumor
angiogenesis 9, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) 10, response to DNA damage 11,
and the Warburg effect 12. In addition, Stat3 is a key mediator of oncogene addiction in
several types of tumors 13. In breast cancer, Stat3 activity is increased in the self-renewing
CD44+CD24− tumor initiating cell population where it contributes to cancer initiation,
maintenance and relapse 14–16. Thus, Stat3 is an attractive target for anti-cancer drug
development, including treatment for breast cancer.
Peptide hormone binding to growth factor or cytokine receptors 17, 18 causes receptor
oligomerization and activation of intrinsic or receptor-associated tyrosine kinases,
respectively. These activated kinases phosphorylate receptor tyrosine residues creating
docking sites for recruitment of cytoplasmic Stat3 17, 18. Stat3 docks to receptor
phosphotyrosyl (pY) peptide sites through its Src-homology (SH) 2 domain, which leads to
its phosphorylation on Y705 followed by Stat3 tail-to-tail homodimerization (SH2 domain of
each monomer binds the pY705 peptide domain of its partner). Stat3 homodimers
accumulate in the nucleus, where they bind to specific Stat3 response elements in the
promoter of target genes and regulate their transcription.

Stat3 activity is increased in ~50% of all cancers 19. While increased Stat3 activity in human
cancers can result from naturally occurring Stat3 mutations, e.g. human inflammatory
hepatocellular adenomas and large granular lymphocytic leukemia 20, 21, it more commonly
results from activation of upstream receptor tyrosine-kinases (RTK), e.g. epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR), or tyrosine-kinase associated receptors e.g. the family of IL-6–type
(IL-6) cytokine receptors, or G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) 17, 18, 22, 23. In addition,

members of the Src kinase family such as Src, Lck, Hck, Lyn, Fyn, or Fgr can activate Stat3
either directly or downstream of an RTK or GPCR 22, 23.
Several small molecule drug-development programs have emerged directed at identifying
drug-like compounds that target Stat3. These programs have targeted either the Stat3
homodimer or the Stat3 SH2 domain 24–27 While these programs have identified drug-like
candidates that show activity in cell-based assays and pre-clinical cancer models, none has
yet entered into clinical use.

Author Manuscript

In an effort to fill this clinical need, we employed a single-cell, high throughput fluorescent
cell based assay to screen the Prestwick drug-repositioning chemical library for compounds
with ability to block nuclear accumulation of ligand-activated GFP-Stat3. This screen
identified piperlongumine (PL), an alkyl amide, and an active component of the long pepper
(Piper longum) fruit, used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to treat a variety of illnesses
including stomach ulcers, tumors and circulatory problems. PL inhibited Stat3 cytoplasmicto-nuclear translocation and ligand-mediated activation of Stat3 phosphorylation and
reduced constitutive Stat3 phosphorylation in breast cancer cell lines, mediating its effect by
inhibiting Stat3 binding to its pY-peptide ligand. PL reduced levels of Stat3 target genes in
breast cancer cells, inhibited anchorage-dependent and independent growth of breast cancer
cells, inhibited mammosphere formation by patient-derived human breast cancer xenografts
that expressed moderate-to-high levels of constitutively activated Stat3, and inhibited
growth of breast cancer line xenograft tumors in nude mice. Thus, PL represents a promising
new agent for potential hit-to-lead development and rapid entry into the clinic for use in
treating breast cancer, as well as other cancers in which Stat3 plays a role.

RESULTS
HTFM screening of the Prestwick chemical library identified piperlongumine as a potent
inhibitor of ligand-stimulated Stat3 nuclear translocation
Screening of the Prestwick chemical library identified 6 compounds that inhibited Stat3α
nuclear translocation. Out of these, three were cytotoxic drugs used in chemotherapy; the
other three were chrysene 1,4 quinone (IC50=10 μM), merbromin (IC50=10 μM), and
piperlongumine (IC50=1.7 μM; Figure 1A, 1C and Table 1), Chrysene is a weakly
carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon 28. Merbromin/Mercurochrome is an
organomercuric disodium salt. Piperlongumine is an alkyl amide isolated from the long
pepper (Piper longum) fruit, which has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to
treat a variety of illnesses including stomach ulcers, tumors and circulatory problems.

Two isoforms of Stat3 (α/p92 and β/p83), resulting from alternative splicing, are present
within cells at a 4:1 ratio 29. We previously demonstrated that both isoforms exhibited
similar dynamics of nuclear accumulation in MEF cells following stimulation with IL-6/
sIL-6Rα 30. To determine if PL inhibited nuclear translocation of Stat3β in addition to
Stat3α, we used stably expressing MEF/GFP-Stat3β in HTFM assay. PL blocked ligandinduced nuclear translocation of GFP-Stat3β cells with an IC50 similar to that in GFP-Stat3α
cells (IC50 = 0.9 ± 0.6 μM; Figure 1B and 1C; Table 1).

Piperlongumine inhibits ligand-stimulated phosphorylation of Stat3 in the myeloid
leukemia cell line, Kasumi-1, and in breast cancer cell lines, and rapidly decreases
constitutive phosphorylation of Stat3 in breast cancer cell lines through inhibition of Stat3
binding to its pY-peptide ligand
Nuclear accumulation of Stat3 is facilitated by its phosphorylation on Y705. To assess if PL
inhibited ligand-mediated Stat3 phosphorylation, we examined the ability of PL to inhibit GCSF-induced Stat3 phosphorylation of the myeloid leukemia cell line, Kasumi-1, by
phosphoflow. PL potently inhibited G-CSF-induced Stat3 phosphorylation (IC50 = 3.7 ± 1.7
μM; Figure 2 and Table 1).

Stat3 is constitutively phosphorylated in multiple cancers, including breast cancer2. We
examined levels of pStat3 in a panel of breast cell lines (Figure 3A). The non-tumorigenic
epithelial breast cell lines (MCF-10A and MCF-12A) and six breast cancer cell lines
(MCF-7, T47D, ZR-75-1, BT-474, MDA-MB 453 and SK-BR-3) had low levels of pStat3
while five cell lines (Hs578T, HCC-1954, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and Sum159PT)
had high pStat3 levels. PL treatment of two of the breast cancer cell lines with high
constitutive levels of pStat3, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, for 1.5 hr reduced pStat3
levels in each by >70% (Figure 3C, D and Table 1; IC50=0.4–2.8 μM) without substantially
affecting levels of total Stat3 or pStat1, pStat5 and total Stat1 (Figure 3E). To determine the
kinetics of reduction of constitutive pStat3 by PL, we treated MDA-MB-468 cells with PL
(30 μM) for 15′ - 24 hrs and determined pStat3, total Stat3, and GAPDH (Figure 3F). Levels
of pStat3 were reduced by >50% as early as 15 min and maximally reduced by 30 min.

Author Manuscript

We also tested PL’s effect Stat3 phosphorylation induced by IL-6 plus sIL-6Rα in three
pStat3-low breast cancer cell lines MCF7, MDA-MB-453 and T47D (Figure 3G). IL-6/
sIL6Rα treatment (@ 150ng/ml for 20 minutes) increased the pStat3 levels by 6.8, 14.9 and
26.6 fold in MCF-7, MDA-MB-453 and T47D cells, respectively (data not shown). PL pretreatment for 2 hours completely blocked the ability of IL6/sIL6R to stimulate Stat3
phosphorylation in MCF-7 (IC50 = 0.9 μM; Figure 3G and Table 1), MDA-MB-453 (IC50 =
0.9 μM; Figure 3G and Table 1) and T-47D cells (IC50 = 2.7 μM; Figure 3G and Table 1).
To determine the mechanism by which PL inhibits ligand-induced and constitutive
phosphorylation of Stat3, we tested PL for its ability to inhibit Stat3 binding to its
phosphopeptide ligand in a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based binding assay 27. PL
potently inhibited Stat3 binding to its pY-peptide ligand with an IC50 = 1.5 μM (Figure 4,
Table 1) which, using the Cheng-Prussoff equation, converts to a Ki of 68 nM.

Piperlongumine alters expression of multiple Stat3-regulated genes important for
oncogenesis
To assess if the effects of PL on Stat3 extend to modulation of Stat3-regulated genes, we
examined mRNA levels of 51 known Stat3-regulated gene targets (Supplemental Tables 2
and 3) by real time PCR in MDA-MB-468 cells treated with PL (30 μM, 6–8 hours). PL
significantly down-regulated genes encoding cell cycle and apoptosis resistance proteins,
mitochondrial proteins, and oxidative stress defense proteins (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3).
Out of the 46 genes that had detectable mRNA (threshold cycle < 30), 21 (46%) genes had

significantly altered expression (6 hrs) groups. Notably, PL affected 6/9 (67%), apoptosisrelated genes, including the anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2, BcL-xL, Survivin, XIAP, and CIAP.
Treatment for 8 hrs increased the number of Stat3 gene targets affected by PL to 28/46
(61%) and increased the degree of PL-induced changes (Bcl-2 from 15% to 20%; Survivin/
XIAP from 30% to 40%; CIAP/BcL-xL from 50–60% to 70%). Conversely, PUMA, a proapoptotic, BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family shown to be upregulated by p53, was
highly upregulated by PL both at 6h (~4 fold, p < 0.005, Supplemental Table 2) as well as
8h (~5 fold, p < 0.01); this result may have been anticipated as previous reports showed that
Stat3 antagonizes the transcriptional activities of p53 31. Thus, the inhibitory effect of PL on
Stat3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation was accompanied by dramatic modulation
in Stat3-regulated gene expression in breast cancer cells.

Piperlongumine inhibits anchorage-independent and anchorage-dependent growth of
breast cancer cell lines and results in cell apoptosis
Previous reports indicated that breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and
Hs578) depend on Stat3 for growth and/or survival 15, 32. To determine the effect of PL on
their growth, cells were incubated without or with PL for 24–48hr and assessed for
anchorage- independent and anchorage-dependent growth (Figure 5). The ability of
epithelial cancer cells to grow under anchorage-independent conditions (i.e. in ultra-low
attachment plates) is indicative of multiple tumorigenic properties e.g. survival, growth,
anoikis resistance and hence closely approximates their tumor forming ability 33. PL
potently inhibited both anchorage-independent (Figure 5A and B; Table 1) and anchoragedependent growth (Figure 5C; Table 1) of MDA-MB-231 cells (IC50 = 1.2 and 3.4 μM,
respectively), of MDA-MB-468 cells (IC50 = 4.6 and 4.2 μM, respectively) and of Hs 578T
cells (IC50 = 0.2 and 3.0 μM, respectively).

Author Manuscript

To assess if PL induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-468 cells were incubated
with PL (30μM) and sampled over time (15 min to 24 hrs) for measurement of cleaved
caspase 3 (Figure 5D). Caspase 3 cleavage was first noted at 12 hrs, increasing ~12-fold
compared to earlier time points, indicating that PL induces breast cancer cells to undergo
apoptosis in a time-dependent manner.
Piperlongumine blocks mammosphere forming capacity of breast cancer cells isolated
from patient-derived human breast cancer xenografts

Author Manuscript

Previous reports demonstrated that Stat3 was activated within a subpopulation of breast
cancer cells that have tumor-initiating characteristics, so called tumor-initiating cells
(TIC) 15, including TIC described within breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX)
established from biopsies of patients and passaged in SCID/Beige mice 16, 34, 35. To
examine the effect of PL on breast cancer PDX, we first determined pStat3-levels in 28 of
them (Figure 6A). Levels of pStat3 in most PDX were higher than in T47D and MCF-7
tumor xenografts, which were generated in SCID/Beige mice from pStat3-low breast cancer
cell lines. We examined whether PL inhibited the ability of single cell suspensions of two of
these PDX, MC1 36 and BCM-2665, to form mammospheres, a well-described feature of
TIC 15. PL inhibited mammosphere formation by both MC1 and BCM-2665 (IC50 = 4.2 and

0.1 μM respectively; Figure 6C and D; Table 1) suggesting it is capable of inhibiting Stat3
within breast cancer TIC.
The ability of PL to inhibit Stat3 is linked to its ability to inhibit breast cancer cell growth

Author Manuscript

To examine the link between the specific anti-Stat3 activity of PL and its breast cancer cell
growth inhibitory capabilities, we used two different model systems that demonstrate
increased cancer cell functions as a direct consequence of increased Stat3 activity or
expression. In the first one, we used a lentiviral reporter system (Wei et al, data
communicated elsewhere) for detecting cells with high Stat3 activity. This system included
the Stat3-GFP reporter (GFP under the control of four repeats of the M67 sequences, a high
affinity variant of the Stat3 binding sequence from human c-fos promoter). The breast
cancer cell line, SUM159PT was positive for reporter activity (reporter positivity defined by
higher GFP intensity in Stat3-GFP transduced cells compared to TATA-GFP transduced
cells), which matched with our findings regarding its pStat3 status (Figure 3A). SUM159PT
cells transduced with the Stat3-GFP reporter were injected into pre-cleared mouse mammary
gland of immunocompromised SCID/Beige mouse. Stat3-GFP infected Sum159 xenograftsderived cells with differential expression pattern of GFP were then FACS sorted into GFP+
and GFP− populations. The GFP+ cells (indicating high Stat3 transcriptional activity)
formed mammospheres but the GFP− cells did not (Figure 7A). In presence of PL (3 and 10
μM) mammosphere formation by GFP+ cells was completely inhibited. Furthermore,
treatment with PL decreased the pStat3 levels in the GFP+ cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig 7B). Thus, PL inhibited endogenous Stat3-reporter activity and mammosphere growth
by Stat3-active Sum159PT cells indicating a direct link between PL’s Stat3-inhibitory
activity and its ability to inhibit breast cancer cell line growth.

Our second model consisted of Stat3−/− MEF cells stably expressing GFP-Stat3α (Figure
7C), used in Figure 1 27, 37. Hedvat et al, using a similar YFP-tagged Stat3α stable
transfectant of the original Stat3-null transformed MEF, showed that these YFP-Stat3 cells
could form xenogenic tumor grafts after injection into mice whereas the Stat3−/− MEF cells
could not form tumor grafts under identical conditions 38. As shown in Figure 7D, the
Stat3α-GFP MEF cells formed much spheroid colonies under conditions of anchorage
independence. PL inhibited the growth of these mammospheres (Figure 7E, F, IC50: 1.4
μM) with 3μM of PL completely abrogating spheroid colony formation by these cells. We
also assessed the growth of Stat3α-GFP MEF cells and the inhibitory effect of PL using
MTT assays, which also demonstrated increased growth of Stat3α-GFP MEF cells and the
ability of PL to suppress their growth (Figure G, IC50=2.1 μM). Since this increased cell
growth resulted from Stat3 expression, the ability of PL to suppress this growth directly
supports the conclusion that PL suppressed Stat3-mediated oncogenic properties of these
cells.
Piperlongumine treatment inhibits the growth of human breast cancer cell line xenografts
by reducing levels of both pStat3 and Stat3-upregulated gene transcripts within tumors
To test the ability of PL to inhibit growth of human breast cancer tumors in mice, PL (15
mg/Kg body weight/day) or DMSO (vehicle) was administered for three weeks by IP
injection into nude mice bearing human breast cell line (MDA-MB-468) tumor xenografts

starting when the average tumor size in each group was ~100 mm3. Tumor measurements
were taken thrice weekly. PL inhibited tumor growth (Figure 8A) with the difference in
tumor volume between PL- vs. vehicle-treated mice becoming significant after only two
doses and continuing until the end of treatment. The mice were euthanized one day after the
last treatment; tumors were excised and weighed. PL treatment over 21 days reduced tumor
weight by >50% (Figure 8B; p < 0.05). Whole protein extracts of tumor tissue from DMSOtreated mice (n = 12) and PL-treated mice (n = 11) were examined for pStat3, tStat3 and
GAPDH levels using Luminex assays. Levels of pStat3 were reduced by 40% in tumors
from PL treated mice (0.09 ± 0.05) compared to tumors from vehicle treated mice (0.15 ±
0.04; p<0.01; Figure 8C).

Author Manuscript

We demonstrated above that the inhibitory effect of PL on Stat3 phosphorylation and
nuclear translocation in cell lines was accompanied by dramatic reductions in mRNA
transcripts of known Stat3-upregulated genes within breast cancer cell lines in vitro,
including BcL-xL, Survivin, XIAP, CIAP, MT2A, NFE2L1 and Glut1. To determine the
effects of PL treatment on their levels within tumors, we measured mRNA transcript levels
of these genes in tumors from PL-treated mice and vehicle-treated mice by Q-RT-PCR.
Transcript levels of each of these Stat3 upregulated gene targets were reduced up to 63% in
tumors from PL-treated mice (N = 10) vs. tumors from vehicle-treated mice (N = 9;
p<0.001, Supplemental Table 4). In particular, PL treatment reduced the β-actin-normalized
levels of BcL-xL by 52.5% and of Survivin by 45% compared to vehicle-treated mice
(p<0.05; Figure 8D). Thus, PL prevented growth of a Stat3-dependent breast cancer cell line
xenografts, by reducing levels of pStat3 within the tumor and by down-modulating Stat3regulated genes important for tumor growth.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Several strategies have been employed to identify agents that target Stat3 to treat cancer but
none has yet entered into clinical use. Using a high-throughput fluorescence microscopy
search strategy to identify drug-like compounds in a drug-repositioning library (Prestwick
library) that were capable of blocking ligand-induced nuclear translocation of Stat3, we
identified piperlongumine (PL), a natural product isolated from the fruit of the pepper Piper
longum. Piperlongumine inhibited Stat3 binding to its pY-peptide ligand resulting in
reduced nuclear translocation, inhibition of ligand-induced and constitutive Stat3
phosphorylation, and modulation of expression of multiple Stat3-regulated genes. PL
inhibited anchorage-independent and anchorage-dependent breast cancer cell growth and
induced apoptosis of these cells. PL treatment prevented growth of breast cancer cell line
xenografts in nude mice through effectively targeting Stat3 within these tumors resulting in
reduced levels of Stat3-regulated, tumor-survival genes. Thus, PL represents a promising
new agent for hit-to-lead development and subsequent entry into the clinic for use in treating
breast cancer, as well as other cancers in which Stat3 plays a role.
Evidence that PL mediates breast cancer cell apoptosis through Stat3-dependent modulation
of key anti- and pro-apoptotic molecules clearly emerges from our results. PL treatment of
the Stat3-dependent breast cancer cell line, MD-MB-468, for 6–8 hr decreased mRNA levels
of five major anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, BcL-xL, Survivin, XIAP and CIAP) by 20% to

68% (Supplemental Table 2), while increasing mRNA levels of PUMA, a pro-apoptotic
Bcl-2 member, by 5 fold, and FAS (CD95), the death domain containing receptor, by two
fold. These mRNA changes at 6–8 hr were followed at 12 hr by activation of Caspase3
indicating induction of apoptosis. PL also inhibited growth of MDA-MB-468 xenografts in
nude mice, through efficient in vivo reduction of pStat3 levels accompanied by reduction in
8 of 8 Stat3-regulated, anti-apoptosis genes examined including BcL-xL and Survivin (each
by ~50%, p<0.05). While not specifically examined, it is likely that PL targets Stat3 in cell
types within tumors, such as tumor epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts, and endothelial cells,
in addition to the breast cancer cells themselves. Tumor epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts,
and endothelial cells have been reported to contribute to oncogenic transformation and
maintenance, in part, through a Stat3-dependent mechanism 39, thus, targeting Stat3 within
them would be expected to augment the anti-tumor effects of PL.

A phosphoprotein antibody array analysis revealed that PL treatment (30uM for 2hrs) does
not affect Stat3 activation indirectly through targeting other components of signaling
pathway in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468. Using a >1.4 fold change (increase or
decrease; p<0.01, t test) and minimum basal level of expression >40 as cut-off for
designating a measurable change (Supplemental Table 5), we found that PL does not change
phosphorylation of RTKs and non-RTKs known to be involved in Stat3 phosphorylation
including Abl, Brk, EGFR, Her2, IGF1R, Lyn, Met and Src (implicated in Stat3 activation
in breast cancer) and other known upstream kinases including Scr family kinases Lck, Hck,
and Fyn. Neither does it affect other known positive regulators of Stat3 in breast and other
cancers and cell-types e.g. integrin β3, integrin β4, ER-α, progesterone receptor. In addition,
PL did not affect known inhibitors of Stat3 activation such as BTK, Gab1, SHP-1, SHP-2,
GRB2 and WWOX (Supplemental Table 5). Thus, the mechanism of Stat3 inactivation by
PL appears to be its ability to directly inhibit Stat3 binding to its pY-peptide ligand (Figure
4).
Using the same criteria as above to designate what constitutes a measurable change in
phosphorylation, the phospho-proteome screen also revealed that PL did not significantly
affect levels of various components of other major pro-oncogenic signaling pathways, e.g.
AP1, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, FAK, and MAP kinase (ERK, JNK, and p38) pathway
(Supplemental Table 6). There was, however, a significant decrease (by ~30–40%) in the
absolute levels of p65, a major subunit of the NF-κB protein complex (Supplemental Table
6). However, p65 (RelA) has two potential Stat3 binding sites in its promoter (data not
shown) suggesting that the PL-mediated decrease in p65 may be mediated indirectly through
its effect on Stat3.

Author Manuscript

While we established that PL specifically targets breast cancer cell lines with increased
pStat3 levels, PL was recently shown to inhibit the growth of two breast cancer cell lines
with low levels of pStat3, BT-474 and MCF-7 40. Recently, unphosphorylated (U)-Stat3,
which represents the bulk of total Stat3, has been described to be oncogenic 41, 42, in part, by
modulating known pStat3 gene targets with pro-oncogenic effects including c-Myc, c-fos
and Bcl-xL, as well as genes such as RANTES, cdc2, cyclin B1, IL-6, IL-8, Met and MRAS through its co-operative binding with NF-κB to specific κB elements and/or other
novel mechanisms 41, 43, 44. These observations raised the possibility that PL was targeting

not only pStat3 but U-Stat3, as well. To address this possibility, we measured levels of
constitutive pStat3 levels (Figure 3A) as well as total Stat3, as a surrogate of U-Stat3 (Figure
3B) in eleven breast cancer cell lines and two non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell lines,
MCF-10A and MCF-12A. The two normal breast cell lines, as well as 6 breast cancer cell
lines (MCF-7, T47D, ZR-75-1, BT-474, MDA-MB-453 and SK-BR3) had low pStat3 levels,
whereas 5 cell lines (Hs578T, HCC1954, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and Sum159PT)
had increased levels of pStat3 (Figure 3A). Interestingly, examining the total Stat3 levels in
these cells revealed that the non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells, MCF-10A and
MCF-12A, had substantially lower levels of total Stat3 compared to the breast cancer cell
lines. Irrespective of their differential levels of constitutive pStat3, all the cancer lines had
from 10-to- 25 times the level of total Stat3 compared to these cells. Importantly two pStat3low cell lines, T47D and ZR-75-1, had the highest levels of total Stat3. We examined six
pStat3-low cell lines MCF-7, T47D, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-453, MCF-10A and MCF-12A—
along with three pStat3-high cell lines—MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and Sum159PT—
for PL-sensitivity in anchorage-independent growth assays, which clearly revealed (Table 2)
that all the pStat3-high cells were effectively inhibited within 16 hours with IC50s ranged
from 2.8 to 12.9 μM. In contrast, the pStat3-low cells e.g. the MCF10A, MCF12A, MDAMB-453, ZR-75-1 and T-47D had higher IC50s (ranging from 15.5 to 100 μM). Importantly,
however, the results of incubation of cells lines with PL for a longer time period (80 hr)
revealed that there is a significant negative correlation between PL IC50 values and the total
Stat3 levels in these cell lines (Pearson r = −0.7739, p = 0.0144), indicating that with longer
incubation, PL sensitivity correlates to levels of total or U-Stat3. Thus, it appears that PL not
only is able to reduce levels of constitutive and ligand-induced pStat3 within breast cancer
cells, it also is able to target U-Stat3; the mechanism for PL targeting of U-Stat3 is an area
of active investigation in our laboratory.

PL was shown previously to induce apoptosis of leukemia cell lines 45 but its mechanism of
action was not explored. More recently, PL was identified in a high-throughput screen
designed to identify compounds that activate p53 40. Detailed analysis demonstrated that PL
selectively induced apoptosis in various cancer cells, including breast cancer, by decreasing
their defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS)40. PL was shown to bind to glutathione
S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) and carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) and to inhibit GSTP1 activity;
however the IC50 for GSTP1 inhibition was modest (~100 μM) while the IC50 for CBR1 not
reported. The high IC50 reported and the inability of over-expression of GSTP1 and CBR1
to fully rescue a PL-susceptible cancer cell from PL-induced apoptosis strongly suggests
that apoptosis induction by PL is mediated, at least in part, by affecting other targets. Our
findings clearly support Stat3 as another key PL target and that PL induces cancer cell
apoptosis through modulating the balance of anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins within cancer
cells by inhibiting Stat3.
Stat3 has previously been demonstrated to be a major regulator of cellular defense against
ROS, which raises the distinct possibility that some of the effects of PL on ROS defense
reported above 40, 46 may be mediated through Stat3 inhibition. When mice engineered to
have tissue-specific Stat3 deletions were subjected to injury models, they displayed
increased ROS production and injury within their cardiomyocytes, astrocytes, and
osteoblast/osteocytes compared to WT mice 47–51. In these and other experiments, Stat3 was

shown to upregulate expression of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) 52, the metallothioneins
MT1 and MT2 53 and to modulate a variety of other oxidative stress and defense genes.
Specifically, MT2, IDH2, OPLAH, PRDX6, SOD3, GPX4, GSR, PRDX5, NFE2L1,
MAPK10, BACE2, PRDX5, PARK7 and NDUFS4 were shown to be upregulated by
Stat3 49 while GSS, GGTLA1, GPX7, ANPEP, GSTA3, Ptges, NQO1 and Ptgis were
downregulated by Stat3 49. To determine if PL modulated mRNA transcript levels of ROS
defense genes through its inhibitory effect on Stat3, we used a commercially obtained panel
of Q-RT-PCR primers for 84 genes involved in ROS metabolism (PAHS 065A, SA
Biosciences), which included many genes reported to be Stat3 regulated (Supplemental
Table 3). Primers for the remaining 13 Stat3-regulated ROS metabolism genes, which were
not included in this panel, were synthesized. Levels of mRNA transcript for these 97
(84+13) genes were determined in total RNA isolated from MDA-MB-468 cells incubated
without or with PL (30μM PL for 6–8hr); 77 out of 97 genes had detectable levels for
analysis. Out of these 77 genes, 19 genes (25%) were affected by PL treatment at 6hrs (≥
20% change, p<0.05) and 34 (44%) were affected at 8hrs (≥ 20% change, p<0.05). Out of 14
anti-oxidant genes, previously shown to be upregulated by Stat3 (Supplemental Table 3), PL
treatment for 8 hrs significantly downregulated 8 genes (MT2A, IDH2, NFE2L1, GSR,
BACE2, NDUFS4, PARK7 and FOXM1). Out of the 8 genes, reported to be negatively
regulated by Stat3 (Supplemental Table 3), 4 genes (NOS2, GSS, NQO1, and GGT5) were
upregulated by PL treatment for 8 hr. In addition to known Stat3-regulated genes, PL
significantly downregulated 6 additional transcripts encoding proteins with known antioxidant properties (MTL5, SCARA3, PXDN, GPX3, RNF7 and SELS (Supplemental Table
7). These genes could also be additional targets positively regulated by Stat3. In fact, Scara3
appears to be positively regulated by a constitutively active Stat3 mutant (Stat3-C)
expression in 3T3 cells 54. HSP60, a Stat3-regulated gene 55, positively regulates GPX3
during human adipose tissue-derived stem cell (hATSC) differentiation 56. Thus, apart from
PL’s role in directly binding to GSTP1 40, we provide convincing evidence of an additional
mechanism of its ROS-modulatory action through its targeting of Stat3 and modulation of
the Stat3-mediated anti-oxidant transcriptome.

The lentiviral Stat3 reporter system and selection of GFP+ Sum159 xenograft derived cells

Author Manuscript

A lentiviral reporter system for detecting cells with high Stat3 activity was developed in our
collaborator’s lab (Wei et al, to be presented elsewhere). This included the STAT3-GFP
reporter (GFP under the control of four repeats of the M67 sequences, a high affinity variant
of the STAT3 binding sequence from human c-fos promoter), the TATA-GFP negative
control (constructed by deleting the M67 sequences to leave the TATA box only), and an
EFS-GFP positive control (constructed by replacing the four M67 sequences with the
elongation factor 1 alpha binding sequence or EFS). The reporter system proved to be both
stringent and sensitive to STAT3 signaling.
Human breast cancer cell line xenograft assay

Author Manuscript

MDA-MB-468 cells were subcutaneously inoculated into right flank of 5–6 week old nude
mice (15 mice/group). After ~4 weeks, mice were randomized (average tumor size
~100mm3/group) and received either PL (15 mg/Kg in 50 μl DMSO) or DMSO (50 μl)
intraperitonealy 5 days/week for 3 weeks. Tumor sizes were measured thrice weekly.
Subcutaneous tumor volume (mm3) was calculated as 0.5 × (long dimension) × (short
dimension)2. At the end of 3 weeks, mice were euthanized. Tumor tissue was excised,
weighed and protein extracted for measurement of pStat3, tStat3, and GAPDH by Luminex
assay. SUM159PT cells transduced with the Stat3-GFP reporter were injected into the precleared mammary gland of immunocompromised SCID/Beige mouse, the same strain used
for PDXs.
