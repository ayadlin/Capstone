ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with poor
prognosis. Here, we studied the effects of phenformin, a mitochondrial complex I
inhibitor and more potent chemical analog of the diabetes drug metformin on the
inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis of glioma stem cells (GSCs) using
both in vitro and in vivo models. Phenformin inhibited the self-renewal of GSCs,
decreased the expression of stemness and mesenchymal markers and increased
the expression of miR-124, 137 and let-7. Silencing of let-7 abrogated phenformin
effects on the self-renewal of GSCs via a pathway associated with inhibition of H19
and HMGA2 expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that phenformin inhibited tumor
growth and prolonged the overall survival of mice orthotopically transplanted with
GSCs. Combined treatments of phenformin and temozolomide exerted an increased
antitumor effect on GSCs in vitro and in vivo. In addition, dichloroacetate, an inhibitor
of the glycolysis enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, that decreases lactic
acidosis induced by biguanides, enhanced phenformin effects on the induction of
cell death in GSCs and prolonged the survival of xenograft-bearing mice. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that phenformin targets GSCs and can be efficiently
combined with current therapies for GBM treatment and GSC eradication.

INTRODUCTION

[3, 4]. Therefore, identifying therapeutic approaches to
selectively target GSCs is of great importance for the
treatment of GBM and for improving patient prognosis.
Metformin is a biguanide drug that has been used
clinically for the treatment of type II diabetes for decades.
Epidemiological studies have suggested an anti-cancer
impact of metformin in diabetic patients [5]. Additional
studies have shown that metformin can inhibit cancer cell
proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest in multiple cancer
types, including glioma [6–10]. Importantly, metformin
inhibits the growth of cancer stem cells (including GSCs),
induces tumor regression and prolongs tumor remission
in xenograft models [8, 11]. These findings suggest
that metformin could be a promising drug alone and in
combination with other treatments to target GSCs.
Phenformin, an analog of metformin, exhibits a
greater anti-tumor activity [12] and potency in leukemia,

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and
aggressive astrocytic tumor and is characterized by
increased proliferation, invasion into the surrounding
normal tissue, robust angiogenesis and resistance to
conventional therapies [1]. The prognosis for patients
with GBM remains extremely poor and has not changed
significantly during the last decades. GBM contain a small
subpopulation of cancer stem cells (glioma stem cells,
GSCs) [2] that are characterized by the ability to selfrenew, exhibit multi-lineage differentiation potential and
to generate xenografts that recapitulate the parental tumors
[3]. Furthermore, GSCs are resistant to conventional
therapies as compared with differentiated tumor cells,
and therefore remain at the tumor site following
resection, which eventually leads to tumor recurrence

lung, breast, colon, melanoma and prostate cancers
[13–16]; however, no studies regarding the effect of
phenformin on GBM and GSCs have been reported.
The primary target of biguanides in the cells is the
mitochondria, where these drugs transiently inhibit
complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain,
which results in decreased ATP production and increased
AMP levels [17]. These processes in turn activate 5′-AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor and
a master coordinator of integrated signaling networks
consisting of metabolic and growth pathways [5]. AMPK
activation following biguanide-induced metabolic stress
has been shown to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 1 (mTORC1) leading to reduced growth in
tumor cells [18–20]. In addition to the known effects of
metformin and phenformin on cell metabolic pathways,
there are additional processes that are implicated in their
antitumor effects such as inhibition of the NF-κB and
STAT3 pathways [21–24]. Metformin also targets cancer
cells via modulation of small noncoding RNAs (miRNAs)
that inhibit gene expression at the posttranslational level.
Several miRNAs, such as miR-33a, miR-26a, miR-193,
miR-221/222 and let-7, are regulated by metformin in
breast, pancreatic, and lung cancer cells [25–29]. In
contrast, no studies on the regulation of miRNAs by
phenformin were reported so far.
Here, we studied the effects of phenformin
on GSC stemness and apoptosis and analyzed the
molecular mechanisms involved in its effects. In
addition, we analyzed the effects of phenformin alone
and in combination with temozolomide (TMZ) and
dichloroacetate (DCA) on GSCs in vitro and on the growth
of GSC-derived xenografts and animal survival.

the GSCs (Figure 1A). In addition, phenformin also
inhibited the frequency of sphere formation (Figure 1B)
and the self-renewal of these cells (Figure 1C). Doseresponse analysis indicated that the inhibitory effect
of phenformin on the self-renewal of the cells was
observed already at a concentration of 50 µM, whereas
the inhibitory effects of metformin were first observed at
a concentration of 10 mM (Figure 1C). In addition, GSCs
were more sensitive to phenformin treatment even though
phenformin concentration was already 400-fold lower
than that of metformin (comparison of the self-renewal
level is indicated by the green arrows in Figure 1C).
Similar results were obtained with additional GSCs
(Supplementary Figure S1A). Moreover, the average
sphere size of the phenformin-treated GSCs was much
smaller than that of untreated spheroids or those treated
with metformin (Figures 1D and Supplementary S1B).
To further confirm that phenformin can affect GSC
stemness, we analyzed the expression of the stemness
markers OCT4, SOX2 and CD44 in the treated cells and
found that phenformin (100 µM) inhibited the expression of
these markers (Figure s1E, 1F, Supplementary Figure S1C–
S1E), whereas it increased the expression of the neural
markers, GFAP and MAP2 (Figures 1G and Supplementary
Figure S1C). In addition, we found that phenformin
decreased the expression of YKL40 and fibronectin, which
are associated with the mesenchymal transformation of
GSCs (Figure 1E and Figure S1C). Similar effects on
stemness markers were obtained with metformin, however,
these effects were observed only at a concentration of
20 mM (Supplementary Figure S1D and S1E).
Phenformin at concentrations up to 500 µM did not
induce significant GSC death (Figures 1H–1I), but cell
apoptosis was induced by phenformin at concentrations
higher than 1.0 mM already after 24 hr of treatment as
documented by the increases in cleaved caspase 3 and
PARP expression (Figure 1H) and using the live/dead assay
(Figures 1I, 1J). In contrast, metformin induced only a small
degree of cell death after 24 hours at a concentration of 40
mM that was observed using the live/dead assay (Figure 1I)
but not by analyzing cleaved caspase-3 (Figure 1H). In
addition, we also found that the effect of phenformin on
GSCs was much more potent than its effect on glioma cell
lines (Supplementary Figures S1F, S1G). Phenformin barely
induced caspase-3 and PARP cleavage in differentiated
glioma cells when its concentration was 1 mM.

RESULTS
Phenformin inhibits GSC self-renewal and
stemness
Cancer stem cells are resistant to chemotherapy and
radiation therapy and are implicated in tumor infiltration
and recurrence. Previous studies suggested that metformin
selectively targeted cancer stem cell growth in breast, lung,
melanoma and glioma tumors [8, 10, 30–35]. However,
the effects of phenformin on GSCs are not yet described.
To examine whether phenformin can target GSCs, we
employed neurosphere cultures that were generated from
three individual GBM primary tumors. The GSCs were
maintained as spheroids in serum-free medium containing
FGF and EGF and their self-renewal, differentiation and
tumorigenic abilities were validated as previously reported
[36–40]. We examined the effects of phenformin on the
self-renewal and stemness of these cells and included
metformin for comparison in some of these studies. We
found that treatment of the HF2414 GSCs with phenformin
(100 µM) significantly decreased the proliferation of

Phenformin regulates the expression of noncoding RNAs and inhibits the self-renewal of
GSCs via the H19/let-7/HMGA2 pathway
Metformin has been reported to exert its anticancer effects via miRNAs that are associated with energy
metabolic pathways or with stemness and cell cycle
regulation [41] by the induction of DICER expression
[27] . However, there are no reports on miRNA regulation

by phenformin. Using qPCR analysis, we found that the
expression of miR-124, 137 and let-7 was significantly
increased following phenformin treatment (Figure 2A),
whereas metformin induced a significant increase only of
let-7 and miR-137 expression (Supplementary Figure S2).
These data demonstrate that different miRNAs may be
involved in the effects of phenformin and metformin on
GSCs. In contrast, phenformin did not induce any significant
changes in the expression of miR-34, miR-125b, miR-197,
miR-372, miR-140 and miR-210 (data not shown).
Using specific antagomiRs we demonstrated that
inhibition of miR-124 and let-7 expression decreased
some of the inhibitory effect of phenformin on GSC selfrenewal, whereas inhibition of miR-137 expression did not
have a significant effect (Figure 2B).
Let-7 acts as a tumor suppressor miRNA and
has been reported to modulate CSC self-renewal and
mesenchymal transformation by targeting HMGA2 [42].
Since phenformin inhibited both the stemness and
mesenchymal markers of GSCs, we further examined
the effect of phenformin on HMGA2 expression and the
role of let-7 in its effect. Using TCGA data analysis, we
demonstrated that the expression of HMGA2 was increased
in the mesenchymal GBM compared to the G-CIMP
subtype that exhibits a better prognosis (Figure 2C),
whereas the expression of let-7 exhibited an opposite
pattern of expression (Figure 2D). Treatment of GSCs
with phenformin or overexpression of let-7 induced a
significant downregulation of HMGA2 mRNA levels
and phenformin treatment of these cells did not result in
additional decrease in HMGA2 expression (Figure 2E).
Transfection of the cells with a let-7 antagomiR increased
the expression of HMGA2 in the cells and abrogated
the inhibitory effect of phenformin on the expression
of HMGA2 (Figure 2F). We further demonstrated that
transduction of GSCs with a lentivirus vector expressing
HMGA2 which lacks 3′-UTR (a let-7 “resistant”
HMGA2), decreased the inhibitory effect of phenformin
on cell renewal of the GSCs (Figure 2G), suggesting that
the targeting of HMGA2 by let-7 mediated at least some
of phenformin effects.
Another pathway that affects the activity of let-7
is its bioavailablity and sequestration by binding to H19
[43, 44]. We therefore examined the effect of phenformin
on H19 expression in GSCs. As presented in Figure 3A,
treatment of the HF2355 and HF2587 with phenformin
decreased the expression of H19 in these cells. We then
examined the role of H19 in the stemness characteristics
of the GSCs and found that silencing of H19 (Figure 3B)
decreased both the self-renewal (Figure 3C) and stem cell
markers of these cells (Figure 3D). In addition, silencing
of H19 decreased also the expression of HMGA2 (Figure
3E, 3F) and increased the inhibitory effect of let-7 on the
HMGA2 as measured using the HMGA2 3′-UTR tagged
to luciferase (Figure 3G). Collectively, these results

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

suggest that phenformin regulates both the expression and
bioavailability of let-7 by upregulating its expression and
downregulating H19 that acts as let-7 sponge.
In addition to the let-7 pathway, we also found that
silencing of miR-124 abrogated some of phenformin
effects on the expression of differentiation, stemness
and mesenchymal markers (Figure 3H, 3I). These results
are summarized in a diagram that depicts the effects of
phenformin on the stemness of GSCs via the H19/let-7/
HMGA2 [45] and the miR-124 pathway (Figure 3J).

Phenformin inhibits the growth of GSC-derived
xenograft and prolongs mouse survival
To analyze the effects of phenformin on GBM
tumor growth and animal survival, we treated mice
harboring GSC-derived xenografts with phenformin
and analyzed tumor growth using in vivo imaging and
immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. We administered
phenformin (1 mg/ml) to the mice in 5% glucose drinking
water for 4 weeks and tumor growth was monitored
weekly using in vivo luciferase imaging. Phenformin
decreased tumor growth significantly as analyzed by
in vivo imaging (Figure 4A) and after 4 weeks of treatment,
the average tumor size of the phenformin-treated
xenografts was about one third of the control untreated
tumors (Figure 4B). Similar results were obtained
when phenformin (50 mg/kg/day) was administered by
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (Supplementary Figure
S3A, S3B). These results were further validated using
H&E staining (Figure 4C). In addition to its effects on
tumor growth, phenformin whether administered either by
drinking water, i.p. injection (data not shown) or gavage
significantly prolonged the survival of the xenograftbearing mice (Figure 4D, Supplementary Figure S3C).
To further study the mechanisms of phenformin effects
in vivo, we analyzed the expression of CD31 and cleaved
caspase-3 in tumor sections of control and phenformintreated mice. Immunohistochemical staining showed
that phenformin treatment significantly reduced CD31
expression and increased cleaved caspase-3 expression in
GSC-derived xenografts (Figure 4E). The quantification
of CD31 and cleaved caspase-3 expression is shown in
Figure 4F. These results suggest that the therapeutic effect
of phenformin in mice bearing GSC-derived xenografts is
associated with the inhibition of angiogenesis and induction
of tumor cell apoptosis. Therefore, the in vivo studies further
demonstrate that phenformin has a promising potential
therapeutic effect in the treatment of GBM.
The effects of phenformin on mouse survival
were more pronounced than metformin’s effects despite
the fact that metformin concentrations were four fold
higher (Supplementary Figure S3D). These results
are in accordance with the in vitro results described in
Supplementary Figure S1A.

Phenformin enhances the inhibitory effect of
TMZ on GSC growth in vitro and in vivo

and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. In this study,
we explored the effects of phenformin on the proliferation,
apoptosis and stemness of GSCs. Most anticancer drugs
employed currently inhibit mainly tumor cell proliferation
and induce cell death, but have limited efficacy in
targeting cancer stem cells. Our study shows that
phenformin attenuates the self-renewal and stemness of
GSCs and induces cell death when administered at higher
concentrations. Within a very low concentration range
that is 400-fold lower than that of metformin, phenformin
inhibits GSC self-renewal and stemness-related proteins.
Moreover, GSCs appear to be much more sensitive than
glioma cells to the effect of phenformin, further indicating
that it can efficiently target GSCs.
One of the barriers to successful treatment of GBM
is the eradication of the GSC subpopulation. Despite
the fact, that GSCs represent only a small percentage
of the tumor cells in GBM, they are resistant to current
therapeutic modalities and implicated in tumor recurrence.
The potent antitumor effect of phenformin on GSCs
demonstrated in this study highlights the potential of
this drug as a novel and potent therapeutic agent for the
treatment of GBM.
Metformin has been reported to exert its anti-cancer
effects through miRNA modulation via the induction
of DICER expression [29]. The miRNAs induced by
metformin are associated mainly with energy metabolism
pathways; however, additional miRNAs involved in
stemness and cell cycle regulation have been also
reported to be modulated by this drug [41]. We found that
phenformin induced the upregulation of miR-124, miR-137
and let-7 in the GSCs and that let-7 and miR-124
played a role in the inhibitory effect of phenformin on
the self-renewal of these cells. Moreover, we found that
the effect of phenformin on GSCs was mediated by the
downregulation of HMGA2 via the targeting of this gene
by let-7. HMGA2 acts as an oncogene in a large number
of tumors and has been reported to be a direct target of
let-7 [48]. Recently, HMGA2 has been also reported to
mediate the inhibitory effect of let-7 on cancer stem cells
in anaplastic astrocytoma [49, 50].
In addition to the upregulation of let-7 expression,
we found that phenformin also increased the
bioavailability of let-7 by inhibiting the expression of
H19 that acts as a let-7 sponge [43]. Indeed, recent studies
demonstrated that H19 acts as an oncogenic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) [51, 52] that contains binding sites
for let-7 miRNA family and modulate let-7 bioavailability
[43, 53]. Our data demonstrate that silencing of H19
decreased the stemness of GSCs and enhanced the ability
of let-7 to inhibit HMGA2 expression. Thus, we conclude
that phenformin mediates its effects on GSC stemness via
the upregulation of let-7 expression and downregulation
of H19 that further increases let-7 bioavailability and
ability to inhibit HMGA2 expression. The effects of let7 on additional pathways that regulate GSC function and

TMZ is the standard treatment of care for GBM
patients following surgery. We found that the phenformininduced cell death in GSCs was further increased
when combined with TMZ (Figure 5A, Supplementary
Figure S4). The combined effects of metformin and
TMZ on GSC apoptosis were less striking than that of
phenformin, and metformin even at a concentration
of 40 mM exerted a smaller cytotoxic effect in TMZtreated GSCs (Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure S4).
In vivo studies also confirmed the enhanced effects of
phenformin and TMZ on GSC-derived xenografts. Thus,
combined treatment of phenformin and TMZ significantly
reduced tumor growth (Figure 5B) and prolonged overall
survival of xenograft-bearing mice (Figure 5C). Our
results demonstrated that combined treatment with TMZ
enhanced the effect of phenformin and enables the use of
even lower concentrations of this drug.

Combined phenformin and DCA treatment
induces a synergistic effect on GSC death
DCA is a well-established drug that has been used
for the treatment of lactic acidosis, a major side effect that
prompted the withdrawal of phenformin as a treatment for
diabetes. DCA inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
(PDK), which suppresses lactate production and promotes
cellular dependency on mitochondrial respiration [46, 47].
Recent studies demonstrated cytotoxic effects of DCA in
glioma cells and a therapeutic impact in GBM patients [47].
We found that DCA decreased the self-renewal of GSCs in
a dose-dependent manner and that combined treatment of
DCA and phenformin (100 µM) induced a more significant
effect (Figure 6A). Treatment of GSCs with DCA alone up
to a concentration of 10 mM did not induce a significant
degree of GSC death (Supplementary Figure S5,
Figure 6B and 6C). However, a combined treatment
of DCA and phenformin induced a large degree of cell
apoptosis (Figures 6B and 6C, Supplementary Figure S5).
Moreover, a combined treatment of phenformin and DCA
exerted a more significant effect on the overall survival of
mice bearing GSC-derive xenografts (Figure 6D).
A combined treatment of DCA and metformin at
higher concentrations than phenformin, increased GSC
death and inhibited GSC self-renewal to a much lower
level (Figures 6A–6C, and Supplementary Figure S5A). We
also found that treatment of the mice with phenformin or
phenformin and DCA did not change lactate levels in the
serum of the treated mice (Supplementary Figure S5B, S5C).

DISCUSSION
GBM has a dismal prognosis that is partly attributed
to the presence of GSCs that exhibit self-renewal abilities

survival and the role of miR-124 in phenformin effects
are currently being studied. In contrast to phenformin,
metformin did not upregulate the expression of miR-124
in GSCs. Since this miRNA has been reported to inhibit
the self-renewal of GSCs [54] and the activation of STAT3
signaling [55], the differential effect of metformin and
phenformin on miR-124 expression may be associated
with the increased inhibitory effect of phenformin on
GSCs self-renewal and mesenchymal transition.

In addition to its inhibitory effects on GSC stemness
and survival in vitro, phenformin also inhibited the growth
of GSC-derived xenografts. The effects of phenformin on
glioma xenografts in vivo was not yet reported, whereas,
only few studies reported metformin effects on tumor
growth or mouse survival [11, 56, 57]. Recently, Sato
et al. demonstrated that pretreatment of glioma cells
in vitro with metformin resulted in prolonged survival of
xenograft-bearing mice [56]. Another study demonstrated

the inhibitory effect of metformin on GBM tumor growth
in vivo but did not demonstrated an effect of metformin
on the survival of xenograft-bearing mice [58]. In the
current study, we demonstrated that phenformin inhibited
GBM tumor growth and prolonged overall survival of
mice bearing GSC-derived xenografts. We also found that
phenformin treatment exerted an anti-angiogenic effect
as was reflected by the decreased expression of CD31
in the treated tumors and increased cell apoptosis, as
indicated by the increased number of caspase-3 positive
tumor cells. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that

both metformin and phenformin inhibited angiogenesis in
breast cancer and that phenformin was significantly more
potent than metformin [58]. The in vivo apoptotic effect
of phenformin is in accordance with our in vitro results
in GSCs. Altogether, these results further emphasize the
clinical potential of phenformin in GBM therapy.
Although phenformin induced a significant
therapeutic impact on GSC-derived xenografts, it is
unlikely to be employed as a single agent therapy for
the treatment of GBM. Our results demonstrated that

the cytotoxic effects of phenformin and enabled the use
of lower concentrations of this drug, thus increasing its
efficacy and safety. Similarly, the combined treatment
of phenformin with DCA resulted in enhanced cytotoxic
effects that were evident with lower concentrations than
each drug alone. Analyzing the therapeutic effects of the
combined treatments of phenformin with TMZ or DCA
demonstrated that phenformin can synergize with other
GBM treatments that increase its efficacy and safety.
Recent studies indicated that another way to sensitize
tumor cells to phenformin is by decreasing the rate of
glycolysis in these cells [59].
Metformin replaced phenformin for the treatment of
diabetes mainly due to the lactic acidosis side effects of
this drug. This, however, may not apply for the treatment
of GBM for the following reasons. The dose of metformin
for diabetes treatment is approximately 10–20 times higher
than that of phenformin; however, phenformin can induce
glioma cell death in concentrations 80-fold and lower and
attenuate GSC self-renewal in a concentration of at least
200-fold lower than metformin. Moreover, a recent study
demonstrated that treatment of mice with phenformin
(100 mg/kg, o.p) for 6 weeks did not affect plasma insulin or
glucose levels nor did it increase blood lactate levels [15].
Similarly, we also found that treatment of mice bearing
GSC-derived xenografts with phenformin did not increase
blood lactate levels.
DCA has been reported to decrease the effects of
biguanides on lactate production [46] and therefore a
combined treatment of DCA and phenformin is expected
to inhibit lactic acidosis in response to treatment
with phenformin. Our findings demonstrated that the
combined treatment of phenformin and DCA resulted in
synergistic cytotoxic effects that were evident with lower
concentrations of each drug alone. Moreover, a combined
treatment of mice bearing GSC-derived xenografts with
phenformin and DCA induced a more pronounced effect
on the survival of the mice compared to each treatment
alone, suggesting that DCA not only can minimize the
most common side effects of phenformin but also increases
its anti-tumor effects. These results suggest that the risk/
benefit ratio of phenformin treatment of GBM may be
significantly lower than phenformin treatment of diabetes.
Collectively, our results indicate that phenformin
may be a novel potent drug for the treatment of GBM and
for the targeting of GSCs either alone or in combination
with other GBM therapeutics.

All human materials were used in accordance
with the policies of the Institutional Review Board at
Henry Ford Hospital. The generation of GSCs and their
characterization were recently described [37, 39, 60–62].
The GSCs that were used in this study are HF2414, HF2355,
HF2354, HF2359, HF2927 and HF2587. Spheroids were
maintained in neurosphere medium and examined for the
expression of CD44, Bmi-1, CD133, Musashi-1, Sox2 and
nestin, self-renewal, expression of astrocytic and neuronal
markers upon plating on poly-D-ornithine in serumcontaining medium and for their tumorigenic potential in
nude mice as previously reported [36, 61].

Western-blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as described
[36]. Equal loading was verified using an anti-β-actin
antibody.

Real-time quantitative PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using
QIAzol reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. 0.5 μg of RNA was employed to
synthesize cDNA by Thermoscript (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) with oligodT primers. We employed the SYBR green
quantitative PCR method to analyze mRNA expression
levels. For internal control we employed S12 mRNA
levels. Primers for stemness and mesenchymal markers
were previously reported (37.38).
For the expression of miRNAs in the different cells,
total RNA was isolated from the sample of interest using
miReasy total RNA isolation kit from Qiagen that isolates
RNA fraction with sizes < 200 bp. 1mg of total RNA was
processed according to Qiagen miScript System principle
and procedures (miScript II RT kit). miRNAs forward
primers were generated using sequences from miRBase and
were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA).
The reactions were run in triplicates. The relative
expression of the specific miRNAs was calculated using
the comparative (CT) method after normalization to U6
snRNA. Quantitative miRNA or mRNA expression data
were acquired and analyzed using the ABI Prism 7000
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems).
Data were further analyzed by comparative CT (ΔΔCT)
method, and results are expressed in arbitrary units.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Neurosphere formation assay

Materials

The ability of GSCs to form secondary
neurospheres was determined as previously described
[54, 63, 64]. Briefly, disaggregated cells were subjected
to the appropriate treatments, and cells were plated onto
24-well plates at a density of 10 or 100 cells/well through
limiting dilutions. The number of neurospheres per well

Metformin and phenformin were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Anti-CD44, HMGA2,
cleaved caspase-3 and PARP antibodies were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA).
Anti-actin was from Sigma-Aldrich.

wells. Spheres that contained more than 20 cells were
scored. Results are presented as percentages of maximal

right of the bregma at a depth of 2.5 mm and a rate of
5 µl/30 seconds. Mice were treated with phenformin
2 weeks following GSC implantation according to the
following protocols: Experiment 1: Vehicle (5% glucose)
or phenformin (1 mg/ml in 5% glucose water) were
administered in drinking water for 4 weeks. Fresh water
was provided every other day and the amount of water
consumed by the mice was measured daily. Experiment
2: Vehicle (OraPlus) or phenformin (100 mg/kg in
OraPlus) were administered by daily oral gavage for 5
days per week for 3 weeks. Experiment 3: Saline (0.9%),
or phenformin (50 or 100 mg/kg/day) were administered
via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections once daily for 5 days/
week for 2 weeks. As a comparison, metformin (400 mg/
kg/day) was also administrated orally for three weeks. All
animals were monitored daily and sacrificed at the first
signs of neurological deficit. Tumor growth in mice was
monitored using Xenogen imaging system. For combined
treatments, vehicle (OraPlus), phenformin (100 mg/kg in
OraPlus), TMZ (20 mg/kg in OraPlus), DCA (20 mg/kg
in Oraplus), phenformin (100 mg/kg) +TMZ (20 mg/kg),
or phenformin (100 mg/kg) + DCA (20 mg/kg) were
administered by daily oral gavage. Among the treatments
phenformin and DCA were given once a day and 5 days
per week for 3 weeks, and TMZ was given once a day and
5 days/week for 1 week only. The number of mice used
in each experiments are listed in specific figure legends.

In vitro limiting dilution assay
GSCs were plated in 96-well plates in decreasing
numbers per well (50, 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1). Ten days
later the generation and number of neurospheres were
quantified in each well. Extreme limiting dilution analysis
was performed using software available at http://bioinf.
wehi.edu.au/software/elda.

Cell growth and proliferation
GSCs were plated at a concentration of 2000 cells/
well in 96 wells. Cell proliferation was determined
using the ViaLight plus kit (Lonza) according to the
manufacturer’s guidelines.

Gene and non-coding RNA expression in GSCs
Lentivirus vectors expressing let-7, let-7 antagomiR
tagged to GFP (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA)
or HMGA2 lacking the 3′-UTR were packaged and used
to infect glioma cells according to the manufacturer’s
protocol and as previously described [54, 65]. The
transduction efficiency was more than 85% as determined
by GFP expression and RT-PCR validation.
Silencing of H19 was performed using siRNA
oligonucleotides obtained from ABM (Richmond, Canada).

Bioluminescence imaging
For in vivo luciferase assays, D-luciferin (150 mg/kg)
was inoculated i.p. into nude mice to measure the
tumor size. Bioluminescence images were obtained
using the IVIS Spectrum System (Perkin-Elmer Life
Sciences, Waltham, MA). Mice were imagined once a
week since one week after implantation of tumors. The
effect of treatment on the tumor growth was analyzed by
comprising BLI change before and after treatment.

Cell death assays
One day before phenformin or metformin treatment,
1.5− 2.5 × 105 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate. We used
two methods to analyze live/dead cells. The first method
was trypan blue staining of dead cells. The live and dead
cell numbers were determined using a hemocytometer.
Both dead and live cell numbers were counted with a
hemocytometer under microscope. The second method
was the live/dead cell assay (MP03224, Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen). Briefly, calcein AM and EthD-1 were added
to the culture medium for a final concentration of 1 µM
for calcein AM and 2.5 µM for EthD-1. The live/dead cell
number was then analyzed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

TCGA data analysis
Level 2 processed gene expression data from the
public-access clinical data tables were downloaded from
the TCGA for 517 GBM. The per-sample files were
merged on the Agilent probe ID to form a single data table
(SAS v9.2). Expression values were assessed for each
gene of interest (HMGA2, let-7) and averaged across
consistent probes. Expression was averaged within gene
for persons who had more than one tumor sample/aliquot
analyzed. For consistency, the origin of tissue was the
brain, no prior tumor was recorded and the histopathology
was noted to be untreated primary (de novo) GBM.

GSC-derived xenografts
Following the guidelines of Henry Ford Hospital’s
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, dissociated
GSCs (3 × 105 cells) transduced with a lentivirus vector
expressing FLuc were inoculated intracranially into
nude mice (Nu/Nu) as previously described [54].
Briefly, animals were anesthetized and injected with
the primary human GSCs through a 3 mm hole to the
