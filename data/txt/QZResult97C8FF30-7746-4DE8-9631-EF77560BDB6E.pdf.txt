BACKGROUND. Carboplatin-based regimens have demonstrated activity in pediatric
patients with low-grade glioma (LGG). However, carboplatin hypersensitivity reaction
(Cb HSR) represents a common and limiting factor for the continuation of therapy.

METHODS. The objectives of this study were to describe the prevalence, characteristics, and management of Cb HSR and to detail their impact on outcome. The
authors conducted a comprehensive, national, retrospective review of children
who were diagnosed with LGG between 1985 and 2004 and received treatment
with carboplatin.
RESULTS. One hundred five patients from 10 Canadian centers were included.
The median patient age at diagnosis was 3.5 years (range, 0.3–16.8 years), and 33
patients (31.4%) had neurofibromatosis type 1. Carboplatin was administered
monthly in 46 children and weekly in 59 children. Forty-four patients (41.9%)
developed Cb HSR after a median of 10.5 infusions (range, 3–39 infusions). Cb

HSR occurred significantly earlier among children on the weekly schedule (4.4
months vs 9.1 months; P 5 .02). The first allergic reaction was grade I or II in 36
patients (82%). The cumulative incidence of Cb HSR increased with the number
of infusions, and there was no evidence of a plateau. The only predictive factor
was being a girl rather than a boy (P 5 .02). Thirty-four of 44 patients with Cb
HSR were re-exposed to carboplatin, and 24 of 34 patients (70.5%) had recurrent

Cb HSR in Children With LGG/Lafay-Cousin et al.

ovarian and lung cancers. Carboplatin usually is tolerated well and has moderate side effects. However,
greater and prolonged use of carboplatin has resulted
in an increased incidence of carboplatin-related
hypersensitivity reaction (Cb HSR).1 The incidence of
Cb HSR in patients with ovarian cancer who were
treated on carboplatin-containing regimens was up
to 16%.2–5
In children, carboplatin is used in the treatment
of various solid tumors, such as neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, germ cell tumors, hepatoblastoma, and
several types of benign and malignant brain tumors.6
Cb HSR has been described mostly in pediatric series
of low-grade glioma (LGG), in which the reported
incidence ranges from 7% to 32%; however, recent
series consistently have suggested a higher incidence
of approximately 30%.7–10 Although the characteristics Cb HSR have been described extensively and analyzed in large cohorts of adult patients, its
description in the pediatric population remains
limited.
To avoid the discontinuation of carboplatin in
children who have developed Cb HSR, various protocols of desensitization and/or premedication have
been proposed. However, very little is known regarding the outcome of such strategies, and reports of
desensitization are limited primarily to small series.9,11–13 To date, no large pediatric series on Cb
HSR and its management has been described.
The primary objective of the current study was
to describe the prevalence of Cb HSR in an unselected national cohort of children with LGG who
received carboplatin-containing regimen. The secondary objectives were to determine predictive factors for Cb HSR; to describe the subsequent
management of Cb HSR in children, including the
use of premedication and/or desensitization; and to
determine whether the occurrence of Cb HSR has an
impact on outcome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This retrospective study was open to all centers in
the Canadian Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium
(CPBTC), which is a group of 17 Canadian pediatric
institutions that collaborate and develop research in
pediatric neuro-oncology. Participating centers communicate on a monthly basis through a telemedicine
system. Eligible patients were children with LGG who
fulfilled the following criteria: 1) diagnosed between
1985 and 2004, 2) age <18 years at diagnosis, and 3)
pathologically confirmed diagnosis of LGG except for
optochiasmatic tumors with typical features of LGG
on neuroimaging studies, especially in the context of

893

neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Tumors included
were World Health Organization grade 1 and 2 LGG
tumors, including pilocytic astrocytoma and pilomyxoid variant.14,15 Tumors that occurred anywhere
within the central nervous system could be included.
Exclusion criteria were previous treatments with
radiation and/or chemotherapy before carboplatinbased chemotherapy. Surgical resection before carboplatin-based treatment was defined as gross total
resection if there was no residual disease on postsurgical imaging studies, biopsy if <10% of the tumor
was removed, and incomplete resection for all
remaining patients who underwent surgery. The evaluation of tumor response to chemotherapy was
based on radiology review when available and/or radiology reports. A complete response was defined as
no detectable disease. A partial response was defined
as a decrease >50% in tumor size, and an objective
effect was defined as a decrease >25% but <50% in
tumor size. Progressive disease was defined as an
increase in tumor size >25%, and stable disease (SD)
was used to classify all other situations.
Several different carboplatin-based regimens
were used over the study period. Carboplatin was
administered either monthly (median dose, 560 mg/
m2 per infusion) or weekly (175 mg/m2 per infusion)
with or without vincristine with a planned duration
of treatment ranging from 12 months to 18 months.
In patients with Cb HSR, investigators were
asked to describe the chronology and the pattern of
symptoms and to grade the severity of the reaction
according to the Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (version 3.0) (see Table 1).16 They
provided information on subsequent management
(continuation or discontinuation of carboplatin,
desensitization techniques) and outcome. The study
was approved by the research ethics board of each
participating institution.

Statistical Analysis
To address the primary objective, the prevalence of
Cb HSR was described. Cumulative incidence curves
were used to describe the probability of developing
Cb HSR according to the length of exposure to carboplatin and the number of courses of carboplatin
administered. Potential predictors of Cb HSR were
assessed by using chi-square analysis or the Fisher
exact test for categorical variables and logistic regression for continuous variables. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used to estimate probabilities of progression-free survival (PFS). The potential impact of
Cb HSR on survival was examined by using the logrank test. Statistical significance was considered as a
P value <.05. All statistical analyses were performed

Nine patients had documented dissemination at presentation. Of the 75 patients who underwent surgery
at the time of diagnosis, 33 patients underwent a biopsy only, and 40 patients underwent an incomplete
resection. Two patients who underwent an initial
gross total resection eventually progressed and
required chemotherapy.

Carboplatin Therapy
The median time from diagnosis to the initiation of a
carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimen was 1.4
months (range, 0.1–130.9 months). Carboplatin was
received as a single agent by 7 patients, in combination
with etoposide by 1 patient, and with vincristine by the
remaining patients. Carboplatin was administrated
monthly in 46 patients (43.8%) patients for a median
total duration of 11 months (range, 1–20 months) and
weekly in 59 patients (56.2%) for a total duration of
12 months (range, 0.7–20.9 months) (Table 2). Prophylactic premedication (corticosteroid and/or antihistamine) in the absence of a history of hypersensitivity
reaction was received by 15 children (14.5%).

RESULTS
Patient Population
Ten centers participated with a total of 111 eligible
patients. Two patients were excluded because of
insufficient data, and 4 patients were excluded
because they still were receiving carboplatin chemotherapy at the time of analysis. Therefore, 105
patients were included in this study. Table 2 illustrates the population’s characteristics. Tumor locations outside the diencephalon included the spinal
cord, brainstem, posterior fossa and tectal region,
cerebral hemisphere, and isolated optic nerve. Of the
79 children with histologically proven diagnoses, 73
had pilocytic astrocytoma or low-grade astrocytoma
not otherwise specified. Other pathologic diagnoses
included pilomyxoid astrocytoma (n 5 3 patients),
mixed oligodendroglioma (n 5 1 patient), grade 2
astrocytoma with dense desmoplastic reaction (n 5 1
patient), and invasive ganglioglioma (n 5 1 patients).

Cb HSR
Forty-four patients (41.9%) developed Cb HSR. The
median time from treatment initiation to Cb HSR
was 6.5 months (range, 0.4–15.4 months) after a median of 10.5 carboplatin infusions (range, 3–39 infusions). Cb HSR occurred significantly earlier during
the weekly schedule, at median of 4.4 months (range,
0.4–15.4 months), compared with a median of 9.1
months (range, 3.1–14.6 months) on the monthly
schedule (P 5 .02). The occurrence of hypersensitivity reaction was not related to a specific cumulative
dose of carboplatin. The cumulative incidence of Cb
HSR increased with the number of infusions without
any plateau effect (Fig. 1).
Table 3 illustrates that, among demographic factors, only sex was associated significantly with Cb
HSR. Of the children with Cb HSR, 32 of 44 patients
(72.7%) were girls compared with 29 of 61 girls

(47.5%) among the patients without Cb HSR
(P 5 .02); thus, girls had a relative risk for Cb HSR of
1.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.12–3.30). Age, NF1
status, and tumor location were not associated with
Cb HSR. The schedule of carboplatin administration
(weekly or monthly) did not significantly influence
the incidence of Cb HSR. Five of 15 patients who
received prophylactic premedication developed Cb
HSR (2 patients developed grade I Cb HSR, 1 patient
developed grade II Cb HSR, and 2 patients developed
grade III Cb HSR). Prophylactic premedication did
not prevent Cb HSR significantly and did not influence the severity of the reaction (grade III and IV
toxicity; 40% vs 15.3%; P 5 .22).
Of the 44 children who developed Cb HSR, the
severity of the first reaction was grade I or II in 36
patients (82%), grade III in 6 patients (13.6%), and
grade IV in 2 patients (4.6%) (Table 4). Data on
symptoms at the onset of Cb HSR relative to carboplatin infusion times were available in 28 patients.
Most of the reactions occurred half-way through the
infusion (n 5 16 patients) or at the end of the infusion (n 5 10 patients). One patient had symptoms at
initiation of the infusion, and another patient developed delayed skin rash (grade I) >12 hours after
completing the infusion. After the first episode of Cb
HSR, carboplatin was discontinued in 10 patients.
The reason for discontinuation was reported as the
physician’s decision in 9 patients without any correlation to the severity of the initial hypersensitivity
reaction (3 grade I reactions, 3 grade II reactions, 3
grade III reactions, and 1 grade IV reaction). Six of

those patients did not receive any further treatment,
and 4 patients were switched to another chemotherapy regimen (2 patients switched to combined vincristine and etoposide; 1 patient switched to
vinblastine; and 1 patient switched to combined procarbazine, carmustine [CCNU], and vincristine
[PCV]).
Among the 44 patients who developed Cb HSR,
34 patients (77.2%) were re-exposed to carboplatin
with desensitization, premedication, or both. Premedication consisted of antihistamine administration
with or without corticosteroid and was initiated from
3 days to 1 hour before carboplatin infusion; in some
patients, it was continued for 24 hours after carboplatin infusion. Desensitization consisted of a progressive increase in the rate of the carboplatin
infusion over various periods (from 1 hour to 6
hours) according to previously described schedules.11,12 Of the 34 re-exposed patients, 21 patients
initially received premedication alone without a
desensitization schedule. Desensitization subsequently was added in 3 patients who continued to

have signs of Cb HSR despite premedication. In total,
18 patients were re-exposed with premedication
alone, and 12 patients were re-exposed with both
premedication and desensitization The 4 remaining
patients were rechallenged without any premedication or desensitization and were managed symptomatically with steroid and/or antihistaminic or
with a reduced infusion rate if they had recurrent
symptoms.
By using premedication alone, 10 patients
(55.5%) were able to complete their carboplatin treatment, including 7 patients who had no further allergic manifestations (38.8%). Among the 12 patients
who underwent desensitization and premedication,
only 1 patient (8.3%) was able to complete his carboplatin therapy (P 5 .018). Three of the 4 patients who
were managed only symptomatically completed their
carboplatin therapy. In the fourth patient, carboplatin therapy was discontinued at the request of the
parents.
Twenty-four of 34 rechallenged patients (70.5%)
experienced recurrent Cb HSR. Upon re-exposure, 4
of 18 patients (22.2%) who received premedication
alone and 7 of 12 patients (58.3%) who received both
desensitization and premedication had worsening of
their hypersensitivity symptoms (P 5 .05). However,
the incidence of grade III and IV symptoms at the
time of carboplatin re-exposure did not differ significantly between the group that received premedication alone (44.4%) compared with the group that
received both desensitization and premedication
(41.6%; P 5 .4). The median number of additional
carboplatin infusions delivered with altering Cb HSR
therapies was 4 (range, 0.5–34 additional infusions).
Because of recurrent hypersensitivity symptoms
despite altering Cb HSR therapies, carboplatin was
discontinued in 20 patients. Four patients were
observed without further chemotherapy, 2 patients
underwent surgical resection, and 14 received
another noncarboplatin-containing chemotherapy
regimen, including 7 patients who received weekly
vinblastine; 4 patients who received either combined
thioguanine, procarbazine, and CCNU or combined
thioguanine and PCV; and 3 patients who received
another line of chemotherapy. The median duration
of second-line chemotherapy was 7 months (range,
2–14 months). None of the patients received radiotherapy.

Impact of Cb HSR on Outcome
With a median follow-up of 5.1 years (range, 0.3–16.7
years) after diagnosis, 57 patients (54.3%) required
further treatment for disease progression or relapse
at a median of 21.3 months (range, 0.6–95.9 months).

FIGURE 2. Progression-free survival (PFS). Cb HSR indicates carboplatin
hypersensitivity reaction; 1, positive; 2, negative.

Fourteen (24.5%) progressions occured during administration of the carboplatin-based regimen.
In the entire group, the 5-year PFS and overall
survival (OS) rates were 49.6%  5.5% and 91.5%  3.2%,
respectively. The 5-year PFS rate did not differ significantly between patients who did and did not develop Cb HSR (53.9%  9.4% vs 45.7%  6.8%,
respectively; P 5 .1) (Fig. 2).
In trying to understand why PFS did not differ
between patients with and without Cb HSR, we compared the total duration of chemotherapy in both
groups (including initial carboplatin and subsequent
regimens after Cb HSR). The median total duration
of chemotherapy did not significantly differ for
patients who did and did not experience Cb HSR
(13.2 months and 11.3 months, respectively).

DISCUSSION
The results from this retrospective, cooperative study
indicated that 42% of children with LGG who were
received a carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimen
developed Cb HSR during the course of their treatment. Our findings are important, because, to our
knowledge, this study represents the largest pediatric
series to date focusing on Cb HSR in LGG and its
specific management.
This prevalence of Cb HSR is greater than what
was reported in other pediatric studies. In their initial reports on the carboplatin-vincristine combination, Packer et al. quoted a frequency of 7%.7,17 In a
series of 29 children, Lazzareschi et al. reported 6

Cb HSR in Children With LGG/Lafay-Cousin et al.

patients (20%) who developed Cb HSR.9 More
recently Gnekow et al. reported the results of the
German Hirntumor (HIT)-LGG 1996 protocol, in
which 32% of 123 patients developed Cb HSR using
a monthly schedule of administration.10 The lower
prevalence of Cb HSR in previous reports may be
related to an underreporting of mild reactions. Conversely, because Cb HSR was the focus of our attention, we may have optimized the reporting of Cb
HSR.
We observed that girls were significantly more
likely to develop Cb HSR than boys. To our knowledge, this finding has not been reported previously.
However, the lack of such literature is not surprising, because the majority of studies that have
focused on Cb HSR arose from 2 distinct adult oncology populations, patients with ovarian cancer
and patients with lung cancer. Because these 2
types of cancers are strictly or relatively sex-specific, a sex effect would not be discernable in such a
setting. However, Navo et al. recently analyzed the
incidence of Cb HSR in 1324 patients with a variety
of tumor types who received treatment with carboplatin.18 Fifty-seven percent of those patients were
girls. The authors reported an incidence of Cb HSR
of 2.6% in the total population (n 5 1324 patients)
compared with 7.9% in the ovarian cancer population (n 5 277 patients). Although the authors mentioned that their population of patients who were
treated for ovarian cancer received significantly
greater numbers of cycles of carboplatin to explain
the higher incidence, it is noteworthy that 91.2% of
the patients in their study who developed Cb HSR
were women, although the authors did not comment on this point.
The first hypersensitivity reaction, as reported
previously in adult and pediatric patients, tended to
occur around the 10th carboplatin infusion.4,8,9,19 It
appeared to be related to the cumulative number of
infusions rather than the cumulative dose of carboplatin.1,20 Throughout the treatment of these
patients, the cumulative incidence of Cb HSR kept
increasing with the number of infusions and did not
seem to reach any plateau. Schiavetti et al. also
reported a similar pattern of cumulative risk.8
In contrast with the experience reported by Yu
et al.,21 in our experience, patients who received
weekly dosing had a similar incidence of Cb HSR
compared with patients who received monthly dosing. However, reactions occurred 3 months earlier in
the weekly dosing group (4.4 months vs 9.1 months
after treatment initiation; P 5 .016).
The majority of initial reactions were mild to
moderate in severity, in agreement with previous

897

reports.1,2,8 Nonetheless, 2 patients presented initially
with grade IV reactions. This potential and unpredictable adverse event certainly contributes to the
subjective decision to discontinue the therapy after
the first reaction regardless of its severity.22–24 The
potential benefit of Cb HSR-altering treatments to
rechallenge allergic patients remains unclear. In our
experience, patients who received prophylactic premedication were just as likely to develop Cb HSR.
We did not observe a significant benefit of adding a
desensitization approach to premedication as a Cb
HSR-altering treatment. Paradoxically, in our experience, this approach appears to be associated with a
significantly lower rate of completing carboplatin
treatment and higher rate of worsening allergic
symptoms. This failure of desensitization differs from
prospectively reported successful experiences of
desensitization in women with ovarian carcinoma
who developed Cb HSR.19,25 There is no clear explanation for this unexpected finding. One of the reasons may be a difference in the amount of
premedication used before desensitization compared
with strategies that used a premedication alone
approach. In addition, because desensitization was
used in only 2 of the participating centers, a center
effect with a lower individual level of tolerance of
recurrent symptoms may contribute toward explaining these findings. The retrospective nature of
our study also may limit the interpretation of these
findings.
At best, approximately 50% of patients who were
rechallenged with premedication alone were able to
complete their therapy, but the majority of attempts
remained unsuccessful. Furthermore, the median
number of 4 additional carboplatin infusions delivered (range, 1–36 additional infusions) was relatively
low. It is even more noteworthy that 32% of patients
presented with a more severe reaction upon re-exposure. Similar findings were reported by Rose et al.26
Carboplatin-based regimens have an interesting
efficacy/toxicity ratio in children with LGG. Outpatient administration enhances better quality of life.
However, the development of allergic hypersensitivity
may challenge the rationale of pursuing carboplatin
therapy, which, although it has a proven antitumor
effect in LGG,7,10 suddenly, it is associated with an
adverse effect that has potential life-threatening consequences in the context of a benign tumor. Furthermore, although the exact mechanism of carboplatin
hypersensitivity remains unclear, the different clinical
patterns of allergic reactions suggest that several
immune pathways may be involved, like type I immunoglobulin E-mediated reaction or mast cell
degranulation, leading to histamine release.11,28 The-

898

oretically, type I allergic reactions may lead to
decreased half life, decreased availability, and, thus,
decreased activity.28
In addition, the cumulative dose for steroids suggested in successful reports of altering Cb HSR therapies may be considerable, particularly in children
who are scheduled to receive weekly carboplatin for
1 year.11,12,27 This may have important short- and
long-term consequences, such as mood changes,
weight gain, and osteoporosis.29,30 The reported experiences of successful desensitization have required
rigorous protocols, sometimes involving critical care
unit availability and prolonged administration schedules.12 Such strategies are time consuming, costly,
and add a significant burden and anxiety to the
patient, family, and caregivers.
Although some authors have tried to detect predictive factors for carboplatin hypersensitivity,31,32
currently, there is no accurate predictive factor to
identify which patients truly will benefit from altering Cb HSR techniques, and no definitive recommendation could be drawn from our experience.
When a patient has a demonstrated response to a
carboplatin-based regimen, Cb HSR-altering strategies may be justified as an attempt to salvage an
effective therapy. This may be justified for patients
who develop allergic reactions as a late event. However, when Cb HSR occurs early during treatment,
appreciation of response may not be predictable, and
the benefit of continuing carboplatin should be
balanced against the risk of a more severe allergic
reaction and the overall burden of desensitization
strategies. Because the number of successful re-exposures was relatively low, our experience suggests that
the chance to complete therapy upon re-exposure
will be limited in a child with an early onset of Cb
HSR. For patients with an early onset allergic reaction, alternative chemotherapy regimens that offer a
good efficacy rate without evidence of long-term toxicity should be considered instead.33 In patients with
carboplatin allergy, the current International Society
of Pediatric Oncology LGG protocol discourages
attempts to continue therapy by means of desensitization and suggests alternative combinations, such
as vincristine plus cyclophosphamide or vincristine
plus cisplatin.34
We did not observe a difference in PFS according
to the presence or absence of Cb HSR. Such information on patients with Cb HSR is unlikely to be
obtained from prospective clinical trials, because
patients registered in these protocols who develop
Cb HSR often are excluded from study; thus, their
data may be censored or incomplete. Gnekow et al.
provided some information on second-line regimens

that were used for children with Cb HSR enrolled in
the HIT LGG 1996 study. However no specific survival analysis was provided on that subgroup of
patients.10
In our experience, the majority of patients who
developed Cb HSR eventually discontinued carboplatin, and a significant number (18 of 44 patients) were
switched to an alternative chemotherapy regimen.
The 2 groups (with Cb HSR and without Cb HSR)
had a similar overall duration of chemotherapy when
the duration of treatment after the switch to a noncarboplatin regimen was added to the initial duration
of carboplatin-based regimen in patients who developed Cb HSR. The similar duration of treatment may
have contributed to the similar PFS in both groups.
In conclusion, the results from this cooperative
study indicated that approximately 40% of children
with LGG who received a carboplatin-based regimen
developed Cb HSR. Being a girl was identified as a
risk factor for Cb HSR. Altering Cb HSR strategies did
not prevent worsening of recurrent allergic symptoms. We did not observe a significant benefit from
desensitization/premedication approaches compared
with premedication alone. The prolonged use of steroids is associated with the risk of long-term side
effects, which should be taken into account in the
context of a benign tumor. The effect of Cb HSR on
the 5-year PFS rate was not statistically significant.
Because the incidence of Cb HSR is significant, protocols and prospective studies that use prolonged
carboplatin-containing regimens should include
recommendations for the management of these reactions, including guidelines for discontinuation and
switching to alternative chemotherapy regimens.
