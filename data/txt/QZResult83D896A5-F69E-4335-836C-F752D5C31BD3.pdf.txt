BACKGROUND: Doxorubicin is associated with progressive cardiac dysfunction, possibly through the formation of doxorubicin-iron
complexes leading to free-radical injury. The authors determined the frequency of hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations associated
with hereditary hemochromatosis and their relationship with doxorubicin-associated cardiotoxicity in survivors of childhood high-risk
acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: Peripheral blood was tested for 2 common HFE allelic variants: C282Y and H63D. Serum
cardiac troponin-T (cTnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), which are biomarkers of cardiac injury and
cardiomyopathy, respectively, were assayed during therapy. Left ventricular (LV) structure and function were assessed with echocardiography. RESULTS: A total of 184 patients had DNA results for at least 1 variant, and 167 had DNA results for both: 24% carried
H63D and 10% carried C282Y. Heterozygous C282Y genotype was associated with multiple elevations in cTnT concentrations
(P 5.039), but not NT-proBNP. At a median of 2.2 years (range, 1.0 years-3.6 years) after diagnosis, the mean Z-scores for LV fractional shortening (20.71 [standard error (SE), 0.25]; P 5.008), mass (20.84 [SE, 0.17]; P <.001), and end-systolic (24.36 [SE, 0.26],
P <.001) and end-diastolic (20.68 [SE, 0.25]; P 5.01) posterior wall thickness were found to be abnormal in children with either allele
(n 5 32). Noncarriers (n 5 63) also were found to have below-normal LV mass (20.45 [SE, 0.15]; P 5.006) and end-systolic posterior
wall thickness (24.06 [SE, 0.17]; P <.001). Later follow-up demonstrated similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Doxorubicin-associated myocardial injury was associated with C282Y HFE carriers. Although LV mass and wall thickness were found to be abnormally low overall,
they were even lower in HFE carriers, who also had reduced LV function. Screening newly diagnosed cancer patients for HFE mutaC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are reported to have long-term event-free survival rates of > 80%.1
Late effects often include anthracycline-associated cardiovascular abnormalities.
Among more than 300,000 childhood cancer survivors in the United States,2 > 50% have been treated with anthracyclines.3 Anthracyclines have been associated with progressive cardiotoxicity.4 Thus, understanding the causes, mechanisms, and magnitude of doxorubicin-related cardiotoxicity is important. Reducing cardiotoxicity could improve longterm survivor outcomes.
The risk of doxorubicin-associated cardiotoxicity is greater in girls, those with Down syndrome, and those treated at
younger ages, with higher doxorubicin dose rates and cumulative doses, as well as with longer follow-up since receiving

doxorubicin.4-6 However, some patients appear to be
more vulnerable than others, independent of these risk
factors. Identifying those patients at the highest risk of
developing late cardiotoxicity is a priority because they
should be the focus of alternative chemotherapies7 and
novel preventive treatments to maintain oncologic efficacy while reducing toxicity and late effects.
Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity is caused, in
part, by myocardial doxorubicin-iron complexes generating doxorubicin semiquinone free radicals, which after
reacting with oxygen lead to lipid peroxidation and DNA
damage.8,9 The cardioprotective properties of dexrazoxane, a compound that chelates iron thereby reducing this
free radical formation, when administered before doxorubicin supports this hypothesis.10,11
We hypothesized that conditions leading to higher
iron tissue concentrations may favor the development of
doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. In vitro and animal studies
have suggested that tissue iron-loading potentiates anthracycline cardiotoxicity, and increases biomarker concentrations of cellular damage.8,12
Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic
iron metabolism disorder resulting in iron overloadassociated tissue injury. The most common HH diseaseassociated gene relates to specific alleles of the hemochromatosis gene (HFE); the majority of affected individuals
carry at least 1 copy of a founder mutation, C282Y.
Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation is present in
approximately 52% to 100% of patients with HH.13
Adults with non-cancer-associated idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and early pathologic left ventricular (LV)
remodeling14 are reported to have higher C282Y homozygosity than healthy controls.15
Postmortem testing of an anthracycline-naâ‚¬Ä±ve
patient aged 14 years with high-risk ALL, iron overload,
hepatic failure, and cardiac dysfunction revealed a homozygous C282Y mutation, confirming previously undiagnosed HH.16 Other alleles, such as H63D, are less
frequently associated with clinical disease,13 but may be
more commonly found in non-cancer-associated, idiopathic, dilated cardiomyopathy compared with healthy
controls.17
Given the importance of iron,8,12 and the potential
genetic involvement18,19 in anthracycline-induced cardiac
injury, we determined HFE disease-associated allelic frequency in patients considered to be at risk of doxorubicin
cardiotoxicity. Awareness of the frequency of the HFE
disease allele in children with ALL who are treated with
doxorubicin may help clarify the relationship between
their genetic predisposition to cardiotoxicity and cardio3556

vascular status. If HFE gene mutations predict late cardiotoxicity, then patients with HFE mutations could be
identified at the time of diagnosis and be given cardioprotective agents to minimize their cardiac risk.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants

Between 2005 and 2007, patients with high-risk ALL
treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) ALL
Consortium protocols from 1991 onward and who had
no prior history of disease recurrence were enrolled in
this study. Informed consent was obtained from parents
if the patient was aged  18 years and directly from
patients aged > 18 years. The total planned cumulative
doxorubicin dose for high-risk patients was 300 mg/m2
to 360 mg/m2.
HFE Genotyping

Five mL of peripheral blood was drawn from each patient,
with 2.5-mL shipped to the DFCI central testing laboratory for genetic analysis.
Cell Purification

Mononuclear cell fractions were obtained using standard
methods. Blood was diluted with an equal volume of
serum-free medium and mixed gently. The sample was
layered on top of Ficoll (10 mL of Ficoll and 25 mL of
diluted blood per 50-mL conical bottom Falcon tube
[BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif]) and then centrifuged
for 30 minutes at 1500 revolutions per minute at room
temperature. The mononuclear cell layer from the
Ficoll:plasma interface was placed into a new 50-mL tube
and brought to 5-mL with RPMI medium. The pellet was
washed twice, resuspended, and counted in an automated
cell counter. Cell concentrations were adjusted to approximately 106/mL. The pellet was frozen in 1-mL aliquots at
280 C for several hours and transferred to liquid
nitrogen for long-term storage. Approximately 1.5 3 106
cells were kept unfrozen to generate DNA.
DNA Isolation

Isolated DNA was prepared using NucleoSpin DNA
isolation kits (BD Biosciences/Clontech, Mountain View,
Calif) in all samples at the time of mononuclear cell fraction isolation. Sample volume was adjusted to 200 lL
(1.5 3 106 cells), and 25 lL to 50 lL proteinase K was
added. After adding 200 lL to 400 lL of Buffer B3, the
mixture was incubated at 70 C for 60 minutes. The
sample was vortexed after 210 lL to 420 lL of 96% to
100% ethanol was added, placed in the NucleoSpin

column, and centrifuged at 11,000 3 g for 1 minute at
room temperature. The flow-through was discarded; 500
lL of buffer BW was added to the spin column and centrifuged at 11,000 3 g for 1 minute at room temperature.
Buffer B5 (600 uL) was added to the spin column and
centrifuged at 11,000 3 g at room temperature. The
flow-through was discarded and the column was recentrifuged at 11,000 3 g at room temperature to remove B5
completely. The column was placed in a 1.5-mL tube,
eluted with 50 lL to 100 lL of BE buffer (warmed to
70 C) by incubation for 10 minutes, and then centrifuged. Contaminating protein and DNA were measured
by ultraviolet spectroscopy. DNA was stored at 280 C.
Detection

The 2 most common HFE alleles associated with HH, the
cysteine-to-tyrosine substitution at amino acid position
282 (C282Y) and the histidine-to-asparatic acid substitution at amino acid position 63 (H63D), were detected by
directly sequencing genomic DNA with a commercial,
clinically validated kit (PyroMark HFE Cat #40-0053;
Biotage LLC, Charlotte, NC) run on a Pyrosequencer
instrument (PSQ HS 96; Biotage) or by Sequenom
(Sequenom Inc, San Diego, Calif) and TaqMan (Life
Technologies Inc, Carlsbad, Calif) genotyping assays
performed at the Harvard Partners Center for Genetics
and Genomics.
Genetic Counseling

Before enrolling, patients and families were invited to
undergo genetic counseling regarding study implications.
Results were disclosed to patients with a homozygous
HFE deficiency because this may precede clinically significant iron overload, and retesting in a Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory
was advised.
Sample Collection for Biomarkers

The DFCI protocol 91-01 study20 was conducted before
serum cardiac biomarkers were collected. Patients from
this cohort were excluded from the cardiac biomarker
analysis, but were included in all other analyses.
At the time of enrollment on DFCI protocols 95-01
and 00-01, serum samples were collected at the time of
diagnosis, daily for 1 week after the first induction doxorubicin dose, before each subsequent doxorubicin dose,
and for 7 days after the final doxorubicin dose.20 Serum
was stored at 270 C until analysis. Hemolyzed samples
were excluded. Cardiac troponin-T (cTnT) concentrations were determined centrally using the Elecsys
Cancer

October 1, 2013

Troponin-T STAT Immunoassay (sensitivity, 0.01 ng/
mL; Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, Ind).
Concentrations of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic
peptide (NT-proBNP) were measured using an immunoassay (sensitivity, 5 pg/mL; Elecsys immunoanalyzer,
Roche Diagnostics). Concentrations of cTnT > 0.01 ng/
mL and NT-proBNP concentrations > 150 pg/mL in
infants aged < 1 year or > 100 pg/mL in children
aged  1 year at the time of sample collection indicated
myocardial injury and cardiomyopathy, respectively.
Cardiac Assessment

Echocardiograms were obtained at the time of diagnosis,
after doxorubicin therapy, and every 2 years thereafter at
local treatment sites and were centrally remeasured at a
single facility by study staff blinded to treatment status.21
Children were eligible for cardiac follow-up throughout
their first continuous complete remission. LV status was
assessed with LV end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions; LV mass; LV end-systolic and end-diastolic posterior wall thicknesses; LV thickness-to-dimension ratio;
and LV fractional shortening, an index of LV systolic
performance influenced by heart rate, LV preload, LV
afterload, and LV contractility.
We standardized echocardiographic measurements
with Z-scores,22 which are the number of standard deviations the measurement is above or below the mean value
of a normative population, to adjust for age, body surface
area, and growth-related changes. We calculated Z-scores
from the difference between LV outcome values in
patients and known values in healthy children, divided by
the standard deviation of a distribution of values in
healthy children.
We calculated the predicted value for each outcome
in healthy children with a regression model, using data
from 285 healthy children measured in a single center
and in the same manner as the study patients.23,24 The
Z-scores for LV mass, LV end-systolic and end-diastolic
posterior wall thicknesses, and LV dimensions were
adjusted for body surface area, and Z-scores for LV
fractional shortening were adjusted for age at
echocardiography.
Statistical Analysis

Means of normally distributed outcome variables
(eg, echocardiographic measurements) were compared
with Student t tests; means of non-normally distributed
variables (eg, age) were compared using Wilcoxon rank
sum tests. Differences in the percentages of dichotomous

values (eg, mutation carrier) between groups were
compared with Fisher exact tests.
For associations with serum cardiac biomarkers,
each HFE variant was dichotomized into carriers or
noncarriers, and wild-type only. For associations with
echocardiographic Z-scores, the 2 loci were combined as a
result of a small sample. Carriers were heterozygous or
homozygous for either H63D or C282Y, and noncarriers
were wild-type only for both. Unadjusted and adjusted
logistic regression analyses of multiple abnormalities in
NT-proBNP and cTnT concentrations were performed
to determine the association with HFE carrier status for
both H63D and C282Y both combined and separately.
The models were adjusted for treatment including doxorubicin with and without dexrazoxane. All analyses were
performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
For the 184 high-risk ALL patients, the median time from
registration on the original ALL therapy protocol to
enrollment on the HFE testing protocol was 7.0 years
(range, 1.1 years-17.1 years). Of these, 68 patients (37%)
had received doxorubicin alone and 116 (63%) had
received dexrazoxane and doxorubicin (Table 1).
Genetic detection was successful for 172 patients for
H63D and 179 patients for C282Y. Two patients (1%)
were homozygous and 39 (23%) were heterozygous for
H63D. One patient (< 1%) was homozygous and 17
patients (9%) were heterozygous for C282Y. Of the 167
patients with results for both tests, 113 (68%) were homozygous wild-type at both loci.
The percentage of patients with  2 abnormal cTnT
concentrations during doxorubicin therapy was higher in
C282Y carriers than in noncarriers (31% vs 6%) (Table 2).
Multiple elevations in the cTnT concentration were
found to be associated with carriers of the C282Y allele
(odds ratio [OR], 7.23 [95% confidence interval (95%
CI), 1.78-29.4]; P 5 .006) on univariate analyses. This
association remained significant after adjusting for dexrazoxane treatment (adjusted OR, 9.21 [95% CI,
1.11-76.5]; P 5 .039). No associations were found with
NT-proBNP. Neither H63D heterozygosity nor homozygosity was found to be associated with either cardiac
biomarker (data not shown).
At a median of 2.2 years after diagnosis (range, 1.0
years-3.6 years), mean Z-scores for LV mass and endsystolic posterior wall thickness were significantly worse
than normal for all children (carriers: mean Z-score,
20.84 [standard error (SE), 0.17; P < .001]; and 24.36

[SE, 0.15; P 5 .006] and 24.06 [SE, 0.17; P < .001],

thickness (20.68 [SE, 0.25]; P 5 .011) (Table 3).
Although the power to detect such differences was
reduced in later follow-up due to the number of echocardiograms available, similar results were obtained and no
differences in Z-scores between carriers and noncarriers
were detected. The median follow-up for the 114 patients
with a postbaseline assessment was 6.1 years (range, 1.0
years-16.1 years).
DISCUSSION
In the current study of survivors of childhood high-risk
ALL, heterozygosity for C282Y was associated with multiple elevations in cTnT concentrations after controlling for
dexrazoxane treatment. Furthermore, compared with a

normal population, patients with the C282Y and/or
H63D allelic variants had significantly lower LV function,
LV mass, and wall thickness 2 years after diagnosis.
The HFE prevalence in the current study is similar
to that of the US population, in which the estimated prevalence for C282Y-H63D heterozygosity is between 1.5%
and 2.5%.25 For the C282Y mutation, the prevalence is
7% to 9% for heterozygotes and 0.12% to 0.5% for
homozygotes.25 For the H63D mutation, the prevalence
is 20% to 23% for the heterozygotes and 1.5% to 2.4%
for the homozygotes.25
The results of both in vitro and animal studies have
suggested that iron-loaded tissues enhance anthracycline
cardiotoxicity, which increases concentrations of markers
of cellular damage.12,26 HFE gene mutations predispose
rodents to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.26 Mice
with a targeted mutation of the HFE gene (homozygotic
HFE 2/2 mice) were found to have iron overload in
multiple organs, including the heart, compared with wildtype controls.26 In addition, when treated with doxorubicin, HFE 2/2 mice were found to have concentrations of

serum markers for acute cardiac injury, mitochondrial
damage, myofibril degeneration, and mortality that were
significantly higher than those in wild-type mice. In HFE
heterozygotic mice (HFE1/2), chronic doxorubicin
administration caused mitochondrial degeneration and
increased mortality rates, although not to the same extent
as in HFE 2/2 animals.26 This result suggests that homozygous or heterozygous mutations of HFE or perhaps
even of other genes linked to increased iron stores and
HH may increase susceptibility to doxorubicin
cardiotoxicity.
The magnitude of the Z-score differences in the current study, although small relative to those that guide the
daily clinical decisions made by cardiologists, are consistent with findings in pediatric cancer survivors treated with
doxorubicin,4-6 who years later have increased rates of
congestive heart failure (CHF) and cardiac mortality compared with controls.27 Although there were no significant
differences noted between carriers and noncarriers in
the current study, the Z-scores are characteristic of
anthracycline-associated cardiomyopathy in that acute

evidence of injury is often followed by normalization of
ventricular size and function, presumably by ventricular
remodeling (cellular hypertrophy compensating for cell
loss). Nonetheless, late evidence of abnormal ventricular
structure with reduced LV wall thickness is a frequent outcome.4 Furthermore, the risk of anthracycline-related
CHF may be modified by the presence of HFE variants,
as shown in anthracycline-treated survivors of hematopoietic cell transplantation.28
Cascales et al retrospectively evaluated cardiac iron,
cardiac events, and HFE genotypes (C282Y and H63D) in
97 consecutive autopsy results from patients with solid and
hematological cancers, 48 of whom had been treated with
anthracyclines and 49 who received no chemotherapy
(n 5 25) or nonanthracycline chemotherapy (n 5 24).29
Patients treated with cumulative anthracycline doses > 200
mg/m2 were found to have higher heart iron concentrations
(490 lg/g dry weight vs 240 lg/g dry weight; P 5 .01), independently of liver iron load or transfusion history, compared with controls. Mutations in HFE were associated
with higher iron deposits in the heart tissue, but not with
global cardiac events or CHF. Multivariate linear regression
demonstrated that both HFE genotypes and anthracyclines
contributed to cardiac iron concentrations (q 5 0.284), a
result suggesting cardiac iron accumulation modulation by
3560

both anthracyclines and HFE and thereby supporting the
significance of HFE status as a predictor of anthracycline
cardiotoxicity.29
Myocardial injury (elevated cTnT) during doxorubicin therapy in patients with C282Y alleles puts them at
a greater risk of subsequently reduced LV wall thickness
and mass due to loss of cardiomyocytes during therapy.
In the current study, carriers were found to have
significantly reduced LV function 2 years after the diagnosis of ALL compared with healthy children, a finding
that was only marginally observed when ALL noncarriers were compared with healthy children. This suggests
that the remaining cardiomyocytes are adversely affected
by the combination of HFE carrier status and doxorubicin therapy, going beyond cardiomyocyte demise during
therapy (elevated cTnT concentrations), resulting in late
reduced LV wall thickness and mass being the sole type
of late doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Unhealthy residual
myocardium in long-term ALL survivors treated with
doxorubicin who are also carriers of HFE alleles is supported by a reduced LV thickness-to-dimension ratio, a
trend consistent with early pathologic LV remodeling in
this population. Such an association has been described
in HFE carriers without cancer with idiopathic dilated
cardiomyopathy.13

HFE Mutations and Survivor Cardiac Status/Lipshultz et al

Patients with C282Y homozygosity are reported to
more frequently have genetic variations in antioxidant
enzymes and mitochondrial DNA, which may increase
their susceptibility to myocardial iron-induced oxidative
stress and dysfunction, respectively.30,31
Dexrazoxane iron chelation therapy may prevent the
enhanced doxorubicin-mediated damage in an ironoverloaded heart.32 Children with high-risk ALL who are
treated with dexrazoxane before doxorubicin administration are reported to have fewer and milder subclinical biomarker and echocardiographic signs of cardiotoxicity.32-38
Identifying all patients at high risk of anthracyclineinduced cardiotoxicity is difficult because factors known
to increase this risk do not identify many patients who
subsequently develop cardiomyopathy.6,8 Although generalized population screening for HFE mutations is not
recommended, case-finding by using HFE screening in
high-risk groups to detect affected individuals might be
beneficial.39 Screening for HFE mutations common in
children with newly diagnosed high-risk ALL who are to
be treated with anthracyclines might inform treatment
decisions regarding chemotherapy, cardioprotectant therapy, transfusions, and magnetic resonance imaging to
determine early myocardial iron overload.13,40
