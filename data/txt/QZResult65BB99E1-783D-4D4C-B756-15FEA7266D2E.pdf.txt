ABSTRACT
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its primary enzymatic product, prostaglandin E2
(PGE2), are associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer. In order to elucidate the
factors contributing to intratumoral PGE2 levels, we evaluated the expression of COX2/PGE2 pathway members MRP4, the prostaglandin transporter PGT, 15-PGDH (PGE2
metabolism), the prostaglandin E receptor EP4, COX-1, and COX-2 in normal, luminal,
and basal breast cancer cell lines. The pattern of protein expression varied by cell line
reflecting breast cancer heterogeneity. Overall, basal cell lines expressed higher COX-2,
higher MRP4, lower PGT, and lower 15-PGDH than luminal cell lines resulting in higher
PGE2 in the extracellular environment. Genetic or pharmacologic suppression of MRP4
expression or activity in basal cell lines led to less extracellular PGE2. The key finding
is that xenografts derived from a basal breast cancer cell line with stably suppressed
MRP4 expression showed a marked decrease in spontaneous metastasis compared to
cells with unaltered MRP4 expression. Growth properties of primary tumors were not
altered by MRP4 manipulation. In addition to the well-established role of high COX-2
in promoting metastasis, these data identify an additional mechanism to achieve high
PGE2 in the tumor microenvironment; high MRP4, low PGT, and low 15-PGDH. MRP4
should be examined further as a potential therapeutic target in basal breast cancer.

for women with tumors expressing these receptors.
Alternatively, 10-15% of all breast cancers do not express
any of these receptors and are referred to as Triple
Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) [3]. Lacking tumorspecific molecular targets, TNBCs are treated via surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiation but nevertheless have a worse
prognosis compared to other subtypes of breast cancer [4].
Cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2)
catalyze the rate-limiting step in the production of
eicosanoids from arachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty
acid found in the cell membrane. The main eicosanoid
product found in tumors is the inflammatory mediator
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) [5, 6]. Like other cancers of
epithelial origin, aberrant expression of COX-2 is found

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed
cancer among women in the U.S. and is the second
leading cause of cancer-related mortality in this population
[1]. Metastatic disease is the cause of the majority of
cancer-related death [1]. Elucidating and targeting
the processes that lead to metastasis could prevent
mortality due to breast and other cancers. Breast cancer
is a heterogeneous disease that is typically classified
according to the expression of three cell surface receptors,
i.e. estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2
receptor [2]. Estrogen receptor and HER2 can be targeted
therapeutically which leads to a more favorable prognosis

in approximately half of all breast cancers, and elevated
COX-2 and PGE2 levels are associated with a poor
prognosis [5–10]. PGE2 is actively exported by multiple
drug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4) into the
extracellular space where it can bind one of four cognate,
G-protein coupled receptors (EP1-4) and induce several
signaling pathways [11–23]. Activation of EP2 and EP4
receptors has been associated with several contributing
factors in tumor progression including angiogenesis,
cellular proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis,
immune evasion, and support of a cancer stem-like cell
phenotype [14–23]. MRP4 has been associated with a
poor prognosis in tumors of the blood, brain, colon, liver,
lung, pancreas, and prostate, but has only been briefly
described in breast cancer [24–31]. Extracellular PGE2 can
be imported through the prostaglandin transporter (PGT)
via exchange with intracellular lactate and metabolized
by 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) [32–36].
15-PGDH is a tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer as
lack of sufficient expression of this enzyme can result in
the accumulation of PGE2 thus leading to sustained PGE2
signaling [35, 37]. Metabolized PGE2 cannot bind EP
receptors; therefore, PGT and 15-PGDH are both required
to terminate PGE2-activated signaling [38].
Using large publicly available data sets, we recently
reported that MRP4, PGT and 15-PGDH were differentially
expressed among distinct breast cancer molecular subtypes
[39]. In basal type breast cancer or TNBC, high COX2, high MRP4, low PGT, and low 15-PGDH mRNA
expression levels were observed. The current study
examines the functional significance of this observation.

and T47D cells was higher than in the four basal cell lines
(Figure 1A). The observed protein expression pattern for
15-PGDH is characteristic of a tumor suppressor gene [35,
37]. Consistent with a house-keeping role, COX-1 protein
expression was detected in all cell lines (Figure 1A). COX-2
protein was detected in four of seven cell lines (Figure 1A).
The EP4 receptor has been detected at multiple sizes
due to the extent of glycosylation of the protein; the apparent
size ranging between 47 and 65 kDa. EP4 expression at the
larger (65 kDa) isoform was detected at similar levels in all
cell lines except BT549 which had barely detectable EP4
expression at this size. Higher expression of the 47 kDa
isoform was detected in the basal cell lines compared to
normal (MCF10A) and luminal cell lines (Figure 1A).
Taken together these studies reveal complex
expression patterns of PGE2 family members in individual
cell lines reflecting the marked heterogeneity of human
breast cancer. In each cell line, a different combination of
these proteins could lead to dysregulated levels of PGE2
in the tumor microenvironment; however, some general
patterns have emerged. We saw that more aggressive cell
lines generally express higher levels of MRP4 and reduced
levels of PGT and 15-PGDH. The net result would be
higher levels of PGE2 in the tumor microenvironment
due to increased PGE2 export by MRP4 and decreased
PGE2 import and metabolism via PGT and 15-PGDH,
respectively. Conversely, less aggressive, luminal cell
lines tended to have lower levels of MRP4, higher levels
of PGT, and higher levels of 15-PGDH expression.
These patterns are consistent with our previous report
that primary basal type or TNBC breast cancers typically
express high COX-2, high MRP4, low PGT, and low
15-PGDH mRNA, and also with our mRNA expression
analysis of these cell lines (data not shown) [39].
Given these differential expression patterns of the
PGE2 pathway members, we asked what impact these
differences have on net PGE2 production by breast cancer
cells. We analyzed PGE2 production in conditioned media
via ELISA and saw that MDA-MB-436 cells produce
high levels of PGE2 (4.82 pg/μg cellular protein) (Figure
1B). These cells express both COX-1 and COX-2 proteins
along with elevated MRP4 and reduced PGT (Figure 1A).
BT549 cells accumulate moderate levels of PGE2 (1.16
pg/μg cellular protein) in conditioned media (Figure 1B).
These cells do not express high levels of COX-2; however,
they express elevated levels of MRP4 while not expressing
15-PGDH that would metabolize any PGE2 produced from
COX-1 (Figure 1A). PGT expression is also low in these
cells so that extracellular PGE2 would not be imported
efficiently and could accumulate in the conditioned
media. PGE2 levels were low in the conditioned media
of MCF7 cells (Figure 1B) consistent with the negligible
expression of COX-2 and MRP4. Thus, PGE2 detected
in the conditioned media would be dependent on COX1 and export would be dependent on the low level of
MRP4 or passive diffusion (Figure 1A). In addition,

RESULTS
Based on our previous observations that primary
breast cancers of molecularly defined subtypes differentially
expressed members of the COX-2/PGE2 pathway at the
mRNA level, we characterized a panel of breast cancer
cell lines reflecting breast cancer subtypes to further test
the hypothesis that aggressive, metastatic, and basal
type breast cancers would display a pattern of COX-2
pathway expression leading to high PGE2 in the tumor
microenvironment. MRP4 protein expression was elevated
in the MCF10A (normal mammary epithelium), MDAMB-231 (basal), MDA-MB-436 (basal), and BT549 (basal)
cell lines compared to MCF7 (luminal) and MDA-MB-468
(basal) cells (Figure 1A). MRP4 was not detected in T47D
(luminal) cells. Overall, elevated MRP4 expression was
somewhat correlated with cell lines of aggressive molecular
subtype (basal) compared to luminal malignant cell lines.
MCF10A cells had the highest PGT protein
expression (Figure 1A). T47D, MDA-MB-231, and BT549
cell lines displayed moderate levels of PGT while MCF7,
MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-436 cell lines expressed
either low or no detectable PGT. Expression of the PGE2metabolizing enzyme, 15-PGDH, in MCF10A, MCF7,

MCF7 cells express 15-PGDH which would suppress
the amount of PGE2 detected in the conditioned media
from these cells. T47D cells favor PGE2 metabolism as
there was less PGE2 detected in the conditioned media
compared to the unconditioned media (Figure 1B). The
PGE2 detected in the unconditioned media likely came
from the serum component of the growth media. Since
T47D cells express PGT and high levels of 15-PGDH,
they are poised to robustly metabolize PGE2, even though
COX-2 is expressed (Figure 1A). These cells also lack
MRP4 expression so PGE2 is not actively exported (Figure
1A). Likewise, a net decrease in PGE2 was also detected
from the growth media of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure
1B). This is consistent with the low endogenous COX-2
levels in these cells and moderate expression of MRP4,
PGT, and 15-PGDH (Figure 1A). 15-PGDH expression
in MDA-MB-436 cells is equal to other cells that do not
accumulate PGE2 in the conditioned media, but since
the ratio of MRP4-to-PGT is high, any PGE2 in the cells
would be exported instead of being metabolized.

Since MRP4 exports PGE2 from a variety of cell
types, elevated MRP4 expression in the tumor could be a
mechanism by which malignant cells maintain elevated
PGE2 in the tumor microenvironment [13, 25, 29–31, 40,
41]. In order to determine the role of MRP4 in PGE2 export
from tumor cells, we used both genetic and pharmacologic
approaches to perturb MRP4 activity and measured PGE2
accumulation in the conditioned media of two basal type cell
lines. The MDA-MB-231 cell line expresses elevated levels
of MRP4, and PGE2 production is inducible by inflammatory
stimuli. The migratory and metastatic behaviors of MDAMB-231 cells are partially dependent on PGE2 signaling
[42]. The MDA-MB-436 cell line expresses high MRP4
and produces PGE2 without exogenous stimulation. MDAMB-231 cells were treated with PMA (phorbol ester) to
induce COX-2 and accumulation of PGE2 in the conditioned
media [43]. We employed siRNA targeting of ABCC4 to
reduce expression of MRP4 and examined the level of PGE2
in the conditioned media. Using two siRNA constructs,
we achieved significant (35-75%) reduction in MRP4

expression relative to scramble control cells (Figure 2B). In
MDA-MB-231 cells, stimulation with PMA (80 nM, 1 hr)
resulted in a 25-fold increase in PGE2 accumulation in the
conditioned media compared to unstimulated cells (Figure
2A). Fifty-four to sixty-six percent less PGE2 was exported
from MDA-MB-231 cells when they were transfected with
siRNA targeting ABCC4 and briefly stimulated with PMA
compared to PMA-treated scramble siRNA control (p <
0.05). The PGE2 export role of MRP4 was confirmed in a
second basal type cell line. Like MDA-MB-231 cells, MDAMB-436 cells accumulated significantly less PGE2 in the
conditioned media when MRP4 expression was reduced with
siRNA (Figure 2C, 2D).
Stable MRP4 knockdown clones from MDAMB-231 cells were also generated and characterized for
decreased MRP4 expression. MRP4 protein expression
was reduced by 62-67% relative to vector control (Figure
2E). MDA-MB-231 cells (one clone and one pooled
population) with decreased MRP4 expression were briefly
stimulated with PMA to induce COX-2 and to produce
PGE2. As observed in transient MRP4 knockdown, cells
with decreased MRP4 expression exported less PGE2
compared to vector control confirming the results obtained
using transient gene silencing (Figure 2F).
Two pharmacologic inhibitors of MRP4 (Tyrphostin
AG1478, MK571) were also employed to evaluate the role
of MRP4 in PGE2 export. PMA-stimulated MDA-MB-231
cells or MDA-MB-436 cells were treated with inhibitor
and evaluated for PGE2 accumulation in the conditioned
media. Tyrphostin AG1478, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor
with recently identified inhibitory activity on MRP4 [44],
inhibited PGE2 accumulation in both cell lines in a dosedependent manner (Figure 3A, 3C). In MDA-MB-231
cells, PGE2 export was decreased by 92%, 65%, and 36%
in the presence of Tyrphostin AG1478 at 10, 5, and 2.5
μmol/L, respectively (p < 0.001). Likewise, PGE2 export
by MDA-MB-436 cells was significantly decreased
by 52%, 46%, and 14% in the presence of Tyrphostin
AG1478 at 10, 5, and 2.5 μmol/L, respectively (p < 0.01).
Treatment with 50 μM, but not 25 μM, MK571 resulted in
a reduction in the level of PGE2 in the conditioned media
of both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells when
compared to vehicle control (Figure 3B, 3D).
Suppression or inhibition of MRP4 decreases the
export of PGE2 from basal or TNBC breast cancer cells.
Conversely, MCF7 cells were used for MRP4 overexpression experiments due to the low level of endogenous
MRP4 expression as well as being representative of an
estrogen and progesterone receptor positive, luminal
subtype cell line. MCF7 cells were transfected to express
either empty vector control or an MRP4 expression
plasmid (pcDNA3.1(-)-MRP4-Zeo) and two lines were
selected (MCF7-MRP4-2 and MCF7-MRP4-3) along with
a control line stably expressing empty vector (MCF7-Vec).
MRP4 expression in MCF7-MRP4-2 and MCF7-MRP4-3
cells was 70-100-fold higher than in MCF7-Vec cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 4A). The ectopically expressed MRP4 protein was
determined to be the correct size via western blot suggesting
that post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation,
were properly applied. Compared to MDA-MB-436 cells,
MCF7-Vec cells accumulate less PGE2 overall, reflecting
the lower endogenous COX-2 levels observed in these cells
(Figure 1 and Figure 4). PGE2 release is modestly increased
by stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 ug/mL, 24
hours), but this increase was not statistically significant and
was not further enhanced by over-expression of MRP4 in
these cells (Figure 4B). This suggests that the combination
of COX-2 expression and enforced MRP4 expression in
MCF7 cells is not sufficient to accumulate PGE2 in the
conditioned media.
In order to confirm that these genetic (RNAinterference and over-expression) and pharmacologic
approaches were specifically affecting MRP4 functions, we
employed a drug resistance assay to determine the effect of
these perturbations on the sensitivity of these cells to the
cytotoxic drug 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), a known substrate
for MRP4 [45]. In the instance of high MRP4 expression
and activity, 6-MP does not accumulate in the cell to the
degree that causes cytotoxicity and apoptosis; this reduced
cytotoxicity is expressed as an increase in IC50.
MRP4 expression was suppressed via siRNA or
shRNA in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, and BT549
cells, and sensitivity to 6-MP was determined and expressed
as the IC50. The ratio of the IC50 of cells transfected with
siRNA against ABCC4 compared to the IC50 of control
transfected cells was calculated and this ratio is expressed
as “fold sensitization.” In MDA-MB-231 cells (moderate
basal MRP4 expression), reducing the level of MRP4 by
either siRNA or shRNA resulted in an approximate 2-fold
increased sensitivity to 6-MP (Table 1). Clones MDAMB-231 shMRP4-B and MDA-MB-231 shMRP4-C had
an approximate 80% decrease in MRP4 expression relative
to vector control (data not shown). In MDA-MB-436 and
BT549 cells (high basal MRP4 expression), reducing the
expression of MRP4 using siRNA resulted in a 1.43–1.74fold increase in cytotoxicity mediated by 6-MP. These data
are consistent with a mechanism by which reduced MRP4
expression leads to reduced export of 6-MP resulting in
higher accumulation of 6-MP and enhanced cell killing.
Conversely, MCF7 cells that stably over-express MRP4
(MCF7-MRP4-2, MCF7-MRP4-3) were approximately
2-fold more resistant to 6-MP (higher IC50) when compared
to MCF7 cells expressing empty vector, consistent with
increased export of 6-MP (Table 1). Consistent with the
genetic data, MRP4 inhibition with MK571 or Tyrphostin
AG 1478 also increased the sensitivity to 6-MP in the three
MRP4-expressing basal cell lines. Table 2 summarizes the
fold sensitization as a result of treatment with MK571 or
Tyrphostin AG 1478. Inhibitor concentrations were selected
such that inhibitor treated cells had equivalent viability to
vehicle-treated cells after 3 days. Pharmacologic inhibition
of MRP4 by MK571 resulted in a 1.47, 1.76, and 2.946544

fold increase in sensitivity to 6-MP in MDA-MB-436,
BT549, and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. Tyrphostin
AG 1478 (10 μM) induced a 2.86- and 4.83-fold increase
in sensitivity to 6-MP in MDA-MB-436 and BT549 cells,
respectively. The modulation of resistance to 6-MP by
targeting MRP4 shows that these perturbations specifically
affect MRP4 and not the entire PGE2 pathway.
Independent of MRP4 expression level, treatment
of MDA-MB-231 cells with a range of exogenous PGE2
did not significantly affect proliferation of these cells (data
not shown). Additionally, we saw no significant change
in proliferation when MRP4 protein levels were altered
genetically (data not shown).

Since elevated COX-2 and PGE2 levels are
indicators of poor prognosis in several types of cancer
including breast, and we have shown that MRP4
contributes to the amount of PGE2 produced by breast
cancer cells, we investigated the role of MRP4 on both
primary tumor growth and metastatic potential. MDAMB-231 cells (5x105) stably expressing vector control
or shRNA targeting MRP4 along with stable expression
of the luciferase enzyme (MDA-MB-231 shRNA/Luc,
Figure 5A) were implanted subcutaneously proximal to
the mammary fat pad of female BALB/c SCID mice;
tumor growth was monitored by caliper, and metastatic
spread was estimated by bioluminescent imaging [46].

At day +90, 9 of 10 mice injected with either MDAMB-231 shVec/Luc or MDA-MB-231 shMRP4-C/Luc
had developed subcutaneous tumors. All ten mice injected
with MDA-MB-231 shMRP4-D/Luc cells had established
subcutaneous tumors. Mean tumor volumes were not
different among mice injected with control versus either
MRP4 knockdown cell line (Figure 5B). Upon reaching
18 mm in longest tumor diameter, mice were euthanized;
blood, lung, and tumor tissues were collected for analysis.
Tumor weight upon necropsy was used as a confirmatory
measure of tumor growth. Consistent with the estimated
tumor volumes, excised tumor weight was not significantly
different among the three cell lines expressing different
levels of MRP4 (Figure 5C). We observed a similar
expression pattern of ABCC4 mRNA among the tumor
tissues generated from the knockdown cell lines (Figure
5D) compared to the protein expression of the primary cell
lines used for injection (Figure 5A). Tumors derived from
MDA-MB-231 shVec/Luc cells had higher ABCC4 mRNA
expression compared to tumors derived from MDA-

MB-231 shMRP4-C/Luc or MDA-MB-231 shMRP4-D/
Luc MRP4 knockdown clones indicating that the tumor
MRP4 phenotype at the end of the observation period
reflected the phenotype of the initial implanted tumor
cells. Based on these observations, we conclude that the
absence of any effect of MRP4 downregulation on primary
tumor growth is not due to upregulation of MRP4 in vivo.
Whole-animal bioluminescence imaging was
monitored over the course of tumor growth in order
to detect spontaneous metastases from the mammary
gland-implanted tumor. We detected markedly
more bioluminescence in the lungs of mice injected
with vector control MDA-MB-231 shVec/Luc cells
compared to the mice injected with either of two MRP4
knockdown clones (MDA-MB-231 shMRP4-C/Luc and
MDA-MB-231 shMRP4-D/Luc) (Figure 6A). Thus,
differences in MRP4 expression did not impact the
growth of the primary tumor, but had a profound effect
on the ability of tumor cells to establish spontaneous
pulmonary metastases. Bioluminescence in the lungs

time, consistent with the continuing expansion of
metastatic lesions whereas very little, if any, growth of
either cell line expressing shMRP4 occurred during the
observation period. The reduced metastatic potential
in MRP4 knockdown cells was confirmed in a second
independent experiment (data not shown). In order to
confirm the presence of human breast cancer cells in the

human GAPDH (using human-specific GAPDH primer
set) compared to mouse Gapdh mRNA. When the

expression (MDA-MB-231 shMRP4-C/Luc, MDAMB-231 shMRP4-D/Luc) (Figure 6B).

DISCUSSION

which prompted the current study to characterize the
functional importance of this pattern. The current study
further supports our central hypothesis that the COX-2/
PGE2 pathway is dysregulated in aggressive cancers [7,
8, 47]. We have now shown that breast cancer subtypes
have different expression profiles of the PGE2 pathway
members and that MRP4 expression was strongly elevated
in aggressive (IDC, TNBC, basal type) breast cancer cell
lines relative to less aggressive, luminal cell lines. Given

We recently reported the analysis of gene expression
of COX-2 pathway members in a large publicly available
breast cancer database [39]. That study identified a pattern

that MRP4 is also expressed in normal epithelium, it was
not surprising that we detected this protein in MCF10A
cells; however, in malignant cell lines, MRP4 expression
correlated with an aggressive phenotype [13, 40]. We also

saw a trend of decreased 15-PGDH protein expression
in aggressive breast cancer cell lines relative to normal
mammary epithelium consistent with the reported tumor
suppressor role of 15-PGDH [35, 37]. These data support

the hypothesis that other members of the PGE2 pathway
besides COX-2, in particular MRP4, PGT, and 15-PGDH,
may have an impact on the intratumoral levels of PGE2 [5,
7, 9, 34, 38, 48].
Previously unknown, we have now shown that
breast cancer cells with elevated MRP4 expression
would be able to more efficiently export PGE2 into the
microenvironment. A tumor microenvironment with
elevated PGE2 could be established and sustained when
MRP4 expression is elevated even in tumors in which
COX-2 expression is not elevated, and this identifies a
second potential mechanism, beyond COX-2, to achieve
high PGE2 in the tumor microenvironment. This model of
high-MRP4 expression also assumes low expression of
PGT and 15-PGDH which would otherwise metabolize
intratumoral PGE2. We demonstrate that, in TNBC
particularly, MRP4 could also play a role in maintaining
a tumor microenvironment with elevated PGE2 levels,
a clinical parameter that has been associated with poor
outcome [5, 15, 49, 50]. Notably, MRP4 but not MRP1-3
or MRP5 transports PGE2 (and PGE1) [51]. In addition
to PGE2, MRP4 exports nucleoside analogs, e.g. cAMP
and cGMP, which could contribute to malignant behavior.
While previous findings from our group and others
suggest that metastatic potential downstream of PGE2/EP4
signaling is not strictly dependent on cAMP [16, 19, 52],
we cannot rule out a role of nucleoside transport by MRP4.
Future studies will examine these additional potential
mechanisms by which MRP4 promotes metastasis.
We have now shown that suppressing MRP4
expression leads to decreased metastatic potential. We
showed previously that PGE2 activates EP4 to support
breast cancer metastasis [16, 53]. Our current studies
support the hypothesis that elevated MRP4 could be a
mechanism underlying high PGE2/EP4 signaling and
this mechanism may be particularly important in basal
and TNBC. There is extensive literature demonstrating
that high PGE2 is associated with enhanced metastatic
potential [5, 47, 54]. Consistent with this mechanism,
we observed reduced metastatic capacity from mammary
gland implanted tumors with reduced MRP4 expression.
Growth of primary tumors was not apparently affected by
changes in MRP4 levels.
PGE2 elicits diverse biological responses in tumor
cells and heterogeneous tumor tissue in a cell type-specific
manner [42]. PGE2 signaling is not directly associated
with proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells.
Increased MRP4 expression has been correlated with
increased proliferation in other tumor types but this
was not linked mechanistically to PGE2 production [24,
27, 28, 31]. Reducing expression of MRP4 in either
MDA-MB-436 or MDA-MB-231 cells did not affect
cell proliferation in vitro. We have shown that MRP4
contributes to PGE2 accumulation in vitro and metastatic
progression in vivo, but this does not definitively exclude
the possibility that another substrate of MRP4 besides
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PGE2 is also contributing to these effects. MDA-MB-436
cells express both COX-1 and COX-2, and PGE2 content
in the conditioned media of these cells is influenced by
the activity of MRP4. Consistent with the proliferation
data, we did not see differences in primary tumor growth
with respect to MRP4 expression level in MDA-MB-231
xenograft experiments; we further conclude that MRP4
does not directly affect cell proliferation. These data
are consistent with the reports that PGE2 is not directly
associated with proliferation in all breast cancer [42].
Taken together, we show that suppression of MRP4
expression in a metastatic, basal type breast cancer cell line
(MDA-MB-231) decreased the ability of a subcutaneous
primary tumor to develop spontaneous metastases when
compared to MDA-MB-231 cells with high endogenous
levels of MRP4. Our findings are consistent with our
central hypothesis that MRP4 is functioning in the tumor
microenvironment of the established primary tumor
by increasing the level of PGE2 which can act in an
autocrine or paracrine manner and is available to diverse
cells in the heterogeneous tumor, enhancing metastatic
potential and progression of the tumor. MRP4 could be
a contributing factor in the accumulation of PGE2 in the
tumor microenvironment preferentially in TNBC and basal
subtype tumors compared to luminal breast tumors and
should be considered as a potential molecular target in this
subtype with overall poor outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human cell lines originally obtained from ATCC
(Manassas, VA) were cultured in a 5% CO2 atmosphere
at 37°C. MCF10A cells were maintained in DMEM/F12
(Corning, Corning, NY) supplemented with 5% horse
serum, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 10 μg/ml
insulin, 1 ng/ml cholera toxin, 100 μg/ml hydrocortisone,
1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin. The following breast
cancer cell line media (Corning) was supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gemini Bio-products,
Atlanta Biologicals), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gemini
Bio-products), and 2 mM L-glutamine (Gemini Bioproducts). MCF7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468
cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium
(DMEM) with 1 g/L glucose. T47D cells were grown in
RPMI 1640 medium. MDA-MB-436 cells were grown in
DMEM/F12 medium. BT549 cells were grown in DMEM
with 4.5 g/L glucose. Cell lines were recently (June, 2016)
authenticated by STR typing using the Promega Geneprint
10 system in comparison to ATCC STR databases. At the
same time, the GenePrint 5x mouse primer pair mix was
used to rule out contamination with mouse DNA.
Control and shRNA plasmids (Origene) targeting
ABCC4 were transfected into retroviral packaging
phoenix cells (Allele Biotechnology, San Diego, CA)
with Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher). Fortyeight hours after transfection, retrovirus-containing

medium was collected and centrifuged to pellet any cell
debris. The supernatant containing the viral particles
was transferred to new tubes and stored at -80°C. Viral
medium was added with 4 μg/mL polybrene (American
Bioanalytical) to MDA-MB-231 cells for 2 days before
being passaged into 1.0 μg/mL puromycin (Invitrogen)
selection. After 1 week of selection, surviving cells were
characterized by quantitative PCR and western blot for
ABCC4/MRP4 knockdown compared to vector control
cells, and the pooled populations with the greatest
knockdown were subcloned for further characterization.
Clones derived from puromycin-resistant single-cell
cultures with stable MRP4 knockdown were cultured with
viral media containing a luciferase expression plasmid
for 3 days before being passaged into hygromycin B
selection (Corning). After 2 weeks, resistant cells were
characterized for luciferase expression by adding luciferin
(PerkinElmer) (250 μg/mL) to the cells and evaluating
bioluminescent intensity via luminometer (Berthold
Technologies, U.S.A., Oak Ridge, TN). Signal 200-fold
over background was considered sufficient for use in
in vivo experiments.
MRP4 over-expression was performed both
transiently and stably. Transient transfection of MCF7
cells with the MRP4 expression plasmid pcDNA3.1(-)
MRP4-Zeo (a generous gift from H. Hayashi, University
of Tokyo) or pcDNA3.1(+)-Zeo (a generous gift from
I. Lindberg, University of Maryland) empty vector was
conducted using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher)
at a ratio of 2 μg DNA to 3 μL Lipofectamine 3000.
Stable MRP4 expressing MCF7 sub-lines were generated
similar to the transient cells, but with the addition of
Zeocin (100 μg/mL) (Thermo Fisher) to growth media.
Cells were passaged every 3-4 days with fresh Zeocin.
After 3 weeks, surviving cells were characterized by
western blot for relative MRP4 expression. Two cell
lines expressing MRP4 (MCF7-MRP4-2 and MCF7MRP4-3) and one cell line expressing vector (MCF7Vec) were used to evaluate PGE2 accumulation and 6-MP
resistance.

using the 2-ΔΔCt method with GAPDH as the reference
gene. Results are representative of replicate experiments
and expressed as relative expression ± standard deviation
[55].

Protein isolation
Total cellular protein was collected from cultured
cells following a wash with cold phosphate buffered
saline (PBS). Lysis buffer was comprised of RIPA
buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 1% protease
inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF, Sigma-Aldrich), sodium orthovanadate
(2 mM, Sigma-Aldrich), and sodium fluoride (5 mM,
New England Biolabs). Lysis buffer was added to
adherent cells and incubated on ice for 10 minutes.
Alternatively, cells were detached using trypsin,
resuspended in growth media, and centrifuged. The cell
pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer. Lysates were
vortexed 2-3 times over 20 minutes and otherwise kept
on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 8000
x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Clarified, soluble protein was
transferred to a new tube and stored at -80°C. Protein
concentration of these clarified lysates was determined
by the Bradford protein quantification assay (Thermo
Fisher Scientific).

Western immunoblotting
Equal amounts of protein (20-50 μg) were combined
with 4x Laemmli sample buffer and β-mercaptoethanol
(2.5% final) (Bio-Rad) and incubated at 95°C for 5
minutes before being loaded into SDS-PAGE gels for
electrophoresis. Separated proteins were transferred to
PVDF membrane using the Trans-Blot Turbo system (BioRad) and blocked in 5% milk in wash buffer (phosphate
buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween-20, PBS-T). Membranes
were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies
under gentle rocking. Membranes were washed and
incubated for 1 hour with secondary antibodies at room
temperature under gentle rocking. Membranes were
incubated in an ECL (Pierce, Bio-Rad, or GE) reagent for
5 minutes and exposed to x-ray film to obtain the relative
protein expression. Primary antibodies against COX-2,
EP4, 15-PGDH, and PGT were from Cayman Chemical
(Ann Arbor, MI). Primary antibodies against COX2 and COX-1 were from Cell Signaling Technologies
(CST). Primary antibody against MRP4 was from Enzo
Life Sciences (M4I-10). The primary antibody against
beta-actin (AC-15) was from Sigma-Aldrich. Milk (5%)
in PBS-T was used for diluting primary and secondary
antibodies. Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibodies were used in the following
concentration ranges: anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad) 1:5,000, antimouse (KPL) 1:5,000 – 1:10,000, and anti-rat (CST)
1:3,000 – 1:5,000.

RNA, cDNA, qPCR
Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using
the NucleoSpin RNA kit (Machery-Nagel) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Isolation of RNA for
siRNA screening was performed using the DirectZol
RNA isolation kit (Zymo). Total RNA from mouse tissue
was isolated using TRIzol following the manufacturer’s
protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA was
synthesized from 500-1000 ng total RNA using the qScript
cDNA SuperMix (Quanta) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. ABCC4 and GAPDH expression were
performed in triplicate using probe-based primer sets and
iQ Supermix (Bio-Rad) with approximately 100 ng cDNA
per reaction. Relative gene expression was determined

PGE2 levels in conditioned media were determined
using the Prostaglandin E2 EIA kit (Cayman Chemical)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For
normalization, PGE2 content is expressed in pg/μg cellular
protein. When using MDA-MB-231 cells for PGE2 export
experiments, cells were stimulated with 80 nM PMA
(Sigma-Aldrich) in fresh growth medium for 1 hour at
37°C. Stimulation media was removed and replaced with
fresh growth media for 16 hours at 37°C. The conditioned
medium and whole cell lysate were collected and stored
at -80°C. MRP4 inhibitors were added to both stimulation
and replacement media when indicated. MCF7 cells
were stimulated with 10 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS,
Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 hours and conditioned medium was
collected along with total cellular protein.

Human breast cancer xenograft
MDA-MB-231 cells (5x105) stably expressing
both shRNA targeting ABCC4 and luciferase were
injected subcutaneously into female BALB/c-SCID mice
(Jackson). The MDA-MB-231 cell line was selected for
these xenograft experiments as it reliably established
tumors and spontaneous metastatic lesions. Tumor growth
was measured twice weekly and approximate tumor
volume was calculated by “Volume = (A)(B2)(π/6),” where
A = long diameter and B = perpendicular diameter. All
animal experiments were conducted in compliance with
