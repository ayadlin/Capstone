Abstract
We have used yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a tool to
identify the importance of mitochondrial processes involved
in arsenic-induced carcinogenicity in humans. We screened
466 single-gene knockout strains of yeast S. cerevisiae known
to be involved in biogenesis of mitochondria for sodium
arsenite (AsIII) and sodium arsenate (AsV) sensitivity. We
identified 72 arsenite-sensitive and 81 arsenate-sensitive
mutants. We categorized the identified mutants based on the
various mitochondrial processes, including nucleic acid
metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, protein synthesis,
and vacuolar acidification. We have identified 65 human
orthologues to proteins involved in arsenite sensitivity and
3 human orthologues to arsenite resistance. Furthermore,
23 human orthologues to arsenate sensitivity and 20 human
orthologues to arsenate-resistant proteins, including MSH3,
COX10, GCSH, PPOX, and MTHFD1, were also identified. Using
PathwayAssist software, we did cellular network analysis
between identified mitochondrial proteins. Three types of
interactions, (a) protein-protein interactions, (b) common
transcriptional regulators, and (c) common target genes, were
identified. We found that RTG (retrograde) genes involved in
mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling regulate both arsenite
sensitivity and resistance. Furthermore, our study revealed
that ABF1, a multifunctional transcriptional factor, regulates
genes involved in both arsenite and arsenate sensitivity and
resistance. However, REB1 and RAP1 transcriptional regulators were common to only arsenate- and arsenite-sensitive
genes, respectively. These studies indicate that multiple
pathways involved in mitochondrial biogenesis protect yeast
S. cerevisiae from arsenic-induced toxicity. Together, our
studies suggest that evolutionary conserved mitochondrial
networks identified in yeast S. cerevisiae must play an
important role in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis in humans.

Introduction
Human exposure to arsenic poses a global health problem
affecting millions of people worldwide (1, 2). The situation has been
described as ‘‘humanity’s biggest mass poisoning’’ (3). Arsenic is
a metalloid and is ubiquitously present in the environment (4).
Exposure to arsenic leads to variety of diseases, including cancer,
cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease, as well as neurologic and neurobehavioral disorders (5). Exposure to arsenic is

associated with lung, skin, liver, bladder, kidney, and prostate
cancer (6). Although arsenic is shown to be human carcinogen,
studies have failed to produce tumors in laboratory animals and
data for animal carcinogenicity have proven to be inconclusive (2).
Despite its carcinogenic effects in humans, arsenic-containing
drugs are used for therapy of cancer. Arsenic trioxide is used for
treatment of refractory and newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic
leukemia (7, 8). However, neither the mechanisms of arsenicinduced carcinogenesis nor arsenic-induced cancer cell death is
well understood (9).
Recent studies report that mitochondria are important targets of
arsenic-induced carcinogenesis and cell death (7, 8, 10). Arsenic is
accumulated in mitochondria via phosphate transport proteins
and the dicarboxylate carrier (11, 12). When injected in rabbits,
arsenic is also accumulated in vivo in the mitochondria of kidney
(13). Once accumulated in mitochondria, arsenic uncouples the
oxidative phosphorylation because ATP synthase undergoes
oxidative arsenylations (14).
We have used Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to
understand the mitochondria-mediated mechanisms of arsenicinduced carcinogenicity and cell death in humans. Baker’s yeast
S. cerevisiae is the most well studied eukaryotic organism for study
of fundamental cellular mechanisms common to all eukaryotes
(15). S. cerevisiae was the first eukaryotic organism whose entire
genome was sequenced. The complete nucleotide sequence was
published in 1996, which identified f6,300 genes in yeast (16, 17).
Single-gene knockout of every gene has been constructed (18).
Genome-wide screens for functional characterization of yeast
genes direct us toward investigating other eukaryotic genomes,
including the human one. S. cerevisiae also has had a great effect on
establishing the molecular mechanisms of human diseases. This is
supported by the fact that f30% of map-based genes that have
been identified in human diseases have yeast homologues (19).
Recently, a systematic genome-wide functional screen identified
466 genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function (20).
In this study, we used these single-gene deletion strains to
determine the role of mitochondrial function in arsenic-induced
response in S. cerevisiae. Following this genetic screen, we have
identified number of human homologues of yeast genes, indicating
their potential important role in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis in
humans.

Materials and Methods
Medium, Solutions, and Strains
All yeast strains were grown in YPD complete medium (1% bacto-yeast
extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% dextrose, and 2% bacto-agar for plates),
with addition of 100 AL/mL ampicillin. Sodium arsenite(III) and sodium
arsenate(V) were from Sigma and prepared as stock solutions in sterile
water.
For growth inhibition assays, S. cerevisiae RKY3109 (MATa ura3-52

haploid MATa deletion strains (21) derived from parental strain BY4741.
Collection was a gift from Dr. Lene Rasmussen (Roskilde University,
Roskilde, Denmark). Four hundred and sixty-six strains from this collection,
known to be involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and function, were
identified and used for the screening purpose (20).

Growth Inhibition Assay

Figure 1. Arsenite sensitivity of WT (RKY3109) and rhoj yeast cells.
Logarithmically growing cultures of both strains were inoculated into three
different concentrations of sodium arsenite [medium without any sodium arsenite
was used as negative control (‘‘untreated’’)] and exposed for 24 h. Appropriate
dilutions of cells were than plated on YPD plates and grown at 30jC, and
after 2 d, colonies were counted. Percentage of survival was calculated relative
to untreated control. Data represent the average from three independent
experiments.

used. For a test of arsenic sensitivity of mutants in retrograde response
pathway, wild-type (WT) strain PSY142 (MATa leu2 lys2 ura3) and isogenic
retrograde mutants rtg1 D (PSY142 rtg1 D::URA3 ), rtg2 D (PSY142
rtg2D::URA3), and rtg3D (PSY142 rtg3D::URA3) were used as well as WT
strain (JRY2334) and its isogenic ABF1 mutants, abf-101 (JRY4996) and
abf-102 (JRY3765).
High-throughput screening was done with WT S. cerevisiae BY4741
(MATa his3D1 leu2D0 met15D0 ura3D0) and a collection of nonessential

The growth inhibition assay was carried out as described previously (22).
Strains were grown overnight in 5 mL liquid YPD medium, and for each
strain, A600 was measured. Appropriate amount of this culture was
inoculated in 6 mL of fresh YPD medium (to have density of approximately
A600 = 0.2) and the cultures were grown at 30jC with vigorous shaking for
2 h or until the A600 = 0.45 to 0.50. Log-phase culture (25 AL) was inoculated
in 25 mL of fresh YPD medium. Five milliliter from this were dispensed in
each tube containing 0, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 mmol/L sodium arsenite. The
cultures were incubated at 30jC with vigorous shaking for 24 h. Cell
viability was done by plating appropriate dilutions on YPD agar plates, and
after 2 days at 30jC, colony-forming units in each plate were counted.
A percentage survival on different sodium arsenite concentrations was
calculated relative to untreated cultures and a graph of percentage survival
was plotted against the concentration of arsenite.

High-Throughput Screening
Before the actual screening could be done, minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of arsenic [sodium arsenite (AsIII) and sodium
arsenate (AsV)] for the WT strain (BY4741) was determined as follows:
BY4741 was inoculated in 96-well plates containing 200 AL YPD in each well.
Plates were incubated for 2 days at 30jC. Using 96-pin replicator, cultures
were spotted onto YPD plates containing varying concentrations of sodium
arsenite (1.25, 2.5, 5.0, and 10 mmol/L) or sodium arsenate (5, 10, 15, and
25 mmol/L) and plates were incubated for 3 to 6 days at 30jC. Growth of
the WT BY4741 strain on the plates containing either compound was
compared with its growth on the control plate (without any arsenite or
arsenate). The standardization experiments were repeated thrice and
MIC of sodium arsenite(III) and sodium arsenate(V) was determined as

follows: sodium arsenite(III) MIC = 5 mmol/L and sodium arsenate(V)
MIC >25 mmol/L.
Based on the MICs of arsenic obtained from the above experiments, the
concentrations to identify sensitive phenotype were determined to be
2.5 mmol/L for sodium arsenite(III) and 15 mmol/L for sodium arsenate(V).
To identify resistant phenotype of the mutant strains, concentration was
determined to be 5 mmol/L for sodium arsenite(III) and 30 mmol/L for
sodium arsenate(V).
For high-throughput analysis of sensitivity to arsenic, the collection of
deletion mutants was prepared as follows: 466 strains (showing growth
defects on nonfermentable carbon substrate) were isolated from the entire
collection of haploid deletion strains by picking up small portion of growth
from the solid agar in 96-well microtiter plates and inoculating in another
96-well microtiter plate containing 200 AL fresh sterile YPD liquid medium.
Each plate in its first column contained the WT BY4741, so each plate had
a total of 88 mutants. The plates (in triplicates) were then incubated for
48 h at 30jC. After incubation, one set was used for the screening and the
other two sets were stored as frozen glycerol stock (with addition of glycerol
in 15% final concentration). Screening was done by spotting the cultures
(using 96-pin replicator) onto YPD plates containing either sodium arsenite
(2.5 or 5 mmol/L) or sodium arsenate (15 or 30 mmol/L) as well as on YPD
plates without any arsenic (control plates). Plates were incubated for 4 to
15 days at 30jC and phenotype of each mutant was scored as sensitive or
resistant compared with control plate and internal control (BY4741 on each
plate). Each experiment was done thrice independently.

Data Analysis
Categorization of genes based on the biological functions. The
deletion mutants that showed arsenic-sensitive phenotype were categorized
based on the biological functions of the genes. The information on
the biological functions for each of these genes was obtained from
Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD)1 and Comprehensive Yeast
Genome Database (CYGD).2

Interaction analysis of the genes using PathwayAssist software. The
deletion mutants were analyzed using PathwayAssist software (version 3.0;
Stratagene Corp.) at the Gene Expression Facility of Roswell Park Cancer
Institute. Three different types of interactions that were included in the
analysis are as follows: direct interactions between the proteins, common
regulators for the genes of interest, and common targets of the genes of
interest.
Human orthologues to yeast genes. Human orthologues to the
identified yeast genes were determined using National Center for
Biotechnology Information HomoloGene database.

Results
mtDNA-depleted yeast cells (rho°) show higher sensitivity to
sodium arsenite. It has been shown that mitochondria are direct
target of arsenic-induced toxicity in mammalian cells (12, 13,
23, 24). As the first step in identifying mitochondrial processes
involved in arsenic-induced toxicity, we used S. cerevisiae strains
defective in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. To show
that mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is involved in
arsenic-induced toxicity in yeast, we tested arsenite sensitivity of
WT and its isogenic derivative rhoj cells lacking the entire mtDNA
as described in Materials and Methods.
Figure 1 shows the percentage survival for WT and rhoj strain at
different concentrations of sodium arsenite after 24-h exposure. At
0.25 mmol/L sodium arsenite, rhoj cells showed significantly
higher sensitivity than WT strain (25% survival versus 90% survival
of the WT). At 0.50 mmol/L sodium arsenite, that difference was
less exaggerated (10% survival of rhoj cells versus 25% for WT),
whereas at the highest concentration of 0.75 mmol/L sodium
arsenite, growth of both strains was completely inhibited. These
data clearly suggest an important role for mitochondrial function
in response to arsenic.

processes involved in response to arsenic, we screened for arsenic

and (no growth). WT strain was inoculated in the first column of
each plate, which served as an internal control in the case of both
arsenite and arsenate, and screening was repeated thrice. Scores
from all three screens were consolidated and only strains that
showed consistent sensitive phenotype in all three screens are
included in the final list of sensitive mutants (Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2). Under these conditions, screen identified 72
arsenite-sensitive and 81 arsenate-sensitive mutants (Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2). All identified sensitive mutants were rescreened
twice to confirm their sensitivity to arsenite and arsenate.
Identified sensitive mutants belong to different biological
functions. The arsenite- and arsenate-sensitive mutants identified
were classified based on their biological functions. This categorization was done using information from yeast databases SGD
and CYGD. Identified genes were found to be involved in diverse
cellular functions, such as signal transduction/protein modification, transcription, metabolism, transport, vacuolar processes,
oxidative stress, cell cycle, and various other processes important
in maintaining the proper mitochondrial function (Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2).
Of all the mutants identified as sensitive in both arsenite and
arsenate screens, close to 20% were defective in transcription, 11%
mutants were defective in signal transduction/protein modification, and <5% were involved in both oxidative stress and cell

cycle. About 13% of the mutants were defective in metabolic
pathways, including ergosterol biosynthesis, ubiquinone metabolism, and protein synthesis. Majority of the mutants identified in
the screens belonged to the functional group of vacuolar process,
which made up f30% of the sensitive mutants. The genes under
this category encoded for subunits of vacuolar ATPases or were
involved in vacuolar protein sorting. Almost 16% of mutants
identified were defective in other processes involved in mitochondrial function (Fig. 2A and B).
Of all mutants that were screened, 61 mutants were found to be
sensitive to both arsenite and arsenate (Supplementary Table S3).
It is likely that large numbers of common mutants between
arsenate and arsenite are due to the fact that arsenate is converted
to arsenite during metabolism in yeast (25). Genes that were
unique to arsenite or arsenate sensitivity are listed in Supplementary Tables S4 and S5, respectively.
Cellular interaction analysis of the identified genes. All the
genes whose inactivation led to arsenic sensitivity were analyzed
for various cellular interactions. Using PathwayAssist software,
three different kinds of cellular interactions were analyzed. These
include common regulators, common targets, and direct interactions between identified genes. This analysis provides an approach
to compare different kinds of cellular interactions, including
protein-protein interactions as well as genetic interactions. Genes

that did not show any interactions were excluded from the analysis.
It is noteworthy that absence of interaction does not mean that
these genes do not play a role in arsenic toxicity.
Analysis of common transcriptional regulators showed that 25
arsenite-responsive and 32 arsenate-responsive genes were regulated by common transcriptional regulators (Figs. 3A and 4A).
These transcriptional regulators include RTG3, ABF1, SMP1, REB1,
LEU3, HAP5, MCM1, and NDD1. The ‘‘common targets’’ analysis
yielded targets of two or more genes found in our screen. These
targets were shown to regulate cellular processes and transcription
of other transcription factors (Figs. 3B and 4B). The ‘‘direct interactions’’ analysis yielded a network of direct and multiple interactions between the genes identified in our screen. Direct
interactions between 40 of 72 arsenite-responsive genes and 56 of
81 arsenate-responsive genes were observed (Figs. 3C and 4C). The
type of interactions that were observed included direct binding
interactions, genetic interactions, expression, protein modification,
and regulation.
Effect of sodium arsenite on mutants defective in mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde response. Above interaction
analysis showed RTG3 as one of the common transcriptional
regulators involved in arsenic response. Interestingly, Rtg3p is
involved in mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde response. In
addition, our arsenite sensitivity assay of cells depleted for mtDNA
(rhoj cells) showed their increased sensitivity (Fig. 1). It is noteworthy that the mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling
pathway is activated in cells lacking mtDNA and this signaling is
controlled by Rtg3p along with Rtg1p and Rtg2p (26). We therefore
asked whether genes involved in mitochondria-to-nucleus response
pathway also play a role in arsenic sensitivity. For this purpose, we
measured percentage survival of rtg1, rtg2, and rtg3 null mutant
strains as well as their isogenic WT strain (Fig. 5A).
Indeed, rtg3D mutant shows dose-dependent sensitivity. Interestingly, rtg2D mutant shows complete growth inhibition. In
contrast to rtg2 and rtg3, rtg1D mutant shows resistance. Together,
these data suggest that different components of the retrograde
signaling pathway play different roles in the response of the cell
to arsenic: whereas Rtg2 and Rtg3 seem to be involved in
protection from arsenic exposure, Rtg1 seems to sensitize cells to
arsenic.
Arsenic sensitivity of ABF1 null mutants. In addition to RTG3,
our interaction analyses identified ABF1 gene as a key regulator
of arsenic response. ABF1 is an essential regulatory factor that
contributes to transcriptional activation of a large number of
genes involved in multiple functions, including silencing and
replication. We tested the sensitivity of two mutant alleles of
ABF1, abf-101 and abf-102, to sodium arsenite. As described
previously, cultures of both mutants as well as their corresponding
isogenic WT strains were exposed to various concentrations of
sodium arsenite for 24 h followed by plating on YPD medium for
colony count. Percentage of survival was calculated relative to
untreated control. Interestingly, whereas abf-101 mutant shows
greater sensitivity to sodium arsenite than its corresponding WT,
abf-102 mutant shows resistance to same concentrations of
sodium arsenite (Fig. 5B).
Human orthologues of identified yeast genes. One of the
major goals of using yeast as a model system in this study was to
identify human orthologues to the yeast genes that may play a role
in arsenic response. Our search for human orthologues identified
32 proteins in arsenite-sensitive category and 40 human orthologues in the arsenate-sensitive category (Supplementary Tables S6

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

and S7; Fig. 6). Five human orthologues were to genes that are
uniquely sensitive to arsenite, 13 were to genes uniquely sensitive
to arsenate, and 27 of them overlapped in both cases. Human
orthologues were found to belong to category of transcription
factors, signal transduction, oxidative stress, metabolism, vacuolar
processes, and transport processes. However, to confirm biological
significance of this analysis, selected genes need to be analyzed
using small interfering RNA system in cell culture to silence their
expression and subsequently analyze their sensitivity to arsenite or
arsenate as well as any other phenotypic changes. This experimental approach will potentially give valuable insight in genes and
pathways responsible for protecting human cells against arsenic
toxicity.

Discussion
Arsenic is considered a ‘‘paradoxical’’ carcinogen as it can induce
tumors in humans but not in any other animal model (2). The
mechanism of human carcinogenicity remains unclear. Recent
study described mitochondria as an important target for arsenicinduced carcinogenicity (27). Using yeast as a model system, we
show that cells defective in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
and other mitochondrial functions show significantly greater
sensitivity to arsenic. This suggests that mitochondrial function
plays an important role in protecting cells against arsenic and that
impaired OXPHOS leads to arsenic sensitivity.
We analyzed the effect of arsenite and arsenate on null mutants
deleted in nuclear genes involved in a variety of mitochondrial
functions. After determining the MIC for sodium arsenite and
sodium arsenate (5 and >25 mmol/L, respectively), high-throughput
screen of 466 such null mutants defective in mitochondrial
function yielded a set of mutants sensitive to both arsenite and
arsenate. Identified arsenite- and arsenate-responsive genes belong
to various functional classes, including transcription, signal
transduction/protein modification, oxidative stress, cell cycle,
metabolism, and cellular transport. Among the arsenite-sensitive
genes, 61 exhibited cross-sensitivity to arsenate, which indicates
that the remaining unique genes in each case may play various
roles in protecting yeast against arsenic-induced toxicity. Commonality of large number of genes can be accounted for from the
fact that arsenate is reduced to arsenite in the metabolic pathway
(28). It also suggests existence of common pathways involved in
protecting cells against arsenite- and arsenate-induced toxicity.
Genes whose deletion leads to both arsenite and arsenate
sensitivity. Various genes identified encoded for proteins belonging to a network of transcription factors, such as SWI/SNF
complexes. SWI3 and SNF6 identified in our screen are global
transcription activators. They form a subunit of the SWI/SNF
chromatin remodeling complex that regulates transcription of
many important genes (29–31). SWI6 is a transcription cofactor,
which regulates transcription at G1-S transition by formation of
complexes with DNA-binding proteins Swi4p and Mbp1p (32).
SRB8 is a subunit of RNA polymerase II mediator complex and is
essential for transcriptional regulation (33). Mutants defective in
these transcription factors showed sensitivity to arsenic, which
suggests that these genes regulate the transcription of various
genes that protect cells from arsenic.
Signal transduction/protein modification also seems to be
affected by arsenic. SNF1 and SNF4 are a part of protein kinase
and are required for glucose repression in yeast (34). Deletion of
these genes has been known to have pleiotropic effects on cell cycle

Mitochondrial Response to Arsenic

and cellular energetic (35). These deletion strains showed
sensitivity to arsenic, implying their role in arsenic toxicity.
Arsenic increases oxidative stress in the cell (36). Deletion of
genes involved in protection of the cell against oxidative stress will
increase vulnerability of cells to oxidative damage. We identified
two such genes (i.e., SOD2 and GRX5). SOD2 is a mitochondrial
superoxide dismutase that protects the cell from oxidative stress
(37). GRX5 is a mitochondrial glutaredoxin and is essential for
the activity of iron/sulfur centers (38). Cells deleted in GRX5 are
constantly subjected to oxidative damage and this effect is severed
in the presence of oxidant (38). Identification of SOD2 and GRX5
null mutants sensitive to arsenite and arsenate implies that oxidative stress plays an important role in arsenic-induced cell death.
Genes from various other pathways, such as cell cycle (PAC13
and SPS2) ergosterol biosynthesis (ERG2 and ERG3), heme
synthesis (HEM14), amino acid synthesis (AAT2), ubiquinone
biosynthesis (COQ2 and COQ6), and protein degradation (DOA4),
also seem to contribute to arsenic sensitivity when deleted. The
largest groups of mutant were found to belong to proteins involved
in vacuolar processes.
The genes included in the functional group of vacuolar processes
encoded for various subunits of the vacuolar H+-ATPase and
proteins involved in vacuolar protein sorting. Vacuolar H+-ATPase
hydrolyses cytosolic ATP and transports protons across the
membrane. This movement leads to generation of electrochemical
gradient that acidifies the interior of a vacuole (39). In yeast,
vacuolar acidification is involved in secondary transport of variety
of ions and metabolites (40). It is known that arsenic is removed
from the cells via sequestration of As(GS)3 into vacuoles (28).

(A) and abf-101 and abf-102 mutants (B ) to arsenite. Cultures of rtg1, rtg2 ,
and rtg3 mutants as well as isogenic WT strain (A) or abf-101 and abf-102
mutants and their isogenic WT (B) were exposed to various concentrations of
sodium arsenite for 24 h and cell viability was measured by colony count on YPD
plates. Percentage survival of all strains is expressed relative to untreated
control. Data are an average of three independent experiments.

Figure 6. Human orthologues of identified yeast genes. Venn diagram
showing number of human orthologues to yeast genes whose deletion leads to
sensitivity to arsenite or arsenate or both.

Mutants that are defective in vacuolar H+-ATPases may not be able
to carry out acidification of the vacuoles and might therefore not
allow for sequestration of As(GS)3 into the vacuoles. This would
essentially lead to accumulation of arsenic in the cell leading to cell
death. Another process that was affected in response to arsenic was
vacuolar protein sorting. Proteins synthesized on the endoplasmic
reticulum in the cytosol are transported to Golgi complex and then
directed to various organelles. The distribution of proteins to their
destination is carried out by set of proteins called sorting proteins
(39). In our screen, mutants lacking these genes are defective in
vacuolar sorting function, which may result in loss of transport of
proteins to the mitochondria, leading to improper functioning of
mitochondria. The fact that these mutants are sensitive to arsenic
suggests that proper functioning of mitochondria is necessary for
the cells to nullify the toxic effects of arsenic.
Genes whose deletion leads to sensitivity exclusively to
arsenite or arsenate. Many of the mutants were found to be
uniquely sensitive to either arsenite or arsenate. This exhibition of
specific sensitivity to valence state of the arsenic implies that cells
have distinct pathways of protection against effects of arsenite and
arsenate.
Arsenite-specific sensitivity. MTM1 is a gene involved in
activation of mitochondrial Sod2p (41). Deletion of this gene results
in sensitivity specifically to arsenite. PHO80 encodes for a cyclin
that forms a cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complex with Pho85p
and phosphorylates Pho4p-Swi5p, which in turn activates transcription of genes expressed in G1 phase and G1-M boundary (42).
SSD1 gene functions in maintaining the cell wall integrity and
deletion of this gene alters the composition and cell wall architecture of the yeast cell surface (43). Detection of these genes suggests
that oxidative stress, cell wall integrity, and cell cycle phase are important components in determining the sensitivity of the cells to arsenic.
Arsenate-specific sensitivity. Unlike arsenite, arsenate-specific
sensitivity was shown by mutants deleted in genes involved in
transcription, signal transduction, lipid metabolism, protein
synthesis, and vacuolar processes. Some of them are described as
follows. RNR4 encodes for a subunit of RNR complex that catalyzes
the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides (44). SNF2
encodes for catalytic subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling

complex (45). CRD1 is a cardiolipin synthase involved in production
of cardiolipin, an important constituent of mitochondrial membrane, which is required for maintaining the mitochondrial
membrane potential and function (46). PHO85 is a cyclin-dependent
protein kinase, which plays a role in the metabolism of phosphate
and glycogen and influences progress of the cell cycle (47).
Cellular interactions involved in arsenic response. Using
PathwayAssist software cellular interaction analysis software,
we identified multiple genes whose deletion resulted in arsenicsensitive phenotype. Among transcriptional regulators, we identified
Rtg3p as a common regulator of arsenic response. Rtg3p, together
with Rtg1p and Rtg2p, monitors the functional state of mitochondria
and are described as the regulators of mitochondria-to-nucleus
response. To date, no known human homologues of Rtg proteins
have been identified; however, mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde
response pathway is conserved across the species. Because mitochondria are an important target of arsenic-induced toxicity (27),
we determined whether all three proteins involved in mitochondriato-nucleus retrograde response were involved in arsenic-induced
cellular response. Our results suggest that RTG2 and RTG3 genes
play a key role in protecting cells from toxic effects of arsenic. Surprisingly, our study revealed that RTG1 has distinctly different function
as null mutation in RTG1 gene results in resistance to arsenite.
Beside RTG3, we identified other common regulators. This
includes ABF1, a DNA-binding protein that is involved in transcriptional activation, gene silencing, and DNA replication and
repair (48). ABF1 regulates the expression of at least 10 genes that
were involved in different processes, including ergosterol metabolism and vacuolar protein sorting. Indeed, our experiment
revealed (Fig. 5B) that ABF1 gene is involved in arsenic response.
Another gene, REB1, a DNA-binding protein that binds to genes
transcribed by both RNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase II (49),
regulates the expression of proteins involved in vacuolar acidification and protein sorting. The fact that the handful of genes
whose deletion causes sensitivity to arsenic are commonly
regulated suggests that these regulators may play an important
role in the response of the cells to arsenic. It also suggests that
mutation in the genes encoding the common regulator may lead
to altered expression of the subsequent genes affecting the ability
of the cells to deal with arsenic in its environment.
Many common targets of the arsenic-responsive genes suggest
that deletion of these genes leads to altered expression of the target
genes, which in turn renders the cells sensitive to arsenic. The
common targets are regulated by more than one gene and could
suggest that the target genes may have essential functions and may
signify redundancy of the regulating genes. Direct interactions
analysis between genes of our interest suggested that they form a
part of a complex regulatory network and alteration of any one
may affect expression of various other genes that directly or
indirectly interact with it. This altered expression may account for
the sensitivity of the cells to arsenic in our screen, implying that
all these genes work in tandem with each other to protect the cells
against arsenic.

Human orthologues to arsenic-responsive yeast genes.
One of the goals of our study was to identify the possible
pathways of arsenic toxicity in humans. Our search in the
HomoloGene database revealed several human orthologues to the
identified yeast genes whose deletion causes sensitivity to arsenite
and arsenate. These include genes involved in transcription,
signal transduction, oxidative stress, metabolism, and vacuolar
processes.
Human orthologue of yeast gene RNR4 is RRM2, which encodes
for M2 subunit of enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RR). The
activity of this enzyme depends on the synthesis of M2 subunit,
which is controlled in cell cycle–dependent fashion (50). RR plays
a key role in DNA synthesis and is responsible for maintaining the
deoxynucleotide triphosphate pool for DNA synthesis and repair.
It may be hypothesized that decrease in activity of RR due to
deletion or mutation of RRM2 may affect the DNA synthesis and
repair ability of the cells. In addition, it is known that p53
regulates RR by interaction with p53R2 and RRM2 in humans (51).
Sensitivity of yeast rnr4 null mutant to arsenate suggests that
inactivation of RRM2 gene in human cells should result in arsenicsensitive phenotype. People with RRM2 polymorphic variant may
have suboptimal RR activity and may be susceptible to arsenicinduced carcinogenesis and other diseases.
Among many other yeast gene that has a human orthologue is
SOD2, a mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2. Superoxide
dismutase converts superoxide byproducts from the OXPHOS
chain to hydrogen peroxide and diatomic oxygen. SOD2 in humans
has been implicated to play a role in cancer (52, 53). As previously
described, arsenic has been known to increase oxidative stress in
the cells and alteration in the antioxidant SOD2 gene can lead to
sensitivity to arsenic, which points toward the involvement of
SOD2 in the mechanism of arsenic-induced carcinogenesis in
humans.
Identification of multiple homologues belonging to diverse
functional groups indicates that several biological processes are
involved in protecting the human cells against arsenic-induced
toxicity. Our mitochondria-wide screen of genes in yeast indicates
that human cells use multiple pathways to protect cells against
arsenic-induced cell death.
In conclusion, we identified various processes involved in
response to arsenic in yeast, some of which have been described
in arsenic carcinogenesis in humans. Human orthologues to these
identified genes in yeast may serve as an important tool to
investigate the mechanisms of arsenic carcinogenesis in humans.
