Abstract
Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are critical regulators of prostate
tumor cell growth. In this report, we offer evidence that a critical support of IGF-I in prostate cancer is
mediated by its ability to suppress BMP4-induced apoptosis and Smad-mediated gene expression. Suppression
of BMP4 signaling by IGF-I was reversed by chemical inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, or
mTOR; by enforced expression of wild-type PTEN or dominant-negative PI3K; or by small hairpin RNA–
mediated silencing of mTORC1/2 subunits Raptor or Rictor. Similarly, IGF-I suppressed BMP4-induced
transcription of the Id1, Id2, and Id3 genes that are crucially involved in prostate tumor progression through
PI3K-dependent and mTORC1/2-dependent mechanisms. Immunohistochemical analysis of non-malignant
and malignant prostate tissues offered in vivo support for our model that IGF-I–mediated activation of mTOR
suppresses phosphorylation of the BMP-activated Smad transcription factors. Our results offer the first
evidence that IGF-I signaling through mTORC1/2 is a key homeostatic regulator of BMP4 function in prostate
epithelial cells, acting at two levels to repress both the proapoptotic and pro-oncogenic signals of BMPactivated Smads. We suggest that deregulation of this homeostatic control may be pivotal to the development
and progression of prostate cancer, providing important implications and new potential targets for the therapeutic intervention of this malignancy. Cancer Res; 70(22); 9106–17. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are multifunctional
cytokines belonging to the transforming growth factor
(TGF)-β superfamily that play critical roles in osteogenesis, organogenesis, and embryogenesis, in which they control cell
differentiation, proliferation, migration, and apoptosis (1–6).
BMP signaling is initiated by the association of a BMP ligand
(any 1 of ≥14 isoforms) with two transmembrane serine/
threonine receptor kinases: BMP receptors II and I (typically
BMP receptors IA and IB), the latter of which directly phosphorylate the transcription factors Smads 1, 5, and 8 (1–6).
The phosphorylated Smads then couple to Smad4 and translocate to the nucleus, where they modulate the transcription

of numerous genes in part by binding to BMP response
elements. Whereas BMPs function as tumor suppressors in
early-stage prostate cancer, they are reported to also promote
progression of advanced/hormone refractory prostate cancer
(7–9). However, the mechanisms underlying this functional
dichotomy are poorly understood but likely involve the
combined action of multiple gene changes.
Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I is a well-known survival
factor for both normal and malignant cells in many tissues,
including the prostate (10, 11), although IGF-I has been
shown to also be critical in controlling the differentiation
of many tissues through mechanisms that remain underexplored (12–15). The survival function of IGF-I seems to
be predominantly through a signal transduction cascade involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR; refs. 11, 16, 17). Numerous studies collectively suggest that enhanced IGF-I signaling is critical for the development and progression of prostate cancer
(11). Importantly, correlative studies have linked high plasma
IGF-I levels and prostate cancer risk (18). Moreover, transgenic mice overexpressing IGF-I in the prostate basal epithelial layer develop prostate cancer (19), strongly implicating
high IGF-I levels in the etiology of prostate cancer. Significantly, functional loss of PTEN, which induces the development of prostate cancer in knockout mice, leads to activation
of Akt, a critical component of the survival and oncogenic
function of IGF-I (11, 20).

IGF-I Suppresses Bone Morphogenetic Protein Responses

Recent studies show that IGF-I can inhibit TGF-β transcriptional activity by selective suppression of Smad3 activation
through a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism (21). Further work
has implicated mTOR in such regulation (22); however, the
mechanism of how mTOR intercepts TGF-β signaling remains
to be defined. With the use of rat and human prostate epithelial cell lines, we provide the first evidence that IGF-I suppresses BMP4-induced cell death; activation of Smads 1, 5,
and/or 8; as well as induced expression of BMP4 target genes
through a mechanism dependent on the PI3K, Akt, mTOR,
Raptor, and Rictor signaling pathway. Particularly intriguing
is our observation that this IGF-I signaling pathway clearly
represses the ability of BMP4 to induce expression of inhibitor
of differentiation/DNA binding (Id)1, Id2, and Id3, proteins
whose overexpression promotes growth and progression of
prostate cancer (23–25). Our results support that the ability
of mTOR to repress BMP signaling is part of an important
homeostatic switch that is deregulated in prostate cancer.

prostate of the Lobund/Wistar rat are exquisitely sensitive to
the induction of apoptosis by TGF-β (29). We examined the
general responsiveness of NRP-152 cells versus a metastasisderived PTEN-null human prostate cell line, PC3, to various
members of the TGF-β superfamily [TGF-β1, activins (A, B,
or AB), BMP4, Müllerian inhibiting substance, Nodal, or
Cripto] by their ability to phosphorylate various Smads, as
assessed by Western blot with the use of various phosphoSmad antibodies (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1). Due to lack
of complete isoform specificity of the antibodies available for
phospho-Smads 1, 3, 5, and 8, we used an anti-phosphoSmad1/5/3/8 (antibody 1), which recognizes two specific

bands [phospho-Smads 1, 5, and 8 (top), and phospho-Smad3
(bottom)], and an anti–phospho-Smad1/5/8 specific antibody (antibody 2; Fig. 1A). In both cell lines TGF-β1 and
activin B specifically activated Smads 2 and 3, but not
Smads 1, 5, or 8; and BMP4 specifically activated Smads
1, 5, and/or 8 (for simplicity, designated Smad1/5/8), but
not Smads 2 or 3. We were unable to detect activation of
Smads by Müllerian inhibiting substance, Nodal, or Cripto
in either cell line under these conditions. NRP-152 and
PC3 cells are thus the most sensitive to TGF-β1 and
BMP4 (at the indicated concentrations) among the TGF-β
superfamily ligands examined.

and analyzed for Smad activation by Western blot with the use of antibodies against the two c-terminal serines of phospho-Smads 1, 3, 5, 8 (Ab #1),
phospho-Smad1/5/8 (Ab #2), and phospho-Smad2. B, NRP-152, DP-153, LNCaP, PC3, and DU145 cells treated with BMP4 (0-20 ng/mL) for 72 hours,

IGF-I Suppresses Bone Morphogenetic Protein Responses

BMP4 seems to be more cytostatic on premalignant or earlystage prostate cancer cells than on late-stage ones.
IGF-I reverses growth suppression of prostate
epithelial cells by BMP4
Based on various published reports and our results in
Fig. 1B, we speculated that the cytostatic activity of BMP4
was lost during prostate carcinogenesis by the activation of

IGF-I signaling, similar to our previous report on the repression of TGF-β responses by IGF-I (21). In a time course
experiment during which 72 hours of BMP4 (10 ng/mL) treatment caused a 65% loss in NRP-152 cell number (Fig. 2A),
such cell death was effectively repressed by pretreatment
with 2 to 10 nmol/L LR3–IGF-I (Fig. 2B), an analogue that
shares similar affinity to the IGF-I receptor but is essentially
unable to bind to IGF-I binding proteins.

Figure 3. LR3–IGF-I abrogates BMP4-induced activation of Smad1/5/8, and Id1, Id2, and Id3 expression. A, NRP-152 cells were treated with ± LR3–IGF-I

cotransfected with 25 ng of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-renilla reporter construct and 1 μg of Id1-luciferase reporter element 24 hours before ± LR3–IGF-I

IGF-I Suppresses Bone Morphogenetic Protein Responses

We next characterized the ability of LR3–IGF-I to suppress
the cytostatic activity of BMP4 on NRP-152 cells by measuring changes in apoptosis using three different assays
(Fig. 2C). In the first method, NRP-152 cells were pretreated
with ± LR3–IGF-I (10 nmol/L) for 24 hours followed by ±
BMP4 (5 ng/mL) for 24 to 72 hours, and apoptosis was identified by nuclear condensation and fragmentation under fluorescent (white arrows) microscopy following Hoechst 33258
staining (Fig. 2C, left; Supplementary Fig. S2). BMP4 caused
markedly increased numbers of apoptotic nuclei (∼40% of
cells) over control, whereas cells pretreated with LR3–IGF-I
were significantly blocked in BMP4-induced apoptosis
(∼8% of cells). These results were consistent with changes
in cell viability (trypan blue exclusion) and apoptotic fraction
(sub-G1 by flow cytometric analysis) at 72 hours (Fig. 2C,
middle, right). The sub-G1 fraction of the cells showed that
BMP4 induced apoptosis in ∼11% of the cells compared with
vehicle control (∼4%). LR3–IGF-I treatment brought the
percent sub-G1 fraction in each group to equal to or less than
that of vehicle only (∼3%). There was no significant change
in the fraction of cells in G1, but there was an increase in the
fraction in G2-M (Supplementary Fig. S3). Together, these
studies confirm LR3–IGF-I effectively blocks the ability of
BMP4 to induce apoptosis of NRP-152 cells.
We also examined the effect of LR3–IGF-I on the cytostatic
effect of BMP4 in other prostate cell lines, including LNCaP,
PC3, RWPE-1, VCaP, and DP-153 cells. LR3–IGF-I reversed
the ability of BMP4 to suppress growth or induce cell death,
as shown morphologically and by enumerating cells with the
use of a Coulter counter (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S4).
These results support the universality of IGF-I receptor
signaling on reversing the cytostatic activity of BMP4 on
prostate epithelial cells.
Effect of IGF-I on activation of Smads by BMP4
To explore the mechanism by which IGF-I intercepts BMP
signaling, we assessed the ability of LR3–IGF-I to affect BMP4induced activation of Smad1/5/8 in NRP-152 cells (Fig. 3A).
We pretreated these cells with ± LR3–IGF-I (2 or 10 nmol/L)
or insulin (1 μmol/L) for 24 hours, stimulated them with
BMP4 (10 ng/mL) for 4 hours, and then analyzed levels of
phospho-Smad1/5/8 by Western blot as in Supplementary
Fig. S5. NRP-152 cells treated with BMP4 showed robust activation of Smad1/5/8, which was suppressed by 10 nmol/L
LR3–IGF-I or 1 μmol/L insulin. Similar results were observed
in RWPE-1 and DU-145 human prostate epithelial cell lines
(Fig. 3C). To define how rapidly IGF-I suppresses BMP4induced activation of Smad1/5/8, we pretreated NRP-152
cells with LR3–IGF-I for various times before 4 hours of
treatment with BMP4 (Fig. 3A). Phosphorylation of
Smad1/5/8 by BMP4 was suppressed as early as 1 hour pretreatment with LR3–IGF-I, with no change in levels of total
Smad1/5/8.
IGF-I represses transcriptional activation of Id1
by BMP4
Given that Id proteins are transcriptionally induced by
BMPs through Smad1/5/8, and IGF-I blocks this activation,

www.aacrjournals.org

we hypothesized that IGF-I suppresses the expression of the
helix-loop-helix Id proteins, a well-known Smad-dependent
transcriptional target of BMP (30). BMP4 rapidly (<4 h)
induced Id1 protein levels in NRP-152 cells, and such induction was significantly repressed by 1 hour of IGF-I pretreatment (Fig. 3A), reflecting the general pattern of Smad
phosphorylation. Additionally, we showed that 1-hour
pretreatment with LR3–IGF-I also reversed BMP4-induced
(5 ng/mL, 4 h) Id1 promoter activity in both NRP-152
and LNCaP cells transiently transfected with a pGL2-Id-1
promoter construct containing a number of BMP response
elements (BREs) [ref. 30; Fig. 3A (bottom); Supplementary
Fig. S6).
Semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to assess the ability of
LR3–IGF-I to suppress BMP4-induced levels of Id1, Id2, and
Id3 mRNAs in NRP-152 cells (Fig. 3B). BMP4 induced expression of all three Id mRNAs within 4, and 4-to-24 hours
of pretreatment with LR3–IGF-I suppressed such induction.
A similar response was observed in the LNCaP cell line for
Id1 mRNA (Fig. 3B). However, for reasons not clear, the
suppression of Id1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3B) was delayed relative to suppression of Id1 protein levels (Fig. 3A). Real-time
quantitative PCR confirmed our semiquantitative RT-PCR
data that IGF-I effectively blocked BMP-induced Id1 mRNA
expression (Fig. 3D). Overall, these data suggest that IGF-I
blocks BMP4-mediated expression of Id1, Id2, and Id3 in
prostate epithelial cells through a transcriptional mechanism involving suppression of the phosphorylation of
Smad1/5/8.
Role of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in mediating
IGF-I suppression of BMP responses
The PI3K/Akt pathway, which is generally hyperactivated
in prostate cancer, is believed to play a prominent role in the
survival function of IGF-I. We thus hypothesized that IGF-I
inhibits BMP responses through a PI3K-dependent mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we cotransfected NRP-152 cells
with Id1-luciferase construct along with constitutive active
PI3K (CA-PI3K), dominant-negative PI3K (DN-PI3K), or
empty vector control (pSG5), and then added ±10 nmol/L
LR 3 –IGF-I for 2 hours followed by BMP4 (5 ng/mL) for
24 hours before luciferase assay (Fig. 4A, left). As anticipated,
CA-PI3K suppressed BMP-induced Id1-luciferase reporter activity, whereas DN-PI3K reversed LR3–IGF-I inhibition of this
BMP response. A highly selective inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002,
reversed the suppressive action of LR 3 –IGF-I on BMP4induced Id1 promoter activity (Fig. 4A, right). Similar results
were obtained with the Akt inhibitor perifosine (Fig. 4B) or
the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Fig. 4C). These results
strongly suggest that the IGF-I suppression occurs downstream of Akt and mTOR.
Overall, the above results suggest that the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR mediate the ability of IGF-I to suppress the activation of Smad1/5/8 by BMP4 and, hence, activation of the
Id1 promoter. To confirm our model, we examined the
effect of LY294002, rapamycin, or perifosine on the ability
of LR3–IGF-I to suppress BMP-induced Smad activation
under conditions as in Fig. 4B and C, except that cells were

(Supplementary Fig. S7), suggesting basal levels of PI3K and
Akt suppress BMP signaling.
Silencing expression of mTOR, raptor, or rictor
reverses the ability of IGF-I to inhibit BMP signaling
We further investigated the roles of each of the two mTOR
complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2) in BMP4 signaling by
efficiently and stably silencing mTOR as well as a critical
component of mTORC1 (Raptor) and mTORC2 (Rictor)
complexes. For this we used specific small hairpin RNA interference delivered by a doxycline-inducible lentiviral transduction system, as previously described (31), which knock
down mTOR, Raptor, and Rictor in NRP-152 cells by >95%

(Fig. 5A). The stably silenced cell lines were treated with
LR3–IGF-I before BMP4 addition and analyzed as before for
levels of total and phospho-Smad1/5/8. Silencing mTOR, Raptor, or Rictor reversed the ability of IGF-I to inhibit BMP4induced phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 (Fig. 5B and C;
Supplementary Fig. S8) and the suppressive action of IGF-I
on BMP-induced Id1 promoter activity (Fig. 5D). Consistent
with these results, overexpression of mTOR, Raptor, and
Rictor in NRP-152 cells each alone suppressed BMP-induced
Id1 promoter activity (data not shown). Taken together, our
results suggest that both mTORC1 and mTORC2 play a role
critical in mediating the suppression of BMP responses by
IGF-I in prostate epithelial cells.

transfected with Id1 promoter construct 24 hours before treatment with LR3–IGF-I (10 nmol/L). After 2 hours cells were treated with BMP4 (5 ng/mL)

IGF-I represses numerous BMP-regulated genes
We examined the global effect of IGF-I on gene expression
by BMP4 in NRP-152 cells with the use of microarray analysis
with Affymetrix Rat Gene 1.0 ST Array microarrays containing

33,297 probe set IDs for known genes. The fold-change of each
treatment set was compared with vehicle control. The total
number of probe sets altered for each treatment is as follows

IGF-I Suppresses Bone Morphogenetic Protein Responses

IGF-I (503), and BMP4+IGF-I (1,583). This analysis revealed
that expression of 89 of the 235 BMP4-regulated (38%) genes
was specifically altered by IGF-I in a manner that could not be
accounted for by the effects of IGF-I alone (Supplementary
Table S1). Twenty of these genes were grouped to specific biological responses with the use of Pathway Studio 5.0 software
to determine pathway and molecular interaction analysis for
each of the identified treatment groups (Fig. 6A). These data
suggest that IGF-I represses the ability of BMP to modulate the
expression of a number of genes involved in tumor growth as
well as tumor suppression.
Hyperactivation of mTOR in human prostate cancer
correlates with loss of phospho-Smad1/5/8 expression
To test our hypothesis that hyperactivation of mTOR
represses the ability of BMP to phosphorylate Smad1/5/8,
we conducted an immunohistochemical analysis of phosphoSmad1/5/8 and a key downstream target or mTOR (phosphoS6) with the use of matched cores from a human prostate
tissue microarray (PR8011 series) obtained from US BioMax,
Inc. (Fig. 6B). The H-score [percent positive stained cells ×
intensity of staining (0-3)] of 34 cores representative of localized prostate adenocarcinoma (27 stages II-IV) and 7 normal
hyperplasia yielded a statistically significant inverse correlation between the levels of phospho-Smad1/5/8 and that of
phospho-S6 (R2 = 0.4271; P < 0.0001; Fig. 6C). This represents
a significant in vivo test of our model that activation of mTOR
reverses the activation of Smad1/5/8 by BMP.

Discussion
Here we report the first evidence that IGF-I signaling
through a PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway intercepts BMP responses by suppressing the c-terminal phosphorylation of
Smad1/5/8. Silencing either Raptor or Rictor alone reversed
this IGF-I repression, indicating critical and nonredundant
roles for mTORC1 and mTORC2 (32, 33) in such regulation,
the mechanism of which awaits further investigation.
BMPs are recognized to have both tumor-suppressor and
tumor-promoting functions in the prostate, although the
mechanisms mediating such opposing functions remain poorly
defined (34, 35). Whereas various BMPs have been detected in
both normal and tumor prostate tissues, BMP4 seems to be a
predominant form expressed in the normal prostate relative to
tumor tissue (ref. 36; Supplementary Fig. S9), in which it is
shown to function as a repressor of prostate ductal budding
and branching morphogenesis (37). Evidence also support
that response to BMPs is altered during prostate tumor
development/progression (38). Consistent with this, BMP4 induces the apoptosis of nontumorigenic prostate epithelial cell
lines (NRP-152 and DP-153), more so than tumorigenic ones
(LNCaP, PC3; Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S4), correlating with
the PTEN-negative status of the latter cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis reveals that phospho-Smad1/5/8 is
high in hyperplastic prostate tissues but lost in advanced
localized prostate cancer, correlating with activation of mTOR
or phospho-S6 (Fig. 6C), consistent with our in vitro data.

www.aacrjournals.org

Functional loss of PTEN, which promotes hyperactivation
of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, is well accepted to be involved in the development and progression of the majority
of prostate cancers (39) but through an incompletely understood mechanism. Our data suggest that PI3K/Akt/mTOR
plays an important role in loss of the tumor-suppressive
function of BMP4 (apoptosis/growth arrest) in prostate
cancer. Microarray expression profiling showed that IGF-I represses BMP4 to regulate expression of ∼38% of the BMP4
target genes; at least two of these BMP4-inducible ones
(IGF-BP5 and Gadd45α; Fig. 6A) have been shown to be
associated with the control of apoptosis and growth arrest
(40, 41). Thus, the oncogenic function of PI3K/Akt/mTOR
may partly occur through intercepting the cytostatic functions BMP4 (through suppressing activation of Smad1/5/8;
ref. 42). However, IGF-I/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway also represses the induction of Id1, Id3, and other tumor-promoting
proteins (Figs. 5 and 6; Supplementary Fig. S10), suggesting
this pathway also maintains homeostasis by repressing
the oncogenic functions of BMP4. Thus, Ids and other oncogenic mediators of BMP are potential new cotargets of
mTOR therapeutics.
Prostate cancer cells typically progress from a state of
androgen dependence toward that of hormone independence
(castrate resistance) through mechanisms under rigorous
investigation (43, 44). Whereas advanced prostate cancer
cells are resistant to androgens, recent studies suggest they
are dependent on the androgen receptor, which is considered
to become constitutively activated during tumor progression
(39, 45). A number of models have been proposed for the
mechanisms by which androgen receptor signaling is activated in the absence of exogenous androgens (46). Recently,
BMP receptor signaling has been reported to suppress
androgen receptor activity through a Smad1-dependent and
mitogen-activated protein kinase–dependent mechanism
involving the phosphorylation of the middle linker of Smad1
(35). The modified Smad1 then associates with the androgen
receptor and suppresses gene transcription by the androgen
receptor. Through this mechanism, basal levels of autocrine
BMP activity (47) may help maintain the androgen-dependent
phenotype of prostate tumors. Akt/mTOR signaling can
significantly enhance androgen receptor activity, thus
promoting “androgen independence” through mechanisms
that are not clear (48). Our findings suggest that this may
occur through reversing the suppressive activity of the
BMP/Smad1/5/8 pathway on the androgen receptor. On the
other hand, enhanced androgen receptor activity has been
shown to activate mTOR (49), and results from our current
study suggest that the suppressive activity of mTOR on
BMP may serve to further enhance the activity of the androgen receptor. This positive feedback/signal amplification loop
is likely to contribute to castration-resistant prostate cancer.
In the normal or preneoplastic prostate tissue, this positive
feedback loop is likely to be kept in check through the induction of BMP7 and BMP receptor II by androgens (47, 50).
Taken together, our study here provides further insight on
the potential mechanism by which prostate cancer cells progress toward androgen independence, with the ultimate goal of
