to target this signaling molecule to improve cancer therapy. Activation, or
signaling mechanism. Signal 1 requires tumor-associated antigen recognition by
the T-cell receptor, while signal 2 occurs through binding of CD80 or CD86 (B7.1
of 2) on the antigen presenting cell (APC) with CD28 on the T cell. Importantly,
there is a final step responsible for naturally occurring immune regulation; this
occurs in response to competitive binding of CD80/CD86 on the APC by CTLA-4
on the T cell. This ‘immune checkpoint’ interrupts signal 2 and inhibits the activated T cell. Targeting CTLA-4 as an anticancer strategy: Following proof-of-concept studies in animals, fully human anti-CTLA-4 antibodies were developed and

promising antitumor activity, initially in patients with advanced melanoma.
Class-specific immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were common and mostly
transient and/or manageable. These events are thought to be mechanism-ofaction-related, indicating immune tolerance is broken; this relation may also
explain the association between irAEs and response seen in several trials. Interruption of immune inhibitory pathways via CTLA-4 blockade appears to be a
promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy. Cancer 2007;110:2614–27.  2007

T

he recent science-led increase in the development of immune
strategies for cancer treatment has generated excitement and
hope in the oncology community. Cancer immunotherapy attempts
to either modulate the host’s tumor-directed immune response, produce a novel antitumor immune reaction, or, in the case of adoptive
immunotherapy, provide the patient with active antitumor immune
effector cells. Modulating the host’s immune response can be
achieved by a variety of means, such as enhancement of functional
tumor immunogenicity by overcoming immunoregulatory mechanisms which ‘dampen’ responses to tumor-associated antigens. One
promising approach involves augmenting endogenous T-cellmediated immunity by interrupting the T-cell down-regulatory pathways that contribute to immune tolerance, thereby boosting signaling and enhancing activation. The advantage of this approach is

that targeting the host’s immune system removes the
need to identify specific tumor antigens, providing 1
target instead of many, while still generating a tumor-specific immune response.
The discovery of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4; CD152) and its role as a key negative regulator in immune activity has prompted
efforts to target this signaling molecule for therapy
development. This review discusses the role of
CTLA-4 in the immune system and explores its
potential as a therapeutic target for melanoma and
other malignancies.

cancer are often correlated with better prognosis.6–8
Moreover, there is evidence that spontaneous antitumor immune responses are common in cancer
patients, although clinical regression is rare.
Along with recent advances in our understanding
of the complex cellular mechanisms regulating
immune responsiveness, such observations have led
to a revival of interest in the potential of cancer
immunotherapy. Since T cells play an essential role
in immunosurveillance and destruction of cancer
cells,5–9 modulation of peripheral immunoregulatory
responses to TAAs may represent a successful strategy for the immunotherapy of cancer.10

CANCER AND IMMUNITY

Antigen recognition and T-cell signaling
Activation, or ‘priming’, of naive T cells that recognize tumor cells must be initiated by ‘professional’
antigen presenting cells (APCs), primarily dendritic
cells. After processing, these cells present peptide
fragments of TAA, complexed with both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MHC class
II molecules, to T cells, thereby initiating an immune
reaction.11 MHCI-complexed antigen activates CD81
cells (cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTLs]), while MHCIIcomplexed peptides lead to the stimulation of CD41
T cells (helper cells).11,12
Two signals are required for APC-presented TAA
to be recognized as ‘foreign’ and an immune
response initiated.13 The first, or ‘signal 1,’ requires
recognition by the T-cell receptor complex (TCR) of
the tumor-cell peptide in association with MHC,
while signal 2 occurs in response to binding of CD80
or CD86 ligand isoforms on the APC surface with
CD28 receptor molecules on the T cell (Fig. 1).13–15
‘Signal 2’ is called the costimulatory signal and is
required for optimal T-cell activation. These interactions result in interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion, which
induces proliferation and differentiation into effector
T cells.13,16 Although tumor cells themselves may act
as APCs, as can any cell in the body, they are, however, unable to activate naive T cells directly. This is
because they usually lack CD80 or CD86 on their
surface and cannot provide costimulatory signal 2.17
Signal 1 alone is not sufficient to activate T-cell
responses optimally and may induce anergy.
The activation of T cells is critical to the immune
surveillance of tumors. Once activated, CTLs—the
major effectors of tumor regression—do not require
further costimulation, as MHCI-bound antigen is sufficient to elicit antigen recognition and cell-killing
mechanisms. Activated T cells, however, do not normally remain in the active state, as this is regulated
by a feedback loop. While this review focuses on
CTLA-4 as the key negative regulator, it is noteworthy

Malignant transformation and immunosurveillance
The concept of immunosurveillance was first proposed nearly 50 years ago when Sir F.M. Burnet suggested that ‘‘small accumulations of tumor cells may
develop and because of their possession of new antigenic potentialities provoke an effective immunological reaction with regression of the tumor and no
clinical hint of its existence.’’1 However, it is only
recently that this theory has regained widespread acceptance, following an increase in our understanding
of the molecular functions of the mammalian
immune system in health and disease.
A revolutionary milestone in the field of cancer
immunology was the identification of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs; eg, gp100, MAGE1 of 3, HER2/
neu, MUC1, PSA), which can be recognized by T
cells.2,3 TAAs may be shared among several types of
tumor or they can be the products of defective or
mutated genes unique to a specific type of tumor, in
which case they are called tumor-specific antigens.
TAAs may also be derived from genes that are only
active in early development, in a few specific tissues,
or are usually silently/minimally expressed. In the
latter case such genes must be considerably overexpressed and involved in critical cellular pathways in
tumor cells for the differential between these and
normal host cells to make meaningful immunotherapeutic strategies possible, such as the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2/neu).3
Individuals who are immunosuppressed show an
increased rate of tumor development and the number of tumors that appear to utilize immuno-evasion
strategies certainly argues for an immune response
against cancer.4 Activated T cells and antibodies to
various TAAs can be detected frequently in the blood
of individuals with a number of tumor types,5 also
supporting an active role of the immune system in
fighting cancer. A highly immunogenic tumor phenotype and evidence of a vigorous immune response to

that there are other immunoregulatory checkpoints,
which are also potential targets for therapeutic intervention. For example, programmed death ligand-1
(PDL-1) negatively regulates T-cell signaling and
effector functions, and CD137 enhances T-cell activation, natural killer cells, and APCs.18–22 In addition,
data suggest important regulatory roles for inhibitory
cytokines like transforming growth factor-b.23

ing interrupts signal 2 and turns off the activated T
cell; this reduces the T-cell population to a small
pool of memory cells.16 Therefore, CTLA-4 represents
an important negative switch, or checkpoint, that
controls the duration and intensity of an immune
response (Fig. 2).14,23 The precise mechanisms
involved in CTLA-4 interruption of T-cell activity are
discussed in more detail elsewhere.23,26
There is ample evidence to support a critical role
for CTLA-4 in normal immune function. For example, mice genetically deficient in CTLA-4 developed
lymphoproliferative disorders, with uncontrolled Tcell proliferation accompanied by tissue infiltration,
multiorgan failure, and early death.27,28 In humans,
CTLA-4 polymorphisms are linked to a range of autoimmune diseases,29 including thyroid diseases,30,31
Addison disease,31,32 type 1 diabetes,33 and rheumatoid arthritis.34 Equally, melanoma patients with
polymorphisms associated with reduced CTLA-4
expression show a more pronounced response to
blockade of the CTLA-4 pathway with an increased
frequency of immune-related symptoms and less
likelihood of subsequent recurrence.35 Finally, postvaccination CTLA-4 expression is inversely correlated
with survival in patients vaccinated with allogeneic
melanoma cell vaccine.36 These are all strong indicators supporting a pivotal role of the CTLA-4 immune
checkpoint in maintaining health and in disease development, as well as identifying this molecule as a
prospective therapeutic target in malignancy.

CTLA-4: an immunity checkpoint
Once T-cell activation has taken place there is a final,
important step that limits the proliferative response
of activated T cells, thereby restricting T-cell activation to areas of inflammation or injury, maintaining
peripheral tolerance, and preventing unnecessary
damage. This inhibition occurs in response to binding of CD80 or CD86 on the APC with CTLA-4 on the
T cell (Fig. 2).15,23
CTLA-4 is a homolog of CD28 and a member of
the immunoglobulin superfamily.23,24 It is difficult to
detect on resting T cells, but CTLA-4 expression is
induced upon T-cell activation. CTLA-4 moves rapidly from intracellular stores to the site of APC interaction at the immunological synapse, where it
remains up-regulated for 2 to 3 days after T-cell activation.16,25 CTLA-4 binds both CD80 and CD86 with
approximately 100-fold greater affinity than the
CD28 receptor, thus competing with CD28 for ligand
with superior effect.16 This competitive ligand bind-

Targeting CTLA-4 as a Cancer Therapy
CTLA-4 blockade in murine tumor models
The critical role of activated T cells in the anticancer
immune response, together with the down-regulatory
effects of CTLA-4 (Fig. 2), provide the hypothesis for
using CTLA-4 inhibitors in cancer therapy. This rationale is supported by extensive preclinical research
in a wide range of mouse models of cancer, which
have been reviewed extensively elsewhere.26,37 These
studies show not only that CTLA-4 blockade can
enhance endogenous immune responses to immunogenic tumors, but also that it can synergize with
multiple other interventions in less strongly immunogenic cancers.23
Vaccination strategies with CTLA-4 blockade. Studies
showing that anti-CTLA-4 antibody alone was not
active against poorly immunogenic tumors, such as
B16 melanoma, led to evaluation of its use in combination with vaccination. Combination immunotherapy of mice bearing B16 melanoma with anti-CTLA-4
antibody and a granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-producing tumor vaccine
induced rejection of subcutaneous and metastatic
tumors, accompanied by immune-related depigmentation.38 Depigmentation occurred also in CD4depleted mice, suggesting that both depigmentation
and tumor regression were mediated by CTLs specific for a self-antigen present on both normal melanocytes and melanoma cells. Surviving mice also
rejected a secondary tumor challenge.
The addition of anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody to vaccination enhanced T-cell activation and
memory.38 This is likely to be because CTLA-4 blockade either increased the magnitude of the immune
response to the vaccine or lowered the threshold of Tcell activation. In either case, autoreactive T cells
were involved in tumor rejection; consequently,
immune-related side effects, like depigmentation,
may be associated with successful cancer immunotherapy. Similar synergistic effects between CTLA-4
blockade and a GM-CSF-expressing antitumor vaccine were also seen in other poorly immunogenic
tumors, such as the mouse mammary carcinoma and
primary prostate cancer models.39,40 There is comparable synergism when using DNA instead of cellular
vaccines. CTLA-4 blockade enhanced B16 melanoma
tumor rejection in mice immunized against melanoma differentiation antigens.41 This effect was more
pronounced when anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody
was given with booster vaccinations, indicating that
administration sequence and schedule might be important considerations in clinical application.
Interestingly, anti-CTLA-4 antitumor effects in
mice were enhanced when antibody administration

2617

was combined with depletion of CD41/CD251 regulatory T cells (Treg).42 The antitumor effect of this
approach correlated directly with both the extent of
immune-related depigmentation and with peripheral
levels of CTLs against the TAA tyrosinase-related protein-2. Such a strategy overcomes dual mechanisms
of immune tolerance, namely, CTLA-4-mediated and
Treg-mediated, and represents a promising concept
for the induction of therapeutic antitumor immunity
in cancer patients. Other preclinical studies also
show that CTLA-4 blockade can act synergistically
with other treatment modalities including irradiation
and chemotherapy.43,44
The experiments described give not only proofof-concept that CTLA-4 blockade might be an effective anticancer treatment, but also provide clues and
insights into how such therapies might be integrated
with other interventions for optimal efficacy in
patients. Translation of these findings is already
under way with 2 anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in clinical
development: ipilimumab (MDX-010; Medarex and
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) and tremelimumab (CP-675,206; Pfizer, New York, NY).

Clinical trials
Ipilimumab and tremelimumab are both fully human
anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies that have been
studied primarily in patients with metastatic melanoma in phase 1 and 2 trials. Ipilimumab is an IgG1
antibody and tremelimumab is IgG2; both agents
bind to CTLA-4 with affinities <1 nM.37
Phase 1 trials. The first phase 1 trials with an antiCTLA-4 antibody utilized ipilimumab in patients
with metastatic melanoma and prostate cancer.45,46
Because of the immunological mechanism of action
and preclinical data available, traditional dose-escalation trials were not performed. Findings from these
trials showed that ipilimumab was well tolerated and
evidence of antitumor immunity provided a strong
basis for further clinical development. Hodi et al.47
showed that ipilimumab successfully enhanced or
‘reactivated’ antitumor immunity in patients who
had undergone previous vaccination with GM-CSFsecreting autologous tumor cells. A single intravenous (i.v.) dose of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg resulted in
extensive tumor necrosis with lymphocyte and granulocyte infiltration in 3 patients with metastatic
melanoma, and 2 patients with ovarian carcinoma
had lowering or stabilization of serum CA-125
levels. Notably, there were no serious toxicities,
although 5 melanoma patients developed immunerelated reactions.47
The first trial with tremelimumab was a doseescalation trial in which 39 patients with solid

2618

tumors, mostly melanoma, received an i.v. infusion
of tremelimumab at 1 of 7 dose levels (0.01, 0.1, 1.0,
3.0, 6.0, 10.0, and 15 mg/kg).48 Among 29 patients
with measurable disease, 2 had a complete response
(CR, maintained for 341 and 251 months), 2 a partial response (PR, maintained for 261 and 251
months), and 4 stable disease (SD). Five additional
patients were classified as having SD at the end of
the study, after undergoing surgical resection of
residual lesions followed by extended periods without disease progression. Dose-limiting toxicities and
immune-related adverse effects included vitiligo,
diarrhea, dermatitis, panhypopituitarism, and hyperthyroidism. The protocol-defined maximum tolerated dose was 10 mg/kg.48,49
In another study with tremelimumab, 30 patients
with melanoma received this agent at 10 mg/kg
monthly or 15 mg/kg every 3 months (Q3M). The
results showed that objective tumor responses were
associated with immune-related adverse events
(irAEs): 4 of 12 patients (33%) with irAEs responded,
compared with only 1 of 18 patients (5.6%) without
irAEs, suggesting irAEs may be a surrogate marker of
antitumor efficacy.50 Notably, in an analysis of the
long-term survival of patients participating in these 2
phase 1 trials, survival benefit appeared to be independent of objective tumor response.51
Based on the data from both phase 1 trials, 15
mg/kg Q3M was proposed as the recommended
dosage for tremelimumab in patients with metastatic
melanoma. This was based on the superior safety
profile, but similar antitumor activity, of 15 mg/kg
Q3M compared with 10 mg/kg monthly.49
Phase 2 trials. In a phase 2 trial in 72 patients with
previously untreated advanced melanoma, ipilimumab produced long-lasting objective clinical responses both alone and in combination with
dacarbazine (DTIC).52 Patients were randomized to
receive i.v. ipilimumab alone (3 mg/kg/month for 4
months) or with DTIC (250 mg/m2 for 5 days
monthly for 4 months). Overall objective response
rates were 5.4% and 17.1% for patients receiving
ipilimumab alone and with DTIC, respectively, while
corresponding median progression-free survival was
82 days and 99 days. The response to ipilimumab
plus DTIC appears greater than that reported with
DTIC alone.52
Concurrent administration of ipilimumab (3 mg/
kg every 3 weeks [Q3W] or 3 mg/kg initial dose then
1 mg/kg Q3W) and peptide vaccine in a phase 2 trial
in 56 patients with progressive stage IV melanoma
produced durable objective responses in 13% of
patients.53 Two patients achieved a CR (301 months
and 311 months) and 5 a PR, which was maintained

in 3 of them for 25, 26, and 34 months. In a preliminary study, ipilimumab (3 mg/kg Q3W) in combination with vaccination with 2 human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) class I-restricted peptides from the
gp100 melanoma-associated antigen gave 2 complete
and 1 partial response in 14 patients (21% response
rate) with metastatic melanoma.54
Finally, in a phase 1 and 2 trial in 36 patients
with advanced melanoma, combination therapy with
ipilimumab (0.1–3 mg/kg Q3W) and IL-2 produced
an objective response rate of 22% (8 of 36), with 3
complete responses and 6 patients maintaining their
responses at 11 to 19 months.55
An analysis of ipilimumab-treated patients from
5 clinical trials in patients with metastatic melanoma
demonstrates the novel kinetics of response observed
with CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody treatment. Data
from patients with an objective response to ipilimumab show that late onset of complete or partial
response was common, occurring after more than 12
weeks of treatment in the majority of responsive
patients. Furthermore, several patients who developed a CR or PR, usually after 12 weeks of treatment,
initially had progressive or stable disease. Such a
delayed onset of response should be considered
when reviewing the progress of patients receiving an
anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody. This report also
highlighted that responses with ipilimumab are often
more durable than may be expected with traditional
chemotherapy or incomplete responses to IL-2.56
Similar data have also been reported from a doseranging study (2.8–20 mg/kg) of ipilimumab monotherapy in 88 patients with advanced melanoma:
15% of patients (all dosing groups) had CR, PR, or
SD lasting for 24 weeks or more. There were 1 CR of
2631 days, 3 PRs of 211, 246 and 275 days, and 14
SDs including 9 SDs >24 weeks. Several patients had
a response preceded by months of SD.57 Further
research is warranted to help us better understand
why responses occur in this way, but it seems likely
to be related to the natural time course of an adaptive immune response that differs from the immediate cytotoxic effect associated with chemotherapy.
A phase 2 trial of tremelimumab in pretreated
patients with advanced melanoma compared 2 dosing regimens: 10 mg/kg once monthly (n 5 44) or 15
mg/kg Q3M (n 5 46). Preliminary data indicate that
there were 1 CR, 3 PR, and 11 SD in response to the
10 mg/kg once-monthly regimen, and 2 CRs, 1 PR,
and 15 SD after treatment with the 15 mg/kg Q3M.58
The median time to response was 219 and 125 days,
respectively, and the median survival was 10.2 and 11.5
months, respectively.58,59 Outcomes from clinical trials

and ipilimumab in combination with chemotherapy,
vaccines, or IL-2 are summarized in Table 1.
Other malignancies. Most completed studies with
ipilimumab are in patients with metastatic melanoma; however, its mechanism of action suggests it
should be active in many different tumor types.
Phase 1 and some phase 2 trials with ipilimumab
have been completed in other tumor types, particularly prostate cancer (Table 2). In a phase 1 trial a
single 3 mg/kg dose of ipilimumab was well tolerated, with some evidence of immunologic and antitumor activity.46 In another phase 1 trial escalating
doses of ipilimumab (0.5, 1.5, or 3 mg/kg) were combined with GM-CSF. Twenty-four patients were enrolled and 3 of 6 patients treated at the highest dose
level (3 mg/kg 3 4) had a >50% decline in serum
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level; all responders
also had an irAE. Data were also presented showing
that this combination can induce CD41 T-cell activation.60 Preliminary data from 12 patients enrolled
in a dose-escalation trial of ipilimumab (0.3, 1, 3, or
5 mg/kg) in combination with GM-CSF-gene-transduced allogeneic prostate cancer cellular (GVAX)
immunotherapy show 5 patients with a PR (PSA
decline >50%) and 3 with SD (<25% change in PSA).
Treatment appears well tolerated and all irAEs were
associated with response.61 In a randomized phase 2
trial, ipilimumab alone (3 mg/kg/month for 4
months) was compared with ipilimumab plus a single dose of docetaxel (75 mg/m2). Of the 23 patients
that received ipilimumab alone and the 20 that
received the combination, 3 in each group had
a > 50% decrease in PSA. Ipilimumab was well tolerated and irAEs were reported in 3 patients (6%,
including colitis and diarrhea).62 The safety and preliminary evidence of activity support ongoing trials
of ipilimumab in hormone-refractory prostate cancer

(HRPC) and other tumor types (Table 3). Trials of tremelimumab in other tumor types are also under way.
Recent data from a phase 2 trial of tremelimumab
(15 mg/kg Q3M until progressive disease) in patients
with treatment-refractory, metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum with a good performance status (ECOG status 5 0 or 1) showed that 46
of 47 patients experienced progressive disease or disease-related death before their second dose.63
Anti-CTLA-4 therapy is primarily being evaluated
in patients with advanced disease who have progressed after standard treatments. However, the
mechanism of action of these agents suggests that
they may be most effective in early-stage disease, or
in the adjuvant setting after tumor-reductive therapies. There has been 1 trial in the adjuvant setting in
which 25 patients with resected, high-risk, stage IIIc
or IV ( >3 positive lymph nodes) melanoma received
i.v. ipilimumab (3 mg/kg every 8 weeks for 12
months) given with 12 monthly doses of multipeptide vaccine. This regimen resulted in only 6 recurrences. The recurrences were successfully managed
either surgically or with biochemotherapy, and all
patients remained alive throughout the study.64
Patients with dose-limiting irAEs, including GI and
skin toxicity and hypopituitarism, responded to systemic steroids without needing hospitalization.64
Against this background, trials are planned to evaluate adjuvant therapy further with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Other regimens such as maintenance therapy
and reintroduction on progression are also being
investigated to establish the most effective way of
using these agents (Table 3).
Immune-related adverse events. irAEs have been
reported in most clinical trials with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies and are thought to be mediated by self-reactive T cells uncovered by anti-CTLA-4, indicating that

immune tolerance is broken. The most common
grade 3 or 4 class-related irAEs were dermatitis and
colitis (Fig. 3).50,53–55,64–66 Other serious but less common events included uveitis,53,55 hepatitis,53,54 and
hypophysitis.53,55,67 Most irAEs were manageable
with systemic steroids or other treatment. For optimal management of irAEs patients should be monitored carefully and treatment administered quickly if
required.50,53–55,64,65 In an analysis of 189 evaluable
patients with either stage IV melanoma or stage IV
renal-cell carcinoma, most patients who developed
enterocolitis responded to high-dose systemic steroids, with infliximab treatment producing prompt resolution in the few who were steroid-refractory. Five
patients developed colonic perforation or needed
colectomy, 1 of whom died of sepsis. Such severe
complications were relatively rare, and were more
frequent in patients with renal-cell carcinoma.65 The
guidelines followed at our institutions for the management of anti-CTLA-4 antibody-associated diarrhea/colitis and hepatotoxicity occurring during
ipilimumab treatment are summarized in Figures 4
and 5, respectively. It is noteworthy that Beck et al.65
reported that steroid treatment for irAEs did not
appear to affect antitumor efficacy, and findings
from a recent preclinical study also show that steroid
treatment does not affect anti-CTLA-4 antibodymediated antitumor activity.68
A significant correlation between irAEs and tumor responses has been demonstrated for both tremelimumab and ipilimumab (Table 4).50,53,65
Interestingly, in 2005 Attia et al.53 reported that of 14
patients with grade 3 or 4 irAEs, 5 (36%) had tumor
regression compared with only 2 of 42 patients (5%)
without immune toxicity (P 5 .008). However, in a
follow-up intrapatient dose-escalation study, higher
doses of ipilimumab increased irAEs but had no
effect on responses, suggesting the relation is not
dose-dependent.69 When considering these data we
should also take into account that data from other
trials has led to the suggestion that response may
not be the best predictor of survival after treatment
with this class of agent.
More extensive data are required, but the correlation between efficacy and irAEs suggests that the
interruption of peripheral tolerance is the underlying
mechanism of action of these compounds. In addition, irAEs may serve as a surrogate marker for therapeutic efficacy with anti-CTLA-4 treatment, although
vigilance is advised to enable prompt identification
and appropriate management of immune-related
symptoms.

otal trials with tremelimumab at 15 mg/kg Q3M
include a phase 2 single-arm study in patients with
advanced refractory and/or recurring melanoma and
a phase 3 trial of tremelimumab and either DTIC
or temozolomide versus tremelimumab alone in
untreated patients with advanced melanoma.
Ipilimumab is being investigated in other tumor
types including phase 3 trials in melanoma, phase 2
prostate cancer, and exploratory trials in lymphoma,
renal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and bladder cancer.
It is being evaluated as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted
molecules, and vaccines (Table 3). In early clinical
trials ipilimumab was given at 3 mg/kg Q3W; however, in the larger studies that started more recently
a higher dose, 10 mg/kg Q3W for 4 doses, is being
used. Studies at this dose include a large phase 2
study of ipilimumab monotherapy for patients with
previously treated unresectable stage III/IV melanoma and a phase 3 trial of ipilimumab plus DTIC
versus DTIC plus placebo for untreated patients with
unresectable stage III/IV melanoma. Several studies
are also in progress to evaluate the efficacy of different doses, up to 10 mg/kg Q3W. The increase in ipili-

mumab dose to 10 mg/kg Q3W was made as doselimiting toxicity has not been observed at the lower
doses,45,52 and with a view to maximizing antitumor
activity. In support of this, findings from a preliminary dose-escalation trial indicate ipilimumab is
more active at 10 mg/kg, with a response rate
(including SD) of 39%, than at lower doses and is
generally well tolerated.57

Conclusions and Future Directions
The encouraging clinical activity with anti-CTLA-4
therapy in melanoma serves as a model for the therapeutic potential of immunomodulation and paves
the way for developing new therapies and using
CTLA-4 blockade in other tumor types. Although
durable responses occurred and are associated with
irAEs, the exact mechanism of action of anti-CTLA4-mediated tumor regression and irAEs remains
unclear. There are 2 main hypotheses. First, the antiCTLA-4 mediated abrogation of the normal inhibitory signal that arises through binding with CD28
may favor a T-cell effector-driven response. Second,
CTLA-4 is also expressed on CD31/CD251 T-regulatory cells70 and treatment with an anti-CTLA-4

monoclonal antibody may deplete T-regulatory cells
resulting in an increase in T-effector cells. To date,
few studies have specifically evaluated the mechanism of action of these agents. However, Maker
et al.71 examined changes in lymphocyte phenotype
and function in patients with metastatic melanoma
treated with ipilimumab. The results showed that ipilimumab did not reduce the number of T-regulatory
cells, but it did increase the number of activated

cells. These data, therefore, support the first hypothesis—that involving an enhanced effector-T-cell
driven response, rather than depletion of T-regulatory cells. Further analysis of immunologic parameters in patients receiving anti-CTLA-4 antibodies is
required to clarify the mechanism of action of these
antibodies.
As both anti-CTLA-4 antibodies have progressed
to phase 3 trials, experience with these new experi-

mental drugs is growing; as a result, key issues are
emerging. First, efficacy needs to be assessed appropriately. The immunologic mechanism of action of
these agents is different from traditional cytotoxics
and preliminary data suggest the kinetics of response
also differ. As discussed, patients may not respond
until after 12 weeks or more of treatment. Consequently, additional experience and education will be
required to ensure efficacy is adequately assessed to
avoid premature patient discontinuation of therapy,
which could deprive patients a potential late response. Furthermore, clinical experience indicates
that response patterns associated with chemotherapy
may be different from those seen following immunotherapy; in the latter instance responses may
occur later, sometimes preceded by apparent progression. In addition, durable SD may be a frequent
and potentially beneficial outcome for patients with
advanced disease. Second, these agents have a novel
and unique adverse-event profile that physicians
should be aware of. Education and further research
is required to ensure these irAEs are treated promptly
and appropriately. In addition, we need to understand fully how these events relate to efficacy and
how, if at all, this can help us improve treatment outcome. Third, in view of the numerous new biologic
anticancer therapies that are available or in development, it is becoming necessary to identify which
patients are most likely to benefit from a specific
therapy. However, as noted in the prior points, we
need to establish fully the benefit associated with
CTLA-4 inhibition in terms of response and durable
SD before we can identify potentially responsive
patients. The results from the large phase 2 and 3
trials, as well as from an ongoing ipilimumab biomarker phase 3 study, will hopefully provide us with

more information. Finally, we need to understand
how to combine agents with different mechanisms of
action to achieve the best outcome. Within the T-cell
activation signaling network other ways of inhibiting
or augmenting this system are being explored and, in
the next decade, we expect many more agents will
begin clinical trials. For instance, BMS-663513
(Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY), a fully human
agonistic antibody against the human CD137 receptor, provides a strong costimulatory signal resulting
in enhanced activation and proliferation of CTLs as
well as APCs. The potentiating effects of this agent
on antigen recognition and immune effector functions have significant therapeutic potential for many
cancer types; phase 1 clinical trials are under way to
study its effects alone and in combination with
chemotherapy in patients with advanced solid
tumors. A phase 1 trial of a fully human anti-PD-1
monoclonal antibody has also started. Data from
preclinical studies show that treatment of mice with
an anti-PD-1 antibody can result in CTL-mediated
antitumor effects. Similarly, a murine antihuman
monoclonal antibody to OX40 (CD134) has entered
phase 1 clinical testing.72
In summary, new immunotherapeutic approaches
to cancer treatment have the promise to improve
treatment outcome for some of our most poorly
served patients. However, we are coming to realize
that the availability of these new immunotherapeutic
products may necessitate using novel efficacy endpoints, and perhaps a new way of efficacy assessment.
Conventional response evaluation criteria in solid
tumors (RECIST) may not adequately capture/reflect
efficacy of new immunotherapeutic products. Continued research, education, and effort are required to
ensure the optimal integration of these therapies into
our treatment algorithms, so ensuring the best possible treatment outcomes.
