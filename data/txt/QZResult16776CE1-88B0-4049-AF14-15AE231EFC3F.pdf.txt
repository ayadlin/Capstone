ABSTRACT
Purpose: To report the distant metastasis (DM) risk and patterns for
nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy
(IMRT) and to analyze the benefits of chemotherapy based on DM risk.
Materials and Methods: 576 NPC patients were analyzed. The DM rates were
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to compare
differences. The patients were divided into different risk subclassifications according
to DM hazard ratios.
Results: 91 patients developed DM after treatment, with bone as the most
common metastatic sites. 82.4% of DMs occurred within 3 years of treatment.
Patients were classified as low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk, and the
corresponding 5-year DM rates were 5.1%, 13.1% and 32.4%, respectively (P <
0.001). Chemotherapy failed to decrease the DM rate in the low-risk subclassification,
but decreased the DM risk in the intermediate-risk subclassification (P = 0.025). In
the high-risk subclassificaiton, the DM rate was 31.9% though chemotherapy was
used, which was significantly higher than that of other two subclassifications.
Conclusions: DM is the dominant treatment failure in NPC treated by IMRT,
with similar occurrence times and distributions to those that occurred in the era of
conventional radiotherapy. Further studies on treatment optimization are needed in
high-risk patients.

INTRODUCTION

to radiotherapy, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy
(IMRT) has replaced 2-dimensional radiotherapy (2DRT) as the first choice for non-disseminated NPC patients.
IMRT alone is applied in the treatment of early stage NPC,
whereas concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with or
without neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) or adjuvant

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare
malignancy in most parts of the world, but it is more
common in Southeast Asia, particularly among the
Southern Chinese population [1]. NPC is highly sensitive

chemotherapy (ACT) is recommended for locoregionally
advanced NPC according to NCCN guidelines.
With the dose superiority of intensity-modulated
radiotherapy (IMRT) technology, excellent locoregional
control has been achieved compared with 2D-RT, even
in locoregionally advanced patients, with a relatively
low incidence of severe complications [2]. However,
this improvement in locoregional control has not been
accompanied by an increase in long-term overall survival.
Reports from other centers have also shown persistently
high distant metastasis (DM) rates in patients who
received IMRT, resulting in a predominant failure pattern
[3-6].
As IMRT has been widely applied around the world,
it is necessary to understand the failure patterns, DM
features and benefits of chemotherapy in NPC patients
who have undergone IMRT in order to provide further
guidance regarding treatment choices and clinical trial
design.

III-IV); after 2005, 9 patients with stage III-IV did not
receive chemotherapy for the following reasons: age
older than 65 years, contraindications to chemotherapy, or
patient preference. Among the 376 patients who received
chemotherapy, 46 patients had stage II disease, and 328
patients had stage III-IVa-b disease. A total of 236 patients
were treated with CCRT alone, 121 patients were treated
with NACT followed by CCRT, and 19 patients received
other chemotherapy regimens, based on acute toxicity of
chemotherapy or their preference [15 patients received
NACT alone, 2 patients received CCRT + adjuvant
chemotherapy (ACT), and 2 patients received ACT alone].
The ACT schedule was 80 mg/m2 cisplatin on day 1 and
72 hours of continuous intravenous infusion of 4.0 g/m2
5-fluorouracil at 3 weeks after IMRT repeated every 3
weeks for two cycles.

RESULTS

The last follow-up date was December 31, 2014,
and the median follow-up time was 103.6 months (range,
4.2-166.8 months) for the entire cohort and 112.3 months
(range, 29.4-166.8 months) for the surviving patients.
A total of 21 patients (4.0%) were lost to follow-up. At
the time of analysis, 133 patients were found to have
treatment failures, and 91 patients (68.4%) had at least
one site of DM. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 8-year DM rates were
5.9%, 12.7%, 14.5%, and 16.4%, respectively. Among
the failures, 75 experienced DM alone, 42 developed
locoregional failure alone, and 16 failed in both distant
and locoregional sites (Figure 1). Locoregional control
was achieved in most (82.4%) patients who exhibited
DM. Specifically, only 5 (10.6%) patients presented failed
locoregional control when DMs were diagnosed in the first
year after treatment.

Treatment results and failure patterns

Patient characteristics
The characteristics, treatment factors and treatment
parameters of 576 patients are summarized in Table 1.
Of these patients, 443 were male, and 133 were female.
The median age was 43 years (13-78 years), and 99.8%
of the patients were pathologically confirmed to have
WHO type IIa or type IIb NPC. All patients received
radical IMRT. The average mean dose of GTVnx and
GTVnd was 74.3 Gy (63.6-79.8 Gy) and 66.82 Gy (64.8376.6 Gy), respectively. In total, 376 (65.3%) patients
received chemoradiotherapy, and 200 (34.7%) patients
were treated with IMRT alone (72 patients were stage

advanced and regionally advanced (T3-4N3) disease had
the highest risk for DM (HR = 22.206, P = 0.003).
Based on the DM hazard ratio analysis, we were
able to classify 576 patients into three subclassifications:
low-risk (HR ≤ 5.0), intermediate-risk (HR > 5.0, ≤ 10.0)
and high-risk (HR > 10.0). The low-risk subclassification
included 176 patients with T1-2N0-1 diseases, wherein
only 11 (6.3%) patients had DM. The intermediate-risk
subclassification included 282 patients with T3-4N0-1 or
T1-2N2 diseases, wherein 42 (14.9%) patients had DM.
The high-risk subclassification included 118 patients with
T3-4N2 or any T with N3 diseases, wherein 38 (32.2%)
patients had DM (Table 3). The 5-year DM rate for lowrisk patients was very low at 5.1%, and the rates were
13.1% and 32.4% for intermediate-risk and high-risk
patients, respectively. A comparison revealed that the
DM rates were significantly different among these three
subclassifications (χ2 = 43.533, P < 0.001) (Figure 3).

The median time interval between treatment and
DM detection was 12.2 months (range, 1.3-90.5 months),
with 51.6% of the DMs occurring within 1 year after
completion of treatment, 72.5% within 2 years, 82.4%
within 3 years, 85.7% within 4 years and 92.3% within
5 years. The survival duration after DM ranged from 0.8
to 143.7 months with a median of 14.0 months. The five
most common metastatic sites were as follows: bone, 51
cases; lung, 32 cases; liver, 27 cases; distant lymph nodes,
10 cases; and adrenal gland, 2 cases. In total, 68.1% of the
patients who experienced DM presented with individual
sites. The details are shown in Table 2.

Hazards according to various T and N subgroups
for DM and risk subclassification

DM rates of three risk subclassifications treated
with chemoradiotherapy

To evaluate the relative risk of DM for different
T and N subgroups, the hazard ratios (HRs) for each
subgroup were calculated with DM as the endpoint.
The HR of patients with T1N1 disease was defined at
baseline (HR = 1.00), and host factors (age and sex) and
locoregional recurrence were included as covariates.
T1N0 was analyzed together with T2N0 due to the limited
number of cases. Similarly, T1N2 and T2N2, T3N0
and T3N1, T4N0 and T4N1, and any T with N3 were
combined and analyzed. Then, the patients were divided
into 9 subgroups. The HR of DM increased with higher
T stage and N stage for certain N and T classifications,
respectively (Figure 2). Patients with both locally

To study the role of CCRT with or without NACT
in the different risk subclassifications, we eliminated
17 patients treated with NACT or ACT alone and 2
patients treated with CCRT and ACT. In the low-risk
subclassification, 128 patients had stage IIb disease, 85
patients were treated with IMRT alone, and 43 patients
received CCRT with or without NACT. The corresponding
5-year DM rates were 7.1% and 7.0% (χ2 = 0.703, P =
0.402), respectively (Figure 4). In the intermediate-risk

subclassification, 58 patients were treated with IMRT
alone, and 212 patients received CCRT with or without
NACT. The addition of chemotherapy to IMRT was
associated with an absolute decrease by 5.8% in the 5-year
DM rate for the intermediate-risk subclassification (Figure
4, 17.5% vs. 11.7%; χ2 = 5.032, P = 0.025). In the highrisk subclassification, most patients (100/114) received
CCRT with or without NACT, and only 14 were treated
with IMRT alone. In patients who received CCRT with
or without NACT, the DM rate was significantly higher
in high-risk patients than in low-risk patients (Figure 4,
31.9% vs. 7.0%, χ2 = 7.210, P = 0.007) or intermediaterisk patients (Figure 4, 31.9% vs. 11.7%, χ2 = 20.545, P
< 0.001). However, no significant difference in the 5-year
DM rate was observed between low-risk and intermediaterisk patients treated with CCRT with or without NACT
(Figure 4, 7.0% vs. 11.7%, χ2 = 0.054, P = 0.816).

(14.9%)

(32.2%)

The 5- and 8-year DM rates of our cohort were 14.5% and
16.4%, respectively.
In previous studies based on 2D-RT, 46.9% to
59.2% of all failure sites after definitive radiotherapy
included at least one distant site [10-13], which was lower
than the result (68.2%) observed in our study. The main
treatment failure patterns in the 2D-RT era included both
locoregional recurrence and DM with similar occurrence
rates [10, 11, 13, 14]. However, DM alone accounted
for 56.1% of all treatment failures and became the
predominant pattern, while locoregional failure alone
accounted for less than a third of failures. This finding
might be attributed to excellent locoregional control after
the use of IMRT and advanced diagnostic techniques.
Locoregional failure is a significant adverse
prognostic factor for DM in head and neck cancers [15,
16]. Patients with locoregional failures may have more
aggressive cancer, which spreads more rapidly, and
persistent/recurrent cancer is predisposed to DM. When
IMRT was applied, excellent locoregional control was
achieved; however, the distant control did not correspond
to the decreasing trend of locoregional control. In reality,
the DM rate was persistently high. Moreover, 82.4% of
DMs were noted in patients with successful locoregional
control. A high probability of micrometastases may
explain this finding [15, 17, 18]. A portion of patients

DISCUSSION
In the past two decades, IMRT has gradually gained
popularity in the definitive treatment of NPC. Its technical
advantage has already translated into improved clinical
outcomes, particularly for the local control rate, which
was approximately 90% in our current study and in the
literature [3-6, 9]. DM has been the main cause of failure.

without obvious clinical evidence of metastases at the
time of initial diagnosis may already have had subclinical
micrometastases that could not be detected by regular
examinations [19], and thus, the increased irradiation
dose by IMRT was unable to increase the probability of
eliminating micrometastatic lesions. This line of thought
is further supported by the early occurrence of DM. In our
study, more than half of the DMs occurred within one year,
and of these, only 5 (10.6%) patients failed locoregionally
when DM was diagnosed.
In the present study, bone was the most common
metastatic site and isolated bone metastasis was often
observed. Bone was followed by the lung and liver, with
other sites rarely appearing. This result is consistent with
many other reports, including reports based on 2D-RT
[9, 10, 18, 20]. Yi et al. [10] reported a median time of
13 months in a large cohort of NPC patients treated with

the 2D-RT technique, which was similar to the median
time of 12.2 months after treatment in the present study.
The majority (82.4%) of DMs occurred within 3 years of
treatment. After 3 years, DM was quite rare. Many other
studies from different cancer centers reported similar
results [3, 4, 9, 21]. Therefore, close follow-ups 3 years
after treatment are necessary to detect distant metastatic
lesions and to provide aggressive treatment as early as
possible.
The treatment of DM is always a challenge, and
the survival time is extremely short despite the use
of aggressive treatment [4, 22, 23]. The current study
reported a median survival time of 14.4 months after DM,
even when individualized therapy was given. Therefore,
preventing the development of DM has become a key
strategy to improve survival.

between IMRT and 2D-RT likely indicate that IMRT had
little effect on distant control, and compared with 2DRT, the survival benefits of IMRT possibly originated
from the high rate of locoregional control. IMRT appears
to have a limited contribution to distant control in NPC
patients, and new strategies combining different treatment
modalities to effectively reduce the rate of DM need to
be investigated in the future. In addition, new detection
approaches for DM, such as comprehensive pretreatment
examinations, including positron emission tomography/
computed tomography and tumor markers, may increase
the likelihood of detecting metastases.
Based on multiple phase III studies and metaanalyses, concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy
is the current standard of care for locally advanced
disease (AJCCmanual [7th edition] stages II-IVb), as
recommended by the latest version of the NCCN [24]
and EHNS–ESMO–ESTRO guidelines [25]. Other CRT
regimens are also adaptable for locoregionally advanced
NPC patients, including NACT+CCRT and CCRT+ACT.
However, it is of vital importance to optimize individual
treatment strategies for locoregionally advanced patients,
particularly considering the various DM risks for different
combinations of T and N classifications (Figure 2).
As we classified patients based on the HR of
T and N combinations, the 5-year DM rate of the lowrisk group was extremely low, regardless of whether the
patients received IMRT alone or CRT. For patients with
stage IIb disease, it remains uncertain whether CCRT and
adjuvant chemotherapy reduced the risk of DM. Despite
the survival benefit of CCRT over 2D-RT alone in Mai
et al.’s report of a phase III RCT, the results may not be
reproducible in the IMRT era. Retrospective data on NPC
patients who underwent IMRT in a study by Macao and
Tham also did not demonstrate a survival benefit of CCRT
in stage IIb patients [26, 27]. Future research may need to
focus on improving the quality of life for these patients.
For the intermediate- and high-risk groups, which
included patients with locally and/or regionally advanced
disease, the 5-year DM rate was 14.1% and 32.7%,
respectively. Locoregional treatment alone was therefore
inadequate for these two groups of patients. Systemic
chemotherapy should be included in the primary treatment
for patients with an intermediate or high risk of DM. A
meta-analysis with individual data performed by Baujat
[28] analyzed 1, 753 patients from eight randomized
clinical trials. These authors found that the addition of
chemotherapy to standard RT provided a significant
survival benefit in patients with NPC, particularly when
chemotherapy was administered concomitantly with
RT, thus lowering the risk of distant failure (P = 0.001;
HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59–0.87). However, Lin et al. [29]
and Lee et al. [30] reported that chemotherapy failed to
improve distant control when IMRT was used for NPC
patients. A possible explanation for the discrepancy is the
different patient cohorts.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In the present study, the use of chemotherapy
benefited the intermediate-risk group with an absolute
decline of 6.7% in the 5-year DM rate (P = 0.025).
Therefore, for the intermediate-risk group, the current
treatment regimen of CRT may be used as the standard,
and further investigation may be needed to evaluate the
utility of NACT or ACT.
In contrast, the DM rate of the high-risk subgroup
was 31.9%. Further analysis of the role of chemotherapy
in the high-risk group was not performed because of a
relatively small number of patients who did not receive
chemotherapy. Although aggressive treatments were given
to the majority of patients, the outcome was still poor
(38/118). A multicenter randomized study in Hong Kong
(NPC 0501 Trial) [31] regarding various chemotherapy
schemes recently reported its preliminary results that
induction cisplatin and capecitabine (PX) presented a
favorable trend in progression-free survival compared
to adjuvant cisplatin and fluorouracil (PF) (P = 0.045).
Furthermore, adjusted analyses indicated that induction
PX had a lower risk of death (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.340.97) than induction PF. Unfortunately, the impact on DM
was not analyzed. A more efficacious systemic treatment
using more effective regimens and/or different treatment
sequences should be included in future clinical trials for
high-risk patients. Targeted drugs and immunotherapy also
warrant investigation in this subgroup. A closer followup after treatment is of vital importance for these NPC
patients.
This study was retrospective and has all the
limitations of a retrospective analysis. A strength of
the study was that it had a large number of patients for
characterizing DM.
In conclusion, the current study shows that DM has
become the predominant pattern of failure in NPC patients
who undergo IMRT with or without chemotherapy. IMRT
had no impact on the metastatic timing and distribution of
DM. Treatment strategies for different risk stratifications
need to be developed. The present study will be useful in
guiding future therapeutic trials. More effective systemic
chemotherapy and different treatment sequences should be
explored for high-risk patients in the future.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient selection
Between April 2001 and December 2009, 984
pathologically diagnosed, non-metastatic NPC patients
were treated with IMRT with curative intent in our
center. To avoid non-uniform treatment strategies used by
different oncologists, we enrolled a total of 576 patients
who received all of their treatments from our team for
this retrospective analysis. The pretreatment workup
24518

of all patients included a complete history and physical
examination, hematological and biochemical profiles,
nasopharyngoscopy, chest radiography, ultrasonography of
the abdominal region and whole body emission computed
tomography (ECT). Among these patients, 83 (14.4%)
underwent head and neck contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CT) scans, and 493 (85.6%) underwent
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and neck
before treatment. For N3 patients or when otherwise
indicated, CT scans of the chest and abdomen or positron
emission tomography (PET) scans were performed to
exclude DM.

spare these structures depended on the extent and location
of the tumor. The maximum doses to these structures were
restricted to avoid exceeding their tolerance doses, which
were as follows: 56 Gy for the brainstem, 45 Gy for the
spinal cord, 60 Gy for the temporal lobes, 8 Gy for the
lens, and 60 Gy for the optic nerves and chiasm; the mean
doses to the temporomandibular joints, mandible and
parotids were 50 Gy, 50 Gy and 40 Gy, respectively.
In our cancer center, chemotherapy was not
routinely used for locoregionally advanced NPC until Nov
2004, when Langendijk et al. [8] reported that concurrent
chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) was the most effective way to
improve overall survival in locoregionally advanced NPC.
In our center, cisplatin-based CCRT was administered
to patients with stage III-IV disease from 2005 onward.
For patients with stage II disease, CCRT was used at the
discretion of the attending oncologists, taking into account
the patient’s preference. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(NACT) followed by CCRT was administered based on
therapeutic clinical trials. The CCRT schedule was IMRT
concurrent with intravenous infusion of cisplatin (80 mg/
m2/day) on days 1 and 22. The NACT schedule was 80
mg/m2 cisplatin on day 1 and 4.0 g/m2 5-fluorouracil with
72 hours of continuous intravenous infusion repeated
every 3 weeks for two cycles.
For patients developed DM after definitive
radiotherapy, chemotherapy is the main treatment choice
and usually 4-6 cycles’ chemotherapy was given to
those patients. The choice of chemotherapy should be
individualized based on patients’ characteristics, including
PS, age, goals of therapy, previous chemotherapy agents
and cycles, etc. Generally, combination chemotherapy
could be selected for patients in good status and single
agents would be preferred for patient in poor condition.
Targeted therapy, for specific, cetuximab could also be
used in palliative treatment. Local treatments were also
given on a case-by-case basis. Positive treatment would
be suggested if the patient had solitary metastasis, such
as radiation for solitary bone metastasis and ablation for
solitary liver metastasis. Palliative adjunctive measures
include radiation to areas of symptomatic disease,
analgesics, other measures to control other manifestations
of disease spread (eg, hypercalcemia) and close monitoring
of nutritional status and nutritional support.

Clinical stage
The patients included were treated from April 2001,
and 54 patients were staged according to the 5th edition
of the Union for International Cancer Control staging
system/American Joint Commission on Cancer (UICC/
AJCC) TNM classification. After the publication of the
2002 UICC/AJCC system, the remaining patients were
staged according to the 6th edition of the UICC/AJCC
TNM classification, and in January 2010, the 7th edition
of the UICC/AJCC TNM classification was published and
widely used in clinical practice. In the current study, the
diseases of all patients were restaged according to the 7th
edition of the UICC/AJCC TNM classification based on
the recorded clinical and radiological data.

Patient treatment
All patients received radical IMRT. IMRT was
delivered with a dynamic multileaf intensity-modulating
collimator (NOMOS Corporation, Sewickley, Pa) using
a slice-by-slice arc rotation approach. The details of the
IMRT technique and delineation of the target volumes,
including the gross tumor volume of the nasopharynx
(GTVnx), the positive neck lymph nodes (GTVnd),
the high-risk sites of microscopic extension and the
whole nasopharynx (CTV1), and the low-risk sites of
microscopic extension, the level of the lymph node
located, and the elective neck area (CTV2), have been
previously described [2, 7]. All organs at risk (OARs),
including the brainstem, spinal cord, temporal lobe,
optic nerves and chiasm, pituitary, lens, parotid glands,
temporomandibular joints, and mandible, were carefully
outlined. The prescribed dose was 66-68 Gy to GTVnx,
62-64 Gy to GTVnd, 60 Gy to CTV1 and 54 Gy to
CTV2 in 30 fractions. In addition, the prescribed dose
for irradiation to the lower neck and the supraclavicular
fossae with the conventional RT technique was 50 Gy/25
fractions for prophylactic intent and 60-66 Gy/30-33
fractions for therapeutic intent. The dose constraints
to the OARs were reduced as much as possible without
sacrificing coverage of the tumor target. The ability to

Patient assessment and follow-up
All patients underwent evaluations, including
hematological
and
biochemical
profiles
and
nasopharyngoscopy, at least once a week during treatment.
The first assessment of the tumor response was performed
by physical examination and nasopharyngoscopy 1
month after the completion of treatment. This assessment
was followed by MRI of the head and neck 3 months
after radiotherapy. Then, the patients were followed
up every 3 months during the first 3 years, every 6

months during years 3-5, and annually thereafter. Each
follow-up included complete physical and fiberoptic
nasopharyngoscopy or indirect nasopharyngeal speculum
examinations. Biochemical profiles, chest X-ray,
ultrasound of the liver and abdomen and MRI of the head
and neck were also routine elements of the assessment.
Further investigations were performed when clinically
indicated. Local recurrence was confirmed by biopsy for
most patients. Patients with recurrence in inaccessible
sites, such as the skull base and intracranial cavity, were
diagnosed radiologically according to local disease
progression. DM was defined as having one or more of the
following conditions: (1) histologically confirmed DM;
(2) equivocal evidence of DM in the imaging study and
subsequent histological evidence or clinical progression;
and (3) unfeasible biopsy of the lesion of interest (e.g.,
bone site), but with the presence of DM confirmed by two
types of imaging studies (e.g., MRI and ECT/or PET) with
a concordant clinical course.

DM was assessed as the endpoint. The time periods
were calculated from the date of pathological diagnosis
to the date of DM diagnosis. The DM rate was calculated
with the Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences
were compared with a log-rank test. Hazard ratios were
calculated by a Cox proportion hazards model (backward
Wald). Two-tailed values of P < 0.05 were considered
significant. Statistical analysis was performed using
the SPSS software package (Version 16.0, SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL).
