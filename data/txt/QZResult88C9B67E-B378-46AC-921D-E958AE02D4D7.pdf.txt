ABSTRACT
Relapse is the major cause of treatment-failure in adults with B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) achieving complete remission after induction
chemotherapy. Greater precision identifying persons likely to relapse is important.
We did bio-informatics analyses of transcriptomic data to identify mRNA transcripts
aberrantly-expressed in B-cell ALL. We selected 9 candidate genes for validation
7 of which proved significantly-associated with B-cell ALL. We next focused on
function and clinical correlations of the cysteine and glycine-rich protein 2 (CSRP2).
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to examine
gene transcript levels in bone marrow samples from 236 adults with B-cell ALL
compared with samples from normals. CSRP2 was over-expressed in 228 out of 236
adults (97%) with newly-diagnosed B-cell ALL. A prognostic value was assessed in
168 subjects. In subjects with normal cytogenetics those with high CSRP2 transcript
levels had a higher 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and worse relapsefree survival (RFS) compared with subjects with low transcript levels (56% [95%
confidence interval, 53, 59%] vs. 19% [18, 20%]; P = 0.011 and 41% [17, 65%] vs.
80% [66–95%]; P = 0.007). In multivariate analyses a high CSRP2 transcript level
was independently-associated with CIR (HR = 5.32 [1.64–17.28]; P = 0.005) and RFS
(HR = 5.56 [1.87, 16.53]; P = 0.002). Functional analyses indicated CSRP2 promoted
cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, in vitro colony formation and cell migration
ability. Abnormal CSRP2 expression was associated with resistance to chemotherapy;
sensitivity was restored by down-regulating CSRP2 expression.

INTRODUCTION

(CIR) and worse relapse-free survival (RFS) in adults with
B-cell ALL and normal cytogenetics.

B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is
characterized by clonal expansion of developmentallyarrested B-cell precursors [1]. Although survival of adults
with B-cell ALL has improved relapse is an important
problem. Prognostic models for relapse include age, WBC
levels at diagnosis, immune phenotype, cytogenetics,
mutational landscape, response to induction therapy and
measureable residual disease (MRD) after completing
therapy [2]. Adverse cytogenetic and mutations include
hypo-diploidy (< 44 chromosomes), MLL/11q23
translocations, complex cytogenetics (≥ 5 abnormalities)
and t (9; 22) and/or BCR-ABL1 [2]. However, about onehalf of adults with B-cell ALL have none of the adverse
prognostic variables at diagnosis making predicting relapse
difficult, especially so in those with normal cytogenetics
[3, 4]. Identifying a new prognostic variable in these persons
is important [5].
Analyzing differential expression of mRNAs is a
new approach to predicting outcomes of persons with
B-cell ALL. For example, in adults with B-cell ALL
increased CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) and
LEF1 (lymphoid enhancer binding factor-1) expression
are associated with worse RFS [6, 7] whereas increased
BAALC (brain and acute leukemia, cytoplasmic) expression
is associated with an unfavorable response to chemotherapy
and worse survival [8].
A bioinformatics-based evaluation of candidate
mRNAs improves efficiency compared with random
sampling [9]. We used publicly available genome-wide
mRNA expression data from patients with B-cell ALL to
identify differentially expressed transcripts compared with
normals. We identified 9 candidate genes 7 of which we
validated and focused our attention on CSRP2 (cysteine
and glycine-rich protein 2). CSRP2 is a member of CSRP
family encoding a group of short LIM domain proteins
(21 kDa) which are critical regulators of development
and differentiation [10]. The three CSRPs (CSRP1-3) are
preferentially expressed in muscle cells localizing to the
nucleus and cytoplasm [11]. In the nucleus, they facilitate
smooth muscle differentiation via interactions with
transcription factors [12]. In the cytoplasm they decorate
filamentous actin structures and participate in cytoskeletal
remodeling [13]. CSRP2 maps to 12q21 which is reported
abnormal in haematological neoplasms including T-cell
ALL and lymphoma [14–16]. Increased CSRP2 transcript
levels are associated with dedifferentiation in hepatocellular
carcinoma [17]. In microarray-based analyses highexpression of CSRP2 is associated with basal-like breast
cancer [18, 19]. However, there were no reports regarding
the role of CSRP2 in hematological neoplasms. Here, we
studied levels of CSRP2 transcripts for an association with
relapse probability in adults with B-cell ALL. We show
increased CSRP2 transcript levels are independentlyassociated with higher cumulative incidence of relapse

RESULTS
Validation of new biomarkers for B-cell ALL
based on genome-wide mRNA analyses
We studied differentially-expressed genes in normal
and B-cell ALL using data from the ImmuSort database
(http://immusort.bjmu.edu.cn; Table 1). We focused on
the top 20 differentially expressed genes based on the
delta values > 45 and average rank scores (ARSs) > 80
in B-cell ALL samples. To increase reliability of our
analyses we updated these data with relevant data from the
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) [9]. The final dataset
was based on 400 B-cell samples (GEO samples/GSMs,
arrays or measurements) from normals and 690 samples
from persons with B-cell ALL and confirmed our target
gene selection.
Differentially-expressed genes meeting our
threshold included CTGF (connective tissue growth
factor), ZNF423 (zinc finger protein 423), VPREB1
(pre-B lymphocyte 1), SLC22A16 (solute carrier family
22 member 16), ERG (ETS transcription factor), IGFBP7
(insulin like growth factor binding protein 7), FLT3 (fms
related tyrosine kinase-3), DNTT (DNA nucleotidyl
exotransferase), SPRY2 (sprouty RTK signaling antagonist
2), CLEC11A (C-type lectin domain family 11 member
A) and DBN1 (drebrin-1). Expression of several of
these genes such as CTGF and DNTT (TdT) are reported
to correlate with therapy-outcomes of persons with
B-cell ALL [6, 20–29]. Consequently, we focused on 9
previously-unstudied genes including C5orf62 (SMIM3;
small integral membrane protein 3), GNA15 (G-protein
subunit alpha 15), CSRP2, HBEGF (heparin binding EGF
like growth factor), RASD1 (RAS-related dexamethasone
induced-1), CPNE2 (copine-2), FRMD4B (FERM domain
containing 4B), C19orf77 (SMIM24; small integral
membrane protein 24) and COL5A1 (collagen type-V
alpha-1 chain; Table 1 and Figure 1).
Next we used RT-qPCR to verify differential
mRNA levels of these genes in bone marrow cells from
26 adults with newly-diagnosed B-cell ALL compared
with cells from 23 normals (Figure 2A). mRNA levels of
CSRP2, COL5A1, RASD1 and C5orf62 were significantly
increased whereas HBEGF, GNA15, FRMD4B, C19orf77
and CPNE2 were not.
Our re-analysis of cases of B-cell ALL in ImmuSort
revealed most samples were from children with B-cell
ALL. Consequently, we re-searched the GEO database
and found the GSE34861 dataset was from adults with
B-cell ALL (191 GSMs) [30]. However, this dataset was
not derived from the Affymetrix Human Genome U133
Plus 2.0 Array platform (GEO platform/GPL570) but from
the NimbleGen Human Expression Array (GPL15088)

CSRP2 transcript levels in B-cell ALL

despite the fact both platforms include genome-wide
transcriptome arrays. We next rank-normalized the dataset
to derive ARS values for these genes as described [9].
We found all genes shown in Table 1 except C19orf77
not included in the GPL15088 platform were also upregulated. FRMD4B had the lowest ARS value (61.76) and
the remaining genes had ARS values > 75.
Because our RT-qPCR validation studies used
ABL1 as an internal control we compared ABL1
expression in children and adults with B-cell ALL.
ABL1 mRNA levels were dramatically higher in
adults with B-cell ALL with ARS ≥ 93 compared with
children B-cell ALL with ARS ≥ 86 (Supplementary
Figure 1). Consequently, we switched to a GAPDH
(glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) internal
control and re-studied 9 genes 7 of which were upregulated (Figure 2B). There were insufficient data to
critically-analyze FRMD4B and CPNE2 which had Q3
values which skewed higher than controls (Figure 2B).
CSRP2 was the most differentially expressed gene in our
validation studies (Figure 2).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CSRP2 transcript levels were significantly higher
in B-cell ALL cell lines (BV173, Sup-B15 and BALL-1)
and a mantle cell lymphoma cell line (MAVER) compared
with T-cell ALL cell lines (6T-CEM, MOLT4), a chronic
myeloid leukemia cell line (K562), acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML) cell lines (KG-1, NB4, HL60) or other
lymphoma cell lines (U937, Raji, Ramos; Figure 3A and
Supplementary Table 1).
Next we studied bone marrow samples from subjects
with B-cell ALL at diagnosis. CSRP2 transcript levels
were significantly higher (median 53%; range 0 – 1066%)
compared with levels in 43 normals (0.44%; 0 – 1.78%;
P < 0.0001; Figure 3B). Receiver-operator characteristic
(ROC) curve analyses identified an area under the curve
(AUC) for CSRP2 transcript levels of 0.980 (95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.964, 0.996; P < 0.0001) with a
maximum CSRP2 transcript level Youden index of 1.83%.
Using this cut-off value the rate of CSRP2 over-expression
in newly-diagnosed adult B-cell ALL was 97%. Subjects

with MLL translocation (N = 11; median 262%; range
63–995%) had the highest CSRP2 transcript levels.
Subjects with a normal cytogenetics (N = 56; 49%
[0.21, 548%]) or BCR-ABL1 (N = 56; 42% [0.46, 269%])
had lower CSRP2 transcript levels (Figure 3C). These
results agree with the data set of GSE34861 [30] which
included samples from 191 adults with B-cell ALL
(Figure 3D).
The subjects were divided into cohorts with high
or low CSRP2 transcript levels at the median CSRP2
transcript value. All subjects with an MLL translocation
and more subjects with a WBC > 30 × 10E+9/L were in
the high CSRP2 transcript level cohort (Table 2). There
was no significant association between CSRP2 transcript
levels and age, sex, platelet level, percent bone marrow
blasts, immune phenotype, BCR-ABL1, IKZF1 deletion,
risk group, MRD-test result at the end of induction therapy
and/or post-remission therapy in multi-variate analyses
(Table 2).

88% [81, 94%]; P = 0.488). Five-year CIR in subjects
achieving remission with high CSRP2 transcript levels
was significantly higher than in subjects with low CSRP2
transcript levels (60% [58, 61%] vs. 34% [33, 34%];
P = 0.043; Figure 4A). In subjects with low CSRP2
transcript levels 5-year RFS was 64% (53, 76%) compared
with 39% (22, 55%; P = 0.060) in subjects with high
CSRP2 transcript levels (Figure 4B). In multivariate
analyses including age (≥ vs. < 35 years), gender,
WBC (≥ vs. <30×10E+9/L), BCR-ABL1 (N/Y), MLL
translocation (no/yes) or IKZF1 deletion (N/Y), treatment
(chemotherapy only vs. chemotherapy/allotransplant),
MRD-test result at the end of induction therapy (negative/
positive) and CSRP2 transcript level (low/high), a negative
MRD-test result, female sex, no MLL translocation and
chemotherapy/allotransplant were associated with lower
CIR (Table 3). Female sex, no MLL translocation and
chemotherapy/allotransplant were associated with better
RFS (Table 3).

Proliferation was significantly decreased in CSRP2-KD
BV173 cells compared with cells transfected with control
lentiviral particles. In contrast, CSRP2-over-expression in
CSRP2-OE markedly- increased proliferation (Figure 5B).
We also tested whether CSRP2 expression promoted
colony formation. Silencing of CSRP2 expression
significantly decreased numbers of colony-forming units
compared with controls. CSRP2 over-expression had the
converse effect (Figure 5C).
To further study the in vivo oncogenic activity of
CSRP2 unmodified Ramos cells and CSRP2-OE Ramos
cells were injected subcutaneously into the dorsal right
ﬂank of nude mice. Tumors induced by CSRP2-OE
Ramos cells were signiﬁcantly larger than tumors induced

by control Ramos cells (P < 0.01; Figure 5D). These data
indicate CSRP2 increases the oncogenicity of neoplastic
B-cell lines in vitro and in vivo.

increased CSRP2 expression promote cell-cycle
progression: CSRP2-OE cells in S and G2/M phases
increased substantially compared with control cells

Bio-informatic analyses showed CSRP2 high expressing

CSRP2 knock-down increases drug-sensitivity

CSRP2 expression in BV173 cells eliminated their
migration (Figure 6B).

Drug resistance is the main reason for treatmentfailure and relapse in B-cell ALL. We studied the
relationship between CSRP2 transcript levels and
B-cell ALL sensitivity to dexamethasone, methotrexate,
daunorubicin, cytarabine and imatinib (in BV173 with
BCR-ABL1). CSRP2-KD BV173 cells showed increased
sensitivity to dexamethasone, methotrexate, daunorubicin
and imatinib compared with controls (Figure 8A) whereas
CSRP2-OE Ramos cells showed increased resistance to
these drugs compared with controls (Figure 8B). These
data suggest down-regulation of CSRP2 may improve
therapy-outcomes in adult B-cell ALL.

Subcellular localization of CSRP2 in neoplastic
B-cells
We used cell fractionation analyses to assess
subcellular localization of CSRP2 in neoplastic B-cells.
CSRP2 protein was detected in the cytoplasm (C)
and nucleus (N) and was more intense in the latter
(Figure 7A). Silencing CSRP2 slightly decreased nuclear
CSRP2 localization in BV173 cells whereas overexpression slightly increased nuclear localization in
Ramos cells (Figure 7B).

DISCUSSION

high expression of CSRP2 [18]. Our analyses of the
prognostic impact of CSRP2 transcript levels on CIR
and RFS in adults with B-cell ALL was complex because
of confounding with other prognostic variables and
therapies. We used multivariate analyses to help resolve
this complexity. CIR and RFS of subjects receiving
transplants from different donors were similar so these
data were combined. We found a positive MRD-test at
the end of induction therapy, male sex, MLL translocation
and chemotherapy-only were independently-associated
with a higher CIR and worse RFS whereas other variables
including age, WBC, BCR-ABL1, IKZF1 deletion and
CSRP2 transcript levels were not. We discuss lack of a
significant association between BCR-ABL1 and CIR
and RFS previously [35]. Although high CSRP2 mRNA
expression was associated with CIR in univariate analyses
this association was not significant in multivariate
analyses possibly reflecting confounding by high levels

We used bioinformatics-based analyses to identify
potentially important genes transcribed in B-cell ALL. We
focused on CSRP2 because it was the most differentially
expressed gene in our studies. CSRP2 is a possible
oncogene in hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer
[17, 18]. CSRP1 belongs to the CSRP family and is
considered a tumor suppressor gene in hepatocellular
carcinoma and colorectal cancer [32, 33] but a possible
oncogene in gastric cancer [34]. In this study, we found
CSRP2 transcripts were uniformly low in bone marrow
mononuclear cells from normals whereas transcript levels
were high in cells from adults with newly-diagnosed
B-cell ALL.
An in silico analyses using publicly available
gene expression datasets reported worse survival of
women with the basal-like subtype of breast cancer with

of CSRP2 expression in persons with MLL translocation.
Consequently, we re-analyzed an association between
CSRP2 transcript levels, CIR and RFS in subjects with
normal cytogenetics. In multivariate regression analyses
high levels of CSRP2 transcripts were independentlyassociated with a higher CIR and worse RFS regardless of
post-remission therapy.
In several experimental models of B-cell ALL
increased CSRP2 transcription promotes cell proliferation,
migration and cell-cycle progression, a finding concordant
with our bio-informatic analyses. Increased CSRP2
transcription also promotes migration of breast cancer
cells via an actin bundling factor [18]. In our study CSRP2
was found predominantly in the nucleus. This contrasts
with the cytoskeletal localization reported in breast cancer
cells [18]. Moreover, knockdown of CSRP2 transcription
increased drug-sensitivity whereas increased CSRP2
transcription increased drug resistance. These data suggest
down-regulating CSRP2 transcription might decrease
drug resistance and thereby decrease CIR and improve
RFS. These conclusions are preliminary but warrant
consideration.
There are several limitations to our study which
was retrospective and susceptible to selection biases. The
cohort with normal cytogenetics was not pre-specified and
had relatively few subjects. Also, there is the potential for
an interaction between CSRP2 transcript levels and type
of post-remission therapy. Because of these limitations
our conclusion need validation in a larger, independent
prospective cohort. If validated, determination of
CSRP2 transcript levels in adult B-cell ALL with normal
cytogenetics might inform therapy-decisions. Also,
consideration could be given to down-regulating CSRP2
expression as a way to reverse drug resistance.

Burkitt lymphoma cell line Ramos was a kind gift from
Professor H.S. Zhao (Peking University Health Science
Center, Beijing, China). The human T-cell ALL cell
lines 6T-CEM and MOLT4, the human AML cell lines
KG-1, NB4 and HL60, the human chronic myelogenous
leukemia cell line K562 and the human lymphoma cell
lines MAVER, U937, Raji and MOLP2 were available in
our laboratory. Cell lines were cultured in Roswell Park
Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Gibco, Billings,
MT, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco),
penicillin (100 U/ml, Gibco) and streptomycin (100 μg/
ml, Gibco). Cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified 5%
CO2 atmosphere.

Subjects
Bone marrow samples were obtained from adults
with B-cell ALL (N = 236) and normals (N = 43) at the
Hematology Department of Peking University People’s
Hospital, Beijing, China and CSRP2 transcript levels
assessed. Complete clinical and laboratory data were
available for 168 subjects enrolled December, 2008 to
June, 2014. Subjects were followed until death, loss to
follow-up or June, 2016. The study was approved by
the Ethics Committee of Peking University People’s
Hospital and informed consent was obtained according
to the Declaration of Helsinki. Details of treatment
regimens are reported [35]. 92 subjects (55%) received an
allotransplant, 28 from an HLA-identical sibling, 1 from
an HLA-matched-unrelated donor and 63 from HLAhaplotype-matched related donors [36, 37]. Complete
remission, refractory disease, relapse and risk-stratification
were defined as described [2]. Relapse-free survival (RFS)
was determined from the date of first complete remission
to the date of first relapse. Cumulative incidence of relapse
(CIR) was determined from the date of first complete
remission to the date of first relapse or death in complete
remission.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bioinformatics analyses

Immune phenotype, measureable residual
disease (MRD) and cytogenetic analyses

To identify possible B-cell ALL relevant genes data
from the ImmuSort database dataset related to B-cell ALL
and normal B-cell samples was updated and re-analyzed
[9]. This database included gene expression profiles
from >20,000 genes in human and mouse immune cells
based on micro-array platform. Differences (delta values)
in average rank score (ARS) were transformed from
expressional signal value reflecting gene expression
intensity. These data were used for gene expression
comparison [9]. When a gene had multiple probe sets the
probe with the maximum ARS was used.

Bone marrow samples were analyzed using
standard four-color flow cytometry (FCM) [38]. Immune
phenotypes were identified as: (1) early precursor B-cell
ALL (pro-B-ALL) for CD10-negative, CD19-postive,
cCD79a-postive, cCD22 positive and TdT-positive; (2)
common B-cell ALL (common-B-ALL) for CD10-postive;
and (3) precursor B-cell ALL (pre-B-ALL) for cytoplasmic
μ+, sIg-, CD10+/- [2]. MRD was quantified by analyzing
leukemia-associated aberrant immune phenotypes (LAIPs)
using four-color flow cytometry as described [39]. A
positive MRD-test was defined as ≥ 0.1% of cells with an
LAIP phenotype in ≥ 1 bone marrow samples. Cytogenetic
analyses were performed by G-banding [40]. BCR-ABL1
transcripts and MLL rearrangements were detected

Cell lines

with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(RT-qPCR) [41, 42]. IKZF1 deletions were detected as
described [35].

Western blotting was done as described [47].
Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were extracted as
described [48]. The first antibodies were anti-CSRP2
(rabbit monoclonal, 1:1000; Abcum, Cambridge, UK) and
anti-GAPDH (rabbit monoclonal, 1:1000; Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA, USA) and the second antibody, horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

Lentiviral transduction
BV173 cells were infected with human CSRP2
shRNA lentiviral particles (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA) or blank control lentiviral particles (Santa Cruz)
at a 100 multiplicity of infection (MOI). Media containing
lentiviral particles were replaced with complete medium
12 h post-infection and stably transfected BV173 cells
were selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin dihydrochloride
(Genechem, Shanghai, China) at 96 h post-infection. Ramos
cells were infected with human CSRP2 lentiviral activation
particles (Santa Cruz) or control lentiviral activation
particles (Santa Cruz) at a 100 MOI. Stably transfected
Ramos cells were selected with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin
dihydrochloride (Genechem), 15 μg/ml Blasticidin S HCl™
(Solarbio, Beijing, China) and 2000 μg/ml Hygromycin
B™ (Solarbio). CSRP2 expression levels were confirmed
by RT-qPCR and western blot analyses.

Cell-cycle analyses
Cells were seeded to 6-well plates and starved by
adding serum-free medium for G1 synchronization. After
24 hours, medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was
added for an additional 48 hours. Cells were fixed in 75%
ethanol, stained with propidium iodide (BD Pharmingen,
San Jose, CA, USA) and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Results were analyzed with ModFit LT2.0 software
(Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL, USA).

Cell proliferation and viability assay

RNA preparation and RT-qPCR

Cell proliferation was determined with the Cell
Counting Kit-8 (CCK8, Dojin Laboratories, Kumamoto,
Japan) assay. Briefly, 4 × 10E+4 cells were seeded into
each well of 96-well plates. 2, 4 or 7 d later 10 μl of
the kit reagent was added to each well and 2 h later all
plates were scanned by a microplate reader at 450 nm.
CCK8 was also used to determine cell viability after
drug exposures including daunorubicin, dexamethasone,
methotrexate, cytarabine and imatinib (Solarbio, Beijing,
China). Cells were seeded and 72 h later 10 μl of the kit
reagent was added to each well and 2 h later plates were
scanned by a microplate reader at 450 nm. Cell viability
was assessed based on the value of fluorescent signal
of live cells with no drug treatment. Experiments were
performed in triplicate for 3 times independently.

Mononuclear cells were isolated from bone
marrow samples by Ficoll-Hypaque™ density gradient
centrifugation and RNA extracted using the TRIzol™
technique (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions and cDNA synthesized as
described [43]. mRNA expression levels were analyzed
using SYBR® green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA) to validate differential expression screened
out by bioinformatics analyses with ABL1 or GAPDH
as internal controls [44]. Gene transcript levels were
determined using the 2-ΔΔCt method. Average gene transcript
levels in bone marrow samples from normals were used
as calibrator. Other mRNA levels were determined by
the TaqMan® method [45]. CSRP2 transcript levels were
normalized to ABL1 expression as recommended by the
Europe Against Cancer group [46]. Copy numbers of
CSRP2 and ABL1 were calculated from standard curves
using the Ct values. Samples were assayed in duplicate
to evaluate data reproducibility and average threshold Ct
values calculated for expression analyses. Serial dilutions
of plasmids expressing ABL1 and CSRP2-positive bone
marrow specimens were amplified to construct standard
quantification curves [41]. These curves indicated similar
amplification efficiency for ABL1 and CSRP2 with slopes
of −3.50 and −3.49. Detection sensitivity was approximately
1–10 copies in the plasmid DNA standards and 10E5 in CSRP2-positive bone marrow samples. For each
measurement the curve threshold amplification was set at
0.08 for ABL1 and CSRP2. Primers and probe sequences are
shown in Supplementary Table 2.

Colony formation assays
Cells were suspended in 1 mL of complete
MethoCult™ medium and plated in 6 well plates at
a concentration of 4 × 10E+3 /well. Colonies were
maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity for
7 d and then counted and scored at day 7 after staining
with 1% crystal violet (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Only
colonies of ≥ 50 cells were scored. Assays were done in
triplicate for 3 times independently.

Cell migration assay
Cells were seeded into the upper chamber of
a Transwell insert (pore size, 8 μm) in RPMI-1640
supplemented with 1% FBS. The upper chamber was then
35996

placed into the Transwell containing medium with 10%
FBS in the lower chamber. After 24 h, cells remaining in
the lower surface of the insert were stained with crystal
violet. Experiments were conducted in triplicate for 3
times independently.

Tumor xenograft mouse model
Male athymic 6-week-old Balb/c nude mice (Beijing
HFK Bioscience Co., Ltd.; Beijing, China) were housed in a
controlled environment with a 12 h light/dark cycle at 23°C
(± 2°C) and 40–50% relative humidity with free access to
chow and water. Animal experiments were approved by
the Animal Ethics Committee of Peking University Health
Science Center. Mice were pretreated by intraperitoneal
injections of cyclophosphamide once daily at a dose of
100 mg/kg for 2 consecutive days. Two days later, Ramos
cells (1.5×10E+7 cells in 0.1 mL PBS) transduced with a
lentivirus containing CSRP2 lentiviral activation particles
or control lentiviral activation particles were injected
subcutaneously into the dorsal right flank of 6-week-old male
Balb/c nude mice (5 mice/group). Tumor diameters were
measured every 2 days until day15. Tumor volume (mmE+3)
was estimated by measuring the longest and shortest diameter
of the tumor as described [49]. Mice were euthanized on day
15 and tumors surgically removed and photographed.

Statistical analyses

The authors declare that they have no conflicts of
interest.

Differences across groups were compared using
the Pearson Chi-square analysis or Fisher exact test for
categorical data and Mann-Whitney U test or Student t-test
for continuous variables. Receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the predictive
power of transcript levels for diagnosis of B-cell ALL. The
Youden Index was used to calculate optimal cutoff points
for gene transcript levels in diagnosis of B-cell ALL [50].
Survival functions were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
method and compared by the log-rank test. Cumulative
incidences were estimated for relapse to accommodate
competing risks. A Cox proportional hazard regression
model was used to determine associations between CSRP2
transcript levels and CIR and RFS. Variables with P > 0.1
were sequentially excluded from the model and those with
a P < 0.05 considered significant. A two-sided P < 0.05
was considered significant. Analyses were performed by
SPSS software version 18.0 (Chicago, IL, USA), Graphpad
Prism™ 5.01 (San Diego, California, USA), OriginPro 9.2
(Wellesley Hills, MA, USA), SAS 9.4 software (SAS, Cary,
