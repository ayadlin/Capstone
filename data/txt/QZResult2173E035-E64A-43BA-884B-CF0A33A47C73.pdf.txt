BACKGROUND. Quality-of-life instruments that measure specific functional consequences of mucositis are needed to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions targeted against mucositis and to guide patient care. The authors
undertook a prospective, multicenter, observational study to assess the validity,
reliability, and feasibility of a new instrument, the Oral Mucositis Weekly Questionnaire-Head and Neck Cancer (OMWQ-HN). The OMWQ-HN is a patientreported outcome questionnaire that measures the symptoms of mucositis,
including mouth and throat soreness (MTS), and their impact on patient wellbeing and function.

METHODS. The OMWQ-HN, along with the Functional Assessment of Cancer
Therapy-Head and Neck (FACT-HN), was administered 5 times over an approxi-

portive care measures also was collected.

RESULTS. Seventy-five patients were enrolled and completed 93% of scheduled
reliability (correlation coefficient, 0.80–0.89). Cross-sectional analyses to assess
validity showed that OMWQ-HN scores were different across levels of pain, with
correlations were observed between OMWQ-HN and FACT-HN. Patients experienced increases in MTS, which corresponded with a steady decline in function.
MTS scores were highest in the patients who were taking opioid analgesics, suggesting that mucositis pain continued despite standard pain therapy.

CONCLUSIONS. The current results indicated that the OMWQ-HN is a valid, reliable, and feasible instrument for assessing the impact of mucositis on patients
who are receiving radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy for HNC.

ing, dose-limiting, and dose-delaying acute toxicity.1–4
Pain from OM can be severe, requiring opioid analgesics for pain management and substantially impairing
oropharyngeal function, nutritional intake, and oral
medication use. In search of improved cure rates,
combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy has become
standard therapy for advanced HNC.5,6 However, aggressive protocols have come at the expense of more
frequent and severe complications, with 60% of patients experiencing ulcerative OM.7–12
Extensive efforts are being made to prevent or
ameliorate OM.3,13,14 The first guidelines for the prevention and management of mucositis recently were
published.6 The first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agent for reducing the incidence and
duration of severe OM, palifermin, was introduced in
the United States in 2004.15 The product has been
approved for patients with hematologic malignancies
who are receiving myeloablative therapy that includes total body irradiation; and, currently, palifermin is under investigation in several solid tumor
disease settings. Standardized and validated tools to
assess and compare the impact of mucositis interventions on patient well-being and function will be
needed as additional indications for palifermin and
other agents emerge. There have been no instruments specifically designed to date that measure the
acute effects of mucositis.4,16–23
We conducted a multicenter, longitudinal study
to assess the validity, reliability, and feasibility of a
new mucositis instrument, the Oral Mucositis Weekly
Questionnaire-Head and Neck Cancer (OMWQ-HN).
The OMWQ-HN is a patient-reported outcome (PRO)
questionnaire that includes domains and questions
related to mucositis symptoms, including mouth and
throat soreness (MTS), and their impact on patient
well-being and function.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients who were receiving radiotherapy with or
without chemotherapy for HNC were recruited from
7 centers in the United States. The study protocol
was approved by institutional review boards of participating institutions. Eligibility criteria included: 1)
histologically confirmed diagnosis of carcinoma of
the oral cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx or neck disease (lymph node or soft
tissue) of unknown origin; 2) scheduled to receive
radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy; 3) age
18 years; 4) written informed consent; 5) able to
read and complete the questionnaires; and 6) not
receiving investigational agent for mucositis.

Questionnaires
The OMWQ-HN item content was refined through
qualitative research with 30 HNC patients (data on
file). In-depth, one-on-one interviews were undertaken to identify missing elements, to eliminate questions that were deemed irrelevant, and to rephrase
questions that were judged to be unclear from the
patients’ perspectives. The question that received the
lowest clarity rating was related to the type of diet
the patient experienced in the past 24 hours (on a
scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no oral intake
and 10 indicating solid foods); 23% of patients rated
this question unclear or difficult to understand. The
effect of OM on the ability to wear dentures and
questions related to diarrhea scored low on relevance, with approximately 50% of participants rating
the relevance of these questions as 1 or 2, with 1
indicating not at all relevant. The revised OMWQHN, which was based on the findings of the qualitative study, was the subject of the current investigation. The revised OMWQ-HN, along with companion
instruments, is described below.

The OMWQ-HN
The OMWQ-HN is a mucositis-specific questionnaire
that is similar to a OM daily questionnaire (OMDQ)
that was used in a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
for patients who were receiving myeloablative therapy and undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).15 In the transplantation setting,
MTS-related questions of the OMDQ were valid, reliable, and responsive measures of OM severity that
were correlated closely with and predictive of objective assessments of OM using the World Health Organization grading scale.24 The OMWQ-HN consists of
12 items that assess patient well-being and function.
The time frame for reference is the past week. All
questions use a Likert-type response format. The first
2 questions assess global health and quality of life
(QOL) and are taken from the European Organization
for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life
Questionnaire25; the questions are rated on a 7-point
scale, with 1 indicating very poor and 7 indicating
excellent: 1) How would you rate your overall health
during the past week? 2) How would you rate your
overall QOL during the past week?
The third question quantifies MTS the patient is
experiencing on a 5-point scale, with 0 indicating no
soreness and 4 indicating extreme soreness: 3) How
much MOUTH AND THROAT SORENESS did you experience in the past week? If the patient marks 0,
then he or she is instructed to stop; and, if soreness
is >0, then the remaining 4 questions are completed.

1916

The fourth question, which is made up of 6
items, addresses the impact of MTS on patient function and includes a 5-point scale, with 0 indicating
not limited and 4 indicating unable to do: 4) How
much did MOUTH AND THROAT SORENESS limit
you in each of the following activities during the past
week: 1) sleeping, 2) swallowing, 3) drinking, 4) eating, 5) talking, 6) brushing your teeth?
The remaining 3 questions assess the degree of
mouth and throat pain and soreness using an 11point scale, with 0 indicating no pain or soreness and
10 indicating the worst pain or soreness imaginable
or possible: 5) On a scale from 0 to 10, how would
you rate your OVERALL MOUTH AND THROAT
SORENESS during the past week? 6) On a scale from
0 to 10, what number best describes the MOUTH
PAIN that you have experienced in the past week? 7)
On a scale from 0 to 10, what number best describes
the THROAT PAIN that you have experienced in the
past week?

The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and
Neck Cancer
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
(FACT)-Head and Neck Cancer (FACT-HN) includes
the FACT-General (FACT-G) and an HNC-specific
additional-concerns subscale (HNCS).26 The FACT-G
has 4 subscales: physical well-being (PWB) (7 items),
social/family well-being (SWB) (7 items), emotional
well-being (EWB) (6 items), and functional wellbeing (FWB) (7 items). The modified version of the
HNCS that was used in this study consisted of 8 of
the 9 typically scored HNCS items. The item that was
not used (I eat solid foods) was evaluated more thoroughly in the Performance Status Scale for Head and
Neck Cancer (PSS-HN). The FACT-HN Symptom
Index (FHNSI) is comprised of 10 items from the
FACT-HN that have been selected by expert providers
as the most important symptom targets when treating patients with advanced HNC.27 A modified 8item version of the FHNSI that excluded I eat solid
foods and I have pain in my mouth, throat, or neck
also was administered. All items have a Likert-type
response scale (ranging from 0 [not at all] to 4 [very
much]). Item responses on negatively worded items
were reversed, and subscale and total scores were
calculated as described in the FACT-HN scoring
guidelines.26–31 A higher score indicates better QOL
on all FACT-HN subscales and total scores.
The PSS-HN
The PSS-HN is a clinician-rated scale that has been
validated previously to assess 3 domains of performance status for patients with HNC: Normalcy of Diet,

Public Eating, and Understandability of Speech.29
The Normalcy of Diet scale ranges from 0 to 100 and
is divided into 10-point increments. A lower score
indicates more impairment, with 0 indicating full
impairment, nonoral feeding (tube fed), and 100 indicating no impairment, full diet (no restrictions).
The FACT-HN and PSS-HN were included alongside the OMWQ-HN as tools to validate the OMWQHN. Specifically, the question related to pain from
the FACT-HN (I have pain) and the scale related to
the ability to eat from the PSS-HN (Normalcy of
Diet) served as anchors in the analyses. These
anchors were chosen based on previous literature
showing that pain is the hallmark symptom of mucositis, and inability to eat is one of the most important
mucositis-related functional impairments.

Study Design and Sample
Seventy-five patients were enrolled in this prospective, longitudinal, multicenter, observational study of
patients with HNC who were receiving radiotherapy
with or without chemotherapy. The questionnaires
were administered prior to treatment (Week 0) and
at Weeks 2, 4, and 6. During Week 4, the questionnaires were administered twice 24 to 48 hours apart
for test-retest reliability evaluation. During Weeks 2,
4, and 6, patients and a physician or nurse separately
recorded their perceptions of change, if any, in MTS
compared with previous assessments. Patients completed the questionnaires in the physician’s office or
at the radiation therapy clinic. Upon completion, the
study coordinator/nurse reviewed the questionnaires
for completeness. Demographic, disease, and treatment data were collected at baseline and are
reported in Table 1. Opioid analgesic use and feeding
tube use were recorded throughout the study.
Statistical Analysis
Cronbach a coefficients were calculated at each
assessment to assess internal consistency, and Spearman correlation coefficients (r) were calculated
between items of the OMWQ-HN. Removal of items
from the OMWQ-HN was considered to balance the
desire to maximize a coefficients across assessments
and to retain content validity. Based on this analysis,
a scoring algorithm was written, and the final scale
created from this process was used in all subsequent
analyses of the OMWQ-HN. Intraclass correlation
coefficients were computed to measure the test-retest reliability of the OMWQ-HN, the FACT-HN, and
the PSS-HN using the consecutive Week-4 assessments.29 We also examined the patient and clinician
perceptions of change in MTS between the 2 assessments at Week 4 to ensure that substantial clinical

change had not occurred during that period, which
would distort the test-retest analyses.
Assessment of cross-sectional validity primarily
focused on differentiating definable groups according
to responses to the pain question from the FACT-HN
and the use of opioid analgesics. Differences in
mean scores across groups of patients were assessed
using analyses of variance (ANOVA) and 2-sample t
tests. Effect sizes (difference between means/common standard deviation [SD]) were calculated for
these group comparisons to provide an indication of
the clinical significance of group differences.30,31 The
associations between the OMWQ-HN, the FACT-HN,
and the PSS-HN scales were evaluated at each
assessment using Spearman correlation coefficients.
To demonstrate the sensitivity of the OMWQ-HN to

1917

detect change, changes in the Normalcy of Diet scale
of the PSS-HN and the pain item of the FACT-HN
were used to form 3 independent groups (better, no
change, worse). Mean changes from baseline in the
OMWQ-HN were compared between groups using an
ANOVA. Both distribution and anchor-based methods were used to identify minimally important differences (MIDs) for the OMWQ-HN and FACT-HN
scales. Distribution-based methods included 0.33
and 0.50 SD and the standard error of measurement
pﬃﬃﬃ
(SEM ¼ SD* a[1-reliability]). The anchor-based approach involved examination of the mean change scores
for patients that reported that they were a little better
or a little worse compared with their last assessment.
Feasibility was assessed by calculating the percentage of scheduled assessments completed and the
percentage of patients who responded to individual
items of each questionnaire. SAS software (version
8.02; SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC) was used for all
analyses.

RESULTS
Ninety-three percent (348 of 375) of scheduled
assessments were completed (100% at Week 0). Of a
potential 359 assessments for patients who remained
on study, 7 assessments (2%) were missed because of
administrative error, and another 4 assessments (1%)
were missed because of patient refusal. Seven
patients (9%) withdrew from the study after completion of the baseline assessment (1 death, 1 hospitalization, and 5 patient refusals).
The Cronbach a coefficient for all 12 OMWQ-HN
items was 0.912 at Week 4; however, the overall
health and overall QOL items and the brushing teeth
item had low item-total correlations at all assessments (generally <0.5) relative to the other OMWQHN items (generally >0.7). The overall health and
overall QOL items were correlated highly with each
other (r ¼ 0.72–0.81) but were correlated only moderately with the other MTS-related items (r ¼ 0.2–
0.5). There were strong correlations (>0.7) among
the MTS-related items, including mouth pain and
throat pain. Based on these findings, a summary
OMWQ-HN score was calculated as the sum of the
responses of the items excluding overall health, overall QOL, and limits brushing teeth. That score was
used in the remaining analyses and is referred to as
the OMWQ-HN scale.
Descriptive statistics are shown in Table 2 for the
OMWQ-HN, FACT-HN, and PSS-HN Normalcy of
Diet scales at baseline and at subsequent assessments. Test-retest reliabilities of most scales ranged
from 0.80 to 0.89. Results of the cross-sectional anal-

yses to assess validity, using Week 4 data, are shown
in Table 3. Week 4 was chosen, because it captures a
time by which there has been onset of mucositis,
and the data quality still was excellent. Results from
other time points did not differ significantly. The
OMWQ-HN scores clearly were different across levels
of pain at Week 4, with patients in the worst pain
category exhibiting the highest OMWQ-HN scores.
Effect sizes in the range from 0.2 to 0.5 are considered MIDs in the measurement of health-related
QOL; the observed effect sizes exceeded these criteria. Patients who were taking opioid analgesics had
significantly worse OMWQ-HN scores than patients
who were not taking opioid analgesics at Week 4,
and the observed effect sizes exceeded 0.5.
The associations between the OMWQ-HN, FACTHN, and PSS-HN scales were assessed using Spearman
correlation coefficients at Week 4. There were strong
correlations, as expected, between the OMWQ-HN and
the FACT-HNCS (h ¼ 0.57), the FHNSI (q ¼ 0.63),
the FACT PWB (h ¼ 0.66), and the FACT FWB
(h ¼ 0.48). The OMWQ-HN was correlated weakly
with the FACT SWB (h ¼ 0.16) but was correlated
rather highly with the FACT EWB (h ¼ 0.52). Correlations between the OMWQ-HN and the PSS-HN scales
were lower than expected (h range ¼ 0.09 for Understandability of Speech to 0.37 for Public Eating). Figure 1 shows the strikingly similar longitudinal patterns
for the OMWQ-HN and the 2 symptom-focused, validated endpoints from the FACT-HN: HNCS and FHNSI.
To demonstrate sensitivity to detect change in QOL
during treatment, changes in the pain item of the
FACT-HN and Normalcy of Diet scale of the PSS-HN
were used to form 3 independent groups (better, no
change, worse). Because the numbers of patients that
improved were quite small for both pain and Normalcy

group were small (0.06–0.17). The mean OMWQ-HN
change score for the patients who reported being a
little worse ranged from 4.3 to 9.5 for Weeks 2, 4, and
6. Across 4 assessments, 0.33 SD units of the
OMWQ-HN (possible score range, 0–54) ranged from
3.6 to 4.8, and 0.50 SD units of the OMWQ-HN ranged from 5.4 to 7.2. Combining the distributionbased and anchor-based information on OMWQ-HN
performance, it is reasonable to estimate an MID
range from 4 to 7. For group comparisons, the lower
bound of the MID range may be applied; and, for
individual classification, the higher end may be used.
Thus, a group difference over time of 4 points
(approximately 0.33 SD) likely would reflect a meaningful treatment effect, and a 7-point change
(approximately 0.5 SD) would provide reasonable
confidence in classifying an individual as having
changed from baseline.
Across the study period, patients experienced
increases in MTS that corresponded with a steady

of Diet, the better and no change categories were combined. Means, SDs, t statistics, and P values for the
OMWQ-HN and MTS are shown in Table 4. For both
grouping criteria, the better/no change and worse
groups differed significantly on both scale scores.
MID estimates focused primarily on the groups
of patients who worsened, because very few patients
reported being a little better, and effect sizes for this

The current results indicate that the OMWQ-HN is a
valid, reliable, and feasible instrument for measuring
the impact of mucositis in patients who are receiving
radiation therapy, with or without chemotherapy for
HNC. The OMWQ-HN captured dramatic changes
throughout the course of radiation therapy.
The final OMWQ-HN scale included 9 items.
Three items were removed from the initial questionnaire (overall health, overall QOL, and the effects of
MTS on brushing teeth) because of low item-total
correlations at all assessments. The finding that overall health and QOL were correlated poorly with items
related to mucositis is consistent with some studies,
which showed that changes in specific patient morbidities or symptoms were not reflected in global
measures of health or QOL.16,17,32 Brushing teeth also
had the highest level of nonresponse in the OMWQHN scale. We did not control for the use of prostheses or the presence or absence of teeth, which
may have affected this variable.
The measurement properties of the OMWQ-HN
scale were strong with internal-consistency reliability
coefficients that exceeded acceptable standards at all
time points. The OMWQ-HN scale successfully differentiated patients who had different levels of pain,
and patients who reported more pain also had worse
OMWQ-HN scores. Furthermore, patients who were
taking opioid analgesics also had significantly worse

OMWQ-HN scores than patients who were not taking
opioid analgesics. The OMWQ-HN demonstrated
responsiveness to change in clinical status over time,
successfully differentiating patients who reported
worsening versus no change or improvement in their
status across levels of pain and the Normalcy of Diet
scale of the PSS-HN. Convergent validity of the
OMWQ-HN, FACT-HN, and FHNSI scales also was
demonstrated. Coefficients were high, suggesting the
OMWQ-HN measures a similar construct, but not
too high, indicating that the OMWQ-HN is not
redundant with the other tools.
Greater than 90% of scheduled assessments were
completed. There were few missed assessments
because of administrative error, and those that were
missed were distributed evenly throughout the study,
minimizing potential for missing bias. For completed
questionnaires, patients provided responses to nearly
all items. These compliance figures are particularly

noteworthy, because the questionnaires were administered 5 times over a 6-week treatment period, the
majority of patients received aggressive therapy, and
the number of items at each assessment totaled >50.
Our study reflects the morbidity associated with
mucositis in patients who are receiving radiation
with or without chemotherapy for HNC. Mean MTS
increased throughout the course of study and
approached a score of 3 or 4 (extreme soreness) in
the last weeks of treatment (Fig. 2, top). A doubling
of patient symptoms occurred in the first 2 weeks of
treatment, and almost a tripling was observed at 4
weeks. The impact of MTS was greatest with eating,
swallowing, and drinking (Fig. 2, bottom). It is noteworthy that patients who had worse OMWQ-HN
scores also were prescribed opioid analgesics. These
results suggest that, despite the use of potent pain
medications, patients with HNC still suffer from
symptoms of mucositis. There were no significant
differences in OMWQ-HN scores or single-item ratings of mouth and throat soreness between patients
with and without a feeding tube. Although the current study was not powered to test differences
between patient treatment groups, we did compare
patients who received radiotherapy alone (n ¼ 24
patients) versus patients who received radiotherapy
plus concurrent chemotherapy (n ¼ 41) and patients
who received radiotherapy plus concurrent and
induction chemotherapy (n ¼ 10 patients), and we
observed no significant differences between groups,
although the sample sizes were small. Patients with
tumors of the larynx were compared with all other
patients, and no significant differences were observed. Men were affected disproportionately in the
population by the tumor sites under study (81% vs
19%); however, there were no significant differences
between men and women.
We undertook the current study because of the
lack of a specific and parsimonious PRO tool to measure the impact of mucositis symptoms on patients
with HNC. Such a simple and specific tool may be
useful not only for assessing and comparing the
effects of mucositis interventions in an RCT setting
but also in clinical practice to communicate with
patients about what they are experiencing and to
identify additional supportive care or treatment
changes that may be required.
In results that were published from a pivotal
RCT in patients who underwent HSCT in which the
daily version of the OMWQ-HN instrument was
used, patients reported onset, peak, and resolution of
oral pain/soreness earlier by an average 1 to 3 days
than the respective changes observed by clinicians.33
Because observer assessments often are made during

Evaluation of OMWQ-HN/Epstein et al.

a visit to the clinic or during hospitalization, the
observations may not be sensitive enough to capture
accurately daily changes in the severity of OM and
its accompanying consequences. Further studies of
time to onset of patient-reported MTS scores compared with observer-graded mucositis assessments in
HNC currently are under investigation.
Noteworthy in this study was the greater sensitivity to change of the OMWQ-HN from baseline to
Week 2 (Fig. 1) compared with FACT-HN and FHNSI
scores. The OMWQ-HN and MTS scores more than
double during the first 2 weeks, as opposed to a
much more modest change among the other QOL
scores (Table 1). These results suggest that the
OMWQ-HN is more responsive than less symptomfocused QOL instruments in detecting early changes
in symptoms related to OM.
A limitation of this study was that we did not
include a standardized clinical anchor, such as an
objective, clinician-rated assessment of OM. We
chose to use a patient assessment alone based on
recent reports that symptoms associated with mucositis, including oropharyngeal pain and pain on swallowing, were relevant clinically and were correlated
highly with objective assessments.34–36 Some clinicians
also recently argued that a patient assessment of the
impact of mucositis may be more useful than objective findings upon oral examination.35 Nevertheless,
the relation between objective and subjective findings
is an important step in the validation of the OMWQHN scale and is being assessed in an ongoing RCT.
The results from this study show that the
OMWQ-HN is valid, reliable, readily applied in a
multicenter trial to assess acute changes associated
with treatment, and responsive to change throughout
treatment. This study adds to the prior experience of
QOL evaluation and specific oral function/symptom
scales in patients with HNC.
