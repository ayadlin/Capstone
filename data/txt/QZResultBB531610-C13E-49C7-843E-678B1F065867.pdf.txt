Abstract
Although hypoxia-inducible factor-1A (HIF-1A) has long been
intensively investigated as a drug target by interfering with its
expression or transcriptional function, the regulatory mechanisms of HIF-1A remain to be further clarified. We report
here that c-Jun associates with HIF-1A via its oxygendependent degradation domain, masks the sites for ubiquitination, and thus protects HIF-1A from proteasome-executing
degradation. All of these together resulted in the stabilization
and accumulation of HIF-1A, consequently promoting the
transcription of its target gene and driving angiogenesisrelated events. The stabilization of HIF-1A was dependent on
the domains of c-Jun for DNA binding and heterodimerization
but independent of the Ser63/73 phosphorylation that is critical
for transcriptional function. These findings highlight a
previously unrecognized nontranscriptional function of c-Jun
on the one hand and a distinct regulatory mechanism of HIF1A activity on the other, consequently offering profound
mechanistic insights into multiple events simultaneously
involving both c-Jun and HIF-1A in tumor progression.

Introduction
Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor that
drives neoangiogenesis in response to hypoxia in the progression of
solid tumors (1, 2). It is a heterodimer composed of an a subunit
(HIF-1a) and a constitutively expressed h subunit (HIF-1h; ref. 3).
The transcription activity of HIF-1 is dominantly determined by
HIF-1a in response to microenvironmental oxygenation (4). More
than 70 bona fide HIF-1a–regulated genes have been identified that
are widely involved in the malignant features of tumors, including
angiogenesis (5), invasion, metastasis (6), and drug resistance (7).
HIF-1a is overexpressed in the majority of malignant solid tumors
and is highly associated with low drug responsiveness and poor
clinical prognosis (8).
HIF-1a is regulated by various pathways at different levels (9).
Except for its own expression controlled by both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT (10, 11) and the mitogen-activated protein
kinase pathways (12), a ubiquitination-mediated proteasomeexecuting degradation pathway is the most important regulator of

the cellular HIF-1a level (13). The central event is that an oxygensensitive prolyl hydroxylase triggers the hydroxylation of HIF-1a
at its Pro402 and Pro564 residues (14, 15), facilitating its pVHLmediated ubiquitination at Lys532 (16). Then, the 26S proteasome
takes up the ubiquitinated HIF-1a for degradation (17, 18). In
addition to pVHL, several other factors have been reported to
affect HIF-1a ubiquitination and stability, such as p53, HSP90,
RACK1, and Jab1 (19–22).
c-Jun is a well-known transcription factor that functions as a
homodimer with itself or a heterodimer with other activator
protein-1 (AP-1) family members. It is involved in many cellular
processes, including the proliferation, transformation, differentiation, apoptosis, and stress-adaptive responses. c-Jun reportedly
cooperates with HIF-1a to activate the transcription of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and NDRG-1/Cap43 in a c-Jun
NH2-terminal kinase (JNK)–phosphorylated fashion (23, 24) and to
associate with HIF-1a to promote the transcription of the
multidrug resistance mdr1 gene under hypoxia (25). On the other
hand, c-Jun is also reported to be activated by HIF-1 under hypoxia
(26, 27). Despite recent rapid advances in understanding the
molecular contribution of c-Jun to the HIF-1a pathway in response
to hypoxia, important questions remain to be answered, for
example, the possible links between HIF-1a activation and the
c-Jun pathways, as well as the distinct mechanisms by which c-Jun
contributes to HIF-1a–mediated tumor responses.
In this report, we show for the first time that c-Jun associates
with HIF-1a via its oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain,
thus potentiating its transcriptional activity. This effect is mediated
by stabilization and hence protection of HIF-1a from proteasomeexecuted degradation, which, distinct from its well-recognized
transcriptional function, depends on the nontranscriptional
function of c-Jun.

Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. c-Jun small interfering RNA
(siRNA)-1 was in the form of c-Jun SMARTpool from Dharmacon; c-Jun
siRNA-2 targeting 5¶-GAUGGAAACGACCUUCUAUTT-3¶, c-Jun siRNA-3
targeting 5¶-CCUCAGCAACUUCAACCCATT-3¶, HIF-1a siRNA targeting
5¶-CUGAUGACCAGCAACUUGATT-3¶, and mock (scrambled) siRNA targeting 5¶-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3¶ were from GenePharma. Rabbit
IgG and mouse IgG were from Dingguo. Protein A/G agarose beads were
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Fluorescent secondary antibodies Alexa
Fluor were from Invitrogen. The VEGF-ELISA kit was from Jingmei. Matrigel
was from Becton Dickinson. All the expression plasmids of the wild-type
and mutated c-Jun were provided by Prof. Dirk Bohmann (University of
Rochester, Rochester, NY). The constructs of hemagglutinin (HA)-HIF-1a
(plasmid 18949; Addgene) and HA-HIF-1a (401D603) were kindly offered by
Prof. William G. Kaelin (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and Prof. H.
Franklin Bunn (Harvard Medical School), respectively.
Cell transfection. The transfection with siRNA was conducted with
Oligofectamine according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, the cells
were cultured in full medium for 48 h before being treated under hypoxic or
normoxic conditions.
To reexpress the wild-type or mutated c-Jun (Figs. 1 and 3), we first
knocked down c-Jun with c-Jun siRNA-2. Twenty-four hours after
transfection with the siRNA, the cells were transcultured in Opti-MEM
with no serum. Lipofectamine and 1 Ag of c-Jun plasmids were used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, the cells were cultured
in full medium for another 24-h period before being further treated.

Lipofectamine was also used to transfect the construction of HIF-1a and
HIF-1a (401D603) according to the manufacturer’s instructions 24 h before
being further treated.
Western blotting analyses. Cells were lysed in 1 SDS lysis buffer [50
mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mmol/L DTT, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol
blue, 10% glycerol] and then boiled for 5 to 10 min. Standard Western
blotting analyses were performed to measure the levels of cellular c-Jun and
HIF-1a.
Tube formation assays. Tube formation assays were conducted to
examine the effect of c-Jun silencing on the in vitro angiogenesis of HMEC-1
cells (28). Briefly, a 96-well plate was coated with 55 AL of Matrigel, which
was allowed to solidify at 37jC for 1 h. HMEC-1 cells (1.8  104 per well)
were seeded into Matrigel-coated 96-well plates and cultured in MCDB131
medium with 10% FBS under normoxic or hypoxic conditions for the
indicated times. The tube-like networks were photographed under a
microscope (IX70, Olympus). The perimeters of all the tubes were measured
for semiquantitative analyses.
Reverse transcription-PCR analyses. Cells were lysed with Trizol, and
total RNA was isolated with chloroform and isopropyl alcohol. RNA (1 Ag)
was subjected to reverse transcription with the RT Ace kit (Toyobo)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cDNA was amplified via
26-cycle PCR with Taq DNA polymerase and primers for VEGF (sense,
5¶-TCGGGCCTCCGAAACCATG-3¶; antisense, 5¶-CCTGGAGAGAGATCTGGTTC-3¶), c-Jun (sense, 5¶-AACGACCTTCTATGACGATGCCCTC3¶; antisense, 5¶-GCGAACCCCTCCTGCTCATCTGTC-3¶), HIF-1a (sense,

Figure 1. c-Jun knockdown leads to a decrease in
HIF-1a levels under persistent hypoxia. A, levels of HIF-1a
protein in c-Jun siRNA-1–transfected MDA-MB-468,
MDA-MB-435, and HeLa cells decreased significantly
under hypoxia for 6 h. Cells were transfected with c-Jun
siRNA-1 or mock siRNA and cultured for 48 h before
hypoxia treatment. B, treatments with both c-Jun
siRNA-2 and c-Jun siRNA-3 led to HIF-1a decrease in
MDA-MB-468 cells under hypoxia for 6 h. C, HIF-1a in
c-Jun siRNA-2–transfected MDA-MB-468 cells also
decreased in response to the treatment with CoCl2 for 6 h.
D, complementation with wild-type c-Jun rescued HIF-1a
decrease under hypoxia for 6 h. MDA-MB-468 cells
were transfected with the wild-type c-Jun plasmid 24 h
after c-Jun siRNA treatment. All the experiments above
were repeated at least thrice.

antisense, 5¶-GGTGAGGATCTTCATGAGGT-3¶). The PCR products were
analyzed with 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide for
visualization.
ELISA assays for VEGF secretion. To test the secreted VEGF, the
medium was replaced with 1 mL/well of fresh medium, and the cells were
subjected to hypoxia or normoxia for 12 h. Then, the cell supernatants were
collected, clarified by centrifugation at 1,000  g for 5 min, and stored at
20jC. The amount of VEGF in the supernatant was determined with a
VEGF-ELISA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
HIF-1A half-life assays. The MDA-MB-468 cells at 48 h after
transfection with c-Jun siRNA were preincubated under hypoxic conditions
for 2 h. Then, the cells were exposed to 100 Amol/L cycloheximide under
hypoxic conditions for the indicated time to block protein synthesis. The
cells were collected for Western blotting analyses.
Immunoprecipitation. Cells treated under hypoxic conditions for
6 h were collected for immunoprecipitation. Briefly, cells were lysed with
NP40 lysis buffer (Beyotime) for coimmunoprecipitation or with 0.1% SDS
lysis buffer (Beyotime) for immunoprecipitation. Followed by centrifugation, the supernatant was precleared with 20 AL protein A/G agarose beads
coupled with mouse or rabbit IgG for >2 h and then was exposed to 20 AL
protein A/G agarose beads coupled with the indicated antibodies for >6 h.
The beads were washed thrice with 1 mL NP40 lysis buffer or PBS for
20 min each. The precipitants were dissolved with the SDS loading buffer
for Western blotting analyses.
Cell immunofluorescence. Cells (0.5  105) were seeded onto coverslips
in 24-well plates and exposed to hypoxia for 6 h. Then, the cells were rinsed
with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, and permeabilized with
0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Next, the cells were washed with PBS
and 3% bovine serum albumin (blocking reagent) for 20 min. After that, the
cells were sequentially incubated with diluted primary antibodies for 1 h,
washed thrice with PBS, and incubated with fluorescent secondary
antibodies for 30 min. Finally, the coverslips were washed with PBS for
examination under Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope.
Sequence-based protein partner searches. The probabilities of the
direct interactions between c-Jun and HIF-1a or its deletion mutants were
analyzed with the program sequence-based protein partner search (SPPS)
supported by the Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of
Materia Medica (29). The system is open to the public.1 Click ‘‘Query Two,’’
choose ‘‘Human Being’’ for database, and submit the sequences of the
protein partners (Fig. 4). The results were sent to the submitter by email.
Densitometry and statistical analyses. The densitometry analyses for
Western blotting and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were conducted
using Adobe Photoshop CS2 version 9.0.2. The integrated absorbance value
(defined as each pixel value background value) was determined for the
equal-sized boxes drawn around the bands of HIF-1a and h-actin,
respectively, with the background values shown below each band of
interest. The protein levels of HIF-1a were calculated as the integrated
absorbance values of HIF-1a over those of h-actin and normalized as the
values of each group over that of the mock group. The Student’s t test was
used to assess the difference of the secreted VEGF or the tube formation of
HMEC-1 cells. P < 0.05 was defined as the level of statistical significance.

Results
c-Jun regulates cellular HIF-1A protein levels. We used a
specific c-Jun siRNA pool to knock down c-Jun expression in
human tumor cell lines, including MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-435,
and HeLa. When these c-Jun–silenced cells were exposed to 1% O2
for 6 hours, the levels of cellular HIF-1a protein were noted to be
far lower than those in the hypoxic control cells (Fig. 1A). Similar
results were obtained by transfecting two additional siRNAs

targeting distinct sequences of c-Jun into MDA-MB-468 cells
(Fig. 1B). Moreover, the same scenario has been observed in a
CoCl2-induced hypoxia-mimic system (Fig. 1C).
To test for a causal link between the reduction of c-Jun
expression and the decrease in cellular HIF-1a protein levels, we
conducted c-Jun complementation experiments by transfecting a
plasmid carrying a 5¶-end truncated wild-type c-Jun sequence
(Fig. 1D; ref. 30) into the c-Jun–silenced MDA-MB-468 cells. This
plasmid expresses functional c-Jun protein (30), but its transcripts
could not be disrupted by c-Jun siRNA-2 due to their 5¶-terminal
unpairing (Fig. 1D). c-Jun complementation effectively restored the
responsiveness of HIF-1a to hypoxia (Fig. 1D), indicating that c-Jun
plays a causal role in the control of cellular HIF-1a protein levels.
c-Jun protects HIF-1A from 26S proteasome–dependent
degradation. To examine whether c-Jun affects the transcription
of HIF-1a, we detected the levels of HIF-1a mRNA in the c-Jun–
silenced MDA-MB-468 cells. However, c-Jun knockdown did not
change the level of HIF-1a mRNA, indicating that c-Jun does not
contribute to the transcription of the HIF-1a gene (Fig. 2A).
Furthermore, c-Jun silencing failed to alter the levels of AKT (and)
or p42/44, which reportedly regulate the transcription and
translation of HIF-1a (Supplementary Fig. S1A; refs. 10–12).
Next, we characterized the alteration kinetics of the HIF-1a
protein levels in MDA-MB-468 cells transfected with mock or c-Jun
siRNA responding to hypoxia. In the control cells, the levels of
HIF-1a protein went up rapidly on exposure to 1% O2, peaked at
the 4-hour time point, stayed there for f2 hours, and then went
down slowly. In contrast, in the c-Jun–silenced cells, the levels of
HIF-1a protein reached the maximal value at the 2-hour time
point, then rapidly decreased, and went down to the basal level by
10 hours (Fig. 2B). Notably, the highest level of the HIF-1a protein
was not only much lower but it was lowered much earlier and
faster in the c-Jun–silenced cells than in the control cells. The data
suggest that a reduction in c-Jun is likely to impair the stability of
the HIF-1a protein.
To test this possibility, we determined the half-life of the HIF-1a
protein by the introduction of cycloheximide, a known protein
synthesis inhibitor. In c-Jun–silenced cells, the HIF-1a protein had
a 50% shorter half-life (15.7 minutes) than that (31.0 minutes) of the
control (Fig. 2C). To further examine whether the faster reduction
of HIF-1a protein in c-Jun–silenced cells is associated with its
proteasome-dependent degradation, we exposed the cells to the
26S proteasome inhibitors MG132 and epoxomicin and the calpain
inhibitor ALLN as a control. Both proteasome inhibitors rescued
the decline of HIF-1a levels induced by c-Jun silencing, whereas
the calpain inhibitor ALLN failed (Fig. 2D). All these findings
collectively indicate that c-Jun protected HIF-1a from proteasomeexecuted degradation.
c-Jun interacts with and stabilizes HIF-1A protein independent of its transcriptional function. We next addressed whether
the effect of c-Jun on the stability of HIF-1a is due to their
functional cooperation. We first conducted coimmunoprecipitation
and then confocal microscopy analyses. c-Jun was found to be
coimmunoprecipitated with HIF-1a protein in both of the tested
cell lines MDA-MB-468 and HeLa cells (Fig. 3A, top). Consistently,
c-Jun was also observed to be colocalized in the nuclei with the
HIF-1a protein in both cell lines (Fig. 3A, bottom).
c-Jun contains several critical functional regions, including the
Ser63/73 sites for phosphorylation, which is closely related to its
transcriptional activity (31), and also regions for DNA binding, JunFos dimerization, and homodimerization (Fig. 3B). To detect which

Figure 2. c-Jun prevents HIF-1a from ubiquitin-mediated degradation. A, RT-PCR analyses revealed that c-Jun silencing in MDA-MB-468 cells did not lower the
levels of HIF-1a mRNA under hypoxia for 6 h. B, silencing c-Jun with c-Jun siRNA-2 in MDA-MB-468 cells affected the kinetics of the HIF-1a protein when the cells were
exposed to hypoxic conditions. C, c-Jun silencing led to faster degradation of HIF-1a protein under hypoxia. Forty-eight hours after transfection with c-Jun siRNA-2
or mock siRNA, MDA-MB-468 cells were pretreated under hypoxia for 2 h followed by treatment with 100 Ag/mL cycloheximide (CHX ) to block protein synthesis
for the indicated times. The values of two siRNA treatment groups are represented by the triangles and squares, and the corresponding values in two independent
experiments are indicated by the solid and hollow symbols, respectively. The mean values from two experiments are connected by the lines. D, the 26S proteasome
inhibitors MG132 (10 Amol/L) and epoxomicin (EPX; 1 Amol/L) rescued the down-regulation of HIF-1a in the c-Jun siRNA-2–transfected MDA-MB-468 cells after
6-h exposure to hypoxia, whereas the calpain protease inhibitor ALLN (10 Amol/L) did not. All the experiments above were conducted thrice, except C . Data are the

region(s) contributes to the formation of the c-Jun–HIF-1a
complexes, we transfected a series of plasmids carrying different
c-Jun mutations (kindly gifted by Dr. Dirk Bohmann; Fig. 3B;
refs. 30, 32, 33) into the c-Jun–silenced MDA-MB-468 cells.
Unexpectedly, mutations at both the Ser63/73 sites (the plasmid
Mut111) and the sites for homodimerization (the plasmid Mut2223) were noted to fail to combat the reversability of exogenous
c-Jun against the c-Jun knockdown-induced decrement in HIF-1a
(Fig. 3C and D). However, mutations at the sites for DNA binding
(the plasmids Mut12 and Mut14) and for heterodimerization (the
plasmid Mut17) caused a dramatic impairment (Fig. 3D). Moreover,
the JNK inhibitor SP600125, which inhibits c-Jun phosphorylation,
was also noted to not cause any change in the levels of the HIF-1a
protein (Fig. 3C). The data collectively indicate that the regions of
c-Jun for DNA binding and heterodimerization, but not those for
phosphorylation or homodimerization, contribute to the protection on HIF-1a, which in turn highlights the nontranscriptional
function of c-Jun.
c-Jun associates with the ODD domain of HIF-1A and blocks
its ubiquitination. HIF-1a protein contains several functional

www.aacrjournals.org

domains, including bHLH, PAS-A, PAS-B, ODD, and TAD (Fig. 4A;
refs. 20, 34). To find out which domain(s) mediates the formation
between c-Jun and HIF-1a, we first used the SPPS program to
analyze the probability of protein interaction based on their
primary sequences (29). The interaction probability of c-Jun with
HIF-1a in either the wild-type or any of the deletion mutations of
bHLH, PAS-A, PAS-B, and TAD was calculated to be >99%. In
contrast, the deletion of the ODD domain dramatically reduced the
interaction probability of c-Jun with HIF-1a to 71% (Fig. 4A),
strongly suggesting the indispensability of the ODD domain for the
formation of c-Jun–HIF-1a complexes.
To validate the role of the ODD domain, the plasmids HA-HIF-1a
(35) and HA-HIF-1a (401D603), which lack the ODD domain (36),
were transfected into both MDA-MB-468 and HeLa cells. Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that c-Jun formed complexes only
with HIF-1a containing the ODD domain (Fig. 4B; Supplementary
Fig. S2). The data substantiate that the ODD domain is responsible
for the interaction of c-Jun with HIF-1a.
Given the ODD domain is well known for HIF-1a ubiquitination
(36, 37), we thus addressed whether this is the case in this setting.

We introduced MG132, a blocker of proteasome-executing HIF-1a
degradation, into our experimental system. The results revealed
that a much greater quantity of HIF-1a was modified with
ubiquitin in the c-Jun–silenced cells than the control MDA-MB468 and HeLa cells (Fig. 4C), indicating that the complexing with
c-Jun blocks HIF-1a ubiquitination and thus any subsequent
degradation.
c-Jun knockdown disrupts HIF-1A–mediated angiogenesisrelated events. VEGF is one of the most important target genes of
HIF-1a. HIF-1a promotes VEGF transcription and angiogenesis
(38, 39). To detect whether c-Jun knockdown impairs HIF-1a
biological function, we first examined the mRNA levels and the
protein secretion of VEGF in the c-Jun–silenced MDA-MB-468 cells.
Silencing c-Jun did not cause any detectable change in either the
mRNA level or the protein secretion of VEGF under normoxic
conditions (Fig. 5A); in contrast, however, there were dramatic
drops in both the mRNA level and protein secretion of VEGF under
hypoxic conditions (Fig. 5A), indicating that a reduction in the
c-Jun level diminishes the transcriptional activity of HIF-1a.
To validate the role of c-Jun and HIF-1a in angiogenesis-related
events, c-Jun and HIF-1a siRNAs were transfected into human
microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Silencing both c-Jun and

HIF-1a (Fig. 5B) reduced the tube formation of HMEC-1 cells when
exposed to both normoxia and hypoxia for 12 hours (Fig. 5B;
Supplementary Fig. S3A). Careful kinetic analyses further revealed
the time dependence. Although both mock and c-Jun siRNAtransfected HMEC-1 cells formed similar numbers of net-like tubes
when exposed to hypoxia for 4 hours, the net-like tubes broke
down much faster in the c-Jun siRNA groups than in the mock
siRNA groups as the exposure time was prolonged (Fig. 5C;
Supplementary Fig. S3B). The expression of HIF-1a (401D603)
partially rescued the degradation of tubes induced by the c-Jun
knockdown (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Fig. S3C), supporting a
functional link between c-Jun and HIF-1a in tube formation.

Discussion
SPPS and coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed c-Jun to be
directly complexed with HIF-1a protein via its ODD domain in
MDA-MB-468 cells. Similar results were replicated in another
human cancer HeLa cell line. Of note, such cooperation between
c-Jun and HIF-1a was further observed to lead to the stabilization
and cellular accumulation of HIF-1a by protecting the HIF-1a
protein from degradation.

hypoxia for 6 h, whereas mutated Mut12,
Mut14, and Mut17 constructs did not.
The experiments above were performed
thrice.

pHA-HIF-1a(401D603), plasmids carrying
mutated HIF-1a (401D603)gene with a
HA-tag. C, immunoprecipitation with
anti–HIF-1a IgG showed that HIF-1a was
modified with ubiquitins in c-Jun–silenced
MDA-MB-468 and HeLa cells exposed to
hypoxia for 6 h. The proteasome inhibitor
MG132 was used to block HIF-1a
degradation. The experiments above
were repeated at least thrice.

c-Jun is a well-established transcription factor known exclusively
for its transcriptional activity (40), owing to its phosphorylation at
Ser63/73 (41). However, in the current study, we show that c-Jun
stabilizes the HIF-1a protein and protects it from ubiquitinationmediated degradation, independent of its well-accepted transcriptional activity. This is substantiated by the fact that neither specific
blockade of the JNK pathway nor mutation of c-Jun at Ser63 and
Ser73 impairs its functional cooperation with HIF-1a. Rather, the
mutations in the regions critical for DNA binding and heterodimerization disrupt the cellular accumulation of HIF-1a. The
contribution of c-Jun to HIF-1a protein stability rather than mRNA
transcription indicates c-Jun functions as a protector, instead of a
transcriptional factor in this case. Given that c-Jun is able to

regulate the stability of another transcriptional factor, it is
necessary to address whether c-Jun–associated partners are also
under such regulation. The expression of neither c-Jun–associated
partners from the AP-1 family, such as c-Fos (42) and JunB (4), nor
non–AP-1 transcription factors, such as SP1 (43) and signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (44), was affected by
c-Jun knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S1B), indicating that the
nontranscriptional function of c-Jun is unique in stabilizing HIF-1a.
The ODD domain is well established as being critical for the
stability of the cellular HIF-1a protein and is controlled by an
oxygen-sensitive prolyl hydroxylase (45). Under normoxic conditions, the prolyl hydroxylase hydroxylates two prolyl residues at
402 and 564 in the ODD domain of HIF-1a. The hydroxylated

HIF-1a then interacts with pVHL and thus enables itself to be
ubiquitinated, which triggers degradation via the proteasome
pathway. In contrast, hypoxia suppresses the enzyme, reduces the
ubiquitination of HIF-1a, and results in the rapid accumulation of
the latter in cells (46). In our study, we showed that the ODD
domain mediates the association of c-Jun with HIF-1a under
hypoxia, as evidenced by both SPPS analysis and coimmunoprecipitation assay. The details for the precise mechanism of this novel
regulatory process remain open to further investigation. Nevertheless, these results establish an indispensable link and highlight the
contribution of the ODD domain to the stabilization of HIF-1a by

c-Jun. In parallel, the ODD domain is reported to be necessary for
an oxygen-independent degradation pathway (47) besides its known
oxygen-dependent event. This account fits in principle with our
results and supports the outcome that the ODD domain is essential
for this novel regulatory mode of HIF-1a. Together with the data
presented here, a model is proposed (Fig. 6). c-Jun, under hypoxia,
first complexes with and then masks the ODD domain of HIF-1a.
c-Jun in the complexes in turn acts as a molecular barrier to prevent
HIF-1a from being attacked by ubiquitin E3 ligase complexes.
The effect of c-Jun on the stability of HIF-1a was further related
to VEGF expression and endothelial tube formation. Silencing c-Jun

A, RT-PCR and ELISA assays showed that c-Jun
siRNA-2 led to a decrease in VEGF mRNA and in
the secretion of VEGF in MDA-MB-468 cells
exposed to hypoxia for 12 h. B, c-Jun or HIF-1a
silencing led to reduced tube formation more clearly
under hypoxia than normoxia for 12 h. C, c-Jun
silencing caused a more prominently decreased
HMEC-1 tube formation of HMEC-1 cells as hypoxia
was prolonged over a period of 12 h. D, the
expression of HIF-1a (401D603) partially rescued
the degradation of the tubes induced by c-Jun
knockdown under hypoxia for 12 h. The experiments
above were repeated thrice. Columns, mean; bars,

c-Jun Stabilizes HIF-1a

Figure 6. A schematic presentation of
the functions of c-Jun and of the regulation
of HIF-1astability. The classic function of
c-Jun is to regulate the transcription of
target genes in the form of homodimers or
heterodimers (AP-1) following its own
phosphorylation. HIF-1a is ubiquitinated
within its ODD domain followed by
destruction via the proteasome. Our
present study proposes a novel regulatory
mode of HIF-1a such that c-Jun binds to
the ODD domain of HIF-1a, functions as a
molecular barrier that prevents HIF-1a
from ubiquitination, and thus stabilizes
cellular HIF-1a. In this case, c-Jun does not
function as a transcription factor, and its
Ser63/73 phosphorylation is not required.

led not only to a decrease in VEGF gene transcription and the
secretion of VEGF protein but also to an accelerated degradation of
the endothelial tube–like network. As previously reported (48), we
further confirm the contribution of HIF-1a to tube formation by
the silencing of HIF-1a. In particular, the ectopic expression of the
ODD domain–lacking HIF-1a partially rescues the degradation of
tube formation in c-Jun–deficient HMEC-1 cells. Although c-Jun
has been shown to induce VEGF expression in a HIF-1–
independent manner (49, 50), our data indeed provide strong
support that c-Jun is mediated by HIF-1a to regulate VEGF and
tube formation, thus establishing the functional significance of the
stabilization of HIF-1a by c-Jun, at least in this experimental
setting.
Thus, far it has been shown that both HIF-1a and c-Jun are
concurrently engaged in multiple malignant behaviors and have a
functional cooperation in transcription activation (23–25). Moreover, the activation of c-Jun by HIF-1 under hypoxia has also been
reported (26, 27). This study offers a novel mechanistic insight into
their distinct contributions to tumor progression: a novel
regulatory mode of HIF-1a activity and a nontranscriptional

modulates HIF-1a, and this will advance the understanding of the
previous HIF-1a stabilization program under hypoxia. In turn, this
will allow a probing of the complicated pathophysiologic events in
tumor progression as well as new therapeutic approaches.
