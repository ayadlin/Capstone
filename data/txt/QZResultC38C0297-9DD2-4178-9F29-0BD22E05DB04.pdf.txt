BACKGROUND: In what to the authors’ knowledge is the first such study for a pediatric cancer, a large database was
retrospectively analyzed to assess statistically the likelihood of response to a given salvage therapy in different clinical subsets of patients. METHODS: Treatment was comprised of high-dose cyclophosphamide (at a dose of 140 mg/
kg), topotecan (at a dose of 8 mg/m2), and vincristine (at a dose of 0.067 mg/kg or 2 mg/m2, whichever was lower;
maximum dose, 2 mg) (HD-CTV). The Fisher exact test was used for comparisons of response rates among standard
subsets of patients (n ¼ 126) with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma (NB). RESULTS: Among children, major (ie,
complete/partial) responses occurred in 11 of 58 (19%) with primary refractory NB, 4 of 14 (29%) with secondary refractory NB, 13 of 25 (52%) with a new (first) disease recurrence, and none of 13 patients with progressive disease
(PD) while receiving therapy. Other children had mixed responses (MRs); when combining major responses and MRs,
anti-NB activity was noted in 26 of 58 (45%) children with primary refractory NB, 10 of 14 (71%) children with secondary refractory NB, 20 of 25 (80%) children with a new (first) disease recurrence, and 1 of 13 (8%) children with PD
while receiving therapy. The response rate was significantly different across the 4 groups of children for both major
responses (P ¼.003) and combined responses (P ¼.001). All 10 adolescents/adults treated for primary refractory NB
had no response, which was a significantly inferior result compared with the response rate of 45% noted in children
with primary refractory NB (P ¼.008). CONCLUSIONS: Response to HD-CTV as salvage therapy is significantly less
likely in adolescents/adults and in children with NB that is persistent or progressing on treatment rather than newly
recurrent off treatment. These findings are broadly applicable and should be considered when designing, and interC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Standard treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) includes dose-dense or dose-intensive induction as well as
myeloablative therapy, plus complex surgery and radiotherapy. This aggressive multimodality treatment can leave patients
with tenuous renal function, susceptibility to cardiac failure, and hearing deficits, which are especially grievous sequelae in
young children. Nevertheless, persistence or recurrence of NB occurs in >50% of patients.1,2 The topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan has demonstrated anti-NB activity and modest hematologic or extramedullary toxicity, hence its frequent
inclusion in salvage regimens.3-7 Topotecan is also now part of induction regimens for newly diagnosed NB in the Children’s Oncology Group (COG)8 and in a German national study.7
We previously described a combination of high-dose cyclophosphamide (140 mg/kg) and topotecan (6 mg/m2) for
patients with resistant pediatric neoplasms, including NB.9 That regimen was used against NB as induction therapy in an
Italian study, with encouraging results.10 Our favorable experience with regard to anti-NB activity and toxicity led us to
increase the dosage of topotecan from 6 to 8 mg/m2 and add vincristine, which can synergize with topotecan.11 This

regimen of high-dose cyclophosphamide, topotecan, and
vincristine (HD-CTV) proved attractive for use in a wide
range of patients with NB.
A report highlighting the immunomodulatory
effects of HD-CTV included preliminary data regarding
anti-NB activity (26 patients assessable for response).12 In
the current study, we present a greatly expanded experience, focusing on anti-NB activity in an additional 100
patients (for a total of 126 patients). The large cohort
allowed for statistical analyses of the comparative efficacy
of a given salvage treatment in different clinical subsets of
patients with refractory or recurrent NB, making it to our
knowledge the first such study for any pediatric cancer.
The results of this retrospective study underscore the importance of defining the clinical status of patients when
assessing anti-NB activity in previously treated patients.
In particular, NB is more chemoresistant when it is persistent or progressing on therapy rather than newly recurrent
off therapy. Our experience also reinforces prior evidence
that NB is more chemoresistant, for unknown reasons, in
adolescents/adults compared with children.13,14 Assessing
anti-NB activity in an unfavorable setting might therefore
lead to a misleading underestimation of a treatment’s
potential benefit. The findings are broadly applicable and
should be taken into account when designing, and interpreting the results of, phase 2 studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The use of HD-CTV was based on a pilot study.9 The
subjects of this retrospective analysis were the first 126
consecutive and unselected patients at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) treated since 2000
with HD-CTV for chemoresistant NB who were assessable for response. Patients diagnosed at age >10 years
were classified as adolescents. The patients were grouped
by the 4 standard clinical subsets of chemoresistant disease
(Table 1). Thus, the patients received HD-CTV 1) as
treatment for primary refractory disease (ie, NB responding incompletely to induction [first-line] therapy, but no
history of disease recurrence or progressive disease [PD]);
2) as treatment for secondary refractory disease (ie, recurrent NB responding incompletely to salvage therapy); 3)
as the initial treatment for a new disease recurrence that
occurred while the patient was in remission and not
receiving chemotherapy; or 4) as treatment for PD that
developed while the patient was receiving chemotherapy.
HD-CTV was comprised of cyclophosphamide at a
dose of 70 mg/kg administered on Days 1 and 2 (140 mg/
kg [approximately 4200 mg/m2] /course), topotecan at a
dose of 2 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 4 (8 mg/m2/course), and
vincristine at a dose of 0.067 mg/kg or 2 mg/m2 (whichever was lower; maximum dose, 2 mg) on Day 1.12 Pretreatment requirements included a platelet count

>75,000/lL and grade <2 cardiac (including echocardiographic findings), hepatic, and renal toxicity as determined using the National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). HD-CTV was administered on an outpatient basis and granulocyte–colonystimulating factor was used while the absolute neutrophil
count was <1000/lL. Patients received a second course of
treatment if the first demonstrated anti-NB activity but
assessable disease remained and if nonhematologic toxicity was grade <2.
In accordance with hospital rules, informed written
consent for treatment was obtained from guardians or
adult patients after they understood the side effects of
each agent, the toxicities encountered in the pilot study
that used the same high dose of cyclophosphamide combined with a lower dosage of topotecan,9 and the possibility of unforeseen toxicities. For this retrospective study, an
Institutional Review Board waiver was obtained for the
examination and analysis of patient records (26 patients
were in a previous report12 focusing on the immunomodulatory effects of HD-CTV; 3 other patients in that
report were either treated while in complete disease remission or were not assessable for response and therefore were
not included in the current study of this regimen’s antiNB activity).
HD-CTV was used with the objective of reducing
tumor burden before enrolling patients on formal protocols; hence, HD-CTV was preceded and followed by a
complete restaging, as well as evaluations of major organs,
including the heart (by echocardiography), kidneys, and
liver. Disease status and toxicities were reviewed on a
patient-by-patient basis and incorporated into a database.
Disease status was assessed by computed tomography or
magnetic resonance imaging, 123iodine-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) scan, urine catecholamine levels,
and bone marrow histology (aspirates and biopsies from
bilateral posterior iliac crests, and aspirates with or without biopsies from bilateral anterior iliac crests). Bone marrow histology and radiologic studies were read by
MSKCC specialists outside the Department of Pediatrics
who were unaware of the treatment or patient status.
The International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria
(INRC)15 were used as modified in the COG ANBL0532
protocol (available at: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00567567)
to incorporate 123I-MIBG findings. A complete response
(CR) indicated no evidence of NB in soft tissue, bones, or
bone marrow, and catecholamines were normal. Very
good partial response (VGPR) indicated the primary mass
was reduced by 90%; there was no evidence of distant

3056

disease in soft tissue, bones, or bone marrow, including a
negative 123I-MIBG scan; and catecholamines were normal. A partial response (PR) indicated a >50% decrease
in measurable disease, 123I-MIBG scan improved in all
lesions, and 1 positive bone marrow site. A mixed
response (MR) indicated a >50% decrease in any lesion
with a <50% decrease in any other, and the 123I-MIBG
scan improved in some but not all sites. No response
(NR) indicated a <50% decrease but a <25% increase in
any existing lesion. PD indicated a new lesion or a >25%
increase in an existing lesion.
The Fisher exact test was used for comparisons of
response rates among the 4 clinical patient subsets of chemoresistant NB. Because there were only 5 patients who
were treated for a new second or greater disease recurrence
(Table 2), they were not included in the statistical
calculations.

RESULTS
Patient Population
The 126 patients all had high-risk disease and received 1
(n ¼ 69 patients) or 2 (n ¼ 57 patients) courses of HDCTV for primary refractory NB, secondary refractory
NB, a new recurrence of disease, or PD that occurred
while receiving therapy (Table 1). Prior treatments
included high-dose cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and
vincristine (HD-Cy/Dox/V) on MSKCC and COG protocols (A3973, ANBL02P1, and ANBL0532)16,17 in 113
patients (90%), stem cell transplantation in 39 patients
(31%), topotecan in 32 patients (25%), and irinotecan in
19 patients (15%).
Comparisons of Response Rates
As shown in Table 2, HD-CTV achieved major responses
(CR/VGPR þ PR) in 11 of 58 children with primary refractory NB (19%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI],
10-31%), 4 of 14 children with secondary refractory NB
(29%; 95% CI, 8-58%), 13 of 25 children with a new
(first) disease recurrence (52%; 95% CI, 31-73%), and 0
of 13 children with PD while receiving standard therapy
(0%; 95% CI, 0-25%). The difference in the rate of major
responses was statistically significant (P ¼ .003).
Other patients achieved MR. Combining major
responses and MRs, anti-NB activity was noted in 26 of 58
children with primary refractory NB (45%; 95% CI, 3360%), 10 of 14 children with secondary refractory NB
(71%; 95% CI, 42-92%), 20 of 25 children with a new
(first) disease recurrence (80%; 95% CI, 61-95%), and 1 of

Details of Responses
There were 29 major responses (CR/VGPR þ PR) (Table
2), including 11 in patients with MYCN-amplified NB.
The 15 CR/VGPRs were all reported in children; the sites
of NB were the bone marrow alone (n ¼ 9), osteomedullary
MIBG uptake alone (n ¼ 2), soft tissue alone (n ¼ 1), and
osteomedullary MIBG uptake plus bone marrow (n ¼ 2) or
soft tissue (n ¼ 1). Thirteen of the 14 PRs occurred in children; the sites of NB were soft tissue alone (n ¼ 5) or plus
bone marrow (n ¼ 1), osteomedullary MIBG uptake alone
(n ¼ 2) or plus bone marrow (n ¼ 3), a mandibular mass
(n ¼ 1), and bone marrow alone (n ¼ 1). One PR occurred
in an adult who was treated for a new (second) disease recurrence involving the bone marrow and soft tissue.

in other sites (n ¼ 13), improved MIBG scan (n ¼ 8),

tissue disease (n ¼ 2), and less than a PR of soft tissue disease (n ¼ 2).
At the time of last follow-up, 21 patients were longterm event-free survivors (ie, >2 years after CTV); all
received other therapy, which varied depending on
response and protocol availability. Overall, event-free survivors include 28 patients in the primary refractory NB
subset, at 0.5 to 8.7 years (median, 2.9 years) after HDCTV; 2 patients in the secondary refractory NB subset
with short follow-up (0.5 years and 1.9 years, respectively,
after HD-CTV); and 8 patients in the new disease recurrence subset, at 0.5 to 4.6 years (median, 1.5 years) after
HD-CTV. In the PD subset, 11 of 13 patients died of disease within 11 months of treatment with HD-CTV.

Toxicity
Myelosuppression was grade 4 but did not preclude the
collection of hematopoietic stem cells from the peripheral
blood. Thus, 11 of 11 patients had collections after 1
(n ¼ 8) or 2 (n ¼ 3) courses of HD-CTV, with yields of
2.2 to 137 million CD34-positive cells/kg (median, 9.2
cells/kg) over 1 to 4 days. Blood-borne infections were
documented in 28 (15%) of 183 courses. Rare side effects
included grade 2 or 3 mucositis in 4 patients, grade 3
typhlitis in 3 patients, grade 3 or 4 hepatotoxicity in 2
patients, grade 3 hemorrhagic cystitis in 1 patient, and
grade 2 vincristine-related pain in 2 patients. Cardiac and
renal function remained intact. There were no known secondary malignancies.

DISCUSSION
This report covers a multiagent regimen derived from a
prior pilot study9 and used against chemoresistant NB in
126 patients, which is a large cohort for this poor-prognosis solid tumor. The extensive experience resulted from
our use of HD-CTV in a variety of difficult clinical situations among the many NB patients referred to our service
for salvage therapy. The regimen’s anti-NB activity and
modest nonhematologic toxicity were appealing for inclusion in treatment plans developed for patients already
exposed to cardiotoxic and nephrotoxic therapy. We used
this unique database to statistically assess the likelihood of
response to a given salvage therapy in different clinical
subsets of patients with chemoresistant NB.
Clinical factors and age were found to be significantly
correlated with the likelihood of achieving disease regression.
Thus, major responses (CR/VGPR þ PR) were significantly
more common (52%) in children with a new (first) disease
recurrence compared with children with primary refractory
NB (19%), secondary refractory NB (29%), or PD that
occurred during induction therapy (0%) (P ¼ .003). HDCTV was also found to be significantly less active against primary refractory NB in adolescents/adults compared with
children (P ¼ .008). The latter finding is consistent with the
excessive chemoresistance that is characteristic of NB diagnosed in older patients, a phenomenon that is likely multifactorial in etiology.13,14
The data document: 1) the importance of characterizing clinical subsets of chemoresistant NB when designing a study to investigate the antitumor activity of a novel
treatment, and 2) the need for details regarding the different clinical subsets of chemoresistant NB in reports documenting the results of salvage regimens.
Concern that phase 1 or 2 studies in previously treated
patients might underestimate a treatment’s antitumor activity led to upfront phase 2 investigational window studies.
The strategy of using unproven treatments in patients with
newly diagnosed high-risk NB has yielded data regarding the
potential clinical utility of novel therapies.18,19 The view that
this strategy, which entails deferring standard therapy for up
to 2 months, does not compromise outcome may no longer
be valid. In what to our knowledge is the largest upfront window NB study reported to date (performed between 1994
and 1995), the subsequent disease-free survival rate was
<20% at 6 years.18 Far better results appear likely with current programs. For example, 1 group reported a progressionfree survival rate of 47% at 5 years.20 That expectation
undermines the justification for delaying optimal therapy.
One consequence is that the identification of active anti-NB

3058

treatments might again become largely dependent on classic
phase 2 studies in previously treated patients. The current
study provides statistically significant data supporting the
imperative of carefully defining the patient subsets in phase 2
trials to obtain the most reliable efficacy data.
The considerable anti-NB activity of HD-CTV
(Table 2) is noteworthy given that 1) the extensive prior
therapy included HD-Cy/Dox/V in 90% of patients and
topotecan in 25% of patients; 2) the evaluation of
response featured studies of bone marrow specimens
obtained from 4 sites rather than the 2 sites mandated by
the INRC15 plus 123I-MIBG scanning, which to the best
of our knowledge is the most sensitive radiologic means
for detecting refractory21 or newly recurrent NB22; and 3)
the responses occurred with only 1 or 2 courses of HDCTV. In contrast, the few other reports3,4,6,7 with data
available regarding topotecan-containing multiagent regimens used against recurrent or refractory NB only
included patients who were not previously treated with
topotecan, and many of the maximal responses were
reached after multiple courses (as many as 77 or 86
courses) were administered.
The relatively low-dose regimens using topotecan
(3.75-7.5 mg/m2) plus either cyclophosphamide (1250
mg/m2)3 or the topoisomerase II inhibitors doxorubicin
(45 mg/m2) or etoposide (300 mg/m2)4,6 have been welcome additions to the therapeutic options for patients
with resistant NB in large part because they entail modest
toxicity. With a strongly myelosuppressive regimen comprised of topotecan (1 mg/m2/day on Days 1-7), cyclophosphamide (100 mg/m2/day on Days 1-7), and
etoposide (100 mg/m2/day on Days 8-10), toxicity was
deemed acceptable, given the anti-NB activity; therefore,
the regimen became part of a randomized multicenter
window trial.7 Another strongly myelosuppressive regimen, comprised of the combination of topotecan (6 mg/
m2) and cyclophosphamide (2000 mg/m2), had expected
and reversible toxicities in a pilot study (responses were
not reported),8 and was incorporated into the current
COG ANBL0532 phase 3 trial.
With HD-CTV, myelosuppression is the predominant toxicity and is comparable in severity and duration
to that noted with the MSKCC HD-Cy/Dox/V regimen
(also used in the COG A3973, ANBL02P1, and
ANBL0532 protocols),16,17 but mucositis is much less
common. The absence of toxicity to major organs (eg, the
heart, kidneys, and liver) supports the use of HD-CTV in
heavily pretreated patients. Unlike other classes of antiNB chemotherapeutic agents, including alkylators and

topoisomerase II inhibitors (eg, etoposide and doxorubicin), to our knowledge topoisomerase I inhibitors such as
topotecan have not to date been associated with secondary
leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.
We began exploring the use of topotecan in
1998.9,12,23-25 Our interest derived from preclinical and
clinical data that indicated that this agent 1) might be less
affected by P-glycoprotein multidrug resistance compared
with topoisomerase II inhibitors such as doxorubicin and
etoposide26; 2) had modest hematologic and extramedullary toxicity27-29; 3) efficiently crossed the blood-brain
barrier30; and 4) could potentiate the antitumor activity
of alkylators.31 We combined it with high-dose cyclophosphamide to exploit the dose-response relation
between NB and alkylating agents,32 while taking advantage of cyclophosphamide’s bone marrow stem cell-sparing
feature,33 its limited extramedullary toxicity, and its
immunomodulatory activity.34 The lack of pharmacologic interaction between topotecan and cyclophosphamide was reassuring.35 In a pilot study,9 toxicity proved
tolerable and antitumor activity was encouraging; therefore, we increased the topotecan dosage from 6 to 8 mg/
m2 per course, added vincristine based on preclinical data
demonstrating synergistic cytotoxicity when combined
with topotecan,11 and began using HD-CTV in selected
clinical settings.12,36
In comparison with the other topotecan-containing
multiagent regimens,3-10 the results of the current study
demonstrate that, combined with vincristine (which may
synergize with topotecan11), even higher dosages of cyclophosphamide (4200 mg/m2) and topotecan (8 mg/m2)
are tolerable, feasible, and compatible with the successful
collection of peripheral blood stem cells. The success of
high-dose cyclophosphamide, as in HD-CTV, in preventing early sensitization to a murine monoclonal antibody
has been well established12,34; a similar efficacy would be
expected with other xenogenic immunotherapeutic agents
and with chimeric antibodies. The overall experience
demonstrates the wide potential applicability of HDCTV. Furthermore, the statistical analyses in the current
study provide objective confirmation of the risk that antiNB activity (as in a phase 2 trial) might be erroneously
overlooked if a novel treatment is assessed in clinical subsets of patients unlikely to respond to any therapy.
