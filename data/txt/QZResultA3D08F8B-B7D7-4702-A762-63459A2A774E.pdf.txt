Abstract
Using biopsy specimens from patients with B-cell nonHodgkin’s lymphoma, we observed a significantly low frequency of TH17 cells, including several samples with no
detectable amount of interleukin (IL)-17–producing cells
present in the tumor microenvironment. We found that, in
the absence of lymphoma B cells, treatment with IL-1B/IL-6 or
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhanced IL-17 expression in CD4+ T
cells and this enhancement was attenuated when CD4+ T cells
were cocultured with lymphoma B cells. Blockade of CD27CD70 or CD28-CD80/86 interactions by anti-CD70 or antiCD80/86 antibodies restored LPS-mediated induction of IL-17
expression in CD4+ T cells cocultured with lymphoma B cells.
Because a subset of lymphoma B cells express IL-2 and given
that IL-2 signaling is critically important in the development
of regulatory T (Treg) cells, we tested the role of IL-2 signaling
in TH17 cell development. We found that treatment with antiIL-2 antibody to interrupt IL-2 signaling significantly inhibited
Foxp3 expression in CD4+ T cells. In contrast, interruption of
IL-2 signaling up-regulated IL-17 expression in CD4+ T cells
and restored lymphoma-mediated down-regulation of IL-17–
producing cells. Furthermore, the reversal of Treg cell activity
by LPS or CpG-A resulted in an enhancement of IL-17–
producing cells. Taken together, our study indicated that
lymphoma B cells play an important role in skewing the
balance between Treg and TH 17 cells resulting in the
establishment of a profoundly inhibitory tumor microenvironment. [Cancer Res 2009;69(13):5522–30]

Introduction
Newly identified interleukin (IL)-17–secreting CD4+ helper T cells
expand the family of TH cells into three major lineages, TH1, TH2,
and TH17 cells (1–3). CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells form
another major lineage of CD4+ T cells (4). TH17 and Treg cells
constitute two opposing immune responses that are critically
involved in the modulation of inflammation induced by either
autoimmunity or bacterial infection. TH17 and Treg cells develop
from precursor naive CD4+ T cells and the mechanisms leading to
differentiation of TH17 cells have been predominantly described in
mice. The data thus far suggest that the presence of transforming
growth factor-h (TGF-h) and IL-6 during activation of precursor
CD4+ T cells drives differentiation into TH17 cells (1–3), whereas
the presence of TGF-h alone promotes differentiation of Treg cells

(5, 6). The differentiation of precursor CD4+ T cells into Treg or
TH17 cells is thought to be mutually exclusive. Compared with the
murine system, less is known about human TH17 cell differentiation. However, studies suggest that induction of human TH17
cells is unique in that IL-6 and IL-1h, not TGF-h, drive their
differentiation (7–9).
In previous work, we have found that the antitumor response in
B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is profoundly suppressed by the
presence of large numbers of intratumoral Treg cells (10, 11). We
have established that non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma B cells induce
Foxp3 expression in CD4+CD25- T cells and contribute to the
development of Treg cells in the malignant lymph nodes (12). Given
that the generation of effector TH17 and inhibitory Treg cells from
naive CD4+ precursors employs reciprocal developmental pathways
and that Treg cells are present in substantial numbers in the tumor
microenvironment, we explored whether the development of Treg
cells induced by tumor cells resulted in inhibition of the
differentiation of TH17 cells. We also explored the mechanisms
involved in potential tumor cell-mediated suppression of TH17 cell
differentiation. In the present study, we observed that a low
number of TH17 cells are present in the tumor microenvironment
of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and that an imbalance exists between
intratumoral Treg and TH17 cells. Furthermore, we found that nonHodgkin’s lymphoma B cells play an important role in establishing
the imbalance between Treg and TH17 cells by up-regulating Treg
cells and inhibiting TH17 cells.

Patients, Materials, and Methods
Patient samples. Patients providing written informed consent were
eligible for this study if they had a tissue biopsy that on pathologic review
showed B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and adequate tissue to perform the
experiments. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors,
normal lymph nodes, and normal tonsils were used as controls. The use of
human tissue samples for this study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the Mayo Clinic/Mayo Foundation.
Cell isolation and purification. Fresh tumor biopsy specimens from
patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, normal lymph nodes, and
normal tonsil tissues were gently minced over a wire-mesh screen to obtain
a cell suspension. The cell suspension or peripheral blood from healthy
donors was centrifuged over Ficoll-Hypaque at 500  g for 15 min to isolate
mononuclear cells. CD4+ T cells and CD19+ B cells were isolated using
positive selection with CD4 and CD19 microbeads. CD4+CD45RA+ and
CD4+CD45RO+ T-cell subsets were purified by using a CD4+CD45RA+ naive
T-cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). CD4+CCR6+ T cells were isolated by
CD4- selection and the resulting CD4+ T cells were incubated with biotinconjugated CCR6 antibody followed by incubation with streptavidinconjugated microbeads. Dendritic cells were isolated using a monocyte
adherence technique described previously (12).
Intracellular staining and flow cytometry. Intracellular IL-17 staining
was done following the manufacturer’s instructions and cells were analyzed
on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. CD4+ T cells were cultured in anti-CD3coated plates (BD Biosciences) with anti-CD28 (BD Biosciences) for 3 days
and then stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin in

the presence of protein transport inhibitor brefeldin A for 5 h. Cells were
stained with anti-IL-17-PE and anti-IFN-g-APC to detect the frequency of
TH17 cells in each specimen. The same specimens were then used in the
subsequent experiments. To ensure that the results were valid for all
lymphoma subtypes, each experiment included lymphoma cells from
various histologic types.
Where indicated, cultures were supplemented with the following reagents
alone or combination: anti-human IFN-g (2 Ag/mL), IL-6 (10 ng/mL), TGF-h
(10 ng/mL), IL-1h (10 ng/mL), IL-23 (10 ng/mL), lipopolysaccharide (LPS;
100 ng/mL), or CpG-A/scrambled CpG-A (3 Ag/mL). CpG-A (G*GGGGACGATCGTCG*G*G*G*G*G) and scrambled CpG-A (G*GGGGAGCATGCTGC*G*G*G*G*G) were synthesized by the DNA Sequencing and
Synthesis Core Facility at Mayo Clinic as described previously (13).
Foxp3 expression was determined using flow-based intracellular staining
following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then stained with
Alexa 488-conjugated anti-Foxp3 antibody for 30 min and analyzed by flow
cytometry.
ELISA. The IL-17 concentration in culture supernatants was measured
by ELISA (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, supernatants were collected from the culture of CD4+ T cells. Assay
Diluent RD1-36 (100 AL) was dispensed into each well in the IL-17
microplate and 100 AL standard or sample was added to the wells. After
washing, 200 AL anti-IL-17 conjugate was dispensed into each well. After
stopping the reaction, the absorbance of each well was determined using a
SpectraMax190 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) set to 450 nm and
analyzed using SoftMax Pro 5 software.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was done using Student’s
t test. Significance was determined at P < 0.05.

Frequency of TH17 cells in biopsy specimens of B-cell nonHodgkin’s lymphoma. The percentage of TH17 cells in B-cell nonHodgkin’s lymphoma biopsy specimens was determined. Benign
biopsy specimens of patients with hyperplasia (benign lymph
node), peripheral blood, and tonsils of healthy individuals were
used as controls. The frequency of CD4+ IL-17–producing T cells
was significantly lower in biopsy specimens from non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (median, 0.44% of the total CD4+ T cells; range, 0.025.67%; n = 43 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma samples) compared with
those from patients with hyperplasia (median, 1.65%; range, 0.5110%; n = 16 benign lymph nodes; P = 0.009) or peripheral blood
(median, 1.25%; range, 0.45-18.1%; n = 17 healthy individuals; P =
0.015) and tonsil (median, 5.3%; range, 2.2-11%; n = 6; P = 0.003)
from healthy individuals (Fig. 1A).
Interestingly, we noted three different patterns of IL-17
expression in CD4+ T cells (Fig. 1B). In some specimens, such as
that shown as NHL1, we were not able to detect IL-17 expression in
CD4+ T cells (referred to as undetectable). However, IFN-g
expression could be detected in CD4+ T cells, suggesting that a
lack of IL-17 production in CD4+ T cells from these particular
samples was not due to unresponsiveness to activation. In contrast
to NHL1, CD4+ T cells from both NHL2 and NHL3 were able to
produce IL-17 and IFN-g. In NHL2, we found a second pattern in
which IL-17 expression appeared to be independent of IFN-g
expression. In NHL3, unlike NHL2, we found that a subset of CD4+
IL-17–producing T cells also expresses IFN-g.
In addition to a low frequency of CD4+ IL-17–producing
T cells, we also observed that the number of specimens with
an undetectable amount of IL-17–producing cells was higher
in patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma compared with that in
normal lymph nodes, tonsil, and peripheral blood. As shown in
Fig. 1C, of the 43 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma specimens, 15 (23%)

were identified as undetectable for IL-17 expression. In contrast, we
saw that, of the 16 normal lymph node specimens, only 1 (5.9%)
had undetectable IL-17 expression. Furthermore, we were able to
detect CD4+ IL-17–producing cells in all of the specimens from
normal peripheral blood and tonsils.
We found that there was variability in the frequency of IL-17–
producing cells among specimens from different histologic types of
lymphoma. Although most lymphoma specimens had low numbers
of IL-17–producing cells, it appeared that highest frequency of
IL-17–producing cells were seen in specimens from patients with
small lymphocytic lymphoma (n = 7). Mantle cell lymphoma (n = 7)
and lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (n = 2)
contained a considerable number of IL-17–producing cells.
In contrast, samples from follicular (n = 11), diffuse large B-cell
(n = 3), and marginal zone (n = 9) lymphomas exhibited a very low
frequency of IL-17–producing cells (Fig. 1D).
To determine the overall relevance of TH17 cells in nonHodgkin’s lymphoma, we looked for an association between the
number of intratumoral TH17 cells and clinical parameters
particularly the risk of progression or overall survival. Although
the effect of intratumoral TH17 cells on progression and survival
could not be directly assessed in this study, due to small numbers
of patients and short follow-up, the number of TH17 cells did
correlate with the international prognostic factor index (P = 0.014;
ref. 14) and the absolute lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood
(P = 0.039; ref. 15), both of which have been shown to be prognostic
factors in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
Phenotypic characterization of TH17 cells in non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma. As shown in Fig. 2A, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were
able to express IL-17, which is consistent with the results found in
various types of cancers in mice (16). CD19+ B cells or other cell
types, including macrophages and dendritic cells, did not express
IL-17 (Fig. 2A, right ). Because the frequency of CD8 +
T cells in lymphoma specimens is low (17), it is likely that TH17
cells are the primary source of IL-17 production in the tumor
microenvironment. We next wanted to determine if naive or
memory CD4+ T cells produced IL-17 (Fig. 2B). We found that
CD4+CD45RO+ memory T cells expressed more IL-17 than
CD4+CD45RA+ naive T cells as detected by both intracellular
staining (1.7% versus 0.3% respectively; n = 12 non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma samples; P = 0.001) and ELISA (125 versus 12 pg/mL;
n = 6 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma samples; P = 0.01). This is in
keeping with the observation that IL-17–producing cells are
memory T cells (18, 19).
Recent studies have shown that the vast majority of IL-17–
producing cells are CD4+CCR6+ T cells (8, 9, 20). To determine if
this holds true in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma specimens, we
enriched for CD4+CCR6+ T cells and measured IL-17 expression
by both intracellular staining and ELISA (Fig. 2C). We found that
CD4+CCR6+ T cells produced higher levels of IL-17 than CD4+CCR6T cells measured by both intracellular staining and ELISA.
Cytokine regulation of TH17 cell generation in nonHodgkin’s lymphoma. To determine whether CD4+ T cells from
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma specimens could respond to cytokines
permissive for the generation of TH17 cells, we measured IL-17
expression in CD4+ T cells treated with a panel of cytokines known
to influence TH17 generation. As shown in Fig. 3A, we observed that
IL-1h or IL-6 alone or in combination increased the number of
CD4+ IL-17–producing cells. We found that treatment with TGF-h
alone was not sufficient to induce IL-17 expression and, in most
cases, slightly inhibited the expression of IL-17 in CD4+ T cells (data

not shown). We then measured the number of IL-17–producing
cells and the level of IL-17 concentration in CD4+ T cells treated
without or with IL-1h plus IL-6 in multiple samples (n = 10 nonHodgkin’s lymphoma samples) and confirmed that IL-1h/IL-6
promoted IL-17 production as determined by both intracellular
staining and ELISA (Fig. 3B).
To exclude the possibility that low numbers of TH17 cells are due
to low levels of IL-1h, IL-2, or IL-6, we measured the concentration
of IL-1h, IL-2, and IL-6 in serum of patients with follicular
lymphoma as well as normal controls. We found that IL-1h levels in
the serum from patients with follicular lymphoma (median, 0.047
ng/mL; range, undetectable to 0.52 ng/mL; n = 32) were similar to
that of normal controls (median, 0.061 ng/mL; range, undetectable
to 1.37 ng/mL; n = 49; P = 0.72). The IL-6 concentration was in fact
higher in serum from patients with follicular lymphoma (median,
17.5 ng/mL; range, undetectable to 80 ng/mL; n = 32) than in
normal controls (median, 6.94 ng/mL; range, undetectable to 120
ng/mL; n = 49; P = 0.043). IL-2 levels were similar in patients
(median, 0.012 ng/mL; range, undetectable to 0.18 ng/mL; n = 32)
and controls (median, 0.026 ng/mL; range, undetectable to
0.28 ng/mL; n = 24; P = 0.29). These results suggested that the
low number of TH17 cells is not due to decreased levels of IL-1h
and IL-6 in patients.
As shown in Fig. 3C, we observed that treatment with IL-1h/
IL-6 not only increased the numbers of CD4+ IL-17–producing
cells but also induced IL-17 expression in IFN-g-producing cells.
Interestingly, treatment with TGF-h decreased IFN-g expression
in CD4+ IL-17–producing T cells induced by IL-1h/IL-6.
It appeared that TGF-h completely blocked the expression of
IFN-g in IL-17–producing cells induced by IL-1h/IL-6 and

Regulation of Tumor TH17 Cells

‘‘purified’’ IL-17–producing cells into a TH17 subset similar to
that originally described in mice.
Due to the dual expression of IL-17 and IFN-g in some cells, we
next determined if altering IFN-g expression had an effect on the
development of TH17 cells (Fig. 3D). Similar to TGF-h, anti-IFN-g
antibody treatment cleared the population of IL-17+IFN-g+ T cells
but further enhanced the up-regulation of IL-17+IFN-g- T cells. This
suggested that the generation of TH17 cells can be affected by the
development of TH1 cells, consistent with the concept that the
development of TH cell subsets is mutually and exclusively
regulated.
Effect of malignant B cells on the generation of TH17 cells. It
is unknown whether lymphoma cells play a role in the generation
of TH17 cells. We therefore first used a CD19 depletion approach to
determine the effect of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cells on TH17 cell
generation. We found that, in the presence of lymphoma cells,
IL-1h/IL-6-mediated TH17 cell generation was inhibited (<0.6% of
total CD4+ T cells; n = 6 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma samples). In
contrast, depletion of lymphoma cells resulted in the enhancement
of IL-17–producing T cells by IL-1h/IL-6 (4.5% of total CD4+ T cells;

n = 8 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma samples; Fig. 4A). These results
suggested that lymphoma B cells suppress TH17 cell generation.
We also employed a coculture system in which CD4+ T cells
isolated from tumor biopsy specimens were cultured with or
without CD19+ lymphoma cells (IL-1h and IL-6 were used as before
and LPS was used as an additional positive control). As shown in
Fig. 4B, in the absence of stimulation, there was no significant
difference in the number of IL-17–producing cells between CD4+ T
cells cocultured with or without lymphoma cells (2.3% versus 2.7%).
As expected, treatment of T cells with IL-1h/IL-6 enhanced the
number of IL-17–producing cells from 2.7% to 7.5%. However, in
the presence of lymphoma cells, IL-1h/IL-6 treatment was unable
to induce IL-17 expression in CD4+ T cells (2.3% versus 0.8%).
Similar to cytokines, LPS treatment increased the frequency of IL17–producing cells from 2.7% to 15.2% in CD4+ T cells. However,
coculture with lymphoma cells decreased LPS-mediated enhancement of IL-17 expression in CD4+ T cells from 15.2% to 7.6%. As a
control, we examined the effect of normal B cells on the generation
of TH17 cells. CD4+ cells, in the presence or absence of normal
CD19+ B cells, were stimulated with or without IL-1h plus IL-6 and

subjected to IL-17 intracellular staining. In the presence or absence
of normal B cells, treatment of IL-1h plus IL-6 induced a similar
number of IL-17–expressing cells (1.5% versus 5.8% and 1.8% versus
6.2%, respectively). These results further confirm that lymphoma
cells specifically suppress TH17 cell generation.
We next investigated the potential mechanisms that may account
for the interactions between lymphoma and intratumoral TH17
cells. In previous work, we have shown that costimulatory
molecules were involved in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma-mediated
Treg cell development (12). To test whether CD27-CD70 or CD28CD80/86 interactions were involved in non-Hodgkin’s lymphomamediated suppression of TH17 cells, we cocultured CD4+ T cells
isolated from tumor biopsy specimens in the presence or absence of
CD19+ lymphoma cells with or without blocking antibodies specific
to CD70, CD80, or CD86. As shown in Fig. 4C (top), T-cell activation
in the presence of mIgG (isotype control) significantly increased
IL-17 expression in CD4+ T cells in the absence of lymphoma cells.
Under the same culture conditions, treatment with CD70 or CD80 or
CD86 antibody had no effect on IL-17 expression in CD4+ T cells
when compared with isotype control. In the presence of lymphoma
cells, CD4+ T-cell activation modestly up-regulated IL-17 expression,
similar to the results shown in Fig. 4B. However, in the presence of
anti-CD70, CD80, or CD86 antibody, LPS-mediated up-regulation of
IL-17 was restored to that seen in CD4+ T cells cocultured without
lymphoma cells. These results confirmed an inhibitory effect of

lymphoma cells on TH17 cell generation and suggest that CD70,
CD80, and CD86 are involved in the process.
Effect of interruption of IL-2 signaling on TH17 cells in
B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Because IL-2 signaling plays a
critical role in the maintenance and activity of Treg cells (21) and is
also involved in the regulation of TH17 cells (22), we explored
whether inhibiting IL-2 affected TH17 cells. We therefore first
induced Foxp3 expression in CD4+ T cells from lymphoma
specimens by treating them with TGF-h (Fig. 5A). We found that
the TGF-h-mediated induction of Foxp3 in intratumoral CD4+ T
cells was completely abolished when the cells were treated with an
anti-IL-2 antibody, indicating that IL-2 is critically important in the
generation of Treg cells. We then determined whether the inhibition
of Treg generation by anti-IL-2 antibody results in the enhancement
of TH17 generation. As shown in Fig. 5B (top), blockade of IL-2 by
anti-IL-2 antibody increased IL-17 expression in CD4+ T cells,
suggesting that IL-2 is involved in the regulation of TH17 cell
generation. In addition to using an anti-IL-2 antibody, we also used
antibodies blocking IL-2Ra or IL-2Rh (Fig. 5B). Treatment with
anti-IL-2Ra (middle) or IL-2Rh (bottom) led to an increase in
CD4+ IL-17–producing cells. An increase in both IL-17+IFN-g- and
IL-17+IFN-g+ cells was seen after treatment with IL-2Ra and IL-2Rh
blocking antibodies. Taken together, these findings indicate that
activation of IL-2 signaling plays a role in the inhibition of TH17 cell
generation.

the absence or presence of IL-1h/IL-6 plus blocking antibody specific to IL-2
(aIL-2 ) or isotype control (IgG ; n = 3 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma samples).

We next wanted to test whether IL-2 contributed to lymphoma
cell-mediated inhibition of TH17 cell generation. We first confirmed
that lymphoma cells were able to produce IL-2 (Fig. 5C). We then
cultured CD4+ T cells in the presence of lymphoma cells with
IL-1h/IL-6 or with IL-1h/IL-6 plus an anti-IL-2 antibody. As shown

www.aacrjournals.org

in Fig. 5D, we again observed that stimulation with IL-1h/IL-6 was
not able to enhance IL-17 expression in CD4+ T cells when
cocultured with lymphoma cells. However, we found that the
number of IL-17–producing cells was increased when CD4+ T cells
were cocultured with lymphoma cells treated with an IL-2 blocking
antibody (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that IL-2 generated by
lymphoma cells is involved in the inhibition of TH17 cells.
Reciprocal regulation of TH17 and Treg cells in biopsy
specimens of B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It has been
shown that CpG-A (a type D CpG oligonucleotide) and LPS are able
to reverse the inhibitory activity of Treg cells (13, 23). We, therefore,
wanted to test whether the reversal of Treg cell function by CPG-A
or LPS resulted in the enhancement of TH17 cell numbers. As
shown in Fig. 6A, treatment with CpG-A, but not a scrambled CPGA control, enhanced IL-17 expression in CD4+ T cells (5.7% versus
3.3%; n = 3 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma samples). Similar findings
were observed in CD4+ T cells treated with LPS. The number of IL17+ T cells was increased in CD4+ T cells treated with LPS (6.4%
versus 3.8%; n = 5 non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma samples). Furthermore, we tested the effect of LPS-activated dendritic cells on IL-17
production by CD4+ T cells because LPS-matured dendritic cells
have been shown to be able to abrogate Treg cell suppressive
function (24, 25). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, coculture
with LPS-activated dendritic cells increased IL-17 production in
intratumoral CD4+ T cells. These results indicate that inhibition of
Treg cells is associated with enhanced generation of TH17 cells.
We also tested whether changes in Foxp3 expression correlated
with the number of IL-17–producing cells (Fig. 6B). CD4+ T cells
were treated with TGF-h in the presence or absence of IL-23, a
cytokine that has been shown to be able to promote TH17 cell
expansion and stained for IL-17 or Foxp3 expression. As shown in
Fig. 6B, treatment with TGF-h induced Foxp3 in CD4+ T cells and
this up-regulation of Foxp3 expression was reversed by IL-23,
consistent with other studies (26). Conversely, treatment with TGFh inhibited IL-17 expression in CD4+ T cells and this downregulation of IL-17 expression was relieved by IL-23. Similar results
were seen when CD4+ T cells were treated with anti-IL-2 antibody
(data not shown). These results indicate that the expression of
Foxp3 and IL-17 is reciprocally regulated in intratumoral CD4+
T cells.
Next, we determined whether a reverse correlation between Treg
and TH17 cells could be observed in vivo. As shown in Fig. 6C,
an increased number of Foxp3+ cells and a low number of IL-17+
cells were found in tonsils involved by non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
whereas a low number of Foxp3+ cells and a relatively high number
of IL-17+ cells were found in benign tonsils. Tonsil tissue was used
as a representative sample because it has a higher number of TH17
compared with other tissues (Supplementary Fig. S2). These in vivo
results supported our in vitro findings that the development of Treg
and TH17 cells was reciprocally regulated and, more importantly,
that substantially more inhibitory Treg cells were present in tumor
microenvironment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
We then compared the expression of Foxp3 and IL-17 in
intratumoral CD4+ T cells. The induction of Foxp3 or IL-17 in
intratumoral CD4+ T cells was calculated and converted to a
logarithmic number to distinguish the induction direction. We saw
a reciprocal expression pattern of Foxp3 (open dots) and IL-17 (dark
dots) in CD4+ T cells treated with different stimuli (Fig. 6D).
Treatment of CD4+ T cells with antibodies neutralizing IL-2 or
blocking IL-2Ra or IL-2Rh increased IL-17 production but
decreased Foxp3 expression. In contrast, stimulation with TGF-h

induced Foxp3 expression and inhibited IL-17 production in
intratumoral CD4+ T cells. Similarly, coculture with malignant B
cells resulted in up-regulation of Foxp3 expression and downregulation of IL-17 production.

Discussion
Although TH17 cells have been intensively studied in mouse
models of autoimmune and infectious diseases, there are very few
studies attempting to explore the role of TH17 cells in tumor
models either in mice or humans (16, 27–29). Previous studies
(16, 30–36) have found that expression levels of IL-17 mRNA or
protein differ in different types of tumors with the range from
undetectable to abundant. However, it is not clear in most of these
studies whether IL-17 detected in tumor tissues is produced by
TH17 cells. In the present study, we found that IL-17 production
was predominantly from TH17 cells. We also found that the
frequency of TH17 cells varies among specimens with a range from

undetectable to a considerable amount. When we quantified the
number of TH17 cells in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma biopsy specimens, we found a significantly low percentage of TH17 cells present
in lymphoma specimens. This led us to explore the underlying
mechanism that accounted for the low percentage of TH17 cells.
Although it has been convincingly shown that TGF-h plus IL-6
induces the development of murine TH17 cells, the development of
human TH17 cells turns out to be more complex due to inability of
TGF-h and IL-6 to induce TH17 cells in human tissues (37). Two
groups (7, 38) independently observed that IL-1h but not TGF-h
was essential for the differentiation of human IL-17–producing T
cells, and this has been confirmed in human tissues by several
studies (39–41). In this study in human B-cell lymphomas, we
found that TH17 cell generation can be induced in vitro by IL-1h
and/or IL-6, but not TGF-h, confirming the important role of
inflammatory cytokines in the development of TH17 cells. Although
TGF-h alone had little effect on the development of TH17 cells in
our samples, TGF-h was able to inhibit IFN-g expression in CD4+

Regulation of Tumor TH17 Cells

T cells including IL-17+ T cells induced by IL-1h/IL-6 and cleared
the population of IL-17+IFN-g+ cells. This resulted in a subset of IL17–producing cells similar to TH17 cells originally identified and
described in mice. In addition to TGF-h, attenuation of IFN-g
expression by anti-IFN-g antibody resulted in the disappearance of
the IL-17+IFN-g+ population and an enhancement of IL-17+IFN-g- T
cells, suggesting a reciprocal regulation between development of
TH1 and TH17 cells.
The underlying mechanism for the significantly low percentage
of TH17 cells present in lymphoma specimens is unknown. We
found that malignant transformation of B cells plays an important
role in CD4+ T-cell differentiation favoring Treg cells and leading to
down-regulation of TH17 cell generation. In the present study, we
found that lymphoma cells inhibited cytokine- and LPS-mediated
enhancement of TH17 cell generation accounting for the significantly low percentage of TH17 cells present in lymphoma specimens. Our results differ from those of a recent study that showed
that ovarian tumor cells promote TH17 cell generation by secreting
IL-1h and IL-6 (39). However, this report also showed that ovarian
tumor cells secreted TGF-h, thereby leading to an inhibition of
TH17 cell generation and an induction of Treg cells.
Interaction between costimulatory molecules and their ligands
plays an important role in T-cell differentiation and development.
Lymphoma B cells aberrantly express abundant CD70, CD80, or
CD86 when compared with normal B cells and interaction between
CD27-CD70 and CD28-CD80/86 is involved in the generation of Treg
cells (12, 42). Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of Treg
cells by blocking CD27-CD70 or CD28-CD80/86 interactions
between lymphoma cells and CD4+ T cells would be able to
promote TH17 cell generation. Our data clearly showed that the
administration of antibodies blocking the costimulatory molecules
CD70, CD80, or CD86 increased the number of IL-17–producing
cells.
The IL-2 signaling pathway has been shown to be critically
involved in the maintenance of the Treg cell phenotype and activity.
The role of the IL-2 signaling pathway in the generation of TH17
cells, however, is controversial. By using peripheral blood
mononuclear cells from healthy subjects and patients with scleritis
or uveitis, Amadi-Obi and colleagues found that IL-2 induced the

production of IL-17 in CD4+ T cells and contributed to the
progression of uveitis and scleritis (43). In contrast to this finding,
other reports showed that addition of exogenous IL-2 suppressed
the up-regulation of IL-17–producing cells mediated by TGF-h/
IL-6. Furthermore, IL-2 signaling interruption using an anti-lL-2
antibody resulted in the up-regulation of IL-17 expression in CD4+
T cells in a mouse model (16, 22), suggesting that IL-2 has a direct
inhibitory effect on TH17 generation. Supporting this finding, our
data clearly showed that interruption of IL-2 signaling enhanced
the up-regulation of cytokine-mediated IL-17 expression in intratumoral CD4+ T cells.
Throughout the experiments, we noted that the development
of Treg or TH17 cells in the non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma tumor
microenvironment was reciprocally regulated. Several factors
including cytokines (22, 44), retinoic acid (45), and rapamycin
(46) are able to mediate a reciprocal relationship between Treg and
TH17 cells. This relationship has been reported in patients with
acute coronary syndrome (47) and described in studies on synovial
fluid from children with arthritis (48). However, to the best of our
knowledge, this relationship has not been reported in any
malignancy. We have presented a line of evidence showing that
up-regulation of Treg cells was associated with down-regulation of
TH17 and vice versa. These findings confirmed that the development of Treg and TH17 cells is reciprocally regulated and, more
importantly, that lymphoma B cells generate an inhibitory
environment that favors the development of Treg cells rather than
TH17 cells. This lack of TH17 cells may therefore contribute to the
suboptimal immune response in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
