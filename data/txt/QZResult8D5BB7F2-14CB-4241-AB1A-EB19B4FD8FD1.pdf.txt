ABSTRACT:
Acquired chemotherapy resistance is a major contributor to treatment failure
in oncology. For example, the efficacy of the common anticancer agent doxorubicin
(DOX) is limited by the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in cancer
cells. While dose escalation of DOX can circumvent such resistance to a degree, this
is precluded by the appearance of cardiotoxicity, a particularly debilitating condition
in children. In vitro studies have established the ability of the natural phytochemical
curcumin to overcome MDR; however, its widespread clinical application is restricted
by poor solubility and low bioavailability. Building upon our recently developed
polymer nanoparticle of curcumin (NanoCurc or NC) that significantly enhances
the systemic bioavailability of curcumin, we synthesized a doxorubicin-curcumin
composite nanoparticle formulation called NanoDoxCurc (NDC) for overcoming
DOX resistance. Compared to DOX alone, NDC inhibited the MDR phenotype and
caused striking growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo in several models of DOXresistant cancers (multiple myeloma, acute leukemia, prostate and ovarian cancers,
respectively). Notably, NDC-treated mice also demonstrated complete absence of
cardiac toxicity, as assessed by echocardiography, or any bone marrow suppression,
even at cumulative dosages where free DOX and pegylated liposomal DOX (Doxil®)
resulted in demonstrable attenuation of cardiac function and hematological toxicities.
This improvement in safety profile was achieved through a reduction of DOX-induced
intracellular oxidative stress, as indicated by total glutathione levels and glutathione
peroxidase activity in cardiac tissue. A composite DOX-curcumin nanoparticle that
overcomes both MDR-based DOX chemoresistance and DOX-induced cardiotoxicity
holds promise for providing lasting and safe anticancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

formulation of curcumin (NanoCurc or NC) that
significantly enhances the systemic bioavailability of
this agent [33-35]. In order to harness the ability of
curcumin in suppressing MDR and thus improve DOX
efficacy in resistant cancer models, we synthesized a
composite polymer nanoparticle of DOX and curcumin
called ‘NanoDoxCurc’ (NDC) (Fig. S1). Our results
confirm that curcumin encapsulated in a DOX-conjugated
polymer nanoparticle can overcome DOX resistance in a
variety of human and murine cancer cell lines in vitro as
well as in vivo. Notably, we also find that systemic NDC
shows no evidence of cardiotoxicity or bone marrow
suppression, even at cumulative dosages at which such
demonstrable adverse effects are readily observed in free
DOX or Doxil®-treated mice, thus overcoming some of
the greatest limitations of DOX-based chemotherapy.

Resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is a
major impediment to a successful chemotherapeutic
regimen. Cancer cells acquire drug resistance through
a variety of mechanisms, not all of which are fully
understood. Examples include host and tumor genetic
alterations, epigenetic changes, changes in the tumor
microenvironment, modification of the drug’s cellular
target, or blocking the drug’s entry into the cell [1, 2].
Single drug resistant cells are often cross-resistant to
other structurally and functionally different drugs, a
phenomenon known as multidrug resistance (MDR) [3].
One key cause of acquired multidrug resistance is through
energy-dependent efflux of cytotoxic agents through any
of a 48-member family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters [2, 4, 5]. Such transmembrane efflux pumps,
including MDR1 and MRP1, aid in tumor cell survival by
actively removing chemotherapeutic agents from the cell’s
cytoplasm.
Resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs such
as anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, RNA-transporter
inhibitors, and microtubule-stabilizing drugs can be
associated with either single or multiple ABC transporters
[6, 7]. For instance, resistance of metastatic tumors to
the anthracycline doxorubicin (DOX) has been linked to
overexpression of ABC transporters ABCB1 (MDR1/Pglycoprotein) [7], ABCC1 (MRP1) [8], ABCC2 (MRP2)
[9, 10] and ABCG2 (MXR, BRCP) [11-13]. While dose
escalation can circumvent treatment resistance to some
degree, severe side effects including cardiotoxicity and
bone marrow suppression limit the cumulative tolerable
dose in patients. At a cumulative dose of 550 mg/m2 of
DOX, 26% of patients develop congestive heart failure
(CHF) [14], a condition that is lethal in approximately
50% of cases. The rate of CHF is further increased in
pediatric patients, with the frequency of CHF in pediatric
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients, for
example, as high as 57% [15-17].
Towards the goal of overcoming multidrug
resistance, several synthetic small molecules and
antibodies targeted against MDR proteins have been tested
in vitro and in vivo [18-22]; however, these inhibitors
have largely failed in clinical trials due to toxicity and
low serum stability [2]. Natural products are gaining
attention in MDR inhibition due to their low cytotoxicity
profiles. For example, the role of the phytochemical
curcumin (derived from Curcuma longa) in inhibiting
multiple MDR pumps in cancer cells has been widely
studied [23-29], including in combination with DOX [30,
31]. Despite its promise, the full potential of treatments
utilizing curcumin, either alone or in combination with
chemotherapeutic drugs has not been realized in the clinic,
primarily due to the poor systemic bioavailability of free
curcumin outside the tubular lower GI tract [32].
We have recently developed a polymer nanoparticle

MATERIALS AND METHODS
All small-animal experiments described conformed
to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee
of the Johns Hopkins University. Mice were maintained
in accordance with the guidelines of the American
Association of Laboratory Animal Care. The doxorubicin
resistant clones NCI/ADR and P388/ADR were obtained
from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD).
The National Cancer Institute uses DNA fingerprinting
for cell line authentication. PC-3A and parental PC-3
were the generous gift of Dr. William G. Nelson (Johns
Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), who generated the
DOX-resistant clone [36]. RPMI8226/Dox and parental
RPMI8226 were the generous gifts of Dr. William S.
Dalton (Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL) who generated
the DOX-resistant clone [37], and William Matsui (Johns
Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), respectively. DNA
fingerprinting was used to authenticate cell lines not
received directly from the NCI. All cells were cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
pen/strep.

Synthesis of NanoDoxCurc (NDC)
Doxorubicin was covalently grafted to the
carboxylic acid residue of NVA622 polymer to make
‘NanoDox’ (ND). NVA622 polymer (200 mg) and EDCI
(40 mg) were dissolved in distilled water (20 mL) and
stirred for 30 min at room temperature. Doxorubicin
(0.80 mg, 20 mg/mL in DMSO) was added to the reaction
mixture and stirred for 6 h. The resulting reaction mixture
was dialyzed for 12 h with exchange of fresh water every
2 h. The purified product (ND; DOX 1.4 μg/mg polymer
in vitro, 2.5 μg/mg polymer in vivo) was lyophilized for
use. Curcumin was encapsulated within the inner shell
of ND or NVA622 as described previously [33] to make
‘NanoDoxCurc’ (NDC; curcumin 10 μg/mg polymer)

or ‘NanoCurc’ (NC; curcumin 15 μg/mg polymer),
respectively. The final concentration of drug was measured
colorimetrically. For all in vitro studies, ND and NDC
were reconstituted in cell culture medium to yield 25
μM DOX and 271 μM curcumin. NC was resuspended to
yield 305 μM curcumin. For in vivo studies, drugs were
reconstituted in sterile PBS.

were analyzed in a BD FACSCalibur.

Soft-Agar Assay
1×104 cells were treated with ND, NDC, NC
or medium alone for 2 h. Cells were washed and
resuspended in 2 mL complete medium with 0.7% agar.
This suspension was layered on solidified 2 mL base agar
mixture of serum supplemented media and 1% agar on
a 6-well plate. Subsequently, the plates were incubated
at 37°C with 5 % CO2 for 14 days to allow for colony
growth. The plates were then stained and colonies counted
on ChemiDoc XRS instrument (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
Results are presented relative to the number of viable cells
by cell survival assay.

Trafficking of DOX into nucleus
Cells were seeded in 2-chambered slides one day
prior to treatment. The next day either NDC or ND
reconstituted in cell culture medium (500 μL/chamber,
10 mg/mL) were added to the appropriate chambers.
After 2 h of treatment, medium was discarded, cells were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, counterstained
with DAPI, mounted, and examined using a confocal
microscope (Zeiss) at 1000X final magnification.

Xenograft Studies
Flanks of 5-6 week old male athymic nu/nu mice
(Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) were injected with
5×106 PC-3A or RPMI8226/Dox cells suspended in a total
volume of 200 μL [PBS/Matrigel (BD Biosciences), 1:1
(v/v), pre-chilled to 4°C]. After one week, twenty mice
per tumor type with successfully engrafted xenografts
were randomized into four cohorts of five animals each
and administered i.p. (i) vehicle, (ii) ND (6 mg/kg DOX
equivalent), (iii) NC (30 mg/kg curcumin equivalent), or
(iv) NDC (6 mg/kg DOX equivalent; 24 mg/kg curcumin

Rhodamine Exclusion Assay
Cells were seeded in a 6 well plate at 1.5×105 cells
per well and cultured overnight. The next day, media was
changed to either 600 μL of cell culture medium or 600
μL of ND, NDC, or NC reconstituted as described above
for 2 h. The cells were further incubated in fresh medium
supplemented with 200 nM TMRM for 20 min. At the end
of incubation, the cells were trypsinized, and suspended in
PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 2% FBS. The samples

P388/Dox Ascites

4-5 week old C57BL/6J mice (5 mice per arm;
Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) were injected
intravenously with free DOX, Doxil, ND, NDC or PBS at
9mg/kg doxorubicin equivalent once weekly for 4 weeks.
One week following the last injection echocardiography
was performed and blood was collected by cardiac
puncture. Heart tissue was harvested and snap frozen.

P388/Dox DOX-resistant ascites were implanted
intraperitoneally in two B6D2F1 (BDF1) mice (6 weeks,
Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN). After 7 days,
ascitic fluid was collected via syringe and injected into 24
BDF1 mice. The following day, mice were randomized
into three arms receiving daily either (i) ND at a dose of
6 mg/kg DOX equivalent, (ii) NDC at a dose of 6 mg/kg

expressing high levels of distinct MDR proteins - MDR1
and MRP1 (Fig. S2a). Two of the parental cell lines (PC-3,
RPMI8226) were available as controls.
We initially assessed whether the curcumincontaining NDC formulation allowed accumulation of
DOX inside the nucleus as measured by doxorubicin
fluorescence. In parental, non-DOX resistant cell lines
ND co-localized with DAPI as expected, indicating
accumulation of ND inside the nucleus (Fig. S2b). When
resistant NCI/ADR, PC-3A, and RPMI8226/Dox cell
lines were treated with ND alone, very little nuclear
DOX fluorescence signal was observed, indicating poor
nuclear accumulation of DOX (Fig. 1a, Left Panel).
In stark contrast, treatment with NDC dramatically
induced nuclear accumulation in DOX resistant cell lines,
indicating the ability of co-treatment with curcumin to
promote nuclear uptake of DOX (Fig. 1a, Right Panel).
To further confirm the ability of curcumin to
reduce drug resistance by inhibiting drug effusion,
we evaluated the exclusion of rhodamine dye by flow
cytometry, a standard assay to assess MDR function [38],
in MDR1- and MRP1-expressing RPMI8226/Dox and
MRP1-expressing PC-3A cell lines. As seen in untreated
controls, rhodamine dye is very efficiently removed from
the cytoplasm (Fig. 1b). In both cell lines, treatment

RESULTS
NDC formulation overcomes MDR pump induced
DOX efflux in vitro
A composite formulation of DOX and curcumin
was synthesized by covalently conjugating DOX to the
carboxylic acid moiety on the surface of the amphiphilic
polymer (NanoDox; ND), followed by encapsulating
curcumin within its hydrophobic core (NanoDoxCurc;
NDC) (Fig. S1). To test the ability of NDC to overcome
MDR, thus allowing DOX to accumulate in the cell and be
trafficked to the nucleus, we chose three independent DOX
resistant human cancer cell lines (NCI/ADR [ovarian], PC-

overcome ABC transporter function in MDR cell lines.

of RPMI8226/Dox xenografts indicated greatly reduced
expression of MDR1 in NC- and NDC-treated xenografts
(Fig. 2c,d).
In a syngeneic model of DOX resistance, we
evaluated whether NDC increases the survival of wildtype BDF1 mice injected intraperitoneally with murine
P388/ADR DOX-resistant ascites (Fig. 2e). The P388/
ADR is a highly aggressive DOX resistant clone derived
from a murine acute leukemia [39]. Treatment with ND
showed no survival benefit over vehicle controls, with
both groups showing a median survival of approximately 8
days. In contrast, a significant increase in median survival
of greater than 50% was observed upon treatment with
NDC, with mice surviving a median of 13 days (p<0.005).

NDC significantly reduces viability and clonogenic
growth of DOX-resistant human cancer cells
To test whether the NDC formulation increases
the cytotoxic effects of DOX in DOX-resistant clones,
we evaluated cell viability following treatment with ND,
NC and NDC for 48 hours. All three lines were nearly
completely refractory to ND alone, and only minimal
sensitivity to NC was observed in PC-3A and RPMI8226/
Dox. In contrast, NDC treatment resulted in significant
decreases in proliferation in all three DOX-resistant
cell lines (Fig. S2c). In a similar fashion, treatment with
NDC significantly reduced clonogenicity, with ND alone
showing only mild to moderate decreases in colony count
in PC-3A (Fig. 1c,d). Interestingly, NC alone showed
greater potency than ND in all three DOX-resistant cell
lines.

Systemic NDC and ND exhibit minimal
cardiotoxicity and bone marrow suppression as
compared to Doxorubicin and Doxil®
A major dose limiting factor for DOX-based
regimens in the clinic is the development of cardiotoxicity,
especially in the pediatric population. We compared the
toxicities of both the ND and NDC formulations with
those of free DOX and Doxil®, a commercially available
pegylated liposomal formulation of DOX. C57BL/6 wildtype mice were injected intravenously with buffered
saline, free DOX, Doxil, ND, or NDC once every week for
4 weeks at comparable cumulative dosages (9 mg/kg DOX
equivalent). One week after the last dose, cardiac function
of the mice was measured by echocardiography (Fig.
3a). DOX and Doxil®-treated mice showed a significant
increase in all of the assessed parameters considered
detrimental to cardiac function, including left ventricular
end systolic dimension (LVESD), interventricular septal
wall thickness at end diastole (IVSD), left ventricular
posterior wall thickness at end diastole (LVPWTD); the
results of which were an objective decrease of fractional
shortening (FS), and ejection fraction (EF) in both cohorts.
In contrast, mice treated with ND, and in particular those
receiving NDC, demonstrated minimal evidence of the
aforementioned signs of cardiotoxicty, as compared to free
DOX or Doxil® (Fig. 3b). In fact, the echocardiographic
parameters were essentially overlapping in NDC and
vehicle-treated mice.
Both DOX and Doxil® treatment substantially
reduced mouse body weight and heart weight by more
than 40% (Fig. 3c); however, ND- and NDC-treated mice
showed no significant change in body and heart weight
relative to controls. Blood samples were collected from
experimental animals by cardiac puncture, and hearts were
collected for histological analysis and molecular studies.
Hemoglobin (Hb) levels dropped from an average of 12.5
g/dL in control mice to an average of 7.5 g/dL in DOXtreated mice, and lymphocyte counts were significantly
reduced in Doxil®-treated animals, indicating both anemia

NDC significantly inhibits the growth of DOXresistant human tumor xenografts and improves
survival of mice bearing syngeneic leukemic
ascites
PC-3A and RPMI8226/Dox DOX-resistant clones
were implanted subcutaneously in the right flank of
athymic nude mice, and treated with vehicle, ND, NC,
or NDC. In vivo nuclear accumulation of DOX was
measured by fluorescence microscopy in formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded RPMI8226/Dox xenograft sections
(Fig. 2a). The presence of DOX was observed in the
cytoplasmic compartment in ND-treated xenografts;
however, marked nuclear accumulation of DOX was
only observed in sections from NDC-treated tumors.
In both xenograft models, treatment with either ND
or NC alone significantly reduced the rate of growth
of tumor by approximately 50% (p<0.05 and p<0.01,
respectively). Demonstrating the benefit of the composite
formulation, treatment with NDC yielded a greater than
90% reduction in tumor growth (Fig. 2b) (p<0.005; vs. all
other treatment groups). Importantly, the body weight of
animals treated with ND or NDC for 2-3 weeks was not
significantly different as compared to controls, suggesting
a favorable toxicity profile at therapeutically relevant
doses (Fig. S3a). Histological analysis of sections from
treated tumors in both models showed significant necrotic
regions in NDC-treated tumors, and to a lesser extent
in NC-treated cases (Fig. S3b,c). Additionally, staining
for the cell proliferation marker Ki67 showed markedly
lower proliferation in RPMI8226/Dox xenografts treated
with NDC as compared to ND, NC, or untreated control
(Fig. S3d). Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis

and severe lymphocytopenia (Fig. 3d). By contrast, there
were no significant alterations in hematological parameters
in ND- and NDC-treated mice compared to vehicle
controls, indicating minimal bone marrow suppression.
Histological assays and TUNEL staining were also
performed on heart cryosections to examine for indications
of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and cardiomyopathy.
Toluidine blue-stained heart sections from DOX and
Doxil®-treated animals demonstrated widespread lesions
consistent with acute cardiomyopathy in these groups (Fig.
4a, arrows). In contrast, sections from ND- and NDCtreated mice were indistinguishable from those of vehicletreated controls. Additionally, analysis of H&E stained
sections revealed the presence of hypertrophic cardiac
cells—characterized by elongated nuclei—in both DOXand Doxil®-treated mice; however, no such lesions were
found in sections from ND and NDC groups (Fig. 4b).
Finally, TUNEL staining indicated widespread apoptosis
in cardiac cells in both DOX- and Doxil®-treated mice. In
contrast, few apoptotic cells were observed in ND treated
mice, and no apoptotic cells were observed in NDC and
vehicle treated groups (Fig. 4c).
The underlying basis for cardiomyocyte damage
with DOX exposure is considered to be aberrant
intracellular oxidative stress, due to DOX-induced
reactive oxygen species (ROS) [40]. Our recent studies
with nanoparticulate curcumin have confirmed its ability
to ameliorate oxidative damage to non-neoplastic tissues,
such as in hepatocytes and neuronal cells [34, 35], through
induction of a favorable intracellular redox environment.
To evaluate the degree of oxidative stress in treated mice,
total glutathione levels, and activity of the antioxidant
glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were quantified using lysates
prepared from cardiac tissues. In both DOX- and Doxil®treated groups, cardiac glutathione levels were nearly
undetectable (Fig. 4d; p<0.05). In contrast, glutathione
levels in both ND- and NDC-treated groups were not
significantly different than in untreated mice (p=0.5).
Further, only the NDC-treated mice showed significantly
higher levels of GPx activity than all other treatment
groups (Fig. 4e), underscoring the enhanced anti-oxidant
capacity resulting from the inclusion of curcumin
concurrently with DOX in the composite formulation.

of a highly-bioavailable nanoparticle-encapsulated
formulation of curcumin (NanoCurc) [33], we sought to
develop a composite curcumin-doxorubicin nanoparticle,
NanoDoxCurc (NDC), which could overcome MDR
protein function and provide more efficacious therapy
for patients in an important step forward in improving
overall cancer survival. As an additional benefit, curcumin,
which is known to induce a favorable intracellular redox
environment [42], might be expected to reduce cardiac
toxicity in such a composite nanoparticle, opening the
possibility of increased safety at higher cumulative doses
of DOX.
Following the synthesis of NDC by covalent
modification of the existing NanoCurc (NC) formulation,
we began investigating the in vitro effects of this
composite nanoparticle. We observed that curcumin
strongly repressed the MDR phenotype in DOX-resistant
cancer cell lines that constitutively overexpress the MDR
proteins MDR1 and MRP1, allowing robust nuclear
uptake of DOX. This was in contrast to the previously
described DOX nuclear exclusion pattern characteristic
of MDR cells, which was observed in ND-treated cells
[43]. The inhibition of the MDR phenotype by NDC was
accompanied by significant decreases in both in vitro cell
viability and colony formation on soft agar. Of note, we
observed the improved efficacy of NDC over ND in cancer
lines with distinct patterns of MDR protein overexpression
(MDR1 or MRP1, respectively), underscoring the
potentially broad utility of this strategy across cancer
types.
Based on the in vitro data, we next assessed the
efficacy of the NDC formulation in vivo using DOXresistant human cancer xenografts. Compared to
vehicle, NC, or ND alone, NDC significantly inhibited
subcutaneous tumor growth in PC-3A and RPMI8226/
Dox xenografts, yet the treated mice showed no evidence
of toxicity, maintaining body weight and demonstrating
no overt behavioral changes throughout the duration
of treatment. Interestingly, while both ND and NC
each showed a degree of tumor growth inhibition, the
composite nanoparticle NDC showed nearly complete
growth inhibition (>90%) over the duration of the study.
Comparable nuclear DOX uptake patterns to those
observed in vitro were found in NDC-treated xenografts,
indicating the suppression of MDR phenotype in vivo
by curcumin, which was also confirmed by ex vivo
immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis of treated
tumors. To further evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of
NDC, we utilized BDF1 wild-type mice injected with
MDR-overexpressing P388 DOX-resistant ascites [44],
which is a more biologically relevant preclinical model
than subcutaneous xenografts. As expected, this model
was completely refractory to ND treatment, with no
observed change in survival. In contrast, treatment with
NDC markedly increased the median survival by more
than 50% as compared to ND or vehicle treatment.

DISCUSSION
Multiple drug resistance caused by overexpression
of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters is a major
impediment in cancer chemotherapy [2]. Current
approaches to overcome MDR include a focus on drug
discovery, with, in many cases, an end goal of combination
therapy [2]. Although multiple lines of evidence have
established curcumin as an inhibitor of ABC-transporter
function [31, 41], its use in vivo has been limited by
the poor systemic bioavailability of this hydrophobic
small molecule. Following our recent development

Taken together these results demonstrate the ability of
nanoparticle-delivered curcumin to effectively overcome
MDR in vivo by inhibiting ABC-transporter expression,
restoring the otherwise excellent therapeutic efficacy of
DOX in a variety of clinically relevant model systems.
In the treatment of malignancies with DOX,
the occurrence of cardiotoxicity is dose-dependent,
limiting the cumulative dose a patient may receive, and
thus limiting the therapeutic efficacy of the drug [45].
Because the mechanism of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity
is independent of its mechanism of action in tumors
[40], there exists the potential to selectively block the
systemic toxicity of DOX without affecting its therapeutic
benefit. We postulated that a composite nanoparticle
formulation of DOX and curcumin (NDC) would not only
circumvent the MDR phenotype in tumor cells, but also
attenuate oxidative stress induced damage in extra-tumoral
tissues, such as the heart. To evaluate this hypothesis, we
investigated the cardiotoxicity of NDC in a model of high
cumulative dose toxicity in C57BL/6 wild-type mice as
evaluated by echocardiography. Mice treated with either
DOX or Doxil® showed unequivocal signs of decrease
in cardiac function. In particular, significant decreases
in both ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening
(FS) were observed, key clinical indicators of impaired
myocardial function [15, 45]. In contrast, mice treated with
comparable cumulative dosages of ND or NDC showed
minimal impairment of cardiac function, as assessed by
echocardiographic parameters. Similarly, hemoglobin
and leukocyte counts were found to be reduced by DOX
and Doxil®; in contrast, both ND and NDC treated mice
showed counts similar to controls, indicating absence
of bone marrow suppression as well. One possible
explanation for the protection afforded is that curcumin
causes cell cycle arrest in bone marrow cells, sparing them
from the cyctotoxic effects of DOX in a manner analogous
to cyclotherapy [46, 47]. Further studies are required to
fully elucidate the mechanism by which NDC spares
mice from bone marrow suppression; however, such an
approach would be of high clinical utility.
As the major mechanism of doxorubicin-induced
cardiotoxicity is oxidative stress [40, 45], we evaluated
glutathione levels and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)
activity in cardiac tissue. Not surprisingly, reduced
glutathione levels were observed in cardiac tissue of DOXand Doxil®-treated mice, indicating that both treatments
induce oxidative stress within cardiomyocytes and
depleted intracellular anti-oxidant reserves. In contrast,
ND- and NDC-treated mice maintained glutathione levels
comparable to that observed in untreated mice, while an
additional indicator of enhanced anti-oxidant function—
namely, increased GPx activity—was observed solely in
the NDC-treated mice. Thus, nanoencapsulation of DOX
(i.e., ND) is sufficient to provide a reasonable degree of
cardioprotection compared to comparable dosages of free
DOX or Doxil®, but it is only the composite formulation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(NDC) that induces both a favorable redox environment in
non-neoplastic tissues, while concomitantly overcoming
therapeutic resistance in the neoplastic cells.
In conclusion, we have designed a composite
polymeric nanoparticle, which has doxorubicin covalently
bound to the surface of the nanoparticle, and curcumin
encapsulated within its hydrophobic core. Due to the
presence of curcumin, a potent inhibitor of MDR, this
composite nanoparticle (NDC) can unequivocally
overcome multidrug resistance as demonstrated in multiple
in vivo models of DOX-resistant human and murine
cancers. Additionally, NDC shows significantly reduced
cardiotoxicity in mice receiving high cumulative doses of
DOX, due to the attenuation of oxidative stress in systemic
tissues by curcumin. Such composite nanoparticles have
great promise for clinical translation, as they directly
address multiple challenges by both overcoming resistance
and enhancing safety, effectively “killing two birds with
one stone”.
