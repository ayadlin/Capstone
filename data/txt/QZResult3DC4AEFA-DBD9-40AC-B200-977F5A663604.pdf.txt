Abstract

Author Manuscript

A hallmark of human cancer is heterogeneity, reflecting the complex series of changes resulting in
the activation of oncogenes coupled with inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Breast cancer is
no exception and indeed, many studies have revealed considerable complexity and heterogeneity
in the population of primary breast tumors and substantial changes in a recurrent breast tumor that
has acquired drug resistance. We have made use of a Myc-inducible transgenic mouse model of
breast cancer in which elimination of Myc activity following tumor development initially leads to
a regression of a subset of tumors generally followed by de novo Myc-independent growth. We
have observed that tumors that grow independent of MYC expression have gene profiles and
histologies that are distinct from the primary tumors and have acquired features resembling
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and “tumor initiating” cells. Analyses of the genetic
pathways underlying these histological changes revealed a strong correlation between activation of
the Ras, TGFβ, and TNFα pathways with Myc-independent growth. Collectively, the data reveal
genetic alterations that underlie an escape from Myc-dependent growth and tumor progression that
may parallel what occurs in human cancers as they acquire drug resistance.

Introduction
Human cancer, including breast cancer, is characterized by genetic complexity reflecting the
acquisition of multiple mutations, amplifications, deletions, and gene arrangements over a
period of time. Recent genome-scale studies of copy number variation and large-scale DNA
sequencing efforts have provided direct evidence for this complexity (Ding et al., 2008;
Mullighan et al., 2007; Sjoblom et al., 2006; Weir et al., 2007). This heterogeneity is
manifested in the primary tumors that exhibit considerable patient to patient variation that
determines disease outcome and response to therapies as well as in the recurrent tumors that
may additionally acquire the ability to metastasize to distant organs. An ability to model the
complexity that gives rise to tumor heterogeneity is thus essential to understanding the
oncogenic process and would enable the development of additional therapeutics to target
cancers that evade conventional therapy.

Mouse models genetically engineered to explore the concept of oncogene addiction have
guided our understanding of the genetic complexity underlying the progression of cancers.
Prior work using transgenic mouse models that conditionally overexpress the MYC
oncogene has shown that inactivation of MYC can be sufficient to induce sustained tumor
regression. Particularly in lymphomas, islet cell tumors and skin tumors, withdrawal of
MYC expression resulted in rapid tumor cell elimination through apoptosis (Pelengaris et
al., 2002). Similarly, MYC inactivation in osteogenic sarcoma resulted in terminal
differentiation of tumor cells into mature bone cells resulting in cells that no longer have
tumorgenic potential (Jain et al., 2002). While tumor initiation and progression in these
systems appeared to be dependent on a single oncogenic event, more recent mouse models
of MYC-induced epithelial cancers have exhibited a more complex situation apparently
reflecting the action of multiple oncogenic events (Boxer et al., 2004; D’Cruz et al., 2001;
Moody et al., 2005; Shachaf et al., 2004). In a majority of these studies, inactivation of the
oncogene resulted in regression of only a subset of the tumors. Tumors that initially
regressed, showing a dependence on a specific oncogenic pathway, generally recurred
exhibiting acquired resistance to pathway inhibition similar to what is observed during the
course of human cancers. Additional studies employing models that combine inducible Myc
and Ras oncogenes have described further complexity with evidence of a hierarchy of
oncogene dependence (Podsypanina et al., 2008). The evident heterogeneity observed in
these transgenic mice that conditionally overexpress an oncogene or oncogenes with respect
to dependency on the initiating event suggests that these models can serve to reveal the
complexities of the oncogenic process.

Author Manuscript

A particularly powerful approach to the study of genomic complexities that underlie these
complex phenotypes has been the use of whole genome expression analyses. Our previous
work has made use of patterns of gene expression, as well as patterns of pathway activity
revealed using signatures of pathway activation, to identify heterogeneity of tumors within
mouse models. We have further explored this heterogeneity, now in the context of the
genomic alterations that occur to allow tumors to lose dependence on the initial oncogene
activating event similar to how human cancers may acquire drug resistance.

Results
Genomic Analysis of Primary and Myc-independent Tumors
The transgenic line MMTV-rtTA (MTB) carries the reverse tetracycline-dependent
transcriptional activator, rtTA, under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus
(MMTV). When mated to mice carrying the c-MYC transgene fused to a tetracyclinedependent promoter (TetO-Myc )(TOM), bitransgenic animals (MTB/TOM) are produced in
which Myc is induced in the presence of doxycycline, resulting in the development of
adenocarcinomas with 100% penetrance. Tumors that develop are heterogeneneous since
previous work has shown that upon withdrawal of doxycycline, approximately half of the
adenocarcinomas regressed while the remaining half persisted independent of MYC
expression(Boxer et al., 2004).

Author Manuscript

We induced 35 mice with doxycycline and consistent with previous observations,
chronically induced MTB/TOM developed mammary tumors with a mean latency of 21.8
weeks (Boxer et al., 2004; D’Cruz et al., 2001). From these 35 mice, we observed a total of
43 tumors. Upon withdrawal of doxycycline, 17 out of 43 (40%) tumors regressed to a
nonpalpable state while the remaining 26 tumors (60%) showed variable degrees of
regression but did not reach a nonpalpable state (Figure 1B). Tumors that regressed to a
nonpalpable state generally recurred within 1–6 months and mice were euthanized when
tumors reached >1cm3. Among the tumors that did not reach a nonpalpable state, 16/43
(37%) tumors showed variable degrees of regression (from >90% regression where the
tumor was barely palpable to less than 10% reduction in tumor volume) and resumed growth
within 1–2 months. The remaining 10/43 tumors (23%) showed no signs of regression and
either remained dormant or continued to grow.

As an approach to the analysis of the genomic changes that might underlie the differential
outcome following elimination of Myc, we utilized genome-scale gene expression analysis.
We assessed gene expression profiles on Affymetrix 430A.2 gene expression arrays of 37
out of 43 tumors collected when the mice were administered doxycycline (hereon referred to
as the “primary” tumors) and 38 tumors that recurred or continued to grow after doxycycline
withdrawal (hereon referred to as the “Myc-independent” tumors) (Figure 1A). As a starting
point of our analyses, we first confirmed that MYC expression was tightly controlled by
doxycycline, by comparing MYC pathway activity using a Myc gene expression signature
that had previously been generated in our lab and validated on independent mouse data
sets(Bild et al., 2006; Gatza et al.; Huang et al., 2003). The advantage of utilizing gene
expression signatures is the ability to assess gene patterns represented by a collection of
genes related to MYC expression thus offering an assessment of MYC activity rather than
just MYC expression. Pathway analysis of the primary tumors showed high MYC activity
when mice were still on doxycycline, as shown in Figure 1C. MYC pathway activity was
diminished in recurrent tumors collected when the mice were off doxycycline with the
exception of two tumors (238A and 279A). Not surprisingly, both of these tumors did not
regress to a nonpalpable state following removal of doxycycline, consistent with continued
MYC function. Although we have not looked further into the underlying cause of
constitutive high MYC activity in these tumors, Podsypanina et al had previously reported

the acquisition of spontaneous somatic mutations in the rtTA transgene cDNA resulting in
the enhanced ability of the rtTA to bind and constitutively activate the tetO promoter
(Podsypanina et al., 2008). We speculate that this may be a possible explanation for the high
MYC activity we observe in these tumors.

Author Manuscript

Numerous studies have documented the synergistic actions of MYC and mutant Kras2 in
mammary tumorgenesis (Andrechek et al., 2009; Boxer et al., 2004; D’Cruz et al., 2001;
Podsypanina et al., 2008). In principle, Ras activation could be an explanation for the
development of Myc independence in a fraction of the tumors. To address this possibility,
we sequenced the mutational hot spots in Kras2 (codons 12, 13, and 61 of exons 1 and 2).
Sequence analyses reveal mutations in Kras2 in 49% of total tumors analyzed (Table 1).
Among tumors that regressed to a nonpalpable state 35% of tumors harbored Kras mutations
while tumors that regressed but were still palpable and tumors that were either dormant or
continued growing after removal of Myc harbored K-ras mutations in 44% and 80% of
tumors, respectively. A majority of the mutations were observed in codon 12 with the
exception of two tumors with mutations in codon 61. The amino acid changes in the
mutations varied with a majority of them being a glycine to aspartic acid mutation.
Mutations in Kras2 that were observed in the primary tumor samples were also observed in
the recurring tumors thus confirming that the tumors represent bona fide recurrences rather
than de novo neoplasms. Four of the primary tumors (B114-4, B169, B179 and B233) that
did not initially have mutations in Kras2 eventually acquired mutations in Kras2 when the
tumors were collected upon necropsy. Our results suggest that although Kras mutation status
initially plays a role in Myc-independent growth, additional genetic alterations have to also
be involved since all tumors eventually thrive independent of MYC expression.

Cluster Analysis Segregate Mouse Mammary Tumors that Escape Dependence on Myc
The Myc-induced mammary tumors from the MTB/TOM mouse model, although initiated
by one oncogenic event, showed variable responses to withdrawal of Myc expression likely
reflecting additional alterations acquired in the tumors. To determine whether differential
responses to Myc withdrawal is reflected in specific gene expression patterns dictating
tumor outcome, we performed an unsupervised clustering of the microarray data we
obtained from all the mouse mammary tumors. As shown in Figure 2A, there was a very
clear distinction in gene expression patterns between the primary tumors initiated by Myc
compared to tumors that recur or persist in the absence of Myc transgene expression (Figure
2A).

Author Manuscript

To further characterize the mammary tumors we obtained from the MTB/TOM mouse
model, we performed an unsupervised clustering again with tumors we previously
characterized from a mouse model that constitutively expressed Myc (MMTV-MYC). Our
prior work has described considerable heterogeneity in tumors from this MMTV-Myc
mouse model as distinct gene expression patterns that correlated with distinct histological
subtypes (Andrechek et al., 2009). Mammary tumors with papillary and microacinar
histological types clustered in a group together apart from the EMT/squamous tumors. An
EMT tumor signature that was generated from this data was shown to identify human breast
tumors that were likely to metastasize. As shown in Figure 2B, cluster analysis revealed a

majority of the MTB/TOM primary tumors clustered most closely with the previously
characterized microacinar tumors while the Myc-independent tumors primarily clustered
with the previously characterized EMT and squamous tumors.
Analysis of EMT Markers in Myc-independent Tumors

Author Manuscript

Previous studies with Her2/neu-induced mammary tumors have observed that tumors
recurring independent of Her2/neu transgene expression generally exhibited EMT type
histologies(Moody et al., 2005). The unsupervised clustering analysis presented in Figure 2
panel B provides evidence that the Myc independent tumors are genetically distinct from the
primary tumors and cluster with tumors that exhibit an EMT/squamous phenotype. To
further confirm that the distinction in gene patterns reflects acquired genetic heterogeneity
that allow tumors to become more resilient and escape Myc dependence rather than mere
differences resulting from the absence of a Myc signature, we set out to investigate evidence
for EMT in the MTB/TOM tumors. Histological analysis of hematoxylin and eosin stained
mouse mammary tumor samples from the MTB/TOM mouse revealed the primary samples
to be predominantly of the microacinar and large blue cell type while the Myc-independent
samples were a mixture of large blue cell, squamous, papillary and spindle cell type that are
often characteristic of EMT. Although not all of the primary samples were examined
histologically, the squamous and EMT-like histology pattern was not observed among the
primary tumor samples we examined (Supplementary Table I and Figure 3A).

Author Manuscript

To further investigate the EMT-like nature of these tumor samples, we first examined
expression of several documented markers of EMT including E-cadherin, vimentin, and
fibronectin from our microarray data (Thiery, 2002). Consistent with the EMT nature of
these Myc-independent tumors, we observed increased expression of vimentin and
fibronectin expression using probes on Affymetrix arrays (Figure 3B). Downregulation of Ecadherin was also observed in a subset of the Myc-independent tumors.
Immunohistochemistry by diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining on selected samples confirmed
the expression of the EMT markers from the microarray analysis and additionally
demononstrated a reduction in cytokeratin 18 (Figure 3C). Collectively, our results thus far
show significant histological and genetic changes in the mouse mammary tumors as they
escape MYC dependence and these changes are indicative of a transition to a more
mesenchymal phenotype.
Activation of Ras, TGFβ and TNFα pathways

Author Manuscript

To further define and elucidate genetic differences between the primary and Mycindependent tumors, we used human signatures of cell signaling pathway. These signatures
represent the activation of a cell signaling pathways in the form of a pattern of gene
expression unique to that circumstance and can be quantitated and assessed in other
biological samples. We previously validated and applied the Myc and Ras pathway
signatures on various mouse datasets (Andrechek et al., 2009; Bild et al., 2006; Huang et al.,
2003). We now extend this analysis for the TGFβ and TNFα pathway signatures using
various mouse data sets (see Supplementary Figure I) and applied the TGFβ, Ras and TNFα
gene signatures to the primary and Myc-independent MTB/TOM tumors. Our analyses
showed the Myc-independent tumors have a higher probability of activation of these

pathways versus the primary tumors (Figure 4A). The numerical values representing
predicted pathway probabilities with the upper and lower limits of the predicted values are
provided in the Supplementary Tables. We additionally confirmed activation of these
pathways by immunohistochemisty staining with antibodies to TNFα and phospho-Smad3
as an indication of TGFβ activation Figure 4B.
An abundance of work has noted an association of TGFβ, TNFα and Ras activation with
EMT-like features. We determined whether there was any correlation between activation of
these pathways. A Pearson correlation test showed a positive correlation between these
pathways that showed to be statistically significant by a two-tailed T-test (Figure 4C).
MYC-independent growth has features of cancer initiating cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

A variety of studies has proposed a role for so-called tumor-initiating cells as a component
of the underlying mechanism of tumor recurrence and the acquisition of drug resistance.
These cells generally display characteristics of EMT, show mammosphere-forming and
higher tumor seeding capabilities, and are identified by expression of cell surface markers
(CD44+/CD24−/low) (Al-Hajj et al., 2003; Creighton et al., 2009; Diehn et al., 2009). These
“tumor-initiating” cells are thought to be resistant to therapy and may therefore contribute to
cancer relapse. Given that the MTB/TOM mouse model studied here recapitulates some
features of tumor recurrence and resistance comparable to human cancers, we sought to
explore the extent to which the recurrent tumors were comparable to “tumor initiating” cells
previously characterized from human breast cancers. For this analysis, we utilized data from
human breast cancers that have been flow-sorted for expression of the CD44+/CD24−/low
cell surface marker (GSE7513) (Al-Hajj et al., 2003). We generated a gene expression
signature and validated this signature on an independent data set (GSE6883; Supplementary
Figure II). We then examined the probability of this CD44+/CD24−/low gene signature in the
primary and Myc-independent mouse mammary tumors. As shown in Figure 5A, tumors
that have escaped MYC dependence had a statistically significant higher probability of
exhibiting the CD44+/CD24−/low gene signature. Additionally, an analysis of our primary
tumors showed a higher probability of the CD44+/CD24−/low gene signature in tumors that
regressed to a nonpalpable state versus tumors that do not regress to a nonpalpable state in
response to initial Myc removal (Figure 5B). Collectively, these results showed MYCindependent growth is generally associated with a higher CD44+/CD24−/low gene signature
probability and suggests that MYC-independent growth may be acquired through
mechanisms reminiscent of how human tumors recur and acquire drug resistance.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

Perhaps the largest challenge facing the effective treatment of cancer, including breast
cancer, is the substantial heterogeneity and complexity that is evident in these disease states.
Breast cancer is not one disease but rather a multitude of disorders with distinct etiologies.
This can be seen in the variation evident in primary tumors that defines response to therapies
as well as differential prognosis. It can also be seen in the recurrence of disease following
initial therapy that most often is then associated with mortality. Elucidating the
heterogeneity that permit tumor cells to escape blockade of a dominant oncogenic pathway,

survive in a latent state and eventually reestablish malignant growth is thus of fundamental
importance to making progress towards the goal of effective treatments and improved
disease outcomes. The ability to use a mouse genetic model as a means to study these
events, particularly the distinctions amongst primary tumors that define response to therapy
and subsequent disease progression, is a key opportunity to better understand the human
disease. We suggest that the observations we describe here, that provide clear evidence for
heterogeneity and complexity within a mouse model reflecting events seen in the human
disease, is one such opportunity.

Author Manuscript

Although the mouse mammary tumors studied here were initiated by a single oncogenic
event, it is nevertheless clear that there is substantial heterogeneity in the primary tumors
that determined the response to Myc withdrawal and the likelihood for progression to the
Myc-independent state. In reality, the withdrawal of Myc expression as enabled in this
model is a mimic for a Myc-specific drug. As such, it is apparent that while some of the
tumors are indeed more reliant on the action of Myc and thus their growth is subdued by the
inhibition of Myc function, others are not. This variation, that determines the outcome of the
‘Myc therapy’, mirrors similar situations in the treatment of human breast cancer where for
instance there is variation in the response to Herceptin within the Her2 positive population
of breast tumors. Although Ras activating mutations might be partly responsible for this
variation, given the previous evidence for the coincidence of these mutations in the MMTV
Myc model, it is apparent that this is perhaps not sufficient to explain the variability in
outcome in a small subset of tumors that do not harbor ras mutations or pathway activity.

Author Manuscript

Prior work by Moody et al has shown an EMT phenotype to be associated with recurrence
of Neu-induced mouse mammary tumors (Moody et al., 2002). In light of these observations
together with our results, we suggest that the acquisition of an EMT phenotype in the mouse
model is not specific to a particular oncogene initiating event but is a general event
associated with more resilient tumors at a later stage of tumor progression. Our work
provides novelty in that we have observed significant gene profile differences including
activation of the TGFβ, TNFα, and RAS signaling pathways associated with an escape from
oncogene dependent growth in the MTB/TOM mouse model. Consistent with this
observation, an abundance of literature has reported the TGFβ, TNFα, and RAS signaling
pathways to have a prometastatic role associated with an EMT phenotype during the later
stages of tumorigenesis. (Acloque et al., 2008; Singh and Settleman, 2010; Thiery, 2002;
Thiery et al., 2009). Our observations reported here suggest the MTB/TOM mouse to be a
good model system for investigating future therapeutic opportunities in targeting a
combination of these signaling pathways in more advanced human cancers.

Author Manuscript

Recent work has connected EMT to the emergence of cancer stem cells (Mani et al., 2008).
Consistent with EMT-like features and the propensity for more aggressive tumor growth, a
higher probability of the CD44+/CD24−/low gene signature was associated with MYCindependent growth. Tumorgenic breast cancer cells that express high levels of CD44 and
low CD24 in humans have been proposed to be resistant to chemotherapy and are thought to
be responsible for cancer relapse (Creighton et al., 2009). We emphasize that although these
results do not suggest that our recurrent tumors are cancer-initiating cells, these observations
do suggest that these tumors share properties of EMT and are indicative of cells that are

more robust and resistant to cell death. Primary samples that did not regress after withdrawal
of MYC expression were more likely to exhibit characteristics of the CD44+/CD24−/low
phenotype. These results suggest CD44+/CD24−/low features may be a good predictor of the
extent to which a tumor has escaped MYC dependence in this mouse model and further
suggests this model to be good system for developing combination therapeutic strategies to
target cells that are resistant to the ablation of one oncogenic pathway. Furthermore, studies
by Creighton et al. have alluded to the similarities between CD44+/CD24−/low and
mammosphere-forming cells to human breast cancers of the “claudin low” type, previously
characterized by Herschkowitz et al (Herschkowitz et al., 2007). These findings highlight
the value of further defining the potential of this MTB/TOM mouse model in studying the
molecular complexity underlying specific groups of human cancers. .

Author Manuscript

Finally, an area of research that is becoming increasingly more intriguing is the mechanisms
underlying the phenomenon of oncogene addiction and how some tumors escape this
addiction. What is evident in the studies we present here is the degree of heterogeneity
acquired in tumors that evolve to thrive independent of expression from the oncogeneinitiating event. The value in this determination is the extent to which the heterogeneity
itself is a model of human disease and thus provides an opportunity for further dissection of
this heterogeneity with the goal of working towards personalized therapeutics in human
cancer.

Statistical Analysis of Pathway Predictions

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The statistical methods for pathway analysis have been thoroughly described but are
reiterated here for clarification (Bild et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2003; West et al., 2001;
Gatza et al.). The following explanation is from Gatza et al. In our pathway analysis, a
signature represents a group of genes that collectively exhibit a consistent pattern of
expression. This signature enables a distinction between two phenotypes. A metagene
representing a group of genes that collectively demonstrate a consistent pattern of
expression for a specific phenotype is identified from the training data (Phenotype A versus
Phenotype B). Each signature summarizes its constituent genes as a single expression profile
and is derived from the first principal component of that gene set. This factor corresponds to
the largest singular value as determined by singular value decomposition (SVD). Bayesian
methods are then used to estimate binary probability regression models based on a given set
of expression vectors (values across metagenes) derived from the training data. Application
of these models to an independent validation dataset enables the evaluation of predictive
probabilities of each of the two phenotypic states for each sample in the validation dataset.
In these analyses, gene selection and identification is based solely on the training data.
Metagene values are computed using the principal components of the training data ensuring
reproducibility of the signature irrespective of the composition of the validation dataset.
Bayesian fitting of binary probability regression models to the training data enable
assessment of the relevance of the metagene signature in within-sample classification as
well as estimation and uncertainty assessment for the binary regression weights. This results
in the mapping of metagenes to probabilities of relative pathway status. Evaluation of
independent tumor or cell line samples results in the prediction of relative pathway status
generating estimated relative probabilities, and associated measures of uncertainty, of
activation or deregulation for each sample in the validation dataset.

Author Manuscript

To ensure that over-fitting does not occur in the generation of each signature, a leave-oneout cross validation was performed for each set of training data to examine the stability and
predictive capabilities of our model. In this analysis, each sample is left out, one at a time, of
the dataset and the model was refitted (both the metagene factors and the partitions used)
using the remaining samples. The software for this analysis can be downloaded from http://

A. Flow diagram describes when tumors were collected in MTB/TOM mice. Genome-scale
expression of the “primary” and “Myc-independent” tumors was assessed on Affymetrix
Mouse 430A.2 arrays. B. Approximately 40% of tumors regressed to a nonpalpable state
while 60% of tumors never reached a nonpalpable state after removal of Myc expression.
Among the 60% of tumors that never reached a nonpalpable state, 37% showed some extent
of regression but quickly resumed growth while 23% showed no signs of regression and
either remained dormant or continued to grow. C. MYC pathway activity in tumor samples
