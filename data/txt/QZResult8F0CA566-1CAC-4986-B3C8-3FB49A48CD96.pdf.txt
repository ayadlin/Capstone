ABSTRACT
HRAS is a frequently mutated oncogene in cancer. However, mutant HRAS
as drug target has not been investigated so far. Here, we show that mutant HRAS
hyperactivates the RAS and the mTOR pathway in various cancer cell lines including
lung, bladder and esophageal cancer. HRAS mutation sensitized toward growth
inhibition by the MEK inhibitors AZD6244, MEK162 and PD0325901. Further, we found
that MEK inhibitors induce apoptosis in mutant HRAS cell lines but not in cell lines
lacking RAS mutations. In addition, knockdown of HRAS by siRNA blocked cell growth
in mutant HRAS cell lines. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway alone or in combination
with MEK inhibitors did not alter signaling nor had an impact on viability. However,
inhibition of mTOR or combined inhibition of MEK and mTOR reduced cell growth in a
synergistic manner. Finally, Ba/F3 cells transformed with mutant HRAS isoforms Q61L,
Q61R and G12V demonstrated equal sensitivity towards MEK and mTOR inhibition.
Our results show that HRAS mutations in cancer activate the RAS and mTOR pathways
which might serve as a therapeutic option for patients with HRAS mutant tumors.

rapid progression and deterioration suggesting that HRAS
mutations in NSCLC tumors might be aggressive and
associated with poor overall prognosis, similar to KRAS
mutant NSCL [6]. Interestingly, one phase I trial for the
novel Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)
inhibitor RO5126766 reported a tumor patient with HRAS
mutation that showed 20% tumor shrinkage due to MEK
inhibitor treatment [7]. This is the first hint that HRAS
mutant cancer patients might benefit clinically from MEK
inhibitor treatment. However, whether HRAS mutations
generally sensitize towards treatment with MEK inhibitors
has not been investigated yet. Further, little is known about
signaling of oncogenic HRAS and putative druggability.
Typical hotspots for HRAS mutations are found at
codon 12, 13 and 61, resulting in G12C/S, G13R/V and
Q61R/L mutations [8]. These positions for mutations
of HRAS are at the very same sides as mutations found
for NRAS [9]. As of today, mutant NRAS has been far
better investigated, mainly in melanoma but also in other
cancers such as lung cancer and T-cell lymphoma. NRAS
mutations are mostly found at codon 61 and to a fewer
extend at codons 12 and 13. NRAS mutations occur at

INTRODUCTION
Harvey-RAS (HRAS) belongs to the RAS family
of small GTPases which activate the RAS–RAF–MEK–
ERK pathway. Mutations in RAS family members lead to
hyperactivity of the RAS signaling pathway. HRAS is a
frequently mutated oncogene especially in head and neck
cancer (3.9%), bladder cancer (5.1%), vulvar squamous
cell carcinoma (9.3%), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
and lung cancer (3.8%) [1–3]. This adds up to a significant
number of patients eligible for putative targeted therapies.
Frequency of HRAS mutations varies. Histological
subtypes could play a role as a report described a high
frequency of HRAS mutations in inverted urothelial
papilloma (IUP) - an uncommon neoplasm of the urinary
bladder with distinct morphologic features [4]. In addition,
HRAS mutations seem to be more frequent in squamous
cell cancer of the lung (2.8%) than in adenocarcinoma of
the lung (1%) [2, 5]. Clinical characteristics and behavior
of HRAS mutant cancer patients have been described
scarcely. One recent report described an adenocarcinoma
of the lung with HRAS Q61L mutation suffering from

about 15% to 25% in melanoma patients [10, 11] and are
known to activate the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathway.
Approaches targeting oncogenic NRAS directly including
farnesylation inhibitors have failed. But inhibiting
downstream MEK kinase by MEK kinase inhibitors
was proven to be successful in melanoma, lung cancer
and T-cell lymphoma cell lines [12–14]. MEK inhibitors
blocked cell growth at clinical relevant concentrations
and even induced apoptosis [12–14]. Mutant NRAS
was also shown to activate the PI3K/mechanistic target
of rapamycin (mTOR)-signaling cascade and combined
inhibition of MEK and PI3K was synergistic in certain
NRAS mutant cell lines of melanoma, lung cancer and
neuroblastoma [14, 15]. More important, the concept of
targeted treatment of NRAS mutant melanoma could be
demonstrated within clinical trials. In a phase II trial 30
patients with NRAS mutant melanoma were treated with
the MEK inhibitor MEK162. 20% of treated patients
showed a partial response and 43% stable disease [16].
These promising results will be further studied in a phase
III clinical trial [17].
In the present study, we investigated HRAS
downstream signaling in five different cancer cell lines
including lung and bladder cancer and putative drugs for
targeted therapy. We observed that lung cancer cell lines
harboring HRAS mutations showed significant higher
sensitivity to MEK inhibitors than HRAS wild-type cell
lines. Further, the effect of MEK inhibitors was enhanced
synergistically by the addition of mTOR but not PI3K
inhibitors. Inhibition of mTOR alone is sufficient to block
cell growth in HRAS mutant but not wild-type cell lines.
To our knowledge, we describe for the first time that
HRAS mutations can be targeted by MEK and mTOR
inhibitors.

clinical development including AZD6244 (Selumetinib)
and MEK162 (Binimetinib) [16, 22]. This prompted us
to ask whether MEK inhibitors could be of relevance
for treatment of HRAS mutated patients. We detected
that HRAS mutant cell lines KNS-62, NCI-H1915, T24,
RL95–2 and KYSE-30 had significantly lower EC50
values for MEK inhibition than HRAS wild-type cells such
as CAL12T, HCC44, HCC827 and HCC78 (Figure 1C,1D,
Supplementary Figure S1A). EC50 value for HRAS wild
type cell lines CAL12T was 2.15 μM and for HCC44,
HCC827 or HCC78 EC50 was above 3 μM (Figure 1C).
In contrast, HRAS mutant cell lines had EC50 values for
AZD6244 ranging from 4–5nM (T24 and RL95–2) over
166–258nM (KNS-62, NCI-H1915) to 437nM (KYSE-30)
(Figure 1C). EC50 values for MEK162 were found
to be in a similar range (Figure 1D). These are clinical
relevant plasma concentrations since maximal plasma
concentrations of AZD6244 and MEK162 are at 1.75
μM and 1.13 μM, respectively [23, 24]. Next, we wanted
to investigate efficacy of MEK inhibitors under serumreduced and hypoxic conditions. Though cell growth
was slightly impaired under serum-reduced conditions
MEK inhibitors efficiently blocked cell growth in HRAS
mutant cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1B). Under
hypoxic conditions with 0.2% oxygen cell growth of
controls was strongly impaired (data not shown) and, thus,
MEK inhibitors were slightly less efficient than under
standard cell culture conditions (Supplementary Figure
S1B). Further, we checked whether inhibition of MEK
blocks signaling of the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathway.
AZD6244, MEK162 and PD0325901 blocked basal ERK
phosphorylation in all HRAS mutant cell lines (Figure 1E).
ERK phosphorylation was not blocked in HRAS wild-type
cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1C). Taken together this
data shows, that HRAS mutation results in hyperactivation
of the RAS pathway in cancer cell lines from various
tissues and that this activation sensitizes towards treatment
with MEK inhibitors.

RESULTS
MEK inhibitors block cell growth in HRAS
mutant cancer cell lines

Mutant HRAS is critical for survival of mutant
HRAS cancer cell lines

In order to study HRAS mutations we collected
HRAS mutant cancer cell lines including KNS-62,
NCI-H1915, T24, RL95–2 and KYSE-30 (Figure 1A).
Sequencing data for primary tumor tissue available
at COSMIC data base revealed that the HRAS Q61L
mutation is the most common in lung cancer of
adenocarcinoma and squamous cell cancer (Figure 1B).
This is reflected by the two lung cancer cell lines KNS-62
(squamous) and NCI-H1915 (adenocarcinoma) which both
harbor a Q61L mutation. The HRAS G12V mutation is
predominant in bladder cancer which was detected in the
T24 bladder cancer cell line (Figure 1B) [19]. HCC827
is a cell line with described EGFR mutation and HCC78
was found to harbor a ROS1 translocation [20, 21]. RAS
kinases are well known to activate the RAS–RAF–MEK–
ERK cascade and several MEK inhibitors are under

Since MEK inhibitors block cell growth we wanted
to analyze whether induction of apoptosis occurs in
HRAS mutant cancer cell lines. We incubated cell lines
with MEK inhibitors and measured apoptosis 72 hours
later. Indeed, MEK inhibitor MEK162 induced apoptosis
in HRAS mutant cell lines KNS-62, NCI-H1915, T24,
RL95–2 and KYSE-30 but not in HRAS wild-type cell
lines (Figure 2A, 2B). Apoptosis measured ranged between
18% and 60% for HRAS mutant cell lines (Figure 2C).
To further study the role of HRAS, we performed a
specific HRAS knockdown by 2 different siRNAs. HRAS
siRNA reduced protein expression of HRAS which
subsequently resulted in significantly reduced cell growth
of HRAS mutant cell lines compared to wild-type cell

cell lines are addicted to continuous HRAS activity which
is required for survival.

early clinical trials [26]. AKT8055 blocked downstream
phosphorylation of S6 kinase alone (Figure 4B). Yet,
phosphorylation of S6 kinase was further blocked if
AKT8055 was used in combination with MEK inhibitors
(Figure 4B). Combination of AKT8055 and MEK
inhibitors also blocked cell growth synergistically in
mutant HRAS cell lines according to Chou-Talalay
(Figure 4D; Supplementary Figure S2C). To summarize,
these data show that combination of mTOR and MEK
inhibitors synergistically inhibit downstream signaling and
cell growth of HRAS mutant cell lines.

Combined inhibition of MEK and mTOR
synergistically reduces cell growth in HRAS
mutant tumor cells
Previously, it was demonstrated that mutant NRAS
melanoma cells are sensitive to the combination of MEK
and PI3K inhibitors [14]. We found that the NCI-H1915
cell line had no detectable phosphorylation levels of
AKT Ser 473 despite strong expression of basal AKT
(Figure 3A). Further, pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 did
not alter phosphorylation of AKT Ser 473 in KNS-62 cell
line (Figure 3A). These findings are in line with a lack
of growth inhibition for single pan-PI3K inhibition or
combined treatment with MEK162 in HRAS mutant cell
lines (Figure 3B). These results were further supported
by studies with a second PI3K kinase inhibitor BYL719
which had no effect on cell growth (data not shown).
We conclude that inhibition of the PI3K pathway is not
relevant for survival and cell growth of HRAS mutant
cancer cells.
Enhanced apoptosis and tumor growth suppression
by combination of MEK and mTOR inhibitors was
previously observed in HRAS wild-type lung cancer
cell lines [25]. Therefore, we asked the question whether
inhibition of the down-stream mTOR complex could
be an effective target for mutant HRAS. The clinically
available mTOR inhibitor Everolimus blocked activity of
S6, a kinase downstream of mTOR, in HRAS mutant cell
lines (Figure 4A). This inhibition of the mTOR pathway
translated in blockage of cell growth preferentially in
HRAS mutant cancer cell lines (Figure 4A). Encouraged
by these results, we aimed to investigate the combination
of mTOR inhibitor Everolimus and MEK inhibitors. If
used together, combination of Everolimus and AZD6244/
MEK162 caused a stronger inhibition of S6 kinase than
single use of Everolimus on Western blot (Figure 4B;
Supplementary Figure S2A). The combination of
Everolimus and AZD6244 / MEK162 also translated in
a stronger blockade of cell growth in HRAS mutant cells
than single use (Figure 4C; Supplementary Figure S2B).
Of note, concentrations used for combined inhibition
are at very low nanomolar concentrations for both
Everolimus and AZD6244 or MEK162 (Figure 4C;
Supplementary Figure S2B). More important, the
combination of Everolimus and MEK inhibitors was
found to be synergistic according to method of ChouTalalay [18]. Synergism is defined by a combination
index (CI) inferior 1 [18]. MEK162 showed stronger
synergism with Everolimus than AZD6244 (Figure 4C).
To further support the synergistic action of mTOR and
MEK inhibitors in HRAS mutant cells we used the
novel mTOR1/2 inhibitor AKT8055 which entered

Mutant HRAS-driven transformation of Ba/F3
cells is sensitive to MEK inhibitors
We wanted to study the functional consequences of
the different HRAS mutations including Q61L, Q61R and
G12V in more detail by testing their abilities to transform
interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent murine lymphoid Ba/
F3 cells to cytokine-independent growth. Removal of
IL-3 lead to a clear difference in cell proliferation. Ba/
F3 cells expressing ectopic HRAS Q61L, Q61R or
G12V mutations showed strong cell growth whereas
Ba/F3 cells with wild-type HRAS or empty vector
stopped cell growth (Supplementary Figure S3A). Ba/
F3 cells expressing mutant versions of HRAS exhibited
constitutive phosphorylation of ERK and S6 which was
blocked by MEK162 or Everolimus, respectively (Figure
5A, 5B). All mutant HRAS forms including Q61L, Q61R
and G12V sensitized equally towards MEK inhibitor or
mTOR inhibitor treatment compared to control vector
cell line kept under IL-3 (Figure 5C, 5D). The calculated
EC50 values of transformed Ba/F3 cells were at low
nanomolar range as observed for mutant cell lines. Since
combined treatment of MEK and mTOR inhibitor resulted
in stronger suppression of S6 phosphorylation than
treatment with single inhibitors (Figure 5B), we wanted
to check combined treatment on cell growth. In both
HRAS mutants, Q61L and G12V, combination of MEK
and mTOR inhibition caused a synergistic blockade of cell
growth (Figure 5E, 5F). To conclude, these data clearly
show that the different HRAS mutations at Q61 and G12
confer equal sensitivity towards inhibition of downstream
MEK and mTOR pathway (Figure 5G).

Combined inhibition of MEK and mTOR
synergistically blocks tumor growth in-vivo
Next, we wanted to evaluate efficacy of MEK and
mTOR inhibitors in a murine xenograft model. We tested
several cell lines and found the human lung cancer cell line
KNS-62 most suitable for xenotransplantation. Treatment
of animals with oral AZD6244 or Everolimus resulted in a
significant reduction in tumor growth in-vivo (Figure 6A).
In addition, combination of AZD6244 and Everolimus
even further reduced tumor growth in-vivo (Figure 6A).
42187

Oncotarget

Of note, combination treatment was significantly more
effective than single treatment for both agents (Figure 6A).
These results were supported by determination of tumor
weight at the end of the xenotransplantation. Again,
tumor weight was significantly reduced in AZD6244 and

Everolimus treated animals (Figure 6B) and tumor weight
was significantly lower in the combination treatment arm
(Figure 6B). We conclude that single and combination
treatment of AZD6244 and Everolimus block tumor
growth in-vivo.

DISCUSSION

in tumor cell lines [12, 13, 15]. Inhibition of MEK in
NRAS mutant melanoma was also successful in a phase
II trial and a large phase III trial is planned [16, 17]. In
this study we were able to show for the first time that
HRAS mutant cancer cell lines can be targeted by MEK
kinase inhibition (Figure 1). Interestingly, the effect
of susceptibility towards MEK inhibition could be
observed for different background of cancer types. HRAS
mutation conferred MEK sensitivity in lung cancer of
adenocarcinoma and squamous origin, bladder cancer,
endometrium cancer and squamous esophageal cancer cell
lines (Figure 1). This is in accordance with mutations of

Lung adenocarcinomas have mutually exclusive
mutations in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and RAS
pathway oncogenes such as EGFR and KRAS [1]. Further
oncogenic mutations can be found in HRAS, NRAS,
BRAF, ERBB2, MET, MAP2K1 and RIT1 [1, 27].
Targeting ‘driver’ mutations including EGFR in lung
cancer and BRAF in melanoma resulted in great clinical
success [28, 29]. Whereas targeting mutant KRAS
remained difficult, several studies demonstrated that
NRAS mutations can be targeted by inhibition of MEK

NRAS that sensitize towards MEK inhibitors in different
kind of tissues including lung cancer, neuroblastoma,
melanoma and T-cell lymphoma [12, 13, 15]. HRAS and
NRAS seem to share signaling similarities which cause
also similar sensitivity towards targeted treatment. Both,
HRAS and NRAS mutations activate the RAS and the
mTOR pathway and induce sensitivity towards MEK
inhibitors. All HRAS mutations studied here are at typical
known sites for activating mutations including G12V and
Q61L. We found that HRAS mutations at position G12
or Q61 rendered transformed Ba/F3 equally sensitive
to MEK inhibitors indicating that all activing mutations
at position G12 and Q61 might be eligible for targeted
treatment patients with HRAS mutant tumors (Figure 1, 4).
Other mutations outside this hotspots at position 12, 13
and 61 do occur but are rare (Figure 1, (COSMIC, 2015)).
It is not clear whether HRAS mutations outside these
hotspots are non-functional passenger mutations or rare
activating mutations which have been identified e.g. for
N- and KRAS in leukemia [30]. HRAS mutations are
frequent with about 2.8 – 5.1% in lung and bladder cancer,
however, rather infrequent in endometrium and esophageal
cancer with about 1% each [31]. Yet our data indicates
that, though rare, patients with HRAS mutated tumors
of different tumor histology might benefit from targeted
therapy. This was further promoted by experiments
in which MEK inhibitors do not only cause growth
inhibition but also induced apoptosis in HRAS mutant
cancer cells (Figure 2). Targeting oncogenic HRAS by
specific kinase inhibitors might be also relevant for tumors
associated with so-called RASophathies. HRAS as protooncogene was associated with Costollo syndrome – a
congenital disorder characterized by coarse face, loose
skin, cardiomyopathy and predisposition to tumors such
as benign papillomas or malign rhabdomyosarcomas,
neuroblastoma and bladder cancer [32]. Patients, but not
parents, showed mutations of HRAS at position glycine 12
and 13 [32]. However, targeting HRAS might be limited
by development of resistance as seen for BRAF inhibitors
in melanoma [33, 34].
To overcome possible resistance mechanisms
and to expand the list of possible drugs we investigated
combinations of PI3K or mTOR inhibitors with MEK
inhibitors. For NRAS mutant cancers the combination
of MEK and the dual PI3K/mTOR were described to
be synergistic [14, 35, 36]. However, we found that
inhibition of PI3K with the inhibitor BKM120 alone or in
combination did not block cell growth or further enhanced
it (Figure 3). The PI3K inhibitor BYL719 did not work
synergistically either (data not shown). Our observations
are supported by recent clinical data. The combination of
BKM120 with MEK inhibitor Trametinib failed to achieve
a reasonable response in RAS- or BRAF-mutant lung
cancer patients in a phase Ib trial [37]. We speculated if
mutant HRAS might signal to the mTOR complex directly
without involving PI3K/AKT. This is reflected by our
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

observations showing that the mTOR inhibitor Everolimus
alone was sufficient to block cell growth in HRAS
mutant cells compared to wild-type cell lines (Figure
4, 5). However, HRAS mutations seem to be a better
predictive marker for MEK sensitivity compared to mTOR
sensitivity. The effect of mTOR inhibitors on HRAS
mutant cells was altogether less pronounced compared
to MEK inhibitors. The effect of mTOR inhibitors was
also minor compared to MEK inhibitors in NRAS mutant
melanoma cells [14]. Yet, the combination of both drugs
was synergistic and this synergism occurred at very
low nanomolar concentrations which are also relevant
for clinical treatment and might be associated with less
toxicity (Figure 4, 5). Since most kinase inhibitors are in
early clinical development, only some studies investigated
combination thereof. One recent report demonstrated
that the combination of AZD6244 and the AKT inhibitor
MK2206 is tolerable in a phase I trial [38].
HRAS mutation status was barely tested within
clinical trials. Early clinical trials investigating Everolimus
in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showed partial
responses (PR) for some patients, however, mutation
status was not determined [39, 40]. A very recent trial
testing AZD6244 in a KRAS/NRAS/HRAS mutant cohort
reported one PR out of 10 patients included; however, the
mutation status of these 10 specific patients treated with
AZD6244 was not indicated [41].
We have shown that mutant HRAS is a potential
drug target in different types of cancer including lung
cancer and bladder cancer. HRAS mutations sensitize to
single treatment with MEK and mTOR inhibitors which
can be further enhanced by combinations of MEK and
mTOR inhibitors. Thus, our data may encourage clinical
studies on HRAS mutant cancer patients.

10% fetal calf serum and 1 mM L-glutamine. Lung cancer
cell lines HCC44 and HCC78 cells were cultured in RPMI
medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1
mM L-glutamine. Lung cancer cell line HCC827 cells
were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 20%
fetal calf serum and 1 mM L-glutamine. Ba/F3 cells were
maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS
and 0.5 ng/ml murine IL-3 (Sigma-Aldrich). For serum
reduced experiments cell lines were kept in Accell serum
free media (Dharmacon) supplemented with 1% FCS. For
hypoxia studies cells were kept for 96 h in a 0.2% hypoxia
chamber Invivo2 400 (Ruskinn).

(GE Healthcare) which was blocked with 5% bovine
serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween
(0.05% Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline). The
following antibodies were used: anti-phospho-ERK
(P-p44/p42 (Tyr202/204, #9101, Cell Signaling
Technology), anti-ERK (p44/p42, # 4695, Cell Signaling
Technology), anti-phospho Akt (Ser473, # 4085, Cell

#9128, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-MEK (# 8727,
Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho mTOR
(Ser2448, #2971, Cell Signaling Technology),anti-mTOR
(# 2972, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-HRAS rabbit (#
ab97488, Abcam) and anti–actin (Sigma-Aldrich).

PCR and sequencing of cell lines
Isolation of cellular RNA was done by using the
Qiagen RNA Purification Kit (Qiagen). RNA (1 μg) was
reverse transcribed into cDNA with a reverse transcriptionPCR kit (Applied Biosystems). Next, 5 μL of cDNA was
taken for a PCR of 50 μL volume. We used the following
primers: HRAS forward, 5_-ggggcaggagaccctgtag-3_;
HRAS reverse. PCR was performed, and 30 μL of
PCR product was sent for sequencing to Microsynth,
Switzerland. For sequencing, we used the same primers as
for the PCR. Mutations can be found in Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia (Encyclopedia, 2015).

siRNA transfection and knockdown
KNS-62, NCI-H1915, T24, RL95–2, KYSE-30,
CAL12T, HCC44, HCC827, and HCC78 were transfected
with either control or two different siRNAs against HRAS.
Accell siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon and used
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, siRNAs
were diluted in Accell siRNA Delivery Media from
Dharmacon to a final concentration of 1uM. Knock-down
efficiency was observed after 96 h.

Apoptosis assays
Cell lines were treated with indicated concentrations
of inhibitors and apoptosis was measured after 48 h
and 72 h. Apoptosis was assessed by AnnexinV–APC
(Enzo Lifescience) and propidium iodide (PI) (SigmaAldrich) by FACS. Both reagents were diluted to a final
concentration of 1.5%. Specific cell death was calculated
by the following equation: specific cell death % = (%
experimental cell death - % spontaneous cell death)/(100%
- % spontaneous cell death) x 100 (Jin et al., 2006).

Ba/F3 assays
Ba/F3 cells were transduced retrovirally with empty
pMSCV-Puro (kindly provided by Dr. Balabanov) or
pMSCV-Puro expression wild-type HRAS, HRAS Q61L,
HRAS Q61R, HRAS G12V with the help of 293T Phoenix
cells (ATCC). Synthesis of HRAS or HRAS mutants,
cloning and DNA sequencing of cloned inserts was
performed by LifeTechnologies. Transduced cells were
seeded at concentrations below 1 × 106/ml, selected with
puromycin at 1 μg/ml (in addition with 0.1 ng/ml IL-3)
3d after transduction. Section pressure was maintained
for at least 1 week, then IL-3 was reduced under ongoing
puromycin treatment. IL-3 independent clones grew out
after 5–7 days and were kept under puromycin 1 μg/ml.

Cell proliferation and viability assays
Cell proliferation was determined by Cell-TiterGlo Reagent (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a
density of 500 - 2500 cells per well. The next day,
drugs were added at indicated concentrations and cell
proliferation was measured 4 days later. Measurement of
proliferation was done using a 96-well plate luminometer/
plate reader (Synergy 2, Biotek). Data were calculated
as relative values: luminescence for a given drug
concentration was compared to luminescence of untreated
cells. All experimental points were set up in duplicate
replicates and were conducted at least 3 independent
times. IC50 were calculated with GraphPad Prims.
Combination index (CI) values with CalcuSyn Software

Western blot analysis
A total of 0.5 × 106 cells were lysed for 30 minutes
in ice-cold MPERM buffer supplemented with 25 mM
NaF, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and complete protease inhibitor
cocktail from Roche Diagnostics. Cell debris was
removed by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 minutes,
loading buffer added and treated for 5 min at 95°C. Then,
proteins were separated by gel electrophoresis. Separated
proteins were blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane

Mouse xenotransplantation
We tested lung cancer cell line KNS-62 and bladder
cancer cell line T24 for engraftment rates by subcutaneous
injection in CB17 SCID-/- mice. Engraftment and growth
rate was excellent for KNS-62 already after 6 days but
poor for T24 cells (tumors shrinked after 14d). Finally,
we xenotransplanted 1*106 KNS-62 cells into CB17
SCID-/- mice. Engrafted tumors reached 150 mm3 after 6
days and animals were randomized into 4 groups: DMSO
only (n = 5), AZD6244 (Selumetinib) at 20mg/kg (n = 5),
Everolimus at 3.5mg/kg (n = 5), and combined AZD6244
and Everolimus at 20mg/kg and 3.5mg/kg respectively
(n = 5). Inhibitors were kept at stock concentrations of
250 mM (AZD6244) and 10 mM (Everolimus), diluted in
1000ul DMSO each and carefully diluted in animal water.
Concentrations were adjusted to 4ml drink volume per day
which was the observed volume for previous experiments.
Tumor size and weight was monitored three times
weekly, and the mouse technician who was measuring
tumor size was blinded to grouping until the trial was
completed. Determination of tumor volume was done by
3 dimensional digital caliper measurements. Statistical
analysis of the experiment was done by a two-tailed t
test at each time point. P-values < 0.05 (*), or p-values
< 0.01 (**) were considered significant between different
treatment groups. The animal study was performed in
accordance with the University Zurich Animal Committee
and animals were euthanized as soon as tumor volume
exceeded 3000 mm3 or necrosis of tumors.
