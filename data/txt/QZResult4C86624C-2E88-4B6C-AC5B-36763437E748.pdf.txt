ABSTRACT
Deregulated mRNA translation has been implicated in disease development and in
part is controlled by a eukaryotic initiation complex eIF4F (composed of eIF4E, eIF4G
and eIF4A). We demonstrate here that the cap bound fraction from lymphoma cells
was enriched with eIF4G and eIF4E indicating that lymphoma cells exist in an activated
translational state. Moreover, 77% (110/142) of diffuse large B cell lymphoma tumors
expressed eIF4E and this was associated with an inferior event free survival. Overexpression of wild-type eIF4E (eIF4EWT) but not cap-mutant eIF4E (eIF4Ecap mutant)
increased the activation of the eIF4F complex. Treatment with the active -site dual
mTOR inhibitor CC214-1 reduced the level of the eIF4F complex by decreasing the
cap bound fraction of eIF4G and increasing the levels of 4E-BP1. CC214-1 inhibited
both the cap dependent and global protein translation. CC214-1 inhibited c-Myc,
and cyclin D3 translation by decreasing polysomal fractions from lymphoma cells.
Inhibition of eIF4E with shRNA further decreased the CC214-1 induced inhibition of
the eIF4F complex, c-Myc, cyclin D3 translation, and colony formation. These studies
demonstrate that the eIF4F complex is deregulated in aggressive lymphoma and that
dual mTOR therapy has therapeutic potential in these patients.

of cap-dependent translation in eukaryotes. The eIF4F
complex contains a translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E),
a scaffolding protein eIF4G, and the RNA helicase eIF4A.
eIF4E is the cap-binding factor and its overexpression in
solid tumor cells is associated with higher rates of cancer
recurrence and cancer-related death.[4, 5] Various studies
have demonstrated the overexpression of eIF4E in solid
malignancies including esophageal cancer [6] and breast
cancer;[7] however, there are currently no available FDAapproved anti-cancer agents that directly target eIF4E.
eIF4E is controlled by 4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs)
that are one of the important downstream targets of the
mTOR pathway.[8] Hyper-phosphorylated 4E-BPs bind
weakly to eIF4E allowing eIF4E to bind with eIF4G

INTRODUCTION
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the 7th most
common cause of cancer in the USA with diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) being the most common
type in the US.[1] With standard RCHOP therapy
approximately 60% of patients are cured; however, 40%
of patients relapse and die of disease. New treatments are
needed that target the specific signal pathways that are
activated in lymphoma cells to enhance the initial response
and prevent relapse. Recent reviews have described the
potential importance of therapies that target protein
translation.[2, 3] The translation of mRNA to protein
is controlled by the eIF4F complex, a critical regulator

Effect of eIF4E depletion or overexpression
on the eIF4F complex, cell growth and global
protein translation

and activate mRNA translation. It has been previously
demonstrated that targeting 4E-BP1 phosphorylation
using inhibitors of mTORC1 such as rapamycin analogues
results in important but modest clinical responses.[9, 10]
In vitro studies have attributed this partial and transient
response to rapalogs to additional changes that occur,
including high expression of mTORC2 and subsequent
Akt and eIF4E phosphorylation.[11] To improve on the
clinical results with single-agent mTORC1 inhibitors,
combination therapies and dual mTOR inhibitors that
target both mTORC1 and mTORC2 have been developed.
These types of inhibitors compete with ATP in the
catalytic site of mTOR, inhibiting the function of both
mTORC1 and mTORC2 and blocking the feedback Akt
and eIF4E activation.[12] We recently demonstrated that
the cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects of dual mTOR
inhibition were more effective than rapamycin at inhibiting
malignant cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis.[13]
The present study was designed to comprehensively
evaluate the role of the eIF4F complex in aggressive
lymphoma cell growth and learn if dual mTOR inhibitor
could inhibit eIF4F complex mediated mRNA translation.

To further explore if the alterations in eIF4E
availability determine the integrity of the eIF4F complex,
we depleted eIF4E through shRNA and performed a cap
affinity assay to assess the effect on the eIF4F complex.
HEK293eIF4E/shRNA and HEK293con shRNA stable cells were
immunoprecipitated with m7GTP beads and immunoblotted
with eIF4G, 4E-BP1 and eIF4E antibodies. eIF4E inhibition
reduced the association of eIF4G and 4E-BP1 without
affecting whole cell lysate (10% input) (Figure 1B).
On the other hand, ectopic expression of eIF4E
increased the binding of eIF4G and 4E-BP1 to cap in wild
type (HEK293eIF4E/WT), but not in cap mutant (HEK293cap mutant)
cells (Figure 1C). Surprisingly, wild type-eIF4E (eIF4E WT)
was not able to increase the global protein translation (Data
not shown). Colony formation in HEK293eIF4E/shRNA was
significantly reduced and a 70% reduction was observed in
the eIF4E-depleted cells (Figure 1D).

Mechanism of overactivation of translation
initiation complex eIF4F complex

RESULTS

Formation of the cap dependent translation
complex is dependent upon several factors such as
availability of eIF4E due to PI3K/mTOR pathway
activation, hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1, and eIF4E
hyperphosphorylation. We sought to determine which
factor(s) is responsible for the activated eIF4F complex in
aggressive lymphoma.
We first examined whether there was evidence for
eIF4E expression in untreated DLBCL tumor samples using
a DLBCL TMA for IHC. The expression of eIF4E was
assessed semi-quantitatively as follows; negative (< 10% of
cells eIF4E positive) or positive (>10% tumor cells eIF4E
positive). Overall, 77% (110/142) patient samples were eIF4E
positive (Figure 2A). The eIF4E expression frequencies
were similar for germinal center B (GCB) and activated B
cell (ABC) tumors (Figure 2A). eIF4E overexpression was
significantly associated with stages III and IV of Ann Arbor
staging system (Table 1) and with an inferior EFS (p-value =
0.12) (Figure 2B). eIF4E expression predicted inferior EFS
both in patients with GCB (p-value = 0.16) (Figure 2C) or
ABC (p-value = 0.22) tumor subtypes (Figure 2D).
Phosphorylated 4E-BP1 dissociates from eIF4E and
contributes to the deregulation of eIF4F complex. Next,
we assessed the constitutive phosphorylation status of p4EBP1Thr37/46, p4E-BP1Thr70 and p4E-BP1ser65 in normal B cells
compared to MCL (Jeko, Mino, Granta and JVM2) cell lines.
All four MCL cell lines over-expressed hyper-phosphorylated
4E-BP1 at all the 3 sites; however, normal B cells have hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 (Supplemental Figure 2). Overall,
these data suggest that high levels of eIF4E along with hyperphosphorylated 4E-BP1 exist in the lymphoma cells and
contribute in the formation of active eIF4F complex.

Integrity of the translation initiation complex
eIF4F in lymphoma cells
We assessed the formation of the active eIF4F
(m7GTP-eIF4E-eIF4G) translation initiation complex by
a pull down assay using an agarose-immobilized m7GTP
cap analog to capture eIF4E and its binding partners eIF4G
and eIF4A in MCL cell line cells. The relative amount of
captured eIF4G or eIF4A serves as an indicator of the
integrity of the eIF4F translation complex. Cell lysates
from Jeko, Mino, Granta, JVM2 and CD19+ normal
B cells were incubated with m7GTP and analyzed by
immunoblotting for the level of eIF4A and eIF4G. Our data
demonstrate that the cap-bound fraction from normal B
cells contained very little eIF4G and eIF4A. However, all
the MCL cell lysates were enriched with eIF4G, eIF4E and
eIF4A (Figure 1A). In order to determine the association
of eIF4E with eIF4G, we repeated this experiment by
pulling down eIF4G from the cell lysates of MCL cell
lines and demonstrated that the immunoprecipitates of
eIF4G fraction in MCL cell lysates were indeed enriched
compared to normal B cells and IgG control (Supplemental
Figure 1A). A pull down assay using eIF4E antibody
demonstrated that immunoprecipitates of the eIF4E
fraction were enriched in malignant B cells, suggesting
reciprocal binding between eIF4G and eIF4E in MCL cells
(Supplemental Figure 1B). Overall, these data demonstrate
that the cap bound fraction from lymphoma cells was
enriched with eIF4G, eIF4E and eIF4A, demonstrating
that aggressive lymphoma B cells exist in a translationally
activated state.

CC214-1 blocks the eIF4F complex and cap
dependent protein translation

downstream of mTOR. We performed a cap affinity
assay in Jeko and Mino MCL cells treated with CC214-1.
CC214-1 caused a dose dependent inhibition in the
association of eIF4G and eIF4A with eIF4E in both Jeko
and Mino cells without much effect on the global quantity
of these proteins (Figure 3A). Further evidence that
CC214-1 was inhibiting the eIF4F complex formation
was the increase in eIF4E bound 4E-BP1 after CC214-1

Since there is currently no drug that can directly
inhibit the deregulated eIF4F complex in cancer cells,
we assessed the effect of the next generation dual mTOR
inhibitor CC214-1 on the translation initiation complex

treatment of Jeko and Mino cells. Total levels of 4E-BP1
in the 10% input of CC214-1 treated immunoprecipitates
were decreased (Figure 3A). Rapamycin, an mTORC1
inhibitor failed to alter the binding of eIF4G and 4E-BP1
to cap in Mino cells (Supplemental Figure 3A). We, then,
evaluated the consequences of CC214-1 treatment on the
4E-BP1 phosphorylation in MCL cell lines. We observed a
dose dependent decrease in the hyper-phosphorylated form
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of 4E-BP1 in response to CC214-1 but not with mTORC1
inhibitor at the given concentration. This effect was observed
in multiple 4E-BP1 phosphorylation sites including
4E-BP1 at serine 65 in Jeko cells (Supplemental Figure 3B).
However, both CC214-1 and mTORC1 inhibitor inhibited
the S6 ribosomal protein phosphorylation. CC214-1
inhibited global protein translation in both Jeko and Mino
cells (Supplemental Figure 4).

Effect of CC214-1 on the cap-dependent translation
was examined using bicistronic plasmids. In this plasmid,
renilla luciferase gene represents cap-dependent protein
translation, and firefly luciferase gene control capindependent translation (pRF). CC214-1 inhibited the capdependent translation in a dose dependent manner with
limited effect on the cap-independent translation as shown
by luciferase assay (Figure 3B).
The effect of CC214-1 on lymphoma cell survival was
first evaluated in MCL cell lines such as Mino, Jeko, JVM2
and Granta. CC214-1 treatment produced a dose dependent
inhibition of survival in all the 4 MCL cell lines tested
(Figure 3C). In order to overcome any differences regarding
microenvironment and growth rate between MCL cell
lines and patient samples, we treated malignant cells from
4 different MCL patients with CC214-1 in-vitro. Similar to
the cell lines, CC214-1 treatment caused inhibition of patient
tumor cell survival (Figure 3D).

suggesting polysome inhibition (Figure 5A) in Jeko
and Mino cells.
Polysomal mRNA levels of c-Myc, Mcl-1 and
cyclin D3 were assessed in response to CC214-1 in the
pooled monosomal and polysomal fractions. Indeed, in
cells treated with CC214-1 there was a reduction of c-Myc
(Figure 5B), cyclin D3 (Figure 5C) and Mcl-1 (Figure 5D)
mRNAs only in the polysomal fractions in MCL cells.
These data suggest that the dual mTOR inhibitor CC2141 interferes with translation process by inhibiting the
function of actively translating ribosomes.

Effect of increased or decreased eIF4E
availability on CC214-1 mediated effect on eIF4F
complex
eIF4E levels have been found to be elevated in
several types of cancer.[15–18] To elucidate the role of
eIF4E availability in the response to CC214-1 on eIF4F
complex, eIF4E was knocked down and then the cells
were treated with CC214-1. CC214-1 was able to inhibit
the binding of eIF4E and eIF4G to cap in both eIF4E
shRNA as well as in the control shRNA cells; however,
inhibition was slightly more in the eIF4E depleted cells
(Figure 6A, left panel). Next, we sought to determine the
CC214-1 effect on eIF4F complex integrity while eIF4E is
overexpressed. Wild type eIF4E was transiently expressed
and assays for cap affinity, proliferation, and apoptosis
were performed. CC214-1 suppressed the binding of
eIF4G to cap in HEK293cap mutant and HEK293PCDNA3.1 cells.
CC214-1 was able to inhibit binding of eIF4G to cap in
cells over-expressing wild type-eIF4E but the binding
was less inhibited as compared to HEK293PCDNA3.1 and
HEK293cap mutant (Figure 6A, right panel).
Furthermore, the assay revealed a 72% inhibition in
the cell proliferation in the plasmid alone cells as compared
to untreated cells. However only 39% inhibition was
observed in the proliferation in the eIF4E overexpressing
cells as compared to untreated cells (Figure 6B, panel left).
To further confirm the effect of high eIF4E availability on
cell survival after treatment with CC214-1, flow cytometry
was performed. HEK293PCDNA3.1 cells showed 26%
reduction of survival in plasmid alone cells as compared
to the untreated control, however eIF4E overexpressing
cells showed only 7% inhibition in survival as compared
to the untreated control (Figure 6B, panel right).
In eIF4E-shRNA cells, treatment with CC214-1 was
able to significantly inhibit colony formation (70%) as
compared to control shRNA cells (50%) (Figure 6C). To
evaluate the effect of c-Myc deregulation in dual mTOR
inhibition, we treated cells with either c-Myc or control
siRNA for 48 hours and proliferation was performed.
Silencing the expression of c-Myc resulted in decreased
proliferation. Moreover treatment with CC214-1 inhibited
cell proliferation 56% in plasmid alone cells as compared to
the untreated cells, whereas 83% suppression of proliferation

Effect of CC214-1 on translation of eIF4E
targets
Long, highly structured 5′-UTRs are typical of
proto-oncogene mRNAs such as c-Myc, Mcl-1 and
Cyclin D3 and considered eIF4E sensitive.[3, 14] To
evaluate the effects of treatment with CC214-1 on the
transcription of eIF4E known targets, we performed
qualitative RT-PCR using specific primers for cyclin
D3, Mcl-1 and c-Myc. CC214-1 did not inhibit the
transcription of cyclin D3, Mcl-1 and c-Myc mRNA in
Jeko and Granta cells (Figure 4A). However, CC214-1
was able to suppress c-Myc and cyclin D3 protein level
in a dose dependent manner. Suppression of Mcl-1 was
detectable only after treatment with higher concentrations
of CC214-1 (Figure 4B).
Next, we assessed the effect of the inhibition of
eIF4E on the response to CC214-1 on c-Myc, Mcl-1
and cyclin D3 protein level. Our data demonstrate that
eIF4E inhibition increased the sensitivity of CC214-1 to
inhibit c-Myc, Mcl-1 and cyclin D3 protein levels at 2
μM concentration. (Figure 4C). Moreover, 4 μM CC214-1
still affected sensitivity of Mcl-1 and Cyclin D3 to eIF4E
inhibition; however, we have not observed the same
response in c-Myc protein (Figure 4C).

transcript. Polysome profiling was carried out in Jeko
and Mino cells as described in the Methods section.
We investigated the mechanism of the translation

gradient centrifugation. CC214-1 caused a decrease

only in modest antiproliferative effect in aggressive
lymphoma cells. In the same study, this was attributed
to resistance due to high expression of mTORC2
and subsequent Akt and eIF4E phosphorylation.[11]
Furthermore, Gupta et al have recently provided the
first demonstration of antiproliferative and proapoptotic
properties of a dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor in
lymphoma through Akt pathway inhibition.[13] In the
studies reported herein, we sought to understand the
effect of CC214-1, a next-generation mTORC1/mTORC2
inhibitor on translation pathway associated with eIF4E.
We have also investigated the benefits of a potential use
of the drug in patients. Dual mTOR inhibition targets
cap-dependent translation by decreasing the association
between eIF4F assembly and cap, induces apoptosis,
and inhibits protein expression of c-Myc and cyclin D3
without much effect on their mRNA expression.
Since transcription was unaffected, a polysome
analysis in lymphoma cell lines was carried out in
order to explore the mechanism through which this dual
mTOR inhibitor suppresses translation. Our data show
that CC214-1 treatment causes suppression of mRNA
polysome levels without much effect in monosomal
mRNA. In addition, CC214-1 inhibits c-Myc, Mcl-1, and
cyclin D3 translation through suppression of the highly
translationally active polysomes. These data indicate that
CC214-1 acts through inhibition of translation initiation
whereas joining of the ribosomes to the pre-initiation
complex is unaffected. Of note, we have also observed
that in some occasions treatment with high concentration
of drug might decrease total mRNA in monosomes.
Although our results indicate that CC214-1 acts mainly
by inhibiting cap-dependent translation, the latter finding
could be attributed to several factors, as post-treatment cell
viability was more than 90% in all cases. Wall et al[32]
have recently reported decreased, rapamycin induced,
translation of c-Myc in promyelocytes through inhibition
of translation initiation. Decreased translational efficiency
of Mcl-1 mRNA after rapamycin treatment has also been
shown before.[33]
In summary, this study presents information
regarding alterations in the translation control providing,
in parallel, a mechanistic basis of targeting cap-dependent
translation through next generation mTORC1/mTORC2
inhibitors. The presence of eIF4E expression by IHC
should be further evaluated in trials of dual mTOR
inhibitors to learn whether the expression predicts
response to these agents in lymphoma patients.

DISCUSSION
The eIF4F complex, an important downstream
target of the mTOR pathway, plays a critical role in
the regulation of cap-dependent translation. Herein we
show that the active translation initiation eIF4F complex
(eIF4E-eIF4G-eIF4A) bound to cap is deregulated in
aggressive lymphoma cells whereas expression of active
eIF4F assembly in normal B cells is low. In the present
study we demonstrated that 76% of tumors from newly
diagnosed DLBCL patients (n = 150) express eIF4E by
IHC and that this expression predicts shorter EFS. These
results are consistent with other studies in solid tumors
that demonstrated inferior patient outcome when the tumor
cells overexpressed eIF4E.[19] The positive expression of
4E-BP1[20] and eIF4E[17] in MCL and DLBCL tumors by
IHC has previously been reported but without relationship
to patient outcome. We have previously demonstrated in
a separate cohort of relapsed MCL patients that the 30%
(9/30) of patients with p4E-BP1+ tumors had a shorter
progression-free survival when treated with the mTORC1
inhibitor temsirolimus and rituximab.[21]
In order to address the question whether eIF4E
availability is necessary for the formation of m7GTPeIF4E-eIF4G complex we performed cap-affinity assays
in transfected cells. Based on our results, the level of
eIF4E is critical for the formation of the translation
initiation assembly as its availability is correlated to the
formation of active eIF4F assembly in a linear form.
Consistent with previous studies, the eIF4E level did not
affect global protein translation[22–24], whereas knocking
down eIF4E decreased the ability of the cells to form
colonies.[25, 26] Yanagiya et al[24] have attributed the
observation that global protein translation is not decreased
despite the strong eIF4E reduction to the fact that hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 levels are also reduced after
knocking down eIF4E.
Since a direct inhibitor targeting the eIF4E level
is currently not available, several studies have aimed at
targeting eIF4E using indirect approaches.[27, 28] An
important upstream regulator of the eIF4E pathway is
mTOR, a serine/threonine protein kinase that functions
by phosphorylating eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BPs).
[29] The mTOR pathway has been shown to be
constitutively activated in a high percentage of B-cell
lymphomas, [11, 30, 31] however, some lymphomas
develop resistance to mTORC1 inhibition. Indeed,
multiple clinical trials report modest tumor response
rates to single-agent mTORC1 inhibitors in many types
of relapsed NHL, Hodgkin lymphoma and Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia.[9] Gupta et al have demonstrated
before that mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin resulted

Patient samples. Tissue microarrays (TMA) were
constructed using triplicate 0.6-mm cores from paraffinembedded DLBCL tissue blocks (n = 142) and included
10 nonmalignant tonsil controls. The TMA was obtained
through the University of Iowa/Mayo Lymphoma SPORE.
All patients provided written consent for use of their
samples and outcome information and the master protocol
was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the
Mayo Clinic and University of Iowa. Normal B cells were
isolated using CD19 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) from
peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors.
Cap affinity assay (m7GTP). Briefly eight to
ten million cells were washed with ice-cold 1x PBS
(Phosphate-Buffered Saline) followed by lysis with
cap binding buffer (20 mM pH7.2 Hepes, 1mM EDTA,
100 mM KCL, 10% v/v glycerol, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol,
50 mM glycerophosphate, 50 mM Sodium fluoride) using
four freeze-thaw cycles. 7-Methyl GTP-Sepharose beads
were added to the lysates and incubated at 4°C for 3 hours
with rotation. Subsequently, the beads were washed to
dissolve the protein bound to the beads and western blot was
performed with specific antibodies.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, qualitative and quantitative
RT-PCRs (Q-PCR) were performed as previously described.
[13] The following primers were used for Q-PCR: c-Myc
forward, 5′- GACGACGAGACCTTCATCAAAAAC-3′, and
c-Myc reverse, 5′-AGGCCAGCTTCTCTGAGAC-3′; Mcl-1
forward, 5′- CTGGGATTGAGAGGTTGATGAATG-3′, and
Mcl-1 reverse, 5′- TGCCCAATCAGAGCCCATTATTTG-3′;
Cyclin D3 forward, 5′-GGCCCTCTGTGCTACAGA
TTATACC-3′; Cyclin D3 reverse, 5′-CGCAGGCAGTC
CACTTCAGTG-3′;
Glyceraldehyde-3
phosphate
dehydrogenase (GADPH) forward, 5′-ATCACCATCTTCC
AGGAGCG-3′ and GADPH reverse, 5′-CAAATGAGC
CCCAGCCTTC-3′.
Transient transfection for adherent cells. For
plasmid transfection, cells were transfected with 5 μg of
plasmids such as PCDNA3.1, eIF4EWT and eIF4Ecap mutant
using lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Grand
Island, NY, USA) and Opti-MEM medium. For small
interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments, cells were
transfected with 50 nM c-Myc siRNA and control siRNA
using lipofectamine 2000 reagent.

Western blotting. Western blotting was performed
as described before.[35] Densitometry was performed using
AlphaImager Software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA).
Colony formation assay. HEK293T cells were
treated accordingly and were incubated for 6 days. Cells
were washed, fixed and stained with a staining solution
(0.06% coomassie blue, 45% methanol and 10% acetic
acid). Colonies were counted using colony count program
on Alphaimager IS-3400 (Alpha Innotech, CA, USA).
3
H leucine incorporation assay. 1 X 105 cells
were treated accordingly for 48 hours. Then cells were
incubated for 24 h in the presence of 2 μCi/ml leucine.
10% trichloroacetic acid was added and cells were
incubated for another 30 min at 4ºC. Cells were lysed with
0.4N Sodium hydroxide and transferred in triplicates in a
96 well plate. 3H leucine radioactivity was determined by
liquid scintillation spectrometer.
Cell survival by annexin V/Propidium iodide.
Annexin V/PI binding was assayed as described.[11]
Luciferase cap dependent transfection. Jeko cells
were transfected with luciferase plasmid (pRF) using
Amaxa Cell Line Nucleofector kit as per manufacturer’s
instructions. Plasmid pRF was a kind gift from Dr. Gregory
Goodall.[36] The luciferase assay was performed using a
dual-luciferase report assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI,
USA) as per the manufacturer’s instruction.
Thymidine incorporation. 3H-thymidine incorpo­
ration assay as described before.[37]
Polysome analysis. Polysome analysis was performed
as described earlier with some modifications.[38, 39] 70–90
million cells were seeded and treated accordingly overnight.
Cells were treated with 0.1mg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) for
3min at 37°C and then, cells were collected. All subsequent
procedures were carried out on ice. Cell lysates were loaded
on10–50% sucrose density gradients and sedimented
for 3hrs at 35000 rpm in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 4ºC.
Gradients were fractionated, and the optical density (OD)
at 254 nm was counted using density gradient fractionating
system (Brandel, MD). RNA was precipitated using lithium
chloride.
Immunohistochemistry (IHC). DLBCL cases
(n = 132) were classified into GCB or non-GCB
molecular type based on the Hans algorithm applied to
paraffin-embedded tumor samples.[40] IHC on tissue
microarray was performed using eIF4E antibody and IgG
control as previously described.[41] A 10% cut off was
chosen for eIF4E positivity. Slides were reviewed by a
hematopathologist (A.D).
Statistics. Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as
time from diagnosis to progression, relapse, re-treatment,
or death due to any cause. Associations between eIF4E
status and EFS were assessed using Cox proportional
hazards models and Kaplan Meier curves. The p-value for
in-vitro data was calculated using the means from 3 different
experiments (two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test).
