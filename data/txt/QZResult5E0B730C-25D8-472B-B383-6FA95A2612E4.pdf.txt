ABSTRACT:
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive brain cancer, and
to date, no curative treatment has been developed. In this study, we report that
miR-211, a microRNA predicted to target MMP-9, is suppressed in grade IV GBM
specimens. Furthermore, we found that miR-211 suppression in GBM involves
aberrant methylation-mediated epigenetic silencing of the miR-211 promoter. Indeed,
we observed a highly significant inverse correlation between miR-211 expression
and MMP-9 protein levels, which is indicative of post-transcriptional control of
gene expression. Additionally, shRNA specific for MMP-9 (pM) promoted miR-211
expression via demethylation of miR-211 promoter-associated CpG islands (-140
to +56). In independent experiments, we confirmed that miR-211 overexpression
and pM treatments led to the activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial/Caspase9/3-mediated apoptotic pathway in both glioma cells and cancer stem cells (CSC).
We also investigated whether miR-211 is involved in the regulation of MMP-9 and
thus plays a functional role in GBM. We found an acute inhibitory effect of miR211 on glioma cell invasion and migration via suppression of MMP-9. Given the
insensitivity of some GBMs to radiation and chemotherapy (temozolomide) along
with the hypothesis that glioma CSC cause resistance to therapy, our study indicates
that miR-211 or pM in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) and temozolomide
significantly induces apoptosis and DNA fragmentation. Of note, miR-211- and pMtreated CSC demonstrated increased drug retention capacity, as observed by MDR1/Pgp mediated-Rhodamine 123 drug efflux activity assay. These results suggest that
either rescuing miR-211 expression or downregulation of MMP-9 may have a new
therapeutic application for GBM patients in the future.

INTRODUCTION

discovered only recently, miRNAs have been found to
influence cancer development in many ways, including
the regulation of cell proliferation, cell transformation,
and programmed cell death [2, 8]. Several studies have
reported that miRNA genes are often found in genomic
regions linked to cancer [9, 10], and miRNA expression
profiles are correlated with the developmental lineage and
the differentiation state of tumors [11].
In this study, we focused on miRNA-211 (miR-211),
which plays a functional role in the regulation of apoptosis
and tumor progression. The expression of miR-211 is

Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators
of gene expression, including microRNAs (miRNAs), are
being investigated as a relatively new and important class
of oncogenes and tumor suppressors [1-5]. The miRNAs
comprise a class of evolutionarily conserved small RNAs
(22 nts long) that affect gene expression at the posttranscriptional level by blocking translation or degrading
target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) [6, 7]. Although

greatly decreased in melanoma cells and melanoblasts
compared to melanocytes, and recent studies showed
that overexpression of miR-211 causes suppression of
tumor invasion in melanoma [12, 13]. Using experimental
and bioinformatic approaches, we selected miR-211,
a commonly downregulated miRNA, and analyzed its
relationship to the expression of glioblastoma antigen
(MMP-9), which is also a potential target of miR-211.
Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) acts as an important
oncogene that enhances the invasiveness of cancer
cells [14], and prior research demonstrates that a high
level of MMP-9 confers a poor prognosis in a variety
of cancers [15, 16]. Earlier studies also showed that the
siRNA-mediated knockdown of MMP-9 expression in
glioma cells induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth
[17, 18]. Apart from its key role in tumor invasion, the
elevated expression of MMP-9 in different cancers
is also implicated in increased tumor progression,
including metastasis and shorter survival times [16, 1921]. Recently, the MMP-9-specific miRNA expression
profile was established via miRNA microarrays as a
potential target of anti-invasion therapy in glioblastoma
[22]. Two miRNAs, miR-885-5p and miR-491-5p, were
determined to reduce the level of MMP-9 and inhibit
cellular invasion in U251 and U87 glioma cells. In the
present study, we investigated the functional role of miR211 in inducing glioma cell apoptosis via suppression of
MMP-9. Moreover, we observed that the shRNA-mediated
downregulation of MMP-9 (pM) resulted in significant
upregulation of miR-211 in GBM cells. Recently, case
report studies on childhood glioblastoma suggested that
MMP-9 upregulation could be associated with tumor
resistance to temozolomide at relapse [23]. In the present
study, we demonstrated that either the downregulation of
MMP-9 (pM) or overexpression of miR-211 increases
chemo- and radio-sensitivity of glioma CSC, suggesting
that rescuing miR-211 expression may have a new
therapeutic application in the treatment of GBM patients
in the future. We also provide preliminary evidence of the
epigenetic control of miR-211 by MMP-9 overexpression
in GBM but the mechanisms underlying this regulation
needs further investigation.

33 specimens of glioblastoma and 5 specimens of
normal brain tissue, duplicate cores per case. Fig. 1A
shows that the GBM tissue specimens (F3 and F4) have
low endogenous miR-211 levels when compared to
the normal cerebrum tissues (H6 and H7). Further, the
immunohistochemistry analysis performed to examine
the MMP-9 protein levels in the GBM specimens
demonstrated an inverse correlation between miR211 expression and MMP-9 protein levels. The GBM
tissues with low miR-211 levels showed significantly
higher expression of MMP-9 protein; conversely, the
normal cerebrum (NC) tissues with high levels of miR211 showed lower expression of MMP-9 protein (Fig.
1A). Overall, the analysis showed that the miR-211 level
was inversely correlated with MMP-9 level in a total
of 25 GBM specimens (p<0.001). Further, the in situ
hybridization analysis of intracranial tumors obtained
from 4910 xenograft cells in nude mice also revealed low
endogenous levels of miR-211 in GBM control cells (Fig.
1B). Interestingly, the intracranial brain tumors treated
with shRNA specific for MMP-9 (pM) showed noticeably
increased miR-211 levels. However, the expression levels
of miR-211 remained low in the MMP-9 overexpression
construct (MMP-9 OE) treated intracranial mice brain
tumors (Fig. 1B). For further in vitro investigation into the
inverse correlation between MMP-9 protein and miR-211,
we examined the relative expression levels of miR-211
using miR-quantitative stem-loop PCR analysis in empty
vector (EV), pM and MMP-9 OE-treated 4910 and U87
cells. We observed that the downregulation of MMP-9
resulted in a significant increase in miR-211 levels whereas
the overexpression of MMP-9 showed little decrease or
no obvious differential expression of miR-211 (Fig. 1C).
Moreover, from the miRanda [24] and TargetScan [25]
software for microRNA target prediction, we found that
miR-211 targets 103-109 nts of 3’-UTR of MMP-9, which
is highly conserved across nine species (Fig. 1D). These
data suggest that miR-211 may target oncoproteins, such
as MMP-9, and act as a tumor suppressor in GBM cells.
To further investigate the downregulation of miR211 in GBM cells, we considered an alternative mechanism
of miRNA downregulation by epigenetic transcriptional
silencing [26]. We analyzed the DNA methylation status
at known or predicted transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of
the miRNA-211 promoter in ten human grade IV GBM
tissues (GB1-GB10) (from surgical biopsy specimens) by
methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis. The genomic
DNA from the tumor tissues was subjected to bisulfite
treatment, which converts unmethylated cytosine to
uracil while leaving 5-methylcytosine unchanged. Two
methylation-specific primer sets were designed to amplify
either methylated (M) or unmethylated (U) bisulfitemodified sequence in the miR-211 promoter (Fig. 1E). Of
note, all the GBM specimens showed aberrant miR-211
promoter hypermethylation when compared to normal
brain (NB) tissue, which showed no evidence of promoter

RESULTS
The miR-211 levels inversely correlate with
MMP-9 protein in GBM cells and MMP-9-specific
methylation of CpG island region (-140 to +56) of
miR-211 promoter.
To determine the basal expression levels of miR211 in glioblastoma tissue specimens, we first performed
in situ hybridization analysis to examine the expression
levels of miR-211 in a GBM tissue microarray containing

hypermethylation. These results suggest the presence
of dense methylation of the miR-211 promoter region
(-140 to +56) in GBM cells. Further, we also investigated
whether the negative correlation between MMP-9 and
miR-211 expression was associated with altered DNA
methylation of miR-211 promoter. We analyzed the DNA
methylation status of miR-211 promoter region (-140
to +56) in control, pM, 5-Aza-CdR and MMP-9 OEtreated 4910 and U87 cells and found that the control
and MMP-9 OE cells showed prominent PCR products
with the methylated primer but no products were detected
with the unmethylated primer. Interestingly, the active
demethylating agent, 5-Aza-CdR-treated cells and the cells
knocked down for MMP-9 (pM) showed methylationspecific PCR (MSP) products in the unmethylated lane,
indicating demethylation of miR-211 promoter CpG island
(Fig. 1E). The demethylation of miR-211 promoter with
pM treatment suggests transcriptional activation of miR211, which is consistent with our in situ hybridization and
miR-quantitative PCR analysis (Figs. 1B and 1C).

I) and apoptosis-related molecules (Fig. 2C, Panel II) in
miR-211- and pM-treated cells when compared to control
4910 and U87 cells. The immunoblot analysis showed that
the expression levels of cell proliferation and survivalassociated molecules, such as cyclin D1, ERK and pERK
were decreased whereas the levels of cell cycle inhibitors,
such as p-cdc2, p53, p-p53 and XIAP were increased with
miR-211 and pM treatments (Fig. 2C Panel I). The pivotal
role of MMP-9 in enhancing glioma tumor migration,
invasion and angiogenesis has already been well studied
[30]. Furthermore, the role of MMP-9 inhibition (pM) in
inducing Caspase-9-mediated apoptosis in SNB19, a GBM
cell line, has been shown earlier [31]. The immunoblot
results obtained from the suppression of MMP-9 and
overexpression of miR-211 in 4910 and U87 cells were
comparable and elicited similar anti-proliferative and
apoptotic signaling mechanisms. The results demonstrated
a significant increase in the fragmentation and proteolytic
activity of Caspase-9 with miR-211 and pM treatments
when compared to the control cells. In particular, the
cleaved 35 kDa fragment of Caspase-9 increased, which
suggests the activation of Caspase-9 after the treatments.
The activated Caspase-9 then triggers pro-apoptotic
pathways through the proteolytic cleavage and activation
of effector caspases, such as Caspase-3 (Fig. 2C Panel II).
Caspases have been shown to contribute to mitochondrial
disruption during apoptosis [32] and further we tested
whether Caspase-9 activation was involved in this process
using the MitoLight™ mitochondrial apoptosis detection
kit. We observed that both the overexpression of miR-211
as well as suppression of MMP-9 caused mitochondrial
apoptosis in GBM cells (Fig. 2B). The mitochondrial
disruption along with the activated effector caspases
enhances the apoptosis signal through enzyme activation
and degradation of hundreds of intracellular protein targets
[33]. Apart from activation of Caspase-9, we also observed
a significant increase in the apoptosome-associated
molecule, Apaf-1, which suggests the activation of the
mitochondrial/Caspase-9/3-mediated apoptotic pathway.
Oligomerization of the pro-apoptotic multi-domain Bcl-2
family members, such as Bax, in the outer mitochondrial
membrane seems to be obligatory to initiate mitochondrial
dysfunction in most apoptotic stimuli. In contrast, antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, such as Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL, appear to stabilize mitochondria by inhibiting
the formation of such oligomers. Importantly, the ratio
of pro- and anti-apoptotic protein expression, such as
Bax/Bcl-2 determines a cell’s susceptibility to undergo
apoptosis [34, 35]. In the present study, the constitutive
expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
decreased after miR-211 and pM treatments, whereas the
expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax increased,
thereby demonstrating a shift in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in favor
of apoptosis in treated cells when compared to the control
cells. These observations show that both the miR-211
and pM treatments induce apoptosis, which is primarily

Both miR-211 overexpression (miR-211) as well as
MMP-9 downregulation (pM) affect cell viability
and induce apoptosis in GBM cells.
To determine whether the overexpression of miR211 in GBM cells, with lower endogenous miR-211 levels,
can affect MMP-9 protein expression and cell viability,
the 4910 and U87 cells were transiently transfected
with a miR-211-overexpressing plasmid. The cell cycle
progression was analyzed by FACS (Fig. 2A), which
demonstrated a significant decrease in G0/G1 phase of
4910 and U87 cells with miR-211 overexpression when
compared to control and empty vector (EV)-treated cells.
This concomitant decrease in the percentage of cells in
G1 phase was associated with significant cell cycle arrest
in G2/M phase, with a smaller reduction in the S phase
population (Fig. 2A). Earlier studies in our lab have
demonstrated the role of shRNA specific for MMP-9 (pM)
in the induction of G2-M arrest and apoptosis in cancer
cells [18, 27]. However, G2-M arrest precedes apoptosis
[28] and after the G2-M arrest tumor cells are known to
exhibit morphologic changes consistent with apoptosis
[29]. To further evaluate the role of miR-211 and pM in
the induction of apoptosis in glioma cells, GBM cells were
transfected with miR-211 and pM plasmids. We observed
that the miR-211 and pM treatments decreased the
number of cells in the culture dishes. To confirm whether
the decrease in the number of viable cells following
miR-211 and pM treatments was due to the induction of
apoptosis, we stained the cells with TUNEL. We found
that the numbers of cells stained with TUNEL were
higher following the miR-211 and pM treatments (Fig.
2B). Next, immunoblotting was performed to detect the
altered expression of cell cycle regulatory (Fig. 2C, Panel

and migration [37, 38], and suppression of MMP-9 in
GBM cells significantly inhibits the invasion, migration
and metastatic ability of these cells [17, 39]. Since the
overexpression of miR-211 suppressed MMP-9 protein
and showed inverse correlation, we investigated further
the miR-211 role in glioma cell migration and invasion.
We compared the migration and invasive ability of control
4302 and 4910 CSC to those cells treated with miR-211
alone and in combination with IR (Figs. 4A and 4B).
The IR-treated glioma CSC showed increased spheroid
migration and invaded through Matrigel more extensively
when compared to the equal number (5×104) of control
CSC. However, miR-211 in combination with IR treatment
significantly decreased the IR-induced migratory and
invasive ability of glioma CSC (Figs. 4A and 4B). We
further investigated the miR-211-mediated mechanisms
that alter invasive and metastatic potential of 4302 and
4910 CSC. The initiation of metastasis via migration and
invasion has many phenotypic similarities to epithelial
mesenchymal transition (EMT) [40]. EMT is characterized
by the loss of epithelial marker E-cadherin and the gain
of mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin, Vimentin
and β-catenin. The immunoblot analysis of cells treated
with miR-211 alone and in combination with IR showed
suppression of N-cadherin, Vimentin and β-catenin
expression whereas showed increased expression of
E-cadherin when compared to the control 4302 and
4910 CSC. In contrast, we observed that IR induced
the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin and β-catenin
proteins in glioma CSC (Fig. 4C). These results suggest
that the miR-211 suppresses EMT by inducing MET-like
phenotype in glioma CSC. The western blot results also
demonstrated reduced basal levels of Smad-1, Smad-3
and TGF-β proteins in miR-211 and IR-treated cells when
compared to control glioma CSC (Fig. 4C).

miR-211 suppresses MMP-9 expression levels and
sensitizes glioma stem cells to ionizing radiation
(IR).
Since radiation and multi-drug resistance are the
characteristic properties of cancer stem cells (CSC) and
tumor initiating cells of various tumor origins, there is
increasing interest in establishing a clear association
between miRNA expression in tumors and chemo- and
radiosensitivity, with regard to predicting or modulating
sensitivity [36]. To examine the effect of miR-211 on
the disintegration of glioma CSC spheres, we conducted
sphere disintegration assay followed by 5 days of IR
treatment. The results showed a remarkable increase of
sphere disintegration with miR-211 treatment. However,
the greatest effect of disintegration was observed in miR211 treatment accompanied with ionizing radiation (IR)
(Fig. 3A), suggesting that miR-211 is more effective
in inhibiting the functions of cancer stem-like cells. To
confirm whether the increased sphere disintegration
following miR-211 treatment was due to apoptosis, we
performed immunoblot analysis of 4302 and 4910 control
and miR-211-treated CSC alone and in combination
with IR treatment. We assessed proteolytic cleavage
and activation of Caspase-3 and cleaved PARP. The
overexpression of miR-211 showed significant increase
in the levels of cleaved Caspase-3 and PARP, which was
further enhanced in combination with IR treatment (Fig.
3B). Since miR-211 levels inversely correlate with MMP9 protein levels, we examined the expression levels of
MMP-9 in miR-211 and IR-treated glioma CSC using
RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses. We observed that with
the IR treatment, the total levels of MMP-9 increased
(p<0.01) when compared to control CSC. Notably, this
IR-induced MMP-9 protein was suppressed upon miR211 overexpression. Furthermore, the MMP-9 activity,
as examined by gelatin zymography, increased with IR
treatment whereas, this IR-induced MMP-9 activity was
retarded by 60% and 59% in miR-211 overexpressing
4302 and 4910 CSC respectively. These results suggest
that the inhibitory effect of miR-211 on glioma cell
proliferation, at least in part, is mediated via suppression
of MMP-9 (Fig. 3C). We also confirmed the miR-211induced apoptosis in CSC spheres of 4302 and 4910 cells
using TUNEL assay (Fig. 3D).

MiR-211; a modifier of chemotherapy in glioma
CSC
The fraction of tumor cells expressing CD133
(Prominin-1), a marker for both neural stem cells and brain
cancer stem cells, display strong capability on tumor’s
resistance to chemotherapy including temozolomide.
These drug resistant CD133-positive cells also show
higher expression of the anti-apoptosis and inhibitors of
apoptosis protein families [41]. Studies have shown that
CD133-expressing glioma cells survive ionizing radiation
and chemotherapy in increased proportions relative to
most tumor cells that lack CD133 [42-44]. In the present
study, we observed increased CD133 expression in glioma
CSC (p<0.001) when compared to glioma parental cells
(non-CSC). This CSC-induced CD133 expression was
significantly inhibited upon treatment of 4302 and 4910
CSC with miR-211 and pM alone and in combination with
temozolomide (Fig. 5A). CSC are known to contribute to

glioma chemoresistance through preferential activation
of the DNA damage checkpoint response and an increase
in DNA repair capacity [45]. Since miR-211 and pM
treatments caused increased apoptosis via caspase-9/3
activation in glioma cells and CSC (Figures 2 and 3), we
examined the apoptotic DNA laddering profile of miR211- and pM-treated glioma CSC alone or after subjecting

them to a sublethal dose of temozolomide. The miR-211and pM-treated glioma CSC showed increased apoptotic
DNA fragmentation when compared to the temozolomidetreated CSC, thus confirming their significant role in
apoptotic induction (Fig. 5B). The combination treatments
of miR-211 and pM with temozolomide showed low
levels of CD133 and significantly enhanced apoptotic

DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5A and 5B). The classic multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanism involves alterations
in the expression of highly evolutionarily conserved
plasma membrane glycoproteins, P-glycoprotein (P-gp)
and the multi-drug resistance protein (MRP) that actively
transports drugs out of the cell or microorganism [46,
47]. The expression levels of P-gp and MRP have been
shown to be increased after chemotherapy in GBM
patients [48]. To further determine the role of miR-211
and pM in chemosensitivity, we performed the rhodamine
123 efflux assay. The assay measures P-gp-mediated
efflux by the decrease in the intracellular fluorescence of
rhodamine 123 (R123, a MDR1/P-pg substrate) using flow
cytometry. Intracellular rhodamine 123 was measured at

time 0 (load) and after 2 h of efflux in control, miR-211
and pM-treated glioma CSC (Fig. 5C panel a). The efflux
was measured by the number of cells in the M1 region
of the plot. We found enhanced R123 efflux from the
glioma CSC, which indicates greater P-gp activity, when
compared to the normal glioma cells (non-CSC). The miR211 (CSC + miR-211) and pM (CSC + pM) treatments
showed significant retention of R123 in CSC, suggesting
lower P-gp activity. To confirm the specificity of the R123
efflux from the control and treated CSC, we employed
a P-gp blocker, vinblastin. The R123 efflux assays were
performed in the presence of this inhibitor, and the
results are shown in Figure 5C panel b. The vinblastin at
concentrations of 22 uM was able to significantly reduce

the efflux of R123 from the glioma CSC, thus confirming
that the decrease in efflux from miR-211- and pM-treated
CSC was due to a decrease in P-gp expression and
activity. These results suggest that targeting miR-211 and/
or MMP-9 in cancer stem cells may overcome this radioand chemoresistance and provide a therapeutic model for
malignant GBM.

aggressive brain cancer, and no curative treatment
is currently available. Despite improved surgery and
chemo-radiotherapy approaches, the median survival
time for patients with GBM remains less than one year
[49]. The dismal prognosis of GBM is mainly due to the
poor response of patients to any therapeutic modality.
Thus, it is very important to find new biomarkers that
can predict clinical outcomes and make good potential
drug targets. MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs
that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene
expression and play a key role in pathogenesis of GBM

Figure 4: miR-211 suppresses the migratory and invasive potential of glioma CSC. (A) 4302 and 4910 CSC spheres were

seeded in 24-well plates. The CSC spheroids were either treated with empty vector (EV) or miR-211 alone or in combination with IR
treatment. After 16 h, the media was replaced with fresh complete media. The spheroid migration distance was measured after 48 h and is
represented graphically in terms of relative migration (*, p<0.01; **, p<0.001). (B) The treated 4302 and 4910 CSC were disintegrated
into single cell suspension by trituration and an equal number (5×104) of spheres were suspended in serum-free media and plated onto
Matrigel-coated Transwell inserts as described in Materials and Methods. After a 24-hr incubation period, lower invaded spheres were
stained with Hema-3. Images of invaded spheres were taken under a light microscope (Olympus IX-71). The invasive potential of treated
spheres was quantified and the percentage of cells invading from 3 independent experiments is graphically represented as bar diagrams.
Error bar represents mean + standard deviation (SD) (*, p<0.01; **, p<0.001). (C) Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates (40 µg) from
control, EV and miR-211-treated 4302 and 4910 CSC to assess the expression of various EMT-associated proteins. GAPDH was used as a
loading control. (D) Schematic representation shows that miR-211 mediates negative regulation of MMP-9 and plays a functional role in
inhibition of glioma cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The miR-211, which is predicted to target MMP-9, is suppressed in GBM
grade IV specimens. Furthermore, we observed that downregulation of MMP-9 using shRNA specific for MMP-9 (pM) promoted miR211 expression via demethylation of miR-211 promoter-associated CpG island (-140 to +56). In light of these observations, we interpret a
negative feedback loop between miR-211 and MMP-9 and suggest that either rescuing miR-211 expression or downregulation of MMP-9
may have a new therapeutic application for the treatment of GBM patients in the future.

[50]. Although discovered only recently in the early
1990s, the expression of miRNAs has been demonstrated
to correlate with clinical outcomes in GBM. Despite
the fact that there is only limited data available so far,
these initial results are very promising and indicate that
miRNAs might open a new perspective for diagnostics
and treatment of different cancers, including GBM. In the
present study, we demonstrated that miR-211 expression

is suppressed in grade IV GBM specimens and the
expression of miR-211 was inversely related to MMP-9
protein levels. We found that the overexpression of miR211 in glioma cell lines retards MMP-9 activity, induces
apoptosis and DNA damage response (DDR). In the last
few years, the important role of the DDR pathway in
tumor formation and modulation of therapeutic response
has been appreciated. One of the primary reasons for

CSC, and the results were compared with untreated CSC and normal cancer cells (non-CSC). GAPDH was used as a loading control. (B)

to determine the role of miR-211 and pM in chemosensitivity. The assay measures P-gp-mediated efflux by the decrease in the intracellular

(load) and after 2 h of efflux in control, miR-211- and pM-treated glioma CSC (panel a). The efflux was measured by the number of cells
in the M1 region of the plot. To confirm the specificity of the R123 efflux from the control and treated CSC, we employed a P-gp blocker,
vinblastin. The R123 efflux assays were performed in the presence of this inhibitor (panel b). The percentage of cells with R123 retention
was quantified both in the absence (panel a) and in the presence of P-gp blocker, vinblastine (panel b) from 3 independent experiments and

treatment failure in GBM is local invasion, and recently,
there has been an increase in information regarding
specific molecules that determine the aggressiveness and
invasion potential of high-grade astrocytic tumors. In
particular, expression levels of matrix metalloproteases
(MMPs) in high-grade gliomas appear to correlate with
tissue invasiveness and are prognostically significant. The
overexpression of MMP-9 in the invasive front of different
malignant tumors is linked to poor clinical outcome.
Previous studies have demonstrated that downregulation
of MMP-9 not only reduced the invasive nature but also
subsequently led to ERK and AKT-mediated apoptosis
in meningioma and medulloblastoma cells [51, 52]. The
siRNA-mediated knockdown of MMP-9 expression has
also been shown to induce Caspase-9-mediated apoptosis
in glioma cells [31]. Molecular analysis of the signaling
cascades that lead to apoptosis is essential for delineating
cell death events and for the development of novel cancer
therapeutics. The results of the present study showed
that both the overexpression of miR-211 (miR-211)
and suppression of MMP-9 (pM) induced activation of
intrinsic mitochondrial/Caspase-9/3-mediated apoptotic
pathway. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-211
significantly suppressed MMP-9 activity in glioma cells,
as demonstrated by gelatin zymography. Thus, we assume
that the anti-proliferative, anti-invasive and apoptotic
effect of miR-211 on glioma cells is associated with the
downregulation of MMP-9 activity.
More than 90% of cancer patient mortality is
attributed to metastasis [53] and both in vitro and in
vivo observations indicate that apoptosis is an important
process regulating metastasis [54]. When we examined
the metastatic ability of glioma cells after miR-211 and
pM treatments, we found downregulation of TGF-β/Smad
signaling. TGFβ can promote cancer metastasis through
its effects on the tumor microenvironment by enhancing
invasive properties and inhibiting immune cell function.
The downstream transducers of the TGF-β pathway, the
Smads, are also altered in cancer tissues. Additionally,
TGF-β can regulate the expression, secretion, and activity
of matrix metalloproteases MMP-2 and MMP-9. The
Smad-dependent, TGF-β pathway plays a key role in the
induction of EMT, and vvarious studies have explored
the roles of TGF-β-activated Smads in EMT [55, 56].
Further, TGF-β-induced EMT often coincides with the loss
of E-cadherin expression [57, 58]. In the present study,
miR-211 and pM treatments decreased the expression of
mesenchymal markers (e.g., N-cadherin, vimentin and
β-catenin) and enhanced the expression of the epithelial
marker E-cadherin, thus inducing a MET-like phenotype
in glioma cells.
Recently, miR-211 is shown as a suppressor of
melanoma invasion, and its expression is silenced or
selected via suppression of the entire melastatin locus
during human melanoma progression [12]. The present
study is the first report showing the anti-proliferative and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

anti-invasive role of miR-211 in glioma cells. We found
that miR-211 overexpression inhibits MMP-9 activity and
downregulation of MMP-9 (pM) further promotes miR211 expression in vitro and in vivo. Further, we observed
that MMP-9 overexpression does not have much effect on
the basal expression of miR-211 in glioma cells but has
a significant role in the methylation-mediated silencing
of the miR-211 promoter. Thus, we assume that the role
of MMP-9 overexpression in methylation of the miR-211
promoter may be necessary to ensure continued silencing
of miR-211 in malignant GBM cells.
Mammalian DNA is predominantly methylated at
the C-5-position of complimentary CpG bp by concerted
action of three DNA methyltransferases namely, Dnmt1,
Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b [59]. This epigenetic modification is
essential for mammalian development and its aberrations
lead to a variety of diseases including cancer [60-62].
The miRs harboring CpG islands undergo methylationmediated silencing, a characteristic of many tumor
suppressor genes. This epigenetic modification of miRNA
promoters serve as unrealized potential targets of cancer
therapy. Evidence presented in this study points at the
possible connection between miR-211 overexpression
and MMP-9 downregulation; however, future studies are
required to further investigate this connection.
Elevated plasma levels of MMP-9 have been
found in lung cancer, breast cancer and liver cancer
during radiotherapy [63, 64]. Sublethal doses of
radiation have been shown to induce MMP-9 expression
in medulloblastoma, meningioma, and hepatocellular
carcinoma [51, 63, 65]. Moreover, MMP inhibitors have
been shown to block radiation-induced invasion and
metastasis of human pancreatic cancer cells [66]. Further,
a case report study of a 13-year-old boy with GBM
showed local recurrence fourteen months after surgical
resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide
chemotherapy. The clinical outcome in this case was
correlated with increased expression of MMP-9 [23].
Further, miRNAs are emerging as a class of endogenous
gene modulators that control protein levels, thereby
adding a new layer of regulation to the DNA damage
response [67]. Recently, several miRNAs were shown to
influence sensitivity to chemo- or radiotherapy and indeed,
different miRNAs have been found to predict sensitivity
to anti-cancer treatment such as miR-30c, miR-130a and
miR-335 are downregulated in various chemoresistant
cell lines [68] and the hsa-Let-7g and hsa-miR-181b
are strongly associated with response to 5-fluorouracilbased antimetabolite S-1 [69]. Recent studies showed
that the miRNA-221 and miRNA-222 may present novel
targets for radiosensitization due to their regulation of
the PTEN/AKT pathway in tumor cells [70]. Given the
insensitivity of some GBMs to radio- and chemotherapy
(temozolomide) and the hypothesis that glioma stem cells
cause resistance to drug therapy, we investigated whether
miR-211 endows radiosensitivity to glioma cancer
1448

stem cells by synergistic downregulation of MMP-9. In
combination with miR-211 overexpression and inhibition
of MMP-9, even the sublethal dose of ionizing radiation
(5 Gy) was sufficient to cause significant disruption of
neurospheres and DNA fragmentation in glioma stem
cells. The MDR1/P-gp-mediated-Rhodamine 123 drug
efflux activity was also shown to be suppressed with
miR-211 overexpression, thus demonstrating its role in
increased drug retention by chemosensitization of glioma
stem cells.
In conclusion, our study suggests that the oncogene
MMP-9 could be negatively regulated at the posttranscriptional level by miR-211. Furthermore, we
show that the miR-211 induced apoptosis and had antiproliferative and anti-invasive effects in glioma cells (Fig.
4D). These data along with our data from the GBM tissue
array and intracranial xenograft model of brain tumors
may support a strategy for targeting the miR-211/MMP9 interaction or rescuing miR-211 expression as a new
therapeutic application to treat GBM patients in the future.

irradiated neurospheres were incubated for 5 days.

Chemotherapy compound
Temozolomide (T2577) was purchased from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The 4302 and 4910 CSC were
treated with temozolomide (500 µM). Cytotoxicity was
determined after 48 h of incubation.

Glioblastoma (GBM) tumor specimens
Glioblastoma specimens (Grade IV) were obtained
during autopsies of glioblastoma patients within 24 h of
death or from patients who underwent surgery at Saint
Francis Medical Center (Peoria, IL). All samples were
collected under protocols approved by the UICOMP
(Peoria, IL) Institutional Review Board.

Plasmids and shRNA constructs, antibodies and
reagents

MATERIALS AND METHODS

We purchased PLKO-mcherry-luc-puro-miR-211
construct for the overexpression of miR-211 and empty
vector (EV) from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). The
shRNA construct designed to knockdown MMP-9 (pM)
and the MMP-9 overexpression construct (MMP-9 OE)
were generated in our laboratory [30]. Control cells
were processed in the same way as treated cells and
were incubated with equal volumes of FuGene HD. The
following antibodies: anti-MMP-9, Cyclin D1, p-Cdc2
p34 (Thr14/Tyr15), p-p53 (ser 15), p53, pERK1/2, ERK,
Caspase-9 p35, Apaf-1, Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Smad-1,
Smad-3, β-catenin, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Vimentin and
CD133 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA). Caspase-3 and TGFβ-1 were purchased
from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA), and PARP-1 was
purchased from VWR (San Dimas, CA). A protease
inhibitor cocktail was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO). Protein concentration was estimated using the
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

Cell lines, cancer stem cell (CSC) neurospheres,
transfection, and ionizing radiation (IR)
U87 cells obtained from the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) (Frederick, MD) and 4910 xenograft cell
line (a kind gift from Dr. David James, University of
California, San Francisco) were maintained in DMEM
and RPMI-1640 respectively [71]. The primary culture
of 4302 derived from a human GBM specimen (a kind
gift from Dr. Jeremy Rich, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland,
OH) and parental 4910 cells were subjected to cancer stem
cell (CSC) neurosphere formation as described previously
[71, 72]. Primary neurospheres were obtained in five to
six days and were subsequently disturbed by trituration;
the single cell suspension obtained was then plated
for secondary neurospheres formation. Neurospheres
of around 8-12 passages were used for this study. All
transfection experiments were performed with FuGene HD
transfection reagent (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, plasmid/shRNA
was mixed with FuGene HD reagent (1:3 ratio) in 200500 µL of serum free-medium and left for 30 min at room
temperature (RT). The complex was then added to a 6-well
or 100-mm plate containing 1 mL or 5 mL of serum-free
medium, and around 2 µg plasmid per mL of medium
was used. After 8 h of transfection, complete medium
containing 10% FBS was added and the neurospheres
were incubated for 48-72 h. For combination treatments,
a radiation dose of 5 Gy was given using the RS 2000
Biological Irradiator X-ray unit (Rad Source Technologies
Inc., Boca Raton, FL) after 48 h of transfection, and the

Immunoblotting
Immunoblot analysis was carried out using equal
amounts of protein resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred
onto nitrocellulose membrane (Biorad, Hercules, CA),
incubated with 1:500 dilution of primary antibodies, and
subsequently incubated with 1:1000 dilution of speciesspecific, HRP-conjugated secondary antibody as per
standard protocols [65].

gels were stained with 0.1% amido black in 10% acetic
acid and 10% isopropanol and subsequently destained for
1 hr. Gelatinolytic activity was identified as clear zones of
lysis against a dark blue background.

MiR-quantitative real time-PCR (RT-PCR)

Progression through different cell cycle phases was
monitored by flow cytometric analysis of DNA content
in cell populations stained with propidium iodide and
was carried out with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter
(FACS Caliber flow cytometer; Becton Dickinson). The
percentages of treated cells in various cell cycle phases
(G0/G1, S, and G2/M) were analyzed by FACS as
described previously [65]. The TUNEL assay was done
using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied
Science, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, treated cells were fixed for 24 h in 8-well
chambered slides with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Next, cells were incubated
with a TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37°C in
a humidified incubator. The slides were washed three
times with PBS and the incorporated biotin-dUTP was
detected under a fluorescence microscope. Mitochondrial
membrane potential changes were assayed with
MitoLight dye according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Millipore, Danvers, MA). 48 h after treatment, cells
were incubated with pre-diluted MitoLight solution for 30
min. Cells were washed twice with 1X incubation buffer,
mounted with cover slips, and observed immediately
under a fluorescence microscope. The apoptotic DNA
fragmentation analysis was done using TACSTM DNA
Laddering Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. About 1×106
cells were lysed, and the DNA was extracted under stable
conditions. The DNA was estimated, and around 200 ng
of DNA was electrophoresed on 1.5% TreviGel 500 gel
in 1X TAE buffer and visualized using ethidium bromide
staining.

Total RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the standard
protocol. For miRNA analysis, 10 ng of template RNA
diluted to a final concentration of 2 ng/μL was reverse
transcribed using first-strand cDNA synthesis kit and miR211-specific RT primers from the miRCURY LNATM
microRNA polymerase chain reaction system (Exiqon,
Vedbaek, Denmark) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The miR-211 transcript levels were examined
by RT-PCR using the CFX96TM Real Time System (BioRad) in triplicate and the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The following
PCR conditions were used: 95°C for 10 min, followed by
50 cycles at 95°C for 10 sec and 60°C for 30 sec. The
expression level of miR-211 in pM and MMP-9 OE
treatments was normalized to control (untreated) cells,
and the fold change was calculated using 2-ΔΔCt, where
ΔΔCT = ΔCT of treatment – ΔCT of control.

Bisulfite modification of genomic DNA and
methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction
Genomic DNA was isolated from 4910 and U87
control, pM, 5-Aza-CdR (5 µm, Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) and MMP-9 OE-treated cells and GBM grade
IV specimens using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen).
Bisulfite reaction was carried out on 5 µg of genomic
DNA using EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen) following
the supplied protocol. The MSP for aberrant gene
promoter methylation was performed as previously
described [74]. MSP was carried out using bisulf﻿ite
modified DNA (200 ηg) in a total volume of 25 μL. We
used the following MSP primers: methylated-MSP (M)
5’-TGGTTTATTAGGAAAAGTTGTAGATTTTC-3’
(sense) and 5’-CTACCCTACTCAAAACCCTAAACG-3’
(antisense);
unmethylated-MSP(U)
5’TGGTTTATTAGGAAAAGTTGTAGATTTTT-3’ (sense)
and 5’- TACCCTACTCAAAACCCTAAACAAA-3’
(antisense). PCR conditions were: 95°C for 10 min; then
40 cycles at 95°C for 45 sec, 50°C for 45 sec, and 72°C for
45 sec; and a final extension of 10 min at 72°C. Negative
control MSP reactions were performed using water only
as a template. PCR products were verified by 2% agarose
gel electrophoresis.

Glioma CSC migration and Matrigel invasion
assay
The migration of CSC neurospheres and Matrigel
invasion were carried out using previously established
protocols [39, 52].

Gelatin zymography
MMP activity in conditioned medium was
determined by gelatinase zymography as we described
previously [73]. After 48 h of treatment, the glioma
cells and CSC were incubated overnight with serumfree medium. Conditioned medium containing equal
amounts of protein were electrophoresed on 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gels containing 1.5 mg/mL gelatin. The

Rhodamine 123 (R123) efflux assay

In situ hybridization (ISH)

R123 efflux assay was performed using Multidrug
Resistance Direct Dye Efflux Assay kit (Millipore,
Danvers, MA) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The
assay measures MDR1/P-gp-mediated efflux by the
decrease in the intracellular fluorescence of rhodamine
123 (R123, a MDR1/P-pg substrate) using flow cytometry.
Around 2.5×105 cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in
the R123 loading buffer. The R123 solution was removed
from the extracellular medium by centrifugation, and the
cells were resuspended separately into warm efflux buffer
containing DMSO and 22 µM Vinblastin, a MDR1/P-pg
blocker. For the negative control, the cells were incubated
in ice-cold efflux buffer. After a 1 h incubation period,
fluorescence of R123 was collected through a 530/30 nm
bandpass on a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BectonDickinson, San Jose, CA). After gating for live cells,
10,000 cells were recorded for each sample and processed
by Cell Quest software (Becton-Dickinson).

The miRCURY LNA™ microRNA ISH
Optimization Kit (FFPE) and full-length miR-211
hybridization probe were purchased from Exiqon
(Woburn, MA). In situ hybridization was carried out as
per the manufacturer’s instructions [76]. In brief, paraffinembedded tumor tissue sections were subjected to
deparaffinization and the following steps were performed:
proteinase-K treatment at 370C, pre-hybridization at 550C
for 15 min, hybridization with DIG-labeled LNA miR-211
probe (50 nM) at 550C for 60 min, stringent washes with
SSC buffers at 550C for a total of 33 min followed by DIG
blocking reagent (15 min at RT), alkaline phosphataseconjugated anti-DIG at 1:1000 dilution (60 min at RT),
alkaline phosphatase-substrate; enzymatic development
(120 min at RT), and nuclear fast red counterstain (5
min). The slides were mounted and air dried, and the
images were captured with an Olympus BX61 fluorescent
microscope attached with a CCD camera.

Surgical orthotopic implantation

Bioinformatic approach

2×105 4910 xenograft glioblastoma cells were
injected intracerebrally into nude mice as previously
described [75]. Tumors were allowed to grow for 10 to
12 days, and the animals were separated into groups (six
animals per group). Alzet osmotic pumps (model 2004,
ALZET Osmotic Pumps) were implanted for plasmid
delivery (dose: 3–6 mg/kg body weight) as described
previously [30]. After 6 weeks or when the control animals
started showing symptoms, the animals were euthanized.
The brains were collected and fixed in buffered
formaldehyde. To visualize tumor cells and to examine
tumor volume, the brain sections were stained with H&E.

Computational predictions of putative miR-494
binding sites in the 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR) of
MMP-9 was done using target prediction algorithms,
miRanda [24] and TargetScan [25]. Human miR-211
sequences of the RFAM miRNA registry [77] were
downloaded from the miRBase website (http://microrna.
sanger.ac.uk/sequences/index.shtml).

Statistics
All data are presented as means ± standard deviation
(SD) of at least three independent experiments (each
performed at least in triplicate). One-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) combined with the Tukey post-hoc
test of means were used for multiple comparisons in cell
culture experiments. Statistical differences are presented at
probability levels of p<0.05, p<0.01 and p<0.001.

Immunohistochemistry
For immunohistochemical analysis, tissue sections
(5–6 μm thick) were deparaffinized in xylene and
rehydrated in graded ethanol solutions. Antigen retrieval
was carried out with 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6) at
boiling temperature for 60 min and permeabilization in
0.1% Triton-X-100. The tissue sections were incubated
with primary antibody for MMP-9, incubated with HRPconjugated secondary antibodies, followed by DAB
peroxidase substrate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) solution,
counterstained with hematoxylin, and mounted. The
images were captured with an Olympus BX61 fluorescent
microscope attached with a CCD camera.
