Noscapine, a Benzylisoquinoline Alkaloid, Sensitizes
Leukemic Cells to Chemotherapeutic Agents
and Cytokines by Modulating the
NF-κB Signaling Pathway
Bokyung Sung, Kwang Seok Ahn, and Bharat B. Aggarwal

Abstract
Noscapine, a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid derived from opium, was recently reported to exhibit activity
against a variety of cancers through a poorly understood mechanism. Because the transcription factor NF-κB
has been linked with inflammation, survival, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis in tumors, we hypothesized that noscapine mediates its effects by modulating the NF-κB activation pathway. We found that noscapine
potentiates apoptosis induced by cytokines and chemotherapeutic agents in tumor cells. Noscapine alone suppressed proliferation of human leukemia and myeloma cells and downregulated the constitutive expression of
cell survival proteins. Noscapine also abrogated the inducible expression of proteins involved in survival, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis, all of which are regulated by NF-κB. Noscapine suppressed both inducible
and constitutive NF-κB activation in tumor cells through inhibition of IκB kinase, leading to inhibition of phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. Noscapine also suppressed phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of
p65, leading to inhibition of NF-κB reporter activity induced by various components of the NF-κB activation
pathway. Activity of the NF-κB–containing cyclooxygenase-2 promoter was also inhibited by noscapine. Thus,
noscapine inhibits the proliferation of leukemia cells and sensitizes them to tumor necrosis factor and chemotherapeutic agents by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway. Cancer Res; 70(8); 3259–68. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Noscapine (also called narcotine, nectodon, nospen, and
anarcotine) is a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid derived from
the opium poppy Papaver somniferum. This alkaloid lacks
sedative activity and has been used as a cough suppressant
for decades, with no evidence of toxicity or side effects (1). In
1998, noscapine was shown to have potent antitumor activity
against murine lymphoid tumors through its binding to tubulin and inhibition of microtubule assembly (2). Since then,
noscapine has been shown to exhibit activity against a wide
variety of tumors in vitro and in vivo, including leukemia and
lymphoma (3, 4), melanoma (5), ovarian cancer (6), gliomas
(7), breast cancer (8), lung cancer (9), and colon cancer (10).
This alkaloid also sensitizes human gliomas to taxol and radiation (11). Noscapine inhibits the growth of tumor cells
with little toxicity to normal cells (12).

How noscapine exhibits its antitumor effects is not fully
understood, but various mechanisms including its ability
to inhibit microtubule assembly (2), suppress expression of
hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (13), induce p21 and p53 (10),
induce apoptosis-inducing factor (14), activate c-Jun NH2terminal kinase (6), repress Bcl-2 (9), and activate p34
(cdc2) have been implicated. Like paclitaxel, noscapine is
a microtubule-interacting agent, but it can efficiently inhibit the growth of both paclitaxel-sensitive and paclitaxelresistant ovarian cancer cells (6), indicating that noscapine
may mediate anticancer effects through other mechanisms.
Because of the critical role of NF-κB in inflammation and tumor cell survival, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, radioresistance, and chemoresistance (15, 16), we hypothesized
that noscapine mediates its effects through modulation of
the NF-κB signaling pathway.
NF-κB is a transcription factor that consists of five proteins: c-Rel, RelA (p65), RelB, NF-κB1 (p50 and p105), and
NF-κB2 (p52; ref. 17). Under resting conditions, NF-κB consists of a heterotrimer of p50, p65, and IκB subunit α (IκBα)
residing in the cytoplasm (18). NF-κB is activated by a sequence involving the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and
degradation of IκBα, and the phosphorylation of p65, which
in turn lead to the translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus,
where it binds to specific response elements in the DNA
(19). NF-κB regulates the expression of several genes whose
products are involved in tumorigenesis, including antiapoptotic proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, cIAP, survivin, and TRAF1);

cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2); matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9);
genes encoding adhesion molecules, chemokines, and inflammatory cytokines; and cell cycle regulatory genes (e.g., cyclin
D1 and c-Myc; ref. 15).
Because of the critical role of NF-κB in most cancers and
leukemia in particular, we investigated the effects of noscapine on proliferation of leukemia cells, on apoptosis induced
by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and chemotherapeutic
agents, on NF-κB–regulated gene products, and on the NFκB activation pathway. We found that noscapine is a potent
inhibitor of activation of IκBα kinase (IKK), which is required
for NF-κB activation. Noscapine suppressed the NF-κB pathway, inhibited various gene products, inhibited proliferation,
and potentiated apoptosis in leukemia cells.

NF-κB–dependent reporter gene expression assay. The
effect of noscapine on TNF-induced NF-κB–dependent reporter gene transcription in A293 cells was measured as described previously (21).
Luciferase assay. The effect of noscapine on COX-2 promoter activity induced by TNF was analyzed using a luciferase
assay. A293 cells were transfected with COX-2 promoterluciferase reporter DNA. After 24 h of transfection, the cells
were incubated with noscapine for 12 h, exposed to 1 nmol/L
TNF for 20 h, and harvested. Luciferase activity was measured
using a luciferase assay system (Promega).
Cytotoxicity assay. Cytotoxicity was assayed by the MTT
assay as described previously (21).
Live/dead assay. To assess cytotoxicity, we used a live/
dead assay (Invitrogen), which determines intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity. In brief, 1 × 106
cells were incubated with 25 μmol/L noscapine for 12 h and
then treated with 1 nmol/L TNF for 16 h at 37°C. Cells were
stained with the live/dead reagent (5 μmol/L ethidium
homodimer and 5 μmol/L calcein-AM) and incubated at
37°C for 30 min. Cells were analyzed under a fluorescence
microscope (Labophot-2, Nikon).
Annexin V assay. To detect apoptosis, we used Annexin V

1 nmol/L TNF for 24 h, and subjected to Annexin V staining.
Cells were washed, stained with FITC-conjugated antibody to
Annexin V, and analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur,
BD Biosciences).
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling assay. We assayed cytotoxicity by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) method using an in situ cell death detection reagent (Roche Pharmaceuticals). In brief, 1 × 106 cells
were pretreated with 25 μmol/L noscapine for 12 h and with
1 nmol/L TNF for 24 h at 37°C. Thereafter, cells were incubated with reaction mixture for 60 min at 37°C. Stained cells
were quantified by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur).

Results
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of noscapine
(Fig. 1A) on the NF-κB signaling pathway, NF-κB–regulated
gene products, and NF-κB–mediated cellular responses such
as survival, proliferation, chemosensitization, invasion, and
angiogenesis in leukemia cells. The concentration of noscapine we used, and the duration of exposure, had minimal effect
on cell viability as determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion
test (data not shown), suggesting that the effects of noscapine
on the NF-κB signaling pathway are not due to its cytotoxic
effects. To examine the effect of noscapine on the NF-κB activation pathway, we used TNF because the pathway activated
by this agent is relatively well investigated. For most studies,
we used human leukemia and myeloma cells.
Noscapine potentiates apoptosis induced by TNF and
chemotherapeutic agents. Inflammatory cytokines, such as
TNF, and chemotherapeutic agents have been shown to activate NF-κB. Because NF-κB activation has been shown to

effects. D, left, noscapine enhances TNF-induced caspase activation. Cells were pretreated with 25 μmol/L noscapine for 12 h and then incubated

suppress the apoptosis induced by various chemotherapeutic
agents (22–24), we examined the effect of noscapine on apoptosis induced by TNF and chemotherapeutic drugs. As determined by the MTT assay, noscapine significantly potentiated
the cytotoxic effects of TNF, thalidomide, paclitaxel, and bortezomib in human leukemia KBM-5 cell lines (Fig. 1B). We also
determined the dose of noscapine required to inhibit cell
growth by 50% (IC50) either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. We found that the IC50 of noscapine for
KBM-5 cells decreased from 84.4 μmol/L when used alone to
53.6, 18.9, 15.2, and 16.5 μmol/L when combined with TNF
(1 nmol/L), thalidomide (10 μg/mL), paclitaxel (5 nmol/L),
and bortezomib (16.5 μmol/L), respectively. Similarly, for
U266 cells, the IC50 was 155, 72, 47.5, 64.5, and 62.8 μmol/L
when used alone or in combination with TNF, thalidomide,
paclitaxel, or bortezomib, respectively.
To determine whether noscapine potentiates apoptosis,
we used the live/dead assay, which examines intracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity. Noscapine
enhanced TNF-induced apoptosis in KBM-5 human chronic
myeloid leukemia cells (Fig. 1C, left, top) and U266 human

3262

multiple myeloma cells (Fig. 1C, left, bottom). We also used Annexin V staining to examine apoptosis by membrane phosphatidylesterase exposure and found that noscapine potentiated
TNF-induced early apoptosis from 5% to 33% (Fig. 1C, right,
top). Similarly, when we examined apoptosis by DNA strand
breaks using the TUNEL method, we found that noscapine
enhanced apoptosis from 6% to 38% (Fig. 1C, right, bottom).
Noscapine potentiates TNF-induced caspase activation
and PARP cleavage. TNF binds to TNFR1, which then sequentially recruits TNF receptor (TNFR)–associated death
domain (TRADD) and TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), leading to activation of NF-κB and recruitment of Fas-associated
death domain, which ultimately leads to activation of caspases
(23). We investigated whether noscapine affects TNF-induced
activation of caspase-8 (also called FLICE) and caspase-3. TNF
alone had a minimal effect on activation of caspase-8 or
caspase-3, whereas treatment with noscapine potentiated
the activation, as indicated by the presence of cleaved caspases
(Fig. 1D, left). We also used the PARP cleavage assay to detect
TNF-induced apoptosis. Again, noscapine potentiated the effect of TNF-induced PARP cleavage, although noscapine alone

resulted in minimal PARP cleavage (Fig. 1D, right). These
assays show that noscapine enhances the apoptotic effects
of TNF and chemotherapeutic drugs.
Noscapine suppresses cell proliferation and enhances
apoptosis in cancer cells. We examined whether noscapine
alone can modulate the proliferation of various tumor cell
types. Noscapine by itself suppressed the proliferation of human leukemic cells (such as KBM-5 and HL-60), T-cell lymphoma cells (Jurkat and HuT-78), and multiple myeloma cells
(U266 and RPMI-8226; Fig. 2A). Besides the hematologic tumor cells, noscapine also suppressed the proliferation of
solid tumor cells, such as human prostate cancer DU145
and head and neck cancer SCC4 cells.
We then assessed whether the suppression of cell proliferation by noscapine results from modulation of constitutive expression of tumor cell survival proteins, such as cFLIP, cIAP-1,

analysis using the relevant antibodies. Antiapoptotic (A), proliferative (B),

cIAP-2, XIAP, survivin, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and TRAF1. In
U266 multiple myeloma cells, noscapine downregulated the
expression of all of the aforementioned antiapoptotic proteins (Fig. 2B). Next, we also examined whether noscapine
affects the expression of proapoptotic proteins. Noscapine
induced the expression of proapoptotic Bax in human multiple myeloma U266 cells (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that
noscapine causes inhibition of proliferation of tumor cell
and further enhances apoptosis.
Noscapine suppresses TNF-induced, NF-κB–dependent
antiapoptotic proteins. Our results above show that noscapine potentiates the apoptotic effects of TNF and chemotherapeutic agents, both known to activate NF-κB. The latter is
known to regulate expression of antiapoptotic proteins such
as cIAP-1, XIAP, TRAF1, Bcl-2, and survivin, all of which play
a major role in evading apoptosis and prolonging survival of
cancer cells (15). We examined whether noscapine modulates
TNF-induced expression of these antiapoptotic proteins. TNF
induced the expression of antiapoptotic proteins in a timedependent manner, whereas noscapine markedly suppressed
TNF-induced expression of these proteins (Fig. 3A).
Noscapine represses inducible NF-κB–dependent cell
proliferation proteins. Various gene products, including
cyclin D1 and COX-2, are induced by TNF and have been
linked with proliferation of tumor cells (19). Cyclin D1 regulates the cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase and is overexpressed in a variety of tumors (25). COX-2 is an enzyme
that catalyzes the production of prostaglandin E2 and has
been linked to proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells
(26). We examined whether noscapine modulates the expression
of proliferative gene products induced by TNF. TNF induced the
expression of cyclin D1 and COX-2 in a time-dependent manner, whereas noscapine significantly inhibited their expression
(Fig. 3B). These results suggest a molecular mechanism on
how noscapine suppresses tumor cell proliferation.
Noscapine suppresses TNF-induced proteins involved in
invasion and angiogenesis. Invasion and angiogenesis are
critical for tumor metastasis and are induced by TNF.
ICAM-1, MMP-9, and VEGF have been implicated in invasion
and angiogenesis (27–29). We therefore examined whether
noscapine can suppress the expression of these proteins.
TNF treatment induced the expression of VEGF, MMP-9,
and ICAM-1 in a time-dependent manner, whereas noscapine
inhibited their expression (Fig. 3C). These results suggest a
potential mechanism on how this alkaloid suppresses invasion and angiogenesis.
Noscapine inhibits TNF-induced NF-κB activation.
Because all of the gene products mentioned above are regulated by NF-κB, we examined whether noscapine modulates
the activation of NF-κB. EMSA revealed that noscapine alone
had no effect on NF-κB activation; however, noscapine inhibited TNF-mediated NF-κB activation in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 4A). The suppression of NF-κB activation by
noscapine was also time dependent (Fig. 4B).
Noscapine-induced inhibition of NF-κB activation is not
cell type specific. Because distinct signal transduction pathways can mediate NF-κB induction in different cell types
(30), we examined the effect of noscapine on TNF-induced

of noscapine for 12 h, treated with 0.1 nmol/L TNF for 30 min, and subjected to EMSA to test for NF-κB activation. B, effect of noscapine exposure
time. Cells were preincubated with 50 μmol/L noscapine for the indicated times, treated with 0.1 nmol/L TNF for 30 min, and then subjected to EMSA to
test for NF-κB activation. Inhibition of NF-κB activation by noscapine is not cell type specific. To determine the effect of noscapine on inducible NF-κB
activation (C), A293 and H1299 cells were incubated with 50 μmol/L noscapine for 12 h and then incubated with 0.1 nmol/L TNF for 30 min. To determine
the effect of noscapine on constitutive NF-κB activation (D), U266 and DU145 cells were incubated with indicated concentrations of noscapine for
12 h. Nuclear extracts were then prepared and assayed for NF-κB activation by EMSA.

NF-κB activation in human embryonic kidney A293 cells and
human lung adenocarcinoma H1299 cells. Noscapine inhibited TNF-induced NF-κB activation in both cell types (Fig. 4C).
Noscapine inhibits constitutive NF-κB activation in
tumor cells. We next tested the effect of noscapine on NFκB activation in U266 human multiple myeloma and DU145
human prostate cancer cells, which express constitutively active NF-κB (31, 32). Treatment with various concentrations of
noscapine suppressed constitutive NF-κB activation in both
cell types (Fig. 4D).
Noscapine inhibits TNF-dependent IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. The translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus is preceded by the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and
proteolytic degradation of IκBα (33). To determine whether
inhibition of TNF-induced NF-κB activation by noscapine is
caused by inhibition of IκBα degradation, we pretreated cells
with noscapine and then exposed them to TNF for various
time periods. EMSA showed that NF-κB was activated with
increasing TNF incubation times, and noscapine pretreatment markedly decreased this activation (Fig. 5A). Western
blot analysis showed that TNF induced IκBα degradation
in control cells within 5 minutes, reaching maximum degra-

dation at 15 to 30 minutes, but TNF could not induce IκBα
degradation in noscapine-pretreated cells (Fig. 5B, left, top).
These results indicate that noscapine inhibits both TNFinduced NF-κB activation and IκBα degradation.
We next determined whether noscapine affects the TNFinduced IκBα phosphorylation needed for IκBα degradation.
TNF induced IκBα phosphorylation in control cells within
5 minutes, but noscapine-pretreated cells inhibited the phosphorylation of IκBα (Fig. 5B, left, second panel from top).
Phosphorylated IκBα rapidly undergoes degradation. To
stabilize phosphorylated IκBα, we used N-acetyl-leucylleucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), which suppresses degradation of
IκBα by the 26S proteasome. Western blot analysis using
an antibody to the serine-phosphorylated form of IκBα
showed that TNF induced IκBα phosphorylation, whereas
noscapine suppressed it (Fig. 5B, right).
Noscapine inhibits TNF-induced activation of IKK.
Because IKK is needed for the phosphorylation of IκBα, we tested the effect of noscapine on TNF-induced IKK activation. Noscapine suppressed TNF-induced activation of IKK (Fig. 5C, left,
top). Neither TNF nor noscapine had any effect on the expression of IKKα or IKKβ proteins (Fig. 5C, left, bottom two panels).

Noscapine Sensitizes Leukemic Cells through NF-κB

We next examined whether noscapine suppresses IKK
activity directly by binding to the IKK protein. An immune
complex kinase assay of whole-cell extracts from untreated
and TNF-treated cells showed that noscapine did not directly
affect the activity of IKK, suggesting that noscapine does not
directly inhibit IKK but rather modulates the activation of
IKK induced by TNF (Fig. 5D, right).

Noscapine inhibits nuclear translocation of p65. Suppression of IκBα degradation is known to inhibit the translocation of p65 to the nucleus. We examined whether
noscapine inhibits nuclear translocation of p65 induced by
TNF. TNF induced the nuclear translocation of p65 in as little
as 5 minutes of incubation, whereas noscapine suppressed
p65 translocation (Fig. 5D, top).

to Western blot analysis using antibody to phosphorylated IκBα. The same membrane was reblotted with antibody to IκBα. C, left, noscapine inhibits

Figure 6. Noscapine represses NF-κB–dependent reporter gene
expression induced by TNF and various plasmids. A, noscapine inhibits
the NF-κB–dependent reporter gene expression induced by TNF. A293
cells were transiently transfected with a NF-κB–expressing plasmid for
24 h. After transfection, cells were incubated with noscapine for 12 h and
then treated with 1 nmol/L TNF for an additional 24 h. The
supernatants of the culture media were assayed for SEAP activity.
B, noscapine inhibits the NF-κB–dependent reporter gene expression
induced by TNF, TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, TAK1/TAB1, IKKβ, and
p65. Cells were transiently transfected with a NF-κB–expressing
plasmid alone or with plasmids expressing the indicated proteins. After
transfection, cells were incubated with 25 μmol/L noscapine for 12 h
and then incubated with the relevant plasmid for additional 24 h.
TNF-treated cells were incubated with 25 μmol/L noscapine for 12 h and
then treated with 1 nmol/L TNF for an additional 24 h. The supernatants
of the culture media were assayed for SEAP activity. C, noscapine inhibits
the COX-2 promoter activity induced by TNF. Cells were transiently
transfected with a plasmid expressing a luciferase reporter gene under
control of the COX-2 promoter for 24 h and then treated with noscapine for
12 h. Cells were then treated with 1 nmol/L TNF for an additional 24 h,
lysed, and subjected to a luciferase assay. Data in A to C are shown as fold
activity over the activity of the vector control with the mean ± SD of the
results of at least three independent experiments.

The phosphorylation of p65 is required for the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. We assessed whether noscapine affects TNF-induced phosphorylation of p65. In the nuclear
fraction of TNF-treated cells, there was a time-dependent in-

3266

crease in the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536; this phosphorylation was suppressed by noscapine (Fig. 5D, middle).
Noscapine represses TNF-induced, NF-κB–dependent
reporter gene expression. We investigated whether noscapine modulates NF-κB–dependent reporter gene transcription. TNF produced an 8-fold increase in NF-κB–dependent
expression of secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) activity
over vector control (Fig. 6A). When the cells were pretreated
with various concentration of noscapine, TNF-induced NFκB–dependent expression of SEAP was inhibited in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 6A). These results show that noscapine
inhibits NF-κB–dependent reporter gene expression induced
by TNF.
We next determined where noscapine acts in the TNFinduced NF-κB activation pathway that is sequentially linked
through TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NF-κB–inducing kinase
(NIK; refs. 34, 35), transforming growth factor-β–activated kinase 1 (TAK1)/TAK1-binding protein (TAB1; ref. 36), and IKK
recruitment. Transfection of cells with plasmids expressing
TNFR1, TRADD, TRAF2, NIK, TAK1/TAB1, IKKβ, or p65 induced NF-κB–dependent reporter gene expression; noscapine suppressed reporter gene expression induced by all
plasmids except p65 (Fig. 6B), indicating that noscapine acts
at a site upstream to p65.
Noscapine inhibits TNF-induced COX-2 promoter activity.
TNF induces COX-2, which has NF-κB binding sites in its
promoter (37). Because downregulation of NF-κB by noscapine suppressed the expression of NF-κB–regulated gene products, including COX-2, we examined the effect of noscapine
on TNF-induced COX-2 promoter activity using a COX-2 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid. TNF induced COX-2 promoter activity, whereas noscapine suppressed this activity in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C). This result suggests that
noscapine inhibits NF-κB–regulated gene expression by suppressing NF-κB binding to the COX-2 promoter.

Discussion
The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by
which noscapine mediates antitumor effects. Because NF-κB
has been linked to survival, proliferation, chemoresistance,
invasion, and angiogenesis, we investigated the effects of noscapine on the NF-κB signaling cascade. We found that noscapine inhibited the proliferation of various tumor cell lines;
potentiated the apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents;
suppressed the expression of antiapoptotic gene products that
are regulated by NF-κB; and inhibited NF-κB activation through
inhibition of IKK activation, IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα
degradation, and p65 phosphorylation. Thus, we have identified NF-κB as a novel target for the action of noscapine.
We found that noscapine inhibits the proliferation of various
tumor cell lines, including T-cell leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, prostate cancer, and
squamous cell carcinoma. These results agree with previous reports that this alkaloid inhibits the growth of leukemia and lymphoma (3, 4), melanoma (5), ovarian cancer (6), gliomas (7),
breast cancer (38), lung cancer (9), and colon cancer (10). We
found that the inhibition of cell proliferation by noscapine is

Noscapine Sensitizes Leukemic Cells through NF-κB

associated with downregulation of constitutive NF-κB activation and inhibition of expression of survivin, cIAP-1, cFLIP,
XIAP, Bcl-xL, TRAF1, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1. Our results agree with
a report that noscapine suppresses Bcl-2 expression (9).
Besides antiapoptotic proteins, noscapine also downregulates the expression of proteins linked to cell proliferation (cyclin D1), inflammation (COX-2), invasion (MMP-9),
adhesion (ICAM-1), and angiogenesis (VEGF). These observations imply that noscapine has anti-inflammatory, antiangiogenic, and antimetastatic activities. In hypoxic human
glioma cells, noscapine has been shown to inhibit the secretion of VEGF (13).
We also found that noscapine suppresses TNF-induced
NF-κB activation. The suppression of NF-κB activation was
accompanied by inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, as a result of inhibition of IKK activation. Numerous kinases have been implicated in the activation of IKK,
including TAK1, which plays a major role in TNF-induced
IKK activation. We found that noscapine inhibits TAK1induced NF-κB reporter activity. Thus, TAK1 may be a direct
target of noscapine in the NF-κB pathway. We found that
noscapine also abrogated nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of p65, which has been linked to IKK (39). The
inhibition of p65 phosphorylation by noscapine may therefore result from its inhibition of IKK.
Noscapine has been reported to suppress the transcription
factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 in human gliomas (13). We
now find that noscapine also inhibits the NF-κB pathway.
Although noscapine binds tubulin and suppresses microtubule assembly, like paclitaxel, noscapine also suppresses
growth of paclitaxel-resistant cells, suggesting a difference
in the mechanisms of action of the two compounds. Whereas noscapine inhibits NF-κB activation, paclitaxel has been
shown to activate NF-κB. Our results indicate for the first
time that unlike most other inhibitors of microtubule assembly (40), noscapine exhibits anti-inflammatory activities.
Whether all these activities are interconnected, however, is
not certain. It is also not clear whether metabolites of noscapine, such as meconine, cortarnine, and hydrocotamine (41),
are involved in additional activities. Vinblastine-resistant
human T-lymphoblastoid cells have been shown to undergo
apoptosis when exposed to noscapine analogues (4). Because
NF-κB activation has been closely linked to drug resistance,
this noscapine-induced sensitization of tumor cells to che-

motherapeutic agents may be mediated through downregulation of NF-κB, as described above. This may also explain how
noscapine overcomes resistance to paclitaxel. Unlike paclitaxel, noscapine is highly water soluble, well tolerated, and
highly bioavailable (10). Noscapine alone has been shown
to suppress the growth of a variety of tumors in rodent models
(5, 8, 9, 42). Preclinical pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of
noscapine have been examined (43). The pharmacokinetics of
oral noscapine in 20 healthy volunteers given 100, 200, and
300 mg tablets of noscapine or 200 mg as a solution indicated
the terminal half-life of noscapine as 4.5 h, which was independent of formulation or dose (44). A phase I/II clinical trial with
noscapine for non–Hodgkin's lymphoma and for multiple myeloma are in progress (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). Thus,
this agent should be explored further for its anticancer activities, alone or in combination with currently use chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, noscapine and analogues are likely to be
cost-effective as potential chemotherapeutic agents (45).
Overall, our results suggest that noscapine, a component
of opioids, mediates antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antiinvasive, antiangiogenic, and chemosensitive effects through
the suppression of NF-κB and NF-κB–regulated gene products. Our study suggests a novel function and a potential
use in cancer treatment for this ancient drug.
