ABSTRACT
NSC319726 (ZMC1) is a small molecule that reactivates mutant p53 by
restoration of WT structure/function to the most common p53 missense mutant
(p53-R175H). We investigated the mechanism by which ZMC1 reactivates p53R175H and provide evidence that ZMC1: 1) restores WT structure by functioning
as a zinc-metallochaperone, providing an optimal concentration of zinc to facilitate
proper folding; and 2) increases cellular reactive oxygen species that transactivate
the newly conformed p53-R175H (via post-translational modifications), inducing an
apoptotic program. We not only demonstrate that this zinc metallochaperone function
is possessed by other zinc-binding small molecules, but that it can reactivate other
p53 mutants with impaired zinc binding. This represents a novel mechanism for an
anti-cancer drug and a new pathway to drug mutant p53.
Significance: We have elucidated a novel mechanism to restore wild-type
structure/function to mutant p53 using small molecules functioning as zincmetallochaperones. The pharmacologic delivery of a metal ion to restore proper
folding of a mutant protein is unique to medicinal chemistry and represents a new
pathway to drug mutant p53.

INTRODUCTION

pharmacologically has been a highly sought after goal in
anti-cancer drug development [5-7].
We recently identified NSC319726 (hereafter
zinc metallochaperone-1, or ZMC1) as a mutant p53
reactivator and lead compound for mutant p53 targeted
drug development [8]. We observed that ZMC1 displayed
allele specific effects in that it reactivated the most
common missense mutant, p53-R175H, but not the R248
or R273 mutants. ZMC1 selectively killed p53-R175H
cancer cells through the restoration of wild-type (WT)
structure/function of the p53-R175H and initiation of a

TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in
human cancer for which no effective targeted anti-cancer
drug exists [1]. The majority of p53 mutations (>70%)
are missense, and generate a defective protein that is
found at high levels in cells due to the impairment of
Mdm2 mediated negative feedback [2-4]. Restoration
of p53 function in mouse tumor models has been shown
to be highly therapeutic, thus reactivating mutant p53

p53-mediated apoptotic program. These results we also
observed in vivo where ZMC1 inhibited xenograft tumor
growth in a p53-R175H dependent manner. ZMC1 belongs
to the family of thiosemicarbazone metal ion chelators
with affinity for cations such as Fe2+, Zn2+, Cu2+ and Mn2+
[9]. The mechanism of ZMC1 mediated p53-R175H
reactivation is currently unknown. Initially two properties
of the compound were identified that are important for
anti-tumor activity: zinc binding and redox changes [9].
Structural studies of WT p53 have shown that p53
requires a single zinc ion (coordinated by four amino acids
C176, H179 on the L2 loop, and C238, and C242 on the
L3 loop) for proper folding [10, 11]. There is now ample
biochemical and cellular evidence that manipulating zinc
concentrations can change the structure/function of WT
p53, indicating that the p53 structure is malleable [11-13].
A model of zinc-dependent folding and misfolding for
p53 was proposed by Loh and colleagues, in which p53
is properly folded only when one molecule of zinc binds
to the DNA binding domain (DBD; residues 94-312) [11,
14, 15]. A deficit of zinc results in loss of DNA binding
specificity, a surplus leads to misfolding and aggregation.
DBD misfolding is due to binding of zinc to one or more
non-native sites in p53 in conditions where zinc is in
excess. DBD contains 10 Cys and 9 His residues that can
potentially bind zinc.
In this model, small molecule metal-binding
compounds can have metallochaperone activity by serving
as a “sink and source” of zinc to facilitate coordination of
zinc in its proper position and thus facilitate proper p53
folding. The key is choosing a metal-binding compound
whose zinc affinity is less than that of the native p53
binding site. This allows the chelator to donate zinc to the
native site. At the same time, the affinity must be stronger
than that of the non-native binding sites to prevent zincinduced misfolding. Up to now, this concept has only been
demonstrated using purified WT DBD in vitro, and has
never been demonstrated for full length, tetrameric p53
inside cells much less applied to restore WT structure of a
missense mutant.
The relationship between p53 structure and zinc
also applies to certain p53 mutants in which the mutation
impairs zinc binding. This is best exemplified by p53R175H. Studies reveal that this mutant is misfolded at
physiologic temperatures due to an impairment in zincbinding, resulting in the loss of site-specific DNA binding
[11, 16]. It is hypothesized that this defect is present in
mutants of the zinc-coordinating residues (C176, C238,
C242, H179), but it is not known how many other mutants
to which this may apply.
We hypothesized that ZMC1 restores WT structure
and function to the p53-R175H by functioning as a zincmetallochaperone to restore proper zinc binding. We
aimed to determine if the model of zinc dependent folding
and misfolding put forth by Loh and colleagues applies
to p53-R175H and more broadly to other p53 mutants

with impaired zinc binding. We also sought to determine
if other zinc-binding small molecules could function as
zinc-metallochaperones. Lastly we explored the role that
redox changes induced by ZMC1 play in its mechanism
of action.

RESULTS
Binding interactions of ZMC1, DBD, and Zinc
To define the binding interactions involved in
ZMC1-mediated p53 reactivation, we sought to obtain
Kd values of ZMC1 and zinc, DBD and zinc, and DBD
and ZMC1. To measure the binding affinity of ZMC1 and
zinc, we titrated a solution of ZnCl2 into 10 µM ZMC1
and monitored the change in absorbance at 370 nm (Fig.
1A). Binding is stoichiometric and therefore the Kd is
too low to be measured at this concentration of ZMC1.
However, extrapolating the linear portions of the curve
to their point of intersection reveals that ZMC1 and Zn2+
form a 2:1 complex at saturation. To estimate the Kd we
turned to kinetic methods. We measured the dissociation
rate of the (ZMC1)2·Zn2+ complex by mixing it with a
large excess of EDTA in a stopped-flow apparatus and
monitoring the disappearance of the 370 nm absorbance
peak (Fig. 1B). The off-rate (2.6 ± 0.1 s-1) fits to a single
exponential function and is identical within error at two
different ZMC1:ZnCl2 concentrations (5:2.5 µM and 20:10
µM), indicating that dissociation is a first-order process.
Assuming a diffusion-limited association rate constant of
108 (M ZMC1 dimer)-1s-1 yields a Kd of ~3 x 10-8 M for the
reaction (ZMC1)2 + Zn2+ (ZMC1)2·Zn2+.
For use in negative control experiments we
synthesized compound A6 (Fig. 1C). A6 is identical
to ZMC1 except it replaces the thiocarbonyl group
with a carbonyl group to diminish its affinity for zinc.
Experiments similar to those in Fig. 1A confirm that A6
binds Zn2+ ~100-fold weaker than ZMC1 (Kd=1.1 x 10-6
M, Supplementary Fig. S1A). We further confirmed that
A6 failed to inhibit cell proliferation or induce a WT-like
conformation change in TOV112D (p53-R175H) detected
by immunofluorescence (IF) as has been previously shown
for ZMC1 (Supplementary Fig. S1B and C) [8].
To test the possibility that ZMC1 binds to DBD
(WT or R175H) directly, we performed equilibrium
dialysis between solutions of ZMC1:Zn2+ complex and
protein. ZMC1 appears to accumulate slightly on the
protein side for WT DBD but not enough to calculate aKd
(Supplementary Table S1). This putative interaction is
weaker still in the case of R175H DBD. We estimate that
if ZMC1 and DBD do interact, they do so with Kd>10-4 M.
Since ZMC1 induces apoptosis in cells at concentrations
as low as 10-8 M, it is unlikely that the mechanism involves
direct binding to DBD [8].

To determine the Kd between R175H DBD and Zn2+,
we performed competition assays with the colorimetric
zinc chelator 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol (PAR). The
affinity of WT DBD for zinc is too high to measure by
this technique [11]. We incubated 5 µM R175H DBD,
which purified with 0.6 molar equivalents of bound
zinc, with increasing amounts of PAR and measured the
concentration of PAR2·Zn2+at equilibrium by absorbance
(Fig. 1C). The data cannot be modeled by zinc binding to
a single site on R175H DBD. A minimum of two sites is
required: a strong site (Kd1) that accounts for one-third of
the bound zinc, and a weak site (Kd2) that accounts for the
remaining two-thirds. The weak site binds zinc too weakly
to compete with PAR, so we can only estimate a lower
limit of Kd2 ≥ 10-6 M. The strong site binds zinc tightly

enough to compete with PAR, and fitting this portion of
the curve yields Kd1 = (2.1 ± 0.8) x 10-9 M. These data
suggest that there are two populations of zinc bound
to freshly purified R175H DBD. The majority of Zn2+
is bound to a weak, presumably incorrect site(s), and a
minor fraction is bound to a high-affinity native site. The
intracellular concentration of free Zn2+, estimated to be
10-12-10-10 M [17], is 10 – 1000-fold lower than Kd1. We
therefore conclude that R175H most likely exists in the
cell in the zinc-free (apo) state, which explains its loss
of WT function in cancer. That we can purify R175H
with 0.6 equivalents of bound zinc, likely results from
a combination of factors including rapid purification at
low temperature, presence of trace amounts of Zn2+ in the
buffers, and lack of chelators present during purification.

ZMC1 rescues DBD from zinc-induced misfolding

transfer of Zn2+from ZMC1 to the proteins in real time.
We added 0–5 µM WT or R175H apoDBD to solutions
of 15 µM ZMC1/5 µM ZnCl2 and monitored transfer of
the metal from the drug to the protein by disappearance
of the (ZMC1)2·Zn2+ absorbance peak at 370 nm. The
transfer goes to completion in ~10 m regardless of the
protein concentration used (Supplementary Fig. S3).
We then used the amplitude of the absorbance change
to quantify the amount of zinc transferred as a function
of apo protein added (Fig. 2D). The data fit to lines with
slopes of 1.0 ± 0.1 μM Zn2+/μM WT DBD and 0.5 ± 0.1
μM Zn2+/μM R175H DBD. These stoichiometries are in
good agreement with those calculated by PAR assays (Fig.
2B), and that they are linear suggests that ZMC1 transfers
zinc to a single site on each protein.
We used electrophoretic mobility shift assays
(EMSA) to evaluate whether ZMC1 and zinc reactivate
R175H apoDBD for site-specific binding to a DNA
oligonucleotide bearing the p21 recognition sequence
(Fig. 2E). The combination of 10 µM ZnCl2 and 20
µM ZMC1 (Lane 5) restored DNA binding to R175H
apoDBD, but either one alone did not (Lane 3-4).20 µM
A6/10 µM ZnCl2failed to induce a shift in the DNA (Lane
6) indicating the importance of zinc binding to ZMC1’s
activity. Furthermore, 20 µM ZMC1/10 µM ZnCl2failed
to restore site-specific DNA binding to the DNA contact
mutant R248W (Lane 7-8). The ZMC1-inducedDNA shift
was sequence-specific as a mutant oligo containing 4/44
altered base pairs failed to undergo a shift (Supplementary
Fig. S4).
To evaluate the relevance of the 2:1 ZMC1:Zn2+
stoichiometry to the restoration of DNA binding, we
incubated R175H apoDBD with increasing concentrations
of ZMC1 while holding the concentration of zinc constant
at 10 µM (Fig. 2F). At 10 µM ZMC1 (1:1 molar ratio)
we did not observe a DNA shift. Under these conditions
the free zinc concentration is ~5 µM, which is greater
than Kd2 and therefore high enough to cause misfolding
(Supplementary Fig. S2). By contrast, the combination of
10 µM ZnCl2 and 20 – 40 µM ZMC1 resulted in a shifted
band. The shift is again lost at 50 µM ZMC1/10 µM ZnCl2,
probably because the free Zn2+concentration is reduced to
the point where R175H DBD becomes starved of metal.
In agreement, the shifted band reappeared when we
increased the concentration of ZnCl2 to 25 µM (restoring
the 2:1 ZMC1:Zn2+ ratio). These results suggest that
ZMC1-mediated activation of R175H DBD is primarily
dependent on the concentration of free zinc (rather than
total zinc), which is determined in large part by the ratio
of ZMC1 to Zn2+. Activation is likely to be robust over
a wide range of total zinc concentrations as long as the
ZMC1 concentration is maintained in moderate excess.
We next sought to determine if this relationship
also applied in p53-R175H cells. Growth inhibition
of TOV112D cells was maximal at 1-2 µM ZMC1, but
decreased at 10 µM ZMC1 (Fig. 2G). We surmised that

We hypothesized that ZMC1 restores native
structure and function to R175H DBD by functioning as a
metallochaperone. This hypothesis stipulates that ZMC1
must prevent zinc from binding to non-native sites on
DBD while simultaneously donating zinc to the native
pocket. We performed the arrested folding assay to test the
former. We previously showed that addition of more than
one equivalent of free Zn2+ to urea-denatured WT DBD
traps the protein in a misfolded state, preventing it from
folding upon dilution of urea [15]. Misfolding is likely
caused by zinc coordinating to one or more non-native
sites that become available when the protein unfolds. We
used Trp fluorescence to report on the conformational state
of DBD. Unfolded DBD is identified by a peak centered
at 355 nm, native DBD by an almost entirely quenched
fluorescence spectrum, and misfolded DBD by a peak
centered at 338 nm [15]. Addition of ZMC1 to WT and
R175H DBD, previously arrested in their misfolded states
by 2.5 µM ZnCl2, rapidly reverses misfolding and allows
both proteins to resume folding at their normal rates
(Supplementary Fig. S2). This effect is dose dependent
with 100% rescue achieved at 10 µM ZMC1 (Fig. 2A).
A6 has almost no effect on either protein. EDTA, which
binds zinc much more tightly than ZMC1 (Kd = 8.1 x 1014
M) yet is structurally dissimilar, is also able to rescue
misfolding. This result indicates that ZMC1 and EDTA
prevent misfolding via their common characteristic of zinc
binding, consistent with our proposed metallochaperone
mechanism [15]. However, our model predicts that ZMC1
will be able to restore function to R175H DBD, but not
EDTA, because EDTA binds Zn2+>10,000-fold tighter than
the Kd1 of R175H DBD.

ZMC1 restores native zinc binding to apoDBD
To test whether ZMC1 donates zinc to the WT and
R175H DBD native binding sites and restores native
structure, we incubated R175H and WT apoDBD (30
µM) with 60 µM ZnCl2 and 180 µM ZMC1 or 120 µM
EDTA, and measured their zinc contents by PAR assay.
EDTA does not remetallate either protein because it binds
zinc too tightly (Fig. 2B). By contrast, ZMC1 is able to
donate 0.91 (± 0.08) and 0.45 (± 0.04) equivalents Zn2+
per mole of WT and R175H DBD, respectively, which are
identical within error to the zinc contents of the freshly
purified proteins. The fluorescence spectra of the resultant
proteins also resemble native protein (Fig. 2C).The above
stoichiometry and the native-like fluorescence spectra
of the remetallated proteins together suggest that ZMC1
delivers zinc to the native pocket while simultaneously
preventing metal-induced misfolding.
To complement the remetallation assays of Fig. 2B,
we used the optical properties of ZMC1 to observe the

a small amount of misfolding. D, quantification of Zn2+ transferred from ZMC1 to apo DBDs. The stoichiometries are 1.0 ± 0.1 equivalents

binding to the R175H DBD (Lane 5). The protein-DNA complex is specific because the unlabeled DNA competes for binding (Lane 10).

the decline in apoptosis was due to exceeding the optimal
ZMC1:Zn2+ ratio. In support of this hypothesis, adding 25
µM ZnCl2 to the culture media restored growth inhibition
and exceeded the inhibition seen in the 1-2 µM ZMC1
doses. We conclude the ZMC1:Zn2+ stoichiometric
relationship is relevant to ZMC1 pharmacodynamics in
cells.
Given the two-site binding model for zinc in R175H
DBD (Fig. 1D), we predicted that R175H DBD could be
converted to its functional zinc-bound form in the absence
of ZMC1 if the concentration of free zinc was increased
to greater than the Kd of the native site (Kd1) but less than
the Kd of the non-native site (Kd2). We tested this using
EMSA in which we could fine-tune the concentration of
free zinc (Fig. 2H). We incubated R175H apoDBD with
concentrations of ZnCl2 from Kd1 (2 nM) to Kd2 (>1 µM).
We observed a shift at 20 nM ZnCl2, consistent with
saturation of the native zinc binding pocket. The shifted
band remained approximately constant up to 1.6 µM
ZnCl2 then disappeared at 10 µM ZnCl2, likely because
Zn2+ bound to the non-native sites and induced misfolding.
Site-specific binding can then be restored to the sample
containing 10 μM ZnCl2 if ZMC1 is added (Fig. 2G, Lane
9). These results validate our estimations for both Kd1 and
Kd2 of R175H DBD made in Figure 1D. Furthermore, they
indicate that remetallation of R175H does not require a
zinc metallochaperone such as ZMC1, if the concentration
of free zinc can be tightly controlled.

is with ZMC1, indicating that ZMC1 is a more effective
metallochaperone. As predicted by Fig. 2B, EDTA (20-300
µM) and ZnCl2 did not restore DNA binding activity by
EMSA (Supplementary Fig. S5).
We then determined if NTA could restore WT
conformation of R175H using cell-based assays. We
incubated TOV112D cells with either ZMC1 or NTA and
performed immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments with the
antibody PAB240, which specifically recognizes misfolded
and unfolded p53. Both ZMC1 and NTA substantially
reduced the amount of misfolded R175H relative to the
control (loss of 52 % and 35% respectively) (Fig. 3D).
Thus, both molecules induced a WT conformational
change in p53-R175H, with ZMC1 being more effective
than NTA in agreement with the EMSA experiments.
We substantiated these results by IF assays in
TOV112D cells using both the native specific (PAB1620)
and misfolded/unfolded specific (PAB240) antibodies. We
previously demonstrated that the immunophenotype of
the TOV112D cells is 1620-/240+ and that treatment with
ZMC1 reverses this phenotype to 1620+/240-, indicating
restoration of WT structure [8]. Both ZMC1 and NTA
induced a reversal of the TOV112D immunophenotype to
1620+/240-, but EDTA did not (Fig. 3E). Taken together,
our findings suggest that the zinc metallochaperone
activity of ZMC1 is shared by other zinc-binding
molecules with similar affinities for zinc.

Remetallation activity is not unique to ZMC1

The ZMC1 zinc metallochaperone mechanism
applies to other p53 missense mutants with
impaired zinc binding

If ZMC1 can function as a zinc metallochaperone
without interacting with p53, we reasoned its function
would be shared by other compounds with similar zinc
binding affinity. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated
NTA, which binds zinc with a similar affinity to ZMC1
(Kd = 1.7 x 10-8 M), but is structurally unrelated (Fig. 3A).
We incubated R175H and WT apoDBDs (30 µM) with
60 µM ZnCl2 and 180 µM NTA and measured their zinc
contents by PAR assay. NTA was nearly as effective as
ZMC1 in remetallating these proteins (Fig. 2B). However,
a small amount of misfolding was noted in the samples
remetallated with NTA suggesting that NTA does not
protect against misfoldingas well as ZMC1 (Fig. 2C). We
also tested NTA’s ability to rescue DBD from zinc-arrested
misfolding. NTA was able to rescue both WT and R175H
DBD, but it required higher concentrations and was less
effective compared to ZMC1 (Fig. 3C).
We next used EMSA to evaluate whether NTA
can activate R175H apoDBD functionally. NTA alone
(20-40 µM) did not restore DNA binding to R175H
apoDBD, but did when combined with ZnCl2. NTA also
exhibited the same stoichiometric relationship as ZMC1
in that a shift in DNA was seen for NTA:Zn2+ ratios of
2:1, 3:1 and 4:1, but was lost at 5:1 (Fig.3B). However,
the bound oligonucleotide band is less pronounced than it

To investigate if ZMC1 can restore function to
other p53 mutants with impaired zinc affinity, we tested
the ability of ZMC1 to induce apoptosis in cell lines
expressing mutations of the three zinc-binding Cys
residues: C238, C242, and C176. H2122 and SK-PN-DW
cells (p53-C176F) and LN-18 cells (p53-C238S) shared a
similar sensitivity to ZMC1 (IC50 of 0.4-0.7μM compared
to 0.37 µM for p53-R175H cells) (Fig. 4A). ZMC1 had
less effect on MCF7 (p53-WT) and SKOV3 (p53-null)
cells. H841 (C242S) and H1755 (C242F) cells were
markedly more sensitive to ZMC1 (IC50 of 7.9 nM and 51
nM, respectively). To determine whether growth inhibition
involves mechanisms other than p53 reactivation, we
repeated these growth inhibition studies in the presence
of an siRNA knockdown of mutant p53 in H841cells
(Supplementary Fig. S6). This knockdown markedly
attenuated the sensitivity of the cells to ZMC1 (IC50 = 22
nM) from 0.5 nM), but did not completely abrogate the
effect, indicating a component of cell growth inhibition
that was p53 independent as has been previously shown
[8].

misfolded conformation that is recognized by the
antibody PAB240. We next performed IF using the
PAB1620/240antibodies on the above cell lines
treated with ZMC1. ZMC1 treatment reversed the
immunophenotype of p53 protein from 1620-/240+ to
1620+/240-, indicating that ZMC1 induces a WT-like
conformational change in the C238S, C242F and C176F
mutants (Fig. 4B). We also found in IP, ZMC1 reduced
binding of PAB240 by 70% in H841 cells (Supplementary

Fig. S6).
We then evaluated the restoration of p53
transcriptional activity by ZMC1 in C238S, C242F and
C176F mutants by quantitating gene expression of p53
targets p21 and PUMA. Similar to its effect on p53-R175H
cells, ZMC1 potently induced p21 and PUMA in these

mediated degradation [8]. Measuring p53 protein levels
in ZMC1-treated cells is therefore a functional assay for
p53 reactivation. ZMC1 treatment of p53-C238S, C242F,
C176F cells resulted in a decline in p53 protein levels
relative to the untreated control (Fig. 4D), supporting the
conclusion that ZMC1 reactivates mutants of the three Cys
involved in coordinating zinc.
We hypothesized that, like R175H, other mutants
within the L2 or L3 loops of p53 may exhibit reduced zinc

affinity and therefore be candidates for ZMC1 rescue. The
X-ray crystal structure of WT DBD was recently solved to
2.05 Å resolution in the absence of DNA[18]. The authors
concluded that no other amino acid besides the WT residue
(Gly) could be substituted at position G245 without
distorting the zinc binding site. Thus, we hypothesized that
the G245S mutant might also be reactivated by ZMC1.
We found that G245S sensitivity to ZMC1 mirrored
that of R175H and other zinc-binding mutants in cell

growth inhibition assays (Fig. 4A). ZMC1 reversed the
immunophenotype from 1620-/240+ to 1620+/240shown by IF (Fig. 4B). Similar to the R175H mutant, we
detected increased gene expression levels of p21, as well
as decreased levels of the mutant protein upon ZMC1
treatment (Fig. 4C and D). We therefore conclude that
not only is the G245S mutant reactivated by ZMC1, but it
can also be classified as one with impaired zinc binding.
Alternatively, we examined another conformational
mutant (R249M) that is recognized by PAB240 and
did not find that this mutant was reactivated by ZMC1
(Supplementary Fig. S7). Thus we would conclude that
the R249M conformational mutant likely does not have
impaired zinc binding and that ZMC1 does not reactivate
all conformational p53 missense mutants.

WT conformation (1620+/240-) detected by IF (Fig. 5D).
Thus NAC does not inhibit ZMC1 mediated apoptosis
by interfering with the WT conformation change.
However, NAC potently inhibited the ZMC1 mediated
transcriptional upregulation of both p21 and PUMA at 6
and 24 hours (Fig. 5E).
To determine if this inhibition was mediated by
PTMs of the mutant p53, we examined the effects of
ZMC1 alone and in combination with NAC on ATM
activation and the phosphorylation status of serines 15
and 46 of p53 in p53-R175H mutant cells. Using a 24hour time course western blot, we observed that ZMC1
treatment caused an activation of ATM that occurred
within one hour after initiation of treatment and was
sustained (Fig. 5F). This ATM activation is likely due to
DNA damage as we also detected an increase in γ-H2AX
levels by ZMC1 in H1299 cells that express either WT or
R175H mutant p53 (Supplementary Fig. S8). ZMC1 also
induced p53 phosphorylation at serines 15 and 46 (Fig.
5F). Note that mutant p53 levels decreased over time and
then increased again with concomitant induction of p21
protein indicating reactivation of the mutant p53-R175H as
had been previously shown (Fig. 5F) [8]. When NAC was
included we found the following: 1) abrogation of ATM
activation, 2) decrease in phosphorylation on serines 15
and 46 of mutant p53, 3) loss of p21 induction and 4) restabilization of mutant p53 levels (Fig. 5F). These results
indicate that ZMC1 not only has a role in inducing a WT
conformation of mutant p53, but that it also functions
to transactivate the newly conformed mutant protein
via PTMs indicative of WT p53. Acetylation of lysine
at codon 120 has been shown to drive the p53 apoptotic
response, which is the dominant cellular phenotype of
ZMC1 treatment [21]. Indeed, treatment with ZMC1
induced K120 acetylation in p53-R175H mutant cells (Fig.
5G).

ZMC1 transactivates the newly conformed
mutant: a distinct component to the ZMC1
mechanism required for apoptotic function
We previously demonstrated that cellular glutathione
levels were significantly reduced by ZMC1 indicating
that ZMC1 affects the redox state of the cell [8]. We
also demonstrated that the apoptotic function of ZMC1
could be inhibited by the co-administration of a reducing
agent such as N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) [8]. It is known
that in response to cellular stress, p53 function is in part,
mediated through post-translational modifications (PTMs)
[19].
We hypothesized that the ZMC1-induced redox
stress functions to transactivate the newly restored
mutant. To investigate this we first sought to confirm that
the inhibitory activity of NAC on the apoptotic function
of ZMC1 was mediated by an anti-oxidant function and
not an alternate mechanism of NAC. Addition of another
known anti-oxidant, glutathione (2 mM), significantly
attenuated ZMC1 induced apoptosis (Fig. 5A). To
confirm that ZMC1 induces ROS in cells, we performed
IF on ZMC1 treated cells using an antibody that detects
oxidized DNA (8-oxy-dGuo) on human tumor cell lines
with different p53 status. We found that ZMC1 increased
the 8-oxy-dGuo staining in both the p53-R175H and the
H1299 (p53-null) cells at 6 and 24 hours (Fig. 5B). In
addition, we found that ZMC1 treatment of p53-R175H
cells significantly induced gene expression of the antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2 and several of its
downstream targets (GCLM, GCLC, GGT1, NQO1, and
HMOX1). Note that this induction could be abrogated by
concomitant treatment with NAC (Fig. 5C).
We explored what role increased ROS levels play
in the ZMC1 mechanism. It is possible that the ROS
levels could be involved in the WT conformation change
in p53-R175H cells as redox changes have been shown
to induce conformation changes in WT p53 [20]. In the
presence of NAC and ZMC1, the p53-R175H retained the

DISCUSSION
Our model for zinc-induced folding/misfolding and
rescue by ZMC1 is shown in Fig. 6A. The model posits
two types of zinc ligation sites on p53: native (Kd1) and
non-native (Kd2) (Fig. 6A1). It is likely that multiple nonnative sites exist, given that DBD contains 10 Cys and
9 His. PAR competition assays estimate Kd2≥ 10−6 Μ for
R175H (Fig. 1D) and we assume it to be the same for
WT. Kd1 of WT is too low to be measured by PAR but
it was previously estimated to be less than 10-10 M [11].
For WT p53 to be functional in the cell Kd1 must be in the
pM range as the intracellular concentration of free zinc
is typically maintained on the order of 10-10-10-12 M [17].
Thus, at physiological zinc concentrations, Kd1 and Kd2 of
WT p53 are tuned for zinc binding to the correct site and
not to the incorrect sites, and thus WT p53 is in its zincbound (holo) form (Fig. 6A2).
The situation is different for R175H. Its Kd1 of

2 nM is 10 – 1000-fold higher than physiological zinc
concentrations. R175H is therefore likely in the apo form
in the cell (Fig. 6A2). Raising intracellular zinc above 2
nM can in principle reactivate R175H for DNA binding
(Fig. 2G), but if levels rise beyond ~1 µM then R175H
is expected to misfold due to non-native site zinc binding
(Kd2) (Figure 6A3). Thus at high concentrations of zinc
(>1 µM) both WT and R175H mutant p53 are expected
to be inactive as they would rapidly misfold (Fig. 6A3).
Metallochaperones such as ZMC1 and NTA are
effective because they bind zinc less tightly than the native
site and more tightly than the non-native sites. Indeed,
their Kd values of 30 nM and 17 nM, respectively, lie inbetween Kd1 and Kd2 of R175H DBD (Fig. 6A4). In this
way, intracellular zinc concentrations can be buffered at

levels optimal for restoring WT conformation to R175H.
By contrast, EDTA and A6 possess Kd values less than Kd1
and greater than Kd2, respectively, and therefore are unable
to function as metallochaperones.
In order for ZMC1 to rescue mutant p53 function
in vivo, our model implicitly assumes that the drug
increases the concentration of free Zn2+ in cells. It is
possible that ZMC1 mobilizes intracellular stores of
zinc from endogenous zinc-binding proteins such as
metallothioneins. However, we regard it as more likely
that additional zinc comes from sources outside the cell,
including circulating serum which contains 8.5 – 23.6 µM
Zn2+ as supplemental zinc increases the apoptotic function
of ZMC1 [22]. It may prove beneficial to co-administer a
zinc metallochaperone with supplemental zinc in patients.

Figure 6: Dual mechanism of ZMC1. A1, in the absence of zinc both WT and R175H DBD are in the their zinc free (apo) forms.

The Kd1 of WT p53 is << Kd1 of R175H p53 (≈2 nM). The Kd2 of both WT and R175H p53 are ≥ 1 µM. A2, at physiologic concentrations
of zinc, WT p53 is zinc bound (holo) (Kd1<[Zn2+]<Kd2). The R175H p53 is in its apo form ([Zn2+]<Kd1<Kd2). A3, in high concentrations
of zinc, both WT p53 and R175H p53 are misfolded (Kd1<Kd2<[Zn2+]). A4, in the presence of ZMC1 both WT and R175H p53 are in their
holo form despite (Kd1<Kd2<[Zn2+]). B, once the WT conformation change has occurred the increase in ROS by ZMC1 induces N-terminal
post-translational modifications of mutant p53 (ser-15, 46, lys-120) that transactivate mutant p53 and induce an apoptotic program.

The zinc-independent mechanism of ZMC1 pertains
to the role of ROS. ZMC1 treatment elevates ROS levels,
likely through iron chelation and Fenton chemistry as has
been observed for other thiosemicarbazones [9]. These
changes produce a stress response manifested by the
activation of kinases such as ATM, resulting in PTMs of
the mutant p53 N-terminus. These phosphorylation and
acetylation events transactivate the protein and induce an
apoptotic program making the drug therapeutic as a single
agent (Fig. 6B).
The ROS signal that activates the newly conformed
p53-R175H would presumably also be present in noncancer cells and thus potentially activate WT p53. We did
not find that ZMC1 increased p53 or p21 levels in several
human tumor cell lines with WT p53 as was observed with
the cytotoxic drug etoposide[8]. One reason this effect was
observed in p53-R175H mutant cells may be that p53R175H levels are much higher than that of WT p53 (which
is relatively undetectable by western blot). Another may
be that WT p53 cells are able to compensate for changes in
ROS levels due to the anti-oxidant properties of p53 [23].
Our results indicate that ZMC1 activates mutant
p53 by restoring proper zinc loading, rather than by
conventional binding of drug to protein and altering its
function/conformation. There are four lines of evidence
for this conclusion. First, we did not detect a ZMC1-DBD
interaction by equilibrium dialysis. Second, ZMC1 activity
was reduced when the ZMC1:ZnCl2 ratio exceeded 5:1.
If ZMC1 bound to p53 (either as the zinc-free or zincbound drug), increasing concentrations of ZMC1 would
be predicted to increase its activity, not diminish it. Third,
A6, which is structurally similar to ZMC1 but binds Zn2+
at least 100-fold weaker, fails to activate R175H p53.
Lastly, NTA, acompound structurally unrelated to ZMC1
but with similar zinc affinity, also demonstrates zinc
metallochaperone activity.
Evidence that mutant p53 could be reactivated by
the addition of exogenous zinc was introduced by Puca et
al. in which both the p53-R175H and p53-R273H mutants
were reactivated by zinc supplementation [24]. Recently
this group reported that a fluorescent zinc-curcumin
complex could also reactivate the p53-R175H and R273H
mutants; however the mechanism of this is not known
[25]. It is unclear how p53-R273H can be reactivated
by zinc as this is a DNA contact mutant which should
not be able to bind DNA regardless of its zinc status.
Nonetheless, our results provide the first evidence that
WT structure/function can be restored to mutant p53 by
a zinc metallochaperone. Pharmacologically, the strategy
of delivering zinc by a small-molecule is preferable over
administering exogenous zinc as our experiments indicate
that the range of concentrations of free zinc required to
remetallate the p53-R175H is quite narrow, and free
zinc concentrations outside of this window quickly lead
to misfolding. A zinc metallochaperone prevents this
problem by serving as a zinc buffer.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Intriguingly, Puca et al. found that zinc
supplementation was inadequate for p53 mediated tumor
cell apoptosis, but rather it was necessary to co-administer
a cytotoxic agent such as Adriamycin along with zinc to
see mutant p53 induced cell death. These findings are
consistent with our observations in that both restoration of
WT structure and a transactivation signal are required. We
observed both of these effects in ZMC1,which explains
why the drug can be therapeutic as a single agent.
The broadening of the allele specificity of ZMC1 has
important implications for drug development as it greatly
increases the potential pool of patients that might benefit
from synthetic zinc metallochaperones. The G245S mutant
is the fifth most common p53 missense mutant accounting
for 2.8% of p53 missense mutants [26]. When accounting
for all of the known mutants with impaired zinc binding,
we estimate this pool to be greater than 70,000 patients in
the United States annually. Given that the G245S was not
previously known to have impaired zinc binding, it also
questions how many other conformational mutants share
a similar defect. Thus the potential pool might be larger.
In conclusion, these findings illuminate a new path
from which to drug mutant p53 using a small molecule
acting as a zinc metallochaperone. From a broader
perspective, the use of a compound to deliver a metal ion
to correct a defect in protein folding is a novel mechanism
for a small molecule therapeutic. Future studies will be
necessary to illuminate the properties of a particular
chelator that make it a good zinc metallochaperone. Our
data indicate that one of these properties is its affinity for
zinc. We speculate that both the zinc-metallochaperone
and redox properties can be optimized through medicinal
chemistry. This study also identifies the potential pool of
patients that will most likely benefit from such a drug,
which is a vital component to the successful development
of any targeted molecular therapeutic. Our understanding
of mutant p53 biology has grown considerably in recent
years and we have come to appreciate that not all missense
mutants are equivalent [26]. Our research here provides
a practical need to discriminate these mutants in the
application of mutant p53 based cancer therapeutics.
