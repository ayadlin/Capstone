BACKGROUND. The objective of this study was to compare the prognostic relevance of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) versus Choi criteria for the assessment of response in patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities or trunk
wall who received preoperative chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy in a phase 3 trial. METHODS. Patients received 3 cycles of
preoperative epirubicin þ ifosfamide with or without radiotherapy. The diagnostic concordance between RECIST and Choi criteria and
their correlation with overall survival (OS) and freedom from progression (FFP) were evaluated in a univariate Cox regression model.
RESULTS. In 243 of 321 eligible patients, RECIST, Choi criteria, and histology were predictive for OS and FFP. In the subgroup of
69 patients who received chemotherapy alone and were evaluable by both RECIST and Choi criteria, Choi criteria were associated
significantly with OS and FFP, whereas RECIST predicted only FFP, and the pattern of agreement observed between the 2 criteria
was unsatisfactory. On a dichotomous scale, comparing objective response (complete and partial responses) and lack of
response (stable and progressive disease) to preoperative chemotherapy according to RECIST and Choi criteria, only Choi criteria
were predictive of OS and FFP, and fair agreement between RECIST and Choi criteria was observed. When lack of progression and
progression were compared (complete and partial responses þ stable disease vs progressive disease), both assessment criteria were
significantly predictive of OS and FFP, and there was substantial agreement between the 2 criteria. CONCLUSIONS. Response to
chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy was associated with a better outcome in patients with high-risk soft tissue sarcoma. Choi
criteria were better predictors than RECIST in patients who received preoperative chemotherapy alone. Cancer 2012;118:5857-66.

INTRODUCTION
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) are based on tumor size.1,2 This is an added value in terms of
their reliability (reproducibility), because size is relatively easy to measure. However, the introduction of molecular-targeted therapies has emphasized the limitations of RECIST in terms of their validity, because tumor response may be nondimensional, especially in an early phase.3-21 In these patients, tumor response is marked by changes in the tumor
radiologic aspect and in its functional imaging.
Attempts to establish new response criteria have been undertaken. Choi criteria were conceived to assess tumor
response in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors who received treatment with imatinib, and the criteria
were evaluated by computed tomography (CT) scans and were validated based on progression-free survival (PFS).22,23 It
is noteworthy that pathologic responses without any decrease in size were reported even in patients with solid tumors who
received cytotoxic chemotherapy. Patients with myxoid liposarcoma who received trabectedin24,25 and patients with osteosarcoma who received chemotherapy26-28 are examples among sarcomas.

We previously demonstrated that Choi criteria
adapted to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlated
better with pathologic tumor response than RECIST in a
series of 38 patients with high-grade soft tissue sarcomas
who received preoperative chemotherapy with or without
radiation therapy within a prospective phase 3 Italian Sarcoma Group/Spanish Sarcoma Group trial.29 The results
of the trial recently were reported.30 Herein, we evaluate a
comparison between RECIST and Choi criteria in eligible
patients and correlate response to overall survival (OS)
and freedom from progression (FFP).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From January 2002 and March 2007, a prospective,
randomized study of preoperative chemoradiation therapy for localized, high-risk (high grade, deep, 5 cm in
greatest dimension) soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities
and trunk wall enrolled 321 eligible patients in Italy (10
sites) and Spain (9 sites).29 In this retrospective analysis,
we included all patients who entered the study with measurable disease and completed the study protocol treatment; these patients were evaluated before and after
treatment by MRI or CT. The current study was conducted on a total of 256 patients, including 143 patients
who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy and 113 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant radiotherapy. Among the last group
of 113 patients treated preoperatively only with chemotherapy, we selected the subgroup of patients who were
fully evaluable for both RECIST (version 1)1 and Choi
criteria.22 Table 1 reports the frequency distribution of
RECIST, Choi criteria, and histology for the whole series
of 256 patients as well as in the 113 patients who received
only preoperative chemotherapy. Institutional review
boards at each institution approved the trial, and signed
informed consent was obtained for all patients.
Patients received 3 cycles of epirubicin 120 mg/m2
plus ifosfamide 9000 mg/m2. Then, they underwent surgery within 4 to 6 weeks after the end of chemotherapy.
Radiologic response was evaluated according to RECIST
(version 1)1 and Choi criteria22 and was centrally reviewed.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Computed
Tomography Techniques

Before surgery, MRI or CT studies were obtained at baseline
and after chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. The
scans were collected from every center, and the images were
centrally reviewed at Istituto Nazionale Tumori (Milano,
Italy), by 2 expert sarcoma radiologists (A.M. for MRI,
C.M. for CT) who were blinded to patient outcomes.

Criteria based on Choi H, Charnsangavej C, Faria SC, at al. Correlation of
computed tomography and positron emission tomography in patients with
metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor treated at a single institution with
imatinib mesylate: proposal of new computed tomography response criteria. J Clin Oncol. 2007;25:1753-1759.22

Only patients who were studied using the same technique (MRI or CT) before and after treatment and whose
radiologic studies were available on a Digital Imaging and
Communications in Medicine (DICOM) file and loaded
into a multimodality work place (ie, Picture Archiving and
Communication System [PACS]; Syngo [Siemens Medical
Solutions, New York, NY]; Leonardo [Siemens Medical
Solutions]) at Istituto Nazionale Tumori were considered
eligible for response evaluation by Choi criteria. The
images had to be available in portal venous phase for CT
scans (slice thickness 5 mm). For MRI, turbo-spin-echo
(TSE) T2-weighted images and TSE T1-weighted images
(slice thickness, 5 mm) followed by a contrast-enhanced
TSE T1-weighted image were requested.
To evaluate MRIs, contrast-enhanced TSE T1weighted images were evaluated before and after digital
subtraction (by A.M.). All data sets were evaluated both
qualitatively and semiquantitatively. The percentage of
contrast enhancement was assessed as follows: on subtracted, contrast-enhanced, T1-weighted sequences, the
radiologist (A.M.) measured the contrast enhancement of
the tumor by manually drawing a region of interest around
the margin of the whole lesion on sections taken every

5 mm, thus encompassing the entire tumor mass. Muscle
was used as the reference tissue. The contrast enhancement
measurements from all sections were added, and the average contrast enhancement for each lesion was calculated.
To evaluate CT scans, the radiologist (C.M.) measured CT attenuation values of the tumor lesion in Hounsfield units on CT images that were obtained during the
portal venous phase. Two-dimensional regions of interest
that included the entire lesion were drawn, and all axial
slices encompassing the lesion were included. To accurately define the lesion, the radiologist manually edited
the contours of the regions of interest on each axial slice.
The volume of interest covering the whole lesion was
defined as the sum of all 2-dimensional regions of interest.
Both cystic and necrotic areas were included. The software
semiquantitatively calculated the mean tumor density (in
Hounsfield units), which was defined as the average of all
pixels enclosed in the volume of interest.
The 2 radiologists retrospectively reviewed all MRI
and CT images. The percentage of change in mean tumor
density/contrast enhancement before and after treatment
was computed for each lesion.
Tumor response was evaluated using RECIST and
Choi criteria according to criteria defined for gastrointestinal
stromal tumors and adapted to MRI.1,22,28 We applied Choi
criteria to MRI, assuming that changes in contrast enhancement on subtracted, contrast enhanced, T1-weighted sequences would parallel the changes in density on CT scans,
because both are markers of tumor vascularization. According to Choi criteria, a partial response (PR) was defined as a
decrease 10% in tumor size or a decrease 15% in tumor
density/contrast enhancement on CT/MRI studies; progression was defined as new lesions, an increase 10% in tumor
size without meeting any criteria for a PR according to tumor density/contrast enhancement, or an increase 15% in
tumor density/contrast enhancement.
Pathology Assessment

A retrospective, centralized pathologic review of pretreatment material was performed by a panel of Italian Sarcoma
Group/Spanish Sarcoma Group pathologists with expertise
in sarcoma to confirm diagnoses and histologic grading. A
pathology review using World Health Organization criteria31 was carried out in 222 patients (71%). In the remaining
89 patients, the diagnosis made at the referral center was considered. For statistical analyses, patients were divided into 4
groups: undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (formerly
malignant fibrous histiocytoma) and spindle cell sarcoma
not otherwise specified (Group 1), leiomyosarcoma (Group
2), synovial sarcoma (Group 3), and other (Group 4).

Statistical Analysis

In addition to the whole series of patients, we focused on
the group of patients who received preoperative chemotherapy alone and were evaluable by both RECIST and
Choi criteria. Responses according to RECIST and Choi
criteria were investigated in terms of diagnostic concordance as well as the prognostic capability of their original
ordinal measurement scale (3 categories). Subsequently,
because of the small number of patients in this subgroup,
RECIST and Choi criteria variables were dichotomized
according to 2 different criteria and were investigated in
terms of concordance and prognosis.
Concordance between dichotomous and ordinal variables was assessed by computing (unweighted) Cohen
kappa statistics (j) and weighed kappa statistics (jw),
respectively.32 The kappa statistics (both unweighted and
weighed) usually lie between 0 (absence of agreement) and
1 (absolute agreement), and negative values may be
obtained for situations in which actual agreement is less
than chance. Thus, as previously reported33 jw values
were considered satisfactory if they were equal to or greater
than 0.80, whereas values of j were interpreted in a qualitative manner based on the report by Landis and Koch.34
To assess the association between the various
response criteria and histology and clinical outcomes,
we performed a survival analysis in terms of both OS
and FFP, which we defined as the time elapsed from
randomization to death and to the first evidence of recurrence, respectively. The patterns of OS and FFP
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.35 The
prognostic role of each variable (univariate analysis) on
OS and FFP was investigated using a Cox regression
model.36 In this model, each regression coefficient represents the logarithm of the hazard ratio, which is
assumed to be constant over time. Under the null hypothesis that a variable has no prognostic role on OS
and FFP, the hazard ratio is expected to be 1.00. The
hypothesis of a hazard ratio of 1.00 was tested using the
Wald statistic. In the Cox regression model, histologic
subtype was categorized in 4 dummy variables using undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma/spindle cell sarcoma
not otherwise specified as the reference category. When
RECIST and Choi criteria were considered on their
original scale, 2 dummy variables were generated by
using the putative better prognosis category (ie, PR) as
the reference category.
The risk of local and distant recurrence after surgery
was assessed using a competing risks approach.37 All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

In total, 243 of 256 patients who were included in
this study were evaluable for response (13 were missing
radiologic data). Fifty-five were evaluated by CT, and 188
were evaluated by MRI.

At a median follow-up of 62 months (range, 28105 months), the probability of OS (Fig. 2A) and FFP
for the overall series was 0.65 (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.58-0.71) and 0.54 (95% CI, 0.47-0.60),
respectively. Recurrent disease developed in 114
patients, whereas 88 patients died after randomization.
Among the 114 patients who relapsed after randomization, 17 developed a local recurrence, whereas 97 had
distant metastases as the primary event either alone or

Prognostic Value of RECIST, Choi Criteria, and
Histology
Overall series of patients

In the univariate Cox analysis, with PR used as the
reference category (Table 3), RECIST did not have any
prognostic role in OS (Fig. 3B); and, for FFP, only the progressive disease (PD) category was associated significantly
with outcome compared with the PR category. With Choi
criteria, the considered comparisons (PD vs PR and stable
disease [SD] vs PR) were associated significantly with OS
(Fig. 3C). Conversely, only the comparison between PD
and PR resulted significantly associated with FFP. Histology did not appear to be associated with the 2 considered
clinical outcomes in this subset of patients (Fig. 3D).
RECIST and Choi Criteria on Dichotomous Scale

In evaluating RECIST and Choi criteria variables
on a dichotomous scale, we compared responses to preoperative chemotherapy (ie, a PR according to RECIST and
Choi criteria) with a lack of response (ie, SD þ PD
according to RECIST and Choi criteria) and observed fair
agreement between the 2 diagnostic criteria with a j statistic of 0.22 (95% CI, 0.10-0.34). Furthermore, when these
5862

variables were considered based on complementary
dichotomization, that is, with versus without PD (ie, PR
þ SD vs PD according to RECIST and Choi criteria), we
observed substantial agreement between the 2 diagnostic
criteria with a j statistic of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.16-1.00).
The prognostic role of both RECIST and Choi criteria also was explored by considering the 2 types of
dichotomization mentioned above. For Choi criteria,
both dichotomizations were significantly predictive for
OS and FFP in the univariate Cox model; whereas, for
RECIST, only the variable dichotomized as PR þ SD versus PD was associated significantly with both clinical outcomes (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In this study on neoadjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk
soft tissue sarcoma (with or without preoperative radiotherapy and with or without 2 additional cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy), tumor response to preoperative
chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy was associated with a better outcome. However, Choi criteria,
extended to MRI, exhibited a better prognostic role than
RECIST (Table 2). In fact, the outcome of patients who
had SD according to RECIST was identical to the outcome of patients who had a PR. Conversely, in the subgroup of 69 patients who received preoperative
chemotherapy alone and were evaluable by both RECIST
and Choi criteria, Choi criteria were better

prognosticators than RECIST (Table 3), with most
patients who had SD according to RECIST (72%) were
classified with PRs according to Choi criteria; furthermore in 2 patients, PD according to RECIST was classified as a PR according to Choi criteria. A trend toward a
better outcomes was observed in patients who had a PR
according to RECIST compared with those who had
PD; however, paradoxically, those who had SD according to RECIST fared better than those who had a PR.
Conversely, patients who had a PR according to Choi
criteria had a trend toward better survival compared with
patients who had PD and SD. The comparison between
response to preoperative chemotherapy (ie, complete
response þ PR, according to both RECIST and Choi
criteria) and lack of response (ie, RECIST/Choi criteria
SD þ PD) indicated that responders according to Choi
Cancer

December 1, 2012

criteria had better outcomes than nonresponders,
whereas responses according to RECIST were not correlated significantly either with OS or FFP compared with
nonresponses. Conversely, lack of progression (CR þ PR
þ SD) according to RECIST was correlated with better
outcomes compared with PD according to RECIST,
similar to what was observed with Choi criteria. In brief,
several patients with SD according to RECIST had a PR
according to Choi criteria, and this correlated favorably
with the outcome. Overall, histology had a significant
prognostic role for both OS and FFP: undifferentiated
pleomorphic sarcoma was the histotype with the most
favorable outcome, and leiomyosarcoma had the worst.
Consistently, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma had
a higher response rate than leiomyosarcoma according to
Choi criteria.

This analysis has some limitations. First, it is an
unplanned subgroup analysis. Second, the number of
patients was small, because they had to be evaluable by
both RECIST and Choi criteria, and those who also
received preoperative radiotherapy are at least less meaningful, because the local effect of radiation therapy does
not necessarily have any major systemic impact. The main
limitation is that this trial did not have a control arm of
patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy. Therefore,
it cannot settle the long-lasting issue of the efficacy of adjuvant therapy in soft tissue sarcoma.38-41 If the efficacy were
nil, then there could not be any correlation in principle
between the tumor response and the outcome. Conversely,
detecting some correlations, as we did, does not mean that
adjuvant chemotherapy is effective (because of the potential selection bias, which theoretically could lead independently to both a tumor response and a better outcome).
We previously demonstrated that Choi criteria were
better predictors of pathologic response than RECIST in a
subgroup of patients who were treated on this study.28 At
the time, we still lacked data on patient outcomes. Currently, although we have data only in a limited number of
patients, we can state that Choi criteria also are better than
RECIST in predicting survival. Unfortunately, we could
not study pathologic responses in all patients because of differences in tumor sampling between participating centers.

In the current study, we made an effort to refine the
way we assess nondimensional responses. Choi criteria are
complex for use in daily routine practice, because they
require postprocessing assessment by dedicated software
with the help of a radiologist in the segmentation of
lesions. In addition, they allow for only semiquantitative
evaluation. Thus, perfusion and diffusion MRI and CT
studies, dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound studies,
and PET scans also are planned in our new ongoing trial
to better describe tumor tissue changes and for the evaluation of quantitative parameters and radiologic-pathologic
correlations.
In our series, patients with SD according to RECIST
fared better than those who had a PR according to
RECIST. It is noteworthy that most SD according to
RECIST corresponded to a PR according to Choi criteria.
This indicates that nondimensional, or minor, responses
brought about a better outcome than dimensional
responses, which we also were able to confirm by combining RECIST and Choi criteria. This is intriguing,
although the small number of patients, of course, is a limiting factor for any further speculation. However, the
patients received 3 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy;
thus, major responses actually are fast responses, and they
may correspond to the most aggressive tumors. In these
patients, chemotherapy may have exerted a limited prognostic impact overall. The value of such a hypothesis will
require further assessment.
It is noteworthy that, in terms of the shortcomings
of tumor response with targeted agents, PFS often is advocated as a suitable indicator of antitumor activity. However, in our series of 166 patients, 7 patients who were
classified with PD according to RECIST had a PR according to Choi criteria, and 2 patients who were classified
with SD according to RECIST had PD according to Choi
criteria. In other words, using Choi criteria would result
in a different assessment of PD and, thus, would change
the estimated PFS.
In our study, patients with leiomyosarcoma fared
worse than patients who had other histotypes. This result
correlated with the responses defined according to Choi
criteria, in which leiomyosarcoma is the histotype with
the lowest percentage of responses and the highest progression rate. It is noteworthy that Choi criteria again
were better predictors than RECIST. These results suggest
that chemosensitivity may have an impact on patient outcomes, possibly in combination with the natural history
of each histotype. In particular, it is believed that leiomyosarcomas are less sensitive to ifosfamide if they are sensitive at all to this drug.

Tumor Response to Neoadjuvant CT in STS/Stacchiotti et al

In conclusion, currently, there is much discussion
about tumor response criteria in solid tumors. There is a
trend toward nondimensional criteria, especially when
molecularly targeted agents are used. Our current analysis
suggests that tumor response to chemotherapy may benefit from newer criteria. Further work is needed to refine
criteria for nondimensional assessment of tumor
responses.
