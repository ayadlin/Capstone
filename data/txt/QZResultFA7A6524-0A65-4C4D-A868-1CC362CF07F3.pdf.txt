ABSTRACT
The pathogenesis of the adrenocortical cancer (ACC) involves integration of
molecular signals and the interplay of different downstream pathways (i.e. IGFII/
IGF1R, β-catenin, Wnt, ESR1). This tumor is characterized by limited therapeutic
options and unsuccessful treatments. A useful strategy to develop an effective therapy
for ACC is to identify a common downstream target of these multiple pathways. A good
candidate could be the transcription factor estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα)
because of its ability to regulate energy metabolism, mitochondrial biogenesis and
signalings related to cancer progression.
In this study we tested the effect of ERRα inverse agonist, XCT790, on the
proliferation of H295R adrenocortical cancer cell line. Results from in vitro and
in vivo experiments showed that XCT790 reduced H295R cell growth. The inhibitory
effect was associated with impaired cell cycle progression which was not followed
by any apoptotic event. Instead, incomplete autophagy and cell death by a necrotic
processes, as a consequence of the cell energy failure, induced by pharmacological
reduction of ERRα was evidenced.
Our results indicate that therapeutic strategies targeting key factors such as
ERRα that control the activity and signaling of bioenergetics processes in highenergy demanding tumors could represent an innovative/alternative therapy for the
treatment of ACC.

Given the high mortality and aggressiveness of ACC, more
effective and specific treatment options are needed. Recently,
monoclonal antibodies targeting insulin-like growth factor II
(IGFII) receptor (IGF1R) have been tested in clinical trials,
however they provided a limited effectiveness in refractory
patients [3]. Rationale for targeting IGF1R comes from the
observation that IGFII gene is overexpressed in ACC [4]. We
have recently demonstrated that IGFII/IGF1R pathway can
be activated by the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), a gene
overexpressed in ACC that mediates estrogen-dependent
proliferative effects [5, 6]. ESR1 knock down was more
effective than an IGF1R antibody in reducing H295R cell

INTRODUCTION
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a very rare and
aggressive disease with a high risk of relapse after radical
surgery. Treatment options in advanced, metastatic stages
are limited, since cytotoxic chemotherapy options are poor
and radiotherapy is mostly ineffective [1]. The drug mitotane
(o, p′-dichlorodiphe nyldichloroethane (o, p′-DDD)) with its
adrenolytic activity is the only adrenal specific drug that
is currently used for ACC treatment. However, toxicity,
narrow therapeutic window and side effects are the major
limitation to its use as well as therapeutic success [2].

proliferation in vitro [5] and the selective estrogen receptor
modulator (SERM) tamoxifen prevented the growth of
H295R both in vitro [7] and as xenografts in vivo [5]. Thus,
ESR1 could be a promising target to reduce ACC growth.
Indeed, a recent study [8], investigating a large
cohort of advanced ACC, confirmed the presence of a
large number of potentially targetable molecules involved
in ACC progression. These observations confirm that
ACC is an extremely heterogeneous disease and that
its pathogenesis involves integration of signals and the
interplay of downstream pathways. It is currently accepted
that these changes are also associated with a profound
reprogramming of cellular metabolism [9]. Consequently,
one potential strategy to develop an effective therapy for
ACC could be the identification of a common downstream
target of multiple pathways capable of controlling
expression and activity of various bioenergetic factors.
Estrogen Related Receptor α (ERRα) is an orphan
member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of
transcription factors that has been identified on the basis
of its high level of sequence identity to ERα and for which
an endogenous ligand has yet to be defined [10]. ERRα
functions downstream of the peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha and beta
(PGC-1α and PGC-1β) and regulates the expression of
genes involved in energy metabolism and mitochondrial
biogenesis such as genes encoding enzymes and proteins
of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, pyruvate metabolism,
oxidative phosphorylation, and electron transport [11].
Research to understand how changes in cell metabolism
promote tumor growth has accelerated in recent years
[12]. As a consequence, research has focused on targeting
metabolic dependencies of cancer cells, an approach
with the potential to have a major impact on patient
care. Notably, ERRα has recently been associated with
dysregulated cell metabolism and cancer progression.
Accordingly, increased expression of ERRα has been
shown in several cancerous tissues including breast [13],
ovary [14] prostate [15] and colon [16]. Several signaling
pathways, also relevant to ACC development have been
shown to converge upon and regulate the expression and
activity of ERRα together with its coactivators such as
PGC-1α and β in others tumor types [17]. Several studies
have reported that ERRα inverse agonist XCT-790 [18]
can induce cell growth arrest in different tumor cell lines
[19, 20]. To date, few studies have investigated the role
of ERRα in adrenal gland and ACC. ERRα is expressed
in normal adult adrenal and regulates the expression of
enzymes involved in steroidogenesis [21]. Moreover,
ERRα seems to be more expressed in ACC compared to
normal adrenal and adenoma [22].
The aim of this study was to establish if ERRα
depletion using XCT790 can induce growth arrest in
ACC cells. The data obtained support the hypothesis that
ERRα could be a promising target for the treatment of
adrenocortical cancer.

ERRα inverse agonist XCT790 decreases
ERRα protein content and inhibits ACC cells
proliferation in vitro
First, we verified that ERRα is expressed in H295R
adrenocortical cancer cells. MCF-7 breast cancer cells
were used as positive control [23] (Figure 1A). Moreover,
we also demonstrated that in both H295R and MCF-7
cells, XCT790 treatment decreased ERRα protein levels
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1B). The latter results
confirmed the ability of XCT790 to reduce the expression
of ERRα most probably by proteasome degradation [23].
Next, we evaluated the effects of different concentrations
of ERRα inverse agonist XCT790 on ACC cell growth.
Results from MTT assay revealed that XCT790 treatment
exerted a dose- and time-dependent inhibition on H295R
cell proliferation compared to vehicle-treated cells
(Figure 1C). The maximum inhibitory effect on ACC cell
proliferation was seen at 10 μM XCT790 that was then
used for all the following experiments.

ERRα inverse agonist XCT790 inhibits ACC
cells proliferation in vivo
We next established H295R cell xenograft tumors
in immunocompromised mice to investigate the ability
of XCT790 to reduce tumor growth in vivo. To this aim,
H295R cells were injected into the intrascapular region
of mice. When tumors reached an average volume of
200 mm3, animals were randomized into two groups to
be treated with either vehicle or XCT790 (2,5 mg/Kg).
As shown in Figure 2A, mice treated with XCT790
displayed a significant tumor growth reduction compared
to the vehicle treated control group. Accordingly, tumor
reduction upon XCT790 treatment is evidenced both in
terms of tumor mass (Figure 2B) and proliferation as seen
in Figure 2C, showing a strong decrease in Ki67staining
(value score control: 7.2 ± 0,46 (SD); value score XCT790
treated cells: 4.7 ± 0.53* (SD), *p < 0.05).

ERRα inverse agonist XCT790 blocks G1/S
transition of ACC cells without inducing
apoptosis
The observed effects of XCT790 on ACC cells
proliferation led us to evaluate XCT790 action on H295R
cell cycle progression.
First, by analyzing PI staining with FACSJazz flow
cytometer, we investigated whether XCT790 treatment
could affect the distribution of cells within the three
major phases of the cycle. To this aim, H295R cells were
grown for 24 h in 5% CS-FBS and then treated with either
vehicle (DMSO) or 10 μM XCT790. 48 hours later, FACS
analysis revealed that XCT790 treated cells accumulated

cells

marker of apoptotic events, we next attempted to verify
the presence of apoptotic features such as PARP-1cleavage
and caspase 3/7 activation, all well-known biochemical
markers of programmed cell death. Surprisingly, results
from Western blotting analysis for PARP-1 (Figure 3D)
and caspase 3/7 activity assay (Figure 3E) clearly showed
that XCT790 did not activate an apoptotic pathway.

Very recent data revealed that low levels of CIC or
its impaired expression induce mitochondrial dysfunction
followed by enhanced mitochondrial turnover via
autophagy/mitophagy mechanism [27]. Based on this
observation and accordingly to our above reported
results showing the ability of XCT790 to down-regulate
CIC expression in H295R cells, we wanted to verify if
autophagic features were detected in our experimental
conditions. Autophagy is characterized by acidic vacu­
oles (AVO) formation, which can be measured by
acridine orange (AO) vital staining. AO moves freely to
cross biological membranes and accumulates in acidic
compartment, where it is seen as bright red fluorescence
[28]. As shown in Figure 6A (upper panel), AO vital
staining of 48 h XCT790-treated H295R cells showed the
accumulation of AVO in the cytoplasm. To quantify the
accumulation of the acidific component, we performed
FACS analysis of acridine orange-stained cells using FL3
mode (> 650 nm) to quantify the bright red fluorescence
and FL1 mode (500–550 nm) for the green fluorescence.
As shown in Figure 6A (lower panel), XCT790 treatment
raised the strength of red fluorescence from 7,5% to
51%. These results corroborate the observation that
XCT790, increases the formation of AVOs which suggests
autophagy/mitophagy as possible mechanisms to explain
the reduced mitochondrial mass. This latter event could
be responsible for the inhibitory effects on cell growth
elicited by XCT790 on adrenocortical cancer cells.
A careful evaluation of the autophagic/mitophagic process
by investigating changes in autophagic markers such as
Beclin 1, LC3B, BNIP3 and Cathepsin B (Figure  6B),
suggested that XCT790 treatment promotes the initial
stages of the autophagic process. This is supported by the
evidence of increased Beclin 1 expression and the presence
of the cleaved LC3B form [29]. However, autophagy fails
to terminate as indicated by decreased BNIP3, Cathepsin
B and Lamp1 proteins expression [29]. Therefore, we
evaluated XCT790 ability to induce H295R cells death
by necrosis. To this aim, Trypan blue exclusion test was
performed after 48 h of XCT790 treatment. As shown in
Figure 6C, H295R displayed a significant increase in the
number of positive stained cells compared to control cells
indicating that membrane integrity and permeability were
lost accounting for a necrotic event following a bionergetic
failure triggered by ERRα depletion.

XCT-790 decreased mitochondrial mass and
function in ACC cells
The activity of ERRα is highly dependent on the
presence of coactivator proteins, most notably PGC-1α
and PGC-1β [24], both known for their crucial role in
regulating energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis
[24]. Moreover, it has been observed that XCT790
treatment, causing ERRα proteasome degradation, also
down-regulates PGC1-α [24]. Based on these observations,
we first checked if XCT790 treatment regulates PGC1-α
expression in H295R cells. To this aim, ACC cells were
left untreated or treated with 10 μM XCT790 for 48 h.
Results from Western blotting showed (Figure 4A–4B)
that XCT790 treated cells display a reduced expression of
PGC1-α, with no effect on PGC-1β levels. We then asked
whether reduced levels of PGC1-α would lead to reduction
of mitochondrial mass. To this purpose we treated cells
with MitoTracker deep red FM that stains specifically
mitochondria independently of their membrane potential.
Using flow cytometric analysis (Figure 4C), fluorescent
imaging (Figure 4D) and fluorescent plate reader (Figure
4E), we found that XCT790 significantly decreased
mitochondrial mass.
The mitochondrial citrate carrier CIC is a protein
that belongs to a family of metabolites transporters
embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane [25, 26]
and has been recently highlighted as important component
in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and bioenergetics
in normal and particularly in tumor cells [27]. We used
CIC protein expression as a marker of both mitochondrial
mass and function and found that XCT790 decreased
mitochondrial CIC expression (Figure 4F–4G) as well as
its transport activity (Figure 4H) in H295R-treated cells
compared to vehicle-treated control cells.
To extend these findings, we used immunoblotting
to monitor the abundance of a known reliable marker
of mitochondrial mass, TOM20, in response to 10 μM
XCT790 treatment. We found that XCT790 treatedH295R cells displayed a reduced expression of ERRα, as
expected, concomitantly with a drastic decline of TOM20
protein expression (Figure 5A–5B). Similarly, the analysis
of the expression of the mitochondrial oxidative pathway
(OXPHOS) enzymes showed a substantial reduction of
all the complexes (Figure 5C). In agreement with these
findings, the reduction in the ATP content reveals a
bioenergetics failure induced by XCT790 in treated cells
(Figure 5D).

been made based on studies of gene expression profiling
and genetic syndromes associated with the development
of ACC [30]. Results from these studies have highlighted
the presence of different and important modifications
such as somatic TP53 mutations, alterations at 11p15, a
chromosomal locus of IGFII, H19 and cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor 1C, β-catenin accumulation and activation
of the Wnt signaling pathway and overexpression of SF-1
protein [30]. Moreover we have recently demonstrated the
involvement of ESR1 in ACC cell growth regulation [5].
Genetic modifications and molecular pathways alterations

have as a common purpose the survival and proliferation
of the transformed phenotype. It is currently accepted that
these changes are associated with a concurrent adaptation
and reprogramming of cellular metabolism [31]. In this
scenario adrenocortical tumors are not an exception and
the metabolic receptor ERRα represents a good therapeutic
target. In fact, ERRα is a common downstream target of
multiple pathways and a key factor in controlling the
expression and activity of various bioenergetics processes.
Indeed, it has already been observed that high ERRα gene
expression correlates with unfavorable clinical outcomes

in breast [32] and ovarian cancer [14, 33] and that breast
cancer cells exhibiting high ERRα activity are more
sensitive to growth inhibition by an ERRα inverse agonist
such as XCT790 [34]. Consistent with this findings and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with very recent data reporting high ERRα expression in
adrenal tumors compared to benign and normal adrenal
gland [22], here we report that ERRα is expressed in
H295R cells, the most valid cell model to study ACC

biology. Moreover, our data show that pharmacological
down-regulation of ERRα expression impaired H295R cell
proliferation in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion. Most
importantly, the same inhibitory effect was obtained also in
in vivo experiments using H295R cells as xenograft model.
At the molecular level, the growth inhibition is associated
with a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and by the decreased levels
of G1-phase markers such as Cyclin D1 and pRb while
CDKs protein levels were unaffected. Noteworthy, cell
cycle arrest was not followed by any apoptotic event since
we were unable to detect any morphological data (data not
shown) or biochemical events such caspase activation and
PARP-1 cleavage.
Accumulating data provide evidence that a
caspase-independent form of programed cell death such
as autophagy can be at play under certain conditions
[35]. Therefore we investigated whether the inhibitory
effects induced by XCT790 treatment could be linked
to autophagy. Our results indicated that XCT790
caused a significant increase in autophagic vesicles.
Conco­
mitantly, we observed a drastic reduction in
the expression of PGC1-α protein, which plays a key
role in mitochondrial biogenesis, and of mitochondrial
carrier CIC. The reduction of mitochondrial mass, also
confirmed by the reduction of TOM20 protein expression,
is followed by a considerable and significant decrease
in the ATP concentration. Despite the presence of some
autophagic markers such as the up-regulation of Beclin 1
and the cleaved form of LC3 protein, the formation of
autophagolysosomes seems to be incomplete as evidenced
by the reduction in LAMP1 protein, known to play an
important role during the final steps of autophagy process
[36]. A possible explanation could be a considerable
reduction in the availability of intracellular ATP, required
to drive forward the active cell death mechanism
including autophagy. On the other hand, we cannot
exclude that the observed initial steps of autophagy are
a defense cell response to keep cells alive during energy
failure to counteract the reduced expression and activity
of the master bioenergetic executor ERRα. Moreover,
the bioenergetics crisis following treatment with ERRα
inverse agonist might be responsible for the loss of plasma
membrane integrity, a key signature for a necrotic cell
death, allowing the significant increase in the number of
Trypan blue stained cells.
However, our most significant finding is that in
ACC cells ERRα depletion after XCT790 treatment
clearly caused a reduction of mitochondrial function and
mass leading to the activation of a number of cellular
mechanisms that result in tumor cell death.
It’s now well known that mitochondria with its
direct involvement in bioenergetics, biosynthesis and cell
signaling are mandatory for tumorigenesis. Thus, it’s not
surprising that many studies have begun to demonstrate
that mitochondrial metabolism and signaling is potentially
a successful avenue for cancer therapy. Moreover, ACC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is (in most cases) characterized by steroids producing/
secreting cancer cells highly dependent on functioning
mitochondria to ensure steroidogenic processes. For
these reasons, strategies using mitochondrial metabolism
and signaling as targets should be particularly effective
for ACC treatment. Moreover, our current data obtained
performing in vivo experiments by using H295R cells as
xenograft model and according to previous in vivo studies
performed in breast [37] and leukemia [38] tumor cells
also suggest that chemical depletion of ERRα may be
specific for high energy demanding cells such as tumor
cells without exerting any toxic effect on other tissues.
In conclusion, our study supports the hypothesis that
ERRα represents a valid innovative/alternative target for
the treatment of adrenocortical cancer.

Counterstaining was carried out with methylene-blue
(Sigma-Aldrich). Hematoxylin and eosin Y staining was
performed as suggested by the manufacturer (Bio-Optica,
Milan, Italy).

H295R cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a
density of 1 × 105 cells per well and cultured in complete
medium overnight. Before treatment culture medium was
switched into in DMEM F-12 supplemented with 2.5%
charcoal stripped (CS) FBS and cells were untreated or
treated with different concentration of XCT790 (Tocris
Bioscience, Bristol, UK) for the indicated time. DMSO
(Sigma-Aldrich) was used as vehicle control. Cell viability
was measured using MTT assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Each
experiment was performed in triplicate and the optical
density was measured at 570 nm in a spectrophotometer.
Experiments were repeated three times.

Scoring system

Trypan blue stain was prepared freshly as a 0.4%
solution in 0.9% sodium chloride before each experiment.
After trypsinization, 20 μl cell suspension was added
to 20 μl of Trypan blue solution and mixed thoroughly.
Triplicate wells of dye positive cells from untreated or
XCT790 treated were counted using a hemocytometer and
the experiment was repeated three times.

The immunostained slides of tumor samples were
evaluated by light microscopy using the Allred Score
[39] which combines a proportion score and an intensity
score. A proportion score was assigned representing the
estimated proportion of positively stained tumor cells (0 =
none; 1 = 1/100; 2 = 1/100 to <1/10; 3 = 1/10 to <1/3; 4 =
1/3 to 2/3; 5 = >2/3). An intensity score was assigned by
the average estimated intensity of staining in positive cells
(0 = none; 1 = weak; 2 = moderate; 3 = strong). Proportion
score and intensity score were added to obtain a total score
that ranged from 0 to 8. A minimum of 100 cells were
evaluated in each slide. Six to seven serial sections were
scored in a blinded manner for each sample.

Xenograft model

Cell cycle analysis

Athymic Nude- Foxn1nu mouse 4–6 weeks old)
from Charles River Laboratories [Calco (LC), Italy] were
maintained in groups of five or less and quarantined for
one week. Mice were kept on a 12 h light/dark cycle with
ad libitum access to food and water.
6 × 106 H295R cells suspended in 100 μl of sterile
PBS (Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline) and mixed
with 100 μl of matrigel, were injected subcutaneously
into the intrascapular region of each animal. When tumor
size reached a volume of about 200 mm3 mice were
randomly divided in 2 groups. Animals were injected
every other day with vehicle (soy oil) or XCT790 (2,5
mg/Kg) over a 21 day period. Tumors were measured
with a caliper every two days, volumes were calculated
using the formula V = a b2/2 (V:volume; a is the length of
the long axis, and b is the length of the short axis. At the
end of the treatment period tumors were harvested and
tumor weight and volumes were evaluated. All animal
procedures were approved by the local Ethics Committee
for Animal Research.

H295R cells treated with different doses of XCT790
were fixed, treated with RNase A (20 μg/ml), stained
with Propidium iodide (100 μg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) and
analyzed by Flow Cytometry using BD FACSJazz™ Cell
Sorter (Becton, Dickinson and Co) for DNA content and
cell cycle status.

Trypan blue assay

Caspases 3/7 activity assay
Caspases activity was measured with Caspase-Glo
Assay Kit (Promega Italia SRL, Milano, Italy) following
the manufacturer instruction. The luminescence of each
sample was measured in a plate-reading luminometer
(Gen5 2.01) with Synergy H1 Hybrid Reader. Each
experiment was performed on triplicate wells per
condition.

Mitochondrial mass determination
XCT790 treated or untreated H295R cells
were incubated in serum free medium with 200 nM
Mitotracker deep red (Invitrogen, USA) for 30 min
at 37°C in the dark. After staining, cells were washed
twice with cold PBS, trypsinized, centrifuged at 1200
rpm for 5 min and then resuspended in PBS. Absorption
of MitoTracker deep red FM was determined by FACS
analysis and by fluorescence microscopy. In the same
experimental conditions, fluorescent signal intensity
was also assessed using a fluorescent plate reader (ex.
644 nM; em. 665 nM).

Immunohistochemical analysis
5 μm thick paraffin-embedded sections were mo­
unted on slides precoated with poly-lysine, and then
they were deparaffinized and dehydrated (seven to eight
serial sections). Immuno-histochemical experiments
were performed using rabbit polyclonal Ki67 primary
antibody (Dako, Denmark ) at 4°C over-night. Then,
a biotinylated goat-anti-rabbit IgG was applied for

(GraphPad Software, Inc.; La Jolla, CA) software. Control
and treated groups were compared using the analysis of
variance (ANOVA). A comparison of individual treatments
was also performed, using Student’s t test. Significance
was defined as p < 0.05.

H295R cells were cultured on 6 well plates and
treated in 2.5% CS-FBS with or without 10 μM XCT790.
After 48 h, cells were washed with PBS and stained for
30  min at 37°C with 1 μg/mL acridine orange solution
(Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were then washed three times with
cold PBS and one drop of mounting solution was added.
Cell were observed and imaged by an inverted fluorescence
microscope (100X magnification). Accumulation of the
acidic vacuoles was also determined by FACS analysis.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Mitochondria reconstitution and transport
measurements

The authors declare no conflicts of interest.

REFERENCES

The transport activity was carried out as described
previously [40]. Briefly, isolated mitochondria from
untreated (control) or XCT790 treated H295R cells were
solubilized in a buffer containing 3% Triton X, 114, 4 mg/ml
cardiolipin, 10 mM Na2SO4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM PIPES
pH 7. The mixture was incubated for 20 min and centrifuged
at 138,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incorporated
into phospholipid vesicles by cyclic removal of the detergent
[41]. The reconstitution mixture consisted of 0.04 mg
protein solution, 10% Triton X-114, 10% phospholipids (egg
lecithin from Fluka, Milan, Italy) as sonicated liposomes,
10 mM citrate, 0.85 mg/ml cardiolipin (Sigma) and 20
mM PIPES, pH 7.0. The citrate transport was measured
after external substrate removal from proteoliposomes on
Sephadex G-75 columns, pre-equilibrated with buffer A
(50 mM NaCl and 10 mM PIPES, pH 7.0). Transport at
25°C was started by the addition of 0.5 mM [14C] citrate
(Amersham) to the eluted proteoliposomes and terminated
by the addition of 20 mM 1,2,3-benzene-tricarboxylate.
Finally, the external radioactivity was removed from the
Sephadex G-75 columns, liposomes radioactivity was
measured and transport activity was calculated [41].
