ABSTRACT
Although mast cells (MC) play an important role in allergic reactions, their
physiologic role remains unknown. In mice, several models of MC-deficiency have
been developed. However, no comparable human model is available. We examined
the in vitro- and in vivo effects of the KIT-targeting drug imatinib on growth and
development of human MC. Imatinib was found to inhibit stem cell factor (SCF)induced differentiation of MC in long-term suspension cultures (IC50: 0.01 µM).
Correspondingly, long-term treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients
with imatinib (400 mg/day) resulted in a marked decrease in MC. In patients with
continuous complete molecular response during therapy, bone marrow MC decreased
to less than 5% of pre-treatment values, and also serum tryptase concentrations
decreased significantly (pre-treatment: 32.0±11.1 ng/ml; post-therapy: 3.4±1.8,
p<0.01). Other myeloid lineages, known to develop independently of KIT, were not
affected by imatinib-therapy. Imatinib also produced a substantial decrease in MCdevelopment in mice. However, no clinical syndrome attributable to drug-induced
MC-deficiency was recorded in our CML patients. Together, imatinib suppresses
MC production in vitro and in vivo. However, drug-induced MC depletion is not
accompanied by adverse clinical events, suggesting that MC are less relevant to
homeostasis in healthy tissues than we assumed so far.

INTRODUCTION

granules and express high-affinity receptors for IgE
[1-10]. During an allergic reaction, MC release their
immunomodulating and vasoactive mediators and thereby
contribute to the clinical symptoms of allergy [1-5,9,10].
In addition, MC have been considered to play an important
role in other inflammatory reactions, in natural host

Mast cells (MC) are bone marrow (BM) stem
cell-derived, tissue-fixed, multipotent effector cells of
the immune system [1-8]. These cells store a number of
vasoactive and immunomodulating substances in their

defence, and in tissue homeostasis [1-6].
MC are a rich source of histamine, various proteases
including tryptase and chymase, proteoglycans, and
various cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha
[1-5,11-15]. Moreover, MC exhibit a unique profile of
profibrinolytic and anti-thrombotic substances, such
as tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase
receptor, and heparin [16-18]. It has also been described
that MC increase in number and accumulate around
thrombosed vessels, and that MC supernatants can
dissolve thrombotic clots [16-20]. Finally, it has been
described, that india ink-induced fatal thrombosis
occurs more frequently in MC-deficient mice than in
control animals [21]. Other studies have shown that MCdeficient mice are more susceptible to fatal bacterial
infections compared to control animals [22,23]. All
these observations suggest that MC may fulfil important
functions in i) the immune system and ii) in the vascular
repair system under pathologic conditions. In addition,
MC have been considered to play a role in normal tissue
homeostasis. However, the exact role of MC in normal
healthy (physiologic) tissues has not been described yet.
Whereas several models of MC deficiency are available
in the murine system [1,21-25], no comparable model of
human MC deficiency is available.
A number of previous studies have shown that the
ligand of the KIT tyrosine kinase receptor, stem cell factor
(SCF), promotes the in vitro growth and development
of MC [26-29]. In line with this concept, MC and MC
progenitors express KIT throughout their development
[28-30]. Moreover, it is well accepted that SCF-deficient
mice and KIT-deficient mice exhibit profound MC
deficiency [24,25]. SCF-dependent development of MC
from their immature progenitor cells is a long-lasting
process that takes several months [26-29]. In addition,
mature MC in various organs are considered to be longlived cells that can persist in local tissue sites for several
years [31].
During the past decade, the tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) imatinib has been successfully used for
the treatment of patients with BCR/ABL1+ chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) and for the treatment of FIP1L1/
PDGFRA+ chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL) [32-36].
In fact, imatinib is a potent inhibitor of BCR/ABL1 and
FIP1L1/PDGFRA. In many patients with CML, long-term
disease-free survival and major (MMR) or even complete
molecular responses (CMR) are obtained [32-35]. In
addition, imatinib is a highly potent inhibitor of the KIT
tyrosine kinase [37]. However, the effect of imatinib on
KIT-dependent cells, especially tissue MC, remains at
present unknown. In the current study, we asked whether
long-term treatment of CML patients with imatinib is
associated with MC deficiency.

Imatinib inhibits SCF-induced differentiation of
human MC in long-term culture
It is generally appreciated that SCF promotes the
development and differentiation of human MC [1-3,2628]. In the present study, we were able to confirm the
MC growth-stimulating effect of SCF on CB-derived
MC precursor cells in long-term suspension cultures.
In particular, as assessed by Wright-Giemsa staining,
substantial numbers of MC were detectable in SCFsupplemented cultures on day 28, whereas in cultures
maintained in control medium (without SCF), no MC
were detected (not shown). In addition, cellular histamineand tryptase levels were measured in CB precursor cells
cultured in the presence of SCF. In these cultures, imatinib
was found to inhibit SCF-dependent differentiation of
MC in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1). The growthinhibitory effects of imatinib on MC development were
demonstrable by morphological examination (Figure 1A)
as well as by measuring total histamine and total tryptase
levels in cultured cells (Figure 1B). In addition, imatinib
was found to inhibit SCF-induced expression of tryptase
mRNA and KIT mRNA in long-term suspension cultures
(Figure 1C). Together, these data show that imatinib
exerts profound inhibitory effects on SCF-dependent
development and differentiation of human MC in vitro.

Long-term treatment of CML patients with
imatinib is associated with a substantial decrease
in the numbers of BM MC
The numbers of tryptase+ cells and the numbers of
KIT+ cells in the BM of newly diagnosed patients with
CML exceeded the numbers of tryptase+ and KIT+ cells
detected in the normal BM (Figure 2A and 2B) suggesting
an expansion of clonal tryptase+ cells. After efficacious
long-term treatment with imatinib, defined by MMR (or
CMR) for at least 24 months, the numbers of tryptase+
cells and the numbers of KIT+ cells decreased significantly
(p<0.001) compared to pre-treatment values (Figure
2A and 2B). In addition, we found that the numbers of
tryptase+ cells and KIT+ cells in the BM of our long-termtreated patients were even lower when compared to the
numbers of tryptase+ cells or KIT+ cells (MC) detectable
in the normal BM (p<0.01) (Figure 2A and 2B). The MCdepleting effect of imatinib was confirmed by Giemsastaining (Figure 2C). Figure 2D shows examples of
immunohistochemical stains performed with antibodies
against tryptase and KIT in BM sections obtained from
patients with CML before and after therapy with imatinib.
We also confirmed that long-term treatment with imatinib
results in a complete depletion of clonal cells in the BM.

Tryptase mRNA- and KIT mRNA levels during
treatment with imatinib

In fact, in all MMR patients tested, BCR/ABL1 mRNA
levels in BM mononuclear cells were <0.1% by qPCR,
similar to peripheral blood BCR/ABL levels (not shown).
Since MC development is a long-lasting process and MC
may persist in normal tissues for several years [31] we also
examined BM sections of patients treated with imatinib
for less than 1 year. In this cohort of patients (n=6) the
numbers of tryptase+ cells and KIT+ cells (MC) also
decreased slightly compared to pre-treatment values, but
the decrease was not significant, and the concentrations of
tryptase+ cells and KIT+ cells in the BM were comparable
to that found in the normal BM (Supplemental Figure S1).

In order to confirm imatinib-induced MC deficiency
in our CML patients, we examined MNC derived from
aspirated BM samples by qPCR using primers specific
for mast cell tryptase and KIT. As visible in Figure 3,
tryptase mRNA levels and KIT mRNA levels decreased
significantly during successful long-term treatment
with imatinib in all patients examined. In these patients,
tryptase mRNA levels and KIT mRNA levels were found
to be even lower when compared to that found in normal
BM cells (p<0.01) (Figure 3).

were determined by measuring total cell counts and the percentage of MC on Giemsa-stained slides. Cells were counted using an Olympus
AX-1 microscope equipped with a 100x/1.35 UPlan-Apo objective lens. Results represent the mean±S.D. from 3 independent experiments.

was obtained from patients with CML (n=23) at diagnosis and at the time of major or complete molecular response and at least 2 years on
therapy with imatinib (400 mg/day). In addition, control BM section from 5 patients were examined. Serial sections were prepared from
paraffin-embedded BM specimens and stained with antibodies against tryptase (A) and against KIT (B) by indirect immunohistochemistry
as well as by Giemsa-staining (C). The percentages of tryptase+ mast cells (MC) and KIT+ MC relative to all nucleated BM cells (500

Successful long-term treatment with imatinib
induces a systemic decrease in MC

found when comparing long-term treated CML patients
with normal blood counts (Table 3). Finally, we were
unable to record any adverse events possibly related to
MC-depletion in our CML patients treated with imatinib,
even when MC numbers had decreased to very low levels.
In particular, no increased frequency in thromboembolic
events, severe bacterial or fungal infections or bleedings,
were recorded (Table 4). We were also unable to detect
an increased rate of secondary cancer or leukemias in
our imatinib-treated patients. The most frequent adverse
event was mild to moderate (facial/lid) edema, confirming
previous observations [32-34].

In a next step, we asked whether the effect of
imatinib on MC is a systemic effect. In order to address
this question, we measured serum tryptase levels before
and after treatment with imatinib in a subset of our
patients, and compared post-treatment levels to pretreatment levels and to tryptase levels in healthy controls.
As visible in Figure 4, tryptase levels at diagnosis were
found to be higher compared to tryptase levels in healthy
controls (p<0.01). After treatment with imatinib, serum
tryptase levels decreased significantly in all patients when
compared to pre-treatment levels (p<0.001) or to tryptase
levels in controls (p<0.05) (Figure 4). In several cases,
tryptase decreased to very low or even undetectable levels
(not shown). To exclude that the low serum tryptase level
resulted from deactivation of MC rather than depletion
of MC, we also performed activation experiments. In
these experiments, we found that imatinib neither blocks
IgE-dependent nor SCF-mediated release of histamine
in CB precursor-derived MC or human lung MC (not
shown). Together, these data provide evidence that longterm treatment with imatinib results in a substantial
systemic decrease in MC numbers. Finally, we examined
the influence of long-term imatinib therapy on growth
and differentiation of other blood cells. However, no
significant changes in white blood cell numbers were

Treatment with imatinib induces a marked
decrease in MC numbers in mice
To confirm the effect of imatinib on MC numbers in
vivo in mice, two different mouse strains were employed.
Intraperitoneal injection of imatinib (60 mg/kg/day) in
C57BL/6J mice for 42 days resulted in a time-dependent
decrease in MC in various organ-sites, including the
back-skin, ear-skin, and the gastrointestinal tract, i.e.
gastric mucosa (Figure 5A-C). MC numbers in the backskin decreased from 36.7±10.1 per high power field
(control mice on day 42) to 15.7±4.6 per high power
field in imatinib-treated animals on day 42 (p<0.05),
and a similar decrease was observed in the ear-skin and
in the intestinal mucosa of imatinib-treated C57BL/6J

mice (Figure 5). The MC-depleting effect of imatinib was
also examined in BALB/c mice. In these experiments,
mice were treated with 25 mg/kg imatinib (i.p. injection)
twice daily for 10 days. Treatment of mice with imatinib
resulted in a substantial decrease in the percentage of MC
and a significant decrease in cellular histamine levels in
the peritoneum compared to vehicle control (Figure 5D
and 5E). Although BALB/c mice were only treated for 10
days, the effect of imatinib was demonstrable until day 31
in all animals (Figure 5D and 5E). Histamine levels on day
31 amounted to 70.33±5.69 ng/106 cells in vehicle-controltreated animals, compared to only 2.43±0.76 ng/106 cells
in imatinib-treated mice (p<0.01).

Mast cells are key effector cells of the immune
system and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of
allergic and other immunologic disorders [1-8]. However,
whereas the role of MC in certain disease models is well
established, it remains unclear whether MC also play a role
as physiologic cells in healthy tissues. This is an important
question in basic science as well as in clinical practice
because several different drugs are known to block
MC function, and some of the recently developed KITblocking TKI may even lead to a decrease in MC numbers.
In this study, we show that successful long-term treatment

of CML patients with imatinib results in a profound
decrease in MC numbers. To the best of our knowledge
this is the first description of drug-induced depletion of
MC in the human system. In addition, our data show that
imatinib inhibits SCF-induced and thus KIT-dependent
development of MC from their CB-derived progenitor
cells. However, despite inducing a marked decrease in
MC numbers, long-term treatment of CML patients with
imatinib was not accompanied by major adverse events or
specific symptoms, suggesting that MC may play a less
important biological role in steady state homeostasis of
healthy tissues than has so far been assumed.
The ligand of KIT, SCF, is a well-known
differentiation factor for human MC [1-3,7,26-29]. In the
present study, we were able to confirm that SCF induces
MC differentiation in CB-derived progenitor cells [3840]. In these cultures, we applied a combination of SCF
and IL-6 which may be equally potent or even a more
potent stimulus of MC differentiation compared to SCF
alone [26-29,38-40]. In this assay, imatinib was found to
suppress cytokine-induced development of human MC in
a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of about 10 nM
which is a pharmacologically relevant drug concentration.
Complete suppression of MC development was seen
at 1 µM of imatinib. These data suggest that imatinib
blocks cytokine-dependent differentiation of MC. Since
in vivo development of MC is also considered to depend
primarily on SCF activation of KIT in MC progenitors,
this observation may have clinical implications and may
explain why MC decrease in number during treatment
with imatinib. However, MC development from their
progenitors is a long-lasting process [26-29] and mature
MC may persist in local tissue sites for several months
to years. Based on observations made in transplanted
patients, MC repopulation from their progenitors may take
at least 1 year [31].
Therefore, we decided to examine MC numbers
in the BM of our CML patients after 2 years following
successful treatment with imatinib in this study. Since MC
might also derive from CML stem- and progenitor cells
in such patients, a second requirement was that imatinib
had produced at least MMR, and that these patients were
in MMR or CMR for at least one year. We found that
successful long-term treatment with imatinib produces
a marked decrease in the numbers of BM MC in these
patients. Notably, the numbers of MC decreased from
elevated pre-treatment levels to low or even undetectable
levels in post-therapy BM samples. The decrease in MC
in BM sections was demonstrable by staining for MC
tryptase and KIT as well as by Giemsa staining. Moreover,
we were able to show that imatinib therapy leads to a
substantial decrease in tryptase mRNA and KIT mRNA
levels in BM cells. It is noteworthy to state that MC
concentrations in the BM not only decreased significantly
during imatinib when compared to pre-treatment levels
in our CML patients, but also when compared to MC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

numbers recorded in the BM of normal healthy controls.
Collectively, these data suggest that long-term treatment
with imatinib not only resulted in a markedly suppressed
developent of normal MC but also in suppression of
growth of clonal (BCR/ABL+) MC progenitors, which
was confirmed by qPCR.
To demonstrate that the decrease in MC numbers in
the BM is a long-lasting process and time-dependent, we
also examined a smaller cohort of patients after one year
of treatment with imatinib. In these patients, no significant
decrease in MC numbers was found when compared to
pre-treatment values. We also examined other cell types
in the BM and in the peripheral blood. However, we were
not able to detect a significant decrease of any other cell
type, including basophils, eosinophils or monocytes in our
imatinib-treated CML patients, regardless of the time point
examined. This observation is consistent with the notion
that MC development is specifically dependent on KIT and
thus SCF, whereas the development of other hematopoietic
cell types is dependent on other cytokines, but not SCF
[1-7,26-29]. These data also support the concept that MC
are not derived from blood monocytes or blood basophils
as evidenced by our previous studies [41].
MC are well-known to reside in various tissues
and organ systems [1-8]. Therefore, we were interested
to learn whether imatinib induces local MC deficiency in
the BM or a systemic or even global MC deficiency. Since
we were unable to examine all organ systems by biopsy
in our CML patients, we decided to measure serum total
tryptase levels before and after (during) successful therapy
with imatinib. In this regard it is noteworthy to state that
the basal tryptase level usually results from a constant
release of the enzyme from MC in various tissues [42,43].
Therefore, the basal tryptase level is a generally accepted
parameter of the total body burden of MC in healthy
controls. During anaphylaxis, serum tryptase levels
may transiently increase, and in patients with systemic
mastocytosis, serum tryptase levels are persistently
elevated [43,44]. We were interested to learn whether
imatinib would directly block the spontaneous or IgEdependent release of tryptase from human MC. However,
imatinib failed to block spontaneous or anti-IgE-induced
release of histamine or tryptase in human MC.
In patients with CML, elevated serum tryptase
levels were detected at diagnosis in a subset of patients,
confirming our previous data [45,46]. However, in
contrast to mastocytosis, elevated tryptase levels in
CML apparently result from an increased production and
release in immature basophils [45,46]. Successful longterm treatment of our CML patients with imatinib was
found to result in a significant decrease in serum tryptase
levels. These tryptase levels were found to be even lower
compared to that found in healthy controls. Collectively,
these data suggest that long-term therapy with imatinib
produces not only a substantial decrease in clonal tryptase+
cells (MC and immature basophils) in the BM but also a

PATIENTS AND METHODS

markedly reduced systemic production of normal MC in
various organ systems. An alternative explanation would
be that imatinib inhibits the basal secretion of tryptase
from MC. However, this possibility could be eliminated
as outlined above. Another explanation would be that
a selective depletion of MC in the BM is sufficient to
decrease serum tryptase levels. However, this possibility
seems unlikely. In fact, the numbers of MC in the lungs,
skin, and in the gastrointestinal tract exceed MC numbers
in the BM by far, so that a selective decrease in BM MC
should not lead to a visible decrease in tryptase levels.
To provide definitive evidence for a systemic effect
of imatinib on MC development, we employed two
different mouse strains, namely C57BL/6J and BABL/c.
In both models, animals were treated with imatinib by i.p.
injection, and in both types of mice, the drug produced a
substantial decrease in MC numbers in all organs tested,
including the skin, peritoneum and the gastric mucosa.
In contrast to the human system, imatinib-induced MC
depletion in mice was already seen after a few weeks,
which may be explained by the fact that the development
of murine MC occurs within a (much) shorter time interval
compared to SCF-dependent development of human MC.
MC are well known to fulfil important functions
in the immune system and in allergic reactions [1-9].
Moreover, MC have been described to play a potential
role as repair cells during infections and during or/and
after a thromboembolic event [16-23]. Therefore, we
were interested to learn whether imatinib-induced MC
deficiency would predispose for certain adverse events,
such as thromboembolic events, bacterial or fungal
infections or cancer development. However, although
investigated thoroughly, we were unable to detect an
increased frequency of bacterial or fungal infections,
cancer, or thromboembolic events in our imatinib-treated
patients with CML.
In conclusion, our study shows that the KITblocking TKI imatinib produces a profound decrease in
MC in mice as well as a decrease in MC in patients with
Ph+ CML. However, imatinib-induced MC depletion is
not accompanied by specific adverse events or symptoms,
suggesting that MC are less important cells in the
homeostasis of normal healthy tissues than has been
assumed so far. Finally, imatinib-induced MC depletion
is lineage-specific and not accompanied by a substantial
decrease in other leukocytes, confirming that MC are
derived from a separate stem cell pool but not from mature
blood basophils or blood monocytes.

Patients´ characteristics and bone marrow
sampling
Bone marrow biopsy specimens were obtained
from 29 patients with Ph+ CML. Diagnoses were
established according to WHO criteria [47]. The patients´
characteristics are shown in Table 1. Informed consent was
obtained in all patients before BM or blood was obtained.
All studies were approved by the ethics committee of
the Medical University of Vienna. In 23 patients, biopsy
material was obtained at diagnosis and at the time of
major (MMR) or complete (CMR) molecular response
and at least two years of therapy with imatinib (400 mg/
day). In a smaller cohort of patients (n=6), BM samples
were examined at diagnosis and within the first year of
treatment. All patients were examined for the development
of adverse events during treatment with imatinib.
Furthermore, we examined normal/reactive bone marrow
(n=5) as control.

Reagents
The monoclonal antibody (mAb) G3 (IgG1) against
tryptase was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA),
a rabbit polyclonal antibody against KIT (CD117) from
Dako (Glostrup, Denmark), biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG,
anti-mouse IgG and Vectastain Universal ABC-AP Kit
from Vector Laboratories (Burlingham, CA), and 3-amino9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) from Sigma (St.Louis, MO, USA).
Imatinib was kindly provided by Dr.E.Buchdunger and
Dr.P.Manley (Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland).
Recombinant human (rh) stem cell factor (SCF) was
from Strathmann Biotech (Hannover, Germany) and rh
interleukin-6 (IL-6) from Novartis Pharma AG. RPMI
1640 medium and fetal calf serum (FCS) were purchased
from PAA laboratories (Pasching, Austria) and a histamine
radioimmuno-assay (RIA) from Immunotech (Marseilles,
France). Serum and cellular tryptase levels were measured
by fluoroenzyme-immunoassay (FEIA, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Uppsala, Sweden). The detection limit for total
(alpha+beta-type) tryptase in this assay was 1 ng/mL. The
median serum tryptase level in healthy controls amounts
to 5.6±2.8 ng/mL (range: 0-15 ng/mL) [48].

Mast cell differentiation assay
Ficoll-isolated cord blood (CB) mononuclear
cells (MNC, 1x106/ml) were cultured in 24-well plates
in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, SCF (100
ng/ml) and IL-6 (100 ng/ml). Cultures were maintained
with or without various concentrations of imatinib (0.001www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

1 µM). After 2 weeks, medium, cytokines and imatinib
were replaced. After 4 weeks, cells were recovered and
examined for the percentage of MC by Wright-Giemsastaining, for their histamine- and tryptase content (after
freeze-thawing), and for expression of tryptase- and KIT
mRNA levels by qPCR. Histamine concentrations were
determined by RIA and total tryptase concentrations by
FEIA.

animal research of the University of Cologne and the
Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan (Cachan, France).
Both groups of mice were treated with imatinib by
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. C57BL/6J mice (8-12
week-old) were treated with imatinib (60 mg/kg per
day) or vehicle control (10 mice per group) for 42 days.
After 21 days and 42 days, animals (10 each time point)
were sacrificed. In each group of animals, the skin
(back skin and ear skin), gastric submucosa, and splenic
tissues were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin.
Tissue sections were then examined for the presence and
percentage of MC by Toludine Blue (TB) staining. The
percentage of TB+ cells (MC) among all nucleated cells
was determined by counting cells in five different high
power fields (HPF). In a separate set of experiments,
twenty-four 6 week-old BALB/c mice were divided into
two groups of 12 mice each. One group received 25 mg/
kg imatinib (dissolved in 0.5 mL PBS) twice daily by i.p.
injection for 10 consecutive days, and the second (control)
group of mice received vehicel control. On days 10, 17,
24, and 31, each 3 mice were sacrificed and peritoneal
cells collected after i.p. injection of pre-warmed (37°C)
phenol-red-free RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco Laboratories,
Grand Island, NY). Peritoneal cell suspensions were
examined for the percentage of MC by TB staining (on
a hematocytometer) and for the levels of histamine. For
determining histamine levels, 106 peritoneal cells were
centrifuged and resuspended in 1 ml of phenol red-free
RPMI 1640 medium. Cell suspensions were then subjected
to freeze-thawing, and histamine concentrations were
determined by an automated flow-fluorometric technique
as described [55]. Total histamine content in peritoneal
cell suspensions was expressed in ng per 106 cells.

Immunohistochemical staining of BM sections
The indirect immunoperoxidase staining technique
was performed with serial sections (2 µM) of formalinfixed and paraffin-embedded BM as described [49-51]. For
MC detection and enumeration, antibodies against KIT
(CD117) (polyclonal) and tryptase (mAb G3) were applied
overnight. Slides were then washed and incubated with
biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG, washed,
and then exposed to streptavidin-biotin-peroxidasecomplex. AEC was used as chromogen. The numbers of
tryptase+ cells and KIT+ cells (MC) were determined
using an Olympus BX50F4 microscope connected to
a DP21 camera (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany) and
expressed as percent of nucleated BM cells. We also
confirmed the presence of MC by Giemsa staining and
counted the numbers of MC on Giemsa-stained BM
sections in our CML patients.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
KIT- and tryptase mRNA levels were quantified in
patient-derived BM MNC and cultured CB MNC-derived
MC by qPCR essentially as described [52]. PCR primers
used in this study are shown in Supplementary Table S1.
Expression of KIT- and tryptase mRNA was quantified
on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using iTaq SYBR Green
Supermix with ROX from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). KIT
mRNA levels and tryptase mRNA levels were expressed
as percent of ABL. In clinical follow-up samples, BCR/
ABL1 mRNA levels were adjusted according to the
international scale (IS) [53]. Conventional karyotyping
and fluorescence in situ-hybridization (FISH) were
performed according to published protocols [54].

Statistical analysis
Significance levels were calculated by standard tests,
including the Student´s t-test and analysis of variance
(ANOVA). Differences were considered significant when
p<0.05.
