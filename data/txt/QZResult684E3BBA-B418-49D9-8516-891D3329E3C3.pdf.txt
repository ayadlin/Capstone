Potentiation of the Novel Topoisomerase I Inhibitor
Indenoisoquinoline LMP-400 by the Cell Checkpoint and
Chk1-Chk2 Inhibitor AZD7762
Sheena M. Aris and Yves Pommier

Abstract
Novel topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors are in clinical development to circumvent the drawbacks of
camptothecins (CPT). Here, we report molecular investigations into LMP-400, an indenoisoquinoline Top1
inhibitor in phase 1 clinical trial, by itself and in combination with the cell-cycle checkpoint inhibitor AZD7762.
We examined drug effects on DNA replication and killing of cancer cells and found that LMP-400 showed
synergistic antiproliferative activity when combined with AZD7762 in human colon carcinoma cells. Inhibition of
S-phase progression and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation were similarly induced by LMP-400 and CPT and
were abrogated by AZD7762. Replication studied by single DNA molecule analyses and immunoﬂuorescence
microscopy (molecular combing) showed rapid inhibition of fork progression in response to LMP-400 treatment
with subsequent recapitulation after AZD7762 addition. AZD7762 inhibited both the activation/autophosphosphorylation of Chk1 and Chk2 at nanomolar concentrations in LMP-400–treated cells. This potent dual
inhibition of Chk1 and Chk2 by AZD7762 was below the drug concentrations required to abrogate cell-cycle
inhibition and produce synergism with LMP-400. Also, the synergism was independent of Chk2 both in Chk2complemented cells and Chk2 knockout cells, suggesting additional mechanisms for cell-cycle abrogation by
AZD7762. Together, our ﬁndings show a rationale for combining cell-cycle checkpoint inhibitors with the novel
non-CPT indenoisoquinoline Top1 inhibitors. Cancer Res; 72(4); 979–89. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Topoisomerases are enzymes essential for relieving torsional strain inﬂicted upon DNA by replication, transcription, or
other chromatin processes (1). Topoisomerase I (Top1) functions to unwind supercoiled DNA by the reversible cleavage
and concomitant formation of a 30 tyrosyl-DNA covalent
catalytic intermediate, which is commonly referred to as the
Top1 cleavage complex (Top1cc; refs. 2, 3). Top1-targeted
drugs act as Top1 poisons because they stabilize the Top1cc
intermediates by slowing down their reversal and the religation
of DNA, thereby producing deleterious DNA damage when
replication and transcription collide with the drug-stabilized
Top1cc (1).
Clinical camptothecin (CPT) derivatives, though highly
effective against a wide range of tumors, are limited by their
chemical instability, solubility, ABCG2-mediated efﬂux, and

the rapid reversibility of Top1cc upon drug treatment (4–6).
Indenoisoquinolines were ﬁrst identiﬁed as Top1 inhibitors by
the COMPARE analysis of the National Cancer Institute drug
screen database (7). Although structurally similar to CPT,
idenoisoquinolines are chemically stable, able to overcome
ABCG2 efﬂux while forming more persistent Top1-DNA complexes and maintaining potent antitumor activity (8, 9). LMP400 (NSC-724998, NSC-743400; Fig. 1A) is one of the 2 indenoisoquinolines currently in clinical trial (8, 10, 11).
The potential for indenoisoquinoline derivatives as possible
clinical agents raises the prospect of rationale combinations
with other anticancer agents. Prior studies showed a remarkable synergism between CPT and checkpoint kinase 1/2 (Chk1/
2) inhibitors (12–15). 7-hydroxystaurosporine, UCN-01, was
initially found to potentiate CPT-mediated cytotoxicity in
p53-mutant cells by abrogating the cell-cycle checkpoint
(12). More recent studies extended this ﬁnding to more speciﬁc
Chk1 inhibitors and showed that Chk1 inhibition abrogates the
intra–S-phase checkpoint, which normally manifests by
reduced replication fork speed and increased origin ﬁring
(15). Recently, novel Chk1 and Chk2 inhibitors have been
introduced into therapeutic development (16–20).
Chk1 and Chk2 are serine/threonine kinases, members of
the Ca2þ/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase family in the
kinome (21). In spite of their structural differences, both Chk1
and Chk2 can inactivate CDC25A/C by phosphorylation and
can be targeted by similar drugs (19, 22, 23). Chk1 and Chk2
regulate cell cycle and DNA damage response downstream

(DNA-PK), which are activated by genomic lesions (17, 24).
Chk1 is essential for stabilizing replication forks and for the
progression of cells through G1–S and G2–M (19, 24–26).
Whereas Chk1 activation is primarily dependent on stalled
replication forks, ultraviolet radiation and DNA cross-links,
Chk2 is mainly activated by DNA double-strand breaks (27).
Recently AZD7762 (Fig. 1B), a Chk1/2 inhibitor, has been
shown to synergize with DNA-damaging agents and radiation
to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types (28–32). Examination of a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines with variations in
the p53/MDM2/p14ARF status showed a sensitization to DNA-

damaging agents, such as cisplatin and doxorubicin, when
combined with AZD7762 (32). In combination with gemcitabine, AZD7762 was able to potentiate cell killing in colon and
pancreatic cell lines via mitotic catastrophe (28, 29, 31). In the
case of HCT116, this enhancement of apoptosis coincided with
an increase in ﬁring of suppressed replication origins as
measured by DNA ﬁber combing (29). These data exemplify
the breadth of DNA-damaging agents and tumor types that can
beneﬁt from combinatorial treatment with checkpoint kinase
inhibitors.
This study was undertaken to determine whether novel
checkpoint kinase inhibitors such as AZD7762 can potentiate
the antiproliferative effects of the indenoisoquinolines.

Indenoisoquinoline Potentiation by AZD7762

Methods and Materials
Drugs, cell culture, and cell viability assay
Indenoisoquinoline LMP-400 and CPT were obtained from
the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch of the Developmental
Therapeutics Program, NCI. AZD7762 was provided by AstraZeneca. AZD7762 and CPTs were prepared as dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) stocks at 10 and 5 mmol/L, respectively. LMP-400 was
prepared in sterile H2O as a 5 mmol/L stock. HT29 and HCT116
cells were obtained from the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP; National Cancer Institute), grown in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS
and authenticated by short tandem repeat DNA ﬁngerprinting in
2009. HCT116 Chk2/ cells (kindly provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) were grown in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. HCT15 KD and HCT15
Chk2 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Carol Prives, Columbia
University, New York, NY) were grown in RPMI supplemented
with 10% FBS and 400 mg/mL G418 (Invitrogen). Cells were
seeded at a density of 3,500 cells per well in 96-well plates and
incubated at 37 C for 48 hours before drug addition. At 48 hours,
serial dilutions of each drug starting at 0.02% DMSO for
AZD7762, from stock solutions, were prepared in medium. After
medium was aspirated, 100 mL of drug solution was added to
appropriate wells with cells exposed to no more than 0.02%
DMSO. The plates were incubated at 37 C for 48 hours. Cell
proliferation was assayed by adding 20 mL of MTS (Promega) to
each well, incubating at 37 C for 25 minutes and then reading
plates at 490 nm. Data were plotted with GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad Software Inc.) from raw absorbance values.
BrdUrd incorporation and cell-cycle analysis
HT29 cells were exposed to 0.3 mmol/L LMP-400 for 1 hour,
media was removed and cells washed with 1 PBS. Cells were
then treated with 100 nmol/L AZD7762 (0.01% DMSO) for
indicated time points with the addition of 50 mmol/L BrdUrd
30 minutes before harvesting. Following ﬁxation with 70%
ethanol, DNA was denatured using 2 N HCl and 0.5% Triton
X-100 and then neutralized with 0.1 mol/L sodium borate (pH
8.5). Samples were washed twice with 0.5% Tween 20 and 0.5%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, anti-BrdUrd ﬂuorescein
isothiocyanate (Becton Dickinson) was added for 1 hour. Following 2 washes, samples were incubated with RNase–propidium iodide and analyzed on a FACScan ﬂow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson).
Western blotting
After treatment at the indicated drug concentrations, cells
were harvested, lysed (2% SDS, 0.06 mol/L Tris-HCl; pH 6.8) and
protein concentrations determined. Proteins (60 mg) were
electrophoresed on 4% to 20% polyacrylamide gels, and the
gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes that were
incubated with antibodies. All Chk1 and Chk2 antibodies were
obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies and the gH2AX
antibody (clone JBW301 used at 1:1,000 dilution from Upstate).
After incubation with anti-mouse or rabbit secondary antibody
(1:10,000; Sigma), signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).

DNA ﬁber analysis
Approximately 5  105 cells were plated in each well of a 6well plate. Cells were pulse-labeled with 100 nmol/L iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) for 45 minutes, washed with prewarmed
(37 C) PBS, and pulsed with 100 nmol/L chlorodeoxyuridine
(CldUrd) for 45 minutes (15, 29). The medium was prewarmed
before pulses. To investigate the impact of LMP-400 on fork
progression, 10 mmol/L LMP-400 was added during the ﬁrst 30
minutes of the CldUrd pulse. The checkpoint kinase inhibitor,
AZD7762 (0.01% DMSO), was added during both pulses at a
concentration of 100 nmol/L. After drug treatments, cells were
embedded in agarose at a density of 5  105 per 100 mL, the
resulting plugs were treated with 1 mg/mL proteinase K and
1% N-Lauroyl sarcosine in 0.5 mol/L EDTA (pH 8) overnight at
50 C. The plugs were then washed 3 times with 1 Tris-EDTA
(TE, pH 8), melted in 0.1 mol/L 2-(N-morpholino)ethane
sulphonic acid (MES) for 20 minutes at 70 C and digested
with b-agarase (NEB) at 42 C overnight. The DNA was then
stretched onto silane-treated slides (15), which were then
baked for 1.5 hours at 60 C and the DNA denatured with 0.5
mol/L NaOH for 5 minutes. The slides were rinsed 3 times in
PBS and incubated with the following antibodies: mouse antiBrdUrd ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (Becton Dickinson) and rat
anti-CldUrd (Accurate Chemical and Science Co.) diluted in 1%
BSA. After incubation in a humid chamber for 1 hour at room
temperature, slides were washed 3 times, each time for 3
minutes in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The slides were
incubated with secondary ﬂuorescent antibodies [Alexa antimouse 488 (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen)and Alexa anti-rat
594 (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) diluted in 1% BSA] for 20
minutes at 37 C. Slides were washed 3 times for 5 minutes in
PBS and mounted by Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Pictures were acquired with the Pathway microscope and Attovision software (Becton Dickinson). Signals were measured by
ImageJ software (National Cancer Institute/NIH), with some
modiﬁcations made speciﬁcally to measure DNA ﬁbers.
Statistical analysis
Synergism was assessed by CompuSyn Software. All other
statistical analyses were conducted on GraphPad Prism.

Results
AZD7762 sensitizes HT29 colon carcinoma cells to
LMP-400
To evaluate the potential impact of AZD7762 on LMP-400–
induced cell killing, human colon carcinoma HT29 cells were
exposed to a combination of AZD7762 and LMP-400 or to each
drug alone over a 48-hour time course of continuous treatment. This protocol was chosen based on the fact that the
antiproliferative effect of Top1 inhibitors is optimum with long
exposure and that the checkpoint response and cell-cycle
arrest induced by Top1 inhibitors are observed several
hours after the initiation of treatment. LMP-4000 s IC50 was 0.47
mmol/L (Fig. 1C), similar to that of CPT (IC50 ¼ 0.56 mmol/L;
Supplementary Fig. S1). The concentration-dependent effect of
AZD7762 on LMP-400–mediated cytotoxicity was examined at
4 ﬁxed noncytotoxic concentrations of AZD7762 (16, 31, 63, and

125 nmol/L; Fig. 1). A concentration response for AZD7762 in
HT29 as well as the other cell lines tested can be seen in
Supplementary Fig. S2. A synergistic effect of AZD7762 was
observed at all 4 doses tested, with the strongest effect at 125
nmol/L of AZD7762, as assessed by CompuSyn analysis (Fig.
1D), which showed CI (combination index) values below 0.1.
These data show the synergistic effect of the combination of
AZD7762 with LMP-400.
AZD7762 abrogates the S-phase arrest mediated by both
LMP-400 and CPT
Top1 inhibition is known to result in intra–S-phase arrest
due to activation of Chk1/2 (8, 15, 33, 34). The ability of LMP400 to induce such a pattern of replicative arrest was evaluated
by a time-dependent exposure to 0.3 mmol/L of LMP-400 and

982

Cancer Res; 72(4) February 15, 2012

assessed via BrdUrd incorporation. The protocol for addition
of both drugs is outlined in Fig. 2A. A modest effect on the cell Sphase progression was observed after 1.5 hours of LMP-400
treatment (Fig. 2B). However, the effect of LMP-400 shows a
deﬁnite time dependence due to the marked decrease in the
number of cells staining positive for BrdUrd in the late S phase
at the 4- and 7-hour time points. Consistent with the interpretation that this S-phase arrest is checkpoint dependent, 100
nmol/L AZD7762 was able to abrogate this arrest (Fig. 2B).
The DMSO soluble analog of LMP-400, NSC 724998, has
previously been shown to induce both S and G2–M phase
arrests like CPT (8). Addition of AZD7762 or CPT was carried
out as per Fig. 2C. To further establish the similarity between
LMP-400 and CPTs, the effects of LMP-400 and CPT on S-phase
arrest were assessed in parallel (Fig. 2D). As expected, both CPT

incorporation at the end of the 6 hours incubation with or
without AZD7762, as described above. The DNA synthesis
inhibition induced by LMP-400 was observed over a broad
concentration range and was clearly observed at 0.3 mmol/L
LMP-400 (Fig. 3B). At the same time, cells were arrested in
early S phase, and the arrest tended to occur earlier in the
cell cycle as the LMP-400 concentration increased (Fig. 3C).
Regardless of the extent of S-phase arrest induced by LMP400, 100 nmol/L AZD7762 was able to reactivate DNA
synthesis as measured by BrdUrd incorporation and to
reestablish a normal cell-cycle proﬁle, albeit with a
decreased G1 population and a residual population of cell
arrested in S phase at the highest LMP-400 concentrations (3
and 10 mmol/L; Fig. 3B and C). These results show the
selectivity of LMP-400 for S-phase cells and the effectiveness
of AZD7762 in abrogating the cell cycle and DNA synthesis
effects of LMP-400.

and LMP-400 abrogated BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 2D, left). In
conjunction with this, a dose-responsive treatment with
AZD7762 was carried out. Under these conditions, 6 hours of
continuous treatment with AZD7762 attenuated the effect of
both drugs at concentrations as low as 10 nmol/L AZD7762.
Thus, not only is LMP-400 as effective at inducing S-phase
arrest as CPTs but also AZD7762 is a potent inhibitor of this
arrest.
S-phase arrest induced by high concentrations LMP-400
is abrogated by AZD7762
To test the efﬁcacy of LMP-400 for inducing a substantial
S-phase arrest and the extent to which this arrest could be
abrogated by AZD7762, experiments were carried out over a
broad range of LMP-400 concentrations. Prior to the addition of AZD7762 for 6 hours, cells were treated with LMP-400
for 1 hour (Fig. 3A). DNA synthesis was monitored by BrdUrd

Reduction of replication fork velocity and interorigin

To elucidate the effect of LMP-400 and AZD7762 on DNA
replication and checkpoint control, cells treated with each
drug alone or with a combination of both were subjected to
single molecule DNA analyses by molecular combing
(15, 35, 36). Individual replicons were visualized by immunoﬂuorescence microscopy with 2 speciﬁc antibodies after
sequential DNA incorporation of the thymidine analogs IdUrd
and CldUrd for 45 minutes each (Fig. 4A). To assess the impact
of LMP-400 and AZD7762 on DNA replication fork velocity, the
percentage frequency of the ratio of red to green pulses were
plotted (Fig. 4B). As expected, the ratios for both untreated
(control) and AZD7762-treated HT29 cells were close to 1 (0.93

984

Cancer Res; 72(4) February 15, 2012

and 0.87, respectively), indicating an equal replication fork
velocity over both pulses.
A reduction in the CldUrd:IdUrd ratio to 0.64 was observed
for LMP-400–pulsed cells (Fig. 4B), inferring that the 30-minute
pulse with LMP-400 during CldUrd incubation was sufﬁcient to
rapidly impact ongoing replication forks (15). Analysis of
replication fork velocities showed a mean velocity of 1.05
kb/min for control cells and 0.83 kb/min for LMP-400–treated
cells, a 20% decrease in the mean velocity for LMP-400 as
compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4C). The LMP-400–
induced slowdown of replication forks was partially abrogated
in the presence of AZD7762, as seen by the recapitulation of the
CldUrd:IdUrd ratio to 0.79 (Fig. 4B, compare the top and
bottom panels).

Notably, AZD7762 by itself produced a consistent reduction
in replication velocity (Fig. 4C). In the AZD7762-treated cells,
there was no additional decrease in fork velocity upon addition
of LMP-400 (Fig. 4C, right panel), indicating that AZD7762
abrogates the LMP-400-induced intra-S-phase checkpoint
component associated with reduction of fork velocity.
Distances between individual replication fork origins can
also be measured by molecular combing (15, 36). Interorigin
distances in drug-treated cells are reported in Fig. 4D. Consistent with the fact that one of the components of the intra–Sphase checkpoint consists in an increased origin ﬁring
(15, 36, 37), LMP-400 induced on average a 25% decrease in
the interorigin distances. In line with the inhibitory effect of
AZD7762 on replication velocity, we found that AZD7762, by
itself increased origin ﬁring, as measured by a reduction of
interorigin distances. In the AZD7762-treated cells, LMP-400
also failed to signiﬁcantly impact origin ﬁring. Taken together,
our results are consistent with a rapid activation of the intra–Sphase checkpoint by LMP-400 and with AZD7762 acting as a
cell-cycle checkpoint abrogator (28, 29, 34).

AZD7762 is a potent inhibitor of both Chk1 and Chk2 and
abrogates their autophosphorylation activation
Because the replication checkpoint is under the control of
Chk1 and Top1 targets are well-established activators of both
Chk1 and Chk2 (15, 33, 34), we determined the activation of
Chk1 and Chk2 by LMP-400 and the impact of AZD7762 of
these activations.
Both Chk1 and Chk2 are activated by autophosphorylation,
and Western blotting was used to measure the effects of LMP400 and AZD7762 on Chk1 and Chk2 activations. The kinetics
of checkpoint kinase activations by LMP-400 in the absence
and presence of AZD7762 were ﬁrst examined in time course
experiments. Reactions were followed over the course of 7
hours and assessed by Western blotting for both Chk1 and
Chk2 autophosphorylations (Chk1 pS296 and Chk2 pS516) (Fig.
5A). LMP-400 induced detectable activation of both kinases at
the 1.5 hour time point with further activation throughout the
time course. These data indicate that the full activation of both
Chk1 and Chk2 checkpoint kinases by LMP-400 increases well
after the removal of the drug. Figure 5A also shows that
AZD7762 blocks LMP-400–induced autophosphorylations of
both Chk1 and Chk2.
Concentration-response experiments were then carried out
to determine the potency of AZD7762 and its relative activity
on Chk1 versus Chk2 (Fig. 5B). AZD7762 was able to inhibit
both Chk1 and Chk2 autophosphorylations at subnanomolar
concentrations (Fig. 5B). Moreover, AZD7762 had no impact on
the upstream kinases as shown by its lack of activity against
pT68-Chk2 (Fig. 5B). These experiments show the potency of
AZD7762 against Chk1 and Chk2 activation in cellular systems.
The impact of AZD7762 on the DNA damage response was
evaluated by phosphorylation of histone H2AX as a sensitive
biomarker (11). A signiﬁcant induction of gH2AX was observed
after treatment for 1 hour with LMP-400 (Fig. 5B, lane 2), which
is consistent with prior experiments (8, 11). This gH2AX
response was detectably enhanced by concentrations of
AZD7762 at 10 nmol/L and above (Fig. 5B). The enhancement

(DSB; see Discussion).
Effect of LMP-400 and AZD7762 combination on a panel
of colon carcinoma cell lines with Chk2 alterations
To demarcate the importance of Chk2 inhibition in the
AZD7762-mediated synergistic effect observed with LMP400, colon carcinoma cell lines with genetic Chk2 alterations
were tested (Fig. 6).
HCT-15 colon carcinoma cells are naturally deﬁcient for
Chk2 due to biallelic CHEK2 mutations: R145W on 1 allele and
A247D on the other, which both destabilize Chk2 polypeptides
(38). HCT15 cells have also been used to study the functional
roles of Chk2 by complementation with wild-type (WT) or
kinase-dead (KD) Chk2 mutants (39). Figure 6A shows that the
HCT15 cells complemented with a HA-tagged Chk2-expressing
plasmid (left) are slightly more sensitive to LMP-400 than their
kinase-dead counterpart (right; IC50's of 160 vs. 390 nmol/L,

AZD7762 with LMP-400 was more profound on the HCT15

with either HCT116 cell line tested (Fig. 6C). Both HCT116
cell lines showed a high sensitivity to LMP-400 and few
synergistic data points when treated with AZD7762 (Fig. 6D).
Together, these results (Table 1) show that the synergistic
effect of AZD7762 on LMP-400–induced cell killing is not
directly related to the inhibitory activity of AZD7762 on
Chk2.

Discussion
Clinically available Top1-targeted drugs, though highly successful, have warranted the development of novel non-CPT
derivatives due to aforementioned chemical, biochemical, and
cellular limitations of CPT derivatives (41–44). As a class, the
indenoisoquinolines induce Top1ccs that persist longer than
CPTs, have a markedly different DNA cleavage pattern, and
avoid drug efﬂux (8). Although indenoisoquinolines have been
shown to induce both S- and G2–M-phase arrest, the extent to
which LMP-400 modulates cell-cycle arrest and DNA replication has not been investigated previously. Critical for the
progression of cells through S and G2–M phase, Chk1, and
Chk2 are also essential for the DNA damage response. Checkpoint inhibition has been shown to potentiate the activity of
chemotherapeutic agents such as IR, gemcitabine, and CPT
(16–20, 29).
Checkpoint kinase inhibitors, such as UCN-01 and CHIR124, restore DNA replication and cell-cycle progression in CPTtreated cells (13, 22, 28, 34). Furthermore, indenoisoquolines
have been shown at low concentrations to induced a G2–M
arrest and S phase at slightly higher doses after 6 hours of
continuous exposure (8). Our data shows that LMP-400–treated HT29 cells induce a marked inhibition on S-phase progression at submicromolar concentration treatments, consistent with Top1 inhibition. Activated by ATR in response to
replication block, Chk1 is the primary kinase associated with Sphase arrest (45). Chk1 acts to maintain fork progression via its
role in regulating Cdk2 and CDC25. Although Chk1 is the
predominant kinase that affects S-phase progression, Chk2
has been shown to participate in the S-phase response after UV
treatment (46). Consistent with the ability of checkpoint
kinases to inhibit S-phase progression, AZD7762 treatment
was able to reestablish a normal cell-cycle proﬁle after exposure to LMP-400.
Persistent Top1ccs lead to increased DNA DSBs detectable
by histone H2AX activation as seen in Fig. 5. LMP-400–induced
slowdown of the replication fork velocity is consistent with
DNA damage–induced activation of checkpoint proteins inhi-

biting S-phase progression to maintain genomic stability. This
is a signiﬁcant ﬁnding as it illustrates that indenoisoquinolines
are effective activators of the checkpoint kinases. Chk1 inhibition is implicated in the recapitulation of S-phase progression of cells after treatment with agents, such as CPT and IR, as
it is activated by stalled DNA replication forks (13, 22, 34, 45).
Moreover, inhibition of the ATR-Chk1 pathway has been
shown to slowdown fork breakage and repair after interstrand
cross-linking (47). AZD7762 increases the origin ﬁring in
HCT116 cells, by itself and also when treated with gemcitabine
(29). In addition to this, our data shows that the interorigin
distances of replication forks are decreased in HT29 cells along
with the fork velocity. Taken together, these data infer a role for
Chk1 in the overall slowdown of replication fork progression,
independent of DNA damage. This study emphasizes the
effectiveness of LMP-400 as a potent Top1 poison and potential
for therapeutic enhancement that is afforded when combined
with checkpoint inhibition.
Checkpoint inhibitors can be highly promiscuous at concentrations above those needed to inhibit the kinase activity in
vitro. UCN-01, for example, can inhibit PKC, PKA, PDK1, and vSRC tyrosine kinase at nanomolar concentrations (48, 49).
AZD7762 is an equitoxic inhibitor of both checkpoint kinases,
as shown by the inhibition of both the autophosphorylation of
Chk1 and Chk2 in AZD7762-treated cells is not surprising (28).
Our study is the ﬁrst demonstration by Western blot analysis of
the downregulation of Chk2 autophosphorylation by AZD7762
in cells.
Our results indicate no further enhancement of the synergistic effect of LMP-400 by either upregulating or inhibiting
Chk2 expression (31), which infers that the AZD7762-mediated
synergism observed in these cell lines may be dependent on
other cellular targets. The synergism between AZD7762 and
Top1 inhibitors occurs at pharmacologic concentrations in
which AZD7762 abrogrates the S- and G2 checkpoints induced
by the Top1 inhibitors, but that these concentrations are above
the threshold of AZD7762 concentrations required to inhibit
Chk1 and Chk2. Thus, our ﬁndings that Chk1 (and Chk2)
inhibition is observed at much lower concentration than those
required to affect cell-cycle arrest and produce synergy suggest
that additional mechanisms are involved in the synergism and
mechanisms of action of AZD7762. These observations point
out to the need to test both Chk2 and Chk1 and correlate their
inhibition with ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analyses when developing cell-cycle checkpoint inhibitors.
Interestingly, in vivo data show that Chk1 and Chk2 are
cooperatively haploinsufﬁcient in their ability to regulate

apoptosis (50). It is altogether possible that other kinases are
important in AZD7762-mediated cell death, as AZD7762 was
shown to inhibit members of the CAM kinase and SRC-like
family (28).
In summary, we have shown that LMP-400 is a potent Top1
inhibitor whose effect can be enhanced by checkpoint inhibition. These data provide a rationale for combining cell-cycle
checkpoints inhibitors with LMP-400- and Top1-targeted
drugs. Also, they suggest that cancer cells with intrinsic
checkpoint defects might be selectively sensitive to LMP400. Finally, although AZD7762 is a highly active Chk1/2
inhibitor, it is possible that contributions from additional
kinase inhibitions exist. In any case, the unambiguous
improvement in antiproliferative activity when combined with
Top1 inhibition reenforces the rationale for pursuit of combination of Top1-targeted drugs with checkpoint kinase
inhibitors.
