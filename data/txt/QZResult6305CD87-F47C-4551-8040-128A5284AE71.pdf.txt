ABSTRACT
Survival rate in ovarian cancer has not improved since chemotherapy was
introduced a few decades ago. The dismal prognosis is mostly due to disease
recurrence where majority of the patients succumb to the disease. The demonstration
that tumors are comprised of subfractions of cancer cells displaying heterogeneity
in stemness potential, chemoresistance, and tumor repair capacity suggests that
recurrence may be driven by the chemoresistant cancer stem cells. Thus to improve
patient survival, novel therapies should eradicate this cancer cell population. We show
that in contrast to the more differentiated ovarian cancer cells, the putative CD44+/
MyD88+ ovarian cancer stem cells express lower levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase,
Cox–I, Cox-II, and Cox–IV, and higher levels of UCP2. Together, this molecular
phenotype establishes a bioenergetic profile that prefers the use of glycolysis over
oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. This bioenergetic profile is conserved
in vivo and therefore a maintenance regimen of 2-deoxyglucose administered after
Paclitaxel treatment is able to delay the progression of recurrent tumors and decrease
tumor burden in mice. Our findings strongly suggest the value of maintenance with
glycolysis inhibitors with the goal of improving survival in ovarian cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION

advantage of using the combination of platinum (most
often carboplatin) and taxane (most often paclitaxel)
compounds [5-7]. Although the mechanisms of action
of chemotherapy agents are diverse, most exploit the
difference in the proliferation rate between normal
cells and cancer cells. Highly proliferating cancer cells
are more sensitive to the effects of DNA damage and
microtubule stabilization, the actions of platinum and
taxane compounds, respectively. However, despite
advances in the understanding of how these compounds
induce cell death and how chemoresistance develops at
the molecular level, this knowledge has not translated into
better survival for patients.
In the past decade, numerous studies have
demonstrated the heterogeneity of cancer cells that
comprise the tumors. A specific cancer cell population,
the cancer stem cells, has been shown to be responsible
for tumor-initiation, progression, recurrence and

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) accounts for the
greatest number of deaths from gynecologic malignancies
[1-3]. A newly diagnosed patient commonly presents with
advanced-stage disease but usually undergoes remission
after initial surgical debulking and first-line chemotherapy.
Unfortunately, in spite of the initial response to treatment,
almost all patients recur within 2 to 5 years [4]. At
recurrence, the development of resistance to most of the
currently available agents limits the efficacy of second
round chemotherapy. Thus the five-year survival rate
for EOC remains very low at about 30% [4]. Therefore,
to improve survival, it is necessary to identify novel
treatment modalities that can prevent recurrence or target
chemoresistant recurrent disease.
Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer was initiated in
the 1970s and data from multiple trials has supported the

chemoresistance [8-18]. Compared to their differentiated
counterparts, cancer stem cells isolated from various
cancers have consistently been shown as inherently and
extremely resistant to currently available chemotherapy
agents. It is hypothesized that cancer stem cells left after
surgery can survive chemotherapy and are able to reestablish the tumor leading to recurrence [17, 19]. In EOC,
we and others have shown that CD44+/MyD88+ epithelial
ovarian cancer stem cells (EOC stem cells) possess tumorinitiating properties and exhibit diverse resistance to a
wide-range of chemotherapy agents including, but not
limited to, platinums and taxanes [20-26]. Interestingly,
CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cells do not proliferate as
rapidly as differentiated cancer cells [20]. This may be
one of the myriad reasons why this cancer cell population
is resistant to chemotherapy.
In addition to the proliferation rate, another main
difference between cancer cells and normal cells is the
predilection of cancer cells, even in normoxic conditions,
to utilize the less efficient glycolysis pathway over the
more efficient mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) to generate ATP (Warburg effect) [27,
28]. Indeed, it has been demonstrated for decades that
compared to normal cells, cancer cells have enhanced
glucose uptake, high lactic acid production, and almost
absent mitochondrial respiration even when oxygen
levels are sufficient [29, 30]. Enhanced glucose uptake
in cancer cells have been demonstrated to fulfill the ATP
and NADPH requirements of fast-dividing cells [31]. It
is however not clear if the Warburg effect also occurs
in cancer stem cells. This is extremely important, since
this would suggest that, whereas classical chemotherapy
agents are only effective against the differentiated
cancer cells, compounds inhibiting glycolysis may
target both differentiated cancer cells as well as the
more undifferentiated and chemoresistant cancer stem
cells. Therefore glycolysis inhibitors may be used in
combination with the standard of care chemotherapy
agents. Such regimen would target the two known cancer
cell populations, possibly preventing recurrence and
improving patient survival.
The aim of this study is to determine the unique
bioenergetic requirements of CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem
cells. Towards this goal we compared the requirement for
glycolysis and mitochondrial OXPHOS in the generation
of ATP in clones of EOC stem cells and their differentiated
counterpart (CD44-/MyD88- EOC cells). Our results
show that in the chemoresistant CD44+/MyD88+ EOC
stem cells, baseline ATP is mainly produced from the
glycolysis pathway and moreover the generation of ATP
from OXPHOS is blocked at multiple levels. Therefore,
under glucose limiting conditions and even in the presence
of OXPHOS substrates, EOC stem cells are unable to
efficiently and promptly engage OXPHOS leading to
subsequent loss of ATP and consequently cell death.
We also provide a proof of concept demonstrated in an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

intra-peritoneal (i.p.) ovarian cancer xenograft model,
which shows that glycolysis inhibitors are able to delay
recurrence and inhibit progression of recurrent disease.
Our study highlights the value of a maintenance regimen
with glycolysis inhibitors to improve survival in ovarian
cancer patients.

RESULTS
CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cells require glucose
for survival
To determine the response of the two subtypes of
ovarian cancer cells to glucose deprivation, we cultured
the clones described in the Methods section in the
presence or absence of glucose and quantified the growth
rate by measuring culture confluence. We saw a significant
reduction in the growth rate of CD44-/MyD88- EOC
cells under glucose-free condition compared to glucoseenriched condition (Fig. 1A). Whereas the doubling-time
for the clones in glucose-enriched media is ~18h, the
doubling-time in glucose-free condition was ~40h. The
decrease in growth rate was however, not accompanied
by cell death. Analysis of cellular morphology showed
that in glucose-free condition, CD44-/MyD88- EOC
cells remained viable (Fig. 1B), albeit with a slower
proliferation rate. On the other hand, we observed
significant cell death in the CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem
cells 12h after the addition of glucose-free media (Fig.
1A,B). Interestingly, further studies showed that cell
death in these cells is not associated with typical apoptotic
markers. We did not observe loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential (Fig. 1C) nor activation of caspases
(Fig. 1D). Instead, we observed the occurrence of
autophagy as evidenced by increase in LC3B-II (Fig. 1E).
These results indicate that whereas CD44-/MyD88- EOC
cells require glucose to sustain their baseline proliferation
rate, CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cells require glucose for
survival and therefore suggest dependence to glucose.

CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cells have a more
glycolytic phenotype
The demonstration that CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem
cells undergo cell death when glucose is not available
suggests that these cells significantly rely on the glycolysis
pathway for their energy needs. To confirm this, we
quantified ATP in all the clones in the presence or absence
of glucose. Our results showed that CD44-/MyD88- EOC
clones can maintain ATP in glucose-free media (Fig. 2A).
In contrast, we observed a significant decrease in ATP
levels in CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cell clones when
grown in the absence of glucose (Fig. 2A). The decrease
in ATP may be associated with the observed increase in

phosphorylated AMPK (pAMPK) (Fig. 1E), and probably
contributes to the observed autophagic cell death in the
EOC stem cells. The glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose
(2-DG) had similar effect on the clones. ATP levels were
marginally decreased in CD44-/MyD88- EOC clones but
significantly decreased in the CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem
cell clones treated with 2-DG (Fig. 2B). These results
demonstrate that in the EOC stem cells baseline ATP is
maintained primarily by the glycolysis pathway.
Glucose-avid cells are known to have higher
levels of glucose transporters and enzymes involved
in the glycolysis pathway. Upregulation of these
proteins have been the classical method to demonstrate
a glycolytic phenotype. We have previously performed
gene expression microarray analysis comparing CD44+/
MyD88+ EOC stem cells and CD44-/MyD88- EOC cells
[20]. Using the data generated, we performed pathway
analysis and surprisingly did not observe any significant
difference in the key bioenergetic pathways tested, at
least at the message level (data not shown). However,
functional analysis such as quantification of lactic acid
secretion showed that CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem clones
(OCSC1, OCSC2, OCSC5, OCSC6) produce higher levels
of lactic acid per cell compared to CD44-/MyD88- EOC
clones (OCC1, OCC2, OCC3) (Fig. 2C). Thus, although
we did not see a difference at the mRNA level, the lactic
acid quantification assay demonstrate that indeed CD44+/
MyD88+ EOC stem cells are more glycolytic than CD44-/
MyD88- EOC cells.

Inability to maintain ATP levels in the absence of
glucose or in the presence of glycolysis inhibitors suggest
that EOC stem cells can not switch to mitochondrial
OXPHOS. OXPHOS occurs within the electron transport
chain (ETC) and results from the entry of reducing
equivalents such NADH, FADH2 or succinate generated
in the Citric Acid Cycle into either Complex I or Complex
II of the ETC. Transfer of electrons from the reducing
equivalents to the different components of the ETC
leads to the generation of a proton gradient, which is
used as energy to phosphorylate ADP and generate ATP.
To determine the ability of EOC stem cells to generate
ATP by OXPHOS we treated the clones with succinate.
CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cell clones did not show an
increase in ATP when treated with succinate (Fig. 3A). In
addition, succinate was not able to rescue ATP levels in the
EOC stem cells treated with 2DG (Fig. 3B). In contrast,
an initial increase in ATP was observed in CD44-/MyD88EOC cell clones treated with succinate although it was
not sustained through time (Fig. 3B and data not shown).
Taken together, these results show that EOC stem cells
cannot switch to mitochondrial OXPHOS to generate ATP
under glucose-limiting conditions and even when reducing
equivalents are available.

EOC stem cells possess more mitochondria but
are not purposed for ATP production

to generate ATP by OXPHOS cannot be attributed to
inferior levels of mitochondria nor inability to sustain
optimal proton gradient.
We then characterize the mitochondrial components
that are directly related to ATP production. We focused our
attention on: 1) the components of the ETC; 2) pyruvate
dehydrogenase (PDH), which is a key enzyme in shifting
pyruvate towards the mitochondrial Citric Acid Cycle
and therefore away from glycolyis and; 3) uncoupling
protein 2 (UCP2), an anion/proton carrier that diverts the
proton gradient away from ATP production towards the
generation of heat. Western blot analysis of the different
components of the ETC show that although CD44+/
MyD88+ EOC stem cells possess more mitochondria than
CD44-/MyD88- EOC cells, EOC stem cells have lower
levels of Complex I, Complex II, and Complex IV (Fig.
4C). In addition, PDH is undetectable in OCSC2 and
consistently lower in the EOC stem cell clones compared
to their differentiated counterpart (Fig. 4D). This suggests
that in the EOC stem cells, pyruvate is unable to enter the
Citric acid cycle and therefore the generation of ATP from
this molecule can only occur by conversion to lactic acid in
the cytoplasm. Interestingly, in the differentiated CD44-/
MyD88- EOC cells, although PDH is highly expressed, it
mostly occurs in the phosphorylated or inactive state (Fig.
4D). This shows that PDH activity is regulated by different
mechanisms in the two subtypes of EOC cells. Although
the endpoint is inhibition, PDH activity is regulated in

Earlier studies looking into the molecular foundation
for the Warburg effect suggests that cancer cells rely on
glycolysis for its ATP needs even in normoxic conditions
due to defective mitochondria [32]. However, mutations
or permanent mitochondrial defects cannot explain the
dependence of CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cells on
glucose since upon differentiation to CD44-/MyD88EOC cells [20] this dependence is reduced. Thus, we
characterized the mitochondria of the EOC stem cell
clones and compared them with their differentiated
counterpart. Using Mitotracker Green and Mitotracker
Red, we quantified mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial
membrane potential (MMP), respectively. Flow cytometry
analysis demonstrate that compared to the CD44-/MyD88EOC cell clones, CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cell clones
possess more mitochondria. Mean fluorescent intensity
(MFI) from Mitotracker green is two-fold higher in
OCSC1, OCSC2, and OCSC6 compared to OCC1, OCC2,
and OCC3 (Fig. 4A). With respect to MMP, which is a
reflection of the ability of the ETC to generate a proton
gradient, Mitotracker Red MFIs for CD44+/MyD88+
EOC stem cell clones are likewise higher compared to
CD44-/MyD88- EOC cell clones (Fig. 4B). Therefore, the
dependence of EOC stem cells to glucose and its inability

the CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cells by down-regulated
expression, while in the differentiated CD44-/MyD88EOC cells it is regulated by inactivation/phosphorylation.
Finally, UCP2 levels are highly upregulated in the EOC
stem cells (Fig. 4D) further averting ATP production from
the established proton gradient. Taken together with the
data showing that EOC stem cells cannot sustain ATP
levels under glucose-limiting conditions, these results
suggest that in these chemoresistant cells, which possess a
significant amount of the organelle, mitochondrial function
is not primarily for the generation of ATP.

treated with Oligomycin (Fig. 5C) and although there
was an initial decrease in proliferation, these cells did not
lose viability in the presence of Oligomycin (Fig. 5D).
Taken together with the demonstration that EOC stem
cells cannot sustain ATP levels under glucose-limiting
conditions, this shows that OXPHOS indeed does not
contribute to ATP production in the EOC stem cells. In
contrast, in the CD44-/MyD88- EOC cells, a decrease in
ATP production is observed when these cells are treated
with DNP or Oligomycin (Fig. 5A,C). In addition,
prolonged treatment showed a decrease in viable cells in
the presence of DNP or Oligomycin (Fig. 5B,D). These
results suggest that differentiated EOC cells can generate
ATP from both glycolysis and OXPHOS and more
importantly that in contrast to the EOC stem cells, CD44-/
MyD88- EOC cells require OXPHOS to sustain growth.

Oxidative phosphorylation is dispensable for
EOC stem cell survival
To conclusively show that OXPHOS is dispensable
in the CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cells, we treated the
clones with the mitochondrial uncoupler, dinitrophenol
(DNP) and determined the effect on ATP production
and cell growth. We did not observe a decrease in ATP
in the CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cells until after the
8h treatment with DNP (Fig. 5A). In fact, a trend of
compensatory increase in ATP was observed, although
it was not sustained through time. Interestingly, when
followed for 24h, EOC stem cells did not lose viability but
instead had enhanced proliferation rate when treated with
DNP compared to Vehicle (Fig. 5B). We also determined
the effect of the ATP synthase inhibitor, Oligomycin.
Similarly, EOC stem cells did not show ATP loss when

IKKβ controls levels of Cox-I in ovarian cancer
cells
We then sought to identify a specific pathway
that may regulate the mitochondrial phenotype of the
EOC stem cells. We previously showed that in contrast
to the more differentiated CD44-/MyD88- EOC cells,
CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cells are characterized by
constitutive NFkB activity and constitutive secretion of
pro-inflammatory cytokines brought in part by high levels
of IKKβ [33, 34]. Previous studies have shown that NFκB
can control the glycolytic phenotype through regulation

of gene expression [35-37]. To determine if IKKβ/NFκB
has any influence on the metabolic phenotype of the
EOC stem cells, we performed transient transfection with
IKKβ siRNA on the EOC stem cells. Transient knockdown of IKKβ did not result in changes in mitochondrial
content nor MMP as detected by Mitotracker Green and
Mitotacker Red, respectively (data not shown). IKKβ
knock-down also did not result in any significant change in
the levels of secreted lactic acid (Fig. 6A) and in addition,
did not rescue the cells from death induced by glucose
deprivation (Fig. 6B). However, molecular analysis
showed a significant increase in the levels of Cox-I in the
EOC stem cells with IKKβ siRNA compared to control/
non-specific siRNA (Fig. 6C). We again demonstrated
the inverse correlation between IKKβ and Cox-I by overexpressing constitutively active IKKβ (pCMV-IKK2EE)
[33] in the classical ovarian cancer cell line, A2780.
A2780 cultures are negative for CD44 and MyD88 and do
not have constitutive NFkB activity [33]. We previously
showed that ectopic expression of pCMV- IKK2EE
in these cells is sufficient to induce secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and

MIP1-α [33]. Interestingly, this also results in a decrease
in Cox-I (Fig. 6D). Thus, IKKβ levels have an inverse
correlation with Cox-I in ovarian cancer cells. However,
IKKβ does not affect the other components of the electron
transport chain. This may explain the similar response
of control siRNA-transfected EOC stem cells and those
with transient IKKβ knock-down to glucose deprivation.
Taken together these results suggest that the bioenergetic
phenotype of EOC stem cells is controlled at multiple
levels and possibly regulated by multiple pathways.

Maintenance with 2-DG delays recurrence
Our final objective is to test the translational
application of our findings. In ovarian cancer, statistics
show that primary disease have an excellent response rate
to initial chemotherapy. However, as mentioned above, the
problem arises from the development of chemoresistant
recurrent disease. Since cancer stem cells represent
the more chemoresistant population and are thought to
contribute to recurrence, and since we show that glycolysis
inhibitors are potent inducers of cancer stem cell death,

Figure 6: IKKβ does not fully control glycolytic phenotype of EOC stem cells but is inversely correlated with Cox-I.

a potential strategy is to follow chemotherapy, which
targets differentiated cancer cells, with a maintenance
regimen of glycolysis inhibitors, which can in turn target
the remaining cancer stem cells. To test this hypothesis a
“recurrent” ovarian cancer xenograft model is required.
Our group recently described such a model. Intraperitoneal ovarian tumors are established in nude mice and
treated with Paclitaxel, which results in remission [38].
Cessation of chemotherapy at this point however, leads to
the development of recurrent disease, which is resistant to
second-round of Paclitaxel and thus mimics the clinical
profile of ovarian cancer patients. Using this model,
mice were treated with Paclitaxel and then randomly
reassigned into 2 groups: maintenance with saline
(Control) or maintenance with 2-DG. Our results show
that mice maintained in 2-DG had slower progression
to recurrence and decreased i.p. tumor burden compared
to control group (Fig. 7A). Analysis of tumors obtained
post-mortem recapitulates the biomarkers of response
observed in vitro. Tumor lysates from mice maintained in
2-DG show upregulated p-AMPK and LC3B-II compared
to mice maintained with saline (Fig. 7B). These results
support the possible benefit of adding glycolysis inhibitors
to standard chemotherapy with the goal of improving
survival in ovarian cancer patients.

cells can switch to OXPHOS under glucose limiting
conditions. In addition, they can upregulate the glycolysis
pathway if OXPHOS is inhibited demonstrating that
the two routes for ATP synthesis are functional in these
cells. In contrast, the inherently chemoresistant CD44+/
MyD88+ EOC stem cells are solely reliant on glucose for
survival since in these cells, multiple molecular blocks
are present that prevent ATP production via OXPHOS.
Consequently, since ATP can only be produced through
glycolysis, inhibition of the glycolytic pathway becomes
a potent route to induce cell death in these inherently
chemoresistant cancer cell population. Since ovarian
cancer mortality usually occurs in the recurrent setting
and given the potential role of cancer stem cells in the
promotion of recurrence, our study suggests the possible
value of maintenance treatment with glycolysis inhibitors
with the goal of improving patient survival.
Independence from OXPHOS can confer
advantages. Cancer stem cells are classically defined
as cancer cells that are able to self-renew and cause the
different lineages of cancer cells that comprise the tumor
[8, 10, 17, 18] . This definition requires the experimental
proof of tumor formation in immune-incompetent mice.
Since engraftment would require cells to survive at the
site of injection (s.c. or i.p.), which can be hypoxic,
independence from OXPHOS would therefore provide
an advantage. In addition, independence from OXPHOS
can support the process of sphere formation described in
several cancer stem cell models. Indeed, we previously
showed that the CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cells are able
to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and
mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) [39], which
are processes that are indispensable in the generation
of metastatic disease - a major contributor to ovarian
cancer mortality. Hypoxia can potently initiate EMT

DISCUSSION
We show in this study that in ovarian cancer,
heterogeneity is not only exemplified by tumor-initiating
potential or responsiveness to chemotherapy. There
is likewise diversity in the bioenergetic requirements
of the cancer cells that make up the tumor. The more
chemoresponsive CD44-/MyD88- EOC cells require
glucose for sustained proliferation but these differentiated

in the CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cells resulting in the
upregulation of the classical EMT inducer, Twist-1. Taken
together, two possible advantages can be inferred from the
observed bioenergetic phenotype of the EOC stem cells.
First, the lower levels of ETC components suggest lower
levels of oxygen requirement. Therefore, these cells may
not be as sensitive to transient hypoxia. Second, the full
reliance on glycolysis pathway for its ATP needs would
assure stable ATP levels during engraftment or during
the EMT-MET process, where oxygen may be extremely
limited, but glucose may be obtained from intracellular
glycogen stores.
Not all cancer cells exhibit the Warburg effect. In
some cancer cells OXPHOS is the major source of ATP
[40, 41] and in contrast to what was originally thought,
recent studies have demonstrated that the mitochondria
of some cancer cells are not damaged or mutated and
are able to contribute to ATP generation [42]. These
differences are probably reflections of the heterogeneity
in cancer cell types as well as differences in cellular state.
Indeed, Smolkova et al showed that controlled changes
in gene expression during the process of tumorigenesis
dynamically control OXPHOS activity [43]. This suggests
that a cell type may have a preferential pathway to
generate ATP under basal conditions but survival requires
the capacity to engage the other route of ATP production
under stress conditions. Our results show that this is not the
case for EOC stem cells. These cells are not able to switch
to OXPHOS when glucose levels are limiting and even
when OXPHOS substrates are provided. The inability of
CD44+/MyD88+ EOC stem cells to generate ATP through
OXPHOS is regulated in at least three levels: PDH, UCP2,
and the electron transport chain. Therefore, due to the low
levels of PDH, pyruvate cannot be utilized by the Citric
Acid cycle to generate reducing equivalents for the ETC.
This leaves the conversion of pyruvate to lactic acid as
the sole means to generate ATP. Even in conditions that
would support an epigenetic switch leading to a gain of
PDH, it can be inferred that the low baseline levels of
ETC components can function as the second-level block
since it may not be able to process the elevated levels of
reducing equivalents and instead may generate significant
amounts of reactive oxygen species. Finally, even when
PDH and ETC are not limited, generation of ATP can be
further inhibited in the EOC stem cells by UPC2, which
diverts the proton motive force away from ATP synthase.
It is important to note that the demonstration that EOC
stem cells have higher levels of UCP2 yet also have
higher MMP is not contradictory to what is currently
known about UCP2. Previous studies have demonstrated
UCP2 knock-down may further increase MMP [44] hence
suggesting that UCP2 activity may be depend on cell type
or cellular status.
The multiple levels of OXPHOS blockage
enumerated above may explain why EOC stem cells
cannot sustain ATP, and therefore undergo autophagic

cell death when glucose levels are limiting. More
importantly, these results suggest the value of glycolysis
inhibitors in targeting these chemoresistant cancer
cells. Since activation of alternative pathways is one of
the major causes of targeted therapy failure in vivo, the
demonstration that mitochondrial OXPHOS in EOC stem
cells is blocked at multiple levels indicates that switching
to OXPHOS when glucose is unavailable cannot be easily
accomplished.
The identification of the most optimal treatment
schedule is as important as finding an effective treatment
modality. The Warburg effect has been described for
decades but although its clinical impact has been useful
in diagnostics as demonstrated by the usefulness of PET
scans, its full translational effect in terms of therapies has
not been fully realized. Taken together with statistical
data that chemotherapy is effective in inducing remission
in patients with primary disease and that ovarian cancer
recurrence is driven at least in part by the CD44+/
MyD88+ EOC stem cells that survive chemotherapy, the
demonstration that EOC stem cells succumb to glycolysis
inhibitors suggests that the most optimal treatment
schedule is to give these inhibitors after the first-line
chemotherapy. Indeed, we demonstrate the efficacy of
2-DG given as maintenance in the recurrence setting.
2-DG given after chemotherapy decreases tumor burden
in the i.p. ovarian cancer xenograft model. It should
also be noted that cancer cells in general succumb to
glycolysis inhibitors more so than normal cells. Therefore
the demonstration that EOC stem cells are even more avid
towards glycolysis compared to the more differentiated
cancer cells suggests a wider therapeutic window. This is
extremely important since a narrow therapeutic window
has been the major limiting factor in using chemotherapy
to induce cell death in cancer stem cells.
Failure of specifically targeted treatments can be
mostly explained by activation of alternative pathways that
are redundant to the targeted pathway. This is especially
true for kinase inhibitors wherein inhibition of one specific
kinase deemed to be required for survival leads to the
activation of alternative kinase/s consequently inhibiting
efficacy of the treatment. In targeting bioenergetic
pathways, the use of glycolysis inhibitors can be made
ineffective by enhancing OXPHOS. Therefore the
demonstration that the chemoresistant EOC stem cells
are not able to utilize OXPHOS to generate ATP and that
this is blocked by at least three independent mechanisms
suggests the potential value of adding glycolysis inhibitors
to conventional chemotherapy. This approach may lead
to complete eradication of the tumor and may therefore
improve survival in ovarian cancer patients.

METHODS

Caspase activity assay
Total protein was extracted and measured as
previously described [46, 49]. Activity of caspase 3/7
and caspase 9 was quantified using Caspase Glo 3/7
and Caspase Glo 9, respectively (Promega) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Positive control for caspase
activation is lysate from the ovarian cancer cell line,
A2780 treated for 24h with 100 μg/ml carboplatin.

Cell cultures and conditions
OCSC1, OCSC2, OCSC5, OCSC6 (CD444+/
MyD88+ EOC stem cell clones) were purified from
patients diagnosed with serous EOC and thus each clone
is from a different patient. OCC1 and OCC2 (CD44-/
MyD88- EOC clones) are derived from OCSC1 and
OCSC2, respectively by in vitro differentiation [20] and
have similar characteristics as CD44-/MyD88- EOC cells
isolated from primary tumors. OCC3 (CD44-/MyD88EOC clone) was also obtained from a patient with serous
EOC. Cells were isolated and cultured as previously
described in these previous publications [20, 21, 33,
34, 38, 39, 45-48]. Purity of the EOC stem cell cultures
based on CD44 expression (100% expression) was tested
before each experiment by flow cytometry. Cells are never
passed beyond 10 passages for any of the experiments. For
each passage, in addition to CD44 levels, expression of
MyD88 and other stemness associated markers previously
described for these clones (including Oct-4 and Nanog)
[20, 33, 45] are determined by western blot analysis and
quantitative PCR. All sample collection described in this
study were performed with patient consent and approved
by the Human Investigation Committee of Yale University
School of Medicine. High glucose Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY),
with 25 mM of D-glucose was used to culture clones in
glucose-enriched conditions. No glucose Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (Life Technologies) was used to
culture clones in glucose-free conditions.

Western blot analysis
SDS-PAGE and Western blots were performed
using 20 ug of total protein lysate as previously described
[46, 49]. Antibodies used were: rabbit anti-LC3B (Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), rabbit anti-phospho
AMPK (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), rabbit
anti-actin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MI), Mitoprofile
Total OXPHOS Human WB antibody cocktail (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA), rabbit anti-pyruvate dehyrogenase (Cell
Signaling Technology), rabbit anti phospho-pyruvate
dehyrogenase E1 (S293) (Abcam) and anti-rabbit UCP2
(Abcam).

Quantification of ATP
ATP was quantified from live cells using CellTiterGlo Luminescent Assay (Promega) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Data was normalized to cell
number.

Quantification of lactic acid

Reagents and treatment

Lactic acid was quantified from cell-free
culture supernatants using Lactate Colorimetric Assay
Kit II (Biovision, Inc.. Milpitas, CA) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Data was normalized to cell
number.

2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) was purchased from Tocris
Bioscience (Bristol, UK) and used at 20 mM. Dimethyl
succinate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO) and used at 20 mM. Dinitrophenol was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used at 1 mM.

Determination of mitochondrial mass and
mitochondrial membrane potential

Determination of cell growth, morphology, and
viability

Mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial membrane
potential were determined by flow cytometry using
Mitotracker Green FM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
and Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) as
previously described [21]. Flow cytometry data were
acquired using BD FACSCalibur and analyzed using
CellQuest (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Growth curves and cellular morphology were
assessed using Incucyte (Essen Instruments, Ann Arbor,
MI), a kinetic live cell imaging system. Proliferation was
measured through quantitative kinetic processing metrics
derived from time-lapse image acquisition and presented
as percentage of culture confluence over time. Effect of
treatment on cell viability was quantified using Celltiter96
Aqueous One Solution Proliferation Assay (Promega,
Madison, WI).

Recurrent ovarian cancer xenograft model,
treatment schedule, and in vivo imaging
The Yale University Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee approved all in vivo studies described. The
intraperitoneal (i.p) recurrent ovarian cancer xenograft
model was established as previously described [38, 50]
using OCSC1-F2 cells stably expressing the mCherry
fluorescent tag. Paclitaxel was given i.p. at 12 mg/kg q3d
and afterwards mice were randmomized into 2 groups:
(1) Maintenance with saline as control, n = 10 and
maintenance with 2-DG, n= 4. 2-DG was given at 500 mg/
kg i.p. qd. Tumor growth was monitored by live in vivo
animal imaging using FX PRO (Bruker Corp., Billerica,
MA) and using mCherry fluorescence as surrogate for
tumor burden.
