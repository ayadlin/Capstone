Abstract
Molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying resistance/low responsiveness to antiangiogenic compounds are under extensive investigations. Both populations of tumor and stroma (nontumor compartment)
seem to contribute in inherent/acquired resistance to antiangiogenic therapy. Here, investigating in vivo
efficacy of sunitinib in experimental models resulted in the identification of tumors that were resistant/
sensitive to the therapy. Analysis of tumor protein lysates indicated a greater concentration of hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) in resistant tumors than in sensitive ones. In addition, using flow cytometry, c-Met
expression was found to be significantly higher in endothelial cells than in tumor cells, suggesting that HGF
might target the vascular endothelial cells in resistant tumors. Combination of sunitinib and a selective c-Met
inhibitor significantly inhibited tumor growth compared with sunitinib or c-Met inhibitor alone in resistant
tumors. Histology and in vitro analyses suggested that combination treatment mainly targeted the vasculature in the resistant tumors. Conversely, systemic injection of HGF in the sensitive tumor models conferred
resistance to sunitinib through maintenance of tumor angiogenesis. In conclusion, our study indicates a role
for HGF/c-Met pathway in development of resistance to antiangiogenic therapy and suggests a potential
strategy to circumvent resistance to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor in
the clinic. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10090–100. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Members of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
signaling pathway play a key role in both physiologic and
pathologic angiogenesis; hence, recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of bevacizumab (an anti-VEGF
monoclonal antibody) opened a new era in cancer therapy
(1). In addition to blocking the ligand, several receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) targeting VEGF pathway such
as sunitinib and sorafenib are also FDA approved or are being
tested in different stages of clinical trials (2). However, despite
showing efficacy and survival benefit in multiple treatment
settings, the majority of patients will eventually exhibit disease
progression while on therapeutic regimen. Molecular and
cellular mechanisms responsible for disease progression
and resistance are under extensive investigation. From angio-

genesis standpoint, several studies have suggested that both
tumor cells and stroma (nontumor compartment mainly
consisting of fibroblasts, pericytes, myeloid cells, and
mesenchymal stem cells) contribute to the development of
resistance to antiangiogenic therapy through activation of
alternative angiogenic factors such as FGF-2 [fibroblast
growth factor (3)], Bv8 [Bombina variegata (4)], and PDGF
[platelet-derived growth factor (5)].
The HGF/SF (hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor)/
c-Met pathway is known to play a significant role in different
stages of development and also in tumorigenesis (6). Although
HGF is enriched in cells of mesenchymal origin, c-Met is highly
expressed in epithelial cells. In addition, c-Met is broadly
expressed in several other cell types including endothelial
cells, neural cells, hematopoietic cells, and pericytes. Expression of c-Met and HGF has also been identified in the vast
majority of solid tumors (7). Activation of c-Met results in
proliferation, survival, and also increased invasiveness of
tumor cells through several other signaling pathways such
as PIK3/Akt, Src, STAT3, and Ras/Mek (8, 9). In the vasculature, c-Met activation, through paracrine HGF, regulates
tumor angiogenesis mainly by induction of proliferation,
migration, and survival of endothelial cells resulting in vascular tubulogenesis and branching morphogenesis (10). HGF
treatment in human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) results in the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues
in cytoplasmic domain of c-Met (11, 12). HGF promotes
angiogenesis through upregulation of VEGF (a key angiogenic

inducer) and also via downregulating thrombospondin-1
expression, (a potent angiogenic inhibitor (13). Similar to
VEGF, expression of both c-Met and HGF is induced by
hypoxia-inducible factor 1a, further providing a role for cMet/HGF in adverse microenvironment conditions to assist
angiogenesis, cell survival, and invasion (14, 15). Consistent
with these observations, clinical findings indicate that activation of c-Met pathway is a poor prognostic factor in cancer
patients (16–18). However, a full understanding of the role of
HGF in tumor angiogenesis and particularly in mediating
resistance to VEGF inhibitors remains to be determined.
In the present study, we tested the efficacy of sunitinib in
preclinical models and identified tumors that were resistant or
sensitive to the therapy. Analysis of protein lysates in the
resistant or sensitive tumors found a greater expression for
HGF in resistant tumors. Combination treatment using a
highly selective c-Met inhibitor, PF-04217903 (19) and sunitinib, provided additive effect in inhibiting tumor growth
compared with either a single agent. These results indicated
a functional role for HGF/c-Met axis in the sunitinib-resistant
tumors.

Materials and Methods
Tumor implantations and treatments
Nude mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar
Harbor, ME) or Charles Rivers Laboratories (Wilmington, MA)
and were maintained under guidelines provided by the Pfizer
IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee). All the
tumor cell lines (B16F1, EL4, LLC, and Tib6) in the current
study were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection
(ATCC; Manassas, VA) and were cultured in RPMI 1640
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with glutamine
(2 mmol/L) and fetal bovine serum (FBS; 10%). All the cell
lines in the current study were authenticated by the supplier
(20). For implantation, tumor cells (1  106 cells per mouse)
were resuspended in 100 mL of media and 100 mL of matrigel
growth factor reduced (BD BioSciences, San Jose, CA) and
were subcutaneously implanted in one of the flanking areas.
Tumor-bearing mice were treated once daily with sunitinib
malate at 80 mg/kg or PF-04217903 (45 mg/kg) or the combination of both compounds, using oral route of administration.
Tumors volumes were assessed using caliper measurement as
described (21). HUVECs and C166 cells were purchased from
Lonza Inc. (Lonza, CA) and ATCC, respectively. For in vitro
assays, HUVECs were grown in EBM2 media supplemented
with a cocktail of growth factors provided by the supplier
(Lonza Inc.), and C166 were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen)
supplemented with FBS (10%).
Histology
Formalin-fixed tumors were embedded in paraffin and were
cut (4 mm) using a cryostat machine. Tumor sections were
stained with mouse anti-CD31 antibody (BD BioSciences),
using DAB immunostaining protocol in the laboratory. To
quantify vascular surface area (VSA), images of tumors at 20
magnification were taken from each slide and each treatment.
Next, areas of CD31þ cells were highlighted and pixels were

www.aacrjournals.org

quantified using Image-Pro software (MediaCybernetics,
Bethesda, MD). Vascular density was calculated by dividing
the CD31 pixels to the pixels from total area of the image.
ELISA
Tumors samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and
were kept at 70 C. Total protein from each sample was
extracted and was quantified using bicinchoninic acid protein
assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Levels of HGF and total Met in the
tumors and serums were measured by ELISA kits (R&D
System, San Jose, CA), using protocols provided by the manufacturer. Similar methodology was applied to measure levels
of HGF in the conditioned media (CM) or in the tumor lysates.
Flow cytometry
Single-cell suspensions were provided from the tumors by
mechanical disruption, followed by RBC lysis using RBC lysis
buffer (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) were also provided by lysing RBCs
using RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience). Both tumor cells and
PBMNCs were stained with anti-mouse CD11b-APC (BD
Biosciences) and anti-mouse Gr1-PE (BD Biosciences) for
30 minutes at 4 C, followed by washing twice with PBS-FBS
(3%). The stained samples were analyzed in a FACSCalibur
machine (BD Bioscience) and frequency of CD11bþGr1þ cells
in the tumors and blood were analyzed using Cell Quest (BD
Biosciences) or FCS Express (De Novo Inc, Lake Forest, CA)
software. Similarly, to measure c-Met expression at the cell
surface, in vitro–grown cell lines and endothelial cells were
stained with PE-conjugated anti-mouse c-Met (eBioscience).
To exclude dead cells from the analysis, cells were stained with
7-amino-actinomycin D (BD Biosciences) prior to analysis on
a calibur machine.
In vitro assays
Cell lines, including B16F1, Tib6, EL4, and LLC, and
endothelial cells, HUVECs and C166, were seeded at 104 cells
in each well of 24-well tissue culture–treated plates. Cells were
grown in the standard media as described earlier. Cells were
treated with different concentrations (2, 0.2, and 0.02 mmol/L)
of sunitinib, PF-04217903, and combination of both compounds for 4 days. Efficacy of the compounds was measured
by counting cells in a Coulter counter machine (BD Biosciences). Similar approach was applied to evaluate the role of
HGF or VEGF on cell proliferation, using 3 different concentrations (10, 100, and 200 ng/mL) of each ligand.
HGF purification
For HGF expression and purification, S114 cells [NIH3T3
cells transfected with the human HGF and Met (22)] were first
cultured in suspension in PFHM II medium (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 2.5% FBS to a density of 2  106/mL.
The cells were then harvested and washed once with PFHM II
medium and resuspended in PFHM II at 0.5  106/mL to
culture for 96 hours. Next, the supernatant was collected from
the growing cultures (1.6  106/mL with 95% viability) by
centrifugation and was concentrated 26-fold in a Sartocon
slice cassette (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Aubagne, France)

with a 10-kD cutoff in a cross-flow system. Concentrated
supernatant was filtered and applied to a HiPrep 16/10
Heparin FF column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with PBS
(pH ¼ 7.4). The unbound materials were depleted by washing
the column with PBS twice. HGF was then eluted with a linear
gradient of NaCl (0.3–2 mol/L in 1 PBS, 10 column volume)
at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Eluted fractions were analyzed by
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and Western blot, using anti-a-HGF antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). HGF-containing fractions
were pooled and concentrated to about 1 mg/mL with an
Amicon centrifugal filter device. Levels of endotoxin in the
eluted HGF/SF were reduced to less than 5 EU/mg and the
purified HGF was stored at 80 C.

Results
Modes of tumor response to sunitinib in experimental
models
Several studies have extensively investigated mechanisms of
tumors un/low responsiveness to antiangiogenic therapy in
preclinical tumor models. Recent investigation identified
populations of murine cell lines that are sensitive/refractory
to treatment with anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (mAb)
(23). It was also documented that response to an anti-VEGF
mAb is independent of functional B or T cells, as a similar
profile of responsiveness to treatment was observed in immunodeficient mice. To focus our efforts on tumor responsiveness to small molecule inhibitors, we sought to investigate
sunitinib efficacy in several murine tumor models including
B16F1 (melanoma), Tib6 (plasmacytoma), EL4 (lymphoblastic), and LLC (Lewis lung carcinoma) tumors. These studies
were initiated in immunodeficient mice (nu/nu) to minimize
role of a particular strain of mouse in tumor growth and
progression. We administered sunitinib malate at 80 mg/kg,
which is projected to result in inhibition of VEGFR and RTK
target coverage comparable with clinically utilized dose regimens at 37.5 or 50 mg every day.
As illustrated in Figure 1, although B16F1 (Fig. 1A) and Tib6
(Fig. 1B) tumors were sensitive to sunitinib, EL4 (Fig. 1C) and
LLC (Fig. 1D) tumors exhibited resistant to the therapy shortly
after the initiation of treatment. These results are in agreement with previous reports investigating efficacy of an antiVEGF mAb in the same cell lines (23, 24), indicating a similar
trend in tumor responsiveness in anti-VEGF versus small
molecule inhibitors of VEGF pathway.
In addition to VEGF pathway, several other signaling pathways, such as PDGF-RB receptor, CSF-1R (colony stimulating
factor), and c-kit pathways (25), are targeted by sunitinib. To
understand whether the inhibition of these additional pathways by sunitinib plays a role in responsiveness to the therapy,
we compared efficacy of sunitinib versus axitinib [a selective
VEGF inhibitor (26)] in resistant tumors (Fig. 1E and F).
Interestingly, sunitinib and axitinib demonstrated a statistically indistinguishable effect on tumor growth in both EL4
(Fig. 1E) and LLC (Fig. 1F), as neither tumor responded to the
therapies. Similarly, both sensitive tumors were nearly equally
responsive to axitinib and sunitinib (Supplementary Fig. 1A

10092

and B). Therefore, with the exception of VEGF, which is
targeted by both sunitinib and axitinib, other sunitinib-targeted pathways such as PDGF-RB, CSF-1R, and c-kit do not
appear to contribute in tumors response to these RTKIs in the
models utilized in the current study. Overall, these efforts
identified differential response to sunitinib among several
murine lines and provided a reason to investigate alternative
angiogenic pathway(s) in the resistant tumors to apply combination treatment.
HGF is enriched in the stroma in resistant tumors and
mainly targets endothelial cells
We decided to further focus on the mechanisms of
resistance to sunitinib as it is in further advanced stages
of clinical trials compared to axitinib (27). Given the
significance of c-Met in tumor progression (explained in
the Introduction section), we fully concentrated our efforts
to understand whether HGF/c-Met plays a role in the
development of resistance to sunitinib. To provide a rationale to pursue the role of the c-Met pathway in resistant
tumors, we first measured levels of HGF in both sera and
tumors in all the models. ELISA data showed a gradual
reduction in HGF concentration in the serum from non–
tumor-bearing mice to all tumor-bearing mice, suggesting
that HGF is highly concentrated in the tumors and is not
extensively released to the blood circulation (Fig. 2A). This
is consistent with another proangiogenic factor, PDGF,
which is highly enriched in the tumors but is minimally
released into the blood circulation (24). HGF levels in the
tumors (Fig. 2B), however, were significantly (P < 0.05)
higher in resistant tumors than in sensitive ones, particularly in the sunitinib-treated mice. These data indicate that
greater concentration of HGF might be associated with
resistance to sunitinib. To identify source of HGF in the
tumors, we measured levels of HGF protein in all the cell
lines as well as endothelial cells, HUVECs and C166, a
mouse yolk sac endothelial cells (28), in both normoxic
(20% O2) and hypoxic conditions (1% O2). Our data demonstrated that irrespective of oxygen concentration, neither
tumor nor endothelial cells were enriched in HGF, suggesting that stromal compartment might be a major source of
HGF in the tumor mass (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, and consistent with human fibroblast cell lines [Mrc5 (29), NIH3T3
cells found to be highly enriched in HGF in both protein
lysates and CM. An increase in HGF levels in NIH3T3-CM
compared with NIH3T3-lysate may indicate that extracellular HGF might be a main determinant of HGF concentration and activity in the tumors. HGF expression in the
tumor stroma is also consistent with histologic analyses in
several studies, indicating localization of HGF to stromal
cells in multiple tumor types (30, 31).
As of one of the major components of stroma, hematopoietic cells (originating from the bone marrow) are a major
source of proangiogenic factors such as Bv8 (4). To determine
whether BMMNCs are enriched for HGF, we isolated these
cells from naive as well as from tumor-bearing mice and
further fractionated them into subsets of CD11b-enriched
and CD11b-depleted cells with high purity (Supplementary

of c-Met (P < 0.05), indicating that vasculature might be the
major target for HGF in the tumor mass (Fig. 2D). To provide
functional relevance for greater expression of c-Met, we
investigated tumor/endothelial cell proliferation. In vitro
treatment of endothelial and tumor cells with different
concentrations of HGF and VEGF showed that neither
molecule affected cellular proliferation in the tumor cells
(Fig. 3A). Conversely, both growth factors promoted proliferation of endothelial cells, providing additional rationale
that the vasculature might be main a target of HGF in the
tumors (Fig. 3B).
Combination of sunitinib and PF-04217903 has additive
effect in growth inhibition in the resistant tumors
The in vitro analysis of tumor and endothelial cells provided
a strong rationale to test in vivo efficacy of combination
treatment, using sunitinib and PF-04217903 [a highly selective
c-Met inhibitor (19)], in the resistant tumors. As illustrated in
Figure 4A and B, PF-04217903 monotherapy did not inhibit
tumor growth in any of the sensitive tumors, indicating a lack
of activation of c-Met pathway in either vasculature or tumor
cell compartments in these models. Furthermore, there was
no significant difference in tumor growth in the combination
treatment versus sunitinib monotherapy in B16F1- (Fig. 4A)
and Tib6 (Fig. 4B)-sensitive tumors, suggesting a lack of
contribution of c-Met pathway in these tumors. However,
growth of both resistant tumors (EL4, Fig 4C; LLC, Fig. 4D)
was significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited by the combination
regimen compared with either single-agent regimen, indicat-

ing a role for c-Met activation, possibly through paracrine
HGF, in these tumors. In addition, combination therapy was
efficacious in resistant tumors when treatment started in
established tumors (data not shown).
To understand the mechanism of tumor growth inhibition
for the combination regimen, vasculature was analyzed in
both sensitive and resistant tumors (Fig. 5A). In the sensitive
tumors, sunitinib significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the vascular
density, as measured by CD31-positive areas, compared with
the vehicle-treated tumors. However, combination treatment
did not change vascular density in sunitinib as single agent
versus the combination regimen. PF-04217903 monotherapy
did not significantly alter the vasculature in either sensitive or
resistant tumors, further signifying the role of VEGF in promoting tumor growth and angiogenesis. In the resistant
tumors, sunitinib inhibited the vascular expansion compared
with the vehicle-treated tumors. In addition, combination
therapy significantly reduced VSAs compared with sunitinib
alone in the resistant tumors. To further investigate histologic
findings, we treated all the cell lines as well as endothelial cells
with different concentrations of sunitinib, PF-04217903, or the
combination of both compounds in vitro. As illustrated in
Figure 5B, although sunitinib and the combination significantly inhibited endothelial cells proliferation at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (0.2 and 0.02 mmol/L), tumor
cells were not affected by either the agent or the combination
(Fig. 5C). Together, histologic and in vitro data suggest that
targeting the vasculature is one of the mechanisms by which
combination treatment inhibits growth of resistant tumors.
We also studied kinetics of myeloid cells, identified by the
expression of CD11b and Gr1 (32), in both resistant and
sensitive tumors, as recent studies have suggested a role

plus PF-04217903) in sensitive or resistant tumors. Nude mice (n ¼ 6) were implanted with B16F1 (A), Tib6 (B), EL4 (C), and LLC (D) cells (1106 cells
per mouse). Treatments started a day after implantation, and tumors volumes were measured twice a week. Data are representative of 1 of 2 independent

for these cells in mediating refractoriness to VEGF inhibitors
(33). Myeloid cells have shown to be enriched in proangiogenic
factors such as Bv8, which promote tumor growth through
induction of both local angiogenesis and mobilization of
myeloid cells to the tumors. Therefore, it is important to
know whether treatment with sunitinib or combination
affects kinetics of myeloid cells in the tumors utilized in
the current study. Analysis of tumor-associated myeloid cells
indicated a greater (P < 0.05) frequency of these cells in the
resistant tumors than in the sensitive ones (Fig. 5D). This is in
agreement with previous reports, suggesting that resistant
tumors instruct the bone marrow to induce proliferation,
mobilization, and homing of myeloid cells to the tumors
(23). Interestingly, sunitinib seems to increase the frequency
of tumor-associated myeloid cells in both resistant tumors.
Therefore, greater frequency of myeloid cells may result in an
increase in HGF concentration in the tumor microenvironment. However, PF-04217903 alone or in combination with
sunitinib did not alter myeloid cell infiltration to the tumors,
indicating that HGF may not play a significant role in the
kinetics of these cells in the resistant tumors. Combined, our
data suggest that HGF/c-Met pathway may directly target the
vasculature in the resistant tumors.

HGF upregulation confers resistance to sunitinib in the
sensitive tumors
To further recapitulate the role of c-Met pathway in
development of resistance to sunitinib, and using a gainof-function approach, we hypothesized that HGF upregulation in sensitive tumors confers resistance to sunitinib.
Therefore, we treated mice bearing sensitive tumors with
systematic (intraperitoneal route) injection of purified HGF
(Fig. 6A and B). Treatment with sunitinib started 4 days after
implantation to allow sufficient exposure of tumor/endothelial cells to HGF, leading to the activation of c-Met pathway.
Similar to previous data (Figs. 1A and B and 4A and B), both
B16F1 or Tib6 tumors in mice that did not receive HGF were
sensitive to sunitinib treatment (Fig. 6A and B). However, the
B16F1 or Tib6 tumors treated with HGF did not respond to
sunitinib and showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) in
tumor volume compared with the corresponding sunitinibtreated population. To understand the mechanism of tumor
growth promotion in the sunitinib-treated tumors, we examined the vasculature in all the treatments. Analysis of sections of tumors stained with CD31 indicated an increased
vascular density (P < 0.05) in the sunitinib-treated tumors
cotreated with HGF versus tumors that did not receive HGF

HGF/c-Met as an Alternative Angiogenic Pathway in Sunitinib-Resistant Tumors

(Fig. 6C and D). Combined, these data further confirm a role
for HGF/c-Met pathway in development of resistance to
sunitinib via targeting the vasculature.

Discussion
Agents targeting tumor angiogenesis, particularly VEGF
inhibitors, have provided new cancer treatment options.
Similar to other anticancer agents, tumor recurrence has been
one of the major challenges in patients treated with angiogenesis inhibitors. Recent reports in preclinical models suggest
that activation of alternative angiogenic pathways in antiVEGF–treated tumors is one of the mechanisms of unresponsiveness to the therapy (34). In addition, 2 recent independent
studies suggested that antiangiogenic therapy may induce
tumor progression and metastasis due to increased invasiveness of tumor cells (35, 36). Overall, these observations have
emphasized further investigations to optimize application of
this class of agents in the clinical setting.
Here, we investigated modes of resistance to sunitinib,
which is clinically approved for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and imatinib-resistant or intolerant gastrointestinal
stromal tumor and is in several trials for other tumor types
including lung cancers (37, 38). Sunitinib efficacy in murine
lines in the current study, and in comparison with recent
reports (23, 24), indicates that blocking the receptor-mediated
signaling is as efficacious as blocking the ligand in inhibiting
tumor growth. Future studies may determine whether there
are distinct indications in preclinical models in blocking the
VEGF pathway versus inhibiting the ligand.
We focused our investigations on the c-Met pathway, as
several studies have pointed a significant role for this pathway
in development, tumorigenesis, and angiogenesis. In general, cMet pathway can be activated through: i) paracrine or autocrine
HGF, ii) amplification of c-Met gene locus, and iii) activating
mutations in the kinase domain of the c-Met receptor (37, 38).
Of note, our data in the present study suggest that c-Met is
activated through binding of HGF, as none of the cell lines
exhibited a notable response to different concentrations of cMet inhibitor in vitro or in vivo. Therefore, in our models, greater
concentration of HGF and/or proximal interaction of tumor
and stromal cells in a relatively hypoxic microenvironment are
critical for the activation of c-Met pathway in intact tumors.
Lack of HGF expression in tumor or endothelial cells signifies a role of stroma in the resistant tumors as a source of
HGF. Of the tumor stroma compartments, BMMNCs was found
to be an enriched source of HGF, though there was no significant difference in levels of HGF in non–tumor-bearing mice
versus tumor-bearing ones. There has been extensive focus on

the role of stromal cells in mediating resistance to angiogenic
inhibitors in preclinical models. For example, proangiogenic
factors, such as Bv8 (4, 39), PDGF-C (40), FGF-2 (3), and PlGF
(5), have been identified in different stromal compartment
including myeloid cells and tumor-associated fibroblasts.
Therefore, in addition to Bv8, HGF is also enriched in the
BMMNCs. Furthermore, flow cytometry data indicated a significant increase in the frequency of CD11bþGr1þ cells in the
resistant tumors, which is consistent with previous reports that
indicate an increase not only in the frequency but also in the
total number of these cells in the resistant tumors (24). Therefore, we hypothesize that even though there is marginal
difference in HGF level in the BMMNCs isolated from resistant
or sensitive tumors, greater infiltration of BMMNCs to the
resistant tumors provides more HGF to the vasculature than
that in sensitive ones (23). In addition, we observed a significant difference in the levels of secreted versus intracellular
HGF in NIH3T3 cells and therefore intracellular HGF may not
be a true representative of its bioavailability in the tumor
microenvironment. Future studies will test levels of secreted
HGF in BMMNCs isolated from resistant versus sensitive
tumors. Interestingly, the in vitro data indicate that although
both tumor and endothelial cells are exposed to HGF, only the
latter is capable of proliferation, providing a hypothesis that
angiogenesis is the main target of HGF in these tumors.
Assessment of myeloid population further confirms a direct
angiogenic role for HGF, as neither c-Met inhibition nor HGF
upregulation in the sensitive tumors affected kinetics of myeloid cells in the peripheral blood or in the tumors.
Overall, the current investigation unveils yet another molecular mechanism of resistance to VEGF inhibitors. Using a loss
of function (inhibition of c-Met pathway in the resistant
tumors) and a gain of function (upregulation of HGF in the
sensitive tumors) approach indicate a role for HGF in tumors
resistance to sunitinib. Future studies will determine whether
there is clinical application using combination treatment to
circumvent lack of response to VEGF RTKIs in cancer patients.
