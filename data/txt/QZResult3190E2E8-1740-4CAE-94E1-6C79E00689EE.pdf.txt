ABSTRACT
Purpose: Despite recent improvements in therapeutic management of
osteosarcoma, ongoing challenges in improving the response to chemotherapy
warrants new strategies still needed to improve overall patient survival. Among
new therapeutic approaches, zoledronic acid (ZOL) represents a promising adjuvant
molecule to chemotherapy to limit the osteolytic component of bone tumors. However,
ZOL triggers the elevation of heat shock proteins (Hsp), including Hsp27 and clusterin
(CLU), which could enhance tumor cell survival and treatment resistance. We
hypothesized that targeting CLU using siRNA or the antisense drug, OGX-011, will
suppress treatment-induced CLU induction and enhance ZOL-induced cell death in
osteosarcoma (OS) cells.
Methods: The combined effects of OGX-011 and ZOL were investigated in vitro on
cell growth, viability, apoptosis and cell cycle repartition of ZOL-sensitive or -resistant
human OS cell lines (SaOS2, U2OS, MG63 and MNNG/HOS).
Results: In OS cell lines, ZOL increased levels of HSPs, especially CLU, in
a dose- and time-dependent manner by mechanism including increased HSF1
transcription activity. The OS resistant cells to ZOL exhibited higher CLU expression
level than the sensitive cells. Moreover, CLU overexpression protects OS sensitive
cells to ZOL-induced cell death by modulating the MDR1 and farnesyl diphosphate
synthase expression. OGX-011 suppressed treatment-induced increases in CLU and
synergistically enhanced the activity of ZOL on cell growth and apoptosis. These
biologic events were accompanied by decreased expression of HSPs, MDR1 and HSF1
transcriptional activity. In vivo, OGX-011, administered 3 times a week (IP, 20mg/
kg), potentiated the effect of ZOL (s.c; 50µg/kg), significantly inhibiting tumor growth
by 50% and prolonging survival in MNNG/HOS xenograft model compared to ZOL
alone.
Conclusion: These results indicate that ZOL-mediated induction of CLU can
be attenuated by OGX-011, with synergistic effects on delaying progression of
osteosarcoma.

INTRODUCTION

treatment that collectively increase the apoptotic rheostat
of cancer cells. Usually, the molecular mechanisms
underlying resistance include overexpression of efflux
pumps, inhibition of apoptosis (overexpression of antiapoptotic members of the bcl-2 protein family), increased
DNA damage repair, and alteration of drug targets [17]
and cytoprotective chaperone networks [18, 19]. Indeed,
several cytoprotective chaperones such as Heat Shock
Protein-27 (Hsp27) or clusterin (CLU) are reported to play
a protective function in tumor cells under stress condition
such as conventional or targeted therapies [20, 21].
CLU is a heterodimeric stress-induced
cytoprotective chaperone that inhibits protein aggregation
in a manner analogous to small HSPs, and its promoter
contains a 14-bp element recognized by the transcription
factor HSF1 [22]. CLU is ubiquitously expressed but at
variable levels depending on many severe physiological
disturbances, including tumor formation. In human OS,
CLU levels are overexpressed in OS to a variable extent,
especially after conventional therapy and could be a
valuable marker of aggressive extraosseous osteosarcoma
[23]. Experimental and clinical studies associate CLU
with development of treatment resistance, where CLU
suppresses treatment-induced cell death in response to
conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapies or radiation
[19, 21, 24-27]. Overexpression of CLU in OS indicates
drug resistance to conventional therapies [23, 27] and
over-expression of CLU in prostate cancer cells accelerates
progression after hormone- or chemo-therapy [19, 24],
identifying CLU as an anti-apoptotic gene up-regulated by
treatment stress that confers therapeutic resistance. OGX011 is a second-generation phosphorothioate antisense
oligonucleotide currently in late stage clinical development
that potently inhibits CLU expression and enhances the
efficacy of anticancer therapies in various human cancers
[28, 29]. While targeting CLU synergistically enhances the
cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy, a role for CLU has not
been characterized in the context of ZOL treatment and
resistance.
In the present study, we set out the hypothesis
that ZOL induces a heat shock response with increased
HSF1 activity and subsequently CLU expression, which
functions as inhibitor of treatment-induced apoptosis,
enhancing emergence of treatment resistance. Based on
these data, knockdown of CLU using OGX-011 could
potentiate the effect of zoledronic acid in osteosarcoma
treatment.

Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary
malignant bone tumor in both children and young adults
with a peak of incidence at 18 years [1, 2]. The tumor
generally develops on the average part of the long bones
(femur and tibia), at the vicinity of an articulation, mainly
the knee or the shoulder. Current therapeutic protocols
consist in neoadjuvant poly-chemotherapy associated
with conservative surgery. The long-term survival rate
is 60% to 75% at 5 years for patients with localized
tumor but drastically goes down to 25% if pulmonary
metastases are detected at diagnosis. However, patients
who do not respond to these conventional therapies have
a poor prognosis. To significantly improve survival in
children with OS, new therapeutic strategies targeting
the molecular basis of OS and treatment resistance are
required.
Zoledronic acid (ZOL), the second generation of
nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs), represents
a promising alternative to treat OS. N-BPs are stable
synthetic analogues of endogenous pyrophosphate (PPi)
[3]. N-BPs induces osteoclast apoptosis by inhibiting
enzymes of the mevalonate pathway, especially farnesyl
diphosphate synthase (FDPs) [4, 5]. ZOL is one of the
most potent inhibitors of bone resorption in clinical use
to treat osteoporosis and other osteoclast-mediated bone
diseases such as primary bone tumors. Moreover, several
studies using bisphosphonates especially N-BPs, have
demonstrated promising results by selectively targeting
OS tumor cells [6-8]. We have previously shown that
ZOL is able to delay tumor progression, to prevent
tumor relapse compared with chemotherapy alone and
to prevent osteolytic lesions in preclinical models of OS
[9]. Our results have provided the rationale supporting the
French randomized phase III clinical protocol OS2006
(Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00470223), which combines ZOL
with conventional therapy for adult and pediatric patients.
Since then, other fundamental or preclinical studies have
confirmed the beneficial effect of BPs in OS [6, 10, 11].
Indeed, ZOL directly affects the proliferation and survival
of OS tumor cells in vitro [6, 12-14], making of ZOL an
attractive therapy for the treatment of OS, targeting both
tumor cells and bone microenvironment.
However, ZOL as a potential clinical application
suggests an extensive and prolonged contact of cancer
cells with this N-BP, which is localized and stored in
tumor-bone microenvironment [15]. This continued
exposure could increase the risk of resistance development
[16]. Indeed, despite the widely use of bisphosphonates
in the clinical management of cancer, few studies have
reported ZOL-resistance development in cancer cells and
that deserve to be explored. Development of treatment
resistance is a common feature of most malignancies and
the underlying basis for most cancer deaths. Treatment
resistance evolves, at least, from selective pressures of

3 weeks of treatment (Fig. 1A), suggesting that ZOL
treatment induced a stress response characterized by
this increase of CLU expression. In addition, increased
expression of CLU is durable 7 days after ZOL withdrawal
(Supp. Fig. 1).
To confirm these in vivo results, dose-dependent
effects of ZOL on the expression of CLU mRNA and
protein levels were evaluated in a panel of human
osteosarcoma cell lines (MNNG/HOS, MG63 and
SaOS2). ZOL significantly increased CLU mRNA level
in a dose-dependent manner depending of the tumor cell
lines (Fig. 1B). CLU protein levels also increased in a
dose-dependent manner after ZOL treatment in all tested
osteosarcoma cell lines, as analyzed by western-blotting
(Fig. 1C).

Zoledronic acid induces expression of clusterin in
osteosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo
First we assessed the effects of ZOL treatment on
CLU expression in vivo in HOS-MNNG osteosarcoma
xenografts using immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1A). Once
tumors became palpable, mice were treated with ZOL
and tumors were harvested for immunohistochemical
analysis. While ZOL rapidly and significantly induced
CLU expression (18h after treatment; Supp. Fig.1), CLU
expression increased 2.5-fold after treatment with ZOL
(***, p<0.001) compared with vehicle treated tumor after

paratibial site. Once tumors were palpable, mice were randomly assigned to vehicle (PBS) or ZOL (50ug/kg, s.c.) three times per week for 3
weeks. Tumors were collected after 3 weeks and CLU expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis. Specimens were scored
and estimated in % positive cells. B, human OS cells (MG63, MNNG/HOS and SaOS2) were treated with ZOL at the indicated doses for
48h. C, mRNA extracts were analyzed by real-time PCR for CLU. Protein extracts were analyzed by western blotting for CLU and vinculin
expression. All experiments were repeated at least three times. ***, p<0.001; ** p<0.01.

ZOL-resistant cells overexpress CLU and CLU
overexpression protects osteosarcoma tumor cells
from ZOL inhibitory effect

showing that these cells became completely resistant to
ZOL at the tested doses. The same results were obtained
with HOS-MNNG-R cells (Supp. Fig. 2A). Then, we
observed that MG63R exhibited a higher CLU expression
at both RNA and protein level than MG63 sensitive cells
(Fig. 2B), suggesting an association between CLU levels
and the resistance to ZOL in OS cells.
Then, we tried to re-sensitize resistant cells to
ZOL treatment by knocking down CLU using OGX-011
antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), a specific CLU inhibitor
(Fig. 2C and D). First we observed that MG63R cells (in
red) treated with control ScrB are still resistant to ZOL
treatment compared with MG63 sensitive cells treated
with ScrB ASO (in green; Fig. 2C). However, CLU
inhibition using OGX-011 significantly but partially resensitzed MG63R tumor cells (in blue) to ZOL inhibitory
effect by decreasing cell viability by 25% compared with
MG63R treated with ScrB ASO (Fig. 2C). Moreover,
MG63 sensitive cells treated with OGX-011 (in violet) are
more sensitive to ZOL treatment than the MG63 sensitive

As CLU is overexpressed after ZOL treatment and is
known to confer resistance to treatment in various cancers,
we hypothesized that CLU could be involved in the
emergence and maintenance of resistance of osteosarcoma
cells to ZOL treatment. Based on this hypothesis, MG63
and HOS-MNNG tumor cells were cultured in presence
of increasing concentration of ZOL for 6 months to obtain
ZOL-resistant cells, called MG63R and HOS-MNNG-R
cells. After this time, the selected cells were ‘pooled’, in
order to avoid clonality. We first compared the sensitivity
of MG63 and HOS-MNNG sensitive cells versus MG63R
and HOS-MNNG-R cells in presence of ZOL. While ZOL
treatment significantly inhibited cell viability of MG63
sensitive cells in a dose-dependent manner, no significant
effect was observed on MG63R (Fig. 2A, right panel),

Figure 2: CLU induced by ZOL treatment protects tumor cells and leads to ZOL resistance. MG63 cells were treated with

increased doses of ZOL for 6 months to become resistant to ZOL (MG63R or MG63 resist.). After this time, the selected cells were ‘pooled’,
in order to avoid clonality. A, MG63R and MG63 were treated with ZOL for the indicated doses for 48h. Cell growth was determined by

cells treated with ScrB ASO (in green), suggesting a
benefit effect of combination of OGX-011 with ZOL
by inhibiting CLU expression (Fig. 2C and D). These
results were confirmed by clonogenic assay in MG63
and HOS-MNNG resistant cells (Supp. Fig. 2B). These
results suggest that CLU is involved in the emergence of

resistance to ZOL. Moreover, CLU knock-down prevents
this emergence of resistance and enhance ZOL activity to
inhibit OS cell growth.
Confirming the idea that CLU confers resistance
to ZOL, we then transiently overexpressed CLU in
osteosarcoma cells. CLU mRNA and protein levels

were analyzed osteosarcoma cells (Supp. Fig. 2C). CLU
mRNA expression was significantly increased to 4.5fold compared to control cells and confirmed by western
blot analysis (Supp. Fig. 2C). Then, the response to ZOL
treatment was evaluated in these osteosarcoma CLUoverexpressed cells versus the control cells by a cell
viability assay. While control cells responded to ZOL
treatment in a dose-dependent manner, ZOL decreased
also the cell viability in a dose-dependent manner in cells
CLU-overexpressing cells (Supp. Fig. 2C). However, cells
CLU-overexpressed cells were significantly less sensitive
to ZOL treatment than the control cells, demonstrating that
CLU overexpression protects osteosarcoma cells to ZOLinduced cytotoxicity (Supp. Fig. 2C).

MDR1 and FDPs [32], as observed in MG63R tumor cells
compared with MG63 sensitive cells (Fig. 3A, middle
and right panel) and in HOS-MNNG-R compared with
HOS-MNNG sensitive cells (Supp. Fig. 3D). Surprisingly,
this increase of MDR1 and FDPs expressions correlates
with the increase of CLU expression in MG63R cells.
Moreover, overexpression of CLU in MG63 cells
also leads to significant increase of MDR1 and FDPs
expressions (Fig. 3B, middle panel), suggesting that CLU
could regulate MDR1 and FDPs expressions. MDR1 is
reported to be transcriptionally regulated directly by HSF1
with the presence of HSE sequence in MDR1 promoter
[33], and we effectively confirm that HSF1 knockdown
using siRNA significantly reduced MDR1 expression
while FDPs expression was not affected (Supp. Fig. 3E).
Interestingly, CLU inhibition using OGX-011 significantly
reduced MDR1 expression in MG63R, but did not affect
FDPs expression at transcriptional level compared with
MG63R treated with ScrB ASO (Fig. 3D, left panel),
while both FDPs and MDR1 expressions were decreased
at protein level (Fig. 3D, right panel). All these results
suggest that CLU indirectly regulates MDR1 expression at
transcriptional level by regulating HSF1 activity (Fig. 3C).
However, CLU inhibition does not affect FDPs expression
at transcriptional level but seems to regulate FDPs at
protein level probably by its chaperone activity.

CLU regulates the resistance phenotype of
osteosarcoma cells
Because HSF1 is a master regulator of the heat
shock response [30], we then evaluate the effect of ZOL
treatment on HSF1 activity and HSPs expression. First,
we used the Heat Shock Element (HSE) reporter designed
to monitor the activity of heat shock response through
measuring the transcriptional activity of HSF1, leading to
induction of Hsps and CLU expression. We first verified
that overexpression of HSF1 increased HSE luciferase
activity (Supp. Fig. 3A). Moreover, it is well known that
exposure of cells to elevated temperatures such as 42°C
activates HSF1 binding to HSE, which induces HSF1driven reporter activity (Supp. Fig 3B). Then, we found
that ZOL significantly induced HSE luciferase activity
suggesting that ZOL increased HSF1 transcriptional
activity (Fig. 3A, left panel) and CLU expression (Fig.
1). In MG63R cells, enhanced CLU expression is
accompanied with increased-expression level of Hsp27
compared with MG63 sensitive cells (Fig. 3A, middle
panel), suggesting an increase of heat shock response
induced by HSF1.
We know that CLU overexpression protects tumor
cells from ZOL-induced cell death (Supp. Fig. 2C), and
we found that overexpression of CLU also increased
HSF1 activity in a dose dependant-manner (Fig. 3B, left
panel) followed by increase of Hsp27 expression (Fig. 3B,
middle panel), without affecting HSF1 expression (Fig.
3B, right panel). Moreover, CLU knockdown using OGX011 significantly decreased HSF1 transcriptional activity
(Fig. 3C) without affecting HSF1 expression (Fig. 3D,
right panel), which was also confirmed by using specific
siRNA targeting CLU (Supp. Fig. 3C), while knock-down
of HSF1 using siRNA decreased CLU expression (Supp.
Fig. 3C). All These data suggest a feed-forward regulation
of HSF1 by CLU as we previously reported in prostate
cancer [31].
Resistance to ZOL treatment involves different
biological processes including increase expression of

OGX-011 enhances ZOL induced apoptosis in
osteosarcoma cell lines
Since ZOL induces up-regulation of CLU and CLUfunctions as mediator in treatment resistance [28, 29, 34],
we next evaluated whether CLU knockdown potentiated
the effect of ZOL treatment. To determine whether this
effect was additive or synergistic, the dose-dependent
effects with constant ratio design and the combination
index (CI) values were performed and calculated
according to the Chou and Talalay median effect
principal [35]. Figure 4A shows the dose response curve
(combination treatment, OGX-011 or ZOL monotherapy)
and the combination index plots, indicating that OGX011 synergistically enhances the effect of ZOL on HOSMNNG tumor cell growth (Fig. 4A). These results were
confirmed in MG63, SaOS2 and U2OS cells (Supp. Fig.
4).
Then we performed a colony formation assay to
evaluate capabilities to recover after 2 days of OGX011 +/-ZOL treatment. While neither OGX-011 nor ZOL
did not change the number of colonies compared with
control ScrB ASO (Fig. 4B), the combination of OGX11 with ZOL significantly decreased the colony formation
compared with each single drug alone (Fig. 4B).
Moreover, OGX-011 potentiates the effect of ZOL
inhibitor to induce apoptosis (Fig. 4C and D). Flow
cytometric analysis shows that apoptotic rates (subG1

is combined with ZOL (38.4%) compared to control ScrB
(1.8%), OGX-011 (10.8%), control ScrB ASO + ZOL

activity confirms that OGX-011 sensitizes cells to ZOL
inhibition with increased apoptotic rates (Fig. 4D).

5A and B). In a second experiment, all animals treated
with ZOL + OGX-011 (n=8) had significant delays in
tumor growth compared with other groups starting at day
15 (respectively 196 mm3 for ZOL + OGX-011 versus
451.3 mm3 for control and 404.9 mm3 for ZOL + ScrB
ASO) and after 36 days (respectively 997.2 mm3 for ZOL
+ OGX-011 versus 2023.6 mm3 for control and 1954.2
mm3 for ZOL + ScrB ASO; ***, p<0.001; Fig. 5A). Until
day 27, ZOL + ScrB shows marginal but not significant
decrease of tumor growth compared with control group
(respectively 1368.5 mm3 and 1649.9 mm3 at day 27).
Moreover, at individual level, 0 out of 8 mice developed
tumor with volume over 1000mm3 at day 30, while all
mice in control and ZOL + ScrB ASO groups exhibited
tumor volume over 1000mm3 (Fig. 5B). Overall survival

tumor growth and decreased Ki67 expression compared
with other groups exhibiting both high tumor volume and
elevated Ki67 expression. Additionally, tumors treated
with ZOL + OGX-011 combination had significant higher
apoptosis rates compared with other groups as shown by
increased cleaved-Caspase-3 staining (Fig. 5D). These
data suggest that decreases in tumor progression in ZOL

on the tumor-bearing bone (Fig. 6A and B). An extensive
analysis of multiple bone parameters revealed a strong
and significant increase of tumor-associated bone quality

OGX-011 groups, the trabecular number (Tb.N) from 0.56
to 2.64 and 2.6mm, the trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) from
0.07 to 0.093 and 0.085mm and decreased the trabecular
separation (Tb.Sp) from 0.59 to 0.3 and 0.31mm (Fig. 6B).
Histological analysis of the tumor-bearing bone with
TRAP staining revealed a significant decreased of surface
occupied by osteoclasts compared with control group in
presence of ZOL (ZOL + SCRB and ZOL + OGX-011
groups; Fig. 6C). However, no significant difference
was observed between ZOL + SCRB and ZOL + OGX011 groups. OGX-011 does not improve ZOL-induced
bone prevention of tumor-bearing tibia compared to ZOL
alone; suggesting that the significant decrease of tumor
growth is due to a direct inhibition of tumor cells and not
via inhibition of bone prevention. Consequently, OGX011 seems to potentiate the direct effect of ZOL to inhibit
tumor cells in HOS-MNNG xenograft model.

protects, while CLU silencing enhances, ZOL-induced
cytotoxicity in OS cells. Consistent with our in vitro
results, synergistic effects were also observed in vivo
in HOS-MNNG xenograft models when OGX-011 was
combined with ZOL. OGX-011 and ZOL combination
significantly delays OS tumor growth and prolonged
survival in HOS-MNNG xenograft model.
ZOL is known to prevent bone lesions and
indirectly inhibit tumor growth by blocking the vicious
cycle between bone resorption and tumor cells within the
tumor-bone microenvironment [36]. Indeed, by blocking
osteoclasts, ZOL inhibits the release of growth factor
(TGF-β, IGF-1…) trapped in bone matrix and liberated
during bone resorption to activate proliferation of tumor
cells. In our experiment, OGX-011 does not improve
ZOL-induced bone prevention of tibia bearing-tumor in
HOS-MNNG xenograft model compared to ZOL alone;
suggesting that the significant decrease of tumor growth
after combined treatment is due to a direct inhibition of
tumor cells and not via inhibition of bone prevention.
Consequently, OGX-011 strongly potentiates the direct
effect of ZOL to inhibit tumor cells in OS xenograft
model. Indeed, decreased Ki67 expression and increased
apoptotic rates with combined ZOL and CLU inhibition
suggests that delayed tumor progression resulted from both
inhibition of tumor proliferation and enhanced treatmentinduced apoptosis. These in vivo data are consistent
with the in vitro data, and are the proof of principle to
combine OGX-011 with ZOL as new therapeutic strategy
in treatment of OS.
Molecular mechanisms of acquired drug resistance
often involve expression of one or more energydependent transporters that detect and eject anticancer
drugs from cells [17]. Studies on mechanisms of cancer
drug resistance have yielded important information about
how to circumvent this resistance to improve cancer
treatment. So far, few studies have reported molecular
mechanisms underlying N-BPs-induced resistance. Kars
et al. reported that increased ABC transporters expression
(BCRP and LRP), as well as up-regulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 gene were found in ZOL-resistant breast
cancer cells as compared to sensitive cells [40]. In the
current study, we show for the first time an increase of
another ABC transporter, MDR1 in ZOL-resistant MG63
and HOS-MNNG cells compared with sensitive cells.
MDR1 promoter has been shown to contain heat shock
elements (HSE) sequence [33], and to be transcriptionally
regulated by HSF1 [41]. Consequently, inhibition of heat
shock factor response using quercetin decreased MDR1
expression [41]. We found that ZOL induced HSF1
activity thus increasing MDR1 expression, while HSF1
knockdown using siRNA reduced MDR1 expression.
While CLU is known to be transcriptionally activated
by HSF1 [29, 31], in this study we also show that CLU
exerts a feed forward loop that in turn activates HSF1,
and also maintain MDR1 expression. Indeed, transient

DISCUSSION
Cancer cells express high levels of molecular
chaperones and pirate the protective functions of
HSF1 to support their transformation [37]. Molecular
chaperones help cells cope with stress-induced protein
aggregation, and play prominent roles in cell signaling and
transcriptional regulatory networks. A growing enthusiasm
for therapeutic modulation of this proteostasis network
highlights Hsp’s and CLU as rational targets because of
their multifunctional roles in signaling and transcriptional
networks associated with cancer progression and treatment
resistance. In this study, we set out to evaluate the role
of CLU in this heat shock response in OS since CLU is
dramatically induced by ZOL treatment and CLU inhibitor
is currently in phase III clinical Trial in prostate cancer. We
report that ZOL induces a stress response with activation
of the transcription factor HSF1 and subsequent increased
levels of CLU. This heat shock response likely enhances
emergence of treatment resistance, as Hsp27 inhibition
using siRNA which attenuates ZOL-mediated Hsp27
expression and potentiates the effect of ZOL in vitro [20].
CLU expression is rapidly up-regulated in various
cancer tissues, including osteosarcoma [23]. Previous
studies have also linked CLU expression with induction
and progression of many cancers [29]. Consistent with
these accumulated findings [38], inhibition of CLU using
OGX-011 synergistically enhances conventional as well as
molecular targeted therapies in cancer preclinical models
[31, 39]. Here, we show that ZOL increases CLU levels
by enhancing HSF1 transcriptional activity both in vitro
and in vivo, while OGX-011 inhibits ZOL induced CLU
expression. We also found that CLU silencing abrogates,
while CLU overexpression enhances, ZOL-induced HSF1
transcriptional activity, suggesting a role for CLU in the
regulation of HSF1 and the heat shock response itself, as
reported in the literature [31]. This effect of CLU on HSF1
activity is biologically relevant since CLU overexpression

overexpression of CLU significantly increased MDR1
expression. On the other hand, CLU knockdown using
OGX-011 decreases HSF1 transcriptional activity, which
subsequently leads to decreased MDR1 expression, similar
to that observed after HSF1 knockdown. Collectively,
these results highlight a biologically relevant feed-forward
regulation loop of CLU on HSF1 activity and, indirectly
on MDR1 regulation (Supp. Fig. 6).
Ory et al. described one other molecular mechanism
of ZOL resistance in OS cells by indicating that prolonged
treatment with ZOL increased FDPs expression [32], a
critical enzyme involved in the mevalonate pathway that
is inhibited by N-BPs, while Milone et al. contested this
hypothesis [42]. In our study, we confirmed that ZOLresistant cells exhibited higher FDPs expression than the
sensitive cells and, this result was correlated with increase
CLU expression. However, we demonstrated that CLU
does not affect FDPs expression at transcriptional level,
but decreases FDPs expression at protein level suggesting
that the molecular chaperone CLU could regulate
FDPs pathway at protein level, and this need further
investigations.
Moreover, several studies have reported a potential
role of p38-MAPK pathway and/or its downstream
target Hsp27 in the resistance of N-BPs treatment in
preclinical models of breast cancer and osteosarcoma
[10, 20, 43]. In our study we found that ZOL treatment
induced HSF1 activity thus enhancing at least, Hsp27
expression according with the literature. However, we
also demonstrated that CLU, also induced by HSF1,
regulates via the feed-forward loop, HSF1 activity and
thus, indirectly regulates Hsp27 expression that could lead
to other molecular mechanisms inducing resistance.
The variety of described molecular mechanisms
underlying N-BPs-induced resistance could be attributed
to the heterogeneity of tumor cells or the methods used
for inducing resistance. We described some molecular
mechanisms of resistance regulated by CLU, but it is not
excluded that other more complex mechanisms take part in
the emergence of ZOL resistance. Thus, the main problem
is to determine which molecular mechanism is involved
for each patient, in order to adapt the best therapy in the
era of personalized medicine.
In addition to synergistically enhancing anti-tumor
activity, combination therapy of OGX-011 + ZOL may
also allow dose reduction strategies to reduce toxicity and
undesirable side effects such as osteonecrosis of jaw that
has been associated with ZOL in clinical trials and clinical
use. In the present study, 50μg/kg ZOL monotherapy,
corresponding to the dose used in young patients with OS
in accord with the literature [44], showed marginal, nonsignificant decreases in tumor volume but a significant
effect on bone prevention; however, significant delays
in tumor progression were seen at this dose when ZOL
was combined with OGX-011, with no toxicity observed.
Moreover, OGX-011 is a second-generation ASO with a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

long tissue half-life of ~7 days that suppresses CLU levels
in vitro and in vivo. OGX-011 improved the efficacy
of many varied anti-cancer therapies by suppressing
treatment-induced CLU and the stress response [31] and
increased pre-clinical activity in many xenograft models
of cancer [29, 39, 45].
In summary, this paper helps define how stress
induced by ZOL regulates CLU by induction of HSF1
activity and, in turn, how CLU regulates HSF1 activity,
cell survival, and treatment resistance. We demonstrate,
for the first time, that CLU inhibition abrogates the
heat shock response and synergistically potentiates the
cytotoxic activity of ZOL directly on tumor cells, thus,
preventing emergence of resistance. These observations
are clinically relevant since CLU inhibitors are in phase III
clinical trials in prostate cancer, and provide a framework
for building new drug combinations built on mechanismbased interventions to overcome drug resistance. The
present study supports for the first time the development
of targeted strategies employing OGX-011 in combination
with ZOL to improve patient outcome in osteosarcoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Tumor cell lines
The human osteosarcoma cell lines MG63 (young
male osteosarcoma), SaOS2 (young female osteosarcoma),
U2OS (young female osteosarcoma from tibia origin) and
MNNG/HOS (young female high grade osteosarcoma
from femur origin transformed in vitro by N-methyl N’nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine treatment), were purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in
DMEM (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented
with 5% fetal bovine serum and 2mmol/L L-glutamine.
All cell lines were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2/air
atmosphere at 37oC. All cell lines were passaged for less
than 3 months after resurrection.

Therapeutic agents
ZOL, 1-hydroxy-2-(1H-imidazole-1-yl) ethylidenebisphosphonic acid supplied as the disodium salt by
Novartis Pharma AG, was dissolved in PBS at 10mM
stock solution and stored at -20°C.
Second-generation
antisense
(OGX-011)
and scrambled (ScrB) oligonucleotides with a
2′-O-(2-methoxy) ethyl modification were supplied
by
OncoGenexPharmaceuticals
(Vancouver,
British Columbia, Canada). OGX-011 sequence
5′-CAGCAGCAGAGTCTTCATCAT-3′ corresponds to the
initiation site in exon II of human CLU. The ScrB control
sequence was 5′-CAGCGCTGACAACAGTTTCAT-3′.

were purchased from SantaCruz Biotechnology (Dallas,
USA). Osteosarcoma cells were treated with siRNA or
oligonucleotides using protocols described previously
[39].

incubation, the filters were washed 3 times with washing
buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween) for 5min. Filters
were then probed with the secondary antibody coupled to
horseradish peroxidase. Antibody binding was visualized
with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Roche
Molecular Biomedicals).

Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays

Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR

Osteosarcoma cancer cell lines were plated in
DMEM with 5% FBS and treated with zoledronic acid
at indicated concentration and time point, cell growth
being measured using the crystal violet assay as described
previously [46]. Detection and quantitation of apoptotic
cells were done by Caspase-3 assay (described below).
Each assay was repeated in triplicate.
The combination index (CI) was evaluated
using CalcuSyn dose effect analysis software (Biosoft,
Cambridge, UK). This method, based on the multiple
drug effect equation of Chou-Talalay [35], is suitable for
calculating combined drug activity over a wide range of
growth inhibition: CI =1, additivity; CI >1, antagonism;
CI <1, synergism. CI was calculated at ED50 and ED75.
Caspase-3/7 activity was assessed 3 days after
treatment using the kit CaspACE Assay System,
Fluorometric (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Fifty µg of
total cell lysate were incubated with caspase-3 substrate
AC-DEVD-AMC at room temperature for 4h and
caspase-3 activity was quantified in a fluorometer with
360nm excitation and 460nm emission.

Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells (after
48h of treatment) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Inc.). Two μg of total RNA was reversed
transcribed using the Transcriptor First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Roche Applied Science). Real-time
monitoring of PCR amplification of complementary DNA
(cDNA) was performed using DNA primers (supplemental
table S1) on ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection
System (applied Biosystems) with SYBR PCR Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems). Target gene expression was
normalized to GAPDH levels in respective samples as an
internal standard, and the comparative cycle threshold (Ct)
method was used to calculated relative quantification of
target mRNAs. Each assay was performed in triplicate.

Luciferase assay
Osteosarcoma cells (2.5x105) were plated on sixplates and transfected using lipofectin (6µL per well;
Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.). The Heat Shock
Element (HSE) reporter is designed to monitor the
activity of heat shock response through measuring the
transcriptional activity of HSF1. The total amount HSE
plasmids DNA used were normalized to 1µg per well
by the addition of a control plasmid. Ten µM zoledronic
acid was added 8h after the transfection and for 48h.
HSE-luciferase activity was measured using DualLuciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) with the aid
of a microplate luminometer (TriStar LB-941 Berthold
Technologies). All experiments were carried out in
triplicate wells and repeated 3 times.

Cell cycle analysis
Osteosarcoma cell lines were treated twice with
300nM ScrB or OGX-011, followed by 1μM ZOL for
48h, trypsinized, washed twice and incubated in PBS
containing 0.12% Triton X-100, 0.12mM EDTA and
100μg/ml ribonuclease A; 50μg/ml propidium iodide was
then added to each sample for 20min at 4°C. Cell cycle
distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman
Coulter Cytomics FC-500, Beckman, Inc., Miamai, FL),
based on 2N and 4N DNA content. Each assay was done
in triplicate.

Animal Treatment

Western blotting analysis

Five-week-old female Rj:NMRI-nude mice were
anesthetized by inhalation of an isoflurane/air mixture
(2%, 1L/min) before an i.m. inoculation of 2 × 106
human MNNG/HOS osteosarcoma cells close to the tibia.
Tumors appeared in contact with the tibia approximately
8 days later and led to osteolytic lesions associated with
development of pulmonary metastasis mimicking the
human pathology. Once tumors were palpable, mice were
randomly assigned (n=8) to vehicle, ZOL + ScrB ASO or
ZOL + OGX-011 groups. ZOL (50μg/kg; formulation in
PBS) was injected s.c. three times per week and OGX-011

Samples containing equal amounts of protein
(depending on the antibody, 5-50µg) from lysates of
cultured tumor OS cell lines underwent electrophoresis
on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and were transferred to
nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked in PBS
containing 3% BSA and 0.1% Tween at room temperature
for 1h and blots were probed overnight at 4°C with primary
antibodies (anti-clusterin, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Dallas, TX, USA; anti-vinculin, Sigma-Aldrich Corp,
St. Louis, MO, USA) to detect proteins of interest. After

or ScrB ASO (15mg/kg) was injected intra-peritoneally
once daily for the first week and then three times per week.
Each experimental group consisted of 8 mice. Tumor
volume was measured three times weekly (length x width
x depth x 0.5432). Data points were expressed as average
tumor volume ± SEM.
When tumor volume reached ≥10% of body
weight, mice were sacrificed and tumors harvested for
immunohistochemistry. Animal care and experimental
protocols were approved by the French Ministry
of Research and were done in accordance with the
institutional guidelines of the French Ethical Committee
protocol agreement number 1280.01 and under the
supervision of authorized investigators.
