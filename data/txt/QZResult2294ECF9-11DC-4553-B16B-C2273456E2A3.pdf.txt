ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy characterized by monoclonal
paraproteinemia and tissue plasmocytosis. In advanced MM cytopenia and osteopathy
may occur. Although several effective treatment strategies have been developed
in recent years, there is still a need to identify new drug targets and to develop
more effective therapies for patients with advanced MM. We examined the effects
of 15 targeted drugs on growth and survival of primary MM cells and 5 MM cell lines
(MM.1S, NCI-H929, OPM-2, RPMI-8226, U-266). The PI3-kinase blocker BEZ235, the
pan-BCL-2 inhibitor obatoclax, the Hsp90-targeting drug 17AAG, and the Polo-like
kinase-1 inhibitor BI2536, were found to exert major growth-inhibitory effects in all
5 MM cell lines tested. Moreover, these drugs suppressed the in vitro proliferation
of primary bone marrow-derived MM cells and induced apoptosis at pharmacologic
drug concentrations. Apoptosis-inducing effects were not only seen in the bulk of
MM cells but also in MM stem cell-containing CD138−/CD20+/CD27+ memory B-cell
fractions. Synergistic growth-inhibitory effects were observed in MM cell lines using
various drug combinations, including 17AAG+BI2536 in MM.1S, OPM-2, RPMI-8226,
and U-266 cells, 17AAG+BEZ235 in MM.1S, OPM-2, RPMI-8226, and U-266 cells,
17AAG+obatoclax in MM.1S, NCI-H929, OPM-2, and RPMI-8226 cells, BI2536+BEZ235
in MM.1S, NCI-H929, OPM-2, and RPMI-8226 cells, BI2536+obatoclax in MM.1S,
OPM-2 and RPMI-8226 cells, and BEZ235+obatoclax in MM.1S and RPMI-8226 cells.
Together, our data show that various targeted drugs induce profound and often
synergistic anti-neoplastic effects in MM cells which may have clinical implications
and may contribute to the development of novel treatment strategies in advanced MM.

growth-rate and biologic behaviour, MM cells proliferate
and expand in the BM and other organs and subsequently
cause organ damage [1–5]. As a result, patients with
advanced MM are suffering from pancytopenia,
osteolyses, and/or kidney damage. In addition, MM
patients often suffer from diffuse osteoporosis and
secondary immunoglobulin deficiency [1–4, 10, 11].
During the past 2 decades, several different molecular
and cytogenetic risk factors predicting the clinical course
and progression in MM have been identified [12–19]. In

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematopoietic
neoplasm characterized by an expansion of clonal plasma
cells (PC) in the bone marrow (BM) and by an excessive
production of monoclonal immunoglobulins (Ig), usually
of the IgG- or IgA type [1–3]. Growth, survival, and
differentiation of MM cells are triggered by various prooncogenic signalling pathways as well as by cytokines
and the BM microenvironment [4–9]. Depending on their

a considerable number of patients, MM develops from
a premalignant condition referred to as monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) [20].
Treatment of progressive MM is usually based on
cytoreductive agents, glucocorticosteroids, and novel
targeted drugs. In the last few years, several attempts have
been made to improve treatment of MM by combining
novel targeted drugs with each other or with conventional
chemotherapy [21–25]. However, despite impressive
results, a relatively high percentage of patients develop
drug resistances over time. For high risk patients and
relapsed MM, more intensive treatments are available,
including poly-chemotherapy and autologous or allogeneic
stem cell transplantation [21, 26–28]. However, in most
cases, MM is still an incurable malignancy. Therefore,
there is still a need to identify novel drug-targets and more
effective targeted drugs and drug combinations for patients
with advanced MM.
Recently, a number of signalling pathways and
molecules critically involved in the regulation of growth
and survival of MM cells have been identified. These
include, among others, the Notch-signalling pathway, the
Hedgehog pathway, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),
the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, and
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [29–36]. Furthermore,
the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor 17AAG and
the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor vorinostat were
found to exert substantial anti-neoplastic effects on MM
cells [37–39]. Other potential drug targets in MM cells
are members of the B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-2 family and
Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) [40–42].
The concept of neoplastic stem cells has been
introduced some time ago, with the intention to explain
cellular hierarchies in malignant clones and to define
critical target cell populations that exhibit long-term
disease-propagating capacity [43–46]. In many neoplasms,
these cells are extremely immature and represent a
minority in the clone. Based on their selective potential to
propagate the malignancy for unlimited time periods, these
cells represent a most critical target cell population that
needs to be attacked and eliminated in curative treatment
approaches [47–49]. In myeloid neoplasms, such as acute
myeloid leukemia (AML), the disease-initiating stem- and
progenitor cells are considered to reside within a CD34+
compartment of the clone [43–46]. By contrast, in MM,
the phenotype of neoplastic stem cells (MM stem cells =
MMSC) is a matter of debate [52–60]. In several studies,
the mouse-repopulating MMSC were found to reside
within a CD138−/CD20+/CD27+ (or a CD19+/CD27+/
CD138−) cell population [52–56]. In other studies, MMSC
were found to reside within a CD19−/CD45low/CD38+/
CD138+ fraction of the clone [56, 57]. In each case, only
a small sub-fraction of these cell populations may fulfil
true stem cell function. The aims of this study were to
examine the effects of various targeted drugs on growth
and survival of MM cells, to ask whether novel targeted
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

drugs exert synergistic growth-inhibitory effect, and to
explore whether MMSC also respond to these drugs.

RESULTS
Various targeted drugs inhibit proliferation of
MM cell lines
As assessed by 3H-thymidine uptake, a number of
antineoplastic drugs were found to inhibit growth of MM
cells at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (Table
1). Four drugs blocked proliferation in all five MM cell
lines tested: the PLK-1 inhibitor BI2536 (IC50 0.01-0.05
μM), the pan-BCL-2 antagonist obatoclax (IC50 0.1-0.5
μM), the HSP90 inhibitor 17AAG (IC50 0.01-1 μM),
and the PI3 kinase/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 (IC50 0.011 μM) (Table 1). The Aurora-kinase-targeting drug VX680 inhibited growth of MM.1S, NCI-H929, and OPM2 cells (IC50 0.1-1 μM). The HDAC-inhibitor vorinostat
suppressed the proliferation of MM.1S, NCI-H929, and
U-266 cells (IC50 0.1-1 μM). In the other MM cell lines,
vorinostat showed no effects on proliferation below 1
μM. Sunitinib blocked proliferation of MM.1S cells and
U-266 cells (IC50 0.1 -1 μM) but did not inhibit growth
in the other MM cell lines (Table 1). Similarly, nilotinib
suppressed growth of MM.1S and U-266 cells (IC50 0.5-1
μM) but not inhibit growth in the other MM cell lines (IC50
>1 μM). A summary of the drug effects on growth of MM
cell lines is shown in Table 1.

Effects of targeted drugs on in vitro proliferation
of primary MM cells
In a next step, we examined the effects of 17AAG,
BI2536, BEZ235, and obatoclax on in vitro proliferation
of primary neoplastic PC obtained from the BM of patients
with MM. The patients’ characteristics are shown in Table
2. We found that all 4 drugs tested exert dose-dependent
growth-inhibitory effects in primary MM cells, with
pharmacologically relevant IC50 values (Table 3). Figure
1 shows a summary of growth-inhibitory effects obtained
with the 4 drugs in the primary cell samples tested. IC50
values obtained with primary BM cells (PC) were found
to be within a pharmacological range and to correspond to
IC50 values obtained with the MM cell lines tested (Figure
1, Tables 1 and 3).

Various targeted drugs induce apoptosis in MM
cell lines
To define the mechanism of drug action, we
examined drug effects on survival and apoptosis in MM
cells. Apoptosis was quantified by analyzing expression
of active caspase-3 by flow cytometry (Table 4). BI2536,
obatoclax, BEZ235, and 17AAG produced dose-dependent

drugs were BI2536 (EC50 0.001-0.01 μM) and obatoclax
(EC50 0.001-0.5 μM), followed by BEZ235 (EC50 0.01-0.5
μM) and 17AAG (EC50 0.01-1 μM). The HDAC blocker
VX-680 induced growth inhibition in OPM-2, RPMI8226, and U-266 cells (EC50 0.1-1 μM), whereas the other
cell lines tested did not respond to VX-680 (Table 4).
Vorinostat induced apoptosis in U-266 cells (EC50 0.5-1
μM) but did not produce apoptosis in the other MM cell
lines. Sunitinib was found to exert apoptosis-inducing
effects in MM.1S, OPM-2, RPMI-8226, and U-266 cells
(EC50 0.5-1 μM) (Table 4). The effects of the most potent
drugs (17AAG, BI2536, BEZ235) on survival of MM cells
was confirmed by Annexin V/PI staining, with similar
EC50 values compared to that obtained by staining for
active caspase-3 (Figure 2).

tested (17AAG, BI2536, BEZ235) induced apoptosis in
CD138+ MM cells as well as in CD138−/CD20+/CD27+
MMSC-containing cell fractions in all donors tested
(Figure 3). However, we also found that all three drugs
produce apoptosis in presumably normal CD34+/CD38−
HSC and CD34+/CD38+ progenitor cells (Figure 3).

We next examined the effects of 17AAG, BI2536,

lines tested. As expected, the PI3 kinase/mTOR blocker
BEZ235 produced a G1 cell cycle arrest in all MM cell
lines tested, whereas 17AAG and BI2536 induced a G2
cell cycle arrest in these cells (Figure 4). The effects of
17AAG and BI2536 on cell cycle progression were weaker
compared to the effects produced by BEZ235 (Figure 4).

Identification of drug combinations producing
synergistic growth-inhibitory effects

A summary of drug-combination effects is shown in
Table 5. Clear synergistic growth-inhibitory effects
were observed when applying the drug combinations
17AAG+BI2536 and 17AAG+BEZ235 in MM.1S, OPM2, RPMI-8226, and U-266 cells, 17AAG+obatoclax and
BI2536+BEZ235 in MM.1S, NCI-H929, OPM-2, and
RPMI-8226 cells, BI2536+obatoclax in MM.1S, OPM2, and RPMI-8226 cells, and BEZ235+obatoclax in
MM.1S and RPMI-8226 cells (Table 5). Figure 5 shows

Based on the encouraging results obtained with
several of the targeted drugs applied and because of
their potential toxicity, we screened for cooperative
anti-neoplastic drug effects in the 5 MM cell lines
employed. Drug combinations were classified as additive,
antagonistic, or synergistic by CalcuSyn software.

examples of synergistic drug interactions obtained in drug
combination experiments in MM cell lines.

Overall, there is a need to develop new more effective
targeted drugs and drug combinations for these patients.
In the past few years, several novel targeted drugs have
shown promising results in preclinical studies [21–25, 29,
31–33, 36–42]. In the current study, we have extended
these analyses by examining the effects of various targeted
drugs on growth and survival of primary MM cells and
putative MMSC, and by combining most effective targeted
drugs with each other. Of the 15 drugs tested in this study,
17AAG, BI2536, BEZ235, and obatoclax were identified
as potent inhibitors of growth and survival of MM cells.
In addition, we found that all 4 drugs block growth and
survival of primary MM cells, and that drug combinations
elicit additive or even synergistic growth-inhibitory
effects. These data may have clinical implications and may
pave the way for the development of novel more effective
anti-MM therapies.
A number of different signaling pathways and
survival molecules contribute to growth and survival of
MM cells [29–36]. During the past 15 years, targeted drugs
have been developed that interfere with these pathways
and block specific signaling molecules or survival-related

Identification of molecular targets expressed in
MM cell lines
As assessed by qPCR, all MM cell lines expressed
transcripts specific for PLK-1, PI3K, mTOR, BCL-2, and
the myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1) antigen (Table 6).
BCL-xL mRNA was detected in MM.1S, RPMI-8226,
and U-266 cells, but not in NCI-H929 and OPM-2 cells.
No definitive correlation between expression of molecular
targets (or target-patterns) and responses to individual
drugs or drug combinations was found.

DISCUSSION
During the past few years, therapy of MM improved
considerably and resulted in better progression-free and
overall survival. However, still, not all patients with MM
enter long-term progression-free survival after therapy.

Figure 3: Effects of 17AAG, BI2536, and BEZ235 on survival of primary MM cells. Primary BM cells derived from 6 patients
with MM were incubated in control medium (Co) or in medium containing 17AAG, BI2536, or BEZ235 (each 1 μM) at 37°C for 48 hours.
Thereafter, cells were stained with antibodies against AnnexinV A. or active caspase-3 B. by multicolor flow cytometry as described in the
text. The following subsets of cells were examined: CD138+ MM cells (black bars), CD138−/CD27+/CD20+ putative MMSC (grey bars),
CD34+/CD38− hematopoietic stem cells (open bars), and CD34+/CD38+ cells (hatched bars). Results are expressed as percent AnnexinV+
cells (A) or percent active caspase-3+ cells (B) and represent the mean±S.D. from 6 independent experiments. Asterisk (*): p<0.05.

To determine potential additive or synergistic drug effects, MM cell lines were exposed to 17AAG, BI2536, BEZ235, and
obatoclax, alone or in combination at a fixed ratio of drug concentrations at 37°C for 48 hours. Proliferation was measured
by analyzing 3H-thymidine uptake. Drug interactions (synergistic = s, additive = ad, and antagonistic = an) were calculated
by CalcuSyn software. A combination index (CI) of <1 indicates synergism, CI values of 1 indicate additive effects, and CI
values >1 indicate antagonistic drug effects.
molecules in neoplastic cells [32, 33, 37–42]. In our study,
15 targeted drugs were applied, and 4 of these drugs were
found to act as potent inhibitors of growth and survival
of MM cells. These drugs are the Hsp90 targeting drug
17AAG, the PLK-1 inhibitor BI2536, the dual PI3 kinase/
mTOR blocker BEZ235, and the pan BCL-2 inhibitor
obatoclax. The IC50 values produced by these drugs were
found to be in a pharmacologically relevant range. In
addition, these drugs suppressed cell cycle progression and
induced apoptosis in MM cells. We were also able to show
that the molecular targets through which these drugs exert
their growth-inhibitory effects, namely PLK-1, PI3K,
mTOR, BCL-2, BCL-xL, and MCL-1, are expressed
in MM cells. Whereas most targets were expressed
abundantly in MM cell lines, BCL-xL mRNA was only
expressed at low levels or was not detected in the MM
cell lines tested. We also tried to correlate (synergistic)
drug effects with target expression patterns in MM cells.
However, no clear correlation between expression of
molecular targets and responses to individual drugs or
drug combinations was found. This is best explained
by the fact that several different (known and unknown)
targets are recognized by these drugs and contribute to the
observed drug effects.
Cell line models are a useful tool for screening
potential drug effects in various cancer entities. However,
primary cells may behave differentially and often show
different responses to targeted drugs. Therefore, we
examined drug effects on primary MM cells. We found
that 17AAG, BI2536, BEZ235, and obatoclax induce
growth inhibition in primary BM-derived MM cells in all
patients tested. The IC50 values were comparable among
patients, independent of the percentage of neoplastic cells
in BM samples, type of MM, or disease status (diagnostic
sample versus relapse). Although all 4 drugs exerted potent

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effects, slightly lower IC50 values were obtained with
BI2536 and BEZ235 compared to 17AAG and obatoclax.
It is also noteworthy that the IC50 values obtained with
primary MM cells corresponded to IC50 values obtained
in MM cell lines.
In the past 15 years, neoplastic stem cells have been
identified as a novel relevant target of therapy in malignant
blood cell disorders [47–49]. Any type of therapy can only
be curative when eliminating these disease-propagating
cells. In MM, the phenotype of neoplastic stem cells
(MMSC) is still a matter of debate [45, 52–60]. In the
past few years evidence has accumulated to suggest that
these cells may reside as rare subset in a CD138−/CD20+/
CD27+ population of the clone [52–56]. In the present
study, we examined the effects of the 4 most potent drugs
on survival of these putative MMSC. We found that these
drugs induce apoptosis not only in the bulk of MM cells
but also in putative MMSC, which may have clinical
implications. However, these studies were performed in
vitro, and additional studies using these drugs in suitable
xenotransplantation assays performed with primary
MM cells would be required to confirm their MMSCeliminating activity. Unfortunately, however, no robust
xenotransplantation model is available in MM. Once
such model is available, we will examine drug effects on
MMSC engraftment in future studies.
Most of the targeted drugs examined may also exert
growth-inhibitory effects on normal blood and BM cells.
In the current study, we examined the effects of the 4 most
potent targeted drugs on survival of CD34+/CD38− HSC
and CD34+/CD38+ progenitor cells. In these experiments
all 4 drugs induced apoptosis in normal BM stem and
progenitor cells at 1 μM. These data suggest that most
of these drugs can produce cytopenia in patients which
corresponds with clinical observations. An alternative

possibility may be that some of the CD34+ cells were
immature clonal cells. However, although this hypothesis
has been propagated by some investigators [61, 62] others
have concluded that clonal MM progenitors do not reside
within CD34+ cells [63].
Based on the obvious risk of side effects and the
observation that synergistic drug effects can often be
obtained, anti-MM therapy usually consists of various
drug combinations. In the present study, we were
interested to learn whether the most effective targeted
drugs identified would also show cooperative or even

synergistic anti-proliferative effects on MM cells when
applied in combination. Indeed, we found that various
combinations of the targeted drugs applied produce clear
synergistic effects on growth of MM cell lines. The most
potent synergistic effects were seen when combining
BI2536 and BEZ235 in MM.1S or BI2536 and obatoclax
in OPM-2 and 17AAG and BEZ235 in RPMI-8226 cells.
Remarkably, in MM.1S cells and RPMI-8226 cells, all
drug combinations applied showed synergistic effects.
These data suggest that it may be reasonable to apply
such drug combinations also in vivo once the individual

To quantify mRNA expression levels in myeloma cell lines, qPCR was performed using primers specific for PLK-1, PI3K,
mTOR, BCL-2, BCL-xL, MCL-1, and ABL (Table 7). mRNA levels were expressed as percentage of ABL. The following

drugs have shown to act anti-neoplastic in patients. By
employing such combination strategies, drug-induced
toxicity may also be reduced.
In conclusion, our data show that various targeted
drugs exert major growth-inhibitory and apoptosisinducing effects on primary MM cells, their putative
stem cells, and MM cell lines, and that these effects can
be further augmented by applying drug combinations.
Clinical trials are now warranted in order to confirm these
effects in vivo in patients with MM. The most obvious
clinical need may be patients with relapsed or refractory
MM [64, 65].

2D1, APC-labeled CD38 mAb HIT2, PE-labeled and
Alexa Fluor® 647-labeled active caspase-3 mAb C92605 were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA,

(San Diego, CA, USA), and an Annexin V/FITC kit from
eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA).

Culture of MM cells
The MM cell lines NCI-H929, OPM-2, RPMI8226 and U-266 were obtained from the German
Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DMSZ;
Braunschweig, Germany) and MM.1S from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA).
Cell lines were cultured in RPMI1640 with 10% FCS
and antibiotics at 5% CO2 and 37°C. Cells were passaged
every 2-3 days and re-thawed from an original stock every
6-8 weeks. The biologic stability of these cell lines was
checked by cell surface phenotyping (flow cytometry).
Primary BM cells were obtained (routine investigations)
from 8 patients with MM after written informed consent
was given. Samples were collected at diagnosis, or relapse
(Table 2). The study was approved by the ethics committee
of the Medical University of Vienna. Primary BM cells
were either analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry or were
fractionated using Ficoll, in order to obtain mononuclear
cells (MNC).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
A number of anti-neoplastic drugs were tested for
their ability to inhibit growth of MM cells: the tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI) bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib,
sorafenib, sunitinib, and nilotinib, the ErbB-receptor
inhibitors lapatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib, the Aurorakinase inhibitor VX-680, the HSP90 inhibitor 17AAG,
the PLK-1 inhibitor BI2536, the pan-BCL-2 antagonist
obatoclax, and the HDAC-inhibitor vorinostat were
purchased from Chemietek (Indianapolis, IN, USA). The
PI3 kinase/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 was obtained from
Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA). Stock solutions
of drugs were prepared by dissolving in dimethylsulfoxide,
DMSO (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). RPMI 1640
medium and fetal calf serum (FCS) were purchased from
PAA Laboratories (Pasching, Austria), and 3H-thymidine
from PerkinElmer (Waltham, MA, USA). FITC-labeled

defined as CD138+ cells and the MMSC-containing cell
fractions were defined as CD138−/CD20+/CD27+ cells
using FITC-labeled CD138 mAb, APC-labeled CD27
mAb, and PerCP-labeled CD20 mAb. Hematopoietic
stem cells (HSC) were defined as CD34+/CD38- cells and
hematopoietic progenitors as CD34+/CD38+ cells, using
FITC-labeled CD34 mAb and APC-labeled CD38 mAb.
After erythrocyte-lysis using FACS-Lysing-Solution
(BD Biosciences) PC, MMSC, HSC, and hematopoietic
progenitor cells were analyzed by multicolor flow
cytometry on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) using
FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR, USA). To
study drug effects on survival (apoptosis) of primary PC,
MMSC, HSC, and progenitors cells, primary BM MNC
of 6 MM patients were incubated in control medium,
17AAG, BI2536, or BEZ235 (1 μM each) at 37°C for
48 hours. Thereafter, cells were washed and examined
for apoptosis by combined staining for surface antigens
(to define cell populations) and either AnnexinV-FITC
plus 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) or with an antibody against active
caspase-3 as described [66]. Apoptosis was quantified
by measuring the percentage of AnnexinV+ cells and
active caspase-3+ cells in various gated cell fractions,
namely CD138+ PC, CD138-/CD20+/CD27+ MMSC,
CD34+/CD38- HSC, and CD34+/CD38+ hematopoietic
progenitor cells.

To assess the effects of targeted drugs on expression
of activated caspase-3, flow cytometry experiments
were performed using MM cell lines and an antibody
against active caspase-3 (C92-605; BD Biosciences).
In these experiments, cells were cultured in the
presence of control medium or targeted drugs at various
concentrations (0.001-10 μM) at 37°C for 48 hours. Prior
to staining, cells were fixed in formaldehyde (2%), and
permeabilized using methanol (100%) at -20°C for 30
minutes. Expression of active caspase-3 was analyzed
on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) as decribed [66].
To confirm apoptosis in cell lines after drug exposure,
Annexin V/PI staining was performed with the three
most effective drugs 17AAG, BI2536, BEZ235 in
all five MM cell lines as reported [67]. For cell cycle
studies with the three potent drugs 17AAG, BI2536 and
BEZ235, drug-exposed cells were resuspended in 500
μL permeabilization buffer (0.1% Na-acetate and 0.1%
Triton X-100). Then 40 μl PI were added, and cell cycle
distribution analyzed on a FACSCalibur. For obatoclax,
the AnnexinV/PI staining and cell cycle analyis was not
possible due to the autofluoresence of the drug.

Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA was isolated from the five MM cell
lines (MM1.S, NCI-H929, OPM-2, RPMI-8226, U-266)
using RNeasy MinEluteTM Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). cDNA was synthesized using Moloney
murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), random primers, First-Strand-Buffer,
dNTPs, and RNasin (all from Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR was performed as
described [66] using iTaq SYBR-Green-Supermix with
ROX (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and primers specific for
BCL-2, BCL-xL, MCL-1, PI3K, mTOR and PLK-1 (Table
7). BCL-2, BCL-xL, MCL-1, PI3K, mTOR, and PLK1 mRNA levels were expressed as percentage of ABL
transcript levels [66].

Evaluation of drug effects on proliferation of
MM cell lines and primary MM cells
To study the effects of various drugs on
proliferation of MM cell lines, 3H-thymidine
incorporation experiments were performed. For this
purpose, MM.1S, NCI-H929, OPM-2, RPMI-8226 and
U-266 cells (104/well) were seeded in 96-well plates
(TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) and incubated with
increasing drug concentrations (0.001-10 μM) at 37°C
for 48 hours. In a different set of experiment, primary
BM derived cells obtained from 6 patients with MM were
incubated in control medium or various concentrations
of 17AAG, BI2536, obatoclax, and BEZ235 (0.0011 μM) at 37°C for 48 hours. After incubation, 0.5 μCi
of 3H-thymidine was added to each well and kept for
16 hours (37°C). Cells were then harvested on filter
membranes (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA) in a
FilterMate Harvester (Perkin Elmer). Filters were airdried and the bound radioactivity counted in a ß-counter
(MicroBeta2 2450 Microplate Counter, Perkin Elmer).
To determine potential additive or synergistic drug
effects, MM cells were exposed to various combinations
of 17AAG, BI2536, BEZ235, and obatoclax at a fixed
ratio of drug concentrations [67]. All experiments were
performed in triplicates.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical evaluation of data
To determine the significance in differences in
growth and apoptosis, the Student’s t test for dependent
samples was applied. Results were considered significant
when p<0.05. Drug interactions (additive, synergistic,
and antagonistic) were determined by calculating
combination index (CI) values using CalcuSyn software
(Biosoft, Cambridge, U.K.) [68]. A CI value of 1 indicates
an additive effect, whereas CI values below 1 indicate
synergistic drug effects, and CI values >1 antagonistic
effects.
