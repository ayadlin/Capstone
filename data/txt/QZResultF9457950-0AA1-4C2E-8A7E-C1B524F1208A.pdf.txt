in-frame deletions in exon 19 and the L858R point mutation in
exon 21. These mutations induce oncogenic transformation in both
fibroblasts and lung epithelial cells in vitro and in transgenic mice
through constitutive activation of EGFR (4–6). The exons 19 and
21 mutations also confer sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKI), including gefitinib and erlotinib (4). Although
initially effective in many patients with NSCLC, resistance to
gefitinib and erlotinib invariably develops (7). One mechanism of
acquired resistance is selection for a second threonine-tomethionine substitution at position 790 (T790M; ref. 8). This
second-site mutation in EGFR, which is analogous to the T315I
‘‘gatekeeper’’ mutation that confers resistance of bcr-abl to
imatinib (9), is predicted to block binding of erlotinib and gefitinib
to the EGFR ATP-binding domain.
Hsp90 is a protein chaperone with a role in protein folding,
stability, and maturation. Hsp90 clients include a subset of kinases,
steroid receptors, and transcription factors, many of which are
dysregulated in human cancer (10–15). Certain mutated oncoproteins, including bcr-abl and V600E BRAF, are clients of Hsp90,
whereas their wild-type counterparts are either not dependent or
only weakly dependent upon Hsp90 (16–18). It is hypothesized that
these ‘‘gain of function’’ mutations are unable to fold properly in
the absence of Hsp90. These oncoproteins, therefore, gain the
ability to induce transformation at the expense of greater
dependence upon Hsp90 chaperone function.
Our understanding of Hsp90 biology is, in great degree, derived
from the study of geldanamycin and radicicol, natural products
that bind a regulatory pocket in the N-terminal domain of the
protein, which is conserved across species (19–21). The physiologic
ligands of the pocket are ATP and ADP. Binding of geldanamycin,
radicicol, or their analogues mimics the effects of ADP, resulting in
the degradation of proteins that require Hsp90 for maturation or
stability (22, 23). Geldanamycin proved too toxic for human use,
but several derivatives, including 17-allylamino-17-demethoxy
geldanamycin (17-AAG) are currently being tested in patients with
promising early results in several cancer types, including HER2
amplified breast cancers, myeloma, and acute myelogenous
leukemia (24).
Studies by several groups have shown that wild-type EGFR is
relatively insensitive to degradation by inhibitors of Hsp90
compared with HER2 (25, 26). It has been reported that, whereas
both the mature and nascent forms of HER2 are degraded by
geldanamycin, only nascent EGFR is Hsp90 dependent (26).
Recently, we and others have shown that exons 19 and 21 EGFR
kinase domain mutants are degraded by Hsp90 inhibitors (27, 28).
These data suggest that Hsp90 is permissive for the development of
mutant EGFR-dependent lung cancers and, therefore, may be an

Abstract
Mutations in the kinase domain of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) are found in a subset of patients with
lung cancer and correlate with response to EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI). Resistance to these agents invariably
develops, and current treatment strategies have limited
efficacy in this setting. Hsp90 inhibitors, such as 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), induce the degradation of EGFR and other Hsp90 interacting proteins and
may thus have utility in tumors dependent upon sensitive
Hsp90 clients. We find that the EGFR mutations found most
commonly in patients with lung adenocarcinoma who respond
to EGFR TKIs are potently degraded by 17-AAG. Although the
expression of wild-type EGFR was also down-regulated by 17AAG, its degradation required higher concentrations of drug
and a longer duration of drug exposure. In animal models, a
single dose of 17-AAG was sufficient to induce degradation of
mutant EGFR and inhibit downstream signaling. 17-AAG
treatment, at its maximal tolerated dose, caused a significant
delay in H3255 (L858R EGFR) xenograft growth but was less
effective than the EGFR TKI gefitinib. 17-AAG alone delayed,
but did not completely inhibit, the growth of H1650 and H1975
xenografts, two EGFR mutant models which show intermediate and high levels of gefitinib resistance. 17-AAG could be
safely coadministered with paclitaxel, and the combination
was significantly more effective than either drug alone. These
data suggest that Hsp90 inhibition in combination with
chemotherapy may represent an effective treatment strategy
for patients whose tumors express EGFR kinase domain
mutations, including those with de novo and acquired
resistance to EGFR TKIs. [Cancer Res 2008;68(2):589–96]

Introduction
Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are found in f10% of
non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) in the United States and in as
many as 25% of tumors from East Asian populations (1–3). The
most common EGFR mutations observed in lung cancer are small

under an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee–approved protocol,
and institutional guidelines for the proper and humane use of animals were
followed. Xenografts were generated by injecting 7 to 10  106 cells together
with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Before treatment, mice were randomized to
receive 17-AAG, gefitinib, paclitaxel, paclitaxel and 17-AAG, or the vehicles
only as control. Before injection, 17-AAG was diluted with EPL solution.
Paclitaxel was diluted in normal saline at a minimum 1:3 dilution. Both
agents were given by i.p. injection. Gefitinib was formulated in distilled
water with 0.5% lactic acid and given by oral gavages. Tumor size was
measured twice weekly by caliper in control and treatment groups. The
average tumor volume in each group was expressed in cubic millimeter and
calculated using the formula p / 6  (large diameter)  (small diameter)2.
For statistical purposes, the average tumor burden for each mouse was
characterized using the area under the volume–time profile and compared
across groups using a Wilcoxon test with the exact reference distribution.
Mice were euthanized by CO2. To prepare tumor lysates, tumor tissues was
homogenized in SDS lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 2% SDS].

effective clinical strategy in patients whose tumors express activating mutations of EGFR, including those who have developed
clinical resistance to EGFR TKIs.
We now show that 17-AAG, the Hsp90 inhibitor being tested in
phases 1 and 2 clinical trials, can induce the degradation of mutant
EGFR, but not wild-type EGFR, in xenograft tumors at nontoxic
doses. The maximal effect of 17-AAG on mutant EGFR expression
was observed 6 h posttreatment, with recovery to baseline by 48 h.
17-AAG was effective in delaying xenograft tumor growth, but was
significantly less effective than gefitinib in a gefitinib-sensitive,
EGFR mutant–driven model. This may have been in part due to the
inability, because of toxicity limitations, to continuously inhibit
EGFR signaling with 17-AAG. Although only modest antitumor
activity was observed in EGFR mutant models with 17-AAG alone,
full doses of 17-AAG and paclitaxel could be given without evidence
of additive toxicity, and the combination was significantly more
effective than either agent alone. These data suggest that Hsp90
inhibitors may be most effective in combination with cytotoxics in
lung adenocarcinoma patients with TKI-resistant EGFR mutations.

Results
17-AAG causes down-regulation of mutant forms of EGFR.
We and others have previously shown that Hsp90 inhibitors downregulate the expression of mutant forms of EGFR (27, 28). To
directly compare the effect of Hsp90 inhibition on the expression of
wild-type and mutant EGFR, we used NIH/3T3 cells stably
expressing either wild-type EGFR, L858R mutant EGFR, or EGFR
with a L747_E749 exon 19 deletion. An isogenic model was chosen
for these studies, as sensitivity of individual Hsp90 clients to 17AAG–induced degradation varies among cancer cell lines as a
result of differences in DT-diaphorase and Pgp expression (29, 30).
As shown in Fig. 1, both the L858R and exon 19 deletion EGFR
mutants were more sensitive to 17-AAG–induced degradation than
wild-type EGFR. Down-regulation of the mutant forms of EGFR
required lower concentrations of drug and occurred at markedly
earlier time points (3–6 h versus 12–24 h). The Hsp90 client Raf-1
was also notably less sensitive to 17-AAG–induced degradation
than mutant forms of EGFR. No difference in the sensitivity of Raf1 or other Hsp90 clients was observed in the wild-type and mutant
EGFR-transfected NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 1A and data not shown).
Similarly, 17-AAG treatment resulted in reduced expression of
mutant forms of EGFR in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (Fig. 2
and Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition to the L858R mutant
( found in H3255) and the E746_A750 deletion mutant ( found in
H1650), the expression of the L858R/T790M double mutant ( found
in H1975), which is resistant to erlotinib, was also down-regulated
in response to 17-AAG treatment. Loss of L858R/T790M EGFR
expression in H1975 cells was accompanied by inhibition of MAPK
and Akt signaling. The in vitro sensitivity of lung cancer cell lines to
17-AAG did not, however, correlate with EGFR mutational status.
Lung cancer cell lines with both mutant and wild-type EGFR were
sensitive to 17-AAG with IC50s ranging from 3 to 90 nmol/L. These
results are not surprising, as numerous proteins require Hsp90 and
are effectively degraded by 17-AAG in vitro. As an example, at 24 h,
both phospho-Akt and phospho-MAPK expression was downregulated by 17-AAG in Calu-1 cells (wild-type EGFR) despite the
minimal effect of 17-AAG on EGFR expression in these cells.
Inhibition of these pathways may be mediated by degradation of
upstream receptor tyrosine kinases that require Hsp90 for stability
or activation and/or by down-regulation of Raf-1 and Akt, both
of which are Hsp90 clients (13, 31).
17-AAG down-regulates the expression of mutant EGFR and
inhibits the growth of lung adenocarcinoma xenografts with
exons 19 and 21 mutations. Hsp90 inhibitors degrade a wide

Chemicals and antibodies. 17-AAG was obtained from Conforma
Therapeutics and dissolved in DMSO to yield 50 mg/mL stock solutions and
stored at 20jC. The EPL diluent was obtained from the Drug Synthesis
and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, National
Cancer Institute. Paclitaxel was obtained from Bristol-Myers Squibb and
stored at room temperature. Gefitinib was obtained from AstraZeneca
Pharmaceuticals. For cell culture studies, gefitinib was dissolved in DMSO
and stored at 20jC. For animal studies, it was dissolved in distilled water
with 0.5% lactic acid (85%; Fisher Scientific) to prepare a stock solution and
stored at 4jC. The following antibodies were used: EGFR, phosphorylated
EGFR (Y845, Y1068), Akt, phosphorylated Akt, p44/42 mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK), phosphorylated MAPK (Cell Signaling), Raf-1, cyclin
D1 (Santa Cruz), p85, and HER2 (Upstate Biotechnology).
Cell culture. All cell lines, except for NCI-H3255, were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. NCI-H3255 cells were provided by Drs. B.
Johnson and P. Janne (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute). A431 was maintained
in a 1:1 mixture of DME:F-12, A549 in F12K, and NCI-H441, H1650, H1666,
H1734, H1975, H3255, Calu-1, and Colo205 in RPMI 1640. All cells were
supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 50 units/mL each of penicillin
and streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts). NIH/
3T3 cells expressing wild-type and mutant EGFR were generated as
previously reported (4) and were maintained in puromycin (2 Ag/mL) and
DMEM supplemented with 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 50 units/mL each of
penicillin and streptomycin, and 10% calf serum (Life Technologies/
Invitrogen). For cell proliferation/viability studies, cells (2–4  103 per well)
were plated in 96-well plates. After 24 h, cells were treated with multiple
concentrations of drug and grown in the presence or absence of drug for
72 h. Cell viability was determined by using the AlamarBlue assay (TREK
Diagnostic Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the
plates were read by a fluorescence spectrophotometer. All experiments were
repeated at least three times.
Western blotting. Treated cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and
lysed in NP40 lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 1% NP40, 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 40 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 10 Ag/mL each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin
inhibitor] for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for
10 min, and the protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic
acid assay (Pierce Biotechnology). Total protein (50 Ag) was resolved by
SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were
probed with antibodies to detect the protein of interests overnight at 4jC.

Inhibition of Hsp90 in Mutant EGFR NSCLC

Figure 1. Mutant forms of EGFR are more sensitive than wild-type EGFR to 17-AAG–induced degradation. A, NIH-3T3 cells were stably transfected with wild-type
and mutant forms of EGFR (L858R and DL747_E749, A750P). Immunoblots of EGFR, Raf-1, and p85 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) show that mutant
forms of EGFR were degraded at earlier time points than wild-type EGFR after treatment with 0.1 Amol/L of 17-AAG. p85 PI3K, a protein unaffected by Hsp90 inhibition,
was included as a loading control. B, immunoblots of EGFR, Raf-1, and p85 PI3K, showing that lower concentrations of 17-AAG were required to down-regulate

To assess the kinetics of the effect of 17-AAG treatment on
mutant EGFR expression and downstream signaling, mice were
treated with a single dose of 75 mg/kg of 17-AAG and sacrificed
from 1 to 48 h posttreatment. The maximal effect of 17-AAG on
EGFR expression was observed between 3 and 12 h with recovery of
EGFR to baseline levels of expression by 48 h. The effect of 17-AAG
on the activity of the EGFR pathway, as assessed by the expression
of phosphorylated MAPK and Akt and cyclin D1 expression,
however, was less durable with recovery observed by 12 h (Fig. 3
and data not shown). The Hsp90 client proteins Raf-1 and Akt were
notably less sensitive to 17-AAG–induced degradation in these
models. Specifically, Raf-1 was only partially degraded by 17-AAG
(55% down-regulation at 6 h), and Akt expression was unaffected
by 17-AAG treatment in these model systems (Fig. 3). Finally,
treatment with 17-AAG had no effect on the expression of wild-type
EGFR in A549 xenografts. This insensitivity of wild-type EGFR to
17-AAG was not due to the inability of the compound to inhibit
Hsp90, as HER2 was potently degraded by 17-AAG in the A549
xenografts. These results highlight the wide variability in sensitivity
in vivo of the various Hsp90 clients.
As 17-AAG could effectively down-regulate the expression of
mutant forms of EGFR in xenograft tumors at nontoxic doses, we
assessed the antitumor effects of chronic treatment with 17-AAG in

promising activity in HER2-dependent breast cancer (32). In
contrast, mutant BRAF is less sensitive than HER2 to 17-AAG–
mediated degradation, and in vivo models of BRAF-dependent
melanomas are correspondingly less sensitive than HER2dependent breast tumors to 17-AAG as well (Supplementary
Fig. S2; refs. 17, 33).
To examine whether Hsp90 inhibitors were potentially relevant
for the treatment of tumors driven by mutant EGFR, we
determined the effects of 17-AAG on mutant and wild-type EGFR
expression in lung cancer xenografts in vivo. Mice bearing H1650
(DE746_A750 EGFR), H3255 (L858R EGFR), H1975 (L858R, T790M
EGFR), and A549 (wild type EGFR) xenografts were used in these
studies. Mice were initially treated by i.p. injection with a single
dose of 50 to 100 mg/kg of 17-AAG. Control mice were treated with
the EPL diluent vehicle alone. Mice were sacrificed 6 h after drug
treatment, and the expression of EGFR was compared in treated
and control mice. At 6 h, 17-AAG potently reduced the expression
of mutant EGFR (DE746_A750) by >95% in H1650 xenografts
(Fig. 3). Down-regulation of EGFR was accompanied by inhibition
of MAPK signaling and reduced cyclin D1 expression in the tumors.
Partial down-regulation of phosphorylated Akt expression was also
observed. Similar effects were observed in mice bearing H3255 and
H1975 xenografts (Fig. 3C and data not shown).

Figure 3. 17-AAG, at nontoxic doses, down-regulates mutant EGFR expression in xenograft tumors. For dose-response studies, mice were treated with either 50
or 75 mg/kg of 17-AAG and sacrificed 6 h later. In time course experiments mice were treated with a single dose of 75 mg/kg of 17-AAG and sacrificed at the time points
indicated (0–48 h). A, immunoblots of EGFR, Raf-1, Akt, and cyclin D1 in H1650 xenografts treated with 17-AAG. 17-AAG treatment resulted in a >95% reduction
in mutant EGFR expression and inhibition of AKT and MAPK activity in H1650 xenografts. Raf-1 was less sensitive than mutant EGFR to 17-AAG treatment,
and Akt expression was unaffected by 17-AAG. B, quantitation of the effects of 17-AAG on the expression of EGFR, Raf-1, and Akt in H1650 xenografts. MAPK,
a protein unaffected by Hsp90 inhibition, is included as a loading control. C, similar results were observed in H3255 and H1975 xenografts (C and data not shown).
D, 17-AAG does not induce the degradation of wild-type EGFR but does down-regulate the expression of HER2 in A549 xenografts.

Figure 4. 17-AAG inhibits the growth of EGFR mutant lung cancer xenogafts. Mice were treated with 17-AAG using one of two schedules: 75 mg/kg three times per
week either on alternating days (days 1, 3, and 5) or consecutive days (days 1–3; n = 5 mice per group). Only mice with H3255 xenografts were treated with gefitinib
at 150 mg/kg, 5/wk (days 1–5). A, 17-AAG significantly delayed the growth of H3255 but was less effective in this model than gefitinib, which induced significant
tumor regression (P < 0.01 for the comparison of 17-AAG to control or 17-AAG to gefitinib). B and C, 17-AAG alone inhibited the growth of H1650 and H1975
xenografts. Mice were randomized, and treatment was initiated at day 0. Bars, SE.

more effective than either agent alone (Fig. 5). To further assess the
mechanism of this effect, mice were sacrificed pretreatment and 24
and 48 h after the start of paclitaxel, 17-AAG, or the combination,
and the tumors were flash frozen. 17-AAG down-regulated the
expression of mutant EGFR in both the 17-AAG alone and 17-AAG/
paclitaxel combination arms (Fig. 6). Paclitaxel alone had no effect
on mutant EGFR expression. Apoptosis as measured by PARP
cleavage was observed in both the 17-AAG alone and 17-AAG/
paclitaxel arms but not in mice treated with paclitaxel alone.
Notably, the duration of this effect was longer in mice treated with
the combination (Fig. 6). These data suggest that 17-AAG can be
safely combined with paclitaxel and that the combination may be a
more effective treatment strategy than the use of 17-AAG alone in
patients whose tumor express mutant forms of EGFR.

mice with established H3255 (L858R EGFR), H1650 (DE746_A750
EGFR), H1975 (L858R, T790M EGFR), and A549 (wild-type EGFR)
xenografts (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S3). H3255 is sensitive to
the receptor TKI gefitinib (IC50 of 0.1 nmol/L), whereas H1650 and
H1975 are resistant to gefitinib (IC50s > 10 Amol/L). Mice were
treated with 75 mg/kg of 17-AAG using one of two schedules:
alternating days (days 1, 3, and 5 each week) or three consecutive
days (days 1–3) each week. These schedules were chosen based
upon our prior studies showing that more frequent dosing
schedules of 17-AAG were unacceptably toxic (11, 33). Mice with
established H3255 (L858R EGFR, gefitinib sensitive) xenografts
were also treated with gefitinib at a dose of 150 mg/kg (days 1–5
each week). 17-AAG treatment of H3255-bearing mice resulted in
marked growth delay (P = 0.01) but was less effective than gefitinib,
which induced significant tumor regression (P < 0.01). 17-AAG was
less active in H1650-bearing and H1975-bearing mice and had no
activity in the EGFR wild-type A549 model (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S3). As the H1650 and H1975 models are resistant to
gefitinib, the relative resistance of these models to 17-AAG may be
attributable to additional genetic alterations, which reduce their
dependence upon EGFR. For example, H1650 cells do not express
the tumor suppressor PTEN, a genetic alteration associated with
resistance to EGFR TKIs in patients with glioblastoma (34, 35).
17-AAG sensitizes EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma
xenografts to paclitaxel. As outlined above, 17-AAG can
effectively down-regulate mutant EGFR expression and inhibit
the growth of EGFR mutant xenografts. However, because of
toxicity limitations and its short half-life, continuous EGFR
inhibition in vivo was not possible with this agent. As 17-AAG
has previously been shown by us and others to enhance the activity
of cytotoxic agents (33, 36, 37), we asked whether 17-AAG could
enhance the activity of paclitaxel in lung cancer xenografts with
EGFR mutations. Mice with H1650 and H1975 xenografts were
treated with 25 mg/kg of paclitaxel weekly (on day 1 each week)
and/or 75 mg/kg of 17-AAG (on days 1–3 each week). Control mice
were treated with the vehicles alone. In mice bearing H1650 and
H1975 xenografts, the combination of paclitaxel and 17-AAG was

Discussion
Hsp90 is an abundant cellular chaperone that is required for
refolding of unfolded proteins, cellular survival under stress
conditions, and the conformational maturation of a variety of
proteins that play key roles in transducing proliferative and
antiapoptotic signals. The clinical development of inhibitors of
Hsp90 has been based upon two fundamental preclinical
observations. First, we and others have shown that inhibition
of Hsp90 is selectively toxic to tumor cells (38, 39). In tumor
cells, most Hsp90 is found in an active complex with cochaperones,
whereas most Hsp90 in normal tissues exists in a free,
uncomplexed, or latent state (39). Hsp90 in the active, cochaperone
bound complex has a higher affinity for geldanamycin and other
Hsp90 inhibitors compared with free, uncomplexed Hsp90 (38, 39).
These data likely explain in part the accumulation of 17-AAG and
other Hsp90 inhibitors in tumors. These observations also suggest
that Hsp90 may be ‘‘limiting’’ in tumor cells and may thus explain
in part the greater sensitivity of tumor versus normal cells to Hsp90
inhibitors. One prediction based upon these data is that Hsp90
inhibitors may have broad antitumor activity in a diverse range of
cancer types. The finding that Hsp90 is limiting in tumor cells may

Figure 5. Inhibition of Hsp90 by 17-AAG sensitizes H1650 and H1975 xenografts to paclitaxel. Mice with established H1650 (A ) and H1975 (B ) xenografts were
treated with paclitaxel weekly (day 1) at a dose of 25 mg/kg and with 17-AAG for three consecutive days each week (days 1–3). Control mice were treated with
the vehicles alone. Mice were treated with the drugs for a maximum of 30 d and then monitored. In mice with established H1650 xenografts, the combination of paclitaxel
and 17-AAG was significantly more effective than either 17-AAG or paclitaxel alone (P = 0.02 for paclitaxel/17-AAG versus paclitaxel). Five mice were treated per
group with the results then confirmed with a second cohort of mice (data not shown). Mice were randomized, and treatment was initiated at day 0. B, the combination of
17-AAG and paclitaxel was also more effective than either drug alone in mice with established H1975 tumors. Bars, SE.

expression of Ser473 phosphorylated AKT, was down-regulated by
17-AAG treatment. Inhibition of Akt activity by 17-AAG may be of
particular importance in this context, as Akt activation has been
shown to be EGFR-dependent and to promote cell survival in lung
cancer cell lines with EGFR mutations (40).
Notably, treatment with 17-AAG at its maximally tolerated dose
could only slow tumor growth in the H3255 (L858R EGFR)
xenograft model, and 17-AAG was less effective in this model than
the EGFR TKI gefitinib, which was capable of inducing complete
tumor regressions. The likely explanation for the limited efficacy of
17-AAG in this setting is that continuous down-regulation of

also explain the synergy observed between inhibitors of Hsp90 and
chemotherapy, radiation, and inducers of hypoxic stress.
A competing model is that Hsp90 inhibitors will have activity
only in a small subset of tumor types in which key aspects of
transformation are dependent upon a sensitive Hsp90-dependent
client, such as mutant EGFR. In support of this latter possibility, we
find significant variability in the sensitivity of individual Hsp90
client proteins to degradation by Hsp90 inhibitors. Whereas over
100 transcription factors, kinases, steroid receptors, and other
regulatory proteins have been shown to interact with Hsp90, our
animal studies suggest that only a fraction of these Hsp90 clients
are in fact degraded by Hsp90 inhibitors in vivo at nontoxic doses.
The mechanistic basis for this hierarchy of client sensitivity (i.e.,
the sensitivity of HER2 > mutant EGFR > Raf-1 > Akt > mutant
BRAF> wild-type EGFR) remains to be defined but may be due to
intrinsic difference between clients (i.e., client half-life) or to
differences in their binding to individual Hsp90 family members or
cochaperones. Identification of the subset of ‘‘most sensitive’’
Hsp90 clients may thus aid in choosing those patients most likely
to benefit from an Hsp90 inhibitor.
With this goal in mind, we compared the sensitivity of wild-type
and mutant EGFR to down-regulation by the Hsp90 inhibitor 17AAG. We chose 17-AAG for these studies, as it is currently being
tested in human clinical trials. We observed that both an exon 19
deletion mutant and the L858R exon 21 mutant were more
sensitive to 17-AAG–induced degradation than wild-type EGFR. In
studies using isogenic cells stably expressing either the wild-type or
mutant forms of EGFR, the mutant forms were degraded faster and
by lower concentrations of the inhibitor than the wild-type protein.
We further show, using xenograft model systems, that 17-AAG
could induce the down-regulation of mutant forms of EGFR but
not the wild-type protein in xenograft tumors at nontoxic doses
and that this was accompanied by antitumor effects in the EGFR
mutant models. The expression of Akt, which is also an Hsp90
client protein, was unaffected by treatment with nontoxic doses of
17-AAG. However, the activity of Akt, as measured by the

Inhibition of Hsp90 in Mutant EGFR NSCLC

because of toxicity, to continuously suppress Hsp90 function, the
full potential benefits of Hsp90 inhibition may be clinically
achievable when this inhibitor is used on an intermittent basis to
sensitize tumors to cytotoxics, such as paclitaxel.
In summary, our data suggest that Hsp90 inhibitors may be an
effective clinical strategy in patients whose tumors are dependent
upon mutant forms of EGFR. Our data, however, suggest that
17-AAG alone may have only limited activity in such patients and
that combination therapy with a cytotoxic may be a more effective
clinical strategy. Based upon these data, we initiated a phase 1 trial
of docetaxel and 17-AAG in patients with advanced cancer. In this
study, the two agents could be safely coadministered every 3 weeks,
and promising clinical activity has been observed on this trial in
patients with NSCLC (45). We therefore propose further studies of
Hsp90 inhibitors in combination with taxanes in lung cancer
patients whose tumors express activating mutations of EGFR.

mutant EGFR and EGFR signaling could not be achieved in mice.
The inability to continuously down-regulate EGFR activity is likely
attributable to the short half-life of 17-AAG in mice and the
inability to dose this agent chronically on a daily schedule due to
its hepatotoxicity (11). Our data, thus, provide a strong rationale for
the development of novel Hsp90 inhibitors with improved oral
bioavailability and less hepatotoxicity, which can be dosed using a
daily continuous schedule. Several synthetic small molecule Hsp90
inhibitors with these characteristics have now been developed, and
phase 1 trials of two such agents, CNF-2024 and SNX-5422, have
begun (38, 41).
Although the activity of 17-AAG as a single agent in EGFR
mutant tumors was modest, we did observe that 17-AAG and
paclitaxel could be safely combined without additive toxicity and
that the combination was more effective than either agent alone in
mice with established H1650 and H1975 tumors. We and others
have previously shown using multiple model systems, including
HER2-dependent breast and ovarian cancers, that the combination
of 17-AAG and paclitaxel is synergistic (37, 42, 43). In breast cancers
with HER2 amplification, enhancement is schedule dependent and
mediated by 17-AAG–induced down-regulation of Akt activity (33).
Notably, continuous inhibition of Hsp90 by 17-AAG was not
required in these studies to achieve a maximal effect with the
combination. In studies of the EGFR TKI gefitinib, pulsatile dosing
was also shown to be superior to continuous treatment when
combining this agent with paclitaxel (44). Therefore, whereas the
efficacy of 17-AAG as a single agent may be limited by its inability,
