BACKGROUND: The combination of pentostatin (P), cyclophosphamide (C), and rituximab (R) achieved an overall
response (OR) rate >90%, with >40% complete responses (CRs) in patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). METHODS: To evaluate whether the tolerability of this regimen could be enhanced without sacrificing
efficacy, a phase 2 trial was conducted of P and R without C, using a higher P dose (4 mg/m2). Among the 33
patients enrolled, 82% were male, the median age was 65 years (9 patients were aged 70 years), and 64% were
classified as having Rai stage III to IV disease. RESULTS: The OR rate was 76%, with 9 CRs (27%), 5 nodular partial
responses, and 11 partial responses (PRs) reported. At the time of last follow-up, 29 of 33 patients were still alive at a
median follow-up of 14 months (range, 1-34.8 months). Four (12%) patients experienced grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity, and 5 (15%) experienced grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity. Comparison of this trial with the
previous PCR trial demonstrated that patients treated with PCR had a higher OR rate (91% vs 76%) and CR rate (41%
vs 27%) compared with patients treated with PR. The median treatment-free survival for all accrued patients was
notably longer in patients treated with PCR compared with PR (30 months vs 16 months). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study suggest that increasing the dose of the purine nucleoside analogue does not eliminate the

KEYWORDS: pentostatin, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, chemoimmunotherapy, response rates, B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia.

The treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has had significant advances over the past decade. In particular, the improvement in both overall response (OR) rates and complete response (CR) rates with chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) for patients with previously untreated CLL has been most impressive. CLL CIT regimens typically are
comprised of a purine nucleoside (fludarabine or pentostatin), an alkylating agent (cyclophosphamide), and a monoclonal
antibody (rituximab). The most widely tested regimens in phase 2 trials include fludarabine and rituximab (FR); fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR); and pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (PCR).1-3 Although
the OR rates for these regimens are all 90%, the CR rates observed in phase 2 trials with these regimens were quite varied, with a CR rate of 72% for FCR, 33% for FR (before rituximab consolidation), and 41% for PCR reported.2-4
Despite their virtues, these CIT regimens have substantial toxicity, particularly among patients with compromised
performance status or comorbid health problems. Treatment-related toxicity limits the use of CIT in many CLL patients,
because the median age at the time of diagnosis of CLL is approximately 70 years. In general, there are 3 solutions to this
dilemma: 1) limit CIT administration to younger patients, 2) select only elderly patients with good performance status
and preserved organ function to receive CIT, and 3) develop CIT regimens with a high degree of efficacy that can be tolerated by elderly patients.
As part of our effort to pursue the last of these strategies, we developed the PCR regimen using pentostatin (P; at a
dose of 2 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (C; at a dose of 600 mg/m2), and rituximab (R; at a dose of 375 mg/m2).3 Unlike

FCR,1,5,6 the PCR regimen using the 2 mg/m2 P dose is
well tolerated by patients aged >70 years as well as those
with mildly reduced creatinine clearance.7 Nonetheless,
PCR remains an aggressive treatment regimen that cannot
be tolerated by all elderly CLL patients in need of treatment. In an effort to improve tolerability while preserving
efficacy, we conducted a follow-up trial testing the combination of P and R without C and using a higher P dose
(4 mg/m2).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
This phase 2 study enrolled patients at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota, and The Ohio State University in
Columbus, Ohio. The clinical trial included correlative
laboratory analysis designed to assess risk-stratification parameters and estimation of minimal residual disease
(MRD). Patients were required to have previously
untreated CLL and to meet the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) Working Group 1996 criteria8 to initiate treatment. Patients had relatively preserved renal (creatinine
clearance 1.5  upper limit of normal [ULN]) and hepatic function (bilirubin 3.0  ULN), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
of 0 to 3, and no other neoplasms with the exception of
squamous cell or basal cell skin cancers or carcinoma in
situ of the cervix. The protocol was reviewed and
approved by the Institutional Review Board at each participating institution. All patients were required to provide
written informed consent before entry on this study, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Study Design
Study participants received 6 cycles of P (4 mg/m2) and R
administered intravenously every 21 days. P was given on
the first day of each cycle after infusion of R. R was given
at a dose of 100 mg intravenously (iv) on Day 1, and then
375 mg/m2 iv on Days 3 and 5 of the first treatment cycle.
During Cycles 2 to 6, R was given at a dose of 375 mg/m2
as a single iv infusion on Day 1. Treatment was discontinued in cases of progressive disease (PD) or excessive toxicity. Prophylactic sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and
acyclovir were given to all patients for 1 year starting with
the first cycle of therapy. All patients were also given filgrastim on Day 3 of each treatment cycle for 5 consecutive
days or until the total neutrophil count was >1.0  109/L
(1000/lL) for 2 consecutive days.

Dose Modifications
The first cycle was administered at full dose regardless of
pre-existing cytopenias. At the time of retreatment for
Cycles 2 to 6, P was delayed for 1 week for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <1000 lL or a platelet count (PLT)
<50,000 lL. If counts recovered to these levels after the
delay, P was given at full dose. If counts partially recovered (ANC, 500-1000 or PLT, 30,000-50,000), P was
resumed at a dose of 1 mg/m2. If counts did not recover to
at least an ANC >500 and/or PLT >30,000 after a 1week delay or patients experienced  grade 3 organ toxicity or grade 4 gastrointestinal toxicity, treatment was discontinued. PLT and hemoglobin adverse events were
graded according to the CLL Working Group grading
scale for hematologic toxicity.8 All other adverse events
were graded according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 2.0).
Risk-Stratification Parameters
The following prognostic factors were evaluated on pretreatment specimens: CD38 expression, fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH)-detectable cytogenetic defects,
immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IgVH)
mutation status, and ZAP-70 expression. These risk-stratification parameters were performed on peripheral blood
cells from all patients as they enrolled in the clinical trial
and were evaluated using previously published methods.9
Criteria for Response Level
Response was evaluated using the NCI Working Group
1996 criteria.8 Response bone marrow biopsies were collected 2 months after Day 1 of Cycle 6 and at the time of
first disease recurrence. After the completion of therapy,
patients were followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, or until disease progression.
Estimation of MRD
Patients with CR, nodular partial response (nPR), or partial response (PR) also had peripheral blood MRD evaluation for CLL B-cells using 2-color and 3-color flow
cytometry at the time of the 2-month post-treatment
bone marrow collection. Peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) were separated from heparinized venous
blood by density gradient centrifugation. To remove adherent cells, PBMCs were suspended in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and incubated in
plastic dishes at 37 C for 1 hour before collection of nonadherent cells. These isolated PBMCs were then used for
flow cytometry analysis. The 2-color flow involved

determination of the percentage of cells positive for CD5
and CD19. The PBMCs were stained by a 2-color (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]/phycoerythrin [PE]) flow
cytometric assay. FITC-conjugated and PE-conjugated
anti-CD19 or anti-CD5 (BD Biosciences, San Diego,
Calif) was used to determine the presence of CD5-positive/CD19-positive B cells. Mouse immunoglobulin (Ig)
G1 and IgG2 (BD Biosciences) were included as isotype
controls. A 2-color flow cytometry negative status was
defined as patients with 1% positive CD5-positive/
CD19-positive cells. The 3-color flow cytometry was a
combination of the anti-CD5 and CD19 reagents as
described above with addition of an anti-CD79b monoclonal antibody.10 Our laboratory has determined that
normal individuals have 1% positive CD5-positive/
CD19-positive/CD79b-negative cells with 3-color flow
cytometry. Thus, to be considered negative for the 3-color
MRD assay, patients had to have 1% CD5-positive/
CD19-positive/CD79b-negative cells in their blood.

Statistical Methods
A single-stage phase 2 trial with an interim analysis was
conducted in patients with previously untreated B-cell
CLL to assess the toxicity and efficacy of the combination
of PR. The primary endpoint was the CR rate. A total of
30 evaluable patients were required to test the null hypothesis that the true CR rate is at most 25% versus the alternative that it is at least 50%. Assuming that the number
of CRs is binomially distributed, the study had 87%
power, with a 5% Type I error rate. A patient was considered evaluable for response if they were eligible and
received treatment regardless of the number of cycles they
received. The proportion of CR was estimated by the
number of patients who achieved a CR divided by the
total number of evaluable patients. The 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for the true CR rate
using the Duffy-Santner approach. The duration of
response was defined as the time from the date a response
was first achieved until the date of disease progression.
Treatment-free survival (TFS) was defined as the time
from the date of completion of treatment until the date of
initiation of subsequent treatment or death. The distributions of duration of response and TFS were estimated
using the method of Kaplan-Meier.11 Differences
between groups were evaluated using the Fisher exact test,
Wilcoxon rank sum test, and Kruskal-Wallis test when
appropriate. Overall significance was declared for P <.05.

RESULTS
Patient Demographics
Thirty-three patients were enrolled at the Mayo Clinic
and the Ohio State University between July 2005 and
February 2008. All 33 patients were eligible. The characteristics of the 33 patients relative to our previous
PCR cohort are presented in Table 1. Twenty-seven
(82%) patients were male, and the median age was
65 years (range, 45-81 years). Nine patients (27%)
were aged 70 years. The majority of patients (21 of
33; 64%) had Rai stage III or IV disease at study
entry. Prognostic testing revealed that 36% of patients
were CD38-positive, 50% of patients were ZAP-70positive, and 39% of patients were IgVH unmutated.
Chromosomal analysis by FISH found that 61%,
27%, and 3% of patients had 1, 2, or 3 FISH defects,
respectively. FISH risk category using the Dohner classification12 is shown in Table 1. Overall, patient characteristics were similar to the prior PCR cohort9 with
the exception that PR-treated patients were less likely
to be IgVH unmutated (39% vs 70%; P ¼ .006) and
had higher leukocyte counts (median 127  109/L vs
79  109/L; P ¼ .04). Bone marrow biopsy at study
entry revealed that 36% of patients had a diffuse pattern of bone marrow involvement, whereas 3%, 6%,
and 55% had a nodular, interstitial, or nodular and
interstitial pattern, respectively.

Toxicity and Tolerability
At the time of last follow-up, all patients had completed active treatment. Patients received a median of
6 cycles (range, 1-6 cycles) of treatment, with 28 of
33 patients (85%) completing the intended 6 cycles
of therapy. Five patients discontinued therapy early
due to pleural effusions (1 patient), grade 4 neutropenia (1 patient), cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation
(1 patient), refusal (1 patient), and other unspecified
medical problems (1 patient). While receiving treatment, 6 of 33 patients (18%) experienced a dose
delay due to hematologic toxicity (4 patients), bronchitis (1 patient), or urinary retention (1 patient).
One patient (3%) had P withheld for 1 cycle due to
a rash, and a second patient (3%) had a P dose
reduction for 1 cycle due to a hematologic adverse
event.
Overall, 5 patients (15%) had a grade 3 or 4 hematologic adverse event, and 8 patients (24%) had a grade
3 or 4 nonhematologic adverse event. Focusing only on

nonhematologic toxicity. All grade 3 or 4 toxicities are
summarized in Table 2. The most common grade 3 or 4
toxicities were hematologic, for which 2 patients had
grade 3 thrombocytopenia and 2 patients had grade 3 or 4
neutropenia. One patient developed grade 2 hemolysis
during cycle 2 that was believed to be possibly related to
study treatment. This patient remained on treatment and

PR. Thus, the OR rate (CR þ nPR þ PR) was 76% (95%
CI, 59-88%). Of the 25 patients who responded to treatment, the median time to first documentation of any
response (ie, CR or PR) was 2 cycles (range, 1-6 cycles).
At the time of last follow-up, 4 patients (12%) had
died and 17 patients (52%) experienced disease progression. Deaths were due to disease progression (2 patients),
stroke (1 patient), and bilobar pneumonia with sepsis and
acute renal failure (1 patient). The median follow-up time
for patients still alive was 14 months (range, 1-34.8
months). The median duration of response was 10.8
months (95% CI, 9.7-19.6 months), and 12 of the 25 responders have developed disease progression. Thirteen of
33 patients were retreated after completing PR therapy.
The median time to subsequent treatment for these 13
patients was 13.6 months (range, 2.1-25.5 months). The
median TFS was 15.8 months (95% CI, 13.6-20.6
months).
Assessment of MRD After Treatment
Twenty-five patients were assessed for MRD using both
2-color and 3-color flow cytometry. The 2-color and 3color flow cytometry gave similar results, with only 3
patients (2 with a CR and 1 with a PR) achieving a MRDnegative status in the peripheral blood on both the 2-color
and 3-color flow cytometry.
Correlative Prognostic Factors for Predicting
Treatment Outcome
To evaluate whether PR was equally effective in older
patients (aged 70 years) and individuals with various
prognostic risk markers, we analyzed response by patient‘s

2184

pretreatment characteristics. Comparison of response and
TFS were performed for the following groups: IgVH
mutational status (98% vs >98% from germline
sequence in which 98% was designated as unmutated),
CD38-positive versus CD38-negative patients (30% cutoff), ZAP-70-positive versus ZAP-70-negative patients
(20% cutoff), and comparison of high-risk (del(17p13.1)
or del(11q22.3)) versus low-risk/intermediate-risk
(del(13q14), trisomy (þ) 12, or normal) FISH groups.
Similar to our prior results with PCR,3 no correlation
between attaining a CR or nPR was observed for any
prognostic factors. The estimated median TFS was longer
in patients who had low-risk/intermediate-risk FISH
compared with patients who had 11q22.3 deletion (median, 15.9 vs 7.9 months; P ¼ .001) or patients with highrisk FISH (median, 15.9 months vs 10.8 months; P ¼
.01). At the time of last follow-up, no differences in TFS
were noted between risk groups for IgVH mutation,
CD38, ZAP-70, or age (Table 3).
Comparison With PCR
It should be emphasized that analysis of outcomes among
PR-treated patients compared with those treated with
PCR represent comparison of 2 sequential phase 2 trials
rather than a randomized study. However, the eligibility
criteria were nearly identical between PR and PCR and
enrollment accrued at the same 2 academic centers over a
very short time interval. Patients in the 2 studies were generally similar with respect to all demographic and prognostic characteristics, although patients in the PR study
were less likely to be IgVH unmutated. Based on these
similarities, we conducted a comparison of the response
rates and TFS of all evaluable patients on the 2 studies in
an exploratory manner. Patients treated with PCR had a
higher OR rate (91% vs 76%) and CR rate (41% vs 27%)
compared with patients treated with PR. Similarly, the
median TFS was notably longer in patients treated with
PCR compared with PR (30 months vs 16 months)
(Fig. 1). For all responders, the median duration of
response on PCR was 34 months (95% CI, 29- not
reached) and the median duration of response for PR was
10.8 months (95% CI, 9.1-19.2 months). Because indirect evidence from other trials suggests that C may be particularly important in patients with 11q-, we also
compared PR with PCR among those without this cytogenetic defect. The differences in OR, CR, and TFS were
found to be of similar magnitude to those of the overall
cohort when analysis was limited to patients without
11q-. The grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity rate was

DISCUSSION
The development of chemoimmunotherapy has been a
major treatment advance for patients with CLL. The current trial of P and R was designed to enhance the tolerability of P-based chemoimmunotherapy in the hopes of
broadening the availability of CIT to elderly patients with
CLL. The trial design eliminated C while doubling the
dose of P from 2 mg to 4 mg/m2 but retained a similar
schedule and length. Indeed the PR regimen was generally
well tolerated with limited grade 3 to 4 toxicities. As
expected, toxicity was primarily hematologic. However,
in this current trial with PR, similar to the PCR trial, there
was no need for blood product transfusion support during
induction. Despite these virtues, the CR rate and TFS of
the PR approach appear inferior to that of our prior
reported experience with PCR. These differences were
found to be independent of the presence of 11q- on FISH
or the presence of bulky lymph node disease, suggesting
that C remains an important component of P-based CIT

the 2 studies lend credibility to the comparison. The findings are also consistent with the results of several randomized phase 3 trials that indicate the combination of C and
F leads to superior OR and CR rates as well as progression-free survival compared with F monotherapy.13-15
The recently completed German CLL study group CLL 8
trial suggests that FCR appears superior to FC combination therapy.16 The CR rate in the FCR arm of the CLL 8
trial was 44.5%, which is substantially lower than the
72% CR rate in the phase 2 experience of The University
of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.1 In the CLL8
trial, although FCR was found to be superior to FC for
CR, the overall survival was not.16 Of note, only the FCR
regimen reported by The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center and the FCR-lite trials have
reported CRs of >70%1,17 Importantly, the ongoing
North American Intergroup Trial directly compares the
FCR and FR regimens and will help provide definitive
evidence regarding the need of C in FR-based CIT.
One potential issue for the F-based CIT regimens is
that there are often significant cytopenias both during and
after the use of FCR for CLL patients, resulting in greater
than half of the patients aged >65 years not being able to
receive 6 complete cycles.4 In contrast, we have found that
the PCR regimen is well tolerated by CLL patients aged
>70 years.7 In addition, we have recently found that as
many as 25% of all CLL patients will not fit eligibility criteria for entry into CLL clinical trials and this group does
not subsequently fare well clinically.18 Clearly, whereas
CIT approaches have significant clinical impact for previously untreated CLL patients in terms of OR and CR,
there is a need to have a continued evaluation by means of
randomized clinical trials of the efficacy of each CIT regimen for CLL population for which age and comorbidity
are taken into consideration.
Despite the apparently inferior CR rate and TFS of
PR relative to PCR, the favorable toxicity profile of PR
suggests that PR may be a treatment option for elderly
patients who would not be candidates for 3-drug combination chemoimmunotherapy. In this regard, it should be
noted that the OR and CR rates observed with first-line
PR appear to be substantially better than those observed
with first-line chlorambucil19-21 or lenalidomide22,23 and
similar to those of first-line alemtuzumab19 or
bendamustine.21
In summary, the PR combination is a well-tolerated
and highly active treatment regimen, certainly in comparison to other more traditional regimens such as chlorambucil, for patients with previously untreated CLL.

Nonetheless, the regimen appears to have lower overall
and complete remission rates as well as a shorter treatment-free survival when compared with the PCR regimen.
Continued
efforts
to
develop
new
chemoimmunotherapy platforms that can be tolerated by
elderly CLL patients are needed.
