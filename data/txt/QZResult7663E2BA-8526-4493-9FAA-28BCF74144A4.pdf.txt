Abstract
The human inducible nitric oxide synthase (hiNOS) gene is
regulated by nuclear factor KB (NF-KB) and has recently been
shown to be a target of the Wnt/B-catenin pathway. In this
study, we tested the hypothesis that Wnt/B-catenin signaling
might regulate cytokine- or tumor necrosis factor A (TNFA)–
induced hiNOS expression through interaction with NF-KB. A
cytokine mixture of TNFA + interleukin (IL)-1B + IFN;
induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in hiNOS promoter activity in
HCT116 and DLD1 colon cells, but produced a 2-fold decrease
in SW480 colon cancer cells. A similar differential activity was
seen in liver cancer cells (HepG2, Huh7, and Hep3B).
Overexpression of B-catenin produced a dose-dependent
decrease in NF-KB reporter activity and decreased cytokine
mixture–induced hiNOS promoter activity. Gel shift for TNFAinduced hiNOS NF-KB activation showed decreased p50
binding and decreased NF-KB reporter activity in the Bcatenin–mutant HAB18 cells. Conversely, enhanced p50
binding and increased NF-KB reporter activity were seen in
HAB85 cells, which lack B-catenin signaling. Coimmunoprecipitation confirmed that B-catenin complexed with both p65
and p50 NF-KB proteins. NF-KB–dependent Traf1 protein
expression also inversely correlated with the level of Bcatenin. Furthermore, SW480 cells stably transformed with
wild-type adenomatous polyposis coli showed decreased Bcatenin protein and increased TNFA-induced p65 NF-KB
binding as well as iNOS and Traf1 expression. Finally, Bcatenin inversely correlated with iNOS and Fas expression
in vivo in hepatocellular carcinoma tumor samples. Our
in vitro and in vivo data show that B-catenin signaling
inversely correlates with cytokine-induced hiNOS and other
NF-KB–dependent gene expression. These findings underscore
the complex role of Wnt/B-catenin, NF-KB, and iNOS signaling
in the pathophysiology of inflammation-associated carcinogenesis. [Cancer Res 2009;69(9):3764–71]

signaling in the development of human cancers, especially colon
cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (2, 3). In colon cancer,
mutation of the tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis
coli (APC) leads to stabilization of transcriptional regulator hcatenin, which accumulates in the cytoplasm, enters the nucleus,
and interacts with nuclear T-cell factor 4 (Tcf-4)/lymphoid
enhancer factor (LEF) to activate transcription of specific target
genes leading to cell proliferation and carcinogenesis (4–6).
Nitric oxide (NO) is a diverse biological mediator with important
roles in vascular biology, inflammation, and tumor biology (7–9).
Studies have shown that NO promotes carcinogenesis at low levels
and that NO inhibits tumor growth at high concentrations (10–12).
NO has been shown to cause DNA damage and is mutagenic (13).
Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been documented in
cancer specimens (14) and precancerous chronic inflammatory
conditions (15, 16). Several studies have also investigated the
relationship between iNOS expression, vascular endothelial growth
factor, and the tumor suppressor gene product p53 (17, 18).
Exposure of human cancer cells to a NO donor resulted in p53
protein accumulation, which then acted in a negative feedback
loop to trans-repress human iNOS (hiNOS) gene transcription
in vitro and in vivo (19, 20). Hence, the double-edged sword of
NO in tumor biology clearly depends on cell type, NO concentration, oxidative stress, and tumor milieu (21, 22).
The expression of iNOS is predominantly regulated at the
transcriptional level by inflammatory cytokines that signal through
nuclear factor nB (NF-nB) and other nuclear factors (23–27). NF-nB
is also an important transcriptional factor that is involved in
colorectal carcinogenesis (28, 29). Recently, we have shown that the
hiNOS gene is up-regulated by Wnt/h-catenin signaling (30).
Overexpression of h-catenin and Tcf-4 increased basal and
cytokine-induced iNOS promoter activity in cancer cells that was
dependent on intact cis-acting Tcf-4 binding element (TBE) motifs
in the hiNOS promoter (30). However, another study has shown
that h-catenin physically interacts with NF-nB and inhibits its
activation in human colon and breast cancer (31). Therefore, we
examined the effect of h-catenin signaling on NF-nB activation and
tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa)–induced iNOS expression in
human colon, liver, and lung cancer cells. Our findings indicate that
h-catenin differentially regulates TNFa-induced hiNOS and other
NF-nB target gene expression by physical interaction with NF-nB in
colon and liver cancer cells.

DC; ref. 32). They were cultured at 37jC in 5% CO2 in medium containing
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Clontech), 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin, and 15 mmol/L HEPES. SW480, DLD1, RKO, and 293 cells
were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen), and HCT116, HAh18, and HAh85 in
McCoy’s 5A medium (Invitrogen). Unless indicated, cells were stimulated
with a cytokine mixture consisting of 1,000 units/mL human TNF-a (R&D
Systems), 100 units/mL IL-1h (R&D Systems), and 250 units/mL human
IFNg (R&D Systems or Roche Pharmaceuticals).
Plasmid constructs. The hiNOS 5.8 kb NF-nB-luciferase reporter
plasmid (2 NF-nB; ref. 25), hiNOS 5.8 kb NF-nB oligonucleotide cloned
into the unique Sma1 site of luciferase reporter plasmid pT109, which contains 109 bp of the herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter, driving expression of firefly luciferase, was confirmed by sequencing. NF-nB 5.8 wild-type
(WT), 5¶-AGAGGGCTTTCCCAGAACCA-3¶; NF-nB 5.8 mutant, 5¶-AGAGGGCTCGCCCAGAACCA-3¶ (25). The reporter plasmids pTOP-FLASH and
pFOP-FLASH, WT APC expression vector (PCMV-neo-APC), and h-catenin
expression vector (PCI-neo h-catenin) were kindly provided by Dr. Bert
Vogelstein. Expression plasmids encoding human p50 and FLAG-taggep65
(pFL65) NF-nB proteins were kindly provided by Dr. Joseph DiDonato
(Department of Cancer Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH;
ref. 33).
Transient transfection assay. DNA transfections of cells were carried
out in six-well plates (Corning) by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) and
MIRUS Trans-IT reagent (Mirus) as previously described (30). To control for
transfection efficiency between groups, 0.5 Ag of a plasmid containing a
cytomegalovirus promoter–driven h-galactosidase was added to each well.
pRSV-Luc was used as positive control, and the promoterless plasmid pXP2
served as negative control. RKO h-catenin S33Y stable transfectants were
established by transfection with h-catenin S33Y plasmid (2). Stable
transfectants in SW480 cells were established by transfection with fulllength APC plasmid (2).
Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot were done as described previously (30).
Antibodies used for Western blot were rabbit anti-hiNOS polyclonal (BD
Biosciences), h-catenin (H-102), p65 (A), p50 (c-19), TRAF1 (H-132, Santa
Cruz), and mouse anti–h-catenin monoclonal (Sigma).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Nuclear protein extraction and
gel shift assay were done as previously described (30). Antibody supershifts
used 0.5 to 2 Ag of anti-p65 (A)X (Santa Cruz) and anti-p50 (NLS)X (Santa
Cruz).
Immunofluorescent staining. Cells were cultured on coverslips and
washed twice with cold PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for
15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 10% FBS in PBS for
30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with the specific primary
antibodies for p50 (Santa Cruz), h-catenin (Sigma), APC (BD), iNOS(BD),
and cleaved PARP (Asp214, Cell Signaling; ref. 30). Slides were viewed with
Olympus Provis and Leica TSL-SL microscopes.
Immunohistochemistry. Tissue samples were deparaffinized and
subjected to alcohol gradient and washed thrice, then treated with 0.3%
H2O2 in methanol followed by 10% horse serum for 30 min. Sections were
incubated overnight with primary antibodies h-catenin (Sigma; 1:200
dilution), Fas (CH11 Upstate; 1:150 dilution), or iNOS (Abcam; 1:150
dilution) and then with secondary antibodies Bio-antimouse and rabbit IgG
(1:200 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature; signal was detected using
ABC Elite Kit (Vector Laboratories).
NO production assessment. Culture supernatants were collected and
assayed for nitrite, a stable end product of NO oxidation, using the Griess
reaction as described (34).
Statistical methods. Data are presented as the mean F SE. Cultures
were done in duplicate or triplicate, and experiments were done at least
thrice. Data were analyzed by the Student t test or ANOVA, and P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Results
B-Catenin inversely correlated with cytokine-induced iNOS
expression. To examine the level of cytokine-induced iNOS gene

expression in HCT116, DLD1, and SW480 cell lines, we transfected
the cells with the WT hiNOS 7.2 kb luciferase promoter plasmid
and then treated them with a cytokine mixture of TNFa + IL-1h +
IFNg for 6 hours. The cytokine mixture induced hiNOS promoter
activity in HCT116 and DLD1 cells, but significantly decreased hiNOS
promoter activity below basal levels in SW480 cells (Fig. 1A). This
was an unexpected finding and led us to investigate in other human
cell lines. A similar differential expression of cytokine-induced hiNOS
transcription was seen in HepG2 cells compared with Huh7 and
Hep3B liver cancer cells, where again cytokine mixture stimulation
decreased hiNOS promoter activity below basal levels (Fig. 1B). We
also observed that the magnitude of cytokine-induced NO production was quite different, being dramatically increased in primary
human and rat hepatocytes, lower in HepG2 and DLD1 cells, and no
appreciable NO synthesis detectable by nitrate assay in SW480 cells
(Fig. 1C). Interestingly, endogenous h-catenin expression was high in
the SW480 cells and lower in the HCT116 and DLD1 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). These observations led us to hypothesize
that the presence of h-catenin might inversely correlate and regulate
cytokine-induced iNOS expression, possibly through interaction with
the NF-nB pathway.
B-Catenin reduced TNFA-induced hiNOS-specific NF-KB
reporter and binding activities. To determine whether h-catenin
interacts with NF-nB and regulates hiNOS expression, we
synthesized hiNOS-specific 5.8 kb NF-nB oligonucleotides and
constructed two tandem copies of the NF-nB element at 5.8 kb in
the hiNOS promoter for use in gel shift assay, as well as hiNOSspecific NF-nB reporter plasmid driving the minimal herpes
thymidine kinase-luciferase promoter. We initially determined the
effects of h-catenin overexpression on NF-nB p65–mediated
activation of the hiNOS NF-nB reporter. A p65 expression plasmid
(0.2 Ag) was cotransfected with increasing doses of h-catenin
expression plasmid (mutant h-cateninS33Y) along with the hiNOS
NF-nBx2 reporter. h-Catenin overexpression inhibited the p65
activation of hiNOS NF-nB reporter in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2A). h-Catenin overexpression also abrogated the cytokine
mixture–induced hiNOS promoter activity in the HCT116, DLD1,
and HepG2 cells previously noted and actually produced a 30% to
50% drop in luciferase activity compared with basal cells (Fig. 2B).
These findings suggest that h-catenin can antagonize cytokinemediated induction of the NF-nB–dependent hiNOS gene.
Next, we examined for h-catenin/Tcf-4 transcriptional activity in
HCT116 cells (h-catenin WT/mut) compared with HAh18 (del/mut)
and HAh85 (WT/del) cell lines (32) by pTOP/pFOP transfection. The
HAh85 (WT/del) cells lack h-catenin signaling due to deletion of the
mutant h-catenin allele. In these studies, the WT h-catenin is subject
to degradation, whereas the mutant h-catenin is stabilized and
active for nuclear translocation. The pTOP expression plasmid is a
positive reporter plasmid for h-catenin transcriptional activity
(containing three copies of an optimal Tcf binding motif), whereas
the pFOP is a negative control mutant expression reporter. As predicted, the presence of a mutant h-catenin allele increased
h-catenin/Tcf-4 transcriptional activity (pTOP reporter activity) in
HCT116 and HAh18 cell lines, but not in HAh85 cells (Fig. 3A). As a
negative control, the pFOP reporter was used and did not show any
h-catenin activation. TNFa stimulation of the HAh18 cells reduced
resting hiNOS-specific NF-nB reporter activity below basal level,
whereas it induced NF-nB reporter activity in the HAh85 cells that
lacked h-catenin signaling (Fig. 3B). Dominance of the mutant
h-catenin in the HAh18 cells also suppressed TNFa-induced p50 DNA
binding (Fig. 3C, lane 4, lower band). Immunofluorescent staining

also indicated that activated h-catenin decreased TNFa-induced
NF-nB p50 translocation to the nucleus of HAh18 cells, compared
with abundant p50 staining in the HAh85 cells (Fig. 3D), which is
consistent with the h-catenin–mediated repression of NF-nB
reporter activity and gel shift binding (Fig. 3B and C).
Inactivation of B-catenin by integrating full-length APC in
SW480 restored NF-KB activity. To support our hypothesis that
high level of h-catenin was inhibiting NF-nB–mediated gene
activation, we generated stably transformed SW480 cells overexpressing the APC gene. Because the SW480 cells contain a
truncated APC gene and exhibited very high constitutive h-catenin
levels (Supplementary Fig. S1A), we reasoned that adding back fulllength APC could bind and degrade h-catenin in the multiprotein
complex. If so, then NF-nB–mediated gene transcription should be
restored in SW480-APC cells compared with control SW480-vector
cells. Immunoblot of stably transformed SW480-APC cells showed
strong APC, decreased h-catenin, and increased hiNOS protein
compared with the SW480 cells expressing empty vector (Fig. 4A,
top). In addition, overexpression of APC led to decreased h-catenin
transcriptional activity with pTOP transfection (Fig. 4A, bottom).
This was also consistent with the immunofluorescent staining, with
SW480-APC exhibiting decreased h-catenin and increased iNOS
staining (Fig. 4B). Likewise, SW480-APC showed a higher level of
TNFa-induced p65 binding on gel shift (Fig. 4C), as well as
increased TNFa-induced hiNOS mRNA and protein expressions
(Fig. 4D). In general, iNOS protein exists as a homodimer. However,
a doublet type of iNOS protein band is often exhibited in published
Western blots, and some authors have suggested that the lower
band may reflect monomers or iNOS degradation products (35).
B-Catenin physically interacts with NF-KB subunits in colon
cancer cells. To document that h-catenin was physically binding
to NF-nB proteins, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experi-

ments. The SW480 cells have strong h-catenin expression, DLD1
and HCT116 have moderate h-catenin expression, whereas the
RKO cells show nearly undetectable h-catenin protein levels
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). On coimmunoprecipitation, h-catenin
complexed with both p50 and p65 (Supplementary Fig. S1B). This
confirms a direct interaction of h-catenin with NF-nB subunits in
these cells, as has been shown in other cells (31), and provides a
potential regulatory mechanism for modulating NF-nB signaling.
We also performed immunoprecipitation of cell lysates from
primary human hepatocytes and HepG2 cells and found that
h-catenin complexed with either p65 or p50 (data not shown).
Effects of B-catenin on NF-KB–mediated transcription
in other target genes. To show that the inhibitory effects of
h-catenin on NF-nB activity were not limited to hiNOS, we also
examined Traf1 gene expression, which is known to be regulated by
NF-nB activity (31). Strong TNFa-induced Traf1 protein was seen
in the HAh85 cells that lack significant h-catenin transcriptional
activity, whereas the HAh18 cells did not show inducible Traf1
expression (Fig. 5A). Similarly, the RKO cancer cell line, which lacks
h-catenin protein (Supplementary Fig. S1A), also showed strong
TNFa-mediated Traf1 expression (Fig. 5B). In agreement with the
notion of h-catenin–mediated inhibition of NF-nB activation, we
also generated RKO cells stably transformed to overexpress hcatenin and observed a significant down-regulation of TNFainduced Traf1 protein expression (Fig. 5C). Finally, consistent with
h-catenin degradation by APC binding, inducible Traf1 expression
was shown in the SW480-APC cells, but not in the control SW480vector cells that exhibit high h-catenin (Fig. 5D).
B-Catenin inhibited NO-induced apoptosis in HAB18 cells.
To test the relationship between h-catenin and NO-induced
apoptosis, HAh18 and HAh85 cells were treated with the NO
donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine. The results showed that NO

induced activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 6A) and PARP (Fig. 6B) in the
HAh85 cells, but not in the HAh18 cells, and suggests that the
presence of mutated h-catenin in the HAh18 cells inhibits NOinduced apoptosis. A recent study also reported similar findings in
stably transformed RKO-h-catenin cells (36).
Lithium chloride stabilizes B-catenin and inhibits TNFAmediated NF-KB activation. As another approach to support our
hypothesis, we used lithium chloride (LiCl), a well-known inhibitor
of glycogen synthase kinase 3h (GSK-3h), to block h-catenin
phosphorylation and degradation. LiCl was added to the carcinoid
cell line NCI H727 and dramatically induced h-catenin expression
(Supplementary Fig. S2A). LiCl also decreased TNFa-induced gel
shift for NF-nB (Supplementary Fig. S2B, lane 4). Finally, LiCl also
inhibited TNFa-stimulated p65 staining in cultures of a freshly
isolated carcinoid metastasis to the liver from a pancreatic
carcinoid primary tumor (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
B-Catenin inversely correlated with iNOS or Fas expression
in human liver tumors. Both iNOS and Fas are target genes of the
NF-nB pathway, which are also regulated by h-catenin signaling in
cancer cells. To determine if there was also an inverse correlation
between h-catenin and iNOS or Fas expression in vivo, we stained
25 samples of hepatocellular carcinoma or metastatic colorectal
cancer to liver by immunohistochemistry. We observed that hcatenin inversely correlated with iNOS or Fas expression in these
tumor tissue samples (Fig. 6C; Supplementary Table S1). Cases #1
and #2 are primary hepatocellular carcinoma tumor samples with
opposite findings: In case #1, h-catenin levels are low and the
tumor shows strong staining for both iNOS and Fas, whereas in
case #2, high h-catenin levels inversely result in low iNOS and Fas
expression (Fig. 6C). In 10 hepatocellular carcinoma tumors that
were resected, all of the h-catenin–positive tumors were negative
for iNOS or Fas staining, whereas the h-catenin–negative tumors
stained for both Fas and iNOS (Supplementary Table S1). For the
resected hepatic colorectal cancer metastases, 9 of 11 Fas-negative
tumors were h-catenin positive whereas all of the Fas-positive

tumors were negative for h-catenin staining. Similar findings were
observed for iNOS staining.

Discussion
Previously we identified that the hiNOS (NOS2) gene was
regulated by Wnt/h-catenin signaling and identified two TBEs in
the hiNOS promoter that accounted for a direct induction of basal
and cytokine-induced hiNOS promoter activity dependent on intact
TBE (30). However, in the course of those studies, we observed
several different human liver and colon cancer cells that actually
exhibited decreased iNOS gene expression after cytokine stimulation, which markedly contrasted with primary human and rodent
hepatocytes, as well as the findings in several other human cancer
cell lines. Because the level of activated h-catenin varies among
different cancers (1, 2) and because NF-nB has been shown to
have an important role in cytokine-mediated hiNOS transcription
(24–26) as well as inflammation-associated cancer (37, 38), we
hypothesized that an inverse effect might exist between h-catenin
signaling and NF-nB–dependent hiNOS gene transcription. This
study presents major and novel findings: (a) h-catenin signaling in
tumor cell lines inversely correlated with NF-nB–dependent hiNOS
gene expression; (b) overexpression of h-catenin inhibited
cytokine-induced hiNOS transcription to below basal levels
mediated by h-catenin interaction with NF-nB p50 and p65
proteins; (c) high levels of endogenous h-catenin in tumor cells
repressed TNFa-induced NF-nB activation that was reversed by
APC overexpression or enhanced by GSK-3h inhibition with LiCl;
(d) the inverse relationship of h-catenin and NF-nB–dependent
gene expression was not confined to hiNOS and was also seen with
other NF-nB–dependent genes such as Traf1 and Fas and; (e) the
inverse correlation of h-catenin levels and NF-nB activation was
also seen in vivo in primary hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal
cancer metastases, and neuroendocrine cancer.

NF-nB plays a key role in inflammation and carcinogenesis (28,
29). NF-nB is also a central transcription factor mediating TNFaand IL-1h–induced iNOS gene expression in rat and human
hepatocytes (25, 26, 33, 39, 40). Studies indicate that higher levels of
iNOS and NO contribute to apoptosis through cytotoxicity (41),
whereas lower NO levels may be involved in carcinogenesis (42).
NF-nB activation is up-regulated by inflammatory cytokines and

Although our previous work showed that the hiNOS gene was

b-Catenin Inhibits NF-kB–Mediated hiNOS Expression in Cancer

Figure 5. High-level h-catenin decreased TNF-induced NF-nB target gene
expression. HAh18 and HAh85 cells (A ) as well as RKO and HCT116 cells (B )
were treated with TNFa (10 ng/mL) for 3 h. Traf1 or iNOS protein expression
was analyzed by immunoblot. C, RKO cells with or without h-catenin stable
expression were treated with TNFa (10 ng/mL) for 3 h, and Traf1 protein
expression was analyzed. D, SW480-APC and SW480-vector cells were treated
with TNFa (10 ng/mL) for 3 h, and Traf1 expression was analyzed.

findings in the current study showed that h-catenin expression
indeed reduced cytokine-induced and p65-driven hiNOS-specific
NF-nB reporter activity (Fig. 2). Moreover, h-catenin overexpression
abolished cytokine-induced hiNOS promoter activity in the
HCT116, DLD1, and HepG2 cells. Hence, high levels of h-catenin
antagonized cytokine-mediated induction of the NF-nB–dependent
hiNOS gene.
By using a pair of cell lines derived from the HCT116 human
colon cancer cells, we found that stabilization of h-catenin by
mutation in the HAh18 cells (CTNNB1 /D45) decreased TNFainduced p50 nuclear translocation, NF-nB p50 DNA binding, and
hiNOS-specific NF-nB reporter activity (Fig. 3B–D). In contrast, the
absence of h-catenin signaling in the HAh85 cells produced the
opposite results (Fig. 3B–D) and augmented NF-nB–dependent
hiNOS and Traf1 protein expression (Fig. 5A). Through these
experiments, we can conclude that stabilized expression of hcatenin attenuates hiNOS expression by inhibiting NF-nB pathway
signaling.
In addition to testing mutant h-catenin cell lines, we also used
SW480 colon cancer cells stably expressing WT APC (SW480-APC)
to restore the truncated APC in the endogenous SW480 cells. The
SW480-APC cells exhibited decreased h-catenin protein by Western

blot and immunoflourescent staining (Fig. 4A and B) and enhanced
basal and TNFa-induced hiNOS expression and NF-nB DNA
binding activity (Fig. 4A–D). These results also support our finding
of an inverse correlation between h-catenin and TNFa-induced
NF-nB–dependent gene expression. These results also highlight
that mutations in either h-catenin or APC (leading to altered
cytosolic h-catenin levels) can modulate NF-nB–dependent target
gene expression.
Two other recent studies have shown a relationship between
h-catenin and NF-nB signaling (31, 37). Deng and colleagues (31)
first showed that h-catenin inhibited NF-nB activity in human
colon and breast cancer cell lines; however, they did not examine
for h-catenin or NF-nB–dependent gene expression in primary liver
cancer specimens. Subsequently, Sun and colleagues (37) reported
a cross talk between NF-nB and h-catenin in bacterial-colonized
HCT116 intestinal epithelial cells. In this study, constitutively
expressed h-catenin indirectly stabilized InBa and thereby
inhibited NF-nB. In our study, we did not find a major change in
InBa levels among cancer cell lines with different degrees of
h-catenin expression (Supplementary Fig. S1). Instead, we provided
evidence by coimmunoprecipitation for a direct interaction
between h-catenin and both p50 and p65 proteins. Neither of
these studies determined the effect of h-catenin on hiNOS gene
expression. Further, we developed stably transformed SW480
cells overexpressing APC and showed that this resulted in lower
h-catenin protein levels, lower h-catenin transcriptional activity,
and higher NF-nB DNA binding activity, and subsequently
increased hiNOS mRNA and protein expressions in colon cancer
cells. This is very important because it shows that manipulation of
Wnt signaling by either APC or h-catenin can influence NF-nB–
mediated target gene expression. Taken together, the inverse
correlation between h-catenin and hiNOS expression indicates that
activated h-catenin predominantly controls TNFa-induced hiNOS
expression and NO production via interaction between h-catenin
and NF-nB in cancer cells.
In contrast, Bandino and colleagues (44) recently reported that
EGTA/LiCl inactivation of GSK-3h increased h-catenin and
resulted in NF-nB–dependent activation of iNOS in rat hepatocytes.
Their experimental design examined cell adherens junction
disruption by collagenase liver perfusion and did not address the
role of h-catenin signaling in cytokine-stimulated iNOS expression
or the direct effects of h-catenin on NF-nB–dependent gene
activation in tumor cells.
To strengthen the significance of the findings in the cancer cells
in vitro, we also investigated the relationship between h-catenin
levels and NF-nB–dependent hiNOS and Fas expression in vivo in
resected hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic colorectal
cancer liver tumors. We observed that h-catenin inversely
correlated with iNOS or Fas expression in these tumors (Fig. 6C;
Supplementary Table S1). The in vivo tumor findings suggest that
the cross talk between Wnt/h-catenin and NF-nB signaling occurs
in the setting of inflammation-associated liver cancer and has also
been reported in breast cancer specimens (45). We acknowledge
that this study does not provide correlation between the level of
h-catenin/iNOS expression and the aggressiveness of the cancer
and overall patient prognosis. Such a study would require longterm follow-up in a larger group of patients.
Our results add insight to the complexity of the Wnt/h-catenin
and NF-nB/iNOS/NO signaling pathways involved in carcinogenesis (38, 46–48). Kinzler and Vogelstein (48) defined the important
role of Wnt/h-catenin in colon cancer, and Pikarsky and colleagues

Figure 6. Effect of h-catenin on NO-induced apoptosis
and iNOS/Fas expression in human hepatocellular
carcinoma tissues. A, HAh18 and HAh85 cells were
treated with NO donor S-nitroso-N -acetylpenicillamine
(SNAP ; 0 or 500 Amol/L) for 14 h, and lysates were
analyzed for cleaved caspase-3 protein expression.
B, HAh18 and HAh85 cells were treated with NO donor
S-nitroso-N -acetylpenicillamine (500 Amol/L) for 18 h as
indicated and labeled with cleaved PARP (green ). Actin
filaments have been labeled with phalloidin (red). DRAQ5
(blue ) fluorescent DNA dye is used as nuclear stain
(Leica TSL-SL confocal microscope 63; zoom, 200).
C, representative human primary hepatocellular carcinoma
tissue samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.
In case 1, when h-catenin was inactive (predominantly in
the membrane; a ), iNOS (b ) and Fas (c ) were strongly
expressed; in case 2, when h-catenin was active (in the
cytoplasm and nucleus; d), iNOS (e) and Fas (f )
expression levels were much lower.

(38) pointed out that NF-nB functions as a tumor promoter in
inflammation-associated cancer. Hofseth and colleagues (11) highlighted the interaction between NO and p53 as a crucial pathway in
inflammatory-mediated carcinogenesis, and also reported that
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a target of Wnt/h-catenin signaling
(49). Another study showed that matrix metalloproteinases mediate
NO-induced dissociation of h-catenin from membrane-bound
E-cadherin and the formation of nuclear h-catenin/LEF-1 complex
in mouse colonic epithelial cells (50). Our data show that Wnt/hcatenin signaling in cancer cells can diminish the overproduction
of cytokine-induced iNOS, which contributes to apoptosis by
NO-mediated cytotoxic mechanisms (41), and is consistent with a
study wherein h-catenin overexpression blocked NO-induced
