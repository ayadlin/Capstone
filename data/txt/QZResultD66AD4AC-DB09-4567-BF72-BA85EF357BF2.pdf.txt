ABSTRACT
Background: Given the modest responses to everolimus, a mTOR inhibitor, in
multiple tumor types, there is a pressing need to identify predictive biomarkers
for this drug. Using targeted ultra-deep sequencing, we aimed to explore genomic
alterations that confer extreme sensitivity to everolimus.
Results: We collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor/normal pairs from
39 patients (22 with exceptional clinical benefit, 17 with no clinical benefit) who were
treated with everolimus across various tumor types (13 gastric cancers, 15 renal
cell carcinomas, 2 thyroid cancers, 2 head and neck cancer, and 7 sarcomas). Ion
AmpliSeqTM Comprehensive Cancer Panel was used to identify alterations across all
exons of 409 target genes. Tumors were sequenced to a median coverage of 552x.
Cancer genomes are characterized by 219 somatic single-nucleotide variants (181
missense, 9 nonsense, 7 splice-site) and 22 frameshift insertions/deletions, with
a median of 2.1 mutations per Mb (0 to 12.4 mutations per Mb). Overall, genomic
alterations with activating effect on mTOR signaling were identified in 10 of 22 (45%)
patients with clinical benefit and these include MTOR, TSC1, TSC2, NF1, PIK3CA and
PIK3CG mutations. Recurrently mutated genes in chromatin remodeling genes (BAP1;
n = 2, 12%) and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (FGFR4; n = 2, 12%) were noted
only in patients without clinical benefit.
Conclusions: Regardless of different cancer types, mTOR-pathway-activating
mutations confer sensitivity to everolimus. Targeted sequencing of mTOR pathway
genes facilitates identification of potential candidates for mTOR inhibitors.

BACKGROUND

RESULTS

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key
component of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)
pathway that plays an important role of cell growth and
proliferation, metabolism, and angiogenesis [1]. Since
inhibition of mTOR signaling can abrogate the cellular
response to growth factor receptor activation, targeting
mTOR activation is an attractive approach for cancer
therapy.
Everolimus is a rapamycin analog that is being
developed as an inhibitor of mTORC1. Like rapamycin,
everolimus binds the cyclophilin FKBP-12, and this
complex binds the serine-threonine kinase of mTORC1
and inhibits signaling downstream. Everolimus has
been extensively tested for several kinds of tumor types,
and showed some significant and durable responses. In
renal cell carcinoma, everolimus provided a significant
benefit to patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
after failure of treatment with sorafenib or sunitinib [2].
Adding everolimus to exemestane significantly improved
median progression-free survival (PFS) compared with
exemestane alone in the treatment of estrogen receptorpositive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer patients
[3]. In addition, everolimus provided a significant
reduction in volume and seizure frequency in patients
with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma associated with
tuberous sclerosis, and prolonged survival in pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumor [4, 5].
However, there has not been a validated biomarker
for predicting response to everolimus, yet. Previous
studies used candidate gene approach for searching
mutations and revealed that PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
had an important role in everolimus sensitivity [6-8].
Recently, whole genome sequencing identified a somatic
mutation for everolimus sensitivity in bladder cancer [9].
In this study, mutation of tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1)
was suggested as a biomarker for everolimus response in
bladder cancer. Similarly, one anaplastic thyroid cancer
patient who showed sensitivity to everolimus, revealed a
nonsense mutation in TSC2, a negative regulator of mTOR
[10]. A recent study by Yoon et al. reported that pS6Ser240/4
expression may be a predictive biomarker for everolimus
sensitivity in gastric cancer patients [11]. Likewise, we
recently discovered one patient who showed exceptional
response to everolimus.
We hypothesized that there are driver genetic events,
which are clinically actionable and targetable, that occur
commonly across different tumor types. In this study,
we aim to perform next-generation sequencing (NGS) in
patients with different tumor types to explore common
genetic aberrations that confer sensitivity to everolimus.
We recruited patients who were treated with single-agent
everolimus, and sought to find universal biomarkers
regardless of tumor types and histologic subtypes.

Everolimus leading to response in a patient with
primary ductal adenocarcinoma of the lacrimal
gland
Our index patient was a 51-year-old male who
diagnosed with primary ductal adenocarcinoma of
the lacrimal gland in the left. (Figure 1). The patient
received multiple lines of chemotherapy, but patient
showed aggravation of primary tumor and progression to
bone metastasis. His tumor tissue was sent for targeted
next-generation sequencing at Foundation Medicine
profiling of 236 cancer-related genes and 47 introns of
19 genes involved in rearrangement. The assay reported
TP53 (Q38fs) mutation and NF1 (D1644A) mutation
(Supplementary Figure S2A-B). While there were no
approved therapies or clinical trials to address for TP53
mutation and NF1 mutation at that time, a therapeutic
attempt using everolimus 10mg once per day was
initiated in October 2013 on the basis of data published
by McGillicuddy et al, supporting the sensitivity of
everolimus in loss-of-function mutation in the NF1
tumor suppressor gene [12]. The patient was seen again
1 month after, and we noticed decreased exophthalmus
and reduced skin thickening around his left eyelid. In
terms of subjective symptoms, he reported improved pain
of his bone metastasis lesions in right humerus head and
left shoulder. The PET-CT taken after 1 month showed
a partial response as per PET response criteria [13],
showing more than 25% reduction of SUVmax compared
to baseline. He was maintained on everolimus and the CT
scan taken after 2 months of therapy showed shrinkage
of the measurable tumor lesions (26.5mm to 17.6mm,
33.5% reduction). His tumor showed further decrease
in SUVmax in the PET-CT scan taken after 4 months of
therapy (Supplementary Figure 3). The partial response
was maintained for 8 months.

Patients’ characteristics
We collected a total of thirty-nine patients with five
different tumor types (13 with gastric cancer, 15 with renal
cell carcinoma, 2 with thyroid cancer, 2 with head and
neck cancer, and 7 with sarcoma) were analyzed by NGS.
As shown in Table 1, the median age of all patients was 57,
and there were 24 (61.5%) males and 15 (38.5%) females.
There were 22 (56.4%) patients with clinical benefit and
17 (43.6%) patients without clinical benefit. Patients with
clinical benefit included 9 patients with partial response
(PR) and 13 patients with durable stable disease (SD),
with 10 patients showing SD ≥ 6 months. All patients
without clinical benefit showed progressive disease (PD)
as their best response with no tumor shrinkage at all. The
10548

Recurrently mutated genes such as PBRM1, MTOR, NF1,
VHL, PD34DIP, and ARID1A were found in patients with
clinical benefit, in the order of frequency. In contrast,
recurrently mutated genes such as VHL, TP53, and
ARID1A were found in patients with non-clinical benefit.
(Supplementary Figure S4). Sanger sequencing for mTOR
pathway genes (MTOR/TSC1/TSC2/PIK3CA/NF1/NF2/

median progression-free survival was 13.0 months (95%
CI, 6.3-19.7) for patients with clinical benefit and 1.7
months (95% CI, 1.54-1.85) for patients without clinical
benefit. As of data cutoff, two patients were still under
ongoing everolimus treatment (Supplementary Table 3, 4).

Overall genetic alterations
To identify possible genetic mechanisms of
sensitivity to everolimus, we performed targeted
sequencing of the pre-treatment tumor and paired germline
DNA. Tumors were sequenced to a median coverage of
552x. Cancer genomes were characterized by 219 somatic
single-nucleotide variants (181 missense, 9 nonsense, 7
splice-site) and 22 frameshift insertions/deletions, with a
median of 2.1 mutations per Mb (0 to 12.4 mutations per
Mb). Of these alterations, 13 mutations were previously
reported in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer.
Mutations were further analyzed for functional prediction
of amino acid changes using two different prediction
algorithms (Provean and SIFT) (Supplementary Table
5). TP53 gene alterations were the most common among
all genes and were found in 8 of 38 tumors (21.1%).

Pathways relevant to everolimus sensitivity
We examined the sequencing data for biologically
plausible mechanisms of sensitivity to everolimus, and
identified multiple mutations in the mTOR-pathway
(Figure 2).
Two PIK3CA mutations were detected in patients
with clinical benefit. A mutation in the helical domain of
PIK3CA (p.E542K), which is known to be constitutively
activating and selectively sensitive to everolimus [14],
was found in a renal cell carcinoma patient with the PFS
of 23.9 months. In addition, a kinase domain mutation

Table 1: Baseline characteristics of all patients (n=39)

of PIK3CA (p.H1047R) was found in a head and neck
cancer patient with partial response. Alterations in
TSC1 gene were noted in three patients: a patient with
anaplastic thyroid cancer who harbored a nonsense
mutation in TSC1 (p.Trp103*) and a renal cell carcinoma
patient with a TSC1 splicing variant (c.1029+1G>A). In
addition, a malignant histiosarcoma patient had TSC1
missense mutation (p.A307V) and showed significant
tumor reduction (-24.3%). One TSC2 missense mutation
(p.E588K) was found in a gastric cancer patient. Three
MTOR missense mutations (N1421D, K1771R, I1973F)
were found in patients with gastric cancer, angiosarcoma
and renal cell carcinoma, respectively. All three mutations
were located in FAT (FRAP, ATM, TRAP) domain of
MTOR.
Overall, genomic alterations which may activate
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mTOR signaling were identified in 10 of 22 (45%)
patients with clinical benefit (Figure 3A). In particular,
TSC1/TSC2/MTOR mutations were key components
in determining everolimus sensitivity (Figure 3B). The
incidence of these mutations were 31.8% (7/22) in patients
with clinical benefit as compared with 0% in those with
non-clinical benefit (P=0.012). The prevalence of these
recurrently mutated genes and their correlation with
clinical benefit strongly suggest that they confer sensitivity
to everolimus.
While TSC1/TSC2/MTOR alterations were
exclusively found in patients with clinical benefit, we
also searched for recurrently mutated genes that were
exclusively identified in patients with non-clinical benefit.
Mutations in chromatin remodeling gene (BAP1; n=2,
12%) and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (FGFR4;

important for mTOR function and both Provean and SIFT
predicted that our mutation was deleterious mutation. In
addition, K1771R mutation is located in TRD3 which is
interact with the C lobe on one side of the kinase domain.
Mutation of I1973 amino acid was previously reported to
be hyperactivating mutation which involved in restricting
active site access and both Provean and SIFT reported that
I1973F is deleterious mutation [17].
TSC1 and TSC2 are upstream key negative
regulators of mTORC1. They form a heterotrimer, a
GTPase-activating protein for Rheb (Ras homologue
enriched in brain), a GTP-binding protein that activates
mTORC1 by binding to it. As the loss of TSC1-TSC2
function activates mTORC1 pathway, strong scientific
rationale exists for the use of mTOR inhibitors in this
setting. Sirolimus has shown promising effects in patients
with inactivating mutations in TSC1, TSC2 and STK11 in
hamartoma syndromes such as tuberous sclerosis complex
and Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome [18-20]. Moreover, 2 out of
3 patients with malignant perivascular epithelioid cell
tumors who had clinical response to sirolimus showed

n=2, 12%) were noted, but not statistically significant.

DISCUSSION
Here, we described multiple activating mutations in
the mTOR pathway found in patient tumors that showed
exquisite sensitivity to everolimus. TSC1/TSC2/MTOR
alterations were exclusively found in patients who showed
extended clinical benefit, which suggest that they confer
sensitivity to everolimus. NF1 mutation together with
TP53 mutation presents an aggressive tumor behavior, but
tumor growth is effectively inhibited by everolimus.
In theory, dependency on the mTOR pathway
may render enhanced sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors.
Three different mutations (N1421D, K1771R, I1973F)
in the FAT domain of MTOR have not been previously
reported in the publicly available genomic database [15].
Previously, it has been proposed that FAT domain consist
of TRD1, TRD2 and TRD3 domain and interacts to yield
a configuration that exposes the catalytic domain [16, 17].
Especially, N1421D was located in TRD1 domain which is

TSC1/2 loss [21]. There was a recent report of renal cell
carcinoma patients with extended benefit from mTOR
inhibitor showed that TSC1 and TSC2 offer explanation
for treatment response [22]. Similarly, we identified 1
TSC1 splicing variant (renal cell carcinoma), 1 TSC1
nonsense mutation (anaplastic thyroid cancer), 1 TSC1
missense mutation (sarcoma) and 1 TSC2 missense
mutation (angiosarcoma). Given that heterozygous loss
of TSC1 is common in renal cell carcinoma (>30%) [23],
TSC1 and TSC2 may be screened as predictive biomarkers
of everolimus in renal cell carcinoma patients who
progressed on VEGF-targeted therapy.
Loss-of-function mutations in the NF1 tumor
suppressor gene affects mTOR pathway, leading to
constitutive activation of mTOR. This activation depends
on Ras and PI3 kinase, and is mediated by the inactivation
of the TSC2-encoded protein tuberin by AKT [24]. In this
way, NF1-deficient tumors alone may show exquisite
sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors. In conjunction with our
index patient with TP53 and NF1 mutation, it has been
reported that NF1 heterozygosity cooperates with TP53
mutation to promote tumorigenesis. Homozygous null
NF1 mutations may occur, which mediate sensitivity
to mTOR inhibitors [12]. Although rare in tumors such
as gastric cancer, sarcoma, and renal cell carcinoma,
recent finding that NF1 mutations are enriched (11%) in
oncogene-negative subset of lung adenocarcinomas, and

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

our finding suggests novel therapeutic opportunities for
the subset of patients with NF1 mutations.
Conceptually, activating mutations within
the phosphoinositide 3-kinase, catalytic subunit α
(PI3K-p110 α) encoded by the PIK3CA gene, lead to
mTOR pathway activation [6, 25]. In this study, activating
PIK3CA mutations in helical domain (p.E542K), and
kinase domain (p.H1047R) were found in a renal cell
carcinoma and a parotid gland choriocarcinoma patient,
respectively. However, one patient with a PIK3CA
mutation (p.H1047R) showed non-clinical benefit to
everolimus, showing rapid increase of ascites within 1
month of everolimus treatment. That activating PIK3CA
mutation does not always lead to response was previously
reported by Janku et al. where they described patients with
H1047R PIK3CA mutation experienced a response rate of
44% [26].
Our study has a few limitations. Although
prespecified, the selected patients with clinical benefit in
this study may only explain a portion of mechanisms of
sensitivity. Other genetic or epigenetic alterations that are
not covered in the CCP may be missed out even if they
regulate sensitivity or resistance to everolimus. Because
study was retrospective in nature, and the number of
patients analyzed was relatively small, these data must be
interpreted cautiously
However, to the best of our knowledge, this is

the first report that identified histology-independent
mechanisms of sensitivity to mTOR inhibitor in multiple
tumor types. Regardless of histology, mTOR pathwayactivating mutations confer exceptional response to
everolimus, and this provides the rationale for the
development of so-called basket trials. The current study
highlights the fact that mutational analyses of somatic
variants could allow sub-classification of patients for
optimal treatment, and provides a basis for a basket trial
in the future. These efforts will eventually increase the
likelihood of success of drug trials especially in patients
with rare cancer types.
In conclusion, the genomic information derived
from patients with exceptional clinical benefit may provide
a basis for everolimus sensitivity. Overall, it seems that
screening for TSC1/TSC2/MTOR mutations warrants
further investigation in application of mTOR inhibitors in
the clinic.

therapy (Supplementary Table 1). Patients with extended
clinical benefit and non-benefit were selected for this
study. The criteria for extended clinical benefit were:
1) complete response or 2) partial response for more
than 6 months or 3) durable stable disease with PFS on
everolimus ≥ 1.5 x PFS of prior treatment. The criteria for
non-benefit were 1) no shrinkage in tumor diameter and 2)
progressive disease as best response.
Clinical information including age, sex, treatment
duration, best response to treatment, percent change in
tumor size, previous treatment history and survival data
were collected. The study protocol was approved by each
center’s independent ethics committee or institutional
review board and was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. All
patients provided written informed consent for genomic
testing used for this study. Specimens were evaluated by
pathologists (H.K.K) to identify tumor-bearing areas for
DNA extraction.

Analysis of molecular aberrations

This study was supported by a grant of the Korean
Health Technology R&D Project, Ministry of Health &
Welfare, Republic of Korea. (HI12C1440).

Ion
AmpliSeq™  Comprehensive
Cancer
Panel  (CCP, Life Technologies) was used for cancer
specific target sequencing, targeting 409 genes with
~16,000 amplicons. Sequencing was processed by Ion
PGMTM system and sequencing data was analyzed by
PGMTM built in TSS (Torrent Suite Software) 4.0.2 version
(Supplementary Fig S1). Variants acquired from the CCP
panel were filtered by germline variants acquired from
our patients and 1000 genome data. Mutations with less
than 50x depth and less than 10% variant frequency were
filtered out [27]. Quality score, a parameter of variant
call format using phred scale, was used to filter out the
variants and Q30 was used for cut-off value [27]. Then,
variants were annotated using ANNOVAR [28] and noncoding region and synonymous variants were filtered out.
Remaining variants were assessed using the Integrative
Genomics Viewer (IGV) [29] and loci were further
analyzed for functional prediction of amino acid changes
using two different prediction algorithms (Provean
and SIFT) [30, 31]. Mutations in MTOR, TSC1, TSC2,
PIK3CA, NF1, NF2, PTEN, AKT1 were validated by
Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing. Sanger sequencing

Statistical analyses
Tumor response was evaluated using the RECIST
v1.1 [32] and progression-free survival (PFS) was
defined as the time from the start of everolimus to
disease progression or death from any cause. Statistical
significance of preferential association of somatic
variations with specific clusters was assessed with chisquare test or Fisher’s exact test. All statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL,
