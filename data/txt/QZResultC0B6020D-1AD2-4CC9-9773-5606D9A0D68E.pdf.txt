The forkhead box transcription factor FOXM1 is an essential effector of G2/M-phase transition, mitosis and the DNA damage
response. As such, it is frequently deregulated during tumorigenesis. Here we report that FOXM1 is dynamically modiﬁed by
SUMO1 but not by SUMO2/3 at multiple sites. We show that FOXM1 SUMOylation is enhanced in MCF-7 breast cancer cells in
response to treatment with epirubicin and mitotic inhibitors. Mutation of ﬁve consensus conjugation motifs yielded a SUMOylationdeﬁcient mutant FOXM1. Conversely, fusion of the E2 ligase Ubc9 to FOXM1 generated an auto-SUMOylating mutant (FOXM1Ubc9). Analysis of wild-type FOXM1 and mutants revealed that SUMOylation inhibits FOXM1 activity, promotes translocation to the
cytoplasm and enhances APC/Cdh1-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. Further, expression of the SUMOylation-deﬁcient
mutant enhanced cell proliferation compared with wild-type FOXM1, whereas the FOXM1-Ubc9 fusion protein resulted in persistent
cyclin B1 expression and slowed the time from mitotic entry to exit. In summary, our ﬁndings suggest that SUMOylation attenuates
FOXM1 activity and causes mitotic delay in cytotoxic drug response.

INTRODUCTION
Anthracyclines and taxanes are some of the most effective and
commonly used classes of anticancer drugs. However, resistance
to these agents is also common and signiﬁcantly restricts their
therapeutic efﬁcacy. The forkhead transcription factor FOXM1 has
a crucial role in mediating the DNA damage response and
resistance to genotoxic agents, including epirubicin, through
transcriptional control of a family of DNA double-strand breaksensing and homologous recombination repair genes, including
CHEK1 (CHK1), EXO1, RAD51 and BRIP1.1–3 Similarly, FOXM1 has
also been implicated in mediating the actions of taxanes, but the
underlying mechanisms are less clearly deﬁned.4 Nevertheless, the
efﬁcacy of these genotoxic and cytotoxic agents depends on their
ability to modulate the DNA damage response and/or the G2/M
cell cycle checkpoint.5,6
Transition through the cell cycle is tightly co-ordinated at
multiple levels, including at gene expression and in response to
post-translational modiﬁcations of key regulators. Deregulation
of the cell cycle underpins multiple diseases, including cancer,
where the loss of checkpoint control can lead to uncontrolled
proliferation, resistance to apoptosis and genomic instability.
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells, coordination
of the G2/M checkpoint is mediated through the forkhead
transcription family members Fkh2p7 and FOXM1,8 respectively.
Loss of FOXM1 is associated with defects in chromosome
segregation and cytokinesis,8 and is homozygous lethal in
mouse models.9 We have shown previously that genotoxic
agents such as epirubicin induce FOXM1 transcription.10 FOXM1

is further regulated at the post-translational level in response to
epirubicin,10,11 although this level of regulation remains poorly
understood.
SUMOylation is a post-translational modiﬁcation critical for DNA
damage response,12,13 mitosis and cell cycle progression.14 It is
also required for the regulation of mitotic spindle asymmetry in S.
cerevisiae.15 SUMOylation has an established role in the mitosis of
mammalian cells, in part by regulating the association of CENP-E
to the kinetochores16 and by mobilising topoisomerase II from the
mitotic chromatin.17 Deconjugation of SUMO is also essential for
cell cycle progression and mitosis in both yeast and mammals,
and SUMO-speciﬁc proteases (SENPs) display cell cycle-phasespeciﬁc expression patterns.18,19
On the basis of these observations, we speculated that
SUMOylation could have a key role in regulating FOXM1 activity
in the response to anticancer drugs. We show that treatment of
MCF-7 breast cancer cells with epirubicin, paclitaxel or spindle
poison nocodazole enhances SUMOylation of FOXM1. We further
report that this dynamic modiﬁcation governs the transcriptional
activity, cellular localization and turnover of FOXM1.
RESULTS
FOXM1 can be modiﬁed by SUMO1
SUMOylation has a critical role in the DNA damage response and
G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. We postulated that FOXM1 is modiﬁed
by SUMO in response to cytotoxic drug treatment. To test this
idea, we ﬁrst investigated whether FOXM1 is subjected to

His-tagged SUMO1, and puriﬁed the His-tagged proteins under
denaturing conditions (Figure 1c). Although SUMO1 does not
commonly form poly-SUMO chains, multiple SUMO-conjugated
forms of FOXM1 were detected, suggesting the presence of
several acceptor sites in FOXM1 (Figure 1c). An in vitro SUMOylation assay conﬁrmed multi-SUMOylation of recombinant isopropyl
b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible FOXM1 in an ATPdependent manner (Figure 1d). To increase speciﬁcally the
proportion of modiﬁed FOXM1, we made use of the Ubc9
fusion-directed SUMOylation system.20 To this end, we fused
FOXM1 to mouse Ubc9 via a ﬁve amino-acid linker sequence. This

SUMOylated in vivo and in vitro. Expression of the SUMO E2 ligase
Ubc9 in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells resulted in the appearance
of higher molecular weight FOXM1 species on western blot
analysis, suggestive of SUMO conjugation (Figure 1a). In addition,
coexpression of Ubc9 and SUMO1, but not of SUMO2 or -3,
resulted in the detection of multiple SUMOylated FOXM1 species,
indicating that free SUMO1 is a limiting factor in the level of
modiﬁcation of this transcription factor (Figure 1b). However, this
result does not preclude the involvement of SUMO2 or -3 in
FOXM1 SUMOylated. To conﬁrm covalent linkage of FOXM1 to
SUMO1, we coexpressed FOXM1 in the presence or absence of a

Figure 1. FOXM1 is SUMOylated by SUMO1. (a) Protein lysates were prepared from MCF-7 cells with or without transfection of the SUMO E2ligase Ubc-9. FOXM1 was detected by western blot analysis and a higher molecular weight form was observed consistent with SUMOylation of
FOXM1. (b) MCF-7 cells were transfected with FOXM1, Ubc9 or SUMO1, -2 or -3, and FOXM1 was detected by western blot analysis. Multiple
higher molecular weight forms of FOXM1 were observed, consistent with poly-SUMOylation. (c) MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with HisSUMO1, FOXM1 and Ubc9. SUMOylated proteins were purified using Ni2 þ -column affinity pulldown under denaturing conditions (8 M urea).
Input and His-tagged proteins were probed for FOXM1, and poly-SUMOylated FOXM1 was detectable demonstrating the covalent linkage of
His-SUMO1 to FOXM1. (d) IPTG-inducible recombinant His-tagged FOXM1 was expressed in E. coli and isolated using Ni2 þ -column affinity
pulldown. Cell lysates from induced and non-induced E. coli were incubated with Ubc9 and SUMO1 in the presence and absence of Mg2 þ -ATP
and reaction buffer, and resolved using SDS-PAGE. SUMO1 was detected by western blot analysis. (e) MCF-7 cells were transfected with
constructs encoding FOXM1 fused to mouse Ubc9 (FOXM1-Ubc9) with or without eGFP-tagged SUMO1. The higher molecular weight band
detected by FOXM1 and Ubc9 antibodies, which is consistent with the auto-SUMOylation of FOXM1-Ubc9, is indicated. SUMOylation was
enhanced and increased in molecular weight by co-transfection of eGFP-SUMO1 (indicated by the multiple arrows). (f ) MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with FOXM1, SUMO1, Ubc9, SENP-1 and the dominant-negative SENP-1 construct (SENP1-C630S), and lyssates were analysed by
western blot analysis.

Epirubicin enhances FOXM1 SUMOylation
We next tested whether SUMOylation of FOXM1 is altered upon
epirubicin treatment. Co-immunoprecipitation studies in MCF-7
cells showed that FOXM1 and SUMO1 form higher order
complexes, afﬁrming that FOXM1 is covalently modiﬁed. FOXM1
levels, but not the higher order FOXM1–SUMO1 complexes,
decreased following epirubicin treatment, suggesting SUMO1 was
limiting in MCF-7 cells and increased SUMOylation upon
epirubicin treatment (Figure 2a and Supplementary Figures S1
and S2). Interestingly, FOXM1–SUMO1 conjugation occurred at

FOXM1-Ubc9 fusion protein was subjected to auto-SUMOylation,
which was enhanced upon co-transfection of enhanced green
ﬂuorescent protein (eGFP)-tagged SUMO1 (Figure 1e). SUMOylation of FOXM1 was reversed upon coexpression of the SUMO
deconjugase SENP-1 (Figure 1f). Moreover, coexpression of a
dominant-negative SENP-1(C630S) mutant signiﬁcantly enhanced
FOXM1 SUMOylation, suggesting that modiﬁed FOXM1 is a
substrate for endogenous SENP-1 (Figure 1f). These data support
the conclusion that FOXM1 is dynamically modiﬁed by SUMO1
in vivo.

Figure 2. FOXM1 is SUMOylated in response to epirubicin treatment. (a) MCF-7 cells were treated with epirubicin (1 mM) for 0, 6 and 24 h. Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) was performed with a FOXM1 antibody and was probed for SUMO1 and vice versa; inputs (1/10 of IP) and IP
products with IgG and specific antibodies were resolved on western blot analysis and were probed for FOXM1 and SUMO1. High molecular
weights of FOXM1- and SUMO1-containing species are highlighted ‘*’. (b) MCF-7 cells co-transfected with 0.05 mg of eGFP-FOXM1 and 0.025 mg
per well of either tRFP-SUMO1 (FRET acceptor) or empty expression plasmids were treated with 0.1 mM epirubicin for 0, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h.
Intensity-merged fluorescence lifetime images of doxorubicin treatment time course are shown. The reduction in donor fluorescence lifetime
indicates the occurrence of FRET, implying that eGFP-FOXM1 and tRFP-SUMO1 are within 10 nm of each other. (c) Analysis of fluorescence
lifetime data, showing mean lifetimes ±s.e.m. of eGFP-FOXM1 fluorescence,was determined by fitting the fluorescence decay as described.
Each measurement is based on 4100 cells. The results show that eGFP-FOXM1 and tRFP-SUMO1 interactions significantly increase after 6 or
8 h epirubicin treatment (Tukey’s HSD test: http://www.amazon.co.uk/Biostatistics-Methodology-Sciences-Probability-Statistics/dp/

FOXM1 is modiﬁed at multiple sites
We next used in silico prediction algorithms (SUMOplot and
SUMOsp) to identify potential SUMOylation sites in FOXM1
(Figure 4a). Consensus cKXE motifs were identiﬁed throughout
FOXM1 and clustered near the transactivation domain (Figure 4a).
They were absent from the N-terminal repressor domain. Using
site-directed mutagenesis, we generated a series of FOXM1
mutants in which individual lysines within consensus motifs were
mutated to arginine (Figure 4b). With the exception of K201R, no
single mutation changed the SUMOylation pattern of FOXM1.
Conjugation at K201 was conﬁrmed by immunoprecipitation with
SUMO1 and immunoprobing of FOXM1 (Supplementary Figure S6;
loss of SUMO-FOXM1 band highlighted). The data suggested a
degree of redundancy between putative acceptor sites in FOXM1.
Consequently, we simultaneously mutated multiple sites within
FOXM1 to produce a SUMO-deﬁcient mutant. Mutation of seven
lysine residues (7X(K4R)-FOXM1) completely abolished SUMOylation of FOXM1 in cells overexpressing Ubc9 and SUMO1
(Figure 4c). To test for site redundancy, we then reversed
individual arginine residues in FOXM17X(K4R) back to lysine
and identiﬁed K440 and K356 as being redundant for FOXM1
SUMOylation (Figure 4d). Indeed, the FOXM15X(K4R) mutant,

FOXM1 is SUMOylated in response to mitotic checkpoint drugs
As FOXM1 is also critical for the G2/M-phase progression,8,21 we
examined whether mitotic disruptors would also enhance FOXM1
SUMOylation. To this end, MCF-7 cells were treated with
nocodazole, a spindle poison, or paclitaxel. Both compounds
have previously been shown to induce a G2/M-phase delay in

MCF-7 cells.8,22 Consistent with our previous result, only low levels
of SUMOylated FOXM1 were detected in untreated asynchronous
cells (Figure 3a). However, this was signiﬁcantly increased
following treatment with nocodazole (Figure 3a), suggesting a
role for SUMOylation of FOXM1 in mitotic progression. Following
coexpression of FOXM1 with SUMO1, we also observed increased
SUMO conjugation in response to paclitaxel treatment (Figure 3b),
a response that was noticeably more pronounced than that
observed with nocodazole. These data demonstrate that cytostatic
drugs also enhance FOXM1 SUMOylation.

low and stable levels in the epirubicin-resistant MCF-7EpiR cells. In
agreement, endogenous FOXM1 increased its colocalization with
SUMO1 in MCF-7 but not in MCF-7EpiR cells in response to
epirubicin (Supplementary Figure S3). Moreover, epirubicin treatment of transfected MCF-7 cells increased the colocalization and
Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between eGFP-tagged
FOXM1 and red ﬂuorescent protein (tRFP)-tagged SUMO1 as
determined by confocal (Supplementary Figure S4) and ﬂuorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) (Figure 2b), respectively.
Analysis of the FRET donor eGFP-FOXM1 over a 24 h period
following epirubicin treatment demonstrated a signiﬁcant
decrease in ﬂuorescence lifetime at 6 and 8 h, indicating increased
interaction with tRFP-SUMO1 (Figure 2c). In contrast, there were
no signiﬁcant changes in ﬂuorescence lifetime when the donor
was expressed alone, conﬁrming that the measured change in
lifetime is due to FRET between eGFP-FOXM1 and SUMO1-tRFP in
response to epirubicin treatment. Consistently, SUMO1 expression
was induced by epirubicin in the MCF-7 but remained at low levels
in MCF-7EpiR cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). Taken all together,
these data revealed that SUMO1 expression and its interaction
with FOXM1 were inducible by epirubicin in the MCF-7 cells;
however, by comparison, these were occurring at relatively low
and constant levels in MCF-7EpiR cells. The kinetics of FOXM1/
SUMO1 expression and interaction also suggested the possibility
that FOXM1-SUMOylation is associated with its downregulation in
expression.

then co-transfected with WT- or indicated mutant-FOXM1, SUMO1 and Ubc9 constructs, and 24 h later protein lysates were prepared and
FOXM1 SUMOylation was determined by western blot analysis. (c) FOXM1 mutants were generated, containing multiple lysine-to-arginine
mutations, from FOXM11X(K4R) (K210R) to FOXM17X(K4R) (K201R/K218R/K356R/K440R/K460R/K478R/K495R). Mutational order was based
on site location. FOXM1 mutant SUMOylation was determined as above. (d) FOXM17X(K4R) was subjected to reversal of individual mutations
(R4K) to examine site redundancy. Mutants were assessed for SUMOylation as above and K356R and K440R were identified as redundant
mutations. (e) MCF-7 cells were transfected with WT-FOXM1 or FOXM15X(K4R) (K201R/K218R/K460R/K478R/K495R) with or without Ubc9 and
SUMO1. SUMOylation of FOXM1 was determined as above. (f ) MCF-7 cells were transfected with either FOXM1-Ubc9 or FOXM15X(K4R)-Ubc9
with or without eGFP-tagged SUMO1. Loss of the auto-SUMOylated form of FOXM1 was observed in FOXM15X(K4R)-Ubc9. SUMOylation of
FOXM1 was determined as above.

phosphorylation was detected using a phosphorylated-M-phase-associated protein-specific antibody (MPM-2). The membrane was then
reprobed with a FOXM1 antibody, demonstrating that the free FOXM1 displayed no MPM-2 detectable phosphorylation following
SUMOylation in the WT-FOXM1, whereas the SUMOylated form of FOXM1 was detectable by MPM-2. These are indicated by boxes.

Figure 6. SUMOylation of FOXM1 promotes its degradation and a SUMOylation mutant is resistant to Cdh1-mediated degradation. (a) MCF-7

carrying ﬁve point mutations (K201R, K218R, K460R, K478R and
K495R), was found to be SUMOylation-deﬁcient following Ubc9
and SUMO1 coexpression (Figure 4e). Further, when fused to
Ubc9, the FOXM15X(K4R) mutant displayed no auto-SUMOylation
activity (Figure 4f).
SUMOylated FOXM1 resides in the cytoplasm
During the cell cycle, FOXM1 becomes progressively phosphorylated through G1/S- and G2/M-phase progression in an ERK- and
Cdk1-dependent manner.8,23 This leads to nuclear localization of
FOXM1 and activation.8,23 We therefore sought to determine
whether SUMOylation has an impact on FOXM1 phosphorylation,
nuclear accumulation and/or activity. Coexpression of SUMO1 and
Ubc9 resulted in multi-SUMOylated FOXM1, which following
subcellular fractionation was found to reside in the cytoplasm
(Figure 5a). In agreement, the auto-SUMOylated FOXM1-Ubc9
fusion protein was also present in the cytoplasm, whereas the
SUMOylation-defective FOXM15X(K4R) mutant was not
(Figure 5b). Confocal microscopy further supported the notion
that SUMOylation promotes cytoplasmic translocation of FOXM1.
Cytoplasmic staining was present in the FOXM1-Ubc9-expressing
cells, whereas it was exclusively nuclear in cells transfected with
the FOXM15X(K4R)-Ubc9 mutant (Figure 5c; Supplementary
Figure S7A). SUMOylation-dependent cytoplasmic translocation
of FOXM1 was not dependent on modiﬁcation of a speciﬁc SUMOacceptor site (Supplementary Figure S7B), and was unaffected by
deletion of the N-terminal repressor domain (DN-FOXM;
Figure 5d). These observations suggest that binding of the
N-terminal repressor domain to the trans-activating domain is in
this instance not required for cytoplasmic localization of FOXM1
(Figure 5d).
We next determined whether there was an interdependency
between SUMOylation and phosphorylation of FOXM1. No
differences in basal phosphorylation were observed between the
FOXM15X(K4R) mutant and wild-type (WT) FOXM1 following
immunoprecipitation and immunodetection with MPM-2, an
M-phase-speciﬁc antiphospho-Ser/Thr-Pro antibody that recognises FOXM1 (Figure 5e). This suggested that SUMOylation does
not inﬂuence FOXM1 phosphorylation. However, coexpression of
Ubc9 and SUMO1 resulted in the formation of poly-SUMO1–
FOXM1 conjugates detectable with the MPM-2 antibody
(Figure 5e; highlighted in panel 1). In contrast, unconjugated
FOXM1 was not detectable following reprobing with MPM-2
(Figure 5e; highlighted in panel 2). Critically, upon reprobing,
similar levels of unconjugated FOXM1 were detected between the
control and SUMO1/Ubc9-expressing cells (Figure 5e), suggesting
that phosphorylation of FOXM1 is a cue for SUMO conjugation
and not vice versa. Although previous studies demonstrated that
the ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases have a role in
regulating the nuclear translocation and transacting activity of
FOXM1,23,24 inhibiting their activity or mutating their target sites
in FOXM1 did not have any appreciable effects on FOXM1
SUMOylation (Supplementary Figure S8), arguing that other
kinases are involved.
SUMOylation accelerates Cdh1-mediated degradation of FOXM1
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that SUMOylation is
associated with a decrease in its expression levels (Figure 2a and
Supplementary Figures S1, S2, S3, S4 and S5). We therefore
explored the role of SUMOylation in regulating FOXM1 stability.
Following cycloheximide treatment to inhibit protein translation,
we observed that SUMOylated forms of FOXM1 degraded more
quickly compared with unconjugated FOXM1 (Figure 6a). FOXM1
is a substrate for the APC/Cdh1 complex and is degraded during
entry into anaphase to allow for mitotic progression.25 To test
whether SUMOylation has an impact on FOXM1 degradation by
the APC/Cdh1 complex, we transfected MCF-7 with either the WT
& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited

or the SUMOylation-deﬁcient FOXM1 and with increasing levels of
an expression vector encoding Cdh1(4a), a constitutively activated
form of Cdh1.26 Elevation of Cdh1 levels resulted in the
appearance of a higher molecular weight form of FOXM1,
consistent with ubiquitination, which was absent in the cells
transfected with the SUMOylation-deﬁcient FOXM15X(K4R)
mutant (Figure 6b). This suggested that SUMO modiﬁcation may
earmark FOXM1 for Cdh1-mediated degradation. Consistent with
this notion, we found that coexpression of Cdh1(4a) signiﬁcantly
shortened the half-life of WT-FOXM1 but not the FOXM15X(K4R)
mutant following cycloheximide treatment. (Figure 6c). Consistently, overexpression of Cdh1(4a) decreased the half-life of the
endogenous FOXM1, whereas Cdh1 depletion increased its halflife (Supplementary Figures S9 and S10). Next, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments in cells coexpressing Cdh1(4a)
and either WT-FOXM1 or FOXM15X(K4R) mutant. Interestingly,
Cdh1(4a) bound more strongly to the SUMOylation-deﬁcient
mutant (Figure 6d), suggesting that this modiﬁcation is not
required for interaction of FOXM1 with the APC/Cdh1 complex but
has an impact on subsequent ubiquitination. To assess this
possibility, we coexpressed haemagglutinin-tagged ubiquitin with
either the WT-FOXM1 or FOXM1(5XK4R) and performed coimmunoprecipitation analysis (Figure 6e). Consistent with previous
observations, WT-FOXM1 showed higher levels of ubiquitination
compared with FOXM15X(K4R) (Figure 6e), supporting the idea
that unmodiﬁed FOXM1 is more resistant to APC/Cdh1-mediated
ubiquitination and degradation.
FOXM1 SUMOylation inhibits proliferation and delays mitotic
progression
As SUMOylation promoted cytoplasmic accumulation and degradation of FOXM1, we hypothesized that the SUMOylationdeﬁcient mutant would exert stronger transcriptional activity
and promote cell proliferation. In agreement, the transcriptional
activity of the FOXM15X(K4R)-Ubc9 was found to be consistently
higher than that of FOXM1-Ubc9 using a variety of
FOXM1-responsive promoter–reporter systems, including 6 
DNA-binding element, cyclin B1 and GADD45 luciferase reporter
assays (Figures 7a–c and Supplementary Figure S11). Moreover,
this activity was also dependent on the presence of forkhead
response elements, as demonstrated by the cyclin B1-mut3
reporter, which contains mutations in the forkhead response
element (Figure 7b). We next determined the effect of FOXM1
SUMOylation on cell proliferation using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
staining. Transfection of WT-FOXM1 did not signiﬁcantly alter cell
proliferation. However, transfection of SUMO1 with or without
FOXM1 markedly reduced cell proliferation (Figure 7d and
Supplementary Figure S12). Conversely, expression of the
FOXM1(5XK4R) mutant signiﬁcantly increased the percentage
of BrdU-positive MCF-7 cells (Figure 7e). Furthermore, we also
found that the SUMOylation-deﬁcient mutant FOXM1 is more
effective than WT-FOXM1 in overcoming the antiproliferative
effects of epirubicin (Supplementary Figure S13). Taken together,
the data indicate that epirubicin treatment promotes SUMOylation
of FOXM1, which downregulates FOXM1 expression and restrains
cell proliferation.
We next sought to determine whether the SUMOylation of
FOXM1 would perturb mitotic progression under otherwise
normal conditions. To test this hypothesis, we co-transfected
FOXM1-Ubc9 or 5X(K4R)-FOXM1-Ubc9 with a pmCherry expression vector into RPEhTert-GFP-a-tubulin cells (retinal pigmented
epithelial cell line stably transfected with human telomerase
reverse transcriptase and GFP-a-tubulin).27 Progression through
mitosis following synchronisation by double thymidine block was
monitored using time-lapse phase-contrast and ﬂuorescent
microscopy (Figure 8a and Supplementary Videos VS1 and VS2).
The FOXM15X(K4R)-Ubc9 mutant had no discernible effects on

time from mitotic entry to exit (Figure 8a), suggesting that
SUMOylation of FOXM1 is not required for normal progression of
cells through mitosis. However, the FOXM1-Ubc9 fusion protein
markedly increased the time needed for mitotic entry to
metaphase alignment, and also from metaphase alignment to
anaphase onset (Figure 8b). To further examine the mitotic delay
in response to persistent FOXM1 SUMOylation, we examined the
expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins following double
thymidine block and release in HeLa cells transfected with a
control vector or expression vectors encoding FOXM1-Ubc9 or
5X(K4R)-FOXM1-Ubc9. Intriguingly, expression of FOXM1-Ubc9,
but not 5X(K4R)-FOXM1-Ubc9, caused persistent cyclin B1
expression (Figure 8c). This suggested that the observed mitotic
delay may be due to inadequate cyclin B1 degradation, thus
delaying anaphase entry.28 Collectively, these data also
demonstrate that the SUMOylation of FOXM1 inhibits cell cycle
transition by delaying mitotic progression.

DISCUSSION
Overexpression of FOXM1 is a hallmark of various aggressive solid
carcinomas.29 It has a crucial role in the transformation of cells, in
the response of malignant cells to chemotherapeutic agents, and
in the development of drug resistance.1,4,8,10 We now provide
evidence that FOXM1 activity is controlled by SUMO1 conjugation
and deconjugation. We demonstrated that SUMOylation of
FOXM1 promotes its degradation in the cytoplasm by the APC/
Cdh1 complex, leading to loss of FOXM1 activity and,
consequently, mitotic delay. We also provide evidence that
enhanced FOXM1 SUMOylation is integral to the cellular
response to epirubicin and taxanes.
Our observations are in agreement with the broad and general
function of SUMOylation as an inhibitory post-translational
modiﬁcation for many transcription factors. Further, the interplay
between SUMOylation and ubiquitination has been shown to
control the subcellular localisation and stability of a number of
transcription factors, including PPARs,30 RXR,31 PGC-1,32 IRF3,33
Sp134 and SERCA2a.35 In most cases, SUMO-targeting E3 ubiquitin
ligases (STUbLs), such as RNF4, are recruited to SUMO-conjugated
target proteins, resulting in ubiquitination and subsequent
degradation. We demonstrate here that the Cdh1 subunit of the
APC complex mediates ubiquitination and degradation of FOXM1.
The N-terminal region of FOXM1 contains both destruction box (D
box) and KEN box sequences that are recognized and targeted by
the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cdh1 during mitotic exit.25 However, we
found that, although SUMOylation of FOXM1 is required for its
ubiquitination and degradation by the APC/Cdh1 complex, it does
not mediate the interaction of FOXM1 with APC/Cdh1, suggesting
other E3 ubiquitin ligases, including the SUMOylation-dependent.
This suggests that other E3 ubiquitin ligases, including STUbLs,
enzymes with SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligation activity (e.g. RNF4,
RNF8 and BRCA1),36–38 may be involved in recognizing
SUMOylated FOXM1. It is also possible that FOXM1 undergoes

further ubiquitination mediated by the mitosis-speciﬁc E3 ligase
Cdh1 following delays in M phase in response to DNA damage.
In support of this notion, STUbLs as well as Cdh1 have been
shown to be involved in mediating the DNA damage
response.39,40 However, STUbLs are E3 ubiquitin ligases that
bind preferentially to poly-SUMO2/3 chains but poorly to
monomers.38,41,42 However, there is evidence that certain target
proteins modiﬁed by SUMO1, such as PML-RARa,38,43,44 can recruit
STUbLs and be targeted for ubiquitination. It is possible that
clustering of multiple SUMOylation sites as found in FOXM1 and
other proteins may function in a similar manner as poly-SUMO2/3
chains in providing the interface for binding to SUMO-interacting
motifs of STUbLs.
FOXM1 has a central part in the response to the anticancer
genotoxic agent epirubicin. Accordingly, epirubicin causes a
decline in FOXM1 expression accompanied by cell death in the
sensitive MCF-7 breast cancer cells.1,10,11 We also observed here
that FOXM1-SUMOylation increases in response to epirubicin in
the MCF-7 cells, suggesting that FOXM1-SUMOylation negatively
regulates its expression and activity. FOXM1 regulates the
expression of genes important for DNA damage repair, cell
cycle control and cell survival, which are also involved in DNA
damage response.29 SUMOylation of FOXM1 mediates its
ubiquitination, degradation and cytoplasmic relocalization, which
will culminate in a decrease in its transcriptional activity.
Accordingly, our results show that the SUMOylation-deﬁcient
FOXM1 has a better transactivation activity compared with
WT-FOXM1. In consequence, FOXM1-SUMOylation has a key
role in DNA damage response and genotoxic drug sensitivity
through negatively regulating FOXM1-dependent transcription.
Consistently, the E3 ligases PIAS1 and -4, which mediate
SUMOylation in response to DNA damage, have been shown to
be essential for the subsequent DNA damage response.12
Collectively, these ﬁndings underscore the importance of
SUMOylation in regulating FOXM1 expression and activity. As
such, FOXM1-SUMOylation may function like a molecular switch
that ultimately controls DNA damage response and genotoxic
drug resistance.

METHODS AND MATERIALS

The FOXM1 and DN-FOXM1 plasmids have previously been described.45
The SUMO1, SUMO2, SUMO3 and Ubc-9 plasmids have previously been
described41,46 and were generous gifts from RT Hay (University of Dundee,
Dundee, UK). The SENP-1 and mutant SENP-1-C630S plasmids47 were gifts
from P O’Hare (Marie Curie Research Institute, Oxted, UK). FOXM1
SUMOylation sites were predicted using computational methods by
combining SUMOSp (http://bioinformatics.lcd-ustc.org/sumosp/)48 with
analysis of lysine residue conservation across FOXM1 orthologues using
Bioedit and ClustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw/) software. FOXM1
SUMOylation mutants were generated using the QuickChange SiteDirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Leicester, UK), as per the
manufacturer’s instructions, to generate lysine-to-arginine mutations. The

(a) the FOXM1 6X-DNA-binding element (6XDBE), (b) the wild-type cyclin B1 promoter (cyclin B1-pGL2) or the cyclin B1 promoter containing
mutations in the three consensus forkhead binding sites (cyclin B1-mut3-pGL2), or (c) the GADD45 promoter (GADD45-pGL2). After 8 h, cells
were placed in 0.5% fetal calf serum for 24 h before the luciferase assay was performed. All DNA concentrations were normalized using empty
vector. Reporter gene activity was expressed as a ratio of firefly luciferase activity to control Renilla luciferase activity. (d) MCF-7 cells were
transfected with FOXM1 with or without SUMO1. After 20 h, cells were treated with BrdU (10 mmol/l) for 4 h and then harvested and stained
with propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdU antibody and analysed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter

with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamine at 37 1C. For early
S-phase block, HeLa cells were exposed to double thymidine block (2 mM
thymidine for 18 h, fresh culture media for 10 h, 2 mM thymidine for 18 h,
and release into fresh media), and for mitotic block MCF-7 cells were
exposed to nocodazole (100 ng/ml; 16 h).

Cell fractionation, immunoprecipitation and western blotting
For western blot analysis, cells were lysed as described previously49 with
the addition of N-ethyl-amide (10 mM) (Sigma UK, Poole, UK) to the lysis
buffer. For immunoprecipitation and cell fractionation, see Supplementary
Materials and methods. Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl
sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE), transferred to
Hybond-C membranes and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.

Cell cycle and BrdU analysis
Propidium iodide staining was conducted as described previously.50 For
staining with BrdU, see Supplementary Materials and methods. The
analysis was conducted using a FACSCanto analyser (Becton Dickinson,
Oxford, UK); the cell cycle proﬁle was analysed using BD FACSDiva software
(Becton Dickinson).

In vitro SUMOylation assay
Human FOXM1 was cloned into an IPTG-inducible bacterial vector with a
C-terminal His-tag. Escherichia coli bacteria were transformed and grown in
the presence and absence of IPTG, and recombinant FOXM1 was puriﬁed
by nickel column under denaturing conditions and used for an in vitro
SUMOylation assay (Biomol, Enzo Life Sciences, Exeter, UK) with or without
Mg-ATP, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. RanGAP was used as a
positive control.

Confocal microscopy
MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with the eGFP-FOXM1 and tRFPSUMO1 plasmids, treated with epirubicin and ﬁxed as described. MCF-7
cells were washed with room temperature phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 10 min and washed again
with PBS. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in 0.2% bovine
serum albumin (BSA)-PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS and nonspeciﬁc
protein binding blocked with 2% BSA-PBS for 30 min. The blocking solution
was removed and the speciﬁed antibody was added in 1% BSA-PBS for
45 min, followed by washing with PBS. The process was repeated when
staining with two antibodies. The secondary antibodies were added (antirabbit 488 nM; anti-mouse 594 nM; Molecular Probes, Life Technologies) in
1% BSA-PBS for 45 min before a repeat wash with PBS. Mounting medium
containing 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAKO, Ely, UK) was added and a
coverslip was applied. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss
confocal microscope with LSM meta 510 software (Carl Zeiss, Cambridge,
UK). All experiments included a non-primary control and were repeated
with three independent experiments.

percentage of induction of the 6  Forkhead response element promoter8
and cyclin B1 promoter,51 where basal promoter activity was set as 100%.

Mitotic progression analysis
RPE-hTert cells expressing GFP-tagged a-tubulin (RPE-hTERT-GFP-a-tubulin
cells) (Clonetech)27 were injected with empty vector, pmCherry-FOXM1Ubc9 or pmCherry-FOXM15X(K4R)-Ubc9 and synchronized in the G1
phase by double thymidine block as described.52 Following removal of
thymidine, progression through mitosis was monitored by phase-contrast
and ﬂuorescent microscopy. Time from mitotic entry to exit, mitotic entry
to metaphase alignment and metaphase alignment to anaphase onset was
calculated on a total of 200 cells per condition from three independent
experiments. Only cells that were transfected with the pmCherry-tagged
FOXM1 constructs were included.

Microinjection and live cell microscopy
Mitotic progression was detected with live cell microscopy in RPE-hTert
cells expressing GFP-tagged a-tubulin followed by microinjection of
the following expression plasmids: control pmCherry-C1, pmCherry-C1
and FOXM1-Ubc9, pmCherry-C1 and FOXM15X(K4R)-Ubc9. The expression plasmids were coinjected at a maximum needle concentration of
300 ng/ml. Live cell microscopy was started 6 h after microinjection of cells
on the stage of a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Preston, UK). Images were
acquired at 12-min intervals using a Hamamatsu Orca camera (Hamamatsu
Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) for a total of 5 h. Times taken from mitotic
entry (starting of chromosome condensation) to exit (chromosome
decondensation in daughter cells), from mitotic entry to metaphase
alignment and from metaphase alignment to anaphase onset were
calculated. These mitotic phase analyses were performed only on mCherrypositive cells (n ¼ 30 per group). Uninjected cells were used as internal
control to ensure that delay in mitotic timing is not due to the procedure.
MetaMorph imaging software (Molecular Devices, Wokingham, UK) was
used as platforms for acquisition and assembly of the acquired time lapse
images.

Cell synchronization and western blotting
HeLa cells were transfected with empty vector, FOXM1-Ubc9 or
FOXM1(5XK4R)-Ubc9 and synchronized by double thymidine block as
described. Brieﬂy, HeLa cells were blocked in thymidine (2 mM) for 20 h,
removed for 6 h and blocked for another 16 h. Cells entered mitosis about
6–8 h after removing the second thymidine block. Progression of cells
through mitosis was monitored by detection of cyclin A, cyclin B1 and
securin. Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE gel electrophoresis and
immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.

FLIM-FRET
MCF-7 cells were seeded on a 96-well plate and transfected 24 h later with
0.1 mg per well of eGFP-FOXM1 (FRET donor) and 0.025 mg per well of either
tRFP-SUMO1 or tRFP empty vector (FRET acceptor) using XtremeGene HP
(Roche, Hertfordshire, UK). Treatment time course with 0.1 mM epirubicin
commenced 24 h later. Upon time-course completion, cells were washed
and immersed in imaging medium (Hank’s balanced salt solution þ
glucose þ L-glutamine) and imaged on a fully automated 96-well plate
reading FLIM microscope similar to that described previously.53 Conﬁgured
for wide-ﬁeld time-gated lifetime imaging, the instrument acquired FLIM
and acceptor intensity images for 420 ﬁelds of view in o95 min. Lifetime
decays were ﬁtted to a monoexponential model, accounting for
instrument response and background ﬂuorescence, using FLIMﬁt
(Imperial College London, London, UK).54

Statistical analysis
Luciferase assays
MCF-7 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Fugene-6
(Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Luciferase
activity was determined 24 h after transfection using the Perkin-Elmer
Luclite assay kit (Perkin-Elmer, Cambridge, UK). Renilla luciferase was used
for normalization. Luminescence was read using the 9904 Topcount
Perkin-Elmer plate reader and relative luciferase activity was expressed as a

All statistical analyses, unless otherwise speciﬁed, were carried out using
SPSS 15.0 (SPSS inc, Chicago, IL, USA) and Windows XP (Microsoft,
Redmond, WA, USA). Where appropriate, a two-tailed independent sample
t-test was performed or where more than two conditions were present an
analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test for data sets
showing signiﬁcant variance (Po0.05). The FLIM-FRET data were analysed
using Tukey’s HSD (honestly signiﬁcant difference) test.
