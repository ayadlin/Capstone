ABSTRACT
Anthracyclines are key components of human breast cancer chemotherapy. Here,
we explored the role of Akt signaling in anthracycline resistance.
The antitumor activity of doxorubicin and Akt inhibitor A-443654 alone or combined
was examined in estrogen receptor (ER) positive and negative human breast cancer
cell lines. Further, we examined mRNA changes induced by anthracyclines in locally
advanced breast cancers biopsied before and after treatment in two clinical trials.
Doxorubicin increased Akt phosphorylation in ER positive MCF7 and T47D cell
lines, with no effect in ER negative MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells. A-443654 was
significantly more cytotoxic in doxorubicin-resistant compared to doxorubicin-naïve
MCF7. This difference was not observed in MDA-MB231. Among 24 patients, AKT1
gene expression increased 24 hrs after the initial epirubicin exposure in ER positive
tumors responding to therapy (n=6), as compared to ER positive non-responders
(n=7) or ER negative tumors (n=11). In contrast, AKT1 mRNA changes after 16 weeks
of doxorubicin were unrelated to clinical response and ER status (n=30).
In conclusion, rapid Akt activation was observed in ER positive breast cancers
which responded to anthracyclines. Increased cytotoxicity of A-443654 in doxorubicinresistant MCF7 cells indicates a possible role for Akt inhibitors in ER positive breast
cancers where chemoresistance evolves.

cancer as well [4], and mTOR inhibition, combined with
trastuzumab and paclitaxel, prolonged progression-free
survival significantly among patients with hormone receptor
negative, HER2 positive breast cancer [5]. However, the
potential to treat chemoresistant breast cancer by inhibiting
PI3K signaling has not been thoroughly addressed thus far.
Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is the
main endogenous inhibitor of PI3K activation [6]. While
experimental studies revealed loss of PTEN function to
be associated with reduced sensitivity to doxorubicin
in breast and prostate cancer models, chemosensitivity
was restored by concomitant mTOR inhibition [7, 8].
Furthermore, increased Akt phosphorylation is observed in
doxorubicin-resistant ER positive, but not in ER negative
breast cancer cell lines [9–11]. In line with this, inhibitors
of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway can be employed to

INTRODUCTION
Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate
3-kinase
(PI3K)-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-S6
kinase (S6K) signaling (in short: PI3K signaling) is
upregulated in 25% of human breast cancers and has been
associated with resistance to endocrine as well as HER2
directed therapy [1–3]. PIK3CA, encoding the p110α
subunit of PI3K, harbors activating mutations in up to 45%
of luminal A breast cancers [4], which are typically estrogen
receptor (ER) positive tumors. Thus, therapeutic inhibition
of the PI3K signaling pathway with the mTOR inhibitor
everolimus can be used to counteract acquired resistance to
aromatase inhibitors and prolong survival among patients
with ER positive breast cancer [3]. Moreover, activating

enhance anthracycline sensitivity in ER positive breast
cancers [10, 11] Whereas the introduction of Akt inhibitors
in clinical trials has been slower than PI3K and mTOR
inhibitors [12], the key position of Akt as a signal hub for
important pro-tumorigenic pathways [6] makes such trials
highly relevant.
In the present work we assessed the influence of
doxorubicin treatment on PTEN and Akt-mTOR-S6K
signaling, and the interaction between doxorubicin and the
Akt inhibitor A-443654 in ER positive and negative human
breast cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo. In particular,
cell lines made resistant to doxorubicin by continous drug
exposure were compared with doxorubicin-naïve cells to
decipher the role of Akt-mTOR-S6K signaling in breast
cancer chemoresistance. Furthermore, the short-term and
long-term changes in PTEN and AKT1 gene expression
subsequent to anthracycline exposure were assessed in
patients with locally advanced breast cancers.

cells exposed to doxorubicin remains to be elucidated,
but the rapid changes in gene expression induced by
the chemotherapy could take longer to translate into a
change in protein levels, due to a half-life of more than
8 hrs for PTEN [13]. Furthermore, there is no strong
correlation between PTEN mRNA and PTEN protein
levels in human breast cancer, which could be explained
by post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms
modifying protein expression and stability [14].

Influence of doxorubicin treatment on Akt
activity and PI3K signaling in doxorubicinresistant cell lines
We performed the same experiments as outlined
above in MB231 and MCF7 cells made resistant to
doxorubicin through long-term doxorubicin exposure (see
Methods & materials).
While doxorubicin exposure for 24 hours increased
AKT1 gene expression in doxorubicin-resistant MCF7
cells, no significant change in AKT1 expression was
observed subsequent to doxorubicin expression in
MB231 cells (Supplementary Figure 2B). Notably,
PTEN gene expression was profoundly reduced 24 hrs
after doxorubicin exposure in doxorubicin-resistant
MB231, whereas a minor PTEN increase was observed
in doxorubicin-resistant MCF7 cells (Supplementary
Figure 2B). While p-Akt increased at the protein level
in doxorubicin-resistant compared to doxorubicin-naïve
MB231 cells, no change in downstream signaling was
observed. The level of p-Akt was increased in doxorubicinresistant MB231 cells, compared to doxorubicin-naïve
cells, but without any changes in downstream signaling
(Figure 1A, 1C). In doxorubicin-resistant MCF7 cells,
the protein levels of PTEN, p-Akt, mTOR and p-mTOR
were higher compared to doxorubicin-naïve cells (Figure
1B, 1D). However, an additional pulse of doxorubicin
treatment did not change PTEN or Akt-mTOR-S6K
protein levels further in doxorubicin-resistant MB231 or
MCF7 cells, compared to sham treatment (Figure 1C-D).

RESULTS
Influence of doxorubicin treatment on Akt
activity and PI3K signaling in doxorubicin-naïve
breast cancer cell lines
A sublethal concentration of doxorubicin (24 hrs
exposure) was established by the WST-1 assay, to facilitate
subsequent assessment of increased cytotoxicity when the
A-443654 Akt inhibitor was introduced. The IC30 was
approximately 1.5-2.0 μM for MB231 and MCF7 and
0.5-1.0 μM for T47D (Supplementary Figure 1A). Based
on this, doxorubicin was used at a concentration of 1.5
μM for MB231, 2 μM for MCF7 and 0.7 μM for T47D
for the in vitro experiments. Each experimental setup was
conducted in three parallel cell cultures.
Doxorubicin increased phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt)
in the ER positive MCF7 and T47D human breast cancer
cell lines (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 1B). In
contrast, p-Akt was not influenced by doxorubicin in
the ER negative MB231 cell line (Figure 1A). Whereas
doxorubicin had no impact on PTEN protein levels in
neither cell line, mTOR phosphorylation levels increased
in MB231 and decreased in MCF7 cells (Figure 1A1B), although not significant by densitometry (Figure
1E-1F). Phosphorylated S6K was weakly expressed in
both cell lines, and a non-significant decrease in S6K
phosphorylation levels was observed in the MCF7 cell line
after doxorubicin exposure (Figure 1A-1B).
AKT1 mRNA levels as determined by qPCR
analysis remained unaltered 24 hours after doxorubicin
exposure in all three cell lines (Supplementary Figure 2A).
While PTEN mRNA levels decreased in MB231 cells, no
change was observed in MCF7 and T47D cells subsequent
to doxorubicin treatment (Supplementary Figure 2A).
The reason why decreased PTEN mRNA levels did not
translate into decreased PTEN protein levels in MB231

Akt inhibition in doxorubicin-naïve and resistant
MB231 and MCF7 cell lines
Next, we examined the cytotoxicity of the Akt
inhibitor A-443654, alone or combined with doxorubicin,
in the ER negative MB231 and ER positive MCF7
cell lines. Moreover, based on the increased Akt
phosphorylation levels observed in the doxorubicinresistant cell lines, we compared the doxorubicin-naïve
and resistant cell lines with respect to Akt inhibitor
cytotoxicity.
First, it was established that the IC30 concentration
of A-443654 was 1.0 μM in MB231 and 0.5 μM in the
MCF7 cell line (Supplementary Figure 2C). A-443654 is
a known ATP competitive inhibitor of Akt, which causes
a transient increase in Akt phosphorylation at S473 [15].

In line with this, 2 hrs exposure to A-443654 increased
Akt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner in
MCF7 as well as MB231 cells (Figure 2A-2B). The
induction of Akt by A-443654 in ER negative MB231
cells was not influenced by doxorubicin resistance
(Figure 2A). However, in ER positive MCF7 cells,
the induction of Akt phosphorylation by A-443654
was significantly less prominent in doxorubicin-

resistant compared to doxorubicin-naïve cells (Figure
2B), suggesting that long-term doxorubicin exposure
exhausts the ability to activate Akt and could influence
the response to A-443654. Of notice, the baseline
phosphorylation level of Akt in doxorubicin-naïve
MB231 differed in Figure 1A and 2A, possibly due to
the use of different dissolvents given to control cells
in the two experiments; HPMC was used as dissolvent

for A-443654 (Figure 2A), whereas DMSO was the
dissolvent for doxorubicin (Figure 1A).
To decipher the consequence of Akt inhibition in a
wider time frame, Akt phosphorylation and downstream
signaling was assessed after 24 hrs of A-443654 (IC30)
exposure (Figure 2C-2D). As compared to 2 hrs, total
Akt was profoundly reduced after 24 hrs, suggesting the
Akt inhibitor may induce protein degradation. In parallel,
phosphorylated Akt remained upregulated after 24 hrs
of doxorubicin exposure in the doxorubicin-naïve as
well as the doxorubicin-resistant MCF7 and MB231 cell
lines, which is in accordance with the reported activity
of A-443654 [16]. With respect to downstream signaling,
it was clearly reduced by A-443654 in the doxorubicinnaïve MCF7 cell line, with decreased GSK3 and S6K
phosphorylation and increased 4EBP1 protein levels
(Figure 2D), and the same signaling inhibition was
observed in the doxorubicin-resistant MCF7 cell line.
The influence of A-443654 on Akt downstream signaling
was less pronounced in the MB231 cell line (Figure
2C). Whereas reduced GSK3 and increased 4EBP1
phosphorylation was observed in doxorubicin-naïve
MB231, Akt inhibition had no influence on phosphorylated
S6K. In doxorubicin-resistant MB231, A-443654 reduced
S6K and increased 4EBP1 phosphorylation, in accordance
with protein synthesis inhibition, but at the same time
phosphorylated GSK3 protein levels increased, indicating
glycogen synthase and cell cycle activation. All in all,
these results point to a stronger dependence on Akt
downstream signaling for cell proliferation in MCF7 than
in MB231 breast cancer cells when doxorubicin resistance
evolves.
Indeed, the Akt inhibitor exhibited significantly
increased cytotoxicity in doxorubicin-resistant compared
to doxorubicin-naïve MCF7 cells (Figure 3B). In contrast,
the cytotoxicity of A-443654 was significantly reduced
in doxorubicin-resistant compared to doxorubicin-naïve
MB231 cells (Figure 3A). The cytotoxicity of A-443654
was not augmented by doxorubicin in neither cell line
(Figure 3A-3B).

tumor growth significantly compared to A-443654 or sham
treatment, but only if A-443654 was postponed for a week
after commencing doxorubicin administration (treatment
group B). In contrast, co-administration of A-443654
and chemotherapy (treatment group A) diminished the
tumor growth inhibition induced by doxorubicin alone.
In MCF7, the combination of doxorubicin and A-443654
yielded significant tumor growth inhibition as compared to
A-443654 or sham treatment, but only if the Akt inhibitor
and doxorubicin were administered concomitantly
(treatment group A). In both breast cancer models there
was no significant difference in tumor response between
doxorubicin alone and doxorubicin combined with
A-443654.
Subcutaneous Akt inhibitor injections caused a
7% weight loss after 14 days of treatment, which was
comparable to combined treatment with doxorubicin and
A-443654. However, the observed weight loss precluded
further extension of the A-443654 treatment period, to
assess whether long-term Akt inhibiton could augment
the efficacy of doxorubicin. Unfortunately, two mice in
the doxorubicin and one mouse in the doxorubicin and
A-443654 group (A) had to be euthanized and taken out of
the MCF7 trial due to accidental injection of doxorubicin
into the gut wall and subsequent gut necrosis.
In a separate experiment, mice exposed to the
same treatment regimens as above were euthanized
after 14 days and tumor tissue extracted for molecular
analysis (doxorubicin-naïve MB231; n=3 mice/
group and MCF7; n=2 mice/group). As monotherapy,
A-443654 or doxorubicin yielded a heterogenous
increase in Akt phosphorylation in MCF7 and to
a lesser extent in MB231 xenografts, although not
significant by densitometry (Figure 4C-4D). Combined
treatment with A-443654 and doxorubicin increased
Akt phosphorylation in MCF7 xenografts significantly,
whereas the phosphorylation level of Akt in MB231
was unaffected by the combination regimen (Figure 4C4D). While Akt phosphorylation increased substantially
subsequent to 24 hours of A-443654 treatment in vitro
(Figure 2A-2D), this increase was less pronounced
in MB231 and MCF7 xenografts after two weeks of
A-443654 treatment (Figure 4C-4D).
Potential effects of Akt inhibition was further
monitored by analyzing downstream target effects (S6K
phosphorylation status). In doxorubicin-naïve MB231
tumors, protein analysis demonstrated significantly reduced
S6K phosphorylation after treatment with doxorubicin alone
or combined with A-443654 (Figure 4C). In doxorubicinnaïve MCF7 tumors, A-443654 or doxorubicin, either
alone or in combination, reduced mTOR phosphorylation
(Figure 4D). Gene expression analysis of PTEN, AKT1
and S6K in tumors extracted 14 days after commencing
therapy (Supplementary Figure 3) demonstrated a
significant decrease in AKT1 in MCF7 tumors subsequent
to doxorubicin exposure, but apart from this no definite

The efficacy of sham treatment, A-443654 or
doxorubicin, alone or in combination, was assessed
in NOD/SCID mice implanted orthotopically with
doxorubicin-naïve MB231 or MCF7 human breast cancer
(n=5-6 mice/group).
The Akt inhibitor A-443654 was ineffective as
monotherapy in MB231 tumors in mice, but inhibited
tumor growth significantly in MCF7 tumors (Figure
4A-4B). Doxorubicin treatment yielded significant
tumor inhibition in both cancer subtypes. In MB231,

neither MCF7 nor MB231.

response to therapy (Figure 5B). Interestingly, among the
ER positive tumors (n=13), AKT1 (p=0.040) as well as
PTEN levels (p=0.039) increased significantly in patients
who responded to therapy (n=6); whereas no change
in neither AKT1 nor PTEN levels was observed among
the non-responders (n=7, Figure 5B). Furthermore, S6K
decreased significantly (p=0.027) in ER positive tumors
that did not respond to therapy (n=7, Figure 5B).
After a median follow-up of 69 months, six out
of 24 patients from the dose dense trial had developed
breast cancer recurrence; no difference in gene expression
changes between patients relapsing and those not relapsing
was observed (Supplementary Figure 4).
To assess potential long-term effects of
anthracycline treatment, tumor samples collected from 30
patients with locally advanced breast cancers, before and
after 16 weeks of doxorubicin [30, 31], were examined for
long-term gene expression changes of PTEN and AKT1
(Supplementary Figure 5). Analysing all patients together,
no change in neither AKT1 nor PTEN expression was
observed. However, stratifying patients based on response
to therapy, PTEN expression increased significantly
(p=0.033) among non-responders (patients having a PD
or SD on therapy; n=17), in particular among ER negative
non-responders (n=4; p=0.026; Figure 6A-6B). In contrast,

Gene expression changes induced by
anthracyclines in human breast cancers
Next, to compare with the preclinical results, we
examined how anthracyclines affected acute and chronic
tumor gene expression by analyzing breast cancer samples
obtained before and 24 hours after the first epirubicin
(60 mg/m2 i.v.) course, or before and after 16 weeks
of weekly doxorubicin (14 mg/m2 i.v.). All 24 tumors
collected in the dose dense epirubicin trial (ClinicalTrials.
gov NCT00496795)expressed PTEN, AKT1 and S6K,
before and/or after treatment (Supplementary Figure 4).
Among the patients treated with epirubicin, AKT1 gene
expression increased significantly (p=0.016) in tumors that
subsequently regressed on treatment (PR; n=9), whereas
no change was observed in tumors that did not respond
(SD, PD; n=15, Figure 5A). The mRNA levels of PTEN
and S6K did not change significantly, neither among
responders nor non-responders (Figure 5A). Stratifying
patients according to ER status, neither AKT1, PTEN nor
S6K mRNA levels were influenced by epirubicin exposure
among ER negative tumors (n=11), independent of clinical

correlate to long-term outcome (Supplementary Figure 5).
The mutation status of PIK3CA and TP53 was
assessed in all the above tumor samples (Supplementary

TP53 mutated tumors (n=8). Upregulated AKT1 24 hrs
after the first epirubicin exposure was observed in six
out of 13 ER positive breast cancers which subsequently
regressed on this treatment (Figure 5); and four out of
these six tumors where AKT1 increased harbored wt

In tumors examined before and after 16 wks of

significantly after treatment (p=0.02) in tumors harboring

responders (n=7) or among TP53 wt tumors (data not
shown). Also, there was no significant change in AKT1,

subgroups were split by TP53 mutation status.

compounds seem better tolerated [20] and should be tested
in long-term combination schedules with anthracyclines.
Importantly, the combined efficacy of A-443654 and
doxorubicin was dependent on timing, where concomitant
administration of the Akt inhibitor and chemotherapy was
required for optimal tumor regression in MCF7 xenografts.
In contrast, co-administration of A-443654 with doxorubicin
reduced the efficacy of doxorubicin in MB231 xenografts.
Doxorubicin yielded rapid upregulation of phosphorylated
Akt in MCF7 cells in vitro, whereas long-term exposure
and induction of doxorubicin resistance was required
to upregulate phosphorylated Akt in MB231. This may
explain the different efficacy with respect to timing between
doxorubicin and the Akt inhibitor in the two cell lines.
Previous studies have revealed A-443654 to act as
an ATP competitive inhibitor of Akt; as such, it increases
Akt phosphorylation while at the same time inhibiting Akt
downstream signaling [15, 16]. Accordingly, A-443654
rapidly increased Akt phosphorylation, which was more
pronounced in the MCF7 as compared to the MB231 cell
line, and suggesting a particular responsiveness of the PI3KAkt-mTOR pathway in ER positive breast cancer cells.
However, the cytotoxicity of A-443654 was comparable
between MCF7 and MB231, and similar inhibition of Akt
downstream signaling was observed in the ER positive and
ER negative cell lines. In contrast, the activity of A-443654
was profoundly reduced in doxorubicin-resistant MB231
cells, where the inhibition of Akt signaling by A-443654 was
abrogated. Interestingly, doxorubicin resistance enhanced
the cytotoxicity of A-443654 significantly in MCF7, with
maintained inhibition of Akt downstream signaling. The
mechanisms behind the enhanced activity of A-443654 in
doxorubicin-resistant MCF7 cells remain to be established.
However, the baseline Akt phosphorylation level is higher
in the doxorubicin-resistant MCF7 cell line, as compared to
doxorubicin-naïve MCF7 cells, potentially explaining the
increased cytotoxicity towards A-443654.
In line with previous observations [10, 21], we
established that doxorubicin exposure increases Akt
phosphorylation in the ER positive MCF7 and T47D
human breast cancer cell lines, but not the ER negative
MB231 cell line. Herein we expand upon these data to
show that MCF7 cells made resistant to doxorubicin
exhibit a higher constitutive Akt phosphorylation levels
which is not affected by further doxorubicin exposure. The
increased cytotoxicity of Akt inhibition in doxorubicinresistant MCF7 breast cancer cells points to a potential
use of such a drug class in ER positive breast cancer, in
particular if resistance to anthracycline has developed
and Akt phosphorylation levels are elevated. Importantly,
while the Akt inhibitor exhibited increased cytotoxicity
in doxorubicin-resistant compared to doxorubicin-naïve
MCF7 breast cancer, we did not examine whether Akt
inhibitors can be used to reverse doxorubicin resistance,
but this issue should be addressed in future trials.
However, upregulated PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling is

DISCUSSION
Patients with ER positive as well as ER negative
breast cancer obtain improved survival from adjuvant
polychemotherapy [17], but the benefit of chemotherapy is
less in typical luminal A tumors with strong ER expression
compared to other subtypes [18]. The mutational
landscape of breast cancer subtypes differ substantially,
with a high prevalence of activating PIK3CA mutations in
ER positive, luminal or HER2-enriched tumors, whereas
inactivating TP53 mutations are commonly observed in
ER negative subtypes [4]. Moreover, while activating
AKT1 mutations are rare in human breast cancers, they
occur more frequently among luminal or HER2-enriched
(2-4%) than basal-like tumors (0%) [4], suggesting a
selection pressure towards increased Akt signaling in
these neoplasms. Accordingly, the PI3K-Akt-mTOR
pathway has been targeted therapeutically to counteract
acquired resistance to endocrine therapy and combined
trastuzumab-chemotherapy in clinical trials [1, 3, 5, 19].
However, the importance of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling to
chemoresistance has not been fully elucidated.
Here, we systematically explored alterations in this
pathway in response to anthracycline and/or Akt inhibition
in ER positive and negative breast cancer cell lines
and their concomitant xenografts and to anthracycline
treatment in human breast cancers.
We established that the Akt inhibitor A-443654
reduces cell proliferation both in the ER positive MCF7
and the ER negative MB231 cell line in vitro. However,
Akt inhibition yielded tumor regression in MCF7 and not
MB231 in vivo, and doxorubicin significantly augmented
this tumor response only in MCF7 xenografts. Of notice,
A-443654 caused significant weight loss which was
intolerable beyond 14 days, and we therefore could
not explore its full potential alone or combined with
anthracyclines. Toxicity was a similar problem in the first
clinical trials testing Akt inhibitors, although next generation

clearly associated with chemoresistance, which has
been shown in various preclinical cancer models, and
chemotherapy response can be augmented in this setting
by simultaneous PI3K or Akt inhibition [10, 11, 22–24], in
particular in ER positive breast cancer [10, 22].
Finally, we provide clinical data demonstrating that
increased AKT1 gene expression 24 hours after epirubicin
exposure characterizes ER positive, but not ER negative,
primary breast cancers that subsequently regress on
anthracycline treatment. Interestingly, no change in tumor
AKT1 expression was observed in patients after 16 weeks
of doxorubicin, suggesting an intermittent Akt response
where the efficacy of Akt inhibitors could depend on
timing. Furthermore, an increased AKT1 mRNA level 24
hrs after the first chemotherapy course could potentially
be used as a biomarker identifying ER positive tumors
likely to respond to chemotherapy. The reason why
elevated AKT1 mRNA is associated with good response
remains to be elucidated. However, if high AKT1 translates
into increased Akt activation throughout the duration
of chemotherapy, chronic Akt activation may promote
senescence and apoptosis by downregulating MDM2
and increasing p53 in breast cancers with preserved p53
function [25, 26]. Of notice, among the ER positive
breast cancers which responded to epirubicin, four out
of six tumors with upregulated AKT1 after chemotherapy
harbored wt TP53 status.
In contrast to the patient data, AKT1 mRNA levels
were not affected in the MB231 and MCF7 human breast
cancer cell lines after 24 hrs chemotherapy exposure. The
reason for this discrepancy remains to be elucidated, but
could be due to the admixture of tumor cells and stroma
in patient tumor samples in contrast to the pure tumor cell
content in the in vitro cultures. Unfortunately, we did not
have patient samples available for proteinanalysis of Akt
and Akt signaling to compare with the gene expression
data. Furthermore, the induction of Akt phosphorylation
by A-443654 which was observed in MB231 and MCF7
in vitro, was not detected in the corresponding xenografts.
Again, the admixture of tumor cells and stroma cells in
vivo, as well as the heterogeneity between the xenografts
may explain the lack of correlation between the in vivo
and in vitro findings. Moreover, the xenografts used for the
proteinanalysis were extracted after 14 days of treatment
compared to the 2 hrs and 24 hrs of treatment in the in
vitro experiments. The reason why decreased PTEN
mRNA levels did not decrease PTEN protein levels in
MB231 cells after 24 hrs exposure to doxorubicin also
remains to be established. Whereas rapid changes in gene
expression are induced by the chemotherapy, protein
changes may take longer to develop due to the relatively
long half-life of PTEN (>8 hrs) [13]. Furthermore, there
is no strong correlation between PTEN mRNA and PTEN
protein levels in human breast cancer [14], which could
be explained by post-transcriptional and post-translational
mechanisms modifying protein expression and stability.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In conclusion, our data point to upregulated Akt
expression as a recurrent initial response to anthracyclines
in ER positive human breast cancers, and in particular,
among patients who respond to chemotherapy.
Furthermore, we observed increased sensitivity to
Akt inhibition in doxorubicin-resistant, compared to
doxorubicin-naïve, ER positive MCF7 breast cancer
cells. Accordingly, the benefit of Akt inhibition is clearly
context-dependent, with respect to ER status and previous
anthracycline exposure. Thus far, the role of Akt inhibitors
to augment the efficacy of chemotherapy in solid tumors
has not been dealt with to a large extent, despite promising
preclinical and clinical data [23, 24, 27–29] and should
be explored further, in particular in ER positive breast
cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethical declaration
The authors declare that the experiments within this
paper comply with the ethical standards and current laws
in Norway.

Cell lines
The ER positive MCF7 and T47D and the ER
negative MDA-MB-231 (MB231) human breast cancer
cell lines were used for all the preclinical experiments.
For cell growth conditions and cell line identity, see
Supplementary methods. Doxorubicin (Adriamycin,
Pfizer) was diluted to 2 mg/ml in DMSO 99% for cell
culture experiments, stored as frozen aliquots (-20°C), and
prepared fresh by dilution in complete cell culture medium
for each experiment to preserve drug stability. Control
cells were always incubated with an equivalent volume
of DMSO 99% as cells exposed to medium containing
doxorubicin. A-443654 (AbbVie) was dissolved in 0.2%
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC, Sigma) prior
to use. For comparison, control cells were given an
equivalent volume of HPMC as those cells exposed to
A-443654.

Generation of doxorubicin-resistant cell lines
Doxorubicin-naïve MB231 and MCF7 cells were
grown in gradually increasing doxorubicin concentrations
over several months. When the cells were subconfluent
they were exposed to growth medium containing twice
the previous concentration of doxorubicin, and this was
repeated until a dose was reached, where the cells would
not expand any further. At this point, the cells had acquired
resistance to doxorubicin 1.5 μM (MB231 dox-res) and
doxorubicin 0.65 μM (MCF7 dox-res), each by exposure
for 48 hrs. The cells were maintained in doxorubicin-free
medium, but exposed to doxorubicin at their resistance

dose every two weeks to maintain resistance. Control cells
were propagated in medium with an equivalent volume of
DMSO. To determine the acute response to doxorubicin in
doxorubicin-resistant cells, the cells were seeded at 3x105
in 6-well dishes (Nunc) and incubated for 24 hrs until 70%
confluence. The medium was then replaced by medium
containing either doxorubicin or DMSO, and cells were
incubated for another 24 hrs before the cells was harvested
and RNA and protein isolated.

The maximum tolerable dose (MTD) of doxorubicin,
given weekly for two following weeks, with or without
the Akt inhibitor A-443654 was initially assessed in nontumor bearing NOD/SCID mice before commencing the
therapy trial in xenograft-implanted mice. Doxorubicin
was dissolved in 0.9% NaCl (Baxter) and injected i.p. once
weekly for two consecutive weeks to establish an MTD of
1.25 mg/kg qW. A-443654 was dissolved in HPMC and
administered subcutaneously at 3.75 mg/kg BID for 14
consecutive days, based on dosage reported elsewhere
[16]. In the combination treatment groups, administration
of A-443654 commenced either upfront (A), 24 hours after
the first doxorubicin injection (to treat primary resistance
due to high Akt signaling), or started as a delayed regimen
(B) at the same time as the second doxorubicin injection
(to counteract doxorubicin-induced acquired resistance
due to upregulated Akt signaling). Control mice were
given 0.2% HPMC s.c. and 0.9% NaCl i.p.
In a separate experiment, three MB231 mice and
two MCF7 mice per group were sacrificed at the end of 14
days of treatment (as given in the treatment trial above) for
protein analysis. All animals were euthanized by cervical
dislocation two hours after the last injection of A-443654
or sham treatment, and tissue samples from the tumor as
well as all organs snap-frozen on liquid N2 and stored at
-80°C.
The animal experiments were performed with the
approval of and in accordance with guidelines by the
Norwegian State Commission for Laboratory Animals.

In vitro activity and cytotoxicity of A-443654 and
doxorubicin
Subconfluent MB231 and MCF7 cells (in T25
flasks), either doxorubicin-naïve or doxorubicin-resistant,
were exposed to increasing concentrations of Akt inhibitor
A-443654 or HPMC (control) to assess the influence on
Akt phosphorylation, and protein was harvested after
2 hrs. To evaluate the influence of the Akt inhibitor on
Akt phosphorylation and downstream signaling after 24
hrs, cells were exposed to A-443654 at the IC30 (1 μM
MB231, 0,5 μM MCF7), before harvesting protein.
To assess the influence of doxorubicin +/- Akt
inhibitor A-443654 on cell viability, 5000 MB231, 1500
MCF7 or 20000 T47D cells were seeded per well in 96well plates (Falcon), and allowed to attach over night
in complete medium. Thereafter the drug(s) was added,
before culturing the cells for another 24 hours. Cell
proliferation after drug exposure was assessed by the
WST-1 assay (Roche), as described in the manufacturer´s
manual.

Patient breast cancer samples
The short-term effect of anthracyclines on PTEN,
AKT1 and S6K gene expression was assessed in a selected
cohort of 14 ER positive and 11 ER negative breast
cancers biopsied before and 24 hrs after receiving their
first course of epirubicin as part of the “dose dense trial”
(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00496795) wherein treatmentnaïve patients with locally advanced breast cancer were
given dose dense neoadjuvant epirubicin 60 mg/m2 q2w
(four courses) followed by docetaxel 100 mg/m2 q2w
(four courses). The presence of pre-treatment PIK3CA
and TP53 mutations in all tumor samples were examined
as described in Supplementary methods. One ER positive
tumor pair was excluded due to poor RNA quality, leaving
24 tumor pairs for analysis.
Furthermore, to analyze for long-term effects of
anthracyclines on PTEN and AKT1 mRNA levels, gene
expression was assessed in paired tumor samples from
30 patients with treatment-naïve locally advanced breast
cancer in the “doxorubicin trial”, biopsied before and
after 16 wks of neoadjuvant doxorubicin 14 mg/m2 qW
treatment [30, 31]. Briefly, tumor pairs for mRNA analysis
were available from 24 patients with ER positive and six
patients with ER negative locally advanced breast cancer.

Gene expression analysis and western blots
Therapy-induced changes in gene and protein
expression were assessed using qPCR and western blot
analyses. Detailed methods, primers and antibodies are
described in Supplementary methods.

In vivo cytotoxicity of A-443654 and doxorubicin
NOD/SCID mice were bred and mouse crossings
performed inhouse at the Animal Facility, University of
Bergen. Adult mice of fertile age were anesthetized with
isoflurane (Baxter) before 1x106 MCF7 or MB231 cells were
injected orthotopically in the fourth left inguinal mammary
gland. The tumors were measured every 3-4 days using
Vernier calipers, and tumor volumes were calculated using
the formula a2b/2, where a and b are the shorter and longer
diameter of the tumors respectively. Treatment commenced
when the tumors had reached 4-6 mm in diameter, and
the animals were stratified into groups according to tumor
size. The mice were euthanized if signs of serious distress
occurred or when the first tumor in any treatment group had
a tumor diameter exceeding 17 mm.
