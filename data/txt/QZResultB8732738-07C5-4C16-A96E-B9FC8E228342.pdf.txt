Abstract
Apoptotic desensitization is a hallmark of cancer cells, but present knowledge of molecular systems controlling
apoptosis has yet to provide signiﬁcant prognostic insights. Here, we report ﬁndings from a systems study of the
intrinsic pathway of apoptosis by BCL2 family proteins and clinical translation of its ﬁndings into a model with
applications in colorectal cancer (CRC). By determining absolute protein quantiﬁcations in CRC cells and patient
tumor samples, we found that BAK and BAX were expressed more highly than their antiapoptotic inhibitors. This
counterintuitive ﬁnding suggested that sole inhibition of effector BAX and BAK could not be sufﬁcient for systems
stability in nonstressed cells. Assuming a model of direct effector activation by BH3-only proteins, we calculated
that the amount of stress-induced BH3-only proteins required to activate mitochondrial apoptosis could predict
individual death responses of CRC cells to 5-ﬂuorouracil/oxaliplatin. Applying this model predictor to protein
proﬁles in tumor and matched normal tissue samples from 26 patients with CRCs, we found that differences
in protein quantities were sufﬁcient to model the increased tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy compared
with normal tissue. In addition, these differences were sufﬁcient to differentiate clinical responders from
nonresponders with high conﬁdence. Applications of our model, termed DR_MOMP, were used to assess the
impact of apoptosis-sensitizing dugs in lowering the necessary dose of state-of-the-art chemotherapy in
individual patients. Together, our ﬁndings offer a ready clinical tool with the potential to tailor chemotherapy
to individual patients. Cancer Res; 73(2); 519–28. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Most chemotherapeutics kill cancer cells by triggering programmed cell death or apoptosis (1). Perturbations in the
apoptotic machinery contribute to carcinogenesis and are a
major cause of chemo- and radiotherapy resistance (2). Hence,
interindividual heterogeneity in tumor gene expression and
protein proﬁles often limit the efﬁciency of standard-of-care,
one size-ﬁts-it-all chemotherapy paradigms. Therefore,
patient-stratiﬁed treatment paradigms and dosage decisions
are increasingly needed, requiring new tools that incorporate
patient-speciﬁc, molecular data sets.
For stage II and III colorectal cancer (CRC), current treatment involves surgical resection followed by adjuvant therapy

with genotoxic stress inducers oxaliplatin or irinotecan in
combination with the antimetabolite 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU;
ref. 3). Genotoxic chemotherapeutics activate the BCL2 protein
family–controlled process of mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization (MOMP; refs. 4, 5). MOMP is executed by
oligomerization of the proapoptotic BCL2 effector proteins
BAK and BAX (6), which form pores in the mitochondrial outer
membrane releasing apoptotic proteins that further activate
caspase-dependent and -independent cell death pathways (4).
In the absence of stress, BAK and BAX are inhibited by
antiapoptotic BCL2 family proteins, including MCL1, BCL(X)
L, and BCL2. Upon genotoxic stress and other stressors, a
further apoptotic subclass of BCL2 proteins, the BH3-only
proteins such as BID, BIM, and PUMA, are induced and derepress BAK and BAX from its inhibitors. Some BH3-only
proteins may also activate BAK and BAX directly (7).
Several proteins involved in executing apoptosis prior or
subsequent to MOMP, including BCL2 family members, have
been proposed as molecular markers for cancer diagnosis and
for patient stratiﬁcation (8–11). However, the complexity of the
interaction of antagonizing BCL2 family proteins makes it
unlikely that mutations or deregulation of single apoptosisrelated proteins are sufﬁcient to characterize apoptosis execution or its impairment in patients. Therefore, holistic
approaches studying the interplay of several proteins and
including quantitative protein levels and interaction kinetics
may be of signiﬁcant interest (12–16). However, no model of

BCL2 interaction and MOMP execution has yet been transferred into a clinical setting.
We here provide a computational systems model of MOMP
regulation that integrates data on the interaction of pro- and
antiapoptotic BCL2 proteins (17). By quantifying cell- and
tissue-speciﬁc protein levels, the model developed allowed an
assessment of the sensitivity of CRC cell lines to genotoxic
stress and to differentiate patients with CRCs into clinical
responders and nonresponders.

Materials and Methods
Patient cohort
Patient tissue was collected and stored from the Departments of Surgery, Gastroenterology, and Pathology, Beaumont
Hospital, Dublin, Ireland. Tumor tissue was collected from 8
patients with stage II or 18 patients with stage III CRCs along
with matched adjacent normal tissue. Clinical follow-up was
obtained through a review of medical records by a clinical
research nurse. Patients showing 4 years of disease-free survival were classiﬁed as favorable outcome and patients whose
cancer recurred or who died from CRC as unfavorable outcome. Patients with hereditary forms of CRCs were excluded.
Ethical approval was obtained by the Beaumont Hospital
Ethics Committee, and informed consent was obtained from
all patients. Tissue was stored as snap-frozen (80 C) or in
RNAlater (Ambion;20 C). Tables 1 and 2 details the patient
clinical characteristics and treatments.
Absolute protein quantiﬁcations
Patient tissue was lysed in 500 mL ice-cold buffer [50 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L Na-EDTA] and
protease inhibitor (Sigma) and homogenized on ice. Samples
were centrifuged at 14,000  g for 10 minutes, supernatant
collected and stored at 80 C. HeLa and CRC cell lysates were
prepared similarly. For quantitative Western blotting, stan-

dard curves were constructed with varying concentrations
(0.1–10.0 ng) of recombinant BAX (a kind gift from Prof.
Christoph Borner), BAK (Abnova), BCL2 (R & D Systems),
BCL(X)L (Abnova), and MCL1 (a kind gift from Prof. Christoph

Western Blot images were acquired using a LAS-3000 Imager
(FUJIFILM UK Ltd. Systems) and densitometry was conducted
using ImageJ software. The intracellular concentration of each
protein was calculated as previously described (14).
Brieﬂy, Western blotting was conducted using different
concentrations of recombinant proteins of BAK, BAX, BCL2,
BCL(X)L, and MCL1. From these blots, a calibration curve was
established for each protein, relating blot intensity to mass of
loading (in mg; Fig. 3A). Subsequently, 20 mg of HeLa cell lysate
was blotted and analyzed by densitometry. The total mass of

the investigated proteins in the lysate was obtained from the
calibration curves. Finally, assuming a HeLa cell volume of 3.1
pL (14) and the appropriate molecular weights for BAK, BAX,
BCL2, BCL(X)L, and MCL1, cellular concentrations for these
proteins were calculated (Fig. 3B).
Protein concentrations in the CRC cell lines and the patient
samples were determined by comparison to signals from HeLa
cell extracts as previously described (14, 18). Primary antibodies to MCL1 (1:250; BD Biosciences), BCL2 (1:100; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), BCL(X)L (1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc.), and b-actin (1:5,000; Sigma) were mouse monoclonal.
Antibodies to BAK (1:250; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and
BAX (1:1,000; Upstate Biotechnology) were rabbit polyclonal.
The horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch.
Mathematical model of stress dependency of MOMP
Absolute protein levels of the BCL2 family proteins BAK,
BAX, BCL2, BCL(X)L, and MCL1 were used as model input and,
therefore, were determined in the CRC cell lines Colo-205,
HCT-116 (wild-type), HCT-116 puma/, HCT-116 p53/,
HT-29, and LoVo, as well as in the patients' tumor and matched
normal tissue. Expression of BCLW was not evident in any of
the CRC cell lines or the patient-derived tissue. BH3-only
proteins BAD, which is primarily regulated by AKT (19), or
BMF, which plays a role in anoikis (20) but no predominant role
in genotoxic stress (21) were disregarded. In the absence of
genotoxic stress, no functional BH3-only proteins BIM, PUMA,
and NOXA were assumed to be present.
Genotoxic stress was modeled to be p53-dependent and to
involve the upregulation of the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins
PUMA and NOXA (22). In addition, we modeled a FOXO3- (or
E2F1-) dependent upregulation of BIM (23, 24). Production
rates of all 3 proteins were assumed to be identical and
modeled by a step function. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, production of BIM, PUMA, and NOXA was modeled to proceed at a
constant rate until termination after 12 hours. The entire
protein production over 12 hours was deﬁned as (protein) dose
h and used throughout the study as means to model stress
severity. We considered an increased rate of MCL1 degradation
upon genotoxic stress as shown previously (25) by modeling a
drop of the MCL1 half-life from 45 to 17 minutes (Supplementary Table S2).
Protein production, degradation, and interactions were
modeled by a pseudo-reaction network using mass action
kinetics, translated into a set of ordinary differential equation
(ODE) and solved using the MATLAB 7.3 (MathWorks, R2007b,
7.5.0.342) function ode15s. The detailed signaling pathways of
the BCL2 family proteins are described in the Supplementary
Modeling Details and Supplementary Tables S1–S7. Brieﬂy, the
antiapoptotic proteins BCL2, BCL(X)L, and MCL1 were modeled to bind to the proapoptotic proteins BIM, PUMA, and
NOXA (and tBID wherever indicated) were modeled to be
activated by BIM, PUMA, or tBID and to oligomerize unless
they were inhibited by above antiapoptotic proteins. Effector
homo-oligomers larger or equal to hexamers were considered
as mitochondrial pores (26). MOMP was assumed to occur
once 10% of the total effectors have formed pores as pre-

viously experimentally deducted (27). BH3-mimetics ABT737 (28) and ApoG2 (29) were assumed to bind to and inhibit
antiapoptotic proteins (Supplementary Table S6A), thereby
facilitating apoptosis execution. To determine the minimal
BH3-only stress to induce MOMP (Fig. 3–5), an iterative
procedure was used. This procedure varied the protein dose
in the model until the minimal dose h for which MOMP was
achieved was determined within a range of 1.2  102 nmol/
L. To test correlation of model predictions with survival of
cell populations subsequent to administration of 5-FU/oxaliplatin, Pearson correlation analysis and Wilcoxon ranksum were conducted using the MATLAB routines corr and
ranksum. For the statistical analysis of the predicted stress
dose h for the patients' tissue, as well as for analysis of
patients outcome, the Wilcoxon signed an unsigned ranksum test were conducted using the MATLAB routines signrank and ranksum. A separator of h ¼ 300 nmol/L and the
statistical software PASW (SPSS Inc., version 18) using the
in-built log-rank test were used to test statistical independence between different Kaplan–Meier curves.
Qualitative analysis of activator and effector inhibition
As described in Llambi and colleagues (30), 2 tBID chimeras,
tBIDBAK and tBIDBAX, were considered where the BH3 domains
of tBID were replaced by the BH3 domains of either BAK or
BAX. tBIDBAK and tBIDBAX binding afﬁnities to the antiapoptotic protein were modeled to be the same as for the protein
(BAK or BAX) from where the BH3 domain was taken (Supplementary Table S7A). Activation kinetics of BAK and BAX by
each chimera were taken from those of native tBID (Supplementary Table S4AB and S7B). A protein dose h of 1 mmol/L of
either tBIDBAK (B) and tBIDBAX (C) was assumed with 500
nmol/L of BAK and no BAX (B) or cells with 500 nmol/L of BAX
and no BAK (C). BCL2 or MCL1 were administered at speciﬁed
doses. The maximum amount of BAK or BAX pores was
calculated. The amount of pores in the area plots were normalized to 500 nmol/L.
Cell lines and culture
HCT-116 wt, p53/, and puma/ cells were obtained from
Prof. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore,
MD). Colo-205, HT-29, and LoVo cells were obtained from Dr.
Ken Nally (University College Cork, Cork, Ireland). The HeLa
cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (LGC Standards). The authenticity of the cell lines was
conﬁrmed by DNA STR proﬁling conducted by the DSMZ in
October 2012. The genotype of the HCT-116 cells was veriﬁed
by Western blotting. Colo-205, HeLa, and HCT-116 cells were
maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and
100 mg/mL streptomycin at 37 C in 5% CO2. HT-29 and LoVo
cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Media
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 U/mL penicillin,
and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.

Results
An in silico model for studying MOMP in response to
genotoxic stress
We devised a computational model to study cellular BCL2
protein interaction and the process of MOMP in response
to genotoxic stress (Fig. 1). We modeled genotoxic stress to
induce the BH3-only proteins BIM, PUMA, and NOXA (31–33),
whose expression levels we considered as surrogate of the
chemotherapeutic dose and that lead to an interaction of
pro- and antiapoptotic proteins resulting in effector (BAK and
BAX) homo-oligomerization. MOMP was assumed to occur
when homo-oligomers larger than or equal to hexamers (further denoted as pores; ref. 26) bound more than 10% of total
effectors (12). The antiapoptotic proteins BCL2, BCL(X)L, and
MCL1 were modeled to attenuate MOMP by engaging the

522

BH3-only proteins and effectors. We modeled effector activation to require an activation step by PUMA or BIM. In the
following section, we calculated the amount of effector pores
under a given stress. Subsequently, we calculated and analyzed
the minimum dose of BH3-only proteins necessary to induce
MOMP (dose h in further, see Materials and Methods) in
particular cells or patient tissues.
Systems modeling resembles experimental ﬁndings of
two-step repression of MOMP
Every newly devised in silico model should be consistent
with established qualitative and quantitative experimental
data (12). Therefore, we investigated whether our model was
able to reproduce the experimental ﬁndings of Llambi and
colleagues (30). In this study, tBID chimeras, tBIDBAK and
tBIDBAX, were constructed whereby the BH3-domain of tBID
was replaced with either those of BAK or BAX. Using the
above model, we assumed an artiﬁcial cell line as described
in Materials and Methods and resembled settings where

mmol/L of either a tBIDBAK (B) or a

time period. The initial amounts of
the antiapoptotic proteins BCL2 or
MCL1 were varied as noted.
Treatment of either BAK/ cells with
BCL2 or BAX/ cells with MCL1
(both type II) required less
antiapoptotic protein to prevent
MOMP than treatment of either
BAX/ cells (expressing BAK; B)
with BCL2 or BAK/ cells
(expressing BAX; C) with MCL1
(type I).

Anti apoptotic protein concentration (BCL2 or MCL1) [µmol/L]

antiapoptotic proteins only inhibited the activator and not the
effector (Fig. 2A, denoted as I). We implemented this by
modeling BAX/ cells (expressing BAK) to be exposed only to
tBIDBAX and BCL2 (binding to the tBIDBAX and not to BAK) and
by modeling BAK/ cells (expressing BAX) to be exposed to
tBIDBAK and MCL1 (binding to tBIDBAK and not BAX). In turn,
effector repression (II) was investigated by assuming either
BAX-deﬁcient cells to be exposed to tBIDBAX and MCL1 or
BAK-deﬁcient cells to be exposed to tBIDBAK and BCL2. For all
simulations, BCL(X)L was disregarded.
With these speciﬁc settings, we calculated the amount of BAK
(or BAX) pores in BAX/ (or BAK/) cells in the presence of
either only BCL2 or MCL1 and under different initial concentrations ranging from 0 to 2 mmol/L. Results for BAX/ (Fig. 2B)
and BAK/ (Fig. 2C) cells are depicted by in silico area plots (in
analogy to Fig. 4A; ref. 30) where the area of the bar is proportional to the calculated maximum amount of pores that is
present during a period of 96 hours. In both cells types, less
antiapoptotic protein is required to prevent pore formation
when they bind to the effector (II) than when they bind to the
activator (I), as shown by Llambi and colleagues (30).
The model predicted BH3-only stress dose h required for
MOMP correlates with sensitivity of CRC cell lines to
chemotherapeutic agents
Initial model calculations for HCT-116 and HeLa cells suggested that whether or not MOMP is induced upon the same
genotoxic stress may depend on expression levels of BCL2

family members (Supplementary Fig. S1 and S2). We therefore
determined absolute levels of BAK, BAX, BCL2, BCL(X)L,
and MCL1 in the CRC cell lines Colo-205, HCT-116, HCT116 p53/, HCT-116 puma/, HT-29, and LoVo (Fig. 3A–C
and Supplementary Table S8). The expression of BCLW was not
detectable in any of the cell lines investigated (data not shown;
ref. 34). Likewise, expression of BFL-1/A1/BCL2A1 is mainly
limited to cells of hematologic origin (35). Strikingly, despite
cell line speciﬁc differences, most cell lines showed higher
expression levels of BAK and BAX than total levels of the
combined levels of the quantiﬁed antiapoptotic proteins (Fig.
3C). This striking result challenges the notion that apoptosis
can be prevented by sole effector repression.
We investigated whether predictions of our model correlated to the susceptibility of different CRC cell populations to
genotoxic stress. Apoptosis activation was quantiﬁed after
treatment with 30 mg/mL of 5-FU and 10 mg/mL oxaliplatin
for 48 hours. Cell death in the p53-mutated or -deﬁcient
cell lines was low (40%, 23%, and 20% for Colo-205, HCT-116
p53/, and HT-29 cells), whereas 70% and 42% cell death was
observed in the p53-competent cell lines, HCT-116 and LoVo,
respectively. Cell death in HCT-116 puma/ cells was 60%.
Next, we addressed whether our model was sufﬁcient to
account for the differential sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic
agents. To identify a model predictor for cell death, we assumed
that stress due to 5-FU/oxaliplatin treatment would induce
expression of BIM, PUMA, and NOXA in p53- and PUMAcompetent cells, expression of BIM in p53-mutated or

-deﬁcient cells, and expression of BIM only and NOXA in HCT116 puma/ cells. We next assumed that the model predicted
BH3-only stress that is required to induce MOMP (dose h) in
response to genotoxic stress in a typical cell would be a good
predictor for the apoptosis susceptibility of a population.
Results of our analysis are depicted in Fig. 3D. Indeed, dose
h showed a positive correlation with cell survival, suggesting
that a more sensitive cell population required less genotoxic
stress in the model (R2 ¼ 0.70; Pearson coefﬁcient ¼ 0.84; P ¼
0.04).
The minimal stress-induced BH3-only protein dose h
that is required for MOMP is a model predictor for tumor
sensitivity and clinical outcome in CRC patients
As the model predicted dose h may represent a surrogate of
the stress in a cell required for MOMP, we reasoned that it may
also estimate the sensitivity of cells to chemotherapeutics. We
obtained primary tumor and matched normal tissue for 8
patients with stage II and 18 patients with stage III CRCs with
known clinical outcome (Tables 1 and 2). Patients with favorable
outcome were deﬁned as showing 4 years of disease-free survival, whereas unfavorable outcome were deﬁned as patients
showing recurrence or death from disease within 4 years.
We subsequently obtained absolute protein expressions of
BCL2 proteins (Fig. 4A–C and Supplementary Table S9) from
the resected tumor tissue and matched normal tissue and
calculated the model predicted dose h that is needed to induce
MOMP in the respective tissue. Strikingly, on average over all

patients, our model predicted that tumor tissue required a
signiﬁcantly lower dose h (median value of 417 nmol/L) than
cells from matched normal tissues (median of 764 nmol/L;
P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed rank test; Fig. 4D), in agreement
with other studies suggesting higher sensitivity of tumor
tissue to apoptotic agents (36, 37). This ﬁnding may be
consistent with the existence of a therapeutic window,
deﬁned as the difference in the predicted dose h between
tumor and matched normal tissue, which the model allowed
to be calculated for each patient individually (Supplementary
Fig. S3).
We then compared the model predicted dose h for all 18
patients with favorable outcome and unfavorable outcome
who received adjuvant 5-FU–based chemotherapy (Fig.
4E, Tables 1 and 2), as well as for all 26 patients, irrespective
of whether or not they received chemotherapy after surgery
(Fig. 4F). Of note, patients with 4-year disease-free survival
were predicted to be more responsive to chemotherapeutic
stimuli, as, indicated by the lower amount dose h, they required
for MOMP (median of 191 vs. 566 nmol/L of dose h, respectively;
P ¼ 0.0441, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; Fig. 4E). Moreover,
patients with overall favorable outcome also tended to be less
resistant to stress-induced BH3-only protein induction than
those with unfavorable outcome (median of 216 vs. 581 nmol/L
of dose h, respectively; P ¼ 0.0523, Wilcoxon rank-sum
test; Fig. 4F).
We reckoned that a protein dose of 300 nmol/L may be a
good separator to distinguish between patients with favorable

Figure 4. DR_MOMP can be used as predictor of clinical success in patients with CRCs. A, representative Western blot for BAX, BCL(X)L, MCL1, BAK, and
BCL2 in tumor and matched normal tissue from patients with CRCs alongside the HeLa control. B and C, the given BCL2 family proteins were quantiﬁed in
matched normal tissue (B) and tumor tissue (C) in 26 patients with stage II and III CRCs by quantitative Western blotting. D, model predicted BH3-only
stress dose h required for MOMP was calculated for patient matched normal and tumor tissue. Matches are indicated by solid lines. Tumor tissue (right box
plot) was predicted to require less dose h than the matched normal tissue (left box plot), consistent with the notion of cancer cells being primed to death
(36, 37). Wilcoxon signed rank test conﬁrmed signiﬁcance between both groups (P < 0.0001). E and F, the calculated dose h can distinguish patients
with favorable and unfavorable clinical outcome. Tumor tissue of 18 patients (E) who received adjuvant 5-FU–based chemotherapy and all 26 patients (F) were
analyzed by the model. Patients were classiﬁed on the basis of disease-free survival within 4 years after surgery. Those patients with favorable clinical
outcome required a signiﬁcantly lower dose h than patients with unfavorable outcome. G and H, Kaplan–Meier curves of disease-free survival were generated
for patients where the model predicted necessary doses h < 0.3 mmol/L or 0.3 mmol/L. Patients who required doses h < 0.3 mmol/L for MOMP (solid line) had a
better outcome than those requiring doses h of 0.3 mmol/L (dashed line). Statistical independence of Kaplan–Meier curves between both groups were tested
by log-rank test for patients who received adjuvant 5-FU–based chemotherapy (G; P ¼ 0.0099) and for all patients (H; P ¼ 0.0169).

or unfavorable outcome, as this dose lies in the middle of the
medians of each group and, therefore, provided the optimal
trade-off between speciﬁcity and sensitivity. Using this
separator, Kaplan–Meier analysis of disease-free survival
showed that patients with a predicted h < 300 nmol/L had a
signiﬁcantly longer survival than patients with h  300 nmol/L
(P ¼ 0.0099 for prediction of response to chemotherapy; Fig.
4G; P ¼ 0.0169, for overall outcome, Fig. 4H; log-rank test).
Collectively, these results suggested that the increased sensi-

tivity of tumor tissue compared with nontransformed cells may
sufﬁciently be explained by differences in intra-individual
protein proﬁles and that the modeled BH3-only stress dose h
required for MOMP may be used as a prognostic marker and
predictor of treatment responses to adjuvant chemotherapy.
To indicate the potential of our model in aiding of dose
response decisions for designing patient individual chemotherapy doses, we named the model dose response medicinal
outcome model predictor (DR_MOMP).

Figure 5. DR_MOMP as a tool to assess apoptosis sensitizers. Administration of either of the BH3-only mimetics ABT-737 or ApoG2 lowered the required dose
h for chemotherapy. ApoG2 or ABT-737 was modeled to be administered over 12 hours. A, with increased ABT-737 concentrations, HT-29 cells
became increasingly sensitized to treatment with 30 mg/mL 5-FU and 10 mg/mL oxaliplatin as observed by Annexin V/PI staining and subsequent ﬂow
cytometric analysis. This increased sensitivity was explained by DR_MOMP by a lower dose h. B and C, dose h was calculated for tumor tissue of the patients
in Fig. 4. B, total administration of 1 mmol/L ABT-737 or ApoG2 within 12 hours decreased the necessary median dose h in tumor samples from patients
(n ¼ 26) from 417 nmol/L (Fig. 4D) to 109 (with ApoG2) or 126 nmol/L (with ABT-737). Administration of a higher dose of 2.5 mmol/L of both drugs
did not markedly overall decrease the required dose for chemotherapy for all patients but decreased the variability in required dose between patients.
C, DR_MOMP allowed assessment of patients with a different response to BH3-mimetics. As an example, in tumor tissue of patient 23, ABT-737 (solid line)
reduced more signiﬁcantly than ApoG2 (dashed dotted line).

DR_MOMP can be used as a tool for adjuvant and
personalized therapies
BH3-mimetics are agents that are currently in clinical trial
for adjuvant chemotherapy and sensitize cancer cells to apoptosis by mimicking the BH3 domain of BH3-only proteins (38).
The synthetic drug ABT-737 (28) derepresses BH3-only activators by binding to BCL2 and BCL(X)L, whereas ApoG2 (29),
albeit potentially also acting on glucose metabolism (39),
sensitizes cells to apoptosis by binding to BCL2 and MCL1
(40). We implemented the molecular interactions governed by
these drugs into DR_MOMP and carried out ﬂow cytometric
experiments of HT-29 cells treated with 5-FU/oxaliplatin in the
absence or presence of ABT-737. Our results conﬁrmed that
ABT-737 increased the susceptibility of the cell populations to
cell death in a dose-dependent manner. This increased susceptibility can be explained by DR_MOMP through a decreased
dose h required for MOMP, suggesting that a lower dose of
chemotherapy is required with increased ABT-737 concentrations (Fig. 5A).
We next investigated the effects of either ABT-737 or ApoG2
in individual patients. We modeled these administrations to
lead to a total concentration of 1 or of 2.5 mmol/L of the
respective drug over 12 hours (41) in the presence of 5-FU/
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy and again calculated the dose

526

h that was required for MOMP in the patient tumor tissue. The
median of dose h was reduced when both ABT-737 (from 417 to
126 nmol/L for 1 mmol/L and to 58 nmol/L for 2.5 mmol/L) and
ApoG2 (to 109 and 58 nmol/L for 1 and 2.5 mmol/L) were
applied (Fig. 5B). In both cases, we observed not only a
decreased patient variability of the dose h with higher drug
concentrations but also interindividual difference in the predicted responses to these 2 agents (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
Here, we investigated how the interactions of BCL2 family
proteins translate different doses of chemotherapeutic stress
into the all-or-none decision of MOMP. We established a model
predictor acting as a surrogate for the chemotherapeutic dose
required to induce cell death in tumor and matched normal
tissues of individual patients. This model predictor correlated
with the susceptibility of different cancer cell populations to
stress, suggesting that cancer cells require less chemotherapeutic stress than nontransformed cells of the same patient
(36, 37) and even was able to identify patients with favorable or
unfavorable clinical outcome. Despite assuming that all tissues
in all patients were unimpaired in expressing BH3-only proteins in response to chemotherapy, DR_MOMP robustly predicted patient outcome.

BCL2 Systems Models and Colorectal Cancer

DR_MOMP may aid in predicting the optimal dose of chemotherapy that preserves healthy, normal tissue while killing
cancer cells and predicting which patients respond to classical
chemotherapy. It may also predict which patients may beneﬁt
from the addition of BH3-mimetics such as navitoclax (ABT263), ABT-737, ApoG2, AT-101, or obatoclax, which are currently preclinically and clinically tested (38). We applied
DR_MOMP to identify, in individual patients, how such
mimetics may restore apoptosis by lowering the necessary
dose of state-of-the-art chemotherapy. DR_MOMP suggested
that the predicted effects of BH3-mimetics were patient speciﬁc. As patient heterogeneity is often a reason for failure in
clinical trials (42, 43), DR_MOMP offers a possibility for in silico
analysis of individual protein ﬁngerprints from patients before
administration of BH3-mimetics. As all mimetics target different protein interactions and as protein levels that mediate
these interactions are patient speciﬁc, DR_MOMP may be able
to predict the most suitable co-treatment, both in terms of type
and concentration and may assist as an in silico tool in future
phase II and III clinical trials. Our modeling also suggested that
with sufﬁcient concentrations of BH3-mimetics, the interindividual variability in predicted responses was signiﬁcantly
attenuated, indicating the potential of BH3-mimetics potential
as future ﬁrst-line treatment paradigms.
Input to DR_MOMP required absolute protein quantiﬁcations. We used quantitative Western blotting as opposed to
alternatives such as ELISA as it allowed us to measure the
signal of the protein of interest at its speciﬁc band and
minimize the error due to unspeciﬁc antibody binding. However, for future clinical applications, array-based techniques
such as reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA; ref. 44) may
provide a cost-effective and accurate alternative for higher
numbers of proteins or specimens.
We have recently also developed a computational systems
model to investigate apoptosis signaling subsequent to MOMP
(14, 18) and showed that cancer cells have a decreased likelihood to undergo caspase activation than matched normal
tissue (16, 18). Indeed, it is well established that caspaseinhibitory proteins such as X-linked inhibitor of apoptotic
protein (XIAP) are overexpressed in cancer (45) and that
caspase-activating proteins are inactivated through promoter
methylation, chaperone binding, or phosphorylation (46). How
can these results be reconciled with the present study? A higher
"cancer cell sensitivity" to MOMP may indeed be associated
with higher ability of cancer cells to adapt and respond to
changes in their microenvironment, such as hypoxia/ischemia,
reactive oxygen species production, and oncogene signaling.
Cancer cells may accumulate tonic proapoptotic stimuli with-

out committing MOMP and therefore require less chemotherapy to be "pushed over the edge." However, with MOMP as a
potential all-or-none process, any information on dosage of
genotoxic stress inducing chemotherapy and potentially any
mitochondrial priming is likely to be lost after MOMP. Once a
sufﬁcient amount of stress is applied to induce MOMP, the
decision whether or not apoptosis is executed may then depend
on the expression levels of subsequent pro- and antiapoptotic
players and potentially on bioenergetic parameters involved in
this downstream process (14, 18, 47). It is therefore likely that
through the analysis of both pathways independently, complementary model predictors for cancer cell survival or death can
be established relating either to a dose-sensitive priming
upstream to MOMP, or to a dose-independent, binary decision
to evade of apoptosis execution downstream to MOMP.
