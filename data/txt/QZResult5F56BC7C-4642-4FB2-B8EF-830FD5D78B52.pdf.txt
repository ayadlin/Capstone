ABSTRACT
Diabetes mellitus and pancreatic cancer are intimately related, as approximately
85% of pancreatic cancer patients suffer from glucose intolerance or even diabetes. In
this study, we evaluate the underlying mechanism by which hyperglycemia modulates the
invasive potential of cancer cells and contributes to their enhanced metastatic behavior.
Here we show that hyperglycemia increases the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration
through up-regulation of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) expression, which
further activates the ERK and p38 MAPK pathways, as well as the transcription factors
NF-κB and AP-1, in a time-dependent manner. The invasion of pancreatic cancer cells
resulting from the activation of the H2O2/MAPK axis under high glucose conditions is
effectively inhibited by PD 98059 (ERK inhibitor), SB 203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor),
polyethylene glycol-conjugated catalase (PEG-CAT), or the siRNA specific to SOD2. In
addition, streptozotocin-treated diabetic nude mice exhibit a stronger tumor invasive
ability in renal capsule xenografts which could be suppressed by PEG-CAT treatment.
Furthermore, the integrated optical density (IOD) of SOD2 and uPA stainings is
higher in the tumor tissues of pancreatic cancer patients with diabetes compared with
pancreatic cancer patients with euglycemia. Taken together, our results demonstrate
that hyperglycemia enhances cell invasive ability through the SOD2/H2O2/MAPK axis
in human pancreatic cancer. Thus, SOD2/H2O2/MAPK axis may represent a promising
therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer patients combined with diabetes mellitus.

cancer that occurs before the operation [3]. Current treatments
for inoperable patients are still limited to chemotherapy,
radiation, or both [4]. Thus, more comprehensive and
constructive therapeutic strategies are urgently needed.
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common
non-communicable diseases worldwide and it is likely the
third modifiable risk factor for PC, after cigarette smoking
and obesity [5]. Approximately 85% of patients diagnosed
with PC have impaired glucose tolerance or even DM [6].
Clinical data have clearly indicated that patients with DM
can aggravate the progression of PC. Patients with DM

INTRODUCTION
As the fourth leading cause of cancer death worldwide,
pancreatic cancer (PC) is an aggressive malignant disease
with dismal prognosis, partially due to the lack of early
diagnosis and treatment options [1]. Although surgery
remains the only way to cure this severe disease, more than
80% of patients cannot be considered for surgical resection
at the time of initial diagnosis [2]. Even seemingly resectable
PC often fails to be cured due to the systemic spread of the

exhibit larger tumor sizes (>3 cm) and the existence of
DM was reported to be independently associated with a
reduced median survival [7]. Preoperative DM decreased
both the rates of disease-free survival and overall survival
for patients undergoing resection for PC [8]. Our own study
demonstrated that DM enhances perineural invasion in PC
patients and aggravates a poor prognosis [9]. However,
little is known about the specific mechanism regarding the
relationship between PC progression and DM.
Hyperglycemia, a typical characteristic of DM,
not only induces the overproduction of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), but also modulates anti-oxidative
mechanisms, contributing to a pro-oxidant state [10–11].
ROS consists of a number of chemically reactive
molecules derived from oxygen, including hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2). As a double-edged sword, excess
ROS production can kill cancer cells, whereas sublethal
concentrations of ROS can stimulate tumor progression
by promoting cell proliferation, survival, invasion
and metastasis [12]. Our previous studies showed that
high glucose (HG) can be regarded as an accelerator to
increase cell proliferation through enhanced epidermal
growth factor (EGF)/EGFR signaling, and as a promoter
to enhance the invasive ability of PC cells [13–14]. We
reasoned that the effects of DM on PC may be attributed to
the induction of ROS [14]. The main antioxidant enzymes
include superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the cytosol (CuZnSOD, SOD1) and mitochondria (Mn-SOD, SOD2), which
converts superoxide anion (O2−) into H2O2, as well as
catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), which
catabolize H2O2 into water [15]. SOD can induce the
migration and invasion of cancer cells via its metabolic
product H2O2 [16–17]. Meanwhile, as an H2O2 scavenger,
catalase inhibits ROS-mediated tumor metastasis [12].
It has been known that ROS triggers the signaling
pathways (e.g., mitogen activated protein kinase [MAPK]
pathway) involved in cell migration and metastasis [18].
ROS activates members of the MAPK family including
the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun
NH-2 terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK, resulting in
regulation of the activities of transcription factors, such as
activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), which in turn modulate the expression of metastasisrelated factors, including matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs) and the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)
system. The consequence of ROS/MAPK activation finally
results in local tumor invasion and distant metastasis [19].
In the current study, we investigated the production
of H2O2 and the activities of the cellular antioxidant
enzymes in PC cells in response to HG treatments. We also
tested the hypothesis that H2O2 mediates hyperglycemiainduced activation of the MAPK signaling pathways and
regulates the invasive activity of PC cells. Our findings
may provide new insight into the molecular interaction
between HG levels and PC and reveal a novel therapeutic
strategy for PC patients who suffer from diabetes.

Effects of HG on H2O2 production and the
expression of antioxidant enzymes in PC cells
To explore the possible relationship between HG
and oxidative stress, we first examined the effects of HG
on H2O2 production in PC cells. Our results show that
the levels of H2O2 in BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells are upregulated in response to high glucose concentrations in
comparison to normal physiological glucose level (5.5
mM glucose) in both time-dependent and dose-dependent
manners. Additionally, the HG-induced change in H2O2
production was not attributable to the osmolarity effects
on the cancer cells because the addition of mannitol,
an osmosis regulator, did not affect the level of H2O2
(Figure 1A).
Next, the protein expressions and activities of
antioxidant enzymes in the PC cells exposed to HG were
evaluated using Western blot analysis and antioxidant
enzyme activity assay. As shown in Figure 1B, the protein
levels of SOD2 and CAT were up-regulated in response to
increasing concentrations of HG. However, the expression
of SOD1 and GPX protein levels was not influenced by
HG. Treatment with mannitol did not affect the expression
of the antioxidant enzymes. HG condition could also
influence the activity of the antioxidant enzymes SOD
and CAT, and this trend was consistent with the results
from the protein expression analysis (Figure 1C–1E). All
of the tested antioxidant enzymes exhibited cytoplasmic
localization in both the BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cancer cells
(Supplementary Figures S1).

SOD2 is involved in the HG-induced
up-regulation of H2O2 production
To further examine whether SOD2 could influence
H2O2 production under HG conditions, we used SOD2
siRNA to knock down SOD2 expression in both BxPC-3
and Panc-1cancer cells and then examined the H2O2 levels
(Figure 1F, 1G). Our results show that the increased H2O2
production of the PC cells in the presence of HG was
diminished when SOD2 was knocked down, indicating
that the HG-induced H2O2 level is dependent on SOD2
(Figure 1H).

HG activates the ERK and p38 MAPK signaling
pathways via the production of H2O2
To determine whether HG could influence the
activation of MAPK signaling pathways, we analyzed
the expression of ERK, p38 MAPK as well as the related
transcription factors using Western blot analysis. As shown
in Figure 2A, HG treatment induced the phosphorylation
of ERK and p38 MAPK, as well as the phosphorylation
of the transcription factors NF-κB and c-Jun, in a

phosphorylation levels of ERK and p38 MAPK were
detected after 1 h of stimulation with HG and remained at
high levels until 24 h, while the activation of p-NF-κB and
p-c-Jun began after 3 h of HG stimulation.
To investigate whether the activation of the MAPK
signaling pathway was related with the production of
H2O2, we directly treated BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cancer
cells with H2O2. To determine the best intervention

BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells in media containing increasing
concentrations (0 – 800 μM) of H2O2 and the effects on
cell proliferation were determined using an MTT assay.
The results show that H2O2 induces cell proliferation
in BxPC-3 cells in a dose-dependent manner after
incubation for 24, 48, or 72 h with 0 to 200 μM H2O2;
however, H2O2 was cytotoxic at concentrations above
200 μM. A similar effect of H2O2 was also observed in

Therefore, a treatment concentration of 200 μM H2O2
was used in the subsequent experiments. As shown in
Figure 2B, H2O2 activated ERK and p38 MAPK in a

time-dependent manner, with peak activation between
5 and 15 min. Meanwhile, H2O2 treatment also led to
an increase in the phosphorylation level of NF-κB and
c-Jun, with a peak between 15 and 30 min.

We next treated both BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells
with the ERK inhibitor, PD 98059, or the p38 MAPK
inhibitor, SB 203580, and tested for the best intervention
concentrations. The results demonstrate that both inhibitors
suppress cells’ proliferation in a concentration-dependent
manner in both cell lines. For cells under treatment for
72 h, the IC50 of PD 98059 in both PC cell lines was
approximately 50 μM, whereas the IC50 of SB 203580
in BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cancer cells was approximately
20 μM (Supplementary Figure S2B, S2C). To further assess
whether the HG-induced H2O2 production was involved in
the MAPK activation, PC cells were treated with both HG
and polyethylene glycol-conjugated catalase (PEG-CAT),
which is able to prolong the circulatory half-life of the
native CAT enzyme and enhances its intracellular access.
Interestingly, we found that PEG-CAT diminished the HGinduced ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Figure 2C).
Treating the PC cells with PEG-CAT and PD 98059 or SB
203580 also diminished the phosphorylation levels of NFκB and c-Jun, indicating that H2O2 and the MAPK signaling
pathway mediates the activation of these transcription
factors (Figure 2D). Furthermore, as shown in Figure 2E,
the phosphorylation levels of ERK and p38 MAPK were
significantly decreased following SOD2 knockdown,
indicating that the SOD2-induced H2O2 level is intimately
related to the MAPK pathway. The phosphorylation levels
of NF-κB and c-Jun were also diminished in the si-SOD2
group (Figure 2F).

treated with H2O2, PEG-CAT, and si-SOD2, and the
invasive abilities of the cells were examined under
different glucose conditions. The results show that both
HG and H2O2 increased the invasion rates of cancer cells.
HG-induced cell invasion decreased when H2O2 was
eliminated by either PEG-CAT or si-SOD2 treatment
(Figure 4). Furthermore, both PD 98059 and SB 203580
could decrease PC cells invasion under HG conditions,
indicating that the activation of the ERK and p38 MAPK
signaling pathways is involved in HG-induced PC cell
invasion (Figure 5).

PEG-CAT inhibits tumor invasion in
streptozotocin (STZ)-treated nude mice
To determine the efficacy of different drugs against
transplantation-established human tumor xenografts in the
athymic nude mice, we used a subrenal capsular assay.
STZ is a chemical which is commonly used to induce
experimental diabetes in animals [20]. The characteristics
of the STZ-treated nude mice used in this study were
summarized in Figure 6. The fasting blood glucose levels
were significantly increased from 2 weeks to 4 weeks
after STZ injection (Figure 6A) and the body weight of
the nude mice was reduced at 4 weeks after STZ injection
(Figure 6B).
In the subrenal capsular assay, cancer cells were
maintained in a discrete, solid structure under the
kidney capsule and were able to invade into the kidney
parenchyma, identified by detection of the tumor cells
surrounding renal glomeruli and tubules. As shown by the
H&E staining results in Figure 6C, the invasive ability of
both the BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells were strongly enhanced
in the DM renal capsule xenograft model and this increase
could be suppressed by PEG-CAT treatment. Taken
together, these results indicate that the hyperglycemiainduced increase of the level of H2O2 is involved in the
acceleration of tumor invasion.

H2O2 production is required for the HG-induced
up-regulation of uPA
Our previous study demonstrated that HG could
promote the invasive ability of PC cells through the upregulation of the metastasis-related factor uPA [14]. To
examine whether the HG-induced uPA expression is
related to the H2O2 level, H2O2, PEG-CAT and si-SOD2
were used to test the expression of uPA. As illustrated
in Figure 3, the expression of uPA that is located in the
cytoplasm (Figure 3A), was increased following the
addition of H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
3B). PEG-CAT cleared the produced H2O2, and si-SOD2
decreased the production of H2O2, both of PEG-CAT and
si-SOD2 down-regulated the expression of uPA under HG
conditions in PC cells (Figure 3C, 3D). In addition, both
PD 98059 and SB 203580 could decrease the expression
of uPA in PC cells under HG conditions, indicating that the
activation of the ERK and p38 MAPK signaling pathway
is involved in HG-induced uPA expression (Figure 3E).

pancreatic ductal carcinoma specimens
Of all 417 cases, 149 (35.73%) had hyperglycemia
(new-onset diabetes and uncontrolled diabetes). The
remaining 268 cases (euglycemia group) included
controlled diabetic or non-diabetic cases. The
hyperglycemia and euglycemia groups were similar in
terms of age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Among
the 149 hyperglycemia cases, 47 had a history of diabetes,
compared with 14 of 268 euglycemia cases (P < 0.001,
Chi-square test).
We further investigated the change in the
expression levels of the SOD and uPA in human PC
specimen in the euglycemia and hyperglycemia groups.
As shown in Figure 7, the majority of SOD1, SOD2,
and uPA staining was located at the cytoplasm. There is

of the most lethal malignant diseases. In recent years,
although the largest improvements in survival have been
made for a number of other cancers, PC still shows the least
improvement [1]. It has been estimated that the mortality
rates of cancers of the lung, colon, breast and prostate
will decline due to the combined effects of widespread
screening, smoking cessation and more effective therapy,
and PC may become the leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in the USA by 2050 [21]. Therefore, the exploration
of risk factors, metastatic mechanisms and therapeutic
targets for PC has become hot topics in recent years.
DM, which is a very common metabolic disorder
characterized by hyperglycemia that eventually affects
all of the systems in the body, has been postulated to be
both an independent risk factor and a consequence for
PC in recent years [22]. On one hand, a large number
of epidemiological studies have demonstrated that DM
increases an individual’s risk of developing PC [23] and
anti-diabetic drugs can be used to prevent and treat PC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[24]. On the other hand, DM may be a consequence of
PC because there is an increased prevalence of diabetes
in PC patients and DM may be resolved after surgery
(pancreaticoduodenectomy) [25]. However, little is known
about the specific mechanism underlying this linkage.
Our data show that the hyperglycemia-induced
invasive ability of PC cells could be attributed to the
production of ROS. There are 6 major pathways that
contribute to the production of ROS under HG conditions:
glyceraldehyde autoxidation, PKC activation, glycation,
sorbitol metabolism, the hexosamine pathway, and
oxidative phosphorylation [26]. ROS can be considered
as a double-edged sword in cancer cells; excess ROS
production can kill cells, whereas sublethal concentrations
of ROS can promote cell progression [12]. Our results
indicate that high glucose resulted in an increase in the
level of H2O2 to a non-toxic level in PC cells; treatment
with H2O2 promoted cancer cell proliferation when its
concentration was below 200 μM, but H2O2 concentrations

above 200 μM were toxic to the cancer cells. Recently,
Ikemura et al. [27] showed that there were larger and
more tumor metastatic colonies in the lung and liver of
the STZ-treated mice and injections of PEG-CAT could
effectively inhibit tumor metastasis. They concluded that
the increased oxidative stress, not a high blood glucose
level, could accelerate tumor metastasis in hyperglycemic
mice. Additionally, the hyperglycemia-induced increase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in ROS also resulted in the up-regulation of adhesion
molecules expression, through which tumor cells adhere
to endothelial cells to form metastatic colonies [28–29].
H2O2 is diffusible and thus capable of traveling across
plasma membranes into the extracellular space to exert
both paracrine and autocrine roles. In our in vitro study,
we observed that H2O2 could increase the invasive ability
of the PC cells, whereas treatment with either PEG-CAT,

which cleared the produced H2O2, or si-SOD2, which
decreased the production of H2O2, could terminate this
effect. Additionally, in our in vivo study, we demonstrated
that a single injection of STZ could lead to a reduction
in body weight and an increase in the fasting blood
glucose level of nude mouse. Hyperglycemic conditions
enhanced the invasive ability of both BxPC-3 and Panc-1
cells in renal capsule xenografts and this effect might be
attributed to the production of H2O2, as injection of PEGCAT effectively inhibited tumor invasion in the STZtreated mice. In addition, hyperglycemia is correlated with
increased expression levels of SOD2 and uPA in the tissue
specimens obtained from PC patients. As our previous
study demonstrated that DM enhances perineural invasion
in PC patients [9], we assumed that this enhancement
might be related with HG-induced H2O2 production.
Cellular SOD converts intracellular superoxide
radicals into H2O2 that is cleared by GPX and CAT and
converted into water. It has been shown that the SOD activity
was much higher in both diabetic patients [30–31] and STZtreated/alloxan-induced diabetic mice compared to those
with normal blood glucose [20, 32]. SODs are a family of
antioxidant enzymes responsible for the detoxification of
superoxide anion. SOD1 is located in the cytoplasm, while
SOD2 is in the mitochondria [15]. In the current study, we
found that HG increases SOD2, but not SOD1 expression,
which might indicate that hyperglycemia preferentially
affect H2O2 production in mitochondria. In addition, we
also showed that SOD-induced H2O2 production promoted
tumor cell invasion; while si-SOD2 and PEG-CAT treatment
inhibits these effects. In recent years, increased SOD2 levels
have been associated with poor prognosis and resistance
to therapy of several tumors in the central nervous system,
gastrointestinal tract, head and neck [33]. Toh et al. [34]
reported 2.19- and 3.72-fold increases in SOD2 mRNA
expression relative to normal tissue in gastric and colorectal
cancers, respectively. Lewis et al. [35] indicated that nude
mice that were injected with human PC cells occasionally
developed intra-abdominal metastatic deposits and ascites
that were associated with an increase in SOD2 activity. The
A allele of the SOD2 − 1221G > A genotype was associated
with a higher risk of pancreatic cancer among individuals
with a low dietary vitamin E intake [36]. However, there
are also many reports that SOD2 has characteristics of
tumor suppressor and can inhibit cancer development and
progression [37]. Hempel et al. [38] concluded that there is a
dichotomous role for SOD2 during tumorigenisis. SOD2 may
act as a tumor suppressor during the initial onset/proliferative
stage of tumor initiation, yet once the tumor progresses to
a more aggressive and invasive phenotype, SOD2 levels
appear to positively correlate and contribute to enhanced
metastatic behavior of cancer cells. Our results support the
concept that metastatic disease is associated with changes
in the content and activity of the antioxidant enzymes [35].
Additionally, In agreement with other reports [31–39], the
activity of CAT was also found to be slightly increased
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

under HG conditions. This may be attributed to the fact that
persistent hyperglycemia leads to increased H2O2 levels,
which eventually results in the induction of CAT activity.
The MAPK signaling pathways are important signaling
cascades downstream of ROS that are involved in tumor
migration and invasion [18]. Cheng et al. [40] observed
that H2O2 is a mediator of the epidermal growth factor
(EGF)-mediated activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and
cell invasion in ovarian cancer cells. Lee et al. [41] also
showed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) regulates H2O2
production which further activates the ERK pathway and
regulates uPA production, eventually increasing the invasive
potential of stomach cancer cells. Our results show that HG
could promote the activation of p-ERK, p-p38, p-NF-κB and
p-c-Jun via H2O2. After suppressing the MAPK signaling
pathway by treatment with PD 98059 or SB 203580, the
invasive ability of PC cells decreased. Additionally, the
down-regulation of H2O2 by either PEG-CAT or si-SOD2
inhibits the activation of the MAPK signaling pathways and
tumor invasion, which indicates that H2O2 is the key factor
that mediated HG-induced PC metastasis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study protocol and consent forms conform
to the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by
the Ethical Review Board (ERB) Committee (The First
Affiliated Hospital of Medical College, Xi’an Jiaotong
University, China) and the written informed consent was
obtained from all participants.

Collection of tissues and immunohistochemistry
From January 2007 to July 2014, 520 pancreatic
tumors were subjected to clinical examination at the First
Affiliated Hospital, Xi’an Jiaotong University, China.
Among them, 417 cases were diagnosed with pancreatic
ductal carcinoma excluding islet cell carcinoma, intraductal
papillary mucinous tumor and acinar cell carcinoma.
The 417 pancreatic tumors were divided into two groups
according to their fasting blood glucose levels (an average
long-term glucose level for patients with a history of
diabetes mellitus and an average three-day glucose level
after hospitalization): (1) euglycemia or normal (no diabetic
or controlled diabetic cases) and (2) hyperglycemia or high
(new-onset diabetes and uncontrolled diabetes). Most PC
patients were diagnosed at the advanced-stage and not
suitable for surgical resection. Therefore, only sixty-five
patients who received a radical curative pancreatic operation
with a pathologic diagnosis and 8 normal pancreases
(also from the First Affiliated Hospital, Xi’an Jiaotong
University) were included in this study. Formalin fixed and
paraffin embedded PC tissue samples from the above fiftynine patients were used for the immunohistochemistry test.
The tissue sections were incubated with primary
antibodies (anti-SOD1, anti-SOD2 and anti-uPA, 1:50)

overnight at 4°C and incubated with the appropriate
biotinylated secondary antibody for 30 min at room
temperature. After rinsing, the results were visualized
using diaminobenzidine (DAB) and the slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin. The densitometry
analysis of immunohistochemical staining was performed
using the Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software.

catalyzed by peroxidase to generate the red product
that could be detected using a microplate reader at
a wavelength of 520 nm. Catalase activity was then
calculated from the assay results.
The activity of GPX was examined using a total
glutathione peroxidase assay kit (Beyotime, Jinan, China).
Briefly, GPX was indirectly measured by evaluating the level
of NADPH oxidation in a coupled assay system, containing
glutathione, glutathione reductase and cumene hydroperoxide
as the substrate, using a microplate reader at a wavelength of
340 nm. GPX (1 unit) was defined as the amount of enzyme
that oxidized 1 nmol of NADPH in one minute.

Cell culture and reagents
The human PC cell lines, BxPC-3 and Panc-1, were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% dialyzed heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/
ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 95% air/5%
CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37°C. Catalase derivative
conjugated to polyethylene glycol (PEG-catalase) and
streptozotocin (STZ) were acquired from Sigma Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). The ERK inhibitor PD 98059 and
the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 were obtained from
Sigma Chemical Co. Primary antibodies against SOD1,
SOD2, CAT, GPX1 and uPA were procured from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The antiERK, anti-phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-p38
MAPK, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), antiNF-κB, anti-phospho-NF-κB p65 (Ser468), anti-c-Jun and
anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser63) antibodies were obtained from
Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA).

MTT assay
BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates at a density of 5,000 to 10,000 cells per well and
were incubated overnight in medium containing 10% FBS.
The cells were then treated with increasing concentrations
of PD 98059, SB 203580, or H2O2. After incubation for
24, 48, or 72 h at 37°C, the MTT reagent was added to
each well and was incubated at 37°C for 4 h. DMSO was
then added to each well and the optical density (OD) value
at 490 nm was determined using a spectrophotometer
(Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The results are presented as the
percentages relative to the controls. The proliferation rate
was defined as = ODsample/ODcontrol × 100%.

Transwell matrigel invasion assay
The invasive ability of the PC cells was analyzed
using matrigel invasion chambers. The 8.0 μm pore inserts
were coated with 30 μl of matrigel. Cell suspensions
(5 × 104) were added to the upper chambers in DMEM
containing 1% FBS. 500 μl of DMEM containing 20% FBS
was placed in the lower chambers. The matrigel invasion
chamber was then incubated for 48 h in a humidified tissue
culture incubator. The non-invading cells were removed
from the upper surface by scraping with a wet cotton swab.
After rinsing with PBS, the filter was fixed and stained
with crystal violet. The invasion ability was determined by
counting the stained cells on the bottom surface.

Hydrogen peroxide assay
The level of intracellular H2O2 was measured using
hydrogen peroxide assay kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. In this kit, the ferrous ions Fe2+ were oxidized
to ferric ions Fe3+ by H2O2. The ferric ions further formed
a complex with the indicator dye xylenol orange and
produced a visible purple-colored complex that could then
be measured using a microplate reader at a wavelength of
560–590 nm (Bio-Rad, CA, USA).

Antioxidant enzyme activities
The bioactivity of SOD was measured using a
total SOD activity assay kit (Beyotime, Jinan, China).
This assay is based on the ability of SOD to inhibit the
formation of water-soluble formazan dye that results from
the reaction between superoxide anion and WST-1. The
absorbance at a wavelength of 450 nm was measured
using a microplate reader. The activity of total SOD was
calculated according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The CAT activity was detected using a catalase
analysis kit (Beyotime, Jinan, China). Briefly, the
cell lysates were treated with excess H2O2 that was
decomposed by CAT for the indicated times. Afterwards,
the remaining H2O2 was coupled to a substrate and was

Real-time quantitative PCR (QT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from the PC cells using
the Fastgen200 RNA isolation system (Fastgen, Shanghai,
China). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA
using the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian,
China). The PCR reactions consisted of 30 s at 95°C,
followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s, 60°C for 30 s and
72°C for 30 s. The relative gene expression was calculated
using the previously described 2-ΔΔCt method [42]. The
primer sequences were as follows:
SOD2-F: 5′-CAC CAC AGC AAG CAC CAC-3′.
SOD2-R: 5′-GTT CTC CAC CAC CGT TAG G-3′.

The left renal capsule, as well as the xenografts,
were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and were
processed in paraffin. Sections were cut using a microtome
and were mounted on glass slides. After dewaxing, the
sections were hydrated in graded alcoholic solutions and
distilled water. Routine H&E staining was performed.

Western blot analysis

Statistical analysis

Proteins were electrophoretically resolved on a
denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel and were electro­
transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The
membranes were initially blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk
in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 2 h and then probed with
each primary antibody. After co-incubation with the primary
antibodies at 4°C overnight, the membranes were blotted
with the secondary antibody for 2 h at 37°C. The results
were visualized using the ECL Western blotting substrate
and were photographed by GeneBox (SynGene).

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
software (version 17.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). Data
were presented as the means ± SEM of three replicate
assays. Differences between the groups were analyzed
by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance
was set at P < 0.05. All experiments were repeated
independently at least three times.

CONCLUSION
The current study demonstrates that H2O2 contributes
to the SOD2-induced invasion in PC cells in vitro by
modulating the expression of the metastasis-related factor
uPA through the activation of the ERK and p38 MAPK
signaling pathways. This study also provides evidence
that accelerated tumor invasion in hyperglycemic nude
mice is due to the increased production of H2O2, which
can be effectively inhibited by repeated injections of
PEG-CAT. In addition, hyperglycemia is correlated with
increased expression levels of SOD2 and uPA in the tissue
specimens obtained from PC patients. These findings
suggest that blocking the SOD2/H2O2/MAPK signaling
system may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of
PC accompanied by DM.

RNAi transfections
siRNA against SOD2 (SOD2-Homo-429: 5′-GGU
GGU CAU AUC AAU CAU ATT-3′, 5′-UAU GAU
UGA UAU GAC CAC CTT-3′) and a negative control
siRNA (NC: 5′-UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG UTT3′, 5′-ACG UGA CAC GUU CGG AGA ATT-3′) were
purchased from GenePharm (Shanghai, China).

Subrenal capsular assay and histopathology
Five week old BALB/c athymic nude mice were
purchased from Shanghai Experimental Animal Center.
Animal care and experiments were carried out in accordance
with the guidelines of Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at Xi’an Jiaotong University. For DM group,
BALB/c athymic nude mice received an intraperitoneal
injection of STZ at a dose of 175 mg/kg body weight.
The subrenal capsular assay, a rapid in vivo test
system for observing tumor proliferation and invasion, was
established to test the efficacy of different drugs against
transplantation-established human tumor xenografts in the
athymic nude mice (n ≥ 6 for each group).
Two weeks after STZ injection, each mouse was used
for the subrenal capsule assay. The BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cell
lines were used to create xenografts in the athymic nude
mice. After anesthetization, the left kidney of each mouse was
exposed and the same number of cells (1 × 108) was injected
under the left renal capsule in a total volume of 25 (l. Three
days later, PEG-CAT was intraperitoneally injected into a
group of mice at a dose of 1000 units/d. The cells maintained
a discrete, solid structure under the kidney capsule, and
3-dimensional growth was observed microscopically and
directly quantified by changes in the average diameter. After
inoculation with the tumor cells, the mice were sacrificed on
day 14 and their left kidneys were excised.
