Abstract
Cancer cells are long known to exhibit increased aerobic glycolysis, but glycolytic inhibition has not offered a
viable chemotherapeutic strategy in part because of the systemic toxicity of antiglycolytic agents. However, recent
studies suggest that a combined inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial function may help overcome this issue.
In this study, we investigated the chemotherapeutic efﬁcacies of mitochondria-targeted drugs (MTD) in
combination with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a compound that inhibits glycolysis. Using the MTDs, termed
Mito-CP and Mito-Q, we evaluated relative cytotoxic effects and mitochondrial bioenergetic changes in vitro.
Interestingly, both Mito-CP and Mito-Q synergized with 2-DG to decrease ATP levels in two cell lines. However,
with time, the cellular bioenergetic function and clonogenic survival were largely restored in some cells. In a
xenograft model of human breast cancer, combined treatment of Mito-CP and 2-DG led to signiﬁcant tumor
regression in the absence of signiﬁcant morphologic changes in kidney, liver, or heart. Collectively, our ﬁndings
suggest that dual targeting of mitochondrial bioenergetic metabolism with MTDs and glycolytic inhibitors such as
2-DG may offer a promising chemotherapeutic strategy. Cancer Res; 72(10); 2634–44. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Emerging research in cancer chemotherapy is focused on
exploiting the biochemical differences between cancer cell and
normal cell metabolism (1, 2). One of the fundamental changes
that occurs in most malignant cancer cells is the shift in energy
metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis to generate ATP (the Warburg effect; refs. 3–5). Several
agents that speciﬁcally inhibit glycolytic metabolism have been
used as effective anticancer agents in cellular systems and in
animal models (5, 6). However, this approach has yielded fewer
positive results in human patients (with the exception of
imatinib), most likely due to dose-limiting side effects (e.g.,
neurotoxicity; ref. 7). One of the most frequently used antiglycolytic agents is 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), which is phosphorylated by hexokinase and subsequently inhibits ATP
generated via the glycolytic pathway (7, 8). However, high
concentrations (20 mmol/L) of 2-DG were typically used
to inhibit the glycolytic metabolism in cancer cells (9). 2-DG
is undergoing clinical trials for treatment of glioma and its

efﬁcacy is limited by the systemic toxicity (10). A recent
strategy to "hypersensitize" tumor cells involved the combined use of mitochondrial inhibitors (oligomycin and antimycin) or delocalized cationic compounds with 2-DG (11,
12). Dual targeting of mitochondrial and glycolytic pathways
was suggested as a promising chemotherapeutic strategy
(13, 14).
Recent work has revealed that cancer-promoting oncogenes
and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1a) also induce a glycolytic
shift (15, 16). Activation of oncogenic signaling pathways
involving PI3K/Akt/mTOR, c-Myc, Src, and Ras leads to
enhanced glucose uptake and high glycolytic activity mimicking the Warburg effect in cancer cells (17, 18). Thus, targeting of
both mitochondrial bioenergetic function and the glycolysis
pathway is an attractive experimental chemotherapeutic strategy. Previously, investigators have used agents (e.g., rhodamine-123, rotenone, antimycin, or oligomycin) that inhibit
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in combination with
glycolytic inhibitors to eradicate tumor cells (19). In contrast, a
similar treatment (rhodamine-123 and 2-DG) failed to elicit
cytotoxic effects in normal epithelial cells (20). The rationale
for this approach is that compromised oxidative phosphorylation in tumor cells leads to stimulation of glycolytic metabolism for ATP generation. Dichloroacetate (DCA), a pyruvate
mimetic that inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, shifts
cellular metabolism from glycolysis to OXPHOS (21, 22). However, DCA was selectively more toxic in cells with defective
mitochondrial electron transport chain (22, 23). As indicated
earlier, mitochondrial targeting of drugs combined with 2-DG
or other glycolytic inhibitors may be an extremely effective
strategy to eliminate slow growing hypoxic tumor cells present
in most solid tumors (12).

Selective Targeting of Metabolism in Breast Cancer

proxyl (CP), Me-TPPþ.

The accumulation of mitochondria-targeted delocalized
lipophilic cations such as Mito-CP (Fig. 1) in tumor cells is
controlled by several factors including the lipophilicity and the
chain length of mitochondria-targeted drugs (MTD), the negative mitochondrial membrane potential, and the levels of pglycoprotein-mediated MDR protein that actively pumps cationic drugs out of the tumor cells (24). Recent research showed
that Mito-Q (coenzyme-Q conjugated to an alkyl triphenylphosphonium cation) and Mito-CP (a 5-membered nitroxide, CP,
conjugated to a TPPþ) potently inhibited proliferation of
breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) or human colon
cancer cells (HCT-116; refs. 25, 26). These MTDs did not
signiﬁcantly affect normal cell proliferation (25). In related
studies, we have shown that the MTDs effectively mitigated the
toxic side effects (cardiotoxicity or nephrotoxicity) induced by
conventional chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin or cisplatin (27). These results led us to postulate the following
hypothesis: The combined use of MTDs (Mito-CP and Mito-Q)
and 2-DG will synergistically enhance cytotoxicity selectively in
cancer cells compared with either drug alone. In this study, we
investigated the chemotherapeutic effects of 2-DG in combination with Mito-CP, Mito-Q, and other appropriate control
compounds. Results from this study indicate that targeting
mitochondria with small molecular weight antioxidants conjugated to an alkyl TPPþ and glycolytic inhibitors is a potentially promising and effective cancer treatment strategy.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
Mito-CP and Mito-Q were synthesized as previously published
(refs. 28, 29; see Fig. 1 for chemical structures). 2-DG, carboxyproxyl (CP), and methyl triphenylphosphonium (Me-TPPþ) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. D-Luciferin sodium salt was
obtained from Caliper Life Sciences, Inc. (1-Decyl) triphenylphosphonium bromide (Dec-TPPþ) was obtained from Alfa Aesar.
Cell culture
MCF-7, MCF-10A, and MDA-MB-231 cells were acquired in
the last 2 years from the American Type Culture Collection,

www.aacrjournals.org

where they are regularly authenticated. Cells were stored in
liquid nitrogen and used within 6 months after thawing. Cell
lines were grown at 37 C in 5% CO2. MCF-7 cells were maintained in MEM-a (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS, bovine
insulin (10 mg/mL), penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin
(100 mg/mL). MCF-10A cells were cultured in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM)/F12 media (1:1; Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% horse serum, bovine insulin
(10 mg/mL), epidermal growth factor (20 ng/mL), cholera
toxin (100 ng/mL), and hydrocortisone (0.5 mg/mL), penicillin
(100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 mg/mL). MDA-MB-231 cells
were cultured in DMEM, 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/mL), and
streptomycin (100 mg/mL). The MDA-MB-231-luc cell line
stably transfected with luciferase was cultured under the same
conditions as the MDA-MB-231 cells described above. These
cells were a kind gift from Dr. Michael B. Dwinell (Department
of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Medical College
of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI) and were recently described in
detail (30). They are regularly assessed for standard growth
characteristics and tumorigenicity in nude mice.
Extracellular ﬂux assay
The bioenergetic function of MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells in
response to Mito-CP or 2-DG was determined using a Seahorse
Bioscience XF24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience). MCF-7 or MCF-10A cells were seeded in specialized V7
Seahorse tissue culture plates. One hour before the start of the
experiment, cells were washed and changed to unbuffered
assay medium adjusted to pH 7.4, ﬁnal volume 675 mL
(MEM-a for MCF-7, DMEM/F12 for MCF-10A). After establishing the baseline oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidiﬁcation rate (ECAR), Mito-CP (1 mmol/L) or 2-DG
(5 mmol/L) were administered through an automated pneumatic injection port of XF24. The changes in OCR and ECAR
were monitored for 4 hours. The resulting effects on OCR and
ECAR are shown as a percentage of the baseline measurement
for each treatment.
To determine the mitochondrial and glycolytic function of
MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells in response to Mito-CP, Mito-Q, and
2-DG, we used the bioenergetic function assay previously
described with several modiﬁcations (31, 32). After seeding
and treatment as indicated, MCF-7 cells and MCF-10A cells
were washed with complete media and either assayed immediately or returned to a 37 C incubator for 36 or 60 hours. The
cells were then washed with unbuffered media as described
above. Five baseline OCR and ECAR measurements were then
taken before injection of oligomycin (1 mg/mL) to inhibit ATP
synthase, FCCP (1–3 mmol/L) to uncouple the mitochondria
and yield maximal OCR, and antimycin A (10 mmol/L) to
prevent mitochondrial oxygen consumption through inhibition of complex III. From these measurements, indices of
mitochondrial function were determined as previously
described (31, 32).
Intracellular ATP measurements
MCF-7, MCF-10A, and MDA-MB-231 cells seeded at 2  104
per well in 96-well plates were treated continuously with 2-DG
in the presence and absence of 1 mmol/L of the indicated MTDs

(Mito-CP or Mito-Q) or appropriate controls for 6 hours.
Intracellular ATP levels were determined in cell lysates using
a luciferase-based assay per manufacturer's instructions (Sigma Aldrich). Results were normalized to the total protein level
in cell lysate measured in each well determined by the Bradford
method (Bio-Rad).
Cell death and clonogenic assays
MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells seeded at 2  104 per well in 96well plates were treated with 2-DG in the presence and absence
of 1 mmol/L MTDs for 6 or 24 hours, and dead cells were
monitored by staining with Sytox Green per the manufacturer's
instructions (Invitrogen). Fluorescence intensities from cells
grown in 96-well plate were acquired using a plate reader
(Beckman Coulter DTX-880; Beckman-Coulter) equipped with
485 nm excitation and 535 nm emission ﬁlters. To measure the
total cell number, half of the samples in each treatment group
were permeabilized with digitonin (120 mmol/L) when staining
with Sytox Green and ﬂuorescence intensities in digitonintreated cells were taken as 100%. Data are represented as a
percentage of dead cells after normalization to total cell
number for each group.
For clonogenic assay, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-10A
cells were seeded at 300 cells per dish in 6-cm cell culture dishes
and treated with 2-DG in the presence and absence of 1 mmol/L
MTDs for 6 hours. After 7 to 14 days, the number of colonies
formed was counted. The cell survival fractions were calculated according to a published protocol (33).
Xenograft experiments
All protocols were approved by the Medical College of
Wisconsin Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
MDA-MB-231-luc cells [5  105 cells in 200 mL of a mixture
of 1:1 PBS/Matrigel (BD Biosciences)] were injected into
the right mammary fat-pad of 8-week-old female SHO mice
(Charles Rivers). Tumor establishment and growth were
monitored by injecting D-luciferin per manufacturer's
instructions (Caliper Life Sciences) and detecting bioluminescence using the Lumina IVIS-100 In Vivo Imaging System (Xenogen Corp.; ref. 30). The light intensities emitted
from regions of interest were expressed as total ﬂux
(photons/s).
Two days after injection of cells, the mice were imaged to
verify tumor establishment. Mice were then orally gavaged
with either water (control), Mito-CP (40 mg/kg), 2-DG (1 g/kg),
or a mixture of Mito-CP (40 mg/kg, ﬁnal concentration) and 2DG (1 g/kg, ﬁnal concentration) 5 times/wk (Monday through
Friday). This treatment protocol was selected based on recent
studies showing that Mito-CP is cleared from plasma of mice
within approximately 6 hours of injection (34). After 4 weeks of
treatment, the mice were sacriﬁced, and the tumor, kidney,
heart, and liver were removed and formalin ﬁxed. These tissues
were then parafﬁn embedded and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E).
Statistics
All results are expressed as mean  SEM. Comparisons
among groups of data were made using a one-way ANOVA with

Tukey post hoc analysis. P value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
Effects of Mito-CP or Mito-Q alone and in combination
with 2-DG on bioenergetic function in MCF-7 and MCF10A cells
The OCR and ECAR (as a surrogate marker for glycolysis)
were measured in a Seahorse Bioscience XF24 extracellular ﬂux
analyzer. The bioenergetic proﬁles obtained under various
experimental conditions following Mito-CP and 2-DG treatments were determined according to the procedures outlined
previously (31, 32). As shown in Fig. 2A and B, addition of MitoCP (1 mmol/L) greatly decreased the OCR in both MCF-7 and
MCF-10A cells. Notably, Mito-CP stimulated ECAR in both
MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells, signaling an increase in glycolysis
likely to compensate for the loss of OCR. As expected, 2-DG
(5 mmol/L) that inhibits glycolysis decreased the ECAR by 40%
(Fig. 2C and D). Under these conditions, individual treatment
with either Mito-CP or 2-DG slightly, but signiﬁcantly,
decreased the intracellular ATP levels in MCF-7 cells, but not
in MCF-10A cells (Fig. 2E and F).
The extent of relative increase in glycolytic activity after
treatment with Mito-CP (1 mmol/L) was notably higher in
MCF-10A cells as compared with MCF-7 cells. To identify the
source of the difference in ECAR stimulation between these cell
lines, we next examined the potential for glycolysis stimulation
in each cell line. ECAR was measured in MCF-7 cells cultured in
media containing 5.5 or 17.5 mmol/L glucose and in MCF-10A
cells cultured in media containing 17.5 mmol/L glucose (Supplementary Fig. S1A). After baseline ECAR was established,
oligomycin was injected to the indicated ﬁnal concentration.
Because oligomycin inhibits mitochondrial ATP production
and results in compensatory increases in glycolysis, the degree
to which ECAR is stimulated by oligomycin should correlate
with the cellular glycolytic potential. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1A, oligomycin caused a more robust stimulation of
ECAR in MCF-10A cells than MCF-7 cells, regardless of the
glucose concentration used to culture the MCF-7 cells. To
conﬁrm this and rule out other effects of culture media
differences, MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells were seeded as normal
into Seahorse Bioscience culture plates. One hour before the
start of the experiment, the media was changed in all wells to
a specialized DMEM-based assay media lacking glucose and
FBS. Baseline ECAR was measured and then glucose was
injected to a ﬁnal concentration of either 5.5 or 17.5 mmol/L
to match routine culture conditions for each cell type (Supplementary Fig. S1B). This resulted in a stimulation of ECAR
that was not signiﬁcantly different between cell types or
glucose concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S1B). Oligomycin was subsequently injected to a ﬁnal concentration of 1
mg/mL in all wells, and stimulation of ECAR was monitored.
MCF-10A cells had a signiﬁcantly greater stimulation of
ECAR than MCF-7 cells regardless of glucose concentration
(Supplementary Fig. S1B and C). Reversal of ECAR stimulation due to both glucose and oligomycin administration was
found to be dependent on glycolysis. Finally, 2-DG was

injected to a ﬁnal concentration of 25 mmol/L in all wells. 2DG–dependent inhibition indicates that glucose- and oligomycin-stimulated ECAR was reﬂecting cellular glycolytic
activity.
We next measured the intracellular ATP levels in MCF-7 and
MCF-10A cells treated with different concentrations of 2-DG in
the presence of Mito-CP (1 mmol/L) and other control compounds (CP, TPPþ, and Dec-TPPþ). As shown in Fig. 3A, MitoCP and 2-DG together decreased the intracellular ATP levels in
MCF-7 cells by 20% to 30% more than in MCF-10A cells.
Treatment with Mito-Q or with TPPþ conjugated to a longchain aliphatic hydrocarbon (Dec-TPPþ) and 2-DG enhanced
ATP depletion in both cell lines (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig.
S2). In contrast to Mito-CP, treatment with CP or Me-TPPþ and
varying levels of 2-DG did not cause enhanced intracellular
ATP depletion (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). Similar results
were observed in another breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and B). Notably, the enhancement of
ATP depletion is not related to the delocalized cation only, as
Me-TPPþ did not sensitize the cells to 2-DG (Supplementary
Fig. S2). These results indicated that MTDs (Mito-CP and MitoQ) with an antioxidant moiety (nitroxide group and Co-Q)
conjugated to the TPPþ group via a long aliphatic carbon chain
greatly potentiate ATP-depleting activity of 2-DG in MCF-7
cells.

Cytotoxic effects of Mito-CP or Mito-Q in combination
with 2-DG in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells
We measured the cytotoxicity after a 6 and 24 hours of
treatment of MCF-7 and MCF-10A with either Mito-CP (1
mmol/L), Mito-Q (1 mmol/L), or Dec-TPPþ (1 mmol/L) and
varying concentrations of 2-DG under the same experimental
conditions as in Fig. 3. The cytotoxicity data obtained by
monitoring Sytox Green dye uptake normalized to the total
number of cells and are shown in Fig. 4. All 3 compounds
caused a slight increase in 2-DG cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells
after a 6 hour-treatment (Fig. 4A) that was markedly increased
after a 24-hour treatment (Fig. 4B). Combined treatment with
2-DG and either Mito-CP or Mito-Q caused a more dramatic
increase in cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells compared with MCF10A cells (Fig. 4B and D). In contrast, Dec-TPPþ (that was
devoid of nitroxide or Co-Q moiety) was equally toxic in MCF-7
and MCF-10A cells in the presence of 2-DG (Fig. 4B and D).
Similar trends were observed with regard to cell viability, as
measured by the ability of the cell to reduce resazurin to resoruﬁn. There was a modest decrease in cell viability (30%–
40%) after a 6-hour treatment with Mito-CP (1 mmol/L), Mito-Q
(1 mmol/L), or Dec-TPPþ (1 mmol/L) with varying levels of
2-DG in MCF-7 or MCF-10A cells (Supplementary Fig. S4A–D).
However, after a 24-hour treatment, Mito-CP and Mito-Q
decreased the viability of MCF-7 cells to a much greater

extent as compared with MCF-10A cells (Supplementary Fig.
S4B and D). These results are consistent with the cytotoxicity
results (Fig. 4). The glucose concentration in the media used for
MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells was different (5.56 vs. 17.5 mmol/L).
Therefore, we tested the effects of 2-DG at different concentrations. Notably, 2-DG (5 and 20 mmol/L) did not signiﬁcantly
affect the colony formation or cell death in MCF-10A cells (Figs.
4 and 5). Furthermore, we tested the cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells
cultured in media containing 17.5 mmol/L glucose (same as in
MCF-10A cells). Notably, combined treatment with 2-DG and
Mito-CP for 24 hours still caused a more dramatic increase in
cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells compared with MCF-10A cells (Fig.
4B and D and Supplementary Fig. S5). In addition, the combined treatment with Mito-CP and 2-DG elicited greater cell
death and decreased colony formation in MCF-7 cells, even
when 2-DG was used at recommended glucose concentrations
in the media for each cell type (5 in MCF-7 vs. 20 mmol/L in
MCF-10A). Incubation with the untargeted nitroxide CP or MeTPPþ with different 2-DG levels did not signiﬁcantly increase
cytotoxicity of 2-DG in either cell line even after a 24-hour
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Effects of Mito-CP, Mito-Q, or Dec-TPPþ and 2-DG on
MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-10A cell proliferation:
Clonogenic analyses
One of the hallmarks of tumor cells is the ability to form
colonies (33). As shown in Fig. 5, addition of varying levels of 2DG alone did not signiﬁcantly decrease the colony formation in
MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, or MCF-10A cells. In contrast, there was
a decrease in colony formation in MCF-7 cells when treated
with 2-DG in the presence of 1 mmol/L Mito-CP or Mito-Q.
Mito-CP was more potent than Mito-Q in inhibiting the colony
formation (Fig. 5). Figure 5B also shows the survival fractions of
MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-10A cells calculated from the
clonogenic survival assay. Both Mito-CP and Mito-Q more
potently decreased the survival fraction in MCF-7 and MDAMB-231 cells as compared with MCF-10A cells in the presence
of 2-DG. Importantly, incubation with the Dec-TPPþ and
different 2-DG levels for 6 hours did not signiﬁcantly decrease
the survival fraction in either cell line (Fig. 5).

and absence of 1 mmol/L of the indicated MTDs (Mito-CP or Mito-Q) or

using a luciferase-based assay. Data are represented as a

respectively. Data shown are the means  SEM, n ¼ 4.

Effects of Mito-CP and Mito-Q alone and in combination
with 2-DG on mitochondrial bioenergetic function in
MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells
Although treatment with Mito-CP and Mito-Q in the presence of 2-DG dramatically decreased intracellular ATP levels in
both MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells, the clonogenic survival analysis showed that this treatment selectively inhibited survival in
MCF-7 to a much greater extent than in MCF-10A cells. This
suggested that MCF-10A cells were able to recover from the
combination treatment (mitochondrial and glycolytic inhibitors), whereas the MCF-7 cells failed to recover under the same
conditions. To investigate this process in more detail, we
monitored the mitochondrial bioenergetic function in MCF7 and MCF-10A cells using the XF24 extracellular ﬂux analyzer.
The protocol for this experiment is shown in Supplementary
Fig. S7. As shown, both cell lines were treated with Mito-CP,

treatments and returned to fresh culture media. After 36 hours,
OCR was measured and the effects of adding oligomycin, FCCP,
and antimycin A were determined (Fig. 6A–D). The use of these
metabolic modulators allows determination of multiple parameters of mitochondrial function. Interestingly, the most
dramatic effect of Mito-CP was on basal OCR and the OCR
linked to ATP production (Fig. 6E). These parameters were
calculated from the traces in Fig. 6A–D (31, 32). Notably,
inhibition of OCR was persistent 36 hours after removal of
Mito-CP in MCF-7 cells, but not in MCF-10A cells. Mito-Q had a
similar effect on mitochondrial function, although the degree
of inhibition was markedly lower. The effects of Mito-CP and
Mito-Q were also examined immediately after 6 hours treatment with these compounds (Supplementary Fig. S8). Consistent with the data shown in Fig. 2, after a 6-hour exposure to
either Mito-CP or Mito-Q, mitochondrial oxygen consumption
was decreased. Curiously, the effect of these compounds was
more dramatic in MCF-10A cells as compared with MCF-7
cells. Paired with the data in Fig. 6, this suggested that MCF10A cells are more adept at recovering from inhibition of
mitochondrial function than MCF-7 cells. These data also
showed that the effect of 2-DG is not persistent after
removal. As shown in Fig. 6E, this inhibition was reversed
36 hours after removal of the 2-DG. In addition, we found
that inhibition of OCR persisted up to 60 hours after

washout of Mito-CP or Mito-Q. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. S9, the mitochondrial function was similarly inhibited
after 60 hours following washout. Inhibition of mitochondrial function was persistent in MCF-7 cells but not in MCF10A cells. Collectively, these data suggested that the mechanism for selective killing of MCF-7 cells when cotreated
with 2-DG and MTDs is through irreversible mitochondrial
inhibition.
Effects of Mito-CP and 2-DG on tumor growth: breast
cancer xenograft model
We investigated the effects of the combined use of MitoCP and 2-DG in an in vivo breast tumor model. Administration of 2-DG or Mito-CP alone had little or no effect on
the rate of tumor growth in the xenograft mouse model (Fig.
7A). In contrast, the combined treatment of Mito-CP and 2DG led to a signiﬁcant decrease in the bioluminescence
signal intensity (total ﬂux) as compared with the control
mice after 3 and 4 weeks of treatment (Fig. 7A and B).
Furthermore, this combined treatment (Mito-CP plus 2-DG)
for 4 weeks signiﬁcantly diminished tumor weight (Fig. 7C)
without causing any signiﬁcant changes in kidney, liver,
and heart weight or other major morphologic changes (as
determined by H&E staining in Supplementary Fig. S10 and
Table S1.)

Discussion
Previous research has shown that mitochondrial targeting of
antioxidants could inhibit tumor cell proliferation (25, 26).
Delocalized phosphonium cations were shown to exert antitumor activity in several tumor cell lines (35, 36). For example,
it was recently reported that Mito-CP, but not CP, induced an
increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2 in colon cancer cells (25).
Furthermore, the selective toxicity of mitochondria-targeted
vitamin-E succinate conjugated to TPPþ in tumor cells was
attributed to enhanced mitochondrial localization and binding
to complex 2 of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (37). In
other studies, selective targeting of tumor-speciﬁc cellular
energy metabolism synergistically exacerbated cytotoxicity in
cancer cells treated with antiglycolytic agents or with inhibitors of fatty acid b-oxidation (38). A metabolic shift to glycolysis occurs during antiangiogenic therapy with drugs (e.g.,

2640

bevacizumab) that block VEGF in glioblastoma (39). Upregulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway occurs during antiangiogenic
therapy. Adjuvant therapy with drugs (MTDs/2-DG combination) targeted to glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism
could be beneﬁcial in antiangiogenic therapy for treatment
of brain tumors. 2-DG was shown to potentiate cisplatindependent antiproliferative effects in ovarian carcinoma cells
expressing low levels of b-F1-ATPase (40). The combined
treatment with 2-DG (inhibitor of aerobic glycolysis) also
effectively enhanced the efﬁcacy of doxorubicin-induced chemotherapy (41).
Thus, we surmised that mitochondria-targeted antioxidants and nitroxides (SOD mimetics) would preferentially
inhibit tumor cell proliferation, but not normal cell proliferation. Several recent studies showed increased cancer cell
death in the presence of antioxidant compounds, and the

MTDs on OCR and ECAR in MCF-7
and MCF-10A cells. A–D, MCF-7 and
MCF-10A cells (20,000 cells per well)

treated with the indicated
compounds for 6 hours. The cells
were then washed with complete
media (MEM-a for MCF-7 and

with unbuffered media as described.
Five baseline OCR and ECAR
measurements were then taken
before injection of oligomycin
(1 mg/mL), to inhibit ATP synthase,
FCCP (1–3 mmol/L) to uncouple the

mechanism of action of Mito-CP and Mito-Q is presumed to
require this antioxidant capability. However, in addition to
their antioxidant properties, Mito-CP and Mito-Q might
have other unique functions due to the presence of the
alkyl chain tethered to the TPPþ group. Our results show
that the methyl-triphenylphosphonium cation alone was not
sufﬁcient to affect cancer cell proliferation. In contrast,
Decyl-TPPþ did increase cell death (Fig. 4), though the
speciﬁcity for cancer cells was notably lost. The molecular
target involved in enhancing the cytotoxic effects of TPPþ-

substituted compounds in tumor cells is presently unknown, nor do we fully understand the mechanism(s) by
which Mito-CP and Mito-Q preferentially inhibit tumor cell
proliferation.
The most salient difference between the response of MCF-7
and MCF-10A cells to MitoCP is in the stimulation of glycolysis
in response to inhibition of mitochondrial oxygen consumption (Fig. 2). MCF-10A cells have a higher apparent ability to
stimulate ECAR, indicating increased glycolytic function in
response to Mito-CP. It is likely that this stimulation of

glycolysis is better able to support ATP production in MCF-10A
cells, as compared with MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2). Maintenance of
ATP levels early in the treatment with Mito-CP suggests that

2642

Cancer Res; 72(10) May 15, 2012

the cells are better able to survive cotreatment with 2-DG.
This may happen despite a loss of ATP in both cell lines
when cotreated with Mito-CP and 2-DG (Fig. 3). It is also
worth noting that mitochondrial oxygen consumption and
glycolysis both recover more completely in MCF-10A cells as
compared with MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6). This resilience likely
underpins the preferential cytotoxicity of MitoCP and 2-DG
cotreatment in MCF-7 cells both in vitro (Fig. 5) and in vivo
(Fig. 7).
MDR-1 or p-glycoprotein, the product of the MDR1 gene, is a
multidrug transporter. Elevated levels of MDR-1 in cancer cells,
therefore, antagonize the proapoptotic effects of anticancer
drugs, rendering these cells resistant to apoptosis (42). Currently, the afﬁnity of Mito-CP to p-glycoprotein–mediated
MDR recognition is not known. Previously, it was reported
that simple nitroxides (e.g., Tempol) inhibit efﬂux of p-glycoprotein–mediated MDR-1 substrates suggesting that nitroxides act as competitive inhibitors of MDR-1 p-glycoproteins,
thereby abrogating resistance to doxorubicin (43). The present
results strongly suggest that 2-DG and Mito-CP (1 mmol/L)
synergistically induced cytotoxicity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells. Previous EPR results indicate that mitochondrial
Mito-CP levels in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells were nearly
identical (44). Several cancer cell lines in the National Cancer
Institute panel of 60 tumor cell lines, including MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-231, exhibit only very low levels of p-glycoprotein
expression (45). However, chemotherapy (i.e., doxorubicin)
could induce MDR through phenotypic modiﬁcation leading
to elevated p-glycoprotein levels (46). Under these conditions,
the intracellular levels Mito-CP could decrease via the pumping mechanism of p-glycoprotein; however, with decreased
intracellular ATP caused by Mito-CP and 2-DG, the p-glycoprotein-mediated pump activity is hindered, leading to
enhanced accumulation of cationic drugs (47). A recent publication suggests that intracellular ATP levels are a key determinant of chemoresistance in colon cancer cells (48). This
represents one hypothetical mechanism whereby inhibition of
ATP levels by Mito-CP and 2-DG may further synergize with
other classical antineoplastic drugs to enhance tumor cell
death.
Bioluminescence imaging is one of the most widely used
methods to monitor tumor growth and its therapeutic
response (49). The substrate luciferin is oxidized by luciferase-expressing cancer cells while concomitantly emitting
light (50). Thus, the signal intensity generally reﬂects the
number of cancer cells and tumor size. The oxidation of
luciferin by luciferase requires ATP as a cosubstrate. ATP
depletion should lead to diminished bioluminescence from
luciferin, independent of the tumor cell number. In this
study, the depletion of ATP caused by Mito-CP and 2-DG
in cultured MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3) was
correlated to the decrease of bioluminescence signal
induced by the same treatment in MDA-MB-231-luc cells
(Supplementary Fig. S11). The decrease in the signal intensity observed in the in vivo experiments may, therefore, be
due to inhibition of cell growth or decrease in intracellular
ATP levels in the tumor cells or both. The conﬁrmation of
the antiproliferative efﬁciency of MTDs in vivo stems from

the tumor weight data, indicating a signiﬁcantly lower tumor
weight in xenograft mice treated with Mito-CP and 2-DG.
The possibility of noninvasive monitoring of ATP levels
during treatment with MTDs and/or antiglycolytic agents
in the in vivo xenograft breast cancer model is currently
underway.
In summary, we report in this study that the combined
use of a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that is relatively nontoxic to normal cells and an antiglycolytic
agent (e.g., 2-DG) synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic
potential in breast tumor cells. As has been shown in
earlier publications (26, 28), an added value of this adjuvant therapy is the potential cytoprotective ability of
MTDs (e.g., Mito-CP and Mito-Q) against conventional
chemotherapy-induced mitochondrial oxidative damage
in normal cells, thereby increasing the overall therapeutic
index.
