BACKGROUND: African American (AA) patients with colon cancer (CC) experience worse outcomes than whites partly due to differential treatment. The National Cancer Institute’s Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP), a provider-based research network,
adopts and diffuses innovative CC treatments quickly. The authors hypothesized that CCOP participation would lessen racial differences in the receipt of oxaliplatin, an innovative treatment for CC, among patients with stage III CC in the community. METHODS: Using
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, the authors performed a population-based retrospective cohort
study of AA and white individuals aged 66 years who were diagnosed with AJCC stage III CC from 2003 through 2005. Generalized
estimating equations were used to calculate the odds of receiving an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. Predicted probabilities of oxaliplatin receipt for race-CCOP combinations were calculated. The absolute difference in oxaliplatin receipt between races was estimated using the interaction contrast ratio. RESULTS: Of 2971 included individuals, 36% received oxaliplatin, 29.5% were CCOPaffiliated, and 7.6% were AA. On multivariate analysis, early diffusion of oxaliplatin was not found to be associated with race or CCOP
participation. The probability of receiving oxaliplatin for AAs participating in a CCOP (0.46) was nearly double that of AAs who were
not participating in a CCOP (0.25; P <.05). For white individuals, the probabilities of receiving oxaliplatin did not differ by CCOP participation. For oxaliplatin receipt, the joint effects assessment suggested a greater benefit of CCOP participation among AAs (interaction contrast ratio, 1.7). CONCLUSIONS: Among older patients with stage III CC, there is a differential impact of race on oxaliplatin
receipt depending on CCOP participation. AAs treated by CCOPs were more likely to receive oxaliplatin than AAs treated elsewhere.

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States.1 It
is estimated that in 2014, a total of 136,830 Americans will be diagnosed and 50,310 will die of colorectal cancer.2 Overall, the incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer have declined since the 1980s with advances in detection, screening, and intervention for precancerous lesions.3 Caucasian American (white) individuals were leaders in colorectal cancer
incidence until 1989, when incidence became greatest among African Americans (AAs).3 In 2011, AAs were reported to
have a 20% higher incidence rate and 45% greater mortality rate from colon cancer (CC) compared with white
individuals.3
There are demonstrated disparities in incidence, treatment, and survival due to differential access and treatment use
in colorectal cancer care between AAs and whites.4-11 AAs with colorectal cancer are less likely to undergo screening and
are diagnosed at later stages than white patients, resulting in poorer outcomes.4,6-8,12,13 In a recent American Cancer Society study of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, AAs were found to have less survival improvement than whites,

which the authors suggested reflects unequal access to new
treatments.14 Several studies have demonstrated that
when equal treatment is provided, the survival difference
between the groups disappears.3,15-17
The National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Community
Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) is a cancer-focused
provider-based research network (PBRN) connecting
NCI Cooperative Groups with a nationwide network of
community physicians treating patients with cancer outside of academic medical centers. Recently, we reported
that CCOP-affiliated practices (CCOPs) adopt and diffuse innovative CC treatments more quickly than nonCCOP-affiliated practices (non-CCOPs).18 However, to
the best of our knowledge, the role of PBRNs in mitigating racial disparities in the use of treatment innovations in
community-based oncology practices is unknown.
Oxaliplatin, a treatment innovation introduced as
adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III CC in 2003, has substantially improved survival for patients with lymph
node-positive disease.19-24 Examination of the early and
rapid adoption of oxaliplatin among patients with stage
III CC offers a unique opportunity to explore racial differences in the receipt of innovative cancer care and treatment structures that may facilitate equal treatment and,
ultimately, outcomes.
In the current study, we examined differences in
oxaliplatin receipt during the innovation period, when it
was newly incorporated into treatment algorithms for
patients with stage III CC. We examined whether the
differential diffusion of oxaliplatin between races was
associated with CCOP participation of the treating practice. We hypothesized that CCOP participation would
reduce racial differences in the receipt of innovative care
for patients with stage III CC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source

We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER)-Medicare data, linked to physician and hospital
CCOP affiliation data from the CCOP program. The
SEER program collects patient demographic and clinical
data regarding incident cancers from US geographic areas
covering approximately 28% of the population and representing the populations demographics.25 The Medicare
claims data provide health insurance coverage information for >95% of Americans aged 65 years.26 The
linked SEER-Medicare data include 1.6 million individuals with cancer.25 A data use agreement with the CCOP
program allowed for acquisition of the CCOP affiliation
94

information. Information from each CCOP, including
the affiliated provider names and Unique Physician Identification Numbers, were abstracted from each CCOP’s
annual report to the NCI.
Study Population and Sample

The study sample included individuals with a first diagnosis of stage III adenocarcinoma of the colon made
between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2005.
Inclusion criteria were based on randomized controlled
trials of adjuvant therapy for stage III CC that
informed the National Institutes of Health consensus
guidelines regarding appropriate patient selection for
adjuvant chemotherapy.27 We included patients diagnosed in 2003 to capture the full picture of early
adoption; the initial results of the MOSAIC (Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin/5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin in the Adjuvant Treatment of Colon
Cancer) trial were presented in June 2003, and oxaliplatin use in patients with stage III CC may have
occurred before the US Food and Drug Administration’s approval for this indication in 2004.20
Eligible patients underwent surgical resection
within 180 days of diagnosis, initiated their first course
of chemotherapy within 120 days of surgery, and survived >30 days after surgery. We limited our sample to
white individuals and AAs aged 66 years at time of diagnosis who were continuously enrolled in Part A and
Part B fee-for-service Medicare with no health maintenance organization coverage from 12 months before
through 12 months after diagnosis (or until death). We
excluded Asian patients and did not stratify by Hispanic
ethnicity because of small sample sizes. Other excluded
patients had a primary cancer of the rectum or appendix
and were diagnosed by death certificate or autopsy. For
the comparison of oxaliplatin-containing regimens and
5-fluorouracil (5-FU), we restricted our sample to those
patients who received only these regimens.
Main Outcome

The primary outcome of the current study was receipt of
oxaliplatin-containing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens
versus 5-FU regimens without oxaliplatin within 120
days of surgery for the treatment of stage III CC.28 We
defined the outcome as an oxaliplatin-containing regimen if a patient received oxaliplatin within 35 days of
the first dose of 5-FU or capecitabine or received oxaliplatin within 120 days after surgery. These patients were
compared with those who received only 5-FU or capecitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy.

Variables of Interest

CCOP patients were defined as those who had any treatment or surgery claims from CCOP-affiliated hospitals or
physicians. We assumed that the decision regarding chemotherapy treatment occurred between surgery and the first
administration of chemotherapy and limited the analysis
to the claims made within this period. We dichotomized
the main CCOP exposure variable into any CCOP claims
(CCOP) versus no CCOP claims (non-CCOP).
We included as potential confounders factors associated with health care access, treatment patterns, and outcomes. Patient-level characteristics included race, sex, age
at the time of diagnosis, Medicaid dual eligibility status,
SEER registry regions, and census tract-level education.
Comorbidities, especially chronic neuropathy and diabetes, are important considerations in decision-making for
both oxaliplatin treatment and outcomes.29,30 In the current study population, very few patients had chronic neuropathy and the frequency of diabetes was similar for both
treatment groups and CCOP exposure groups and therefore we adjusted for these and other conditions in the
NCI combined comorbidity index.31,32 Because of small
sample sizes, some SEER regions were combined (San
Francisco, San Jose, Los Angeles, and Greater California;
Kentucky, Atlanta, and Rural Georgia; New Mexico,
Hawaii, and Utah). Tumor information included primary
site and grade. We included NCI cancer center designation and medical school affiliation as organizational characteristics of treating hospitals. Depending on their level
of affiliation with medical schools, hospitals were classified as no affiliation, limited affiliation, graduate, and
major medical school affiliation.
Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to assess bivariate associations of all variables by CCOPs. Crude odds ratios
(ORs) were constructed to compare the odds of receiving
an oxaliplatin-containing regimen by race and CCOP
affiliation. Generalized estimation equations were performed for the main analytic model to account for the
clustering of patients at the hospital level and calculate
the odds of oxaliplatin receipt. In subgroup analyses, we
examined differences in oxaliplatin receipt by race. Predicted probabilities were calculated for each race and
CCOP combination. The absolute difference in the
receipt of oxaliplatin between races was estimated using
the interaction contrast ratio (ICR), which examines
interaction on the additive scale (joint effects).33As a sensitivity analysis, we changed the definition of CCOP
patients from patients with any CCOP claims to only

those patients with CCOP claims related to chemotherapy administration. All analyses were performed using
SAS statistical software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC).
RESULTS
A total of 2971 patients were included (Fig. 1). Of these,
1071 (36%) received oxaliplatin, 875 (29.5%) were
CCOP patients, and 226 (7.6%) were AA (Table 1).
Overall, CCOP patients were more likely to be white,
female, younger, and treated at academic centers compared with non-CCOP patients and were less likely to
have Medicaid dual eligibility. However, among AAs,
there were no differences noted between CCOP and
non-CCOP patients with regard to patient, environmental, and organizational characteristics.
On univariate analysis, oxaliplatin receipt was
found to be similar across races and CCOP affiliations
(Table 2). On multivariable analysis adjusted for patient,
environmental, and organizational characteristics, the
odds of receiving oxaliplatin was significantly lower
among increasingly older populations (Table 3). Compared with patients with poorly differentiated tumors,
those with well-differentiated tumors received oxaliplatin
less often. Census tract-level education demonstrated a
clear trend of increasing odds of receiving oxaliplatin
such that patients in the most educated areas had 1.5
times greater odds of receiving oxaliplatin than patients
in the least educated areas (OR, 1.47; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI],1.16-1.85).
In the subgroup analyses, AAs who were treated
within CCOPs had greater odds of receiving oxaliplatin
compared with non-CCOP AAs (adjusted OR, 3.46;
95% CI, 1.54-7.80) (Table 4). Conversely, the odds of
receiving oxaliplatin among white individuals did not differ by CCOP participation (adjusted OR, 1.16; 95% CI,
0.89-1.49). The assessment of joint effects also suggested
a greater benefit of CCOP participation among AAs
because patients treated at CCOPs were more likely to
receive oxaliplatin compared with patients treated elsewhere (adjusted OR, 2.96; 95% CI, 1.59-5.49 [ICR,
1.7]) (Table 4). The CCOP benefit did not hold for white
patients (adjusted OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.88-1.47). Probabilities of receiving oxaliplatin for white individuals (0.23
for non-CCOP and 0.25 for CCOP patients) and AAs
(0.25 for non-CCOP and 0.47 for CCOP patients) were
found to be consistent with previous findings (Fig. 2).
Sensitivity analysis limiting the CCOP definition to
chemotherapy-related claims did not change the interpretation of any of the findings.

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we examined differences in the
receipt of an innovative cancer therapy, oxaliplatin, during the period in which it was newly incorporated into
treatment algorithms for patients with stage III CC. We
found that the relative association between being treated
at CCOPs and early oxaliplatin receipt differed by race.
It is interesting to note that despite similar patient and
socioeconomic characteristics among AAs treated at
CCOPs versus those not treated at CCOPs, AAs treated
at CCOPs were nearly twice as likely to receive the innovative therapy compared with AAs treated elsewhere. In
contrast, we observed only a small nonsignificant increase
in oxaliplatin use among white patients treated at
CCOPs. We also found that receipt of oxaliplatin
decreased with increasing age.
For patients with stage III CC, 5-FU was the standard adjuvant chemotherapy before oxaliplatin inception
as an innovative therapy in the latter part of 2003.27 Oxaliplatin use improved survival and decreased the risk of
disease recurrence compared with 5-FU in phase 3 clinical
trials and studies in community settings.19-24,34,35
CCOPs provide state-of-the-art care in the medical
setting in which most patients are treated, namely community practices.36 Patients with stage III CC who are
96

treated in CCOPs are more likely to benefit from the early
diffusion and implementation of innovative cancer therapies such as oxaliplatin.18 Within the PBRN, CCOPs
achieve their goals through academic-community cooperative groups that conduct trials whose findings inform
cancer treatment guidelines.
One desired outcome of cancer research is the
improved health of diverse populations. However, the
generalizability of research findings is hindered by underrepresentation of groups such as AAs in clinical trials.37-39
Providing AAs with access to trials CCOPs, especially Minority Based-CCOPs, appear to improve the number and
heterogeneity of clinical trial participants.40 Although
none of the patients in the current study sample were
treated by Minority Based-CCOPs, the study findings
strengthen support for CCOPs as vehicles for AAs to
access innovative cancer treatment within the community.
There are a variety of explanations for the finding
that AAs treated by CCOPs had a greater probability of
receiving innovative treatment than AAs who were treated
elsewhere. CCOP patients benefit directly from CCOP
physicians, who tend to be early adopters and diffusers of
innovative cancer therapies compared with non-CCOP
physicians.18,41,42 In addition, although non-CCOP
practices may be less likely to provide access to

addressing barriers to access are ways to decrease racial disparities in outcomes.6,8,16,17,45
Mack et al demonstrated a potentially greater survival benefit for AAs receiving oxaliplatin compared with
white individuals.35 Similar to the current study, their
report demonstrated no racial difference in the receipt of
oxaliplatin.35 Because these studies suggest there is no
racial disparity in the receipt of chemotherapy, questions
remain concerning the reasons why AA patients with CC

demonstrated that a decline in mortality from colorectal
cancer is largely a result of improvements in risk factors
and an increased screening rate,47 Sineshaw et al associated improved survival from CC with access to new

The lower rates of screening, follow-up, and adherence to treatment recommendations noted among AA
patients may reflect a greater probability of adverse effects
and poorer response to chemotherapy compared with
white individuals.5,8,10,12,48-51 In addition, the level of
educational attainment, socioeconomic status, and insurance status may determine a patient’s access to a medical

oncologist and chemotherapy receipt.7-9,49,52 In the Veterans Health Administration system, after consultation
with a medical oncologist, AA and white individuals with
the same insurance receive equivalent chemotherapy.16
We evaluated a group of equally insured older patients
and also found fairly similar rates of chemotherapy use by
race. Therefore, it is probable that once elderly AA
patients with stage III CC and similar insurance have
access to the same quality of care as white patients, outcomes will improve.
We found that older patients were less likely to
receive oxaliplatin compared with younger patients. In a
study of oxaliplatin receipt in a similar population, Mack
et al also found decreasing odds of oxaliplatin receipt with
increasing age.53 The omission of oxaliplatin in older
adults, among whom risks may outweigh benefits, is supported by a recent study demonstrating that oxaliplatin
does not provide an additional survival benefit for patients
aged >70 years with CC.54
Limitations of the Current Study

Unfortunately, data regarding the rationale for different
provider treatment decisions are not available in this data
set. However, we accounted for SEER-Medicare data limitations in the methodology and interpretation of our
results.55-57 Interaction effects should be interpreted cautiously given the modest number of AA individuals seen
by CCOPs (n 5 61). Although the percentage is not specifically small considering the percentage of AAs in the
population examined in the current study (61 of 875 individuals; 7%), generalizability may be limited. The sample
size did not allow for conclusions regarding yearly chemotherapy uptake trends for AAs, which would have
strengthened the discussion given our previous report of
increasing yearly trends in oxaliplatin uptake from 2002
to 2005.18 Because our intent was to examine the diffusion of an innovative chemotherapy, the sample patients
in the current study had already received postsurgical adjuvant therapy. However, we did not examine differences
between patients who received neither adjuvant chemotherapy (38% of white patients and 42% of AA patients)
nor surgical resection. It is possible that racial disparity is
greatest among patients who never have undergone surgical resection or among racial and ethnic subpopulations
who were not analyzed due to low representation in the
data.
Sensitivity Analysis

There are multiple ways to define CCOPs. As in the current study, based on CCOP physician or hospital claims,
Cancer

patients can be dichotomized into those receiving any care
(CCOP) versus those receiving no care (non-CCOPs). An
alternative approach is to define a CCOP by a determined
percentage of CCOP claims among all claims. In the current study, the distribution of CCOP claims skewed to
the right such that 70% of the patients herein had no
CCOP claims within the time window and among those
who had CCOP claims, the percentage of CCOP claims
was <20% for most, which made it difficult to explore
definitions other than binary categorization.
Conclusions

Among older patients with stage III CC, we found the relative association between receiving treatment at CCOPs
and early oxaliplatin use differed between AAs and white
individuals such that AA patients treated within CCOPs
were found to be more likely to receive oxaliplatin than
AAs treated elsewhere. The results of the current study
demonstrate that PBRNs effectively attenuate racial disparities in cancer treatment. Future studies should assess
the mechanisms of PBRNs for treatment delivery and
how they may be applied across the cancer care continuum. Understanding and applying the PBRN methods to
different cancers and among diverse populations will significantly influence future cancer care and cancer
disparities.
