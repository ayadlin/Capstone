BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy may improve the outcome of patients with pancreatic cancer but at an increased cost.
In this study, the authors evaluated the cost-effectiveness of modern radiotherapy techniques in the treatment of
locally advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was constructed to compare the
cost-effectiveness of 4 treatment regimens: gemcitabine alone, gemcitabine plus conventional radiotherapy, gemcitabine plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT); and gemcitabine with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).
Patients transitioned between the following 5 health states: stable disease, local progression, distant failure, local and
distant failure, and death. Health utility tolls were assessed for radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments and for
radiation toxicity. RESULTS: SBRT increased life expectancy by 0.20 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) at an
increased cost of $13,700 compared with gemcitabine alone (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] ¼ $69,500
per QALY). SBRT was more effective and less costly than conventional radiotherapy and IMRT. An analysis that
excluded SBRT demonstrated that conventional radiotherapy had an ICER of $126,800 per QALY compared with
gemcitabine alone, and IMRT had an ICER of $1,584,100 per QALY compared with conventional radiotherapy. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness to pay of
$50,000 per QALY was 78% for gemcitabine alone, 21% for SBRT, 1.4% for conventional radiotherapy, and 0.01% for
IMRT. At a willingness to pay of $200,000 per QALY, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 73% for SBRT, 20% for
conventional radiotherapy, 7% for gemcitabine alone, and 0.7% for IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that IMRT in locally advanced pancreatic cancer exceeds what society considers cost-effective. In contrast,
combining gemcitabine with SBRT increased clinical effectiveness beyond that of gemcitabine alone at a cost potenC 2011 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Controversy surrounds radiotherapy in the management of locally advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer.
Although studies by the Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group (GITSG) that were completed 2 decades ago indicated a
benefit from 5-fluorouracil (5FU)-based chemoradiotherapy,1,2 the chemotherapy regimens and radiotherapy techniques
in those trials are obsolete by today’s standards. More recently, the chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine has demonstrated
activity in pancreatic cancer when used alone3 and when combined with radiotherapy.4 In addition, the recently reported
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study E4201, which compared gemcitabine alone with gemcitabine plus radiotherapy, demonstrated a survival advantage in the combined-modality arm.5
Modern chemoradiotherapy regimens often suffer from poor rates of local control. In pancreatic cancer, local disease
progression can lead to pain and obstruction and may impact survival.6 At Stanford, we have attempted to intensify local
therapy and decrease treatment duration with the technique of single-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).7-9 At
our institution, a regimen that sandwiches a single, large, daily fraction of radiation in between cycles of gemcitabine has
resulted in excellent local control and has yielded survival rates comparable to other chemoradiotherapy regimens. Despite

the benefits of radiotherapy demonstrated in the E4201
study and in our SBRT experience, other clinical studies
comparing chemotherapy with chemoradiotherapy have
produced mixed results,10,11 and the optimal management
of locally advanced pancreatic cancer remains unclear.
Although radiotherapy has the potential to improve
outcome in pancreatic cancer, the absolute incremental
benefit of radiotherapy probably is small because of the limited survival inherent with this disease. This small, incremental benefit compounded by the high cost of radiation
brings about the question of cost-effectiveness. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of gemcitabine combined with modern radiotherapy
techniques compared with gemcitabine as a single agent in
the management of locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Decision Model
We compared the cost-effectiveness of 4 different regimens that are used to treat locally advanced pancreatic
cancer: 1) gemcitabine alone (gem-alone), 2) gemcitabine
with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (gem-RT),
3) gemcitabine with intensity-modulated radiotherapy
(gem-IMRT), and 4) gemcitabine with stereotactic body
radiotherapy (gem-SBRT). A decision-analytic Markov
model was constructed to determine the cost-effectiveness
of these 4 regimens. The 5 main health states in this model
included the following: stable disease, local progression,
distant metastatic failure, both local and distant failure,
and death (for the model schema, see Fig. 1; for the decision tree, see Fig. 2). We assumed that all patients entered
the model with stable disease and received either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy and radiation according
to their prespecified treatment regimen, as described in
detail below (see Treatment). Although, from a clinical

1120

standpoint, patients can develop distant failure after local
progression, and vice versa, our model did not allow these
transitions. Death from natural causes could occur from
any health state and was estimated from age-specific US
mortality rates.12 Death from cancer was assumed to
occur after disease progression. Patients incurred utility
tolls and costs for receiving radiotherapy, chemotherapy
or from experiencing treatment-related toxicity.
The Markov model was based on a payer’s perspective
and ran with a 1-month cycle length. Although only a small
percentage of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer survive for >2 years, the model was run over a 5-year
time horizon to avoid excluding the minority of longer-term
survivors. Costs were adjusted to 2009 dollars using the
medical component of the Consumer Price Index. Costs
and health outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. The
Markov model was built with TreeAge Pro 2009 Suite
(release 1.0.2; TreeAge Inc., Williamstown, Mass).
The cost-effectiveness of treatment regimens was
measured with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
(ICER). The base-case analysis was defined as the results of
the analysis using the data and methods that we believed
best characterized each treatment option.13 A treatment
option was considered dominated if it was more costly and
less effective than another treatment. Two cost-effectiveness
analyses were conducted: one with all 4 treatment options
and a second comparing gem-alone with conventionally
fractionated radiotherapy (gem-RT and gem-IMRT).
Model transition probabilities, costs, and utilities are
described below and are included in Table 1.
Treatment
With gem-alone and gem-RT, we used the treatment
schema and outcome data from the preliminary report of
the clinical trial E4201.5 That trial randomized patients
to receive monthly cycles of gemcitabine alone (1000 mg/

fractions) followed by monthly gemcitabine (1000 mg/
m2 every 3-4 weeks). As in the E4201 trial, we assumed
gem-RT included conventionally fractionated, 3-dimensional, conformal radiotherapy.
We assumed the gem-IMRT arm was treated with
an IMRT technique designed to spare surrounding normal tissues without sacrificing tumor control. Compared
with gem-RT, gem-IMRT received the same chemotherapy regimen and the same total radiation dose, experienced the same patterns of failure, and had the same

1122

survival. Because of the normal tissue sparing, we assumed
that toxicity from radiation was lower for gem-IMRT
compared with gem-RT.
With gem-SBRT, we used the treatment schema
developed here at Stanford.7-9 We assumed that this
group received a single cycle of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2
weekly every 3-4 weeks), followed by SBRT (25 Gy in a
single fraction), then monthly gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2
weekly every 3 of 4 weeks). We assumed that all treatment
arms received gemcitabine for a maximum of 5 cycles or
until disease progression. After any disease progression
(local, distant or both), all treatment groups received

salvage chemotherapy, which consisted of oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 5-FU18 for 2 cycles or until death.
Model Probabilities
Key probabilities for this model included the probability of
disease progression, the probability of death, and the probability of toxicity. The gem-alone, gem-RT, and gem-IMRT
probabilities were based on the E42015 clinical trial; whereas
the gem-SBRT probabilities were based on our Stanford
SBRT experience. Although the E4201 trial included only
patients with locally advanced disease, our previously published reports on SBRT included patients with locally
advanced and metastatic disease who did and did not receive
preradiation chemotherapy.7-9,19 For the current analysis, we
isolated the patients with nonmetastatic, locally advanced
pancreatic cancer who received preradiation gemcitabine followed by a single fraction of 25 Gy (n ¼ 48). These patients
were treated on protocol (n ¼ 31) and off protocol (n ¼
17), and both groups were treated identically. Progression
and survival were determined with the Kaplan-Meier
method and was calculated from the start of treatment. This
reanalysis of our SBRT data set enabled a more precise comparison with the E4201 results; however, we were unable to
directly compare our data set with E4201. Because information on true disease progression rates often are lacking, we
used disease-free survival as a surrogate.
Disease Progression, Patterns of Failure, and
Overall Survival
With the limited life span inherent in pancreatic cancer, we
suspected that our Markov model would be sensitive to disease progression and overall survival. Consequently, we sought
to model these events as accurately as possible by using transition probabilities that varied each month, thus creating costeffectiveness model outputs that replicate Kaplan-Meier plots.
Kaplan-Meier survival estimates lose precision at later time
points, when few patients remain available for analysis; therefore, when survival estimates dropped below 10%, we
assumed that survival followed SEER survival data in patients
with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.20 Once a patient progressed, they fell into 1 of 3 states: local progression alone, distant progression alone, or local and distant progression. These
patterns of failure were deduced from the E4201 trial and
from our Stanford experience.
Toxicity
We considered only grade 3 or higher gastrointestinal toxicity attributable to radiation. We assumed that grade 1/2
toxicity and chemotherapy toxicity would be similar

among the treatment arms and, thus, these explicitly were
not included in the model. For gem-RT, the rate of toxicity from radiation was defined from E4201 as the difference in gastrointestinal toxicity rates between gem-alone
(14%) and gem-RT (38%). To our knowledge, the relative decrease in toxicity from IMRT compared with conventional radiotherapy has not been reported in patients
with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. However, a dosimetric study21 estimated that IMRT would reduce small
bowel toxicity from 24.4% to 9.3%, for a 62% relative
reduction; therefore, the rate of toxicity for gem-IMRT
was assumed to be 38% that of gem-RT. The rate of toxicity from SBRT was determined from our Stanford experience.7,17 The total rates of toxicity were converted to a
constant monthly rate for each group (Table 1). Each toxicity event was assumed to last for 1 month.
Quality of Life
The health utility state for stable disease was based on
expert opinion. The health utility state for local disease
progression or distant metastatic failure was assumed to be
identical and was estimated from the literature.22 The utility decrement between stable disease and local or distant
progression was 0.06. We assumed the utility decrement
between stable disease and patients with both local and distant progression was double, or 0.12. Therefore, the utility
of stable disease was 0.68, the utility of local or distant progression was 0.62, and the utility of both local and distant
progression was 0.56. Health utility tolls refer to a 1-time,
absolute utility decrement in a given cycle. Utility tolls
were assessed for treatment and toxicity, and these values
were estimated from the literature23 (Table 1).
Cost
Treatment

The costs of radiotherapy, IMRT, SBRT, and
administering chemotherapy were derived from the 2009
Medicare Physician Fee Schedule adjusted to Santa Clara
County (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PhysicianFeeSched/
[access date February 6, 2010]). The costs of chemotherapeutic agents were determined from 2009 Medicare Part
B reimbursements. Gem-SBRT patients had small gold
fiducial markers implanted into their tumors before
SBRT for radiation tracking purposes, and these costs
were estimated from the literature.14
Toxicity

The average cost of a radiation toxicity event was
estimated from a weighted average of the costs of

1123

Original Article

individual toxicity events observed in our SBRT data set.
The cost of each event was estimated from the mean cost
identified in the 2007 US Agency for Healthcare Research
and Quality national statistics on inpatient hospital
stays.24 Specific toxicity details were not available from
the E4201 study; therefore, we assumed a similar cost per
toxicity event for gem-RT and gem-IMRT.

butions were chosen to model the probabilities of toxicity,
all utilities, and utility tolls. Fractile distributions were
used to model the number of cycles of gemcitabine and
salvage chemotherapy. Finally, gamma distributions were
used to vary the scale factor (defined above), which effectively varied the probability of disease progression and
survival. A complete list of parameters is available online
(http://171.65.6.241/AK/pancreas_CEA_PSA.pdf.

Other costs

The monthly costs of additional nontreatment medical care, including office visits, medications, laboratory,
and radiology costs, were estimated from the literature.15
The cost of end-of-life care was estimated from health
care expenditures in cancer patients during their last
month of life.16
Sensitivity Analysis
One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the Markov model. All
costs, probabilities, and utilities were varied independently in 1-way sensitivity analyses. In addition, the model
time horizon was varied (2-5 years) as was number of
gemcitabine cycles (3-7 cycles), the number of salvage
chemotherapy cycles (1-3 cycles), patient age (45-85
years), and annual discount rate (0%-5%).
With disease progression and survival, we altered the
monthly time-dependent transition probabilities to adjust
the mean survival with the following transformation:
psen(t) ¼ 1  (1  p0[t])s, where p0(t) is the original
monthly probability, psen(t) is the new monthly probability used in the sensitivity analysis, and s is the scale factor.
For each treatment regimen, we determined the scale factor range that resulted in the desired change in mean survival, and this scale factor range was used in the sensitivity
analysis. We assumed that the rates of disease progression
and death were correlated and, thus, adjusted these rates
simultaneously in the sensitivity analysis.
The costs of radiotherapy, IMRT, and SBRT
depend on several overlapping Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. To accurately represent this cost
structure in our sensitivity analysis, we varied the individual cost CPT codes as well as a global radiation oncology
reimbursement rate. This method reflects the uncertainty
in individual billing codes as well as the uncertainty in
overall reimbursement for radiation oncology.
Finally, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was preformed with a Monte Carlo simulation of 10,000 repetitions.25 With the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, all costs
were modeled with log-normal distributions. Beta distri-

RESULTS
Base-Case Analysis
Figure 3 illustrates the predicted disease progression, patterns of failure, and survival for all 4 treatment regimens.
Gem-SBRT demonstrated decreased rates of local progression and increased rates of distant metastatic failure compared with the other modalities. Gem-alone had slightly
inferior survival compared to all of the radiation regimens.
The primary cost-effectiveness analysis, including all
4 treatment options, demonstrated that gem-SBRT had
an ICER of $69,500 per quality-adjusted life-year
(QALY) compared with gem-alone (Table 2). GemSBRT dominated the more costly and less effective
options of gem-RT and gem-IMRT.
To understand the cost-effectiveness of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, we conducted a secondary
cost-effectiveness analysis excluding gem-SBRT. This
demonstrated that gem-RT had an ICER of $126,800 per
QALY compared with gem-alone. The decreased toxicity
of IMRT increased the incremental effectiveness; however, the high cost of IMRT increased the ICER above $1
million per QALY compared with conventional radiotherapy (Table 2).
Sensitivity Analysis
Table 3 demonstrates key results from the primary 1-way
sensitivity analysis comparing gem-alone with gemSBRT. The analysis indicates a high degree of sensitivity
to changes in mean survival for the gem-alone and gemSBRT arms. The ICER of gem-SBRT increased to
$200,000 per QALY when the mean survival of gemalone increased by 2.5 months or when the mean survival
of gem-SBRT decreased by 2.6 months. Conversely, the
ICER of gem-SBRT decreased below $50,000 per QALY
when the mean survival of gem-alone decreased by 2.0
months or when the mean survival of gem-SBRT
increased by 2.0 months.
One theoretical advantage of SBRT relates to its
high rate of local control; however the data supporting

this observation come from our single-institution experience. After 1 year, our model predicted that, among
patients who received gem-SBRT, 16% would fail with
local progression (8% local failure alone and 8% local þ
distant failure), and 63% would fail with distant progression (55% distant alone and 8% local þ distant). When
we assumed double the rate of local progression (32%;
16% local alone and 16% local þ distant) after gemSBRT, keeping distant failure constant (63%; 47% distant alone and 16% local þ distant), the ICER increased
to $130,000 per QALY compared with gem-alone. In
addition, our model assumed the rate of death was identi-

cal after either local or distant progression; however, the
relation between local progression and survival in locally
advanced pancreatic cancer is debatable. If we halved the
rate of death after local progression (holding the rate of
death after distant failure constant), the ICER of gemSBRT increased to $88,000 per QALY. When we reduced
the rate of death after local progression to zero, then all
radiation options added only cost and toxicity and, subsequently, were dominated by gem-alone.
The base-case analysis derived rates of gem-SBRT
disease progression and survival from our institutional experience. If we assumed that gem-SBRT had rates of

disease progression and survival identical to the rates of
gem-RT in E4201, then the ICER of gem-SBRT would
increase slightly to $92,800 per QALY. This lower ICER
of gem-SBRT compared with gem-RT came from the
lower cost of SBRT compared with radiotherapy.
We undertook a secondary 1-way sensitivity analysis
between gem-RT and gem-IMRT to explore conditions in
which IMRT might be considered cost-effective. The basecase analysis assumed identical survival for gem-RT and
gem-IMRT. If we relaxed this assumption, then the mean
survival of gem-IMRT would have to increase by 1.0
months over gem-RT to bring the ICER of gem-IMRT
down from $1,584,100 per QALY to $200,000 per
QALY, and it would have to increase by 4.8 months to
bring the ICER of gem-IMRT to $50,000 per QALY. In
addition, the base-case analysis assumed that IMRT
reduced the rate of toxicity to 38% compared with gemRT. If we assumed that IMRT eliminated radiation toxicity, then the ICER of gem-IMRT only decreased to
$843,200 per QALY.
Finally, we conducted a probabilistic sensitivity
analysis with all 4 treatment options (Fig. 4). The probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness to pay of
$50,000 per QALY was 78% for gem-alone, 21% for
gem-SBRT, 1.4% for gem-RT, and 0.01% for gemIMRT. Conversely, the probability of cost-effectiveness at
a willingness to pay of $200,000 per QALY was 73% for
gem-SBRT, 20% for gem-RT, 7% for gem-alone, and
0.7% for gem-IMRT. At willingness-to-pay levels above
$70,900 per QALY, gem-SBRT surpassed gem-alone to
become the most likely cost-effective treatment option.
And, as the willingness-to-pay threshold increased above

DISCUSSION
Advances in the field of radiation oncology have led to
improvements in imaging and targeting as well as radiation treatment delivery. This gain in technology allows
the delivery of an increased radiation dose to tumor and a
decreased dose to surrounding normal tissues. Although
these advances have the potential to increase tumor control and decrease toxicity, randomized clinical evidence
supporting their widespread adoption does not exist. Plus,
the potentially small absolute survival benefits of these
advances come at a large cost. These technology innovations in radiation oncology naturally lead to the question
of cost-effectiveness—an extremely relevant subject in
today’s health care economy.
Perhaps the most pertinent finding of this study
relates to the cost-effectiveness of IMRT. In the current
study, we observed that IMRT had an ICER >$1,500,000
per QALY, likely because of the small incremental survival
benefit combined with the large increase in cost. Even
when we assumed that IMRT improved survival, it would
have to increase mean survival by 4.8 months over conventional radiotherapy before IMRT becomes cost-effective at
a $50,000 per QALY threshold. These findings provide
useful insight into the cost-effectiveness of IMRT and indiCancer

cate that justifying this treatment from a cost-effectiveness
standpoint would require a substantial improvement in
survival or a large decrease in cost. The findings in this
study emphasize the fact that this expensive technology will
unlikely be cost-effective in diseases like pancreatic cancer
that have such limited survival. Although IMRT was more
expensive than conventional radiotherapy, we observed
that SBRT was significantly less expensive than other forms
of radiotherapy. Despite the increased technology demands
with SBRT, the shorter treatment duration results in an
overall decrease in cost compared with conventional
radiotherapy.
The challenge of interpreting cost-effectiveness analyses in the United States arises from the lack of a definitive
willingness-to-pay threshold. The United States does not
have a set monetary threshold below which a treatment is
considered ‘‘cost effective.’’26,27 The commonly cited value
of $50,000 per QALY arose in 1982 as the estimated costeffectiveness of dialysis in patients with chronic renal failure; however, many consider this value well below what
society would currently consider acceptable.26 A recent
report estimates that $183,000 to $264,000 per QALY
more accurately reflects society’s willingness to pay for
health care.28 This current study found that gem-SBRT
had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $69,500 per
QALY compared with gem-alone, which is below several
willingness-to-pay thresholds but above the commonly
cited $50,000 per QALY threshold. Other cost-effectiveness studies involving radiation in pancreatic cancer have
produced similar results. Krzyzanowska et al,23 reported
that 5-FU-based chemoradiotherapy had an ICER of
$68,724 per QALY compared with no treatment. Krzyzanowska et al also observed that gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy would have an ICER <$100,000 per QALY
compared with 5-FU chemoradiotherapy if the gemcitabine regimen improved survival by 5% at 1 year. Conversely, adding erlotinib to gemcitabine in advanced
pancreatic cancer (improvement in median survival, <1.5
weeks) increased cost by $364,680 to $400,000 per lifeyear gained,29,30 which far exceeds what we observed with
radiotherapy or SBRT in the current study.
Another important finding of this study pertains to
the high degree of sensitivity our model exhibited to
changes in survival. This observation reflects the small
absolute incremental benefit of radiotherapy compounded
by the large cost. The sensitivity to survival naturally leads
to a tight correlation between clinical data used to inform
the model and the results. Had we informed our model
with other trials of gemcitabine-based treatments10 or

1127

different SBRT regimens,31 our results may have differed.
Ultimately, we chose clinical studies for this model that
provided the highest level of evidence while allowing
direct comparison between treatment arms.
The main limitations of this analysis relate to the data
used to inform the Markov model. The clinical trial E4201
that we used to inform the gem-alone and gem-RT groups
in our cost-effectiveness model closed early because of poor
accrual, and only preliminary results have been reported.
Despite this, all eligible patients in the E4201 trial had died
by the time of preliminary analysis, suggesting that the final
toxicity, progression, and survival estimates will not change.
In addition, a preliminary report from a separate, randomized phase 2 study comparing gemcitabine alone with gemcitabine plus radiotherapy indicated a survival benefit in
the radiotherapy group.32 This second study agrees with
the results from E4201 and adds support to our cost-effectiveness modeling assumption that gem-RT had improved
outcomes compared with gem-alone.
Another limitation relates to the fact that the Markov
model in our study compared the preliminary results from
a phase 3 clinical trial (gem-alone and gem-RT in E4201)
with phase 2 clinical data (gem-SBRT). We were unable to
account for differences in study populations between our
Stanford SBRT cohort and the E4201 cohorts. Differences
in patient characteristics, treatment, or follow-up could
bias the results of this study. Ideally, our cost-effective
model would be informed with a randomized study comparing all 4 treatment regimens (gem-alone, gem-RT, gemIMRT, and gem-SBRT). Realistically, such a trial would
be challenging to complete given the inherent difficulty
with patient accrual into multimodality trials.33 Plus, the
large sample sizes required to detect the anticipated small
differences in outcome make such a trial infeasible. Despite
these limitations, our model predicted no significant survival advantage for gem-RT or gem-SBRT (see Fig. 3). In
addition, when we assumed that gem-SBRT produced survival identical to that produced by gem-RT in the E4201
trial, the ICER for gem-SBRT remained relatively
unchanged at $92,800 per QALY.
In addition to our primary data, other limitations in
this study relate to the assumptions used to build the costeffectiveness model. Similar to other cost-effectiveness analyses, this analysis excluded grade 1/2 toxicity. Differing
rates of low-grade toxicity among the treatment arms may
have biased our results. However, the sensitivity analysis
indicated that assumptions about grade 3/4 toxicity did not
alter our conclusions, suggesting that low-grade toxicity
would be unlikely to affect the model. Another limitation

1128

concerns our assumptions about supportive care. In pancreatic cancer, supportive care is complex and includes components such as pain, jaundice, weight loss, gastric or biliary
obstruction, diabetes, pancreatic insufficiency, paraneoplastic syndromes, chronic nausea, vomiting or diarrhea,
and depression. Some of these costs were accounted for
indirectly in our estimation of additional medical expenses
and end-of-life care, and the decrement in quality of life
was partially reflected in our health utility states. Precise
accounting for the costs and quality-of-life outcomes with
these events would be challenging, and our current study
excluded these events. Differences in costs or benefits of
supportive care between treatment arms could have biased
our results in unpredictable ways. A final limitation pertains to the finding that health utility states are poorly
defined in pancreatic cancer and are derived mostly from
expert opinion. Despite this limitation, the model proved
insensitive to changes in utility (Table 3), suggesting that
more precise estimates would not alter our conclusions.
In summary, this study provides a useful framework
for comparing the tradeoff between the benefits and burdens of radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. IMRT in this population surpasses what
society considers cost-effective. Conversely, combining
gemcitabine with SBRT increases the clinical effectiveness
beyond gemcitabine alone at a cost potentially acceptable
by today’s standards.
