Abstract
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like
growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) can cooperate to regulate
tumor growth and survival, and synergistic growth inhibition
has been reported for combined blockade of EGFR and IGF-IR.
However, in preclinical models, only a subset of tumors exhibit
high sensitivity to this combination, highlighting the potential
need for patient selection to optimize clinical efficacy. Herein,
we have characterized the molecular basis for cooperative
growth inhibition upon dual EGFR and IGF-IR blockade and
provide biomarkers that seem to differentiate response. We
find for epithelial, but not for mesenchymal-like, tumor cells
that Akt is controlled cooperatively by EGFR and IGF-IR. This
correlates with synergistic apoptosis and growth inhibition
in vitro and growth regression in vivo upon combined blockade of both receptors. We identified two molecular aspects
contributing to synergy: (a) inhibition of EGFR or IGF-IR
individually promotes activation of the reciprocal receptor;
(b) inhibition of EGFR-directed mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) shifts regulation of Akt from EGFR toward IGFIR. Targeting the MAPK pathway through downstream MAPK/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) antagonism similarly promoted IGF-driven pAkt and synergism with
IGF-IR inhibition. Mechanistically, we find that inhibition
of the MAPK pathway circumvents a negative feedback loop
imposed on the IGF-IR– insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)
signaling complex, a molecular scenario that parallels the
negative feedback loop between mTOR-p70S6K and IRS-1 that
mediates rapamycin-directed IGF-IR signaling. Collectively,
these data show that resistance to inhibition of MEK, mTOR,
and EGFR is associated with enhanced IGF-IR–directed Akt
signaling, where all affect feedback loops converging at the
level of IRS-1. [Cancer Res 2008;68(20):8322–32]

esis for a multitude of tumor types (1–4). Tumors can exhibit
redundancy surrounding these RTKs that contributes to de novo
resistance to a single RTK inhibitor, and crosstalk between RTKs can
confer acquired resistance, whereby inhibition of one RTK
is compensated by enhanced activity through the reciprocal
RTK (5–14). These observations suggest that a combinatorial
regimen targeting both EGF receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth
factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) may yield greater anticancer activity.
Although the combination of EGFR and IGF-IR inhibitors has
shown synergistic growth inhibition in preclinical models, the
molecular mechanism for the cross-talk between EGFR and IGFIR that mediates cooperativity has not yet been thoroughly
investigated. Furthermore, the identification of molecular markers
that could be used to refine patient subgroups most likely to
receive maximal benefit from this specific combination therapy
has not yet been described. We have recently reported the novel
small molecule IGF-IR kinase inhibitor PQIP (15). Herein, we
show that PQIP exhibits broad efficacy against a range of tumor
types. Similar to observations made for erlotinib, sensitivity to
IGF-IR inhibition seems to be greater in epithelial tumor cells
compared with tumor cells that have undergone an epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT). PQIP synergized with erlotinib to
inhibit cell growth and survival, and cooperativity was more
extensive in epithelial than mesenchymal tumor cells. For
epithelial tumor xenografts, the combination of erlotinib and
PQIP promoted growth regressions during treatment and
enhanced the durable cure rate.
We explored the molecular mechanism underlying the observed
synergism for epithelial tumors. Inhibition of IGF-IR results in
induced EGFR activity, highlighting reciprocity as one aspect
contributing to cooperativity. Akt activity seems to be regulated
through a combination of EGF and IGF signaling, and only dual
targeting of both RTKs achieved complete and sustained Akt
inhibition. Mechanistically, we find that inhibition of EGFRdirected mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
activity conveys enhanced coupling of IGF-IR to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-PDK1-Akt pathway. Specifically, we
show that ability of erlotinib to block activity within the MAPK
pathway leads to inhibition of serine phosphorylation of insulin
receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), and this is associated with more
effective signal flow from IGF-IR to Akt. Inhibition of the MAPK
pathway using a specific inhibitor of MAPK/extracellular signalregulated kinase kinase (MEK) also conferred enhanced IGFdriven Akt activity and sensitized tumor cells to PQIP. These
results provide mechanistic understanding for the combined
targeting of IGF-IR and EGFR and highlight the potential clinical
utility of this combination.

Feedback Mechanisms and EGFR and IGF-IR Cooperativity

Materials and Methods
PQIP. PQIP (cis-3-[3-(4-methyl-piperazin-l-yl)-cyclobutyl]1-(2-phenylquinolin-7-yl)-imidazo[1,5]pyrazin-8-ylamine) was synthesized, as previously
described (15).
Cell lines. Cells were cultured in media, as prescribed by the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) containing 10% FCS. With the exception of
GEO (obtained from RPCI), all tumor cells were obtained from ATCC. Cell
lines were designated as epithelial or mesenchymal, as described in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell proliferation. Proliferation was determined using Cell Titer Glo
(Promega), and apoptosis was determined by Caspase Glo (Promega), as
previously described (16).
Analysis of cooperativity. The Bliss additivism model was used to
analyze the cooperativity of drug interactions. This model and rationale for
its use has been previously described (16).
Protein lysates and Western blotting. Lysates were prepared, as
previously described (16). Antibodies (Cell Signaling) included EGFR,
phosphorylated EGFR (Y1068), phosphorylated p42/p44, phosphorylated
Akt (473), phosphorylated Akt (308), Akt, phosphorylated S6 (235/236), and
S6. Where indicated, 10 ng/mL EGF or 40 ng/mL IGF were added for 5 min
before lysis.
RTK proteome array. Proteome profiler arrays (R&D Systems) were
processed according to manufacturer’s protocol. RTKs included on the array
are listed in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
IGF-IR ELISA. Cell lysates were transferred into 96-well plates precoated
with IGF-IR capture antibody (Santa Cruz) and incubated overnight. Target
protein was probed with an anti–pY-HRP–conjugated antibody (PY20;
Zymed) followed by chemiluminescence detection (Pierce).
Quantitative PCR. cDNA was prepared, as previously described (17).
Gene expression assays for IGF-I/ IGF-II (Applied Biosystems) were used to
quantitate relative gene expression using 100 ng cDNA on an ABI 7300
system. Values were compared with amplification of glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
Knockdown of IGF-IR and EGFR. IGF-IR and EGFR small interfering
RNA (siRNA) were SmartPools (Dharmacon, NM_000875 and NM_201283).
Nonspecific siRNA was from Qiagen. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen; ref. 16).
In vivo antitumor efficacy studies. Female athymic nude nu/nu CD-1
mice (6–8 wk, 22–29 g; Charles River Laboratories) were maintained as
previously described. Dosing of animals is described in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.

Results
Multiple tumor types respond to IGF-IR inhibition by PQIP.
Sensitivity to PQIP was determined for a panel of 27 tumor cell lines
(Fig. 1A). Cells treated with 3 Amol/L PQIP (structure; Supplementary Fig. S1) exhibited a range of sensitivities (2–72% maximal
growth inhibition), and the median growth inhibition, in response to
3 Amol/L PQIP, for the panel was 37% (Fig. 1A). PQIP (3 Amol/L) was
selected as a dose to evaluate maximal growth inhibition; however,
effects of varying concentrations of PQIP on proliferation was
determined for all cell lines, and representative data is shown in
Supplementary Fig. S1, demonstrating that growth inhibition by
PQIP is dose-dependent. Selected tumor cell lines included in this
panel harbor known activating mutations in PI3K (indicated by *;
Fig. 1A), suggesting that their proliferation might be IGFIR–independent. However, we find that PI3K mutations are not
uniformly predictive of insensitivity to IGF-IR antagonism.
We have reported that epithelial tumor cells are more sensitive to
EGFR inhibition than tumor cells that have undergone an EMT-like
transition (17, 18), and recent reports have provided additional
evidence that proteins related to EMT are predictive of sensitivity to
EGFR inhibition for a variety of tumor types, including lung,

www.aacrjournals.org

pancreas, colon, and bladder (17, 19, 20). Moreover, EMT biomarkers
seem to be predictive of erlotinib response clinically (21). Herein, we
find that EMT status also imparts differential sensitivity to IGF-IR
inhibition, wherein epithelial tumor cells are substantially more
sensitive than those that have undergone EMT. Seventy percent of
epithelial tumor cells achieved growth inhibition greater than the
median growth inhibition of the panel, and inhibition of >50% was
not observed for any mesenchymal cell line. These data suggest that
EMT markers could be useful to identify patients most likely to
respond to IGF-IR inhibition.
Although all tumor cells evaluated expressed IGF-IR, expression
level did not correlate with sensitivity (data not shown); however,
sensitive tumor cells presented higher phosphorylated IGF-IR than
insensitive tumor cells and epithelial tumor cells showed higher
phosphorylated IGF-IR than mesenchymal tumor cells (Fig. 1A and
Supplementary Fig. S2). These data support the enhanced
dependence on IGF-IR for epithelial, compared with mesenchymal,
tumors. Tumor cells expressed varying levels of IGF-I/IGF-II
(Supplementary Fig. S2); however, autocrine expression did not
uniformly correlate with sensitivity to IGF-IR inhibition. Sensitivity
measurements were conducted in the presence of 10% FCS, where
exogenous IGF could also drive IGF-IR signaling. Previous reports
have indicated that although the growth of selected tumors can be
driven by autocrine IGF signals, the growth of others is directed by
IGF expressed by tumor-associated stromal cells in a juxtacrine
manner (22, 23), suggesting that autocrine signals may not be
required for IGF-IR dependence.
The IGF-IR inhibitor PQIP synergizes with the EGFR
inhibitor erlotinib. We sought to determine the effects of
combining the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib with PQIP and if EMT
status might confer differential effects. Sensitivity to the combination of 3 Amol/L PQIP with 10 Amol/L erlotinib was determined for
a panel of 22 tumor cell lines of varying EMT states. The maximal
growth inhibition achieved for the combination is compared with
that theoretically expected for additivity (Bliss analysis; Fig. 1B, red
line). The combination achieved a median growth inhibition of 71%
(Fig. 1B, dashed red line) in response to the combination of 3 Amol/L
PQIP and 10 Amol/L erlotinib, and growth inhibition greater than
this was observed only in epithelial tumor cell lines, suggesting that
EMT status is an important marker of response. Six of thirteen
epithelial tumor cell lines exhibited maximal growth inhibition of
>95%. Mesenchymal tumor cell lines exhibited a greater range of
sensitivities to the combination (7–75% growth inhibition);
however, the majority (10 of 13) of mesenchymal cell lines showed
lower sensitivity than the epithelial tumor cells, and the
combination was synergistic only in a small population of
mesenchymal lines. The growth inhibitory effects for combining
erlotinib with PQIP were dose-dependent (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Synergistic growth inhibition was reflected by both maximal
growth inhibition and potency. For BxPC3 pancreatic tumor cells,
the combination achieved an increase in maximal growth
inhibition (40–98%), accompanied by an 8-fold gain in potency
for PQIP (800–100 nmol/L).
The specificity of PQIP toward IGF-IR has been previously
described; however, to confirm that the capacity for PQIP to
synergize with erlotinib was due to inhibition of IGF-IR
specifically, and not to other potential off-target effects, we
evaluated the combination of erlotinib with neutralizing antibodies targeting IGF-IR. We find that two antibodies, MAB391 and
a-IR3, cooperate with erlotinib to inhibit overall cell growth
(Supplementary Fig. S4).

(100 mg/kg and 75 mg/kg, qd1-10, closed

xenograft tumors compared with
vehicle-treated control mice (closed
diamonds ; bottom ). Erlotinib (100 mg/kg)
was given orally by daily dosing with or
without PQIP (25, 50, or 75 mg/kg). In
comparison, a subset of mice received
75 mg/kg PQIP alone. Once daily, 75 mg/kg
PQIP were selected for single-agent
dosing. Previous studies had indicated
that 75 mg/kg PQIP achieved plasma
concentrations of f5 Amol/L PQIP at 2 h
after dosing, which was associated with
inhibition of tumoral IGF-IR phosphorylation
and which was sustained for 24 h (15). For
evaluating the effects of combining PQIP
with erlotinib on the growth of established
xenograft tumors, 75, 50, and 25 mg/kg
doses were selected, as in vitro studies
have shown that erlotinib can improve the
potency for PQIP, and therefore, lower doses
may be sufficient to affect tumor growth.

We sought to determine if the combination of PQIP and erlotinib could evoke inhibition of cell survival (Fig. 1C). For epithelial,
but not mesenchymal, tumor cells, erlotinib achieved inhibition of
downstream pErk signaling. Erlotinib alone achieved minimal apoptosis for evaluation, consistent with its predominant single-agent
activity being cytostatic. PQIP achieved varying extents of
apoptosis, and three epithelial tumor cell lines were among those
that achieved a 2-fold to 5-fold induction in apoptosis. However, in
combination, erlotinib synergized with PQIP to promote apoptosis

in all epithelial tumor cell lines tested, whereas this effect was
either absent or more modest for mesenchymal tumor cells. The
synergistic apoptosis was dose-dependent and is shown for two
representative epithelial models, NCI-H292 and BxPC3 (Supplementary Fig. S5A, top and bottom, respectively). Collectively, these
data show how EMT markers might predict tumors most likely to
respond to the combined blockade of IGF-IR and EGFR.
To further establish cooperativity between EGFR and IGF-IR,

poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase or caspase-3 cleavage (Supplementary Fig. S5B). By this sensitive approach, erlotinib achieved
measurable apoptosis for both cell lines; however, this was
inhibited by exogenous IGF, indicating that IGF-IR signaling can
circumvent EGFR inhibition to maintain cell survival. In the
presence of IGF, enhanced apoptosis was detected in cells treated
with the combination.

The combination of erlotinib and PQIP achieves tumor
growth regression in vivo. The antitumor efficacy of PQIP and
erlotinib was evaluated using mouse xenografts for two epithelial

significant effect on tumor growth for the mesenchymal model

but statistically significant antitumor activity (51% TGI) was
achieved (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Table S1). However, in this
mesenchymal tumor model, the combination failed to achieve
growth regression or meaningful growth delay. In contrast, we
observed enhanced activity for the two epithelial models, NCI-H292
and NCI-H441. Erlotinib (10 mg/kg) alone resulted in 100% TGI
that was accompanied by 71% maximum tumor regression. Once
daily PQIP (75 mg/kg) alone resulted in f59% TGI without
evidence of regression (Fig. 1D). However, when PQIP was dosed at
50 or 75 mg/kg in combination with erlotinib, the antitumor
efficacy achieved for the NCI-H292 xenografts was statistically
significantly greater than that observed with erlotinib alone, as
shown by an increase in maximum regression to >90% in each
combination group. Additionally, when 50 mg/kg PQIP was dosed
with erlotinib, a 37.5% durable cure rate (three of eight mice) was
observed (Supplementary Table S1; Fig. 1D). In a similar manner,
coadministration of PQIP with erlotinib exhibited more potent
antitumor activity in NCI-H441 epithelial xenografts than either of

www.aacrjournals.org

the inhibitors alone. For the group receiving 100 mg/kg erlotinib in
combination with 75 mg/kg PQIP, f48% maximum tumor
regression was observed. In contrast, no evidence of tumor
regression was found in mice dosed with either agent alone, and
<5% regression was observed with erlotinib alone (Supplementary
Table S1; Fig. 1D). For these three models, the highest dose
combinations resulted in 22% to 25% body weight loss, suggesting
this is the maximum tolerated dose in the mice. However, we do
not feel that body weight loss is contributing to improved efficacy
because no tumor regressions were seen in the NCI-H460 model
although 22% body weight loss was observed. Hence, the growth
modulation observed for these non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
cells in vitro correlated with their responsiveness to erlotinib and
PQIP combination treatments in vivo, and collectively, these data
suggest that epithelial tumors will maximally benefit from this
combination.
IGF-IR inhibition augments EGFR signaling. We sought to
explore whether resistance to IGF-IR inhibition was specific to

EGFR or if other RTKs could also compensate. We screened for
changes in RTK phosphorylation using an antibody array for 42
RTKs against GEO tumor cells treated with erlotinib, PQIP, or
the combination. Treatment with 5Amol/L PQIP resulted in inhibition of IGF-IR that was accompanied by an increase in the
phosphorylation of EGFR and HER3 (Fig. 2A). We also observed a
small but significant (f2-fold) increase in IGF-IR phosphorylation
in cells treated with erlotinib. We found no detectable changes
in the phosphorylation of any other RTK included in this panel
(data not shown), indicating that pathways giving rise to
resistance to IGF-IR inhibitors might be primarily driven by
EGFR. By Western blotting, we confirmed a clear increase in EGFR
and HER3 phosphorylation for GEO cells upon treatment with
PQIP (Fig. 2B). EGFR transactivation of HER3 confers activation of
the PI3K-Akt pathway in epithelial tumor cell lines, indicating that
Akt signaling through EGFR specifically, and not other RTKs,
might limit the sensitivity to IGF-IR antagonism (24). HER3, whose
expression is repressed by transcription factors important for
EMT, has been previously shown to be predominantly expressed in
epithelial tumor cell lines, and we have found that erlotinib
inhibits Akt primarily in epithelial tumor cells (24, 25). These data
are consistent with our initial observations, herein, where
synergistic growth inhibition and apoptosis by the EGFR and
IGF-IR inhibitor combination occurs primarily in epithelial tumor
cell lines, providing a mechanism underlying EMT status as a
biomarker predictive of response to combined blockade of EGFR
and IGF-IR.
We further investigated the capacity for inhibition of IGF-IR to
confer increased EGFR activity by molecular approaches. Using
siRNA toward IGF-IR, we obtained a partial knockdown of protein
levels for BxPC3 epithelial tumor cells (Fig. 2C, right). Consistent

with data obtained for PQIP, IGF-IR knockdown conferred
increased phosphorylated EGFR (Fig. 2C, left). Antibodies toward
specific phosphorylation sites of EGFR-Y1068/Y845/Y1173 revealed
an increase in pEGFR by >2-fold upon knockdown of IGF-IR
(Fig. 2C, right). These data confirm that inhibition of IGF-IR specifically, by PQIP, is responsible for the evoked increase in EGFR
activity.
Erlotinib exibits a high degree of selectivity for EGFR, inhibiting
EGFR with >200-fold (HER2) and >1000-fold (within a panel of 20
other kinases evaluated) selectivity over other kinases; therefore,
erlotinib provides a very specific pharmacologic tool to evaluate
changes in cellular signaling upon inhibition of EGFR. However, we
sought to confirm, by other methods, the capacity of EGFR signaling
to affect cellular dependence on IGF-IR. Using siRNA, we obtained a
partial knockdown of EGFR protein levels (f40%), which was
associated with a partial induction in IGF-IR phosphorylation of
f1.8-fold for BxPC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5C, left). To further
confirm how changes in EGFR signaling affect sensitivity to
inhibition of the IGF-IR pathway, we determined the effect of EGF
treatment on the sensitivity to PQIP for H292 tumor cells. As
inhibition of EGFR had increased signaling through IGF-IR and
sensitivity to the IGF-IR antagonist PQIP, we find that increased
signaling through EGFR, upon stimulation with exogenous ligand,
blocks cellular dependence on IGF-IR, as indicated by the decreased
sensitivity to the IGF-IR inhibitor PQIP (Supplementary Fig. S5C,
right). This was reflected by both a 2-fold decrease in potency and
reduced maximal growth inhibition (65–32%) for the IGF-IR
inhibitor. Collectively, these data illustrate the cooperativity
between IGF-IR and EGFR to affect cellular growth.
Akt is regulated cooperatively by IGF and EGF for epithelial
tumor cells. For the epithelial tumor cell lines GEO and BxPC3,

Feedback Mechanisms and EGFR and IGF-IR Cooperativity

Figure 6. Inhibition of the MAPK pathway promotes Akt phosphorylation and cell survival, and this is blocked by PQIP. A, effect of 24-h treatment of BxPC3 cells
with erlotinib, PQIP, the combination of erlotinib (10 Amol/L) and PQIP (5 Amol/L), or PD98059 (3 Amol/L) on the phosphorylation of Erk, IRS-1 (S636-639),
IRS-1 (Y896), Akt (308), Akt (473), and S6. B, effect of PD98059, alone or in combination with PQIP, on the phosphorylation of Akt for both the T308 and S473

erlotinib, but not PQIP, affected Erk phosphorylation, and under
serum-starved conditions, only EGF activated Erk (Fig. 3A and B).
However, activity within the Akt-mTOR-S6 pathway seemed to be
regulated jointly by EGFR and IGF-IR. When BxPC3 cells were
treated with erlotinib or PQIP for 2 hours, pAkt-S473 levels were
reduced to f50%, and the combination of erlotinib and PQIP
achieved an additive decrease in pAkt-S473. Under serum-starved
conditions, both IGF and EGF could stimulate pAkt-S473/T308
(Fig. 3B). For GEO cells, although we observed inhibition of pAktS473 only by PQIP, we were able to detect both IGF-driven and
EGF-driven pAkt-S473/T308 under serum-free conditions.

We selected BxPC3 cells as our model to explore the
mechanism, whereby the EGFR and IGF-IR pathways couple to
regulate Akt and promote survival. Under 10% FCS conditions,
erlotinib inhibited pAkt-S473/T308 after 2 hours of treatment;
however, significant inhibition of pAkt was not sustained after
24 hours of treatment, despite the ability of erlotinib to inhibit
EGFR-HER3 signaling, equivalently at both time points (Fig. 4A).
We observed a similar trend for IGF-IR inhibition, where PQIP
was substantially more effective in inhibiting pAkt-S473/T308
after 2 hours of treatment than 24 hours (Fig. 4A). At 24 hours
PQIP treatment, we also observe an increase in pEGFR for BxPC3

cells, consistent with results obtained for GEO cells. To test
whether erlotinib acted to promote IGF-driven Akt, by 24 hours
after treatment, we treated BxPC3 cells with either erlotinib or
PQIP for 2 or 24 hours followed by 5-minute stimulation with
EGF or IGF (Fig. 4B). Erlotinib-inhibited EGF-stimulated pAktT308 equally well at both time points. However, for IGF-treated
cells, we find that, whereas erlotinib inhibited pAkt in cells
treated for 2 hours, erlotinib had no effect on pAkt in 24-hour
treated cells although erlotinib was still bioactive at 24 hours
after dosing, as shown by its ability to still inhibit EGF-stimulated
Akt and its ability to achieve equivalent inhibition of EGFR and
HER3 at both 2 and 24 hours after dosing (Fig. 4A). These data
indicate the enhanced potential for IGF to drive pAkt after
prolonged erlotinib treatment. Furthermore, although the singleagent inhibitors of EGFR and IGF-IR are both less efficacious
after 24 hours of treatment, the combination is equally
efficacious (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S5). The combination
achieved additive Akt inhibition at 2 hours after dosing but
synergistic inhibition of Atk at 24 hours after dosing. Herein,
synergy was defined as inhibition of Akt greater than that
calculated using the BLISS model. The ability of erlotinib to
inhibit Akt phosphorylation synergistically with PQIP is dosedependent (Fig. 4D). The combination of erlotinib and PQIP
maximally achieved 84% inhibition of Akt; >50% inhibition
theoretically expected based upon the BLISS model. Collectively,
these data indicate how inhibition of EGFR by erlotinib is
accompanied by enhanced IGF-IR signaling, which acts to sustain
activation of the Akt pathway.
Erlotinib enhances IGF-IR signaling by promoting signal
flow through the IGF-IR/IRS-1/Akt axis. We sought to explore
the mechanism whereby erlotinib could enhance IGF-driven Akt
activity. IGF-IR relies on a scaffold, IRS-1 to relay signals to downstream effectors. The phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Y-sites by IGFIR provides docking sites for the SH2 domain of p85-PI3K (26–28).
Scaffold functions for IRS-1 are elegantly regulated through both
tyrosine and serine phosphorylation. Whereas Y-phosphorylation
promotes the ability of IGF-IR to couple to Akt, S-phosphorylation
inhibits IRS-1 functions. S-phosphorylation inhibits IRS-1 activity
through several proposed mechanisms including (a) promoting
ubiquitination and down-regulation, (b) sterically blocking
interactions with IGF-IR and/or docking effectors, (c) altering
the subcellular localization (27). S-phosphorylation of IRS-1 can
be achieved by multiple feedback loops within the cell. p70S6
kinase, which lies downstream of the Akt-mTOR cascade, has
been reported to phosphorylate IRS-1 and promote its inactivation. Inhibition of signaling downstream of mTOR has been
shown to promote IGF-driven Akt activity. The mTOR inhibitor
rapamcyin conveys an increase in IGF-dependent Akt activity for
selected tumor cells, and synergistic growth inhibition for the
combination of rapamycin with an IGF-IR inhibitor has been
recently reported (29). Indeed, we have also observed synergistic
growth inhibition for the combination of PQIP with Rapamycin
(data not shown).
We wondered whether erlotinib might also promote IGFdriven Akt activity by affecting the phosphorylation state of
IRS-1. We measured the ability of the EGFR or IGF-IR inhibitors
to affect IRS-1 phosphorylation at selected pY and pS sites for
BxPC3 and GEO cells. pY612-IRS-1 is inhibited by PQIP (Fig. 5A)
and IGF can drive pY612-IRS-1 in serum-starved cells (data not
shown). Previous reports have indicated that IRS-1-Y612 serves
as a docking node for p85-PI3K. Whereas PQIP had no effect on

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

pIRS-1-S636/639, we find that erlotinib could inhibit pIRS-1S636/639. S636/639 specifically has been reported to block IRS-1
function. Therefore, these data suggest that erlotinib might
potentiate IGF-IR signaling by enhancing the ability of IGF-IR to
couple to IRS-1.
Erk and p70S6K have been previously reported to phosphorylate IRS-1, and the activities for both can be inhibited by
erlotinib. We sought to determine if inhibition of Erk, p70S6K, or
both were involved in mediating the ability of erlotinib to affect
IRS-1 phosphorylation. We measured the ability of erlotinib or
rapamycin to affect pIRS-1-S636/639 for mesenchymal (NCI-H460
and Calu6) and epithelial (NCI-H292 and BxPC3) tumor cell
lines. Herein, we find that erlotinib can inhibit pIRS1-S636-639
only in the epithelial cell lines (Fig. 5B) consistent with our
observations of enhanced synergistic effects for its combination
with PQIP in epithelial, compared with mesenchymal, tumor cell
lines.
EGFR-activated Erk could relay signals through p70S6K,
thereby activating p70S6K by a rapamycin-insensitive mechanism, to enhance pIRS-1-S636-639. The ability of EGFR-activated
p70S6K to promote phosphorylation of IRS1-S636-639 and, in
turn, inhibit IGF-IR-IRS1 signaling would parallel a similar
negative regulatory feedback loop that has been proposed to
underlie the synergism observed for the combination of an
IGF-IR inhibitor and rapamycin. As an alternate mechanism,
EGFR-activated Erk could directly phosphorylate pIRS1-S636-639
(Fig. 6D). The ability of MAPK to phosphorylate IRS-1 in vitro
has been reported (30). In silico, we evaluated the propensity for
the IRS1-S636-639 sites to be phosphorylated by a panel of
kinases using the Scansite program (31). Scansite uses a
database obtained from profiling the consensus phosphorylation
patterns for a wide number of kinases and, thus, allows
prediction of kinase-substrate pairs. Among the evaluated
kinases, the sequence surrounding the IRS1-636-639 sites (PMSP)
ranks highest as a substrate for Erk and contains the PXSP Erkconsensus motif. We find that, although erlotinib was effective at
inhibiting pIRS1-S636-639, rapamycin had no measurable effect
in either the NCI-H292 or BxPC3 models. Rapamycin is effective
at inhibiting signals downstream of mTOR, including p70S6K
and S6, but does not affect activity for the MAPK pathway.
Therefore, we speculate that ability of erlotinib to block MAPK
pathway activity was likely associated with the inhibition of IRS1 serine phosphorylation. To validate this hypothesis, we treated
BxPC3 cells with a specific inhibitor of MEK, PD98059, and
monitored the phosphorylation status for pS-IRS-1 and pAkt. We
find that inhibition of downstream Erk by PD98059 was
accompanied by inhibition of pS-IRS-1, thus relieving a potential
inhibitory loop imposed on IGF-IR-IRS-1-PI3K signaling (Fig. 6A).
This generated an increase in Akt phosphorylation (T308 and
S473). The increase in pAkt, evoked by inhibition of the MAPK
pathway, could be blocked by PQIP (Fig. 6B), indicating that this
Akt activation was IGF-driven. These data suggest that the gain
in IGF-IR–directed Akt activity upon EGFR inhibition is likely
due, at least in part, to the release of a negative regulatory
feedback loop involving MEK-Erk-IRS-1 that would normally
attenuate IGF-IR.
To confirm that inhibition of the EGFR-MAPK pathway
mediated enhanced sensitivity to IGF-IR antagonism, we evaluated
the combination of PQIP and PD98059. This combination achieved
synergistic growth inhibition in all models evaluated (BxPC3,
NCI-H292, Colo205, and NCI-H460; Fig. 6C). Collectively, these

Feedback Mechanisms and EGFR and IGF-IR Cooperativity

results show how the ability of erlotinib to inhibit activity within
the MAPK pathway contributes to an increase in IGF-driven Akt
activity.

Discussion
Both IGF-IR and EGFR play key roles in the growth and
progression of solid tumors, and interactions between IGF-IR and
EGFR have been previously shown (8, 10, 14). EGFR inhibitors are
clinically approved for NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, SCCHN, and
CRC, and both antibody and small molecule inhibitors of IGF-IR
are currently in clinical development. Data suggests that the IGF-IR
pathway may be one of the key mechanisms for de novo and
acquired resistance to EGFR inhibition, and blockade of both
IGF-IR and EGFR functions may be required for optimal efficacy.
The translation of these preclinical observations to clinical efficacy
may require enrichment strategies based on biomarkers that
identify patients most likely to respond to this specific combination
of agents. Despite impressive preclinical data for the combination
of EGFR and IGF-IR inhibitors, the underlying molecular
mechanism that drives the success for this specific combination
of RTK inhibitors for selected tumor models, but not others, has
not yet been thoroughly described.
Herein, we describe the signal transduction mechanisms that
underlie cooperative EGFR and IGF-IR signaling. We used the low
molecular weight inhibitors of EGFR (erlotinib) and IGF-IR (PQIP)
as tools. Blockade of IGF-IR individually achieved growth
inhibition for a range of tumor types. Overall, epithelial tumor
cells achieved enhanced growth inhibition compared with those
that had undergone EMT. Seven of 28 tumor cells achieved
maximal growth inhibition >50% upon IGF-IR blockade, and these
were all epithelial. Dual blockade of EGFR and IGF-IR promoted
synergistic growth inhibition. Although treatment with singleagent inhibitors of these RTKs was predominately cytostatic,
treatment with the combination of EGFR and IGF-IR inhibitors
resulted in the induction of apoptosis, and these effects were
most prominent for epithelial, compared with mesenchymal,
tumor cells. Furthermore, statistically significant growth regression in vivo was achieved for the combination in epithelial
tumors, and in the NCI-H292 NSCLC model, about one third of
animals had durable cures.
Observations presented herein suggest that the expression of
EMT markers can be used to differentiate the sensitivities of tumor
cell lines to IGF-IR inhibitors, alone or in combination with an EGFR
inhibitor. For many of the tumor types addressed in this study
(NSCLC, pancreatic, etc.) the relative proportion of epithelial
to mesenchymal tumor cells within a given tumor is related to
disease stage, where stage 1 tumors are largely composed of epithelial tumor cells and there is rise in the proportion of mesenchymal tumor cells with increasing disease stage. Therefore, the
biomarker signature for IGF-IR inhibitor sensitivity, alone or in
combination with an EGFR inhibitor, seems to be confined to early
stage disease, a finding that is supported by recent histopathologic
data where IGF-IR overexpression was shown to be a poor prognostic indicator (HR > 3) for stage 1 but not for other stage (HR = 1)
NSCLC tumors (32).
We explored the mechanism of synergy for dual EGFR and IGF-IR
blockade in epithelial tumor cells. The ability of EGFR and IGF-IR to
cooperatively affect cell growth is unique to these specific RTKs, and
not other RTKs, in a panel of 42 evaluated, as only the activation
states for EGFR and IGF-IR were up-regulated in cells treated with

www.aacrjournals.org

the reciprocal inhibitors of these receptors. The observation
that inhibition of IGF-IR or EGFR results in rapid up-regulation
of the activity for the reciprocal receptors illustrates the
plasticity of tumor cells to evoke resistance to inhibition of a single
RTK.
RTKs may rely on overlapping cellular machinery to transduce
signals, and we investigated the mechanism responsible for cooperative control of growth and survival. Previous reports have shown
that EGFR directs activities within both the MAPK and Akt pathways in epithelial, but not mesenchymal-like, tumor cells. Herein,
we describe how Akt activity is cooperatively controlled by both
EGFR and IGF-IR. Inhibitors of both receptors could partially block
Akt activity transiently, and here, the combination achieved an additive inhibition of Akt activity. However, rapid resistance developed
such that inhibition of Akt by the single-agent EGFR or IGF-IR
inhibitors could not be fully sustained after prolonged treatment. By
24 hours, EGFR inhibitor treatment had conferred a potentiation of
IGF-driven Akt, and the combination of both EGFR and IGF-IR
antagonists synergistically inhibited Akt to drive apoptosis.
In addition to receptor reciprocity between EGFR and IGF-IR, we
find that disruption of EGFR-driven activity within the MAPK
pathway contributes to the potentiation of IGF-driven Akt
signaling, and this is likely mediated by augmented coupling of
IGF-IR to Akt through the IRS-1 adaptor. The ability of IRS-1
phosphorylation at selected serine sites to down-regulate activity is
well described (26–28). Previous reports have shown that
rapamycin can promote IGF-driven Akt activity by affecting a
negative feedback loop imposed on IGF-IR-IRS-1 signaling. Here,
blockade of the mTOR-p70S6K signaling pathway prevents serine
phosphorylation of IRS-1, thereby promoting IGF-IR-IRS-1 coupling
and enhanced capacity to activate the Akt pathway. In this study,
we find that blockade of activity within the MAPK pathway,
through either upstream inhibition of EGFR or downstream
inhibition of MEK, conferred a decrease in IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, promoting IGF-IR-Akt signaling. The synergism that occurs
upon dual EGFR and IGF-IR antagonism occurred only in epithelial
tumor cells, where EGFR directs the MAPK pathway. A specific
inhibitor of MEK evoked a similar decrease in pS-IRS-1 that was
associated with an increase in IGF-driven pAkt and accompanied
synergistic growth inhibition upon IGF-IR blockade. The ability of
the MAPK pathway to affect the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1
could be mediated either directly through Erk or indirectly through
the ability of Erk to transactivate p70S6K, as illustrated in Fig. 6D.
Previous reports have shown that Erk can phosphorylate IRS-1
in vitro, and the role of MAPK in feedback inhibition of insulin
signaling and insulin resistance has been previously noted (30). In
this manner, the mechanism underlying cooperative growth
inhibition achieved by combining an IGF-IR antagonist with an
EGFR antagonist or MEK antagonist parallels that for an IGF-IR
antagonist and rapamycin, where all circumvent negative regulatory feedback loops that converge on IRS-1.
