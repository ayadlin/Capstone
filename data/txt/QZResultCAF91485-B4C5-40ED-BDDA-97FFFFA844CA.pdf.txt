ABSTRACT
To obtain improved efficacy against pancreatic cancer, we investigated the
efficacy and safety of a locally-applied 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-loaded polymeric patch on
pancreatic tumors in an orthotopic nude-mouse model. The 5-FU-releasing polymeric
patch was produced by 3D printing. After application of the patch, it released the
drug slowly for 4 weeks, and suppressed BxPC-3 pancreas cancer growth. Luciferase
imaging of BxPC3-Luc cells implanted in the pancreas was performed longitudinally.
The drug patch delivered a 30.2 times higher level of 5-FU than an intra-peritoneal
(i.p.) bolus injection on day-1. High 5-FU levels were accumulated within one week
by the patch. Four groups were compared for efficacy of 5-FU. Drug-free patch as
a negative control (Group I); 30% 5-FU-loaded patch (4.8 mg) (Group II); 5-FU
i.p. once (4.8 mg) (Group III); 5-FU i.p. once a week (1.2 mg), three times (Group
IV). The tumor growth rate was significantly faster in Group I than Group II, III, IV
(p=0.047 at day-8, p=0.022 at day-12, p=0.002 at day-18 and p=0.034 at day-21).
All mice in Group III died of drug toxicity within two weeks after injection. Group II
showed more effective suppression of tumor growth than Group IV (p=0.018 at day12 and p=0.017 at day-21). Histological analysis showed extensive apoptosis in the
TUNEL assay and by Ki -67 staining. Western blotting confirmed strong expression
of cleaved caspase-3 in Group II. No significant changes were found hematologically
and histologically in the liver, kidney and spleen in Groups I, II, IV but were found
in Group III.

INTRODUCTION

manipulatable geometry which prevented tumor growth
in a subcutaneous mouse model [6]. However, orthotopic
models of pancreatic cancer are more patient-like since
they are growing in a pancreatic micro-environment rather
than a subcutaneous one [7-12].
In the present study, we investigated the efficacy
and safety of the locally-applied chemotherapeutic-drugloaded polymeric patch in an orthotopic murine pancreatic
cancer model.

More than 70% of operated pancreatic-cancer
patients develop local or metastatic recurrence after
attempted curative resection. Adjuvant chemotherapy has
been shown to be somewhat effective in recent clinical
trials, increasing the low median-survival rate two-fold
[1-5]. Improved therapy for this recalcitrant disease is
urgently needed.
Since the amount of residual cancer cells is not
large after pancreatic tumor resection, they can potentially
be effectively eradicated with a small drug dose if it is
properly delivered [6]. To improve adjuvant therapy of
pancreatic cancer, we have designed a chemotherapeutic
drug-loaded polymeric patch which can continuously
administer small doses.
In a previous report, we described a threedimensional printed (3DP) polymer patch loaded with
a chemotherapy agent with controlled release and a

In vivo degradation was analyzed by implanting the
patch onto the orthotopic pancreatic tumor and analyzed
by SEM from the resected tumor as shown in Figure 2B.
When the patch surface was examined by SEM three
weeks after implantation on the orthotopic pancreatic
tumor, we confirmed that the drug had been released
through the orifices in the patch (Figure 2).

shape and size of the patch are adjustable. The patch has
an average weight of 8 mg, a size of 10 × 5 mm. The patch
has a loop at each corner such that it can cover a tumor
which has a three-dimensional round shape. The patch
can be fixed at the desired site with suture. The surface of
the patch with or without 5-FU was imaged with scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 2).

In vitro efficacy of the patch on BxPC-3 cells

In vivo delivery of 5-FU to the pancreas by the
patch

The amount of 5-FU released from the patch in
vitro was measured using UV detection to verify the drug
release function of the patch (Figure 2C). The patches
weighed approximately 8 mg and were loaded with 30%
w/w of 5-FU which is equivalent to 2.4 mg of drug per
patch. The in-vitro release pattern of 5-FU showed an
early burst release of approximately 26% of the drug
within the first day. The drug was slowly released after
that. The amount of eluted drug from day 7 to 28 was
11-30 µg/ml (Figure 2C). BXPC-3 cell proliferation was
inhibited more than 60% compared to untreated cells after
four weeks (Figure 2D).

5-FU was injected (4.8 mg) i.p. once a week
and compared with 5-FU delivery in animals with the
patch. The pancreas was removed on days 1 and 8 after
drug treatment. The amount of 5-FU in the pancreas
was measured by liquid chromatography tandem-mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In animals with the 5-FUloaded patch, the 5-FU level in the pancreas was 2.56 ±
0.29 pg/mg on day 1; and 34.42 ± 8.12mg on day 8. In
animals with i.p. delivery of 5-FU, the amount of 5-FU in
the pancreas was 0.08 ± 0.02 pg/mg on day 1; and 0.01 ±
0.00 pg/mg on day 8. The patch delivered a much larger

site than i.p. delivery (Figure 2E) (p = 0.018 at day 1, p
= 0.024 at day 8). The 5-FU level in the blood had no
significant difference at day 1, between animals with patch
implantation and animals with bolus injection. However,
a small amount of 5-FU (0.01± 0.00) was detected in the
blood of a patch-implanted mouse at day 8.

In untreated mice and mice implanted with a drugfree patch, the orthotopic pancreatic cancer grew rapidly
as shown by non-invasive imaging (Figure 3). The Pearson

actual tumor volume and image-calculated volume was
0.857. These results show that tumor-volume calculations
obtained from the tumor image can reflect the actual tumor
volume and weight.
In mice treated with i.p. 5-FU, non-invasive
imaging showed continuous tumor-growth suppression
but it was not significantly different from the untreated
control (p = 0.132 at day 8, 0.057 at day 18 and 0.216
at day 21). When 4.8 mg 5-FU was injected i.p. once,
the growth of the pancreatic cancer was suppressed at
the beginning. However, most of the mice died after two
weeks, and the pancreatic cancer of one surviving mouse
showed increased tumor growth after two weeks. The
strongest tumor-suppression efficacy was with the patch
implantation compared to animals implanted with an
unloaded patch (Figure 4) (p = 0.031 at day 8, 0.002 at
day 18 and 0.015 at day 21).
At the end of the treatment period on day 21, tumors
were resected from mice in each group and tumor volume
and weight were directly measured. Both tumor weight
and volume were significantly inhibited by the drugloaded patch (p = 0.029 for volume and p = 0.035 for
weight). 5-FU delivered i.p. showed an inhibitory trend
for tumor volume and weight but there is no significant
difference (Figure 4D, 4E) for tumor volume (p = 0.434)
or for tumor weight (p = 0.891).

Most of the cells were stained with KI-67 and a few
of them stained with TUNEL assay in the tumors covered
with the sham patch (Figure 5A). In contrast, most cells
around the adhesive face of the patch were stained with
TUNEL in mice treated with the 5-FU-loaded patch and
they did not stain with KI-67. However, some parts of the
pancreatic cancer showed growth on the part of the tumor
where the patch could not reach. Western blotting showed
strong expression of cleaved caspase-3 indicating more
apoptosis in the patch group than the control group (p =
0.018) (Figure 5). The bolus-injection group also showed
a similar pattern as the mice with the drug-loaded patch.
However, in the bolus-treated mice, cells inside the tumor
were stained with KI-67 (Figure 5B).

Survival and hematological and histological

The experiment period was 28 days after cancer cell
inoculation, which is not sufficient for metastasis to occur
or to cause mouse death as a result of tumor growth. All

mice treated with the sham patch, 5-FU-loaded patch and
5-FU bolus injection with low dose survived until the end
of the experimental period. However, for the mice treated
with high-dose bolus 5-FU all died, except one, during
the experimental period due to drug overdose (Figure 6A).
All groups treated with 5-FU (patch and i.p.) showed
a slight decrease in hematological values. However, in the
high-dose (i.p.) group, most hematological factors such
as WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, etc., decreased more than
50%, especially reticulocytes, which showed a decrease
of more than 90% (Table 1). Histologically normal organs
showed no difference between mice treated with the drugloaded patch and untreated animals. However, the spleen
from a mouse injected with high dose 5-FU treated mouse
showed loss of lymphoid tissue, fibrosis, and accumulation
of iron pigment (Figure 6).
There was 33.5 times more 5-FU delivered to
the pancreas with the patch than with a bolus i.p. 5-FU
injection. With the patch, high levels of 5-FU remained
in the pancreas even after one week, and was 21.9 times
higher than bolus injection.
The orthotopic pancreatic cancer model is more
appropriate for the patch than subcutaneous models, as
the orthotopic mouse patch can be readily translated to
the clinic.
Previously-developed concepts and strategies of
highly-selective tumor targeting can take advantage of
molecular targeting of tumors, including tissue-selective
therapy which focuses on unique differences between
normal and tumor tissues [14-19].

and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) (lactide: glycolide
= 85:15, Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) at a ratio of 1:1 at
140°C. 5-FU powder was mixed with the polymer solution
at a 3:7 w/w ratio and loaded into the reservoir of a 3D
printer. The mixture solution was extruded from the
reservoir at 600 kPa in the printing head of an in-housemanufactured extrusion-based 3D printer with a multihead deposition system (MHDS) [10].

CONCLUSION

Quantitation of 5-FU-released in the pancreas
after patch implantation

Release profile of the 5-FU-loaded patch
The concentration of 5-FU released from the patch
in PBS was determined by measuring the absorbance at λ
= 265 nm using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Spectramax
190, molecular device, CA USA).

Efficacy of 5-FU-releasing solution in vitro
BxPC3-Luc cells (3x103) were seeded into 96well plates for 24 hours prior to treatment (n = 4). 5-FUreleasing medium or fresh complete culture medium
was added to the wells. After 48 hours treatment with
drug-releasing solution, cell viability was assessed
using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay (Dojindo
Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). The absorbance was
measured using a microplate reader at 450 nm (Sunrise,
TECAN, Switzerland). Cytotoxicity relative to control
was determined.

The results of the present study show that a polymer
patch constructed with 3D printing can release 5-FU for
more than four weeks after attachment to the pancreas.
Since the patch is directly attached to the organ, the 5-FU
concentration in the blood is negligible but very high in
the pancreatic tumor. The growth of pancreatic cancer
was arrested by the patch with minimal toxicity. 3DP
techniques have been previously demonstrated to produce
implants that have precisely defined, micro- and macro
architectures which can be applied effectively for complex
release of multiple types of drugs [20-25]. In the clinic,
the patch can be used after pancreatic cancer resection to
prevent recurrence.

5-FU-loaded (30%) patches in the pancreas of
BALC/c nude mice were attached to the pancreatic tumors
7-days after inoculation of BxPC3-Luc cells. 5-FU (1.2
mg), dissolved in PBS, was injected on the same day,
and 1.2 mg of the drug was once again injected a week
after the first injection for comparison with the patch.
The pancreas and serum were collected on the first day of
patch implantation or drug treatment and on day 8 of the
study as well.
Analysis of 5-FU was performed with a liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system
(LC-MS/MS). Glacial acetic acid (5 μl), ethyl acetate
(500 μl), and internal standard solution (0.001 mg/ml
5-bromouracil) (50 μl) were added to serum (50 μl) or
tissue (50 mg). For tissue, the sample was homogenized
using a TissueLyzer (Qiagen, Germany) and the
supernatant was collected after centrifugation. For serum,
the solution was mixed well for 5 min and centrifuged
at 10,000 rpm for 5 min (Centrifuge 5415R, Eppendorf,
Germany). The supernatant was transferred to a new
tube. The supernatant was dried under vacuum, then

stored at -20°C until analysis. The dried material was
reconstituted with acetonitrile (20 μl)/water/formic acid
(97/3/0.1, v/v/v) before LC-MS/MS analysis. A LC-MS/
MS system equipped with a 1290 HPLC (Agilent), Qtrap
5500 (ABSciex) and hydrophilic interaction column
(Shodex Asahipak NH2P-50 2D column (5 μm, 150 ×
2 mm), Phenomenex, USA) was used. The separation
gradient for 5-FU analysis used a mobile phase A (0.1%
formic acid in water) and mobile phase B (0.1% formic
acid in acetonitrile) and proceeded at 300 µl/min at
23°C. The separation gradient was as follows: hold at
3-40% A for 3 min; 40 to 50% A for 1.6 min; 50 to 80%
A for 1.4 min; hold at 80% A for 8 min; 80 to 0% A for
1 min; 0 to 3% A for 2 min and then hold at 3% A for
3 min. The multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode
was used in negative-ion mode, and the extracted-ion
chromatogram, corresponding to the specific transition
(128.8/42.1 for 5-FU; 188.7/42.1 for 5-bromouracil), was
used for quantification. The calibration range for 5-FU was
0.0001−10 ng/ml (r2 ≥ 0.99). The background level of the
untreated mice was used as a normalization control.

Two patches were fixed on the front and the back
of the pancreas so that the drug could be delivered
three-dimensionally (Figure 1B). Mice were randomly
divided into 4 groups at day 7 after orthotopic cancer-cell
inoculation; Group I: implanted with a drug-free patch
(sham patch); Group II: implanted with a 30% 5-FU-drugloaded patch (4.8 mg); Group III: 5-FU i.p. injection once
(4.8 mg); and Group IV: 5-FU i.p. injection once a week
(1.2 mg), three times. All experimental groups started
with n = 6 to 8 mice at the time of treatment initiation.
Patches were surgically fixed on the pancreatic tumor.
For i.p. injection, the 5-FU was dissolved in PBS and
slowly injected on day 7. In group III, 4.8 mg of 5-FU was
injected into the abdominal cavity once. In group IV, 1.2
mg of 5-FU dissolved in PBS was injected once a week
(day 0, 7, 14).

Optical imaging of the orthotopic pancreatic
tumor

Cell line
Mice were intraperitoneally injected with D-luciferin
(0.3 mg; Perkin Elmer Inc.). Whole-body luminescence
imaging with an IVIS Spectrum (Caliper Inc., Alameda,
CA) was performed every 3 minutes until radiance values
reached the maximum. The region of the interested (ROI)
level was measured with the radiance (photons/s/cm2/sr)
using an analysis program, Living Image 4.4 (Caliper Life
Sciences, PerkinElmer Inc.).

The BxPC3-Luc human pancreatic adenocarcinoma
cell line, transduced with luciferase, was cultured in
RPMI-1640 (RPMI; GIBCO) containing 10 % heatinactivation fetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO, MD,
USA) and 1 % Antibiotic-Antimycotic (AA; GIBCO,
MD, USA) in a humidified incubator at 37OC with 5% CO2
atmosphere. BxPC3-Luc cells were selected in multiple
steps and a clone was selected for high luciferase intensity.

Tumor measurement

Mice
The volume of the tumor was measured with
calipers after removal at the end of the experiment. Tumor
volume [mm3] = π/6 × (L) × (W) × (D). Tumors were also
weighed. Tumor weight or volume were correlated to
image size.

To prepare the xenograft mouse tumor model,
BALB/c nude mice (Orient Bio Inc., Sungnam, Korea)
were used (male, 6 weeks). All mouse experiments
within the guidelines of the protocol were reviewed by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Asan Institute for Life Science [11]. BxPC-3-Luc cells
were harvested (1×106) and resuspended in serum-free
RPMI-1640 (10 µl) medium mixed with Matrigel (2:3
ratio). After inhalational anesthesia with isoflurane, the
entire pancreatic body and spleen were exposed to the
outside of the peritoneal cavity using a blunt forceps, 10
µl cells (1×106) in a Matrigel suspension were injected
slowly using a 29 gauge syringe into the tail of the
pancreas. The needle was removed from the pancreas
and after a wait of 1-2 minutes, mice were inspected for
hemorrhage and leakage. The pancreas and spleen were
carefully repositioned back to the peritoneal cavity and
the abdominal wall was closed with a 6.0 vicryl suture and
abdominal skin closed using 5.0 black silk sutures [25].

Immunohistochemical staining
After sacrificing the mice at day 21, the tumors
were removed and fixed in 4% neutral-buffered paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin
blocks were cut into 4 µm sections and were reviewed
histologically after hematoxylin and eosin staining.
Paraffin sections were deparaffinized and then rehydrated.
After microwave antigen retrieval, non-specific binding
sites were blocked with PBS containing 10% normal
goat serum. The sections were further incubated with
the primary antibodies against Ki-67 (Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark) followed by an Alexa 488-conjugated
secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Danvers, Massachusetts, USA). TUNEL staining was

transplantation of sham patches. Mice were sacrificed
on day 7 and samples of blood were taken from the
abdominal vein. This experiment was performed in
triplicate. All external features and orifices were visually
examined and lesions which showed any abnormal
morphology were recorded. Blood samples were collected
for hematology determinations in tubes with EDTA-2 K
as an anticoagulant. Hematology determinations included
white-blood-cell (WBCs) count, red-blood-cell (RBC)
count, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit content,
platelet count, differential leucocyte count (neutrophils,
lymphocytes, monocytes), reticulocyte count, using an
Advia 120 Hematology analyzer (Bayer Healthcare,
Myerstown, PA, USA). The liver, spleen, and kidney, were
analyzed for toxicity histologically. All organs/tissues
were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and were
processed and trimmed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned
at a thickness of 4-6 µm, and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin for microscopic examination.

Western blotting
Protein samples were extracted from frozen
tumors removed from sacrificed mice at day 21. For
whole-lysate extraction, RIPA Lysis and Extraction
Buffer (Biosensing, Seongnam, Republic of Korea)
supplemented with a protease-inhibitor cocktail
(Complete Mini, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-free;
[Roche Diagnostics]) was used. The protein concentration
of each sample was determined using a BCA protein
assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein samples
were resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and were
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Trans-Blot®
Turbo™ nitrocellulose; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The
membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk
(AppliChem, Cheshire, CT, USA) in Tris-buffered saline
Tween-20 (TBST; pH 7.6; 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM
NaCl and 0.1 % Tween 20) at room temperature (24oC)
for 30 min and were incubated overnight at 4oC with
cleaved caspase-3 rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:1000
dilution, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA).
The membranes were then rinsed three times with TBST
(pH 7.6) for 10 min at room temperature and incubated
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated HRPconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000 dilution) (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at room
temperature for 1 hr with gentle agitation. Membranes
were washed five times with TBST (pH 7.6) for 30 min
at room temperature. Protein signals were detected
using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) solution
(SuperSignal™ West Femto; Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Images were captured using an ImageQuant LAS 4000
system (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ,
USA). The blots were stripped using Restore™ PLUS
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) stripping buffer and were
reprobed for β-actin (internal control) using the same
methods. Mouse monoclonal anti-human actin antibody
(1:20000 dilution, Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany)
was used as the primary antibody, and HRP-conjugated
goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) was used as the secondary antibody.

Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was determined using
GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA,
USA) for tumor analysis. Data were analyzed by Pearson
correlation for comparison of image size and tumor weight
or volume. Survival among the groups was analyzed using
the Log-Rank test for trend and pair-wise comparisons.
The statistical significance of the differences between
groups was analyzed with the Student’s t-test and a twoway analysis of variance. P < 0.05 indicates a statisticallysignificant difference. The data are presented as the
mean ± standard deviation, with the number of samples
indicated in the figure legends.
