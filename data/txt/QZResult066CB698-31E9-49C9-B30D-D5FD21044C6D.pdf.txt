Chemotherapeutic Resistance: Surviving Stressful
Situations
Luke A. Gilbert and Michael T. Hemann

Abstract
Chemotherapeutic regimens involve the systemic administration of genotoxic compounds that induce cancer
cell death via well-established DNA damage response signaling networks. Less understood is how the treatment
of other cell types within the tumor microenvironment affects the therapeutic response. Here we discuss recent
work that shows that tumor-adjacent cells can respond to genotoxic stress by activating a paracrine secretory
program. Although this secretory response serves to protect progenitor cells and promote tissue regeneration in
conditions of cellular stress, it can also be coopted by tumor cells to survive frontline chemotherapy. Thus, local
prosurvival signaling may present a fundamental barrier to tumor clearance by genotoxic agents, suggesting
that effective treatments need to target both cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. Cancer Res; 71(15);

Introduction
Tumor development and treatment occur in the context of
endogenous tissue, with neoplastic cells surrounded by a
diverse set of nontransformed cells and a heterogeneous
stromal compartment (1). In fact, for many tumors, the
stromal tissue constitutes the majority of the overall tumor
mass. Tumor cells interact with normal cells in the tumor
microenvironment through secreted and surface-bound proteins, and these interactions are critical for tumor progression.
For example, tumor–stromal interaction is essential for
numerous processes that occur during tumor development,
including neovascularization, immune surveillance and evasion, and metastasis. Further, it is well established that nonneoplastic cells in the tumor microenvironment secrete a
variety of factors that promote tumor cell survival and growth
during various stages of tumor development. Here we discuss
the emerging idea that the tumor microenvironment modulates the response to frontline cancer therapy.
Effective cancer therapy using surgery, radiotherapy, or
chemotherapy results in the absence of macroscopic disease
either at the site of the primary tumor or at common distal sites
of disease dissemination. However, despite this initial tumor
clearance, many patients who have undergone such therapy
will relapse (2). Thus, small cohorts of tumor cells can survive in
cryptic anatomic loci following therapy. These surviving cancer
cells represent minimal residual disease (MRD) (3). Patients in

disease remission can be further subclassified as MRD-positive
or -negative with the use of high-resolution tumor detection
techniques, including flow cytometry and PCR (4). Not surprisingly, patients who are MRD-positive have a significantly
poorer prognosis than those who are MRD-negative. Although
the persistence of residual disease is a well-established contributor to disease recurrence and treatment failure, preclinical
models of cancer therapy have generally failed to interrogate
how these cancer cells survive and relapse.
The mechanisms by which MRD survives chemotherapy
despite the effective elimination of bulk tumor cell populations
remain unclear (5). Tumor drug resistance is classically associated with cell-intrinsic processes, including apoptotic
defects, upregulation of multidrug efflux pumps, decreased
proliferation rate, and defects in DNA damage recognition
(6, 7). More recently, it has been suggested that cancer stem
or initiating cells are more resistant to conventional chemotherapy, and it is this population of tumor cells that fuels
disease relapse (8). However, these putative resistance
mechanisms for MRD have not been examined in relevant
therapeutic settings, largely due to the absence of established
preclinical models of MRD persistence. Thus, it is unclear
whether MRD survives therapy in a stochastic or cell-autonomous manner, or if response to therapy is specific to the
tumor microenvironment.

Key Findings
To investigate the mechanisms underlying the persistence
of MRD, we examined the response of lymphomas in a mouse
model of human Burkitt lymphoma, the Em-myc mouse, to
conventional chemotherapy (9). In this model, transplanted
lymphoma cells disseminate to all lymphatic tissues, including
the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and peripheral lymph
nodes. Following administration of doxorubicin [a frontline
therapy used as a component of treatment regimens for nearly

Paracrine Survival Signaling in the Tumor Microenvironment

all B-cell lymphomas (BCL)], the tumor cells underwent
apoptosis and were rapidly cleared from the lymph nodes,
spleen, and bone marrow. Strikingly, however, tumor clearance was not universal, as a large population of surviving
BCL cells persisted in the posttreatment thymus (10). These
findings suggest that drug efficacy can vary among distinct
tumor microenvironments.
Surviving thymic lymphoma cells in treated Em-myc mice
were critically important for tumor relapse and disease progression, as mice with physical or genetic ablation of the
thymus exhibited significantly longer tumor-free and overall
survival following therapy. Thus, in this model the thymus
represents a treatment-refractory tumor microenvironment
that supports the survival of a subset of lymphoma cells, a
phenomenon that parallels the persistence of MRD following
therapy. Of note, the thymic microenvironment promoted
lymphoma-cell drug resistance in a non–cell-autonomous
manner. Specifically, soluble factors in conditioned media
derived from the thymus, but not other primary lymphatic
tissue, conferred resistance to doxorubicin in vitro.
Studies in this system revealed an unexpected mechanism
for surviving genotoxic stress. Briefly, endothelial cells in the
tumor microenvironment responded to high levels of DNA
damage induced by conventional chemotherapy by activating
the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which initiates an
acute downstream secretory response involving multiple chemokines and cytokines. Two factors secreted by endothelial
cells, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Timp1, conferred resistance to
doxorubicin in lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Of importance, neither of these proteins affected the growth rate of
lymphoma cells, suggesting that this response is prosurvival
rather than promitogenic. The mechanism underlying the
specific induction of a DNA damage–induced secretory
response in endothelial cells in the thymus but not the peripheral lymph nodes or spleen remains unclear. One explanation may lie in the organ-specific heterogeneity and plasticity of
endothelial cells in both the vasculature and lymphatics (11).
Additionally, other resident cell types in the thymus may play a
contributing role in promoting MRD persistence and relapse
following therapy. Of interest, this specialized response to DNA
damage is relevant to stress-induced thymic homeostasis in the
absence of malignancy, as IL-6/ mice show impaired regeneration of the T-cell compartment following irradiation. Thus,
in this setting, chemotherapy induces a secretory response in
endothelial cells that can be coopted by tumor cells to avoid
DNA damage–induced apoptosis (Fig. 1).

Stress-Induced Secretory Phenotypes
In settings where chemotherapies show efficacy, druginduced antitumor activity occurs rapidly following therapeutic administration. Thus, for a secretory response to affect
therapeutic response, it must occur acutely. This is particularly true for hematopoietic malignancies, where tumor clearance frequently occurs within 24 to 48 hours of treatment. In
the thymus, release of IL-6 from both human and mouse
endothelial cells occurs within 24 hours of treatment, suggesting this secretory response is engaged rapidly enough to

www.aacrjournals.org

influence tumor response to DNA damage. This acute
stress–associated phenotype (ASAP) is distinct from reported
secretory phenotypes that are more indirectly engaged in
response to DNA damage, such as the senescence-associated
secretory phenotype (SASP; ref. 12). The SASP develops gradually over the course of 5 to 8 days and occurs only after
established markers of senescence are detected. However,
because apoptosis in treated hematopoietic cancers occurs
within 72 hours of treatment, a more rapid release of prosurvival factors would likely be essential to affect therapeutic
outcome. This does not preclude a SASP from influencing
therapeutic efficacy, but its relevance may be restricted to
settings such as metronomic chemotherapy, in which therapy
is applied in an ongoing manner over a period of days (13).
Thus, the ASAP represents a microenvironment-specific
stress response in which endothelial cells sense DNA damage
and acutely activate a cytoprotective secretory program,
protecting both normal and tumor cells in the thymus from
apoptosis. Of note, chemotherapeutics have been shown to
engage in acute protumorigenic processes in other settings.
For example, treatment with paclitaxel, but not gemcitabine,
can promote tumor angiogenesis through the mobilization
and recruitment of bone marrow–derived endothelial cells to
tumors (14, 15). This process is mediated by an acute drugmediated release of systemic SDF-1 and G-CSF. Thus, tumor
cells can coopt general stress-induced secretory responses
that presumably have evolved to promote normal tissue repair
and regeneration, to survive and progress after administration
of frontline chemotherapy.
The relevance of thymic tumor persistence in the Em-Myc
model to therapeutic response in human tumors remains
unclear. Of note, a subset of lymphoma patients present with
primary BCLs in the thymus. Mediastinal (thymic) diffuse
large BCL (Med-DLBCL) is a highly aggressive disease that
accounts for 5% to 10% of all DLBCLs (16). Med-DLBCL is
treated with conventional chemotherapeutic regimens, all of
which include anthracyclines such as doxorubicin. Although
the question of how Med-DLBCLs respond to frontline chemotherapy relative to other DLBCLs (17) remains somewhat
controversial, our data suggest that counteracting IL-6 function may improve Med-DLBCL patient outcome.

Prosurvival Signals in Tissue Homeostasis and
Development, and Cancer
The tumor microenvironment can present multiple barriers
to effective cancer treatment. Perhaps the best established of
these mechanisms are physical barriers to drug delivery. These
include the classic problem of delivering drugs across the
blood–brain barrier, as well as decreased drug accessibility in
solid tumors due to negative interstitial fluid pressure in the
tumor, aberrant tumor vasculature, or fibrosis (18). Less
understood is how paracrine factors from stromal, immune,
or endothelial cells promote cancer cell resistance to apoptosis (19). In this section, we focus on physiologic prosurvival
signals in various anatomic contexts, with an emphasis on the
IL-6 pathway.

Figure 1. A diagram showing microenvironment-specific responses to frontline chemotherapy. Left, systemic chemotherapy can effectively clear the
majority of lymphoid tumor cells. Right, genotoxic damage can also induce organ- and cell-type–specific stress responses. Paracrine prosurvival signaling in
select tumor microenvironments can counter the efficacy of anticancer agents, leading to the persistence of MRD.

The concept of prosurvival signaling is well described in
developmental biology and occurs during both adult and
embryonic development. For example, during B-cell development, IL-7 is critically required for cell survival during the
transition of pre-pro to pro B cells (20). Other paracrine
signals, such as the Notch, Wnt, and Hedgehog pathways,
similarly support self-renewal and repopulation of stem or
progenitor populations in the skin, blood, gut, and nervous
system (21). In fact, metazoans have developed many evolutionarily conserved processes to modulate and repair tissues,
ensuring the survival of the organism even when widespread
cell death occurs in a tissue (22). These processes can be
activated by diverse physiologic stresses, including ischemia,
wounds, and pathogens. For example, Notch signaling from
endothelial cells within the bone marrow is required for
hematopoietic stem cell renewal and repopulation following
irradiation (23). Additionally, it has long been appreciated that
wounds or infections induce inflammation in which numerous
cytokines are secreted locally and systemically (24). Indeed,
this cytokine release is required for immune and stromal cell
recruitment and activation of processes required for physio-

logic tissue restoration. Here, IL-6 is a critical prosurvival
signal that is induced acutely following tissue injury and acts
primarily to activate immune cells.
Emerging literature suggests that IL-6 can act as a potent
prosurvival signal in many contexts. For example, viral IL-6
encoded by Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) promotes
B-cell survival following KSHV infection (25). IL-6 is also
required for liver regeneration, as shown by the fact that
IL-6/ mice die due to massive necrosis following partial
hepatectomy (26). Here again, survival signaling must be
acute, as mortality occurs within 24 hours of liver damage
in IL-6/ animals. In cancer, the IL-6/Jak/Stat signaling
pathway is frequently activated by overexpression or activating mutations. In hepatocellular adenomas, lymphomas, and
the myeloproliferative disorders polycythemia vera, essential
thrombocythemia, and idiopathic myelofibrosis, most
patients contain activating mutations in gp130, MYD88, or
Jak2, which induce high levels of Jak/Stat signaling and drive
proliferation (27–29). Furthermore, our data and those of
others indicate that IL-6 can induce upregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Thus, IL-6 is a potent

Paracrine Survival Signaling in the Tumor Microenvironment

prosurvival factor that can affect both tumorigenesis and
response to tissue injury.

Enhancing Chemotherapeutic Efficacy by
Targeting Prosurvival Signaling
The idea that tissue damage associated with chemotherapy can activate a paracrine prosurvival secretory program
suggests that inhibition of signaling pathways activated by
IL-6 might potentiate the therapeutic efficacy of conventional anticancer agents. In the Em-Myc model, we tested
whether chemical inhibition of Jak kinase activity, a downstream mediator of both IL-6 and Timp-1 signaling, could
potentiate the action of doxorubicin. Mice treated with a
pan-JAK inhibitor and doxorubicin showed significantly
longer tumor-free and overall survival than mice treated
with doxorubicin alone. Of importance, mice subjected to
IL-6 pathway inhibition showed no tumor regression or
difference in overall survival when compared with vehicle
control. Thus, simply blocking a prosurvival signal may not
be an effective therapy in the absence of DNA damage.
Consequently, determining whether a microenvironmentspecific cytokine functions as a mitogen or a survival factor
is critical for determining whether a targeted agent should
be used as a monotherapy or applied in combination with
conventional chemotherapies.
Such combination therapies may be particularly important
in cancers such as multiple myeloma (30). IL-6 is a tonic
prosurvival factor for cultured multiple myeloma cells, such
that IL-6 inhibition leads to cell death. However, clinical trials
that used IL-6–neutralizing antibodies alone showed no survival benefit (31). In this malignancy, exogenous stress (culture
stress or DNA damage) may be required to reveal a dependency on prosurvival signaling. Thus, although IL-6 neutralizing antibodies are not effective as single agents, combining
them with high-dose chemotherapeutic regimens could
improve tumor clearance in a variety of tumor types. The
value of such combination regimens may hold true for both
conventional chemotherapeutics and emerging targeted
therapies. For example, recent work showed improved antitumor activity when IL-6 inhibition was combined with the
administration of targeted therapy for the treatment of a
mouse model of lung cancer (32). Additionally, inhibition of
prosurvival cytokine signaling was shown to improve the
efficacy of the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib in the treatment
of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (33).
Clues to additional tumor types that may similarly coopt IL-6
signaling following systemic DNA damage may come from an
examination of nontransformed tissues that respond to IL-6
signaling. The IL-6 receptor is only expressed on hematopoietic
cells and hepatocytes, and it is these two cell types that activate
the majority of physiologic responses to IL-6 induction during
inflammation (34). Furthermore, IL-6 promotes the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in response to chemical
carcinogenesis in mice and underlies the gender disparity
observed in HCC in humans (35). Of note, HCCs are highly
treatment-refractory, yet doxorubicin treatment is the major
treatment modality in unresectable disease. Additionally, a

www.aacrjournals.org

poor prognosis in HCC is strongly associated with a paracrine
stromal IL-6 signature (36). These data suggest that perhaps, as
in the Em-myc model, inhibition of IL-6 signaling could promote
drug sensitivity in this tumor type.
Thus, it remains to be tested whether inhibition of acute
prosurvival secretory phenotypes can promote the cytotoxic activity of conventional chemotherapeutic agents in a
variety of cancers in humans. In the future, a central
component of investigating this process will be rapid
examination of posttreatment tumor microenvironments.
Most studies that examine cytokine and chemokine levels
in tumor biopsies report on steady-state concentrations in
the absence of treatment, an environment that may be
drastically altered in the presence of chemotherapy. Here,
the analysis of tumor samples subjected to neoadjuvant
treatment prior to surgery may provide key information
regarding the impact of chemotherapy on the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, the application of frontline
therapies to a range of existing genetically engineered
mouse models of cancer would allow for a temporal analysis of dynamic changes in the tumor microenvironment
that accompany drug treatment.

Conclusions
Tumors can relapse despite months to years of sustained
remission following therapy. Thus, understanding how subsets
of cancer cells survive treatment and where they persist during
this period of remission are fundamental questions in cancer
biology. It has long been appreciated that tumor initiation and
progression involve a complex set of interactions between
tumor cells and their associated stroma. The studies described
in this review suggest that the tumor microenvironment also
plays an integral role in overall therapeutic response. This is
perhaps not surprising given the striking difficulties of treating
tumors in their native setting versus treating tumor cells in
culture. Nevertheless, this work highlights the emerging relevance of developmental biology and tissue homeostasis to the
response to anticancer therapies. Understanding how cancers
coopt developmental survival cues will be essential for the
development of combination therapies that can achieve effective and durable treatment outcomes.
