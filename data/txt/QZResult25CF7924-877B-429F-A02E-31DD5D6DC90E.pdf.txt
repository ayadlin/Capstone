Abstract
Tumor-targeting immunocytokines represent a new class of
anticancer pharmaceutical agents, which often display a
superior therapeutic index compared with the corresponding
unconjugated cytokines. In this article, we have studied the
anticancer properties of interleukin-15 (IL-15) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), fused to
the human antibody fragment scFv(L19), specific to the EDB
domain of fibronectin, a marker of angiogenesis. The
immunocytokines L19-IL-15 and L19-GM-CSF were expressed
in mammalian cells and purified to homogeneity, revealing no
loss of cytokine activity in in vitro assays. Furthermore, the
ability of the two immunocytokines to selectively localize to
tumors in vivo was confirmed by biodistribution analysis with
radioiodinated protein preparations. L19-IL-15 and L19-GMCSF displayed a potent antitumor activity both in s.c. and in
metastatic F9 and C51 murine models of cancer in immunocompetent mice. This therapeutic action was superior
compared with IL-15–based and GM-CSF–based fusion proteins, containing antibodies of irrelevant specificity in the
mouse, which were used as non–tumor-targeting controls. For
both L19-IL-15 and L19-GM-CSF immunocytokines, CD8+ T
cells seemed to mostly contribute to the therapeutic action as
shown by in vivo cell depletion experiments. The results
presented in this article are of clinical significance, considering the fact that the sequence of EDB is identical in mouse and
man and that the tumor-targeting ability of the L19 antibody
has been extensively shown in clinical trials in patients with
cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(10):4940–8]

Introduction
Many proinflammatory recombinant cytokines display potent
anticancer activities, but their preclinical and clinical use is often
limited by the fact that unacceptable toxicities can be
encountered already at very low cytokine doses, preventing
escalation to therapeutically active concentrations. In most cases,
cytokines do not preferentially accumulate at the tumor site
following i.v. administration. For this reason, the antibody-based
targeted delivery of cytokines to the tumor environment seems to
be a promising strategy for enhancing the therapeutic index of
these potent anticancer agents (1, 2). The targeted delivery of

bioactive agents to the tumoral neovasculature seems to be a
particularly promising anticancer therapeutic modality, considering the fact that a vigorous neovasculature development is a
characteristic feature of aggressive solid tumors and that tumor
blood vessels are readily accessible for i.v. administered therapeutic agents (2, 3).
The EDB domain of fibronectin is one of the best-characterized
markers of angiogenesis described so far (4, 5). This 91-amino
acid domain is typically absent in human plasma and in normal
adult tissues (exception made for the endometrium in the proliferative phase and some vessels in the ovaries) but is strongly
expressed in most aggressive solid tumors, with a prominent
vascular and/or stromal pattern of staining (6, 7). EDB is
identical in sequence between mouse and man, thus facilitating
preclinical studies in the syngenic immunocompetent setting.
Furthermore, the tumor-targeting ability of the high-affinity
human antibody L19 (8), specific to EDB, has been well established
both in animal models of cancer (9–15) and in patients with solid
tumors (16).
A recombinant fusion protein, consisting of the L19 antibody in
scFv format fused to human interleukin (IL)-2 (17, 18), is
currently being investigated in multicenter phase II clinical
studies in Italy and Germany. Furthermore, the L19 antibody in
SIP format radiolabeled with iodine-131 (12, 13, 15) is being
investigated in phase II radioimmunotherapy clinical trials,
whereas a recombinant fusion protein between L19 and human
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is entering clinical studies for
applications in oncology.
The L19 antibody is one of the best-characterized antibodies in
terms of number of therapeutic derivatives, which have been tested
in preclinical models of cancer for their therapeutic activity and in
biodistribution studies. L19 derivatives include fusions to procoagulant factors (19), enzymes (20), charged proteins (21, 22), and
cytokines, such as IL-2 (17, 18), TNF (23–25), vascular endothelial
growth factors (26), IL-12 (24, 27, 28), IFN-g (29), and IL-10 (30).
Furthermore, the L19 antibody has been chemically coupled to
radionuclides (9–15), photosensitizers (31, 32), and drugs with
cleavable linkers.1 Among these derivatives, L19-cytokine fusion
proteins possibly represent the most promising class of anticancer
therapeutic agents.
To explore the anticancer potential of immunocytokines using
antibodies of proven tumor-targeting ability, such as L19, it is
imperative to continue expanding our investigations to a larger set
of cytokines. In fact, L19-cytokine fusions have displayed therapeutic activities in incurable models of murine cancer, thus justifying
the ongoing clinical development programs. Furthermore, different

Anticancer Activity of IL-15 and GM-CSF Immunocytokines

L19-cytokine fusions display different tumor-targeting performance
in vivo when assessed by quantitative biodistribution studies. These
investigations shed light on the molecular determinants, which
result in efficient in vivo targeting. Finally, different L19-cytokine
fusions often display potent anticancer activity using different
mechanisms of action and may display synergistic therapeutic
effects when used in combination.
In this study, we have investigated the anticancer therapeutic
properties of IL-15 and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF), fused to the L19 antibody in scFv format.
IL-15 is a potent proinflammatory cytokine, whose mechanism
of action partially overlaps with the one of IL-2. Both cytokines
stimulate the proliferation of T cells, induce the generation of CTLs,
facilitate the proliferation of and the synthesis of immunoglobulin
by B cells, and induce the generation and persistence of natural
killer (NK) cells (33). However, in many adaptive immune
responses, IL-2 and IL-15 have distinct and often competing roles.
IL-2, through its unique role in activation-induced cell death and
its participation in maintenance of peripheral Treg cells, is involved
in the elimination of self-reactive T cells. By contrast, IL-15 is
important in the maintenance of long-lasting, high-avidity T-cell
responses and it achieves this by supporting the survival of CD8+
memory T cells. Therefore, IL-15 might be a better choice than IL-2
for fusion with the vascular tumor-targeting antibody L19 and for
the treatment of cancer.
GM-CSF is a cytokine associated with the growth and
differentiation of hemopoietic cells. Furthermore, it is a potent
immunostimulator with pleiotropic effects, including the augmentation of antigen presentation in a variety of cells, increased
expression of MHC class II on monocytes and adhesion molecules
on granulocytes and monocytes, and amplification of T-cell
proliferation (34–36). Previous work by the Penichet and Morrison
groups (36) had shown that a recombinant fusion between an IgG
specific to HER-2/neu and GM-CSF can induce a substantial
growth retardation for mouse tumor cells stably transfected with
the human HER-2/neu gene (37). Furthermore, recombinant human
GM-CSF (Leukine) is a pharmaceutical product, which is indicated
for use following induction of chemotherapy in patients with acute
myelogenous leukemia to shorten time to neutrophil recovery and
to reduce the incidence of severe and life-threatening infections.
Additionally, it is used in multiple stem cell transplantation settings
for acceleration of myeloid recovery.
Both L19-IL-15 and L19-GM-CSF were expressed in mammalian
cells and purified to homogeneity. The two immunocytokines were
shown to be active in vitro and to target tumors in vivo.
Furthermore, both fusion proteins displayed a substantial anticancer activity in both s.c. and metastatic tumors in syngeneic
immunocompetent murine models of cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell Lines and Reagents
The tumor cell lines used were F9 murine teratocarcinoma (38) and C51
murine colon carcinoma (39). The mutated F9 murine teratocarcinoma cell
line (adapted to grow in cell culture flasks without 0.1% gelatin) was kindly
provided by Dario Rusciano (Sifi, Sicily, Italy; ref. 40). The HEK-293 cell line,
the CTLs line 2 (CTLL-2) cell line, the MC/9 cell line, and the two hybridoma
cell lines GK1.5 and 2.43 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection.
Recombinant human IL-15 (huIL-15) was obtained from eBioscience and
murine GM-CSF (muGM-CSF) was from Sigma. PNGase F for deglycosylation was purchased from New England Biolabs.

Cloning of L19-IL-15, IL-15-L19, L19-GM-CSF, HyHEL10IL-15, and HyHEL10-GM-CSF
For cloning of L19-IL-15, IL-15-L19, and HyHEL10-IL-15, the huIL-15 gene
was amplified from a commercial cDNA panel (Clontech) by PCR using the
primer pairs IL-15-back (5¶-ATGAGAATTTCGAAACCACATTTGAGAAGTATTTCC-3¶) and IL-15-for (5¶-AGAAGTGTTGATGAACATTTGGACAATATGTAC-3¶). The resulting fragment was then further amplified using
the primers link-IL-15-back (5¶-TCGGGTAGTAGCTCTTCCGGCTCATCGTCCAGCGGCAACTGGGTGAATGTAATAAGTGATTTG-3¶), appending a part of
the 15-amino acid linker (SSSSG)3 to the NH2 terminus, used later on for the
joining of scFv and the cytokine, and His-IL-15-for (5¶-TCATTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGAGAAGTGTTGATGAACATTTGGACAA-3¶), introducing
a His6 tag and stop codon to the COOH terminus of the IL-15 gene. With an
additional PCR using the primer Not-His-for (5¶-TTTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCTCATTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTG-3¶), the NotI restriction site was
appended to the COOH terminus of the cytokine.
To obtain the fusion proteins in a noncovalent homodimeric format, the
linker between heavy and light chain of the already existing scFvs (L19) and
(HyHEL10) had to be shorten to 5 amino acids (GSSGG). Therefore, the
genes for the VH of scFv(L19) and scFv(HyHEL10) were coamplified with a
signal peptide using primer pairs HindIII-sp-back (5¶-CCCAAGCTTGTCGACCATGGGCTGGAGCC-3¶) and linker-L19 VH for (5¶-TTCACCGCCACTGGACCCACTCGAGACGGTGACCAGGGTTCC-3¶) and linker-HH10 VH for
(5¶-ACCGCCACTGGACCCTGAGGAGACGGTGACCGTGGTCC-3¶), respectively, introducing a portion of the 5-amino acid linker (GSSGG) at the
COOH terminus of the heavy chain. The corresponding VLs were amplified
using the primer pairs linker-L19 VL ba (5¶-GTCTCGAGTGGGTCCAGTGGCGGTGAAATTGTGTTGACGCAGTCTCCAGGCA-3¶) and link-L19-for
(5¶-GAGCCGGAAGAGCTACTACCCGATGAGGAAGATTTGATTTCCACCTTGGTCCCTTG-3¶) and linker-HH10 VL ba (5¶-GTCTCCTCAGGGTCCAGTGGCGGTGACATTGTGCTGACCCAGCCTCCAG-3¶) and link-HH10-for
(5¶-GAGCCGGAAGAGCTACTACCCGATGAGGAAGATTTTATTTCCAGCTTGGTCCCC-3¶), respectively, appending the complementary part of
the GSSGG linker at the NH2 terminus of the light chain and a part of the
15-amino acid linker (SSSSG)3 sequence at the COOH terminus. The heavy
and light chains of the scFvs were assembled by PCR followed by the
assembly of the antibody and the cytokine gene portions. The assembled
L19-IL-15 and HyHEL10-IL-15 genes were cloned into the mammalian cell
expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) using the HindIII and NotI sites
of the vector.
The fusion protein IL-15-L19 was cloned with the same secretion
sequence as L19-IL-15. Therefore, the secretion sequence was first amplified
with the primer pair HindIII-SP-back long (5¶-CCCAAGCTTGTCGACCATGGGCTGGAGCC-3¶) and SP-IL-15 for (5¶-TCAAATCACTTATTACATTCACCCAGTTCGAGTGCACACCTGT-3¶), and afterwards, PCR was assembled
with the IL-15 gene preamplified with the primers SP-IL-15 back (5¶-TTCTCTCCACAGGTGTGCACTCGAACTGGGTGA-3¶) and linker-IL-15 for (5¶-GAGCCGGAAGAGCTACTACCCGATGAGGAAGAAGAAGTGTTGATGAACATTTGGACAATATGT-3¶). This PCR product was further fused to the
scFv(L19) gene with the 5-amino acid linker in between VH and VL, digested,
and cloned into the HindIII/NotI double-digested pcDNA3.1 vector.
For the cloning of L19-GM-CSF and HyHEL10-GM-CSF, a similar strategy
was followed. First, the muGM-CSF gene was amplified from a commercial
cDNA library (Clontech) using the primer pair GM-CSF-back (5¶-GCACCCACCCGCTCACCCATCAC-3¶) and GM-CSF-for (5¶-TTTTTGGACTGGTTTTTTGCATTCAAAGGG-3¶). Afterwards, the GM-CSF gene was further
elongated with the primers link-GM-CSF-back (5¶-TCGGGTAGTAGCTCTTCCGGCTCATCGTCCAGCGGCGCACCCACCCGCTCACCCAT-3¶) and HisGM-CSF-for (5¶-TCATTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGTTTTTGGACTGGTTTTTTGCATTC-3), which appended a part of the 15-amino acid linker
(SSSSG)3 at the NH2 terminus and a His6 tag with stop codons at the COOH
terminus. With an additional PCR using the primer Not-His-for (5¶-TTTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCTCATTAATGGTGATGGTGATGGTG-3¶), the NotI restriction site at the COOH terminus of the cytokine was introduced. Then, the
elongated GM-CSF gene was assembled to either the monomeric format of
the scFv(L19) with the 14-amino acid linker in between VH and VL or the
diabodic format of the scFv(L19) and scFv(HyHEL10) (described above) and

cloned into the mammalian cell expression vector pcDNA3.1(+) using the
HindIII and NotI sites of the vector.

Expression and Purification of L19-IL-15, IL-15-L19,
L19-GM-CSF, HyHEL10-IL-15, and HyHEL10-GM-CSF
HEK-293 cells were stably transfected with the previously described
plasmids and selection was carried out in the presence of G418 (0.5 g/L).
Clones of G418-resistant cells were screened for expression of the fusion
protein by ELISA using recombinant EDB domain of human fibronectin or
lysozyme as antigens and an anti-His6 tag antibody (Sigma) for detection as
described. The fusion proteins were purified from cell culture medium by
affinity chromatography over antigen columns as described previously
(9, 41). The size of the fusion proteins was analyzed in reducing and
nonreducing conditions on SDS-PAGE and in native conditions by fast
protein liquid chromatography gel filtration on a Superdex S-200 size
exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Deglycosylation
To deglycosylate purified L19-IL-15 and IL-15-L19, 40 Ag protein was
incubated with 2,500 units PNGase F for 20 h at 37jC.

Bioactivity Assay
Cytokine activity of L19-IL-15, IL-15-L19, and HyHEL10-IL-15 was
determined by doing a colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) dye reduction assay on CTLL-2 (42).
CTLL-2 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at the concentration of 5  104
per well in 200 AL of complete medium containing varying amounts of
huIL-15 standard or the fusion proteins at a maximum of 10 ng/mL IL-15
equivalents and serial dilutions. After 72 h, 20 AL of 5 mg/mL MTT (Sigma)
in PBS were added to each well. After 2 to 4 h, the plate was centrifuged and
cells were lysed with DMSO (Fluka) and read for absorbance at 570 nm. The
experiment was done in quadruplicates.
The cytokine activity of monomeric and homodimeric L19-GM-CSF as
well as HyHEL10-GM-CSF was determined by doing a proliferation assay on
murine mast cells MC/9 (43). Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at the
concentration of 5  103 per well in 200 AL of complete medium containing
varying amounts of recombinant muGM-CSF standard or the fusion
proteins at a maximum of 5 ng/mL GM-CSF equivalents and serial
dilutions. After 72 h, 20 AL of 5 mg/mL MTT in PBS were added to each well.
After 2 to 4 h, the plate was centrifuged and cells were lysed with DMSO and
read for absorbance at 570 nm. The experiment was done in triplicates.

Metastatic Tumor Models

Liver metastases. Male 129SvEv mice were injected i.v. with 5  105
mutant F9 murine teratocarcinoma cells (40). Three days after tumor cell
implantation, mice were divided into three groups (n z 5) and injected i.v
with 75 Ag L19-IL-15 or 75 Ag L19-GM-CSF thrice every second day. Mice
were sacrificed after 3 weeks, the livers were excised, pictures were taken,
and metastatic foci per liver were counted.
Lung metastases. Female BALB/c mice were injected i.v. with 105 C51
murine colon adenocarcinoma cells. Three days after tumor cell
implantation, mice were divided into three groups (n z 5) and injected
i.v. with 75 Ag L19-IL-15 and 75 Ag L19-GM-CSF. Injections were repeated
thrice every second day. Mice were sacrificed after 3 weeks; the lungs were
removed, fixed in saline containing 3% formaldehyde, and examined with a
Zeiss steromicroscope. Results are expressed as numbers of metastatic foci
per lung.

In vivo Depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T Cells
Anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and anti-CD8 mAb were
obtained by growing hybridoma cells (GK1.5 and 2.43, respectively) in
serum-free medium followed by purification on protein G-Sepharose
(Amersham). Mice were injected i.p. with anti-CD4 mAb (200 Ag) and antiCD8 mAb (200 Ag) on days 6, 2, 1, 5, 8, 12, 15, and 18 after s.c.
inoculation with 106 F9 cells. Selective depletion was confirmed by specific
staining of single spleen cell suspension using a FACSCanto flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson) on days 0 and 19. On day 5 after s.c.
tumor cell implantation, mice were grouped (n z 5) and therapy was
started. L19-IL-15 and L19-GM-CSF were injected thrice every second day
at a dose of 75 Ag immunocytokine per injection.

Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as the mean F SE. Differences in tumor volume
between different populations of mice were compared using Student’s t test.
P values <0.05 were considered to be significant.

Results

Biodistribution Experiments
The in vivo targeting performance was evaluated by biodistribution
analysis as described before (14, 17). Briefly, purified L19-IL-15, IL-15-L19,
and L19-GM-CSF were radioiodinated and injected into the tail vein of
immunocompetent 129SvEv mice bearing s.c. implanted F9 murine
teratocarcinoma. Mice were sacrificed 24 h after injection (2 Ag, 6 ACi for
L19-IL-15; 2.5 Ag, 5 ACi for IL-15-L19; and 2 Ag, 2 ACi for L19-GM-CSF/
mouse). Radioiodinated immunocytokines were also studied alone or mixed
with a molar excess of unlabeled (‘‘cold’’) protein to evaluate the dose
dependency of the tumor-targeting properties of L19-GM-CSF and L19-IL-15.
Organs were weighed and radioactivity was counted with a Packard
Cobra gamma counter. Radioactivity content of representative organs was
expressed as the percentage of the injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g).

Tumor Mouse Models
Tumor-bearing mice were obtained by injecting s.c. 106 F9 murine
teratocarcinoma cells in 10- to 12-week-old female 129SvEv mice or 106 C51
murine colon adenocarcinoma cells in 10- to 12-week-old female BALB/c
mice, respectively. All mice were purchased from Charles Rivers
Laboratories.
Normally, 4 to 5 days after tumor cell implantation, when tumors were
clearly palpable, mice were grouped (n z 4) and injected i.v. into the lateral
tail vein with saline, 75 Ag L19-IL-15 (corresponding to 25 Ag IL-15),
75 Ag IL-15-L19 (= 25 Ag IL-15), 75 Ag HyHEL10-IL-15 (= 25 Ag IL-15), 75 Ag
L19-GM-CSF (corresponding to 30 Ag GM-CSF), and HyHEL10-GM-CSF
(= 30 Ag GM-CSF) in a maximum volume of 300 AL.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

Mice were monitored daily and tumor growth was measured with a
caliper using the following formula: volume = length  width2  0.5.
Animals were sacrificed when tumor reached a volume >2,000 mm3 or when
tumors got necrotic according to Swiss regulations and under a project
license granted by the Veterinäramt des Kantons Zürich (198/2005). Tumor
sizes are expressed as mean F SE.

Cloning and expression of immunocytokines containing IL15 or GM-CSF. To improve the pharmacokinetic properties of our
scFv-cytokine fusion proteins in biodistribution and therapy
studies, the noncovalent homodimeric form (‘‘diabody’’) of the
immunocytokines was chosen. This format increases the size of the
immunocytokines over the renal threshold and shows increased
avidity due to its bivalent nature.
The sequential fusion of the scFv(L19) gene with the GM-CSF
gene yielded an immunocytokine, which coexisted in a monomeric
and noncovalent homodimeric form (Fig. 1A). Shortening the
scFv(L19) linker from a 14-amino acid peptide to a 5-amino acid
GSSGG sequence resulted, as expected (44, 45), in the formation of
a stable homodimeric immunocytokine (Fig. 1B). A similar strategy
was followed to fuse IL-15 at the COOH terminus or at the NH2
terminus of the scFv(L19) in diabody format with the GSSGG linker,
yielding the immunocytokines L19-IL-15 (Fig. 1C) and IL-15-L19
(Fig. 1D), respectively. Only the homodimeric immunocytokines
were later used for in vivo experiments.
Following similar experimental approaches, we used scFv(HyHEL-10), an antibody fragment specific to hen egg lysozyme
as an antibody of irrelevant specificity in the mouse, for the
construction of immunocytokines, which were used as negative
controls in tumor therapy experiments.

The fusion proteins were cloned and expressed in stably
transfected HEK-293 cells and purified to homogeneity by affinity
chromatography on antigen columns (Fig. 1).
Activity assays of huIL-15 and muGM-CSF. The biological
activity of huIL-15 and muGM-CSF was determined by their ability
to induce proliferation of the cytokine-dependent cell lines CTLL-2
and MC/9, respectively, using the colorimetric MTT dye reduction
assay.
Figure 2A shows that only the COOH-terminal fusions of scFv
and IL-15 displayed EC50 values comparable with the one of
recombinant huIL-15 when tested for their ability to proliferate the
cytokine-dependent CTLL-2 cells, whereas the immunocytokine
IL-15-L19 showed no biological activity at all.
L19-IL-15 and IL-15-L19 were deglycosylated with PNGase F
(an amidase that cleaves between the innermost GLcNAc and
asparagine residues from N-linked glycoproteins) to assess if their
different glycosylation state could influence their different in vitro
behavior. Both immunocytokines L19-IL-15 and IL-15-L19 had
the same size after deglycosylation as confirmed by SDS-PAGE
analysis (Fig. 2B), and the deglycosylated IL-15-L19 was active in
the CTLL-2 proliferation assay (Fig. 2C).

The biological activity of all GM-CSF immunocytokines was
comparable with the one of the recombinant cytokine in the MC/9
cell proliferation assay (Fig. 2D).
Biodistribution studies. The tumor-targeting ability of L19-IL15, IL-15-L19, and L19-GM-CSF was tested by quantitative
biodistribution analysis in 129SvEv mice bearing s.c. F9 tumors
using i.v. injections of radioiodinated protein preparations. L19-IL15 displayed a preferential accumulation at the tumor site 24 h after
injection. The pharmacokinetic profile did not substantially change
at doses ranging between 2 and 62 Ag (Fig. 3A). Similarly, IL-15-L19
showed high tumor uptake values after 24 h (4.1% ID/g) but
somewhat higher values in normal organs, ranging between 0.7%
and 2.8% ID/g (Fig. 3A). Tumor to blood ratios were comparable
with 5.3:1 for L19-IL-15 and 4:1 for IL-15-L19. For the sake of
comparison, the fusion protein L19-IL-2 in the same tumor model
exhibited 4% ID/g in the tumor at 24 h, with a tumor to blood ratio
of 28 (17).
L19-GM-CSF exhibited only modest tumor to organ ratios at
24 h (Fig. 3B) when administered at low dose (1 Ag). However, the
tumor-targeting performance increased when the immunocytokine
dose was increased (at a 2 Ag dose, tumor to organ ratios ranging

between 2 and 12) or when the radioiodinated protein was
coadministered with a 20- or 30-fold molar excess on unlabeled
fusion protein to saturate GM-CSF receptors on leukocytes.
Therapy experiments with s.c. F9 and C51 murine tumors
in immunocompetent mice. 129SvEv mice bearing F9 tumors, or
BALB/c mice bearing C51 colon adenocarcinomas, were chosen
as s.c. murine models of cancer for the assessment of the
therapeutic action of L19-IL-15, IL-15-L19, and L19-GM-CSF.
Because L19-GM-CSF had exhibited a dose-dependent tumortargeting performance, this fusion protein was tested at different
doses (15, 30, and 60 Ag per injection) in therapy experiments in
the F9 s.c. tumor model. Only a dose of 60 Ag per injection (daily
injections over 4 days) led to significant tumor growth inhibition
(data not shown). In the following therapy experiments, the
fusion proteins were administered at a dose of 75 Ag (thrice every
second day) corresponding to an i.v. injected volume of 300 AL. At
this dose, no side effects could be detected for both fusion

proteins. The immunocytokines started to form higher-order
noncovalent oligomers at concentrations >0.25 mg/mL, thus
preventing escalation above the 75 Ag dose.
Figure 4 shows that both L19-IL-15 and L19-GM-CSF substantially inhibited tumor growth compared with control mice treated
with saline [P = 0.008 at day 15 for L19-IL-15; P = 0.005 for L19GM-CSF at day 14 for F9 tumors (Fig. 4A and B); P = 0.001 at day 14
for L19-IL-15; P = 0.026 for L19-GM-CSF at day 14 for C51 tumors
(Fig. 4C and D)]. IL-15-L19 could also substantially inhibited tumor
growth compared with control mice treated with saline (P = 0.038
at day 17; data not shown). However, L19-IL-15 showed a stronger
therapeutic benefit.
By contrast, HyHEL10-IL-15 and HyHEL10-GM-CSF did not
significantly inhibit tumor growth compared with saline (P = 0.1
and 0.07 at days 15 and 14, respectively; Fig. 4A and B), showing the
contribution of the L19-mediated cytokine targeting to the
therapeutic effect.

radioiodinated protein mixed with 60 Ag unlabeled L19-GM-CSF). Targeting results are expressed as %ID/g at 24 h (n z 3).

Therapy experiments in metastatic models of F9 and C51
tumors. When injected i.v., F9 tumor cells may give rise to liver
metastases (29, 40), whereas C51 cells preferentially yield lung
metastases (27). We used these animal models to assess the
antimetastatic potential of L19-IL-15 and L19-GM-CSF. The
immunocytokines were administered i.v. thrice (days 3, 5, and
7 following tumor cell injection). Twenty-one days after tumor
cell inoculation, mice were sacrificed and metastatic load was
assessed by counting foci in relevant organs (Fig. 5). Both
immunocytokines displayed a clear antimetastatic activity compared with control mice treated with saline (L19-IL-15: P = 0.0008
for F9 tumors and P = 0.001 for C51 tumors; L19-GM-CSF: P = 0.014

for F9 tumors and P = 0.0008 for C51 tumors). L19-IL-15 was
strikingly active against F9 tumors (three of five free of metastases),
whereas L19-GM-CSF did better in the C51 lung metastasis setting.
In vivo T-cell depletion and response to therapy. To elucidate
the T-cell contribution to the antitumoral activity of L19-IL-15 and
L19-GM-CSF, we did therapy studies in mice bearing s.c. F9 tumors,
depleting CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes. Depleting antibodies were
administered 6 days before tumor implantation to ensure >95% cell
depletion at the time of tumor cell inoculation. Mice received a
therapeutic dose of immunocytokines at days 5, 7, and 9 after tumor
cell implantation. Figure 5 clearly shows how CD4+ T-cell depletion
has no significant effect on the immunocytokine-mediated

completely abrogates the therapeutic effect (P = 0.03 for L19-IL-15
and P = 0.018 for L19-GM-CSF). These data indicate a crucial
contribution of CD8+ T lymphocytes as mediators for the

Discussion
In this article, we have described the cloning, expression, and
anticancer properties of two novel immunocytokines (L19-IL-15
and L19-GM-CSF), which recognize the EDB domain of fibronectin,
a marker of angiogenesis. Both immunocytokines were shown to
preferentially localize in tumors following i.v. injection and to
potently inhibit the growth of s.c. and metastatic F9 and C51
tumors in immunocompetent murine models.
The L19 antibody is uniquely suited for the systematic
investigation of the therapeutic potential of antibody-based
anticancer pharmaceuticals because it recognizes a tumorassociated antigen, which is virtually absent in all normal tissues
and is strongly expressed in the majority of aggressive solid tumors,
with a prominent perivascular pattern of staining (12, 17, 22,
30–32). Furthermore, EDB is identical in sequence among different
species (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey, and man), which allows
the use of immunocompetent animal models with the same
antibody, which will be used for clinical studies. Finally, the L19
antibody has been extensively characterized in biodistribution and
imaging studies both in animal models of pathology and in patients

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

with cancer. Two phase II clinical trials are currently in progress
with L19-IL-2 and the L19 antibody in SIP format, labeled with
iodine-131, whereas L19-TNF has completed monkey toxicology
studies and is about to enter clinical testing. In this respect, the
comparative analysis of the therapeutic potential of different L19
derivatives allows a clinically relevant evaluation of various
antibody functionalization strategies. More than 30 derivatives of
the L19 antibody have been characterized until now by biodistribution studies and by in vivo therapy experiments.
The partially overlapping immunologic activities of IL-15 and
IL-2, together with the consideration that L19-IL-2 is in advanced
clinical studies, raise questions about relative advantages and
disadvantages for L19-IL-2 and L19-IL-15. In mouse models of
cancer, both biopharmaceuticals display comparable tumortargeting efficacy. The clinical translation of L19-IL-2 has been
greatly facilitated by the fact that IL-2 is an approved biopharmaceutical. On the other hand, both IL-15 and L19-IL-15 display an
excellent safety profile. In murine models of cancer and vascular
leak syndrome, IL-15 is approximately six times less toxic than IL-2,
although the therapeutic index for IL-15 is 3-fold higher than the
one calculated for IL-2 (46). In our study, no weight loss could be
detected for 225 Ag cumulative dose of L19-IL-15. The use of higher
doses in mice will require improved formulations to prevent
antibody oligomerization. In humans, the possibility to administer
larger infusion volumes facilitates clinical development.
The gain of biological activity of IL-15-L19 following deglycosylation is consistent with previous reports on a mutant of huIL-15
that is not active on CTLL-2 cells (47). This protein contains the

Figure 6. T-cell depletion of 129SvEv
mice bearing s.c. F9 tumor and response
to L19-IL-15 and L19-GM-CSF therapy.
129SvEv mice were depleted from CD4+
or CD8+ T cells before F9 tumor cell
implantation. When tumors were clearly
palpable, mice were grouped (n = 5) and
therapy was started as described in
Materials and Methods. Arrows, mice were

L19-GM-CSF (B ) at different time points.

mutations Asp8Ser and Gln108Ser and can still bind to the cytokine
receptor but shows no biological activity at all. IL-15-L19, in
contrast to L19-IL-15, is fully glycosylated (Fig. 2B) and one of the
glycosylated asparagines (Asn112) is structurally close to the
essential Gln108, and this additional modification completely
abolishes the in vitro activity of IL-15-L19.
In addition to L19-IL-15, this article reports for the first time a
fusion protein between a tumor-targeting scFv fragment and GMCSF. In a previous study, the groups of Penichet and Morrison had
described the tumor inhibition properties of a recombinant fusion
between an IgG specific to HER-2/neu and muGM-CSF (37). We
normally prefer to engineer immunocytokines based on antibody
fragments (e.g., scFv fragments) because the use of full immunoglobulin leads to the construction of multifunctional therapeutic
proteins, which may engage Fc receptors and activate complement,
in addition to antigen binding and cytokine receptor activation.
Furthermore, recombinant immunocytokines devoid of Fc portion
typically lead to lower uptake values in liver and spleen as well as
to better tumor to organ ratios at earlier time points.
Biodistribution studies done at different antibody doses of L19GM-CSF clearly revealed an improved tumor-targeting performance at higher doses (Fig. 3C). These findings are in line with
previous observations made by our group for the study of other
immunocytokines. For example, the fusion protein L19-IFN-g
displays a superior tumor-targeting performance in tumor-bearing
mice, which are knocked out for the IFN-g receptor, compared with

www.aacrjournals.org

immunocompetent mice. These data suggest a possible competition between the antibody-mediated tumor targeting and the
capture of immunocytokines by cells, which express the cytokine
receptor and soluble receptor, respectively. In the mouse, this
competition is clearly detectable for cytokines, which feature
abundant and high-affinity receptors (e.g., IFN-g and GM-CSF), but
is not obviously detectable for potent immunostimulatory
cytokines, which are used at ultralow doses (e.g., IL-12, IL-2, and
TNF; refs. 17, 23, 28).
Tumor therapy experiments with depletion of CD4+ and CD8+
T cells (Fig. 6) clearly revealed a functional role for CD8+
T lymphocytes in the anticancer activity of both L19-IL-15 and
L19-GM-CSF. This observation is different compared with the
situation encountered with L19-IL-2, where the activation and
tumor infiltration of NK cells was shown to be a main determinant
of the immunocytokine therapeutic activity. Indeed, the therapy of
F9 tumors in immunocompetent mice or nude mice gave
comparable results in the case of L19-IL-2 (17).
The promising anticancer activities observed for L19-IL-15 and
L19-GM-CSF, together with their easy expression and excellent
stability, strongly motivate clinical development programs based
on these two biopharmaceuticals. The excellent tumor-targeting
ability of the L19 antibody and the conservation of EDB between
mouse and man suggest that the therapeutic activities observed
in immunocompetent murine models may be at least in part be
translated to patients in the oncology setting. However, it is worth

remembering that tumor therapy studies done in mice with
human antibody-based pharmaceuticals can only be done in the
acute administration setting (i.e., three or four injections in up to
8 days) due to potential immunogenicity of the human protein in
rodents. Only clinical studies can reveal the true pharmaceutical
potential of L19-IL-15 and of L19-GM-CSF for the therapy of
cancer.
