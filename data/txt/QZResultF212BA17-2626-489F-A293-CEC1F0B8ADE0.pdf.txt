ABSTRACT
Doxorubicin (Dox) is a cytotoxic drug widely incorporated in various chemotherapy
protocols. Severe side effects such as cardiotoxicity, however, limit Dox application.
Mechanisms by which Dox promotes cardiac damage and cardiomyocyte cell death
have been investigated extensively, but a definitive picture has yet to emerge.
Autophagy, regarded generally as a protective mechanism that maintains cell viability
by recycling unwanted and damaged cellular constituents, is nevertheless subject to
dysregulation having detrimental effects for the cell. Autophagic cell death has been
described, and has been proposed to contribute to Dox-cardiotoxicity. Additionally,
mitophagy, autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria, is affected by Dox in a
manner contributing to toxicity. Here we will review Dox-induced cardiotoxicity and
cell death in the broad context of the autophagy and mitophagy processes.

OVERVIEW
OF
CARDIOTOXICITY

DOX-INDUCED

nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) such as superoxide,
hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite
has been proposed to be the main cause of Dox-induced
acute cardiomyocyte toxicity and cell death by damaging
various molecular constituents and organelles [9-12]. A
detailed description of the pathways by which Dox induces
production of ROS and RNS can be found in references
[13, 14]. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase (NOX) enzymes
play an important role in Dox-induced production of
ROS [15]. Dox can be reduced to a semiquinone by NOX
and/or NOS leading to the production of superoxide
and hydrogen peroxide, and subsequently the highly
reactive hydroxyl radical [14]. NOS enzymes catalyze the
production of nitric oxide from N-arginine; superoxide
can react with nitric oxide producing peroxynitrite
which is highly reactive oxidizing DNA, proteins, and
peroxidizing lipids. Both endothelial NOS (eNOS) and
inducible NOS (iNOS) isoforms have been implicated in
mediating Dox toxicity via the production of RNS [16].
Deletion or overproduction of eNOS in mice was shown,
respectively, to improve or worsen cardiac outcome postDox compared to wild type groups [17]. There is also
some evidence that iNOS, which is increased by Dox

Doxorubicin (Dox), a non-selective class I
anthracycline antibiotic, is a potent chemotherapeutic
agent which is used for the treatment of numerous cancers
[1]. The use of Dox is limited, however, due to serious
side effects; the most prominent is cardiotoxicity which
can manifest acutely as well as years after treatment has
been discontinued leading to left ventricular dysfunction,
dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure [2-4]. Toxic
effects of Dox include cardiomyocyte damage and
apoptotic and necrotic cell death [5]. The severity of heart
disease is linked to accumulated Dox dosage during the
course of the anticancer therapy ranging from 3-5% in
patients that received a cumulative dose of 400mg/m2 to
18-48% in patients receiving 700mg/m2 (and 100% of
mice receiving 71mg/ m2) [1, 6, 7].
Dox is a mitochondrial toxin, and mitochondrial
damage is central to Dox-induced cardiac dysfunction
and cell death [8]. Cardiomyocytes require large numbers
of healthy-functioning mitochondria to ensure sufficient
ATP production for contractile function and cell survival.
Dox-induced over-production of reactive oxygen and

iNOS-knockout mice showed protection from Doxinduced toxicity [18]. Dox also interacts with iron, and
Dox-iron complexes contribute to further hydroxyl radical
production. Hydroxyl radical damages DNA and proteins
and extensively peroxidizes lipids which contribute to
major cellular damage and death [19].
Dox has a robust attraction to negatively charged
membranes such as the inner mitochondrial membrane
causing lipid peroxidation [10, 20]. Dox-induced
peroxidation of cardiolipin uncouples respiratory chain
complexes at mitochondria, resulting in reduced ATP
and increased ROS production [21-24], and promoting
formation of the of mitochondrial permeability transition
pore, mPTP. Formation of mPTP causes cytochrome C
release and induction of an intrinsic pathway of apoptosis;
it is also an important feature of necrotic cell death [25].
Despite multiple studies and strong evidence from many
experimental models that anti-oxidant therapies can
decrease or prevent Dox-induced cardiotoxicity, results
have not been as promising in the clinical setting [2628]. Additional mechanisms of Dox-toxicity need to be
considered and targeted.
Dox kills rapidly proliferating cancer cells by
intercalating with their DNA and forming covalent
adducts which lead to the inhibition of DNA polymerase
and nucleic acid synthesis. Additionally, Dox cross-links
Topoisomerase IIα (TOPIIα) to the DNA, forming a
TOPIIα-Dox-DNA complex resulting in DNA breakage
and cell death, a major mechanism for killing cancer cells
which express high levels of TOPIIα [29-33]. Unlike
tumor cells, cardiomyocytes do not express TOPIIα,
rather they express topoisomerase IIβ (TOPIIβ) which can
also form DNA-TOPIIβ-Dox complexes, cause doublestrand breaks and cell death [34, 35]. Dox-induced DNA
damage, mediated by TOPIIβ significantly alters the
nuclear and mitochondrial transcriptome and markedly
decreases mitochondrial biogenesis [36, 37]. There is
strong evidence that TOPIIβ is a major contributor to Doxinduced cardiotoxicity; transgenic mice lacking TOPIIβ
were not susceptible to Dox cardiotoxicity in an acute as
well as chronic setting [37]. Interestingly, the compound
dexrazoxane which is in clinical use for preventing Doxinduced cardiomyopathy due to its iron-chelating and antioxidant properties[38], belongs to the molecular category
of TOPII poisons. It has been suggested that the TOPIIβ
inhibitory activity, rather than the iron-chelating action, of
dexrazoxane confers protection of cardiomyocytes from
Dox [39].
Dox induced DNA damage leads to the activation of
the Ataxia-Telengiectasia Mutated protein which binds to
DNA break sites and upregulates and activates the tumor
suppressor protein p53 [40]. Upregulation of p53 by Dox
has been linked to increased ROS and double strand DNA
damage, and there is considerable support to the notion
that p53 protein is mediating Dox-induced apoptotic cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

death of cardiomyocytes in vitro and in vivo [41-43].
Anthracycline-induced p53 up-regulation is reported
to suppress transcription of GATA-4, a cardioprotective
transcription factor [44]. Nevertheless, p53-independent
pathways to Dox-induced deleterious effects in
cardiomyocytes, such as apoptotic cell death, oxidative
and nitrosative stress, and cardiac fibrosis have also been
documented, in a mouse model of cardiomyocyte-specific
p53 knockout [45]. In addition, using a juvenile model
of Dox toxicity, Zhu and colleagues reported antithetical
roles for p53 in the acute versus chronic response to Dox:
the expression of dominant-interfering p53 in the heart
resulted in short-term (1 week) protection against Dox, but
worse outcome, compared to wild type mice at 13 weeks
post -Dox [46]. Overall, it would appear that the role of
p53 in mediating the multiple Dox-induced deleterious
effects is context dependent, and likely depends on the
model used and the timing of the assessment.
An important effector of Dox-induced cell death is
Bnip3 (BH3-only protein Bcl-2-like 19 kDa-interacting
protein-3), a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. There
is evidence that Dox-induced cardiotoxicity is mediated
by upregulation of Bnip3 and induction of necrosis in
cardiomyocytes [47]. A similar protein, Bnip3L/NIX, an
effector of apoptosis, was also found to be upregulated
in the heart and myocytes by Dox, in vivo and in vitro,
in response to Dox-induced downregulation of miR-30
[48]. To show the crucial role of Bnip3, transgenic mice
were created expressing a mutant form of Bnip3 which is
unable to insert to mitochondrial membranes; these mice
were resistant to Dox induced cardiotoxicity [47]. Bnip3
causes depolarization of mitochondria by promoting
mPTP formation which leads to cell death [47]. Both
p53 and Bnip3 are also considered to regulate autophagy
[47], as will be discussed in the following section. Dox
treatment promotes premature ageing of cardiomyocytes,
in vitro (long-term cultures) and in vivo [49, 50]. It is of
interest that ageing is characterized by decreased potential
for autophagy and mitophagy, and this in turn contributes
to the pathology of ageing [51]. One might therefore
surmise that Dox-induced chronic changes would, as in
ageing, also include reduced ability for autophagy. This
was shown to be the case by Hoshino and colleagues
[52], who reported decreased autophagic elimination of
damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) in models of ageing as
well as during Dox-induced cardiotoxicity in vitro and in
vivo. Figure 1 shows a broad overview of the mechanisms
implicated in Dox-cardiotoxicity

AUTOPHAGY
Autophagy is a conserved process aimed at
maintaining cell and tissue homeostasis under normal as
well as stress conditions, including nutrient starvation,
changes in metabolism, and energy and oxygen status.
Autophagy can be subdivided to micro-autophagy,

chaperone mediated autophagy, and macro-autophagy;
the latter refers to the sequestration of cytosolic cargo by
double-membrane bound vesicles, with subsequent fusion
with lysosomes for degradation [53]. The term autophagy

as used here refers to macro-autophagy. The overall Doxinduced cellular changes such as the accumulation of
oxidized and damaged macromolecules and organelles as
well as significantly reduced mitochondrial capacity for

Figure 1: Subcellular events associated with Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. The image highlights acute, intermediate,
and end-point (cell death) events resulting from exposure to Doxorubicin (Dox). The acute section illustrates the direct interaction of
Dox with subcellular entities; the intermediate section illustrates direct consequences of these interactions. Events within the acute, or
intermediate sections are likely to occur simultaneously and cross-talk with each other. The end-point section is meant to show that the
preceding events lead to apoptotic, necrotic, and/or dysregulated autophagy-associated cell death. Acute Events: Dox, upon entering the
cell, interacts directly with molecules and organelles: interaction with topoisomerase-IIβ (TOPIIβ) leads to DNA damage. Interaction with
nitric oxide synthase (NOS), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase (NOX) and Fe2+, promotes reactive oxygen or nitrogen
species stress (ROS or RNS, respectively), contributing to further DNA damage, oxidation and nitrosylation of proteins and peroxidation
of lipids. Dox binds to mitochondrial DNA and impairs the electron transport chain resulting in production of ROS and decreased ATP.
Fe2+-Dox complexes are toxic to mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), by causing, for example, lipid (including cardiolipin)
peroxidation. The DNA damage response activates the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein which upregulates and activates the
tumor suppressor p53. P53 upregulates expression of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family such as Bax and Bad; it also increases
expression of Bcl2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (Bnip3), which can cause mitochondrial damage and necrotic
cell death, as well as initiate mitophagy. DNA damage and increased levels of ROS lead to downregulation of the transcription factor
GATA-4 which decreases expression of the anti-apoptotic, and anti-autophagy-initiation protein, Bcl-2. P53 can also inhibit the activity of
mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, thus dis-inhibiting autophagy initiation. Some studies have indicated that Dox can
elicit AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) activation. Activation of AMPK, resulting from reduced ATP levels, can inactivate mTOR and initiate
autophagy. Dox-induced effects on ROS and RNS production, mitochondrial and ER damage, DNA and gene expression, culminate in the
promotion of apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Dysregulation of the autophagy/mitophagy processes are also linked to Dox-induced cell
death. Signals/events associated mostly, although not exclusively, with apoptotic or necrotic cell death are included, respectively, in pink or
pale-blue boxes. Pale-purple boxes contain signals/pathways associated with various types of subcellular dysfunction, including autophagic
dysregulation.

ATP production would be expected to trigger autophagy.
The autophagy process is composed of several steps.
Initiation of autophagy describes the formation of the
isolation membrane and phagophore, which then expands
to engulf the cargo (protein aggregates or damaged
organelles), thus forming the autophagosome. The process
is completed by autophagosome clearance which occurs
after fusion with lysosomes enabling degradation of
cargo by lysosomal enzymes as illustrated in Figure 2.
Degradation by-products, such as amino acids, can then
be re-used for the building of new macromolecules or for
meeting metabolic demands [54].
Several autophagy related genes (Atg) and signal
transduction pathways have been implicated in autophagy
initiation and progression, and have been described in
some detail in recent reviews [55]. Autophagic initiation
requires the phosphorylation of the protein Beclin-1 by
ULK-1 (activated unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase
1), with subsequent activation of VPS34 (vesicle-mediated
vacuolar protein sorting 34) complexes. VPS34 is a class
II PI3 kinase, increasing phosphatidyl inositol phosphate
(PI3P), involved in the recruitment of other Atg proteins,
phagophore formation and elongation [56-58]. The LC3
(light chain 3 microtubule associated protein) is converted
to LC-3I after proteolytic cleavage of its C-terminus; LC3-I
is then lipidated, becoming LC3-II, which associates with
the double membrane of the autophagosome. LC3-II acts
as a ‘hook’ for proteins possessing an LC3-II-interacting
domain (LIR), recruiting them to the autophagosome. One
of these proteins is the scaffold protein p62/ SQSTM1,
which possesses both a LIR domain and ubiquitinbinding domain [59]. p62/SQSTM1 attracts ubiquitinated
aggregates to the autophagosome, and therefore facilitates
their eventual degradation. Completion of the autophagy
process, autophagosome clearance following fusion with
the lysosome, results in the degradation of p62/ SQSTM1
by lysosomal enzymes. Increased accumulation of p62/
SQSTM1, on the other hand, is linked to the inhibition
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of autophagic flux/clearance [59]. Other proteins can act
in a manner similar to p62/ SQSTM1. These include the
“neighbor of BRCA1 gene 1” (NBR1) [60]; the TNFreceptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) [61], and the Smad
ubiquitin regulatory factor 1, SMURF1 [62].
Lysosomal associated membrane proteins
(LAMPs) are essential for recognition and fusion
with autophagosomes; mutations in LAMP2 (Danon’s
disease) are associated with incomplete autophagy and
accumulation of autophagosomes, resulting in systemic
problems, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in
patients [63].
The most upstream signaling component of the
autophagy process is represented by the ULK-1 kinase
complex [64]. This complex is under tight control of
two major signaling pathways, mammalian target of
Rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP activated protein kinase
(AMPK). While mTOR inhibits, AMPK activates ULK-1
[58]. Both of these pathways are affected by Dox, although
there are some conflicting data, especially regarding the
role of AMPK activation.
AMPK is a central sensor of cell energetic status
[65]. Low cellular energy levels, increased ROS, and
elevated intracellular Ca2+ lead to the phosphorylation and
activation of AMPK [66]. Additionally, some cytokines
(such as adiponectin) [67, 68] and growth factors (such
as vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF) have been
shown to activate AMPK, by activating an upstream
phosphorylating enzyme, LKB-1 (Liver Kinase B-1) [68,
69]. Activated AMPK is capable of inducing autophagy by
de-repressing mTOR-mediated autophagy inhibition [70].
The serine/threonine kinase mTOR, activated
downstream of growth factors and receptor tyrosine
kinase signaling, is a highly conserved kinase considered
to act as a master regulator of cell growth, metabolism,
and protein synthesis, and to inhibit autophagy initiation.
The mTOR forms two different signaling complexes
(mTORC1 and mTORC2) [71]. The mTORC1 is a point
46667

of convergence for autophagy regulatory signals: it binds
to the ULK-1 complex (phosphorylating ULK-1 at serine
757) and prevents the ULK-1-mediated phosphorylation of
Beclin-1. As mentioned earlier, Beclin-1 phosphorylation

is required for autophagy initiation; thus mTORC1
negatively regulates autophagy initiation [57, 58].
Activated AMPK can phosphorylate ULK-1 complex at
Ser317 and Ser 777. These phosphorylations are required

Figure 2: The autophagy process. The figure illustrates major steps constituting the process of autophagy, aiming at recycling targeted

cargo. Vertical blue arrows point to a progression from autophagy-initiation via the activated unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase 1
(ULK-1) complex, to the formation/elongation of membranous entities such as the phagophore; to the formation of the autophagosome
around the cargo, followed by fusion with the lysosomes and formation of autolysosomes where cargo is degraded. Major signaling
pathways regulating the initiation of autophagy are included in the upper portion, separated from the rest of the figure by the broken line,
and include the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and AMP activated kinase (AMPK) pathways. Activators of mTOR, include
growth factors and high nutrient status, while activation of AMPK occurs when AMP/ATP ratio increases, and also upon increased calcium
activating calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK). The figure shows the antithetical action of mTOR versus
AMPK on autophagy initiation, as manifested by ULK-1 activation. ULK-1 mediated activation of Beclin-1 and vesicle-mediated vacuolar
protein sorting 34 (VPS34) complex initiates a cascade of events leading to phagophore formation. A few representative proteins associated
with the autophagy process are included for each step. Autophagy related gene (Atg) proteins 5, 12, and 16 incorporation elongates the
formed phagophore. LC3-II is formed by proteolytic cleavage and lipidation of microtubule-associated proteins light chain 3B (LC3-II)
which anchors it to the phagophore. Ubiquitination tags damaged cargo which can then interact with the ubiquitin binding protein, p62/
SQSTM1, and, via interaction of the latter with LC3-II, cargo is engulfed within the autophagosome. For completion of the process, fusion
of autophagosomes with lysosomes is required, to form autolysosomes. In the autolysosomes cargo and associated proteins are digested by
the various degradative lysosomal enzymes, symbolized by scissor images.

It is anticipated that modest activation of autophagy
would eliminate dysfunctional mitochondria which are
responsible for increased ROS production, remove any
toxic aggregates and generally boost cellular health before
Dox insult.

DOX AND THE AUTOPHAGY PROCESS
Stimulation of autophagy prior to Dox is
protective

Dox-induced effects on the autophagy process are
deleterious

A number of studies have indicated that boosting
autophagy prior to the administration of Dox can protect
from Dox toxicity. Administration of Rapamycin, an
mTOR inhibitor which is used to stimulate autophagy,
rescued mice from Dox-induced cardiomyopathy [72].
In aging rats, moderate caloric restriction in combination
with resveratrol administration prior to Dox (6 weeks)
stimulated autophagy, and protected against subsequent
Dox toxicity [73]. Moderate diet restriction in rats, a

While the boosting of autophagy before Dox appears
to be cardioprotective, post-Dox autophagy-associated
signaling likely contributes to Dox-induced toxicity
and presents a complex, not fully understood picture.
Nevertheless, strategies aimed at preventing post-Dox
autophagy-initiation and autophagosome formation have

Figure 3: Mitophagy receptors. Four pathways leading to targeting/ recognition of mitochondria for autophagic elimination have been

described. The Parkin/PINK1 pathway, operating on depolarized mitochondria, consists of PINK1 stabilization, enabling interaction with
Parkin and its translocation to the outer mitochondrial membrane, OMM. Parkin can ubiquitinate various OMM proteins enabling recognition
and interaction with p62/SQSTM1. LC3-II can interact with p62/SQSTM1 allowing autophagosomal engulfment of mitochondria, and
subsequent degradation via fusion with the lysosome. In the second pathway, Bcl2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3
(Bnip3) can also act as mitophagy receptor, as it possesses the LC3-II recognition motif, as well as a transmembrane domain which anchors
it to mitochondria. Nix/Bnip3L (the other member of Bnip3 family) acts in a similar fashion. Translocation of Bnip3 to mitochondria does
not require loss of membrane potential. Additional molecules possessing LC3-II-interacting ability include FUN14 Domain Containing 1
(FUNDC1), and peroxidized cardiolipin.

been shown to be protective. Pharmacologic inhibition
of post-Dox autophagy by 3-methyladenine (a class III
PI3-kinase inhibitor) or the silencing of Beclin-1 or Atg-5
protected cardiac cells from Dox toxicity [11, 76-80].
There is emerging consensus that Dox induces
cellular changes consistent with autophagy initiation and
autophagosome formation in cardiac cells, shown by a
variety of approaches. Transmission electron microscopy
evaluation in H9C2 cells indicated that Dox increases
prevalence of autophagic vacuoles [11]. Dox-induced
accumulation of autophagic vacuoles has been shown in
mouse [75] and rat hearts [81]. Increased LC3-II levels
and upregulation of autophagy related genes have been
reported [11, 68, 76-80, 82-85]. Immunofluorescencebased detection of ‘dots’ (autophagosomes) containing
either endogenous LC3-II, or overexpressed GFP-LC3
also pointed to the upregulation of autophagosome
formation or accumulation, in in vitro and in vivo studies
[11, 68, 77, 79, 82, 85]. In some models, however,
decreased relative levels of lipidated LC3-II in response
to Dox were reported [86-88]. Dox induced up-regulation
of Beclin-1 and Atg-5 has been corroborated by several
studies [68, 77, 80]. Atg-5 upregulation in mouse hearts

and primary cardiomyocytes furthermore is attributed to
the overproduction of 4-Hydroxynonenal, 4-HNE through
lipid peroxidation, [76].
The effect of Dox on specific signals associated
with various steps of the autophagy process has been
addressed in several studies. AMPK and mTOR signals
are considered to play antithetical roles, with AMPK
triggering and mTOR inhibiting autophagy initiation
[66, 71]. Conflicting reports exist on the effect of Dox on
AMPK activation, summarized in Table 1. Several groups,
using in vitro and in vivo systems, have reported AMPK
activation post-Dox [11, 58, 89, 90]. Decreased cardiac
AMPK activity post-Dox has also been described [75, 9195], while no changes in AMPK activation post-Dox have
also been reported [96, 97]. It is possible that the effect of
Dox on AMPK is transient or cyclical, and dependent on a
multiplicity of parameters including dosage and duration
of treatment with Dox and experimental models used. The
effects of age, sex and even circadian rhythm may also
need to be considered [98].
There is strong evidence based on in vitro and in
vivo studies in rat, mouse and rabbit models that Dox
inhibits mTOR, an inhibition that is expected to contribute

Figure 4: Proposed mechanisms of Dox-induced dysregulation of autophagy and mitophagy resulting in cell death.

Dox stimulates autophagy initiation (by upregulating Atg genes, for example) and at the same time, by decreasing expression of the
master transcription factor EB (TFEB), impairs function of available lysosomes and prevents their biogenesis resulting in autophagosome
accumulation and inhibition of flux. Autophagosome accumulation contributes to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dox
induced changes in gene expression include the downregulation of Parkin and via p53, in impairment of its translocation to mitochondria,
thus inhibiting Parkin/PINK1 mediated mitophagy. Parkin-independent mitophagy, such as Bcl-2-like 19 KDa-interacting protein-3 (Bnip3)
- mediated mitophagy can be upregulated. Overall, the dysregulated autophagy and impaired mitophagy can induce cardiomyocyte death.

to cardiomyocyte injury [11, 90, 99-102], possibly by
causing an exacerbated autophagy-initiation response,
summarized in Table 2. Dox-induced mTOR inhibition
has been linked to p53 upregulation. Mice expressing
cardiomyocyte-restricted dominant-interfering p53 are
resistant to Dox induced cardiotoxicity, and retain normal
levels of active mTOR, at least in the acute setting.
Additionally, mice expressing cardiomyocyte-restricted
constitutively active mTOR were found to be resistant
to Dox insult [101]. Another group reported that p53
upregulation led to increased Bnip3 in cardiomyocytes
[43]; knock-down of Bnip3 or dominant-negative
inhibition of Bnip3 abrogated p53-induced autophagy.
Another pathway by which Dox can promote
autophagy initiation may be through the p53-mediated
suppression of the transcription factor GATA-4 and the
resulting down-regulation of the pro-survival protein
Bcl-2. Bcl-2 binds to Beclin-1 and thus prevents it from
interacting with VPS34, and from initiating autophagy [56,
79]. Dox can also promote Bcl-2 phosphorylation which
inhibits the Bcl-2/Beclin1 interaction again facilitating
autophagy initiation [42].
Overall Dox affects a number of signaling
pathways converging to a robust initiation of autophagy
and stimulation of autophagosome formation. For
the autophagy process to elicit a protective effect,
however, it is important that the process is completed
through autophagosome clearance. In this context,
cargo recognition/tagging (by ubiquitin) and lysosomal
degradation are important steps. Thus it is important
to examine how Dox affects ubiquitination, the p62/
SQSTM1protein, and the lysosomes.
It has been widely confirmed that Dox significantly
increases the total levels of ubiquitinated proteins in
cardiomyocytes [72, 75, 78, 82, 85, 86]. The ubiquitinated
cargo can interact with p62/ SQSTM1 and facilitate
lysosomal targeting. Whether Dox-induced hyperubiquitination is due to massive damage to intracellular
proteins, dysregulation in signaling pathways of
the ubiquitination process, or because of decreased
proteasomal degradation is still to be elucidated [103].
It is interesting to note that Dox affects various types
of ubiquitin ligases in heart cells. DOX upregulates the
muscle specific ubiquitine ligase MuRF 1 (Muscle RING
finger 1), and also muscle atrophy F-box (MAFbx)/
atrogin-1 which contributes to its cardiotoxic properties
[104], while decreasing the expression of Parkin, another
E3 ubiquitin ligase which is important for mitophagy [84].
Several groups have examined the effect of Dox
on the accumulation of p62/ SQSTM1, with conflicting
results. Increased p62/ SQSTM1 levels in the hearts of rat
and mouse models post-Dox (1-6 days) have been reported
[73, 75, 105]; a decrease in p62/ SQSTM1 has been
observed post-Dox [77, 84]. A biphasic response has also
been described, consisting of increases in p62/ SQSTM1
at earlier time points post-Dox, followed by decreased
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or baseline levels at later time points [85, 106].These
differences may reflect differences in Dox dosage, sex,
different strains of animals, different cell types for in vitro
studies, and most importantly, different treatment duration
and end-points. This issue needs to be investigated further,
because measuring p62/ SQSTM1 levels post-Dox is used
to document effects on autophagy clearance/flux and
completion of autophagy.
There is an emerging consensus, strengthened
by recent studies, that Dox inhibits autophagic flux,
by inhibiting lysosomal biogenesis and/or lysosomal
function [72, 75, 88, 105, 106]. Bartlett and colleagues
demonstrated that Dox decreases expression of TFEB
(transcription factor EB) which regulates the expression
of genes related to autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis
[88]. Decreased TFEB expression in cardiomyocytes led
to proteotoxicity and cell death; restoration of TFEB on
the other hand restored flux and prevented cell death[88].
Using an experimental model of moderate Dox-induced
toxicity, Li and colleagues showed that Dox-induced
early upregulation of LC3-II was caused by inhibition
of autophagic flux; furthermore, Dox was shown to
promote autolysosome accumulation and prevention
of lysosomal acidification in vivo [106]. Using tandem
green fluorescence (GFP)-red fluorescence (RFP)-LC3
constructs in rat neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes, the
same groups showed that Dox inhibited autophagic flux
in vitro. It is of note that while both reports implicated
the lysosomes in causing inhibition of autophagic flux,
one group did not see any changes in lysosome number
per se [106], while the other reported decreased lysosome
accumulation due to Dox [88]. This difference likely
reflects methodological issues with the use of LysoTracker dye which detects acidic organelles; the increase
in lysosomal pH caused by Dox [106] may have led to
an underestimation of lysosomes, and autolysosomes,
by Lyso-Tracker Red [88, 106]. Regardless of the
precise mechanism, impaired autophagic flux caused by
Dox, would be expected to promote increased ROS and
proteotoxicity.
By attenuating autophagy-initiation through the use
of Beclin-1 haplo- insufficient mice Li and colleagues
[106] were able to prevent Dox-induced toxicity,
illustrating the detrimental role of autophagy initiation
post-Dox. An important observation from the work by
Li and colleagues was that Dox-induced inhibition of
autophagic flux was observed only within a certain time
period post-Dox, and not at later time points such as 4
weeks post-Dox [106]. Thus discrepancies between
studies regarding the effects of Dox on autophagy may
be cause by “lack of evaluation of autophagy as a process
of flux”, using instead “snapshot-in time” approaches
[106]. Tandem GFP-RFP-LC3 (“green” and “red”)
fluorescence reporter approaches are increasingly used
to monitor the movement of LC3-II from autophagosome
to autolysosome, based on differences in fluorescence

caused by differences in pH. The neutral environment
of the autophagosome would allow both GFP and
RFP fluorescence, while the acidic environment of
autolysosome would only allow RFP, “red”, fluorescence.
Because, however, Dox was shown to inhibit lysosomal
functionality by preventing acidification, reliance
on the tandem GFP-RFP-LC3 approach may lead to
underestimation of lysosomal, and autolysosomal presence
post-Dox [88, 106]. Thus complementary approaches are
required to monitor the various steps of the autophagy
process after Dox administration.
The use of inhibitors such as Bafilomycin A1
(prevents fusion of autophagosome to the lysosome) and
Chloroquine (inhibits lysosomal activity), introduces
additional interpretation issues. By blocking lysosomal
degradation of cargo these reagents can indicate whether
changes in the levels of ‘classic’ autophagy markers (LC3II and p62/ SQSTM1 for example) are due to an effect on
de novo autophagosome formation or on autophagosome
cargo degradation [59]. However, the timing of
administration, as well as dosage used (sufficient for
inhibition but not toxic), need to be standardized, and offtarget effects need to be taken into account for meaningful
comparison between studies. A detailed description of
problems associated the use of lysosomal inhibitors can
be found in [104].
Liposomal formulations of Dox have been used to
reduce Dox accumulation and toxicity on healthy tissues,
and there is evidence from clinical applications that this
approach may reduce heart injury [107, 108]. To our
knowledge, there are no reports as to how liposomal Dox
would affect autophagy in the heart. One may speculate
that since heart muscle- associated Dox concentration is
reduced when Dox is administered in liposomes [109],
Dox-induced deleterious effects, including dysregulated
autophagy, would be reduced.

Various mechanisms mediating the mitophagy
process have been described, and reviewed recently
in references [111-114]. Specific proteins at the
mitochondrial outer membrane can act as selective
mitophagy ‘receptors’, by possessing the LIR motif which
binds LC3-II and enables mitochondrial engulfment by the
autophagosome [115]. Two major pathways to mitophagy
have been described for cardiomyocytes, the PINK1/
Parkin pathway, and a Parkin-independent pathway, the
Bnip3/Nix pathway. Several Parkin-independet mitophagy
pathways have been described for various cell types but
have not been identified in the cardiac system.
PINK1/Parkin
Parkin-mediated mitophagy occurs in damaged/
depolarized mitochondria: depolarization of the outer
mitochondrial membrane promotes the stabilization of
PINK1, a mitochondrial serine/threonine kinase, at the
mitochondrial outer membrane. PINK1 binds to Parkin,
facilitating its translocation to mitochondria. Moreover,
PINK1 phosphorylates ubiquitin, which is required for the
ubiquitin ligase activity of Parkin [113]. Once recruited
to mitochondria, Parkin ubiquitinates mitochondrial
surface proteins such as Mitofusin 1, 2 (Mfn1, 2), voltage
dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1), and MIRO, a
GTPase enzyme facilitating mitochondrial transport [116].
Parkin-dependent ubiquitination of Mfn and MIRO leads
to proteasome degradation of these proteins and prevents
mitochondrial re-fusion, keeping mitochondria in a
fragmented state, stopping mitochondrial movement and
promoting mitochondrial autophagic removal [113, 114,
117].
Expression levels of Parkin/PINK1, taken as
indicators of mitophagy potential, were reported to show
a biphasic response post-Dox in mouse hearts [118]:
decreased Parkin/PINK1, at 5 days post Dox suggested
decreased Parkin-mediated mitophagy at this time point.
At 2 weeks post-Dox, however, expression of these
proteins bounced back and reached levels even higher
than those of untreated controls. Increased expression
of a protein, Fis1, associated with mitochondrial fission
and increased mitophagy, was also observed [118].
There is some evidence that the mitochondrial fission
and mitophagy inhibitor peptide mdivi-1 prevented the
deleterious effects of Dox[119], which would suggest that
excessive mitophagy contributes to Dox-toxicity.
Another group has reported that the Doxinduced increase in p53, which can interact with and
sequester Parkin to the cytosol, resulted in decreased
Parkin translocation to mitochondria and decreased
mitophagic potential, which was proposed to contribute
to Dox-toxicity by allowing the accumulation of damaged
mitochondria. This effect of Dox was not observed in
p53-defficient mice, and could be counter-acted by overexpression of Parkin in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes
[52]. It should be noted that Hoshino and colleagues [52]

Mitophagy and Dox
Myocardial contractile function and cell survival
depend on a high content of healthy mitochondria to
ensure sufficient ATP production through oxidative
phosphorylation. Defective mitochondria are targeted
for autophagic elimination (mitophagy), a process which
contributes to the mitochondrial quality control system.
Mitophagy plays a fundamental role in cardiomyocyte
survival under various cellular stresses. Additional and
possibly overlapping processes involved in mitochondrial
quality control include the ubiquitin/proteasomemediated elimination of mitochondrial proteins; and the
elimination of toxic mitochondrial contents via formation
of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDV) [110]. The latter
is reported to occur more frequently than mitophagy under
baseline conditions, and to represent a fast response to
Dox-induced oxidative stress, preceding mitophagy [86].

was reported that SSM accumulated more Dox than IFM;
furthermore, Dox resulted in an increase in PINK1 and
a decrease in p62/SQSTM1 in the IFM population only,
while Parkin content was not changed in either SSM or
IFM. The authors interpreted the results as Dox-induced
upregulation of Parkin mediated mitophagy in IFM
[126]. However, one can speculate that Dox mediates
inhibition of Parkin translocation to the IFM with impaired
subsequent p62/SQSTM1 translocation as has also been
described in [52].
The relative contribution of the various mitophagy
receptors to baseline and Dox-associated mitophagy
remains to be determined. One promising approach would
be to use the Keima-mouse, expressing a mitochondriatargeted form of the fluorescent protein Keima [127],
to examine how mitophagy is affected post-Dox.
Fluorescence of the Keima protein is pH sensitive and
changes color in the acidic environment of the lysosomes.
This mouse model has already demonstrated that baseline
levels of cardiac mitophagy are high relative to other
organs [127], and could provide valuable information
about Dox-associated mitophagy over time, within
myocytes and in the various regions of the heart. The
mt-Keima mouse could also address the effect of various
pre-conditioning, cardioprotective manipulation on the
mitophagy process before and after Dox-administration.

Bnip3 and Bnip3L/NIX
Two members of BH3-only family proteins,
Bnip3 and Bnip3L/NIX which have been associated
with apoptotic and necrotic cell death, and the induction
of permeability transition, can also act as mitophagy
receptors. These proteins contain an LIR motif which
enables them to interact with LC3-II on the surface of
the autophagosomes. Unlike Parkin, the translocation of
Bnip3 to mitochondria does not require loss of membrane
potential. The ability of Bnip3 to induce permeability
transition pore opening and cell death can be distinct
from its ability to promote autophagy; these outcomes
are likely modulated by distinct phosphorylation states.
The phosphorylation of serines 23 and 17, adjacent to the
LIR domain, was reported to promote mitophagy [120];
on the other hand, phosphorylation of C-terminal Bnip3
residues can block cell death, without affecting autophagic
elimination [120]. Currently, it is not known how Dox
affects Bnip3 or Bip3L/NIX- dependent mitophagy in
cardiomyocytes. Following Dox, Bnip3 is reported to
translocate to mitochondria and promote permeability
transition and depolarization [47]. Depolarization would
be expected to recruit Parkin to mitochondria. In fact,
the Bnip3-mediated mitophagy is reported to depend on
Parkin recruitment in cardiomyocytes [121].
FUNDC1, an outer mitochondrial membrane protein
with an LIR motif enabling it to interact with LC3-II has
also been linked to mitophagy, although only hypoxiainduced mitophagy has been studied; the role of Dox on
FUNDC1 mediated mitophagy remains to be determined
[113, 114]. Cardiolipin, which is induced by Dox to
translocate to the outer mitochondrial membrane, could
also serve as another mitophagy ‘receptor’. An illustration
of the various mitophagy receptors is shown in Fig.3. A
member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, Bcl-2 like-13 ,
possessing a LIR motif, was also identified in mammalian
cells as a mitophagy receptor[122]
There is currently some controversy as to the
relevance of the PINK1/Parkin pathway in cardiac
baseline or stress-induced mitophagy [123, 124]. A
notion that may explain differences between studies is
the possibility that different mitophagy receptors could
target different mitochondrial populations within the
myocytes. Adult cardiomyocytes possess subsarcolemmal
(SSM) and interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM), with distinct
morphological and functional properties as well as distinct
sensitivities to calcium overload [125]. There is currently
limited information regarding how these different
mitochondrial populations may be targeted for mitophagy,
before or after Dox. Recently, a group studied the effects
of Dox on SSM and IFM in adult female rats [126]. It

CONCLUDING REMARKS
There is no doubt that a systematic approach will be
required to elucidate the role of autophagy and mitophagy
in Dox-induced pathology, taking into account potential
sex and ageing- related effects. Our overall conclusions
based on available evidence are summarized in Fig.4.
One can surmise that Dox leads to an over-activation of
autophagy initiation while at the same time preventing
autophagy completion due to deleterious effects on
lysosomes. The resulting accumulation of un-degraded
cargo which promotes ROS overproduction would be
expected to be toxic to the cells, contributing to cell
death. It would seem that Dox dysregulates endogenous
mitophagy, and MDV production, in a manner that
contributes to Dox toxicity. Since Dox promotes Parkin
depletion in a manner similar to the ageing process one
can conclude that Dox may selectively diminish Parkin/
PINK1-mediated mitophagy. At the same time, Doxinduced Bnip3, and Bnip3L/NIX upregulation would
suggest that Bnip3/NIX receptor mediated mitophagy
takes over, contributing to Dox-cardiotoxicity.
