SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Tumorigenesis is associated with increased glucose consumption and lipogenesis, but how these
pathways are interlinked is unclear. Here, we delineate a pathway in which EGFR signaling, by
increasing glucose uptake, promotes N-glycosylation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein
(SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and consequent activation of SREBP-1, an
endoplasmic reticulum-bound transcription factor with central roles in lipid metabolism.
Glycosylation stabilizes SCAP and reduces its association with Insig-1, allowing movement of
SCAP/SREBP to the Golgi and consequent proteolytic activation of SREBP. Xenograft studies
reveal that blocking SCAP N-glycosylation ameliorates EGFRvIII-driven glioblastoma growth.
Thus, SCAP acts as key glucose-responsive protein linking oncogenic signaling and fuel
availability to SREBP-dependent lipogenesis. Targeting SCAP N-glycosylation may provide a
promising means of treating malignancies and metabolic diseases.

INTRODUCTION
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Elevated lipogenesis is a common patho-physiological characteristic of cancer and
metabolic diseases (Guo et al., 2013; Menendez and Lupu, 2007; Moon et al., 2012; Ru et
al., 2013; Tang et al., 2011). In these processes, a critical regulatory role is played by sterol
regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), a family of transcription factors that control
the expression of genes important for the uptake and synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids and
phospholipids (Goldstein et al., 2006; Jeon and Osborne, 2012; Nohturfft and Zhang, 2009).
There are two mammalian SREBP genes, SREBF1 and SREBF2. SREBP-1a and −1c, which
are encoded by SREBF1 with different N-terminus (~20 amino acids) owing to their mRNAs
being transcribed from different transcriptional start sites, mainly regulate the expression of
genes required for fatty acid synthesis. SREBP-2 is encoded by SREBF2 and is responsible
for the synthesis of cholesterol (Goldstein et al., 2006; Horton et al., 2002; Horton et al.,
2003). Recent evidence shows that the nuclear form of SREBP-1 is highly upregulated in a
variety of malignancies (Ettinger et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2009b; Li et al., 2014). Targeting
SREBP-1 has become a promising therapeutic strategy to treat cancer and other metabolic
syndromes (Griffiths et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2014; Kamisuki et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2011).
SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 are synthesized as inactive precursors bound to the membrane of
the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through two transmembrane domains (Goldstein et al.,
2006). SREBP activation requires proteolytic release of an N-terminal fragment that
constitutes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (Goldstein et al., 2006; Wang et al.,
1994). Currently, post-translational activation of SREBPs is best understood in the context

of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (Radhakrishnan et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2007). When
cholesterol level is high, it binds to SREBP-cleavage activating protein (SCAP), inducing a
conformational change that promotes binding to ER-anchored insulin induced gene protein
(Insig), thus preventing Golgi transport and activation of SREBPs (Adams et al., 2004; Sun
et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2002). When the cholesterol concentration drops, the SCAP/SREBP
complex dissociates from Insig, allowing vesicular transport to the Golgi where SREBPs are
exposed to proteases that release the transcriptionally active N-terminal fragment (Goldstein
et al., 2006; Nohturfft et al., 2000; Sun et al., 2007).

Glucose is a major resource for de novo lipid synthesis. In cancer cells, elevated glucose
consumption is often accompanied by increased lipogenesis (Guo et al., 2013; Menendez
and Lupu, 2007), and the link between glucose supply and SREBP-1 activation seems
common in both physiological and patho-physiological conditions (Guillet-Deniau et al.,
2004; Hasty et al., 2000; Horton et al., 1998; Kaplan et al., 2008). In a previous study we
showed that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via PI3K/Akt signaling activated
SREBP-1 in glioblastoma (GBM) cells (Guo et al., 2009b; Guo et al., 2011). While a
number of studies have demonstrated that elevated EGFR signaling is coupled with
enhanced glucose uptake and lipogenesis in tumorigenesis (Babic et al., 2013; Cloughesy et
al., 2014; Guo et al., 2009a; Guo et al., 2009b), the molecular mechanisms that underlie the
cross-talk between the altered glucose and lipid metabolism in tumorigensis remain largely
unknown. In this study, we test the hypothesis that SCAP acts as a key glucose-responsive
protein to integrate oncogenic signaling and fuel availability for modulation of SREBPdependent lipogenesis.

RESULTS

Glucose activates SREBPs via upregulation of SCAP

Author Manuscript

To investigate how glucose and sterol signaling are integrated during SREBP activation,
human GBM U87 cells that have been shown to contain a high SREBP-1 activity (Guo et
al., 2009b; Guo et al., 2011), were grown in the absence or presence of glucose and sterols
(cholesterol/25-hydroxycholesterol), and SREBP processing was analyzed by western blot
and immunofluorescence microscopy. We found that in the absence of glucose, only the ERbound SREBP-1 precursor could be clearly detected, even in cells that were deprived of
sterols by removal of serum (Figure 1A). While glucose supplement modestly activated
SREBP-1 in the presence of sterols (as assessed by the appearance of the N-terminal
cleavage fragment of SREBP-1), maximal SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 cleavage required both
glucose supplement and low sterols in the absence or presence of serum (Figures 1A and
S1A). Moreover, glucose activated SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 in a dose- and time-dependent
manner and increased the protein levels of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and low-density
lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), the genes encoding both of which are downstream targets for
SREBP-1 (Figures 1B, 1C, S1A and S1B) (Bennett et al., 1995; Yokoyama et al., 1993).
Furthermore, real-time qPCR analysis showed that glucose stimulation enhanced both
SREBP-1a and −1c expression and activated the expression of SREBP-1 or SREBP-2
regulated genes involved in lipid metabolism (Figures S1C). Using confocal fluorescence
imaging, we found that stimulation of U87 cells with glucose promoted nuclear translocation

of transgenic GFP-SREBP-1 (Figures 1D and S1D). Translocation of endogenous SREBP-1
into the nucleus in response to glucose stimulation was demonstrated by
immunofluorescence (Figures 1E and S1E). In contrast, under glucose-deprived condition,
even with removal of sterols, SREBP-1 was still retained in the ER membrane as shown by
its co-staining with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), an ER membrane protein (Figures 1E
and S1E) (Uehara et al., 2006). These data suggest that glucose is required for SREBP
activation under conditions of sterol deprivation.

Author Manuscript

SREBP stability, transport to the Golgi and cleavage require formation of a complex
between SREBP and SCAP (Nohturfft et al., 2000; Rawson et al., 1999; Sakai et al., 1998).
We found that glucose-induced cleavages of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were accompanied by
increase of SCAP protein levels in GBM cells (Figures 1F, S1A and S1B). Similar results
were observed in various other cancer cell lines in which both SREBP-1 and −2 were
activated (see Figures S1F). HEK293T cells expressing GFP-SCAP and full length FlagSREBP-1a, −1c or HA-SREBP-2 displayed glucose-dependent upregulation of GFP-SCAP
and activation of all three SREBP isoforms, which were detected by increased N-terminal
fragment of epitope-tagged SREBP in the nuclear fraction under conditions of glucose
supplement (Figures 1G and S1G). We found that knockdown of SCAP reduced glucosemediated activation of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 (Figure 1H).

Author Manuscript

Because liver X receptor (LXR), a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription
factors, promotes the expression of SREBP-1c upon activation (Repa et al., 2000), and
glucose is able to activate LXR in hepatocytes (Mitro et al., 2007), we sought to examine
whether LXR possibly involves in glucose-activated SCAP/SREBP signaling. As shown in
Figures S1A–S1C, our data show that both the protein and mRNA levels of ATP-binding
cassette activating proteins ABCA1 and ABCG1, which are major downstream targets of
LXR (Zelcer and Tontonoz, 2006), were not significantly upregulated by glucose
supplement in U87 cells within 12 hr, demonstrating that LXR was not strongly activated by
glucose in GBM cells. In contrast, SCAP protein and SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 cleavage were
enhanced by glucose stimulation (Figure S1A and S1B). Together, these data suggest that
LXR was not involved in glucose-mediated SREBP signaling pathway.
Collectively, these data demonstrate that glucose availability constrains SREBP activity by
controlling the levels of SCAP.
Glucose promotes SCAP N-glycosylation and enhances its stability

Author Manuscript

To explore the mechanisms of how glucose enhances SCAP protein levels and activates
SREBP, the intermediate metabolite, pyruvate or lactate of the glycolysis pathway or Nacetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) (Figure 2A),
was added to GBM U87 cells in glucose- and sterol-free medium, respectively. The data
showed that GlcNAc was as effective as glucose at enhancing SCAP protein levels and
promoting SREBP-1 cleavage, while pyruvate and lactate had no effect (Figure 2B). Upon
exposure of cells to an inhibitor of HBP (azaserine, AZA) or to an inhibitor of N-glycan
synthesis (tunicamycin, Tuni), both SCAP protein levels and SREBP-1 cleavage were
reduced, while an inhibitor of O-glycosylation (BADGP) had no effect (Figures 2C and
S2A–S2D). Immunofluorescence imaging showed that glucose-induced Golgi and nuclear

translocation of SREBP-1 were largely blocked by AZA and tunicamycin (Figures 2D and
S2E). As expected, addition of GlcNAc restored AZA treatment-reduced SCAP protein
levels and SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 cleavages in U87 cells (Figure S2F). These data suggest
that the effects of glucose on SCAP and SREBP were likely mediated by an induction of
protein N-glycosylation.

Nohturfft et al. showed that SCAP protein carries three N-linked oligosaccharides at
asparagine (N) positions N263, N590 and N641 and those mutations of one or two of these
asparagines had no apparent effect on the function of SCAP. However, a version of SCAP
with all three asparagines mutated to glutamine (NNN to QQQ) could not be detected,
suggesting that N-glycosylation is important for the stability of SCAP (Nohturfft et al.,
1998). Therefore, we asked whether glucose might control the levels of SCAP by affecting
its glycosylation. Furthermore, the role for N-glycosylation in SCAP/SREBP function has
not been extensively explored.

We adopted the approach of Nohturfft et al. and examined the effects of glucose on SCAP
N-glycosylation in HEK293T cells and CHO cells (Nohturfft et al., 1998). SCAP contains a
luminal region (a.a. 540–707) with two N-glycosylation sites that is protected from
proteolysis when intact membranes are treated with trypsin (Nohturfft et al., 1998). This
luminal fragment has a molecular weight of ~30 kDa that is small enough to allow the
resolution of individual glycosylated variants of SCAP by SDS-PAGE (Figures 2E, upper
panel and S2G). Glucose deprivation for 12 hr resulted in two weaker bands that correspond
to SCAP fragments carrying one or two oligosaccharides in HEK293T cells expressing
GFP-SCAP (Figure 2E, upper panel), indicating that the level of SCAP N-glycosylation was
decreased under low glucose condition that was correlated with reduced total GFP-SCAP
protein (Figures 2E, lower panel and S2H). Removal of the oligosaccharides by treatment
with endoglycosidase (PNGase) reduced the apparent molecular weight to the unglycosylated form of SCAP (Nohturfft et al., 1998). Notably, in the presence of glucose,
high amount of fully glycosylated form of SCAP and total GFP-SCAP protein were detected
(Figures 2E, S2G and S2H), which were associated with elevated SREBP activation
(Figures 1F, 1G and S1G). Supplementing the culture medium with GlcNAc enhanced
SCAP glycosylation and increased total GFP-SCAP protein to a level similar to that found
upon glucose treatment (Figures 2E). Furthermore, AZA or tunicamycin treatment blocked
glucose-promoted SCAP N-glycosylation and reduced GFP-SCAP levels in HEK293 cells
and endogenous SCAP levels in CHO cells (Figures 2F, 2G, S2G and S2H), and addition of
GlcNAc restored AZA treatment-mediated reduction of SCAP N-glycosylation and total
GFP-SCAP protein to levels similar to cells exposed to glucose supplement alone (Figure
2F). In GBM cells treated with tunicamycin, the endogenous SCAP protein level was
reduced (Figures 2H and S2C). Co-treatment with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, but not
protease inhibitors (combination of E64D, Pepstatin and Leupepsin), restored the SCAP
protein to a level similar to that when cells exposed to glucose alone (Figures 2H and 2I).
Taken together, these data demonstrate that glucose deprivation-led reduction of SCAP
protein levels is caused by proteasome-dependent degradation.
To examine the effect of N-glycosylation on SCAP stability, we generated a mutant form of
SCAP by replacing all three asparagines (N263, N590 and N641) with glutamines (NNN to

QQQ). We added a GFP tag to the N-terminal end of SCAP and used a strong CMV
promoter to drive its expression in HEK293T cells. This enabled us to produce measurable
amount of GFP-SCAP-QQQ protein, overcoming the problem of Nohturfft et al. faced
(Nohturfft et al., 1998). Compared with the wild-type protein (GFP-SCAP-NNN), lower
levels of GFP-SCAP-QQQ were detected (Figure 2J), suggesting that the un-glycosylated
SCAP proteins are less stable and presumably are more susceptible to proteasomal
degradation. Indeed, treatment of cells with MG132 significantly restored GFP-SCAP-QQQ
protein levels (Figure 2K).
Glucose-mediated glycosylation promotes SCAP trafficking to the Golgi leading to SREBP
activation

Author Manuscript

We wondered whether N-glycosylation altered the association of SCAP with Insig and
thereby promoted SCAP/SREBP trafficking to the Golgi in the absence of sterols. To
address this, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with Myc-Insig-1 and GFP-SCAP or GFPvector to determine their interaction in response to glucose and tunicamycin treatment. We
found that glucose treatment reduced the association of GFP-SCAP with Myc-Insig-1
compared with glucose-deprived condition (Figure 3A). Further, blocking N-glycosylation
by tunicamycin restored the binding of GFP-SCAP to Myc-Insig-1 (Figure 3A). These data
suggest that N-glycosylation modification by glucose reduced the binding of SCAP to
Insig-1. To test if this affected the SCAP/SREBP trafficking to the Golgi, the subcellular
distribution of GFP-SCAP was examined by confocal microscopy. The data show that
glucose stimulation promoted the GFP-SCAP trafficking to the Golgi, which was blocked by
inhibition of N-glycosylation with tunicamycin (Figures 3B and S3A).

Author Manuscript

Data with transient expression of GFP-SCAP-QQQ mutant and Myc-Insig-1 in HEK293T
cells further supported the notion that N-glycosylation reduces SCAP binding to Insig-1 and
subsequent SCAP/SREBP trafficking to the Golgi. We found that GFP-SCAP-QQQ
displayed stronger association with Myc-Insig-1 compared with GFP-SCAP-NNN (Figure
3C). While GFP-SCAP-NNN promoted trafficking of Flag-SREBP-1c to the Golgi and
subsequent translocation to the nucleus, the GFP-SCAP-QQQ mutant failed to do so
(Figures 3D and S3B).

Author Manuscript

The contribution of individual N-glycosylation sites to SCAP function and trafficking was
further investigated in HEK293T and U87 cells expressing the GFP-SCAP protein harboring
single, double or triple mutations. Our data showed that none of the single or double
mutations in SCAP impaired the trafficking and activation of Flag-SERBP-1c in response to
glucose stimulation (Figures 3E–3G, S3C and S3D). These data were consistent with the
early studies by the Brown and Goldstein laboratory which demonstrated that mutations of
one or two N-glycosylation sites produced negligible effects on SREBP-2 activation
(Nohturfft et al., 1998). Interestingly, we found that the triple mutant GFP-SCAP-QQQ was
unable to traffic to the Golgi and failed to activate epitope-tagged SREBP-1a, −1c and
SREBP-2 (Figures 3F, 3G, S3C and S3E–S3G). Thus, even though maintenance of a single
glycosylation site on SCAP appeared to be sufficient for its biological function (Nohturfft et
al., 1998), complete abolition of all glycosylation sites on SCAP disrupted the exit pathway
for the SCAP/SREBP complex from ER to the Golgi.

Elegant studies by Brown and Goldstein laboratory established that sterols are critical
factors in the regulation of SCAP trafficking and SREBP activation (Goldstein et al 2006).
We conducted similar studies and found that incubation of cells with sterols could block
glucose-mediated SCAP trafficking and SREBP-1 nuclear translocation (Figure S3H and
S3I). Overexpressing Myc-Insig-1 or increasing sterol concentration reduced glucosemediated SREBP-1 activation (Figure S3J and S3K). While these data are consistent with
the early work of Brown and Goldstein laboratory, the present findings suggest that glucose
is indispensable for SCAP/SREBP trafficking and function. Our data support that Nglycosylation relieves SCAP association with Insig, leading to SCAP/SREBP trafficking to
Golgi and subsequent SREBP activation; and sterols could antagonize glucose function on
SCAP trafficking and SREBP activation.

EGFR signaling activates SREBP-1 by enhancing the glucose uptake, SCAP protein levels
and N-glycosylation
EGFR signaling has been shown to enhance glucose uptake and activate SREBP-1 (Babic et
al., 2013; Guo et al., 2009a; Guo et al., 2009b). Based on our observation that SREBP
activation in sterol-deprived condition was fully depended on glucose (Figure 1), we tested
whether EGFR-mediated SREBP-1 activation also required glucose. As shown in Figure 4A,
EGF stimulation was unable to promote the nuclear translocation of SREBP-1 in the absence
of glucose, and addition of glucose could restore EGF-mediated SREBP-1 nuclear
translocation. Western blotting showed that EGF stimulation had no effect on SREBP-1
cleavage in glucose-free media, even though EGFR-PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway
was strongly activated as evident by the upregulation of p-EGFR, p-Akt and p-S6 (Figures
4B and S4A). In contrast, EGF stimulation in the presence of glucose promoted the cleavage
of SREBP-1 (Figures 4B and S4A).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Using 14C-glucose radioisotope measurements, we found that EGF stimulation led to
significant increase of glucose uptake in U87/EGFR cells (Figure 4C). While EGF
stimulation did not appear to affect the SCAP protein level in the absence of glucose,
additive effect of glucose and EGF-dependent enhancement of SCAP expression was
observed (Figures 4D and S4A). Moreover, the EGF-induced changes in SCAP expression
was correlated with SREBP-1 activation, as reflected by the increased appearance of the
SREBP-1 N terminal fragment in the nuclear fraction (Figures 4D and S4A). Moreover,
increase in glucose uptake by insulin in HepG2 cells, also upregulated SCAP protein and
activated SREBP-1 (Figures S4B and S4C), suggesting that the activation of glucose-SCAPSREBP signaling pathway could be induced by various other growth factors. We then
knocked down the expression of SCAP in U87/EGFR cells in order to examine whether the
effect of EGF on SREBP-1 activation was mediated by the Glucose-SCAP axis. As shown
in Figure 4E, knockdown of SCAP completely abolished EGF-mediated activation of
SREBP-1.
Inhibition of the HBP pathway by AZA or suppression of N-glycosylation by tunicamycin
blocked EGF-mediated nuclear translocation of SREBP-1, whereas the O-glycosylation
inhibitor BADGP treatment failed to do so (Figure 5A). Western blotting showed that AZA
or tunicamycin treatment blocked EGFR signaling-dependent increase in SREBP-1

cleavage, whereas no changes were observed by BADGP treatment (Figure 5B). Moreover,
EGF-mediated upregulation of SCAP was reduced by AZA or tunicamycin treatment, but
not by the BADGP treatment (Figure 5B). We incubated U87/EGFR cells with 14C-glucose
and measured isotope labeled lipid products, and found that AZA or tunicamycin treatment
significantly reduced EGFR signaling-dependent increase in de novo lipid synthesis (Figure
5C). These results demonstrate that N-glycosylation was a key mediator for EGFR
signaling-mediated increase in SCAP level and subsequent activation of SREBP-1.

We then assessed the effect of EGF stimulation on SCAP glycosylation. Stimulation of cells
with EGF led to the increase of the total and the N-glycosylated GFP-SCAP protein when
compared with control and both were blocked by tunicamycin (Figure 5D). In correlation,
EGF stimulation also upregulated SREBP-1 activity, which was inhibited by tunicamycin
(Figure 5D, upper panel). Similar to the studies in Figure 3G, we measured the effect of
EGF on SREBP-1 function in U87/EGFR cells expressing GFP-SCAP-NNN or GFP-SCAPQQQ. We found that cells expressing GFP-SCAP-NNN showed enhanced SREBP-1
activation in response to EGF stimulation, whereas cells expressing GFP-SCAP-QQQ
showed reduced SREBP-1 activation even below the levels observed with cells expressing
GFP alone (as control) (Figure 5E). Interestingly, biochemical studies showed that the other
signaling components for EGFR, e.g. p-EGFR, p-AKT and p-S6, were not affected by
overexpression of either GFP-SCAP-NNN or GFP-SCAP-QQQ in U87/EGFR cells (Figure
5E). Taken together, our data show that EGFR-dependent SREBP-1 activation is mediated
by upregulation of SCAP and its N-glycosylation through enhancing glucose uptake.
Impairment of SCAP N-glycosylation suppresses GBM tumor growth

Author Manuscript

To determine the effect of EGFR on SCAP/SREBP-1 function in tumorigenesis, we
employed a cell culture model with stable expression of EGFRvIII, a constitutively active
form of EGFR with enhanced activation of PI3K-Akt signaling that leads to aggressive
tumorigenesis (Guo et al., 2009b; Huang et al., 1997). Western blot revealed that U87/
EGFRvIII cells displayed elevated SCAP protein levels and enhanced SREBP-1 activation
associated with upregulated p-Akt and p-S6 levels (Figure 6A). Based on this observation,
we asked whether EGFRvIII-mediated tumorigenesis is mediated by enhanced SCAP
expression and its glycosylation.

Author Manuscript

We established a stable U87/EGFRvIII cell line with knockdown of SCAP (U87/EGFRvIIIshSCAP). Western blotting showed that knockdown of SCAP reduced SREBP-1 activation
(Figure 6B), and which significantly reduced tumor growth in mice flank compared with the
shRNA control group (Figure 6C). To assess the potential of these modified GBM cells to
form orthotopic tumors, shSCAP or shControl cells were implanted into mouse brain. A
Kaplan-Meier plot showed that reducing SCAP level significantly prolonged the overall
survival of GBM-bearing mice (Figure 6D).
We next examined whether impairment of SCAP N-glycosylation had any effect on GBM
tumorigenesis. For this purpose, GFP-SCAP-NNN, GFP-SCAP-QQQ, or GFP (as control)
was transiently expressed in U87/EGFRvIII cells. The data showed that the expression of
GFP-SCAP-NNN enhanced whereas GFP-SCAP-QQQ reduced SREBP-1 activation,
compared with cells transfected with GFP (Figure 6E), suggesting that GFP-SCAP-QQQ

had a dominant negative effect on SREBP-1 activation. Next, these transfected cells were
implanted into mouse flanks. As shown in Figure 6F, GFP-SCAP-NNN expression
promoted GBM tumor growth compared with the GFP control; whereas GFP-SCAP-QQQ
expression significantly reduced the GBM tumor growth.

Author Manuscript

Finally, to determine the effect of SCAP N-glycosylation on GBM intracranial tumor
growth, we used a U87/EGFRvIII cell line with stable expression of luciferase, which allows
the visualization of tumor in mouse brain using luminescence imaging (Wojton et al., 2013).
The data showed that the expression of GFP-SCAP-NNN promoted tumor growth whereas
the expression of GFP-SCAP-QQQ significantly reduced tumor growth (Figure 6G).
Moreover, overexpression of GFP-SCAP-NNN reduced the overall survival of GBMbearing mice (Figure 6H). Inversely, impairment of SCAP N-glycosylation significantly
prolonged the overall survival of mice (Figure 6H). Collectively, these data demonstrate that
N-glycosylation on SCAP is a critical factor for EGFRvIII-induced GBM tumorigenesis.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Malignant cells, in general, have high rates of de novo lipid synthesis (Currie et al., 2013;
Guo et al., 2013; Menendez and Lupu, 2007). Since solid tumors often reside in an
environment with fluctuant nutrient supply (Ackerman and Simon, 2014; Gullino et al.,
1967; Hirayama et al., 2009), they must develop adaptive mechanisms to preserve energy
for maintenance of tumor cell survival under conditions of low glucose supply. Proper
gauging of glucose levels and lipid synthesis is not only critical for tumor growth and
survival, but also for normal cell function under stress conditions. In this study, we
demonstrate that SCAP acts as a key glucose-responsive protein to orchestrate fuel
availability and sterol levels for control of SREBP function in lipid synthesis. We show that
glucose controls N-glycosylation of SCAP, which is indispensable for SCAP/SREBP
trafficking from ER to the Golgi and for the nuclear activation of SREBPs (Figure 7). This
finding renovates our current understanding of the regulation of SREBP function in
physiology and patho-physiology. Elegant studies by Brown and Goldstein demonstrated
that sterols act as negative regulators for SCAP/SREBP trafficking (Goldstein et al., 2006),
and ~5% decrease of cholesterol in ER membrane is sufficient to trigger the activation of
SREBP (Radhakrishnan et al., 2008). Such a tight regulation mechanism necessitates the
participation of additional cellular factors to coordinate with sterols for fine tune of SREBP
function in normal and patho-physiological conditions. Our study unravels the important
function of glucose in controlling lipid metabolism in tumorigenesis, linking EGFR
signaling to glucose uptake and SCAP/SREBP activation (Figure 7).

Activation of SREBP relies on SCAP-escorted trafficking from ER to the Golgi
(Espenshade et al., 1999; Goldstein et al., 2006). Sterols serve as negative regulators
enhancing SCAP binding to Insig to retain the SCAP/SREBP complex in ER membrane
(Goldstein et al., 2006). In this study, we show that in glucose-deficient condition, removal
of sterols was unable to relieve SCAP binding to Insig-1 and trigger exit of SCAP/SREBP
from ER. Supplement of glucose promoted SCAP N-glycosylation and SCAP/SREBP
trafficking to the Golgi and consequent SREBP activation. We show that the interaction
between SCAP and Insig-1 is reduced when SCAP is glycosylated. Studies by Brown and

Goldstein have shown that Insig is a sterol sensor that negatively regulates SCAP interaction
with SREBP (Goldstein 2006). Our data are consistent with their idea, as we show that even
in the presence of glucose, sterol still exerts its control of SCAP/SREBP trafficking and
subsequent SREBP activation. Thus, glucose functions as a prerequisite activator for control
of SCAP trafficking and SREBP activation. Since sterol can still block SCAP/SREBP
signaling complex, future studies will be required to examine how glucose communicates
with sterol in orchestrating the cross-talk between energy supply and lipid metabolism in
physiology and cancer biology.

There are three N-glycosylation sites on SCAP, one located in loop 1 (N263) and two in
loop 7 (N590 and N641), and both loops reside in the inner lumen of ER (Nohturfft et al.,
1998). Interestingly, mutation in any one or two sites of N-glycosylation was unable to
affect SCAP trafficking and SREBP function. This observation was consistent with previous
report by Nohturfft et al., who demonstrated that as long as one N-glycosylation site is
present on SCAP, its control of SREBP-2 is unperturbed (Nohturfft et al., 1998). Here we
tested the hypothesis that the presence of any single glycosylation site on SCAP is sufficient
for SCAP/SREBP trafficking and activation. We found that even though presence of a single
glycosylation site on SCAP appeared to be sufficient for its biological function, complete
abolition of all glycosylation sites on SCAP disrupted the exit pathway for the SCAP/
SREBP complex from ER to the Golgi. This further supports the notion that specific
recognition of the glycosylation motif may provide a mechanism for modulation of the
Insig/SCAP/SREBP interaction. Clearly, identification of the binding motif for Insig or
SCAP for N-linked oligosaccharide will require further studies.

Our previous studies revealed that SREBP-1 is activated by EGFR-PI3K-Akt signaling
pathway, but mTORC1 seems not involved (Guo et al., 2009b; Guo et al., 2011). Studies by
other investigators reported that PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 signaling regulates SREBP-1
activation (Du et al., 2006; Porstmann et al., 2005; Yecies et al., 2011). Therefore, the
mechanisms that underlie the oncogeneic signaling to SREBP-1 function remain unclear. In
the present study, we show that in the absence of glucose, EGF cannot activate SREBP-1,
even though other downstream signaling components (e.g. p-Akt, p-S6) remain upregulated.
This suggests that EGFR-mediated control of SREBP-1 is fully dependent on glucose. We
also examined mTORC1 activity by checking its downstream effectors p-S6 and total S6
levels in the absence or presence of serum. The data show that the levels of p-S6 and total
S6 were not significantly changed by glucose withdrawal within 12 hr time window. In
contrast, the levels of SCAP and SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 activation were reduced.
Moreover, in the absence of glucose, even growth factor (EGF or insulin) strongly activated
mTORC1, but failed to activate SCAP/SREBP signaling. Take together, these data
demonstrate that glucose, not mTORC1, plays a critical role in regulating SCAP/SREBP
signaling.
Our study revealed that EGFR signaling via promoting glucose uptake enhances SCAP Nglycosylation and its protein levels to activate SREBP-1. This finding provides a plausible
explanation for the conundrum faced by the tumor cells: Under rich nutrient environment,
oncogenic signaling via hijacking glucose import-SCAP N-glycosylation-SREBP-1
activation metabolic pathway enhances lipogenesis and promotes rapid tumor growth. Once

the glucose level drops, SCAP loses N-glycosylation and disconnects oncogenic signaling
with SREBP-1, leading to reduced lipogenesis and thereby preserving limited energy
sources for tumor cell survival. These data demonstrate the plasticity and survival capability
of tumor cells in facing harsh nutrient microenvironment.
Complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms of SCAP/SREBP trafficking and its
relationship to fuel supply and growth signaling may help design effective therapeutic
strategies to target lipid metabolism in cancer and other metabolic syndromes.

University Medical Center.
Mouse Luminescence Imaging
Mice implanted with GBM cells expressing luciferase were injected with Luciferin (Perkin
Elmer) solution (15 mg/ml in PBS, dose of 150 mg/kg) by an intraperitoneal route for about
5–15 min. Mice were placed into a clear Plexiglas anesthesia box (2.0–3.0% isoflurane) that
allowed unimpeded visual monitoring of the animals. Animals were then placed on nonfluorescent black paper on the imaging platform of an IVIS Lumina II to reduce background
noise. The imaging chamber was continuously infused with 1–1.5% of isoflurane, and
imaging platform was heated at 37°C to keep the mice warm. Animals were imaged 10 min
after Luciferin injection to ensure consistent photon flux. The imaging experiments were
conducted at OSU Small Animal Imaging Core.

Figure 7. Schematic diagram illustrating EGFR signaling via enhancing glucose uptake
promotes SCAP N-glycosylation leading to SREBP-1 activation

(A) Signaling cascade for EGFR stimulation and glucose uptake to SCAP N-glycosylation
and SREBP-1 activation.
(B) Without glucose, unglycosylated SCAP binds to Insig, leading to retention of SREBP in
the ER. Under this condition, changes in sterol level are insufficient to trigger exit of the
SCAP/SREBP complex from the ER. In the presence of glucose, N-glycosylation of SCAP
leads to increased stability of SCAP and its dissociation from Insig. Thus, the SCAP/SREBP
complex can traffic to the Golgi, resulting in SREBP cleavage and its nuclear function.
Sterols block glucose-mediated SCAP/SREBP trafficking and subsequent SREBP
activation. Elevated EGFR signaling causes increased glucose uptake and SCAP/SREBP
activation to promote tumor growth.
