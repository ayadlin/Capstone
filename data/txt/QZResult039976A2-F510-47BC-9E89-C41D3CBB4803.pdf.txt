ABSTRACT
There is strong evidence supporting the role of the plasminogen activator
system in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), particularly of its uPA
(urokinase plasminogen activator) / uPAR (urokinase plasminogen activator receptor)
and SERPINE1 components. Overexpression of uPA/uPAR and SERPINE1 enhances
tumor cell migration and invasion and plays a key role in metastasis development,
conferring poor prognosis. The apparent paradox of uPA/uPAR and its inhibitor
SERPINE1 producing similar effects is solved by the identification of SERPINE1
activated signaling pathways independent of uPA inhibition. Both uPA/uPAR and
SERPINE1 are directly linked to the induction of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition,
the acquisition of stem cell properties and resistance to antitumor agents. The aim
of this review is to provide insight on the deregulation of these proteins in all these
processes.
We also summarize their potential value as prognostic biomarkers or potential
drug targets in HNSCC patients. Concomitant overexpression of uPA/uPAR and
SERPINE1 is associated with a higher risk of metastasis and could be used to identify
patients that would benefit from an adjuvant treatment. In the future, the specific
inhibitors of uPA/uPAR and SERPINE1, which are still under development, could be
used to design new therapeutic strategies in HNSCCs.

INTRODUCTION

these effects, initial radical surgery has been progressively
replaced by multimodal treatments that combine surgery,
radiation and chemotherapy. Multimodal treatments
have improved loco-regional disease control and organ
preservation in head and neck patients, but five-year
survival remains around 50% [2]. A high percentage of
patients develop recurrences, metastasis or secondary
tumors after treatment, which results in a poor clinical
outcome [4-8].
The molecular mechanisms associated with head
and neck tumor invasion, metastasis, dissemination and
drug resistance remain largely unknown. The identification

Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common
cancer in incidence worldwide [1]. More than 500,000
new cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) are diagnosed each year (http://globocan.iarc.
fr). Two thirds of patients are diagnosed at advanced
stages, as lymph node metastases are often the first
sign of the disease [2]. In advanced stages, surgery can
significantly impact organ function, produce damage to
the structures involved in swallowing and speech, and
greatly reduce patient quality of life [3]. In order to avoid

of new biomarkers associated with tumor spread could be
very useful in classifying patients according to their risk
of recurrence [9]. An appropriate classification would
make it possible to optimize and rationalize treatment,
management and HNSCC patient care after diagnosis [10,
11].
The plasminogen activator (PA) system plays a key
role in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, which
in turn is crucial in the first steps of tumor progression
and spreading [12]. Its main components include the
plasminogen activators (uPA, urokinase plasminogen
activator; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator), the cell
membrane receptor for uPA (uPAR), the plasminogen
activator inhibitors (PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor
1; PAI-2, plasminogen activator inhibitor 2) and plasmin

(Figure 1) [13]. The PA system regulates the generation
of plasmin that results from the activation of plasminogen
by uPA or tPA. The uPAR receptor in turn accumulates
plasminogen conversion at cell surfaces [12]. In addition,
the plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAI-1; PA1-2),
also known as, SERPINE1 and SERPINB2 are the main
inhibitors of uPA and tPA [13, 14].
Plasmin activation is a key factor for fibrinolysis
control and prevents health problems due to the formation
of blood clots. Deregulation of uPA/uPAR and SERPINE1
has been associated with thrombosis, cardiovascular
diseases and alterations of wound healing [14, 15].
Moreover, the PA system effect on cell adhesion and
migration is particularly important in cancer progression.
Active plasmin degrades the ECM directly or indirectly

though the activation of several metalloproteinases [14].
ECM degradation facilitates the migration of tumor cells
to other tissues and structures. SERPINE1 regulates this
process and the adhesion/deadhesion balance of cells
to the ECM, which is essential to control and promote
tumor cell migration [16, 17]. A high expression of uPA/
uPAR and SERPINE1 has been observed in numerous
cancer types, being associated with poor patient prognosis
[12, 18]. In this regard, several studies supporting the
association between the activation of the PA system and
head and neck cancer prognosis have been reported over
the last years.
In this review, we first describe the effect of uPA,
uPAR and SERPINE1 in head and neck cancer cell
migration, metastatic dissemination and drug resistance.
Secondly, we summarize their value as prognostic markers
in patients with HNSCC. Finally, we discuss about the
potential use of SERPINE1, uPAR, uPA and associated
pathways as therapeutic targets.

of cancer cells into the surrounding tissue, as well as their
access to blood and lymph node vessels. α5β6 integrin can
also activate uPA, which facilitates HNSCC cell motility
[27, 29]. uPA and uPAR have been associated with an
increase in the growth of head and neck cancer cells and
with the activation of FAK and ERK1/2 signaling [30,
31]. Thombospondin has also been associated with the
activation of uPA and cell invasion in HNSCC cells [32].
Plasmin cleaves a range of ECM proteins, such laminin
and fibrin, and also activates metalloproteinases, such
as the MMP2, previously associated with an increase of
head and neck cancer cell invasion and metastasis [33-35].
Moreover, uPA and plasmin are involved in the activation
of several growth factors, including HGF/SF and MSP,
TGF-β, and FGF [12].
The expression of uPAR is associated with an
invasive and metastatic phenotype in studies done using
in vivo murine models of head and neck cancer. In oral
squamous cell carcinoma xenografts, the inhibition of
uPAR reduces tumor growth and downregulates the
expression of genes previously associated with metastasis,
such us MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF-C, VEGF-D and
VEGFR-3 [36]. A study conducted using an orthotopic
murine model showed that the overexpression of uPAR
in oral cancer cells generated infiltrative tumors with
undefined margins and cytologic atypia [37]. These
authors showed that the effect of uPAR on tumor cell
invasion was associated with the activation of ERK1/2
MAP kinases and its co-localization with uPA and α3β1
integrin complex. uPAR can also promote the activation
of the Ras-MAPK, Fak, Src and Rac and the PI3K-Akt
pathways that have a significant effect on tumor cell
migration [38]. Using an oral cancer metastatic mouse
model, Zhang et al. showed that the expression of uPAR
in cancer cells isolated from lymph node metastasis was
higher than in cells isolated from primary tumor [39].
In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, a highly metastatic head
and neck cancer [7], uPAR overexpression increases
cell migration and invasion and promotes epithelial-tomesenchymal transition and metastasis [25]. This process
has been associated with the activation of the Jak-Stat
pathway [40].
The inhibition of uPAR using antisense
oligonucleotides reduces the invasiveness and the
metastatic potential of head and neck cancer cells [41, 42].
In summary, most of the studies reported in head
and neck cancer have shown that the overexpression of
uPA/uPAR enhances tumor cell proliferation, migration
and invasion. This effect is due to the activation of plasmin
and ECM degradation, but it could also be the result of the
indirect activation of several signaling pathways with a
key role in tumor progression and metastasis, such as the
PI3K-Akt pathway.

ROLE OF UPA/UPAR IN TUMOR CELL
PROLIFERATION, MIGRATION, INVASION
AND METASTASIS
The uPA gene (Gene ID: 5328; http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/) encodes a 411 amino acid serine protease
that consists of two α and two anti-parallel β strands [19].
This protein is secreted as a zymogen (pro-uPA) that is
activated by cleavage of the peptide bond Lys158-Ile159
[20]. uPA has an amino-terminal EGF-like domain, a
kringle domain, an interdomain linker and a catalytic
domain [21]. The pro-uPA to uPA conversion is catalyzed
by plasmin. Kallikrein, T cell-associated serine proteinase,
cathepsin B, cathepsin L, nerve growth factor-γ, human
mast cell tryptase and prostate specific antigen are other
proteinases that can also catalyze “in vitro” the conversion
of pro-uPA [12]. uPA converts plasminogen to plasmin by
specific cleavage of an Arg-Val bond in plasminogen. The
interaction of uPA with its receptor uPAR is also important
for cell migration.
The uPAR gene (Gene ID: 5329; http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/gene) encodes a single polypeptide chain of
313 aminoacid residues that after the maturation generates
a 55-60kDa protein [21, 22].The uPA/uPAR interaction
on the cell surface induces conformational changes that
facilitate the formation of a new complex with integrins
and with several ECM proteins such as vitronectin [23,
24]. uPAR overexpression can also enhance growth factor
activation and cell migration through the regulation of
several pathways independent from its capacity of binding
uPA and promoting plasmin activation [25].
The uPA/uPAR complex expression plays a
significant role on the invasive and metastatic potential of
HNSCC [22, 26-28] (Figure 2). An active uPA increases
the production of plasmin from plasminogen and this lead
to ECM degradation, which in turn facilitates the invasion

in turn, reduce the conversion of plasminogen to the active
protease plasmin [21]. The SERPINE1 gene is located at
7q21.2-q22 and codifies for a single-chain glycoprotein
of about 50kDa. SERPINE1 has several polymorphisms
in the promoter region that are associated with gene
transcription [43]. Its expression could also be modulated
by several transcription factors such as SP1, AP1, SMAD
proteins, TGF-β1, and p53 [44-46]. SERPINE1 expression
could be epigenetically modulated [47, 48] and it has been

The SERPINE1 gene (Gene ID: 5054, http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) encodes a clade E member of the
serine protease inhibitor (SERPIN) superfamily that is
the main regulator of the plasminogen activator system
(PAs). SERPINE1 inhibits the urokinase-type plasminogen
(uPA) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), which

described as a target for the miR-145 [49-51]. SERPINE1
expression is also related to the activation of hypoxiarelated factors such as HIF-1[52]. The different protein
conformations displayed by SERPINE1 are one of the
particular features of this protein. Its active conformation
inhibits tPA and uPA forming a complex with each
enzyme, whereas its latent form does not react with
their target proteinases [53]. A non-inhibitory substrate
form of SERPINE1 that could be cleaved by PAs has
also been described [54]. After the interaction between
SERPINE1 and PAs, SERPINE1 is cleaved and acquires
an inactive form. This is relevant because, depending on
its conformation, SERPINE1 could interact with different
proteins and activate distinct molecular pathways.
SERPINE1 is the main inhibitor of the uPA/uPAR
complex, which induces its internalization through a
process mediated by the lipoprotein receptor protein-1
(LRP1 receptor) [55]. Based on the pro-metastatic role
of plasmin that promotes cell matrix degradation and cell
migration, SERPINE1 expression would be expected to
develop a protective effect against tumor dissemination
throughout the inhibition of uPA/uPAR complex activity.
However, most of the studies conducted to date, in
several cancer types, indicate that SERPINE1 expression
is associated with poor outcome and increased risk of
metastasis [56]. This supports a multifunctional role
for SERPINE1 that promotes tumor cell migration and
metastasis through several pathways independent from
PAs effectors. In this regard, SERPINE1 has more ligands
than PAs, including ECM components, heparin and
LRP1[57].
In normal and transformed human keratinocytes,
SERPINE1 is up-regulated in response to EGFR and
TGF-β and is associated with an increase in cell migration
and invasion [58-60]. During the process of wound
healing, TGF-β induces the expression of SERPINE1
in leading edge keratinocytes, which stimulates cell
migration and re-epithelization [16].
SERPINE1 expression has also been associated
with tumor cell migration and invasion in head and
neck cancer cells [9, 61, 62]. We showed that the
ectopic overexpression of SERPINE1 enhances head
and neck cancer cell migration, and this is mediated by
the phosphorylation and activation of Akt [62]. These
findings are in agreement with several studies conducted
in endothelial cells, fibrosarcoma and breast cancer cells
indicating that SERPINE1 overexpression increases tumor
cell migration and invasion through the activation of the
PI3K-Akt pathway [63, 64]. SERPINE1 pro-migratory
effect has been associated with LRP1 interaction, which
in turn stimulates the Jak/Stat pathway [65, 66]. In thyroid
cancer cells, LRP1 activates ERK and inhibits JNKdependent pathways, which maintain the invasive capacity
of tumor cells [65]. It would be interesting to evaluate
the interaction of SERPINE1 and LRP1 and whether it
has a similar effect on cell migration in head and neck

cancer cells. Similar results have been observed using “in
vivo” mice models. Bajou K et al. observed a decrease in
local invasion and tumor vascularization of transplanted
malignant keratinocytes in mice deficient in SERPINE1
expression. [67]. Invasion was restored by transfection
with a vector expressing SERPINE1. SERPINE1 may also
contribute to tumor aggressiveness by promoting tumor
angiogenesis [67, 68]. A reduction in tumor vascularity
was also observed in tumors derived from fibrosarcoma
cell implantation in mice lacking SERPINE1 expression
[69].
The studies addressing the connection between
SERPINE1 expression and cell proliferation have
generated inconsistent results. Some groups showed
that SERPINE1 expression increases cell proliferation,
whereas others reported a reduction in cell proliferation
[57, 70]. In head and neck cancer cells, we observed that
the ectopic overexpression of SERPINE1 reduces cell
proliferation, whereas its inhibition with shRNA increases
cell proliferation [62].
In conclusion, in addition to being the main
inhibitor of the PA system, SERPINE1 plays a key role in
promoting migration, spread and angiogenesis of tumor
cells. This pro-metastatic activity of SERPINE1 is most
likely achieved by the activation of multiple signaling
pathways independent of PA system inhibition, which may
explain the apparent paradox between its function as a PA
inhibitor and its association with poor clinical outcome.

UPA/UPAR AND SERPINE1 IN APOPTOSIS
REGULATION AND TUMOR RESISTANCE
Recent findings have suggested that in addition to its
role in cell dissemination and metastasis, the expression
of several components of the PA system could reduce the
cytotoxic effect of anticancer drugs [71]. For instance,
the uPAR expression has been associated with multidrug resistance in small cell lung cancer cells [72]. uPA,
uPAR, and SERPINE1 have also been associated with the
efficacy of tamoxifen treatment in breast cancer [73, 74]. A
high expression of these proteins increases drug resistance.
In head and neck and oesophageal cancer cells,
uPA and SERPINE1 expression are upregulated after
irradiation or reactive oxygen species exposure [75-79].
The activation of SERPINE1 is also associated with
radiation resistance [80]. Moreover, the inhibition of
uPAR has been associated with the downregulation of the
multidrug resistance gene MDR1 [36]. Hypoxia is another
factor that could contribute to tumor resistance. In this
regard, the expression of SERPINE1 has been associated
with the activation of hypoxia-related factors in head and
neck cancer cells [52].
The plasminogen activator system proteins have
been also associated with resistance to targeted therapies
[71]. uPAR expression is associated with the development
of resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy in glioblastoma

[81]. In head and neck cancer cells, the combination of
uPAR down-regulation and EGFR inhibition showed
a synergistic anti-tumor effect [82, 83]. Moreover, an
association between the activation of EGFR signaling and
SERPINE1 expression has also been described [60].
SERPINE1 (PAI-1) increases cisplatin resistance
of head and neck tumor cells [62], while SERPINB2
(PAI-2) increases sensitivity [84]. Interestingly, both PA
inhibitors showed an opposite effect on drug resistance.
These findings and the fact that uPA/uPAR associates with
resistance to therapy, suggest that the effect of SERPINE1
on tumor progression and drug resistance may be due
to the activation of several signaling pathways that are
independent from the inhibition of PA.
In the context of antitumor drug resistance,
SERPINE1 is particularly interesting as it can enhance
tumor progression through the inhibition of the apoptotic
signaling. Thus, SERPINE1 over-expression has an antiapoptotic effect [15, 59, 85, 86] that is mainly associated
with the inhibition of Fas/Fas-L mediated apoptosis [68,
87]. SERPINE1 expression can also promote cell survival
and block apoptosis by inhibiting caspase-3 activation [86].
Accordingly, we showed that the ectopic overexpression
of SERPINE1 protects head and neck cancer cells from
the apoptotic induction after cisplatin treatment [62]. This
effect was mediated by PI3K-Akt pathway activation [62].
Similar findings have been reported in fibrosarcoma in
which the expression of SERPINE1 protects cells from
apoptosis through activation of the PI3K-Akt cell survival
pathway [69, 88, 89].
On the basis of the foregoing, it may be concluded
that SERPINE1 has an important role in protecting cells
from apoptosis induction after the exposure to antitumor
agents, and this should be considered when developing
new treatment strategies, since it may be involved in
cancer recurrence after therapy.

The results reported to date suggest that
SERPINE1 expression could increase cell migration and
simultaneously reduce cell proliferation [62, 90]. In this
regard, SERPINE1 could act as a switch between tumor
cell proliferation and tumor cell migration [16, 90, 91].
This phenomenon commonly known as “go or growth”
supports the notion that changes in tumor cell morphology
associated with an increase in cell motility and migration,
such us the cytoskeletal reorganization, are incompatible
with enhanced cell proliferation [92]. Thus, tumor cells
could activate the migration process to spread to other
locations and once these cells reach a specific tissue,
they could activate cell proliferation in order to colonize
the tissue and generate metastasis. Cell migration is
also accompanied by a reduction in apoptotic signaling
that protects cells from death during their travel towards
the target tissue. We observed that SERPINE1 inhibits
apoptosis while reducing tumor cell proliferation, findings
that are consistent with SERPINE1 enhancement of the
invasive and migratory phenotype [62].
SERPINE1 is directly connected with the epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) and the acquisition of
stemness, two biological processes that are essential
to control the transition from the proliferative to the
invasive tumor phenotype [60, 93-97]. The EMT process
is associated with the activation of the TGF-β pathway
which also induces SERPINE1 activation [98]. In fact,
SERPINE1 has been commonly used as a surrogate
marker of EMT. EMT increases the plasticity of tumor
cells and their capacity to spread to other tissues and it is
closely linked to the acquisition of stem cell properties.
In this sense, SERPINE1 overexpression has been
observed in circulating tumor cells from breast cancer
patients showing EMT-like features [97]. In head and
neck tumors, Lee and colleagues showed that, SERPINE1
inhibition suppresses the self-renewal capacity of cancer
57356

Oncotarget

stem cells through the inhibition of SOX2 [80]. The
overexpression of SOX2, one of the main regulators of
self-renewal in adult tissues, has also been associated
with the development of different types of squamous cell
carcinomas such as lung, esophagus and nasopharyngeal
carcinomas [8, 99].
Recently, Yu et al. have shown a link between
SERPINE1 expression and Notch signaling in
differentiated thyroid cancer [100]. These authors showed
that NOTCH1 induction downregulates SERPINE1
expression and it is associated with a reduction in lung
metastasis development in mice. It would be interesting to
explore if this effect is also present in HNSCC, as a high
percentage of inactivating mutations in Notch has been
observed in this tumor type [101, 102]. Notch signaling
is a crucial regulator of stem cell renewal and promotes
terminal differentiation of keratinocytes through the
expression of p21 and caspase-3 [103-105].
In HNSCCs, the induction of EMT and the
acquisition of cancer stem cell properties may partly
account for the acquisition of resistance to antitumor
agents after the PA system activation [80]. Changes in
cell adhesion and cytoskeletal remodeling, experienced
during the EMT-process, increase tumor cell plasticity

and drug resistance, effects that correlate with an increase
in the expression of uPAR and SERPINE1 [106, 107]. A
mesenchymal-like phenotype showing stemness features
has been observed in the most aggressive subtype of head
and neck tumors that often overexpress SERPINE1 [108111]. uPAR and uPA signaling could also contribute to
cancer stemness, as it has been demonstrated in breast
and pancreatic cancer cells [112, 113]. The high level of
recurrence that occurs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma after
chemoradiotherapy treatment [6] appears to be associated
with the expression of EMT and cancer stem cell markers
[8].
In summary, there is evidence in the literature
supporting a role for SERPINE1 expression in the
induction of EMT and the acquisition of stem cell
properties, two key mechanisms for the generation
of cancer stem cells, which are the transition from a
proliferative to an invasive tumor phenotype and the
development of antitumor resistance associated with late
tumor recurrences.

SERPINE1, UPA AND UPAR EXPRESSION
AS PROGNOSTIC MARKERS IN HEAD
AND NECK CANCER

However, the association between SERPINE1
expression and the clinicopathological characteristics has
generated conflicting results. Some studies have shown
that the SERPINE1 expression is higher in advanced
stages [124, 127]. SERPINE1 expression has been also
associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis
and the perineural invasion [62, 118, 132]. Dhanda et
al showed that SERPINE1 expression was higher in the
invasive front and could predict the extracapsular spread in
patients with oral cancer [61]. Once again, these findings
support the association of SERPINE1 overexpression with
an invasive and migratory tumor phenotype. Other authors
did not find any association between the clinicopatological
characteristics and SERPINE1 expression, probably due to
the small sample size included in these studies [27, 129].
HNSCC studies showed that the expression of uPA
and uPAR is also commonly higher in tumor tissue than
in normal tissue [114, 115, 117, 119, 127, 133-137]. We
also found similar results by analyzing the expression data
(RNA seq level 3 data) of HNSCC samples included in
TCGA project (Figure 3 A) Tobacco smoke could induce
the expression of uPA which is commonly overexpressed
in premalignant and malignant lesions in the oral
cavity [138]. Several studies showed that uPA or uPAR
expression is associated with higher T stage, low grade of
differentiation and the presence of lymph node metastasis
[27, 117, 134, 139]. Most analyses conducted in head and
neck cancer have concluded that the expression of uPA
and uPAR is also associated with a poor clinical outcome
[128, 140, 141] (Table 1).
SERPINB2, another component of the plasminogen
activator system, has been also analyzed in patients with
head and neck cancer, being associated with clinical
outcome [84, 142]. In contrast to SERPINE1, SERPINB2
was identified as a favorable prognostic marker. Moreover,
SERPINB2 down-regulation was associated with a
reduced overall survival in patients with HNSCC. The
opposite effect on patient prognosis of both plasminogen
inhibitors (SERPINE1 and SERPINB2) supports again the
notion that SERPINE1 activates signaling pathways that
are independent from its role as PA system inhibitors.
Taken together, the reported findings suggest that a
high expression of the PA system components, especially
of uPA and SERPINE1, is associated with a poor clinical
outcome in patients with head and neck cancer. In this
regard, our analysis of the gene expression profile of
297 tumors included in TCGA database with a minimum
follow-up of 18 months, identified a subgroup of patients
with a poor survival characterized by a high expression
of uPA and SERPINE1 (Figure 3B). We observed that
the expression of these proteins in pre-treatment tumor
biopsies could be used to identify patients with a high
probability of death and to distinguish them from patients
with low risk. Many studies in breast cancer patients,
have establish SERPINE1 and uPA as suitable markers
for therapy decision-making in patients with early lymph-

SERPINE1 expression is higher in head and neck
cancer tissue than in normal mucosa [27, 48, 62, 114-119].
Although a recent publication shows that SERPINE1 is
up-regulated in cancer-associated fibroblasts and promotes
the invasion of oral squamous cell carcinomas [120],
immunohistochemical studies showed that the expression
pattern of SERPINE1 in HNSCCs often differs from that
observed in other cancer types. In head and neck tumors,
SERPINE1 is expressed mainly in cancer cells, whereas
in breast and colon cancers SERPINE1 is predominantly
expressed in stromal cells rather than in cancer cells [116].
We observed, in this regard, that head and neck cancer
cells showed membrane and cytoplasmatic positivity
for SERPINE1 while tumor-adjacent normal tissue and
stromal tissue areas were negative or showed negligible
staining [62]. This could be particularly important as
SERPINE1 could activate different biological pathways
to promote tumor spread based on whether it is expressed
in tumor cells or stromal cells.
In microarray gene expression studies, SERPINE1
expression has been identified as a HNSCC marker
[109, 111, 121-123]. We used RNA seq level 3 data of
520 head and neck tumor samples and 44 normal tissue
samples included in The Cancer Genome Atlas Database
(TCGA) (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/) to study changes
in uPA, uPAR and SERPINE1 expression after malignant
transformation and its capacity to predict patient survival.
We found overexpression of SERPINE1 in tumor tissue
as compared to normal tissue (Figure 3A). Strojan et
al showed that SERPINE1 expression was also higher
in serum from patients with head and neck cancer than
in healthy controls [124]. Lindberg et al showed that
SERPINE1 expression was absent in normal, hyperplastic
and dysplastic epithelia whereas a high SERPINE1
expression was present in incipient carcinoma and invasive
carcinoma [116]. Additional large independent studies are
needed to establish if the overexpression of SERPINE1
is also present in human papillomavirus (HPV) positive
HNSCCs, a tumor subtype that differs in origin, biological
features and clinical behavior from HPV negative tumors
[125, 126].
A high expression of SERPINE1 in head and neck
tumor biopsies has been associated with a poor clinical
outcome [27, 61, 62, 116-118, 124, 127-131] (Table
1). Most of the studies conducted to date in HNSCC
have concluded that patients with tumors showing a
high SERPINE1 expression had a poorer disease-free
or overall survival than patients with tumors expressing
low levels. Besides its prognostic value, we also showed,
by analyzing three independent cohorts of patients with
HNSCC, that a high SERPINE1 expression increases the
risk of metastasis after treatment [62].

node negative breast cancer [143-146]. We expect that
these markers will be increasingly studied in the near
future to establish if they could also be used in HNSCC
patients for helping treatment decision making, especially
to identify those patients with a high risk of metastasis
who could be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy or
chemo-radiation.

dissemination, promotes angiogenesis, protects cells
from Fas/Fas-L mediated apoptosis and is associated with
poor prognosis. The fact that the overexpression of uPA/
uPAR and its main inhibitor SERPINE1, produce similar
effects on cell migration, tumor spread and prognosis
may seem contradictory, but several reports suggest that
SERPINE1 activates signaling pathways independent of
the inhibition of the uPA/uPAR complex. Both, uPA/uPAR
and SERPINE1 are closely associated with the induction
of EMT and the acquisition of cancer stem cell properties,
which could contribute to resistance to therapy.
uPA/uPAR and SERPINE1 may be useful as
prognostic biomarkers, since they are commonly
overexpressed in HNSCCs and are associated with
a poor clinical outcome. The determination of these
markers in pre-treatment tumor biopsies could be used
to stratify patients according to their risk of metastasis
development. In the future, these markers, especially
uPA and SERPINE1, could be used for treatment
decision making to identify patients with a high risk of
metastasis development, who could benefit from adjuvant
chemotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy. However, they
should be validated in independent clinical trials in order
to clarify their clinical value and to identify suitable
parameters for their detection and patient stratification.
We also expect in the future that the specific inhibitors
of uPA/uPAR and SERPINE1, already in clinical trials,
could be tested in HNSCCs in combination with other
drugs or radiation in an attempt to improve current
antitumor therapy. The inhibition of the PA system could
be particularly relevant to reduce lymph node recurrences
and metastatic dissemination, one of the major challenges
to prevent deaths for head and neck cancer.

INHIBITION OF THE PLASMINOGEN
ACTIVATOR COMPONENTS AS A
THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY IN HNSCC
The reported results point out that the components
of the PA system uPA, uPAR and SERPINE1 could be
good targets for HNSCC therapy, so that their inhibition
could represent a relevant strategy to increase the
efficacy of current antitumor agents. In this sense, the
antitumor activity of several small molecules inhibitors
of SERPINE1, initially developed as antithrombotic
agents, is currently being evaluated [87, 147-150]. These
specific inhibitors usually block the interaction between
SERPINE1 and uPA and generate conformational changes
that result in the irreversible conversion of SERPINE1 into
its latent or cleaved forms [15, 147, 151-153].
In vitro and in vivo xenografts models have shown
an effect for these inhibitors on angiogenesis, apoptosis
induction and tumor growth [87, 154-158]. In pre-clinical
models, Tiplaxtinin, one of the most studied SERPINE1
inhibitors, is able to block the growth and induce apoptosis
in bladder carcinoma, fibrosarcoma and head and neck
cancer cells [80, 87, 156]. However, additional preclinical
studies and subsequent clinical trials are necessary to show
if these specific inhibitors could be used as a targeted
therapy in HNSCCs patients whose tumors overexpress
SERPINE1. Inhibitors of uPAR or uPA are also being
developed and tested as antitumor agents in patients with
breast, pancreatic and head and neck cancer in phase I-II
trials [46, 159-162].
Moreover, as the activation of the PI3K-Akt
pathway was commonly associated with SERPINE1
overexpression, the use of new inhibitors of PI3K-Akt
pathway, currently under clinical investigation, could also
be considered as an option to treat tumors overexpressing
SERPINE1.

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

REFERENCES

In summary, the overexpression of uPA/uPAR
enhances tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion
and plays a key role in metastasis development, conferring
poor prognosis. This system appears to act mainly by
activation of plasmin, involved in ECM degradation, and
through the activation of several signaling pathways such
as the PI3K-Akt pathway. SERPINE1 overexpression
also enhances tumor cell migration and metastasis
