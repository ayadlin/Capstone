Abstract
Follicular lymphoma, the most common indolent subtype of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is associated with a relatively long
overall survival rate ranging from 6 to 10 years from the time of
diagnosis. However, in 20% to 60% of follicular lymphoma
patients, transformation to aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) reduces median survival to only 1.2 years. The
speciﬁc functional and genetic determinants of follicular lymphoma transformation remain elusive, and genomic alterations
underlying disease advancement have only been identiﬁed for a
subset of cases. Therefore, to identify candidate drivers of follicular lymphoma transformation, we performed systematic analysis of a B-cell–speciﬁc regulatory model exhibiting follicular
lymphoma transformation signatures using the Master Regulator

Inference algorithm (MARINa). This analysis revealed FOXM1,
TFDP1, ATF5, HMGA1, and NFYB to be candidate master regulators (MR) contributing to disease progression. Accordingly,
validation was achieved through synthetic lethality assays in
which RNAi-mediated silencing of MRs individually or in combination reduced the viability of (14;18)-positive DLBCL
(t-DLBCL) cells. Furthermore, speciﬁc combinations of smallmolecule compounds targeting synergistic MR pairs induced loss
of viability in t-DLBCL cells. Collectively, our ﬁndings indicate that
MR analysis is a valuable method for identifying bona ﬁde contributors to follicular lymphoma transformation and may therefore guide the selection of compounds to be used in combinatorial
treatment strategies. Cancer Res; 76(3); 664–74. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

lymphomas, predominantly DLBCL, an event representing the
hallmark of aggressive disease and poor prognosis. The frequency
of histologic transformation in patients initially diagnosed with
follicular lymphoma ranges from 20% to 60% depending on
clinical and pathologic criteria, with median survival dropping to
1.2 years following transformation (5).
The molecular events leading to follicular lymphoma transformation are poorly characterized. Although, several genomic
alterations have been associated with follicular lymphoma transformation, including TP53 mutation, MYC rearrangement, REL
ampliﬁcation, and CDKN2A/CDKN2B deletion (6), these represent approximately 23% of all transformed follicular lymphoma
cases (7). In addition to genetic alterations (8–10), epigenetic
mechanisms (11) and microenvironment signals (12) have also
been implicated in follicular lymphoma transformation, contributing to a relatively large, heterogeneous, and poorly understood
molecular landscape.
Our recent elucidation of master regulators (MR) of glioma,
prostate cancer, and germinal center reaction (13–15) suggests
that distinct molecular events may induce aberrant activation of a
relatively small number of MR genes, representing the causal,
functional drivers of established follicular lymphoma transformation signature (16). Thus, to identify such candidate functional
drivers of follicular lymphoma transformation, we interrogated
an established human B-cell regulatory network, assembled from
a large collection of normal and tumor-related gene expression
proﬁles (GEP) using the ARACNe algorithm (17). This approach
has been highly successful in discovering novel mechanisms of
tumorigenesis and tumor progression, including synergistic
gene–gene interactions that could not be elucidated by more
conventional analytic approaches (13–15, 18).

Follicular lymphoma is the second most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) subtype, right after diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL), comprising about 22% of the annually
diagnosed cases (1). Follicular lymphoma is generally diagnosed
in elderly patients (>60 years of age) and is a slow-progressing
neoplasm, with a median survival rate of 10 years. Despite an
overall indolent course and some improvement in overall survival
by rituximab-based therapy (2), follicular lymphoma remains an
incurable disease. The canonical t(14;18)(q32;q21) chromosomal translocation represents the most frequent genetic alteration of
this disease, detected in the vast majority of these tumors, leading
to aberrant expression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 (3).
However, this alteration alone is insufﬁcient for tumor initiation,
as the translocation is also found in healthy individuals (4). Over
time, follicular lymphoma transforms to more aggressive B-cell

Master Regulators of Follicular Lymphoma Transformation

The analysis identiﬁed novel candidate follicular lymphoma
transformation MRs that were experimentally validated, including synthetic-lethal pairs, whose RNAi-mediated cosilencing collapsed the follicular lymphoma transformation signature and
induced signiﬁcant viability reduction. FDA-approved drugs computationally predicted as B-cell–speciﬁc inhibitors of these MRs
were shown to induce t-DLBCL cell death, both individually and
in combination.
The proposed drug prioritization methodology is highly general, relying only on the availability of a cell-speciﬁc regulatory
model and disease-relevant small-molecule signatures. This paves
the road to a more efﬁcient precision medicine pipeline for the
simultaneous and systematic prioritization of small-molecule
compounds for either single-agent or combination therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, antibodies, and reagents
CB33, SUDHL4, and SUDHL6 cells provided by R. Dalla-Favera
(Columbia University, New York, NY) were maintained in
Iscove's Modiﬁed Dulbecco Medium (Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% FBS (Gemini) and antibiotics. The HF1 follicular cell line provided by R. Levy (Stanford University, Stanford,
CA) was maintained in DMEM (Life Technologies), supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. Cells were tested negative for
mycoplasma. Cells were not further authenticated. Antibodies:
rabbit anti-MYC (XP; Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit antiFOXM1 and mouse anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology);
rabbit anti-HMGA1, anti-ATF5, anti-NFYB, and mouse antiTFDP1 (Abcam). Alprostadil, clemastine, cytarabine, and troglitazone (Tocris) and econazole nitrate and promazine hydrochloride (Sigma) were reconstituted in DMSO (Sigma).
Gene silencing, qRT-PCR, and microarray assays
Gene silencing was performed using smart-pool siRNA (Dharmacon) delivered by 96-well Shuttle nucleoporation system
(Amaxa) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Lonza).
Detailed information on nucleoporation, qRT-PCR, and microarray assays is included in Supplementary Methods. All microarray data have been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus
(www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo; accession number GSE66714).
Cell viability
Cell viability was evaluated by PrestoBlue staining according to
the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Fluorescence was
measured using VICTOR 3V Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer). Smallmolecule screening was performed using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) in the Columbia HTS
Facility. Cells were plated in 384-well plates, 24 hours prior to
treatment with serial dilutions of the single compounds. Cell
viability was analyzed at 48 hours to assess compound toxicity
(Supplementary Fig. S4).

Tissue microarray analysis
Tissue microarray analysis (TMA) construction, diagnostic
staining for GCB-origin markers, FISH analysis for t(14;18), and
immunohistochemical staining for MRs were done in the Department of Pathology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
(New York, NY) according to ref. 19.
Computational and statistical methods
Classiﬁcation of patient samples and cell lines by MYC activity. GEP
patient samples were obtained from Dataset 1 (16) and Dataset 2
(20). Samples were classiﬁed as "low" and "high MYC activity" by
clustering methods using MYC targets obtained from ref. 16. An
outlier in the cluster analysis was excluded from further analysis.
To classify cell lines for experimental validation by MYC activity,
we performed clustering analysis using MYC targets on 61 samples
from ref. 21. This dataset contained 38 follicular lymphoma
samples, 13 transformed DLBCL samples (selected on the basis
of BCL2 translocation), 10 normal GCB, 3 DLBCL cell lines
(SUDHL4, SUDHL6, and VAL), and LCL-CB33.
Master Regulator Inference algorithm. We conducted MR analysis
independently for "high activity MYC" and "low activity MYC" for
Dataset 1 (16) and Dataset 2 (20) samples. Dataset 1 contains 6
paired samples in each group, whereas Dataset 2 has 5 and
7 paired samples in "high activity MYC" and "low activity MYC,"
respectively.
Computation of similarity between drug treatment and siRNA
signatures. We used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA; ref. 22)
to assess drug signature similarity, based on enrichment of the 200
most upregulated genes and 200 most repressed genes from
signature A in the other signature B, and vice versa. Enrichment
scores were averaged to obtain a single metric and associated
similarity P value.
Fisher exact test. Fisher exact test was used to assess MR overlap
from each dataset (Table 1), independently for "high" and "low"
MYC activity samples and to test whether speciﬁc MR proteins
have positive/negative expression in DLBCL versus follicular
lymphoma TMAs (Table 2).

Results
Inference of MRs of follicular lymphoma transformation
To infer candidate MRs of follicular lymphoma ! DLBCL
transformation (henceforth follicular lymphoma transformation),
we used the Master Regulator Inference algorithm (MARINa;
refs. 13–15). MARINa assessed the relevance of a transcriptional
factor as a candidate MR of follicular lymphoma transformation
by evaluating whether its transcriptional targets are highly enriched
in genes differentially expressed in patient samples following
transformation. Indeed, if aberrant activity of a transcriptional
factor was responsible for transformation, then its activated and

repressed targets should be overexpressed and underexpressed
following transformation, respectively (Fig. 1). Prior data from
glioma (13) and prostate cancer (14) studies show that top
candidate MRs are highly enriched in genes eliciting essentiality
or synthetic lethality. In addition, RNAi-mediated silencing of MRs
should at least partially revert the follicular lymphoma transformation signature (13, 14).
As a regulatory model in this study, we used an ARACNeinferred interactome for human B cells (21). Follicular lymphoma
transformation signatures were deﬁned using patient-matched
GEPs from 12 patient biopsies at follicular lymphoma diagnosis
and following transformation (Dataset 1; ref. 16). As reported,
patient signatures were stratiﬁed into two distinct molecular
subtypes, representing high and low MYC activity, respectively

(16). Thus, we performed independent MR analysis for each
subtype (Fig. 2A and B; Supplementary Table S1A and S1B).
Results were compared with equivalent MARINa analysis of an
independent dataset (Dataset 2; ref. 20), comprising 12 additional patient-matched biopsies before and after transformation
(Supplementary Table S1C and S1D). Despite only marginal
signiﬁcance (10% overlap in differentially expressed genes,
P  0.05), which is generally the case when the same phenotype
is proﬁled by different laboratories using different technologies
(13, 23), MRs inferred from these datasets were almost perfectly
overlapping (77% identical MRs in the top 13, P ¼ 0.01 by Fisher
exact test), for both the high and the low MYC activity groups
(Table 1). This is consistent with previous reports on the algorithm; see refs. 13 and 23 for details.

regulatory function and abrogate the
follicular lymphoma–transformed
signature.

Activated MRs are functional drivers of the follicular lymphoma
transformation signature
MARINa identiﬁed both activated and repressed candidate MRs
of follicular lymphoma transformation (Fig. 2; Supplementary
Table S1A and S1B). To experimentally validate these results, we
concentrated on the high MYC activity subtype, including 13
activated (FOXM1, MYC, ENO1, TFDP1, NFE2L2, E2F3, NFYB,
CREM, MAZ, NR1H3, ATF5, HMGA1, CEBPG) and 5 repressed
MRs (SP3, JUN, BPTF, RBL2, KLF12; Supplementary Table S1A).
We selected two t(14;18)—positive DLBCL cell lines, SUDHL6
(24) and SUDHL4 (henceforth t-DLBCL cells; ref. 25), representing germinal center B-cell type (GCB) tumors, harboring the
canonical BCL2 translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21), the follicular
lymphoma–derived cell line HF1 (26), and as a control an

immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line LCL-CB33 (27). There are
no conﬁrmed cell lines representative of transformed follicular
lymphoma. As a result, we used the t(14;18)–positive DLBCL cell
lines as the model that best recapitulates the aberrant activity of
the MRs we have identiﬁed from the analysis of transformed
follicular lymphoma in patients. SUDHL6 and SUDHL4 cells
clustered with high MYC activity follicular lymphoma–transformed patients (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). mRNA
expression levels of activated MRs were evaluated by qRT-PCR
in all B-lymphoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Two
genes, NF1H3 and CREM, were excluded from the study due to
insufﬁcient mRNA expression and availability of Dharmacon
library siRNAs, respectively. Activated MRs were systematically
silenced by nucleoporation with the targeting siRNA pool in

SUDHL6 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). These express high levels
of MYC protein and overall highest levels of activated MR mRNA,
among all tested DLBCL cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2A). As
expected, individual MR silencing, conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR,
signiﬁcantly affected the expression of several other MARINainferred MRs, (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Table S2), suggesting
cooperative activity, as a regulatory module, and supporting
their inference as functional drivers of follicular lymphoma
transformation.
Speciﬁcally, individual silencing of activated MR inhibited and
activated expression of several other activated and repressed MRs,
respectively, consistent with their inference as positive regulators
of follicular lymphoma transformation signature. To select dominant activated MR genes, representing the most upstream regulators in the follicular lymphoma transformation control module, we ranked them based on their overall effect on other
MARINa-inferred MRs, based on qRT-PCR data (Supplementary
Table S2B). Following each MR silencing, gene expression of all
other MRs was log-transformed and discretized into three states: H
(fold-change, FC > 0.5), L (FC < 0.5), and M for the others.
Silenced MRs were ranked by average effect on all other MRs, using
their discretized state. The ﬁve highest ranking MRs (FOXM1,
TFDP1, ATF5, HMGA1, and NFYB) were selected for further study
(henceforth, selected MRs).
Differential MR protein expression is conﬁrmed in patient
TMAs
To assess MR protein levels in patients, we compared TMAs
from patients diagnosed with DLBCL against those with follicular lymphoma, by immunostaining with speciﬁc antibodies
(Supplementary Fig. S3A). TMAs were evaluated by a boardcertiﬁed pathologist and scored using a two-tier scale: negative
<5% and positive 5% positive cells. Staining patterns were
analyzed in two complementary ways. First, we compared
DLBCL samples identiﬁed by common diagnostic markers used
to identify GCB-like tumors (BCL2þ, CD10þ, BCL6þ, MUM)
to follicular lymphoma samples (Fig. 3A). The analysis revealed
that HMGA1, FOXM1, and ATF5 were statistically signiﬁcantly
overexpressed in GCB-DLBCL versus follicular lymphoma
patients, whereas TFDP1 and NFYB were not signiﬁcant (Table
2). Next, we compared only DLBCL patients with the canonical
t(14:18) translocation, as detected by FISH, to follicular lymphoma patients (Fig. 3B) to identify those more likely to
represent follicular lymphoma transformation. These results
conﬁrmed that all selected MRs, including NFYB and TFDP1,
had higher protein expression in follicular lymphoma–transformed patients, although the difference for FOXM1 was not
statistically signiﬁcant. These results were consistent with
protein expression data from the follicular lymphoma cell line
HF1 compared with high MYC t-DLBCL cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2B), suggesting that overexpression of the selected
MRs in follicular lymphoma–transformed patients is associated
with the process of transformation and that TFDP1 and NFYB
are uniquely overexpressed following follicular lymphoma
transformation.
Activated MRs are synergistic drivers of DLBCL cell
proliferation
A hallmark of follicular lymphoma transformation is an
increase in cellular proliferation, which usually correlates with
higher MYC expression and activity (20). To evaluate an involve-

ment of the selected MRs in cell proliferation in vitro, we assessed
viability following their siRNA-pool–mediated silencing in
SUDHL6, SUDHL4, HF1, and CB33 cell lines. As conﬁrmed by
Western blot analysis and qRT-PCR, signiﬁcant mRNA and protein level reductions were observed at 20 hours (Supplementary
Fig. S2C and S2D).
MARINa-inferred MRs frequently participate in synergistic
regulation, consistent with their activity within a common
regulatory module (13, 14). As a result, we also performed
siRNA-mediated cosilencing of all 10 possible selected MRpairs (Fig. 4A). siRNA targeting Ubiquitin B or AllStars Cell
Death Control siRNA were used as positive controls. Results
were normalized to control scrambled siRNA (NT). Conﬁrming
previous studies (13–15), while individual MR silencing
(except for ATF5) did not signiﬁcantly reduce cell viability at
24 hours, in either DLBCL cell line, MR cosilencing profoundly
affected cell viability for most MR pairs, (7/10) in SUDHL6 and
(10/10) in SUDHL4, supporting their role as candidate synergistic dependencies of t-DLBCL cells. In contrast, there was only
minimal effect in control cells, (2/10) in HF1 cells and 0/10 in
CB33 cells. This suggests that follicular lymphoma transformation results from and is dependent on the cooperative effect of
multiple dysregulated transcriptional factors and not from
aberrant activity of any individual one in isolation.

Gene expression analysis of t-DLBCL cells following MR
silencing
To further validate the role of inferred MRs in follicular lymphoma transformation, we analyzed the gene expression signature of t-DLBCL cells following both individual MR and MR-pair
silencing. Speciﬁcally, if some of the MARINa-inferred MRs are
bona ﬁde causal determinants of follicular lymphoma transformation, their silencing should at least partially abrogate the
follicular lymphoma transformation signature, with a more profound effect when MR pairs are cosilenced. To test our hypothesis,
we selected the ﬁve MR pairs producing the most signiﬁcant
synergistic cell viability reduction in both t-DLBCL cell lines,
including HMGA1/TFDP1, HMGA1/ATF5, HMGA1/FOXM1,
ATF5/TFDP1, and NFYB/FOXM1, and performed GEPs of
SUDHL6 cells at 20 hours following silencing of each MR and
MR pair (Fig. 4B and C) (Supplementary Methods). Differential
gene expression analysis, with respect to NT control SUDHL6
cells, was performed using a SAM test (28). We used GSEA analysis
to assess whether genes differentially expressed following MR
silencing were negatively enriched in genes differentially
expressed in patients following follicular lymphoma transformation in the high-MYC subtype, using both independent
studies (Fig. 4B and C; refs. 16, 20). We also compared normalized enrichment score (NES) for individual MR silencing
versus MR-pair silencing, to further evaluate the synergistic

www.aacrjournals.org

nature of MR regulation. Analysis of patient signatures from
both datasets (16, 20) consistently identiﬁed 2 pairs (HMGA1/
TFDP1 and ATF5/TFDP1) as effecting the most striking reversal
of t-DLBCL cell gene expression to a follicular lymphoma–like
state. For both pairs, cosilencing signiﬁcantly outperformed
individual MR silencing, both by NES and/or P value assessment. In addition, the HMGA1/FOXM1 pair was identiﬁed and
experimentally validated as a candidate synergistic based on
signatures from Dataset 2 (20). Taken together, these assays
show that most MARINa-inferred MRs indeed regulate genes in
the follicular lymphoma transformation signature, even
though, individually, their effect is not sufﬁcient to induce
follicular lymphoma transformation signature collapse.
Indeed, genes differentially expressed following individual MR
silencing, including HMGA1, TFDP1, and ATF5, were signiﬁcantly enriched in genes expressed in follicular lymphoma
patients before transformation. In sharp contrast, consistent
with previous results in other tumors, MR-pair silencing leads
to follicular lymphoma transformation signature collapse and
signiﬁcant loss of cell viability at 24 hours.

therapeutic opportunities (18). As proof of concept, we thus
proceeded to assess whether B-cell–speciﬁc inhibitors of validated
MRs could be systematically identiﬁed from small-molecule
perturbation assays. Following the Connectivity Map rationale
(29), we reasoned that the differential expression signature following MR silencing in human B cells represent an ideal multiplexed gene reporter assays to assess the activity of candidate
small-molecule inhibitors of the same MR. As transcriptional
factor targets are highly conserved across 18 distinct subtypes
of human B cells, including follicular lymphoma and DLBCL
(the rationale for using the B-cell interactome for this analysis;
ref. 30), we proceeded to assess 92 compounds for which GEPs
were available following perturbation of an ABC (OCI-LY3)
and a GCG (OCI-LY7) DLBCL cell lines (31). Speciﬁcally, we
assessed enrichment of compound-induced signatures in genes
differentially expressed following siRNA-mediated silencing of
validated follicular lymphoma transformation MRs in SUDHL6
cells, using a two-tail GSEA (23) to account for both overexpressed and underexpressed genes, to identify compounds

that signiﬁcantly recapitulate relevant MR silencing (Supplementary Table S3A).
As individual MR silencing had little effect on tumor viability,
we prioritized four compound combinations predicted to target
the synergistic MR pairs inducing greatest viability reduction in
SUDHL6 and SUDHL4 cells. These were tested in SUDHL4 and
SUDHL6 (t-DLBCL), HF1 (follicular lymphoma), and LCL-CB33
(normal control) cells (Supplementary Table S3B). For each
combination, we used a 10  10 dilution matrix, with individual
compound concentrations ranging from 0.003 mmol/L to 20
mmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S4). Cell viability was assessed by
ATP levels at 48 hours following compound treatment (see
Materials and Methods). To evaluate compound synergy, we used
the Excess-over-Bliss (EOB) score (Supplementary Methods),
deﬁned as a difference between the observed and predicted
additive drug combination effect (Fig. 5; Supplementary Table
S5). Compound pairs were considered strongly synergistic at EOB
 20. As expected, compound pairs predicted to target synergistic
MRs were strongly synergistic in t-DLBCL cells but not in follicular

lymphoma and control cells. Among these, alprostadil/cytarabine
(targeting the HMGA1/FOXM1 pair) were strongly synergistic in
both t-DLBCL cell lines. Troglitazone/cytarabine (targeting the
FOXM1/NFYB pair) and econazole/promazine (targeting the
HMGA1/TFDP1 pair) presented stronger synergistic activity in
SUDHL4 versus SUDHL6 cells and vice versa, respectively, consistent with greater viability reduction following cosilencing of the
associated MR pairs. Finally, clemastine/cytarabine (both targeting FOXM1), showed no synergistic activity in any of the four cell
lines, as expected.
Although the clinical relevance of these results is limited by the
relatively small number of proﬁled compounds and by lack of in
vivo validation, all of the four predicted compound combinations
induced synergistic t-DLBCL cell death. Thus, these results represent an important proof of concept that MR analysis, combined
with straightforward perturbational assays, can help identify
compound combinations that are effective in abrogating tumor
cell viability in vitro.

Discussion
Precision cancer medicine has been almost universally predicated on the use of targeted inhibitors for oncogenes harboring activating mutations, based on the "oncogene addiction"
paradigm (32). Although this has been transformational for
some tumors, from chronic myelogenous leukemia to lung
cancer, it also presents signiﬁcant limitations. Indeed, oncogene mutations are neither individually sufﬁcient nor necessary for implementing and maintaining molecularly distinct
tumor subtypes. Consistently, there are no fully penetrant
genomic alterations responsible for inducing follicular lymphoma transformation of every high or low MYC subtype
patient, even though the gene expression signatures of patients
undergoing follicular lymphoma transformation to either subtype are virtually identical, suggesting a common, conserved
functional regulators set.
As a result, we decided to approach follicular lymphoma
transformation from a different and highly complementary perspective. Rather than looking for recurrent genetic or epigenetic
alterations in a transformed patient cohort, we interrogated a
B-cell–speciﬁc regulatory network to identify transcriptional factors that are responsible for the speciﬁc regulation of genes that are
differentially expressed following patient follicular lymphoma
transformation to either the low MYC or high MYC subtype. As
previously shown for glioma, breast cancer, and even Alzheimer
disease, and as conﬁrmed by DIGGIT analysis (18), the MRs of
follicular lymphoma transformation were downstream of most
previously reported genetic alterations, including CARD11,
CD79A, CD79B, STAT3, CREBBP, TNFRSF14, SOCS1, BCL10,
PRKCB, and PLCG2 (data not shown) (10). As a result, they
represent nononcogene dependencies, as proposed in ref. 33,
whose aberrant regulatory activity is the result of one or more
genetic or epigenetic alterations in their upstream pathways.
Even though the MARINa algorithm has already been effectively used to elucidate novel functional drivers in glioblastoma,
prostate cancer, leukemia, and breast cancer, our study presents
signiﬁcant novelty in two distinct areas. First, we report a novel
tumor checkpoint, comprising 18 MR proteins, whose synergistic
activity regulates the genes that are differentially expressed in
follicular lymphoma patients following transformation. Coinhibition of activated MR pairs induces rapid and speciﬁc cell death

www.aacrjournals.org

in t-DLBCL cells, but not in follicular lymphoma related and
normal related B cells. Second, we used the MR-silencing signature
to elucidate compounds that, in combinations, may induce
t-DLBCL–speciﬁc cell death, opening a new avenue in precision
cancer medicine, especially for phenotypes lacking a canonical
targetable oncogene dependency.
Critically, both the B-cell–speciﬁc regulatory model and the
follicular lymphoma transformation signatures were derived
from primary patient tissue. Thus, our predictions are independent of potentially idiosyncratic cell line or mouse model dependencies and should have high likelihood of being further recapitulated in vivo. Our model for the transformation process is
consistent with the recently proposed linear evolution model (9),
suggesting that transformed follicular lymphoma originates from
the dominant follicular lymphoma clone as a result of new
oncogenic events. However, as MARINa analysis is agnostic to
the underlying tumor progression mechanism and only predicts
the regulatory proteins that become aberrantly activated as a result
of these secondary events our ﬁndings would equally support
alternative hypotheses, such as divergent evolution.
Conﬁrming results from previous studies (13, 14, 18), MARINa-inferred MRs were found to be highly enriched in synthetic
lethal pairs. Although several of these genes were previously
reported as overexpressed in hematologic malignancies, such as
MYC (34), FOXM1 (35), TFDP1 (36), and ATF5 (37), the majority
of inferred MRs were not previously causally associated with
follicular lymphoma transformation nor were they shown to
represent individual/synergistic dependencies of transformed
DLBCL. Five of these MRs emerged as the strongest causal determinant of follicular lymphoma transformation signature, including FOXM1, TFDP1, ATF5, HMGA1, MYC, and NFYB. Interestingly, with the exception of MYC, these genes had been previously
reported among 26 MRs of the germinal center reaction (15),
suggesting that dysregulation of proteins presiding over B-cell
maturation programs by a complex landscape of genetic and
epigenetic alterations may be responsible for transformation of
GCB-originated follicular lymphoma to DLBCL. Immunohistochemical assays in patient-derived TMAs conﬁrmed overexpression of the ﬁve MR proteins in DLBCL patients harboring the
canonical t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation, compared with follicular lymphoma tumors.
We showed that MRs act synergistically to preserve the transformed follicular lymphoma state. Indeed, siRNA-mediated cosilencing of MR pairs, including HMGA1/TFDP1 and ATF5/TFDP1,
and FOXM1/HMGA1, had a profound effect on t-DLBCL cell
viability but not on that of follicular lymphoma and lymphoblastoid cell lines. Consistently, analysis of GEPs from SUDHL6
cells following cosilencing of these MR pairs showed a signiﬁcant
shift toward a follicular lymphoma–like signature. Slight differences in the analyses were likely associated with the differences in
Lymphochip cDNA gene sets used in these analyses (10,731 and
4,908 genes, respectively).
HMGA1/TFDP1 and ATF5/TFDP1 pairs were consistently
identiﬁed from both patient signatures. HMGA1 proteins are
members of a nonhistone, chromatin-binding protein family,
detected at high level during the process of embryogenesis in
contrast to normal adult tissues and associated with a variety of
aggressive human malignancies (reviewed in ref. 38). A recent
study of HMGA1's role in reprograming somatic cell into
pluripotent stem cell (39) suggests that HMGA1 could be an
important MR of neoplastic transformations, responsible for

tumor state plasticity and reprogramming. Yet, our study
represents the ﬁrst evidence where HMGA1 is identiﬁed as a
mechanistic regulator of follicular lymphoma transformation
and as a potentially synergistic cofactor. TFDP1 is an established heterodimerization partner of E2F family proteins, regulating transcriptional activity of cell-cycle progression genes
(40). Both TFDP1 and E2F1 can interact and inhibit transcriptional activity of p53 and are expressed in NHLs (36). A
member of the E2F family, E2F3, was also inferred as an
activated MR by MARINa analysis, suggesting that these proteins may represent interacting partners in follicular lymphoma
progression. Finally, ATF5 is a member of the ATF/CREB family
of transcriptional factors, widely expressed in neoplastic and
normal tissues; however, only in neoplastic cells was silencing
of ATF5 shown to induce cell death (41). ATF5 was also
associated with sensitivity to bortezomib-induced apoptosis
in SUDHL6, but not SUDHL4 DLBCL cell lines (37), nonetheless it was never reported in the context of follicular lymphoma
transformation.
Precise characterization of MR genes representing individual/
synergistic oncogene and nononcogene dependencies of transformed DLBCL opens a range of novel opportunities for targeted
pharmacologic treatment. Here we demonstrate that relevant MR
inhibitors, likely operating indirectly, could be effectively inferred
from the analysis of GEPs following small-molecule perturbation
in representative cell lines.
Speciﬁcally, based on our previously ascertained conservation
of regulatory interactions across 18 distinct human B-cell subtypes, including follicular lymphoma and DLBCL, we used GEPs
of DLBCL cell lines following treatment with a library of 92 FDAapproved compounds to infer novel candidate inhibitors of
follicular lymphoma transformation MRs. Our analysis identiﬁed
several compound combinations that were experimentally validated, showing synergistic activity in t-DLBCL cells but not in
normal or follicular lymphoma–derived cells. Remarkably, even
though this study represents only a proof of concept, it prioritized
cytarabine, a drug frequently used in combination therapy for the
treatment of acute leukemias and lymphomas (42, 43). Indeed,
high-dose cytarabine, in combination with cisplatin and dexamethasone (DHAP), etoposide, cisplatin, and methylprednisolone (ESHAP), is representative of key chemotherapeutic regimens for NHL and Hodgkin lymphoma treatment (43). Our study
identiﬁed the novel synergistic interaction of cytarabine and
alprostadil (Prostaglandin E1) or troglitazone to induce cell death
in DLBCL cells but not in follicular lymphoma and control cells.
Prostaglandins are hormone-like lipid metabolites, playing a key
role in inﬂammatory response (44). Although prostaglandins are
associated with wide range of cancers they were also shown to
induce apoptosis in human leukemia cell lines (45). Troglitazone
is an anti-inﬂammatory drug, initially used for treatment of
patients with type 2 diabetes. It activates PPARs and decreases
NF-kB (46). As PPARg agonists were shown to induce apoptosis in
human B lymphomas (47), troglitazone could prove a very
realistic choice in transformed follicular lymphoma. Because of
adverse events, this drug was withdrawn from the market in 2000.
Yet, new troglitazone derivatives with lower toxicity and anti-

proliferative activity are now emerging (48). Two other compounds, econazole nitrate and promazine hydrochloride, showed
synergy in the SUDHL6 cell line. Econazole is best known as an
antifungal medication but there is increasing evidence that it may
also have anticancer properties (49). Moreover, it was shown that
sensitivity to econazole is speciﬁcally mediated by MYC in the
HL60 cell line. Indeed, MYC-negative cells were resistant to this
agent (50).
Taken together, these data suggest that the systematic, networkbased identiﬁcation of MR genes may represent an alternative and
highly complementary approach to the targeting of classic oncogene dependencies. Once these dependencies are identiﬁed, their
small-molecule inhibitors, including both individual drugs and
synergistic drug combinations, can be effectively prioritized. If
further validated, such an approach would signiﬁcantly extend the
reach of precision cancer medicine, especially as the analyses
performed in this article can be performed in hours to days using
high-performance computing platforms. This would allow the
efﬁcient prioritization of compound and compound combinations to treat individual tumors.
