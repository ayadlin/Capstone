BACKGROUND: Despite the impact of proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents, infusional chemotherapy regimens continue to be used for patients with multiple myeloma. To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, contemporary data regarding salvage chemotherapy
regimens are sparse, with no direct comparisons. METHODS: The authors performed a single-institution study comparing 3 salvage
chemotherapy regimens in 107 patients with recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma: dexamethasone, cyclophosphamide, etoposide,
and cisplatin (DCEP) in 52 patients; bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone, cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (VTD-PACE) in 22 patients; and cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (CVAD) in 33 patients.
RESULTS: Differences between treatment groups existed, including higher baseline creatinine for patients treated with CVAD
(P<.001) and greater prior use of infusional chemotherapy for those receiving VTD-PACE (P<.001). There was no significant difference
in response noted among the 3 regimens: 55% overall (P 5 .18). For the intent-to-transplant population, a similar percentage
were successfully bridged to transplant without further therapy (62%; P 5 .9). There was no difference in survival observed across the
3 regimens, with an overall median progression-free survival of 4.5 months (95% confidence interval, 3.6-5.5 months [P 5 .8]) and a
median overall survival of 8.5 months (95% confidence interval, 6.1-11 months [P 5 .8]). Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference noted among clinically relevant adverse events, although there was a suggestion of fewer adverse events with DCEP.
Patients treated with the intent to transplant had superior outcomes for response (odds ratio, 3.40; P 5 .01), progression-free survival
(hazard ratio, 0.28; P<.001), and overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.19; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The 3 salvage regimens demonstrated
similar responses, survival, and adverse events. Given the short response durations observed in the recurrent/refractory disease setting, infusional chemotherapy is best suited for cytoreduction before more definitive therapy is administered. Cancer 2015;121:3622C 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Treatment advances in multiple myeloma have significantly improved patient outcomes.1 In the era of proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib), immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide and lenalidomide), and autologous stem cell transplantation,
the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma is approaching 50%, with even
greater survival outcomes reported among recent clinical trials.2-5 In addition, carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and panobinostat have demonstrated benefit among patients with recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma after at least 2 prior therapies.6-8 Despite these improvements, multiple myeloma remains incurable and the majority of patients will develop
refractoriness to proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents. As such, traditional infusional chemotherapy continues to play a role in the treatment of patients with recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma, especially as a bridge to highdose therapy and stem cell transplant or as a means of rapid tumor debulking.
Intensive chemotherapy regimens were initially developed to improve responses and overcome chemotherapy resistance in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma.9-11 One of the earlier regimens, CVAD, combines hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide with conventional vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone. Initial reports
described an overall response rate (ORR) of 40% and a median OS of 15 months in a population with refractory multiple

myeloma.9 Another such regimen, DCEP, uses dexamethasone with continuous-infusion cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin. In a population of patients with
recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma, this combination
demonstrated an ORR of 58% and a median response duration of 9 months.10 In an effort to further improve depth
of response, investigators at the University of Arkansas
incorporated thalidomide with oral dexamethasone and 4
days of continuous-infusion cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (DT-PACE), achieving a
complete response (CR) rate of 16% among a population
of previously treated patients.11 These agents are frequently
combined with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib as
part of the Total Therapy 3 induction regimen, VTDPACE.12
Although these salvage therapies continue to be
widely used, to the best of our knowledge they have never
been compared directly. As such, consensus guidelines do
not specify a preferred salvage chemotherapy regimen for
patients with multiple myeloma.13 In addition, these regimens have primarily been studied in the era before the
availability of proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents and therefore their efficacy after treatment
with newer agents is less clear. A few select retrospective
analyses have described outcomes from the modern era,
but to our knowledge these reports have only analyzed
individual regimens.14-17 A comparison of regimen activity could potentially help to guide treatment decisions.
Furthermore, these agents are associated with significant
toxicity, and the identification of an equally efficacious
yet less toxic regimen would also be important for clinical
decision-making.
In the current study, we conducted a single-center
retrospective analysis of patients with recurrent/refractory

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients with a diagnosis of recurrent/refractory multiple
myeloma who received 1 of the 3 salvage chemotherapy regimens (DCEP, VTD-PACE, or CVAD) between January
2005 and December 2013 were identified. Recurrent or refractory disease was defined by disease progression after at
least 1 prior regimen. The dosage and schedule of the individual agents are listed in Table 1. The decision to choose a
particular infusional regimen was made at the discretion of
the treating physician. For some patients, thalidomide was
added to the DCEP regimen, and such instances were categorized under the parent regimen. Furthermore, either bortezomib or thalidomide was occasionally omitted from
VTD-PACE due to preexisting neuropathy. Prespecified
clinical variables were abstracted from patient records,
including age, sex, race, prior therapies, Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, cytogenetics/fluorescence in situ hybridization, baseline creatinine,
baseline neutrophil and platelet counts, and baseline transfusion requirements. Prior lines of therapy were demarcated
by episodes of disease recurrence or progression, and a single
line of therapy may have included induction, transplant,
and maintenance. Refractoriness to individual agents was
defined as disease progression during or within 60 days of
the last treatment. High-risk cytogenetics were defined by
the presence of a t(4;14) or the deletion of 17p. The International Myeloma Working Group criteria were used to assess
best response.18 Intent to transplant was based on the assessment of the treating physician, and generally included an
evaluation of age, organ function, comorbid conditions,
and progression-free survival (PFS) from prior transplant.

Predefined clinically relevant adverse events included
new transfusion requirement, prolonged hospitalization,
treatment delay, unplanned rehospitalization for an adverse
event, dose reduction due to an adverse event, neutropenic
fever, venous thromboembolism, and treatment-related
mortality. New transfusion requirements were noted for
patients not previously dependent on red blood cell or platelet transfusions. Prolonged hospitalizations beyond that
expected for chemotherapy administration were noted if
related to treatment complications. A significant delay in
treatment was defined as >7 days. Treatment-related mortality was defined as a death without evidence of disease
progression within 30 days of last treatment.
Statistical Analysis

The primary endpoint for this study was the ORR,
defined as a partial response or better. Secondary end3624

points included CR rate, very good partial response
(VGPR) or better, rates of successful bridge to transplant
for the intent-to-transplant population (without additional regimens), PFS, OS, and rates of clinically relevant
adverse events. Patient and disease-specific characteristics were compared using chi-square analysis for discrete
variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum test for means of
continuous variables, both with the exact method using
Monte Carlo estimation. PFS was calculated from the
time of treatment to the time of disease progression or
death. OS was calculated from the time of treatment to
the time of death. If no disease progression or death
occurred, patients were censored at the time of last
follow-up. The median PFS and OS were estimated
using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences
between groups were compared using the log-rank test.
Response outcomes were compared using logistic

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

We identified 107 patients who received 1 of the 3 regimens
for recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma (52 treated with
DCEP, 22 treated with VTD-PACE, and 33 treated with
CVAD). Four patients who received DCEP were treated
with the addition of thalidomide. Of the patients treated
with VTD-PACE, 2 were treated without thalidomide
(VD-PACE) and 3 were treated without bortezomib
(DT-PACE). Patient characteristics are listed in Table 2.
The median age for the entire population was 56 years
(range, 29-73 years), and the majority of patients were men
(67%). Prior treatment history was similar between the 3
groups, with a median number of 3 prior lines of therapy
and a median time from initial diagnosis of 2.8 years. Prior
therapies included lenalidomide (78%), bortezomib (91%),
thalidomide (35%), carfilzomib (10%), and pomalidomide
(9%). Prior chemotherapy-based regimens were documented in 53% of patients, including VAD (16 patients),
cyclophosphamide (7 patients), oral melphalan (3 patients),
and liposomal doxorubicin-based regimens (12 patients).
The majority of patients had demonstrated refractoriness to
bortezomib (77%) and lenalidomide (66%), with 53% of
patients found to be refractory to both. In addition, 6
patients treated with VTD-PACE had already received at
least 1 of the 3 salvage regimens (2 received prior DCEP,
1 received prior VTD-PACE, 2 received prior CVAD, and
1 patient received all 3 regimens). One patient who was

0.15-0.83) and the time from initial diagnosis (OR, 0.84;
95% CI, 0.71-0.98) were found to be significantly associated with overall response (Table 4). In addition, patients
treated with the goal of bridging to transplant were found
to have superior rates of response (OR, 3.4; 95% CI,
1.39-8.32). There was no significant response correlation
for patients with extramedullary disease (P 5 1.0), the
presence of circulating plasma cells (P 5 .2), or high-risk
cytogenetics (P 5 .3). On multivariate analysis, intent to
transplant was found to be the only significant predictor
of response (OR, 3.55; 95% CI, 1.41-8.96) (Table 5).
Progression-Free Survival

The median PFS for the entire group was 4.5 months
(95% CI, 2.98-5.46 months), with no significant difference observed between treatment regimens (Fig. 1). By
regimen, the median PFS was 3.8 months (95% CI, 2.834.87 months) for DCEP versus 4.5 months (95% CI,
2.30-8.09 months) for VTD-PACE versus 5.8 months
(95% CI, 2.37-11.47 months) for CVAD (P 5 .8). On
univariate analysis (Table 4), high-risk cytogenetics (hazard ratio [HR], 2.04; 95% CI, 1.24-3.34), white race
(HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.99), and intent to transplant
(HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.18-0.44) were found to be significantly correlated with PFS. Among the population for
whom transplant was planned, a successful transplant was
associated with a superior PFS (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.140.45). The median PFS for those patients successfully
bridged to autologous stem cell transplant was 13.1
months (95% CI, 10.48-15.71 months).

DISCUSSION
Overall, responses were similar among the 3 salvage regimens (DCEP, VTD-PACE, and CVAD). In addition,
secondary outcomes, including PFS, OS, successful bridge
to transplant, and adverse events, were not statistically different. Although the majority of patients exhibited disease
response to therapy, response durations and survival times
were short. These outcomes highlight the inherently poor
prognosis of patients with multirecurrent and/or refractory multiple myeloma. The average patient in this analysis received salvage infusional chemotherapy after at least
3 prior regimens, and the majority were refractory to both
lenalidomide and bortezomib. It is interesting to note that
there was no correlation noted between refractoriness to
proteasome inhibitors or immunomodulatory agents and
response to infusional chemotherapy. For this analysis, we
chose to focus on prespecified adverse events that were
believed to be clinically relevant to patient outcomes.
Rates of adverse events were high across all regimens, with
greater than one-third of patients requiring unplanned
rehospitalization, mostly for neutropenic fever. The relatively small numbers of patients in this analysis limited
the statistical significance of toxicity differences between
treatment groups, but there was a suggestion of increased
febrile neutropenia among the patients treated with
VTD-PACE and higher rates of prolonged hospital stays
among those treated with CVAD.
The response and survival outcomes in the current
analysis are comparable to 2 other published retrospective
analyses from the modern era. Park et al reported outcomes on 59 patients from South Korea who were treated
with salvage DCEP for recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma.15 The average patient treatment history in their
3628

analysis was similar to the current study population, with
a median of 3 prior regimens (98% received prior bortezomib and 81% received prior lenalidomide) and a median
time from diagnosis of nearly 35 months. The reported
ORR was 45%, and the median PFS and OS were 3.7
months and 8.0 months, respectively. It is interesting to
note that the treatment-related mortality in their study
was high (14.8%), and was mostly related to febrile neutropenia and attributed to the low rates of growth factor
administration in that country. Gerrie et al reported an
analysis of DT-PACE, describing the outcomes of 75
patients treated after a median of 3 prior regimens and a
median of 20 months from the initial diagnosis.14 The
authors reported an ORR of 49%, with a median PFS of
5.5 months and a median OS of 14 months. The superior
survival times in comparison with those reported in the
current study appear to be mostly attributable to a greater
percentage of patients subsequently receiving autologous
stem cell transplantation, which highlights the importance of using salvage chemotherapy as a bridge to more
definitive treatments. In addition, few patients in the analysis by Gerrie et al had previously received proteasome
inhibitors or immunomodulatory agents (32% receiving
bortezomib and 23% receiving lenalidomide).14 The
greater prevalence of prior lenalidomide and bortezomib
treatment in the current study is likely more representative
of heavily pretreated patients in the modern era.
Prior analyses of salvage infusional chemotherapy
have focused on individual regimens. Comparisons across
these different retrospective studies are difficult due to discrepancies in practice patterns between institutions, as
highlighted by differences in growth factor administration
and use of transplantation. We believe the current singleinstitution analysis is unique in that it compares 3 commonly used salvage infusional regimens from the era of
proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents.
Although no significant differences in outcomes were

observed among these poor-risk patents, a few interesting
and potentially useful observations can be made. The
more intensive regimen, VTD-PACE, did not provide
superior response or survival. It should be noted that
patients treated with VTD-PACE in the current study were
more likely to have received a prior salvage infusional regimen. As such, it is possible that responses to VTD-PACE
could be higher with earlier use. Furthermore, there
appeared to be less toxicity among the patients treated with
DCEP. It is important to note that patients treated with
the goal of bridging to transplant appeared to benefit the
most from salvage infusional chemotherapy, whereas those
for whom a transplant was not planned experienced very
short survivals. The concept of using intent to transplant as
a prognostic factor was a difficult variable to objectively
qualify in the current retrospective analysis. In general,
multiple factors were taken into account, including patient
age, ECOG performance status, comorbidities, end-organ
function, and psychosocial issues. In addition, for previously transplanted patients, prior response duration was
typically considered. However, as a real-world analysis of
clinical practice, we believe that patients for whom a transplant is not planned are less likely to benefit from salvage
infusional chemotherapy, given the short survival times
and significant toxicities.
The current study was limited by its retrospective
nature, which makes it difficult to control for potential
treatment biases. Overall, the greater percentage of
patients treated with DCEP noted herein likely reflects an
institutional preference for this regimen, possibly related
to individual perceptions of efficacy and tolerability.
There were a disproportionate number of patients with
elevated creatinine in the group treated with CVAD,
because the cisplatin-containing regimens are typically
avoided in such patients. As an independent variable, creatinine did not significantly correlate with either response
or survival on univariate analysis. In addition, there were
more patients with extramedullary disease among the
groups treated with DCEP and VTD-PACE. This variable was significantly correlated with inferior OS on both
univariate and multivariate analyses. The lack of a survival
difference between treatment groups may suggest the
ability of cisplatin-containing regimens to overcome the
negative prognostic impact of extramedullary disease.
However, the small number of patients and retrospective
nature of the current study do not allow for definitive conclusions. Moreover, it is unlikely that a randomized trial
comparing these regimens will be performed and retrospective studies will likely serve as the best available evidence for the clinical use of these regimens.

New therapeutic agents, including oral proteasome
inhibitors (ixazomib and oprozomib), monoclonal antibodies (elotuzumab, daratumumab, and SAR650984), and
other novel agents (such as selinexor), may soon alter the
therapeutic landscape for patients with recurrent/refractory
myeloma.19-25 In general, patients with recurrent/refractory
disease would likely best be served by enrollment in welldesigned clinical trials. However, many patients either will
not qualify for clinical trials due to restrictive eligibility criteria or do not have time to wait for enrollment due to rapidly
progressive disease. For such patients, traditional multiagent
infusional chemotherapy regimens remain a viable option,
particularly as a bridge to more definitive therapy such as
transplant. Overall, the results of the current study demonstrated similar clinical outcomes with all 3 salvage regimens.
Our experience favors the DCEP regimen based on the possibility of less toxicity; however, patient comorbidities such
as renal failure must be considered.
The results of the current study revealed no statistically significant differences in outcomes among patients
with recurrent/refractory multiple myeloma who were
treated with 1 of the 3 salvage chemotherapy regimens:
DCEP, VTD-PACE, and CVAD. It is interesting to note
that the more intensive regimen, VTD-PACE, did not
demonstrate superior disease response or survival. There
was a suggestion of fewer adverse events in the patients
treated with DCEP. Given the significant toxicities and
short durations of disease control, salvage infusional
chemotherapy should be reserved as a bridge to more definitive treatment, such as transplant or clinical trials.
