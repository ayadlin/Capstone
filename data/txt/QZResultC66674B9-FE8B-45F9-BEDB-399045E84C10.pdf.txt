Abstract
Despite progress in the management of breast cancer, the
molecular underpinnings of clinically aggressive subtypes of
the disease are not well-understood. Here, we show that
activation of Notch developmental signaling in estrogen
receptor (ER)–negative breast cancer cells results in direct
transcriptional up-regulation of the apoptosis inhibitor and
cell cycle regulator survivin. This response is associated
with increased expression of survivin at mitosis, enhanced
cell proliferation, and heightened viability at cell division.
Conversely, targeting Notch signaling with a peptidyl
;-secretase inhibitor suppressed survivin levels, induced
apoptosis, abolished colony formation in soft agar, and
inhibited localized and metastatic tumor growth in mice,
without organ or systemic toxicity. In contrast, ER+ breast
cancer cells, or various normal cell types, were insensitive to
Notch stimulation. Therefore, ER breast cancer cells become
dependent on Notch-survivin signaling for their maintenance,
in vivo. Therapeutic targeting of this pathway may be explored
for individualized treatment of patients with clinically aggressive, ER breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5273–81]

Introduction
Despite the success of ‘‘targeted’’ agents (1), including estrogen
ablation (2), breast cancer remains a potentially deadly disease,
marked by extraordinary molecular and clinical heterogeneity (3).
Gene expression signatures have been useful to catalog the
different molecular subtypes of breast cancer, and in some cases,
this information carries important prognostic (4, 5), and predictive
(6) value to identify patients at risk of recurrent disease (7).
However, the molecular pathways underlying clinically aggressive
variants of breast cancer, typically estrogen receptor (ER)–negative
disease, have not been identified (8), and ‘‘individualized’’ therapy
for these patients based on molecular disease profile is not
presently available.
Developmental signaling pathways, such as Notch, are critical for
tissue specification and organ morphogenesis (9), and are
frequently deregulated in cancer (10). Although it remains to be
seen to what extent these mechanisms are truly disease ‘‘drivers,’’
mutations in Notch-1 (11) cause oncogene expression in a subset
of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (12), and deregulated
Notch activity may influence cellular transformation (13), cell cycle

dynamics (14), progenitor/stem cell maintenance (15), and disease
outcome (16) in breast cancer. Notch signaling initiates with the
binding of extracellular ligands, Jagged-1, Jagged-2 or Delta-1, or
Delta-4 to Notch receptors at the cell surface. In turn, this results in
proteolytic cleavage of Notch intracellular domain (NIC) by the
enzyme g-secretase, nuclear import of NIC, and recruitment of
transcriptional modulators, including RBP-Jn, to drive de novo
expression of target genes (17). Although it is clear that Notch and
other developmental pathways control multiple downstream
networks of cell proliferation, cell survival, and progenitor/stem
cell maintenance (9), only a handful of target genes capable of
orchestrating such pleiotropic responses has been identified, and
their contribution to the cancer phenotype has remained largely
elusive.
As a unique member of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) gene
family (18), survivin has emerged as a pivotal cancer gene with
multiple roles in the regulation of mitosis, suppression of cell
death, and enhanced adaptation to cellular stress (19). The sharp
differential expression of survivin in cancer, as opposed to normal
tissues, is largely controlled at the level of transcription, and
several oncogenic pathways, including developmental signaling by
Wnt/h-catenin (20), have been shown to promote survivin gene
expression. There is also evidence that survivin may be a critical
gene in breast cancer, linked to aggressive disease (6), resistance to
apoptosis (21), and modulation of ErbB2 signaling (22).
In this study, we mapped novel molecular circuitries of breast
cancer pathogenesis. We found that survivin is a novel target of
Notch signaling, and this occurs preferentially in ER breast
cancer cells. Therapeutic targeting of a Notch-survivin axis
produces strong anticancer activity, and is well-tolerated in vivo,
opening new opportunities for ‘‘individualized’’ therapy in clinically
aggressive breast cancer subtypes.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and viral transductions. Breast adenocarcinoma cell lines
MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in
culture as recommended by the supplier. Breast adenocarcinoma cell lines
T47D, Sum149, and HBL100 were generously provided by Dr. Arthur M.
Mercurio (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA).
Primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) were obtained from
Lonza. Primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF), human gingival
fibroblasts (HGF), human epithelial fibroblasts (WS-1), and human
intestinal epithelial cells (INT; all from ATCC) were cultured per
manufacturer’s instructions and used at early passages before the onset
of senescence. A NIC construct has been characterized previously (23). For
adenoviral transduction, various cell types (1  105) were incubated with
replication-defective adenovirus pAd-NIC, pAd-GFP, or pAd-Control at
multiplicity of infection of 50 for 4 to 8 h at 37jC, harvested at increasing
time intervals, and processed for individual experiments.
Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was harvested using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). One microgram of total RNA was

reversed transcribed in the presence of SuperScript II polymerase plus
random primer (Invitrogen). Survivin or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was amplified (28 cycles) and separated
on 1.5% agarose gels. Band intensity normalized to GAPDH expression was
quantified using Labworks 4.6 (UVP BioImaging Systems).
Western blotting and antibodies. Cellular extracts were prepared in a
lysis buffer containing 20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mmol/L NaF,
1 mmol/L Na3VO4, plus protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Lysates
were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon
membranes (Millipore). The antibodies used were as follows: survivin
(1:1,000) from NOVUS Biologicals; XIAP (1:500), green fluorescent protein
(GFP; 1:500), cytochrome c (1:1,000), and Cox-4 (1:5,000) from BD
Biosciences; Bcl-2 (1:500) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; V5 epitope for
detection of NIC or Jagged-1 (1:5,000) from Invitrogen; NIC (1:1,000) from
Rockland; and h-actin (1:5,000) from Sigma.
Analysis of survivin gene expression. A cDNA construct comprising
the first 830 bp of the mouse survivin promoter upstream of the
translational initiation codon fused to GFP (ms-830-GFP) was characterized
previously (24). HeLa cells were cotransfected with ms-830-GFP plus
Notch-1 or Jagged-1 cDNA by Lipofectamine. After 24 h, cells were analyzed
for GFP expression by Western blotting, or fluorescence microscopy with
image acquisition on an Olympus IX71 microscope outfitted with an
Olympus Regina camera. A putative RBP-Jn binding site at position -355 in
ms-830-GFP was mutated using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis
kit with primer: 5¶-GAACCTGCAGAGCACATGttACTTGCAGCGGACATGC-3¶.
The mutant construct (mutant ms-830-GFP) was confirmed by DNA
sequencing, transfected in HeLa cells, and analyzed for GFP expression after
Notch stimulation. For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA),
MDA-MB-231 nuclear extracts were prepared using the CelLytic NuCLEAR
extraction kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA
sequences corresponding to the 355 region of ms-830-GFP (5¶-GGAAGAACCTGCAGAGCACATGGGACTTGCAGCGGACATGCT-3¶), a random
survivin promoter region (5¶-TGCAACGCCAACCTGGGCTGTGTT CGGGGCATGCCCAGCCTG-3¶), or an RBP-Jn binding region in the human Hes
promoter (5¶-GTTACTGTGGGAAAGAAAGTC-3¶) were synthesized. Probes
(3.5 pmol) were made double stranded by annealing at equimolar concentrations, and 5¶ end labeled with 1 AL of [g-32P] ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and
10 U of T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) for 10 min at 37jC. MDA-MB-231
nuclear extracts were incubated with the reaction mixture (10 AL) containing radiolabeled DNA probes, 2 Ag of poly(deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic)
acid (Sigma), 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 50 mmol/L NaCl,
4% glycerol, 0.5 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, 50 Ag bovine serum
albumin, and various unlabeled competing oligonucleotides. After 30 min
of incubation at 22jC, samples were separated by electrophoresis on 4%
nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, and bands were visualized by
autoradiography.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) was performed using the ChIP-IT Express kit (Active Motif) per
the manufacturer’s protocols. MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with pAdNIC before fixation with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. Cells were washed,
lysed, and sonicated to reduce DNA lengths to a range of 300 to 600 bp. The
chromatin/DNA complexes were incubated with antibodies to RNA Pol II
(Active Motif), RBP-Jn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or IgG (Active Motif) for
18 h at 4jC. The immune complexes were precipitated, eluted, reverse
crosslinked, and treated with proteinase K. The resulting DNA samples were
amplified with primers to the RNA Polymerase II site in the GAPDH
promoter ( forward, 5¶-TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG-3¶; reverse, 5¶-TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA-3¶), the 305 bp putative RBP-Jn binding
site in the human survivin promoter ( forward, 5¶-ACCACGCCCAGCTAATTTTTG-3¶; reverse, 5¶-CCTCGACTGCTTTCAAAGAACG-3¶), and the RBP-Jn
binding site in the Hes promoter ( forward, 5¶-CGTGTCTCCTCCTCCCATTG-3¶; reverse, 5¶-CCAGGACCAAGGAGAGAGGT-3¶).
Cell cycle analysis. Cells (1.5  105) were synchronized at the G1-S
transition by treatment with 2 mmol/L thymidine for 18 h at 37jC. In some
experiments, cells were released after 18 h, infected with pAd-NIC or pAdGFP for 8 h, and resynchronized with 1 mmol/L thymidine for another 18 h.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

Aliquots of synchronized cultures were collected at 0, 4, 8, 10, 12, and
14 h after the second thymidine release, and analyzed for DNA content by
propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry, or alternatively, by Western
blotting. For single-color cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol
for 18 h at 20jC, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell cycle populations
were gated and quantified using FlowJo software (TreeStar). A pAd-T34A
survivin dominant-negative mutant was characterized previously (25). In
some experiments, MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with the combinations
pAd-NIC/pAd-Control, pAd-T34A/pAd-Control, or pAd-NIC/pAd-T34A for
24 h; synchronized with 2 mmol/L thymidine for 24 h; and released into
S phase. Cultures were collected after various time intervals and analyzed
for DNA content by propidium iodide staining, or, alternatively, by Western
blotting.
Cell death assays. A g-secretase inhibitor (GSI) z-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO was
purchased from Calbiochem and dissolved in DMSO. In metabolic activity
assays, cells were treated with GSI or DMSO for 24 h, incubated with
50 Ag/mL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) for 2 h, and analyzed at A595. In other experiments, cells treated
with GSI or DMSO were spun onto slides, DNA was stained with 4¶,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and cells with chromatin condensation/
fragmentation were scored by fluorescence microscopy. For experiments of
cytochrome c release, GSI-treated cells were harvested, fractionated into
cytosolic extracts using the ApoAlert Cell Fractionation kit (Clontech), and
analyzed for time-dependent release of cytochrome c by Western blotting.
Caspase activity was determined using the Capase-3/7 In Situ Assay kit
(Millipore) by multiparametric flow cytometry, in the presence or absence
of a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (American Peptides;
20 Amol/L).
Analysis of tumorigenesis. For soft agar colony formation, 1  104 cells
were treated with GSI (0.125–10 Amol/L) for 24 h, suspended in 2 mL of
DMEM/0.35% bactoagar, and plated onto 6-well tissue culture plates
containing 2 mL DMEM/0.75% bactoagar as a bottom layer. After a 2-wk
incubation at 37jC, 5% CO2, colonies were stained with 0.005% crystal violet
and counted under high-power field.
All experiments involving animals were approved by an Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. For xenograft tumor studies, 5  106
MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into each flank of 6- to 8-wk-old female
CB17 severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)/beige mice (Taconic).
When tumors reached 150–175 mm3 in volume, mice were randomized
(3 animals per group, 6 tumors per group, 2 independent experiments) and
treated daily with i.p. injections of 3 mg/kg GSI or vehicle control. For
experiments in vivo, z-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO (American Peptides) was synthesized to >99% purity and dissolved in 25% Cremophor/PBS (Sigma). Mice
were weighed daily, monitored for signs of pain and distress, and tumor
size were measured in three dimensions with a caliper using the equation
L  W2/2 (mm3). All animals were euthanized when tumor volume
exceeded 1,500 mm3. At the end of the experiment, liver, spleen, lung,
kidney, pancreas, and colon were harvested, fixed in formalin, and
embedded in paraffin blocks for histology. For quantification of lung
micrometastases, serial lung sections were cut 20 Am apart, stained with
H&E, and analyzed by light microscopy.
Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed using the unpaired Student’s
t test on a GraphPad software program (Prism 4.0). All statistical tests
were two sided. A P value of 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant.

with this, transduction of ER breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB231, HBL100, and Sum149 cells (26) with pAd-NIC, the active
intracellular domain of Notch, resulted in a 1.5- to 2-fold increased
survivin mRNA expression, compared with pAd-GFP–treated
cultures (Fig. 1A). In contrast, Notch stimulation of ER+ breast
cancer cells MCF-7 and T47D, or normal HMECs, did not modulate
survivin mRNA levels (Fig. 1A). In time course experiments, pAdNIC increased expression of survivin in ER MDA-MB-231 cells,
but not ER+ MCF-7 cells, by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Conversely,
Bcl-2 was comparably up-regulated in both cell types (27), whereas
another survival factor, XIAP, was not significantly affected
(Fig. 1B). Even a prolonged, 72-h stimulation of normal primary
HMECs with pAd-NIC did not modulate survivin or XIAP
expression (Fig. 1C).
Notch regulation of survivin gene expression. To determine whether Notch directly stimulated survivin gene expression, we next used an 830-bp fragment of the survivin promoter
fused to GFP, i.e., ms-830-GFP (24), containing two putative
RBP-Jn sites (17) at 543 and 355 (Fig. 2A). Cotransfection of
Notch-1 or Jagged-1 together with wild-type ms-830-GFP resulted
in strong expression of GFP, by Western blotting (data not
shown), and quantitative fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2B),
compared with pcDNA3-expressing cells (Fig. 2B, top). Mutation
of the proximal RBP-Jn site at 355 in ms-830-GFP (Fig. 2A)
completely abolished Notch-1 induction of GFP to background
levels of control cultures (Fig. 2B, bottom). By EMSA, a radiolabeled probe of the 355 RBP-Jn site formed DNA-protein
complexes in MDA-MB-231 nuclear extracts (Fig. 2C). This
interaction was competed out by equimolar concentrations of
unlabeled probe, or a canonical Hes RBP-Jn sequence but not
by an unrelated competitor (Fig. 2C). Similarly, a radiolabeled
Hes RBP-Jn probe bound to MDA-MB-231 nuclear extracts, in
a reaction also competed out by molar excess of unlabeled
probe (Fig. 2C). In contrast, a probe of the 543 survivin RBP-Jn
site did not form DNA-protein complexes in MDA-MB-231 extracts
(data not shown) and was not further investigated. Consistent
with these data, ChIP experiments using MDA-MB-231 cells
transduced with pAd-NIC revealed that RNA polymerase II and
RBP-Jn were physically associated with the human survivin

promoter in vivo at the putative RBP-Jn binding site at 305
(Fig. 2D).
Notch-1 regulation of cell proliferation. To determine the
kinetics of Notch-1 induction of survivin, we next studied cell
cycle transitions in synchronized MDA-MB-231 cells after transduction with pAd-NIC. In synchronized cultures expressing
pAd-GFP, endogenous survivin was expressed in a cell cycledependent manner, peaking at mitosis, 8- to 12-hours after
thymidine release (Fig. 3A), consistent with previous observations (28). Activation of Notch-1 in these cells up-regulated
survivin with the same kinetics, in a reaction that was also
maximal at mitosis (Fig. 3A). Quantification of cell cycle phases
revealed that GFP-expressing cells approached S phase 4 hours
after thymidine release, entered mitosis after 8 hours, and
completed cell division between 10 and 12 hours, with reaccumulation in the next G1 phase by 14 hours (Fig. 3B). In contrast,
Notch activation resulted in accelerated mitotic transitions, with
30% of NIC-expressing cells exiting mitosis 10 hours after release,
compared with 17% of GFP-transduced cells, and 64% of Notch-1–
stimulated cells re-entering G1 after 14 hours, versus 40% of
control cultures (Fig. 3B). Accelerated mitotic progression in
Notch-stimulated MDA-MB-231 cells was associated with increased cell proliferation over a 6-day interval, compared with
pAd-GFP–expressing cultures (Fig. 3C). In contrast, pAd-NIC or
pAd-GFP did not induce changes in cell proliferation in ER+ MCF-7
cultures (Fig. 3C).
We next asked whether Notch-1 induction of survivin was
important for cell viability during this proliferative response.
For these experiments, we transduced MDA-MB-231 cells with
a dominant-negative survivin mutant (pAd-T34A), which interferes with the mitotic function of survivin (28). Expression of
pAd-T34A had no effect on synchronized, interphase cultures,
but caused acute loss of cell viability as cells progressed through
mitosis (Fig. 3D), in agreement with previous observations
(28). Notch stimulation reversed pAd-T34A–induced cell death
and preserved cell viability at mitosis (Fig. 3D). In control
experiments, pAd-NIC had no effect on MDA-MB-231 cell viability
(Fig. 3D). The higher number of cells with >4N DNA content
after pAd-NIC transduction may reflect mitotic slippage and

mitotic transition.
Effect of Notch targeting on breast cancer cell viability. To
test the effect of Notch signaling in breast cancer, we used a GSI
z-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO, which inhibits receptor cleavage and NIC
generation (17). GSI treatment reduced endogenous survivin levels
in MDA-MB-231 cells, and this was associated with parallel
suppression of Bcl-2 and XIAP (Fig. 4A). In contrast, GSI minimally
affected the expression of these antiapoptotic molecules in MCF-7
cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, GSI had no effect on survivin levels in
WS-1 fibroblasts or INT colonic epithelial cells, whereas XIAP was
modestly reduced, and Bcl-2 was undetectable in these cells
(Fig. 4A). Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with a second,
structurally independent GSI molecule, z-Ile-Leu-CHO, reduced
Notch-1 expression and attenuated survivin levels in MDA-MB-231
cells (data not shown).
Transduction of MDA-MB-231 cells with pAd control or
pAd-NIC did not significantly affect cell viability, as determined
by DEVDase, i.e., caspase, activity and multiparametric flow
cytometry (Fig. 4B, top). GSI treatment of these cells resulted
in a 2-fold increase in the fraction of apoptotic cells, in a reaction nearly completely reversed by pAd-NIC (Fig. 4B, top). In
contrast, GSI did not significantly induce caspase activity in
MCF-7 cultures, and transduction of these cells with pAd-NIC
or pAd-Control had no further effect on cell viability (Fig. 4B,
bottom). Consistent with these data, GSI induced concentration-

dependent killing of multiple ER breast cancer cell types,
including MDA-MB-231, HBL100, Sum149 (Fig. 4C, left) with
IC50 of <3.5 Amol/L. Comparatively, ER+ cell types, MCF-7 and
T47D, were less sensitive to GSI-induced killing, with IC50
concentrations of >10 and 5.907 Amol/L, respectively (Fig. 4C,
middle). In addition, comparable concentrations of GSI did
not affect the viability of three primary fibroblast cell lines,
(WS-1, HFF, and HGF), normal INT epithelial cells, or primary
HMECs (Fig. 4C, right).
GSI induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells. MDA-MB231 cells exposed to GSI exhibited morphologic hallmarks of
apoptosis, including chromatin condensation and fragmentation
(Fig. 5A, left), and concentration-dependent release of cytochrome
c in the cytosol (Fig. 5A, right). GSI-induced cell death under these
conditions was fully reversed by a broad spectrum caspase
inhibitor, zVAD, comparable with its inhibition of staurosporine
(STS)-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B). In contrast, GSI did not affect
cell viability or cytochrome c release in MCF-7 cultures
(Fig. 5A). To test whether loss of survivin after Notch inhibition
contributed to apoptosis, we transduced MDA-MB-231 cells with
pAd-GFP or pAd-Survivin, and quantified GSI-induced cell death.
In GFP-expressing cells, GSI induced a sustained G2-M arrest and
apoptosis (Fig. 5C). Expression of survivin in these cells did not
significantly affect the mitotic arrest imposed by Notch inhibition
but completely reversed GSI-induced cell death, whereas pAd-GFP
was ineffective (Fig. 5C).

Targeting Notch signaling for breast cancer therapy. GSI
treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells abolished colony formation in soft
agar (Fig. 5D, left), whereas comparable concentrations of GSI were
three orders of magnitude less effective in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5D,
right). Next, we grew MDA-MB-231 cells as superficial tumors in
immunocompromised mice and treated the animals with vehicle or
systemic GSI (3 mg/kg/daily i.p.). In control animals, MDA-MB-231
tumors grew at a steady exponential rate over a 2-week time
interval (Fig. 6A). In contrast, GSI treatment significantly inhibited
tumor growth over a comparable time interval (Fig. 6A). In
addition, lungs from mice treated with vehicle exhibited a high
density of epithelial micrometastases (29) by H&E staining of serial
lung sections (Fig. 6B, left). In contrast, GSI treatment inhibited
formation of lung metastases, in vivo (Fig. 6B, right).
Safety of Notch targeting for cancer therapy. Mice in the
GSI group did not exhibit signs of systemic toxicity, and had no
significant weight loss, compared with vehicle-treated animals
(data not shown). Histologic examination of lung, colon, pancreas,
spleen, kidney, and liver was largely indistinguishable in control or
GSI-treated mice (Fig. 6C). Specifically, lung sections from GSI or
control group showed a conserved architecture with a normal
alveolar septum, absence of lymphatic dilation, or interstitial
inflammation (Fig. 6C). With respect to the gastrointestinal tract,
GSI treatment did not cause goblet cell hyperplasia of colonic
epithelium, and resulted in only mild fascitis of pancreatic
tissue, compared with vehicle-treated control (Fig. 6C). The liver
architecture of hepatic nodules was fully preserved in GSI-treated

animals, without steatosis or inflammatory infiltration, and
extramedullary hematopoiesis was comparably observed in control- or GSI-treated animals (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that Notch signaling increases cell
proliferation and promotes resistance to apoptosis preferentially
in ER breast cancer (30), a disease subtype often marked by
aggressive clinical behavior (31). A critical effector of this pathway
was identified as survivin, a pleiotropic regulator of cell
proliferation and inhibitor of apoptosis overexpressed in many
cancers (19). Conversely, inhibition of Notch signaling with a
peptidyl GSI down-regulated survivin, inhibited cell proliferation,
increased apoptosis, and suppressed the growth of localized and
metastatic ER breast cancer in mice, without overt toxicity.
Recently, there has been considerable interest in elucidating
how developmental signaling pathways, including Notch (17),
may aberrantly contribute to tumorigenesis. Mounting evidence
suggests that Notch deregulation may engender critical tumor
hallmarks, including oncogene expression (12, 32), angiogenesis
(33), stem cell maintenance (34), deregulated cell cycle progression (14), and antiapoptotic mechanisms (35). In this context, survivin fits well the pleiotropic requirements of a Notch
effector gene for its essential roles in mitosis (36), preservation
of stem/progenitor cell homeostasis (37), inhibition of apoptosis

stimulation resulted in direct activation of survivin gene
transcription through at least one RPB-Jn site (17) in the survivin
promoter. This is reminiscent of how another developmental
signaling program, i.e., Wnt/h-catenin, directly induces survivin
gene transcription in cancer (20). Consistent with the known tissue
specificity of Notch signaling, which has been variously associated
with malignant transformation (11), or tumor suppression (40),
a Notch-survivin axis was preferentially operative in ER versus
ER+ breast cancer cells, and not at all detected in various normal
cell types.
Three potential mechanisms may be envisioned for a role of
survivin as a Notch target in clinically aggressive breast cancer (31).
First, Notch-induced heightened survivin levels at mitosis may
deregulate multiple mitotic checkpoints (36), and ultimately
contribute to genetic instability and aneuploidy, in vivo. Second,
this pathway may directly promote drug and radiation resistance.
Higher survivin levels have been consistently linked to inhibition of
apoptosis induced by DNA damaging agents (41), as well taxanes
(28), two mainstay therapeutic regimens in breast cancer. Third,

survivin may operate as a Notch-regulated cytoprotective and/or
mitotic factor to promote long-term persistence of breast cancer
‘‘stem cells’’ (42), potentially contributing to ductal carcinoma
in situ (15), an idea consistent with the presence of survivin in
‘‘stemness’’ gene signatures (43), and its role in hematopoietic stem
cell viability (37).
Although the introduction of ‘‘targeted’’ therapies (1), including
antihormonal strategies (2), has significantly improved the survival
of breast cancer patients, the prognosis of metastatic disease
remains grim. This often involves ER subsets of the disease, for
instance triple-negative (ER, progesterone receptor, and HER-2),
basal-like breast cancer, which is characterized by high recurrence
rates (7). Here, the increased sensitivity of ER versus ER+ breast
cancer cells to therapeutic Notch inhibition, in vitro and in
preclinical models, suggests that these cells may become dependent or ‘‘addicted’’ (44) to Notch signaling. Although the
importance of ‘‘oncogene addiction’’ in long-term maintenance of
the neoplastic phenotype, in vivo, is debated, the notable clinical
responses observed in subsets of cancer patients after targeting of

specific cellular pathways support their pivotal role(s) as disease
‘‘drivers’’ (45). A similar paradigm has been proposed for Notch
(46), and GSIs have been pursued as therapy for potential ‘‘Notchaddicted’’ tumors, especially T-cell leukemias (47). Despite its
rationale, this approach has not been without concerns. GSIs
are not entirely specific for Notch, as they also affect other
transmembrane proteins, including E-cadherin, the epidermal
growth factor receptor, and CD44 (48), and global inhibition of
Notch receptors has been associated with serious toxicity,
especially aberrant differentiation of intestinal epithelium, and
T-cell development, in vivo (49). The data presented here suggest a
more encouraging scenario, as a prototype peptidyl GSI was safely

administered systemically to mice with effective anticancer activity
but negligible systemic or organ toxicity. Although this bodes well
for potential further (pre)clinical development of similar compounds, it remains to be seen whether long-term GSI treatment
will eventually result in pharmacologic resistance, as observed in
leukemias (11).
In summary, we have uncovered a novel Notch-survivin signaling
axis, preferentially exploited in ER breast cancer cells. Although
this pathway may contribute to worse clinical outcome, a potential
‘‘addiction’’ of ER breast cancer cells to a Notch-survivin axis may
open new prospects for individualized therapy of these recurrenceprone patients.
