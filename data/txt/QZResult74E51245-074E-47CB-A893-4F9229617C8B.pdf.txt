Abstract
Metallothioneins (MT) are potent scavengers of free radicals that are silenced in primary hepatocellular
carcinomas (HCC) of human and rodent origin. To examine whether loss of MT promotes hepatocarcinogenesis,
male Mt-1 and Mt-2 double knockout (MTKO) and wild-type (WT) mice were exposed to diethylnitrosamine
(DEN) and induction of HCC was monitored at 23 and 33 weeks. The size and number of liver tumors, the ratio
between liver and body weight, and liver damage were markedly elevated in the MTKO mice at both time points
compared with the WT mice. At 23 weeks, MTKO mice developed HCC whereas WT mice developed only
preneoplastic nodules suggesting that loss of MT accelerates hepatocarcinogenesis. MTKO tumors also
exhibited higher superoxide anion levels. Although NF-kB activity increased in the liver nuclear extracts of
both genotypes after DEN exposure, the complex formed in MTKO mice was predominantly p50/65 heterodimer
(transcriptional activator) as opposed to p50 homodimer (transcriptional repressor) in WT mice. Phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276 causing its activation was also significantly augmented in DEN-exposed MTKO livers. NFkB targets that include early growth response genes and proinflammatory cytokines were significantly
upregulated in MTKO mice. Concurrently, there was a remarkable increase (100-fold) in Pai-1 expression;
significant increase in c-Jun, c-Fos, c-Myc, Ets2, and ATF3 expressions; and growth factor signaling that probably
contributed to the increased tumor growth in MTKO mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MTs
protect mice from hepatocarcinogen-induced liver damage and carcinogenesis, underscoring their potential
therapeutic application against hepatocellular cancer. Cancer Res; 70(24); 10265–76. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most prevalent
cancer in the world and the third leading cause of cancerrelated death with a 5% survival rate over 5 years and more
than 500,000 deaths annually (1). HCC develops due to hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections, alcohol abuse, or other
metabolic disorders that lead to liver cirrhosis. The common

denominator in HCC of different etiology is the induction of
oxidative stress by inflammatory cells, resulting in chronic
hepatic injury and cell death, followed by oncogenic transformation of surviving hepatocytes and compensatory proliferation that leads to tumorigenesis (2, 3).
Metallothioneins (MT) are low molecular weight, cysteinerich stress response proteins that are ubiquitously expressed
at low level in eukaryotes and are highly induced by heavy
metals, UV radiation, restraint stress, bacterial and viral
infections, and oxidative stress (4, 5). MTs, coded by 4 different
genes in mammals, are highly homologous and evolutionarily
conserved (6). MT1 and MT2 are ubiquitously expressed,
whereas MT3 and MT4 are specifically expressed in the brain
and squamous epithelium of skin and tongue, respectively
(7, 8). MTs play a critical role in zinc homeostasis and
protection against heavy metals and free radicals (9, 10).
We and others have reported dramatic loss of MT expression in primary human liver cancer whereas the adjacent
normal liver tissue expresses high levels of the protein (11–13).
Our studies have shown that MTs are also suppressed in a
transplanted rat hepatoma model (14) in mouse (15) and rat
cell lines (16) due to promoter CpG island methylation, and
the suppressed gene could be reactivated by treatment with
DNA hypomethylating agents alone or in combination with
histone deacetylase inhibitors (17). The downregulation of

MT expression in human HCC cell lines is because of the
inhibition of GSK3b-mediated phosphorylation of CEBPa by
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (12). It appears that MT initially
undergoes transcriptional repression in primary tumors that
could be epigenetically silenced at later stages of tumor
development. Because excessive free radical formation plays
a causal role in tumorigenesis (18), silencing of MTs in both
rodent and human HCCs suggests their potential role in
predisposing hepatocytes to neoplastic transformation especially after toxic insults. Here, we tested this hypothesis using
Mt-1 and Mt-2 double knockout mice in a diethylnitrosamine
(DEN)-induced hepatocarcinogenesis model. Although MT
knockout (MTKO) mice are viable and reproduce normally,
they are sensitive to heavy metals and free radicals (19). The
data demonstrate that loss of MT function indeed facilitates
hepatocarcinogenesis in MTKO mice by activating several
oncogenes and suppressing proapoptotic genes by differentially modulating hepatic NF-kB activity.

Materials and Methods
Animals and tumor induction
All animal experiments were carried out under protocols
approved by The Ohio State University Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee. 129/SvImJ [wild type
(WT)] and 129S7/SvEvBrd-Mt1tm1Bri Mt2tm1Bri/J (MTKO) male
mice from The Jackson Laboratory were maintained in a
sterile room at 25 C with a 12-hour light–dark cycle and
provided food and water ad libitum. Four-week-old mice
(n ¼ 8) received 1 intraperitoneal injection of DEN (90 mg/kg
body weight) or saline (control) and were provided 0.05%
phenobarbital (PB) in water after 2 weeks until tumors were
harvested at 23 and 33 weeks.
Cell lines
Metallothionein null (MT/) and the WT (MTþ/þ) mouse
fibroblasts were kindly provided by Dr. John Lazo (University
of Pittsburgh) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (1) at 37 C in a 5%
CO2 incubator. The cell lines were authenticated by morphology check and Western blot analysis for MT expression
periodically.
Magnetic resonance imaging
Respiration-gated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) liver
images were obtained using 11.7 T system (Bruker BioSpin).
The animals were anesthetized with 2.0% isoflurane mixed
with carbogen (95% O2/5% CO2) and maintained with 0.7% to
1.5% isoflurane. Axial and coronal T1-weighted images were
collected with the following parameters: fast low angle shot
(FLASH) sequences with respiration gating, repetition time
(TR)/echo time (TE)-151.7/2.8 ms, flip angle 30 degrees,
matrix-192  256 (H  W) pixels, field of view 260 
280 mm2 (tumor) or 240  300 mm2 (control), slice thickness
1 mm2 with no interspaces, acquisition time 12 minutes
(mean) for 18 slices, with average 16 slices. HCCs were
distinguished from normal liver tissue on the basis of differences in homogeneity and signal intensity.

Histology
Liver sections (5-mm thick) from paraffin embedded blocks
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Two independent
pathologists blinded of experimental detail examined the
sections. For assessing superoxide anions, 5-mm sections were
stained with 10 mmol/L dihydroethidine at 37 C for 30 minutes and viewed under fluorescence microscopy (20). Cells
stain red when DHE is oxidized.
RNA isolation and real time RT-PCR
Total RNA from whole liver or macrodissected tumors was
subjected to real time RT-PCR in quadruplicates, using SYBR
Green chemistry. Relative expression was calculated using the
comparative CT method (21). Primer sequences are available
on request.
Microarray analysis
Total liver RNA at 23 weeks or tumor RNA at 33 weeks was
subjected to Cancer Pathway Oligo Array (Qiagen) following
the company's protocol. Briefly, 3.0 mg of total RNA was
reverse transcribed followed by biotinylated cRNA synthesis.
An equal amount of cRNA was hybridized to the membrane.
The chemiluminescent spots were scanned and analyzed
using the Web-based GEArray Expression Analysis Suite provided by SABiosciences.
Antibodies, Western blot analysis,
and immunohistochemistry
Liver extracts were immunoblotted with anti–a-fetoprotein
(AFP), anti-ATF3, anti-Pai-1, anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho(ser276)p65, and anti-tubulin antibodies.
The signal was developed with Amersham ECL (enhanced
chemiluminescence; GE Healthcare). For immunohistochemistry, 4-mm paraffin embedded liver sections were stained with
anti-Ki67 (DAKO) and anti-Pai-1 antibody. The signal was
detected using 3,30 -diaminobenzidine.
Nuclear extract preparation and EMSA
Nuclei isolation, extract preparation from the livers, and
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) were done as
described earlier (22, 23).
Glutathione assay
Liver reduced glutathione (GSH) content was measured
with liver extract made from PBS-washed frozen tissue using
Glutathione Assay kit (Cayman Chemical Company) following
the manufacturer's protocol.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean  SD. Statistical significance
of differences between groups was analyzed by unpaired
Student's t test, and P  0.05 was considered to be statistically significant, and marked *; P  0.01 and P  0.001 were
marked as ** and ***, respectively (Figs. 1–6). All real-time
RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were repeated at least
twice. Representative data from reproducible experiments

MT Deficiency Predisposes Mice to Liver Cancer

Results
Susceptibility of metallothionein knockout mice
to DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis increases
dramatically compared with wild-type mice
To explore the possibility that loss of MT1 and MT2
predisposes animals to hepatocarcinogenesis we selected
the DEN/PB-induced liver tumor model in mouse (3, 24).
MTKO mice (19) and the genetically matched WT mice were
treated with DEN and PB (see Materials and Methods for
details). In this model, the male WT mice develop preneoplastic nodules at 23 weeks and liver tumors at 33 weeks after
DEN injection. The development of liver tumor in male mice is
consistent with the preponderance of HCC in human males.
We analyzed livers from the DEN or saline injected (control)
mice at 23 and 33 weeks after DEN treatment. The incidences
of tumorigenesis in DEN/PB-treated MTKO mice were higher
than those in WT mice at 23 weeks as attested by histologic
analysis and the number of tumors developed. Of the 8 MTKO
mice, 6 developed liver tumors as opposed to only 1 of 8 WT
mice (Table 1). At 33 weeks, all MTKO mice developed tumors
compared with 60% of the WT mice. Histopathologic analysis
of the livers (Fig. 1A, left) at 23 weeks showed multiple
macroscopic HCCs, and high-grade dysplastic nodules with
HCC foci in the MTKO, whereas the corresponding WT livers
were visibly normal and exhibited only low-grade dysplasia
(Fig. 1A, middle). Detection (Fig. 1A, right) and quantification
(bar diagram) of the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 revealed
10-fold increase (P ¼ 0.0005) in Ki-67–positive cells in the
MTKO mice compared with the WT mice. The liver body
weight ratios of MTKO/DEN mice were approximately 7%,
whereas in WT/DEN mice they were comparable to saline
injected control (4%; Fig. 1B). Strikingly, the number of
macroscopic HCCs in the MTKO mice was 4-fold higher than
that in WT mice at this time point (Fig. 1C). Neither MTKO nor
WT control mice developed spontaneous tumors when
injected with saline.
We monitored tumor growth at week 33 by MRI before
sacrificing the animals. The liver lesions were characterized by
high heterogeneity in signal intensity on T1-weighted images
as opposed to homogeneous liver tissue (Fig. 1D, left; Supplementary Fig. S1). The results were confirmed by T2-weighted
images in which tumors appeared hyperintense, whereas

normal liver tissue appeared hypointense for normal liver
tissue (Supplementary Fig. S1). We also analyzed the gross
tumor in the mice after sacrifice (Fig. 1D, middle), and
histopathology of the liver and tumor (Fig. 1D, right). The
livers at 33 weeks and 23 weeks exhibited essentially similar
patterns. MRI showed increase in number of tumor lesions in
the MTKO mice compared with the WT mice, which correlated with the number and size of tumors. Histologic analysis
revealed HCC in MTKO/DEN mice (Fig. 1D, ii) and high-grade
dysplastic nodules with hepatocellular adenoma in WT/DEN
mice (Fig. 1D, iii). The liver architecture was normal in the
untreated MTKO (Fig. 1D, i) and WT mice (data not shown).
The livers of MTKO/DEN mice weighed 18% of the body
weight compared with 6% in WT/DEN mice (Fig. 1E). Both
the tumor number (Fig. 1F, i) and tumor size (Fig. 1F, ii)
increased (3- to 4-fold) in MTKO mice compared with WT
mice. These data confirmed that MTKO mice are markedly
more susceptible to DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis than
the WT mice.
MTKO mice exhibit increased superoxide production
and liver damage in response to DEN
We next measured the levels of superoxide anions in the
livers of DEN-treated and control mice by staining with
dihydroethidine (DHE; ref. 20). DHE staining in MTKO/DEN
livers was 4.0-fold greater than that in the corresponding WT
livers (Fig. 2A). As expected, loss of MT resulted in relatively
high levels of superoxide accumulation. The serum alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) level at 23 weeks was 2.5-fold and 1.2fold higher in the DEN-treated MTKO and WT mice, respectively, compared with the untreated controls (Fig. 2B). Similarly, at 33 weeks, MTKO/DEN mice exhibited an
approximately 6.4-fold increase in the serum ALT (Fig. 2C)
and alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 2D) levels compared with
approximately just 1.5-fold increase in their levels in WT/
DEN mice compared with the corresponding untreated controls. The levels of both enzymes increased 4-fold in the sera of
MTKO/DEN mice compared with the WT/DEN mice. Further,
the expression of AFP, a HCC marker, was upregulated only in
the MTKO/DEN livers (Fig. 2E), again confirming the susceptibility of MTKO mice to hepatocarcinogenesis.
Microarray analysis unveils robust induction of protooncogenes in MTKO mice during hepatocarcinogenesis
To identify the key regulatory genes that contributed to
increased incidence of tumorigenesis in MTKO mice, hepatic
RNA from mice treated with DEN for 23 and 33 weeks was
subjected to Cancer Pathway Microarray analysis (including
113 gene specific oligos; see Supplementary Methods for
details). Total liver RNA of mice at 23 weeks of DEN treatment
was used to determine gross difference in gene expression
between the 2 genotypes. For the 33-week time point, RNA
from macrodissected tumors was used, as mice of both
genotypes had visible tumors. A total of 7 genes (Myc, Jun,
Fos, Ets2, Pai-1, Spp1, and Vegfa) were upregulated (1.5- to 2fold) at 23 weeks, whereas 16 genes were upregulated in
MTKO livers at 33 weeks (Supplementary Table S1). Surprisingly, the expression of only 2 genes, Apaf1 and Caspase 8, was

reduced by more than 50% in MTKO/DEN mice at 33 weeks.
The majority of the upregulated genes in MTKO livers at
23 weeks were proto-oncogenes. Real-time RT-PCR showed
15-, 4-, 2-, and 6-fold upregulation of Fos, Jun, Myc, and Ets2,
respectively, compared with WT/DEN mice (Fig. 3A). We used
b-2 microglobulin (b2M) and hydroxymethyl-bilane synthase
(HMBS; not shown) for normalization of real-time RT-PCR
data based on a report that b2M and HMBS were 2 out of the 6
most consistently expressed genes in primary HCCs and cell
lines (25). Even at 33 weeks, the expression of all 4 protooncogenes remained 2- to 5-fold higher in the tumors from
MTKO mice compared with those from the WT mice (Fig. 3B).
The expressions of all 4 genes in untreated MTKO and WT
livers were relatively low (Fig. 3A and B). Notably, the mRNA
level of Apaf1, a p53 target protein that initiates apoptosis, was
reduced by 60% at 33 weeks in MTKO/DEN mice (Supplementary Table S1; Fig. 3B, v), suggesting that the downregula-

tion of Apaf1 at this stage of hepatocarcinogenesis may
facilitate tumor growth in these mice by blocking apoptosis.
NF-kB pathway is differentially activated in MTKO mice
at early stage of DEN treatment
We next analyzed NF-kB DNA binding activity in the liver
nuclear extracts as several NF-kB target genes such as Myc,
Jun (Fig. 3), Pai-1, IL-1, IL-6, TNFa, (shown later), p53, and
Mmp9 (Supplementary Fig. S2) were significantly upregulated
in the MTKO/DEN livers at 23 weeks, which correlated with
histopathology (Fig. 1A–C). A low mobility complex (C1) and a
high mobility complex (C2) were formed with NF-kB consensus oligo (Fig. 4A). DEN treatment induced formation of
these 2 specific complexes (C1 and C2) in the liver nuclear
extracts of both WT and MTKO mice. Notably, the complex
detected in MTKO/DEN extracts was predominantly C2,
whereas complex C1 was the major one in WT/DEN mice

(Fig. 4A and B). The antibody supershift assay identified
complex C1 consisting exclusively of the p50 subunit that
fails to activate NF-kB target genes, whereas complex C2 is a
heterodimer of p50 and p65 subunits that can activate the NFkB downstream targets (Fig. 4C; ref. 26). Analysis of p65/
Ser276 phosphorylation, critical for p65 activation, revealed a
4-fold increase in the liver extracts from DEN-treated MTKO
mice compared with that in the extracts from WT/DEN mice
(Fig. 4D and E), which probably explains increased activation
of NF-kB target genes in the mutant mice.
The expression of Pai-1, an NF-kB target gene,
is dramatically elevated in MTKO mice at early stage
of DEN treatment
Next we explored the probable mechanism for the striking
induction of Pai-1, a NF-kB target, in the livers of MTKO/DEN
mice. Pai-1, a tissue glycoprotein, predominantly produced by
hepatocytes, facilitates extracellular matrix deposition by
inhibiting tPA/uPA-mediated matrix degradation (27) and
also facilitates angiogenesis (28). Real-time RT-PCR analysis
confirmed greater than 100-fold increase in Pai-1 mRNA
(Fig. 5A, top) and significantly higher Pai-1 protein levels
(Fig. 5A, middle and bottom) at 23 weeks in MTKO/DEN mice
compared with WT/DEN mice. Although Pai-1 expression was
significantly downregulated at 33 weeks, compared with 23
weeks, it remained 2-fold higher in the MTKO/DEN mice
compared with the WT/DEN group (Fig. 5B). This remarkable
increase in Pai-1 expression at 23 weeks led us to hypothesize
that Pai-1 is one of the key regulators contributing to the high
incidence of HCC in MTKO mice.
To elucidate the mechanism of DEN-induced increase in
Pai-1 expression we measured the levels of proinflammatory
cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-a, and IL-1b that positively
regulate Pai-1 expression via the NF-kB pathway (29). At 23
weeks, dramatic increase in the levels of IL-1b (12-fold), IL-6
(10-fold), and TNF-a (2- to 3-fold) was observed in the MTKO
mice relative to the WT mice and the untreated controls
(Fig. 5C, i–iii). Because these cytokines are both activators and
targets of NF-kB pathway, a close circuitry of NF-kB activation
and proinflammatory cytokine release in MTKO mice are
likely to facilitate tumorigenesis by increasing Pai-1 expression. In addition to the cytokines, the stress-inducible transcription factor ATF3 that has dichotomous roles in cancer
development, facilitating tumor growth and metastasis, has
been shown to activate Pai-1 expression (30). It is known that
oxidative stress strongly induces ATF3 (30). We, therefore,
hypothesized that the elevation of ATF3 could also contribute
to Pai-1 induction in the MTKO mice. Indeed, a dramatic
induction of ATF3 mRNA (46-fold; Fig. 5D) and protein
(Fig. 5E) levels in the MTKO/DEN mice were observed at
23 weeks, suggesting that ATF3 could be a key regulator of Pai1 expression in the MTKO mice. The downregulation of Pai-1
expression in MTKO/DEN mice at 33 weeks compared with
23 weeks could contribute to dramatic decrease in IL-6 and IL1b expressions along with reduced ATF3 expression at the
later time point (Supplementary Fig. S3). Comparison of Pai-1
and ATF3 expression in a panel of primary human liver tumor
and adjacent normal liver tissue demonstrated significantly

10272

Cancer Res; 70(24) December 15, 2010

high levels of Pai-1 protein (5 of 8 tumors) and ATF3 protein (6
of 8 tumors) compared with the adjacent liver tissue (Supplementary Fig. S4).
DEN-treated MTKO mice exhibit higher PDGF signaling
Microarray analysis revealed that platelet derived growth
factor (PDGF) expression was elevated 2-fold in MTKO/DEN
mice compared with the WT mice. Subsequent validation
indicated 3.5- and 2-fold increase in its expression at 23
and 33 weeks, respectively, after DEN treatment in MTKO
mice compared with the WT mice (Fig. 6A and B). The marked
increase in PDGF expression in the MTKO mice is consistent
with the induction of liver fibrosis followed by development of
adenoma and carcinoma observed in PDGF transgenic mice
(31).
Although serum growth factors (GF) regulate the amplitude
of the signaling by phosphorylating the receptor molecules,
the duration of specific signals is determined by the balance
between the activity of the downstream kinases and phosphatases. It is known that excessive free radical mediates
inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases (32), the key
enzymes involved in terminating the activating phosphorylation of GF receptors and p44/42MAPK (33). We, therefore,
hypothesized that this process allows sustained GF signaling
in the MTKO mice. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed
phospho-p44/42MAPK level in the whole liver extract from
DEN-treated and control mice after 23 weeks of DEN exposure. The higher level of pMAPK was observed exclusively in
the MTKO/DEN mice (>3.5-fold) compared with WT/DEN
(Fig. 6C). These data suggest that free radicals exert a positive
effect on GF signaling and support the notion that this
signaling in MTKO mice is prolonged because of increased
free radical accumulation probably by curtailing the phosphatase activity.

Discussion
Despite elaborate endogenous free radical scavenging
mechanisms that involve superoxide dismutase, catalase,
glutathione peroxidase, and heme oxygenase (34, 35), hepatocytes undergo transformation under sustained oxidative
stress. In this study, we analyzed the role of MT, a potent
free radical scavenger in protecting the liver from DENinduced carcinogenesis using MT knockout mice. Earlier
studies have shown that MTKO mice exhibit increased susceptibility to 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate–induced skin cancer (36) and MT
overexpression reduced hepatic hyperplasia induced by hepatitis B surface antigen (37). Besides transient increase in p53
and p21 expression in skin epithelium of MTKO mice, none of
these studies addressed detailed mechanistic insight into the
protective role of MT in carcinogenesis. The striking observations in our study were the increase in tumor size and
increased and early incidences of HCC in MTKO mice compared with the WT mice. The markedly higher liver damage,
liver weight, and tumor burden in the MTKO mice demonstrates a protective role of these 2 proteins from hepatocarcinogenesis. Further, this study has elucidated the probable

proinflammatory cytokines. In addition, stress-inducible protein ATF3 can also induce Pai-1. Upregulation of Pai-1 and other NF-kB target genes leads to cell
proliferation, liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis resulting in enhanced tumor growth. Unpaired Student's t-test; *, P  0.05; and ***, P  0.001 considered statistically

mechanisms for the rapid induction of hepatocarcinogenesis
on loss of MTs in the liver (see Fig. 6D for a model).
We have previously shown that Sod-1/ mice express
significantly higher levels of Mt-1/Mt-2 as a compensatory
mechanism compared with the Sod-1þ/þ mice (38). Further,
Sod-2 protects mouse embryonic fibroblasts from TNFainduced H2O2 accumulation and subsequent cell death (39).
Interestingly, we did not observe Sod-1/2 induction in the
MTKO/DEN mice as a compensatory mechanism (Supplementary Fig. S5). On the contrary, Sod-2 expression was curtailed by
20% in untreated MTKO mice compared with the WT mice and
was further reduced (25%) on DEN treatment. We have compared the level of GSH in the livers of untreated and DENtreated WT and MTKO mice to see if altered level of GSH
contributed to the increased incidence of tumorigenesis in the
MTKO mice. No significant difference in GSH level was
observed between the 2 genotypes irrespective of the treatment
conditions at 23 weeks (Supplementary Fig. S6). We also
analyzed expression of the stress response transcription factor
Nrf2 and its target genes Noq1 and Gclm to determine whether
additional oxidative stress modulated expression of these
genes differentially in the MTKO/DEN mice. Although Nrf2
expression was downregulated in MTKO/DEN mice compared
with the corresponding untreated mice, there was no significant difference in the expression of Nrf2 or its target genes
between WT/DEN and MTKO/DEN livers (Supplementary
Fig. S7). These observations coupled with the significant
increase (>3-fold) in superoxide level in MTKO/DEN livers
(Fig. 2A) could explain the differential upregulation of growth
promoting genes at early stages of hepatocarcinogenesis and
might also contribute to enhanced tumorigenesis in these mice.
NF-kB activation has been shown to be the key molecular
event orchestrating response to inflammation (40). The
importance of this pathway in hepatocarcinogenesis has been
elegantly demonstrated using mice lacking IKkb in hepatocytes (3). The differential activation of NF-kB in the MTKO
mice probably facilitated the cross-talk between the surviving
hepatocytes and the tumor microenvironment supporting
tumor growth. Relatively higher level of proinflammatory
cytokines observed in MTKO/DEN mice could play a key role
in differential activation of p65. This is most likely achieved by
phosphorylation and degradation of the IkB protein in the
inactive cytoplasmic complex of NF-kB:IkB:PKAc and PKAcmediated phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276 residue that
activates p65 (41). Indeed, our data demonstrate increased
phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276 in MTKO/DEN mice that is
probably the key mechanism of NF-kB activation in the MTKO

mice. It is conceivable that the lack of MT at an early stage of
tumorigenesis enhances the NF-kB pathway leading to activation of prosurvival genes in HCC patients.
Of the several NF-kB target genes differentially activated in
the MTKO/DEN mice, the activation of Pai-1 is striking and
could be responsible for the higher incidence of tumors in the
MTKO livers. Pai-1 harbors an NF-kB binding site in its
promoter that directly regulates its activity (29). The positive
regulators of Pai-1, namely, IL-1b, TNF-a, and IL-6 were
significantly upregulated in the MTKO/DEN mice. Although
TGFb was reported to be the key regulator of Pai-1 via Smad3L
phosphorylation in hepatitis C–infected HCC patients (42), the
increase in TGFb in the MTKO mice was marginal at 23 weeks
(data not shown). This implicates the involvement of IL-1b,
IL-6, and TNF-a in the upregulation of Pai-1 in this model. To
validate our hypothesis that the lack of MT plays a causal role
in Pai-1 upregulation, we measured its expression in MT null
mouse fibroblasts (43). The basal level of Pai-1 was 14-fold
higher in MTKO cells compared with the WT cells (Supplementary Fig. S8). Treatment with H2O2 demonstrated a 2-fold
increase in Pai-1 expression in WT cells, but not in MTKO
cells, thus supporting our hypothesis.
In conclusion, MT suppression frequently observed in human
liver tumors probably facilitates aberrant activation of several
growth promoting signals that contribute to liver tumorigenesis. On the basis of these observations, it is conceivable that
reintroduction of MT genes into the liver alone or in combination with current therapeutic regimens can be considered an
alternative strategy to existing HCC therapy.
