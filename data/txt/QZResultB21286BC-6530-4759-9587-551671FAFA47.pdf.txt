Thalidomide Therapy in Adult Patients With
Myelodysplastic Syndrome
A North Central Cancer Treatment Group
Phase II Trial
he results recently published in Cancer by Moreno-Aspitia et al.1
concerning the unsatisfactory therapeutic effects of thalidomide
in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) warrant some comments. This
study was designed in 1998, the enrollment of patients closed in
2002, and the full paper published in 2006. During this very long
time, at least 4, noncited, additional articles dealing with the same
topic were published,2–5 reporting an overall response rate ranging
from 16 to 56% in the intention-to-treat setting and from 31% up to
88% when considering only patients able to receive the drug for an
adequate time (12–16 weeks). The high drop-out rate due to severe
side-effects that occurred, likely correlated with the very high thalidomide doses employed in their study, certainly contributed to the
quite different and disappointing results obtained by Moreno-Aspitia and coworkers. However, there are other possible reasons to
explain such differences, ﬁrst of all, the selection of patients. Moreno-Aspitia et al. enrolled not only anemic subjects but also
patients with transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia or marked
neutropenia. It is now clear by other studies that the large majority
of responses in MDS patients who are receiving thalidomide are
erythroid in nature and that patients with ‘‘advanced disease’’ (criterion for inclusion in that trial) are signiﬁcantly less prone to
respond. This is particularly true if these patients have a long history of disease, as suggested by the very short median survival (only
17 months!) observed even in the ‘‘favourable group’’, which
included patients with an International Prognostic Scoring System
(IPSS) score of 0–1, who usually have an expected survival of 3–5
years. In addition, the elevated mean age of patients and the high
proportion of MDS with blast excess reported also represent potential predictive factors of poor response to thalidomide. Indeed, in
our updated, still unpublished experience, which currently includes
67 anemic, transfusion-dependent MDS patients treated with thalidomide, patients aged younger than 70 years, with anemia as single
cytopenia, no blast excess, and a short history of disease had the
highest chance (62.5%) to obtain an interruption of their red cell
transfusional support after a treatment with individualized (but no
more than 200 mg/day) doses of thalidomide. In particular, we
observed signiﬁcant (and sometimes long-lasting) erythroid responses
even in patients who did not tolerate ‘‘conventional’’ (100–200 mg/
day) doses of thalidomide, but who were able to assume 50 mg/day or
even on alternate days for at least 3 months.
Thus, in my opinion, thalidomide remains a possible therapeutic
option for selected MDS patients, if appropriately used and managed.

acknowledge in this letter the important contributions of Drs. Strup, Musto, Bouscary, Bowen, and colleagues2–5 to this subject, and we agree with these
investigators that the population most likely to beneﬁt with this agent may be those patients with earlier
stage disease, younger age, and anemia as the only
signiﬁcant blood cytopenia. We concluded that the
use of thalidomide in unselected patients with MDS
at the dose and schedule used in this trial was not
warranted. However, we believe that even at a lower
dose, the tolerability of this agent by patients with
MDS is limited. On the basis of preliminary results
of the multicenter trial of lenalidomide in patients
with non-5q minus low-risk and intermediate-1 risk
MDS presented by Drs. Raza and List6 that showed
signiﬁcant activity and minimal toxicity, we believe
this analog of thalidomide would be a better option
for these patients.

e would like to thank Dr. Musto for his
thoughtful comments concerning our recently
published article1 on the use of thalidomide in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Although the protocol
was originally written in early 1998 with a maximum
target dose of 200 mg per day of thalidomide, the
protocol was not activated until the year 2001
because of initial skepticism of the potential beneﬁts
of thalidomide in this hematologic disorder. For similar reasons, only patients with very advanced disease and any performance status were eligible to
participate in this trial. As previously noted, the
therapeutic results of this trial were unsatisfactory
and were published as such without an attempt to
make the article under discussion a comprehensive
review of the use of thalidomide in MDS. We do
