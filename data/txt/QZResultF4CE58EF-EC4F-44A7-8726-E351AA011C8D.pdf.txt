Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

c-Met represents an important emerging therapeutic target in cancer. Here, we demonstrate the
mechanism by which c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibition inhibits tumor growth in a highly invasive
Asian-prevalent head and neck cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). c-Met tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs; AM7 and c-Met TKI tool compound SU11274) downregulated c-Met
phosphorylation resulting in markedly inhibited growth and invasion of NPC cells. Strikingly,
inhibition of c-Met resulted in marked downregulation of TIGAR (TP53-induced Glycolysis and
Apoptosis Regulator) and subsequent depletion of intracellular NADPH. Importantly,
overexpression of TIGAR ameliorated the effects of c-Met kinase inhibition, confirming the
importance of TIGAR downregulation in growth inhibition induced by c-Met TKI. The effects of
c-Met inhibition on TIGAR and NADPH levels were observed with two different c-Met TKIs
(AM7 and SU11274) and with multiple cell lines. As NADPH provides a crucial reducing power
required for cell survival and proliferation, our findings represent a novel mechanistic action of cMet TKI, which may represent a key effect of c-Met kinase inhibition. Our data provides the first
evidence linking c-Met, TIGAR and NADPH regulation in human cancer cells suggesting that
inhibition of a tyrosine kinase/TIGAR/NADPH cascade may have therapeutic applicability in
human cancers.

Introduction
c-Met is rapidly emerging as an important target for cancer therapy. Overexpression of cMet is associated with poor patient survival or metastasis in numerous human malignancies
(Comoglio et al., 2008). Cumulative in vitro and in vivo evidences demonstrates that c-Met
targeting can effectively attenuate tumor growth, invasion and metastasis (Comoglio et al.,
2008), however, the mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Phase I and II human clinical
trials of multiple c-Met targeting approaches are currently underway, including monoclonal
antibodies against HGF (hepatocyte growth factor, the ligand of c-Met) and small molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) against c-Met. Although the results of clinical trials are yet
to be revealed, many of the c-Met TKIs demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy in
inhibiting tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, as well as angiogenesis (Comoglio et al.,
2008) resulting in optimism for the approach.

Gain-of-function aberrations affecting c-Met, which causes inappropriate activation of cMet, is an oncogenic event (Cooper et al., 1984; Wang et al., 2001). In various cancers,
gain-of-function of c-Met occurs via genetic alterations (e.g. gene amplification or
rearrangement, activating mutation), overexpression (by transcriptional upregulation), as
well as upregulation of its ligand, HGF (Comoglio et al., 2008; Nakamura et al., 2008).
Although the incidence of activating c-Met mutation or gene rearrangement is relatively low
in human cancers, overexpression of c-Met protein (either via transcriptional activation or
gene amplification) is observed in >50–80% of a wide variety of cancers (Comoglio et al.,
2008). Recently, Wang et al showed that overexpression of wildtype c-Met in hepatocytes
was sufficient to cause liver cancer (Wang et al., 2001), providing support for c-Met
overexpression being a causal event in cancer. Targeting of aberrant c-Met activation, either
overexpression of wildtype or activating mutants of c-Met, has demonstrated therapeutic
efficacy in diverse cancer models (Stabile et al., 2004; Comoglio et al., 2008).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In view of this, several novel and versatile c-Met inhibitors with potent inhibitory activities
against both overexpressed wildtype as well as activating mutants of c-Met have been
developed (Bellon et al., 2008). AM7 is a recently developed c-Met inhibitor with a distinct
binding mode to c-Met as compared to classical c-Met TKI “tool compound” (e.g.
SU11274) (Bellon et al., 2008). X-ray crystallography revealed that AM7 binds to the kinase
linker region and extends into a hydrophobic binding site of c-Met, thus allowing interaction
with and subsequent inhibition of both wildtype and mutated c-Met (Bellon et al., 2008).
Preclinical studies are underway to determine the therapeutic efficacy of this new class of cMet TKI.
Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is a highly metastatic head and neck cancer prevalent in Asia,
with an annual incidence of 15-30/100,000cases/year (comparable to that of pancreatic
cancer in the US)(Yu and Yuan, 2002; Anderson et al., 2006). Over 60–70% of NPC
patients have advanced disease (Stage IIb or IV) at the time of diagnosis. c-Met
overexpression correlates with poor survival and metastasis in NPC (Qian et al., 2002),
suggesting that c-Met may be an etiological agent and therapeutic target in this disease. In
this study, we demonstrate that inhibition of c-Met (by AM7 and a c-Met TKI tool
compound SU11274) blocks growth and invasion of NPC cells. Strikingly, c-Met inhibition
decreased p53 and downregulated TIGAR, resulting in a significant reduction of cellular
NADPH levels. As NADPH provides reducing power required for cell survival and

proliferation, this may represent a novel mechanistic target of c-Met TKI. Indeed,
overexpression of TIGAR rescued NPC cells from both AM7- and SU11274-mediated
growth inhibition, demonstrating the mechanistic importance of TIGAR down-modulation.
The effects of c-Met inhibition on TIGAR and NADPH levels were generalizable with both
c-Met TKIs (AM7 and SU11274) demonstrating activity across multiple cell lines. Our
findings not only demonstrated the therapeutic potential of c-Met targeting in NPC, but also
revealed novel effects of c-Met targeting on NADPH regulation in cancer cells via TIGAR.
Our study provides the first evidence linking c-Met, TIGAR and NADPH regulation in
cancer cells, suggesting that inhibition of a tyrosine kinase/TIGAR/NADPH cascade may
have therapeutic applicability in cancer treatment.

Results and Discussions
AM7 inhibits NPC cell proliferation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

c-Met is frequently overexpressed in NPC patients, as well as NPC cell lines(Qian et al.,
2002). As shown in Figure 1A, most NPC cell lines, except C666-1, expressed high levels of
total c-Met and phoshorylated c-Met, which serves as a surrogate for activated c-Met, under
basal (10% FBS) and serum-starved conditions, albeit frequently with lower levels in serumstarved cells. The effect of AM7 on NPC cell growth was examined. A well-known c-Met
TKI-sensitive cell line, NCI-H1993 (with c-Met gene amplification) was also included as a
positive control. As shown in Figure 1B, inhibition of c-Met with AM7 induced a dosedependent growth inhibition in both NCI-H1993 and 4/5 NPC cell lines tested. Cumulative
results demonstrated that AM7-mediated growth inhibition of NPC cell lines was
comparable to that of NCI-H1993 at 2μM concentration as early as 48h (n≥9–21; p<0.01**,
p<0.0001***), except for C666-1 (n≥12; p>0.05, ns). It is important to note that Het-1A, a
normal esophageal epithelial control cell line (ATCC, USA) has undetectable levels of cMet (by Western blotting of up to 50μg total protein, Supplementary Figure 1A), was not
sensitive to AM7 (Supplementary Figure 1B). Our data indicate that inhibition of c-Met with
AM7, a new c-Met TKI, can specifically abrogate growth of NPC cells with c-Met
overexpression/activation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although AM7 has the ability to target both wildtype and mutated c-Met, the sensitivity of
NPC cell lines towards AM7 was not due to mutation of the c-Met tyrosine kinase (TK).
Mutational analysis of the c-Met tyrosine kinase domain (nucleotide 3232–4011 of coding
sequence, which represents the most common site of activating mutations in c-Met) of all
five NPC cell lines revealed that c-Met TK domain mutation was uncommon in NPC cells
with all detectable nucleotide changes in the TK domain being “silent mutations”, conferring
no change in amino acid sequence (Supplementary Table 1). Although it is unclear whether
other activating c-Met mutations occur in NPC patients, our results demonstrated that
inhibition of c-Met may demonstrate therapeutic efficacy even in the absence of activating
c-Met mutation. Interestingly, the NPC cell lines with comparable AM7 sensitivity to NCIH1993 (known to be c-Met TKI-responsive due to c-Met gene amplification) do not carry
any c-Met gene amplification as analyzed by FISH analysis (Supplementary Figure 1C).
AM7 inhibits c-Met signaling and reduced invasiveness of NPC cells
Next, we investigated the mechanistic effects of AM7 on c-Met signaling in two
representative NPC cell lines with that were sensitive to AM7 (namely HK1-LMP1, an
EBV-associated NPC cell line expressing the EBV oncoprotein, the latent membrane protein
1 [LMP1]; and CNE-2 with poorly differentiated NPC origin). In both cell lines, AM7
exhibited potent inhibition of c-Met phosphorylation as early as 2h, while total c-Met level
remained unchanged (Figure 2A). Blockade of c-Met signaling by AM7 also led to
inhibition of several major downstream signaling pathways including STAT3 and p44/42

MAPK. In both HK1-LMP1 and CNE-2, AM7 induced a dose-dependent inhibition of
STAT3 phosphorylation (Tyr705) and p44/42 MAPK activation as early as 2h (Figure 2B),
which agreed with previous time courses of c-Met inhibition (Ma et al., 2007). Similar
results were observed in another LMP1-expressing and AM7-sensitive NPC cell line,
CNE-2-LMP1 (Supplementary Figure 2). The effect of AM7 on AKT pathway was more
significant in CNE-2 than in the two LMP1-expressing NPC cell lines, HK1-LMP1 (Figure
2B) and CNE-2-LMP1 (Supplementary Figure 2B). Although our data suggests a potential
involvement of different downstream signaling effectors of c-Met in NPC cells with or
without LMP1 expression, AM7 efficiently inhibited signaling downstream of c-Met in
several NPC cell lines.
The effect of AM7 on the invasiveness of NPC cells was also examined as c-Met has been
clinically implicated in NPC progression (Horikawa et al., 2001). As shown in Figure 3A,
AM7 (2μM) significantly inhibited cellular invasion (by Matrigel invasion assay) in both
cell lines with the invasiveness of HK1-LMP1 and CNE-2 being reduced by AM7 by 44%
and 39% respectively, when compared to DMSO control. The c-Met TKI, SU11274 was
also effective in inhibiting cellular invasiveness (Figure 3B). Our results suggest that
inhibition of c-Met by both AM7 and SU11274 blocks both NPC cell invasion and
proliferation.

AM7 and SU11274 reduce TIGAR expression and cellular NADPH level in NPC cells
Since c-Met is a key regulator of cell survival and apoptosis(Tulasne and Foveau, 2008), we
investigated the effects of AM7 on apoptosis. Using a quantitative Cell Death Detection
ELISA assay measuring DNA fragmentation (Roche Diagnostics, Germany), we
demonstrated that AM7 was able to induce apoptosis in NPC cell lines as early as 48h
(Figure 4A).
Unexpectedly, a newly described regulator of apoptosis and glycolysis, TIGAR (TP53induced Glycolysis and Apoptosis Regulator)(Bensaad et al., 2006), was markedly reduced
by AM7 in both cell lines. The observed reduction of TIGAR expression was consistent with
reduced expression of its upstream regulator, p53 (Figure 4A).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

TIGAR has recently been found to be a dual regulator of apoptosis and glycolysis. It has
been postulated that TIGAR may inhibit apoptosis via regulation of cellular NADPH levels
(through modulation of the pentose phosphate pathway) (Bensaad et al., 2006). NADPH
provides the major reducing power in mammalian cells, which is critical for protection of
cells from oxidative stress/damage, as well as for reductive biosynthesis of important
biomolecules, including DNA, RNA, fatty acids, and cholesterol. Rapidly proliferating cells
thus require NADPH for normal function, proliferation and survival. Our finding that c-Met
blockade by AM7 downregulated TIGAR expression in NPC cells suggested a potential
effect of this c-Met TKI on cellular NADPH production. As shown in Figure 4B, AM7
reduced intracellular NADPH in both HK1-LMP1 and CNE-2 cells by 47–49%, when
compared to DMSO control. Similar results were observed with SU11274 indicating that the
effects are generalizable to multiple modes of c-Met inhibition (Figure 4C). This provides
the first demonstration in human cancer cells that c-Met inhibition could result in significant
reduction of cellular NADPH, the key reducing power in mammalian cells. This novel
finding was consistent with the demonstration that specific downregulation of TIGAR by
siRNA induced cancer cell death by altering the pentose phosphate pathway (Bensaad et al.,
2006), which is the major pathway regulating the production of cellular NADPH. Our data
implicates a potential link between c-Met signaling and NADPH regulation in cancer cells.
Since AM7-induced TIGAR downregulation was accompanied by reduction of NADPH
levels in NPC cells, and rapidly proliferating cells require NADPH for proliferation and

survival, we hypothesized that TIGAR downregulation might contribute to AM7-induced
growth inhibition of NPC cells. We performed rescue experiments to determine if
overexpression of TIGAR could reverse growth inhibition in NPC cells induced by c-Met
TKIs. Using retrovirus infection, we generated stable cell lines expressing TIGAR protein
(human TIGAR gene construct was purchased from Origene, USA) (Figure 4D). In
comparison with the vector control stable cell lines (pLPCX vector), TIGAR-expression in
the stable cell lines was able to reduce the growth inhibitory effects of AM7 (at both 1 and
2μM) at 72h. Similarly, TIGAR-overexpression was also able to reduce SU11274-mediated
NPC cell growth inhibition (at both 2 and 5μM doses) at 72h. In the faster-growing NPC
cell line, HONE-1, a marked rescue from AM7 and SU11274-induced growth inhibition by
TIGAR-overexpression was also observed even under serum-deprivation (Supplementary
Figure 3). Our results established for the first time the mechanistic involvement of TIGAR
in c-Met TKI-mediated growth inhibition in NPC cells.
In summary, our study not only demonstrates the therapeutic potential of c-Met targeting in
NPC, but also provides the first demonstration of a novel antitumor mechanism of c-Met
TKIs in inhibiting TIGAR expression and NADPH levels in human cancer cells. Our data
provides the first evidence linking c-Met, TIGAR and NADPH regulation in human cancer
cells, suggesting that inhibition of a tyrosine kinase/TIGAR/NADPH cascade may have
therapeutic applicability in cancer treatment.

maintained as previously described (Horikawa et al., 2001; Tulasne and Foveau, 2008).
Basal levels of c-Met and activated c-Met in 10% FBS or under serum-starvation for 24h
were shown for 5 NPC cell lines. A c-Met-TKI sensitive cell line, NCI-H1993 (non-small
cell lung cancer cell line with c-Met gene amplification; purchased from ATCC, USA) was
included as positive control for drug sensitivity. Phospho-c-Met was detected by
immunoprecipitation as previously described (Zhang et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2009).
Phosphorylated c-Met was immunopreciptated with c-Met antibody (C-12) and probed with
phospho-Tyr99 antibody (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA). Right: HK1-LMP1
showed comparable basal level of phospho-c-Met to that of NCI-H1993. (B) Dosedependent growth inhibition of NPC cell lines by AM7. AM7 was kindly provided by
Amgen Inc., USA. Both NCI-H1993 (positive control cell line) and NPC cell lines were
treated with increasing doses of AM7 (0.1, 1, 2μM) or DMSO (vehicle) for 48h. Percentage
growth inhibition (vs DMSO) was determined in triplicate for each independent experiment
(mean ± SEM) by MTT assay as previously described (Lui et al., 2007). Bar graph shows

induces dose-dependent reduction of intracellular NADPH in NPC cells. HK1-LMP1
and CNE-2 cells were treated with AM7 (2μM) or DMSO in complete medium for 48h.
Cellular NADPH production was measured at 30min according to the manufacturer’s
instruction (See details in Supplementary Information) and normalized to total protein as
μM/min/mg total protein. Percentage reduction of NADPH was calculated with reference to
DMSO. Graph show percentage reduction of NADPH level of AM7-treated cells vs DMSOtreated cells (mean ± SEM, n=3). Similar results were obtained in 3 independent
experiments. (C) A model c-Met TKI, SU11274 downregulates TIGAR and NADPH
levels in NPC cells. HK1-LMP1 and CNE-2 cells were treated with SU11274 or DMSO in
complete medium for 48h. Cellular NADPH production was determined as above. The
expression levels of TIGAR and p53 were also shown. (D) Overexpression of TIGAR
rescues NPC cells from both AM7- and SU11274-mediated growth inhibition. Infective
retroviruses expressing human TIGAR gene (original gene construct of human TIGAR was
obtained from Origene, USA) or the control vector (pLPCX control vector for retroviral
gene delivery; Clontech, USA) were generated. Retrovirus infection into NPC cells (CNE-2
and HONE-1) was performed, followed by puromycin selection (400ng/ml) as previously
described (Lui et al., 2009b). Upon confirmation of TIGAR overexpression (by Western
blotting for TIGAR; Upper Panel) in these stable cell lines, puromycin selection was
removed periodically. Retrovirus-infected stable cell lines from CNE-2 and HONE-1 origin
were treated with AM7 (2μM) or SU11274 (5μM) or DMSO in 3% FBS for 72h. Effects of
TIGAR overexpression on AM7- or SU11274-induced growth inhibition (as % growth

lower panels, respectively. Similar results were obtained in 3 independent experiments.
