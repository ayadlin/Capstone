Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The US National Cancer Institute (NCI), in collaboration with scientists representing multiple
areas of expertise relevant to ‘omics’-based test development, has developed a checklist of criteria
that can be used to determine the readiness of omics-based tests forguiding patient care in clinical
trials. The checklist criteria cover issues relating to specimens, assays, mathematical modelling,
clinical trial design, and ethical, legal and regulatory aspects. Funding bodies and journals are
encouraged to consider the checklist, which they may find useful for assessing study quality and
evidence strength. The checklist will be used to evaluate proposals for NCI-sponsored clinical
trials in which omics tests will be used to guide therapy.
High-throughput ‘omics’ technologies hold great promise to provide detailed
characterization of diseases to more effectively predict a patient's clinical course or to select
the most beneficial therapies (see Box 1). These technologies have been embraced

enthusiastically in oncology, as the heterogeneous character of malignant diseases presents
substantial challenges for cancer detection, prognosis and optimal selection of therapy.
Many preclinical studies using these technologies to elucidate biological features and
mechanisms have been published, and retrospective studies applying omics assays to stored
human biospecimens have been conducted to develop mathematical models to predict
clinical endpoints such as survival or response to therapy.
Despite numerous publications, however, few omics-based predictors have been translated
successfully into clinically useful tests. A factor that contributes to the slow pace of clinical
translation is the challenge of assessing whether the body of evidence for an omics-based
test is sufficiently comprehensive and reliable that the test is ready for definitive evaluation
in a clinical trial in which it could be used to direct patient care. Translation from researchgrade omics assays to clinical-grade omics-based tests1 requires a rigorous development and
validation process with attention to the complexities of omics assays and their application to
clinical specimens, specialized expertise required to appropriately develop and evaluate
mathematical predictor models built from high-dimensional data, and multiple ethical, legal
and regulatory issues.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recently there have been some widely publicized cases of premature advancement of omicsbased tests to use in trials in which they were used to guide patient treatment decisions.
These cases led to calls for examination of the field of translational omics. The Institute of
Medicine (IOM) conducted a study1 to review the field and formed the Committee on the
Review of Omics-Based Tests for Predicting Patient Outcomes in Clinical Trials. The
group's task statement included recommending an evaluation process for determining when
omics tests are fit for use in clinical trials and applying it to several specific cases of
premature use of omics-based tests1. The resulting report laid out a three-phase process for
the development and evaluation of omics-based tests for use in clinical trials: the discovery
phase, the test validation phase, and the evaluation for clinical utility and use stage.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

During the IOM committee deliberations, the NCI convened a workshop to bring together
scientists and stakeholders who had an interest in this area of research to stimulate
community dialogue. Subsequently, a working group was formed to develop a checklist that
would operationalize the principles set forth in the IOM report and the NCI workshop
discussions.
The results of those efforts are presented in Table 1, which lists 30 criteria that should be
addressed to determine the readiness of an omics test for use in a prospective clinical trial.
These criteria apply to any clinical trial involving the investigational use of an omics test
that will influence the clinical management of patients in the trial; for example, the selection
of therapy. These criteria cover not only the strength of evidence in support of an omics test
but also the practical issues that must be considered before the test is used in a clinical
setting. The criteria can also be helpful in assessing the reliability and credibility of an omics
predictor to justify its use on valuable non-renewable archived specimens collected from
patients who were prospectively enrolled in previous clinical studies. This paper presents the
criteria in checklist form with brief background. Readers are referred to a recently published

criterion.

Specimen issues
Molecular profiles generated by the use of omics technologies can be sensitive to specimen
collection, processing and storage conditions3. Investigators should consider the conditions
under which specimens used in developmental studies were collected and handled to assess
the robustness of an omics test to various specimen conditions. It may be necessary to
conduct additional feasibility studies to document that the omics test will perform
satisfactorily under the range of conditions in which the specimens will be obtained and
stored in typical clinical settings; alternatively, more restrictive requirements for specimen
collection, processing and storage should be clearly specified before the test is used in a
clinical trial or other clinical validation study.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Criteria for specimen quality, amount (mass or volume), and composition should be clearly
specified in order to qualify a specimen or its isolated analytes as suitable for assay by the
omics test. Appropriate criteria will depend on the specimen type and the particular omics
assay platform to be used. Details of the specification might include per cent purity of the
target cells or intact analyte of interest and specific mass or volume of the specimen or
analytes isolated from the specimen. It should be established that it is feasible to achieve
these criteria in clinical settings.

Assay issues

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Variations in assay procedures due to differences in technical protocols, reagents, and
scoring and reporting methods can have a substantial impact on the analytical performance
of an omics assay and its comparability among laboratories4,5. Many omics tests are
developed using data from retrospective studies in which these aspects of the assay were not
standardized. This can lead to uncertainties in how the test will perform when based on
assay data from a new laboratory, including the laboratory or laboratories that will generate
the assay data for a prospective trial. It is important to develop detailed standard operating
procedures (SOPs) for the assay underlying the omics test and to establish that studies
conducted previously to clinically validate the omics test were based on data expected to be
comparable to new data generated under the specified SOPs.
Analytical performance of the omics assay under the proposed SOPs must be documented
and found to be acceptable in terms of metrics such as accuracy, precision, coefficient of
variation, sensitivity, specificity, linear range, limit of detection, and limit of quantification,
as applicable. Calibrators, analytical standards, and controls are essential components of the
SOPs and should be described clearly. Quality assurance procedures should include criteria
for acceptance or rejection of assay batches and results from individual specimens. When
multiple technicians or laboratories will conduct the assays, monitoring procedures should
be in place to ensure comparability acrosstechnicians and laboratories.Methods for assay
scoring and reporting should be clearly specified. Turnaround times for return of test results
should be within acceptable limits that will be dependent on the particular clinical situation
and should be sufficiently rapid to not impede clinical management timelines. Feasibility

studies to assess assay analytical performance, reproducibility and turnaround times may be
required in advance of initiating a clinical trial to firmly establish the suitability of the omics
test for use in a real-time clinical setting.

Model development and evaluation
Many omics tests are developed using existing omics, clinical and pathology data or using
data generated from retrospective specimen collections. These data may be incomplete or
unreliable and should be examined for errors, inconsistencies or bias. Omics assays can be
sensitive to a variety of ancillary technical influences that result in artefacts in the generated
data. Of particular concern is the potential for such artefacts to be confounded with clinical
variables or endpoints. Efforts should be made to identify potential confounders, including
source of specimens (for example, clinical sites processing specimens differently),
laboratory performing the omics assay, and assay batches6.

Examples of flawed applications of statistical approaches for development of omics
predictors and for evaluation of their performance are abundant in the literature7–9. Model
overfitting, which occurs when a statistical model describes random noise instead of
capturing the true association between predictor variables and a clinical endpoint, is a
common problem in omics research projects, in which the number of analytes measured per
specimen exceeds the number of specimens studied. Overfitting can be reduced by the use of
model ‘regularization’ approaches that constrain the complexity of the model, but these
approaches do not completelyeliminate overfittingrisk. Itis common forresearchers without
the appropriate expertise to misunderstand and misapply modelling techniques. In addition,
if flawed methods for model performance assessment are used, then overfitting may escape
detection. A common mistake is failure to maintain strict separation between data used to
build a model (‘training set’) and data used to assess model performance (‘testing set’).
Numerous published papers have inappropriately reported model performance estimates
based on resubstitution of data used to build a model back into that same model. These socalled ‘resubstitution estimates’ are severely (optimistically) biased. Assessment of model
performance on the combined training and testing data sets is similarly problematic. Re-use
of training data is acceptable only if performed properly using data resampling methods10
that iteratively split the trainingdata tohold out subsetsof the data that are not used for model
building and can therefore be used to check model performance.
Development of an omics predictor can be an iterative process involving several adjustments
to improve performance. With regard to the three phases of the development and evaluation
process in the IOM report1 on omics tests, it is noted in the report that preliminary
validations may occur in the test validation phase, and the definitive evaluation of clinical
utility takes place in the final phase. It is important to be able to discern the point at which
the omics test is ‘locked down’, or finalized, in all aspects, including specimen
requirements, technical protocol for assay, data preprocessing, the form of mathematical
predictor model, and interpretation of the test result. The test is then ready to enter the final
evaluation for clinical utility and use stage, at which there are three basic options for clinical
utility evaluation: first, a prospective evaluation of the omics test on a retrospective
specimen collection from a clinical trial or prospective cohort study; second, a prospective

clinical trial in which the test does not direct patient management; and third, a prospective
clinical trial in which the omics test is used to direct patient management. Ideally, there
should have been a blinded and rigorous preliminary validation of performance of the
locked-down model on an external independent specimen set during the test validation
phase. If an independent external validation set is not possible because adequate specimen
collections do not exist, then existing performance evaluations based on internal validations
should be carefully reviewed to ensure that they were rigorous and used appropriate
methods. In this situation, it may be necessary to use a clinical trial design that does not
allow the test to influence patient care.
When further adjustments are made to the omics test or data after the final validation data
have been unblinded, there is a risk of compromising the validation. If the omics test is
adjusted, either a new validation must be performed or additional evidence must be
obtained; for example, by conducting an assay-bridging study to ensure that the adjustments
to the test have not adversely affected its performance.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Investigators should be prepared to supply data and computer code as part of the review
process for proposals to use omics tests in clinical trials. It is highly recommended that
investigators follow reproducible research practices so that they will be able to supply the
needed information quickly and easily for verification of the validation of the test and its
locked-down form. Readers are referred to the companion publication2 for further discussion
of recommended reproducible research practices.

Clinical trial design

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A clinical trial for definitive evaluation of an omics test should be conducted using the same
rigorous standards expected for clinical trials evaluating experimental therapies. In some
circumstances, high-level evidence can be obtained by use of specimens from an alreadycompleted clinical trial11. Accepted standards for good clinical practice must be
followed12,13, including development of a formal protocol with clearly stated objectives and
eligibility criteria, an informatics plan for management of clinical and omics data, a prespecified study design14 and statistical analysis plan, complete specification of the omics
test, and justification for equipoise for any treatment randomizations (if the trial is
conducted prospectively). The study team must include individuals with appropriate
expertise to assume responsibility for the clinical, laboratory, pathology, bioinformatics,
data management and statistical aspects of the study.

Ethical, legal and regulatory issues
Numerous ethical, legal and regulatory issues must be addressed in the course of developing
an omics test for clinical use. Research involving human subjects, which includes
retrospective use of specimens from living subjects, requires that adequate protection is in
place to ensure the safety of patients and the privacy and confidentiality of patient
information15. Ensuring appropriate protections has become more challenging as omics
technologies make it possible to provide detailed genetic characterizations of individuals and
much research data are made publicly available. Informed consent documents for a clinical
trial using an omics test to guide patient management must accurately describe any potential

risks from participation in a study and all potential conflicts of interest on the part of study
investigators or sponsoring institutions. Laboratory tests must be conducted in environments
that meet Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments certification requirements if the
results will be reported to the patient or the patient's physician16. Responsible parties at
participating institutions (for example, institutional review boards, protocol review
committees), trial sponsors (for example, the NCI, universities, companies), and the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (for example, for Investigational Device Exemption
(IDE)17 or Investigational New Drug18 applications) must be fully informed of study details
and approve the study before it proceeds.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

If the omics assay to be used in a clinical trial could be considered a significant-risk assay,
including—but not limited to—one used to choose among treatments, investigators must
consult with the FDA to determine whether an IDE from the Center for Devices and
Radiologic Health, or a similar evaluation carried out throughthe
InvestigationalNewDrugprocess, is required. The complexities of omics-based tests, together
with the FDA's evolving view of regulatory enforcement discretion for these tests, make it
important to have early communications with the FDA. Investigators may find it helpful to
discuss the trial formally with the FDA in a pre-submission process if they are not familiar
with IDE requirements19.
Intellectual property issues may apply to the use of the specimens, biomarkers, assays, and
computer software used for calculation of the predictor. Intellectual property rights should
be documented and respected by all parties involved. Potential conflicts of interest of study
investigators must be disclosed and managed.

Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Evaluation of the readiness of an omics test to be used for clinical care requires careful
consideration of the body of evidence supporting the test's analytical and clinical validity
and potential clinical utility, as well as an understanding of ethical, legal and regulatory
issues. Funding bodies and journals are encouraged to consider using the checklist as an
evaluation guide in their review processes. The NCI plans to use the checklist presented here
to evaluate proposals for the use of omics tests in clinical trials where the test will be used to
guide patient care. Although it is not expected that exploratory studies using omics assays or
studies aiming to develop omics tests will meet all of the checklist criteria, the checklist
does provide a convenient framework by which to assess the stage of development of an
omics test and the strength and quality of the accumulated evidence. Several of the checklist
criteria (those that are not specific to the development of models from high-dimensional
data) also apply to studies of single biomarkers, or limited panels of biomarkers, measured
by a variety of conventional assay methods. The checklist may, therefore, serve as a useful
reference in a variety of review settings.
It is hoped that this 30-point checklist will guide investigators towards the use of best
practices in omics test development, help them to more reliably evaluate the quality of
evidence in support of omics tests, and assist them in planning appropriately for the clinical
use of omics predictors. The ultimate goal is to develop a more efficient, reliable and

BOX 1 Definition of ‘omics’

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In its report, Evolution of Translational Omics: Lessons Learned and the Path Forward,
the Institute of Medicine Committee on the Review of Omics-Based Tests for Predicting
Patient Outcomes in Clinical Trials defines ‘omics’ as the study of related sets of
biological molecules in a comprehensive fashion. Examples of omics disciplines include
genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and epigenomics. An omics-based
test is defined as “an assay composed of or derived from multiple molecular
measurements and interpreted by a fully specified computational model to produce a
clinically actionable result”1.
