ABSTRACT:
The polo-like kinase PLK2 has recently been identified as a potential theranostic
marker in the management of chemotherapy sensitive cancers. The methylation
status of the PLK2 CpG island varies with sensitivity to paclitaxel and platinum in
ovarian cancer cell lines. Importantly, extrapolation of these in vitro data to the
clinical setting confirms that the methylation status of the PLK2 CpG island predicts
outcomes in patients treated with carboplatin & paclitaxel chemotherapy. A second
cell cycle regulator, p57Kip2, is also subject to epigenetic silencing in carboplatin
resistance in vitro and in vivo, emphasising that cell cycle regulators are important
determinants of sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents and providing insights into the
phenomenon of collateral drug sensitivity in oncology. Understanding the mechanistic
basis and identification of robust biomarkers to predict collateral sensitivity may
inform optimal use of chemotherapy in patients receiving multiple lines of treatment.

INTRODUCTION

PLK2 IS EPIGENETICALLY REGULATED
IN HAEMATOLOGICAL NEOPLASIA

The Polo Like Kinases (Plk) are a family of
structurally similar but functionally (relatively) distinct
mitotic kinases all of which share homology with the
Drosophila Polo, mutants of which show defects in
mitosis and meiosis. There are five human Plk which have
critical roles in regulation of cell cycle and response to
DNA damage. Whilst there is good experimental evidence
that Plk1 may function as an oncogene and indeed is a
leading target for developmental therapeutics in oncology,
Plk2-Plk5 have properties more consistent with tumour
suppressor genes [review 1]. Plk2 was initially identified
as an early response gene in serum-starved cells rechallenged with serum, hence the original name Serum
Inducible Kinase (Snk) [2].. Later it was shown that the
gene is a transcriptional target of p53 and activates a
G2-M checkpoint [3].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We used suppression: subtraction PCR to identify
PLK2 as a gene down-regulated in B lymphomas [4].
Remarkably, Plk2 was subject to methylation-dependent
transcriptional silencing in 100% of Burkitt lymphoma
(BL) cell lines and a similarly high proportion of primary
BL. The CpG island was also methylated across the
spectrum of B cell lymphomas and in a proportion of
cases of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLL),
suggesting that the gene is frequently down-regulated in
B cell dyscrasias. More recent studies from our groups
have shown methylation in the PLK2 CpG island in other
haematological malignancies including multiple myeloma
[5], acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic
syndromes (MDS) [6]. We found that the frequency of
methylation was higher in MDS than in AML (88.4%

vs 68.9%) and also was significantly higher in low and
intermediate risk MDS compared to higher risk groups
(p=0.04). Based on these findings we suggested that
methylation of PLK2 could be another mechanism that
leads to increased apoptosis that characterizes early stage
MDS [6]. Another finding in this study was a tendency
for improved survival for both AML and MDS patients
who displayed hypermethylation of the PLK2 CpG island,
suggesting that the gene may have a utility as a prognostic
biomarker in myeloid malignancies. In multiple myeloma,
the frequency of aberrant methylation was found to be
60%, and although no correlation was found between
PLK2 methylation and MTHFR genotypes, anemia, bone
disease or advanced stage, a 48% lower risk of death was
noted for patients with methylated PLK2 CpG island [5].

The taxanes docetaxel and paclitaxel remain key

tumours, including breast cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer
(EOC), non-small cell lung cancer and prostate cancer.
Resistance to chemotherapy including to the taxanes
remains, however, one of the most important factors
limiting the ability of oncologists manage neoplastic
disease long term. Whereas a subset of human tumours
exhibit clinical hypersensitivity to chemotherapy [7], the
majority typically respond transiently to cytotoxic drugs
but ultimately acquire resistance leading to treatment

failure and death. The time interval between initial
response and clinical drug resistance varies widely. For
example, small cell lung cancer demonstrates remarkable
sensitivity to cisplatin and etoposide in the majority of
patients but relapse is inevitable and frequently occurs
within weeks of stopping chemotherapy. In EOC, the
majority of cases are initially sensitive to first-line
chemotherapy typically with carboplatin and paclitaxel,
but in contrast to small cell lung cancer sensitivity may be
retained for extended periods of time, with only gradual
emergence of drug-resistance. It is standard clinical
practice to re-challenge EOC patients with platinum-based
chemotherapy if a disease-free interval of > 1 year has
elapsed since previous exposure to platinum, but there
are few other clinico-pathological parameters to guide
the physician in the rational use of chemotherapy at first
and subsequent relapses, underlining the importance
of identifying and validating robust biomarkers of drug
sensitivity / resistance.
An increasing consensus recognizes the importance
of epigenetics (heritable non-structural changes in gene
expression), as a major mechanism driving acquired
resistance to chemotherapy [8]. A popular approach to
identifying determinants of acquired resistance to anticancer agents is the use of cell lines made relatively
resistant to cytotoxic drugs in vitro with subsequent
analysis either via the testing of candidate genes or by
expression profiling. We derived a series of novel EOC
cell lines with acquired resistance to paclitaxel and
carboplatin and showed that resistance to paclitaxel,
often with cross-resistance to carboplatin, occurred with
loss of the G2 checkpoint and apoptosis [9] and we asked
whether this was associated with changes in expression
of the Polo Like Kinases. Whereas expression of Plk1,
Plk3 and Plk4 was unchanged, there was clear and
reproducible down-regulation of Plk2 due to acquired
methylation in the CpG-island at the 5’ end of the gene.
Increasing levels of resistance to paclitaxel correlated with
incrementally decreased expression of Plk2 and increasing
CpG island methylation. We propose that exposure to
chemotherapeutic stress induces methylation in the CpG
island of specific “ resistance” genes and this seeding
effect leads to increasing methylation as the level of
resistance increases, a phenomenon previously described
in cells exposed to 6-mercaptopurine [10]. A study
by Matthew et al. [11] described an in vivo study that
considered the influence of hypoxia on chemosensitivity
in Plk2-deficient tumours. Complete resistance to
camptothecin was shown which pointed to an interplay
between Plk2 and tumour micro-environment, whereas
in the same experiments normoxia was associated with
increased drug sensitivity. In the same study, it was shown
that Plk2 can inhibit mTOR signaling under the influence
of wild-type p53 control.
In clinical cases of EOC, DNA methylation of the
CpG island in the PLK2 promoter in tumor tissue was
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

associated with a higher risk of relapse in patients treated
post-operatively with carboplatin and paclitaxel and this
trend was also reflected in the analysis of matched serum
samples in which detection of methylated PLK2 genomic
DNA was more frequent in relapsed cases [9], Figure
1A. Further, we were able to show in the same series that
for patients for whom methylated PLK2 was detected in
either or both tumour tissue and matched serum there was
reduced survival, shown by Kaplan-Meier analysis (Figure
1B and 1C). Independent evidence of an important role
for Plk2 as a determinant of chemotherapy sensitivity
was afforded by a micro-array study which identified
Plk2 as a down-regulated gene in chemotherapy-resistant
EOC [12]. Plk2 was also independently identified as a
critical determinant of clinical sensitivity of B CLL to
chemotherapy, failure of Plk2 induction by fludarabine
strongly predicting chemotherapy resistance [13].
Interestingly, when A2780 cells with high level resistance
to paclitaxel were grown in the absence of maintenance
exposure to the drug, a paclitaxel sensitive population
re-emerged which re-expressed Plk2 due to loss of
methylation in the PLK2 CpG island. These proliferated at
a higher basal rate than the paclitaxel-resistant cells from
which they derived, an effect phenol-copied (at least in
part) by ectopic expression of Plk2 [9] and unpublished
observations). This was to the best of our knowledge the
first demonstration that specific epigenetic changes are
reversible when the selective pressure that initiated and
then sustained evolution of a drug resistant cell population
is removed. Our observations may partially answer the
question of why the longer an individual cancer patient
is not exposed to anti-cancer agents, the higher the
probability that clinical response will be seen upon rechallenge with the original chemotherapy (a regular
management strategy in platinum sensitive EOC and in
other cancers treated with platinum such as non-small
cell and small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma). In this
model, methylation-dependent transcriptional silencing
of key cell cycle regulators would increase with ongoing
exposure to cytotoxic drugs and then diminish when
chemotherapy is stopped. Re-expression of genes such as
PLK2 and re-emergence of a more rapidly proliferating
cell population would manifest as clinical relapse but with
reacquired chemotherapy sensitivity.

A WIDER ROLE FOR CELL CYCLE
REGULATORS IN DRUG RESISTANCE IN
OVARIAN CANCER
We have demonstrated a role for down-regulation
of Plk2 as a pivotal factor underlying platinum /
taxane resistance in EOC by a series of gene silencing
experiments [9]. These findings prompt interesting
questions concerning a possible more general role for
cell cycle regulators as determinants of chemotherapy
sensitivity/ resistance, consistent with work by other
80

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 78 - 83

investigators [14]. Micro-array analysis of our own series
of novel paclitaxel- and platinum-resistant EOC cell lines
has revealed that several such genes are down-regulated in
isogenic paclitaxel-resistant cell lines, including Wee1 and
p57Kip2. Down-regulation of p57Kip2 results in unopposed
activity of the cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) and we
hypothesized that this could confer collateral sensitivity to
CDK inhibitors. Testing the CDK2 inhibitor seliciclib in
EOC cell lines confirmed that this is indeed the case [15].
These results raise the intriguing possibility that a subset
of EOC, in which acquired resistance to chemotherapy
occurs via transcriptional silencing of cell cycle regulatory
genes such as p57Kip2 are collaterally sensitized to
pharmacological inhibition of the CDKs.

to the Hsp90-targeting compound Geldanamycin [22]. The
same study showed a combination of Geldanamycin and
imatinib to be effective in BCR/Abl expressing cells, but
only at unrealistic dose levels. An intriguing approach
was to then consider the cell cycle inhibitor flavopiridol
– which can act as a transcriptional inhibitor (as can the
CDK inhibitor seliciclib) and could help to overcome
the block in apoptosis seen in highly over-expressing
BCR/Abl cells. Indeed, the triple combination of drugs
enabled sensitization of the resistant cells to the effects
of Geldanamycin [22]. Increased activation of AKT and /
or a lack of PTEN is associated with tumours with a high
proliferative response and chemotherapy resistance, but
may confer sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors (reviewed
in23]. This is further complicated by the fact that a
feedback loop in the mTOR pathway leads to suppression
of AKT and thus mTOR inhibition could actually lead to
activation of AKT in some cells [24]. The notch3, jagged
and Wnt genes have been shown to be expressed in serous
ovarian cancers [25]. It is tempting to speculate that this
tumour, which is notoriously chemorefractory, may be
sensitive to specific targeted agents directed against such
genotypes.
The EGFR directed tyrosine kinase inhibitor
Gefitinib, whilst showing itself to be an effective therapy
in the management of NSCLC with activating mutations
in EGFR, is also associated with the development of
resistance rendering it ineffective. NSCLC cell lines with
acquired resistance to Gefitinib expressing reduced EGFR
were shown to possess collateral sensitivity to TNF-alpha
[26]. Even with reduced EGFR levels, Gefitinib resistant
cells responded to TNF-alpha by autophosphorylation of
EGFR with reduced AKT-phosphorylation.
Our observations, and those of other investigators,
imply that a potential approach to therapy of solid
tumours would envisage molecular profiling pre- and
post-acquisition of clinical drug resistance. Transcriptional
silencing of one or more key cell cycle regulators such as
p57Kip2 would support the use of CDK inhibitors. Clearly,
such an approach requires additional studies to determine
the specific role of cell cycle regulators as determinants
of resistance to individual chemotherapeutic agents and
the effect of their loss, if any, in conferring collateral
sensitivity to pharmacological inhibitors of the CDKs.

COLLATERAL SENSITIVITY OF DRUG
RESISTANT CELL LINES – ARE THERE
OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESENSITISATION?
The term “ collateral sensitivity” was first used in the
field of microbiology to describe the “hypersensitivity” of
otherwise antibiotic resistant E.coli (reviewed in Hall et al.
2009). The mechanistic basis underlying this phenomenon
are varied and complex but nevertheless encompass a wide
range of important chemotherapeutic drugs (reviewed in
16]. The concept that acquired resistance to one class
of agent may confer “collateral sensitivity” to a second
class of agents is established in the field of oncology and
has been explored with a number of cytotoxic cancer
chemotherapeutic agents [17], but has not been widely
exploited in the clinical setting.. Interestingly, it was
shown that the collateral sensitivity of nitrogen mustardresistant cells to chloroethyl nitrosoureas was attributable
to the loss of guanine-O6-alkyl transferase activity present
in the parent line, implying that changes in expression
of specific genes confer both resistance and collateral
sensitivity [18]. A study by Nakajima et al. [19] which
examined two different time exposures of EOC lines to
paclitaxel demonstrated a relationship between drug
exposure time and extent of resistance induction, with
collateral sensitivity to cisplatin. Another study by Xu et
al. [20] analysed cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer lines
generated by use of varying concentrations of inducing
agent. Higher cisplatin-resistance was shown to correlate
with collateral sensitivity to other platinum compounds,
doxorubicin, mitomycin C and 5-FU. A variety of
mechanisms associated with antioxidant and transporter
genes was proposed by the authors [20]. There are also
examples of platinum-resistance being associated with
collateral sensitivity to anti-folate compounds [21].
Mechanistically, collateral sensitivity: resistance has
been more rigourously tested with new targeted anti-cancer
agents. Indeed, the literature cites a number of examples
where new targeted therapy may be used advantageously
in combination “cocktails”. Raf-1 transformed cells were
relatively resistant to doxorubicin but collaterally sensitive
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CONCLUSIONS
Since the first description of anticancer drug
resistance, investigators have identified a multiplicity
of mechanisms which affect cellular sensitivity both to
individual agents and more generally.
Alongside efforts to describe the mechanistic basis
of reduced response to chemotherapy, there is a continuing
requirement to identify robust biomarkers which predict
patients at risk of developing chemotherapy resistant
disease and suggest optimal alternative therapy for them.
