Abstract
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a pleiotropic bioactive lipid mediator that promotes breast cancer progression by diverse mechanisms that remain somewhat unclear. Here we report pharmacologic evidence of a
critical role for sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) in producing S1P and mediating tumor-induced hemangiogenesis
and lymphangiogenesis in a murine model of breast cancer metastasis. S1P levels increased both in the tumor and
the circulation. In agreement, serum S1P levels were signiﬁcantly elevated in stage IIIA human breast cancer
patients, compared with age/ethnicity-matched healthy volunteers. However, treatment with the speciﬁc SphK1
inhibitor SK1-I suppressed S1P levels, reduced metastases to lymph nodes and lungs, and decreased overall tumor
burden of our murine model. Both S1P and angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) stimulated hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in vitro, whereas SK1-I inhibited each process. We quantiﬁed both processes in vivo from the same
specimen by combining directed in vivo angiogenesis assays with ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting, thereby
conﬁrming the results obtained in vitro. Notably, SK1-I decreased both processes not only at the primary tumor
but also in lymph nodes, with peritumoral lymphatic vessel density reduced in SK1-I–treated animals. Taken
together, our ﬁndings show that SphK1-produced S1P is a crucial mediator of breast cancer–induced hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Our results implicate SphK1 along with S1P as therapeutic targets in breast
cancer. Cancer Res; 72(3); 726–35. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer
among women accounting for 30% of all new cancer cases,
and close to 40,000 breast cancer deaths are expected to occur
among U.S. women in 2011 (1). The majority of deaths of breast
cancer patients occur after it metastasizes and becomes a
systemic disease (2). To date, most systemic therapies, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, target the tumor itself and not the
host tumor microenvironment, which is known to play an
important role in the progression of cancer (3, 4).

It is well established that hemangiogenesis is one of the key
tumor microenvironmental factors in cancer progression.
Tumor growth beyond a diameter of a few millimeters requires
hemangiogenesis which contributes to the development of
metastatic disease (5, 6). Although hemangiogenesis is known
to be an acquired capability of cancer (7), results of multiple
randomized clinical trials that targeted hemangiogenesis using
bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (mAb), failed
to show an overall survival beneﬁt in breast cancer (8–10).
Breast cancer ﬁrst metastasizes to its sentinel lymph node,
and the level of lymph node metastasis is a major determinant
of staging and prognosis of breast cancer (2, 11). Recently,
lymphangiogenesis, a process that generates new lymphatic
vessels from preexisting ones, was found to be mediated by
several factors including VEGF-C, D, and angiopoietins (Ang1
and Ang2), which provided new insights into how the lymphatic vessels grow and affect metastasis (12, 13). Although
clinical and experimental evidence suggest a role for lymphangiogenesis in lymph node metastasis, this process is far less
understood than hemangiogenesis (13, 14).
The pleiotropic bioactive lipid mediator sphingosine-1phosphate (S1P) is now emerging as a key regulatory molecule
in cancer through its ability to promote cell proliferation,
migration, invasion, and hemangiogenesis (15, 16). S1P is generated intracellularly by 2 sphingosine kinases, sphingosine
kinase 1 (SphK1) and SphK2, and is exported out of the cells

S1P Promotes Hemangiogenesis and Lymphangiogenesis

where it regulates many functions by binding to and signaling
through a family of 5 G protein-coupled receptors (S1P1–5).
This process known as "inside-out" signaling explains the
autocrine and paracrine actions of S1P (15). We previously
showed that SphK1, but not SphK2, is involved in S1P export
from breast cancer cells mediated by the ATP-binding cassette
transporters, ABCC1 and ABCG2 (17). Expression of SphK1 is
upregulated in breast cancer (18, 19), correlates with poor
prognosis (20), and is associated with resistance to chemotherapy (18). Furthermore, abundant evidence implicates the
SphK1/S1P/S1P1 axis in hemangiogenesis and vasculogenesis
(21). In contrast, only a few studies so far have examined the
involvement of SphK1 and S1P in lymphangiogenesis. S1P has
been shown to induce in vitro lymphangiogenesis via the
S1P1 receptor (22), and it was recently reported that SphK1
and S1P in lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) are required for
the proper development of lymphatic vessels (23). However,
nothing is yet known of the role of SphK1 and S1P in tumorinduced lymphangiogenesis in vivo.
In this study, we utilized an improved syngeneic breast
cancer cell implantation method, which models human breast
cancer biology better than conventional xenograft subcutaneous implantation, to explore the role of SphK1 and S1P in
hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. We found not only
that circulating S1P levels correlated with tumor burden but
also that targeting SphK1 with a speciﬁc inhibitor reduced
tumor growth, lymph node and lung metastasis, and decreased
hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis around the primary
tumor and in the lymph nodes. Our results suggest that
targeting SphK1 and S1P may be a useful additional modality
for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
4T1-luc2 cells, a mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cell
line that has been engineered to express luciferase (PerkinElmer), were cultured in RPMI Medium 1640 with 10% FBS.
Green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)-expressing human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and GFP-expressing human
lymphatic endothelial cells (HLEC) purchased from AngioProteomie were maintained in endothelial cell medium supplemented with 5% FBS and endothelial cell growth supplement (ScienCell Research Laboratories).
Construction of lentiviral shRNAs for mouse SphK1
Three sense sequences of siRNA cassettes speciﬁcally targeting the nucleotides of mouse SphK1 (accession number:
NM_011451.1) were designed using siRNA Target Finder
(Ambion). The speciﬁcity of the selected sequences was conﬁrmed by BLAST search. The lentiviral short hairpin RNAs
(shRNA) were constructed using a pLL3.7 expression vector as
described previously (24). The sequences of the shRNAs for
mouse SphK1 are as follows: shRNA 1, 50 - GCACCCAAACTACCTTTGGAT-30 ; shRNA 2, 50 - GCACCTTCTTTCGCCTAGCAA-30 ; shRNA 3, 50 -GAGGCAGAGATAACCTTTAAA-30 .
Recombinant lentivirus was produced by cotransfection of
293FT cells with lentiviral vector and the packaging vectors

using calcium phosphate. The viruses were collected from the
culture medium and puriﬁed by polyethylene glycol precipitation. The transduction efﬁciency of lentivirus in 4T1 cells was
determined by ﬂuorescence microscopy. The silencing efﬁciency was determined using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and
Western blot analysis.
Syngeneic tumor model
All animal studies were conducted in the Animal Research
Core Facility at VCU School of Medicine in accordance with the
institutional guidelines. All procedures were approved by the
VCU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
that is accredited by the Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). Female
BALB/c mice, 8 to 12 weeks of age, weighing approximately 20 g
were obtained from Harlan. 4T1-luc2 cells (1  105 cells in 10
mL RPMI) were surgically implanted in the upper fat pad under
direct vision. One day after implantation, mice were randomized by tumor size determined by bioluminescence with the
IVIS Imaging System (Xenogen). SK1-I in PBS was injected
intraperitoneally, as indicated, every day at a dose of 20 mg/kg.
At the indicated times, the animals were sacriﬁced by exsanguination, blood was collected, tumors excised, weighed, ﬁxed
in formalin, and embedded in parafﬁn or frozen in liquid
nitrogen.
Bioluminescent quantiﬁcation of tumor burden
D-Luciferin (0.2 mL of 15 mg/mL stock; PerkinElmer) was
injected intraperitoneally into mice previously implanted with
4T1-luc2 cells. Living Image Software (Xenogen) was used to
quantify the photons/sec emitted by the cells. Bioluminescence was measured and quantiﬁed at 5-minute intervals over
30 minutes using a subject height of 1.5 cm, medium binning
and an exposure time of 0.5 seconds to 1 minutes. Bioluminescence was then determined by the peak number of
photons/sec calculated over this time frame. Axillary lymph
node metastasis was quantiﬁed in vivo after intraperitoneal
injection of luciferin and primary tumor resection. Lung
metastasis was quantiﬁed ex vivo after the lungs were removed.
Quantiﬁcation of sphingolipids by mass spectrometry
Lipids were extracted from serum and tissues and sphingolipids quantiﬁed by liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS; 4000
QTRAP, AB Sciex) as described (25).
Directed in vivo angiogenesis assays and cell isolation
Angioreactors [directed in vivo angiogenesis assays (DIVAA)
kit; Trevigen] were implanted into the subcutaneous layer of
the back of 8-week-old nude mice under anesthesia according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Mice were euthanized with
CO2 at day 11 after implantation and the angioreactors were
removed under stereomicroscopy (SZ51, Olympus).
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
Single-cell suspensions were obtained from lymph nodes as
described (26). For DIVAA/FACS (ﬂuorescence-activated cell
sorting) analyses, Matrigel and ﬁbrotic reactive tissue in the

Histopathologic analysis and vessel density
determination
Immediately after the sacriﬁce of the animals, tumor samples were ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for immunohistochemical analyses of cell proliferation and apoptosis.
4T1-luc2 cell proliferation in the tumor was determined by
staining histologic sections with mAbs against Ki67 (Dako), a
nuclear protein expressed in proliferating cells. Apoptosis was
determined by terminal uridine deoxynucleotidyl transferase
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay using the ApopTag
Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit S7100 (Millipore).
The tumors were also embedded in optimal cutting medium (OCT 4583; Sakura Finetek) and frozen for immunoﬂuorescent analysis for hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.
The sections were stained with the following antibodies as
indicated: CD31 (BD), LYVE-1 (Abcam) and F4/80 (kindly

were examined with LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscopes (Zeiss) and microvessel density was determined as
previously described (28).
Patient samples
All studies using patient samples were conducted in accordance with the institutional guidelines after approval by VCU
Institutional Review Board. Human sera were collected by the
Tissue and Data Acquisition and Analysis Core of VCU and S1P

and each experimental group consisted of at least 6 mice.

Results
Upregulation of SphK1 and increased S1P levels in 4T1luc2 tumor progression
Previous studies showed that S1P and SphK1, the enzyme
that produces it, regulate many processes important for breast
cancer (15). To examine their involvement in breast cancer
progression in vivo, we utilized an enhanced syngeneic mouse
metastatic breast cancer model in which 4T1-luc2 murine
mammary cancer cells were orthotopically implanted under
direct vision into the chest mammary fat pad of immunecompetent mice. We have found that this chest orthotopic
model more accurately mimics human breast cancer progression than subcutaneous models. Indeed, 4T1-luc2 cells produced large tumors in the chest mammary fat pad that rapidly
metastasized and increased total tumor burden (Fig. 1A).
Metastatic spread to the regional axillary lymph nodes and
the lungs was quantiﬁed by bioluminescence after removal of
the 4T1-luc2 tumors from the implantation sites (primary
tumors). As can be seen in Fig. 1B, lymph node metastases
emerged earlier than lung metastases, with a rapid increase in

the incidence of metastasis to the lymph nodes, similar to
human breast cancer progression.
Expressions of both SphK1 and SphK2 were very low in naive
mammary fat pads, whereas 4T1-luc2 cells express much
higher levels of SphK1 mRNA than SphK2 (Fig. 1C). However,
after implantation in mammary fat pads, SphK1 mRNA levels
in breast tumors were signiﬁcantly increased (Fig. 1C), with
concomitantly increased S1P levels in the tumors (Fig. 2E).
Interestingly, levels of S1P in serum from these mice were also
signiﬁcantly elevated (Fig. 1D), suggesting that overexpression
of SphK1 in the tumors may be responsible for the increased
circulating S1P.
Because it has been shown that overexpression of SphK1
correlates with poor prognosis of breast cancer patients (20),
it was of interest to measure serum levels of S1P in breast
cancer patients. We found that the serum S1P levels were
signiﬁcantly elevated in stage IIIA breast cancer patients who
have lymph node metastases, compared with age/ethnicitymatched healthy volunteers (Fig. 1E).
Growth of primary mammary tumors, tumor burden,

We next examined the effect of inhibition of SphK1 with
SK1-I [(2R,3S,4E)-N-methyl-5-(4-pentylphenyl)-2-aminopent4-ene-1,3-diol (BML-258); ref. 30]. SKI-I is a potent, water-

730

Cancer Res; 72(3) February 1, 2012

soluble, isoenzyme-speciﬁc inhibitor of SphK1 that in contrast
to pan-SphK inhibitors does not inhibit SphK2, protein kinase
C, or numerous other protein kinases (30). Consistent with
previous studies in other types of cancer cells (30, 31), SK1-I
inhibited growth of 4T1-luc2 cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2A). A signiﬁcant effect was observed at a concentration of
3 mmol/L and complete inhibition of growth at 10 mmol/L (Fig.
2A). We conﬁrmed that SK1-I decreased the enzyme activity of
SphK1 and that downregulation of SphK1 with speciﬁc siRNA,
similar to SK1-I, also suppressed the growth of these cells (data
not shown). We ﬁrst examined circulating levels of SK1-I
following a single intraperitoneal injection of 20 mg/kg. Plasma
SK1-I levels reached a maximum concentration of 0.6 mmol/L
within 2 hours but still could be detected up to 12 hours.
Concomitantly, plasma levels of S1P were signiﬁcantly reduced
up to 12 hours (Supplementary Fig. S1). We then investigated
the effect of SK1-I on the growth of 4T1-luc2 tumors in mouse
mammary fat pads. Intraperitoneal injections of SK1-I significantly reduced both tumor volume and weight (Fig. 2B and C).
The tumors from animals treated with SK1-I also showed
reduced mitotic activity compared with those from vehicletreated animals, as shown by Ki67 immunohistochemistry (Fig.
2D). Conversely, TUNEL staining revealed a large increase in
apoptotic cells in tumors from SK1-I–treated mice (Fig. 2D).
Consistent with the upregulation of SphK1 in tumors (Fig. 1C),
S1P levels in tumors gradually increased compared with naive

or SK1-I (10 mmol/L), as indicated. A, representative images. B, two random ﬁelds per well were photographed. Total tube length determined and

or sham operated mammary fat pads as measured by LC-ESIMS/MS. This increase of S1P in the tumors was prevented by
treatment with SK1-I (Fig. 2E). Notably, SK1-I was taken up by
the mammary tumors and its levels gradually increased with
time (Fig. 2F).
The total tumor burden determined by the IVIS Imaging
System was also signiﬁcantly suppressed by SK1-I treatment (Fig. 3A). Serum S1P levels, which are elevated in the
tumor-bearing mice, were also reduced by SK1-I treatment
(Fig. 3B). Serum levels of SK1-I in these mice increased with
time (Fig. 3C). Importantly, SK1-I signiﬁcantly reduced
lymph node and lung metastasis (Fig. 3D and E). Taken
together, these results suggested that S1P produced by
SphK1 in the mammary tumors is involved in lymph node
and lung metastasis.
SK1-I suppresses in vitro hemangiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis
Because hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis are considered to play critical roles in lymph node and lung metastasis
(28), it was of interest to next examine the role of S1P generated

www.aacrjournals.org

by SphK1 in these processes. We ﬁrst determined the effect of
S1P on in vitro hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. In
agreement with previous studies (22, 32), we found that S1P is a
potent hemangiogenic and lymphangiogenic factor for human
blood and lymphatic endothelial cells, respectively, as shown
by enhanced tube formation (Fig. 4A and B). This reﬂects cell
migration and organization of a network architecture, key
aspects of both hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.
Ang2, whose levels in breast cancer correlate with metastasis
to lymph nodes and poor prognosis (33), was used as a positive
control. SK1-I inhibited in vitro hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (Fig. 4A and B), suggesting that the effects of
Ang2 are mediated at least in part by SphK1 and formation of
S1P.
We next sought to determine whether high expression of
SphK1 and S1P production in 4T1-luc2 cells contribute to
enhanced lymphangiogenesis and hemangiogenesis. Whereas
supernatants from 4T1-luc2 cells signiﬁcantly stimulated tube
formation of HUVECs and HLECs, shRNA knockdown of

S2E). Moreover, treatment with S1P did not affect expression of
either VEGF-A or VEGF-C mRNA in 4T1-luc2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results indicated that S1P produced by
SphK1 in 4T1-luc2 mammary cancer cells is an important
contributor to hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.

Involvement of SphK1 and S1P in in vivo
hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis
DIVAA provides a simple and quantitative method to measure hemangiogenesis in vivo (34). In contrast, one of the
challenges of studying lymphangiogenesis in vivo is the lack
of assays for objective quantiﬁcation (12). To this end, we
developed a similar approach to simultaneously quantify both
hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis by combining
DIVAA with FACS (DIVAA/FACS).
We initially modiﬁed the FACS gating scheme established by
Pham and colleagues (23) to separate lymph node blood
endothelial cells (BEC) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC)
from other cells. TER-119 and CD45 were used to gate out red
blood cells (RBC) and leukocytes, respectively (Fig. 5A). LECs
and BECs were quantiﬁed using gp38 (podoplanin) and lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-1), speciﬁc markers for LECs, and CD31, a speciﬁc marker for both
BECs and LECs. LECs were identiﬁed as CD45CD31þgp38þ,
BECs as CD45CD31þgp38, and ﬁbroblast reticular cells
(FRC) as CD45CD31gp38þ. As expected, the selected population of LECs showed a higher expression of LYVE-1 than
BECs or FRCs (Fig. 5B).
In the DIVAA approach, mice were implanted subcutaneously with silicone cylinders (angioreactors) that were closed
at one end and ﬁlled with 20 mL of Matrigel (34). The addition of
stimuli enables directional migration of BECs and LECs into
the angioreactors, which proliferate and form appropriate
vessels. In agreement with previous studies (34), hemangiogenesis was readily observable by the appearance of blood
vessels (Fig. 5C). Both S1P and Ang2 signiﬁcantly induced
hemangiogenesis 11 days after implantation of the angioreactors (Fig. 5C). To simultaneously quantify hemangiogenesis
and lymphangiogenesis, cells were isolated from the angioreactors by collagenase digestion, followed by FACS analysis to
separate the BECs from LECs and other cells as described
above. Interestingly, both S1P and Ang2 enhanced the migration of BECs and LECs into the angioreactors, although
hemangiogenesis was more pronounced than lymphangiogenesis (Fig. 5D and E). Similar to its effect on in vitro hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (Fig. 4B), the inclusion of SK1-I
in the angioreactors together with Ang2 completely abolished
its ability to stimulate both of these processes (Fig. 5E).
Inhibition of SphK1 suppresses hemangiogenesis and
lymphangiogenesis in tumors and in lymph nodes in vivo
To establish that S1P generated by SphK1 plays a critical role
in tumor-induced hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in
vivo, we next examined the effect of SK1-I on hemangiogenesis
and lymphangiogenesis in the tumors themselves and in the
draining lymph nodes. FACS analysis of mammary pad site
tumors revealed that both BECs and LECs were greatly reduced
by treatment of mice with SK1-I (Fig. 6A and B). Interestingly,
the number of BECs and LECs in lymph nodes, the host tumor
microenvironment, was signiﬁcantly increased in tumor-bearing animals compared with sham animals, and treatment with
SK1-I inhibited the increase of both BECs and LECs in lymph
nodes (Fig. 6C and D). Morphometric analysis conﬁrmed that
SK1-I reduced both tumor-induced hemangiogenesis and

Figure 6. Inhibition of SphK1 suppresses hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in tumors and lymph nodes in vivo. 4T1-luc2 cells implanted in
chest mammary fat pads were allowed to form tumors for 2 days, which were quantiﬁed by IVIS. Mice with similar amounts of tumor were randomized
and treated with either PBS or SK1-I (20 mg/kg/d i.p.). Tumors (A, B) and regional axillary lymph nodes (C, D) were harvested after 4 days of treatment,
minced, digested with collagenase, and BECs and LECs quantiﬁed by FACS. Total numbers of BECs or LECs in 4T1 tumors (B) and lymph nodes (D) are

Discussion
Previous studies have shown that SphK1 is overexpressed in
breast cancer, and its level of expression correlates with
resistance to treatments and poor patient outcomes
(16, 18, 20). However, several factors have hindered progress
in determining the role of S1P, the product of SphK1, in
tumorigenesis and tumor-induced hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in vivo. First, because S1P has such a profound

www.aacrjournals.org

role in immune function (35), studies of traditional in vivo
metastatic breast cancer models with xenografts in immunecompromised mice that ignore the host immune response to
cancer may be difﬁcult to interpret. Second, it has not been
possible to accurately quantify S1P in tumors until recently
with the development of high sensitivity mass spectrometric
assays (25). To this end, we utilized our newly established
syngeneic breast cancer model, which not only retains the host
immune responses but also more closely models progression of
the human disease by forming lymph node and lung metastasis
leading to metastatic spread and death. Our data indicate that
SphK1 is the predominant isoenzyme expressed in 4T1-luc2
cells in culture dish, and is further upregulated in tumors, in

contrast to SphK2. This is in agreement with previous reports
correlating expression of SphK1, but not of SphK2, with poor
prognosis in breast cancer (20). We found that levels of S1P
gradually increased both in tumors and in serum determined
by LC-ESI-MS/MS and correlated with tumor burden. Moreover, treatment of tumor-bearing animals with the speciﬁc
SphK1 inhibitor SK1-I reduced S1P levels in the tumor and in
circulation, and greatly reduced the size of the primary tumor,
lymph node, and lung metastasis. This is in agreement with a
previous report that blood and tumor S1P levels were increased
in mice with colon cancer (36).
Quantiﬁcation of tumor-induced hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis has remained a challenge (12). This is usually
examined by histologic determinations of microvessel density
or LVD, which rely on selective morphometric analysis (e.g.,
vessel counts, vascular morphology, etc.; ref. 12). The strengths
of the morphologic approach are that it can evaluate the
location of the vessels in relationship to the tumor and
identify/quantify morphologic changes that lymphatic vessels
undergo during tumor progression. The limitations include
variable sites of tissue sectioning, variable immunostaining
techniques, different vessel density quantiﬁcation methods,
and the lack of standardization in the estimation of hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (12). To compliment this
approach and overcome some of these limitations, we developed a ﬂow cytometry method to quantify both BECs and LECs
in the same sample, to simultaneously evaluate both hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Flow cytometric analysis
can provide supportive data to quantify the changes in BECs
and LECs.
Consistent with both the in vitro tube formation and DIVAA/
FACS assays, we showed that exogenous S1P enhanced hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. In this regard, Anelli and
colleagues showed that downregulation of SphK1 did not
change the levels of VEGF-A or VEGF-C secretion in glioma
cells, and downregulation of SphK1, but not VEGF-A or VEGFC, suppressed glioma-induced hemangiogenesis (37). Utilizing
shSphK1, we conﬁrmed that tumor-derived S1P mediates
tumor-induced hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis
without altering VEGF-A or VEGF-C (Supplementary Fig.
S3), which is in agreement with Anelli and colleagues (37).
Taken together, S1P is an important stimulator of hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in vitro.

SK1-I decreased hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis
not only around the primary tumor but also in lymph nodes
that are distant from the tumor. Furthermore, we have
observed by F4/80 immunoﬂuorescent staining that SK1-I
also reduced macrophage recruitment surrounding the tumor
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Macrophages are cellular components of the tumor microenvironment that promote hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis (38, 39). Thus, in addition to
direct effects on hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, S1P
can indirectly affect the tumor microenvironment to further
enhance these processes.
In sum, S1P generated by SphK1 is important not only for
tumor progression but also for tumor-induced hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and, therefore, targeting SphK1
and its product S1P would be a multipronged attack against
breast cancer.
