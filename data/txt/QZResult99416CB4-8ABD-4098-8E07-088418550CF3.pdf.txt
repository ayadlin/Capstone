Escherichia coli-derived L-asparaginase. Six of 104 patients developed severe AAP.
One patient was treated with intravenous infusion of protease inhibitor, and
48 hours of the onset of AAP.

RESULTS. The patient who received intravenous protease inhibitor had pseudocyst
formation and developed a subsequent leukemic recurrence after the interruption
of chemotherapy for 4.5 months. In the other patients, AAP subsided within 2 to
6 days after the start of CRAI, and serious complications did not emerge. Significantly, chemotherapy could be resumed within 4 weeks (range, 12-23 days)
after the onset of AAP, and the patients were in complete remission from 4 months
to 44 months with further chemotherapy that excluded L-asparaginase.

CONCLUSIONS. The current results indicated that early introduction of CRAI of
protease inhibitor and antibiotic is suitable for treating severe AAP. Cancer

-asparaginase is a key drug in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL),1 and
it has been demonstrated recently that intensified protocols that
include L-asparaginase provide favorable outcomes for not only
children2 but also for adolescent and adult patients.3,4 However,
pancreatitis is a serious adverse effect of L-asparaginase, and the
incidence of severe L-asparaginase–associated pancreatitis (AAP)
reportedly ranges from 0.6% to 6.7%.2,5-10 How AAP develops
remains unknown, and we cannot yet predict which patients will
develop AAP after treatment with L-asparaginase.7
The standard treatment for childhood ALL is remission induction therapy with vincristine, a corticosteroid, L-asparaginase, and

an anthracycline.11 However, some patients may develop severe AAP in the neutropenic phase, and this
is accompanied with potentially fatal complications,
such as organ dysfunction, hemorrhage, sepsis, and
pseudocyst formation.12 In such patients, chemotherapy must be interrupted, which elevates the risk of
an ALL/LBL recurrence. This situation would be
improved greatly by the development of an effective
treatment for severe AAP that swiftly resolves it and
prevents the development of fatal complications.
This also would permit the rapid resumption of
chemotherapy. However, such a treatment has not
been developed to date.
It recently was reported from Japan that continuous regional arterial infusion (CRAI) of both protease
inhibitor and antibiotic is an effective treatment for
acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP), because it
reduces mortality and prevents the development of
pancreatic infection in adult patients, especially
when it is initiated within 48 hours of the onset of
ANP.13-16 Consequently, the Japanese Guidelines now
recommend that patients with ANP may be treated
with CRAI of protease inhibitor and antibiotic as an
optional measure.17 We investigated whether this
therapy also may be useful for pediatric patients
with ALL and LBL who develop severe AAP.
In this report, we describe 5 pediatric patients
with severe AAP who were treated successfully
by CRAI of protease inhibitor and antibiotic. The
rapid resolution of AAP led to the swift resumption
of chemotherapy within 4 weeks of the onset of
AAP. The patients remained in complete remission
(CR) with further chemotherapy that excluded Lasparaginase.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between 2000 and 2007, 104 pediatric patients with
ALL/LBL (aged <18 years) were treated in our
affiliated hospitals with intensive regimens, mainly
the Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine protocol,18 which included L-asparaginase (Escherichia
coli-derived asparaginase; produced by Kyowa Hakko,
Tokyo, Japan). Twelve of the 104 patients developed
AAP, which was diagnosed on the basis of clinical
data and enhanced computed tomography (E-CT)
findings. The severity of AAP was quantified within
48 hours of its onset by calculating the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE
II)19 and Japan Ministry of Health and Welfare
(JMHW)20 scores. E-CT findings were graded according to Balthazar21 and JMHW22 criteria. AAP was
considered ‘severe’ when the Balthazar CT severity
index was 4 and/or when the JMHW E-CT grade

1363

was IV (characterized as diffuse, uneven density in
the pancreatic parenchyma or inflammatory changes
or fluid collection that extend away from the pancreas) or grade V (characterized as diffuse, uneven
density in the pancreatic parenchyma and extrapancreatic inflammation or fluid collection beyond the
pancreatic area).
Immediately after AAP was diagnosed, the
patients received an intravenous infusion of protease
inhibitors (gabexate mesilate, 1 mg/kg per hour; ulinastatin, 10,000 U/kg per day; octreotide acetate,
20 lg/kg per day) and broad-spectrum antibiotics
with aggressive hydration. Patients were not allowed
to eat or drink and were maintained by total parenteral nutrition. Patients with mild AAP recovered with
this conservative management strategy. In addition,
all but 1 patient with severe AAP received CRAI of
protease inhibitor and antibiotic within 48 hours of
the onset of AAP after written informed consent was
obtained from their guardians. After celiac and
superior mesenteric arteriography was performed to
delineate the precise anatomy of the relevant area, a
polyurethane-coated catheter with a tapered tip was
inserted (the outer dimensions of the proximal and
distal shafts were 5 French and 2.7 French, respectively; Anthron P-U catheter; Toray Medical, Tokyo,
Japan). The tip of the catheter was placed at a point
where the bloodstream best irrigated the pancreas.
In some patients, the tip of the catheter was positioned at 1 of the branches arising from the celiac artery, and a side hole opening into the celiac artery
was created. This allowed the infused drugs to be
distributed throughout the entire pancreas. The protease inhibitor nafamostat mesilate (50 mg in 20 mL
of 5% glucose) was infused at a rate of 0.2 mg/kg per
hour for 22 hours a day, and the antibiotic imipenem
was infused at 12-hour intervals at a dose of
12.5 mg/kg delivered over 1 hour.

RESULTS
Six of the 12 patients with AAP were diagnosed with
severe AAP. The characteristics and clinical findings
of these patients are shown in Tables 1 and 2. These
patients ranged in age from 2 years to 9 years. Four
patients had B-precursor ALL (Patients 1 and 3-6),
and the remaining patient had T-cell LBL (Patient 2).
Three patients each developed AAP in the induction
(Patients 2, 4, and 5) and consolidation (Patients 1, 3
and 6) phases of treatment for their underlying disease. The chemotherapy at the time AAP developed
consisted of a combination of L-asparaginase, vincristine, and prednisolone with or without pirarubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and/or cytarabine

(Fig. 1). The APACHE II and JMHW scores calculated
within 48 hours of the onset of AAP in the 6 patients
ranged between 23 and 28 and between 8 and 12,
respectively. The 3 patients who developed AAP in
the induction phase of therapy for their underlying
disease (Patients 3, 5, and 6) had remarkable leukopenia (range, 300-700 cells/lL) with agranulocytosis.
Three patients (Patients 2-4) had oligouria because
of hypovolemia despite vigorous fluid therapy. E-CT
evaluation of the patients led to Balthazar CT severity
index scores of 8 (Patients 1 and 3), 10 (Patient 2),
and 4 (Patients 4-6) and JMHW CT grades of V
(Patient 1) and IV (Patients 2-6), all indicating severe
AAP. The maximal levels of serum C-reactive protein
(CRP) were >15 mg/dL for Patients 2, 3, and 6;
>10 mg/dL for Patients 4 and 5; and >6 mg/dL for
Patient 1 (Fig. 2a).
The first patient with severe AAP (Patient 1), who
was treated conservatively with intravenous infusion
of protease inhibitors, had persistent severe abdominal pain and high serum levels of amylase and CRP
associated with pseudocyst formation (Fig. 2). Severe
AAP subsided after drainage of the pancreatic pseudocyst; however, leukemic recurrence occurred during the interruption of chemotherapy for 4.5 months

(at 7 months after diagnosis of leukemia) (Table 3).
The other 5 patients with severe AAP received CRAI
of protease inhibitor and antibiotic 6 to 36 hours after the onset of AAP. The tip of the catheter was
placed in the superior mesenteric artery in Patient 2,
the gastroduodenal artery in Patients 3 and 5, the
splenic artery in Patient 4, and the left infraphrenic
artery in Patient 6. In Patients 3, 4, and 6, a side hole
was opened into the celiac artery. The duration of
CRAI was from 2 days to 6 days. Within 48 hours of
starting CRAI, 4 patients reported resolution of the
severe abdominal pain that required administration
of opiates. The other patient (Patient 3) continued to
report pain until Day 6. This patient also had a brief
resurgence of CRP levels after CRAI was completed
(on Day 10) (Fig. 2a). However, within 2 weeks of
starting CRAI, the serum CRP and amylase levels of
all patients had normalized (Fig. 2). Moreover, 3 of
the 5 patients could resume feeding within 3 weeks
of starting CRAI (Patients 2, 5, and 6), and a fourth
patient started feeding on Day 30 (Patient 3). The
remaining patient, Patient 4, developed a small pancreatic pseudocyst (<2 cm in greatest dimension)
and did not resume feeding until Day 88. The pseudocyst regressed spontaneously within 6 months

(Patients 3 and 4) were given enteral nutrition
through a nasojejunal tube. None of the patients
developed an infection, even the 3 patients who
demonstrated agranulocytosis. All patients could resume chemotherapy (excluding L-asparaginase) from
11 days to 22 days after the onset of AAP (Fig. 1).
One patient (Patient 6), after restarting feeding and
chemotherapy, showed mild reactivation of AAP on
Day 19 (APACHE II score, 14; JMHW score, 5; Balthazar CT severity index score, 4 at reactivation). How-

ever, this attack was resolved within 10 days by
fasting and intravenous infusion of protease inhibitors. These 5 patients remained in CR with further
chemotherapy that excluded L-asparaginase from
4 months to 44 months after the onset or recurrence
of underlying disease (3 patients in first CR and
2 patients in second CR) (Table 3).

Months after the onset or relapse of underlying disease.

Medicine recommend that patients with severe acute
pancreatitis who have APACHE II and/or JMHW
scores that exceed 13 and 8, respectively, should be
transferred to an intensive care unit and monitored
for complications, such as infection and pseudocyst
development. These guidelines also recommend considering optional therapies such as CRAI.23 The mortality rates of patients with APACHE II scores >8 and
JMHW scores from 2 to 8 and from 9 to 14 are
30%,24 11%, and 29%,20 respectively. Patients with
high serum CRP values (>15 mg/dL) and CT severity
indices >6 also have significantly high mortality rates
compared with patients without these markers (42%
vs 7% and 57% vs 13%, respectively).24 The patients
described in this report had exceedingly high
APACHE II and JMHW scores that ranged from 23 to
28 and from 8 to 12, respectively. Moreover, 3 of
6 patients had CRP values >15 mg/dL, and 3 patients
had CT severity index scores >6. These findings suggest that our 6 patients had very severe AAP.
Patients who develop AAP have poor outcomes.
Knoderer et al reported that patients with ALL who
developed pancreatitis were less likely to remain
alive in remission than patients who did not develop
pancreatitis (58% vs 79%).7 This is exemplified by
our literature survey of patients with severe AAP
(Table 4),7,25-35 which demonstrated that 2 of 6
patients who developed AAP in the induction phase
of treatment for ALL died because they could not
resume chemotherapy. In 10 patients who had information available on the resumption of chemotherapy, no patient was able to resume chemotherapy
within 30 days after the onset of AAP. Moreover, all
but 1 of 25 patients (96%) in the literature had complications of AAP, in particular, the development of
pancreatic pseudocysts. Indeed, our first patient
(Patient 1), who was treated conservatively, had leu-

kemic recurrence with prolonged interruption of
chemotherapy (>4 months) because of a developing
pancreatic pseudocyst. Sepsis that leads to multiple
organ failure is another serious, potentially fatal
complication in patients with severe pancreatitis.12
Three of 25 patients (12%) in the literature developed
peritonitis or sepsis (Table 4). However, none of our
5 patients who received CRAI early after the onset of
AAP developed an infection. This was true even for
the 3 patients who developed AAP in the induction
phase of treatment and exhibited agranulocytosis.
Consequently, they were able to resume chemotherapy within 4 weeks of the onset of AAP. Although
1 patient had mild reactivation of pancreatitis when
feeding was resumed and another patient developed
a small pancreatic pseudocyst, these problems were
resolved with conservative treatment that did not
require a prolonged interruption of chemotherapy. At
the time of this writing, all 5 patients were alive
in CR.
Protease inhibitors are expected to be effective
against acute pancreatitis, because they have broad
inhibitory actions on serine proteases, the coagulation system, the complement system, and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, the
clinical efficacy of intravenous infusion of protease
inhibitors is still under debate, although successful
reports of CRAI of protease inhibitor and antibiotic
in preventing the exacerbation of severe acute pancreatitis have been accumulating.36 In our series, the
1 patient who received only an intravenous infusion
of protease inhibitor had a poor clinical course,
whereas the other 5 patients who received CRAI had
favorable outcomes. This may be explained by the
concentration of protease inhibitors in pancreatic tissue, which was not sufficient when these inhibitors
were administrated intravenously because of their

AAP indicates L-asparaginase–associated pancreatitis; CR, complete remission; ND, not described.

pharmacokinetic characteristics and impaired microcirculation in the pancreas. It has been demonstrated
that intra-arterial infusion generates up to 32-fold
grater protease inhibitor levels in pancreatic specimens than intravenous infusion.37 It has been
reported that CRAI of both protease inhibitor (nafamostat) and antibiotic (imipenem) quickly and effectively in relieved pancreatitis-induced pain, prevented pancreatic infections, and reduced mortality
in patients with acute severe pancreatitis and/or
ANP.13,15,16 In addition, it was reported that the early
initiation of CRAI, especially within 48 hours of the
onset of ANP, was important for reducing mortality.14
It should be noted, however, that all of these successful reports of CRAI related to adult patients from
Japan; and, to our knowledge, the efficacy of early
CRAI in children with pancreatitis has not been
reported to date. This may reflect a common belief
that it is difficult and dangerous to insert an angiocatheter into the pancreas in children. However,
we had no difficulty, even with our patient aged only
2 years (body weight, 13 kg), in inserting an angiocatheter with a tapered tip. Moreover, thrombosis,
blood flow insufficiency, and bleeding of the catheter-inserted femoral artery never were detected.
In conclusion, our experience suggests that the
early treatment of pediatric patients with severe AAP
who otherwise would have a poor prognosis by CRAI
of protease inhibitor and antibiotic is not only feasible, it also effectively prevents the development of

complications of AAP. Consequently result, these
patients can rapidly resume chemotherapy, which
improves their outcome with regard to their underlying malignant disease.
