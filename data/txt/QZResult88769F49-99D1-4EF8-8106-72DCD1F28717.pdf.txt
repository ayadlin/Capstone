BACKGROUND: Aberrant DNA methylation is a hallmark of cancer, and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors have demonstrated clinical efficacy in hematologic malignancies. On the basis of preclinical studies indicating that hypomethylating agents can reverse platinum resistance in ovarian cancer cells, the authors conducted a phase 1 trial of lowdose decitabine combined with carboplatin in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. METHODS:
Decitabine was administered intravenously daily for 5 days, before carboplatin (area under the curve, 5) on Day 8 of
a 28-day cycle. By using a standard 3 þ 3 dose escalation, decitabine was tested at 2 dose levels: 10 mg/m2
(7 patients) or 20 mg/m2 (3 patients). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and plasma collected on Days
1 (pretreatment), 5, 8, and 15 were used to assess global (LINE-1 repetitive element) and gene-specific DNA methylation. RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at the 20-mg/m2 dose was grade 4 neutropenia (2 patients), and no DLTs
were observed at 10 mg/m2. The most common toxicities were nausea, allergic reactions, neutropenia, fatigue, anorexia, vomiting, and abdominal pain, the majority being grades 1-2. One complete response was observed, and 3 additional patients had stable disease for 6 months. LINE-1 hypomethylation on Days 8 and 15 was detected in DNA
from PBMCs. Of 5 ovarian cancer-associated methylated genes, HOXA11 and BRCA1 were demethylated in plasma on
Days 8 and 15. CONCLUSIONS: Repetitive low-dose decitabine is tolerated when combined with carboplatin in
ovarian cancer patients, and demonstrates biological (ie, DNA-hypomethylating) activity, justifying further testing for

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy1 with a 5-year survival rate below 25%

for patients diagnosed with stage III-IV.1,2 Most advanced stage patients respond to cytoreductive surgery and platinumbased chemotherapy; however, >70% of women relapse, and platinum-resistant EOC is uniformly fatal.3,4
Similar to other malignancies, the progression of ovarian cancer is positively correlated with accumulation of aberrant gene promoter DNA cytosine methylation.5-7 As promoter DNA methylation is intimately associated with transcriptional gene silencing, this epigenetic modification can substitute for genomic lesions (eg, deletions or mutations) in
providing the first or second inactivating hit to tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs).8 In EOC, promoter DNA methylationassociated silencing is frequently detected for TSGs such as RASSF1A, BRCA1, DAPK, OPCML, and hSulf-1, and for

development-associated transcription factors HOXA10
and HOXA11.7,9-11 Correspondingly, DNA hypomethylating agents can restore gene expression of TSGs silenced
by promoter DNA methylation. Hypomethylating agents
have demonstrated clinical activity for the treatment of
hematologic malignancies, particularly myelodysplastic
syndromes.8,12-14
Several preclinical studies of ovarian and other cancers have indicated that hypomethylating agents, including the deoxycytidine analog decitabine, can reverse
platinum resistance in chemoresistant cancer cell lines and
mouse-engrafted tumors.11,15-18 This chemosensitization
is hypothesized to be because of the derepression of TSGs
that were previously silenced by promoter DNA methylation, resulting in restored TSG gene expression and the
reestablishment of chemotherapy drug response cascades.11,15,16,19 Consequently, few clinical studies have
examined combinations of DNA methylation inhibitors,
such as decitabine (5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine), with conventional chemotherapies, including platinum-based
drugs.20-23 Several preclinical and clinical studies in hematologic cancers have shown that although decitabine
(and other DNA methylation inhibitors) is cytotoxic at
high doses, lower, nontoxic doses more effectively induce
DNA hypomethylation and gene re-expression.12,13
Because of the difficulty of obtaining tumor samples
from cancer patients at relapse, there has been an increasing interest in the development of predictive plasma or serum markers.24 In particular, using a highly sensitive
fluorimetric (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-based)
assay,25 specific methylated DNA sequences (believed to
be shed by membrane-ruptured tumor cells) can be
detected in the plasma of cancer patients.26 These plasmaassociated DNA methylation biomarkers correlate well
with disease stage and therapy response, representing a
promising diagnostic/prognostic tool.9,26,27 In ovarian
cancer in particular, several plasma-methylated genes have
demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for disease
detection and/or prognosis, including BRCA1, RASSF1A,
and SFRP.9,27
In this report, we describe results of a phase 1 trial
testing repetitive, low-dose decitabine, in combination
with carboplatin, in patients with recurrent, platinumresistant EOC. We show that this regimen is well tolerated and exhibits biological activity in vivo, as evidenced
by global (in peripheral blood cells) and gene-specific (in
plasma) DNA hypomethylation, thus establishing a basis
for its further investigation in a phase 2 study now
underway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population
Patients with advanced, histologically documented EOC
or primary peritoneal carcinomatosis who progressed during or recurred within 6 months after platinum-based
chemotherapy were eligible. Eligibility included both
measurable and detectable disease. Measurable disease was
defined according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST).28 Patients with nonmeasurable
disease could enroll if they had clinically or radiologically
detectable disease and a pretreatment serum CA 125 level
at least twice the upper limit of normal. All patients were
at least 18 years old with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1 and life expectancy of at least 3 months. Eligibility criteria allowed an
unlimited number of prior cytotoxic therapies, and
required adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function. Key exclusion criteria included prior history of allergic reaction to carboplatin, history of brain metastases,
grade 2 or higher neuropathy, or ongoing uncontrolled
medical problems. All patients signed written informed
consent, and the protocol was approved by the Indiana
University Institutional Review Board.
Treatment Plan
Treatment consisted of escalating doses of decitabine
(Eisai, Tokyo, Japan) given as an intravenous (IV) infusion daily for 5 days, and carboplatin (Bristol Meyers
Squibb, New York, NY) administered IV on Day 8 at a
dose delivering an area under the curve of 5. Decitabine
was escalated from 10 mg/m2 (dose level 1) to 20 mg/m2
(dose level 2), using the standard 3 þ 3 dose escalation.29
The rationale for this dose schedule was based on previous
trials in hematologic cancers demonstrating biological
activity in this dose range.12,13
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any
occurrence during the first 4 weeks of therapy of grade 4
thrombocytopenia, grade 3 or 4 neutropenic fever, grade
4 neutropenia lasting >5 days, grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity, or failure to recover blood counts by Day
42. Each cycle was 4 weeks, and treatment was continued
until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Growth
factor support was not permitted during Cycle 1, and
intrapatient dose escalation was not allowed.
Efficacy and Toxicity Assessments
Adverse events were assessed on Day 1 of each cycle and
graded according to National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.

When possible, tumor burden was evaluated by clinical
examination at baseline and before each cycle. Alternatively, tumor burden was evaluated radiographically at
baseline, before each odd cycle, when clinically indicated,
and at the end of treatment. Investigator-determined best
overall response was defined using RECIST 1.0 criteria
for patients with measurable tumors. CA 125 measurements were obtained from all patients on Day 1 of each
cycle, and modified Rustin criteria were to be used to
assess response for patients with detectable disease.30
Blood and/or Ascites Collection
Samples of whole blood (20 mL) were collected in 2 10mL ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tubes. After mixing,
samples were centrifuged (1500  g at 4 C for 15
minutes) to separate the plasma from the blood cell layers.
Plasma and buffy coats were securely stored at 80 C
until use. For the first 2 cycles, blood samples were collected at baseline (pretreatment), on Day 5 (after the last
day of decitabine infusion), on Day 8 (before carboplatin
infusion), and on Day 15 (to assess DNA methylation).
To examine time-dependent DNA demethylation, methylation levels of blood collected on Days 5, 8, and 15 were
compared with baseline levels (Day 1). When available
and accessible, ascites fluid or tumor material obtained
through core biopsies under radiographic guidance were
collected on Days 1 (pretreatment) and 8 (before carboplatin infusion).
DNA Extraction and Methylation Analysis
DNA was extracted from 200 lL of buffy coat, 1 mL of
plasma, or 200 lL ascites using a QIAmp DNA Blood
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the column elution repassaged through the column 4 to increase DNA yield.
Universal methylated human reference DNA was purchased from Zymo Research (Orange, Calif). Sodium

bisulfite conversion of genomic DNA and cleanup were
performed using an EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo
Research), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After bisulfite conversion (unmethylated cytosine deamination to uracil), the treated DNA was analyzed by
MethyLight, a highly sensitive, quantitative methylationspecific PCR technique,25 using the primers and probes
listed in Table 1. In addition to the primers and probe sets
designed for each gene of interest, triplicate assessments of
an internal reference PCR product (using primers and
probes to a consensus CpG-devoid region of an ALU repetitive element, ALU-C4) were used to normalize for
input DNA.25 DNA methylation levels of LINE-1 repetitive elements were expressed as percentages of fully methylated reference molecules, determined by dividing the
GENE:ALU-C4 ratio (ie, using ALU-C4 as the reference
product) of the experimental sample by the GENE:ALUC4 ratio of universally methylated human DNA (Zymo
Research), and multiplying by 100.25,31
Statistical analysis

This was an open-label, single-center phase 1 study
conducted to determine the safety and the biologic activity of the decitabine/carboplatin combination. The primary objectives were to determine the safety and
tolerability of decitabine administered IV daily for 5 days
before carboplatin. The secondary objective was to measure the biologic activity by evaluating hypomethylation
of target sequences. Demographic and baseline characteristics were summarized using medians (with ranges) for
continuous variables, and counts and proportions for categorical variables. Toxicity of the regimen was assessed by
the frequency/percentage and severity of reported AEs. To
account for the correlation of measurements from the
same subject, levels of global or gene-specific methylation
were analyzed by linear random-effects models. Factors
included in the model were days, dose level, cycle number,

and subject. If these factors were statistically significant,
we included 2-way interaction terms. Marginal effects
were estimated by averaging over other factors. Correlations between different methylation levels were evaluated
by Pearson correlation coefficient. A P value of .05 was
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Patients

Ten consenting patients were enrolled in cohorts of
3, with 9 patients completing at least 1 cycle of therapy.
Two dose levels were used: dose level 1 (10 mg/m2) and 2
(20 mg/m2), and the escalation followed a standard 3 þ 3
design.29 One patient enrolled at dose level 1 deteriorated
rapidly because of progressive disease and received only
part of the first treatment cycle. Therefore, this patient
was only partly evaluable for assessment of toxicity and
was replaced. As 2 DLTs were recorded among 3 patients
treated at dose level 2, an expanded cohort of 3 additional
patients was open for dose level 1, to assess tolerability of
the regimen, before proceeding to the phase 2 trial.
Table 2 indicates that all patients had measurable
and platinum-resistant recurrent EOC or primary peritoneal carcinomatosis. The median age was 62.5 years
(range, 51-71 years). Nine (90%) patients had EOC, and
1 (10%) had primary peritoneal carcinomatosis. Serous
papillary carcinoma was the most common histology (9
[90%] patients). This was a heavily pretreated group of
patients who had received a median of 5 prior regimens
(range, 2-9).
Treatment administration and safety

Among all patients, 38 cycles were administered.
Seven patients were treated at dose level 1, including an
expansion cohort, and 3 patients at dose level 2. The median number of cycles completed was 2.5 (range, 1-9þ).
Causes for treatment discontinuation were: progressive
disease (3 patients), withdrawal of consent (1 patient),
death (1 patient died of gastrointestinal obstruction while
on treatment; the attribution to treatment was considered
highly unlikely), and other causes (1 patient because of
events unrelated to treatment). Two patients are still
receiving treatment.

The most common AEs were nausea (80%), allergic reactions (60%), neutropenia (70%), fatigue (50%), anorexia

patients had stable disease as their best response. Interestingly, the patient with complete response initially had stable disease, and developed a partial response after Cycle 6
and a complete response at Cycle 8. At 6 months, 4 (40%)
patients were without disease progression. With a median
follow-up of 8.5 months, 7 patients are alive, of whom 2

Pharmacodynamic activity of decitabine, as
assessed by DNA hypomethylation

To evaluate the biological activity of the decitabinebased regimen, we assessed its hypomethylating activity in
vivo. As a surrogate marker for decitabine biological activity, we assessed post-treatment changes in global (ie, genome-wide) DNA methylation levels in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), using a highly sensitive and
fully quantitative methylation-specific PCR assay, MethyLight.25 DNA was isolated from buffy coats and sodium
bisulfite-treated to deaminate unmethylated cytosine to
uracil. Global DNA methylation levels were assessed by
MethyLight assay of LINE-1 (long-interspersed) repetitive elements, which accurately estimates total genomic
DNA methylation.25 As shown in Figure 2 (A, B), LINE1 methylation levels of all patients analyzed demonstrated
reduced global methylation on Days 8 and 15, as compared with Day 1. In particular, methylation levels on
Day 8 were significantly lower than on Day 1 for Cycle 2,
as compared with Day 8 of Cycle 1 (P ¼ .04). The reduction pattern was different (P ¼ .005) between the 2 cycles,
partially because of the increase of methylation level at
Day 5 for Cycle 1 (P ¼ .04) that was not observed for
Cycle 2. No dose effect was observed (P ¼ .36, data not
shown).
Second, to assess possible tumor response-associated
changes in DNA methylation, we performed MethyLight

Consequently, we examined 5 genes demonstrated as
highly or moderately frequently methylated in ovarian
cancer,7,9,11 including the tumor suppressors BRCA1,
RASSF1A, and WWOX, and the development-associated
homeobox genes HOXA10 and HOXA11, recently shown
to be highly discriminatory between ovarian cancer and
normal tissue.10 Similar to global (repetitive element)
DNA methylation levels, demethylation of BRCA1 was
more pronounced on Days 8 and 15 compared with Day
1 (Fig. 2C, D) and in patients treated at dose level 2 (data

not shown). Of a total of 5 ovarian cancer-associated
methylated genes (BRCA1, RASSFA1, WWOX, HOXA10,
and HOXA11),7,9-11 HOXA11 was found to be significantly (P < .001) demethylated on Day 15, as compared
with Day 1 (not shown), and demonstrated a trend toward demethylation at Day 5 (P ¼ .07). We noted that of
the 5 genes, plasma HOXA11 methylation level significantly and strongly correlated with LINE-1 DNA methylation in PBMCs (Fig 2E).
In addition to the composite (ie, multiple patient)
methylation responses shown in Figure 2, we also
observed, on an individual level, correlations in trends of
hypomethylation between plasma and PBMCs. As shown
in Figure 3, Patient 1 demonstrated similar decreases in
methylation of LINE-1 (PBMCs) and BRCA1 and
RASSF1A (plasma).
Similar analyses were performed in ascites fluid or
tumor biopsies obtained from 2 patients. Ascites was collected from 1 patient (Patient 3). Figure 4 shows a high

degree of both global (LINE-1) and gene-specific

hypomethylation in ascites fluid, as compared with baseline, with similar trends as observed in PBMC and plasma
DNA (Fig. 4A-C). Decitabine activity was also measured
directly in tumor tissue obtained by core biopsies on Day
1 and Day 8 from 1 patient (Patient 5). We observed
LINE-1 and gene-specific hypomethylation (HOXA10,
HOXA11, and WWOX) occurring in response to decitabine in tumor tissue (Fig. 5D). Correspondingly, we
observed demethylation of HOXA10 and HOXA11 (but
not WWOX) after decitabine treatment in this patient’s
plasma, suggesting at least a partial correlation between
methylation levels in tumor and peripheral blood (Fig.
5A-C).

daily for 5 consecutive days before carboplatin in patients
with recurrent platinum-resistant EOC. On the basis of
preclinical studies in various malignancies, including
ovarian cancer,15,16,18,33 we hypothesized that administering decitabine could resensitize chemoresistant tumors to
carboplatin. One complete response was recorded, and 4
of 10 enrolled patients were free of disease progression at
6 months, indicating clinical activity in platinum-resistant
EOC and supporting further investigation in a phase 2
setting.
Toxicities observed in this trial were mild, consisting
mostly of nausea, fatigue, and neutropenia. Grade 4 neutropenia in 2 patients represented the DLT at the 20-mg/
m2 dose level. More pronounced rates of myelosuppression were recorded in previous trials examining decitabine-based combinations in lung cancer21 and cervical
cancer22 in regimens using bolus decitabine administration. In a phase 1 trial, carboplatin was given with decitabine in patients with solid tumors.23 The schedule of
administration was decitabine given as a 6-hour infusion
on Day 1 and carboplatin given as an IV bolus on Day 8.
The DLT was myelosuppression, and the maximum toler-

ated dose of decitabine was 90 mg/m2. However, further
exploration of this regimen in a phase 2 trial revealed a
high incidence of neutropenia, leading to decitabine dose
de-escalation to 45 mg/m2 and subsequent termination of
the trial.34 In contrast, in our trial, administration of low
repetitive doses of decitabine was well tolerated.
Interestingly, we observed a high incidence (60%) of
carboplatin hypersensitivity reactions. All allergic events
responded to administration of steroids and antihistamines, and subsequent treatment with carboplatin was
possible using slower rates of infusion and steroid premedication.35 Given the small number of patients, it is difficult to conclude that decitabine increases the risk of
hypersensitivity to carboplatin; however, the rate of allergic reactions observed here appeared higher than previously reported.36,37
Both dose levels tested were biologically active, as
assessed by DNA hypomethylation in PBMCs and
plasma, as well as in tumor material and ascites collected
from 2 patients (Figs. 4 and 5). In PBMCs, a significant
reduction in global methylation (LINE-1 repetitive elements) was observed on Days 8 and 15 (Fig. 2). The

In addition to DNA from PBMCs, we also assessed

specificity and sensitivity in prostate cancer,38 prognostic

DNA originates from necrotic tumor cells, and paired tumor-plasma samples have demonstrated a moderate
degree of correlation.32,40 Of 5 ovarian cancer-linked
methylated genes examined (BRCA1, RASSF1, WWOX,
HOXA10, and HOXA11), HOXA11 and BRCA1 were significantly demethylated on Days 8 and 15, as compared
with Day 1 (not shown), and BRCA1 hypomethylation
was more pronounced during Cycle 2 than during Cycle
1. Significant demethylation of RASSF1 was recorded in 8
of 9 patients (data not shown). Moreover, hypomethylation of both global DNA and gene-specific DNA from
selected patients’ ascites and tumor biopsies exhibited

4050

trends similar to those seen in PBMCs and plasma (Figs. 4
and 5).
These results demonstrate that low-dose decitabine
is biologically active up to 10 days after its administration,
and DNA hypomethylation can be assessed in PBMCs
and plasma. Although in past trials, DNA hypomethylation has not been directly correlated with disease
response,12,13 a recent study of chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia suggests that hypomethylation may actually precede response, as measured by tumor cell clearance.41
Consequently, it is plausible that antineoplastic activity
may follow decitabine-mediated DNA hypomethylation
in EOC, and that these plasma-methylated genes represent candidate epigenetic biomarkers for the bioactivity of
this agent. The only patient who experienced a complete
response during this study developed unique and substantial demethylation of LINE1, BRCA1, and RASSFI from
Cycle 1 to Cycle 2. Although this observation needs confirmation in other patients, perhaps during the phase 2
study, it points to the possibility that the degree of DNA
hypomethylation correlates with clinical response.
To address our hypothesis of decitabine-mediated
platinum sensitization, we examined plasma methylation

of hMLH1, a specific gene encoding a mismatch repair
enzyme involved in the apoptotic response to platinuminduced DNA damage. However, hMLH1 methylation
was not detected in plasma (data not shown), in accordance with results of other studies demonstrating little or
no hMLH1 methylation in ovarian carcinomas.42-44 For
instance, in 1 study only 7.7% of stage IV ovarian tumors
possessed MLH1 methylation,42 and loss of MLH1 was
recorded only rarely in recurrent ovarian carcinomas.44
Although the use of DNA hypomethylating agents
for platinum resensitization is well supported by preclinical studies,15,16,33 we are aware of only 1 recent and 2 earlier trials in solid tumors. In the more recent study,
decitabine was administered as a bolus on Day 1, before
carboplatin. This regimen induced hypomethylation in
vivo, as assessed by fetal globin re-expression and demethylation of the MAGE1A gene promoter in PBMCs, buccal cells, and tumor biopsies.23 At the 90-mg/m2 dose, 1
patient experienced a partial response (after 8 cycles), and
1 had stable disease lasting over 6 cycles.23 A commentary
of that trial speculated that the decitabine dosing could be
optimized, based on the reproducible success of repetitive
low-dose decitabine administration in hematologic malig-

nancies,45 which is accomplished in the trial presented
here. Two other trials tested the decitabine/cisplatin combination in nonsmall cell lung cancer21 and in advanced
cervical cancer.22 Both trials used bolus decitabine administration for 3 days immediately preceding cisplatin infusion. No responses were observed in the lung cancer
study, and clinical activity observed in the cervical cancer
study could be attributed solely to cisplatin, as patients enrolled were chemotherapy naive. As decitabine-induced
hypomethylation requires several cell divisions before the
activation of chemotherapy response genes,14,46,47 we
speculate that a time delay between the administration of
decitabine and of the chemotherapeutic agent might have
resulted in greater tumor cell DNA hypomethylation and
consequently enhanced antitumor efficacy. The design of
the regimen tested in the current study was based on these
prior observations.
As platinum is the most active agent used against
ovarian cancer, a prognosis of end-stage disease is almost
always associated with platinum-resistant tumor relapse.1
Chemotherapy resistance in general, including resistance
to platinum drugs, is believed to be associated with
several cellular characteristics that permit survival from

therapeutic insults.11,19,48,49 The recent, prospective identification of tumor progenitors (cancer stem or cancer-initiating cells) has been reported for several solid tumors,
including EOC.50,51 These progenitors are hypothesized
to be largely (or entirely) responsible for chemoresistant
tumor relapse, because of the finding that normal stem
cells possess many of the phenotypes associated with drug
resistance (eg, enhanced DNA repair, diminished apoptotic responses).48,51 Moreover similarly to normal embryonic or tissue stem cells, cancer stem cells are believed to
harbor a significantly altered epigenome, and it has been
hypothesized that DNA hypomethylating agents could
reset these cells toward differentiation.8 Indeed, several
hypomethylating agents were originally characterized as
inducers of cancer cell differentiation,47 and 2 of these
(including decitabine) are now approved for the therapy
of myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.52 It therefore seems reasonable to speculate that hypomethylating agents, in combination with
chemotherapeutics, may target drug-resistant EOC initiating cells, possibly leading to tumor eradication.
Based on the above results, we conclude that lowdose decitabine can be safely and effectively combined
with carboplatin in ovarian cancer patients and demonstrates biological activity in vivo, as assessed by
decreased methylation of genome-wide repetitive elements and of ovarian cancer-associated genes. The 1
complete response and the prolonged disease stability in
3 additional patients are very encouraging, especially
considering that this is a selected group of patients with
highly chemorefractory tumors. In our now-ongoing
phase 2 study, we will determine the clinical efficacy of
this regimen in patients with platinum-resistant or -refractory EOC, the primary study endpoint being
response rate. Importantly, in that study, clinical benefit
will be correlated with DNA methylation changes in
PBMC, plasma, and tumor tissue (gene-specific methylation). In summary, based on the results of this work,
we believe that hypomethylating agents, in combination
with conventional or targeted therapies, represent
promising means of reversing chemotherapy resistance
in EOC patients.
