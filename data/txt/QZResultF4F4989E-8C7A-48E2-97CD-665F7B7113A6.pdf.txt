BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to confirm whether black and white women with endometrial cancer
are equally tolerant of chemotherapy and identify factors that impact survival. METHODS: A retrospective review of
169 black women and 982 white women with the International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians stage
III, stage IV, or recurrent endometrial carcinoma was performed. All patients received doxorubicin combined with cisplatin. Chemotherapy parameters that were reviewed included relative dose, relative time, and relative dose intensity.
Treatment cycles 7 were defined as treatment completion. RESULTS: Although black patients were more likely to
experience grades 3-4 anemia (20% vs 14%) and genitourinary (5% vs 1%) toxicity, and less likely to experience severe
gastrointestinal toxicity (10% vs 17%), the overall incidence of grades 3-4 treatment-related chemotoxicity was the
same between the 2 groups (82% vs 82%). There were no differences in the number of cycles received, relative dose
(0.57 vs 0.58), relative time (0.77 vs 0.78), or relative dose intensity (0.76 vs 0.76) for black and white patients. CONCLUSIONS: Black patients with advanced stage or recurrent endometrial cancer, treated on 4 Gynecologic Oncology
Group (GOG) protocols, had similar dose intensity and severe chemotherapy-related toxicity compared with white

KEYWORDS: endometrial cancer, chemotherapy, GOG.

In the United States, approximately 39,000 women will
be diagnosed with endometrial cancer and over 7400
deaths will be attributable to this disease.1 Although the
incidence of endometrial cancer is 30% lower among
black women compared with white women, mortality
among Blacks with endometrial cancer is 60% higher.2
The underlying cause of this racial disparity in endometrial cancer outcome among black patients with endometrial cancer is felt to be multifactorial.3-5 Populationbased studies have suggested that inequalities in treatment
may contribute to poor survival observed among black
women with endometrial cancer.6-8 In an effort to further
evaluate the racial disparity in endometrial cancer using a
clinical setting in which patients received similar care, our
group evaluated data from 4 clinical trials performed by
the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG).9 This analysis
showed that black patients had a 26% greater chance of
mortality compared with Whites, controlling for performance status, stage, histology, grade, and treatment.
The overall response to platinum-based and adriamycinbased chemotherapy for Blacks was 35% compared with
43% for Whites (P < .016). Although the proportion of
black and white patients completing the prescribed therapy (46% vs 42%) as well as the proportion of treatment
related deaths (1.9% vs 1.6%) was similar, data regarding
the dose intensity and duration of chemotherapy or treatment related toxicities was not evaluated.9 The purpose of
the current study was to further evaluate these chemotherapy parameters to determine whether black patients are
treated less aggressively with adjuvant chemotherapy compared with Whites and whether any differences in dosing
parameters affect survival outcome. Racial differences in
chemotherapy response and ultimately in survival among
endometrial cancer patients would suggest that a biologic
etiology may be, in part, associated with the poor outcome
observed among black women with advanced stage or
recurrent endometrial cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We reviewed patient data from participants in 4 GOG
randomized treatment trials for International Federation

356

of Gynecologic Oncology (FIGO) stage III, stage IV, or
recurrent endometrial cancer7: GOG Protocols 107, 139,
163, and 177.10-13 All treatment study arms of the individual protocols were included. All eligible patients had histologically confirmed endometrial cancer with measurable
disease and a GOG performance status (PS) of 0 to 2. Prior
radiation or hormone therapy, but not prior chemotherapy, was allowed. The treatment regimen for each trial is
listed in Table 1. Further details regarding eligibility, treatment, and outcomes have been published previously.10-13
Data on patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and
course of treatment were collected. Racial designation as
black or white reflected a nonuniform collection of both
self-described and investigator-reported methods. Patients
from other racial groups were excluded from this analysis
secondary to too few numbers for analysis.
Several characteristics of chemotherapy were evaluated in relation to race and outcome. Treatment parameters were defined according to Griggs et al, in their study
of breast cancer.16 Relative dose was the ratio of actual:
expected dose of chemotherapy in standard chemotherapy
regimens. This was calculated for each drug in the chemotherapy. Relative time was defined as the ratio of actual:
expected duration of chemotherapy. Relative dose intensity (relative dose intensity) was defined as the ratio of relative dose to relative time. We defined patient completing
at least 7 cycles as treatment completion because this was
the maximal numbers cycles involving doxorubicin (Adriamycin) received in 3 of the 4 GOG studies included in
our analysis and was based solely on precedent at the time
of protocol development.13 The relative time was calculated only for up to 7 cycles (prescribed by protocol) and
the expected duration of time on chemotherapy was 21
(ie, chemotherapy every 3 weeks)  7 (ie, total cycles)
days. The expected dose was the standard dose required
by protocol  7 (Table 1). Although the protocols
required dose adjustment for old age, prior relative time,
or body surface area (BSA) > 2, these adjustments were
treated as dose reductions. The average relative dose or relative dose intensity calculated based on combination regimens was used as a summarized parameter of the
combined regimen, with a ratio <1.0 indicating patient
receiving less intensity of chemotherapy than planned.

Statistical Analysis
The mean relative dose, relative time, and relative dose intensity between Blacks and Whites were compared using
Student t test. The number of treatment cycles, cause of
treatment incompletion, and toxicity were compared by
Pearson chi-square or Fisher exact test. The factors associated with treatment incompletion were identified using a
logistic regression model. The association of relative dose,
relative time, or relative dose intensity with survival was
estimated using a Cox regression model, adjusted for
established prognostic factors (performance status, stage,
tumor grade, histology, prior hysterectomy, type of chemotherapy, and race). The interaction between race and
treatment parameters was also assessed. The KaplanMeier procedure was used to estimate the cumulative
probability of survival. Because patients with disease were
more likely to drop the chemotherapy, resulting in dose
reduction, and to avoid the possible ‘‘outcome to cause
bias’’ or ‘‘outcome by outcome analysis’’, the survival analysis based on treatment parameters was restricted to
patients who completed all 7 cycles of chemotherapy, and
the survival was recalculated as the time from the completion of chemotherapy until death, regardless of causes. All
statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis System software (SAS version 9.1; SAS Inc., Cary,
NC).

RESULTS
A total of 982 white women and 169 black women with
FIGO stage III, IV, or recurrent endometrial cancer were
assigned to receive doxorubicin and cisplatin chemotherapy (Table 1). Clinical characteristics of this cohort of

patients have previously been published.9 Blacks were
more likely to have advanced stage disease (P < .001),
poorly differentiated tumors (P < .001), papillary serous
histology (P  .001), and poor performance status (P ¼
.008) compared with Whites. After adjusting for clinical
and treatment factors, black patients were at an increased
risk for death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.06-1.51; P ¼ .010).9
Dose Intensity
There were no differences in treatment parameters
between black and white patients (Table 2). The relative
dose was similar for the 2 populations (0.56 and 0.58,
respectively), as was relative time (0.77 and 0.78, respectively) and relative dose intensity (0.76 and 0.76, respectively). Forty-five percent of Whites completed at least 7
cycles of chemotherapy compared with 40% among
Blacks. The majority of patients who did not complete
therapy stopped therapy because of disease progression
(55% for Whites vs 53% for Blacks). Similar proportions,
29% of black patients and 22.3% of white patients, discontinued therapy because of toxicity. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with abnormal performance
status (P < .001), nonendometrioid cell type (P < .001),
or recurrent disease (P < .001) were less likely to complete
the treatment cycles required by protocol (Table 3). But,
black patients had the same likelihood of completing the
treatment as white patients (P > .05).
Toxicity
For selected common toxicity criteria categories, more
grades 3-4 anemia (20.1% vs 14.2%, P ¼ .05) and severe
genitourinary toxicity (4.7% vs 1.4%, P ¼ .009) and less

severe gastrointestinal toxicity (10.1% vs 16.7%, P ¼ .03)
were observed among black patients compared with white
patients (Table 4). There is also a suggestion that Blacks
experienced less leukopenia (55.6% vs 61.6%; P ¼ .14)
than Whites. However, there was no difference for overall
severe adverse effects involving Whites and Blacks when
considering any grades 3-4 toxicity event that occurred
during participation in these clinical trials (82.3% vs
82.1%; P ¼ .96) (Table 4). These results were consistent
from multivariate analysis adjusted for age, performance
status, body mass index, and prior radiotherapy,
The median relative dose, relative time, and relative
dose intensity were 0.83, 1.05 and 0.75, respectively, for
patients who completed at least 7 cycles of chemotherapy.
When analysis was restricted to this population, relative
dose in this restricted population appeared to be associated with survival, whereas both relative time and relative
dose intensity were not. On the basis of current data, every
10% increase of relative dose is associated with a 9%
reduction in the risk of death (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.840.99). Figure 1 presents the survival from the completion

of chemotherapy stratified by relative dose for the group.
For patients with relative dose 0.9, the median survival
was estimated to be 19.2 months compared with 13.6
months for those with relative dose <0.9 (log-rank test,
P ¼ .02). The association of relative dose with survival
was not modified by race (P > .05 for test of interaction).

DISCUSSION
In our assessment of chemotherapy parameters and potential racial disparities in treatment of patients with
advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, we evaluated
both the treatment-related toxicity and dose intensity of
therapy. Toxicity related to chemotherapy may be an
underlying cause for dose adjustments in some patients
and, if different among certain minorities, could account
for observed differences in cancer outcome. Dose intensity, the amount of drug delivered per unit of time, is an
important predictor of outcome in adjuvant chemotherapy for cancer,14 which can be increased by either using
higher doses of chemotherapy (relative dose) or shortening the interval between cycles (relative time).15 In a
MedLine search of the terms ‘‘endometrial cancer’’ and
‘‘chemotherapy’’, we did not find any previous reports
of these chemotherapy parameters in relation to endometrial cancer, particularly not in the context of racial
disparities.
Race was not a predictive factor for early discontinuation of chemotherapy among the patients evaluated. We
previously reported that 46.2% of Blacks and 42.2% of

Whites completed the required number of cycles (P ¼
.37).9 In our current analysis, we established that the majority of patients had discontinuation of chemotherapy
because of disease progression, which was similar between
black and white patients (55.2% and 52.5%, respectively). The second most frequent reason for shortening of
therapy in Blacks and Whites was treatment related toxicity that prompted protocol-related changes in chemotherapy administration (22.3 vs 28.7%, respectively). The
remaining patients in each of the 2 groups had chemotherapy stopped because of poor performance status, a
proportion that was similar in the 2 groups.
Blacks experienced a slightly increased incidence of
severe (any grade 3 or 4) anemia and severe genitourinary
toxicity and a lower frequency of leukopenia and severe
gastrointestinal toxicity than white patients receiving
chemotherapy. This increased incidence of anemia could
be related to a generally higher incidence of baseline anemia found in the black population.5 Nonetheless, we
found no evidence that these severe clinical toxicities
accounted for any difference in relative dose or relative
dose intensity among white and black patients. Overall,
82% of both black and white patients experienced any
grade 3 or 4 toxicity while on chemotherapy.
We identified 3 factors associated with discontinuation of chemotherapy in advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer patients when other clinical factors were
evaluated using regression analysis. Patients with performance status >0 (P < .001), recurrent disease (P < .001),
and nonendometrioid histology (P < .001) were all less
likely to complete the number of cycles of intravenous
chemotherapy required by each of the protocols. When
analysis was restricted to patients who successfully com-

pleted 7 cycles of chemotherapy or women who received
fewer cycles secondary to toxicity issues, relative dose, relative time, and relative dose intensity were all similar
between Blacks and Whites.
Although there are no previous reports in endometrial cancer for comparison, Griggs et al16 found systematic differences in the administration of chemotherapy
given to black women with breast cancer. Blacks received
lower relative dose (0.80 vs 0.85, P ¼ .03) and relative
dose intensity (0.76 vs 0.80, P ¼ .01) than Whites. The
authors speculated that these differences in chemotherapy
administration could potentially contribute to racial disparities in breast cancer survival.16 Although differences
in chemotherapy administration could possibly be a contributor to racial disparities in endometrial cancer outcome on a population basis, our data revealed that racial
disparities in survival can persist even when black and
white women receive chemotherapy similarly in clinical
trial setting.
In our analysis, we found that almost half of the
patients enrolled on these protocols were not able to
maintain the dosage prescribed (ie, relative dose 0.56 for
Blacks and 0.58 for Whites). The main reasons for dose
adjustment were progression, toxicity, and poor performance status, which were equivalent among Blacks and
Whites. For those patients able to maintain dosage, every
10% increase in relative dose was associated with a 9%
reduction in the risk of death.
Previous investigations involving racial disparities in
chemotherapy toxicity are limited, particularly in regards
to gynecologic cancer. In a study of another disease site,
black patients with stage II and stage III colon cancer
experienced less overall (defined as toxicity events  grade

1) gastrointestinal treatment-related toxicity (ie, diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis) compared with
Whites.17 The only racial difference in severe toxicity
observed was specifically for diarrhea, with 23% of Whites
experiencing severe diarrhea compared with 8% of Blacks.
The clinical relevance of this discrepancy in overall toxicity can be scrutinized, however, as the 2 groups derived
similar benefits from the adjuvant chemotherapy administered. Significantly lower rates of gastrointestinal toxicity
also have been observed among black cervix cancer
patients treated on GOG clinical trials (unpublished correspondence18), suggesting that black patients may have
more tolerance to the emetogenic effects of chemotherapy. Ethnic hematologic tolerance associated with chemotherapy may also be different. Lower basal white blood
cell and platelet levels have been reported among black
women in population-based studies. Ethnic neutropenia
has been described in women receiving chemotherapy
with reduced white blood cells noted both at baseline and
throughout treatment.19 Hershman et al19 found in a
study of 472 stage I and stage II breast cancer patients that
lower levels of white blood cells were observed in Blacks
versus Whites and that this was associated with a prolongation of treatment (19 weeks vs 15 weeks), resulting in
less dose intensity treatment. Other studies have shown
that although leukopenia is more common in Blacks with
colon cancer, severe leukopenia is less frequent when compared with Whites.17 We observed no difference in severe
thrombocytopenia or leukopenia between black and white
patients.
The data that we have observed in this study and our
previous analysis8 suggest that a racial disparity in outcome persists in a setting in which patients receive similar
treatment (ie, surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy)
for advanced stage or recurrent endometrial cancer. In our
current study, Blacks were found to have a lower response
rate to platinum- and Adriamycin-based chemotherapy,
suggesting that there may be unconventional differences
in the endometrial cancers that develop in Blacks compared with Whites. Previous mutational analysis has
shown a racial disparity in the 2 most commonly altered
tumor suppressor genes found in endometrial cancers.
The phosphatase and tensin homologue tumor suppressor
gene, which is associated with endometrial cancers that
have a more favorable prognosis, is found more often
among Whites compared with Blacks.20 Conversely, the
mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene are more often found in Blacks and associated with a poor prognosis.21,22 Recent microarray studies have attempted to

360

identify additional racial disparities in global gene expression that could, in part, explain differences in outcome.23,24 If biologic differences in the endometrial
cancers from black and Women exist, future pharmacogenomic or more selective contemporary chemotherapeutic
therapy may be used to provide individualized treatment
that is targeted to the molecular profile of the patient.25,26
It should be mentioned that this study was a retrospective analysis. Although the total sample size is large,
the number of black patients was still small. We consider
the results from these data as exploratory. More data from
endometrial cancer or other cancer patients treated with
cisplatin-based chemotherapy will be needed to validate if
black patients may be less likely to develop some specific
type of adverse effects.
