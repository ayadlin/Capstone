ABSTRACT
Functional inhibition of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded nuclear antigen 1
(EBNA1) can cause the death of EBV infected cells. In this study, a bioinformatics
tool predicted the existence of putative extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
docking and substrate consensus sites on EBNA1, suggesting that ERK2 could bind
to and phosphorylate EBNA1. In accordance, ERK2 was found to phosphorylate
EBNA1 serine 383 in a reaction suppressed by H20 (a structural congener of the ERK
inhibitor), U0126 (an inhibitor of MEK kinase), and mutations at substrate (S383A)
or putative ERK docking sites. Wild-type (S383) and phosphomimetic (S383D) EBNA1
demonstrated comparable transactivation function, which was suppressed by H20
or U0126. In contrast, non-phosphorylated EBNA1 mutants displayed significantly
impaired transactivation activity. ERK2 knock-down by siRNA, or treatment with
U0126 or H20 repressed EBNA1-dependent transactivation.Collectively, these
data indicate that blocking ERK2-directed phosphorylation can suppress EBNA1transactivation function in latent EBV-infected cells, validating ERK2 as a drug target
for EBV-associated disorders.

of (latent viral genome) plasmid replication (OriP) and
transcription enhancer. DD/DBD enables latent EBV
episomes to replicate, while RG domains tether replicated
episomes to chromosomes during partitioning. Thus, an
EBNA1 inhibitor can potentially terminate latent EBV
infection and cancel any effect of EBV in non-malignant
and malignant diseases.
Our previous studies identified three selective
EBNA1 inhibitors: Roscovitine (a cyclin-dependent
kinase1/2 (CDK1/2) inhibitor), H20 (a structural congener
of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor),
and U0126 (an inhibitor of Mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase 1(MEK1)) [23-25]. While Roscovitine
targets multiple CDKs, cellular targets of H20 have been
elusive. Surface plasmon resonance showed binding of
H20 to a.a. 459-607 of viral EBNA1, and in silico analyses
suggested that H20 docked in pocket 2 of EBNA1,
surrounded by K514, Y518, R521, and P535. Interestingly,

INTRODUCTION
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) usually infects and
replicates in oropharyngeal epithelial cells [1-3]. In
latent infections, EBV genome integration is unusual;
instead, EBV persists as a multi-copy episome causing
lymphomas and carcinomas [4-7] [8-12]. EBV-encoded
nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) is essential for EBV episome
persistence and transcription in dividing cells [13-16]. For
this, EBNA1 contains three essential domains: arginineglycine-rich domain 1 (RG1) (a.a. 61-83), RG2 (a.a. 325376), and dimerization/cognate DNA binding domain
(DD/DBD) (a.a. 459-607) [17, 18]. Both RG1 and RG2
are necessary and sufficient for EBNA1 to associate with
its target DNA, and are essential for EBNA1-dependent
transcription of latent genes and genome persistence [17,
19-22]. DD/DBD binds specifically to 24 cognate sites
in an EBV repetitive sequence that serves as an origin

this pocket overlapped with the predicted ERK docking
motif and the structure of H20 was similar to that of the
ERK docking inhibitor (ERKi), which prevented ERK
association with the substrate [24]. These findings suggest
that H20 could affect ERK2-directed phosphorylation.
Here, we provide experimental evidence supporting
the role of ERK2 in EBNA1-mediated persistent EBV
infection, and propose ERK2 as a novel drug target.

surface accessibility. In support of this hypothesis, our
previous studies indicated that inhibitors of 18 different
kinases redundantly or selectively inhibited EBNA1dependent transactivation activity [23, 24].

RESULTS

Using an in vitro kinase assay, we observed
thatcatalytically active recombinant ERK2 phosphorylated
EBNA1 at a.a. 379-641, and 380-394, but not at a.a. 387-641
or 384-398 (Figure 1B; data not shown). Phosphorylation
was entirely abrogated in the case of a point mutation at a
putative phosphorylation site (denoted S383A), suggesting
that ERK2 phosphorylated EBNA1 at serine 383 (S383). In
addition, phosphorylation was completely absent in double
mutations (DM) of the ERK2 docking motif at a.a. 526-528
LAI528 → 526PAS528), but not of the near cyclin-binding
526
motif (T582F). Point mutation at I528S also impaired
phosphorylation, albeit less effectively. In accordance with
the above data, ERK2-directed phosphorylation of EBNA1
was partially impaired by H20 [24]. Given that the in
vitro kinase assay lacked MEK1, U0126 had no effect on
ERK2-directed EBNA1 phosphorylation (data not shown).
Moreover, the in vitro kinase assay clearly showed that
the ERK docking motif was required for ERK2-directed
phosphorylation at EBNA1 S383.

Potential ERK2-directed phosphorylation site on
EBNA1
Having identified H20 and U0126 as inhibitors
of EBNA1, we hypothesized that ERK phosphorylated
EBNA1 [23]. We used the ELM, NetPhopho and Motif
Scan proteomic tools listed in the Expasy repository
(http://www.expasy.org/proteomics), and applied the
option of scanning the full length EBNA1 FASTA file
(>gi|23893623|emb|CAD53427.1| EBNA-1 protein [Human
herpesvirus 4]). The eukaryotic linear motif (http://elm.
eu.org) and Netphos 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
NetPhos/) tool predicted the existence of a putative motif
for ERK2-directed proline-dependent phosphorylation at
a.a. 381-384 (PRSP), and a potential ERK docking site at
a.a. 521-528RRGTALAI) on the surface of EBNA1 [26]

ERK2 associates with EBNA1 in vivo

and 641. Taking together, these results suggest that ERK2
associates with EBNA1 directly via EBNA1 a.a. 521-528
(Figure 1C), and indirectly via an unknown protein linker
between a.a. 379-641 (Figure 2C, 2D).

The presence of an ERK docking motif on EBNA1
led us to test whether ERK associated with EBNA1
via this motif. Using an anti-FLAG (M2) antibody, we
were able to pull down FLAG-tagged EBNA1 (FE1)
and, less efficiently, ERK2 (Figure 2A), but not the
isotype control. This was further confirmed by reciprocal
immunoprecipitation (IPs), whereby anti-ERK2 efficiently
pulled down EBNA1 (Figure 2B; Supplementary Figure
S1). Contrary to the hypothesis, DM in the ERK docking
motif did not abrogate the interaction between EBNA1
and ERK2 (Figure 2C). To our surprise, a quadruple
mutation (QM) within a.a. 521-528 (521RRGTALAI528
→ 521AAGTAPAS528) further increased the interaction
(Figure 2D). This indicates the presence of redundant
ERK docking motif sites on EBNA1 between a.a. 379

ERK2-directed phosphorylation of EBNA1
contributes to EBNA1-dependent transactivation
Wild-type (WT) EBNA1 (S383), phosphorylationdeficient alanine (S383A), and phosphomimetic peptide
(S383D) substitutions were tested for transactivation
function in a full-length FE1 background in the presence
or absence of U0126, and H20, or ERK2 siRNA. While
transcriptional activity of WT EBNA1 was >140 fold,
S383A and S383D had only 32 fold (22% of WT) and
92 fold activity (~66% of WT), respectively (Figure 3A).
WT- and S383D-dependent transactivation functions were

ERK2 IP efficiency in FE1 cells, substantial FE1 was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-ERK2 antibody. The low ERK2 IP efficiency in FE1
cells, compared to vector control, was due to experimental deviation seen in this specific case (See also Supplementary Figure S1). C–D.

hE1 non-specific interaction with other cellular kinases, the same membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-PKM2 antibody. Results
show that mutations in the putative ERK docking motif of EBNA1 did not abrogate interaction between EBNA1 and ERK2.

repressed by H20 [24] and U0126. This additional inhibitory
effect was significantly diminished in S383A, further
confirming that S383 was the primary target for U0126
and H20 (Figure 3B). In another assay based on EBNA1dependent transactivation of an OriP-harboring reporter,
EBNA1 S383A, I528S, or DM showed much lower activity
(< ~50%, 39%, and 10%, respectively) (Figure 3A). Next,
we tested the effect of siRNA-mediated depletion of ERK2
on EBNA1-dependent transactivation. Unlike ERK1
siRNA, ERK2 siRNA could deplete its target transcript by
>50 % within 3 days after transient transfection. In multiple
independent experiments using BJAB Burkitt’s lymphoma
cells, ERK2 knockdown decreased transcription of the the
EBNA1-dependent reporter but not of the co-transfected
EBNA1-independent SV40p-Renilla luciferase (SV40pRL) reporter (Figure 3C).
To better understand the above findings in the
context of EBV biology, we performed the reporter assays
in two freshly EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell
lines (LCLs), MK and JY, and an old LCL, IB4. ERK2
siRNA specifically reduced EBNA1-mediated OriPlinked firefly luciferase reporter activity (normalized to
co-transfected SV40p-RL), while scramble siRNA-treated
cells were indistinguishable from negative controls. It
should be noted that ERK2 knockdown was less robust
in LCL (Figure 4) than in BJAB cells (Figure 3), possibly
due to lower transfection efficiency [27]. In addition,

treatment of LCLs with U0126 lowered EBNA1dependent transactivation after only 2 days (Figure 4B).

Treatment with U0126 or S383A mutation
have no significant effect on EBNA1 nuclear or
cytoplasmic localization
Serine 383 is located within the EBNA1 nuclear
localization signal (a.a. 379-386), where several serines
control EBNA1 localization [28]. To explore the effect
of mutation or U0126 treatment on EBNA1 sub cellular
localization, BJAB cells stably expressing FLAG-EBNA1
S383 (FE1 S383) or S383A (FE1 S383A) were treated
with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (-) or U0126 (10 μM) for
4 days. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were isolated
and probed with antibodies against EBNA1, transcription
factor Sp1 (nucleus), α-tubulin (cytoplasm), and β-actin
(normalization). No substantial differences in EBNA1
subcellular localization or expression could be found
between WT and S383A EBNA1.expressing cells upon
U0126 treatment (Supplementary Figure S2A). Similarly,
live cell confocal microscopy showed that the subcellular
localizations of stably expressed EGFP-EBNA1 S383 or
S383A were almost identical in BJAB cells. This indicates
that the S383A mutation did not affect EBNA1 subcellular
localization or shuttling between nucleus and cytoplasm
(Supplementary Figure S2B).

BJAB cells were transiently co-transfected with a control vector, EBNA1 S383, S383A, S528, and PAS, along with EBNA1-dependent
(POLP2) and -independent (SV40p-RL) reporters. B. After transient co-transfection of indicated expression plasmids with reporters (see
above), cells were divided into three aliquots, and treated with ERKi in the absence or presence of DMSO, H20 (0.5 μM), and U0126
(10 μM). Slight difference in EBNA1 protein size resulted from variations in glycine-alanine (GA) repeats during PCR, as can be seen
from Western blots underneath. C. Use of scramble siRNA or three different siRNAs against ERK2 (siERK2_1, _2, _3) resulted in partial
knockdown 3 days post transfection of BJ-FE1 cells. These and control (siCTL) cells were transiently transfected with POLP2 and SV40pRL reporters and assayed after 2 days. Note that the lower transactivation (~15 fold) is due to use of a stable BJAB cell line constitutively
expressing FE1, which is usually lower than transiently transfected FE1.

DISCUSSION

Taken together, we present a schematic diagram of the
kinase cascade and ERK2-EBNA1 interaction (Figure 5).
S393 is phosphorylated by CDK/cyclin complexes, and the
S393A mutation was previously described as having no effect
on transcription activity and only 60% persistence [23]. In this
study, S383 has emerged as the site for ERK2 phosphorylation
of EBNA1 (Figure 5A). Multiple kinases participate in
phosphorylation on a.a. 380-390, and prior phosphorylation
is often required for subsequent phosphorylation cascades.
For example, ERK2- or CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation
at S383 in EBNA1 may enhance CK1-dependent
phosphorylation on S386 (Figure 5A). In addition to S393,
here we provide evidence of the importance of S383 for
EBNA1-dependent transactivation. Although we do not know
how ERK2-directed phosphorylation affects EBNA1 activity,
phosphorylated S383 may alter EBNA1 protein stability or
change its affinity towards interacting proteins. To this end,
the S385A mutation has lower binding affinity for the nuclear
import adaptor protein, Importin subunit alpha 5 [28].

The bioinformatics ELM tool predicted
that 25 serines on EBNA1 could be redundantly
phosphorylated by at least 10 different serine/
threonine kinases. These include: protein kinase
A, casein kinase 1 (CK1), casein kinase 2 (CK2),
glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), never in mitosis
A-related kinases 2, phosphoinositide-3-OH-kinase
related kinases (a.a. 383-389), protein kinase B, pololike kinase, proline-directed kinases (such as MAPK
or ERK) (a.a. 380-386, 390-396), calcium/calmodulindependent protein kinase type II (CaMKII), and
CDK1. EBNA1 can be phosphorylated on multiple
serines, though not on threonines or tyrosines [29, 30].
It is experimentally proven that CK2, CDKs, and the
only EBV kinase analogue to cellular CDKs (BGLF4)
can phosphorylate multiple serine residues on EBNA1
[31] [23] [32, 33].

LCLs (MK, JY) and an old LCL (IB4) were transiently co-transfected with POLP2, EBNA1-independent SV40p-RL along with siCTL
(scrambles control siRNA) or siRNA2_1(100 nM) (See Figure 3). B. LCLs transiently transfected with POLP2 and SV40p-RL were
divided in two aliquots, treated for 2 days with U0126 (10 μM) or DMSO, and subjected to reporter assay. In A and B, EBNA1-specific
firefly luciferase was normalized to EBNA1-independent RL. SiERK2 and U0126 activities were compared to the normalized activity in
siCTL or DMSO treated cells, where it was set to 100%.

Consensus sites and comments for indicated kinase are as follows: ERK2 (PxS/TP or xxS/TP, CaMK II (RxxS/T), CDK1 (S/TPxR/K), CK1*
(SxxS/T), GSK3b* (SxxxS), bold S/T (phosphorylation site), underlined S (prior phosphorylation site needed for subsequent phosphorylation
at bold S), *cascade (prior phosphorylation)-dependent phosphorylation. B. Model of EBNA1-ERK2 interaction. A putative ERK docking
motif (521DOCK528) on EBNA1 mediates a direct interaction with ERK2 and phosphorylation at S383 but is dispensable for in vivo interaction.
An unknown protein linker (X) likely mediates ERK2 and EBNA1 interaction in vivo through an unknown site (BIND?-?) on EBNA1.

The in vitro kinase assay showed a potential
direct interaction between EBNA1 a.a.379-641 and
ERK2 (Figure 5B). DM abolished ERK2-mediated
phosphorylation in vitro, indicating that the original
sequence was required for association-dependent
phosphorylation. Given that DM could not abolish
this interaction in vivo, and QM even augmented it, we
speculate there is a secondary site in EBNA1 responsible
for direct or indirect association with ERK2 (Figure 5B).
Bioinformatics analysis did not predict any direct ERK
docking sites on EBNA1 other than a.a. 521-528. This
leaves the possibility of a protein linker regulating the
indirect association of ERK2 with EBNA1 a.a. 379-641.
The identity and mechanistic role of the protein linker
and docking site are beyond the scope of this study.
It is nevertheless clear that S383 and the ERK docking
motif are required for ERK2-directed phosphorylation
of EBNA1 and its EBNA1 transactivation function.
Therefore, it is equally possible that other kinases, such as
viral BGLF4, CDKs, or CKs, may phosphorylate S383A
in vivo [31] [23] [32].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Finally, this study provides a rationale for why
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors were
found to block also EBNA1 [23]. Given that many EGFR
signaling pathways converge on ERK2, EGFR inhibitors
negatively affect ERK2 activity, and thus actively repress
EBNA1-dependent transactivation [23].

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids and chemicals
FLAG-EBNA1 (FE1), enhanced green fluorescent
protein-tagged EBNA1 (EGFP-EBNA1), and EBNA1dependent reporters (OriP-EBV), C promoter-driven
firefly luciferase (OriPCp-FL) and OriP-enhancer linked
minimal promoter-driven firefly luciferase with puromyin
cassette (POLP2) have been described previously [20] [23].
EBNA1-independent reporters, pSV40 promoter-driven
Renilla luciferase (RL) or pGK promoter-β galactosidase
(pGK- βgal), were used to estimate cell viability. Six
histidine-tagged EBNA1 sequences (hE1) (a.a. 387-641,

379-641, 459-607) were cloned into plasmid pET28a
(Invitrogen Life Sciences, Carlsbad, CA) [23]. EBNA1
mutants S383A, PAS (double mutation; DM), AAGTAPAS
(quadruple mutation; QM) were generated using Quick
Change (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Primers are listed in
Supplementary Table S1. FE1_S383 (131 glycine-alanine
repeats), S383A (131 GA), S383D (<123 GA), I528S
(~133GA), DM (~133 GA), and QM (131 GA) were
generated using a full length FE1 WT S383 template with
all 235 GA repeats (a.a. 90-324) [20] [23]. Primers are
listed in Supplementary Table S1. Consistent with previous
reports the length of GA repeats did not affect EBNA1
transactivation activity [34]. In addition, EGFP-EBNA1
S383A was made using EGFP-EBNA1 as template [20].
Partial or complete GA removal, resulting from an in-frame
deletion during PCR, did not affect EBNA1 functionality
unless there were fewer than 25 GA repeats [20, 35, 36].
U0126 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(catalog no. 9903; Danvers, MA) and H20 was synthesized
as previously described by the authors [24].

KCL, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1× protease
inhibitor cocktail); nuclear extracts were obtained using 1×
hypertonic buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 0.4 M NaCl, 1
mM EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail).
Extracts were stored at −80°C until assayed. Subcellular
localization of EGFP-EBNA1 S383 WT and S383A MT
in BJAB cells was assayed by live confocal microscopy
as described previously [20].

Purification and kinase assay of 6× histidineEBNA1
Different EBNA1 constructs (387-641 WT, 379~641 WT, or MTs of S383A, I528S, T582F, PAS (DM),
and AAGTAPAS (QM)) were tagged with 6× histidine
at the N-terminus and purified from Escherichia coli
BL21 (DE3) Rosetta/pLysS cells as described previously
[23]. Each purified EBNA1 was incubated with 20 U
catalytically active recombinant ERK2 (NEB, Beverly,
MA), in the supplied buffer containing 200 μM ATP and
[γ32P] ATP in the presence or absence of compounds, as
indicated previously [23].

Cell lines and reporter assay
EBV-negative human Burkitt’s lymphoma cells
(BJAB), BJAB cells that stably expressed FE1 (BJ-FE1), BJFE1 cells with EBNA1-dependent episomal OriPCp-FL (or
POLP2), and BJ-FE1 with integrated EBNA1-independent
SV40p-RL (BJ-FE1-OF) have been described previously
[20]. Where necessary, EBV-immortalized fresh LCLs (MK,
JY) were established from peripheral blood as described
[27]. For the EBNA1-transactivation reporter assay, cells
were transiently co-transfected with EBNA1-dependent
and independent reporters (and EBNA1 in case of BJAB
cells), and then aliquoted for treatment with the indicated
compounds. Cell extracts were subjected to reporter assays 2-3
days after transfection [23] using Dual-Glo Luciferase reporter
system (Promega, Madison, WI). When necessary, ERK2
transcripts were depleted in BJ-FE1 cells for 2-4 days by
transfecting siRNAs specific for ERK 1, ERK2, or a scramble
sequence (Supplementary Table S1). Next, EBNA1-dependent
POLP2 and EBNA1-independent SV40p-RL reporters were
transiently transfected to assess the effect of ERK depletion
on EBNA1-dependent transactivation. In LCLs, cells were
transiently transfected with PLOP2 and SV40p-RL, divided
into two, and treated for 2 days with U0126 (10 μM) or
DMSO. EBNA1-specific firefly luciferase was normalized
to EBNA1-independent RL. siERK2 or U0126 activity were
compared to the normalized activity of control siRNA (siCTL)
or DMSO-treated cells, which was set to 100%.

Immunoprecipitation
Cell extracts from stable BJAB cells expressing
vector control or FE1 were prepared inlysis buffer (50
mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM EDTA,
1% NP40, 3% glycerol, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml
aprotinin).Cell extracts were precleared with Protein G/A
agarose beads (10% v/v of 50% bead slurry), washed
3× with 1% lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated using
anti-FLAG, anti-ERK2, or IgG isotype control antibodies
as described previously [23]. Immune complexes were
resolved on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) protein
gels, blotted and probed with anti-FLAG, anti-EBNA1 (JT
anti-EBV human serum, or EBNA1 monoclonal antibody
from Advanced Biotechnology Inc., Eldersburg, MD), and
anti-ERK2 (C14/C16; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX) antibodies.
Alternatively, 6× histidine-tagged EBNA1 a.a. 379-641
WT, DM, and QM were incubated each with either buffer
control or BJAB cell extracts (106 cells) as a source of
cellular kinases (i.e., ERK2), subsequently pulled-down
by His-bind magnetic agarose beads (EBE-1038; Elpis
Biotech, Daejeon, Korea), washed and subjected to
western blotting using anti-His-tag, anti-ERKs, and antipyruvate kinase muscle type isoform 2 (PKM2) antibodies.
