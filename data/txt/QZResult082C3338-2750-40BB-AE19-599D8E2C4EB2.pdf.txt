Abstract
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer
death in the United States, and the aggressiveness of pancreatic
cancer is in part due to its intrinsic and extrinsic drug
resistance characteristics, which are also associated with the
acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
Emerging evidence also suggests that the processes of EMT
are regulated by the expression status of many microRNAs
(miRNA), which are believed to function as key regulators
of various biological and pathologic processes during tumor
development and progression. In the present study, we
compared the expression of miRNAs between gemcitabinesensitive and gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells and
investigated whether the treatment of cells with ‘‘natural
agents’’ [3,3¶-diindolylmethane (DIM) or isoflavone] could
affect the expression of miRNAs. We found that the expression
of miR-200b, miR-200c, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, and let-7e was
significantly down-regulated in gemcitabine-resistant cells,
which showed EMT characteristics such as elongated fibroblastoid morphology, lower expression of epithelial marker
E-cadherin, and higher expression of mesenchymal markers
such as vimentin and ZEB1. Moreover, we found that
reexpression of miR-200 by transfection studies or treatment
of gemcitabine-resistant cells with either DIM or isoflavone
resulted in the down-regulation of ZEB1, slug, and vimentin,
which was consistent with morphologic reversal of EMT
phenotype leading to epithelial morphology. These results
provide experimental evidence, for the first time, that DIM and
isoflavone could function as miRNA regulators leading to the
reversal of EMT phenotype, which is likely to be important for
designing novel therapies for pancreatic cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer
death in the United States with an estimated 37,680 new cases and
34,290 deaths in 2008 (1). For all stages combined, the 5-year
relative survival rate is only 5%. The aggressiveness of pancreatic
cancer could, in part, be due to their intrinsic and extrinsic drug

resistance characteristics, resulting in their invasive behavior
during early stages of carcinogenesis. Most patients diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer are unresectable and usually die from
metastatic disease even after treatment with existing therapies.
Therefore, there is a dire need for understanding the molecular
mechanism involved in drug resistance and developing novel
therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance for the
successful treatment of pancreatic cancer.
Recent studies have shown that epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) is associated with drug resistance and cancer
cell metastasis (2–4). For most epithelial tumors, progression
toward malignancy is accompanied by a loss of epithelial
differentiation and a shift toward mesenchymal phenotype (5).
During the acquisition of EMT characteristics, cancer cells lose
the expression of proteins that promote cell-cell contact, such as
E-cadherin and g-catenin, and gain the expression of mesenchymal
markers, such as vimentin, fibronectin, and N-cadherin, leading to
enhanced cancer cell migration and invasion (5). Studies have also
shown that cancer cells in the tumor center remain positive for
the expression of E-cadherin and cytoplasmic h-catenin; however,
the tumor cells in the periphery with propensity for invasion
display loss of surface E-cadherin and up-regulation of vimentin,
the typical characteristics of EMT phenotype (6). EMT has been
shown to be important on conferring drug resistance characteristics to cancer cells against conventional therapeutics including
Taxol, vincristine, oxaliplatin, or epidermal growth factor receptor–
targeted therapy (4). Therefore, novel inhibitors of EMT or agents
that could either reverse the EMT phenotype or kill EMT-type cells
would be a novel strategy for the treatment of most pancreatic
cancer. Moreover, agents that could either reduce drug resistance
or reverse it would likely be useful for increasing therapeutic
activity of conventional therapeutics.
Alteration in the expression of critical molecules has been
observed during the acquisition of EMT phenotype, consistent
with their association in cellular signal transduction pathways.
The down-regulation and relocation of E-cadherin and zonula
occludens-1, the translocation of h-catenin from cell membrane to
nucleus, and the activation of Slug, Twist, and ZEB1 transcription
factors result in the induction of EMT phenotype (7–12). Moreover,
emerging evidence implicated the critical role of microRNAs
(miRNA) because they are key regulatory molecules in various
biological and pathologic processes including EMT. These small,
non-coding molecules elicit their regulatory effects by imperfectly
binding to the 3¶-untranslated region of target mRNA, causing
either degradation of mRNA or inhibition of their translation to
functional proteins (13, 14). The expression of miRNAs has been
recognized as integral components of many normal biological
processes, such as those involving cell proliferation, differentiation,

Regulation of miR-200 by B-DIM and Isoflavone

apoptosis, and stress resistance (15). Moreover, it has been recently
suggested that aberrant expression of miRNAs is associated with
the development and progression cancer. Many studies have
established this concept by discovering the up-regulation or downregulation of specific miRNAs in various types of cancer and
identifying some of their molecular targets (16–18). More
importantly, miRNAs have been found to be the regulators of
EMT (19); thus, miRNA appears to play important roles in cancer
development and progression (18, 20).
Although the role of miRNAs in cancer has been documented,
there are very few studies documenting the cellular consequence
due to targeted inactivation or reexpression of specific miRNA.
Therefore, we hypothesized that alteration in the expression of
miRNAs could be achieved by treating cancer cells with ‘‘natural
agents’’ [3,3¶-diindolylmethane (DIM) or isoflavone] and that the
‘‘natural agents’’ could cause reversal of EMT phenotype leading to
cancer cell death. It has been well known that dietary chemopreventive agents inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo
through the regulation of cell signaling transduction (21, 22).
Importantly, we have found previously that the dietary compounds,
including isoflavone genistein and DIM, could enhance the
antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic agents through different
mechanisms (23, 24), suggesting that these compounds could exert
their pleiotropic effects on cancer treatment through regulation of
various cellular signaling pathways. In this study, we assessed the
expression pattern of miRNAs between gemcitabine-sensitive and
gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells. Moreover, we
investigated whether the treatment of gemcitabine-resistant cells
with either B-DIM (BioResponse-formulated DIM with greater
bioavailability) or G2535 (a mixture of genistein and other
isoflavones) could alter the expression profile of miRNAs and also
assessed the cellular consequence. We found that the miRNA
expression pattern was different between gemcitabine-sensitive
and gemcitabine-resistant cells. The gemcitabine-resistant cells
showed EMT characteristics and the treatment of gemcitabineresistant cells with either of the natural agents altered the
expression of miRNAs, causing partial reversal of EMT phenotype,
which was also achieved by reexpression of specific miRNA by
transfection studies. These results suggest that reexpression of
specific miRNA by nontoxic ‘‘natural agents’’ could be a useful
strategy for the reversal of EMT phenotype, which could lead to
the reversal of drug resistance and the sensitization of pancreatic
cancer cells to conventional therapeutic agents for the successful
treatment of pancreatic cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, reagents, and antibodies. The reported gemcitabineresistant human pancreatic cancer cell lines, MiaPaCa-2, Panc-1, and
Aspc-1 (25), were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37jC. The reported gemcitabine-sensitive human pancreatic cancer cell lines, L3.6pl, Colo357, BxPC-3,
and HPAC (25), were cultured in DMEM or RPMI 1640 ( for BxPC-3)
supplemented with fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. B-DIM (BioResponse; known as BR-DIM and called B-DIM with higher bioavailability
in vivo) was generously provided by Dr. Michael Zeligs (26) and was
dissolved in DMSO to make a 50 mmol/L stock solution. Isoflavone mixture
G2535 (70.54% genistein, 26.34% diadzin, and 0.31% glycitein manufactured
by Organic Technologies and obtained from NIH) was dissolved in DMSO to
make a stock solution containing 50 mmol/L genistein. The concentration
of isoflavone we described in this article refers to the concentration of

www.aacrjournals.org

genistein in isoflavone mixture. Anti-ZEB1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti-E-cadherin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-vimentin (DAKO), and
anti–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma) primary antibodies were used for Western blot analysis and immunofluorescent staining.
RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted by using the mirVana miRNA
Isolation Kit (Ambion) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, MiaPaCa-2, Panc-1, Aspc-1, L3.6pl, Colo357, BxPC-3, and HPAC
cells were treated with 25 Amol/L B-DIM or 25 Amol/L G2535 for 48 h.
Control cells received 0.05% DMSO. Then, the cells from each condition
were exposed to Lysis/Binding Solution and vortexed vigorously to obtain a
homogenous lysate. miRNA Homogenate Additive was added to the lysate
and incubated on ice for 10 min. After incubation, acid-phenol:chloroform
was added and the lysate was subsequently vortexed and centrifuged for
5 min at 10,000  g. The aqueous phase was recovered and transferred to a
fresh tube. After addition of 100% ethanol, each lysate/ethanol mixture was
added to a filter cartridge and pulled through via centrifugation at 10,000  g.
Two wash solutions were added to the filter and pulled through via the same
method. The total RNA was obtained by adding preheated (95jC) Elution
Solution to the filter cartridge and centrifuging.
miRNA microarray and data analysis. Five micrograms of each total
RNA sample from MiaPaCa-2, Panc-1, L3.6pl, and Colo357 cells were sent to
a service provider for completion of the miRNA microarrays (LCSciences).
In LCSciences, the total RNA samples were enriched for miRNAs and the
miRNA microarrays were done on AParaFlo microfluidic chips (version
10.0), each of which has a miRNA probe region with multiple repeat regions
that detect 711 miRNAs. Multiple control probes are also included on the
microarrays for assessing various chip and assay qualities such as
uniformity and specificity. Chips were scanned and the data were
normalized. The t tests were done and the predicting target genes for
various miRNAs were also analyzed.
miRNA real-time reverse transcription-PCR. To verify the alterations
in the expression of specific miRNAs that were found to be altered in
miRNA microarray analysis, we chose representative miRNA (miR-200a,
miR-200b, miR-200c, let-7b, let-7e, miR-106b, and miRNA-221) with varying
expression profiles for real-time miRNA reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
analysis using TaqMan MicroRNA Assay Kit (Applied Biosystems) following
the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 5 ng of total RNA from each sample
were subjected to reverse transcription with a specific miRNA primer
(Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCRs were then carried out in a total of
25 AL reaction mixture (1.66 AL RT product, 1.25 AL of 20 TaqMan miRNA
Assay Mix, 12.5 AL of 2 TaqMan PCR Master Mix, and 9.59 AL distilled
H2O) in SmartCycler II (Cepheid). The PCR program was initiated by 10 min
at 95jC before 40 thermal cycles, each at 15 s at 95jC and 1 min at 60jC.
Data were analyzed according to the comparative Ct method and
normalized by RNU6B expression in each sample.
Real-time RT-PCR using mRNA. Real-time RT-PCR analysis was also
conducted to measure the expression of genes (E-cadherin, vimentin, and
slug), which are critically related to EMT in pancreatic cancer cells with and
without 25 Amol/L B-DIM and 25 Amol/L G2535 treatment. Briefly, 1 Ag of
total RNA from each sample was subjected to reverse transcription using
the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Real-time PCRs were then carried out in a total of
25 AL reaction mixture (2 AL cDNA, 12.5 AL of 2 SYBR Green PCR Master
Mix from Applied Biosystems, 1.5 AL of each 5 Amol/L forward and reverse
primers, and 7.5 AL distilled H2O) in SmartCycler II (Cepheid). The PCR
program was initiated by 10 min at 95jC before 40 thermal cycles, each at
15 s at 95jC and 1 min at 60jC. Data were analyzed according to the
comparative Ct method and normalized by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase expression in each sample.
Western blot analysis. We also conducted Western blot analysis to
verify the alterations in the protein expression of genes, which are targets of
miRNA or critically involved in EMT. The gemcitabine-sensitive and
gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells were treated with or without
25 Amol/L B-DIM or 25 Amol/L G2535 for 48 h. After treatment, the cells
were lysed in 62.5 mmol/L Tris-HCl and 2% SDS, and protein concentration
was measured using BCA protein assay (Pierce). The proteins were
subjected to 10% or 14% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to

nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were incubated with specific
primary antibodies and subsequently incubated with secondary antibody
conjugated with peroxidase (Bio-Rad). The signal was then detected using
the chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce).
Reexpression of miR-200 in gemcitabine-resistant cells. MiaPaCa-2
and Panc-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with miR200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, or miRNA negative control (Ambion) at a final
concentration of 20 nmol/L using DharmaFect Transfection Reagent
(Dharmacon). After 3 days of transfection, the cells were split and
transfected repeatedly with the miRNA every 3 to 4 days for the indicated
times. Total RNA from each samples was then extracted using the Trizol
reagent (Invitrogen). One microgram of RNA was subject to RT-PCR using
the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) as described earlier. Total proteins
from each sample were also extracted and subjected to Western blot
analysis as described earlier.
Immunofluorescence staining. Immunofluorescence staining was done
following the standard protocol. Briefly, B-DIM–treated or G2535-treated
MiaPaCa-2 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in
0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked with 10% goat serum. The cells were then
incubated overnight with specific primary antibodies. After washing with
PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescence-conjugated secondary
antibody for 1 h. The slides were then washed with PBS and mounted with
mounting medium containing Anti-fade reagent and 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole. Cells were viewed under fluorescence microscope and images
were analyzed using Advanced Sport software (Diagnostic Instruments).
Exposure of gemcitabine-resistant cells to miR-200, B-DIM, or
G2535 and WST-1 assay for testing drug sensitivity. The gemcitabineresistant MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells were transfected with miR-200b
or control miRNA for 7 days or treated with lower concentration of B-DIM
(5 Amol/L) and G2535 (10 Amol/L) for 21 days. The morphologic changes in

MiaPaCa-2 cells were captured under a light microscopy. The cells were
then seeded in 96-well plates. After 24 h, the cells were treated with different
concentrations of gemcitabine for 48 h. After treatment, the cells were
subjected to cell proliferation assay using Cell Proliferation Reagent WST-1
assay (Roche) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 10 AL of WST-1
reagent were added to the cells in each well and incubated at 37jC for 2 h.
After shaking for 1 min, the spectrophotometric absorbance of the samples
was determined by using Ultra Multifunctional Microplate Reader (Tecan)
at 450 nm.

Results
Gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells show EMT
characteristics documented by miRNA, mRNA, and protein
expression. To investigate the difference in miRNA expression
between gemcitabine-sensitive and gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells, we conducted miRNA microarray. The results
from miRNA microarray were validated by miRNA RT-PCR analysis
for representative miRNA with varying expression profiles. The
similar alternations of miRNA expression were observed by realtime RT-PCR analysis, although the fold change in the expression
level was not exactly the same between these two different analytic
methods. By miRNA microarray and RT-PCR, we found differential
expression pattern of miRNA between gemcitabine-sensitive and
gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells. The known EMT
regulators such as miR-200b, miR-200c, and miR-200a were downregulated in gemcitabine-resistant cells (Table 1; Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1A), which is consistent with the EMT phenotype of
gemcitabine-resistant cells. We also found that many members

Regulation of miR-200 by B-DIM and Isoflavone

Figure 1. Real-time RT-PCR showed
that miR-200 family (A), let-7 family (A ),
and E-cadherin (B) were significantly
down-regulated and vimentin (B )
was up-regulated in gemcitabine-resistant
pancreatic cancer cells. Western blot
analysis (C ) showed that ZEB1 and
vimentin protein expression was
up-regulated and E-cadherin was
down-regulated in gemcitabine-resistant
pancreatic cancer cells.

of the tumor suppressor let-7 family were down-regulated in
gemcitabine-resistant cells (Table 1; Fig. 1A), and these findings are
consistent with the aggressiveness of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells. More importantly, we found that gemcitabinesensitive pancreatic cancer cells including L3.6pl, Colo357, BxPC-3,
and HPAC cells showed strong expression of epithelial marker Ecadherin, whereas gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells,
MiaPaCa-2, Panc-1, and Aspc-1, exhibited strong expression of
mesenchymal makers including vimentin and ZEB1 at mRNA and
protein levels (Fig. 1 B and C; Supplementary Fig. S1B and C).
These results suggest that the gemcitabine-resistant cells showing
EMT characteristics could be defined by the expression of specific
miRNA and its target genes and proteins. Based on these results on
the differential expression of miRNA, we hypothesized that ‘‘natural
agents’’ that are known to cause cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis could regulate the EMT status by the alterations
in the miRNA expression of gemcitabine-resistant cells. Therefore,
we investigated whether B-DIM or G2535 (isoflavone) treatment
could alter miRNA expression of gemcitabine-resistant cells.
Regulation of miRNA expression by B-DIM and G2535
treatment in pancreatic cancer cells. The miRNA microarrays
were also used to determine whether treatment of cells with B-DIM
or G2535 could alter the expression of miRNA compared with
untreated cells. The miRNA RT-PCR was also conducted to confirm
the data from miRNA array. By miRNA microarray and RT-PCR, we
found that B-DIM treatments caused alterations in the expression
of 28 miRNAs, whereas G2535 treatment altered the expression of
67 of a total of 711 miRNAs in the chip. Importantly, we found that
the members of miR-200 and let-7 families were up-regulated
on G2535 or B-DIM treatment (Table 1; Fig. 2; Supplementary

www.aacrjournals.org

Fig. S1A), suggesting that these agents could cause reversal of EMT
characteristics and in turn could inhibit tumor aggressiveness.
G2535 showed stronger effects on miR-200 and let-7 expression
than that of B-DIM as documented by miRNA microarray analysis
(Table 1). Based on these novel findings, especially the loss of
expression of miR-200 family in gemcitabine-resistant cells and
most importantly the up-regulation in the expression of miR-200
family, we assessed the mechanistic role of miR-200 family in our
experimental system.
Reexpression of miR-200 family leads to the alteration of
EMT markers. To investigate the role of miR-200 family in the
reversal of EMT phenotype of gemcitabine-resistant cells, we
transfected miR-200a, miR-200b, and miR-200c pre-miRNAs into
MiaPaCa-2 cells (gemcitabine-resistant) for up to 14 days. We
found that the reexpression of miR-200 family in the MiaPaCa-2
cells resulted in the up-regulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin
and down-regulation of mesenchymal markers including ZEB1 and
vimentin at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3A and B). After 14
days of transfection, the morphology of miR-200–transfected
MiaPaCa-2 cells was partially changed from elongated fibroblastoid
to epithelial cobblestone-like appearance, and the cells appeared to
grow in close contact with each other (Fig. 3C). These results
suggest that the loss of miR-200 family is critical for the acquisition
of EMT characteristics and that the reexpression of miR-200 could
reverse the EMT phenotype of gemcitabine-resistant cells. Because
reexpression of miRNA by transfection is not a practically useful
strategy at the present time in clinical setting, we investigated
whether ‘‘natural agents’’ could be useful for such a purpose and, if
so, then the natural agents could be easily tested for their effects in
the clinical setting.

B-DIM and G2535 treatment leads to the regulation of EMT
marker expression and the reversal of EMT. Because we
observed that B-DIM and G2535 treatments increased the level of
miR-200 family in MiaPaCa-2 cells, we further investigated whether
B-DIM and G2535 treatment could show similar effects that were
observed by reexpression of miR-200 family using transfection
approach. After the treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with low
concentration of B-DIM (5 Amol/L) and G2535 (10 Amol/L) for
21 days, we found up-regulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin
and down-regulation of mesenchymal markers, ZEB1, vimentin,
and slug, at different levels tested by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 4A;
Supplementary Fig. S1B) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 4B;
Supplementary Fig. S1C). Immunofluorescence staining showed
that E-cadherin was redistributed in the cytoplasm closer to cell
membrane after B-DIM and G2535 treatments (Fig. 5A). Impor-

tantly, we also observed that the morphology of MiaPaCa-2 cells
changed from elongated fibroblastoid to epithelial cobblestone-like
appearance, and it seems that the cell-cell contact was increased
after the treatments with B-DIM and G2535 (Fig. 5B). These results
are consistent with the changes in the expression of miRNAs and
EMT markers. We also noted that some pancreatic cancer cells
treated with G2535 showed more elongated shape, which was
commonly seen in genistein-treated cells; however, G2535 has
stronger effect on E-cadherin expression, whereas B-DIM exerted
stronger effect on ZEB1 expression as shown by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 4B). Nevertheless, these results suggest that both
B-DIM and isoflavone could regulate the expression of EMT
markers and indeed could be useful for the reversal of EMT
phenotype, which could lead to the sensitization of gemcitabineresistant cells to gemcitabine. Therefore, we assessed the sensitivity

of gemcitabine-resistant cells to gemcitabine after being transfected with miR-200b or treated with B-DIM or G2535.
miR-200 reexpression or B-DIM and G2535 treatment
increased sensitivity of gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic
cancer cells to gemcitabine. We transfected MiaPaCa-2 cells
with miR-200b or control miRNA for a period of 7 days. We also
treated MiaPaCa-2 cells with or without low concentration of
B-DIM or G2535 for 21 days. Then, these cells were exposed to
different concentrations of gemcitabine for 48 h. Cell proliferation
index was accessed by WST-1 assay. We found that the sensitivity
to gemcitabine was significantly increased after miR-200 reexpression compared with control cells (Fig. 5C). The cells transfected
with miR-200b showed 20.8% to 38.2% more inhibition compared
with control. The pretreatment of MiaPaCa-2 cells with B-DIM or
G2535 also increased the sensitivity of MiaPaCa-2 cells to gemcitabine. The cell proliferation rate of MiaPaCa-2 cells treated with
500 nmol/L gemcitabine was 79.05% compared with untreated

control, whereas the rate was 67.39% or 65.56% on B-DIM or G2535
pretreatment, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). The MiaPaCa2 cells pretreated with B-DIM showed 14.8% to 17.4% more
inhibition compared with control, whereas the MiaPaCa-2 cells
pretreated with G2535 showed 15.4% to 17.1% more inhibition
(Supplementary Table S2). These results suggest that miR-200
reexpression and B-DIM or isoflavone treatment could partially
increase the sensitivity of gemcitabine-resistant cells to gemcitabine
possibly through miR-200–mediated reversal of EMT status.

Discussion
In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that EMT plays
important roles in the progression of cancer and is also responsible
for the resistant phenotype of cancer cells to conventional
chemotherapeutics. It is believed that the sensitivity of therapeutic
agents correlates with cell phenotype. The mesenchymal-type

cancer cells showed increased expression of genes that are involved
in the processes of invasion and metastasis, which are resistant to
conventional therapeutics, whereas the epithelial-type cancer cells
are less invasive and metastatic and found to be significantly more
susceptible to chemotherapeutics, suggesting that EMT decreases
the sensitivity of cancer cells to therapeutics and promotes cancer
cell invasion and metastasis (2). Further studies have shown that
EMT marker proteins including E-cadherin and vimentin could
serve as a determinant of epidermal growth factor receptor activity
in non–small cell lung cancer cells and that E-cadherin expression
was a novel biomarker predicting clinical positive activity of the
epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib in non–small
cell lung cancer patients (27). In our study, we found that
gemcitabine-resistant cells showed EMT characteristics including
elongated fibroblastoid shape, high expression of vimentin, and low
expression of E-cadherin. Taken together, these results suggest that
EMT plays critical roles in drug resistance to most conventional
therapeutics. It has been reported that EMT is associated with poor
survival in surgically resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma (28).
Therefore, the presence of EMT phenotypic cells in pancreatic
cancer could be one of the reasons that patients with pancreatic

cancer are typically drug-resistant, which contributes to high
mortality.
It has been shown that down-regulation or the loss in the
expression of miR-200 family is associated with EMT. Gregory and
colleagues have reported that all five members of the miR-200
family (miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429)
and miR-205 were significantly down-regulated in cells that had
undergone EMT process in response to transforming growth
factor-h (29). They also found that reexpression of the miR-200
family alone was sufficient to prevent transforming growth factorh–induced EMT. In our study, we found a similar phenomenon in
gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells. The gemcitabineresistant cells having EMT characteristics showed low expression
of miR-200 family. Interestingly, reexpression of miR-200 in
gemcitabine-resistant cells showed partial reversal of EMT
characteristics as documented by increased expression of Ecadherin and decreased expression of vimentin, ZEB1, and slug.
These results suggest that miR-200 family regulates the expression
of ZEB1, slug, E-cadherin, and vimentin and that the reexpression
of miR-200 could be useful for the reversal of EMT phenotype to
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition.

Regulation of miR-200 by B-DIM and Isoflavone

Figure 5. E-cadherin appears to distribute in the
cytoplasm closer to the cell membrane after B-DIM
or isoflavone treatment (A ). The morphology of
MiaPaCa-2 cells changed from fibroblastoid to
epithelial-like appearance after B-DIM or isoflavone
treatment (B ). Cell proliferation assay showed that
reexpression of miR-200b increased the sensitivity
of MiaPaCa-2 cells to gemcitabine (C ). DAPI,
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.

Both ZEB1 and slug are transcription factors that repress the
expression of E-cadherin (30, 31). It has also been shown that
ZEB1 is the target gene of miR-200 family (29, 31, 32). By binding
to 3¶-untranslated region of ZEB1 mRNA, miR-200 inhibits the
translation of ZEB1. Consistent with these findings, our results
showed decreased levels of ZEB1 and increased levels of E-cadherin
expression in miR-200–transfected gemcitabine-resistant cells,
suggesting that novel approaches by which miR-200 family could
be up-regulated would be a useful approach for the reversal of EMT
and thus would be useful for the reversal of the drug resistance
phenotype of pancreatic cancer cells. It has been found that the
expression of miR-200 is lost in invasive breast cancer cell lines
with mesenchymal phenotype and in regions of metaplastic breast
cancer specimens lacking E-cadherin (29), suggesting that the loss
of miR-200 expression could be a critical step in cancer progression. Further studies have shown that the ectopic expression of
miR-200 increased E-cadherin expression, altered cell morphology to
an epithelial phenotype, and reduced the in vitro motility of 4TO7
cells in migration assays (31), suggesting that the increase in miR200 could reverse EMT and inhibit cancer cell invasion and metastasis. In our present study, we found that B-DIM and isoflavone
could induce miR-200 expression, resulting in altered cellular morphology from mesenchymal-to-epithelial appearance and induced
E-cadherin distribution that is typically found in epithelial-like cells.

www.aacrjournals.org

These alterations by B-DIM and isoflavone could be responsible for
the inhibition of cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis that
was previously observed by our laboratory (33, 34).
The let-7 miRNA has been found to regulate cell proliferation
and differentiation. Importantly, recent studies have shown that
decreased let-7 expression is linked to increased tumorigenesis
and poor patient prognosis (18, 35). Because let-7 inhibits the
expression of multiple oncogenes, including ras, myc, HMGA2, etc.,
let-7 has been recognized as a tumor suppressor (20, 35). Moreover,
it has been found that let-7 could regulate ‘‘stemness’’ by repressing
self-renewal and promoting differentiation in both normal
development and cancer and that let-7 miRNAs are markedly
reduced in breast cancer–initiating cells and increased with
differentiation (35, 36), suggesting that let-7 could regulate cancer
stem cell and EMT. In our present study, we found that B-DIM and
isoflavone could significantly up-regulate the expression of let-7
family, suggesting that B-DIM and isoflavone could inhibit
pancreatic tumor progression by reversing EMT characteristics in
part due to the up-regulation of let-7; however, further mechanistic
studies are warranted for assessing the role of let-7 in the processes
of EMT in pancreatic cancer.
The successful treatment of pancreatic cancer is dependent on
the sensitivity of cancer cells to conventional therapeutic agents.
Because mesenchymal-type cancer cells are more resistant to

chemotherapeutic agents than epithelial-type cancer cells (2, 37),
the status of EMT characteristics must be reversed to overcome
drug resistance, which could lead to the sensitization of drugresistant cancer cells to conventional chemotherapeutic agents.
The results presented in this article showed, for the first time, that
the nontoxic ‘‘natural agents’’ such as B-DIM and isoflavone could
up-regulate the expression of miR-200 and let-7, which in turn
down-regulate the expression of ZEB1 resulting in the reversal of
EMT characteristics of gemcitabine-resistant cells. We also found
that the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine could
be partly increased after reexpression of miR-200 or prolong exposure
of gemcitabine-resistant cells to lower concentrations of either BDIM or isoflavone. It is important to note that B-DIM and isoflavone
showed differential effects on miRNA and EMT marker expression;
therefore, further studies could be done by using the combination of
B-DIM and isoflavone to reverse EMT and increase the sensitivity of
pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine. In conclusion, these exciting
results should provide incentives for further investigation and

optimization in establishing the mechanistic role of B-DIM and
isoflavone in the reversal of EMT characteristics and drug resistance
and their utility in the clinical setting for the treatment of pancreatic
cancer for which there is no effective and curative therapy.
