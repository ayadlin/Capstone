ABSTRACT
An essential role for Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in human cancer has been
established beyond doubt. At present, targeting Hh signaling has mainly been
investigated with SMO inhibitors. Unfortunately, resistance against currently used
SMO inhibitors has already been observed in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) patients.
Therefore, the use of Hh inhibitors targeting the signaling cascade more downstream
of SMO could represent a more promising strategy. Furthermore, besides the
classical canonical way of Hh signaling activation, non-canonical activation of the
GLI transcription factors by multiple important signaling pathways (e.g. MAPK,
PI3K, TGFβ) has also been described, pinpointing the importance of targeting the
transcription factors GLI1/2. The most promising agent in this context is probably
the GLI1/2 inhibitor GANT61 which has been investigated preclinically in numerous
tumor types in the last few years. In this review, the emerging role of Hh signaling in
cancer is critically evaluated focusing on the potential of targeting Hh signaling more
downstream of SMO, i.e. at the level of the GLI transcription factors. Furthermore,
the working mechanism and therapeutic potential of the most extensively studied GLI
inhibitor in human cancer, i.e. GANT61, is discussed in detail. In conclusion, GANT61
appears to be highly effective against human cancer cells and in xenograft mouse
models, targeting almost all of the classical hallmarks of cancer and could hence
represent a promising treatment option for human cancer.

INTRODUCTION

The Hh signaling pathway

In this review, the emerging role of Hedgehog (Hh)
signaling in cancer is critically evaluated focusing on
the potential of targeting Hh signaling as an anticancer
strategy. More specifically, the relevance of targeting Hh
signaling more downstream of Smoothened (SMO), i.e.
at the level of the glioma-associated oncogene homolog
(GLI) transcription factors, is highlighted. Furthermore,
the working mechanism and therapeutic potential of the
most extensively studied GLI-inhibitor in human cancer,
i.e. GANT61, is discussed in detail.

The Hh pathway, one of the major developmental
pathways, is a very complex signaling network comprising
both canonical and non-canonical signaling. Activation
of canonical Hh signaling occurs when one of the
ligands, i.e. Sonic (Shh), Desert (Dhh) or Indian (Ihh)
Hedgehog binds to its receptor Patched (PTCH). This
relieves the repression of SMO by PTCH and results
in the accumulation of SMO in the primary cilium.
Activated Smo in turn, facilitates the activation of the GLI
transcription factors which will translocate to the nucleus
and promote transcription of the Hh target genes. The GLI
family of transcription factors consists of three different
proteins (GLI1, GLI2 and GLI3), of which only GLI1 is

an exclusively full-length transcriptional activator. GLI3
and, to a lesser extent, GLI2 can be partially processed
into truncated repressor forms [1, 2]. The activation of
the GLI transcription factors is controlled by Suppressor
of Fused (SUFU) which is a key negative regulator of
Hh signaling activity. In the absence of ligand binding,
SUFU will directly bind the GLI proteins and inhibit their
translocation to the nucleus and thus prevent pathway
activation [3]. The anchorage of the GLI proteins in the
cytoplasm by SUFU will facilitate processing and/or
degradation of the GLI proteins and thereby inhibit Hh
signaling [4]. To date, numerous target genes have been
described, which are involved in feedback mechanisms
(e.g. HHIP, PTCH1, GLI1), cell cycle regulation (e.g.
CYCLIN D1/2), proliferation (e.g. PDGFR, MYC)
apoptosis (e.g. BCL2), angiogenesis (e.g. VEGF,
ANG1/2), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT; e.g.
MMP9, SNAIL) and self-renewal (e.g. NANOG, SOX2)
[5, 6], representing a broad spectrum of mechanisms
by which the Hh signaling pathway can be involved in
carcinogenesis.
Hh signaling can also be activated by non-canonical
signaling. Non-canonical Hh activation has been defined as
either ligand-independent Hh activation originating from
PTCH (Type I) and/or SMO (Type II), but independent
of GLI-mediated transcription [7, 8] or through direct
stimulation of the GLI transcription factors, independent
of PTCH/SMO signaling [6, 9, 10]. Multiple important
oncogenic pathways (e.g. PI3K, MAPK, Wnt, NF-κB and
TGFβ) have been shown to activate Hh signaling. More
specifically, PI3K, MAPK and TGFβ signaling induce
their effect, at least partially, through the activation of
the GLI1/2 transcription factors [11]. Moreover, crosstalk
with tumor suppressor genes (e.g. P53, PTEN) has also
been demonstrated [6, 9, 11], making this pathway a very
interesting target for cancer therapy.
In recent years, the Hh signaling pathway has
shown to be an essential key player in tumor initiation
and/or progression to more advanced tumor stages [1, 2,
12, 13]. At the moment, inappropriate Hh signaling has
been demonstrated in more than 30% of human cancers,
including basal cell carcinoma (BCC), medulloblastoma
(MB), melanoma, breast, prostate, lung, pancreatic,
cervical and ovarian cancer [14]. Inappropriate Hh
signaling has been ascribed to either ligand-dependent,
i.e. autocrine and/or paracrine signaling, or ligand
independent tumor cell intrinsic pathway activation due to
loss-of-function mutations in PTCH or SUFU and gain-offunction mutations in SHH, SMO or GLI1/2 [5, 15]. The
latter has mainly been observed in BCC and MB.

companies mainly focused on targeting SMO. Several
SMO inhibitors are currently being tested in clinical
trials for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. The
most extensively studied SMO inhibitor is cyclopamine
[16], a naturally occurring substance derived from
the plant Veratrum californicum, which demonstrated
high efficiency in preclinical studies, but failed clinical
development due to poor pharmacokinetic characteristics
(highly insoluble in water, poor chemical stability in
acidic conditions), low potency and associated toxicity
[17]. This led to the development of many small molecule
Hh pathway modulators with improved potency and
druggability, e.g. vismodegib (GDC-0449), IPI-926,
sonidegib (LDE-225), BMS-833923, PF-04449913 and
LY2940680. These SMO inhibitors seem to be highly
efficient in patients with tumors harboring activating
mutations in the Hh pathway, i.e. BCC and MB. In
2012, vismodegib has been approved for the treatment
of advanced BCC on the basis of a phase II clinical trial
with response rates of 30% and 43% in metastatic BCC
and locally advanced BCC respectively [18]. Currently,
sonidegib, BMS-833923 and IPI-926 have also proven
efficacy in BCC and MB [19, 20]. At present, (clinical)
investigations are ongoing to evaluate their efficacy in
ligand-dependent Hh activated cancer types. However,
these solid tumor types demonstrated little or no
responsiveness in early phase clinical trials [21].
Regrettably, acquired resistance against vismodegib
has already been reported in patients with advanced BCC
and MB [22, 23]. In a study by Chang et al. evaluating
re-growth in patients with BCC treated with continuous
vismodegib, 6 out of 28 patients patients developed at
least one tumor regrowth (mean time 56.4 weeks) while
on the drug treatment [24]. Acquired resistance to SMO
inhibition has been linked to distinct mechanisms, such
as mutations in SMO (e.g., D473H) [25], amplification
of the downstream transcription factor GLI2 [26] or upregulation of synergistic signals such as PI3K signaling
[27].
Possible solutions for these patients include (1)
second-generation SMO inhibitors with a different
mechanism of action that are still effective in vismodegibresistant patients (e.g. HhAntag), (2) Hh pathway
inhibitors more downstream of SMO (e.g. GANT58,
GANT61) and (3) combination strategies with other
molecular targeted therapies (e.g. PI3K, EGFR inhibitors),
ionizing radiation or chemotherapy [13, 28].
The most promising targets within the Hh signaling
pathway are by far the GLI transcription factors. First,
these molecules are most downstream of the signaling
pathway. Therefore, small molecules targeting the GLI
transcription factors will still be effective in tumors
harboring mutations in SMO or even more downstream
of SMO (e.g. SUFU). Second, non-canonical activation of
the GLI proteins occurs by several important oncogenic
pathways. The fact that the GLI transcription factors are

PTCH, but entails a different mechanism as known SMO
inhibitors [48]. The mechanism of action of this compound
is not completely understood, but is thought to be due
to inhibition of GLI-mediated transcription [49]. Other
natural compounds able to inhibit GLI transcription were
identified in a large-scale screen for inhibitors of GLI
transcription. Five compounds were shown to effectively
inhibit both GLI1- and GLI2-mediated transcription, i.e.
staurosporinone, zerumbone, arcyriaflavin C, physalin B
and physalin F [50]. Several synthetic agents have been
described to specifically target the GLI transcription
factors, each with a different mode of action, e.g. HPI1-4,
ATO, GANT58, GANT61, GlaB, JQ1 and I-BET151.
Targeting Hh signaling at the level of GLI1/2 can
be classified in four categories, as shown in Figure 1:
1) inhibition of GLI processing and its trafficking (posttranslational modifications), 2) inhibition of GLI-DNA
binding, 3) inhibition of transcriptional output, and 4)
indirect inhibition.

GLI1/2 AS EMERGING TARGETS FOR
CANCER THERAPY
Gli activation in tumors
The first indication of involvement of Hh signaling
in cancer came from a study by Kinzler et al., already
in 1987, identifying a gene that was more than 50-fold
amplified in malignant glioma. This gene was then named
after the tumor, i.e. glioma-associated oncogene homolog
1 (GLI1) [29]. Currently, overexpression of GLI1 has
been described in multiple other tumor types such as
MB [30], rhabdomyosarcoma [31, 32], prostate [33, 34],
biliary [35], breast [36-38], lung [39], colon [40, 41] and
bladder [42] cancer. Moreover, higher GLI1 expression is
associated with more advanced (and metastatic) tumors
[33, 35, 38].
Several studies have also demonstrated the
prognostic value of several Hh proteins in cancer patients.
Protein expression of SHH, PTCH and GLI1 were all
independent prognostic factors for both disease-free
survival and overall survival in patients with colon cancer
[40] and bladder cancer [42]. Fan et al. also demonstrated
that low GLI1 expression correlates with a longer
survival in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC) [43]. Another study by ten Haaf et al. showed that
GLI1 expression in breast cancer is associated with an
unfavorable overall survival [37]. Furthermore, Chung
et al. have observed that nuclear GLI1 expression is
associated with metastasis and poor survival in patients
with head-and-neck SCC after radiation treatment [44].
Since GLI1 is both a transcription factor and a target
gene of Hh signaling, GLI1 expression is often considered
as a measure for Hh signaling activity. Overexpression
of GLI1 can be the result of either ligand-dependent or
ligand-independent cell intrinsic Hh activation. Mutations
at any level of the signaling pathway (e.g. PTCH1,
SMO, SUFU) will result in an increased expression of
GLI1. Amplification of the GLI transcription factors has
only been described in a subset of tumor types, such as
glioblastoma, BCC and bladder cancer [29, 45, 46]

Inhibition of GLI processing and trafficking
The primary cilium plays an essential role in
the trafficking and posttranslational processing of the
GLI transcription factors. Appropriate ciliary function
is important for processing of both the repressor and
activator forms of GLI proteins. As depicted in Figure 1,
in the absence of Hh ligand, SMO is retained from the
primary cilium and therefore not able to activate the GLI
transcription factors. In this state, SUFU will bind the
GLI transcription factors and retain the GLI proteins to
the cytoplasm, thereby facilitating GLI processing. The
sequential phosphorylation of the GLI proteins by protein
kinase A (PKA), casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen
synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) targets the proteins to the
proteasome for (partial) degradation. GLI inhibition
can occur at different levels in the activation process of
the GLI transcription factors. Increased proteosomal
processing to their repressor forms, decreased processing
into transcriptional activators and reduced trafficking of
the GLI proteins are several mechanisms that will result in
inhibition of GLI transcriptional activity. Unlike GLI2 and
GLI3, GLI1 is not cleaved to a repressor form, but will
be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS).
In general, GLI1 protein levels are strictly controlled
to allow proper target gene transcription and prevent
inappropriate signaling activity. A study by Huntzicker
et al has shown that degradation of the GLI1 proteins
occurs quite rapidly and is controlled by two independent
destruction signals (degron DC and degron DN). Mutations
in one or both degrons resulted in the accumulation of
GLI1 proteins, which was significantly correlated with
an increased transcriptional activity, thereby contributing
to carcinogenesis [51]. Targeting the accumulation of the
GLI proteins might therefore also represent a promising
anticancer strategy.
A study by Hyman et al. describes four Hedgehog

Targeting Hh signaling at the level of GLI1/2
Currently, only a few GLI inhibitors have been
developed, whereas dozens of SMO inhibitors are on the
market of which several are under clinical investigation.
Both natural and synthetic GLI inhibitors have been
described [47]. Triazole itraconazole is a natural antifungal agent that inhibits Hh signaling downstream of

pathway inhibitors (HPIs) that are able to modulate
GLI activity each with a unique mechanism of action.
HPI-1 has been shown to increase the GLI repressor
level, likely through posttranslational processing (PKA
phosphorylation). HPI-2 and HPI-3 appeared to interfere
with the processing of GLI2 to its transcriptional activator
form. HPI-4 seemed to act on ciliogenesis, thereby
inhibiting the processing of GLI into their activator form
[52].
Recently, a novel role has been ascribed to the Tolllike receptor-7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist, imiquimod (IMQ),
which has been approved for the treatment of BCC. IMQ
negatively regulates Hh signaling in a PKA-dependent
manner. More specifically, IMQ binds to adenosine
receptors (ADORAs) which activate PKA, resulting in
the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of GLI1
[53, 54]. In this context, other molecules that stimulate
ADORA/PKA signaling could represent a new class of

anticancer therapy by repressing Hh signaling.
Arsenic trioxide (ATO), currently used for the
treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), has
been demonstrated as a potent and specific inhibitor of
Hh signaling. Kim et al. demonstrated that ATO inhibits
GLI2 trafficking in and out the primary cilium, which is
necessary for appropriate GLI2 activation. This ultimately
results in a blockage of GLI2 accumulation in the primary
cilium and subsequently destabilization of GLI2, which
leads to a decreased level of GLI2 after long term
treatment with ATO [55].
Inhibition through direct binding to GLI proteins
The GLI proteins belong to the family of zinc
finger proteins, one of the most important families of
DNA-binding proteins. The GLI protein consists of five
zinc finger proteins of which only finger 1 does not make
contact with the DNA. Zinc fingers 2 to 5 bind the major

the activation process of GLI transcriptional output: 1a. Increased proteosomal processing of GLI2 into repressor form or GLI1 degradation
with HPI-1 or IMQ. 1b. Inhibition of GLI processing into its activator form by HPI-2/3, 1c. Inhibition of ciliogenesis and therefore
processing into the activator form with HPI-4, 1d. Inhibition of GLI2 ciliary accumulation and thus activation of of GLI2 by ATO. 2.

groove and wrap around the DNA helix. More specifically,
zinc finger 2 and 3 are believed to mainly bind the DNA
backbone whereas finger 4 and 5 directly make contact
with the DNA base pairs [56, 57].
The first small molecules that were identified as Hh
signaling inhibitors at the level of the GLI transcription
factors were GANT58 and GANT61 (Gli-ANTagonist)
[58]. Agyeman et al. have demonstrated that GANT61
directly binds GLI1 in a groove between zinc finger 2 and
3, which is not in the DNA binding region of GLI1, but
this interaction does result in an inhibition of GLI-DNA
binding and therefore GLI-mediated transcription [59].
The specific mechanism of action and therapeutic potential
of GANT61 will be discussed in more detail below.
A recent study from Infante et al. describes a
new GLI inhibitor Glabrescione B (GlaB) which also
interferes with the interaction between GLI1 and DNA,
but at the interface between zinc fingers 4 and 5, which are
responsible for the interaction between GLI1-DNA [60].

regarded as “indirect” inhibitors of Hh signaling.
Furthermore, one potential mechanism of resistance
against SMO inhibitors has been ascribed to an increased
activity of PI3K signaling. Simultaneous inhibition of both
pathways has been demonstrated to significantly delay
the development of resistance [27]. Moreover, a study by
Wang et al. describes a link between mTOR signaling and
GLI1 activity. Activated mTOR signaling resulted in an
increased transcriptional activity and oncogenic function
of GLI1. Simultaneous inhibition of mTOR (RAD-001)
and Hh signaling (GDC-0449) resulted in an additional
tumor growth inhibition in vivo in an esophageal xenograft
mouse model compared to either single drug treatment
[64].

GANT61
In a cell-based screen for small molecule inhibitors
of GLI-mediated transcription, Lauth et al. discovered
GANT58 and GANT61 to selectively inhibit both
GLI1 and GLI2-mediated gene transactivation. Both
inhibitors caused significant inhibition of tumor growth,
but GANT61 was shown to be more efficient [58]. This
prompted further investigation of this agent and resulted
in the publication of several preclinical studies performed
in numerous cancer types, including rhabdomyosarcoma,
neuroblastoma, leukemia, colon, pancreas, prostate,
cervix, melanoma, lung, head-and-neck and gastric cancer.
In this part of the review, we will summarize the findings
of these studies, especially regarding the different target
sites and therapeutic potential of GANT61 in human
cancer to gain more insight into the exact working
mechanisms of this agent.
The specificity of GANT61 to inhibit GLI-mediated
transcription has been shown in multiple studies and, as
stated above, was first described by Lauth et al. [58].
GANT61 has been demonstrated to decrease both gene
and protein expression of the target genes GLI1 and
PTCH1 and to reduce also the transcriptional output using
GLI reporter assays in multiple cell types [58, 65-68].
Until recently, little was known about the exact
working mechanism of GANT61. Then, Agyeman et
al. investigated the mode of binding of GANT61 to the
GLI transcription factors. By means of computational
modeling, the authors showed that the biological activity
of GANT61 is through direct binding to GLI1, in close
proximity to, but independent of the DNA binding region
of GLI1. GANT61 binds GLI1 in a groove between zinc
finger 2 and 3 and has binding sites at amino acids E119
(1H bond) and E167 (2H bonds). Mutations in these two
binding sites resulted in a significant inhibition of binding
between GANT61 and GLI1, confirming the interaction
between both molecules. Moreover, most of the amino
acid residues within 3.5Ǻ of GANT61 appeared to be
conserved between GLI1 and GLI2, which could explain
the inhibitory effect of GANT61 also on GLI2-mediated

Inhibition of Hh transcriptional output through
epigenetic silencing
Two recent studies identified bromodomain and
extra terminal (BET) proteins, and more specifically
BRD4 proteins, as critical epigenetic regulators of Hh
transcriptional output. BRD4 directly binds GLI1 and
GLI2 promoters, thereby epigenetically regulating GLI
transcription. In the first study, Tang et al. described the
potential of JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor, as an effective agent
against Hh activity. Tumor growth was significantly
attenuated in several tumor models with constitutive
Hh pathway activation, even with resistance to SMO
inhibitors [61]. In the second study, Long et al. performed
a small molecule screen for epigenetic modulators against
Hh signaling activity and identified the BET inhibitor,
I-BET151 to effectively attenuate Hh activity, also through
BRD4 inhibition. Treatment with I-BET151 also led to
a decrease in tumor growth in an Hh-driven MB mouse
model [62].
These studies provide evidence that targeting the
BET bromodomain proteins, especially BRD4 inhibitors,
could represent a promising future strategy to target
Hh-driven tumors and could be effective in tumor cells
harboring mutations in SMO or even more downstream
of SMO. However, in addition to its antitumor effects,
JQ1 has also shown to have an effect on several other
important physiological and pathological processes like
spermatogenesis, inflammation and cardiovascular disease
[63]. Therefore, more investigation into the exact role of
BRD4 inhibition in human cancer and potential toxicities
due to multiple targeting is needed.
Indirect inhibition of GLI transcription factors
As stated above, the GLI transcription factors are
modulated by several important oncogenic pathways, such
as PI3K, TGFβ and MAPK signaling [10]. Consequently,
targeted agents against these pathways could also be

The cytotoxic effect of GANT61 has been
investigated in numerous cancer cell types, with IC50
values ranging from 5µM-15µM after 48h-72h in most
cancer cell lines (Table 1). In cell lines known to be
independent of GLI signaling, higher concentrations
ranging up to 90µM were needed to cause any significant
cytotoxicity, probably rather due to nonspecific toxicity
of the high dose of drug or diluent (i.e. ethanol or
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)).

function to protect the chromosomes from recombination,
degradation and end-to-end fusion [69]. With every
DNA replication cycle, the telomeres are shortened
since DNA polymerase is unable to fully copy the ends
of telomeric DNA in the absence of a template strand
(‘end-replication effect’). When the telomeres become
critically shortened, they fail to protect the chromosomal
ends resulting in irreversible growth arrest and replicative
senescence. Telomerase prohibits this telomere shortening
by catalyzing de novo synthesis of telomeric DNA after
cell division and aberrant activation of telomerase has
been implicated in carcinogenesis [70]. The expression
level of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT),
a catalytic subunit bearing the enzymatic activity of
telomerase, is considered the rate-limiting determinant
of human telomerase activity [71]. Many factors have
been implicated in the regulation of hTERT in cancer
and normal cells, including Wnt signaling, c-Myc, HIF1 and p53 [72-75]. In a recent paper, Mazumdar et al.
have shown that Hh signaling transcriptionally regulates
hTERT in colon, prostate and brain cancer cells, but
not in the non-malignant 293T cells. Inhibition with
GANT61 reduced hTERT protein and mRNA expression
by preventing the binding of GLI1/2 with the hTERT
promotor in human colon cells [76]. Thus, GANT61 can
decrease the proliferative potential of cancer cells through
interference with hTERT activity. Another mechanism by
which GANT61 inhibits proliferation is by its effects on

Working mechanisms of GANT61 in human
cancer cells
The next part of this review summarizes the main
effects of GANT61 treatment, illustrating that GANT61
targets many of the “classical hallmarks of cancer”,
such as cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, DNA
damage repair, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
autophagy, cancer stem cells and immune response (Figure
2).
Limitless replicative potential
An unlimited replicative potential is one of the
most important hallmarks of cancer. Normal somatic cells
have a limited potential to replicate due to the shortening
of the telomeres, which are heterochromatic structures
located at the ends of the chromosome and mainly

cell cycle progression. Several independent studies have
shown that GANT61 induces a G1 arrest, consistent with
decreased protein levels of the Hh target gene Cyclin D,
which is a driver for the progression from G1 to S phase
[67, 77, 78]. Moreover, GANT61 induced the expression
of p21, which also inhibits cell cycle progression [76, 77].

partially rescued the GANT61-induced cytotoxicity. This
indicates that GANT61-induced cytotoxicity can be, at
least partially, ascribed to effects on cell death.
A recent study by Lim et al. described a novel
mechanism for GANT61-induced apoptosis in malignant
mesothelioma cells. Induction of apoptosis by GANT61
was shown to be dependent on the production of
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), but
independent of GLI1 or GLI2. Moreover, down-regulation
of GLI1, GLI2 and PTCH gene levels by GANT61
was also shown to be mediated by ROS and could be
counteracted by the addition of anti-oxidants, indicating
that GANT61 at least partially acts through the induction
of oxidative stress [82].

Apoptosis
Cytotoxicity of GANT61 has frequently been
associated with increased cell death rather than a direct
effect on cell proliferation. Inhibition of Hh signaling
can cause apoptosis either through activation of Fas
signaling or through decreasing protein levels of the
anti-apoptotic Bcl2, which is one of the target genes
of Hh signaling. Multiple independent studies have
demonstrated that GANT61 induces cell death through
both mechanisms. On the one hand, GANT61 induced Fas
signaling, characterized by increased protein levels of Fas,
cleaved caspase 3, cleaved PARP [67, 79, 80] and death
receptor 5 (DR5). PDGFRα levels were decreased after
GANT61, which potentially contributed to the increase
of Fas-mediated apoptosis, since PDGFRα regulates
Fas expression [68, 81]. On the other hand, GANT61
also decreased protein levels of Bcl2, contributing to
its extensive apoptotic effect in cancer cells [68, 81].
Moreover, overexpression of a double-negative FADD
(Fas-associated death domain) protein to abrogate Fas/
DR5-mediated death receptor signaling and/or Bcl2

DNA damage repair
GANT61-induced cytotoxicity can also be ascribed
to its inhibitory effect on DNA damage repair. Mazumdar
et al. demonstrated that GANT61 was able to induce DNA
double strand breaks (DSBs) marked by γH2AX, an ATMdependent DNA damage response mechanism. Activation
of ATM (p-ATM) and Chk2 (p-Chk2) was already shown
4h after incubation. The latter resulted in the induction
of DSBs and ultimately led to the induction of apoptosis
after 24h-48h. No effect of GANT61 was observed on
the ATR/Chk1 axis [83]. In addition, Shi and colleagues
performed a cDNA microarray of 18,401 genes to identify
differentially expressed genes after GANT61 treatment in

expression of several molecules involved in the DNA

treatment [84].

with GANT61 attenuated induction of EMT by TGFβ
[90]. Furthermore, another study indicated that invasion
and EMT in pancreatic cancer cells is regulated by SDF1/CXCR4 signaling, which non-canonically activates Hh
signaling in a SMO-dependent manner. Inhibition of Hh
signaling through cyclopamine or GLI silencing blocked
this SDF-1/CXCR4-mediated invasiveness [91].
Hypoxia also plays an important role in EMT
and invasion. Work from Lei et al. has shown this is, at
least partially, through activation of GLI1 by hypoxia.
Knockdown of GLI1 did not have an effect on hypoxiainduced HIF1α expression, but completely eliminated the
hypoxia-induced vimentin and E-cadherin expression and
tumor cell invasiveness [92, 93].
The effect of GANT61 on migration and invasion
has been investigated in multiple studies. As expected,
GANT61 has been shown to slow down cell migration and
thus to decrease cell motility [78, 80, 94]. Furthermore,
Fu and colleagues have also demonstrated that this is
correlated with a decreased expression of the EMT
markers Snail, Slug and Zeb1 in pancreatic cancer cells
[68]. Inhibition of GLI signaling by means of GANT61
could hence be a promising target to decrease tumor cell
motility and invasiveness.

Migration
Hh signaling is known to be implicated in epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) and therefore also in
the initiation of metastasis. Fan et al. demonstrated
upregulation of SHH, GLI1 and MMP9 and downregulation of E-cadherin in oral SCC tissue compared
to normal tissue [43]. In addition, a negative correlation
between GLI1 and E-cadherin was described in several
studies [43, 85, 86]. Contrary, Joost et al. have shown
that low GLI1 levels promote EMT in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma cells. Moreover, they also demonstrated
that GLI1 directly regulates E-cadherin levels through
binding with its promotor (CDH1) [87]. Chen et al. found
that downregulation of GLI1 expression significantly
suppressed adhesion, motility, migration, and invasion of
hepatocellular carcinoma cells, which was correlated with
reduced expression of MMP2 and MMP9, upregulation of
E-cadherin, and concomitant down-regulation of Snail and
Vimentin; all consistent with EMT inhibition [86].
Non-canonical Hh signaling has also been
implicated in EMT regulation. Xu et al. describe an EMT
molecular network mediated by Hh signaling in pancreatic
cancer cells. Their data show that GLI1 signaling
promotes EMT by inducing a complex signaling network
including TGFβ, PI3K, RAS and Wnt signaling [88].
Also, Ke et al. demonstrated that GLI1 promotes EMT,
invasion and migration in ovarian cancer cells through
crosstalk with PI3K signaling [89]. A recent study by Li
et al. has shown that GLI1 regulates TGFβ-induced EMT
in non-small cell lung cancer cells. Inhibition of GLI1

Cancer stem cells
Several studies have indicated that Hh signaling
plays a key role in the regulation of cancer stem cells
(CSCs), by controlling the transcription of a number of
genes implicated in cell fate determination and stemness
features, i.e. self-renewal and pluripotency [68, 95-97].
Work of Santini et al. has shown that melanomas contain
a subpopulation of cells expressing high ALDH activity
(ALDHhigh), which is correlated with a higher ability to
self-renew and tumorigenicity. GANT61 significantly

reduced the number and self-renewal capacity of these
melanoma CSCs and also decreased tumor initiation
in vivo [96]. Similarly, a study by Heiden et al. showed
that inhibition of GLI1 significantly reduced the number
of ALDHhigh thyroid CSCs. Overexpression of GLI1
on the other hand increased the number and the selfrenewal of these cells [97]. Furthermore, silencing of
SOX2 in melanoma CSCs also decreased self-renewal
in vitro and limited in vivo tumor initiation and growth
of melanoma stem cells. Hh signaling directly regulates
SOX2 transcription through direct binding of the GLI
transcription factors in the promotor region of SOX2,
indicating that the effect of GANT61 is at least partially
mediated by SOX2 [98]. This is in line with another study
by Fu et al. in which the authors have demonstrated that
GANT61 significantly decreases protein levels of several
markers of self-renewal such as SOX2, NANOG, OCT4
and cMYC. Moreover, GANT61 inhibited pancreatic CSC
tumor growth in NOD/SCID IL2Rγ null mice [68].
It is well known that CSCs are more resistant
to chemo- and radiotherapy [99, 100]. The use of Hh
inhibition in combination with chemotherapeutics could
be a promising strategy. Indeed, GANT61 has been
shown to potentiate the effect of chemotherapeutics in
neuroblastoma cells [67] and biliary tract cancer cells
[35] in an additive and/or synergistic manner. In a model
of alternating therapies proposed by Blagoskonny [101],
Hh-dependent cancer cells could first be targeted with Hh
inhibitors. Over time, acquired resistance to these drugs
may occur, as has already been observed with the use of
vismodegib in BCC patients. Since the relapsed tumor will
still be dependent on universally-vital targets, it can then
be targeted with chemotherapeutics. As chemotherapy
preferentially kills proliferating cells, it may spare CSC
that are driven by embryonic/stem pathways such as the
Hh signaling. Moreover, resistance against chemotherapy
has often been associated with an upregulation of
developmental pathways, such as Hh, Wnt and Notch
signaling [102]. Therefore, once chemoresistance has
occurred, the relapsed tumor might be sensitive to Hh
inhibitors again. Next to that, GANT61 could also be
an attractive target to sensitize radioresistant CSCs to
radiation treatment, as it has been shown that knockdown
of SHH or GLI significantly reduced clonogenic survival,
while expression of GLI1 was correlated with the number
of surviving colonies after ionizing radiation [97].

Little is known about the role of Hh signaling
in the immune response. A study by Yoshimoto et al.
illustrated that GANT61 increased the production of the
inflammatory cytokines IL8 and MCP1, thereby increasing
monocyte recruitment in CT26 colon cancer cells.
Activation of Hh signaling appeared thus to be associated
with an anti-inflammatory effect in colon cancer cells
[105].

Therapeutic potential of GANT61 in animal
models
Besides the promising results of GANT61 in in vitro
studies, also several animal studies have shown significant
decreases in tumor growth upon GANT61 treatment
(Table 2) [58, 67, 68, 77, 79, 104, 106]. Lauth et al. even
reported complete tumor regression in a 22Rv1 prostate
cancer xenograft mouse model. Treatment with GANT61
significantly decreased BrdU incorporation and increased
apoptosis in these tumor compared to controls [58].
These promising results highlight the potential of
targeting Hh signaling at the level of the GLI transcription
factors. The observed effect on tumor growth does
not seem to be dependent on the administration route,
since several types of drug delivery (intra-peritoneal
injection, subcutaneous injection or orally) have been
used, all resulting in a significant growth delay. None
of these studies reported any toxicity due to GANT61
treatment; however, there is little/no knowledge on the
pharmacokinetics (e.g. solubility, metabolism, etc.) of this
agent.

Combined modality treatment
As already indicated for a few times, the Hh
signaling interacts with multiple signaling pathways at
several levels of the signaling cascade. Most important
pathways are the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/
mTOR, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
Notch signaling, which all interact at the level of the GLI
transcription factors, except for Notch which interferes
with the ligand SHH. Combined treatment modalities
could be useful to overcome or delay resistance frequently
observed after long-term treatment with a single agent such
as vismodegib or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Especially
the combination of Hh and PI3K signaling inhibition
could be beneficial, since one potential mechanism of
resistance against SMO inhibition has been ascribed to
upregulation of PI3K signaling. Combination of a PI3K
inhibitor (BKM120 or BEZ235) and SMO inhibitor
(LDE225) delayed the development of resistance in a MB
mouse model, although no effect was observed on tumor
growth [27]. This combination is currently under clinical

Autophagy
Several studies have shown that GANT61 induces
autophagy, contributing to decreased cell viability and
increased apoptosis. Inhibition of autophagy decreased
the GANT61-induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo
in hepatocellular and pancreatic cancer cells, highlighting
the role of autophagy in GANT61-induced cytotoxicity
[103, 104].

investigation in patients with advanced or metastatic BCC
(NCT02303041) and patients with advanced solid tumors
(NCT01576666).
Another promising combination strategy could be
the combination of an mTOR inhibitor and GANT61.
Two independent studies have already shown that this
combination is significantly more effective than either
single treatment. In the first study, Pan et al. have
demonstrated a synergistic effect of rapamycin and
GANT61 in myeloid leukemia cells [107]. The second
study by Srivastava et al. indicated that GANT61mediated cytotoxicity was significantly more pronounced
in combination with mTOR inhibitors emsirolimus
and rapamycin, but also in combination with the
chemotherapeutic agent vincristine in rhabdomyosarcoma
cells [77].
As mentioned earlier, combination of Hh inhibition
with radiotherapy might also be a promising strategy to
increase the sensitiveness of certain radioresistant types of
cancer. A very recent study by Zhou et al investigated the
role of GLI1 in radioresistance and found that GANT61
could increase radiosensitivity of renal cell carcinoma cells
through hampering of DNA damage repair. Moreover,
simultaneously targeting of GLI1 and HIF2α turned out to
be even more effective [108].

efficacy and the different mechanisms by which this
agent interacts with cancer cells. In conclusion, GANT61
appears to be highly effective against human cancer
cells and in xenograft mouse models, targeting almost
all of the classical hallmarks of cancer and could hence
represent a promising treatment option for human cancer.
However, the impact of GLI inhibition on other important
cancer mechanisms such as angiogenesis has not yet been
investigated and should be examined, since this would
have major implications for the future use of GANT61.
Additionally, at the moment there is little/no knowledge
on the pharmacokinetics (e.g. solubility, metabolism, etc.)
of this agent and its toxicity.

In recent years, the Hh signaling pathway has
proven to be an essential key player in tumor initiation
and/or progression to more advanced tumor stages.
Numerous SMO inhibitors are currently on the market of
which several are under clinical investigation. Initially,
SMO inhibitors seemed to be very efficient in ligandindependent tumor types, such as BCC and MB, but
unfortunately resistance against these agents has already
been observed. Moreover, the effect of SMO inhibitors
in other (ligand-dependent) types of cancer seems to be
very limited, highlighting the importance of identifying
new target sites. The most promising targets within the
Hh signaling pathway are by far the GLI transcription
factors for several reasons. First, these molecules are most
downstream of the signaling pathway, meaning that small
molecules targeting the GLI transcription factors will still
be effective in tumors harboring mutations in SMO or even
more downstream of SMO (e.g. SUFU). Additionally,
non-canonical activation of the GLI transcription factors
occurs by several important oncogenic pathways, which
would render these tumors insensitive to inhibitors more
upstream of the Hh signaling cascade. With this review,
we attempted to highlight the importance of targeting Hh
signaling more downstream of SMO, more specifically,
at the level of the GLI transcription factors. In the second
part of this review, we summarized currently published
data on the GLI1/2 inhibitor GANT61, underlining its
