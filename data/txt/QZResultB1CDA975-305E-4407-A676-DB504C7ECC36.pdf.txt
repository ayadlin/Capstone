Abstract
The contribution of microenvironment to tumor growth has important implications for optimizing
chemotherapeutic response and understanding the biology of recurrent tumors. In this study, we tested
the effects of locally administered topotecan on a rat model of glioblastoma that is induced by intracerebral
injection of PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor)-IRES (internal ribosome entry site)-GFP (green fluorescent
protein)–expressing retrovirus, treated the tumors by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of topotecan
(136 mmol/L) for 1, 4, or 7 days, and then characterized the effects on both the retrovirus-transformed tumor
cells (GFPþ cells) as well as the uninfected glial progenitor cells (GFP cells) that are recruited to the tumor.
Topotecan treatment reduced GFPþ cells about 10-fold and recruited progenitors by about 80-fold while
providing a significant survival advantage that improved with greater treatment duration. Regions of glial
progenitor ablation occurred corresponding to the anatomic distribution of topotecan as predicted by MRI of
a surrogate tracer. Histopathologic changes in recurrent tumors point to a decrease in recruitment, most
likely due to the chemotherapeutic ablation of the recruitable progenitor pool. Cancer Res; 71(11); 3963–71.

Introduction
Glioblastoma is the most common and most malignant
form of primary brain tumor in adults. Understanding the
contribution of the tumor microenvironment to glioma
growth and response to therapy could lead to novel therapeutic approaches. Most studies concerned with tumor microenvironment have focused on the tumor vasculature.
However, glioma cells diffusely infiltrate the brain and intermingle extensively with the surrounding brain tissue. Therefore, the microenvironment of gliomas contains a complex
mixture of entrapped and reactive cells. Prominent among
these are glial progenitors, which are widely distributed
throughout the brain and spinal cord and represent the largest
populations of cycling cells in the adult central nervous system

(1–4). Glial progenitors proliferate extensively in response to
brain injury (5, 6) and recent studies have suggested that they
also proliferate within gliomas and contribute to tumor
growth (7–11).
We have developed an animal model of glioblastoma that is
induced by selectively targeting adult glial progenitors to
overexpress platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) via stereotactic injection of PDGF-IRES-GFP (green fluorescent protein)
retrovirus into the subcortical white matter of adult rats (9).
This model has shown remarkable consistency, with 100% of
injected animals succumbing to tumor-induced morbidity
within 2 to 3 weeks. More importantly, these PDGF-driven
tumors recapitulate the cardinal histologic features of human
glioblastoma multiforme [(GBM) WHO IV] including a high
degree of proliferation (30% Ki67 labeling index), diffuse
invasiveness, glomeruloid vascular proliferation, and pseudopalisading necrosis. A compelling finding from this study was
that the PDGF-driven tumors are composed of both retrovirally infected cells and uninfected glial progenitors that were
"recruited" to participate in tumor formation through paracrine PDGF signaling. The recruited progenitors are highly
migratory and proliferative, suggesting that they contribute to
tumor growth and dispersion and are not merely entrapped
cells (9, 10). Furthermore, these features are observable clinically as we have shown that human primary glioma cells taken
directly from patients as well as from a PDGF-expressing
human glioma cell line are similarly capable of recruiting
host-derived glial progenitors when xenografted into immunocompromised rats (12).

In this model, the ability to distinguish between retrovirusinfected/tumor-initiating cells and uninfected/recruited progenitors on the basis of GFP expression provides a unique
opportunity to compare the effects of chemotherapy on these
2 cell populations. In this study, topotecan, a camptothecin
class inhibitor of topoisomerase I, was directly infused into the
tumor and surrounding brain through the interstitial space via
convection-enhanced delivery (CED; ref. 13). Topoisomerase I
causes a single-stranded DNA break and forms a "cleavable
complex" (14) thus relaxing the DNA supercoil. Topotecan
stabilizes the cleavable complex and, when a replication fork
meets the complex, an irreversible double-stranded break
occurs—the accumulation of which leads to S/G2-phase arrest
and apoptosis (15). The drug is lethal to cells that are undergoing DNA replication and appears to be specific for cells in Sphase (15–20). Topotecan is a good candidate for administration via CED because it does not cross the blood–brain
barrier particularly well (21) and is associated with doselimiting toxicity when given systemically. Our own previous
work with topotecan in an intracranial C6 model showed the
ability to safely achieve greater than 1,000-fold higher concentrations of topotecan in rat brain when delivered via CED
compared with systemic delivery (22).
We predicted that both the proliferative PDGF-producing
cells as well as the proliferative recruited glial progenitors in
our retroviral tumors would be susceptible to the drug's
activity. We further hypothesized that because topotecan
activity is cell-cycle dependent, prolonging CED of topotecan
would significantly decrease the number of residual cells from
both cell populations (i.e., infected and recruited) in a timedependent manner and thus lead to increased survival. Finally,
by analyzing tumors that recurred after treatment, we sought
to determine the relative contribution of tumor cells versus
recruited glial progenitors in the composition of recurrent
tumors.

Materials and Methods
Retrovirus production and stereotactic injections
The PDGF-IRES-GFP retrovirus was produced as previously
described (9). Viral titers were about 105 CFU (colony-forming
unit)/mL. Five microliters of viral suspension was injected
into the right frontal subcortical white matter (stereotactic
coordinates relative to bregma: 2 mm right, 2 mm rostral,
4 mm ventral) using a 10 mL syringe with a 32G needle
(Hamilton Company) at a rate of 0.2 mL/min. Electronic
syringe pumps were used for the injections (Stoelting). Two
minutes after injection, the needle was slowly retracted and
the incision primarily closed with nylon sutures.
Osmotic minipump implantation
Osmotic minipumps connected to an intracerebral infusion
cannula via a catheter (model 2ML1, Brain Infusion Kit 2;
Alzet) were prepared and filled with the desired infusate per
manufacturer's instructions. Pump volume was 2 mL with a
flow rate of 10 mL/h (complete infusion of contents over 7
days). Pumps contained either an isotonic solution of 136
mmol/L topotecan hydrochloride (LKT Labs) or PBS (Gibco).

Topotecan concentration was the maximum-tolerated dose
determined from preliminary experiments (data not shown).
At 7 days postinjection of PDGF retrovirus, animals were
anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and attached to a stereotactic
head frame as above. The previous incision was reopened and
a subcutaneous pocket was formed between the animal's
shoulder blades via blunt dissection. The pump body was
inserted into the pocket and the cannula slowly inserted with
a probe holder through the same burr hole used for virus
injection. The cannula was then secured to the skull with
cyanoacrylate glue. The incision was again primarily closed
with nylon sutures. Animals underwent an additional surgery
also under gas anesthesia for removal of the pump and
cannula apparatus.
Survival studies
Thirty-six animals were used for 2 separate survival studies.
In each experiment, there were 4 groups of 3 to 5 animals each.
Control animals received PBS by CED for a total duration of 7
days. Three treatment schedules for topotecan by CED were
used in separate groups of animals: 1 day, 4 days, and 7 days.
These animals were monitored daily for level of activity,
seizure, posturing, and nasal or periorbital hemorrhage. Animals were sacrificed following observation of any of the
aforementioned manifestations of tumor morbidity. Survival
data analysis was done via the Kaplan–Meier method with
statistical significance determined with a post hoc log-rank
test (Prism 4.0). Primary cell cultures of PDGF-driven tumors
were generated as previously described (23, 24).
Short-term studies
Immediate posttreatment histologic analyses were conducted on 32 tumor-bearing animals (2 independent experiments, n ¼ 14–18 per experiment). In these experiments,
animals received PBS or topotecan via CED for 1, 4, or 7 days
and were immediately sacrificed (n ¼ 2–3 per treatment
group, per time point). Also, a study of the regional distribution of PDGFR-aþ glial progenitors was conducted in 12 non–
tumor-bearing animals (2 independent experiments, n ¼ 3
untreated animals, n ¼ 3 topotecan CED  7 days per
experiment). The regional counts of PDGFR-aþ glial progenitors were also conducted on tumor-bearing animals that
received PBS via CED and topotecan via CED for 7 days.
Mean cell counts were analyzed via 1-way ANOVA with post
hoc test for linear trend and/or Student's t test depending on
the number of groups being compared (Prism 4.0). All counts
are expressed as mean  SEM.
MRI studies
MRI was done on 6 animals to determine the volume of
distribution achieved by CED of topotecan. Tumor-bearing
animals were implanted with osmotic minipumps as above
with the addition of gadodiamide (GE Healthcare; 1:100 dilution, 5 mmol/L final concentration) into the 136 mmol/L
topotecan solution. Animals received a 1- or 7-day infusion of
the gadodiamide/topotecan solution (n ¼ 3 per time point).
Mean distribution volume was determined by manual tracing
of T1-weighted hyperintense areas. Areas of hyperintensity

Chemotherapeutic Ablation of Glial Progenitors in Rat Glioma

Immunohistochemistry
Animals underwent intracardiac perfusion of 4% paraformaldehyde before brain harvesting. Hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) stains were done on 5-mm paraffin-embedded sections.
Immunofluorescence staining was conducted on 10-mm cryosections at the genu of the corpus callosum (<500 mm from
catheter site). Antibodies used were as follows: rabbit antiGFP (1:500; Invitrogen), sheep anti-GFP (1:200; AbD Serotec),
rabbit anti-Ki67 (1:1,000; Dako), mouse anti-phosphohistone 3
(Abcam), rabbit anti-PDGF receptor a (PDGFR-a; a kind gift
from William Stallcup, PhD, Burnham Institute for Medical
Research, La Jolla, CA), PDGFR-a (Cell Signaling), rabbit
antiactivated Caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-Olig2
(Millipore), rabbit anti-NG2 (Millipore), mouse anti-Nestin
(Millipore), rabbit anti-sox2 (Millipore), mouse anti–smooth
muscle actin (SMA; Dakocytomation), and the appropriate
secondary antibodies. Microscopy was done with an Eclipse
TE-2000 fluorescent microscope (Nikon) and images were
taken with Metamorph software (Molecular Devices). Cell
counts were conducted on 200 or 400 fields and expressed
as number of positive cells/hpf and percentage of total cells/
field, as determined by nuclear stains with Hoechst 33342
(Molecular Probes).

Results
Chronic CED of topotecan increases survival
Median survival of control (PBS) animals was 20 days
postinjection. Animals given 1 day of topotecan via CED
had a median survival of 23 days postinjection. Animals given
4 days of topotecan CED had a median survival of 31 days
postinjection. Seven days of topotecan CED increased median
survival to 54 days postinjection. The survival curves for all 3
treatment groups were statistically different from the control
curve (P < 0.05). The survival curve of 7-day treatment was
statistically different when compared to 1- and 4-day curves as
well (P < 0.05). Figure 1 shows Kaplan–Meier curves of a
representative survival study.
Chronic CED of topotecan ablates both tumor-initiating
cells and recruited glial progenitors
H&E stains of brains harvested immediately posttreatment (i.e., PBS vs. topotecan at 1, 4, and 7 days postimplantation of pumps) show apparent eradication of tumor cells
by topotecan treatment after 7 days of CED (Fig. 2).
However, immunofluorescence staining for the retroviral
GFP tag revealed the presence of a few residual tumor cells
(Fig. 3A).
In PBS-treated animals, the number of GFPþ cells as well as
PDGFR-aþ cells increased as the tumor grew in a timedependent manner (Fig. 3B). Mean  SEM GFPþ cells/hpf
increased from 8.00  3.28 at day 1 to 10.78  1.43 at day 4

Figure 1. Chronic CED of topotecan (topo) provides significant survival
advantage. Median survival of PBS-treated animals was 20 days
postinjection. Animals that received 1 day of topotecan CED had a median
survival of 23 days postinjection. Animals that received 4 days of treatment
had a median survival of 31 days postinjection. Animals that received
7 days of treatment had a median survival of 54 days postinjection. P
values shown are for comparisons of each curve to the control (log-rank
test). Each treatment curve was also statistically different from every other
treatment curve (P < 0.05).

and finally 28.89  4.10 at day 7. Means were statistically
different on 1-way ANOVA (P ¼ 0.0002) and significant on post
hoc test for linear trend (P < 0.0001). Mean PDGFR-aþ cells/
hpf increased from 73.89  32.80 at day 1 to 199.2  30.75 at
day 4, and finally to 257.3  11.93 at day 7. Means were
statistically different on ANOVA (P ¼ 0.0002) and significant
for linear trend (P < 0.0001).
The opposite effect was observed in topotecan-treated
animals (Fig. 3C). Mean GFPþ cells/hpf decreased from 9.78
 3.52 at day 1 to 1.33  0.65 at day 4, and to 1.00  0.73 at day
7. Means were statistically different (P ¼ 0.0103) and significant for linear trend (P ¼ 0.0071). Similarly, mean PDGFR-aþ
cells/hpf decreased with prolonged treatment from 79.89 
34.83 at day 1 to 10.89  4.93 at day 4, and to 0.11  0.11 at day
7. Means were statistically different (P ¼ 0.0212) and significant for linear trend (P ¼ 0.0105). Similar results were seen
when we stained the topotecan- and PBS-treated tumors for
the glial progenitor marker Olig2. As previously reported (9),
the tumors were predominantly composed of Olig2þ cells, and
7 days of CED caused a nearly complete ablation of the Olig2þ
population (74.0  6.03 cells/hpf for PBS treated vs. 0.167 
0.0882 cells/hpf for topotecan treated; P ¼ 0.0003; Supplementary Fig. 2S).
To further elucidate the mechanism by which topotecan is
ablating tumor cells, we measured the activated caspase-3
index in tumors treated for 7 days with CED of topotecan
versus PBS. The caspase-3 index increased about 8-fold from
(1.53%  0.491% cells/field in PBS-treated animals to 11.8 
0.536% cells/field) in topotecan-treated animals (P ¼ 0.001) as
shown in Supplementary Figure 2S. These results show that
topotecan is ablating tumor cells by inducing apoptosis, as
previously reported (25, 26).

Figure 4. Vd of gadodiamide/topotecan CED at 1 day was statistically similar to Vd at 7 days. A, heat maps of hyperintense gadolinium signal on
T1-weighted MRIs show the anatomic distribution of infusate at 1 day versus 7 days postinfusion in 3 planes (COR, coronal; AX, axial; SAG, sagittal). At 1 day,
the ipsilateral (right) frontal lobe is completely infiltrated with infusate. At 7 days, infusate has extended posteriorly into the ipsilateral parietal lobe and also
across the corpus callosum into the contralateral striatum. B, there was a slight increase in mean Vd between 1-day and 7-day postinfusion
(0.5044  0.0186 mL vs. 0.5566  0.0576 mL, respectively) but this was not statistically significant (P ¼ 0.4455).

(tumor initiating) and GFP/Olig2þ (recruited) cells due to a
24-hour dose–response treatment of topotecan (PBS control,
136, 13, and 1.3 mmol/L). The results indicated a statistically
significant drop in the number of cells in all cases (1-way
ANOVA; Supplementary Fig. S3B and Supplementary
Table S1). Similarly, treating the primary cultures with topotecan (136 mmol/L) caused a nearly complete ablation of
PDGFR-aþ cells including both the GFPþ and the GFP
subpopulations (Supplementary Fig. S3C).
To further characterize the immunophenotype of cells in
the PBS- and topotecan-treated brain tumors, we carried out
immunofluorescence with a panel of antibodies against glial
cell and progenitor cell markers (Olig2, NG2, Nestin, GFAP,
and Sox2) and proliferation markers (Ki67 and PHH3). In the
PBS-treated tumors, the vast majority of cells expressed
PDGFR-a (Fig 3), Olig2 (Supplementary Fig. S2A), NG2 (Supplementary Fig. S4A), Nestin (Supplementary Fig. S4C), and
Sox2 (Supplementary Fig. S4E), and approximately 30% of the
cells are Ki67þ (Supplementary Fig. S4G). Double immunofluorescence analysis with Olig2 and PHH3 (which selectively
labels cells in G2/M-phase of the cell cycle) showed that
virtually all proliferating cells were Olig2þ (Supplementary
Fig. S5A). These findings are consistent with our previously
published results (9, 10). The topotecan-treated tumors
showed a nearly complete loss of cells expressing glial progenitor markers, PDGFR-a (Fig. 3), Olig2þ (Supplementary
Fig. S2B), NG2 (Supplementary Fig. S4B), and cells expressing
proliferation markers Ki67 (Supplementary Fig. S4H) and
PHH3 (Supplementary Fig. S5B). There were a few NG2þ cells
which were closely aligned with blood vessels and coexpressed
SMA, indicating that they are pericytes (Supplementary
Fig. S5D). There were also some Nestinþ/Sox2þ cells scattered
around the treatment site. These cells coexpressed GFAP and
had the morphologic features of reactive astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. S6B and D).

Locoregional ablation of glial progenitors coincides
with the distribution of gadodiamide/topotecan
solution administered via CED
Mean Vd of gadodiamide/topotecan solution after 1 day of
CED was 0.50  0.03 mL and did not statistically differ from
7 days of CED at 0.55  0.10 mL (P ¼ 0.4455). At 7 days, more
infusate was detected caudal and contralateral (across the
corpus callosum) to the cannula site (Fig. 4). Knowing the
approximate anatomic distribution of drug solution, we then
measured the abundance of PDGFR-aþ cells in normal adult
rat brains in 3 separate regions as follows: the lateral white
matter on both sides of the brain as well as the midline of the
corpus callosum. Mean PDGFR-a indices (no. of positive cells/
hpf) in normal brain were as follows: left white matter ¼ 4.51
 0.70, corpus callosum ¼ 2.84  0.29, and right white matter
¼ 3.72  0.57. These means were not statistically different on
1-way ANOVA (P ¼ 0.1765). We subsequently measured
PDGFR-a indices in the same 3 regions in animals from 3
different experimental groups as follows: animals without
tumors given topotecan via CED, animals with tumors given
PBS via CED, and animals with tumors given topotecan via
CED. All animals received 7 days of CED, with pump implantation for tumor-bearing animals occurring at 7 days postinjection of PDGF-IRES-GFP retrovirus. Mean regional PDGFR-a
indices from each experimental group were then compared
with the mean indices from the corresponding regions of
nontreated adult brain using the Student's t test. Results show
that CED of topotecan significantly decreases the local
PDGFR-aþ glial progenitor population. Decreases in
PDGFR-a indices were seen in areas immediately proximal
to the infusion site in topotecan-treated versus control normal
brain (0.44  0.76 vs. 3.72  0.98; P < 0.05) and tumor-bearing
animals (0.07  0.13 vs. 94.82  7.89; P < 0.01). Furthermore,
this effect was seen at significant distances distally, up to the
region of the corpus callosum in topotecan-treated versus

Recurrent tumors contain fewer recruited progenitors
Consistent with our previous work (9), naive and PBStreated control tumors were largely composed of uninfected
glial progenitors and only about 20% of tumor cells expressed
detectable levels of GFP (Fig. 6A and C). In contrast, tumors
that recurred after 7 days of topotecan CED, contained a
higher proportion of cells that expressed GFP (Fig. 6B and D).
This was most pronounced in central areas of the recurrent
tumors, with some regions approaching 100% GFPþ cells. A
more heterogeneous mixture of GFPþ and GFP cells was
seen toward the infiltrative tumor boundary. Just as in naive
tumors, recurrent tumors were composed of PDGFR-a þ cells.
Histologically, recurrent tumors maintained their GBM-like
phenotype except for the presence of larger, more developed
tumor-associated vessels (Fig. 6E and F).

Discussion
By using a growth factor–driven glioma model, which
exhibits robust recruitment of endogenous glial progenitors
by tumor-initiating cells, we have been able to distinguish, for

the first time, the effects of chemotherapy on these 2 distinct
cell populations. Analysis of the initially infected cells
and their progeny (i.e., GFPþ cells) as well as the recruited
cells (i.e., GFP/PDGFR-aþ) reveals that both populations are
significantly decreased by topotecan CED in a time-dependent
manner. Even by the fourth day posttreatment, GFPþ
cells were decreased 10-fold and recruited cells were
decreased 8-fold. This statistically significant trend was continued through 7 days of treatment (Fig. 3B).
Administration of topotecan via CED produced a statistically significant survival advantage at all 3 tested durations. The magnitude of survival advantage steadily
increased in a time-dependent manner as well, with longer
treatment times associated with longer survival. It is not
surprising that increased duration of topotecan administration increases cytotoxic effects because the proportion of
cells cycling through S-phase (either tumor initiating or
recruited) presumably increases over time and topotecan
cytotoxicity is specific for cells in S-phase (18–20). None of
the topotecan-treated animals experienced morbidities
related to the pump implantation or drug administration
over the full 7-day course. The efficacy and safety of prolonged topotecan CED in these animals suggests that
chronic CED of topotecan may be a feasible treatment
modality for human glioma patients.

MRI analysis following CED of gadodiamide reveals that,
even at 1 day postinfusion, the Vd is sufficient to encompass
the main tumor mass (Supplementary Fig. S1). Although the
Vd was not statistically greater after 7 days of infusion,
gadodiamide distribution did shift anatomically to more
caudal regions as well as more extensively across the corpus
callosum to the contralateral side. This implies that steadystate distribution volume was achieved relatively early in
treatment. Because gadodiamide distribution is at least an
approximate surrogate for topotecan distribution, the MRI
scans also provide indirect support that topotecan concentrations were uniformly maintained at high levels throughout
the infusion period. Regional analysis of PDGFR-aþ glial
progenitor cell distribution compared with gadodiamide dis-

tribution on MRI confirms that topotecan was present in
concentrations that were toxic to glial progenitors. Nearly
complete ablation of PDGFR-aþ cells was observed at the site
of infusion and extended to the corpus callosum, whereas on
the side contralateral to treatment, PDGFR-a labeling indices
in white matter were statistically similar to normal brain.
Although CED of topotecan efficiently killed both the
tumor-initiating and recruited cell populations, all animals
in the survival studies eventually succumbed to tumor recurrence. Even with 7 days of treatment, rare residual GFPþ cells
could be identified through careful immediate posttreatment
histologic analysis. Consequently, recurrent tumors also contained GFPþ cells, indicating that tumor recurrence was
derived from the progeny of retrovirus-infected cells. In

recurrent tumors, however, entire regions were seen where
nearly 100% of cells were GFPþ. As we previously reported (9),
only about 20% of cells are GFPþ in the naive tumors and these
cells are widely distributed throughout the entire tumor mass.
Solid islands of GFPþ cells were most prominently located
within central core areas of recurrent tumor. Toward the
infiltrative tumor boundaries, however, increasing numbers of
recruited progenitors (i.e., GFP/PDGFR-aþ) were seen. This
pattern of GFP expression in recurrent tumors is consistent
with a marked reduction in the recruitable glial progenitor
pool within the zone of treatment, whereas the small number
of residual GFPþ cells surviving treatment continues to proliferate in a cell autonomous manner, thus forming a central
tumor core devoid of recruitment. As the tumor expands and
GFPþ cells once again begin to infiltrate the surrounding
normal tissue, populations of recruitable PDGF-responsive
progenitors that remained after treatment (because they were
outside the region of drug distribution) are induced to proliferate and contribute to the growing mass of tumor cells.
At present it is not known what effect the recruited progenitor population may have on tumor growth, survival, and
time to recurrence. It is possible that the recruited progenitors
have an inhibitory effect on the tumor cell population (28). For
example, the recruited progenitors may compete with the
bona fide glioma cells for resources such as oxygen or growth
factors or may even secrete factors that directly inhibit tumor
cell proliferation or survival. If so, topotecan-mediated ablation of the recruited progenitors may actually facilitate tumor
regrowth and shorten the time to recurrence.
The increased proportion of GFPþ cells in recurrent tumors
(at least regionally) not only points toward a decrease in the
recruitable progenitor pool but may also indicate selection for a
treatment-resistant phenotype. Perhaps these recurrent cells
have cell-cycle lengths that exceed 7 days, such that they never
entered S-phase during the treatment period, rendering them
insensitive to topotecan. Other mechanisms of resistance to
topoisomerase I inhibition by camptothecin class drugs have
also been reported including decreased enzyme expression (29–
32) or decreased enzyme activity (33, 34). In addition, we
observed that recurrent tumors had much more robust tumor
vasculature than naive tumors and that these recurrent vessels
were often found to be surrounding the islands of pure GFPþ
tumor cells. It would be of great interest to explore in future
studies whether these recurrent tumor cells as well as the
recurrent tumor environment have, in fact, been fundamentally
changed by treatment. It might also be useful to test treatment

modalities that combine CED of traditional cytotoxic drugs
(such as topotecan) with targeted antiangiogenic drugs. Phillips
and colleagues have reported, through microarray gene expression profiling, that recurrent tumors are characterized by a shift
from a proneural subtype to a more mesenchymal one (35).
Because our treatment regime efficiently and reproducibly
reduces tumor cells to a true residual population and does
not merely produce a treatment failure, our recurrent tumor
model is well suited to study tumor recurrence.
In summary, we have shown that topotecan delivered via
CED safely and effectively prolongs survival in our retroviral
tumor model with toxicity against both tumor-initiating and
recruited cells. Because topotecan is cell-cycle dependent,
extended administration of topotecan most likely increases
survival in a time-dependent manner by maintaining an
effective tissue concentration for a longer duration. Finally,
chemotherapeutic ablation of adult glial progenitors by CED
of topotecan is locoregional and results in recurrent tumors
with proportionally more tumor-initiating cells and fewer
recruited progenitors. Future efforts will elucidate the relationship of tumor composition to survival as well as the
potential cellular changes in recurrent tumors that result
from treatment.
