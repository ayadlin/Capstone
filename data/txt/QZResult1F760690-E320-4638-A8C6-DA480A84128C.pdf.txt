BACKGROUND: Virtually all patients with prostate cancer who receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)
will ultimately develop evidence of resistance to treatment. The prognosis for patients who develop metastatic castrate-resistant disease is reported to be poor, with overall survival historically estimated to be 24
to 36 months. The goal of the current study was to identify predictors of clinical disease progression in
patients with prostate cancer who were receiving ADT. METHODS: Of the 13,740 men with biopsy–proven
prostate cancer who were enrolled in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urological Research Endeavor
(CaPSURE) database from 1995 to 2007, 4003 men treated with ADT after diagnosis without evidence of
metastases at treatment initiation were identified. The primary endpoint was the development of bone metastasis. Clinical and pathologic characteristics were compared between patients who developed metastasis and those who did not using chi-square tests in a Cox proportional hazards regression model. RESULTS:
The mean age of the men in the cohort was 70 years (range, 39-94 years). One hundred ninety-one men
(4.8%) progressed to metastatic disease at a median of 18 months from the initiation of ADT (range, 1-139
months). On multivariate analyses, risk category (hazards ratio [HR], 2.58; P < .0001), percent of biopsies
positive >33% (HR, 3.36; P ¼ .003), age 65 years at diagnosis (HR, 2.11; P ¼ .001, and prostate–specific
antigen velocity on ADT (HR, 1.04; P < .001) were found to be significantly associated with the development of metastatic disease after ADT. CONCLUSIONS: Younger men with high–risk disease appear to have
worse prognosis than older men with similar disease. This, along with the other prognostic variables
established in the current study, may help identify candidates for clinical trials evaluating secondary treatC 2009 American Cancer

treatment for patients with advanced CaP. Although the
majority of patients will initially respond to this form of
therapy,2 most patients with advanced CaP who receive
ADT, if followed long enough, will develop evidence of
resistance (ie, castrate-resistant prostate cancer). Historically, overall survival rates in patients presenting with
symptomatic bone metastasis in whom ADT was initiated
was poor, with death occurring in the majority of patients
within 6 to 12 months.3 However, the current use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in population screening and
diagnosis has led to a downward stage migration in prostate cancer. In addition, the use of PSA in the detection of
disease recurrence and progression has led to a change in
the population receiving ADT, such that longer survival
times have been reported in more recent studies, likely
reflecting a lead time effect.4,5
The ability to predict which patients will ultimately
progress while receiving ADT would be of great value to
clinicians. This would help identify the population on
ADT at highest risk of disease progression who may be
candidates for clinical trials. Previous studies have found
that PSA kinetics were predictive of survival in patients
receiving ADT,4,6-9 but to our knowledge few studies
have assessed other clinical parameters. The Cancer of the
Prostate Strategic Urological Research Endeavor (CaPSURE) database provided an opportunity to evaluate
other potential clinical predictors of metastasis in the PSA
era. This primarily community-based database contains
information regarding CaP patients receiving all treatment modalities, including patient and disease characteristics.10 The objective of the current study was to identify
both clinical and pathologic predictors of clinical disease
progression (ie, development of bone metastasis) in
patients with prostate cancer who were receiving ADT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
CaPSURE is a longitudinal, observational registry of men
with biopsy–proven CaP and has been previously
described in depth.10,11 Briefly, urologists recruit patients
with newly diagnosed CaP and report complete clinic
data and follow-up information concerning diagnostic
tests and treatments. Patients are treated according to
standard practice, and are followed until death or withdrawal. At the time of our analysis, the database contained
information on 13,740 men from 1991 through 2007. At
Cancer

the time of our analysis, 29 urologic practices were contributing data to the registry, with an additional 11 sites
active earlier in the project. A total of 34 of these practices
were community based, 3 were university centers, and 3
were Veterans Affairs (VA) medical centers.
Of the patients included in the registry, we identified 5201 men who were treated with ADT at any point.
Seven hundred seventy-five patients had evidence of metastatic disease when ADT was initiated and therefore were
excluded from the study. To allow for adequate followup, patients diagnosed in the 2 years before our study (n
¼ 423) were also excluded, resulting in a cohort of 4003
patients (Table 1). There were 197,401 person–months
of follow-up for analysis. Year of diagnosis was 1991
through 1994 in 683 (17.1%) patients, 1995 through
1998 in 743 (18.6%) patients, 1999 through 2002 in
1694 (42.3%) patients, and 2003 through 2005 in 883
(22.1%) patients. The primary treatment modality was
radiotherapy in 1340 men (33%), radical prostatectomy
in 733 men (18%), and watchful waiting in 445 men
(11%). The remaining 1485 patients (37%) did not
receive local therapy for their disease because of limited
life expectancy, significant medical comorbidity, and/or
rapid disease progression.
For the purposes of the current study, we included
patients receiving any type of ADT (Table 1). The majority were treated with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist (n ¼ 2027; 51%), or an LHRH
agonist in combination with another modality (n ¼ 1477;
37%). Calculated time on ADT was defined as the earliest
start date, to the latest end date or the end of the study,
with the assumption made that therapy was continuous.
Patients were grouped into risk categories based on
preoperative disease characteristics (ie, PSA, clinical stage,
and biopsy Gleason score) using a modification of the
stratification system described by D’Amico et al,12 with
the difference being that clinical stage T2c was included
in the moderate–risk category in CaPSURE. Clinical staging was performed using the 1997 American Joint Committee on Cancer-International Union Against Cancer
(AJCC–UICC) system. Low-risk patients were defined as
having a PSA level 10 ng/mL, stage T1 or T2a disease,
and a Gleason sum 6. High–risk patients had a PSA
level >20 ng/mL, stage T3 disease, a Gleason sum 8,
or a primary Gleason grade 4. The moderate–risk category included all other patients. Concomitant medical

comorbidity was estimated and analyzed by simply adding
up the number of medical conditions recorded in the
database for each individual patient. For the purposes of
our analysis, tumor volume was macroscopically estimated by dividing the number of core needle biopsies positive for CaP by the total number of core needle biopsies
taken (expressed as a percentage). The median percentage
of core needle biopsies involved in the CaPSURE database
(ie, 33% or one-third of core needle biopsies involved)
was used to dichotomize patients, with 1432 (40%) men
considered to have low–volume disease (<33%) and
2127 (60%) men considered to have high–volume disease
4472

(33%). PSA nadir after the initiation of ADT was
defined as the first lowest value that preceded 3 consecutive PSA measurements without a decrease. Because there
had to be 4 PSA measures after the start of ADT to designate a nadir, this was only able to be assessed in a subset of
the original analysis dataset (n ¼ 1780). PSA velocity was
calculated using the least squares regression on at least 2
measures during ADT, and was able to be assessed in
1224 patients.
The primary endpoint of the study was the development of bone metastasis as indicated by positive bone scan
(n ¼ 84), irradiation to bone (n ¼ 10), or progression to
bone indicated on either the Clinic Visit Form (n ¼ 84)
or the Clinical TNM Staging Form (n ¼ 13). We performed a survival analysis using time ADT was initiated
to metastasis or censoring to estimate the hazards ratio of
the development of metastasis for various clinical or demographic explanatory variables. Other treatments combined with ADT (radical prostatectomy vs radiotherapy
vs no treatment), age (65 years vs <65 years), clinical
risk category at diagnosis (low vs moderate vs high), PSA
velocity on ADT, percentage of biopsies positive (<33%
vs 33%), body mass index (BMI) (<25 vs 25), race
(Caucasian vs African American vs other), and number of
comorbidities were compared between patients who
developed metastases and those who did not using chisquare tests in a Cox proportional hazards regression
model. We used backward stepwise selection to build the
best parsimonious model, with 5% significance required
for inclusion. We tested key assumptions of the proportional hazards model by measuring the effects of time dependent covariates. Metastasis-free survival was plotted
using Kaplan-Meier curves for patients without and with
risk factors found to be independent predictors of metastasis. The log-rank statistic was used to determine the differences between the curves. All analyses were performed
using SAS statistical software (version 9.1; SAS Institute
Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
The median follow-up in our cohort was 3.6 years (range,
1 month-15 years), with 197,401 person-months of follow-up available for analysis. The median length of time
receiving ADT was 123 days (4 months), with a range of
1 to 174 months. The median time from diagnosis to the

initiation of ADT was 42 days (range, 0-167 months).
There were 191 events for an incidence rate of 1 per 1073
person-months. The median time from primary treatment to the development of metastatic disease was 53
months (range, 0-172 months). Of those patients who
developed metastasis, 83 (43%) were still receiving ADT;
those who were taken off treatment developed metastases
at a median of 14 months after discontinuing ADT.
In univariate analysis, race (P ¼ .0415), risk category (P < .0001), percentage of biopsies positive (P <
.0001), age at diagnosis (P ¼ .0008), and PSA velocity (P
< .0001) were found to be significantly associated with
risk of bone metastasis (Table 2). Patients classified in the
race category of ‘‘other’’ had a greater risk of bone metastasis compared with African American patients, who in turn
had a greater risk than Caucasian patients. An increase in
1 risk category held a near 2-fold increase in risk of bone
metastasis compared with patients in the lower risk group.
Furthermore, men with 33% of the biopsy cores
involved and those aged <65 years are more likely to progress to metastatic disease. In the subset analysis, months
to PSA nadir after ADT was found to be significantly
inversely associated with progression to metastasis (hazards ratio [HR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [95% CI],
0.95-0.98 [P < .0001]).
In the multivariate analysis, the best parsimonious
model indicated that clinical risk group (P < .0001), percentage of biopsies positive (P < .0001), age at diagnosis

DISCUSSION
The CaPSURE database provided a rare opportunity to
identify clinical predictors of metastasis in patients diagnosed with CaP who were receiving ADT. This large database included community practices and academic
institutions, as well as VA hospitals, leading to a widely
varied study population and a greater external validity for
our study results.
Many previous studies have found PSA nadir4,6,7,9
and PSA doubling time4,8 to be predictors of PSA failure
and survival in patients receiving ADT. One study examining the natural history of patients with a rising PSA despite ADT found that a PSA level >10 ng/mL and PSA
velocity predicted shorter time to first bone metastasis.13
Similarly, the results of the current study indicated that
PSA velocity and time to PSA nadir were associated with
the development of bone metastasis. In addition, we
found clinical parameters present at the time of original
CaP diagnosis to be predictors of metastasis: age <65
years, high–risk category, and 33% of the biopsies positive. Although the association between risk category and
tumor volume was intuitive, it was not as clear why
younger patients would be more likely to progress than
their older counterparts. Lengths of follow-up in the 2
groups were not significantly different, eliminating this as
a potential explanation for this finding. One large epide4474

miologic study found that younger patients with CaP
were more likely to have aggressive disease, with an
advanced stage at diagnosis as well as poorly differentiated
tumors.14 However, other studies have failed to demonstrate this link between younger age at diagnosis and
worse outcome.15
We attempted to include PSA doubling as a variable
in our analysis because this had been shown by others to
be correlated with outcome in patients receiving ADT.4,79
However, this value was only able to be obtained in a
small subset of our original cohort (ie, 1441 patients). In
addition, although we were unable to demonstrate a correlation between PSA doubling time and metastasis, the
small numbers in the current study precluded us from
drawing any strong conclusions based on this result. We
were, however, able to include PSA velocity as a measure
of PSA kinetics in the analysis, and, as expected, this was
found to correlate strongly with prognosis in our patients.
The current study thus identifies clinical and pathologic characteristics present at the time of the initiation of
ADT that may help stratify patients by risk. Knowledge of
these clinical predictors also may help tailor follow-up for
these men. Furthermore, the identification of patients at
higher risk of prostate cancer progression may help identify potential candidates for clinical trials assessing
bisphosphonates or chemotherapeutic agents. However,
the findings of the current study need to be validated
before the clinical usefulness of these predictors can be
determined.
In contrast to early studies examining patients
receiving ADT, the current study is more contemporary,
allowing us to assess the clinical course of patients receiving this form of treatment in the PSA era. The use of PSA
in the detection of early disease recurrence has led to a significant change in this patient population. Even in the
group of patients with all 3 predictors of bone metastasis,
only 12% of patients developed clinical disease recurrence
at 5 years, emphasizing the indolent nature of most CaP
and/or the effectiveness of ADT in delaying disease progression. Similarly, a recent systematic review of patients
receiving ADT who were treated primarily with surgery,
radiotherapy, or hormones alone found significantly
higher 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates when
compared with previously published rates.16
To have an adequate enough sample to conduct a
meaningful analysis, we included all forms of ADT in the

current study. The effect of surgical castration on the development of metastases is unlikely to be the same as the
effect of antiandrogens or finasteride; however, the latter
2 comprised only a small fraction of the population
(<6%). Nearly 90% of patients were treated with an
LHRH agonist, either alone or in combination with
another modality (ie, antiandrogen or 5 a-reductase inhibitor). Furthermore, due to the limitations of the database, we were unable to discriminate between those who
received continuous as opposed to intermittent ADT.
Of interest, in our study sample, patients who
underwent local treatment with surgery or radiotherapy
had outcomes similar to those treated primarily with
ADT with respect to the development of bone metastasis.
The independent effect of treatment on the development
of bone metastasis was not found to be significant. This
likely reflects the poor prognostic features present in a
large proportion of the patients in the current study. In
fact, nearly half of the patients in the current study were
classified as high risk by the modified criteria of D’Amico
et al.12 It also suggests that clinical disease progression in
patients with prostate cancer depends more on disease factors (ie, clinical risk category and volume of disease) than
the primary treatment modality used. It remains to be
seen whether the effect of primary treatment will be found
to be significant with longer follow-up.
The limitations of the current study include those
common to all retrospective analyses. A sampling bias
may exist because the database only included information
regarding patients who consented to the CaPSURE study.
In addition, the subgroup of patients in which the PSA
nadir could be calculated may have differed from the
remaining patients. Finally, a limitation to the generalizeability of the current study findings is the low proportion
of African Americans in the study sample (ie, 13%).
Conclusions
Age, volume of disease, risk category, and PSA velocity
appear to be important predictors of clinical disease progression in patients with prostate cancer who are receiving
ADT. This suggests that younger men with high–risk disease have a worse prognosis than older men with similar
disease. The use of these prognostic variables may help
identify candidates for clinical trials evaluating secondary
treatments for patients with castrate-resistant disease.
