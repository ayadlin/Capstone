Abstract
FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors have shown
activity in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML). Secondary mutations in target kinases can cause
clinical resistance to therapeutic kinase inhibition. We have
previously shown that sensitivity toward tyrosine kinase
inhibitors varies between different activating FLT3 mutations.
We therefore intended to determine whether different FLT3
inhibitors would produce distinct profiles of secondary, FLT3
resistance mutations. Using a cell-based screening approach,
we generated FLT3–internal tandem duplication (ITD)–
expressing cell lines resistant to the FLT3 inhibitors SU5614,
PKC412, and sorafenib. Interestingly, the profile of resistance
mutations emerging with SU5614 was limited to exchanges in
the second part of the kinase domain (TK2) with exchanges of
D835 predominating. In contrast, PKC412 exclusively produced
mutations within tyrosine kinase domain 1 (TK1) at position
N676. A mutation at N676 recently has been reported in a case
of PKC412-resistant AML. TK1 mutations exhibited a differential response to SU5614, sorafenib, and sunitinib but strongly
impaired response to PKC412. TK2 exchanges identified with
SU5614 were sensitive to PKC412, sunitinib, or sorafenib, with
the exception of Y842D, which caused a strong resistance to
sorafenib. Of note, sorafenib also produced a highly distinct
profile of resistance mutations with no overlap to SU5614 or
PKC412, including F691L in TK1 and exchanges at position
Y842 of TK2. Thus, different FLT3 kinase inhibitors generate
distinct, nonoverlapping resistance profiles. This is in contrast
to Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, nilotinib, and
dasatinib, which display overlapping resistance profiles.
Therefore, combinations of FLT3 inhibitors may be useful to
prevent FLT3 resistance mutations in the setting of FLT3-ITD–
positive AML. [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):3032–41]

Introduction
The type III receptor tyrosine kinase FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3
(FLT3) constitutes a potentially attractive therapeutic target in
acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). FLT3 is overexpressed in most
patients with AML (1). In addition, activating FLT3 mutations can

be identified in approximately one-third of AML patients. Internal
tandem duplication (ITD) mutations within the juxtamembrane
domain are most common, whereas single-base point mutations,
small deletions, or insertions within the receptor tyrosine kinase
domain activation loop (FLT3-TKD) constitute the minority of
cases (2, 3). Both classes of mutations lead to constitutive
activation of the receptor and downstream signaling events in
the absence of ligand (4), and FLT3-ITDs induce a lethal
myeloproliferative disease in murine bone marrow transplantation
experiments (5). Small molecule inhibitors of FLT3 tyrosine kinase
such as PKC412 or CEP701 were shown to be effective in preclinical
models (6, 7) and showed activity in clinical trials (8, 9). However,
the majority of patients display primary or secondary resistance to
FLT3 inhibitors (8, 9), and a case of a patient with a FLT3-ITD
resistance mutation and AML resistant to PKC412 already has been
described (10). At this time, a growing number of FLT3 inhibitors
enter preclinical and clinical evaluation (11). For the indolinone
SU11248 (Sunitinib, Sutent), phase I data indicate clinical activity
in FLT3-mutated AML (12), and the biaryl urea BAY 43-9006
(Sorafenib, Nexavar) displayed promising FLT3 activity in vitro (13,
14), and recently entered clinical evaluation in FLT3 wild-type (wt)
and mutant AML (15). We have shown before that sensitivity
toward specific FLT3 kinase inhibitors varies between different
activating FLT3 mutations (14, 16). Therefore, we intended to
determine whether different FLT3 inhibitors on a FLT3-ITD
background would be prone to similar secondary mutations that
might cause clinical resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. Using an in vitro
resistance screening approach (17), we here show that the resulting
profiles of resistance mutations were largely nonoverlapping. This
in vitro data indicate that combinations of FLT3 inhibitors may be
beneficial to prevent resistance due to FLT3-ITD kinase domain
mutations in AML.

Materials and Methods
Inhibitors. PKC412 was a kind gift from Novartis Pharma AG. SU5614
was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Sorafenib was purchased
from American Chemicals Custom Corporation. Sunitinib was purchased
from a local pharmacy. Each compound was dissolved in DMSO to give a
10 mmol/L stock solution and stored at 20jC. Chemical structures of the
compounds are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.
Cell culture and DNA constructs. Ba/F3 cell lines expressing FLT3-ITD
constructs were established and maintained as described previously (14).

Mig EGFP FLT3-ITD wt cells were cultured
in 96-well plates in the presence of inhibitor
at the indicated concentrations. Resistant
colonies were picked and analyzed for
the presence of point mutations within the
FLT3-ITD kinase domain. Wild-type (open

occurred in FLT3-ITD TK1, SU5614
mutations were limited to TK2, and
sorafenib mutations came up at distinct
sites in TK1 and TK2 (D ). Three exchanges
at TK1 N676 were identified with PKC412,
nine exchanges affecting six different
positions in TK2 were identified in cell
clones resistant to SU5614, and
exchanges emerging with sorafenib
included F691L in TK1 and three different
exchanges at Y842 in TK2.

Resistance screen. Screening for inhibitor-resistant colonies was
performed as described previously (17). When indicated, Ba/F3 Mig
EGFP/FLT3-ITD cells were pretreated twice with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea
(ENU) for 8 h at a concentration of 100 Ag/mL. Thereafter, cells were
cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 4  105 per well in the presence of
PKC412 at 50 or 100 nmol/L, SU5614 at 750 or 1,500 nmol/L, and sorafenib
at 50, 100, 150, or 300 nmol/L. Culture supernatants were replaced by fresh
medium containing inhibitor after 48 h. Cell colonies that became visible
were picked, expanded, and analyzed. Resulting inhibitor-resistant sublines
were cultured in the presence of inhibitor at a concentration corresponding
to that used during the screen, except for sublines emerging in the presence
of PKC412 at 100 nmol/L, which were maintained in the presence of
PKC412 at 50 nmol/L.

Proliferation. Cell proliferation was measured using an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-[3-carboxymethoxyphenyl-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS)]-based method by absorption of formazan at 490 nm (CellTiter
96; Promega). Measures were taken in triplicates after 24 and 48 h of culture.
Western blot. Ba/F3 cells were cultured for 2.5 h without and in the
presence of inhibitor at the indicated concentrations. Cell lysis, SDS-PAGE,
and immunoblotting were done as described previously (17). Antibodies to
phospho-FLT3 (Tyr589/591) were obtained from Cell Signaling (clone 30D4;
New England Biolabs GmbH). FLT3 antibodies were purchased from
Upstate Biotechnology (#06-647; Millipore). Bands were visualized using the
enhanced chemoluminescence system (Amersham).
Structural modeling. The protein crystal structures3 were superimposed with alignment of a carbon positions with PyMOL4 using 1RJB
(18) as reference coordinate set. Inspections were performed and structure
figures were created with PyMOL.

Results
Screening for FLT3 TKI-resistant Ba/F3 clones reveals
distinct mutation profiles for SU5614 and PKC412. To generate
FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor–resistant cell lines, we cultured
Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells in 96-well plates in the presence of the FLT3
inhibitors PKC412, SU5614, or sorafenib. For the staurosporine
derivative PKC412, we used 50 and 100 nmol/L, corresponding to
6.25 and 12.5 times the cellular IC50 value in Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells.
At 50 nmol/L PKC412, 74 of 96 wells displayed growth, whereas at
100 nmol/L, only 20 of 96 wells were growing, corresponding to a
clone frequency of 1.93 and 0.52 per million cells input, respectively
(Fig. 1A). However, when we sequenced the entire FLT3-ITD kinase
domain for mutations that might have caused outgrowth of PKCresistant subclones, we were not able to detect point mutations in
any of these clones. We therefore pretreated Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells
with the mutagene ENU (19). Using these cells, we obtained 27
clones, and 4 of these displayed mutations (Fig. 1A). In all cases, the
resulting amino acid exchanges affected position N676 within the
first part of the FLT3 kinase domain (TK1), two clones with an
exchange to aspartic acid, one to isoleucine, and one to serine,
respectively (Fig. 1D). In accordance, an exchange at N676 to Lysine
has been described in a case of PKC412 resistant, FLT3-ITD–
positive AML (10). Of note, no mutations in TK2 were identified
in PKC412-resistant cell clones. We next intended to determine
whether a structurally different FLT3 inhibitor, the indolinone
derivative SU5614 would produce a similar or distinct profile of
resistance mutations. To this end, we cultured Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD
cells in the presence of SU5614 at 750 and 1500 nmol/L,
corresponding to 7.5 and 15 times the cellular IC50 value. Similar
to PKC412, low concentrations of the drug gave rise to a high
number of resistant clones with growth in 61 of 96 wells,
corresponding to a clone frequency of 1.59 per million cells input
(Fig. 1B). The yield of resistant clones decreased to 13 wells with
growth of 192 at 1,500 nmol/L, corresponding to 0.17 clones per
million cells. Pretreatment with ENU resulted in a substantial
increase of resistant clones: 179 of 192 wells displayed outgrowth,
the appendant clone frequency was as high as 2.33 compared with
0.17 without ENU pretreatment (Fig. 1B). Examination of FLT-ITD
for mutations giving rise to SU5614 resistance exclusively revealed
exchanges in TK2, and in contrast to PKC412, no TK1 exchanges
were identified. Although none of the 61 clones derived from the
SU5614 screen with 750 nmol/L contained mutations, 5 of 8 clones
at 1,500 nmol/L (without ENU) harbored 4 different exchanges at
positions S841, Y842, and D839 within the FLT3 activation loop,
respectively (Fig. 1C). Remarkably, in clones that emerged at
1,500 nmol/L SU5614 after ENU treatment, 127 of 179 clones (71%)
displayed mutations, generating 9 different exchanges affecting 6
positions in the activation loop. Exchanges of D835, in all but one
cell clone to glutamic acid predominated (65%), followed by M855T
(18%; Fig. 1D). Together, all exchanges that came up in the presence
of SU5614 comprised the narrow region from C828 to M855 in the
activation loop, whereas PKC412 exclusively produced exchanges
of position N676. Thus, these FLT3 inhibitors generated distinct,
nonoverlapping profiles of resistance mutations.
PKC412 and SU5614 display limited cross-resistance. We
went on to explore whether the marked difference in the resistance
profiles generated with PKC412 and SU5614 would be reflected by a
lack of cross resistance between both compounds with regard to
the exchanges that were detected in the respective screens. We
therefore cloned all identified FLT3-ITD mutations, generated
stable cell lines, and examined FLT3-ITD autophosphorylation and

cell growth in the presence of PKC412 and SU5614. TK1 exchanges
that emerged in the PKC412 screen induced an increase of cellular
IC50 values in the presence of PKC412 in the range of factor 3.1
(N676S) to factor 10 (N676D; Supplementary Fig. S2A, top; see
Table 1). This was accompanied by retained FLT3-ITD autophosphorylation in the presence of PKC412 (Fig. 2A). Two of three N676
exchanges identified in the presence of PKC412 also gave rise to a
significant SU5614 resistance (Supplementary Fig. S2A, bottom;
Table 1). Although the N676S exchange did not alter SU5614
response, the exchanges to isoleucine and aspartic acid shifted
IC50 values by a factor of 4 compared with FLT3-ITD wt cells. All
TK2 exchanges identified in SU5614-resistant clones shifted cellular
SU5614 response by factor 1.25 (S841C) to factor 5 (D835Y, Y842C;
see Supplementary Fig. S2B, top and Table 1). Again, protection
from growth suppression correlated well with persistent FLT3-ITD
autophosphorylation in the presence of SU5614 (Fig. 2B), confirming that the identified TK2 exchanges caused inhibitor resistance.
Interestingly, TK2 exchanges identified in the SU5614 screen only
marginally interfered with response to PKC412 (Supplementary
Fig. S2B, bottom; Table 1). Cellular IC50 values shifted at maximum
by a factor of 2.5 (D839G, M855T), whereas other exchanges
corresponded to FLT3-ITD wt (S841C, Y842N), or were even more
sensitive as wt cells (Y842C, Y842D, Y842H, Y842S).
Thus, although two of three PKC412 TK1 exchanges also were
resistant to SU5614, SU5614 TK2 mutations did not cause
significant cross-resistance to PKC412.
SU11248 and sorafenib are active against PKC412 and
SU5614-resistant FLT3-ITD mutations. Because the 3-substituted
indolinone SU5614 may not enter further clinical testing, we sought
to determine whether the structurally similar 3-substituted
indolinone SU11248 (sunitinib) would be active against the
identified PKC412 and SU5614 FLT3-ITD resistance mutants.
Compared with SU5614, SU11248 displayed a significantly
higher activity against all SU5614-resistant TK2 mutations
(Supplementary Fig. S2C, top; Table 1). In contrast, TK1 N676
exchanges identified in the PKC412 screen also caused some
decrease in sensitivity for SU11428 (Supplementary Fig. S2C,
bottom; Table 1). However, complete growth inhibition was
observed at 500 nmol/L. We next examined the biaryl urea
sorafenib, a structurally distinct FLT3 inhibitor that recently
entered clinical evaluation in FLT3 wt and mutant AML.
Interestingly, TK2 exchanges responded to sorafenib with the
exception of FLT3-ITD Y842D, which in contrast to Y842C or
neighboring exchanges in TK2 markedly shifted response to
sorafenib by a factor of 31 (Supplementary Fig. S2D, top; Table 1).
Also, the D839H exchange but not D839G affected sorafenib
response. Similar to SU11248, lower absolute inhibitory concentrations were necessary for complete growth suppression of N676
exchanges with sorafenib (125–500 nmol/L; see Supplementary Fig.
S2D, bottom) compared with SU5614 (500–2,000 nmol/L; Supplementary Fig. S2A, bottom).
Screening for sorafenib resistance reveals specific
exchanges at FLT3-ITD Y842 and F691. The finding that Y842D
but not Y842C or other TK2 exchanges caused a strong resistance
to sorafenib prompted us to search for sorafenib-specific resistance
mutations in FLT3-ITD. We therefore generated sorafenib-resistant
Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD sublines (Fig. 1C). With sorafenib at 100 and
150 nmol/L, corresponding to f13 and 19 times IC50 in FLT-ITD
wt cells, we discovered two exchanges at Y842 in TK2 (Y842H/N)
that did not match the exchanges previously identified with
SU5614 at the same site (Y842C/D; see Fig. 1D). However, when we

NOTE: Red, strong resistance; yellow, moderate resistance; green: no/weak, resistance. Exchanges identified in PKC412-, SU5614-, and sorafenib-resistant
sublines are indicated by bold frames. Mutations identified in the screens and FLT3-ITD F691I (21) were recreated in FLT3-ITD using site-directed
mutagenesis and expressed in Ba/F3 cells. After incubation for 24 and 48 h without and in the presence of SU5614, PKC412, SU11248, or sorafenib at the
indicated concentrations, proliferation was measured using an MTS-based method. At least two independent experiments were performed for each
FLT3-ITD construct. Representative results of one experiment per inhibitor and construct after 48 h of incubation are expressed as individual cellular
IC50 values and fold change IC50 of FLT3 wt–expressing Ba/F3 cells. Individual dose response is shown in detail in Supplementary Fig. 2. The extent of
cellular resistance is indicated as strong (red), yellow (moderate), and no/weak (green) with a cellular IC50 range for weak/moderate/strong of <12.5/12.5
to 24.9/z25 nmol/L for PKC412, and <250/250 to 499/z500 nmol/L for SU5614, SU11248, and sorafenib.

increased the concentration to 38 times IC50 (300 nmol/L), we
exclusively isolated F691L in TK1. To increase the yield of mutant
clones, we pretreated cells with ENU and again screened with
sorafenib at 150 and 500 nmol/L (Fig. 1C). At 150 nmol/L, all clones
contained FLT3-ITD Y842S, whereas at 300 nmol/L, all cell clones
harbored FLT3-ITD F691L. Thus, sorafenib displays a resistance
profile in FLT3-ITD distinct from PKC412 and SU5614 and
unlike these compounds, the emerging exchanges shift between
two distinct sites in TK1 and TK2, depending on the inhibitor
concentration. As expected, FLT3-ITD Y842H/N/S and F691L
profoundly attenuated cellular and biochemical response to
sorafenib 37.5- to >125-fold when cloned and expressed in Ba/F3
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2E, top; Table 1; Fig. 2C). Response to
SU5614 and SU11248 was also affected by these exchanges,
although both indolinone type inhibitors fully suppressed the
highly sorafenib-resistant F691L exchange at concentrations of
1,000 nmol/L (SU5614; Supplementary Fig. S2E, bottom) and
250 nmol/L (SU11248; Supplementary Fig. S2F, top). In addition,
SU11248 displayed significant activity against the highly sorafenibresistant Y842 exchanges, with complete growth inhibition at
500 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S2F, top). In marked contrast,
sorafenib resistance mutations did not affect PKC412 response
(Supplementary Fig. S2F, bottom; Table 1). Of interest, this was also
the case for F691L. Position F691 in FLT3-ITD corresponds to T315

in ABL (20), where an exchange to isoleucine causes a full and
complete resistance to imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib. An
exchange at F691 to isoleucine was previously identified by
in vitro mutagenesis of FLT3-ITD TK1 to cause PKC412 resistance
(21). In accord, F691I lead to a 18-fold mitigation of PKC412 drug
response (Supplementary Fig. S2F, bottom; Table 1; Fig. 2A), and
strongly affected response to sorafenib and SU5614 (Supplementary
Fig. S2E). Using SU11248 at 2,000 nmol/L resulted in nearly
complete suppression of F691I (Supplementary Fig. S2F, top).
Together, sorafenib screening identified a set of strong resistance
mutations in FLT3-ITD. Most of these exhibited partial crossresistance to SU5614 and SU11248 but were responsive to PKC412.
FLT3-ITD F691I was highly resistant to all compounds, although
complete growth inhibition was seen with high concentrations
of SU11248.
Structural analysis. Most positions in FLT3-ITD where we
identified exchanges in our inhibitor-resistant cell clones correspond to substitutions in related kinases linked to clinical imatinib
resistance, supporting the validity of our results (Supplementary
Table S1). The inhibitors generated distinct and nearly mutually
exclusive sets of resistance mutants (Table 1; Fig. 3). Moreover,
the resistance patterns, while overlapping, are unique for each
inhibitor. This highlights the different inhibition modes and/or
geometries of the inhibitors and suggests the use of combination or

inhibitor. FLT3-ITD variants identified in resistant
clones and FLT3-ITD F691I (21) were cloned. Parental
Ba/F3 cells were transformed with wt or mutant
constructs. Cells were treated for 2.5 h without and in
the presence of PKC412 (A ), SU5614 (B), or sorafenib
(C ) at the indicated concentrations. Whole cell lysates
were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed for
phosphoFLT3 (left ) and FLT3 (right ). The FLT3
antibody detected both the mature 155 kDa (cell
surface) and the immature 130 kDa (intracellular) form.
Due to the presence of the ITD, the phosphoFLT3
antibody mainly detected phosphorylation of the
immature form (48).

FLT3-ITD Resistance Profiles

Figure 3. Orthogonal views of the distribution of mutations in FLT3. PKC412 (cyan sticks ) induced mutations only at a single site N676 (cyan spheres ). Sorafenib
(green sticks ) induced mutations at the ‘‘gatekeeper’’ F691 (green spheres ) and the activation loop phosphorylation site Y842 (red spheres ). SU5614 (magenta

colored yellow and the NH2-terminal juxtamembrane domain colored blue.

FLT3 structures provide models for FLT3 inhibition by PKC412,
sunitinib/SU5614, and sorafenib in FLT3. Many staurosporine and
staurosporine derivative structures are available but none of
PKC412 (N-benzoyl-staurosporine or midostaurin). The tight
binding of PKC412 to FLT3 and correlations of PKC412 and
staurosporine binding strengths justify the use of staurosporine
structures as a model (24). Two were chosen for this study: 2HZ4
(tetrahydostaurosporine in ABL kinase; ref. 25) and 3D7T
(staurosporine in CSK; ref. 26). Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006 or Nexavar)
complexes include 1UWH, 1UWJ (wild-type and V599E B-raf,
respectively). Sunitinib (SU11248) and SU5614 share a kinase hinge
binding scaffold (indolinone), which may be found in the PDB via
other cognates as in PDB entry 2JAM. Finally, structure 2z60
provided a kinase domain with an isoleucine residue as a
gatekeeper associated with drug resistance.
PKC412 and mutations at N676. The asparagine at position
676 does not likely have direct contacts with any of the inhibitors,
so its occurrence may seem surprising. The residue is not highly
conserved (less that 65% among tyrosine kinases) outside the
PDGFR tyrosine kinase family. However, in the FLT3 structure, the
side chain can be seen to structure the loop between the h strands
via hydrogen bonds to the main chain, and also with the glutamic
acid E692 of the hinge segment (Fig. 4A). N676 is highly conserved
among the tyrosine kinases that have a single residue glycine
insertion at the beginning of the loop, and E692 is also highly
conserved. The mutation was observed in a PKC412-resistant
patient (10), and was also noted in an in vitro mutating PCR screen
for resistant mutants, attributed to destabilization of the hinge
region (21).
The occurrence of the mutation at this site, not directly in
contact with the ATP binding site, together with the low acquired
resistance for SU5614 and sorafenib, might indicate that PKC412
binds in a manner different from staurosporine-derived models.

www.aacrjournals.org

Indeed, a partially hydrogenated staurosporine cognate with
micromolar IC50 activity is seen to bind ABL in alternate locations
(pdb code 2HZ4; ref. 25). However, the selectivity patterns for
staurosporine and PKC412 are qualitatively similar (24). Furthermore, N659K in PDGFRA, the N676 equivalent position, has been
described in GIST (27), and the neighboring V654 in cKit is
frequently mutated to alanine in imatinib resistant GIST (see
Supplementary Table S1; ref. 28). Taken together, these data
support a model for resistance arising from structural effects
transmitted to the ATP binding site via an altered loop structure.
The equivalent residue in FGFR2, N549, has been analyzed as one
of a triad of residues that form a ‘‘molecular brake’’ (29). This
structure contributes to autoinhibition in several tyrosine kinase
subfamilies (Supplementary Table S1). Its disruption removes a
barrier for rotation of the N-lobe relative to the C-lobe in the
formation of an active conformation.
The gatekeeper mutations. With phenylalanine as the
gatekeeper residue, FLT3 is unusual among PDGFR family protein
kinases. Among the tyrosine kinases, phenylalanine is a typical
gatekeeper for Trk receptor kinases, and is otherwise characteristic
especially of the CMGC kinases, including, e.g., CDK2 ( for which
there is a crystal structure of a complex with staurosporine: 1aq1).
The relative positions of the inhibitors and F691 are illustrated in
Fig. 4B. The inhibitors may have aromatic stacking interactions
with the gatekeeper. This is especially true for sorafenib, which
generated the mutant in these studies. PKC412 may also have
stacking interactions, as observed in the CDK2-staurosporine
complex structure (pdb entry 1aq1), but the lack of sensitivity to
the F691L interaction would show that this type of interaction is
not critical to PKC412 binding. In addition, this does not explain
the large difference in sensitivities between F691I and F691L
variants. Although an isoleucine at the gatekeeper position is
commonly observed as a drug resistant mutation, ligand binding

data do not support a hypothesis that the cause is weakened
binding to PKC412. For example, the phage display kinase profiling
data of Karaman and colleagues (24) shows 10-fold tighter binding
of staurosporine for ABL T315I over ABL wt.
The cys mutant. The mutation C828S, generated only by
SU5614, leads to moderate resistance for SU5614 and PKC412 but
only weak or no resistance for SU11248 and sorafenib. One possible
structural explanation for this may be favorable aromat-sulfur
interactions.
The superposition of structures places the indolinone of SU5614
directly over the cysteine sulfur with a geometry for which the
interaction may contribute significantly to binding energies (30).
Similar interactions may play a role in PKC412 binding.
Activation loop mutations. The remaining mutants occur on
the activation loop. Modeling the structural determinants of the

resistance properties is complicated by the fact that tyrosine kinase
activation loops typically display a wide range of structures,
variously associated with different states of activity (Fig. 4C).
The FLT3 crystal structure 1RJB shows the native (and not a
oncogenic) protein in an autoinhibited conformation. Thus,
consideration of drug effects on secondary mutations of ITDtransformed FLT3 requires the use of a wide variety of indirect
structural evidence. The key data that beg explanation include the
following: (a) Mutation of the phosphorylation site Y842 confers
the strongest resistance against SU5614 and sorafenib but little or
no resistance against PKC412. Paradoxically, SU5614 does not
generate some of the mutants that confer strongest resistance. (b)
Sorafenib resistance is associated only with Y842 mutation,
whereas a variety of activation loop mutations also confer
resistance against SU5614.

Figure 4. Details of binding at the hinge region (A and B) and the activation loop (C and D ). Staurosporine (as model for PKC412) is represented as cyan sticks or
surface; several superimposed binding positions are shown for the indolinone model for SU5614 (magenta ) and for sorafenib (green ). A, the role of Asn676 in stabilizing
the hinge region is shown by highlighting hydrogen bonding interactions (red dashes ) between main chain atoms of the residue to the hinge, from the side chain to
main chain atoms in the loop, and from the side chain to the conserved glutamic acid at position 692 of the hinge sequence. B, inhibitor binding geometries relative to the
site of the gatekeeper residue. Superposition of the FLT3 structure (PDB 1RJB; yellow ) with the structure of the T315I ABL mutant (PDB 2Z60) shows a potential
rotamer configuration for the mutant gatekeeper side chain in FLT3 (red sticks ). Aromatic stacking interactions between the inhibitor and the gatekeeper may be
important for inhibitor binding, especially for sorafenib (green surface ). As with ABL and many PDGFR family tyrosine kinases, the gatekeeper induces strong drug
resistance when mutated to isoleucine but not leucine. The steric clash between Phe830 of the activation loop (B, orange sticks ; D, blue sticks ) and staurosporine
binding is evident. C and D, alternate views of the activation loop in comparison with c-Kit structures. Superposition of autoinactivated FLT3 (PDB 1RJB) with cKit
structures (inactive form, PDB 1T45; imatinib-bound inactive form, PDB 1T46) illustrates the key role of Tyr842 (violet sticks ) in stabilizing the inactive activating loop
fold. Its side chain is buried, forming hydrophobic contacts as well as anchoring polar contacts (red dashes ). The activation loop folds of FLT3 (gray cartoon)
autoinhibited by the juxtamembrane domain (cyan cartoon ) superimposes almost exactly with inactive cKit (yellow cartoon ). Imatinib-bound cKit (blue cartoon) shows a
slightly altered inactive conformation. Superposition of the modeled inhibitor geometries shows the similarities between imatinib (blue sticks ) and sorafenib (green
sticks ; C). Although a small shift of the activation loop can resolve the steric clash between imatinib (blue sticks ) and the Phe of the DFG motif (Phe830 in FLT3,
blue sticks in D, orange sticks in B ), the clash between PKC412 (here staurosporine; cyan sticks/spheres ) cannot be relaxed in the same manner (B and D ).
By contrast, the modeled positions of SU5614 (violet sticks/surface ) and sorafenib (green sticks/surface) show little or no clash with the activation loop in the inactive
geometry.

FLT3-ITD Resistance Profiles

Although they all bind at the ATP site (see discussion above for
possible exceptions), the three inhibitors bind in qualitatively
different ways. Figures 3 and 4C illustrate how sorafenib binds
to the inactive kinase in the inhibitor ‘‘type II’’ mode. Type II
inhibitors, including sorafenib, imatinib, and others, occupy a
volume (in Fig. 3, right, the right half of sorafenib) that is
inaccessible when the kinase has a catalytically active geometry.
Figure 4B and D highlight a unique feature of PKC412 binding.
Both sorafenib and SU5614 can fit into the autoinhibited FLT3
structure, with only minor adjustments of the activation loop.
PKC412 on the other hand would require a large-scale translation
of the activation loop main chain to bind. Because FLT3 adopts
a range of structures, these qualitative differences seem likely to
be related to the qualitatively different patterns of resistance
mutations.
The autoinactivation mechanism of FLT3 via juxtamembrane
domain binding was shown by the crystal structure 1RJB (18), and
is also shown in closely related cKit (23). The internal tandem
duplication mutations are thought to activate FLT3 by disrupting
the inactivation mechanism (18). Mutations at the activation loop
are known to confer constitutive activity to FLT3, presumably by
‘‘destabilizing the activation loop’’ in its autoinhibitor role (e.g.,
N841I, Y; ref. 31). The observation that many activation loop
mutations are able to confer resistance to SU5614 may indicate
that this inhibitor partially stabilizes the inactive kinase but
becomes ineffective with additional active loop destabilization. In
contrast, sorafenib, as a type II inhibitor, can bind to the inactive
form and stabilize it more strongly, analogous to imatinib binding
of c-Kit (23). Only a small set of activation loop mutations are
sufficiently destabilizing the inactive form to render sorafenib
ineffective. These involve mutations of Y842 because its interactions most strongly stabilize the inactivated state (Fig. 4C–D).
PKC412, by contrast, inhibits an active form of the kinase, or at
least a form of the kinase in which the activation loop is
significantly refolded compared with the inactivated form, and is
therefore unaffected by mutations that destabilize the active form.

Discussion
Mutations causing resistance to therapeutic kinase inhibition
can be identified in target kinases in various malignant diseases,
such as Bcr-Abl in imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous
leukemia (CML; refs. 20, 32), cKit in imatinib-resistant GIST (33),
epidermal growth factor receptor in gefitinib-resistant non–small
cell lung cancer (34), and FIP1L1-PDGFRA in imatinib-resistant
HES/CEL (35). Alternative kinase inhibitors have been developed
that can overcome some of the known resistance mutations. The
best-studied example is CML, where nilotinib (Tasigna) and
dasatinib (Sprycel) showed activity against many of the known
imatinib resistance mutations in Bcr-Abl both in vitro (36, 37) and
in clinical trials (38, 39). Preclinical models have been developed
that allow generation of specific resistance profiles in a given drugtarget pair (17, 19, 21). Using these strategies, the results for Bcr-Abl
and the Abl kinase inhibitors imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib
show a good correlation of in vitro results to clinical findings in
patients with CML and resistance to these compounds (17, 40), and
predict a narrowed, however largely overlapping, profile of Bcr-Abl
resistance mutations for nilotinib and dasatinib compared with
imatinib (19, 41, 42).
Here, we show that different ATP competitor–type, small
molecule FLT3 inhibitors can produce largely nonoverlapping

www.aacrjournals.org

profiles of secondary resistance mutations in an FLT3-ITD
background using a cell-based screening strategy. This finding
might reflect distinct binding modes of different inhibitor scaffolds,
resulting in distinct conformations of the FLT3 kinase domain
available for binding. Screening with SU5614 exclusively produced
TK2 exchanges. This is in line with a previous report that identified
the FLT3-ITD TK2 mutations Y842H and D835N in SU5614resistant cell lines (43). All activation loop exchanges retained
sensitivity to PKC412, which inhibits an active form of the kinase,
and thereby might not be affected by activation loop variants
destabilizing the inactive state. In contrast, exchanges emerging in
PKC412-resistant clones were limited to position N676 in TK1.
Thus far, a single case of a patient with a secondary mutation in
FLT3-ITD TK1 (N676K) has been described in the context of
PKC412 resistant FLT3-ITD positive AML (10), confirming the
clinical significance of this position for PKC412 resistance.
Although the N676S exchange was fully responsive to SU5614,
the N676I and D exchanges lead to moderate cross-resistance to
SU5614. Degenerative PCR-based mutagenesis of FLT3-ITD TK1
and subsequent selection in the presence of PKC412 previously has
identified TK1 exchanges causing PKC412 resistance, including
two of the three N676 exchanges that we report here (21). In this
study, in addition to N676 exchanges, F691I/L and G797R/S were
identified. Although FLT3-ITD F691L only slightly interferes with
PKC412 response (cellular IC50 is 10 nmol/L in our hands), F691I
leads to a strong PKC412 resistance and therefore should also come
up in a cell-based screen. However, we were able to identify an F691
exchange only in the sorafenib screen, probably because the yield
of resistant clones using PKC412 in a cell-based approach is limited
by PKC412 toxicity. Pharmacokinetic analyses of PKC412 in phase 1
and 2 clinical trials showed that plasma concentrations in the
range of 5 Amol/L can be achieved (8, 44). However, declining
concentrations over time and high plasma protein binding can
result in actual drug levels in the range of 50 nmol/L or lower (8, 10,
44). Thus, PKC412 at 100 nmol/L, the concentration we selected for
screening might very well reflect actual drug levels achievable in
treated patients. Although PKC412 at 50 nmol/L still would be
sufficient to fully inhibit wild-type FLT3-ITD or secondary TK2
mutations identified with SU5614 and sorafenib in this study, this
concentration clearly would not be adequate to suppress N676D,
N676I, or F691I.
FLT3-ITD F691I is the only exchange causing strong resistance
not only to PKC412 but also to SU5614, SU11248, and sorafenib.
Thus, once FLT3-ITD F691I emerges in the clinic, a switch to a
different FLT3 inhibitor probably would not be effective. However,
the use of the dual PI3K/PDK-1 inhibitor BAG956 (45), combinations of PKC412 and the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor,
rapamycin (46) or the IAP inhibitor, LBW242 (47), have shown
activity against FLT3-ITD F691I in cell lines.
The indolinone SU11248 (Sunitinib, Sutent) and the biaryl urea
BAY 43-9006 (Sorafenib, Nexavar) recently entered clinical testing
in FLT3 mutated (Sunitinib) and FLT3 wt and mutated AML
(Sorafenib; refs. 15, 48). Steady-state plasma levels of up to
1 Amol/L for sunitinib and 4 Amol/L for sorafenib have been
reported in phase I trials in solid tumors (49). Interestingly, when
we performed cross-resistance studies with both compounds, we
noted that TK2 exchanges identified with SU5614 did not cause
relevant cross-resistance to SU11248. Furthermore, N676 exchanges
generated with PKC412 were fully suppressed at 500 nmol/L
SU11248. This was also the case for sorafenib with the exception of
Y842D, which shifted cellular IC50 30-fold to 250 nmol/L. In

accordance, screening with sorafenib produced a distinct set of
resistance mutations at positions D842(H/N/S) and F691L, and
these exchanges resulted in a profound, clinically significant
resistance to sorafenib. Although the finding of F691I/L causing
strong sorafenib resistance already has been reported (50), it is
interesting to note that sorafenib resistance mutations in FLT3-ITD
TK2 seem to be restricted to a very specific subset of Y842
exchanges, namely Y842D/H/N and S but not Y842C or exchanges
at S841. As noted, this might be because only the key Y842 mutants
sufficiently destabilize the inactive form to interfere with sorafenib
binding. However, all Y842 exchanges were responsive to PKC412,
and at clinically achievable concentrations, also to SU11248.
Taken together, we provide a comprehensive prediction of FLT3ITD TK1 and TK2 resistance mutations that might develop in the
treatment of FLT3-ITD–positive AML with specific FLT3 inhibitors.
Our data indicate that unlike the scenario in CML, where different
ABL kinase inhibitors display largely overlapping resistance
profiles, the pattern of specific resistance mutations is essentially
nonoverlapping for different FLT3 kinase inhibitors. This not only
