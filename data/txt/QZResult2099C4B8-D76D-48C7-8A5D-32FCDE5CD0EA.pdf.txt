ABSTRACT
DNA-PK is an enzyme that is required for proper DNA-repair and is thought to confer
radio-resistance in cancer cells. As a consequence, it is a high-profile validated target for
new pharmaceutical development. However, no FDA-approved DNA-PK inhibitors have
emerged, despite many years of drug discovery and lead optimization. This is largely
because existing DNA-PK inhibitors suffer from poor pharmacokinetics. They are not well
absorbed and/or are unstable, with a short plasma half-life. Here, we identified the first
FDA-approved DNA-PK inhibitor by “chemical proteomics”. In an effort to understand
how doxycycline targets cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), we serendipitously discovered
that doxycycline reduces DNA-PK protein expression by nearly 15-fold (> 90%). In
accordance with these observations, we show that doxycycline functionally radiosensitizes breast CSCs, by up to 4.5-fold. Moreover, we demonstrate that DNA-PK is
highly over-expressed in both MCF7- and T47D-derived mammospheres. Interestingly,
genetic or pharmacological inhibition of DNA-PK in MCF7 cells is sufficient to functionally
block mammosphere formation. Thus, it appears that active DNA-repair is required
for the clonal expansion of CSCs. Mechanistically, doxycycline treatment dramatically
reduced the oxidative mitochondrial capacity and the glycolytic activity of cancer cells,
consistent with previous studies linking DNA-PK expression to the proper maintenance
of mitochondrial DNA integrity and copy number. Using a luciferase-based assay, we
observed that doxycycline treatment quantitatively reduces the anti-oxidant response
(NRF1/2) and effectively blocks signaling along multiple independent pathways
normally associated with stem cells, including STAT1/3, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), Notch,
WNT and TGF-beta signaling. In conclusion, we propose that the efficacy of doxycycline
as a DNA-PK inhibitor should be tested in Phase-II clinical trials, in combination with
radio-therapy. Doxycycline has excellent pharmacokinetics, with nearly 100% oral
absorption and a long serum half-life (18–22 hours), at a standard dose of 200-mg
per day. In further support of this idea, we show that doxycycline effectively inhibits
the mammosphere-forming activity of primary breast cancer samples, derived from
metastatic disease sites (pleural effusions or ascites fluid). Our results also have

doxycycline is known to effectively cross the blood-brain barrier. Further studies will be
needed to determine if other tetracycline family members also confer radio-sensitivity.

would dramatically accelerate the potential use of
mitochondrial inhibitors in cancer patients [7].
Using this strategy, we experimentally identified 5
different classes of mitochondrially-targeted antibiotics that
successfully targeted CSCs [7]. Importantly, these FDAapproved drugs inhibited the growth of CSCs in 12 different
cancer cell lines, across 8 different tumor types (breast,
DCIS, ovarian, prostate, lung, pancreatic, melanoma, and
glioblastoma (brain)). The use of generic antibiotics for
cancer therapy could significantly reduce the costs of patient
care, making treatment more accessible.
Doxycycline is one of the most promising drugs that
emerged from these studies [7]. Since its FDA-approval in
1967, it has been successfully used as a broad-spectrum
antibiotic for nearly 50 years, without any major sideeffects. Currently, acne patients use doxycycline safely for
chronic therapy, for up to 6 months at a time, at a standard
dose of 200-mg per day [8, 9].
Mechanistically, in mammalian cells, doxycycline
functions as an inhibitor of mitochondrial biogenesis, by
binding to the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome
[2–4, 10, 11]. Doxycycline targets the mitochondrial
ribosome, as mitochondria evolved from bacteria over
millions of years of evolution [12, 13]. Therefore, bacterial
ribosomes and mitochondrial ribosomes show many
conserved properties and protein homologies. Recent clinical
trials with doxycycline (intended to target cancer-associated
infections, but not cancer cells) have already shown positive
therapeutic effects in lymphoma patients, although their
ability to eradicate CSCs was not yet appreciated [14–15].
Here, to better understand the mechanism(s) of
action of doxycycline on cancer cell metabolism, we
used an unbiased proteomics approach to identify which
proteins are effectively down-regulated by doxycycline.
This led to identification of doxycycline as the first
FDA-approved inhibitor of DNA-PK, which has broad
clinical implications for the use of doxycycline as a radiosensitizer, to overcome radio-resistance in CSCs.
Throughout this paper, we have used the term cancer
stem-like cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells (TICs). For
a very insightful discussion of the emerging terminology
surrounding the definition of CSCs or TICs, please see the
following review (16).

INTRODUCTION
Recently, we employed a label-free quantitative
proteomics approach to discover new therapeutic targets
in tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and/or cancer stem-like
cells (CSCs) [1]. Briefly, ER-positive breast cancer lines
were cultured under suspension conditions, allowing for
the formation of mammospheres (a.k.a., tumor-spheres).
Then, we compared the proteome of these tumor-spheres
directly to attached monolayer cells grown in parallel.
Using this approach, we identified several functional groups
of proteins that were specifically up-regulated in tumorspheres, relative to epithelial monolayers. More specifically,
mitochondrial proteins were dramatically over-expressed,
including key enzymes related to beta-oxidation and ketone
metabolism, as well as proteins involved in mitochondrial
biogenesis, and specific protein inhibitors of mitophagy [1].
Interestingly, our approach revealed > 60 mitochondrialrelated target proteins that were significantly over-expressed
in tumor-spheres. These mitochondrial proteins were also
transcriptionally over-expressed in human breast cancer
samples, highlighting their potential clinical importance. As
such, we believe that increased mitochondrial biogenesis
could provide a new mechanism for the accumulation of
mitochondrial mass in CSCs.
We also utilized a pharmacological approach to
functionally validate the importance of mitochondrial fuels,
by employing a specific MCT1/2 inhibitor, which prevents
the uptake of two mitochondrial fuels, ketone bodies and
L-lactate. Notably, inhibition of MCT function significantly
inhibited tumor-sphere formation in both ER-positive and
ER-negative breast cancer cell lines, with an IC-50 of
~1–2 μM [1]. Oligomycin A, an inhibitor of Complex V, the
mitochondrial ATP-synthase, showed very similar inhibitory
activity. Taken together, these results provide suggestive
evidence that the proliferative expansion of CSCs strictly
depends upon oxidative mitochondrial metabolism [1].
These findings could have future clinical implications for
eradicating CSCs, to minimize or prevent tumor recurrence,
metastasis and drug resistance. Of course, this would depend
on the clinical development of new non-toxic mitochondrial
inhibitors that are safe for the treatment of breast cancer
patients, which could require 10–15 years of intensive
pharmaceutical development and investment.
In summary, using this unbiased proteomic approach,
we identified a conserved dependence on mitochondrial
biogenesis for the clonal expansion and survival of CSCs.
Interestingly, it is well-known that certain FDA-approved
antibiotics inhibit mitochondrial biogenesis as a mild,
clinically manageably, side-effect [2–6]. Thus, we recently
proposed that these antibiotics could be re-purposed as a
relatively non-toxic approach to target CSCs. This approach

in 12 different cell lines, across eight different cancer
types, including breast cancer. More specifically, both
ER-positive (MCF7/T47D) and ER-negative (MDAMB-231) cell lines were all sensitive to doxycycline
treatment [7]. Interestingly, all three of these cell lines
were originally derived from the pleural effusions of
breast cancer patients, with metastatic disease. Thus,
we next tested if primary breast cancer samples derived
from metastatic disease sites were also sensitive to
doxycycline.

Importantly, Figure 1 shows that that doxycycline
dose-dependently inhibits mammosphere formation in
primary patient samples derived from metastatic disease
sites (either pleural effusions or ascites fluid). Moreover,
doxycycline appeared to work equally well in samples
derived from either ER-positive or ER-negative patients
(N = 4 patients in total) (See also Supplemental Figure 1).
As such, we obtained quantitatively similar results with
both well-established cell lines and primary breast cancer
samples.

showing that doxycycline dramatically inhibits the in vivo

required for DNA-repair using the mechanism of NHEJ
(non-homologous end joining) [18] [19]. DNA-PK
also functions to maintain the integrity and copy number
of mt-DNA, so there is a clear link with mitochondrial
metabolic function, as well [20].
Consistent with our current findings, we also
observed that DNA-PK is significantly over-expressed
in both MCF7 and T47D mammospheres (Table 2).
Remarkably, DNA-PK is infinitely upregulated in MCF7
mammospheres and nearly 15-fold increased in T47D
mammospheres, relative to monolayer cultures.

Doxycycline pre-treatment reduces the
mammosphere forming capacity of MCF7
monolayer cells
To better understand how doxycycline inhibits the
growth of CSCs, we used an unbiased proteomic approach
to identify its potential molecular targets. For this purpose,
we established conditions under which doxycycline
selectively inhibits the proliferation of CSCs, but not
“bulk” cancer cells.
First, MCF7 cells were pre-treated with doxycycline
(50 μM) as monolayers for 7- days and then re-plated for
the mammosphere assay, in the absence of doxycycline.
Figure 2 shows that pre-treatment with doxycycline,
under these conditions, is sufficient to significantly reduce
mammosphere forming capacity. However, this 7-day
treatment also significantly reduced proliferation in MCF7
cell monolayers to a similar extent, but did not affect the
viability of the remaining cells.
Therefore, we next shortened the pre-treatment
period to 3-days. Importantly, under these new conditions,
doxycycline (50 μM) reduced the mammosphere forming
capacity of MCF7 cells by ~ 50%, without affecting the
proliferation of the bulk monolayer cells (Figure 3). Thus,
doxycycline can be used to selectively reduce “stemness”
in MCF7 monolayers.

Clinical relevance of “doxycycline reduced
targets” in human breast cancers
To determine the potential clinical relevance of our
proteomic findings, we next assessed whether the protein
targets reduced by doxycycline were transcriptionally
upregulated in human breast cancer cells in vivo.
For this purpose, we employed a published clinical
data set of N = 28 breast cancer patients in which their
tumor samples were subjected to laser-capture microdissection, to physically separate epithelial cancer
cells from their adjacent tumor stroma [21]. Table 3
presents a summary of these findings. Importantly, most
of the protein targets reduced by doxycycline were
transcriptionally upregulated in human breast cancer cells
in tumors excised from patients.
In light of these findings, the new “doxycycline
reduced targets” that we identified may be particularly
relevant, for improving both the diagnosis and treatment
of human breast cancers.

Identification of the molecular targets of
doxycycline, using unbiased label-free
proteomics analysis: DNA-PK emerges as
a new target

Validation of DNA-PK as a therapeutic
target in CSCs
To validate the potential relevance of DNA-PK
for maintaining the growth of CSCs, we next used an
sh-RNA-approach. Briefly, MCF7 cells were transduced
with lentiviral vectors harboring either control sh-RNA
or sh-RNA species targeting the expression of DNA-PK.
Figure 4A illustrates that MCF7 cells harboring the DNAPK sh-RNA show a 50% reduction in mammosphere
forming capacity, as predicted. Loss of DNA-PK
expression was indeed confirmed by immunoblot analysis,
using specific antibody probes (Figure 4A).
Validation was also performed using a wellestablished DNA-PK inhibitor, namely KU-57788
[NU-7441] [22, 23]. Figure 4B directly shows that
KU-57788 [NU-7441] dose-dependently inhibits
MCF7 mammosphere formations, with an IC-50 between
100 nM and 1 μM.
Thus, DNA-PK activity appears to be required
for the efficient clonal expansion and anchorageindependent growth of CSCs, as observed using the
mammosphere assay.

Next, to begin to understand the molecular basis
of this selectively, we used these culture conditions
to perform unbiased proteomics analysis on MCF7
monolayers (treated with doxycycline for 3-days). The
results of this analysis are summarized in Table 1. Only
proteins reduced by ≥ 1.5-fold (p < 0.05) were considered
in the analysis. Importantly, Table 1 clearly highlights
that doxycycline pre-treatment of MCF7 cell monolayers
significantly reduced the expression of many key protein
targets functionally associated with mitochondrial
metabolism, glycolysis, the EMT, protein synthesis and
the DNA damage response, as well as inflammation and
protein degradation, in human breast cancer cells.
Interestingly, using this approach, we identified
DNA-PK as the protein target that was most dramatically
down-regulated by doxycycline, by nearly 15-fold
(> 90% reduction) (Table 1). DNA-PK (also known
as PRKDC) is the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent
protein kinase involved in DNA-repair. DNA-PK is

(50 μM) as monolayers for 7-days and then re-plated for the
mammsphere assay, in the absence of doxycycline. Note that pretreatment with doxycycline, under these conditions, is sufficient
to significantly reduce mammosphere forming capacity.
However, this 7-day treatment also reduced proliferation in
MCF7 cell monolayers to a similar extent, but did not affect the
viability of the remaining cells. Each data point in this figure is
the average of 9 replicates.

To test this hypothesis directly, MCF7 cell
monolayers were pre-treated with doxycycline (50 μM)
for 3-days and then irradiated. After radiation treatment,
monolayers were trypsinized and re-plated to evaluate
mammosphere growth over a 5-day period. Figure 5 shows
that radiation treatment significantly increases the growth
of CSCs by up to 1.45-fold, as expected. In contrast,
doxycycline pre-treatment increased the sensitivity of
CSCs to radiation by up to 4.5-fold. However, under these
conditions, doxycycline pre-treatment (with or without
radiation) had little or no effect on the proliferation or
viability of the “bulk” cancer cells (Figure 6A, 6B).

Doxycycline pre-treatment sensitizes CSCs to
radiation treatment
Since DNA-PK has been previously implicated in
the radio-resistance of cancer cells [24, 25] and we show
here that doxycycline functionally reduces the expression
of DNA-PK, we would predict that doxycycline treatment
should radio-sensitize CSCs.

Thus, doxycycline pre-treatment functionally
sensitizes CSCs to radiation, as predicted based on its
ability to reduce DNA-PK expression.

Importantly, Figure 10 shows that doxycycline
pre-treatment dose-dependently reduced the number of
live cells remaining after 10 hours of seeding on lowattachment plates. Under these conditions, doxycycline
pre-treatment also dose-dependently reduced the
mammosphere forming capacity of MCF7 cells, by
up to ~ 50%. Thus, doxycycline may exert its inhibitory
effects on mammosphere formation, in part, by effectively
reducing anoikis-resistance, during the initial time spent
under low-attachment conditions.

Validation of the metabolic phenotype induced
by doxycycline pre-treatment
Based on our proteomics analysis presented in
Table 1, both the levels of key mitochondrial proteins
and glycolytic enzymes were significantly reduced by
doxycycline pre-treatment. Thus, these results suggest
that doxycycline should reduce overall metabolic
activity in cancer cells.
To test this hypothesis further, we next examined
the metabolic profile of MCF7 cell monolayers
pre-treated with doxycycline (50 μM) for 2-days.
Interestingly, Figure 7 shows that the rates of both
oxidative mitochondrial metabolism and glycolysis were
dramatically reduced by doxycycline pre-treatment, as
measured using the Seahorse XFe96 analyzer to measure
metabolic flux. This resulted in significant reductions in
respiration (basal and maximal), as well as reduced ATP
levels (Figure 8). Finally, as seen in Figure 9, MCF7
cancer cells were shifted from a highly energetic to a
metabolically quiescent state.

Doxycycline simultaneously inhibits the
functional activity of multiple stem-cell
associated signal transduction pathways
To better understand which signaling pathways
are affected by doxycycline treatment, we used a panel
of eight MCF7-GFP cell lines engineered to express
different luciferase-based transcriptional reporters.
The functional activation state of these reporters was
then normalized by GFP expression, to account for cell
number.
Interestingly, Figure 11 directly shows that
doxycycline treatment of MCF7 monolayer cultures
inhibits both the anti-oxidant response (NRF1/2) and
STAT1/3 signaling, especially at 72 and 96 hours.
Similarly, Figure 12 illustrates that doxycycline also
dampens signaling along four other stem-cell associated
pathways, including Sonic Hedgehog, Notch, WNT and
TGF-beta signaling, again most prominently at 72  and
96 hours. Interestingly, in several cases, a bi-phasic
response was noted, with activation of signaling at
24 hours, and progressive inhibition from 48-to-96 hours.
These results directly support our observation that
doxycycline potently inhibits mammosphere formation,
by blocking the clonal expansion of CSCs and reduces
anoikis-resistance. Indeed, it has been reported that most
of these signaling pathways such as Notch, Hedgehog,
WNT, TGFβ, STAT3 or NRF1/2 are able to confer anoikisresistance, and inhibition of these pathways sensitizes
CSCs to anoikis.

Doxycycline reduces the anoikis-resistance of
MCF7 cells, prior to mammosphere formation
Anoikis is a specific type of programmed cell
death (apoptosis) that is induced in certain cell types,
under anchorage-independent growth conditions [26, 27].
Interestingly, epithelial CSCs show anoikis-resistance, and
are able to undergo mammosphere formation under these
anchorage-independent conditions [28].
Next, to determine the possible effects on anoikisresistance, MCF7 cells were pre-treated with doxycycline
(at 25 or 50 μM) as monolayers for 2-days and then replated on low-attachment plates, for either the anoikis
assay or the mammosphere assay, in the absence of
doxycycline.

Figure 4: DNA-PK is required for mammosphere formation in MCF7 cells. A. Genetic approach. MCF7 cells were transduced

with lentiviral vectors harboring either control sh-RNA or sh-RNA species targeting the expression of DNA-PK. Note that MCF7 cells
harboring the DNA-PK sh-RNA show a 50% reduction in mammosphere forming capacity, as predicted. B. Pharmacological approach. Note
that the well-established DNA-PK inhibitor, namely KU-57788 [NU-7441], dose-dependently inhibits MCF7 mammosphere formations,
with an IC-50 between 100 nM and 1 μM. As such, DNA-PK activity is required for the efficient clonal expansion and anchorageindependent growth of CSCs, as observed using the mammosphere assay. Each data point in this figure is the average of 9 replicates.

DISCUSSION

functionally associated with mitochondrial metabolism,
glycolysis, the EMT, protein synthesis and the DNA
damage response, as well as inflammation and protein
degradation, in human breast cancer cells. We further
validated that doxycycline suppresses both oxidative
mitochondrial metabolism and glycolysis, using
metabolic flux analysis. Doxycycline also inhibited
signal transduction along multiple stem-cell associated
communication pathways, namely Sonic Hedgehog,
Notch, WNT and TGF-beta signaling.
Interestingly, using this approach, we also identified
DNA-PK as the protein target that was most dramatically
down-regulated by doxycycline, by nearly 15-fold (> 90%
reduction) (Figure 13). DNA-PK is required for effective
cellular DNA-repair and also maintains the integrity and

Recently, we proposed that FDA-approved
antibiotics that adversely effect mitochondria could be used
to effectively target the cancer stem cell population, by
inhibiting mitochondrial biogenesis in tumor-initiating
cells (TICs) [7]. One of these  promising antibiotics is
doxycycline, a member of the tetracycline class, with
excellent pharmacokinetics.
To better understand how doxycycline exerts its
therapeutic effects, here we used a chemical proteomics
approach [29, 30] to more effectively interrogate the
target-phenotype relationship. Our results directly
show that doxycycline treatment significantly
reduced the expression of many key protein targets

were  pre-treated with doxycycline (50 μM) for 3-days and then irradiated. After radiation treatment, monolayers were trypsinized and
re-plated  to  evaluate mammosphere growth over a 5-day period. Note that radiation treatment significantly increases the growth of
CSCs by up to 1.45-fold, as expected. In contrast, doxycycline pre-treatment increased the sensitivity of CSCs to radiation by up to 4.5-fold.
In conclusion, doxycycline pre-treatment functionally sensitizes CSCs to radiation, as predicted based on its ability to reduce DNA-PK
expression. Each data point in this experiment is the average of 18 replicates.

experiments,
using
both genetic (DNA-PK sh-RNA) and pharmacological
(DNA-PK inhibitor: NU-7441) approaches directly
showed that DNA-PK expression or activity is required
for MCF7 cells to efficiently form mammospheres. This
is the first demonstration that DNA-PK is required for the
clonal expansion and survival of CSCs. Most importantly,
however, pre-treatment of MCF7 cell monolayers with
doxycycline was sufficient to increase the sensitivity of
CSCs to radiation treatment, by up to 4.5-fold.
Unfortunately, no FDA-approved DNA-PK inhibitors
have emerged, despite many years of drug discovery
and lead optimization. This is largely because existing
DNA-PK inhibitors suffer from poor pharmacokinetics.

absorption and a long serum half-life (18–22 hours), at a
standard dose of 200-mg per day [39, 40].
Thus, we propose that the efficacy of doxycycline as
a DNA-PK inhibitor should be tested in Phase-II clinical
trials, in combination with radio-therapy. In further
support of this idea, we show that doxycycline effectively
inhibits the mammosphere-forming activity of primary

at room temperature, using an X-ray unit, at a doserate of 1.37 Gy/min. More specifically, irradiation was
performed using a free-standing 320 kV x-ray system
(Gulmay Medical Ltd, now Xstrahl Ltd, Camberley, UK).
The machine was operated at 300 kV, 10 mA with the
addition of a 0.75 mm Cu filter to give a beam quality
with half-value layer (HVL) of 2.3 mm Cu. Samples were
positioned at a distance of 500 mm from the x-ray focus
and a backscatter block was utilised to ensure good dose
uniformity. The dose rate to samples was determined to be
1.37 Gy/min [43]. This dose rate was checked regularly
using the IPEM 2005 protocol and equipment whose
calibration was traceable to UK national standards.

Lentiviral transduction
Lentiviral particles harboring human DNA-PK
sh-RNA (#sc-35200-V, Santa Cruz) or control shRNA
lentiviral Particles (#sc-108080, Santa Cruz), were
used to stably transduce MCF7 cells, according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (in the presence of 5 μg/ml
polybrene). Twenty-four hours post-infection, media
containing the virus was removed and replaced with
standard media. Cells were then selected with 2 μg/ml
puromycin, for up to 10 days.

Figure 13: Doxycycline targets mitochondrial
biogenesis and DNA-repair, ultimately converging
on ATP production and energy metabolism in cancer
cells. DNA-PK activity is normally required for repairing mtDNA and maintaining mt-DNA copy number. Mitochondrial
biogenesis is dependent on mitochondrial protein synthesis,
which is carried out, in part, by mitochondrial ribosomes,
which share significant homology with bacterial ribosomes.
Doxycycline targets both mitochondrial ribosomes and DNAPK, thereby reducing ATP levels, as observed experimentally.

Immunoblot analysis

Pre-treatment of monolayers with doxycycline,
with and without radiation treatment

MCF7 cells were seeded in 10 cm dishes for 72 hrs.
Then, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma), containing
proteinase inhibitors (Roche) and kept at 4°C for
30 minutes. Lysates were collected by centrifugation for
10 minutes at 10,000 × g, and protein concentration were
determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).
Samples were diluted into SDS-PAGE sample buffer
and were boiled for 5 minutes before being separated by
SDS-PAGE, using a 4–15% gradient Mini-PROTEAN
TGX Gel (Biorad). Samples were then transferred
onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Biorad), blocked in
5% milk in TBS-Tween 20  (Sigma) and probed with
antibodies directed against DNA-PK (ThermoScientific,
#MS-423-P0) and β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
#sc-1616), using a secondary antibody at a dilution of
1 to 5000. Bound antibodies were detected using the
Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminiscent substrate
(ThermoScientific).

MCF7 cells were plated in normal medium (DMEM,
10% FCS, L-glutamine, supplemented with Pen-Strep)
for 24-hr. Cells were then treated, initially for 7 days
with doxycycline, with media changed every 3 days. For
subsequent experiments, cells were treated for 72-hr. For
radiation experiments, monolayer cells pre-treated with
doxycycline, were exposed to increasing levels of radiation,
and the cells collected by trypsinization and centrifugation.
To quantitatively determine cell growth, the number
of cells remaining after treatment was counted using an
automatic cell counter (Biorad), compared to untreated
cells and expressed as fold-change. To assess cell viability,
cells were incubated for 1 minute with Trypan Blue
(Sigma, #T8145) using a 1:1 ratio. The number of Trypan
Blue positive cells (non-viable) was measured using an
automatic cell counter (Biorad) and compared to untreated
controls. Cells were also plated into mammosphere cultures
to assess stem cell-like activity with no further drug
treatment. All experiments were performed in triplicate and
repeated at least three times independently.

Mammosphere culture
A single cell suspension was prepared using
enzymatic (1x Trypsin-EDTA, Sigma Aldrich, #T3924),
and manual disaggregation (25 gauge needle) to create a
single cell suspension [44]. Cells were plated at a density
of 500 cells/cm2 in mammosphere medium (DMEM-F12/
B27/20 ng/ml EGF/PenStrep) in non-adherent conditions,
in culture dishes coated with (2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate)

Irradiation of MCF7 monolayers using a cell

(poly-HEMA, Sigma, #P3932). Cells were grown for
5 days and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C
at an atmospheric pressure in 5% (v/v) carbon dioxide/air.
After 5 days for culture, spheres > 50 μm were counted
using an eye piece graticule, and the percentage of cells
plated which formed spheres was calculated and is
referred to as percentage mammosphere formation, and
was normalized to one (1 = 100% MSF). For proteomic
analysis, mammospheres were collected by centrifugation
at 800 rpm for 10 minutes and compared to monolayer
cells grown for 5 days.

(25 μM and 50 μM) for 48 h in XFe96 cell culture plates.
After 48 h of incubation in DMEM media, MCF-7 cells
were washed in XF assay media (or for OCR measurement,
XF assay media supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 1 mM
Pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine and adjusted at 7.4 pH),
which were pre-warmed to 37°C. MCF7 cells were then
maintained in 175 μL/well of XF assay media at 37°C, in a
non-CO2 incubator for 1 h. During the cell incubation time,
we loaded 25 μL of 80 mM glucose, 9 μM oligomycin,
1M 2-deoxyglucose (for ECAR measurement) and
10 μM oligomycin, 9 μM FCCP, 10 μM rotenone, 10 μM
antimycin A (for OCR measurement), in XF assay media
into the injection ports in the XFe96 sensor cartridge.
Measurements were normalized by protein content.
Data set was analyzed by XFe96 software and GraphPad
Prism software, using one-way ANOVA and Student’s
t-test calculations. All experiments were performed in
quintuplicate, three times independently, such that each data
point represents the average of 15 replicates.

Label-free quantitative proteomics analysis
Cell lysates were prepared for trypsin digestion
by sequential reduction of disulphide bonds with TCEP
and alkylation with MMTS [45]. Then, the peptides were
extracted and prepared for LC-MS/MS. All LC-MS/MS
analyses were performed on an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) coupled to
an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Scientific,
formerly Dionex, The Netherlands). Xcalibur raw data
files acquired on the LTQ-Orbitrap XL were directly
imported into Progenesis LCMS software (Waters Corp.,
Milford, MA, formerly Non-linear dynamics, Newcastle
upon Tyne, UK) for peak detection and alignment. Data
were analyzed using the Mascot search engine. Five
replicates were analyzed for each sample type (N = 5).
Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA and
only fold-changes in proteins with a p-value less than 0.05
were considered significant.

Following doxycycline treatment, the CSC population
was enriched by seeding on low-attachment plates. Under
these conditions, the non-CSCs undergo anoikis (a form of
apoptosis induced by a lack of cell-substrate attachment)
and CSCs are believed to survive. The surviving “CSC
fraction” was analyzed by FACS analysis. Briefly, 1 × 104
MCF7 cells were treated with doxycycline (25 μM and
50 μM) for 48 h in 6-well plates, grown as a monolayer.
Then, the monolayer cells were trypsinized and seeded
in low-attachment plates in mammosphere media. After
10 h under low-attachment conditions, MCF7 cells were
spun down and incubated with LIVE/DEAD dye (Fixable
Dead Violet reactive dye; Invitrogen) for 20 minutes to
distinguish between the live and dead populations of cells
(cell viability), during anoikis. Samples were then analyzed
by FACS (Fortessa, BD Bioscence) and the data were
analysed using FlowJo software.

Data mining
To firmly establish the clinical relevance of our
results from the quantitative proteomics analysis of
mammosheres, we re-analyzed the transcriptional profiles
of epithelial breast cancer cells and adjacent tumor
stromal cells that were physically separated by lasercapture microdissection (from N = 28 human breast cancer
patients) [21].

Monitoring cell signal transduction pathways
The Cignal Lenti luciferase reporter assay was used to
monitor the activity of several signaling pathways in MCF7GFP cells, essentially as previously described [46,  47].
Briefly, viral particles diluted 1:10 in complete media
containing polybrene (sc-134220, Santa Cruz) were added
to the cells. Puromycin treatment (P9620, Sigma) was added
48 h later in order to stably select infected cells. Luciferase
assays (E1501, Promega) were performed according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 6 × 103 MCF7
cells were seeded in black-walled 96 well plates. When cells
were attached, drug treatments were added for 24, 48, 72
and 96 h. Four replicates were used for each condition. After

Seahorse XFe96 metabolic flux analysis
Extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) and realtime oxygen consumption rates (OCR) for MCF7 and
MCF7 treated with doxycycline were determined using the
Seahorse Extracellular Flux (XFe96) analyzer (Seahorse
Bioscience, MA, USA). MCF7 cells were maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (fetal bovine serum),
2 mM GlutaMAX, and 1% Pen-Strep. We seeded 7,000
cells per well into XFe96 well cell culture plates and they
were incubated overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified
atmosphere. After 24 h, the cells were treated with DOX
