Abstract:

Colorectal cancer metastatic recurrence and chemoresistance are major causes
of morbidity and mortality. Colon cancer initiating cells (CCIC) are thought to
contribute to both these processes. To identify drugs with anti-CCIC activity we
screened a number of FDA approved and investigational compounds. We found
that the class I selective histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) MGCD0103 has
significant activity against CCIC, and also significantly inhibits non-CCIC CRC cell
xenograft formation. Both MGCD0103 and the pan-HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin
impairs CCIC clonogenicity and cause cell cycle arrest and cell death. Gene
expression profiling revealed that the canonical WNT ligand DKK-1 is a highly
upregulated target of HDAC inhibitors. Despite the presence of APC mutations
and constitutive WNT signaling in CCIC, both transfected and recombinant DKK-1
dramatically inhibit CCIC proliferation and clonogenicity. Overall, these data show
that inhibition of class I HDACs is a promising novel approach to target both CCIC
and non-CCIC CRC cells. Our studies also provide novel insights into roles for DKK1
in addition to canonical WNT signaling and the mechanism of CCIC tumor formation.

Introduction

levels of DNA damage response genes, which contribute
to chemoresistance [3]. They also have lower reactive
oxygen species (ROS) levels as another mechanism
conferring resistance to radiation, and in fact have less
DNA damage after ionizing radiation [4]. These cells also
express high levels of drug efflux transporter genes that
also lead to chemoresistance and relapse [5].
Recent CRC focused studies show that colon
cancer initiating cells (CCIC) are enriched in xenogenic
tumors growing in mice treated with chemotherapy, and
that CCIC rapidly regenerate new tumors even with
concurrent therapy [6, 7]. Additionally, high NOTCH
signaling levels cause CRC chemoresistance [8] and our
own recent studies show that CCIC have 10-30X higher
NOTCH levels than non-CCIC CRC cells as a potential
mechanism of chemoresistance and tumor recurrence [9].

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 2nd leading cause of
cancer death in the United States. Chemotherapy is the
primary form of treatment once CRC has spread beyond the
colon. However, in most cases tumors recur and become
refractory to chemotherapy. In part, tumor recurrence and
chemoresistance is attributed to stochastic genetic and
epigenetic changes, which cause selection of resistant
clones that form new tumors. Recently, an additional
mechanism of tumor recurrence and chemoresistance has
been proposed. This mechanism postulates that a minority
of cells in a tumor (referred to as cancer stem cells or
cancer initiating cells) are intrinsically more chemo- and
radiation resistant [1, 2]. In support of this model, recent
studies have demonstrated that these cells express high

in particular, is thought to be a promising strategy to
improve anti-CRC chemotherapy. MGCD0103 is the first
Class I selective HDACi to enter clinical trials. Phase I/
II clinical studies show that MGCD0103 is active against
lymphomas [13-15]. Currently, non-class specific HDACi
are FDA approved for treatment of lymphomas. Both class
specific and pan-HDACi are also actively being evaluated
in the treatment of a variety of solid tumors as well.
WNT signalling plays a critical role in both CCIC
and non-CCIC CRC cell proliferation and the majority
of CRC tumors have increased WNT signaling [16, 17].
Canonical WNT signaling is initiated by ligand binding
to Frizzled-Lrp5/6 cell surface receptors. This binding
triggers a signaling cascade that causes β-catenin nuclear
translocation. β-catenin binds to LEF/TCF transcription
factors and upregulates genes important in proliferation
and anti-apoptosis, such as MYC and CCD1. APC is a core
component of the cytoplasmic “destruction complex” that
degrades β-catenin via the proteasome. APC mutations
are very common in CRC and cause constitutive WNT
signaling by nuclear β-catenin.
Dickopf (DKK) family proteins are extracellular WNT
antagonists that bind to LRP5/6 with co-factors. DKK-1 is
thought to be the most important family member in CRC.
DKK-1 causes LRP 5/6 endocytosis and downregulation,
inhibiting downstream canonical WNT signaling [18]. In
transgenic mice, targeted overexpression of DKK-1 to the
intestine inhibits proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells
in villi and crypts [19]. DKK-1 also inhibits epithelial cell
polarization and migration, processes that are important in
tumor progression and metastasis [20].
DKK-1 expression is downregulated in human CRC.
In many tumors DKK-1 is epigenetically silenced. In colon
cancer cell lines where DKK-1 is epigenetically silenced,
forced expression of DKK-1 inhibits proliferation and
reduces xenograft tumor growth. Overall, DKK-1 is
thought to act as a growth suppressor for CRC [21].
However, the mechanism of DKK-1 growth inhibition is
poorly characterized.
We previously derived CCIC from primary CRCs
[9]. To understand the mechanism of CCIC tumor
formation we screened a variety of drugs for CCIC
anti-proliferative activity. These included standard
conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs such as
5-FU and oxaliplatin, EGF Receptor inhibitors, IGF1
Receptor inhibitors, nitrosylated NSAIDs, and targeted
agents including sunitinib and sorafenib, among others.
CCIC were also resistant to almost all the agents screened,
with the exception of the Class I HDACi MGCD0103.
MGCD0103 effectively inhibits CCIC proliferation and
clonogenicity. Furthermore, MGCD0103 is also active
against commonly used non-CCIC CRC cell lines. These
data were confirmed with the non-class specific HDACi
Trichostatin (TSA). Gene expression profiling revealed
that a mechanism of HDACi induced CCIC growth arrest
and apoptosis is upregulation of the WNT antagonist

% Tumor Growth Inhibition

As CCIC are thought to both self-renew and give
rise to non-CCIC CRC cancer cells that populate tumors,
epigenetic control of gene expression has been proposed
as a likely mechanism to regulate the CCIC to non-CCIC
CRC cancer cell transition. Drugs that modulate epigenetic
state are therefore a promising approach for anti-CCIC
targeted therapy. The covalent modification of histones
(such as methylation or acetylation) is an important
mechanism of epigenetic regulation. Transcriptionally
active gene promoters generally have hyperacetylated
chromatin while transcriptionally silent genes have
hypoacetylated chromatin. Histone acetyltransferases
(HATs) catalyze the addition of acetyl groups onto histones
and act as transcription co-activators. Conversely, Histone
deacetylases (HDACs) are transcription co-repressors
that remove acetyl groups from histones. There are three
distinct classes of HDACs. Class I includes HDACs 1,2,3
and 8, Class II HDACs 4-7 and 9-11, and Class III the
SIR2 family. HDACs inhibit the expression of target
genes to which they are bound by deacetylating Histone
3 at lysines K9 and K14 in target promoters. HDAC
inhibitors directly relieve repression of these targets by
preventing Histone 3 K9 and K14 de-acetylation. H3 K9/
K14 deacetylation causes subsequent trimethylation of
H3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me3) to maintain longer-term gene
upregulation.
Normal colon mucosa has high levels of Class I
HDACs and CRCs have higher histone acetylation levels
than normal colon [10, 11]. HDAC inhibitor treated APC
mutant mice develop fewer intestinal adenomas [12].
Therefore, HDAC inhibition, and Class I HDAC inhibition

Results

DKK-1. Overall, our data show that MGCD0103 is a
promising approach to target CCIC as well as non-CCIC
CRC cells. This dual activity is important because CCIC
are highly chemoresistant. Our data also provide evidence
that DKK-1 can inhibit proliferation and clonogenicity
even in CCIC that carry APC mutations. This result is
consistent with a role for DKK1 to inhibit CCIC growth
through mechanisms in addition to its role in canonical
WNT signaling pathways and provides insight into the
mechanisms of CCIC proliferation, tumor formation and
chemoresistance.

19μM (Table 1). In addition, cell cycle analysis of HCT15

inhibits proliferation of colon cancer cell lines and causes
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
To test if MGCD0103 had anti-CRC activity
in xenograft models we treated mice injected with
commonly used CRC cell lines including SW48, Colo 205
and HCT116. When the tumors reached ~100mm3 mice
were randomized into groups of 6-8 animals and treated
with MGCD0103 i.p. or vehicle. Tumors were measured
2-3 times a week for up to 3 weeks. Treatment of mice
with MGCD0103 had anti-tumor activity in all commonly

the 3D matrigel in vitro culture as previously described
we treated CCIC with MGCD0103 for 72h and then
cultured in normal media. We then quantified CCIC tumor
formation in 3D culture in vitro. MGCD0103 treated cells
formed no tumor foci. Only a few single, isolated CCIC
cells were still observed (Figure 3B). Morphologically,
cells have apoptotic bodies and lose self-renewal (Figure
3B and data not shown). In summary, both MTS and 3D
tumor formation assays are consistent with inhibition
of proliferation as a mechanism of MGCD0103 action.
Similar results were seen with TSA treatment (data not
shown). Furthermore, cells treated with MGCD0103 and
TSA were cultured in 3D cultures for up to 2 months after
treatment to evaluate if cells can recover from a pulse of
HDACi Even after two months of culture CCIC failed to
recover and form tumor foci in 3D culture as compared
to control. This suggests that HDAC inhibitors not only
inhibit proliferation but can induce long-term (possibly
permanent) changes in the CCIC epigenetic state that
inhibit tumor formation.
To understand if HDACi treatment causes CCIC cell
death we performed FACS and cell cycle analysis. This
revealed that CCIC initiate apoptosis, indicated by the
presence of a sub-G1 peak is present in CCIC treated with
TSA (Figure 4A). In summary, HDACi causes CCIC cell
cycle arrest, which is followed by cell death.

used CRC cell lines tested, as well as other solid tumor
cell lines. For colon cancer the growth inhibition was 60%
in an aggressive xenograft model such as HCT116 and
almost complete growth inhibition in Colo205 (Figure 1).

MGCD0103 inhibits CCIC viability
After demonstrating that MGCD0103 has anti-tumor
activity in non-CCIC CRC cell lines, we next evaluated
anti-CCIC activity, comparing MGCD0103 to standard
conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy agents such as
5-FU, and oxaliplatin and SN38/CPT-11. CCIC viability
was significantly impaired by MGCD0103 (Figure
2A). Consistent with previous results, CCIC are highly
resistant to 5FU/oxaliplatin [7] (Figure 2B). Combining
5FU/oxaliplatin and MGCD0103 further decreased CCIC
viability and proliferation in a dose dependent manner
(Figure 2B). To determine if this effect was specific to
CCIC we treated CCIC and normal epithelial cell lines
in the same experiment. When treated with MGCD0103,
CCIC viability was impaired significantly more than
MCF10A cells (Figure 2C). These data show that the
same concentration of MGCD0103 reduces CCIC
viability more effectively than the other cell types tested.
Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with
a pan-HDAC inhibitor TSA (data not shown).

The epigenetic state of CCIC is thought to be
different from non-CCIC CRC cell lines. To identify
the mechanism of HDACi induced growth arrest and
apoptosis we performed gene expression profiling of two
distinct CCIC lines treated with 0.7 µM MGCD0103,
1 µM TSA or mock control for 6 hours. The short time
period after treatment was used in order to focus on direct

Induction of DKK-1 by MGC0103 is not as robust as TSA

not shown). Overall, these analyses were consistent with
a mechanistic role for DKK-1 in HDACi induced CCIC
growth arrest and apoptosis.

targets of HDAC inhibition rather than downstream
indirect transcriptional effects. We used Cyber T analysis
to find differentially expressed genes between both groups
i.e. control vs. MGCD0103 and control vs. TSA. The panHDAC inhibitor TSA treatment caused differential gene
expression (DEG) of 4440 target genes common to both
CCIC lines, and the Class I HDAC inhibitor MGCD0103
caused DEG of 2040 genes in the same lines. In many
experiments, gene array studies can have a high falsepositive rate. To minimize the false positive rate, we
focused our analysis on genes regulated up or down that
were common to both the pan-HDAC and class I specific
HDAC inhibitors and seen in both CCIC lines, which
gave a set of 1126 DEG. The significantly regulated
genes (PPDE = 0.99) in each group were then overlapped
to find a common subset of genes that are differentially
expressed in both treatment groups (Figure 5A). The gene
list was used in NIH DAVID (Database for Annotation,
Visualization and Integrated Discovery) (http://david.
abcc.ncifcrf. gov/) resource. DNA damage response and
cell cycle arrest were among the top GO categories that are
enriched (Table 2). Notably, the expression of the WNT
antagonist DKK-1 increased 18-fold in CCIC treated
with TSA and 7.7-fold in MGCD0103 treated CCIC. To
validate the array data we performed q-PCR analysis for
DKK-1 on cells treated with increasing concentrations of
TSA. TSA induces DKK-1 expression in a dose dependant

DKK-1 inhibits CCIC proliferation
To test if DKK-1 induced CCIC growth arrest and
apoptosis we first transfected CCIC with an expression
vector for DKK-1 or GFP control. Equal numbers of
CCIC were plated in 3D culture system to assay tumor
foci formation. Cells transfected with DKK-1 had fewer
and smaller tumor foci vs. GFP control (Figure 6A,B).
Next, we used recombinant DKK-1 to treat CCIC already
plated in 3D assays. Again, DKK-1 caused fewer and
smaller tumor foci vs. control (Figure 6C). DKK-1
inhibition of WNT signaling is upstream of APC and the
beta-catenin destruction complex. As mutations in APC
are common in CRC we tested if APC is mutated in
CCIC. Western analysis revealed that the two CCIC lines
studied both have APC protein truncations and no WT
APC protein (Figure 6D). Next, we stained for β-catenin
in xenograft samples from these CCIC lines. Nuclear
β-catenin is an indicator of active WNT signaling. We

MGCD0103 and TSA induce CCIC cell cycle arrest,
and apoptosis. Mechanistically, our study provides insights
into the primary targets of HDAC inhibition in CCIC.
DKK-1 is epigenetically silenced in many CRCs but can be
dramatically up-regulated by treatment with MGCD0103
or TSA. Consistent with a functional role for DKK-1, both
transfected and recombinant DKK-1 significantly reduce
CCIC proliferation and clonogenicity in 3D cultures.
Overall, our results suggest DKK-1 may be a useful
pharmacogenetic biomarker for MGCD0103 clinical trials
for CRC and possibly other solid tumors. Previous studies
have shown that promoter hypermethylation causes DKK1 silencing in CRC and that this is not an early event but
more closely associated with late tumor progression [21].
Because epigenetic state is thought to play an important
role in the CCIC to non-CCIC CRC cell transition, it is
tempting to speculate that HDACi upregulation of DKK-1
transcription in CCIC may prevent subsequent promoter
methylation in non-CCIC CRC daughter cells. Future
immunohistochemistry co-localization studies in CRCs
of DKK-1 and CCIC markers such as ALDH1 or CD44/
CD166 (and in parallel co-localization studies with nonCCIC CRC cell markers such as CEA) will be useful to
understand the precise role of DKK-1 expression in both
CCIC and non-CCIC CRC cells.
Constitutive activation of canonical WNT signaling

found that nuclear beta-catenin is present in xenografts
derived from both lines and is consistent with active
WNT signaling (Figure 6E). Similar results were seen
with 3Dculture CCIC tumors (data not shown). Overall,
our data are consistent with DKK-1 as a potent inhibitor
of CCIC proliferation and tumor formation, but through
a mechanism that is independent of canonical WNT
signaling. DISCUSSION:CRC metastatic recurrence and
chemoresistance are major causes of cancer related death
in the United States. Recent experiments have implicated
a role for CCIC in both of these processes. Identifying
novel compounds and drug combinations that target both
CCIC and non-CCIC CRC cells is an important approach
to improve CRC patient outcomes.
To identify potential anti-CCIC therapeutics
we screened through a number of FDA approved and
investigational drugs and found the class I HDACi
MGCD0103 to be the most effective of the agents tested.
We also found MGCD0103 to effectively inhibit the
growth of non-CCIC CRC cells. Since Class I HDACs
1-3 are over expressed in CRC [22] this latter finding is
not completely unexpected. However, because CCIC are a
minority of cells in tumors, the ability of Class I HDACi
to inhibit these cells as well as non-CCIC bulk CRC cells
is potentially important. Drugs inhibiting both CCIC and
non-CCIC CRC cell tumor formation such as MGCD0103
are anticipated to be particularly promising candidates to
take forward in CRC developmental therapeutic clinical

1 has a clearly established role as a canonical WNT
pathway inhibitor. Mutations in APC and less frequently
β-CATENIN and AXIN are known to cause constitutive
downstream signaling independent of upstream signals.
However recent reports have suggested that upstream
signaling from WNT inhibitors such as SFRP1, WIF1 and DKK-1 inhibit CRC cell growth even in presence
of downstream mutations [21]. In contrast to sFRPs
which decrease levels of β-CATENIN/LEF1 dependant
transcription even in cells carrying APC mutations, DKK1 has minimal effect on these targets [21]. Because the
CCIC lines we studied do not express WT APC, our study
provides new evidence that DKK-1 inhibits proliferation
through mechanisms that are independent of canonical
WNT signaling. In mesothelioma cells DKK-1 activates
the JNK pathway to induce apoptosis [23]. Since JNK
signaling increases intestinal tumorgenesis in mouse
models [24], future additional studies will be helpful to
understand the role of JNK and other anti-proliferative
mechanisms of DKK-1 in CCIC and non-CCIC CRC cells
that are independent of canonical WNT signaling.

separated by SDS/PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P
PVDF (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5%
nonfat dry milk and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with
specific primary antibodies for Acetyl H3K9 and Acetyl
H3K4 (Upstate Biotech) at dilutions recommended by the
manufacturer. Detection was carried out by peroxidase
based chemiluminesence and Dura West substrate (Pierce).

Gene expression profiling
Two CCIC lines were treated with MGCD0103
(0.71 µM) or TSA (200 nM) for 6h in quadruplicates and
RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Spin columns.
Expression profiling was carried out using total RNA
from CCIC lines on Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon
1.0 ST Array. RNA extraction, labeling, hybridization
and scanning were carried out according to recommended
protocols. The Cybet-T program was used to determine
statistically significant differentially expressed genes
compared to mock treated samples. Differentially
regulated genes were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis.

Materials and Methods:

RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR
MGCD0103 and TSA treatment of CCIC

Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy
Spin columns and reverse transcribed using ABI High
capacity cDNA kit. Taqman Assay on demand was used to
quantify gene expression on a ABI PRISM HT7900. Gene
expression was normalized using GAPDH or RPLPO.

CCIC were plated in 3D culture (DAY 0) and treated
with 0.7µM MGCD0103 (DAY 1) or 200nM TSA and
treated for 48h. Controls were treated with DMSO or
ethanol respectively. The cells were then cultured without
drug for another 14 days or upto 2 months to assay number
of colonies formed.
