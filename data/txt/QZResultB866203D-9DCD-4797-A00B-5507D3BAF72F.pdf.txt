ABSTRACT
Wolf-Hisrchhorn Syndrome Candidate 1-Like 1 (WHSC1L1) is a protein lysine
methyltransferase that is recurrently amplified (8p11.23) in patients with squamous
cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). In this study, we investigated the
oncogenic role of WHSC1L1 in SCCHN. Using immunohistochemistry on tissue
microarrays of patients with locoregionally advanced SCCHN, we found that WHSC1L1
is significantly overexpressed in patients with SCCHN, and is associated with poor
grade and heavy smoking history. Knockdown of WHSC1L1 expression resulted in
significant growth suppression and reduction of H3K36 dimethylation (H3K36me2)
in SCCHN cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that WHSC1L1 and
H3K36me2 are enriched in the gene bodies of the cell cycle-related genes CDC6 and
CDK2, implying that WHSC1L1 directly regulates the transcription of these genes.
According to the importance of CDC6 and CDK2 for G1 to S transition, WHSC1L1
knockdown induced strong G0/G1 arrest which was rescued by introduction of wildtype WHSC1L1 but not by that of enzyme-inactive WHSC1L1. Our results imply that
WHSC1L1 and its product H3K36me2 are essential for the transition from G1 to S
phase in SCCHN cells and that WHSC1L1 could serve as a rational target for anticancer
drug development for patients with head and neck cancer.

responses, most of them eventually progress through these
treatments and die of this disease. Thus, the continued
search for novel targets for anti-cancer drug development
is mandatory and truly urgent.
The Cancer Genome Atlas Consortium (TCGA)
[3, 4] has revealed a plethora of genetic and expression
alterations in a class of enzymes known as protein
methyltransferases (PMTs) in many different cancer
types, suggesting the importance of these enzymes in
cancer development and progression [5]. Specifically
in SCCHN, genetic analysis of 530 tumors showed
mutations, amplifications and deletions in approximately
68% of the samples. Interestingly, amongst the top two

INTRODUCTION
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
(SCCHN) is a significant public health concern estimated
to affect over 48,000 patients in 2016 in the United States
[1]. Chemoradiotherapy, cetuximab and platinum-based
chemotherapy are standard treatments [2] but many
patients eventually develop resistance through escape
pathways. Research efforts in the past three decades have
been focusing on the investigation of tyrosine kinase
inhibition and immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade,
which show promise in a personalized context. Although

most frequently altered enzyme families in SCCHN
were the NSD (nuclear SET-Suppressor of variegation
3-9, Enhancer of zeste and Trithorax-domain, NSD1,
NSD2/WHSC1/MMSET, NSD3/WHSC1L1) family of
protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs) which are
genetically altered in 28% of SCCHN, implying a critical
role for these enzymes in SCCHN oncogenesis [3, 4]. A
similar frequency of genetic alterations in NSD PKMTs
is also observed in lung squamous cell carcinoma, a
disease with very similar genetic background as SCCHN.
Among these enzymes, TCGA reported a statistically
significant, recurrent amplification of WHSC1L1 at
chromosome 8p11.23 region in 9.3% of SCCHN tumors
(Q-value=3.7e-15). Importantly, WHSC1L1 seems to
be the only recurrently amplified PKMT in SCCHN.
In addition, no studies have investigated the role of
WHSC1L1 in the pathogenesis of SCCHN.
WHSC1L1, also known as Wolf-Hirschhorn
syndrome candidate 1-like 1, is a nuclear protein mapped
at chromosome 8p11.23 and is known to function as
a chromatin modifier by modulating the expression of
genes through dimethylation of lysine 36 on histone H3
(H3K36me2). It shares 70-75% homology in aminoacid sequence with the other two members of the NSD
family and contains a SET domain that possesses
methyltransferase activity [6, 7]. There are two major
WHSC1L1 isoforms, the long WHSC1L1 (1437aa) and
the short WHSC1L1 (645aa), which share a common
620aa N-terminal region, while the short WHSC1L1 lacks
the SET domain.
Given that WHSC1L1 is recurrently amplified in
SCCHN and that few studies have explored the role of
PKMTs in SCCHN [8], we aimed to evaluate its potential
function as an oncogenic force in this disease, and to
elucidate relevant mechanisms of its oncogenic activity.
In this study, we show that WHSC1L1 is significantly
overexpressed in patients with SCCHN, its knockdown
causes cell-cycle arrest and decrease in global H3K36
dimethylation levels, and that it promotes the coordinated
transcription of a number of cell cycle genes, including
CDK2 and CDC6, which are critical for the G1/S
transition. These results highlight the promising role of
WHSC1L1 as a therapeutic target in SCCHN.

tissue as baseline reference was performed. Clinical
information was also available for 105 patients examined
for WHSC1L1. Figure 1A shows representative examples
of SCCHN sections stained at different IHC scores
(4-scale grading: 0, +1, +2, +3), with normal buccal
mucosal epithelium demonstrating only weak staining
in the nucleus of the cells. WHSC1L1 was localized
predominantly in the nucleus, but weak staining was also
observed in the cytoplasm. WHSC1L1 was significantly
overexpressed in SCCHN (n=132) compared to normal
squamous (n=19) and dysplastic (n=18) epithelium
(P=0.0074 and P=0.022 respectively, Wilcoxon Rank
sum test). Similarly, the percentage of samples with strong
(+3) expression of WHSC1L1 increased significantly from
0% to 6% from normal to dyplastic epithelium, and then
to 25% in SCCHN (P=0.0032, Cochrane-Armitage test)
(Figure 1B). IHC scoring revealed moderate or strong
nuclear staining (+2, +3) in 58% of SCCHN samples, and
absent or weak (0, +1) staining in 42% of the samples,
while 74% of the normal epithelium samples stained
weakly for WHSC1L1.
Given that WHSC1 was also reported to be
significantly overexpressed in SCCHN [14], we assessed
the correlation between expression levels of WHSC1L1
and WHSC1 in SCCHN samples and found them to
be only mildly correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient ρ=0.37, P<0.001), suggesting that WHSC1
and WHSC1L1 may function as independent drivers of
SCCHN oncogenesis.
We then proceeded to assess correlations of
WHSC1L1 expression with various clinicopathological
parameters, such as overall and progression-free survival,
age, gender, primary site, tumor size (T), nodal stage
(N), TNM stage, grade, smoking history and human
papilloma virus status in SCCHN patients with local or
locoregionally advanced disease who were treated with
either surgery with or without adjuvant chemoradiation, or
definitive chemoradiation. A summary of the data is shown
in Table 1. The analysis revealed significant correlation
of high WHSC1L1 expression levels (+2, +3 IHC score)
with poor differentiation grade (Figure 1C) and heavier
smoking history (Figure 1D). More specifically, 81% of
patients with poor differentiation grade had significantly
higher WHSC1L1, compared to 31% of patients with well
differentiated SCCHN (logistic regression, P=0.004). In
addition, 70% of patients with heavy smoking history (>40
pack/years) had significantly higher WHSC1L1 staining
compared to 49% of patients with less than 29 pack/years
of smoking history and this difference was statistically
significant (logistic regression, P=0.021). No statistically
significant associations with age, gender, primary site,
HPV status, tumor stage, or nodal stage were found. No
associations with overall and progression-free survival
were found either, though this study was not powered to
detect survival differences.

carcinoma cell lines and its knockdown decreases
cell viability

Figure S2) and cell viability was measured by an MTT
assay (Cell Counting Kit-8) on day 6 of siRNA treatment.
Knockdown of WHSC1L1 significantly decreased the
viability of both the HPV-positive and the two HPVnegative SCCHN cell lines (Figure 2C). The data above
support that WHSC1L1 knockdown decreases the cell
proliferation and/or survival of SCCHN cells.

To assess the expression pattern of WHSC1L1
in SCCHN cell lines, mRNA expression analysis of
WHSC1L1 was performed in a panel of 12 SCCHN
cell lines (Supplementary Table S1). Significant
overexpression of WHSC1L1 was observed in 6 of
12 (50%) SCCHN cell lines compared to a normal
keratinocyte cell line (KGM) used as a control (Figure
2A). Western blotting analysis for WHSC1L1 was
also performed in 9 SCCHN cell lines and revealed
overexpression of WHSC1L1 (162kD) in 2 of 9 SCCHN
cell lines (22%) (Supplementary Figure S1). To examine
the importance of WHSC1L1 in cell proliferation and
survival, RNA interference experiments were conducted
in a HPV-positive (UD-SCC-2) and two HPV-negative cell
lines (YD-10B and HN13) with endogenous WHSC1L1
overexpression, using two different WHSC1L1-specific
siRNAs (siWHSC1L1#1 and siWHSC1L1#2) and a
control siRNA (siNC). Knockdown of WHSC1L1 was
confirmed at the protein level (Figure 2B, Supplementary

WHSC1L1 induces H3K36 dimethylation in
SCCHN cells
To assess whether WHSC1L1 induces H3K36
dimethylation in SCCHN cells, we performed knockdown
experiments of WHSC1L1 in YD-10B and HN13
SCCHN cells using two WHSC1L1 specific siRNAs
(siWHSC1L1#1 and siWHSC1L1#2). After 3 days of
siRNA treatment, a decrease in dimethylated H3K36
was observed in both cell lines treated with WHSC1L1
specific siRNAs compared to control siRNA (Figure 3A).
To validate this finding in an overexpression system, 293T
cells with endogenously low expression of WHSC1L1
were transfected with HA-WHSC1L1-WT (wild type) and
HA-WHSC1L1-ΔSET (enzyme-inactive WHSC1L1) for

WHSC1L1 regulates the transcription of cell
cycle genes CDK2 and CDC6 through H3K36
dimethylation

48h, and nuclear extracts were blotted for dimethylated
H3K36. Results showed higher levels of dimethylated
H3K36 protein levels in 293T cells transfected with the
wild type WHSC1L1 than those with enzyme-inactive
WHSC1L1 (Figure 3B), indicating that WHSC1L1
regulates the levels of H3K36 dimethylation in SCCHN
cells.

To identify genes regulated by WHSC1L1 in
SCCHN cells, we performed a cDNA microarray in two
SCCHN cell lines (UD-SCC-2, YD-10B) after treatment

of cells with a control siRNA (siNC) and two WHSC1L1
specific siRNAs (siWHSC1L1#1 and siWHSC1L1#2).
cDNA microarray analysis revealed significant
downregulation of 93 genes by more than 50% in both UDSCC-2 and YD-10B cells after knockdown of WHSC1L1
(Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, among these we
found four genes necessary for progression of the cell
cycle from the G1 to the S phase, cell division cycle 6
(CDC6), cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), cyclin D1
(CCND1) and cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A). KEGG
(Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway
analysis confirmed enrichment in the “cell cycle” function
(Supplementary Figure S3). CDC6 is a protein kinase
that is required for the initiation of DNA replication
[9] and has been shown to promote the development of
malignant behavior and DNA hyperreplication [10, 11].
CDK2 is a serine/threonine protein kinase which binds to
cyclin E and promotes the E2F transcriptional program,
thus allowing transition to the S phase [12]. CCND1
is a well known oncogene which forms a complex and
functions as a regulator of CDK4 and CDK6, mediating

G1 to S phase transition. CDC25A is a dual-specificity
protein phosphatase of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK2,
CDK4 and CDK6 (CDKs) which positively regulates their
activity towards G1 to S phase progression [13]. Given the
frequent deregulation of these genes in cancer and their
necessary role in DNA replication, they have attracted
significant attention as potential anticancer targets.
We further validated the expression levels of CDC6,
CDK2, CCND1 and CDC25A as potential downstream
targets of WHSC1L1 by performing quantitative realtime PCR in UD-SCC-2 and YD-10B cells (Figure 3C,
Supplementary Figure S4). We confirmed downregulation
of CDC6 and CDK2 at the mRNA, as well as at the
protein level in three SCCHN cell lines, YD-10B, UDSCC-2 and HN13 cells, transfected with two WHSC1L1
specific siRNAs (Figure 3D). However, we could not
confirm decrease of CCND1 and CDC25A at the protein
level for either cell line. Based on the above, we decided
to concentrate our further analysis on CDC6 and CDK2.
To evaluate whether WHSC1L1 directly
regulates the transcription of CDC6 and CDK2 through

assays were performed on day 6 of siRNA treatment. Statistically significant reduction of cell viability was observed in the WHSC1L1specific siRNA-treated cells compared to the siNC-treated cells (* P<0.05, Student’s t-test, data represented as mean+/-SEM).

t-test) (Figure 3E). These results support that both CDC6
and CDK2 are transcriptionally regulated directly by
WHSC1L1 through induction of H3K36 dimethylation in
SCCHN cells. Consistently, the protein levels of CDK2
and CDC6 were decreased in 293T cells overexpressing
HA-WHSC1L1-ΔSET (enzyme-inactive WHSC1L1)
compared to cells overexpressing wild type WHSC1L1
(Figure 3F), further indicating that the methyltransferase
activity of WHSC1L1 is necessary for the transcriptional
regulation of CDC6 and CDK2 by WHSC1L1.

H3K36 dimethylation, we performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using ChIP-grade
antibodies for WHSC1L1 and H3K36me2, targeting the
gene body of each of CDC6 and CDK2 with 4 different
primer sets. To this purpose, we used a gain-of-function
system of 293T cells which were transfected with HAMock and HA-WHSC1L1 (wild type) vectors for 48h.
CDC6 levels in WHSC1L1-immunoprecipitants were
increased by 42 times in the HA-WHSC1L1 wild type
transfected 293T cells compared with HA-Mock cells
(P<0.0001, Student’s t-test). Similarly, a 4-fold increase
of CDC6 was observed in the H3K36me2-enriched cell
lysates (P=0.0002, Student’s t-test). We also observed
an increase in the CDK2 levels by 26 times in the
WHSC1L1-immunoprecipitants of the lysates from HAWHSC1L1 wild type transfected 293T cells (P=0.01,

leads to arrest of the cell cycle progression from G1 to
S phase. To investigate this hypothesis, we transfected
UD-SCC-2 and YD-10B cells with control siRNA (siNC)
and a WHSC1L1 specific siRNA (siWHSC1L1#1)
for 72h and synchronized the cell cycle at the G0/G1
phase with 48 hours of aphidicholin incubation. After
releasing the cell cycle, we performed flow cytometric
analysis at 6h and 12h which revealed a marked decrease
of the S phase and a concordant increase in the G0/G1
phase cells in both cell lines treated with siWHSC1L1
compared with those treated with control siRNA (Figure
4A). To further validate that this phenotype was due to
knockdown of WHSC1L1 and was not mediated by
an off-target effect of the siRNA treatment, we then

performed a rescue experiment by transfecting YD-10B
cells with an siRNA targeting the 3’-untranslated region
of WHSC1L1 (3’UTR) which was confirmed to knock
down the long WHSC1L1 isoform (Supplementary
Figure S5). At 24h of the 3’UTR WHSC1L1 siRNA
transfection, we transduced the cells with HA-WHSC1L1
wild type vector, of which the WHSC1L1 transcript did
not correspond to the 3’UTR siRNA, versus an enzymeinactive HA-WHSC1L1ΔSET vector for 48h. Flow
cytometric analysis at 72h revealed that the percentage
of S-phase cells was decreased from 35% in the siNC
group transfected with HA-WHSC1L1ΔSET to 8% in the
si3’UTR group transfected with HA-WHSC1L1ΔSET, but
only from 27% to 25% in the siNC/HA-WHSC1L1 group

cytometry was performed using the BD Pharmigen cell cycle flow cytometry kit. Results are shown for 6h and 12h after cell cycle release for
UD-SCC-2 and YD-10B cells respectively. In UD-SCC-2 cells, S phase cells were decreased from 35% to 5%, with a concordant increase
in the G0-G1 cells from 58% to 89%. In YD-10B cells, S phase cells were decreased from 44% to 1% and G0-G1 cells were increased from
51% to 96%. These results were reproduced in duplicates with unsynchronized cell cycle analysis. B. YD-10B cells were transfected with
a siRNA targeting the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of the long WHSC1L1 isoform for 72h. At 24h of siRNA transfection, cells were
transfected with HA-WHSC1L1 WT or enzyme-inactive HA-WHSC1L1ΔSET vectors for 48h. Cell cycle flow cytometry was performed
after 72h of siRNA transfection. Results revealed that suppression of the S phase occurred in the si# 3’UTR cells transfected with the HAWHSC1L1ΔSET vector, but was recovered in cells transfected with the HA-WHSC1L1 WT vector. Histographic representation of these
results is included.

compared to the si3’UTR/HA-WHSC1L1 group. These
findings support that the HA-WHSC1L1 wild type vector,
but not the enzyme-inactive one, rescued the S phase
progression in the cells transfected with the si3’UTR
WHSC1L1 (Figure 4B). The observation that there was no
rescue of the S phase in cells transfected with the enzymeinactive HA-WHSC1L1ΔSET vector indicates that the
methyltransferase activity of WHSC1L1 incurred by the
SET domain is necessary for augmentation of the S phase
in SCCHN cells. These results support that WHSC1L1 is
necessary for the transition of SCCHN cells from the G1
to the S phase through its H3K36 dimethylation activity.

demonstrated high expression levels. The discrepant
percentage of 9.3% amplification frequency of WHSC1L1
in SCCHN implies that additional mechanisms, such as
transcriptional upregulation and/or increased protein
stability, may contribute to the high expression protein
levels of WHSC1L1 in SCCHN tissues. WHSC1L1
expression increased significantly in the transformation
process from normal epithelial to dysplastic cells and
further to SCCHN cells and is associated with heavier
smoking history and poorly differentiated SCCHN. To
our knowledge, there is only one study [19] that assessed
the association between WHSC1L1 protein levels and
various clinicopathological parameters in bladder cancer,
but found no correlations, including smoking history
and grade. Though tumor grade is not known to affect
prognosis, heavy smoking history is associated with worse
survival in SCCHN. The association between heavier
smoking and increased WHSC1L1 protein expression
levels raises an interesting and significant question. A
biological possibility to explain this association is that
smoking may induce genetic instability which in turn
may be associated with gene amplifications, including
WHSC1L1 which may be selected due to its oncogenic
function. To this purpose, future investigations comparing
the 8p11.23 amplification frequency between dysplastic
epithelial samples of subjects with heavy versus no
smoking history would be worth pursuing.
Furthermore, we have shown that WHSC1L1
knockdown decreases the viability of SCCHN cells. We
have also demonstrated that WHSC1L1 induces global
H3K36 dimethylation changes in SCCHN cells and it
directly regulates the transcription of cell cycle-related
genes CDC6 and CDK2, probably through enhancement of
H3K36 dimethylation. In accordance with the critical roles
of CDC6 and CDK2 in the cell cycle progression to the
S-phase, WHSC1L1 knockdown led to marked decrease
of the S phase, a phenotype which was rescued with
introduction of WHSC1L1, but not with that of enzymeinactive WHSC1L1. CDC6 is a protein kinase essential
for the initiation of DNA replication, in that its ATPase
activity is vital for the assembly of the origin recognition
complex, CDT1 and MCM2-7 helicase at replication
origins to form pre-replication complexes that initiate
DNA replication during the G1 phase of the cell division
cycle [9, 23]. CDK2 is critical for the transition from the
G1 to the S phase by binding to cyclin E and promoting
the E2F transcriptional program and the initiation of DNA
synthesis [12]. Inhibition of CDK2 in ovarian cancer
cells overexpressing cyclin E has also been shown to
significantly suppress cancer cell proliferation [20]. The
above underline the necessity and importance of these cell
cycle genes in the proliferation of cancer cells.
Taking the above into consideration, as well as
the very low expression levels of WHSC1L1 in normal
tissues [19], WHSC1L1 may serve as a promising

DISCUSSION
WHSC1L1 is a protein lysine methyltransferase
that is recurrently amplified in SCCHN, as well as
many other cancer types, such as bladder, breast, and
lung squamous cell carcinomas. In addition to SCCHN,
WHSC1L1 is frequently amplified in human breast
cancer cell lines [14] and in 13% of breast cancer samples
[3, 4], and high WHSC1L1 mRNA levels have been
associated with worse survival in breast cancer patients
[15]. Knockdown of WHSC1L1 in 8p11.23 amplified
breast cancer cell lines reduced the growth of cancer cells,
and concordantly overexpression of WHSC1L1 in nontransformed mammary epithelial cells led to the formation
of disorganized acini [16]. The TCGA database has also
described frequent WHSC1L1 amplification in bladder
cancer (11%) and squamous cell carcinoma of the lung
(21%). Furthermore, the t(8;11) translocation generating
the NUP98-NSD3 fusion product has been described in
acute myeloid leukemia [17] and in chemotherapy-related
myelodysplastic syndrome [18], further suggesting
its function as an oncogene. Preclinical studies have
underlined the importance of WHSC1L1 in the cell
growth and survival of lung, bladder and breast cancer
cell lines [7, 19, 20], though the detailed mechanisms
of its action are largely unknown. More recently, Shen
et al [21] showed that BRD4, which is necessary for the
maintenance of the malignant phenotype of AML, requires
the PWWP domain of the short WHSC1L1 isoform as an
adapter protein which links BRD4 to the CHD8 chromatin
remodeler, while all of these proteins are co-localized in
the AML genome and are released from super-enhancer
regions through BET bromodomain chemical inhibition.
WHSC1L1 was also reported to interact with BRD4
through the fusion product WHSC1L1-NUT (NSD3-NUT)
observed in a rare squamous cell malignancy known as
NUT midline carcinoma, while these cells underwent
growth arrest and differentiation upon treatment with the
bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 [22].
This study has shown that WHSC1L1 is significantly
overexpressed in SCCHN compared to normal epithelium,
and that 58% of locoregionally advanced SCCHN tumors

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Immunohistochemistry in head and neck cancer
tissue microarrays
The expression pattern of WHSC1L1 in 154
SCCHN, 19 dysplastic and 18 normal epithelial tissue
sections were examined by immunohistochemistry.
SCCHN sections were derived from biopsies of patients
with local or locoregionally advanced disease previous
to treatment with either surgery with or without adjuvant
chemoradiation, or definitive chemoradiation. Slides
of paraffin-embedded squamous cell carcinoma tumor
specimens, dysplastic and normal epithelial tissues were
deparaffinized, rehydrated and sections were treated
with antigen retrieval buffer (pH 6, S2367, DAKO,
Carpinteria, CA) in a steamer for 20 min at 96°C. AntiWHSC1L1 antibody (11345-1-AP, Proteintech, Rosemont,
IL, dilution 1:400) was applied on tissue sections for one
hour incubation at room temperature. Following TBS
wash, the antigen-antibody binding was detected with the
Bond Refine polymer detection system (DS9800, Leica
Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and DAB+ chromogen
(DAKO, K3468). Tissue sections were briefly immersed
in hematoxylin for counterstaining and were covered with
cover glasses. An expert head and neck cancer pathologist
and an additional reviewer blinded to clinical outcomes
performed semi-quantitative analysis of WHSC1L1
staining using a four-grade scale defined as follows:
negative, grade 0; mild, grade +1; moderate, grade +2; and
strong staining intensity, grade +3. This methodology was
chosen based on the observation that WHSC1L1 staining
was observed to be homogeneous in each tissue sample.
Use of tissues was approved by the University of Chicago
Institutional Review Board (IRB 12-2125 and IRB 122117).

Expression vector construction
An entire coding sequence of WHSC1L1 (GenBank
NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_023034.1) was
amplified from human testis cDNAs using KOD-PlusNeo (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) DNA polymerase and
cloned into pCAGGSn3FC vector between NotI and XhoI
restriction enzyme sites (pCAGGS-WT WHSC1L1-HA).
To prepare an enzyme-inactive WHSC1L1, the coding
sequence of the SET domain was deleted from the entire
coding sequence of WHSC1L1 (pCAGGS-WHSC1L1ΔSET-HA).

Quantitative real-time PCR
Specific primers for human GAPDH (housekeeping
gene), SDH (housekeeping gene), WHSC1L1, CDK2,
CDC6 were designed (primer sequences in Supplementary
Table S3). PCR reactions were performed using ViiA 7
real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) following the manufacture’s protocol.

Western blotting
Nuclear extracts were prepared using the Nuclear
Extract kit (Active Motif) to examine protein levels of
WHSC1L1, and cytoplasmic extracts using the NEPER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction kit (78833,
ThermoFisher Scientific) were obtained to examine
protein levels of cytoplasmic CDK2, CDC6 and ACTB.
Primary antibodies used were anti-WHSC1L1 (11345-1AP, Proteintech, dilution: 1:5000), anti-CDK2 (#2546, Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, dilution: 1:1000),
anti-CDC6 (#3387, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA, 1:1000), anti-ACTB (A5441, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, dilution: 1:5000) and anti-HA (H6908, SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, dilution 1:2000). For detection
of histone marks, nuclear extracts were prepared using
the Nuclear Extract kit (Active Motif) and 2.5 μg of each
extract was loaded for each experiment. Antibodies used
were anti-H3K36me2 (07-369, Merck Millipore, dilution:
1:10000), and anti-H3 (ab1791, Abcam, Cambridge, UK,
dilution: 1:50000).

Cell culture
Squamous cell carcinoma cell lines UD-SCC2,
SCC-23, SCC-25, SCC-35, HN-SCC-151, PE/CA-PJ15,
FaDu, JSQ-3, HN-5, HN-6, HN13, YD-10B were derived
from patients with locoregionally advanced SCCHN and
were kindly provided by Dr. Tanguy Seiwert (University
of Chicago). Detailed characteristics of each cell line are
shown in Supplementary Table S1. UD-SCC-2, SCC23, SCC-25, SCC-35, HN-SCC-151 and JSQ-3 were
maintained in DMEM/F12 medium, 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 nM L-glutamine.
PE/CA-PJ15 was maintained in IDMEM, 10% fetal bovine
serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 nM L-glutamine.

siRNA transfection and cell growth assays

were incubated with DNAase for 1 h at 37°C and FITCconjugated anti-BrdU antibody (dilution: 1:50) was
added for 20 min at room temperature. Total DNA
was stained with 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD),
followed by flow cytometric analysis. This analysis was
performed in YD-10B and UD-SCC-2 cells.

MISSION_ siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes were
purchased from Sigma–Aldrich for targeting the human
WHSC1L1 transcripts (SASI_Hs01_00082045 and
SASI_Hs01_00082044). siNegative control (siNC), which
consists of three different oligonucleotide duplexes, were
used as control siRNAs (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan). The
siRNA sequences are described in Supplementary Table
S3. SCCHN cells were plated overnight in 24-well plates
(2-4 x 104 cells/well) and were transfected with siRNA
duplexes (50 nM final concentration) using Lipofectamine
RNAimax (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 144 h (6 days)
with retransfection performed at day 4. The number of
viable cells was measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8
(Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) on day 6 [24].

Microarray hybridization and statistical analysis
UD-SCC2 and YD-10B cells were plated in 10cm
dishes and treated with two different WHSC1L1 specific
siRNAs (50nM, SASI_Hs01_00082045 and SASI_
Hs01_00082044) and a negative control siRNA (siNC) for
48h. Purified total RNA isolated from these samples was
labeled and hybridized onto Affymetrix GeneChip U133
Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (33-35).
Probe signal intensities were normalized by Affymetrix
MAS5 algorithm (Expression Console™ Software).
In order to compare the signal intensity between two
different samples with accuracy, we only used the data
whose P-value is less than 0.05; up-regulation means the
intensity ratio is more than 3 and down-regulation means
the intensity ratio is less than 0.5.

ChIP assays
ChIP assays were performed using ChIP Assay kit
(17-295, Merck Millipore) according to the manufacture’s
protocol. Briefly, WHSC1L1 and fragmented chromatin
complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-WHSC1L1
(11345-1-AP, Proteintech, dilution: 1: 50) and antiH3K36me2 (07-369, Merck Millipore, dilution: 1:100)
antibodies 48 h after transfection of YD-10B cells with
siRNAs for WHSC1L1 (SASI_Hs01_00082045). The
same procedure was followed in 293T cells transfected
with HA-Mock and HA-WHSC1L1 vectors for 48h. DNA
fragments were quantified by real-time PCR using CDK2ChIP forward primer (5’-TGG TGG CGG TCG GGA
ACT CGG TG-3’) and reverse (5’- GGA AAC AGG GCC
CAG TAC CGT GG-3’) primers, CDC6-ChIP forward
(5’- GAG CGC GGC TGG AGT TTG CTG CTG-3’) and
reverse (5’-CAG GAT CCT TCT CAC GTC TCT CAC3’) primers, and CCND1-ChIP forward (5’- CAC ACG
GAC TAC AGG GGA GTT TTG-3’) and reverse (5’GGA GCG TGC GGA CTC TGC TGC TCG-3’) primers.

Statistical analysis
Spearman rank correlation coefficients were
calculated to assess associations between WHSC1L1
and WHSC1 expression levels (using the 4-point IHC
scale). Comparison of WHSC1L1 expression levels were
compared among tumor, dysplasia, and normal samples
using the Wilcoxon rank sum test and the CochranArmitage trend test. Clinicopathological correlations
were performed in a retrospective manner. Expression
levels were dichotomized as 0-1 vs. 2-3 and logistic
regression models fit to examine the association between
IHC score and gender, age, smoking history, stage,
T-stage, N-stage, grade, and HPV status. Cox regression
[25] was performed to examine whether WHSC1L1
was prognostic for overall or progression-free survival.
Student’s t-test was performed to compare continuous
outcome variables in different groups from the cell line
experiments.

Cell cycle analysis assays
The 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU) flow kit
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) was used to determine
the cell cycle kinetics. The assay was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
cells were seeded overnight in 10cm tissue culture
dishes and treated with siRNAs targeting WHSC1L1
(50 nM, SASI_Hs01_00082045) described as above
using medium with 10% FBS without antibiotics for
72h, followed by addition of 10 μM BrdU. At 24h of
transfection, medium was suctioned and repleted with
medium containing aphidicholin (5μg/mL) for 48h to
achieve cell cycle synchronization at the G0/G1 phase.
At 72h, cells were released from aphidicholin and were
exposed to BrdU at different cell cycle time points
(0h, 6h, 12h, 24h). Cells were then fixed in a solution
containing paraformaldehyde and saponin. Then samples
