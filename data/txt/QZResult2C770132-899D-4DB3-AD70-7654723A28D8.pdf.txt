Abstract
CCDC6 gene product is a pro-apoptotic protein substrate of ATM, whose loss
or inactivation enhances tumour progression. In primary tumours, the impaired
function of CCDC6 protein has been ascribed to CCDC6 rearrangements and to somatic
mutations in several neoplasia. Recently, low levels of CCDC6 protein, in NSCLC, have
been correlated with tumor prognosis. However, the mechanisms responsible for the
variable levels of CCDC6 in primary tumors have not been described yet.
We show that CCDC6 turnover is regulated in a cell cycle dependent manner.
CCDC6 undergoes a cyclic variation in the phosphorylated status and in protein levels
that peak at G2 and decrease in mitosis. The reduced stability of CCDC6 in the M phase
is dependent on mitotic kinases and on degron motifs that are present in CCDC6 and
direct the recruitment of CCDC6 to the FBXW7 E3 Ubl. The de-ubiquitinase enzyme
USP7 appears responsible of the fine tuning of the CCDC6 stability, affecting cells
behaviour and drug response.
Thus, we propose that the amount of CCDC6 protein in primary tumors, as
reported in lung, may depend on the impairment of the CCDC6 turnover due to altered
protein-protein interaction and post-translational modifications and may be critical
in optimizing personalized therapy.

emerged as an important regulatory mechanism in a
range of cellular processes [17]. DUBs activity may be
considered as important as the E3-ubiquitin ligases in
cancer development, underscoring the dynamic and
reversible nature of protein ubiquitylation. Several DUBs
have been found to function in the DNA damage response,
including ubiquitin-specific protease 1 (USP1), USP7
and USP28 [18, 19]. USP7 (also known as HAUSP) is
a DUB for several tumor suppressors [20]. Lately, USP7
has been predicted as a major DUB for CCDC6 [21].
Here, we investigated if USP7 is specifically able to
interact with CCDC6, controlling the CCDC6 stability
and counteracting the FBXW7-mediated ubiquitylation of
the protein.
In this work we have analysed the post-translational
modifications and the mechanisms regulating CCDC6
protein turnover during cell cycle progression in order to
establish whether the increased degradation or the reduced
stability of CCDC6 might drive a different sensitivity to
PARP inhibitors in cancer cells.

of the cell cycle checkpoint pathways in maintaining
genomic integrity is highlighted by the observation that
loss, inactivation, or epigenetic silencing of checkpoint
genes is frequently observed in cancer. Deletion of
checkpoint genes has been shown to cause genomic
instability and predisposition to transformation [6, 3].
Indeed, loss of DNA damage checkpoints, during early
stages of tumorigenesis, may facilitate the acquisition
of additional mutations over the time, determining
aggressiveness and drug response in tumors.
In previous work we documented that CCDC6 acts
as a pro-apoptotic protein substrate of ATM, to sustain
DNA damage checkpoints in response to genotoxic events
[7, 8]. Moreover, CCDC6 protects genome integrity
by modulating the activity of the phosphatase PP4C
directed towards the de-phosphorylation on S139 of the
histone H2AX (γH2AX) in response to DNA damage
[9]. Consistent with these observations, we reported that
CCDC6 deficiency affects the γH2AX foci formation
and the repair of the DNA DSBs [9]. Thus, CCDC6 is an
attractive candidate biomarker whose loss or inactivation
could enhance tumor progression by impairing apoptosis
thereby favoring cell survival and allowing the cells to
overcome the barrier of a DNA damage response. The
CCDC6 gene was originally identified because of its
rearrangement with the RET tyrosine kinase in thyroid
tumors [10], and with genes other than RET in non-solid
tumors [11]. In most cancers that harbor the CCDC6
gene rearrangements, the product of the normal allele of
CCDC6 is either wholly absent or functionally impaired
by a dominant negative mechanism [7]. Moreover,
CCDC6 sporadic mutations have been reported in ovary
and large intestine tumors (www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/
CGP/cosmic). Recently, CCDC6-RET fusions and CCDC6
point mutations [N394Y, T462A, S351Y, E227K] have
been reported in NSCLC [12, 13]. Defective expression of
CCDC6 has been observed in about 30% of NSCLC and
negatively correlated to DFS and OS [14]. Importantly, in
NSCLC cells, the defective expression of CCDC6 causes
an impaired DNA repair by homologous recombination
(HR), making these cells sensitive to PARP inhibitors. The
concurrent treatment of cisplatinum and PARP inhibitors
has shown a synergistic effect in CCDC6 deficient NSCLC
cells [14].
CCDC6 has been recently recognized as a novel
target of the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXW7 for ubiquitinmediated proteasomal degradation [15].
The ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway
plays an important role in controlling the abundance
of intracellular proteins and plays an essential role in
maintaining normal cellular function, including the cell
cycle. Deregulation of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis
results in the development of a variety of human cancers
[16].

RESULTS
CCDC6 levels are regulated in a cell cycle
dependent manner by phosphorylation events
To investigate the regulation of CCDC6 protein
levels during the cell cycle, human HeLa cells were
synchronised at the G1/S boundary using a double
thymidine (TT) block, then released into the cell cycle.
The time course experiment showed several posttranslational modifications of CCDC6 protein at different
time points (Figure 1A). In order to better discern the
CCDC6 behaviour during the cell cycle, we utilized
different chemical treatments to block the cells in specific
phases. We observed a cyclic variation of CCDC6 levels
that increased at boundary G1/S, picked at G2, and
appeared upshifted in mitotic phase (Figure 1B). In order
to focus on the CCDC6 modifications in mitosis, HeLa
cells were then treated with nocodazole for 16 h, collected
by shake-off, plated again and analyzed at different time
points for a mitotic time course. The product of CCDC6
appeared as multiple bands on SDS-page gels at time 0,
from the nocodazole release. The shifts were maintained
up to 2 hours, while they disappeared at 4, 8 and 10 hours
when the protein seemed to be stabilized (Figure 1C).
Calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) treatment determined a
significant decrease of the shifted bands at time 0, thus
suggesting that the modifications observed in mitosis
might depend on phosphorylation events (Figure 1D).
The specific inhibition of cyclin–dependent kinase 1
(CDK1) by RO3306 reverted most of the shifts observed
by electrophoresis. In addition, the pretreatment with the
specific inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3),
12698

SB216763, also reverted the modifications detected for
CCDC6 in mitosis (Figure 1E).
We maintained the CCDC6 mitotic phosphorylation
status by keeping the cells in nocodazole for additional 2, 4
and 6 hours, after a pretreatment of 16 hours. The addition
of the CDK1 inhibitor RO3306, during the nocodazole
maintenance, impeded the CCDC6 post-translational
modifications that occurred in mitosis, suggesting that
CCDC6 is kept in the phosphorylated status mainly by
CDK1 (Figure 2A). At 2 and 4 hours from nocodazole
release the non-phosphorylated status of CCDC6 was
mildly reverted by the okadaic acid addition suggesting
that the activity of the mitotic kinases keeps the CCDC6
phosphorylation status in mitosis as well as phosphatases
contribute to regulate the CCDC6 phosphorylation status
at mitotic exit (Figure 2B). In mitotic cells, treated with
the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (up to 4 hours), CCDC6
shows a reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE suggesting that

in these conditions CCDC6 is stuck in a phosphorylated
status (Figure 2C). The MG132 treatment causes a reduced
degradation of cyclin B1 that maintain CDK1 active on
newly synthetized CCDC6 [22].

CCDC6 gene product binds CDK1 and GSK3
mitotic kinases
We wanted to investigate if CCDC6 was able to
interact with the mitotic kinases, whose inhibitors reverted
the CCDC6 phosphorylation observed in mitosis. To
this aim we performed a S-protein pull-down in mitotic
HeLa Kyoto cells, stably expressing S-tag-GFP-CCDC6
construct [23]. By this experiment we identified a specific
interaction between CCDC6 and endogenous cyclin B1, a
component of the CDK1-cyclinB complex. Moreover, the
mitotic pull down showed that CCDC6 was also able to
interact with the GSK3 kinase (Figure 2D). Interestingly,

Figure 1: CCDC6 protein levels are regulated through the cell cycle. A) CCDC6 levels increase from G1 to mitosis. Human
HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by double thymidine block (TT block), then released into the cell cycle. Samples
were analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using the specific antibodies at the times shown after release from the block. B) HeLa
cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by TT block, at the G2 phase by the CDK1 inhibitor RO3306, in mitosis after treatment
with 100 ng/ml nocodazole (Noco) for 16 hours. Floating cells were separated from adherent and samples were analysed by immunoblot
using the anti-CCDC6 antibody. C) Human HeLa cells were treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 hours. Floating, mitotic cells, were
separated from adherent (interphase) cells, plated again and samples were taken at the indicated times and analysed by immunoblotting
using the indicated antibodies. D) HeLa cells were synchronized as in C and collected at time 0. Extracts were treated in vitro with CIP, as
indicated. Therefore, samples were taken and analysed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Anti-MPM2 is utilized as indicator
of mitotic arrest. E) HeLa cells were synchronized as in C, and cells were treated with RO3306 (9 μM for 2 hours) or with SB216763 (10
μM for 4 hours) before the nocodazole release, as indicated. Samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using the indicated
antibodies.

the endogenous CCDC6, that is likely to be pulled down
by the heterodimerization with the S-tag-CCDC6 protein,
appeared to be shifted as well on the gel in the mitotic
lysate. Moreover, the hybridization with the phosphoantibody anti-MPM2, originally cloned on the basis of
its ability to recognize mitotic phosphorylated residues
on Cdk1/2 consensus motifs [22; 24-26], clearly showed
immunoreactivity for CCDC6 in a pull down performed
on mitotic extracts (Figure 2D). CCDC6 truncated mutants
[(1-101) and (1-223)] did not show CCDC6 protein shifts
after nocodazole release, suggesting that the target residues
of the mitotic kinases may be located downstream of the
aminoacid 223 in the CCDC6 sequence (Supplementary
Figure 1). Several Serine/Threonine consensus for
both CDK1 and GSK3 mitotic kinases (http://scansite.
mit.edu) have been predicted in the CCDC6 protein

sequence. We performed a CCDC6 pull-down in mitotic
extracts from HeLa Kyoto S-tag-GFP-CCDC6 cells
overexpressing CDK1 or GSK3. In pull-down of cells
overexpressing CDK1 we detected a predominant
immunoreactivity for phosphoserine residues of CCDC6,
while in pull-down from cells overexpressing GSK3
kinase we observed a predominant immunoreactivity of
the phosphothreonine residues of CCDC6. By treating the
cells with RO3306 or SB216763 we were able to impede
prevalently the recognition of CCDC6 phosphorylated
residues, respectively, by antiphosphoserine and the
antiphosphothreonine antibodies. These data support
the idea that in mitosis the phosphoserine residues of
CCDC6 are predominantly substrates of CDK1, while the
phosphothreonine residues are predominantly substrates of
GSK3 (Figure 2E and 2F).

by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with the specific antibodies, as shown. The immunoblots of the whole cell lysates (WCL) are shown at

Mutations of the phosphoresidues in the CCDC6
degron motifs for FBXW7 recognition sites affect
CCDC6 cell cycle regulated turnover

CDK1 enhanced the FBXW7-mediated ubiquitination of
the recombinant GST-CCDC6, in support of the primary
role exerted by this kinase (Supplementary figure 2).
Furthermore, we observed that transient silencing of
FBXW7 in HeLa cells was able to stabilize the CCDC6
protein in a dose dependent manner, in vivo (Figure 3C).
In CCDC6 protein sequence, the residues serine
359, serine 413 and threonine 427 have been recognized
as canonical FBXW7 degron motifs and conserved
across different species [15]. A CCDC6 mutant in the
mentioned residues showed an increased half life when
overexpressed in HeLa cells in presence of cycloheximide
(CHX), an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis (Figure
3D). Moreover, in experiment of co-immunoprecipitation
we have observed that the CCDC6 triple mutant is
impaired in its binding to FBXW7 (Figure 3E). Thus, the
data produced by us and by others [15] suggest that the

Proper phosphorylation of protein substrates
is required for FBXW7 recognition and targeting for
degradation [27]. Recently, CCDC6 has been recognised as
a novel FBXW7 E3 ubiquitin ligase (Ubl) substrate [15].
In order to determine if CCDC6 was modified by HAUbiquitin, we performed an immunoprecipitation assay
with myc-CCDC6 construct and we detected CCDC6
modifications, reminiscent of ubiquitinylation (Figure
3A). We next determined that recombinant CCDC6 is
directly ubiquitylated by the reconstituted FBXW7containing Skip1-Cullin-Fbox (SCF) complex, by an in
vitro assay (Figure 3B). Interestingly, the incubation with

Figure 3: FBXW7 increases CCDC6 turnover via increasing CCDC6 ubiquitination. A) 293T cells were transfected with
the indicated plasmids. The amount of ubiquitinated CCDC6 was analysed by immunoprecipitation (IP) of myc-CCDC6 followed by
immunoblotting (IB) with anti-HA. B) Affinity-purified GST-CCDC6 recombinant protein (Abnova H00008030-P01) was incubated with
purified E1, E2, His-ubiquitin and 293T cell lysate as source of E3 ligase FBXW7, from cells transiently transfected with HA-FBXW7, at
37°C for 60 min (according to manufacturer instructions; see M&M). The ubiquitination reaction products were resolved by SDS-PAGE
and probed with anti-Histidine antibody and anti-CCDC6 antibody. C) Sh-FBXW7 constructs, at 2, 3 or 4 μg doses, were transiently
transfected in 293T cells. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Expression levels of cyclin E are shown as a
representative substrate of FBXW7. D) CCDC6 turnover rate is reduced in HeLa cells overexpressing the mutated triple mutant CCDC6
construct (SST359/413/427AAA) (TM), compared to the CCDC6 wild type, (WT), construct overexpressing cells. Cells were treated
with cycloheximide (CHX) (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. E) MycCCDC6 WT and TM constructs were cotransfected with HA-FBXW7 into 293T cells in presence of MG132 (25 μM). Cell lysates were
immunoprecipitated with anti-myc and immunoblotted with the anti-HA antibody. Whole cell lysates, shown at the bottom of the figure,
have been immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.

cancer cells [28]. First, we observed that the regulation
of CCDC6 stability was found to be proteasomedependent in HCT116 wt cells, as MG132 treatment
leads to stabilization of endogenous CCDC6 (Figure 5A).
Moreover, we report that the HCT116 FBXW7-/- have
increased levels of endogenous CCDC6 at western blot
when compared with HCT116 wild type cells (Figure
5B). The impairment of the FBXW7 activity in HCT116
FBXW7-/- is confirmed by the cyclin E stabilization at
western blot, that is not detected in wild type HCT116
cells [29]. Nevertheless, the CCDC6 mRNA levels
were substantially constant in these cells (Figure 5C).
In experiments performed with the cycloheximide
we observed a delayed CCDC6 turnover (nearly 60
minutes) in the HCT116 FBXW7-/- cells compared to
the HCT116 wt cells (Figure 5D). To further analyse the
role of FBXW7 in the regulation of the CCDC6 turnover
in mitosis, the HCT116 cells (wt and FBXW7-/-) were
synchronized and the protein extracts collected throughout
the mitotic time course. During mitotic arrest, CCDC6
degradation was attenuated in HCT116 FBXW7-/- cells,
compared to the wild type cells (Figure 5E), indicating
that the fluctuations of endogenous levels of CCDC6
protein are mostly dependent on the FBXW7 activity in
mitosis. Interestingly, in HCT116 FBXW7-/- the stabilized
CCDC6 protein appeared mainly localized in the cytosol
(Figure 5F), a condition that has been related to tumor
growth [30, 31].

phosphorylation of the CCDC6 residues, that are targets
of GSK3, allows FBXW7 to act as a negative regulator
of CCDC6 stability. In order to define if the degradation
of CCDC6 in mitosis is dependent on FBXW7 binding
upon phosphorylation of the GSK3 target residues
(S359, S413, T427), we expressed in HeLa cells the
single, S359A, double, ST359/427AA (DM), and triple,
SST359/413/427AAA (TM) mutants of CCDC6 that
showed a defect in the mitotic shifts after 16 hours of
treatment with nocodazole (time 0 from nocodazole
release) with a progressive reduction that appeared related
to the number of the modified residues, with a striking
protein stabilization observed in the triple mutant (Figure
4A). Moreover, the overexpression of myc-CCDC6
constructs, mutated in all the phosphodegron recognition
sites (triple mutant, TM), did not show the cyclic variation
observed for the myc-CCDC6 wt protein during the
mitotic time course (Figure 4B). Therefore, mutations in
the CCDC6 phosphoresidues, recognized by GSK3, are
responsible of the impaired turnover of CCDC6 during the
progression of the cell cycle.

and H460, CCDC6 transcripts did not show significant
variability, while quite different CCDC6 protein levels
were observed [14]. Moreover, by cycloheximide
experiments differences of the CCDC6 half life were
detected in the NSCLC cells (Supplementary Figure 3).
Thus, in the lung cellular system, the H1975 and the
H1299 cells, characterized by high levels of USP7 protein,
show more CCDC6 product compared to the H460 and the

endogenous CCDC6 interacts specifically with USP7
(Figure 6A). The myc-tagged CCDC6 truncated mutant
(1-223) still coimmunoprecipitated with USP7, suggesting
that the aminoterminus of CCDC6 is sufficient for the

unveiled that in NSCLC cell lines, H1975, H1299, A549

the levels of CCDC6 protein in different cell types. The
overexpression of FLAG-HA-USP7 in HeLa and in H460
cells increased the amount of CCDC6 protein (Figure 6D).
The knockdown of USP7 in HCT116 cells [32] decreased
CCDC6 protein (Figure 5B), without affecting the CCDC6
mRNA, as shown in the Figure 5C. The knockdown of
USP7 in HCT116 altered the CCDC6 half life, affecting
its stability (Figure 5D). In order to determine the effects
of the de-ubiquitinase USP7 on the CCDC6 turnover, we
evaluated the amount of CCDC6 at different time point in
a mitotic time course performed in HCT116 cells that were
deficient for USP7. In these cells, the impairment of the
CCDC6 stability is mostly evident at 6 and 9 hours from
nocodazole release (Figure 5E). In general, we observed
reduction of CCDC6 protein after USP7 knockdown,
consistently with the fact that ubiquitin is not removed
any longer from CCDC6. In an in vitro ubiquitination
assay we observed that the ubiquitination mediated by
FBXW7 complex on the recombinant CCDC6, as shown
in the figure 3B, is impaired by the presence of USP7
(Supplementary Figure 4). We also observed that alanine
substitutions of the mentioned S/T residues enhanced the
interaction of CCDC6 with USP7 (Figure 6E). Thus, we
hypothesized that CCDC6 phosphorylation at the residues
that are targets of CDK1 and GSK3 may limit the CCDC6USP7 interaction. Interestingly, the immunostaining of 62
primary NSCLC showed that expression levels of USP7
directly correlated to CCDC6 protein levels (Figure 6F).
The correlation of CCDC6 and USP7 positivity staining
intensity was proved to be statistical significant (χ2 test: p

Recently, we have reported that the H460 NSCL
cancer cells, that show low levels of CCDC6 protein,
are sensitive to the PARP inhibitor olaparib, whereas
H1975 cells, harboring high levels of CCDC6 protein, are
resistant to olaparib and become sensitive when CCDC6
is knocked down [14]. Here we show that the knockdown
of USP7 reduces the levels of CCDC6 in HCT116 cells
(Figure 5B) and increases their sensitivity to olaparib
(Figure 6G and 6H). Moreover, the combination of
cisplatinum and olaparib has a synergistic effect on these
cells. In HCT116 USP7-/- and in HCT116 CCDC6-/-,
that we have generated (Supplementary Figure 5A), the
reconstitution of CCDC6 is sufficient to revert the olaparib
sensitivity, suggesting that CCDC6 levels are the critical
determinant for the olaparib sensitivity (Figure 6G and
6H; Supplementary Figure 5B). Therefore, we suggest
that the clinical usage of USP7 inhibitors [33, 34], by
downregulating the CCDC6 levels, might increase the
sensitization to olaparib and enhance the response to
standard chemotherapeutics in combined therapy in cancer
cells.

is a cell cycle regulated protein in mammalian cells.
CCDC6 levels increase at boundary G1/S, pick at G2
and decrease in mitosis; the same evidences observed in
Xenopus laevis extracts support the notion that CCDC6
behaviour is highly conserved (Supplementary Figure
6). The CCDC6 modifications detected in cell cycle are
mostly dependent on phosphorylation events generated by
multiple cell cycle dependent kinases that prime CCDC6
for degradation in mitosis in a proteasome dependent
manner.
As the control of CCDC6 stability involves
both ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation processes we
have characterized FBXW7 as the E3 Ubiquitin ligase
responsible for the CCDC6 degradation and USP7 as the
de-ubiquitynating enzyme that counteracts the FBXW7
activity for CCDC6 stabilization. The stability of CCDC6
in G2, also observed in previous work, has pointed out
to the role of CCDC6 in the G2/M checkpoint [9]. Here,
we report a critical role of FBXW7 in the control of
CCDC6 homeostasis in mitosis by regulating its ubiquitinproteasomal degradation and providing evidences that the
CCDC6 post-translational regulation in the cell cycle may
account for differences in cancer cells drug response.
Recent findings unveiled that CCDC6 different
levels in NSCLC are probably due to variations in protein
stability and/or turnover, since CCDC6 transcript did
not show significant variability in NSCLC cell lines and
NSCL FFPE primary samples [14].
Thus, we hypothesized that the alteration of CCDC6
steady-state, controlled by FBXW7 or USP7, may help to
select tumors that carry FBXW7 loss/mutation or USP7
mutations, as potentially responsive to olaparib treatment.
Our study shows that the FBXW7 and USP7 enzymes
keep CCDC6 protein in check of G2/M phase during the
cell cycle. In tumors overexpressing USP7, or carrying
an impaired FBXW7-mediated degradation, CCDC6
is highly stabilized. Conversely, tumors harbouring
barely detectable levels of USP7 have reduced amount
of CCDC6 protein. We recently reported that defective
CCDC6 drives a PARP inhibitors sensitivity in NSCLC.
Thus, the identification of NSCL tumors that are deficient
in USP7 may provide insight into the selection of patients
that could benefit of the PARP inhibitors in combination
to the conventional chemotherapy. Thus, we wonder if the
use of USP7 inhibitors, by reducing CCDC6 stability, may
increase the PARP inhibitors sensitivity and improve the
management of NSCLC patients.
FBXW7 is considered an haploinsufficient tumor
suppressor that targets several proto-oncoproteins for
degradation, including cyclin E, Myc, c-jun, Mcl1
[27, 35-43]. Here, we enroll CCDC6, a protein of the
DNA Damage response, as a novel FBXW7 substrate,
suggesting that patients carrying FBXW7 mutations might
present a more stable CCDC6 protein being more resistant
to olaparib combination for their treatment. However, our
data show that cells null for FBXW7 mainly maintain a

cytosolic localization of CCDC6. As we have previously
reported, SUMO2 post-translational modifications of
CCDC6, occurring when ubiquitynation is impaired,
mainly localize CCDC6 in the cytosol limiting the CCDC6
nuclear activity [30-31]. In our system we have identified
a correlation between the genetic status of FBXW7 and
the sensitivity to cisplatinum, as the FBXW7 null cells,
in which CCDC6 is more stable, are highly responsive
to platinum salts. Furthermore, our observations suggest
that CDK1 possibly primes CCDC6 in order to favour
GSK3 phosphorylation in the degron motifs and promotes
its binding to FBXW7 in a cellular context. As well the
phosphorylation events might also affect the USP7 binding
in mitosis, since the CCDC6-USP7 interaction appears to
be stronger during the cellular interphase, when CCDC6
is more stable (Supplementary Figure 7). Our model
suggest that USP7 might act by removing the ubiquitin
from CCDC6 protein in cells exposed to DNA damage
in order to protect CCDC6 from FBXW7-mediated
degradation. In our study we show that about 20% of
NSCLC exhibit reduced USP7 expression and also have
barely detectable levels of CCDC6. The loss of CCDC6
can cause the impairment of HR DNA repair providing the
indications for the PARP inhibitors treatment in NSCLC or
in tumors that harbour low levels of CCDC6 or of USP7.
We wonder if the use of specific USP7 inhibitors would
enhance CCDC6 turnover in order to sensitize cancer
cells to the PARP inhibitors in combination with standard
chemotherapies. Moreover, it has been reported that
USP7 reduction is related to chemo- and radio- therapy
resistance in lung adenocarcinomas [44]. Therefore,
the identification of CCDC6 as a novel USP7 substrate
provides the rationale for novel personalized therapy in
NSCLC patients carrying USP7 deficiency.

was
determined
by a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2-5diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, CellTiter 96 AQueous
One Solution assay (Promega), as 50% inhibitory
concentration (IC50) values. Briefly, cells were plated in
quintuplicate in 96-well plates at a density of 1.000-3.000
cells per well, and continuously exposed to each drug for
144h. Each assay was performed in quintuplicate and IC50
values were expressed as mean +/- standard deviation. The
results of the combined treatment were analyzed according
to the method of Chou and Talaly by using the CalcuSyn
software program [46]. The resulting combination index
(CI) is a quantitative measure of the degree of interaction
between different drugs. A CI value of unity denotes
additive activity while CI > 1 denotes antagonism, and CI
< 1 denotes synergy between agents.

Plasmids and transfection
CCDC6 shRNA (pLKO.1 puro) was from SigmaAldrich. For production of stable lines, HCT116 cells were
transfected with a plasmid pool (shCCDC6, NM_005436)
or a pool of nontargeting vectors (sh control) by the
Nucleofection. PcDNA4ToA-CCDC6 plasmids were
transfected with FuGene HD (Promega) and have been
described elsewhere [7]. From myc- (pcDNA4ToAmychis-CCDC6) template several myc-CCDC6 mutants at
serine or threonine putative phosphorylation sites were
created using the Quick Change Site Directed Mutagenesis
Kit (Agilent, CA). To obtain the double and the triple
mutant we used sequentially the single and double mutants
as template with the other primers. The oligo sequences
are reported in the Supplementary Table 1. Sh-FBXW7

areas of each ‘donor’ tissue block and brought into one
recipient paraffin block (3×2.5 cm) using a semiautomated
tissue arrayer (Galileo TMA, Milan, Italy).

IHC analysis

Real time PCR

For light microscopy, tissues (25 whole sections
and TMA) were fixed by immersion in 10% formalin
and embedded in paraffin by standard procedures; 4
μm sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) or processed for immunohistochemistry with
anti-CCDC6 antibody, HPA-019051 (Sigma-Aldrich, Co.
LLC), and anti-USP7 antibody, HPA-015641 (SigmaAldrich, Co. LLC). The immunohistochemical staining
of USP7 and CCDC6 was evaluated semiquantitatively
as the percentage of positive cells (with either nuclear
or cytoplasmic localization). Cells were classified as low
staining, [e.g. 0 (<5%) and + (5-25%)] and high staining
[++ (26-50%) and +++ (>50%)].

PCR reactions were performed on RNA isolated
from different cell lines using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen)
and reverse-transcribed using MuLV RT (Invitrogen). qRTPCR was performed with Syber Green (Agilent) using
already reported CCDC6 primers [47]. To calculate the
relative expression levels we used the 2−ΔΔCT method.

Immunofluorescence staining
Asynchronous cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and treated with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS)/0.25% Triton X-100. After staining with
primary antibody, cells were washed in PBS and incubated
for 30 min at room temperature with secondary antibody.
Nuclei were visualized by staining with DAPI. Images
were collected using a laser scanning confocal microscope
(LSM 510; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) equipped with
a plan Apo 63× NA 1.4 oil immersion objective lens. As
previously described [48], the quantiﬁcation of mean
ﬂuorescence intensities in selected regions of interest were
performed using LSM 510 software. All z planes were
volume rendered by LSM 510 software.

Reagents and antibodies
Anti Cyclin E (sc-247), anti Cyclin B (sc-594), anti
Cyclin A (sc-751), anti Aurora A (sc-25425), anti Plk1 (sc5585) and anti-Gsk3α/β (sc7291) were form Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (CA, USA); anti-CCDC6 (ab56353) was
from Abcam; anti-USP7 (A300-033A) was from Bethyl;
anti-MPM2 (05-368) was from Millipore; anti-phosphoSerine (# 37430) was from Qiagen; anti-phosphoThreonine (# 9386) was from Cell Signaling Technology;
anti-poly-Histidine (H1029) was from SIGMA-Aldrich,
Inc. Secondary antibodies were from Biorad, California.

Tumors
Archival tumor samples from 62 patients (males
and females, smokers and nonsmokers) with NSCL
cancer were retrieved from the files of the Pathology
Sections of the “Ospedale Cardarelli” of Naples (N=37)
and from the files of the Marshall University, Virginia,
USA (N=25), with informed consent and standard IRB
approvals. Clinico-pathologic data were recorded. The
patient age ranged between 35 and 80 years, with a
mean of 63.5 years. Patients underwent surgery between
2005 and 2010. After surgical resection, tissues were
fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in
paraffin blocks. Sections (4 μm thick) were stained with
H&E. Histologic grading and pathological staging were
performed according to WHO guidelines [49].

Ubiquitination assay
The in vitro ubiquitylation assays were performed
with Ubiquitinylation kit (Enzo Life Sciences). Affinitypurified GST-CCDC6 recombinant protein (Abnova
H00008030-P01) was incubated with His-ubiquitin,
purified E1, E2, ATP and the 293T cell lysate as source
of E3 ligase FBXW7 (upon HA-FBXW7 or empty
vector plasmids transient transfections). The cells were
treated with MG132 (25µM) for eight hours before lysis.
According to manufacturer instructions the reaction was
performed at 37°C for 60 min and it was stopped by
adding of 2X SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The reaction
products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with
indicated antibodies.
