ABSTRACT
Multidrug resistance MDR proteins (MRPs) are members of the C family of a group
of proteins named ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters. MRPs can transport drugs
including anticancer drugs, nucleoside analogs, antimetabolites and tyrosine kinase
inhibitors. Drugs used in HCC therapy, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib, are
substrates of uptake and/or efflux transporters. Variable expression of MRPs at the
plasma membrane of tumor cells may contribute to drug resistance and subsequent
clinical response. Recently, we reported that the hepatocyte SLAMF3 expression
(Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family member 3) was reduced in tumor
cells from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to its high expression in adjacent
tissues. In the present study, we make a strong correlation between induced SLAMF3
overexpression and the specific loss of MRP-1 expression and its functionalities as a
drugs resistance transporter. No changes were observed on expression of ABCG2 and
MDR. More importantly, we highlight a strong inverse correlation between MRP-1 and
SLAMF3 expression in patients with HCC. We propose that the SLAMF3 overexpression
in cancerous cells could represent a potential therapeutic strategy to improve the drugs
sensibility of resistant cells and thus control the therapeutic failure in HCC patients.

as Sorafenib, which inhibits tyrosine kinases [2]. The
main cause of HCC is chronic cirrhosis, which is often
associated with an infection with hepatitis B virus or
hepatitis C virus. Alcohol consumption or other liver
metabolic diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver or
hepatitis exposure to aflatoxins are also considered
as etiological factors. Regardless of the etiology,
only patients with HCC at an early stage can benefit

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading
cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Highest incidence is
observed in East Asia and sub-Saharan region, despite
the recent improvement in early detection by imaging
techniques [1]. HCC has recently been treated by a
new therapeutic approach using small molecules such

from therapies such as radical surgical resection, liver
transplantation, or the local percutaneous ablation.
Therapy based on anti-multikinases such as, Sorafenib, is
indicated only in HCC patients with residual liver function
and preserved physical condition [3, 4]. Unfortunately,
during the course of treatment, cancer cells develop
resistance towards functionally and structurally different
anticancer drugs by either acquired (due to host factors) or
intrinsic (due to genetic or epigenetic) mechanisms [5, 6].
Use of Sorafenib as a reference treatment improves only
slightly overall survival in patients estimated at 3 months.
Limited therapeutic effect of Sorafenib could be due to the
resistance of cancerous cells to drugs and to the adverse
reactions of this molecule. Resistance to drug therapy
remains a major challenge in HCC treatment despite
successful advances using targeted therapies [3, 5]. Indeed,
the effectiveness of chemotherapy for HCC is affected by
the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype [5]. One of the
mechanisms of resistance to molecules of chemotherapy is
due to decreased absorption of these molecules and their
increased efflux via membrane transporters proteins [7].
Several types of transporters are physiologically
expressed in different cell types such as human
hepatocytes, which take up endogenous substances
and drugs across the sinusoidal membrane and release
them in the bile [8, 9]. Several articles have reported
the implication of organic cation transporter (OCT) 1
(encoded by the SLC22A1 gene), OCT3 (SLC22A3) as
well as the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters
MDR1/P-glycoprotein (ABCB1), multidrug resistance
protein (MRP, ABCC2), and breast cancer resistance
protein (BCRP, ABCG2) in resistance to drugs which are
commonly used in the HCC treatment. These transporters
also confer resistance to anthracyclines, platinum drugs
and sorafenib [7, 9-11]. Several studies have examined
the expression of BCRP, MDR1, ABC drug efflux and
OCT drug uptake transporter in the acquisition of drug
resistance in HCC [7, 12-15]. MRP-1 expression in HCC
was found to be associated with more aggressive tumor
phenotype [14, 16]. Recently, Huang et al. reported that
co-treatment with a BCRP/ABCG2 inhibitor greatly
increased the cytotoxicity of sorafenib in HCC cells [17].
Taken together, decreased expression of efflux transporters
would favor the accumulation of cytostatic drugs within
the tumor cells and improve the drug efficiency. Thus
patient-specific expression of uptake and efflux drug
transporters may contribute to the optimization of the
selection of HCC drugs and/or adjustment of dosing.
SLAMF3 belongs to signaling lymphocytic
activation molecule family receptors (SLAMF-Rs)
that trigger both inhibitory and activation signals
in immune cells [18]. We have earlier reported the
expression of SLAMF3 in hepatocytes and made a link
between SLAMF3 high expression in HCC cells and
low proliferation index and cell cycle arrest at G2/M
[19]. SLAMF3 expression also inhibits ERK1/2, JNK
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and mTOR pathways and controls tumor progression
of HCC-xenografts in animal model [19]. In addition,
we have also reported that SLAMF3 controls cell cycle
progression in a RB/PLK-1 dependent manner [20]. The
identification of SLAMF3 and its potential role in HCC
cells proliferation control prompted us to investigate other
potential pathways involved in its anti-proliferative effect.
In the present study, we have evaluated the effect of
SLAMF3 expression on MDR expression levels in HCC
cells. Forced expression of SLAMF3 in HCC specifically
and significantly decreased the expression of MRP-1 in
HCC cells. Rhodamine 123 accumulation in SLAMF3
overexpressing cells and use of MRP-1 specific inhibitor
MK-571 identified the effect of SLAMF3 on MRP-1
expression and function. The MRP-1 function was inhibited
as proved by efflux MPR-1 testing activity using Rhodamine
123 accumulation test and by specific inhibition tests using
MK-571 as MRP-specific inhibitor. Taken together, inducing
over expression of SLAMF3 in cancerous hepatocytes could
improve its sensitivity to drugs and could be a potent adjuvant
to therapeutic strategy in HCC.

RESULTS
Cells from hepatocarcinoma express MDR
transporters and SLAMF3 inhibits specifically
MRP-1 expression
Several studies have examined the expression of
BCRP, MDR1, ABC drug efflux or OCT drug uptake
transporter in the acquisition of drug resistance in
HCC. Recently, Huang et al. reported that co-treatment
with a BCRP/ABCG2 inhibitor greatly increased
the cytotoxicity of Sorafenib in HCC cells [17]. We
checked the expression of major drugs transporters
implicated in the acquisition of drug resistance profile.
Then, transcripts from human HCC cell line Huh-7
cells (untreated cells WT, Mock plasmid transfected
and SLAMF3 overexpressing cells) were extracted
and MDR, ABCG2 and MRP-1 genes expression was
quantified by Q-PCR. We show that MDR, ABCG2
and MRP were highly expressed by Huh-7 cells (Figure
1a, 1b, 1c). We have earlier described the expression
of SLAMF3 receptor in hepatocytes and shown
that the high level expression of SLAMF3 inhibits
proliferation in HCC cells [19, 20]. In order to clarify
the link between the tumor suppressor effect of SLAMF3
and MDR expression in hepatocytes, we forced the
SLAMF3 expression in Huh-7 cells and then quantified
their expression. Interestingly among the three genes
tested, only MRP-1 is specifically and significantly
(p<0.01) decreased in hepatocytes when SLAMF3
was highly expressed and no effect was observed on
MDR and ABCG2 expression level (Figure 1a, 1b, 1c).
Observing the inhibition of MRP-1 mRNA expression,
prompted us to quantify the protein levels. Lysates of

cells transfected with mock and SLAMF3 plasmid
were analyzed by Western blot. Cells transfected with
SLAMF3 plasmid displayed significantly higher levels of
SLAMF3 protein than mock transfected cells. However,
in the cells transfected with the mock plasmid displayed
elevated levels of MRP-1 protein than the SLAMF3 over
expressing cells. (Figure 1d).

Expression of SLAMF3 is lost in tumor tissues as
well as in cells from HCC cell lines compared to healthy
tissues and cultured primary human hepatocytes PHH as
we have reported previously [19, 20]. Here, we analyzed
the expression of SLAMF3 and MRP-1 in cells from
several HCC cell lines namely Huh-7, HepG2, Hep3B,
SNU398, SNU449 and compared to PHH. We observed
a strong inverse correlation between the expression of
SLAMF3 and MRP-1 in PHH in which SLAMF3 is highly
expressed while MRP-1 has weakly detectable. Inversely,
in HCC cells, the expression of SLAMF3 is repressed with
an elevated expression of MRP-1 (Figure 3a). Similarly,
we also checked this correlation in pT/T primary tissue
samples from HCC patients. The expression of SLAMF3
in all samples was checked and confirmed our previously
reported results as SLAMF3 expression in T was reduced

MRP-1 is highly expressed in tumor tissues from
HCC patients
Based on our in vitro results, we then quantified
the MRP-1 in paired T (tumor) and pT (peri tumor)
samples from 15 HCC patients freshly resected at Amiens
University Hospital, France. Analysis of mRNA in samples
demonstrated that in all patients (100%), the MRP-1
expression was significantly (p<0.01) higher in tumor
tissues compared to pT (Figure 2a). The protein expression
analysis by Western blot confirmed the higher expression
of MRP-1 in T when compared to pT tissues (Figure 2b).

results confirm the significant (R=0.56, p = 0.0371)
inverse correlation between SLAMF3 and MRP-1
expression in all patients with HCC (100%) (Figure
3b, 3c, 3d). This result suggested that the acquisition of
resistance by cancerous cells correlates with progressive
loss of SLAMF3.

drugs transporter, we checked the effect of SLAMF3
expression on Rhodamine 123 (R123) accumulation in
Huh-7 cells (Mock and SLAMF3 overexpressing cells
SLAMF3+). Briefly, R123 accumulates passively in the
cell while its release from the cell is MDR-dependent
[22]. Cells transfected with mock and SLAMF3 plasmid
were incubated with R123 (1, 2 and 5 mM) for 15 minutes
after several washes, cells were incubated in a R123 free
medium for 2 hours at 37°C before cell recovery and
analysis of R123 fluorescence in SLAMF3+ and mock subpopulations. We show that R123 accumulation levels in
mock cells was significantly lower than that of SLAMF3+
(Figure 4a), suggesting that the MRP-1 downregulation
induced by SLAMF3 overexpression prevents the efflux
of the R123 that remains in the cancerous cells. eFluxxID® Gold multidrug resistance assay kit (ENZ-51030

Overexpression of SLAMF3 in HCC cells

We have shown an inverse correlation between
the SLAMF3 and MRP-1 expression in the liver tissue.
The expression of MRP-1 in hepatic tissue confers
to tumor a resistant profile to drugs whose discharge
from the target cell is made by MRP-1. In addition, we
highlight that SLAMF3 overexpression in the cancer cell
induced, specifically, the downregulation of the MRP-1
expression. To clarify the effect on MRP-1 function, as

(p-glycoprotein), MRP-1 and BCRP. Briefly, the assay uses
a hydrophobic, non-fluorescent compound that readily
penetrates the cell membrane, where it is hydrolyzed to
a hydrophilic fluorescent dye by intracellular esterases.
Unless the eFluxx-ID® dye is pumped out of the cell, the
esterase cleaved dye remains trapped inside the cell. Thus,
cells exhibiting drug resistance will exhibit a diminished
fluorescence. The fluorescence signal of the dye generated
within the cells thus depends upon the activity of the ABC
transporters. The cells with highly active transporters
exhibit lower fluorescence because of the active efflux
of the probe from the cell. Application of specific
inhibitors of the various ABC transporter proteins allows
differentiation between the three common types of pumps.
In our test, cells (mock and SLAMF3+) were incubated
with Gold detection reagent with and without MRP-1
specific inhibitor (MK-571) according to the kit protocol
for 30 minutes at 37°C and suspended in cold PBS for
analysis by flow cytometry. The formula to calculate

multidrug resistance activity factor (MAF) is described
in the instruction manual of the MDR assay kit and also
described previously [23]. We observed a low fluorescence
in Mock cells while a significant shift was observed when
cells overexpressed SLAMF3 (Figure 4b). The calculated
multidrug resistance activity factor (MAF) indicated the
significant (p<0.01) decreased MDR activity in SLAMF3
overexpressing cells. In the presence of MK-571, the
accumulating fluorescence signal of the dye generated
within the cells was similar in SLAMF3 overexpressing
cells as well as in Mock indicating the MRP-1 inhibition
specifically (Figure 4d, 4c).

DISCUSSION
The MDR of tumors is one of the major obstacles
leading to the failure of chemotherapy, refers to the fact that
the cells can resist a variety of chemicals [5]. Understanding
the MDR protein regulators in HCC is crucial to improve

the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Physiologically, MRP-1
mediates the active efflux of a broad range of glucuronide,
glutathione, and sulfate conjugates [24]. Based on its broad
substrate range and ubiquitous tissue distribution, MRP1 is now believed to be involved in many physiological
and pathophysiological processes, including inflammatory
responses and oxidative stress defense [25]. Physiological
substrate of MRP-1 also includes cobalamin (vitamin B12),
which was confirmed by vesicular transport experimentation
and gene silencing studies [26]. In cancerous cells, MRP1 can mediate resistance to a wide variety of anticancer
drugs, including doxorubicin, methotrexate (MTX),
vincristine, and etoposide and its expression level often
indicates cancer aggressiveness [27-29]. Akimitsu et al.

showed that aggressive breast carcinoma subtypes, display
an overexpression of MRP-1 [30]. MRP-1 is highly
expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) than
in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines. Furthermore,
overexpression of MRP-1 and MRP-3 is responsible for
decreased drug sensitivity towards vincristine, etoposide,
doxorubicin, and cisplatin in lung cancer patients [31]. The
involvement of MRP-1 was also highlighted in colorectal
carcinoma and level of MRP-1 was also found to be higher
in patients with colorectal, prostate, pancreas and renal
cancers as compared to the control group [32–35]. In the
same sense, the expression of MRP-1 (mRNA and protein)
was also associated with more aggressive tumor phenotype
in hepatocarcinoma HCC [16]. In addition, clear correlation

independent experiments (n = 3; * p< 0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.005). The MRP-1 activity was specifically measured by using eFluxxID® Gold multidrug resistance assay kit (NZ-51030). Unless the eFluxx-ID® dye is pumped out of the cell, the esterase cleaved dye is
trapped inside the cell. Cells exhibiting drug resistance will have diminished fluorescence. Cells (mock and SLAMF3+) were incubated
with Gold detection reagent with and without specific inhibitor of MRP-1 (MK-571) for 30 min in 37°C and suspended in cold PBS for

was also reported between higher MRP-1 expression levels
and the poorly differentiated tumors as well as in large
tumors showing microvascular invasion [36].
Recently, we identified the expression of SLAMF3
in hepatocytes and its implication in controlling
proliferation of cancerous cell. We also highlighted
certain potential mechanisms responsible for the tumor
suppressor effect of SLAMF3 by inhibiting the MAPK/
ERK1/2 phosphorylation and blocking the cell cycle
at G2/M in an RB/PLK-1 dependent-manner [19, 20].
Herein, we show that establishing the high expression
of SLAMF3 in cancerous cells inhibits specifically the
expression of MRP-1. In addition, we checked the cell
sensitivity to Sorafenib in the presence of high and low
expression of SLAMF3. Our results show that the IC50
of Sorafenib is respectively 4 and 5.4 μM in the presence
and absence of SLAMF3 (data not shown). Our results
suggest that Sorafenib is more efficient in the presence
of a high expression of SLAMF3 through at least the
inhibition of the expression and function of MRP-1.
Our results were confirmed by the inverse correlation
observed between the decreased SLAMF3 expression
and increased MRP-1 expression in HCC patients. It
has been reported that MRP-1 mRNA levels were higher
in subclass A HCCs, which have a worse survival [36].
Taken together, our results suggest that the loss of
SLAMF3 expression by cancerous cells may be one of
the mechanisms by which transformed cells overexpress
MDR, which result in drug resistance so that the cancer
can escape chemotherapy.
On one hand, SLAMF3 inhibited MAPK/ ERK
factors as we previously reported [19]. In our present
work, we demonstrate the link between SLAMF3
expression and resistance to drugs. El Azreq et al.
reported that MRP-1 expression was up-regulated in
an MAPK/ ERK – dependent manner when β1-intergin
signaling was triggered by collagen [37]. Our results
suggest that one mechanism by which SLAMF3 may
inhibit MRP-1 expression may implicate the inhibition
of MAPK-ERK pathway. On the other hand, SLAMF3
induced the cell cycle blockade at S-G2/M stage by
PLK-1 inhibition. We previously evidenced that RB
as cell cycle suppressor, is involved in the SLAMF3–
induced cell cycle arrest [20]. Elevated MRP-1
expression probably results in a growth advantage to
cancerous cells by pumping toxic substances out of
the tumor cells and protecting cells against oxidative
stress-related damage. Combining chemotherapy
with a MRP-1 inhibitor could improve the response
of HCC to chemotherapy in cases with elevated
MRP-1 expression. Here in, we show that SLAMF3
overexpression specifically reduced the MRP-1 function
to pump drugs outside of cells. Therefore, developing
inhibitors to block drug efflux function of MRPs could
be a viable strategy especially for the patients selected
with higher expression of MRPs.

Finally, our results suggest a potent role of SLAMF3
to increase sensitization of cancerous cells to drugs by
inhibiting MDR protein MRP-1. The forced expression of
SLAMF3 could be one of the potent therapeutic strategies
to control tumor progression by controlling proliferation,
induction of apoptosis and improving efficiency of drugs.
The pathophysiological mechanisms that induce repression
of SLAMF3 in tumorous cells still remain unknown and
additional studies are needed to identify the molecular
partners of hepatocyte SLAMF3 to elucidate mechanisms
implicated in the tumor-suppressing functions.

Western blot analysis
Cells (106 per assay) and primary tissues
were lysed in Nonidet P40 (NP40) buffer (1%
NP40, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 150 mM
NaCL, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM Na3VO6, 0.5 mM
phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 mg/ml
aprotinin, 5 mg/ml leupeptin and 2 mg/ml pepstatin)
containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors
(Roche). Equal amounts of each protein sample
were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE,
blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad,
Munich, Germany) and blotted with antibodies against
SLAMF3, MRP-1 and actin. Blots were developed
with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Rhodamine 123 (R123, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Heidelberg, Germany) is a fluorescent dye that enters
passively into cell reaching the mitochondria and its efflux
is dependent on a wide variety of MDR [21]. Multidrug
resistant cells demonstrate reduced accumulation of
Rhodamine 123. Briefly, SLAMF3 transfected cells (at 24
hour post-transfection, 2x105 cells/ assay) were incubated
with R123 (1, 2 and 5 mM) compared to R123-untreated
cells for 15 minutes at 37°C. After several washes in PBS
to remove excess R123, cultured cells were replaced at
37°C for additional 2 hours. Then, cells were harvested
in cold PBS/0.01% sodium azide/0.5% BSA, washed
and incubated with fluorescent-conjugated antibody antiSLAMF3 (clone HLy9.1.25, AbDSerotec, Colmar, France)
for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were analyzed by FACSAria and
FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences, Le Pont de Claix,
France). Results were presented as R123 positive cells in
SLAMF3- and SLAMF3+ gated cells. R123 signal detected
at 30 minutes in cells from cancerous lung cell line A549
was used as positive control.

Direct dye efflux assay for multidrug resistance
For specific inhibition of MDR, we used eFluxxID® Gold multidrug resistance assay kit (NZ-51030)
for simultaneous monitoring and functional detection
of three relevant ABC transporter proteins: MDR1
(p-glycoprotein), MRP-1 and BCRP (ENZ-51030-K100,
Enzo Life Sciences (ELS) AG Lausen, Switzerland).
Briefly, 2x105 cells (WT, mock and SLAMF3+) were
incubated with Gold detection reagent with and without
specific inhibitors of MDR1 (Verapamil), MRP-1 (MK571) and BCRP (Noviobiocin) according to the protocol
for 30 min in 37°C. Cells were suspended in cold PBS
for flow cytometry analysis. The formula to calculate
multidrug resistance activity factor (MAF) is described
in the instruction manual of the MDR assay kit which is:
MAFMRP= 100 x (FMRP-F0)/FMRP where FMRP corresponds
to the fluorescence intensity in the presence of verapamil
and F0 to the fluorescence intensity in the absence of
inhibitor.

Statistical analysis
Independent Student’s t-test was used to compare
MRP-1 mRNA expression in T and pT samples. The
Mann-Whitney U test was used for correlations between
(Spearman) between MRP-1/SLAMF3 mRNA expression.
Unless otherwise stated, results are expressed as the mean
± SD. Statistical analyses (Mann-Whitney tests and an
analysis of variance) were performed with Prism software
(version 4.0, GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The
threshold for statistical significant was set to p <0.05 for
all analyses.
