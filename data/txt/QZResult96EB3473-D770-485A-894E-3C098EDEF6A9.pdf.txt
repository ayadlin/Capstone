Abstract
Histone modiﬁcation determines epigenetic patterns of gene expression with methylation of histone H3 at
lysine 4 (H3K4) often associated with active promoters. LSD1/KDM1 is a histone demethylase that suppresses
gene expression by converting dimethylated H3K4 to mono- and unmethylated H3K4. LSD1 is essential for
metazoan development, but its pathophysiologic functions in cancer remain mainly uncharacterized. In this
study, we developed speciﬁc bioactive small inhibitors of LSD1 that enhance H3K4 methylation and derepress
epigenetically suppressed genes in vivo. Strikingly, these compounds inhibited the proliferation of pluripotent
cancer cells including teratocarcinoma, embryonic carcinoma, and seminoma or embryonic stem cells that
express the stem cell markers Oct4 and Sox2 while displaying minimum growth-inhibitory effects on nonpluripotent cancer or normal somatic cells. RNA interference–mediated knockdown of LSD1 expression
phenocopied these effects, conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of small molecules and further establishing the high degree
of sensitivity and selectivity of pluripotent cancer cells to LSD1 ablation. In support of these results, we found that
LSD1 protein level is highly elevated in pluripotent cancer cells and in human testicular seminoma tissues that
express Oct4. Using these novel chemical inhibitors as probes, our ﬁndings establish LSD1 and histone H3K4
methylation as essential cancer-selective epigenetic targets in cancer cells that have pluripotent stem cell
properties. Cancer Res; 71(23); 7238–49. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Histone methylation is a major covalent modiﬁcation of
histones that epigenetically regulates cell-speciﬁc gene expression patterns (1, 2). While methylations of histone H3 at lysines
9 (H3K9) and 27 (H3K27) suppress gene expression, the
methylations of lysine 4 (K4) in histone H3 (H3K4) usually
associate with actively transcribed genes (1–3). Histone methylation is dynamically controlled by speciﬁc histone methyltransferases and demethylases (3). Speciﬁcally, the methylaAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1School of Chemical Biology and Biotechnology,

tions at H3K4 are primarily catalyzed by histone methyltransferase complexes composed of the members of MLL (mixed
lineage leukemia) SET-domain methyltransferases, ASH2,
WDR5, and RBBP5 (2, 4). The methyl groups in H3K4 are
removed by histone demethylases LSD1 (also called KDM1,
AOF2, or BHC110), LSD2, and JARID1A-1D (1, 3, 5, 6).
Lysine-speciﬁc demethylase 1 (LSD1) belongs to the ﬂavin
adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent amine oxidase family
and speciﬁcally catalyzes the demethylation of di- and monomethylated H3K4 through amine oxidation (1, 5, 7). In contrast
to the JARID1 family of Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing
demethylases that remove the methyl group from tri-, di-, and
monomethylated H3K4 (1), demethylation by LSD1 requires a
protonated nitrogen in the methylated histone, precluding it
from removing the methyl group from trimethylated H3K4
(1, 5, 8). LSD1 is highly conserved in high eukaryotes, and null
mutation of LSD1 genes in the mouse causes embryonic
lethality (9). However, its pathophysiologic function remains
unclear (9, 10). Because the catalytic domain of LSD1 shares
signiﬁcant similarity with other members of the amine oxidase
family, most investigation on LSD1 function involves the use of
nonselective amine oxidase inhibitors, originally developed
against 2 major isoforms of monoamine oxidases, MAO-A and
MAO-B, and act through the irreversible modiﬁcation of the
covalently bound FAD at high concentrations (millimoles;
refs. 5, 8, 11–15). However, these monoamine oxidase inhibitors
induce substantial toxicity in vivo, causing difﬁculty and
confusion for interpretation of LSD1 in vivo function.

Novel LSD1 Demethylase Inhibitors Target Pluripotent Cancer Cells

Cancer stem cells are considered as the origin of various
heterogeneous cancer populations due to their pluripotent
or multipotent stem cell property (16–19). Development of
therapeutic drugs that target cancer stem cells is an unmet
medical demand, as these cells appear to be more resistant
to conventional chemo- or radiotherapy. They also often act
as the source for metastasis or recurring drug-resistant
cancers after treatment (16, 19, 20). Teratoma and teratocarcinoma are pluripotent germ cell tumors caused by
abnormal development of embryonic stem (ES) cells (21–
23). Other pluripotent tumors include embryonic carcinomas, seminomas, choriocarcinomas, and tumors of yolk sac.
These tumor cells often display pluripotent stem cell properties, express stem cell markers Oct4 and Sox2, and are
capable of differentiating into various tissue types (21–24). It
is well established that ES cells have distinct patterns of
histone methylations and other epigenetic modiﬁcations for
their maintenance and self-renewal (25). Reprogramming of
somatic cells into the induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by
expression of Oct4 and Sox2 is associated with dramatic
rearrangement of histone methylation (25, 26). However, it
remains unclear the exact role of various histone methylases
and demethylases in deﬁning the pluripotency of ES or
cancer stem cells.

Materials and Methods
Molecular modeling
The docking template structure of LSD1 was derived from
the crystal structure of LSD1 bound to the substrate-like
peptide (PDB code: 2v1d; ref. 27). Docking was done using the
latest version AutoDock 4.0 (28). The illustrated structures
were made by PyMOL (29).
Cell lines
F9, NCCIT, NTERA-2, HeLa, 293, NIH3T3, and mouse ES cells
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection within 6
months of the submission. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium with 10% FBS (30). F9 cells
were grown on Petri dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin, whereas
mouse ES cells were cultured on irradiated mouse embryonic
ﬁbroblasts (30, 31). All cells were authenticated in Nevada
Cancer Institute by speciﬁc markers such as Oct4, Sox2, p53,
and p16Ink4a and by their cell morphology and used within 3
months.
In vitro demethylation assays
Human LSD1 and mouse LSD2 were expressed in bacteria
and puriﬁed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins
(5, 30). Human LSD1 and JARID1A proteins were also obtained
from BPS Biosciences. The recombinant proteins were used for
demethylation assays using either the dimethylated H3K4
peptide or isolated histones from the nuclei of HeLa cells as
reported (refs. 5, 32, 33; see Supplementary Materials and
Methods). The conversion efﬁciency of the dimethylated (Me2)
H3K4 peptide to mono- (Me1) and nonmethylated (Me0) H3K4
is calculated using the integrated product peak areas in
MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–

Plus) and the following formula:
Area (Me0)  2 þ area (Me1)/[area (Me0) þ area (Me1) þ
area (Me2)]  2
The in vitro IC50 of each CBB compound for LSD1 inhibition
was calculated using the conversion efﬁciency and the GraphPad Prism5 software (5, 34).
Cell permeability assays
CBB1002, CBB1003, and CBB1007 were incubated with F9
cells for 2 hours. The extensively washed cells were lysed
immediately and the lysates were mixed with 4 volume of
acetone at 20 C for 6 hours. The precipitated proteins/
macromolecules were removed by centrifugation, and the
supernatant was lyophilized and dried pellets were dissolved
in methanol. The presence of CBB compounds was analyzed by
mass spectrometry using the pure compounds and the lysates
from untreated cells as m/z controls.

Results
Design and synthesis of novel LSD1 chemical inhibitors
To understand the function of LSD1, we developed novel
chemical compounds that speciﬁcally inhibit LSD1 demethylase. As a template for new LSD1 inhibitors, we used the protein
crystal structure of LSD1 and a substrate-like peptide inhibitor,
which was derived from the N-terminal 21-amino acid residues
of histone H3 peptide in which lysine 4 (K4) is replaced by
methionine (Fig. 1A, H3K4M) that binds to LSD1 with high
binding afﬁnity (Ki ¼ 0.05 mmol/L; refs. 14, 27, 35, 36). The
positively charged residues (Arg2 and Arg8) of the peptide
establish favorable electrostatic interactions with a cluster of
negatively charged residues on LSD1 surface that involve
Asp375, Glu379, Asp553, Asp555, Asp556, Asp557, and Glu559
(Fig. 1A). The funneled channel that accesses to FAD is blocked
by the peptide inhibitor. On the basis of the structural features
of LSD1 active site, especially the highly acidic properties of the
surface around the active site, we designed a nonpeptide
chemical scaffold that binds to LSD1 with a similar noncovalent binding mode to that of the peptide inhibitor (Fig. 1B). The
guanidinium groups of the small molecules, which mimic the
arginines, form strong hydrogen bonds with the negatively
charged residues of LSD1. A small compound library composed
of total 9 small molecules (CBB1001–CBB1009) based on the
original design (Fig. 1B– 1D) was synthesized (Fig. 1D).
The synthesis of the individual LSD1 inhibitor used conventional solution chemistry as shown in scheme 1 using CBB1001
as an example (Fig. 1C). Monomethyl isophthalate was converted into the corresponding bromide 3 (51% yield) by a 2-step
sequence including selective reduction of the acid group in 2
followed by treatment with N-bromosuccinimide and triphenylphosphane. A condensation of bromide 3 with 1-[N,N 0 -bis
(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amidino]piperazine 4 afforded the key
intermediate 5 which was hydrolyzed to produce intermediate
6. Intermediate 11 was initiated by treatment of methyl 4cyano-benzoate with lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, followed by protection with di-tert-butyldicarbonate to produce

substrate in vitro, yielding the intermediate monomethylated
and ﬁnal unmethylated H3K4 peptides (5), which can be
separated, resolved, and semiquantiﬁed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 2B). Analysis of CBB compounds at various dose–
response concentrations revealed that most of CBB compounds could effectively inhibit LSD1 activity, with CBB1002,
CBB1003, and CBB1007 displayed the best half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) at 11.16, 10.54, 5.27 mmol/
L, respectively (Fig. 2B, C, and H).
We also used methylated histones as LSD1 substrates to
analyze the effects of CBB compounds (5). As reported (5), LSD1
efﬁciently demethylated both mono- and dimethylated H3K4
in vitro but did not have detectable effects on trimethylated
H3K4 and dimethylated H3K9 (Fig. 2D and E). At 10 mmol/L, all
CBB compounds except CBB1001 and CBB1009 signiﬁcantly
blocked the demethylase activity of LSD1 on mono- and
dimethylated H3K4 but not trimethylated H3K4 or di-methylated H3K9 (Fig. 2D and E). Analysis of inhibitory concentrations
of representative CBB1002, CBB1003, and CBB1007 suggests
that their IC50 values are similar to the assays by mass spectrometry, with IC50 value of CBB1002 and CBB1003 about 5 to
10 mmol/L, and CBB1007 about 1 to 5 mmol/L (Fig. 2E).
We also examined the effects of CBB compounds on other
histone demethylases, such as LSD2 and JARID1A. LSD2 is a

7242

Cancer Res; 71(23) December 1, 2011

paralogue of LSD1 which shares 38% of identical amino acid
residues and 56% of amino acid similarity with LSD1 protein
in the conserved catalytic carboxy domain (6, 32). It can
demethylate both mono- and dimethylated H3K4. JARID1A
is a Jumonji domain-containing histone demethylase that
speciﬁcally removes tri-, di-, and monomethylated H3K4
(1, 33). Mass spectrometry–based demethylation assays
revealed that CBB compounds did not inhibit LSD2 and
JARID1A demethylase activities (Fig. 2F and G), suggesting
that CBB compounds speciﬁcally inhibit LSD1 but not other
demethylases.
LSD1 compounds are active in cancer cells to inhibit
LSD1 demethylation activity
LSD1 is a demethylase for mono- and dimethylated H3K4
and loss of LSD1 in vivo causes the accumulation of these
methylated forms of H3K4 (5, 11, 15). To determine the in vivo
effects of new LSD1 inhibitors, we treated mouse F9 embryonic
teratocarcinoma cells with CBB compounds and then monitored the accumulation of methylated H3K4 (Fig. 3A). Notably,
while CBB1001, CBB1002, CBB1005, and CBB1009 did not have
signiﬁcant effects at 10 mmol/L, CBB1003, CBB1004, and
CBB1006 to CBB1008 caused a reproducible increase of monoand dimethylated H3K4 after treatment (Fig. 3A) but had very

little effects on trimethylated H3K4 and dimethylated H3K9,
suggesting that they are speciﬁc for LSD1 but not other histone
demethylases. Analysis of the effects of 2 representative compounds CBB1003 and CBB1007 at various concentrations in F9
cells indicated that the IC50 values of CBB1003 and CBB1007
are about 5 to 10 and 1 to 5 mmol/L, respectively (Fig. 3B).
Loss of LSD1 can cause the activation of epigenetically
suppressed genes, such as CHRM4/M4-ArchR and SCN3A, in
cultured cells (5), as a consequence of increased levels of H3K4
methylation. To investigate whether CBB compounds can
inhibit LSD1 and consequently induce epigenetically suppressed gene expression, we monitored the activation of
CHRM4 and SCN3A genes by quantitative reverse transcriptase

PCR (RT-PCR). While CBB1001, CBB1002, CBB1005, and
CBB1009 could not activate the expression of these genes at
10 mmol/L (Fig. 3C), treatment of F9 cells with CBB1003,
CBB1004, and CBB1006 to CBB1008 led to the activation of
CHRM4 and SCN3A expression (Fig. 3C). Notably, we can detect
the activation of CHRM4 and SCN3A expression as low as 0.5
to 1 mmol/L of CBB1007 and 5 to 10 mmol/L of CBB1003
(Fig. 3D). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis at various
dose–response concentrations of CBB1003 and CBB1007
revealed that the IC50 vale of CBB1003 or CBB1007 is 8.45 or
3.74 mmol/L, respectively (Fig. 4A and B). We also found that
LSD1 inhibitors can markedly induce the expression of genes
for differentiation (Fig. 4A), such as FOXA2 (37), suggesting that

for the activity of LSD1 to demethylate H3K4.

Figure 5. LSD1 compounds selectively inhibit the growth of pluripotent embryonic carcinoma, teratocarcinoma, and seminoma cells but not non-pluripotent
cells. A and B, mouse F9 cells were treated with DMSO and 50 mmol/L LSD1 compounds CBB1001 to CBB1003 and CBB1007 for 30 hours and
the cell numbers were counted. CBB1003 and CBB1007 signiﬁcantly inhibit the growth of F9 cells but not CBB1001 and CBB1002. Percentage of compoundtreated cells relative to the control is shown in (B). C, dose–response of F9 cells to various concentrations of CBB1003 and CBB1007 as indicated for

Strikingly, we have noticed that treatment of CBB1003 and
CBB1007 led to signiﬁcant growth inhibition of mouse embryonic teratocarcinoma F9 cells (Fig. 5A–E), as analyzed by cell
doublings, MTT proliferation assays, and bromodeoxyuridine
(BrdUrd) incorporation. The growth-inhibitory effects of
CBB1003 and CBB1007 correlate with their ability to induce
mono- and dimethylations of H3K4 and the activation of
epigenetically suppressed gene expression (Figs. 3–5), suggesting that the growth inhibition is a consequence of speciﬁc LSD1
inhibition in F9 cells. Because CBB1002 can effectively inhibit
LSD1 activity in vitro with similar IC50 to that of CBB1003 and

www.aacrjournals.org

CBB1007, but it could not inhibit F9 cell growth and alter H3K4
methylation or gene expression in vivo, it is likely that only
CBB1003 and CBB1007 can enter the cell whereas CBB1002
cannot. To test this possibility, we examined whether F9 cells
can retain CBB1002, CBB1003, and CBB1007 after exposing to
the compounds for 2 hours. We found that while CBB1002 is
not detectable, both CBB1003 and CBB1007 can be readily
found in F9 cells by mass spectrometry (Fig. 4C). These results
suggest that modiﬁcation at the R position in the CBB chemical
scaffold (Fig. 1C and D) affects the cellular permeability of
these compounds.

HeLa, 293, and NIH3T3 cells do not express stem cell
markers Oct4 and Sox2 and are incapable of differentiation
and hence are considered non-stem cell lineage. To determine whether human teratocarcinoma cells or similar
pluripotent germ cell tumors are also sensitive to LSD1
inhibitors, human pluripotent mediastinal mixed germ
NCCIT cell, an intermediate cell between seminoma and
embryonic carcinoma, and pluripotent human testicular
embryonic carcinoma NTERA-2 cell were examined. We
found that the growth of both NCCIT and NTERA-2 cells
are highly sensitive to LSD1 inhibitors (Fig. 5G and H).
Because embryonic carcinoma and teratocarcinoma are
derived from pluripotent ES cells, we also tested whether
mouse ES cells are sensitive to LSD1 compounds. Treatment
of mouse ES cells with CBB1003 and CBB1007 also led to
substantial inhibition of the spherical growth of ES cells

The inhibitory effects of CBB compounds on F9 cells also
prompted us to examine whether LSD1 compounds can inhibit
other cancer or normal cells. A screen of various cultured cell
lines revealed that, consistent with previous reports (5, 15),
many cultured cancer or established somatic cell lines, such
as HeLa, 293, or NIH3T3 (Fig. 5G and H), did not display
any signiﬁcant growth inhibition after the treatment of
CBB1003 or CBB1007, even at relatively high concentrations
(100–200 mmol/L).
The mouse F9 cell is a pluripotent ES cell–like teratocarcinoma cell because it expresses pluripotent stem cell markers Oct4, Sox2, and Lin28. It also retains stem cell-like
properties such as rapid spherical growth and the ability to
differentiate (21, 24). Inoculation of F9 cells into the immunodeﬁcient mouse can induce teratocarcinomas which can
differentiate into a wide range of tissue types (24). However,

Novel LSD1 Demethylase Inhibitors Target Pluripotent Cancer Cells

(Fig. 6D). These studies indicate that embryonic carcinomas,
teratocarcinoma, seminomas, possibly other stem cell–
derived cells of pluripotent germ cell tumors (21) and ES
cells are particularly sensitive to LSD1 inhibitors, suggesting
that LSD1 plays an essential function in these pluripotent
cancer cells or ES cells.
LSD1 ablation selectively inhibits the growth of
pluripotent cancer cells
To conﬁrm the critical role of LSD1 in pluripotent cancer
cells and the speciﬁcity of LSD1 inhibitors, we analyzed the
effects of LSD1 ablation by siRNA in F9 and HeLa cells. After
ablating LSD1 expression with a speciﬁc siRNA targeted at
an mRNA region that is identical between mouse and human
LSD1 genes, only F9 cells displayed marked inhibition of cell
growth and BrdUrd incorporation but HeLa cells did not
(Figs. 6A–C and 5F). We also ablated LSD2 by siRNA to
determine whether it has any effects on the growth of these
cells. While LSD1 demethylates the methylated H3K4 in
certain promoter regions (1), LSD2 has a distinct function
to demethylate mono- and dimethylated H3K4 in the highly
transcribed coding region enriched with trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36; ref. 6). We found that ablation of
LSD2 by speciﬁc siRNAs caused the inhibition of HeLa cell
proliferation but not that of F9 cells (Fig. 6A–C). These
observations suggest that LSD1 compounds are speciﬁcally
target at LSD1 but not LSD2.
LSD1 expression is highly elevated in pluripotent cancer
cells
To determine the mechanism by which pluripotent F9,
NCCIT, and NTERA-2 cancer cells are selectively sensitive to
LSD1 inhibition or inactivation, LSD1 protein levels were
compared between these cells and HeLa and 293 cells. Our
analysis revealed that F9, NCCIT, and NTERA-2 cells express
high levels of LSD1 protein whereas the expression of LSD1
is much lower in HeLa and 293 cells (Fig. 6E). The elevated
levels of LSD1 are associated with the expression of pluripotent stem cell markers Oct4 and Sox2 (Fig. 6E), which are
not expressed in HeLa or 293 cells. In contrast, LSD2 is
relatively highly expressed in HeLa, 293, and NTERA-2 but is
very low in F9 and NCCIT cells (Fig. 6E). Our observation
suggests that the elevated levels of LSD1 may render F9, NCCIT,
and NTERA-2 cancer cells more dependent on LSD1, which may
consequently confer the selective sensitivity of these pluripotent cancer cells toward the loss of LSD1. In addition, we also
found that inactivation of LSD1 by treatment of LSD1 inhibitors
or siRNAs caused the signiﬁcant downregulation of Sox2 and
Oct4 expression (Fig. 6F), whereas the expression of other
proteins, such as CUL1 or actin, was not altered. Thus, by
regulating the stem cell–speciﬁc expression of Sox2 and Oct4
or probably other essential stem cell genes, LSD1 plays a unique
and essential role in the proliferation of many stem cell–like
pluripotent cancer cells.
We also wondered whether LSD1 serves as a good protein
marker for human teratocarcinomas, embryonic carcinomas,
seminomas, and other pluripotent germ cell tumors in situ
(21–23). By screening human seminoma tissue microarrays, we

or Oct4 (bottom) antibodies, 3 normal human testicular tissues were
examined, and all displayed low levels of LSD1 and Oct4. One of them is
shown (case D6). B, six human testicular seminomas were stained with
anti-LSD1 and Oct4 antibodies. All of them displayed elevated protein
levels of LSD1 and Oct4. One of the seminomas was shown (case C4).

found that while normal human testicular tissues surrounding
the tumors contain very low levels of LSD1 (Fig. 7A), immunostaining of tumor microarrays revealed that 6 of 6 human
testicular seminomas (100%) displayed high levels of LSD1
protein (Fig. 7B). These seminomas are likely to be pluripotent,
as they also express stem cell marker Oct4 (Fig. 7B; refs. 21–23).
The marked elevation of LSD1 protein levels in human testicular seminomas is consistent with our observation that pluripotent F9, NCCIT, and NTERA-2 cancer cells also contain
high levels of LSD1, Oct4, and Sox2 proteins and that these cells
are highly sensitive to LSD1 inhibitors.

Discussion
In this report, we have developed a new class of chemical
compounds that speciﬁcally inhibit histone demethylase
LSD1. Unlike previous monoamine oxidase inhibitors which
form a covalent chemical bond between FAD and the

Wang et al.

compounds and thus require high structural constraints of
the compounds (13, 14, 38), the new LSD1 inhibitors
speciﬁcally interact with LSD1 and inhibit its activity without forming a covalent bond (Fig. 1). The simplicity of
compound synthesis and the low spatial requirement
of compound interaction with LSD1 allow more ﬂexible,
efﬁcient, and rapid chemical synthesis schemes for further
diversiﬁed modiﬁcations to identify better compounds with
high afﬁnity, speciﬁcity, cell permeability, and stability. The
development of our LSD1 inhibitory compounds thus represents a new strategy to inhibit the activity of LSD1 to
modulate the epigenetic regulation of gene expression.
The speciﬁcity of new LSD1 inhibitors provides us a unique
tool to explore the biologic function of LSD1. By using these
compounds as a probe, we unexpectedly found that inhibition
of LSD1 selectively blocked the growth of pluripotent teratocarcinoma, embryonic carcinoma, seminoma, and ES cells,
likely due to their highly elevated levels of LSD1 expression
(Figs. 5–7). Many tissue-speciﬁc cancer stem cells, such as
breast, ovarian, and lung cancer stem cells, also express
Oct4 and Sox2 (39–41). Whether these cancer stem cells are
sensitive to our LSD1 inhibitors remains to be tested. One
additional use of our novel LSD1 inhibitors is to remove
teratomas/embryonic carcinomas during stem cell–based
therapy. One major problem in stem/iPS cell–based therapy
is the formation of embryonic carcinomas, teratomas, or
teratocarcinomas by incomplete differentiation of ES/iPS cells

in the organs of recipients (42). Removal of these tumors by
LSD1 inhibitors may ensure the successful application of
stem cell–based therapy. Our work thus suggests that LSD1
and methylation at H3K4 serve as novel targets for growth
inhibition of stem cell–like tumors for cancer therapy. While
epigenetic regulators constitute some appealing targets for
therapeutic inhibition, this study reveals the ﬁrst target
for which cancer stem cell selectivity may be achievable.
