Tumor-Surrogate Blood Vessel Subtypes Exhibit Differential
Susceptibility to Anti-VEGF Therapy
Basel Sitohy, Janice A. Nagy, Shou-Ching Shih Jaminet, and Harold F. Dvorak

Abstract
Antivascular therapy directed against VEGF or its receptors (VEGFR) has been successful when administered at
early stages of tumor vessel growth but is less effective when administered later. Tumor blood vessels are
heterogeneous, so vessel subpopulations may differ in their requirements for tumor cell–secreted VEGF and in
their susceptibility to anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapy. Human cancers contain several distinct blood vessel types,
including mother vessels (MV), glomeruloid microvascular proliferations (GMP), vascular malformations (VM),
feeding arteries (FA), and draining veins (DV), all of which can be generated in mice in the absence of tumor cells
using expression vectors for VEGF-A164. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity of each of these vessel types to
anti-VEGF therapy with Aﬂibercept (VEGF Trap), a potent inhibitor of VEGF-A164. Administering VEGF Trap
treatment before or shortly after injection of a recombinant VEGF-A164–expressing adenovirus could prevent or
regress tumor-free neovasculature, but it was progressively less effective if initiated at later times. Early-forming
MVs and GMPs in which the lining endothelial cells expressed high levels of VEGFR-2 were highly susceptible to
blockade by VEGF Trap. In contrast, late-forming VMs, FAs, and DVs that expressed low levels of VEGFR-2 were
largely resistant. Together, our ﬁndings deﬁne the susceptibility of different blood vessel subtypes to anti-VEGF
therapy, offering a possible explanation for the limited effectiveness of anti-VEGF-A/VEGFR treatment of
human cancers, which are typically present for months to years before discovery and are largely populated
by late-forming blood vessels. Cancer Res; 71(22); 7021–8. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Most tumors need to induce the formation of new blood
vessels if they are to grow beyond minimal size (1). They are
thought to do so, primarily, by expressing VEGF-A and particularly VEGF-A164 (mouse; human VEGF-A165; refs. 2, 3).
VEGF-A initiates signaling by binding to speciﬁc, plasma
membrane–associated receptors on vascular endothelial cells,
particularly VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2; Flk-1; ref. 4). Accordingly, VEGF and its receptors have been regarded as attractive
therapeutic targets. Antibodies against VEGF-A, as well as
tyrosine kinase inhibitors directed against VEGFR-2, are effective as monotherapy against many rapidly growing mouse
tumors (3); however, they have been of less beneﬁt when used
in treating cancer patients. Bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech,
a humanized anti-VEGF-A antibody) prolongs the life expectancy of patients with advanced colon cancer by an average of
only 4 to 5 months, even when used in conjunction with triple

chemotherapy (5), and has not lengthened life expectancy in
several other cancers (6).
It has been known for some time that tumor blood vessels
are not of a single type (7), and this heterogeneity raises the
possibility that different types of tumor blood vessels might be
differentially sensitive to anti-VEGF or anti-VEGFR therapy.
Human tumors are typically present for months or years before
discovery and therefore could be supplied by a different
population of blood vessels than rapidly growing transplantable mouse tumors. Thus, the difference in outcome between
many human and mouse cancers could reﬂect differences in
blood vessel type, their differential requirements for tumorsecreted VEGF-A, and therefore their differential sensitivity to
anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapies.
Testing this hypothesis requires detailed knowledge of the
different types of blood vessels present in tumors and their
properties, and few attempts have been made to classify tumor
blood vessels rigorously (7). Recently, we categorized the
different blood vessels present in several important human
cancers (8, 9) and identiﬁed the following structurally distinct
abnormal vessel types: mother vessels (MV), glomeruloid
microvascular proliferations (GMP), and vascular malformations (VM). Of these vessel types, GMPs were most prominent
in glioblastoma multiforme, but the other vessel types were all
prominently represented in human colon, kidney, and ovarian
cancers (8, 9). In addition, highly abnormal, enlarged feeding
arteries (FA) and draining veins (DV) supply and drain the
angiogenic, intratumor and immediately paratumor blood
vessels, that is, MVs, GMPs, and VMs.

Investigating the differential susceptibility of these vessel
subtypes to anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapies in human cancer
patients is difﬁcult. Therefore, we developed an animal model
in which each of these blood vessel types is replicated in a
highly reproducible manner in nude mice in the absence of
tumor cells using an adenoviral vector that expresses VEGFA164 (10). This reductionist mouse model has allowed us to
analyze the sequential steps and mechanisms by which each
type of new pathologic blood vessel forms and to characterize
their functional properties (10). MVs, GMPs, and VMs developed from preexisting postcapillary venules by a process of
angiogenesis, whereas FAs and DVs developed by arteriovenogenesis from preexisting arteries and veins.
The present studies were undertaken to determine which of
the different tumor-surrogate blood vessel types induced by
Ad-VEGF-A164 were or were not susceptible to anti-VEGF-A
therapy. To that end, we used Aﬂibercept (VEGF Trap), a
human soluble decoy receptor protein created by fusion of
portions of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 to the Fc segment of IgG1
(11). VEGF Trap has high afﬁnity for all of the isoforms of
VEGF-A, VEGF-B, and placental growth factor, but it does not
bind VEGF-C. We now report that VEGF Trap potently inhibited both angiogenesis and arteriovenogenesis when administered prior to Ad-VEGF-A164 and at least partially regressed
angiogenic and arteriovenogenic blood vessels when administered up to several weeks thereafter. However, VEGF Trap
was without signiﬁcant effect when therapy was delayed until 2
months after Ad-VEGF-A164 when "late" vessels, VMs, FAs, and
DVs predominated. The endothelial cells lining these late
vessels, in contrast to those of the highly susceptible MVs and
GMPs, expressed little or no VEGFR-2. These ﬁndings could
have important implications for understanding the limited
effectiveness of anti-VEGF/VEGFR treatments in human cancer, where "late" blood vessels that have acquired independence from tumor-secreted VEGF-A are likely to predominate.

Materials and Methods
Animal model, treatment with VEGF Trap, and histology
A total of 107 plaque-forming units (PFU) of Ad-VEGF-A164 in
10 mL PBS/3% glycerol were injected into the ears of female
athymic nude mice (National Cancer Institute) and 5  108 PFU
in 50 mL PBS/3% glycerol were injected into ﬂank skin (12).
Animals were injected subcutaneously with Aﬂibercept (VEGF
Trap, 25 mg/kg; Regeneron) or equivalent control peptide
(human Fc fragment that serves as the backbone of VEGF
Trap) as in Table 1 (11). Twelve or more mice, equally matched,
were used per group. Ears and ﬂanks were viewed and photographed in a dissecting microscope. All animal studies were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
For histology, tissues were ﬁxed in K2 ﬁxative and embedded
in Epon for Giemsa-stained, 1 mm-Epon sections (13). Immunohistochemistry was carried out on 4% paraformaldehydeﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tissues with antibodies to VEGFR-2
as previously described (13).

Vascular casting with Microﬁl
Mice anesthetized with avertin (200 mg/kg) and injected
intravenously with 100 units of heparin were perfused through
the left ventricle with 60 mL prewarmed, heparinized saline at
80 mm Hg, followed by sufﬁcient Microﬁl (MV-122, Flow Tech,
Inc.) at 120 mm Hg to ﬁll the entire circulatory system. After 18
to 24 hours at 4 C, tissues were dehydrated in glycerol as per
manufacturer's instructions and photographed.
Quantiﬁcation of intravascular plasma volume and
plasma leak
We improved a 2-tracer method to quantify intravascular
plasma volume and plasma albumin leakage, measures of total
blood vessel formation and vascular permeability, respectively
(12). At time zero, mice were injected intravenously with 0.1 mL
of 0.5% Evans blue dye, which binds to plasma albumin. Immediately thereafter, a sample of blood (100 mL) was taken by retroorbital puncture into 10 mL of heparin (1,000 units per mL).
Twenty-ﬁve minutes later, a second intravenous injection was
administered, this time of 10 mCi 125I-albumin (in 0.1 mL of
Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.1% bovine serum
albumin as carrier), and another sample of blood (100 mL) was
taken immediately by retro-orbital puncture into 10 mL of
heparin (1,000 units per mL). Five minutes later, at time 30 minutes, mice were euthanized and Ad-VEGF-A164 injection sites
were carefully harvested to minimize blood loss (8-mm punch
biopsy for ear samples and 10-mm punch biopsy for ﬂank
samples), weighed, and subjected to g-counting. The collected
blood samples were centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 10 minutes) to
pellet blood cells, and the plasma was removed and stored at 4 C.
Tissues were extracted in 1 mL of formamide for at least 48 hours
at 56 C. The absorbance at 620 nm of the tissue extract was
determined by spectrophotometry and converted to the amount
(micrograms) of Evans blue tracer in each sample using a
standard curve. The concentrations of Evans blue dye and
125
I-albumin in the corresponding plasma samples were also
determined by spectrometry and g-counting, respectively, and
these values were used to convert the tissue tracer values into
microliters of plasma or microliters of plasma per gram of tissue.
An underlying assumption of this method is that even in the case
of highly leaky blood vessels only negligible amounts of 125Ialbumin will have had time to extravasate at 5 minutes after
injection. Therefore, the 125I-albumin value at 5 minutes provides a quantitative measure of intravascular plasma volume,
whereas the Evans blue albumin value at 30 minutes provides a

Results
Effect of VEGF Trap on the neovascular response induced
by Ad-VEGF-A164
Ad-VEGF-A164 induces the formation of tumor-surrogate
blood vessels in nude mice by 2 parallel processes: angiogenesis
and arteriovenogenesis (9, 10). The response begins within a
day, evolves over a period of weeks to months, and leaves
behind a substantial number of newly formed blood vessels
that persist indeﬁnitely (>1 year). VEGF Trap (or control
peptide) was administered at various times before and after
Ad-VEGF-A164 injection (Table 1). Ad-VEGF-A164 injected into
mice treated with control peptide induced a strong neovascular response in both ears and ﬂank skin that was identical to
that in mice receiving Ad-VEGF-A164 alone (Fig. 1). VEGF Trap
profoundly diminished the macroscopic vascular response
induced by Ad-VEGF-A164 in groups 1 to 4 mice but had no
apparent effect on group 5 mice (Fig. 1). Mice in none of the
groups exhibited any signs of toxicity.
Effect of VEGF Trap on the different subtypes of new
blood vessels induced by Ad-VEGF-A164
In both ears and ﬂank skin, MVs are the ﬁrst new angiogenic
vessel subtype to form (9, 10). They are greatly enlarged,

pericyte-poor, hyperpermeable blood vessels that develop from
preexisting normal venules as the result of basement membrane degradation and pericyte detachment (9, 10, 14). MVs
peak on day 5, at the time of maximal intravascular volume and
plasma protein leakage [Figs. 2, control peptide (C) group 1,
and 3A]. Consistent with their hyperpermeability to plasma
proteins, injection sites exhibited extensive edema (Fig. 2,
group 1 control). Subsequently, MVs evolved over 4 to 6 weeks
into several distinct types of "daughter" blood vessels, including
GMPs and VMs (Fig. 2, control group 4). GMPs are poorly
organized vascular clusters that resemble renal glomeruli
macroscopically (hence their name) and are composed of
pericyte-coated, endothelial cell–lined, minimally sized vascular channels with reduplicated basement membranes (Fig. 3C;
refs. 9, 10). VMs are large, tortuous vessels that derive from MVs
by acquiring an often asymmetrical smooth muscle coat and
are the only angiogenic vessel subtype that persists beyond 2
months (Fig. 3E; refs. 9, 10). Arteriovenogenesis develops in
parallel with angiogenesis as preexisting small arteries and
veins remodel and enlarge to form FAs and DVs that supply the
angiogenic vasculature and, like VMs, persist indeﬁnitely
(Figs. 1, 2, and 3E and F). At 61 days and later times, VMs,
FAs, and DVs were the predominant Ad-VEGF-A164–induced
blood vessel types present (Fig. 2, group 5).
VEGF Trap profoundly affected Ad-VEGF-A164–induced
angiogenesis and arteriovenogenesis, but its effectiveness was
highly dependent on the time of administration. When injected
prior to Ad-VEGF-A164, MV formation, vascular permeability
and edema were largely prevented [Figs. 2, treated (T) group 1,
and 3B]. When injected up to one month after Ad-VEGF-A164
injection, VEGF Trap–treated mice exhibited only rare, small
GMPs, fewer VMs, and smaller FAs and DVs, and considerably
less edema than controls (Figs. 2, T group 4, and Fig. 3D).
However, when treatment was delayed for 2 months (group 5),

edema (compare lengths of red vertical arrows). Group 4 (31 days), control peptide–treated ears remain thickened and exhibit extensive GMPs as well as VMs
(FAs and DVs not shown). Ears of VEGF Trap–treated mice are of near normal thickness and show fewer and smaller new blood vessels. Group 5 (61 days), ear
thickness, VMs, FAs, and DVs are equivalent in VEGF Trap- and control peptide–treated mice. Both show extensive ﬁbrous connective tissue stroma and
numerous mast cells (arrows). L, lymphatics; C, ear cartilage. Magniﬁcation bars, 50 mm.

VEGF Trap had almost no inhibitory effect. VMs, FAs, and DVs
were indistinguishable from controls in VEGF Trap–treated
mice (Fig. 3E and F) and both treated and control groups
developed an equivalent mast cell–rich, ﬁbrous connective
tissue stroma, similar to that found in desmoplastic tumors
(Fig. 2, group 5).
VEGFR-2 (Flk-1) expression levels in different blood
vessel types induced by Ad-VEGF-A164
A possible reason for the failure of late vessels to respond to
VEGF Trap is a loss of their dependence on exogenous (i.e., AdVEGF-A164–induced) VEGF-A. To test this possibility, we carried out immunohistochemistry on the different vessel types to
assess changes in VEGFR-2 expression. MV and GMP endothelial cells stained strongly for VEGFR-2 whereas those lining
VMs, FAs and DVs stained weakly or not at all (Fig. 4).
Quantiﬁcation of intravascular volume and vascular
leak
We reﬁned a double tracer method that we had developed
earlier (12) to provide an unbiased, quantitative measure of
both the extent of new blood vessel formation (intravascular
volume) and the extent of vascular leakage. This method is
superior to measures evaluating vascular density for quantifying angiogenesis in that it the takes into account the entire
vasculature within a prescribed tissue volume, thus avoiding
the problems of vascular variability in different regions and the
associated risk of sampling bias. It is also superior to the classic
Miles assay in that it clearly distinguishes between dye–albumin complex that is within versus that which is outside the
vasculature. Using this method, we showed that Ad-VEGF-A164
induced a dramatic increase in intravascular plasma volume in

7024

Cancer Res; 71(22) November 15, 2011

both ear and ﬂank skin of mice receiving control peptide
(Fig. 5); peak levels were observed on day 5, at the height of
MV formation, and persisted thereafter, though at somewhat
lower levels. By day 61, intravascular plasma volume remained
signiﬁcantly elevated, approximately twice that of normal
plasma volumes in both ear and ﬂank skin. Leakage of plasma
albumin was also dramatically increased in Ad-VEGF-A164–
injected mice receiving control peptide; again maximum leakage was observed at 5 days and declined progressively thereafter until little (ears) or no (ﬂank skin) leakage was detected at
31 days and none at 61 days (both ears and ﬂank skin). This was
expected as MVs and GMPs, hyperpermeable blood vessels,
had by that time been largely replaced by "late" vessels (VMs,
FAs, and DVs) that are not hyperpermeable (9, 10).
VEGF Trap substantially reduced both intravascular plasma
volume and plasma albumin leak in both ear and ﬂank skin of
groups 1 to 4 mice (Fig. 5). However, at 61 days, intravascular
plasma volumes in both ears and ﬂank skin of group 5 control
peptide mice remained elevated approximately 2-fold above
those of normal levels, and these volumes were not signiﬁcantly diminished by VEGF Trap.

Discussion
VEGF Trap effectively prevented both angiogenesis and
arteriovenogenesis when administered prior to injection of
Ad-VEGF-A164. In group 1 VEGF Trap–treated mice, new blood
vessels largely failed to develop and increases in intravascular
plasma volume, permeability, and edema were minimal
(Figs. 1–3 and 5). When VEGF Trap was instead administered
at intervals up to one month after Ad-VEGF-A164 injection, the
MVs, GMPs, and early VMs that had formed regressed, and

vascular volumes and associated leakage were greatly reduced;
arteriovenogenesis was also inhibited. However, VEGF Trap
was largely ineffective when treatment was delayed until 2
months after Ad-VEGF-A164 injection (Figs. 1–3 and 5). At this
late time, angiogenesis had largely passed through the stages of
MVs and GMPs to form fully developed VMs, and arteriovenogenesis had proceeded to form well-developed FAs and DVs.
Thus, VEGF Trap prevented new blood vessel formation and
efﬁciently regressed "early" blood vessels (MVs and GMPs)
induced by Ad-VEGF-A164; however, it had essentially no effect
on the "late" blood vessels induced either by angiogenesis
(VMs) or arteriovenogenesis (FAs and DVs). Thus, although
all of the new blood vessels were induced by VEGF-A, not all
remained sensitive to anti-VEGF-A therapy. Results consistent
with ours were recently reported in a model involving hypoxiainducible factor 1a (HIF-1a)-overexpressing keratinocytes;
antibodies against VEGFR-2 were quite effective in preventing
angiogenesis induction but were much less effective when
administration was delayed for 2 weeks after the onset of
angiogenesis (15).
One possible explanation for the insensitivity of VMs, FAs,
and DVs to VEGF Trap is that their lining endothelial cells have
lost dependence on exogenous VEGF-A and that any requirement for VEGF-A as a survival factor has been met by the
pericytes or smooth muscle cells that closely envelop them.

www.aacrjournals.org

VEGF-A delivered to endothelial cells by a paracellular mechanism from closely apposed smooth muscle cells would likely
not be accessible to VEGF Trap. Evidence in favor of this
possibility was obtained from immunohistochemistry; MVs
and GMPs expressed extremely high levels of VEGFR-2 staining, whereas VMs, FAs, and DVs expressed very low or undetectable levels (Fig. 4).
Insufﬁcient attention has been paid in the literature to the
heterogeneity of the tumor vasculature and to the origins and
speciﬁc properties of the different types of tumor blood vessels
and their susceptibility to anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapy. A number of reports indicate that vessel types variously described
as "pericyte-coated," "a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA)–positive," "mature," "normalized," "stable," "established," or "large"
are resistant to such therapy in mouse and/or human cancers
(16–22), whereas vessels described as "immature," "dilated," or
"unstable" are sensitive (17, 23–25). However, there are exceptions to this pattern of differential sensitivity, as VEGF Trap has
been reported to regress smooth muscle–coated blood vessels
in at least some tumor models (26, 27). In any event, the speciﬁc
types of resistant or sensitive vessels, their mode of formation,
their detailed properties, and their relationships to the vascular
categories we have described in human tumors and in the
tumor-surrogate vessels induced by Ad-VEGF-A164 have not
previously been well-deﬁned.

Our results with VEGF Trap agree with reports of antiVEGF/VEGFR therapy in a number of different mouse cancers.
Anti-VEGF antibodies and/or small molecule VEGFR inhibitors have been found to inhibit the growth of many transplantable, VEGF-secreting mouse tumors and tumor xenografts (3, 17, 28, 29). Review of the literature and our own data
indicate that MVs are the predominant vessel type, at least
during early stages of growth, in at least the following tumors,
many of which have been treated effectively with anti-VEGF/
VEGFR approaches: mouse B16 melanomas, Lewis lung carcinomas, MOT, TA3/St mammary carcinoma, guinea pig line 1
and 10 bile duct carcinomas (refs. 30, 31; our unpublished data),
and, as best as can be determined from published photomicrographs, early stages of the autochthonous Rip-Tag2 tumor
(29). Therefore, it may be safely presumed that MVs are the
primary vessel subtype susceptible to anti-VEGF/VEGFR treatment. Additional strong evidence for this conclusion comes
from the ﬁnding that anti-VEGF/VEGFR drugs potently inhibit
tumor vascular hyperpermeability (24, 32, 33). In the pathologic
angiogenesis induced by tumors or Ad-VEGF-A164, MVs (and to
a lesser extent GMPs) are the only hyperpermeable blood
vessels (9, 10).
In contrast to their effectiveness in early mouse tumors
populated largely by MVs, anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapies have
been much less effective at later stages of growth in mouse
tumors and have had only limited effectiveness in treating
human cancers (5, 6). One explanation is that tumor cells

exposed to these therapies begin to express new growth factors
such as members of the ﬁbroblast growth factor family,
angiopoietins, and interleukin-6, thereby circumventing the
need for VEGF-A (17, 28, 34, 35). However, an additional
explanation is that, over time, the tumor vasculature evolves
to form "late" blood vessels (VMs, FAs, and DVs) that are not
susceptible to VEGF/VEGFR inhibition. Human cancers in
particular are commonly present for many months or years
before they are discovered and so have sufﬁcient time to form
large numbers of "late" blood vessels. Quantiﬁcation of the
relative numbers of each vessel type in resected human carcinomas is an impossible task, but we have shown that, at the
very least, important human carcinomas (e.g., colon, breast,
ovary, and kidney) contain large numbers of VMs, FAs, and DVs
(8, 9).
Our data also offer an alternative interpretation of the
"normalizing" effect that anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapies have on
the tumor vasculature. Normalization refers to the decrease in
vascular permeability, edema, and interstitial tissue pressure
induced by anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapies (36, 37). We suggest

that these therapies, as here with Ad-VEGF-A164–induced
angiogenesis, selectively attack MVs (and GMPs when present), as these are the only tumor blood vessels known to be
hyperpermeable to plasma proteins; edema and increased
interstitial hyperpermeability, of course, result from increased
vascular permeability. Left behind, then are relatively unaffected pericyte- and smooth muscle–coated VMs, FAs, and
DVs; that is, vessels that by radiological examination and
immunocytochemistry seem relatively normal in that they are
smooth muscle cell coated, smaller on average than MVs, and
not hyperpermeable to circulating macromolecules.
In summary, we have shown that speciﬁc, well-deﬁned
subsets of VEGF-A–induced blood vessels (MVs and GMPs)
are sensitive to VEGF Trap therapy whereas other vessel
subsets (VMs, FAs, and DVs) are not. Because VEGF Trap
potently binds to and inactivates VEGF-A, these data are
likely representative of data obtained with Avastin or VEGFR
inhibitors and thus may help to explain the limited beneﬁt of
anti-VEGF/VEGFR therapy in treating human cancers. We

suggest that antivascular therapy could be improved by
ﬁnding new targets on late tumor blood vessels, that is,
those vessels that are not susceptible to anti-VEGF/VEGFR
therapy.
