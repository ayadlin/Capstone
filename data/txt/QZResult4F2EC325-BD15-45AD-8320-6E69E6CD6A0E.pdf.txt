ABSTRACT
5-FU is a common first-line chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of
hepatocellular carcinoma. However the development of acquired resistance to 5-FU
confines its clinical usages. Although this phenomenon has been the subject of intense
investigation, the exact mechanism of acquired resistance to 5-FU remains elusive.
Here, we report that over-expression of GRP78 contributes to acquired resistance
to 5-FU in HCC by up-regulating the c-Src/LSF/TS axis. Moreover, we found that
the resistance to 5-FU conferred by GRP78 is mediated by its ATPase domain. The
ATPase domain differentially increased the expression of LSF, TS and promoted the
phosphorylation of ERK and Akt. We further identified that GRP78 interacts physically
with c-Src through its ATPase domain and promotes the phosphorylation of c-Src,
which in turn increases the expression of LSF in the nucleus. Together, GRP78 confers
the resistance to 5-FU by up-regulating the c-Src/LSF/TS axis via its ATPase domain.

INTRODUCTION

treatment and confines its use in clinical practice [9-11].
Many signaling pathways have been demonstrated to
contribute to the resistance to 5-FU [12, 13]. Among them,
the LSF/TS axis plays a decisive role in the development
of 5-FU resistance [14]. Late SV40 factor (LSF) is
overexpressed in HCC and functions as a transcriptional
activator and repressor, activating the transcription
of target genes including SAA3, IL-4, α-globin and
PAX6[15]. Recent progress has identified TS, which
encodes the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of dTTP,
as one of the downstream regulators of LSF [14]. LSF
contributes largely to the development of 5-FU resistance
by binding to TS promotes, up-regulating the expression
of TS.
Glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78) is a
member of the heat shock protein 70 family [16, 17] and
protects cells from apoptosis under stress conditions [18,

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth
common cancer worldwide whose mortality rate parallels
with its incidence [1]. Rapid growth and early vascular
invasion are the most important characteristics of HCC
[2-4]. The treatment options for HCC depend on the
stages and grades of this disease. For the patients with
advanced stages, systemic therapy is still a very important
option. To date, 5-FU is still a common therapeutic drug
for the systemic therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. For
example, a combination of cisplatin, IFN, doxorubicin
and 5-FU (PIAF) was being widely used for the treatment
of advanced HCC [5-7]. Unfortunately, it has improved
survival in a very limited extent [8].
The development of 5-FU resistance is a common
phenomenon in HCC patients who underwent 5-FU

19]. It is overexpressed in many human cancers and plays
critical role in the regulation of cellular proliferation[20,
21], invasion[22], metastasis and survival[23, 24].
Many data have demonstrated that overexpression of
GRP78 causes the resistance to many chemotherapeutic
agents including cisplatin, (−)-epigallocatechin gallate,
temozolomide, doxorubicin and 5-FU in many human
solid tumors such as breast[25, 26], lung, gastric
cancers[27-29]. Up to now, little is known about the role
of GRP78 in the development of 5-FU resistance in HCC.
In this report, we investigated the role of 5-FU in
regulation of hepatocellular carcinoma sensitivity to 5-FU
and the underlying mechanism by which GRP78 confers
resistance to 5-FU. We found that high GRP78 level
enhanced resistance to 5-FU. Overexpression of GRP78
activated c-Src phosphorylation which, in turn, elevated
LSF/TS axis in HCC cells. Thus these results provide
new insights into the mechanism of 5-FU resistance, and
treatment of HCC with 5-FU in combination with PP2
increased the efficacy of 5-FU.

Over-expression of GRP78 confers resistance to
5-FU in HCC cells in vitro
Over-expression of GRP78 is associated with
resistance to chemical drugs in many human cancers.
However, the contribution of GRP78 to the resistance to
5-FU in HCC has not been previously explored. Using
western blot, we examined GRP78 levels in a panel of 6
HCC cell lines and found a high variation in expression.
As shown in Figure 1a, QGY-7703 cells expressed
GRP78 at higher level as compared with other cell lines.
In contrast, HepG2, PLC and Hep3B cells expressed
GRP78 at relatively lower level. Malhavu, SMMC7721
cells expressed GRP78 at intermediate level. Subsequent
cell viability analysis in QGY-7703, SMMC7721 and
HepG2 cells showed the sensitivity to 5-FU differs widely
in these HCC cell lines. The response efficacy to 5-FU is
the lowest in QGY-7703 cells, by contrast it is the highest
in HepG2 cells, raising the possibility that the expression
level of GRP78 may be associated with the sensitivity of
HCC cells to 5-FU (Figure 1b).
To investigate whether GRP78 overexpression
is sufficient to confer the resistance to 5-FU, HepG2

cells were engineered to stably express EGFP (HepG2Vec) or EGFP-tagged GRP78 (HepG2-GRP78) (Figure
1c). HepG2 cells were chosen because they expressed
GRP78 at a relatively lower level as compared with the
other cells we have examined. When comparing the
sensitivity to 5-FU, overexpression of GRP78 significantly
increased cell viability in HepG2 cells, reaching an IC50
that was almost some 5 fold higher than that of HepG2Vec cells(Figure 1d). By contrast, down-regulation of
GRP78 in QGY-7703 cells using GRP78 specific siRNAs
markedly decreased cell viability when treated with 5-FU,
indicating that GRP78 could confer resistance to 5-FU in
HCC (Figure 1e, 1f).

suggesting that deletion of ATPase and PBD did not alter
the cellular localization of GRP78 (Figure 2a). Western
blot analysis showed that GRP78, delATPase or delPBD
was overexpressed in HepG2 cells as compared with
endogenous GRP78(Figure 2b).
We next determined the function of ATPase and
PBD domain in GRP78 mediated 5-FU resistance in
HepG2 cells using cell viability assay. As shown in Figure
2c, overexpression of delPBD mutant of GRP78 in HepG2
cells shared a parallel cell viability ratio as compared with
that of GRP78. By contrast, overexpression of delATPase
mutant caused a marked decrease in cell viability ratio
as compared with that of GRP78, indicating that GRP78
determines the sensitivity of HCC cells to 5-FU by its
ATPase domain. This conclusion was further supported
by the fact that overexpression of GRP78 or its delPBD
mutant caused a marked decrease in 5-FU induced cell
apoptosis as compared with that in cells overexpressing
delATPase (Figure 2d, S1c). In addition, we found that
overexpression of delPBD promoted the invasion and
migration of HepG2 cells. However, overexpression of
delATPase inhibited the invasion and migration of HepG2
cells, suggesting that GRP78 promotes the invasion and
migration of HepG2 cells by its ATPase domain (Figure
S2).

The ATPase domain of GRP78 determines the
sensitivity to 5-FU in HCC cells
To determine the role of ATPase and PBD domains
of GRP78 in the acquired resistance to 5-FU conferred
by GRP78, we established EGFP tagged ATPase or PBD
domain deleted mutant (abbreviated as delATPase and
delPBD) (Figure S1a, b) and introduced these mutants
into HepG2 cells using lipofectamine2000. As indicated
by TRITC-conjugated ER-tracker, delATPase and
delPBD mutants are localized in the ER and cytoplasm,

in the nucleus. Quantitative analysis showed that both
GRP78 and LSF were expressed at higher levels in poorly
differentiated tissue samples as compared with that in
well differentiated tissue samples (Tables 2, 3). Statistical
spearman analysis indicated that the expression level
of Grp78 was positively correlated with that of LSF in
HCC (Table 4) (p<0.05). These findings were extended by
western blot analysis of LSF expression in hepatocellular

To identify whether LSF is one of GRP78downstream genes, we investigated whether GRP78
could increase LSF expression. We first examined the
expression of GRP78 and LSF in 44 cases of surgery
resected HCC tissue sample using immunohistological
staining. The clinicopathological data were summarized in
Table1. As shown in Figure 3a, both GRP78 and LSF were
expressed in HCC tissue samples. GRP78 was expressed

LSF at considerably higher level as compared with
HepG2, and SMMC7721, while HepG2 cells expressed
LSF at relatively lower level (Figure 3b-3c).
We next investigated whether overexpression of
GRP78 elevated LSF expression in HepG2 cells. Using
RT-PCR, we found a marked increase of LSF mRNA in
HepG2-GRP78 cells as compared with that in HepG2Vec cells (Figure 3d, upper). Similar results were obtained
using western blot analysis (Figure 3d, bottom). Further
quantitative analysis revealed that LSF mRNA increased
at a parallel extent with that of LSF protein in HepG2GRP78 cells, suggesting that GRP78 regulates LSF
expression at the transcriptional level (Figure 3e). The
effect of GRP78 overexpression on the nuclear expression
of LSF was also examined by fractionating the cytosolic
and nuclear compartments and analyzing LSF expression
using Western blot. We found that LSF was expressed at
higher level in the nucleus in HepG2-GRP78 cells than

that in HepG2-Vec cells (Figure 3f, 3g). This conclusion
was also confirmed in HepG2-GRP78 and HepG2-Vec
cells by immunocytochemical staining using anti-LSF
antibody (Figure S3a). Our results further revealed that
knockdown of GRP78 in QGY-7703 cells significantly
decreased LSF (Figure S3b).These data suggested that
overexpression of GRP78 could increase LSF level
transcriptionally, indicating LSF lies downstream of
GRP78 in HCC.
We next determined LSF is involved in the GRP78
mediated resistance to 5-FU. HepG2-GRP78 cells were
transfected with siRNA against LSF (Figure S3c) and
the content of growth inhibition was examined using cell
viability assay in the presence of 5-FU. We found that
Knockdown of LSF significantly decreased cell viability
of HepG2-GRP78 cells when treated with 5-FU (Figure
3h).Flow cytometry revealed that knockdown of LSF
enhanced cell apoptosis induced by 5-FU (Figure 3i, S3d).

axis is involved in GRP78 conferred 5-FU resistance, We
treated QGY-7703 cells with exogenous thymidine (20
μM) in the presence of 5-FU and observed the enhanced
cell death induced by 5-FU in QGY-7703 cells transfected
with GRP78 specific siRNAs could be rescued by addition
of exogenous thymidine, indicating that the resistance to
5-FU conferred by GRP78 is dependent on TS (Figure 4a).

GRP78 caused a significant decrease in the expression
of TS (Figure 4b, 4c). As a corollary, overexpression of
GRP78 in HepG2 cells increased TS expression (Figure
4d, 4e), indicating that the LSF/TS axis is involved in
GRP78 conferred resistance to 5-FU. We also found
that overexpression of GRP78 significantly increased
the phosphorylation of ERK, Gab1 and Akt, but did not
affected the expression of these proteins (Figure 4d, 4e).
To further identify the role of ATPase or PBD
domain of GRP78 in the regulation of the LSF/TS

axis, LSF and TS levels in HepG2 cells overexpressing
delATPase or delPBD were determined using western blot.
As compared with GRP78, overexpression of delATPase
caused a marked decrease in TS and LSF, while delPBD
did not affect the expression of TS and LSF, indicating
that GRP78 up-regulated the LSF/TS axis via its ATPase
domain (Figure 4f, 4g). As indicated by Figure 4f and 4g,
the ATPase domain of GRP78 also plays critical roles in
phosphorylation of ERK and Akt.

We

performed
anti-EGFP
coimmunoprecipitation in HepG2 cells transfected with
EGFP-tagged GRP78, delATP and delPBD. Anti-EGFP
co-immunoprecipitation showed that GRP78 interacted
with c-Src through the ATPase domain (Figure 5b). This
conclusion was further supported by co-localization
of GRP78 or delPBD with c-Src in HepG2 cells cotransfected with DsRed tagged c-Src and EGFP-tagged
GRP78 or delPBD; however no co-localization is observed
in HepG2 cells co-transfected with c-Src and EGFP tagged
delATPase (Figure 5c).
To address whether the interaction between
GRP78 and c-Src is direct, we further performed GSTpulldown in HepG2 cells using GST-tagged GRP78,

To identify the signaling molecules responsible for
activating the LSF/TS axis, two-hybrid (Y2H) screening
was performed using human GRP78 as the bait in

as a potential GRP78 interacting protein. GRP78-c-Src
interaction was determined by colony formation on yeast
SD-Leu-Trp-His-Aba (SD-4) selection media and plate
assays for β-galactosidase activity (Figure 5a line 1-2).
On this basis, we explored the role of ATPase and PBD

Y2H and found that this interaction was mediated by the

c-Src was presented in the precipitations of GST-GRP78
and delPBD, but not presented in GST-delATPase
precipitation. These data suggested that GRP78 could
interact directly with c-Src by its ATPase domain.
Since GRP78 could directly interact with c-Src
through its ATPase domain. We further investigated
whether GRP78 promotes c-Src phosphorylation. Western
blot analysis showed that overexpression of GRP78
in HepG2 cells caused a significant increase in the
phosphorylation of c-Src (pY416) (Figure 6a-6b), while
knockdown of GRP78 in QGY-7703 cells significantly
decreased c-Src phosphorylation (Figure 6c-6d). We
further examined the role of ATPase and PBD domain
of GRP78 in the regulation of c-Src phosphorylation and
found that c-Src phosphorylation was almost not detected
in HepG2 cells transfected with delATPase, indicating
GRP78 facilitated c-Src phosphorylation through its
ATPase domain (Figure 6e-6f).

of c-Src significantly decreased the viability of HepG2GRP78 cells when treated with 5-FU (Figure 8a). Flow
cytometry analysis showed that treatment of HepG2GRP78 cells transfected with c-Src siRNA with 5-FU
significantly facilitated cell apoptosis as compared
with control cells (Figure 8b, S4a). Similar results were
obtained in QGY-7703 cells transfected with c-Src siRNA
(Figure 8c-8d, S4c).
We next determined the effect of 5-FU in
combination with PP2 on cell viability and apoptosis in
HepG2-GRP78 cells and QGY-7703 cells. We found that
treatment with 5-FU in combination with PP2 caused a
significant decreased cell viability as compared with that
treated with 5-FU or PP2 alone in HepG2-GRP78(Figure
8e) and QGY-7703 cells (Figure 8g). Consistently,
treatment with 5-FU in combination with PP2 caused a
significant increased cell apoptosis as compared with that
treated with 5-FU or PP2 alone in HepG2-GRP78 (Figure
8f, S4b) and QGY-7703 cells (Figure 8h, S4d).
We next determined whether inhibition of c-Src
could increase the sensitivity of HepG2 cells to 5-FU in
vivo in an ectopic xenograft model. HepG2-GRP78 cells
were injected subcutaneously into athymic nude mice. 2
weeks after injection, when tumor volume reached ~100
mm2, mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections
of PBS, PP2 (5mg/kg/d), 5-FU (50mg/kg/d) or PP2 /5FU (5mg/kg/d, 50mg/kg/d) twice a week over 14 days.
Consistent with in vitro experiments, 5-FU treatment
caused a mild reduction in tumor weight in HepG2GRP78 tumors relative to that in HepG2-Vec tumors. In
contrast, treatment of HepG2-GRP78 tumors with 5-FU
in combination with PP2 markedly reduced tumor weight
(Figure 9a-9c).

Targeting of c-Src decreased the LSF/TS axis
It has been reported previously that c-Src plays
critical roles in the resistance to many chemical agents in
human cancers including pancreatic, colorectal, breast and
liver cancer cells. For this reason, we examined whether
c-Src regulates the expression of LSF. For this purpose,
HepG2-GRP78 cells were transfected with siRNA against
c-Src (Figure 7a-7b) and western blot analysis revealed
that knockdown of c-Src caused a significant decrease in
LSF level. This conclusion was further validated by the
fact that inhibition of c-Src with PP2 (10μM) significantly
decreased LSF expression in HepG2-GRP78 cells (Figure
7c-7d). Further analysis revealed that either transfection
of c-Src siRNA or treatment with PP2 caused a significant
decrease in LSF level in the nuclear extract as compared
with that in control cells (Figure 7e-7f). Similar results
were obtained by immunohistochemical staining in
HepG2-GRP78 cells treated by c-Src siRNA or PP2 using
anti-LSF antibody (Figure S3e). On the basis of these
results, we next investigated whether c-Src upregulates
the expression of TS using western blot and found that
treatment of HepG2-GRP78 cells with PP2 significantly
decreased TS expression as compared with that in cells
treated with DMSO. Moreover, treatment with PP2
significantly decreased the level of the ternary complex of
TS with FdUMP and CH2-THF (Figure 7g-7h).

DISCUSSION
Acquired resistance to 5-FU is a common
phenomenon and limits its clinical application in HCC.
Although the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon
have been the subject of intense investigation for many
years and several mechanisms of acquired resistance
to 5-FU have been proposed. Serval lines of evidence
have established the critical role of the LSF/TS axis in
the acquired resistance to 5-FU [17, 30, 31]. In this
manuscript, we demonstrated that GRP78 could confer
resistance to 5-FU by activating the c-Src/LSF/TS axis
in HCC, identifying the critical role of GRP78 in the
development of acquired resistance to 5-FU.Our results
proposed a new explanation for the acquired resistance to
5-FU in HCC and may provide a method to overcome this
phenomenon.
We have previously reported that GRP78 promoted
the invasion and metastasis of HCC [32-34]. In addition,
it maintains the viability of tumor cells and protects
them from death under adverse condition. GRP78 is also
involved in the resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs.

Inhibition of c-Src sensitizes HCC cells to 5-FU in
vitro and in vivo
To investigate whether inhibition of c-Src sensitizes
HCC cells to 5-FU, we knocked down c-Src expression in
HepG2-GRP78 cells using siRNA against c-Src (Figure
7a-7b). Cell viability analysis showed that knockdown

Our present studies demonstrated that GRP78 could
confer resistance to 5-FU in HCC. Cell viability analysis
using HepG2 cells overexpressing GRP78, delATPase
or delPBD indicated that overexpression of GRP78 or
its delPBD resulted in a pronounced resistance to 5-FU;
By contrast, HepG2 cells overexpressing delATPase
significantly increased the sensitivity of HepG2 cells
to 5-FU, demonstrating that GRP78 could cause the
resistance to 5-FU through its ATPase domain in HCC.
Resistance to 5-FU could be raised through
multiple mechanisms [35-37]. Many reports [30, 31]have
demonstrated the central role of the LSF/TS axis in the
development of 5-FU resistance. We found in this report
that over-expression of GRP78 up-regulates the LSF/TS
axis in HCC. Analysis of GRP78 and LSF expression in
clinical samples has demonstrated a positive correlation
between the expressions of these two proteins. In addition,
the expression levels of GRP78 or LSF also showed
a direct positive correlation to the stages and grades of
HCC. In cellular level, over-expression of GRP78 upregulates the expression of LSF and TS and promotes the
translocation of LSF from cytosol into nucleus. However,
knockdown of GRP78 down-regulates the expression of
LSF and TS. Overexpression of WT-GRP78 or delPBD

in HCC resulted in a significant increase in the expression
of LSF and TS. Finally, the resistance to 5-FU conferred
by GRP78 could be reverted by down-regulation of LSF
using siRNA.
In an attempt tried to identify GRP78 interacting
proteins. We found that GRP78 could interact directly with
c-Src, documented by Y2H hybrid and GST pulldown
assay. Indeed, the interaction between GRP78 and c-Src
was confirmed with anti-EGFP co-immunoprecipitation
and co-transfection of EGFP-tagged GRP78 and DsRedtagged c-Src. Further analysis demonstrated that the
interaction between GRP78 and c-Src is mediated by
the ATPase domain of GRP78. Moreover, we found that
GRP78 regulates the phosphorylation of c-Src through
its ATPase domain. Collectively, these findings indicated
that GRP78 could interact directly with c-Src and increase
the activity of c-Src, this results were consistent with the
works by other groups. It has been reported that c-Src
plays critical roles in the development of resistance
to many chemotherapeutic drugs including 5-FU and
inhibition of c-Src could revert the resistance to 5-FU in
pancreatic and colorectal cancers. We found that inhibition
of c-Src using PP2 and siRNA down-regulates the
expression of LSF and inhibited LSF translocation from

cytosol into nucleus in HCC. These data suggested that
c-Src is the mediator by which overexpression of GRP78
regulates the LSF/TS axis.
Finally, We found that inhibition of c-Src in
combination with 5-FU treatment resulted in almost
complete inhibition of cell growth both in HCC cells and
a mouse ectopic xenograft model, demonstrating that c-Src
plays a central role in the resistance to 5-FU conferred by
GRP78.
In summary, we have identified c-Src as a GRP78
downstream protein, when activated, c-Src increased
the expression of LSF and promoted the translocation of
LSF from cytosol into nucleus, which in turn elevated the
expression of TS, conferring the resistance to 5-FU. Our
findings provided the fact that inhibition of c-Src could
sensitized HCC cells to 5-FU, suggesting that it may be
exploited as an effective adjuvant therapy for HCC.

domain deleted mutants. Transfection was performed
according to lipofectamine2000’s instruction. Briefly,
Cells were cultured to 90% confluence in a six-well
plates and transfected with 4 μg plasmid using 16 μl
lipofectamine2000 (1:4 ratio). After 24h after transfection,
the transfection efficiency was observed using inverted
fluorescent microscope. Cells overexpressing GRP78 or
its mutant were selected in complete medium containing
400μg/ml G418 for 2-3 weeks and identified by western
blot using anti-GFP antibody. The plasmid used in this
experiment were as follows: pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-N1WT GRP78, pEGFP-N1-delATPase and pEGFP-N1delPBD. For observation of the cellular localization of
delATPase and delPBD mutants, HepG2 cells transfected
with pEGFP-N1-WT GRP78, pEGFP-N1-delATPase and
pEGFP-N1-delPBD were stained with TRITC-conjugated
ER tracker after 48h of transfection and the cellular
localization was observed with inverted microscope. For
co-transfection, Confluent cells were transfected with 4 μg
each recombinants. 20 μl lipofectamine2000 was used in
each transfection reaction. The plasmids we used in cotransfection were: pEGFP-N1-WT GRP78, pEGFP-N1delPBD, pEGFP-N1-delATPase and pDsRed-c-Src.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines QGY7703, SMMC7721, PLC, Hep3B, HepG2 and Malhavu
were purchased from the Type Culture Collection of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). All cell
lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS (Gibco, Life Technologies, USA) and
antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco, Life Technologies,
USA).5-FU was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO, USA).PP2 were the product of Selleck Chemicals
(Houston, TX, USA).

Western blot
Preparation of whole cell lysates and western
blot analysis was performed as described. The primary
antibodies used were anti-GRP78(sc-1050), antiactin(sc-1616), anti-LaminB(sc-6216)(1:1000, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, USA), anti-EGFP (1:1000,
Origene Rockville, USA, TA150052), anti-LSF
(1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK;ab180033), antiTS(ab7398), anti-ERK(ab17942), anti-p-ERK(ab47339),
anti-Akt(ab179463),
anti-p-Akt(ab38449)(1:1000,
Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-Gab1(#3232),anti-pGab1(#3233),anti-c-Src(#2123),
anti-p-c-Src(#6943)
((1:500, Cell signaling, Danver, USA). For analysis of the
translocation of LSF from cytosol to nucleus, the nuclear
extract and cytosol extract were isolated using NE-PER
nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce,
thermo fisher, France).

RNA interference
The siRNAs against GRP78 were synthesized by
Genechem Corporation (Shanghai, China). The sequences
of sense strands were as follow: GRP78 siRNA1:
5’-GGAGCGCAUUGAUACUAGAUU-3’;
GRP78
siRNA2:
5’-GACGCUGGAACUAUUGCUUU-3’.
siRNA against LSF and c-Src consisting of pools of three
to five target-specific 19-25 nt was purchased from Santa
Cruz. Transfections were performed in six-well plates
following Lipofectamine2000’s instructions. Cells were
transfected with 4μg of siRNAs. 10μl Lipofectamine2000
were used for each well. The control siRNA was also
purchased from Santa Cruz.

Human tissue specimens
All the surgery resected tissue samples were
obtained from the Department of Gastroenterology of
the General Hospital of Chinese Liberation Army. All the
studies related to these tissue samples were in compliance
with Helsinki Declaration. The differentiation extents were
re-evaluated by two pathologists. The clinicopathological
data were summarized in Table 1. It is worth to note that
none of these patients has received chemotherapy or
irradiation before surgery.

Transfection
HepG2 cells stably overexpressing GRP78
or its mutant were generated by transfection of
EGFP tagged WT-GRP78 or its ATPase or PBD

Immunohistochemistry

RT-PCR

Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously
reported. The dilution ratio of primary antibodies were
1:100. Antigen was retrieved by high pressure for 2
min in citrate buffer (0.01 M sodium citrate, pH 6.0).
All sections were examined and scored independently
by two investigators without any knowledge of the
clinicopathological data of the patients, at least 5 fields
were randomly chosen. The expression of Grp78 and LSF
were evaluated according to the ratio of positive cells and
staining intensity per field and scored as 0 for staining
less than 5%, 1 for staining of 5 to 10%, 2 for staining of
10 to 50%, 3 for staining >50%. Intensity was graded as
follows: 1, weak; and 2, strong staining. A total score of
0 to 6 was calculated and the scores were designated as
1(score: 0-1), 2 (2-4), and 3(5-6).

Conventional RT-PCR was performed as previously
reported. The primers we used were as follows:
LSF:
Forward
5’-AATTGCTCAGCTTTTCAGCA-3’;
Reverse
5’-CCCTCTGTGTGTACCACAA-3’.

Yeast two-hybrid screening
All vectors, yeast strains, reagents, and methods
were derived from the MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid
System (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA). PCR-generated
chickGRP78 full length was inserted into pGBKT7 inframe with the DNA binding domain of GAL4 at its
3’ end, to generate pGBKT7-GRP78. Screening was
performed using the GRP78-Gal4 DNA binding domain
fusion protein expressed from pGBKT7-GRP78 as the
bait. A human Fetal Liver cDNA Library was constructed
and screened according to the manual. Yeast AH109
was co-transformed with pGBKT7-GRP78, liver cancer
library cDNA, and linearized pGADT7-Rec, using a highefficiency lithium acetate/poly-ethylene glycol method.
Positive colonies were selected on SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/Trp/ plates and assayed for b-galactosidase activity.
Secondary screens were performed in a similar manner
to minimize false positives, and the bait was expelled
through saturation growth in SD-Leu. Positive interacting
colonies were recovered, sequenced, and matched to
known sequences using BLAST (National Centre for
Biotechnology Information, NCBI).To map the interacting
domains on GRP78 or SRC, different truncated GRP78s
and SRCs were inserted into pGBKT7 in-frame with the
DNA binding domain of GAL4 at its 3’end and pGADT7Rec respectively, then cotranfected into Yeast AH109 and
positive interactions were selected on SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/Trp/ plates and assayed for β-galactosidase activity.

Anti-EGFP immunoprecipitation
Cell lysates contain at least 1000 μg of protein
from each sample were pre-cleared with 50 μl of protein
A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and incubated with
5 μg of anti-EGFP antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK)
overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. The total volume of this
reaction was 1ml. Following antibody incubation, 100 μl
of protein A sepharose beads (50% slurry) were added and
rotated at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were then centrifuged at
12,000g for 5min and washed for 5 times with 1% NP40
lysis buffer. The precipitates were eluted by adding of 50
μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer (50 mm TrisHCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm DTT, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol
blue, 10% glycerol), followed by boiling at 100 °C for
5 min. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation was
resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western
blot analysis.

GST pulldown assay

Cell viability assay

Whole cell lysates were isolated as described
previously. The clarified whole cell lysates were incubated
with 50 μl of a 50 % slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B
(GE Healthcare, USA) and 25 μg GST for 1 h at 4 °C.
Resins bounded with GST-GRP78, GST-delPBD,GSTdelATPase or GST were incubated with whole cell lysates
containing 1 mg protein extract overnight at 4 °C on a
rotator. The resins were then washed 5 times with icecold lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted by adding 25 μl
of 2 × Laemmli sample buffer at 100 °C for 5 min and
centrifuged for 5 min at 12,000 g. The supernatant was
resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot
analysis using anti-c-Src (#2123, Cell signaling).

Cells were cultured at 5,000 cells per well in 96well tissue culture plates. After 24 h after plating, cells
were washed 3 times with PBS and then treated with the
5-FU for 72 hours in RPMI-1640 containing 0.5% FBS.
At the end of the culture period, cells were washed with
ice cold PBS, the MTT reagents were added according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and the absorbance
was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader.
Mean values were calculated from three independent
experiments. Cell viability is expressed as the ratio of the
absorbance of cells treated with 5-FU and that of cells
treated with DMSO. To investigate the chemosensitizing
effect of c-Src kinase inhibitors, 5-FU was applied to
cell culture following pretreatment with PP2 for 24 h,
