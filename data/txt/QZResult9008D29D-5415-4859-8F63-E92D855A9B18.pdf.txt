ABSTRACT
IKKa has been implicated as a key regulator of oncogenesis and driver of the
metastatic process; therefore is regarded as a promising therapeutic target in anticancer
drug development. In spite of the progress made in the development of IKK inhibitors,
no potent IKKa inhibitor(s) have been identified. Our multistep approach of molecular
modeling and direct binding has led to the identification of plant flavone apigenin as
a specific IKKa inhibitor. Here we report apigenin, in micro molar range, inhibits IKKa
kinase activity, demonstrates anti-proliferative and anti-invasive activities in functional
cell based assays and exhibits anticancer efficacy in experimental tumor model. We found
that apigenin directly binds with IKKa, attenuates IKKa kinase activity and suppresses
NF-ĸB/p65 activation in human prostate cancer PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells much more
effectively than IKK inhibitor, PS1145. We also showed that apigenin caused cell cycle
arrest similar to knockdown of IKKa in prostate cancer cells. Studies in xenograft mouse
model indicate that apigenin feeding suppresses tumor growth, lowers proliferation
and enhances apoptosis. These effects correlated with inhibition of p-IKKa, NF-ĸB/
p65, proliferating cell nuclear antigen and increase in cleaved caspase 3 expression in a
dose-dependent manner. Overall, our results suggest that inhibition of cell proliferation,
invasiveness and decrease in tumor growth by apigenin are mediated by its ability to
suppress IKKa and downstream targets affecting NF-ĸB signaling pathways.

leads to ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by
the proteasome, resulting in the nuclear translocation
of NF-ĸB (p65/p50), designated as the canonical
pathway [5–7]. An alternative pathway, regulated by
IKKα homodimers, induces processing of the precursor
p100  to  NF-ĸB2 (p52) to translocate with RelB to
the nucleus, leading to DNA binding and target gene
activation [5–7].

INTRODUCTION
The IĸB kinases IKKα and IKKβ are critical
in activating the NF-ĸB pathway [1, 2]. IKKα/β are
catalytic subunits of the heterotrimeric IKK complex
bound to the non-catalytic subunit IKKγ/Nemo [1–4].
IKKα/β phosphorylates amino terminal serine residues
in the IĸB family proteins. Phosphorylation of IĸB

Aberrant activation of IKKs, NF-ĸB subunits
and their regulated pathways have been implicated
in the pathogenesis of many neoplasms, including
prostate cancer [8–10]. Blocking IKK-mediated IĸBα
degradation and NF-ĸB activation, repression of NF-ĸB
transactivation potential and stabilization of IĸB has been
shown to inhibit aberrant gene expression, malignant
phenotypes and therapeutic resistance in pre-clinical
models of prostate cancer [11–14]. Previous studies
suggested that IKKβ subunit is essential for canonical
NF-ĸB activation through mediation of IĸB degradation,
leading to rapid development of IKKβ inhibitors [13, 14].
Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor that blocks IĸB
degradation and RelA activation, and BS345541, an
inhibitor of IKKβ kinase activity have been evaluated
in the management of prostate cancer [15, 16]. Clinical
trials using bortezomib alone in advanced stage prostate
cancer and in combination with androgen blockade and
chemotherapy showed limited clinical efficacy due to
incomplete targeting of NF-ĸB/Rel subunits and other
signaling pathways mediated through androgen receptor
and β-catenin, which contribute to the resistance to
bortezomib and castration in prostate cancer [17, 18].
Another recent study showed proteasome inhibition
by bortezomib increases IL-8 expression and nuclear
accumulation of IKKα [19]. Together, these findings
suggest that drugs targeting IKKβ-mediated activation of
NF-ĸB alone are insufficient. It has been hypothesized
that IKKα may contribute to canonical and/or alternative
NF-ĸB/Rel activation and promotion of malignant
phenotype. The few previous studies on IKKα in prostate
cancer have emphasized its potential role in controlling
invasiveness and metastasis in IKKAA/AA/TRAMP
mice  [20,  21]. These studies emphasize that IKKα
alone is sufficient to contribute to activation of NF-ĸB
pathways, promoting a malignant phenotype and suggest
that these mechanisms may be important therapeutic
target in treating prostate cancer. In recent years, there
has been considerable study of the functions of plant
flavonoids in inhibition of the NF-ĸB pathway [22–25].
A better understanding of the target specificity and dosage
required for inhibition of NF-ĸB signaling through IKK
inhibitors may lead to the development of more specific
and efficacious inhibitors of NF-ĸB signaling.
Apigenin (4′, 5, 7-trihydroxyflavone) is an important
component of fruit and vegetable-rich human diets
[26,  27]. Apigenin inhibits proliferation in several
types of cancer cells and induces apoptosis [28–30].
Apigenin has been shown to suppress cytokine-induced
NF-ĸB activation and cancer progression by blocking
IKKβ activity [31]. Apigenin has also been shown to
inactivate NF-ĸB through suppression of p65/RelA
phosphorylation at Ser536 [32]. We have previously
shown that apigenin suppresses constitutive and TNFαinduced NF-ĸB activation in human prostate cancer cells,
which in turn block the downstream signaling related to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer progression [33]. Apigenin intake by transgenic
adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice
inhibits prostate carcinogenesis and completely blocks
tumor metastasis [34]. Consistent with the identification
of IKKα as a therapeutic target and its involvement in
prostate cancer, we hypothesized that suppression of IKKα
kinase activation affecting downstream NF-ĸB signaling
by apigenin might markedly reduce cancer progression.
Therefore, we studied the molecular basis of the effect
of apigenin on IKKα and IKKβ inhibition using human
prostate cancer cell lines and in an athymic nude mouse
xenograft model.

RESULTS
Aberrant expression and phosphorylation of
IKKα and IKKβ in human prostate cancer
specimens and cell lines
IKKα and IKKβ have 52% amino acid identity
with a similar structural organization, which includes
kinases, leucine zipper, and helix-loop-helix domains
(Supplemental Figure 1). The kinase domains of those
proteins contain MAP kinase activation loop with closely
spaced serine residues at position 176 and 180 in IKKα
and positions 177 and 181 in IKKβ. Phosphorylation of
these serine residues by upstream kinases viz. MEKK1 and
NIK activates IKK kinase activity [8–10]. To extend these
observations we determined IKKα and IKKβ expression,
their phosphorylation and localization in 10 clinical
prostate cancer specimens (Gleason score 3 + 3 and 3 + 4)
and matched benign tissue from same patients by Western
blot analysis. As shown in Figure 1A, the total protein
levels of IKKα and IKKβ were detected both in prostate
cancer and benign specimens. A modest increase in IKKα
and IKKβ expression was observed in cancer specimens
compared to benign tissue. The phosphorylated levels of
IKKα/β as p-IKKβ (Ser177) as upper band and p-IKKα
(Ser176) as lower band was observed in these specimens.
Densitometric analysis demonstrated 1.99-fold increase in
p-IKKα and 1.86-fold increase in p-IKKβ levels in cancer
tissue compared to benign tissue (Figure 1B).
Next we examined p-IKKα/β expression by
immunochemical staining of paraffin-embedded
sections  of 24 prostate cancer specimens consisting of
14  low-grade tumor (Gleason score 5–6), 10 mediangrade tumor (Gleason score 7–8) and 6 benign tissues
(Figure  1C). The staining intensity and localization of
p-IKK in tumor tissue was assessed by light microscopy.
Over 90% of p-IKKα/β was detected both in the nucleus
and in the cytoplasm of malignant cells and was more
intense in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, phosphorylated
form of IKKα/β was distributed both in the nuclear and
cytosolic fractions of 4 human prostate cancer cells, where
22Rv1 and PC-3 cells exhibited high p-IKKα/β expression
in the nuclear fraction as well as in the cytosol, compared

56.8% in control cells. Similarly, knockdown of IKKβ
in both cell lines resulted in S-phase arrest of the cell
cycle; PC-3 cells (86.2% versus 26.8%) and 22Rv1 cells
(77.2% versus 25.5%) compared to their corresponding
controls (Figure 2A & 2B). Together these results provide
evidence that IKK are oncogenic and regulate proliferation
in prostate cancer cells.

These findings suggest that IKK kinases are constitutively
active in prostate cancer cells and clinical prostate cancer
specimens, compared to benign tissue.

Apigenin blocks catalytic site of IKKα and
IKKβ-In silico molecular modeling

To determine the relevance of endogenous IKKα/β
activation in cancer cell proliferation, we knockdown
IKKα and IKKβ in human prostate cancer PC-3 and 22Rv1
cells using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) approach. IKKα
and IKKβ expression was significantly downregulated
by the use of IKKα and IKKβ shRNA2, whereas no
significant change in IKKα and IKKβ was observed by
scrambled shRNA or use of transfection reagent alone in
both cell lines (Supplemental Figure 3). Knockdown of
IKKα in PC-3 cells resulted in significant accumulation
of cells in the G1 phase (71.8%) compared to 52.1% in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Our previous studies demonstrate that apigenin
suppresses constitutive and TNFα-induced NF-ĸB
activation in human prostate cancer cells [33]. Therefore
we hypothesized that apigenin might regulate NF-ĸB
activation by blocking IKK activity. We performed
in silico docking studies with apigenin and PS1145,
an IKK inhibitor to determine their effectiveness in
suppressing kinase activity. Docking results show that

both apigenin and PS1145 were docked to the deep cleft in
the structure of IKKα (Figure 3A). Docked conformation
of apigenin exhibit two fused aromatic rings toward the
base of the pocket while the other aromatic ring protruding
outwards (Figure 3A-a). Inside the pocket, apigenin is
anchored by two hydrogen bonds – one between side chain
of Asp165 and one of the hydroxyl groups in the buried
phenyl ring; second between carbonyl oxygen in apigenin
and backbone of Cys98. Two dimensional representation
of interaction of apigenin with different amino acid
residues in the pockets is shown in (Figure 3A-c). PS1145
was docked in the pocket of IKKα in similar mode as of
apigenin. The docked conformation of PS1145 showed
chlorine substituted ring buried deep inside the pocket
of IKKα (Figure 3A-b). As in case of apigenin, hydrogen
bond interaction of the ligand with carboxylic side chain
of Asp165 has been observed. In addition, two other
hydrogen bonds between ligand and protein stabilize the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

interaction between the two molecules. Nitrogen atoms in
the two 6-membered rings form hydrogen bonds with delta
oxygen of Asn149 and backbone of Gly101 (Figure 3A-d).
Next we performed in silico docking with IKKβ.
Docking results show that both apigenin and PS1145
were docked to the deep cleft in the structure of IKKβ.
Figure 3B show docked conformation of both the ligands
into the pocket of IKKβ. It has been observed that apigenin
is well anchored by hydrogen bonds with amino acid
resides in the protein from both ends. All three hydroxyl
groups in apigenin have been observed to be favorably
oriented around different hydrogen bond acceptor atoms in
the protein (Figure 3B-a). Two hydroxyl groups in one of
the phenyl ring participate in hydrogen bonding with main
chain atoms of Thr20 and Gly24. The single hydroxyl
group in another phenyl ring interacts with backbone of
Glu94 via hydrogen bond (Figure 3B-c). In case of PS1145
docking to IKKβ, three hydrogen bonded interaction have

resulted in 96.4% to  81.6% and in 22Rv1 cells 99% to
91% decrease in IKKβ phosphorylation; whereas PS1145
treatment of PC-3 cells resulted in 95.9% to 78.9% and 98%
to 90% in 22Rv1 cells at similar doses ranging from 2.5 to
20 μM. Taken together, these results suggest that IKKα is
preferential target of apigenin which has higher potential to
inhibit IKKα phosphorylation than IKKβ.

the pocket of the protein (Figure 3B-b). Hydrogen bond
is formed between carbonyl oxygen in ligand with main
chain oxygen of Asp100. Further, backbone of Leu18 and
Cys98 forms hydrogen bonds with two different nitrogen
atoms of the ligand (Figure 3B-d). Overall, the program
predicted superior binding ability of apigenin with IKK
kinases, compared to PS1145. These predicted results
were validated with the experimental data.

IKKβ-Ex vivo study

Apigenin inhibits IKKα and IKKβ
phosphorylation in prostate cancer cells

Next we determined whether the inhibition of IKKα
and IKKβ phosphorylation by apigenin was due to direct
interaction, we investigated binding of apigenin to IKKα
and IKKβ in ex vivo approach using sepharose B beads
(Figure 5A & 5B). As a positive control, IKKα and IKKβ
was detected in high levels in the cell lysates obtained
from PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells (Lane 1) but was not detected
in sepharose B beads alone (Lane 2). An increased binding
of IKKα was observed in sepharose B-apigenin coupled
beads (Lane 3) in both PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells whereas
modest binding was observed for IKKβ with apigenin.
Experiment performed with PS1145 demonstrate increased
binding of IKKβ with sepharose B-PS1145-coupled beads,
whereas no significant affinity binding was noted for
IKKα with PS1145 in both cell lines (Lane 4). These data
demonstrate that apigenin interacts with cellular IKKα
with higher affinity than IKKβ.

Next we determined the effect of apigenin and PS1145
on phosphorylation of IKKα (Ser176/180) and IKKβ
(Ser177/181) in prostate cancer PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells using
Pathscan® ELISA assay. As shown in Figure 4A & 4B, a
dose dependent decrease in IKKα phosphorylation by
apigenin which was more pronounced than PS1145 in
both cell lines. Treatment with 2.5 to 20  μM apigenin

and in 22Rv1 cells 96.2% to 72.4% decrease in IKKα
phosphorylation. Similarly, PS1145 treatment at similar
doses in PC-3 cells resulted in 98.0% to 83% and in 22Rv1
cells 97.1% to 88.3% decrease in IKK phosphorylation. The
effect of apigenin in the inhibition of IKKβ phosphorylation
was similar to that of PS1145 in both cell lines. Treatment

p-IKKα than p-IKKβ. Similar effects were observed upon
treatment of cells with 20 μM apigenin in time-dependent
fashion where decrease in IKKα/β phosphorylation was
observed at 4, 8 and 16 h, respectively. No significant
change in the levels of IKKβ was observed in these cell
lines. Furthermore, apigenin treatment resulted in marked
inhibition of NF-ĸB/p65 protein expression in dose- and
time- dependent manner in both cell lines.

Next we determined the inhibitory effect of apigenin
on IKKα and IKKβ and their phosphorylation. As shown
in Figure 6A & 6B, treatment of PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells
with 2.5, 5, 10 and 20 μM doses of apigenin for 16 h
resulted in significant decrease in IKKα and p-IKKα/β in

suggest that apigenin perturbs cell cycle progression of
prostate cancer cells.

We also determined the effect of apigenin on
cytosolic and nuclear changes in IKKα/β phosphorylation
in PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells. As shown in Figure 7A & 7B,
apigenin treatment significantly suppressed phosphor­
ylation of IKKα in the nuclear fraction, compared to
untreated group in both cell lines. These events resulted
in increased p-IKKα expression in the cytosol after
apigenin treatment. No significant effect was observed on
the protein levels of IKKα and IKKβ and p-IKKβ after
apigenin treatment in the nucleus and the cytosol.

Apigenin suppresses migration in prostate
cancer cells
Next, we determined the effects of apigenin on
migration of human prostate cancer PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells
by means of wound-healing assay. As shown in Figure 8B,
wound-healing assay demonstrated that apigenin
diminished migration of human prostate cancer cells.
Treatment of PC-3 cells with 10 μM and 20 μM apigenin
for 6 h resulted in 62% and 71% of open wound area,
compared to untreated cells (49%); whereas 16 h apigenin
treatment at similar doses resulted in 21% and 29% open
wound area, compared to 5% in untreated cells. Similarly
in 22Rv1 cells, 78% and 89% of open wound area was
observed in 10 μM and 20 μM apigenin, compared to 66%
in untreated cells at 6 h; whereas apigenin treatment at
similar doses resulted in 44% and 59% open wound area,
compared to 21% in untreated cells after scratching.

Apigenin causes cell cycle arrest in prostate
cancer cells
Next we determined whether apigenin-mediated
decrease in IKKα phosphorylation causes perturbation in
cell cycle and proliferation in cancer cells. We ascertained
the effect of apigenin on the cell cycle. The cells were
synchronized by serum deprivation for 36 h and later
incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum with varying
concentrations of apigenin for 16 h. Compared with the
untreated controls, apigenin treatment resulted in an
appreciable arrest of PC-3 cells in G0-G1 phase of cell cycle
after 16 h of the treatment. The treatment caused an arrest
of 59% cells in G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle at 10 μM
concentration that further increased to 65% at 20 μM in
these cells, compared with vehicle-treated control (51%).
This increase in G0-G1 cell population was accompanied
with a concomitant decrease of cell number in S phase and
G2-M phase of the cell cycle. Similarly, apigenin treatment
to 22Rv1 cells caused an arrest of 58% cells in G0-G1
phase of the cell cycle at 10 μM concentration that further
increased to 61% at 20 μM in these cells, compared with
vehicle-treated control (55%) (Figure 8A). These results

Apigenin has been shown to be effective in cell

determine whether these events occur in vivo using

at 20 and 50 μg/mouse/day through gavage, initiating
2 weeks after cell inoculation and continuing for 8 weeks.

In this experimental protocol, intake of apigenin inhibited
the growth of tumor xenograft at both doses of apigenin.
As shown in Supplemental Figure 4A, PC-3 tumor volume
was inhibited by 32% and 51% (P < 0.005 and 0.0001) and
the wet weight of tumor was decreased by 28% and 40%
(P < 0.001) after 20 and 50 μg/day apigenin, respectively, at
the termination of the experiment. Similarly, apigenin intake
resulted in 40% and 53% (P < 0.05 and 0.002) decrease in
22Rv1 tumor volume and the wet weight was decreased
by 29% and 42% (P < 0.001) (Supplemental Figure 4B).
Apigenin treatment also resulted in significant enhancement
of apoptosis as measured by M30 reactivity in tumor lysates
from PC-3 and 22Rv1 (Supplemental Figure 5A & 5B).

Furthermore, apigenin intake by these mice did not seem
to induce any adverse effects as judged by monitoring

DISCUSSION

expansion of epithelial progenitors responsible for
prostate regeneration as well as in tumor recurrence [43].
We performed cell cycle analysis after knockdown of
IKKα by shRNA. Our studies demonstrate an arrest of
prostate cancer cells in G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle, in
comparison to a control group, which was similar to the
effect elicited after exposure of cancer cells to apigenin.
These studies highlight the importance of IKKα in
oncogenesis and further suggest that the tumor promotion
and tumor suppressor activity of IKKα might be cell type
specific. However, further investigation is needed in this
area of research.
IKKα/β are essential regulators of the NF-ĸB
pathway [5–7]. Although IKKα is not significantly
involved in the phosphorylation of IĸBα resulting in
its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the
proteasome, it contributes to NF-ĸB activation through
an unknown mechanism. Studies have shown that IKKα
can phosphorylate IKKβ, which may have enhancing
effects on NF-ĸB activation [44]. Our data presented in
clinical prostate specimens demonstrate that both p-IKKα
and p-IKKβ levels were higher in cancer specimens,
which may contribute to NF-ĸB activation during cancer
progression. Furthermore, our studies with apigenin
have shown preferential binding and its effect on IKKα
activation is more pronounced than IKKβ. Thus this dual
inhibition of IKKα/β by apigenin would appear to be an
optimal approach to block NF-ĸB activity. More detailed
studies are warranted to identify the related molecular
mechanisms responsible for this effect. Accumulating
evidence suggests that the cellular effects of apigenin
may be mediated by their interactions with specific
proteins central to intracellular signaling cascades [45].
Apigenin has been shown to interact with a number
of proteins  kinases to regulate multiple cell signaling
pathways [46–48].
Although our studies focused on IKK as an
important target for apigenin, there are some other
possible mechanisms of apigenin effects on tumor growth
inhibition. Studies from our group and others have shown
that the effects of apigenin are mediated by different
pathways, such as focal adhesion kinase/Src signaling,
the PI3K/Akt pathway, β-catenin/c-myc, estrogen
receptor and others [48–52]. We have demonstrated that
apigenin preferentially accumulates in the nuclear matrix
and binds to nucleic acid base, endorsing its antioxidant
function [53]. Recent study show that apigenin binds to
heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2 and then
modulates the activity of a large number of downstream
cellular genes [54]. Accumulated evidence leads us to
hypothesize that there is some distinct mechanism by
which apigenin suppresses prostate cancer growth, and
we believe this warrants further investigation.
In summary, our findings present evidence that
apigenin inhibits IKKα-mediated NF-ĸB activation in
prostate cancer. Moreover, apigenin intake effectively

In this study, we present several lines of evidence
that IKKα plays an important role in cancer progression
and that apigenin specifically blocks IKKα activation,
leading to decreased proliferation and enhanced apoptosis
in prostate cancer cells. First we show that constitutive
IKKα levels and its activity is higher in cancer specimens
compared to benign counterparts. Second we demonstrate
that stable knockdown of IKKα causes G0-G1 phase cell
cycle arrest. Third, our data indicate that apigenin directly
binds to IKKα, inhibiting its kinase activity. Finally, we
demonstrate that apigenin suppresses IKK and NF-ĸB
activation, thereby causing reduced proliferation and
induction of apoptosis in cell culture and in an in vivo
tumor xenograft model.
In recent years cancer researchers have become
increasingly interested in developing IKK inhibitors
that work on various modes in the NF-ĸB signaling
pathway [35–37]. After it was shown that IKKβ is more
critical than IKKα in activating the NF-ĸB pathway, a
number of chemical entities that commonly function as
IKKβ selective inhibitors were developed and tested for
anti-cancer efficacy [38, 39]. Although these molecules
were efficient in suppressing inflammatory diseases,
their usefulness as anticancer agents was limited, and
it became clear that they lacked activity against IKKα.
Recent studies have elucidated the unique role of IKKα
in the activation of the alternative NF-ĸB pathways and
have demonstrated that IKKα is a driver of the metastatic
process [20, 21]. These studies imply that IKKα might be
an attractive target for anticancer therapy. Given the role
for IKKα-mediated NF-ĸB signaling in tumorigenesis and
the IKKα activation in prostate cancer we provide in vitro
experimental evidence that apigenin specifically binds
with IKKα with higher affinity than IKKβ and blocks
IKKα activation, which correlated with reduced migration
of cancer cells treated with apigenin. Further research
work is needed to investigate how apigenin-mediated
IKKα inhibition affects downstream mechanisms involved
in the process of metastasis.
Although studies have shown that IKKα plays a
major role in tumor cell invasiveness and metastasis, its
role in oncogenesis is controversial. Some studies highlight
IKKα as a tumor suppressor rather a tumor promoter
gene. Kwak et al. have shown that cells lacking IKKα
show nuclear cyclin D1 overexpression and a neoplastic
phenotype [40]; whereas increase in IKKα expression
suppresses tumor progression and improves prognosis in
nasopharyngeal carcinoma [41]. On the contrary, studies
by Karin and colleagues have demonstrated that IKKα
regulates mammary epithelial proliferation [42], and
mutation-preventing IKKα activation inhibits metastasis
in IKKAA/AA/TRAMP mice, a transgenic mouse model of
prostate cancer [21]. Furthermore, Ammirante et al. have
shown the requirement of IKKα for androgen-dependent

nude mouse model. These results suggest that suppression
of IKKα/β activation by apigenin may be a useful strategy
in the prevention and/or treatment of prostate cancer.

Transductions were carried out in RPMI containing 10%
FBS complete medium and cells were incubate 48  h
supplemented with polybrene (4 μg/ml). After 48 h stably
transduced population were selected in 0.5–1 μg/ml
puromycin for 2 week. To maintain authenticity of the
stable cell lines, the cells were always maintained in the
presence of selection agent and the cells were used after
15–20 passage.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and treatments

Docking of ligands to IKKα and IKKβ proteins

Human prostate cancer PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells
obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA) were used in the study. These cell
lines possess high constitutive IKK activity. The cells
were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 2.05 mM
L-glutamine (Lonza Walkersville, MD) with 10%
fetal bovine serum, respectively, supplemented with
1% penicillin and streptomycin in a humidified incubator
at 37°C with an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For experimental
studies, these cells were grown to 70% confluence in
monolayer and treated with apigenin at concentration
ranging from 2.5 to 20 μM obtained from Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO (Cat# A3145; >97% purity) for 4–16 h in
dimethyl sulfoxide as vehicle. The final concentration of
the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide did not exceed 0.1% in all
the treatments.

Three dimensional structural models of IKK
proteins were built by homology modeling using Modeller
9v8. Crystal structures of calcium-dependent protein
kinase domain from Toxoplasma gondii (PDB ID 3IS5)
and protein kinase A from Bos taurus (PDB ID 1Q61)
were used as templates for modeling IKKα and IKKβ,
respectively. These modeled structures were subsequently
used for protein-ligand docking studies. A receptor energy
grid was generated around the ATP-binding pocket of the
two proteins using Glide (Schrodinger, LLC). Coordinates
for apigenin were extracted from its co-crystal structure
with a different protein (PDB ID 3CF9). For PS1145,
coordinates were downloaded from PubChem database
(ID#16219884). The geometry of these compounds
were optimized by energy minimization using Maestro
(Schrodinger, LLC). LigPrep (Schrodinger, LLC) was
used to assign appropriate charges and add hydrogen
atoms to the ligand. Both of ligands were individually
docked into the pocket of IKKα and IKKβ using Glide
(Schrodinger, LLC) in XP (extra precision) mode.

Human prostate tissue specimens
Both benign and prostate cancer tissue and paraffinembedded block sections of human prostate cancer
were obtained from the Tissue Procurement Facility
of University Hospitals Case Medical Center and the
Midwestern Division of the Cooperative Human Tissue
Network. No consent was obtained for these discarded
tissues per their hospital policies and Institutional Review
Board protocols. These studies were approved by the
Institutional Review Board at the University Hospitals
Case Medical Center. Patients from whom these tissues
were procured had undergone surgical procedures for
prostatic disease and had not received any form of adjuvant
therapy. The Gleason grade and score of adenocarcinoma
in tissue specimens were assigned by a surgical pathologist
experienced in genitourinary pathology. Immediately after
procurement, samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at −80°C in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen
until further use.

Quantitative determination of IKKα and IKKβ
activity by ELISA
IKKα and IKKβ kinase activity was determined
using PathScan® Phospho-IKKα (Ser176/180) Sandwich
ELISA Kit (Cat #7073) and PathScan® Phospho-IKKβ
(Ser177/181) Sandwich ELISA Kit (Cat #7080) following
vendor’s protocol. Briefly, adherent cells approximately
70–80% confluent, were washed with ice-cold 1X PBS.
Cells lysed by adding, lysis buffer containing 1 mM
PMSF and incubated on ice for 5 min. Later cells were
scraped off and sonicated on ice, and centrifuged for
10 min at 12,000 g at 4°C. The supernatant was collected
and 50 μl of cell lysate was added to the appropriate well,
incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed
4 times with 1X wash buffer followed by incubation with
antibody and detection reagent followed by at 425 nm on
a spectrophotometer.

Transfection and generation of stable cell lines
Human prostate cancer PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells were
transduced by IKKα and IKKβ shRNA retroviral particles,
which is a pool of viral particle containing 3 target specific
constructs and one scrambled and one with negative
shRNA that encode 19–25 nt (plus hairpin) designed to
knockdown gene expression (OriGene Technologies, Inc.,
Rockville, MD) following vendor’s protocol. Briefly, cells
were plated in a 6 well plates 24 h prior to viral infection.

at 600 g for 5 min and again suspended in 500 μl
PBS and incubated with 5 ml RNase (20 μg/ml final
concentration) for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were chilled

of coupling buffer and then centrifuged at 1000 rpm for
3 min at 4°C. Precipitate was resuspended in 5 volumes of
0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) with 2 h rotation at room
temperature. After washing three times with 0.1 M acetate
buffer (pH 4.0) containing 0.5 M NaCl, and finally mixture
was washed with 0.5 M containing NaCl in 0.1 M TrisHCl (pH 8.0) buffer. Lysates from PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells
(500 μg) was incubated at 4°C overnight with sepharose
4B beads or sepharose 4B-apigenin coupled beads
(100  ml, 50% slurry) in a reaction buffer [50 mM Tris
(pH 7.5), 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01%
Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml BSA, 0.02 mM PMSF, and 1 mg
protease inhibitor cocktail]. The beads were then washed
5 times with 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5) buffer containing 5 mM
EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.02% Nonidet P-40,
and 0.02 mM PMSF. Whole cell lysate (input control),
lysates with sepharose 4B beads alone (negative control)
or with sepharose 4B-apigenin coupled beads were applied
to SDS-PAGE, and detected with antibody against IKKα
and IKKβ, respectively, after transferring to membrane.

Wound healing migration assay
Cell migration was determined by means of woundhealing assay as previously described [55]. Cells were
seeded into six-well plates and grown overnight. Then the
cells were serum starved for 24 h. A sterile 200 μl pipette
tip was used to scratch the cells to form a wound. The cells
were washed with PBS and cultured in 10% fetal bovine
serum medium with apigenin for 6 h and 16 h. Migration
of the cells to the wound was visualized with an inverted
Olympus phase-contrast microscope. The representative
fields were photographed. The healing rate was quantified
with measurements of the gap size after the culture using
Image J software.

Western blot analysis
Excised tumor tissues from xenograft implant and
cells from treated and control groups were subjected
to preparation of total lysate and isolation of cytosolic
and nuclear fractions as described previously [34, 46].
For Western blotting, 25 μg of protein was resolved
over 4–20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel and then
transferred onto the nitrocellulose membrane. The blots
were blocked using 5% non-fat dry milk and probed using
appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. The
membrane was then incubated with appropriate secondary
antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by detection
using chemiluminescence ECL kit (GE  Healthcare
Biosciences). For equal loading of proteins, the membrane
was probed with appropriate loading controls. The
antibodies used were anti-IKKα (Cat#2682), anti-IKKβ
(Cat#2678), anti-p-IKKα/β (Cat#2697), anti-cleaved
caspase-3 (Cat#9661) and anti-histone H4 (Cat#2592)
from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA. AntiNF-ĸB/p65 (sc-8008), anti-PCNA (sc-56), anti-β-Actin
(sc-47778) and anti-CK18 (sc-28264) were purchased
from Santa Cruz. Densitometric measurement of the
bands in Western blot analysis was performed using
digitalized scientific software program using Kodak
2000R imaging system.

Tumor xenograft study
The animal experiment was conducted in accordance
with the guidelines established by the University’s
Animal Research Committee and with the NIH
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Approximately 1 million PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells suspended
in 0.05 ml medium and mixed with 0.05 ml matrigel were
subcutaneously injected in the left and right flank of each
mouse to initiate tumor growth. After implantation, the
animals were kept under supervision for growth of tumor.
Two weeks after cell inoculation, animals were divided
into three equal groups of six mice each. Apigenin (10 mg)
was suspended in 1 ml vehicle material (0.5% methyl
cellulose and 0.025% Tween 20) by sonication for 30 s
at 4°C and further diluted for appropriate concentration.
Apigenin, 20 and 50 μg/mouse/day was administered
by gavage in 0.2 ml of a vehicle, daily for 8 weeks
throughout the study. These doses are comparable to the
daily consumption of flavonoid in humans as reported in
previously published studies [34, 46].

Cell cycle analysis

Apoptosis by ELISA

Cells (70% confluent) were starved for 36 h to
arrest them in G1 phase of the cell cycle, after which
they were treated with 10 μM and 20 μM apigenin in
RPMI 1640 complete media for 16 h. After treatment
cells were collected, washed twice with chilled

Apoptosis was assessed by M30-Apoptosense™
ELISA kit (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol and color
developed was read at 450-nm against the blank and
values were expressed as fold change.

Statistical analysis
The difference of relative density, kinase activity,
IKKα/β phosphorylation and proliferation index between
two groups was compared using T-test or paired T-test
(for matched samples). For tumor volume and body
weight, their trends over time were visualized by scatter
plot (using mean ± SD against time, where SD stands for
Standard Deviation of the Mean). The difference of tumor
volume (mm3) and body weight, measured at the end of
experiment (8 weeks after implantation of tumor), among
three treatment groups (control, 20 μg and 50 μg apigenin)
was examined using analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by Turkey multiple comparison procedure.
All tests are two-tailed and p-value less than 0.05 are
considered to be statistically significant.
