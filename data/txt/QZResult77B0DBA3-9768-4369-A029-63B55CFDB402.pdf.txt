ABSTRACT:
The p53-Mdm2 feedback loop is thought to be the main mechanism by which
p53 autoregulates its levels and activity after DNA damage. We tested this paradigm
in a genetically engineered mouse model in which the feedback loop was disrupted
by point mutations in the p53 binding site of the Mdm2 promoter. We noted that
while the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop is required to regulate p53 activity especially
in the hematopoietic system in response to DNA damage, its role in development
and in regulating the stability of p53 is dispensable. In the present study we have
extended our characterization of this mouse model and show that the kinetics of p53
degradation is also unchanged in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Additionally,
MG132 experiments indicate that other E3-ligases regulate p53 stability. Also, Mdm4
cooperates in inhibition of p53 activity and levels in these mice. Finally, we show in
this system that enhanced acute p53 response does not promote aging or protect
against late term tumorigenesis. We also discuss future perspectives for this study.

INTRODUCTION

promotes Mdm2 transcription while the translated Mdm2
protein inhibits p53 functions. Since its discovery in the
early 90’s, the feedback loop is considered the major
pathway necessary for regulating the post-stress levels and
activity of p53 in a cell [6, 11-13]. Evidence in support of
this idea is derived mostly from correlative studies which
present an inverse correlation between Mdm2 abundance
and levels/activity of the p53 protein. We recently
generated a mouse model to address the importance of
the feedback loop and reported that while the feedback
loop is required to regulate p53 activity, especially in the
hematopoietic system after DNA damage, its role during
development and in regulating p53 stability is dispensable
[14]. However, questions remained in terms of the role of
the feedback loop in regulating p53 half-life and the role
of Mdm4 in Mdm2-mediated p53 degradation. Here we
have addressed these questions by further characterization
of cells and tissues from these mice. We show that in the
absence of DNA damage p53 half-life remains similar
between Mdm2+/+ and Mdm2P2/P2 MEF cells. However,
after DNA damage p53 degradation is delayed in Mdm2P2/
P2
cells. In addition, Mdm4 contributes towards inhibition
of p53 activity and stability.

The “Guardian of the genome” and tumor
suppressor, p53 induces cell cycle arrest, senescence or
apoptosis in cells that have experienced DNA damage
following genotoxic insults [1]. This genoprotective
function of p53 necessitates its level and activity be tightly
regulated in cells under both homeostatic and post-DNA
damage conditions. A range of p53 regulators have been
identified for this function [2]. However, elegant genetic
studies thus far have confirmed only Mdm2 and Mdm4 as
the major regulators of p53 [3-5]. These two homologous
proteins directly bind p53 through their N-terminal
domains and inhibit p53 transcriptional activity. In
addition, Mdm2 encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53
and promotes its degradation via the 26S proteosome
machinery [6-8]. Interestingly, Mdm2 in itself is a
transcriptional target of p53. The P2-promoter of Mdm2
carries two distinct p53 response elements wherein stress
induced p53 binds and promotes transcription of Mdm2
from this alternative promoter [9, 10]. This dynamic
relationship between the two proteins thus results in
a feedback loop in which DNA damage-activated p53

Mdm2P2/P2 genotypes. Finally, we tested doxorubicin as
an inducer of p53 stability in these MEFs (Figure 1C).
Genotoxic stress created by Doxorubicin exposure also
stabilized p53 similarly in both genotypes. Absence of
Mdm2 leads to spontaneous stabilization of mutant and
wild-type p53 [16, 20]. However, we did not observe
p53 stabilization in untreated cells in these experiments.
This indicates that absence of the feedback loop in itself
does not constitute a stress signal to induce wild-type p53
stabilization. Overall these experiments indicated that p53
stabilization in response to various stress signals is intact
in feedback deficient MEFs.

phenotypic

We introduced point mutations in the two p53
binding sites at the Mdm2 P2 promoter [14]. These
targeted alterations were specifically designed to inhibit
binding of stress induced p53 to the Mdm2 promoter and
thus abrogate the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop. Analysis
of the mutant Mdm2 P2 promoter sequence against the
TRANSFAC database (www.gene-regulation.com)
confirmed that no inadvertent novel transcription factor
binding sites were created. A targeting vector with the
mutant Mdm2 P2-promoter was used for generating the
Mdm2P2/P2 knock-in allele. To our surprise, even in the
absence of p53 autoregulation, homozygous Mdm2P2/P2
mice were born in normal Mendelian ratios and developed
normally [14]. In contrast, previous studies have shown
that mice which completely lack Mdm2 are embryo lethal
and die due to increased p53 activity [3, 4]. In addition,
mice with reduced Mdm2 expression exhibit increased
p53 activity which manifests many different phenotypic
alterations such as hyperpigmentation of skin, kinky tail,
small size, lymphopenia etc [15, 16]. However, Mdm2P2/P2
mice did not exhibit any such phenotypic anomalies and
survived till adulthood suggesting normal levels of p53
activity (data not shown). While p53 activation is well
documented during embryonic development [17, 18], our
studies indicate that the feedback loop is dispensable and
that basal Mdm2 levels (from P1 promoter) are sufficient
to regulate p53 activity.

Role of p53-dependent Mdm2 in p53 degradation
Mdm2 is the most important E3 ubiquitin ligase for
p53 [6-8]. Therefore, we tested whether the pattern and
kinetics of p53 degradation were altered in the absence
of the feedback loop. We treated early passage Mdm2+/+

p53 stabilization in response to stress stimuli in
feedback loop deficient MEFs
We had previously examined p53 stabilization in
Mdm2+/+ and Mdm2P2/P2 mouse tissues after exposure to
sublethal doses of ionizing radiation (IR) [14]. Similar
levels of p53 stabilization were observed in various tissues
of both genotypes, although the levels were slightly higher
in Mdm2P2/P2 mice. Here we extended this evaluation to
early passage mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from
Mdm2+/+ and Mdm2P2/P2 mice in response to other types
of stress stimuli which have been described for p53
stabilization. First, we irradiated Mdm2+/+ and Mdm2P2/
P2
MEFs with 6 Gy IR and harvested them at different
time points to assess p53 stability (Figure 1A). p53 was
similarly stabilized in both genotypes and remained
stable for the 10 hour duration of the experiment. Next,
we tested p53 stability after exposure to Actinomycin
D, an inhibitor that mimics ribosomal stress conditions
(Figure 1B) [19]. Again, similar levels and duration of
p53 stabilization were observed in MEFs of Mdm2+/+ and

and Mdm2P2/P2 MEFs with Cycloheximide and harvested
them at different time points (Figure 2A). A slight
enhancement in p53 stability was noticeable in Mdm2P2/
P2
MEFs. Nonetheless, the pattern of p53 degradation in
both MEF cell lines was similar. Moreover, the kinetics of
p53 degradation was also comparable between both MEF
genotypes. Notably, p53 half-life in both MEF lines was
limited to less than 30 minutes, consistent with previous
studies [21]. These experiments suggest that either
basal levels of Mdm2 are sufficient or other proteins are
involved in p53 degradation.
Next, we examined whether the pattern and kinetics
of p53 degradation after DNA damage were altered in
feedback loop deficient MEFs. To this effect, we irradiated
Mdm2+/+ and Mdm2P2/P2 MEFs with 6 Gy IR and allowed
p53 protein to accumulate for 3 hours. Subsequently, we
treated cells with Cycloheximide and harvested them at
different time points (Figure 2B). Interestingly, while the
stabilized p53 was quickly degraded in Mdm2+/+ MEFs,
it remained stable for a much longer duration in Mdm2P2/
P2
MEFs. The prolonged stability of p53 in Mdm2P2/P2
MEFs implies that stress induced Mdm2 is involved in
p53 degradation.
To test this hypothesis, we repeated the above
experiments in the presence of MG132, a proteosome
inhibitor (Figure 2C). Addition of MG132 completely
inhibited p53 degradation in un-irradiated and irradiated

Mdm2+/+ and Mdm2P2/P2 MEFs for the duration of the
experiment. This confirms that other E3 ligases, in
addition to Mdm2, are involved in p53 degradation.

Role of stress-induced Mdm2 levels in Mdm4
degradation
Mdm4, a structural homolog of Mdm2, is another
essential inhibitor of p53 [22]. Although Mdm4 lacks
E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, similar to Mdm2, it can bind
to p53 and inhibit its transcriptional activity [22]. This
interaction is critical for development as confirmed by
genetic experiments wherein the embryo lethal Mdm4null phenotype is rescued on a p53-null background [5,
23]. Mdm4 is also targeted by Mdm2 E3-ubiquitin ligase
activity [21]. RING domain mediated heterodimerization
between Mdm2 and Mdm4 is a critical step for this
degradation [21, 24]. To investigate whether p53 induced
Mdm2 plays a role in Mdm4 degradation, we examined
the degradation profiles of p53 and Mdm4 in Mdm2+/+
and Mdm2P2/P2 mouse thymi after IR (Figure 3A). As
previously noted in irradiated spleens [14] and MEFs
[above], p53 degradation was slightly impeded in Mdm2P2/
P2
mouse thymi after IR. However, the degradation pattern
of Mdm4 was identical in the two genotypes. These data
suggest that basal levels of Mdm2 expressed from the P1-

the degradation pattern of p53 in both mouse genotypes
remained similar (Figure 3B, 3C). Nonetheless, a slight
enhancement in stabilization and delay in degradation
of p53 was noticeable in spleens and thymi of
Mdm2P2/P2Mdm4+/− mice. This suggests that Mdm4 likely
contributes towards p53 degradation through Mdm2 in
mouse tissues.

Role of Mdm4 in p53 degradation
While Mdm4 is involved in inhibiting p53 activity
during development and under stress conditions, its role in
degradation of stress-induced p53 is not clear, especially
since Mdm4 lacks an inherent E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.
One possibility suggests that the role of Mdm4 in p53
degradation is masked by Mdm2 which is the dominant
homolog and also a transcriptional target of p53. Since in
our model p53-mediated induction of Mdm2 (and hence
increases in its level) is blocked, we next examined the
role of Mdm4 in stress induced p53 degradation. We asked
whether Mdm4 contributes towards Mdm2-mediated p53
degradation. To that end, we crossed Mdm2P2/P2 mice with
Mdm4+/− mice and generated Mdm2P2/P2Mdm4+/− mice.
Notably, these mice were born at normal Mendelian
ratios with no overt phenotypes. Next, we compared
p53 degradation profiles in spleens of Mdm2P2/P2 and
Mdm2P2/P2Mdm4+/− after exposure to 6 Gy IR. Importantly,

Mdm4 deficiency promotes p53 activity in
Mdm2P2/P2 background
We have reported that p53 activity is typically
enhanced in Mdm2P2/P2 mice in comparison to wild type
mice after DNA damage [14]. Thymus and spleen show
enhanced activation of p53 targets after IR. As Mdm4 is
also an inhibitor of p53 activity, we next compared p53
transcriptional activity in spleens from Mdm2P2/P2 and
Mdm2P2/P2Mdm4+/− mice. As expected, RT-qPCR analysis
showed that p53 activity was , but not significantly,
enhanced in these mice as compared to Mdm2P2/P2 mice
(Figure 4A).
Enhanced p53 activity imparts radiosensitivity
in Mdm2P2/P2 mice [14]. While all wild type mice
irradiated with 6 Gy IR survive, >80% Mdm2P2/P2 mice
exposed to 6 Gy IR die due to bone marrow (BM) failure
[14]. To examine whether enhanced p53 activity in
Mdm2P2/P2Mdm4+/− mice exacerbates the radiosensitive
phenotype, we monitored survival of irradiated mice
(Figure 4B). Notably, irradiated Mdm2P2/P2Mdm4+/−
mice died much earlier than the Mdm2P2/P2 mice. Early
death in response to the low dose radiation suggested
hematopoietic failure in these mice. Altogether, these
experiments suggest that Mdm4 cooperates with Mdm2 in
inhibiting p53 activity as reduction in Mdm4 gene dosage
further enhanced radiosensitivity of Mdm2P2/P2 mice.

Feedback loop in ageing
The role of p53 in ageing is controversial. Some
mouse models with enhanced p53 activity are associated
with ageing phenotypes as measured by increased genomic
aberrations and decline in stem cell numbers and function
[25, 26]. However, other mouse models with increased
p53 activity either due to a hypomorphic Mdm2 allele or
due to the expression of an extra copy of the p53 gene
do not exhibit ageing phenotypes [27, 28]. We previously
tested whether reduced levels of stress-induced Mdm2 in
feedback-defective Mdm2P2/P2 mice also influenced stem
cell number and function by quantifying hematopoietic
stem cell numbers in wild type and Mdm2P2/P2 mice by
flow cytometry [14]. Hematopoietic stem cell numbers
(Lin-Sca+Kit+; LSK) in unirradiated bone marrow were
similar in both genotypes [14]. Next, to evaluate the effect
on lifespan, we monitored a cohort of Mdm2P2/P2 and
Mdm2+/+ mice for 800 days [14]. Again, both groups of

mice exhibited normal survival and reproduction profiles.
No obvious signs of ageing such as lordokyphosis etc.
were observed in either genotype. This further confirms
that the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop is dispensable for
survival and its absence is not detrimental for normal
lifespan and functions.
We also investigated whether exposure to a minor
genotoxic insult could alter the survival profile of Mdm2P2/
P2
and Mdm2+/+ mice. To that end we exposed a cohort of
Mdm2P2/P2 and Mdm2+/+ mice (n=10) with 3 Gy IR and
monitored them for survival [14]. Again, no difference in
survival was evident in either mouse cohort. This suggests
that even in the absence of the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop,
small increases in p53 activity are well tolerated and do
not alter long term stem cell functionality. We have now
performed pathology on this cohort and found that 30%
(3 out of 10) of the irradiated Mdm2P2/P2 and Mdm2+/+
mice also developed lymphomas. These data concur with
a previous report that showed that pathological radiation
response is irrelevant for suppression of lymphoma
development later in life [29]. Together, these data
indicate that enhanced acute p53 activity generated in
the absence of the feedback loop does not protect against
tumorigenesis.

p53-Mdm2 feedback was considered the main mechanism
by which p53 autoregulates its activity and levels to
baseline following stress exposure. This was deemed
essential for homeostasis and development. Nonetheless,
p53-null and homozygous transcriptionally-compromised
p53 mutant mice are viable [30-32]. This in itself suggests
that p53-Mdm2 feedback regulation is dispensable for
development. Since the transactivation function of p53
is also compromised in null/mutant mice, we designed
novel experiments to test feedback loop functionality. The
viability of the Mdm2P2/P2 mouse which has wild type p53
and only lacks p53-mediated Mdm2 induction directly
shows that the feedback loop does not play an important
role during development. In contrast, mouse models with
further reduced Mdm2 levels show increased p53 activity
and developmental defects [27]. Therefore, p53 needs to
be tightly regulated for normal growth and development.
The viability of homozygous Mdm2P2/P2 mice and the lack
of any phenotypic aberrations suggest that basal Mdm2
levels from the P1-promoter are sufficient for regulating
p53 functions during development.
We also investigated the role of the feedback loop
in regulating p53 levels after different types of stress
exposures. p53 stabilization and degradation patterns
in both Mdm2+/+ and Mdm2P2/P2 mouse tissues were
indistinguishable. In addition, changes in the kinetics
of p53 degradation in Mdm2+/+ and Mdm2P2/P2 MEFs
in the presence or absence of DNA damage were quite
modest. Addition of MG132 inhibited p53 degradation
indicating that additional E3-ligases are likely involved

DISCUSSION
This study characterizes the p53-Mdm2 feedback
loop in vivo. Since its discovery in the early nineties, the

FUTURE PERSPECTIVES

in p53 degradation. The possibility exists that Mdm2 is
restricted to monoubiquitinating p53 while subsequent
polyubiquitination and degradation is carried out by other
proteins. Conversely, other unidentified protein(s) could be
responsible for the degradation of p53 after DNA damage
[20]. The Mdm2P2/P2 model provides an excellent system
to test these hypotheses.
Another important question addressed in this study
is whether stress induced Mdm2 is required for Mdm4
degradation. The degradation pattern of Mdm4 was not
altered in Mdm2+/+ and Mdm2P2/P2 genotypes. This suggests
that basal Mdm2 levels are sufficient to regulate Mdm4
degradation. To test the role of Mdm4 in stress-induced
p53 degradation, we compared the degradation pattern
of p53 in Mdm2P2/P2 and Mdm2P2/P2Mdm4+/− spleens. A
modest delay in p53 degradation in Mdm2P2/P2Mdm4+/−
spleens and thymi was observed. This implicates Mdm4
in p53 degradation. Possibly stabilization of Mdm2
by Mdm4 promotes p53 degradation. Additionally,
Mdm2P2/P2Mdm4+/− also exhibit enhanced p53 activity as
noted by increase in expression of p53 target genes in
the spleen. Survival of these mice after 6 Gy IR was also
shortened. These data suggest that Mdm4 cooperates with
Mdm2 in regulating p53.
Feedback autoregulation is essential for regulating
p53 activity specifically in the hematopoietic system after
DNA damage. In its absence, mice are radiosensitized and
die due to bone marrow annihilation [14]. However, the
lack of a feedback loop does not impact lifespan. Even
in the absence of this loop small increases in p53 activity
are well tolerated and do not alter stem cell functionality
[14]. Moreover, increase in acute p53 activity does not
promote ageing phenotypes or confer protection against
tumorigenesis.

Role of p53-Mdm2 feedback loop in other stem
cell types
In this and published studies, we have extensively
examined the role of the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop
in hematopoietic stem cells after DNA damage.
Hematopoietic stem cells are essential for maintaining a
normal pool of blood cells and sustaining hematopoiesis
throughout life. Mdm2P2/P2 mice are extremely sensitive to
irradiation and succumb to hematopoietic failure. A simple
bone marrow transplant experiment with unirradiated wild
type BM cells rescues the Mdm2P2/P2 mouse radiolethality
[14]. It will be interesting to test whether stem cells in
other tissues are also similarly sensitized in the absence
of the feedback loop. More specifically, neural stem cells
or spermatogonial stem cells which have been previously
shown to be radiosensitive in a p53 dependent manner can
be examined for this purpose [33, 34].
In addition to hematopoietic syndrome,
gastrointestinal failure is another fatality associated with
radiation exposure [35]. Gastrointestinal failure occurs due
to degeneration of the intestinal villi and crypts in response
to high doses of IR. p53-null mice are hypersensitive to GI
failure while mice with an extra copy of p53 are protected
[35, 36]. However, the role of acute p53 activity in GI
protection has not been rigorously examined. It will be
interesting to investigate the role of p53-Mdm2 feedback
loop and acute p53 activation in GI protection.

p53-Mdm2 feedback loop in evolution

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Evolution of p53 and Mdm2 has been traced
back to about 1.5 million years in the placozoans [37].
It is believed that Mdm2 functions primarily as the p53
regulator in all animal species. On the basis of our study,
it is easy to comprehend that Mdm2 might be required
to inhibit p53 activity in stem cells after DNA damage.
This is essential to maintain its genomic integrity function.
Unfortunately, p53 responsive Mdm2 promoters have not
been described in all the species. It will be interesting
to trace the evolution of the dual Mdm2 promoters and
the feedback loop. Also it is worth noting that Mdm2 is
not found in D. melanogaster and C. elegans while p53
function are essentially the same in both species [37].
While the reasons for this anomaly are not clear, they
warrant a thorough investigation. Perhaps, introducing
a codon justified Mdm2 in these animals can provide
insights into the role of feedback loop here.

MEF culture and Cycloheximide studies: MEFs
were generated and maintained as previously described.
Early passage cells (P2-P3) were used for all experiments.
Cycloheximide was added at 20ug/ml and cells were
harvested at different time points. Protein lysate was
prepared in NP-40 lysis buffer containing protease
inhibitor cocktail. 100 µg of protein was resolved on 8%
SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane
and bloated with either an, anti-p53 antibody (CM5,
Vector biolabs), anti-Mdm4 antibody (MX82, Sigma) or
anti-Vinculin antibody (V9131, Sigma). p53 expression
was quantitated using Image J software (NIH).
Mouse radiation studies: All animal studies were
conducted in compliance with IACUC approved protocols.
Mice were radiated at 6 Gy IR and survival curve plotted
using graphpad software. For p53 stability experiments,
tissues were harvested at different time points, lysed
in NP-40 buffer and analyzed by western blotting as
described above.

While many E3-ubiquiting ligases have been
identified for p53 degradation only Mdm2 has been
verified by in vivo studies. Here we examined the role
of Mdm2 in degradation of p53 after DNA damage.
The slightly delayed but eventual degradation of p53 in
Mdm2P2/P2 mice suggests that Mdm2 may not be sufficient
by itself to degrade stress-induced p53. As addition
of MG132, a proteosome inhibitor drug, inhibits p53
degradation in MEFs after IR, this suggests that other E3ligases might be involved. It is also possible that Mdm2
is primarily involved in monoubiquitinating p53 and the
mark is recognized by other unidentified E3 ligases that
promote polyubiquitination and complete degradation of
p53 by the proteosome machinery. Mdm2P2/P2 mice/cells
with a defective feedback loop can be used to test these
hypotheses.

Inhibition of p53-Mdm2 interaction as a
therapeutic strategy

Our results show that hematopoietic system is
extremely sensitive to p53 activity variations. HSC
share many characteristics with leukemia stem cells
[38]. Therefore, transient activation of p53 by inhibiting
the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop in conjunction with DNA
damage could be an effective therapeutic strategy for
sensitizing stem cells in these malignancies. This could
be a safer alternative to high-dose radio/chemotherapy
regimens which have bystander effects. In fact, similar
ideas are currently being tested in the clinic [39].

dispensable for inhibiting p53 activity during development
but is critical for regulating p53 activity in HSCs after
DNA damage. In contrast to the existing paradigm, the
feedback loop is not as important for regulating p53
stability. This suggests that other yet unknown E3 ligases
might play a more important or compensatory role in
p53 stability. The Mdm2P2/P2 mouse presents a unique
opportunity to identify these E3 ligases and to test other
hypotheses involving p53 regulation by Mdm2 and Mdm4.
