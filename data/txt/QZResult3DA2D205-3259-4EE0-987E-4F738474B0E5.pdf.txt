ABSTRACT
Androgen Receptor (AR) is the male hormone receptor and a nuclear transcription
factor which plays a central role in the growth of normal and malignant prostate
gland. Our earlier studies defined a mechanistic model for male hormone dependent
regulation of AR protein levels in prostate cancer (CaP) cells through a negative feedback loop between AR and PMEPA1, an androgen induced NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin ligase
binding protein. This report focuses on the impact of PMEPA1 silencing on CaP biology.
PMEPA1 knockdown accelerated the growth of CaP tumor cells in athymic nude mice.
In cell culture models knockdown of PMEPA1 resulted in resistance to AR inhibitors
enzalutamide and bicalutamide. While, AR protein down regulation by NEDD4 was
PMEPA1 dependent, we also noted a PMEPA1 independent downregulation of PTEN by
NEDD4. In a subset of human CaP, decreased PMEPA1 mRNA expression significantly
correlated with increased levels of AR transcription target PSA, as a surrogate for
elevated AR. This study highlights that silencing of PMEPA1 accelerates the growth of
CaP cells through AR, NEDD4 and PTEN. Thus, the therapeutic restoration of PMEPA1
represents a promising complementary strategy correcting for AR and PTEN defects
in CaP. Statement of significance: Here we define that silencing of PMEPA1 facilitates
the growth of CaP cells and modulates AR through NEDD4 and PTEN. The restoration
of PMEPA1 represents a promising complementary therapeutic strategy correcting
for AR and PTEN defects.

contribute to prostate cancer (CaP) development and
progression [1–5, 8]. In clinical practice, androgen
ablation continues to be the corner stone for the treatment
of advanced CaP [7, 9–11]. Unfortunately, androgen
ablation treated CaPs eventually become treatment
resistant, the stage of the disease known as castration
resistant CaP (CRPC). Altered AR expression or function
(gain or loss) resulting from genomic or non-genomic
mechanisms associate with CRPC [1–5]. In contrast
to other aspects of AR alterations, only a few studies
have addressed how AR protein turnover is altered in
CaP [12, 13]. A shorter half-life of AR was noted in

INTRODUCTION
AR is a nuclear transcription factor that executes
key function in normal and malignant growth of the
prostate gland [1–5]. The tight control of AR signaling
is critical in maintaining the homeostasis of the prostate
gland. Malignancy of prostate still remains the most
common cancer detected in American men and second
leading cause of cancer related deaths [6, 7]. Cancerassociated dysfunctions of AR, such as aberrant
activation due to mutations, amplification, splicing and
cross talk with other pro-cancer signaling pathways

the androgen responsive LNCaP cells as compared to
its longer half life in the androgen refractory derivative
C4–2B cells [14]. Early reports of the mechanisms of
AR degradation showed that MDM2 E3 ubiquitin ligase
targeted the AR through AKT mediated phosphorylation
of MDM2 [15]. Our studies have implicated NEDD4
E3 ligase in AR degradation [16–19]. Studies have
also described downregulation of AR by proteasome
dependent degradation during mitosis suggesting AR as
a licensing factor for DNA replication in CaP cells [20,
21]. Emerging data also suggests for the role of other E3
ubiquitin ligases (CHIP, SKP2, Siah2, RNF6) in the AR
degradation or transcriptional activation [13]. A recent
report showed that SPOP E3 ubiquitin ligase degrades
AR protein and the recurrent genomic mutations of
the SPOP noted in 5–10% of CaPs impair the SPOP
mediated AR degradation [22, 23].
PMEPA1 was originally identified by our laboratory
as a prostate abundant, highly androgen induced gene
that mapped to chromosome 20q13.31-q13.33 [16].
Human PMEPA1 protein exhibits 83% amino acid
identity to the mouse Nedd4-bindng protein, N4wbp4
[16, 24]. PMEPA1 is a direct transcriptional target of
AR in CaP cells [18]. Further Investigations discovered
a PMEPA1- AR negative feedback loop in the regulation
of AR protein levels in CaP cells [19]. Members of the
NEDD4 family of proteins are E3 ubiquitin ligases,
which catalyze degradation of target proteins of
physiologically important functions by the ubiquitinprosteasome pathway [25, 26]. Initial evaluations
of PMEPA1 mRNA expression in matched normal
and prostate tumor specimens suggested decreased
expression of PMEPA1 in two-third of CaP patients [17].
In contrast to CaPs, higher expression of PMEPA1 has
been noted in multiple solid tumors [27, 28]. Studies
have also shown induction of PMEPA1 expression
by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) that was
associated with colonocyte terminal differentiation [29].
Subsequent studies have defined that PMEPA1 inhibits
TGF-β receptor 1 meditated signaling through a negative
feedback loop by sequestering R-Smads [30]. Increased
PMEPA1 expression in breast and lung cancer may lead
to inhibition of TGF-β signaling [31–33]. PMEPA1
has also been reported to promote the proliferation of
AR negative CaP cells, PC3, through the Smad3–4/CMYC/p21Cip1 pathway [34, 35]. Taken together, both
reduced and increased PMEPA1 expression may promote
tumorigenesis through distinct cell signaling pathways in
a given cellular background.
In this report, we present new findings on the
cancer biologic properties of decreased PMEPA1
expression. Loss or decreased PMEPA1 expression
in CaP contributes to accelerated cell growth through
increased AR and NEDD4, decreased PTEN levels and
confers resistance to AR inhibitors used in androgen
ablation therapy.

Inhibition of PMEPA1 promotes the growth of
prostate cancer cells
We have examined the impact of PMEPA1
depletion on tumor growth in vivo. We have characterized
PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP and PMEPA1shRNA-VCaP stable
transfectants to assess the growth of prostate tumor cells
in vitro. We observed enhanced cancer cell biologic features
by monitoring cell growth, BrdU incorporation, cell plating
efficiency, soft agar colony formation, growth response to
androgen and cell cycle (Supplementary Figure 1).
We evaluated the tumor growth characteristics of
PMEPA1shRNA harboring LNCaP cells in athymic nude
mouse tumor xenograft model. The PMEPA1shRNALNCaP and control shRNA-LNCaP cells began to form
subcutaneous tumors at 4 weeks post-injection. The
overall growth of PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP derived
tumors was significantly faster than control derived
tumors (p < 0.05) (Figure 1A). At 9 week post-injection
among 20 mice in each group, 18 mice formed measurable
subcutaneous tumors in the PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP
group. In contrast, only 12 mice formed tumors in the
control group. The tumor formation rate was 90% in
the PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP group and only 60% in the
control. The average tumor volume was 2246.04 mm3 for
PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP and 1211.64 mm3 for the control.
PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP tumors expressed higher levels
of AR and PSA proteins compared to control cells as
assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (Figure 1B and
Table 1). The tumor size in the control group decreased
21% at two weeks post-injection in response to castration.
In contrast, PMEPA1shRNA-LNCaP xenografts were
refractory to castration. By seven weeks post-castration,
the overall tumor size was four times larger than the
initial tumor size (100%) in PMEPA1shRNA harboring
xenografts (increased by 304%), in contrast to the control
group (increased by 69%) (p < 0.05) (Figure 1C). Taken
together, both in vitro and in vivo growth characteristics of
PMEPA1shRNA harboring cells resulted in increased AR,
gain of AR function and accelerated tumor growth under
normal, as well as under castrate conditions.

PMEPA1 depletion leads to resistance to
AR inhibitors
To further investigate the role of decreased
PMEPA1 levels in enhancing tumor cell growth by gain
of AR function, dose and time kinetic response to the AR
inhibitors, enzalutamide and bicalutamide were assessed in
cell growth assays. PMEPA1 depletion conferred resistance
to AR inhibitors in both LNCaP and VCaP cells (Figure 2A
and 2B, Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B). Additionally,
enhanced resistance to AR inhibitors was confirmed
by BrdU incorporation, soft agar colony formation and

2C–2E). Consistent with these observations, cell cycle
analysis showed higher number of cells in S-phase and
decreased rate of apoptosis in response to PMEPA1
inhibition (Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 2F). The
observed enhanced resistance to AR inhibitors in response
to PMEPA1 depletion was consistent with the observed
castration resistance of PMEPA1shRNA harboring tumor
xenografts. Taken together, these data suggest that loss

levels. Thus, we evaluated if inhibition of PMEPA1 can
restore CaP cell growth overriding the inhibition of AR.
Indeed, co-transfection of AR and PMEPA1 siRNAs in
LNCaP cells reversed effects of AR depletion by siRNA
on AR protein (Figure 3A). While parental LNCaP cells
exhibited severe growth inhibition in response to AR
siRNA, simultaneous knockdown of PMEPA1 rescued
the growth of cancer cells (Figure 3B). These data further
supported that the observed enhanced cell proliferation in
response to PMEPA1 depletion was due to elevated AR
protein levels and AR signaling.

NEDD4 facilitates PTEN degradation in

and AR. This observation was also supported by
marked stabilization of AR in LNCaP cells harboring
ectopically expressed NEDD4 in the background of
PMEPA1 knockdown (Figure 4B). Further, decreases in
AR levels in response to ectopic PMEPA1 expression
were abolished by NEDD4 knockdown in LNCaP cells
(Figure 4C). As expected, the cell growth read out
reflected the AR status (Figure 4B and 4C). Conversely,
ectopic expression of NEDD4 in PMEPA1 shRNA stable
transfectants was refractory to AR biochemical signals
and associated features (Figure 4D). These findings
established that both PMEPA1 and NEDD4 are essential
in AR mediated cell growth.

Genomic deletions and reduced expression of PTEN
is frequently noted in CaPs which correlates with adverse
pathologic features [36]. Ubiquitin-mediated degradation
of PTEN by NEDD4 has been reported [37, 38]. As noted,
above PMEPA1 depletion in CaP cells also resulted in
elevated NEDD4 levels. Thus, we reasoned that decreased
PMEPA1 may contribute to reduced levels of PTEN, a
known NEDD4 target in CaP cells. In VCaP cells harboring
wild type PTEN, ectopic expression of NEDD4 downregulates PTEN protein levels (Figure 6A). Moreover, the
PMEPA1 knockdown led to elevated levels of AR protein,
increased NEDD4 and decreased PTEN protein levels
(Figure 6B). These findings suggest that loss of PMEPA1
may contribute to the defects of PTEN and alterations
in NEDD4 through AR that is consistent with reported
associations of PTEN and AR with CaP progression [36].
Thus, PMEPA1 may in part also affects NEDD4 mediated
PTEN degradation in the context of androgen responsive
CaP cells. However, NEDD4 can target PTEN independent
of AR or PMEPA1. Ectopically expressed PTEN directly
interacting with AR, has been shown to facilitate AR
degradation and to inhibit AR nuclear translocation in
PTEN null LNCaP cells [39]. Due to this reciprocal
relationship between AR and PTEN, we evaluated the
cooperative effects of PTEN knockdown and PMEPA1
depletion on cell growth, AR levels and AR transcriptional
targets. Transfection of VCaP cells with PMEPA1 or PTEN
siRNA resulted in enhanced cell growth, increased levels of
AR and its targets, PSA and NEDD4. Cells depleted in both
PMEPA1 and PTEN led to further increases in AR and cell
growth (Figure 6C and 6D). Cumulatively, loss or reduced
expression of PMEPA1 may lead to higher levels of AR
and decreased levels of PTEN resulting in a feedforward
enhancement in cell growth as shown in simultaneous
depletion of PMEPA1 and PTEN.

NEDD4 down-regulates AR protein levels and
inhibits cell growth in hormone responsive
prostate cancer cells
Our previous study has revealed that PMEPA1
binds to NEDD4 through the interaction between PY
motifs of PMEPA1 and WW domain of human NEDD4
protein [17]. Thus, we evaluated the role of NEDD4 on
CaP cell growth and AR protein levels. Knockdown of
NEDD4 by specific siRNA led to strikingly elevated
levels of AR and PSA in LNCaP and VCaP cells
(Figure 5A). Conversely, ectopic expression of the
NEDD4 resulted in decreased levels of AR protein in
both LNCaP and VCaP cells (Figure 5B). Further, ectopic
expression of NEDD4 resulted in a significant inhibition
of cell growth (Figure 5C and 5D). In parallel, we also
evaluated the effects MDM2 E3 ligase on AR which has
been reported to be involved in AR degradation [15]. As
expected, transfection of the MDM2 siRNA, resulted
in elevated AR and PSA protein levels in both LNCaP
and VCaP cells (Figure 5E and 5F). Taken together,
these findings underscored that NEDD4 mediates AR
degradation and cell growth inhibition in hormone
responsive VCaP and LNCaP cells.

Better understanding of mechanisms controlling AR protein
levels may also help in developing new therapeutic strategies

Cumulative data underscore the association of
reduced or absent PMEPA1 expression in CaP cells with

However, the impact of attenuated PMEPA1 expression
in the interface of NEDD4, AR and PTEN in CaP biology
and the effects on therapeutic AR inhibitors has not been
examined before. Three major consequences of loss of
PMEPA1 in CaP are summarized in the working model
(Figure 6E). First, PMEPA1 knockdown accelerated the
growth of LNCaP tumors in athymic nude mouse and
in cell culture models. Second, PMEPA1 knockdown
resulted in enhanced resistance to both enzalutamide
and bicalutamide inhibitors of AR. Third, we noted
that PMEPA1 silencing increased NEDD4-mediated
downregulation of PTEN, further enhancing the growth of
CaP cells. In agreement with cell culture models, in human
CaP specimens decreased PMEPA1 expression correlated
with increased AR transcriptional function as measured by
PSA/KLK3 mRNA expression.
One of the new findings of this study is the androgen
induction of NEDD4 E3 ligase that may impose additional
level of hormonal control on AR and PTEN degradation
(Supplementary Figure 3A–3C). Previous studies
reported androgen induction of NEDD4L transcripts [40].
Informatics analysis of regulatory elements in the NEDD4
gene locus indicated the presence of a cluster of androgen
responsive elements (Supplementary Figure 3D).
Of note, this study also provides novel findings of
cooperation between PMEPA1 and PTEN defects leading
to enhanced CaP cell growth. While PMEPA1 depletion
uncouples NEDD4 from AR degradation, increased levels
of NEDD4 remains available for PTEN degradation,
leading to simultaneous gain of AR and loss of PTEN in
CaP cells. Evaluating the mechanism of PMEPA1 silencing
in previous studies we have shown that methylation of the
first intronic DNA region of PMEPA1 gene is a prevalent
mechanism of PMEPA1 silencing in human prostate CaP
[41]. In conclusion, this study highlights that silencing of
PMEPA1 accelerates the growth of CaP cells through AR,
NEDD4 and PTEN. Taken together, these data provide

support for the dual impact of PMEPA1 restoration as a
complementary approach in correcting for AR and PTEN
defects in CaP and highlights biomarker potential of
monitoring PMEPA1 during androgen ablation therapy.

8816, Cat#18–8817-33, eBioscience, San Diego, CA).
Antibodies for immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay were:
anti-PMEPA1 antibody mentioned above, anti-AR mouse
monoclonal antibody (M3562, DAKO, Denmark), antiPSA rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cat#A0562, DAKO,
Denmark), biotinylated horse anti-mouse antibody (Cat#
BA-2000, Vector, Burlingame, CA), biotinylated goat antirabbit antibody (Cat# BA-1000, Vector, Burlingame, CA)
and VIP peroxidase (HRP) substrate kit (Cat# SK-4600,
Vector, Burlingame, CA).

Cell counting assays
The CaP cells (LNCaP and VCaP cells) were seeded
in 6 cm culture dishes at the density of 2 × 105 cells/dish.
Cells were grown at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 2 days followed
by transfection with plasmids (pcDNA3.1, pcDNA3.1PMEPA1, pCMV-XL4, pCMV-XL4-NEDD4 or pCMVXL4-AR) or siRNA (non-targeting, PMEPA1, AR, NEDD4
or PTEN siRNA) using lipofectamine 2000 procedure. The
AR inhibitors treatment experiments were conducted with
PMEPA1 shRNA1 harboring LNCaP and VCaP cells. The
transfected cells or the stable transfectants were harvested
at indicated time points post-transfection with 0.25%
trypsin plus EDTA (Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA). Cells
were re-suspended into 10 ml regular medium, and 10 μl
of single cell suspension was applied to hemocytometer
for cell counting with trypan blue (Cat#72–57-1, SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO).

Athymic nude mouse tumorigenicity assay
Ten weeks old athymic Ncr-nu/nu mice (National
Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD) were evaluated in tumor
xenografts derived from PMEPA1 shRNA LNCaP and
control-shRNA LNCaP cells. Mice were maintained under
pathogen-free conditions in accordance with established
NIH guideline under the animal protocol approved by
Uniformed Services of University of the Health Sciences,
Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. A total of
40 athymic nude mice were subdivided into two groups:
control-shRNA LNCaP and PMEPA1-shRNA LNCaP with
20 mice in each group. Transfectant cells were resuspended in
RPMI1640 medium mixed with 50% matrigel (Cat#354234,
BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA). Each mouse received
4 × 106 cells in 200 μl medium by subcutaneous injection

Cell cycle analysis by fluorescence activated
cell sorting
Ten million cells of PMEPA1 shRNA transfectant
LNCaP or VCaP cells were harvested by centrifugation
at 180 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 300 μl
PBS (pH 7.4), and 5 ml methanol was added drop-wise
and vortexed at low speed. The fixed cells were incubated
in methanol at –20°C for 30 min. After removing the
methanol cells were stained by propidium iodide dye

to right frank side. Injected mice were monitored for tumor
formation twice per week post injection. The end point of
the experiment represented tumor diameter of 1.5 cm or 6
weeks after xenograft tumor formation. The excised tumor
tissue was fixed in 10% formalin, paraffin-embedded and
sectioned for 5 μm slides for Hematoxylin and Eosin stain
and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for PMEPA1, AR
and PSA. Total 10 foci with 20X magnification were randomly
examined from each IHC staining slides for quantitative
analysis with ImageJ software (version 1.48, National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The IHC procedures were
described in details in the Supplementary Methods.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using RNA
laser capture microdissected matched normal and
prostate tumor specimens as described in Sterbis et al
[42]. PCR primers and Taqman probes were as follows:
PMEPA1, 5′-CATGATCCCCGAGCTGCT-3′ (forward),
5′-TGATCTGAACAAACTCCAGCTCC-3′
(reverse),
and 6FAM-5′-AGGCGGACAGTCTCCTGCGAAACC3′-TAMRA
(probe);
PSA/KLK3,
5′-CCCACTG
CATCAGGAACAAA-3′ (forward), 5′-GAGCGGGTGTG
GGAAGCT-3′ (reverse), and 6FAM-5′-ACACAGGCCAG
GTATTTCAGGTCAGCC-3′-TAMRA (probe). The
expression of GAPDH served as an endogenous control
measured in the same tube as the target gene (GAPDH
control mix, Applied Biosystems). Target gene expression
in each sample was normalized to GAPDH. Results were
plotted as average Ct (cycle threshold) values of duplicate
samples. Relative gene expression level was presented
as dCt in tumor versus matched benign cells, where dCt
represents normalized Ct value of target genes to GAPDH.
Statistical analysis of quantitative expression of PMEPA1
and PSA mRNA was evaluated in 82 patients (164 tumor
and matched normal samples). The sample size (N = 82)
was determined by statistical power calculation (90% power
with 0.05 alpha, two sided Chi-square test). Distributions of
other clinico-pathological variables were examined by using
Chi-square or Fisher exact tests.
