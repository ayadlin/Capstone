Summary
DNA mismatch repair (MMR) ensures replication fidelity by correcting mismatches generated
during DNA replication. Although human MMR has been reconstituted in vitro, how MMR occurs
in vivo is unknown. Here, we show that an epigenetic histone mark, H3K36me3, is required in
vivo to recruit the mismatch recognition protein hMutSα (hMSH2-hMSH6) onto chromatin
through direct interactions with the hMSH6 PWWP domain. The abundance of H3K36me3 in G1
and early S phases ensures that hMutSα is enriched on chromatin before mispairs are introduced
during DNA replication. Cells lacking the H3K36 tri-methyltransferase SETD2 display
microsatellite instability (MSI) and an elevated spontaneous mutation frequency, characteristic of
MMR-deficient cells. This work reveals that a histone mark regulates MMR in human cells and
explains the long-standing puzzle of MSI-positive cancer cells that lack detectable mutations in
known MMR genes.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

DNA mismatch repair (MMR) maintains genome stability primarily by correcting base- base
and small insertion/deletion (ID) mispairs generated during DNA replication (Kolodner,
1996; Kunkel and Erie, 2005; Li, 2008; Modrich and Lahue, 1996). In human cells, these
mispairs are recognized by hMSH2-hMSH6 (hMutSα) and hMSH2-hMSH3 (hMutSβ).
Normally, cells express more hMSH6 than hMSH3, leading to a hMutSα:hMutSβ ratio of
~10:1 (Drummond et al., 1997; Marra et al., 1998). Despite their redundant activities in
mismatch recognition, both complexes are required for MMR, and defective or abnormal
expression of hMSH6 or hMSH3 leads to a mutator phenotype (Drummond et al., 1997;
Drummond et al., 1995; Harrington and Kolodner, 2007; Marsischky et al., 1996). Previous
studies have shown that genetic and epigenetic modifications that impair the expression of
these and other MMR genes, especially hMSH2, hMSH6 and hMLH1, cause susceptibility

to certain types of cancer, including hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)
(Fishel and Kolodner, 1995; Kane et al., 1997; Modrich and Lahue, 1996).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

At the cellular level, defects in MMR cause a mutator phenotype, which can be readily
detected in eukaryotic cells as instability in simple repetitive DNA sequences called
microsatellites. Thus, microsatellite instability (MSI) is regarded as a hallmark of MMR
deficiency (Kolodner, 1996; Kunkel and Erie, 2005; Li, 2008; Modrich and Lahue, 1996).
However, a significant fraction of MSI-positive colorectal cancers express MMR genes at
normal levels and do not carry a detectable mutation in or hypermethylation of known MMR
genes (Peltomaki, 2003). Similarly, certain non-colorectal cancer cells with MSI also appear
to be proficient in MMR (Gu et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2011). The molecular mechanism
underlying MSI in these cases is obscure.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The MMR capacity of mammalian cells has typically been evaluated using a functional
assay that measures in vitro repair of a naked model DNA heteroduplex (Holmes et al.,
1990; Thomas et al., 1991; Zhang et al., 2005). This assay has helped identify MMR defects
in HNPCC and other MSI-positive cancers (Parsons et al., 1993; Umar et al., 1994) and has
been invaluable in characterizing the MMR pathway in human cells in great molecular detail
(reviewed by (Li, 2008)). However, increasing evidence suggests that a mismatch assembled
into nucleosomes is a poor substrate for the in vitro MMR system. Li et al. (Li et al., 2009)
showed that nucleosomes derived from recombinant histones and a mismatch-containing
DNA diminished the mismatch binding, ATPase and DNA sliding activities of hMutSα,
which are required for MMR. Schopf et al. (Schopf et al., 2012) demonstrated that hMutSα
failed to restore MMR to an hMSH6-deficient nuclear extract when DNA heteroduplexes
were assembled into nucleosomes by preincubating with the extract. These observations
suggest that additional factors and/or mechanisms are needed for MMR in vivo, possibly by
disrupting nucleosomes or timely recruiting MMR proteins, or both. Consistent with this
hypothesis, histone modifications and chromatin remodeling factors have been implicated in
MMR (Javaid et al., 2009; Kadyrova et al., 2011) and MMR has been show to couple with
DNA replication (Hombauer et al., 2011a; Simmons et al., 2008), during which nucleosomes
are disrupted. More strikingly, the hMSH6 subunit of hMutSα contains a Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro
(PWWP) domain (Laguri et al., 2008) and this domain, which is present in many chromatinassociated proteins, was recently identified as a ‘reader’ of trimethylated Lys36 in histone 3
(H3K36me3) (Dhayalan et al., 2010; Vermeulen et al., 2010; Vezzoli et al., 2010). However,
it is not yet known whether the H3K36me3 mark plays a role in MMR.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Here, we demonstrate that H3K36me3 interacts specifically with the hMSH6 PWWP
domain of hMutSα in vitro and in vivo, and that the histone methyltransferase SETD2,
which is responsible for trimethylation of H3K36 (Edmunds et al., 2008), is required for
human MR in vivo. Consistent with this, cells depleted of SETD2 and H3K36me3 display a
mutator phenotype characterized by MSI and an elevated mutation frequency at the HPRT
locus. The data presented here strongly suggest that the H3K36me3 histone mark regulates
human MMR in vivo by recruiting hMutSα onto chromatin to be replicated. We therefore
propose that the status of H3K36me3 in a specific gene or intergenic region could
potentially influence the local mutation rate in that region of the chromosome.

Results
The hMSH6 PWWP domain interacts with H3K36me3 and is essential for hMutSα binding
to chromatin
The hMSH6 subunit of hMutSα contains a PWWP domain (Laguri et al., 2008) and this
conserved domain has recently been proposed to interact specifically with H3K36me3
(Dhayalan et al., 2010; Vermeulen et al., 2010; Vezzoli et al., 2010). Figure 1A shows an

alignment of the hMSH6 PWWP domain with 5 other PWWP domains, including that of
BRPF1, the only PWWP domain for which an atomic resolution structure of the complex
with H3K36me3 is available (Vezzoli et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2011). Interestingly, the cocrystal structures of the BRPF1 PWWP and H3K36me3 peptide (Vezzoli et al., 2010; Wu et
al., 2011) indicate that three residues in the PWWP domain form an aromatic cage
surrounding the H3K36me3 (Figure 1B, left). Consistent with this, our alignment of PWWP
domains shows that the proposed ‘cage’ residues are highly conserved (Figure 1A, blue
dots). Based on these data, we generated a model of hMSH6 bound to the H3K36me3
peptide (Figure 1B, right) by superimposing the PWWP domains of hMSH6 and BRPF1
(Laguri et al., 2008).
The above data prompted us to ask whether the H3K36me3 mark modulates the interaction
between hMutSα and chromatin and whether such an interaction involves the hMSH6
PWWP domain. To answer these questions, a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein
including hMSH6 residues 89 to 194 was used to pull down histone octamers isolated from
HeLa cells (carrying ‘native’ histone modifications) or assembled using recombinant
histones. The results show that the hMSH6 PWWP domain efficiently pulls down histone
octamers from HeLa cells, but it pulls down recombinant histone octamers with very low
efficiency (Figure 2A). This suggests a specific interaction between the hMSH6 PWWP
domain and an epigenetic histone signature.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The specificity of the interaction between the hMSH6 PWWP domain and natively modified
octamers was examined by the following experiments. First, the same pull-down assay was
performed using native histone octamers purified from HeLa cells (Rodriguez-Collazo et al.,
2009) and wild type or a mutant hMSH6 PWWP fusion protein in which W105 and W106
are replaced by two alanines (PAAP), and the histone octamers bound to the GST-fusion
proteins were detected by an H3K36me3-specific antibody. As shown in Figure 2B, wild
type (WT) but not the mutant GST-hMSH6 PWWP selectively binds native histone
octamers containing H3K36me3. Similar results were also obtained with a PWWP mutant
containing an Y103A mutation (data not shown). Second, when H3 peptides containing no,
mono-, di-, or tri-methylated K36 were incubated with hMutSα in the pull-down assay
(Figure 2C), little interaction was detected between hMutSα and the peptide containing no
(K36) or mono- (K36me1) methylations, but hMutSα was pulled down by di- (H3K36me2)
and tri- (K36me3) methylated peptides, with approximately 5-fold more hMutSα coprecipitating with trimethylated peptide than with dimethylated peptide. These results
suggest that hMutSα preferentially binds to H3K36me3.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the following experiments, the interaction between the trimethylated peptide from H3 and
several PWWP-mutated hMutSα variants was examined. One mutant hMutSα contained a
PAAP motif (hMutSα[PAAP]) instead of the PWWP motif and another had a deletion of the
first 340 amino acid residues (Δ340), including the PWWP domain, in hMSH6
(hMutSα[Δ340]). As shown in Figure 2D, the H3K36me3 peptide pulled down wild type
hMutSα but did not pull down PWWP-deficient hMutSα proteins. Finally, coimmunoprecipitation was performed to confirm the interaction between the hMutSα PWWP
domain and the H3K36me3-containing histone octamer. Here, recombinant histone H3 with
an analog of trimethylated K36 (Kc36me3) (Simon et al., 2007) was used to assemble
histone octamers; the octamers were recognized by antibody specific to H3K36me3 (Figure
2E), indicating that H3Kc36me3 is structural mimic of H3K36me3. The resulting
H3Kc36me3 octamers were then incubated with hMutSα or hMutSα[PAAP]. As shown in
Figure 2F, hMSH2 antibody only co-immunoprecipitated wild type hMutSα and
H3Kc36me3-containing octamers. Thus, these data support the idea that the hMSH6 PWWP
domain interacts specifically with trimethylated H3K36 in vitro and suggest that a similar
specific interaction between hMutSα and H3K36me3 might occur on chromatin in vivo.

PWWP domain is dispensable for MMR in vitro, but essential for hMSH6 interaction with
chromatin

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The role of the hMSH6 PWWP domain in MMR was tested by analyzing the ability of wild
type hMutSα or PWWP-deficient hMutSα to restore MMR to a nuclear extract from a
MSH2-deficient leukemia cell line, NALM6 (Gu et al., 2002), using a functional in vitro
assay (Zhang et al., 2005). Surprisingly, both PWWP-deficient proteins, hMutSα[PAAP]
and hMutSα[Δ3 40], could efficiently restore MMR to NALM6 extracts (Figure 3A),
suggesting that the hMSH6 PWWP domain is not essential for MMR in vitro.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The role of the hMSH6 PWWP domain in localizing hMSH6 to chromatin was examined in
hMSH6-deficient DLD-1 cells expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)tagged wild type or mutant hMSH6. Three hMSH6 mutants were generated, which
contained alanine substitutions at the aromatic cage residues W105 and W106 (PAAP), Y103
(Y103A) or F133 (F133A). DLD-1 cells expressing EGFP-tagged wild type hMSH6,
hMSH6(Y103A), hMSH6(PAAP) or hMSH6(F133A) were arrested in S phase and then
analyzed by fluorescent confocal microscopy. The results show that hMSH6 clearly formed
foci in cells expressing wild type hMSH6, but significantly (p<0.001) fewer hMSH6 foci
were found in cells expressing the mutant hMSH6 proteins (Figures 3B and 3C); instead,
fluorescence remained evenly distributed in the nucleus in the latter cells (Figure 3B).
Together with the data shown in Figures 1 and 2, these observations imply that the hMSH6
PWWP domain, although not required for MMR in vitro, is required to recruit hMSH6 to
chromatin. This supports the idea that the hMSH6 PWWP domain ‘reads’ the H3K36me3
mark.
H3K36me3 facilitates localization of hMutSα to chromatin in vivo
SETD2 is a methyltransferase responsible for H3K36 trimethylation (Duns et al., 2010;
Edmunds et al., 2008; Yoh et al., 2008). To determine if hMSH6 chromatin localization
relies on H3K36me3, we performed SETD2 knockdown by shRNA in DLD-1 cells, which
apparently led to a targeted depletion of SETD2, as the same vector containing a scrambled
shRNA (control) did not reduce expression of SETD2 (Figure 3D). As expected, the
SETD2-knockdown cells expressed a low level of H3K36me3 (Figure 3D). Interestingly,
hMSH6 formed distinct foci in control DLD-1 cells, but it formed fewer foci and was
distributed more evenly within the nucleus in shSETD2-DLD-1 cells (Figure 3E). These
results suggest that H3K36me3 influences the distribution of hMSH6 in chromatin.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

This idea was further tested with the endogenous hMSH6 in MMR-proficient HeLa cells
with or without a targeted SETD2 knockdown by shRNA (Figure 4A). After
synchronization of control HeLa (transfected with a scrambled shRNA) and SETD2depleted HeLa in S or G2/M phase, chromatin localization of endogenously expressed
hMSH6 was monitored by immunofluorescence using an antibody to hMSH6. The results
show that during S phase, significantly fewer hMSH6 foci were observed in the SETD2/
H3K36me3-depleted HeLa cells than in control HeLa cells (Figures 4B and 4C), further
supporting the idea that localization of hMSH6 to chromatin is facilitated by H3K36me3. In
addition, ~70% of hMSH6 foci appeared to colocalize with H3K36me3 in control HeLa
cells but not in SETD2/H3K36me3-depleted cells (Figure 4B). Similar results were also
obtained using an antibody to hMSH2 (Supplemental Figure S1A), indicating that the effect
is for the whole hMutSα complex. These results were confirmed in another HeLa clone
whose SEDT2 was stably knocked down by a second SETD2 shRNA (Figure S1B).
Interestingly, the number of hMSH6 foci (Figures 4B and 4C) was very low in control G2/M
HeLa cells. However, this has nothing to do with the amount of hMSH6 in these cells
because hMSH6 in G2/M is as abundant as in other cell cycle phases (Figures 4D and 4E).

To determine if this phenomenon is directly correlated with the abundance of H3K36me3,
H3K36me3 and H3 were quantified in HeLa cells arrested at different stages of the cell
cycle. The results show that H3K36me3 reaches a maximum abundance in early S phase,
declines to a very low level by the end of S phase and G2/M, and begins to increase in
abundance in G1, even though the amount of histone H3 is relatively constant throughout
the cell cycle (Figures 4D and 4E). We also observed abundant hMSH6 foci and their partial
(~80%) colocalization with H3K36me3 in G1 phase (Figure S1C). Together, these results
suggest that H3K36me3 recruits hMutSα to chromatin in vivo before and during early S
phase, which could increase the efficiency of MMR in actively replicating chromatin.
Although the interaction between hMSH6 and chromatin appears to be facilitated by
H3K36me3, not all hMSH6 foci colocalize with H3K36me3 foci in S-phase HeLa cells
(Figures 4B). These results may suggest one or both of the following possibilities: 1) not all
H3K36me3 marks recruit hMutSα; and 2) after binding, hMutSα disassociates from
H3K36me3 during DNA replication, possibly due to specific interactions with the
replication machinery, as previously reported (Hombauer et al., 2011a; Kleczkowska et al.,
2001) (see Discussion for more details).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further determine that the H3K36me3-PWWP interaction is specific for recruiting
hMSH6, we measured nuclear distribution of the hMSH3 subunit of hMutSβ and its
colocalization with H3K36me3. We show that hMSH3, which lacks a PWWP domain, does
not interact with H3K36me3 and its nuclear localization is independent of H3K36me3
(Figure S2), consistent with the notion that human cells utilize different mechanisms for
hMutSα and hMutSβ recruitments (Hong et al., 2008).
HeLa cells with SETD2 knockdown display a mutator phenotype
As suggested above, if the hMSH6-H3K36me3 interaction recruits hMutSα to chromatin in
vivo, then it could be essential for MMR in vivo. If this prediction is correct, cells lacking or
depleted for H3K36me3 will be MMR-deficient and have an increased mutation frequency.
To explore this prediction, control and SETD2-depleted HeLa cells were tested for MSI at
four microsatellite loci as described (Parsons et al., 1993). The results (Figure 5A) show no
MSI in control HeLa cells, while 4 out of 14 (28.6%) subclones from SETD2/H3K36me3depleted HeLa cells showed either new microsatellite species (asterisk) or deletion of a
microsatellite mark (Δ). As a positive control, MSI was also analyzed in hMSH6-deficient
DLD-1 cells, and the results show new repeat species in 6 out of 15 (40%) subclones (Figure
S3). Despite a difference in the percentage of subclones showing new repeat species, the
data clearly demonstrate that like hMSH6-deficient DLD-1 cells, SETD2/H3K36me3depleted HeLa cells display MSI.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further confirm the mutator phenotype in SETD2/H3K36me3-depleted cells, we
measured the spontaneous forward mutation frequency in the hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene (Kat et al., 1993) in SETD2/H3K36me3-depleted
and control HeLa cells. As shown in Figure 5B, the spontaneous mutation frequency in
SETD2/H3K36me3-depleted HeLa cells had an 18-fold increase (1.2 × 10−5, p<0.05)
compared to that in control HeLa cells (6.9 × 10−7), indicating that SETD2/H3K36me3
depletion causes a mutator phenotype. When the same analysis was performed in hMSH6deficient shSETD2-DLD-1 and control DLDL-1 cells, the mutation frequency essentially
remained unchanged (Figure 5B). This result suggests that SETD2 depletion only alters the
mutation frequency in hMSH6-competent cells, which is consistent with the idea that
H3K36me3 recruits hMutSα. Interestingly, the mutation frequency in SETD2/H3K36me3depleted HeLa cells is ~10-fold lower than that in hMSH6-deficient DLD-1 cells, which is
likely due to both the efficiency of SETD2 depletion and the huge difference in the total

passage number between these two cells. In addition, H3K36me3 may not be the only
mechanism for hMSH6 recruitment.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine if SETD2/H3K36me3 modulates the enzymatic function(s) of MMR proteins,
the in vitro MMR activity of SETD2/H3K36me3-depleted HeLa cells was examined.
Consistent with our model (see below), these cells are not defective in MMR in vitro (Figure
5C). This observation indicates that SETD2 and H3K36me3 are not physically involved in
MMR, and that depletion of SETD2/H3K36me3 does not alter the expression or function of
MMR genes.
Cancer cells deficient in SETD2 display MSI and fail to recruit hMutSα to chromatin

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Recent studies identified SETD2 as a tumor suppressor for clear cell renal cell carcinoma
(ccRCC) (Dalgliesh et al., 2010; Duns et al., 2010; Gerlinger et al., 2012; Varela et al.,
2011), but the mechanism linking SETD2 deficiency to ccRCC tumorigenesis remains
unknown. We hypothesize that defective MMR may contribute to tumorigenesis in SETD2deficient ccRCC patients. To test this hypothesis, we screened several ccRCC cell lines for
SETD2 mutations and identified a SETD2-deficient ccRCC cell line, UOK143, which
carries A5197 →G and T5306 →C mutations, leading to N1734D and S1769P amino acid
substitutions in SETD2, respectively (Figure S4A). Western blot analysis shows that
UOK143 cells express undetectable amounts of SETD2, which is readily detected in the
SETD2-proficient ccRCC cell line, UOK121 (Figure 6A). As expected, the amount of
H3K36me3 is much lower in UOK143 cells than in UOK121 cells (Figure 6A). We then
analyzed the distribution of hMSH6 and H3K36me3 in these ccRCC cells. H3K36me3 was
barely detectable in UOK143 cells by immunofluorescence, but was relatively more
abundant in UOK121 cells (Figure 6B). Correspondingly, in S-phase UOK121 cells,
hMSH6 foci were abundant and partially (~70%) colocalized with H3K36me3, while
significantly fewer and smaller hMSH6 foci were observed in S-phase UOK143 cells
(Figures 6B and 6C), which is similar to what was observed in SETD2/H3K36me3-depleted
HeLa (Figure 4B) and DLD-1 (Figure 3E) cells. As noted previously, these results suggest
that H3K36me3 facilitates localization of hMSH6 (hMutSα) to chromatin.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine if the failure to recruit hMutSα confers an MMR-deficient phenotype to
UOK143 cells, we examined MSI in UOK143 and UOK121 cells. The results revealed no
MSI in UOK121 cells and that UOK143 cells exhibited mono- and di-nucleotide repeat
instability, as all subclones, except clone 1, exhibit either new repeat species or deletion of a
microsatellite marker (Figure 6D). To rule out the possibility that UOK143 cells carry a
defective MMR component, we measured in vitro MMR activity of UOK143 and UOK121,
observing the same normal levels of MMR activity and proteins in extracts from both cell
lines (data not shown). These results suggest that MSI in UOK143 cells is caused by loss of
SETD2 activity, not loss of MMR capacity.
We previously characterized a Burkitt’s lymphoma cell line, NAMALWA, that displays
MSI but is proficient in MMR in vitro (Gu et al., 2002). We therefore analyzed if this cell
line is defective in SETD2. The result shows that NAMALWA cells carry a heterozygous
deletion of exon 8 in SETD2 (Figure S4B), which also alters the reading frame of the gene.
Consistent with this result, NAMALWA cells express a much lower level of SETD2 and
have a lower level of H3K36me3 than SETD2-proficient cells such as NALM6 cells (Figure
S4C). These observations suggest that depletion of H3K36me3 promotes ccRCC and could
play a role in promoting other cancers (see Discussion).

Restoration of H3K36me3 in SETD2-deficient cells restores hMutSα chromatin localization

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further confirm that H3K36me3 facilitates recruitment of hMutSα onto chromatin, we
transiently transfected UOK143 cells with the yeast Set2 gene, which is known to efficiently
promote H3K36 trimethylation in human cells (Luco et al., 2010). Compared with control
cells transfected with an empty vector, Set2-expressing UOK143 cells exhibited higher
levels of H3K36me3, larger and more hMSH6 foci, and partial colocalization of H3K36me3
and hMSH6. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that H3K36me3 recruits
hMutSα onto chromatin in vivo.

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that H3K36me3 recruits hMutSα to chromatin in a cell cycledependent manner, such that H3K36me3 and the histone methyltransferase SETD2 are
required for MMR in vivo. The finding provides a molecular explanation for the lack of
concurrence between the MSI phenotype and the MMR genotype among human cancer
cells.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although human MMR has been reconstituted in vitro (Constantin et al., 2005; Zhang et al.,
2005), little is known how the MMR machinery operates on chromatin in vivo. The
identification of the hMSH6 PWWP domain as a reader of H3K36me3 prompted us to
hypothesize that H3K36me3 recruits hMutSα via this domain onto chromatin. We show
here that 1) wild type but not mutant hMSH6 PWWP domain interacts with H3K36me3containing histone octamers (Figure 2); 2) the hMSH6 PWWP domain is essential for
hMutSα chromatin localization (Figure 3B); 3) cells depleted with H3K36me3 fail to recruit
hMutSα (Figures 3D, 4B, and 6B); 4) restoration of the H3K36me3 signal also restores
hMutSα chromatin localization in SETD2-deficient cells (Figure 6E); and 5) SETD2/
H3K36me3-depleted cells display an MMR-deficient mutator phenotype (Figures 5 and 6D).
Therefore, H3K36me3 and the PWWP domain regulate human MMR in vivo.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In support of this conclusion, the abundance of hMSH6 (and hMutSα) foci in the nucleus of
HeLa cells correlates with the abundance of H3K36me3 during the cell cycle. The level of
H3K36me3 is highest in the early S phase, significantly declines in the middle S phase, and
little remains in late S phase and G2/M (Figure 4D), consistent with published results
(Bonenfant et al., 2007; Ryba et al., 2010). Correspondingly, hMSH6 foci are readily seen in
S phase, but are rarely seen in G2/M (Figure 4C). These results suggest that MMR is mainly
active in S phase, when it corrects DNA replication-associated nucleotide misincorporations
(Hombauer et al., 2011a; Hombauer et al., 2011b; Simmons et al., 2008), but that hMutSα is
likely recruited to chromatin before DNA replication initiates. This appears to be consistent
with a recent yeast study. Despite that yeast MSH6 does not possess a PWWP domain, and
is probably not recruited to chromatin by H3K36me3, Hombauer et al. (Hombauer et al.,
2011a) showed that yeast MutSα is present at the replication fork, independent of the
presence of mispaired bases. However, we provide evidence that localizing hMutSα to
chromatin, although essential for MMR in vivo, is not sufficient to trigger or facilitate the
biochemical reaction of MMR in the context of chromatin, as judged by the fact that a
mismatch located between two histone octamers bearing the H3K36me3 signature could not
be corrected by MMR-competent nuclear extracts (Figure S5), which also contain all
chromatin remodeling/modifying factors. This observation suggests that the hMutSα
recruitment to chromatin by H3K36me3 only sets up an on-call system for MMR, which is
ready whenever it is needed, but triggering the MMR reaction needs both specific mismatch
signal and an environment of DNA replication, which in part includes disassembly of
nucleosome structure.

Based on previously published data and the results presented here, we propose a model for
the initiation of MMR in human cells in vivo (Figure 7). First, the SETD2 methyltransferase
converts H3K36me2 to H3K36me3 either before or in early S phase. Then, H3K36me3
helps recruit hMutSα onto chromatin through its interaction with the hMSH6 PWWP
domain. During DNA replication, nucleosomes are dynamically assembled and
disassembled, such that nucleosomes ahead of the replication fork are disrupted and those
behind the replication fork are rapidly re-assembled (Ransom et al., 2010). Nucleosome
disassembly provides the replication machinery access to DNA, and at the same time,
disrupts the H3K36me3-PWWP interaction, thereby releasing hMutSα from histone
octamers. The released hMutSα can then readily attach to temporarily histone-free nascent
DNA through its strong DNA binding activity and/or by interacting with PCNA via the
hMSH6 PIP (PCNA interacting protein) box (Clark et al., 2000; Flores-Rozas et al., 2000).
hMutSα then slides along the DNA helix (Gorman et al., 2007; Gradia et al., 1997; Mendillo
et al., 2005) to locate mispairs, which triggers downstream events in the MMR pathway.
However, mismatches assembled in the nascent nucleosomes behind the replication fork will
not be repaired (Figure S5).

It is worth mentioning that both the human and yeast MSH6 PIP boxes have been shown to
be required for MutSα colocalization with replication factories (Hombauer et al., 2011a;
Kleczkowska et al., 2001). Interestingly, depletion of the PIP box only moderately (~10–
15%) reduces MMR activity in yeast (Hombauer et al., 2011a; Shell et al., 2007) and does
not abolish hMSH6 foci formation in human cells (Kleczkowska et al., 2001). These
observations indicate that PIP-defective MutSα can still be efficiently recruited to
chromatin. We therefore propose that in human cells, the hMSH6 PIP box and PWWP
domain are likely to play different but complementary roles in MMR. One possibility is that
the PWWP domain localizes hMutSα to H3K36me3-containing chromatin before
replication initiates and then the PIP box helps localize hMutSα to newly-formed mispairs
through its interaction with PCNA during DNA replication. This could also explain the
presence of a fraction of hMSH6 foci that do not colocalize with H3K36me3 foci in S phase
(Figures 4B, 6B, 6E and S1). Further investigations are needed to explore this and other
possibilities.

The data presented here suggest that tumors defective in SETD2 fail to recruit hMutSα to
chromatin and therefore are MMR-deficient in vivo. Recently, a number of exome
sequencing studies have identified SETD2 mutations in ccRCC (Dalgliesh et al., 2010; Duns
et al., 2010; Gerlinger et al., 2012; Varela et al., 2011), lung cancer (Govindan et al., 2012;
Imielinski et al., 2012), and hematological maliganencies (Zhang et al., 2012). These
SETD2-deficient cancers have no detectable mutations in MMR genes; however, results
presented here are consistent with the idea that SETD2 mutations are responsible for an
MMR-defect in these cells. Notably, all SETD2-deficient ccRCC tumors have a high
frequency of small insertion/deletion mutations and dominant single-nucleotide substitutions
(Dalgliesh et al., 2010; Gerlinger et al., 2012), which are hallmarks of MMR deficiency. In
addition, a subset of gastric cancers that display MSI have no mutations in known MMR
genes, but are defective in SETD2 (Wang et al., 2011). A similar situation may exist in some
MSI-positive colorectal cancer cells (Peltomaki, 2003).
H3K36me3 interacts with multiple PWWP-containing proteins in vivo, and the importance
of H3K36me3 in transcriptional regulation is well documented (Musselman et al., 2012).
How is the dual impact of H3K36me3 on MMR and transcription regulated or partitioned?
Because MMR is not active in G1, it remains to be investigated if the observed hMSH6H3K36me3 interaction in G1 (Figure S1B) facilitates transcription or occurs just before cells
enter S phase (note that double-thymidine treatment arrests the cell cycle at the G1-S
boundary). Since MMR is coupled to DNA replication, MMR and transcription could only

compete with one another for H3K36me3 during S phase. Although an as-yet-unknown
mechanism may avoid such competition, Wansink et al. (Wansink et al., 1994) have already
shown that transcription and replication rarely occur at the same time in the same place in Sphase nuclei. If universally true, then there is little risk of conflict between roles for
H3K36me3 in MMR and transcription.
In summary, we demonstrate here that H3K36me3 regulates MMR in vivo. This striking
finding underscores the importance of the histone code in maintaining genome stability.
Recent studies reveal that mutation rates in cancer genomes are closely related to histone
modification-directed chromatin organization (Schuster-Bockler and Lehner, 2012). In that
regard, future studies may reveal that the abundance of H3K36me3 in a gene or gene
regulatory region plays a role in determining the mutability of that segment of the human
genome.

Experimental procedures
Cell lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

HeLa, NALM6 and NAMALWA cells were grown in RPMI1640 medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). UOK121, UOK143 and DLD-1 cells were maintained
in DMEM with 10% FBS. The stable SETD2-knockdown HeLa (shSETD2-HeLa) and
SETD2 knockdown DLD-1 lines were created by lentivirus (Sigma) transfection under
puromycin selection, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Protein and peptide preparations
Human wild type and mutant MutSα proteins were expressed and purified as described
(Zhang et al., 2005). The hMSH6 gene used for mutagenesis was a gift of Dr. Richard
Kolodner. For expression of GST-PWWP fusion peptides, wild type and mutant PWWP
domain fragments of hMSH6 were PCR-amplified and cloned into pGEX4T2 (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences). After verification by sequencing, the resulting plasmids were
used for protein expression and purification from an E. coli Rosetta (DE3) strain (Novagen).
Recombinant H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 were obtained and histone octamers were assembled as
described (Li et al., 2009). Native histone octamers were isolated from HeLa cells as
described (Rodriguez-Collazo et al., 2009). EGFP-hMSH6 expression vector (pEGFP-C1hMSH6, a gift of Dr. Akira Yasui) was used to generate the expression vectors of EGFPhMSH6-PAAP, EGFP-hMSH6-Y103A, and EGFP-hMSH6-F133A. Histone H3 peptides
(ARKSAPATGGVK36KPHRYRP) containing various forms of K36 methylation were
commercially synthesized (GenScript, Piscataway, New Jersey).

MSI and HPRT mutability analyses
For each cell line tested for MSI, independent single cell colonies were isolated in 96-well
microtiter plates and genomic DNA was isolated. Four microsatellite markers (BAT25,
BAT26, D2S123, D5S346) were used to for MSI analysis (Parsons et al., 1993).
The HPRT mutation assay was conducted as described (Kat et al., 1993). Cells (5×105) were
seeded in triplicate 100-mm Petri dishes for 12 h and fed with complete medium containing
5 μM freshly prepared 6-thioguanine (6-TG). The plating efficiency was determined by
culturing 5×102 cells similarly in the absence of 6-TG. After culturing a 10 day-culturing,
cell colonies were visualized by staining with 0.05% crystal violet. The mutation frequency
was determined by dividing the number of 6-TG resistant colonies by the total number of
cells plated after being corrected for the colony-forming ability.

Cell synchronization and cell cycle analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cell synchronization was performed as described (Stojic et al., 2004). Cells were arrested at
G1/S by culturing for 18 h in complete medium containing 2 mM thymidine, 10 h in
thymidine-free medium, and then thymidine-containing medium for an additional 15 h
before release into complete medium. Cells were harvested at 0 h (G1 phase), 1 h (early S),
2.5 h (middle S), 4h (late S), and 8h (G2/M). Cell cycle status was confirmed by flow
cytometry.
Microscopy and immunofluorescence analysis
Immunofluorescence analysis was performed essentially as described (Kleczkowska et al.,
2001). Fluorescence images were obtained and analyzed using an FV-1000 Olympus
confocal scanning laser microscopy system. The percentage of colocalized H3K36me3 and
hMSH6 foci was quantified using the Olympus FV10-ASW2.1 software, based on analyzing
the Pearson correlation coefficient as described (Adler and Parmryd, 2010).
Mismatch repair assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In vitro MMR assays were performed as described (Holmes et al., 1990; Zhang et al., 2005).
Unless otherwise specified, MMR activity was determined in a 20-μL reaction containing
50 μg of nuclear extracts, 100 ng of a circular DNA substrate containing a G-T mismatch in
the presence or absence of hMutSα. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min, and
repair was scored and analyzed by restriction enzyme digestions and agarose gel
electrophoresis.
Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays
Antibodies used in this study were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (MSH2, MSH3, histone
H3, GST and tubulin), BD Biosciences (MSH6), Sigma (SETD2), and Cell Signaling
Technology (SETD2 and H3K36me3).
Statistical analysis
All statistical assays, Student’s t-test and One-way analysis of variance (ANOV) with
Tukey’s multiple comparison, were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad
Software, Inc.). Data were considered statistically significant if p-values were less than 0.05
or 0.001, as indicated.

Figure 1. The PWWP domain and structural models for interaction with H3K36me3

(A) Domain structure of hMSH6 and sequence alignment of PWWP modules. Upper panel
shows the domain structure of hMSH6. PIP, PCNA-interacting protein motif; NLS, nuclear
localization signal. Lower panel shows alignment of representative human PWWP domains.
The blue dots indicate residues that form an aromatic cage and bind to H3K36me3. Aligned
proteins are hMSH6, BRPF1, WHSC1_N, WHSC1_C, ZDWPW1, and HDGF.
(B) Interactions between PWWP domains and the H3K36me3-containing H3 peptide. The
crystal structure of BRPF1 PWWP domain bound to the H3K36me3 peptide (PDB: 2X4Y)
is shown in the left panel. BRPF1 does not have the Trp residues and instead contains a
PSYP sequence (shown in yellow). The structure of the hMSH6 PWWP domain, which has
the authentic PWWP motif, was determined by NMR (Laguri et al., 2008) in the absence of
an H3 peptide (PDB: 2GFU). The H3 peptide in the BRPF1 complex is shown with human
hMSH6 (right panel) after superimposing the conserved PWWP domains of the two
proteins. The aromatic cage (colored blue) encloses the trimethylated Lys. The rotamer
conformations of W106 and F133 in hMSH6 likely have to adjust upon binding of the
H3K36me3.

Figure 2. The MSH6 PWWP domain interacts with histone octamers containing H3K36me3

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) GST pull-down assay for interaction of wild type GST-PWWP peptide with native
histone octamer (purified from HeLa cells) or recombinant histone octamer. Unless
otherwise mentioned, octamer marked with asterisk in this figure was detected by staining
with Coomassie blue, and proteins not marked were detected by silver staining or Western
blot using antibodies against the indicated components.
(B) GST pull-down assay for interaction between the native histone octamer and
recombinant wild type (WT) or mutant (PAAP) PWWP peptide.
(C) hMutSα pull-down assay by biotin-labeled H3 peptides containing various forms of
methylation in K36, as indicated. Bound hMutSα was eluted and detected by an hMSH6
antibody. Relative hMutSα binding was determined using the level of hMutSα in the
K36me3 peptide-containing reaction as a reference.
(D) Interaction of H3 peptide containing K36me3 with hMutSα with wild type or a mutant
PWWP domain, as indicated. The experiment was performed as in (C).
(E) Recombinant histone H3 with a chemically installed analog of tri-methyllysine at
position 36 (H3Kc36me3/Kc36me3) forms histone octamers with other histone proteins
(i.e., H2A, H2B, and H4) as efficient as recombinant wild type histone H3 (K36).
(F) Co-immunoprecipitation of histone octamer containing H3Kc36me3 and hMutSα with
wild type (WT) or mutant (PAAP) PWWP domain. hMSH2 antibody was used for
pulldown. The presence of H3Kc36me3 in the pulldown was detected using an H3K36me3specific antibody.

PWWP domain in hMSH6-deficient DLD-1 cells in S phase.
(C) Number of hMSH6 foci per nucleus in DLD-1 cells transfected with EGFP-hMSH6
containing WT or a mutant PWWP domain. The “n” value indicates the total number of
nuclei analyzed in a given case. The error bars represent SD.
(D) Western blot analysis showing the expression of the indicated proteins in DLD-1 cells
stably transfected with a scrambled shRNA (control) or a SETD2-specific shRNA.

Figure 7. Model for hMutSα recruitment to chromatin and mismatched DNA

In the late G1 and/or early S phase, SETD2 converts H3K36me2 to H3K36me3. H3K36me3
recruits hMutSα onto chromatin via its interaction with the hMSH6 PWWP domain before
DNA replication initiates. During DNA replication, Nucleosome disassembly exposes naked
DNA to the replication machinery and also disrupts the H3K36me3-PWWP interaction,
which releases hMutSα from histone octamers. hMutSα, which has a strong DNA binding
activity, can readily bind to nascent DNA with or without an interaction with PCNA. Once a
mismatch is introduced, hMutSα can quickly identify the mismatch to initiate the MMR
reaction. Also see Fig. S5.
