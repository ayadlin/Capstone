Author Manuscript

MicroRNAs are often associated with the pathogenesis of many cancers including Head and Neck
Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). In particular, microRNA-21 (miR-21) appears to play a
critical role in tumor cell survival, chemoresistance and HNSCC progression. In this study we
investigated matrix hyaluronan (HA)-induced CD44 (a primary HA receptor) interaction with the
stem cell markers, Nanog and Stat-3, in HNSCC cells (HSC-3 cells). Our results indicate that HA
binding to CD44 promotes Nanog-Stat-3 (also tyrosine phosphorylated Stat-3) complex formation,
nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. Further analyses reveal that miR-21 is
controlled by an upstream promoter containing Stat-3 binding site(s), while chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrate that stimulation of miR-21 expression by HA/
CD44 signaling is Nanog/Stat-3-dependent in HNSCC cells. This process results in a decrease of a
tumor suppressor protein (PDCD4), and an upregulation of inhibitors of the apoptosis family of
proteins (IAPs) as well as chemoresistance in HSC-3 cells. Treatment of HSC-3 cells with Nanogand/or Stat-3-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) effectively blocks HA-mediated NanogStat-3 signaling events, abrogates miR-21 production and increases PDCD4 expression.
Subsequently, this Nanog-Stat-3 signaling inhibition causes downregulation of survival protein
(IAP) expression and enhancement of chemosensitivity. To further evaluate the role of miR-21 in
tumor cell-specific functions, HSC-3 cells were also transfected with a specific anti-miR-21
inhibitor in order to silence miR-21 expression and block its target functions. Our results
demonstrate that anti-miR-21 inhibitor not only upregulates PDCD4 expression, but also decreases
IAP expression and enhances chemosensitivity in HA-treated HNSCC cells. Together, these
findings indicate that the HA-induced CD44 interaction with Nanog and Stat-3 plays a pivotal role
in miR-21 production leading to PDCD4 reduction, IAP upregulation and chemoresistance in
HNSCC cells. This novel Nanog/Stat-3 signaling pathway-specific mechanism involved in

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a malignancy that involves cancers of
the lip, oral cavity, pharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, nose, nasal, sinuses, neck, ears and
salivary glands (Parkin, et al., 2005). Advanced HNSCC is an aggressive disease associated
with major morbidity and mortality. The three-year survival rate for patients with advancedstage HNSCC treated with standard therapy is only 30 to 50%. Resistance to standard
therapy continues to be a limiting factor in the treatment of HNSCC. Nearly 40 to 60% of
HNSCC patients subsequently develop chemoresistance, locoregional recurrences or distant
metastases (Jemal, et al. 2008; Parkin, et al. 2005). Thus, clarification of key aspects of
tumor cell functions underlying the clinical behavior of HNSCC is greatly needed.

Author Manuscript

Previous studies identified specific extracellular matrix (ECM) components in head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) that correlate with tumor cell behaviors (Wang and
Bourguignon, 2011). Among such candidate molecules is hyaluronan (HA) which is a
nonsulfated, unbranched glycosaminoglycan consisting of repeating disaccharide units, Dglucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (Toole and Hascall, 2002). HA interacts with
CD44, a family of cell-surface glycoprotein receptors which are also expressed in a variety
of human solid neoplasms, particularly those classified as HNSCC (Wang, et al., 2009).
Both CD44 and HA are overexpressed/elevated at sites of tumor attachment (Toole and
Hascall, 2002; Toole, et al., 2002). HA binding to CD44 not only affects cell adhesion to
extracellular matrix (ECM) components, but also is involved in the stimulation of a variety
of tumor cell-specific functions leading to cytoskeleton function and HNSCC progression
(Turley, et al., 2002; Bourguignon, 2008). However, the oncogenic mechanism(s) occurring
during HA-activated and CD44-specific HNSCC progression remain(s) to be determined.

The stem cell marker, Nanog is an important transcription factor involved in the selfrenewal and maintenance of pluripotency in the inner cell mass (ICM) of mammalian
embryo and of embryonic stem (ES) cells (Mitsui, et al., 2003). Nanog signaling is regulated
by interactions among various pluripotent stem cell regulators (e.g., Rex1, Sox2 and Oct3/4)
which together control the expression of a set of target genes required for ES cell
pluripotency (Mitsui, et al., 2003). These findings confirm the essential role of Nanog in
regulating a variety of cellular functions. Recently, several tumor cell types have been
shown to express Nanog (Ezeh, et al., 2005; Bourguignon, et al., 2008). HA binding to
epithelial tumor cells has been shown to promote Nanog protein association with CD44,
followed by Nanog activation and the expression of pluripotent stem cell regulators (e.g.,
Rex1 and Sox2) (Bourguignon, et al., 2008). These findings strongly suggest that HA/CD44
signaling and Nanog function are tightly linked.

The “signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3” (Stat-3) was initially
identified as APRF (Acute Phase Response Factor), an inducible DNA binding protein that
binds to the IL-6-responsive element within the promoters of hepatic acute phase genes
(Darnell, 1997, Heinrich, et al., 2003). Accumulating evidence indicates that Stat-3 also
plays an important role in regulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival (Huang,
2007). Nanog and Stat-3 also appear to be both structurally linked and functionally coupled
in HA/CD44 signaling during epithelial tumor cell activation (Bourguignon, et al., 2008).
The question of whether Nanog and Stat-3 are interacting with each other in HNSCC cells
will be addressed in this study.

A number of studies indicate that more than 50% of microRNA [(miRNA), small RNA
molecules with ~20–25 nucleotides] are located in cancer-related genomic regions or fragile
sites, suggesting that miRNA may be closely associated with the pathogenesis of a variety of
cancers including HNSCC (Chang, et al., 2008; Volinia, et al., 2006). Analysis of an array
profile of miRNA expression in HNSCC tissues reveals that miR-21 is abundantly produced
in these tumors compared to normal tissues (Volinia, et al., 2006). The functional
significance of miR-21 has been elucidated in several recent studies following the discovery
of its specific targets (Asangani, et al., 2008), making miR-21 one of the most-studied
miRNAs due to its involvement in cancer progression. Importantly, miR-21 plays a role in
the inhibition of tumor suppressor proteins such as Program Cell Death 4 (PDCD4), via a
conserved site within the 3′-UTR (3′-untranslated region) of the mRNA (Asangani, et al.,
2008; Bourguignon, et al., 2009a). Downregulation of PDCD4 expression by miR-21 leads
to tumor cell growth, survival, chemoresistance, invasion and metastasis (Bourguignon, et
al., 2009a). Thus, miR-21 is currently considered to be an oncogenic miRNA. Whether HA/
CD44-mediated Nanog (or Stat-3) signaling is involved in regulating oncogenic miRNA
(e.g., miR-21) expression/function and tumor-specific behaviors in HNSCC cells has not
been determined, and represents the primary focus of this study.

In this study we discovered a new matrix HA/CD44-mediated Nanog/Stat-3 signaling
mechanism that regulates miR-21 production and chemoresistance in HNSCC cells.
Specifically, our results indicate that HA/CD44 activates Nanog-Stat-3 signaling which, in
turn, stimulates miR-21 expression and function. These events lead to the reduction of the
tumor suppressor protein, PDCD4, upregulation of survival proteins and cisplatin
chemoresistance in HNSCC cells. Inhibition of either Nanog/Stat-3 signaling or silencing
miR-21 expression/function not only results in PDCD4 upregulation, but also causes a
reduction of survival protein expression and an enhancement of chemosensitivity to
cisplatin. Thus, our findings strongly support the contention that Nanog, Stat-3, and miR-21
form a functional signaling axis that regulates tumor cell survival and cisplatin
chemoresistance in HNSCC cells.

RESULTS
HA-mediated CD44 interaction with Nanog and Stat-3 in HSC-3 Cells
Previous studies showed that both Nanog and Stat-3 are functionally coupled during
oncogenesis (Bourguignon, et al., 2008). Among the signaling aberrations present in
HNSCC, Stat-3 activation appears to be one of the critical pathways in HNSCC

development and progression (Song and Grandis, 2000). Cellular transformation by Stat-3
generally requires specific phosphorylation of the tyrosine 705(pY705) residue (Wen, et al.,
1995). In this study we first examined whether Nanog and Stat-3 are expressed in clinical
HNSCC tissue specimens. Primary HNSCC tumors were immunostained with antibodies for
Nanog, total Stat-3 and tyrosine phosphorylated Stat-3. Fig. 1A shows representative
examples of the immunohistochemical staining of HNSCC primary tumors for both Nanog
and Stat-3 (Fig. 1A-a & b). We have also observed co-localization of Nanog with tyrosine
phosphorylated Stat-3 and total Stat-3 (Fig. 1A-c-e and Fig. 1A-f-h) in HNSCC patient
samples. These findings clearly demonstrated that a close association between Nanog and
Stat-3 (including tyrosine phosphorylated Stat-3) occurs in head and neck cancer patient
samples.

HA/CD44-mediated oncogenic signaling has been implicated in both the initiation and
development of several solid tumors including head and neck cancer (Bourguignon, et al.,
2008, 2009a; Huang, 2007; Toole and Hascall, 2002; Wang, et al., 2009; Wang and
Bourguignon, 2011). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which HA/CD44
signaling occurs in HNSCC cells are still poorly understood. In this study we have focused
on the question of whether there is a physical linkage between CD44 and tyrosine
phosphorylated Stat-3[pY705] in HNSCC cells [e.g., HSC-3 cell line (Fig. 1)]. To this end
we performed a HA-mediated Stat-3 tyrosine phosphorylation time course (e.g., 0, 5, 15 and
60min) using anti-CD44-mediated immunoprecipitation followed by anti-Stat-3[pY705]
immunoblot or anti-CD44 immunoblot, respectively. Our results indicate that the association
of phosphorylated Stat-3 with CD44 occurs as early as 5min following HA addition to
HNSCC cells (Fig. 1B).

Next, we investigated whether there is an interaction between Nanog and total Stat-3 in the
CD44-associated signaling complex in HNSCC cells [e.g., HSC-3 cells (Fig. 1C)].
Specifically, we performed anti-CD44-mediated immunoprecipitation followed by antiNanog immunoblot or anti-total Stat-3/anti-Stat-3[pY705] immunoblot or anti-CD44
immunoblot (Fig. 1C), respectively, using cells treated with HA or without HA. Our results
indicate that a 5min HA treatment causes the recruitment of Nanog and total Stat-3 (together
with tyrosine phosphorylated Stat-3) (Fig. 1C-a,b, c) into the CD44 complex (Fig. 1C-d). In
contrast, a low level of Nanog or Stat-3 (or tyrosine phosphorylated Stat-3) is present in the
anti-CD44-immunoprecipitated materials (reblotted with anti-CD44) in cells not treated with
HA (Fig. 1C-a, b, c, d) or in cells pretreated with anti-CD44 antibody followed by a 5min
HA treatment (Fig. 1C-a, b, c, d). These findings clearly establish that CD44, Nanog and
Stat-3 (in particular, tyrosine phosphorylated Stat-3) are closely associated with each other,
and that there is a significant increase in the recruitment of Nanog, Stat-3 (also
phosphorylated Stat-3) into the CD44-associated complex following a 5min HA treatment of
HSC-3 cells.

(Bourguignon, et al. 2008Bourguignon, et al. 2009a and 2010). In this study using
immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy, we observed that both Nanog and
Stat-3 can be translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus after 15 min HA treatment (Fig.
2A). In contrast, the majority of Nanog and Stat-3 is distributed in the cytosol and only a
low level of Nanog and Stat-3 is present in the nucleus of HSC-3 cells, either pretreated with
anti-CD44 antibody plus HA (Fig. 2A) or without any HA treatment (Fig. 2A). These
observations indicate that HA-CD44 interaction promotes Nanog and Stat-3 nuclear
translocation in HNSCC cells.

Author Manuscript

In order to examine whether Nanog interacts with Stat-3 (in particular tyrosine
phosphorylated Stat-3) directly in the nucleus of HSC-3 cells, we analyzed the anti-Nanogmediated immunoprecipitates from nuclear extracts by immunoblotting with anti-total
Stat-3/anti-p-Stat-3[pY705], or anti-Nanog antibody, respectively. Our results demonstrate
that very little amount of Nanog is complexed with either total Stat-3 or tyrosine
phosphorylated Stat-3 in the nuclear fractions of HSC-3 cells without any HA treatment
(Fig. 2B-a, b, c). Importantly, we observed that a 15 min HA treatment of HSC-3 cells
stimulates a measurable increase in the amount of Nanog and total Stat-3/tyrosine
phosphorylated Stat-3 complexes (Fig. 2B-a, b, c) in the nuclear fractions of HSC-3 cells.
When these tumor cells were pretreated with anti-CD44 antibody followed by a 15min HA
treatment, the complex formation between Nanog and total Stat-3/tyrosine phosphorylated
Stat-3 in the nuclear fraction is greatly reduced in HSC-3 cells (Fig. 2B-a, b, c). These
findings suggest that Nanog is capable of forming with Stat-3 (in particular, tyrosine
phosphorylated Stat-3) (in the nucleus) in a HA-dependent and CD44-specific manner in
HSC-3 cells.

Role of Stat-3 in regulating miR-21 expression in HA/CD44 and Nanog-activated HSC-3
cells

(1) In vivo binding of Stat-3 to the upstream/enhancer region of the miR-21
promoter in HSC-3 cells—A previous study indicated that the gene encoding oncogenic
miR-21 is regulated by an upstream/enhancer promoter containing Stat-3 binding sites
(Löffler D, 2007). To examine whether Nanog-associated Stat-3 directly interacts with the
upstream/enhancer region of miR-21 promoter, anti-Stat-3 antibody-, anti-phosphoStat-3[pY705] and anti-Nanog antibody-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assays were performed in HSC-3 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, the PCR from both anti-Stat-3,
anti-phospho-Stat-3[pY705] and anti-Nanog-mediated precipitations from HA-treated HSC-3
cells resulted in a specific amplification product using primer pair specific for the miR-21
promoter/enhancer region containing the Stat-3 binding sites (Fig. 3A-a, b, c, lane 2). In
contrast, reduced amount of Nanog is associated with the Stat-3 or phospho-Stat-3 binding
of miR-21 upstream/enhancer promoter region in cells pretreated with anti-CD44 antibody
followed by HA addition (Fig. 3A-a,b,c, lane 3), or without HA treatment (Fig. 3a,b,c, lane
1). These findings suggest that the recruitment of Stat-3 (also phospho-Stat-3) and Nanog
into the upstream/enhancer region of miR-21 promoter site is HA-specific and CD44dependent.

To confirm the direct involvement of Stat-3 and Nanog in miR-21 gene upregulation, both
Stat-3 and Nanog were first downregulated by Stat-3 siRNA or Nanog siRNA, respectively
followed by the miR-21 promoter-specific ChIP assay as described above. Our results
indicate that transfection of HNSCC cells with Nanog siRNAs (Fig. 3A-a,b,c, lane 6) or
Stat-3 siRNA (Fig. 3A-a,b,c, lane 7), but not scrambled sequenced siRNA (Fig. 3A-a,b,c,
lane 4 vs. lane 5) effectively blocks HA-mediated Nanog/Stat-3 binding to the miR-21
upstream/enhancer promoter region in HNSCC cells. Identical amplification products were
detected in the positive controls from total input chromatin (Fig. 3A-e, lane 1–7). Moreover,
no amplification was seen in samples that were processed in IgG isotype control-mediated
precipitation (Fig. 3A-d, lane 1–7). We observed similar results by quantitative RT-PCR
(data not shown). Thus, these results verify that Nanog-associated Stat-3 binds directly (or
forms as part of the complex) to the promoter region of miR-21 in HSC-3 cells following
HA-CD44 interaction.

Author Manuscript

In order to establish the specificity of the Stat-3/Nanog siRNAs used in this study, HSC-3
cells were transfected with siRNA sequences targeting human Nanog or Stat-3 followed by
immunoblotting with anti-Stat-3 antibody or anti-Nanog antibody, respectively. Our results
clearly indicate that Stat-3 siRNA target sequences successfully suppress the expression of
Stat-3 (but not Nanog) in HNSCC cells (Fig. 3B-a,b,c), whereas Nanog siRNA target
sequences effectively block Nanog (but not Stat-3) expression in HNSCC cells (Fig. 3Ba,b,c). In control samples, neither Stat-3 nor Nanog is downregulated in HSC-3 cells treated
with transfection reagents containing scrambled siRNA (Fig. 3B-a,b,c). Therefore, we
conclude that the downregulation of Stat-3 or Nanog expression by either Stat-3 siRNA or
Nanog siRNA used in our study is specific.

(2) Production of miR-21 in HNSCC cells—The expression of mature-miR-21 has
been shown to be involved in HNSCC progression (Chang, et al., 2008; Volinia, et al.,
2006). To determine whether miR-21 levels are increased following the binding of HA to
CD44, we first prepared small RNAs followed by an RNase protection assay using the
miRNA Detection Kit (Ambion). Our results indicate that the level of miR-21 is increased in
HSC-3 cells treated with scrambled sequence siRNA plus HA (Fig. 4a-lane 2) compared
with those cells without HA treatment (Fig. 4a-lane 1). HSC-3 cells treated with Nanog
siRNA (Fig. 4a-lane 4) or Stat-3 siRNA (Fig. 4a-lane 5) show significantly less HA-induced
miR-21 expression. These findings support the notion that both Nanog and Sta-3 are
required for miR-21 production in HA-activated HNSCC cells. We also noted that the
increase of miR-21 expression was specifically a result of the interaction between HA and
CD44 since pretreatment of HSC-3 cells with anti-CD44 antibody plus HA addition
significantly reduces miR-21 production (Fig. 4a-lane 3). Moreover, we have found that the
expression of miR-21 can be induced in cells treated with a miRNA-negative control upon
addition of HA (Fig. 4a-lane 7 vs. lane 6). In contrast, the treatment of HSC-3 cells with an
anti-miR-21 inhibitor plus HA results in a decrease in miR-21 expression (Fig. 4a-lane 8).
We believe that these changes in miR-21 expression under various treatment conditions was
not due to the variations of RNA extracted from each sample since there were very similar
levels of the miR-191 control in all samples (Fig. 4b-lane 1–8). Together, these findings

strongly suggest that HA/CD44-activated Nanog and Stat-3 signaling plays an important
role in the production of miR-21 in HNSCC cells.
The impact of HA/CD44-mediated miR-21 (induced by Nanog and Stat-3 signaling) in
PDCD4/IAP expression, anti-apoptosis and chemoresistance in HSC-3 cells

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

PDCD4 was identified as one of the tumor suppressor genes induced by miR-21 (Asangani,
et al., 2008). Inhibitors of the apoptosis family of proteins (IAPs) [e.g., cIAP-1, cIAP-2 and
X-linked IAPs (XIAP)] are frequently overexpressed by cancer cells. Importantly,
upregulation of IAPs (c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2 and XIAP) is linked to chemoresistance by their
binding to caspases and suppressing apoptosis (Hunter, 2007). Here, we demonstrate that
basal levels of PDCD4 expression and IAPs were detected in cells treated with scrambled
sequence siRNA without HA addition (Fig. 5a, lane 1; Fig. 5b-d, lane 1) or pretreated with
anti-CD44 antibody followed by HA addition (Fig. 5a, lane 3; Fig. 5b-d, lane 3). In contrast,
PDCD4 expression was significantly reduced and IAPs are greatly enhanced in cells treated
with scrambled sequence siRNA in the presence of HA (Fig. 5a, lane 2; Fig. 5b-d, lane 2).
Further analyses indicate that HSC-3 cells treated with Nanog siRNA or Stat-3 siRNA (in
the presence of HA) displays an elevated level of PDCD4 expression (Fig. 5a, lane 4 and
lane 5) and a decreased amount of XIAP expression (Fig. 5b-d, lane 4 and lane 5). These
observations confirm that HA/CD44-mediated Nanog and Stat-3 signaling is closely linked
to the expression of PDCD4 and/or IAPs in HSC-3 cells. We also noted that downregulation
of miR-21 by treating HSC-3 cells with an anti-miR-21 inhibitor (but not a negative-control
miRNA) promotes upregulation of PDCD4 expression (Fig. 5a, lane 8 vs. lane 6 and lane 7)
and downregulation of IAPs (Fig. 5b-d, lane 8 vs. lane 6 and lane 7) in the presence of HA.
These results indicate that the signaling network consisting of Nanog, Stat-3 and miR-21 is
functionally coupled with the inhibition of the tumor suppressor protein (PDCD4)
expression and the stimulation of survival protein (e.g., XIAP) production. These specific
effects may facilitate the progression of HA/CD44-activated HNSCC cells.

Author Manuscript

Further analyses indicate that the addition of HA enhances cell growth/survival and reduces
apoptosis in untreated control cells or anti-CD44 antibody treated cells (i.e., without
chemotherapeutic drugs) and decreases the ability of cisplatin to induce tumor apoptosis and
cell death (Table 1A). These observations strongly suggest that HA causes both a decrease
in apoptosis and an increase in tumor cell growth and survival (Table 1A) leading to the
enhancement of chemoresistance (Table 1A). Moreover, downregulation of Nanog, Stat-3 or
miR-21 [by treating HSC-3 cells with Nanog siRNA or Stat-3 siRNA or transfected HSC-3
cells with an anti-miR-21 inhibitor (but not scrambled sequence siRNA or with miRNAnegative control)] effectively attenuates HA-mediated tumor cell growth/anti-apoptosis/
survival and enhances multi-drug sensitivity in HSC-3 cells (Table 1A). These findings
suggest that the HA/CD44-mediated Nanog/Stat-3 signaling pathways and miR-21 function
may represent new targets to cause tumor cells to undergo apoptosis/death and overcome
chemotherapy resistance in head and neck cancer cells.
Apparently, both PDCD4 loss and IAP protein gain are responsible for HA-mediated
cisplatin resistance in HNSCC cells (Fig. 5). Recently, a small molecule IAP protein
inhibitor (bivalent SM-164) has been shown concurrently target cIAP-1/cIAP-2 for

degradation and antagonize XIAP leading to an enhancement of tumor cell apoptosis and
tumor regression (Lu, et al. 2008). In this study, we have found that chemosensitivity
increases with a newly developed IAP protein inhibitor, SM164 (Table 1B). These findings
suggest that the use of a combination of IAP protein inhibitor (SM164) and cisplatin may
improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drug treatments for head and neck cancer.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

The primary tumor type in head and neck cancer is squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
These tumor cells display persistent cell growth leading to chemoresistance and recurrence
(Parkin, et al., 2005). Hyaluronan (HA), the major glycosaminoglycan found in the
extracellular matrix of mammalian tissues, is now considered to be a physiologicallyrelevant ligand for CD44 (also known as a hyaluronan receptor) in many cell types including
HNSCC cells (Wang and Bourguignon, 2011). Most of malignant solid tumors display high
levels of both HA and CD44 (Toole and Hascall, 2002; Toole, et al., 2002; Wang and
Bourguignon, 2009). HA-CD44 interaction has been shown to promote oncogenic signaling
and tumor cell-specific properties (Turley, et al., 2002; Bourguignon, 2008). In this study we
focused on determining which oncogenic pathways are directly involved in regulating HA
and CD44-specific HNSCC cell behaviors such as chemotherapy resistance.

Author Manuscript

Nanog has been suggested as one of the major factors that render the reprogramming adult
stems into germ-line-competent induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (Kashyap, et al., 2009).
It is expressed not only in germ cell tumors, but also found to be expressed in many other
tumors including HNSCC cells and tissues (Chiou, et al., 2008). In this study we also
detected Nanog expression in HNSCC cells (e.g., HSC-3 cells) (Figs. 1 and 2). The fact that
Nanog overexpression is closely associated with HNSCC cells and tissues suggests that its
expression may be implicated in self-renewal and tumorigenesis via activating its
downstream target genes. The question of how Nanog signaling pathway plays a role in
regulating HNSCC cell activation has not been well-understood.

Author Manuscript

Overexpression miR-21 is detected in various HNSCC cell lines and patient specimens
(Volinia, et al., 2006; Chang, et al., 2008). Accumulating evidence indicates that miR-21 is
closely associated with both cancer development and chemotherapy resistance
(Bourguignon, et al., 2009a). Nanog appears to be involved in the regulation of pri-miRNA
expression during cancer development (Bourguignon, et al., 2009a). Our previous work
showed that HA/CD44-activated PKCε promotes Nanog interaction with p68 and DROSHA
leading to biosynthetic processing and production of miR-21 in breast tumor cells
(Bourguignon, et al., 2009). These findings suggest that HA/CD44-mediated Nanog
signaling is closely linked to miR-21 production and function during oncogenesis.
Abnormal Stat-3 signaling appears to play a critical role in oncogenesis (Huang, 2007). In
particular, constitutive activation of Stat-3 such as tyrosine phosphorylated Stat-3 has been
observed in human malignancies including HNSCC (Huang, 2007). Previous studies showed
that the functional link between Nanog and Stat-3 exists in several different tumor cells
(Bourguignon, et al., 2008). In this study we observed that HA-CD44 binding activates
Nanog/Stat-3 (also tyrosine phosphorylated Stat-3) nuclear localization and complex

formation in HSC-3 cells (Figs. 1–3). Thus, identifying specific genes that are
transcriptionally controlled by the Nanog-Stat-3 interaction in the nucleus may be very
important for the understanding of the disease mechanism occurring during HNSCC
progression. Activation of Stat-3 has also been shown to up-regulate the mRNA levels of
many genes, including miR-21 (Löffler D, 2007).

Author Manuscript

Here, we have provided new evidence that HA/CD44 activates Nanog-Stat-3 (also p-Stat-3)
complex formation and nuclear translocation in HNSCC cells (Figs. 1 and 2). Our results
also indicate that miR-21 is controlled by an upstream promoter/enhancer containing Stat-3
binding sites in HNSCC cells, while chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays
demonstrate that stimulation of miR-21 production by HA is Nanog/Stat-3 complexdependent in HNSCC cells (Fig. 3). Most importantly, an anti-miR-21 inhibitor can enhance
PDCD4 expression (Fig. 5), and block HA/CD44-mediated tumor functions [e.g., survival
protein expression (Fig. 5), tumor cell growth and survival/chemotherapy resistance (Table
1)] in HNSCC cells. Thus, this newly-discovered HA/CD44-Nanog/Stat-3 signaling
pathway and miR-21 production/function are highly innovative and should provide
important new drug targets to cause tumor cell apoptosis and overcome chemotherapy
resistance in head and neck cancer cells.

Cisplatin is the most common anti-head and neck chemotherapy used today. The ability of
this drug to induce tumor cell death is often counteracted by the presence of anti-apoptotic
regulators leading to chemoresistance (Nakamura, et al., 2005; Torre, et al., 2010; Wang and
Bourguignon, 2011). Several lines of evidence point toward the IAP family (e.g., c-IAP-1, cIAP-2 and XIAP) playing a role in oncogenesis via their effective suppression of apoptosis
(Hunter, 2007). The mode of action of IAPs in suppressing apoptosis appears to be through
direct inhibition of caspases and pro-caspases (primarily caspase 3 and 7) (Hunter, 2007).
IAPs also support chemoresistance by preventing tumor cell death induced by anticancer
agents (Gyrd-Hansen and Meier, 2010). Although certain anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g., BclxL) have been shown to participate in anti-apoptosis and chemoresistance in HA/CD44activated breast tumor cells (Bourguignon, et al., 2009b), the involvement of IAPs in HA/
CD44-mediated HNSCC cell survival and chemoresistance has not been fully elucidated.

Author Manuscript

In this study we demonstrated that HA/CD44-activated Nanog/Stat-3 signaling and miR-21
reduce PDCD4 expression (Fig. 5) resulting in oncogenesis [by enhancing the expression of
inhibitors of anti-apoptosis proteins (IAPs) (Fig. 5)]. Furthermore, downregulation of HA/
CD44-activated Nanog/Stat-3 signaling (by Nanog siRNA/Stat-3 siRNA) and miR-21
production (by anti-miR-21 inhibitor) not only induces PDCD4 upregulation (Fig. 5), but
also inhibits the expression of survival proteins (e.g., c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2 and XIAP) (Fig. 5).
Subsequently, these signaling perturbation events contribute to apoptosis and
chemosensitivity (Table 1). Our preliminary data indicate that (i) PDCD4 downregulation
can be detected as early as 30–60 min after HA binding to CD44, whereas IAP protein
upregulation can be detected 5–6 hours after HA-CD44 interaction; and (ii) PDCD4
overexpression blocks IAP protein expression. After 24h HA addition, a maximal level of
PDCD4 loss and IAP overexpression can be reached in HNSCC cells. Therefore, this time
point was used in Fig. 5. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the
regulation of these causal links between Nanog/Stat-3 signaling and miR-21 function

including PDCD4 dowregulation, IAP upregulation, anti-apoptosis and chemoresistance will
need to be resolved by further experiments.

Author Manuscript

As summarized in Fig. 6, we propose that HA binding (Step 1) promotes CD44 association
with Nanog and Stat-3 (also tyrosine phosphorylated Strat-3, p-Stat-3) (step 2). Nanog and
Stat-3 (also p-Stat-3) then translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus and interacts with an
upstream/enhancer region (containing Stat-3 binding sites) of the miR-21 promoter (step 4),
resulting in miR-21 gene expression and mature miR-21 production (step 5). The resultant
miR-21 then functions to downregulate the tumor suppressor protein (PDCD4) (step 6a) and
promotes HNSCC cell activation (step 7a) leading to IAP (c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2 and XIAP)
expression, HNSCC cell anti-apoptosis/survival and chemoresistance. In direct contrast,
treatment of HNSCC cells with an anti-miR-21 inhibitor induces tumor suppressor protein
(PDCD4) upregulation (step 6b). Subsequently, these changes result in the inhibition of IAP
(c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2 and XIAP) expression (Fig. 7b), stimulation of apoptosis and
enhancement of chemosensitivity in HNSCC cells. Taken together, these findings suggest
that targeting HA/CD44-mediated Nanog-Stat-3 signaling pathways and miR-21 function
may provide a new drug target to sensitize tumor cell apoptosis/death and overcome
chemotherapy resistance in HNSCC cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture

Author Manuscript

The cell line, HSC-3 cells (Japan Cancer Research Resources Bank, Tokyo), was established
in 1985 from a primary oral squamous cell carcinoma removed from the tongue of a 64year-old male patient. The HSC-3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco Modified Eagle
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were routinely serum starved
(and therefore deprived of serum HA) before adding HA.
Antibodies and Reagents

Author Manuscript

Monoclonal rat anti-CD44 antibody (Clone: 020; Isotype: IgG2b; obtained from CMBTECH, Inc., San Francisco, CA.) recognizes a determinant of the HA-binding region
common to CD44 and its principal variant isoforms. This rat anti-CD44 was routinely used
for HA-related blocking experiments and immunoprecipitation. Immuno-reagents such as
rabbit anti-Stat-3 antibody, goat anti-Nanog antibody, mouse anti-PDCD4 antibody, and
goat anti-actin antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz,
CA). Mouse anti-c-IAP-1 antibody, mouse anti-c-IAP-2 and mouse anti-XIAP antibody
were from BD (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Rabbit anti-phospho-Stat-3 (pY[705], tyrosine 705
residue) was from Cellular Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Cisplatin, was obtained
from Sigma Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Healon HA polymers (~500,000dalton polymers),
purchased from Pharmacia & Upjohn Company (Kalamazoo, MI) was prepared by gel
filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl S1000 column (GE Healthcare Biosciences).
Anti-miR-21 Inhibitor Preparation and Transfection
Anti-miR™ targeting miR-21 (anti-miR-21 inhibitor) (Ambion, catalog number, 17000) and
its corresponding negative control (Ambion, catalog number, 17010) were transfected into

HSC-3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) for 24h. Cells were then treated
with HA or without HA in various experiments as described below. The final concentrations
of anti-miR-21 inhibitor and miRNA-negative control used in various experiments were
30nmol/L.
Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting Techniques

Author Manuscript

Immunoprecipitation was conducted after homogenization of the cell lysate using rat antiCD44 antibody followed by goat anti-rat IgG-beads. Subsequently, the immunoprecipitated
materials were immunoblotted with rabbit anti-Nanog antibody (2μg/ml) or rabbit antiStat-3 antibody (2μg/ml) or rabbit anti-phospho-Stat-3 (pY[705]) (2μg/ml). The nuclear
fraction [using the extraction kit from Active Motif (Carsbad, CA)] of HSC-3 cells
(untreated or pretreated with anti-CD44 antibody) plus 50μg/ml HA (or no HA) for various
time intervals (e.g. 0, 5min, 15min or 60min) at 37°C] was also used for goat anti-Nanog
antibody-conjugated immunoprecipitation followed by rabbit anti-Stat-3-mediated
immunoblot, respectively.
In some cases, cell lysate of HSC-3 cells [pretreated with anti-CD44 antibody or transfected
with Nanog siRNA or Stat-3 siRNA or siRNA with scrambled sequences; or anti-miR-21
inhibitor or miRNA-negative control or without any treatment) followed by HA (50μg/ml)
addition (or no HA addition) for various time intervals (e.g. 0, 5min, 10min, 15min, 30min,
60min or 24h) at 37°C] were also immunoblotted using various immuno-reagents [e.g.,
mouse anti-PDCD4 (2μg/ml) or mouse anti-c-IAP-1 or mouse anti-c-IAP-2 antibody and
anti-XIAP (2μg/ml) or goat anti-actin (2μg/ml) (as a loading control), respectively].
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To examine whether Nanog-Stat-3 complex directly interacts with the upstream promoter/
enhancer region of miR-21, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays was performed in
HNSCC cells [pretreated with anti-CD44 antibody or transfected with Nanog siRNA or
Stat-3 siRNA or siRNA with scrambled sequences] treated with HA (50μg/ml) or without
HA using a kit (EZ ChIP) from Millipore Corp according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cross-linked chromatin lysates were sonicated and diluted with ChIP sonication buffer plus
protease inhibitors, divided and incubated with normal rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-Nanog
antibody or rabbit anti-Stat-3 antibody or rabbit anti-phospho-Stat-3 (pY[705]) antibody at
4°C overnight, then precipitated with protein G-agarose. Cross-linking was reversed by
overnight 65°C incubation; DNA fragments were then extracted with PCR purification kit,
analyzed by PCR and quantitated by real-time PCR using primer pairs specific for the
miR-21 upstream promoter/enhancer region containing the Stat-3 binding sites: forward
primer: 5′-CTGGGAGAAACCAAGAGCTG-3′ and reverse
primer:AGGGGACAAGTCAGAGAGAGG-3′ on an agarose gel as described previously
(Löffler, et al., 2007).
RNase Protection Assay Analysis of Mature miRNAs
Expression of miRNAs was qualitatively analyzed by RNase protection assay. For RNase
protection assay, enriched small RNA isolated from HSC-3 cells [transfected with
scrambled sequence siRNA with (or without) anti-CD44 antibody or transfected with Nanog

siRNA or Stat-3 siRNA or siRNA or anti-miR-21 inhibitor or miRNA-negative control in
the presence or absence of HA for various time intervals (e.g., 0, 5min, 10min, 15min,
30min or 2h) at 37°C] was enriched and purified using the mirVana miRNA Isolation kit
(Ambion). RNA concentrations were verified by measuring absorbance (A260) on the
NanoDrop Spectrophotometer ND-1000 (NanoDrop). The mirVana miRNA probe
construction kit (Ambion) was used to synthesize the 32P-labeled miR-21 antisense probe
and miR-191 probe loading control as described previously (Bourguignon, et al., 2009a).
Immunofluorescence Staining

Author Manuscript

HSC-3 cells (untreated or pretreated with anti-CD44 antibody) were incubated with HA
(50μg/ml) at 37°C for various time intervals (e.g., 0, 10, 30 or 60min) or with no HA. These
cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. Subsequently, these cells were rendered
permeable by ethanol treatment followed by incubating with Texas Red-conjugated antiNanog antibody and fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-Stat-3 antibody followed by DAPI
staining (a marker for nucleus). To detect non-specific antibody binding, DAPI-labeled cells
were incubated with FITC or Texas Red-conjugated normal IgG, respectively. No labeling
was observed in control samples. These fluorescence-labeled samples were then examined
with a confocal laser scanning microscope.
Clinical Tumor Samples

Author Manuscript

IRB approval was obtained from our institution’s Committee on Human Research. The
clinical tissue specimens were portions of primary tumors of patients undergoing surgical
treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) from multiple primary sites
of the upper aerodigestive tract at a UCSF university-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical
Center from September 1, 2001 to June 30, 2006. The presence of ≥80% cancer cells in the
procured samples was confirmed by a clinical pathologist as described previously (Wang et
al., 2009).
Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

The tissue specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 24
hours at 4°C and embedded in paraffin. Five μm-thick tissue sections were placed on
positively charged glass slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
Immunohistochemical stains were performed using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Rabbit antiNanog antibody or rabbit anti-Stat-3 antibody (dilution factor from 1:100 up to 1:1000
determined by titration) were applied to tissue sections and incubated overnight at 4°C.
Secondary biotinylated antibody and streptavidin-HRP conjugate complex were applied for
60 and 30 minutes, respectively. After washing in buffer, the chromogen diaminobenzidine
was applied for 5 minutes followed by a counterstain with Mayer’s hematoxylin. Negative
controls included substituting the primary antisera with preimmune sera from the same
species and omitting the primary antibody, or by using an antibody of irrelevant specificity.
In some cases, these clinical samples were also incubated with Texas Red-conjugated antiNanog antibody and fluorescein (FITC)-conjugated anti-Stat-3 antibody or rabbit antiphospho-Stat-3 (pY[705] antibody, respectively. To detect non-specific antibody binding,

HNSCC tumor sections were also incubated with FITC or Texas Red-conjugated normal
IgG, respectively. No labeling was observed in control samples. These fluorescence-labeled
samples were then examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope.
Tumor Cell Growth and Apoptosis Assays

Author Manuscript

HSC-3 cells were transfected with either scrambled sequence siRNA or with Nanog siRNA
(or Stat-3 siRNA) or anti-miR-21 inhibitor or miRNA-negative control or pretreated with
anti-CD44 antibody, as above. Some cells were also treated with an IAP inhibitor, SM164
(2nM) or vehicle control. These cells (5 × 103 cells/well) were then incubated with various
concentrations of cisplatin (4 × 10−9M - 1.75× 10−5M) with no HA or with HA (50ug/ml).
After 24h incubation at 37°C, MTT-based growth assays were analyzed as described
previously (Bourguignon, 2008, 2009a, 2009b). The percentage of absorbance relative to
untreated controls (i.e., cells treated with neither HA nor chemotherapeutic drugs) was
plotted as a linear function of drug concentration. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)
was identified as a concentration of drug required to achieve a 50% growth inhibition
relative to untreated controls. For apoptosis assay, FITC-conjugated Annexin V (for
measuring apoptotic cells) using Apoptosis Detection Kit (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was
used according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Bourguignon, et al., 2009b).

promoter/enhancer region in HSC-3 cells: ChIP assay was performed in HSC-3 cells
following protocols described in the Materials and Methods using the Stat-3 binding sitecontaining miR-21 promoter (upstream promoter/enhancer region)-specific primers by PCR.
Identical volumes from the final precipitated materials were used for the PCR reactions
[untreated cells (lane 1); cells treated with HA for 30min (lane 2); cells pretreated with antiCD44 antibody for 1h plus 30min HA addition (lane 3); cells pretreated with scrambled
siRNA with no HA (lane 4); cells pretreated with scrambled siRNA plus 30min HA addition
(lane 5); cells pretreated with Nanog siRNA plus 30min HA addition (lane 6); cells
pretreated with Stat-3 siRNA plus 30min HA addition) (lane 7). (a: anti-Stat-3-mediated
immunoprecipitated material; b: anti-phospho-Stat-3 (pY705)-mediated immunoprecipitated
material; c: anti-Nanog-mediated immunoprecipitated material; d: IgG isotype controlmediated precipitated material; e: total input materials). B: Verification of the specificity of
Nanog siRNA or Stat-3 siRNA used in the study.
Cell lysates isolated from HSC-3 cells [transfected with Nanog siRNA or Stat-3 siRNAtarget or scrambled siRNA] were solubilized by 1% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) buffer followed
by immunoblotting with anti-Stat-3 antibody (a), anti-Nanog antibody (b) or anti-actin (a
loading control) (c).

Detection of HA/CD44-induced PDCD4 and IAP (cIAP-1, cIAP-2 and XIAP) expression in
HSC-3 cells was performed by solubilizing cells with 1% Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) buffer
followed by immunobloting with anti-PDCD4 antibody or anti-cIAP-1 antibody or anticIAP-2 antibody or anti-XIAP antibody, respectively as described in the Materials and
Methods.
First, cell lysates were prepared from HSC-3 cells treated with scrambled sequence siRNA
[without HA (lane 1) or with HA for 24h (lane 2)] or treated with anti-CD44 antibody for 1h
followed by 24h HA addition (lane 3) or treated with Nanog siRNA plus HA for 24h (lane
4) or treated with Stat-3 siRNA plus HA for 24h (lane 5) or treated with miRNA-negative
control [without HA (lane 6) or with HA for 24h (lane 7)] or treated with anti-miR-21
inhibitor plus HA for 24h (lane 8). These samples were then immunoblotted with antiPDCD4 antibody (a) or anti-cIAP-1 antibody (b) or anti-cIAP-2 antibody (c) or anti-XIAP
antibody (d), respectively. The amount of actin detected by anti-actin-mediated immunoblot
(e) in each gel lane was used as a loading control.

Fig. 6. A proposed model for HA/CD44-mediated Nanog and Stat-3 signaling in the regulation of
miRNA-21 production, oncogenesis and chemoresistence in HNSCC cells

Author Manuscript

The binding of HA to CD44 (step 1) promotes a complex formation between Nanog/Stat-3
(also tyrosine phosphorylated Stat-3, p-Stat-3) and CD44 (step 2). Both Nanog and Stat-3
(p-Stat-3) then translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus and interacts with the Stat-3binding sites located at the upstream promoter/enhancer region of miR-21 (step 4), resulting
in miR-21 gene expression and mature miR-21 production (step 5). The resultant miR-21
then functions to downregulate the tumor suppressor protein (PDCD4) (step 6a, indicated by
the arrow with solid lines) and promote HNSCC activation leading to IAP (c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2
and XIAP) expression, HNSCC cell anti-apoptosis/survival and chemoresistance (step 7a,
indicated by the arrow with solid lines).
In direct contrast, treatment of HNSCC cells with an anti-miR-21 inhibitor induces tumor
suppressor protein (PDCD4) upregulation (step 6b, indicated by the arrow with dash lines).
Subsequently, these changes result in HNSCC cell inactivation including inhibition of IAP
(c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2 and XIAP) expression (Fig. 7b, indicated by the arrow with dash lines),
stimulation of apoptosis and enhancement of chemosensitivity in HNSCC cells. This newly-
