Abstract
The ability to visualize reporter gene expression in vivo has revolutionized all facets of biologic investigation and
none more so than imaging applications in oncology. Near-infrared reporter gene imaging may facilitate more
accurate evaluation of chemotherapeutic response in preclinical models of orthotopic and metastatic cancers. We
report the development of a cell permeable, quenched squarine probe (CytoCy5S), which is reduced by Escherichia
coli nitroreductase (NTR), resulting in a near-infrared ﬂuorescent product. Time-domain molecular imaging of
NTR/CytoCy5S reporter platform permitted noninvasive monitoring of disease progression in orthotopic
xenografts of disseminated leukemia, lung, and metastatic breast cancer. This methodology facilitated therapeutic evaluation of NTR gene–directed enzymatic prodrug therapy with conventional metronidazole antibiotics.
These studies show NTR/CytoCy5S as a near-infrared gene reporter system with broad preclinical and prospective
clinical applications within imaging, and gene therapy, of cancer. Cancer Res; 73(4); 1276–86. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Noninvasive imaging, permitting spatiotemporal monitoring of both disease progression and therapeutic efﬁcacy (1), has
had a major impact upon human drug development (2). In
particular, optical imaging of ﬂuorescent and bioluminescent
reporters has emerged as one of the most important preclinical
imaging modalities, with considerable developments in sensitive instrumentation, e.g., time-domain optical imaging (3),
contributing to its success. The relative simplicity of optical
hardware, ease of use, and high-throughput potential has
rendered optical imaging as an inexpensive modality accessible to both academic and industrial environments alike. While
reporter genes remain the cornerstone of the optical approach,
an ever-expanding palette of targeted and activatable probes,
exploiting the near infrared spectrum of light, enable a more
complete investigation of disease pathology in situ (4).
Anticancer drug screening in subcutaneous tumor models is
neither representative of human cancer nor predictive of
clinical success (5). A consequent paradigm shift toward drug

evaluation in more clinically relevant orthotopic and metastatic models has placed a greater emphasis upon imaging
cancer cells in dense parenchymatous organs, demanding
sensitive, deep tissue imaging. However, the major caveats of
visualizing ﬂuorescent proteins for this application has been
autoﬂuorescence and signiﬁcant attenuation of both their
excitation and emitted light in mammalian tissue by hemoglobin. While use of time-domain optical imaging can delineate
autoﬂuorescence from ﬂuorescent protein ﬂuorescence on the
basis of ﬂuorescence lifetime (3, 6), signiﬁcant efforts have
been placed on development of far-red–shifted ﬂuorescent
proteins that might exploit the far-red and near-infrared
window (approximately 630–900 nm) where hemoglobin
absorption is minimal (7–11). Bioluminescence imaging,
requiring no excitation source, has proven to be one of the
most sensitive platforms for small animal imaging (12). However, bioluminescence emission maxima are still less than 620
nm, which in addition to signiﬁcant scattering of bioluminescent photons, limit spatial resolution and detection at depth.
Nitroreductase (NTR), a ﬂavoprotein that reduces nitroaromatic prodrugs in the presence of NADPH or NADH to highly
toxic metabolites, has found clinical application as a prodrug
therapeutic strategy in cancer (13). Subsequently, a number of
quenched ﬂuorogenic probes have been designed as substrates
for NTR (14–18), and pilot studies probing their use in NTRmediated prodrug therapy have been carried out (18). These
recent developments suggest that NTR and suitable quenched
near-infrared substrate may be exploited as the basis for a
reporter gene based in vivo optical imaging platform.
Here, we present NTR reporter gene imaging as a method for
visualization of disseminated, orthotopic, and metastatic cancer in vivo, using CytoCy5S as a quenched, near-infrared
substrate. Synthetic methods of squarine-based NTR substrate
development, characterization, and mechanism of NTR

reduction are described for CytoCy5S. In our method, we
adopted time-domain imaging, which provides greater sensitivity and signiﬁcantly higher spatial resolution and detection
at depth as compared with epi-illumination imaging (19, 20).
Time-domain imaging of the NTR/CytoCy5S platform permitted longitudinal in vivo imaging of disseminated and orthotopic cancer models of lung, breast, and leukemia. Comparison
of time-domain gated NTR/CytoCy5S ﬂuorescence imaging to
ﬂuorescence protein imaging with enhanced GFP showed
greater sensitivity, detection at depth, and resolution of metastasis. Finally, we illustrate therapeutic efﬁcacy of gene-directed
enzyme prodrug therapy in vivo using the NTR/CytoCy5S
methodology to visualize therapeutic efﬁcacy.

Materials and Methods
For synthesis of CytoCy5S, nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR), high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), chromatographic analysis and puriﬁcation, NTR-CytoCy5S enzyme
assay, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS),
spectrophotometry, and Western Blot analysis, see Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell lines and cell culture
The promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cell line was a gift from Dr.
Lanotte (Hospital Saint Luis, Paris, France). IPC-81NTRþGFPþ
was kindly provided by Prof. Stein Ove Døskeland (University of
Bergen, Norway), whereas NCI-H460Lucþ and MDA-MB231Lucþ cells were kindly provided by Prof. James Lorens
(University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway). NB4 and NCI-H460
cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich,
Inc.). MDA-MB-231 and IPC-81 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium. The media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, or 10% horse serum (IPC81; PAA Laboratories GmbH), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PS;
Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% L-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich), and the
cells were incubated in a humidiﬁed atmosphere at 37 C in 5%
CO2. Authentication of all cell lines was done by DNA ﬁngerprinting using the AmpFlSTR Proﬁler Plus PCR Ampliﬁcation
kit (Applied Biosystems), conducted in April 2012.
GFPþNTRþ and GFPþNTR vector construction
The retroviral expression vector L149 pTra Puro2AGFP2ALuciferase2ANTR (Entrez: EU753858; GFPþNTRþ) was made
in several stages (details on request) by cloning the coding
sequences of puromycin-N-acetyl-transferase, EGFP, ﬁreﬂy
luciferase, and NTR into pTra (21) to allow Tet-regulated
expression. Each open-reading frame was separated from the
next by a linker encoding the 2A region (XXSGLRSGQLLNFDLLKLAGDVESNPGP) from foot-and-mouth disease virus.
This sequence is cleaved cotranslationally, resulting in the
production of approximately stoichiometric amounts of each
protein (22). Cleavage of the 2A linker leaves a short tag on the
C-terminus of the preceding protein and a single proline fused
to the N-terminus of the following protein. Although puromycin resistance, green ﬂuorescence, and NTR activity were
readily detected in the presence of the retroviral Tet Activator
CttaIH (23), no luciferase activity could be detected. This is

most probably due to the N-terminal proline or C-terminal 2A
tag interfering with folding/activity, as the presence of NTR
implies successful translation of luciferase.
A GFPþNTR control vector L134 pTra Puro2AGFP (GFPþ)
is identical to L149 except that GAATTCTAGAGCGGCCGC
replaces the sequence between the EcoRI site following EGFP
and the unique NotI site. This construct expresses puromycin
resistance and green ﬂuorescence.
Retroviral transfection of NB4 cells and selection of NB4
GFPþNTRþ cells by FACS
NB4, NCI-H460Lucþ, and MDA-MB-231Lucþ cells stably
expressing nitroreductase (NTR) and enhanced GFP (eGFP)
were engineered by retroviral transduction with the GFPþ
NTRþ (L149) and Tet Activator CttaIH vector. Production of
infectious retroviral vector particles in 293-based Phoenix A
packaging cells and infection of cells were carried out as
described (22). Likewise, NB4NTR- GFPþ (L134) cells (control)
were generated.
Flow cytometric analysis
Accuri (Accuri Cytometers Ltd.) or FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) ﬂow cytometers were used to quantify GFP ﬂuorescence [FL1 channel; 488 nm excitation laser, 530/30 band-pass
(BP) ﬁlter)] and NIR ﬂuorescence [NTR/CytoCy5S; 635 nm
excitation laser, 661/16 BP ﬁlter (Calibur), or 640 nm excitation
laser, 675/12.5 BP ﬁlter (Accuri)] from transduced cells. A total
of 1  106 cells were preincubated with CytoCy5S (1 mmol/L)
for 1 hour before analysis as indicated. In the study comparing
CytoCy5S ﬂuorescence after metronidazole (Mtz; 0.6 mmol/L)
treatment, 3.5  105 cells were incubated  metronidazole for
2 hours, and the last hour with CytoCy5S (1 mmol/L). When
analyzed on the cytometer, 10,000 events per sample were
acquired, and data analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar) software
version 8.8.6. Stably high expressing GFPþNTRþ and GFPþ
cells were isolated by a Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter
(FACSAria; BD Biosciences) using a 488 laser for GFP sorting
and 638 nm laser for sorting NTRþ cells preincubated for 1 hour
with 1 mmol/L CytoCy5S.
Fluorescence microscopy
Images of cell ﬂuorescence were acquired with a Zeiss Axio
Observer Z1 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging
GmbH) and analyzed by the AxioVision 4.8.2 software. For
NTR-CytoCy5S ﬂuorescence, 5  104 cells were preincubated
in 1 mmol/L CytoCy5S for 1 hour before washing with 1 PBS for
live cell imaging, or CytoCy5S was added just before imaging for
longitudinal ﬂuorescence microscopy as indicated. The cells
were kept at 37 C during imaging. NTR-CytoCy5S ﬂuorescence
was imaged with a BP 540–580 excitation ﬁlter and BP 630–
675 nm emission ﬁlter GFP with a BP 450–490 nm ﬁlter and BP
515–565 nm emission ﬁlter and 40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) with a 365 nm excitation ﬁlter and BP 420–470 emission
ﬁlter. Phase contrast images were also acquired.
Cell viability analysis
NTRþ and NTR cells were incubated for 24 hours with
metronidazole (0.3, 0.6, and 2.4 mmol/L) or CytoCy5S (0, 0.001,

0.01, 0.1, and 1 mmol/L) and cell viability evaluated by labeling
cells with the DNA intercalating dye Hoechst 33342. Nuclear
morphology was investigated as described (24). 300 to 400 cells
were counted in each well to determine the fraction of cells
with normal/abnormal nuclear morphology. NB4 cell viability
following 24 hours incubation with metronidazole (0.3, 0.6, and
2.4 mmol/L) was also determined using the Annexin-V, Paciﬁc
Blue (Life Technologies Ltd), and propidium iodide (PI; SigmaAldrich) assay. Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in
binding buffer (2.5% Annexin-V, Paciﬁc Blue). Samples were
incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature and added
binding buffer with PI (ﬁnal concentration 0.2 mg/mL). The
data were acquired on a BD LSR II Fortessa ﬂow cytometer (BD
Biosciences) and analyzed using Cytobank (www.cytobank.
org). The percentage of living cells is displayed relative to
untreated control cells. 3H-thymidine incorporation in cells
was used to examine effect of NTR and/or CytoCy5S on
proliferation. NTRþ and NTR cells (NB4, NCI-H460, and
MDA-MB-231) were seeded in 96-well plates and left to settle
for 20 hours before treatment. The cells were treated with
CytoCy5S (0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mmol/L) or metronidazole
(0, 0.3, 0.6, 2.4 mmol/L) for 24 hours, and 3H-thymidine (1 mCi
per well; TRA310, Amersham International) was added the last
18 hours of the treatment period before harvesting and analysis
of the cells using a Packard Microplate Scintillation and
Luminescence counter (PerkinElmer Life And Analytical
Sciences, Inc.).
General animal care
All experiments were approved by The Norwegian Animal
Research Authority and conducted according to The European
Convention for the Protection of Vertebrates Used for Scientiﬁc Purposes. NOD/LtSz-Prkdcscid (NOD/SCID), NOD/LtSzPrkdcscid/B2mnull (NOD/SCID/B2m), and NOD/LtSzPrkdcscid/IL-2Rg null (NSG) mice (Gades Institute, University
of Bergen. NOD-scid IL-2Rg null (originally a generous gift from
Prof. Leonard D. Shultz, Jackson Laboratories) were housed
in groups of 5 or less in individually ventilated cages (Techniplast) and kept on a 12-hour dark/light schedule at a constant temperature of 21 C and 50% relative humidity. The mice
had continuous access to food and autoclaved water. During
depilation and imaging, mice were anaesthetized with 1%
isoﬂuorane.
Leukemia, lung, and breast subcutaneous and
orthotopic xenograft models
NOD/SCID and NOD/SCID/B2m mice were irradiated from
a photon radiation source (BCC Dynaray CH4, 4 megavolt
photon irradiation source), with a sublethal dose of 2.5 Gy
before subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injections of leukemic
cells, respectively. A total of 10  106 or 5  106 NB4NTRþGFPþ
cells were suspended in 200 mL of sterile 1 PBS before
injection intraperitoneally or intravenously and in 100 mL
1 PBS with 10% Matrigel (Invitrogen) for subcutaneous
inoculation. NCI-H460NTRþLucþGFPþ cells were suspended in
20 mL 1 PBS with 25% Matrigel for intrapulmonary injection.
A total of 1  106 MDA-MB-231NTRþLucþGFPþ cells were suspended in 50 mL 1 PBS with 25% Matrigel for intramam-

mary injection. Mice treated with metronidazole were given
50 mg/kg intravenously twice daily when tumors reached 100
to 150 mm3. All cell suspensions were injected with a 28 G
syringe. Inoculated animals were monitored closely for signs of
advancing disease such as weight loss, rufﬂed fur and lethargy,
in general. Mice were sacriﬁced according to Institutional
guidelines.
Time-domain optical imaging
GFP and bioluminescence images were acquired as
previously described (3, 25). Time-domain imaging of NTR/
CytoCy5S ﬂuorescence was acquired 30 to 60 minutes following administration of 69 mg CytoCy5S in a 5% Cremaphore EL
solution in saline (100 mL) intravenously via the dorsal tail vein.
Bioluminescence images were acquired 10 minutes following
administration of 150 mg/kg D-luciferin (Promega) intraperitoneally. All imaging was conducted using Optix MX2 TimeDomain Molecular Imager (ART Inc.). All images were acquired
with raster scan points 1 mm apart and integration time of
0.3 to 1.5 seconds per raster point. Typical scanning times for a
whole body image with integration times of 0.3 second per
raster point were approximately 5 minutes. NTR/CytoCy5S
ﬂuorescence images were acquired using 670 or 635 nm pulsed
laser diodes as excitation sources with 700 or 650 LP ﬁlters,
respectively. Fluorescence lifetime gating was conducted with
Optix Optiview (software versions 1.04.01, 2.00.01, 2.01.00 and
2.02.00 ART Inc.), gating for peak NTR/CytoCy5S ﬂuorescence
lifetime of approximately 1.2 ns between 1.0 and 1.3 ns.
MR imaging of mice
MR images were acquired using a 7T horizontal bore magnet
(Pharmascan 70/16, Bruker BioSpin) operating at 300 MHz. A
38-mm diameter linear volume resonator was used for transmission and reception of radiofrequency (RF) radiation. After a
TriPilot scan, a T1-weighted FLASH pulse sequence (echo time
(TE)/repetition time (TR) ¼ 3.416 ms/247 ms, 25 ﬂip angle, 0.7
mm slice thickness, 8 consecutive slices, 3.0  3.0 cm2 ﬁeld-ofview, 117  117 mm2 in-plane resolution) was used to scan
axially through the lungs to localize the lung tumor. The
acquisition was respiratory triggered to minimize motion
artifacts. Breathing rate limited the maximum TR time and
therefore the number of slices collected in each image. Once
the tumor was localized, we identiﬁed the slice with the
largest tumor cross section. We then imaged this slice using
retrospective respiratory and cardiac triggering (Bruker Intragate ig-FLASH-cine pulse sequence, TE/TR ¼ 2.989 ms/8 ms,
10 ﬂip angle, 0.7 mm slice thickness, 1 slice, 6.0  6.0 cm2
ﬁeld-of-view, 234  234 mm2 in-plane resolution) to get a
motion-free image of the tumor. Finally, we imaged the tumor
again using our T1-weighted FLASH pulse sequence (same
parameters as for the axial T1-weighted FLASH), but this time
using sagittal and coronal slice orientation.
Histology
Organ or tumor samples collected following euthanasia
were transferred to a tube containing 4% formalin for parafﬁn-embedding, cryosectioning, and subsequent immunohistochemistry of the samples. Sections were stained with hema-

toxylin and eosin (H&E), and results were analyzed by standard
light microscopy (Olympus BX51, Olympus America Inc.).
Statistics
In cell viability and proliferation assays, triplicates were
analyzed for each sample and results given as mean  SEM.
Statistical signiﬁcance of differences in averages between
treatment groups in vitro and in vivo was determined using
a 2-tailed Student t test (GraphPad Prism 5.0, GraphPad
Software). For all statistical analysis, P < 0.05 was considered
signiﬁcant.

Results
Synthesis and characterization of NTR-activated
ﬂuorescent probe
Nitroreductase catalyses the reduction of nitro-aryl groups
to the corresponding hydroxylamine, providing the basis of a
gene-directed enzymatic prodrug therapy (13). We postulated
that introduction of an electron withdrawing dinitrophenyl
moiety into the far-red chromophore Cy5 would effectively
quench its ﬂuorescence, and upon intracellular enzymatic
reduction by NTR, yield a near-infrared ﬂuorescent product
providing the basis of an NTR-based reporter gene platform
(Supplementary Figs. S1A, S1B, S2A, and S2B). Thus, introduction of dinitro-aryl- and squarate functionality into the Cy5
chromophore yielded CytoCy5S (Supplementary Fig. S1A), a
proposed cell permeable substrate for NTR (26). LC/MS analysis of CytoCy5S showed a peak at 6.32 minutes using detection
at 630 nm, which upon initial incubation with NTR in the
presence of b-NADH and b-NADPH resulted in 2 additional
peaks with retention times of 3.08 and 1.42 minutes, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1C). MS analysis revealed the 3.08minute product resultant of 2 ions with m/z of 677 and 675,
consistent with the mono hydroxylamine and the mononitroso reduction products, respectively. Analysis of the peak
appearing at 1.42 minutes suggests reduction of both nitro
groups to the corresponding hydroxylamines, giving an m/z of
663 for the protonated species (Supplementary Fig. S1C). These
data are consistent with an overall reduction mechanism of
CytoCy5S to the dihydroxyl product via nitroso intermediates
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). After the 48-minute reaction time,
only minor amounts of both starting material and the monoreduction products could be detected (Supplementary Fig.
S1D). Spectrophotometric analysis of the ﬁnal reduction product revealed excitation and emission maxima of 631 and 688
nm, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1E), and NTR-dependent increase in ﬂuorescence in enzymatic assays (Supplementary Fig. S1F). Furthermore, kinetic analysis showed a
rapid ﬂuorescence induction upon addition of CytoCy5S substrate to NTR (Supplementary Fig. S1G).
In vitro evaluation of CytoCy5S in NTR-expressing cell
lines
Having shown CytoCy5S as a substrate for NTR resulting in a
highly ﬂuorescent near-infrared product, we retrovirally transduced a diverse array of cancer cells lines to explore its cell
permeability and application as a cellular gene reporter assay.
Accordingly, the cell lines NB4 (human acute promyelocytic

www.aacrjournals.org

leukemia), IPC-81 (rat acute myeloid leukemia), NCI-H460Lucþ
(human large cell lung carcinoma), and MDA-MB-231Lucþ
(human breast carcinoma) were retrovirally transduced with
the tTA-dependent L149 plasmid expressing both GFP and
NTR and tTA plasmids (Supplementary Fig. S2A, S2B, and S2D).
Western blots of transfected cell lines conﬁrmed NTR and GFP
expression, as exempliﬁed for NB4NTRþGFPþ cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Fluorescence microscopy of GFP (green) and
NTR/CytoC5S (red) ﬂuorescence illustrated bright ﬂuorescence in both channels (Supplementary Fig. S2D), whereas
overlay (yellow/orange) of GFP and CytoCy5S ﬂuorescence
correlated well. Stable transduction of these cell lines with the
tTA-dependent L149 and tTA plasmids did not alter cell growth
in comparison with controls (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Incubation of cell lines with 0.1 mmol/L CytoCy5S and ﬂuorescence
microscopy showed a rapid induction of bright ﬂuorescence in
NTR-expressing cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2E). Flow
cytometry analysis of NB4NTRþGFPþ and NB4WT cells following
incubation with 0.1 mmol/L CytoCy5S showed more than 100fold increase in ﬂuorescence in NB4NTRþGFPþ over NB4WT
(Supplementary Fig. S6) corresponding to enzymatic results
(Supplementary Fig. S1F). Crucially, incubation of cells with
CytoCy5S did not affect the proliferation or viability of NTRþ or
NTR cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C). To evaluate
the use of the NTR/CytoCy5S system for time-domain optical
imaging applications, pellets of deﬁned numbers of NTRþ cells
(0.01–1  106 cells) were immersed in a liposyn/Indian ink
phantom, as previously described (3) and imaged using a timedomain molecular imager with excitation source of 670 nm and
LP ﬁlter of 700 nm (Supplementary Fig. S2F). Excellent linear
correlation between cell number and ﬂuorescence intensity
were observed and imaging at depths of 6 to 8 mm was
achievable with 0.1–1  106 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2G and
S2H).
Time-domain imaging of NTR/CytoCy5S ﬂuorescence
We next examined the suitability of the NTR/CytoCy5S
ﬂuorescent reporter gene platform for near-infrared in vivo
optical imaging. NOD/SCID mice were implanted subcutaneously with NB4NTRþGFPþcells and imaging was conducted with
670 nm pulsed laser diode source and 700 nm long pass
collection ﬁlter following injection of 69 mg CytoCy5S intravenously (Supplementary Fig. S3A). As previously observed
in vitro, induction of ﬂuorescence was rapid with bright
tumoral ﬂuorescence noted 10 minutes after CytoCy5S injection. Stable ﬂuorescence was observed between 1 and 4 hours
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3C) and was still evident 8 hours
after injection. Similar observations were made imaging
NSG mice 8 days following orthotopic injection with NCIH460NTRþLucþGFPþ into the left lung parenchyma (Supplementary Fig. S3D). Induction of gastrointestinal ﬂuorescence was
also noted after CytoCy5S injection (Supplementary Fig. S3A,
bottom), as previously reported (18). Analysis of the CytoCy5S
ﬂuorescence lifetimes from both NTR-expressing subcutaneous tumors and gastrointestinal ﬂuorescence showed distinct
distributions up to 130 minutes (Supplementary Fig. S3B) after
which time they coalesce, suggesting ﬂuorescence lifetime
gating may be possible to discriminate between these 2 sources

of ﬂuorescence up to 2 hours following CytoCy5S administration.

this gating strategy was used in all ensuing work described
here.

Fluorescence lifetime gating of NTR/CytoCy5S
ﬂuorescence in vivo
The observation of gastrointestinal CytoCy5S-induced
ﬂuorescence would seriously impede the application of the
NTR/CytoCy5S reporter system in models with peritoneal
involvement. Thus, to rigorously examine whether ﬂuorescence lifetime gating could be used to differentiate between
CytoCy5S-induced gastrointestinal ﬂuorescence and tumoral
NTR ﬂuorescence, we imaged control mice with no cancer
cells, mice-bearing vector control (NB4GFPþ) or NTRþ
(NB4NTRþGFPþ) blood cancer cells (n ¼ 4 per group) in the
peritoneal cavity, one hour  following the administration of
CytoCy5S (Fig. 1A). Fluorescence was noted in all animals;
however, the distribution of ﬂuorescence lifetimes observed in
the animals differed in mice-bearing NTRþ cells (Fig. 1B) as
previously noted at this time point (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
While all control groups showed distributions with multiple
ﬂuorescence lifetimes at this time point, only one predominant
lifetime (peak of 1.2 ns) was evident in mice bearing NTRpositive tumors. Exploiting the differences in ﬂuorescence
lifetime distributions between control and NTR-positive
tumors (Fig. 1C), ﬂuorescence lifetime gating (1.0–1.3 ns) was
used to identify only those pixels exhibiting NTR/CytoCy5S
lifetime, and used to generate gated ﬂuorescence intensity
maps of scanned mice (Fig. 1D). Subsequently all mice
were imaged 30 to 60 minutes after CytoCy5S injection and

Longitudinal NTR/CytoCy5S imaging of disseminated
and metastatic disease progression in vivo
Having established ﬂuorescence lifetime gating as a robust
method to discriminate CytoCy5S induced gastrointestinal
ﬂuorescence from NTR-expressing cancer cells, we evaluated
the system in longitudinal monitoring of disseminated and
metastatic cancer progression, and validated results with
commonly used GFP or luciferase gene reporters. NSG mice
were injected intravenously with IPC-81NTRþGFPþ (n ¼ 4), IPC81WT (n ¼ 4) rat leukemia cells or NB4NTRþGFPþ human acute
promyelocytic cells (n ¼ 7) and disease course imaged with
NTR/CytoCy5S (30 minutes following CytoCy5S i.v. injection)
and GFP-gated ﬂuorescence. Femoral ﬂuorescence was evident
as early as 5 to 7 days following IPC-81NTRþGFPþ cell injection
(Fig. 2A) with increase in NTR/CytoCy5S-gated ﬂuorescence
(r2 ¼ 0.6316) noted as a function of time (Fig. 2D). Leukemia was
ﬁrst evident after 17 to 24 days using GFP-gated ﬂuorescence
imaging in the same mice (Fig. 2C). IPC-81WT showed minimal
NTR/CytoCy5S ﬂuorescence (Fig. 2B and D). Ex vivo imaging
and H&E staining of bone marrow samples from the femur and

CytoCy5S-gated images of NB4NTRþGFPþ mice revealed earlier
detection of leukemia, particularly in the spines and femurs,
than respective GFP-gated images at day 14 and more
extensive disease patterns at day 18 (Fig. 2F). In vivo tumors
were conﬁrmed by ex vivo imaging and histology (Fig. 2G).

ﬂuorescence quantiﬁcations determined from these images. E, histology (H&E staining) of femurs [scale bar, 200 mm for large image and 100 mm for the
femur magniﬁcation (right)]. F, similarly, earlier detection of NB4NTRþGFPþ leukemia (5  106 cells per mouse; n ¼ 7) in spinal and femoral bone marrow
was possible by imaging NTR/CytoCy5S ﬂuorescence (white circles). G, ex vivo images and H&E histology from spinal, ovarian, and lymph node
tumors from 2 NB4NTRþGFPþ mice (scale bar, 100 mm). All NTR/CytoCy5S ﬂuorescence images were acquired 30 minutes following CytoCy5S injection. All
ﬂuorescence images are presented on Log scale.

NCI-H460NTRþLucþGFPþ cells, expressing NTR, GFP, and
luciferase, were injected orthotopically into the left lung
parenchyma of NSG mice (n ¼ 5) and imaged on days 5, 8,
and 14 for NTR/CytoCy5S ﬂuorescence (Fig. 3A and F). Bioluminescence imaging and T1-weighted FLASH MRI conﬁrmed
tumor placement (example in Fig. 3B and C). At days 5 and 8,
NTR/CytoCy5S-gated ﬂuorescence images were comparable
with acquired bioluminescence images. Six days later, both
bioluminescence and NTR/CytoCy5S-gated ﬂuorescence
images revealed extensive pulmonary metastasis in dorsal and
ventral aspects. Necropsy of the mice and ex vivo imaging
veriﬁed extensive lung metastasis (Fig. 3D and E), which was
conﬁrmed histologically (Fig. 3G and H). Encouragingly,
NTR/CytoCy5S-gated dorsal images demonstrated deﬁnitive
detection of a pulmonary tumor on day 5, which was consistent with MRI imaging, bioluminescence, and primary tumor
location at later time points. These results suggest a role for
NTR/CytoCy5S in multimodal imaging applications.
Finally, we investigated NTR/CytoCy5S-gated imaging of the
MDA-MB-231NTRþLucþGFP metastatic mammary carcinoma

www.aacrjournals.org

model (Fig. 4). A total of 1  106 cells were injected orthotopically into the mammary fat pad of NSG mice (n ¼ 4) and
NTR/CytoCy5S-gated ﬂuorescence images acquired on a weekly basis. Previously, axial lymph node metastasis has been
formerly shown by in vivo optical imaging of the MDA-MB231 orthotopic breast cancer model (27, 28). NTR/CytoCy5Sgated ﬂuorescence images revealed progressive primary tumor
ﬂuorescence up to week 7 (Fig. 4C) with initial axial lymph node
metastasis at week 8 (see arrow Fig. 4A). Detection of additional
metastasis in this region was observed by week 9 (see inset). At
week 12, multiple tumors along the draining lymphatic vessel
were noted and a further distal auxiliary lymphatic metastasis.
Interestingly, ﬂuorescence was also observed in the liver with a
faint area of ﬂuorescence in the upper thorax (Fig. 4B). Ex vivo
imaging following necropsy revealed ﬂuorescence associated
with primary tumor section, several lymph node tumors along
the draining lymphatic vessel, in addition to liver ﬂuorescence
and small foci in the lungs (Fig. 4D and E). Microscopic
examination of histology sections from these organs conﬁrmed
lymph and liver metastasis (Fig. 4F).

Gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy evaluation with
NTR/CytoCy5S
NTR is typically used as the activating enzyme in the genedirected enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) approach to cancer
chemotherapy. We therefore investigated the use of the NTR/
CytoCy5S platform for active imaging of GDEPT (Fig. 5). The
nitroimidazole, metronidazole (Fig. 5A), has previously been
described as an NTR substrate in GDEPT therapeutic
approaches (29) and conditional cell ablation in Zebraﬁsh
(30). Incubation of NB4 wt or NB4NTRþGFPþ cells with increasing concentrations of metronidazole (0.3–2.4 mmol/L) for 24
hours resulted in NTR-dependent cell death, evaluated by
microscopic examination following Hoechst 33342 (P <
0.01–0.05; Fig. 5B), ﬂow cytometry with AnnexinV/PI viability
assay (P < 0.001–0.05; Supplementary Fig. 5A and B), and 3Hthymidine incorporation proliferative assay (P < 0.01; Supplementary Fig. 5C). Similar results were observed with adherent
cell lines expressing NTR (Supplementary Fig. S5D and S5E). To
assess any potential metronidazole-competitive inhibition of
CytoCy5S reduction by NTR via decrease in ﬂuorescence
output, NB4NTRþGFPþ cells were incubated  metronidazole
(0.6 mmol/L) for 2 hours with CytoCy5S for the last hour and
ﬂuorescence evaluated by ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 5C). No differences were observed in median NTR/CytoCy5S ﬂuorescence
intensity  metronidazole. Subsequently, NSG mice bearing

subcutaneous NB4NTRþGFPþ tumors were randomized (P ¼
0.24) into control (vehicle, 134  15 mm3, n ¼ 7) or metronidazole-treated (50 mg/kg, b.i.d., 107  25, n ¼ 8) groups and
treated for 10 consecutive days (Fig. 5D). Caliper measurements of tumor volume showed signiﬁcant inhibition of tumor
growth between the NB4NTRþGFPþ groups (P < 0.01–0.05) from
2 days following initiation of treatment through to termination
of the study (Fig. 5E). Similarly, NTR/CytoCy5S-gated ﬂuorescence images correlated well with caliper measurements (Fig.
5H; Pearson r ¼ 0.88), with treated mice illustrating signiﬁcant
differences in ﬂuorescence intensities throughout treatment
(Fig. 5F; P < 0.001–0.05). NSG mice xenografted with the NTR
cell line, NB4GFPþ, subcutaneously were similarly divided (P ¼
0.29) into control (95.9  16 mm3, n ¼ 4) and metronidazole
(125  17 mm3, n ¼ 4) groups and treated analogously. No
signiﬁcant differences in tumor progression were noted (Fig.
5G). These results establish NTR/CytoCy5S-gated ﬂuorescence
imaging as a powerful gene reporter imaging technique permitting temporal monitoring of NTR-targeted GDEPT efﬁcacy.

sites are not known a priori, is often problematic with

application of exogenous ﬂuorochromes. Far-red or nearinfrared reporter gene labeling of cancer cells better suit such
whole body imaging applications (31). Accordingly, we expect
whole-body, time-domain imaging of NTR reporter gene
expression to broaden the possibilities of noninvasive optical
imaging and be a practical and useful addition to current
ﬂuorescence and bioluminescence methodologies.
The current study has not presented data comparing red
ﬂuorescence protein and NTR/CytoCy5S imaging and there are
several reasons for this. Despite innovative engineering of farred proteins with the speciﬁc aim of deep tissue whole body
imaging, their adaption to macroscopic imaging has generally
been limited thus far (32). A recent study concluded that
despite increases in detected ﬂuorescence gained from switching to red-shifted protein from GFPs, beneﬁts were compromised by increases in autoﬂuorescence in transillumination
geometry (33). While we anticipate that time-domain imaging
of infrared ﬂuorescent protein (iRFP; ref. 11) will ameliorate
ﬂuorescence detection, a report comparing time-domain
imaging of the far-red Katushka and GFP concluded that
longitudinal imaging was superior with GFP (34). We have
shown here the superiority of the NTR/CytoCy5S methodology
compared with GFP (Fig. 2) and the possibility for multimodal
imaging with NTR/CytoCy5S and ﬂuorescent proteins.
A caveat to the NTR reporter platform is the necessity of a
ﬂuorogenic substrate such as CytoCy5S. However, substrate
injection has not prevented the luciferases in becoming the

www.aacrjournals.org

most commonly used preclinical optical reporter gene (12, 35).
Furthermore, the rapid induction of ﬂuorescence and consistency of the NTR/CytoCy5S signal over several hours (Supplementary Fig. S3) makes this imaging platform very attractive
for raster scanning imaging techniques, which typically require
long timeframes of 5 to 20 minutes to acquire whole body
images of a single mouse. Undoubtedly, a signiﬁcant beneﬁt of
the NTR/CytoCy5S platform as shown here has been the
sensitivity of the imaging technique to detect disseminated
and metastatic cancer cells in organs of high blood volume.
Here, we have veriﬁed the sensitivity of the NTR/CytoCy5S
imaging platform to detect metastasis in the liver (Fig. 4) in
addition to leukemia in bone marrow (Fig. 2) conﬁrmed by ex
vivo imaging and histology. Indeed, an intriguing future perspective may include use of the NTR/CytoCy5S reporter platform to image the in vivo leukemogenesis of leukemic stem
cells, disease evolution following their ablation by GDEPT, in
addition to NTR/CytoCy5S-mediated differential population
sorting, and quantiﬁcation by ﬂow cytometry. Further evolution of the methodology using further near-infrared–shifted
ﬂuors such as Cy5.5 and Cy7 may yield multiple substrates for
multimodal optical imaging of NTR gene expression.
In summary, by combining the NTR enzyme and its
quenched ﬂuorogenic substrate CytoCy5S, with time-domain
optical imaging, we have generated a sensitive, near-infrared
approach permitting preclinical imaging of orthotopic and
metastatic tumors. Validation of the method in several

NTR Optical Imaging of Metastatic Cancer

preclinical models of disseminated, orthotopic, and metastatic
cancers showed sensitive primary tumor and metastasis visualization. Furthermore, we established that the NTR/CytoCy5S
reporter platform could be used to image GDEPT therapeutic
efﬁcacy concomitantly with prodrugs, without interference.
This is an important aspect to the current study. While NTR is
a promising clinical candidate for GDEPT cancer therapy
(36–38), a caveat to preclinical development of NTR-based
GDEPT strategies has been an inability to visualize NTRþ cells
under GDEPT. We believe use of this platform will accelerate
GDEPT interventions towards clinical development and may
provide the basis for a positron emission tomography–based
radiotracer suitable for clinical imaging of NTR-based GDEPT
approaches.
