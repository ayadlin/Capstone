the resection margin.

METHODS. In this study, the authors prospectively enrolled 25 patients with GBM
who underwent gross total resection followed by adjuvant radiochemotherapy
(with temozolomide). Tumor removal was achieved with resection margins that
included the neighboring, apparently normal tissue (between 1 cm and 2 cm
from the tumor border [B area]) and the tumor.

RESULTS. Patients who had an absence of tumor cells in the neighboring, apparently normal white matter (B area) had better survival than patients who had the

lioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary
malignant neoplasm of the central nervous system in adults.1,2
Despite multimodal therapies, the median survival of patients with
GBM is approximately 1 year; however, considerable variability
exists among these patients.1,2 Prognostic indicators include age,
Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) score, extent of surgical resection, and radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide.1-5
The prognostic role of the extent of resection in GBM is controversial given the lack of randomized controlled trials addressing this
issue. After surgical resection of a GBM, the residual pool of invasive
cells gives rise to a recurrent tumor, which, in 96% of patients, arises
adjacent to the resection margin or within 2 to 3 cm from the resection cavity.6 This pattern of local treatment failure most likely is
because of residual tumor cells peripheral to the removed, highly
cellular tumor.7

Patient Selection Criteria and Treatment
Patients who were enrolled in this study satisfied the
selection criteria shown in Table 2. Advanced age
was not an exclusion criterion. All patients provided
consent to use their tumor and peritumor material
as well as clinical data for research purposes.
Tumor removal was achieved with resection margins that included the neighboring, apparently normal tissue (between 1 cm and 2 cm from the tumor
border; larger resections were performed in tumors
that grew far from eloquent areas) and the tumor,
which were removed entirely en bloc (Figs. 1, 2).
Neuronavigation and intraoperative ultrasound were
used to maximize the extent of intracranial tumor
resection.
Thirty-five days after surgery (range, 30-40 days),
patients received an external source limited-field
radiotherapy (with an average dose of 60 grays administered in fractions). Simultaneously, chemotherapy
with temozolomide (Temodal) was administered at a
dose of 75 mg/m2 per day. After a 1-month break,
patients received up to 6 cycles of temozolomide at a
dose from 150 to 200 mg/m2 per day on the standard

schedule of 5 days per week every 28 days. All
patients underwent the same adjuvant therapy protocol. We did not use bevacizumab, carmustine,
radioimmunotherapy, or any other adjuvant therapy. Therefore, survival was not biased by adjuvant
treatment.
Reversible grade 2 and 3 lymphocytopenia and/
or thrombocytopenia were observed in 10 patients.
Those effects were not severe enough to lead to
treatment interruption.
All patients were followed as outpatients 1
month after surgery and every 3 months thereafter.
No patients were lost to follow-up.

Tissue Specimens
We obtained samples from different areas: enhanced
lesion (A area) and white matter close to the tumor,
between 0.5 cm and 2 cm from the tumor border (B
area) (Fig. 2). The samples were fixed immediately in
10% neutral-buffered formalin at room temperature
for at least 48 hours, washed in water, dehydrated,
and then embedded in paraffin.
According with Hoelzinger et al, white matterinvading neoplastic cells were identified by means of
their nuclear atypia and heteropyknotic staining.8
Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunolabeling
of B area samples was used routinely to identify reactive astrocytes, which were identified by their clear,
large nuclei; eosinophilic cytoplasm; and long, thick,
stellate, GFAP-positive processes. Specimens from B
area were assessed histologically by 2 independent
pathologists who identified the presence of neoplastic cells in each sample (Fig. 3). Two sections from
each area were examined by 2 different observers independently, and at least 1000 to 2500 cells from 4 to
10 randomly selected fields in each section were
counted. By using a light microscope (Axioskop 2

plus; Zeiss), the presence of tumor cells was evaluated at 3400 magnification. Samples with discrepant
scoring were re-evaluated jointly on a second occasion, and agreement was reached. The results were
categorized as ‘infiltrated’ if tumor cells were
detected in at least 1 specimen (Table 3).

Statistical Methods
For all analyses, we used the SPSS software package
for Windows (version 11.0.1; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill).
Patients were dichotomized into 2 groups according
to the presence of absence of tumor cells in the B
area. Patients’ survival rates were determined by

using the Kaplan-Meier method; survival curves were
compared by using the log-rank test and the Breslow
test. Cox proportional-hazards regression models
were fitted to evaluate the effect of tumor infiltration
on survival and were adjusted for known prognostic
factors, such as age (<65 years vs 65 years), preoperative KPS score (80 vs 90-100), and extent of
resection of T2 abnormality (1 cm vs 2 cm). Survival
was calculated from the date of surgery to the date
of death (or the date of last follow-up in the 1
patient who remained alive). Statistical significance
was set at P < .05.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The overall median survival was 18 months (range,
5-39 months). Patients with an absence of tumor
cells in the neighboring, apparently normal tissue (B
area) had better survival than patients with the presence of cells in the B area (median survival, 21
months vs 12 months) (Fig. 4). This difference was
statistically significant in univariate analysis (log-

rank test, 7.84 [P 5 .005]; Breslow test, 8.30 [P 5
.004]). Tumor cell infiltration into the surrounding
white matter proved to be an independent prognostic factor when the analysis was corrected for other
known predictors of survival, such as age, extent of
resection (T2), and KPS (P 5 .024) (Table 4). Recurrent tumor occurred adjacent to the resection margin
in 15 of 23 patients (65%); 8 of 23 patients (35%) had
recurrences far from the resection margin, and 2
patients had no recurrence (Table 3). The incidence
of tumor recurrence at the margin was 75% (6 of 8
patients) among patients with infiltrated margins
and 60% (9 of 15 patients) among patients without
infiltrated margins; 2 patients without infiltrated
margins had no recurrence. These data differ widely
from data reported in the literature, in which glioblastoma reportedly recurred at the margins in 96%
of patients.6
Tumor cell infiltration was not identifiable with a
sequence of magnetic resonance images. Conversely,
as demonstrated in our histologic examination, infil-

trating cells were not always detected in the T2 component, where signal alteration was similar in both
the group with and the group without infiltration.
Many attempts are in progress to address this issue.9
In our opinion, future efforts should be focus on
developing imaging techniques capable of evaluating
biologic alteration that, as demonstrated in the literature, can precede evidence of a neoplastic phenotype.8,10
The survival advantage of an extensive surgical
resection of GBM remains controversial. The published neurosurgical literature remains unclear
regarding whether the extent of surgical resection is
correlated statistically with survival.4,11-17 Almost all
of the modern studies are retrospective and, thus,
are subject to numerous sources of bias.
In the series reported by Lacroix et al, the extent of
resection in patients with GBM began to be associated
with a survival advantage at 89% of the tumor volume.4
Aggressive resection of 98% of the tumor volume was
a significant, independent predictor of survival.

FIGURE 4. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival. Patients who had the presence of tumor cells in the neighboring apparently normal tissue (tumor border area; n 5 8) had a median survival of 12 months (95% confidence
interval [CI], 7-17 months). For patients in whom tumor cells were absent
(n 5 17), the median survival was 21 months (95% CI, 11-31 months; logrank test, 7.84; P 5 .005; Breslow, 8,30; P 5 .004). Cum Survival indicate
cumulative survival.

Shinoda et al observed that gross total resection
was a significant, independent, good prognostic factor in patients with GBM.11 According to those
authors, radical resection should be recommended,
taking into consideration tumor location, size, and
eloquence of adjacent brain. In our population, the
median survival was 15 months (95% confidence
interval [CI], 12-18 months) for patients who had
resection margins 1 cm from the tumor border (12
patients) and 18 months (95% CI, 10-26 months) for
patients who had resection margins 2 cm from the
tumor border (13 patients). The difference between
the 2 groups was not significant in univariate analysis
(log-rank test, 1.24 [P 5.26]; Breslow test, 1.27 [P 5.26]).
The Cox proportional-hazards model also indicated
that there was no significant difference between
groups (Table 4). Even if these results are not statistically significant, it is not possible to definitively
exclude the possibility that surgical extent is not a
prognostic marker because of the small number of
patients in our population. With a greater number
of patients, this trend very well may have significance as a prognostic variable. The most vexing problem that precludes surgical cure of GBM is the
infiltrative behavior of these lesions. Even tumors

that appear to be circumscribed have isolated tumor
cells around the border, and these tumor cells may
extend as far as 4 cm to 5 cm from the epicenter of
the lesion. Silbergeld and Chicoine demonstrated
that malignant tumor cells could grow in tissue culture from surgical specimens obtained at a minimum of 4 cm from the macroscopic and radiologic
margin of the tumor.18
Current surgical therapies address the enhanced
lesion, whereas recurrence most often occurs within
2 cm to 3 cm of the resection margin and accounts
for the fatal outcome of the disease.6 Little is known
about the distinct biology of invasive glioblastoma
cells in situ, but their diffuse infiltration suggests the
activation of genetic and cellular processes that distinguish them from cells in the tumor core.19-21
Glioblastoma invasion is a very dynamic process
that has an impact on multiple features of the glioma
cells. Invasion and proliferation behaviors of GBM
cells will prove to be regionally and temporally variable. Despite very low proliferating indices of distantly invasive GBM cells or even an inability
morphologically to identify glioma cells that are distant from the rim of obvious tumor, nonetheless, it is
possible to harvest clonogenic glioma cells from
such noncontiguous sites.19,20 The clonogenic potential of these more invasive glioma cells is the ultimate cause of tumor recurrence.
Berens and Giese observed that tumor cells harvested from the vital core of a GBM rapidly grew to
large colonies in soft agar, whereas cells that were
plated from regions of invaded brain developed
smaller colonies.21 When they were tested for migration in vitro, cells derived from invaded brain had
higher motility rates compared with cells from solid
tumor, suggesting that invasive glioma cells are more
likely migratory than proliferative.21 Such an observation parallels the in vivo presentation of GBM, in

846

CANCER

which the invasive cells do not manifest any proliferative activity and are not detectable by available neuroimaging techniques until they generate a recurrent,
satellite lesion either adjacent to or far from the
resection margin.7,21 Thus, at some point in their
biology, migratory tumor cells, in fact, do become
proliferative.
In our selected population, we performed a tumor resection that was enlarged beyond the rim of
the enhanced lesion, and we tried to verify the
impact of this procedure on median survival. In this
series, the median survival for all patients from the
time of surgery was 18 months, and the different patterns of peripheral infiltration (absence or presence
of tumor cells) were associated significantly with survival (21 months vs 12 months, respectively). Tumor
cell infiltration into the surrounding white matter
proved to be an independent prognostic factor.
Our results may lead to the conclusion that
aggressive tumor removal may improve survival;
however, but biologic commitment of ‘penumbra’
cells appears to be the most relevant factor for tumor
recurrence and accounts for the fatal outcome of the
disease. In fact, it is known that the white matter adjacent to the tumor, even if it is normal morphologically, is a biologically active area.7,8,18,21 In a selected
population, expanding resection to this radiologic
silent tissue may improve survival because of the removal of the active biologic substrate from which tumor cells regrow. If we resect the enhanced lesion
alone, then we determine a cytoreduction of morphologically neoplastic cells, according to the most
recent stage of carcinogenesis. When resecting within
the T2 component, we interfere with an earlier, precancerous stage in an area in which, even if tumor
cells cannot be detected clearly, several molecular
alterations exist.8 Because we observed no correlation between the extent of resection (within the T2
component) and survival, we simply recommend
resecting the T2 component. Then, the presence or
absence of infiltrating cells could be used as a prognostic factor.
