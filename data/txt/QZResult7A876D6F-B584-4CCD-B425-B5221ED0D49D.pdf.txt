ABSTRACT
Previously we reported that valproic acid (VPA) acts in synergy with GOS to
enhance cell death in human DU145 cells. However, the underlying mechanism
remains elusive. In this study, we observed that such synergistic cytotoxicity of GOS
and VPA could be extended to human A375, HeLa, and PC-3 cancer cells. GOS and VPA
co-treatment induced robust apoptosis as evidenced by caspase-8/-9/-3 activation,
PARP cleavage, and nuclear fragmentation. GOS and VPA also markedly decreased
cyclin A2 protein expression. Owing to the reduction of cyclin A2, Akt signaling was
suppressed, leading to dephosphorylation of FOXO3a. Consequently, FOXO3a was
activated and the expression of its target genes, including pro-apoptotic FasL and
Bim, was upregulated. Supporting this, FOXO3a knockdown attenuated FasL and
Bim upregulation and apoptosis induction in GOS+VPA-treated cells. Furthermore,
blocking proteasome activity by MG132 prevented the downregulation of cyclin A2,
dephosphorylation of Akt and FOXO3a, and induction of apoptosis in cells co-treated
with GOS and VPA. In mouse model, GOS and VPA combination significantly inhibited
the growth of A375 melanoma xenografts. Our findings indicate that GOS and VPA
co-treatment induces apoptosis in human cancer cells by suppressing the cyclin-A2/
Akt/FOXO3a pathway.

promising strategy to counteract cancer resistance [3].
Among these epi-drugs, HDAC inhibitors have garnered
much interest particularly for their potential to enhance the
anticancer efficacy of chemotherapy or radiotherapy [4–7].
Gossypol (GOS), a natural product isolated from
cottonseeds, has been identified as a BH3-mimetic
small-molecular inhibitor of Bcl-2 family members [8,
9]. Many studies have highlighted the anti-proliferative
and pro-apoptotic activities of GOS in cancers, including
leukemia, colon carcinoma, and prostate carcinoma cells
[10–12]. However, a phase II clinical trial showed that
GOS was not active in patients with recurrent chemosensitive small cell lung cancer and failed to induce

INTRODUCTION
Induction of apoptosis is a common feature of
successful chemotherapy and radiotherapy for various types
of cancers. However, resistance to these therapies is often
induced in clinical treatment of cancer, partly due to defects
of pro-apoptotic signaling pathways and overexpression of
anti-apoptotic genes in cancer cells [1, 2]. Many strategies
have been explored to overcome such resistance of cancer.
The combination of conventional chemotherapeutic agents
with compounds targeting epigenetic mechanisms (i.e.,
epi-drugs), including inhibitors of histone deacetylases
(HDACs) and DNA methyltransferases, represents a

apoptosis in vivo [13]. Indeed, GOS is a relatively lowtoxic agent with limited cytotoxicity on cancer cells, thus
limiting its use alone as an effective anticancer agent [14].
Interestingly, several studies indicated that combination
therapy with GOS may induce synergistic cell death in
cancer cells [15–17].
We have previously shown that GOS acts in synergy
with valproic acid (VPA, a HDAC inhibitor) to induce cell
death in human DU145 prostate cancer cells [18], but the
precise molecular mechanism underlying such an effect is
still barely understood. For example, it is unclear whether
combined GOS and VPA treatment induces apoptosis in
cancer cells. It is also unknown whether the synergistic
effect of GOS and VPA is cancer-type specific and
whether other HDAC inhibitors have similar effects when
they are combined with GOS. To address these issues,
we analyzed the combined effects of GOS with VPA,
suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, also known as
Vorinostat) or tubacin, and explored the potential action
mechanism of GOS and VPA combination in human A375
melanoma, HeLa cervical, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells.
Our data indicate that VPA, but not SAHA or tubacin, acts
in synergy with GOS to induce apoptosis in these cancer
cells by suppressing the cyclin-A2/Akt/FOXO3a signaling
pathway.

GOS and VPA co-treatment resulted in more pronounced
irregular morphology and cell rounding compared with
each agent alone (Supplementary Figure S1). Thus, VPA
could synergistically augment the cytotoxicity of GOS
in A375, HeLa, and PC-3 cells without overt cell-type
preference.

Combined GOS and VPA treatment robustly
induces apoptosis
Next, we sought to explore whether this synergistic
cytotoxicity of GOS plus VPA resulted in apoptosis. To do
this, cells were cultured overnight and then treated with
GOS, VPA or their combination for 24 h. Nuclear staining
showed a significant increase in condensed or fragmented
nuclei in cells treated with GOS+VPA compared with each
agent alone (Figure 2A and 2B). Flow cytometric analysis
showed a similar increase in the rates of sub-G0/G1
DNA peaks (i.e., apoptotic peaks) in GOS+VPA-treated
cells (Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B). To further
explore biochemical markers of apoptosis, we assayed
the activation of caspase-3. Immunoblotting revealed
that GOS and VPA co-treatment robustly induced
caspase-3 activation in A375 and HeLa cells in a VPA
dose-dependent manner, whereas GOS or VPA alone
did not (Figure 2C). However, such caspase-3 activation
was barely seen in PC-3 cells, which is consistent with
previous observations that caspase-7, but not caspase-3,
participates in Fas-mediated apoptosis in PC-3 cells
[20]. We thus analyzed the cleavage of PARP, a substrate
of caspase-3/-7. As expected, GOS and VPA cotreatment induced PARP cleavage in all three cell lines
(Figure 2C). Together, these data indicated that GOS and
VPA synergistically induced apoptosis in all tested cells.
As GOS or VPA alone can induce macroautophagy
(hereafter referred to as autophagy) in various cancer
cells [21–23], we also asked whether autophagy induction
had any influences on apoptosis elicited by GOS+VPA.
Indeed, GOS or VPA induced autophagy as revealed by
increased levels of LC3-II and co-localization of punctate
LC3 with the lysosome marker LAMP2; GOS and VPA
co-treatment resulted in a higher level of autophagy
(Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B). To explore the
influence of autophagy on GOS+VPA-induced apoptosis,
we treated cells with VPA, GOS or their combination
in the presence of autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine
(3-MA) and apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometric
analysis of sub-G0/G1 peak rates. Interestingly, the
synergistic apoptosis was largely unaffected by 3-MA cotreatment (Supplementary Figure S3C). This suggested
that autophagy might have a minimal effect on GOS +
VPA-induced apoptosis in the current setting.
Although our focus was on the combined effects
of GOS and VPA, we extended the combination to other
HDAC inhibitors, including SAHA and tubacin. SAHA

RESULTS
GOS and noncytotoxic-dose VPA synergistically
inhibit cancer cell proliferation
GOS has been reported to inhibit the proliferation
of various cancer cells [10, 19]. To evaluate the inhibitory
effect of GOS on the growth of human A375, HeLa, and
PC-3 cancer cells, we performed a WST-1 assay in cells
treated with this agent for 24 h. The results showed that
GOS dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of these
cells (Figure 1A). The IC50 values of GOS were 43.3 ± 0.7
μM, 37.1 ± 1.4 μM, and 28.5 ± 0.9 μM for A375, HeLa,
and PC-3 cells, respectively.
As our previous study has shown that VPA
synergistically enhances the cytotoxicity of GOS in
DU145 cells [18], we currently extended our investigation
to A375, HeLa, and PC-3 cells. A low dose of VPA
(1 mM) alone had no significant effects on these cancer
cells (Figure 1B). However, this noncytotoxic dose of
VPA strongly enhanced the inhibitory effects of GOS in
all these cells (Figure 1B). To further determine whether
the observed effects of VPA and GOS are additive or
synergistic, these data were analyzed by CalcuSyn
software. The combination indexes (CI) of VPA (1 mM) in
combination with three doses of GOS (15, 30, and 45 μM)
were mostly between 0.3 and 0.7 (Figure 1C), indicating
a strong synergy between GOS and VPA (+++, 0.3 < CI
< 0.7). Moreover, to corroborate the cytotoxicity assay,

has been approved for treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
[24] and is identified as a pan-inhibitor for class I and
class II HDACs (including HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 6) [25],
while tubacin is a HDAC6-selective inhibitor [26]. As
expected, these inhibitors could counteract GOS-induced
decrease in the acetylation levels of histones H3K9 and
H4K16, with SAHA being the most effective among
them (Supplementary Figure S4A). However, GOS in
combination with SAHA or tubacin neither significantly
increased apoptosis as compared with GOS alone
(Supplementary Figure S4B) nor activated caspase-3
(Supplementary Figure S4C). These results suggested
that VPA might act in synergy with GOS via a potential
mechanism other than its impact on histone acetylation.

We next sought to explore the potential action
mechanism(s) for the synergistic induction of apoptosis
by GOS+VPA. Given the observations that GOS affects
cell cycle progression in various cancer cells [10, 27],
we tested whether VPA potentiated GOS to arrest cell
cycle progression. Flow cytometry showed that GOS
or VPA alone arrested cells in G0/G1 and G2/M phase,
respectively (Supplementary Figure S2C). Unexpectedly,
their combination only slightly changed the ratios of cells
in G0/G1 and G2/M phase. As cyclins play critical roles
in regulating cell cycle progression, we then examined

blotting revealed that GOS+VPA co-treatment consistently

It has been reported that cyclin A2 increases the
activity of Akt by phosphorylation of specific sites at
its C-terminal via cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2)
activity [28] and that activated Akt can drive cellular
proliferation and protect cells from apoptosis [29]. These

findings prompted us to evaluate whether GOS+VPAinduced downregulation of cyclin A2 was associated
with a reduction in Akt signaling. Western blotting
revealed that Akt phosphorylation on Thr308 (indicative
of Akt activity), but not total Akt protein, was reduced
by VPA+GOS treatment in a VPA dose-dependent
manner, mirroring cyclin A2 expression levels, whereas
VPA or GOS alone did not have significant effects on
Akt signaling or only slightly decreased it (Figure 3A
and 3B). Taken together, these data indicated that GOS
in combination with VPA induced the downregulation of
cyclin A2, which was correlated with the decrease of Akt
activity in cancer cells.

cells (Figure 4A and 4B). As dephosphorylation leads
to the activation of FOXO3a transcriptional activity, we
subsequently detected the expression of FOXO3a target
genes. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that
GOS and VPA co-treatment substantially increased the
mRNA levels of multiple pro-apoptotic and cycle-related
genes, including Bim, FasL, and p27Kip1, compared with
each drug alone (Figure 4C). Western blot analysis showed
that the protein levels of Bim were markedly increased
by GOS and VPA co-treatment compared with each
agent alone (Figure 4D), validating the qPCR result. As
FasL and Bim can respectively activate the extrinsic and
intrinsic apoptotic pathways, these data suggested that
combined GOS and VPA treatment might simultaneously
activate both apoptotic pathways.

The forkhead FOXO family members, including
FOXO3a, are important transcription factors downstream
of Akt signaling [30]. In view of the fact that FOXO3a
regulates the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, such as
Bim and FasL [31], we next examined whether GOS in
combination with VPA affected the FOXO3a signaling
pathway. Western blotting showed that GOS and VPA
co-treatment resulted in decreased phosphorylation of

To further investigate the mechanism underlying
GOS+VPA-induced apoptosis, we examined protein
levels of Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2 and Bax by Western
blot analysis. Co-treatment with GOS and VPA led to
a significant decrease in Bcl-2 and a slight increase in
Bax expression (Figure 5A). Notably, GOS and VPA cotreatment caused a marked reduction in the Bcl-2/Bax ratio

FOXO3a knockdown attenuates GOS+VPAinduced activation of both apoptotic pathways

(Figure 5B), which is a critical determinant of apoptosis. In
addition, survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis
protein (IAP) family, was also dramatically decreased by
GOS+VPA co-treatment in these cells (Figure 5A and 5B).
Together with increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bim,
these results suggested that GOS and VPA co-treatment
could activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
To further validate that GOS+VPA could activate
not only the intrinsic apoptotic pathway but also the
extrinsic apoptotic pathway, we determined whether GOS
plus VPA activated caspase-8 and caspase-9. Indeed,
GOS+VPA profoundly induced caspase-8 and caspase-9
cleavage in a VPA dose-dependent manner, reflecting the
activation of caspase-8 (a marker of the extrinsic pathway)
and caspase-9 (a marker of the intrinsic pathway), whereas
GOS or VPA alone did not (Figure 5C). Altogether, these
results indicated that GOS acted in synergy with VPA to
trigger both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in
all tested cancer cells.

We next sought to confirm the role of FOXO3a in
GOS+VPA-induced apoptosis by using small interfering
RNA (siRNA). Knockdown with FOXO3a-specific
siRNA resulted in more than 70% decrease in its protein
levels. qPCR analysis showed that FOXO3a knockdown
markedly diminished GOS+VPA-induced expression of
Bim and FasL mRNAs as compared with negative control
(Figure 6A). Furthermore, GOS+VPA-induced activation
of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 was dramatically
attenuated by FOXO3a knockdown (Figure 6B and 6C).
Knockdown of FOXO3a also decreased the extent of
GOS+VPA-induced irregular morphology and cell
rounding as compared with negative control (Figure 6D).
These data indicated that FOXO3a had a critical role
in GOS+VPA-induced activation of both extrinsic and
intrinsic apoptotic pathways.

GOS and VPA co-treatment induces cyclin A2
degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway

corroborating the role of cyclin A2 in regulating the Akt/
FOXO3a signaling axis.
Moreover, GOS+VPA-induced decrease in cell
viability was also partly restored by MG132 (Figure 7C).
Next, we detected caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage
by Western blotting. When A375 and HeLa cells were cotreated with GOS and VPA in the presence of MG132,
the levels of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP were markedly
decreased (Figure 7D). Although it has been shown to
induce apoptosis in various cancer cells [33, 34], MG132
alone did not induce apoptosis in our experimental setting
(Figure 7D). These data suggested that the GOS+VPAinduced cyclin A2 degradation was at least partly mediated
by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that this process
was critical for the synergistic induction of apoptosis.

We next explored the underlying mechanism for
GOS+VPA-induced cyclin A2 downregulation. To this
end, we first detected cyclin A2 mRNA levels using qPCR
assay. The mRNA levels of cyclin A2 in GOS+VPAtreated cells were comparable to those in control,
GOS- or VPA-treated cells (Figure 7A), suggesting that
GOS+VPA-induced downregulation of cyclin A2 might
be at the posttranscriptional level. As cyclin A2 protein
levels can be regulated by post-translational modification
including ubiquitination [32], we assayed whether cyclin
A2 was degraded in GOS+VPA-treated cells through
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The proteasome
inhibitor MG132 could suppress GOS+VPA-induced
downregulation of cyclin A2 (Figure 7B), indicating
that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway was involved in
cyclin A2 degradation. Concomitant with the restoration
of cyclin A2 levels, the phosphorylation levels of Akt
and FOXO3a were also reversed by MG132 (Figure 7B),

anticancer potency of GOS and VPA co-treatment.
Administration with GOS (20 mg/kg/d) or VPA (200 mg/
kg/d) alone slightly (but not significantly) decreased the
growth of xenografted tumors, whereas GOS and VPA
combination significantly suppressed the growth of
xenografted tumors (Figure 8A and 8B). No significant
weight loss and death were recorded during the course
of treatment (Supplementary Figure S5). These results
indicated that GOS could act in synergy with VPA to
suppress the growth of human xenografted tumors in
nude mice.

HDAC inhibitor that could enhance the capacity of GOS
to induce apoptosis. This combined action of GOS and
VPA was largely mediated by suppressing the cyclin-A2/
Akt/FOXO3a signaling pathway (Figure 9).
Cancer cells usually possess or acquire resistance
to apoptosis, thus refractory to single-agent chemotherapy
or radiotherapy [35, 36]. Consistent with this notion,
we found that GOS alone could only induce low levels
of apoptosis, although it significantly inhibited cell
proliferation. Such resistance to apoptosis may be due to
high expression levels of anti-apoptotic proteins including
Bcl-2 and survivin in these cells, which remained high
after GOS treatment (Figure 5A). Moreover, the high
levels of Akt signaling, which promotes the survival
of cancer cells [37, 38], was minimally influenced by
GOS alone. However, GOS and VPA co-treatment had
overcome this anti-apoptotic mechanism at least partly
by decreasing the phosphorylation levels of Akt and
its downstream substrate FOXO3a. It is believed that
reduced phosphorylation of FOXO transcription factors
leads to their activation, thus upregulating the expression
of their target genes [30] but blocking the expression

DISCUSSION
In line with our previous observations in DU145
cells [18], we found in this study that noncytotoxic doses
of VPA enhanced the cytotoxicity of GOS in human
A375, HeLa, and PC-3 cancer cells, suggesting that such
synergistic effects have no apparent cell-type preference.
We further demonstrated that combined GOS and VPA
treatment induced robust apoptosis in these cancer cells.
In our experimental settings, VPA seemed to be a distinct

of survivin [39]. In line with this concept, we found
that the expression of FOXO3a target genes, including
pro-apoptotic Bim and FasL, were markedly increased,
whereas the anti-apoptotic survivin levels were sharply
decreased. It is known that FasL is a death ligand that can
trigger the extrinsic apoptotic pathway through binding
to its receptor Fas expressed on most cancer cells [40].
Thus, by downregulating anti-apoptotic components
and upregulating pro-apoptotic proteins, GOS and VPA
co-treatment induced robust activation of caspase-9,
indicative of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and
caspase-8, reflective of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway
[41]. Further supporting the critical role of FOXO3a
in this process, knockdown of FOXO3a significantly
diminished GOS+VPA-induced expression of Bim and
FasL, and attenuated the activation of both extrinsic and
intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Thus, our data indicated
that combined GOS and VPA treatment simultaneously
triggered both apoptotic pathways by suppressing the Akt/
FOXO3a signaling axis.
In keeping with previous findings that CDK2/
cyclin A2 complex is a physiologic kinase governing
Akt activation [28], we found that GOS+VPA-induced
suppression of Akt signaling was highly correlated
with the reduction of cyclin A2 levels. It is believed
that cyclin A2 is degraded through the ubiquitinproteasome pathway [32]. In line with this notion,
we showed that the proteasome inhibitor MG132
significantly reversed the downregulation of cyclin
A2. When such downregulation of cyclin A2 levels
was reversed by MG132, the phosphorylation of Akt
and FOXO3a was restored and the apoptosis was
attenuated, further confirming the link between cyclin
A2 and Akt. Based on these observations, it is concluded

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that GOS and VPA co-treatment induces apoptosis by
suppressing the cyclin-A2/Akt/FOXO3a signaling
pathway. In addition, these observations also suggest
that cyclin A2 expression may confer cancer cells
resistance to apoptosis. In support of this hypothesis,
loss of cyclin A2 and CDK2 in oncogene-transformed
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) leads to cell
apoptosis and suppresses their ability to form tumors in
immunocompromised mice [42]. Collectively, our data
indicate that GOS in combination with VPA overcomes
the resistance of cancer cells to apoptosis at least partly
by inducing cyclin A2 degradation and downregulating
Akt signaling. Yet further research is necessary to reveal
the precise mechanism underlying GOS+VPA-induced
cyclin A2 degradation.
GOS has been investigated in clinic as a
contraceptive for males in China several decades ago
[43]. Over the past decades, GOS re-attracts scientific
attention due to the finding of its anticancer activities
and its tolerance to humans [44–47]. However, it is
only partly effective in inducing cell death at high doses
[14]. Our finding that noncytotoxic doses of VPA could
strongly enhance apoptosis in cancer cells treated with
GOS has clinical implications, as such effects of VPA
were observed in the concentrations between 0.1 mM
and 1 mM, which are achievable and tolerable in vivo
in humans with acceptable side effects [48]. In addition,
we also provided evidence showing in vivo inhibitory
effect of combined GOS and VPA treatment on the
growth of xenografted tumors. Further clinical research
is thus warranted to validate our in vitro and animal
studies.
In summary, we provided evidence that, in
addition to modulating Bcl-2 family members, GOS

Figure 9: A schematic depicts the action mechanism by which GOS and VPA synergistically activate both extrinsic
and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. GOS and VPA co-treatment promotes cyclin A2 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway,
leading to attenuated Akt signaling. Decreased Akt signaling in turn results in dephosphorylation of FOXO3a and thereby activation of
FOXO3a transcriptional activity leading to upregulation of FOXO3a target genes for apoptosis. Furthermore, GOS and VPA decrease the
ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, resulting in release of cytochrome c (Cyto c) and activation of caspase-9. GOS and VPA combination also inhibits
the expression of survivin. The overall outcome of GOS and VPA co-treatment is the activation of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic
pathways, leading to robust apoptosis. The as-yet-uncharacterized processes for GOS+VPA-induced downregulation of cyclin A2 and
Bcl-2 are indicated by dotted lines.

in combination with VPA increased the expression of
FasL and Bim by downregulating the cyclin-A2/Akt/
FOXO3a pathway. By suppressing this pro-survival
signaling pathway, GOS and VPA co-treatment may
lower the apoptotic threshold, thereby rendering the

chemo-resistant cancer cells more susceptible to
apoptosis. Our study suggests that the combination
of GOS and VPA constitutes a promising therapeutic
regimen for certain human cancers with chemoresistance.

Analysis of cell cycle was performed as described
previously [18]. In brief, cells were fixed with 70%
ethanol and stained with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
containing 50 μg/ml PI and 30 μg/ml RNase A. DNA
content data were acquired using CELLQuest software
on a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur; Becton-Dickinson,
Mountain View, CA, USA). A minimum of 20,000 events
was collected for each sample.

Immunofluorescence microscopy
Immunofluorescent staining was performed as
described previously [49]. Cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with ice-cold 100%
methanol, and immunostained with LC3B and LAMP2
(ab25631; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) antibodies
followed by incubation with CF488A-conjugated
goat-anti-mouse IgG (#20018) and CF568-conjugated
goat-anti-rabbit IgG (#20103), highly cross-absorbed
(Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA). Nuclei were revealed
by Hoechst 33342 staining. Fluorescence images were
collected under a Leica DMIRB fluorescent microscope
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with
a Spinning Disk Confocal Microscopy system (UltraView
cooled CCD; Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA).

Cell culture and treatment

Quantitative PCR

Human cancer A375, PC-3 and HeLa cell lines
were obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). A375 and HeLa
Cells were maintained in DMEM while PC-3 cells were
maintained in RPMI-1640, supplemented with 10% FBS,
100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C
in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and sub-cultured
every 2–3 d. In all experiments, cells in log-phase were
seeded for 24 h and the medium was replaced with fresh
medium with or without drugs.

Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed
on a Chromo4 four-color real-time PCR detection system
(Bio-Rad). qPCR for each sample was performed twice
in triplicates using a 20-μl reaction system containing
50 ng initial total RNA. Both annealing and extending
temperature were set to 60°C. Forty PCR cycles were run
and the melting curves were recorded. The primers used
are as follows: 5′-GAAGAGAGGGAACCACAGCA-3′
(sense) and, 5′-TTGCCTGTTAAATGGGCCAC-3′ (antisense) for FasL; 5′-TCATCGCGGTATTCGGTTCG-3′
(sense) and 5′-CTTCACCTCCGTGATTGCCT-3′ (antisense) for Bim; 5′-ACGGGGTTAGCGGAGCAA-3′
(sense) and 5′-ATGTCCATTCCATGAAGTCAGC-3′
(anti-sense) for p27Kip1; 5′-CCTCCTTGGAAAGCAAA
CAGTAAA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ACACTCACTGGCT
TTTCATCTTC-3′ (anti-sense) for cyclin A2; 5′-AGAT
CTGGCACCACACCTTCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTTTG
ATGTCACGCACGATTT-3′ (anti-sense) for β-actin.
All other parameters for the reaction system and the
PCR program were set according to the manufacturer’s
protocol for the SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR kit (Takara,
Dalian, China). The specificity of PCR was determined
by a following melting curve analysis. The relative

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was measured using the WST-1 assay
kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 50%
inhibition concentration (IC50) indicates the concentration
corresponding to 50% reduction of cell proliferation
as compared with control cells. Cells in log-phase were
seeded in 96-well plates (3500 cells/well) for 24 h and
then treated with indicated concentrations of GOS and/
or VPA. After 24 h, 10 μl of WST-1 reagent was added
to each well and the plates were incubated for 0.5–2 h
at 37°C. The absorbance at 450 nm with a reference at

conditions in microisolator cages. The animals were
acclimated for 1 week before experiments. Animal
experiments were conducted following the National
Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by
the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of
Jinan University. Human melanoma A375 cells (1 × 106
cells/100 μl in PBS) in the logarithmic growth phase
were subcutaneously inoculated in the right flank of
nude mice. When tumors were detectable (about 6 days
after inoculation) (set as day 0), mice were administrated
consecutively with vehicle (2% Tween-80 in PBS), VPA
(200 mg/kg/d), GOS (20 mg/kg/d), or VPA and GOS
combination via gavage, respectively. The dosages
GOS and VPA used in this in vivo experiment were
based on previous reports [50, 51] and our preliminary
experiments, showing that combined GOS and VPA
of such doses had no apparent toxic to mice. Tumor
volume (V) was measured with a caliper once every 2
days and calculated with the formula V = (L × W2)/2,
where L represents larger diameter and W represents
smaller diameter. At the end of experiments, mice were
euthanized by CO2 inhalation and tumor tissues were
harvested for weighting.

Protein extraction
Cells were washed thoroughly with ice-cold PBS
and lysed with 2 × sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) loading buffer. Lysates
were sonicated, boiled and clarified by centrifugation at
12,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was
measured by SDS-PAGE with a known sample determined
by a BCA protein assay kit (#23227; Pierce) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were quickly
frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80°C until
use.

Western blot analysis
Samples containing 30 μg of total protein were
separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF
membrane. After incubation in blocking buffer (50 mM
Tris-buffered saline (pH7.4) containing 5% nonfat dry
milk and 0.1% Tween-20), the membranes were probed
with indicated primary antibodies, followed by incubation
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, #111–035003) or goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch,
115–035-003). Bands were revealed with an enhanced
chemiluminescence kit (#P0018; Beyotime, Haimen,
China) and recorded on X-ray films (Kodak, Xiamen,
China). Images were captured using FluorChem 8000
imaging system (AlphaInnotech; San Leandro, CA, USA)
and the densitometry of each band was quantified using
AlphaEaseFC software ((AlphaInnotech).

Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed at least three
times, with one representative experiment shown. Data
were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (S.D.).
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
5 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Oneway ANOVA, followed by the Tukey post-hoc test was
used to analyze the statistical significance among multiple
groups and a P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
