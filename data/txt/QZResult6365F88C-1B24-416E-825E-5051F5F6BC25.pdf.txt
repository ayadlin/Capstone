ABSTRACT
Angiogenesis plays a critical role in the growth and metastasis of tumors, which
makes it an attractive target for anti-tumor drug development. Deoxypodophyllotoxin
(DPT), a natural product isolated from Anthriscus sylvestris, inhibits cell proliferation
and migration in various cancer cell types. Our previous studies indicate that DPT
possesses both anti-angiogenic and vascular-disrupting activities. Although the RhoA/
RhoA kinase (ROCK) signaling pathway is implicated in DPT-stimulated cytoskeleton
remodeling and tumor vasculature suppressing, the detailed mechanisms by which
DPT mediates these effects are poorly understood. In the current study, we found
that DPT promotes cytoskeleton remodeling in human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVECs) via stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and that this
effect is abolished by either treatment with a selective AMPK inhibitor or knockdown.
Moreover, the cellular levels of LKB1, a kinase upstream of AMPK, were enhanced
following DPT exposure. DPT-induced activation of AMPK in tumor vasculature effect
was also verified by transgenic zebrafish (VEGFR2:GFP), Matrigel plug assay, and
xenograft model in nude mice. The present findings may lay the groundwork for a
novel therapeutic approach in treating cancer.

where angiogenesis most vigorously occurs, and few

apoptotic effects against a broad variety of tumors both
in vitro and in vivo [7-10]. DPT promotes cytoskeletal
remodeling and possesses both anti-angiogenic and
vascular-disrupting activities. Although the Rho A / Rho
A kinase (ROCK) pathway has been implicated in these
effects [11], the underlying mechanisms behind these
activities are poorly understood.
One emerging concept regarding the mechanism
of tumorigenesis is that metabolic changes not only
participate in but also critically impact the excessive
proliferation of tumor cells [12, 13]. In particular, AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK), a highly conserved
protein kinase regulating mammalian metabolism, has
been increasingly recognized as a central regulator in the
physiological development of tumor cells [14]. AMPK
activators suppress the incidence and development of
tumors in some model systems [15, 16]. However, AMPK
activation is emerging as a master molecular switch that
promotes cytoskeletal remodeling in various cell types [17,
18]. To the best of our knowledge, no reports regarding
the effects of AMPK-induced cytoskeletal remodeling on
tumor vasculature have been previously published.
In the present study, we investigated the potential
role and underlying mechanisms of DPT as an effective
VTA in the treatment of tumors. We found that DPT
promotes cytoskeletal remodeling in human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) via AMPK stimulation.
We further demonstrated that LKB1-dependent AMPK
activation is an unrecognized and important mechanism
by which DPT promotes cytoskeletal remodeling.

used for this study (Supplementary Figure 1). These data
indicated that cytoskeletal remodeling accompanied by
actin polymerization and microtubule depolymerization
account for DPT’s ability to suppress tumor vasculature.

RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway is involved in
DPT-induced cytoskeletal remodeling and its
relationship with actin and tubulin
Rho/Rho kinase signalling pathway is a critical
regulator of cytoskeleton and cell behaviour. To confirm
the mechanism by which DPT induced cytoskeletal
remodeling, we examined RhoA activity in HUVECs
lysates using a commercial G-LISA kit. RhoA activation
peaked 15 min after DPT exposure (1 μM) and then
slightly declined (Figure 2A). DPT also increased the
phosphorylation of cytoskeletal proteins, especially
regulatory coﬁlin and myosin light chains (MLCs) (Figure
2B), two key elements involved in actin cytoskeletal
contraction and polymerization. The ROCK inhibitor
Y27632 prevented DPT-induced stress fiber formation
(Figure 2C), suggesting that activation of RhoA/ROCK
signaling pathway is upstream of actin polymerization.
Consistent with these results, RhoA knockdown by
siRNA markedly decreased stress fiber formation (Figure
2D and 2E). Taxol, a well-known microtubule stabilizer,
completely inhibited DPT-induced RhoA activation and
actin stress fiber formation (Figure 2F and 2G), indicating
that microtubule depolymerization triggered activation of
RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway.

RESULTS

AMPK activation is involved in DPT-mediated
cytoskeletal remodeling in HUVECs

DPT-induced cell contraction is accompanied
by actin polymerization and microtubule
depolymerization

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a member
of the MARK/PAR kinase subfamily (microtubule
affinity-regulating kinase), has been recently recognized
as a master molecular switch that promotes cytoskeletal
remodeling. In the current study, we investigated the
effects of the specific AMPK inhibitor compound C and
AMPK siRNA on DPT-induced tubulin depolymerization
and its downstream events. DPT strongly promoted the
activation of AMPK in HUVECs. This effect was inhibited
by the specific AMPK inhibitor compound C (Figure 3A).
Interestingly, DPT-induced microtubule depolymerization
and actin polymerization were reversed by compound C
(Figure 3B and 3C). Additionally, this chemical inhibition
also reversed RhoA activation mediated by DPT (Figure
3D). Consistent with the above results, AMPK protein
levels were significantly decreased in HUVECs after
transfection with AMPK siRNA for 24 h (Figure 3E-3H),
demonstrating that DPT-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling
is AMPK-dependent.

It has been suggested that changes in endothelial
cell morphology may be associated with vascular
targeting activities. Cell contraction and cytoskeletal
remodeling may cause obstruction of cell migration and
increase in vascular resistance. DPT promoted actin
stress fiber formation in HUVECs in a dose- and timedependent manner (Figure 1A and 1B). DPT also disrupted
microtubule dynamics in HUVECs in a time-dependent
manner (Figure 1C). Moreover, rapid contractions were
observed in DPT-treated cells using live-cell microscopy.
This response was evident from the retraction of the cell
margins, and the cell membrane integrity was eradicated
after 3 h (white arrows, Figure 1D). However, the loss
of membrane integrity was not observed in HUVECs
treated with taxol, the natural microtubule stabilizer
used as control (Figure 1D). Meanwhile, we confirmed
that DPT didn’t induce apoptosis at the concentrations

LKB1-dependent AMPK activation is involved
in DPT-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling in
HUVECs

DPT prevents intersegmental vessel formation in
zebrafish via AMPK activation
Zebraﬁsh is a widely used model organism for
studies of angiogenesis. The exposure of zebrafish
embryos, which express green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)
in the developing vasculature, to DPT clearly caused blood
vessel regression in the intersegmental vessel formation
(ISVs) compared to control group. However, this effect
was remarkably abolished by compound C which had no
effect on the ISVs in zebrafish at the applied dosage in
zebrafish (Figure 5).

Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and calmodulin-dependent
protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) are upstream kinases
which activate AMPK. In HUVECs, DPT activates LKB1
(as indicated by increased LKB1 phosphorylation) but
not CaMKKβ (Figure 4A). Furthermore, AMPK was
not activated by DPT treatment in LKB1-deficient HeLa
cells (Figure 4B), indicating that LKB1 is the primary
upstream kinase of AMPK in HUVECs. To further
examine the potential role of LKB1 in AMPK-dependent
RhoA activation, LKB1 was obviously expressed in Hela
cells using plasmid transduction (HeLa LKB1). No LKB1
was detected in HeLa cells transfected with plasmid
vector alone (HeLa Vec) (Figure 4C). RhoA and AMPK
were significantly activated following DPT exposure
in Hela LKB1 (Figure 4D and 4E). Consistently, LKB1
knockdown by siRNA in HUVECs markedly attenuated
DPT-mediated AMPK phosphorylation, RhoA activation
and cytoskeletal remodeling (Figure 4F-4J). However,
pretreatment with the specific CaMKKβ inhibitor STO609 did not prevent AMPK activation and cytoskeletal
remodeling induced by DPT in HUVECs (Supplementary
Figure 2). Altogether, these results indicate that LKB1
activation promoted AMPK-dependent cytoskeletal
remodeling in HUVECs treated with DPT.

DPT exerts an anti-angiogenesis effect via AMPK
activation in Matrigel plug assay
We further evaluated the vascular disruptive effects
of DPT in vivo using Matrigel plug assays. In mice
receiving the vehicle control for two weeks, the plugs
that were injected into the flanks of the mice became
red, indicating the occurrence of vasifaction (Figure
6A). Integrated vascular lumen structures were observed
by H&E staining (Figure 6B). However, plugs removed
from DPT-treated mice were clear and pale, yellow
in appearance, and no vascular lumen structures were
observed. Notably, the vascular formation effects mediated
by DPT were markedly reduced by compound C.

DPT exerts anti-tumor and anti-vasculature effect
via AMPK activation in xenograft mouse model

findings of our study are as follows: 1) DPT promotes
cytoskeletal remodeling in HUVEC cells; 2) the molecular
mechanism involved includes AMPK activation; and 3)
LKB1 but not CaMKKβ is the upstream kinase involved
in DPT-mediated AMPK activation.
Similarly to normal tissues, tumors require
nourishment in the form of oxygen and nutrients as well
as the ability to evacuate carbon dioxide and metabolic
waste. The tumor vasculature generated by the process
of angiogenesis addresses these needs [19]. The majority
of tumors are unable to grow beyond a microscopic size
of 1 to 2 mm3 without blood vessels [20, 21]. Therefore,
targeting tumor vasculature is considered as a promising
strategy to suppress tumor growth. More than 40 agents
targeting tumor vasculature have been subjected to
clinical trials [22, 23]. However, a lack of effect of
angiogenesis inhibitors on existing tumor vessels shifted
the focus to exploiting vascular-disrupting agents such as
combretastatin A-4 phosphate which targets microtubules
and is currently in phase I/II/III clinical trials [24].
DPT causes cytoskeletal remodeling and has both
anti-angiogenic and vascular-disrupting activities at nontoxic doses [11]. Although RhoA/ROCK pathway has
been shown to be implicated in DPT-induced suppression
of tumor vasculature, the molecular mechanisms involved
have not been fully characterized [11].
The development and functional maintenance of
tumor vasculature involves the growth of new endothelial
cells and their assembly into tubes (vasculogenesis) in
addition to the sprouting (angiogenesis) of new vessels
from existing ones [25]. Various components of the
cytoskeleton (especially microtubules and microﬁlaments)
play important roles in this process. Microﬁlaments are
contractile structures consisting of actin molecules either
in ﬁlamentous (F-actin) or monomeric (G-actin) forms.
The monomeric status of the actin cytoskeleton facilitates

To confirm the effect of DPT on tumor growth
and tumor vasculature, we examined its in vivo efficacy
using SGC-7901 xenograft model, which is known to be
sensitive to DPT therapy [10]. As depicted in Figure 7A,
DPT treatment significantly suppressed tumor growth
with an inhibition rate of 78% compared to control mice
group (Figure 7A). Microvessel Density (MVD) of tumor
sections was also dramatically decreased following DPT
exposure (Figure 7C and 7D). No obviously damage
was observed on the liver and gastric section of the host
mouse (Supplementary Figure 3). Additionally, DPT did
not affect mice body weight (Figure 7B) or cause other
side effects. In contrast to DPT, compound C resulted in an
obviously decrease of mice body weight at the end of the
treatment-period. To further explore the in vivo molecular
mechanism of DPT, p-AMPK staining and activated RhoA
level were evaluated in solid tumors. Consistent with
the results of the in vitro study, DPT caused significant
increase of p-AMPK staining and RhoA activation (Figure
7E and 7F). Furthermore, compound C obviously reduced
DPT-induced AMPK phosphorylation, RhoA activation,
and tumor growth suppression, which is similar to the
effects in the above experiment. These data confirmed
that the in vivo inhibitory effects of DPT on tumor growth
and tumor vasculature are mediated by AMPK-dependent
RhoA activation.

DISCUSSION
The present study was designed to determine
whether DPT can act as a tumor vascular targeting agent
by inducing cytoskeletal remodeling and to clarify the
molecular mechanisms of such effect. The principal

endothelial cell migration [23]. DPT mediates an increase
of F-actin and its subsequent assembly to form actin
stress fibers accompanied by diffusion of microtubule
network. DPT-mediated cell contraction was also observed
through time-lapse imaging. Taken together, our results
demonstrated that the anti-vascular effect of DPT results
from its action on promoting cytoskeletal remodeling.
Endothelial cell contraction associated with stress
fiber formation via Rho/Rho kinase pathway contributes
to the vascular-disrupting activity [26]. Rho A activates
the serine/threonine kinase ROCK which indirectly
phosphorylates cytoskeletal proteins such as MLCs and
cofilin and controls actin cytoskeletal contraction [27,28].
In the present study, we investigated whether the RhoA/
ROCK pathway regulates DPT-induced cytoskeletal
remodeling. Our data revealed that DPT significantly
increased the levels of GTP-bound RhoA (the active form
of RhoA) in HUVECs. Additionally, time-dependent
increases in MLC and cofilin phosphorylation were
observed after DPT treatment. Treatment with either a

ROCK antagonist or RhoA siRNA completely inhibited
the effects of DPT on the actin cytoskeleton, indicating
that mechanisms beyond RhoA activation contribute to the
beneficial effects of DPT.
The loss of microtubules may result in the release
of microtubule-associated proteins, thereby leading to
the activation of RhoA [29]. Therefore, the possible
relationship between tubulin and RhoA was also studied
in this study. Incubation with taxol, a tubulin stabilizer,
completely inhibited the effects of DPT on RhoA and
actin. Consequently, the possible relationship between
these proteins with regards to the effects of DPT on the
cytoskeleton involves tubulin-RhoA/ROCK-actin. Despite
the fact that overexpression of RhoA was reported in many
cancer types, the actual role of RhoA in tumor progression
depends on context [30]. In most cases, RhoA activation
carries out the tumor vasculature suppressing effect of
microtubule destabilizer when it is a downstream effector
of microtubule depolymerization, consistent with our
findings [3,11].
AMPK is a member of the MARK (microtubule
afﬁnity-regulating kinase)/PAR kinase subfamily, which
phosphorylates microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) to
inﬂuence microtubule dynamics and cell polarity [31-33].
Both synthetic and natural compounds that activate the
AMPK pathway can promote cytoskeletal remodeling [18,
33-35]. However, investigations regarding the regulatory
relationship between AMPK and the cytoskeleton are
limited, and the mechanisms remain largely undefined.
Moreover, it is unclear whether AMPK is a key regulator
in tumor angiogenesis and whether the beneficial effect
of DPT on promoting cytoskeletal remodeling is due
to its activation of AMPK. We further investigated the
mechanisms underlying DPT-promoted cytoskeletal
remodeling. We observed that DPT robustly increased
AMPK activation in HUVECs. Moreover, exposure to
either an AMPK inhibitor or siRNA completely inhibited
DPT-mediated tubulin depolymerization in HUVECs.
However, actin polymerization is the downstream event
of tubulin depolymerization and RhoA activation. The
regulatory mechanisms among tubulin, Rho GTPases and
actin are complicated. Actin polymerization sometimes
are only in part through release of the depolymerized
microtubule protein [29]. So AMPK siRNA seems to
partially inhibit DPT-mediated actin formation. The in vivo
zebrafish studies also validate DPT-mediated targeting
tumor vasculature effects through enhanced AMPK
activation [36]. DPT significantly inhibited intersegmental
vessel formation (ISV) formation in transgenic zebrafish
[Tg (VEGFR2:GFP)]. However, compound C (CC),
a selective AMPK inhibitor, results in ISV defects at
doses of 5 μM and 10 μM. Thus, we selected a dose of
10 nM, which partially dampens the DPT-mediated antiangiogenesis effect in zebrafish. CC doses exceeding 100
nM exert synergistic anti-angiogenesis effects with DPT
(data not shown). Interestingly, consistent with results

obtained in zebrafish, DPT exhibited an inhibitory effect on
vascular formation in the Matrigel plug assay, a proverbial
model to assess tumor neovascularization [37] and in the
xenograft mouse model. Moreover, no obviously damage
was observed on the normal tissue sections. The selective
effects of DPT on tumor vasculature perhaps result from
the abnormalities of tumor vasculature [1]. Collectively,
these results support the fact that DPT suppresses tumor
vasculature through promoting cytoskeletal remodeling
via AMPK signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo.
AMPK is activated by the upstream AMPK kinases
(AMPKK), LKB1 and CaMKKβ [38-41]. We investigated
the effect of DPT on these upstream kinases and found
that DPT promoted AMPK activation in HeLa cells
transfected with plasmid encoding for LKB1. In addition,
LKB1 siRNA blocked DPT-mediated AMPK activation in
HUVECs, suggesting that LKB1 is the upstream kinase
through which DPT activated AMPK. However, DPT
significantly induced LKB1 and AMPK phosphorylation
after 10-15 min exposure, while the tubulin destruction
and F-actin formation elicited by DPT was observed at
as early as 7.5 min. Cytoskeleton staining was therefore
operated in HUVECs pretreated with AMPK siRNA for
24 h followed by DPT treatment for 7.5 min. As shown
in Supplementary Figure 4, AMPK siRNA reversed
DPT-mediated cytoskeletal remodeling. In contrast,
the CaMKKβ pharmacological inhibitor STO-609 did
not block the effect of DPT (Supplementary Figure 2),
suggesting that DPT promoted cytoskeletal remodeling
through the LKB1-AMPK pathway.
AMPK has been termed the fuel sensor of
mammalian cells and its activation considered as tumor
suppressor has been reported before ten years [42,43].
However, the role of AMPK in cancer shows two faces
[44]. Some reports show that AMPK is regulated by the
tumor suppressor LKB1 and the tumor suppressors such
as TSC2 and p53 are downstream effectors of AMPK.
However, other reports show that AMPK may exert protumor effects by regulating cellular metabolic plasticity
[45,46]. A positive or negative role for AMPK in tumor
growth clearly depends on context. Moreover, AMPKdependent cytoskeletal remodeling in tumor vasculature
suppressing are few reported and whether it can be applied
as a potential vascular targeting agent deserves further
study.
A recent study reported that DPT inhibits the
initiation of tubulin polymerization in a concentrationdependent manner as assessed by the extracellular tubulin
polymerization turbidity assay, implicating that DPT
directly binds to tubulin [47]. However, the reaction
system of the extracellular tubulin polymerization turbidity
assay is not identical to that in cells. Our results revealed
that the effects of DPT on tubulin and RhoA/ROCK
pathway were completely inhibited by either an AMPK
inhibitor or AMPK siRNA. Thus, our data indicated that
tubulin-RhoA is involved in DPT-induced cytoskeletal

remodeling via downstream signaling of AMPK in
HUVECs. Whether DPT directly binds to tubulin to cause
it destruction remains to be investigated.
In conclusion, our studies demonstrated that DPT
promotes cytoskeletal remodeling via activation of the
LKB1-AMPK signaling pathway to suppress tumor
vasculature both in vivo and in vitro. Due to the therapeutic
effects and high safety profile, we expect that DPT can be
used as a starting compound to develop novel therapeutic
agents.
A new vascular network by angiogenesis is a key
driver in tumor growth and metastasis [1,22]. Nearly all
of the anti-angiogenic agents currently in development
or receiving FDA approval, preferentially target growth
factor-induced cell proliferation and migration [2].
Little is known regarding the compounds that target the
cytoskeleton changes of endothelial cells involved in
angiogenesis. Noticeably, Microtubule-targeting agents
(MTAs) thus far represent the only class of anticancer
drugs that can be successfully used in anti-angiogenesis
and vascular-disrupting strategies through cytoskeletal
remodeling [3]. Moreover, we confirmed that DPT
selectively targets tumor vasculature in xenograft tumor
model. Thus, DPT can be exploited as a tumor vascular
targeting agent to anti-tumor metastasis therapy.

Western blot analysis

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVECs) were purchased from Sciencell (San Diego,
USA). Each batch of HUVECs was examined using
immunofluorescence and was shown to be CD31 positive
(data not shown). Cells were cultured on plates coated
with 0.5% collagen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) in
complete HUVECs medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Carlsbad, CA), 1% endothelial
cell growth supplement, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/
ml streptomycin (Sciencell, San Diego, USA). HeLa
cells were cultured in DMEM (HyClone, Logan, UT),
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and
100 μg/ml streptomycin. HUVECs (passage 3-5) and Hela
cells that were approximately 70% confluent were seeded
onto 6-well or 24-well plate for further experiments.

Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Vazyme,
Jiangsu, China). Cell homogenates were centrifuged
at 13,200× rpm for 20 min. Total protein concentration
of the supernatants was assessed by BCA kit (Thermo,
Rockford, IL). Equal amounts of cell lysates were
separated on 8%-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred onto
polyvinylidenedifluoride membranes (PVDF) (Millipore;
Bedford, MA, USA). Membranes were then blocked
with 5% BSA in Tris-Buffed-Saline with Tween (TBST)
for 1 h, followed by incubation with diluted primary
antibodies (overnight, 4 °C). Membranes were washed
with 0.1% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)
and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The
immunoreactive proteins were then detected by ECL-Plus
Western Blotting Detection System.

Time-lapse microscopy
HUVECs were grown on collagen-coated 96-well
glass-bottom dishes (In Vitro Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA) at
2×104 cells/ml for 24 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 and then treated
with either 1 μM DPT or 1 μM taxol. To collect time-lapse
images, cells were observed every 2 min for 3 h using
the IncuCyte Zoom (Essen, Ann Arbor, USA), a live cell
imaging and data analysis system, in the incubator.

Measurement of activated RhoA by G-LISA
RhoA activity in HUVECs lysates and solid
tumors were assayed using a commercial G-LISA kit
(Cytoskeleton, Denver, USA) according to manufacturer
specifications and read on a Molecular Devices M-5
microplate reader.

RhoA, AMPK and LKB1 knockdown in HUVECs
by siRNA

HUVECs were seeded at 2×104 cells/ml on collagencoated coverslips and cultured for 24 h. After treatment
with DPT, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
30 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, and blocked with 5%
bovine serum albumin for 1 h to reduce nonspeciﬁc
staining. The fixed cells were then incubated with an antiα-tubulin primary antibody (4◦C, overnight) followed by
an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody for
1 h. Filamentous actin was stained with Acti-stain 555
phalloidin and nucleus was stained with Hoechst 33342
for 10 min. Fluorescence images were obtained using a

siRNA and RNA iMAX (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA) were
premixed in OPTI-medium (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and then
applied to cells. After 24 h transfection, OPTI-medium
was replaced by complete HUVECs medium. Then

treatment of DPT (20 mg/kg) and compound C (10 mg/
kg); and (d) compound C (10 mg/kg) alone. HP-β-CD,
DPT, and compound C (Selleck Chemicals, Houston,
USA) were all dissolved in normal saline. HP-β-CD and
DPT were administered intravenously, while compound
C was administered intraperitoneally. After 14 days, mice
were sacriﬁced. Matrigel plugs were removed, ﬁxed in
10% neutral-buffered formalin, processed for embedding
in parafﬁn, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin (H&E).

LKB1 overexpression in Hela cells by plasmid
transfection
HUVECs cultured in collagen coated 24-well plates
were transfected with pcDNA 3.1(+) vector or pcDNA
3.1(+) encoding for LKB1 gene (Genepharma, Shanghai,
China) when cells reached 30-40% confluence. Plasmid
and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA)
were premixed in OPTI-medium (Invitrogen, Camarillo,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
then applied to the cells. After 48 h transfection, OPTImedium was replaced by complete HUVECs medium.
Then HUVECs were treated with DPT for 30 min.

Mouse xenograft tumors study
Female Balb/c nude mice (18 to 20 g) were
purchased from Shanghai Rubicam Laboratory Animal
Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Viable SGC-7901 cells (3 × 106/
100 μl PBS per mouse) were subcutaneously (s.c.) injected
into the right flank of the nude mice. When the average
tumor volume reached 100-160 mm3, mice were randomly
divided into 4 groups and treated as described in Matrigel
plug assay. Tumor size and body weight were recorded
three times a week with a caliper (calculated volume =
shortest diameter2 ×longest diameter/2). After three weeks,
mice were sacrificed and solid tumors were removed for
further analyses.

Effect of DPT on intersegmental vessel formation
in zebrafish
Transgenic zebrafish that express green ﬂuorescent
protein (GFP) in the developing vasculature [Tg
(VEGFR2:GFP)] were maintained under standard
conditions (Nusslein-Volhard and Dahm, 2002) [48].
Embryos were obtained through natural spawning and
staged by time and morphological criteria [36]. DPT and
compound C (CC) were diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and then further diluted in fish water to the
required concentrations. Experiments were performed
in 24-well plates with 8 to 10 embryos per well in a
volume of 1 ml. The chemical treatment was applied to
24-hour-old Tg (VEGFR2:GFP) embryos in fish water
supplemented with either DMSO or CC. To characterize
the intersegmental vessel (ISVs), embryos were
dechorionated with 1 mg/ml of pronase before treatment.
Embryos were narcotized and photographed 24 h after
treatment.

Immunohistochemistry
Solid tumors or normal tissues were fixed with 10%
formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Blood vessel and
p-AMPK staining were performed on 5 μm tumor sections
with primary CD31 or p-AMPK antibody. Section images
were obtained using a confocal microscope (FV-1000;
Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Microvessel density (MVD) in
tumors was quantified as described previously [10].

Statistical analysis

Matrigel plug assay

Statistical significance was determined using
GraphPad Prism 5 software (San Diego, CA). Data are
presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses among
multiple groups were performed using one-way ANOVA
followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test. A p value less than
0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Female Balb/c nude mice (18 to 20 g) were
purchased from Shanghai Rubicam Laboratory Animal
Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Because DPT is not watersoluble, a 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD)
inclusion complex (containing 3.06% of DPT) was
prepared to further characterize its activity in vivo. The
effects of DPT on angiogenesis in vivo were monitored
using Matrigel plug assay. Prepared Matrigel (0.4 ml)
containing 80 units/ml heparin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100
ng/ml human recombinant VEGF-A165 (Peprotech, Rocky
Hill, USA) was injected subcutaneously into the ﬂanks
of mice. Animals were randomly divided into 4 groups
and administered the following regimens thrice weekly:
(a) HP-β-CD; (b) DPT (20 mg/kg) alone; (c) combination
