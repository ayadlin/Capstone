ABSTRACT
Proteasomes are attractive emerging targets for anti-cancer therapies. Auranofin
(Aur), a gold-containing compound clinically used to treat rheumatic arthritis, was
recently approved by US Food and Drug Administration for Phase II clinical trial to
treat cancer but its anti-cancer mechanism is poorly understood. Here we report that
(i) Aur shows proteasome-inhibitory effect that is comparable to that of bortezomib/
Velcade (Vel); (ii) different from bortezomib, Aur inhibits proteasome-associated
deubiquitinases (DUBs) UCHL5 and USP14 rather than the 20S proteasome; (iii)
inhibition of the proteasome-associated DUBs is required for Aur-induced cytotoxicity;
and (iv) Aur selectively inhibits tumor growth in vivo and induces cytotoxicity in
cancer cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients. This study provides important
novel insight into understanding the proteasome-inhibiting property of metalcontaining compounds. Although several DUB inhibitors were reported, this study
uncovers the first drug already used in clinic that can inhibit proteasome-associated
DUBs with promising anti-tumor effects.

INTRODUCTION

activity has been reported in many different cancers, such
as colon and prostate cancers and leukemia, suggesting
that cancer cells may rely more heavily on the UPS than
non-cancer cells. Targeting this pathway was validated as
a strategy by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration)
approval of bortezomib/Velcade (Vel) for the treatment
of relapsed multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma

The degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome
system (UPS) is a tightly regulated process responsible
for maintenance of protein homeostasis in cells. The 26S
proteasome consists of both 19S regulatory particles (RP)
and the 20S core particle (CP). Increased proteasome

[1]. Therefore, both 20S proteasome peptidases and the
19S proteasome-associated deubiquitinases (DUBs) are
becoming attractive targets of cancer therapy.
DUBs are proteases that cleave ubiquitin or
ubiquitin-like proteins from ubiquitin pro-proteins or
conjugates with target proteins. There are 98 putative
ubiquitin-specific DUBs encoded by the human genome,
which are classified to six different families based on
sequence and structural features of their DUB active
sites [2-4]. Five families belong to cysteine proteases:
ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCH), ubiquitin
specific protease (USP), ovarian tumor domain protease
(OTU), Josephin domain protease (MJD) and monocyte
chemotactic protein-induced protein family (MCPIP). The
other family of DUBs belongs to the JAB1/MPN/Mov34
metalloenzyme (JAMM) domain family of Zn2+-dependent
metalloproteases [4, 5]. Deubiquitination is implicated in
many cellular processes, including cell cycle regulation
[6], protein degradation [7], gene expression [8], and
DNA repair [9, 10]. Mutations in several DUBs have
also been linked to human diseases including cancer and
neurological disorders [5, 11-13]. In humans, three DUBs
are associated with the 19S RP. Two of them, UCHL5/
Uch37 and USP14/Ubp6, are cysteine proteases of the
UCH and USP families, respectively. The third DUB,
RPN11/POH1, is a Zn2+-dependent protease of the JAMM
family. RPN11 is a stoichiometric subunit of the lid of the
19S RP. The physiological roles of the 19S DUBs are not
completely understood. It has been suggested that RPN11
performs ubiquitin chain amputation by cleaving the entire
ubiquitin chain from the substrate in a process coupled
to degradation [14, 15]. In contrast, the two cysteinecontaining DUBs USP14 and UCHL5 trim ubiquitin
chains from the distal end in a process antagonizing
proteasomal degradation [16, 17]. It is generally believed
that USP14 and UCHL5 provide a quality control
function, ensuring short or non-degradable ubiquitinated
substrates to be released from the proteasome [18].
Several DUBs have been found to be involved in cancer
progression and therefore are emerging targets for anticancer therapies [19]. Of the three DUBs associated with
the 19S RP, RPN11 is an obvious target for drug discovery
due to its absolute requirement for cell survival [20]. The
dependence of cell viability on RPN11 has been attributed
to the DUB activity located in the JAMM motif of RPN11.
RPN11 knockdown produces a similar phenotype to
proteasome inhibition [16, 21]. In addition to RPN11,
UCHL5 and USP14 are also associated with cell survival
and cancer progession [22, 23].
We and others have reported that metal-containing
compounds could induce cytotoxicity in human cancer
cells via targeting the proteasome peptidases [24-26].
Several Zn, Cu compounds were toxic to cancer cells,
associated with inhibition of cellular 26S proteasomes.
Some of these metal compounds showed much less
inhibitory effects against purified 20S proteasomes than
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

against cellular 26S proteasomes [24, 25, 27]. It has
been proposed that inhibition of DUBs in the 19S RP is
possibly responsible for the anti-tumor effect of these
metal complexes observed in cancer cells [24, 25, 27], but
this hypothesis has not been tested.
Auranofin (Aur), a gold-containing compound,
has been used clinically to treat rheumatic arthritis
since 1985. It has also been reported that Aur has anticancer effects [28-30]. Aur was recently approved by
FDA for Phase II clinical trial in cancer therapy (http://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT01419691). However,
the mechanism underlying its anti-cancer effects remains
poorly understood. Previous studies identified several
potential molecular targets for the anti-inflammatory and
anti-cancer activities of Aur [31-36]. One of the earlier
studies suggested that Aur inhibits DNA synthesis, RNA
synthesis, and protein synthesis, while later studies added
several other targets including reactive oxygen species
(ROS), mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase, glutathioneS-transferase, and cathepsin B. When we carefully
analyzed the cytotoxic effect of Aur and its reported
mechanisms, it became apparent to us that some of the
characteristics induced by Aur are very consistent with
the changes induced by proteasome inhibition; thus we
propose that like copper compounds, Aur may target the
proteasome.
Here we provide compelling evidence that Aur,
a gold-containing compound, inhibits the proteasome
via targeting proteasome-associated DUBs but not 20S
proteasome peptidases, a mechanism distinct to the FDA
approved proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, and that the
inhibition of proteasome-associated DUBs is required for
Aur-mediated cytotoxicity, unveiling a new fundamental
mechanism for the anti-cancer effects of Aur.

RESULTS
Aur induces apoptosis in HepG2 and MCF-7 cells
To investigate the effect of Aur on the growth of
human cancer cells, cultured HepG2 and MCF-7 cells
were treated with Aur at various concentrations for 24 or
48 h and cell viability was measured with the MTS assay.
As shown in Fig. 1A, Aur decreased the cell viability in a
dose-dependent manner with the IC50 values of 0.43 (24 h)
and 0.17 μM (48 h) in HepG2 cells and 1.5 (24 h) and 0.41
μM (48 h) in MCF-7 cells, respectively.
We next analyzed the capacity of Aur to induce cell
death in these two cell lines. HepG2 and MCF-7 cells
were exposed to Aur for either 12 or 24 h, followed by
recording the Annexin V/PI (propidium iodide)-positive
cells with fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. A
dose-dependent cell death was observed (Figs. 1B and
1C). Consistently, the levels of the precursor forms of

inhibitor p21 and c-Jun proteins (Fig. 2B). In addition, Aur
also accumulated a surrogate proteasome substrate (GFPu)
and Ub-prs in a stable GFPu-HEK293 cell line (Figs. 2C
and 2D). Aur at 2.0 µM and bortezomib (Vel) at 50 nM
showed the similar level of GFPu accumulation (Fig. 2D).
We further compared the efficacy of proteasome inhibition
by Aur to that of Vel. We found that Ub-prs accumulation
induced by therapeutic dose of Aur (0.5 µM) was similar
to Vel at doses between 20 and 40 nM in K562 cells (Fig.
2E). These results indicate that the UPS inhibition by Vel
can be achieved by a therapeutic dose of Aur.

Aur inhibits the proteasome
We and others have reported that gold (III)containing compounds, like other metal (Cu, Zn)
compounds, could directly inhibit 20S proteasome
peptidase activities, but gold (I) compound was less
effective [24-26]. We first determined the effect of Aur
on endogenous proteasome substrate proteins in human
HepG2 and MCF-7 cancer cells to assess its effect on the
UPS. We found that Aur induced marked increases in total,
K48- and K63-linked ubiquitinated proteins (Ub-prs, Fig.
2A) and in the protein levels of cyclin-dependent kinase

were exposed to Aur (0.5, 1.0, 2.0 μM) for 3 h and 6 h. Ub-prs were detected using antibodies against all Ub, K48-linked, or K63-linked
polyubiquitin. GAPDH was used as a loading control. The western blot images were representatives from at least three independent
experiments. (B) Accumulation of endogenous proteasome substrates. p21 and c-Jun proteins were detected after treatment with Aur (0.5,

GFPu and Ub-prs were detected by western blot (C). Fluorescent GFPu images in the GFPu-HEK293 cells treated with Aur (2.0 µM) or Vel
(50 nM) were shown in (D). (E) Comparison of the accumulation of K48-linked Ub-prs induced by Aur and Vel. K562 cells were treated

in live HepG2 and MCF-7 cells by using the Promega
peptidase assay kit. We found that Aur at a dose as high as
10 µM did not inhibit the activities of the 26S proteasome
peptidases including chymotrypsin-like (CT-like), trypsinlike and caspase-like (Fig. S1A); unlike Vel, all the three
proteolytic peptidases including CT-like, caspase-like
and trypsin-like were not significantly affected by Aur
treatment in live cells under used conditions (Fig. S1B
and S1C). Next we tested its effect on proteasome DUB
activities.
We first performed a computational study to predict
the docking between Aur and the 19S-associated DUBs.
It was found that compound L2 (an active metabolite of
Aur, Fig. 3A, right) but not chloro triethylphosphine gold
L1 (Fig. 3A, left), could bind to the active site of UCHL5
with relatively high CDOCKER Energy of -14.51 kcal/
mol. The binding model (Fig. 3A, lower) shows that the
side chains of His164, Phe165 and Asp179 can coordinate
to Au+ with distances of 3.181 Å, 2.537 Å and 2.776Å,
respectively. Moreover, two ethyl groups stretch towards
hydrophobic side chains of Phe79 and Leu179. When
compound L2 was docked to the active site of USP14,
there were three ligand-poses produced (data not shown),
suggesting that compound L2 could also inhibit USP14
activity but relatively less than UCHL5. The following
experiments were performed to test this computational
model.
First, total cytoplasmic DUB activities were
detected by using Ub-AMC (ubiquitin 7-amido-4methylcoumarin), a fluorogenic substrate for a wide range
of DUBs, including UCHs and USPs. As shown in Fig.
3B, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), an inhibitor of UCH and
USP DUBs, completely inhibited, while Aur only slightly
inhibited, the total cytoplasmic DUB activities. Secondly,
we examined the effect of Aur on proteasome-associated
DUBs by using Ub-AMC as a DUB substrate and purified
26S proteasomes as DUB donor. As shown in Fig. 3C, Aur
(0.5, 1.0, 2.0 µM) inhibited proteasome DUB activity in
a dose-dependent manner; Aur at a dose of 2.0 µM and
NEM almost completely inhibited the 26S proteasomeassociated DUB activities. Additionally, we used N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a thiol-containing compound to block
the active site of Aur, and then tested its effect on DUB
inhibition. Under physiological conditions, NAC could
quickly bind with the Au+ atom of Aur forming a new
compound AcS-Au (CH3)3 as detected by HPLC assay
(Fig S2) and reported previously [38]. NAC recovered
most Aur-mediated DUB inhibition (Fig. 3D). These
results confirm the computational model that Aur targets
both UCHL5 and USP14 of the 26S proteasome. The
cleavage of tetraubiquitin chains (Ub4) mediated by
26S proteasome DUBs and a DUB active site-directed
labelling assay were also performed to further confirm this
effect. K48-linked Ub chains were cleaved in the presence
of 26S proteasomes and this was partially blocked by
Aur in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3E). To further
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

decipher which proteasome-associated DUB is inhibited
by Aur, we performed the active DUB labelling assay
using HA-tagged ubiquitin-Vinyl Sulfone (HA-UbVS), a
probe that can covalently bind to the active sites of the
cysteine protease families of DUBs [17]. We found that
the remaining active forms of both UCHL5 and USP14
(i.e., those can be covalently bound by HA-UbVS) were
clearly reduced in the 26S proteasomes pre-treated with
Aur at 2 µM and became completely undetectable in those
pre-treated with 40 µM Aur (Fig. 3F), indicating that Aur
inhibits both UCHL5 and USP14. Lastly, we employed
the gene knockdown approach to disassemble 19S RP
to test the necessity of 19S RP-associated DUBs as the
target of Aur proteasome inhibition. It has been reported
that RPN11 knockdown could disassemble the 19S RP of
the 26S proteasome [39], which has also been confirmed
in our study (data not shown) by glycerol gradient
ultracentrifugation. In the current study, HepG2 or GFPuHEK293 cells were transfected with RPN11-specific
siRNA for 48 h and the effects of Aur on Ub-prs or GFPu
accumulation were detected, respectively. As shown in Fig.
3G (left), RPN11 protein was effectively down-regulated
with transfection of RPN11 siRNA. RPN11 knockdown
itself highly induced Ub-prs accumulation which could
not be further increased by Aur in HepG2 cancer cells
(Fig. 3G, right). Similarly, Aur could not further increase
GFPu accumulation mediated by RPN11 silencing in
GFPu-HEK293 cells (Fig. 3H), further confirming that
Aur inhibits the 26S proteasome via targeting UCHL5
and USP14.

Proteasome inhibition is required for Aur-induced
cytotoxicity
In these experiments, we first analysed the dynamic
changes of proteasome inhibition and apoptosis induced
by Aur. HepG2 and MCF-7 cells were treated with 0.5 µM
Aur and then Ub-prs, caspases and PARP cleavage were
detected at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 h time points. We found
that Ub-prs accumulation (by proteasome inhibition)
was induced at the early time point, followed by caspase
activation and PARP cleavage (Fig. 4A), indicating
apoptosis occurs after proteasome inhibition. Next, we
used NAC (N-acetyl-cysteine) to block the active site of
Aur and then tested the effect on Aur-induced proteasome
inhibition and cell death. Similar to the rescuing effect
of NAC on Aur-mediated DUB inhibition, NAC, by
changing the chemical structure of Aur, completely
reversed Aur-induced Ub-prs accumulation (Fig. 4B);
and as expected, caspase activation and PARP cleavage
(indicators of apoptosis) were accordingly abolished in
HepG2 and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4C). The effect on apoptosis
was also confirmed using Annexin V/propidium (PI)
staining followed by flow cytometry (Fig. 4D) or inverted
fluorescent microscopy (Fig. 4E). Aur could also increase

disassembled by the 26S proteasomes after treatment with Aur (2.0, 40 μM). (F) Active-site–directed labeling of proteasomal DUBs.
Purified 26S proteasomes were treated with Aur (2.0, 40 μM) for 10 min and then labeled with HA-UbVS and fractionated via SDSPAGE. The covalently bound HA-UbVS was detected by western blot for the HA tag. (G) The effect of 26S proteasome disassembly by

ROS (reactive oxygen species) production which could be
blocked by NAC (Fig. S3) as previously reported [40]. To
differentiate the effects of Aur-mediated DUB inhibition
and ROS generation on cell apoptosis, we used a phenolcontaining antioxidant, Tertiary butylhydroquinone
(Tbhq), to compare the effects of Aur with NAC since,
theoretically, Tbhq could not bind with the active atom
site of Aur. As found, Tbhq (at 20 µM) could completely
scavenge Aur-medaited ROS generation (Fig. 5A) but

could not block Aur-mediated proteasome inhibition
and PARP cleavage (apoptosis indicator) in HepG2 cells
(Fig. 5B). Similar to 20 µM, relatively low doses of Tbhq
could not block Aur-induced proteasome inhibition and
cytotoxicity (Fig. 5C). In MCF-7 cells, 5 µM Tbhq could
significantly decrease Aur-mediated ROS generation
(Fig. 5D) but could not block Aur-mediated proteasome
inhibition and cytotoxicity either (Fig. 5E-5G). These
results further demonstrate that inhibition of DUB but not

inhibiting the translocation of NF-κB from the cytoplasm
to the nucleus (Fig. 6B). Mitochondrial membrane
potential was also diminished in a dose-dependent manner
by Aur treatment (Fig. 6C). These changes are consistent
with the effects of proteasome inhibition observed in most
previous reports [41]. Finally, we confirmed that Aurinduced cell death but not Ub-prs accumulation could be
completely rescued by z-VAD, a pan-caspase inhibitor,
as detected by PARP cleavage (Fig. 6D) and Annexin V/

size curve and tumor growth curve were significantly
different between Aur-treated- and vehicle-treated group
in these models (Figs. 7A and 7B) and the weights of
tumors were significantly reduced in Aur treatment group
compared to the control (Figs. 7A and 7B) while body
weight remained relatively stable in each group (Fig. 7C).
The immunostaining results showed that the representative
proteasome substrates including Ub-prs, p21, and c-Jun
proteins were all significantly increased (Fig. 7D) in the
Aur-treated tumors. Similar to the effect of Aur on cell
lysate DUB activity, Aur did not significantly affect
the total DUB activities in the tumor tissues (data not
shown). These results are consistent with the effects of
Aur observed in HepG2 and MCF-7 cells. Together, the
results show that Aur selectively inhibits tumor growth
and proteasome function in vivo.

significant apoptosis in the monocytes from AML patients
as detected with Annexin V/PI staining followed by flow
cytometry (Figs. 8B) or by fluorescence microscopy (Fig.

cell death in monocytes from healthy volunteers (Fig.

of Ub-prs in both cancer cells from AML patients and
mononuclear cells from normal controls (Fig. 8E). These
results demonstrate the ex vitro inhibitory effect of Aur on
proteasome function and selective killing on AML cancer
cells.

Prs in cultured cells. It is known that Aur could induce
intracellular ROS generation and inhibit thioredoxin
reductase activity [30, 35], but H2O2 at a dose as high
as 100 µM could not induce dramatic Ub-prs and GFPu
accumulation like Aur (data not shown), implying that
Aur-mediated proteasome inhibition is not associated
with ROS generation. A most recent report found that
ROS could directly inhibit only a small subsets of the
cysteine-containing DUBs (like UCHL1, USP2) via thiol
oxidation but not the metalloprotease like AMSH [44],
further supporting that ROS could not exert an important
contribution to Aur-induced DUB inhibition. However,
whether Aur targets RPN11 remains unclear. Since there
is no commercially available RPN11-specific substrate
for its activity assay, the effect of Aur on RPN11 DUB
activity could not be directly detected. Even though
RPN11 knockdown could mostly blocked Aur-mediated
DUB inhibition and protein degradation inhibition (Fig.
3G and 3H), 26S proteasome disassembly mediated by
RPN11 knockdown is possibly the major reason. Based
on the Ub chain cleavage data, 2 µM Aur could only
partially inhibit the Ub chain cleavage, not as potent as
in the cells. This is likely because the Ub chain cleavage
relies on the existence of both UCHL5/USP14 and RPN11
in this in vitro assay since 26S proteasome consists of
three DUBs and RPN11 could also cleave UB chain in
vitro as reported previously [17]. We also found that high
dose of Aur (40 µM) could completely block UbVS’s
binding with UCHL5 and USP14 but Aur at this dose
could not completely stop proteasome-mediated Ub chain
cleavage, indicating that RPN11 might not be a target of
Aur, which however needs to be further investigated in the
future. In this study, Aur induced the accumulation of both
K48- and K63-liked polyubiquitinated proteins in vitro
and in vivo. It is generally believed that cellular proteins
conjugated to K48-linked Ub chains are targeted to the
proteasome for degradation, while proteins conjugated
to K63-linked Ub chains may be directed to lysosomes
[45, 46]. To clarify this issue, a recent report shows that
purified 26S proteasomes bind and degrade K48- and K63ubiquitinated substrates similarly but in mammalian cells,
soluble factors, such as ESCRT0, selectively bind to K63
chains, thereby inhibiting or preventing the association of
K63 chains with the proteasome [47]. However, this was
recently challenged by another report [48], suggesting
that the regulation of K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin
remains elusive. It has been reported that Aur could inhibit
lysosome protease cathepsin B, but the effective dose is
much higher than the dose used in the present study [36].
This suggests that the accumulation of K63-linked poly
ubiquitinated proteins by Aur is unlikely due to lysosome
inhibition. Accumulation of K48-linked polyubiquitinated
proteins is also an important indicator of 20S proteasome
inhibition but this has been excluded by the inability
of Aur to inhibit the 20S proteasome (Fig. S1). Taken
together, these results indicate that Aur-mediated DUB

DISCUSSION
DUBs especially proteasomal DUBs are emerging
as attractive drug targets for cancer therapies. Although
inhibitors of proteasomal DUBs were recently reported
and shown experimentally to exhibit anticancer effects
[42], their suitability for clinical use remains unknown.
In the present study, we have discovered a novel property
of Aur, which is that it inhibits proteasomal protein
degradation by targeting primarily proteasomal DUBs.
Moreover, we have further demonstrated that the anticancer effect of Aur depends on its DUB-inhibiting
property. Hence, this study unveils the first DUB inhibitor
that is already in clinical use to treat human disease.
The current study demonstrates that Aur inhibits
the proteasome. This was confirmed by detecting both
endogenous and exogenous proteasome substrate
accumulation in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo, and this has
also been verified by 19S RP disassembly. Proteasome
inhibition induced by therapeutic doses of Aur is
comparable to Vel by observing both Ub-prs and GFPu
accumulation, like in some of the AML cells, therapeutic
doses of Aur even more strongly inhibited proteasome
inhibition than Vel. Aur inhibits the proteasome function,
with mechanisms distinct to FDA approved proteasome
inhibitor Vel. Unlike 20S proteasome inhibitors such as
Vel, Aur did not inhibit the activities of chymotrypsin-like,
trypsin-like and caspase-like activities of 20S proteasomes
under the used experimental conditions.
We here show that Aur mainly targets proteasomeassociated UCHL5 and USP14. Aur only slightly inhibits
total cytoplasmic DUB activities but almost completely
inhibits 26S proteasome UCHL5 and USP14 activities,
similar to the effect of b-AP15, a confirmed UCHL5 and
USP14 DUB inhibitor [17]. This is also confirmed by both
K48-linked polyubiquitin disassembly, DUB active sitedirected labeling assay, and 19S proteasome disassembly.
It has been reported that caspase activation could inhibit
proteasome function via cleaving 19S proteasome subunits
[43]. In this study, we confirmed that Aur-mediated DUB
inhibition is independent of caspase activation because
pan-caspase inhibition prevented Aur from inducing
apoptosis but did not stop Aur from accumulating Ubwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibition induces accumulation of both K48- and K63linked polyubiquitin in vitro and in vivo, with distinct
effects to 20S proteasome inhibitors [49, 50].
Aur-induced proteasome inhibition is required
for its cytotoxicity. It is well known that proteasome
inhibition induces apoptosis. In Aur-treated cells,
proteasome inhibition precedes apoptosis (Fig. 4a).
Several laboratories have reported that the metabolic
pathway of Aur most likely involves Au-S bond cleavage
and thiol-containing compounds like GSH could replace
glucopyranose and directly bind with Au atom to form
a GS-Au-P-(CH3)3 compound [38]. This has also been
verified in our study. Binding the active site of Aur with
NAC not only prevents Aur from inhibiting DUB and the
proteasome but also blocks Aur induction of apoptosis.
Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how
proteasome-inhibition induces cell death. The induction
of ER stress, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential,
and suppression of NF-κB nuclear translocation by
Aur are all consistent with a proteasome inhibition
scenario, further supporting the notion that Aur induces
cytotoxicity through inhibiting the proteasome. In spite
of the numerous studies that appeared in the literature,
the biological mechanisms of action of auranofin are
still controversial. The most important mechanisms of
the previous studies support that Aur targets thioredoxin
reductase, thus inducing the generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and cell apoptosis [33-35]. Nevertheless
some previous studies did not support this notion. Only
Au (III) but not Aur could induce ROS generation [51];
The knockdown of thioredoxin reductase-1 (TrxR1), the
well-known target of Aur, was not sufficient to oxidize
thioredoxin-1 (Trx1), suggesting that Trx1-independent
pathways should be considered when evaluating
pharmacological and toxicological mechanisms involving
TrxR1 inhibition [52]. In this current study, we did find
that Aur could induce ROS generation in these cell lines
but we confirm that ROS do not play important role in Aurinduced proteasome inhibition and cell apoptosis. This
has been confirmed by (i) thepapeutic doses of Aur could
dose-dependently inhibit proteasome DUB inhibition
and apoptosis, which could be completely reversed by
a classical ROS inhibitor NAC both in vitro and in situ.
Two possibilities exist regarding the effect of NAC.
On one hand, NAC scavenges ROS, on the other hand,
thiol-containing antioxidant NAC blocks Aur’s effect by
binding with the active site of Aur. (ii) To differentiate the
effects of ROS generation and DUB inhibition mediated
by Aur, we used a phenol-containing antioxidant, Tbhq,
to compare the effects of Aur with NAC since Tbhq
theoretically could not bind with the active gold site of
Aur. These two kinds of antioxidants could efficiently
scavenge ROS. But these two different antioxidants have
completely different effects on Aur-mediated proteasome
inhibition and cell apoptosis. Thiol-containing antioxidant
NAC could rescue Aur-mediated proteasome inhibition
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and cell apoptosis, while phenol-containing antioxidant
Tbhq could scavenge ROS but could not rescue or even
enhanced Aur-mediated proteasome inhibition and cell
death. Tbhq itself did not dramatically affect cell viability.
It is interesting to find that the combination of Tbhq and
Aur showed enhanced proteasome inhibition and cell
apoptosis, warranting further investigation in the future.
These results further confirm that Aur-mediated apoptosis
is associated with proteasome inhibition rather than ROS
generation.
Cancer cells are more sensitive to proteasome
inhibition. Here we also show that Aur inhibited tumor
growth in human xenografts in vivo with minimal
discernible toxicity, and Aur selectively induced
cytotoxicity in primary cancer cells from AML patients.
Aur treatment led to Ub-prs accumulation in normal
mononuclear cells similarly to the cancer cells but the
treatment induced much less cell death in the normal
cells than in cancer cells. Previous reports that ATP
bidirectionally regulates UPS is a possible explanation for
this effect [53, 54].
Although several DUB inhibitors have been
reported recently [17, 55, 56], a clinical DUB inhibitor
has not been reported. During the screening for novel
proteasome inhibitors, we discover that gold (I) compound
Aur targets proteasome-specific DUBs and selectively
induces cytotoxicity to cancer cells, while other metalcontaining compounds such as copper complexes inhibit
not only proteasome-associated DUBs but also nonproteasomal DUBs and 20S proteasome peptidases, thus
inducing cytotoxicity to cancer cells not as selectively as
Aur [57]. Hence, this study offers additional support to
Gold (I) -containing compound Aur as a promising cancer
drug candidate in cancer therapy. More importantly, this
study provides new insight into the understanding on the
relationship between metal-containing compounds and
the UPS by demonstrating the DUB inhibition property
of Aur and the necessity of the DUB inhibition in Aurinduced cytotoxicity and anti-tumor effects. To our best
knowledge, Aur represents the first proteasome-specific
DUB inhibitor that is in clinical use.
Studies into the molecular mechanisms of cancer
have revealed that, with a few exceptions, the disease lacks
a specific drug target. Therefore, new anticancer drugs not
only take many years and much money to develop but
also might not outperform existing drugs. Based on this
paradigm, Blagosklonny has proposed a business model:
to develop existing drugs for a novel use-the protection of
normal cells. The drug discovery can be complemented
by novel use of existing agents and even ‘failed’ drugs
[58]. Certain drugs used for hypertension, atherosclerosis,
diabetes, inflammation and immunosupression can protect
against cancer. These drugs include rapamycin and other
rapalogs, metformin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-blockers
and aspirin [59, 60, 61, 62]. Aur has been used clinically
to treat rheumatic arthritis for many years and it has also

Peptidase activity assay
About 4,000 cells were treated with Aur at various
concentrations at 37°C for 6 h. The drug-treated cells were
then incubated with the Glo Cell-Based Assay Reagent
(Promega Bioscience, Madison, WI) for 10 minutes.
Luminescence generated from each reaction was detected
with microplate reader (Varioskan Flash 3001, Thermo,
USA). In vitro proteasome peptidases were detected as
previously reported [64]. Briefly, These were performed
as we previously described. A 20 µL of Tris-HCl buffer
(pH 7.4) containing purified 26S proteasome (0.5 nM)
were added to a total volume of 180 µL Tris-HCl (pH
7.4) reaction buffer containing the synthetic fluorogenic
peptides (Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA). The reaction
mixture was then incubated at 37°C for 90 min and
analyzed for the fluorescence intensity of the free AMC
using a luminescence microplate reader (Varioskan Flash
3001, Thermo, USA).

Deubiquitinase activity assay
This was performed as reported [17]. Briefly, cell
lysate (5 μg) or 26S proteasomes (25 nM) was solved in
ice-cold DUB buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
7.5), 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM PMSF
and pretreated with Aur (2 µM) or 2 mM NEM for 15
minutes, then incubated with Ub-AMC substrate in a
100 μL reaction volume at 25°C. AMC release generated
from the cleaved substrate was temporally recorded with
microplate reader (Varioskan Flash 3001, Thermo, USA).

Computational modeling
In order to understand the intermolecular
interaction between Chloro (triethylphosphine) gold and
deubiquitinase RPN11, a molecular docking study was
performed with CDOCKER protocol of Discovery Studio
2.0 [65]. Taking into account the possible hydrolysis of
5466

the compound Chloro (triethylphosphine) gold (L1),
two compounds Chloro (triethylphosphine) gold (L1)
and (triethylphosphine) gold cation (L2) were selected
as the docking ligands. The geometry structures of two
compounds (L1 and L2) were respectively optimized
using the density functional theory (DFT) calculations
at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ level. The NPA charges were
obtained by the natural orbital population analysis (NPA).
These quantum chemistry calculations were performed
by using the Gaussian 03 package of programs [66].
The conformations with the lowest energy were selected
as initial docking ligand structures. During the whole
docking process, the proteins UCHL5 (PDB ID: 3RIS)
and USP14 (PDB ID: 2AYO) were rigid, while ligands
L1 and L2 were flexible. The Ludi Energy Estimate was
used for scoring the docked poses. The ligand-pose which
corresponded to the highest Ludi score was selected as the
most probable binding conformation [67]. All parameters
used in calculation were default except for explained.
As previous literatures [68, 69] show that the catalytic
triad in the active site of UCHL5 is formed by Cys88,
His164 and Asp179, while that of USP14 is formed by
Cys113, His434 and Asp450, the Input Site Spheres were
respectively centered on the two catalytic triads with

to each well containing cells and medium. Medium was
changed after 6 h, and the cells were incubated at 37°C
in a CO2 incubator for 24 h or 48 h, followed by Aur
treatment as indicated. Cells were collected for Western
blot assay as described above.

Cell death assay
Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry
using Annexin V-fluoroisothiocyanate (FITC) /PI double
staining [64]. Cells were treated, then collected and
washed with binding buffer, then incubated in working
solution (100 μl binding buffer with 1.0 μl Annexin
V-FITC) for 15 min in dark. PI was added just before
flow cytometric analysis. The double stained cells were
also imaged with an inverted fluorescence microscope
equipped with a digital camera (Axio Obsever Z1, Zeiss,
Germany).

Cell viability assay
MTS assay (CellTiter 96Aqueous One Solution
reagent; Promega, Shanghai, China) was used to test cell
viability according to previously reported [64]. Briefly,
2×105/ml cells in 100 μl were treated with Aur for 24 or
48 h. 4 h before culture termination, 20 μl MTS was added
to the wells. The absorbance density was read on a 96well plate reader at wavelength 490 nm. IC50 values were
calculated.

Ubiquitin chain disassembly
In vitro disassembly of purified tetra-ubiquitin
chains (K48- or K63- linked) was performed as described
earlier [17]. 26S proteasomes (25 nM) were pre-incubated
with Aur (2, 40 μM) for 10 min in vitro. Then K48- or
K63-linked Ub chains (1 μg) were added into the DUB
buffer for 1 h at 37°C. The extent of chain disassembly
was assessed by western blot analysis.

The mitochondrial membrane potential of Aurtreated and untreated cells was assayed by using
rhodamine-123 staining as we previously reported [72].
Cells were treated with Aur for 12 h and stained with 1 μM
of rhodamine-123 for 1 h at 37°C. Following the staining,
the cells were washed with PBS twice, and then harvested
for flow cytometry analysis.

Active DUB labeling assays
This was performed as previously reported [70, 71].
26S proteasomes (25 nM) were treated with Aur (2, 40
μM) for 10 minutes before they were incubated with HAUbVS for 1 h at 37°C, followed by boiling in reducing
sample buffer and resolving by SDS-PAGE. After protein
transfer to PVDF membranes, HA immunoblotting was
used to detect HA-UbVS labeled DUBs.

In vitro complex formation of Aur with NAC and
HPLC analysis.
A 1 mM solution of Aur was mixed with a 10

48 h in room temperature. Incubation mixtures were
collected and then ﬁltered through a 0.45μm Advantec
ﬁlter and a 20 µl volume was injected into the HPLC
system. Chromatographic analysis was performed with

consisted of a mixture of acetonitrile-0.1% phosphoric
acid (60:40 v/v %), and the column temperature was

and six volunteers were recruited in this preclinical
study. Mononuclear cells were isolated by FicollPaque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient.
Mononuclear cell fraction was cultured in RPMI 1640
culture medium with 15% FBS.

Nude mouse xenograft model

ROS production was detected as previously reported
[73]. HepG2 and MCF-7 cells were treated with Aur
(0.5 μM) and /or NAC (5 mM) for 12 h. The cells were
harvested and incubated with the free serum medium with
addition of 10 μM of DCFH-DA for 20 min at 37°C in
the dark. In the presence of ROS, DCFH penetrates the
cells and is in turn oxidized to DCF. DCF fluorescence
was detected by flow cytometry.

ROS measurement

Nude Balb/c mice were bred at the animal facility
of Guangzhou Medical University. The mice were housed
in barrier facilities with a 12 h light dark cycle, with food
and water available ad libitum. 3×107 of HepG2 or MCF7 cells was inoculated subcutaneously on the flanks of
5-week-old male nude mice. After 72 h of inoculation,
mice were treated with either vehicle (10% DMSO, 30%
Cremophor ELand 60% NaCl) or Aur (6 mg/kg/day) for
totally 15 or 21 days, respectively. Tumors were measured
every other day with use of calipers. Tumor volumes were
calculated as previously reported [66]. Aur was dissolved
in the buffer with 10% DMSO, 30% Cremophor EL
and 60% NaCl. All animal studies were conducted with
the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Guangzhou medical University.

Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed at least thrice, and
the results were expressed as Mean±SD where applicable.
GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad Software) was
used for statistical analysis. Comparison of multiple
groups was made with one-way ANOVA followed by
Tukey’s test or Newman-Kueuls test. P value of <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

primary antibodies were against ubiquitin, K-48- or K63linked polyubiquitin, p21 and c-Jun. 50 μl MaxVisionTM
reagent was applied to each slide. Color was developed
with 0.05% diaminobenzidine and 0.03% H2O2 in 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and the slides were counterstained with
hematoxylin. A negative control for every antibody was
also included for each xenograft specimen by substituting
the primary antibody with preimmune rabbit serum.
