ABSTRACT
Triple negative, resistant or metastatic disease are major factors in breast
cancer mortality, warranting novel approaches. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is
implicated in survival, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and inhibition
provides an innovative therapeutic strategy. The efficacy of 5 novel ureidosubstituted sulfamate CAIX inhibitors were assessed in increasingly complex
breast cancer models, including cell lines in normoxia and hypoxia, 3D spheroids
and an ex-vivo explant model utilizing fresh biopsy tissue from different breast
cancer subtypes. CAIX expression was evaluated in a tissue microarray (TMA)
of 92 paired lymph node and primary breast cancers and 2 inhibitors were
appraised in vivo using MDA-MB-231 xenografts. FC11409B, FC9398A, FC9403,
FC9396A and S4 decreased cell proliferation and migration and inhibited 3D
spheroid invasion. S4, FC9398A and FC9403A inhibited or prevented invasion into
collagen. FC9403A significantly reversed  established invasion whilst FC9398A
and DTP348 reduced xenograft growth. TMA analysis showed increased CAIX
expression in triple negative cancers. These data establish CAIX inhibition as a
relevant therapeutic goal in breast cancer, targeting the migratory, invasive, and
metastatic potential of this disease. The use of biopsy tissue suggests efficacy
against breast cancer subtypes, and should provide a useful tool in drug testing
against invasive cancers.

INTRODUCTION

metastasis. Metastatic growth is associated with epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is strongly linked
to loss of E-cadherin [21] because hypoxia activates the
lysyl oxidase-Snail pathway which represses E-cadherin
expression [22]. Furthermore, CAIX is known to impede
E-cadherin mediated cell adhesion by decreasing the amount
of E-cadherin bound to the cytoskeleton [14]. Recent
studies also demonstrate that CAIX enhances the metastatic
potential of tumor cells by a mechanism associated with
decreased Rho-GTPase activity leading to EMT [23].
We and others have been involved in the
development of novel, more specific CAIX inhibitors as
a potential, innovative therapeutic strategy for treatment
of breast cancer and other solid tumors [24–27].
However, targeting survival mechanisms involved in
adaptation to the tumor microenvironment in oncology
drug development requires culture techniques that
reproduce these acidic/hypoxic conditions, and therefore
more appropriate systems are needed to develop these
approaches. We utilized a range of pre-clinical models
to assess the effects of these compounds, from cell
lines cultured in normoxic or hypoxic conditions to 3D
spheroid culture and xenografts. This approach was
extended by examining the effects of these compounds
on the survival and invasion of ex vivo cultures of tumor
explants from fresh, pre-treatment, breast cancer patient
biopsies, which more accurately reflect receptor and
oncogene overexpression and contain stromal elements
that may affect therapeutic outcomes. This model system
encompasses the heterogeneity found in breast tumors
per se, as well as that found between different breast
cancer subtypes.
Our data using these varied in vitro and in vivo
experimental systems show that CAIX inhibition has a
significant effect on migration, invasion and proliferation
in the common breast cancer subtypes and that CAIX
expression significantly correlates with metastasis in a
series of lymph node positive patient breast tumors. This
suggests that CAIX inhibitors are likely to form a useful
therapeutic adjunct to conventional adjuvant radiotherapy
and systemic therapy for breast cancer.

A recent analysis by over 100 breast cancer
specialists emphasized critical gaps in research knowledge
needed to increase the successful treatment of breast
cancer. Targeting the tumour microenvironment, novel
therapies for metastatic and triple negative breast cancer
and better experimental models that encompass breast
cancer subtypes were amongst the factors highlighted [1].
To address several of these issues, we examined the effect
of novel inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX),
an enzyme involved in pH regulation, on breast cancer
growth and invasion using a series of increasingly
complex models.
As solid tumors develop, areas of low oxygen
tension and acidosis are produced which are associated
with the development of radiation and chemotherapy
resistance [2]. Hypoxic conditions activate the
transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1
(HIF-1), a heterodimer containing HIF-1α and HIF-1β
subunits [3]. HIF-1α expression is mainly dependent on
hypoxia since, in the presence of oxygen, it is degraded
within minutes [4]. However, dysregulation of tumor
suppressors, oncogenes and growth factor receptor number
increase the expression of HIF-1α and up-regulation of
transcriptional targets in normoxic cancer cells [5, 6]. In
breast cancer, increased HIF-1α expression is associated
with poor prognosis, since HIF-1 controls expression
of proteins required for surviva1 in hypoxic and acidic
conditions [7, 8].
One such protein, CAIX, has been linked to poor
prognosis and survival of breast cancer patients [9–12].
Expression of CAIX is low in normal breast tissue or
benign lesions, but strongly expressed in 50% of all
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast, and in 38%
of DCIS associated with invasive disease and is present
mainly in abnormal epithelium in breast carcinoma [9, 13].
The CAIX transmembrane protein consists of a
proteoglycan-like domain and an intracellular carboxy
terminal tail which can influence cell-cell adhesion [14],
and catalyzes the reversible reaction CO2 + H2O → H+ +
HCO3− [15]. This production of protons acidifies the tumor
microenvironment, while bicarbonate ions are transported
into the cell maintaining an alkaline intracellular
pH [16, 17], which may inhibit apoptosis [2, 18].
Hypoxia increases expression of metalloproteinases
in breast and other cancer cells; these enzymes are activated
in acidic conditions causing destruction of basement
membrane components thus enhancing the ability of tumor
cells to metastasize [18, 19]. Similarly, cell migration
depends on acidic conditions in lamellipodia, which
are partially produced by activation of CAIX and its
interaction with bicarbonate transporters [20]. Since the
acidic/hypoxic conditions in the tumor microenvironment
facilitate tumor progression, CAIX plays an important part
in the acidification of the tumor environment and tumor

RESULTS
Novel ureido-sulfamate CAIX inhibitors reduce
cell proliferation in a panel of breast cancer cell
lines in normoxic and hypoxic conditions
Our previous study evaluating a series of 50
novel ureido-sulfamate CAIX inhibitors, showed that
5 compounds could significantly inhibit proliferation of
several human breast cancer cell lines in both hypoxic
(0.5% O2) and normoxic conditions (21% O2); these were
FC11409B, FC9398A, FC9403, FC9396A and S4 (24).
Their structures are shown in Figure 1A. Ki values for
these compounds against CAIX and details of synthesis

were previously reported [25]. We examined the effects
of these inhibitors in an expanded panel of breast cancer
cell lines (Supplementary Table S1) representing the major
breast cancer subtypes, with variable hormone and growth
factor receptor expression. The effect of all 5 compounds
on cell proliferation is illustrated using the MDA-MB-231
cell line as an example in Figure 1B (normoxia) and
Figure 1C (hypoxia). Similar data were obtained for all
cell lines examined. In normoxic conditions the inhibitory
effect of all 5 compounds on cell proliferation in this cell
line was highly significant (P < 0.001) at 30 and 100 μM
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

except for FC9396A which was significant at 100 μM
alone and for FC9403 which significantly inhibited
cell proliferation at 10 μM (Figure 1B). The variation
in response between some of the cell line panel in
normoxia is demonstrated in Figure 1D using FC9396A
as an example. The dose responses demonstrated that
the IC50 values for each compound varied between cell
lines in normoxic conditions (Supplementary Table S2).
However, in hypoxic conditions, the effect of all the
inhibitors was highly significant (P < 0.001) at 30 and 100
μM, with cell proliferation almost completely inhibited at

compounds in low oxygen tensions were similar in each
of the cell lines with IC50 values between 10 and 30 μM.

hypoxic cores of 3D spheroids [17], we clearly show
that in many of our breast cancer cell spheroid models,
that there is variant expression of CAIX in areas of
the spheroids that are not hypoxic (Supplementary
Figure S2C).

The effect of CAIX inhibitors on 3D breast
spheroid invasion

The effect of novel CAIX inhibitors on breast
cancer cell migration in hypoxia and normoxia

To examine the ability of the CAIX inhibitors to
impede invasion of 3D breast cancer cell cultures, MDAMB-231 spheroids were embedded in collagen plugs
containing the CAIX inhibitors at different concentrations
and examined at 24 and 48 h. A representative experiment
is shown in Figure 2A (A–H), and results for all
compounds are shown in Figure 2B. This data reveals
significant inhibition in the capacity of MDA-MB-231
spheroids to invade a collagen matrix if treated with S4
or FC9403A at 30 or 100 μM and FC11409B, FC9398A,
FC9396A at 100 μM. FC9396A (3 μM) however,
significantly increased invasion. Although both 2D and
3D migration/invasion assays showed some inhibitory
activity for all the active compounds, the results from
3D spheroid collagen invasion assays confirmed that S4
and FC9403A are the most active inhibitors of migration/
invasion.

The influence of the five CAIX inhibitors on
migration was assessed using wound healing assays with
the MDA-MB-231 invasive cell line. The results for S4
in normoxia (Supplementary Figure S1A) and hypoxia
(Supplementary Figure S1B) show concentrations of 30
μM clearly inhibit migration. Supplementary Table S3
illustrates that these novel CAIX inhibitors reduce the
migratory capacity of these cells under both normoxic
and hypoxic conditions, except for FC9396A, which was
only effective in normoxia. However, MDA-MB-231
cells migrated into the wound area as single cells,
making accurate quantitation difficult. Therefore the
same inhibitors were further assessed using the invasive
ovarian cell line SKOV3, to determine firstly, that the
effects on migration/invasion are not specific to the MDAMB-231 model alone and also to provide quantitative data
(Supplementary Figure S1C).
Significant inhibition of motility was observed
in SKOV-3 cells treated with S4 at 10, 30, and 100 μM
in normoxic conditions and at 30 and 100 μM in
hypoxic conditions. FC11409B inhibited migration
in both normoxia and hypoxia, but only at the highest
concentrations of 100 μM. FC9396A had little inhibitory
activity in this assay in normoxic or hypoxic conditions,
while FC9398A, was effective at 100 μM in normoxia,
and 30 and 100 μM in hypoxia. FC9403A was equally
effective regardless of oxygen status at both 30 and
100  μM. The combined results for this assay suggest
that the compounds S4 and FC9403A are the most active
inhibitors of migration.

The effect of CAIX inhibitors on growth and
invasion of tumor explants
To assess the effects of CAIX inhibition in actual
tumor tissue, ex vivo human breast tumor explants from
pre-treatment fresh core needle biopsies were examined.
A representative assay using FC9403A is shown in
Figure 3A (A–D), after 5 days of culture, and demonstrates
clear invasion in both the control (A) and 10 μM (B)
treated explants, while higher concentrations of 30 (C)
and 100 μM (D) prevented invasion. Figure 3B illustrates
pooled data from 26 separate biopsy specimens (explant
number = 214 – 177 per time point) after growth in
collagen for 15 days with invasion assessed by increased
area. Although approximately 50% of explants were
invasive by Day 5, the percentage increase in invasion
was significantly increased by Day 10. The effect of three
CAIX inhibitors, S4, FC9403A and FC9398A, on growth
and invasion were assessed.
The results for S4 (Figure 3C) show at day 5 there
is no significant growth under any treatment. However by
day 10 and 15 the higher concentrations of S4 (30 and
100 μM) have significantly prevented growth and invasion
of the tumor tissue. Similar results were obtained using the
compound FC9398A and FC9403A (Figure 3D and 3E).
Again, by day 15 concentrations of FC9403A from 3
to 100 μM significantly inhibited explant invasion into
collagen in comparison with untreated control explants.
Although some explants showed invasive capacity,
they also demonstrated regression in actual explant

CAIX expression in breast cancer cell 3D
spheroids
3D breast cancer spheroids, which contain a
graduated range of oxygen concentrations, were assessed
to determine the presence of hypoxic areas and CAIX
positive staining. The hypoxic core of an MDA-MB-231
spheroid is shown using ‘Hypoxyprobe’ visualized using
a fluorescent microscope (Supplementary Figure S2A).
Similarly, HIF-1α staining is also shown for comparison
in MDA-MD-231 spheroids (Supplementary Figure S2B).
Immunohistochemical staining for CAIX in several
breast cancer cell spheroid models showed that the
expression of this enzyme is not confined to hypoxic areas
(Supplementary Figure S2C). Although it has previously
been reported that CAIX expression is confined to the

size (Figure 4A). These would be considered noninvasive if explant area measurement was the sole criteria
used to determine the effects of the CAIX inhibitors
on invasion. Therefore, to ensure that invasion was
measured accurately, we recorded whether or not each
explant invaded collagen when treated with differing
concentrations of each of the inhibitors (Figure 4B–4E).
These results depict only whether an explant was scored as
invasive or non-invasive, regardless of area. Using these
criteria, all three drugs significantly inhibited invasion
at 30 and 100 μM, however, invasion was completely
prevented by FC9403A at these concentrations.

To determine whether these compounds could
also influence established invasive growth, inhibitors
were added after 15 days to invasive explants and the
consequences monitored. A representative experiment
using FC9403A is shown in Figure 5A. Results for
FC9398A (Figure 5B) indicate that, although invasion has
not been reversed, the inhibitor has prevented any further
growth in the invasive front since there is no significant
difference in invasive area after treatment with drug

for 5 or 10 days when compared to the Day 0 (start of
treatment) control. After 10 days treatment, there was
a significant inhibition of growth in comparison with
Day 10 control. Similarly, S4 did not reverse invasion
over this timeline, but after 5 days treatment, there was
no significant increase in growth in control or treated
invasive explants (Figure 5C). However by day 10 growth
of explants treated with 30 μM S4 was significantly
different from both day 0 and day 10 controls, suggesting
that although invasive growth was continuing, it was at
a reduced rate. Interestingly, data for FC9403A indicated
that growth was not only inhibited, but the invasive
process was significantly reversed as illustrated in
Figure 5A. Statistical analysis shows significant decreases
in the invasive area of these explants after 5 and 10 days
treatment with FC9403A (Figure 5D).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Because of the heterogeneous nature of the
human biopsy tissue within the studies shown in
Figure 5A–5D, and since separate biopsy material
had been used for each inhibitor, a further experiment
was performed using explant tissue from the same
biopsy and the inhibitors  compared using 30 μM of
each inhibitor within the same treatment schedule
(Figure 5E). This demonstrates that only explants
treated with FC9403A  showed a significant decrease
in invasive area in comparison with Day 0 controls
denoting a reversal of the invasive front, while both S4
and FC9308A have significantly prevented any further
invasive growth at both time-points when inhibitortreated explants are compared with Day 10 and 15
controls. These results are in accordance those shown
in Figure 5A–5D.

majority of invading cells in these explants were clearly
CAIX positive.
Treatment with S4 decreased the number of CAIXpositive cells, with staining greatly reduced in explants
treated with 100 μM S4 compared to controls (compare
Supplementary Figure S4G and S4H with Supplementary
Figure S4E and S4F). This suggests that CAIX inhibitors may
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

induce cell death in CAIX-positive cells, since S4 treatment
also increased levels of cleaved caspase 3 expression
in comparison to untreated control (Supplementary
Figure S5A–S5F). Tumor regression or stasis may be
generated via reduced proliferation. Controls revealed higher
expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 in comparison to
S4 treated explants, (Supplementary Figure S5G and S5H).

CAIX inhibitors slow tumor growth in vivo by
decreasing cell proliferation and increasing
cell death

In agreement with these results, an earlier study using
RNAi, to decrease CAIX expression, found significant
effects on growth and survival under both normoxic and
hypoxic conditions in breast cancer cells [33]. Because
oncogenic changes can stabilize HIF expression in
normoxic cancer cells, [5, 6], CAIX expression can be
increased in normoxic conditions in breast cancer cell
lines (Supplementary Figure S2). A previous report
has suggested that ureido-sulfamate inhibitors may
preferentially target active CAIX [34], which may explain
the more potent effect of these inhibitors in hypoxia, where
CAIX activity would increase as cells become more reliant
on glycolysis. Although others have described CAIX as
being present only in the hypoxic cores of 3D spheroids
[17], CAIX is clearly expressed independently of hypoxia
and is not confined to the hypoxic peri-necrotic areas of
breast cancer cell spheroids (Supplementary Figure S2).
This may explain the effectiveness of these compounds in
normoxic conditions in 2D assays, since some expression
is clearly independent of oxygen concentration.
Wound healing assays illustrated the potential of
4 of these novel compounds, S4, FC11409B, FC9398A
and FC9403A to effectively hinder migration of breast
and ovarian cancer cells in both normoxic and hypoxic
conditions (Supplementary Figure S1A–S1D). The
C-terminal intracellular tail of CAIX is regulated by
phosphorylation of Thr443 by PKA; this transmits
signals to the extracellular enzyme domain in hypoxic
conditions and influences cell migration [35, 36]. CAIX
also increases cell migration and invasion in vitro via
transcriptional activation and modulation of proteins
involved in cytoskeletal reorganisation and EMT [23].
It has been postulated that CAIX interacts with the
secreted protein DKK1 and interferes with the Rho/
ROCK signaling pathway causing activation of paxillin,
which promotes dynamic adhesion turnover and migration
[23]. Interestingly, this Rho/ROCK pathway is pH
sensitive [37, 38].
Spheroid invasion assays illustrated the potential of
these CAIX inhibitors to hinder invasion and further, at
higher concentrations, prevent it. Interestingly, the most
invasive spheroids are those formed from MDA-MD-231
cells and as shown in Supplementary Figure S2C, these
have extremely high CAIX expression. Using tumor
explants from treatment naïve breast cancer patients, we
confirmed that the inhibitors S4, FC9398A and FC9403A
could inhibit and prevent metastatic invasion of collagen
plugs using several methods of analysis (Figures 3 and 4).
In addition, all these compounds could prevent further
invasive growth of established explants and in the case
of FC9403A, could significantly reverse invasive growth
(Figure 5D and 5E). The majority of invasive cells from
the explants were positive for CAIX expression. Treatment
with inhibitory compounds increased the expression of
cleaved caspase-3, while concomitantly reducing the
expression of Ki67 and CAIX. Decreased expression

Pharmacokinetic data (unpublished data-personal
communication Erik Pettersen) indicated that FC9398A
and a novel nitroimidazole based sulfamide CAIX
inhibitor, DTP348 had better in vivo stability, with positive
results in HT-29 colorectal xenograft models [26, 27];
(DTP348 structure is shown in [27]). MDA-MD-231
xenografts were therefore used to examine the in vivo
effects of CAIX inhibition in breast cancer. Figure 6A
illustrates that both these compounds could reduce
relative tumor volume when used alone. Interestingly,
although these two compounds had similar effects on
tumor volume, only DTP348 significantly decreased Ki67
expression and reduced the percentage of viable cells
in the xenograft model (Figures 6B and 6C). Figure 6D
illustrates the extent and location of CAIX-positive cells
in an untreated MDA-MB-231 xenograft.

DISCUSSION
This study validates the pH regulator CAIX as a
strong therapeutic candidate with potential effectiveness
in treatment of breast cancer, including TNBC, and as far
as we are aware, is the first report to show the preclinical
efficacy of CAIX inhibition in human breast cancer tissue
from various breast cancer subtypes, thus potentially
helping to fill critical gaps in breast cancer treatment
as previously outlined [1]. The effectiveness of several,
novel, specific inhibitors was determined in a number of
biological assays using both 2D and 3D cell and tissue
models. We clearly demonstrate that these compounds
can significantly inhibit and prevent breast cancer cell
proliferation and invasion in a dose-dependent manner.
Furthermore, the compound, FC9403A, could significantly
reverse established invasion of ex-vivo collagen embedded
fresh breast cancer biopsy material. The mechanisms
involved in these effects depend on loss of proliferation
and increased apoptosis of CAIX-positive cells.
Presently, there is a compelling requirement for
better methods to control and treat metastatic disease,
particularly in breast, lung and testicular cancers, which
have greater metastatic potential than other malignancies
[1, 29, 30]. In a murine knock down model, CAIX
deficiency had no effect on growth, reproduction, health
or lifespan of mice in comparison with wild type controls,
and no morphologic or histologic effects other than gastric
hyperplasia in targeted mice were observed [31, 32]. This
suggests that inhibition of CAIX function should have
limited toxicity in normal tissue supporting its potential as
an anticancer therapy.
2D cultures demonstrated significant inhibition of
cell proliferation in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions.

of CAIX in treated explants implies that CAIX positive
cells have been selectively removed, suggesting that
apoptosis had been induced in cells expressing CAIX and
that proliferation decreased in treated explants. Because
FC9403A not only effectively inhibited tumor growth
and invasion, but also reversed established invasive
growth, the method involved in preventing invasion
is not dependent on inhibition of metalloproteinases;
supporting the involvement of apoptosis in removal of the
invading cells.
Analysis of CAIX in a series of breast cancer
patients with axillary node metastases showed that
higher CAIX expression correlated with HER2 positive
and triple negative breast cancer, which are prone to be
more aggressive and metastatic. Several studies support
a role for CAIX in breast cancer invasion and lymph
node metastasis [11, 12, 39]. For example, IL-6/Notch-3
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

signaling increases CAIX expression and stimulates
breast cancer cell invasion [40, 41] and HER2+ and
triple negative breast cancers which express CAIX are
associated with poor prognosis and high levels of early
metastases to bone, lung and brain [42].
In vivo xenograft work, additionally demonstrated
that these novel CAIX inhibitors can slow tumor growth
by a mechanism involving decreased proliferation and
loss of viability. This is supported by studies in a colon
cancer model, where overexpression of CAIX amplified
the growth rate of 3D spheroids and xenografts, but also
increased necrosis, apoptosis and proliferation [43].
Increased growth caused greater areas of hypoxia in the
core of the 3D structures, which would account for higher
levels of cell death. This study also demonstrated that
the area of viable tissue increased with CAIX expression
[43]. CAIX knockdown has been shown to increase tumor

regression, survival and relapse in a murine metastatic
breast cancer model. Furthermore this strategy virtually
eliminated metastatic growth [39]. The CAIX inhibitor
S4, has also shown anti-metastatic capabilities in a
murine model using the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell
line [25].
Our data supports the premise that CAIX plays an
essential role in the invasive and metastatic processes
involved in breast cancer progression using several model
systems. Importantly, this study shows in ex vivo assays
using live human breast cancer tissue, that CAIX is a
relevant therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.
As far as we are aware, this is the first report of this
type, using live cultured ex vivo breast cancer tissue
for a period of 25 days Recent work demonstrated that
tumor grafts from breast cancer patients cultured in mice,
accurately replicate tumor growth, metastatic potential
and pathology of the major breast cancer classifications
[44], and importantly, conserve the histological markers
and features of the original tumor such as HER2 and ER
positivity, as well as proliferation indices [45].
The explant ex vivo model reported herein, conserves
many aspects of the original tumor pathophysiology and
is therefore is more relevant for oncology drug trials,
particularly those involving microenvironmental targets
and further allows the influences of stromal elements
on drug responses to be assessed. It not only reflects the
heterogeneous nature of breast tumors per se, but also the
heterogeneous nature of the disease, since biopsies from
all major breast cancer subtypes were available for use in
this study, suggesting that these CAIX inhibitors could be
beneficial in all types of breast cancer.
Our results using these CAIX inhibitory compounds
are supported by other recent findings reporting decreases
in both primary tumor growth and metastasis in several
preclinical breast tumor models with no signs of nonspecific toxicity [25, 40, 46]. One CAIX inhibitor,
Indisulam, is currently in Phase II clinical trials treating
various tumor types, including stage IV melanoma, renal
clear cell carcinoma, lung, pancreatic and metastatic breast
cancer [47]. Our data clearly show that inhibition of CAIX
using these novel ureido-sulfamate compounds influences
both the proliferation/cell death and migration and
invasion of human breast cancer cells. CAIX is therefore
an attractive target for breast cancer treatment.

Hypoxystation H35 Workstation. MCF 10A cells were
cultured in DMEM/F12, supplemented with donor horse
serum (5%), epidermal growth factor (20 ng/ml)
hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), cholera toxin (100  ng/ml)
insulin (10 μg/ml) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All
cell lines were purchased from ATTC and tested and
authenticated using STR profiling by Public Health
England, Porton Down, Salisbury, UK, (November 2014).

Sulforhodamine B assay
Cells were plated (1 × 103/200 μl media) in 96well plates and treated after 48 hours. At appropriate
times, wells were fixed with 50 μl 25% trichloroacetic
acid, washed with H2O and dried before addition of SRB
(50 μl). After 30 minutes, plates were washed with 1%
acetic acid. When dry, 150 μl of SRB assay buffer (10 mM
Tris pH10.5), was added per well for 1 hour before reading
at 540 nm on a Biohit BP800 platereader.

Wounding/invasion assay
Cells (MDA-MB-231 or SKOV3 (5 × 105/well))
were grown in 6-well plates until confluent. After
wounding with a sterile tip, media containing 0.2% serum
and the drug of interest were added. Invasion/migration of
cells was calculated by comparison of the scratch at time
‘0′ and after 24 or 48 hours. The extent of migration of the
SKOV3 cells was determined by analyzing the percentage
of closed wound area, measured using DatInf Measure
setup Wizard software.

3D cell culture
Cells were incubated in spinner flasks and cultured
at 37°C in 5% CO2 until spheroids formed. Growth
of live cells in 3D culture was monitored by adding
a 10 μM solution of Cell Tracker Green CMFDA
(5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate) to a sample of
spheroids for 45 minutes at 37°C. After washing, fresh
media was applied for 30 minutes before checking growth
using a fluorescent microscope.

3D invasion studies using breast tumor spheroids
or human breast cancer biopsy explants
The collection of fresh breast tumor biopsy material
received local ethical approval from the Lothian Tissue
Governance Committee (10/S1402/33). Informed
consent from patients for the collection and use of
tissue samples was obtained prior to use. Breast tumor
biopsy material was trimmed and cut into 1mm3 pieces.
Collagen type I (Wako Chemicals) was mixed with 1:1000

the intraperitoneal route in saline on days 0–4. Tumor size
was measured twice weekly using calipers and the volume
calculated according to the formula π/6 × length × width2.
Relative tumor volumes (%) were calculated for each
individual tumor by dividing the tumor volume on day t
(Vt) by the tumor volume on day 0 (V0) and multiplying
by 100. Tumors were excised and dissected (50% snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen; 50% placed into formalin
saline for 24 hours) before embedding in paraffin. Ki67
expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Ten
fields per xenograft section were evaluated via Image J.

Immunohistochemistry

Statistical analysis

Embedded sections from spheroids or tumor
explants were dewaxed and antigen retrieval performed
before washing and blocking for 10 minutes. After
washing, slides were incubated with primary antibody for
1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C, before
washing. Slides were incubated with Dako Envision
labelled polymer for 30 minutes, washed and treated with
DAB substrate, before counterstaining with haematoxylin.

Data was analysed by ANOVA followed by TukeyKramer multiple comparison test; a P value of < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Other materials
Cell Tracker Green CMFDA (5-Chloromethyl
fluorescein Diacetate) was obtained from Invitrogen (UK).
HIF-1α antibody was obtained from BD Biosciences
(610958); CAIX and NHE1 from Novus Biologicals
(NB100-417, and NBP1-20198, respectively); CAIX
from Bioscience Slovakia (clone M75; Ki67 from Dako
(M7240); cleaved caspase-3 from Cell Signalling (9661);
Hypoxyprobe-1 Kit from Hypoxyprobe Inc. All antibodies
were validated by western blot to confirm the absence of
non-specific bands. The novel ureido-sulfamate CAIX
inhibitors FC11409B, FC9398A, FC9403, FC9396A and S4
were synthesized as previously detailed [24, 25]. DTP was
synthesized as previously described [26].

Tissue microarray (TMA)
Tissue samples originated from patients with
primary breast carcinomas treated in the Edinburgh
Breast Unit between 1999 and 2002. The study received
local ethical approval from the Lothian Research Ethics
Committee (08/S1101/41). No informed consent (written
or verbal) was obtained for use of retrospective tissue
samples from the patients within this study, most of
whom were deceased, as this was not deemed necessary
by the Ethics Committee. Axillary lymph node dissection
was performed on all patients as part of surgery for
large or high-grade invasive breast carcinomas and
extracted tissues embedded into a recipient paraffin
block in a uniformly spaced array pattern for further
analysis. TMAs were constructed in biological triplicate.
Ninety-two cancers were available for analysis after
TMA construction, immunostaining, AQUAsition, and
AQUAnalysis as detailed in previous work [48].
