BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to document the differences in testosterone (T) levels between crizotinib-treated and
noncrizotinib-treated patients with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Testosterone levels were measured in
19 men with metastatic NSCLC who received crizotinib and in 19 men with metastatic NSCLC who did not receive crizotinib. Clinical
characteristics of the patients were compared, and additional hormone assays were performed as appropriate. Two patients who
began crizotinib and 4 patients who had dose interruptions or who stopped crizotinib therapy had serial hormone measurements,
permitting the documentation of dynamic hormone changes on and off crizotinib treatment. RESULTS: Total T levels were low
(<241 ng/dL) in 19 of 19 (100%) crizotinib-treated men and in 6 of 19 men (32%) with metastatic NSCLC who did not receive crizotinib
(mean T levels, 131 ng/dL and 311 ng/dL, respectively; P ¼ .0002). Only 1 in 5 patients who had anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
gene rearrangements and had not yet received crizotinib had low T. The initiation of crizotinib in 2 patients who had previously
normal T levels was associated with a rapid decreases in T and in luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels within 14
to 21 days. Discontinuation of crizotinib led to increases back to normal T levels. CONCLUSIONS: Crizotinib therapy caused rapid
suppression of T levels in men. The current results indicated that the site of action must include a central (hypothalamic or pituitary)
effect, but additional direct testicular effects could not be excluded. Further work is required to assess the correlation between low T

levels and crizotinib side effects as well as the exact molecular mechanism and site of drug toxicity. Cancer 2012;118:5302-9. V

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 4% of patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (ALK) gene, leading to an oncogene-addicted state from aberrant ALK activation.1-9 Crizotinib, an oral ALK and
MET-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has produced a high response rate and prolonged median progression-free survival in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC.10 Side effects of crizotinib include grade 1/2 nausea (54%), diarrhea
(48%), visual disturbance (41%), constipation (24%), dizziness (15%), and fatigue (10%).10 Crizotinib (Xalkori;
Pfizer, New York, NY) recently received US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of patients with
advanced, ALK-rearranged NSCLC, a group that potentially represents >10,000 patients per year in the United States
alone.11
The potential for crizotinib-related hypogonadism came to our attention through an index case. A man aged 35 years
with metastatic NSCLC and an ALK rearrangement who received crizotinib (250 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles) for 14
cycles reported worsening fatigue and sexual disinterest. His most recent computed tomography scan demonstrated an
ongoing objective response. A complete blood profile, metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and total testosterone (T) level were assessed. Although the other blood results were normal, the T level was significantly low (130 ng/
dL; normal range, 241-850 ng/dL). The patient was referred to endocrinology, which highlighted recent data on hypogonadism in men with metastatic cancer patients being under diagnosed, under treated, and correlated with reduced quality
of life (QoL).12 On the basis of this information, from early 2011, we adopted a policy of offering standard-of-care T testing to all men with metastatic cancer within the Thoracic Oncology Program to identify and refer patients who might
benefit from testosterone therapy.
Although we identified a frequency of hypogonadism similar to that reported in the literature in our general
NSCLC population, the crizotinib-treated population was particularly affected.13-17 The incidence of low T in men
who were receiving crizotinib therapy and the observed rapidity of its onset and reversibility on withholding of the drug
are reported here, and its consequences and possible basis are discussed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The University of Colorado Thoracic Oncology Program
adopted a policy of screening all patients with NSCLC
who had tissue available for an expanding series of
molecular abnormalities from mid-2008.18 Testing is
conducted on-site within the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments-certified Colorado Molecular Correlates (CMOCO) laboratory. An institutional
review board-approved protocol permits clinical correlates
to be made on all in-house patients in whom molecular
analyses have been conducted within the CMOCO
laboratory. After identification of the index case and
recognition of the recently reported high incidence of low
T levels in patients with advanced cancer, all men with
metastatic NSCLC were offered T testing as part of routine clinical care. Because of our involvement in the early
clinical trials of crizotinib, a large group of crizotinibtreated patients (the crizotinib-treated group [CTG]) was
available for analysis. Crizotinib-treated patients received
crizotinib at a dose of 250 mg twice daily in 21-day or
28-day cycles. Measurement of T in patients with
metastatic NSCLC who had never received crizotinib
(the noncrizotinib-treated group [NCTG]) served as a relevant comparator group. For initial comparison purposes,
only patients with NSCLC who had ALK rearrangements
and were tested for T before receiving crizotinib but who
subsequently received crizotinib were included in the
NCTG.
Testosterone levels were measured using a chemiluminescent immunoassay on the ADVIA Centaur XP platform (Siemens, Washington, DC) at the University of
Colorado Hospital. Samples were obtained at clinic visits
(8am to 4pm) rather than at any consistent time of day.
Patients with proven or suspected hypogonadism (on the
basis of symptoms) had additional hormone assessments
to further explore the site of endocrine dysfunction.19,20
Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin (PRL) measurements were
performed using chemiluminescent immunoassays on the
ADVIA Centaur XP platform (Siemens). Several patients
who had low T had additional levels measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry followed
by radiolabeled T/equilibrium dialysis to calculate the
percentage of free T. In the initial comparison, when
T was measured more than once in the same patient, only
the first assay result was used.
Patient age, current NSCLC-directed therapy, and
previous therapy in terms of the total number of cycles of
separate cytotoxic chemotherapy and the number of cycles
of erlotinib or gefitinib therapy (1 cycle ¼ 28 days) were

recorded. Patients were classified as untreated at the
time of blood sampling if they had not received chemotherapy or targeted therapy within 28 days before the
T assessment. The presence or absence of brain metastases
was documented as well as the site of any intracranial metastases. If no brain magnetic resonance imaging studies
had been obtained in the 6 months before the measured
T level, then this field was documented as unknown.
Previous central nervous system-directed therapy with
whole-brain radiation treatment (WBRT) or stereotactic
radiation also was recorded. Current opiate and dexamethasone use (regular or as needed) at the time of the
T assay and serum albumin levels also were documented.
Information on fatigue, graded according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) (version 3.0) was available
only for crizotinib-treated patients through a retrospective
review of clinical trial documentation. Statistical significance in mean levels of T, FSH, LH, and PRL between
the CTG and the NCTG was calculated using a 2-tailed,
unpaired t test with Prism software (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, Calif).

RESULTS
Patient Demographics

Demographic characteristics of the patients with metastatic NSCLC who were tested for random T levels are
listed in Table 1. Nineteen patients who received crizotinib treatment for metastatic NSCLC were tested,
including 17 patients with ALK gene rearrangements, 1
patient with a c-ros oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine
kinase (ROS1) fusion gene, and 1 patient with MET
gene amplification. Three ALK-positive patients within
this group had T levels assessed both before and after
the initiation of crizotinib therapy. Nineteen patients
with metastatic NSCLC who did not receive crizotinib
therapy were tested, including 5 patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and 2
patients with ALK gene rearrangements (both were
crizotinib naive and were receiving pemetrexed-based
therapy at the time). The majority of patients in the
NCTG were receiving chemotherapy or erlotinib
(14 of 19 patients; 74%).
Patients in the CTG and the NCTG had a similar
median age (60 years and 63 years, respectively), similar
rates of brain metastases (26% each) assessed by magnetic
resonance imaging within the 6 months before the first
T assessment, and a similar frequency of receiving
previous WBRT (16% each) (Table 1). In the CTG, 8 of

19 patients (50%) had grade 1 or 2 fatigue, and there
were with no documented occurrences of grade 3 or 4
fatigue. NCI-CTCAE–graded symptoms were not
available for the NCTG. No patient in either group was
receiving concurrent corticosteroids.
Hormone Measurements

Testosterone levels were significantly lower in the CTG
compared with the NCTG (mean total T level, 131 ng/dL
5304

vs 311 ng/dL; P ¼ .0002) (Fig. 1). In the CTG, 19 of 19
patients (100%) had low T (<241 ng/dL) compared with
6 of 19 patients (32%) in the NCTG. Of 5 patients with
ALK-rearranged NSCLC who had T levels measured
before receiving crizotinib (including 2 patients who
remained on pemetrexed therapy at the time of the current analysis and have not yet received crizotinib therapy
and 3 patients who subsequently went on to receive crizotinib treatment), only 1 patient (20%) had low T (mean,
355.8 ng/dL). Free T levels also were low (<9 ng/dL) in
9 of 10 patients tested in the CTG (mean, 6.8 ng/dL).
No patients in the NCTG had free T levels measured.
There was no correlation between the time of day blood
was drawn for the hormone assay and the T level in
patients (r ¼ 0.04).
Measurements of FSH, LH, and PRL were available for 13 of 19 patients in the CTG with low T and
for 4 of 6 patients in the NCTG with low T (Table
2). Among the patients who had low T levels, there
were no significant differences between the CTG and
the NCTG in mean levels of FSH, LH, or PRL. Thyroid-stimulating hormone measurements were available
for 13 of 19 patients with low T in the CTG and in 4
of 6 patients with low T in the NCTG, and were all
within normal limits.

Dynamic Changes Associated With Crizotinib
Commencement

Two patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC who previously had normal T levels had documented, rapid
decreases in T within 14 to 21 days of initiating crizotinib
therapy (Fig. 2a). Levels of LH, which were elevated at
baseline, decreased in both patients over the same period
(Fig. 2b). FSH levels, which also were elevated at baseline,
decreased in 1 patient but remained stable in the other
patient (Fig. 2c).
Four patients in the CTG either temporarily held
crizotinib or permanently discontinued dosing because of
toxicity (neutropenia), concurrent radiotherapy, or progression, allowing for additional dynamic assessment of T
levels (Fig. 3). On each occasion, T levels increased within
days of cessation of crizotinib and, conversely, decreased
within days after reinstitution of crizotinib (Fig. 3).
Cancer

Simultaneous gonadotropin levels were not measured in
these patients.
All patients with low T attended the Endocrinology
Department to discuss the benefits and risks of testosterone therapy, and 10 of 19 patients subsequently commenced T therapy. When physiologic T in the form of
topical gel was instituted, T levels increased to the normal
range despite ongoing crizotinib therapy (data not
shown). No formal documentation of the frequency or
NCI-CTCAE–graded severity of specific hypogonadismrelated symptoms was made before or after patients
started T therapy.

who received crizotinib treatment, and based on an
increased recognition of the high frequency of hypogonadism in men with advanced cancer, we performed T
measurements in patients with metastatic NSCLC to
identify and refer patients who might benefit from physiologic T therapy.
Crizotinib treatment was associated with a 100%
incidence of low T in 19 patients tested, compared with
32% of patients with metastatic NSCLC who did not
receive crizotinib (Fig. 1). Patients in each group had similar use of opiates and dexamethasone and similar nutritional status as assessed by serum albumin and body mass
index. In addition, there was no difference between the
groups in the receipt of antiemetics (data not shown).
Patients in the CTG were slightly younger, excluding an
age-related impact on T levels as a major contributor to our
5306

observations.21 The CTG was more likely to have received
more cycles of prior chemotherapy, which may be associated with lower baseline T because of direct gonadal toxicity from the chemotherapeutic drugs (Table 1).17,22 Only 1
of 5 ALK-positive patients had low T levels when they were
not receiving crizotinib, excluding the molecular subtype of
cancer as the primary contributor to this observation.
Although there is a substantial background incidence of hypogonadism in patients with metastatic NSCLC,12,13 the
rapid dynamic changes in T with decreases after commencement and increases after cessation of treatment with
crizotinib in the CTG unequivocally demonstrate a direct
causal relation between the crizotinib and effects on the
hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis (Figs. 2, 3).

and FSH levels were tracked prospectively at the

commencement of crizotinib offers some initial insights
into the potential site(s) of drug toxicity (Fig. 2). Both LH
levels and FSH levels were above the upper limit of normal before crizotinib was commenced, suggesting some
prior gonadal damage (possibly from prior chemotherapy)
and a requirement for increased gonadotropin drive to
maintain normal T levels. After the initiation of crizotinib, although T levels rapidly fell, no compensatory
increase in gonadotropins was documented. In fact, LH
and FSH decreased over the same period, suggesting that
the mechanism of toxicity must include a central component that involves either the hypothalamus and/or the pituitary gland. Taken together, these data suggest either
that, in the presence of pre-existing gonadal damage, even
a minor reduction in gonadotropin drive can decrease T
levels, and/or that a direct gonadal effect of the crizotinib
also is occurring.
Additional insights can be gained by investigating
FSH, LH, and PRL levels both in the original CTG and
in the comparator low-T NCTG (Tables 1, 2). First, in
the NCTG, although the upper limit of the observed
range indicates that FSH and LH levels may be elevated in
some individuals, the mean FSH and LH levels are not
above the upper limits of normal for either gonadotropin.
This suggests that patients who have cancer with low T
indeed may manifest low T at FSH and LH levels that still
are within the normal range because of a requirement for
increased basal gonadotropin drive.17,22 Second, in the
CTG, despite prolonged crizotinib therapy, mean FSH
levels were not reduced but, in fact, were at the top of the
normal range; and neither FSH levels nor LH levels were
statistically significantly different from those in the
NCTG. This is in contrast to the immediate reductions in
gonadotropin levels noted in the changes illustrated for 2
patients in Figure 2 and raises some doubt about whether
a central effect alone is responsible for low T in crizotinibtreated patients. Because, in some crizotinib-treated
patients, FSH and LH levels can exceed the upper limit of
normal (as demonstrated by the upper end of the observed
range for each), we hypothesize that an additional, direct
gonadal effect of crizotinib probably exists.
Crizotinib is primarily an ALK and cMET inhibitor,
although other kinases also may be affected, depending on
drug exposure.23 Expression of both ALK and cMET has
been described in the testes.24,25 Expression of both ALK
and cMET also occurs throughout the central nervous system and has been described in some aspects of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.24-30 Assuming that action on
either ALK, cMET, or both is responsible for the observed
low T with concomitant reduction in gonadotropin levels,
Cancer

these expression patterns also are consistent with the
potential for both central and direct gonadal effects of
crizotinib.
Preclinical studies using kinase-specific inhibitors
are required to accurately determine whether the effect of
crizotinib is related to the inhibition of cMET, ALK, or
other receptor tyrosine kinase targets and the exact site(s)
of action in the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis.
Such studies also offer the potential for providing unique
insights into the molecular signaling pathways involved in
aspects of normal human endocrine physiology. If this is
entirely an ALK-specific effect, then the potential for
using T changes as a pharmacodynamic marker during
the early phase development of other ALK inhibitors
should be considered.31 In contrast, if it reflects a combination of both ALK and MET or other off-target kinase
inhibition, then hormone side effects offer the potential
to differentiate crizotinib from other more specific ALK
inhibitors currently in development.32
Because the detection of low T was noted after longterm use of crizotinib in the majority of patients, we were
unable to correlate the timing of the decrease in T with
the recorded side effects of therapy. Certainly some of the
side effects associated with low T (notably, fatigue) do
occur with crizotinib. In the index crizotinib-treated case,
the patient reported the development of persistent fatigue
after only 2 cycles of therapy despite responding to the
study drug, consistent with the timing of changes in T levels observed in our dynamic series (Fig. 2). Many symptoms of hypogonadism specific to low T, such as sexual
disinterest, erectile dysfunction, decrease in facial hair
growth, loss of muscle mass, and increase in fat mass, may
have been missed by study investigators who were not
investigating specifically for these features. To our knowledge, objective measurements, such as bone mineral density and muscle mass, which can alter with
hypogonadism, have not been assessed in any of the crizotinib studies to date.
Although the effect of crizotinib on T was reversible
on drug discontinuation, patients may remain on crizotinib for many months.10 The potential long-term consequences of undetected and untreated low T on crizotinib
in this population are unknown. Low T in cancer patients
has been correlated with reduced QoL, fatigue, and worsened survival.12,33 Total T and free T levels decline with
age,21,34 and cross-sectional surveys have reported a prevalence of hypogonadism, defined primarily by low T, of
approximately 20% to 40% in men aged >40
years.20,35,36 Studies in patients with metastatic cancer
have reported a higher prevalence in the range of 40% to
5307

Original Article

70% based on T levels,12,13 possibly related to malnutrition, opioid use, or prior cytotoxic chemotherapy causing
direct gonadal damage.13-17 Low T in cancer patients has
been correlated with fatigue, decreased QoL, sexual disinterest, and inferior survival.12,33 In addition, as T levels
fall with age, some older patients who have received crizotinib already may be manifesting hypogonadism and may
not notice drug-induced changes in their T levels. In contrast, the greater frequency of ALK gene rearrangements in
younger patients may render a significant proportion of
the crizotinib-treated population particularly susceptible
to experiencing the side effects associated with druginduced low T.32 In a noncancer population, extensive literature has documented that low T levels lead to sexual
dysfunction, depressive symptoms, and fatigue as well as
decreased muscle mass, decreased bone density. and
increased cardiovascular risk.37-40
Physiologic T treatment, in the form of transdermal
patches or gel, can normalize T levels, but the specific clinical benefits continue to be investigated. Two small trials
that evaluated T replacement in cancer patients reported
improved fatigue, reduced weight loss, and increased
physical activity but were unable to report improved
QoL.41,42 However, both of those trials included significant numbers of patients who had normal T levels, so the
effect of treatment in cancer patients with low T is uncertain. Therapy in noncancer patients leads to increased
bone density, improved muscle mass, increased hematocrit, and improved libido while potentially worsening
symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy and sleep
apnea.43-46 Although, anecdotally, our patients who were
receiving T treatment often reported reduced fatigue,
improved cognition, increased libido, and increased exercise tolerance (data not shown), a prospective clinical trial
will be required to formally assess whether T replacement
in crizotinib-treated patients with NSCLC leads to benefits and toxicities similar to those observed in other cancer
patients.
Whether crizotinib may have comparable
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal effects in women has not
yet been investigated. Cyclical effects in premenopausal
women and different reference ranges in postmenopausal
women make any initial assessments more complicated,
but these also could be addressed within a prospective
study.
In summary, low T levels were documented in all of
our male patients with metastatic NSCLC who received
crizotinib treatment. Changes appeared to be both rapid
and reversible on commencement and cessation of dosing,
respectively, confirming a direct causal relation with crizo5308

tinib. Given the observed decrease in FSH and LH levels
with commencement of therapy in several patients, the
site of action must include a central component, but additional, direct testicular effects cannot be excluded. In vitro
data will be required to fully understand the mechanism
of these effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular
axis. We suggest that clinicians should monitor T levels in
all men who receive crizotinib and should refer those with
low T for discussion of the risks and benefits of T therapy.
