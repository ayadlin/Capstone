ABSTRACT
Although evidence indicates that drug target genes share some common
evolutionary features, there have been few studies analyzing evolutionary features of
drug targets from an overall level. Therefore, we conducted an analysis which aimed
to investigate the evolutionary characteristics of drug target genes. We compared
the evolutionary conservation between human drug target genes and non-target
genes by combining both the evolutionary features and network topological properties
in human protein-protein interaction network. The evolution rate, conservation
score and the percentage of orthologous genes of 21 species were included in our
study. Meanwhile, four topological features including the average shortest path
length, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient and degree were considered
for comparison analysis. Then we got four results as following: compared with
non-drug target genes, 1) drug target genes had lower evolutionary rates; 2) drug
target genes had higher conservation scores; 3) drug target genes had higher
percentages of orthologous genes and 4) drug target genes had a tighter network
structure including higher degrees, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficients
and lower average shortest path lengths. These results demonstrate that drug target
genes are more evolutionarily conserved than non-drug target genes. We hope that
our study will provide valuable information for other researchers who are interested
in evolutionary conservation of drug targets.

INTRODUCTION

are related to drug discovery, including immunology [6],
physiology [7, 8], epidemiology [9] and neurosciences
[10]. Wang et al. [11] conducted an analysis and showed
that some targeted genes shared common evolutionary
features, which suggested that evolutionary information
might provide novel insights for characterizing drug
targets from new perspectives.
However, most of the current studies about
evolutionary conservation focus on a single gene or
several genes belonging to a same protein family, rather
than a large group of genes with same or similar features
[12–16]. Compared with conventional analyses of
evolutionary conservation, gene sets with a large number

Drug targets, a class of biological targets, are in
vivo binding sites which include receptors, enzymes,
ion channels and nucleic acids, etc. Drugs bind to
their corresponding targets and perform the desirable
therapeutic effects [1]. To date, thousands of drug targets
have been identified and stored in databases such as
DrugBank [2], Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) [3],
Potential Drug Target Database (PDTD) [4] and TDR
Targets Database [5].
Previous researches have shown that evolutionary
features offer fresh views to many important fields that

of genes can better reflect the characteristics of evolution.
In addition, evolution conservation can be not only
reflected by the general features such as evolutionary rate,
the percentage of orthologous genes and protein sequence
identity, but also by the network features [17, 18].
Therefore, we wondered whether there was difference
in evolutionary features between drug target genes and
non-target genes. We hoped to integrate comprehensive
evolutionary information and investigate the evolutionary
conservation characteristics of drug target genes from a
global perspective.
Therefore, we compared the evolutionary features
between drug target genes and non-target genes combining
both regular evolutionary features and some network
features. All the evolutionary features were categorized
into two groups: (1) evolutionary features of 21 species
including evolutionary rate, conservation score and the
percentage of orthologous genes; (2) topological features
of human protein-protein interaction network including
the average shortest path length, betweenness centrality,
clustering coefficient and degree. In this research, we
hope to explore the evolutionary conservation features of
drug targets and help to enhance the efficiency of target
identification.

of drug target genes was higher than that of non-target
genes. The Wilcoxon signed rank test gave a P-value of
6.40E-05 confirming that there was significant difference
in the conservation scores between human drug target
genes and non-target genes. For each of the 21 species, the
conservation scores of drug target genes are significantly
higher than that of the non-target genes (Figure 2B).
Detailed information about the conservation score for each
species is given in Table 2.

Drug target genes had higher percentages of
orthologous genes than non-target genes
We calculated the percentage of orthologous genes
of drug target genes and non-target genes for each species
and displayed the line chart of this evolutionary feature in
Figure 3, which showed that the drug target genes had a
higher percentage of orthologous genes than the non-target
genes. The P-value of Wilcoxon signed rank test was
9.54E-07 confirming that there was significant difference
in the percentage of orthologous genes between the two
groups of genes.

Drug target genes had a tighter network
topology structure than non-target genes

RESULTS
We further analyzed the topological properties of the
human protein-protein interaction network downloaded
from HPRD and extracted the network features of both drug
target genes and non-target genes. Then we compared these
features between drug target genes and non-target genes.
These following results were obtained: 1) The average
shortest path length of drug target genes was significantly
smaller than that of non-target genes (Figure 4A) and 2)
The betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient and
degree of drug target genes were significantly higher than
those of non-target genes (Figure 4B–4D). These results
showed that drug target genes had a tighter topological
structure than non-target genes in the human protein-protein
interaction network.

Drug target genes had lower evolutionary rates
than non-target genes
For each of the 21 species, we calculated the
evolutionary rate dN/dS of both the drug target genes and
non-target genes. We also respectively calculated the median
dN/dS of drug target genes and non-target genes for each
species and compared them using a line chart (Figure 1A).
The results showed that the median dN/dS of drug target
genes was significantly lower than that of non-target genes
(P = 6.41E−05). For each species, a box plot was given to
display the difference of dN/dS between the two groups of
genes (Figure 1B). The results of box plots and Wilcoxon
rank sum tests showed that the evolutionary rate of drug
target genes was lower than that of the non-drug target genes
for each of the 21 species. Detailed information about the
dN/dS for each species is given in Table 1.

DISCUSSION
It is an important task to investigate the evolutionary
conservation of drug target genes, which helps to well
characterize drug targets. In this study we analyzed
the evolutionary conservation of drug target genes by
comparing multiple evolutionary characteristics including
both classical features (evolutionary rate, conservation
score and percentage of orthologous genes) and network
topological properties (average shortest path length,
betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient and degree).
Through comprehensive analyses, we got consistent
results supporting that drug target genes were more
evolutionarily conserved during the evolutionary history.

Drug target genes had higher conservation
scores than non-target genes
We aligned the protein sequence of both human
drug target genes and non-target genes to the orthologous
protein sequence of the other 21 species by using BLAST
software and got conservation scores from the blast results.
The median conservation scores of the two gene sets for
21 species were calculated and displayed by a line chart
(Figure 2A) showing that the median conservation score

Previous studies about drug targets have identified
genes or genome regions with higher evolutionary
conservation as potential or candidate drug targets. For
instance, the nucleoprotein (NP) of the influenza A virus
which is a protein of high conservation was identified
as a potential target of universally effective antivirals
[19]. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), a ubiquitous group
of evolutionary conserved proteins, which are involved
in binding antigens and presenting them to the immune
system, were determined as possible therapeutic targets
[20]. Nonstructural proteins (NS3) are components of
flavivirus polyprotein. Shiryaev et al. [21] performed
a study focusing on the structural and functional
characteristics of flaviviral protease. They found that the
N-terminal and C-terminal parts of NS3 were composed
by serine protease and the RNA helicase. Individual
virus proteins were produced and a new progeny would
be assembled if the polyprotein was cleaved by protease
or RNA helicase. Since both the protease and the RNA
helicase were conserved among flaviviruses, NS3
was identified as a promising drug target in flaviviral
infections.

Furthermore, some genes or proteins involved
in conserved cellular progress such as DNA replication
and apoptosis during evolution can also be identified as
potential drug targets. For instance, Robinson et al. [22]
explored the architecture and conservation of the bacterial
DNA replication machinery and found that genes or
proteins involved in maintaining the machinery of DNA
replication had the greatest potential as drug targets.
The mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT) is a
mechanism that enables the secretion of Cytochrome-c
(Cyt-c), Apoptosis Inducing Factor (AIF) and other proapoptotic proteins which initiate and promote apoptosis.
A research conducted by Hellebrand et al. [23] suggested
that some mPT inhibitory agents might become promising
drug targets against apoptosis.
With the rapid development of computer technology
and machine learning theory, evolution information has
been used to identify and prioritize drug targets. Ludin et al.
[24] predicted antimalarial drug target candidates by
utilizing evolution information and found 40 candidate
drug targets with high evolution conservation. Another
study about drug target identification and prioritization

4964

Oncotarget

also indicated that many potential drug target genes could
be predicted by orthologues information [25].
The comparison analysis results obtained in our
study and the previous studies focusing on evolutionary
conservation of drug targets or drug target identification
based on evolution information suggest that drug targets are

closely correlated with evolution conservation and they are
characterized by higher evolutionary conservation during
evolution process compared with non-target genes. This
indicates that the results in our study are quite reliable and
they might have the potential to expand the understanding
of evolutionary characteristics of drug target genes.

Human drug target genes
Calculation of topological properties of human
protein-protein interaction network

The human drug target gene set used in our study
came from the DrugBank database that is a unique
bioinformatics and cheminformatics resource combing
detailed drug data with comprehensive drug target
information [2]. We downloaded the data of Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs and the
corresponding drug targets, which contained a total of 1857
terms for multiple species. We then extracted the human
drug targets from the original data and finally obtained 1347
FDA-approved drug target genes for the following analyses.

We downloaded the protein-protein interaction (PPI)
network data containing 39240 interaction pairs from the
Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) [33]. In the
PPI network, a node denotes a protein and a path denotes
a finite sequence of edges which connect proteins. Then
we calculated 4 topological properties which included
the average shortest path length, betweenness centrality,
clustering coefficient and degree [34] by using MCODE,
a plug-in of Cytoscape software [35]. The average shortest
path length reflecting how tight one node is connected to
the other nodes in a network is defined as the average
length of all shortest paths passing through a certain
node. The normalized betweenness centrality of node v
σ ivj
1
where
is defined as Bv =
∑
(n − 1)( n − 2) i ≠ j ≠v∈V σ ij
σ ij is the number of shortest paths from node i to node j

Non-target genes
With the purpose of getting non-target gene set, we
downloaded protein family data from Pfam database (ftp://
ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/releases/Pfam27.0/), a
collection of protein families, each represented by multiple
sequence alignments and hidden Markov models (HMMs)
[26], and obtained the human protein family information. After
filtering out the protein families to which drug targets belonged,
we got the non-target gene set containing 4181 non-redundant
genes. It’s worth noting that non-targets refer to those proteins
that do not have similar domains with target proteins.

and is the number of shortest paths passing through node
v out of σ ivj . The betweenness centrality is an indicator
used to measure a node’s centrality in a network. The
clustering coefficient in an undirected network is defined
2n
n
as CCv = 2 =
where n is the number of edges
Ck
k ( k − 1)

Calculation of evolutionary rate, percentage of
orthologous genes and conservation score

connecting the k direct neighbors of node v and Ck2 is
the max possible number of edges between k nodes. The
clustering coefficient represents the degree to which nodes
in a network tend to cluster together. The degree of node v
is the number of nodes directly connecting with node v. To
compare the network features of the drug target genes and
non-target genes, we extracted the topological properties
for the two gene sets.

We downloaded the orthologous gene data which
included 21 species from the Ensembl database [27–29] (ftp://
ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-69/mysql/ensembl_mart_69). The
full names and abbreviations of the 21 species can be found
in Table 3. Then we extracted one-to-one ortholog genes [30]
with non-null dN (rate of non-synonymous substitutions) and
dS (rate of synonymous substitutions) values and calculated
the evolutionary rate as the ratio of dN/dS.
For both drug target genes and non-target genes, we
counted the numbers of one-to-one orthologous genes in
each of the 21 species and then calculated the percentage
of orthologsous genes for each species.
Conservation score is defined as a score assigned
to each orthologous gene by sequence alignment between
species to determine how conserved a gene is. Here
the sequence conservation score is used to evaluate the
degree of similarity between a human sequence and
another species sequence for the orthologous gene. The
higher scores indicate the higher degree of conservation.
To compute the sequence conservation score, we
downloaded the pair-wise protein sequences of human
and other species from BioMart [31] (http://www.ensembl.

Statistical analysis
We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test to evaluate the
statistical significance of the difference in an evolutionary
feature or a network feature between the drug target genes
and non-target genes. We used the Wilcoxon signed rank
test to check whether the median of an evolutionary
feature of drug target genes was significantly different
from that of the non-target genes for each species. In
our study, Perl scripts were used for data processing
(http://www.activestate.com/activeperl) and R scripts
were used for statistical graphics and calculations
(http://cran.r-project.org).
