ABSTRACT
Let-7 microRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved well-established promoters of
terminal differentiation that are expressed in healthy adult tissues and frequently
repressed in cancer cells. The tumor suppressive role of let-7 in a variety of cancers
in vitro and in vivo has been widely documented and prompted these miRNAs to be
candidate genes for miRNA replacement therapy. In this study we described a new role
of let-7a in reprogramming cancer metabolism, recently identified as a new hallmark
of cancer. We show that let-7a down-regulates key anabolic enzymes and increases
both oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in triple-negative breast cancer and
metastatic melanoma cell lines. Strikingly, the accelerated glycolysis coexists with
drastically reduced cancer features. Moreover, let-7a causes mitochondrial ROS
production concomitant with the up-regulation of oxidative stress responsive genes.
To exploit these increased ROS levels for therapeutic purposes, we combined let-7a
transfection with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. In both cancer types let-7a
increased cell sensitivity to doxorubicin. Pre-treatment with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)
totally abolished this effect, indicating that the increased doxorubicin sensitivity of
let-7a cells depends on the redox pathway. We thus have demonstrated that let7a plays a prominent role in regulating energy metabolism in cancer cells, further
expanding its therapeutic potential.

INTRODUCTION

sharing a common seed sequence. Let-7 miRNAs are
involved in many physiological, as well as pathological
processes, with a primary role in the induction of terminal
differentiation and maintenance of this differentiated state
throughout lifespan. Many known let-7 target genes, such
as MYC, CCND1, RAS, LIN28 and HMGA2 are oncogenes
involved in cell cycle progression and stemness. Let7 levels were found to be low in a variety of primary
and metastatic tumors, and its loss or down-regulation
is associated with increased cancer aggressiveness and
poor clinical outcome [3-5]. Ectopic expression of let-7

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are evolutionarily conserved
small (18-25 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that modulate
gene expression by targeting mRNAs of protein-coding
genes. Let-7 miRNA was first identified in C.elegans as a
heterochronic gene, which promotes larval stage 4-to-adult
transition [1]. Further research on let-7 revealed a highly
conserved miRNA family present in vertebrates, ascidians,
hemichordates, molluscs, annelids and arthropods [2].
In humans, the let-7 family consists of 12 members, all

and suppresses tumor growth of human lung cancers in
vivo [6].
In recent years reprogrammed metabolism has been
recognized as a new hallmark of cancer [7]. The majority
of differentiated cells oxidize glucose to carbon dioxide
in the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle,
generating the amount of ATP necessary to maintain
cell homeostasis and to accomplish specialized cellular
functions. In contrast, rapidly proliferating cancer cells to
meet their metabolic demand activate aerobic glycolysis,
a phenomenon known as “the Warburg effect”. During
this process a significant part of glucose-derived carbon
is diverted into anabolic pathways in order to build up
biomass. A modulation of the glucose flux through the
glycolytic pathway together with cataplerotic removal of
TCA cycle intermediates allow cancer cells to optimize the
production of ATP and building blocks for macromolecular
synthesis [8]. Oncogenes such MYC and RAS induce
the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), while the tumor
suppressor protein TP53 represses PPP by inactivating the
rate-limiting enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) [9, 10]. Similarly, fatty acid synthase (FASN), the
key enzyme of de novo lipogenesis, is found to be highly
active in a large variety of cancers, and its up-regulation
is associated with chemotherapeutic drug resistance [11,
12]. Thus, counteracting the tumor’s anabolic activity may
offer a promising therapeutic strategy.
Although in many cancers mitochondria still remain
the major source of ATP, the truncation of the TCA cycle
caused by cataplerotic reactions or altered mitochondrial
biogenesis may decrease the efficiency of mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) [13, 14]. It has been
shown that cancer cells with predominantly glycolytic
metabolism are more malignant. Cells systematically
treated with the mitochondrial inhibitor oligomycin
repress OXPHOS and generate larger and more aggressive
tumors [15]. One consequence of ongoing OXPHOS is
the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). High
level of ROS is harmful for the cells. However, below
a toxic threshold, ROS play an essential physiological
role as signaling molecules. An increase in ROS levels
is required for a variety of stem cells to differentiate and
the treatment with exogenous ROS impairs stemness [1618]. Normal stem cells and cancer stem cells share this
property. Indeed, mammary epithelial stem cells and breast
cancer stem cells both contain lower ROS level than their
more mature progenitors [19]. An association between
advanced metastatic state and reduced ROS levels has
been shown in breast cancer [20]. Interestingly, a switch
from mitochondrial OXPHOS, the major cellular source
of ROS, to aerobic glycolysis is also observed during
the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells [21].
Taken together these data suggest an inverse association
between ROS level and stemness, where a lower level
of mitochondrial ROS and reduced mitochondrial
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activity correspond to a more de-differentiated state.
Furthermore, ROS levels have implications for anticancer
therapy, although the question is complex. On one hand,
increased levels of oxidants likely make cancer cells
more vulnerable to further damage by therapy-induced
exogenous ROS treatment. On the other hand, a persistent
intrinsic oxidative stress causes the up-regulation of ROS
scavenging system or employment of a “go or grow”
strategy making cancer cells better-adapted and thus more
resistant [20, 22].
Recently let-7 miRNA has been shown to regulate
glucose metabolism through m-TOR dependent and
m-TOR independent mechanisms in vitro and in vivo
[23, 24]. However, due to the metabolic heterogeneity
of cancer in general, in depth study of specific cancer
models is needed. In the present study we have addressed
the role of let-7 in regulating energy metabolism in triplenegative breast cancer and metastatic melanoma cell lines,
and explored the therapeutic potential of the miRNA
replacement therapy in vitro in combination with the
conventional anticancer drug doxorubicin.

RESULTS
Let-7a represses proliferation and clonogenic
capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells
To assess the validity of our model system, we first
investigated the protein level of three known let-7 targets,
CCND1, HMGA2 and LIN28A upon let-7a transfection.
Cells transfected with let-7a mimics (hereinafter let7a) or with negative control oligos (hereinafter negative
control) were lysed on day 3 post transfection and extracts
were subjected to Western blot analysis. The levels of
all three proteins were reduced to approximately 50% in
let-7a transfected cells compared to the negative control
(Fig. 1A). Interestingly, we observed that, in contrast to
the spindle-shaped, mesenchymal-like morphology of
untreated and negative control cells, the cells transfected
with let-7a became more columnar and epithelial-like
already 48 hours post transfection (Fig. 1B). Next, we
investigated the effect of let-7a overexpression on cell
growth. Cell growth was assessed by time-lapse live-cell
imaging based on cellular confluence. Cells transfected
with let-7a showed a time-dependent decrease in
confluence compared to the negative control cells (Fig.
1C). The cell number and viability were assessed using
Trypan Blue. As expected, let-7a significantly reduced the
final number of cells in culture (Fig. 1D) with no effect
on viability (Fig. S1A). Further analysis of caspase-3/7
activity to check for apoptosis revealed no difference
between let-7a transfected and negative control cells
(Fig. S1B). We performed colony formation assay to
determine whether ectopic expression of let-7a impairs the

stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) and 4-phosphopantetheinyl
transferase (AASDHPPT) (Table 1). Protein level changes
were further validated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 and
Table 1). Differentially expressed mRNAs and proteins
were compared with the list of predicted let-7a targets
and revealed that among anabolic genes only SCD is a
predicted let-7 target (Fig. S2B). Since these enzymes are
essential for macromolecular synthesis underlying cell
cycle progression, we performed a cell-cycle analysis.

revealed that the fraction of cells in S-phase is reduced by

clonogenic capability of MDA-MB-231 cells. The number
of colonies generated from single cells was drastically
reduced in let-7a treated samples (Fig. 1E and F), while
the size of the colonies did not differ (Fig. S1C).

Let-7a down-regulates key anabolic enzymes in
MDA-MB-231 cells
The effect of let-7a on global transcript levels was
determined using microarray. Rank product analysis was
employed to identify differentially expressed genes. The
analysis revealed 873 probes, representing 754 genes,
with significant changes in gene expression between let7a transfected and negative control cells. Of these, 357
genes were down-regulated whereas 397 genes were upregulated. Functional enrichment analysis of microarray
data (GEne SeT AnaLysis-GESTALT-Toolkit) identified
metabolic pathways to be highly enriched (Table S1).
To investigate differences at the protein level we used
SILAC-base proteome-wide analysis. We identified 37
proteins with significantly changed levels upon let-7a
transfection. Of these, 27 proteins were down-regulated,
and 10 proteins were up-regulated (Table S2). Comparison
of the mRNA and protein changes revealed that 54% of the
differentially expressed proteins were also changed in the
same direction at the mRNA level (Fig. S2A). Enrichment
analysis of changed proteins also showed metabolic
pathways as the first group in the top ten list (Table S1).
Among metabolic genes down-regulated by let-7a at
the transcriptional and/or protein level we identified key
enzymes of anabolic pathways, namely G6PD, inosine

After we observed the effect of let-7a on key
anabolic enzymes, we investigated whether let-7a
also affects other metabolic functions, such as energy
metabolism. Therefore, we examined mitochondrial
membrane potential using JC-1, a mitochondria specific
fluorescent probe that exhibits potential-dependent
accumulation in mitochondria, with a concomitant shift in
the peak of emission spectrum from green (≈529 nm) to
red (≈590 nm). We found that the mitochondrial membrane
potential was increased upon let-7a transfection (Fig. 3A),
indicating enhanced mitochondrial activity. To confirm the
specificity of the assay, we treated let-7a transfected cells
or negative control cells with the mitochondrial uncoupler

CCCP, which dissipates the proton gradient causing a drop
of the electrochemical potential across the mitochondrial
membrane. As expected, after CCCP treatment, no red
fluorescence was detected in negative control or in let7a treated cells, while the total mitochondrial content
was unchanged, as shown by the green fluorescence (Fig.
S3). To assess overall energy metabolism, we measured
the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the extracellular
acidification rate (ECAR) using the XFe Extracellular
flux Analyser. Let-7a increased basal respiration, but not
spear respiratory capacity (Fig. 3B). Surprisingly, let-7a
increased also basal ECAR (Fig. 3C). To investigate the
maximal glycolytic capacity, we performed glycolysis
stress test. Cells were incubated for 1 hour without glucose
and pyruvate, and then in sequence glucose, oligomycin
and 2-DG were added. The injection of oligomycin,
which blocks ATP synthase, increased ECAR in let-7a
cells significantly stronger than in negative control cells,
indicating higher maximal glycolytic capacity (Fig. 3D,
black and red lines). Of importance, even in the absence
of glucose, OCR was higher in let-7a cells, suggesting
that mitochondria utilize alternative carbon sources
more efficiently (Fig. 3D, grey lines). Mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation is the main source of ROS in a
cell, and increased OXPHOS should lead to higher ROS
production. Thus, we measured ROS level on day 2 and
day 3 post transfection using 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate (DCFDA). ROS level was increased up to
approximately 2-fold in let-7a transfected cells, but not
in negative control cells, in a time-dependent manner
(Fig. 3E). It has been widely demonstrated that there is
a positive correlation between mitochondrial membrane
potential and ROS production [25, 26]. Moreover,
mitochondrial ROS production is very sensitive to
uncoupling [27]. To confirm that the detected increase
in ROS is of mitochondrial origin, we pre-treated cells
with the mitochondrial uncoupler CCCP which totally
abolished the differences in ROS levels between let7a transfected and negative control cells (Fig. 3F). To
further validate the mitochondrial origin, we measured
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mitochondrial superoxide level using highly selective
dye. We found mitochondrial superoxide increased in let7a transfected cells compared to the negative control (Fig.
3G). Increased endogenous ROS level should sensitize
cells to further oxidative stress. To assess that, we treated
let-7a and negative control cells with the strong oxidant
TBHP. ROS levels triggered by TBHP were significantly
higher in let-7a cells than in negative control (Fig. 3H),
and growth repression was stronger (Fig. S4).
The acceleration of both glycolytic and OXPHOS
pathways in let-7a transfected cells may require higher
energy substrate influx and consumption. We thus
measured glucose uptake in transfected cells using the
fluorescent glucose analogue 2-NBDG. Let-7a treated
cells displayed higher glucose uptake than negative
control cells (Fig. 3I). The rate limiting glycolytic enzyme
pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) can accelerate or slow
down the glucose flux through glycolytic pathway by
modulating its enzymatic activity. We measured the PKM2
activity and found that it was higher in let-7a transfected
cells (Fig. S5).
Microarray analysis revealed that let-7a treatment
induced antioxidant response genes in parallel with ROS
(Table 2). Among them, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1)
has previously been shown to be induced by the let-7
family in human hepatocytes through the direct targeting
of transcriptional repressor BACH1 [28]. We assessed the
expression of these two genes and confirmed that HMOX1
is induced, while BACH1 is down-regulated by let-7a also
in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Fig. 3J).

To extend our findings to a cancer type of nonepithelial origin, we investigated the effect of let-7a on
the metastatic melanoma cell line WM239. The effect

MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4A, B and C). Interestingly,
similarly to MDA-MB-231 cells, melanoma cells also
displayed morphologic changes upon let-7a transfection;
the cells became rounder and lost the protrusions (Fig.
4D). Cell-cycle analysis showed that let-7a strongly
reduced number of cells in S-phase (Fig. 4E). We further
investigated mitochondrial membrane potential and
glucose uptake, and found both parameters higher in let7a transfected cells than in negative control cells (Fig.
4F and G). Similarly, endogenous ROS was increased in
let-7a, but not in negative control cells, and this increase

was abolished by CCCP treatment (Fig. 4H). Using
MitoSox we assessed that mitochondrial superoxide
level is increased in let-7a overexpressing cells (Fig. 4I).
However, contrary to the MDA-MB-231 cells, we did
not detect significant differences in OCR between let-7a
and negative control (Fig. S6). On the other hand, let-7a
transfected melanoma cells displayed stronger increase in
ECAR under glycolytic stress test (Fig. 4J), confirming
the data obtained in MDA-MB-231. Western blot analysis
showed that let-7a also in this cell line induced HMOX1
and repressed BACH1 (Fig. 4K).

Let-7a sensitizes breast cancer and melanoma
cells to doxorubicin

biosynthesis. Elevated TYMS level in cancer cells is
considered to contribute to multidrug resistance. Of note,
TYMS is a target of 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapeutic
drug used to treat a large variety of cancers [34]. IMPDH2
is a rate-limiting enzyme of the guanine nucleotide
biosynthesis, also essential for DNA replication. The
repression of these genes may be part of antiproliferative
function of let-7a. A growing body of evidence indicates
that FASN, the only enzyme that synthesizes fatty acids,
acts as an oncogene and its overexpression is associated
with poor prognosis in several malignant tumors [35,
36]. Thus, FASN has been considered as a target for
anticancer therapy [37]. AASDHPPT, also reduced by
let-7a, catalyzes the transfer of 4’-phosphopantetheine
moiety to the acyl carrier domain of FASN [38]. This posttranslational modification of the acyl carrier protein is
essential for the functional maturation of FASN. The third
enzyme of lipid biosynthesis pathway down-regulated by
let-7a is a fatty acid desaturase SCD, which is also shown
to be involved in cancer progression and considered to
be an attractive target for anticancer therapy [39, 40].
The coordinated down-regulation of genes involved
in nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis suggests a general
repression of anabolic metabolism induced by let-7
miRNA, which may contribute to its tumor suppressive
function.
Mitochondrial ROS formation, as a consequence of
ongoing OXPHOS process, is an important part of cellular
metabolism and plays an essential role in cell physiology.
The ROS species have for a long time been considered
harmful by-products of mitochondrial respiration.
However, there is growing evidence that ROS generated
by a variety of cellular processes act as signaling
molecules regulating a large number of different functions,
from immune response to differentiation [41]. Let-7
miRNAs promote a transition to terminal differentiation
during development and maintain this differentiated
state throughout life. In general, terminally differentiated
cells rely on OXPHOS, while stem cells and cancer cells
actively utilize aerobic glycolysis. Here we show that let7a activates OXPHOS, which results in the generation
of mitochondrial ROS in breast and melanoma cell lines.
Even though the endogenous ROS level was elevated
almost two-fold upon let-7a transfection, the cells did not
display signs of apoptosis, suggesting that this ROS level
was within a physiologic range. However, after treatment
with the strong oxidant TBHP, let-7a transfected cells
counteracted oxidative stress less efficiently than negative
control cells did, likely due to cumulative effect of
endogenous and exogenous ROS, which probably depleted
their antioxidant defense capacity. Importantly, a recently
published study has demonstrated that the epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) of basal-like breast cancer
is promoted by a metabolic switch to anaerobic glycolysis
resulting in decreased ROS level [42]. MDA-MB-231
cells are classified as basal-like CD44high/CD24low [43], and

The anti-cancer drug doxorubicin has been shown
to induce apoptosis through the generation of ROS [29].
However, this causes cytotoxicity in healthy tissues as
well. Obtaining therapeutic efficacy at lower drug doses
could reduce side-effects. We tested if the combination of
doxorubicin with let-7a could be beneficial in this respect.
Doxorubicin inhibited cell growth in both MDA-MB-231
and WM239 cells in a dose-dependent manner, but in
cells transfected with let-7a the effect of doxorubicin at
the lower concentrations was stronger than in negative
control (Fig. 5A). We hypothesized that this occurs
through the cumulative effect of ROS generated by let-7a
and by doxorubicin. If so, an antioxidant treatment with
NAC should abolish this effect. Pre-treatment of the cells
with NAC attenuated the doxorubicin effect in both let7a and negative control samples in a NAC concentrationdependent manner, with larger effect on let-7a transfected
cells (Fig. 5B). Altogether, these data support the
hypothesis that the increased sensitivity of let-7a treated
cells to doxorubicin is caused by the let-7a-induced ROS.
To assess if the reduction of cell number is due to the
apoptosis, we performed the caspase 3/7-based assay. In
melanoma cells let-7a strongly increased apoptotic death,
while in MDA-MB-231 the difference compared to the
negative control was not so pronounced (Fig. 5C).

DISCUSSION
A distinctive metabolic feature of all rapidly
dividing cells, including cancer cells, is the up-regulation
of key anabolic enzymes. By analyzing the global
transcriptome and proteome, we identified a number of
key metabolic enzymes down-regulated in MDA-MB-231
cells upon let-7a transfection. Importantly, all of them
fall into two major biosynthetic pathways: nucleotide
(G6PD, TYMS, IMPDH2) and lipid (FASN, AASDHPPT,
SCD) biosynthesis. G6PD is a rate-limiting enzyme of the
oxidative branch of PPP that yields ribose 5-phosphate, a
precursor for the de novo nucleotide biosynthesis, as well
as the reducing equivalent NADPH, an essential cofactor
of glutathione reductase. Inhibition of PPP causes NADPH
depletion with a consequent decrease of the reduced-tooxidized glutathione ratio [30]. A combination of reduced
G6PD level and increased endogenous ROS should lead
to the depletion of both NADPH and GSH. Surprisingly,
we did not detect any reduction neither in NADPH level,
nor in GSH (Fig. S8) in let-7a transfected cells, suggesting
that alternative cellular sources may replenish the NADPH
pool [31]. Both TYMS and IMPDH2 are up-regulated by
the MYC oncoprotein [32, 33], which is a target of let-7,
suggesting an indirect regulatory mechanism. TYMS is an
essential enzyme of de novo thymidine monophosphate

in these, even though let-7a accelerated glycolysis, it also
promoted mitochondrial OXPHOS and ROS production,
which usually is associated with a differentiated
phenotype. Another study has reported that increased
OXPHOS in cancer cells reduces cancer aggressiveness,
while decreased mitochondrial metabolism contributes
to cancer progression [44]. Our data support this concept
by showing an inverse correlation between the OXPHOS
and cancer aggressiveness, and suggest that let-7 might
counteract cancer-associated properties also at the
metabolic level by promoting a more differentiated state.
The increase in endogenous ROS was associated
with the coordinated up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes.
Among them, the HMOX1 increase is of particular
importance. In a recently published study, Hou W. et al
reported that let-7 induces HMOX1 by suppressing the
transcriptional repressor BACH1 in human hepatocytes.
Here we showed that let-7a overexpression induced
HMOX1 and repressed BACH1 also in breast cancer and
melanoma cell lines. HMOX1 catalyzes heme degradation
to release ferrous iron, carbon monoxide (CO) and
biliverdin. Biliverdin inhibits proliferative and angiogenic
pathways in head and neck cancer, while CO at low
concentrations has a potent anti-inflammatory effect [45,
46]. The induction of HMOX1 by let-7 might potentiate
anti-proliferative effects of let-7 on cancer cells while
decreasing inflammatory responses that often accompanies
tumor development.
Interestingly, we also found increased ECAR as
well as glucose uptake, indicating that let-7a enhances
glycolytic flux. Previously, let-7 has been shown to
regulate glucose metabolism through the repression of
mTOR pathway [23]. However, in breast cancer and
melanoma cell lines examined in our study let-7a did
not alter the phosphorylation status of mTOR nor of its
downstream component S6 (Fig. S7A and B). This is in
line with the recent study by Xiaoyu Ma et al., where they
showed that in hepatocellular carcinoma let-7 promoted
OXPHOS without affecting mTOR pathway [24]. Multiple
mechanisms governing the balance between glycolysis
and OXPHOS might exist in different cancer types, which
would reflect the metabolic heterogeneity and flexibility
of cancer cells. The main function of upregulated glucose
uptake and aerobic glycolysis in rapidly dividing cancer
cells is to provide anabolic precursors. However, the
repression of key anabolic enzymes and the decrease
in proliferation in let-7a overexpressing cells is not
compatible with acceleration of anabolic metabolism,
suggesting an alternative role for the sustained glycolysis
in these cells. Increase in ECAR has been seen during
adipocyte differentiation [47]. As a promoter of terminal
differentiation, let-7a might have triggered differentiation
processes by similar mechanisms, which could explain
the increase in the glycolytic rate. Furthermore, glycolysis
is the main source of energy for cellular morphological
transformations during differentiation [48, 49]. Dramatic

shape changes observed in both cell lines upon let-7a
transfection might therefore, at least partly, explain
increased need for glycolysis.
To extend our findings to a cancer type different from
the epithelial one, we overexpressed let-7a in the WM239
melanoma cell line. Although OCR was unchanged in let7a transfected cells, we detected increased mitochondrial
membrane potential and superoxide ROS level as well
as glucose uptake, while a pre-treatment with CCCP
abolished the ROS formation. Increased mitochondrial
activity, but not the oxygen consumption might derive
from defects in ETC complexes [50, 51]. Let-7a also
induced the expression of HMOX1 and repressed BACH1
in WM239 cells. These data reinforce the hypothesis of the
general biological role of let-7 in regulating mitochondrial
and redox metabolism.
Doxorubicin, a widely-used antitumor drug, blocks
mitosis by specific intercalation within the DNA double
helix. However, the treatment has severe side-effects,
such as cardiomyopathy, making it imperative to obtain
a therapeutic effect at the lowest dose possible. Let-7
miRNA is often reduced in cancer cells and the restoration
of its physiological levels is expected to have a therapeutic
potential [52]. We investigated whether cancer cells can
be sensitized to doxorubicin by increasing let-7a levels.
A combination of let-7a overexpression and doxorubicin
treatment produced a powerful effect on cell proliferation
at 0.25 µg/mL of doxorubicin, the lowest dose tested,
in both breast cancer and melanoma. The addition of
antioxidant NAC attenuated this effect indicating that it
occurred through the cumulative ROS level. In WM239
cells caspase-based apoptosis assay showed a striking
increase in apoptotic cells in let-7a sample after the
doxorubicin treatment, while in MDA-MB-231 cells
the difference in apoptosis between let-7a treated and
negative control cells was less prominent. The difference
between cell lines might be explained by another type of
ongoing cellular death, like necrosis, in MDA-MB-231
cells. In this study we uncovered a role of let-7 miRNA in
regulating energy and redox metabolism. Our data provide
a new insight into the tumor suppressive mechanisms of
let-7 miRNA and offers new therapeutic opportunities for
evaluation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culturing
The MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer
cell line was obtained from American Type Culture
Collection and the WM239 metastatic melanoma cell

Microarray analysis

MB-231 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 and WM239
in DMEM, both supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (all from Sigma, Steinheim, Germany), 1%
L-glutamate (GlutaMAX, Sigma) and 1% of penicillin G
and streptomycin sulphate (Sigma). Cells were passaged
twice a week in order to keep the cell confluence between
15 and 80%.

Total RNA was isolated by TriReagent (Ambion),
according to the manufacture’s instruction. Global mRNA
expression analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells on day 3 post
transfection with let-7a mimic or negative control oligos
was performed at the Oslo University Hospital Genomics
Core Facility (http://oslo.genomics.no), using the Illumina
HumanHT12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, San
Diego, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All
analyses were performed with species filter set to human.
For more details see SMM.

Transient transfection
Transient transfection was performed using 18
nM of let-7a pre-miRTM miRNA Precursors or Negative
control #2 oligos (Ambion, Grand Island, USA) and the
lipidic transfection agent Interferin (PolyPLUS, Illkirch,
France) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For
more details see Supplementary Material and Methods
(SMM).

Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell
culture (SILAC)
SILAC was performed using Pierce® SILAC Protein
Quantification Kit (Thermo scientific, Waltham, USA).
MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured for 4 days in SILAC
RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% of dialyzed
FBS and 50mg 13C6 L-lysine-2HCl/13C615N4 L-arginineHCl or L-lysine-2HCl/L-arginine-HCl according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. For detailed description see
SMM.

Western blotting
Total protein lysate was generated on day 3 post
transfection using 3% SDS lysis buffer. The protein
concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad Protein
Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, USA). Proteins of interest were
detected by primary antibody followed by the appropriate
secondary Ab (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark)). Relative expression of the detected proteins
normalized to α-tubulin was quantified using the Gene
Tools densitometry software (Syngene, Cambridge, UK).
Relative quantification is presented as a mean ± SD of at
least three independent experiments. For more details and
the list of Ab used see SMM.

Cell cycle analysis
On day 3 post transfection cells were trypsinized
and resuspended in culture medium. 2 µg/mL of Hoechst
33342 (Thermo Scientific) were added, and the cell
suspension was incubated for 20 min at 37°C. 1x105 cells
per sample were analyzed by flow cytometry at excitation/
emission = 346/497 nm on LSR II (Becton Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, USA). The data were processed by
FlowJo Version 7.2.4 (Tree Star, Ashland, USA) and
Dean-Jett-Fox model was applied. Results are presented
as a mean fold-change ± SD of at least three independent
experiments.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Isolation of total RNA and cDNA synthesis were
performed using Cell-to-Ct kit for mRNA (Ambion),
following the manufacturers protocol. Reaction mix
for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was
prepared using cDNA from 100 to 500 cells/well and
TaqMan gene expression master mix (Ambion). The
relative expression levels were determined using the
comparative threshold cycle (2−ΔΔCT). Ct values were
normalized to the endogenous internal control genes
TBP or GAPDH which maintained stable expression
levels through experiments. Normalized Ct values were
presented relative to negative control oligos. Results are
presented as a mean ± SD of at least three independent
experiments. For more details and the list of primers used
see SMM.

Mitochondrial membrane potential

On day 2 post transfection 800 cells/well mixed
with Methylcellulose-based medium (MethoCult™
H4100 STEMCELL technologies, Grenoble, France)
supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and
60% DMEM, were seeded in 24-well low adhesion
plates in triplicates. Cells were incubated at 37°C for
10-14 days and subsequently stained with 0.4 mg/mL
of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) for four hours (Life Technologies,
Grand Island, USA). Colonies larger than 50 µm were
detected and counted on the Gel Count (Oxford Optronix,
Abingdon, UK). Quantification is presented as an average
fold-change to negative control ± SD of at least three
independent experiments.

Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured
using the JC-1 fluorescent dye (Invitrogen). On day 3
post transfection, cells were treated with 2 µM of JC-1
and incubated for 45 min at 37°C. As a control for JC-1
specificity, additional samples were co-treated with 10
µM of CCCP or DMSO only. 1x105 cells per sample were
analyzed using LSR-II(BD) flow cytometer with laser 488
and emission filter 525/50 nm for green signal and laser
561 and emission filter 582/15 for red signal. Data were
processed by FlowJo v7.6.5. Signal from aggregates (red)
and monomers (green) of JC-1 was normalized to negative

Cellular ROS level

and

extracellular

Cellular ROS level was assessed using
2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) Assay Kit
(Abcam, Cambrige, UK). On day 3 post transfection,
cells were collected into flow cytometry tubes in
culture medium supplemented with 20 µM DCFDA
and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. 50 µM of tert-butyl
hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) was used as a ROS positive
control according to the manufacturer’s protocol. During
incubation the cells were re-suspended periodically by
shaking. To dissipate the mitochondrial proton gradient,
10 µM of CCCP or DMSO-only control was added to the
cells together with DCFDA and incubated for 1.5 hour at
37°C. 1x105 cells per sample were analyzed at excitation/
emission = 485/535 nm. Results are presented as a mean
± SEM of at least three independent experiments. For
superoxide detection MitoSOX fluorescent dye was
used (Lifetechnology). On day 3 post transfection cells
were trypsinized and resuspended in the culture medium
with 5 µM of MitoSOX dye, incubated for 25 min and
subjected to the flow cytometry. 1x105 cells per sample
were analyzed at excitation/emission = 510/580 nm.

Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular
acidification rate (ECAR) were measured with a XFe
Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience,
North Billerica, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cells were seeded in Seahorse plate on day
2 post transfection and cultured overnight to reach 80%
confluence. One hour before the measurement, the culture
medium was replaced with the cellular assay medium
(Seahorse Bioscience) and incubated for 1 hour in a
CO2-free incubator. The mito- and glyco stress-test were
performed according to Seahorse protocols, with the final
concentrations of 1µM FCCP, 1µM oligomycin and 1µM
rotenone, and 10mM of glucose, 1µM of oligomycin and
100mM of 2-Deoxy-D-glucose, respectively. OCR and
ECAR were normalized to the protein concentration and/
or DNA content in each well at the end of the experiment.
Results are presented as an average fold-change ± SD of
at least three independent experiments.

Glucose uptake

Doxorubicin experiment

Glucose uptake was measured using a fluorescent
glucose analogue 2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol4-yl)Amino)-2-Deoxyglucose (2-NBDG) (Invitrogen).
Briefly, on day 3 post transfection culture medium
was replaced with fresh medium containing 50 µM of
2-NBDG. The cells were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C.
1x105 cells per sample were analyzed by flow cytometry
at excitation/emission = 465/540 nm on LSR II. The data
were processed by FlowJo Version 7.2.4. Results are
presented as a mean fold-change ± SEM of at least three
independent experiments.

1000 cells/well were seeded 48 hours post
transfection in 96 well-plate in culture medium and
allowed to adhere. Subsequently, doxorubicin (CAELYX)
was added to the cells in five different concentrations:
0.25 µg/mL, 0.5 µg/mL, 1 µg/mL, 1.5 µg/mL and 2 µg/
mL. Cells were monitored in the Incucyte to estimate
the cell growth, n=5. For the NAC experiment, cells
were pre-treated with 2.5 mM or 5 mM of NAC 2 hours
before the addition of doxorubicin and followed in the
Incucyte, n=5. The cell confluence of doxorubicin-treated
cells was normalized to the cell confluence of untreated
