ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most prevalent and malignant form of a
primary brain tumour, is resistant to chemotherapy. In this study, we concurrently
loaded three chemotherapeutic agents [bis-chloroethylnitrosourea, irinotecan,
and cisplatin; BIC] into 50:50 poly[(d,l)-lactide-co-glycolide] (PLGA) nanofibres
and an antiangiogenic agent (combretastatin) into 75:25 PLGA nanofibres [BIC
and combretastatin (BICC)/PLGA]. The BICC/PLGA nanofibrous membranes
were surgically implanted onto the brain surfaces of healthy rats for conducting
pharmacodynamic studies and onto C6 glioma-bearing rats for estimating the
therapeutic efficacy.
The chemotherapeutic agents were rapidly released from the 50:50
PLGA nanofibres after implantation, followed by the release of combretastatin
(approximately 2 weeks later) from the 75:25 PLGA nanofibres. All drug concentrations
remained higher in brain tissues than in the blood for more than 8 weeks. The
experimental results, including attenuated malignancy, retarded tumour growth, and
prolonged survival in tumour-bearing rats, demonstrated the efficacy of the BICC/
PLGA nanofibrous membranes. Furthermore, the efficacy of BIC/PLGA and BICC/PLGA
nanofibrous membranes was compared. The BICC/PLGA nanofibrous membranes
more efficiently retarded the tumour growth and attenuated the malignancy of C6
glioma-bearing rats. Moreover, the addition of combretastatin did not significantly
change the drug release behaviour of the BIC/PLGA nanofibrous membranes. The
present advanced and novel interstitial chemotherapy and targeted treatment provide
a potential strategy and regimen for treating GBM.

administered [1, 2]. However, the median survival rate of
patients with GBM has not significantly changed, despite
more than two decades of researches on the development
of various agents and delivery systems [3–5]. The
tumour location is associated with the poor penetration
of drugs through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and also

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has been the most
prevalent and malignant type of cancer in the central
nervous system (CNS). GBM has a median survival
rate of around 12–15 months when standard treatment is

within the tumour. Moreover, established resistance to
chemotherapy and radiation therapy; the highly infiltrative
nature of tumour cells; genetic, morphological, and
molecular heterogeneity; and an extremely developed but
inadequately functioning neovasculature contribute to a
poor prognosis in patients with GBM [4, 6, 7].
GBM develops a unique neovasculature which is
highly permeable to macromolecules and small particles.
The disruption of the BBB is a regional incident occurring
in the tumour core, whereas in its growing margins the
BBB remains intact. Therefore, typically, the efficacy of
systemic drug therapy cannot be completely realised since
most anti-carcinoma agents fail to cross the BBB and thus
do not reach therapeutic concentrations in the tumour
[8–10].
Interstitial chemotherapy is able to deliver high
strengths of chemotherapeutic agents directly to the brain
tumour with minimum systemic toxicities [11]. Carmustine
or 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) wafers
(Gliadel; Guilford Pharmaceuticals, Baltimore, MD, USA)
show an increasingly popular approach for delivering
chemotherapy, theoretically supplying high concentrations
of chemotherapeutic doses locally while minimising
systemic adverse effects [12, 13]. These biodegradable,
BCNU-impregnated polymers are implanted in the tumour
bed during resection, thus providing a controlled release
of local chemotherapy. However, patients who received
the Gliadel wafer treatment survived only about 2 months
longer than those who did not receive the treatment
[14, 15]. Interstitial chemotherapy using biodegradable
polymers that are directly delivered to the brain appears
to be a safe and efficacious therapy for recurrent or
newly diagnosed high-level gliomas, but the therapeutic
effect requires improvement for yielding greater survival
benefits.
Cisplatin is a platinum compound consisted of
two chloride atoms and two amine groups. Once it is
introduced into the body, water molecules will displace
the chloride atoms; leading to the crosslinking of the
hydrated complex crosslinks with DNA strands and
triggering programmed cell death. Cisplatin reduces the
in vitro arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT)
activity and is considered as an active agent, in addition
to nitrosoureas, for treating glioma [16]. Furthermore,
irinotecan, a camptothecin derivative that restrains
topoisomerase I, is an indispensable enzyme necessary
for the relaxation of supercoiled DNA, which causes
topological variations that promote RNA transcription and
DNA replication [17]. Irinotecan is approved for treating
metastatic colorectal cancer and is a recommended drug
for treating the recurrent and intractable forms of this
disease that has evolved despite medical treatment with
fluorouracil [18]. Moreover, combretastatin A4 (CA4)
phosphate (CA4P), a tubulin-binding vascular disrupting
agent, targets the existing vasculature of tumours, causing
a rapid vascular shutdown, resulting in cell death and

central necrosis [19, 20]. Combretastatin is undergoing
phase II trials for use in treating ovarian, lung, and
anaplastic thyroid cancer [19, 21].
In this work, the authors concurrently loaded
the BCNU, irinotecan, and cisplatin (BIC) into 50:50
poly[(d,l)-lactide-co-glycolide] (PLGA) nanofibres
and combretastatin into 75:25 PLGA nanofibres. The
in vivo drug concentration was examined. Thereafter, the
anticancer agents embedded nanofibrous membranes were
implanted onto the brain surfaces of glioma-bearing rats
for administering combined (drug cocktail) chemotherapy
and sequential targeted therapy. The tumour growth rate,
rat survival rate, and pathological data were evaluated for
determining the therapeutic efficacy of the drug-loaded
nanofibres and their potential in treating GBM.

RESULTS
Drug-loaded nanofibrous membranes were
successfully prepared using suitable processing conditions.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photos of the
nanofibres, under 5000× magnification, suggested that the
diameters of the electrospun drug-loaded PLGA nanofibres
ranged between 375 and 1200 nm with a high porosity.

In vivo release behaviours of chemotherapeutic
pharmaceuticals from nanofibres
After the rats that succumbed during the
perioperative period (due to anaesthesia overdose or
massive blood loss) and those with brain injury, including
brain, wounds, or systemic infection were excluded,
at least five rats at each time point were enrolled for
analysing BIC and combretastatin (BICC) concentrations.
In vivo concentrations were characterised for 8 weeks
through high-performance liquid chromatography. The
BICC/PLGA nanofibrous membranes progressively
degraded, yielding small residual PLGA nanofibres at
the end of the study (Figure 1 c1–c4). Furthermore, the
in vivo release characteristics of BICC from the anticancer
agents embedded nanofibers are presented in Figure 2.
The chemotherapeutic agents were rapidly released from
the BICC/PLGA nanofibrous membranes. On Day 3, the
cisplatin concentration was the highest (660.47 ± 406.71
μg/mL), and the drug concentrations in the blood were
the lowest (0.67 ± 0.13 μg/mL); the brain–blood drug
concentration ratio was 985.78. For all the chemotherapeutic
agents, the brain–blood drug concentration ratios reached
their maximum values on Day 3 and were 115.76 and
272.59 times for BCNU and irinotecan, respectively.
The drug concentrations in brain tissues remained high
(approximately 100 μg/mL) and exceeded those in the
blood during the entire study (8 weeks). Furthermore,
the drug concentrations in the blood slowly increased
with the degrading PLGA nanofibres and reached the
highest concentration on Day 56. All brain–blood drug

concentration ratios were at their minimum values on
Day 56 and were 44.88, 77.03, and 20.89 times for
BCNU, irinotecan, and cisplatin, respectively. However,
the concentrations of BCNU, irinotecan, and cisplatin
were considerably higher in the cerebral cavity than in
the plasma (systemic). Drug concentrations differences
between the brain and blood reached significance at every
time point (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the release behaviour
of all the chemotherapeutic agents from the BICC/
PLGA nanofibrous membranes was comparable with that
from the BIC/PLGA nanofibrous membranes, with no
statistical difference (Figure 2). In the first 2 weeks, the
combretastatin concentration remained low (below 10
μg/mL), thereafter progressively increasing to more than
100 μg/mL in the third week (152.82 ± 73.13 μg/mL) and
reaching the maximum concentration in the fourth week
(274.68 ± 113.17 μg/mL), with the highest brain–blood
drug concentration ratio (263.46). The high brain–blood
drug concentration ratio lasted until the end of the study
(39.12 in the eighth week).

The rats that died during the perioperative period,
developed wound infection, or failed to develop glioma
were excluded. A total of 56 glioma rat models were
successfully created, which was confirmed through
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Excluding
the eight tumour-bearing rats that were sacrificed
for pathological examination, 15, 17, and 16 rats
were included in the control, BIC, and BICC groups,
respectively. In the control group, 14 rats died within
4 weeks of tumour implantation; only one rat survived
for more than 4 weeks and died on Day 56. The median
survival time was 22.87 ± 8.21 days in the control
group, whereas the median survival times were 60.00 ±
44.43 days and 86.50 ± 48.41 days in the BIC and BICC
groups, respectively. Moreover, the survival period was
significantly shorter in the control group than in the BIC
(P = 0.026) and BICC groups (P < 0.001). Furthermore,
the Kaplan–Meier survival curves in Figure 3 suggested

that the overall survival rate was higher in the BIC and
BICC groups than in the control group (P < 0.001).
Nevertheless, the difference did not show statistical
significance (P = 0.077).

The tumour volumes were reconstructed and
analysed employing the open-sourced, Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved Digital Imaging
and Communication in Medicine software OsiriX.
The mean tumour volumes before the membrane
implantation (approximately 10–12 days after tumour
cell incubation) were 60.36± 38.69 × 10−3 mL, 46.32 ±
19.32 × 10−3 mL, and 59.12 ± 321.19 × 10−3 mL in the
control, BIC, and BICC groups, respectively. The mean
tumour volumes were lower in the BIC group; however,
the difference was not statistically significant. After the
implantation, the tumour volumes rapidly increased in
the control group, with tumour volumes of 418.13 ±
396.10 × 10−3 mL, 866.00 ± 498.52 × 10−3 mL, 719.07
± 430.94 × 10−3 mL, and 647.07 ± 723.26 × 10-3 mL at
1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks, respectively. The tumour volumes
also rapidly increased in the first week in the BICC
group, and the estimated tumour volume was 401.99
± 162.61 × 10−3 mL. Furthermore, the tumour volumes
slightly increased and reached the maximum value
(427.98 ± 392.92 × 10−3 mL) at 2 weeks; thereafter, the
tumour volumes clearly decreased, with a mean volume
of 140.59 ± 212.44 × 10−3 mL, 119.55 ± 149.02 × 10−3
mL, 20.44 ± 9.40 × 10−3 mL, 6.68 ± 6.34 × 10−3 mL,

MRI examination
Approximately 10–12 days after C6 glioma cell
implantation into the rat brains, T1- and T2-weighted
images were taken for confirming the successful creation
of the glioma models. A series of brain MRI inspections
were completed before the membrane being implanted
and at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 22 weeks after the
implantation. A high percentage (43.75%) of the rats
in the BICC group exhibited complete responses, and
31.25% exhibited partial responses, whereas 25% of
the rats exhibited no response. Furthermore, in the BIC
group, approximately half of the rats (47.06%) exhibited
partial responses, a similar percentage (46.67%) of
them exhibited no response, and only two rats (11.76%)
displayed complete responses. Relatively, no animals in
the control group showed a complete response; only one
rat displayed a partial response, and most rats (93.33%)
rapidly died (Table 1).

and 2.46 ± 2.97 × 10−3 mL at 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 weeks,
respectively. The tumour volumes increased more
slowly in the BIC group, with a volume of 272.05 ±
207.05 × 10−3 mL in the first week, which was less than
the volume in the control and BICC groups (P = 0.429,
statistically nonsignificant). Moreover, the tumour
volumes slowly increased and reached the maximum
value (401.44 ± 460.62 × 10−3 mL) in the fourth week.
Furthermore, the repeated measures mixed model
analysis of tumour volumes in the control, BIC, and
BICC groups is presented in Figure 4. The tumour
volumes rapidly increased in the control group, whereas
the volumes gradually increased in the first 4 weeks
and decreased thereafter in the BIC group. In the BICC
group, the tumour volumes increased and reached the
maximum value at 2 weeks and then decreased more
than that in the BIC group. The difference among the
three groups was statistically significant (BIC versus
BICC group, P = 0.045; BICC versus control group,
P < 0.001; and BIC versus control group, P = 0.004).
Figure 5a presents the serial MRI scans of the
animals in the control group. The implanted tumour
rapidly grew and resulted in an intense mass effect
(midline shift and brain stem compression), eventually
causing the rats to die. Figure 5b illustrates the serial
brain MRI scans of the animals in the BIC group, in

which the created tumour grew more slowly than in
the animals in the control group. The tumour volumes
decreased between Weeks 4 and 8 and thereafter
progressively regrew and caused the death of the rats in
Week 23. Figure 6 presents the serial brain MRI scans
of the rats in the BIC group. The initial tumour volume
(62.73 × 10−3 mL) was similar to the mean tumour
volume in the control group (60.36 ± 38.69 × 10−3 mL).
The tumour slowly grew and reached the maximum
value in Week 4 and thereafter decreased steadily and
nearly disappeared at the end of the study.

In both the BIC and BICC groups, the GFAP expression
progressively increased. The Ki-67 labelling index was
22.84% ± 7.93% and 45.98% ± 11.57% in Weeks 4–6 and
8–12, the Ki-67 index was high and markedly increased in
the control group. By contrast, this index was 15.98% ±
7.31% in Weeks 4–6 and decreased to 11.41% ± 4.13% in
Weeks 8–12 in the BIC group. This index was much lower
in the BICC group than that in the control and BIC groups
(7.29% ± 1.35% and 0.79% ± 0.55% in Weeks 4–8 and
10–14, respectively).

Glioblastoma has a poor prognosis and is
considered an extremely chemoresistant tumour.
Despite modern therapies, malignant gliomas
virtually always relapse, typically appearing within 2
cm of the previous resection site. [22, 23] The BBB
protects the brain from toxic agents; nevertheless, it
also significantly impedes the delivery of therapeutic
pharmaceuticals to the brain. Various strategies are used
for delivering drugs across the BBB; however, some

strategies may structurally harm the barrier. Among the
different available approaches, the delivery methods
based on nanobiotechnology provide the most desirable
prospects to achieve ideal drug delivery [9, 24].

Nanoparticles have their own identity and structural
stability according to covalent bonds or strong ionic
interaction and may be designed to convey therapeutic
agents or other molecules without disturbing the

normal brain functions. The potential mechanism of
nanoparticle-mediated drug transport across the BBB
is determined by the chemistry, architecture, and
properties of the nanoparticles [9]. Nanoparticles may
be particularly useful for the treatment of disseminated
and very aggressive brain tumours [22]. Polymeric
nanoparticulates are nano-scaled carriers (1–1000 nm)
that are composed of natural or synthetic polymers,
where the pharmaceuticals can be embedded in a solid
state, dissolved in a solution, or adsorbed or chemically
bound to the surface. The employment of polymeric
nanoparticles has become one of the most promising
approaches for drug delivery to the CNS [25, 26].
The role of chemotherapy in managing GBM
has remained controversial because of the frequently
disappointing results reported in previous clinical trials.
Drug transport may restrict the intracerebral delivery of
chemotherapy; however, the major reason of therapeutic
failure is mainly tumour resistance to chemotherapy [4].
New chemotherapeutic strategies involve the combined
use of multitargeted drugs, cytotoxic chemotherapy
and radiotherapy for enhancing therapeutic efficacy
and overcoming tumour resistance [6, 27, 28].
Later studies have shown that combining irinotecan
and alkylating agents, especially BCNU, increases
antitumour influences to a scale that is substantially
higher than the additive effects of individual agents
[29]. Irinotecan and BCNU act synergistically against
CNS tumour cell lines [30]. In a phase II clinical trial,
the consolidation of irinotecan with BCNU was active
against recurrent or newly identified malignant glioma
compared with irinotecan only but with no obvious
raised toxicity [17, 30]. Dazzi et al. treated 15 patients
with GBM by using the following regimen: BCNU
(40 mg/sqm/die) and cisplatin (40 mg/sqm/die) were
concurrently managed for 3 days every 3–4 weeks, with
radiotherapy of 45-Gy whole cranial irradiation plus a
15-Gy raise on the preoperative volume. This sequential
chemoradiotherapy regimen was significantly active in
adult patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas
[31]. Furthermore, in a phase II study, Grossman et
al. reported that the continuous infusion of BCNU
and cisplatin followed by cranial irradiation seems to
exhibit significant activity and may extend survival in
patients with newly diagnosed high-grade astrocytoma
[32]. Alba et al. administered a new cisplatin plus bid
temozolomide regimen to 50 patients with recurrent
GBM. A bid regimen of temozolomide strongly
inhibited O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyltransferase, and
cisplatin reduced the AGAT activity in vitro, suggesting
a possible synergistic association. Their new cisplatin
in combined with bid TMZ regimen was vigorous in
chemotherapy-naïve patients with recurrent GBM and
caused acceptable toxicity [16].
GBMs are among the most vascular tumours, and
hence, tumour-associated vasculature is an attractive
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

therapeutic target [33]. Preclinical models show that
antiangiogenic therapy causes temporary vascular
normalisation, resulting in increased blood flow. The
improved flow subsequently enhances the transport of
oxygen and chemotherapeutic agents, thus increasing the
efficacy of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy [34, 35].
Furthermore, preventing the development of resistance
may require antiangiogenic schemes that give rise to
apoptosis or death of the neovasculature. The potential
role of circulating endothelial progenitor cells and vascular
cooption by tumour cells is also critical [33]. CA4P is a
water-dissolvable prodrug of CA4, which is a vasculartargeting and microtubule depolymerising agent. The
mechanism underlying the effects of this drug involves the
binding of CA4 to the tubulin, resulting in cytoskeletal and
then morphological variations in endothelial cells. These
alterations raise vascular permeability and disturb the
tumour blood flow. Furthermore, in experimental tumours,
antivascular influences are observed within few minutes
of drug administration and quickly cause widely ischemic
necrosis in regions that often show resistance to traditional
anticancer treatments [36]. CA4P in combination with
bevacizumab appears safe and well tolerated in this dosing
schedule. CA4P induces profound vascular changes, which
are maintained by bevacizumab [19].
The majority of chemotherapeutic agents should
be administered through intravenous infusion, and
combined multiple agent therapy potentially raise the
systemic toxicity and medical costs. The procarbazine,
CCNU (lomustine), and vincristine (PCV) combination
regimen has been widely employed to treat malignant
glioma. Because of the latent toxicity of BCNU
to lung, lomustine has been adopted in the PCV
regimen [23, 37]. Due to the high occurrence of
hematologic toxicities, the treatment regimen was
continuously modified (lomustine, 110 mg/m2 on Day 1;
procarbazine, 60 mg/m2 on Days 8–21; and vincristine,
1.4 mg/m2 on Days 8 and 29, with the cycle repeated
every 6 weeks) [23]. In the present study, we used
biodegradable polymeric nanofibres loaded with three
chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms
and an antiangiogenic agent for achieving sequential
and targeted interstitial chemotherapy to avoid systemic
toxicity. Surgery remains the fundamental treatment for
GBM, through which the tumour bulk is eliminated.
The peripheral infiltrating component then becomes
the objective of supplementary therapies, such as
chemotherapy and radiotherapy [22, 38]. The interstitial
chemotherapy proposed in this study was administered
through a simple process by placing the drug-loaded
membranes onto the brain surface after surgically
removing the tumours. Compared with the present
interstitial chemotherapy, the Gliadel wafer, the BICC/
PLGA nanofibrous membranes can be more easily
operated on and cut into any shape to conform to the
brain surface after tumour removal. The membrane also

provides a longer therapeutic period (more than 8
weeks) than does the Gliadel wafer (5–7 days), which
can increase therapeutic efficacy and reduce resistance.
The polymeric nanofibres as nanocarriers can protect
drugs and deliver them across the BBB for targeting a
specific brain cell population [39]. Chemotherapeutic
agents and antiangiogenic agents are released from
degrading nanofibrous membranes for achieving high
and low drug concentrations in the treatment area
(brain tissues) and blood (systemic), respectively,
thus minimising systemic toxicity. High levels of drug
concentrations at the target site and the use of combined
multiple chemotherapeutic agents overcome the
resistance of tumour cells and enhance the therapeutic
efficacy. In our study, the median duration of survival in
the BICC, BIC, and control groups was 86.50 ± 48.41,
60.00 ± 44.43, and 22.87 ± 8.21 days, respectively. No
statistical significance was observed between the BIC
and BICC groups; however, differences between the
BICC and control groups (P < 0.001) and between the
BIC and control groups (P = 0.01) achieved statistical
significance. The survival rate was not statistically
significant between the BIC and BICC groups;
however, the survival rate of the BIC and BICC groups
was statistically higher than that of the control group.
Moreover, the measured tumour volumes revealed
similar results. The tumour volumes were lower in
the BICC group than in the BIC group, but they did
not reach statistical significance. The tumour volumes
were lower in the BIC and BICC groups than those in
the control group (P < 0.001), as determined using the
repeated measures mixed model analysis. The results
are similar to those of clinical randomised trials. The
first-line use of the antiangiogenetic agent bevacizumab
showed no improvement of the overall survival in
patients with newly diagnosed GBM. Progressionfree survival rate was increased but did not reach the
expected improvement target [35].
The proliferative index is a potent biological marker
for quantitatively estimating the growth of neoplasms, thus
aiding in the identification of the prognosis of patients with
neoplasms. The Ki-67 labelling index is one of the most
effective methods for estimating the proliferative index of
the CNS [40, 41]. A case-specific growth period of a GBM
was recently suggested; the period was shorter and longer
in tumours with high and low cell proliferation indices,
respectively [42]. GBM and anaplastic astrocytoma
occur from astroglial cells, and GFAP is the most widely
used marker of astroglial cells. Malignant astrocytic
tumours are GFAP negative, and numerous high-grade
gliomas appear to have lower GFAP expression [43, 44].
Similarly, a steady transfection of rat astrocytoma C6 cells
with GFAP cDNA suppressed the cells proliferation and
extended the cellular processes [45]. In our study, H & E
staining revealed that the central necrotic and tumour areas
gradually increased and decreased in the BIC and BICC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

groups, respectively, after the implantation of nanofibrous
membranes. The GFAP expression and Ki-67 labelling
index demonstrated the most severe malignancy in the
control group, followed by the BIC group, and the least
severe malignancy in the BICC group.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of drug-loaded PLGA nanofibrous
membrane
Poly(lactid-co-glycolide) polymers, Resomer® RG
503 (lactid:glycolide, 50:50) and RG 756 (lactid:glycolide,
75:25), were commercially obtained from Bochringer
Ingelheim, Germany. Cisplatin, bis-chloroethylnitrosourea
(BCNU; carmustin), irinotecan, and combretastatin were
purchased from Sigma (Steinheim, Germany).
The electrospinning process, an electrostatic
fibre fabrication technique that has attracted increasing
interest in recent years because of its versatility and
potential for applications in diverse fields, was used for
producing drug-loaded nanofibrous membranes [46]. The
electrospinning setup included a high DC voltage power
supply, a syringe pump and needle (internal diameter,
0.42 mm), a ground electrode, and an aluminium sheet.
To fabricate the nanofibres, 50:50 poly[(d,l)-lactide-coglycolide] (PLGA) (240 mg), BCNU (20 mg), irinotecan
(20 mg), and cisplatin (20 mg) were first dissolved in 1
mL of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP; Sigma–
Aldrich, USA), whereas 75:25 PLGA (240 mg) and
combretastin (60 mg) were dissolved in 1 mL of HFIP.
The two solutions were then delivered and sequentially
electrospun at room temperature by using a syringe
pump at a volumetric flow rate of 1.8 mL/h. The distance
between the needle tip and ground electrode and the
positive voltage applied to the polymer solutions was
12 cm and 17 kV, respectively. Moreover, the nanoscale
fibres were generated by applying a strong electric field
on the polymer solution. The electrospun nanofibres
were collected in a nonwoven form on the aluminium
sheet. The resultant nanofibrous membranes mimic
extracellular matrix components more closely than do
membranes obtained through conventional techniques.
The thickness of the spun bilayered membrane was
approximately 0.1 mm.

Surgical procedures
All animal experiments were performed in
accordance with the Taipei Medical University Animal
Care and Use Committee guidelines (LAC-2013-0172).
A total of 60 adult Wistar rats weighing 200–300 g were
included in the in vivo drug concentration experiments. All
rats were housed in standard facilities with four rats per
cage and were provided free access to water and food. The
rats were anaesthetised with intraperitoneally injected with
59912

Oncotarget

6% chloral hydrate (0.6 mL/kg body weight). Furthermore,
the rats were randomly subdivided into nine groups (3
days and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 weeks) with five to six
rats in each group. After shaving and sterilisation, a 1.5cm scalp incision was made in the postorbital region. The
scalp fascia and muscle were dissected using a scalpel, and
craniectomy (approximately 10 × 10 mm) was performed
using an electric burr (Figure 1a). After local haemostasis,
the biodegradable BCNU, irinotecan, cisplatin, and
combretastatin-loaded PLGA (BICC/PLGA) nanofibrous
membranes were placed on the surface of the rat brain
tissues after craniectomy (Figure 1b). The incision was
then closed with 3-0 nylon sutures. Furthermore, after
the rats gained consciousness, they were returned to the
housing facility. If any intraoperative brain injury or
infection (including scalp, skull bone, and brain tissue
injury and infection) was observed in the rats, then they
were excluded from the study.

was injected into the right temporal region (5 mm below
the brain surface) through the implanted catheter at a rate
of 1.0 μL/min. After tumour inoculation, the animals were
allowed to recover from anaesthesia and were given free
access to food and water.

MRI and microscopic examination
The gross wound appearances were observed daily,
and the brain MRI was regularly monitored. All MRI scans
were obtained using 7-Tesla Biospec (Bruker, Ettlingen,
Germany). Before the membrane implantation, T1- and
T2-weighted images were obtained to ensure successful
creation of the glioma models, with no epidural, subdural,
and intracerebral haemorrhage. All the rats were randomly
subdivided into three groups. In the control group, PLGA
nanofibrous membranes not embedded with drugs were
implanted onto the brain surface of tumour-bearing rats.
Furthermore, the BIC/PLGA and BICC/PLGA nanofibrous
membranes were implanted into the tumour-bearing rats in
the BIC and BICC groups, respectively.
T2-weighted images were obtained as a reference
for identifying the tumour region 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14,
18, and 22 weeks after the membrane implantation. The
tumour volume was reconstructed and calculated using
the open-source, FDA-approved Digital Imaging and
Communication in Medicine imaging software OsiriX.
Any new area of nonenhancing T2 or a fluid-attenuated
inversion recovery signal that was consistent with tumour
development was considered a progressive disease.
The therapy efficacy was evaluated using the tumours’
response to the implants as a complete response, partial
response, or no response on the basis of the confirmatory
MRIs performed after 4 or more weeks. A complete
response was defined as no tumour progression (tumour
volume always decreased with time); a partial response
was defined as a temporary decrease followed by an
increase in the tumour volume; and no response was
defined as a time-dependent increase in the tumour
volume. Furthermore, after a follow-up MRI, 1–2 rats in
each group were sacrificed, and their brain tissues were
carefully removed for pathological examination (the
rats sacrificed for the pathological examinations were
excluded from the survival estimation). The brain tissues
were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin.
Coronal sections, 6-μm thick, were prepared and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin, and their GFAP expression
and the proliferative index Ki-67 were evaluated.

Pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic agents
Therats were intraperitoneally administered
overdoses of anaesthesia (more than 1.2 mL/kg body
weight). Blood samples were collected using syringes
through cardiac puncture. Ipsilateral brain tissues (covered
with the BICC/PLGA nanofibrous membrane) were also
extirpated. Furthermore, wedge-shaped brain tissues
(dimensions, 8 × 8 mm and thickness, 8–10 mm) on the
brain surface were sliced into five different layers (layers
1–5 from the surface beneath the membrane down to the
centre of the brain, with each layer being approximately
1.5-mm thick) by using a rodent brain slicer (Zivic
Instruments, USA). Moreover, approximately 0.05 g of
brain tissue from each layer was sampled. All specimens
(blood and brain tissues of the rats) were collected after 3
days and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 weeks. The specimens
were centrifuged, and the plasma was collected and stored
at −80oC until further analysis. The drug concentrations in
the specimens were determined through high-performance
liquid chromatography.

Animal and tumour inoculation
A total of 70 male Wistar rats (age, 4 months;
weight, 125–300 g; Charles River, Wilmington, MA,
USA) were anaesthetised using an intraperitoneal
injection of chloral hydrate (0.6 mL/kg body weight). The
anaesthetic effect was monitored using both rail pinch
and corneal reflex tests. The animals were secured in a
stereotactic frame (Model SAS 64612; ASI Instruments,
Warren, MI, USA), a scalp incision in the postorbital
region exposed the cranium, and the overlying pericranium
was removed using a blunt dissection. Furthermore,
craniectomy (approximately 10 × 10 mm) was performed
using an electric burr. After adequate haemostasis, a
culture medium of 10 μL containing 106 C6 glioma cells

CONCLUSIONS
In this study, we provided a novel type of interstitial
chemotherapy and targeted therapy by using biodegradable
drug-loaded nanofibrous membranes. Compared with
the only commercially available type of interstitial
chemotherapy, the Gliadel wafer, the BICC/PLGA
nanofibrous membranes developed in this study provided
a longer therapeutic period and a multidrug agent (with
different mechanisms of the chemotherapeutic and antiangiogenic agents) for enhancing therapeutic efficacy and
preventing resistance. Moreover, the nanofibres facilitated
the penetration of the agents into the BBB and achieved
high drug concentrations in the targeted treatment areas
(brain tissues). The nanofibrous membranes were not
administered through intravenous infusion, thus reducing
the systemic toxicity. Furthermore, the experimental
results (decreased malignancy, retarded tumour growth,
and prolonged survival period in tumour-bearing rats)
revealed the efficacy of the BICC/PLGA nanofibrous
membranes. Treating GBM by using a single type of
therapy may not be effective; therefore, the present study
offered a potential treatment regimen for GBM.
