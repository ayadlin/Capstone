BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have shown a statistically significant disease-free survival benefit of oxaliplatin-based
or irinotecan-based combination regimens for stage IV colon cancer. Less is known regarding the comparative
effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these agents among elderly patients. Whether the benefits of these agents
justify the additional costs for elderly Medicare recipients is particularly policy relevant after US health care reform.
METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based combination therapy versus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone in elderly stage IV colon cancer patients was performed from a US Medicare perspective.
Survival and direct medical costs were estimated using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data
sets for patients diagnosed from 2002 to 2005 with follow-up through 2007. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
(ICERs) were calculated as costs per life-year gained, with sensitivity analysis estimating the cost per quality-adjusted
life-year (QALY). RESULTS: Median improved overall survival with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone, or irinotecan-based
or oxaliplatin-based combination therapy was 0.99, 1.07, and 1.47 life-years, respectively. Costs per life-year gained
for oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based combination regimens compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone were
$78,181 and $267,938, respectively. ICERs comparing oxaliplatin-based to irinotecan-based regimens were $40,230
per life-year gained or $160,920 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based combination therapy improves overall survival but also substantially increases direct medical costs compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone when used in elderly US patients with stage IV colon cancer. Oxaliplatin-based regimens are more costeffective than irinotecan-based regimens for treatment of elderly stage IV colon cancer patients in terms of cost per

INTRODUCTION
Introduced in the 1950s, 5-fluorouracil was the first drug available for the treatment of metastatic colon cancer,
although the overall survival (OS) benefit was quite small.1 Despite biomodulation with leucovorin, the OS benefit of 5fluorouracil/leucovorin alone remained at approximately 1 year.2,3 For many years, there were no other US Food and
Drug Administration-approved chemotherapy treatments for advanced colon cancer until 1996, when irinotecan entered
the market.

A multicenter clinical trial demonstrated that irinotecan, when added to the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone
regimen, was associated with prolonged survival (17.4 vs
14.1 months; P ¼ .031), better response rate (35% vs
22%; P ¼ .005), and prolonged time to progression
(TTP; 6.7 vs 4.4 months; P<.001) when compared with
5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone.4 The efficacy of oxaliplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin has
also been demonstrated in clinical trials. In first-line treatment, a phase 3 clinical trial confirmed significant superiority of oxaliplatin þ 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin over 5fluorouracil/leucovorin alone in terms of response rate
(50% vs 22%; P ¼ .0001) and progression-free survival
(PFS; 8.2 vs 6.0 months; P ¼ .0003).5 A significantly
higher response rate and superior PFS of the combination
of chronomodulated 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin to the 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin regimen alone
were also found in Giacchetti et al.’s phase 3 clinical trial.6
The efficacy of both irinotecan-based and oxaliplatinbased regimens in stage IV colon cancer controlled clinical
trials provides the rigorous evidence required for regulatory approval. The trials do not, however, provide evidence of the effectiveness of these new agents in real world
settings. Patients, prescribers, and payers increasingly
desire both effectiveness and comparative effectiveness
data in addition to efficacy data.
Moreover, the introduction of these new and expensive chemotherapy agents has raised significant concern
regarding their consumption of health care resources.7
The total cost for the management of colon cancer in
2000 was $7.49 billion and expected to increase to $14.03
billion by 2020 in the United States.8 The marginal value
of the clinical benefit of these new chemotherapeutic
agents, especially in under-represented elderly patients, is
therefore particularly policy relevant. Within changing
health policy environments, government payers such as
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are re-evaluating drug reimbursement policies, with cost-curbing as
the objective. Within this context, population-based
information on the cost-effectiveness of oxaliplatin or irinotecan will be helpful in optimal allocation of health care
resources for management of colon cancer. Together,
these concerns highlight a need of empirical studies to
examine the clinical and economic impact of these new
chemotherapeutic agents on the treatment of advanced
colon cancer in the elderly population in the real world
setting. To the best of our knowledge, no empirical
studies have explicitly evaluated the cost-effectiveness
between the addition of oxaliplatin or irinotecan versus

3174

5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone among elderly stage IV
colon cancer patients.
By using the 1997 to 2007 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, we conducted a comparative effectiveness analysis and costeffectiveness analysis of oxaliplatin-based or irinotecanbased regimens versus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone in
patients aged 66 or older with stage IV colon cancer from
a US Medicare health care payer perspective.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source
The SEER database provides information on tumor
histology, location, stage of disease, and individual
demographics, as well as primary surgical and radiation
treatment and survival data for cancers occurring in a representative sample (approximately 14% during the period
of our study) of the US population. The Medicare database, maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, complements the SEER data with extensive
diagnosis, treatment, and payment information.
Study Population
Our study included incident cases of stage IV colon cancer
patients aged 66 years and older between 2002 and 2005,
with follow-up until December 31, 2007. SEER reports
disease stage using American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual third edition definitions
for the 2002 to 2003 cases and AJCC Cancer Staging Manual sixth edition definitions for the 2004 to 2005 cases.
Inclusion criteria required that patients have continuous
Medicare Part A and B enrollment without health maintenance organization enrollment during the 12 months
before diagnosis. We also restricted study eligibility to
patients with adenocarcinoma who were actively followed.
Chemotherapy receipt was captured in claims with
the Healthcare Common Procedures Coding System
or National Drug Code numbers for specific agent.
Chemotherapy regimens were defined based on the
administration of chemotherapy agents within the 5
weeks after initiating chemotherapy. Patients were categorized as recipients of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone, irinotecan-based regimens, or oxaliplatin-based regimens.
The definition of treatments received was based on an
intention-to-treat analysis principle—an analysis based on
the initial treatment intention. This principle is also
widely adopted by most randomized controlled trials to
provide unbiased assessment of drug effects.

Effectiveness Assessment
The clinical effectiveness measurement is survival. The
median survival time among patients who received 5fluorouracil/leucovorin alone, irinotecan-based regimens,
and oxaliplatin-based regimens were calculated from the
initiation of chemotherapy to date of death or censoring.
Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare
adjusted OS, colon cancer-specific survival, and noncolon
cancer survival rates between irinotecan-based regimens
or oxaliplatin-based regimens relative to 5-fluorouracil/
leucovorin alone. Two separate survival models were used
to analyze the effect of age (66-74 and 75 years old) on
the survival benefits of oxaliplatin-based regimens versus
irinotecan-based regimens. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained for all survival
models.
All survival models adjusted for patient demographic factors, clinical variables, colon cancer-related variables, and an indicator for whether the patient was
treated at a teaching hospital. Patient demographic factors
included age, sex, race, marital status, and urban residence. Clinical variables included the Charlson comorbidity index and a proxy for performance status. The
performance status proxy incorporated claims-based indicators for services commonly needed by patients with
poor functional status based on previous studies.9,10
These services, including hospitalization, oxygen use, and
claims for walking aids, wheelchairs, and related equipment, were identified in the Medicare claims database during the 6 months before diagnosis. Colon cancer-related
variables include tumor grade (well or moderately differentiated vs poorly or undifferentiated), number of positive
lymph nodes (N2 vs N1), adjuvant radiation therapy after
resection surgery, and use of other chemotherapy agents/
monoclonal antibodies. The indicator for whether patients
received their cancer treatment in a teaching hospital was
based on hospital/provider variables in the SEER-Medicare
data sets. SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used for
all statistical analyses.
Costs (Payments by Medicare)
The cost and cost-effectiveness were conducted from a US
Medicare system perspective, but were limited to direct
medical cost only.11 Medicare costs of colon cancer treatment based on Medicare reimbursements, including drug
costs covered under Medicare Part B, hospitalization costs
and physician fees, were calculated for all payments starting with the receipt of patients’ initial chemotherapy regimens and continued until death or censoring.

Cost-Effectiveness and Sensitivity Analysis
The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was
calculated as the additional cost per additional life-year
gained based on the difference in median survival time
between the regimens. ICERs were calculated for oxaliplatin-based regimens compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin
alone and irinotecan-based regimens versus 5-fluorouracil/
leucovorin alone. In addition, the ICER for oxaliplatinbased versus irinotecan-based regimens was calculated
as well.
A bootstrapping approach was applied to construct
confidence intervals around the ICER estimate (cost per
life-year gained).12 A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve
was also estimated based on the scatter diagram of ICERs
from the bootstrap. A cost-effectiveness acceptability
curve shows the probability that an intervention is costeffective compared with the alternative, given the
observed data, for a range of maximum monetary values
that a decision maker might be willing to pay for a particular unit change in outcome.13 Therefore, it was used in
our study to summarize information on uncertainty in
cost-effectiveness for the oxaliplatin-based and irinotecanbased regimen arms versus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin
alone and for direct comparison between oxaliplatin versus irinotecan-based regimens.
An analysis estimating the cost per quality-adjusted
life-year (QALY) gained was also performed. Because
there are no QALY data available in the SEER-Medicare
data sets, we obtained our utility estimates from the article, ‘‘Utility Valuations for Outcome States of Colorectal
Cancer.’’14 The utility values for stage IV colorectal cancer
patients were in the range of 0.20 to 0.31. We selected the
mean of 0.25 for the QALY weight to adjust life-years
gained to QALYs. After applying the utility weight, we
estimated the QALY and cost per QALY gained for comparison to the cost per life-year gained.

RESULTS
On the basis of our inclusion/exclusion criteria, we identified 2049 stage IV colon cancer patients from 2002 to 2005.
Of these patients, 49% (n ¼ 998) received 5-fluorouracil/
leucovorin alone, 25% (n ¼ 507) received irinotecan, and
26% (n ¼ 544) received oxaliplatin. Among patients who
received 1 of the 2 newer chemotherapy regimens, approximately 2=3 were younger than 75 years (60% for irinotecan
and 58% for oxaliplatin). Patients who received irinotecan
(63%) and oxaliplatin (64%) were more likely than patients
who received 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone (53%) to be

patients who received oxaliplatin had lower all-cause mortality (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54-0.78; P < .001) and colon
cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.39-0.68;
P < .001) compared with those receiving irinotecan.

The OS benefit of oxaliplatin versus irinotecan was statistically significant among patients younger than 75 years
(HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85; P ¼ .001) and patients
older than 75 years (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46-0.82;
P ¼ .001). In terms of cancer-specific survival benefit, the
superiority of oxaliplatin versus irinotecan was consistent
in patients younger than 75 years (HR, 0.50; 95% CI,
0.34-0.74; P < .001) and patients aged 75 years and older
(HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32-0.77; P ¼ .002; Table 3).
Compared with patients who received 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone, those who received irinotecan or oxaliplatin had higher medical cost (median [standard
deviation]: irinotecan-based regimen, $44,087 [$26,522];
oxaliplatin-based regimen, $60,179 [$30,600]; 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone: $22,652 [$21,508]). The
incremental cost per life-year gained with an irinotecanbased or oxaliplatin-based regimen compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone was $267,938 (95% CI,
$187,923-$307,922) and $78,181 (95% CI, $70,387$82,289), respectively. When compared with an irinotecan-based regimen, the incremental cost-effectiveness
ratio of an oxaliplatin-based regimen was $40,230 (95%
CI, $38,490-$48,168) per life-year gained (Table 4). Given
a maximum acceptable ceiling ratio of $50,000 per lifeyear gained, the probability that an oxaliplatin-based regimen is cost-effective compared with an irinotecan-based

3178

regimen is .480. If the maximum acceptable ceiling ratio
increases to $100,000 per life-year gained, the probability
that an oxaliplatin-based regimen is cost-effective compared with an irinotecan-based regimen is .990 (Fig. 1).
Because many decision makers view QALY data as
important for evaluating clinical outcomes in metastatic
cancer patients, we performed a sensitivity analysis by
incorporating a utility estimate from the colon cancer literature.14 Because the QALY values were extremely low,
the ICERs increased to a very high value as compared
with the ICER based on life-years gained (ie, oxaliplatin
vs irinotecan: $40,230 per life-year gained vs $160,920
per QALY gained; Table 5).

DISCUSSION
This population-based study expands upon findings from
clinical trials of stage IV colon cancer patients and documents survival benefits associated with irinotecan-based
or oxaliplatin-based regimens compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone in routine clinical practice. Our study
provides further insights into survival benefits of irinotecan-based or oxaliplatin-based regimens in a real world
elderly population. Furthermore, this study may be
the first comparative effectiveness research study of
oxaliplatin-based versus irinotecan-based regimens and

a US Medicare perspective.
The oxaliplatin-based and irinotecan-based regimens in our study also include those with 5-fluorouracil/
leucovorin and thus provide incremental survival benefit
from these 2 agents over 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone.
The survival benefits reported in this study for the

oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based regimens are slightly
different from those reported from clinical trials. Results
from a meta-analysis of clinical trials showed statistically
significant improvements in survival with the addition of
irinotecan to 5-fluorouracil–based regimens (HR, 0.88;
95% CI, 0.82-0.94) and the addition of oxaliplatin to
5-fluorouracil–based regimens (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.630.98 ).3 Among patients younger than 75 years, we found
larger reductions in the hazard of all-cause mortality. Specifically, our results suggest that the hazards of all-cause
death were reduced by 20% and 39% for patients who
received irinotecan-based (irinotecan: HR, 0.80; 95% CI,
0.69-0.92; P < .001) or oxaliplatin-based regimens (oxaliplatin: HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.51-0.72; P < .001), respectively, compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone.
Our population-based database enables a more
detailed appraisal of outcomes in different age groups,
especially among those who are less likely to benefit from
chemotherapy. Among patients older than 75 years, we
found that receipt of oxaliplatin but not irinotecan was
associated with improved OS (oxaliplatin: HR, 0.62;
95% CI, 0.51-0.74; P < .001). Our results on cancerspecific death reinforce the survival results, because they
show a similar effectiveness for the oxaliplatin-based and

irinotecan-based regimens (oxaliplatin: HR, 0.54; 95%
CI, 0.40-0.73; P < .001; irinotecan: HR, 1.05; 95% CI,
0.86-1.29; P ¼ .645) compared with 5-fluorouracil/
leucovorin alone. The additional survival benefit of
oxaliplatin over irinotecan in all age groups was further
confirmed in our study (OS: HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.540.78; P < .001).
Our study is not the first to demonstrate improved
survival for patients who received an oxaliplatin-based
regimen compared with an irinotecan-based regimen.
Results of North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial
N974115 have indicated that a combination of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin has superior survival
benefits in comparison with irinotecan plus bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin. An update of OS and TTP from
N9741 after a median of 5 years of follow-up16 further
supports previous findings that a combination of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin is superior to irinotecan plus bolus 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin, results in a 2.8month improvement in TTP, and results in a 5.6-month
improvement in OS.
In addition to cost-effectiveness ratio results relating
to median survival among Medicare patients using 3 different treatment regimens, we examined Medicare reimbursement amounts to address the cost-effectiveness of
different regimens for stage IV colon cancer. Compared
with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone, oxaliplatin-based
regimens can be considered cost-effective as the initial
treatment after balancing the costs and survival benefits of
each chemotherapy. The ICER of oxaliplatin-based regimens in our study ($78,181) is comparable to an estimate
from a Markov model, which suggested that treatment
including new chemotherapeutic agents (oxaliplatin or
irinotecan) increased survival at an ICER of $100,000 per
discounted life-year.17 When compared with irinotecanbased regimens, oxaliplatin-based regimens still show
superiority in cost-effectiveness of treatment of stage IV
colon cancer. After applying the QALY estimates, the ICER
for oxaliplatin versus irinotecan was $160,920 per QALY
gained, which is higher than the widely quoted $50,000 per
QALY benchmark value. However, many have argued that
this benchmark value is unrealistically low.18-20
During our study period, irinotecan was available
solely as a branded chemotherapy regimen. However, with
the loss of patent for irinotecan, the cost-effectiveness of
these regimens will likely change, given the significant cost
savings associated with generic medications. We present
results based on a sensitivity analysis with various reductions (Table 5) in the total cost of treatment associated

3180

with the irinotecan-based regimen to determine the
potential impact on the ICER after reductions in the total
treatment costs associated with a generic irinotecan-based
regimen. It is worth noting that a lower price for generic
irinotecan might impact patient adherence and other costs
of care and, therefore, the relative cost-effectiveness of irinotecan. As shown in Table 5, total costs associated with an
irinotecan regimen would need to decrease by 30.5% and
54.2%, respectively, for irinotecan to appear cost-effective
compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone and oxaliplatin-based regimens at a $100,000 per life-year gained
threshold, but not at a $100,000 per QALY threshold.
The wide confidence intervals surrounding the costeffectiveness of each chemotherapy regimen suggest that
the variety of patient demographics and clinical factors
may highly influence the expected survival years, cost, and
ICERs. Health care systems and physicians aiming to treat
stage IV colon cancer with the most cost-effective
approach should pay particular attention to patient-specific characteristics when making decisions.
There are several limitations to our analyses, many
of which are related to the use of claims data to measure
treatments. Patients’ chemotherapy regimens were categorized on observed claims within 5 weeks of initiating
chemotherapy, and the data do not contain details regarding the clinical rationale behind the choices of chemotherapy regimens. As a result, we cannot address treatment
selection bias. Furthermore, we may miscategorize
patients if prescribing physicians intended to use a different regimen as first-line treatment than what was prescribed during the first 5 weeks. In clinical practice, many
stage IV colon cancer patients progress beyond first-line
treatment and their survival and costs, and therefore the
estimated ICERs, would be impacted by second-line
treatments. In addition, monoclonal antibody use may
confound ICER estimates, because monoclonal antibody
use is not comparable across all groups (it is statistically
significantly higher in oxaliplatin-based and irinotecanbased regimens compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin
alone). To address this concern, we included a control
variable measuring monoclonal use in our multivariate
analysis. This would impact the estimated cost-effectiveness of comparator first-line regimens. In addition,
because our data reflect real world practice, the regimens
for oxaliplatin or irinotecan could differ across patients.
Another limitation is that we do not observe treatments or
health services that are not reimbursed by Medicare.
These unobserved treatments, especially among patients
who are enrolled in clinical trials, may impact the results.

SEER also has limitations. The major limitation is that
the coverage of SEER is limited to about 26% of the total
US population. Minority racial/ethnic groups and foreign-born and urban populations are of special interest to
the SEER program and are therefore somewhat over-represented in the database. We measure the difference in life
expectancy without adjusting for health-related quality of
life. Although QALYs may be more relevant for patient
decision making, we did not have utility estimates to allow
us to calculate QALYs for these patients.
This real world comparative effectiveness research
extends randomized controlled trial results by documenting the relative survival benefit of oxaliplatin-based and
irinotecan-based regimens in elderly stage IV colon cancer
patients. On the basis of median survival time, oxaliplatin-based regimens provide 5.8 additional months of life
compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone, whereas
irinotecan-based regimens provide 1.0 additional months
compared with 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin alone. We conclude that oxaliplatin-based regimens are more likely to be
cost-effective than irinotecan-based regimens if life-years
gained are the primary endpoint considered in treatment
of elderly US patients with stage IV cancer based on analysis of patient-level SEER-Medicare data.
