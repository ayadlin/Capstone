Abstract
Nutlin-3, an MDM2 inhibitor, activates p53, resulting in several
types of cancer cells undergoing apoptosis. Although p53 is
mutated or deleted in f50% of all cancers, p53 is still
functionally active in the other 50%. Consequently, nutlin-3
and similar drugs could be candidates for neoadjuvant therapy
in cancers with a functional p53. Cellular senescence is also a
phenotype induced by p53 activation and plays a critical role in
protecting against tumor development. In this report, we found
that nutlin-3a can induce senescence in normal human
fibroblasts. Nutlin-3a activated and repressed a large number
of p53-dependent genes, including those encoding microRNAs.
mir-34a, mir-34b, and mir-34c, which have recently been shown
to be downstream effectors of p53-mediated senescence, were
up-regulated, and inhibitor of growth 2 (ING2) expression was
suppressed by nutlin-3a treatment. Two candidates for a
p53-DNA binding consensus sequence were found in the ING2
promoter regulatory region; thus, we performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays
and confirmed p53 binding directly to those sites. In addition,
the luciferase activity of a construct containing the ING2
regulatory region was repressed after p53 activation. Antisense
knockdown of ING2 induces p53-independent senescence,
whereas overexpression of ING2 induces p53-dependent senescence. Taken together, we conclude that nutlin-3a induces
senescence through p53 activation in normal human fibroblasts, and p53-mediated mir34a, mir34b, and mir34c upregulation and ING2 down-regulation may be involved in the
senescence pathway. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3193–203]

Introduction
p53 has many functions in its role as a tumor suppressor gene
(1). It is well-documented that p53 is a critical mediator of the
senescence response to several stimuli, such as DNA damage,
oncogene activation, oxidative stress, and overexpression of tumor
suppressor genes (2, 3). Cellular senescence is mainly classified into
two types based on the mechanism. One is replicative senescence,
which is involved with telomere-shortening and found in human

fibroblast strains (4). The other is telomere-independent cellular
senescence, called premature senescence and is induced by cellular
stress. p53 plays a pivotal role for both types of cellular senescence.
Recent reports show that the senescence response by p53
activation is considered to be one of the mechanisms protecting
against malignant transformation (5, 6).
Under normal physiologic conditions, p53 expression is maintained at low levels in proliferating cells by degradation via MDM2
functioning as an E3 ubiquitin ligase (7). MDM2 is overexpressed in
several human cancers, especially in sarcomas (8). ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) functions in part to activate p53 through MDM2
inhibition (9, 10). Because MDM2 inhibition could be effective for
p53 stabilization and accumulation, several MDM2 inhibitors have
been recently developed for potential cancer therapy (11). Nutlin-3,
which is one of the MDM2 inhibitors, is a small molecule that binds
to MDM2 so that it functions as an activator of p53 expression due
to the interference of binding between p53 and MDM2 (11–13).
Recent reports have shown that nutlin-3 induces p53-dependent
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in several kinds of cancer cell lines
that contain wild-type p53 (14, 15). The effect was especially
dramatic in cancer cells that overexpress MDM2, such as certain
sarcomas. Although phosphorylation of various serine resides on
p53 NH2 terminal domain was not detected after nutlin-3
treatment, p53 seems to be fully active as a transcription factor
and apoptotic inducer (16). Moreover, nutlin-3 also prevented the
association of MDM2 with both hypoxia-inducible factor 1a, so
that the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor was
attenuated (17), and E2F1, which allowed transcriptional activation
of p73a and NOXA resulting in apoptosis (18). Nutlin-3 has the
potential to perform various functions through MDM2 inhibition.
In the present study, our initial aim was to investigate if nutlin-3
induced senescence in normal human fibroblasts.
When p53 is activated by several stimuli, many genes are
regulated positively and negatively. Previous reports have examined
changes in p53-related genes after different treatments that activate
p53 (19–21). Although p53 induces cellular senescence, the mRNA
expression pattern exhibited some differences between replicative
senescence and premature senescence (22, 23). In addition to p53related mRNA expression, recent reports have shown that microRNA-34s (mir-34a, mir-34b, and mir-34c) are downstream effectors
of p53-dependent senescent and apoptotic pathways (24–27).
In this study, we further focused on the inhibitor of growth 2
(ING2) gene, a potential nutlin-3–induced p53-responsive gene,
which was down-regulated by the treatment of nutlin-3 in the
microarray experiments. ING2 is a member of the ING gene family,
which contains a plant homeodomain finger (28). ING2 may be a
tumor suppressor gene associated with p53 (29). Recent reports have

shown that ING2 forms complexes with mSin3a and histone
deacetylase 1 (HDAC1; ref. 30) and binds to the histone H3
trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3; refs. 31–33). This evidence
indicates that ING2 is involved in chromatin remodeling to regulate
gene activation or suppression. Specifically, it has been reported that
H3K4me3 is associated with gene activation (34, 35). Chromatin
structure consists of many forms of modification that regulate gene
transcription; thus, the impairment of these epigenetic events may
affect tumor development, cell proliferation, and senescence (36).

Drug treatment and senescence-associated B-galactosidase assays.
Nutlin-3a and its enantiomer, nutlin-3b, were generous gifts from
Dr. Lyubomir Vassilev (Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc.). Cells were plated at
varying cell densities in either six-well dishes or 100 mm2 dishes. Nutlin-3a
or nutlin-3b was added at varying concentrations (0–10 Amol/L) after 24 h.
Cells were then fixed in 2% formaldehyde/0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for
5 min and incubated at 37jC for 12 to 18 h with fresh senescence-associated
h-galactosidase (SA-h-gal) stain solution containing 1.0 mg/mL X-gal (37).
Doxorubicin and trichostatin A (Sigma-Aldrich) were used at the indicated
concentrations.
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Protein lysates were
prepared as described previously (19). p53 immunoprecipitation was done
by incubating with agarose-conjugated DO-1 and Pab 1801 (Santa Cruz)
antibodies for 2 h. Proteins were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels and
transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Protein detection was
done by using the following antibodies: p53 (DO-1; Oncogene Science), ser15
p53 and ac382 p53 (Cell Signaling), threonine 18 p53 (gift from Dr. Ettore
Appella), p21 (Oncogene Science), h-actin (Sigma), and rabbit polyclonal
anti-ING2, which was generated against the COOH terminal 14mer amino
acid of ING2. Bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and
visualized by autoradiography.
Microarray analysis. Microarray experiments were performed as
previously described (19). Samples for the microarray experiments were
prepared as follows: both NHF-hTERT and NHF-hTERT p53 shRNA cells
were treated with 10 Amol/L nutlin-3a or the same amount of DMSO. Cells
were harvested at 24 and 36 h after the treatment. The data analysis was
performed using the BRB Array Tools.6
Real-time reverse transcription–PCR analysis of microRNA and
mRNA expression. Total RNA from each cell line was harvested using
TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For detecting

microRNA expression, reverse reactions were performed using TaqMan
MicroRNA Assay kit (Applied Biosystems). Five micrograms of total RNA
were used for the synthesis of first-strand cDNA using the SuperScript III
First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Real-time PCR analysis was performed using ABI prism
7500 (Applied Biosystems) with a TaqMan probe provided by the
manufacturer. The TaqMan probes used were ING2 (Id Hs00357543_m1),
p21 (Id Hs00355782_m1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH; Id Hs99999905_m1), hsa-mir-34a, hsa-mir-34b, hsa-mir-34c, and
RNU66. The relative amounts of the mRNA and microRNA targeted gene
were normalized by the amount of GAPDH and RNU66 transcript,
respectively.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) was performed using the ChIP Assay kit (Upstate) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. PCR reactions contained 4 AL of immunoprecipitate or diluted total input, 500 nmol/L of each primer, 200 nmol/L
deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 500 nmol/L MgSO4, and 1 unit KOD plus
(Toyobo) in a total volume of 50 AL. The primers for detecting the expected
p53 DNA binding sequence were designed as follows: ING2 site 1, forward
5¶-AGATTCCAGCGTAGGGGAAG-3¶ and reverse 5¶-CTTTTCGGACGACCTGGAG-3¶; ING2 site 2, forward 5¶-AGGCTAGCGGGAGGCTCT-3¶ and reverse
5¶-CTCCAGGACCGGAGCAGT-3¶. After 32 to 35 cycles of amplification, PCR
products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and analyzed by ethidium bromide
staining.
Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. Electrophoretic mobility shift
assays (EMSA) were carried out using the LightShift Chemiluminescent
EMSA kit (Pierce). The oligonucleotide with the p53 binding site, from 890
to 851 of the ING2 promoter, called ING2 site 1, was 5¶-TCCCTGATCATCAGCCCCGCGGTGCCGGGCGAGCCCGAGGGC-3. Another oligonucleotide
with the p53 binding site of the ING2 promoter ( from 268 to 229),
named ING2 site 2, was 5¶-GACTGGGGACAGGCGGGCGGCGACGGGCTTGTCATGGGGA-3. All oligonucleotides were hybridized with complementarysynthesized oligonucleotides and used in double-stranded form. The
oligonucleotides were labeled with biotin. The DNA binding reaction of
biotinated double-stranded oligonucleotides with 10 ng of recombinant

p53 (active motif) was done at room temperature for 20 min according to
the manufacturer’s protocol in 1 binding buffer, containing 2.5% glycerol,
5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.05% NP40, and 50 ng/AL poly(deoxyadenylatedeoxyTMP). Anti-p53 (DO-1) antibody and anti-Sp1 antibody
(Santa Cruz) were used for detecting a super-shifted band. Unlabeled
oligonucleotides were used as competitors. DNA-protein complexes were
detected by the ECL method.
Luciferase assay. The reporter construct for ING2(A) containing
1251 to +140 bases from the putative transcription start site and
ING2(C) containing 413 to +140 bases from the putative transcription
start site were prepared by PCR amplification from the human genomic
DNA of Beas2B, a normal human lung epithelial cell line. The products
were cloned into the MluI and BglII sites of the pGL-3 basic vector
(Promega). The construct for ING2(B) was generated from the ING2(A)
by digesting the region from 560 to 162 using smaI. The construct for
ING2(D) containing 162 to +140 bases was further modified from the
ING2(B).
A dual-luciferase assay was performed in triplicate according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Promega). 1  105 cells were plated on 12-well
plates 1 d before transfection. A pGL-3 luciferase reporter (1.6 Ag) and 0.16
Ag of the Renilla luciferase assay vector pRL (Promega) were cotransfected
into HCT116 and RKO cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. At 24 h posttransfection, the
cells were treated with nutlin-3a or were left untreated. Cell lysates were
obtained by adding 250 AL of cell lysis buffer per well. Luciferase activity
was measured by using 20 AL of cell lysate per assay tube in a single-photon
channel of a scintillation counter (Beckman). The level of firefly luciferase
activity was normalized by that of the Renilla luciferase activity in each
experiment.
Small interfering RNA, overexpression, and antisense experiments.
The ING-2 small interfering RNAs (siRNA; Invitrogen) were designed as
follows: ING2-1, 5-ACACAAAUGCUCGAAUUGGUGGAAA-3¶ and ING2-2,
5¶-ACAUACUGCUUAUGCAACCAAGUGU-3¶. The scrambled siRNA sequences were 5-ACAAAGUUCGCAAUUGGGUGACAAA-3. These were transfected into the NHF-hTERT cells using the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For Western
blotting, cells were treated 24 h with nutlin-3a, nutlin-3b, or no treatment
at 72 h posttransfection. For the SA-h-gal assay, cells were treated with the
nutlins or left untreated for 3 d at 24 h posttransfection. The ING2
complete cDNA expression vector was transferred into an adenoviruspacking cell line. The high-titer purified preparations were generated by
Gene Expression Laboratory of National Cancer Institute-Frederick. GFP
gene expression in IMR-90, MRC-5, and WI-38 cells treated with the GFP
inserted adenovirus (adeno-GFP) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
100 was observed in f90% of the cells. The cells were treated with 100
MOI adeno-GFP or ING2 inserted adenovirus (adeno-ING2) for 72 h.
MSCV retroviral vectors encoded for mir-34a were kindly provided by
Dr. Gregory L. Hannon (Watson School of Biological Sciences, Cold Spring
Harbor Laboratory).

Results
Nutlin-3a induced cellular senescence in normal human
fibroblasts. The normal human skin fibroblast strain GM08402
and the hTERT immortalized cell line NHF-hTERT were treated

with nutlin-3a for 7 days. Nutlin-3b, which has a 150-fold lower
affinity to MDM2 (13), was used as a negative control. After the
treatment, the cells were fixed and stained for the low pH SA-h-gal
activity (Fig. 1A). A high percentage of cells that had been treated
with nutlin-3a were stained positive for the low pH h-gal,
indicating cells had undergone senescence. Nutlin-3b–treated cells
exhibited similar levels as the nontreated cells. Next, we
determined the time and dose dependency of nutlin-3 in NHFhTERT cells. In the time course, 50% of the cells were SA-h-gal
positive at 3 days and almost 100% showed positive staining at
7 days after nutlin-3a treatment, whereas few positive cells were
detected by treatment with nutlin-3b (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Cells were also treated with indicated concentrations of nutlin-3
for 7 days. Ninety percent of the cells were stained with SA-h-gal at
3 Amol/L nutlin-3a, whereas 1 Amol/L nutlin-3a showed a weak
effect. All of the cells showed positive staining at 10 Amol/L, the
reported maximal dose without toxicity (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
We further examined the effect of nutlin-3 treatment for other
normal human lung fibroblast strains, IMR-90, MRC-5, and
GM08402, and analyzed the number of positive cells by SA-h-gal
staining. All three cell strains showed a morphologically senescent
phenotype after nutlin-3a treatment. Again, almost 100% of the
cells showed positive staining (Fig. 1B). There is a low percentage
of h-gal–positive cells after nutlin-3b treatment; however, it was
not a significant change compared with the untreated cells.
The hallmark of cellular senescence is an essentially irreversible
arrest of cell division. To determine if the nutlin-induced
senescence was reversible, colony-forming efficiencies (CFE) and
population doublings (PD) were determined for cells after removal
of the nutlin drugs. CFEs were determined by allowing the cells to
be grown in the presence of 10 Amol/L nutlin-3a or nutlin-3b or left
untreated for 7 days at subconfluence. Cells were then trypsinized,
washed, and replated at densities of either 1  102 or 1  103 per
100 mm2 dish in normal growth media for an additional 7 days.
The cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet, and the
number of colonies was counted. At both densities, the nutlin3a–treated cells were unable to form a significant number of
colonies compared with the untreated or nutlin-3b–treated cells.
There was a 10-fold difference in the number of colonies formed
(Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Next, we calculated the PDs for these cells after the same
protocol as above, except that cells were plated at densities of
either 1  103 or 1  104 per dish. Cells were trypsinized after
7 days and counted to determine population doublings. Results
showed the nutlin-3a–treated cells could not divide after
being replated because there was <0.1 PDs for either density
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). On the other hand, the nutlin-3b or
untreated cells underwent over 2.5 PDs, depending on the number
of cells plated. Assuming that f90% of the nutlin-3a–treated cells
underwent senescence, these data support the hypothesis that

Nutlin-3a Activates p53 to Induce Senescence

these nutlin-3a–treated cells have undergone a permanent
senescence.
Nutlin-3a–induced senescence is dependent on p53. To
determine if the senescence is induced in a p53-dependent manner,

p53-deficient cell lines, NHF-hTERT E6 and NHF-hTERT p53
shRNA, were exposed to nutlin-3a or nutlin-3b for 7 days. The
parental cells, NHF-hTERT cells, exhibited the senescent phenotype
after treatment with nutlin-3a, with over 80% of the cells stained by

After the treatment, ChIP was performed
as described in Material and Methods.
B, EMSA was carried out using biotinated
oligonucleotides generated from the
candidates of p53 consensus DNA-binding
sequence on the ING2 regulatory regions,
ING site 1 and site 2. Recombinant p53
protein and anti-p53 (DO-1) antibody were
used for detecting shifted or super-shifted
bands. Each unlabeled oligonucleotide
(100-fold excess) was used as a
competitor. C, four kinds of luciferase
constructs using pGL-3 basic vector were
designed as A, B, C , and D . Each 1.6 Ag of
a pGL-3 luciferase reporter and 0.16 Ag of
Renilla luciferase assay vector pRL were
cotransfected into the p53 isogenic pairs
of HCT116 and RKO cells. At 24 h later,
10 Amol/L nutlin-3a or the same amount
of DMSO was added to cells for 12 h.
Variation in transfection efficiency was
normalized by Renilla luciferase activity.

cells were treated with the following siRNA oligonucleotides at 100 nmol/L

reduces ING2 levels by almost 50% (ING2-1), and an ING-2 siRNA which almost
completely inhibits ING2 expression (ING2-2) for 24 h. After the treatment,

SA-h-gal staining. However, we did not observe any changes in
both NHF-hTERT E6 and NHF-hTERT p53 shRNA cells when they
were treated with nutlin-3a or nutlin-3b (Fig. 1C).
To verify the accumulation of p53 by nutlin-3a, Western blot
analysis was performed. In NHF-hTERT cells, the total amount of
p53 expression was increased by nutlin-3a, but not by nutlin-3b
(Fig. 1D). Although phosphorylation was not seen on residue serine
15 of p53 in the nutlin-3a–treated cells in agreement with a
previous report (16), acetylation of p53 residue 382 was present in
the nutlin-3a–treated cells. p21 expression was also increased with
nutlin-3a treatment. In contrast, there was no increase of p53
expression with nutlin-3a treatment in the p53 null cells.
To confirm these observations, we examined p53 expression
with nutlin-3 treatment using the p53 isogenic-paired cell lines,
HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53 / cells. The result was very
similar with the previous data from studies using human
fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
According to a previous report, phosphorylation of threonine 18
is mediated by casein kinases (38), requiring the previous
phosphorylation of serine 15, and this phosphorylation interferes
with the p53 binding to MDM2 (39). Therefore, we examined the
status of threonine 18 with nutlin-3 treatment. Phosphorylation on
residue threonine 18 of p53 was not present in nutlin-3–treated
NHF-hTERT cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
It has been reported that U-2OS, an osteosarcoma cell line which
possesses a functional p53, did not exhibit the apoptotic phenotype
after nutlin-3a (14). We hypothesized that nutlin-3a could induce
senescence instead of apoptosis even in this cancer cell line. The
levels of senescence were minimal at 7 days, but there was a
significant increase seen at 14 days (Supplementary Fig. S4).
According to the literature, the subset of apoptotic-associated
genes regulated by p53 was lacking in U-2OS cells compared with
cells that were strongly induced to undergo apoptosis by nutlin-3a
treatment (14). The difference in cellular response by nutlin-3a can
be explained from the defects downstream of p53.
Nutlin-3a–induced p53-responsive genes. The spectrum of
p53-responsive genes differs depending on the types of stimuli
(19). Therefore, we next examined the contribution of p53
activation to gene expression after treatment with nutlin-3a using
microarray technology. We compared the gene expression in
NHF-hTERT and NHF-hTERT p53 shRNA cells with treatment of
nutlin-3a or DMSO at 24 and 36 h using the univariate twosample t test (P < 0.05) with randomized variance. A total of 2,942
genes were differentially expressed after nutlin-3a treatment,
of which 1,737 genes (59%) were up-regulated and 1,205 genes
(41%) were down-regulated (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Among the up-regulated genes, the expression of BTG2, GDF15,
TP53I3/PIG3, SULF2, NINJ1, PLTP, and SESN1 was strongly
increased in a p53-dependent manner (Table 1). The well-known
targets of p53, BAX, GADD45A, TP53INP1, TP53AP1, CCNG1, and
IGFBP3 were also detected as up-regulated genes. On the other
hand, the expression of CCNB1, CENPF, CCNA2, CDKN3, SPAG5,
CKS2, CASC5, KIFC1, CDC20, and KIF2C was remarkably
decreased (Table 1). Additionally, the expression of minichromosome maintenance complex component (MCM) genes, including
MCM2 to MCM8, which are associated with DNA replication, and
ING2, which is involved in chromatin remodeling and regulating
gene expression, were down-regulated in NHF-hTERT cells treated
with nutlin-3a.

Nutlin-3a Activates p53 to Induce Senescence

shown that mir-34a, mir-34b, and mir-34c are regulated by p53
activation, suggesting that they have a potential function in the
senescence pathway in normal human fibroblasts (24–27). We
found that the expression of all three mir-34s were up-regulated by
nutlin-3a treatment and that the response of mir-34a was earlier
than mir-34b and mir-34c (Fig. 2A). mir34a, mir34b, and mir34c
levels were shown to be up-regulated to varying amounts in various
human tumor cell lines that were wild type for p53 after treatment
with nutlin-3a after 24 hours (Fig. 2B–D). The tumor cell lines
that were either p53 null or have a mutant p53 did not show this
up-regulation.
We further focused on ING2 as one of the p53-responsive genes
from the microarray data because of previous studies of the ING
family (28–32). We examined the ING2 expression when p53 was
activated using nutlin-3a in NHF-hTERT cells. Interestingly, ING2
expression in the cells treated with nutlin-3a was remarkably
decreased compared with nontreated cells while ING2 expression
was not changed in nutlin-3b–treated cells (Fig. 3A).
To further show the association between p53 status and ING2
expression, we examined other cell lines. p53 wild-type cells,
including HCT116, RKO, LS174T, A549, MCF-7, and NHF-hTERT,
were treated with 10 Amol/L of nutlin-3a or DMSO as a control.
ING2 mRNA transcripts were consistently decreased by nutlin-3a
treatment in all cell lines using a real-time PCR method, whereas
ING2 mRNA expression was not changed significantly in p53
mutant and null cells (Fig. 3B).
Next, we investigated whether the expression of ING2 mRNA was
altered in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner by nutlin3a treatment. In both HCT116 and RKO cells, the ING2 mRNA level
was down-regulated, depending on the dose, reaching a maximum
level at 5 Amol/L at 24 h. Furthermore, the decrease in ING2
expression was time dependent. p21 mRNA expression was
examined as a positive control of p53 activation and was
up-regulated under the same conditions (Fig. 3C).
ING2 protein expression was examined using the p53 isogenic
cell lines, HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53 / , NHF-hTERT and
NHF-hTERT p53 shRNA, to see whether the suppression occurs in a
p53-dependent manner. The accumulation of p53 in HCT116 p53+/+
was seen earlier than in NHF-hTERT (Fig. 3D). In p53 wild-type
cells, ING2 protein expression was consistently decreased by the
treatment with nutlin-3a in a p53-dependent manner. ING2 protein
expression correlated with its mRNA expression level. There was no
remarkable change in p53 null cells.
p53 binds to the ING2 promoter region and suppresses ING2
activity. We next analyzed the ING2 promoter region for a
p53-DNA consensus binding sequence by computational analysis.7
Two regions that were strongly suspected as candidates were
detected on the ING2 regulatory region within 1.5 kb. The regions
between 885 and 857 (ING2 site 1) and 262 and 235 (ING2
site 2) contain two motifs that closely resemble the PuPuPuCA/TA/
TGPyPyPy consensus binding site for p53 (Fig. 4A).
To examine if wild-type p53 binds to the ING2 promoter,
we first performed ChIP assays. The primer pairs were
constructed to detect each sequence for ING2, site 1 and site 2.
As a positive control, the p53-DNA consensus binding sequence
on the p21 promoter region was also examined. Cells were
left untreated or treated with nutlin-3a for 24 h. Lysates were

harvested and cross-linked, and then immunoprecipitations
were performed using an antibody directed against p53. Promoter
fragments of ING2 site 1, site 2, and p21 were amplified by
PCR and a representative agarose gel of the PCR products is
shown in Fig. 4A. The PCR bands were detected at both sites 1
and 2 under treatment with nutlin-3a in p53 wild-type cells,
whereas no bands were detected in the control cells and p53 null
cells.
The EMSA was performed using biotinylated double-stranded
oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequence of ING2 sites 1
and 2. Recombinant p53 protein was used for these experiments.
The shifted bands were detected in both ING2 sites 1 and 2
(Fig. 4B). An antibody to p53 generated a super-shifted complex
for both sites 1 and 2 of ING2, further confirming that the binding
is specific. Moreover, when the unlabeled double-stranded
oligonucleotides corresponding to ING2 sites 1 and 2 were used
as competitors, the formation of complexes was inhibited in each
case, supporting the specificity of the DNA-p53 complex for these
putative sites.
To determine whether the decrease in ING2 mRNA is dependent
on the function of p53 as a regulator of transcription, we analyzed
the regulation of the ING2 promoter. For this purpose, four kinds
of constructs were generated and cloned into the pGL3 luciferase
vector. The longest construct (A) from 1251 to +140 included
both ING2 site 1 and site 2. The construct (B) lacked the site 2,
and the construct (C) had only the site 2. The construct (D) was
deleted of both sites 1 and 2 as a negative control. These
constructs were transiently cotransfected with Renilla luciferase
vector into the p53 isogenic pairs of HCT116 and RKO cell
lines. After transfection, the cells were treated with nutlin-3a for
12 hours. In p53 wild-type cells, the luciferase activity in nutlin3a–treated cells was clearly down-regulated in the constructs (A),
(B), and (C) of the ING2 promoter when compared with the
nontreated cells, whereas there was no remarkable change in
the construct (D) between nutlin-3a–treated and nontreated cells
(Fig. 4C). No significant alteration of the luciferase activity was
detected in nutlin-3a–treated and nontreated p53 deficient cells
(Fig. 4C).
Both ING2 site 1 and site 2 share similar sequences with the Sp1
consensus sequence (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Previous reports
showed Sp1 was involved in the repression mechanism by p53
(40–43). To investigate whether Sp1 can bind to these sites, EMSA
was performed using recombinant Sp1 protein. The labeled
oligonucleotides of a typical Sp1 consensus sequence were used as
a positive control. A shifted band was detected at ING2 site 2, but not
detected at site 1 (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Moreover, we examined
the binding affinity at ING2 site 2 with the competition of Sp1 and
p53. When both Sp1 and p53 were added, p53 dominantly bound to
ING2 site 2 (Supplementary Fig. S5B). It has previously been shown
that negative regulation of transcription by p53 may involve
p53-mediated recruitment of HDAC and mSin3A (44); therefore,
we tested whether this is also true for the ING2 promoter. HCT116
cells were treated with trichostatin A to inhibit HDAC activity. ING2
expression was not attenuated by a combined treatment with nutlin3a and trichostatin A (Supplementary Fig. S5C). In the luciferase
assay, the activity was not repressed by the same treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S5D).
Disregulation of ING2 induces senescence. We have previously
shown that overexpression of ING2 can induce p53-dependent
senescence (45). We have confirmed this result (Supplementary
Fig. S6). We also have shown that down-regulation of ING2 by siRNA

technology induces cellular senescence (Fig. 5A and B) that is p53
independent (Fig. 5C and D).

Discussion
We found that nutlin-3a induced senescence in normal
human fibroblasts in a time-dependent, dose-dependent, and
p53-dependent manner. A complimentary report showed that
nutlin-3a induces cellular senescence in murine fibroblasts in a
p53-dependent manner (46). Although phosphorylation was not
seen on residue serine 15 of p53 after nutlin-3a treatment,
acetylation of p53 residue 382 was detected. Previous studies
have implicated ING1 and 2 in acetylation of p53 at lysine 382
(46, 47) and acetylation of p53 K382 increases during cell
senescence (3). In addition, we examined the phosphorylation
status at threonine 18 with nutlin-3 treatment, because this
modification was previously found to be associated with MDM2
(39). Although we could not detect this p53 phosphorylation
with nutlin-3 treatment, unlike doxorubicin treatment, p53 could
still function as a transcriptional factor because p21 and mir34a, mir-34b, and mir-34c expression was increased. It has been
reported that the phosphorylation on the NH2 terminal of p53
was not required for p53-dependent transcription based on the
result that ARF-induced p53 was not phosphorylated on the NH2
terminal of p53, including serine 6, 9, 15, 20, and 37, but showed
the phosphorylation at serine 392 (48). Therefore, phosphorylation on the NH2 terminal of p53 seems not be essential for
induction of p53-dependent senescence.
Previously, we reported that p53 activation by treatment with
several stimuli regulated various genes positively and negatively
depending on the stimuli (19). To better understand the association
with nutlin-3a–induced p53 and senescence in human fibroblasts,
microarray experiments were performed. We found that the
genes up-regulated by nutlin-3a treatment were associated with
antiproliferative and proapoptotic functions. Plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1 was one of these genes and is a potential
p53 target and involved in cellular senescence (3, 49). As to the
down-regulated genes, cell cycle and DNA replication-related
genes, such as CCNB1, CCNB2, CCNA2, CKN3, and MCM family
genes, were significantly decreased.
According to recent reports, mir-34a, mir-34b, and mir-34c,
which are induced by p53 activation, are downstream effectors of
p53 (24–27). Overexpression of mir-34a, mir-34b, and mir-34c has
been shown to induce senescence in normal human fibroblasts
(24). We confirmed that all three of the mir-34s were increased in
nutlin-3a–treated NHF-hTERT cells. Whereas mir-34a, mir-34b, and
mir-34c were not induced by nutlin-3a in the p53 null or mutant
cell lines, the level of induction varied among the cancer cell lines
with wild-type p53. These data support the hypothesis that mir-34a,
mir-34b, and mir-34c are involved in the p53-dependent senescence
pathway.
We found that ING2 mRNA transcripts were suppressed
by nutlin-induced p53 activation from the microarray data.
We also detected a decrease of ING2 protein expression in
nutlin-3a–treated cells and ING2 mRNA levels were consistently
down-regulated with nutlin-3a treatment in p53 wild-type cells,
whereas there was no remarkable change in p53-mutant and
p53-deficient cells. Recently, there is evidence that a large number
of genes are suppressed by p53 (19–21). It has been reported that
p53 consensus DNA-binding sequences have been found among
genes repressed in a p53-dependent manner (20, 21). Recent
reports have indicated that some of these down-regulated genes

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

might be associated with microRNA expression. In fact, mir-34a
was determined to regulate a subset of p53 related genes (24). We
investigated whether overexpression of mir-34a could regulate
ING2 expression. ING2 expression in mir-34a overexpressed cells
was not altered (Supplementary Fig. S7).
We found candidates of p53 consensus DNA-binding sequences
on the ING2 regulatory region within 1.5 kb and confirmed the
p53 binding ability to the expected sites from ChIP assay and
EMSA. Furthermore, the data from the luciferase assays showed
p53 could repress ING2 promoter activity. There was sufficient
evidence that p53 repressed ING2 and this phenomenon might be
occurring through p53 binding directly to the consensus DNAbinding sequences on the ING2 regulatory region. At least, three
kinds of mechanisms have been proposed (51). First, p53 may
interact with DNA-binding transcriptional activators and interfering with the function of activators. This mechanism includes
the competition between p53 and activators through the
overlapping DNA binding site. Second, p53 may interact with
components of the basal transcriptional machinery. Finally, p53
may recruit chromatin modifying factors, such as HDAC, so that
gene expression could be suppressed. These three mechanisms of
p53 transcriptional repression can also act in combination (40).
Based on these previous studies, we first investigated the
possibility that other transcriptional factors could bind to the
p53 consensus DNA-binding sequences on the ING2 promoter.
Both ING2 sites 1 and 2 share similar sequences with the Sp1
consensus sequence. One of the mechanisms of ING2 suppression
by p53 could be explained that p53 binding affinity to the
promoter region was stronger than Sp1, which might regulate
ING2 expression endogenously.
Recent reports indicate that ING2 has the ability to bind the
histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (31–33). Consequently, ING2 is
involved in chromatin remodeling to regulate gene activation or
suppression. Chromatin structure consists of many forms of
modification that drastically regulate gene transcription; thus, the
impairment of these epigenetic events may affect tumor development, cell proliferation, and senescence (36). A previous report
shows ING2 suppresses cyclin D1 mRNA expression in response to
DNA damage (32). It is well known that cyclin D1 has diverse
effects on cells depending on its level of expression and cell type
(51). For example, cyclin D1 expression is increased in senescent
cells compared with young cells (52, 53). Based on this evidence,
there is the possibility that the down-regulation of ING2 results in
the enhancement of cyclin D1 to modulate senescence.
In addition to the induction of senescence by down-regulation of
ING2, overexpression of ING2 can also induce senescence. The
senescence induced by knockdown of ING2 is p53 independent,
whereas the senescence induced by overexpression of ING2 is p53
dependent. These results suggest that both different mechanisms
and the physiologic range of ING2 levels may be important to
maintain cellular homeostasis. Further studies with either ING2
transgenic or knockout mice will be interesting to pursue.
