Abstract

Author Manuscript

Progesterone (P4) has emerged as an important hormone regulating mammary stem cell
populations. In breast cancer, P4 and synthetic analogs increase the number of stem-like cells
within luminal estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive breast cancers.
These cells gain expression of de-differentiated cell markers CD44 and cytokeratin 5 (CK5), lose
luminal markers ER and PR, and are more therapy resistant. We previously described that P4downregulation of microRNA (miR)-29a contributes to the expansion of CD44high and CK5+
cells. Here we investigated P4-downregulation of miR-141, a member of the miR-200 family of
tumor suppressors, in facilitating an increase in stem-like breast cancer cells. miR-141 was the
sole member of the miR-200 family P4-downregulated at the mature miRNA level in luminal
breast cancer cell lines. Stable inhibition of miR-141 alone increased the CD44high population, and
potentiated P4-mediated increases in both CD44high and CK5+ cells. Loss of miR-141 enhanced
both mammosphere formation and tumor initiation. miR-141 directly targeted both PR and Stat5a,
transcription factors important for mammary stem cell expansion. miR-141 depletion increased PR
protein levels, even in cells lines where PR expression is estrogen-dependent. Stat5a suppression
via siRNA or a small molecule inhibitor reduced the P4-dependent increase in CK5+ and CD44high
cells. These data support a mechanism by which P4-triggered loss of miR-141 facilitates breast
cancer cell de-differentiation through deregulation of PR and Stat5a, two transcription factors
important for controlling mammary cell fate.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

A major role of progesterone (P4) in the mammary gland is to promote lobulo-alveolar
development during specific stages such as puberty, pregnancy, and lactation (1). In murine
models, this process involves the P4-dependent expansion of mammary stem cells (MaSCs)
that in turn rapidly generate additional lobular epithelial cells (2, 3). This occurs through a
paracrine mechanism whereby progesterone receptor (PR)+ cells in the luminal compartment
signal through RANKL to expand basal-located stem cells (4, 5). In humans, P4 increases
progenitor cells in recapitulated breast epithelial acini structures (6). RANKL is P4regulated in human breast (7), and thus this expansion could also occur through intercellular signaling. Expansion of pre-malignant stem cell populations may explain increased
breast cancer incidence among women taking hormone therapies containing progestin (8).
We previously demonstrated in estrogen receptor (ER)+ and PR+ breast cancer cells that P4
treatment leads to the emergence of cells expressing cytokeratin 5 (CK5) (9, 10), a marker of
stem and progenitor cells in the normal breast and breast cancer (11-13). CK5+, compared to
the bulk CK5− tumor cells, are endocrine and chemo-therapy resistant, and have enhanced
mammosphere forming potential (11, 14). Progestin exposure of existing breast cancers may
thus negatively affect tumor progression.

miRNAs are small regulatory RNA molecules that regulate expression of specific target
genes by base-pairing to their mRNAs and interfering with their translation and/or inducing
their degradation. miRNA maturation is regulated by several processing steps. The primary
miRNA transcript (pri-miRNA) is usually RNA Pol II generated and can include multiple
miRNA sequences from a cluster. The pri-miRNA is then processed to its precursor hairpin
form (pre-miRNA) by the ribonuclease III protein Drosha, exported out of the nucleus, and
cleaved into its mature form by the ribonuclease III enzyme Dicer (15). miRNA species are
in general downregulated in cancer compared to normal adult tissue (16). Loss of the
miR-200 family (miR-200abc, miR-141, miR-429) in particular leads to epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) in normal and cancer cells (17). Restoration of miR-200c is
sufficient to revert mesenchymal breast cancer cells into a more epithelial phenotype
(17-21). Progestins regulate multiple miRNAs in breast cancer cells, the majority (~70%) of
which are downregulated (22-24). providing a mechanism to indirectly control cellular
differentiation. We previously demonstrated that progestin suppression of miR-29 family
members facilitates induction of the transcription factor KLF4 and potentiates the expansion
of CD44+ and CK5+ breast cancer cells (24). miR-141 is also progestin-downregulated in
breast cancer cells (22), and we therefore speculated that it may contribute to expansion of
dedifferentiated breast cancer cells.
The cancer stem cell (CSC) theory posits that a subset of pre-existing CSCs, the putative
origins of malignancies, perpetuate tumors through indefinite self-renewal and replicative
potentials (25). Breast CSCs, compared to bulk tumor cells, are relatively resistant to

conventional drugs and are mostly ER−PR−, thus avoiding endocrine therapies (14, 25, 26).
Notably, a CSC state may be acquired either spontaneously or through environmental
signals during tumor progression (27, 28). Progesterone is one such factor that controls
mammary stem cell plasticity; this could be partially facilitated through miRNA regulation.
We therefore tested whether miR-141 suppression could contribute to P4-mediated cellular
dedifferentiation. Here we demonstrate that miR-141 inhibition enhanced the P4-mediated
increase in CD44high and CK5+ cells. miR-141 directly targeted PR and Stat5a, a
transcription factor and P4-regulated gene (29, 30) that regulates the mammary luminal
progenitor population (31). Stat5a inhibition reduced the P4-mediated increase in CK5+ and
CD44high populations. These findings emphasize that hormonal alteration of miRNA levels
contributes to the regulation of breast CSCs via transcription factors that promote mammary
stem cell populations.

Results
P4 downregulates mature miR-141 in luminal breast cancer cell lines
The miR-200 family is organized on two different chromosomes; the miR-141 gene is
downstream of miR-200c on chr12p13, with the remaining members (miR-200b-200a-429)
clustered on chr1p36 (Figure 1a). To determine whether miR-141 expression correlates with
a particular breast cancer subtype, we assessed miR-141 expression in multiple breast cancer
cell lines. miR-141 was expressed at detectable levels in luminal and basal-like triple
negative (TN) cell lines, and was absent in mesenchymal-like TN cell lines (Supplementary
Figure 1), where the miR-200c/141 cluster is silenced by CpG methylation (32).

Global miRNA profiling of T47D breast cancer cells treated with vehicle or the synthetic
progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) identified miR-141 downregulation at 6 h
post-treatment (22). To confirm P4-mediated regulation of miR-141, luminal breast cancer
cell lines T47D, BT474, and ZR75-1 were treated with vehicle (ethanol) or 100 nM P4 for 6
or 24 h, and mature miR-141 levels measured by qPCR. BT474 and ZR75-1 cells were pretreated with 10 nM 17β-estradiol (E2) for 48 h to induce PR levels. In all three cell lines,
mature miR-141 levels significantly decreased at 6 h post P4 treatment, and returned to pretreatment levels at 24 h (Figure 1b). Co-treatment with the progestin antagonist RU486 for 6
h blocked miR-141 downregulation, suggesting a PR-dependent mechanism. E2 alone had
no effect on miR-141 levels (Supplementary Figure 2). In contrast, mature miR-200a,
miR-200b, and miR-200c levels did not significantly change with 6 h P4 treatment (Figure
1c). An expanded time course confirmed 6 h as the maximal miR-141 reduction point, with
no changes in the other family members (Supplementary Figure 3).

Author Manuscript

Since miR-141 is located downstream of miR-200c on the miR-200c/-141 cluster (32), but
P4 decreases only mature miR-141, we sought to determine if P4 regulates the pri-miRNA
transcript. qPCR with primers specific to pri-miR-141 or pri-miR-200c (provided in
Supplementary Figure 4a) found that both transcripts decreased at 6 h post P4 treatment, and
were blocked by RU486 (Figure 1d). An extended time course (0-12 h) confirmed maximal
downregulation of pri-miR-141 and pri-miR-200 at 6 h (Supplementary Figure 4b). There is
emerging evidence for differential processing of miRNAs located in the same cluster (33),
with separate transcription units observed for miR-141 and miR-200c (32). These data

suggest differential biogenesis of miR-141 and miR-200c following P4 treatment; selective
underexpression of miR-141 has been previously observed in prostate cancer (34).
Stable inhibition of miR-141 potentiates the P4-mediated expansion of CD44high and CK5+
cells

Author Manuscript

We evaluated CD44high and CK5+ populations as both are reported markers of CSCs and are
P4-regulated (9, 24, 35). While there is considerable overlap between the two populations, a
distinct CD44highCK5− population exists (9). Since miR-141 is underexpressed in
CD44highCD24−/low breast CSCs isolated from patient tumors (36), we sought to determine
if miR-141 levels are changed in the P4-induced CD44high population. T47D cells were
treated with vehicle or P4 for 24 h then fluorescence-activate cell sorting (FACS) performed
to isolate the CD44high and CD44low populations. Expression of mature miR-141 was
significantly reduced in both the endogenous and P4-induced CD44high populations (Figure
2a). While this could indicate direct expansion of the CD44high population, conversion is
more probable given a cell doubling time of 36 h and maximal downregulation of miR-141
at 6 h.

Author Manuscript

To determine if miR-141 suppression exacerbates the P4-induced expansion of CD44high
and CK5+ populations, we generated stable control (SCR-ZIP) and miR-141-inhibited (141ZIP) cell lines. SCR-ZIP and 141-ZIP T47D cells were treated with vehicle or P4 for 24 h
and the CD44high and CK5+ populations measured by flow cytometry, or
immunofluorescence and Western blot, respectively. P4 treatment led to a 5-fold increase in
the CD44high population (5%) in SCR-ZIP cells (Figure 2b), as previously described (24).
Vehicle treated 141-ZIP compared to SCR-ZIP cells had a 12 fold increase in the CD44high
population (12%). P4 treated 141-ZIP compared to SCR-ZIP had a 8 fold increase in the
CD44high population (40%) (Figure 2b). CK5+ cells were absent in vehicle treated SCR-ZIP
and 141-ZIP T47D and BT474 cells. The observed P4-induced CK5+ cells in SCR-ZIP cell
lines were potentiated ~2-fold in 141-ZIP cell lines (Figure 2c). By western blot, total PR
protein levels increased 1.5 fold in 141-ZIP cells, and still underwent ligand-dependent
downregulation. CK5 protein levels increased >2 fold in P4-treated 141-ZIP compared to
SCR-ZIP cells (Figure 2d). These results indicate that downregulation of miR-141 alone
contributes to expanding the CD44high population, and potentiates the P4-mediated increases
in the CD44high and CK5+ populations.
Stable inhibition of miR-141 increases the mammosphere and tumor initiating capacity of
breast cancer cells

Author Manuscript

To test whether miR-141 inhibition affects breast cancer cell self-renewal, we performed
mammosphere-formation assays using T47D SCR-ZIP and 141-ZIP cells. P4 treatment
alone increased mammosphere formation of SCR-ZIP cells (Figure 3a). 141-ZIP compared
to SCR-ZIP cells had increased mammosphere formation in both control and P4 treated
samples. Thus, inhibition of miR-141 alone increases the sphere-forming capability of
luminal breast cancer cells, potentially due to increasing the CD44high population, and
enhances the P4-mediated increase in mammosphere formation, potentially due to increased
CD44high and CK5+ cells.

We next evaluated the ability of SCR-ZIP and 141-ZIP cells to initiate tumors; cells were
pre-treated for 24 h with P4 in vitro then injected bilaterally into the fourth mammary fat
pads of female nude mice at dilutions of 102 to 104. Measured at 5 and 6 weeks postimplantation, 141-ZIP cells initiated tumors more efficiently compared to SCR-ZIP cells
(Table 1). These data show that loss of miR-141 enhances tumor-initiating ability, likely due
to amplified CD44high and CK5+ populations.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether the observed differences in sphere and tumor formation could be due
to differential cell growth rate, we measured proliferation of SCR-ZIP and 141-ZIP in vitro
and in vivo. For in vitro experiments, SCR-ZIP and 141-ZIP T47D and BT474 cells were
plated in sextuplicate in 96 well plates, treated with vehicle or 100 nM P4 (T47D), or E2 and
E2+P4 (BT474) and proliferation measured via the Incucyte kinetic live cell imaging system
over 4 days. In two luminal breast cancer lines, 141-ZIP compared to SCR-ZIP cells had
significantly reduced proliferation in the absence or presence of P4 (Figure 3b).
To evaluate tumor growth in vivo, we injected 1×106 T47D SCR-ZIP and 141-ZIP cells in
the fourth mammary fat pad of NOD/SCID mice supplemented with either E2 alone or E2 +
MPA. SCR-ZIP and 141-ZIP cells were implanted on opposing mammary glands for
internal comparison. There was no statistical size difference between SCR-ZIP and 141-ZIP
tumors in the E2-treated group (Figure 3c). Tumors in E2+MPA supplemented mice were
overall smaller as previously observed (24). 141-ZIP compared to SCR-ZIP tumors were not
statistically different in volume or mass, except for one data point at 69 days postimplantation (Figure 3c). We conclude that miR-141 inhibition decreases short-term cell
proliferation, and has no overall effect on long-term tumor growth. Therefore its
enhancement of sphere and tumor initiation is not a function of increased growth capacity.

PR is a direct target of miR-141 and increases with miR-141 inhibition
To determine relevant targets of miR-141 that may be involved in promoting the expansion
of stem-like cells, we focused on transcription factors important in mammary gland
differentiation. Since miR-141 is predicted to target the PGR gene, which encodes both
isoforms of PR (PR-B, PR-A), we first analyzed the effect of miR-141 manipulation on PR
expression. PR protein expression significantly increased in three different luminal breast
cancer cell lines (T47D, BT474, and ZR75-1) with miR-141 inhibition (141-ZIP) (Figure
4a; Figure 2d). Conversely, PR expression was decreased in the same three cell lines when
miR-141 was overexpressed using a lentiviral vector carrying its precursor sequence
(Pre-141) or a scrambled control (Pre-SCR) (Figure 4b).

Author Manuscript

To test if miR-141 directly targets the PR transcript, we analyzed four predicted miR-141
binding sites (Figure 4c); three within the 3′UTR as identified through Targetscan (http://
www.targetscan.org/) and one in the last exon predicted based on Argonaute HITS-CLIP
analysis and corresponding seed match with prediction algorithms (37). These sequences
were each placed separately downstream of a luciferase reporter gene and luciferase activity
measured in the presence of control or miR-141 mimics. MiR-141 mimic significantly
decreased luciferase activity with the coding site (PGR EXON), but not the 3′UTR sites, and
mutation of the predicted coding miR-141 binding site rescued the decrease (Figure 4c;

hatched bars). These results indicate direct targeting of PR through a miR-141 site in the last
exon, which is present in transcripts for both PR-A and PR-B isoforms (38).
To further test this in context, PR-negative HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with
plasmids expressing PR-A and PR-B that contain ~998 bp of the 3′UTR (38). These contain
the exonic binding site but none of the three predicted 3′UTR binding sites. Expression of
both PRA and PRB protein was reduced by miR-141 mimic but not control (Figure 4d).
These data confirm that PR expression levels can be directly altered by miR-141 targeting of
PR transcripts. The heightened PR expression observed with miR-141 inhibition may be a
contributing mechanism that helps potentiate the P4-mediated expansion of CK5+ and
CD44high populations.

Author Manuscript

Stat5a is a direct target of miR-141 and is important for the P4-mediated increase in CK5+
cells

Author Manuscript

Stat5a (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A) is a progestin-regulated gene in
the normal mammary gland that dictates luminal cell fate and is necessary for full lobularalveolar development (39, 40). Stat5a is also progestin-regulated in luminal breast cancer
(30, 41), and is a predicted target of miR-141. We therefore investigated Stat5a regulation
by miR-141 and its involvement in the P4 expansion of stem-like cells. Treatment with a
miR-141 mimic blocked P4-mediated Stat5 upregulation (Figure 5a). To determine if
miR-141 directly targets Stat5a, we placed the predicted miR-141 binding site sequence
downstream of a luciferase reporter gene and measured luciferase activity in the presence of
control or miR-141 mimics. miR-141 mimic significantly decreased luciferase activity for
the Stat5a miR-141 site construct in both T47D and BT474 cells; mutation of the predicted
miR-141 binding site blocked this decrease (Figure 5b). We also analyzed a predicted
miR-141 site in Stat5b and found no significant regulation (Supplementary Figure 5). These
data support that miR-141 directly and specifically regulates Stat5a in breast cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether Stat5a upregulation plays a functional role in the P4-induced
expansion of CK5+ cells, we employed two methods to block Stat5a. First, we used siRNA
to reduce Stat5a protein levels; P4-mediated increases in Stat5 and CK5 expression were
both blocked in the presence of siSTAT5A (Figure 5c). We then analyzed the effects of
siSTAT5A on CK5 promoter activity using T47D cells stably expressing a luciferase
reporter gene driven by the human KRT5 (CK5) promoter (11). The P4-mediated increase in
CK5 expression was significantly inhibited in the presence of siSTAT5A (Figure 5d).
Second, we analyzed the effects of the Stat5 inhibitor Pimozide on the P4-mediated increase
in CK5 expression. Pimozide is a Stat5 inhibitor that acts through inhibition of phosphoStat5 production, but has no effect on NF-kB, Stat3, or Stat1 (42). Treatment of T47D cells
with 500 nM Pimozide for 24 h inhibited P4 induction of CK5+ cells, measured by
immunofluorescence for CK5 (Figure 6a) and CK5-promoter-luciferase activity (Figure 6b).
Likewise, Pimozide reduced the P4 induction of CD44high cells by half (Figure 6c). Taken
together, these results suggest that loss of miR-141 contributes to positive regulation of
Stat5a, which in turn contributes to the P4-dependent expansion of CK5+ and CD44high
breast cancer cells.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Progestins have emerged as crucial regulators of stem cells in the normal mammary gland
and in breast cancer. In normal tissue, this regulation occurs both temporally during peak P4
levels, and spatially, as luminal-located cells signal to basally located MaSCs to expand (2,
3). Our group was first to describe that progestins increase a population of CK5+ stem-like
cells in breast cancer (9, 10). Luminal breast cancer cells appear to directly convert from
CK5− to CK5+ based on tracing studies using a CK5 promoter reporter (11, 43).
Interestingly, transformed human mammary epithelial cells can convert to a
CD44+CD24−/low phenotype spontaneously or via cytokine signals (27, 28). The P4mediated expansion of stem-like cells, while necessary for normal breast function, is
detrimental in breast cancer and may cause increased treatment resistance and recurrence.
Sustained progestin use in hormone replacement therapy is hypothesized to increase breast
tumorigenesis through expansion of pre-malignant stem cells (8). Since breast cancer cells
lose compartmentalization and become more reliant on autocrine signaling (44), we focused
on intracellular P4 signaling events that could potentially influence cell phenotype. In this
article we describe a mechanism by which P4 suppression of miR-200 family member
miR-141 cooperates to increase stem-like breast cancer cells.

Author Manuscript

We demonstrate that miR-141 is the only miR-200 family member temporally
downregulated at the mature level in response to progestins in breast cancer cells. Although
the primary transcript for the miR-141/200c cluster is downregulated, only mature miR-141
levels decrease (Figure 1). There is emerging evidence supporting differential processing,
through multiple mechanisms including differential processing, maintenance of miRNA
stability, and direct or indirect degradation (45-49). A prime example is context dependent
processing of miR-18a within the miR-17 cluster of intronic miRNAs through the RNA
binding protein hnRNP A1 (33). miR-200c is sometimes more abundant than miR-141 due
to differential splicing that creates independent transcription units (32). This could also
explain why it is less sensitive to transient downregulation of the primary transcript.
Notably, miR-141, but not miR-200c, is underexpressed in CD44highCD24−/low prostate
CSCs, further supporting differential regulation of miRNAs located in the same cluster (34).
miR-141 is constitutively underexpressed in CD44high cells, as previously reported (36), and
is transiently downregulated by P4 in the total cell population. This indicates its loss helps
set in motion the gain of CD44high and CK5+ cells (Figure 2). This is similar to a feedback
loop described in hepatocarcinoma cells; several miRNAs and HNF4a set oncogenesis into
motion that cannot be reversed once initiated, even when miRNAs are restored to normal
levels (50).

Author Manuscript

Transcription factors involved in controlling cell fate decisions are common miRNA targets.
In breast cancer these include miR-200 or miR-205 targeting of EMT and stem cell
promoting transcription factors Zeb1/2, Suz12, TWIST1, and BMI1 (17-21, 51, 52). Here
we demonstrate miR-141 directly targets two transcription factors involved in regulating
mammary cell differentiation: PR and Stat5a. P4 repression of miR-141 may allow for
increased PR translation to recover from its ligand-dependent downregulation. The enhanced
number of P4-induced CD44high and CK5+ cells with miR-141 inhibition could be partially
due to more robust PR signaling. Stable inhibition of miR-141 was in fact sufficient to

induce PR expression in breast cancer cell lines that typically require E2/ER-dependent PR
expression (Figure 4). We also demonstrate that miR-141 targets both PR-A and PR-B at a
site within the last coding exon mapped by genome-wide analysis of miRNA binding sites in
luminal breast cancer cells (37).

Author Manuscript

The two highly conserved Stat5 transcription factors (transcribed from two separate genes,
STAT5A and STAT5B) are both positively-regulated by progestins in breast cancer (30).
We demonstrate that Stat5a is specifically targeted by miR-141 in breast cancer cells. Stat5a
is also targeted by miR-141 in the bovine mammary gland (53). Selective deletion of Stat5
genes determined that Stat5a, but not Stat5b, is required for mammary development (39).
Furthermore, Stat5a-null mammary epithelial cells show impaired differentiation, and are
unable to expand the luminal progenitor population, which produces mature ER+PR+
alveolar cells (40, 54). Notably, CK5 is a major marker of luminal progenitor cells, the
putative origin of BRCA1 breast cancers (12). We demonstrate that knockdown and
inhibition of Stat5a reduces P4-mediated expansion of CK5+ and CD44high breast cancer
cells (Figures 5&6). Stat5 is activated by another P4-regulated gene, prolactin receptor
(PRLR). Prolactin (PRL) has been shown to reduce the P4 increase in CK5+ breast cancer
cells, potentially though blocking induction of the transcriptional repressor BCL6 (55).
Other reports found PRL antagonism could reduce clonogenicity and improve chemotherapy
treatment of breast cancer cells and primary tumor xenografts (56), and could block PRL/
Stat5 induction of basal stem-like populations in prostate cancer (57). Thus, interplay
between PR-Stat5a-PRLR signaling in regulating the breast cancer CK5+ population
requires further investigation, and could be a source for therapeutic intervention.

Author Manuscript

Both PR and Stat5a are positive prognostic indicators in breast cancer, and predict better
response to tamoxifen-based endocrine therapy (58, 59). Loss of Stat5 signaling measured
by nuclear phopho-Stat5 correlates with worse prognosis (60). Conversely, both PR- and
Stat5a-null animals exhibit reduced mammary tumorigenesis in murine models (1, 39); this
could be due to reduced stem/progenitor cell populations. In breast cancer cells, P4
upregulates Stat5a transcriptionally through its promoter and post-transcriptionally by
depleting its repressor miR-141. Progestin regulation of stem-like cancer cell populations is
complex; our data demonstrate miRNAs are utilized to modulate expression of mammary
cell fate transcription factors. Downregulation of miR-141 is sufficient for increasing the
CD44high population, as we previously demonstrated with miR-29 (24), and serves to
amplify the progestin signal in increasing the CD44high/CK5+ populations. This luminal to
basal/stem-like cell switch likely involves convergence of multiple signaling factors,
including miRNAs as we demonstrate here. Ultimately, there may be opportunities for small
molecule manipulation of breast cancers to maintain cells in a more treatment-vulnerable
state.

goat anti-rabbit (A11008), AlexaFluor594 goat anti-mouse (A11032) and goat anti-rabbit
(A11037) (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Hormones (17βestradiol, progesterone, and MPA) were purchased from Sigma. Pimozide (573110) was
purchased from EMD Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA).
RNA extraction and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR)

Author Manuscript

Total RNA from cultured cell lines was isolated using Trizol; total RNA from flow-sorted
cells was isolated using the RNAqueous-Micro kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) following
manufacturer instructions. 10,000-50,000 cells were collected in provided lysis buffer.
Analysis of mature miR-141, miR-200abc, and RNU6B (used for normalization) used
TaqMan MicroRNA Assays, TaqMan MicroRNA RT kit, and TaqMan Universal PCR
Master Mix, No AmpErase UNG (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Primers for
pri-miR-141 and pri-200c were designed to flank their respective stem-loop, and analysis
was performed using the Verso cDNA Synthesis kit and ABsolute Blue Sybr Green with
Fluorescein (Thermo-Fisher Scientific). β-actin was used for normalization. The relative
mRNA or miRNA levels were calculated using the Pfaffl method (61).
Flow cytometry

Author Manuscript

Cells were labeled with antibodies CD44-APC, CD44-FITC, CD24-PE (BD Biosciences,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) at a concentration of 1×106 cells per ml in PBS+0.5% BSA, and
were subjected to either flow cytometry analysis on a Gallios or fluorescence-activated cell
sorting analysis on a Moflo XDP 100 (Beckman-Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Analysis
was performed using Kaluza Analysis Software (Beckman-Coulter).
Stable cell lines
Lentiviral vectors were used to stably inhibit miR-141 by expressing complementary
sequences to the mature miRNA (pMIRZIPs, System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA,
USA). Lentiviral vectors containing the precursor sequence for miR-141 were used for

overexpression (pMIRNAs, System Biosciences). A scrambled non-silencing vector was
used as the negative control. Stably-expressing cells were selected using GFP-based cell
sorting (for pMIRNA vectors) or puromycin (miR-ZIP vectors).
Mammosphere assay
Cells were seeded in non-adherent 6-well plates at 1000 cells/well in 2 mL of complete
Mammocult medium (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada). After 24h, cells
were treated with EtOH or 100 nM P4 for 10 days. Mammospheres were photographed, four
fields/well, and mammospheres larger than 75 um in size were counted.
Proliferation assay

Author Manuscript

Real-time imaging (IncuCyte™, ESSEN BioScience Inc, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) was
used to measure cell proliferation using non-labeled phase confluence. BT474 and T47D
SCR-ZIP and 141-ZIP cells were plated at 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates. BT474 cells
were pre-treated with E2 for 48 hours. Cells were treated in sextuplicate with EtOH or P4.
Confluence measurements were started immediately after treatment, and taken every 4h for
a total of 96h.
Tumor growth and limiting dilution formation in vivo

Author Manuscript

Tumor xenografts were developed by injecting the indicated amount of cells in 100%
Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Biosciences) into the fourth mammary fad pad of
ovariectomized female NOD/SCID mice (for tumor growth) or nu/nu mice (for limiting
dilution experiments) (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Silastic pellets containing
either 17β-estradiol alone (1 mg) or in combination with MPA (10 mg) were implanted
subcutaneously at time of tumor cell injection. Tumors were measured weekly using a
digital caliper, and tumor volume estimated using the formula (lw^2)/2. At termination of
the experiment, mice were euthanized and tumors were excised and weighed. These
experiments were performed under an approved University of Colorado Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee protocol.
Immunocytochemistry
Immunocytochemistry was performed as described (62), with additions of EtOH/10 nM P4
and/or DMSO/500 nM Pimozide for 24 h. Images were collected using a Nikon TiE
microscope equipped with a digital camera and NIS Elements software. Adobe Photoshop
CS5 was used to perform linear adjustments to brightness/contrast, assemble pictures into
multipanel figures, and convert images from RGB to CMYK.

Luciferase assays
For 3′UTR-targeting experiments, portions of the 3′UTRs of PGR and STAT5A/B were
cloned into the pmiR-GLO vector (Promega). Sites cloned from PGR are as follows
(numbering based off +1 as first base of the 3′UTR): PGR_EXON, 357–+1; PGR_UTR_1,
2997–3961; PGR_UTR_2, 5764–6710; PGR_UTR_3, 8258–9073. Mutagenesis was
performed by altering each predicted miR-141 site to 5′-GTCACCA. The site cloned from
STAT5A is contained within bases 990-1255; mutagenesis altered the miR-141 binding site

to 5′-CAGTGTT. Sites cloned from STAT5B are as follows: STAT5B_1, 1-379;
STAT5B_2, 1329-1604. Mutagenesis altered STAT5B_1 to 5′-TCACAAT; STAT5B_2 was
altered to 5′-GTCACAA. Cells were plated into 96 well plates at 104 cells/well. Cells were
transfected in octuplicate with dual transfection reagent (Invitrogen) using 10ng of pmiRGLO empty vector, or vectors containing most common sequence or mutated predicted
miR-141 binding sites. Cells were lysed after 24 h and luciferase assays performed using the
Dual Luciferase Reporter luciferase assay (Promega).
For K5P-Luc, T47D cells (11) were plated at 104 cells per well and transfected with siNC or
siSTAT5A. After 24 h, EtOH or P4 was added for 24 h, cells lysed and luciferase activity
measured. For Pimozide experiments, 500 nM Pimozide or vehicle (DMSO) was added in
combination with EtOH or P4 for 24 h. pRL-SV40 Renilla vector (Promega) was the
transfection efficiency control.

P4 downregulates mature miR-141 in a PR-dependent manner. (a) Chromosomal
organization of the miR-200 family; the miR-200c-141 and miR-200b-200a-429 clusters are
located on different chromosomes. (b) P4 downregulates mature miR-141. Using
quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), miR-141 levels decrease by 6 h 100 nM
P4 treatment in luminal breast cancer cell lines (T47D, BT474, and ZR75-1), and restore to
original levels after 24 h 100 nM P4 treatment; downregulation of miR-141 is blocked by
the PR antagonist RU486. Indicated cells were treated with vehicle, 100 nM P4, or P4 plus 1
μM RU486 for 6 h and miR-141 levels measured by qRT-PCR. Data represent fold change

miR-141 regulates PR expression levels in luminal breast cancer cell lines and directly
targets the PR transcript. (a) Stable inhibition of miR-141 increases PR expression. PR
expression was measured by Western blot in untreated T47D, BT474, or ZR75-1 cells with
stable inhibition of miR-141 (141-ZIP) or scrambled control (SCR-ZIP). PR-A and PR-B
isoforms are indicated. β-actin was used as loading control. (b) Stable overexpression of
miR-141 decreases endogenous PR expression. PR expression measured by Western blot in
untreated T47D, BT474, or ZR75-1 cells with stable overexpression of miR-141 (Pre-141)
or control (Pre-SCR). β-actin was used as loading control. (c) miR-141 directly targets PR
through a binding site in the last exon. Predicted miR-141 binding sites in the PR 3′UTR and
last exon are outlined below the graph. Regions of the 3′UTR as indicated were cloned

Stat5a is a direct target of miR-141 and contributes to the P4 expansion of CK5+ cells. (a)
P4 increases Stat5 expression, which is partially blocked by miR-141. Western blot analysis
of Stat5 and CK5 protein expression in T47D cells treated with EtOH (−) or 100 nM P4 (+),
and with negative control mimic (NC) or miR-141 mimic. Fold change of Stat5 and CK5
compared to EtOH/NC mimic is indicated; quantification is normalized to α-tubulin
(loading control). (b) Stat5a is directly targeted by miR-141. The STAT5A 3′-UTR was
cloned downstream of luciferase in the pMIR-GLO vector and the predicted binding site was
mutagenized to abolish miR-141 binding ability. The construct (solid bars) or its
mutagenized counterpart (patterned bars) was transfected into T47D or BT474 cells with
either 50 nM negative control or miR-141 mimic and luciferase activity measured after 48 h.
Data represents relative luciferase activity normalized to constitutively active Renilla
contained on the same vector. Experiments were repeated twice. Bars are mean +/− SEM;
*** P<0.0001. (c) siSTAT5A blocks P4-mediated upregulation of Stat5. Western blot of
Stat5 and CK5 protein expression of T47D cells treated with EtOH or 100 nM P4, with or
without 5 or 10 nM siSTAT5A. α-tubulin was used as loading control. Fold changes in Stat5
and CK5 relative to vehicle with negative control siRNA are indicated. (d) siSTAT5A
inhibits P4 induction of CK5+. T47D cells stably expressing a luciferase reporter driven by
the CK5 gene (KRT5) promoter were plated at 10,000 cells per well in 96-well plates. After
24 h, cells were transfected with SV40-Renilla vector and 5 nM negative control (siNC) or
On-Target pool siSTAT5A using dual transfection reagent. Cells were treated for an
additional 24 h with vehicle (EtOH) or 100 nM P4, and luciferase activity measured. Renilla
