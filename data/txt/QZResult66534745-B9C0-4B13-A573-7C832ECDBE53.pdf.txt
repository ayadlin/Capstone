BACKGROUND. Pediatric renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is clinically distinct from
adult RCC.1 Characterization of the unique biological and clinical features of
pediatric RCC are required.

METHODS. A retrospective review and biological analysis of all RCC cases presenting to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) in the last 30 years
was undertaken. Cases were classified according to the recent World Heath
Organization morphologic classification and according to TFE3/TFEB status.
A literature review of pediatric TFE1 cases was performed.

toid. Upon reanalysis, 1 papillary and 1 sarcomatoid were confirmed, 1 case was
morphology. Of these 8, all demonstrated immunoreactivity for TFE3 (7 patients)
or TFEB (1 patient) protein. In 3 cases, cytogenetics was available, each demonstrating confirmatory MiTF/TFE translocations. Seven of 8 TFE1 RCC patients
presented with TNM Stage III/IV disease. Literature analysis confirmed a significant increase in advanced stage presentation in pediatric TFE1 RCC compared
with TFE2 RCC. Fourteen of fifteen (93.3%) patients with TFE1 stage III/IV RCC
due to lymph node spread (N1 M0) remain disease free with a median and
mean follow-up of 4.4 and 6.3 years, respectively (range, 0.3-15.5).

CONCLUSIONS. Translocation morphology RCC is the predominant form of pediatric RCC, associated with an advanced stage at presentation. Patients with TFE1
N1 M0 RCC maintain a favorable short-term prognosis after surgery alone. Young
RCC patients should be screened for translocation morphology, and the screening
information should be considered when debating adjuvant therapy. Cancer

enal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the second most common form of
renal malignancy in the pediatric population, accounting for 2%
to 6% of renal cancers in children and adolescents.1–3 Median age at
diagnosis is 9-12 years, with equal prevalence in both males and
females.1–11 Stage-specific survival for pediatric RCC is 92.5%,
84.6%, 72.7%, and 12.7% for Modified Robson stages I-IV, respectively.1 Overall survival for pediatric RCC approximates 63%, with
stages III and IV accounting for >55% of cases.1
Recent data suggest that pediatric RCC is different from adult
RCC,1,4–6 clinically manifested by better survival for pediatric
patients with local lymph node positive (N1) disease. While >70%
of pediatric RCC patients with N1 disease remain alive and disease
free independent of adjuvant therapy,1 only 20% of adults with N1

RCC remain alive at 5 years from diagnosis.12,13 The
histological and biological features unique to pediatric RCC have been an area of recent investigation
and may account for the defined clinical differences
noted, and, perhaps, undefined clinical differences
yet to be appreciated.14–19 Specifically, translocation
morphology (TFE1) RCC has become increasingly
recognized as a distinct form of RCC in young
patients, characterized by translocations most frequently involving the TFE3 gene on chromosome
Xp11.2 or the TFEB gene on chromosome 6p21.17,18
TFE3 and TFEB are members of the MiTF/TFE family
(also including MITF and TFEC), a subgroup of basic
helix-loop–helix-leucine zipper transcription factors
that share near complete homology in their DNA
binding domains.6,17,18
We, therefore, reviewed our Cincinnati Children’s
Hospital Medical Center experience with pediatric
RCC for the purpose of better defining the unique
clinical and biological features of ‘‘pediatric RCC’’
and to ascertain whether a biological signature exists
to explain the improved outcome of pediatric RCC
patients with N1 disease. In addition, a focused literature analysis of TFE1 pediatric RCC was conducted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Institutional review board approval was obtained for
a retrospective clinical review and biological study of
pediatric RCC cases diagnosed at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. The current study
focuses on the cases for which clinical data and biological material were available. All cases of RCC for
which adequate biological tissue was available were
investigated for TFE status. Clinical data extracted
included the following: age at diagnosis, sex, ethnicity, disease histology, disease sites enabling TNM
staging, treatment, and outcome. No patient identifiers were extracted during the chart review process
in accordance with the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and good clinical
research practices.
Morphology and Immunohistochemistry
All tumors had been fixed in formalin and slides had
been prepared from paraffin-embedded tissue. Slides
were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate for TFE morphology. TFE3 and TFEB stains were
interpreted independently of knowing the cytogenetics, patient age, and hematoxylin and eosin (H &
E) sections. Immunochemistry for TFE3 and TFEB
were performed by using previously published
methods.20,21

Literature Review
Medline (PubMed) searches were undertaken to
identify all cases of pediatric RCC published in the
English-language literature for which TFE, lymph
node, and outcome data are available. PubMed
search phrases included pediatric renal cell carcinoma, childhood renal cell carcinoma, translocation
renal cell carcinoma, and adolescent renal cell carcinoma. TNM staging was applied in accordance with
the 1997 Union Internationale Contre le Cancer and
the American Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/
AJCC) standard TNM staging for RCC.22

RESULTS
Pediatric RCC: The Cincinnati Children’s Hospital
Medical Center (CCHMC) Experience: CCHMC
Patient Characteristics
Fifteen children were diagnosed with RCC at CCHMC
between 1959 and October 2004, accounting for 10%
of all malignant kidney tumors in the pathology
database. Three patients diagnosed before 1974 did
not have adequate clinical information available and
were, thus, evaluated for histology only. One patient
was diagnosed with renal medullary carcinoma and
excluded from further analysis. Patient characteristics, disease characteristics, and patient outcomes of
the remaining 11 patients are summarized in Table 1.
Median and mean ages at presentation were 16 years
and 13.7 years, respectively.
Eight of 11 patients were female including 6 of 8
patients with TFE1 RCC. The ethnic breakdown
shows TFE1 RCC in 4 African American, 3 Caucasian, and 1 Hispanic patient, respectively. Adding this
cohort to previously published pediatric TFE1 RCC
cases for which information is available on sex (n 5
42),1,2,6,14,19 and ethnicity (n 5 24),1,14,19 TFE1 RCC
was found in 28 females and 14 males (a ratio of 2:1)
with an ethnic distribution of 15 African American,
8 Caucasian, and 1 Hispanic.
Presenting symptoms included pain (3), mass
and/or fullness to palpation (3), hematuria (2), incidental finding (2), chronic pyelonephritis (1), constitutional symptoms (2 patients; 1 with fever and 1
with weight loss), and hypertension with renal failure
(1). No patient presented with the classic triad of abdominal mass, pain, and hematuria. No patient was
diagnosed with or had a known family history of
tuberous sclerosis or von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.
Two patients developed translocation morphology
RCC as a second malignancy after treatment for a
prior malignancy (1 with APML and 1 with bilateral
Wilms tumor), reported previously.21,23,24

CCHMC Tumor Characteristics
The primary tumor occurred in the right kidney in
5 cases and in the left kidney in 5 cases (1 not documented). No patient demonstrated bilateral disease,
although 1 patient presented with RCC in a kidney
contralateral to that patient’s prior dominant Wilms
tumor. Reported initial histologies were 6 clear cell, 2
papillary, 2 translocation, and 1 sarcomatoid. By
using the 2004 WHO classification system, all clear
cell except 1 showed translocation morphology, and
1 was unclassified. In addition, 1 case of papillary
RCC showed translocation morphology. On the basis
of recent insights into histological subcategories of
translocation morphology17 (Tables 2 and 3; Fig. 1),
by morphology alone, t(X;17) translocations were
suspected in 5 cases, t(X;1) in 1, nonspecific Xp11
translocation in 1, and t(6;11) in 1. TFE3 staining was
positive in all 7 patients suspected of having either
t(X;17), t(X;1) or nonspecific Xp11 findings by morphology. TFEB staining was positive in the 1 case
suspected of having the t(6;11) translocation. Cases
immunoreactive for TFE3 were negative for TFEB
and vice-versa. In addition, all other cases were negative for both TFE3 and TFEB. Cytogenetic evaluation
was available on 3 cases and confirmed the presence
of t(X;17) translocations in 2 cases and t(6;11) in 1
case, as predicted by morphology and TFE3/TFEB
immunohistochemical analysis. Psammoma bodies
were found in 5 cases of TFE31 RCC. Three additional cases of RCC in our archives were analyzed for

case of t(6;11), and 1 unclear case), with 2 cases of
TFE31 and 1 case of TFEB1. (Table 3; Fig. 1).

CCHMC Clinical Characteristics
Three patients had distant metastatic disease, and 3
patients had local lymph node involvement at diagnosis. The stage distribution according to the TNM
system was stage I in 3 patients, stage II in 1 patient,
stage III in 1 patient, and stage IV in 6 patients. The
stage distribution according to the Modified Robson
system4 was stage I in 4 patients, stage III in 4
patients, and stage IV in 3 patients. The typical
downward shift from stage IV to stage III that occurs

with the Modified Robson system compared with the
TNM system is because of the difference in stage
allocation of patients with N2 disease (Stage III for
Modified Robson and Stage IV for TNM).
All patients received an upfront nephrectomy and
various degrees of lymph node dissection. All 4
patients who received therapy beyond surgery had
TFE31 disease, and none are disease-free (3 dead
from disease and 1 alive with disease). Patient 1 with
lymph node involvement in the absence of hematogenous spread (N1 M0) developed pulmonary and bone
metastases approximately 1 year postnephrectomy at
which time radiation and vinblastine therapy was
initiated without response. Patients 8 and 10 received
immunotherapy with benefit noted for Patient 8 who
has achieved prolonged stable disease (repeat biopsy
proven pulmonary metastases now stable >7 years after interleukin-2 therapy). Patient 10 progressed on
interleukin-2, interferon-a, and 5-fluorouracil combination therapy, on 17-AAG experimental therapy, and
on bevacizumab (Avastin) and erlotinib (Tarceva)
combination therapy. Ultimately, Patient 10 achieved
transient stable disease >6 months (with subjective
improvement in quality of life) on gemcitabine and
doxorubicin alternating with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin. Patient 6’s treatment history is not available.
Overall, 7 of 11 (63.6%) patients were alive and
well at their most recent follow-up visits, with 1
patient alive with stable disease with a median and
mean follow-up of 4 years and 7.9 years, respectively
(range, 2.7-15.4 years). The 4 patients with papillary,
unclassified, sarcomatoid, and TFEB1 RCC are each
alive and disease free. Two of 7 (29%) of patients

with TFE31 disease are alive and well with 1 additional patient with TFE31 disease alive and diseasefree more than 2 years from nephrectomy who ultimately died because of complications resulting from
end-stage renal failure (previously treated for acute
promyelocytic leukemia and diagnosed with renal
failure and hypertension before renal cell carcinoma), and 1 additional patient alive with stable
disease >7 years after completion of all therapy.
Thus, the disease-related mortality for this cohort of
TFE31 cases is 3 of 7 (43%) with a mean and median
follow-up of 4 years and 6.2 years, respectively
(range, 1.1-15.4). All 3 patients with TFE31 hematogenous metastasis at diagnosis did not achieve remission (Patients 6, 8, and 10). Of the 3 patients who
presented with TFE31 N1 disease in the absence of
hematogenous spread, 1 is alive and disease free,
1 died from end-stage renal disease with no evidence
of cancer before death, and 1 died from relapse
(Patients 1, 4, and 7).

Stage and Prognostic Significance of Local Lymph Node
Involvement in TFE31 RCC
Six of the 7 patients with TFE31 disease presented
with TNM stage IV disease, 3 of which were allocated
stage IV status because of lymph node spread rather
than hematogenous spread (N1 M0; Modified Robson stage III). Of those who developed hematogenous spread, the outcome was poor, with only
1 survivor (with active disease) in this cohort. However,
for the 3 patients with TFE31 N1 M0, we observed
2 patients who did not relapse (although 1 died from
end-stage renal disease). Previous reports have

shown that pediatric RCC patients with N1 M0 status
have a favorable prognosis, as 42 of 58 were alive
and disease free at last follow-up.1 On the basis of
the data above, we investigated the literature to
explore the hypothesis that translocation morphology
RCC is 1) the predominant form of RCC in the pediatric age range, 2) presents with advanced disease,
and 3) associated with a favorable prognosis when
presenting with N1 M0 disease, thereby explaining
previously published clinical findings.1
Upon re-review, none of the previously published
cases reviewed in the recent meta-analysis of pediatric RCC with N1 M0 disease included TFE status.1
Subsequently, however, 4 relatively large institutional
reports and 1 registry report of pediatric RCC have
been published.1,2,6,14,19,25 (Table 4) The recent 5
children’s hospital reports (including this one) report
38 of 61 (62.3%) patients to have features consistent
with translocation RCC by immunohistochemistry
and/or morphological features. The large German
Registry reported only 11 of 49 (22.4%) of patients to
have features consistent with translocation RCC.2 In
total, 49 of 110 (44.5%) cases in these 6 reports
demonstrated translocation RCC.
Accurate staging information and TFE status were
available for 75 patients in these recent reports (35
TFE2 patients and 40 TFE1 patients).2,6,14,19 These
data are summarized in Table 5 and reveal that lowstage disease (Stages I and II) as well as high-stage
disease (Stages III and IV) were relatively comparable
between the registry report versus the institutional
reports, particularly for the TFE1 cohorts. Importantly, approximately 65% of patients with TFE2 disease presented with low-stage disease, whereas 65%
of patients with TFE1 disease presented with highstage disease (2-tailed P 5.011 by Fisher exact test).

Including our cases published herein, a majority
of high-stage (stage III/IV) cases are N1 M0 (15 of
26 TFE1 equaled 57.7%; 6 of 12 TFE2 equaled 50%;
21 of 38, overall 5 55.3%). Of the 15 patients with
TFE1 N1 M0 disease, 93.3% patients remained disease free at last follow-up with a median and mean
follow-up of 4.4 years and 6.3 years, respectively
(range, 0.3-15.5).1,2,6,14,19 One patient died from disease, and 1 patient died from end-stage renal disease
(current report), yielding an overall survival of 13 of
15 (87%). Importantly, of the 15 patients, 3 patients
received adjuvant therapy (1 chemotherapy, 1 radiation therapy, and 1 immunotherapy), and the treatment history is unknown for 3 patients. Of the
remaining 9 who received no adjuvant therapy, 2
relapsed (1 died from unresectable metastatic disease
despite salvage radiation and vinblastine chemotherapy [current study]), and 1 achieved a second complete remission via combination therapy that
included a second surgery yielding a second complete remission). Thus 8 of 9 (88.9%) patients who
did not receive upfront adjuvant therapy were alive
and disease free at the time of last follow-up.

DISCUSSION
Pediatric RCC behaves in a clinically distinct fashion
compared with adult forms of RCC.1 The biological
reasons as to why pediatric patients with N1 M0
RCC have a favorable outcome has thus far gone
unexplained. In the last several decades, however,
translocation RCC has emerged as a common form of
pediatric RCC. Translocation (TFE1) RCC is characterized by translocations involving chromosome
Xp11.2,26,27 the locus of the TFE3 gene. Common
fusion partners are the ASPL gene26,28 at chromosome

17q25 and the PRCC gene29,30 at chromosome 1q21.
Histologically, t(X;17)(p11.2;q25) translocation RCC
has been described to contain clear cells with
voluminous cytoplasm, the presence of psammoma
bodies (calcium deposits with a swirled configuration frequently seen in papillary-like carcinomas),
and a noncohesive pattern with pseudopapillary or
alveolar architecture,17,26,31 whereas tumors with
t(X;1)(p11.2;q21) translocations typically have a papillary architecture which is nested and more compact, rare voluminous clear cells, and infrequent
psammoma bodies.17,27 The prevalence and clinical
behavior of RCC that harbors the translocation
t(6;11)(p21.1;q12) has not been characterized, but the
translocation fuses the TFEB gene on 6p21 with the
Alpha gene on chromosome 11q12, resulting in overexpression of native TFEB protein.32 Histologically,
TFEB1 RCC appears epithelioid and polygonal and
stains positive for HMB45 (Human Melanoma Black
45) but stains negative for epithelial markers.17,21,33
Our experience at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital
Medical Center and our review of the recent literature indicate that translocation RCC is perhaps the
single, most common, histological subtype appreciated in childhood and adolescent age groups. Our
single-institution cohort reflected TFE1 RCC in
approximately 70% of our patients, a rate similar to
that reported by several other large pediatric cancer
treatment centers14,19 but in contrast to that reported
recently from the German population-based study
that reported a translocation RCC rate of 22.4%.2 The
German registry tumor histologies were centrally
reviewed in only 88% of cases, TFE immunostaining
was performed in only 26 of 49 (53%) cases, and histological assignment was either unknown or unclassified in 12 of 49 (24.5%) cases. This is concerning,

because translocation RCC, while distinct in its
appearance, can mimic the histologic appearance of
both papillary and clear cell RCC.17,26,31 It should
also be noted, however, that referral bias may lead to
the referral of more advanced RCC cases (and hence
more TFE1 RCC) to large pediatric treatment centers
like the single-center institutions included in Table 5.
Nonetheless, data support a hypothesis that the true
proportion of pediatric RCCs that harbor TFE1 translocations is somewhere close to 70%. It is also noteworthy that 3 of 3 patients from the 1950s–1970s
demonstrated TFE1 disease in this limited cohort,
confirming that the new WHO classification of translocation morphology RCC represents an advance in
our biological understanding of RCC rather than the
emergence of new tumor biology.
In our institutional cohort as well as in our literature review, we observed TFE1 RCC more frequently in female and in African-American patients.
Confirmation of increased predisposition to TFE1
RCC in these patient groups awaits prospective
national study. Our institutional report also confirms
that, unlike adult RCC, TFE1 RCC frequently occurs
as a second malignancy.2,6,17,21,23,24,26
Castellanos et al. reviewed 150 cases of pediatric
RCC reported between 1934 and 1974, among which,
7 were identified as N1 M0 (Robson stage IIC). Six of
7 were reported to be alive without disease at their
last follow-up.7 Subsequently, Geller and Dome
reviewed the pediatric RCC literature from 1974 to
2004 and found that 42 of 58 (72.4%) pediatric RCC
patients with N1 M0 disease were alive and disease
free at their last follow-up. In addition, they reported
stage-specific incidence to reflect 105 of 243 (43.2%)
low-stage (Stage I and II) and 138 of 243 (56.8%)
high-stage (Stage III and IV) disease.1 Both reviews,

however, are limited by reporting bias inherent in
any retrospective study that incorporates numerous
small reports. In the current review, of 75 patients
consecutively enrolled at 4 large pediatric referral
centers and onto 1 national registry, the stage-specific incidence is 37 of 75 (51%) low-stage and 36 of 75
(49%) high-stage. Whereas definitive conclusions
regarding TNM and Modified Robson stage incidence
in pediatric RCC will have to await prospective study,
the statistically increased high-stage incidence in
TFE1 cases (65%) and low-stage incidence in TFE2
cases (65%) is noteworthy. Furthermore, the majority
of high-stage cases are N1 M0. Given the relative frequency of TFE1 N1 M0 disease and its favorable
short-term prognosis (>87% survival), it is likely that
TFE1 biology accounts for the striking clinical pattern that clearly distinguishes pediatric and young
adult RCC from traditional clear cell and papillary
RCC previously described.1
The data presented demonstrate a relatively
favorable short-term prognosis associated with regional lymph node involvement in pediatric TFE1
RCC, without use of adjuvant therapy, with followup in some patients spanning 15 years. However,
although uncommon, several case reports documenting the potential for delayed recurrence of
TFE1 RCC have emerged, paralleling the behavior
of the genetically similar alveolar soft part sarcoma.34,35 The clinical efficacy of new front-line
multityrosine kinase inhibitors that target the vascular endothelial growth factor pathway (sunitinib,
sorafenib) and agents that target the mTOR pathway
(temsirolimus) have improved the outcome for
adults with RCC.36 However, the utility of these new
therapies in the adjuvant setting remains unproven
and an area of intense ongoing and planned clinical
research (Protocols: NCT00326898, NCT00375674;
http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). This undetermined
efficacy, combined with the relatively favorable shortterm outcomes for children with N1 RCC, particularly those with TFE1 N1 M0 disease and in the
absence of adjuvant therapy, suggests that adjuvant
therapy is not indicated for such children at this
time. To this end, it is important to note that translocation morphology is not unique to the very
young (Table 2), and its relative frequency in ‘‘young
adults’’ has not been established.21,31 It is also reasonable to hypothesize that RCC biology predicts
clinical behavior rather than age, and, thus, it seems
prudent to screen TFE status in all patients with
RCC occurring in situations where TFE1 disease is
possibly prevalent (pediatric RCC, RCC as a secondary cancer, and in young adults), and consider such
information when debating the merits of adjuvant

therapy—whether in the context of a clinical trial or
otherwise.
The mainstay of treatment for RCC remains surgical; however, the role of lymph node dissection in
the management of RCC remains controversial.37–40
It has been suggested that lymph node dissection
has a positive effect on the survival of children with
RCC, and, thus, children with RCC may warrant
more aggressive surgery.41 Although the clinical data
presented would support such a consideration, the
problem with applying this recommendation to children is that most children are suspected of having
Wilms tumor, and standard surgery for Wilms tumor
does not involve an extensive upfront lymph node
dissection. Given the observation that the majority of
children with N1 M0 RCC survive, particularly if they
are TFE1, then it is prudent to consider second-look
lymph node resections if suspicious lymph nodes are
observed on postsurgery radiological studies.
Despite the favorable prognosis of low-stage resectable RCC, and at least in the short term for resectable TFE1 N1 M0 RCC, a significant proportion of
both TFE1 and TFE2 pediatric RCC presents with hematogenous spread and has a dismal prognosis. Two
children with metastatic RCC were cured with highdose interleukin-2, but such therapy was associated
with significant toxicity.42,43 Recent investigation has
shown that the gene expression profiles of TFE31
RCC reflect a closer relation to alveolar soft-part sarcoma rather than to adult-type RCC.44 This may
explain the lack of clinical benefit appreciated in our
TFE1 patient treated with immunotherapy who
subsequently benefited from sarcoma-based doxorubicin-gemcitabine-oxaliplatin-irinotecan therapy. In
addition, overexpression of the MET tyrosine kinase
receptor in approximately 75% of TFE1 RCCs
suggests that MET inhibitors, now in clinical phase
2 investigation for adults with papillary RCC
(NCT00345423; http://www.clinicaltrials.gov), may
have clinical utility for patients with advanced TFE1
carcinomas.45 Defective mitotic checkpoint function
found in t(X;1) TFE1 RCC may confer chemosensitivity to agents that target the mitotic apparatus.46 Unraveling the biological features unique to translocation
RCC will enable the identification of therapeutic targets to explore in the treatment of such patients,
followed by prospective clinical investigation.
In conclusion, TFE1 RCC is a common, if not
the most common, form of RCC in children, characterized by a statistically significant increased risk of
advanced stage at presentation, confirming prior suspicion.26 However, such advanced presentation is often reflective of N1 M0 status (Modified Robson
stage IIIb; TNM stage III or IV), a situation that

Translocation Morphology Renal Cell Carcinoma/Geller et al.

portends a favorable short-term prognosis independent of adjuvant therapy. As such, it is recommended
that pediatric patients with N1 M0 RCC, particularly
those with TFE1 N1 M0 disease, be spared adjuvant
therapy until highly effective nontoxic treatments are
identified. Furthermore, it seems prudent that all
young RCC patients have their tumors screened via
morphological review and TFE immunohistochemistry for the presence of translocation RCC, and that
such information be considered when debating the
merits of treatment options, particularly in the adjuvant setting. Further investigation of the biological
and molecular characteristics of TFE2 and TFE1 pediatric RCC are warranted. The currently accruing
Children’s Oncology Group’s AREN0321 protocol is
the first national, prospective, pediatric RCC study. It
aims to systematically characterize the epidemiology,
histology, morphology, TFE status, and clinical features of pediatric RCC and to test the hypothesis that
pediatric patients with RCC with N1 M0 disease do
not require adjuvant therapy. Such a prospective
study in conjunction with biological specimen acquisition holds promise in enabling the further unraveling of the unique features of pediatric and young
adult RCC.
