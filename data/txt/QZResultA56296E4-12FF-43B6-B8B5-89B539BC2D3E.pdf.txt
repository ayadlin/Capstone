Abstract
The aberrant activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) pathway has been reported to correlate with adverse
clinical outcome in human glioblastoma in vivo. However, the
question of how this survival network can be successfully
targeted to restore the sensitivity of glioblastoma to apoptosis
induction has not yet been answered. Here, we report that
inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 broadly sensitizes wild-type
and mutant PTEN glioblastoma cells to both death receptor–
and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, whereas mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition is not sufficient to
restore apoptosis sensitivity. LY294002 significantly enhances
apoptosis triggered by tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), agonistic anti-CD95 antibodies,
or several anticancer drugs (i.e., doxorubicin, etoposide, and
vincristine) in a highly synergistic manner. In addition,
LY294002 cooperates with TRAIL or doxorubicin to suppress
colony formation, thus also showing a strong effect on longterm survival. Similarly, genetic knockdown of PI3K subunits
p110A and/or p110B by RNA interference (RNAi) primes
glioblastoma cells for TRAIL- or doxorubicin-mediated
apoptosis. In contrast to PI3K inhibition, pharmacologic or
genetic blockade of mTOR by RAD001 (everolimus), rapamycin, or RNAi fails to enhance TRAIL- or doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis. Analysis of apoptosis pathways reveals that PI3K
inhibition acts in concert with TRAIL or doxorubicin to trigger
mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, caspase activation, and caspase-dependent apoptosis, which are abolished
by the caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Aspfluoromethylketone. Most importantly, PI3K inhibition by
LY294002 sensitizes primary cultured glioblastoma cells
obtained from surgical specimens to TRAIL- or chemotherapy-induced cell death. By showing that PI3K inhibition
broadly primes glioblastoma cells for apoptosis, our findings
provide the rationale for using PI3K inhibitors in combination
regimens to enhance TRAIL- or chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in glioblastoma. [Cancer Res 2008;68(15):6271–80]

extremely poor (1). Hence, there is a need to develop novel
treatment strategies to improve outcome. Evasion of apoptosis, the
intrinsic suicide program of the cell, is a hallmark of human
cancers (2). Defects in apoptosis may confer resistance to therapy
because most current treatment approaches (e.g., chemotherapy or
g-irradiation) primarily act by triggering apoptosis in cancer cells
(3). Thus, current attempts to improve the survival of glioblastoma
patients will have to include strategies that specifically target
tumor cell resistance to apoptosis.
There are two major apoptosis signaling pathways, the death
receptor (extrinsic) pathway and the mitochondrial (intrinsic)
pathway, which both lead to activation of effector caspases (4). In
the death receptor (extrinsic) pathway, stimulation of death
receptors of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily,
such as CD95 (APO-1/Fas) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL) receptors, results in activation of caspase-8, which
in turn directly cleaves effector caspase-3 and indirectly promotes
caspase-3 activation by initiating the mitochondrial pathway via
cleavage of Bid (5, 6). The mitochondrial (intrinsic) pathway can be
engaged by treatment with anticancer drugs, which leads to the
release of apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c, from the
mitochondrial interspace into the cytosol, where cytochrome c
initiates caspase-3 activation by the cytochrome c/caspase-9/apaf-1
containing apoptosome complex (7). In addition, caspaseindependent apoptosis and nonapoptotic modes of cell death,
such as autophagy, have also been described (8, 9). The concept
of directly triggering apoptosis by engaging death receptors is
attractive for cancer therapy because death receptors have a direct
link to the cell intrinsic death program. TRAIL is a prime candidate
for cancer therapy because it predominantly kills cancer cells while
sparing normal cells (10). However, many tumors remain resistant
to TRAIL, often as a result of aberrant activation of survival
pathways (11).
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) sits at the apex of a
complex, multi-armed signaling network that not only mediates
survival signals but also regulates proliferation, glucose metabolism, angiogenesis, and apoptosis (12–14). Whereas PI3K is
presumed to activate most of its downstream targets via the Akt
protein, the network rapidly diversifies into many distinct arms
thereafter, one of which leads to the activation of the mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its targets (15). Furthermore,
intricate interactions between allegedly independent survival
networks, such as the PI3K- and Raf/mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MEK/ERK)–
activated pathways, have also been described (16, 17). Deregulation
of the PI3K-mediated signaling network plays a central role in
tumor formation and progression and is frequently observed in a
variety of human cancers, including glioblastoma, as a result of, for
example, genetic alterations or deregulated growth factor signaling

(18, 19). Recently, a correlation between PI3K pathway activation
and highest-grade tumors, decreased apoptosis in tumor samples,
and adverse clinical outcome was shown in primary samples of
human gliomas (20).
The PI3K network has attracted much attention because it
provides promising targets for cancer drug discovery, and a series
of inhibitors of the PI3K pathway are currently under development
(21, 22). However, the question whether such inhibitors can be
exploited to restore the sensitivity of glioblastoma to apoptosis
induction has not yet been answered. To address this question, we
investigated in the present study the role of PI3K-mediated
signaling in the regulation of apoptosis in glioblastoma.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and chemicals. Glioblastoma cell lineswere obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM or RPMI 1640 (Life
Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS (Biochrom), 1 mmol/L
glutamine (Biochrom), 1% penicillin/streptavidin (Biochrom), and 25 mmol/L
HEPES (Biochrom) as described previously (23). LN18 and LN229 cells express
wild-type PTEN, whereas all the other cell lines used harbor mutant PTEN (24).
For experiments, cells were seeded at 0.4  105/cm2 to 0.8  105/cm2, allowed
to settle for 24 h, washed once with PBS, and serum starved for 24 h before
treatment.
Primary cultured glioblastoma cells. Primary glioblastoma cells were
isolated by mechanical disaggregation from surgical specimens obtained
from three patients with grade 4 glioma (GB1–GB3) and cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FCS (Biochrom), 1 mmol/L glutamine (Biochrom),
1% penicillin/streptavidin (Biochrom), and 25 mmol/L HEPES (Biochrom).
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee, Medical Faculty,
University of Ulm. Clinical and histopathologic data on patients’ tumors are
summarized in Supplementary Table S1. Purity of cultured glioblastoma
cells was >90% as assessed by expression of microtubule-associated protein
2 (examples are shown in Supplementary Fig. S5A; ref. 25). Expression of
PTEN protein was not detectable in any of the cultured samples
(Supplementary Fig. S5B).
Determination of apoptosis and necrosis. Glioblastoma cells were
pretreated for 1 h with kinase inhibitors LY294002 (Calbiochem),
wortmannin (Sigma), RAD001 everolimus; kindly provided by H. Lane
(Novartis Institute for BioMedical Research, Oncology Basel, Novartis
Pharma AG), or rapamycin (Sigma), and then treated with TRAIL (R&D
Systems, Inc.), agonistic anti-CD95 (APO-1) antibody (23) and protein A
(5 ng/mL; Sigma), doxorubicin, etoposide, or vincristine (all from Sigma), or
N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk; Bachem)
in the presence or absence of inhibitors in serum-free medium. Apoptosis
was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis
(FACScan, BD Biosciences) of DNA fragmentation of propidium iodide–
stained nuclei as described previously (23). The percentage of specific
apoptosis was calculated as follows: 100  [experimental apoptosis (%)
spontaneous apoptosis (%)] / [100%
spontaneous apoptosis (%)].
Necrosis was determined by assessment of cell membrane integrity. Briefly,
cells were harvested, washed once with ice-cold PBS, incubated for 10 min
with a 5% propidium iodide solution, and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Untreated cells were used as a negative control, and cells treated for
12 h with 6% hydrogen peroxide (Mallinckrodt Baker) as a positive control.
Colony forming assay. Cells (10,000 or 20,000) were treated in
suspension at 37jC with TRAIL for 12 h or with doxorubicin for 1 h,
respectively, in the presence of either 20 Amol/L LY294002 or 0.2% DMSO
(as control) and were then seeded in a 55-cm2 tissue culture plate. Medium
was exchanged 24 h after seeding and colonies were stained after 15 to 20 d
with 0.75% crystal violet, 50% ethanol, 0.25% NaCl, and 1.57% formaldehyde.
Colonies (>50 cells) were counted and the percentage of surviving colonies
relative to solvent-treated controls was calculated.
Knockdown of PI3K and mTOR by RNA interference. Glioblastoma
cells were seeded at 0.2  105/cm2 in a 12-well tissue culture plate and
allowed to settle overnight. Cells were transfected with 60 pmol of PIK3CA

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (15). August 1, 2008

Stealth RNAi (PIK3CAHSS10800 4-6, Invitrogene), PIK3CB Stealth RNAi
(PIK3CAHSS10800 7-9, Invitrogene), mTOR1 SMARTpool siRNA (M-00300801, Dharmacon), or nontargeting control siRNA (D001206-13-20, Dharmacon) using TransMessenger transfection reagent (Qiagen) in a total volume
of 378 AL/well. Transfection medium was replaced by complete medium
after 3.5 h. Transfection was repeated the next day and cells were serum
starved overnight before they were treated for 48 h with TRAIL or
doxorubicin.
Western blot analysis. Western blot analysis was done as previously
described (23) using rabbit anti–phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody (1:1,000),
rabbit anti–phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser235/236) antibody (1:1,000),
rabbit anti–S6 ribosomal protein antibody (1:1,000), mouse anti–phosphoERK (Thr202/Tyr204) (E10) antibody (1:2,000), rabbit anti-mTOR antibody
(1:1,000), rabbit anti–PI3K p110a antibody (1:1,000; Cell Signaling), mouse
anti-Akt antibody (1:500; BD Bioscience), rabbit anti-ERK antibody (1:10,000;
Sigma), and rabbit anti–PI3K p110h antibody (1:500, Abcam), followed by
goat-anti-mouse IgG or goat-anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase (1:5,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Enhanced chemiluminescence was used for detection (Amersham Bioscience). Mouse anti–h-actin
antibody (1:5,000; Sigma) or mouse anti–a-tubulin antibody (1:3,000;
Calbiochem) was used as a loading control. All Western blots shown are
representative of at least two independent experiments. Densitometry
analysis was done using ImageJ (provided online by the NIH3).
Caspase activity. Caspase activity was determined using fluorimetric
substrates for caspase-3 (DEVD-R110; Roche Diagnostics), caspase-8 (IETDAFC; BioCat Inc.), caspase-9 (LEHD-AFC; Bachem), or caspase-2 (VDAVDAFC; Bachem) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Caspase
activity was measured with a 1420 Victor Multilabel Counter (Perkin-Elmer).
Determination of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release. To determine mitochondrial transmembrane potential,
cells were incubated with CMXRos (1 Amol/L; Molecular Probes) for 30 min
at 37jC and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytochrome c release
was determined in permeabilized cells using mouse anti–cytochrome c
monoclonal antibody (1:40; BD Biosciences) as previously described (26).
Confocal microscopy. To visualize mitochondria, cells were cultured in
the presence of 200 nmol/L MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes)
for 40 min before paraformaldehyde fixation, permeabilization, and
mounting, as previously described (27). Cells were stained with mouse
anti–cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (1:100; BD Biosciences), followed
by incubation with FITC-conjugated antimouse IgG (1:100; Chemicon
International), and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Leica DM IRB).
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was assessed by Student’s
t tests (two-tailed distribution, two-sample unequal variance).

Results
Sensitization of glioblastoma cells for death receptor– and
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis by PI3K inhibition. To
analyze the role of PI3K signaling in the regulation of apoptosis
in human glioblastoma, we selected from the glioblastoma cell
lines U87MG, U138MG, and A172, which express mutant PTEN and
exhibit relatively high constitutive Akt phosphorylation, as well as
LN18 and LN229 cells, which express wild-type PTEN and exhibit
relatively low constitutive Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, top). We
defined constitutive Akt phosphorylation, which was taken as a
surrogate for PI3K activity, as phosphorylation 24 hours after
complete serum deprivation because growth factors in the serum
are known to stimulate PI3K signaling (28). The low phosphorylation status of Akt under serum deprivation correlates with wildtype PTEN status in some cell lines (e.g., LN18 and LN229), but not
in others (e.g., U373MG and T98G), indicating that additional
factors besides PTEN are involved in the regulation of Akt

PI3K Inhibition Sensitizes Glioblastoma to Apoptosis

Figure 1. Sensitization of glioblastoma cells for death receptor–induced apoptosis by PI3K inhibition. A, activation of the PI3K pathway in glioblastoma cell lines.
Protein expression levels and phosphorylation status of Akt, S6 ribosomal protein, ERK, h-actin, and a-tubulin were analyzed by Western blotting in glioblastoma cell
lines cultured for 24 h in medium containing either 0% FCS ( ) or 10% FCS (+; top ) or treated with 20 Amol/L LY294002 for the indicated time points (bottom ).
The relative phosphorylation of Akt was densitometrically determined and is expressed in percent as phospho-Akt/Akt ratio, with the DMSO control set at 100%.
e, empty lane. h-Actin and a-tubulin served as loading controls. B, inhibition of PI3K sensitizes glioblastoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Glioblastoma cells were
pretreated or not with 20 Amol/L LY294002 for 1 h and then treated for 48 h with TRAIL in the presence (n) or absence (5) of 20 Amol/L LY294002. Apoptosis
was determined by FACS analysis of DNA fragmentation of propidium iodide–stained nuclei; the percentage of specific apoptosis is shown. Columns, mean of

of PI3K cooperates with TRAIL to suppress colony formation. Before seeding, cell suspensions were treated for 12 h with 20 Amol/L LY294002 (n) or DMSO (5) and/or

solvent-treated controls. Columns, mean of three independent experiments; bars, SE. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.001, comparing treatment with and without LY294002

for 1 h and then treated for 24 h (48 h for LN229) with anti-CD95 agonistic antibodies in the presence (n) or absence (5) of 20 Amol/L LY294002. Apoptosis was
determined by FACS analysis of DNA fragmentation of propidium iodide–stained nuclei; the percentage of specific apoptosis is shown. Columns, mean of three or two
(for LN18 and LN229) independent experiments done in triplicate; bars, SE. Apoptosis induced by LY294002 alone at 24 h: U87MG cells, 9%; A172 cells, 6%;
U138MG cells, 16%; LN18 cells, 21%; LN229 cells, 14% at 48 h. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.001, comparing treatment with and without LY294002 (Student’s t test).

phosphorylation (14). Initially, we used pharmacologic inhibitors of
PI3K to interfere with constitutive Akt activity (Fig. 1A, bottom).
Phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein, a surrogate readout for
mTOR activity, was also inhibited by LY294002 for a prolonged time
period of up to 48 hours, indicating that Akt and S6 ribosomal
protein are phosphorylated in a PI3K-dependent manner (Fig. 1A,
bottom). In U87MG cells, LY294002 also repressed phosphorylation
of ERK (Fig. 1A, bottom), a target of MEK, which can also be
activated as a consequence of interactions between the PI3K and
Raf/MEK/ERK pathways (16, 17), pointing to a cell line–specific
cross talk between the two signaling networks.
To explore the role of PI3K in the regulation of apoptosis, we
selected two prototypic classes of stimuli that are known to trigger
apoptosis via distinct pathways: death-inducing ligands that
stimulate the death receptor (extrinsic) pathway of apoptosis and
anticancer agents that activate the mitochondrial (intrinsic)

pathway. Inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 significantly enhanced
TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S1A). Calculation of combination
index revealed that the interaction between LY294002 and TRAIL to
trigger apoptosis is synergistic (Supplementary Table S2). To
further verify sensitization provided by PI3K inhibition, we used
wortmannin as an additional PI3K inhibitor, which also sensitized
glioblastoma cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) viability assay, which was used as another method
to monitor cytotoxicity, also showed that PI3K inhibition and
TRAIL acted in concert to reduce viability of glioblastoma cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). Moreover, we conducted clonogenic
assays to explore whether PI3K inhibition has an effect on longterm survival as well. Importantly, LY294002 cooperated with
TRAIL to suppress colony formation of glioblastoma cells

compared with either treatment alone (Fig. 1C). Besides TRAIL, we
extended our studies to CD95 as another death receptor system.
LY294002 also significantly increased CD95-induced apoptosis in a
synergistic fashion (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Table S2). This shows
that PI3K inhibition sensitizes glioblastoma cells to death
receptor–triggered apoptosis.
We then tested the effect of PI3K inhibition in combination with
anticancer drugs, prototypic stimuli that trigger apoptosis via the
mitochondrial pathway. LY294002 synergized with several chemotherapeutic drugs (i.e., doxorubicin, etoposide, and vincristine) to
induce apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2A and B;
Supplementary Fig. S2A). Interactions between LY294002 and
cytotoxic drugs were synergistic, as indicated by combination index
(Supplementary Table S2). LY294002 and doxorubicin also cooperated to reduce cell viability when cytotoxicity was assessed by an
MTT viability assay (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Furthermore,
LY294002 and doxorubicin acted in concert to suppress colony

formation of glioblastoma cells, showing that the combination
treatment was superior to either treatment alone in inhibiting
long-term survival (Fig. 2C). Together, this set of experiments
shows that PI3K inhibition primes glioblastoma cells for both death
receptor– and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In subsequent
experiments, we used TRAIL as a prototypic trigger of the extrinsic
apoptosis pathway and doxorubicin as a prototypic stimulus that
activates the intrinsic pathway.
Effect of mTOR inhibition on TRAIL- or doxorubicininduced apoptosis. Next, we blocked a downstream arm of the
PI3K network at the level of mTOR using pharmacologic inhibitors.
Control experiments confirmed that the mTOR inhibitor everolimus inhibited phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein (Fig. 3A,
top). Everolimus also decreased the expression levels of the S6
ribosomal protein (Fig. 3A, top), possibly due to inhibition of
protein translation. Furthermore, everolimus caused a transient
increase in Akt phosphorylation at 1 and 4 hours in U87MG cells

and rapamycin. Top, glioblastoma cells were incubated in medium containing 10% or 0% FCS for 24 h, with everolimus for 24 h at the indicated concentrations,
or with 100 nmol/L (U87MG) or 10 nmol/L everolimus (A172) at the indicated time points. Bottom, glioblastoma cells were treated with 100 nmol/L rapamycin, 10 nmol/L

activity, both everolimus and rapamycin failed to sensitize
glioblastoma cells to TRAIL- or doxorubicin-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 3B), whereas everolimus sensitized neuroblastoma cells to
apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, combining everolimus or rapamycin with LY294002 did not further increase

TRAIL- or doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis compared with
LY294002 alone (Fig. 3B). These findings indicate that mTOR
inhibition is not sufficient to restore the apoptosis sensitivity of
glioblastoma cells to TRAIL or doxorubicin.
Knockdown of PI3K, rather than of mTOR, sensitizes
glioblastoma cells to TRAIL- or doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.
In a genetic approach to interfere with aberrant PI3K signaling, we
knocked down individual components of the network by RNA
interference (RNAi). Transfection of glioblastoma cells with siRNA
against PI3K subunits p110a and p110h (individually or combined)
or mTOR1 led to selective down-regulation of the respective siRNA
targets and to a concomitant decrease in phosphorylation of Akt (in
case of p110a and/or p110h) or of S6 ribosomal protein (in case of
mTOR; Fig. 3C). Interestingly, knockdown of p110h, alone or in
combination with p110a, significantly increased TRAIL-induced
apoptosis compared with cells transfected with control siRNA,
whereas silencing of mTOR did not alter sensitivity to TRAILinduced apoptosis (Fig. 3D, left). Furthermore, knockdown of p110a
and p110h, individually or combined, but not knockdown of mTOR,
significantly enhanced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3D,
right). These findings indicate that both p110a and p110h are
involved in regulating doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, whereas
TRAIL-induced apoptosis is predominantly regulated by p110h.
This is in line with recent findings suggesting that p110a and p110h
have distinct, yet overlapping, functions. Whereas p110a was
reported to be the major isoform driving proliferation in glioblastoma (32), p110h was found to be a key regulator of apoptosis and
proliferation in endometrial carcinomas (33). Together, this set of
experiments shows that genetic silencing of PI3K, rather than of
mTOR, sensitizes glioblastoma cells to TRAIL- or doxorubicinmediated apoptosis.
Effect of mTOR inhibition on necrotic cell death. To explore
the possibility that mTOR inhibition sensitizes glioblastoma cells
to necrotic cell death, we assessed cell permeability by flow
cytometry. No significant changes in cell permeability were
observed on treatment with mTOR inhibitors alone or in
combination with TRAIL or doxorubicin (Fig. 4). Hydrogen
peroxide was used as a positive control for induction of necrosis
(Fig. 4). These findings indicate that mTOR inhibitors do not
enhance necrotic cell death on treatment with TRAIL or
doxorubicin in glioblastoma cells.
Inhibition of PI3K sensitizes glioblastoma cells to TRAIL- or
doxorubicin-induced caspase activation and mitochondrial
perturbations. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms
mediating apoptosis sensitization by PI3K inhibition, we used the
broad range caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk to test the requirement
of caspases. Apoptosis on treatment with LY294002 and TRAIL
or doxorubicin was almost completely blocked in the presence of
zVAD.fmk (Fig. 5A), showing that apoptosis was mediated by
caspases. Next, we monitored activation of the caspase cascade by
enzymatic caspase assays using fluorogenic caspase substrates.
Notably, LY294002 significantly increased TRAIL- or doxorubicininduced activation of caspase-2, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9
(Fig. 5B).
To investigate whether apoptosis sensitization by LY294002
involved the mitochondrial pathway, we analyzed parameters of
mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. LY294002 significantly
enhanced TRAIL-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and also cooperated with TRAIL or doxorubicin to induce
cytochrome c release from mitochondria (Fig. 5C). Confocal
microscopy studies confirmed that LY294002 acted in concert

with TRAIL or doxorubicin to trigger mitochondrial cytochrome c
release (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Fig. S4). This set of experiments
shows that PI3K inhibition sensitizes glioblastoma cells to TRAILor doxorubicin-induced caspase activation and mitochondrial
perturbations.
Inhibition of PI3K sensitizes primary cultured glioblastoma
cells to TRAIL- or doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Finally, to
validate the results obtained in established cell lines, we extended
our studies to primary cultured glioblastoma samples obtained
from surgical specimens. Control experiments showed that PI3K
inhibition by LY294002 caused inhibition of Akt phosphorylation
(Fig. 6A, top). Importantly, LY294002 significantly increased TRAILand doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and also cooperated with
TRAIL and doxorubicin to reduce viability of primary cultured
glioblastoma cells (Fig. 6B and C; Supplementary Fig. S5C and D).
By comparison, the mTOR inhibitors everolimus and rapamycin
did not significantly increase TRAIL- and doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis (Fig. 6D), although they inhibited the phosphorylation of
S6 ribosomal protein (Fig. 6A, bottom). This shows that PI3K
inhibition, but not mTOR inhibition, primes primary cultured,
patient-derived glioblastoma cells for TRAIL- or chemotherapyinduced apoptosis.

Discussion
Despite aggressive treatment strategies, patients with glioblastoma still have a dismal prognosis, which highlights the need for
novel treatment approaches (1). Aberrant signaling of PI3K, a key
mediator of cell survival signals, has been associated with
increasing tumor grade, decreased levels of apoptosis, and adverse
clinical outcome in human gliomas (20). Because most anticancer
therapies primarily act by inducing apoptosis in cancer cells,

resistance to current treatment protocols may be caused by defects
in apoptosis programs (e.g., abnormal activation of the PI3K
pathway; ref. 3). We therefore asked whether targeting this survival
cascade could be exploited to enhance the apoptosis sensitivity of
glioblastoma.
Targeting PI3K for apoptosis sensitization of glioblastoma.
Here, we report that inhibition of PI3K is an efficient strategy to
broadly sensitize glioblastoma cells to apoptosis induction, either
via the death receptor (extrinsic) apoptosis pathway or via the
mitochondrial (intrinsic) apoptosis pathway. This conclusion is

supported by several independent lines of evidence. First, PI3K
inhibition by LY294002 enhances apoptosis via a synergistic
interaction with death receptor stimulation or with chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin, etoposide, and vincristine, all of which
trigger the mitochondrial pathway. Second, the combination
treatment is superior to single agents in suppressing long-term
survival in clonogenic assays. Third, genetic silencing of PI3K
isoforms by RNAi also significantly enhances TRAIL- or doxorubicin-induced apoptosis similar to pharmacologic inhibitors. In
contrast, pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of mTOR fails to

enhance sensitivity to TRAIL- or doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis
despite target inhibition. Most importantly, inhibition of PI3K
primes primary cultured glioblastoma cells for TRAIL- or
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Together, these findings provide
convincing evidence that inhibition of PI3K is a promising
approach to lower the threshold for apoptosis induction by death
receptor triggering or cytotoxic drugs in glioblastoma.
There is currently much interest in therapeutic intervention of
aberrant PI3K signaling in glioblastoma because increased activity
of the PI3K pathway has been shown to correlate with its poor
prognosis (20). In neuroblastoma, we previously identified
activation of Akt as a novel indicator of poor outcome, which is
associated with apoptosis resistance (34). PI3K inhibitors as single
agents have recently been reported to exert cytostatic activity
against malignant glioma and to cooperate with blockade of

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (15). August 1, 2008

epidermal growth factor receptor in PTEN-mutant glioma (32, 35).
Although combinations with cytotoxic agents are of particular
interest because PI3K inhibitors were found to be primarily
cytostatic (35), there are thus far only few studies evaluating PI3K
inhibitors in combination protocols in glioblastoma. Our study is
the first to show that PI3K inhibition broadly sensitizes
glioblastoma cells, established cell lines as well as primary cultured
tumor samples, to apoptosis induction via the extrinsic and
intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Furthermore, we show that this effect
is not restricted to PTEN-mutant cells because wild-type PTEN
glioblastoma cells could be equally sensitized. Synergistic interaction of PI3K inhibitor occurs with several different chemotherapeutic drugs and is not restricted to antimicrotubule agents as
previously suggested (36). Thus, our findings have important
implications for the design of protocols combining PI3K inhibitors

PI3K Inhibition Sensitizes Glioblastoma to Apoptosis

together with conventional anticancer agents or experimental
therapeutics, such as TRAIL, to enhance the efficacy of TRAIL or
chemotherapy in glioblastoma. Moreover, restoration of sensitivity
toward TRAIL- or CD95-triggered apoptosis by PI3K inhibition may
contribute to effective tumor elimination via the innate or acquired
immune system because TRAIL is an effector molecule of the
innate immune response and an intact CD95 signaling system is
pivotal for effective killing of tumor cells by CTLs (37, 38).
Inhibition of PI3K is superior over mTOR inhibition for
apoptosis sensitization of glioblastoma. Another important
implication of our study relates to the question of which
component of the PI3K network presents the most suitable target
for apoptosis sensitization of glioblastoma. Our results, the first to
incorporate data from established glioblastoma cell lines and
primary patient material, show that PI3K inhibition is superior
over mTOR inhibition in increasing apoptosis sensitivity of
glioblastoma cells. In contrast to upstream inhibition of PI3K,
blockade of the mTOR arm by pharmacologic inhibitors or genetic
silencing consistently fails to augment apoptosis sensitivity on
treatment with TRAIL or doxorubicin despite mTOR inhibition.
The failure of mTOR inhibitors to efficiently prime glioblastoma
cells for apoptosis is unlikely to be simply due to feedback
activation of Akt by mTOR inhibitors, as previously reported for
these agents (29–31), because no additional sensitization for
TRAIL- or doxorubicin-induced apoptosis is seen with the
concomitant use of everolimus or rapamycin together with
LY294002 compared with treatment with LY294002 alone. In
addition, we found no evidence that mTOR inhibitors enhance
necrotic cell death on treatment with TRAIL or doxorubicin in the
glioblastoma cell lines investigated. Cell line or cell type, stimulus,
and the microenvironment may influence the susceptibility to
mTOR inhibitor–induced apoptosis because everolimus has been
shown to increase the therapeutic effects of irradiation or TRAIL in
glioblastoma cell lines or of cytotoxic drugs in non–small cell lung
carcinoma, head and neck cancer, or neuroblastoma (39–43). The
differential effect of PI3K versus mTOR inhibition on apoptosis
sensitivity found in our study may indicate that other arms of the

PI3K network, possibly, but not necessarily, independent of mTORmediated signaling, are involved in the control of apoptosis in
glioblastoma cells (e.g., via phosphorylation or transcriptional
modulation of cell death proteins). Furthermore, conceptually,
inhibition of the signaling apex, here the PI3K protein, may be a
more promising target to inhibit than a signal side arm of the
network. It will be the object of our further investigations to
identify the molecules mediating the sensitization effect of PI3K
inhibitors for apoptosis.
By showing that PI3K inhibition synergizes with chemotherapy
or death-inducing ligands to trigger apoptosis in glioblastoma cells,
our findings have important implication for apoptosis-based
therapy of glioblastoma. The antitumor activity of TRAIL may be
curtailed in many tumors, including glioblastoma, by primary or
acquired resistance to TRAIL, despite expression of both apoptosisinducing TRAIL receptors (44–46). Our findings argue for
combining PI3K inhibitors with TRAIL receptor agonists or
conventional chemotherapeutic agents to prime glioblastoma cells
for death receptor– or chemotherapy-induced cell death. Clinically,
resistance to apoptosis is a major cause of treatment failure in
glioblastoma (47). In terms of a clinical perspective, our findings
provide a basis for further investigation of PI3K inhibitors in
combination with TRAIL or chemotherapy to overcome apoptosis
resistance in glioblastoma.
