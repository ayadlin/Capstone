Abstract
We have previously discovered the naturally occurring
antitussive alkaloid noscapine as a tubulin-binding agent that
attenuates microtubule dynamics and arrests mammalian
cells at mitosis via activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
pathway. It is well established that the p53 protein plays a
crucial role in the control of tumor cell response to
chemotherapeutic agents and DNA-damaging agents; however, the relationship between p53-driven genes and drug
sensitivity remains controversial. In this study, we compared
chemosensitivity, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis on
noscapine treatment in four cell lines derived from the
colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells: p53+/+ (p53-wt), p53 /
(p53-null), p21 / (p21-null), and BAX / (BAX-null). Using
these isogenic variants, we investigated the roles of p53, BAX,
and p21 in the cellular response to treatment with noscapine.
Our results show that noscapine treatment increases the
expression of p53 over time in cells with wild-type p53 status.
This increase in p53 is associated with an increased apoptotic
BAX/Bcl-2 ratio consistent with increased sensitivity of these
cells to apoptotic stimuli. Conversely, loss of p53 and p21
alleles had a counter effect on both BAX and Bcl-2 expression and the p53-null and p21-null cells were significantly
resistant to the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of
noscapine. All but the p53-null cells displayed p53 protein
accumulation in a time-dependent manner on noscapine
treatment. Interestingly, despite increased levels of p53, p21null cells were resistant to apoptosis, suggesting a proapoptotic role of p21 and implying that p53 is a necessary but
not sufficient condition for noscapine-mediated apoptosis.

Introduction
Given the pivotal role of microtubules in biological processes
such as intracellular transport, motility, morphogenesis, and
mitotic spindle formation, treatment of cells with microtubuletargeting agents evokes activation of stress response pathways,
cell cycle arrest, and induction of apoptosis (1). This accounts for
the extensive use of microtubule-interfering agents in tumor chemotherapy. Typically, microtubule-interacting drugs (e.g., paclitaxel, Vinca alkaloids, etc.) alter microtubule dynamics and engage
the cell cycle surveillance mechanisms to arrest cell division in

mitosis. Many cancer cells possess genetic lesions in components
of this pathway and thus fail to arrest in mitosis. Therefore, by
targeting the spindle microtubules, chemotherapeutic agents can
efficiently block cell cycle progression in normal cells with intact
surveillance mechanisms while initiating programmed cell death in
certain tumors to inhibit their aggressive growth (2, 3). In recent
years, efforts have been devoted to elucidating signaling pathways
that mediate the biological activities of microtubule-interfering
agents (4).
It is becoming appreciated that the tumor suppressor protein
p53 serves as a key player in the cellular response to a variety of
extracellular and intracellular insults, such as DNA damage,
oncogenic activation, and microtubule disruption (5, 6), exerting
its function mainly through transcriptional activation of target
genes, such as the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21, for
arresting the cell cycle and the proapoptotic protein BAX for
inducing apoptosis (7, 8). Although drug-dependent microtubule
disruption results in the up-regulation of p53 expression, the
relationship between p53-driven genes and drug sensitivity remains
controversial as the response is drug and cell type dependent. This
is, in part, because not all drugs absolutely require p53 for their
apoptotic function (9–11). In some settings, p53 loss can enhance
drug-induced apoptotic cell death (12) and its loss correlates with
multidrug resistance in many tumor types (13). The observation
that this is a common defect in human tumors has spurred an
active search for strategies aimed at directly activating cell death
pathways downstream of p53. In this scenario, the role played by
p21 is particularly intriguing because this protein can be activated
by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms and can
assume proapoptotic or antiapoptotic functions, depending on the
cellular context (14).
Our laboratory has shown that noscapine, an opium alkaloid,
alters microtubule assembly dynamics, arrests cells at mitosis, and
causes apoptosis in many mammalian tumor cells (15). We have
also reported that halogenated analogues of noscapine, in
particular the brominated analogue, are f10- to 40-fold more
potent than noscapine (16). However, noscapine is further ahead in
clinical trials (phase I/II) and the halogenated analogues are still in
preclinical stages of development. Because the choice of most
chemotherapeutic regimens is usually based on tumor origin
without considering molecular determinants of drug sensitivity, we
thought it worthwhile to investigate at this stage the relationships
between drug sensitivity and various common cell cycle and
apoptosis controlling genes. These results are immediately helpful
in the clinic for accurately predicting the most effective drugs for
an individual patient.
We have previously shown that the apoptotic cell death on
noscapine treatment is accompanied by activation of c-Jun NH2terminal kinases (JNK; ref. 17). There is an increasing body of
evidence that points to an important role of JNK in coordinating
the cellular response to stress by phosphorylating the transcription

factors c-Jun and p53 (18, 19). We hypothesize that noscapinemediated suppression of microtubule dynamics entails an irremediable damage, which results in p53 activation followed by induction of apoptotic cell death. Because a study of the role of genetic
drug response determinants depends on the genetic context (20),
we used cells with a well-defined isogenic background. Here we
investigated the role of p53 and its two downstream effectors,
p21 and BAX, in determining chemosensitivity of the apoptotic
response on noscapine treatment in four isogenic variants of colon
carcinoma HCT116 cells. Our results indicate that although p53
may be a necessary prerequisite for noscapine-induced apoptosis,
it is not a sufficient condition for apoptosis. Our data point to an
important role of p21 induction to affect p53-mediated apoptosis
in colon adenocarcinoma cells on noscapine treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cells, viruses, plasmids, and reagents. The human colon cancer
cell lines HCT116 p53+/+ (p53-wt), p53 / (p53-null), p21 / (p21-null), and
BAX / (BAX-null) and the p21 plasmid construct pZL-WAF1 were gifts
from Dr. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; refs. 21,
22). All cells were maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine. Antibodies against
a-tubulin and h-actin were from Sigma-Aldrich. All other primary
antibodies against p53, p21, BAX, Bcl-2, and cyclin B1 were from Cell
Signaling (Beverly, MA). Secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Adenovirus-encoding wild-type p53 and
empty vectors were amplified in human embryonic kidney 293 cells using
the AdEasy system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).
Immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescence microscopy
was done as previously described (16). After drug treatment, HCT116 p53wt cells grown on poly-L-lysine–coated glass coverslips were fixed with cold
( 20jC) methanol, washed with PBS, and blocked with 2% bovine serum
albumin (BSA)/PBS. A mouse monoclonal antibody against a-tubulin
(DM1A; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was diluted 1:500 in 2% BSA/PBS and
incubated for 2 h at 37jC, followed by incubation with a 1:200 dilution of a

FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody at 37jC for 1 h.
Coverslips were then rinsed with 2% BSA/PBS and incubated with
propidium iodide (0.5 Ag/mL) for 15 min at room temperature before
mounting with Aquamount (Lerner Laboratories, Pittsburgh, PA) containing
0.01% 1,4-diazobicyclo(2,2,2)octane (Sigma), and then examined using
confocal microscopy.
In vitro cell proliferation and flow cytometric studies of cell
cycle and apoptosis. The cell proliferation assay in a standard 96-well plate
format using sulforhodamine B was done as previously described
(16, 23, 24). The cell cycle status was also evaluated as previously described
(23). Briefly, 2  106 cells were centrifuged, washed twice with ice-cold PBS,
and fixed in 70% ethanol. Cells were then washed again with PBS twice and
then incubated with propidium iodide (2 mg/mL) and RNase A (2 mg/mL)
in PBS for 45 min before analyses on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA). The apoptotic cells were also
quantified by flow cytometry using Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated Annexin V
(Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Eugene, OR).
Immunoblot analysis. Cells were then treated with 25 Amol/L
noscapine for 0, 12, 24, and 48 h. At the appropriate time points, cells
were lysed in 100 to 150 AL of lysis buffer containing freshly added protease
inhibitors (10 Ag/mL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 Ag/mL aprotinin,
and 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate). Protein concentration was
determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA). Samples containing 50 Ag of total cellular protein were subjected to
standard Western blotting analysis after SDS-PAGE. Positive antibody
reactions were visualized with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
secondary antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system
according to the protocol of the manufacturer.

Results
Sensitivity of human colon cancer cells to noscapine
depends on the p53/p21 status. We have previously shown that
noscapine arrests mammalian cells in mitosis despite the presence
of intact cellular microtubule arrays and targets them for apoptosis
(15). Furthermore, in contrast to other microtubule-interacting
agents such as paclitaxel, nocodazole, and vinblastine, noscapine

cells treated with 25 Amol/L noscapine for 0, 12, 24, and 48 h. Intact normal radial arrays of microtubules and typical characteristic cellular morphologies of
HCT116 cells are apparent at time 0 of treatment. As the time of noscapine treatment increases from 12 to 24 to 48 h, derangement of microtubule arrays (green ) is
evident. Mitotic figures begin to appear at 12 h and are abundant at 24 h. Forty-eight hours of treatment grossly perturbs the nuclear morphology as seen by the
formation of large multilobed nuclei and the appearance of small spheroids of DNA (red) fragments, indicative of apoptosis. B, noscapine inhibits proliferation of
HCT116 colon cancer cells. The percentage of cell proliferation at the indicated drug concentrations, compared with untreated cells, was measured by the standard
sulforhodamine B assay. The four cell lines (p53-wt, p53-null, p21-null, and BAX-null) were grown in 96-well formats and treated with gradient concentrations of
noscapine for 48 h. Plot of percent cell survival versus noscapine concentrations used for the determination of IC50 values. Points, average of three independent
experiments.

(p53-wt, p53-null, p21-null, and BAX-null) shown in a three-dimensional disposition. Cells were harvested for analysis at the noted hours, fixed and stained with
propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry [fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)] using the Cell Quest Software. X-axis, intensity of propidium iodide
fluorescence, which is indicative of the total DNA content of cells in different phases of the cell cycle. Y-axis, number of cells detected for a given DNA content. Z-axis,
time points (i.e., 0, 12, 24, and 48 h). Cells residing in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle are designated with 2N and cells in the G2 phase or in mitosis are designated
with 4N. Less than 2N DNA is indicative of hypodiploid or sub-G1 population, a diagnostic of apoptosis. As the arrested mitotic cells plummet from a peak at f12 h
in p53-wt cells, the number of apoptotic cells increases in concordance. The p53-wt cells show maximum sensitivity to noscapine treatment whereas the p53-null cells
are significantly resistant to the apoptotic effects of noscapine. The BAX-null cells showed an appreciable sub-G1 population. The p21-null cells also escape the effect
of the drug and do not succumb to apoptosis. Interestingly, they traverse continually through the cell cycle and result in an accumulation of a polyploid population.

attenuates microtubule dynamics without affecting the total
tubulin polymer mass in cells (25). We first examined the effect
of noscapine treatment over time on the spindle architecture and
nuclear morphology of HCT116 colon cancer cells. Figure 1A shows
representative confocal micrographs of HCT116 p53-wt cells
treated with 25 Amol/L noscapine for the indicated hours. Normal
radial arrays of interphase microtubules were seen at the start of
treatment (time 0). In 12-h noscapine-treated cells, microtubule
spindles, visualized by immunofluorescence staining of microtubules, looked abnormal and failed to assemble chromosomes at
the metaphase plate (Fig. 1A). Mitotic figures started to appear,
which showed both normal bipolar spindles and aberrant multipolar spindles, the latter we often observed in some cells. Some
mitotic figures clearly showed the presence of lagging chromosomes despite a bipolar mitotic apparatus. Mitotic figures peaked
at 24 h of treatment. After 48 h of drug treatment, fewer cells were
found arrested in mitosis and we observed abnormally large multinucleated cells. In addition, many cells with fragmented nuclei and
apoptotic morphologies were evident. In contrast, cells treated with
the vehicle (DMSO) showed normal mitoses with a bipolar spindle
apparatus and chromosomes congressing at the mid-plate followed
by cytokinesis (data not shown).
Next, we investigated if these spindle defects caused an
inhibition of the growth of HCT116 cells and its isogenic variants
on noscapine treatment using sulforhodamine B assay. Figure 1B

shows dose-response curves for the HCT116 cells (p53-wt, p53-null,
p21-null, and BAX-null) following a 48-h exposure to gradient
noscapine concentrations. The p53-wt cells were most sensitive
(IC50 value of 25 Amol/L) to the antiproliferative effects of
noscapine. In contrast, the p53-null cells were most resistant and
displayed an IC50 of 76 Amol/L. The IC50 value of noscapine for
p21-null cells was 63 Amol/L, which was also f2.5-fold higher than
that for the p53-wt cells, suggesting reduced chemosensitivity.
The BAX-null cells displayed an IC50 value of 33 Amol/L, which was
comparable to the wild-type cells. Thus, our results from the
growth inhibition experiments concluded that the p53, BAX, and
p21 status of colon cancer cells influences their sensitivity to
noscapine cytotoxicity.
Noscapine induces G2-M arrest and apoptosis in a p53/p21–
dependent manner. The induction of apoptosis is a major event in
tumor cell response to cytotoxic agents, including the tubulinbinding drugs (26). We have shown that the tubulin-binding agent
noscapine arrests cell cycle progression at the G2-M phase preceding apoptosis in mammalian cells (15, 17, 25). To investigate the
roles of p53 and p21 in the negative regulation of cellular growth on
noscapine treatment, isogenic variants of the HCT116 cells were
treated with 25 Amol/L noscapine and their cell cycle profiles were
analyzed at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h of treatment. Figure 2A shows the cell
cycle profile of all the four cell types on noscapine treatment over
time in a three-dimensional disposition. As can be seen in

p53 and p21 Determine Apoptosis in Colon Cancer Cells

Fig. 2A, mitotic figures in p53-wt cells reached a peak at f12 h,
accompanied by an emergence of sub-G1 (<2N DNA) population.
This sub-G1 population in p53-wt cells peaked to f52% at 48 h. The
p53-null cells, on the other hand, showed minimal sub-G1
population (f25%) even at 48 h of noscapine treatment despite
accumulation of cells in the G2-M phase at 24 h. Our results depict
that BAX-null cells showed a quite similar response as seen for p53wt cells. The BAX-null cells accumulated in the G2-M phase, peaking
at 12 h of noscapine treatment. At 24 h, we observed a significant
reduction of the G2-M cell population with a concomitant increase
of the sub-G1 population in BAX-null cells. This sub-G1 population
reached a maximum of f45% at 48 h of noscapine treatment,
suggesting a reasonably good apoptotic response in these cells. The
above findings are suggestive of an important role of p53 and of
BAX-independent pathways in noscapine-induced apoptosis.
The p21-null cells showed a time-dependent increase of G2-M
population up to 24 h of noscapine exposure. Interestingly, the p21null cells continued to traverse through the cell cycle and did not
exit mitoses but rather underwent multiple rounds of DNA synthesis, accumulating large amounts of DNA as evidenced by the
presence of a 16N polyploid peak at 48 h (Fig. 2A). The p21-null
cells showed f30% sub-G1 population at 48 h, which conforms to
the resistance of these cells to succumb to apoptosis. This reduction of apoptosis correlated with the reduced chemosensitivity to
noscapine shown by the high IC50 value in p21-null cells. The
progression of the entire cell cycle as a function of time in terms of
the percentage of G0-G1, S, G2-M, and sub-G1 populations in all
isogenic variants of HCT116 cells is shown in Table 1. Figure 2B is a
graphical representation of percent sub-G1 cells that are indicative
of apoptosis in all four cell types.
We next attempted to correlate the differences in sub-G1 population observed using cell cycle experiments with those obtained
from Annexin V staining of apoptotic cells in all four isogenic cell
types. Biochemically, the early apoptotic process is characterized
by loss of lipid asymmetry between the two leaflets of plasma
membrane, where phosphatidylserine translocates from the inner
leaflet and gets displayed on the outer leaflet. Using flow cytometry,
Alexa Fluor 488–labeled Annexin V was used to quantitate the
apoptotic population at 48 h of noscapine treatment in all four cell
types. Figure 2C shows a graphical representation of the percentage
of Annexin V–positive cells obtained from the four variants of
colon cancer cells treated with either the vehicle or noscapine for
48 h. The vehicle-treated cultures of all cell types contained very
few apoptotic cells as evident from Fig. 2C. On the other hand, cells
treated with noscapine for 48 h showed f58% (p53-wt), f30%
(p53-null), f49% (BAX-null), and f37% (p21-null) Annexinpositive cells. The extent of apoptosis as seen by Annexin V
staining in all four cell lines correlated with the extent of sub-G1
population obtained from cell cycle experiments.
Noscapine treatment alters levels of cell cycle and apoptosis
regulatory proteins. We next examined the effect of noscapine on
the expression of some cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory proteins
in all four isogenic HCT116 cell lines. The time-dependent effects of
exposure to 25 Amol/L noscapine on p53, BAX, Bcl-2, p21, and
cyclin B1 levels are shown in Fig. 3. In p53-wt cells, immunoblot
analysis showed distinctly elevated p53 levels as early as 12 h after
initiation of noscapine treatment. We further evaluated whether
the growth inhibitory effect of noscapine on colon cells with wildtype p53 status was associated with an up-regulation of p21, an
inhibitor of cyclin-CDK complexes involved in G1-G2 phase
progression (27). Following activation of p53, a significant increase

www.aacrjournals.org

in p21 expression over time was also detectable in p53-wt cells. The
elevated level of p21 indicated that the stabilized p53 protein was
transcriptionally active. The BAX gene, a proapoptotic member of
the Bcl-2 family, is an important target for p53. Our results from the
Western blot analysis (Fig. 3) showed a time-dependent elevation of
BAX protein level and a pronounced down-regulation of Bcl-2 on
noscapine treatment of p53-wt cells. The cyclin B1 levels increased
up to 12 h followed by a decline to almost negligible levels at 48 h in
p53-wt cells (Fig. 3). Because cyclin B1 plays a crucial role in
progression through mitosis of mammalian cells, our results were
in concordance with the mitotic activity of p53-wt cells over time
on noscapine treatment.
Conversely, loss of p53 by homologous deletion in p53-null cells
does not show any detectable levels of p21 and BAX proteins,
which are the direct downstream effectors of p53. Because BAX is
tightly regulated by p53, the absence of p53 results in lack of
detectable BAX levels. Although p21 is normally regulated by p53,
there is plenty of evidence of alternative p53-independent upregulation of p21 that is mostly dependent on the treatment type
(28). Noscapine treatment apparently does not induce the p53independent pathway of inducing p21 expression, and thus the lack
of detectable p21 levels. In p53-null cells, the levels of the Bcl-2
decreased drastically and transiently at 12 h of drug-treatment
before restoring back to the basal levels at 48 h of treatment
(Fig. 3). This restoration of Bcl-2 can partly be a reason for the
reduction of apoptotic response in p53-null cells as evidenced by
the minimal sub-G1 population and a severe reduction of Annexinpositive cells at 48 h. The cyclin B1 levels in p53-null cells were
slightly up-regulated at 12 h followed by a strong decline up to
48 h of noscapine exposure (Fig. 3).
In BAX-null cells, noscapine induced an accumulation of p53 and
p21 levels by 48 h (Fig. 3). These cells displayed drug sensitivity
despite the absence of BAX. The Bcl-2 levels also increased on
noscapine treatment in a time-dependent manner in BAX-null
cells. Our immunoblot results show that the cyclin B1 levels
inversely correlated with p21 levels in BAX-null cells (Fig. 3).
In p21-null cells, noscapine treatment did not have any change
in the BAX levels similar to p53 levels, which also did not change
over time except a slight increase at 48 h (Fig. 3). Although p21 is
not known to play a role in the regulation of BAX, the p21-null cells
are known to have high basal levels of p53 and BAX (29). They also
lack the G1-S checkpoint (30). The high levels of BAX could be due
to the high basal levels of p53 because BAX expression is tightly
regulated by p53. The Bcl-2 levels showed a time-dependent decrease following noscapine treatment (Fig. 3). Noscapine treatment
resulted in a cyclical behavior of cyclin B1 levels over time in
p21-null cells. Most importantly, despite the presence of p53, the
p21-null cells showed a significant reduction in percent sub-G1
population as depicted by cell cycle and Annexin staining experiments. Furthermore, p21-null cells had a higher IC50, showing
reduced sensitivity to noscapine treatment.
Reintroduction of p53 restores noscapine-induced apoptosis
in p53-null cells. Given the role of p53 in the induction of
apoptosis in response to suppression of microtubule dynamics by
noscapine, we investigated whether reintroduction of p53 in p53null cells would restore noscapine-induced apoptosis. Toward this
goal, we infected p53-null cells with an adenovirus encoding for p53
followed by a time-dependent exposure of noscapine to evaluate
whether restoration of p53 could enhance noscapine-induced
apoptosis in p53-null cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, there was a
complete restoration of the apoptotic effects of noscapine on

noscapine treated-infected p53-null cells was f48% as compared
with f27% in drug-treated, empty vector–infected p53-null cells

compared with f25% Annexin-positive cells in empty vector–

that observed in p53-wt cells. Immunoblot analysis of cell lysates of
adenovirus-infected p53-null cells showed a restoration of near
wild-type amounts of p53 at 0 h of treatment (Fig. 4D). Because
adenoviral promoters vary in their potency from one cell type to
another, we cannot really expect them to maintain wild-type steadystate levels of the proteins of interest studied. The significant p53
up-regulation at 12 h of noscapine treatment is clearly visible, which
then levels off. This perhaps might be due to the saturation of
regulated transcription levels of p53 on drug treatment among
many other reasons. Therefore, it is obvious that downstream genes
of p53, such as p21 and BAX, are also not sufficiently controlled by
reintroduced p53. Although the BAX expression was almost
unchanged over time of noscapine treatment, Bcl-2 was decreased
at 48 h of drug treatment in infected cells (Fig. 4D). The cyclin B1
levels remained unchanged until 24 h, but a slight decrease was
observed at 48 h (Fig. 4D). The empty vector–infected p53-null
controls did not show any expression for p53, BAX, and p21.
However, Bcl-2 levels showed a decrease at 12 h followed by an

increase at 24 and 48 h of noscapine treatment (Fig. 4D). Cyclin B1
expression in the empty vector–transfected p53-null cells increased
at 12 h followed by a decline up to 48 h of treatment (Fig. 4D).
Surprisingly, despite a little deviation in the protein levels as
compared with the wild-type scenario, a complete rescue of cell
cycle kinetics and apoptosis to full wild-type extent in p53 null cells
on reintroduction of p53 was observed (Fig. 4A–C).
p21 is necessary but not sufficient for p53-mediated
noscapine-induced apoptosis. The results above suggest an
important role of p21 in noscapine-mediated p53-dependent
apoptosis. Our hypothesis was that p53 induction might be a
necessary but not sufficient condition for causing apoptosis on
noscapine treatment. To test this hypothesis, we transfected p21-null
cells with a p21 plasmid construct and evaluated whether
reintroduction of p21 could enhance apoptosis in p21-null cells.
Our results showed that apoptotic response in these cells was
restored by the transfection of p21 gene into p21-null cells
thereby confirming the proapoptotic role of p21 on noscapine
treatment. The percentages of sub-G1 cells (Fig. 5A and B) and
Annexin-positive cells (Fig. 5C) were significantly higher in p21transfected p21-null cells as compared with the empty vector–
transfected p21-null cells (f51% versus f28% sub-G1 cells, f48%
versus 32% Annexin-positive cells). The immunoblot analysis
showed a progressive increase of p53 expression on noscapine
treatment of p21-transfected p21-null cells as well as the empty
vector–transfected p21-null cells (Fig. 5D). The Bcl-2 expression

declined over time of treatment in both the p21-transfected and
empty vector–transfected p21-null cells (Fig. 5D). The p21 levels in
the p21-transfected cells were significantly higher at 24 h of noscapine treatment (Fig. 5D). Our results suggest that an increased p21
expression is necessary for p53-mediated apoptosis on noscapine
treatment. These results thus identify molecular determinants of the
in vitro response to noscapine showing a role for the p53/p21 system
in the apoptotic response and provide evidence for a substantive
proapoptotic role of p21 in noscapine-induced apoptosis.
We next asked if p21 was sufficient to restore apoptosis in the
absence of p53 in p53-null cells. To address this, we transfected
p53-null cells with a p21 plasmid construct and measured the subG1 population by following the cell cycle of the transfected cells
over time. Our results showed that noscapine-induced apoptosis
was not restored by p21 alone in the absence of p53 (Fig. 6A). The
sub-G1 populations of the p21-transfected p53-null cells and empty
vector–transfected p53-null controls were comparable. Figure 6B
depicts a graphical representation of the percentage of sub-G1 cells
in the transfected and empty vector–transfected controls. This
result further strengthened that p21 alone is not sufficient; rather,
both p53 and p21 determine the sensitivity to noscapine-induced
apoptosis.

Discussion
Colorectal cancer is considered relatively resistant to chemotherapy, compared with other types of human malignancies such as
ovarian cancer and esophageal cancer (31). Thus, attempts at improving the survival of patients affected by this disease depend
largely on strategies targeting tumor cell resistance, which cannot be
rationally planned without a detailed knowledge of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. A current paradigm about
cancer chemotherapy indicates disabling of the intrinsic apoptotic
pathways as a key factor in the response of tumor cells to anticancer drugs (26, 32). Therefore, strategies aiming to reestablish the
capability of the cell to activate a cell death program are an active
area of research.
Epidemiologic data show that p53 is mutated in over half of all
human tumors (33). Among the remaining tumors, although wildtype p53 is expressed, the pathways of p53-mediated cell cycle
arrest or apoptosis are defective. In the clinic, the functional status
of p53 has been related to prognosis, progression, and therapeutic
response of tumors (34). All these characteristics make p53 an
important molecular target for tumor suppression and drug
development. Although it is well established that p53 is an
important mediator of apoptosis under some conditions, the

downstream effectors of the p53 pathway in the cell death process
are not completely known. Several p53-inducible genes have been
identified, including mdm-2 (35), GADD45 (36), BAX (7), and p21
(37, 38). Recent evidence suggests that, apart from inducing arrest,
p21 may participate in apoptosis in both p53-dependent and p53independent pathways (39, 40). p53-induced apoptosis results from
overlapping downstream pathways that both suppress mitogenic
and survival signaling and promote proapoptotic signaling. In this
context, p53 can up-regulate the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family
member BAX (7) and possibly transcriptionally repress the
antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (41). Therefore, p53-mediated upregulation of BAX and perhaps concomitant down-regulation of
Bcl-2 are pivotal in shifting the ratio of BAX/Bcl-2 in the cell and
ultimately favoring apoptosis.
The present study was designed to delineate the role of p53 and
its two downstream targets, p21 and BAX, in the response of
colorectal carcinoma cells to noscapine treatment. To achieve this
goal, we used isogenic variants of the HCT116 colon cancer cells
(i.e., p53-wt, p53-null, p21-null, and BAX-null cells). Treatment of

p53-wt cells with noscapine resulted in the maximum apoptotic
response whereas p53-null cells were most resistant to apoptosis.
This clearly agrees with the premise that because p53 is one of the
major regulators of apoptosis, expression of this tumor suppressor
sensitizes cells to apoptosis in response to stress, such as the
pharmacologic suppression of microtubule dynamics on noscapine
treatment. The accumulation of p53 is an early and critical step for
p53 activation. In our study, noscapine treatment resulted in p53
accumulation in a time-dependent manner accompanied by an
increase in the levels of its two well-studied transcriptional targets,
p21 and BAX. On the other hand, the p53-null cells displayed a loss
of the growth-inhibitory and apoptotic effects of noscapine,
indicating that the p53 gene plays a crucial role in mediating the
effects of noscapine. We also found an absence of p21 in p53-null
cells, suggesting that the lack of a functional p53 protein could lead
to loss of p21 protein levels in response to noscapine exposure.
This was also manifested in a pronounced reduction of apoptosis
in p53-null cells on noscapine treatment. Although our data
showed that G2-M arrest was a major characteristic of almost all

sufficient to restore apoptosis as seen by

population on p21 transfection.

cell types before they succumb to apoptosis, the inactivation of p21
in HCT116 cells resulted in a significant polyploid population on
noscapine exposure at 48 h. Moreover, p21-null cells that had intact
p53 offered a proapoptotic role of p21 because these cells not only
showed a higher IC50 value but also escaped apoptosis on
noscapine treatment. The current study thus suggests that p21
plays an important role in exerting the apoptotic activity of
noscapine in a p53-dependent manner.
Chemotherapeutic regimens including Adriamycin, etoposide,
cisplatinum, colcemid, and resveratrol induce distinct cellular
responses; however, absence of p21 favors apoptosis induction by
Adriamycin, etoposide, and colcemid. In our context, in the p53-wt
cells, noscapine stimulates p21 expression and induces apoptosis
in a p53-dependent manner, and the absence of p21 decreases
apoptosis. The apoptotic response is mediated, perhaps, through
the mitochondria and is accompanied by an alteration of the Bcl-2/
BAX ratio. An increasing ratio of BAX/Bcl-2 proteins thus plays an
important role in the induction of apoptosis by noscapine in p53-wt
cells. Furthermore, it is suggestive of involvement of a mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic process on noscapine treatment of p53-wt
cells. This was, however, not true in the case of BAX-null cells
because they showed a good apoptotic response, thereby suggesting BAX-independent cell death mechanisms. Although p53 status
alone may not be a predictor of chemosensitivity to noscapine, it is
apparent from this study that wild-type p53 in tumor tissues could
be at least one factor in predicting drug efficacy. The apoptotic

response, however, was greatly decreased in HCT116 lines with
homozygous knockout of p53. The ability of wild-type p53 to induce
apoptosis was restored in HCT116 cells that are null for p53 by
infection with adenoviral p53. Intriguingly, despite an increase in
p53 levels on noscapine treatment over time in p21-null cells, the
apoptotic response was significantly reduced. It was restored on
reintroduction of the p21 gene, thus showing that p53 is a necessary
but not sufficient condition for noscapine-induced apoptosis.
Nevertheless, the role of p21 in apoptosis is controversial. There is
much evidence that implicates p21 as an antiapoptotic factor
(42–46). On the other hand, its role as a proapoptotic factor is also
well documented (47–49). In summary, we have clearly shown, using
isogenic cell lines, that noscapine activates growth arrest and
apoptosis primarily via a p53-dependent pathway that necessarily
involves the function of p21 such that the abrogation of either
molecule confers a growth advantage to the cells.
