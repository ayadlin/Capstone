ABSTRACT
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is an aggressive cancer. Vitamin D
supplementation is getting popular due to its anti-tumor functions after conversion
to its active form, 1α,25(OH)2D. Here, we show that dietary supplementation with 6
IU/g of vitamin D greatly suppressed ICC initiation and progression without apparent
toxicity in a chemically induced rat model. Microarray analysis of rat ICC tissues
showed vitamin D supplementation modulated the expressions of several unique
genes, including lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), confirmed by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemical
(IHC) staining. Further, 53 of 80 human ICC specimens (66%) exhibited high LCN2
expression and LCN2 knockdown in SNU308 cells decreased cell growth and migration,
suggesting LCN2 be an oncogene in human ICC. As human ICC SNU1079 cells were
treated by 1α,25(OH)2D3, LCN2 expression and cell proliferation were attenuated.
The downregulation of LCN2 expression was blunted when vitamin D receptor (VDR)
was knocked down, implicating that the in vivo Lcn2 downregulation is a direct
consequence of vitamin D supplementation
Our results support the prevailing concept that vitamin D status is negatively
associated with cancer incidence and mortality and suggest LCN2 may be a potential
target against ICC. Further studies of application of vitamin D or its analogs against
ICC are warranted.

INTRODUCTION

human ICC progression histologically. Furthermore, the
tumor growth can be easily evaluated by a micro PET
for small animals [29]. In this report, we investigated the
effect of vitamin D supplementation with 2 IU/g and 6
IU/g vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) on ICC via the TAAinduced ICC animal model. The potential underlying
mechanisms were evaluated through cDNA microarray
analysis and the possibly responsible gene was further
verified in human ICC specimen and human ICC cell lines.

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), the second most
common malignancy in the liver after hepatocellular
carcinoma, originates from the epithelial lining of biliary
tract [1-3] with increasing incidence and mortality recently
[1-5]. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) originates
from the small bile ducts within the liver. The survival of
ICC is very poor in general and only surgical resection can
provide a cure in the case of early stage of disease [6-8],
which is rare due to the lack of early diagnostic methods.
For unresectable ICC [9], the prognosis is dismal with the
average survival of less than one year [10], attributable
to the resistance to traditional chemotherapy and
radiotherapy, Recently, target therapy has been shown to
have potential being a promising strategy against CCA[11,
12]. Collectively, clinicians face a stalemate to deal with
patients with advanced ICC. New therapeutic strategies to
deal with ICC are indeed urgently needed.
Vitamin D, originally known to modulate
calcium absorption and bone metabolism for nearly a
century, is now shown to have potent antiproliferation,
antiangiogenesis, anti-inflammation, pro-apoptosis,
pro-differentiation, and immune-regulation in many
cells through a cell- and tissue-specific manner [13-18].
Moreover, evidence associating vitamin D deficiency,
defined as serum 25(OH)D concentration less than 20 ng/
ml in human, with the increased incidence of prostate,
colon and breast cancers in a number of ecological and
epidemiological studies has been well documented
[19-22], although some studies have questioned their
association[23]. Vitamin D exerts its transcriptional
regulation through binding to vitamin D receptor (VDR),
which forms a hetorodimer with retinoid X receptor
(RXR), and binds to vitamin D response element (VDRE)
located in the promoter region of vitamin D responsive
genes to transactive gene expression [24, 25]. Since VDR
is present in almost all tissues studied, the application of
vitamin D as a new generation of tumor preventive and
therapeutic agents is plausible.
Regarding CCA, 1α,25(OH)2D, the active form of
vitamin D, has been shown to inhibit CCA cell growth in
vitro [26], and dysregulation of the local conversion of
25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the
hormonal form of vitamin D, may lead to enhanced CCA
[27]. Moreover, VDR expression has been demonstrated
in cultured CCA cell lines and CCA tissues, in which high
levels of expression were associated with good prognosis
of CCA [26]. These findings suggest that vitamin D
deserves further investigation against CCA. So far, no
study concerning the application of dietary vitamin D
supplementation against CCA in vivo has been published.
Previously we have established a thioacetamide
(TAA)-induced rat ICC model [28], in which the tumors
can be induced after feeding rats with TAA-containing
water for 20 weeks. The model successfully recapitulates

RESULTS
Measurement of body weight, serum calcium and
25(OH)D levels of rats
As described in the diagram shown in Fig. 1a,
animals were divided into three groups (N=7 per group)
and fed with a diet supplemented with no vitamin D3,
2 IU/g of vitamin D3, or 6 IU/g of vitamin D3 and kept
from exposure to ultraviolet radiation b (UVB) to prevent
endogenous vitamin D synthesis. Drinking water was
replaced with water containing 0.03% TAA beginning in
week 8.
The measurements of body weight, serum calcium
and serum 25(OH)D were performed in week 1, 4, 6,
11, 17, 23, 26, and 31 for diets added with no vitamin
D3 (-D), 2 IU/g (+2D) and 6 IU/g (+6D) vitamin D3
groups. No significant difference in body weight was
observed among the three groups (Fig. 1b). All animals
gained weight quickly until they drank TAA-containing
water, and the increase of their body weight became more
gradual afterward (Fig. 1b). Similarly, serum calcium
stayed relatively unchanged and no significant difference
was observed among the three groups during the entire
study period (Fig. 1c). However, the serum 25(OH)D
levels varied depending on the vitamin D3 amount in the
diets (Fig. 1d). It increased from 40±3 to 60-70 nmol/L by
week 4 and stayed in this range in the +6D group, whereas
it remained relatively constant at about 43±3 nmol/L in
the +2D group, and gradually declined from 40±3 to 26±4
nmol/L in the -D group.

Evaluation of tumor initiation and progression by
position emission tomography (PET) scanning
Previously, we have shown that ICC can be induced
in rats after drinking water containing 0.03% TAA for 20
weeks with a highly successful rate [28]. Weekly PET
scan began in the 20th week after the initiation of TAA
treatment. Figure 2a compares 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluro-Dglucose (FDG) images taken consecutively (1st to 6th scan)
for 6 weeks between the -D and +6D groups. The scanning
results from the 3 groups are summarized in Figure 2b.
In the 1st scan, no rat bearing tumors was detected in the

+6D group, while 2 and 4 rats were found bearing tumors
in the +2D and -D groups, respectively. In the 5th and 6th
scans, the +6D group had 3 rats with tumors, and +2D and
-D groups each had 6 animals with tumors. Due to the
limitation of micro PET to detect tumor with size < 2 mm
and the indistinguishable border between normal tissues
and invasive CCA, the standard tracer uptake value ratio
(SUVR, tumor to liver) was obtained to represent tumor
growth [29]. As shown in Figure 2c, the -D group had the
highest SUVR in the 1st scan which increased gradually
in the following scans during the study. The +2D group
also showed increased SUVR but with a lower magnitude
than the -D group. However, the SUVR for the +6D group
stayed relatively unchanged and was significantly lower
than the -D group in the 5th and 6th scans.

The potential mechanism involved in the vitamin
D-dependent anti-ICC actions was investigated by
microarray analyses using Rat OneArray® v1 to compare
the gene expression profiles in tumors from these three
groups of rats. As shown in Fig. 3a and 3b, vitamin D
supplementation did induce indistinct gene expression
profiles in vivo. (The methods and data analysis for
microarray were described in the supplementary materials
section). Among the downregulated genes, Lcn2 was found
to be the most suppressed by vitamin D supplementation
with a 38% and 50% reduction in expression, respectively,
in the tumors from +2D and +6D rats compared to the -D
rats (Table 1a and Supplemental Fig.S-1).

Evaluation of the effect of 1α, 25(OH)2D3 on LCN2
expression in SNU1079 cells

The downregulation of Lcn2 expression by vitamin
D supplementation in vivo as indicated by microarray
were confirmed by RT-qPCR (Fig. 3c) and IHC staining
(Fig. 3d and 3e), which showed that both of Lcn2 mRNA
and protein expressions were significantly reduced in ICC
tumors from +6D group compared to those from -D group.
We further examined 80 human ICC tissues and found
that 53 (66%) specimens exhibited high LCN2 expression
compared to the non-tumorous bile ducts (Supplemental
Fig S-2).

We next investigated whether human LCN2
expression was regulated by 1α,25(OH)2D3 and whether
the effect was mediated through VDR in SNU1079 cells.
Using RT-qPCR and western blot analyses, we found that
1α,25(OH)2D3 caused a dose-dependent downregulation of
LCN2 mRNA and protein expression in SNU1079 cells
with dramatic upregulation of CYP24 mRNA expression,
the most inducible gene expression by 1α,25(OH)2D3
(Fig. 4c and 4d). Furthermore, we showed that VDR
knockdown by shRNA blunted the 1α,25(OH)2D3dependent LCN2 mRNA downregulation (Fig. 4e). Given
that the added FBS in cell culture medium contained some
amount of 1α,25(OH)2D3, the higher LCN2 expression
in SNU-VDRsi cells than that of SNU-COLsi cells also
indicated the downregulation of LCN2 by 1α,25(OH)2D3
is VDR-mediated ( Fig 4e ).Consequently, we concluded
that LCN2 expression is regulated by 1α,25(OH)2D3 and is

DISCUSSION

Evaluation LCN2 effect on cell growth and
migration of SNU308 cells

CCA is a devastating disease with increasing
incidence and mortality in recent years and with very few
therapeutic options [3-5]. Since the active form of vitamin
D, 1α,25(OH)2D3 or calcitriol, has been well demonstrated
to be a pleiotropic hormone with a variety of anti-tumor
actions [17, 30], combined with the fact that vitamin D
deficiency has been associated with a number of cancers
incidence [22], we thus investigated whether vitamin
D supplementation could benefit the prevention of ICC
initiation and progression under the bleak background
of ICC treatment. Using microarray approach, a recent
publication reported that vitamin D supplementation to
normal subjects can affect many cancer related genes
[31], supporting the epidemiological findings that vitamin

To further determine LCN2 effect on human CCA
cells, we knockdowned LCN2 in another CCA cell
line, SNU308, and obtained SNU-COLsi cells (mock
knockdown SNU308 cells) and SNU-NGALsi cells (LCN2
knockdwon SNU308 cells)(Figure S-3). The cell doubling
time was calculated by two time points of cell number. The
cell doubling time was increased to 30.45 hours from 23.6
hours and the migration ability is significantly repressed in
SNU308 cells after LCN2 knockdown (Fig 4f).

D-deficiency may be associated with many forms of
cancer [22], and also suggests the importance of adequate
vitamin D nutrition in preventing cancers. Because of the
concern about the UV-induced skin cancers, humans have
not generated sufficient vitamin D from sunlight exposure
and increasingly depend on the dietary supplementation.
However, how much vitamin D do we really need to
prevent cancers is still unknown [32].
In this study, we showed that the rat serum 25(OH)
D level, the best index of vitamin D status, changed with
time depending on the contents of vitamin D in their
diets (Fig. 1d). As shown, supplementation with 6 IU/g
vitamin D3 increased the serum 25(OH)D to a much higher
level (about 50% increase), whereas there was a gradual
decline to vitamin D-deficient state in the -D animals.
There was no significant changes in serum 25(OH)D in
the +2D group fed with 2 IU/g vitamin D3 diet. In spite
of differences in serum 25(OH)D levels among the three
groups, there was no significant difference in their body
weight and serum calcium over the course of study (Fig.
1b and 1c). This observation, showing no adverse effects
on body weight and serum calcium, indeed indicates that
supplementation with 6 IU/g of vitamin D3 did not cause
unwanted side-effects even though they had serum 25(OH)
D higher than the normal range [33]. Furthermore, the lack
of increase in serum calcium in 6 IU/g group demonstrates
that any anti-ICC effects observed in this group are most
likely a direct consequence of vitamin D supplementation,
and not a secondary effect attributable to calcium [34, 35].
Our data, for the first time, clearly showed an
anti-ICC initiation and progression (Fig. 2a, b and c) by
supplementing animals with 6 IU/g of vitamin D3 which
also raised their serum 25(OH)D level to between 60 and
70 nmol/L (Fig. 1d) in this TAA-induced rat ICC model.
The tumor incidence and tumor progression in –D and
+2D groups are similar (Fig 2b&c), whereas +6D group
has significantly lower tumor incidence and progression
as compared to –D group (Fig. 2a, b, &c). Since the
vitamin D content in the regular rat chows which contain
2.2 IU/g vitamin D [33] is comparable to our special 2
IU/g diet, apparently, the normal level of vitamin D in
the diet or normal circulating level [33] of 25(OH)D may
not be sufficient for preventing ICC tumor initiation and
progression (Fig. 2a, b, &c). This finding is consistent with
a prevailing view that a higher level of dietary reference
intakes (DRI) than what is needed for bone health [36]
may be required for the prevention of cancers and other
chronic diseases[22, 32, 37].
Functional genomic analyses will probably have
multiple implications for candidate drug discovery against
targeted genes. At the present time, 408 upregulated and
230 downregulated genes have been identified as potential
vitamin D targets by the use of chromatin immuneprecipitation DNA sequencing (ChiP-seq) analysis [38].
Thus, to further understand the underlying mechanisms
whereby vitamin D exerts its chemopreventive and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chemotherapeutic effects on ICC, cDNA microarray was
conducted. By using the Rat OneArray® which covers
24,358 well-substantiated rat transcripts, we performed the
genome-wide mRNA microarray on ICC tumors from each
of the three groups under study. The arrays demonstrate a
unique expression profile pattern for the triplicate samples
from each group (Fig. 3a & b), indicating different vitamin
D supplementations did change the gene expression
profile. After a series of bioinformatical analyses [39]
(Please reference the supplemental material and method)
, we identified 21 and 16 genes which were significantly
upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in response
to vitamin D3 supplementation (Table 1a). Signal pathway
analysis showed the vitamin D-upregulated pathways
are mainly involved in fatty acid, bile acid, vitamin
A and drug metabolic pathways, whereas the vitamin
D-downregulated pathways include those responsible
for mTOR signaling pathway, glycosaminoglycan
biosynthesis, adhesion, tyrosine, vitamin A and fatty
acid metabolic pathways (Table 1b).These genes or
pathways might be used as targets for finding novel drug
for cholangiocarcinoma treatment, and be used in clinical
diagnosis in the future studies.
Among the downregulated genes found in our
microarray analysis, LCN2 was found to be the most
suppressed by vitamin D supplementation. The results
of IHC staining and RT-qPCR of TAA-induced rat ICC
tissues confirmed the microarray data (Fig 3c,d,&e).
LCN2, a member of lipocalin family that transports small,
hydrophobic ligands, is a 25-kDa glycoprotein originally
isolated from human neutrophils, therefore, it is commonly
known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin
(NGAL) [40]. The protein is also known as neu-related
lipocalin, aka SIP24, oncogene 24p3, uterocalin and
siderocalin [40]. It is expressed in several normal tissues
where its roles are mainly to protect against bacterial
infection and oxidative stress [41]. LCN2 expression is
dysregulated in some benign and malignant diseases, and
has been shown to play multifaceted roles in cancer in a
cell lineage specific manner [42]. In malignant cells, its
functions may include inhibiting apoptosis, promoting
invasion and angiogenesis, and increasing proliferation
and metastasis. The levels of LCN2 have also been shown
to be elevated by several orders of magnitude during
injury, infection and malignancy, indicating a role it may
play in tumor development [41, 42].
Regarding cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a study
reported that LCN2 expression was detected in the CCA
cell line, HuCCA-1, but not in 4 hepatocellular carcinoma
cell lines, HepG2, HCC-S102, SK-Hep-1, and Alexander,
suggesting the expression might be specific to CCA [43].
It has also been found that serum LCN2 levels were
significantly elevated in ICC patients compared to those
with benign biliary tract disease [44]. In a separate study,
no significant differences were found in sera between
malignant and benign biliary patients, whereas elevated
3856

Oncotarget

LCN2 levels were detected in bile collected from the
ICC patients [45]. Moreover, the roles of LCN2 in ICC
have been studied by knocking down LCN2 with siRNA
that resulted in a significant reduction in invasiveness,
migration and pro-MMP-9 activity of ICC cells [46].
To further verify LCN2 role in human ICC, we
examined 80 human ICC specimen and 66% of human
ICC specimen presented with high expression LCN2,
adding the finding that knockdown of LCN2 in SNU308
cells decreased cell growth and migration (Fig 4f),
indicating the LCN2 plays as an oncogene in human
ICC. In addition, as application of 1α,25(OH)2D3 to treat
human ICC SNU1079 cells, which express VDR ( Fig. 4a
), a dose dependent antiproliferation and downregulation
of LCN2 mRNA and protein expressions was observed
(Fig.4b,c,&d). Of note, as most cancer cells respond
to 10-8M 1α,25(OH)2D3 [17], 10-10M 1α,25(OH)2D3
significantly inhibited SNU1079 cell growth (Fig 4b),
implicating the much more sensitivity of SNU1079
cells to 1α,25(OH)2D3 as compared to other cancer cells.
Since 1α,25(OH)2D3 exerts its genomic function through
binding with VDR, we next knocked down VDR in
SNU1079 cells and the inhibition of LCN2 expression
by 1α,25(OH)2D3 was attenuated ( Fig. 4e ), indicating
this effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 is VDR-dependent, which is
also supported by the finding that the SNU-VDRsi cells
presented with higher LCN2 expression as compared
to that of SNU-COLsi cells since the added FBS in cell
culture medium contained some amount of 1 α,25(OH)2D3
( Fig 4e ). These finding further suggested that the in vivo
downregulation of LCN2 in this current animal model is
the direct consequence of vitamin D supplementation.
Collectively, we concluded that LCN2 is an
oncogene in human ICC and its expression is repressed
by 1α,25(OH)2D3 VDR-dependently. Thus, the
downregulation of Lcn2 in rats ICC tissues is supposed
to be a direct sequence by vitamin D supplementation,
leading to the observed in vivo anti-ICC tumorgenesis.
Our present results are consistent with previous studies
suggesting that 1α,25(OH)2D3 and its analogs are able to
inhibit ICC tumor growth in vitro and in vivo [47-49].
In summary, we demonstrated in this report that
vitamin D in a form of dietary supplementation can
prevent and suppress ICC tumorigenesis and progression
with downregulation of LCN2 in an animal model without
inducing hypercalcemia. Furthermore, the results showing
that the high expression of LCN2 in human ICC specimen,
the decreased proliferation and migration of SNU308
cells after LCN2 knockdown, and the 1α,25(OH)2D3induced antiproliferative effect and VDR-dependent
downregulation of LCN2 in SNU1079 cells, strongly
suggest LCN2 may be a new target against human CCA.
Thus, based on our results, we concluded that maintaining
adequate vitamin D status has the potential to be an
inexpensive and effective approach against ICC. Further
investigations to determine the optimal amounts of

vitamin D supplementation required for cancer prevention
and the application of vitamin D and its D analogs for the
treatment of ICC are warranted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Induction of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
(ICC) in rats
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighting 250 ± 14
g were obtained from BioLasco Taiwan Co., Ltd (Taipei,
Taiwan). Animals were divided into three groups (N=7 per
group) and fed with a diet supplemented with no vitamin
D3 (cat. # 5A0E), 2 IU/g of vitamin D3 (cat.# 5A0G), or
6 IU/g of vitamin D3 (cat. # 5A0J) obtained from TestDiet
(Richmond, IN, USA). Animals were housed in an animal
room with a 12-hour incandescence light and dark cycle
at an ambient temperature of 22oC with food and water
available ad libitum, and avoid of any natural sunlight
and fluorescence lighting during the course of study. The
animal protocol was approved by the Experimental Animal
Ethics Committee of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital
(Approval: IACUC 2011081901) Beginning in week 8,
drinking water was replaced with water containing 0.03%
TAA.

Measurements of body weight, serum calcium and
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
Measurement of body weight and blood drawing
for calcium and 25(OH)D analyses were taken upon
the arrival of animals and in week 4, 6, 11, 17, 23, 26,
and 31. Serum calcium and serum 25(OH)D were
analyzed using kits obtained from Stanbio Laboratory
(CALCIUM LIQUICOLOR® (ARSENAZO) (#0155225, Stanbio Laboratory, TX, USA)) and from DiaSorin
(25-Hydroxyvitamin D 125I RIA kit (#68100E, DiaSorin,
MN, USA)), respectively. The calcium kit has intraand inter-assay coefficient of variation of 0.7 and 0.9%,
respectively. The 25(OH)D assay kit has intra- and
inter-assay cv of 8.2 and 10.5%, respectively. The limit
of detection is 1.5 ng/ml for 25(OH)D and 1mg/dl for
calcium.

Detection of TAA-induced ICC tumors by position
emission tomography (PET) and histopathological
evaluation of the liver
The detection of ICC tumors was accomplished by
injecting 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) 90
minutes prior to PET scan which was performed on an
InveonTM system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Inc. USA)
located in the Molecular Image Center of Chang Gung
3857

Oncotarget

Memorial Hospital as described previously [29]. Scan
was carried out once a week for six consecutive weeks
beginning in the 20th week after the addition of TAA into
the drinking water. Quantification of 18F-FDG uptakes
in the biggest liver tumor and normal liver tissue was
performed by calculating the standardized uptake value
(SUV) as previously described [29].

the Superscript III preamplification system (Invitrogen).
FAM dye-labeled TaqMan MGB probes and PCR
primers for human LCN2 (HS00194353-m1), CYP24A1
(HS00167999-m1), and VDR (HS01045844-m1) were
purchased from Applied Biosystems. For the internal
positive control, GAPDH (HS99999905-m1) was used
with a FAM reporter dye-labeled TaqMan MGB probe.
Mean cycle threshold (Ct) values for LCN2, CYP24A1,
and VDR were normalized against the GAPDH control
probe to calculate ∆Ct values using StepOne software v2.0
(Applied Biosystems).

Microarray analysis of ICC
Three TAA induced cholangiocarcinoma samples
from each group of rats fed with a diet supplemented with
no vitamin D, 2 IU/g vitamin D3 or 6 IU/g vitamin D3
were used for microarray analysis. Rat OneArray® v1
(Phalanx Biotech Group, Hsinchu, Taiwan) was chosen
for its reproducibility in examining the quantitative and
qualitative expression of most genes in the rat genome.
Following a quantitative scan of a chip, the images were
transformed to text files containing intensity information
by Phalanx® and the microarray data were analyzed by
using the GeneSpring® GX 7.3.1 Software (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The further
descriptions were shown in supplementary materials.

Knockdown of LCN2 in human ICC SNU308 cells
SNU308 cells were transducted with control small
hairpin RNA lentiviral particles (Sc-10808-V, Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) or NGAL small hairpin RNA lentiviral
particles (Sc-43969-V, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two days
after transduction, the cells (SNU-COLsi and SNUNGALsi) were selected by incubation with 10 μg/ml
puromycin dihydrochloride for another 3 generations.

Real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) and western blot
analysis of rat tumors

Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of rat and
human ICC tissues for LCN2

Total RNA extraction and RT-qPCR ( Lcn2 primer:
All-in-One™ qPCR Primer, #RQP052324, GeneCopoeia,
Rockville, MD, U.S.A.) were performed as described in
the previous section. The procedures for protein extraction,
blocking, and detection for western blot were performed
as the manufacture guideline. The primary antibodies used
in this study were LCN2 polyclonal antibody (#PAB9543,
1:1000, Abnova Corporation, Taipei, Taiwan). The
secondary antibodies were Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L)
HRP Antibody (#3053-1, 1:10000, Epitomics, CA, USA).

Human ICC tumors were obtained from patients
admitted to the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The
protocol was approved by the IRB of the Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital (Approval: IRB 99-2886B). The
detailed procedures were dercribed in the supplemental
material section.

Cell culture
SNU1079 cells and SNU308 cells were obtained
from Korean Cell Line Bank (KCLB: 28 Yongon-dong,
Chongno-gu, Seoul 110-744, Korea). Cells were grown
on RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
1% antibiotic-antimycotic agents. Culture medium was
changed 3 times per week.

Cell proliferation assay by WST-1 kit
SNU1079 cells were plated at about 1,000 cells
per cm2 in a Costar® 48 Well Clear TC-Treated Multiple
Well Plates (#3548, Corning Incorporated, NY, USA). The
cells were treated with ethanol vehicle (control group) or
1α,25(OH)2D3 at the indicated concentrations. The viable
cells were measured by Cell Proliferation Reagent WST1 (#11 644 807 001, Roche Diagnostrics, Mannheim,
Germany).

Knockdown of VDR and real-time qPCR of LCN2
expression in Human ICC SNU1079 cells
SNU1079 cells were transduced with control
non-target shRNA lentiviral particles (SI-SHC002V,
Sigma, MO, USA) or vitamin D receptor (VDR) shRNA
lentiviral particles (SI-NM_000376.1-578s1, Sigma).
Four days after transduction, the cells (SNU-COLsi and
SNU-VDRsi) were treated with 10-7 M of 1α,25(OH)2D3
or control vehicle for 24 hours. Total RNA was isolated
using the Trizol reagent, and cDNA was synthesized using
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Trans-well filter migration assay
SNU-COLsi and SNU-NGALsi cells were seeded
on each trans-well filter with 8.0-μm pores (Costar,
Cambridge, MA, USA). The upper chamber was filled
with 250 μl serum-free DMEM and the lower chamber
3858

Oncotarget

was filled with 600 μl DMEM with 10% FBS. These cells
were allowed to migrate at 37°C in an atmosphere of 95%
air-5% CO2 for 16 h. Cells that migrated through the pores
were stained with Liu’s stain and washed with 1xPBS
twice. Then the cells on the lower surface of the filter
were counted under four random high-power microscopic
fields (HPF;100X) per filter, and the mean number of cells
that migrated through the filter was calculated for each
condition. The experiments were performed in triplicates.

Statistical analysis
OneWay ANOVA with Post Hoc test was used for
the statistical analysis of SUV for 18F-FDG uptakes among
the three treatment groups during PET scanning. For
human LCN2 IHC staining comparison, the differences
among the three groups were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis
test, whereas the difference between each two groups
were analyzed by Dunn’s Multiple Comparison Test.
The Student t-test was used for the statistic analyses of
serum calcium, serum 25(OH)D, body weight and in vitro
experiments. P-value<0.05 was considered as a significant
difference. The program of Excel 2007 or SPSS statistical
software for Windows (SPSS version 10.0, Chicago, IL,
USA) were employed to conduct statistical analysis.
