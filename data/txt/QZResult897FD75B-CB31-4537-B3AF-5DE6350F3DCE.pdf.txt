Abstract
p23 is a heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) cochaperone located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus that stabilizes unliganded steroid receptors, controls the catalytic activity of certain kinases, regulates protein-DNA
dynamics, and is upregulated in several cancers. We had previously shown that p23-overexpressing MCF-7
cells (MCF-7+p23) exhibit increased invasion without affecting the estrogen-dependent proliferative response,
which suggests that p23 differentially regulates genes controlling processes linked to breast tumor metastasis.
To gain a comprehensive view of the effects of p23 on estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent and -independent
gene expression, we profiled mRNA expression from control versus MCF-7+p23 cells in the absence and
presence of estrogen. A number of p23-sensitive target genes involved in metastasis and drug resistance were
identified. Most striking is that many of these genes are also misregulated in invasive breast cancers, including
PMP22, ABCC3, AGR2, Sox3, TM4SF1, and p8 (NUPR1). Upregulation of the ATP-dependent transporter ABCC3
by p23 conferred resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents etoposide and doxorubicin in MCF-7+p23 cells.
MCF-7+p23 cells also displayed higher levels of activated Akt and an expanded phosphoproteome relative to
control cells, suggesting that elevated p23 also enhances cytoplasmic signaling pathways. For breast cancer
patients, tumor stage together with high cytoplasmic p23 expression more accurately predicted disease recurrence and mortality than did stage alone. High nuclear p23 was found to be associated with high cytoplasmic
p23, therefore both may promote tumor progression and poor prognosis by increasing metastatic potential
and drug resistance in breast cancer patients. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8446–56. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
p23 is a ubiquitous and evolutionarily conserved protein
first characterized as a component of unliganded progesterone receptor complexes (1, 2). p23 acts as a cochaperone,
stabilizing the ATP-bound form of heat shock protein
90 (Hsp90), thereby stabilizing Hsp90 interactions with
steroid receptors (3) and assisting Hsp90 in increasing the
hormone-binding affinities of many steroid receptors (4–6).

p23 is required for survival in mammals because p23-null
mice die perinatally and fail to undergo proper lung development due in part to decreased activity of the glucocorticoid
receptor (7). p23 regulates steroid receptors and telomerase
recruitment to DNA (8–11), and stabilizes some kinases,
including PKR, FAK-2, Flt3, and Raf (12–15). In addition to
Hsp90-dependent events, p23 might also regulate client proteins autonomously via its innate chaperone activity (16).
There is also evidence that mammalian p23 is a cytoplasmic
prostaglandin E synthetase (17), although this function is
controversial because p23 knockout mice do not exhibit
reduced prostaglandin E synthetase activity (18).
p23 has many implicated roles in cancer. We have previously shown that p23 overexpression increases ligand
binding to the estrogen receptor α (ER) and enhances ERdependent transcriptional activation (19, 20). We have also
shown that p23 overexpression in human ER-positive MCF-7
breast cancer cells promotes a transition from noninvasive
into migratory and invasive cells, without affecting cell proliferation (10). Mechanistically, p23 selectively increases ERtarget gene transcription and ER recruitment to the estrogen
response element (ERE) of the metastasis-associated gene
TFF1 (pS2), rather than to that of proliferative genes like
c-myc (10).

Effects of p23 on Tumor Progression in Breast Cancer

p23 protein expression increases with breast tumor stage
(10) and is upregulated in metastatic cancers (21, 22). p23
also regulates the binding and activity of the oncoprotein
telomerase (11, 23, 24), known to impact both early and late
stages of tumorigenesis, including epithelial cell transformation (25), human mammary epithelial cell immortalization (26), and metastasis in ER-negative breast cancer cells
(27, 28). In addition, p23 desensitizes mammalian cells to
treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor and chemotherapeutic
agent geldanamycin, thereby protecting Hsp90 from geldanamycin inhibition and stabilizing Hsp90 client oncoproteins (15).
Given the implicated role of p23 in cancer and the fact that
a modest increase in p23 protein expression causes such
strong estrogen-dependent and -independent transcriptional
and functional effects on migration and invasion in MCF-7
cells (10), we further characterized the effect of p23 on global
gene expression in MCF-7 cells, and examined the expression
of p23 protein in primary tumor samples with appended outcome data from women with breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
MCF-7 control and p23-overexpressing MCF-7 cells
(MCF-7+p23) were cultured and hormone-starved as previously described (10). A single MCF-7+p23 overexpressing
clone (clone 7) was used in the experiments. Validation of
selected p23-sensitive genes was performed using an independent, previously described MCF-7+p23 clone (clone 8)
with similar results (Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 10).
Microarray analysis
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) from
MCF-7 control and MCF-7+p23 cells treated 16 hours with
either ethanol vehicle or 1 nmol/L 17-β-estradiol (E2). Total
RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA and in vitro
transcribed to cRNA. The cRNA was fragmented, labeled,
hybridized to the human U133A 2.0 Affymetrix GeneChip,
washed, and scanned. Data are representative of four different conditions performed in duplicate (a total of eight)
and normalized using Robust Multichip Average Express.
The primary data were analyzed using MultiExperiment
Viewer to determine hierarchical clustering, and the ANOVA
test was performed on each of the conditions to find those
probe sets that were considered significant (P < 0.05). Genes
were considered significant if they passed the ANOVA test
and displayed a fold-change of >2.0 when the logarithmic
values in MCF-7+p23 and control cells were compared. The
L2L online microarray data analysis tool (http://depts.
washington.edu/l2l/) was used to analyze the gene sets for
gene ontology.
RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR
Cells were incubated in the absence (ethanol vehicle) or
presence of 1 nmol/L E2 or 100 nmol/L 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen
(TAM) for 16 hours before harvesting. Total RNA from MCF-7

www.aacrjournals.org

control and MCF-7+p23 cells was extracted with TRIzol
(Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. cDNA was
synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using the Superscript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primer hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's
instructions. cDNAs were amplified with the SYBR Green
Taq Ready Mix (USB) or Fast Start Universal SYBR Master
Mix (Roche) using MyiQ Single-Color Real-Time PCR Detection System from Bio-Rad. The primers used for quantitative
real-time PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments
Cells were hormone-starved for 3 days and treated with
the ethanol vehicle or 10 nmol/L E2 for 45 minutes and then
formaldehyde cross-linked, lysed, washed, and pelleted prior
to sonication according to methods described (10). Sonication of chromatin, preparation of protein A beads, immunoprecipitation of chromatin, and semiquantitative PCR were
modified from methods described (29). Chromatin (125 μg)
was subjected to immunoprecipitation with 6 μg ER antibody
(HC20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 2 μg acetyl-histone H3K9/14 antibody (Millipore, Inc.), or equivalent amount of
rabbit IgG (I-8140, Sigma). Following cross-link reversal,
DNA was purified using Qiagen PCR purification kit. Primers
used for PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S2.
RNA interference
ON-TARGET plus Non-Targeting (D-001810-10-05), ER
(L-003401-00-0005), and ABCC3 (L-007312-00-0005) SMART
pool siRNA were purchased from Thermo Scientific. Prior
to the siER and siABCC3 RNA transfections, cells were
hormone-starved for 1 and 3 days, respectively. Cells were
transfected using oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. For ER RNA interference
(RNAi) experiments, RNA and protein were isolated 36 hours
after the transfection. mRNA expression levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR, and protein levels were
analyzed following extraction from cells using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (10) and immunoblotting using
antibodies for ER (1:1,000; HC20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
α-tubulin (1:2,000; MMS-489P, Covance), and p23 (1:2,000; JJ3;
MA3-414, Thermo Fisher). For ABCC3 RNAi experiments,
24 hours posttransfection cells were dissociated using
Versene-EDTA and plated at the same density. Two days
after plating, cells were treated for 24 hours with 100 ng/mL
doxorubicin. Percent survival was determined by cell counting wells in each condition. RNA was extracted from the
untreated cells and knockdown of ABCC3 mRNA expression
was confirmed.
Chemotherapeutic resistance assays
Cells were hormone-starved for three days. Media were
supplemented with 0.01 to 1 μg/mL doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin; D1515, Sigma), 0.02 to 20 μmol/L etoposide
(E1383, Sigma), or 0.04 to 40 μmol/L camptothecin (C9911,
Sigma) for 48 hours and percent survival was determined
in quadruplicate for each condition using the sulphorhodamine B assay (30).

Immunohistochemistry and tissue
microarray analysis
Tissue arrays contained tissue specimens from individuals
who had undergone surgical removal of breast tumors at
Ludwig Cancer Center in São Paulo, Brazil, between 1983
and 1993 with a 12-year follow up. Representative tissue
cores 0.6 mm in diameter were extracted from each specimen and mounted in paraffin blocks and stained for p23
(JJ3; MA3-414, Thermo Fisher). Two board-certified pathologists scored the specimens from the breast tissue microarray
in a blinded fashion. Each was scored for intensity of staining
(0–3) in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm. For intensity
scores, no staining above background was scored as 0, weak
but convincing staining as 1, moderate staining as 2, and
strong staining as 3. Spearman correlation coefficients were
used to determine associations between variables. Age and
disease characteristics were compared between cytoplasmic
p23 levels using χ2 tests, t-tests, and Fisher's exact test.
Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were developed to predict recurrence or mortality. Models were selected using stepwise procedures in SAS with
differences in the likelihood ratio test statistics as the criteria
for model selection.

Results
Higher p23 protein levels cause changes in gene
expression in MCF-7 cells that are also observed
in invasive breast cancers
Our previous study showed that a small increase in the
amount of p23 protein expression caused specific estrogendependent and -independent changes in MCF-7 cell gene
expression and function favoring tumor progression (10).
We profiled genes globally regulated by p23 using Affymetrix
microarray technology (Fig. 1A) on RNA extracted from
hormone-starved control or MCF-7 cells stably expressing
2-fold more p23 protein (MCF-7+p23; ref. 10). The analysis
identified 359 known human genes sensitive to p23 levels
in the absence of estrogen treatment. Of these genes, 179
were upregulated and 180 were downregulated by >2-fold
(genes and corresponding probe sets are listed in Supplementary Tables S5 and S6).
In fact, 50% of the genes most upregulated and 61% of the
genes most downregulated by p23 overexpression (i.e., those
genes exhibiting >5-fold changes in expression between
MCF-7-control and MCF-7+p23 cells in the microarray) were
also misregulated in invasive breast cancers (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Many of these genes were validated, including
PMP22, AGR2, and ABCC3 (upregulated in the microarray
23.7-fold, 5.2-fold, and 5.1-fold, respectively, in MCF-7+p23
cells) and p8/NUPR1, TM4SF1, and Sox3 (downregulated
14.2-fold, 9.2-fold, and 7.9-fold, respectively) from independent MCF-7+p23 lines (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1).
PMP22 is an integral membrane protein known to play a role
in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in multiple cell types,
and is implicated in hereditary human neuropathies such as
Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (31). ABCC3 (MRP3) is an

8448

Cancer Res; 70(21) November 1, 2010

ABC transporter with specificity for cellular export of etoposides and antifolates, both of which are used as chemotherapeutic agents (32). AGR2 is a secretory protein, p53
inhibitor, and late-stage breast cancer marker (33, 34). As
in MCF-7+p23 cells, PMP22, ABCC3, and AGR2 have also been
shown to be upregulated in advanced cancers (32–35).
Downregulation of p8, TM4SF1, and Sox3, similar to what is
observed in MCF-7+p23 cells, is also associated with breast
cancer progression (36, 37). p8 is a nuclear phosphoprotein,
TM4SF1 is a tetraspanin family member implicated in cell
motility, and studies in Xenopus allude to Sox3 as a tumor
suppressor through its ability to bind to β-catenin and inhibit
T-cell factor signaling (38).
The gene expression changes observed in the microarray
were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. PMP22, ABCC3,
and AGR2 were upregulated 33-fold, 3.5-fold, and 1.5-fold,
respectively, in MCF-7+p23 cells compared with control
cells. p8, TM4SF1, and Sox3 were reduced by 8.6-fold, 30.8fold, and 6.1-fold, respectively (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, genes
upregulated by p23 overexpression also displayed varying
degrees of dependency on Hsp90. As expected for a gene
dependent upon Hsp90-p23 complexes, disruption of Hsp90p23 interactions in MCF-7+p23 cells with either geldanamycin
or 17-AAG, the geldanamycin analogue with lower toxicity
and used in chemotherapeutic regimens, decreased expression of ABCC3 (Supplementary Fig. S3). The same held true
for pS2 and c-myc, both well characterized ER target genes.
By contrast, expression of AGR2 was not reduced, but
rather was enhanced upon inhibition of Hsp90. This suggests that an Hsp90-sensitive pathway may repress AGR2
expression. Surprisingly, geldanamycin or 17-AAG treatments had no effect on the expression of PMP22, despite
disruption of Hsp90-p23 interaction by geldanamycin (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, the effect of p23 on PMP22 gene
expression seems Hsp90 independent. Collectively, these
data show that p23 protein levels can modulate the expression of genes misregulated in advanced breast cancers and
that certain p23-sensitive changes in gene expression are
Hsp90 independent.
We also found that 357 genes were sensitive to the ER
agonist E2 in MCF-7 cells, many of which became more or
less responsive to E2 by p23 overexpression (Fig. 1D, Supplementary Fig. S4, Supplementary Table S7). Heat maps
revealed functional similarities between these genes. For example, cluster A (Fig. 1D, yellow bar) represents genes that
changed from E2 responsive to E2 unresponsive as a result
of p23 overexpression and can be divided into two subclusters based on function. In cluster A1, 23% of genes are
involved in transcriptional regulation, including Sox11, and
in cluster A2, 61% of genes are involved in migration and cell
adhesion. Cluster B (red bar) represents genes involved in a
range of biological processes that changed from E2 unresponsive to E2 responsive. Cluster C (green bar) represents
a group of genes also involved in a variety of biological processes that are inversely regulated by p23 and E2, including
ion transport (16%) and regulation of transcription (13%).
Although they did not fall into specific clusters, other genes
characteristically involved in migration and invasion are also

sensitive to p23 overexpression, and include cell adhesion
molecule 1 (CADM1), laminin B1 (LAMB1), and metastasis
suppressor 1 (MTSS1; Fig. 1B).
Gene ontology of the genes induced by p23 revealed that
p23 overexpression particularly affects the expression of
genes involved in metabolism (Supplementary Table S3) with
the highest significance attributed to kynureninase (KYNU),
an enzyme involved in tryptophan metabolism. KYNU is also
upregulated in ER-negative breast cancer cells that have
metastasized to the lung (39), further supporting a role of
p23 in promoting tumor progression through altering gene
expression patterns.

Higher p23 protein levels result in increased histone
H3 acetylation at PMP22 and ABCC3 gene promoters
To test whether the mechanism of the p23-mediated
increase in PMP22 or ABCC3 gene expression is through
activation of transcription at corresponding promoters,
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were
performed to detect acetylation of histone H3 lysines 9
and 14 (H3-AcK9/14), marks of transcriptional activation.
The PMP22 locus encodes two transcripts that contain alternative exons 1A and 1B (Fig. 2A). Because the 1B transcript is predominantly expressed in nonneuronal cells (40),
we predicted that increases in histone acetylation at the

PMP22 locus in MCF-7+p23 cells relative to control cells
would be most likely to occur at the promoter of 1B (P2).
Histone H3-AcK9/14 levels relative to input were higher at
the PMP22 P2 in MCF-7+p23 cells than in control cells
(Fig. 2B and C, top). A similar, albeit less robust increase
in histone H3-AcK9/14 was also observed at the ABCC3
promoter (Fig. 2B and C, bottom). The ABCC3 promoter
had basal levels of histone acetylation, which could be
detected above background (nonspecific IgG) levels in
control cells (Fig. 2B). This suggests that a mechanism of
p23-mediated transcriptional activation is through increased recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes that
hyperacetylate histone H3-K9/14 and reinitiate gene transcription from active promoters.
Downregulation of PMP22 and ABCC3 gene expression
by E2 is associated with ER recruitment to distal EREs
Our microarray data revealed that many genes positively
regulated by p23 overexpression (e.g., PMP22 and ABCC3)
are negatively regulated by E2 treatment. To further explore the E2-mediated repression of genes upregulated by
p23, we treated MCF-7 control and MCF-7+p23 cells with
E2 or the selective estrogen receptor modulator TAM and
measured mRNA expression of PMP22 and ABCC3. E2
treatment repressed PMP22 and ABCC3 gene expression
roughly 2-fold in both control and MCF-7+p23 cells (Fig. 3A
and B, left). Moreover, when comparing total expression
levels of PMP22 and ABCC3 between untreated control cells
and E2-treated MCF-7+p23 cells, it is evident that E2
repression could not fully reverse the activation of these
genes elicited by p23 overexpression. Interestingly, treat-

ment with TAM increased expression of PMP22 and ABCC3
in both control and MCF-7+p23 cells (Fig. 3A and B, right).
Thus, p23 overexpression furthers induces the expression of
these genes in the presence of TAM, whereas activation
of PMP22 and ABCC3 by p23 overexpression is partially
reversed by E2.
Recent data suggest that repression by ER requires E2dependent recruitment of the receptor to the EREs of the
target gene (41). Therefore, we examined ER recruitment to
PMP22 and ABCC3 EREs predicted from ChIP-on-Chip data
(42), as well as to regions upstream of PMP22 and ABCC3 promoters (UPS) that were not predicted to bind ER (Fig. 3C).
In MCF-7+p23 cells, E2-dependent ER recruitment to
PMP22 and ABCC3 EREs is enriched relative to control cells
(Fig. 3D, compare black with dark grey bars, and Supplementary Fig. S5, compare differences between columns 14 and 6
relative to respective inputs), but not to the PMP22 or ABCC3
UPS regions (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S5). In fact, no
ER binding could be detected above nonspecific IgG levels at
PMP22 and ABCC3 UPS regions (Supplementary Fig. S5), indicating both as suitable negative control regions for ER binding. Thus, p23 overexpression increases E2-dependent ER
recruitment specifically to the EREs of the E2-repressed genes
PMP22 and ABCC3. This trend of increased ER recruitment
upon p23 overexpression to PMP22 and ABCC3 EREs is similar
to what has been observed previously at the pS2 ERE (10).
However, for pS2, ER recruitment is associated with gene
activation, rather than repression.
Interestingly, ER recruitment was evident at the PMP22
ERE and more so at the ABCC3 ERE, even in the absence
of exogenously added E2 in MCF-7+p23 cells compared with

both semiquantitative (B) and quantitative real-time PCR (C). Data are averages from three independent experiments, normalized to input, and presented

control cells (Fig. 3D, compare light grey with white bars,
and Supplementary Fig. S5, compare differences between
columns 10 and 2 relative to respective inputs). This suggests
that ER may also function as a repressor of PMP22 and
ABCC3 gene expression under basal conditions when E2
levels are very low. To assess whether ER represses “basal”
PMP22 and ABCC3 gene expression, we silenced ER expression using siRNA in both MCF-7 control and MCF-7+p23
cells and measured ABCC3 and PMP22 mRNA levels in the
absence of exogenous E2. Loss of ER resulted in a significant
induction of ABCC3 in both MCF-7 control and MCF-7+p23
cells under such basal conditions (Fig. 3E and F). Only a
modest effect was observed on PMP22 gene expression.
Therefore, ER represses PMP22 and ABCC3 gene expression
under basal and high E2 situations.

Upregulation of ABCC3 in MCF-7+p23 cells imparts
selective chemotherapeutic resistance
Because MCF-7+p23 cells express more ABCC3 mRNA
(Fig. 1B–D) compared with control cells, and ABCC3 overexpression confers multidrug resistance by exporting from cells
chemotherapeutic agents including etoposide (43) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin; ref. 44), we suspected that MCF-7+p23
cells would be more resistant than control cells to these chemotherapeutic agents. Using a sulphorhodamine B dye to
stain for surviving cells following treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, MCF-7+p23 cells survived better than control
cells in the presence of etoposide and doxorubicin (Fig. 4A
and C). This resistance was selective in that MCF-7+p23 cells

ref. 43). Resistance to etoposide and doxorubicin, but not
camptothecin, was validated using clonogenic assays (data
not shown). To assess the requirement for ABCC3 in doxorubicin resistance, because it is commonly used to treat
metastatic and recurrent breast cancers, we silenced the
expression of ABCC3 using siRNA and measured sensitivity
of MCF-7+p23 cells to doxorubicin. Our analysis revealed
that MCF-7+p23 cells are nearly 50% more sensitive to doxorubicin when ABCC3 expression is reduced by 80% (Fig. 4D),
indicating that doxorubicin resistance is mediated in part by
ABCC3. Lack of complete sensitization can be attributed to
other multidrug resistance proteins capable of exporting
doxorubicin (43).
High p23 expression correlates with shorter diseasefree survival times in breast cancer patients
Because breast cancer cells that express more p23 have a
higher invasive potential and are more drug resistant, we
suspected that patients expressing high levels of p23 protein
would have shorter periods of disease-free survival. We analyzed 213 specimens from a human breast tissue microarray
for intensity of p23 staining in the nucleus and cytoplasm

on a scale of 0 to 3, with 3 as the highest intensity staining
(Supplementary Fig. S6).
Using univariate analysis we determined associations between cytoplasmic p23, nuclear p23, stage, and tumor size
(T), nodal involvement (N), and metastasis (M; TNM status).
We found that cytoplasmic p23 is significantly associated
with nuclear p23 expression (Spearman correlation ρ =
0.37), as well as with stage (ρ = 0.23) and nodal involvement
(ρ = 0.26), but does not correlate significantly with tumor size
(ρ = 0.16) or metastasis (ρ = 0.12; Supplementary Table S4).
High cytoplasmic p23 (3+) is also associated with laterstage tumors (68% are stage III/IV) compared with moderate p23 (2+) expression (36% are stage III/IV; χ2, P < 0.01;
Table 1). Interestingly 73% of the high cytoplasmic p23–
expressing tumors displayed nodal involvement, whereas
only 41% of the moderate cytoplasmic p23–expressing cancers are node positive (χ2, P < 0.01; Table 1). This is consistent with our observation that MCF-7+p23 cells are more
migratory and invasive than control MCF-7 cells (10).
We used Cox proportional hazards models for each variable
individually to examine the association of that variable with
recurrence or death (Table 2). High levels of cytoplasmic p23,

were treated with the indicated concentrations of etoposide, camptothecin (Cpt; B); or doxorubicin (C). Percent survival upon increasing concentrations
of drugs was determined using the sulphorhodamine B dye, which coats cells evenly so optical density (OD) values are proportional to cell number. Data are
expressed as averages of at least three independent experiments with untreated cells set at 100% survival. Error bars, SE. D, MCF-7+p23 cells were

and siControls were measured by quantitative real-time PCR (right).

stage III/IV disease, and high T, N, and M were all individually
associated with increased recurrence and death. When these
variables were considered jointly (multivariable), only cytoplasmic p23 expression and stage were associated with disease
recurrence or death (from Cox models). Our findings indicate
that individuals with stage I/II disease and high cytoplasmic
p23 (3+) expression (stage I/II-p23high) are 2.35 times more
likely to have recurrent disease or death than the same stage
patient with low p23 (1+ or 2+) expression (stage I/II-p23low;
Table 2 and Fig. 5). Moreover, patients with stage III/IV disease
and cytoplasmic p23 1+ or 2+ expression (stage III/IV-p23low),
or stage III/IV disease and cytoplasmic p23 3+ expression
(stage III/IV-p23high) are 3.34 and 7.85 times more likely to
have disease recurrence than those stage I/II-p23low individuals
(Table 2 and Fig. 5). At 150 months postsurgery, the cumulative
disease-free survival for patients with stage I/II-p23low tumors
is estimated at 80%; the corresponding estimates are 50% of
individuals with stage I/II-p23high , 44% with stage III/IVp23low , and 18% with stage III/IV-p23high tumors (Fig. 5).

Although stage alone is highly associated with recurrence or
death (likelihood ratio = 45.77), the addition of cytoplasmic
p23 expression to the Cox proportional hazard models significantly improves the model fit (likelihood ratio = 52.15). In summary, individuals with high levels of cytoplasmic p23 and stage
III/IV disease are more likely to exhibit lymph node metastases
and experience disease recurrence and mortality.

Discussion
We have determined that many genes affected by p23
overexpression in MCF-7 cells are also misregulated in advanced breast cancers. These genes display varying sensitivities to treatments with Hsp90 inhibitors, TAM, or E2,
which could play a role in the responsiveness of tumor cells
to antiestrogen treatment or chemotherapy. For example,
ABCC3 is upregulated by p23 overexpression alone, is
Hsp90 dependent, is further upregulated by TAM treatment,

and is downregulated by E2 treatment. Functionally, ABCC3
confers selective resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in
MCF-7+p23 cells when compared with control cells, and we
observed preliminarily that siRNA-mediated or pharmacologic depletion of ER, using ICI 182,720 treatment, decreases the
sensitivity of MCF-7 control cells to doxorubicin (data not
shown). Thus, both gene expression data and functional
studies show that p23 via ABCC3 may regulate chemotherapeutic resistance acquired in metastatic and recurrent ERnegative breast tumors.
How might p23 selectively affect gene expression? p23 has
been suggested to play a role in the binding and clearance of
steroid receptors at response elements (8–10). Our results also
indicate that p23 increases recruitment of ER to EREs of
E2-repressed genes ABCC3 and PMP22 (Fig. 3) as well as to
ER-activated genes pS2 and cathepsin D (10). Thus, certain transcription factors, like steroid receptors, may utilize p23 to
efficiently cycle on and off DNA to modulate gene transcription.
We find that “active” histone modifications (H3-AcK9/14)
are present at the promoters of p23-sensitive genes (Fig. 2B
and C). The fact that these modifications are also present at
the promoters of some p23-sensitive genes in MCF-7 control
cells where p23 is not overexpressed (Fig. 2B) indicates that
p23 may not need to overcome the transcriptional barriers
associated with gene silencing to upregulate gene expression. Therefore, a mechanism p23 may use to increase gene

8454

expression could be to recruit histone acetyltransferases
(HATs) implicated in transcription reinitiation (i.e., GCN5),
rather than those involved in transcription initiation (i.e.,
p300; ref. 45) to raise the transcriptional output from already
active promoters.
Indeed, we observed a functional interaction between p23
and the HAT GCN5 by conducting a synthetic lethal screen in
yeast, suggesting that p23 affects the activity of HAT pathways in an overlapping fashion with GCN5.9 Histone H3K9/14 is a target for acetylation by GCN5 (39, 46, 47), which
further implicates GCN5 as a HAT-mediating hyperaceylation at the promoters of p23-upregulated genes. Interestingly,
two metabolic genes regulated by p23, ACSL1 and KYNU,
which are upregulated in metastatic and recurrent breast
cancers, are also known to regulate the activity of HATs
and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase chromatin remodeling
enzymes (39, 46, 47). Therefore, a plausible model for p23sensitive gene regulation is that p23 may influence the DNA
binding dynamics of specific transcription factors to upregulate or downregulate gene expression. p23 may also modulate the recruitment of coactivators necessary to reinitiate
transcription from active loci to increase gene expression.
Further, amplification of gene regulation in situations of

Effects of p23 on Tumor Progression in Breast Cancer

Figure 5. p23 expression and clinical outcome in human breast cancer.
Kaplan-Meier curves plotting time to recurrence (in months) versus
survival probability are shown for patients with stage I/II disease and low
p23 (red solid line), stage I/II disease and high p23 (blue dotted line),
stage III/IV disease and low p23 (green dotted line), or stage III/IV disease
and high p23 (purple dotted line). Hazard ratios were calculated using
multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and are shown for
patients classified according to stage (I/II or III/IV) and p23 expression
levels (low, 1+ or 2+; high, 3+).

p23 overexpression may occur through the enhancement of
p23-sensitive metabolic pathways that affect the activity
of chromatin-modifying enzymes. Whether or not p23 is
recruiting these factors directly is still under investigation.
p23 localizes to both the nucleus and cytoplasm in MCF-7
cells (Supplementary Fig. S7), and high cytoplasmic p23
correlates with shorter disease-free survival times for breast
cancer patients, indicating that p23 can promote tumorigenesis by functioning in multiple cellular compartments. In
fact, we observe increased activated Akt1 in the cytoplasm
and an expanded phosphoproteome in the cytoplasm and
nucleus of MCF-7+p23 compared with control cells, suggesting that p23 overexpression facilitates, either directly or indirectly, enhanced kinase activity and protein phosphorylation
(Supplementary Fig. S8). Given that activated Akt is a potent

survival signal, our findings also suggest that tumors overexpressing p23 would have a survival advantage (48). Therefore,
we propose that cancers with high levels of p23 activate
signaling pathways in the cytoplasm, which can also amplify
p23-sensitive gene transcription in the nucleus.
Our findings strongly suggest that individuals with breast
cancers that display high p23 protein levels are more likely
to exhibit lymph node involvement and experience disease
recurrence and mortality. This is consistent with our in vitro
model that p23 overexpression elicits gene expression and
phenotypic changes in MCF-7 cells akin to those that occur
as breast tumors become invasive. Given that nodal status is
the most significant factor in predicting survival (49), it will be
important to find ways to reduce p23 expression to decrease
lymph node metastases. Lowering p23 expression should
also mitigate p23-mediated chemotherapeutic resistance (etoposide, doxorubicin). Recently, celastrol, the active compound
in Thunder of God Vine root extracts used in traditional
Chinese medicine, has been shown to bind and inactivate
p23 by triggering its oligomerization into fibers (50). Thus,
targeting p23 should reduce invasiveness and drug resistance
in breast cancer cells and prevent disease recurrence.
