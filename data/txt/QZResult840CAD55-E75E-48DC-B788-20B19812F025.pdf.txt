Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The androgen receptor (AR) has a vital role in the onset and progression of prostate cancer by
promoting G1-S progression, possibly by functioning as a licensing factor for DNA replication.
We here report that low dose 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME), an endogenous estrogen metabolite,
induces mitotic arrest in prostate cancer cells involving activation of the E3 ligase CHIP (Cterminus of Hsp70-interacting protein) and degradation of the AR. Depletion of the AR by small
interfering RNA (siRNA) eliminates 2-ME-induced arrest and introducing AR into PC3-M cells
confers 2-ME-induced mitotic arrest. Knockdown of CHIP or MDM2 (mouse homolog of double
minute 2 protein) individually or in combination reduced AR degradation and abrogated M phase
arrest induced by 2-ME. Our data link AR degradation via ubiquitination to mitotic arrest.
Targeting the AR by activating E3 ligases such as CHIP represents a novel strategy for the
treatment of prostate cancer.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor, has a pivotal role in
the development and progression of prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths among the men in the United States.1 The AR acquires autonomous function
and actively promotes cancer cell growth and proliferation, in part by promoting cell cycle
progression.2 The natural history of prostate cancer is characterized by the propensity of the
disease to progress from an early stage androgen-dependent state to an androgenindependent state.3 Although most patients with metastatic disease initially respond to
androgen ablation, ultimately they develop androgen-independent metastases and succumb
to their disease.4

Despite the fact that late stage prostate cancer is refractory to androgen withdrawal or
antiandrogen therapy, signaling through the AR is thought to be crucial in disease
progression. The AR itself is therefore a therapeutic target, since AR signaling remains
important even in the face of androgen deprivation or blockade through mechanisms,
including amplification or mutation of the AR, as well as through alterations in AR
activators or coactivators.5–7 These molecular alterations allow AR signaling to remain
active in response to low levels of adrenal androgen, other steroids and even antiandrogens
as well as by ligand independent mechanisms.7 Furthermore, a correlation exists between
androgen independence and the level of AR expression.8,9 The failure of current therapeutic
strategies may be explained, at least in part, by the fact that the AR is expressed in
essentially all human prostate cancers, even those that have become hormone refractory.8,9
As androgen-AR signaling is critical for prostate cancer cell proliferation and maintenance,
decreasing AR levels in prostate cancer cells is an attractive therapeutic strategy for this
deadly malignancy.

2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME) is a naturally occurring estrogen metabolite, which interferes
with microtubule function by inhibiting polymerization, and has been shown to exhibit both
antitumor and antiangiogenic properties.10–15 2-ME causes growth inhibition and apoptosis
in both androgen-independent (PC3-M and C4-2) and androgen-dependent (LNCaP)
prostate cancer cell lines by arresting cells in M phase of the cell cycle.14,15 We have
previously demonstrated that 2-ME effectively radiosensitizes PC3-M cells in vitro and in
vivo by modulating p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase.16 As the AR is the key
regulator of prostate cancer progression, we explored the role of the AR in 2-ME-induced
cell cycle arrest.
Here, we show the AR-positive cell lines (LNCaP, C4-2 and 22RV1) are ten-fold more
sensitive to 2-ME-induced M phase arrest than AR-negative PC3-M cells. The increased
sensitivity of AR-positive cells to 2-ME treatment is due to degradation of the AR caused by
2-ME activation of the E3 ligase CHIP (C-terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein), as
knockdown of either AR or CHIP makes AR-positive cells resistant to 2-ME-induced
mitotic arrest. This finding establishes a novel link between AR degradation by CHIP and
mitotic arrest.

RESULTS
Human prostate cancer cells arrest in G2/M phase in response to low doses of 2-ME

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We treated AR-positive and AR-null prostate cancer cell lines with different concentrations
of 2-ME for 24 h. In the AR-positive cell lines LNCaP (Figure 1a), C4-2 (Figure 1b) and
22Rv1 (Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure S1A) cells were arrested in G2/M phase (by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis) at and above a dose of 0.5 μM of 2ME. In contrast, in the AR-null cell line PC3-M 2-ME had to be added up to 5 μM to elicit a
response (Figure 1d). Notably, we did not observe any significant changes in G2/M phase
population in RWPE1 (immortalized normal prostate epithelial cells) even at higher doses of
2-ME (Figure 1e and Supplementary Figure S1B). The fraction of cells in G1 and S phases
decreased, corresponding to the increase in G2/M in all the four cell lines. The cells with 4
N DNA content by FACS were arrested in mitosis, as evident from increased
phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 (Supplementary Figure S2) However, at low doses
of 2-ME (0.5 μM) proliferation of LNCaP (Supplementary Figure S3A) and C4-2
(Supplementary Figure S3B) cells were inhibited as early as day 1 and barely detectable by
day 4, in contrast to PC3-M cells that continued to proliferate even at higher 2-ME
concentrations (Supplementary Figure S3C).

Involvement of p53 in the mitotic arrest

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

PC3-M cells lack p53, which might account for the striking difference in mitotic arrest and
proliferation in response to 2-ME. p53 controls both G2/M and G1 cell cycle check points in
human fibroblasts.17 Therefore, we examined the p53 status in 2-ME treated LNCaP and
C4-2 cells. As shown in Supplementary Figure S4A and Supplementary Figure S4B, p53
levels increased in a 2-ME dose-dependent manner. To test whether p53 was involved in
mitotic arrest induced by low concentrations of 2-ME, we silenced p53 by RNA interference
(RNAi) in LNCaP and C4-2 cells, and observed no significant difference in the proportion
of G2/M cells compared with control (Supplementary Figure S4C and Supplementary Figure
S4D). The efficiency of p53 knockdown is shown in Supplementary Figure S4E, lane 2 and
lane 6 for LNCaP and C4-2, respectively. These data led us to conclude that 2-ME-induced
mitotic arrest in prostate cancer cells was not p53-dependent.
AR protein is decreased post-transcriptionally upon 2-ME treatment
AR protein levels were significantly reduced in response to 2-ME in both LNCaP (Figure
2a) and C4-2 (Figure 2b) cells. Interestingly, quantitative reverse-transcription–PCR (qRT–
PCR) revealed that AR mRNA levels were unchanged in 2-ME treated vs untreated controls
in both LNCaP (Figure 2c) and C4-2 cells (Figure 2d). Ablation of AR protein relative to
unchanged RNA suggests that post-transcriptional mechanisms were in play.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Silencing of AR abrogates mitotic arrest
Silencing of the AR using small interfering (siRNA) abrogated the G2/M arrest in response
to 2-ME in both LNCaP (Figure 2e) and C4-2 cells (Figure 2f). AR protein levels were
reduced in control siRNA cells upon 2-ME treatment (Supplementary Figures S5A and
S5B). Similar results were observed when the AR was silenced by a second siRNA that
targeted the 3′-UTR (untranslated region) of the AR gene (siAR-2), (Supplementary Figure
S5C). On the other hand, stable expression of wild-type AR in PC3-M cells conferred
sensitivity to 2-ME treatment, with more cells accumulating in G2/M, compared with
control cells (Figure 2g). These data strongly suggest the AR is required for the response to
2-ME in these cell lines.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

2-ME downregulates AR in S phase in both LNCaP and C4-2 cells To determine in which
stage of the cell cycle AR was down-regulated, LNCaP and C4-2 cells were stalled at the
G1/S transition by treatment for 24 h with aphidicholin, an inhibitor of the replicative DNA
polymerase. Cells were then treated with or without 2-ME for an additional 24 h. The cells
were arrested in G1/S phase (Figure 3a, 0 h), and AR protein was still down-regulated in
response to 2-ME treatment (Figure 3b, 0 h, compare DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) and 2-ME
treatment).
To further assess the importance of the AR in mitotic arrest by 2-ME, cells were washed and
released from aphidicholin block in the presence or absence of 2-ME. Their progression
through S phase and G2 was followed by FACS (Figure 3a). Although we did not observe
any difference in S phase entry (3 h) between 2-ME-treated and untreated cells, a significant
proportion of 2-ME-treated cells remained in G2/M phase (4 N DNA content) at later times
(6, 12 and 24 h). In contrast, vehicle (DMSO)-treated cells entered into the next cell cycle.
As expected, AR levels were downregulated in S phase by 2-ME, resulting in G2/M arrest.
Proteasomal degradation of the AR is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligases, CHIP and
MDM2 (mouse homolog of double minute 2 protein)
Our results revealed that AR protein ablation by 2-ME is post-transcriptional, so we asked
whether this occurred via proteasomal degradation. We treated LNCaP (Figure 4a) and C4-2
(Figure 4b) cells with 2-ME in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132.

Immunoblots showed that the AR was reduced within 3 h of 2-ME treatment, but this was
prevented by MG132 for all time points up to 24 h. We checked AR ubiquitination after 2ME treatment. As shown in Figures 4c and d 2-ME treatment increased the level of
ubiquitinated AR and this was increased further by MG132 compared with controls in both
LNCap and C4-2 respectively.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Proteasomal degradation of the AR is known to be mediated by two well known E3 ligases:
CHIP and MDM2. To determine the involvement of CHIP in 2-ME-induced AR
degradation, various components of the heat shock protein (Hsp)–CHIP complex were
silenced by siRNA (Figures 4e and f). The complex is composed of two Hsps, Hsp70 and
Hsp90, and CHIP itself. Knockdown of Hsp70 partially protected the AR from 2-ME
induced degradation (compare lanes 2 and 4 in both panels), but knockdown of Hsp90 failed
to do so (compare lanes 2 and 6 in both panels). Knockdown of CHIP was more effective
and significantly reduced 2-ME-induced degradation of the AR (compare lanes 2 and 8 in
both panels). Similar results were observed when the CHIP was silenced by a second siRNA
that targeted the 3′-UTR of the CHIP gene (siCHIP-2), (Supplementary Figure S6). These
observations suggested that CHIP, and its interacting partner Hsp70 are involved in 2-MEinduced AR degradation. We did not observe additional protection of the AR when we
knocked down Hsp70 or Hsp90 along with CHIP (compare lane 8 to lanes 12 and 14 in both
panels), or when all the three components of the Hsp–CHIP complex were knocked down
(compare lanes 8 and 16 in both panels).
MDM2 targets the AR when growth factors or cytokines induce its phosphorylation by
PI3K/Akt. To assess MDM2 involvement in 2-ME-induced AR degradation, MDM2 was
silenced by siRNA, which partially protected the AR in both LNCaP (Figure 4e) and C4-2
(Figure 4f) cells (compare lanes 2 and 18). The knockdown of both CHIP and MDM2
prevented AR degradation in C4-2 (Figure 4f) (compare lanes 1–2 and 21–22); however,
this combination was not as effective in LNCap cells (Figure 4e). A recent report has shown
that RNF6, another E3 ligase, polyubiquitinates the AR and regulates its transcriptional
activity. We silenced RNF6 by siRNA, but as shown in Figures 4e and f, the AR was still
degraded even when RNF6 was virtually absent (Supplementary Figure S7). Together, these
data led us to conclude that the E3 ligases CHIP and MDM2, but not RNF6, are involved in
2-ME-induced AR degradation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As the AR acts as a licensing factor, it should be degraded in the M phase of the cell cycle to
allow initiation of the next cell cycle18 To determine whether 2-ME-induced AR
degradation is a consequence of M phase cell cycle arrest (Figures 1a and b), we treated
LNCaP, C4-2 and PC3-M cells with different concentrations of colchicine. As expected,
colchicine treatment arrested cells in M phase (Supplementary Figures S8A, S8B and S8C).
However, under these conditions AR protein degradation was not observed in LNCaP
(Supplementary Figure S8D) and C4-2 (Supplementary Figure S8E) cells. These results
suggest that 2-ME-induced AR degradation is not a consequence of M phase cell cycle
arrest, but that M phase arrest is likely a consequence of AR degradation.
Protection of AR by silencing CHIP and MDM2 prevents mitotic arrest
To test the hypothesis that AR is involved in progression through mitosis, we interfered with
AR degradation by knocking down the E3 ligases, CHIP and MDM2. Depletion of CHIP
and MDM2, individually or in combination, abrogated the M phase arrest induced by 2-ME
in LNCaP (Figure 5a) and C4-2 (Figure 5b) cells. In addition, knockdown of Hsp70, which
partially protected the AR, partially abrogated M phase arrest. On the other hand,
knockdown of Hsp90 or RNF6 failed to abrogate M phase cell cycle arrest. These findings
further support the idea that 2-ME regulates the cell cycle in AR-positive prostate cancer
cells by promoting proteasome-dependent degradation of the AR.

DISCUSSION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The AR has a critical role in prostate cancer progression, in part through the transcriptional
regulation of AR responsive genes. Decreasing androgen levels either through castration or
pharmacologically by AR blockade are effective initial therapies for advanced prostate
cancer patients, although relapse is inevitable.5,19 The AR not only mediates the effect of
androgen on tumor initiation but also has a major role in the transition from androgen
dependence to androgen independence.5,6,20 The AR is also known to be a licensing factor
for AR-positive and androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells and interacts with a number of
other licensing factors including hZimp7, hZimp10 and SWI-SNF-like BRG1-associated
factors at the origin of DNA replication.18,21,22 The AR also interacts with the prereplication
complex proteins ORC2, Cdt1 and Cdc6.23 Recently, it has been shown that Cdc6 is under
the direct transcriptional control of the AR, indicating that both G1 and S phase components
of the cell cycle machinery may be regulated by AR.24,25 Thus, a strong rationale exists for
searching for new drugs to stimulate downregulation of AR levels to treat castrationresistant prostate cancer.

Previous work showed 2-ME causes a G2/M arrest, and this was understood to involve its
binding to the colchicine site on microtubules, at concentrations greater than 5 μM.26,27 We
observed that much lower concentrations of 2-ME (that is, 0.5 μM) induced mitotic arrest in
AR-positive cells (LNCaP, C4-2 and 22Rv1) but not in AR null PC3-M and RWPE1 cells.
The presence of AR sensitized prostate cancer cells to 2-ME-induced mitotic arrest, and
conversely, the absence of AR made cells more resistant to 2-ME.
How does AR sensitize cells to 2-ME induced mitotic arrest? One possibility for the role of
the AR in regulating mitosis is that the AR transcriptionally activates genes, which are
necessary for mitotic progression, and when AR is degraded, mitotic progression stalls. In
support of this hypothesis, a recent report has documented that AR upregulates M-phase cell
cycle genes in prostate cancer cells.28 Another related question is whether AR degradation is
the cause of or the consequence of mitotic arrest. Our data clearly demonstrate that AR
degradation is not the consequence of mitotic arrest, as the AR can be degraded in S phase
(Figure 3). Furthermore, colchicine treatment produced mitotic arrest but not AR
degradation (Supplementary Figure S8).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our finding that AR is degraded through the activation of CHIP is consistent with the
degradation of other nuclear receptors, which are also subject to post-transcriptional
modifications that govern numerous facets of receptor function.29 Among them,
ubiquitination has been demonstrated to signal receptor destruction, providing an absolute
mechanism of AR inactivation.30 Several previous studies have demonstrated that E6-AP is
an E3 ubiquitin ligase for AR ubiquitination.31 MDM2 is another E3 ligase whose
ubiquitination activity requires phosphorylation of AR (by AKT), as well as deacetylation
by histone deacetylase 1.29,30 The E3 U-box ligase Hsp70 N-terminus interacting protein
(CHIP) has also been reported to be involved in AR degradation.32,33
The Hsp90/Hsp70-based chaperone machinery is required for CHIP activity. Hsp90
stabilizes associated client proteins, whereas Hsp70 interacts with a chaperone-dependent E3
ligase to promote protein degradation by polyubiquitination.34 Our data are consistent with
these reports in that 2-ME-induced AR degradation requires Hsp70 and CHIP association.
Silencing of Hsp70 partially abrogated 2-ME-induced AR degradation, likely because of
incomplete knockdown of Hsp70, while silencing of Hsp90 failed to abrogate 2-ME-induced
AR degradation.

We propose that CHIP is the primary E3 ligase, responsible for degrading the AR in
response to 2-ME. We observed retarded mobility of CHIP in SDS–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis in response to 2-ME treatment of cells, and believe this is owing to posttranslational modification. This change corresponded to enhanced degradation of AR. On
the other hand, MDM2 levels were barely detectable in 2-ME treated cells (Figure 4, lane 2),
and silencing of CHIP increased MDM2 levels. Our data are consistent with a reciprocal
relationship between CHIP and MDM2 in AR degradation, which has been described
previously.35 Phosphorylation of the AR has been shown recently to regulate the preference
of MDM2 vs CHIP as the E3 ligase responsible for AR degradation.36 As CHIP is favored
with impaired AR phosphorylation, we predict that 2-ME-induced AR degradation occurs
with low AR phosphorylation and will test this hypothesis in subsequent studies. The
possibility of 2-ME activating other E3 ligases that mediate AR degradation cannot be ruled
out.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Interestingly, AR has been previously linked to G1/S progression. Litvinov et al. have
suggested that AR functions as a licensing factor for DNA replication. AR normally is
degraded in M phase, and loss of AR is required for licensing of DNA replication, hence
knockdown of AR produces a G1 arrest, as knockdown prevents prereplication complex
formation, which is required for licensing a new round of DNA replication. This is in
keeping with both our AR as well as our CHIP knockdown data as CHIP knockdown
stabiles AR, and therefore prevents its degradation at M phase possibly explain the G1
arrest. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that beside AR, CHIP and/or MDM2
might stabilize other cell cycle genes regulating cell cycle progression.
In summary, we show that 2-ME-induced degradation of the AR, and mitotic arrest are
mediated by the Hsp70/CHIP complex. Our data reveal a previously unknown role for the
AR in the regulation of mitotic progression. Stimulation of AR degradation through E3
ligase activation (in response to 2-ME or eventually other drugs) opens up the possibility of
activating E3 ligases to decrease AR levels as a novel strategy for treating prostate cancer.

2-ME down-regulates AR in G1/S phase of cell cycle. (a) LNCaP (left) or C4-2 (right) cells
were held in G1/S by adding aphidicholin, and 24 h later cells were treated without (solid
lines) or with (dotted lines) 2-ME (2 μM). After 24 h of 2-ME treatment, cells were released
from the aphidicholin block without (solid lines) or with (dotted lines) 2-ME. Overlay of
FACS analysis for DNA content at indicated time points after release from aphidicholin is
shown. (b) Western blot analysis for AR shows AR protein is down-regulated in both
LNCaP (upper panel) and C4-2 (lower panel) cells upon 2-ME treatment. GAPDH is shown
as a loading control.

AR degradation by ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. (a) LNCaP or (b) C4-2 cells were
treated with or without 2-ME (2 μM), and with or without proteasome inhibitor MG132 (5
μg/ml). Proteasome inhibitor MG132 was added 3 h before harvest at indicated time points.
Cells were lysed and extracts were immunobloted for AR and GAPDH (as loading control).
(c,d) Ubiquitinated proteins were isolated from extracts either with control beads (lane 1) or
polyubiquitin-binding TUBEs (lane 2–5, see Materials and methods) and immunobloted for
AR in LNCaP and C4-2 cells respectively. (e) LNCaP or (f) C4-2 cells were depleted of the
indicated proteins with specific siRNA and treated with 2-ME (1 μM) for 24 h. Immunoblots
for AR, Hsp70, Hsp90, CHIP and MDM2 are shown. Tubulin blots shown as loading
controls. *Due to lack of availability of an effective antibody against RNF6, knockdown was
monitored by qRT–PCR. mRNA levels are shown in Supplementary Figure S7.
