Abstract
The Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling
pathway is important for both cell growth and survival. In
particular, an impaired regulation of the Akt/mTOR axis has
been strongly implicated in mechanisms related to neoplastic
transformation, through enhancement of cell proliferation
and survival. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of
heterogeneous hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and by a high risk of
evolution into acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The
pathogenesis of the MDS evolution into AML is still unclear,
although some recent studies indicate that aberrant activation
of survival signaling pathways could be involved. In this
investigation, done by means of immunofluorescent staining,
we report an activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway in high-risk
MDS patients. Interestingly, not only mTOR was activated but
also its downstream targets, 4E-binding protein 1 and p70
ribosomal S6 kinase. Treatment with the selective mTOR
inhibitor, rapamycin, significantly increased apoptotic cell
death of CD33+ (but not CD33 ) cells from high-risk MDS
patients. Rapamycin was ineffective in cells from healthy
donors or low-risk MDS. Moreover, incubation of high-risk
MDS patient CD34+ cells with rapamycin decreased the in vitro
clonogenic capability of these cells. In contrast, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, did not significantly
affect the clonogenic activity of high-risk MDS cells. Taken
together, our results indicate that the Akt/mTOR pathway is
critical for cell survival and proliferation in high-risk MDS
patients. Therefore, this signaling network could become an
interesting therapeutic target for treating more advanced
MDS cases. [Cancer Res 2007;67(9):4287–94]

Introduction
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is
involved in many different cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1, 2). Akt (also known as
protein kinase B) is a 57-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase that
is activated through a double phosphorylation mechanism. First,

Akt is recruited to the plasma membrane by phosphatidylinositol
(3,4,5)-triphosphate, which is synthesized by PI3K, and is then
phosphorylated by the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase
1 at the Thr308 of the activation loop. Subsequently, a still
unidentified kinase phosphorylates Akt at the Ser473 in the
COOH-terminal regulatory region domain.
An impaired regulation of the PI3K/Akt axis has been strongly
implicated in carcinogenesis (3–7). In particular, the activation of
the PI3K/Akt survival pathway is often associated with hematologic
malignancies (8–14), including acute and chronic human leukemias.
One of the downstream targets of Akt is represented by the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a highly conserved
serine/threonine protein kinase that is essential for the regulation
of cell growth and proliferation, by controlling these processes at
the translational level (15) and by acting on the cell cycle
progression. Indeed, mTOR is capable of regulating the synthesis
of key proteins, such as retinoblastoma protein, p27Kip1, cyclin D1,
c-myc, or signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.
Furthermore, recent studies have shown that mTOR is also
involved in cell death, so that a deregulation of this kinase could
lead to the activation of antiapoptotic mechanisms (16, 17).
Akt-mediated regulation of mTOR activity is a complex
multistep phenomenon (9). Akt inhibits tuberous sclerosis 2
(TSC2; or hamartin) function through direct phosphorylation.
TSC2 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that functions in
association with the putative tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1; or
tuberin) to inactivate the small G-protein Ras homologue enriched
in brain (Rheb). TSC2 phosphorylation by Akt represses GAP
activity of the TSC1/TSC2 complex, allowing Rheb to accumulate
in a GTP-bound state. Rheb-GTP then activates, through a
mechanism not yet elucidated, the protein kinase activity of
mTOR when complexed with the regulatory-associated protein of
mTOR (Raptor) adaptor protein and mLST8 (also known as GhL), a
protein homologous to h subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins.
The mTOR/Raptor/mLST8 (also referred to as mTORC1) complex
is sensitive to rapamycin and, importantly, in some cases inhibits
Akt via a negative feedback loop, which involves, at least in part,
p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K). The relationship between Akt
and mTOR is further complicated by the existence of the mTOR/
rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR/mLST8 complex (also
referred to as mTORC2), which displays rapamycin-insensitive
activity (9). Moreover, Akt directly phosphorylates mTOR on Ser2448
and activates it.
Downstream of the mTOR are two well-characterized substrates:
4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and the p70S6K. On the one hand,

the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 by mTOR suppresses its ability to
bind the translation-initiation factor eukaryotic initiation factor
4E, a protein that is recruited to the translation initiation complex
for regulating protein synthesis and initiating the translation of
transcripts encoding genes involved in cell cycle control. On the
other hand, mTOR also mediates the phosphorylation and the
subsequent activation of p70S6K, which phosphorylates the 40S
ribosomal protein S6 to initiate the translation of a 5¶-terminal
olygopyrimidine tract-containing mRNAs encoding components of
the protein synthesis machinery.
The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous
group of bone marrow disorders characterized by a defect in the
differentiation of the hematopoietic stem cell that causes anemia,
neutropenia, bleeding problems, and infections. The disease can

result in a slow decrease in blood cell counts, but it may also have a
more aggressive evolution, which is a worsening severe cytopenia
or, in f30% of all the patients, transformation into acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML). On evolution of MDS into AML,
the progressing clonal cells present an excessive survival and
decreased apoptosis (18–21). Thus, the identification of the
aberrant signaling pathways responsible for an increased survival
of MDS cells is of high importance, as they might represent
promising targets for novel forms of therapy aimed at preventing
MDS evolution into AML.
Recently, we have shown that patients affected by high-risk MDS
frequently show an activation of Akt compared with both low-risk
MDS patients and healthy donors (22). However, in that study,
we restricted our investigation to Akt. To better assess the
relevance of Akt activation for MDS progression, we decided to
investigate some of the downstream Akt targets, including mTOR,
p70S6K, and 4E-BP1. Here, we show that mTOR, p70S6K, and
4E-BP1 were phosphorylated in high-risk (but not in low-risk)
MDS patients, and this correlated with Akt activation. No
activating mutations were detected in the PI3K p110a catalytic
subunit gene of MDS patients. Furthermore, we show that
rapamycin (a mTOR pharmacologic inhibitor) decreased the
survival of CD33+ cells from high-risk MDS patients and negatively
affected the clonogenic ability of high-risk MDS CD34+ precursors.
Taken together, our findings indicate a critical role for activated
mTOR and its downstream targets as survival factors in patients
diagnosed with high-risk MDS. Hence, the Akt/mTOR pathway
could become an important target for innovative therapeutic
strategies in the treatment of high-risk MDS.

Patient characteristics and isolation of mononuclear cells from
bone marrow samples. Bone marrow samples were obtained from 20
patients with MDS and from healthy donors who had given informed
consent in accordance with institutional guidelines. All the samples were
from the Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ‘‘L. e A. Seràgnoli’’
of the Policlinico S. Orsola-Malpighi (Bologna, Italy). In all the subjects
participating in this study, the diagnosis was defined according to the
French American British classification (23), whereas the International
Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS; ref. 24) was used to divide the patients
into two categories (low- and high-risk MDS). For in vitro experiments, bone
marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) were isolated by Ficoll-Paque
(Amersham Biosciences) density gradient centrifugation.
Tissue cell cultures. Human T-lymphoblastoid CEM cells and HL60
AML cells were cultured at 37jC with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 (Cambrex
BioScience) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and streptomycin/penicillin at an optimal cell density of 0.3  106
to 0.8  106 cells/mL.

DNA extraction and mutation analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated
from total BMMCs by using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen Ltd.)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then, the DNA samples were
sequenced, as described previously (25), to investigate the presence of
mutations in the exons 9 and 20 of the PI3K p110a subunit gene.
Western blot. Equal number of cells (4  106) from CEM and HL60 cells
were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in M-PER Extraction
reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The protein
content was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) and
equal protein amounts (75 Ag) were separated by SDS-PAGE as described
elsewhere (22).
Immunocytochemistry analysis. Freshly isolated BMMCs were collected by centrifugation at a density of 0.3  106 cells/mL and immunostaining
analysis was done as described previously (22). Slides were incubated with
a mixture containing 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) as a counterstaining for nuclei and antifade as a mounting solution (DAPI/antifade,
Resnova). Finally, slides were examined under epifluorescent illumination. Images were taken on a Zeiss Axio Imager.Z1 microscope, with
60/NA 1.40 optics, coupled to a computer-driven Zeiss AxioCAM digital
camera (MRm), using the Zeiss AxioVision (version 4.5) software and
the Zeiss colocalization module with constant settings of exposure. For
quantification of immunoreactivity, at least 50 to 100 cells per slide were
counted.
CD33+ and CD34+ cell immunomagnetic positive selection. CD33+ or
CD34+ cells were obtained from total BMMCs after immunomagnetic
separation using either the CD33 mini-MACS selection kit or the CD34
Micro Beads kit (both from Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Flow cytometric analysis of apoptotic cell death. For sub-G1
(apoptotic cells) peak analysis, CD33+ and CD33 cells were cultured in
EGM-2 BulletKit medium (Cambrex BioScience) for 48 h with rapamycin
(Sigma-Aldrich) or for 24 h with LY294002 (Sigma-Aldrich). Then, the cells
were harvested by centrifugation and prepared as described previously (22).
The subdiploid DNA content was evaluated using an Epics XL flow
cytometer with the appropriate software (System II, Beckman Coulter). At
least 10,000 events per sample were acquired. Results were statistically
analyzed by GraphPad Prism software (version 3.0).
Clonogenic assays. Fresh CD34+ MDS cells were resuspended in Iscove’s
modified Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 2% FBS at a concentration
of 8  103 cells/mL and added to the methylcellulose complete medium
(MethoCult GF+ H4535, Stem Cell Technologies). Cells were then plated in
35-mm Petri dishes in the presence of rapamycin or LY294002 and
incubated in a humidified CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 37jC) for 14 days.
Colonies (>50 cells) and clusters (<50 cells) were then evaluated according
to Nissen-Druwey’s methods (26), scored under an inverted microscope, and
statistically analyzed by GraphPad Prism software (version 3.0).

Results
Patient characteristics. BMMC fractions from 20 patients
diagnosed with MDS were examined in this study. Patient demographics and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
Median age was 70.1 years (range, 53–79 years). MDS patients
were classified according to the IPSS (24), with four subgroups
showing different clinical outcomes: low risk, intermediate-1 risk,
intermediate-2 risk, and high risk. In our study, low risk and
intermediate-1 risk were grouped as low-risk MDS (n = 5),
whereas intermediate-2 risk and high risk were grouped as high-risk
MDS (n = 15). Karyotype alterations were present in f30% of the
patients. Five of the high-risk MDS patients evolved into AML.
Specificity of the antibodies. Because in most MDS cases
the number of cells available for analytic purposes represents a
limiting factor, we decided to evaluate the activation of the Akt/
mTOR pathway in BMMCs by immunocytochemistry. Therefore,
a very critical issue concerned the specificity of the antibodies
used in our study. For this reason, a series of control experiments

*Patients that evolved from MDS to AML. Quantification of immunofluorescence staining intensity: CEM cells (set as 5) were considered as a positive
control, whereas HL60 cells were considered as a negative control (set as 0).

were first done to validate the antibodies used in this investigation,
using immunofluorescent staining and Western blot. To this end,
we used the human T-lymphoblastoid CEM cell line, having high
levels of p-Akt (27), and the HL60 cell line, having none or very low
levels of p-Akt (28). About the expression of Akt, CEM cells
displayed high levels of Ser473 p-Akt, whereas HL60 cells showed
very low immunoreactivity toward Ser473 p-Akt antibody, as
expected (Fig. 1A). Control experiments were always done
excluding the primary antibody, to verify that the secondary
antibody did not result in unspecific immunostaining (data not
shown).
Given that a cross-talk between the Akt and Erk1/2 pathway
has been shown (29), we also analyzed the activation of Erk1/2
in our cell lines using both immunofluorescence staining and
Western blot. Indeed, Akt phosphorylates and down-regulates Raf,
which is an upstream activator of the mitogen-activated protein
kinase/ERK kinase/Erk1/2 pathway. Accordingly, CEM cells were
negative for Thr202/Tyr204 p-Erk1/2, whereas HL60 cells showed
higher immunoreactivity toward Thr202/Tyr204 p-Erk1/2 antibody
(Fig. 1B).
Control experiments were also done with the other phosphospecific antibodies to Ser2448 p-mTOR, Ser65 p-4E-BP1, and Thr389
p-p70S6K. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis showed that
CEM cells had high levels of these antigens, whereas HL60 had very
low levels (Fig. 1C). To further validate the results obtained with
immunocytochemical staining, we also did Western blot analysis. As
shown in Fig. 1B and C, this technique revealed that CEM cells had
an overall activation of the signaling pathway, whereas HL60
displayed absent Akt phosphorylation and extremely low levels of
Ser2448 p-mTOR, Ser65 p-4E-BP1, and Thr389 p-p70S6K. All cells
analyzed (CEM and HL60) always expressed total Akt, mTOR,

Taken together, these results showed the specificity of the antibody
used for immunocytochemistry.
Ser473 p-Akt levels and Thr202/Tyr204 p-Erk1/2 in normal and
MDS mononuclear cells. The level of Akt and Erk1/2 activation
was investigated in BMMCs from healthy donors and MDS
patients. As Fig. 2A shows, normal BMMCs and low-risk MDS
displayed barely detectable levels of Ser473 p-Akt, whereas high-risk
MDS showed an activation of Akt. The proportion of p-Akt–
positive cells varied for different high-risk MDS cases, with an
average of 50% to 70% positive cells per sample. As for Thr202/
Tyr204 Erk1/2, normal BMMCs and low-risk MDS displayed
activation of Erk1/2, whereas high-risk MDS showed much lower
levels of p-Erk1/2 (Fig. 2B). Results from all patients analyzed by
immunocytochemistry (n = 20) are summarized in Table 2. Overall,
these results confirmed our own previous findings (22).
mTOR and its downstream targets are activated in high-risk
MDS BMMCs. The levels of Ser2448 p-mTOR, Thr389 p-p70S6K, and
Ser65 p-4E-BP1 were then analyzed by immunocytochemistry in
healthy donor BMMCs and compared with those of BMMCs from
high- and low-risk MDS patients. High-risk MDS patients always
showed enhanced levels of these phosphorylated proteins compared with either low-risk MDS cells or healthy donors (Fig. 2C).
Results from all patients (n = 20) analyzed by immunocytochemistry for these antigens are summarized in Table 2. In agreement
with the p-mTOR capability of targeting both p-p70S6K and p-4EBP1, high-risk MDS patients who showed high levels of p-mTOR
(p-mTOR z 3) also displayed enhanced levels of both p-p70S6K
and p-4E-BP1. On the contrary, patients with low levels of p-mTOR
(0 V p-mTOR V 2) showed reduced levels of both p-p70S6K and
p-4E-BP1.

Akt/mTOR Activation in High-Risk MDS Patients

Lineage identity of p-Akt– and p-mTOR–positive cells in
high-risk MDS patients. Lineage identity of cells presenting a
positive staining toward p-Akt and p-mTOR was established by
double immunolabeling total BMMCs with a myeloid-specific
marker, CD33 (30). Furthermore, to evaluate the lineage specificity
of the cells, we tested another marker, CD71, which is specific for
the erythroid lineage (31). As shown in Fig. 3, BMMCs from highrisk MDS patients, which were positive for CD33, displayed a high
immunoreactivity also toward Ser473 p-Akt and Ser2448 p-mTOR. On
the contrary, cells that were positive for CD71 showed low levels of
p-Akt and p-mTOR.
Rapamycin increases apoptotic cell death in CD33+ cells
from high-risk MDS patients. CD33+ and CD33 fractions were
purified from total BMMCs and treated for 48 h with rapamycin, to
inhibit the activation of the mTOR pathway, or for 24 h with
LY294002, which selectively inhibits PI3K. Then, apoptosis was
quantified by flow cytometric analysis. Under basal conditions, the
percentage of apoptotic cells in control samples was higher in
healthy donors and low-risk MDS compared with high-risk MDS
patients, as expected. However, on treatment with rapamycin,
healthy donors and low-risk MDS patients showed little variations
in the percentage of apoptotic cells, in either the CD33+ or CD33
fraction. On the contrary, high-risk MDS cells were much more
sensitive to rapamycin, displaying a significant increase in
apoptotic cells in the CD33+ fraction, whereas CD33 cells were
much less responsive to the treatment (Fig. 4A). Because a recent
study (32) evidenced that rapamycin could result in additional Akt
activation through a feedback mechanism, we also analyzed the
levels of p-Akt in BMMCs from high-risk MDS patients after
treatment with rapamycin. However, under our experimental
conditions, the inhibition of mTOR did not result in further Akt
activation (Fig. 4B). In high-risk MDS cases, LY294002 did not
significantly change the number of apoptotic cells, whereas it
induced apoptosis in CEM cells when used at the same
concentrations (Fig. 4C). Considering that LY294002 did not
significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic CD33+ cells,
we investigated whether the p110a catalytic subunit gene of PI3K

displayed activating mutations in MDS patients. Indeed, activating
mutations of this gene have been discovered in a wide variety of
cancers (33, 34). However, we did not find any genomic mutations
in all the MDS patients analyzed (Table 2).
Clonogenic assays. The effect of rapamycin or LY294002 on
the clonogenic capability of CD34+ cells from high-risk MDS
patients was investigated next. MDS cells were plated in
methylcellulose medium with increasing concentrations of
rapamycin or LY294002 and colonies were scored after 14 days
of culture. In accordance with Nissen-Druey’s observations (26),
high-risk MDS cells originated only few small colonies, characterized by macrophage aggregates and small eosinophilic
colonies. In contrast, CD34+ cells from healthy donors showed a
normal differentiation, in that every type of lineage (erythroid,
lymphoid, and myeloid) could be visible after 14 days of culture.
Overall, rapamycin did not influence the clonogenic capability of
CD34+ cells from healthy donors nor from low-risk MDS patients
(Fig. 5A and B). In fact, the number of colonies in healthy donors
was not affected by the drug, whereas low-risk MDS displayed a
slight but nonsignificant decrease in the percentage of colony
growth after treatment with rapamycin compared with healthy
donors. In contrast, the size and number of colonies from highrisk MDS patients were significantly inhibited by rapamycin, in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). About the effects of LY294002,
the drug did not significantly reduced the growth of colonies in
high-risk MDS patients (Fig. 5D).

Discussion
Several lines of evidence indicate that the PI3K/Akt signaling
pathway plays an important role in both cell proliferation and
apoptosis, and its activation has frequently been linked with tumor
progression. In particular, this signal transduction network could be
involved in leukemogenesis (8–10), as several reports showed that
the PI3K/Akt activation protects AML blasts from undergoing
apoptosis (11–13). Furthermore, recent studies have evidenced that
the evaluation of either Akt phosphorylation status (35) or PI3K

apoptotic cells in CD33+ and CD33 fractions of healthy donors and low-risk MDS and high-risk MDS, after treatment for 48 h with increasing concentrations of
rapamycin (RAP ; 0, 10, and 20 nmol/L). No significant difference was seen in the percentage of apoptotic cells in healthy donors or low-risk MDS after treatment
with rapamycin. As for high-risk MDS, the percentage of apoptotic CD33+ cells was significantly increased after rapamycin treatment, whereas the CD33 fraction was
not significantly affected. Histograms are representative of three independent experiments. Columns, % apoptotic cells; bars, SD. *, P < 0.05 versus control cells

p110y expression (36), and the analysis of PI3K p110a catalytic
subunit gene somatic mutations (33, 34) in AML blasts may function
as prognostic markers for studying the disease progression.
The MDS are a group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders
characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and by a high risk of
evolution into AML (37). Our recent studies have suggested that
lipid-dependent signal transduction pathways could play an
essential role in the progression of MDS (22, 38–40), particularly
the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which was shown in highrisk MDS patients (22).
In this study, we investigated the functional status of some
downstream targets of Akt (i.e., mTOR, 4E-BP1, and p70S6K). By
immunocytochemical analysis, we examined the phosphorylation
levels of these proteins in MDS BMMCs, using healthy donors as
controls for comparison of staining intensity. We found that not
only mTOR was activated but also its downstream targets, 4E-BP1
and p70S6K, which are involved in both cell proliferation and
cancer progression. Either high- or low-risk MDS patients showed
detectable levels of p-mTOR, p-4E-BP1, and p-p70S6K, but the
staining intensity was different. Indeed, high-risk MDS patients
displayed high levels of p-mTOR and its downstream targets, p-4EBP1 and p-p70S6K. On the other hand, low-risk MDS patients

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (9). May 1, 2007

were only weakly positive for p-mTOR and its targets, as well as
for p-Akt, whereas healthy donors were always negative.
To assess the relevance of the Akt/mTOR pathway activation for
the survival and proliferation of MDS cells, we used rapamycin, a
macrolide that inhibits the mTOR-dependent downstream signaling pathways and is currently used alone or in combination with
cyclosporine as an immunosuppressive drug (41–43). Interestingly,
over the last few years, rapamycin has also undergone clinical trials
(44, 45) for the treatment of AML and other malignant hematologic
disorders. Rapamycin does not directly inhibit mTOR but rather
binds to its immunophilin, FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12).
Then, rapamycin/FKBP12 complex binds to mTOR complexed with
Raptor and inhibits downstream signaling events.
We isolated CD33+ and CD33 cells from healthy donors or MDS
cells so that the two fractions could be treated with increasing
concentrations of rapamycin. Interestingly, the basal levels of
apoptosis in CD33+ cells from healthy donors and low-risk MDS
was higher than in the same fraction from high-risk MDS patients
and did not change in response to rapamycin treatment. On the
contrary, untreated CD33+ cells from high-risk MDS patients
showed a lower percentage of apoptotic cells, strongly suggesting
that in these patients antiapoptotic mechanisms were activated,

Akt/mTOR Activation in High-Risk MDS Patients

and the treatment with rapamycin inhibited at least some of
these prosurvival signals, leading to a significant increase in
apoptosis. The findings indicating a selective toxicity of rapamycin
on CD33+ cells are fully consistent with the fact that the mTOR
activation was detected in CD33+ cells but not in CD71+ cells from
high-risk MDS patients. This observation seems to indicate that the
activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway is selective for the myeloid
lineage and could also explain why MDS evolution into erythroleukemia is an exceptional event (31).
Furthermore, we did methylcellulose-based clonogenic assays
with CD34+ MDS cells. Our results show that in CD34+ cells from
high-risk MDS, rapamycin significantly inhibited the growth of
colonies in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the treatment did
not influence the clonogenic ability of CD34+ cells from neither
healthy donors nor low-risk MDS.
Another important finding of our study is that rapamycin
treatment did not result in further activation of Akt as could be
expected because it was initially thought that rapamycin would
inhibit mTORC1 but not TORC2, and this could result in additional Akt up-regulation (46). Nevertheless, recent results have
highlighted that prolonged treatment with rapamycin could also
inhibit mTORC2 and, as a consequence, down-regulate Akt
phosphorylation (47).
Interestingly, we showed that in high-risk MDS samples, Erk1/2
was not activated, whereas healthy donors and low-risk MDS
showed a higher amount of active Erk1/2. This finding underscores
a difference between MDS and AML, where both Erk1/2 and Akt
are usually strongly activated in the same patients (29). Given that

LY294002 was not effective in inducing apoptosis or reducing
clonogenic capability, it is conceivable that in high-risk MDS, the
activation of Akt is PI3K independent. This hypothesis was also
strengthened by the absence of activating genomic mutations in
the PI3K p110a subunit gene, which have not been found in our
MDS patients. Moreover, our preliminary results showed that a
selective inhibitor for PI3Ky (48), which was highly effective in AML
patients to inhibit cell proliferation, had no effect in our high-risk
MDS samples. This is another difference between MDS and most
AML cases, as far as activation of PI3K/Akt is concerned, although
PI3K-independent Akt up-regulation has been reported in a few
AML cases (9).
It might be that Akt activation in MDS samples is related to
protein kinase C-h, which has been shown to represent a potential
alternative pathway for Akt up-regulation in both chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (49) and multiple myeloma (50). Alternatively, Akt up-regulation in MDS might be due to decreased activity
of protein phosphatases acting on phosphorylated Akt forms (9).
Taken together, our results show that in high-risk MDS patients,
the Akt/mTOR pathway is overactivated and that this leads to an
imbalance in the apoptotic processes. Therefore, this survival
network is likely to play an important role in the MDS pathogenesis
and contribute to the malignant growth of MDS cells. Furthermore,
our findings indicate that the mTOR pathway is specifically upregulated in the hematopoietic myeloid progenitors of high-risk
MDS patients. In fact, rapamycin, but not LY294002, influenced the
clonogenic ability of CD34+ MDS cells by reducing the size and
number of the colonies. It is interesting that in a very recent pilot

Figure 5. Rapamycin, but not LY294002, negatively affects the clonogenic capability of CD34+ cells from high-risk MDS patients. High- and low-risk MDS and healthy
donor CD34+ cells were incubated in the appropriate medium in the presence of increasing concentrations of rapamycin or LY294002. The colonies (>50 cells)
were scored at day 14. A, healthy donors: rapamycin did not influence the colony growth. B, low-risk MDS patients: rapamycin slightly reduced the number and size
of the colonies, but the differences were not statistically significant. C, high-risk MDS: rapamycin significantly inhibited both the number and the size of the colonies.
D, high-risk MDS: LY294002 reduced slightly, but not significantly, the number and the size of the colonies. Results are percentage of control. Columns, mean of
duplicates from three independent experiments; bars, SD. **, P < 0.01 versus control cells (Dunnett test after ANOVA).

study, sirolimus (rapamycin) was used with some success in
advanced MDS patients (44). However, in that investigation, no
functional evaluation of the Akt/mTOR axis was done. Therefore,
we feel that our data are complementary to those findings and
strengthen the concept that the Akt/mTOR axis could become in
the future an important target for the development of innovative
strategies for the MDS treatment.
