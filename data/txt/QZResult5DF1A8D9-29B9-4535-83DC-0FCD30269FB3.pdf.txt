ABSTRACT
Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most malignant brain tumors in humans and have
a very poor prognosis. New therapeutic options are urgently needed. A novel drug,
Vacquinol-1 (Vac), a quinolone derivative, displays promising properties by inducing
rapid cell death in GBM but not in non-transformed tissues. Features of this type of cell
death are compatible with a process termed methuosis. Here we tested Vac on a highly
malignant glioma cell line observed by long-term video microscopy. Human dental-pulp
stem cells (DPSCs) served as controls. A major finding was that an exogenous ATP
concentration of as little as 1 μM counter regulated the Vac-induced cell death. Studies
using carvacrol, an inhibitor of transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily
M, member 7 (TRPM7), demonstrated that the ATP-inducible inhibitory effect is likely
to be via TRPM7. Exogenous ATP is of relevance in GBM with large necrotic areas. Our
results support the use of GBM cultures with different grades of malignancy to address
their sensitivity to methuosis. The video-microscopy approach presented here allows
decoding of signaling pathways as well as mechanisms of chemotherapeutic resistance
by long-term observation. Before implementing Vac as a novel therapeutic drug in
GBM, cells from each individual patient need to be assessed for their ATP sensitivity.
In summary, the current investigation supports the concept of methuosis, described as
non-apoptotic cell death and a promising approach for GBM treatment. Tissue-resident
ATP/necrosis may interfere with this cell-death pathway but can be overcome by a
natural compound, carvacrol that even penetrates the blood-brain barrier.

required. Established apoptosis-directed therapy has not
resulted in an improved prognosis [2]. Importantly, GBM
disseminate within the brain and lack hematogenous
spreading [3–5]. Nevertheless, major changes of the
patients’ immune system are consistently found [6],
implying an as yet not fully understood crosstalk between
the tumor environment and hematological/immunological
elements. Alterations of the immune system are relevant
to survival [6, 7].

INTRODUCTION
Approximately 30% of all primary brain tumors
are diagnosed as Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a
highly fatal malignancy with high mutagenicity and
extreme migration and invasion potentials, explaining
the poor survival rate [1]. In addition to standard
radiochemotherapy inducing apoptosis-related cell death,
new effective therapeutic modalities for GBM are urgently

Only recently, screening of a small molecule
library (NCI-DTP Diversity Set II) revealed a quinolone
substance termed Vacquinol-1 (Vac), which induces
a novel form of a cell death that appears to be highly
restricted to GBM [8]. Characteristics of Vac-induced
glioma cell death include cell blebbing followed by
rupture of the plasma membrane. In situ, GBMs contain
large areas of necrotic tissue [9, 10], which are likely
to be ATP-rich [11]. Extracellular ATP is an important
signaling molecule that acts via purinergic receptors
and ion channels [12, 13]. Moreover, extracellular ATP
possesses a growth-promoting effect on glioma cells [14],
and may act through metabotropic P2Y and ionotropic
P2X receptors [12]. Therefore, we considered whether
ATP might influence Vac-inducible cell death. In addition
to purinergic receptors, ATP can lead to activation of
the ubiquitously expressed transient receptor potential
cation channel, subfamily M, member 7 (TRPM7) cation
channel [15]. TRPM7 plays a role in several cancer types,
including breast cancer [16], gastric cancer [17] and
pancreatic cancer [18]. The high physiological relevance
of TRPM7 for GBM was recently demonstrated by the
remarkable growth-inhibitory effect when TRPM7 was
blocked [19]. Chen and colleagues demonstrated that the
tumoricidal activity of the natural terpenoid carvacrol
was through TRPM7 inhibition [19]. In this study, we
addressed Vac-inducible cell death in an extremely
aggressive glioblastoma cell line (#12537-GB) and its
sensitivity to ATP using long-term observation by live
cell imaging (IncuCyteZOOM®, Essenbio.com, USA).
Results provide evidence for i) Vac-induced cell death
in GBM-derived cell lines, but not in dental-pulp stem
cells (DPSCs), and ii) the potential of ATP-induced
counter regulation. The ATP-related effects appear to be
mediated by TRPM7 and are sensitive to carvacrol. One
important rationale to address ATP induced effects arises
from its properties to function as a danger signal in solid
tumors [20].

for 43 h). With high Vac concentrations (14 μM, 28 μM),
glioma cells died in <2 h (Supplementary Figure 1). For
further experiments, we chose a Vac concentration of 7
μM for all kinetic analyses. Figure 1 shows the results
of continuous imaging of both phase contrast and red
fluorescence over a period of 16 h (#12537-GB), 45 h
(U-87), or 48 h (DPSCs), with frames taken at 15–120min intervals. Red fluorescence corresponding to dead
cells ranged between 2–5% of the total population in
U-87 and #12537-GB control cell layers (Figure 1A,
1B). When trying to interfere with Vac-induced cell
death, we identified that exogenous ATP exhibited the
most pronounced counter regulatory effect (Figure 1A,
1B). Within 1.25 h of observation, Vac treatment of the
#12537-GB cell line already differed significantly in
viability from untreated controls (two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA), p<0.0001), Figure 1A). In contrast,
viability impaired by Vac treatment of U-87 only differed
at 8 h from untreated controls (Figure 1B). The time
point of greatest differences between Vac and Vac+ATP
treatments is illustrated in the right columns of Figure 1.
After 4 h of incubation, the differences in PI fluorescence
corresponding to cell death were significant in #12537GB (multiple comparison two-way ANOVA, p<0.0001:
control/Vac; p<0.0001: Vac/Vac+ATP). However, in
U-87, the time point of greatest difference was observed
later, at 25 h of incubation (multiple comparison twoway ANOVA, p<0.0001: control/Vac; p=0.0012: Vac/
Vac+ATP). The results were compared with DPSCs, a
stem cell line from third molars (Figure 1C). Vac-treated
DPSCs did not display any significant PI uptake during
the observational period (Figure 1C). The right column of
Figure 1C illustrates PI uptake after 4 h of incubation in
DPSCs, which was not significant after treatment. Taken
together, Vac-induced cell death is sensitive to the counter
regulatory effect by ATP, following cell-specific kinetics:
Vac induced almost 100% cell death in #12537-GB within
16 h of incubation whereas U-87 cells responded in a
delayed fashion, with cell death still on-going after 45 h
of incubation.

RESULTS

in glioma cell lines

Vac induces rapid cell death in glioma cell lines
and is sensitive to exogenous ATP
In the present study, we investigated the kinetics
of Vac on the viability of the established glioma cell
line U-87 and the new, highly aggressive glioma cell
line designated #12537-GB, and thus confirmed and
extended endpoint observations reported by Kitambi
and colleagues [8]. To determine cell viability of preestablished cell layers, we applied the live cell imaging
system IncuCyteZOOM® equipped with a 10× objective
and used propidium iodide (PI) staining to determine cell
death. Vac concentrations of 0.07 μM and 0.7 μM were
applied to #12537-GB, but there was no significant effect
on cell viability (IncuCyteZOOM®, kinetics of cell death

We then investigated whether Vac-induced cell
death was related to apoptosis. Therefore, caspase 3/7
was quantified using enzyme-activity assays (Essenbio.
com), generating a green fluorescent signal detectable by
IncuCyteZOOM®-assisted live cell imaging over a period
of 16 h (Figure 2A). Vac rapidly induced an increase in
caspase 3/7 activity, reaching a maximum after 6 h (Figure
2A). Vac-induced caspase 3/7 activation is sensitive to
exogenous ATP. When the two time curves were compared
over the period 0–16 h, differences determined by twoway ANOVA were highly significant (p<0.0001); Figure

Vac induces cell death through caspase
3/7 activation but cell death remains
morphologically distinct from apoptosis
induced by staurosporine (STS)

inhibitor (Figure 4B) or the selective P2X7 inhibitor
A-438079 (Figure 4C). Both inhibitors increased the
ATP-mediated counter regulatory effect on Vac-induced
cell death. These findings imply that purinergic signaling
does not contribute to the observed ATP-related counter
regulatory effect. Similar to arguments communicated in
a recent study by Noerenberg et al. [13], we addressed
the ubiquitously expressed TRPM7 to explain the ATPmediated salvage effect on Vac-induced cell death. To
prove the involvement of TRPM7, we applied carvacrol
as a reversible TRPM7 inhibitor.

To compare Vac-induced cell death with typical
apoptosis, cells were treated with either 7 μM Vac or
1 μM STS. STS is a potent inducer of caspase 3/7 and
apoptosis [21]. Cell death was monitored over time (20
h) by PI staining and IncuCyteZOOM®-assisted live
cell imaging (Figure 3A). Although both STS- and Vacinduced cell death, according to PI uptake this was delayed
with STS compared to Vac (Figure 3A). Luminescencebased caspase 3/7 assays showed increased caspase 3/7
activity by STS after 4 h (t-test, p=0.0038: STS vs.Vac).
To summarize, despite caspase 3/7 activation, Vacinducible cell death at 7 μM did not lead to an apoptotic
phenotype, which includes nuclear fragmentation;
instead, glioblastoma cells died by vacuolization and
eventual rupture of the plasma membrane (Figures 3C,
3D; Supplementary Figure 2), facilitating rapid PI uptake
(Figures 1A, Supplementary Figure 2). In #12537GB, these effects occurred earlier than in STS-induced
apoptosis. Therefore, Vac-induced cell death appears
to circumvent apoptosis but does involve caspase3/7
activation. Co-incubation with the pan-caspase inhibitor
carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]fluoromethylketone (zVAD-FMK) (40 μM) (Promega.
com, USA) resulted in a delay of Vac-induced cell death
(two-way ANOVA, p<0.0001; Supplementary Figure 3).
Even in the presence of the caspase inhibitor, 100% cell
death occurred later, suggesting a cooperative effect of
caspase activities in Vac-induced cell death.

Carvacrol supports Vac-induced cell death
and prevents the ATP-mediated recovery
effect on Vac
In our approach to test the involvement of
TRPM7, we quantified its expression by quantitative
real-time PCR (qPCR) in glioma cell lines (#12537GB, U-87) as well as in DPSCs. Accordingly, all cell
lines expressed TRPM7, but expression in glioma
cell lines (#12537-GB, U-87) was stronger than in
dental stem cells (DPSCs) (Supplementary Figure 5).
Moreover, the Vac-induced cell death and the observed
ATP-mediated inhibitory effect on Vac-induced cell
death were sensitive to carvacrol when co-incubated
at 50 μM and 100 μM (Figure 5A). Cell death was
monitored from 0–24 h. Carvacrol at 100 μM alone did
not affect baseline glioma cell viability, but significantly
stimulated 7 μM Vac-induced glioma cell death (twoway ANOVA, p<.0.0001: Vac/Vac+carvacrol 100 μM;
Figure 5A). Moreover, 50 μM and 100 μM carvacrol
impaired the ATP- (1 mM) mediated recovery effect on
Vac-induced cell death (two-way ANOVA, p<0.0001)
(Figure 5B). Figure 5C summarizes the quantitative
differences on glioma cell death of Vac and the influence
of ATP (1 mM) and carvacrol (50 μM and 100 μM) after
8 h, the time of greatest increment values. Because
carvacrol blocks TRPM7, these results suggest that the
ATP effects were mediated through TRPM7.

Vac-induced cell death is sensitive to
micromolar ATP levels
Purinergic receptors differ in ATP binding affinities
(reviewed in [12]), and receptor involvement may be
deduced by determination of the ATP concentration
with the greatest biological effect. Of note, using flow
cytometry, P2X4 and P2X7 expression was verified in
#12537-GB (Supplementary Figure 4).
Therefore, ATP was titrated between 10 nM and
1 mM into cultures with and without a constant Vac
concentration of 7 μM (Figure 4A). Co-titration of 1 μM,
10 μM, 100 μM and 1 mM ATP led to significantly reduced
PI uptake compared to Vac alone (two-way ANOVA,
p<0.0001). By contrast, 100 nM ATP had no effect on
Vac-induced cell death, whereas as little as 10 nM ATP
resulted in a significant increase of Vac-induced cell death
(two-way ANOVA, p<0.0001; Figure 4A). Multiple ATPbinding receptors differing in ATP binding affinities may
be involved. To specifically address the involvement
of purinergic receptors on the ATP-mediated salvage
effect, we added suramin as a universal P2-receptor
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Hypothetical mechanism of action
According to our current working hypothesis, which
is schematically displayed in Figure 6, Vac induces massive
vacuolization (V) followed by cell death, which is due
to either inefficient vacuole-lysosome fusion or impaired
degradation and extrusion of vacuole contents by the
CD63 vesicles. Ion-flux induced by exogenous ATP in turn
induces calcium-signaling in Fura-2 labeled #12537-GB
cells (Supplementary Figure 6). Exogenous ATP activates
TRPM7, Ca++/Mg++ influx, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) activation, which promotes vesicle fusion (V) with
lysosomes (L), and subsequent degradation by CD63-targeted
extrusion. TRPM7-specific effects are sensitive to carvacrol,
which stimulates TRPM7-related cell death in GBM.

DISCUSSION

apoptosis [8] and displays intensive cell blebbing followed
by immediate plasma-membrane rupture and subsequent
PI uptake (Figures 1, 3 and Supplementary Figure 2), the
latter is more a feature of necrosis [22]. This novel form
of cell death was recently termed as methuosis [23]. These
observations correspond with previous findings described
by Kitambi et al. [8].
Cell death determined by PI-stained nuclei is
significantly delayed in the presence of exogenous ATP.
When we determined cell proliferation by confluence
measurements (Supplementary Figure 7), the effect
of ATP appeared to be independent from increased
proliferation. However, in a different study, a growthpromoting effect by ATP was reported in gliomas [14],
which makes additional investigations necessary to

The present investigation documents rapid Vacinduced cell death in the commercially available U-87
cell line and the highly malignant glioma cell line
#12537-GB, whereas non-malignant DPSCs remained
unaffected. These findings mirror observations by
Kitambi and colleagues on the highly specific action by
Vac on GBM using established cell lines and their own
isolates, but without affecting mouse embryonic stem
cells, fibroblasts, mouse astrocytes and neurons [8]. The
live cell imaging system IncuCyteZOOM® serves as
a powerful tool for observing cell death in glioma cell
lines, both morphologically and quantitatively (Figures
1–5). Vac-induced cell death is clearly independent from

address ATP-responsive receptors and pathways in GBM.
Because Vac likely acts similarly to small molecules
of the chalcone family, which also mediate methuosis
in GBM, a similar pathway may be involved [23–26].
According to Overmeyer and Maltese, methuosis induced
by chalcones is Ras dependent [26] but the action profile
of Vac has not been tested for Ras dependency. However,
Kitambi and colleagues demonstrated that methuosis
induced by Vac is MKK4 dependent [8], downstream of
Ras/Rac-1 activation. In summary, further experiments
need to address Ras/Rac-1/MKK4 signaling induced by
both Vac and chalcones and its role in transformed and
non-transformed cells. We here demonstrated that Vac
is non-toxic against non-transformed DPSCs (Figure
1C), a potent regenerative stem-cell source [27]. Results
confirmed previous observations regarding non-toxic
effects on non-transformed tissues by Vac [8, 23]. Ras/
Rac-1 and eventually MKK4 signaling may constitute
a GBM-specific weak point exploited by these drugs.

Overexpression of Rac-1 in GBM is likely to affect
phagosome-lysosome fusion/degradation as schematically
shown in Figure 6 [21, 22]. Accordingly, the GBMspecific deficiency in late phagosome (CD63+) [29]
degradation results in methuosis by increased vacuole
fusion events. Hypothetically (Figure 6), the ATP-recovery
effect is mediated by purinergic receptors or TRPM
channel family members, leading to Ca++ and Mg++ influx
and PI3K activation. The latter may improve phagosome
maturation and degradation [30, 31], and thereby attenuate
the cytotoxic effect of Vac.
Vac-induced methuosis in GBM (#12537-GB and
U-87) also involves caspase 3/7, as demonstrated in Figure
2, corresponding to results of Overmeyer and colleagues
[23,24]. In detail, caspase 3 activation was restricted to
glioma cells already being detached from the surface [24].
However, caspase 3/7 is not essential for methuotic cell
death [8, 26]. According to Kitambi and colleagues, Vac
does not induce caspase 3/7 activation [8]. By contrast, we

found that Vac induces caspase 3/7 activation (Figures 2,
3). In our caspase 3/7 assays (Promega chemiluminescent
assay and IncuCyteZOOM®-based video microscopy),
we analyzed caspase 3/7 activity in both attached and
detached cells. One possible explanation for our different
findings regarding Vac-induced caspase 3/7 activity
could be that Kitambi and colleagues excluded the
detached cells in their caspase assays. Although caspase
3/7 is not essential for methuotic cell death [8, 22], we
found that caspase 3/7 activation as well as endogenous
caspase 3/7 activity is counter regulated by exogenous
ATP (Figure 2). In the glioma cell line #12537-GB, Vacinduced caspase 3/7 activation and STS-induced apoptosis
occur within a similar time frame (Figures 2, 3, [32,33]).
However, the number of PI-positive nuclei in STS- and
Vac-treated glioma cells differed between Vac- and STSinduced cell death (Figure 3A). Nuclear fragmentation, a

characteristic of apoptotic cell death, was not observed in
Vac-treated #12537-GB cells (Figures 3, Supplementary
Figure 2), corresponding to observations by Overmeyer
and colleagues [26]. Taken together, Vac induces a
necrotic-like cell death (methuosis) through sharing
vacuolization and caspase 3/7 activation (but no other
features) characterizing apoptotic cell death. Caspase-3
activation has been reported to be involved in autophagic
cell death [34]. Of note, autophagic cell death features
vacuolization [35] and plasma-membrane rupture [36],
considerable resembling the observation reported herein
for Vac-induced cell death in GBM. However, whether
autophagy plays a role in Vac-induced cell death awaits
further experiments.
Titration of different ATP concentrations into
#12537-GB Vac assays antagonized Vac-induced cell
death already from only 1 μM ATP (Figure 4A). By

little if any effect (100 nM ATP), or even increased (10
nM ATP) Vac-induced cell death (Figure 4A).

have been reported to occur in vivo in the extracellular
space under pathophysiological conditions, including
hypoxia [37]. Our findings suggest the contribution of
different ATP receptors with distinct ATP affinities in
preventing or increasing the Vac-induced cell death.
P2X4 and P2X7 have been identified in #12537-GB
(Supplementary Figure 4).
ATP at 1–10 μM potentially activates P2X1, P2X2,
P2X3, P2X4, P2X5 and P2X6, whereas P2X7 possesses
lower affinity (EC50>100 μM) [12, 38]. In addition to
the ionotropic P2X receptors, ATP acts as an agonist on
the metabotropic P2Y receptors: P2Y2, (EC50=100 nM),
P2Y11 (EC50=17 μM) and P2Y13 (EC50=260 μM) [38].
To address the involvement of purinergic receptors, we
applied 30 μM suramin, a nonselective potent inhibitor
of P2 receptors [12, 14] and the selective P2X7 inhibitor
A-438079 [12]. Both inhibitors failed to impair the
recovery effect of 1 mM ATP on Vac-induced cell

death (Figure 4B, 4C, respectively). By contrast, these
inhibitors even increased the ATP-mediated recovery
effect on Vac-induced cell death. These findings suggest
that purinergic signaling does not contribute to the
observed ATP-related counter regulatory effect at 1 mM
ATP. Indeed, the simple observation that a complete
salvage effect by ATP (TRPM7 mediated) could not been
obtained can be explained by the function of purinergic
receptors. This explanation is supported by experiments
performed in the presence of suramin or A-438079 (see
above, Figure 4B, 4C).
Overall, the ATP-inducible and carvacrol-sensitive
ion channel TRPM7 plays a major role in Vac-induced
methuosis (Figure 5), as exemplified by Chen et al. [19].
TRPM7 is frequently overexpressed in malignant cells as
well as in our glioma cell lines (Supplementary Figure 5).
Activation by exogenous ATP [13] stimulates the influx of
divalent metal ions (e.g. Ca++ and Mg++) [39, 40], which is
essential for mammalian Mg++ homeostasis [41]. Recently,
an important influence of TRPM7-mediated Mg++ influx
on PI3K activity was reported by Sahni and Scharenberg
[42]. Because PI3K activation leads to improved

Figure 6: TRPM7-guided signaling in ATP-mediated counter regulation of Vac-induced cell death in GBM,
hypothetical mode of action. Fluorescence-based light microscopy and trans electron-microscopical imaging showed that Vac leads to
massive vacuolization (V) related to macropinocytosis and autophagy, followed by cell death. This cartoon hypothesizes that exogenous
ATP may activate Ca-signaling by TRPM7 activation, Ca++and Mg++ influx and PI3K activation, which may promote vesicle fusion (V) with
lysosomes (L), and subsequent degradation by CD63-targeted vesicle extrusion. TRPM7-specific effects by exogenous ATP are sensitive to
carvacrol, an effective inhibitor of TRPM7-related signaling in GBM.

endosomal trafficking (Figure 6, [30, 31]), this may at
least in part explain the ATP-mediated recovery effect on
Vac-induced methuosis. Indeed, inhibition of the observed
ATP-mediated inhibitory effect on the Vac-induced cell
death by carvacrol emphasizes the involvement of TRPM7
(Figures 5, 6) [19]. Further compounds that inhibit
TRPM7 are currently being investigated to further confirm
the role of TRPM7 in methuosis [43].
Vac induces a dramatic cell death featuring rupture
of the plasma membrane, termed methuosis. Extracellular
ATP, an important danger signal in cancer [20], might
limit Vac-induced cell death when Vac is applied in vivo.
A remarkable feature of GBM with a highly unfavorable
outcome [9] are the large necrotic foci [44], which may be
a source of extracellular ATP [11, 45]. Therefore necrotic
areas constitute a potentially important prognostic factor to
be considered for the development of Vac-based treatment
protocols in future.
In conclusion, Vac induces a non-apoptotic
cell death despite caspase 3/7 activation in glioma
cells but does not affect the viability of multipotent
DPSCs. According to our findings, Vac-induced cell
death is highly efficient when compared to established
apoptosis inducing drugs like Temozolomide. However,
methuosis induced by Vac is sensitive to extracellular
ATP likely mediated by TRPM7 activation. Accordingly,
TRPM7 inhibition may be considered as an important
therapeutic option improving Vac-induced methuosis
once Vac enters the clinical phase. Although promising,
such in-vitro studies remain limited unless an
appropriate transfer to a clinically relevant model can
been achieved.

The glioma cell line #12537-GB (passage >100)
was established from a 63 year-old male patient diagnosed
with temporo-parietal (right) localized primary GBM
(World Health Organization Grade IV) with a sarcomatous
component, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 wild type, O6methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase not methylated
and with multiple chromosomal aberrations. The tumor
material was derived from a relapse (localization temperooccipital, left), which occurred 5 months after surgical
resection followed by adjuvant radiochemotherapy (3
cycles Temozolomide, radiation: 60 Gy). The recurrent
tumor (WHO grade IV) displayed necrotic regions
characteristic for GBM. The phenotype of the cell line
derived from this tumor material was assessed by flow
cytometry comprising surface (Supplementary Table
1) and cytoplasmic staining (Supplementary Table 2).
Results were compared with the commercially available
glioma cell line U-87 (ATCC.org) and DPSCs (passage 3)
established in this laboratory.

Experiments using the IncuCyteZOOM®
incubator microscope
For stimulation experiments, cells were trypsinized
and seeded into transparent flat-bottom 96-well plates
(NUNC) at a seeding density of 5,000–cells/well. For
IncuCyte experiments, cells were cultured in phenol red
and riboflavin-free FluoroBrite Dulbecco's Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM) medium (ThermoFisher.com)
supplemented with 10% FCS, GlutaMAX and antibiotics
at 37°C under 5% CO2. Vac (Sellekchem.com, Germany)
was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma.
com, USA) to a concentration of 76 mM (155 μl were
added to 5 mg Vac). ATP (Invivogen.com) was dissolved
in sterile water to a concentration of 100 mM. Dilutions
were made using FluoroBrite DMEM medium. Semiconfluent cell layers seeded into 96-well flat-bottomed
microtiter plates (ThermoFisher.com) were treated with
a final concentration of 7 μM Vac in the presence of 10
μg/ml PI (Sigma.com) with and without ATP, carvacrol
(Sigma.com), suramin (Tocris/Biotechné.com, UK) or
A-438079 (Sellekchem.com). Controls were performed
with 10−4 DMSO diluted in medium no toxic effects on
glioma cell lines or DPSCs.
After adding the reagents, the plate was inserted
into the IncuCyteZOOM® (Essenbio.com, USA). Cell
death was quantified as the mean total red integrated
fluorescence intensity per image (relative color units
(RCU) × μM2/image). Data were collected and visualized
using GraphPad Prism 7 software. The kinetics of caspase
3/7 activities were determined by the IncuCyte caspase
3/7 assay http://www.essenbioscience.com/en/products/
reagents-consumables/incucyte-96-well-kinetic-caspase37-apoptosis-assay-kit/ Caspase 3/7 activity is presented
graphically as the mean total green integrated fluorescence
intensity (RCU × μM2/image).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
The glioma cell line #12537-GB was established
from primary tumor material as described below (approved
by the local Ethics Committee of the University Hospital
Ulm; universal trial number: U111-1179-3127) with
patient-informed consent. The tumor material was minced
and cells from the tumor material were taken into culture
by trypsinization of the tumor material (2.5% trypsin),
followed by Ficoll separation. Continuous cultures were
performed in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium
(IMDM) (Lonza.com, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum (FCS, endotoxin-free, Batch 0247x, Merck/
Biochrom.com, Germany), GlutaMAX (ThermoFisher.
com, USA) and antibiotics at 37°C under 5% CO2. Two
volunteers donated their third molars to establish DPSCs.
Pulpa tissue was mechanically dissected and trypsinized
from the third molars, followed by culture in IMDM
containing 10% endotoxin-free FCS (Batch No.: 0247x,
Merck/Biochrom.com), further details were according to
Cvicl et al. [46].

Caspase-Glo® 3/7 assay

Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)

Cells were seeded into white non-transparent
LumiNunc 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates
(ThermoFisher.com) at a density of 5,000 cells per well
and treated with the respective Vac and ATP concentrations
following incubation for 2–6h at 37°C under 5% CO2.
Thereafter, plates were adjusted to room temperature
and Caspase-Glo® 3/7 reagent was added to all wells.
Luminescence was determined after 30 min or longer
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega.com,
USA). The read-out of the luminescence signal (RLUs)
was obtained using a GloMax® 96 Microplate luminometer
(Promega.com).

Total RNA was extracted using the Maxwell®
16 LEV simply RNA kit (Promega.com) according to
the manufacturer’s instruction. In total, 400 ng RNA
were used for cDNA first-strand synthesis using the
GoScript Reverse Transcription System (Promega.com)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. cDNA was
diluted 1/10 for qPCR; 4 μl were used for qPCR. qPCR
was performed using TaqMan Gene expression assays
(RPL13: Hs00744303_s1, TRPM7: Hs00559080_m1)
and a StepOne System (ThermoFisher.com) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR conditions: 2min 50°C,
10min 95°C followed by 40 cycles comprising 15s 95°C
(denaturation) and 1min 60°C (annealing/extension). Data
are presented as fold change (Relative Quantity (RQ))
relative to RPL13 as endogenous control. DPSCs were
used as the reference sample. Technical triplicates were
performed.

Phenotype of #12537-GB: P2X1, P2X4 and P2X7
P2X1 (APR-001), P2X4 (APR-002) and P2X7
(APR-004) antibodies were purchased from Alomone
(Alomone.com, Israel). For flow cytometry, cells
were detached using accutase (Sigma.com). For each
staining tube, 1×104 cells were used. Cells were fixed
and permeabilized using Perm/Fix (BDbiosciences.
com, USA), followed by two washes with Perm/Wash
(BDbiosciences.com) and stained using the respective
antibodies, washed with sodium azide buffer (0.01%
NaN3 and 0.025% FCS) and fixed with BD CellFix
(BDbiosciences.com). For P2X1 and P2X4, cells were
stained using secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit
antibody (IgG F(ab’)2 fragment adsorbed for human
proteins), Rockland.com, USA). Secondary antibody
staining alone served as negative controls. Ten thousands
cells were counted with a FACSCalibur (BDbiosciences.
com). Evaluation was performed using Cellquest software
v5 (BDbiosciences.com) and FlowJo software v10
(FlowJo.com, USA).

Electron microscopy
Sapphire discs (Engineering Office M. Wohlwend
GmbH, Switzerland) were used as support for the
adherent glioma cell culture. The 0.170-mm thick
discs were cleaned by sonication for 15 min each in
60% sulfuric acid, soapy water and twice in absolute
ethanol, and allowed to dry. The discs were then coated
with approximately 20 nm carbon by electron-beam
evaporation and dried for 8 h or overnight in an oven
at 120°C to increase the carbon-film stability. The
coated sapphire discs were then carefully immersed
in complete medium and the cells were seeded on top.
A 50-μm gold spacer ring (diameter 3.05 mm, central
bore 2 mm; Plano GmbH, Germany) was mounted in
between two coated sapphire discs with the cells grown
on them, similar to the protocol introduced by Hawes
et al. [47]. These sandwiches were high-pressure frozen
without aluminum planchettes and without the use
of hexadecene. Freeze substitution was performed as
described in Walther and Ziegler [48] and Buser and
Walther [49] with a substitution medium consisting
of acetone with 0.2% osmium tetroxide, 0.1% uranyl
acetate and 5% water for 19 h. During this time period,
the temperature was exponentially raised from 183 K to
273 K. After substitution, the samples were maintained
at room temperature for 30 min and then washed twice
with acetone. After stepwise embedding of the samples
in Epon (Fluka.com, USA) (polymerization at 333 K
within 72 h), they were cut using a microtome (Leica
Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome) with a diamond knife
(Diatome, Switzerland) to semi-thin sections with a
nominal thickness of 500 nm or 1 μm, as measured from
the readout of the microtome. Specimens were examined
using a JEOL 1400 (JEOL.com, Germany) at 120 keV.

Flow cytometry for glioma cell lines and DPSC
For cytoplasmic staining, cells were fixed
and permeabilized using Perm/Fix (BDbiosciences.
com), followed by two washes with Perm/Wash
(BDbiosciences.com) and stained for 20 min using the
respective antibodies (Supplementary Table 2, 3), washed
with sodium azide buffer and fixed with BD CellFix
(1×). For surface staining, cells were detached using
accutase (Sigma.com) and stained with the respective
antibodies (Supplementary Table 1, 3), washed with
sodium azide buffer and fixed with BD CellFix (1×).
Ten thousands cells were counted with a FACSCalibur
(BDbiosciences.com). Evaluation was performed
using Cellquest software (BDbiosciences.com). Mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) values were calculated
using the following formula: % positive of gated cells x
X-mean or Y-mean.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using
GraphPadPrism v7 (Graphpad.com, USA). To identify
significant differences between treatments over the entire
time frame, regular two-way ANOVA was performed.
P-values of single time points of kinetics were calculated
by multiple comparison tests after two-way ANOVA.
Sidak’s correction was applied to correct for multiple
comparisons. P-values of caspase 3/7 Glo assays were
calculated using unpaired two-tailed t-test with Welch’s
correction. Observations with p<0.05 were considered as
significant.
