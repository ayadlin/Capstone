Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis specifically in
tumor cells and its efficacy has been tested in pre-clinical models by delivering it systemically as a
purified ligand or via engineered stem cells (SC). However, about 50% of tumor lines are resistant
to TRAIL and overcoming TRAIL resistance in aggressive tumors, such as glioblastomamultiforme (GBM), and understanding the molecular dynamics of TRAIL-based combination
therapies are critical to broadly use TRAIL as a therapeutic agent. In this study, we developed
death receptor (DR)4/5-reporters that offer an imaging-based platform to identify agents that act in
concert with a potent, secretable variant of TRAIL (S-TRAIL) by monitoring changes in DR4/5
expression. Utilizing these reporters, we show a differential regulation of DR4/5 when exposed to
a panel of clinically relevant agents. A histone deacetylase inhibitor, MS-275, resulted in
upregulation of DR4/5 in all GBM cell lines, and these changes could be followed in real time
both in vitro and in vivo in mice bearing tumors and they correlated with increased TRAIL
sensitivity. To further assess the dynamics of combinatorial strategies that overcome resistance of
tumors to SC released S-TRAIL, we also engineered tumor cells to express live-cell caspasereporters and SCs to express S-TRAIL. Utilizing DR4/5 and caspase reporters in parallel, we show
that MS-275 sensitizes TRAIL-resistant GBM cells to stem cell (SC) delivered S-TRAIL by
changing the time-to-death in vitro and in vivo. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a
combination of real-time reporters of TRAIL-induced apoptosis pathway in evaluating the efficacy
of SC-TRAIL-based therapeutics and may have implications in targeting a broad range of cancers.

INTRODUCTION
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Glioblastoma-multiforme (GBM) is a very aggressive brain tumor, with a median survival of
only 15 months after diagnosis.1 Poor delivery of therapeutics to the disease site and the
resistance of tumor cells to different therapeutics are among the major obstacles to
successful anti-GBM therapies. Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) has emerged as a prime candidate for the treatment of several cancers because of
its ability to induce apoptosis in a tumor-specific manner.2 Both soluble recombinant human
TRAIL ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL/ dulanermin), and TRAIL receptor agonist monoclonal
antibodies (mapatumumab, lexatumumab), have shown promise in pre-clinical studies of
solid tumors and are currently being evaluated in clinical trials.2 Although these
systemically delivered agents have clinical potential, their utility and broad applicability is
likely limited by several factors, such as: (a) the difficulty of delivering sufficient TRAIL or
agonist antibodies to tumors while minimizing toxicity; (b) the short biological half-life and
rapid clearance of recombinant TRAIL, requiring repeated administration; and (c)
insensitivity of many tumors to TRAIL receptor activation with ligand or antibodies.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

TRAIL induces apoptosis by binding to death receptors 4 (DR4) and 5 (DR5), leading to
formation of death inducing signaling complexes and activation of initiator and effector
caspases (Caspases 8 and 10, and 3 and 7, respectively).3 We have shown that both neural
stem cells (NSCs) and mesenchymal SCs can be engineered to express TRAIL at high levels
without themselves being killed and have extensive migratory capacity towards GBMs.4,5 In
mouse models, on-site delivery of S-TRAIL by stem cells (SC) has substantial efficacy in
solid and invasive GBM5–7 suggesting superior delivery of SC-S-TRAIL compared with
systemically delivered TRAIL. Real-time in vitro and in vivo analysis that allow
identification of therapies that prime TRAIL-resistant GBMs to SC-S-TRAIL and also a
thorough understanding of the dynamics of combinatorial strategies that overcome
resistance of tumors to SC-S-TRAIL are crucial for development of broadly effective
TRAIL-based therapies.
In this study, we assessed the dynamics of apoptosis in GBM cells in response to NSCTRAIL using live-cell reporters of caspases in GBM-NSC co-culture systems. To target a
broad spectrum of GBMs, we developed optical imaging-based DR4/5-reporters to identify
small molecule activators of TRAIL receptor expression and assess the ability of these
agents to combine with SC-TRAIL in killing GBMs in vitro and in vivo.

RESULTS
GBM cells exhibit differential responses to TRAIL in vitro, in co-cultures and in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To demonstrate heterogeneity in the TRAIL response by GBMs, we utilized three GBM
lines, Gli36-EvIII, U251 and LN229, that have varying sensitivity/resistance to TRAIL
(Figure 1a) and developed GBM-NSC co-cultures where S-TRAIL (from here on called
TRAIL) was continuously secreted by NSCs in the vicinity of tumor cells. GBM cells were
engineered to express firefly luciferase (Fluc) and mCherry (herein referred as GBM-FmC)
and NSCs were engineered to express fluorescent markers of cell identity (GFP) or TRAIL
coupled to an IRES-GFP, using bicistronic lentiviral vectors (Supplementary Table 1;
Supplementary Figures S1a and b). Co-culturing GBM cells (as monolayers) and NSCs (as
neurospheres) revealed that neurospheres first attach to the GBM monolayers, and
individual NSCs then disseminate towards the GBM cells, closely mimicking their in vivo
migratory behavior (Supplementary Video 1). Real-time imaging of these co-cultures
demonstrated that NSC-TRAIL-induced death of Gli36-EvIII-FmC and U251-FmC cells,
but not of LN229-FmC cells (Figure 1b; Supplementary Video 2; Supplementary Figure
S1c). Consistent with these observations, the viability of Gli36-EvIII-FmC and U251-FmC

cells, but not of LN229-FmC cells, was markedly reduced in NSC-TRAIL co-cultures as
measured by their Fluc activity (Figure 1c). AnnexinV staining on GBM cells showed that
TRAIL-sensitive Gli36-EvIII and U251 exhibited significantly more AnnexinV positivity
than TRAIL-resistant LN229 cells when treated with TRAIL released by NSCs (Figure 1d).
To further assess whether the death of TRAIL-sensitive GBM cells induced by NSC-TRAIL
was apoptosis mediated, we engineered TRAIL-sensitive GBM lines to express a
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization live-cell reporter in which the
mitochondrial import sequence of SMAC/DIABLO was fused to red fluorescent protein
(RFP)8 (Supplementary Figure S2a). Engineered Gli36-EvIII and U251 displayed typical
apoptotic morphology and showed diffusion of RFP from mitochondria to cytoplasm at the
time of apoptotic cell death when co-cultured with NSC-TRAIL (Supplementary Figures
S2b–d).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To also measure the differences of TRAIL response of GBM cells in vivo, Gli36-EvIIIFmC, U251-FmC and LN229-FmC tumors were established in mice. Despite the efficacy of
purified TRAIL in vitro, a side-by-side comparison of systemically delivered TRAIL and
NSC-TRAIL showed that the recombinant ligand did not have a significant effect on the
volumes of even TRAIL-sensitive Gli36-EvIII-FmC xenografts, but intratumoral
implantation of NSC-TRAIL significantly reduced tumor volumes and was well-tolerated
(Supplementary Figure S3). U251-FmC tumors also exhibited a significant reduction in
tumor volumes when exposed to NSC-TRAIL but LN229-FmC tumors did not shrink
implying that they were resistant to NSC-TRAIL in vivo (Figure 1e). Quantitative RT–PCR
and western blot analyses revealed a correlation between the TRAIL sensitivity and DR4
and DR5 expression across the three cell lines tested (Figures 1f and g). These results show
that NSC-mediated delivery of TRAIL is potent in inducing apoptosis in TRAIL-sensitive
GBM cells and that the extent of apoptosis is correlated with endogenous DR4 and DR5
expression levels among the GBM lines.
Imaging of death-receptor expression levels identifies modulators of TRAIL sensitivity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further investigate the link between DR4 and DR5 levels and the TRAIL responsiveness
of GBM cells, we engineered lentiviral-based DR4/DR5 promoter-Fluc and RlucDsRed2
reporters that simultaneously allow real-time monitoring of DR4/5 expression and tumor cell
viability in vitro and in vivo. We generated GBM lines (Supplementary Table 1; hereafter
GBM-pDR4-Fl-CMV-RlD and GBM-pDR5-Fl-CMV-RlD, respectively) in which differing
DR4/5 expression levels were monitored by Fluc activity relative to Rluc and DsRed2
(which served as viability markers): Gli36-EvIII cells had the highest DR4 and DR5
expression and LN229 cells the lowest (Figures 2a and b), consistent with their endogenous
DR4 and DR5 expression (Figures 1f and g). To identify reagents that have the ability to
increase DR4 or DR5 expression and thereby had the potential to increase the
responsiveness of GBM cells to TRAIL, we established a screen using GBM-pDR4-FlCMV-RlD and GBM-pDR5-Fl-CMV-RlD cells and a small panel of compounds currently in
pre-clinical and clinical use. We chose reagents that target a wide range of pathways and
possess diverse therapeutic mechanisms.9–16 These compounds included the EGFR
inhibitors Cetuximab and Erlotinib; HDAC inhibitor MS-275; dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor
PI-103; C-Met inhibitor PHA665752; DNA alkylating agent Temozolomide; DNA
intercalating agent Doxorubicin; and TRAIL itself (Figures 2c and d). Upon exposure to
these compounds, a significant increase in pDR4 levels (1.14–2.54 fold of controls; Figure
2c) and pDR5 levels (1.10–3.14 fold of controls; Figure 2d) was observed, although levels
of pDR4 and pDR5 were not always correlated. MS-275 was the most effective agent in
increasing receptor expression and resulted in upregulation of both pDR4 and pDR5 in all
three lines (~2.4, 2.5 and 1.8-fold of pDR4 and 1.8, 1.5 and 3.1-fold of pDR5 activity in
Gli36-EvIII, U251 and LN229 cells, respectively). Western blot analysis on U251 cells

exposed to MS-275 further validated changes in DR4 and DR5 expression at the protein
level (Figure 2e). Flow cytometry analysis indicating the surface expression of DR4 and
DR5 showed marked changes in DR5 levels upon MS-275 exposure, and not in the DR4
levels (Figure 2f) probably due to the low endogenous expression of DR4. Taken together,
these results demonstrate that the DR4/DR5 reporter system, which allows monitoring of
DR4/5 expression and cell viability simultaneously, reflects the basal DR4 and DR5
expression levels in GBM cells and can further be utilized to identify modulators of DR
activity, such as MS-275, that have the potential to sensitize GBM cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis.
Live-cell imaging with apoptosis reporters demonstrates the dynamics of TRAIL-induced
GBM cell apoptosis and TRAIL sensitization

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In addition to correlating the differences of TRAIL response with DR4/5 expression, we
sought to understand how combinatorial strategies can prime tumor cells for execution of
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. We focused on MS-275 and tested its ability to alter apoptotic
response in GBM cells. The priming effect of MS-275 was evident in its ability to augment
the response of GBM cells to TRAIL as measured by caspase-3/7 assays (Figures 3a–c),
western blot analysis of caspase-8 and cleaved PARP (Figure 3d) and subsequent changes in
cell viability (Supplementary Figure S4). MS-275 treatment alone did not have a direct
effect on the AnnexinV positivity of GBM cells, but it markedly increased the AnnexinV
positivity induced by TRAIL in intermediate TRAIL-sensitive U251 GBM cells (Figure 3e)
and to a lesser extent in TRAIL-resistant LN229 GBM cells (Supplementary Figure S5).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

While these end-point assays provide information about the overall effect of TRAIL-based
combinatorial approaches, they are unable to provide a thorough assessment of apoptosis at
a single cell level. To further characterize the real-time dynamics of apoptosis, we
engineered GBM lines to express a fluorescent reporter of effector caspase-3/7 activation, in
which the Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) donor-acceptor pair CFP and YFP are
linked by caspase cleavage sequence-DEVDR (ECRP) (Supplementary Table 1;
Supplementary Figure S6a).17 On the basis of our data from end-point assays, we first chose
U251 cells, an intermediate TRAIL-sensitive line. We engineered U251 cells with ECRP to
study the timing of caspase activation (U251-ECRP) (Supplementary Figure S6b). Live-cell
microscopy of U251-ECRP cells exposed to TRAIL revealed a delay of up to 10–12 h
followed by a sudden change in CFP/YFP ratio concomitant with morphological
manifestations of death, which was dose dependent exhibiting an inverse relationship
between the fraction of cells killed and the mean interval before caspase activation
(Supplementary Figures S6b–d). Combined exposure of U251-ECRP cells to MS-275 and
TRAIL caused a significant increase in the level of cell death (Figure 3f); shortened time-todeath (Figure 3h) and decreased the percentage of surviving cells (Figure 3i) as compared
with treatment with MS-275 or TRAIL alone. Representative FRET trajectories for the
ECRP also revealed the shorter interval before caspase activation with the MS-275 and
TRAIL treatment in combination (Figure 3g; Supplementary Videos 3 and 4). Taken
together, live-cell imaging of apoptosis reporters in GBMs demonstrates the dynamics of
TRAIL response and MS-275 induced TRAIL sensitization at a single cell level.
Live-cell imaging of GBM cell response to SC delivered TRAIL in GBM-NSC co-cultures
reveals the efficacy of MS-275 in sensitizing TRAIL-resistant tumors
Next, we examined the dynamics of caspase activation in NSC-GBM co-cultures, in which
TRAIL is continuously secreted by NSCs in the vicinity of tumor cells. We generated
additional NSC lines that express red markers of cell identity (NSC-mCh and NSC-TRAIL
that co-expresses IRES-mCherry; Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Figure S7a). We
observed a time-dependent accumulation of TRAIL in NSC-GBM co-cultures revealing the

sustained release of TRAIL from NSCs (Figure 4a). Live-cell imaging of caspase activation
in GBM-ECRP-NSC co-cultures revealed a significant reduction in GBM cell viability,
which was also evident by trajectories in FRET signal and time-to-death in the presence of
NSC-TRAIL (Supplementary Figures S7b–d). In these settings, Gli36-EvIII-ECRP and
U251-ECRP cells exhibited markedly shorter time-to-death and increased probability of
death as compared with the more resistant LN229-ECRP cells (Figure 4b). To determine
whether MS-275 would sensitize these highly resistant cells to NSC-TRAIL, we established
co-cultures of LN229-ECRP cells and NSCs (Figure 4c; Supplementary Videos 5 and 6).
Although fewer than 10% of LN229 cells underwent apoptosis in the presence of NSCTRAIL, adding MS-275 and NSC-TRAIL together increased the apoptotic cell number to
50% after 24 h (Figure 4d); enhanced killing of these cells was further confirmed by changes
in FRET trajectories in the MS-275 and NSC-TRAIL-treated group (Figure 4e). Importantly,
MS-275 treatment did not have a significant effect on the viability of NSC when assayed in
co-culture experiments or with MS-275 alone (Supplementary Figure S8). We conclude that
MS-275 cooperates with NSC-TRAIL in co-culture experiments to overcome TRAIL
resistance in non-responsive lines, such as LN229.
DR4 and DR5 reporters allow for the imaging of time-dependent changes in DR4/5
expression in TRAIL-resistant tumors in vitro and in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To test the timing of DR4/5 induction in TRAIL-resistant GBMs, we analyzed pDR4 and
pDR5 activities in LN229 cells. Treatment of LN229-pDR4-Fl-CMV-RlD and LN229pDR5-Fl-CMV-RlD reporter lines with MS-275 resulted in a dose- and time-dependent
upregulation of pDR4 and pDR5 (Figures 5a and b) activity. Similar changes in endogenous
mRNA levels were observed by quantitative RT–PCR (Figure 5c). Western blot analysis
further revealed changes in total protein expression levels of DR4 and DR5 upon MS-275
treatment (Figures 5d and e). However, flow cytometry analysis did not show such marked
changes in the surface expression of DR4 and DR5 upon MS-275 exposure, probably
because of the low endogenous expression of each receptor (Supplementary Figure S9). To
test the effect of MS-275 on DR4/5 expression in vivo, we established tumors with LN229pDR4-Fl-CMV-RlD and LN229-pDR5-Fl-CMV-RlD cells in mice and administered
MS-275 systemically. Sequential dual luciferase imaging of DR4/5 promoter activity (as
assessed by Fluc intensity) and changes in tumor volumes (as assessed by Rluc imaging)
was performed before or following MS-275 administration (Figure 5f). Under these
conditions, pDR4 and pDR5 reporter activities increased significantly with MS-275 as
compared with vehicle controls (Figure 5g). Similar changes in pDR5 reporter activities
were observed in Gli36 and U251 tumor lines in vivo (Supplementary Figure S10).
Quantitative RT–PCR on tumor tissues confirmed that DR4 and DR5 mRNA levels rose 2–5
fold following MS-275 administration (Figure 5h). Taken together, DR4/5-reporters allow
for the imaging of receptor upregulation, which provides the time window for TRAIL
sensitization for potential combination therapies in vivo.
Combination of MS-275 and SC-delivered TRAIL reveals efficacy in TRAIL-resistant GBMs
in vivo
Based on the MS-275-mediated upregulation of DR4 and DR5 in vivo, we aimed to test the
effect of NSC-TRAIL on TRAIL-resistant tumors following MS-275 administration (Figure
6a). To determine the effect of MS-275 on the TRAIL sensitivity of LN229-FmC tumors in
vivo, we performed two sets of experiments. First, tumor cells pre-treated with MS-275
were implanted, and treated with a single injection of NSC-TRAIL (Figure 6b). A
significant reduction in tumor volumes was observed with MS-275 and NSC-TRAIL as
compared with control tumors treated with NSC-TRAIL alone (Figure 6b). Second, mice
bearing established LN229-FmC tumors were administered MS-275 periodically and
implanted with NSC-TRAIL (Figure 6c). A significant decrease in tumor volumes was

observed as compared with vehicle and NSC-GFP/TRAIL treatment in combination with an
inert vehicle (Figure 6c). Immunofluorescent analysis of tumor sections showed that
mCherry labeled tumor cells were in close association with TRAIL expressing NSCs (GFP)
in the tumors (Figure 6d). Moreover, significantly higher number of cleaved caspase-3
positive tumor cells was observed in the presence of the MS-275 than in parallel controls
(Figures 6e and f). Taken together, our results show that MS-275 and NSC-TRAIL
combination therapy reveals efficacy in TRAIL-resistant GBMs in vivo.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we describe the development of DR4/5-reporters that offer an imaging-based
screening platform to identify agents that can act in concert with SC-TRAIL in vitro and
allow the monitoring of DR4/5-involved TRAIL sensitization in vivo. We also demonstrate
the use of live-cell caspase reporters to assess the effects of identified agents, such as
MS-275, on the SC-TRAIL response of GBM cells at a single cell level. Thoroughly
addressing the dynamics of such combinatorial strategies that overcome resistance of tumors
to TRAIL, we reveal the marked efficacy of MS-275 and SC delivered TRAIL in TRAILresistant GBMs in vitro and in vivo.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Activating apoptosis on tumor cells is a favorable approach to cancer treatment as it has the
potential to induce tumor regression as opposed to keeping tumor growth under control, a
common end point of anti-mitogenic drugs.18 Although, both soluble recombinant human
TRAIL protein and DR4/DR5 agonist monoclonal antibodies are currently being evaluated
in clinical trials,2 it appears that many TRAIL therapies are experiencing difficulties in
Phase I/II trials and to our knowledge, no pivotal Phase III trials are currently underway. We
have previously established an alternative method of TRAIL delivery involving engineered
stem cells, which are known to home to tumors and thereby serve as a localized delivery
vehicle for anti-tumor biomolecules.5 Our recent studies utilizing genetically engineered
fusions of TRAIL with imaging agents, have demonstrated the superior pharmacokinetic
properties of SC delivered TRAIL as compared with systemically administered soluble
TRAIL.6 In this study, we assessed the efficacy and in vivo utility of SC-TRAIL compared
with systemically delivered TRAIL and then focused on three primary issues: (1) analysis of
the variable apoptotic responses of GBM cells to TRAIL; (2) identifying small molecules
that sensitize GBM cells to SC-TRAIL by increasing expression of DR4 or DR5; and (3)
analysis of DR4 and DR5 modulation and subsequent TRAIL sensitization with combination
therapies in resistant GBMs.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumor cells have a varying response to TRAIL-mediated killing, for reasons that remain
partly understood. Our selected GBM lines displayed heterogeneity in their TRAIL
response, which was assessed by end-point viability and apoptosis assays as well as live-cell
apoptosis measurements in GBM-NSC co-cultures and in GBM xenografts. In an effort to
develop broadly applicable SC delivered TRAIL therapies, understanding the mechanisms
of TRAIL response and identifying new agents that overcome TRAIL resistance are critical.
Several reports suggest that the levels of DR4 and DR5 receptors constitute one important
factor in TRAIL sensitivity.19 In the subset of GBM cell lines we examined in this study,
sensitivity to SC delivered TRAIL correlated with levels of DR4 and DR5 expression,
consistent with the previous reports.20 While DR4 and DR5 expression levels are not the
sole determinants of TRAIL responsiveness, several TRAIL-sensitizing agents have been
reported to act mainly by upregulating DR expression.21–29 Based on this knowledge, in this
study, we generated DR4 and DR5 expression reporters as a means to monitor endogenous
DR4 and DR5 expression levels and to select reagents that can act in concert with TRAIL by
directly modulating DR expression. In our DR4/5 imaging-based screen with a small panel
of clinically relevant molecules, we show that the HDAC inhibitor (HDACi), MS-275, as a

very potent agent in upregulating DR4 and DR5 expression in all GBM cell lines, including
the TRAIL-resistant LN229 cells and sensitizing them to NSC-TRAIL-mediated apoptosis
both in vitro and in vivo. Our finding of MS-275 effect on TRAIL sensitization is consistent
with other reports showing the cooperation of HDAC inhibitors and TRAIL.30–32 It has also
been reported that MS-275 can directly modulate the acetylation status of histones 3 and 4 of
the DR promoters and facilitate the reversal of aberrant DR4/5 gene silencing.33 Although
the MS-275-induced TRAIL sensitization involves DR4/5 modulation as one mechanism, it
is still possible that MS-275 might also influence downstream effectors or modulators of the
apoptotic cascade. Therefore, it will be of high importance to assess these mechanisms of
TRAIL-sensitization mediated by molecules identified through our DR4/5 reporter system.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Our characterization of MS-275 serves as an example of how such a reagent can be
identified and utilized by directly assessing DR4 and DR5 expression levels, and provides a
potent combination therapy for TRAIL-resistant GBMs. Based on its ability to track cell
viability and DR4/5 regulation simultaneously by dual bioluminescence, our DR4/5 reporter
system can further be utilized in a high-throughput manner. This might offer another means
to find novel TRAIL sensitizers similar to the few high-throughput screens conducted
previously.34,35 Another advantage that our DR4/5 reporter system offers is the in vivo dual
bioluminescent imaging component. As shown in our TRAIL-resistant GBM xenografts,
differential bioluminescent imaging of Fluc and Rluc activity allows simultaneous
monitoring of DR4/5 expression and tumor volumes, respectively. The real-time monitoring
of changes in DR4/5 promoter activity upon treatment with agents that upregulate DR4/5
and ultimately tumor volumes upon TRAIL treatment is critical in understanding
combination therapies in TRAIL-resistant tumors in vivo.
The TRAIL-sensitizing ability of novel reagents identified through DR4/5-reporters should
be validated by parallel or consecutive cell viability or caspase assays in the presence of
TRAIL. To test the mechanism and efficacy of a TRAIL sensitizer in GBMs in this study,
we utilized GBM-NSC co-cultures where TRAIL was continuously delivered in the vicinity
of tumor cells in a sustained manner. Using a live-cell caspase reporter system that monitors
the effector caspase activity in GBM-NSC co-cultures, we confirmed the apoptosisaugmenting effect of MS-275 in TRAIL-sensitive and -resistant GBM cells. Therefore, realtime imaging of tumor cell apoptotic response to SC-TRAIL with TRAIL-sensitizing agents
might provide another means of assessment of TRAIL response in GBMs and other tumor
types.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It will be of high interest to extend our observations to panels of primary GBM lines and
different small molecule libraries to identify new compounds that primes TRAIL-resistant
cells for NSC-TRAIL-induced apoptosis. It will also be significant to utilize similar
strategies in other tumor types with varying TRAIL response. In conclusion, our study
shows that the combination of two different imaging modalities can provide a detailed
understanding of TRAIL response among tumor cell lines in real-time, the identification of
modulators of TRAIL response, and imaging of all these events in vitro and in vivo.

transduced at MOI of five. Populations of transduced cells were visualized by fluorescence
microscopy for GFP, CFP, YFP, DsRed2, RFP or mCherry expression. GBM-ECRP cells

(0.3 × 105/well; Matrical Bioscience, Spokane, WA, USA) plates and grown to 80%
confluence. NSCs (0.5 × 105 cells/neurosphere) were added on top of GBM monolayers in
NSC medium. Co-cultures were then analyzed by (a) live-cell imaging starting at 2 h after
NSC addition; or by (b) bioluminescence imaging after 24–72 h. For combination
experiments, GBM cells were treated with MS-275 (0–5 μM) before NSC addition.
Live-cell imaging and image analysis
GBM cells were grown on glass-bottom 96-well plates (Matrical Bioscience) for 24 h in
complete medium. Before imaging, medium was replaced with phenol-red free DMEM

supplemented with 0.2% FBS and penicillin–streptomycin. S-TRAIL (0–200 ng/ml) was
added and time is depicted at t = 0. Cells were imaged at 37 °C on Nikon TE2000E
Automated Inverted Microscope with perfect focus function, and temperature and CO2
control chamber using ×20 objective, as described.38 CFP, YFP, GFP, mCherry, RFP or
phase images were acquired at 4 or 9 min intervals for 16–72 h. The loss in intramolecular
FRET was monitored by the change in CFP/YFP ratio, measured using ImageJ software
(NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) with a custom-made plug-in, and plotted as trajectories as
described.38 The time of death was determined based on apoptotic morphology and analyzed
by ImageJ with a special plug-in. The percentage of cell survival was determined by
counting the number of live cells/field in the beginning and end of the imaging. Time-to
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization analysis was performed by measuring the
time of localization change of the IMS-RP reporter from punctate to diffuse.
Dual bioluminescent imaging

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For in vitro detection of promoter activities, D-Luciferin (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA, 100
μg/ml) and coelenterazine (Nanolight, Pinetop, AZ, USA, 1 μg/ml) were added on 40 000
cells/well in 96-well plates (Costar) in triplicates and Fluc/Rluc ratio was determined. For
drug treatments, cells were treated 24–72 h before measuring Fluc/Rluc ratio. For in vivo
imaging of the reporters, mice bearing GBMs were first imaged for Rluc activity by
administering i.p. coelenterazine (CaliperLS, Xenolight, Hopkinton, MA, USA), followed
by Fluc measurement 6 h later as described.36 Data were analyzed by measuring Fluc to
Rluc ratio at the beginning (day 0) and end of the experiment and presented as fold of day 0.
Cell viability/caspase assays and detection of apoptosis
The effects of TRAIL on GBM cell viability and caspase-3/7 activity were measured using
CellTiterGlo and CaspaseGlo 3/7 (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) 24-h post treatment. For
combination experiments, GBM cells were treated with MS-275 (0–5 μM) for 24 h before
TRAIL treatment. All experiments were performed in triplicates. Apoptosis was determined
by measuring AnnexinV positivity using dead cell apoptosis kit with Alexa488-AnnexinV
and propidium iodide (PI) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Flow cytometry was performed using FACSAria Ilu cell sorter and results were
analyzed by FlowJo software (Flowjo, Ashland, OR, USA).
Western blotting and ELISA

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Following sequential treatment with MS-275 and S-TRAIL (24 h) GBM cells were lysed
with NP40 buffer supplemented with protease (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and
phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). Thirty micrograms of harvested
proteins from each lysate were resolved on 10% SDS–PAGE and immunoblotted with
antibodies against Caspase-8 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), cleaved poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) (Cell Signaling) or alpha-tubulin (Sigma); and detected by
chemiluminescence after incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. DR4 and
DR5 total protein levels were determined using rabbit polyclonal antibodies DR4 (CT) and
DR5 (CT), respectively (ProSci, Inc., Poway, CA, USA). Medium was collected from
GBM-NSC co-cultures at 6 h intervals for 48 h and TRAIL secretion was quantified using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described.39
Detection of cell surface DR4 and DR5
GBM cells treated with control (DMSO) or MS-275 (2.5 μM) for 16 h were collected with
EDTA-based reagent Versene (Invitrogen) and stained with PE-conjugated anti-human DR4
(DJR1) or DR5 (DJR2-4) monoclonal antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) in
0.5% BSA/PBS solution at 4 °C for 30 min. Rinses were performed with 0.5% BSA/PBS at

In vivo experiments

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Five different types of in vivo experiments were performed. (1) Atyhmic nude female mice
(3 weeks of age, Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) were implanted with
GBM-FmC cells (5 ×106/mouse; n =3/ group) s.c. and TRAIL was administered
systemically (daily i.p. injections) or as NSC-TRAIL implanted intratumorally. Mice were
imaged for Fluc activity as described.7 (2) Mice were implanted with GBM-FmC cells (5 ×
106/ mouse; n = 3/group) s.c. in a 2:1 mixture of NSCs (GFP or TRAIL-GFP) and mice
were imaged for Fluc activity as described.7 (3) To test the effect of MS-275 on DR4 and
DR5 expression in vivo, mice were implanted with LN229-pDR4-Fl-CMV-RlD or LN229pDR4-Fl-CMV-RlD cells and administered with 10 mg/kg of MS-275 in a mixture of
DMSO/saline i.p. daily (n = 4/group). Mice were imaged for the presence of tumors (Rluc
imaging) using coelenterazine followed by Fluc imaging (for promoter activity) using Dluciferin (Biotium) as described.4 (4) LN229-FmC cells were treated with MS-275 and
implanted in a 2:1 mixture of NSC-GFP or NSC-TRAIL s.c. (n =3/group). Mice were
imaged for Fluc activity as described.36 (5) LN229-FmC cells were implanted s.c. and mice
were administered with 10 mg/kg of MS-275 for 4 days, followed by intratumoral
implantation of NSC-GFP or NSC-TRAIL (2 ×106/tumor, n = 5/group) and mice were
imaged for Fluc activity as described.36 Mice were killed and s.c. tumors were dissected and
processed for RT–PCR analysis and immunohistochemistry. All in vivo procedures were
approved by the Subcommittee on Research Animal Care at Massachusetts General
Hospital.
Quantitative RT–PCR
mRNA was extracted using PureLink RNA Kit (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and cDNA
was synthesized with Superscript VILO cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). SYBR Green and ABI Prism 7000 equipment (Applied Biosystems) were used for
quantitative RT–PCR. The gene of interest value was normalized to the reference gene
(GAPDH) value by taking the difference in their threshold cycle (Ct (ΔCt)) and the
expression levels of each gene were reported as fold of control, such as 2^(ΔCtcontrol −
ΔCtMS-275). The following primer pair sequences were used: DR4: forward, 5′ACCTTCAAGTTTGTCGTCGTC-3′; reverse, 5′-AACTC TCCCAAAGGGCTATGT-3′.
DR5: forward, 5′-AAGACCCTTGTGCTCGTTGT-3′; reverse, 5′AGGTGGACACAATCCCTCTG-3′. GAPDH: forward, 5′-CATGAGAA
GTATGACAACAGCCT-3′; reverse, 5′-AGTCCTTCCACGATACCAAAGT-3′.

Histology
Subcutaneous tumors were dissected and processed for immunohistochemistry as
described.4 Ten micron sections were assessed for GFP and mCherry expression
representing GBM cells and NSCs, respectively. Caspase-3 staining was performed as
described7 using cleaved caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling) and quantified using
photoshop.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by Student’s t-test when comparing two groups. Data were plotted as
mean±s.e.m. and differences were considered significant at P<0.05.

DR5 expression in response to MS-275 (5 μM) treatment for 24 h in LN229 cells. (d, e)
Western blot analysis of DR4 (d) and DR5 (e) expression in response to MS-275 (5 μM)
treatment for 24 h in LN229 cells. (f) Description of the experimental plan. Mice with
TRAIL-resistant LN229-pDR4-Fluc-CMV-RlucDsR2 or LN229-pDR5-Fl-CMV-RlD
tumors were treated i.p. with 10 mg/kg MS-275 or vehicle for 4 days and Fluc and Rluc
activity were measured. (g) Top: representative BLI images of Fluc and Rluc signal.
Bottom: plot showing the quantitation of Fluc/Rluc activity. Data are presented as Fluc/Rluc
ratio as fold of day 0 (n =2 tumors/group). (h) Quantitative RT–PCR analysis of DR4 and
DR5 expression in LN229 tumors extracted from vehicle- or MS-275-treated mice (n =6
tumors/group).

MS-275 sensitizes TRAIL-resistant GBM lines to SC delivered TRAIL in vivo. (a)
Schematic of the rationale for the experimental approach in (b) and (c). (b) Top: description
of the experiment. LN229-FmC cells, treated with MS-275 (5 μM), were admixed with
NSCs (GFP or TRAIL) for implantation. Bottom: representative BLI images and
quantitation of Fluc activity showing the effect of MS-275 and NSC-TRAIL on LN229 cells
in mice on day 4 post implantation (n =3 tumors/group; *denotes P<0.05, t-test). (c) Top:
description of the experiment. Bottom: established LN229-FmC tumors were administered
MS-275 or vehicle i.p. daily for 4 days followed by NSC-TRAIL or control NSC-GFP
implantation intratumorally. Representative BLI images and quantitation of the combined
effect of MS-275 and NSC-TRAIL on TRAIL-resistant LN229 tumor growth (day 10) as
fold of day 0 (n =5 tumors/group; *denotes P<0.05, t-test). (d) Fluorescent images of tumor
sections showing the presence of NSC (green) in LN229-FmC (red) tumors. (e, f) mCherry
fluorescent (red) and cleaved caspase-3 immunofluorescent (blue) images in tumor sections
(e) and quantification of cleaved caspase staining in NSC-GFP, NSC-TRAIL or MS-275
+NSC-TRAIL groups (f).
