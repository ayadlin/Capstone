ABSTRACT
The overexpression of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters makes tumor
cells simultaneously resistant to several cytotoxic drugs. Impairing the energy
metabolism of multidrug resistant (MDR) cells is a promising chemosensitizing
strategy, but many metabolic modifiers are too toxic in vivo. We previously observed
that the aminobisphosphonate zoledronic acid inhibits the activity of hypoxia inducible
factor-1α (HIF-1α), a master regulator of cancer cell metabolism. Free zoledronic
acid, however, reaches low intratumor concentration. We synthesized nanoparticle
formulations of the aminobisphosphonate that allow a higher intratumor delivery
of the drug. We investigated whether they are effective metabolic modifiers and
chemosensitizing agents against human MDR cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.
At not toxic dosage, nanoparticles carrying zoledronic acid chemosensitized
MDR cells to a broad spectrum of cytotoxic drugs, independently of the type of ABC
transporters expressed. The nanoparticles inhibited the isoprenoid synthesis and the
Ras/ERK1/2-driven activation of HIF-1α, decreased the transcription and activity of
glycolytic enzymes, the glucose flux through the glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle,
the electron flux through the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the synthesis of ATP.
So doing, they lowered the ATP-dependent activity of ABC transporters, increasing
the chemotherapy efficacy in vitro and in vivo. These effects were more pronounced
in MDR cells than in chemosensitive ones and were due to the inhibition of farnesyl
pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS), as demonstrated in FPPS-silenced tumors.
Our work proposes nanoparticle formulations of zoledronic acid as the first not
toxic metabolic modifiers, effective against MDR tumors.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

The mevalonate pathway produces cholesterol
and isoprenoids - such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP)
and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate - which activate
small G-proteins like Ras and Rho. The high activity
of the mevalonate pathway induces tumor proliferation,
invasion and aggressiveness, and is correlated with
poor clinical outcome of oncological patients [1, 2].
Hence, inhibitors of the pathway are attractive adjuvant
anti-tumor drugs [3–5].
The overexpression of ATP binding cassette (ABC)
transporters - such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp/ABCB1),
multidrug resistance related proteins (MRPs/ABCCs) and
breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) - limits
the intracellular retention and activity of several cytotoxic
drugs, producing a multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype
in tumor cells [6]. MDR cells have a higher mevalonate
pathway than chemosensitive ones [7, 8]. Since the
activity of ABC transporters is increased by the high
content of cholesterol in the plasma membrane [7–9], the
inhibition of mevalonate pathway has efficiently overcome
the MDR phenotype in vitro [7–13].
To achieve the maximal efficacy, ABC transporters
have also a huge need of ATP [6]. ATP depleting agents
exert higher cytotoxicity against MDR cells than against
chemosensitive ones, inducing a phenomenon known
as “collateral sensitivity” [14, 15]. Although ATP
depleting agents are very effective in vitro, they are too
toxic in vivo [16].
Zoledronic acid (ZA), a clinically used
aminobisphosphonate that inhibits the FPP synthase
(FPPS) step in the mevalonate pathway [17], reduces the
activity and expression of Pgp in MDR cells by decreasing
the amount of cholesterol in plasma membrane and
inhibiting the Pgp transcription mediated by the hypoxia
inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) [8]. Of note, HIF-1α also
increases the energy metabolism and ATP synthesis in
cancer cells [18].
The major drawback of using ZA at clinically
achievable concentrations is its fast uptake by bone
tissue that limits the amount of the drug reaching the
tumor [19]. In previous studies we demonstrated that
ZA has a negligible effect on different tumors in vivo, in
consequence of its low intratumor accumulation. The use
of nanocarriers such as nanoparticles (NPs) or liposomes
made ZA a powerful anticancer agent by improving its
intratumor delivery [20–24]. The use of nanovectors have
enhanced the anti-proliferative activity of ZA in a wide
spectrum of chemosensitive tumors [20–23], but it is not
known whether NPs carrying ZA (here termed NZ) are
also effective against MDR tumors.
In this work we demonstrated that NZ is a strong
chemosensitizing agent, owing to its peculiar effects on
the energy metabolism of MDR tumors.

NZ inhibits the mevalonate pathway/Ras/
ERK1/2/HIF-1α/Pgp axis and sensitizes
MDR cells to a broad spectrum of
chemotherapeutic agents

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We investigated the effects of ZA and NZ in non-small
cell lung cancer A549 cells and in the chemoresistant
counterpart A549/MDR cells, which had higher IC50
values towards different cytotoxic drugs (Table 1)
and higher expression of different ABC transporters
(Supplementary Figure 1). The NZ particles used in this
study had a mean diameter of about 150 nm with a narrow
size distribution (polydispersity index – P.I. – lower than
0.2). A deep characterization of these particles have been
described in [20]. The IC50 of ZA, NZ and self-assembling
nanoparticles without ZA (blank NPs) in A549 and A549/
MDR cells are provided in the Table 2: on the basis of
these values, in all the experiments we used ZA, NZ and
blank NPs at the not toxic concentration of 1 μM.
In A549/MDR cells NZ lowered the IC50 of different
cytotoxic drugs, unrelated for structure, mechanism of
action and efflux through specific ABC transporters,
more than ZA (Table 1). Similar results were obtained
in chemosensitive HT29 cells and in their resistant
counterpart HT29/MDR cells (Supplementary Table 1).
NZ and – at a lesser extent ZA – reduced the expression
of Pgp, but did not change the levels of the other ABC
transporters (Supplementary Figure 2).
We next analyzed if NZ reduced the mevalonate
pathway activity, which favors the MDR phenotype
and is inhibited by ZA [8]. NZ decreased the synthesis
of cholesterol and FPP more than ZA, after 24 and 48
h; its effect was stronger in A549/MDR cells, which
had a basally higher activity than A549 cells (Figure
1a–1b). In parallel, NZ lowered the activity of Ras and
Ras-downstream effectors ERK1/2 (Figure 1c). HIF-1α,
which was constitutively phosphorylated (Figure 1c) and
bound to its DNA target sequence (Figure 1d) in A549/
MDR cells, is a substrate of ERK [25]. NZ reduced the
HIF-1α amount, phosphorylation and DNA binding
(Figure 1c–1d), and lowered the transcription of the HIF1α-target gene Pgp (Figure 1e) in MDR cells.
We next looked for potential mechanisms explaining
the chemosensitizing effects of NZ on drugs that are not
substrates of Pgp.

By reducing HIF-1α activity, NZ decreases the
glycolytic flux and the ATP levels in MDR cells
Compared to A549 cells, A549/MDR cells
had higher expression of the HIF-1α-target genes
glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), hexokinase (HK),

NZ inhibits the mitochondrial metabolism and
increases the reactive oxygen species production
in MDR cells

decreased the Vmax in A549/MDR cells (Figure 5a).
Moreover NZ increased the doxorubicin Km, suggesting
that it reduced the affinity of the drug for the transporters.
The intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin, carboplatin
(a substrate of MRP1, MRP2, MRP4), gemcitabine
(a substrate of MRP5) and mitoxantrone (a substrate of
BCRP, Pgp, MRP1) were all significantly increased by NZ
in A549/MDR cells (Figure 5b–5e).

The synthesis of ubiquinone, whose isoprenoid tail
is a side product of the mevalonate pathway, was higher
in A549/MDR cells than in A549 cells (Figure 4a). The
higher amount of ubiquinone was paralleled by the higher
activity of the respiratory chain (Figure 4b) and by the
higher level of mitochondrial ATP (Figure 4c). NZ and ZA
reduced the electron flux and the ATP levels proportionally
to their ability to decrease ubiquinone (Figure 4a–4c).
NZ also increased the reactive oxygen species
(ROS) in A549 and A549/MDR cells (Figure 4d–4e).

The chemosensitizing effect of NZ is due to the
inhibition of FPPS
The chemosensitizing properties of NZ were not
due to the use of the NPs scaffold: indeed blank NPs
did not reduce the activity of mevalonate pathway, the
activation of HIF-1α, the levels of ATP, the transcription
of Pgp and the efflux of doxorubicin in A549/MDR cells
(Supplementary Figure 4a–4e).
To investigate whether the properties of NZ were
due to the inhibition of the ZA-target enzyme FPPS, we
produced a A549/MDR subclone inducibly knocked-down
for FPPS (Figure 6a). As expected, FPPS-silenced A549/
MDR cells had extremely low levels of cholesterol, FPP
and ubiquinone (Supplementary Figure 5a–5c). Moreover,
they had lower activity of Ras and ERK1/2 (Figure 6b),
lower phosphorylation (Figure 6b) and DNA binding of

NZ reduces the efflux activity of ABC
transporters and increases the intracellular drug
retention in MDR cells
Since doxorubicin is a substrate of Pgp, MRP1,
MRP2, MRP3 and BCRP [6], we measured its efflux
kinetics as a sensitive index of the activity of these
transporters. As expected, A549/MDR cells had a higher
Vmax of doxorubicin efflux than A549 cells (Figure 5a).
Neither ZA nor NZ changed the Vmax in A549 cells
(Figure 5a). By contrast, NZ and – at lesser extent – ZA

the transcription of Pgp [8], NZ reversed the resistance
towards Pgp substrates.
The chemosensitization towards cytotoxic agents
that are not substrates of Pgp was due to the effects on the
energy metabolism of MDR cells.
Many HIF-1α-target genes involved in the glycolytic
flux were up-regulated in MDR cells if compared with
chemosensitive ones. This condition, which is compatible
with the Warburg effect observed in many solid tumors,
increased the glucose flux through the glycolysis and
TCA cycle, and the intracellular levels of ATP. Also
the electron flux through the mitochondrial respiratory
chain and the mitochondrial synthesis of ATP were
increased in MDR cells. Such increase can be explained
by the higher supply of reducing equivalents through the
accelerated TCA cycle and/or by the higher levels of the
electron shuttle ubiquinone, which is a side product of the
mevalonate pathway. Chemoresistant cells often activate
both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to ensure
an adequate supply of ATP [27], which is constantly

hydrolyzed by ABC transporters. This observation
is in keeping with the metabolic profile of our MDR
cells, which had higher activity of both anaerobic and
aerobic energy pathways and higher expression of ABC
transporters than chemosensitive cells.
On the other hand, MDR cells show a paradoxical
hypersensitivity - the so called “collateral sensitivity” - to
agents lowering ATP or inducing oxidative stress [14, 15].
Our work suggests that NZ is a strong inducer of
collateral sensitivity: it reduced glucose anaerobic and
aerobic metabolism, increased ROS production and
lowered intracellular ATP, by decreasing the mevalonate
pathway/Ras/ERKs/HIF-1α axis and the supply of
ubiquinone to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. As a
consequence, NZ reduced the ATP-dependent activity of
ABC transporters in MDR cells, increased the intracellular
retention and cytotoxicity of multiple chemotherapeutic
agents in vitro and in vivo.
These results are in line with previous data showing
that agents depleting cellular ATP [28] or lowering glucose

uptake and oxidative phosphorylation [29] overcome
chemoresistance. Differently from other ATP depleting
agents, which are highly toxic [16], NZ chemosensitized
MDR cells at a concentration (1 μM) not toxic in our
animal models and compatible with the concentration of
ZA found in patients [30, 31].
Interestingly, NZ was significantly more effective
in MDR cells than in chemosensitive ones. By targeting
the mevalonate pathway and the activity of HIF-1α,
which are basally more active in chemoresistant cells,
NZ exploited two metabolic features that are crucial to
maintain the MDR phenotype. The linkage between the
inhibition of the mevalonate pathway and the resulting
chemosensitizing effects was demonstrated by FPPSsilenced cells, which reproduced the same phenotype of
NZ-treated MDR cells.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Chemoresistant cells often activate multiple
survival pathways in response to stress conditions,
such as JAK/STAT3 axis, Akt/mTOR axis, peroxisome
proliferator activated receptor gamma-dependent
pathways and cyclooxygenase 2-dependent pathways:
these redundant pro-survival pathways promote cell
proliferation and inhibit apoptosis, contributing to
drug resistance [32–34]. We recently observed that
JAK/STAT3 axis is constitutively activated in MDR
cells [35] and that ZA inhibits it by reducing the Ras/
ERK1/2 activity [13]. Moreover, it has been reported
that ZA effects can be mediated by peroxisome
proliferator activated receptor gamma [36] and
cyclooxygenase 2 [37] activity. We cannot exclude that
ZA and NZ chemosensitized A549/MDR cells also by
targeting some of these pathways.

The use of drugs encapsulated within liposomes has
been proposed as an effective strategy to overcome the
drug resistance mediated by ABC transporters [38], for
the different kinetics of drug release [39, 40], the different
drug intracellular distribution [40, 41], the reduction of
Pgp expression and activity [41–43], the changes in the
lipid environment where Pgp works [44, 45].
We excluded that the chemosensitizing effect of
NZ was due to the liposomal envelope, because selfassembling NPs without ZA did not reverse the MDR
phenotype. On the other hand, it is known that NZ
induces greater anti-proliferative effects than free ZA on
tumor cells, because the use of NPs produced a higher
intratumor uptake of the aminobisphosphonate [19–24].
Also in this study, the greater efficacy of NZ over free
ZA can be explained by the higher uptake of ZA when
administered as NZ.

Our work unveils that NPs encapsulating ZA reverse
the MDR phenotype by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway
and the HIF-1α-dependent signaling, two events that
impair the energy metabolism and the activity of ABC
transporters (Figure 8). These observations may pave the
way to the pre-clinical use of NZ, in combination with
other cytotoxic drugs, as the first not toxic metabolic
modifier, effective against MDR tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
Investigation has been conducted in accordance
with the ethical standards, according to the Declaration
of Helsinki, national and international guidelines, and has
been approved by the authors’ institutional review board.

Figure 8: Metabolic basis of the chemosensitizing effects of NZ in MDR cells. Self-assembling nanoparticles encapsulating

zoledronic acid (NZ) inhibit the farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) step in the mevalonate (Mev) pathway. So doing, NZ reduces
the Ras/ERK1/2/HIF-1α-mediated transcription of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), the transcription of glycolytic genes, the synthesis of ubiquinone
(UQ) and the mitochondrial electron flux, thus limiting the supply of ATP for Pgp, multidrug resistance related proteins (MRPs) and breast
cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Overall these events increase the intracellular retention and toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs (d).

spectroscopy (N5, Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL).
Each sample was diluted in deionizer/filtered water
and analyzed with detector at 90° angle. P.I. was used
as measure of the particle size distribution. For each
batch, the mean diameter and size distribution were the
mean of three measures. For each formulation, the mean
diameter and P.I. were calculated as the mean of three
different batches. The zeta potential (ζ) of the NPs surface
was measured in water by means of a Zetasizer Nano Z
(Malvern, UK). Data of ζ were collected as the average of
20 measurements.

Fetal bovine serum and culture medium were
from Invitrogen Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA).
Plasticware for cell cultures was from Falcon (Becton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Dihydroethidium (DHE),
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and H2O2 were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy). ZA was a gift from Novartis
(Basel, Switzerland). Electrophoresis reagents were
obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA).
The protein content of cell monolayers and lysates was
assessed with the BCA kit from Sigma-Aldrich. Unless
otherwise specified, all the other reagents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich.

Encapsulation efficiency of ZA
ZA dosage was carried out as previously
reported [20]. 1 ml of NPs dispersion was ultra-centrifuged
(Optima Max E, Beckman Coulter) at 80,000 x g at 4°C
for 40 min. Supernatants were carefully removed and ZA
concentration was determined by high pressure liquid
chromatography. The ZA encapsulation efficiency into
CaPZNPs was calculated as [(TSZA – ASZA)/TSZA] × 100,
where TSZA is the theoretical ZA in the supernatant and
ASZA is the actual ZA concentration in the supernatant. For
each formulation, the results are the mean of measures on
three different batches.

Preparation and characterization of NZ
Self-assembling NPs encapsulating ZA were
prepared as previously reported [20]. Briefly, an
aqueous solution of 18 mM CaCl2 was added, dropwise
and under magnetic stirring, to an aqueous solution of
10.8 mM Na2HPO4. The resulting suspension (termed
CaPNPs) was filtered through a 0.22 μm polycarbonate
filter (MF-Millipore, Microglass Heim, Italy) and
stored at 4°C before use. ZA was then complexed with
CaPNPs (to obtain CaPZNPs), at a volume ratio of
50:1, with a final ZA concentration of 50 mg/ml.
Cationic liposomes (N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,Ntrimethylammonium chloride/cholesterol/1,2-distearoyl-snglycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[amino(polyethylene
glycol)-2000] at a ratio of 1:1:0.5) were prepared by
hydration of a thin lipid film followed by extrusion. The
lipid mixture dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1
v/v) was added to a 50 ml round-bottom flask and the
solvent was removed under reduced pressure by a rotary
evaporator (Laborota 4010 digital, Heidolph, Schwabach,
Germany) in nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting lipid
film was hydrated with 1 ml of 0.22 μm-filtered distilled
water and the resulting suspension was gently mixed
in the presence of glass beads followed by incubation
at room temperature for 2 h. The liposome suspension
was then extruded using a thermobarrel extruder system
(Northern Lipids Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada) passing
repeatedly the suspension under nitrogen atmosphere
through polycarbonate membranes with decreasing pore
sizes from 400 to 100 nm (Nucleopore Track Membrane
25 mm, Whatman, Brentford, UK). The liposomes were
stored at 4°C. Each formulation was prepared in triplicate.
Finally, equal volumes of suspensions of the liposomes
and CaPZNPs, respectively, were mixed in a glass tube
and the resulting dispersion was maintained at room
temperature for 10 min. NPs without ZA (blank NPs) were
also prepared similarly, starting from CaPNPs and cationic
liposomes. Each formulation was prepared in triplicate.
The mean diameter of stealth liposomes and
CaPZNPs were determined at 20°C by photon correlation

Cells
Human chemosensitive non-small cell lung
cancer A549 cells were cultured in HAM’s F12 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1%
penicillin-streptomycin and 1% L-glutamine, and were
maintained in a humidified atmosphere at 37°C and
5% CO2. A549/MDR cells were generated by culturing
parental A549 cells in medium containing increasing
concentrations of doxorubicin for 30 passages and then
maintaining cells at a final concentration of 100 nM
doxorubicin. HT29 and HT29/MDR cells have been
already described [8, 46].

Cytotoxicity assay
Cell viability was measured by the neutral red
staining method as previously reported [46]. The
absorbance of untreated cells was considered as 100%
viability; the results were expressed as percentage of
viable cells versus untreated cells. IC50 was considered the
concentration of each drug that reduces to 50% the cell
viability versus untreated cells.

Mevalonate pathway activity
Cells were labelled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]-acetate
(3600 mCi/mmol; Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ).

Hilden, Germany). qRT-PCR was carried out with IQ™
SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Primers
sequence is listed in the Supplementary Table 3. The
relative quantitation of each sample was performed using
the Gene Expression Quantitation software (Bio-Rad
Laboratories).

Ras activation assay
The Ras GTP-bound fraction, taken as an index of
active Ras, was measured using a pull-down assay with
the Raf-1-GST fusion protein, agarose beads-conjugates
(Millipore, Billerica, MA). The immunoprecipitated
samples were probed with an anti-Ras (Millipore)
antibody.

Glucose uptake, enzymatic assays and TCA cycle
activity
The uptake of glucose was measured as described
earlier [48] and expressed as pmol 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose/mg cell proteins. PFK1 assay was performed
according to [49]. The activities of GAPDH, enolase,
LDH were measured as reported in [50]. The activity of
PK was detected with the Enzymatic Assay of Pyruvate
Kinase kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Results were expressed as
nmol NAD+/min/mg cell proteins (for PFK1, enolase, PK,
LDH) or nmol NADH/min/mg cell proteins (for GAPDH).
The glucose flux through glycolysis and TCA cycle was
measured as described in [51] and expressed as pmol
CO2/h/mg cell proteins.

Western blot
Cells were rinsed in lysis buffer (125 mM TrisHCl, 750 mM NaCl, 1% v/v NP40, 10% v/v glycerol,
50 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaF, 1 mM NaVO4,
10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml
aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5),
sonicated and centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C.
20 μg cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting and
probed with the following antibodies: phospho-(Thr202/
Tyr204, Thr185/Tyr187)-ERK1/2 (Millipore); ERK1/2
(Millipore); HIF-1α (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA);
FPPS (Abcam, Cambridge, UK); Pgp/ABCB1 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); MRP1/
ABCC1 (Abcam); MRP2/ABCC2 (Abcam); MRP3/
ABCC3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); MRP4/ABCC4
(Abcam); MRP5/ABCC5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology
Inc.); BCRP/ABCG2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.);
β-tubulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), followed by
the secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (BioRad Laboratories). Proteins were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). To
assess HIF-1α phosphorylation, the whole cell lysate
was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-HIF-1α
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), then resolved
by SDS-PAGE and probed with a biotin-conjugated antiphosphoserine antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by
polymeric streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase-conjugates
(Sigma-Aldrich).

ATP measurement
The ATP level in whole cells and mitochondria
extracts was measured with the ATP Bioluminescent
Assay Kit (FL-AA, Sigma-Aldrich). ATP was quantified
as arbitrary light units and converted into nmol ATP/mg
cell or mitochondrial proteins, according to the calibration
curve previously set.

Respiratory chain activity
Mitochondria were extracted as described
earlier [52]. A 50 μl aliquot was sonicated and used for the
measurement of protein content or Western blotting; the
remaining part was stored at −80°C until use. To confirm
the presence of mitochondrial proteins in the extracts,
10 μg of each sonicated sample was subjected to SDSPAGE and probed with an anti-porin antibody (Abcam;
data not shown). The electron flux from Complex I to
Complex III was measured on 10 μg of not sonicated
mitochondrial extracts, as reported in [52]. Each sample
was incubated in the absence or presence of the Complex
I inhibitor rotenone (50 μM), to measure the ubiquinoneindependent and the ubiquinone-dependent electron flux,
respectively. The reaction was followed for 5 min, using
a Packard EL340 microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments,
Winooski, VT). Results were expressed as nmol reduced
cytochrome c/min/mg mitochondrial proteins.

HIF-1α activity
Nuclear proteins were extracted using the Nuclear
Extract Kit (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium).
The activity of HIF-1 was assessed with the TransAM™
HIF-1 Transcription Factor Assay Kit (Active Motif)
on 10  μg nuclear proteins. Data were expressed as U
absorbance/mg nuclear proteins.

of 605 nm. 2 × 105 cells were incubated for 1 h with
20 ng/ml DHE, trypsinized, washed twice with PBS and
re-suspended in 500 μl of PBS. The dye accumulation was
analyzed by a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson), using the FL2-channel (band pass filter:
585 nm). For each sample, 2 × 104 events were acquired.
H2O2, chosen as a compound that increases ROS in both
chemosensitive and MDR cells; doxorubicin, chosen as a
compound that increases ROS in chemosensitive but not
in MDR cells; NAC, chosen as an antioxidant agent, were
included as internal controls in each experiment.

BME (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), were implanted
subcutaneously in 6 weeks-old female nude BALB/c
mice, housed under 12 h light/dark cycle, with food and
drinking provided ad libitum. When the tumors reached
the volume of 100 mm3, the animals were randomized
into these groups: control group (treated with 20 μl saline
solution i.v. on days 2, 8, 14); NZ group (treated with
20 μg/mouse NZ i.v. on days 2, 8, 14); doxorubicin group
(treated with 4 mg/kg doxorubicin i.v. on days 3, 9, 15);
NZ + doxorubicin group (treated with 20 μg/mouse NZ
on days 2, 8, 14 followed by 4 mg/kg doxorubicin on days
3, 9, 15); carboplatin group (treated with 50 mg/kg
carboplatin i.v. on days 3, 9, 15); NZ + carboplatin group
(treated with 20 μg/mouse NZ on days 2, 8, 14 followed
by 50 mg/kg carboplatin on days 3, 9, 15). In a second
experimental set, A549/MDR cells inducibly silenced
for FPPS were implanted and mice were treated with
doxorubicin or carboplatin as reported above. FPPS
silencing was induced by adding doxycycline (1 mg/ml)
in the drinking water. Tumor growth was measured by
caliper and was calculated according to the equation:
(L × W2)/2, where L = tumor length and W = tumor width.
Mice were euthanized at day 21. The hematochemical
parameters LDH, aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase
(AP), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), creatinine were
measured on 0.5 ml of blood collected immediately after
mice sacrifice, using commercially available kits from
Beckman Coulter Inc. (Brea, CA). The experimental
procedures were approved by the Bioethics Committee
(“Comitato Etico di Ateneo”) of the University of Torino,
Italy.

Doxorubicin efflux rate
The kinetic parameters of doxorubicin efflux were
calculated as previously reported [43]. Values were fitted
to Michaelis-Menten equation to calculate Vmax and
Km, using the Enzfitter software (Biosoft Corporation,
Cambridge, United Kingdom).

Intracellular drug content
Cells were incubated for 3 h with 5 μM doxorubicin,
1 μCi/ml [14C]-carboplatin (20 Ci/mmol; Amersham
Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ), 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]-gemcitabine
(10 Ci/mmol; Moravek Biochemicals and Radiochemicals,
Brea, CA), 10 μM mitoxantrone. Samples were washed
twice in PBS, detached with trypsin, centrifuged at
1,300 x g for 2 min and sonicated. The amount of [14C]carboplatin and [3H]-gemcitabine was measured using a
Tri-Carb Liquid Scintillation Analyzer (PerkinElmer).
Radioactivity was converted in nmol/mg cell proteins
for [14C]-carboplatin or pmol/mg cell proteins for [3H]gemcitabine, using a calibration curve previously prepared.
The amount of doxorubicin and mitoxantrone was
measured fluorimetrically, using a LS-5 spectrofluorimeter
(PerkinElmer). Excitation and emission wavelengths were:
475 nm and 553 nm (doxorubicin); 607 nm and 684 nm
(mitoxantrone). Fluorescence was converted in nmol/mg
cell proteins, using a calibration curve previously set.

Statistical analysis
All data in text and figures are provided as means
± SD. The results were analyzed by a one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s test. p < 0.05 was
considered significant.
