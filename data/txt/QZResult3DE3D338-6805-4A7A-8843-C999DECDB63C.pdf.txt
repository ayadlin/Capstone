Abstract

Author Manuscript

The Raf/MEK/ERK cascade is a therapeutic target in human cancers with deregulated Ras
signaling, which includes tumours that have inactivated the Nf1 tumour suppressor1. Nf1 encodes
neurofibromin, a GTPase activating protein that terminates Ras signalling by stimulating
hydrolysis of Ras•GTP. We compared the effects of inhibitors of MEK in a myeloproliferative
disorder (MPD) initiated by inactivating Nf1 in mouse bone marrow and in acute myeloid
leukaemias (AMLs) in which cooperating mutations were induced by retroviral insertional
mutagenesis. Here we show that MEK inhibitors are ineffective in MPD, but induce objective
regression of many Nf1-deficient AMLs. Drug resistance developed due to outgrowth of AML

clones that were present before treatment. We cloned clone-specific retroviral integrations to
identify candidate resistance genes including Rasgrp1, Rasgrp4, and Mapk14, which encodes
p38α. Functional analysis implicated increased RasGRP1 levels and reduced p38 kinase activity in
resistance to MEK inhibitors. This approach represents a robust strategy for identifying genes and
pathways that modulate how primary cancer cells respond to targeted therapeutics and for probing
mechanisms of de novo and acquired resistance.

Aberrant Ras signalling contributes to the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies and can
result from acquired RAS mutations or from alternative genetic mechanisms that include
FLT3 internal tandem duplications, the BCR-ABL fusion, PTPN11 mutations, and NF1
inactivation (reviewed in2). Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) have a 200–500
fold excess incidence of juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), an aggressive MPD
characterized by leukocytosis, splenomegaly, and tissue infiltration (reviewed in3). The bone
marrows of affected patients frequently show loss of the normal parental NF1 allele and
elevated extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activity4. Biallelic inactivation of murine
Nf1 causes a MPD in Mx1-Cre, Nf1flox/flox mice that closely models JMML5.
We injected the MOL4070LTR retrovirus6 into Mx1-Cre, Nf1flox/flox pups to identify genes
and pathways that might cooperate with Nf1 inactivation to induce progression of MPD to
AML2. These mice developed acute leukaemia sooner and at a higher rate than control Mx1Cre-negative littermates that retain normal Nf1 function, (Fig. 1a). Nf1-deficient AMLs are
highly aggressive (Figs. 1b, 1c); show variable expression of myeloid surface markers; are
transplantable into sublethally irradiated recipients; and form cytokine-dependent blast
colonies in methylcellulose cultures.

The MEK inhibitor CI-10407 reduced the growth of myeloid progenitor colonies from the
bone marrows of Mx1-Cre, Nf1flox/flox mice with MPD and WT controls to a similar extent
(Fig. 1d). By contrast, blast colony growth from many Nf1-deficient AMLs was exquisitely
sensitive with abrogation of colony growth at 10–100 fold lower drug concentrations (Fig.
1d). These in vitro data suggested that cooperating mutations render Nf1 mutant AMLs more
dependent on Raf/ERK/MEK signalling. To pursue this question, we first determined the
maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of CI-1040 to be 100 mg/kg twice daily in WT mice,
collected bone marrow at defined time points after a single drug dose, and showed that
CI-1040 treatment transiently reduced the ability of graunlocyte-macrophage colony
stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to increase phosphorylated ERK (pERK) levels
(Supplementary Fig. 1a). We then treated control or Mx1-Cre, Nf1flox/flox mice with MPD
for 28 days (n=5 per group). Consistent with the in vitro data, CI-1040 had no beneficial
therapeutic index in mice with MPD (Supplementary Figs. 1b, 1c, and data not shown).
Biochemical analysis of bone marrow obtained 2–8 hours after the 56th and final dose of
CI-1040 revealed reduced ERK phosphorylation that was similar to the responses of WT
mice that received a single drug dose (Supplementary Figs. 1a, 1d).
To investigate the unexpected in vitro sensitivity of Nf1 mutant AMLs to CI-1040, we
transplanted 4 independent leukaemias into 23 recipients. Mice with AML blasts in the
peripheral blood were assigned to treatment with either vehicle (n = 11) or CI-1040 (n = 12)
at the same dose and schedule that was ineffective in the MPD. CI-1040 treatment induced

rapid and extensive reductions in blood leukocyte counts (Fig. 2a) with clearance of blasts
and reappearance of normal neutrophils (data not shown). Survival was increased greater
than three-fold (Fig. 2b). However, recipients of Mx1-Cre, Nf1flox/flox AMLs invariably died
with recurrent leukaemia despite ongoing treatment (Fig. 2b). These relapsed AMLs had
similar morphologic and immunophenotypic features as the parental leukaemias, but
demonstrated in vitro resistance to MEK inhibitors and were refractory to treatment in
secondary recipients (Fig. 2c and data not shown). Sensitive AMLs showed a greater
reduction in 5’-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation following CI-1040 exposure than either
WT or resistant leukaemia cells (Supplementary Fig. 2). We also exposed pairs of sensitive
and resistant AMLs to CI-1040 in vitro to ask if resistance is associated with reactivation of
MEK. Importantly, ERK phosphorylation in response to GM-CSF was inhibited at the same
concentration of CI-1040 (Figs. 2d, 2e).

PD0325901 is a MEK inhibitor with more favourable pharmacologic characteristics than
CI-10408. We defined a MTD of 12.5 mg/kg/day for PD0325901, and found that doses > 5
mg/kg/day reduced ERK activation in response to GM-CSF for 24 hours (Supplementary
Fig. 3a). To ask if prolonging the duration of MEK inhibition affects drug response and
resistance in vivo, we administered PD0325901 to mice that were transplanted with two
AMLs from the CI-1040 trial (AMLs #6554 and #6537). Recipients that received
PD0325901 demonstrated the same pattern of response, relapse, and overall survival
(Supplementary Fig. 3b). We also tested two other Nf1-deficient AMLs for response to
PD0325901. AML #7723 was less sensitive to MEK inhibition in methylcellulose cultures
and administering PD0325901 to recipient mice neither prolonged survival nor changed the
IC50 for blast colony formation (Supplementary Fig. 4). AML #7710 showed an in vitro
response to PD0325901 that was similar to sensitive leukaemias; however, in vivo treatment
did not prolong survival or select for clones with altered drug responsiveness
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Together, these studies define a heterogeneous response of Nf1deficient AMLs to MEK inhibition.

Digesting DNA from AML #6554 with restriction enzymes and Southern blot analysis with
a MOL4070LTR-specific probe revealed clonal evolution of the resistant leukemia (Figs.
3a). To identify candidate genes that might influence response to CI-1040, we exploited a
shotgun cloning strategy9 to characterize MOL4070LTR integrations. Sensitive parental
AML #6554 and resistant leukaemias from CI-1040 and PD0325901-treated recipient mice
shared some common integrations as well as unique insertions (Fig. 3a and Supplementary
Table 1). Importantly, resistant leukaemias from independent recipients that were treated
with CI-1040 or PD0325901 invariably showed the same integration patterns (Fig. 3a and
Supplementary Table 1). These data and the rapid emergence of resistance infer that
resistant subclones that are present within the initial AML are selected in vivo during MEK
inhibitor treatment.
The patterns of MOL4070LTR integrations in sensitive and resistant AML #6554 suggested
that Rasgrp genes might contribute to drug resistance (Supplementary Table 1). We
developed quantitative real time PCR (RT-PCR) assays to correlate Rasgrp1 insertion copy
number and RNA expression in AML #6554 with the integration data shown in
Supplementary Table 1. Whereas analysis of sensitive AML #6554 from 8 independent

recipients revealed only low levels of a unique integration junction fragment, four
independent PD0325901 –resistant leukaemias demonstrated 1,000 fold (range 500–1,500
fold) increases in DNA copy number. Similarly, Rasgrp1 messenger RNA levels were
increased an average of 10 fold (range 6.5–19 fold) in resistant versus sensitive leukaemias
(Fig. 3b). RasGRP proteins stimulate guanine nucleotide exchange on Ras, which increases
Ras•GTP levels (reviewed in10). We reasoned that increased Rasgrp1 expression might
result in elevated Ras•GTP levels in resistant AML #6554. Indeed, whereas basal Ras•GTP
levels were low in the parental leukaemia and returned to baseline 60 minutes after exposure
to GM-CSF, we observed constitutive Ras activation in the resistant AML (Fig. 3c).
Resistant AML #6554 also formed cytokine-independent blast colonies in methylcellulose
(Fig 3d). This observation is consistent with biochemical and computational analyses in
lymphocytes, which predict that Ras signalling becomes independent of receptor input when
RasGRP levels are elevated11. To further assess the functional importance of Rasgrp1 overexpression in resistant AML #6554, we infected the sensitive and resistant leukaemias with
a lentiviral vector encoding both a short hairpin RNA that efficiently reduces RasGRP1
protein (Supplementary Fig. 5) and a green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker. GFP-positive
cells were isolated by sorting and plated in methylcellulose medium containing GM-CSF
and a range of PD0325901 concentrations. Neither the Rasgrp1 virus nor a control virus
altered the sensitivity of parental AML blast colony forming cells to the MEK inhibitor (Fig.
3e). By contrast, infecting resistant AML #6554 with the Rasgrp1 shRNA lentivirus restored
the sensitivity of these cells to PD0325901, with a shift of the IC50 into the same range as in
the sensitive parental AML (Fig. 3e).

Multiple recipients that were transplanted with AML #6537 relapsed with the same resistant
clone after treatment with either CI-1040 or PD0325901 (Fig. 4a). This resistant leukaemia
showed a distinct retroviral integration pattern, including one within Mapk14, which
encodes p38α (Supplementary Table 2). RT-PCR of proviral/host DNA junctions confirmed
that the inserted allele copy number is increased 1,000 fold (range 1,000–10,000 fold) in the
resistant AML. The proviral insertion is in the anti-sense orientation and Southern blot
analysis supports inactivation of one Mapk14 allele (Fig. 4a, 4b). Consistent with this
prediction, basal p38 kinase activity is reduced in resistant AML #6537 (Fig. 4c). To further
investigate if decreased p38α activity modulates resistance to MEK inhibitors in primary
leukaemia cells, we enumerated blast colonies from AML #6537 in the presence of either
CI-1040, SB202190 (a specific inhibitor of p38α)12 or both drugs. SB202190 strongly
antagonized the inhibitory effects of CI-1040 on the sensitive leukaemia, but had minimal
effects on the resistant AML (Fig. 4d).

Cooperating mutations that induce progression of MPD to AML render these more
aggressive leukaemias highly dependent upon MEK for proliferation and survival. The
transient remisisons induced by imatinib in advanced (“blast crisis”) CML13 are remarkably
similar to the responses of Mx1-Cre, Nf1flox/flox AMLs to MEK inhibition. Relapse of blast
crisis CML and of Nf1 mutant murine leukaemias is due to outgrowth of a minor population
of drug-resistant cells that is present before treatment with targeted agents14. Similarly,
“backtracking” experiments in acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL) showed that the
dominant clone at relapse is frequently detectable before treatment15. Relapsed ALL clones

differ from the predominant clone at diagnosis by a few genetic changes16. Diverse
mutations of genes involved in lymphoid developmental programs, cell cycle control, and
DNA damage responses are enriched in drug resistant clones, while alterations in drug
import, export, or metabolism are relatively uncommon16. Understanding how preexisting
drug-resistant clones underlie cancer relapse has fundamental implications for developing
better therapeutic strategies.

As MEK is one component of a complex network of Ras effectors, it is possible to envision
multiple mechanisms of acquired resistance. Our data support this idea. A provocative
implication of our studies of AML #6554 showing that Rasgrp1 over-expression modulates
the response to MEK inhibitors is that globally increasing Ras•GTP levels can overcome the
effects of inhibiting a major Ras effector in some cancers. We implicated reduced p38
kinase activity as an alternative mechanism of MEK resistance in AML #6537. Interestingly,
cancer cell lines that undergo apoptosis in response to oncoprotein inhibition show a rapid
decrease in pERK followed by an increase in phosphorylated p38 levels17. As Nf1-deficient
AMLs have elevated basal p38 kinase activity, our studies suggest that inhibiting oncogenic
Raf/MEK/ERK signalling results in unopposed p38 kinase activity, which contributes to cell
death. This general idea is consistent with the observation that p38 inhibitors induce
imatinib resistance in cultured CML cells17,18. The AMLs that we have characterized to date
showed diverse retroviral integrations (Supplementary Tables 1–3), and comprehensive
genetic and preclinical analyses are required to uncover the full spectrum of mutations
associated with drug resistance. Despite this limitation, a broad implication of our data is
that cell lineage, the nature of cooperating mutations, and the order in which they are
acquired in specific cancers will modulate the efficacy of targeted inhibitors of Ras effector
pathways. Insertional mutagenesis in genetically accurate mouse cancer models is a
powerful tool for dissecting the molecular basis of cellular responses to oncogenic stress and
for uncovering genes that contribute to drug sensitivity and resistance.

cells in the peripheral blood were randomly assigned to receive either CI-1040/PD0325901
or control vehicle. Mice were weighed weekly to adjust the drug dose, observed daily, and
killed when they became moribund or on the 28th day of treatment.
Myeloid Progenitor Growth and Pharmacodynamic Studies
CFU-GM and blast colonies were grown in methylcellulose medium M3231 (Stem Cell

AML #6554 demonstrates substantial cytokine-independent blast colony growth (n=5),
which is not seen in the sensitive leukaemia (n=6) (p=0.0350, t-test). e, Resistant AML
#6554 that is infected with a RasGRP1 shRNA (open circles dotted line, n=7) demonstrates
an IC50=0.03 µM (95% CI 0.02–0.03 µM), which is significantly lower than the IC50 of
resistant cells infected with the control vector (IC50=0.06 µM, 95% CI 0.05–0.07 µM; open
circles, solid, n=7). The IC50 of parental sensitive AML infected with shRNA vector to
RasGRP1 (IC50=0.02 µM, 95% CI 0.017–0.024 µM; closed squares, dotted line, n=3) or
control vector (IC50=0.02 µM, 95% CI 0.017–0.028 µM; closed squares, solid line n=3) are
not statistically significantly different than Resistant AML #6554 infected with RasGRP1
shRNA. Error bars represent s.e.m. in d and e.

a, Southern blot analysis of MOL4070LTR integrations of AML #6537 following treatment
with vehicle (V), CI-1040 (CI) or PD0325901 (PD). Asterisks denote restriction fragments
that are present in all the resistant AMLs, but are not seen in the sensitive leukaemia. b,
Southern blot analysis of paired sensitive and resistant AML #6537 with a Mapk14 probe.
The resistant leukaemias shown in lanes CI and PD show a Mapk14 hybridization fragment,
which overlaps with one of the MOL4070LTR bands in the resistant leukaemias shown in
panel a. c, Basal p38 kinase activity of resistant AML #6537 cells (solid line) is reduced in
comparison to the parental leukaemia (heavy dashed line), but remains elevated above WT
bone marrow cells (dotted line). This is a representative example of 3 independent

experiments. d, SB202190 (SB), a p38α inhibitor, antagonizes the ability of CI-1040 (CI) to
reduce blast colony inhibition in parental AML #6537 (solid white bars, n=7) in the presence
of GM-CSF (GM). Blast colony growth of sensitive AML #6537 is significantly increased
by the addition of SB to CI-1040 (*p= 0.0043; unpaired t-test). By contrast, CI-1040 (2.5
µM) has a inhibitory effect on WT CFU-GM colony (solid black bars, n=8) and resistant
AML #6537 (chequered bars, n=5) blast colony growth, which is not affected by 2.5 µM
SB202190. Error bars represent the s.e.m.
