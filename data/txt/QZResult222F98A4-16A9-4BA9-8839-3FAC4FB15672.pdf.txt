ABSTRACT
Human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas are one of the most difficult cancers
to treat. In our study, Lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-CoA
(HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, demonstrated anticancer properties by inhibiting
cancer cell proliferation, cell migration and cell adhesion. Lovastatin inhibited the
expressions of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2,
and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Furthermore, lovastatin inhibited
the expressions of integrin β1 and integrin β3 but not integrin αv or integrin β5.
While Lovastatin’s inhibitory effects on TGFβ1, COX2, and ICAM-1 expression were
independently controlled by the tumor suppressor LKB1, integrin β3 expression was
not affected. Lovastatin’s inhibitory effect on cell adhesion was associated with the
decreased expression of integrin β3 and cell surface heterodimer integrin αvβ3.
Quantitative real time PCR, fluorescent microscopy, and cell migration assays all
confirmed that Lovastatin inhibits integrin αvβ3 downstream signaling including FAK
activation, and β-catenin, vimentin, ZO-1, and β-actin. Overall, Lovastatin reduced
tumor cell proliferation and migration by modifying the expression of genes involved
in cell adhesion and other critical cellular processes. Our study highlights novel
anti-cancer properties of Lovastatin and supports further exploration of statins in the
context of cholangiocarcinoma therapy.

INTRODUCTION

pathogenesis. Those cell surface integrins are known
to regulate cell proliferation [4], migration [5], invasion
[1, 5], angiogenesis [6], and adhesion [7].

Cholangiocarcinomas are malignant tumors of the
biliary tract and are the second most common type of
primary liver cancer. Biliary tract cancer is associated
with a high mortality rate due to its difficulty of early
detection and resistance to most chemotherapeutic agents.
Several integrins expressed in cholangiocarcinomas
[1–3] have been reported in studies related to cancer

3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase
inhibitors, also called statins, are commonly used as
lipid-lowering drugs that inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis
[8]. Statins inhibit the production of isoprenoids and thus
block the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway [9]. They are

used therapeutically to upregulate low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) receptor-mediated removal of plasma cholesterol
in the liver. In addition to their lipid-lowering properties,
statins have been linked to a variety of physiological
processes. Lovastatin can delay the onset and progression
of diabetic nephropathies in part, through suppressing
the glomerular expression of TGF-β1, independent of
its cholesterol-lowering effect [10]. Simvastatin can
influence alveolar bone remodeling by regulating the
expression of growth factors crucial to osteogenesis
[11]. It also inhibits transforming growth factor
(TGF)-β1-induced fibronectin expression in asthmatic
fibroblasts [12]. In the context of cancer, simvastatin
mediates suppress prostate cancer PC3 micrometastasis
through inhibition of integrin αvβ3 activity and
suppression of the interaction between prostate cancer
cell integrin αvβ3 and endothelial intercellular adhesion
molecule (ICAM)-1 [13]. Simvastatin has also been
found to reduce tumor cell adhesion in human peritoneal
mesothelial cells by decreasing expressions of VCAM-1
and β1 integrin [14]. Studies on lovastatin suggest that
it can also induce cytoskeletal alterations and ultimately
modulate adhesion, motility, and proteolysis [15].
Recent studies have started to explore the possibility
of using statins to treat bile duct cancers [16–22]. In
fact, clinical studies have looked at bile duct cancer in
simvistatin monotherapy [23] or combination therapy
with anti-cancer drug, S-1 [16]. Simvastatin stimulates
anti-proliferation in cholangiocarcinomas by inhibiting
Rac1 activity [23] or downregulating E2F-1/TS
[16, 23]. Similar studies have reported about
lovastatin in inhibiting cell proliferation by depleting
geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate through Skp2 pathway
degradation [24]. Lovastatin also shows to overcome
gefitinib-resistance cholangiocarcinomas [25], and
enhance adenovirus-mediated TRAIL induced apoptosis
in prostate cancer [26]. Overall, statins seem to reduce
the risk of cholangiocarcinomas [27]. However, this exact
mechanism remains to be fully understood.

Lovastatin regulates gene expressions in HuH-28
and RBE human cholangiocarcinoma cells
In order to investigate the anti-proliferation
mechanisms associated with lovastatin, several diagnostic
markers of cholangiocarcinomas were studied in
cells treated with lovastatin (Figure 1A). As shown in
Figure 1B and 1C, lovastatin inhibited the expression of
integrin β1 and integrin β3, but not integrin αv or integrin
β5. At the same time, the expression of TGF-β1, COX-2, and
ICAM-1 were also inhibited by lovastatin (Figure 2). These
results indicate that lovastatin changes the expression of
several genes in cholangiocarcinomas through multiple
pathways.

Multiple mechanisms are involved in
lovastatin-induced anti-proliferation in
cholangiocarcinomas
Known for its ability to reduce cholesterol synthesis,
lovastatin was tested for its ability to decrease cholesterol
levels in human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell
lines. RBE and HuH-28 cells (108 cells/dish) were treated
with lovastatin for 24 h. MβCD was used as a positive
control of cholesterol depletion. A decrease in cholesterol
levels correlated with increased lovastatin concentrations
in a dose dependent manner (Figure 2A). Compared to
HuH-28, RBE cells were more sensitive to lovastatin
in terms of cellular cholesterol levels. In order to
elucidate the potential role of lovastatin in cancer gene
expression, lovastatin-treated HuH-28 and RBE cells were
harvested and qPCR was used to quantify expression of
integrin β3, TGFβ1, ICAM-1, and COX-2. Results in
Figure 2B indicate that both lovastatin and MβCD reduced
the expression of integrin β3. But unlike MβCD, only
lovastatin decreased the expressions of TGFβ1, COX2,
and ICAM-1. Lovastatin was reported to induce LKB1
activation. After knockdown of LKB1 gene (Figure 2C),
we found decreased expression of TGFβ1, COX2, and
ICAM-1 (Figure 2D). In contrast, inhibition of integrin
β3 mRNA accumulation by lovastatin was enhanced
(Figure 2D). These results suggest that lovastatin affects
expression of genes via different mechanisms.

We hypothesize that lovastatin is able to inhibit
proliferation, cell migration and cellular adhesion
in cholangiocarcinomas through the integrin and
TGF-β1-dependent pathways. In this study, two human
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, RBE and
HuH-28, were treated with lovastatin and multiple studies
including, qPCR, flow cytomemetry, cell migration
assay, and trypan blue exclusion assay were conducted to
demonstrate our theory on lovastatin’s anti-proliferative
properties on cellular mechanisms. Overall, this study
confirmed the therapeutic potential of lovastatin against
human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and provided
support for further investigation of statins in relation to
cancer therapy and drug development.

Lovastatin inhibits cancer cell adhesion by
inhibiting presentation of the cell surface
integrin, αvβ3

(Figure 3). It was interesting to note Lovastatin’s
downstream signaling effects. Results in Figure 3 indicate
that lovastatin suppressed the accumulation of integrin
β3 and decreased signaling molecules downstream to
integrin β3, including p-FAK, vimentin, ZO-1, and
β-catenin. Decreased β-actin-induced filament fragments
were also observed in cells treated with lovastatin
(Figure 4). These results suggest that lovastatin inhibits
cellular migration and actin filamentation by inhibiting
integrin β3 expression and function.

To confirm whether lovastatin-induced integrin
expression is involved in anti-proliferation, we studied
heterodimers of the cell surface integrin (αvβ3) through
flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 5A, heterodimers
of the cell surface integrin αvβ3 were downregulated by
lovastatin exposure in both cell lines. Moreover, lovastatin
exposure to HuH-28 and RBE cell lines negatively

Lovastatin inhibits cell proliferation

cholangiocarcinoma cells

impacted the ability of αvβ3 to adhere to fibronectin
(Figure 5B). Overall, as the exposure to lovastatin
increased, cellular adhesion properties of HuH-28 and
RBE cells decreased (Figure 5C). Studies of fluorescence
microscopy confirmed the morphological cellular changes
induced by lovastatin (Figure 5D). These results suggest
that lovastatin reduced the expression of integrin β3 and
its presentation on the cell surface, thus affecting growth,
adhesion, morphology, and migration of cancer cells.

In order to examine the antiproliferative effect of
lovastatin, RBE and HuH-28 cells (103 cells/well), were
treated with lovastatin for 72 h. The antiproliferative
effect was quantified by calculating cell number. Trypan
blue exclusion was used. Our data confirmed that
lovastatin inhibited cell proliferation in both bile duct
cancer cell lines (Figure 6A). The effect of lovastatin on

DISCUSSION

cell migration was also studied. RBE and HuH-28 cells
(105 cells/well) were seeded in the upper chamber of a
transwell using the Millipore system for cell migration.
Lovastatin reduced cell migration in both cancer cell
lines (Figure 6B). Ultimately, these results suggest that
lovastatin has ability to reduce cell proliferation and
migration in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines.
These results also suggest that the lovastatin
activates two signal transduction pathways to induce
anticancer progression. One pathway involves the
expression of integrin β3/β1, which affects FAK activity,
downstream gene expression and signal transduction.
The other pathway is via LKB1 activation, which inhibits
TGF-β activity and downstream biological activities.
Cross-talk between these two pathways likely induces
anti-proliferation and inhibits cancer migration and
metastasis.

Lovastatin inhibited proliferation of RBE and
HuH-28 human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells
(Figure 6A). Lovastatin exposure decreased cellular
attachment (Figure 5C) and induced changes in cell
morphology and integrity (Figure 5D). Because exposure to
MβCD and lovastatin induced similar results (Figure 5D),
cholesterol depletion by MβCD causes anoikis-like
apoptosis, which in A431 cells involved decreased raft
levels, Bcl-xL downregulation, caspase-3 activation, and
Akt inactivation regardless of epidermal growth factor
receptor activation [28]. Pretreatment with cholesterol alone
stimulated an increase in the number of viable cells in MzChA-1 cholangiocarcinoma cells, and fully restored cell
viability following simvastatin treatment [23]. These studies
suggest that the exact mechanism of lovastatin-induced antiproliferation may involve cholesterol depletion.

including integrin β3, p-FAK, vimentin, ZO-1, and β-actin, were detected using Western blotting analyses. Student’s t test was conducted

While exposure to lovastatin and MβCD both
reduced the expression of integrin β3 (Figure 2B), only
lovastatin decreased the expressions of TGFβ1, COX2, and
ICAM-1 (Figure 2B), suggesting that cholesterol depletion
may not be the only mechanism involved in lovastatininduced anti-proliferation. LKB1-phosphorylation of
Smad4 at Thr-77 of its DNA-binding domain inhibits
Smad4 from binding to TGF-β-specific promoter
sequences; this correlates with the negative regulatory
effect that LKB1 exerts on Smad4-dependent transcription
[29]. Lovastatin is reported to induce LKB1 activation
[25, 30]. Both ICAM-1 and COX2 are stimulated by
TGF-β1 [31, 32]. After knockdown of LKB1 gene
expression, lovastatin-induced inhibitory effects on
the expressions of TGFβ1, COX2, and ICAM-1 were
reduced (Figure 2D). These results indicate that lovastatin
suppresses the expressions of TGFβ1, COX2, and ICAM-1
through LKB1 activation.

[34]. Those studies suggested that lovastatin is able to inhibit
cancer migration and metastasis by downregulating either the
FAK-ERK1/2 or FAK-PI3K pathway.
Statins reduce the isoprenoids, farnesyl and
geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, which are essential
intermediates in cellular events and properties, including
cytoskeletal integrity, adhesion, migration, and viability
[35]. Simvastatin disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and
focal adhesion complexes by a cholesterol synthesisindependent mechanism [35]. However, results indicated
that lovastatin inhibited integrin β3 by cholesterol
depletion in present studies (Figure 2). Furthermore,
β-catenin, a downstream signal of integrin β3, was
simultaneously reduced in lovastatin treatment. Moreover,
when β-catenin decreases, related proteins such as FAK,
VE-cadherin, vinculin, and β-actin simultaneously
decreases [36]. We postulate that lovastatin inhibits actin
filaments through inhibiting integrin β3.
In conclusion, several mechanisms proposed
from present studies are involved in lovastatin-inhibited
inhibitory effects on proliferation, migration, and
adhesion in cholangiocarincoma. Treatment of human
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas with lovastatin induced
cholesterol depletion and LKB1 activation (Figure 2). The
cholesterol-depleting effect of lovastatin inhibited the
expression of integrin β3 and cell surface heterodimer integrin
αvβ3 presentation. Additionally, the integrin αvβ3 downstream
signaling including FAK activation and organization of
β-catenin, vimentin, ZO-1 and β-actin were inhibited by

Cell migration and cell adhesion abilities were
also blocked by lovastatin (Figures 5B, 5C, 6B).
Lovastatin downregulated the integrin β3/FAK pathway
(Figure 3). It also reduced cell surface integrin αvβ3
expression (Figure 5B) and the binding ability to
fibronectin (Figure 5C). Fibronectin regulates cell
growth in cholangiocarcinomas [33]. Fibronectin is
known to induce activation of FAK via extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or PI3K/Akt to increase matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-9/calpain-2 or MMP-9/RhoA
activity, respectively, and lead to lung cancer metastasis

lovastatin blocked TGF-β expression and activation, which
controls functions of COX2 and ICAM-1 (Figure 2D).
Clinically, patients treated with statins have been
associated with a reduced risk of cholangiocarcinomas

[27]. However, this regulatory mechanism is poorly
understood. Here, we propose a novel pathway in which
lovastatin inhibits human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma
proliferation (Figure 7) and strongly encourage further
studies to explore statins potential therapeutic role in

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
Two human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines
(RBE and HuH-28) were purchased from RIKEN
Bioresource Center (Ibaraki, Japan) and maintained for
the study in RPMI-1640 or minimum essential medium
(MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and P/S
solution (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C.

Transwell cell migration assay
A cell migration assay was conducted with a
transwell system. Briefly, cells were trypsinized and
adjusted to 105 cells/ml in a cell suspension. Cells in a
200-μl volume was seeded into the upper chamber of
a transwell, and 800 µl of medium with 10% stripped
FBS was added to the lower chamber. Cells were then
cultured at 37°C for 6 h, and cells were chemoattracted
to pass through the membranes and were quantified
using a fluorometric detection system (Millipore). The
fluorometric signals were determined by an Epoch
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader
(Biotek) at 485/538 nm.

Short hairpin (sh)RNA transfection
Human cholangiocarcinoma cells were seeded
into six-well tissue culture plates until 60%~80%
confluence and maintained in the absence of antibiotics
for 24 h before transfection. The culture medium
was removed before transfection, and cells were
washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
then transfected with short hairpin (sh)-RNA for
LKB1: CATCTACACTCAGGACTTCAC shRNA or
scrambled RNA (2 µg/well) purchased from the National
RNAi Core Facility (Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan)
using lipofectamine 2000 (2 µg/well) in Opti-MEM I
medium according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Invitrogen). After transfection, cultures were incubated
at 37°C for 4 h, and then placed in fresh culture medium.
After an additional 72 h, cells were selected by puromycin.
Selected cells were used in the experiments.

Cell adhesion assay
Cells were trypsinized, washed twice with PBS, and
resuspended in serum-free medium containing lovastatin
at 106 cells/ml. After incubation at 37°C for 30 min, cells
were washed twice with warm medium and resuspended
in serum-free medium at 106 cells/ml, and 200 µl of the
cell suspension was added to 24-well plates coated with
fibronectin. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 0.5, 1.5,
and 3 h. Adherent cells were counted with a CyQUANT
Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Life Technologies), and
the fluorescence was recorded using a plate reader
(Plate CHAMELEON, HIDEX, Turku, Finland) with a
fluorescence filter set (excitation at 485 nm and emission
at 530 nm).

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy
Micro Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands), and
complementary cDNA synthesis was performed using the
RevertAid™ H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). A qPCR was conducted
with 5 µL of DNA combined with 10 µL of IQ SYBR
Green supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), 0.3 µL each
of 20 µM of forward and reverse primers, and 4.7 µL
DNase/RNase-free water. Sequences for the amplified

Cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA
and resuspended in cold PBA (1.0% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) and 0.1% sodium azide in PBS),
followed by incubation with an anti-integrin αvβ3
antibody (Millipore, Temecula, CA) at 4°C for
60 min. After washing in PBA, cells were resuspended
with Alexa Fluor-conjugated second antibodies
(Life Technologies, NY); 1:50 in PBA). After an
additional 60 min at 4°C, cells were washed and analyzed
by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur flow cytometer, Becton

Data analysis and statistics

After treatment, cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer
(10 mM Tris at pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100,
2 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 × protease inhibitor
mixture), and the protein concentration was determined
using a BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).
Cell lysates were separated on sodium dodecylsulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes; the membranes
were probed with antibodies against ZO-1, vimentin, and
GAPDH purchased from Genetex (San Antonio, TX), and
p-Tyr397-FAK purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA). β-Catenin and β-actin were purchased from
BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Integrin β3 was purchased
from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibodies
were either goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) or
rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:3000), depending on the origin
of the primary antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were
detected using the BioSpectrum 810 Imaging System
(UVP).

Immunoblot and nucleotide densities were measured
with a Storm 860 Phosphorimager, followed by analysis
with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics,
Sunnyvale, CA). Student’s t-test was conducted, and
results were considered significant at p < 0.05 (*),

Transwell cell migration assay
A cell migration assay was conducted with a
transwell system. Briefly, cells were trypsinized and
adjusted to 105 cells/ml of a cell suspension. Cells in a
200-μl volume were seeded into the upper chamber
of a transwell, and 800 µl of medium was added with
10% stripped FBS in the lower chamber. Cells were
then cultured at 37°C for 6 h, were chemoattracted
to pass through the membranes, and were quantified
using a fluorometric detection system (Millipore). The
fluorometric signals were determined with a plate reader
(Plate CHAMELEON, HIDEX) at 485/538 nm.
