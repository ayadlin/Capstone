ABSTRACT:
Antibodies are considered as ‘magic bullets’ because of their high specificity. It is
believed that antibodies are too large to routinely enter the cytosol, thus antibody
therapeutic approach has been limited to extracellular or secreted proteins expressed
by cancer cells. However, many oncogenic proteins are localized within the cell.
To explore the possibility of antibody therapies against intracellular targets, we
generated a chimeric antibody targeting the intracellular PRL-3 oncoprotein to
assess its antitumor activities in mice. Remarkably, we observed that the PRL-3
chimeric antibody could efficiently and specifically reduce the formation of PRL-3
expressing metastatic tumors. We further found that natural killer (NK) cells were
important in mediating the therapeutic effect, which was only observed in a nude
mouse model (T-cell deficient), but not in a Severe Combined Immunodeficiency’
(scid) mouse model (B- and T-cell deficient), indicating the anticancer effect also
depends on host B-cell activity. Our study involving 377 nude and scid mice suggests
that antibodies targeting intracellular proteins can be developed to treat cancer.

INTRODUCTION

been limited to surface or secreted proteins expressed by
cancer cells [4], since antibody targeting of intracellular
oncoproteins was previously thought to be unfeasible
because of the intracellular location of the targets.
As a consequence, a wide spectrum of intracellular
oncoproteins remains unexplored in terms of antibody
therapy approach. In 1978, Donato Alarcon-Segovia first
discovered that antibodies could reach inside living cells
[5]. Subsequently, the concept that intact antibodies are
unable to gain entry into viable cells has been challenged
experimentally as well as clinically. Over the past 2
decades, immunologists have shown that 1) autoantibodies

A century ago, Paul Ehrlich proposed the concept
of antibodies as ‘magic bullets’, the use of therapeutic
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against a number of
disease targets validated this concept [1-3]. In general,
antibody targeted therapy has much reduced toxicity than
chemotherapy with small molecular weight chemical
inhibitors [2]. Antibodies constitute the most rapidly
growing class of human therapeutics and are ideal agents
for recognizing and destroying malignant cells via the
immune system. However, this therapeutic approach has

found in the serum of autoimmune disease patients could
bind to their respective intracellular antigens, and 2)
immunologically mediated damage might occur when
antibodies enter a living cell triggering apoptosis [6-8].
Consistently, it is demonstrated here that antibodies to
an intracellular protein can exert therapeutic effects and
suggest new insights to the use of therapeutic antibodies
to include intracellular targets.
PRL-1 (phosphatase of regenerating liver-1),
PRL-2, and PRL-3 represent an intriguing subgroup of
the intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP).
Individual PRLs are overexpressed in a variety of
cancer cell lines and cancer tissues when compared
with their normal counterparts [9] and are reported to
play multiple roles in cancer progression [10]. PRLs are
intracellular C-terminally prenylated phosphatases. The
localization of PRL-1 and PRL-3 to the inner leaflet of
the plasma membrane and early endosomes was shown by
electron microscopy (EM) immunogold labeling [11,12].
In contrast, the mutant forms of PRLs that lack the
prenylation signal are localized in nuclei [13]. PRL-3 was
first discovered as a metastasis-associated phosphatase
in colorectal cancer metastasis, being consistently
overexpressed in 100% of liver metastasis samples
taken from 18 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients [14].
Overexpression of PRLs has been subsequently shown to

have a causative role in promoting cancer metastases and
they become potential targets for diverse cancer treatment
[15]. As these phosphatases are intracellularly localized,
the conventional approach using therapeutic antibodies
would seem implausible. However, we recently reported
an unexpected observation that mouse monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) against PRL-1 or PRL-3 were able
to prevent the experimental metastasis of cancer cells
overexpressing intracellular PRL-1 or PRL-3 [16].
To extend our earlier findings, in this current
study, we expanded upon the reliability of such
targeting strategy using a newly-generated mouse/
human chimeric monoclonal PRL-3 antibody as
a potential clinical therapeutic agent against cancer in five
important aspects. Firstly, clinically-relevant chimeric
antibodies instead of mouse antibodies were generated
and characterized. Secondly, mice harboring naturallyoccurring human cancer cells that express endogenous
PRL-3 instead of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells
expressing exogenous PRL-3 were treated. Thirdly, it was
shown that depletion of nature killer (NK) cells abolished
the therapeutic response and aggravated tumor burden in
mice. Fourthly, by using paired nude versus scid mouse
models, a crucial role for B-cells in determining the
outcome of our antibody therapy was identified. Finally,
using the IVIS live imaging system, fluorescent labeled

RESULTS

antibodies were used to track their tumor binding activities
and their working models. An evidence-based concept
is hereby proposed for a possible approach in targeting
intracellular oncoproteins with antibody therapies. The
results suggest that an evaluation of a wide spectrum of
intracellular oncoproteins (such as phosphatases, kinases,
transcription factors, and many others) as possible targets
for anticancer therapy may be warranted.

in nude mice [16]. In an attempt to translate these
laboratory findings to clinical setting, a mouse/human
chimeric mAb against PRL-3 was engineered to minimize
the potential antigenicity of the mouse mAb in human.
Using recombinant DNA technology, we separately fused
the constant domains of heavy or light chains of the
human IgG1 molecule with the mouse variable regions
of PRL-3 mAb (clone m318) by transgenic fusion of the
immunoglobulin genes (Fig. 1A) [17,18]. The expression
construct was transfected into Human Embryonic Kidney
(HEK) 293T cells to produce recombinant PRL-3 chimeric
mAb that was then harvested from the culture medium
and further concentrated. The antigen-binding specificity
of the PRL-3 chimeric antibody was well conserved as
confirmed by indirect immuofluorescence on DLD-1
cells that overexpress exogenous EGFP-PRL-3 (Fig.
1B) and western blot analyses (Fig. 1C). The PRL-3
chimeric mAb (h318) specifically recognized both EGFPPRL-3 (~48 kDa) and myc-PRL-3 (~21 kDa) (Fig. 1C,
lane 1-2) but react with neither myc-PRL-1 nor mycPRL-2 proteins (Fig. 1C, lane 3-4). A 50% cell Inhibitory
Cytotoxic concentration (IC50) of the chimeric antibody
was determined on a mouse melanoma B16F0 cell line
that expresses endogenous PRL-3 protein. No cellular
toxicity was observed in in vitro culture system even at
concentrations as high as 40 µg/ml (Fig. S1), suggesting
that the antibody itself had no adverse effect on cultured
cells.

cells, PRL-3 chimeric antibodies were administrated
similarly via tail veins into the ‘treated’ mice, followed
by two subsequent administrations of the antibody per
week (Fig. 2B). ‘Untreated’ mice were administered with
PBS (or control ascites). On day 17, the ‘treated’ mice
appeared more active and healthier. The metastatic tumors
in multiple tissues were dramatically reduced in ‘treated’
mice (Fig. 2C, right panel). The Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis for these B16F0 recipients will be discussed
in a later section. In a parallel experiment, the PRL-3
chimeric antibody had no effect in blocking metastatic
tumors formed by B16F10 cancer cells that express low
or undetectable level of PRL-3 protein. Hundreds of
metastatic tumors were found in the lungs of all B16F10
recipients, and no obvious difference was seen between
‘untreated’ (Fig. 2D, left panel) and ‘treated’ mice (Fig.
2D, right panel). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis demonstrated that the PRL-3 chimeric antibody
did not significantly extend the life-span for B16F10
recipients with a median survival of 16 days for ‘untreated’
and 17 days for ‘treated’ mice (Fig. 2E, p = 0.5428).

PRL-3 chimeric antibodies effectively inhibit the
metastatic tumors formed by human cancer cells
that express endogenous PRL-3
In addition to the B16F0 cell line, three additional
high PRL-3-expressing cell lines were identified: HCT116,
a human colorectal cancer cell line; HCT116-luc2, a
HCT116 cell line that was established by transducing
lentivirus containing the luciferase 2 gene (luc2) under
the control of human ubiquitin C promoter; and A2780,
a human ovarian cancer cell line (Fig. 3A lanes 1-3).
A2780 has been reported as a PRL-3 positive cell line
previously [20]. As a negative control, we identified a
PRL-3 negative cancer cell line: NCI-H460, derived
from human non-small lung cancer (Fig. 3A, lane 4). It is
worth highlighting that regardless of PRL-3 expression,
these four cancer cell lines could rapidly form metastatic
tumors in nude mice within 1-2 months (Fig. 3, ‘untreated’
mice). The HCT116-luc2 cell line together with Xenogen’s
in-vivo imaging system (IVIS) was used to monitor
metastatic lung tumor formation in mice. Remarkably,
the PRL-3 antibody could inhibit metastasis of HCT116luc2 cancer cells, with a clear reduction of metastatic
lung tumors (in blue) in live imaging after 7 weeks of
antibody therapy, compared to ‘untreated’ mice (Fig. 3B,
right panel). Similarly, overt phenotypic differences were
found between PRL-3 antibody ‘treated’ and ‘untreated’
mice at 2-month post-inoculation with HCT116 cells (Fig.
3C, a) and at 1-month post-inoculation with A2780 cells
(Fig. 3C, b). PRL-3 chimeric antibody-treated animals
appeared vibrant and healthy (up to 4-months), whereas
all ‘untreated’ mice had lost weight and were moribund. In
parallel, NCI-H460 (PRL-3 negative cells) recipients did

PRL-3 chimeric antibody effectively inhibits the
metastatic tumors formed by mouse cancer cells
that express endogenous PRL-3
To find a clinically relevant animal model to treat
PRL-3-associated cancers, dozens of cancer cell lines for
the expression of endogenous PRL-3 protein levels were
screened by Western blot analysis. Ideal cell line pairs for
our animal models should present contrasting levels of
endogenous PRL-3 and should have the ability to induce
metastatic tumors in mice within short timeframes. We
found a pair of mouse melanoma cell lines B16F0 and
B16F10 that fulfilled these criteria. Although B16F10 cells
are naturally more metastatic than B16F0 cells, parental
B16F0 cells express higher levels of endogenous PRL-3
protein than B16F10 cells (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the
metastatic activity of B16F10 cells might be no longer
PRL-3 dependent. When we employed an experimental
metastatic assay [19] in which cultured cancer cells were
introduced into the circulation of nude mice by lateral
tail vein injection, both B16F0 and B16F10 cells rapidly
formed multiple metastatic tumors in mice within 17
days. This aggressive in vivo metastasis model allowed
testing of the differences in efficacy between ‘treated’
and ‘untreated’ groups shortly after antibody therapy. On

were regarded as lacking an effective outcome. Using
this baseline, a clear beneficial effect was seen in mice
inoculated with PRL-3 positive (but not negative) cells.
The efficiency of both mouse- and chimeric-PRL-3
antibody therapy regimes were comparable (Figure 3D).
Overall, these results further support the conclusion that
the efficiency of the PRL-3 antibody treatment is tightly

NK cells, we pre-injected nude mice with antibodies
against asialo GM-1 NK cell-surface glycolipid, a
procedure which has been shown to effectively eliminate
NK cell activity [21, 22]. Thereafter, the above-mentioned
procedures of the antibody therapy were repeated using
B16F0 in these anti-asialo-GM1-injected nude mice. It
was found that the therapeutic efficacy of our chimeric
PRL-3 antibody was essentially lost in anti-asialo-GM1-injected mice (Fig. S2). In support of the anti-tumor
role of NK cells, anti-asialo-GM1-injected nude mice
showed more severe tumors (in black)-bearing burden
in lung, liver, adrenal, and testis than in mice without
NK cell inhibition. Collectively, these results indicate
the importance of the innate immune system and
support a role for NK cells in mediating the intracellular

NK cells are important in anticancer therapy
The efficacy of PRL-3 chimeric antibody in
inhibiting PRL-3-tumor formation observed in nude
mice suggest that T lymphocytes may not be essential
in this antibody therapy since nude mice lack of mature
T lymphocytes. We then investigated if Fc-binding,
cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells might play a role in
the PRL-3 antibody therapy as NK cells are a subset of
cytotoxic lymphocytes that constitute a major component
of the innate immune system. To deplete the nude mice’s

antibody therapeutic response. Since NK cells have been
demonstrated to have a role in human hematopoietic stem
cell graft rejection [22], removal of NK cells may result in
abolishment of graft rejection of NK cell activities, leading
to tumor engraftment more successfully; indeed, we found
‘asialo-GM1- & PRL-3-treated’ mice were worse than
‘untreated’ mice in terms of tumor growth (Fig. S2).

dependent elimination of the PRL-3 expressing cell.
However, to date, no reports describe a cell surface
localization of PRL-3. To address the possibility of PRL-3
antibody binding its antigen on the cell surface, we used
a FACS assay routinely used in cell surface labeling. As
a positive control, anti-EGFR antibody binding of the
EGFR-overexpressing human epidermoid carcinoma A431
cell line was used for this assay. Incubation of A431 cells
with anti-EGFR antibodies caused a distinct peak-shift in
the FACS assay (Fig. 5A, a). However, no peak shift was
observed in either B16F0 (PRL-3 positive) or B16F10
(PRL-3 negative) cells incubated with or without antiPRL-3 antibody (Fig. 5A, b-c). These results implied that
extracellular PRL-3 protein, if any, was unlikely to be the
major cause of antibody binding. However, since immune
system constantly battles invaders, such as bacteria and
viruses, and cancer cells in vivo, the cancer cells could be
destroyed and lysed to expose their intracellular proteins to
the immune system and produce a localised inflammatory
reaction to trigger cell death. If so, the same explanation
may apply to PRL-3 and other intracellular oncoproteins
as well.

B-cells may play a role to mediate the therapeutic
effects of PRL-3 antibodies
To next address if B lymphocytes were also critical
to our antibody therapy model, we compared the efficacy
of antibody therapy between nude mice (lacking mature
T-cells) and Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (scid)
mice (lacking both mature T- and B-cells). These mice
were i.v. injected with PRL-3 expressing cancer cells. In
HCT116-injected nude mice (Fig. 4A, a: Nude-HCT116),
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a statistically
significant (p = 0.0013) in survival of ‘treated’ mice (16
weeks) compared to ‘untreated’ mice (11.5 weeks). In
contrast, in HCT116-injected scid mice (Fig. 4A, b: ScidHCT116), we observed that PRL-3 antibody therapy did
not significantly (p = 0.4785) prolong the overall survival
of Scid-HCT116 mice, with a median survival of 11week for ‘treated’ and 10-week for ‘untreated’ mice. To
further confirm the importance of B cells in responding
to antibody therapies, another PRL-3-expressing cell line
(B16F0) was used. In B16F0-injected nude mice (Fig. 4A,
c: Nude-B16F0), Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed
that PRL-3 antibody treatment significantly increased
median survival duration by 33% (24 days for ‘treated’,
versus 18 days for ‘untreated’; p = 0.0001). Consistently,
in B16F0-injected scid mice (Fig. 4A, d: Scid-B16F0),
the antibodies had no effect in ‘treated’ mice, with both
‘untreated’ and ‘treated’ groups showing similar median
life-span (18.5 and 18 days respectively; p = 0.4545).
As before, the therapeutic efficacy was independent of
antibody species, as similar results were obtained using
either mouse or chimeric PRL-3 antibodies (Fig. 4B,
black or green column). Collectively, the results from
these genetic mouse models suggest that PRL-3 antibody
therapeutic efficacy against PRL-3 metastatic tumor
formation is dependent on host B-cell but not T cells.
Other than antibody production, we hypothesized that
B-cell may have additional functions; such as the secretion
of unknown factor(s) that could facilitate the action of
antibodies.

In-Vivo Imaging System (IVIS) live imagingbased working models
To investigate if PRL-3 mAb can bind and reach
to PRL-3 metastatic tumors, we used fluorescent labeled
PRL-3 mAb to track sites of metastatic tumors. It was
observed that the strong fluorescent labeled PRL-3
antibodies were concentrated at the lung filled with PRL3 metastatic tumors (Figure 5B), suggesting that the
fluorescent labeled antibodies can arrive at the metastatic
lung tumors in vivo. With the current clinical practice
of assessing whether the cancer is Her2-positive before
considering the Herceptin antibody therapy [23], a similar
approach can be used for antibodies which target the PRL3 intracellular oncoprotein to prevent further spreading or
relapse in PRL-3 positive cancer patients. Other than using
PRL-3 mouse antibody to perform IHC test on cancer
biopsy in order to identify PRL-3 positive patients, the
IVIS live imaging system may serve as another method
to screen PRL-3 positive cancer patients for the treatment
using the PRL-3 chimeric antibody.

PRL-3 chimeric antibody is likely to have broad
applications in inhibiting PRL-3 positive cancers
Genes specifically upregulated during tumor
formation but poorly or not expressed in host tissues are
particularly promising as tumor-specific targets. PRL-3
was reported to be upregulated in multiple human cancers
[24, 25] and was not detected in most of the mouse
tissues (Fig. S3A). Therefore, PRL-3 fulfills the criteria
to be validated as a biomarker and a target for anticancer

PRL-3 antigen is insignificantly present at the cell
surface
A possible mechanism of PRL-3 antibody action
could be its binding of PRL-3 encoded cell surface
antigen(s), thereby triggering a B-cell and/or NK-cell

its antigen in cancer cells. We demonstrated here that the
PRL-3 chimeric antibody could successfully block the
formation of metastatic tumors derived from several
cancer cell lines (B16F0, HCT-116, and A2780) that
express intracellular PRL-3 phosphatase. The inhibition
was specific as the antibody had no effect in blocking the
formation of metastatic tumors derived from other cancer
cell lines (B16F10, H460) that did not express PRL-3. Our
previous results had demonstrated that mouse PRL-3
antibody had no effect in inhibiting metastatic lung tumors
formed by CT26 mouse colon cells, another PRL-3
negative cancer cell line [16]. Together, the data support
the notion that the efficiency of both mouse and chimeric
PRL-3 antibody treatment is tightly correlated with PRL-3
expression status of the cancer cells. If the metastatic
property of cancer cells was not associated with PRL-3
expression (such as B16F10, H460, CT26 cell lines), the
administration of PRL-3 mAb would have no effect in
blocking tumors formed by these PRL-3 negative cells.
Furthermore, we previously [16] had shown that PRL-1
mAb specifically blocks PRL-1 (but not PRL-3) metastatic
tumors; while PRL-3 mAb specifically blocks PRL-3 (but
not PRL-1) metastatic tumors. This is especially
remarkable because PRL-1 and PRL-3 share high
homology (76%) in protein sequence. Collectively, these
results imply that PRL antibody therapy is highly specific
to its antigen and does not involve cross-reactivity with
other non-specific cell surface proteins. 2) Not all
intracellular oncoproteins are viable targets for antibody
therapy. Desirable anti-cancer therapeutic agents should
specifically target cancer cells while leaving normal
tissues unharmed. It should be emphasized that the PRL-3
chimeric antibody therapy has little detectable side effect
in nude mice as PRL-3 expression in normal tissues is not
ubiquitous. We showed that PRL-3 protein was detected in
only a few organs such as the spleen, brain, and pancreas
(Fig. S3A). In contrast, PRL-2 is ubiquitously expressed
in most of the mouse tissues (Fig. S3B). As expected,
PRL-2 antibody therapy to PRL-2 expressing cancers was
unsuccessful (Fig. S3C), and PRL-2 antibody-treated mice
died 1-week earlier or showed worse outcome than
‘untreated’ mice, likely due to the side effect of antiPRL-2 antibody causing normal PRL-2-expressing tissues
to be targeted by the PRL-2 antibodies. Thus, the choice of
a good therapeutic target should be tumor-specific to avoid
harming host normal tissues. 3) NK cells of the innate
immune system are involved. To understand if innate
immune system was involved in antibody therapy, we
intravenously injected anti-asialo-GM1 antibody via tail
vein into nude mice to deplete NK cells, which are a type
of cytotoxic lymphocytes that constitute a major
component of the innate immune system. In the absence of
NK cell activity, we found that anti-PRL-3 antibody lost
therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, tumor-engraftment was
dramatically enhanced (Fig. S2), indicating that NK cells
normally play a critical role in graft-rejection for

therapy. We anticipate that the PRL-3 antibodies are
likely to have broad applications to block multiple types
of PRL-3 positive cancer spreading, especially in some
lethal malignancies such as lung cancers and acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) that often relapse within short
timeframes. Amongst lung cancers, we found PRL-3 is
overexpressed in 31% of squamous cell carcinoma and
26% of adenocarcinoma (Fig. 6A-C), two main subtypes
of highly recurrent non-small cell lung carcinoma
comprising 80% of human lung cancer. We also found that
PRL-3 is overexpressed in 35% (24 out of 69 cases) of
AML bone marrow samples (Fig. 6D).

DISCUSSION
PRL-3 is upregulated in numerous types of human
cancers and is involved in their metastasis [10, 24, 25].
An evidence-based concept is hereby proposed for a
possible approach in targeting intracellular oncoproteins
with antibody therapy. Using different mouse models and
cancer cell lines, we consistently demonstrated herein that
antibodies to intracellular PRL-3 protein could specifically
exert therapeutic effects. It is anticipated that the PRL3 chimeric antibody is likely to have broad applications
in blocking the progression of different types of PRL-3
positive cancers, particularly in malignancies such as lung
cancers and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that often
relapse within short time frames. Therefore, therapeutic
effects will be more apparent after treatment in acute
cancers, when compared with ‘untreated’ PRL-3 positive
patients.
Currently, our understanding of how PRL-3
antibodies inhibit PRL-3-positive tumors in vivo is limited.
Despite previously proposing several possible mechanisms
of action based on in vitro data on how antibodies may
access to cancer cells [16], the precise mechanism(s)
behind these findings is still an active area of research.
However, it is of important to note that the precise
mechanism(s) of anti-HER2/neu antibody therapy is not
yet understood even though the anti-HER2/neu antibody
has been used clinically for more than a decade for treating
breast cancers [23]. We demonstrate a lack of PRL-3
antibody cytotoxic effect in vitro, even at high antibody
concentrations (Fig. S1), suggesting that using in vitro cell
culture systems to elucidate the mechanism of intracellular
antibody therapy is not representative because the cell
culture system is too simplified due to the limitation of a
single cell type grown in vitro, lacking the interplay of
complex in-vivo systems - omission of critical interactions
with the tumor microenvironment. Nevertheless, from the
results in this study, our reproducible observations here
and elsewhere indicate that intracellular oncoproteins are
viable targets for anticancer therapy. We highlight the
following points to be considered before translating these
results into clinical applications: 1) Antibody treatment
efficacy is tightly correlated with the expression status of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

167

implantation of foreign cells. Evidence also suggests that
NK cells play an important part in the destruction of
incipient tumors [21]. 4) Antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC) may also be involved. The best
characterized mechanism of antibody therapy is antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In ADCC,
antibodies bind to specific cell surface antigens and trigger
an Fc-mediated immune response involving cytotoxic
CD8 T-cells, complement activation, and/or NK cell
activity. Although we did not observe any peak-shifts in
our FACS analysis of PRL-3 cell surface antigen in neither
PRL-3-expressing B16F0 cells nor PRL-3 low-expressing
B16F10 cells, we could not rule out a possibility that these
cancer cells were under abnormal inflammatory pressure,
which may cause the destruction of cancer cells releasing
their intracellular protein. This enables the antigenantibody reaction to trigger specific immune response with
lymphocytes removing these cancer cells. Alternatively, in
vivo, cancer cells are under hypoxic stress steps and serum
deprivation, conditions that arrest cells at G and G phases
[26]. It is possible that these conditions may cause release
of intracellular antigens for antibody recognition. If so,
other intracellular oncoproteins may also encounter the
similar situations, and could therefore be similarly targeted
with antibody therapy. 5) The adaptive immune system is
important in eliciting mAb therapeutic effect. We observed
a therapeutic effect only in nude mice but not in scid mice
in our antibody therapy experiments. The major
differences between nude and scid mice are that nude mice
are T-cell deficient, but have functional IgM antibodies
and B cells, whereas scid mice have no functional adaptive
immune system including B-cells, T-cells, IgM and other
antibodies. Both nude and scid mice, however, have intact
innate immune systems including normal NK cell and
complement activity. The positive response seen only in
nude (but not in scid) mice, indicates that mature B cells
(but not T cell), and possibly IgM/serum antibodies, are
more important and might co-ordinate with the innate
immune system in generating the anticancer response
observed here. Since the PRL-3 antibodies here were
exogenously introduced into mice, we hypothesize that the
requirement of B-cells for antibody activity might be due
to an alternative role for B-cell in the antibody response,
possibly via secretion of unidentified factor(s) that
modulates the host response. Herein, we emphasize that
the intricate interplay of innate and acquired immune
system is crucial for the anticancer efficacy of a chimeric
antibody targeting intracellular PRL-3 oncoprotein. 6)
Antibody therapy against intracellular oncoprotein is
clinically relevant. To generate an aggressive cancer
model for antibody treatment, we directly injected 1
million cancer cells into mouse blood circulation. Given
that the total blood volume in nude mouse is 8% of its
body weight (8% of ~19g = 1.5ml), this translates to the
introduction of approximately 6.7 x 105 cancer cells/mL of
blood. Remarkably, despite such a high cancer cell
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

concentration in blood, we observed overt therapeutic
benefit, despite delaying antibody treatment until 3-day
post-cancer cell injection. In light of this, we hypothesize
that a few injections of chimeric antibody could
significantly reduce the recurrence rate of operable tumors,
as the PRL-3 antibodies continue to act on any remaining
circulating cancer cells [27] by removing non-visible
incipient tumors after surgical resection.
Herein, we have conducted the first chimeric
antibody study in targeting an intracellular oncoprotein
(PRL-3, in this case) for cancer therapy in mice. We also
recently proposed that other intracellular oncoproteins
could also be targeted with antibody therapy and/or
vaccination [28]. The lack of observable side effects in
nude mice upon PRL-3 antibody therapy further alludes to
its potential clinical benefits. As with the current clinical
practice of assessing the Her2-status of cancers before
considering Herceptin antibody therapy [29], a similar
approach could be used for antibody targeting PRL-3
intracellular oncoprotein to circumvent further spreading
or relapse in PRL-3 positive cancer patients. Importantly,
our data prompts an evaluation of a wide spectrum of
tumor-specific intracellular oncoproteins as possible
targets for anti-cancer mAb therapy, thus realizing the full
potential of antibodies as ‘magic bullets’.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Generation of specific PRL-3 human/mouse
chimeric mAb (clone #318)
To generate PRL-3 chimeric mAb, total RNA was
extracted from 6 x 106 hybridoma cells (clone #318) [17]
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Cat #74104). The
RNAs were then reverse-transcribed into cDNA using
SuperScript II RNase H (Invitrogen, Cat 18064-014). The
resulting total cDNAs were used as templates to generate
the ‘universal variable region’. The Ig-Primer Sets
(Novagen, Cat #69831-3) were designed for amplification
by PCR (950C-40C-720C, 30 cycles) to specifically
amplify of immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region of lightand heavy-chain cDNAs from mouse sources. The PCR
fragments were cloned into the PCRII-TOPO-Vector with
a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Cat #45-0640). Appropriately
designed oligonucleotide primer sets enable these variable
region of light- and heavy-chain cDNAs to be cloned into
the respective sites of a human IgG1 constant region
expression vector-pCMV-human IgG1[18] to join the
mouse variable region with the human IgG1 constant
region. The complete construct was transiently transfected
into 293T cells cultured in media supplemented with ultralow IgG FBS (Gibco, 16250-078). The chimeric mAb
was subsequently harvested from the culture supernatant
and concentrated up to 40 folds with centrifugal filter
168

Antibody labeling and IVIS live imaging

devices (Millipore, Cat #UFC900596). The chimeric
mAb was then tested for its specificity by indirect
immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blot analysis.

HCT116-luc2 Bioware Ultra cell line, obtained
from Caliper Life Sciences, Inc. (Hopkinton, MA), was
established by using HCT116 human adenocarcinoma
cells (ATCC, CCL-247T) stably transduced with lentivirus
containing luciferase 2 gene under the control of human
ubiquitin C promoter (pGL4 luc2). 1 x 106 HCT116-luc2
cancer cells were injected into tail veins of 8-week old
nude mice. Antibody was then injected into ‘treated’ mice
via tail veins on day 3, follow by two antibody injections
per week. After 7-week treatment, purified PRL-3 antibody
(by protein G/A bead) was labeled using a CF750 Dye
Antibody Labeling Kit from Caliper Life Sciences, Inc.
(Hopkinton, MA). Labeled antibodies were injected via
tail vein 1 hr before live imaging. Mice are injected by an
intraperitoneal route with a luciferin solution (200 x stock
solution 30 mg/ml in PBS, dose of 150 mg/kg) that is
allowed to distribute in conscious animals for about 5-15
minutes. The mice were then placed into a clear plexiglass
anesthesia box (supplied with 2.5-3.5% isofluorane) that
allows unimpeded visual monitoring of the animals using
IVIS® Spectrum Imaging System 3D Series to track and
monitor tumor development in vivo. The results between
‘treated’ verse ‘untreated’ mice were determined.

Cell lines and cell culture
HCT116 (CCL-247) human colorectal carcinoma
cell line, NCI-H460 (HTB-177) human non-small lung
cancer cell line, A431 (CRL-1555) human epidermoid
carcinoma cell line, B16F0 (CRL-6322), and B16F10
(CRL-6475) mouse melanoma cell lines were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC,
Manassas, VA). A2780 (Cat #93112519) human ovarian
cancer cell line was purchased from ECACC, UK. Cells
were grown in appropriate media recommended by the
suppliers.

Western blot analysis
Generation of mouse PRL-3 monoclonal antibody
and Western blot procedures have been described
previously [17]. GAPDH antibody was from Millipore
(Bedford, MA). Donkey anti-human HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody (Cat #709035149) was obtained from
Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Baltimore,
PA).

FACS analysis

Experimental Metastatic Assay in mice [20]

The human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431
was grown in DMEM with high glucose (4.5g/L),
supplemented with 10% FBS and 5% antibiotic. B16F0
and B16F10 cells were grown in RPMI, supplemented
with 10% FBS and 5% antibiotics. Cells (5 x 106) were
dislodged from the dishes with non-enzymatic prewarmed cell dissociation solution (Sigma, Cat #c-5914)
and transferred to 5 ml polystyrene tubes and washed once
with complete medium. The cells were then incubated with
1 µl EGFR (Genetech, USA) or 5 µl PRL-3 mouse primary
antibodies in 100 µl of complete medium for 1 h at room
temperature (RT). Cells were agitated every 15 minutes
to prevent clumping. Cells were then washed twice with
complete medium and incubated for 1 h at RT with goat
anti-mouse AlexaFluor 546 antibody (Invitrogen, USA),
washed, and re-suspended in 1 ml complete medium
prior to analysis using BD FACS Caliber. Raw data was
processed using WinMDI ver2.8 software.

1 x 106 cancer cells were injected into the circulation
of eight-week old nude mice (Jackson Labs, USA) via the
tail vein on day 1. Chimeric PRL-3 mAbs (h318) or mouse
PRL-3 mAbs (m318) were subsequently injected into the
tail vein, with the first antibody administration was carried
on day 3 post-cancer cell injection (the latest time we can
delay for treatment), followed by two administrations per
week. For control untreated group, PBS was administrated
via tail vein. All animal studies were approved by the
Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Institute of
Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB), in strict compliance
with rules and policies of the Animal Facility Center of
The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*
STAR), Singapore.
