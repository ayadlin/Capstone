Abstract
Platinum and PARP inhibitor (PARPi) sensitivity commonly
coexist in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) due to the high
prevalence of alterations in the homologous recombination
(HR) DNA repair pathway that confer sensitivity to both drugs.
In this report, we describe a unique subset of EOC with
alterations in another DNA repair pathway, the nucleotide
excision repair (NER) pathway, which may exhibit a discordance in sensitivities to these drugs. Speciﬁcally, 8% of highgrade serous EOC from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset
exhibited NER alterations, including nonsynonymous or splice
site mutations and homozygous deletions of NER genes.
Tumors with NER alterations were associated with improved
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), compared with patients without NER alterations or BRCA1/2 muta-

tions. Furthermore, patients with tumors with NER alterations
had similar OS and PFS as BRCA1/2-mutated patients, suggesting that NER pathway inactivation in EOC conferred enhanced
platinum sensitivity, similar to BRCA1/2-mutated tumors.
Moreover, two NER mutations (ERCC6-Q524 and ERCC4A583T), identiﬁed in the two most platinum-sensitive tumors,
were functionally associated with platinum sensitivity in vitro.
Importantly, neither NER alteration affected HR or conferred
sensitivity to PARPi or other double-strand break–inducing
agents. Overall, our ﬁndings reveal a new mechanism of platinum sensitivity in EOC that, unlike defective HR, may lead to a
discordance in sensitivity to platinum and PARPi, with potential implications for previously reported and ongoing PARPi
trials in this disease. Cancer Res; 75(4); 628–34. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

inhibitors of PARP inhibitor (PARPi), a novel class of anticancer
agents, which exhibit synthetic lethality in tumors with a defective
HR pathway (4, 5).
Although defective HR is an important mediator of platinum
sensitivity in EOC, repair of platinum-induced DNA damage does
not involve only the HR pathway. The nucleotide excision repair
(NER) pathway is a highly conserved and remarkably versatile
DNA repair pathway that functions to identify and repair bulky
DNA cross-links generated by a variety of genotoxic agents including platinum (6). Indeed, more than 90% of platinum–DNA
lesions are intrastrand cross-links, which are repaired by the NER
pathway (6–8). Furthermore, biallelic germline mutations of NER
pathway genes lead to extreme platinum sensitivity observed in
patients with Xeroderma pigmentosum or Cockayne syndrome
(9, 10).
Defective HR contributes to sensitivity to both platinum and
PARPi, explaining why responsiveness to PARPi is closely associated with platinum sensitivity in EOC (11). In fact, completed
and on-going clinical trials of PARPi routinely enroll patients with
platinum-sensitive disease in an attempt to enrich for HR-defective tumors that are likely to respond to PARPi (12). However,
platinum and PARPi sensitivity do not always coexist in EOC.
Speciﬁcally, not all platinum-sensitive tumors respond to PARPi
(11), and EOC tumors that become PARPi-resistant retain the
potential to respond to subsequent platinum-based chemotherapy (13). Understanding the mechanisms of discordance between
platinum and PARPi sensitivity may help optimize the administration of these agents in the clinical management of EOC and
may also aid in the development of novel therapies to overcome
resistance.

Platinum analogues (cisplatin and carboplatin) are active
agents against epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and constitute the
backbone of ﬁrst-line chemotherapy used in this disease (1, 2).
The enhanced platinum sensitivity of EOC tumors is thought to be
related to an underlying defect in homologous repair (HR)–
mediated DNA repair, particularly in those tumors with highgrade serous histology. Speciﬁcally, approximately 50% of the
high-grade serous EOCs in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset harbored genetic or epigenetic alterations involving the
HR pathway, with germline and somatic BRCA1/2 mutations
occurring in 15% and 6% to 7%, respectively (3). Tumors with
defective HR have also been shown to be exquisitely sensitive to

Discordance in Platinum and PARPi Response in Ovarian Cancer

In this study, we show that NER alterations are present in EOC
and that these alterations are associated with a phenotype of
clinical platinum sensitivity that is similar to that of BRCA1/2mutated tumors with improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Moreover, we show that NER alterations are associated with increased cellular platinum sensitivity
and that, unlike defective HR, lead to discordance between
platinum and PARPi sensitivity, a ﬁnding that may have important clinical and translational implications.

Materials and Methods
Evaluation of NER alterations in TCGA dataset
We accessed data for 316 patients with high-grade serous EOCs
in the TCGA dataset for which DNA copy number, promoter
methylation, and whole-exome sequencing information was
available (3, 14, 15). We evaluated for nonsynonymous or splice
site mutations, promoter hypermethylation, and homozygous
deletions in the following NER genes: XPA, XPC, DDB1, ERCC4,
ERCC5, ERCC2, ERCC3, ERCC1, ERCC6, PCNA, ERCC8, LIG1,
RAD23B, MNAT1, MMS19, RFC1, and XAB2. For each NER
mutation, we also evaluated the copy-number status to assess
whether it was accompanied by heterozygous loss. Homozygous
deletion status was determined by GISTIC methodology (as
applied in the ovarian TCGA dataset), and we focused only on
those with concurrent low mRNA expression levels of the corresponding NER gene (i.e., mRNA expression z score of less than
3). Promoter hypermethylation was assessed using the same
criteria described in the ovarian TCGA dataset publication (3).
Cell culture
ERCC6 (GM16095)- and ERCC4 (GM08437)-deﬁcient
immortalized ﬁbroblast cell lines (Coriell Cell Repository) were
cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% FBS, 1%
Penicillin Streptomycin and L-glutamine. ERCC6-deﬁcient line
was complemented with either wild-type or mutant N-terminal
Flag-tagged ERCC6, cloned in a pOZ vector. The ERCC4-deﬁcient
line was complemented with C-terminal Myc-tagged wild-type or
mutant ERCC4, cloned in a pLenti vector (Origene).
For Western blotting, whole cell extracts were prepared by
lysing cells in RIPA with complete protease inhibitor. Lysates
were resolved on a polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a PVDF
membrane, and incubated with primary antibodies [BRCA2
(ab-1; Calbiochem), BRCA1 (ab-1; Calbiochem), ERCC4
(D3G8C; Cell Signaling Technology), ERCC6 (D-7; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), Flag (M2; Sigma), and b-actin (Cell Signaling
Technology)]. Signal was detected using an ECL kit (Pierce)
and visualized with a Fuji LAS-3000 luminescent image analyzer system.
Transfection
Targeted genes were depleted by transient transfection of siRNA
directed against BRCA2 (50 -GAAGAAUGCAGGUUUAAUAdTdT30 ), ERCC4 (ERCC4-5), or ERCC6 (ERCC6-2). All siRNA duplexes
were from Qiagen. siRNA duplexes were transfected at a ﬁnal
concentration of 100 nmol/L using the Lipofectamine Reagent
(Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer0 s recommendations. In all experiments, a fraction of transfected cells was
analyzed by immunoblot to assess knockdown efﬁciency. Transfection of plasmid cDNA was achieved using Lipofectamine LTX
(Life Technologies). Functional assays were performed 48 hours

www.aacrjournals.org

after transfection, and protein expression was concurrently analyzed by immunoblot.
HR efﬁciency
HR efﬁciency was measured using the DR-GFP reporter assay.
Brieﬂy, 48 hours before SceI transfection, U20S-DR-GFP cells were
transfected with Control siRNA or siRNA targeting BRCA2,
ERCC4, or ERCC6. The HR activity was determined by FACS
quantiﬁcation of viable GFP-positive cells 96 hours after SceI
cDNA transfection. For RAD51 immunoﬂuorescence, cells were
ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature, followed by extraction with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 10
minutes on ice. Incubation with the primary antibody (antiRAD51; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was performed at 37 C.
Cell survival assays
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated with increasing
concentrations of cisplatin (Sigma), Doxorubicin (Sigma), and
Rucaparib (AG-014699; Selleckchem). After 72 hours, viability
was assessed 72 hours by adding CellTiter-Glo (Promega) and
measuring luminescence using a luminescence plate reader. Survival at each drug concentration was plotted as a percentage of the
survival in drug-free media.
Statistical analysis
The t test and the Fisher exact test were used to analyze
the clinical and experimental data. Signiﬁcance was deﬁned as
a P < 0.05; all reported P values are two sided. OS and PFS curves
were generated by the Kaplan–Meier method, and statistical signiﬁcance was assessed using the log-rank test. Tumors that harbored
both NER and BRCA1/2 mutations (n ¼ 4) were not included in the
PFS or OS survival analysis. Inclusion of these tumors did not
signiﬁcantly change the results of the PFS and OS analyses

Results and Discussion
NER alterations are present in EOC and are associated with
clinical platinum sensitivity
We curated the EOC TCGA dataset to assess potential inactivating events of the NER pathway, including mutations, homozygous deletions, and promoter hypermethylation of NER genes
(3, 14, 15). We found that a total of 24 (8%) of 316 EOCs
harbored either NER mutations or homozygous deletions of NER
genes. Speciﬁcally, we identiﬁed 19 cases with nonsynonymous or
splice site NER gene mutations (all somatic) and 6 cases with
homozygous deletions of NER genes among the 316 sequenced
EOCs of the TCGA dataset (Fig. 1A). None of the NER genes were
found to harbor promoter hypermethylation. All NER mutations
were mutually exclusive, i.e., no individual tumor harbored
mutations in more than one NER gene. Furthermore, NER mutations were mutually exclusive with homozygous deletions of the
NER genes with the exception of one case that harbored both an
ERCC5 mutation and homozygous deletion of ERCC2. Of the 19
cases with NER mutations, 7 (36.8%) were accompanied by
heterozygous loss of the respective NER gene (Fig. 1A), indicating
that in these cases both wild-type alleles had been lost.
Importantly, patients with tumors with NER alterations exhibited statistically signiﬁcantly higher median OS (63.5 vs. 41.5
months, respectively; log-rank P ¼ 0.048) and a trend toward
statistically signiﬁcantly higher median PFS (30.4 vs. 14.7
months, respectively; log-rank P ¼ 0.069) compared with patients

with tumors without NER alterations and BRCA1/2 mutations
(Fig. 1B and C). Furthermore, patients with tumors with NER
alterations exhibited similar outcome (OS and PFS), with tumors
harboring BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations (Fig. 1B and C).
It is widely accepted that the improved OS and PFS observed in
EOCs with BRCA1/2 mutations are attributed to their enhanced
sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy due to defective HR-mediated DNA repair (16, 17). In this regard, the improved outcome of
EOC tumors with NER alterations, which is similar to that of
tumors that harbor BRCA1/2 mutations, supports the notion that
NER alterations may confer a phenotype of enhanced platinum
sensitivity.
NER alterations are functionally associated with platinum
sensitivity in vitro
As a proof of principle that NER alterations are functionally
associated with platinum sensitivity, we evaluated two NER
mutations (ERCC6-Q524 and ERCC4-A583T) that were identiﬁed in 2 patients (cases 9 and 19, respectively, Fig. 1A) with
advanced-stage high-grade serous EOC that demonstrated the
best response to ﬁrst-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The
ERCC6-Q524 nonsense mutation was present in a patient with
stage IV suboptimally debulked high-grade serous tumor that had
complete response to ﬁrst-line platinum chemotherapy and
remained in complete remission for 31.5 months after diagnosis.
The ERCC4-A583T missense mutation was present in a patient
with stage IIIC optimally debulked high-grade serous tumor who
is alive and disease-free 25 months after diagnosis.
To determine the functional signiﬁcance of ERCC6-Q524 on
platinum sensitivity, we evaluated whether this variant could
rescue platinum sensitivity in an ERCC6-deﬁcient cell line. An
ERCC6-deﬁcient immortalized ﬁbroblast cell line (GM16095)

was complemented with either wild-type ERCC6 or the mutant
ERCC6-Q524 . Expression of wild-type ERCC6 rescued cisplatin
sensitivity of ERCC6-deﬁcient cells, whereas complementation
with mutant ERCC6-Q524 did not impact cisplatin sensitivity
(Fig. 2A). To conﬁrm that ERCC6 loss alone is solely sufﬁcient to
induce cisplatin sensitivity, we assessed cisplatin cytotoxicity
following siRNA knockdown of ERCC6. ERCC6 depletion significantly increased platinum sensitivity, comparable with BRCA2
loss, a major mediator of DNA cross-link repair (Supplementary
Fig. S1A).
Given that ERCC6-Q524 was a somatic mutation and not
associated with heterozygous loss, we evaluated whether this
mutation may exert a dominant-negative effect. We postulated
that ERCC6-Q524 may interfere with the function of the wildtype allele and hence increase sensitivity to cisplatin. Indeed,
introduction of the ERCC6-Q524 variant in ERCC6 wild-type
293T cells dramatically increased cisplatin sensitivity compared
with cells transfected either with wild-type ERCC6 or control
empty vector, suggesting that this mutation sensitizes cells to
cisplatin by a dominant-negative mechanism (Fig. 2B). This
ﬁnding suggests that even in the absence of heterozygous loss,
NER mutations may still be functionally relevant in terms of
platinum sensitivity in EOC. Heterozygous NER mutations associated with platinum sensitivity have been reported in other
tumor types (other than EOC) and more recently in bladder
cancer (18). How mutation of one NER allele can exert a dominant-negative phenotype is unclear and several mechanisms are
possible. First, because NER proteins are assembled into large,
multisubunit complexes, the presence of a mutant protein may
have a deleterious effect on DNA repair, even when the wild-type
protein is present. Alternatively, the mutated protein may bind,
but not adequately repair, damaged DNA, thereby preventing

dominant-negative phenotype as previously described for ERCC2
in yeast (19).
Similarly, we evaluated whether the ERCC4-A583T mutant
could rescue the platinum sensitivity of ERCC4-deﬁcient
(GM08437) cells. Reintroduction of wild-type ERCC4, but not
the mutant protein, was able to rescue cisplatin sensitivity of
ERCC4-deﬁcient cells (Fig. 2C). Importantly, ERCC4-A583T was a

complete loss of functional ERCC4 in this patient. Furthermore,
ERCC4 knockdown alone was able to confer platinum sensitivity
in 293T cells to levels comparable with BRCA2 depletion (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Our experiments indicate that the ERCC4-A583T and ERCC6Q524 mutations confer platinum sensitivity in vitro and may be
responsible for the extreme platinum sensitivity observed in these
2 patients. It is important to underscore that, in both tumors, we
could not detect any concurrent HR pathway alterations that

would otherwise explain the extreme platinum sensitivity of these
patients. Speciﬁcally, there were no BRCA1/2 mutations, epigenetic silencing of BRCA1, mutations in Fanconi Anemia genes,
mutations in core HR RAD genes, mutations in DNA damage
response HR genes, ampliﬁcation of EMSY, and homozygous
deletion of PTEN detected in these tumors. Taken together, our
ﬁndings provide the proof of principle that platinum sensitivity
may occur in EOC as a result of NER alterations.
ERCC6-Q524 and ERCC4-A583T mutations do not affect HR
nor sensitivity to PARPi
We evaluated the association of these NER alterations with
sensitivity to the PARPi rucaparib. Unlike in the case of cisplatin,
expression of wild-type or mutant ERCC6 or ERCC4 did not affect
PARPi sensitivity of ERCC6- and ERCC4-deﬁcient ﬁbroblasts (Fig.
3A). Furthermore, because defective HR is a critical mediator of
platinum and PARPi sensitivity in EOC, we evaluated whether
deﬁciency in ERCC6 or ERCC4 affected HR in vitro. Inhibition of

ERCC4 or ERRC6 did not affect HR efﬁciency in vitro, as measured
by direct-repeat GFP recombination (DR-GFP) assay and by
IR-induced RAD51 foci formation, a surrogate for HR efﬁciency
(Fig. 3B and C). Similarly, reintroduction of wild-type or mutant
ERCC6 or ERCC4 did not affect sensitivity of ERCC6- and ERCC4deﬁcient ﬁbroblasts to the topoisomerase-II inhibitor doxorubicin or the topoisomerase-I inhibitor camptopthecin (Fig. 3D and
Supplementary Fig. S2), which induce DNA double-strand breaks
that are repaired by HR. Together, these results indicate that
functional loss of ERCC6 or ERCC4 does not impair HR efﬁciency
nor alters sensitivity to PARPi or other double-strand break–
inducing agents such as camptothecin and doxorubicin.
Our ﬁndings suggest a novel mechanism of discordance
between platinum and PARPi sensitivity in EOC, which may have
important clinical and translational implications. Platinum sensitivity has been traditionally used as an eligibility criterion for
selection of participation in PARPi clinical trials in an attempt to
enrich for HR-defective tumors that may respond to PARPi (12).

Discordance between platinum and PARPi due to NER alterations: potential implications. A, potential implications of NER alterations for platinum and PARPi
sensitivity in patients with BRCA/HR-proﬁcient (I) and BRCA/HR-deﬁcient (II) tumors. I, if tumors with NER alterations are HR proﬁcient, i.e., they do not harbor
concurrent HR alterations that would confer sensitivity to PARPis, they are expected to be platinum sensitive but not PARPi sensitive. II, if tumors with NER
alterations are BRCA/HR deﬁcient they will initially be sensitive to both platinum and PARPis. However, if these tumors develop resistance to PARPi via reversion of
the HR defect (e.g., via secondary BRCA1/2 mutations), they are predicted to retain some sensitivity to subsequent platinum therapy due to the underlying NER
–/–
alterations. B, expression of BRCA1 (BRCA1 þ si Ctrl, red solid line) rescues the cisplatin hypersensitivity of BRCA1 MDA-MB-436 cells [empty vector (EV) þ si
ERCC6, black dashed line]. However, BRCA1-restored cells with ERCC6-depletion (BRCA1 þ si ERCC6, red dashed line) partially retain sensitivity to cisplatin
compared with BRCA1-restored line without ERCC6-depletion (BRCA1 þ si Ctrl, red solid line; left plot). Sensitivity is measured by 3-day viability. Error bars,  1
SEM. IC50 values are shown as a measure of the relative cisplatin sensitivity of MDA-MB-436 cell lines (right plot). An immunoblot showing knockdown
efﬁciency of ERCC6 and reexpression of BRCA1 in MDA-MB-436 cells is shown on the right. C, add-back of BRCA1 cDNA (BRCA1 þ si Ctrl, red solid line)
/
MDA-MB-436 cells (EV þ si ERCC6, black dashed line). Concurrent depletion of ERCC6 (BRCA1 þ si ERCC6) in this cell
restores PARPi sensitivity of BRCA1
line does not impact PARPi sensitivity (left plot). Sensitivity is measured by 3-day viability. Error bars,  1 SEM. IC50 values are shown as a measure of the
PARPi sensitivity of MDA-MB-436 cell lines (right).

However, our ﬁndings suggest that for tumors with NER alterations, platinum sensitivity may not always be an accurate predictor of PARPi sensitivity. Speciﬁcally, if tumors with NER alterations are HR proﬁcient, i.e., they do not harbor concurrent HR
alterations that would confer sensitivity to PARPis, platinum
sensitivity may not necessarily translate into PARPi sensitivity
(Fig. 4A). Therefore, the presence of NER alterations may explain
why certain patients with extreme platinum sensitivity who are
enrolled in PARPi trials fail to respond to these agents (11, 12).
Speciﬁcally, in the phase II multicentre, open-label, nonrandomized study of olaparib in women with advanced high-grade
serous and/or undifferentiated ovarian carcinoma (20), the objective response rate to the PARPi olaparib in patients with platinumsensitive ovarian cancer was 50% in BRCA1/2-negative and
60% in BRCA1/2-mutated tumors. Furthermore, in the phase I
dose-escalation and single-stage expansion study of olaparib
in BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancer (11), the clinical beneﬁt
response rate (radiologic or tumor marker complete or partial
response or radiologic disease stabilization for 4 months or more)
was 69% in patients with platinum-sensitive disease. Overall, as
evident by these studies, 30% to 50% of tumors with platinumsensitive ovarian cancer were resistant to PARPi therapy.

Furthermore, NER alterations may also, at least partly, explain
another phenomenon, commonly encountered in clinic, whereby
certain patients with BRCA1/2-mutated tumors that become
PARPi-resistant retain the potential to respond to subsequent
platinum-based chemotherapy, as has been previously reported
(13). It is well known that the most common mechanism of
PARPi resistance in BRCA/HR-deﬁcient tumors is reversion of the
HR defect (i.e., secondary BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations restoring
normal BRCA1/2 function; refs. 21–23). In this regard, if BRCA/
HR-deﬁcient tumors also harbor NER alterations, then reversion
of the HR defect conferring PARPi resistance (21, 22) will not
confer cross-resistance to platinum; therefore, these patients may
still beneﬁt from subsequent platinum-based therapy (Fig. 4A).
Supporting this, restoration of BRCA1 function in BRCA1- and
ERCC6-depleted cells completely rescues PARPi sensitivity but
only partially rescues cisplatin sensitivity (Fig. 4B and C). In this
regard, in a retrospective review of patients with BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancer who received chemotherapy following disease
progression on olaparib (i.e., after development of resistance to
PARPis), response to platinum-based chemotherapy was 40%,
thereby suggesting a discordance between platinum and PARPi
sensitivity of 40% in this setting (13). Known mechanisms of

resistance to PARPis in patients with BRCA1/2-mutated EOCs or
EOCs with BRCAness phenotype (apart from secondary BRCA1/2
mutations) include loss of PARP1 expression, upregulation of Pglycoprotein efﬂux Pump transporter, and loss of 53BP1 in
BRCA1 mutant cells. Of these mechanisms, loss of 53BP1 has
been experimentally proven to confer platinum sensitivity in
BRCA1-mutated tumors (24), but its exact clinical relevance in
patients with ovarian cancer is unclear.
In conclusion, we report for the ﬁrst time that NER pathway
alterations (mutations and homozygous deletions) occur in EOC
and that these alterations are associated with a phenotype of
clinical platinum sensitivity that is similar to that of BRCA1/2mutated tumors characterized by improved OS and PFS. We
showed that the NER mutations identiﬁed in the most platinum-sensitive tumors (ERCC6-Q524 and ERCC4-A583T) were
functionally associated with platinum sensitivity in vitro. Importantly, these NER alterations did not affect HR and did not confer
sensitivity to PARPi, thus providing a novel mechanism of discordance between platinum and PARPi sensitivity in EOC. Our
ﬁndings suggest that NER alterations may have a previously
unrecognized role as biomarkers for selection of patients for
participation in PARPi trials as well as for deciding therapy after
development of PARPi resistance.
