ABSTRACT
Emerging evidence indicates that Retinoic acid receptor-β (RARβ) is a tumor
suppressor in many types of tumor. However, whether or not RARβ is a risk factor and is
correlated to clinicopathological characteristics of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
remains unclear. In this report, we performed a meta-analysis to determine the
effects of RARβ hypermethylation on the incidence of NSCLC and clinicopathological
characteristics in human NSCLC patients. Final valuation and analysis of 1780 cancer
patients from 16 eligible studies was performed. RARβ hypermethylation was found
to be significantly higher in NSCLC than in normal lung tissue, the pooled OR from 7
studies including 646 NSCLC and 580 normal lung tissues, OR = 6.05, 95% CI = 3.5610.25, p<0.00001. RARβ hypermethylation was significantly higher in adenocarcinoma
(AC) compared to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), pooled OR is 0.68 (95% CI =
0.52-0.89, p = 0.005). RARβ hypermethylation was also found to occur significantly
higher in smoker (n = 232) than non-smoker (n = 213) (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.543.93, p = 0.0002). Our results indicate that RARβ hypermethylation correlates well
with an increased risk in NSCLC patients. RARβ gene inactivation caused by RARβ
methylation contributes the NSCLC tumorigenesis and may serve as a potential risk
factor, diagnostic marker and drug target of NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION

Retinoic acid (RA) and its derivative, retinoid can
bind its three retinoic acid receptors (RAR), RARα, RARβ
and RARγ, are required for normal lung development [69]. Previous reports showed that RARβ was frequently
epigenetically silenced in tumor progression, which
demonstrated that RARβ belongs to a tumor suppressor
protein [10-12]. RARβ gene mutation was not reported
in NSCLC. The loss of coactivators, such as AF2 coactivators of the RAR-Thyroid Hormone Receptor
complex are often lost in human lung cancer and the loss of
AF-2 cofactors results in low levels of transcribed RARβ
[13]. Silencing RARβ by promoter hypermethylation has
been found as one mechanism that regulates alveolar and
epithelial differentiation and lung tumorigenesis [1415]. The hypermethylation of RARβ in NSCLC has been
reported inconsistently [16-17], although some groups
indeed found that the inactivation of the RARβ is caused by
epigenetic progression, hypermethylation of RARβ gene in
NSCLC [16-17]. In addition, it is not clear whether RARβ

Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) consists of
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenocarcinoma (AC),
large cell carcinoma and others. There are approximately
80% of NSCLC cases in later stage where the treatment
and prognosis is far from satisfactory [1]. Thus,
identification of the risk factors and diagnostic markers
is still needed for the prevention and the diagnosis of
NSCLC patients. Epigenetic alterations, particularly
aber­rant DNA methylation, play a crucial role in cancer
formation and progression [2-3]. Hypermethylation of
CpG island in tumor suppressor gene promoter is a wellknown and typical epigenetic changes in cancer [2-4].
Nowadays the assay of gene promoter hypermethylation
has not only been recognized as a remarkable tool for
diagnosis of cancer, but also a prognosis factor to predict
the cancer risk in a variety of cancers including NSCLC
[5].

is associated with any clinical characteristics of NSCLC
and predicts the risk of diseases. The discrepancy of the
published data underpin the necessity to study the role of
RARβ inactivation by gene promoter hypermethylation in
NSCLC. Therefore, we perform an evaluation on the role
of RARβ hypermethylation in lung tumorigenesis using a
quantitative meta-analysis as well as a systematic review.

Korea, Japan, Finland, Australia, and USA was included
and counted 1780 cases. Their demographic information
and clinical parameters are formatted into Table 1.
By determine the RARβ promoter hypermethylation
using lung tissues, the NSCLC patients showed
significantly higher RARβ promter hypermethylation
frequency than those of normal individuals. That is the
RARβ conveyed the positive association for promoter
hypermethylation when comparing NSCLC tumors to
normal controls, with the pooled OR of 6.05 (95% CI
= 3.56-10.25, p < 0.00001) from 7 studies having both
NSCLC tissues (n = 646) and normal lung tissues (n =
580) (Figure 2). To further determine the association of
RARβ hypermethylation and two major pathological
types, SCC and AC, total of 456 of SCC patients and
567 of AC patients in 8 studies were extracted. RARβ
hypermethylation was remarkably higher in AC patients
in comparison to SCC patients with pooled OR of 0.68

RESULTS
Sixteen publications which fitted into the inclusion
criteria were collected into in this study. One hundred and
ninety one publications were not included for the reasons
such as in vivo animal work or in vitro cell culture model,
non-original articles (review and editorial), or irrelevant
publications. Figure 1 shows sixteen studies from 2004 to

(95% CI = 0.52-0.89, p = 0.005) (Figure 3). This result
demonstrates that the hypermethylation RARβ may have
a crucial function in the lung tumorigenesis especially in
AC formation.
After analysis of combining estimates of the OR
from 5 studies of 445 of NSCLC (Figure 4), the rate of
hypermethylation of RARβ was detected significantly
higher in smoker (n = 232) than non-smoker (n = 213) (OR
= 2.46, 95% CI = 1.54-3.93, p = 0.0002). This indicates
that RARβ conveyed the positive association for promoter
hypermethylation when comparing NSCLC smoker and
NSCLC non-smoker.
Finally we removed one study at a time to calculate
the sensitivity which is a sign of the analysis result
stability. Neither the pooled ORs nor HRs were extremely
altered, demonstrating the acceptable stability of the
results. The symmetrical funnel plots as shown in Figure
5A-C imply no publication biases exist in the current
study.

in promoter regions of genes [20-21]. Just similar to
other tumor suppressor genes, the CpG islands of RARβ
promoter are easily hypermethylated in malignant
cells. Gene hypermethylation usually represses its
transcription and plays an important role in the gene
regulation. The RARβ gene expression can cause RAdependent and RA-independent apoptosis and growth
arrest, which is mediated through RARα [22-23]. RARβ
protein results in the expression of a number of its
target genes that mediate cell differentiation and death
[10, 24-25]. RARβ is epigentically altered in many
different kinds of human cancers. Inactivation of RARβ
by promoter hypermethylation contributes significantly
to tumorigenesis of a variety of cancers including
NSCLC [26-32]. Several groups have studied RARβ
methylation status in NSCLC; but the lack of systemic
and quantitative analysis of methylation of RARβ in
NSCLC and its relationship with the clinical parameters
really hampers the appreciation of mechanism of lung
cancer as well as the development of novel tools for
diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC patients. Analysis
of the pooled data showed that there was a higher RARβ
hypermethylation in NSCLC patients when compared to
normal lung tissue, indicating that RARβ hypermethylation
is risk factor in the carcinogenesis of NSCLC. RARβ
hypermethylation was also found to correlated with
pathological types, as well as smoking status. Our
findings that NSCLC patients have high frequencies

DISCUSSION
DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism
that carried out by specific enzymes, the DNA
methyltransferase enzymes [18-19]. In Eucaryotes, only
cytosine belonging to CG dinucleotides, also named
CpG in the 5′ position can be methylated, leading to
the formation of 5-methylcytosine and are distributed

MATERIALS AND METHODS

of RARβ gene promoter methylation compared to the
normal lung tissues, indicating that the detection of RARβ
hypermethylation may provide a practical diagnostic
marker for NSCLC patients. Unlike genetic changes,
the reversible epigenetic modifications in RARβ gene by
methylation can be demethylated and therefore would be
pratical to inhibit or delay carcinogenesis. Epigenetically
silenced RARβ has been shown to be re-expressed in the
presence of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and
DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMT) inhibitors
in RARβ2 silent cancer cells [33]. Treatment with 9-cis
RA and an HDAC inhibitor showed effective in a cancer
xenografts [34]. Four lung tumor lines treated with 5-aza2’-deoxycytidine, restored RARβ expression and resulted
in decreased tumorigenicity [15]. In addition, curcumin
can increase RARβ expression at the mRNA and protein
levels in lung cancer A549 and H460 cells, indicating that
curcumin is able to inhibit RARβ promoter methylation
[35]. The clinical trials have shown the therapeutic
potential by reactivation of tumor suppressor expression
and may shed light on cancer treat­ment through genetargeted therapy.
A number of studies detected and compared the
different rate of RARβ hypermethylation; however,
the results were contradictory due to limited number
of patients from AC and SCC [36-37]. The combining
estimates of the odds ratio from 8 publication having 456
SCC and 567 AC is OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.52-0.89, p =
0.005, which shows the rate of RARβ hypermethylation
was higher in AC than in SCC. In addition, studies have
also reported a correlation between DNA methylation and
tobacco carcinogens [38-42]. The combining estimates of
the odds ratio from 5 studies having 232 and 213 NSCLC
with and without smoking history is OR = 2.46, 95% CI
= 1.54-3.93, p = 0.0002, shows RARβ hypermethylation
significantly increased in smoking NSCLC patients
compared to non-smoking NSCLC.
Publication bias did not exist after sensitivity
analyses. However the study has several potential
restrictions for some reasons. The language was limited
to articles published in English. Publications in other
languages were exluded due to unavailability of accurate
medical translation. In addition, the selection biases could
be possibly existed due to observational studies. Cancer
cells may silence or repress RARβ by mechanisms other
than hypermethylation in NSCLC in order to initiate
and promote their growth and resist treatment with RA.
Therefore, cautions should be taken when our results are
extrapolated to the general populations.
Taken together, our analysis showed a higher RARβ
hypermethylation in NSCLC than normal lung tissues,
higher in AC than in SCC, and higher in smokers than
in non-smokers. RARβ promoter hypermethylation, which
inactivated RARβ gene, may significantly contribute to
the carcinogenesis and serve as a potential drug target and
diagnostic marker for NSCLC patients.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The database of Pubmed, Embase, and ISI web
of knowledge were searched for publications from May
1, 1998 to December 2015 by the key words: “lung”
and “cancer or tumor or neoplasm or carcinoma”,
“methylation”, and “RARβ or retinoic acid receptor-β or
NR1B2”. In addition, the author bibliographies were also
searched manually from the retrieved publications for
additional papers.
After withdraw of irrelevant and/or repeated
publications from various resources, the remaining papers
in the full text were evaluated for selection according
to inclusion and exclusion criteria. All searched papers
were retrieved. The cited references of selected studies
were also determined for other relevant studies. Only one
complete study was selected if same patient populations
were repeatedly reported.
The inclusion criteria for eligibility include: (1)
RARβ hypermethylation was determined in the lung
tissues of primary NSCLC patients, (2) RARβ promoter
hypermethylation was detected by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), (3) the data provided the information
on both status of RARβ hypermethylation as well as
clinicopathological indexes of the NSCLC patients (4) the
statistic information was given such as individual hazard
ratio (HR) of overall survival (OS) and 95 % confidence
interval (CI). However, the Letters, reviews, case reports,
conference abstracts, editorials, expert opinion, and all
research which are involved in vitro/ex vivo studies were
not included.

Extraction methods
We reviewed the following information in each
eligible study, authorship, time of publication, sample
collection, case numbers, clinicopathological information,
the techniques used to calculate gene promoter
methylation, methylation frequences and/or gene product
expression, and the process of follow-up. Disagreements
between the analyzers were fully discussed until come to
an agreement. Demographic data and clinical responses
were formatted into a table. Heterogeneity of study was
calculated to determine if the dataset were suitable for a
meta-analysis.
The methodology of each study was evaluated and
scored based on the REMARK and ELCWP guidelines
[43-44].

Analysis was performed by the softwares of
STATA 12.0 (Stata Corporation, TX, USA) and Review
Manager 5.2 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). The
pooled ratios of RARβ promoter hypermethylation and
95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. The
frequency of RARβ hypermethylation was analyzed and
correlated to various tumor phenotypes. Heterogeneity
among studies was calculated by Cochran’s Q test [45]
which showed by the I2[46-47]. When heterogeneity did
not exist (I2 values < 50%), a fixed effect model was
utilized. On the contrary, a random-effects model was
utilized to pool individual data together. In addition,
potential sources of heterogeneity were identified
by further subgroup analyses. The existence of an
association between RARβ promoter hypermethylation and
clinicopathological indexes were determined by a pooled
OR. P values less than 0.05 was considered significant
level.
Publication bias was assessed by using a method
reported by Egger et al [48]. We also explored reasons for
statistical heterogeneity using meta-regression, subgroup
analysis, and sensitivity analysis. The analysis of metaregression and publication bias were performed by using
STATA version 10.0.
