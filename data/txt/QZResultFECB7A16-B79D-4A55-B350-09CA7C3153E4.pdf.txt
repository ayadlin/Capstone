n this issue of Cancer, the French Immunotherapy Intergroup1
reports results of the PERCY Quattro trial, which compares medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), subcutaneous interferon-alpha
(INF-a), subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2 ), or a combination of the
2 cytokines for front-line treatment of patients with intermediate
prognosis metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Between January
2000 and July 2004, 492 patients were accrued to this trial. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival. Secondary endpoints
included disease-free survival, response rate, toxicity, and quality of
life. No signiﬁcant survival differences were seen between the INF-a
and non–INF-a treated patients (15.4 vs 15.1 months; hazard ratio
[HR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.81–1.24; log rank, 0.99) or between the IL-2
and non–IL-2 treated patients (15.7 vs 14.9 months; HR, 1.07; 95%
CI, 0.87–1.33; log rank, 0.52). However, grade 3–4 toxicities were signiﬁcantly more frequent in patients treated with cytokine.
The authors should be commended. Overall this was a well
designed, large (n ¼ 492), multi-institutional (44 centers) trial by a
highly experienced group of investigators. Few criticisms can be
made of the overall conduct and report of the trial. However, the
question of how results of this trial become current treatment
options for metastatic RCC must be asked. Our ability to pose this
question is refreshing, as it is a sign the times are ﬁnally changing.
Metastatic RCC has long been recognized to be resistant to
chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Observation of spontaneous
remissions in prospective trials with observation or placebo arms
and after nephrectomy led to recognition of the importance of
immune regulation in RCC and, subsequently, to an era of cytokine
therapy including IL-2 and IFN as single agents and as combination
therapy.2
Initial phase 2 trials of high-dose IL-2 showed promising
response rates with reports of complete responses. A landmark trial
published by Fyfe and colleagues3,4 reporting on 255 patients treated with high-dose IL-2 from 7 phase 2 trials with response rates of
14%, including 12 complete responses and 24 partial responses,
many of which were durable (median response of more than 80
months for complete responders), led to approval of high-dose
bolus IL-2 by the United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). This approval was based on small numbers of complete but

durable responses observed in clinical trials.3,4 Toxicities encountered during high-dose IL-2 treatment,
with beneﬁt to only a small proportion of patients,
led to investigation of lower doses and alternative
routes of administration.5–8 Initial phase 2 trials
showed comparative response rates with less toxicity.
However, in randomized clinical trials, fewer, less
durable responses were seen while most patients still
experienced signiﬁcant toxicity.8,9 Addition of IFN to
low-dose IL-2 also did not result in the durable complete responses that had been observed with highdose IL-2.10 Overall, with cytokine therapy, clinical
beneﬁt was modest with response rates of 12% to
15%, progression-free survival of 4.7months, and
overall survival of 12 months.2
At the time the current trial was initiated, no
systemic therapy was considered standard care for
treatment of metastatic RCC given lack of proven
increase in overall survival in any large randomized
therapeutic trial. Since initiation of the currently discussed trial, there has been an increase in understanding molecular pathways associated with the
malignant phenotype of metastatic RCC leading to a
change in treatment to that of targeted therapy. The
hallmark of sporadic clear cell carcinoma is the inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor-suppressor gene resulting in over-expression of hypoxiainducible factor (HIF). Downstream effects of HIF
over-expression include expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF).11
Proof of the principle of targeting the VHL/HIF/
VEGF pathway was ﬁrst demonstrated in a randomized, double-blind, phase 2 trial that compared
bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif ) at doses of 3 and 10 mg per kilogram
with placebo.12 The primary endpoints of the trial
were time to progression and response rates. A modest response rate of 10% was observed, but at the
time of second interim analysis, a statistically signiﬁcant increase in progression-free survival was
observed in the high-dose bevacizumab arm (4.8
months vs 2.5 months; P , .001). There were no signiﬁcant differences in overall survival between
groups. However, this trial conﬁrmed that inhibiting
VEGF could change the natural history of the disease
and, therefore, prompted further investigation of
other agents known to inhibit the VEGF pathway.

Sorafenib
Sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer, West Haven, Conn) is an
orally bioavailable multitargeted serinethreonine/tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of VEGF receptors
(VEGFR) VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3; PDGF

2367

receptor; fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt-3); c-KIT;
and the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. In a randomized phase 2 discontinuation trial of sorafenib
versus placebo in patients with disease refractory to
cytokine, progression-free survival (primary endpoint) was signiﬁcantly longer in the sorafenib arm
at 12 weeks (24 weeks vs 6 weeks; P ¼ .0087).13 The
results of this trial led to a phase 3 randomized, placebo controlled, blinded trial of sorafenib versus placebo in the same patient population.14 A planned
interim analysis demonstrated a signiﬁcant increase
in progression-free survival for patients who received
sorafenib (24 weeks vs 12 weeks; P , .000001) with a
trend toward increased survival favoring sorafenib
(not reached vs 14.7 months; HR, 0.72; P ¼ .018). At
this time, the trial was unblinded, and crossover was
permitted. On the basis of these results, sorafenib
was approved by the FDA in December of 2005 for
treatment of metastatic RCC. At 6 months after
crossover, the trend toward improved overall survival
persisted (19.3 months vs 15.9 months; HR, 0.77;
P ¼ .015). However, the ﬁnal survival analysis
(recently reported at the 2007 American Society of
Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting with 48% of
patients originally treated on the placebo arms crossing over) did not show a signiﬁcant improvement in
overall survival (17.8 months vs 15.2 months; HR,
0.88; P ¼ .148) with a confounding effect of crossover
likely.15

Sunitinib
Sunitinib (Sutent; Pﬁzer, New York, NY) is an oral,
multitargeted TKI of VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and
VEGFR-3; PDGF-a receptor and PDGF-b receptor;
stem cell-receptor factor (KIT); and Flt3 known to inhibit angiogenesis. Sunitinib also exerts direct antitumor activity on cells that express target RTKs
associated with tumor-cell proliferation, such as KIT,
PDGFR, and RET. Sunitinib was granted FDA approval for the treatment of metastatic RCC on the
basis of objective response rates of 34% to 40%16,17
observed in 2 sequential phase 2 studies (compared
with historical response rates of , 5% to second-line
cytokine therapy) in patients with cytokine-refractory
disease. The activity of sunitinib was conﬁrmed in a
phase 3 trial in which sunitinib was compared with
INF-a for frontline treatment of metastatic RCC.18
The median progression-free survival was signiﬁcantly longer in the sunitinib arm (11 months vs 5
months; P , .001). Sunitinib was also associated with
a higher objective response rate (31% vs.6%;
P , .001). Interim overall survival analysis was not
signiﬁcant, but results remain immature, and ﬁnal
overall survival analysis is awaited. This trial has

2368

established sunitinib as a new reference standard for
frontline treatment of metastatic RCC in patients not
eligible for high-dose IL-2 treatment.

Temsirolimus
Temsirolimus (Torisel; Wyeth, Madison, NJ) is an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) kinase, a component of intracellular signaling pathways involved in the growth and proliferation of cells and response to hypoxic stress.19
Disruption of mTOR signaling suppresses production
of proteins that regulate progression through the cell
cycle and angiogenesis.19 Efﬁcacy of temsirolimus in
treatment of metastatic RCC was recently demonstrated in a phase 3 trial that compared temsirolimus, INF-a, and combination temsirolimus with
INF-a in previously untreated, poor-prognosis
patients.19 The primary endpoint was overall survival
with secondary endpoints of progression-free survival, response rate, and clinical beneﬁt deﬁned as
the proportion of patients without progression for at
least 24 weeks. At the time of the second interim
analysis, conducted after 446 patients had died, a
survival beneﬁt was demonstrated for patients in the
temsirolimus alone arm (HR, 0.73; P ¼ .008). Median
overall survival for treatment with interferon, temsirolimus, and combination therapy was 7.3, 10.9, and
8.4 months, respectively. There was also a progression-free survival beneﬁt for patients treated with
temsirolimus alone (5.5 months; P , .001) compared
with 3.1 months with interferon and 4.7 months with
combination therapy. Objective response rates of
4.8%, 8.6%, and 8.1% among patients who received
interferon, temsirolimus, and combination therapy,
respectively, did not differ signiﬁcantly. However, the
proportion of patients without progression for at
least 24 weeks was greater with temsirolimus treatment (32.1%) and combination therapy (28.1%) than
with interferon (15.5%). Results of this trial led to
recent FDA approval of temsirolimus for treatment
of metastatic RCC.
Cytokine Therapy: An Historical Standard
With the approval of 3 new agents by the FDA for
treatment of metastatic RCC over the last 1.5 years
(sorafenib, sunitinib, and temsirolimus), can cytokine
therapy now be relegated to medical history? As further supported by results of this recent trial and
others, there is no clinical beneﬁt associated with
single-agent INF-a treatment or low-dose IL-2 regimens. We argue that the only remaining role for
cytokine therapy alone is with high-dose IL-2 in a
highly select group of patients who have the potential to achieve a durable complete response. Signiﬁ-

cant toxicity for this small, but important, potential
beneﬁt necessitates careful selection of patients.
Ongoing efforts to further deﬁne the subset of
patients with clear cell carcinoma who will beneﬁt
from high-dose IL-2 are important.20,21

Current Dilemma
With change come more questions. With FDA approval of sorafenib, sunitinib, and temsirolimus for
treatment of metastatic RCC, it has become clear
that interferon is no longer a valid reference standard. However, in what order to use the above agents
and whether to use them in combination or sequentially remain undeﬁned. We also do not know if the
doses and schedules currently being used are optimal. As newer targeted agents are developed, it is
currently unclear how best they should be tested.
Should they be third-line therapy or beyond? Considering the number of agents and potential combinations, are large, randomized phase 3 trials the best
use of resources, or are randomized smaller phase 2
trials adequate? What endpoints should we choose?
Is progression-free survival a valid endpoint, or is
the more traditional endpoint of overall survival
more important? If so, will we be able to show survival beneﬁts with crossover designs and availability
of sequential therapy, or will results be confounded?
Temsirolimus has shown a survival beneﬁt but in a
poor-prognosis group of patients who otherwise had
short life-expectancies and who were likely ineligible
for treatment with other targeted agents. We also do
not know what duration of therapy is needed for
patients who do beneﬁt from treatment with these
agents. Is continuous drug exposure required, or will
patients be able to have drug-free periods?
In conclusion, over the last several years, tremendous advances have been made in the treatment
of metastatic RCC. However, many new questions
have resulted. It is a sign that, at last, the times are
a-changin’.
