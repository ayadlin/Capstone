Abstract
Toll-like receptors (TLR) recognize pathogen molecules and danger-associated signals that stimulate
inﬂammatory processes. TLRs have been studied mainly in antigen-presenting cells, where they exert
important immune regulatory functions, but they are also expressed by epithelial tumor cells, where they
have been implicated in tumor progression. In this study, we demonstrate that the injection of TLR7 agonist
in NOD/SCID mice, in C57BL/6 wild-type, and TLR7-deﬁcient mice grafted with lung adenocarcinoma tumor
cells leads to increased tumor progression and chemotherapeutic resistance. In patients with non–small cell
lung cancer, expression analyses revealed that high TLR7 expression was strongly associated with resistance
to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and poor clinical outcomes. Our ﬁndings delineate a crucial role for TLR7 in
lung cancer physiopathology. Cancer Res; 74(18); 5008–18. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The relation between inﬂammation and cancer is well established. Chronic inﬂammation in the tumor microenvironment
promotes tumorigenesis in many cancers. In such an environment, the transcription factors NF-kB and STAT3 have been
found activated in cancer cells (1, 2).
Toll-like receptors (TLR), a family of receptors that recognize
various PAMPs and DAMPs (3), are strongly involved in inﬂammation through the activation of NF-kB. TLRs are expressed by a
numerous immune cells and play a key role in the activation of
dendritic cells, a prerequisite for the induction of speciﬁc
antitumor immune responses (4). Given this property, experimental TLR agonists are currently being investigated in clinical
trials as adjuvants for the treatment of cancers (5–7). Several

studies also demonstrated TLR expression by tumor cells in
many solid cancers (8–14), and their implication in tumor
progression. TLR2 favors gastric tumorigenesis (15), TLR4
promotes the growth and chemoresistance of epithelial ovarian
cancer cells (16), and correlates with tumor grade of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (17). On the contrary, stimulation of TLR3 leads to tumor regression, by inducing apoptosis of
tumor cells (13, 18). More recent studies also demonstrated the
inﬂuence of TLR4 and MyD88 expression on patient's cancer
outcome (19, 20).
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent lung
cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related death
(21). The therapeutic management of patients with NSCLC from
stages I to IIIA, usually consists in surgical resection, often
associated (particularly in stages II–IIIA) with preoperative
and/or postoperative chemotherapy, using platinum-derived
salts combined with a second- or third-generation drug such as
gemcitabine, vironelbine, pemetrexed, or taxanes (22). However, the 5-year survival rate in resected patients remains
low, around 40%, indicating that the treatment is poorly
effective in a high percentage of cases. Indeed, chemoresistance in NSCLC is a well-known phenomenon (22). Several
mechanisms of chemoresistance have been described in
solid cancers, that can be cell-intrinsic (23) or acquired
during the course of the treatment (24). In NSCLC, it has
been shown that galectin 1 expressed by tumor cells induces
chemoresistance through upregulation of p38MAPK and
ERK (25), and that nicotine induces STAT3 phosphorylation,
leading to the serine/threonine kinase IKBKE oncogene
activation, which leads to chemoresistance (26). However,
to date, no biomarker is currently used to predict response
to chemotherapy.

Role of TLR7 in Physiopathology of Lung Cancer

Epidemiologic studies have shown that chronic inﬂammation increases the risk of lung cancer (27, 28). Our
previous investigations demonstrated that TLR7, a receptor
for ssRNA, is expressed by lung cancer cell lines and primary
NSCLC tumor cells and that stimulation of tumor cells with
different TLR7 agonists leads to NF-kB activation, increases
the expression of antiapoptotic molecules, tumor cell survival, and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs including
cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin, and vironelbine (8).
However, TLR7 was not only expressed by tumor cells
because we have also observed its expression by tumorinﬁltrating immune cells (8), some of them located in the
tertiary lymphoid structures that are present in the tumor
stroma of patients with NSCLC (29). In the present study, our
goals were to determine the in vivo consequences of TLR7
stimulation occurring on both tumor and immune cells, on
tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy, and the
impact of TLR7 expression on the clinical outcome of
patients.
We show that stimulation of TLR7 in immunodeﬁcient
and immunocompetent mice grafted with TLR7-positive
tumor cells exerts a protumoral effect and induces resistance to chemotherapy. In large cohorts of surgically treated
patients, receiving or not neoadjuvant chemotherapy, we
demonstrate that high TLR7 expression correlates with poor
prognosis and is associated with lack of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Collectively these results demonstrate a protumoral role of
TLR7 expressed by tumor cells and strongly suggest its implication in the phenomenon of chemoresistance in patients with
NSCLC.

Materials and Methods
Mice
The mouse strains used include NOD/SCID, C57BL/6, and
TLR7-deﬁcient mice (B6.129S1-Tlr7tm1Flv/J strain) and
were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. These mice
were maintained in the Central Animal facilities of the
Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, in standard pathogen-free conditions. Female mice, 6- to 8-week-old, were
used for all experiments. All experiments were performed in
accordance with European Union guidelines, and were
approved by the Charles Darwin Ethics Committee in Animal Experiment, Paris, France (permit number: Ce5/2010/
057).
Cell lines
The human A549 and the murine LL/2 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (respectively, ATCC #CCL-185 and
#CRL-1642). The cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium
(Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS (PAA laboratories GmbH), 1% glutamine, non-essentials amino acids,
1% Ultroser G, 1% HEPES, 1% pyruvate 0.2% Normocin, and
1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere with 5% CO2. The cumulative culture
length of the cells was less than 6 months after resuscitation.

Early passage cells were used for all experiments and they
were not reauthenticated.
Reagents
Human and mouse TLR7 agonist loxoribine (InvivoGen),
which is a guanosine analog, was used at 40 mg for all in vitro
experiments. Human and mouse TLR7 agonist CL264 (InvivoGen), which is a 9-benzyl-8 hydroxyadenine derivative, was
used at 10 mg for in vitro experiments and 40 mg for in vivo
experiments. TLR7 antagonist IRS661 (Euroﬁns, MWG Operon)
or ODN (Euroﬁns) control was used at 20 mg concentration for
in vitro and in vivo experiments. Cisplatin and carboplatin were
obtained from St. Antoine Hospital pharmacy (Paris, France).
In vitro experiments
LL/2 cells (3105) were cultured in a 6-well plate for 48
hours along with TLR7 agonist (10 mg CL264) followed by the
addition of carboplatin (100 mmol/L) for 48 hours. At the end
of the experiment (day 3), the cells were stained by Trypan
blue for counting of live cells. Annexin V and propidium
iodide staining was performed for evaluation of the apoptotic cells.
In vivo experiments
To induce tumor formation, 1  106 cells A549 or LL/2 cells in
PBS were grafted subcutaneously on day 0 into mice. The same
procedure was followed for control mice injected with PBS. Mice
received three intratumoral injections of TLR7 agonist (loxoribine or CL264, 40 mg) and/or IRS661 (20 mg) and ODN (20 mg)
control on days 0, 3, and 6 after grafting of tumor cells followed
by three injections of cisplatin (100 mmol/L) on days 9, 12, and 15.
Tumor growth was measured every 3 or 4 days. The length (l),
breath (b), depth (d) of the subcutaneous tumor in mice were
measured with a caliper and the tumor volume calculated
taking into account all the three values according to the ellipsoid
volume calculation formula: tumor volume ¼ 4/3  p  l/2  b/
2 ¼ 0.5,236  l  b  d.
Flow cytometry
Cells were ﬁxed with Fixation/Permeabilization concentrate
(eBioscience) diluted 1:4 times in Fixation/Permeabilization
diluent and permeabilized using Permeabilization buffer
(eBioscience) diluted 1:10 times in distilled water and 2% human
serum. Cells were stained with polyclonal PE anti-TLR7 (Imgenex) and PE anti-Rabbit IgG isotype control (Jackson Immunoresearch). To identify the intra-tumoral immune cell populations, membrane stainings were performed with PE anti-CD45
(BD Pharmigen), FITC anti-CD3 (BD Pharmigen), PETR antiCD4 (Invitrogen), AF700 anti-CD8 (eBioscience), APC antiCD19 (BD Pharmigen), eF450 anti-CD11b (eBioscience),
PE anti-CD11c (eBioscience), and PerCPcy5.5 anti-Gr1 (BD
Pharmigen). For the FoxP3 analysis, cells are ﬁrst stained with
the cellular antibodies, permeabilized as previously described,
and stained with the primary PE anti-FoxP3 antibody
(eBioscience). Staining was assessed with a FACS Fortessa
cytometer, and ﬂow cytometry data were analyzed using FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences) and FlowJO (Tree Star)
software.

Patients
A retrospective series of 352 NSCLC stage I-III patients
who underwent primary surgery (without neoadjuvant chemotherapy) and who were operated between 2001 and 2005 was
obtained from H^otel-Dieu hospital (Paris, France). A retrospective cohort of 210 stage III NSCLC patients who received
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and who were operated between
2000 and 2007 was obtained from H^
otel-Dieu hospital. Pathologic staging of lung cancer was reviewed and classiﬁed according to the new tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) classiﬁcation
2009 (30), and histologic types were determined according to the
classiﬁcation of the World Health Organization (WHO; ref. 31).
Lung tumor samples were analyzed with the agreement of the
French ethic committee (agreement 2008-133 and 2012 06-12) in
accordance with article L.1121-1 of French law.
IHC and quantiﬁcation of TLR7-positive tumor cells
Tumor samples were ﬁxed in neutral-buffered 10% formalin
solution and parafﬁn embedded. TLR7 staining was performed
as previously described (8) using TLR7-speciﬁc polyclonal
antibody (ENZO Lifesciences) at 10 mg/mL. Positive staining
was identiﬁed as a clear red perinuclear staining of the tumor
cells. The expression level of TLR7 for each patient was determined as the average percentage of TLR7 expression by tumor
cells for 10 ﬁelds at 20 magniﬁcation under a light microscope
(Nikon eclipse, 80i), by three independent readers (S. Chatterjee,
D. Damotte, and I. Cremer), one of them being a pathologist (D.
Damotte).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis for in vivo experiments was performed
using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software) and using the R
software (RFoundation for Statistical Computing; www.r-project.org). All mice experiments were analyzed using ANCOVA
method (P > 0.001 for all parameters tested including tumor
growth over time, tumor growth in different groups of mice, and
interaction between tumor growth over time in the fourth
groups of mice). Post hoc analysis with Bonferroni corrections
were applied for pair-wise comparisons of tumor growth over
time in different groups of mice. Tumor volumes at the endpoint
of each experiment were compared using a nonparametric
Mann–Whitney test with Bonferroni corrections for pair-wise
comparisons. Mann–Whitney tests were also used to compare
percentages and numbers of immune cells inﬁltrating the
tumors in mice.
Overall survival (OS) curves were estimated by the Kaplan–
Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Survival
comparison was adjusted for either imbalanced or prognostic
baseline covariates using a Cox model. Groups of patients were
obtained using the cutoff at minimal P value. Because the P
values obtained might be overestimated, OS log-rank P values
were corrected using the formula proposed by Altman and
colleagues (32). The OS was deﬁned from the date of the surgery
until the date of death or the last day of the patient's visit to the
hospital. Univariate and multivariate analysis with the Cox
proportional hazards regression model was carried out to
identify possible factors that could inﬂuence the survival of the
patients. Parameters identiﬁed in univariate analysis as possibly

inﬂuencing outcome (P  0.05) were introduced in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model.
Comparisons of the mean and the median TLR7 expression in
tumor cells in responders and nonresponders were performed
using a t test and a Mann–Whitney test, respectively.
A Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used to
compare TLR7 expression in lymph nodes and in primary
tumors for the same patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Correlations were obtained by the Spearman test. All P values
were two tailed.
P  0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant for all
experiments.

Results
TLR7 stimulation favors growth of human A549 tumors in
immunodeﬁcient NOD/SCID mice and induces resistance
to chemotherapy
We grafted human A549 cell lines in NOD/SCID mice and
evidenced TLR7 expression by subcutaneous tumors using IHC
(Fig. 1A). Injections of the TLR7 agonist loxoribine resulted in a
marked increase in tumor volume as compared with control
PBS (Fig. 1B and C). The injection of cisplatin resulted in slower
tumor growth. However, when the mice received a combination
of loxoribine and cisplatin, tumor progression was restored to
control levels, abolishing partially the positive effect of cisplatin
on tumor regression (Fig. 1B and C). We obtained similar results
when mice received vironelbine instead of cisplatin (data not
shown).
To demonstrate that the protumoral effect of the agonist was
mediated by TLR7, we used the IRS661 immunoregulatory RNA
sequence, an antagonist previously described to speciﬁcally
block TLR7-mediated inﬂammation (33). Treatment of A549
cells with IRS661 speciﬁcally resulted in a decrease of TLR7
expression (Fig. 1D), whereas it did not affect the expression of
intracellular TLR3, TLR8, and TLR9 (Supplementary Fig. S1). We
grafted NOD/SCID mice with A549 cells and injected either
loxoribine, IRS661, or control ODN, alone or in combination,
followed or not by cisplatin. We observed a decrease in the
tumor volume in mice injected with loxoribine in combination
with IRS661 compared with mice treated with loxoribine in
combination to control ODN, suggesting an antagonistic effect
conferred by TLR7 blockade (Fig. 1E and 1F). However, we did
not observe any signiﬁcant difference in tumor volume in mice
having received IRS661 alone or control ODN. This result shows
that TLR7 antagonist hasan effect only when coinjected with the
agonist. Injection of cisplatin induces a strong reduction of
tumor growth. The injection of IRS661 had no signiﬁcant effect,
injected alone or with cisplatin.
TLR7 stimulation favors growth of murine LL/2 tumors in
immunodeﬁcient NOD/SCID, in immunocompetent
C57BL/6 mice, and in TLR7-deﬁcient mice
We previously demonstrated that some intratumoral
immune cells express TLR7 (8). Therefore, to analyze the effects
of TLR7 stimulation on both tumor and immune cells, we
performed a series of experiments in immunodeﬁcient NOD/
SCID mice, in immunocompetent WT C57BL/6 or in TLR7deﬁcient mice grafted with syngeneic LL/2 cells, which also

experiments, we used CL264, which is a strong agonist for TLR7
in murine tumor cells (data not shown). We ﬁrst demonstrated
that CL264 induces in vitro chemoresistance in murine LL/2
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). We then grafted LL/2 cells in
NOD/SCID mice and conﬁrmed by IHC that subcutaneous
tumors express TLR7 (Fig. 2A). CL264 injections resulted in
increased tumor growth as compared with control PBS (Fig. 2B
and 2C), demonstrating a protumoral effect of TLR7 stimulation. In addition, cisplatin injections induced tumor regression,

resulted in inhibition of tumor growth. However, we observed
no inhibitory effect of cisplatin when the mice had received

fact, the combination of cisplatin with CL264 resulted in
increased tumor growth as compared with control PBS. Similar

the CL264 induced resistance to cisplatin treatment occurred in
wild-type mice having received doses of cisplatin from 100
mmol/L up to 300 mmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S3). We also
injected the TLR7 antagonist IRS661 alone or in combination

than in NOD/SCID mice. The coinjection of CL264 with IRS661
induced a strong decrease in tumor volume, whereas the

Altogether, these results demonstrate that stimulation
of TLR7-expressing tumor cells leads to increased tumor
survival and resistance to chemotherapy, through a direct
effect on tumor cells, and that the coinjection of TLR7
agonist and IRS661 antagonist induces strong reduction of
the tumor.

immune inﬁltrates. The presence of CD45þ immune cells
including T cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, granulocytes, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells was observed in
the tumor microenvironment. The injection of CL264 resulted
in a signiﬁcant increase in the myeloid compartment, whereas
the lymphocyte compartment was not modiﬁed signiﬁcantly.
The injection of CL264 induced an increase in percentages
and absolute numbers of dendritic cells (6%–13%, P ¼ 0.008;
2.34  106–6.9  106 cells, P ¼ 0.016), macrophages (25%–40%, P

(0.69%–1.5%, P ¼ 0.032; 0.017  106–0.048  106 cells,
P ¼ 0.032), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (16.1%–
30.1%, P ¼ 0.008; 0.32  106–0.77  106 cells, P ¼ 0.008) in the
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S5).

High expression of TLR7 on tumor cells is associated with
poor clinical outcome in patients not treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy
To determine the relevance of TLR7 expression in patients
with NSCLC, we quantiﬁed TLR7-expressing tumor cells in a
cohort of 352 untreated patients with stages I to III disease
(Supplementary Table S1). We found a heterogeneity of
TLR7-positive tumor cells among different patients, ranging
from 0% to 100% (Fig. 3A). Twenty seven percent of the
patients had no expression of TLR7 on their tumor cells, and
33% patients had more than 80% of tumor cells expressing
TLR7 (Fig. 3B).
We determined whether such expression of TLR7 on
tumor cells had an impact on the clinical outcome of the
patients. We divided the patients in two groups based on the

method. We found a signiﬁcant worse outcome (P ¼ 0.0021)
among patients who had more than 82% tumor cells expressing TLR7 compared with the patients expressing less than
82% (Fig. 3C). The mean OS was 36 months for the TLR7
>82% group and increased to 72 months for the TLR7 82%
group. Univariate and multivariate proportional hazard Cox
analyses (Table 1) revealed that among parameters tested
(gender, age, smoking history, histologic type, and pathologic stage), the pathologic stage and TLR7 are strong and
independent predictors of survival for resected NSCLC
patients.
High expression of TLR7 on tumor cells is associated with
poor clinical outcome in patients treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and is a marker of
chemoresistance
We quantiﬁed the percentages of TLR7-expressing tumor
cells in a cohort of 210 stage III patients treated with
chemotherapy before the surgery (Supplementary Table
S2). We observed a heterogeneous distribution of TLR7
expression among different patients, ranging from 0% to
100%. Twenty eight percent of the patients had no expression of TLR7 on their tumor cells and 30% patients had more
than 80% of tumor cells expressing TLR7 (Fig. 4A). We also
observed that high TLR7 expression (more than 81% of

tumor cells expressing TLR7 determined as the optimal
cutoff for this cohort, using the minimal P value approach;
Supplementary Fig. S7) confers poor clinical outcome (P ¼
0.0032; Fig. 4B). The mean survival was 17 months for the
TLR7>81% group and increased up to 34 months for the
TLR7 81% group.
Having observed that TLR7 triggering conferred chemoresistance both in vitro and in mice, we searched whether the
percentage of TLR7-expressing tumor cells was associated
with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. At the end of
the treatment, the global response, called "downstaging,"
was estimated by pathologists to determine whether the
tumor had regressed or not in response to chemotherapy.
Among the 166 patients for whom this information was
available, tumor regression was observed only in 55 patients.
These patients, considered as responders, were stage III
before the treatment and stage I or II after chemotherapy.
As expected, the patients for whom no downstaging was
observed have a poor clinical outcome as compared with the
others (Supplementary Fig. S8). We observed strong differences in the mean and the median percentages of TLR7expressing tumor cells when we compared patients who
responded or not to the chemotherapy. The mean of TLR7expressing cells was 27% and 50% for the responders and the
nonresponders, respectively (P ¼ 0.0004) and the median
TLR7 was 3% and 50%, respectively (P ¼ 0.0003; Fig. 4C). In
addition, pathologic examination of the resected lung and
nodal dissection after treatment also allowed the evaluation

of pathologic lymph node and tumor response and assessment of possible downstaging. For few patients (n ¼ 27),
we compared the percentages of TLR7-expressing tumor
cells in the metastatic lymph node and in the primary lung
tumor. We observed a strong positive correlation between
TLR7 expression on tumor cells in lymph node and lung of
the same patient (r2 ¼ 0.5084, P ¼ 0.0009; Supplementary
Fig. S9). Again, a signiﬁcant difference in the percentage of
TLR7-expressing cells was observed in the responders and
the nonresponder patients both in tumor and lymph
node samples (Supplementary Fig. S10). We also showed
signiﬁcant differences in global, tumor, and lymph node
downstaging in patients having more than 81% of tumor
cells expressing TLR7 compared with patients having
less than 81% of TLR7 expression (Supplementary Table
S2). We compared TLR7 expression in responders and

nonresponder patients treated with gemcitabine or with
vironelbine, in combination with cisplatin, and observed
similar levels of mean and median TLR7 expression
among the responders, whatever the type of chemotherapy
(Fig. 5).
We performed univariate and multivariate proportional
hazard Cox analyses on the 166 patients (Table 2). We
observed that in univariate analyses among all clinical
parameters tested, the number of cycles of chemotherapy,
the global downstaging, and the TLR7 expression were
strong predictors of survival for patients with NSCLC. However, in multivariate analyses, tumor TLR7 expression is not
an independent prognostic marker.
Altogether, these results underline a major role for TLR7 in
conferring resistance to chemotherapy consisting of platinum
salt combined with gemcitabine or vironelbine.

Discussion
In the present study, we demonstrated that a high expression
of TLR7 confers poor OS and impacts response to treatment in
patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. To our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that the prognostic and predictive values of TLR7 expression in a large cohort of patients
with NSCLC before and after treatment with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy have been studied.
The strong impact of TLR7 in promoting tumor cell survival
and resistance to treatment has been validated in murine

5016

Cancer Res; 74(18) September 15, 2014

models. Indeed, experiments performed in wild-type or
TLR7-deﬁcient C57BL/6 and in NOD/SCID mice revealed that
injection of TLR7 agonist promoted high tumor growth and
resistance to treatment. Among the mechanisms that could
confer resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, we previously
observed an upregulation of Bcl-2 in lung tumor cell lines
stimulated with TLR7 agonists and also in patients with NSCLC
(8). Our results are in accordance with a link between
chemoresistance and chronic inﬂammation driven by TLR7
stimulation. In vivo, several mechanisms could explain the
protumoral effects of TLR7 agonists, either a direct stimulation
of tumor cell proliferation and/or an indirect effect implying the
stroma, composed of matrix proteins, ﬁbroblasts, and tumorinﬁltrating immune cells. In our study, blocking of TLR7 expression and/or signaling by the inhibitor IRS661 reversed the
protumoral effect of TLR7 agonist in vivo and resulted in
strong inhibition of tumor growth. However, when the
IRS661 antagonist is injected without TLR7 agonist, no
antitumoral effect was observed, which suggests that IRS661
in combination with TLR7 agonists could interfere with
other signaling pathways involved in tumor growth. It could
be hypothesized that the inhibition of TLR7 expression on
tumor cells could downregulate the inﬂammatory processes
involving TLR7 signaling, resulting in inhibition of tumor
growth. Several studies already demonstrated that this
inhibitor strongly reduces local inﬂammation. Indeed it was
showed that IRS661 blocked TLR7-mediated IFNa production by plasmacytoid DC in a systemic lupus erythematous
model (33), and a reduced imiquimiod-induced release of
IL6 and TNFa cytokines by monocytes (34). In addition, it
has been recently shown that inhibition of TLR7 in vivo
is protective against pancreatic tumor progression (35).
Experiments performed in immunocompetent mice revealed
that injection of TLR7 agonist promoted increased tumor
growth and resistance to treatment. Analysis of tumorinﬁltrating immune cells indicated that CL264 treatment
induced a signiﬁcant increase of the myeloid cell compartment, namely dendritic cells, macrophages, and MDSCs,
whereas it had no impact on lymphocyte recruitment.
In the cohort of resected patients not treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the level of TLR7 expression and the
pathologic stage were found to have a signiﬁcant impact on
the outcome of the patients. Multivariate analysis revealed
TLR7 as a strong prognostic marker. Among TLR family members or signaling molecules involved in TLR pathways, TLR4 and
MyD88 have also been shown to be associated with poor
prognosis factors in colorectal (19) and in epithelial ovarian
cancers (20). MyD88 expression in these cancer cells has also
been demonstrated to be a predicting factor of poor response to
paclitaxel chemotherapy (36).
The fact that high tumor TLR7 expression confers poor
clinical outcome to patients suggests that endogenous ligands
are present in the tumor microenvironment. Such ligands could
be DAMPs, such as RNA released from locally dying cells or
miRNA (miR) released the by tumor cells themselves in exosomes. Several sequences of ssRNA have been shown to stimulate human TLR7 in macrophages (37). Moreover, it has been
recently demonstrated that miR-21 and miR-29a present in

exosomes secreted by lung tumor cells trigger TLR7-mediated
inﬂammatory responses (38).
We demonstrated here that TLR7 could also be a predictive
marker for response to chemotherapy. The analysis of pathologic specimens indicates that most of the patients who did not
respond to treatment expressed high levels of TLR7 compared
with the patients who display good response. This observation
strongly suggests that high TLR7 expression confers resistance
to chemotherapy in patients, which is in accordance with the
results from our in vitro and in vivo experiments. No major
difference was found in the expression of TLR7 among the
patients based on the type of chemotherapy administered,
cisplatin plus vironelbine or gemcitabine, suggesting a broad
effect of TLR7 on different chemotherapeutic treatments.
NSCLC is described as highly chemoresistant type of cancer
(22), and several biomarkers conferring a resistance in patients
have already been described including DNA-repair enzymes
(39). However, none of them is currently used for patient's
management. Therefore, TLR7 could be a new interesting
prognostic and predictive marker for chemoresistance in
NSCLC.
Interestingly, we observed a good correlation of TLR7
expression on tumor cells present in the metastatic lymph
nodes before and after chemotherapy and in primary tumors
after chemotherapy (data not shown). This suggests that
mediastinal lymph nodes can be used as a representative
sample for TLR7 expression in the primary tumor. Our
results imply that TLR7 can be a useful predictive marker
for the identiﬁcation of patients with high risk of resistance
to treatment. Indeed, we suggest that the level of TLR7
expression on the tumor cells should be taken into consideration before administration of chemotherapy. Thus, our
results bring novelty in the comprehension of mechanisms
conferring resistance to chemotherapy treatment, and could

have a strong clinical application in the therapeutic management of patients with NSCLC.
