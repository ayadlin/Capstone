BACKGROUND: The results of an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled study assessing the
efficacy and safety of lenalidomide treatment in patients with refractory stage IV metastatic malignant melanoma are
reported. METHODS: The study compared treatment with lenalidomide (25 mg/d on Days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle) to
placebo in 306 patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. Treatment was continued until progression of disease
or unacceptable toxicity. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between lenalidomide and placebo in overall
survival (median 5.9 months vs 7.4 months, respectively; P ¼ .32), time to progression (median 3.0 months vs 2.1
months; P ¼ .19), or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors tumor response (5.3% vs 5.8%; P ¼ .82). None of the
patients given placebo discontinued treatment because of treatment-related adverse events, compared with 4.6% of
those treated with lenalidomide. Treatment-related myelosuppression was observed in 2.0% of patients treated with
placebo and 7.3% of patients treated with lenalidomide. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that treatment with lenalidomide (25 mg/d) has a manageable safety profile in patients with previously treated metastatic malignant melanoma but no benefit in tumor response, time to progression, or overall survival in these patients. Future trials for
treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma with lenalidomide should focus on its use in combination therapies.

Melanoma is a cancer that originates from melanocytes in the skin, which are responsible for skin and hair pigmentation. In 2002, according to statistics from the GLOBOCAN database, 160,177 people worldwide (79,043 men and
81,134 women) were diagnosed with melanoma, and 40,781 died from the disease.1
The Melanoma Staging Committee of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has developed a staging
system that categorizes patients according to their clinical and pathological characteristics.2 In its early stages, melanoma
has a high curative rate, predominantly by surgical resection; however, once it has metastasized, melanoma is extraordinarily resistant to currently available therapies, and patients have a poor prognosis.3,4 Malignant melanoma patients who are
free of disease but have a high risk for systemic recurrence can be treated with interferon (IFN)-a2b, a US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved postsurgical adjuvant therapy that prolongs disease-free survival.4,5
In the AJCC staging system, evidence of distant metastases indicates a stage IV disease classification.2 Median survival of patients with stage IV disease is <9 months, and only a minority of them survive beyond 12 months.2,4 At present,
the only FDA-approved treatments for stage IV metastatic malignant melanoma are dacarbazine and high-dose interleukin (IL)-2.4,6 Although these treatments have exhibited modest tumor response rates, neither treatment provides

significant improvement in overall survival (OS), and IL2 is associated with significant toxicity.4,6 A phase 3 trial
of temozolomide, an oral analogue of dacarbazine,
showed it had comparable efficacy to that of dacarbazine
in advanced metastatic malignant melanoma patients.
Median OS was 7.7 months with temozolomide, which
was equivalent to the 6.4 months seen with dacarbazine,
and hence no significant improvement was seen for
patients in terms of OS.7 Nevertheless, because of its ease
of administration, oral temozolomide treatment is now
generally preferred over intravenous dacarbazine where
funded.4
Other drugs have been tested in clinical trials against
metastatic malignant melanoma, including the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan, the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib, the
angiogenesis inhibitor ABT-510, and the immunomodulatory drug thalidomide.8-14 None of the drugs tested has
had higher response rates than the current treatments with
dacarbazine and IL-2, and to date no treatment has led to
prolonged OS for patients with malignant metastatic melanoma. Thus, despite extensive research efforts, the prognosis of patients with stage IV metastatic malignant
melanoma remains poor, and new treatment regimens are
sought.4 In the United States, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends that patients with
unresectable stage IV metastatic malignant melanoma be
enrolled in clinical trials, either as a first-line therapy or as
a second-line therapy, in preference over other existing
treatments.15
One new compound under investigation for the
treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma is lenalidomide (Revlimid, Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ).
Lenalidomide is an oral drug that has shown antitumor
activity against metastatic malignant melanoma in an animal model.16 Phase 1 studies have demonstrated the safety
and tolerability of lenalidomide and have suggested its
potential for clinical activity in the treatment of metastatic
malignant melanoma.17,18 A phase 2/3 trial (MEL-001)
comparing the efficacy and safety of 2 daily doses of lenalidomide (5 mg vs 25 mg) in the treatment of stage IV metastatic malignant melanoma showed no significant
differences between the doses on response rates or progression-free survival (submitted for publication). This study
demonstrated an acceptable safety profile for lenalidomide used at either dose.
Here, we report the results from the phase 2/3 trial
MEL-002. The objective of MEL-002 was to compare the
efficacy and safety of placebo with 25 mg of lenalidomide,

in the treatment of refractory stage IV metastatic malignant melanoma in patients whose disease had progressed
after treatment with dacarbazine, IL-2, IFN-a, and/or
IFN-b).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
The protocol for this international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was designed
in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined
in the Declaration of Helsinki. Institutional review boards
or ethics committees at each participating center approved
the study protocol. Patients from Australia, Estonia, Germany, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, South
Africa, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom were enrolled
in the study. All patients provided written informed consent. Patients were randomized using an interactive voice
response system. Data from all randomized patients who
received at least 1 dose of study drug were included in the
safety analyses. Response was determined using Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Disease progression
was defined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors criteria. Adverse events were graded
according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.
Patients
Patients aged 18 years with stage IV refractory metastatic malignant melanoma were eligible. Disease stage IV
patients who had relapsed or had refractory disease after
1 to 6 standard metastatic treatments were included.
These patients had previously been treated with therapies
such as dacarbazine, IL-2, IFN-a, and/or IFN-b for stage
IIIb, IIIc, or IV disease. Patients also had to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status score of 2. Patients were excluded from the trial
for concurrent or recent (within past 28 days) cancer treatments, pregnancy, serious mental or physical illness other
than that being treated, human immunodeficiency virus,
hepatitis, hypersensitivity to thalidomide, brain disease,
and previous treatment with lenalidomide. On the basis
of previously published prognostic indicators for metastatic malignant melanoma,19 patients were stratified into
subgroups based on the following variables: sex; ECOG
performance status score; metastatic sites of stage IV melanoma (AJCC stage M1, M2, or M3); serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (normal or elevated); serum

albumin level; alkaline phosphatase level; and platelet
count.
Treatment
Patients were split into 2 arms. Patients in arm A were
treated with placebo administered daily; patients in arm B
were treated with lenalidomide (25 mg) administered
orally for Days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle, and placebo for the
other 7 days. Pill distribution was administered in a double-blind fashion with the same number and pill appearance for all subjects in the study. Concurrent treatment
with filgrastim was recommended for the treatment of
neutropenia, and patients received full supportive care,
including transfusions, antibiotics, and antiemetics when
appropriate. Patients were monitored for adverse events,
with treatment withheld for serious adverse events (grade
3 or higher nonhematological, and grade 4 or higher hematological events). Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable adverse events. With no
maximum study limit, all discontinuations of treatment
were considered early discontinuations.
Statistical Analysis
Primary outcome was OS with secondary endpoints of
time to tumor progression (TTP) and tumor response
rate. OS and TTP endpoints were assessed using the
Kaplan-Meier product limit method. Cox proportional
hazards were used to assess variable effects on treatment.
Comparisons for response between treatments and
between subgroups were assessed using Fisher exact test.
Sample size was selected to provide 80% power for the
comparison between the 2 arms using a 1-tailed test at the
.025 level (adjusted for 1 interim analysis). A 1-sided test
was used to facilitate the interim futility analysis, with a
.025 alpha value equivalent to a 2-sided test with a .05
alpha value. The sample size was chosen to provide at least
196 total events, with an allowance of 12 ineligible
patients. Also, as the hypothesis was a directional hypothesis, 1-sided testing is warranted.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Of the 308 patients enrolled in the MEL-002 trial,
306 were included in the intent-to-treat data analyses;
2 patients died after screening but before randomization. Overall, patients’ characteristics were well balanced over the 2 study arms (Table 1). Of the 154
patients treated with placebo, 49.4% were men, com-

148

pared with 54.6% of 152 patients treated with lenalidomide. Groups were similar in terms of patients
who had received prior treatments, with 25.3% of
patients having had prior radiation in the placebo
group, compared with 25.7% of patients in the lenalidomide group; nearly all patients had received prior
surgery for their cancer. Of the 306 patients from
both treatment arms, 50% had received prior chemotherapy, 5% had received prior immunotherapy, and
46% had received both prior chemotherapy and
immunotherapy. Baseline patient characteristics were
similar for ECOG performance status, sites of stage
IV melanoma, prior antineoplastic regimens, and
LDH level.
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
Tumor Response Rate
Of the 152 patients treated with lenalidomide, 128
patients were evaluable according to Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (Table 2). Among these
patients, no significant differences between treatment
(5.3%) and placebo (5.8%) were observed in overall
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors response
rates (P ¼ .82). Most patients in the study had stable disease or progression of disease as their best response. Stable disease as best response was observed in 65 (42.8%)
patients treated with lenalidomide and 51 (33.1%)
patients treated with placebo. Figure 1 shows the occurrence of stable disease over time. Throughout the course
of treatment, patients treated with lenalidomide showed
a higher rate of stable disease than patients treated with
placebo.
Time to Progression
Kaplan-Meier product limit estimation of TTP is shown
in Figure 2. Median TTP was 3.0 months for the patients
treated with lenalidomide and 2.1 months for those
treated with placebo. No significant difference in TTP
was observed between lenalidomide treatment and
placebo (P ¼ .19; Table 2).
Overall Survival
Figure 3 shows Kaplan-Meier product limit estimation of
OS. There were no significant differences in OS observed
between lenalidomide and placebo (P ¼ .32; Table 2).
Median OS for patients in the lenalidomide treatment
group was 5.9 months, compared with 7.4 months for
placebo. There were no significant differences in OS
observed for subgroup variables (Table 2).

Adverse Events
None of the placebo-treated patients discontinued as a
result of treatment-related adverse events, compared with
4.6% of patients treated with lenalidomide. Although
there were several instances where study medication was
temporarily stopped during a treatment cycle, adverse
events leading to dose reduction were not observed in any
patients. There were 3 patients who received concurrent
filgrastim for the treatment of neutropenia. Only 1
patient treated with lenalidomide experienced treatmentrelated thrombocytopenia (grade 3 or 4). In total, treatment-related myelosuppression was observed in 2.6% of
patients treated with placebo and 10% of patients treated
with lenalidomide. The most common treatment-related
adverse events in placebo-treated patients were nausea,
vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, and cancer pain, whereas in

Cancer

January 1, 2010

those treated with lenalidomide, fatigue, nausea, constipation, neutropenia, and diarrhea were the most commonly
observed treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events
(Table 3).
No treatment-related adverse events led to the death
of any patients treated with placebo, compared with 0.7%
of patients treated with lenalidomide. A patient died on
September 30, 2003 after being in the study for 39 days as
a result of treatment-related dyspnea (not otherwise
specified).

mainly because of lack of effect. More than half of the
patients in each arm had discontinued treatment by the
start of cycle 4 (41.4% of patients treated with lenalidomide started cycle 4, compared with 33.8% of those
treated with placebo). Throughout all cycles the median
dose received by patients was 25 mg in both the lenalidomide- and placebo-treated patients, with only 1 (0.7%)
patient treated with lenalidomide requiring a single dose
reduction at cycle 5. Dose reduction was because of a
combination of adverse events during the time frame that
included hypersensitivity rash, cough, neutropenia, and
constipation.

DISCUSSION
The currently available and approved drugs for the treatment of stage IV metastatic malignant melanoma are
inadequate for the treatment of this disease. To date, no
drug treatment has been shown to produce a clinically
meaningful improvement in the treatment of patients
with a very poor prognosis. Unfortunately, in the present

150

study lenalidomide as a single agent did not result in a
clinical benefit for these patients either; the results of this
study show no significant benefit in OS, TTP, or tumor
response rate.

Myelosuppression was a commonly observed
adverse event with lenalidomide treatment, as was the
case in MEL-001 (submitted for publication). In general, the treatment with lenalidomide resulted in manageable adverse events, with no need for dose
reductions.
Although lenalidomide does not seem to be beneficial in the treatment of stage IV refractory metastatic malignant melanoma as a single agent, future attempts to

Cancer

January 1, 2010

integrate this drug in the treatment of refractory metastatic malignant melanoma should focus on combination
therapy, where rationale exists. Preclinical studies using
lenalidomide in combination therapy suggest a promising
role for lenalidomide in metastatic melanoma. It has been
shown that lenalidomide in combination with tyrosine
kinase inhibitors such as sunitinib or sorafenib, or lowdose cyclophosphamide, is efficacious in both ocular
melanoma and cutaneous melanoma xenograft models.

Such findings warrant further investigation of lenalidomide combination therapy for the treatment of metastatic

observed in other studies.

Figure 4. Patient flow is shown. *Arm A ¼ placebo; Arm B ¼ lenalidomide 25 mg. ITT indicates intent to treat.

The lack of efficacy of lenalidomide could be
because of the advanced stage of disease in the malignant
melanoma patients. Immunomodulatory agents such as
cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 monoclonal
antibodies have been shown to have a limited impact in
advanced disease, which could be because of tumorinduced immunosuppression.27 Outcome could be
improved by finding synergistic combinations with other
agents that allow an immunomodulatory agent to act on a
highly tumor-burdened patient, or by treating patients at
an earlier stage of disease.
The selected dose of lenalidomide in the present
study (25 mg/d on Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle) is the
dose/schedule used in hematological malignancies. However, whether this dose is appropriate for single-agent use
in solid malignances remains to be confirmed. There are
data emerging from 2 different studies indicating that the
dose used in this study may not be optimal. In a phase 1
trial of patients with advanced solid tumors, the dose of
lenalidomide has reached 25 mg in combination with
75 mg/m2 docetaxel on a 3-weekly schedule, without the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lenalidomide being
achieved.28 In another phase 1 trial, the MTD was not
established in a cohort of patients treated with a dose-escalated regimen of lenalidomide (25 mg daily for the first

Cancer

January 1, 2010

7 days, the daily dose rising each week up to a maximum
daily dose of 150 mg).18 Higher doses of single-agent
lenalidomide may be feasible, if there is a dose-response
relationship for this agent. Suboptimal dosing may be
1 reason that the current study did not show any benefit
using lenalidomide.
Currently, lenalidomide treatment in combination
with dacarbazine is being tested in a phase 1, singlecenter dose-escalation study (MEL-003). Preliminary
results show a MTD for the combination of 2 drugs,
25 mg lenalidomide plus 800 mg/m2 dacarbazine, and
indicate manageable side effects in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma who are untreated with systemic chemotherapy. At the MTD, the combination
treatment resulted in a promising tumor control rate of
42%.29
In all, 25 mg of single-agent lenalidomide resulted
in outcomes comparable to placebo, and did not lead to a
clinically meaningful improvement in the treatment of refractory stage IV metastatic malignant melanoma. Lenalidomide remains an agent with potential in the treatment
of solid tumors. As lenalidomide toxicity was minimal
and easily managed, further studies are warranted to establish optimal dose, and to explore its potential as a combination therapy.
