ABSTRACT
Resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy is the major barrier to treating
epithelial ovarian cancer. To improve patient outcomes, it is critical to identify
the underlying mechanisms that promote platinum resistance. Emerging evidence
supports the concept that platinum-based therapies are able to eliminate the bulk of
differentiated cancer cells, but are unable to eliminate cancer initiating cells (CIC).
To date, the relevant pathways that regulate ovarian CICs remain elusive. Several
correlative studies have shown that Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation is associated
with poor outcomes in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).
However, the functional relevance of these findings remain to be delineated. We
have uncovered that Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation is a critical driver of HGSOC
chemotherapy resistance, and targeted inhibition of this pathway, which eliminates
CICs, represents a novel and effective treatment for chemoresistant HGSOC. Here
we show that Wnt/β-catenin signaling is activated in ovarian CICs, and targeted
inhibition of β-catenin potently sensitized cells to cisplatin and decreased CIC tumor
sphere formation. Furthermore, the Wnt/β-catenin specific inhibitor iCG-001 potently
sensitized cells to cisplatin and decreased stem-cell frequency in platinum resistant
cells. Taken together, our data is the first report providing evidence that the Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway maintains stem-like properties and drug resistance of
primary HGSOC PDX derived platinum resistant models, and therapeutic targeting of
this pathway with iCG-001/PRI-724, which has been shown to be well tolerated in
Phase I trials, may be an effective treatment option.

INTRODUCTION

of EOC cases are high-grade serous cancers [HGSOC],
which are initially highly sensitive to standard treatment of
cytoreduction surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy,
with response rate close to 85% [2]. In spite of such high
initial response to platinum, the outcomes are poor, with
5-year survival rate of less than 30% with the majority
of women who initially respond to platinum therapy
relapsing [2]. Growing evidence supports the concept that
platinum-based therapies are very efficient at eradicating
differentiated cancer cells, but are unable to effectively

Epithelial ovarian cancer [EOC] is the most lethal
gynecologic malignancy and is the fifth leading cause of
cancer deaths in women [1]. This year, it is estimated that
approximately 22,000 women will be newly diagnosed and
14,200 will succumb to this lethal disease in the United
States [1]. This poor overall survival is mainly due to
late-stage diagnosis, disease recurrence and resistance to
standard platinum-based chemotherapy. A large majority

eliminate CICs [3]. These rare populations of stem-like
cells are characterized by their ability to self-renew
indefinitely in an undifferentiated state. Furthermore,
they result in differentiated progeny of cells with high
proliferative and invasive capacity, thus driving the
expansion of drug-resistant tumors [3-6].
Cisplatin treatment of ovarian tumors is associated
with an increase in stem cell markers in the residual
tumors, and accordingly, ovarian tumors that are chemoresistant are reported to have increased expression of CIC
markers [3, 6-9]. Even though numerous ovarian CIC
markers have been identified, the signaling pathways
regulating this phenotype are not well-understood [10]. Indepth characterization of the pathways that contribute to
the emergence and maintenance of CICs in ovarian cancer
is necessary in order to identify novel ways of targeting
and eradicating CICs.
Canonical Wnt signaling, mediated through
β-catenin, is identified as a critical regulator of chemoresistance and CIC phenotype in many tumors, and
inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is reported to
increase sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents in cancers
[11-14]. However, the functional relevance of the Wnt/βcatenin pathway in regulating chemo-resistance and CIC
phenotype in ovarian tumors is poorly understood. Unlike
in other tumors, mutations in key signaling components
of the canonical Wnt pathway are rare in HGSOC.
However, several lines of evidence have implicated the
potential activation of the Wnt pathway in these tumors,
including (i) increased expression of β-catenin protein in
HGSOC tumors [15, 16] (ii) correlation between β-catenin
expression and poor survival in HGSOC and (iii) high
expression of several Wnt ligands has been reported to
be present in malignant ascites [17-19]. Most recently, a
clustering analysis of the ovarian cancer gene expression
data set of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has
identified altered Wnt/β-catenin components in tumors
with poor prognosis, suggesting possible regulatory
functions of Wnt/β-catenin in ovarian cancer [20]. In
addition, gene expression profiling of chemo-resistant
ovarian CICs has revealed up-regulation of several
pathways including Wnt/β-catenin, and has determined
an increase in CIC marker expression in these cells [21].
In sum, there have been numerous clinical correlations
highlighting the association between disrupted Wnt/βcatenin signaling and patient outcome, but the functional
relevance of this pathway in HGSOC remains to be
delineated. In this study, we have directly investigated
the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the regulation of
platinum resistance and stem-like properties in primary
HGSOC patient-derived platinum-resistant models. We
have identified Wnt/β-catenin as a novel driver of platinum
resistance by maintaining stem-like properties in HGSOC.
Targeted inhibition of this pathway overcomes platinum
resistance by eradicating CICs.

Wnt/β-catenin signaling is up-regulated in
platinum-resistant HGSOC tumors
In recent years, patient-derived xenograft (PDX)
models have been utilized to conserve original tumor
characteristics, such as heterogeneous histology, clinical
biomolecular signature, malignant phenotypes and
genotypes. Therefore, in order to assess the role of the
Wnt/β-catenin pathway in regulating platinum resistance,
we first examined the activity of this pathway in PDX
models that display varying sensitivity to platinumbased therapies. In order to generate PDX models,
chemotherapy-naive tumors were removed from patients
diagnosed with HGSOC and ~2mm3 tumor implants were
grafted subcutaneously into nu/nu mice and propagated.
Once excised, pathological comparison between the
primary patient tumor and the PDX tumor were performed
(Suppl. Figure 1). In order to assess platinum sensitivity,
once the PDX tumors reached a size of ~150mm3, the
mice were treated with 2.5mg/kg of cisplatin or PBS
control every other day. We found that the large majority
of all tumors tested correlated with the patients platinum
response. For example, the PDX tumor, OV145, which
was generated from a patient who was deemed platinumresistant given that she recurred within 6 months, was
inherently resistant to platinum-based therapies compared
to OV81, which was isolated from a patient who was
platinum-sensitive (Figure 1A). In addition, the platinum
therapy response of the cell lines generated from these
tumors also correlated with patient platinum status in-vitro
(Figure 1B). Upon confirmation of platinum sensitivity
among these PDX tumors, we assessed the activity of
the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Numerous Wnt/β-catenin
target genes, including Axin2, DKK2, Lef1, CD24 and
Lgr5, were increased in the platinum-resistant OV145
cells [derived from OV145 platinum resistant PDX], as
compared to the sensitive OV81.2 cells [derived from
platinum sensitive OV81 PDX] (Figure 1C). Expression
of the Wnt ligand WNT5A was very high in OV145,
indicating that the Wnt pathway is highly activated in
these platinum-resistant PDX-derived cells (Figure 1C).
Furthermore, OV145 exhibited increased Wnt pathway
activation, as shown through the utilization of an eGFP
reporter fused TCF/LEF-1 Wnt/β-catenin reporter vector,
which been shown to be an efficient indicator of β-cateninregulated transcriptional activity in association with TCF7/
LEF-1 [22, 23] (Figure 1D).
Next, in order to directly assess the effects of
platinum therapy on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, we
examined whether long-term platinum therapy altered the
activity of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in OV81.2 primary

tumor cells, derived from OV81 PDX. OV81.2 cells were
propagated in-vitro in the presence of cisplatin in order
to select for cells that have acquired platinum resistance
[which is henceforth referred to as CP10]. Cellular
viability assays revealed that CP10 was significantly
more resistant to cisplatin, in comparison to the parental
OV81.2 (Figure 2A). Furthermore, Annexin PI staining
and clonogenic assays confirmed that these cells are
highly resistant to platinum (Figure 2B and 2C). Annexin
V staining, upon treatment with 5μM cisplatin, was ~48%
in the platinum-sensitive OV81.2, as compared to ~8%
in the platinum-resistant CP10, which was similar to the
untreated cells (Figure 2B).
Given that emerging data suggest that platinumresistance may emerge due to an enrichment in CICs
[6], we next examined the ability of the newly generated
primary platinum resistant cells to form non-adherent

tumor spheres in serum-free stem-cell-selective conditions
[24], which have been shown to enrich for CIC subpopulations

and exhibit increased expression of CIC surface markers and
oncogenes compared to adherent cultures. Interestingly, both

CP10 and CP70, which is another established cisplatin
resistant tumor cell line, derived from the A2780 ovarian
tumor cell line [25], generated significantly more tumor
spheres then their isogenic platinum-sensitive matched cell
line (Figure 3A). Additionally, the platinum-resistant cells
also had higher expression of well-known CIC markers
like CD24, EpCAM and ALDH1, which are reported to be
direct targets of Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Suppl. Figure 2).
In order to further define the molecular
characteristics of these platinum-resistant stem-like cells,
we examined the expression and functional activity of the
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, given that platinumresistant PDX tumors revealed activation of this pathway

compared to platinum-sensitive PDX tumors [18].
Interestingly, β-catenin protein level was higher in both
CP10 and CP70 (Figure 3B), and this increased protein
expression correlated with both CP10 and CP70 exhibiting
>3-fold increase in TOP-eGFP Wnt reporter activity,
as compared to their platinum-sensitive counterparts,
showing that β-catenin-regulated transcriptional activity is
increased in cisplatin-resistant ovarian tumor cells (Figure
3C). In addition, TOP-eGFP reporter activity in platinumsensitive and resistant cells directly correlated with
cisplatin IC50 values in these cells (Figure 3D). Further
confirming up-regulated Wnt/β-catenin signaling in
platinum resistant cells, we found that mRNA expression
of Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional targets, TCF7, FZD1
and LEF-1, were up-regulated in platinum-resistant cells
(Figure 3E). Also, the expression of WNT5A was very
high in CP10 (Figure 3E), which was similar to the upregulation observed in OV145 (Figure 1C), suggesting that

the Wnt pathway is activated in both intrinsic (OV145)
and acquired (CP10) models of platinum resistance in
HGSOC.

Wnt activation confers platinum resistance in
primary ovarian tumor cells
To assess whether Wnt/ β-catenin pathway
activation can directly render cells resistant to platinum,
we overexpressed stabilized β-catenin S33Y [hereby
referred to as βS33Y] in the platinum-sensitive A2780
and OV81.2 cells (Figure 4A). TOP-eGFP reporter activity
was increased by βS33Y overexpression, indicating
activated Wnt/β-catenin axis in these cells (Figure 4B).
In addition, βS33Y overexpression increased the mRNA
expression of Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional targets TCF7,
FZD1, DKK1 and LEF-1 in both cell lines (Figure 4C-

4E). Overexpression of βS33Y increased the IC50 of
cisplatin by ~2-fold in both A2780 (p<0.01) and OV81.2
(p<0.001) (Figure 4F). This increase was higher in
OV81.2 βS33Y, which had higher TOP-eGFP reporter
activity, as compared to A2780 βS33Y (Figure 4B), thus
establishing a direct correlation between Wnt activation
and resistance to cisplatin. In accordance with the cellular
viability assays, Annexin-PI staining showed significantly
decreased cell death in cisplatin treated OV81.2 βS33Y, as
compared to the OV81.2 control (Figure 4G).

like properties, we performed loss of function assays
utilizing lentiviral shRNA mediated β-catenin knockdown
[26]. β-catenin mRNA and protein expression were
significantly downregulated in both the CP70 and CP10
platinum-resistant cells which stably expressed sh-βcatenin vector (Figure 5A and 5B), which correlated
with a significant decrease in TOP-eGFP reporter activity
(Figure 5C). β-catenin knockdown decreased the IC50
of cisplatin in both CP70 (2-fold, p<0.02) and CP10
(3-fold, p<0.01) (Figure 5D). The decrease in cisplatin
IC50 was more robust in CP10 sh-β-catenin cells that
had greater decrease in TOP-eGFP activity (Figure 5C),
highlighting the direct correlation between Wnt activity
and resistance to cisplatin. In addition, clonogenic
cellular survival assays further confirmed that β-catenin
knockdown increases cisplatin sensitivity in both CP70
and CP10 (Figure 5E). Furthermore, annexin-PI staining
showed a >3-fold increase in cell death upon cisplatin

treatment in CP10 sh-β-catenin cells, as compared to
CP10 sh-control (Figure 5F). Upon examination of the
expression of several CIC markers that have also been
shown to be direct targets of Wnt/β-catenin, we found
that CD24, LEF-1 and LGR5 were significantly reduced
upon β-catenin knockdown in CP10 primary platinum
resistant cells (Figure 5G). Consistent with these findings,
β-catenin-targeted inhibition also significantly diminished
the emergence of tumor spheres (Figure 5H). In order to
further evaluate the effect of β-catenin knockdown on stem
cell frequency in platinum resistant CP10, we employed
limiting dilution tumor sphere assay [LDA]. LDA tumor
sphere assays are increasingly being utilized to quantify
stem cell frequency in tumor cells plated at very low cell
density on non-adherent plates in serum free stem cell
selective culture conditions [27]. We found that β-catenin
knockdown drastically reduced the stem cell frequency in

CP10 by >16-fold, from ~1:5 cells to ~1:80 cells (Figure
5I), suggesting that β-catenin is critical for maintaining
stem-like properties in primary HGSOC platinum-resistant
cells.

β-catenin drives platinum resistance in ovarian
CICs
Since β-catenin knockdown robustly decreased
the stem cell frequency in platinum-resistant cells, we
further studied whether β-catenin drives drug resistance
in a cisplatin-resistant ovarian CIC model. Aldehyde
dehydrogenase positive [ALDHpos] ovarian tumor cells
have been identified as the CICs in ovarian cancer, and
are reported to be chemo-resistant and associated with
poor clinical outcomes [24, 28-32]. ALDH1A1 has
recently been identified as a direct target of β-catenin,

but the functional importance of this regulation is not
yet understood [33]. Therefore, in order to study the
role of β-catenin in regulating stem-like properties in
ovarian CICs, we isolated CICs from the CP70 using
ALDEFLOUR flow cytometry assay, which efficiently
detects the ALDH1 isoform of aldehyde dehydrogenase
[29, 33]. We found that CP70 cells had significantly higher
ALDH1 activity, as compared to the cisplatin-sensitive
A2780 cells (Figure 6A). We sorted ALDHpos population
from CP70 using ALDEFLOUR assay and observed that
ALDHpos CP70 cells were more resistant to platinum than
ALDHneg cells (p<0.05) (Figure 6B) and formed 4-fold
more tumor spheres under stem cell culture conditions

(Figure 6C). This tumor sphere-forming ability and
ALDH1 activity was retained across multiple passages in
stem cell culture conditions (Suppl. Figure 4) indicating
the self-renewal ability of these cells. We next investigated
whether β-catenin knockdown would abrogate the stemlike properties observed in the ALDHpos population.
Targeted shRNA of β-catenin knockdown (Figure 6D)
resulted in decreased TOP-eGFP reporter activity (Figure
6E) and robustly decreased the expression of the numerous
CIC markers such as ALDH1A1, CD24, EpCAM, LEF-1
and LGR5 (Figure 6F). Decrease in ALDH1A1 expression
upon β-catenin knockdown is consistent with the recently
reported finding that ALDH1A1 is a direct transcriptional

target of β-catenin [33]. Furthermore, consistent with the
decrease in CIC markers, β-catenin knockdown decreased
the ability of ALDHpos CICs to form tumor spheres (Figure
6G). Since decrease in stem-like population in tumor cells
induces chemo-sensitivity, we next looked at the effect
of β-catenin on cisplatin sensitivity of ALDHpos CICs.
β-catenin knockdown significantly decreased the IC50 for
cisplatin in these cells (p<0.001) (Figure 6H), suggesting
that β-catenin overcomes the platinum resistance of
ALDHpos CICs by decreasing stem-like properties of these
cells.

To further delineate the regulation of platinum
resistance in ovarian CICs by Wnt/β-catenin signaling,
we sorted out TOP-eGFP high and TOP-eGFP low cell
populations from ALDHpos CICs by FACS and studied
the differences in chemo-resistance between these two
populations (Figure 7A). TOP-eGFP highALDHpos cells
had increased expression of numerous Wnt targets and
CIC markers (Figure 7B). TOP-eGFP highALDHpos cells
were more resistant to cisplatin (p<0.0001) (Figure 7C)
and exhibited increased survival in response to cisplatin
treatment (Figure 7D). Collectively, these results indicate
that within the ovarian cancer ALDHpos CIC model, there

and hematological malignancies[11, 14, 35-37]. Prior to
looking at the effects of iCG-001 on platinum resistance
and stem-like properties, we first assessed its effects on the
Wnt signaling pathway to confirm down-regulation of this
pathway. We found that iCG-001 potently decreased TOPFlash Wnt reporter activity (Figure 8A) and expression of
Wnt/β-catenin targets in both CP70 and CP10 (Figure 8B)
platinum-resistant cells.
We next assessed the effect of iCG-001 on stem-like
properties in platinum-resistant CP10 and CP70 by LDA
tumor sphere assays. iCG-001 robustly decreased stem cell
frequency in CP10 and CP70 (Figure 8C). The decrease
in stem cell frequency of CP10 was ~23 fold (~1:6 to
~1:136) and in CP70 the decrease in stem-cell frequency
was ~11 fold (~1:7 to 1:77), showing that targeting the
β-catenin transcriptional axis greatly decreases stem-like
properties in HGSOC. iCG-001 also decreased stem-cell
frequency in ALDHpos ovarian CICs by ~20 fold (~1:2.3
to 1:46), showing that therapeutic targeting of β-catenin
could decrease stem-like properties in ovarian CICs
(Figure 8D). Since a decrease in stem-like properties
induces chemosensitivity, we next looked at the effect

Therapeutic targeting of β-catenin regulated
transcriptional activity overcomes platinum
resistance in chemo-resistant ovarian tumor cells
and decreases stem cell frequency
Since our results showed that Wnt/β-catenin activity
is a critical driver of chemo-resistance and stem-like
properties in ovarian tumor cells, we next explored the
possibility of therapeutic targeting of this pathway to
overcome platinum resistance. Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors
are reported to be effective in various tumor models and
are being tested for their ability to target CICs [11, 14, 34].
The Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor iCG-001/PRI-724 specifically
inhibits the β-catenin-regulated transcriptional axis

evaluated in phase 1 clinical trial in both solid tumors

of combination treatment with iCG-001 and platinum
across these models. Isobologram and combination index
(CI) analysis of iCG-001 and cisplatin combination
revealed that these drugs work in a synergistic manner in
CP10 cells (CI=0.8), or in an additive fashion in CP70
(CI=1.01) and ALDHpos ovarian CICs (CI=1.0) (Figure
8E). Collectively, these results show that therapeutic
targeting of the β-catenin transcriptional axis by iCG-001
decreases stem-like properties and sensitizes platinumresistant ovarian cancer cells.

absence of CIC-targeted therapies in ovarian cancer can
be mainly attributed to a lack of in-depth understanding
of the mechanisms driving and maintaining the stem-like
properties in these cells. Signaling pathways like Notch
have been implicated in regulating chemo-resistance
in ovarian CICs, and targeting these cells by gamma
secretase inhibitors [GSI] has been reported to increase
response to platinum [21], highlighting the importance
of understanding the underlying mechanisms driving
ovarian CICs in order to appropriately target this distinct
population of cells.
Numerous studies, including TCGA data analysis,
has reported altered Wnt/β-catenin components in
HGSOC, and correlative studies have shown that
activation of this pathway is associated with poor
patient outcomes [15, 17, 20]. In accordance with these
findings, in our present study we have uncovered that
activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is associated
with platinum-resistance in several in vivo and in vitro

DISCUSSION
Current platinum-based treatment regimens in
ovarian cancer are initially very effective at decreasing
tumor burden because of reduction in tumor cells that
are differentiated. However, CICs are known to be
platinum-resistant and thus constitute one of the root
causes of chemotherapy failure and tumor relapse. The

models. Specifically, we show that platinum-resistant PDX
mouse models of HGSOC and primary platinum-resistant
ovarian tumor cells have dramatically higher Wnt activity
compared to matched platinum-sensitive cells. Our results
support the involvement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in
both intrinsic and acquired platinum chemo-resistance.
Wnt reporter activity was up-regulated in both the intrinsic
model (OV145 PDX) and acquired model (OV81 PDX
derived CP10) of platinum resistance. Up-regulation of
Wnt ligand WNT5A was similar to both intrinsic and
acquired models of platinum resistance, suggesting that the
pathway is highly activated in both models of resistance.
Expression of the Wnt receptor FZD1 and the Wnt
feedback component DKK2 correlated with Wnt/β-catenin
activity and response to platinum in CP10 and CP70
models. Interestingly, the analysis of several publically
available ovarian cancer cohorts revealed that FZD1 and
DKK2 expression correlate with poor survival (Suppl.
Figure 3) suggesting that high FZD1 and/or DKK2
expression in tumors could signify increased platinumresistance and serve as a prognostic biomarker. Though
these strong correlative findings highlight the clinical
relevance of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation in
ovarian cancer, there was a need to assess the functional
significance of this pathway in order to determine whether
it is a relevant therapeutic target in HGSOC, especially
since mutations in Wnt/β-catenin pathway components
are not known to be common in HGSOC. Therefore,
we focused on the mechanistic role of Wnt/β-catenin
pathway and identified canonical Wnt signaling mediated
by β-catenin as a critical driver of platinum resistance in
HGSOC.
Specific modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway,
either by β-catenin overexpression or knockdown, directly
correlated with response to platinum-based therapy.
β-catenin knockdown reversed platinum resistance and
decreased stem cell frequency, which was associated with
a decrease in the expression of stem cell markers like
LEF-1 and LGR5. Intriguingly, these two markers were
recently shown to be highly expressed in the ovarian stem
cell niche [38], and LGR5 has been identified as a marker
for the stem cell population in ovary [39]. Accordingly,
the Wnt-specific inhibitor iCG-001 efficiently reversed
platinum resistance and decreased tumor sphere formation
in primary HGSOC cells. In further support of these
results, it was recently reported that niclosamide decreased
tumor sphere formation in ovarian tumors and Wnt activity
was decreased in niclosamide-treated ovarian tumors [40].
However, this study did not investigate whether the Wnt/
β-catenin pathway drives platinum resistance and stemlike properties. Additionally, niclosamide is known to
inhibit multiple signaling pathways apart from Wnt [41],
and hence, the effects observed in this study could be due
to inhibition of multiple signaling pathways. Wnt-specific
inhibitors, like iCG-001 used in our study, specifically
inhibit the β-catenin-regulated transcriptional axis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

important for stem cell maintenance and is a more ideal
drug to assess effects of Wnt-specific inhibition in ovarian
CICs. In addition, PRI-724 (clinical compound generated
from iCG-001) has shown an acceptable toxicity profile
in Phase I clinical trials, and is currently being tested in
several clinical trials. Thus, we uncovered that iCG-001
represent a clinically translatable drug which can: (1)
sensitize both primary and immortalized ovarian cancers
cell to cisplatin, (2) potently inhibit the Wnt signaling
pathway, and (3) potentially eradicate ovarian CICs.
Intratumor heterogeneity in cancers is known to be
associated with resistance to chemotherapy, and CICs are
thought to play an important role in establishment and
maintenance of this phenotype [42]. Ovarian tumors are
known to have high degree of intratumor heterogeneity
[43] and thus could contribute to chemotherapy resistance.
Therefore, our findings showing that within platinumresistant ALDHpos ovarian CIC population there exists a
sub-population of TOP-eGFPhigh (Wnt-active) cells that
are chemo-resistant and have higher expression of CIC
markers, suggesting that Wnt activity could be critical in
maintaining platinum resistance in ovarian CICs. Since
ALDH1 is identified to be a direct target of β-catenin, and
because we also saw a decrease in ALDH1 expression
upon β-catenin knockdown, it could be speculated that the
stem-like properties in ALDHpos CICs in ovarian cancers
could indeed be driven by β-catenin. Since primary
HGSOC tumors have great complexity in terms of
heterogeneity, TOP-eGFP sorting-based studies in primary
HGSOC tumors are a more ideal way to understand the
regulation of the phenotype and platinum resistance,
in the context of tumor heterogeneity by Wnt/β-catenin
signaling. In addition, TOP-eGFP based cell sorting in
primary HGSOC tumors could be an efficient means of
identifying gene signatures that reliably stratify Wnthigh
and Wntlow HGOSC tumors, thus enabling efficient Wnt/
β-catenin-targeted therapy. Combination of cisplatin with
CIC pathway-specific inhibitors in ovarian tumors could
lead to personalized therapies targeting chemo-resistant
subpopulations in ovarian tumors, thus forming an
attractive approach for CIC-targeted therapy. Since there is
extensive cross talk between the major signaling pathways
regulating CIC phenotype the combination of CIC
pathway-specific inhibitors with platinum-based regimens
could greatly improve patient outcome in ovarian cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
A2780 (cisplatin-sensitive) and CP70 (isogenic
cisplatin-resistant to A2780) cells were obtained from
Dr. Paul Modrich (Duke University). All cells used were
cultivated in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS
23730

Oncotarget

and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (recommended media).
Cells were cultured in 10mm plates in a humidified
atmosphere (5% CO2) at 37°C. At 70-90% confluence,
trypsin (0.25%)/EDTA solution was used to detach the
cells from the culture plate for passaging and used for
further experiments until passage 20. Cisplatin was
purchased from Mount Sinai Hospital Pharmacy. 10mM
stock solutions of iCG-001 (Selleckchem) were prepared
in DMSO (Fisher Scientific) and stored at -20°C. The
OV81.2 cell line was generated from re-engrafted tumors
that were derived from the ascites of a patient diagnosed
with HGSOC. After successful engraftment of tumor
cells into immunodeficient mice, tumor fragments were
isolated and propagated on tissue culture plates in-vitro. To
confirm tumorgenicity and conserved patient histology of
these primary HGSOC cells, 500,000 cells were injected
subcutaneously into immunodeficient mice and tumors
that formed were subjected to histopathological analysis
to allow for comparison to primary patient tumor. The
platinum-resistant derivative of OV81.2, namely, CP10,
was generated by propagating OV81.2 in the presence of
2.5μM cisplatin for 10 passages.

synthesis from 1μg of total RNA was done using the
Transcriptor Universal cDNA Master kit (Roche). SYBR
Green-based Real-time PCR was subsequently performed
in triplicate using SYBR-Green master mix (Roche) on
the Light Cycler 480 II Real-time PCR machine (Roche).

Flow cytometry analysis and sorting
For ALDH based sorting, ALDH assay was done
using the ALDEFLUOR kit as per the protocol instructions
(Stem cell Technologies) and ALDH positive and negative
cells were FACS sorted using BD FACS Aria II. For
ALDH activity assessment, the same kit was used and the
data was acquired with Coulter Epics XL machine. For
TOP-eGFP sorting, eGFP low and high populations were
sorted from TOP-eGFP transduced stable cell lines using
BD FACS Aria II.

Immunoblotting
Whole cell protein extracts were probed with
antibodies against β-catenin (1:500) (Cell Signaling) and
GAPDH (1:1000) (Santa Cruz) as previously described
[45]. Membranes were exposed using LumiLight or
LumiLightplus (Roche) method following manufacturer’s
instructions.

Generation of stable cell lines
Several stable cell lines were generated for this study
and the same protocol was followed as described below.
TOP-eGFP lentiviral plasmid was acquired from Addgene
(Addgene plasmid 24314 [22] deposited by Dr. Roel
Nusse lab). β-catenin lentiviral shRNA plasmid (Addgene
plasmid 18803[26] deposited by Dr. Bob Weinberg’s lab)
and the corresponding pLKO.1 control plasmid (Addgene
plasmid 8453[44] deposited by Dr. Bob Weinberg’s lab)
were acquired from Addgene. For lentiviral transfection
with the constructs, Lenti Starter Kit (System Biosciences)
was used. Briefly, 3M 293T cells were plated in 10cm
plate with antibiotic-free media. At 50-70% confluence,
2ug of plasmid and 10ug of pPACKH1-plasmid mix were
co-transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
following manufacturer’s protocol. 48 hours later, virus
particles were harvested and precipitated. Target cells
were transduced by plating 100,000 cells/well in a 6
well plate with virus particles and 4μg/mL polybrene and
analyzed 72 hrs later. β-catenin-S33Y retroviral plasmid
was a kind gift from Dr. Ken-Ichi Takemaru (Stony
Brook University). For retroviral transfections, retrovirus
was generated by co-transfection of the constructs with
packaging plasmids into Phx cells. Target cells were
transduced as described above.

Cell viability assay
Cells were plated in 12-well plate at 50,000 cells/
well and treated the next day with the corresponding
drugs. After 24hrs or 48hrs, cells were then incubated
with 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazolyl) for 2hrs and absorbance
was measured at 600nm. Isobologram analysis was done
using GraphPad Prism software.

Clonogenic assay
Cell survival was assessed through seeding 1000
cells/well in a 6-well plate and treated with indicated doses
of cisplatin once every 3 days. On day 7, cells were fixed
in a 10% acetic acid/10% methanol (in diH2O) solution
and stained with 1% crystal violet (in methanol) after 7
days of growth. Colonies were counted using Image J.

Annexin V/PI staining
Cells were plated 200,000 cells/ well in a 6-well
plate. The next day, cells were treated with drug and
harvested 72 hours later. Annexin V/PI Staining was done
using the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit II (BD
Pharmigen). FACS data was acquired using the Coulter
Epics XL machine.

RNA extraction and real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using the Total RNA
Purification Plus Kit (Norgen Biotek) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. For mRNA analysis, cDNA

Tumor sphere formation assay

None.

For tumor sphere formation assays, 1000 cells per
ml were plated in 2ml in 6-well ultra-low attachment
plate (Corning) in MammoCult medium (Stem cell
Technologies) and after the indicated timepoint, 10x10
stitch imaging was done at 10x (100 random images
acquired) using an Retiga Aqua Blue camera (Q Imaging,
Vancouver, BC) connected to a Leica DMI6000 inverted
microscope. Individual images were taken and then a
composite image was generated using the scan slide
function in Metamorph Imaging Software (Molecular
Devices, Downington, PA). Subsequent integrated analysis
also used Metamorph software. For limiting dilution
sphere assays, BD FACS Aria II sorter was used to sort
cells directly into 96-well ultra-low attachment plates
in 200μl mammocult media per well (Corning). After 7
days, the number of wells with tumor spheres was counted
and the data was analyzed by Extreme Limited Dilution
Analysis [ELDA] platform to determine the stem cell
frequency.
