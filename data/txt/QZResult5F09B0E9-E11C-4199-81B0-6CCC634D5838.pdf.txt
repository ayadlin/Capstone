Abstract
Targeting molecular markers and pathways implicated in cancer cell growth is a promising avenue for developing effective therapies. Although the Ki-67 protein (pKi-67) is a key marker associated with aggressively
proliferating cancer cells and poor prognosis, its full potential as a therapeutic target has never before been
successfully shown. In this regard, its nuclear localization presents a major hurdle because of the need for
intracellular and intranuclear delivery of targeting and therapeutic moieties. Using a liposomally encapsulated
construct, we show for the first time the specific delivery of a Ki-67–directed antibody and subsequent lighttriggered death in the human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-5. Photoimmunoconjugate-encapsulating liposomes (PICEL) were constructed from anti–pKi-67 antibodies conjugated to fluorescein 5(6)-isothiocyanate, as
a photoactivatable agent, followed by encapsulation in noncationic liposomes. Nucleolar localization of the
PICELs was confirmed by confocal imaging. Photodynamic activation with PICELs specifically killed pKi-67–
positive cancer cells both in monolayer and in three-dimensional (3D) cultures of OVCAR-5 cells, with the
antibody TuBB-9 targeting a physiologically active form of pKi-67 but not with MIB-1, directed to a different
epitope. This is the first demonstration of (a) the exploitation of Ki-67 as a molecular target for therapy and (b)
specific delivery of an antibody to the nucleolus in monolayer cancer cells and in an in vitro 3D model system.
In view of the ubiquity of pKi-67 in proliferating cells in cancer and the specificity of targeting in 3D multicellular acini, these findings are promising and the approach merits further investigation. Cancer Res; 70(22);

Introduction
Targeted agents that block or interrupt specific pathways
intricately involved in tumor growth and cancer cell proliferation hold promise for effective patient-customized treatment. The choice of the molecular target around which to
design molecularly targeted therapies then becomes a key
factor. In that context, the nuclear protein Ki-67 (pKi-67) is
a compelling candidate. It is strongly expressed in proliferating cells (1, 2) and is an established prognostic indicator for
the assessment of cell proliferation in biopsies from cancer
patients (3). Despite the important role of pKi-67 as a diagnostic marker, three challenges have limited its suitability as
a target for cancer therapy: (a) lack of targeting moieties that

specifically recognize the physiologically active form of pKi67; (b) lack of effective vehicles for intracellular delivery that
effectively transport the targeting moiety to the appropriate
subcellular site; and (c) the inability to link the targeting
mechanism with an externally activatable intervention strategy for additional specificity that neutralizes the active state
of pKi-67.
We address these challenges using a multifunctional
(fluorescence and therapy) nanotechnology platform for intracellular delivery of TuBB-9, a recently developed monoclonal antibody (mAb; ref. 4) that specifically recognizes a
physiologically active form of pKi-67, in combination with a
photoactivatable agent in a photochemistry-based approach
called photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT involves the excitation of light-activatable chemicals to trigger site-specific
photochemistry for localized damage via active molecular
species, because of which very specific target damage can
be achieved (5–7). In this study, we show the first antibody-targeted inactivation of a nuclear protein in large cell
populations. This was made feasible through nanotechnology-derived liposomal delivery of an antibody. We subsequently present the first evidence that inactivation of the
proliferation marker pKi-67 leads to cell death in proliferating cells only. Figure 1 shows the proposed schema of the
targeting strategy. TuBB-9 antibody is conjugated to a PDT
agent to yield a photoimmunoconjugate (PIC), which is
then encapsulated into noncationic PEGylated liposomes

Ki-67 as a Molecular Target for Therapy

Figure 1. Envisioned schema showing proposed mechanism of nanotechnology-mediated subcellular antibody delivery and subsequent light inactivation
of pKi-67, leading to ovarian cancer cell death. TuBB-9 antibody is conjugated to fluorescein 5(6)-isothiocyanate (FITC) to yield a PIC, which is then
encapsulated into noncationic PEGylated liposomes to provide PICELs. (MIB-1–FITC conjugates are also encapsulated in liposomes and used as
control but are not shown in the schema.) These PICELs are internalized by OVCAR-5 cells, and a fraction of the TuBB-9–FITC conjugates are released
into the cytoplasm. Within 24 h, the conjugates relocalize into the nucleus. Proposed mechanisms for this relocalization are the cotransport of the
antibody-FITC conjugates with the Ki-67 protein, after its synthesis in the cytoplasm, or binding to pKi-67 during mitosis after breakdown of the nuclear
envelope. Light irradiation inactivates the Ki-67 protein and is followed by cell death of the ovarian cancer cells.

to provide PIC-encapsulating liposomes (PICEL). These are
taken up by ovarian cancer cells on incubation by a combination of endocytic and liposome fusion processes. A fraction of the liposomes release the mAb into the cytoplasm of
the cancer cell. Within 24 hours, the mAb relocalizes into
the nucleus, consistent with earlier reports using single-cell
injections (8). The putative relocalization mechanism involves the cotransport of the mAb with newly synthesized
Ki-67 protein, or binding to pKi-67 during mitosis after
breakdown of the nuclear envelope. Light irradiation triggers inactivation of the Ki-67 protein and cell death of
the ovarian cancer cells.
Liposomes are self-assembling spherical vesicles made of
lipids and have been extensively investigated for drug delivery in cancer and noncancer applications (9). Several liposomal drugs have already been approved for clinical use. The
drugs that have been encapsulated in liposomes range from
chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin (10) to photoactivatable agents such as benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid (11), a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved
PDT agent. Liposomes make it possible to intracellularly
deliver large macromolecule drugs to their site of action,
although the delivery of an antibody via encapsulation has
never been reported. Cationic liposomes have been investigated for delivery of proteins to cells (12, 13) but initiate
extreme inflammatory response and neurotoxicity (14). Here,
we use noncationic PICELs for intracellular delivery of the

mAbs TuBB-9 and MIB-1 recognizing pKi-67. TuBB-9 and
MIB-1 are directed against different epitopes of pKi-67 and
recognize pKi-67 fractions, which seem to regulate different
cellular functions. These mAbs also exhibit different subnuclear staining patterns, probably caused by differential
epitope masking (4).
Previous studies have shown that the fraction of pKi-67
recognized by TuBB-9 colocalizes with components of the
rRNA transcription machinery and binds to the promoter
region of the ribosomal genes in the nucleoli (4). Light inactivation after TuBB-9–FITC microinjection led to a profound
inhibition of rRNA synthesis (15). In contrast, the rRNA synthesis machinery was independent of pKi-67 regulation when
cells were microinjected with the pKi-67–recognizing mAb
MIB-1. These results instigated the current investigation
where we sought to exploit this reported specific inactivation
of pKi-67 in single cells for cancer cell killing using PDT,
which allows for an external trigger of cell death. PDT is
an approved treatment modality for various malignant and
nonmalignant diseases and is FDA approved as first-line
treatment for age-related macular degeneration. PDT involves light-based activation of a nontoxic chemical called
photosensitizer to produce cytotoxic free radicals (5–7).
In this study we use a recently developed in vitro threedimensional (3D) model of disseminated ovarian micronodules as a biologically relevant research platform that is
conducive to longitudinal imaging and quantitative assessment

of treatment response (16–18). This model system is adapted
from the pioneering work of Bissel and colleagues (19) in
breast cancer research, in which it was shown that cells overlaid on a bed of Matrigel with the proper composition of stromal factors will form multicellular 3D acini. These 3D models
have led to powerful insights into the role of tissue architecture
in cell signaling and tumor growth behavior that would not be
possible in traditional monolayer cultures (20–22). However,
the power of such systems to serve as more physiologically
relevant reporters of treatment response has been underused.
For example, such 3D systems recapitulate challenges for drug
delivery that are similar to those encountered during i.p.
administration of drugs in intra-abdominal metastatic disease.
Our 3D model system generates 3D ovarian nodules that are
similar in size to the micrometastatic tumor nodules studding
the peritoneal surfaces in vivo.
Using this ovarian cancer 3D model system and monolayer
cell culture, we show that epitope-specific PDT induced killing
of OVCAR-5 cells with PICELs constructed from anti–pKi-67
antibodies conjugated to FITC, as a photoactivatable agent,
followed by encapsulation in noncationic liposomes. This
photodynamic activation with PICELs synthesized with the
antibody TuBB-9 specifically killed pKi-67–positive cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and labeling
The mouse mAbs against pKi-67, MIB-1, and TuBB-9
were generated at the Research Center Borstel as described by Bullwinkel and colleagues (4) and Cattoretti
and colleagues (23). For conjugation of the antibodies to
FITC (fluorescein 5(6)-isothiocyanate, Sigma), FITC
(2.57 mmol/L in DMSO) and antibody (6.58 μmol/L in sodium carbonate buffer) were mixed in a molar ratio of 20:1.
The solution was incubated at room temperature on a
shaker for 2 hours, and the labeled protein was purified
with a NAP-5 Sephadex column (GE Healthcare). After elution with TBS [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 150 mmol/L
NaCl], the labeled antibodies were concentrated with Microcon tubes (Millipore) and redissolved in TBS (pH 7.4).
From the absorbance A(λ), the protein concentration
(cprot) and the average amount of fluorochromes per antibody (η) were calculated using the formula shown below.
The FITC to antibody ratios varied from 1.3 to 2.3 molecules
of FITC per antibody over 10 conjugation reactions.

Preparation of PICELs
Liposomes encapsulating antibody conjugates were prepared by adapting the procedure described by Sengupta
and colleagues (24). Briefly, the lipids (phosphatidylcholine,
cholesterol, and phosphatidylethanolamine), each separately

dissolved in chloroform, were mixed together in a molar ratio
of 2:1:0.2 and placed in a glass vial; chloroform was evaporated from the vial under a stream of nitrogen. The residual
chloroform was removed by placing this vial in a desiccator
under vacuum for 1 hour. An aqueous solution of the antibody-FITC conjugate was then added at 65°C, a temperature
greater than the highest value of the fluid-solid transition
temperature (Tm) for the lipids in the mixture. The solution
was incubated for 1 hour at 65°C. The resulting dispersion of
multilamellar vesicles was extruded through 200-nm-diameter
polycarbonate membranes by using a mini-extruder system
(Avanti Polar Lipids) to form unilamellar vesicles. The resulting PICELs were then analyzed by dynamic light scattering
(DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Unencapsulated antibody-FITC conjugates were removed by gel
filtration, and the concentrations were determined by fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy.
Cell lines and culture conditions
Human ovarian carcinoma cells NIH:OVCAR-5 (OVCAR-5)
were purchased from Fox Chase Cancer Center (Philadelphia,
PA), where they were characterized by microsatellite marker
analysis. The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% FCS, 2% L-glutamine, and 50 units/mL penicillin/
streptomycin. Human lung fibroblast cells MRC-5 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, where
they were characterized by cytochrome oxidase I assay and
inverse sequence-tagged repeat analysis. MRC-5 cells
were grown in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% FCS,
2% L-glutamine, and 50 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin.
All in vitro experiments were carried out with cell lines that
were passaged within 6 months after initiation of the cell culture. Monolayer cells were plated for irradiation experiments
on 35-mm plastic dishes (BD Biosciences). For the 3D tissue
culture, OVCAR-5 cells were plated on the 14-mm glass area
of 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek). First, the glass
surface was coated with 80 μL of growth factor–reduced
Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The plating was fulfilled on ice
because Matrigel solidifies rapidly at room temperature.
After 30 minutes of incubation, 200 μL of OVCAR-5 were
plated on the Matrigel bed in a concentration of 18,000
cells/mL. The culture dishes were then incubated at 37°C
to allow for cell adhesion on the gel. After 1 hour, the medium volume in each dish was brought to 2 mL, containing 2%
Matrigel. The 3D culture was maintained with RPMI 1640
supplemented with 2% Matrigel.
Flow cytometric determination of the Ki-67 status
For flow cytometric analysis, cells were incubated for
5 minutes in 0.05% trypsin/EDTA. 3D cell cultures were
incubated up to 30 minutes in 0.25% trypsin/EDTA. Cell
suspension aliquots (500 μL, 2 × 106 cells/mL) were fixed
for 10 minutes on ice by addition of 500 μL of 4% ice-cold
paraformaldehyde to a final concentration of 2%. After addition of 2 mL of ice-cold PBS, cells were collected by centrifugation (400 × g for 5 minutes), resuspended in 500 μL
of ice-cold PBS/0.25% Triton X-100, and incubated for 5
minutes on ice. Cells were then washed by adding 2 mL

of ice-cold PBS followed by centrifugation at 400 × g. Subsequently, the cells were then resuspended in 500 μL PBS/
0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) containing the primary
antibody MIB-1–FITC at a concentration of 2 μg/mL and
incubated for 1 hour on ice in the dark. After addition of
2 mL of ice-cold PBS, cells were centrifuged at 400 × g and
then resuspended in 500 μL PBS/0.5% BSA containing
50 μg/mL propidium iodide (to stain DNA) and 50 μg/mL
RNase. Cells were incubated for an additional 30 minutes at
37°C and then analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer.
To derive cell cycle fractions G1-G0, S, and G2-M from DNA
histograms, we took care to include only single cells in our

analysis and to exclude G0-G1 doublets, which were discriminated using pulse height versus pulse width of the propidium
iodide signal (25).
Irradiation of monolayer and 3D culture cells
Cells were irradiated with an argon laser (Innova 100,
Coherent) at 488 nm, which is in close proximity to the
absorption maximum of FITC of ∼494 nm. The beam
was widened to a spot of 3.5-cm diameter with an irradiance of ∼70 mW/cm2. Irradiation energy was measured with
an Ophir Vega power meter with a photodiode sensor
(Ophir Optronics).

Multiphoton fluorescence imaging of in vitro
3D nodules
Images were acquired using an inverted Olympus FV1000
MPE microscope equipped with Spectra-Physics DeepSee
Ti:Sapphire laser tuned to 750 nm to excite endogenous fluorescence of flavin chemical species in 3D micronodules. A
40× objective water immersion objective (Olympus) was used
to acquire high-resolution images through the Matrigel bed.
3D volumes were collected by acquiring image stacks in
2-μm axial steps. Two non-descanned detectors collected
the autofluorescence emission using violet (440–490 nm)
and green (510–550 nm) band-pass filters. The final
images and depth stack movies were processed using
ImageJ. This label-free autofluorescence imaging allows
nonperturbative imaging of samples without administration of exogenous contrast agents and allows cultures
to be maintained for continued growth and treatment
response studies. In displayed images, contrast was
enhanced using hi-lo lookup table in ImageJ software.

imaging. Following incubation, images of the calcein fluorescence emission (as a reporter of viability) and the ethidium bromide fluorescence emission (as a reporter of cell
death) were obtained using the appropriate excitation/
emission filters on an Axiovert 100 TV inverted microscope
(Zeiss) at several spatial fields in each treated culture dish.
Images were captured with a charge-coupled device camera
(Quantifire XI, Optronix) and saved as 12-bit TIFFs for later
analysis. Using a custom batch process routine developed
in the MATLAB software package (MathWorks), sets of
images were analyzed in high throughput to report the
mean fluorescence signal from the calcein and ethidium
bromide channels with the ratio of calcein fluorescence
to total fluorescence (calcein plus ethidium) as a reporter
of viability. The ratio was computed in this manner for
all treatment groups and normalized to the no-treatment
control group to calculate percentage viability for each
treatment.

Cell viability assay for monolayer and 3D culture cells
To assess cell viability in monolayer cell cultures, the
MTT assay, which measures mitochondrial dehydrogenase
activity, was used. Assessment of cytotoxic response in
the 3D culture model posed an additional challenge, as
the conversion products from traditional MTT and MTS
assays were found to adhere to the Matrigel substrate,
preventing reliable reporting of viability by these methods.
To overcome this, we developed a quantitative fluorescence
imaging–based approach using the LIVE/DEAD Cytotoxicity
kit (Invitrogen). Culture dishes of 3D nodules were
first washed with PBS and then incubated at 37°C for
40 minutes with 2 μmol/L calcein AM and 4 μmol/L ethidium homodimer-1 (Invitrogen) diluted in PBS before

PICELs deliver pKi-67 antibodies intracellularly and

pKi-67 antibodies and a lipid bilayer were characterized
by DLS to be in a size range of approximately 180 nm
(see Supplementary Fig. S1). TEM images of polymer containing liposomes prepared similar to PICELs showed a
spherical morphology of the liposomal constructs. There
was no attempt to vary the size of the PICELs.
The subcellular localization of PICELs in OVCAR-5 cells
was established by confocal laser scanning microscopy
(CLSM) following a 24-hour incubation of PICELs with
OVCAR-5 cells at concentrations of 20 nmol/L FITC equivalent. CLSM showed the fluorescence for both mAbs (TuBB-9

and MIB-1) to be nucleolar, coincident with the putative
pKi-67 site (Fig. 2A).
To investigate if cell death was triggered by PDT, the
OVCAR-5 cells incubated with PICELs for 24 hours were
irradiated with an argon laser at 488 nm with 5 J/cm2.
MTT analysis showed a dramatic 95% decrease in cell
viability with L-TuBB-9–FITC at 72 hours, whereas no
significant effect on viability in cells incubated with LMIB-1–FITC was observed. Cell viability decrease was time
dependent, from 35% 24 hours after irradiation to 20% 48
hours after irradiation and to 5.15% 72 hours after irradiation (Fig. 2B). The controls show that irradiation of the
non–PICEL-free TuBB-9–FITC antibody has no significant
influence on cell viability. Cell viability was unaffected by
irradiation of cells without any conjugate or TuBB-9 PICEL

incubation without light. All experiments were done during
log phase of OVCAR-5 cell growth, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. During this phase, the percentage of cells
that stain positive for pKi-67 is the highest (26).
3D cultures show loss of spherical structure and
increase in cell death
To evaluate efficacy of Ki-67–targeted PDT in a more
biologically relevant system, we conducted treatment
response studies in a 3D in vitro model of ovarian cancer.
As shown in Fig. 3, OVCAR-5 cells grown on GFR Matrigel
formed multicellular 3D acini. Supplementary Movie S1
shows a multiphoton z-scan through an acinus. Although
formed from the same cell line used in monolayer experiments, molecular targets are differentially expressed when

in 3D cultures incubated with L-TuBB-9–FITC (Fig. 4C). As
in monolayer, the liposomal MIB-1–FITC construct shows
no significant cytotoxicity, nor did the free TuBB-9–FITC
antibody or cells without any conjugate or cells treated with
TuBB-9 PICELs without light irradiation.
PDT against pKi-67 kills selectively proliferating cells
Specificity of this approach for pKi-67–positive cells was
tested in 80% confluent human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5),
where only a small population of cells expresses pKi-67. Flow
cytometry staining of pKi-67 in MRC-5 cells showed that
cells grown to confluency expressed pKi-67 in <20% of cells
(Fig. 5A), whereas nonconfluently grown cells were ∼80%
positive for pKi-67 (Supplementary Fig. S3A). To test the
treatment efficacy on low Ki-67–expressing noncancer cells,
we incubated MRC-5 cells with the PICELs and determined
cell viability after light irradiation. Interestingly, the MRC-5
cells grown to confluency showed no significant effect on cell
viability with either of the constructs (Fig. 5B). In contrast,
nonconfluent cells showed a decrease in cell viability to
22% after 48 hours when incubated with L-TuBB-9–FITC
(Supplementary Fig. S3B).

Discussion

Figure 5. Treatment of a noncancer cell line, human lung fibroblast cells
(MRC-5), shows the specificity of the approach for Ki-67–positive
proliferating cells. A, flow cytometry for Ki-67 status in 80% confluent
MRC-5 cells reveals that only a small fraction of cells is pKi-67 positive.
B, viability of MRC-5 cells after irradiation with a 488-nm laser (5 J/cm2) is
assessed by standard MTT assay. Confluent cells with low pKi-67
expression show negligible loss of viability following incubation with both
anti–pKi-67 liposomal constructs and light irradiation.

key physiologic architectural cues are restored. Flow cytometry measurements established that >90% of the cells in
monolayer cultures are pKi-67 positive (Fig. 4A), whereas
in 3D culture only 40% of the cells were positive for pKi67, which is similar to the in vivo situation (27, 28). The
expression of pKi-67 in fewer cells in 3D models compared
with monolayer cells has been described before (29, 30) and
is most likely the result of differential gene expression induced by differential architectural cues in the two geometries. PDT-mediated cell death triggering in 3D cultures was
investigated by incubating the cultures with PICELs containing 20 nmol/L equivalent of FITC for 48 hours followed
by 488-nm illumination with 5 J/cm2. Time-lapse imaging
over 70 hours showed a striking loss of acinar structure,
which was most prominent 20 to 40 hours after irradiation
(Fig. 4B; Supplementary Movies S2–S5). This disaggregation
of the acini was only observed after L-TuBB-9–FITC treatment, targeting the active form of pKi-67 and not with the
MIB-1 constructs. The live/dead ratio, normalized to un-

This study establishes the first antibody-targeted inactivation of a nucleolar protein in large populations of living cells
and provides the first evidence that inactivation of the proliferation marker pKi-67 leads to cell death specifically in
proliferating cells. Most protein knockdown methods interfere with the synthesis pathway of the protein (31, 32); however, here, we show a new approach for targeting the protein
itself. Fabrication of the noncationic PICELs made the delivery of antibodies into the cell cytoplasm possible, leading ultimately to a relocalization of the mAbs to the actual pKi-67
site inside the nucleus and particularly in the nucleoli. This
nuclear relocalization has been described earlier (8), but the
exact mechanism is not known and needs to be further investigated. Our findings show the specificity of the photoinactivation, as photoactivatable FITC is delivered to the
nucleoli of the cells with both antibodies, but only pKi-67 targeted with TuBB-9 constructs leads to cell death. The possible inactivation mechanism involves photo–cross-linking of
the antibody with the target protein or binding partners. Singlet oxygen-dependent cross-linking after irradiation of fluorescein has been reported before and leads to oxidation
of methionine side chains (15, 33, 34). The radius of
inactivation of light-irradiated FITC is in the range of a few
nanometers (35) and explains the high specificity of the
observed effects. Although FITC has a low triplet state quantum yield and thus a very low propensity for PDT (singlet
oxygen quantum yield of 3% in aqueous solution), its conjugation to antibodies apparently alters its photophysical properties such that it can be an effective PDT agent similar to
malachite and indocyanine green (35, 36). In a first study
such as the one presented here, the use of FITC offers several
advantages, such as easy conjugation to antibodies and its

Ki-67 as a Molecular Target for Therapy

hydrophilic nature diminishes problems that may arise due
to PIC aggregation. It has been widely used for specific light
inactivation of proteins in living cells (35, 37). FITC has an
excitation maximum of 490 nm, and although this may be
well suited for cancers of the skin, it is not ideal for deep
tissue-targeted photodestruction due to the fairly limited
penetration of light at this wavelength. For targeting cancers
of deeper tissues, use of a clinically relevant, longer-wavelength photosensitizer with a higher singlet oxygen quantum
yield may seem to be more appropriate. Using such photosensitizers, the same extent of photoinactivation could be
initiated with lower irradiation energies.
Previous studies have shown that only the fraction of pKi67 recognized by TuBB-9 and not by MIB-1 is associated with
the synthesis of rRNA (4) and that this synthesis was inhibited by light inactivation after TuBB-9–FITC microinjection
(15). Here, we show that inactivation of pKi-67 with TuBB9 leads to cell death in OVCAR-5 monolayer as well as in
3D cultures, and in keeping with the earlier findings, we
observed a significant decrease in viable cells only when
pKi-67 was targeted with TuBB-9, but not with MIB-1. pKi67 is believed to occur in two different fractions in the cell
nucleus, which are presumably associated with different
binding partners and seem to regulate different cellular functions. The observed cell death may not be solely due to pKi67 inactivation but also due to the effect of the evolving
cross-links on binding partners such as the transcription factor upstream binding factor and its loss of function initiating
subsequent cell death.
In 3D culture, our flow cytometry studies indicated that
∼40% of the cells express pKi-67. Relative to nontreated control, >70% of the cells showed a loss of viability 72 hours after
PDT with TuBB-9 PICELs. PDT with TuBB-9 PICELs initiates
cell death in proliferating cells, and this could prevent further
growth relative to the nontreated control, where the proliferating cells continue to divide and grow over 72 hours. These
data are consistent with the more pronounced loss in viability seen over 3 days with the TuBB-9 PICELs PDT. Another
factor that most likely increases cell death observed is the
bystander effect, where cells, which are in close proximity
to affected cells, can be indirectly affected as well. Bystander
responses, induced by defusing mediators, have been well
described after photodynamic treatment (38). In a 3D model,
these effects would be far more pronounced than in monolayer cultures because the bystander effects can propagate in
all three dimensions. The 3D spheres in our ovarian cancer
3D model are similar to tumor nodules in the human disease,
which often occur as regrowth after tumor debulking. The
observed profound structural degradation of tumor nodules
in 3D culture after pKi-67 PDT is encouraging and provides

interesting possibilities for combination treatments with
chemotherapeutic agents, where drug penetration into the
acini is a barrier.
In conclusion, the results of the study suggest for the first
time that pKi-67 is potentially an attractive therapeutic target in cancer, in addition to being a prognostic marker. Due
to the ubiquitous expression in all proliferating cells and the
prognostic value of the Ki-67 index in many cancers, inactivation of pKi-67 could be a promising strategy for the treatment not only of ovarian cancer but also of numerous
malignancies. Noncationic PICELs are particularly useful
for the subcellular delivery of mAbs and also provide multifunctional constructs for imaging and therapy, which may be
exploited further for encapsulating multiple compartmentalized agents. A broader significance of this study is that it provides a platform for targeting of other nuclear proteins that
may regulate cell proliferation, such as histones and transcription factors. The application of light for specific inactivation of proteins in living cells has been reported before for
pKi-67 and other proteins (15, 36), although associated cell
killing was never shown. PDT, a photochemistry-based
approach, is an approved treatment for many pathologies
and also in early or advanced clinical trials for others. This
externally triggered modality provides an additional level of
selectivity of cell killing due to the confinement of damage
only to tissue exposed to light. This overall approach combining PDT with pKi-67 targeting holds promise as an effective
cancer therapy and merits further development, requiring testing in more sophisticated in vitro models and appropriate
in vivo models with longer-wavelength photosensitizers.
