Abstract

Author Manuscript

Mutations in tumor suppressor BRCA1 lead to breast and/or ovarian cancer. Here we show that
loss of BRCA1 in mice results in transcriptional derepression of the tandemly repeated satellite
DNA. BRCA1 deficiency is accompanied by reduction of condensed DNA regions in the genome
and loss of ubiquitylation of histone H2A at satellite repeats. BRCA1 binds to satellite DNA
regions in vivo and ubiquitylates H2A in vitro. Ectopic expression of an H2A fused to ubiquitin
reverses the effects of BRCA1 loss, suggesting that BRCA1 maintains heterochromatin structure
via ubiquitylation of histone H2A. Satellite DNA derepression was also observed mouse and
human BRCA1 deficient breast cancers. Ectopic expression of satellite DNA can phenocopy
BRCA1 loss in centrosome amplification, cell cycle checkpoint defects, DNA damage and
genomic instability. We propose that the role of BRCA1 in maintaining global heterochromatin
integrity accounts for many of its tumor suppressor functions.
Breast cancer susceptibility gene1 (BRCA1) was identified as a hereditary cancer
susceptibility gene which increased1 risk for the development of breast and ovarian cancer in
BRCA1 mutation carriers to as high as 95% by age 702. The BRCA1 protein contains a
RING finger domain in the N-terminus with ubiquitin E3 ligase activity and two BRCT
repeats in the C-terminus3. BRCA1 is highly expressed in proliferative cells and its loss

leads most prominently to genetic instability and growth arrest. These observations have
implicated BRCA1 in a multitude of disparate cellular functions, including DNA damage
repair, cell cycle checkpoint activation, transcriptional regulation, DNA replication,
centrosome function, X inactivation, among others4. Presently no unifying mechanistic
framework exists to tie the reported biochemical activities of BRCA1 to its tumor suppressor
function3.

Heterochromatic centers in BRCA1 KO cells

Author Manuscript

High levels of BRCA1 expression have been found in the embryonic neuroectoderm5, the
postnatal cerebellum6 and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the adult brain, which
are the sites of embryonal and adult neurogenesis, respectively. We initially set out to study
the contribution of BRCA1 to neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation through targeted deletion
of BRCA1 in nestin-expressing NSCs (Supplementary Fig. 1a). As expected, the levels of
BRCA1 protein and RNA are significantly reduced in the brains of BRCA1 KO mice (Figs.1a
and Supplementary Fig. 1b). To characterize the mutant brains, we performed microarray
analyses and found evidence of altered epigenetic regulation in the absence of BRCA1 as
some imprinted genes are deregulated (Supplementary Table 1). Most notably, upregulation
of both Igf2 and H19 expression has been verified by quantitative RT-PCR experiments
using cortical RNA samples (Fig. 2a).

Heterochromatic centers are highly condensed regions of heterochromatin with repetitive
tandem DNA, which can be visualized by DAPI staining. In neurons these centers are
particularly prominent. We analyzed the nuclei of the mutant brains by DAPI staining and
found a marked reduction in the number of heterochromatic foci in the cell, especially in the
perinuclear region, when compared to control cortices (4.88 foci/cell to 1.99 foci/cell)
(Student’s t-test, p<0.0005) (Fig. 1b). Moreover, the size of the heterochromatic foci
appeared to be larger and diffuse in mutant brains. These observations suggest a defective
heterochromatic structure in BRCA1-deficient cells. To study the nature of this defect, we
stained the nuclei of cortical cells with heterochromatin protein (HP1)7, a bona fide
pericentric heterochromatin associated protein, and found that HP1 localized to
heterochromatic centers. The number of HP1-positive foci in mutant cortices was decreased
from 2.86 foci/cell to 2.13 foci/cell (Student’s t-test, p<0.0005) (Fig. 1c, top row and
Supplementary Fig. 1c, left panel). Moreover, immunoblotting of cerebellar samples showed
that the protein levels of all three HP1 protein isoforms (HP1α, β and γ) were severely
reduced in KO animals compared to controls (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The repressive
histone H1 also displayed aberrant staining and was more diffuse in BRCA1 mutant cortices
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). Other previously characterized repressive histones, such as Macro
H2A1 and heterochromatin markers, such as histone H3 dimethyl Lys 9, did not appear to be
affected by BRCA1 KO (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Since we have previously shown that the
BRCA1 protein preferentially mono-ubiquitinates histone H2A in vitro through its Nterminal RING finger8, we investigated whether BRCA1 is involved in heterochromatin
formation through histone H2A ubiquitylation. We found that the staining of monoubiquitylated histone H2A, which has recently been implicated in polycomb-mediated
silencing9, corresponded to the heterochromatic centers described in Fig. 1b and that the
staining signal was reduced in BRCA1 mutant brains (Fig.1c bottom row and Supplementary

Fig.1c right panel). We verified the cell autonomous nature of our observations using
cultured embryonic neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in vitro. Ten days after neuronal
differentiation, the BRCA1-deficient cells displayed a significant reduction in the number of
heterochromatic centers (7.85 foci/cell vs 5.00 foci/cell, Student’s t-test, p<0.0005)
(Supplementary Fig. 2c). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that cells lacking
BRCA1 are impaired in the organization of heterochromatin structure.

Heterochromatic silencing disruption

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To ascertain that the observed heterochromatic structural deficiencies are of functional
importance, we investigated the transcriptional status of known silenced genes. Defects are
expected to result in derepression of normally silenced genes in heterochromatic regions10.
The murine pericentric heterochromatin consists of stretches of highly repetitive DNA
elements, including the major and minor satellite repeats, which make up ~3% and ~0.45%
of the mouse genome respectively11. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments showed that the
levels of minor and major satellite transcripts were elevated 10.2-fold and 27.3-fold,
respectively, in the BRCA1 mutant cortices, indicating a loss of repression in constitutive
heterochromatin (Fig. 2a). Other interspersed repetitive elements such as IAP1, SINE1 and
the L1 LINE element were largely unaffected. This effect was cell autonomous as it was
observed in vitro in cultured embryonic NPCs (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The defects in
heterochromatic repression in BRCA1-deficient mouse cells could be reversed by reexpression of human BRCA1 using a lentiviral vector (Fig. 2b). Heterochromatin repression
by BRCA1 is not unique to neural cells because deletion of BRCA1 in fibroblasts from P7
mouse ribcages also showed upregulation of both satellite transcripts (Supplementary Fig.
3b). Since BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer we next generated mice harboring a
mammary gland specific deletion of BRCA1 and analyzed the integrity of heterochromatin
by qRT-PCR (Fig. 2c). The result demonstrated that lack of BRCA1 in mammary glands
from 6-week old virgin females, disrupted heterochromatic satellite DNA silencing as well
as imprinted H19 epigenetic regulation, consistent with our findings in BRCA1 null brains
(Fig. 2a).

Author Manuscript

The silencing of constitutive heterochromatin by BRCA1 is also not limited to mouse cells,
as satellite transcripts from human HeLa cells were upregulated upon expression of an
shRNA targeting BRCA1 (Supplementary Fig. 4a). Similarly, reconstitution of the human
BRCA1-deficient cell line, HCC1937, with a retrovirus expressing wildtype BRCA1
repressed the expression of satellite DNA transcripts about 20-fold (Fig. 2d). To determine
whether the N-terminal RING domain of BRCA1 is important for the heterochromatic
silencing function, we reconstituted HCC1937 cells with either a pathogenic BRCA1 mutant
devoid of ubiquitin ligase activity (T37R, known to confer increased cancer risk) or a
polymorphic variant (V11A, indistinguishable from wildtype). The T37R mutant BRCA1
failed to repress satellite transcripts whereas the V11A repressed the satellite transcripts to
an extent similar to wildtype BRCA1 (Fig. 2d). The lack of repressive activity was not due to
reduced binding of BARD1, the natural heterodimeric partner of BRCA1, as both
polymorphic and mutant immunoprecipitated BARD1 similarly (Supplementary Fig. 4b). To
further verify the involvement of the E3-ligase activity of BRCA1, we assessed the effects of
BARD1 knockdown on satellite DNA transcription since the heterodimerization between

BRCA1 and BARD1 is required for the optimal E3 ligase activity8,12. Expression of an
shRNA against BARD1 elevated the satellite DNA transcription in the BRCA1 reconstituted
HCC1937 cells but not in the HCC1937 cells where BRCA1 is absent and the satellite repeat
transcription is already derepressed (Supplementary Fig. 4c). These results from cultured
human cells are consistent with data obtained from the BRCA1 deficient mouse brains,
fibroblasts and mammary glands in which satellite DNA transcript induction was observed.
Moreover, it appears that ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of BRCA1 is essential for its role in
gene silencing in constitutive heterochromatin.

BRCA1 and heterochromatin relationship

Author Manuscript

To gain a mechanistic insight into the role of BRCA1 in maintaining heterochromatin
structure, we first investigated if BRCA1 directly associates with the constitutive
heterochromatic region in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments showed
that BRCA1 was indeed enriched on major and minor satellite DNA (Fig. 2e) in mouse cells
and on various α satellite sequences in HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig. 4d).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We next tested whether BRCA1 influenced histone ubiquitylation in vivo. The results of
ChIP experiments showed that ubiquitylated histone H2A was enriched in both major and
minor satellite regions when compared with a histone H3 antibody (Fig. 2f). However, this
satellite region enrichment was abrogated in the absence of BRCA1, indicating that BRCA1
integrity is essential for the accumulation of ubiquityl-histone H2A at satellite repeats in
vivo. Our data also show that ubiquityl-histone H2A is enriched at the satellite regions of the
mouse genome to a greater extent than at other interspersed repeats such as LINE1 (data not
shown) suggestive of a distinct heterochromatin. If BRCA1 is indeed the ubiquitin ligase for
pericentric heterochromatic histone H2A, it would imply that the integrity of the RING
finger is required for the accumulation of ubiquitylated histone H2A at satellite repeats, as
we have shown that the same region is critical for transcriptional silencing in the
heterochromatin (Fig. 2d). To test this hypothesis, ChIP experiments were performed using
HCC1937 cells reconstituted with BRCA1-T37R, BRCA1-V11A, or GFP (Fig. 2g). The
T37R mutant BRCA1 failed to significantly enrich ubiquitylated histone H2A at satellite
regions, in a manner similar to GFP control, while the polymorphic BRCA1-V11A showed
enrichment of ubiquitylated histone H2A within the same regions. A distinct mutant I26A
which has been reported to not destabilize the BARD1 interaction but has no ubiquityl ligase
activity13 fails to complement the loss of BRCA1 (Supplementary Fig. 5). The ubiquityl
ligase function of BRCA1 appears to be specific as deletion of Ring1B or knockdown of
RNF8 fail to appreciably derepress satellite transcription (Supplementary Fig. 6). These
findings provide further evidence that the BRCA1 ubiquitin ligase activity is essential for the
maintenance of the ubiquityl histone H2A mark within constitutive heterochromatic regions
not only in mouse tissue but also human cells derived from breast cancers.

Ubiquitylated histone H2A rescues BRCA1
To assess the contribution of ubiquityl-histone H2A to the function of BRCA1 in
heterochromatic silencing we generated a lentiviral vector construct expressing an H2A-Ub
fusion protein that mimics the natural ubiquityl histone H2A (Fig. 3a). This was

accomplished by fusing a single ubiquitin moiety to the C-terminus of histone H2A in lieu
of the modification of lysine 119. Subnuclear fractionation of cells expressing this fusion
protein shows that the H2A-Ub protein and mutants can be incorporated into cellular
chromatin (Supplementary Fig. 7). BRCA1 deficient HCC1937 cells were transduced with
lentivirus expressing the H2A-Ub fusion protein. Quantification of the levels of satellite
DNA transcription showed that the H2A-Ub expression can re-establish silencing of the
satellite repeats (mcBox, SATa and SATIII) within heterochromatin in BRCA1-deficient
human cells, suggesting that mono-ubiquityl-H2A is likely to be the main target of BRCA1
ubiquitin E3 ligase that mediates silencing at constitutive heterochromatin (Fig. 3b). Ectopic
expression of H2A-Ub (Supplementary Fig. 8) in murine NPCs restored the levels of
satellite DNA silencing to more than 90% of endogenous wildtype silencing (Fig. 3c).
Mutations within the ubiquitin domain of the fusion protein reduced the ability to restore
silencing of the H2A-Ub fusion protein (Supplementary Fig. 9a). H2A-Ub expression in
wild type cells had no significant effect on the satellite DNA transcription. To inquire
whether the ubiquitylation of histone H2A affected previously well-documented BRCA1
functions, we tested if the restored satellite DNA silencing in BRCA1 null cells had any of
the expected consequences. It has been reported that primary BRCA1 null cells display a
severe growth defect and p53-activated apoptosis and that p53 inactivation largely rescues
the growth defect14. By performing BrdU incorporation assays, we found that ectopic
expression of H2A-Ub led to a restoration of over 75% of proliferation in BRCA1 deficient
cells, only slightly lower than a p53 knockdown (Fig. 3d). Again, in this case expression of
H2A-Ub bypassed the requirement for BRCA1. It is worthy to note that although p53 is able
to rescue the proliferative defect of BRCA1 deficient cells, it does not rescue the formation
of heterochromatic centers, or the derepression of satellite transcripts (Supplementary Fig.
10). We also evaluated the ability of H2A-Ub to suppress apoptosis. Staining for an
apoptotic marker, active caspase3, showed a similar result (Fig. 3e) to what was seen for
BrdU incorporation or transcriptional silencing. Thus H2A-Ub can suppress the apoptosis
induced by the loss of BRCA1. Taken together, ectopic expression of H2A-Ub not only
restored silencing but also rescued the proliferative defect and apoptosis of BRCA1 deficient
cells. This rescue of the proliferative capacity of H2A-Ub is specific for the ubiquitylation
modification, as mutations within the ubiquitin domain can abrogate the effect
(Supplementary Figs. 9b and 9c). Homologous recombination, another reported cellular
process in which BRCA1 has been implicated, can also be rescued by ectopic H2A-Ub
expression in the absence of BRCA1, whereas the same protein with a triple point mutation
within the ubiquitin domain is unable to complement (Supplementary Fig. 11). Thus, monoubiquityl-H2A is likely the principal target of BRCA1 for maintaining heterochromatin
integrity in vivo.

Heterochromatin and BRCA1 tumor suppression
We next investigated the significance of heterochromatin function in BRCA1 mediated
tumor suppression. Mouse breast tumors (Fig. 4a) were harvested from animals where
BRCA1 was deleted in the mammary gland (also shown in Fig. 2c). Analyses by qRT-PCR
showed disrupted satellite DNA silencing in BRCA1 deficient mouse mammary tumors, but
not in tissues where BRCA1 is intact (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, we analyzed satellite transcripts

in human breast tumors derived from eight individual BRCA1 mutation carriers and found
significant derepression of the expression of alpha satellite repeats: CFXr and SATa (two of
human alpha satellite DNA sequences; Fig. 4c). The differences are apparent, even without
normalizing for any other factors (e.g. the percentage of non-tumor cell contamination), in
comparison with a cohort of normal breast biopsies.

Satellite transcript induced genomic instability

Author Manuscript

To investigate whether the observed satellite DNA derepression in mouse and human breast
cancers is either an epiphenomenon or of etiological significance for the genesis of cancer,
we ectopically expressed satellite DNA from a transduced lentiviral vector (Fig. 5a) in
cultured primary human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). These cells increased
abnormal mitotic figures, including bridged and lagging chromosomes and disorganized
metaphases shown by DAPI staining (Figs. 5b and supplementary Fig.12).
Immunofluorescence staining of pericentrin and tubulin revealed amplified centrosomes, as
previously described in BRCA1 null cells (Fig. 5c). Cells overexpressing satellite RNA also
displayed numerous foci of γH2Ax (Fig. 5d), a well-established marker of DNA double
strand breaks. This mirrors the phenotype of BRCA1 deficient cells. Flow cytometric
analyses showed an impaired mitotic spindle checkpoint when cells overexpressing satellite
DNA were treated with nocodazole (Fig. 5e), which has also been reported as a BRCA1 loss
phenotype15. Just as expected, ectopic expression of satellite RNA was able to create a
deficiency in homologous recombination similar in magnitude to the knockdown of BRCA1
(Supplementary Fig.13). Importantly, the cellular defects associated with satellite RNA
overexpression are generally considered leading causes for genomic instability.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The present work shows that BRCA1 deficiency impairs the integrity of constitutive
heterochromatin which leads to the disruption of gene silencing at the tandemly repeated
DNA regions, probably through the loss of ubiquitination of histone H2A. BRCA1/BARD1
proteins preferentially mono-ubiquitylate H2A at high stoichiometry8, which comprises
5-15% of the total cellular nucleosomal histone H2A16. BRCA1 accumulates H2A-Ub at
satellite DNA regions, which encompass ~3.45% of the mouse genome11 (Fig. 2f) and itself
localizes there by ChIP experiments (Fig. 2e). The BRCA1 RING domain is essential for
both satellite DNA binding and silencing. BARD1 is also required for repression of satellite
repeats and loss of BARD1 is of no consequence if BRCA1 is already absent (Supplementary
Fig. 4c). Although the exact function is not well understood, the emerging notion is that
mono-ubiquitinated histone H2A is most frequently associated with transcriptionally
repressive states9,17,18. Other ubiquityl ligases: Ring1A/B, of the polycomb repressive
complex 1 (PRC1), and RNF8, a DNA repair ligase19,20 ubiquitylate H2A but do not
contribute to the silencing of satellite repeats (Supplementary Fig. 6). Similarly, BAP1, a
known BRCA1 binding protein, has been shown to antagonize the polycomb complex by
deubiquitinating histone H2A21,22. Since a mimic of natural ubiquityl-H2A can rescue the
most prominent BRCA1 deficiency defects, it suggests that ubiquitylation of histone H2A is
likely to be the primary substrate of BRCA1 (Figs. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 9).

It is worth noting that overexpression of the satellite transcripts in the presence of wildtype
BRCA1 partially phenocopies BRCA1 loss (Fig. 5), including centrosome amplification and
γH2Ax foci formation. These observations suggest constitutive heterochromatin formation
prevents DNA damage or a DNA damage response. The function of satellite transcripts is
largely unknown. However, it has been known that the integrity of centromeric
heterochromatin requires an unknown RNA component7 that could conceivably be satellite
transcripts.

Tumor suppression by BRCA1 was presumed to occur via homologous recombination3.
Recent work showed that cells expressing a mutant BRCA1 devoid of E3 ligase activity do
not exhibit defects in homologous recombination13. Thus, the defect in genomic instability
in BRCA1 null cells seems not to require this function although an intact RING domain is
required for recovery from gamma irradiation23. Nevertheless, mutations that compromise
the ubiquityl ligase activity of BRCA1 are cancer predisposing and constitute hotspots of
mutational occurrences in patients23. Our work shows that satellite DNA repression indeed
requires an intact BRCA1 RING domain, consistent with satellite DNA derepression
observed in BRCA1 tumors (Fig. 2d). Indeed satellite transcripts in clinical BRCA1 patient
tumors are upregulated (Fig. 4c). Since satellite transcripts when expressed ectopically can
induce centrosome amplification, cell cycle check point defect and the DNA damage
response, it fulfills the criteria to be a main effector of BRCA1 mediated tumorigenesis.
Although it is presently unclear how these processes are elicited at a mechanistic level it is
tempting to speculate that histone H2A ubiquitylation pathways are involved. Alternatively,
the derepression of satellite might be elicited by some indirect “global effect” in trans that
would not require H2A-Ub to be at the derepressed site. It is conceivable that induction of
satellite transcripts could be developed into a marker of loss of heterozygosity for clinical
diagnostic application. Recent work has shown that a variety of epithelial cancers
overexpress satellite repeats that encompass up to 50% of cellular transcripts24. Although
the pathological significance of this finding is unknown, our work suggests that these could
contribute to the evolution of the cancer cell through the induction of genomic instability
(Supplementary Fig. 14).

Methods Summary

Author Manuscript

Cell culture, virus infection, quantitative RT-PCR and ChIP experiments. Primary neural
progenitor cells were isolated from adult mice containing one BRCA1 null allele and one
floxed BRCA1 allele as described25. Embryonic neural progenitors were isolated and
cultured as described26. Cultured cells were infected with retroviruses with an MOI of 5 for
12-h and harvested at the time indicated in corresponding figure legends. Cells were
harvested with TRIZOL for RNA extraction. Reverse transcription was carried out using
SuperScript III First-strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). The quantitation of PCR products
was analyzed with SYBR Green using ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection system
software (Applied Biosystems). Crosslinking and ChIP were performed as a modified
version of a protocol described by the Clevers laboratory27 and supplementary information.

Figure 1. BRCA1 deficiency impairs heterochromatin structure

Author Manuscript

a, Expression of BRCA1 is diminished in the Nestin-Cre BRCA1 knockout brains as shown
by immunoblotting. KO: samples from a P7 BRCA1 KO (Brca11+/-;Brca5-13cK+/-;nestinCre+) mouse. CTRL: samples from a control P7 (Brca11+/-; Brca5-13cK+/-; nestin-Cre-).
BRCA1 immunoblot (upper panel), tubulin loading control (lower panel). b, Lack of
BRCA1 induces changes in the nuclear morphology of P7 KO cortical cells. The numbers of
strong DAPI staining nuclear foci/cell were counted and their frequencies plotted (right
panel). c, Confocal microscopic images of brain sections from BRCA1 conditional KO and
control mice (P7) stained with antibodies against HP1 and ubiquitin-H2A (UbH2A).

Figure 2. BRCA1 and its ubiquitin E3 ligase activity are required for gene silencing in
constitutive heterochromatin

Author Manuscript

a, Quantitative RT-PCR showed that heterochromatic regions or certain imprinted genes
(Igf2 & H19 but not Igf2R) were upregulated in BRCA1 KO brains. Internal controls:
cyclophilin or 18SRNA. b, Rescue of the BRCA1 mediated repression in NPCs by exogenous
human BRCA1 but not GFP after infection with retroviral CRE-GFP. c, Quantitative RTPCR experiments showed that heterochromatic regions or imprinted genes were upregulated
in BRCA1 KO mammary glands (6-week virgin). d, The ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of
BRCA1 is required for heterochromatin silencing. HCC1937 cells were reconstituted with
either wild type BRCA1 (HCCB1) or BRCA1 with a mutation in the RING domain, T37R23.

as a control and (f) ubiquityl-histone H2A or histone H3 protein as a control. Enrichment of
major and minor satellite DNA was measured by quantitative PCR relative to 18S control. g,
ChIP experiments were performed using ubiquitinated histone H2A antibody as in (f) and
HCC1937 cells reconstituted with GFP, BRCA1 (V11A) or a mutant (T37R). Error bars are
shown as s.d. Each result shown is representative of three independent experiments.

Figure 3. Ubiquitinated histone H2A is directly involved in BRCA1 mediated heterochromatic
silencing

Author Manuscript

a, A diagram showing the artificial ubiquitin-H2A expression vector. b, HCC1937 cells
were infected with a lentiviral vector expressing ubiquitylated histone H2A mimic fusion
protein or GFP as a control and the levels of alpha satellite variants (mcBox, SATa and
SATIII) transcription were measured by qRT-PCR. c, Ectopic expression of ubiquitylated
histone H2A re-established heterochromatin silencing in BRCA1 null NPCs. NPCs were
infected with GFP alone, ubH2A, CRE-GFP alone and CRE-GFP coinfected with UbH2A.
The levels of satellite DNA transcription were measured by qRT-PCR. d, NPCs showed
increased proliferation upon expression of ubiquitylated histone H2A in BRCA1 null NPCs.
Two days after infection (2 dpi), cells were labeled with BrdU prior to fixation,
immunostaining and FACS analysis. Result shown is representative of 3 independent
experiments. e, NPCs showed reduced apoptosis upon expression of ubiquitylated histone
H2A in BRCA1 null NPCs. NPCs were cultured and infected as in (d). Cells were fixed,
immunostained with anti-activated caspase 3 antibody and subjected to confocal imaging.
Error bars are shown as s.d. Scale bar: 100 μm

Figure 4. Derepression of satellite DNA transcription occurs in BRCA1-deficient breast cancers

Author Manuscript

a, Haematoxylin/eosin staining of BRCA1KO mouse breast cancer. Because BRCA1 KO
female mice develop mammary tumors very rarely, these mice were crossed into a p53
heterozygous background for accelerated tumorigenesis. MG, mammary gland from normal
mouse littermates. MGT, mammary tumors from BRCA1KO mouse
(Brca11+/-;Brca5-13cK+/-;MMTV-Cre+;p53+/-) developed at 6 months. b, Quantitative
RT-PCR experiments showed that heterochromatic regions and imprinted genes were
upregulated in mouse BRCA1 KO breast cancer in comparison to that of wildtype mammary
glands from littermates (internal control 18SRNA). The result shown is an aggregate of 5
mouse independent sample pairs. c, Quantitative RT-PCR experiments showed the satellite
DNA transcripts, CFXr and SATa, significantly derepressed (Student’s 2-tailed t-test) in
human BRCA1-mutant breast tumors (n=8) in comparison with that of normal breast tissues
(n=11) . Ct values of each sample were normalized with GAPDH. Error bars are shown as
s.d.

sequence (red arrows) under the H1 promoter (gray arrow). b, c, d, Overexpression of
satellite RNA induced mitotic catastrophe (b), centrosome amplification (c), histone γH2Ax
phosphorylation (d), in primary HMECs. e, Defective mitotic checkpoints induced by
satellite DNA overexpression. 48h after transduction of a lentivirus expressing human
satellite DNA sequence with forward direction (human satellite F), or with reverse direction
(human satellite R), or mouse satellite DNA sequence, or an empty vector, U-2OS cells were
blocked with thymidine, followed by treatment of nocodazole. The cells were stained with
phosho-histone H3 antibody and PI prior to flow cytometric analysis. The shown experiment
is representative of 3 independent replicates.
