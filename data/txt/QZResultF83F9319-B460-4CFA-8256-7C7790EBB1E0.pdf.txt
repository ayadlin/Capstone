ABSTRACT
In order to clarify the risk of hematotoxicity of carboplatin, we inspected
19901 case reports of non-small cell lung cancer patients that were
submitted to the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between
January 2004 and December 2015. These comprised 3907 cases which were
treated with carboplatin and 15994 cases which were treated with other
therapies in the absence of carboplatin. By comparison, carboplatin cases
were significantly more likely to report anemia (OR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.85-2.78,
P = 5.04×10-15), neutropenia (OR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.76-2.92, P = 2.39×10-10),
and thrombocytopenia (OR = 2.38, 95% CI 1.84-3.08, P = 5.60×10-11). We
further explored published evidences and found 205 human genes interacting
with carboplatin. Functional analysis corroborated that these genes were
significantly enriched in the biochemical pathway of hematopoietic cell
lineage (adjusted P = 6.02×10-11). This indicated that carboplatin could
profoundly affect the development of blood cells. Given the early awareness
of the hematologic risks, great caution should be exercised in prescribing
carboplatin to non-small cell lung cancer patients. And functional enrichment
analysis on carboplatin-related genes warranted subsequent research with
regard to the underlying toxicological mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION

the cell growth of normal tissues may also be affected by
carboplatin [3]. As a result, serious adverse effects occur
in the course of carboplatin-based chemotherapy. For
example, the FDA-approved drug label [4] and a series
of clinical studies [5, 6] have warned of the association
between carboplatin and hematotoxicity, including
anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (the deficiency
of erythrocytes, neutrophils and platelets, respectively).

As a platinum coordination compound, carboplatin
is broadly used as a chemotherapeutic agent to treat
various types of cancer, such as non-small cell lung
cancer [1]. Carboplatin interferes with DNA repair, so as
to suppress and eventually kill cancer cells [2]. However,

RESULTS

However, it should be noticed that hematotoxicity
is not exclusive to carboplatin. As common hematologic
complications of chemotherapy, anemia, neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia have been widely observed in cancer
patients treated with various drugs [7-9]. Although noncomparative studies have reported on the safety risks of
carboplatin, there is still an urgent need for comparative
case-control study to directly compare carboplatin with
other anticancer therapies. If the incidence of hematologic
disorders is relatively lower among carboplatin cases,
there will be good reasons to reassess the safety profile
of carboplatin. Otherwise, if carboplatin is significantly
more likely to induce hematotoxicity, this drug must be
used even more carefully. Such information will provide
important references for clinicians to improve drug
selection and drug dosing for the treatment of non-small
cell lung cancer.
Such comparative study requires adverse event
data of large samples, which is one of the major
advantages of FDA post-market safety monitoring [10].
FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) is a
post-market surveillance system built up by US FDA to
monitor the safety risks of approved drug products. Drug
adverse events are spontaneously reported by healthcare
professionals and patients to FAERS. Every report is
described with a series of indexes of clinical information,
including the disease(s) the patient had, the drug(s)
used by the patient and the adverse reaction(s) that were
observed. According to these indexes, a set of reports
with certain characteristics can be extracted for analysis.
Apart from drug safety surveillance of FDA, FAERS
also supported a great deal of academic research on drug
safety and development in recent years [11-13]. Given the
increasingly extensive application of FAERS data, FDA
launched the openFDA initiative (https://open.fda.gov/)
in June 2014, which enabled researchers to efficiently
download and preprocess computer-readable information
[14]. In that way, the reporting rate of a certain adverse
effect can be compared between different drugs.
The present study aimed to determine whether
there were differences in hematologic risks between the
cases treated with carboplatin and those not exposed to
carboplatin. We inspected adverse event reports of nonsmall cell lung cancer patients that were submitted to
the FAERS between January 2004 and December 2015.
The results showed that hematologic adverse events
were significantly more reported among carboplatin
cases. In addition, we explored published evidences and
found a set of human genes interacting with carboplatin.
Functional enrichment analysis on these genes explained
the potential toxicological mechanisms of carboplatininduced hematotoxicity.

Pooled Analysis of hematotoxicity adverse events
The current meta-analysis on hematotoxicity
involved a total of 19901 adverse events of non-small cell
lung cancer patients, which were comprised of 3907 cases
exposed to carboplatin and 5994 controls treated with
other therapies in the absence of carboplatin. For each
year between 2004 and 2015, a reporting odds ratio (ROR)
[15] regarding hematologic adverse events was calculated
by comparing the carboplatin cases with the controls (see
Materials and Methods). And the meta-analysis pooling
individual RORs together led to an overall estimate.
We performed χ2-based Q test and calculated
2
I statistics to examine the heterogeneity underlying
the FAERS reports of different years [16]. There was
significant heterogeneity for anemia, neutropenia
and thrombocytopenia (Table 1), which justified the
random-effects model for meta-analysis (see Materials
and Methods). Overall, significantly higher risks of
hematotoxicity were observed in carboplatin cases (Figure
1). Carboplatin was more often reported for anemia
(pooled ROR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.85-2.78, P = 5.04×1015
), neutropenia (pooled ROR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.76-2.92,
P = 2.39×10-10), and thrombocytopenia (pooled ROR
= 2.38, 95% CI 1.84-3.08, P = 5.60×10-11). Funnel plot
was generated and Egger’s linear regression test [17] was
performed to evaluate the reporting bias of adverse events
(see Materials and Methods). The shape of funnel plot did
not reveal any evidence of detectable asymmetry (Figure
2) and suggested the absence of reporting bias. Leaveone-out sensitivity analyses (i.e., a single year in the metaanalysis was deleted each time to observe the influence on
the value of pooled ROR) showed that the lower bounds of
95% CI of ROR were constantly higher than 1.00 (data not
shown). These tests corroborated that the positive results
were reliable and robust.

Analysis on genes interacting with carboplatin
It is a well-known fact that drug effects on human
body work through the interaction between the drug
molecule and various genes/proteins [18]. Therefore,
adequate exploration of drug-gene relation can greatly
facilitate understanding the toxicological mechanisms
of carboplatin-induced hematotoxicity. To address this
need, we searched the Drug2Gene knowledge base
[19] and efficiently identified a set of 205 human genes
interacting with carboplatin (Supplementary Data S1).
The relation between each of these genes and carboplatin
was supported by published and/or experimentally tested
evidences derived from 23 source databases (see Materials

explain the therapeutic and adverse effects of carboplatin.
To interpret the biological functions of this gene set, we
further queried the WebGestalt (WEB-based GEne SeT
AnaLysis Toolkit) online server [20] and performed
enrichment analysis for the KEGG pathways [21] (see
Materials and Methods; Table 2 and Supplementary Data
S2). First, compared with the background distribution

in non-small cell lung cancer and other types of cancer,
suggesting that the drug-gene relation data could
effectively characterize the mechanism of action of
carboplatin. Besides, we considered non-cancer pathways
and found strong perturbations in hematopoietic cell
lineage, i.e., the development progresses of various blood
cells (Supplementary Data S3). Carboplatin was found
to interact with a number of genes encoding cytokine
(CSF2, CSF3, EPO, IL11, IL3, IL6 and TNF), cytokine
receptor (IL6R), ligand of tyrosine-kinase receptor

(KITLG) and cell-surface glycoprotein (CD44), which
played fundamental roles in the formation of erythrocytes,
neutrophils and platelets (Figure 3). While only 88
genes in human genome belonged to the pathway of
hematopoietic cell lineage, 10 out of the 205 carboplatinrelated genes fell in the category. Such a significant
enrichment (enrichment ratio = 24.02, adjusted P =
6.02×10-11) showed that carboplatin profoundly affect the
development of blood cells by interrupting certain key
genes.

be reasonable to further investigate carboplatin-induced
hematotoxicity in other pathological conditions. Another
concern is the varying quality of spontaneous reports in
FAERS and the confounding effects in data analysis (e.g.,
age, comorbidities, and prior treatment history) [33],
which requires further research based on different clinical
samples.
Chemotherapy-induced hematotoxicity is mainly
relieved with either transfusion of blood cells or
administration of hematopoietic growth factors [34].
However, without fully understanding the underlying
toxicological mechanisms, that can only fix the symptom
rather than the root cause. Therefore, understanding
the toxicology of carboplatin as the basis of prevention
is an important research priority. Based on the druggene relation information from public databases, we
investigated a set of 205 human genes interacting with
carboplatin, some of which belonged to the KEGG
pathway of hematopoietic cell lineage. For example,
proteins encoded by CSF2 and CSF3 have been used
experimentally and clinically to treat chemotherapyinduced myelosuppression [35, 36]. And interleukins
have been proved to be associated with hematologic
complications [37, 38]. These evidences supported the
notion of explaining drug action by the biological functions
of drug-related genes [39]. Therefore, other carboplatinrelated genes involved in hematopoietic cell lineage may
provide new research routes with regard to the underlying
toxicological mechanisms of carboplatin, such as finding
polymorphisms associated with hematotoxicity [40] and
differential gene expression involved in hematopoietic
lineage [41]. Experimental validation of these genes will
be required to further elucidate the roles they play in the
hematologic context.
In summary, hematological adverse events were
significantly more reported by carboplatin cases than
controls receiving other anticancer therapies, suggesting
that great caution should be exercised in prescribing
carboplatin to non-small cell lung cancer patients. This
result had implications for clinical management of cancer
patients and prophylaxis of hematotoxicity. And the genes
interacting with carboplatin were found to be significantly
enriched in the biochemical pathway of hematopoietic
cell lineage, which warranted subsequent toxicological
research.

DISCUSSION
Anticancer chemotherapies frequently induce bone
marrow suppression and consequent deficiency of blood
cells in cancer patients [22]. In some cases, the deficiency
of blood cells may lead to life-threatening outcomes, such
as severe infections [23] and bleeding disorders [24].
Furthermore, cancer patients affected by chemotherapyinduced hematotoxicity are usually subject to a substantial
economic burden in terms of medical costs [25]. To address
these problems, there is an urgent need to identify risk
factors, such as the drugs more liable to hematotoxicity
and the genes involved in the toxicological mechanisms.
The main objective of the present study was to elucidate
the comparative hematologic risks of carboplatin and to
find clues to the toxicology of carboplatin.
As a derivative of anticancer drug cisplatin,
carboplatin gained increasing acceptance in clinical
treatment for reduced non-hematologic toxicity [1]. On
the other hand, carboplatin was observed with greater
risk of bone marrow suppression than cisplatin [26].
However, there has been a long lack of large-scale casecontrol studies that directly compare the hematologic
risks between carboplatin treatment and non-carboplatin
anticancer therapies. Here we retrieved large samples
of non-small cell lung cancer patients from FAERS,
which enabled more efficient detection of safety signals.
The result demonstrated that carboplatin cases were
significantly more likely to report anemia, neutropenia
and thrombocytopenia than non-carboplatin controls.
Early awareness of the hematologic risks of carboplatin
will facilitate a rational clinical management of cancer
patients [27]. As in many studies on post-market
safety data, some caveats still need to be considered.
For example, dose reduction is a common practice in
chemotherapy for cancer treatment to control the risk
of toxicity [28, 29]. However, due to the spontaneous
nature of FAERS reports, detailed information about
drug dosage could not be guaranteed in many records.
We therefore expect subsequent research to investigate
how the dosage factor [30] may influence carboplatininduced hematotoxicity. In addition, carboplatin is used
to treat not only non-small cell lung cancer but also many
other types of cancer [31, 32]. Given the adverse events
observed in non-small cell lung cancer patients, it should

with the whole research team. 19901 adverse events of
non-small cell lung cancer patients submitted between
2004 and 2015 were extracted by searching in the drug
indication index for “NON-SMALL CELL LUNG
CANCER”. Among these adverse events, those related
to carboplatin were specified with the drug generic name
“CARBOPLATIN”. All reported adverse events in FAERS
were coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities (MedDRA) terminology (http://www.meddra.

drug. By searching in the compound name index for
‘carboplatin’ and in the organism name index for ‘Homo
sapiens’, a set of 205 human genes were found to interact
with carboplatin’. Then, the gene set was input into the
WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt,
http://bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/) to perform
hypergeometric test and evaluate the enrichment for the
KEGG pathways. As multiple pathways were tested at
the same time, the p-values of enrichment were adjusted
using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Pathways with
adjusted P-value < 0.01 were selected due to statistically
significant enrichment.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

We examined the association between the
carboplatin and hematotoxicity. For each year between
2004 and 2015, a two-by-two contingency table was
constructed, in which subjects were classified by
carboplatin exposure (exposed or not exposed) and
hematologic adverse effect (reported or not reported).
Reporting odds ratio (ROR) and its 95% confidence
interval (95% CI) were calculated to assess the strength
of the association. An ROR significantly greater than 1.00
indicated a higher risk of hematotoxicity for carboplatin.
Then, the data of different years were pooled
together to estimate the overall ROR. Such a meta-analysis
was performed with the ‘metafor’ package (https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/metafor/) of R software. The
heterogeneity between different years was assessed
with the χ2-based Q test, and a P-value < 0.05 indicated
significant heterogeneity. Meanwhile, I2 = 100% × (Q df)/Q) was calculated as another statistics to measure the
proportion of total heterogeneity contributed by betweenyear variation. When significant heterogeneity was
observed, the pooled ROR was calculated by a randomeffects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method).
Otherwise, a fixed-effects model (the Mantel-Haenszel
method) was selected.
Additionally, in case of bias that may be introduced
in the process of reporting adverse events, we used the
funnel plot to assess the validity of meta-analysis. The
asymmetry of funnel plot was assessed with Egger’s
linear regression test. A statistically significant asymmetry
(P-value < 0.05) was considered as reporting bias.
