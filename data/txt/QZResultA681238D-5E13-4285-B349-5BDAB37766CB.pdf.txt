ABSTRACT
The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and its phosphorylation are
considered essential for oncotransformation, but it is unclear whether cancer cells
require PDHC to be functional or silenced. We used specific inhibition of PDHC by
synthetic structural analogs of pyruvate to resolve this question. With isolated and
intramitochondrial PDHC, acetyl phosphinate (AcPH, KiAcPH = 0.1 μM) was a much more
potent competitive inhibitor than the methyl ester of acetyl phosphonate (AcPMe, KiAcPMe
= 40 μM). When preincubated with the complex, AcPH also irreversibly inactivated
PDHC. Pyruvate prevented, but did not reverse the inactivation. The pyruvate analogs
did not significantly inhibit other 2-oxo acid dehydrogenases. Different cell lines were
exposed to the inhibitors and a membrane-permeable precursor of AcPMe, dimethyl
acetyl phosphonate, which did not inhibit isolated PDHC. Using an ATP-based assay,
dependence of cellular viability on the concentration of the pyruvate analogs was
followed. The highest toxicity of the membrane-permeable precursor suggested
that the cellular action of charged AcPH and AcPMe requires monocarboxylate
transporters. The relevant cell-specific transcripts extracted from Gene Expression
Omnibus database indicated that cell lines with higher expression of monocarboxylate
transporters and PDHC components were more sensitive to the PDHC inhibitors. Prior
to a detectable antiproliferative action, AcPH significantly changed metabolic profiles
of the investigated glioblastoma cell lines. We conclude that catalytic transformation
of pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase is essential for the metabolism and viability
of glioblastoma cell lines, although metabolic heterogeneity causes different cellular
sensitivities and/or abilities to cope with PDHC inhibition.

P-analogs of 2-oxo acids to their cognate ThDP-dependent
dehydrogenases are due to the formation of tightly
bound transition state analog complexes after adduction
of the P-analogs to the active site ThDP. Given the
highly specific structure of enzymatic transition states,
which differ also in the mechanistically similar ThDPdependent 2-oxo acid dehydrogenases and decarboxylases,
the binding of P-analogs is able to discriminate even
close family members. The P-analogs of 2-oxoglutarate
or pyruvate have also been shown to have orders of
magnitude lower affinities to non-cognate dehydrogenases
or non-ThDP-dependent enzymes (reviewed in [1]).
Hence, selective inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase
(PDH) in vivo may be achieved using P-analogs of
pyruvate. Nevertheless, the potential of the P-analogs of
pyruvate for directed metabolic regulation has not been
systematically evaluated (reviewed in [1]).
Here, we use the P-analogs to resolve the
controversy regarding the functional state of PDH in
cancer cells. According to multiple reports, the PDH
complex (PDHC) and its regulation by phosphorylation
are important for oncotransformation [1–5]. However,
it is unclear whether cancer cell proliferation requires
PDH function or is, in contrast, associated with PDH
inactivation. A non-functional phosphorylated PDH is
a generally inferred hallmark of transformation [2, 3].
Indeed, increased expression of PDH kinases, which
inactivate PDH by phosphorylation, has been reported in
cancer cells, and is supposed to underlie mitochondrial
dysfunction and the Warburg effect [2, 3]. In good
accordance with this view, inhibition of PDH kinases
by dichloroacetate [6] or other inhibitors [7] activated
mitochondrial function and decreased proliferation
of cancer cells. However, in other cases, activation of
PDH kinases, leading to increased phosphorylation and
inactivation of PDH, also impaired proliferation of cancer
cells [5, 8]. Finally, highly active PDH was observed in
some tumors [9, 10].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To resolve the question of the role of PDH function
in cancer metabolism, the direct and selective inhibition
of PDH by P-analogs of pyruvate provides advantages
over the indirect action of PDH kinase effectors. Asides
from the possibility that the PDH kinase effectors may
also bind to other kinases, PDH kinase itself may have
targets other than PDH, especially in cancer cells. Besides,
interference with regulation of biological systems often
shows non-monotonous dependence [11]; therefore the
action of kinase effectors or of changed kinase expression
may depend on the original level of expression of PDH
kinases and phosphatases. All these factors may differ
in metabolically heterogeneous cancer cells compared
to non-transformed ones, leading to unsafe conclusions
regarding the functional state of PDH in cancer, discussed
above.
In this work, we characterized the action of
P-analogs of pyruvate (Fig. 1) on mammalian systems:
partially isolated enzymes (in vitro), mitochondria,
and cell lines in culture (in situ). Comparative analysis
showed that the phosphinate analog had a higher potential
to inhibit mammalian PDH, either isolated or inside
mitochondria, than the phosphonate analog. Although
the negative charge of the P-analogs is essential for
PDH inhibition, the membrane permeability of the
uncharged precursor strongly increased the inhibitory
power in cultured cells. The impact of the inhibitors
on metabolism and viability of different cell lines was
studied using metabolic profiling and cellular ATP assays.
The action of P-analogs of pyruvate revealed that PDH
function is essential for viability of different cell lines,
including those of human embryonic kidney (HEK293)
and highly malignant glioblastomas. The results expose
the P-analogs of pyruvate as promising tools to reveal
the metabolic impact of the PDH reaction in different
cells and/or metabolic settings. The identification of cellspecific vulnerability to perturbation in the PDH metabolic
checkpoint should provide important information for

shown). The time-dependent inactivation was much more
pronounced with AcPH compared to AcPMe and AcPMe2.
That is, under otherwise identical conditions, after 5 min
of PDHC preincubation in the potassium phosphate
buffer, pH 7.6, the assay at 2 mM pyruvate revealed more
than 90% activity loss in the presence of 0.5 μM AcPH,
whereas 50 μM AcPMe and AcPMe2 decreased activity
by only approximately 30% and 10%, respectively (data
not shown).
The inactivation by AcPH in the preincubation
medium was not reversed by pyruvate during the
subsequent assay. This is seen from the lack of a
detectable lag-period in the product accumulation curves
after pyruvate addition to AcPH-inactivated PDHC
(Fig. 3A). Linearity of the product accumulation curves
in the presence of AcPH or AcPMe (Figures 3A, 3B) also
indicates that no additional inactivation occurred with
either of the P-analogs after pyruvate was added to the
inhibitor-containing medium. Thus, pyruvate protects
PDHC from further inactivation by AcPH in the reaction
medium (no decrease in the reaction rate during the assay
in Fig. 3A), but cannot restore the activity already lost
during the preincubation with AcPH (no lag-period in
Fig. 3A). As a result, only negligible activity was assayed
after preincubation with AcPH, independent of the
pyruvate concentration in the reaction medium (Fig. 3C).
In contrast, competition with pyruvate was seen after

RESULTS
Study of the synthetic pyruvate analogs in vitro
The inhibition of isolated PDHC from rat heart by
different concentrations of acetyl phosphinate (AcPH)
or the mono- (AcPMe) or di- (AcPMe2) methyl esters
of acetyl phosphonate (Fig. 1) is shown in Fig. 2A. The
rate of the overall PDHC reaction was measured after
a short (1 min) preincubation of the enzyme with these
P-analogs of pyruvate. The concentration of pyruvate
(2 mM) was saturating, as indicated by published values of
KmPyr = 0.02–0.14 mM for heart PDHC under a variety of
conditions [12–14]. AcPH strongly inhibited PDHC in the
10−7–10−6 M concentration range (IC50~0.2 μM). Despite
possessing the same charge (−1), AcPMe was substantially
less inhibitory (IC50~0.6 mM under identical conditions),
and AcPMe2, which is uncharged, had little effect
(Fig. 2A). Increasing the preincubation time with AcPH
led to a further decrease in activity (Fig. 2B). Although
preincubation as such did not affect PDHC, after 5 min
preincubation with 0.15 μM AcPH more than 80% of the
PDHC activity disappeared, as assayed at 2 mM pyruvate.
This further decreased IC50 (to less than 0.1 μM, not

preincubation with AcPMe (Fig. 3D), confirming that the
inhibition is largely reversible in this case. Thus, when the
irreversible process does not dominate the decrease in PDH
activity in the presence of the P-analogs, their competition
with pyruvate at the active site is seen. However, under
the experimental set-up when competition kinetics is
compromised by an irreversible loss of PDHC activity, as
occurs upon preincubation with AcPH, a 10-fold difference
in the pyruvate concentration does not significantly affect
the final level of inhibition (Fig. 3C).
No significant tissue-specific differences in the
action of AcPH or AcPMe were revealed when PDHC

on the universal catalytic mechanism of the 2-oxo
acid dehydrogenases. We also tested the P-analogs of
pyruvate on the other members of the protein family,
the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and branched-chain
2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes (OGDHC and
BCODHC), which were isolated from liver. Preincubation
of the OGDHC or BCODHC with 0.05 mM AcPH, which
inhibited PDHC more than 80% at saturating pyruvate (Fig.
2A), did not significantly inhibit the OGDHC or BCODHC.
Even at half-saturation with 2-oxoglutarate, i.e. at 0.2 mM
2-oxoglutarate, which is comparable to the enzyme KmOG
= 0.1–0.2 mM [15–17], OGDHC was not inhibited by
0.05 mM AcPH, and increasing AcPH to 0.2 mM inhibited
OGDHC by only 20%. At 0.5 mM 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate

(Km ~ 0.02 mM [18]), BCODHC was inhibited by
approximately 20% at 0.05–0.2 mM AcPH. These results
are consistent with a high degree of AcPH specificity in
inhibiting the cognate PDHC. AcPMe did not inhibit
OGDHC or BCODHC under the same conditions.

by plotting Kmapp/Vmaxapp at several values of AcPH and
AcPMe against inhibitor concentration. The kinetic
parameters obtained in Fig. 4 are summarized in Table 1. As
expected from the data obtained with the partially isolated
PDHC, AcPH was more potent than AcPMe, Ki values
were 0.1 μM and 40 μM, respectively (Figures 4D, 4F). In
accordance with the in vitro data, the P-analogs of pyruvate
also failed to inhibit activity of the OGDHC in isolated
permeabilized mitochondria (data not shown).

Action of the synthetic pyruvate analogs in
alamethicin-permeabilized mitochondria
To better understand the action of AcPH and AcPMe
in complex biological systems, where, in particular, no
preincubation of PDHC with analogs is possible due to
the permanent presence of pyruvate, the PDHC activity
was assayed in alamethicin-permeabilized mitochondria.
In this set of experiments, inhibitors and substrate were
presented simultaneously, and the initial rates were
recorded, to allow analysis of the PDHC interaction
with inhibitors when irreversible inactivation was not
promoted (Fig. 4). Pyruvate (0.05–1 mM) was titrated at
different concentrations of AcPH (0.001–0.5 μM) or AcPMe
(10–50 μM) (Figures 4A, 4B). The reciprocal plots showed
that both inhibitors are competitive with pyruvate, since
they increased KmPyr without changing maximal velocity
(Figures 4C, 4E). Inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated

Action of synthetic pyruvate analogs in cell
cultures
The influence of the P-analogs of pyruvate on the
viability of cultured cells, measured by the luciferase assay
of cellular ATP levels, is shown in Fig. 5. The parameters
for the ATP decreases after a fixed (5 h) preincubation time
with different concentrations of P-analogs are presented
in Table 2. At lower concentrations of the inhibitors,
a slight increase in ATP levels or a delay in the ATP
response were observed. Although these deviations were
rarely statistically significant, the correlation coefficients
of non-linear regression analysis (R2, Table 2) improved
when the increase or lag phase were omitted from the

regression curves could deviate from 100% (Fig. 5), with
the increases in y0 up to 150% (Table 2) supporting a
complex kinetics of the initial response of cellular ATP
levels to the PDH inhibitors. Remarkably, the difference
between the inhibitory power of AcPH and AcPMe
upon cellular incubation with the P-analogs (Fig. 5,
Table 2) was minor compared to that observed in vitro
(Figures 2, 3) and in permeabilized mitochondria (Fig. 4,
Table 1). Moreover, all cells were strongly impaired
by the uncharged AcPMe2 (Fig. 5, Table 2), which was

inactive on the isolated enzyme (Fig. 2A). Thus, cellular
permeability of the charged P-analogs AcPH and AcPMe
could limit their intracellular inhibition of PDHC, while
uncharged membrane-permeable AcPMe2, which could
be de-esterified by intracellular enzymes, is highly
effective in cell culture.
It is also obvious from Figures 5A, 5B and
regression constants in Table 2 that the PDHC inhibitors
AcPH and AcPMe affected ATP levels more strongly in
HEK293 cell cultures than in glioblastoma cell lines.

of PDHC inhibition, these changes seem to be more
dependent on cell-specific metabolism. To compare the
metabolic profiles of the non-treated cell lines, the levels
of metabolites in the two cell lines (T98G and LN405)
were related to those in the third one (U87) used as a
reference. The resulting heat map presented in Fig. 6B
exposes the cell-specific differences in the steady-state
levels of the detected metabolites. For instance, lower
levels (blue scale) of fructose, isomaltose, mannitol
and erythritol are observed in the non-treated LN405
cells, compared to the non-treated U87 and T98G cells
(Fig. 6B). In the cells treated with AcPH, these metabolites
strongly decrease in U87 and T98G cell lines, but are not
responsive to the treatment in LN405 cell line (Fig. 6A).
Thus, original differences in cellular metabolism cause
cell-specific responses to AcPH. As a result, comparative
metabolomics indicates that all cell lines show similar
response to AcPH of pyruvate and its metabolic partners
linked through the TCA cycle (metabolites in the upper
part of Fig. 6A). However, extension of these perturbations
to other pathways, such as those defining the levels of
sugars and nucleotides (metabolites in the lower part of
Fig. 6A), occurs according to the cell-specific metabolism,
expressed in different metabolic profiles of the non-treated
cells (Fig. 6B).

especially obvious when HEK293 and U87 cell lines
were compared, and persisted also when the membranepermeable AcPMe2 was applied. The cell-specific
sensitivity to the P-analogs of pyruvate exposes the varied
metabolic impact of PDHC inhibition on viability of
different cell lines.

Action of AcPH on the cell metabolome
In the metabolomics study, we aimed to detect
the primary action of PDHC inhibition on the cellular
metabolome. Therefore, we exposed cells to a low
concentration of AcPH, which was chosen as the best
structural analog of pyruvate (Fig. 1), inhibiting PDH
at 10−7 M concentrations (Figures 2, 3) and directly,
i.e. not requiring intracellular activation. These
features of AcPH were advantageous for reproducible
metabolomics analysis of the primary changes, because
interpretation of the action of a stronger inhibitor of
cellular viability AcPMe2 would be complicated by
the time- and concentration-dependent intracellular
formation of multiple inhibitory species (AcPMe and
fully de-esterified acetyl phosphonate (AcP), Fig. 1)
from the precursor. As seen from Fig. 6A, the incubation
with 0.5 mM AcPH for 5.5 h significantly changed many
cellular metabolites in all glioblastoma cell lines, despite
no detectable changes in an ATP-based viability assay
(Fig. 5A). Obviously, the viability decrease results from
multiple primary and secondary metabolic changes, while
the metabolomics changes reflect initial perturbation due
to PDHC inhibition. As expected, pyruvate and amino
acids that are degraded through pyruvate, i.e. Ala, Gly,
Ser, Thr, were strongly accumulated, whereas the TCA
cycle intermediate citrate for which the PDHC product
acetyl-CoA is a precursor, and the citrate transformation
product 2-oxoglutarate were strongly decreased. The
lower level of 2-oxoglutarate was coupled to a strong
decrease in glutamate. The levels of fumarate and
malate were significantly decreased, while aspartate was
significantly increased in all cell lines studied. Several
other amino acids, organic acids, sugars, sugar alcohols,
AMP and nicotinamide changed in response to AcPH
(Fig. 6A). However, unlike the predictable consequences

Analysis of transcriptomics data
For three out of four cell lines tested with the PDHC
inhibitors in our experiments, the global Affymetrix gene
expression levels are available from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database. It was therefore interesting to
compare cellular sensitivity to the PDHC inhibitors with the
expression of relevant genes. Signal intensities of annotated
genes of interest, extracted from the database, are presented
in Table 3. Apart from the well-known genes for the PDHC
components (PDHA1, PDHB, DLAT, PDHX, DLD) and
its phosphorylation system (pyruvate dehydrogenase
kinases PDK1–3 and phosphatases PDP1–2) shown
in Table 3, we included in the analysis a testis-specific
isoform of PDHA, PDHA2, a regulatory subunit of the
pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, PDPR, and PDK4.
However, none of the cell cultures expressed significant

levels of mRNAs for PDHA2, PDPR and PDK4, owing to
which they were not included in Table 3. Compared to the
HEK293 cell line, glioblastoma cell lines U87 and T98G
are characterized by significantly lower expression of the
genes for the protein components and phosphorylation
system of PDHC (Table 3). Nevertheless, the ratio of the
first (PDHA1+PDHB) and second (DLAT) components of
PDHC is similar in HEK293 and T98G lines, favoring the
catalytic competence of PDHC in both lines. In contrast,
a detectable signal of mRNA for the second complex
component DLAT was repeatedly absent in different
analyses of the U87 line (Table 3), suggesting that the

overall PDHC reaction, which requires all the complex
components, is impaired in U87 cells.
Because AcPH and AcPMe (Fig. 1) are structural
analogs of pyruvate carrying the same charge (-1), they
may use and/or block the pyruvate carriers. Besides,
cellular resistance to PDHC inhibition may be affected
by the ability to extrude lactate which accumulates along
with pyruvate due to lactate dehydrogenase-catalyzed
reduction of pyruvate. Relative expression of the genes for
relevant monocarboxylate transporters and parameters of
their substrate specificity according to [19] are presented in
Tables 3 and 4, respectively. The expression data (Table 3)

show that signals of mRNA for SLC16A1 (MCT1), coding
for the major cellular monocarboxylate transporter, and the
two subunits of the hetero-oligomeric pyruvate transporter
of the inner mitochondrial membrane, MPC1 and MPC2,
are proportional to those of the rate-limiting component
of PDHC, (PDHA1+PDHB). The protein product of
the SLC16A7 (MCT2) gene is a minor carrier which is,
however, very specific for pyruvate, preferring it over lactate
(Table 4). Expression of SLC16A7 is similar in HEK293 and
T98G but much lower in U87 cells (Table 3). Expression
of highly-specific lactate transporters SLC16A8 (MCT3)
and SLC16A3 (MCT4), which prefer lactate over pyruvate
(Table 4), is pronounced in glioblastoma cell lines T98G and
U87, but not detectable in HEK293 cells (Table 3).

In the present work, using mammalian PDHC from
different tissues, we reveal that certain features of the
mechanism of action and structure-function relationship
of the inhibitors are common for pyruvate dehydrogenases
from all clades. First, the analogs compete with pyruvate
binding at the active site (Fig. 4), and the phosphinate
analog (AcPH) is orders of magnitude more potent than
the phosphonate analog with the same charge -1 (AcPMe)
(Fig. 2A, Fig. 4 and Table 1). The difference may be
due to lower steric hindrance for the ThDP reaction
with the carbonyl group near the phosphinate residue
compared to the phosphonate, and a higher effective
positive charge on the phosphorus in phosphinates than
phosphonates [1]. Second, the non-charged dimethylated
phosphonate analog, AcPMe2, inhibits poorly in vitro
(Fig. 2A). Thus, to mimic pyruvate binding to PDHC,
analogs need a negative charge. However, similar to the
phosphonate analogs of 2-oxoglutarate [25, 26], the noncharged AcPMe2 is active in cells (Fig. 5C). Obviously,
intracellular activation of this precursor by esterases forms
the charged inhibitory species AcPMe (charge -1) and AcP
(charge -2) (Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION
Mechanism of P-analog inhibition of
mammalian PDHC
Inhibition of PDHC by P-analogs of pyruvate has
been studied using bacterial and plant enzymes [20–24].

Dependence of the maximal inhibitory effect of
the most potent inhibitor, AcPH, on its preincubation
with PDHC (Fig. 2B) is the third feature of P-analog
inhibition, common for mammalian, plant and bacterial
systems. Studies on bacterial PDHC showed that during
preincubation the first inhibitory complex between AcPH
and PDH undergoes a transformation, resulting in a slowly
dissociating, yet fully reversible, binding of the inhibitor
to PDH [20, 24]. In contrast, the slow dissociation of
AcPH does not occur in mammalian PDH, since there is
no slow reactivation in reaction medium, indicating that
excess pyruvate fails to restore the activity lost during
preincubation with AcPH (Figures 2B, 3C). Only when
pyruvate is present during phosphonate binding is PDHC
protected from inactivation by AcPH (Fig. 3A), and only
then is AcPH inhibition of PDHC satisfactorily described
by reversible competition with pyruvate at the active site
of PDH (Fig. 4, Table 1). Thus, irreversible inactivation
upon preincubation with AcPH (Figures 2A, 3A, 3C),
also noted for commercial PDHC from bovine heart
[22], distinguishes mammalian PDHC from the bacterial
enzyme [20, 24]. Due to the irreversible inactivation,
mammalian PDHC is much more sensitive to AcPH
(nearly complete inhibition after 5 min at 10−7 M, Figures
2B, 3C) than the bacterial enzyme (only 50% inhibition
after 10 min at 10−7 M [20]). Species-specific irreversible
effects of the phosphonate analogs of other 2-oxo acids
include dilution-resistant inhibition of plant OGDHC
by phosphonate analogs of 2-oxoglutarate [27, 28] and
irreversible inactivation of benzoylformate decarboxylase
by a phosphonate analog of benzoylformate, where the C-P
bond of the bound phosphonate breaks, phosphorylating
the active site serine [29]. An analogous mechanism of
AcPH-dependent phosphorylation of the active site of
PDH may irreversibly inactivate mammalian PDHC,
where a serine residue near the pyruvate-binding site is
phosphorylated by PDH kinase 1, inactivating PDH.
The phosphorylation and pyruvate binding are mutually
exclusive [30–33], as are the AcPH-induced inactivation
and pyruvate binding (see above). Unlike mammalian
PDH, the bacterial enzyme has no phosphorylatable
serine residue near the pyruvate binding site and is not
inactivated by regulatory phosphorylation. The data may
explain the irreversible action of AcPH on mammalian
(Figures 2B, 3A, 3C), but not bacterial [20] PDHC,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

favoring the AcPH-dependent phosphorylation of the
mammalian PDH active site.
Earlier in vitro tests of interactions of the pyruvate
P-analogs with other pyruvate-transforming enzymes
indicated that binding of P-analogs to aminotransferases
and lactate dehydrogenase is weak and unlikely
to contribute to the action of the analogs at in vivo
concentrations of pyruvate [1]. Nevertheless, the small size
of AcPH and AcPMe could allow their accommodation
in the active sites of 2-oxo acid dehydrogenases other
than PDH, such as 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and
branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase, which form
tight inhibitory complexes with the P-analogs of their
specific substrates. However, we showed that, compared
to the PDHC inhibition, OGDHC or BCODHC were
inhibited insignificantly (≤ 20%) even at orders of
magnitude higher concentrations of the P-analogs of
pyruvate. Thus, our data strongly support selective binding
of the P-analogs of pyruvate to PDHC in vivo.

Comparison of inhibition by P-analogs in vitro
and in situ
Whereas the IC50 of AcPH and AcPMe was about
3000-fold different with partially isolated PDHC even
after a short (1 min) preincubation with inhibitors
(Fig. 2A), in the pyruvate-containing milieu in situ the
difference decreased to 400-fold for intramitochondrial
PDHC (Ki, Table 1) and 1.5-fold for intracellular PDHC
(k, Table 2).The relative effectiveness of AcPMe2 was
also different in vitro and in situ. Able to penetrate the cell
membrane without a carrier, uncharged AcPMe2 was the
strongest inhibitor of cellular viability (Table 2, Fig. 5),
although it did not inhibit PDH in vitro (Fig. 2A). Similar to
other esterified pro-drugs, AcPMe2 obviously gives rise to
the active charged species after intracellular transformation
by esterases. Thus, in addition to the pyruvate-induced
protection from the irreversible inactivation of PDHC by
AcPH, the similar potency of AcPH and AcPMe in cells
is obviously due to limited intracellular delivery of these
negatively charged inhibitors. Our analysis of expression
of the carriers that transport pyruvate into the cell and the
mitochondrial matrix (Tables 3, 4) revealed correlations
with the sensitivities to the P-analogs of pyruvate. As
seen from Table 3, the major transporters of pyruvate
40045

DLAT (Table 3), suggests impairment in the overall PDHC
reaction in these cells, because DLAT is required for the
complex assembly and DLAT-mediated catalysis [38, 39].
Decreased function of PDHC in U87 cells agrees with a
lower decrease in U87 viability upon PDHC inhibition
(Fig. 5), compared to T98G and HEK293 cells expressing
the full set of the PDHC enzymatic components.
However, AcPH significantly changes the metabolic
profile even in U87 cells (Fig. 6A), and the membranepermeable AcPMe2 strongly decreases the U87 viability
(Fig. 5C). These findings suggest that some of the PDHCcatalyzed reactions that do not require DLAT and usually
are considered as non-physiological side reactions may
be important for U87 viability. An example of such a
reaction is formation of acetoin, which is catalyzed by
PDH, and greatly increases in some tumors [9, 10]. Thus,
varied cellular sensitivity to inhibitors of PDHC (Fig. 5)
correlates with different cellular expression of PDHC
components (Table 3). The metabolic heterogeneity of
glioblastoma cells in regard to oxidative decarboxylation
of pyruvate is supported by varied transcript levels of
the PDHC components and related transporters (Table 3)
and different metabolic profiles of these cells (Fig. 6B).
For example, significantly lower levels of most of the
TCA cycle-degraded amino acids and citrate in T98G
cells compared to U87 cells suggest different regulation
of the PDHC junction to the TCA cycle in these cells,
extended to the differences in metabolism of sugars
(fructose, mannitol, erythritol) and other metabolites
(AMP, nicotinamide).
The data obtained in this (Figures 5, 6A) and other
[40] studies indicate that cell viability, as measured by
ATP levels, decreased at much higher concentrations of
the inhibitors (Fig. 5) and/or longer inhibition time [40]
than needed to induce significant metabolic perturbation
(Fig. 6A, [40]). Moreover, metabolic responses of cells
to lower concentrations of damaging factors are not
adequately reflected by decreases in ATP levels, as
such factors may increase ATP levels. When cytotoxic
necrotizing factor 1 acted on intestinal cells, ATP
increased concomitant with elevation of oxidative
phosphorylation [41]. Upon cellular exposure to metabolic
inhibitors, a decrease in cellular ATP levels was preceded
by a significant increase when OGDHC was inhibited in
cultured neurons [40] and in our experiments on PDHC
inhibition (Fig. 5, Table 2), which showed simultaneous
decreases in AMP levels by metabolic profiling (Fig.
6A). Along with the high (approximately 90%) level of
adenine nucleotide phosphorylation in the resting state
[42, 43], the observed increases in ATP (Fig. 5), decreases
in AMP (Fig. 6A) and disturbed nucleic acid maintenance
[40] in the metabolically challenged cells suggest that
the ATP increases in the perturbed cells reflect changes
in the adenine nucleotide pool size. If changes in cellular
ATP levels are indicators of general destabilization of
metabolism due to drug-induced metabolic changes, ATP

into cells (SLC16A1) and mitochondria (MPC1+MPC2)
are expressed proportionally to the PDH subunits
(PDHA1+PDHB), suggesting expression to be a measure
of the physiologically linked processes of pyruvate influx
and degradation. Lower expression of SLC16A7 in U87
versus HEK293 and T98G (Table 3) agrees with a lower
sensitivity of U87 to AcPH and AcPMe, compared to
HEK293 and T98G (Fig. 5, Table 2). In view of lactate
accumulation upon PDHC inhibition, the ability of cancer
cells to extrude lactate faster through higher expression of
SLC16A8, aided by SLC16A3 in U87 cells (Table 3), may
also contribute to the higher resistance to the P-analogs of
the glioblastoma vs HEK293 cell lines (Fig. 5, Table 2).
Note that our metabolic profiling did not consistently
detect lactate in glioblastoma cell lines. The undetectable
level of this metabolite, including in cells treated with
AcPH, where pyruvate and alanine are accumulated
(Fig. 6A), suggests rapid lactate extrusion. As a result,
the presence of pyruvate protecting from irreversible
inactivation by AcPH, the uptake of the P-analogs and
lactate export may contribute to the different relative
sensitivities of isolated (Fig. 2A) and cellular (Fig. 5)
PDHC to AcPH, AcPMe and AcPMe2.

AcPH and AcPMe as tools to understand
metabolic transformation in cancer
The functional state of PDHC in cancer is a matter
of controversy. On one hand, PDHC is supposed to be
down-regulated in cancer due to phosphorylation [2]. This
is supported by several findings. For instance, the transactivation of the gene for PDH kinase isoform 1 (PDK1)
by HIF-1 is induced in hypoxia [34]; the phosphorylationinduced activation of PDK1 by oncogenic mitochondrial
Tyr kinases is under the control of tumor regulators
Myc and HIF-1 [35], and an inhibitor of PDH kinase,
dichloroacetate, negatively affects tumor growth, which
correlates with PDH activation [6, 36, 37]. However,
as mentioned in the Introduction, in other studies,
proliferation of cancer cells was impaired concomitant
with activation of PDH kinases [5, 8].
Our analysis of expression of PDHC components
(Table 3) revealed that highly malignant glioblastoma
cells (U87 and T98G) had lower expression of PDHC
than immortalized, but benign HEK293 cells, which is
in accordance with a lower impact of PDHC inhibitors
on cellular viability in U87 and T98G vs HEK293 cells
(Fig. 5, Table 2). Remarkably, however, except for DLAT
in U87 cells, all other catalytic and regulatory components
of PDHC as well as pyruvate transporters are expressed at
similar ratios in HEK293 and glioblastoma cells (Table 3).
The expression suggests a functional significance of
PDHC, which agrees with the effects of the PDH inhibitors
on the viability indicator ATP and metabolic profiles
of the glioblastoma cells (Figures 5, 6). Undetectable
expression in U87 cells of the core component of PDHC,

levels may not only decrease, but also increase (Fig. 5)
during initial damage.
Our data on the response of different cell lines to
PDH inhibitors (Figures 5, 6) clearly show that PDH is not
disabled, but important for the viability of glioblastoma
cells. Genetic background of the cell-specific metabolism
is an important factor potentially contributing to the
different cellular sensitivity to PDH inhibitors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Synthesis of pyruvate analogs
Sodium acetylphosphinate was synthesized
according to [21]. Phosphinic acid (50 wt.% in H2O)
(6.6 ml, 50 mmol) was evaporated at 1 mm Hg at ambient
temperature to remove water. Triethyl orthoacetate
(18.84 g, 21.3 ml, 116 mmol) was added dropwise under
argon. Dry HCl was passed through the solution under
vigorous stirring until it became cloudy. The reaction
mixture was stirred overnight at ambient temperature
under argon, followed by evaporation at 1 mm Hg to
remove volatiles. NaOH (3 g, 75 mmol) in 40 ml degassed
water was added dropwise at 0°C under argon. The
resulting solution was refluxed under argon for 2 h. After
cooling, the pH was adjusted to 8.0 with concentrated
HCl, and the solution was evaporated to dryness. The
residue was triturated with 70 ml of boiling absolute
ethanol. After filtration ethanol was evaporated to dryness
and the residue was recrystallized from absolute ethanol.
The resulting sodium (1,1-diethoxyethyl) phosphinate
contained 6 mol% NaH2PO2 as impurity based on NMR 1H
and 31P spectra: NMR 1H (400 MHz, D2O), δ, ppm: 7.06
(d, J 518.0 Hz, 2H,). NMR 31P (161.9 MHz, D2O), δ, ppm:
7.1. The yield of sodium (1,1-diethoxyethyl)phosphinate
was 22%, m.p. 182–185°C. NMR 1H (400 MHz, D2O),
δ, ppm: 6.89 (d, J 515.9 Hz, 1H, HP), 3.74 (q, J 7.1 Hz,
4H, OCH2CH3), 1.41 (d, J 11.0 Hz, 3H, CCH3), 1.22 (t, J
7.1 Hz, 6H, OCH2CH3); NMR 13C (100.6 MHz, D2O),
δ, ppm: 100.8 (d, J 144.1 Hz, CCH3), 57.9 (d, J 6.8 Hz,
OCH2CH3), 17.4 (d, J 11.0 Hz, CCH3), 14.6 (OCH2CH3);
NMR 31P (161.9 MHz, D2O), δ, ppm: 21.5.
Sodium (1,1-diethoxyethyl)phosphinate (1 g,
4.9 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of 9.5 ml glacial
acetic acid and 0.5 ml water. The solution was stirred at
ambient temperature for 24 h. The solvent was evaporated
to dryness; the residue was triturated with 30 ml of
acetone and filtered off to give sodium acetylphosphinate
as a white solid. At this step, the yield was 96%, with the
final compound containing 6 mol% NaH2PO2 as impurity
(based on NMR 1H and 31P spectra). NMR spectra
showed that a solution of sodium acetylphosphinate in
D2O contains up to 30% sodium (1,1-dihydroxyethyl)

Enzyme purification
PDHC was partially purified from heart or liver
of Wistar rats by modifications of published procedures
[46–48]. The tissues were stored frozen at −70°C. Except
where indicated, purification was at 4°C, and the pH of
the buffers was adjusted at room temperature. The buffers
were then cooled to 4°C.
PDHC from heart was isolated using ~8 g of
tissue, cut in pieces with scissors and homogenized in
1.5 volumes of isolation buffer A, comprising 0.03 M
HEPES, 1 mM EDTA, 0.15 M KCl, 3 mM dithiothreitol
(DTT), 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF),
1 mM AEBSF, 0.8 μM aprotinin, 50 μM bestatin,
20 μM leupeptin and 10 μM pepstatin pH 7.4. An IKA
homogenizer at maximum velocity was used to disperse
the tissue, followed by several strokes in a PotterElvehjem homogenizer. The homogenate was diluted
2 times with isolation buffer A containing 1% (v/v)
Triton X-100 then centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 g.

2 months without significant loss of activity.
OGDHC and BCODHC were also partially purified
from rat livers stored frozen at −70°C, by a modification
of a published method [48]. Frozen tissue (~40 g) was
cut in pieces with scissors and homogenized in one

2.7 mM EDTA, 1 mM benzamidinium chloride and 1 mM
PMSF, pH 7.0, in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The
homogenate was diluted with one volume of isolation
buffer D containing 6% (v/v) Triton X-100, and pH was
adjusted to 6.8. The homogenate was centrifuged for
20 min at 10,000 g. The pellet was resuspended in one
volume of isolation buffer D and centrifuged as above.
Combined supernatants were filtered through four layers
of cheesecloth and adjusted to pH 6.45 with 10% (v/v)
acetic acid followed by addition of 0.12 volumes of 35%
(w/v) PEG-6000. After stirring for 30 min, the suspension
was centrifuged for 20 min at 18,500 g. The pellet was
dissolved in 100 ml isolation buffer D and adjusted
to pH 6.8 with 5 M NaOH at 20°C. Insoluble material
was removed by centrifugation at 18,500 g for 30 min at
20°C. The supernatant was filtered from fat and left at 4°C
overnight. Next morning the supernatant was adjusted to
pH 7.0 and 1 M MgCl2 was added to a final concentration
of 13 mM. The supernatant was incubated on a water
bath at 30°C for 5 min. After cooling, cytochalasin D was
added to 1 μg/ml. The ionic strength was increased by
addition of 1 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate, pH 6.3,
to 50 mM. The pH was adjusted to 6.45 with 10% (v/v)
acetic acid followed by addition of 0.12 volumes of 35%

benzamidinium chloride, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM leupeptin, 20 μM AEBSF and 1%
(v/v) Triton X-100, pH 7.0. The suspension was adjusted
to pH 6.8 with 5M NaOH at 20°C. Insoluble material was
removed by centrifugation at 18,500 g for 40 min and
supernatant containing PDHC, OGDHC and BCODHC
was stored at −20°C for 3 months without significant loss
of OGDHC activity.
Overall reactions of partially purified PDHC,
OGDHC and BCODHC were tested spectrophotometrically
at 340 nm by NADH production as specified in the figure
legends.

Mitochondrial isolation and permeabilization
5–10 week old female Wistar rats were from Charles
River Laboratories fed chow ad libitum and with free
access to water. Mitochondria were isolated from hind
limb skeletal muscle at 4°C in Chappell-Perry buffer
(CP1; 50 mM Tris, 100 mM KCl and 2 mM EGTA,
pH 7.4 at 4°C) by standard procedures [49] and kept on
ice until used. Protein was measured by the biuret method.
The animal protocol was approved by the Buck Institute
Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with
IACUC standards. Mitochondria were permeabilized
according to [50]. Briefly, intact mitochondria (35  mg
mitochondrial protein/ml) were diluted 20-fold in 10 mM
HEPES, 0.25 M sucrose, 0.2 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCl2,
40 μg/ml alamethicin, and 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine
serum albumin, pH 7.4 at 25°C, and incubated for 5 min at
room temperature. The suspension was diluted 2.5-fold in
the same buffer lacking MgCl2, alamethicin and albumin,
then centrifuged at 30,000 g for 15 min. The permeabilized
mitochondria were resuspended in ice-cold 10 mM
HEPES, 0.25 M sucrose and 0.2 mM EGTA, pH 7.4 at
4°C, and stored on ice until use. Protein was redetermined
using the same method.

Mitochondrial PDHC and OGDHC activity
NADH fluorescence was measured according to
[51] in a 96-well Pherastar microplate reader at λexcitation =
340 nm, λemission = 460 nm. Permeabilized mitochondria
(0.1 mg mitochondrial protein/ml) were suspended at 37°C
in 180 μl of 3 mM HEPES, 120 mM KCl, 1 mM EGTA,
5 mM KH2PO4, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.3% (w/v) fatty acid-free
bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4 at 37°C, containing 0.3
mM ThDP, 0.9 mM CaCl2, 4 μM rotenone, 0.2 mM NAD+
and 0.14 mM CoASH. Total Ca2+ values were calculated
using the software MaxChelator [52] to give 10 μM
targeted free Ca2+. Reaction was started by pipetting the
suspension described above into a plate previously loaded
with different concentrations of pyruvate and pyruvate
analogs shown in Fig. 4. OGDHC-dependent NADH

production was measured titrating different concentrations
of 2-oxoglutarate (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 1 mM) over the same
concentration of AcPH and AcPMe as in the PDH reaction
(Fig. 4). Data on inhibition by AcPH and AcPMe were
obtained using two separate mitochondrial preparations,
with each activity point corresponding to a mean ± SEM
of 3–6 technical replicates. There was a lag of ~ 0.5–1 min
between loading the plate and starting the run. After that,
the rate over the first minute was used to calculate the rate
of NADH reduction. In control wells (without inhibitors)
all NAD+ was reduced to NADH after 15–20 min, and the
difference between initial and final fluorescence was used
to calibrate the scale.

GSE1923 (experiments GSM34592, GSM34593 and
GSM34594) and GSE53014 (experiments GSM1280363,
GSM1280365, GSM1280374 and GSM1280376).
Fluorescence signals, which are backgroundcorrected, scaled (normalized) and statistically analyzed
by different algorithms (MAS 5.0, RMA or Limma), were
extracted from the GEO database. Most of the data (series
GSE50547, GSE1822, GSE8537, GSE1692, GSE35169,
GSE9200 and GSE1923) were processed using the modern
Affymetrix algorithm Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS
5.0). MAS 5.0 defines the signal for gene i as the anti-log
of the robust average (Tukey’s biweight) of Eq 1:

Cellular studies

where PMij is the signal intensity values in the
“perfect match” cells. CTij is defined as a quantity equal to
“mismatch” (MM) values when MMij < PMij, but adjusted
to be less then MM when PMij » PMij.
The Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) algorithm
was used in older Affymetrix platforms. It does not use the
“mismatch” values and summarizes the “perfect match”
values using the median polish function. This method of
data processing was used in series GSE1364, GSE1455
and GSE4218. Linear Models for Microarray Data
(Limma) was used for processing the data from Agilent
platforms (series GSE53014).
To compare different experiments, the processed
fluorescence signals for the complete annotated genes
of interest were extracted from GEO and normalized to
the averaged mRNA levels of GAPDH, ACTB and STAT1
in the same experiment. The median and SEM of these
normalized values from n reported experiments were
estimated.

HEK293 and human glioblastoma cell lines
LN405, T98G, U87 were obtained from the American
Type Culture collection (LGC Standards GmbH; Wesel,
Germany). Cells at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/ml, 200 μl
per well, were seeded on microplates (Greiner, μClear,
black clear bottom) in DMEM (4.5 g/L glucose, 10% FCS,
2 mM Glutamax, containing antibiotics). Medium was
exchanged 24 h later for 100 μl per well of Hanks’ solution
(HBSS) (1 g/L glucose, 0.37 M NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl,
0.25 mM Na2HPO4, 0.44 mM KH2PO4, 1.3 mM CaCl2,
1.0 mM MgSO4, 4.2 mM NaHCO3). P-analogs of pyruvate
were added at different concentrations (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 10
and 20 mM). 5 h later ATP levels were determined using
the CellTiterGlo assay system (Promega, Heidelberg,
Germany) according to manufacturer’s recommendations
as described previously [40]. Concentration dependence
data were obtained by averaging luminescence from six
wells, and % of the ATP levels in the treated vs control
cells were used to characterize the effects of the analogs
on cellular viability.

Metabolic profiling
Cells were grown on Petri dishes for 24 h. After
changing the cellular growth medium to glucosesupplemented HBSS, 0.5 mM AcPH was added and cells
were incubated for 5.5 h. Metabolic profiling was performed
essentially as in [40]. Briefly, metabolites were extracted
in 2 ml ice-cold methanol containing 0.05 mM ribitol as
internal standard for the relative quantification of metabolite
abundance [54]. After centrifugation, the supernatant was
collected and stored frozen before the analyses. The pellet
was used for protein quantification as in [55]. Samples were
derivatized as in [54]. GC-MS metabolite determinations
were normalized to ribitol level and protein content (μg).
For the heat map visualisation normalized values were
Log(2)-transformed and the heat map was created using
MultiExperiment Viewer (MeV®) software [56].

Transcriptomics data analysis
To estimate the relative expression of different
PDHC components, cellular monocarboxylate carriers
(SLC16 family) and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier
in relevant cells, we extracted the data on expression
of proteins of interest from global mRNA expression
experiments in the NCBI GEO database [53]. The
expression in HEK293 cell line was from series
GSE50547 (experiments GSM1221013, GSM1221014
and GSM1221015), GSE1822 (experiments GSM31805
and GSM31806), GSE1364 (experiments GSM22069,
GSM22070 and GSM22071) and GSE1455 (experiments
GSM24493, GSM24494 and GSM24495), in T98G cell
line – from series GSE8537 (experiment GSM211868),
GSE1692 (experiments GSM29233, GSM29234 and
GSM29235) and GSE4218 (experiments GSM96274,
GSM96275 and GSM96276) and in U87 cell line – from
series GSE35169 (experiments GSM862922, GSM862923
and GSM862924, GSE9200 (experiment GSM231724),
