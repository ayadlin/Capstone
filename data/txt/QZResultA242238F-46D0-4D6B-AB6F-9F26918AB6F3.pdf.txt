Abstract
Expression of class III β-tubulin (βIII-tubulin) correlates with tumor progression and resistance to taxanebased therapies for several human malignancies, but its use as a biomarker of tumor behavior in prostate
cancer (PCa) remains largely unexplored. Here, we describe βIII-tubulin immunohistochemical staining
patterns of prostate tumors obtained from a broad spectrum of PCa patients, some of whom subsequently
received docetaxel therapy for castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Elevated βIII-tubulin expression was significantly associated with tumor aggressiveness in PCa patients with presumed localized disease, as it was found
to be an independent marker of biochemical recurrence after treatment. Additionally, βIII-tubulin expression
in tumor cells was an independent predictor of lower overall survival for patients receiving docetaxel-based
chemotherapy for CRPC. Manipulation of βIII-tubulin expression in human PCa cell lines using a human βIIItubulin expression vector or βIII-tubulin small interfering RNA altered cell survival in response to docetaxel
treatment in a manner that supports a role for βIII-tubulin expression as a mediator of PCa cell resistance to
docetaxel therapy. Our findings suggest a role for βIII-tubulin as candidate theranostic biomarker to predict
the response to docetaxel-based chemotherapy as well as to target for treatment of docetaxel-resistant CRPC.

Introduction
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common solid malignancy and the second leading cause of death attributable to
cancer in men (1). Despite the widespread use of prostatespecific antigen (PSA) testing to screen for early-stage PCa,
men continue to be diagnosed with locally advanced or
metastatic disease, and ∼30% of newly diagnosed patients
treated with curative intent will eventually relapse during
follow-up (2). Treatments at this advanced stage usually
include androgen deprivation therapy to deplete systemic
androgens in patients, thus reducing the levels of a known

PCa growth factor. This treatment is most often only transiently effective because prostate tumor cells can progress
to a seeming androgen-independent (AI) growth phase now
diagnosed as castration-resistant PCa (CRPC; ref. 3). Once
at this stage, docetaxel-based chemotherapy has been shown
to improve, although the survival advantage is relatively limited (4, 5). At this time, several molecular markers have been
proposed to have dependent or independent utility for PCa
patient prognostic assessments (6, 7), but these latter biomarkers remain unproven. Here, we discuss our efforts to evaluate
the potential utility of class III β-tubulin for purposes of prognostication of PCa patient response to early, localized therapy
or to late-stage, taxane-based chemotherapy.
Taxanes constitute an important group of chemotherapeutic agents that specifically target the β-tubulin subunit of microtubules. By targeting microtubule activity, taxanes can
block cell mitosis and induce apoptosis, especially in tumor
cells (8). A growing body of preclinical and clinical data
now suggests that increased expression of one particular
β-tubulin isoform, class III β-tubulin (βIII-tubulin), confers
cancer cell resistance to taxanes (9–11) and that βIII-tubulin
resistance to taxanes is clinically relevant for human lung,
breast, and ovarian cancers (12). For these human malignancies, high tumor cell expression of βIII-tubulin was associated
with significantly poorer survival rates in patients treated
with taxane-based chemotherapy (13–17). For lung cancer,
one study suggested that tumor cell βIII-tubulin expression

was a prognostic factor for men who did not receive adjuvant
chemotherapy (18).
For PCa, despite evidence from in vitro studies showing
that β-tubulin isotype expression was altered in paclitaxelresistant cells, there has been only little informative clinical
data evaluating the prognostic or predictive value of βIIItubulin expression in patient tumor cells (19, 20). Previously,
we showed that expression of βIII-tubulin was increased in
CRPC and that expression of this tubulin isoform might have
a role in progression to CRPC (21). The aim of the present
study was to determine whether βIII-tubulin expression
might have prognostic value for hormone-naive PCa (HNPC)
patients treated by surgery or for CRPC patients treated with
taxane-based therapy (docetaxel). Here, we evaluated clinical
PCa specimens for expression levels of βIII-tubulin by immunohistochemistry and manipulated βIII-tubulin expression in
PCa cell lines to determine the effects of this manipulation
on in vitro responsiveness to docetaxel.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human PCa cell lines LNCaP (clone FGC), 22Rv1, and
DU145 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin.
For this study, low-passage cells were used (<20 passages).
The LNCaP-AI variant (passages 16–20) was derived from
LNCaP cultures maintained >18 months of growth in
androgen-depleted medium (phenol red–free RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped FBS). LNCaP
and 22Rv1 were authenticated through cell morphology
monitoring, response to androgen treatment, and expression
of androgen receptor (AR), which harbor mutations in these
lines (22–24). DU145 was authenticated by lack of AR expression, expression of mutant TP53 (24), and assessment of the
invasive behavior using Boyden chamber assays.
Western blot analysis
Protein lysates were prepared in the radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics) and phosphatase inhibitors
(25 mmol/L orthovanadate and 50 mmol/L NaF; SigmaAldrich). The total protein concentration of the soluble
extract was determined using the bicinchoninic acid kit
(Sigma-Aldrich). Each protein sample (30 μg) was resolved
to SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (Millipore), and incubated with a monoclonal
antibody against βIII-tubulin (1:10,000; clone TUJ1; Covance)
or β-actin (1:16,000; AC-15; Sigma-Aldrich). Primary antibodies against the other β-tubulin isotypes were from Abcam. Immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence
detection (ECL Plus kit, GE Healthcare).
cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR
Quantitative PCR was carried out using SYBR Green dye
on an Applied Biosystems 7000 Real Time PCR system. The
conditions for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) have been

described previously (25). The amount of βIII-tubulin mRNA
levels relative to the housekeeping gene ribosomal protein,
large, P0 (RPLP0) was determined on the basis of the
comparative threshold cycle CT method (2−ΔΔCT). The primer
sequences for βIII-tubulin and RPLP0 have been described
previously (25, 26).
Construction of βIII-tubulin expression vector and
generation of stable βIII-tubulin–overexpressing cells
The open reading frame (ORF) encoding βIII-tubulin was
purchased from Invitrogen (Ultimate ORF clone, clone ID
IOH3755, NM 00608.2). The βIII-tubulin ORF was provided
in the Gateway entry vector pENTR 221. The βIII-tubulin expression was constructed by recombining the βIII-tubulin
pENTR 221 into the destination vector pcDNA 3.2/V5-DEST
(Invitrogen) via the LR reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions (Gateway LR clonase II enzyme mix,
Invitrogen). The resulting vector was designated as pcDNATUBB3. LNCaP and DU145 cells were seeded at the density
of 1.5 × 105 in 100-mm culture dishes in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. The next day, cells were transfected with
4 μg of pcDNA-TUBB3 vector using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Cells were selected in geneticin (G418, 400 μg/mL) for 3 weeks.
Resistant colonies were isolated and allowed to grow as
monoclonal population. Clones expressing the different levels
of βIII-tubulin were selected, as determined by Western blot
analysis, for further studies.
Small interfering RNA transfection
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against TUBB3 and control
nontargeting siRNA were obtained from Invitrogen, Inc. Three
specific Stealth RNAi sequences were tested: TUBB3HSS115886
(5′-GACAUCUCUUCAGGCCUGACAAUUU-3′), TUBB3HS‐
S115887 (5′-GCAUCAUGAACACCUUCAGCGUCGU-3′), and
TUBB3HSS173592 (5′-CAGCUGGAGCGGAUCAGCGUCUACU3′). The nonsilencing control siRNA, which has no sequence
homology to any known human gene sequence, was used as a
control for nonsequence-specific effects in all experiments.
Subconfluent human prostate cells were transfected with
siRNA by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer's instructions. Seventy-two hours after the
transfection, the efficacy of the siRNA knockdown was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting. The optimal amount of siRNA used for transfection was determined
as being 50 nmol/L, and the best siRNA sequence allowing to
reduce >70% of βIII-tubulin expression was identified as the
sequence TUBB3HSS115887.
Docetaxel dose-response curve
To assess the effect of βIII-tubulin overexpression on chemoresistance, 1 × 104 cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter
plates. The next day, cells were treated with docetaxel
at growing concentrations for 72 hours. Cell viability was
determined by MTT assay.
To assess the effect of the combination treatment of βIIItubulin silencing plus docetaxel, 22Rv1 cells were transfected
with 50 nmol/L of Stealth siRNA against βIII-tubulin or

control vector as described above and then treated with docetaxel at various concentrations for 3 days. Cell viability was
then determined by MTT assay.
The cell survival curve was presented as the percentage of
surviving cells versus the concentration of docetaxel. The
IC 50 values were defined as the concentration of drug
required for 50% cell survival, and were calculated using a
logarithmic regression. Results were expressed as means ±
SE. Each assay was done in triplicate and repeated on three
separate experiments.
Patients and tissue samples
Written informed consent was obtained. The study included 258 patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy
for localized PCa between November 1988 and May 2007. Demographics, clinical and biological data, pathologic parameters, and outcomes in terms of PSA recurrence and
adjuvant treatment of 258 patients with HNPC were collected

www.aacrjournals.org

prospectively in a database and reviewed in a retrospective
manner. Clinical, biological, and pathologic parameters and
follow-up data are listed in Table 1. No patient had received
neoadjuvant therapy.
The study also included 37 patients with CRPC stage
and analyzable initial hormone-naive tissue who received
docetaxel-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment between January 2002 and July 2008. Demographics, clinical
and biological data, pathologic parameters, and outcomes
in terms of PSA were collected prospectively in a database
and reviewed in a retrospective manner. The mean age was
68.1 years, and the mean PSA level was 135.0 ng/mL at PCa
diagnosis. The median Gleason score was 8 at diagnosis.
Bone metastases were present in 21 patients at PCa diagnosis. Docetaxel-based chemotherapy was administered for
clinical and/or biochemical progression in patients with
CRPC after a mean duration of androgen ablation therapy
of 33.2 months. The patient's hormone-refractory status
was defined as a progressive increase in PSA level after
androgen blockade. Hormonal castration had to be biologically confirmed. Chemotherapy was combined with low-dose
orally administered prednisone.
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens were
obtained from the Department of Pathology at the Henri
Mondor Hospital (Créteil, France). Immunostaining was
performed (a) on the initial prostatic biopsies of 37 patients
who had received first-line docetaxel-based chemotherapy
and (b) on tissue microarrays (TMA) for the HNPC patient's
cohort. When considering TMAs, for each PCa case, four replicate cores (diameter, 0.6 mm) were obtained from cancer
foci and four additional cores were also taken from nonneoplastic areas as previously described (25).
Immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Materials
and Methods)
Immunostaining was done on 5-μm tissue sections
mounted on silane-coated slides. βIII-tubulin protein expression was evaluated using a monoclonal antibody specific for
the βIII-tubulin isotype (1:500; clone TUJ1).
A numerical score was assigned for the epithelial cells of
each specimen. Samples with no stained tumor cells were
scored as 0. A score of 1, 2, or 3 was assigned to samples with
weak, moderate, or strong staining, respectively, independently of the proportion of stained tumor cells. The proportion of immunostained tumor cells was also assessed. For
TMA analysis, the mean of staining in the four neoplastic
cores was considered. Only cytoplasmic staining was taken
into account. All of the slides were independently evaluated
by three observers (G. Ploussard, S. Terry, and Y. Allory).
Observers were blinded to the patients' adjuvant treatment,
final pathologic assessment, and outcome. Interrater reproducibility was 95%. Different scores were reassessed and consensus between observers was defined. Staining intensity
seen in nerves and axons served as an internal positive control. The absence of immunostaining in red cells was used as
negative control (27). Photomicrographs were taken using a
Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope (Carl Zeiss) from imaging platform (INSERM, U955, UPEC).

Statistical analysis
Null expression (0% of stained cells) and weak to strong
expression (scores 1–3 and ≥5% of stained cells) were
grouped separately as dichotomic variables for statistical
analysis.
The Student's t test was used for continuous data. The
Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used when
data were not normally distributed. Qualitative data were
tested using a χ2 or Fisher's test as appropriate. The Gleason
score was dichotomized according to the definition of highrisk PCa as follows: Gleason score <8 versus ≥8 (2). Survival
curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method and
compared using the log-rank test. The Cox proportional
hazards model was used to evaluate the independent value
of βIII-tubulin expression among commonly used prognostic
factors. Hazard ratios (HR) were presented with 95% confidence interval (CI).
In the CRPC cohort, the starting point of the analysis was
the first cycle of chemotherapy. The PSA Working Group criteria were used to evaluate PSA responses: we chose a decrease of >75% from the baseline PSA level as the criterion
for PSA response (28). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) defined as the time from the start of chemotherapy
until death from any cause or last follow-up for censored patients. Time to progression was defined as the time between
the first cycle of chemotherapy and an elevated PSA finding.
In the HNPC cohort, Biochemical recurrence-free survival
(RFS) was analyzed. The day of surgery was reported as the
starting point of analysis. Recurrence was defined as the first
detectable elevation of PSA above 0.20 ng/mL (at least two
consecutive measurements).
A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant,
and all P values were two-sided. SPSS 13.0 software was used
for statistical analyses.

Results
Prognostic value of βIII-tubulin expression for PCa
recurrence in HNPC patients treated by radical
prostatectomy
We had previously reported that βIII-tubulin was expressed significantly lower in HNPC compared with CRPC.
In our previous study, however, the small patient sample size
in the HNPC group (n = 74) prevented us from deriving any
statistically reliable association with other patient prognostic
factors (21). Here, we extended our assessment of βIIItubulin expression to PCa-containing specimens obtained
from 258 PCa patients that were treated by radical prostatectomy (Table 1). We identified βIII-tubulin expression in 43 of
the 258 specimens from patients with HNPC (16.7%; Table 2).
Strong βIII-tubulin immunostaining (score of 3.0) was detected in 6.2% of tumors. When βIII-tubulin expression was
observed, the percentage of positively stained tumor cells
showed a wide range of variability (range, 5–100%; mean,
25.8%; median, 10%). Representative examples of immunostaining are shown in Fig. 1A to C. βIII-tubulin expression
was not detected in nonmalignant prostate basal or luminal
epithelial cells adjacent to the tumor. Correlations of βIII-

tubulin immunostaining with histoprognostic parameters
are described in Table 2. We found that positive immunostaining was significantly associated with a Gleason score of
≥8 [P = 0.001; odds ratio (OR), 3.17], a primary Gleason grade
of 4 or 5 (P = 0.013; OR, 2.28), a pT stage of ≥3 (P = 0.042; OR,
1.97), an extraprostatic extension (P = 0.028; OR, 2.10), and
positive lymph nodes (P = 0.034; OR, 3.05). It is noteworthy
that βIII-tubulin expression was also significantly associated
with a high risk for biochemical recurrence (P = 0.029; OR,
2.15). The intensity of immunostaining was also correlated
with the histoprognostic parameters. A strong immunostaining, defined by a staining score of 3, was also markedly associated with a Gleason score of ≥8 (P < 0.001), extraprostatic
extension (P < 0.001), positive surgical margins (P = 0.025), pT
stage (P < 0.001), and positive lymph nodes (P = 0.043) when
compared with a null-to-moderate staining (score, 0, 1, or 2).
The 3- and 5-year RFS was 84.5% and 75.4%, respectively, in
patients with no βIII-tubulin expression in the prostate tumor. By contrast, the 3- and 5-year RFS was 72.4% and
59.4%, respectively, in patients expressing βIII-tubulin in
prostate tumor cells. The log-rank test was significant with
a P value of 0.002 (Fig. 1D). In patients with favorable pathologic features (Gleason <8, pT2 cancer, and negative surgical
margin), the 5-year RFS was 91.7% in βIII-tubulin–negative
patients versus 79.6% in βIII-tubulin–positive patients (P =
0.006). Furthermore, in multivariate analysis using a Cox
model taking into account Gleason score, pT stage, and surgical margin status, βIII-tubulin expression was an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence (P = 0.029; HR, 1.95;
95% CI, 1.07–3.55).
Increased expression of βIII-tubulin in PCa cell lines in
response to in vitro docetaxel treatment
We previously reported that βIII-tubulin expression was increased in LNCaP cells (21), which were grown in androgendepleted medium or in tumor xenografts from these cells
after castration of the host mouse. In the present work, we
tested whether docetaxel treatment could affect βIII-tubulin
expression in two AI PCa cell lines: LNCaP-AI that expresses
low levels of βIII-tubulin or 22Rv1 that endogenously expresses higher levels of βIII-tubulin. LNCaP-AI variant cells
were treated with docetaxel at 3 nmol/L for up to 30 days.
As shown in Fig. 2A, using Western blots to assess the levels
of expressed βIII-tubulin protein, expression was continuously elevated by exposure to docetaxel over the time course
of the experiment. It is noteworthy that the class II β-tubulin,
an isotype known to be predominantly expressed in the
brain, also increased along with total β-tubulin under docetaxel exposure, whereas no significant increase was seen for
βI and βIV isotypes (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S1). To corroborate these findings, we set out to further characterize the
expression of β-tubulin isotypes in 22Rv1 under exposure to
docetaxel at 15 nmol/L for 72 hours. The 22Rv1 PCa cell line
is derived from a primary tumor xenograft, CWR22, which
relapsed during androgen ablation (29). These cells express
at least three AR isoforms that seem to be constitutively active, likely promoting proliferation as well as the expression
of multiple AR-dependent genes in a ligand-independent

manner (23). Consistent with earlier observations, upregulation of βIII-tubulin protein (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S2A)
as well as mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. S2B) was evident
in docetaxel-treated 22Rv1 cells. The βII and total protein
levels were similarly increased in docetaxel-treated cells in
contrast to that found for βI and βIV isotypes. Together,
these data show that both acute and chronic exposure of AI
PCa cells to docetaxel upregulates βIII-tubulin along with a
seeming general increase of total β-tubulin.
Stable overexpression of βIII-tubulin in PCa cell lines
confers resistance to docetaxel
To assess whether overexpression of βIII-tubulin was sufficient to confer resistance to docetaxel in PCa cells, we established PCa cell clones, from LNCaP or DU145 cells, stably
expressing the human TUBB3 gene (βIII-tubulin–transfected
clones) under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter.
The AR-negative DU145 line is derived from a brain metastasis. These cells might represent a very aggressive stage of PCa

nodes are the most common and earliest sites for PCa metastasis, thus rendering this model particularly attractive for
the research community (22). Differential expression of βIIItubulin protein between control vector–transfected LNCaP
cells and βIII-tubulin-transfected clones was established by
Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C). Despite some decrease of
βII isotype was seen in βIII-tubulin–transfected LNCaP cells
(βIII-tubulin clone 1), forced expression of βIII-tubulin did
not seem to affect consistently the expression of the β-tubulin
isotypes. Interestingly, the βIII-tubulin–overexpressing
LNCaP cells had a neuroendocrine-like appearance (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that forced expression of βIIItubulin is associated with a transdifferentiation process that
has been frequently described for these cells (31, 32). To examine the effects of βIII-tubulin overexpression, we measured
the half-time inhibitory concentration (IC50) of docetaxel assessed by measuring cell viability at 72 hours after exposure.
The cell viability assays showed that βIII-tubulin–transfected

LNCaP cells (βIII-tubulin clone 1 and βIII-tubulin clone 7)
were significantly more resistant to docetaxel treatment than
control vector–transfected LNCaP cells with a 6.6-fold
increase in the IC 50 (33.1 versus 5.0 nmol/L; P < 0.001;
Fig. 2D). A significant difference between clones and control
cell survival was already achieved at 2 nmol/L docetaxel and
persisted up to 50 nmol/L docetaxel treatment (P < 0.001).
βIII-tubulin–transfected LNCaP cells were again poorly sensitive to docetaxel when higher doses were tested (Supplementary Fig. S4) Having established that βIII-tubulin has severe
implications for docetaxel resistance in LNCaP cells, we
sought to determine if this could be due in part to an effect
of βIII-tubulin on cell proliferation. To this end, cell proliferation was assayed in the absence of drug. Cell doubling times
for vector-transfected LNCaP and βIII-tubulin transfectants
were estimated at 31 and 44 hours, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). Two βIII-tubulin–transfected DU145 clones
were also selected for subsequent treatment, including one
clone expressing high levels of βIII-tubulin (clone 7) and
one clone expressing moderate βIII-tubulin (clone 5) at a level
similar to that found in parental or control vector–transfected
DU145 cells (Fig. 3A). The cell viability assays showed that
βIII-tubulin–transfected clone 7 was significantly more resistant to docetaxel treatment compared with clone 5 or control
vector–transfected DU145 cells with a 2-fold increase in IC50
(11.1 versus 5.1 nmol/L; P < 0.001; Fig. 3B). A significant
difference in cell viability between clone 7 and control cells
was already achieved at 5 nmol/L (P < 0.001). There were
no noticeable morphologic differences between the parental

9258

vector–transfected DU145 and either of the two sublines.
Nor were there any evident differences in growth rates noted
during standard passage and cell proliferation assays of the
sublines compared with the vector-transfected or parental
cells (Supplementary Table S1).
βIII-tubulin silencing increases sensitivity to docetaxel
To further ascertain a role for βIII-tubulin in chemoresistance to docetaxel, siRNAs directed against βIII-tubulin were
used to knock down endogenous βIII-tubulin expression in
22Rv1 cells. The targeting siRNA with the highest reduction
of βIII-tubulin was selected for further study based on RTPCR and Western blot analysis for effects on βIII-tubulin
mRNA and protein. βIII-tubulin mRNA levels were decreased
by 70% using this siRNA, and βIII-tubulin knockdown was confirmed by Western blot analysis after 3 and 6 days (Fig. 3C).
siRNA-mediated loss of βIII-tubulin did not seem to affect
the other βIII-tubulin isotypes (Supplementary Fig. S5). An assessment of the doubling times revealed that concomitantly
with the loss of βIII-tubulin on βIII-tubulin siRNA treatment,
there was a trend toward an increase in cell growth (Supplementary Table S1). Docetaxel was then added to the growth
medium of control cells or targeting siRNA-treated cells
72 hours after the transfection. Seventy hours later, targeting
siRNA-transfected 22Rv1 cells were found to be more sensitive
to docetaxel treatment at all doses tested compared with the
control 22Rv1 cells. Overall, βIII-tubulin siRNA-transfected
22Rv1 cells were found to be 2-fold more sensitive to docetaxel
(IC50 of 4.4 versus 8.5 nmol/L; P < 0.001; Fig. 3D) than controls.

Class III β-Tubulin and Prostate Cancer

These results indicate that βIII-tubulin silencing sensitizes AI
PCa cells to docetaxel.
Predictive value of early βIII-tubulin expression in a
docetaxel-treated patient cohort
By examining the βIII-tubulin status in the initial prostatic
biopsies of patients subsequently treated for CRPC disease
with docetaxel chemotherapy, we investigated the usefulness
of βIII-tubulin expression as a potential predictive tumor
biomarker for response to docetaxel. Of the 37 cases, 17 were
positive for βIII-tubulin (9 with moderate and 8 with strong
staining), whereas 20 were negative. Representative examples

of staining are shown in Fig. 4A and B. In this cohort, βIIItubulin expression was significantly correlated with a Gleason score of >7 at diagnosis; 29.4% of βIII-tubulin–negative
cancers were graded 8 or more compared with 63.2% of βIIItubulin–positive cancers (P = 0.043). PSA responses were observed in 52% of βIII-tubulin–negative patients compared
with 35% of βIII-tubulin–positive patients (P = 0.337). Patients with βIII-tubulin–positive tumors experienced shorter
time to progression. Median time to progression was 4.7
months in βIII-tubulin–positive patients compared with 9.8
months in βIII-tubulin–negative patients (Breslow P = 0.149;
log-rank P = 0.522).

Overall, the median survival time for the entire cohort was
25.3 months (95% CI, 16.5–34.2), and the observed cumulative
probabilities at years 1, 2, and 3 were 79.5%, 57.8%, and 43.7%,
respectively. Median OS was significantly shorter for patients
with βIII-tubulin–positive tumors than those with βIIItubulin–negative hormone-naive tumors (13.5 versus 41.6
months; P = 0.019; Fig. 4C). Finally, baseline PSA levels measured before the first cycle of chemotherapy in these patients
were also significantly related to OS. Multivariate analysis taking βIII-tubulin expression, baseline PSA, age, and duration of
androgen deprivation therapy into account showed that βIIItubulin expression (HR, 2.93; P = 0.037) and baseline PSA level
(HR, 4.09; P = 0.012) were independent predictors of OS.

Discussion
In PCa, clinical data and histoprognostic parameters, separated or integrated into nomograms, still fail at the individual
level to accurately determine the risk of biochemical or clinical
relapse after local treatment (33, 34). At CRPC stage, docetaxelbased chemotherapy has proven to have some effectiveness in
terms of overall response rates and survival in CRPC patients
(4, 5). However, any selection of patients likely to benefit most
from this form of chemotherapy is difficult and is often based simply on patient age or the presence of comorbidities in individuals.
Numerous preclinical studies have reported that the selective overexpression of βIII-tubulin constitutes an important

mechanism for resistance to tubulin-binding agents in various cancer cell lines (19, 35–38). Several clinical studies have
shown that high levels of βIII-tubulin expression in tumor
cells are associated with low response rates and poorer survival in patients treated with taxane-based chemotherapies
(13–17, 39). Our findings in PCa were consistent with
the previous studies and highlight that the expression of

www.aacrjournals.org

βIII-tubulin is associated with non-organ–confined disease,
metastatic lymph nodes, and PSA failure. Thus, tumor cell
βIII-tubulin expression might characterize a general subclass
of PCa patients with aggressive behavior and poor prognosis.
This could give reason to consider adjuvant treatments for
patients with βIII-tubulin–positive tumors.
Characteristics of our HNPC patient's cohort differed slightly from characteristics of patients who actually undergo a radical prostatectomy. The advent of PSA testing has led to a
considerable stage migration with an increase of low-risk
PCa. In our HNPC cohort study, we included patients who underwent radical prostatectomy since 1988. This constitutes a
selection bias due to a more important proportion of high-risk
PCa before the PSA era. These discrepancies may limit the
study of βIII-tubulin expression, as the number of high-risk
PCa decreases over time. However, we showed that the prognostic effect of βIII-tubulin remained significant in organconfined PCa, and therefore, we posit that the βIII-tubulin is
of additional value to well-established histoprognostic parameters even in the assessment of presumed low-risk PCa.
We also observed here that the βIII-tubulin expression in AI
PCa cell lines was increased in response to acute or chronic
exposure to docetaxel. In line with our findings, Ranganathan
and colleagues (19) previously showed an increase in βIIItubulin expression in response to paclitaxel treatment of
DU145 cells. The exact mechanism by which increased expression of βIII-tubulin mediates drug resistance remains
open to debate. In some instances, we found that alterations
of βIII-tubulin expression were associated with changes in
cell morphology and/or cell proliferation rate. Thus, there
is reason to believe that these events might be key determinants of drug resistance. Additionally, evidence is accumulating that microtubules containing βIII-tubulin exhibit an
aberrant dynamicity. These microtubules are less stable than
microtubules composed of other β-tubulin isotypes (9, 10, 40,
41). Because the primary effect of taxane is to bind microtubules, thereby enhancing the microtubule polymerization
and decreasing microtubule dynamicity, it has been suggested that βIII-tubulin–containing microtubules are more
prone to overcome the suppressive effects of taxanes on microtubule dynamics. Although it should be noted that all the
above studies (12, 13, 42) have focused on the assembly of
purified microtubules in cell-free systems and therefore remain controversial given contradictory reports obtained in
intact cells, and hence more biologically relevant, that βIIItubulin did not intrinsically affect microtubule dynamic, at
least in some instances (38, 43). Interestingly, in these last
studies, the effects of paclitaxel on microtubule dynamics
were altered, suggesting a role for βIII-tubulin in drugmicrotubule interactions. Consistent with this, Mozzetti
and colleagues (42) have reported that βIII-tubulin overexpression was the prominent mechanism of paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer patients compared with other
mechanisms of drug resistance such as overexpression of
MDR-1 and point mutations in tubulin at the binding site
of paclitaxel. Although many studies have focused on paclitaxel, such characteristics might also be pertinent for
docetaxel. Interestingly, recent reports further showed that

βIII-tubulin confers resistance to microtubule-destabilizing
agents such as vinorelbine in breast cancer cells (44). In
the setting of non–small cell lung cancer, βIII-tubulin
was shown to affect significantly the response to both
tubulin-targeting agents and DNA-damaging agents (45).
The investigators proposed that βIII-tubulin may serve as
a survival factor to rescue tumor cells from death signals
triggered by chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, it is conceivable that elevated expression of βIII-tubulin can exert
similar effects in other malignancies, including PCa, and
future work should explore this question.
Another interesting open question about anti-microtubule
drug resistance associated with changes in βIII-tubulin expression in cancer cells is: what is the contribution of other
isotypes in response to taxane-based regimens? Ranganathan
and colleagues (20) have previously noted that class IVb
β-tubulin was increased collaterally in βIII-tubulin–transfected
DU145 cells in response to paclitaxel treatment. In a separate
study, wherein paclitaxel-resistant DU145 variants were selected after chronic exposure to the drug, examination of
the β-tubulin isotype composition revealed increased expression of βIII-tubulin, but no changes were observed for IVb
β-tubulin. Instead, some increase in IVa β-tubulin expression
was noted (19). Although this previous work in DU145 has suggested that βIII-tubulin expression is upregulated in response
to paclitaxel treatment, our survey using docetaxel treatment
of two AI AR-positive PCa cells, 22Rv1 and LNCaP-AI, provides
additional evidence that this situation might be relevant in
clinical settings. These studies further indicate that expression
of the class βII tubulin can be altered in PCa cells, and highlight a potential role for this isotype in the emergence of docetaxel resistance. The ectopic overexpression or silencing of
βIII-tubulin resulted in a seeming specific upregulation or
downregulation of the βII-tubulin expression, respectively.
Surprisingly, under these conditions, we failed to find any significant changes in the expression of other β-tubulin isotypes.
These instances strengthened the role of βIII-tubulin in contributing to chemosensitivity and illustrate the importance of
monitoring the β-tubulin isotype profile to confirm the contribution of the target isotype in drug response studies. Although
previous work has suggested that manipulation of βII- and
βIVb-tubulin expression did not cause changes in paclitaxel
sensitivity of Chinese hamster ovary and lung cancer cells
(46, 47), these cell lines differ from PCa cells, and future work
is warranted to determine the full functional implications of
each β-tubulin isotype in the emergence of drug resistance
in PCa cells.
Our findings in experimental PCa cell lines were consistent
with our clinical observations that βIII-tubulin expression in
prostate tumors correlated significantly with outcomes of
docetaxel chemotherapy for CRPC patients. Patients expressing βIII-tubulin at diagnosis had reduced survival. Thus, it is
tempting to speculate that the assessment of βIII-tubulin expression could determine which CRPC patients might benefit
from taxane-based chemotherapy. Studies exploring potential molecular markers in response to chemotherapy are currently limited by the difficulty in obtaining tissues from
patients with CRPC. Many changes occur during the evolu-

9262

Cancer Res; 70(22) November 15, 2010

tion to CRPC, and cancer tissue at diagnosis does not always
reflect accurately the cancer tissue in its more advanced stage.
In fact, obtaining tumor tissue at CRPC stage, or before and
during therapy, although rarely feasible in clinical practice,
would certainly be the best way to investigate the effect of biomarker on response to therapy. Nevertheless, by examining
βIII-tubulin expression in the tumors of HNPC patients, which
are easily accessible to tumor sampling, it seems possible to
evaluate their response to docetaxel-based therapy once the
disease has progressed to CRPC. If these findings are confirmed, the use of novel tubulin-targeted agents, such as
epothilones, could be useful for βIII-tubulin–positive PCa patients (11, 48, 49). This might also offer the opportunity for
therapeutic intervention by an anti–βIII-tubulin treatment
in such patients.
Collectively, our results suggest that the functional and
clinical biomarker aspects of βIII-tubulin expression are
linked. Consistent with our previous findings and other studies reporting an increase in the βIII-tubulin isotype as a
result of anti-microtubule drug treatments (19, 20, 50), it
seems likely that adjuvant treatments other than the current
taxane-based chemotherapy regimen may be required for
this group of patients. More importantly, our results now
support the idea that βIII-tubulin expression may be linked
to multiple forms of PCa: progression to recurrence in HNPC
patients, progression to CRPC in hormone-treated patients,
and, finally, progression to docetaxel resistance in docetaxeltreated CRPC patients. In the area of cancer treatment,
clinicians have to deal with two limitations: the difficulty
to predict accurately the relapse after local treatment, and
the ability to anticipate ineffective adjuvant or systemic therapy. To date, in PCa, new molecular markers are needed to
better define the subset of patients who are most likely to
benefit from an adjuvant strategy after radical treatment,
and from chemotherapy at CRPC stage. Our findings were
consistent with the role of βIII-tubulin expression as prognostic marker of biochemical recurrence at HNPC stage. Assessment of the βIII-tubulin expression in cancer tissue
therefore could be useful to identify and monitor PCa at high
risk for recurrence after radical prostatectomy. If longer
follow-up and rates of specific mortality confirm these results,
the βIII-tubulin expression might be interesting for predicting recurrence rates and for proposing adjuvant therapy.
Functional overexpression or knockdown of βIII-tubulin
modulates the PCa cell line sensitivity to docetaxel. The tissue βIII-tubulin expression status also has predictive value in
terms of OS in patients receiving docetaxel-based chemotherapy for hormone-independent disease. These findings
underline the importance of βIII-tubulin expression, which
could be used in addition to clinicopathologic characteristics
to select patients for docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Prospective studies incorporating βIII-tubulin immunohistochemistry are warranted to determine the clinical relevance
of routine use of this assay.
