BACKGROUND: Tasisulam sodium (hereafter referred to as tasisulam) is a novel, highly albumin-bound agent that demonstrated activity in a phase 2 melanoma study. METHODS: In this open-label phase 3 study, patients with AJCC stage IV melanoma received tasisulam (targeting an albumin-corrected exposure of 1200-6400 h (hour).lg=mL on day 1) or paclitaxel (80 mg=m2 on days 1, 8, and
15) every 28 days as second-line treatment. RESULTS: The study was placed on clinical hold after randomization of 336 patients
when a safety review indicated an imbalance of possibly drug-related deaths in the tasisulam arm. Efficacy results for tasisulam versus paclitaxel revealed a response rate of 3.0% versus 4.8%, a median progression-free survival of 1.94 months versus 2.14 months
(P 5.048), and a median overall survival of 6.77 months versus 9.36 months (P 5.121). The most common drug-related grade 3 laboratory toxicities (graded according to Common Terminology for Adverse Events [version 3.0]) were thrombocytopenia (18.9%) for
patients treated with tasisulam and neutropenia=leukopenia (8.7%) among those receiving paclitaxel. There were 13 possibly related
deaths reported to occur on the study, with the majority occurring during cycle 2 in the setting of grade 4 myelosuppression, all in
the tasisulam arm. Investigation of the unexpectedly high rate of hematologic toxicity revealed a subset of patients with low tasisulam clearance, leading to drug accumulation and high albumin-corrected exposure in cycle 2. CONCLUSIONS: Although the study
was stopped early because of safety issues in the tasisulam arm, tasisulam was considered unlikely to be superior to paclitaxel, and
paclitaxel activity in the second-line treatment of melanoma was much lower than expected. The toxicity imbalance was attributed to
an unexpectedly low tasisulam clearance in a subset of patients, underscoring the importance of pharmacokinetic monitoring of comC 2014 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Although comprising only approximately 4% of skin cancer cases, melanoma is responsible for approximately 80% of all
skin cancer deaths.1,2 Targeted agents, such as BRAF inhibitors, can be used in approximately one-half of patients, most of
whom will develop resistance after a few months.3,4 Only 20% of patients might benefit from immunotherapy.5 Thus,
effective therapies for patients with metastatic melanoma remain a critical unmet need.
In a phase 2 study of tasisulam, a novel acylsulfonamide compound with a unique dual mechanism of action involving mitotic catastrophe and antiangiogenesis,6,7 8 of 68 patients with second-line metastatic melanoma achieved a partial
response, for an overall response rate (RR) of 11.8%.8 The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.6 months and
the median overall survival (OS) was 9.6 months. Tasisulam was generally well tolerated, with thrombocytopenia reported
to be the predominant treatment-related grade 3=4 toxicity (20.6% of patients).

Tasisulam for Metastatic Melanoma/Hamid et al

The crucial need for new therapeutic agents and the
encouraging results with tasisulam in phase 2 studies led
to the phase 3 study described herein in which tasisulam
was compared with paclitaxel as second-line treatment in
patients with metastatic melanoma. However, complications of myelosuppression occurred at a higher frequency
than expected in the tasisulam arm, resulting in early
study closure. Nonetheless, enrollment was sufficient to
provide insight into the activity and safety profiles of
each agent in the second-line treatment of metastatic
melanoma, which is particularly important for paclitaxel
given that it is widely used for this indication, although
to the best of our knowledge, relatively little information
regarding its safety and efficacy is known. In addition,
pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses were conducted to
explore the cause of the unexpectedly high rate of
myelosuppression-related complications observed in the
tasisulam arm.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population

Patients were required to be aged  18 years with a diagnosis of AJCC stage IV metastatic melanoma. Patients
with active central nervous system metastasis, primary
ocular melanoma, or mucosal melanoma were excluded.
All patients were required to have evaluable disease as
defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (version 1.0),9 an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1, and disease progression after 1 previous systemic treatment containing
dacarbazine or temozolomide. Previous cancer therapies
were discontinued at least 30 days before study enrollment. Immunotherapy or antibody-based regimens or
treatment with a targeted agent (eg, BRAF, c-KIT inhibitor) were not considered previous treatments, unless either agent was combined with a cytotoxic drug. Baseline
laboratory analytes were assessed to ensure that patients
had adequate bone marrow reserve, hepatic function,
and renal function.
Tasisulam is highly albumin-bound (> 99.7%);
therefore, a serum albumin level  3.0 g=dL was required.
Because of potential drug interactions, patients receiving
warfarin (or structurally similar analogues) or those
unable to withhold dosing of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for  72 h
before and after treatment with tasisulam were excluded.
The study was approved by local ethical review boards
and was conducted according to applicable laws and the
Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written
informed consent.

Treatment

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment with
tasisulam or paclitaxel. Stratification factors included the
following: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (baseline LDH;
 240 U=L vs > 240 U=L [the upper limit of normal]),
previous immunotherapy ( 1 course without other agent
vs no prior immunotherapy, or  1 course with other
agent), disease stage (M1a or M1b vs M1c), age (< 60
years vs  60 years), and sex. At the time of study initiation, there were only 2 treatments approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration for melanoma, dacarbazine and interleukin-2,10,11 and no approved second-line
therapy. Paclitaxel was chosen as the comparator because
of its single-agent activity and use as a comparator in
phase 2=3 metastatic melanoma studies.12,13
Tasisulam (Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, Ind) was
administered as a 2-h intravenous infusion on day 1 of a
28-day cycle. The first tasisulam dose-escalation study
used a flat-dose escalation schema up to 2400 mg, and the
maximum tolerated dose was 2000 mg.14 However, the
large interpatient and intrapatient variability in peak
plasma concentration (Cmax) and the high albumin binding suggested that flat dosing would not provide consistent drug exposure. Furthermore, controlling Cmax
reduced the risk of toxicity, and Cmax was negatively correlated with lean body weight (LBW). Thus, the dosing
regimen was revised using an LBW-based algorithm that
targeted specific Cmax concentrations. Cmax-based dosing
was stopped at 420 lg=mL because of dose-limiting toxicity (primarily hematologic toxicity). This was the dose
used as the loading dose for the phase 2 study in patients
with metastatic melanoma.8 Meanwhile, PK, safety, and
efficacy results of other phase 2 studies of tasisulam identified an albumin-corrected exposure (AUCalb) range
(1200-6400 h.lg=mL) that was associated with efficacy
and a more moderate risk of hematologic toxicity (data on
file; Eli Lilly and Co.).15 Thus, in the current phase 3
study, the specific dose administered to an individual
patient was calculated to target this AUCalb range using
an LBW algorithm and predose serum albumin level.
Patients received a loading dose at cycle 1 and a lower
chronic dose (65%-90% of the loading dose) because of
the long tasisulam half-life (approximately 11 days-12
days). Paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) was administered at a dose of 80 mg=m2 on days
1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle.
Dose adjustments were allowed after cycle 1 for
patients who developed unacceptable toxicity. The tasisulam dose was reduced to 75% of the calculated dose if a
patient experienced grade 4 reduced neutrophils,  grade

event (AE) (excluding allergic reactions, nausea, vomiting
controlled by medication, or electrolyte imbalance controlled by supplementation) in the previous cycle. The
paclitaxel dose could be reduced to 70 mg=m2 for patients
who experienced grade 3=4 toxicity and, if necessary, to 60
mg=m2 after a second episode of grade 3=4 toxicity.

stratified log-rank test (see stratification factors above). Tumor RR was compared based on an unadjusted, normal
distribution approximation for the difference in rates.
Between-treatment differences in safety-related outcomes
were compared using an unadjusted Fisher exact test. All
tests of treatment effects were conducted at either a 1-sided
alpha level of .025 or a 2-sided alpha level of .05. All confidence intervals (CIs) were given at a 2-sided 95% level.

Assessments

The primary efficacy measure was OS. For patients not
known to have died as of the data cutoff date, OS was censored at the time of last contact. A secondary efficacy measure was PFS. For patients not known to have died or to
have experienced objective disease progression, PFS was
censored at the time of the last complete lesion assessment. PFS was assessed at every other cycle, at the time of
treatment discontinuation, and approximately every 60
days thereafter until disease progression. Best overall
response was determined by the investigator according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.9
A physical examination and recording of ECOG
performance status were performed at baseline, at every
cycle, and at the time of treatment discontinuation. Radiological imaging was performed at baseline, at the end of
every other cycle, and at the time of treatment discontinuation. Treatment-emergent AEs and laboratory tests were
collected at baseline, at every cycle, and at the time of
treatment discontinuation. AEs were captured as actual
terms coded to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities terms. AE severity was assessed by the investigator
before each visit (until at least 30 days after treatment discontinuation) according to the Common Terminology
for Adverse Events (version 3.0).16 Treatment-related toxicity was based on investigator assessment.
Statistical Analysis

The original accrual goal was 400 patients per treatment
arm. The study was designed to have 80% power to
achieve statistical significance at a 1-sided a level of .025
if the true hazards ratio (HR) of tasisulam versus paclitaxel
was 0.75. When the study was stopped, a futility analysis
based on PFS (log-rank P value > .208 to stop the trial)
was performed to determine whether additional patient
follow-up was warranted.
Efficacy analyses included data from all randomized
patients and safety analyses included data from all patients
who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Efficacy and
safety analyses used intent-to-treat methodology.
Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed for PFS and OS.17
Differences between treatment arms were tested using a

PK Analyses

Plasma samples were collected during cycle 1 on days 1
(preinfusion, end of infusion [EOI], and 2-3 h after EOI),
8, and 15 and during cycle 2 on day 1 (preinfusion and
EOI). Tasisulam concentrations were analyzed using a
validated liquid chromatography=mass spectrometry=mass spectrometry method by Advion BioServices,
Inc (Ithaca, NY).14
The population PK data set was analyzed using the
nonlinear mixed-effect modeling program NONMEM
(ICON Development Solutions, Ellicott City, Md.) (version 6) and first-order conditional estimation with interaction. A 2-compartment model was used for the PK
analysis. The model selected for the total drug concentration was derived from the results of previous analysis of
phase 1 and phase 2 data.
RESULTS
Early Study Termination and Patient
Characteristics

The study was initiated in December 2009 (Eli Lilly and
Co. trial H8K-MC-JZAO; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT01006252) and conducted by 98 investigators at 92
sites in 16 countries.
An imbalance in possibly drug-related deaths was
identified by the external data monitoring committee after
336 patients had been enrolled. Preliminary review of the
deaths indicated that complications of tasisulam-related
myelosuppression, particularly fever and neutropenia,
infection, and=or sepsis, had occurred at a higher frequency than expected for this patient population, leading
to the study being placed on full clinical hold. An analysis
of PFS in all patients enrolled before the clinical hold
failed the futility test boundary, indicating it was unlikely
that tasisulam would be superior to paclitaxel if the
remaining patients were followed until disease progression
or death. Thus, all patients receiving study treatment were
discontinued and the study was permanently closed.
At the time of study closure, 336 of the 406 patients
who entered the study had been randomized, with 168
patients randomized to each treatment arm. Of the

(range, 1199 mg-2426 mg; n 5 128 patients) in cycle 2.
Safety

The percentage of patients who reported  1 possibly
drug-related AE was comparable between treatment arms
(76.8% in the tasisulam arm vs 73.9% in the paclitaxel
arm; P 5 .607). Of possibly drug-related AEs occurring
in  10% of patients, alopecia was observed significantly
more frequently in the paclitaxel arm, whereas thrombocytopenia was observed significantly more frequently in
the tasisulam arm (both P < .001) (Table 3).
More patients in the tasisulam arm experienced possibly drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) than in
the paclitaxel arm (23.2% vs 8.7%; P < .001). The most
common possibly drug-related SAE in the tasisulam arm
was thrombocytopenia (11.0% vs 0.6% for paclitaxel).
2020

Neutropenia=leukopenia was also a more common SAE
in the tasisulam arm (6.7% vs 1.2% in the paclitaxel arm).
The tasisulam arm had a significantly higher percentage of patients who discontinued treatment due to a
possibly drug-related AE (8.5% vs 1.9% in the paclitaxel
arm; P 5 .011) or possibly drug-related SAE (8.5% vs
0.6% in the paclitaxel arm; P < .001).
All the possibly drug-related nonlaboratory toxicities
of  grade 3 in the paclitaxel arm were of grade 3 and
occurred in cycle 2 or later (Table 3). In the tasisulam
arm, diarrhea and febrile neutropenia occurred predominantly in cycles 1 and 2, whereas all other toxicities
occurred only in cycle 3.
Laboratory Parameters

More patients in the tasisulam arm (51.2%) experienced a
grade  3 laboratory hematologic toxicity than in the
paclitaxel arm (31.1%), mainly thrombocytopenia
(18.9% vs 1.9%) and combined neutropenia=leukopenia
events (14.0% vs 8.7%) (Table 3).
Deaths

Of the 37 total deaths reported on study or within 30 days
of treatment discontinuation (24 in the tasisulam arm and
13 in the paclitaxel arm), 13 occurred in the setting of
possibly related AEs (all tasisulam). The majority of
these deaths were associated with complications of

PK Analyses

PK analyses explored the cause of the unexpectedly
high rate of myelosuppression and related complications in the tasisulam arm. The percentage of patients
with an AUCalb within the intended target range
(1200-6400 h.lg=mL) was 58% in cycle 1 and 46% in
cycle 2 (Table 4), which is consistent with predictions
from previous phase 2 data (data on file; Eli Lilly and

AUCalb of  6400 h.lg=mL, a finding that is also
consistent with predicted values (20%). However, 34%
of patients in cycle 2 had an AUCalb  6400 h.lg=mL
(23% with  10,000 h.lg=mL), which is much higher

2. Eighteen patients experienced grade 4=5 hematologic toxicity in cycle 2, the majority with higher
AUCalb values in cycle 2 compared with cycle 1, suggesting drug accumulation due to lower tasisulam
clearance (Fig. 3).
A tasisulam concentration of 130 lg=mL on day 15
of cycle 1 (C1D15) separated the patients with and without grade 4=5 hematologic toxicity in cycle 2 (Fig. 4
Top). Patients with a concentration  130 lg=mL on
C1D15 had a total tasisulam clearance of 0.0102 to
0.0166 L=h (below the population mean of 0.0251 L=h,
which is similar to observations in phase 1 and 2 studies8,14) and comprised a very high-risk group for grade
4=5 hematologic toxicities in cycle 2 (Fig. 4 Bottom).
Analysis of Additional Variables Affecting
Safety Outcomes

Using univariate analyses, the use of CYP2C19inhibiting PPIs before the safety event significantly predicted a grade 4=5 hematologic AE (odds ratio [OR],
3.16; 95% CI, 1.30-7.67 [P 5 .011]). Use of CYP2C19inhibiting PPIs at any time did not predict a fatal event
(OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 0.46-5.49 [P 5 .464]). Age > 65
years significantly predicted a grade 4=5 hematologic AE
(OR, 4.47; 95% CI, 1.84-10.85 [P < .001]) or a fatal
event (OR, 7.15; 95% CI, 1.88-27.18 [P 5 .004]).
Using stepwise logistic regression analysis, the only significant predictor for most outcomes after controlling for
variables (PPI use or poor metabolizer genotype, age,
and creatinine clearance) was C1D15 tasisulam
concentration.

Figure 4. Tasisulam clearance and grade (Gr) 4=5 hematologic adverse events are shown. AUCalb indicates area under
the concentration time curve above the albumin-corrected
threshold; C1D15, cycle 1, day 15; N, number of patients. Boxes
represent the 25th and 75th percentiles, and the line within
the boxes represents the median. Whiskers represent the 10th
and 90th percentiles.

These findings are consistent with analysis of the
free (unbound) tasisulam concentration, which demonstrated a lower unbound clearance than the population
mean (40.11 L=h) in 27 of 28 of the patients who experienced grade 4=5 hematologic toxicities in cycles 1 or 2.
DISCUSSION
The current study compared tasisulam, a novel investigational anticancer agent, with paclitaxel as second-line
treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma.
Unfortunately, tasisulam-related myelosuppression and
related complications occurred at a higher frequency than
expected for this patient population. Although the study
was closed before the primary endpoint could be evaluated, interim analysis indicated that tasisulam was
2022

unlikely to be superior to paclitaxel in this study if
additional patients were followed until disease progression
or death. Several studies have reported paclitaxel activity
in patients with metastatic melanoma. The RR was
15.6% when paclitaxel was administered as a short infusion19 and 12% to 16% when it was administered as a 24h infusion, with several patients reported to achieve a
CR.20-22 In the current study, which to the best of our
knowledge is the largest published to date using singleagent paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma, the RR in second-line treatment was
only 4.8% with a PFS of 2.1 months, and no patient
achieved a CR. Previous studies have suggested that paclitaxel plus carboplatin may have little added benefit in the
second-line treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma, but may be associated with greater hematologic
toxicity.23,24 In the current study, paclitaxel was found to
be relatively well tolerated, with alopecia (30.4%), fatigue
(24.2%), and nausea (14.9%) the most common possibly
related AEs. Neutropenia=leukopenia was the most common grade  3 possibly drug-related AE (8.7%), a finding
that is consistent with previous findings.25,26
The incorporation of PK sampling into this phase 3
study provided sufficient information to determine why
severe tasisulam-related hematologic toxicity occurred at a
much higher frequency than in a previous phase 2 study.8
The majority of observed grade 4=5 cases of hematologic
toxicity were explained by low tasisulam clearance, which
led to drug accumulation in cycle 2 due to a very long compound half-life. Because of high-affinity albumin binding
and rapid, extensive metabolism of free tasisulam in vivo,
preclinical studies had failed to identify a clearance mechanism for unbound (free) tasisulam, the biologically active
form. Unbound tasisulam clearance was found to be lower
than the population mean (40.11 L=h) in 27 of 28 patients
who experienced grade 4=5 hematologic toxicities in cycles
1 or 2 (data not shown). Exploratory analyses revealed several possible explanations for the lower tasisulam clearance,
including CYP2C19 polymorphisms and the use of
CYP2C19-inhibiting PPIs, which are consistent with subsequent findings that tasisulam may be metabolized by
CYP2C19. However, none of these factors, including clinical factors such as age, explained the majority of observed
grade 4=5 cases of hematologic toxicity in the current
study, suggesting that other factors likely affect tasisulam
clearance and=or albumin binding. Tasisulam concentration at C1D15 was found to be the best predictor of serious
hematological toxicity in cycle 2 or later, consistent with a
simulation demonstrating that 17 of the 18 patients who
experienced grade 4 hematologic toxicity in cycle 2 (94%)

would have had an AUCalb < 10,000 h.lg=mL with a preemptive dose adjustment based on their C1D15 PK value
(Fig. 3 Right). Thus, this parameter has been added to the
revised individualized dosing calculator for ongoing tasisulam studies.
In conclusion, despite early study closure due to toxicity, PFS analysis did not suggest a benefit for tasisulam over
paclitaxel. Although paclitaxel was well tolerated, its efficacy
as a single agent in the second-line treatment of patients
with metastatic melanoma was quite modest. The unexpected toxicity observed in the current trial, despite highly
tailored dosing, illustrates the usefulness of PK sampling in
late-phase global oncology studies, particularly those with
complex pharmacology. Insights from the PK and safety
findings of the current study have been incorporated into
subsequent and currently ongoing tasisulam studies.
