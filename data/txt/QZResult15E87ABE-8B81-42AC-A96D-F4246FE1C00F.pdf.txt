Abstract
Dibenzoylmethane (DBM), a minor B-diketone constituent of
licorice, has been shown to exhibit antineoplastic effects in
prostate cancer cell lines by induction of cell cycle arrest and
regulation of androgen receptor expression. In the present
study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of DBM
using TRAMP-C1 cell lines and TRAMP mice. DBM was found
to arrest TRAMP-C1 cells at G2-M phase of cell cycle and
suppressed phosphorylated retinoblastoma, cyclin D1, and
cyclin A. Importantly, DBM was found to be equally effective in
suppression of prostate tumor progression in TRAMP mice. At
8 or 12 weeks of age, mice were fed control or 1% DBMsupplemented diets until 24 weeks of age. Our results show
that DBM-fed groups had a lower incidence of palpable tumor
and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Subsequent mechanistic studies show that the expression of
phosphorylated retinoblastoma, c-myc, cyclin D1, cyclin A,
phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated PDK-1, and phosphorylated S6 was significantly reduced by DBM. Our findings
suggest that DBM blocks the growth and progression of
prostate cancer in TRAMP mice via modulation of tumor cell
cycle regulation and therefore merits its consideration for
future clinical intervention of human prostate cancer. [Cancer

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer expected to occur in
men with an estimation of 218,890 new cases leading to 27,050
estimated deaths in 2007 (1). Although localized prostate cancer is
curable by traditional clinical interventions, metastatic disease
leads to hormone refractory progression and is usually resulting in
lethality. Prostate tumorigenesis in humans is an extremely long
process involving a cascade of genetic alterations. Progression from
preneoplastic lesions known as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
(PIN) to androgen-independent invasive carcinoma may takes
several decades to occur and, therefore, provides a possible
opportunity for chemopreventive interventions (2). Epidemiologic
studies show that dietary and environmental factors play an
important role in prostate carcinogenesis (3). Indeed, high
vegetable-and-fruit consumption was inversely associated with

prostate cancer, suggesting that the disease may be preventable by
a change in life-style or dietary habits (4, 5).
Dibenzoylmethane (DBM), a minor constituent of licorice, has
been shown to be a promising anticancer, antimutagenic, and
cancer chemopreventive compound. We have recently shown that
DBM, when given alone or in combination with sulforaphane,
significantly inhibited the development of familial intestinal
adenomatous polyposis in ApcMin/+ mouse (6). Likewise, DBM
has been reported to inhibit 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene–
induced mammary tumors and lymphomas/leukemias in Sencar
mice (7). DBM is also a very strong antimutagenic agent that could
effectively inhibit mutagenicity induced by several heterocyclic
amines (8). Although DBM has been reported to inhibit the growth
of several prostate cancer cell lines, its in vivo antineoplastic
activity has yet to be tested.
In the present study, the in vitro and in vivo prostate cancer
chemopreventive efficacy of DBM was investigated using TRAMP
(transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate)–C1 cells and TRAMP
mice, respectively. TRAMP mouse is an autochthonous transgenic
animal model of prostate cancer that recapitulates the whole
spectrum of human prostate tumorigenesis from the earliest PIN
lesions to androgen-independent disease (9). TRAMP mice develop
PINs with mild to severe hyperplasia by 8 weeks old. Severe
hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma is evidenced in the dorsolateral
and ventral lobes of prostate by 18 weeks of age and will eventually
develop primary prostate tumors that may metastasize primarily to
lymph nodes and lungs by 24 to 26 weeks of age (9). The TRAMPC1 cells were originated from a heterogeneous 32-week tumor of
the TRAMP mouse. Although the IC50 of DBM on TRAMP-C1 cells
was found to be >100 Amol/L, DBM arrested the cells at G2-M at 50
Amol/L with concomitant suppression of some cell cycle–specific
biomarkers, such as cyclin D1 and phosphorylated retinoblastoma
(pRb). In agreement with the in vitro results, DBM also suppressed
the progression of prostate tumorigenesis in TRAMP mice. Mice
fed with DBM started at 12 weeks of age developed lower
percentage of high-grade PINs (HG PIN) and palpable tumors when
compared with their control counterparts. More strikingly, when
DBM was given to the TRAMP mice at 8 weeks of age, the time
when PINs started to develop, the incidence of palpable tumors
and in situ carcinoma was totally blocked.

DBM Inhibits Prostate Carcinogenesis in TRAMP Mice
Cell culture. The TRAMP-C1 cells (10), a generous gift from Dr. Barbara
Foster (Roswell Park Cancer Institute), was maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 10 to 8 mol/L
5-androstan-17h-ol-3-one, and antibiotics.
Flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle distribution. The flow cytometry
analysis of cell cycle distribution was performed as previously described
(11). Briefly, TRAMP-C1 cells were seeded in 60-mm Petri dishes in complete
DMEM overnight. The cells were then serum starved for 24 h in serum-free
DMEM. Before treatment, the medium was replaced with complete DMEM
containing either 0.1% DMSO (as a negative control) or a varying dose of
DBM. After DBM treatments, the cells were collected by trypsinization. Cells
were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was
then resuspended in 500 AL PBS, and the resulting cell suspension was
passed through a 26.5-gauge needle thrice. The cells were then fixed by
adding 500 AL ethanol. The fixed cells were then stained by 100 Ag/mL
RNase A and 10 Ag/mL propidium iodide at 4jC for 30 min. Cell cycle
distribution was then analyzed by flow cytometry using the fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis core facility of Rutgers University and
University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
Animals. Female hemizygous C57BL/TGN TRAMP mice, line PB Tag
8247NG, and male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory. The animals were bred on same genetic background and

maintained in the Animal Care Facility of Rutgers University. Housing
and care of the animals were in accordance with the guidelines established
by the University’s Animal Research Committee consistent with the NIH
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Transgenic males
for these studies were routinely obtained as [TRAMP  C57BL/6] F1 or as
[TRAMP  C57BL/6] F2 offspring. Identity of transgenic mice was
established by PCR-based DNA screening. Throughout the experiment,
the animals were housed in cages with wood chip bedding in a temperaturecontrolled room (68–72jF) with a 12-h light-dark cycle at a relative
humidity of 45% to 55%. The animals were fed with irradiated AIN-76A diet
or DBM-supplemented AIN-76A diet (DYETS, Inc.).
Study design. After 1 wk of acclimatization, 8 wk old (Group 1; G1) or
12 wk old (Group 2; G2) male TRAMP mice were fed with 1% of DBM
(f30 mg of DBM per day per mouse) in AIN-76A diet until they are 24 wk
old (n = 12). The control animals received AIN-76A diet throughout the
experiment. The animals were weighed weekly and monitored on a regular
basis for their general health. At each time point, the mice were killed by
cervical dislocation, and the genitourinary apparatus consisting of the
seminal vesicles, prostate, and bladder were isolated for further analyses.
Histopathology. The dorso-lateral prostate was excised and fixed
overnight in 10% formalin and then transferred to 70% ethanol. Sections
(4 Am) were cut from paraffin-embedded tissue and mounted on slides.

The sections were stained with H&E to observe any neoplastic changes.
Sections were blinded and evaluated by a histopathologist (X.H.) to
classify the PIN lesions. Lesions were classified as PIN I, PIN II, PIN III,
and PIN IV, as described by Park and coworkers (12). For the purpose of
simplicity, PIN I and PIN II have been grouped as low-grade PIN whereas
PIN III and PIN IV have been grouped as high-grade PIN, as we have
previously done (13).
Western blotting. For in vitro experiment, TRAMP-C1 cells in six-well
plates were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 200 AL of cell lysis
buffer (Cell Signaling) after DBM treatment. For in vivo study, the dorsalateral prostate dissected from mice of each treatment group was weighed,
pooled, and treated with cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) at a concentration
of 10 Ag/mL for 40 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 14,800  g for
15 min. The protein concentrations of the supernatant were measured by
using the bicinchoninic acid solution (Pierce). Protein (20 Ag) was loaded
onto precasted SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) and, after electrophoresis,
transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was
blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (PBST) for 1 h and
incubated with primary antibody in 5% bovine serum albumin–0.1% PBST
overnight at 4jC. After three 5-min washes with PBST, the membrane was
then incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody in 5% nonfat dry milk–PBST for 1 h at room temperature and then
washed with PBST thrice. The transferred proteins were visualized with the
Super Signal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce).
Quantification of DBM in plasma and prostate tissues using highperformance liquid chromatography. Plasma and prostate tissue
concentrations of DBM in TRAMP mice were measured at the end of
24 wk using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)–
UV detection method (14). Briefly, a 50-AL aliquot of the plasma or
homogenized prostate tissues samples was added to the internal standard
(CHMPP) working solution and extracted twice with 200 AL ethyl acetate/
methanol (95:5 v/v) solution. The organic layer was separated by
centrifugation and evaporated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen gas
at room temperature. The residue was reconstituted in 100 AL of
acetonitrile/water (50:50 v/v) solution, and 20 AL were injected onto an
HPLC column. Analyses were performed using a Shimadzu HPLC system at
4jC with a reverse-phase column (Gemini C18 column, 150  2.0 mm, 5 Am,
Phenomenex) protected with a SecurityGuard cartridge system (Phenomenex) and a 0.45-Am in-line filter. The binary gradient mobile phase [mobile
phase A (water/methanol, 80:20 v/v, with 0.1% trifluoroacetyl) and mobile
phase B (acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetyl)] were pumped at the flow
rate of 0.2 mL/min. The UV detector was set at a single wavelength of
335 nm. The Class-VP software version 7.1.1 (Shimadzu) was used for
instrument control and data analysis. The retention time for DBM and
internal standard (CHMPP) were 21.4 and 24.0 min, respectively. The lower
limit of quantification for DBM was 0.05 Ag/mL, and the linear calibration
curves were obtained in the concentration ranges of 0.05 to 20 Ag/mL.
Statistical analysis. Student’s t test or Fisher exact test was used for the
statistical analysis. P values of <0.05 were considered significant.

Effects of DBM-supplemented diet on TRAMP mice and
general health observations. The overall health of all the mice
was observed on a weekly basis and was found to be good
throughout the study period. Gross autopsy of these animals failed
to reveal any sign of toxicity or abnormalities. In addition, DBM
treatment has no significant effect on the weight of liver, spleen,
and kidneys.
Effect of DBM on prostate tumorigenesis. The only difference
between groups 1 and 2 is that the former were given DBMsupplemented diet earlier when the mice were 8 weeks old,
whereas the latter started at the age of 12 weeks old with both sets
of mice terminated at the same time at 24 weeks of age (Fig. 3A).
The effect of DBM for each experiment on the wet weight of the
genitourinary apparatus is shown in Fig. 3B. DBM significantly
decreased the genitourinary weight with P values of 0.004 and
0.002, respectively, for groups 1 and 2. In addition, the incidence of
palpable tumor was lower in mice from group 2 (not statistically
significant) and was totally blocked by DBM treatment in group 1
(Fig. 3C). Histologic examination of prostate tissue by H&E
staining revealed that the mice in group 1 have significantly
lower proportion of HG PINs compared with the control animals
(Fig. 4A). The incidence of poorly differentiated carcinoma was also
found to be significantly lower in mice from group 1 (Fig. 4B).
Although the incidence of palpable tumor and poorly differentiated
carcinoma, as well as proportion of HG PIN, was lower in mice
from group 2, they were not statistically significant compared with
their control counterpart. Taken together, the results show that
DBM treatment suppressed the progression of prostate tumorigenesis in TRAMP mice. More interestingly, the inhibitory effect of

Results
DBM induced G2-M cell cycle arrest in TRAMP-C1 cells. After
24 hours of treatment of DBM at various doses, flow cytometry
analysis was performed. Our results showed that the percentage of
TRAMP-C1 cells in G2-M was significantly increased from 19.08% in
control to 38.26% and 40.83% at 50 and 100 Amol/L DBM
treatment, respectively (Fig. 1).
DBM-induced G2-M arrest is associated with suppression of
cell cycle–related biomarkers. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms by which DBM exerts its cell cycle arrest effect, the
protein expression level of several cell cycle–related biomarkers
were evaluated. We found that DBM suppressed the expression of
pS6, c-myc, pRb, cyclin D1, and cyclin A in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2).

or 12 wk old (G2) TRAMP mice (12 mice per group) were fed with DBM-supplemented diet until 24 wk of age. Control mice were fed with standard AIN-76A diet
throughout the study. In TRAMP mice, PIN starts to develop around 10 wk of age. By 18 wk of age, invasive adenocarcinoma could be detected, and by 24 wk of age,
TRAMP mice develop prostate cancer that metastasizes to lymph nodes and lungs/livers. B, the effect of DBM supplemented diet on the genitourinary weight.
*, significantly different from the control. C, incidence of palpable tumor in the 24-wk-old control versus treated animals. Only 18.2% of mice from G2 and none of the
mice from G1 developed palpable tumor by 24 wk of age.

DBM on progression of prostate cancer is significantly stronger
when it was given before the PIN started to develop.
Steady-state levels of DBM in plasma and target tissue. The
relationship between the chemopreventive efficacy of DBM in
TRAMP mice and the concentration of the compound was
investigated in the present study. Steady-state levels were
determined in the plasma and prostate, the target tissue, which
had received dietary DBM for 16 and 12 weeks for groups 1 and 2,
respectively, using HPLC. Mean level of DBM in the plasma was
found to be 1.099 F 0.306 and 1.461 F 0.237 Amol/L for mice in
groups 1 and 2, respectively. In the prostate, DBM concentration
was found to be 0.408 F 0.050 and 0.279 F 0.104 nmol/mg protein
for mice from groups 1 and 2, respectively.
Effect of DBM on Akt signaling pathway and cell cycle
regulation. To investigate the in vivo mechanism of action by
which DBM exerts its chemopreventive effect, several biomarkers
covering the Akt signal transduction pathway and cell cycle
regulation were evaluated. The expression of p-PDK-1, pAkt
(Ser473), pS6 ribosomal protein (Ser235/236), c-myc, pRb, cyclin A,
and cyclin D1 were all found to be increased gradually concomitant
with tumor progression, suggesting that they are appropriate
biomarkers for prostate tumorigenesis in TRAMP mice (Fig. 5). Our
results show that DBM treatment significantly suppressed the
expression of these biomarkers. Stronger suppression on these
biomarkers was found in group 1 compared with group 2.

Discussion
Radical prostatectomy and radiation therapies are the most
common and also the most effective clinical interventions to treat
early or localized prostate cancer (15). However, as the disease
progress, advanced or invasive prostate cancers are far more
resistant to most of the therapeutic agents, and as a result, androgen
deprivation therapy is needed. Substantial tumor remission can
be achieved after the deprivation of androgen, but unfortunately,
recurrent tumors arise within a period of 2 to 3 years (16). Given
that the progression from the earliest lesions to metastasized
prostate cancers may take several decades to establish, chemoprevention by dietary compounds could be an ideal strategy to halt
prostate tumorigenesis. In the present study, the efficacy of DBM as
a chemopreventive agent for prostate tumorigenesis was tested
using TRAMP mice model.
DBM, a h-diketone analogue of curcumin, has shown
antineoplastic effects in several carcinogen-induced preclinical
models of cancer. In two independent reports, Singletary and
colleagues and Huang and colleagues show that diet supplemented with 1% DBM significantly inhibited both the multiplicity
and incidence of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene–induced mammary tumor in rat and Sencar mice, respectively (7, 17). More
interestingly, both experiments found that DBM was far more
potent than curcumin in inhibiting mammary tumors. In
addition to mammary tumors, DBM is also reported to inhibit

7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene–induced lymphomas/leukemias
and 7,12-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate–induced skin tumors
in mice (7). Carcinogen detoxification through activation of
phase II detoxifying machinery has been suggested as the main
mechanism of action by which DBM exhibits its antineoplastic
effect in the carcinogen-induced preclinical model of cancers.
However, we have recently shown that DBM can also prevent
adenomatous polyposis in APCmin/+ mice at the promotion
stage of carcinogenesis through induction of apoptosis, inhibition
of cell growth, and deregulation of cell cycle (6). In addition,
DBM has been reported to possess antiinflammatory, antimutagenic, antiestrogenic, and antiandrogenic activity (8, 18–20). DBM
has been reported to inhibit the growth of LNCaP, DU145, and
PC-3 prostate cancer cells in vitro; however, its in vivo efficacy
has not yet been reported. In the present study, we tested the
potential of DBM as a chemotherapeutic or/and chempreventive
agent using TRAMP-C1 cell lines and TRAMP mice, respectively. We
found that, whereas DBM has an IC50 higher than 100 Amol/L
(data not shown), it significantly arrested the cells at G2-M phase
of cell cycle. More importantly, our in vivo results showed that
DBM possessed strong chemopreventive activity as shown by its
ability to suppress the progression of prostate tumor in TRAMP
mice. Mice fed with DBM developed significantly lower incidence
of HG PIN and poorly differentiated carcinoma when compared
with their control counterparts. Strikingly, the chemopreventive
efficacy of DBM was stronger when the treatment was started
earlier (8 versus 12 weeks of age). Approximately 53% and 27% of
HG PIN was inhibited in DBM-treated mice from groups 1 and 2,
respectively. Poorly differentiated carcinoma was totally prevented
in the mice of group 1 compared with 32% inhibition achieved in

group 2. Steady-state levels of DBM in plasma obtained from
mice from group 1 were found to be higher when compared with
mice from group 2. In contrast, DBM levels in prostate tissues
obtained from mice from group 1 were higher than group 2,
indicating that steady-state levels of the compound in the target
tissue rather than plasma could be a better indicator of predicting
the cancer chemopreventive efficacy of compound. It is important
to note that the concentration of DBM in the prostate tissues
detected in the present study was at least 5-fold lower than the
concentration found in the intestinal tissues from our previous
study (0.4 nmol/mg protein versus 1.97 nmol/mg protein; ref. 6).
In addition, the in vivo concentration of DBM found in the
prostate tissues is much lower than the in vitro effective dose
(50 Amol/L) based on our cell culture studies. This observation
suggests that prostate cancer chemoprevention by p.o. administration of DBM is achievable although at a lower concentration
than what could be found in the digestive tissues and in the cell
culture setting.
Our current in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that cell cycle
regulation could be one of the possible mechanisms by which DBM
exhibits its antineoplastic effect (6, 21). In fact, one of the common
features of cancers is the deregulation of cell cycle. Overexpression
of cyclin D1 has been reported in f25% of prostate cancer, and its
expression has been linked with bone metastasis (22, 23). Likewise,
c-myc has been found to be associated with clinical progression
in prostate cancer (24). In agreement with these observations, we
showed that the cell cycle arrest effect of DBM was associated
with suppression of these biomarkers in TRAMP-C1 cells. More
importantly, the expression of cyclin A, cyclin D1, pRb, and c-myc
was found to be associated with tumor progression in TRAMP

DBM Inhibits Prostate Carcinogenesis in TRAMP Mice

Figure 5. Western blot analysis of biomarkers for cell cycle regulation and cell
proliferation. The dorsa-lateral prostate dissected from at least four mice from
each treatment group were weighed, pooled, and homogenized in cell lysis
buffer. Protein (25 Ag) was loaded into each well of the gel. The values under
each row indicate the fold change of biomarker relative to sample from 24 wk
control mice [each sample was normalized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GAPDH )]. Each band was quantified using Quantity One
software (Bio-Rad Lab.).

inhibition of these biomarkers could be one of the possible
mechanisms by which DBM retards the progression of prostate
cancer in TRAMP mice. It is not clear why suppression of cyclin D1,
cyclin A, and pRb in TRAMP-C1 cells did not lead to G0-G1 arrest. It
has been reported that cyclin A is required for mitosis until mid
prophase (25). Although inhibition of cyclin D1 and pRb are
associated with G0-G1 arrest, the G1-S checkpoint could be
bypassed by certain molecular events, such as activation of Akt
signaling pathway (26).
Aberrant activation of Akt signaling pathway has been reported
in human prostate cancer, which is associated with cancer
progression (27, 28). We have previously shown that DBM can
inhibit the expression of pAkt (Ser473) in APCmin/+ mice (6). To
investigate if DBM could affect the Akt signaling pathway,
expression of pAkt, p-PDK-1, and pS6 was examined. In agreement
with clinical observations, activation of Akt signaling pathway
as shown by increased expression of pAkt, p-PDK-1, and pS6
concomitantly with tumor progression was observed in TRAMP
mice. DBM treatment significantly suppressed the expression of
these biomarkers with stronger effect being observed in mice from
group 1. Our data suggest that, in addition to cell cycle regulation,
DBM could also inhibit Akt signaling pathway to block the cancer
progression in TRAMP mice. It is clear that the effect of DBM was
significantly stronger if given before the PIN started to develop at
8 weeks of age.
Taken all these results together, our current study showed that
DBM is a potent chemopreventive agent that potentially could be
considered for clinical intervention of human prostate cancer.

model (Fig. 5). Oral administration of DBM significantly suppressed
the expression of these markers, and more interestingly, the
suppression effect was stronger when the mice were treated earlier
(experiment in G1). Because the overexpression of c-Myc and cyclin
D1, as well as pRb, promotes G1-S transition and cell cycling,
