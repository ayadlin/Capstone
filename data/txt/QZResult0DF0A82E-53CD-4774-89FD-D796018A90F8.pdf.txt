Summary
Author Manuscript

Tumor-associated endothelial cells (TECs) regulate tumor cell aggressiveness. However, the
“core” mechanism by which TECs confer stem cell-like activity to indolent tumors is unknown.
Here, we used in vivo murine and human tumor models to identify tumor-suppressive checkpoint
role of TEC-expressed insulin growth factor (IGF) binding protein-7 (IGFBP7/angiomodulin).
During tumorigenesis, IGFBP7 blocks IGF1 and inhibits expansion and engraftment of tumor
stem-like cells (TSCs) expressing IGF1-receptor (IGF1R). However, chemotherapy triggers TECs
to suppress IGFBP7, and this stimulates IGF1R+ TSCs to express FGF4, inducing a feed-forward
FGFR1-ETS2 angiocrine cascade that obviates TEC IGFBP7. Thus, loss of IGFBP7 and
upregulation of IGF1 activates the FGF4-FGFR1-ETS2 pathway in TECs and converts naive
tumor cells to chemoresistant TSCs, thereby facilitating their engraftment and progression.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

Tumors are comprised of heterogeneous tumor and host cell populations (Chao et al., 2010;
Hoey et al., 2009; Nakasone et al., 2012). Although chemotherapy can eliminate the
majority of proliferating tumor cells, a subset—referred to as tumor propagating cells or
tumor stem-like cells (TSC)—is believed to cause cancer relapse and death because they

manifest higher invasiveness and resistance to chemotherapy (chemoresistance). TSCs are
thought to be organized as the apex of a tumor hierarchy with all tumor cells growing from
this common root. However, TSCs are not necessarily rare and the mechanisms responsible
for their specialized properties are not entirely clear (Magee et al., 2012; Passegue et al.,
2009; Plaks et al., 2015; Quintana et al., 2008; Schepers et al., 2015).

Author Manuscript

By definition, TSCs share genetics with co-existing, “non-stem”, indolent tumor cells but
manifest their significant “stem” phenotypes under the influence of both cell-intrinsic and
cell-extrinsic factors. TSCs can acquire aggressive features by interacting with specialized
tumor-associated niche cells, such as vascular endothelial cells (ECs) (Bergers and Hanahan,
2008; Calabrese et al., 2007; Franses et al., 2014; Ghajar et al., 2013; Gilbert and Hemann,
2010; Hanahan and Coussens, 2012; Schmidt et al., 2011; Tavora et al., 2014). However,
identifying a "core mechanism" by which tumor-associated ECs (TECs) functionalize a
tumorigenic vascular niche to instigate and perpetuate cancer stem cell-like properties would
simplify the development of niche-targeting therapies (Carmeliet and Jain, 2011; Weis and
Cheresh, 2011).

Author Manuscript

Our group and others have shown that tissue-specific ECs provide “context-specific”
trophogenic paracrine cues, known as angiocrine factors, to trigger the propagation of stem/
progenitor cells during organ regeneration (Beck et al., 2011; Cao et al., 2016; Ding et al.,
2014; Ding et al., 2010; Ding et al., 2011; Ding et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2014; Lu et al., 2013;
Rafii et al., 2015). Indolent lymphoma cells can be interconverted to genetically identical
aggressive lymphoma TSCs expressing CD44, CSF1R, and IGF1R upon activation with
angiocrine factors produced by maladapted tumor ECs (TECs) (Cao et al., 2014; Medyouf et
al., 2011; Trimarchi et al., 2014). Similarly, TEC expression of CXCL12 can stimulate pre-T
cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia progression and gastric carcinogenesis (Hayakawa et al.,
2015; Pitt et al., 2014). It is appealing to envision development of new classes of therapeutic
agents that disrupt the perfusion-independent instructive TECs signals that promote
aggressive tumor phenotypes. Here, we hypothesized that tumor-driven subversion of TECs
deploy aberrantly programmed paracrine signals to authorize aggressive TSC phenotypes.

Results
Endothelial cells (ECs) induce IGF1R-dependent chemoresistance in TSCs

Author Manuscript

In order to eavesdrop on the crosstalk between ECs and tumor cells, we developed a serumfree system to co-culture human umbilical vein vascular ECs (HUVECs) and tumor cells
(Cao et al., 2014). This approach enabled us to dissect the molecular mechanism through
which naïve HUVEC feeders acquire pro-tumorigenic properties that endow
chemoresistance to tumor cells. Using this tumor cell-EC co-culture system, we found that
several tumor cell types—including lymphoma cells (LCs), hepatocellular carcinoma cells
(HCCs), and Lewis lung carcinoma cells (LLCs)—are more resistant to doxorubicin when
co-cultured with ECs than when cultured alone (Figure 1A). Thus, ECs form a niche that
confers chemoresistant potential to tumor cells.
ECs enhance tumor chemoresistance by stimulating the expansion of aggressive
CD44+CSF1R+IGF1R+ LCs (Cao et al., 2014). Thus, we tested the functional contribution

of CD44, CSF1R, and IGF1R in establishing chemoresistant TSCs. In tested tumor cells,
shRNA knockdown of Igf1r, but not Cd44 or Csf1r or a scrambled sequence control (Srb),
abrogated resistance to doxorubicin treatment even in the presence of EC feeders (Figure
1A). Reciprocally, adding recombinant IGF1 to serum-free medium in the absence of ECs
promoted survival of tumor cells treated with doxorubicin (Figure 1B, Figure S1A). We
found that other tumor cell types also induced IGF1R expression when co-cultured with ECs
and expression of IGF1R was required for EC-rescue of the tumor cells from chemotherapy
cytotoxicity (Figure 1C, D and Figure S1B). As such, ECs induce IGF1R expression in
tumor cells and confer to them a chemoresistant phenotype.

Author Manuscript

To investigate whether IGF1R is activated in chemoresistant human tumor cells in vivo, we
analyzed LCs isolated from patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) mice after treatment
with chemotherapy. Immunodeficient mice were transplanted with human T-cell LCs and
treated with a murine equivalent of “CHOP” chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide,
daunorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone). This PDTX mouse model allows us to study the in
vivo response of human LCs to chemotherapy. Notably, IGF1R is preferentially expressed
on the human LCs adjacent to VE-cadherin+ host ECs and was further upregulated in
lymphoma tissues that outgrew after CHOP treatment (Figure 1E, Figure S1C). Thus,
IGF1R is enriched in perivascular human LCs and is induced in chemotherapy resistant
cells.

Author Manuscript

We then sought to unravel the mechanism whereby IGF1R confers chemotherapy resistance
to tumor cells. Apoptosis and proliferation in LC transduced with scrambled sequence
(LCSrb) or Igf1r shRNA (LCshIGF1R) were compared. Both LCSrb and LCshIGF1R were
intrasplenically transplanted into mice, and recipient mice were treated with chemotherapy.
TUNEL assay showed that TECs prevented tumor cell death from chemotherapy in LCSrb,
but not LCshIGF1R, localized in the proximity of the blood vessels (Figure 1F, Figure S1D).
Additionally, inhibitor of PI3K-Akt pathway reduced the chemoresistance of LCs (Figure
S1E). Thus, induction of IGF1R by TECs in LCs stimulates Akt-activation to enhance cell
survival after doxorubicin treatment. By contrast, there was no significant difference
between cell proliferation in these two LC groups, as indicated by Ki67 staining (Figure 1G,
Figure S1F). Therefore, EC-driven IGF1R signaling in LCs provokes TSC-activity, such as
chemoresistance by enhancing cell survival rather than promoting cell proliferation.

Author Manuscript

Next, the mechanism by which IGF1R conferred in vivo chemoresistance to tumor cells was
determined. Different types of tumor cells, including LCs, HCCs and LLCs, were transduced
with scrambled sequence (tumor cell: TCSrb) or shRNA for Igf1r (TCshIGF1R), and both
TCSrb and TCshIGF1R were intraperitoneally (i.p.) or intravenously (i.v.) injected into wild
type mice to assess the in vivo tumorigenicity. The response of recipient mice to
chemotherapy was also tested. IGF1R knock down chemosensitized all three different tumor
cell types and prolonged survival of recipient mice in combination with chemotherapy
(Figure 1H).
IGF1R-dependent chemoresistance of tumor cells was then tested in different organs. Igf1r
gain and loss of function study was performed in isolated IGF1R+ and IGF1R− tumor cells
(Figure 1I). LCs and HCCs were transplanted into the mouse liver by an intrasplenic

injection model (Cao et al., 2014), and LCs and LLCs were transplanted into the mouse lung
by intravenous injection. Recipient mice were treated with doxorubicin. Knocking down
IGF1R in IGF1R+ tumor cells attenuated hepatic and pulmonary tumor load in the recipient
mice after doxorubicin treatment, to an extent comparable to that of indolent IGF1R− tumor
cells (Figure 1J, Figure S1G, H). Reciprocally, enforcing IGF1R expression in IGF1R−
tumor cells elevated tumor load in both liver and lung of treated mice. Thus, IGF1R confers
in vivo chemoresistant TSC features to tumor cells.
IGF1 expressed by TECs stimulates chemoresistance in IGF1R+ TSCs

Author Manuscript

The essential role of EC feeders in generating chemoresistant IGF1R+ TSCs led us to search
for IGF1R-ligand expressed by ECs. Since ECs in different vascular beds supply unique
tissue-specific angiocrine factors (Rafii et al., 2016), including IGF1R-ligands (Nolan et al.,
2013), we co-cultured LCs with mouse ECs isolated from different organs, including
pancreas, thymus, lung and liver. Co-culturing with mouse liver ECs induced the most
efficient LC expansion, with the highest tolerance to doxorubicin treatment (Figure 2A,
Figure S2A). As such, we compared the expression level of IGF1, the most efficient IGF1R
agonist, in the ECs. Indeed, liver ECs expressed significantly more IGF1 than ECs from
other organs (Figure 2B). Notably, silencing IGF1R in LCs or co-culturing LCs with IGF1deficient ECs abolished the vascular niche stimulated chemoresistance (Figure 2C),
implicating over-supply of IGF1 by liver ECs in the chemoresistant phenotype of cocultured LCs.

Author Manuscript

We used an inducible genetic mouse model to investigate the function of IGF1 in promoting
chemoresistance in vivo (Figure 2D). Igf1 was deleted in ECs of adult mice (Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC)
by VE-cadherin-driven tamoxifen-responsible Cre (VE-cadherin-CreERT2). LCs and HCCs
were i.p. injected into mice with EC-specific deletion of Igf1 (Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC) or control mice
(Igf1iΔEC/+). Similarly, LLCs were i.v. injected into Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC and control animals.
Recipient mice were then treated with or without doxorubicin to assess the in vivo response
to chemotherapy. Survival of Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC mice transplanted with all three types of tumor
cells was significantly prolonged compared to control mice. Injection of IGF1overexpressing tumor cells reversed the phenotype of Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC mice (Figure S2B). As
such, IGF1-derived from ECs plays an essential role in endowing chemoresistance to tumor
cells.

Author Manuscript

We further dissected the effect of endothelial-IGF1 on the organ-specific response of TSCs
to various chemotherapeutic agents. LCs and HCCs were transplanted into the liver of
Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC or control Igf1iΔEC/+ mice, and LCs and LLCs were also i.v. injected into
Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC or control mice. After treatment with doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and
cisplatin, tumor localization in the liver and lung was analyzed. Genetic deletion of Igf1 in
ECs significantly reduced tumor load in both the liver and lung following all tested types of
chemotherapy regimens (Figure 2E, Figure S2C, D). Tumor cells isolated from Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC
mice after chemotherapy showed substantially lower IGF1R activation compared to tumor
cells engrafted in control Igf1iΔEC/+ mice (Figure 2F). Hence, IGF1 expressed by TECs
instigates the chemoresistance in tumor cells possibly via activating IGF1R+ TSCs.

TECs express IGF1R antagonist IGFBP7 to constrain chemoresistance in TSCs

Author Manuscript

IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) modulate IGF1R signaling (Chen et al., 2013; Evdokimova
et al., 2012; Verhagen et al., 2014; Wajapeyee et al., 2008) and ECs express IGFBPs that
could modulate IGF1R-dependent chemoresistance in tumor cells. For these reasons, we
compared the effects of IGFBPs on IGF1R-mediated chemoresistance in LCs. Among all
tested IGFBPs, IGFBP7 decreased chemoresistance in LCs co-cultured with ECs (Figure
3A–B, Figure S3A). Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that IGFBP7, but not other IGFBPs,
bound to IGF1R and blocked its activation/phosphorylation in the presence of IGF1 (Figure
3C. D). Accordingly, IGFBP7 recombinant protein reduced TSC activity, such as colony
formation ability in LCs, whereas overexpressing IGF1R in LCs restored this activity
(Figure S3B).

Author Manuscript

To test the in vivo effects of IGFBP7 on modulating TSC features, IGF1R+ LCs, HCCs, and
LLCs were i.p. or i.v. transplanted into mice, and recipient mice were treated with IGFBP7
(Figure 3E). IGF1R activity/phosphorylation in isolated IGF1R+ tumor cell was markedly
decreased by IGFBP7 (Figure 3E–G). Mouse lethality was subsequently compared in
recipient mice after IGFBP7 injection with or without doxorubicin. For tumor cell
transplantation, IGF1R was silenced by shRNA in LCs, HCCs, and LLCs (shIGF1R) and
compared with scrambled sequence (Srb)-transduced tumor cells. Mice transplanted with
shIGF1R-transduced tumor cells survived significantly longer compared with mice engrafted
with Srb-transduced IGF1R+ tumor cells. In the presence of doxorubicin, IGFBP7 treatment
increased survival of mice transplanted with IGF1R+ tumor cells, but not tumor cells lacking
IGF1R (Figure 3H). Of note, decreased tumor load in Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC mice or after IGFBP7
treatment was not associated with perturbation of vascular perfusion (Figure S3C). As such,
IGFBP7 inhibits IGF1R-dependent and angiocrine-driven chemoresistance in IGF1R+ TSCs.

Author Manuscript

Since IGFBP7 is preferentially induced in TECs (St Croix et al., 2000), we postulated that
IGFBP7 might serve as an angiocrine tumor suppressor. To define the chemoresistancesuppressive capacity of IGFBP7 in vivo, IGFBP7 expression was analyzed in the mouse
liver and lung injected with LCs, HCCs, or LLCs. Indeed, IGFBP7 expression was
significantly elevated in both hepatic and pulmonary ECs after tumor cell transplantation,
suggesting that TECs express IGF1R-inhibitory factor to dampen the aggressive features of
IGF1R+ TSCs (Figure 3I, Figure S3D–G). Of note, expression of IGFBP7 in TECs was
strongly reduced in both liver and lung after treatment with doxorubicin, implicating
IGFBP7 as a paracrine checkpoint in TECs that is suppressed in chemoresistant tumor.

Author Manuscript

To determine the functional contribution of host IGFBP7 in abrogating tumor
chemoresistance, we employed Igfbp7 knock out (Igfbp7−/−) mice (Hooper et al., 2009).
LCs, HCCs, and LLCs were i.p. or i.v. transplanted into WT (Igfbp7+/+) or Igfbp7−/− mice
and treated with doxorubicin. Survival of Igfbp7−/− mice was lower than wild type control in
the presence of chemotherapy (Figure 4A). Of note, administration of IGFBP7 in
conjunction with doxorubicin drastically prolonged the life span of both WT and Igfbp7−/−
mice. Decreased survival of tumor-carrying Igfbp7−/− mice was accompanied by elevated
load of chemoresistant tumor in the liver and lung (Figure 4B, Figure S4A), and higher
degree of IGF1R activation in tumor cells (Figure 4C–D, Figure S4B). Notably, injection of
IGF1R neutralizing antibody similarly prolonged the life span of both WT and Igfbp7−/−

mice after chemotherapy (Figure 4E, Figure S4C). Therefore, loss of suppressive IGFBP7 in
TECs promotes activation of IGF1R signaling in chemoresistant TSCs and recurrence of an
aggressive tumor.
FGF4 derived from aggressive TSCs stimulates FGFR1 in TECs to balance IGF1 and
IGFBP7 expression

Author Manuscript

We then dissected the molecular mechanisms governing the balance between tumorigenic
IGF1 and tumor-restricting IGFBP7 in TECs. Several growth factors that might induce
endothelial cell activation were tested. Transcriptional levels of vascular endothelial growth
factor-A (VEGF-A), stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1 or CXCL12), fibroblast growth factors
(FGFs) were examined in tumor cells co-cultured with endothelial cell (Figure 5A). FGF4
was the most upregulated factor in tumor cells by doxorubicin, 5-FU and cisplatin
chemotherapy (Figure 5A–B). We then identified canonical Wnt signaling as an upstream
pathway stimulating FGF4 induction in tumor cells by doxorubicin because knockdown of
β-catenin in tumor cells suppressed FGF4 expression after doxorubicin treatment (Figure
5C, D). As such, stress induced by chemotherapeutic agents activates canonical Wnt-βcatenin to selectively upregulate FGF4 in tumor cells.

Author Manuscript

To further assess the role of FGF4 in the crosstalk between tumor cells and ECs in vivo, we
silenced Fgf4 in LCs, HCCs and LLCs with shRNA (Figure S5A), engrafted these FGF4deficient tumor cells into mouse liver and lung, and subsequently treated the recipient mice
with chemotherapy. shRNA-mediated FGF4 knockdown in tumor cells reduced activation of
several downstream effectors of FGF-receptor in neighboring TECs (Figure 5E, Figure
S5B). Importantly, IGF1 expression was reduced and IGFBP7 expression was increased in
TECs adjacent to tumor cells lacking FGF4 (Figure 5F–G). This data implicates tumor cellderived FGF4 as a key arbiter of the IGF1/IGFBP7 balance in TECs.
We then sought to identify the FGF-receptor (FGFR) relaying FGF4 signaling in TECs. We
again used shRNA to silence FGFR1 or FGFR2 in HUVECs and then co-cultured the
deficient ECs with isolated IGF1R+ LCs, HCCs, and LLCs. Knockdown of Fgfr1, but not
Fgfr2, altered the expression of IGF1 and IGFBP7 in HUVECs after incubation with
IGF1R+ TSCs (Figure 5H). Therefore, aggressive TSCs produce FGF4 that signals through
FGFR1 on TECs to upregulate IGF1 and suppress IGFBP7.

Author Manuscript

To examine the in vivo function of endothelial-supplied Fgfr1 in promoting
chemoresistance, mice with EC-specific deletion of Fgfr1 (Fgfr1iΔEC/iΔEC) were
transplanted with LCs, HCCs, LLCs. Fgfr1iΔEC/+ mice were used as control. Recipient mice
were treated with doxorubicin or vehicle. Deletion of Fgfr1 in ECs decreased IGF1
expression and increased IGFBP7 expression in TECs in liver and lung tumors after
chemotherapy (Figure 6A–B). After chemotherapy, tumor cell-engrafted Fgfr1iΔEC/iΔEC
mice lived much longer than control mice (Figure 6C, Figure S6A). In addition, IGF1R
protein expression and activation in isolated tumor cells were drastically decreased in
recipient Fgfr1iΔEC/iΔEC mice, compared to the control group (Figure 6D). Hence, activation
of FGFR1 pathway in TECs suppresses the IGF1R antagonist IGFBP7 and upregulates IGF1
(Figure 6E).

Next, we hypothesized that FGF4 activation of FGFR1 on the TECs will induce aggressive
features in indolent tumor cells. To test this, FGF4 was i.p. administered into mice one day
before limiting dilution transplantation of IGF1R+ TSCs and every three days thereafter.
FGF4 injection to host mice enhanced the lethality of all transplanted TSCs (Figure 6F). On
average, treatment with FGF4 allowed 100-fold fewer tumor cells to kill the recipient mice
compared to controls. Of note, FGF4-enhanced tumor cell lethality was abolished in
Fgfr1iΔEC/iΔEC mice, suggesting that the TSC-enabling effect of FGF4 acts via activation of
endothelial FGFR1 expressed in host mice (Bono et al., 2013) (Figure S6B).
FGFR1-ETS2 axis modulates IGF1/IGFBP7 expression in TECs

Author Manuscript

The effect of FGF4-FGFR1 axis in subverting the tumor vascular niche led us to investigate
how endothelial FGFR1 affects the IGF1/IGFBP7 checkpoint hub. E26 transformationspecific (ETS) family transcription factors modulate the behavior of both tumor cells and
associated microenvironmental cells (Phan et al., 2013). Thus, we first compared the
expression of ETS family transcription factors in naïve HUVECs co-cultured with LCs,
HCCs, and LLCs. ETS2 was preferentially upregulated in HUVECs by both co-culture with
tumor cells or FGF4 stimulation (Figure 7A–D), and genetic silencing ETS2 in HUVECs by
shRNA abolished IGF1 upregulation and prevented IGFBP7 suppression in stimulated
HUVECs (Figure 7E–G). Therefore, induction of ETS2 dictates the balance of IGF1 relative
to IGFBP7 in TECs.

Author Manuscript

In contrast, knocking down ETS2 did not influence the expression of another angiocrine
factor, Jagged1 (Cao et al., 2014; Cao et al., 2016) in co-cultured HUVECs. This effect
caused by ETS2 silencing in HUVECs was recapitulated by shRNA-mediated Fgf4
knockdown in tumor cells (Figure 7E–G). Thus, tumor-derived FGF4 activates endothelial
FGFR1 to induce ETS2-dependent IGF1 induction and IGFBP7 suppression in TECs
(Figure 7H).
IGF1 and IGFBP7 compete to regulate chemoresistance in Eμ-Myc mice

Author Manuscript

To uncover the influence of divergent IGF1 and IGFBP7 function in TECs on mediating
chemoresistance of primary tumors, Myc+ mice were crossed with either Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC or
Igfbp7−/− mice. Then, Myc+Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC, Myc+Igfbp7−/− and control mice were subjected
to doxorubicin treatment. EC-specific deletion of Igf1 markedly prolonged mouse life span,
decreased IGF1R phosphorylation, and elevated tumor cell apoptosis in Myc+ mice after
chemotherapy (Figure 8A–C). In contrast, genetic deletion of Igfbp7 in chemotherapytreated Myc+ mice lowered animal survival, increased IGF1R activation, and reduced extent
of apoptosis in Myc+ LCs (Figure 8D–G, Figure S7). Hence, IGFBP7 secreted from host
TECs represents an inhibitory checkpoint that prevents tumor cells from acquiring
aggressive attributes, such as chemoresistance. Aberrant activation of FGF4-FGFR1-ETS2
axis in TECs abrogates this suppressor factor IGFBP7, upregulating IGF1 expression in
TECs and stimulating expansion of aggressive IGF1R+ TSCs (Figure 8H).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

In this report, we first identified a tumor-suppressive “checkpoint” function of IGFBP7/
angiomodulin in TECs (Hooper et al., 2009; St Croix et al., 2000; van Beijnum et al., 2006).
Inhibition of this checkpoint in TECs favors the outgrowth of chemoresistant TSCs in
different organs. Tumor-derived FGF4 activates FGFR1 on TECs to induce expression of the
transcription factor ETS2. By blocking expression of IGFBP7 and augmenting expression of
IGF1, ETS2 hijacks TECs and subverts them to transform indolent tumors to chemoresistant
and aggressive TSCs and increase tumor-mediated lethality of the host. This maladaptive
activation of a tumor vascular niche is accompanied by reciprocal upregulation of the
IGF1R-ligand IGF1 in TECs (Zhang et al., 2013). These results show that aberrant TSC
characteristics need not to be hard-wired by cancer mutations nor completely cell
autonomous. Rather key cancer phenotypes can be directed by cues from non-malignant but
maladapted host TECs and the balance between IGF1, supporting aggressive features, and
the checkpoint decision imposed on this signaling by TEC IGFBP7. Thus, our findings
implicate an extrinsic ‘two-hit” process required for cancer stem cell-like features to
manifest in vivo.

Author Manuscript

TECs deploy this chemoresistance-stimulating "two-hit” mechanism in multiple organs. The
pro-tumorigenic function of TEC-derived IGF1 was apparent both in vitro using EC-tumor
cell co-culture and in vivo using EC-specific genetic models. Although indirect contributions
from other tumor niche components and cell types could also be involved, our data indicate
that chemotherapy-induced expression of IGF1 by TECs contributes to the persistent
aggressiveness of neighboring tumor cells. Conceivably, collaborating angiocrine signals
elaborated from TECs could direct tumor phenotypes in combination by triggering
potentially synergistic interactions between paracrine TEC-IGF1 and Notch-ligand (e.g.,
Jagged-1) activating IGF1R and juxtacrine Notch signaling in TSC (Cao et al., 2014; Lu et
al., 2013). Notably, IGF1 induced subversion of vascular niche was found in TECs localized
in lymph node, liver and lung. Thus, upregulation of IGF1 appears to be commonly involved
in maladapted reprogramming of tumor-stimulating vascular niche in different organs and
for multiple tumor types.

Author Manuscript

We identify a tumor-inhibitory “checkpoint” function of TECs in host. IGFBP7 is
upregulated in TECs and inhibits IGF1R signaling in neighboring TSCs. Curiously, this
IGFBP7-dependent brake was disrupted by chemotherapy, leading to the emergence of a
chemoresistance-stimulating vascular niche composed of subverted TECs. It is plausible that
chemotherapy triggered an injury response that altered the angiocrine activity of TECs.
Indeed, we have found that angiocrine factors elaborated from tissue-specific ECs change
during organ regeneration (Rafii et al., 2016). Early during tumor development, host ECs
may express the "checkpoint" molecule, IGFBP7, to constrain cancer progression. But after
injury they bypass this checkpoint possibly by displaying an angiocrine repertoire that forms
a supportive microenvironment for aggressive IGF1R+ TSCs. Indeed, such a stereotyped
response to injury was seen in multiple tumor-harboring organs wherein chemotherapy
suppressed IGFBP7 expression in TECs by a FGFR1-ETS2 mechanism, and simultaneously
reinforced IGF1R signaling in TSCs by upregulating TEC IGF1 using this same mechanism.
In this vein, induction of a chemoresistance-stimulating ligand, such as IGF1, and

suppression of checkpoint-like molecule could be a "hallmark" of a maladapted tumor
vascular niche begetting cancer stem cells.

Author Manuscript

It is appreciated that chemotherapy selects for resistant tumors, and unless the treatment is
able to completely eradicate cancer cells, recurrent tumors are typically resistant to
retreatment using the agents to which they initially responded. Acquired mutations are often
implicated in this process, but our findings suggest that cross-talk between the tumor cells
and neighboring ECs subverts the tumor vascular niche and instigates the aggressive
chemoresistant phenotype of IGF1R+ TSCs. Chemotherapy induces aggressive tumor cells
to upregulate FGF4 that then stimulates TEC FGFR1 and induces ETS2-dependent IGF1
upregulation and IGFBP7 suppression. It is conceivable that while chemotherapy eradicates
the majority of tumor cells, chemoresistant perivascular IGF1R+ TSCs co-opt neighboring
ECs by inducing them to upregulate production of pro-tumorigenic angiocrine factors that
reinforce chemoresistance and promote tumor recurrence and lethality. As such, we have
unraveled a mechanism by which aggressive TSCs subjugate tumor-associated vascular
niche.

Author Manuscript

Reversal of the maladapted function of the tumor vascular niche by selectively silencing
tumorigenic or restoring niche-derived inhibitory cues is a promising therapeutic strategy.
This approach would allow for modulating specific angiocrine factors instead of disrupting
tumor vascular supply that paradoxically leads to rebound angiogenesis and tumor growth.
This approach might be timely for designing effective cancer treatment because previous
anti-angiogenic approaches aiming to abrogate tumor blood vessel growth have had limited
success (Bogdanovich et al., 2016; Ebos et al., 2009; Paez-Ribes et al., 2009; Yasuma et al.,
2016). Our data could potentially have clinical implications in which anti-IGF1R antibody
along with IGFBP7 agonists could be employed in conjunction with chemotherapeutic
agents to block IGF1R+ TSCs (Wilky et al., 2015). As such, this study might help to design
effective anti-chemoresistance strategy by disrupting crosstalk between cancer stem cells
and their aberrantly activated vascular niche.

Experimental procedures
Animals

Author Manuscript

Generation of mice with deletion of Igfbp7/angiomodulin was previously described (Hooper
et al., 2009). DN-03 anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) PDTX Mouse model was
generated as previously described (Cheng et al., 2012). Igfbp7−/− mice were generated with
proper mendelian ratio without salient embryonic lethality. Eμ-Myc mice were crossed with
Igfbp7−/− mice to generate Myc+Igfbp7−/− or Myc+Igfbp7+/+ mice. Floxed Fgfr1 or Igf1
(Jax No. 016831) mice were crossed with VE-cadherin-CreERT2 (cdh5-PAC-CreERT2)
transgenic mice (kindly provided by Dr. Ralf H. Adams), and resultant VE-cadherinCreERT2Fgfr1loxp/loxp or VE-cadherin-CreERT2Igf1loxp/loxp mice were treated with tamoxifen
to induce EC-specific deletion of Fgfr1 or Igf1 in the adult mice. Briefly, mice were treated
with tamoxifen at a dose of 150 mg/kg i.p. for 6 days interrupted for 3 days after the third
dose. Deletion of target genes in tumor ECs was corroborated by quantitative PCR and
immunoblot analysis. All animal experiments were approved by Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) at Weill Cornell Medicine.

In vitro serum/cytokine free co-culture of tumor cells and ECs

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

HUVECs were transduced with the adenoviral E4ORF1 gene, which activates low level of
Akt signaling pathway and endows ECs with the ability of surviving in serum/cytokine free
environment (Cao et al., 2014; Seandel et al., 2008). E4-HUVECs establish a resilient,
responsive and unbiased generic vascular niche model to maintain tumor cell survival in
serum/growth factor free environment without distractive effects from serum
supplementation. E4-HUVECs are referred here for simplicity as ECs. shRNA-mediated
gene knockdown was utilized to selectively knock down IGF1, FGFR1 in ECs and FGF4
and IGF1R in tumor cells. Lentiviruses were generated by co-transfecting 15 μg of shuttle
lentiviral vector containing specific gene-targeted shRNA or scrambled shRNA (Cao et al.,
2014). For serum/growth factor-free co-culture experiments, Srb-transduced ECs or ECs
with genetic silencing of IGF1 and FGFR1 were cultured in 6 well plate at 1x105 cells/well.
Tumor cell clones were seeded on top of the monolayer formed by ECs at 1000 cells/well.
After 8 or 12 days after co-culture, the number of tumor cell was quantified by flow
cytometric analysis.
Assay for chemoresistance of tumor cells
To measure chemoresistance in vitro, LCs and HCCs were derived from Eμ-Myc and LapMyc mice, as previously described (Cao et al., 2014; Cao et al., 2011; Shachaf et al., 2004).
The cells were treated with 0.005–0.01 μg/ml doxorubicin. The percentage of dead cells was
distinguished with 0.4% trypan blue solution. Cell lines exhibiting high chemoresistance
were named as line 1 to line 5. Cell line manifesting the lowest tolerance to doxorubicin was
named as line 6.

Author Manuscript

Two million LCs, HCCs, and LLCs were transplanted to mice deficient of endothelial Igf1
(Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC), Fgfr1 (Fgf1iΔEC/iΔEC) and Igfbp7 (Igfbp7−/−). To test the response in
different vascular beds, LCs and HCCs were injected into the liver vasculature by a liver
seeding model (Ding et al., 2011), and LCs and LLCs were administered via jugular vein. To
measure chemoresistance in vivo, mice were treated with 10 mg/kg doxorubicin, 5-FU, or 5
mg/kg cisplatin once a week at day 7 after transplantation. Effect of doxorubicin, 5-FU and
cisplatin was analyzed in recipient mice, including tumor load and animal survival.
To test the therapeutic effect of recombinant IGFBP7 (R&D) or IGF1R neutralizing
antibody (Santa Cruz, clone 1H7), 10 ug IGFBP7 was injected into the tumor carrying mice
every three days at day 7 after tumor transplantation. Meanwhile, 20 μg antibody and isotype
IgG was also administered every week to determine the effect on mouse survival and tumor
load.

Author Manuscript

To test cell death and proliferation in lymphoma, mice were sacrificed and cryopreserved
sections were incubated with the mixture of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase,
nucleotide and reaction buffer as indicated by TUNEL In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit
(Roche). Tumor load was calculated by percent of tumor area, and tumor area was identified
by neoplastic morphology distinct from normal tissue. Images were captured with AxioVert
LSM710 confocal microscope (Zeiss).

Methylcellulose colony assay

Author Manuscript

LCs isolated from Eμ-Myc mice were suspended in methylcellulose medium (StemCell
Technologies) at the concentration of 500 cells/ml as previously described. The mixture was
seeded in 6 well plate and incubated in 37°C for 5 days. The colony number was counted.
Cell isolation

Author Manuscript

Mouse endothelial cells and tumor cells were isolated from tumor mass by flow sorting as
previously described (Cao et al., 2016; Nolan et al., 2013; Rafii et al., 2015). TECs and
tumor cells were identified by rat anti-mouse CD31 (clone Mec13.3) and VE-cadherin
(clone Bv13) antibodies (for TECs) and mCherry fluorescent protein (for tumor cells).
Tumor tissue was digested in a digestion cocktail solution containing 2 mg/ml collogenase A
and 1 mg/ml Dispase (Roche Life Science) in Hanks’ Balanced Salted Solution (HBSS).
Perfused mouse tumor tissues were carefully removed and dissected in RPMI1640 medium
(Life Technologies), gently minced, and disrupted by passing through a 18 Gauge syringe.
After filtration, released cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml fluorescently labeled rat-anti
mouse VE-cadherin and CD31 antibodies for flow sorting. Fluorescent antibody-stained
cells were collected using a flow sorter, and isolated TECs or tumor cells were directly
subjected to subsequent analyses, unless specified as cultivated cells. Phosphorylated Akt
and IGF1R was analyzed by Western blot (Cell Signaling, Cat No. 4060 and 4568). All
presented lanes in one Western blot strip were derived and adjusted equally from the same
corresponding blot. The flow cytometry data were collected by LSRII flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences) and analyzed by as previously described (Cao et al., 2014).
Immunostaining analysis of mouse tissue

Author Manuscript

Mouse tissue was fixed with 4% PFA, cryopreserved, and processed with Leica CM3050 S
to 8 μm slice. The sections were blocked with 5% donkey serum/0.3% Triton X-100 and
incubated with primary antibody against VE-Cadherin (R&D Systems), IGF1R and
phosphor-IGF1R (Cell Signaling Technology), and Ki67 (DAKO). Sections were then
incubated with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch),
followed by counterstaining with DAPI (Invitrogen). Images were captured with AxioVert
LSM710 confocal microscope (Zeiss).
Statistical analysis of data
All data were presented as the mean ± standard error of mean (SEM) of at least three
separate experiments. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare groups in Kaplan
Meier graphs. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.

Significance
Stem cell-like features of tumors are thought to be cell-autonomous. Our data challenge
this hypothesis and support an alternative model wherein maladapted tumor-associatedvascular endothelial cells (TECs) constitute a subverted vascular niche that confers stem
cell-like activity to indolent tumor cells. Abnormal activation of FGFR1-ETS2 pathway
in TECs enforces aggressiveness and chemoresistance in multiple mouse and human
tumor models. Subversion of TECs to form this pro-tumorigenic vascular niche relies on
a "two-hit" mechanism: downregulation of tumor suppressor/checkpoint IGFBP7 and
upregulation of IGF1. Imbalanced IGFBP7 and IGF1 angiocrine expression in TECs
induces generation and engraftment of cancer stem cell-like cells. Thus, our study defines
a molecular hub that coopts TECs to form a tumor vascular-niche inducing a cancer stem
cell phenotype.

(E) Expression of IGF1R in human patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) model. Human
patient-derived lymphoma cells were engrafted into immunodeficient mice as described
(Cheng et al., 2012). Immunostaining of IGF1R was performed in lymphoma tissue from
PDTX mice that received control or CHOP chemotherapy regimen, cyclophosphamide,
hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, and prednisolone. Note the proximity between IGF1R+ LCs
expressing human CD45 with VE-cadherin+ tumor-associated ECs (TECs) in the PDTX
mice. Scale bar = 50 μm in Figure 1.
(F–G) Cell apoptosis and proliferation in isolated IGF1R+ LCs transplanted into wild-type
(WT) mice. LCs with IGF1R knockdown (shIGF1R) were transplanted to recipient mice and
compared with LCs transduced with scrambled sequence (Srb). Cell death after
chemotherapy was examined by TUNEL staining and proliferation was measured by Ki67
staining in lymphoma cryosections. Of note, there was a higher extent of apoptosis
(TUNEL) in shIGF1R-transduced LCs. In contrast, there was no significant difference in
cell proliferation between different groups, as evidenced by Ki67 staining.
(H) Survival curve of different groups of tumor cells after transplantation into mice with
(+Chemo) or without (-Chemo) doxorubicin treatment. Mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.)
injected with LCs, HCCs, or intravenously (i.v.) injected with LLCs. Tumor cells were
transduced with shIGF1R or Srb; p < 0.05 between shIGF1R+Chemo group and all other
groups; n = 10–12 mice per group.
(I–J) Expression of IGF1R and in vivo chemoresistance in transplanted tumor cells. IGF1R
function was tested by gene overexpression (OE) or shRNA (shIGF1R) (I). LCs and HCCs
were transplanted to the liver of mice by intrasplenic injection, and LCs and LLCs were
transplanted into the mouse lungs via intravenous infusion. Mice were treated with
doxorubicin, and hepatic and pulmonary tumor load in different groups were then analyzed
(J).

(A) Resistance to doxorubicin treatment in LCs after co-culture with mouse liver, thymus,
lung, and pancreas ECs. Number of viable lymphoma cell number after doxorubicin
treatment was compared with LCs treated with vehicle after one week co-culture with ECs;
n = 6 per group.
(B, C) IGF1 from liver ECs endows IGF1R-dependent resistance against doxorubicin. IGF1
expressed by liver ECs augmented expansion of chemoresistant IGF1R+ LCs than did
pancreas, thymus and lung ECs. shRNA knockdown of IGF1 (shIGF1) in liver ECs
attenuated expansion of LCs to a comparable level caused by pancreas, thymus and lung
ECs, or knocking down IGF1R (shIGF1R) in LCs (C); n = 5 per group.

were i.v. injected to recipient mice. Survival of recipient mice was monitored upon
doxorubicin (Chemo+) or vehicle (Chemo-) treatment. Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC mice were generated
by crossing floxed Igf1 mice with mice harboring EC-specific VE-cadherin-CreERT2
(cdh5(PAC)-CreERT2); p < 0.05 between Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC+Chemo group and all other groups; n
= 11–13 mice per group.
(E–F) Influence of endothelial cell supplied IGF1 on chemoresistance of tumor cells
transplanted in different vascular beds. LCs and HCCs were transplanted into the liver of
Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC or control Igf1iΔEC/+ mice by intrasplenic injection, LCs and LLCs were also
i.v. transplanted into the lung of Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC or control mice. After mice were treated with
doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and cisplatin, hepatic and pulmonary tumor load were
analyzed (E), and level of total and activated (phosphorylated) IGF1R in isolated tumor cells
was tested by Western blot (F). Scale bar = 50 μm; n = 8–9 mice per group.

(C) Cell death in lymphoma mass of Myc+Igf1iΔEC/+ and Myc+Igf1iΔEC/iΔEC mice after
chemotherapy.
(D) Eμ-Myc mice were crossed with Igfbp7−/− mice. Survival of generated Myc+Igfbp7+/+
and Myc+Igfbp7−/− mice was compared with or without doxorubicin treatment; n = 10–13
mice per group.
(E) Phosphorylation of IGF1R (p-IGF1R) in developed LCs of Myc+Igfbp7+/+ and
Myc+Igfbp7−/− mice.
(F–G) Cell death (F) and Akt activation (G) were compared in lymphoma mass of
Myc+Igfbp7+/+ and Myc+Igfbp7−/− mice after chemotherapy.
(H) TECs deploy a core "two-hit" angiocrine mechanism to transform indolent tumors into
aggressive and chemoresistant TSCs. In response to tumor development, TECs express
paracrine “checkpoint” IGFBP7 to restrain the aggressive features of TSCs. While
chemotherapy eradicates the majority of tumor cells, aggressive IGF1R+ TSCs supply FGF4
to activate FGFR1-ETS2 axis in TECs, causing suppression of IGFBP7 and upregulation of
IGF1 in TECs. Loss of suppressive paracrine checkpoint in TECs instigates cancer stem
cell-like features in associated tumor cells such as chemoresistance.
