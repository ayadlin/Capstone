ABSTRACT:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common tumor type with a high mortality rate, in part
due to intrinsic drug resistance. Although bevacizumab, a VEGF-directed neutralizing
antibody, is particularly active in this pathology, some patients never respond for
reasons not well understood. We here wish to clarify the role of autocrine VEGF
signaling in the response of CRC cells to angiogenesis inhibition. Our results show that
CRC cells with intrinsic bevacizumab-resistance displayed pronounced upregulation of
autocrine HIF-VEGF-VEGFR signaling in response to prolonged bevacizumab exposure
whereas the same signaling pathway was downregulated in bevacizumab-sensitive
xenografts. Importantly, both bevacizumab-sensitive and -resistant CRC xenografts
were sensitive to nintedanib, a small molecule angiokinase inhibitor, which was
associated with inhibition of mTORC1. In vitro studies revealed that bevacizumabresistant cells displayed intrinsically higher HIF-VEGF signaling intensity and hypoxia
tolerance compared to their bevacizumab-sensitive counterparts. Interestingly,
although nintedanib showed comparable activity toward bevacizumab-sensitive cells
under normoxia and hypoxia, the drug was three-fold more toxic to the resistant
cells under hypoxia, suggesting that nintedanib attenuated the survival signaling
that usually protects these cells from hypoxia-mediated cell death. In conclusion,
our findings support a role for autocrine VEGF signaling in the survival of CRC cells
to hypoxia and thus to angiogenesis inhibition. We further show that nintedanib,
a small molecule angiokinase inhibitor, is active toward CRC models with intrinsic
bevacizumab resistance supporting clinical trials of nintedanib in patients that do
not respond to bevacizumab, alone or in combination with bevacizumab to increase
angiogenesis inhibition.

INTRODUCTION

inhibitors. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (hereafter
referred to as VEGF) is a key regulator of angiogenesis.
Amplification of the VEGF locus is observed in a subset
of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)
and is associated with a remarkably aggressive disease
characterized by a high incidence of vascular invasion

Neovascularization (sprouting angiogenesis) is
required for the growth of most solid tumors and facilitates
the spread of tumor cells to secondary sites [1] providing
a rational basis for the clinical use of angiogenesis

[2]. Recent data from more than 2000 mCRC patients
indicate that high baseline plasma levels of VEGF might
be a negative prognostic factor for both progression-free
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) [3]. Therefore,
VEGF signaling is linked to invasiveness and aggressive
disease in CRC and appears as an attractive therapeutic
target.
Several VEGF(R)-targeted agents are approved
or are undergoing clinical trials for treatment of CRC.
Bevacizumab (avastin), a VEGF-neutralizing monoclonal
antibody [4], was the first angiogenesis inhibitor to be
approved and represents the current benchmark. Although
bevacizumab shows excellent activity in some patients,
others never respond, for reasons not well understood.
Nintedanib (BIBF 1120) is a small molecule tyrosine
kinase inhibitor that inhibits several angiokinases
including VEGFR1/Flt1, VEGFR2/Flk1/KDR and
VEGFR3/Flt4 as well as FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3,
PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta and Flt3 [5]. Nintedanib
is currently in phase III clinical trials in ovarian and
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), where it has been
successful in combination with taxotere [6].
Although the mechanism of angiogenesis inhibitors
is not fully elucidated, it is generally believed that pruning
of the tumor microvasculature will decrease blood supply
thereby diminishing tumor oxygenation and promoting
tumor cell death [7-11]. Hypoxia is accompanied
by activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription
factors HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha leading to increased
expression of VEGF and other HIF targets [12, 13].
Binding of VEGF to its receptors triggers signaling
pathways that modulate the phosphorylation, stability and/
or activity of a variety of down-stream targets including
HIF and VEGF [14-17], thereby initiating a positive feedback loop. Thus, HIF-VEGF signaling intensity emerges
as a key factor in determining the outcome of angiogenesis
inhibition.
A striking feature of CRC is the capacity for both
paracrine and autocrine VEGF-signaling. CRC cells are a
major source of VEGF that interacts with VEGF receptors
on tumor-associated endothelial cells thereby stimulating
their growth, migration and survival [18]. In addition,
CRC cells express VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) giving rise
to autocrine VEGF signaling [19]. Results from different
laboratories indicate that most, if not all, human CRC
cells and tumors express functional VEGFR1 [20-23]
as well as VEGFR2 [24-26]. Autocrine VEGF signaling
promotes CRC survival under different types of stress
including 5-fluorouracil exposure, low serum conditions
and anchorage-independent growth [27-29]. Interestingly,
VEGFR1-mediated VEGF signaling may be particularly
important for the survival of invasive CRC cells that have
undergone the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and no
longer benefit from homotypic cell-cell contact [20].
Until now, most studies on both intrinsic and

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

acquired bevacizumab resistance have focused on
paracrine VEGF signaling and tumor-associated
endothelial cells. However, the capacity of autocrine
VEGF-signaling to promote CRC cell survival under
different types of stress suggests that this pathway may
also play a role during angiogenesis inhibition.
We now report that bevacizumab-resistant, but
not bevacizumab-sensitive, CRC cells showed strong
autocrine HIF-VEGF-VEGFR signaling in response to
prolonged bevacizumab exposure in vivo and displayed
intrinsically higher HIF-VEGF signaling intensity and
hypoxia tolerance in vitro. We further show that tumors
with intrinsic bevacizumab resistance remain sensitive to
nintedanib, a small molecule angiokinase inhibitor. These
data suggest that the antitumor activity of at least some
small molecule angiokinase inhibitors is not limited by the
mechanisms underlying natural bevacizumab resistance
and provide a rational for clinical trials of nintedanib in
CRC patients that do not respond to bevacizumab, alone or
in combination with bevacizumab to increase angiogenesis
inhibition.

RESULTS
HT-29 xenografts are naturally bevacizumabresistant but remain sensitive to nintedanib, a
small molecule angiokinase inhibitor.
Continued bevacizumab treatment of mice carrying
human CRC xenografts revealed that HT-29 tumors are
naturally bevacizumab-resistant with only 29% growth
inhibition after 4 weeks drug exposure while the same
scheduling resulted in 68% tumor growth inhibition for
the bevacizumab-sensitive DLD-1 tumors (Figure 1A).
To establish if bevacizumab resistance is associated
with cross-resistance to small molecules targeting the
same pathways, nintedanib was administered to animals
with DLD-1 or HT-29 xenografts. The results show that
nintedanib displays comparable tumor growth inhibitory
activity in the two tumor models (Figure 1A). No weight
loss or other toxic side effects were noted for either
bevacizumab or nintedanib (data not shown). Therefore,
CRC tumors with intrinsic bevacizumab resistance remain
sensitive to at least some small molecule angiokinase
inhibitors.

Bevacizumab-resistant xenografts express high
levels of VEGF.
Since bevacizumab and nintedanib both interfere
with VEGF signaling, tissue extracts were prepared from
untreated DLD-1 and HT-29 tumors and the concentration

of human VEGF was determined by ELISA analysis
(Figure 1B). The amounts of VEGF were at least 4 times
higher in tumor tissues from HT-29 xenografts compared
to DLD-1 xenografts (942 pg vs. 223 pg VEGF/µg protein,
respectively, p < 0,001).
Bevacizumab is specific for human VEGF, and
will therefore only neutralize VEGF produced by the
tumor cells, but not murine VEGF secreted by the tumorassociated stromal cells. To evaluate the contribution
of stromal VEGF, tissue extracts were prepared from
untreated DLD-1 and HT-29 tumors and the concentration
of murine VEGF was determined by ELISA analysis. The
results show that murine VEGF represents a minor fraction
of the total VEGF (0,4 to 1.1%) in both tumor models
(Figure 1B). Therefore, VEGF signaling is principally
mediated by human, tumor-derived VEGF in both DLD-1
and HT-29 xenografts.

The microvascular density of DLD-1 and HT-29
xenografts was compared by IHC with a CD31-directed
antibody followed by quantitative image analysis. The
results (Figure 1C) indicate that bevacizumab reduces
the microvascular density by 70% in DLD-1 xenografts,
compared to the vehicle control. In contrast, the same
schedule of bevacizumab only reduced the microvascular
density by 27% in HT-29 xenografts. These results show
that the microvascular density was less influenced by
bevacizumab in the bevacizumab-resistant xenografts
whereas nintedanib had comparable activity in the two
models.

effects without any striking differences between them:
37% vs 33% decrease in DNA synthesis, 265% vs 299%
increased apoptosis, and 236% vs 209% increased necrosis
for bevacizumab and nintedanib, respectively (Figure 2).
We then compared the influence of nintedanib
in the two tumor models. Interestingly, both doses of
nintedanib induced more apoptosis in HT-29 tumors
(299% and 640%, for the low and high dose of nintedanib,
respectively) than in DLD-1 tumors (126% and 178%,
for the low and high dose of nintedanib, respectively),
whereas the induction of necrosis was comparable (Figure
2).
Taken together, our findings indicate that treatment
with both bevacizumab and nintedanib resulted in
a mixture of cytostatic and cytotoxic effects. The
pronounced apoptosis in nintedanib-treated HT-29 tumors
suggests that nintedanib may not only display antivascular
effects in vivo but also be able to interfere with survival
signaling in the CRC cells.

Tumor growth inhibition may be due to both
cytostatic (cell cycle arrest) and cytotoxic (cell death)
effects. We therefore evaluated the influence of
bevacizumab and nintedanib on in vivo DNA synthesis
(EdU incorporation), apoptotic cell death (TUNEL assay)
and necrotic cell death (Figure 2).
We first compared the influence of the two drugs.
In DLD-1 xenografts, bevacizumab and nintedanib (50
mg/kg) have comparable antitumor activity. Both agents
displayed a mixture of cytotostatic and cytotoxic effects
without any striking differences between them: 43%
vs 46% decrease in DNA synthesis as determined by
EdU, 197% vs 178% increase in apoptotic cell death as
determined by TUNEL, and 480% vs 353% increased
necrosis for bevacizumab and nintedanib, respectively.
(Figure 2). In HT-29 xenografts, bevacizumab and low
dose nintedanib have comparable antitumor activity. Both
agents displayed a mixture of cytostatic and cytotoxic

Animals with CRC xenografts were dosed with vehicle (Control), bevacizumab at 5 mg/kg i.p. every 3 days (Beva), nintedanib at 12,5 mg/

treatments with comparable antitumor activity, for most
markers (Figure 3), although the downregulation of HIF2alpha was more marked for nintedanib-treated tumors
than for bevacizumab-treated tumors. In clear contrast,
for HT-29 tumors, the signal for all markers was up to
3-fold higher following bevacizumab exposure than after
exposure to nintedanib (12,5 mg/kg), in spite of their
comparable antitumor and antivascular activities. In
particular, for the nintedanib- and bevacizumab-treated
tumors, the signal for pVEGFR1 was 110% vs 192% while
the signal for pVEGFR2 was 75% vs 205%, respectively.
These findings likely reflect a direct inhibitory effect of
nintedanib on the tumor cell-associated VEGF receptors,
consistent with the potent angiokinase inhibitory activity
of this compound.
Taken together, these results reveal both tumor- and
drug-specific differences with respect to HIF-VEGFVEGFR signaling. For the bevacizumab-sensitive
DLD-1 tumors, all treatments were accompanied by
downregulation of the HIF-VEGF-VEGFR axis whereas

Microvascular pruning limits oxygen supply to
the tumor thereby activating the hypoxia-inducible
transcription factors, HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha. This
is accompanied by transcriptional upregulation of HIF
targets like VEGF, thereby promoting autocrine VEGF
signaling. The presence of HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, VEGF
and the active autophosphorylated forms of VEGFR1
and VEGFR2 in the two xenograft models was revealed
by IHC followed by quantitative image analysis (Figure
3). The results revealed striking differences between
DLD-1 and HT-29 xenografts, since all treatments were
accompanied by attenuation of the HIF-VEGF-VEGFR
axis in DLD-1 tumors, but activation of the same signaling
components in HT-29 xenografts.
For DLD-1 tumors, there were no marked differences
between nintedanib (50 mg/kg) and bevacizumab, two

the same treatments resulted in activation of autocrine
VEGF signaling in the bevacizumab-resistant HT-29
tumors. Furthermore, for HT-29 tumors, bevacizumab
treatment was associated with much stronger activation
of autocrine VEGF signaling than was the case for
nintedanib.

VEGF receptors and other RTKs mediate multiple
downstream signaling pathways that may be integrated
at the level of mTORC1, the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 [30]. Recent findings
suggest that inhibition of mTORC1 activity, as measured
by tumor levels of Ser240/Ser244-phosphorylated S6
(pS6) is a robust biomarker for the antitumor activity of
at least some protein kinase inhibitors such as inhibitors
of mutant BRAF and PI3K [31, 32]. In the present study,
all treatments reduced the expression of pS6 in DLD-1
tumors, which was most pronounced for bevacizumab
and nintedanib at the 50 mg/kg dose (Figure 3). In HT29 tumors, nintedanib induced a marked, dose-dependent
decrease of pS6 levels reaching 12% for the high dose
of nintedanib, compared to the vehicle control. In clear
contrast, bevacizumab increased the levels of pS6 to
~130% in the same xenograft model.

Bevacizumab and nintedanib show synergistic
activity toward bevacizumab-resistant xenografts.
The important differences in the activities of
bevacizumab and nintedanib toward HT-29 xenografts
prompted us to explore the combination of the two agents
(Figure 4). Bevacizumab and low dose nintedanib showed
comparable activity toward HT-29 xenografts as single
agents with approximately 27% tumor growth inhibition.
In comparison, the combination of bevacizumab and
nintedanib was accompanied by 65% tumor growth
inhibition (p < 0,001, bevacizumab alone vs bevacizumab
and nintedanib). The combination was active toward both
endothelial and tumor cells. The microvascular density,
as determined by CD31 staining, decreased by ~28%
when bevacizumab or nintedanib were given alone, to
63% when the two agents were given together (p < 0,001,
bevacizumab alone vs bevacizumab and nintedanib). In
addition, nintedanib was able to counteract the activation
of mTORC1 in the tumor cells, as measured by pS6,
from 131% (compared to the vehicle control) when
bevacizumab was given alone to 72% when the two agents
were given together (p < 0,001, bevacizumab alone vs
bevacizumab and nintedanib).

signaling, or rather if HIF signaling intensity in DLD-1

tumors is weak compared to HT-29 tumors. To answer
this question, DLD-1 and HT-29 cells were exposed to
acute hypoxia (1% O2) for 24 hrs and the expression of
HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha was determined by Western
blot analysis. The results show that the expression of the
two HIF proteins is marginal under normoxia. In contrast,

24 hrs hypoxia is accompanied by HIF-1alpha induction
in both cell lines whereas the expression of HIF-2alpha
remains marginal (Figure 5A).
To establish if the HIF-1alpha protein was
transcriptionally active, the expression of its downstream
target, VEGF, was determined by qRT-PCR. Acute
hypoxia was accompanied by a ~10-fold increase in
VEGF expression for HT-29 cells, compared to the
corresponding normoxic cells, whereas the corresponding
increase in VEGF expression was ~3.5-fold for DLD-1
cells. Therefore, DLD-1 cells show a functional hypoxia
response as indicated by upregulation of VEGF mRNA,
although to a lesser degree than HT-29 (Figure 5B).

Bevacizumab and nintedanib upregulate HIF1alpha in both bevasizumab-sensitive and
-resistant cells.
We next explored if angiogenesis inhibitors might
have a direct effect on HIF-VEGF signaling in CRC cells.
Our results indicate that the presence of nintedanib or
bevacizumab had no detectable effect on the expression
of HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha under normoxia (Figure
5A). However, under hypoxia, nintedanib activated the
expression of HIF-1alpha in a dose-dependent manner
in both cell lines (2 to 3-fold, compared to the normoxia
control) (Figure 5A). In addition, bevacizumab was able

to induce HIF-1alpha almost 4-fold in the HT-29 cells
whereas its influence was marginal in DLD-1 cells (Figure
5A).
The drug-induced increase of HIF-1alpha protein
had modest influence on the expression of VEGF mRNA
in hypoxic DLD-1 cells (Figure 5B). In clear contrast,
for hypoxic HT-29 cells, nintedanib-exposure was
accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in mRNA
VEGF expression that reached ~2,4 times the levels of
the untreated controls, whereas bevacizumab increased
mRNA VEGF expression ~1.8-fold. Therefore, although
drug exposure was associated with increased HIF-1alpha
accumulation under short-term hypoxia in both cell lines,
VEGF mRNA expression was only increased for HT-29
cells.

days) exposure to the angiokinase inhibitor nintedanib
showed that DLD-1 and HT-29 xenografts are both
sensitive to nintedanib at doses with no detectable toxic
side effects. These findings suggest that the antitumor
activity of at least some small molecule angiokinase
inhibitors is not limited by the mechanisms underlying
natural bevacizumab resistance.
Next, we characterized the differences between
bevacizumab-sensitive and -resistant cells, with special
attention to VEGF signaling. Comparison of the vascular
density in DLD-1 and HT-29 tumors by IHC analysis
reveals that bevacizumab treatment is associated with
important vascular pruning in the sensitive DLD1, but not in the resistant HT-29 xenografts. In clear
contrast, nintedanib showed comparable effects on the
microvascular density in both xenograft models. To
establish if the intrinsic bevacizumab resistance of HT-29
xenografts might be linked to elevated levels of stromaderived VEGF, the concentrations of human and murine
VEGF were determined. The results show that for both
tumor types, murine VEGF represents, at the most, 1%
of the total amount of VEGF and is therefore unlikely
to influence the response to angiogenesis inhibition.
Interestingly, HT-29 tumors express at least four times
more human VEGF, compared to the DLD-1 tumors,
which likely contributes to the bevacizumab-resistant
phenotype.
To establish the mechanistic basis for tumor
growth inhibition, the levels of DNA synthesis, apoptosis
and necrosis were determined. The results show that
prolonged exposure to the two drugs resulted in a
mixture of cytostatic and cytotoxic effects, independent
of the tumor model. However, nintedanib exposure was
associated with significantly more apoptosis in HT-29 than
in DLD-1 xenografts, suggesting that in this tumor model,
nintedanib may not only act on the microvasculature, but
also attenuate the survival response of the tumor cells to
environmental stress.
To characterize the signaling intensity of the HIFVEGF signaling pathway (summarized in Figure 6),
the expression of HIF-1alpha, HIF-2alpha, VEGF and
the active, autophosphorylated forms of VEGFR1 and
VEGFR2 was determined by IHC followed by quantitative
image analysis. The results revealed striking differences
between the two tumor models. Drug treatment was
accompanied by a general downregulation of all signaling
components of the HIF-VEGF-VEGFR autocrine loop in
DLD-1 tumors, in clear contrast to HT-29 tumors, where
the same pathway was upregulated. Interestingly, for HT29 tumors, treatment with bevacizumab was accompanied
by much higher activation of autocrine VEGF signaling
than nintedanib, thereby identifying a key difference
between the two agents.
mTORC1 integrates multiple signaling pathways
downstream of activated receptor tyrosine kinases.
Accordingly, recent findings suggest that the degree of

Bevacizumab-resistant cells show increased
hypoxia tolerance.
Next, DLD-1 and HT-29 cells were exposed to
hypoxia for up to 48 hrs and the fraction of apoptotic
cells was determined by the TUNEL assay (Figure
5C left). The results show that hypoxia exposure was
accompanied by rapid apoptosis in DLD-1 cells to reach
almost 17% apoptotic cells by 48 hrs, whereas the level
of apoptosis stayed below 5% for HT-29. These findings
were confirmed by a caspase 3 assay that measures the
formation of catalytically active cleaved caspase 3 (Figure
5C right).

Nintedanib shows increased toxicity toward
bevacizumab-resistant cells under hypoxia.
To determine the influence of hypoxia on nintedanib
toxicity, cells were exposed to different doses of nintedanib
for 24 hrs under hypoxia or normoxia followed by 96 hrs
post-exposure under normoxia and MTT determination.
The results show that nintedanib is slightly (~30%)
more toxic for DLD-1 cells under hypoxia compared to
normoxia (Figure 5D left). In comparison, nintedanib was
almost 3 times more toxic to HT-29 cells under hypoxia,
suggesting that nintedanib attenuates the survival signaling
that usually protects HT-29 from hypoxia-mediated cell
death (Figure 5D right).

DISCUSSION
Bevacizumab shows excellent activity in a subset
of mCRC patients while others never respond. A key
question is if bevacizumab-resistance is limited to this
particular agent or rather is indicative of a general
resistance to angiogenesis inhibition. To clarify this
question, we identified the HT-29 xenograft model as
naturally bevacizumab-resistant in contrast to DLD-1
xenografts that are bevacizumab-sensitive. Prolonged (28

mTORC1 activity, as determined by the levels of the
Ser240/Ser244 phosphorylated form of the ribosomal
S6 protein (pS6), serve as a robust biomarker for the
antitumor activity of at least some signaling pathways
inhibitors. Quantitative IHC analysis showed that
treatment with both bevacizumab and nintedanib was
accompanied by downregulation of mTORC1 activity in
DLD-1 tumors. In clear contrast, bevacizumab exposure
was associated with upregulation of mTORC1 activity
in HT-29 tumors whereas nintedanib treatment was
associated with a marked decrease of mTORC1 activity,
compared to the vehicle control. For the bevacizumabtreated HT-29 tumors, the increase in mTORC1
activity is fully coherent with the elevated levels of
active, phosphorylated VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. In
contrast, the strong downregulation of mTORC1 in the
nintedanib-treated HT-29 tumors was unexpected. The
downregulation is unlikely to rely on VEGF-signaling
alone, but likely involves other nintedanib targets like
FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor) and PDGF
(platelet-derived growth factor receptor receptor) family
members [5].
Another unexpected finding was that HIF-1alpha
was upregulated in the nintedanib-treated HT-29 tumors
in spite of the marked downregulation of mTORC1,
a well-established negative regulator of HIF-1alpha
translation. The upregulation of HIF-1alpha is coherent
with the loss of tumor-associated microvessels that
results in tumor hypoxia and activation of autocrine
VEGF signaling. Furthermore, it should be noted that the
regulation of HIF-1alpha is complex and is mediated at
several levels including transcription, translation as well
as protein stability. Even on the translational level, our
previous results suggest that HIF-1alpha expression can
be modulated by (at least) two different agents, rapamycin
via mTORC1, and irinotecan, that acts in a mTORC1independent manner [33].
Interestingly, the beva-resistance of the HT-29
xenografts could be overcome by combining bevacizumab
with low dose nintedanib. The additional antitumor effect
was characterized by a diminution, rather than an increase,
of mTORC1 activity as well as by increased inhibition of
the tumor microvasculature.
A crucial question is if bevacizumab-sensitive
cells are unable to activate HIF-signaling in response
to hypoxia, unable to maintain HIF activation, or if the
HIF signaling pathway is functional, but less prominent
compared to bevacizumab-resistant cells. To answer this
question, DLD-1 and HT-29 cells were incubated under
hypoxia for 24 hrs and the induction of HIF-1alpha and
HIF-2alpha was determined. The results show that both
cell lines express little, if any, HIF-1alpha or HIF-2alpha
under normoxia. In contrast, hypoxia is accompanied by
robust HIF-1alpha induction in both cell lines whereas the
induction of HIF-2alpha is marginal. These findings are
coherent with previous work reporting that HIF-1alpha
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

drives the initial response to hypoxia whereas HIF2alpha is needed for the chronic response [34]. Next, we
determined the capacity of HIF to increase the expression
of VEGF mRNA. The results reveal that although VEGF
was induced by hypoxia in both cell lines, the increase in
VEGF levels was more prominent for HT-29 cells (~10fold increase) than for DLD-1 cells (~3-fold increase).
Interestingly, the differences in VEGF expression in vitro
were comparable to the differences in VEGF expression
observed for the corresponding xenografts. Therefore,
the in vivo differences in basal VEGF levels appear to be
a result of an intrinsically higher HIF-VEGF signaling
intensity in bevacizumab-resistant cells.
Unexpectedly, the hypoxia-mediated up-regulation
of HIF-1alpha protein was further increased in the
presence of nintedanib and bevacizumab, suggesting
that the two agents can influence tumor cells directly
under cellular stress. The activity of nintedanib is
consistent with previous findings, where nintedanib was
shown to modulate cell cycle progression and viability
of a wide range of CRC cell lines [35]. The influence
of bevacizumab is more unexpected considering that
bevacizumab is a ligand-targeted agent that is unable
to enter the tumor cells. However, two recent articles
report that chronic in vitro exposure of CRC cells to
bevacizumab was accompanied by the emergence of a
more migratory and invasive phenotype [36, 37], which is
coherent with a direct effect of bevacizumab on the tumor
cells, as observed here.
HT-29 cells were more resistant to hypoxia-induced
apoptosis compared to DLD-1 cells consistent with their
bevacizumab-resistant phenotype in vivo. If the increased
survival of HT-29 cells under hypoxia depends on their
potent kinase activity including autocrine VEGF-signaling,
we would predict that nintedanib should be more cytotoxic
under hypoxic conditions than under normoxia. In
contrast, we would expect a smaller difference for DLD1 cells that are inherently hypoxia-sensitive and appear
to have weaker angiokinase signaling. In agreement,
the results showed almost three-fold increased activity
of nintedanib under hypoxia in HT-29 cells, whereas
nintedanib was only marginally more active under hypoxia
toward DLD-1 cells. The increased activity of nintedanib
under hypoxia is a noticeable feature, since other tyrosine
kinase inhibitors like gefitinib have been reported to show
less, rather than more, cytotoxic activity under hypoxia
[38].
Taken together, our data indicate that intrinsic
bevacizumab-resistance is multifactorial and associated
with i) the high levels of VEGF in the tumor environment
that renders the endothelial cells more resistant to
bevacizumab, ii) strong VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 signaling
in the tumor cells that leads to mTORC1 activation as
well as iii) resistance to hypoxia-induced apoptosis. We
further show that all these resistance mechanisms can
be overcome by nintedanib. These findings suggest that

the antitumor activity of at least some small molecule
angiokinase inhibitors is not limited by the mechanisms
underlying natural bevacizumab resistance and provide
a rational for clinical trials of nintedanib in CRC
patients that do not respond to bevacizumab, alone or in
combination with bevacizumab.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Xenograft models.
The antitumor activity of bevacizumab and
nintedanib was evaluated in athymic mice (female
NMRI-Fox 1nu, 6 weeks old) from Taconic (Skensved,
Denmark) bearing DLD-1 or HT-29 CRC xenografts. Two
(HT-29) or five (DLD-1) million cells were injected into
the right flank, and the treatments were started when the
tumors were palpable (median tumor volume ~100 mm3).
The animals were weighted daily and the tumor size
was determined three times per week. Tumor volumes
(mm3) were calculated according to formula: [(length² x
width)/2]. Treated/Control (T/C) values were calculated as
follows: average tumor volume of treated animals/average
tumor volume of control animals x100. Each treatment
group was composed of at least 7 animals. Animals were
treated according to institutional guidelines.

ELISA assay for VEGF.
Healthy tumor tissues were collected from untreated,
frozen tumors (three tumors per xenograft model), and
protein extracts were prepared in RIPA buffer according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. VEGF levels were
determined by Quantikine ELISA (R&D System # DVE00
(human, tumor-derived VEGF) and MMV00 (murine,
stroma-derived VEGF). The values represent the average
of 3 independent experiments, each done in duplicate.

Immunohistochemistry.
Biomarker analysis was carried out with tumors
collected after 28 days of treatment. To measure in vivo
DNA synthesis, the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2’deoxyuridine (EdU, Life Technologies) was administered
48 hrs before sacrifice (500 µg i.p.). The incorporated EdU
was revealed by a fluorescent-azide coupling reaction
(Click-iT # C10337, Life Technologies) of paraffinembedded tumor samples and counterstained by DAPI
to reveal the nuclei of individual cells. The proportion of
apoptotic tumor cells was scored by the TUNEL assay (In
Situ Cell Death Detection kit, Roche Applied Science #
11684795910).
The following antibodies were used for
immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis: anti-CD31 (BD
Bioscience # 550274), anti-HIF-1alpha (BD Bioscience #
610958), anti-HIF-2alpha (Novus Biological NB-100122),
anti-VEGF (Santa Cruz # sc-152), anti-pVEGFR1
(Millipore 07-758) that recognizes phospho-Tyr1213
VEGFR1, anti-pVEGFR2 (Santa Cruz # sc-101819)
that recognizes phospho-Tyr1175 VEGFR2, and antipS6 (Cell Signaling # 2211) that recognizes phosphoSer240/244 S6. The relevant Cy3-conjugated secondary
antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch.
All images were captured by a fluorescence microscope
and the fluorescence intensities were determined by the

Tumor cells, apoptosis and viability assays.
HT-29 cells were kindly provided by Richard
Camalier, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis
tumor repository (NCI, US) whereas DLD-1 cells were
a generous gift from Richard Hamelin (Saint-Antoine
Research Center, Paris, France).
To determine the induction of hypoxia-induced
apoptosis, HT-29 and DLD-1 cells were seeded on
coverslips in DMEM medium with 5% fetal calf serum
under hypoxia (1% O2). Cover slips were removed after
0, 12, 24 and 48 hrs hypoxia and subjected to TUNEL
analysis. Alternatively, hypoxia-induced apoptosis was
determined by the capacity of catalytically active cleaved
caspase-3 to generate fluorescent reaction products
(Caspase 3 fluorescence assay kit, Cayman chemical,
#10009135).
Cellular viability was determined by the MTT
(methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium
bromide)
viability assay as described previously [39] with minor
modifications. Cells were incubated with different
concentrations of nintedanib under normoxia or hypoxia
