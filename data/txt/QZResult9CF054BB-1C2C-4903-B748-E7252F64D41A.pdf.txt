ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer exhibits the poorest prognosis among all tumors and is
characterized by high resistance to the currently available chemotherapeutic agents.
Our previous studies have suggested that stromal components could promote the
chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs). Here, we explored the roles of
pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and the SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis in pancreatic cancer
chemoresitance. Our results showed that primary PSCs typically expressed SDF1α, whereas its receptor CXCR4 was highly expressed in PCCs. PSC-conditioned
medium (PSC-CM) inhibited Gemcitabine (GEM)-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis
in the human PCC line Panc-1, which was antagonized by an SDF-1α neutralizing Ab.
Recombinant human SDF-1α (rhSDF-1α) increased IL-6 expression and secretion in
Panc-1 cells in a time and dose-dependent manner, and this effect was suppressed by
the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. rhSDF-1α protected Panc-1 cells from GEM-induced
apoptosis, and the protective effect was significantly reduced by blocking IL-6 using
a neutralizing antibody. Moreover, rhSDF-1α increased FAK, ERK1/2, AKT and P38
phosphorylation in Panc-1 cells, and either FAK or ERK1/2 inhibition suppressed
SDF-1α-upregulated IL-6 expression. SDF-1α-induced AKT activation was almost
completely blocked by FAK inhibition. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time
that PSCs promote the chemoresistance of PCCs to GEM, and this effect is mediated
by paracrine SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling-induced activation of the intracellular FAK-AKT
and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and a subsequent IL-6 autocrine loop in PCCs. Our
findings indicate that blocking the PSC-PCC interaction by inhibiting SDF-1α/CXCR4
signaling may be a promising therapeutic strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in
pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION

unresectable distant metastases [3]. Therefore traditional
chemotherapy is indispensable in the current treatment
of pancreatic cancer. However, even the most effective
first-line chemotherapeutic agent, gemcitabine (GEM),
can only achieve a slight improvement in survival.
Moreover, numerous clinical studies have shown that
the combination of GEM with other cytotoxic drugs
is unlikely to significantly improve the prognosis of

Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal malignancy
with occult symptoms, rapid development, early
metastasis and high resistance to chemotherapy [1, 2].
At the time of diagnosis, the tumor is confined to the
pancreas in only approximately 10% of patients. The

pancreatic cancer. Therefore, there is an urgent need to
develop novel therapeutic strategies to effectively treat
this devastating carcinoma [4, 5].
Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are a crucial
component in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic
cancer [6]. PSCs remain in a quiescent state in normal
pancreas, however, they can transition to a myofibroblastlike phenotype under various pathological conditions,
including cancer and inflammatory disease. Activated
PSCs are able to proliferate, migrate, and synthesize
various cytokines and extracellular matrix components,
resulting in extensive proliferation of fibrous connective
tissue (desmoplasia), one of the most characteristic
histopathological changes in pancreatic cancer [7-9]. In
recent years, researchers have increasingly recognized
the critical role of the interaction between PSCs and
pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) in pancreatic cancer
pathobiology. Tumor cells secrete extracellular factors to
activate PSCs, and in turn, PSCs release a large number
of cytokines and extracellular matrix proteins, regulating
tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, metastasis,
and drug resistance [8-10]. Our recent studies have also
revealed that PSCs and the stromal microenvironment
play a critical role in pancreatic cancer development and
chemoresistance and indicated that blocking the stromatumor cell interaction may be a promising therapeutic
strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in pancreatic
cancer [11, 12].
Stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), also
named CXCL12 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand
12)), is a member of the CXC chemokine family of proinflammatory mediators. SDF-1 exerts its biological
effect by binding and activating the CXC chemokine
receptor 4 (CXCR4), a G protein-coupled receptor,
which is the predominant receptor for SDF-1 and is
frequently overexpressed in a variety of human cancer
cells. As the predominant isoform of SDF-1, SDF-1α
is expressed in many organs [13, 14]. In recent years, it
has become apparent that the SDF-1α/CXCR4 biological
axis is a critical mediator of tumor–stromal interactions
and is closely related to the malignant process and poor
prognosis in a variety of epithelial cancers, such as
pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer,
and prostate cancer [15-19]. Although preliminary data
have indicated that the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis might induce
chemoresistance in PCCs, its underlying mechanism
remains largely unknown. In addition, it is unclear whether
and how the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis mediates PSC-induced
chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer.
In the present study, we investigated the roles
and mechanisms of PSCs and the SDF-1α/CXCR4
biological axis in GEM chemoresistance in pancreatic
cancer. Our study aimed to further clarify the mechanism
of chemoresistance in a tumor microenvironmentdependent model and identify novel therapeutic targets for
overcoming chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer.

SDF-1α and CXCR4 expression in PSCs and
PCCs
Activated primary PSCs isolated from pancreatic
cancer tissues were verified by immunofluorescence
staining for α-SMA and vimentin (Figure 1a). We
evaluated the mRNA expression level of SDF-1α and
CXCR4 in four PCC lines (MIA PaCa-2, Panc-1, AsPC1, BxPC-3) and four primary PSCs (PSC-S1, PSC-S2,
PSC-S3, PSC-S4) by RT-qPCR. SDF-1α mRNA
expression in the four PSCs was significantly higher than
that in Panc-1, MIA PaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells. Among
the four PSCs, PSC-S1 showed a relatively lower level of
SDF-1α mRNA expression (Figure 1b). In contrast with
SDF-1α, CXCR4 mRNA expression in the four PSCs
was significantly lower than that in Panc-1 and AsPC1 cells (Figure 1c). Because of the expression pattern,
Panc-1 cells (low SDF-1α expression and high CXCR4
expression) were used for the subsequent experiments on
the PSC-PCC interaction.
We also investigated a-SMA, SDF-1α and CXCR4
protein expression in the four resected specimens used for
PSCs isolation by immunohistochemistry (Figure 1d-1f).
Activation of the PSCs in the pancreatic cancer tissues
was confirmed by the expression of a-SMA. In all four
cases, the PCCs demonstrated moderate to strong CXCR4
staining and weak SDF-1α staining, while PSCs in three
cases (PSC-S2, PSC-S3, PSC-S4) showed moderate to
strong SDF-1α staining and negative CXCR4 staining.
However, PSC-S1 was negative for both SDF-1α and
CXCR4 staining. Given the relatively low expression level
of SDF-1α in PSC-S1, we used the other three PSCs to
harvest PSC-CM for further investigation.
We also found that distant samples of normal
pancreas tissue in all cases showed negative staining
for a-SMA, SDF-1α and CXCR4 (except islet cells)
(Figure 1g-1i). To further confirm whether the high SDF1α expression was due to PSCs activation in pancreatic
cancer, we induced activated PSCs to enter a relatively
quiescent state by treating the cells with all-trans retinoic
acid (ATRA). ATRA is an active metabolite of vitamin A.
Our previous studies showed that ATRA could prevent the
activation of PSCs by decreasing cell proliferation, a-SMA
expression and collagen production [12]. After treatment
with ATRA, the PSCs showed morphological changes and
contained fat droplets, similar to quiescent PSCs (data not
shown). We found that the levels of SDF-1α mRNA and
protein in PSCs were significantly decreased after ATRA
treatment (Figure 1j and 1k).

SDF-1α mediated the effects of PSCs on GEMinduced cytotoxicity in Panc-1 cells

demonstrated that the protective effect of PSCs on GEMinduced cytotoxicity was significantly antagonized by
specific inhibition of SDF-1a in a time-dependent manner
(Figure 2b).

To clarify whether PSCs can mediate the
chemoresistance of PCCs, Panc-1 cells were treated with
GEM in the presence of various doses of PSC-CM. The
MTT assay showed that PSC-conditioned medium (PSCCM) inhibited GEM-induced cytotoxicity in Panc-1 cells
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2a and 2b). High
doses of PSC-CM (40% or more) significantly decreased
GEM-induced cytotoxicity in Panc-1 cells (P <0.05). The
Panc-1 cell viability reached a peak when the cells were
co-cultured with 80% PSC-CM, although no significant
difference was found between Panc-1 cells co-cultured
with 80% and 100% PSC-CM.
Subsequently, Panc-1 cells were cultured in serumfree medium containing 80% PSC-CM and then treated
with GEM in the absence or presence of an SDF-1α
neutralizing Ab for 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h. The MTT assay

SDF-1α mediated the effects of PSCs on GEMinduced apoptosis in Panc-1 cells
Apoptosis is considered to be the major mechanism
of GEM-induced cell death [11]. To further explore the
roles of PSCs and SDF-1α in the chemoresistance of Panc1 cells, the effects of PSC-CM and SDF-1α neutralizing
Ab on GEM-induced apoptosis in Panc-1 cells were
assessed by Hoechst staining and Annexin V/PI flow
cytometry analysis.
Hoechst staining indicated that the number of GEMinduced apoptotic Panc-1 cells was significantly decreased
by PSC-CM, which was demonstrated by an decreased
proportion of condensed nuclei (P<0.05) (Figure 3a
and 3b). Moreover, specific inhibition of SDF-1α by a
neutralizing Ab antagonized the protective effect of PSCCM on GEM-induced apoptosis in Panc-1 cells (P<0.05).
Similar results were observed with Annexin V/PI analysis
(Figure 3c and 3d). PSC-CM significantly decreased the
early apoptosis rate induced by GEM from 23% to 8.6%
(P<0.05), which was at least partially blocked by specific
inhibition of SDF-1α (P<0.05). Collectively, these findings
suggested that SDF-1α at least partially mediated the

with a peak value in cells treated with 100 ng/ml rhSDF1α for 72 h.
In recent years, it has been reported that SDF-1α
can also exert its biological effect by binding to another
CXC chemokine receptor, CXCR7. Moreover, gene
regulation via SDF-1α/CXCR4 and SDF-1α/CXCR7 may
be completely different [21]. Therefore, we confirmed
whether the upregulation of IL-6 by SDF-1α in Panc-1
cells was mediated by CXCR4. Our results showed that
the SDF-1α-induced upregulation of IL-6 expression
was significantly suppressed by the CXCR4 antagonist,
AMD3100 (Figure 4e and 4f).

The SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis upregulated IL-6
expression in Panc-1 cells
As a chemotactic factor, SDF-1α has been reported
to stimulate endothelial cells, fibroblasts and tumor cells to
secrete a variety of factors, such as IL-6, IL-8, and matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP). We further explored the effects
of SDF-1α on IL-6 and IL-8 expression in Panc-1 cells.
Panc-1 cells were treated with rhSDF-1α (100 ng/
ml) for 0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and harvested for RT-qPCR.
The mRNA levels of both IL-6 and IL-8 were increased
significantly (P<0.05) (Figure 4a and 4b). However,
compared with IL-8, the IL-6 mRNA level was more
significantly altered and showed a time-dependent pattern
with a peak at 72 h. To further test whether rhSDF-1α
induced IL-6 expression in a dose-dependent manner,
Panc-1 cells were treated with different concentrations of
rhSDF-1α as indicated in Figure 4c and 4d, and the IL-6
expression and secretion levels were detected by RT-qPCR
and ELISA, respectively. Our results revealed that rhSDF1α increased IL-6 expression and secretion in Panc-1 cells
in both a time-dependent and a dose-dependent manner,

The enhancing effects of SDF-1α on GEM
chemoresistance in Panc-1 cells were mediated by
IL-6
Previous studies have shown that the serum
levels of IL-6 were elevated and negatively correlated
with the therapeutic effects of GEM in patients with
pancreatic cancer [22]. As described above, we verified
that SDF-1α mediated the effects of PSC-CM on GEM
chemoresistance, and exogenous SDF-1α led to the
upregulation of IL-6 expression in Panc-1 cells. Therefore,

apoptosis in Panc-1 cells. Our results showed that the
protective effect of rhSDF-1α on GEM-induced apoptosis
was significantly inhibited by the specific inhibition of
IL-6 using a neutralizing antibody (P<0.05) (Figure 5a5d).

and phosphorylation of FAK, AKT, ERK1/2 and P38 in
Panc-1 cells by Western blot. Our results indicated that
the levels of FAK, AKT ERK1/2 and P38 phosphorylation
in Panc-1 cells were all significantly elevated after 30 min
of rhSDF-1α treatment, and the effects lasted for 4 h. The
levels of protein expression were not significantly affected
(Figure 6a).
Both AKT and ERK1/2 are key kinases that act
downstream of FAK. Our previous study demonstrated
that the FAK/AKT signaling pathway is involved in
pancreatic cancer chemoresistance [11]. Therefore, we
further explored whether FAK functioned upstream of the
AKT or ERK1/2 signaling pathways. The effect of SDF-1α

DISCUSSION

on AKT activation in Panc-1 cells was almost completely
blocked by specific inhibition of FAK phosphorylation
using the small molecule inhibitor PF573228. However,
SDF-1α-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in Panc-1 cells
was not affected by FAK inhibition (Figure 6b).
To determine whether SDF-1α-induced FAK/
AKT, ERK1/2 and P38 activation was involved in IL-6
upregulation in Panc-1 cells, small molecule inhibitors of
FAK (PF573228), ERK1/2 (PD98059) and P38 (SB20938)
were used. The effects of these inhibitors on their
corresponding kinase activity were verified by western
blot (Figure 6b-6c). SDF-1α-induced upregulation of IL-6
mRNA and protein expression was partially antagonized
by both FAK/AKT inhibition and ERK1/2 inhibition
(P<0.05) in a time-dependent manner (Figure 6e and 6f),
while specific inhibition of P38 activation did not affect
the upregulation of IL-6 expression induced by SDF-1α.
These results confirmed that SDF-1α upregulates
IL-6 expression through the activation of the FAK-AKT
and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, and not the P38 signaling
pathway, in Panc-1 cells.

A high resistance to chemotherapy and prominent
desmoplastic stroma are two main contributing factors
to the poor outcome of pancreatic cancer. Our group
and others have increasingly recognized the critical role
of tumor stroma in pancreatic cancer chemoresistance
[11, 23, 24]. PSCs are a critical cellular component of
pancreatic cancer stroma. In pancreatic cancer, PSCs
transition from a quiescent phase to an activated phase
in which they proliferate, migrate, and secrete excessive
amounts of soluble factors and extracellular matrix (ECM)
proteins, leading to fibrosis of the pancreas. Activated
PSCs may regulate PCCs growth, survival, metastasis,
and chemoresistance [8, 9, 25]. However, the mechanism
of chemoresistance mediated by PSCs in pancreatic cancer
is not well defined.
SDF-1α and its specific receptor CXCR4 are
highly expressed in a variety of tumors, including gastric,
colorectal, breast, and ovarian cancers [26-29]. Our in vivo
and in vitro results demonstrated that activated primary
PSC from pancreatic cancer tissues typically expressed

high levels of SDF-1α, while high CXCR4 expression
was typically observed in PCCs. Moreover, distant normal
pancreas tissue was negative for both SDF-1α and CXCR4
staining, and PSCs inactivation by ATRA significantly
decreased SDF-1a expression in PSCs. Our results
indicated that the SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis was activated in
PCCs.
Previous studies have shown that PSC-CM could
promote the proliferation, migration, invasion and
organ-specific metastasis of PCCs through the SDF-1α/
CXCR4 axis [30, 31]. Although the effect of the SDF-1α/
CXCR4 axis on chemoresistance to GEM in PCCs has
been reported [32], it remains unclear whether and how
the SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis mediates the effect of PSCs on
GEM chemoresistance. The present study confirmed that

PSCs promoted the chemoresistance of PCCs to GEM,
which was at least partially mediated by paracrine SDF1α signaling. Our findings suggested that blocking the
PSC-PCC interaction by inhibiting the SDF-1α/CXCR4
signaling pathways may be a promising therapeutic
strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in pancreatic
cancer. Compared with previous studies that focused
on PCCs themselves, investigation of the interactions
between PSCs or tumor stroma and tumor cells might
provide more information about the conditions in vivo and
thus be highly useful for studying chemoresistance. In
our previous study, we reported that the ECM component
laminin increased the chemoresistance of PCCs to GEM
[11]. The results provided new insights into the critical
role of the tumor microenvironment in chemoresistance

and offered a reasonable explanation for the frequently
observed discrepancy between in vitro drug sensitivity and
the in vivo clinical response in pancreatic cancer.
SDF-1 has been reported to stimulate different types
of cells to produce a variety of soluble factors, including
IL-6, IL-8, and MMP, upon binding to its specific
receptor CXCR4. Moreover, the effects are cell-type
specific [33-35] . The present study found that the SDF1α/CXCR4 axis upregulated IL-6 in a time- and dosedependent manner in Panc-1 cells. As a multifunctional
growth factor, IL-6 was originally discovered in T cells,
and it can promote B cell maturation. In addition to the
inflammatory response, IL-6 has also been shown to be
associated with various biological behaviors of tumor
cells, including growth, survival, metastasis, angiogenesis,
epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) and
chemoresistance [36-38]. In vitro and in vivo experiments
confirmed that IL-6 could inhibit apoptosis of pancreatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) cell lines and promote
the development of precancerous lesions and pancreatic
cancer, which indicated that IL-6 is involved in early
stages of pancreatic cancer development [39]. Mitsunaga
[22] et al. reported that a high serum IL-6 level was a
poor prognostic factor for overall survival in in patients
with pancreatic cancer. Moreover, high expression of
IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) was confirmed in PCCs and the
activation of IL-6R-related pathway in tumor cells was
associated with a poor outcome in resected pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma [40, 41]. Our previous study also
showed that IL-6 could prevent PCCs migration and the
EMT [12]. All these results suggest that IL-6–mediated
intracellular signaling cascades in tumor cells might play
important roles in pancreatic cancer progression. In the
present study, we revealed for the first time that exogenous
SDF-1α induced intracellular expression and extracellular
secretion of IL-6 in Panc-1 cells, and the protective effects
of SDF-1α on GEM-induced apoptosis in Panc-1 cells
were at least partially mediated by IL-6, indicating that an
IL-6 autocrine loop might contribute to SDF-1α-induced
GEM chemoresistance in PCCs. The IL-6 autocrine
loop in PCCs might be an effective target for blocking
SDF-1α-mediated PSC-PCC interactions. Autocrine
IL-6 signaling has also been found to promote growth,
metastasis and chemoresistance in a variety of tumors,
including breast, ovarian and endometrial cancers [40, 42www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

44]. It has been reported that IL-6 could protect tumors
from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis by regulating the
expression of apoptosis-related genes [32, 45]. Whether
the SDF-1α-induced IL-6 autocrine loop regulates the
expression of apoptosis-related genes in PCCs needs
further investigation.
The SDF-1α/CXCR4 biological axis can activate
multiple intracellular signaling pathways, including the
FAK, AKT, ERK1/2, P38, STAT3, mTOR, and Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathways in various cancers [24, 35, 46,
47]. Our results indicated that the FAK-AKT, ERK1/2 and
P38 signaling pathways were all activated by SDF-1α in
PCCs, and the FAK-AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways
most likely mediated the SDF-1α-induced upregulation
of IL-6 in PCCs. Consistent with the present study, our
previous findings also demonstrated the critical role of
FAK-AKT in the ECM-induced chemoresistance of PCCs,
and the combination of selective FAK inhibitors with
GEM might be a very promising therapeutic strategy for
pancreatic cancer [11]. These results suggested that FAKAKT and ERK1/2 might be critical intracellular signaling
pathways in PCCs through mediation of the tumor-stroma
interaction. The selective inhibition of these signaling
pathways may present a potential therapeutic target for
pancreatic cancer.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that PSCs
contribute to the chemoresistance of PCCs to GEM.
Moreover, we show for the first time that the effects of
PSCs on GEM chemoresistance are mediated through
paracrine SDF-1α/CXCR4 signaling and, subsequently,
the IL-6 autocrine loop in PCCs. Our results also reveal
that SDF-1α-induced IL-6 upregulation in PCCs may
be partially due to its downstream activation of the
intracellular FAK-AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.
Our findings indicate that the interaction between PSCs
and PCCs plays a critical role in pancreatic cancer
chemoresistance, and blocking the PSC-PCC interaction
by inhibiting the SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis and its downstream
signaling pathways may be a promising therapeutic
strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in pancreatic

MATERIALS AND METHODS

vimentin and anti-SDF-1α mouse mAbs, the anti-CXCR4
rabbit polyclonal antibody and the SDF-1α neutralizing
antibody (SDF-1α Ab) were from Abcam. Rabbit mAbs
against pAKT (Ser473), pP38 (Thr180/Tyr182), ERK1/2,
pERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) and pFAK (Tyr397) were from
Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA, USA). The
mouse mAb against FAK, rabbit mAbs against AKT and
and β-actin, the rabbit polyclonal antibody against P38,
and the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were all purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

Cell culture and isolation
Human PCC lines (MIA PaCa-2, Panc-1, AsPC-1,
BxPC-3) were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC). The cell lines were maintained
in culture as an adherent monolayer in RPMI-1640
or Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100
mM each of penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were grown
at 37°C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.
Human PSCs were isolated from four surgically
resected pancreatic cancer tissues as previously reported
(Bachem et al, 1998), and the clinicopathological
data of the four patients are listed in Table 1. Briefly,
tumor tissues were cut into 1-mm3 cubic blocks with a
sterile sharp blade and seeded in 6-well culture plates
with 4 to 6 pieces per well. The explants were kept in
DMEM/F-12 (1:1) culture medium containing 10% FBS
with antibiotics, and the medium was changed every 2
days. After cells grew out from the tissue explants and
reached 90% confluence, the cells were digested with
0.05% trypsin and cultured in DMEM/F-12 with 10% FBS
at 37°C and 5% CO2. PSCs from passages 3 to 7 were
identified by immunofluorescence staining for α-SMA
(Dako, Carpenteria, CA, USA) and vimentin (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA) and used for further study. All
human samples were obtained in accordance with the
policies and practices of the Institutional Review Board of
Peking Union Medical College Hospital.

Evaluation of gene expression by real-time PCR
(RT-qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted from PCC and PSC using
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The
complementary DNA was synthesized using the High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. RT-qPCR was performed as
described by the manufacturer using the Power SYBR
green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The
sequences of the primers used are listed in Table 2. The
transcript level for each specific gene was normalized to
the level of β-actin mRNA and was calculated using the
comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method (2-ΔΔCt).

Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded
tissue
sections
were
deparaffinized, rehydrated, rinsed, immersed in 10
mM sodium citrate, heated for 20 minutes, and cooled
for 20 minutes. The sections were incubated with a
primary antibody against α-SMA (1:50 dilution), SDF1α (1:100 dilution), or CXCR4 (1:100 dilution) at 4°C
overnight followed by incubation with the secondary
antibody. The immunostaining was developed with
3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB). Appropriate positive and
negative controls were run.

Preparation of conditioned medium
Primary PSCs (1x106 cells) were plated in T25
flasks containing FBS-free DMEM/F12 (1:1). After 24 h,
the PSC-conditioned medium (PSC-CM) was harvested,
centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 5 min, and stored at −80°C
until use. For the indirect co-culture with PCC, PSCCM was added to the tumor cells, and the medium was
changed every day for 3 days.

Western blot analysis

Reagents

Cells were processed for protein extraction and
western blotting using standard procedures. Briefly, the
cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and scraped into RIPA lysis buffer containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The cell lysates were
passed through a needle syringe to facilitate the disruption
of the cell membranes and were centrifuged at 14000 rpm
for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were collected.
Proteins (15 – 30 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis on
10-15% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes and subjected to a standard

Gemcitabine (GEM) was purchased from Eli Lilly
(Indianapolis, IN, USA). AMD3100, MTT, Hoechst
33342, PD98059 (an ERK inhibitor), PF573228 (a FAK
inhibitor), SB20938 (a P38 inhibitor) were all supplied
by Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Recombinant
human SDF-1α (rhSDF-1α), the anti-IL-6 mouse
monoclonal antibody (mAb) and the IL-6 ELISA kit were
purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).
The anti-αSMA mouse mAb was from Dako. The antiwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

immunodetection procedure using specific antibodies
against ERK1/2, pERK1/2, AKT, pAKT, FAK, pFAK,
P38, pP38 and β-actin (1:1000 dilution). All secondary
antibodies were used at a 1:5000 dilution. The blots were
processed with the ECL Plus Western Blotting detection
kit (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA), and the
signal was detected using an LAS-3000 image analyzer
(Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan).

PBS, resuspended in 1× binding buffer, and then incubated
with FITC-conjugated annexin V and PI (BD Pharmingen,
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for 15 min at room temperature
in the dark. The samples were analyzed by FACS using
Cell Quest Research Software (BD Pharmingen).

Cell viability assay

Panc-1 cells (1.6x105) were seeded in 6-well plates
and cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h. The cells
were then cultured with fresh medium for 24 h, 48 h or 72
h. The culture supernatants were collected, centrifuged at
1500 r.p.m for 5 min to remove particulate material, and
frozen at −80°C until use. The cell number in each well
was counted. IL-6 was measured using an IL-6 ELISA
Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
IL-6 concentration was normalized to 1x105 cells in each
sample.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

Panc-1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a
density of 4000 cells per well and allowed to settle for 24
h, followed by treatment with GEM (10 μM) under serumfree conditions in the presence or absence of various doses
of PSC-CM (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%) and SDF1α Ab. After 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h of treatment, cell growth
was determined using the MTT cell proliferation assay.
Viability was calculated as percent (%)=(A/B) x100,
where A and B were the absorbance of the experimental
and control groups, respectively.
