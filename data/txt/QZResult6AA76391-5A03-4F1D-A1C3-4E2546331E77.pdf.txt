BACKGROUND: Carcinoids are neuroendocrine (NE) tumors with limited treatment options. Notch activation has
been shown to suppress growth and hormone production in carcinoid cells. METHODS: The purpose of this study
was to provide a process for identifying Notch activating compounds via high-throughput screening (HTS) and to
validate the effects of the strongest hit from the 7264 compounds analyzed: resveratrol (RESV). RESULTS: Treatment
of carcinoid cells with RESV resulted in up-regulation of the Notch signaling pathway as measured by suppression of
its downstream target achaete-scute complex-like 1. Luciferase reporter assays incorporating the centromere-binding
factor 1 binding site also confirmed the functional activity of RESV-induced Notch. Because activation of the Notch
pathway has been shown to suppress carcinoid proliferation, RESV treatment of carcinoid cells led to a dose-dependent inhibition of cellular growth. Immunoblotting revealed phosphorylation of cdc2 (Tyr15) and up-regulation of
p21Cip1/Waf, markers of cell cycle arrest, with RESV treatment. Flow cytometry confirmed the mechanism of RESVinduced growth inhibition is S phase cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, because Notch has been shown to inhibit
bioactive hormone production from NE tumors, RESV also suppressed expression of the NE peptides/hormones chromogranin A and serotonin. RNA interference assays demonstrated that the hormone suppressing capacity of RESV
was due to up-regulation of the Notch2 isoform. CONCLUSIONS: HTS can be used to identify novel Notch activating
compounds, which may have the potential to suppress carcinoid tumor growth and the associated endocrinopathies.

The Notch signaling network is an intercellular signaling pathway involved in cell fate determination, stem cell potential
and lineage commitment.1-3 The Notch genes encode 300kDa multifunctional transmembrane receptors. Binding of one
of the Notch ligands promotes a sequence of proteolytic cleavage events mediated by c-secretase and convertase enzymes
resulting in the activation of Notch intracellular domain.4,5 The active carboxyl-fragment of Notch translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with the DNA-binding protein complex CBF-1/RBPjj, suppressor of hairless and Lag-1, to transactivate target genes that are transcriptional repressors of basic helix-loop-helix factors such as achaete-scute complex
homolog 1 (ASCL1).4-7
The biological function of Notch signaling is cell context-dependent, with the oncogenic role of truncated, active
Notch1 being first identified in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia8 and subsequently being shown to stimulate cell proliferation and prevent apoptosis in breast carcinoma,9,10 melanoma,11 lung adenocarcinoma,12 and kidney epithelial
cells.13,14 Notch signaling may have opposing actions on cellular growth and differentiation, as demonstrated by the tumor suppressing function in epidermal keratinocytes.15,16 Loss-of-function experiments in these cells demonstrate that
the Notch1 homologue and p21WAF1/Cip1, a downstream Notch target in keratinocytes, suppress Wnt ligand expression
and negatively regulate tumorigenesis.17,18
Previous studies have demonstrated conservation of the Notch signaling pathway in gastrointestinal (GI) and pulmonary carcinoid tumors.19 We and others have demonstrated that the downstream target of Notch signaling, ASCL1

transcription factor, can modulate the NE phenotype in
carcinoid tumors.19-22 We hypothesize that regulation of
the Notch pathway by small molecule activators may
exploit a key cellular signaling mechanism regulating NE
cell growth and may represent a novel therapy for patients
with carcinoid disease. In the present study, we sought to
develop a cell-based assay to screen for activators of Notch
signaling using high-throughput screening (HTS) technology. The strongest hit from this screen was resveratrol
(RESV), a dietary polyphenol that has been shown to have
chemopreventive activity against a variety of cancers. Further experiments validate that the effects of RESV on
human carcinoid tumor cells are consistent with Notch
pathway activation and support the concept of using HTS
to identify compounds that may have antiproliferative
and anti-hormone-producing properties in carcinoid cancer cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
Human GI carcinoid tumor cells (BON, provided by
Mark Evers and Courtney Townsend, Galveston, Tex)
and human pulmonary carcinoid cells (NCI-H727,
obtained from American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium/F12 and Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640
medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin.
Luciferase Assay
To measure functional Notch activity, a BON cell line
stably expressing a CBF1/luciferase reporter plasmid was
created. JH23A plasmid (Diane Hayward, Baltimore,
MD) was digested with kpn1/hindIII to remove a
4xCBF1 binding site and was subsequently ligated into
pGL4.20 (Promega, Madison, Wis). BON cells transfected with the CBF1/luciferase plasmid were selected
with puromycin. The resultant clone (BON-CBF1-luc)
was validated via treatment with valproic acid (VPA) or
suberoyl bis-hydroxamic acid (SBHA), and luciferase activity (luminescence) was measured. Luminescence was
assessed using a Monolight 3010 luminometer (San
Diego, CA).
Compound Library Preparation and HTS
A library of 7264 compounds was used to perform HTS.
The KBA01 library consists of 3 commercially available

Cancer

collections totaling 4160 compounds. KBA01 consists of
880 high-purity compounds with known safety and bioavailability profiles in humans from Prestwick Chemicals
(Washington, DC), 2000 diverse FDA-approved drugs
and natural products from Microsource Discovery Systems (Gaylordsville, Conn), and 1280 compounds from
the Library of Pharmacological Active Compounds representing marketed drugs, failed developments, and gold
standards with well-characterized activities. Additional
compounds were obtained from the National Cancer
Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program (NCIDTP), consisting of 1990 molecules selected from
140,000 compounds. The mechanistic diversity set consists of 879 molecules that represent a broad range of
activities in the NCI-60 cell line screen performed at the
NCI-DTP was also screened. The Natural Products
Collection from the NCI-DTP consists of 235 natural
products selected from the open repository of 140,000
compounds. BON-CBF1-luc cells were plated in 384well microtiter dishes using a lFill noncontact reagent
dispenser (Biotek, Winooski, Vt). A total of 0.5 lL library
compounds were added using a Biomek FX liquid handler
(Beckman-Coulter, Brea, Calif). KBA was screened at a
final compound concentration of 1 lM, and the NCI
compounds were screened at a final concentration of
10 lM. Assays were read on a Safire 2 microplate reader
(Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland).
Data Analysis
Percent bioluminescence of the positive control was calculated, and the Z-Factor and Z-prime values were determined for each plate. The Z-Factor and Z-prime averaged
0.63 and 0.77, respectively, indicating that the assay was
robust. Compounds that showed a >150% increase in
signal were used to calculate the Z-factor (n ¼ 112),
whereas VPA showing an average increase of 300% was
used to calculate the Z-prime (n ¼ 16). All data were analyzed in the University of Wisconsin Small Molecule
Screening Facility database, Activitybase (IDBS Inc., Alameda, Calif), which contains more than 50 sets of screening data on the compounds screened in this project, to
rule out nonspecific promiscuous inhibitors.
Cell Proliferation Assay
Carcinoid tumor cell proliferation was measured via 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The cells were then treated with
RESV (Biomol International, Plymouth Meeting, Pa) at
concentrations of 0-125 lM.

Immunoblot Analysis
Denatured cellular extracts (20-40 lg) were resolved by
10%-12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif), transferred onto
nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif),
blocked in milk, and incubated overnight in the appropriate
primary antibody. The antibody dilutions were as follows:
1:1000 for phospho-cdc2 (Tyr15) (Cell Signaling, Beverly,
Mass) and mammalian ASCL1 (BD Pharmingen, San
Diego, CA); 1:2000 for p21Waf1/Cip1, chromogranin A
(CgA), cyclin B1, and CDK2 (Cell Signaling); and 1:10,000
for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
(Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Pierce, Rockford, Ill) were used. Immunstar (BioRad) or SuperSignal West Femto (Pierce) kits were used.
Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry
BON and NCI-H727 cells were treated with or without
RESV for 48 hours. Cellular viability was determined
using trypan blue dye exclusion. For DNA content analysis, cells (1  106) were fixed with cold 70% ethanol,
washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated
with 0.2 mg/mL RNAse-A, and stained with 10 lg/mL
propidium iodide. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and results were analyzed with
ModFitLT3.2 software (Topsham, Me).
Serotonin Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant
Assay
To determine serotonin (5-HT) levels in cellular extracts
of carcinoid cells treated with RESV (0-100 lM), we used
a 5-HT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit
(Concord, Mass). 5-HT values were quantified relative to
the control. Two independent experiments in triplicate
were analyzed.
Notch RNAi Assay
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Notch1 or
Notch2 and nonspecific siRNA (sc-44226, sc-40135, sc40986, and sc-37007; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, Calif) were transfected into BON GI carcinoid cells
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction
Total RNA was isolated using silica-gel membrane-based
spin-column technology (RNeasy Mini-/Micro-Kit, Qia-

1388

gen, Valencia, Calif). Complementary DNA was generated
from 2 lg of total RNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Bio-Rad). Sequences for Notch1-specific primers were
as follows: sense, 50 -GTCAACGCCGTAGATGA
CCT-30 ; antisense, 50 -TTGTTAGCCCCGTTCTT
CAG -30 . Sequences for Notch2-specific primers were:
sense, 50 -TGTGACATAGCAGCCTCCAG-30 ; antisense,
50 -CAGGGGGCACTGACAGTAAT-30 . Sequences for
GAPDH-specific primers were: sense, 50 -ACCTG
CCAAATATGATGAC-30 ; antisense, 50 -ACCTGGTGC
TCAGTGTAG-30 . Reverse transcription was performed in
a thermal controller (MJ Research, Watertown, Mass). The
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reactions (RTPCRs) were performed on a BioRad iCycler, with 3 minutes
95 C, 35 cycles 30 seconds at 95 C, 25 seconds at 60 C
and 30 seconds at 72 C followed by 1 minute at 95 C and
1 minute at 55 C. The results were normalized to GAPDH,
and expression was plotted as the mean  SEM.
Xenograft Studies
NCI-H727 cells (1  106) were suspended in Hanks’ balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and injected subcutaneously into the left flanks of 20 nude athymic NU/NU
mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass),
which were subsequently divided into 2 groups of 10
animals each. Animal protocols were approved by the
University of Wisconsin-Madison Research Animals
Resources Center. Ten days after inoculation, mice were
given 5 mg/kg of RESV (Biomol) in 1 PBS (Invitrogen)
or solvent alone in 1 PBS via intraperitoneal injection
daily for 15 days. The growth rate of subcutaneous tumors
was monitored every 5 days. Tumor size was measured
every 5 days using a 2-dimensional Vernier caliper measuring to the nearest millimeter, and tumor volumes were
calculated using the following validated formula: length
 width2  0.52.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance (SPSS version 10.0; SPSS, Chicago, Ill). P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.

activators of the Notch pathway. Compounds demonstrating bioluminescence on the preliminary HTS screen were confirmed in
duplicate and at 2 separate doses (1 lM and 10 lM). Treatment with RESV resulted in an increase of bioluminescence by more
than 3-fold. VPA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor with documented Notch1-activating potential, served as the positive control.

used to measure relative activity of multiple stable clones
with the Notch-activating compounds VPA and
SBHA.23,24 One of the clones that demonstrated low basal luminescence and high induction activity (BONCBF1-Luc) was used for all subsequent experiments (Fig.
1A). Having established that the BON-CBF1-Luc cells
were sensitive to Notch-activating compounds, we investigated the dose-dependent effects of these same compounds. Both compounds stimulated luciferase activity in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B).
High-Throughput Assay
Pilot screens were performed in duplicate, testing the
entire KBA01 and the NCI Diversity, Challenge, Mechanistic, and Natural Products collections. Compounds that
showed over 150% activation were selected for retesting,
112 in total. Twenty-seven of 7264 tested compounds

produced luminescence 300% of the negative control in
both replicates and were defined as initial hits. Results of
the 2 duplicate screens were in agreement. The 27 compounds were then evaluated in a secondary HTS at 2
concentrations (1 lM and 10 lM) (Fig. 1C). The strongest hit was from RESV. Interestingly, the triacetylated derivative of RESV—triacetyl resveratrol (Figure 1C,
compound C)—exhibited similar luminescence on the
secondary screen.
Confirmation That Resveratrol Induces
Functional Notch Signaling in Carcinoid
Cell Lines
The Notch signaling pathway is a significant regulator of
NE differentiation and hormone production in GI21 and
pulmonary 25,26 carcinoids. It has been previously shown
that Notch signaling is absent in neuroendocrine tumors,

and that Notch overexpression with an inducible Notch
construct causes inhibition of cell growth and hormone
production.19-21,27,28 Based on the results of our HTS
screen for Notch-activating compounds, we wanted to
validate that RESV induced Notch signaling in carcinoid
cells.
To determine whether RESV activated the Notch
signaling pathway, a luciferase reporter assay incorporating the CBF1 binding site was used. RESV treatment of
GI (BON) carcinoid cells resulted in a nearly 3-fold
induction of luciferase activity (Fig. 2A). Notch activation
is dependent upon cleavage of the Notch receptor by csecretase to the active Notch intracellular domain. Importantly, the c-secretase inhibitor DAPT blocked the effect
of RESV on Notch-CBF1 binding, indicating that the
increase in CBF1 luciferase activity was a result of Notch
induction.
To further confirm that Notch-CBF-1 binding
observed with RESV resulted in downstream signaling
pathway alterations associated with Notch activation,
western blot analysis of RESV-treated GI and pulmonary
carcinoid cancer cells was performed. We and others have
shown that Notch activation in carcinoid cells results in
suppression of ASCL1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is regulated transcriptionally by
Notch.20,21 As shown, immunoblot analysis of RESVtreated BON and NCI-H727 carcinoid cancer cells (Fig-

1390

ure 2B) demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in
ASCL1 protein. Exposure of both BON and NCI-H727
cells to 100 lM RESV for 48 hours suppressed ASCL1 to
nearly undetectable levels, consistent with the developmental role of Notch to extinguish ASCL1 expression.
Resveratrol Causes Dose-Dependent
Growth Inhibition in Carcinoid Cancer
Cell Lines In Vitro
Carcinoid cancer cells (BON and NCI-H727) were
treated with 0-125 lM of RESV for up to 6 days and analyzed via MTT assay. Treatment of BON (Fig. 3A) and
NCI-H727 (Fig. 3B) carcinoid cells with RESV resulted
in a dose-dependent and time-dependent inhibition of
cell proliferation. Significant growth inhibition was seen
after 4 days of exposure to 25 lM of RESV in both BON
and NCI-H727 cell lines. After 6 days, growth of BON
and NCI-H727 cells exposed to 50 lM of RESV was
inhibited by more than 50%.
Resveratrol Causes an Increase in Expression
Levels of p21Waf1/Cip1 and Phosphorylated
Cdc2 (Tyr15)
Based on the observed growth inhibition associated with
RESV-treated BON and NCI-H727 cells, we next
assessed the levels of cell cycle regulators associated with
cell cycle arrest. Previously, RESV has been shown to

induce cell cycle arrest in a variety of cancer cell lines by
modulating expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 and phosphorylated cdc2 (Tyr15).29-31 RESV treatment (0-50 lM for 48
hours) induced protein expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 and
CDK2, and cyclin B1 accumulation was observed (Figure
4A). Furthermore, levels of phosphorylated cdc2 (Tyr15)
increased following RESV treatment without any change
in total cdc2 level (Fig. 4), suggesting G1/S phase arrest.
Overall, these results suggest the possible involvement of
cdc2, CDK2, p21Waf1/Cip1, and cyclin B1 in RESVinduced cell cycle arrest in BON and NCI-H727 cells. It
should be noted that immunoblot analysis for cleaved
poly-ADP-ribose polymerase and caspases 3 and 9

revealed minimal to no induction of apoptosis in RESVtreated carcinoid cells (data not shown).
Resveratrol Induces S Phase Cell Cycle
Arrest in Carcinoid Cancer Cell Lines
After establishing that RESV induces expression of specific cell cycle inhibitors, we were interested in examining
the effects of RESV on cell cycle phasic progression. BON
and NCI-H727 cells were treated with either dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) alone or RESV (25, 50, and 100 lM).
After 48 hours of treatment, cells were labeled with propidium iodide and analyzed via DNA flow cytometry. A
representative histogram for the BON cells is shown in

cells. Data are presented as the mean  SEM of triplicate experiments. RESV indicates resveratrol; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase.

Figure 4B, and the data obtained with carcinoid cell lines
are summarized in Figure 4C. In both BON and NCIH727 cells, RESV treatment resulted in a dose-dependent, statistically significant increase in the percentage of
cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, accompanied by a
decrease of cells in the G1 and G2/M phases (Fig. 4B and
4C). There were no prominent sub-G1 apoptotic peaks
detected in either cell line at 48 hours.
Resveratrol Inhibits NeuroendocrineRegulated Secretory Proteins and Hormones
Carcinoid tumors typically contain dense neurosecretory
granules that contain hormones and neuropeptides that
biologically characterize the NE phenotype of carcinoid
disease. CgA is an acidic glycoprotein that is cosecreted
with hormones such as serotonin by carcinoid tumors,
and it is thought to be the precursor to several functional
peptides, including vasostatin32 and pancreastatin.33,34
All NE tumors produce CgA, making this protein a useful

1392

marker for this class of malignancies both in vitro and in
vivo. Activation of the Notch pathway in NE cancer cells
has been shown to inhibit bioactive peptide/hormone
production. We therefore examined whether RESV could
inhibit the expression of CgA in BON and NCI-H727
cells. After 48 hours of treatment of carcinoid cancer cells
with RESV, western blot analysis (Fig. 5A) demonstrated
a significant dose-dependent reduction in CgA expression, indicating a change in the NE phenotype of these tumor cells.
We next sought to evaluate the effect of RESV treatment on 5-HT production in BON cells via ELISA analysis. Previous studies have demonstrated that 5-HT is an
autocrine growth factor for BON cells35 and is implicated
in the pathogenesis of the carcinoid syndrome. As shown
in Figure 5B, treatment of BON cells with increasing
doses of RESV resulted in a progressive reduction of 5HT. The relative 5-HT reductions were 11% at 50 lM
RESV and 59% at 100 lM RESV after 48 hours of

treatment (Fig. 5B). Importantly, this dramatic decrease
in 5-HT concentration was detected in whole cell lysates
of RESV-treated BON cells rather than the supernatant of
RESV-treated cells (data not shown), suggesting that
RESV inhibits the cellular production rather than the
secretion of 5-HT.

Notch2 RNA Interference Selectively
Blocks the Phenotypic Effects of
Resveratrol in Carcinoid Cells
In vitro, RESV affects the initiation, promotion, and
progression of carcinogenesis by modulating signal transduction pathways that regulate cellular differentiation,
growth, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis.36 Besides
Notch signaling, RESV is known to influence important

Cancer

mitochondrial enzymes like complex I37 and the F0F1ATPase,38,39 nuclear factor-jB,40,41 CYP1A1,42 Sirtuin
(Sirt1) enzymes,43 VEGFR,44 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a activity and expression.45,46 Furthermore, we have
shown that RESV activates Notch signaling, but the exact
isoform of Notch associated with the observed effects on
carcinoid cells is unclear. To confirm that the phenotypic
effects of RESV (ie, inhibition of CgA and 5-HT and
down-regulation of ASCL1 protein expression) are a
result of activation of Notch signaling and to determine
the dominant Notch isoform, siRNA targeting Notch1
and Notch2 were used to knock down gene expression.
BON carcinoid cells were transiently transfected with
siRNA against Notch1 or Notch2, nonspecific siRNA, or
vehicle (Lipofectamine) alone, and mRNA and protein
expression were analyzed via quantitative RT-PCR and

immunoblotting, respectively. Notch-specific mRNA
analysis via RT-PCR indicated that Notch1 and Notch2
siRNA transfection resulted in a more than 60% and 80%
decrease in Notch1 and Notch2 mRNA basal expression,
respectively (Fig. 6A). In the absence of siRNA, RESV
treatment led to lower levels of ASCL1 and CgA (Fig. 6B,
lanes 1-2). Similar results were obtained in the presence of
nonspecific siRNA (Fig. 6B, lanes 3-4). Blockade of
RESV-mediated Notch1 induction did not reverse the
RESV-mediated changes in ASCL1 and CgA expression
(Fig. 6B, lanes 5-6). Importantly, the abrogation of
Notch2 induction with siRNA reversed the RESV-mediated changes in ASCL1 and CgA expression. Similar
results were noted with 5-HT production as evaluated by
serotonin ELISA (Fig. 6C). These data suggest that the
phenotypic regulation seen with RESV treatment is medi-

1394

ated primarily by Notch2 signaling, with minimal contribution from Notch1 activation.
Resveratrol Inhibits the Growth of Carcinoid
Tumors In Vivo
After confirming that RESV suppresses carcinoid cell
growth in vitro, we were interested in testing its efficacy in
vivo. After subcutaneous flank injection of 1  106 NCIH727 cells, measurable tumors developed in the injection
site in all mice given transplants (in the middle of the
left posterior quadrant of the abdomen). Visible and
measurable tumors were observed beginning on day 10
after transplantation. Tumors grew as solid masses in the
subcutaneous tissue of the abdominal wall. Histological
examination demonstrated tumor cells exhibiting a monotonous morphology, with delicate intervening

fibrovascular stroma (data not shown). The pulmonary
carcinoid cells contained scant, pink granular cytoplasm
with minimal variation in cell and nuclear size, characteristic of carcinoid cellular morphology (data not shown).
When left untreated, tumors reached a volume of approximately 350 mm3 by day 25 (Fig. 7). Impressively, 15 daily
courses of 5 mg/kg RESV significantly delayed tumor
growth without demonstrating any significant morbidity
or mortality to the mice in the treatment group. In fact,
the growth of the tumors in the treatment group was
almost static, demonstrating a nearly 65% reduction in
tumor volume compared with control mice after 15 days
of treatment. These data provide evidence that systemically administered RESV is able to effectively repress carcinoid tumor growth in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Patients with metastatic carcinoid tumors, rare neuroendocrine (NE) neoplasms characterized by the secretion of
amines and polypeptide hormones such as 5-HT and histamine, often have debilitating symptoms of the carcinoid
syndrome, including diarrhea, bronchospasm, flushing,
and thickening of the right-sided heart valves.47-50 Widespread metastases render conventional surgical treatment
palliative at best; therefore, there exists a great need to develop novel targeted therapeutic strategies both to reduce
tumor burden and to control symptoms of the carcinoid
syndrome.

an essential role in the NE differentiation of cells in the
lung and GI tract.6,51 In the developing fetal lung
epithelium, Ito et al25 demonstrated strong immunohistochemical staining for Notch1, Notch2, Notch3, and the
immediate Notch effector HES-1 in non-NE pulmonary
cells, whereas the mammalian homologue of ASCL1 was
found only in clusters of cells belonging to the pulmonary
NE cells. Thus, the overall effect of Notch activation is to
limit the number of cells that can differentiate into enteroendocrine cells.
In the present study, we identified multiple small
molecule activators of the Notch pathway via HTS and
validated the strongest hit, RESV, in a series of studies.
Treatment of BON GI carcinoid cells and NCI-H727
bronchopulmonary cells with RESV resulted in marked
induction of the Notch signaling pathway, and profound
growth inhibition associated with S-phase cell cycle
arrest. Western blot analysis revealed up-regulation of
p21WAF1/Cip1 and phosphorylated cdc2 (tyr15). Active
Notch signaling led to a dramatic reduction in ASCL1
expression, as well as marked inhibition of CgA and serotonin. Transfection of Notch antisense RNAs into GI carcinoid cells blocked the effects of RESV on Notch
expression, ACSL1 suppression, and the NE markers CgA
and 5-HT. This study is the first to report the results of a
large-scale HTS to identify activators of the Notch signaling pathway and validates the strongest hit from this
screen.
The effects of RESV on other cancer cells have been
extensively described. Broadly, in in vitro models, RESV
inhibited the growth of tumor cell lines derived from various human cancers. This effect has been associated with
the ability of RESV to arrest cell cycle progression, to promote cell differentiation, and to induce programmed cell
death via caspase-independent or caspase-dependent apoptosis or via autophagocytosis. Specifically, in human
colorectal cancer cells, RESV has been shown to induce
cell death through a novel pathway involving lysosomal
cathepsin D.52 Similarly, using microarray gene expression profiling and high-throughput immunoblotting
(PowerBlot) methodologies, Whyte et al53 showed the
arrest of lung cancer cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle
and demonstrated that this growth arrest is mediated by
the transforming growth factor pathway, particularly
through the Smad proteins. Whereas these and other studies intimate that RESV possesses cancer chemopreventive
properties in vivo, several phase 1 pharmacokinetic doseescalation studies and our own data support the

1395

Original Article

hypothesis that RESV is safe and results in minimal
adverse effects on normal cells. In a phase 1 study of oral
RESV (single doses of 0.5, 1, 2.5, or 5 g), Boocock et al54
showed that RESV was well tolerated in a follow-up of
more than 40 healthy volunteers failing to reveal any serious adverse reaction either clinically or via biochemical
and hematologic analyses. Similarly, our mouse xenograft
studies with intraperitoneal injections failed to demonstrate any adverse effects in either the control or RESVtreated mice over the 2-week treatment period.
The mechanism by which RESV regulates ASCL1
expression is a subject of ongoing investigation, because
this dietary polyphenol is known to influence diverse biologic pathways. Several studies have demonstrated that an
early target of RESV is the sirtuin class of nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide-dependent deacetylases.55 It has
been shown that under oxidizing conditions in neuronal
precursor cells, induced Sirt1 and Hes1 form a complex
that binds to and deacetylates histones at the mASH1 promoter, while recruiting corepressors such as TLE1.56 Together, these events cause down-regulation of ASCL1
expression and block neuronal differentation; furthermore, the influence of the redox state on cell-fate decisions
was eliminated through removal of Sirt1 activity by
siRNA or through the use of Sirt1 inhibitors. Interestingly, RESV-induced suppression of ASCL1 in human
carcinoid cells appears to be independent of Sirt1 activity,
because blockade of RESV-mediated Sirt1 induction did
not reverse the RESV-mediated changes in ASCL1 protein expression (data not shown).
RESV-induced regulation of ASCL1 expression,
and subsequently the NE phenotype in human carcinoid
tumor cells, more certainly appears to be regulated by
Notch signaling. In medullary thyroid cancer, an NE
tumor derived from the calcitonin-producing C cells of
the thyroid gland, Notch1-mediated silencing of ASCL1
gene transcription results in decreased expression of CgA
and calcitonin.20 Similarly, stable expression of Notch1 in
BON cells has been shown to result in decreased expression of CgA, 5-HT, SYP, and NSE.19 In the present
study, we clearly demonstrate that RESV induces functional Notch signaling, the first time that this has been
shown in human carcinoid cells. More importantly, it is
the relative contribution of Notch2 rather than Notch1
induction that seems to be responsible for RESV-induced
regulation of ASCL1 protein expression, as demonstrated
by Notch1 and Notch2 siRNA knockdown studies.
Based on these findings, it is suggested that if Notch1 and
Notch2 intracellular domains exert the same downstream

1396

effects; therefore, they may be used interchangeably in scenarios where the goal is to exogenously activate the Notch
signaling pathway for the purpose of controlling cell fate.
Cell-based HTS systems should be used with caution and represent a limitation of this study. The current
cell-based HTS is based on the NCI-60 cell line screen
system, an anticancer drug screen developed in the late
1980s as an in vitro drug discovery tool intended to supplant the use of transplantable animal tumors in anticancer drug screening.57 However, such cell line screen
systems fairly new and should not be used as primary
therapeutic indicators. In cell-based, high-throughput
molecular-targeted screens, compounds can potentially
function in various ways to activate cell-based reporters.
Molecular action in any of several upstream pathways
could result in activity. Therefore, it is essential to identify
the detailed mechanism of action of selected compounds,
which is often a challenging laboratory task. In the present
study, RESV was identified as a potential Notch activator
based on preliminary HTS; furthermore, extensive laboratory testing confirmed that RESV does in fact activate
functional Notch signaling, and that this activation is
responsible for the phenotypic changes seen in vitro.
In conclusion, we report the use of a novel, laboratory-derived, cell-based HTS system for the identification
of Notch-activating compounds. We analyzed 7264 compounds and confirmed that the top HTS hit, RESV, activates the Notch signaling pathway in human carcinoid
cells in vitro. Importantly, this dietary polyphenol induces
functionally active Notch, which represses ASCL1 protein
expression and directly inhibits the NE phenotype characterized by the production of bioactive hormones and peptides such as CgA and 5-HT. Similarly, RESV-induced
Notch activation is associated with S phase cell cycle arrest
in vitro and growth inhibition. Because RESV is a nontoxic, naturally occurring compound with an established
safety profile, it is an attractive target for further in vivo
studies using a murine model of metastatic carcinoid cancer. Based on the data presented here, RESV may additionally be an attractive target for the development of a
limited phase II clinical trial in patients with unresectable
carcinoid disease. Thus, this HTS system could be used to
screen for other modulators of the Notch signaling
pathway.
