Abstract
Adoptive transfer of tumor-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) results in target cell lysis by activating the
intrinsic apoptotic cell death program. Not surprisingly, deregulation of the apoptotic machinery is one of the
central mechanisms by which tumor cells escape immune destruction despite specific CTL recognition. Here
we show that treatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib sensitizes previously resistant tumor cells
for cytolytic T-cell attack. Human T cells were redirected toward melanoma cells by engineered expression of
an immunoreceptor with binding specificity for high molecular weight–melanoma-associated antigen. Established melanoma cell lines as well as primary melanoma cells from tumor biopsies, which are notoriously
resistant toward T-cell lysis, became sensitive upon bortezomib treatment. Detailed analysis of the underlying
molecular mechanism revealed that bortezomib treatment induced mitochondrial accumulation of NOXA,
which potentiated the release of mitochondrial second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC)
in response to CTL effector functions, including caspase-8 and granzyme B. Our data indicate that proteasome
inhibition increases the sensitivity of tumor cells toward cytolytic T-cell attack by NOXA-mediated enhancement of mitochondrial SMAC release. Cancer Res; 70(5); 1825–34. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The aim of immunotherapeutic strategies using adoptive
tumor-specific T-cell transfer is to mount a potent tumor
cell–directed cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) response.
Whereas recent strategies using ex vivo engineered T cells
with redirected specificity showed promising results in some
tumor entities, other tumors proved resistant to CTL attack.
It is crucial, therefore, to understand the tumor cell intrinsic
mechanisms responsible for CTL resistance if T cell–mediated
immunotherapy against cancer is to be successful (1).
Various intrinsic mechanisms contribute to the resistance
of tumor cells toward immune effector cell killing (2). Generally, CTLs execute target cell lysis by activating the apoptotic
machinery (3); however, tumor cells often have impaired apoptotic pathways enabling their survival despite vigorous

CTL attack. CTLs eliminate target cells either by engaging
the death receptor CD95/Fas (4) or by calcium-dependent
exocytosis of granules containing perforin and granzymes
(3). As a result activated caspase-8 (casp-8) or cytoplasmic
granzyme B (grzB) initiates the proteolytic activation of the
effector (executioner) caspases, casp-3 and casp-7 (5) as well
as mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP;
ref. 6). The initial processing of executioner procaspases by
casp-8 or grzB alone is insufficient to induce the level of executioner caspase activity required for target cell killing. To
reach the critical level of executioner caspases, the release of
additional proapoptotic factors such as second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC) from the mitochondria is necessary to displace XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of
apoptosis protein) from partially processed caspases, thus
completing caspase autoactivation (7, 8). Elevated XIAP expression or dysfunctional mitochondrial apoptotic pathways
in tumor cells are likely responsible for the inadequate caspase activation observed during failed CTL attacks (9, 10).
The efficacy of adoptive CTL transfer may therefore be improved by restoring the defective mitochondrial apoptotic
pathways in tumor cells.
A promising tool for breaking apoptosis resistance in tumor cells has recently become available in the form of pharmacologic proteasome inhibitors (11). The proteasome
inhibitor bortezomib has selective antitumor activity and significant efficacy against a variety of malignancies when used
as a single agent. In combination with other agents, bortezomib also sensitizes tumor cells toward chemotherapeutic
drugs (12). Here we explored the effect of bortezomib on

breaking tumor resistance to tumor-specific CTL attack. Human T cells from the peripheral blood were specifically redirected toward defined tumor antigens by expression of a
recombinant receptor molecule (immunoreceptor, chimeric
antigen receptor) composed of an extracellular single-chain
antibody domain targeted at tumor cells and an intracellular
CD28-CD3ζ signaling domain required for T-cell activation
(13, 14). Upon antigen engagement of the engineered T cells,
activation of the immunoreceptor leads to cytokine release,
T-cell proliferation, and ultimately target cell lysis. Although
tumor cells from various entities are effectively killed by redirected T cells, melanoma cells are notoriously resistant to
T cell–driven cytolysis. Using the established melanoma cell
line MeWo as well as primary melanoma cells isolated from
different tumor biopsies, we here show that proteasome inhibition significantly enhances the efficacy of T cell–mediated
killing of melanoma cells. Detailed analysis of the molecular
mechanism shows that mitochondrial accumulation of NOXA
restores the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by potentiating
the release of mitochondrial SMAC in response to CTL effector
mechanisms, which results in enhanced caspase activation
and ultimately increased tumor cell killing. The use of proteasome inhibitors to improve the sensitivity of tumor cells to
adoptive T-cell attack represents a novel concept in the cellular immunotherapy of cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cells, antibodies, and reagents. MeWo [American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) HTB-65] is an established high
molecular weight–melanoma-associated antigen (HMWMAA) expressing melanoma cell line and LS174T (ATCC
CCL 188), a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) expressing colon carcinoma cell line. Both were obtained from ATCC-LGC
Standards GmbH, authenticated, and found to be free of contaminants. Cells were expanded, and a large number of frozen vials were systematically prepared from stocks after 10
passages to ensure consistent starting material for experiments. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% (v/v) FCS, 10 units/mL penicillin, and 200 units/mL
streptomycin (Invitrogen) and regularly subjected to detection of melanoma and colon carcinoma–associated cell markers, including HMW-MAA and CEA. OKT3 antibody was
affinity purified from hybridoma supernatants. The fluorescein (FITC)–conjugated anti-CD3, anti-tyrosinase monoclonal
antibody (mAb) T311, anti-S100, and anti-melanA mAb A103
were purchased from DAKO GmbH, and the phycoerythrin
(PE)–conjugated anti–HMW-MAA antibody EP-1 was from
Miltenyi Biotec. Expression of the respective marker molecules was recorded by flow cytometry using the FACSCanto
cytometer equipped with Diva software (Becton Dickinson).
Primary melanoma cells were isolated from brain (patients
1 and 4) and skin metastases (patients 2 and 3), respectively.
To obtain melanoma cell suspensions, biopsies were disaggregated by incubation with tumor dissociation reagent
(TDE, DCS) for 3 to 4 h at 37°C. Digested tissues were passed
through a 70-μm cell strainer (FALCON), and melanoma cells
were isolated as described previously (15). Isolated cells were

cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS,
10 units/mL penicillin, and 200 units/mL streptomycin. The
study was approved by the local ethics committee in agreement with the Helsinki Declaration.
Immunohistochemistry. Paraffin sections for S100 detection were first deparaffinized by incubation in xylol and ethanol series and washed in TBS. Sections were blocked for 1 h
with 10% (v/v) FCS in TBS before applying the primary antibody rabbit anti-S100 antibody (DAKO) for 16 h at 4°C. After
three 15-min washes bound antibodies were detected with
alkaline phosphatase–labeled antimouse/antirabbit polymer
(DAKO) and neofuchsin as substrate. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin solution for 1 min (Shandon).
Engineering of redirected T cells. The retroviral expression cassette for the CEA-specific immunoreceptor (16) and
HMW-MAA–specific immunoreceptor (17, 18) were previously
described. CD3+ or CD8+ T cells were isolated by magnetic cell
sorting procedures (purity, >98%) using antihuman CD3 and
CD8 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were retrovirally
transduced as previously described (19). Briefly, T cells were
preactivated by incubation with agonistic anti-CD3 (OKT3)
and anti-CD28 (15E8) antibodies (100 ng/mL each) in the presence of interleukin-2 (200 units/mL) for 2 d. GALV pseudotyped retroviral particles were produced by 293T cells
transfected with packaging plasmids and incubated with preactivated T cells for another 2 d. Immunoreceptor expression
was monitored by flow cytometry using an antihuman IgG
antibody, which binds to the common extracellular IgG1
chain of the immunoreceptor.
Specific cytotoxicity of redirected T cells was monitored by
the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfonyl)-5[(phenyl-amino)
carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT)–based colorimetric assay. Briefly, receptor-engineered T cells (104 per well)
were coincubated with 2.5 × 104 tumor cells for 24 h, and
viability of tumor cells was monitored using the Cell Proliferation Kit II (Roche Diagnostics). The reduction of XTT
to formazan by viable tumor cells was monitored colorimetrically. Values were calculated as means of six wells
containing tumor cells by subtracting the mean background level of wells containing RPMI 1640, 10% (v/v)
FCS. Nonspecific formation of formazan due to the presence of effector cells was determined from triplicate wells
containing effector cells in the same number as in the
corresponding experimental wells. The number of viable tumor
cells was calculated as follows: viability (%) = [absorbance (experimental wells − corresponding number of effector cells)] /
[absorbance (tumor cells without effectors-medium)] × 100.
Cytotoxicity (%) was defined as 100 − viability (%).
Sample preparation and immunoblotting. Whole-cell extracts were prepared by cell lysis in CHAPS buffer [10 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% CHAPS, protease complete cocktail] on ice for 20 min. Cytosolic extracts were prepared in buffer A [20 mmol/L PIPES (pH 7.0), 50 mmol/L KCl, 2
mmol/L MgCl2, 5 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L DTT]. Mitochondrial and postnuclear fractions were isolated as previously described (9, 20). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Rabbit
polyclonal antisera specific for human casp-9, BAX, and BID
and mouse anti-XIAP and anti–cytochrome c mAbs were

from Calbiochem (Merck Chemicals), and rabbit polyclonal
antisera specific for human BIM, BIK, BOK, Mcl-1, poly(ADPribose) polymerase and mouse mAb specific for SMAC were
obtained from Cell Signaling. Polyclonal antiserum specific
for PUMA was obtained from Oncogene Research Products.
Mouse anti–complex II was obtained from Invitrogen.
Caspase activation and cytochrome c release. Mitochondria or postnuclear fractions (50 mg protein) were incubated
with increasing amounts of NOXA (the inactivator NOXA BH3
peptide; refs. 21, 22), casp-8, or grzB (Axxora) for 30 min at
30°C. After centrifugation the release of cytochrome c/SMAC
and the casp-3 activity were assessed in supernatants. To initiate caspase activation, 20 μl cytosolic extracts (10 μg protein/
mL) were treated with either casp-8 or grzB with or without the
SMAC NH2 terminal peptide H-AVPIAQK-OH (10 μmol/L; Calbiochem) for 1 h at 30°C. Casp-3 activity was assayed using
100 μmol/L Ac-DEVD-AFC (Axxora) and presented as arbitrary
fluorescence units (FU); 1 FU is equivalent to 0.65 pmol released
7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (9, 23).
Small interfering RNA transfer. Double-stranded small
interfering RNAs (siRNA) of SMAC, NOXA, and control

(scrambled) were obtained from Ambion (Ambion Europe).
Each siRNA (final concentration, 100 nmol/L) was transiently
transfected into 5 × 106 cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The most
efficient NOXA and SMAC downregulating siRNAs were identified by transient transfection of 293HEK or MeWo cells
and Western blot analysis after 72 h (data not shown).
The recombinant lentiviral particles carrying XIAP-specific
and scrambled sequences (pLenti6/V5DEST XIAP-siRNA
and scr-siRNA expressing vectors, respectively) were generated as described before (9, 24) according to the instructions
of the manufacturer (pLenti-Dest Gateway System; Invitrogen). The recombinant lentiviral constructs were transduced
into the MeWo cells, and stable cell lines were generated
using Blasticidine (Invitrogen) selection.

with specificity for HMW-MAA or CEA, respectively, using retroviral gene transfer as previously described (17). The extracellular domain of the immunoreceptors was composed of
the anti–HMW-MAA or anti-CEA scFv for specific target antigen binding and intracellular signaling domain of the CD3ζ
chain for T-cell activation upon antigen engagement. As
shown in Fig. 1A, CD3+ T cells equipped with an anti–HMWMAA immunoreceptor specifically targeted and lysed
the HMW-MAA+ melanoma cell line MeWo. Cytolysis was
antigen-specific, because HMW-MAA− CEA+ LS174T colon
carcinoma cells were not lysed by anti–HMW-MAA immunoreceptor-engineered T cells, although they were targeted
by T cells from the same donor, equipped with anti-CEA immunoreceptor. Conversely, T cells with an anti-CEA immunoreceptor did not lyse CEA− MeWo cells showing the specificity
of the engineered T cells.
Whereas the efficacy of anti–HMW-MAA T cell–mediated
cytolysis of MeWo melanoma cells was poor, requiring large
numbers of effector T cells (effector-to-target cell ratio = 10:1),
cotreatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib significantly enhanced the susceptibility of MeWo cells to redirected HMW-MAA–specific T-cell attack in a dose-dependent
fashion (Fig. 1B). Significantly, improved tumor cell lysis was
not due to direct cytotoxic effects of bortezomib (Fig. 1B), and
alterations in T-cell functions including production and secretion of cytokines under these conditions were not observed
(data not shown). These data suggest that bortezomib treatment increases the susceptibility of melanoma cells toward
cytolytic effect of tumor-specific T cells.
Bortezomib treatment enhances MOMP and caspase
activity in response to recombinant active casp-8 and grzB.
Active casp-8 and cytosolic grzB are the major effector molecules of CTLs that initiate the proteolytic cascade leading
to target cell death. A hallmark of casp-8–mediated and grzBmediated cytolysis is the amplification of proapoptotic signals
involving the release of mitochondrial proapoptotic factors,
including cytochrome c and SMAC. We therefore tested
whether bortezomib treatment facilitates mitochondrial release of the proapoptotic proteins SMAC and cytochrome c
in response to casp-8 or grzB. In a cell-free system using postnuclear fractions comprising the cytosolic and mitochondrial
fractions, recombinant active casp-8 and grzB induced the
release of cytochrome c and SMAC (Fig. 2A). Strikingly, pretreatment of MeWo cells with subtoxic concentrations of
bortezomib (50 nmol/L) significantly enhanced the casp-8–
induced and grzB-induced release of SMAC and cytochrome
c. Correspondingly, in response to casp-8 or grzB treatment
increased casp-3 activity was detected in the postnuclear
fractions of cells pretreated with bortezomib (Fig. 2B). These
data suggest that bortezomib sensitizes melanoma cells to
CTLs by enhancing the proapoptotic response of mitochondria
to cytolytic effector functions, including casp-8 and grzB.
Mitochondrial NOXA accumulation upon proteasome
inhibition enhances mitochondrial perturbation by
casp-8 and grzB. Bortezomib has been shown to induce
the mitochondrial apoptotic process in various tumor
entities, predominantly by altering the expression levels of
Bcl2 protein family members (25). To identify the molecular

targets of bortezomib action, we therefore examined the expression levels of Bcl2 protein family members in MeWo
cells after treatment with increasing concentrations of bortezomib (up to 100 nmol/L). Bortezomib treatment resulted
in the accumulation of Bcl2 member proteins, including
Mcl-1, and BH3-only proteins PUMA, BID, and NOXA (Fig.
3A). Whereas increased expression of Mcl-1, PUMA, and
BID was observed at concentrations associated with direct
bortezomib cytotoxicity and casp-3 activation (100 nmol/L
bortezomib), accumulation of NOXA occurred far below toxic
bortezomib concentrations (between 25 and 50 nmol/L; Fig.
3A). NOXA lacks direct mitochondrial permeabilizing capacity but has been shown to increase MOMP in conjunction
with other BH3-only proteins (26). Accordingly, cell fractionation analyses showed that bortezomib treatment (50 nmol/L)

resulted in the mitochondrial accumulation of NOXA without
inducing the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c or SMAC
(Fig. 3B). Therefore no direct mitochondrial perturbation is
initiated by mitochondrial NOXA accumulation and bortezomib treatment at concentrations of up to 50 nmol/L, in line
with the lack of direct cytotoxicity of bortezomib under these
conditions (Figs. 1 and 3).
To elucidate the effect of NOXA accumulation on casp-8–
induced or grzB-induced mitochondrial perturbation,
postnuclear fractions of MeWo cells were incubated with recombinant NOXA peptide containing the BH3 motif responsible for mitochondrial association and binding to antiapoptotic
Bcl2 members (21, 22). In accordance with the current model
of NOXA action (26), increasing amounts of NOXA alone did
not result in the release of cytochrome c or SMAC from isolated mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. S1). However, casp8 and grzB, in combination with NOXA, significantly increased
SMAC and cytochrome c release in postnuclear fractions of
MeWo cells (Fig. 4A). Similarly, addition of exogenous NOXA enhanced casp-8–induced or grzB-induced casp-3 activity (Fig. 4B).
These data suggest that NOXA is a key mediator of bortezomibmediated mitochondrial susceptibility to casp-8 or grzB

action. Therefore downregulation of NOXA expression in bortezomib-treated MeWo cells should abrogate the effects of
bortezomib. To address this issue, we specifically downregulated NOXA expression using NOXA-specific siRNA. Whereas
bortezomib treatment resulted in mitochondrial accumulation of NOXA both in untransfected MeWo and in MeWo
cells transfected with nonspecific scrambled siRNA, efficient
NOXA knockdown was shown in MeWo cells transfected with
NOXA-specific siRNA. The lack of NOXA accumulation resulted
in significantly reduced mitochondrial release of cytochrome
c, SMAC, and casp-3 activity after grzB or casp-8 treatment,
implicating NOXA as the central mediator of bortezomibmediated sensitization of mitochondria to grzB and casp-8 action.
The central downstream event of NOXA action in enhancing
the susceptibility to redirected CTL attack is to antagonize
XIAP through mitochondrial release of SMAC. The effect
of NOXA on CTL-mediated cytolysis was further examined
by transient knockdown of NOXA in MeWo cells treated with
bortezomib in conjunction with redirected CTLs (Fig. 5A;
Supplementary Fig. S2). Bortezomib treatment enhanced cytolysis of scrambled siRNA–transfected MeWo cells by CD8+
T cells equipped with anti–HMW-MAA, but not CD8+ T cells

was accompanied by increased casp-3 activity as the responsible executioner caspase in CTL-mediated cytolysis. NOXA
downregulation, however, significantly reduced antigen-specific killing of bortezomib-treated MeWo cells by redirected
CTLs. The reduced cytolytic activity of redirected CTLs was
associated with a decline in casp-3 activity.
One of the central mitochondrial functions in response to
CTL-mediated cytolysis is the release of SMAC, which by interacting with XIAP leads to the release of XIAP-mediated
inhibition of casp-3. Accordingly, SMAC knockdown in

(Fig. 5A). Conversely, addition of the SMAC N7 peptide to cytosolic extracts of MeWo cells significantly increased casp-3
activity initiated by casp-8 or grzB (Fig. 5B). To further examine the role of XIAP/SMAC cross-talk, we specifically downregulated XIAP in stable MeWo cell derivatives expressing
XIAP-specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) following lentiviral
gene transfer (Fig. 5C). Casp-8–induced and grzB-induced

downregulated XIAP expression (C2 and C27 cell clones with
80% and 68% XIAP knockdown, respectively; Fig. 5B). Similarly, XIAP knockdown in MeWo cells enhanced their susceptibility to redirected T-cell attack (Fig. 5D), whereas control
MeWo cells expressing scrambled shRNA (MeWo-shRNAscr)
showed no enhanced cell lysis. These data indicate that XIAP
is one of the major downstream targets of NOXA action.
Bortezomib treatment enhances redirected T-cell
response in primary melanoma cells. Primary melanoma
cells from four patients were short-term cultured in vitro,

and the melanoma origin was confirmed by histologic and
flow cytometric analyses for the melanoma-associated markers S-100, tyrosinase, and HMW-MAA (Supplementary Fig. S3;
Fig. 6A). To assess the sensitivity of primary melanoma cells to
specific T-cell attack, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of bortezomib and coincubated with HMW-MAA–
redirected T cells. Although melanoma cells from one patient
(patient 4) were apparently more sensitive to bortezomib treatment resulting in a substantial loss of viability in the presence of
bortezomib alone, treatment with up to 20 nmol/L bortezomib

Figure 6. Bortezomib treatment enhances HMW-MAA–specific T cell–mediated cytolysis of primary melanoma cells. A, fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis of isolated primary melanoma cells was performed using the PE-conjugated anti–HMW-MAA mAb EP-1. Histogram overlays against isotype
control (PE-anti-mouseIgG1; gray). B, XTT-based viability assay of isolated primary melanoma cells (5 × 104 per well) treated with increasing concentrations
of bortezomib alone or together with engineered T cells with anti–HMW-MAA immunoreceptor (effector-target cell ratio, 1:1) for 24 h in triplicates ± SEM.

produced virtually no toxicity in the primary melanoma cells
of three further patients (Fig. 6B). In these patients (patients 1,
2, and 3) bortezomib significantly increased the sensitivity
of primary melanoma cells for T cell–mediated cytolysis in a
dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 6B). Significantly, the potency of
bortezomib to enhance specific T cell–mediated cytolysis
closely correlated with the degree of HMW-MAA expression
by the tumor cells confirming the antigen-dependent effect
of bortezomib on redirected T-cell killing of primary melanoma cells.

Discussion
Here we show that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
sensitizes melanoma cells for redirected, antigen-specific
T-cell attack. Mechanistically, this is based on the mitochondrial accumulation of NOXA, which potentiates the release of mitochondrial SMAC and ultimately results in
enhanced caspase activation executing T cell–mediated cytolysis. Although melanoma cells are notoriously resistant
to cytolytic T-cell attack, they do attract tumor-specific
CTLs, resulting in massive lymphocyte infiltration during
the early stages of the disease. Nevertheless adoptive transfer
of cytolytically potent and tumor-specific tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TIL) resulted only in low therapeutic efficiency

in the treatment of melanoma, whereas TILs in some other
cancer entities proved more efficient (27). A number of mechanisms were proposed to explain the obvious therapeutic
failure of specific T cells. Resistance to apoptosis, a hallmark
of melanoma cells, has been considered as the major underlying mechanism by which melanoma cells escape immune
destruction (2). As a consequence, successful immunotherapy
of melanoma requires a combination of strategies aiming
both at stimulation of specific T cells and restoration of
melanoma cell intrinsic death programs.
In clinical trials proteasome inhibition has been successfully used to counter escape strategies of tumor cells toward
chemotherapy (12). Here we show that proteasome inhibition sensitizes melanoma cells toward tumor-specific
T cell–mediated cytolysis by enhancing mitochondrial apoptotic response. In general, damage signals involving mitochondria are believed to be transduced by BH3-only proteins
that directly bind and block the antiapoptotic Bcl2 members
or activate proapoptotic BAX and BAK. These interactions
ultimately commit the cell to apoptosis by permeabilizing
the outer mitochondrial membrane (28, 29). Mitochondrial
perturbation induced by CTL effector mechanisms, including active casp-8 and grzB, is normally mediated by the
BH3-only protein BID (3). Here we show that NOXA potentiates casp-8–mediated and grzB-mediated CTL action (Figs. 4

Bortezomib Sensitizes Melanoma Cells to CTLs

and 5). The so-called “promiscuous binders BH3-only proteins” BID, BIM, and PUMA can directly bind and activate
BAX and BAK, thus directly inducing cell death (30). NOXA,
however, has been described as a “sensitizer,” which initiates
cell death only in conjunction with other BH3-only members
(28, 30). Indeed, our data show that mitochondrial NOXA accumulation in response to bortezomib (Fig. 3) is not sufficient to induce cytotoxicity (Figs. 1–3). Equally, increasing
concentrations of NOXA peptide alone were not capable of
inducing MOMP in MeWo cells (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S2).
Yet, NOXA accumulation in response to bortezomib or NOXA
peptide significantly enhanced casp-8–induced and grzBinduced mitochondrial perturbation inducing cell death. Because casp-8 and grzB are known to activate BID (by proteolytic
truncation), it seems likely that NOXA sensitizes mitochondria
by enhancing the effects of activated/truncated BID.
As a consequence of mitochondrial perturbation following
CTL attack, SMAC released from the mitochondria is free to
displace XIAP from partially processed executioner caspases
to permit completion of caspase autoactivation, thereby inducing apoptosis (7–9). SMAC peptide or specific knockdown
of XIAP significantly enhanced the cytolytic effect of CTLs in

melanoma tumor cells (Fig. 5), mimicking the effects of bortezomib (Fig. 1). These data indicate that SMAC is a downstream effector molecule of NOXA (Fig. 5). Taken together
our results provide a rationale for the use of bortezomib to
sensitize tumor cells for CTL-mediated attack. Furthermore,
our identification of NOXA and SMAC as the key players in
sensitizing tumor cells toward CTL-mediated killing makes a
strong case for the use of BH3-only (30) and SMAC mimetics
(31) to further improve the cytolytic activity of tumor-specific
CTLs in adoptive cellular immunotherapy.
