Abstract:

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent a unique subset of cells within a tumor that
possess self-renewal capacity and pluripotency, and can drive tumor initiation
and maintenance. First identified in hematological malignancies, CSCs are
now thought to play an important role in a wide variety of solid tumors such as
NSCLC, breast and colorectal cancer. The role of CSCs in driving tumor formation
illustrates the dysregulation of differentiation in tumorigenesis. The Wnt, Notch
and Hedgehog (HH) pathways are developmental pathways that are commonly
activated in many types of cancer. While substantial progress has been made in
developing therapeutics targeting Notch and HH, the Wnt pathway has remained
an elusive therapeutic target. This review will focus on the clinical relevance of
the Wnt pathway in CSCs and tumor cell biology, as well as points of therapeutic
intervention and recent advances in targeting Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

the majority of anti-cancer agents in the clinic. In some
cases, these agents are initially very effective at reducing
or eliminating tumor burden in the patient. However,
tumors often recur, develop resistance and metastasize.
Furthermore, heterogeneity is a hallmark of tumors in the
clinic.
Due to their similarities to normal stem cells, CSCs
are predicted to rely on pathways that govern development,
self-renewal and cell fate. In embryonic stem cells, these
processes are in large part regulated by three signaling
programs: the Wnt, Notch and Hedgehog (HH) pathways
[8-10]. It is an intriguing finding, therefore, that these
pathways are frequently dysregulated in many types of
cancers, and specifically within subpopulations of these
cancers that possess stem-like properties [2, 11-13].
From a drug development perspective, this provides an
opportunity not only for new classes of targeted agents, but
also a novel targeting paradigm: the prospect of targeting
cells responsible for tumor initiation, progression, and
even metastasis. Furthermore, as CSCs often display
an inherent resistance to many standard cytotoxic agents
[14-17], targeting CSCs is also an attractive strategy for
overcoming drug resistance. Agents targeting the Notch
and HH pathways have shown pre-clinical promise, and
are currently being evaluated in clinical trials [18, 19].

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) represent the apex in the
hierarchical model of tumor genesis, heterogeneity and
metastasis [1-4]. Analogous to normal stem cells, CSCs
are thought to possess the capacity for unlimited selfrenewal through symmetric cell division, the ability to
give rise to progeny cells through asymmetric division,
and also an innate resistance to cytotoxic therapeutics
(Figure 1) [5, 6]. While the process of differentiation
initiated by a normal stem cell ultimately results in a
specialized progeny with no proliferative potential,
a CSC gives rise to progeny that do not undergo
terminal differentiation but instead exhibit uncontrolled
proliferation. In the case of solid tumors, this process
drives formation of the bulk tumor mass. This model is
in contrast to the clonal evolution model, which proposes
that tumors arise from a precursor cell with a competitive
growth advantage, most likely due to the accumulation of
mutations that allow unchecked cell division and evasion
of the apoptotic process [7]. The clonal evolution model
would predict that all cells within a given tumor are
phenotypically homogeneous; indeed, cytotoxic agents
that indiscriminately target proliferating cells constitute

While the Wnt pathway has been more challenging to
target, several recent advances have been made with
regard not only to new therapeutic agents, but new targets
within the pathway, as well. This article focuses on the
significance of Wnt signaling in tumor cell and CSC
biology, and strategies for therapeutic intervention within
Wnt pathway.

is the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. However, due to the
similarities in signaling components and crosstalk among
these pathways, it is important to provide a brief review
of the Notch and HH signaling cascades, where progress
has outpaced efforts in the Wnt pathway. These pathways
share overarching themes such as myriad permutations
of ligand/receptor interactions that ultimately impinge
and rely heavily upon a central molecule in the signal
transduction cascade: lessons learned from approaches
successful in targeting Notch and HH pathways may
provide valuable insight in how to approach the Wnt
signaling pathway.

Since the developmental pathways important to
normal stem cells are also important to CSCs, a great
deal of time has gone into developing therapeutic agents
targeting these pathways. The main focus of this review

Notch

to maintain the CSC sub-population, or differentiation to generate the tumor bulk. Conventional chemotherapeutic
approaches target the tumor bulk, but due to their inherent chemoresistance, CSCs remain largely unaffected and potentially lead to tumor
repopulation and/or metastasis. CSC directed therapeutics that target critical regulatory pathways in CSCs, such as Wnt, Notch and HH, have
the potential to inhibit tumor repopulation and metastasis, resulting in tumor degeneration.

an autocrine or paracrine manner, depending on the
context. Receptor engagement results in activation of the
heptatransmembrane Smoothened (Smo), which is held in
an inactive state in the absence of ligand. Smo activation
in turn regulates the activity of transcription factors Gli1,
Gli2 and Gli3. Gli1/2/3 function to regulate transcription
of genes involved in HH signaling such as Gli1 and Ptch1,
and importantly genes involved in epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT), such as SNAIL1 [36, 37].
Dysregulation of nearly every step of the HH
signaling pathway has been linked to cancer progression.
For example, mutations in Ptch1, Smo, Gli1 and Gli3 are
linked to BCC, medullablastoma and pancreatic cancer
[40, 42, 43, 46-48]. Ligand upregulation can also drive
cancer formation, as has been described in breast, ovarian,
pancreatic, prostate and lung cancers [41, 49-52]. Not
only does this list illustrate the relevance of HH signaling
in human cancers, it also provides multiple candidates to
target with novel agents. In fact, several agents targeting
the HH pathway have shown encouraging pre-clinical
results, and are currently in Phase I and Phase II clinical
trials [19, 48, 53, 54]. To date, these trials are evaluating
the effects Smo antagonists developed by multiple
pharmaceutical companies in a broad spectrum of cancers,
such as BCC, multiple myeloma, brain, breast and gastric
cancers. Smo is an attractive target, due to its centrality
in the HH pathway. It will be of interest to see if agents
targeting other components of HH signaling achieve
pre-clinical validation. To this end, efforts are currently
underway to target the Gli transcription factors with
small molecules [55, 56], as well antibody neutralization
of HH ligands to block signaling at the ligand/receptor
interface [57]. While current clinical trials are assessing
HH inhibition in frank disease, the role of HH in CSCs
and EMT suggests that this type of therapy may also be
beneficial in combination with other chemotherapies, such
as traditional cytotoxic agents, to prevent re-initiation of
tumorigenesis and/or metastasis by CSCs.

both embryonic development and in adult tissue renewal
[20]. During embryogenesis, Notch is critical in neuronal
and pancreatic development. In the adult organism,
Notch regulates the fate of hematopoietic stem cells
and gastrointestinal stem cells, as well playing a role
in angiogenesis [21, 22]. Aberrant Notch signaling has
been observed in hematopoietic tumors, such as T-ALL,
and solid tumors, such as non-small cell lung carcinoma
(NCSCL), breast cancer, and various brain cancers
[23-28]. The Notch signaling pathway is comprised of
four membrane-bound receptors (Notch 1-4) and five
membrane-tethered ligands (DLL 1, 3, 4, and Jagged 1, 2)
[20, 29]. A complex signaling cascade is initiated when a
ligand expressed on one cell engages a receptor expressed
on the surface of another cell, and is thus dependent on
cell-cell interactions. Upon ligand/receptor interaction, a
cleavage event removes the Notch/ligand complex from
the membrane-bound portion of Notch. The cytoplasmic
region of Notch then undergoes a proteolytic cleavage
mediated by γ-secretase, releasing an intracellular
domain peptide that translocates to the nucleus and drives
transcription of Notch target genes. These target genes,
including HES family members and myc, regulate diverse
cellular processes such as tissue renewal and proliferation.
The numerous steps required to translate ligand
binding to target gene activation provide a series of
potential points of therapeutic intervention in the Notch
signaling pathway. As a result, there are currently
numerous preclinical therapeutics under evaluation, as
well as several clinical trials involving Notch pathway
inhibitors. Preclinical agents including monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) targeted against Notch and Notch
ligands are meant to disrupt ligand/receptor interaction
events [30, 31]. While this approach has shown promise,
the large number of receptor/ligand permutations may
ultimately result in limited efficacy. γ-secretase inhibitors
act downstream of ligand/receptor interactions and
therefore should not be affected by the diversity of ligands,
receptors, and possible combinations thereof. Several
γ-secretase inhibitors are currently being evaluated in
Phase I and II clinical trials [18, 32-35].

Wnt
Elucidation of the Wnt signaling pathway was built
upon the seminal observation that the Drosophila segment
polarity gene Wingless had a common origin with the
murine oncogene Int-1 [58]. This discovery launched an
intense field of study that has resulted in the identification
of 19 mammalian Wnts, myriad Wnt receptors, and
characterization of pathways involved in biological
processes involved in embryogenesis, development, cell
polarization, differentiation and proliferation [59-62].
Wnts are secreted glycoproteins which bind to cell
surface receptors to initiate signaling cascades important
in many physiological settings, as described above [63].
Wnt signaling cascades are highly conserved among
species, and have traditionally fallen into two categories:
canonical and non-canonical, differentiated by their

HedgeHog
Under normal conditions, HH signaling plays
important roles in embryonic development and is
also involved in tissue regeneration in adults [36, 37].
Activating events in the HH pathway are involved in
numerous human cancers, including pancreatic cancer,
various leukemias, and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) [3845]. Like Notch signaling, HH signaling is comprised
of multiple ligands that can regulate receptor activity
[36, 37]. Mammalian HH signaling is initiated when
one of three HH ligands- Sonic, Indian, and Desert
HH- bind the dodecatransmembrane receptor Patched
(Ptch1). Ligand/receptor interactions occur through

common feature across a broad spectrum of human cancers
(Figure 2). However, as β-catenin is an intracellular
signaling protein with no discernable enzymatic activities,
it has been considered to be “undruggable”. Due to
intense research efforts in this field, recent findings have
provided hope that we may be able to target other aspects
of this pathway to inhibit aberrant β-catenin activation/
transcriptional activity.
In the absence of Wnt stimulus, β-catenin is held in
an inactive state by a multimeric “destruction” complex
comprised of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), Axin,
glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and casein kinase
1α (CK1α) [76]. APC and Axin function as a scaffold,
permitting GSK3β- and CK1α-mediated phosphorylation
of critical residues within β-catenin. These phosphorylation
events mark β-catenin for ubiquitination and subsequent
proteasomal degradation [77, 78].
An additional layer of regulation that keeps β-catenin
levels low in cells is the expression and secretion of
antagonists of the Wnt pathway. These come in two

dependence on β-catenin. Non-canonical Wnt pathways,
such as the planar cell polarity (PCP) and Ca2+ pathway,
regulate processes such as cell dorsoventral patterning
and neuronal migration, function through β-catenin
independent mechanisms, and remain better characterized
in lower organisms [64-66]. Canonical Wnt signaling
is initiated when a Wnt ligand engages co-receptors of
the Frizzled (Fzd) and low-density lipoprotein receptorrelated protein (LRP) families, ultimately leading
to β-catenin stabilization, nuclear translocation and
activation of target genes [67-72]. This canonical pathway
is far better characterized in mammalian systems, and will
be the focus of this review. We will highlight paradigms
and discovery efforts that highlight the promise, and
challenges, of targeting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway; for
a more exhaustive review of discovery, pre-clinical and
clinical candidates, we recommend several excellent
review articles found among the references [11, 73-75].
It has been appreciated for decades that dysregulation
of the mechanisms that regulate β-catenin signaling is a

cancers, captured in the white boxes. Upon entering the nucleus and interacting with TCF/LEF and various co-activators, β-catenin drives

Cancer Stem Cells

flavors, proteins that bind Wnt ligands, and proteins
that bind Wnt receptors [79]. Members of the secreted
Frizzled-related protein (sFRP) family, as well as Wnt
Inhibitory Factor-1 (WIF-1) and Cerberus function in a
manner analogous to decoy receptors by binding Wnts
and preventing their interaction with Fzd/LRP [80-85]. A
second family of secreted Wnt antagonists is the Dickkopf
(Dkk) family [86]. Dkk proteins bind to LRP5/6, thus
preventing formation of the Wnt-Fzd-LRP5/6 ternary
complex required to initiate canonical Wnt signaling [8789].
Canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is initiated
when a Wnt ligand engages its co-receptors, Fzd and
LRP5/6, forming a ternary complex on the extracellular
membrane. Fzd, made up of 10 family members, is a
seven transmembrane receptor that binds Wnts through an
extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) [90]. LRP5/6
is a transmembrane receptor with a large extracellular
domain critical for Wnt binding, and a short intracellular
tail that plays an important role in initiating the Wntmediated signaling cascade [91-93]. These receptors will
be described in greater detail below, as they play critical
roles in initiating Wnt signaling and are thus attractive
points for therapeutic intervention.
Wnt binding to Fzd-LRP5/6 initiates a cascade
of events that results in disruption of the β-catenin
destruction complex, leading to β-catenin stabilization
and nuclear translocation. The early events initiated by
Wnt-Dvl-LRP binding remain incompletely understood.
However, current data demonstrate that Wnt binding
results in phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of
LRP5/6 within a PPSP domain in its C-terminus [87].
This phosphorylation involves GSK3β and casein kinase
1-gamma (CK1γ), though it is unknown if other kinases
or phosphatases regulate LRP5/6 phosphorylation.
Following phosphorylation, Axin and GSK3β are
recruited to LRP5/6, thereby driving dissociation of the
destruction complex. Concurrent with Axin recruitment
is recruitment and phosphorylation-mediated activation
of the Dishevelled (Dvl) family of proteins. CK1 family
members play a role in Dvl activation [94], and Dvl has
also been implicated in the phosphorylation of LRP5/6
[95, 96]. While the precise series of events remains to
be clarified, it is generally accepted that Wnt binding
to Fzd and LRP5/6 results in recruitment of Axin,
GSK3β and Dvl to the co-receptor complex, leading to
disruption of the β-catenin destruction complex, β-catenin
stabilization and nuclear translocation. Once in the
nucleus, β-catenin forms a complex with members of the
T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) family
of transcription factors, recruiting co-factors such as CBP,
p300, TNIK, Bcl9 and Pygopus, and ultimately driving
transcription of target genes including c-myc, cyclin D,
and survivin [95-97].

The relevance of Wnt signaling in human cancers is
highlighted by the frequency with which this pathway is
aberrantly activated across a vast range of malignancies.
The first described, and perhaps best well known role
for Wnt/β-catenin signaling is in colon cancer, where
nearly 90% of these tumors harbor mutations that result
in β-catenin mutation [98-100]. The most common type
of mutation in colon cancer results in the inactivation of
APC, thus driving constitutive activation of β-catenin.
Activating mutations within β-catenin itself are also found
in this disease, albeit at a much lower frequency [101,
102]. It is important to note that while there are numerous
mechanisms that drive aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling,
these different mechanisms nearly always occur in a
mutually exclusive manner. It is very rare, for example,
to find a colorectal tumor with mutations in both APC and
β-catenin.
Interestingly, a growing body of evidence illustrates a
critical role of β-catenin in CSCs [103-105]. For example,
stem-like colon cells with a high level of β-catenin
signaling have a much greater tumorigenic potential than
counterpart cells with low β-catenin signaling [106].
Furthermore, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function
is regulated by Wnt activity [107-109]. HSCs and the
niche microenvironments in which they reside secrete
Wnts, again illustrating a possible autocrine or paracrine
Wnt model [108]. Axin expression in HSCs leads to
growth inhibition and diminished reconstitution, and HSC
function and lymphocyte development have been shown
to be dependent on Wnt signaling [109].

Strategies for Targeting the
Wnt Pathway
The brief overview of canonical Wnt signaling
described above provides a glimpse into the complexity
of this system. However, the array of numerous ligands,
receptors, kinases, signal transducers and transcription
factor complexes also provide an opportunity for multiple
modes of therapeutic targeting and intervention. We
will therefore discuss three major areas of targeting
the Wnt pathway which have shown promise in recent
years: receptor/ligand interactions, cytosolic signaling
components, and nuclear signaling components.

Receptor/ligand interactions
Mutations downstream of Wnt receptors, such as
those found in APC or β-catenin, were the first examples of
aberrant Wnt signaling in human cancers. Some cancers,
however, demonstrate hallmarks of constitutive Wnt
signaling in the absence of downstream mutations. Triple

negative breast cancers and non-small cell lung cancers
(NSCLCs) have been demonstrated to harbor high levels
of uncomplexed cytosolic β-catenin and exhibit a high
basal level of Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional activation
[110, 111]. This suggests an autocrine mechanism of
Wnt activation in certain tumors. Indeed, epigenetic
silencing of endogenous Wnt inhibitors such as sFRP
has been observed in many types of cancers [112, 113].
Furthermore, certain tumor cell lines have been shown
to express high levels of particular Wnts, and treatment
of these cells with Wnt inhibitors such as Dkk or sFRP
has an anti-proliferative effect [110, 111]. In line with
these findings are other observations and opportunities
that validate the approach of targeting Wnt signaling at
the extracellular level.
Given the sheer number of Wnt growth factors, and
functional redundancy demonstrated by knock-out mouse
models, it is tempting to speculate that antibodies directed
against any particular Wnt may not be a viable approach
for inhibiting the Wnt pathway. However, a series of
studies by the Jablons group has demonstrated that certain
tumor models rely heavily on specific Wnts. Monoclonal
antibodies against Wnt1 and Wnt2 drive apoptosis in a
variety of tumor models, including melanoma, NSCLC,
mesothelioma, sarcoma, breast and CRC cells [97,
114-118]. However, these antibodies only had modest
efficacy in xenograft models derived from some of these
cells [115, 118]. This could potentially be explained by
differences in Wnt expression profiles in mice relative to
a specific tissue culture line. Murine and human Wnts, as
well as their receptors, share a high degree of homology,
and have been demonstrated to function interchangeably.
Nevertheless, these in vitro results are encouraging, and
warrant further exploration into the development of
specific Wnt antibodies.

While tumors which rely exclusively on a specific
Wnt may be amenable to monoclonal antibody targeting,
tumors that are driven by multiple Wnt ligands would not
be effectively targeted in this manner. In this scenario, a
pan-Wnt inhibitor may prove to be more efficacious. A
recent study from Genentech demonstrated that a soluble
ligand binding domain of Fzd8, Fzd8-CRD-Fc, inhibited
autocrine Wnt signaling in vitro, as well as in multiple
xenograft models [119]. Mice treated with this soluble
receptor displayed no signs toxicity after several weeks of
treatment, demonstrating that pan-Wnt inhibition may be
a safe and efficacious approach for targeting appropriate
tumor types.
An alternative approach to inhibiting ligand/receptor
interactions would be to target the Wnt co-receptors,
LRP5/6 and members of the Fzd family. The LRP family
of co-receptors is comprised of 2 highly homologous
members, LRP5 and LRP6. These are long single-pass
transmembrane receptors, and endogenous Wnt inhibitors
of the Dkk family bind LRP5/6 to block Wnt signaling [86,
120]. Thus, a plausible approach to Wnt inhibition may
be through antibody targeting of LRP5/6. Furthermore, a
recent study by Bourhis et al. described specific domains
with the propeller regions of LRP6 that may preferentially
bind specific Wnt ligands [121]. These propeller domains
may offer an added degree of specificity for antibodymediated Wnt inhibition.
The Fzds are family of seven transmembrane
receptors comprised of 10 members.
Fzd family
members share a high degree of homology in their
extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD), which is the
region responsible for Wnt-Fzd interactions [90]. While
not thought to function in as classical G-protein coupled
receptors, the transmembrane regions of Fzds may still
serve as potential small molecule binding pockets, raising

An antibody that recognizes the conserved CRD regions
across multiple Fzds may also prove to be an attractive
therapeutic strategy for blocking Wnt signaling at the
receptor level.

of hyperactive Wnt signaling provide a therapeutic benefit.
With the exception of LRP5/6, it will be important to keep
in mind that many of these kinases play important roles
in signaling programs distinct from the Wnt pathway, and
will therefore need to be approached in a highly contextdependent manner.
A critical component of the β-catenin destruction
complex is the scaffolding protein Axin.
Axin
overexpression can inhibit Wnt signaling, and Axin
undergoes genetic inactivation in various cancers
[126-128]. This suggests that positive regulation of
Axin activity may have a negative impact on Wnt
signaling. Interestingly, a recent study utilizing a high
throughput screen to identify inhibitors of Wnt-mediated
transcriptional activity identified XAV939, a small
molecule that increased levels of Axin1 and Axin2, thus
inhibiting β-catenin stabilization, accumulation and
transcriptional activity [129]. The authors then went on
to show that XAV939 inhibited the activity of Tankyrase 1
and Tankyrase 2, members of the PARP family that mark
Axin for degradation [130]. In a similar set of studies,
Chen et al. independently identified IWR-1, a small
molecule that increased Axin stabilization [131]. Both
compounds inhibited Wnt signaling and tailfin generation
in zebrafish, a classical Wnt/β-catenin driven model.
IWR-1 inhibited β-catenin activity in DLD-1 cells, a
human CRC cell line that harbors an inactivating mutation
in APC, and XAV939 inhibited growth in the same setting.
These data offer encouragement that in the appropriate
setting, Axin stabilization may provide a novel strategy
to inhibit β-catenin signaling. However, the effect of
these compounds in the setting of an activating mutation
in β-catenin remains to determined. Furthermore, the
effects of systemic Axin stabilization and Tankyrase
inhibition have not yet been investigated. Compounds
such as XAV939 and IWR-1 will surely help us gain a
greater understanding these aspects of Tankyrase and
Axin biology, and may guide efforts of identifying cancer
types susceptible to this mechanism of action.
Ultimately, these myriad upstream signaling events
impinge upon β-catenin, leading to its stabilization,
accumulation and nuclear translocation. Despite intense
research efforts, progress has been slow in directly and
selectively targeting β-catenin. Theriac Pharmaceutical
Corporation recently described a small molecule inhibitor
of the Wnt pathway which is proposed to function via
inducing β-catenin destabilization [73]. CWP232291
was identified in a high throughput screen for inhibitors
of Wnt/β-catenin mediated transcriptional activity. in
vitro, CWP232291 demonstrated anti-proliferative
effects in various cell lines, and inhibited transcription
of β-catenin target genes. In an in vivo AML model,
CWP232291 inhibited tumor progression and exhibited
a favorable safety profile, and is currently scheduled for
Phase I clinical trials in AML and multiple myeloma
in 2010. While its mechanism of action remains to be

Cytosolic signaling components
Biologics approaches interfering with Wnt/coreceptor interactions have shown promise, as illustrated
above. The intracellular signaling components of the
Wnt pathway also provide myriad targets for therapeutic
intervention, and are ripe for targeting with either small
molecules or perhaps protein mimetics designed to impact
critical steps along the Wnt signaling cascade.
Constitutive β-catenin signaling, due to inactivating
mutations in APC or activating mutations within β-catenin
itself, plays a critical role in the development of certain
cancers. Colorectal cancer is the best example, as nearly
90% of all CRCs harbor mutations driving β-catenin
signaling. These mutations lead to the stabilization and
accumulation of β-catenin and subsequent translocation
into the nucleus. Preventing β-catenin stabilization and
accumulation are of obvious interest, though this has
proven to be an extremely difficult task, perhaps because
β-catenin does not possess enzymatic activity. However, a
greater understanding of the β-catenin destruction complex
and the auxiliary proteins involved in its regulation
provide new possibilities for therapeutic intervention to
regulate this step of the Wnt signaling pathway.
The most upstream intracellular components of
the Wnt pathway are at the receptor level. LRP5/6
phosphorylation plays a critical role in initiating the
Wnt signaling cascade [122]. While the series of events
leading to this phosphorylation are not yet entirely clear,
this is an area of intense research and will most likely
yield new clues, and thus targets, regarding intracellular
LRP5/6 phosphorylation. Similarly, while Dvl family
proteins play a critical role in disruption of the β-catenin
destruction complex, the precise mechanism of their
regulation remains to be elucidated. Several compounds
were recently described that target the PDZ domain of Dvl
and subsequently interfere with Wnt/β-catenin signaling
[123, 124]. CK1 family members play a positive role in
phosphorylation and activation of Dvl, phosphorylation
of LRP5/6 and phosphorylation of β-catenin [87, 94,
125], and may therefore provide an opportunity for
intervention. However, different isoforms within the
CK1 family play opposing roles in regulating Wnt
signaling: CK1δ contributes to LRP phosphorylation and
CK1ε phosphorylates Dvl, while CK1α phosphorylates
β-catenin, thus playing a negative regulatory role in the
pathway. A CK1 modulator must therefore demonstrate
the appropriate selectivity. Similarly, GSK3β also
plays a critical role within the destruction complex, and
molecules which potentiate GSK3β activity in the setting

especially with regard to the role of the Wnt pathway
in CSCs [75, 145-147]. A screen of compounds that
could inhibit β-catenin/TCF-dependent transactivation
identified ICG-001, which also down-regulated β-catenin
target genes and inhibited growth in a CRC xenograft
model [146]. ICG-001 was shown to disrupt selectively
the interaction between β-catenin/TCF and CBP, but not
p300. While these data are encouraging, it is important to
note that ICG-001 targets CBP, a promiscuous co-factor
involved in numerous signaling pathways. Furthermore,
as the effective dose of ICG-001 is near 10μM, it will be
critical to develop derivatives with improved specificity
in order to rule out off-target effects. These studies offer
hope that targeting distinct β-catenin/TCF co-factor
interactions may provide an opportunity to target specific
sub-populations of Wnt-dependent cells.
Leproucelet and colleagues utilized a high
throughput screen to identify a series of small molecules
that disrupted β-catenin/TCF interaction [148]. These
compounds inhibited β-catenin/TCF transactivation
activity and target gene activity in HCT116 CRC cells,
and inhibited duplication of the Xenopus embryonic
dorsal axis. The mechanism(s) by which these compounds
disrupt β-catenin/TCF interaction remain to be elucidated,
but provide a proof of concept that interference of this
protein-protein interaction can be achieved with promising
effects.
An expanded base of knowledge regarding critical
β-catenin/TCF co-regulators will be critical in the
development of novel antagonists of the Wnt signaling
pathway. For example, recent reports from the Clevers
and Yamada groups have identified Traf2- and NckInteracting Kinase (TNIK) as a critical mediator of Wntdriven transcription in CRC [149, 150]. In the mouse
small intestinal crypt, TNIK interacts with the β-catenin/
TCF complex exclusively in the proliferative crypt,
as opposed to the differentiated villus, in a β-catenin
dependent manner. TNIK phosphorylates TCF4, and a
kinase-dead mutant of TNIK abrogated β-catenin/TCFdriven transactivation. siRNA-mediated inhibition of
TNIK had an anti-proliferative effect in vitro, and inhibited
tumor growth in an HCT116 xenograft model. It will be
of interest to determine if inhibitors of this component of
the β-catenin/TCF transcriptional complex, as well as the
others listed above, serve as novel targets of inhibition in
the Wnt signaling pathway.

elucidated, this compound was reported to be active in the
context of both wild-type and mutant β-catenin, raising
the possibility of anti-tumor effects across a broad range
of cancers.
Several agents with diverse, or even unknown,
mechanisms of action have shown activity in Wnt/βcatenin driven cancers and cancer cell lines. Aspirin and
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have
recently shown promise in clinical trials at preventing
polyp formation in colon cancer patients without
mutations in APC, and regular use of these agents has been
correlated with a decreased occurrence of cancers such as
breast and lung cancer [132-134]. While these are nonspecific agents that regulate numerous cellular processes,
cell culture experiments have demonstrated that various
NSAIDs can inhibit β-catenin nuclear localization and
Wnt/β-catenin mediated gene transcription [135]. Other
compounds, such as the polyphenols curcumin and ECGC,
also inhibit Wnt/β-catenin activity in cellular assays,
though their mechanism(s) of action remain undefined
[136, 137].
An additional component of Wnt signaling,
especially important in those tumors in which paracrine/
autocrine Wnt signaling drives activation of the pathway,
is the processing and secretion of the Wnt ligands. In the
same study mentioned above that led to the discovery
of the Axin destabilizer IWR-1, IWP-1 and IWP-2 were
shown to inhibit Wnt-driven transactivation activity with
similar potency, though through a distinct mechanism
[131]. IWPs were shown to down-regulate Wnt secretion
by inhibiting the activity of the acyltransferase Porcupine
(Porcn). Porcn belongs to the family of membrane-bound
O-acyltransferases (MBOATs), which facilitate protein
secretion via palmitoylation [138-141]. IWPs inhibited
the secretion of Wnts, but not other MBOAT substrates,
indicating a degree of Wnt specificity. While its precise
mechanism of Porcn inhibition is unclear, this paradigm
demonstrates another layer of Wnt signaling that may be
amenable to pharmacological inhibition.

Nuclear signaling components
Upon entering the nucleus, β-catenin interacts with
members of the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors to
drive target gene expression. In the absence of β-catenin,
TCF/LEF is held in a transcriptionally inactive state
through interactions with co-repressors such as Groucho
and HDACs [142]. β-catenin interaction with TCF/LEF
displaces these co-repressors and recruits a variety of
co-activators, such as CBP, p300, BCL9, Pygopus, and
Brg1 [142-144]. These co-activators play critical roles
in driving β-catenin-mediated transcription, and therefore
represent potential therapeutic targets.
A compelling series of studies by the Kahn group
has suggested differential roles for the highly homologous
CBP and p300 in Wnt/β-catenin-driven signaling,

Moving Forward: Targeting Wnt
in Cancer and Cancer Stem Cells
As a result of its role in numerous cancers, the
Wnt signaling pathway is a prime target for therapeutic
intervention. Inhibition of Wnt signaling has proven
to be an elusive goal over the years. However, as new
developments emerge in the field of Wnt biology, the
field continues to inch closer to an effective strategy of

development, Wnt signaling plays a critical role in EMT
required for heart cushion development, and aberrant
Wnt signaling also drives EMT and tumor formation in
mouse xenograft models [162-165]. Cells undergoing
EMT possess important properties normally found in stem
cells, including the acquisition of the CD44+CD24low cellsurface marker pattern and the ability to form spheroids
in suspension culture- key properties of normal and
cancer stem cells [165, 166]. It is therefore reasonable
to hypothesize that the Wnt pathway may offer a unique
opportunity to target metastasis, which is the leading
cause of morbidity in many types of cancers.

Wnt inhibition. Concurrent with these advances comes
the realization that Wnt signaling plays critical roles in
biology of CSCs.
A role for Wnt signaling has been demonstrated in
a variety of CSC settings, including colon, breast and
cutaneous CSCs, as well as in hematopoietic stem cells
[104-106, 151-153]. CSCs are also thought to play a
role in drug resistance and metastasis [16, 154-158].
The approaches described above for targeting various
components of the Wnt signaling pathway may potentially
also be used to target CSCs. For example, colon cancer
stem cells have been described to harbor high levels of
β-catenin transcriptional activity, and this is correlated
with their tumorigenic potential [106]. Wnt stimulation
may occur in an autocrine fashion due to colon CSC
Wnt secretion, and may be potentiated by secreted
factors from cells within the CSC microenvironment. It
is therefore plausible to imagine a therapeutic strategy
involving several of the potential agents listed above: a
Wnt neutralizing approach or Wnt secretion inhibitor may
dampen initiation of the Wnt signaling cascade, while a
β-catenin destabilizer or β-catenin/TCF disruptor could
provide downstream inhibition. Wnt inhibition could also
be used in combination with classic chemotherapeutic
agents. A cytotoxic agent such as cisplatin may target
the bulk of a tumor but not the inherently chemoresistant
CSCs, which might ultimately give rise to chemorefractory
tumor cells. However, if the CSCs were targeted in parallel
with a Wnt pathway inhibitor, a curative response might
be achieved. These situations are clearly speculative, but
are meant to highlight the enormous potential of targeting
developmental pathways in cancer and CSCs, such as the
Wnt signaling pathway.
Another potential advantage of employing a Wnttargeted therapy is the potential role for CSCs in resistance
to classical cytotoxic treatments (i.e. chemotherapy and
ionizing radiation) and in metastatic disease. CSCs in
a broad range of cancers are relatively more resistant to
these conventional therapeutic approaches than their bulk
tumor cell counterparts, as has been described in CSCs in
leukemias and breast, colorectal, and brain cancers [16,
17, 159, 160]. A role for autocrine Wnt signaling has been
described in various breast cancer cell lines: certain triplenegative breast cancer lines have been shown to express
Wnt ligands, and harbor hallmarks of aberrant Wnt/βcatenin signaling in the absence of common mutations
in the pathway [111]. Wnt signaling in these cells is
inhibited by overexpression of endogenous inhibitors
such as Dkk1, thus validating an autocrine Wnt loop
that is amenable to pharmacologic inhibition. In breast
cancer patients, a recent study has also demonstrated the
presence of CD44+CD24low stem-like cells in metastases,
suggesting a role for breast CSCs in the metastatic process
of this disease [154, 161]. Furthermore, the Wnt pathway
regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an
important component of metastasis [162-165]. During
