Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cutaneous melanoma is epidemiologically linked to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), but the molecular
mechanisms by which UVR drives melanomagenesis remain unclear1,2. The most common
somatic mutation in melanoma is a V600E substitution in BRAF, which is an early event3. To
investigate how UVR accelerates oncogenic BRAF-driven melanomagenesis, we used
a V600EBRAF mouse model. In mice expressing V600EBRAF in their melanocytes, a single dose of
UVR that mimicked mild sunburn in humans induced clonal expansion of the melanocytes, and
repeated doses of UVR increased melanoma burden. We show that sunscreen (UVA superior:
UVB SPF50) delayed the onset of UVR-driven melanoma, but only provided partial protection.
The UVR-exposed tumours presented increased numbers of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and
we observed mutations (H39Y, S124F, R245C, R270C, C272G) in the Trp53 tumour suppressor
in ~40% of cases. TP53 is an accepted UVR target in non-melanoma skin cancer, but is not
thought to play a major role in melanoma4. However, we show that mutant Trp53
accelerated V600EBRAF-driven melanomagenesis and that TP53 mutations are linked to evidence
of UVR-induced DNA damage in human melanoma. Thus, we provide mechanistic insight into
epidemiological data linking UVR to acquired naevi in humans5. We identify TP53/Trp53 as a
UVR-target gene that cooperates with V600EBRAF to induce melanoma, providing molecular

We expressed V600EBRAF in the melanocytes of 2-month old mice6 and one month later,
protected half of the shaved backs of the mice with a cloth and exposed the other half to low
doses of UVR (Fig 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a, 1b). UVR upregulates Trp537, and within 24h
of a single UVR exposure we observed Trp53 staining in ~41% of epidermal keratinocytes
and down into the reticular dermis (Fig. 1b; Extended Data Fig. 1c, Table 1). We also
observed abundant sunburn cells (~17 cells/mm) in the basal layer of the UVR-exposed skin
(Fig. 1c; Extended Data Table 1). The skin did not blister, but after 24-48 hours it developed
mild erythema, and after seven days it was rough to the touch, presented fine desquamation
and was thickened due to hyperkeratosis, epidermal hypertrophy and a thickened fibrotic
dermis (Fig. 1d).
UVR induces melanocyte proliferation8, and naevogenesis is driven by clonal expansion of
melanocytes expressing mutant BRAF, the acquisition of which is an early event3.
Furthermore, the incidence of acquired human naevi, ~80% of which carry BRAF
mutations9, is linked to UVR exposure10. We show that UVR induced V600EBRAFmelanocyte proliferation in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 2) and within 7 days, the UVRexposed skin presented more abundant and larger naevi (Fig. 1d; Extended Data Fig. 3a-d;
Extended Data Table 2). These UVR-induced changes persisted (Fig. 1e) and the UVRexposed skin darkened (Fig. 1f). UVR did not induce naevi or skin darkening in
non-V600EBRAF mice (Extended Data Fig. 3e, 3f). Thus, we validate human
epidemiological studies by showing that V600EBRAF-expressing melanocytes are
susceptible to proliferation and naevogenesis driven by low-dose UVR that mimics mild
sunburn.

As reported6, V600EBRAF induced melanoma in ~70% of mice at a median latency of 12.6
months. On average each mouse developed 0.9 tumours on its back (Fig 2a, 2b). When
exposed to UVR, all V600EBRAF mice developed melanoma within 7 months at a median
latency of 5.3 months and an average of ~3.5 (range 1-6) tumours each, 98% (59/60) of
which were within the UVR-exposed area (Fig 2a-2c). UVR did not induce melanoma in
non-V600EBRAF mice (Fig. 2a). Thus, we concluded that UVR accelerated V600EBRAFdriven melanomagenesis.
The UVR and non-UVR tumours were asymmetrical, predominantly amelanotic and locally
destructive (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 4a, 4b). They invaded the deeper subcutis,
presented superficial naevi and pigmented cells and ~50% ulcerated the overlying epidermis
(Fig. 2e, 2f, Extended Data Fig. 4b). The tumour cells were atypical with dendritic/plump
spindle morphology, and S100 and Hmb45/MelanA positive (Fig. 2e, 2f, Extended Data Fig.
4c-e). They were heterogeneous, highly mitotic (20 mitoses/10 high-power fields; 10
tumours analysed) and Ki-67 positive (26.4%, range 10-50; Extended Data Fig. 4a, 4f).
Application of sunscreen (UVA superior, UVB SPF 50) 30 minutes before UVR exposure
blocked induction of Trp53 and apoptosis in the epidermal keratinocytes (Extended Data
Fig. 5a-c, Extended Data Table 1). These are largely UVB-driven responses7, but sunscreen

also blocked UVA-induced epidermal hypertrophy and dermal thickening (Extended Data
Fig. 5d). The cloth-protected and sunscreen-protected naevi were indistinguishable and
sunscreen prevented UVR-driven skin darkening (Extended Data Fig. 6a, 6b). Thus
sunscreen protected the epidermis from the immediate effects of UVA and UVB, but
nevertheless all of the sunscreen-protected UVR-exposed V600EBRAF-mice developed
tumours within 15 months at a median latency of 7.5 months (Fig. 2a), a significant
reduction compared to unprotected mice, but a significant increase compared to non-UVRexposed mice (p=0.03; Fisher Exact Test). Sunscreen protected mice developed ~1.5
tumours on their backs, again significantly fewer than unprotected mice, but significantly
more than non-UVR-exposed mice (Fig. 2b, 2c). The sunscreen-protected melanomas
presented similar histology to non-UVR and UVR-exposed melanomas (Fig. 2d-f, Extended
Data Fig. 6c) and were more common on sunscreen-protected (14 tumours) than clothprotected (8 tumours) skin. Thus, sunscreen only partially prevented acceleration
of V600EBRAF-driven melanomagenesis by UVR.

Array comparative genome hybridisation revealed no significant differences in gross
chromosomal aberrations or copy number variations between non-UVR and UVR
melanomas (Fig. 3a), but the non-UVR melanomas presented significantly more (60% vs.
13.3%) recurrent copy number changes in melanoma oncogenes and tumour suppressors
(MITF, BRAF, CCND1, CDKN2A; Fig. 3b; Supplementary Table 1)11. Whole exome
sequencing (WES) revealed that UVR-exposed melanomas presented significantly more
somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs; median 6.16 [range 0.26-40.69] vs. 0.19
SNVs/Mb [range 0.02–2.16]; Fig. 3c; Supplementary Table 1) and a significantly higher
proportion of C to T transitions (median 16.7% vs. 76.6%) at the 3′ end of pyrimidine
dimers than non-UVR tumours (Fig. 3d, 3e). This provides direct evidence of UVR-induced
DNA damage12 and notably, although sunscreen significantly reduced the number of SNVs
(median 0.25050 SNVs/Mb [range 0.08233 - 0.64432]) in UVR-exposed melanomas (Figure
3c and Supplementary Table 1), the tumours still presented a higher proportion of C to T
transitions at the 3′ end of pyrimidine dimers than non-UVR exposed melanomas (Fig. 3d,
3e). Thus, sunscreen reduced overall mutation burden but did not completely block UVRinduced DNA damage.
We observed Trp53 mutations in 6 of 15 UVR-exposed melanomas, 1 of 11 sunscreenprotected UVR-exposed melanomas, but none of 15 non-UVR-exposed tumours (Fig 4a;
Extended Data Table 3; Supplementary Table 1). We confirmed the Trp53 mutations (Fig.
4b; Extended Data Table 3a) and note that there were no significant differences in the
number of SNVs in the UVR-exposed Trp53-mutant and Trp53-wild-type tumours
(Extended Data Fig. 7a) suggesting that mutant Trp53 did not contribute to overall mutation
burden. The mutations involved codons H39, S124, R245, R270, C272 and 6/7 were C to T
transitions at the 3′ end of pyrimidine dimers (Extended Data Table 3a) supporting a direct
role for UVR in induction of Trp53 mutations in melanoma. S124, R245, R270 and C272
are in the Trp53 DNA-binding domain and the corresponding residues (S127, R248, R273,
C275) are mutated in human TP53 in melanoma (Extended Data Table 3a), producing
deleterious effects that severely impair promoter-specific TP53-transcriptional activity
(Extended Data Table 3b)13. R273 and R248 are human cancer mutation hotspots and

produce proteins with dominant-negative and other gain-of-function activities14-16. Nterminal TP53 mutations are rare and H39 is not conserved, but the equivalent residue (Q38)
is mutated in human cancer (Extended Data Table 3a). Notably, all of the mutant proteins
accumulated in our mouse melanomas (Fig. 4c; Extended Data Table 3a), suggesting
common functional consequences.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Two conditional-inducible mouse alleles for DNA-binding domain Trp53 mutants are
available, Trp53LSL-R172H and Trp53LSL-R270H. These mutant proteins are functionally
similar; they possess dominant-negative and gain-of-function activities, and they accumulate
in tumours16. The Trp53LSL-R172H mice were readily available, so we generated
heterozygous mice that expressed one copy of R172HTrp53 in their melanocytes
(Trp53+/LSL-R172H;Tyr::CreERT2+/). These mice did not develop melanoma, but when
crossed to the V600EBRAF mice (Trp53+/LSL-R172H::Braf+/LSL-V600E;Tyr::CreERT2+/o), all
of the mice developed on average 6 tumours (range 2-10) on their backs within 3.5 months
(Fig. 4d, 4e, 4f). The tumours presented the histopathological features of other V600EBRAFdriven melanomas (Fig 4g, 4h; Extended Data Fig. 7b). Thus, as with deletion of one copy
of the tumour suppressor Pten (Extended Data Fig. 7c)17, we show that mutant Trp53
accelerated BRAF-driven melanomagenesis (p<0.0001; Fisher Exact Test).
Finally, analysis of WES data from the Broad Institute18, The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA, https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) and Yale19 revealed that TP53 mutations
coincided with a higher proportion of C>T transitions and a UVR signature in primary and
metastatic humans cutaneous melanomas (Fig. 4i; Extended Data Fig. 7d; Extended Data
Table 3c). Thus, in human and mouse melanomas, Trp53/TP53 mutations were associated
with UVR-induced DNA damage, establishing that UVR accelerates melanomagenesis by
targeting TP53/Trp53.

TP53 is a recognised UVR target in non-melanoma skin cancers, but is thought not to play a
role in melanoma, because frequent p14ARF loss, stabilises HDM2, inactivating TP534.
However, we show that ~40% of mouse and ~20% of human melanomas with evidence of
UVR-induced DNA damage carried Trp53/TP53 mutations18. Trp53 gene deletions can
cooperate with V600EBRAF to induce melanoma in mice and fish20,21, but in UVR-exposed
melanomas TP53/Trp53 is mutated rather than lost, generating proteins with gain-offunction and dominant-negative activities14-16. This suggests a complex role for TP53/Trp53
in melanoma that cannot be accomplished if the protein is lost. Our data establish that TP53
is a bona fide UVR target in melanoma, providing insight into how UVR drives melanoma,
albeit through mechanisms that have not yet been elucidated. Mutant TP53 drives
tumourigenesis through processes inducing evasion of senescence, activation of autophagy,
engagement of DNA-damage responses and oxidative stress pathway reactivation, but
individual mutants influence these functions differently. Also, it was recently shown that
UVR stimulates melanoma invasion, but the role of TP53 in this remains unknown22.
Studies are required to elucidate the role of TP53 in melanoma and to identify other UVR
targets in TP53/Trp53 mutant and TP53/Trp53 wild-type tumours. Intriguingly, recurrent
UVR-signature mutations occur in RAC1, STK19 and PPP6C in melanoma, but their roles in
melanomagenesis are currently unknown18,19. It is also unclear what induces V600EBRAF

because it is not a UVR-signature mutation. Nevertheless, our data show that V600EBRAFexpressing melanocytes are susceptible to UVR-driven naevogenesis and melanomagenesis.

In previous UVR melanoma models, embryonic mice constitutively expressed oncogenes,
generally with loss of tumour suppressor genes, and the mice received a single burning dose
of UVR 1-3 days after birth23,24. In this model melanoma is driven by inflammation
mediated by IFN secreted by neonatal macrophages, and it does not accelerate V600EBRAFdriven melanoma25. We expressed V600EBRAF at physiological levels in adolescent mice
without manipulation of tumour suppressor genes and exposed the mice to repeated low
doses of UVR. Thus we mimicked both somatic mutation acquisition and mild sunburn in
humans, and our tumours were driven by acquired Trp53 mutations. Thus, we reveal two
UVR melanoma pathways, one driven by inflammation in neonates and one driven by UVRinduced mutations in adults.
Finally, it is accepted that sunscreen protects against squamous cell carcinoma26, but
controversy surrounds its’ ability to protect against melanoma27-29. The US Environmental
Protection Agency states that there is “no evidence that sunscreens protect you from
malignant melanoma” (http://www.epa.gov/sunwise/doc/sunscreen.pdf), but we establish
that sunscreen delayed UVR-driven melanoma in susceptible mice, validating public health
campaigns that promote its use for melanoma. However, sunscreen did not safeguard against
UVR completely and we advocate combining it with other sun avoidance strategies,
particularly in at-risk individuals with BRAF-mutant naevi1,30.

ONLINE-ONLY METHODS
Animal procedures

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

All procedures involving animals were approved by the Animal Ethics Committees of the
Institute of Cancer Research and Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute in accordance
with National Home Office regulations under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986
and according to the guidelines of the Committee of the National Cancer Research
Institute31. Tamoxifen (Sigma-Aldrich T5648) was freshly prepared in 100% ethanol. For
genotyping, genomic DNA was prepared from tail biopsies and PCR was performed using
the primers previously described6. Groups of >10 animals per cohort were based on
historical precedent to provide statistically significant survival rates in Kaplan-Meier
analysis. No randomisation or blinding were required. Animals were culled when tumour
burden reached ethical limits, if the animals displayed signs of ill health or distress, or
following a maximum of 24 months on study.

was expressed in female C57BL/6 mouse melanocytes by topical application of
tamoxifen to the shaved backs of mice at ~2 months of age. A month later mice were
anesthetized and the whole backs were shaved. Half of the shaved backs were covered
vertically with a UVR proof cloth, to provide an internal control for non UVR-exposed skin.
Each animal was treated with 160 mJ/cm2 UVA/UVB or 15 J/cm2 UVA (Waldmann
UV181 lamps fitted with UV 6 or UV A-1 tubes) each week for up to 6 months. For the

sunscreen protection experiments, mice were treated with Sunsense Milk Sunscreen SPF50
(FDA standard 2,2 mg/cm2,) by topical application 30 min before UVR exposure.
Histology and immunohistochemistry

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

For immunohistochemistry, samples were processed as described6. Briefly, sections were
deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated with a series of graded alcohol washes. Sections
were microwaved in citrate buffer (pH 6) for antigen retrieval and rinsed in PBS washes.
Sections were blocked in 1% BSA in PBS, incubated with 1:200 dilutions of anti-S100
(Dako), 1:100 dilutions of anti-Ki-67 (Santa Cruz), 1:200 dilutions of mouse anti-HMB45/
MelanA (Abcam), 1:100 Tp53 (Abcam) antibodies. Appropriate negative and positive
controls for specificity of staining were included and images were captured using Leica
DM4000 B LED automated upright microscope system.
Naevi quantification
For each animal, at least 3 samples of skin were collected. The skin sections were cut
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the animals to span the exposed and non-exposed
areas of the tamoxifen treated back. Two independent observers (observer 1 and 2, AV and
MC respectively) performed naevi quantification. For each animal, naevi were quantified in
3 different skin sections, 1.8 mm width each of UVR-exposed and protected skin.
Significance was tested with the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test. The size of the naevi was
measured by a single observer recording the largest diameter for each nevus in 10.8 mm skin
of UVR-exposed and non-exposed protected skin and significance tested using the U Mann
Whitney Test. Four animals were scored.
Tp53 quantification

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We quantified TP53 by scoring nuclear staining in 500 consecutive keratinocytes for each
mouse in UVR exposed, protected, and UVR + sunscreen treated skin. Four animals were
scored.
Sunburn cell quantification
We quantified sunburn cells in 1mm of interfollicular basal keratinocytes for each mouse in
UVR-exposed, protected, and UVR + sunscreen-treated skin. Four animals were scored.
Immunofluoresence (IF)
3 mm sections of formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) material were used. Slides were
dewaxed and antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer pH 6 followed by blocking
in PBS-Tween 0.1% + 1% BSA for 15 min and overnight incubation with anti ki67 (Santa
Cruz sc-7846) and S100 antibody (1:100 in PBS+1%BSA). Antibody detection was
performed using AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Slides were
counterstained with DAPI. Samples were analysed and pictures of the mid dermis were
taken using a Leica confocal scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems).

WES and aCGH

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

75 manually dissected sections of 20 μm snap frozen tissue samples with an estimated
tumour cell percentage of at least 80% were used for DNA extraction. Normal DNA was
isolated from liver or kidney. DNA extraction was performed using a DNeasy blood and
tissue kit (Qiagen). Quality assessment was performed by NanoDrop and Qubit. For aCGH,
2 μg of normal and tumour DNA were hybridized to Nimblegen HX3 MM9 whole genome
CGH arrays (100718_MM9_WG_CGH). Normalization, window averaging and
segmentation were conducted using the standard Nimblegen aCGH analysis pipeline. The
BioConductor package aCGH was used to summarise and plot copy number alterations. For
WES, 15 tumours from UVR-exposed areas, 15 tumours from animals not exposed to UVR
and 11 tumours from animals exposed to UVR and treated with sunscreen were included.
Matched normal DNA samples from liver or kidney were obtained. DNA was extracted
from frozen materials. Exome capture was performed using the Agilent SureSelect Mouse
exome capture kit 3 μg of gDNA according to the manufactures instructions. Sequencing
was performed on Illumina GAIIx and HiSeq machines to produce 74bp paired end reads
and quality control was conducted using FASTQC (http://
www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Reads were aligned to the NCBI m37
reference genome using BWA32 (version 0.5.9-r16; default parameters). Duplicate reads
were marked by Picard (http://picard.sourceforge.net/index.shtml) and base quality score
recalibration and local realignment around indels were performed using GATK33 (version
v1.2-24-g6478681). Pileup files of on-target high mapping quality bases (read mapping
quality ≥30) were generated using Samtools34 (version 0.1.18) and somatic single nucleotide
variants (SNVs) were called using Varscan35 (version v2.2.8) methods somatic (parameters
-min-var-freq 0.08, -p-value 0.05, -min-avg-qual 20) and processSomatic at positions with
coverage ≥10 in the normal and tumour. Likely false positives were removed using
predetermined filters35. The somatic mutational status of Trp53 in all tumour samples was
also verified using Somaticsniper36. No mutations in Trp53 in the NON-UVR melanoma
samples were identified by either method. Somatic variants were annotated by the Ensembl
Variant Effect Predictor37 using Ensembl version 67 and variants present in dbSNP were
excluded.
For Sanger sequencing validation, gDNA was amplified by PCR to confirm selected
mutations. The products were directly sequenced using dye-terminator chemistry as
previously described38. Sequences were visualized using Sequencher software. Primer
sequences are available upon request. 107 randomly selected SNVs were validated by
Sanger sequencing, to reveal a true positive rate of 93.5%.
