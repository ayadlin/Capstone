Abstract
Germline mutations of the retinoblastoma gene (RB1) predispose to both sporadic and radiation-induced
osteosarcoma, tumors characterized by high levels of genomic instability, and activation of alternative
lengthening of telomeres. Mice with haploinsufﬁciency of the Rb1 gene in the osteoblastic lineage reiterate the
radiation susceptibility to osteosarcoma seen in patients with germline RB1 mutations. We show that the
susceptibility is accompanied by an increase in genomic instability, resulting from Rb1-dependent telomere
erosion. Radiation exposure did not accelerate the rate of telomere loss but ampliﬁed the genomic instability
resulting from the dysfunctional telomeres. These ﬁndings suggest that telomere maintenance is a noncanonical
caretaker function of the retinoblastoma protein, such that its deﬁciency in cancer may potentiate DNA damageinduced carcinogenesis by promoting formation of chromosomal aberrations, rather than simply by affecting cellcycle control. Cancer Res; 73(14); 4247–55. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The Fukushima nuclear accident has reawakened concerns
about the long-term health consequences of radiation exposure, especially the risk of cancer and the contribution of
individual genetic susceptibility to that risk. However, little is
known about the cellular events that follow radiation exposure
and lead to the development of cancer in a susceptible individual (1).
Osteosarcoma is a tumor that is readily induced by exposure
to ionizing radiation, in particular through the deposition of
a-particle emitting radionuclides in the mineralizing skeleton.
This is reﬂected by the high osteosarcoma incidences in
luminescent dial painters who ingested large quantities of
radium salts (2), and in children treated with preparations of
thorium (3). Exposure of the skeleton to external photon
irradiation is also osteosarcomageneic, with this tumor being
a frequent secondary cancer arising in radiation therapy ﬁelds
(4).
Germline mutation of the RB1 tumor suppressor gene
increases sensitivity to both sporadic and radiation-induced
osteosarcoma (5–7). A study of the genetic determinants that

predispose inbred mouse strains to radiation-induced osteosarcoma after injection of bone-seeking 227Th revealed a major
modifying gene mapping to the Rb1 locus (8). Analysis of the
increased susceptibility to radiation that is associated with Rb1
is hindered by the high sporadic rate of cancer in animals
engineered to lack one copy of Rb1 in the germline (9).
However, the increased sensitivity to radiation could be reiterated in mice that had been rendered Rb1 haploinsufﬁcient
through the conditional deletion of one Rb1 allele in the
osteoblastic lineage (6).
Osteosarcomas are characterized by the frequent activation
of the alternative lengthening of telomeres pathway of telomere maintenance (10) and a high degree of genomic instability. As the loss of telomeric DNA may lead to karyotypic
instability (11), and as RB1 haploinsufﬁciency has been associated with increased genomic instability in premalignant
retinoma cells (12), we postulate that the Rb1 gene may be
the common denominator-linking susceptibility, genomic
instability, and telomeric integrity. We report here that the
loss of a single copy of the Rb1 gene is sufﬁcient to cause
sustained telomeric attrition and spontaneous genomic instability in cells of the osteoblastic lineage. The extent of the
genomic instability is increased after exposure to radiation.

of the Cre expression to the osteoblastic lineage of in vivo
was conﬁrmed using (FVB/N COL1AI-Cre-Tg  B6:129-Gtrosa26tm1Sor) mice (Supplementary Fig. S1). Inactivation of 1
allele of the Rb1 gene in the osteoblastic lineage was achieved
by mating FVB-COL1A1-Cre-Tg and FVB-Rb1loxP/loxP mice.
Primary osteoblast explant cultures
Long bones of 2- to 4-week-old offspring of FVB-COL1A1Cre-Tg  FVB-Rb1loxP/loxP mice were isolated as described
previously (16). In brief, long bones were excised under
sterile conditions and scraped free of adherent tissue. After
removal of the epiphyses, the bone marrow was ﬂushed
using 1 mL PBS. Fragments of the cleaned bone were placed
into 6-well dishes and cultured in 1 mL Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After
1 week, the emergent osteoblastic cells were replated to give
passage 1 (P1).
All cells were genotyped for Cre, Rb1, and the excised
Rb1þ/D19 locus (Supplemental Fig. S2A). For all studies, the
wild-type Rbþ/þ and Rb1þ/D19 cells used were Cre positive,
unless speciﬁcally stated otherwise. As expected, no Cre
mRNA transcripts were detectable in cultured osteoblasts
(Supplemental Fig. S3) due to the repression of the collagen
gene expression in the absence of differentiation-promoting
medium supplements (16).
Senescence-associated b-galactosidase assay
The assay was conducted using the b-gal staining kit (SigmaAldrich) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Micronuclei assay. The presence of DNA micronuclei
fragments was quantiﬁed using a standard protocol (17). A
total of 250,000 cells were seeded onto glass microscope slides
and 24 hours later were irradiated with either 2 or 4 Gy using an
Isovolt 200 X-ray device operating at 230 kVp and 20 mA, with a
1 mm Al and 0.5 mm Cu ﬁlter. Sham-irradiated cells were
handled in the identical manner without exposure to the Xirradiation. Cytochalasin B (0.5 mg/mL) was added to the
cultures for 18 hours at time 0 after irradiation to block the
next cytokinesis. Cells were subsequently ﬁxed in 80% ethanol
for 15 minutes. DNA was visualized using 4',6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI) staining (150 ng/mL) for 5 minutes. Slides
were washed in distilled H2O, air-dried and coverslip mounted
using 1 drop of Vectashield. Scoring of micronuclei in binucleate cells was done according to the HUMN project protocols.
Quantiﬁcation of anaphase bridges. The ﬁdelity of chromosomal segregation was determined by visualization of the
chromatin in postmitotic cells. A total of 250,000 cells per glass
slide were irradiated 24 hours after seeding at 0, 2, and 4 Gy. Cells
were grown for a further 48 hours to allow at least 4 cell divisions
(cycle time of approximately 12 hours). After ﬁxation in 80%
methanol for 15 minutes, the slides were stained with Hoechst
33342 for 5 minutes, washed twice with PBS, and coverslip
mounted with 1 drop of Vectashield. Scoring was done visually
by counting the number of bridges per 250 cells. Each cell
revealing a spontaneous or radiation induced anaphase bridge
was scored once, even if multiple bridges existed within that cell.
Chromatin bridges between 2 postmitotic daughter cells were
also scored and were considered to belong to 1 parental cell.

Propidium iodide labeling for FACS analysis of the cell
cycle. Cells were trypsinized, washed with 5 mL PBS, and spun
down at 1,400 rpm for 5 minutes 5 mL of 70% ethanol (cold)
was added while gently vortexing and left in ethanol at 4 C for 4
hours. The ﬁxed cells were spun down at 1,400 rpm for 5 minutes
and resuspended 475 mL PBS, plus 3.3 mL RNAse (30 mg/mL)
and 25 mL propidium iodide (1 mg/mL). Cell-cycle analysis was
conducted using a FACSCoulter (Becton Dickinson).
Telomeric staining by in situ FISH. Telomere length was
determined by in situ FISH labeling of genomic DNA (18).
Chromosome spreads or interphase nuclei were prepared by
incubating cells with 0.05 mg/mL Colcemid for 6 hours. Cells
were harvested, incubated in 0.056 M KCl at 37 C for 10
minutes and ﬁxed in methanol/acetic acid (3:1). Metaphase
chromosomes were spread on glass slides, air dried overnight,
and ﬁxed in 4% formaldehyde in 1  PBS for 4 minutes. To
conduct the hybridization, the samples were treated with 100
mg/mL RNase A in 2  single-strand conformational polymorphism at 37 C for 1 hour, dehydrated through an ethanol series
(70%, 85%, and 100% ethanol for 4 minutes each) at room
temperature and air dried. A hybridization mixture (70%
formamide, 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 10 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and 0.5 mg/mL ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) conjugated (C3TA2)3 peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe
(PANAGENE) was applied onto the slides. DNA was denatured
at 75 C for 5 minutes. Hybridizations were carried out at room
temperature for 4 hours. Slides were washed 2  15 minutes in
70% formamide, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and 3  5
minutes in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.08% Tween-20 (pH
7.5) at room temperature. Slides were covered with one drop of
Vectashield (containing 100 ng/mL DAPI for counterstaining)
and mounted with a coverslip.
Telomere length measurement by ﬂow cytometry (FlowFISH). FISH-labeled telomeres were quantiﬁed as previously
described (19). Primary cells in culture were washed in PBS and
centrifuged, the supernatant was discarded and 500.000 cells
resuspended in 500 mL of hybridization mixture containing
70% deionized formamide, 20 mmol/L Tris buffer, pH 7, 1%
BSA, and 0.3 mg/mL of the FITC-conjugated PNA probe.
Samples were denatured for 10 minutes at 80 C and left to
hybridize for 3 hours in the dark at room temperature. Samples
without PNA probe were used as negative control. Excess probe
was removed in a wash solution containing 70% formamide,
10 mmol/L Tris buffer (pH 7), 0.1% BSA, and 0.1% Tween-20
followed by 2 washes in PBS, 0.1% BSA, and 0.1% Tween-20.
Cells were then incubated in 500 mL PBS, 0.1% BSA, 10 mg/mL
RNAse A, and 0.1 mg/mL propidium iodide for 1 hour at 4 C
before analysis. All samples were stored on ice until analysis by
ﬂow cytometry.
Analysis was done on fresh samples using a FACSCoulter
(Becton Dickinson). The FITC signal was detected in the green
channel and the propidium iodide ﬂuorescence in the red
channel with no compensation set on the instrument.
Lentiviral expression vectors. RB1-expressing lentivirus
(LV-RB1) was produced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
ampliﬁcation of the RB1 cDNA insert of cDNA clone MGC
29887 (Life Technologies). The insert was cloned into the
lentiviral vector (pCDH-EF1-MCS-T2A-copGFP; Biocat). The

number was determined by real-time quantitative PCR of
genomic DNA (SybrGreen; Applied Biosystems). Relative copy
numbers of Mdm2 were calculated by the DDCt method, using
normal mouse tissue as the diploid reference. The primers used
for ampliﬁcation and sequencing are listed in the Supplementary Material.

Rb1 shRNA-expressing lentivirus (LV-shRb1) was generated by
insertion a short hairpin sequence targeting Rb1 (GCTTAAATCAGAAGAAGAA) into the pFUGW plasmid (20). Control
shRNA lentivirus (LV-scr) was generated using a scrambled
sequence (Dharmacon Research). Constructs were sequenced
to conﬁrm error-free ampliﬁcation before transduction. Creexpressing lentivirus under the control of the cytomegalovirus
(CMV) promoter with a green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)
expression cassette (LV526) for transduction control was
purchased from GenTarget. In this case, the control lentivirus
expressed only the GFP mRNA (LV-GFP).
Production of lentivirus was done as recently described (21).
For all lentiviral transductions, we used a multiplicity of
infection of 2 (2  105 cells per well and 4  105 TU/mL).
Transduction efﬁciency was determined 72 hours after infection by ﬂow-cytometric analysis of GFP-positive cells. Three or
4 days after infection cells were analyzed by reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR and Western blotting to ensure efﬁcacy of the
expression.

Haploinsufﬁciency of Rb1 leads to dysfunctional cellcycle arrest and senescence following radiation exposure
To conﬁrm the conditional deletion of 1 Rb1 allele and the
expected haploinsufﬁciency, we used exon-speciﬁc PCR to
amplify both wild-type and exon 19–deleted copies of the Rb1
gene. The content of the wild-type Rb1 allele was almost halved
in cells where the exon 19–deleted allele was present (Supplementary Fig. S2A). The same change was evident at both the
transcriptional (Supplementary Fig. S2C) and translational
levels (Fig. 1A and B) conﬁrming haploinsufﬁciency. No reduction of the remaining wild-type Rb1 allele was evident, even
after 22 continual passages (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
As expected from the known tumor suppressor role of Rb1 in
cell-cycle regulation, the reduced level of Rb1 altered the cellcycle kinetics, with a reduced number of cells present in both
the G1 and S phases assayed by ﬂow cytometry (Fig. 1C). The
presence of a large fraction of polyploid cells may account for

this shift as the population doubling time remained unaffected.
A functional deﬁcit in the cell-cycle checkpoints was evident
following a challenge with 2 Gy acute irradiation. In wild-type
cells, the expected rapid G2–M arrest after irradiation
was evident, but was severely abrogated in haploinsufﬁcient
Rb1þ/D19 cells (Fig. 1C). This was associated with a further
increase in the polyploid fraction but not the appearance of a
sub-G0 apoptotic fraction. Cell stress induced by the exposure
to ionizing radiation effectively induced senescence of wildtype cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, the induction
of senescence was diminished in haploinsufﬁcient cells, even
following a 4 Gy exposure (Fig. 2A).
Rb1 haploinsufﬁciency is associated with sporadic
increases in micronuclei formation and the polyploid
cell fraction
Possible alterations in the stability of the genome in Rb1
haploinsufﬁcient cells were studied by examining micronuclei
and polyploidy. The number of spontaneous micronuclei
(acentric fragments of genomic DNA; Fig. 2B) was elevated in
Rb1þ/D19 cells when compared to Rb1 proﬁcient wild-type cells.
As with the polyploid fraction, the number of cells showing
micronuclei rose with increasing passage number. Polyploid
cells were also present in wild-type osteoblasts, where they also
showed an increase in numbers at higher passages (Fig. 2C). In
contrast, the size of the polyploid cell fraction in haploinsufﬁ-

cient Rb1þ/D19 cells increased dramatically with increasing
passage numbers, comprising almost 25% of the population
by passage 12 (Fig. 2C). Even though we are unable to deﬁnitively determine the origin of the polyploid cells a dot plot of
cell size versus DNA content of the haploinsufﬁcient cells
indicates that a small percentage of the measured G2–M
population are possibly an uncertain overlap of tetraploid
G1 cells.
The spontaneous genomic instability of the Rb1
haploinsufﬁcient cells is accompanied by increased
telomere attrition
The stability of telomeric regions is associated with loss of
genome stability. We therefore quantiﬁed telomeric integrity
after loss of 1 Rb1 allele. Labeling of telomeric DNA sequences
with the ﬂuorescent Cy3-PNA telomeric DNA probe revealed
the presence of telomeric DNA within the micronuclei in both
wild-type and Rb1þ/D19 cells at passage 11. The Rb1 haploinsufﬁcient cells exhibited more than 2 times the number of
telomere-positive micronuclei than the wild-type cells (Fig.
2D). An examination of interphase cells indicated an overall
reduction in the level of PNA-labeled telomeric sequences in
Rb1þ/D19 cells, compared to their wild-type counterparts.
Labeling of metaphase spreads revealed that the decrease in
telomeric signal strength was due to a general reduction in
signal intensity and to the development of considerable

heterogeneity in the labeling intensity of different chromosomes in Rb1þ/D19 primary osteoblastic cells (Fig. 3A).
Assay of telomere length using quantitative genomic PCR
ampliﬁcation (Fig. 3B and C) established that there was a
global reduction in telomere repeats in the Rb1þ/D19 cells that
coincided with the reduced PNA labeling. As with the parameters describing genomic instability, the reduction in the
average telomere lengths of Rb1þ/D19 cells grew larger with
subsequent passages compared to wild-type cells. The mean
number of 102 telomeres detected in wild-type cell at passage 8
approached the theoretical mean value of 108 telomeres that
would be expected, taking into account the relative numbers of
diploid and tetraploid cells we observed in asynchronous
cultures. The number of distinct PNA-labeled telomeres in
Rb1þ/D19 cells was reduced by more than half (Fig. 3D).
Telomeric loss is induced by shRNA-mediated
knockdown of Rb1 expression
To conﬁrm that the engineered Rb1 haploinsufﬁciency is
indeed responsible for the observed changes, we studied the
effect of a direct knockdown of Rb1. Wild-type and haploinsufﬁcient Rb1þ/D19 cells were transduced with the LV-shRb1
lentivirus, This lead to the expected reduction in Rb1 expres-

sion (Supplementary Fig. S4) and was associated with a reduction in telomere length as early as the third passage posttransduction in both wild-type and haploinsufﬁcient cells,
compared to the same cells transduced instead with the LVscr control lentivirus (Fig. 3E). The decrease in telomere length
was more pronounced when LV-shRb1 was used to further
deplete the already reduced Rb1 expression of the Rb1þ/D19
cells (Fig. 3E).
Transduction of Cre negative wild-type (Rb1þ/þ) cells and of
Cre negative cells containing a nondeleted ﬂoxed Rb1 allele
(Rb1þ/ﬂox) with the Cre-expressing lentivirus resulted in in vitro
Cre expression (Supplementary Fig. S5). Telomere shortening
was observed in the Cre-expressing primary osteoblasts containing the nondeleted ﬂoxed Rb1 allele (Rb1þ/ﬂox) but not in
the Cre-expressing wild-type (Rb1þ/þ) cells 3 passages after
transduction (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Telomere loss and genomic instability in Rb1þ/D19
haploinsufﬁcient cells are prevented by expression of
RB1
As a ﬁnal proof of the role of Rb1 in telomere maintenance,
we followed telomeric status after restoration of Rb1 expression. The accelerated rate of telomere loss in Rb1þ/D19 cells

could be prevented by transduction with LV-RB1 lentivirus
whereas transduction with control LV-GFP lentivirus had no
effect, with telomere shortening continuing unabated (Fig. 4A).
The expression of RB1 in the haploinsufﬁcient Rb1þ/D19 cells
rescued the increased level of sporadic genomic instability, as
measured by the number of anaphase bridges per metaphase
plate (Fig. 4B). The expression of RB1 following transduction
was equivalent to that of endogenous Rb1 in wild-type cells
(Supplementary Fig. S7) and did not cause cell-cycle arrest.
Thus, the proportion of cells in G1, S, and G2–M phase were
comparable to those of wild-type cells at the same passage
(38.5%, 21.5%, and 40% vs. 39.6%, 22.8%, and 37.6%).
Telomere attrition is not a consequence of changed
oncogene/suppressor gene activity
The direct sequencing of the p53, Cdkn2a/Arf, and the
remaining wild-type Rb1 allele in Rb1þ/D19 cells at the 12th
passage did not reveal any alterations in the coding regions of
these genes. In addition, the copy number of the Mdm2
oncogene was shown to be the same as that found in wildtype tissue (Supplementary Fig. S8). P53 expression was undetectable in wild-type and haploinsufﬁcient Rb1þ/D19 cells, but
in a subclone of apparently spontaneously transformed cells
detected in long-term cultures of Rb1þ/D19 cells, we were able to
detect a point mutation in exon 8 of the p53 gene, leading to
accumulation of immunoreactive p53 protein (Supplementary
Fig. S9).
Radiation exposure increases genomic instability of Rb1
haploinsufﬁcient cells
The double-strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation may
promote genomic instability in cells already rendered susceptible by lack of telomeres. Consequently, we exposed haploinsufﬁcient Rb1þ/D19 cells to an acute dose of radiation. The
exposure to ionizing radiation caused cytogenetic abnormalities (micronuclei) in equal numbers of wild-type and haploin-

sufﬁcient Rb1þ/D19 cells 24 hours after exposure, attesting to
the uniformity of the radiation ﬁeld (Supplementary Fig.
S10; Fig. 5A). However, the number of micronuclei induced in
2 Gy irradiated haploinsufﬁcient Rb1þ/D19 cells greatly
exceeded that induced by the same exposure in wild-type cells
(Fig. 5B) from 1.45  0.13 in the wild-type to 2.2  0.26 in the
haploinsufﬁcient cultures. The number of radiation-induced
anaphase bridges in Rb1þ/D19 cells was more than 4-fold higher
than that in irradiated wild-type cells (Fig. 5C). The size of the
polyploid cell fraction was also increased by radiation exposure
in both wild-type and Rb1þ/D19 cells. The number of polyploid
cells arising in the irradiated haploinsufﬁcient Rb1þ/D19 cells
was considerably greater (29.6%) than that seen in the irradiated wild-type cells (2.8%; Fig. 5D). Importantly, the radiation
exposure did not inﬂuence the telomere length in either the
wild-type or haploinsufﬁcient cells (Fig. 5E). Telomeric DNA
was present in both acentric fragments (micronuclei) and
anaphase bridges (Fig. 5F), indicating involvement of the
truncated telomeres in the radiation-induced increase in
genomic instability.

Discussion
Loss of one copy of the retinoblastoma gene (RB1) increases
predisposition to the development of both sporadic and radiation-induced osteosarcoma (4, 22). The increase in sensitivity
to radiation-induced osteosarcoma is reiterated in a mouse
model upon conditional inactivation of the Rb1 gene in the
osteoblastic lineage (6). We now show that loss of only one Rb1
allele in nontransformed primary osteoblast cell cultures is
accompanied by a number of hallmarks of genomic instability.
Thus, in Rb1þ/D19 cells, as well as in cells where the endogenous
Rb1 expression was suppressed by shRNA, we observe the
appearance of a polyploid cell fraction, the presence of sporadic micronuclei (acentric DNA fragments), and extreme
shortening of the telomeric DNA. Restoration of the Rb1 status
by lentiviral expression of the human RB1 gene was sufﬁcient

to 2 Gy in Rb1

to prevent the continued increase in instability. These observations are consistent with a role for Rb1 in maintaining
telomere integrity and ultimately genomic stability.
Reduced telomere length is closely associated with increasing numbers of completed cell cycles. This raises the formal
possibility that the shortened telomeres in haploinsufﬁcient
Rb1þ/D19 cells may have arisen through accelerated cell division. However, no proliferation-promoting mutations were
detected in the tumor suppressor genes Cdkn2a/Arf and p53
nor alterations of copy number changes in the oncogene Mdm2
or in the remaining wild-type Rb1 allele. Thus, there is only a
small likelihood of expansion of a rapidly proliferating clone of
mutant cells. Moreover, the in vitro deletion of the ﬂoxed Rb1
allele by lentiviral-mediated expression of the Cre-recombinase resulted in telomere loss within 3 passages. Wild-type
cells would require more than 12 passages to reduce telomere
length to that induced 3 passages after the loss of the ﬂoxed Rb1

allele, making it unlikely that telomeric losses can be explained
simply by increased proliferation.
A direct action of the Cre recombinase on telomere length
can also be excluded as the collagen transgene–driving Cre
expression is not active in the undifferentiated osteoblast cells
studied in vitro, leading to undetectable levels of Cre in these
cells (16). The presence of lentiviral expressed Cre recombinase
also had no effect on the telomere length of wild-type cells,
indicating that the recombinase plays no part in the telomere
shortening. The telomere reduction showed a consistent relationship to the copy number of the Rb1 gene, with attrition
increasing further when the remaining wild-type allele was
targeted by shRNA knockdown, and reduced attrition when the
deﬁciency in retinoblastoma was reversed by expression of
RB1.
Exposure of haploinsufﬁcient Rb1þ/D19 cells to ionizing
radiation raised the level of instability, as indicated by

increases in the polyploid fraction, in failed chromosomal
segregation, and the appearance of acentric DNA fragments.
All 3 parameters reveal levels of instability that are far above
those that are induced by the exposure of wild-type cells to
radiation. The presence of telomeric DNA within both acrocentric fragments and anaphase bridges in irradiated cells
suggests involvement of the shortened telomeres. This is
consistent with the formation and breakage of end-to-end
fusions between chromosomes capped by truncated telomeres
or between truncated telomeres and radiation-induced double-strand breaks (23, 24). Such fused chromosomes would be
subject to physical tension at the next cytokinesis, causing
random breakage with the potential to form chromatin bridges
and micronuclear fragments during the next cell cycle (25).
Such repeated cycles of breakage-fusion-breakage (BFB) would
continually increase the level of instability, as we have observed
in the haploinsufﬁcient Rb1þ/D19 cells. In support of this, we
observed that telomere length was unaffected by radiation
exposure. This indicates that the increased instability arises
due to the combination of the induced DNA damage and the
preexisting truncated telomeres.
The loss of one copy of the Rb1 gene, and the resultant
haploinsufﬁciency, impaired the ability of the cells to handle
radiation-induced stress by either G2–M arrest or senescence.
Impairment of both of these Rb1-dependent DNA damagerestoring functions that follow cell stress (23, 26, 27) may
explain the persistence polyploid cells generated by the
increased genomic instability. The concomitant loss of the
canonical cell-cycle regulatory function of Rb1 would prevent
cells with chromosomal damage from entering G1–S arrest
and subsequently entering the apoptosis or senescence pathways. This sequence of events is consistent with the existence
of a mutator phenotype originally proposed by Loeb (28) to
explain the appearance of mutations in tumor cells at a rate
above that predicted from the sporadic mutation rate alone.
The duality of action (cell cycle and telomere length) that
we ascribe to Rb1 can explain the increases susceptibility to
both sporadic and radiation-induced osteosarcoma that is
associated with retinoblastoma gene mutations (4, 6). This
may also give an explanation for the high levels of chromo-

somal rearrangements that is frequently observed in osteosarcoma, and more recently in retinoma before the loss of the
second RB1 allele (12).
Another major component of the Rb1 pathway, P16INK4A,
has been shown to promote telomere erosion, formation of
anaphase bridges, and genomic instability in tumors of epithelial origin (29). The function of the retinoblastoma gene
product in maintaining genomic instability has been suggested
to involve chromosome condensation (30), centromere function, and mitosis-related genomic instability (31, 32). However,
these previous studies indicate an apparently paradoxical
situation, where loss of the retinoblastoma family members
p107 and Rb2/p130, but not of Rb1 itself, were seen to promote
telomere lengthening (33, 34). This prompts us to speculate
that there is a balance between mutually antagonistic interactions of the retinoblastoma family of proteins that serve to
regulate telomeric length.
