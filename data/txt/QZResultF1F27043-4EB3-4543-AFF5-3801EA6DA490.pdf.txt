ABSTRACT
Ultraviolet radiation B (UVB) is the main cause of DNA damage in epidermal
cells; and if not repaired, this DNA damage leads to skin cancer. In earlier
studies, we have reported that natural flavonolignan silibinin exerts strong
chemopreventive efficacy against UVB-induced skin damage and carcinogenesis;
however mechanistic studies are still being actively pursued. Here, we investigated
the role of nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway in silibinin’s efficacy to
repair UVB-induced DNA damage. Normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) were
exposed to UVB (1 mJ/cm2) with pre- or post- silibinin (100 μM) treatment, and
cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) formation/repair was measured. Results
showed that post-UVB silibinin treatment accelerates DNA repair via activating
the NER pathway including the expression of XPA (xeroderma pigmentosum
complementation group A), XPB, XPC, and XPG. In UVB exposed fibroblasts, silibinin
treatment also increased p53 and GADD45α expression; the key regulators of the
NER pathway and DNA repair. Consistently, post-UVB silibinin treatment increased
the mRNA transcripts of XPA and GADD45α. Importantly, silibinin showed no effect
on UVB-induced DNA damage repair in XPA- and XPB-deficient human dermal
fibroblasts suggesting their key role in silibinin-mediated DNA damage repair.
Moreover, in the presence of pifithrin-α, an inhibitor of p53, the DNA repair efficacy
of silibinin was compromised associated with a reduction in XPA and GADD45α
transcripts. Together, these findings suggest that silibinin’s efficacy against UVBinduced photodamage is primarily by inhibiting NER and p53; and these findings
further support silibinin’s usage as a potential inexpensive, effective, and non-toxic
agent for skin cancer chemoprevention.

States. Epidemiological and molecular data strongly
suggest that more than 90% of NMSCs are associated
with excessive exposure to solar ultraviolet B (UVB)
(290–320 nm) radiation [1]. The primary lesions caused by
UVB are cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6–4
photoproducts (6–4 PPs). These lesions, if not repaired
or removed, could give rise to mutations and cancer
initiation. Subsequent selection and multiplication of these
initiated cells results in further accumulation of mutations,
ultimately leading to the development of skin tumors [2].

INTRODUCTION
Skin cancer is the most common cancer with more
than 3 million cases diagnosed annually in the United
States. This is roughly equivalent to the annual incidence
of all other malignancies combined. Basal cell carcinoma
(BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), together
known as non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), account
for about 95% of all skin cancer cases in the United

UVB-induced DNA damage is mainly repaired
by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway [3–5].
NER operates by global genomic repair (GGR), which
removes lesions genome-wide, and transcription-coupled
repair (TCR), which removes lesions specifically from
DNA strands at actively transcribing genes. While the
initial damage recognition is different in these two
pathways, both pathways involve similar subsequent
steps of excision of short damage-containing DNA
segments, repair synthesis of a new DNA strand and
finally DNA ligation of the new strand to the parental
strand [4]. Defects in NER are associated with several
human autosomal recessive hereditary disorders such as
xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne’s syndrome
(CS) [3, 4]. The National Institutes of Health in a four
decade follow up study found that in 65% of XP patients
with skin cancer, NMSCs risk was increased 10,000-fold
and melanoma risk was increased 2000-fold in patients
under age 20 [6]. Overall, patients suffering from XP
and CS exhibit extreme sensitivity to sun exposure and
a marked predisposition to skin cancer, which clearly
suggests an important role for DNA repair genes in the
etiology of skin cancer.
NER is a complex process and requires more
than 20 proteins with different functions in order to
repair DNA [4, 7, 8]. First, CPDs and 6–4 PPs are
recognized by protein complexes including the XPE
and XPC gene products. After recognizing a lesion,
TFIIH (transcription factor IIH) is recruited by XPC to
open the DNA helix around the damage site. TFIIH is a
multiprotein complex with several enzymatic activities
including helicase (XPB and XPD) and kinase (cdk7)
functions [4, 9]. Both helicases allow the unwinding
of DNA upon which, the three dimensional structure is
able to recruit XPA and RPA which are believed to join
the TFIIH-repair complex to verify the nature of DNA
structural alteration [4, 10]. Next, two endonucleases
XPF-ERCC1 and XPG are recruited to the damage
site to cleave damage-containing DNA, leading to
the excision of ~24–32 nucleotides [4, 11]. Finally,
DNA structure is restored by subsequent gap-filling
DNA re-synthesis with the aid of auxiliary factors like
PCNA [12]. Importantly, the NER repair machinery is
inhibited by UVB-exposure [13], and unrepaired DNA
photoproducts cause specific mutations (UVB-signature)
in susceptible genes. For example, UVB-signature
mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene is the most
common event in SCC development. The mutational
inactivation of p53 compromises NER, as p53 normally
regulates the expression of several NER molecules and
initiates key events during NER [14–18]. Consistently,
loss of p53 in human cells results in reduced repair of
UV-induced DNA damage, as observed in Li-Fraumeni
syndrome patients [14, 17]. Therefore, non-toxic agent/s
that activate both p53 and NER machinery could be

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

important towards reducing UVB-induced photodamage
and skin carcinogenesis.
Silibinin is a bioactive flavonolignan present
in milk thistle (Silybum marianum) that has shown
chemopreventive efficacy against several malignancies
including skin cancer, as well as hepatoprotective,
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects [19, 20].
Silibinin has a long history of use in traditional medicine
systems for the treatment of several liver disorders
[20]. Previous studies from our laboratory have clearly
shown that silibinin reduces UVB-induced photodamage
including CPDs formation by activating p53 in epidermal
cells both in cell culture and animal models [21–23].
However, silibinin’s effect on NER pathway especially in
the context of silibinin-induced activation of p53 has not
yet been studied. Results from the present study provide
concrete evidence that silibinin promotes UVB-induced
DNA damage repair via activating NER machinery and
p53 is critical therein.

RESULTS
Silibinin repairs UVB-induced DNA damage in
NHDFs
First, we optimized the UVB-dose that causes
reparable DNA damage in NHDFs. Interestingly, we
could not apply UVB doses (50–100 mJ/cm2) previously
used in JB6 mouse epidermal cells [23, 24], as NHDFs
underwent excessive DNA damage and were unable to
repair the damage. We reduced the UVB dose gradually
and found that when exposed to a 1 mJ/cm2 UVB
dose, NHDFs did not die and were able to repair DNA
damage. Henceforth, a 1 mJ/cm2 UVB dose was selected
for all subsequent experiments. Next, we analyzed the
effect of silibinin (100 μM) treatment pre- or postUVB (1 mJ/cm2) exposure on DNA damage (CPDs)
repair in NHDFs. As shown in Figure 1A, silibinin
treatment 6 hrs prior to UVB exposure reduced CPD
levels by 50% (p < 0.05). Next, cells were exposed to
UVB and immediately treated with silibinin for 4, 6 and
8 hrs. Post-UVB silibinin treatment also resulted in an
accelerated DNA repair response with a 55% (p < 0.05)
reduction in CPD levels compared to UVB alone after 8
hrs (Figure 1B).
Previous experiments from our laboratory have
consistently indicated that silibinin treatment accelerates
the repair of CPDs caused by UVB radiation in both
JB6 mouse epidermal cells and in SKH-I mouse skin,
and that the mechanism responsible for this faster CPD
removal was regulated by p53 and GADD45α increase
[21, 23]. Accordingly, we next determined if p53 activity
was correlated with the observed reduction in CPDs with
silibinin treatment in NHDFs. For this, we used the p53
inhibitor pifithrin-α. Prior to assaying with pifithrin-α,

and then exposed to UVB (1 mJ/cm2). Immediately following UVB exposure, cells were trypsinized and cell pellets collected for DNA
extraction. Slot blot was performed to detect CPDs; thereafter, membranes were stripped and reprobed with single stranded DNA antibody
and bands were visualized using Odyssey IR detection system. B. NHDFs were exposed to 1 mJ/cm2 UVB, treated with silibinin (100 μM)

silibinin and/or pifithrin did not affect the viability of NHDFs. NHDFs were treated with silibinin (100 μM) and/or pifithrin (7 μM) with
or without UVB (1 mJ/cm2) exposure for 24 hrs and cell viability was assessed. The graph represents % viable cells mean ± SEM of three

In each case, graph represents the amount of CPDs normalized to the control cells (UVB-treated cells) and presented as mean ± SEM of 3

we tested the cytotoxicity of our treatments on NHDFs
cells, and found that cell viability was not significantly
decreased by 1 mJ/cm2 UVB dose, silibinin (100 μM)
and/or pifithrin-α (7 μM) even after 24 hrs of treatment
(Figure 1C). Thus, we proceeded with our experiments
and cells were exposed to UVB and immediately treated
with DMSO, silibinin (100 μM), silibinin (100 μM) +
pifithrin-α (7 μM) or pifithrin-α (7 μM) alone for 8 hrs.
DNA was extracted from the cells and evaluated by slot
blot method. As shown in Figure 1D, post-UVB silibinin
treatment for 8 hrs significantly reduced CPD levels
compared to UVB exposure alone; however, silibininactivated DNA damage repair was completely blocked in
the presence of pifithrin-α. Cells treated with pifithrin-α
alone did not have significantly different CPD levels
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure 1D). These results further supported our
previous findings that p53 is indispensable for the DNA
repair efficacy of silibinin. All the data in Figure 1A, 1B
& 1D for CPD levels also showed equal DNA loading
employing anti-ss DNA antibody.

Silibinin increases p53 and GADD45α expression
in UVB-exposed NHDFs
After observing that the DNA repair effects of
silibinin were lost when p53 was inhibited, we next
investigated the effect of silibinin on p53 and its
downstream effectors (GADD45α and p21) in UVBexposed NHDFs. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, p53
expression was increased in UVB-exposed NHDFs

compared to basal p53 expression in UVB-unexposed
cells. Silibinin treatment of UVB-unexposed cells did
not increase p53 expression; however, silibinin treatment
prior to UVB exposure did increase p53 levels in NHDFs,
though not statistically significantly (Figure 2A and 2B).
Silibinin treatment for 4 hrs following UVB-exposure
resulted in a significant increase in p53 expression that
was completely eliminated in the presence of pifithrin-α
(Figure 2A and 2B). Next, we evaluated the expression of
the p53 effectors, GADD45α and p21, as these molecules
are also involved in DNA repair and in addition, confirm
p53 activation. As shown in Figure 2A and 2C, silibinin
treatment pre- or post-UVB exposure increased GADD45α
levels, which was decreased in the presence of pifithrin-α
but these changes were not statistically significant. A
similar pattern in p21 expression was also observed
following silibinin treatment pre- or post-UVB exposure
in NHDFs (data not shown).

UVB-exposure or following UVB exposure showed no
significant effect on CPD levels in these two XP deficient
fibroblasts (Figure 6A and 6B). These results clearly
suggest the important role of XPA and XPB in silibininactivated UVB-induced DNA damage repair. These
results also suggest that the DNA repair effect of silibinin
treatment prior to UVB exposure is not a radiation filtering
or sunscreen effect.

DISCUSSION
The present study provides the first detailed
mechanistic evidence on the activation of NER machinery
and DNA repair by silibinin in UVB-exposed human
dermal fibroblasts. These findings are important because
silibinin not only increased the spatial-temporal presence
of NER factors in UVB exposed cells but also stimulated
mRNA production of some of the factors involved in DNA
damage repair. These results also suggest the preventive
efficacy of silibinin as its pre-treatment reduced UVBinduced DNA damage, probably through conditioning the
cells for a faster NER response rather than a sunscreen
effect. Furthermore, our results also suggested the
important role of p53 and GADD45α in the DNA repair
effects of silibinin via regulating several components
of the NER pathway. This is in tandem with a recently
published study where we reported that silibinin treatment
promoted UVB-induced DNA damage repair via p53
and GADD45α activation in JB6 cells by inducing a cell
cycle arrest [23]. Consistent with this, it has been reported
by us that silibinin has strong chemopreventive effects
against UVB-induced photocarcinogenesis in vivo in p53
wild type mice [21, 25–27]. More importantly, recently
we observed that silibinin failed to prevent UVB-induced
skin tumors in p53 knock-out mice (our non-published
observations); further supporting the findings that p53 is
necessary for the photodamage repair effects of silibinin.
Currently, we are characterizing the effect of silibinin on
NER pathway following UVB-exposure in both p53 wild
type and p53 knock-out mice.
In NER machinery, the XPC protein is considered
indispensable for DNA damage recognition [28], and it
has been reported that p53 activates XPC in response to
DNA damage [16]. Wang et al. reported that the total
cellular levels of XPC and XPB were similar in both p53wild type and p53-null cells but p53 played a pronounced
role in the damage recognition and subsequent assembly
of repair machinery during GGR [14]. In another study,
the same research group examined p53 role in XPC
induction in response to DNA damage in p53-wild type
and p53-null cells, and found that the XPC DNA damage
recognition factor is controlled transcriptionally by p53
through its downstream protein DDB2 [29]. They found
that the UV radiation-induced redistribution of XPC was
equally compromised in p53-deficient as well as DDB2deficient human cells [29]. When they restored DDB2

Silibinin activates NER machinery in
UVB-exposed NHDFs
Next, we examined silibinin’s effect on molecules
involved in the NER pathway. As shown in Figure 3
(and quantified in Figure 4), silibinin treatment postUVB exposure strongly increased XPA levels which
was not reduced in the presence of pifithrin-α; however,
we observed a decrease or no significant change in the
expression of XPB and XPC, respectively, under similar
treatment conditions. Interestingly, we observed a strong
increase in XPG and XPF expression with silibinin
treatment 4 hrs following UVB exposure (Figures 3 & 4).
Next, to understand the mechanisms underlying the
observed changes in NER related molecules, we examined
the effect of silibinin treatment on the mRNA levels of these
molecules via RT-PCR. As shown in Figure 5A–5E, silibinin
treatment 3 hrs after UVB exposure increased XPA expression
which was decreased by pifithrin-α; but there was no change
in the mRNA level of other NER molecules (XPB, XPC, and
XPG) suggesting that post-transcriptional/translational events
could be the possible mechanisms involved in their increased
expression. Importantly, GADD45α mRNA expression
was also significantly increased by silibinin treatment
3 hrs following UVB-exposure; however, GADD45α was
not decreased in the presence of pifithrin-α suggesting the
involvement of transcription factors other than p53. We also
did not observe any change in the mRNA levels of DDB1,
DDB2 and p53 under any of the above mentioned treatment
conditions (data not shown).

fibroblasts from xeroderma pigmentosum patients deficient

function, the recruitment of XPC to DNA damage sites
in situ was enhanced as well as the global repair of CPDs
[29]. Results from the present study showed that XPC
expression was slightly increased by silibinin in UVBexposed NHDFs; however, silibinin treatment did not
increase DDB2 mRNA transcript after UVB exposure.
There could be a possibility that DDB2 is activated earlier
than the time-point we studied (3 hrs), suggesting the
need for a detailed time-course study to further establish
silibinin’s effect on key molecules involved in DNA
damage recognition following UVB exposure.
XPB helicase, as a part of the TFIIH complex, is
involved in the unwinding of the DNA complex at the
site of damage. TFIIH contains a total of ten subunits,
four of which have detectable enzymatic activities. Cdk7
possesses RNAPII kinase activity, both XPB and XPD
have DNA helicase and ATPase activities and p44 has
ubiquitin ligase activity. XPB has been reported to have
roles in the NER pathway as well as in transcription [30].
It has been shown that p53 can bind to the TFIIH helicase
sub-units, XPB and XPD, and modulates their helicase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

activity. Other reports have pointed out that the XPB and
XPD helicases are also components of the p53 initiated
apoptotic pathway [31, 32]. Wang et al. performed colocalization experiments on NER factors which showed
that in normal human cells, XPC and TFIIH were rapidly
recruited to damaged DNA [14]. On the other hand, the
recruitment of XPC and TFIIH to damaged DNA was
considerably less efficient in p53-null or p53-compromised
cells [14, 32]. Our results clearly showed that the DNA
repair efficacy of silibinin was completely compromised
in XPB-deficient fibroblasts. However, further studies are
warranted to understand silibinin’s effect on other key
molecules in the TFIIH complex and their role in the DNA
repair efficacy of silibinin.
The importance of the XPA factor is evident in
patients harboring mutations in the gene as they have a
skin cancer prone phenotype; and also XPA –/– mice are
prone to skin tumors development [33]. Li et al. examined
the effect of the transcriptional function of p53 on XPA
nuclear import in A549 cells which were pre-incubated
with pifithrin-α before the UV treatment [34]. They
39602

reported that pifithrin-α significantly reduced UV-induced
XPA nuclear import as compared to DMSO-treated
cells [34]. Their data suggested that p53 may regulate
control UV-induced nuclear import of XPA through its
transcriptional activity [34]. Results from our present
study also showed that silibinin increases XPA expression
in UVB-exposed NHDFs. Moreover, the DNA repair
efficacy of silibinin was compromised in XPA-deficient
fibroblasts. These results clearly suggest that XPA is
critical to the DNA damage repair induced by silibinin.
XPG is an endonuclease and it is indispensable for
the operation of NER machinery. XPG cleaves the DNA
strand at the 3′ extreme of DNA damage, and XPG binding
stabilizes the pre-incision complex and it is essential for
5′ end cleavage by the ERCC1/XPF endonuclease [11,
35–37]. It has been shown that the recruitment of XPG
requires functional TFIIH and that the binding of XPG
to damaged DNA does not require DDB2 [38]. XPG has
been reported to suppress UV-induced apoptosis in human
fibroblasts [38]. Also, it plays role in the transcription by
RNA polymerases I and II [39, 40] and in the recruitment
of the PC4 (Human positive cofactor 4) transcription
factor to DNA lesions [41]. XPG needs XPA and RPA
to be present to perform the 3′ incision and the physical
presence of XPG is required for the 5′ incision activity
of ERCC1-XPF on damaged DNA [35, 36]. Our results
showed that silibinin treatment strongly increased the
XPG and XPF protein expression when applied after
UVB exposure. However, the mRNA level of XPG and
XPF was not significantly changed by silibinin suggesting
the need to further understand silibinin’s effect on posttranslational mechanism/s involved in the stabilization of
these proteins following UVB-exposure in NHDFs.
Taken together, these novel findings clearly suggest
that silibinin exerts its DNA damage repair effects through
activating multiple players involved in the NER pathway,
and that this effect is mostly as a result of p53 activity,
as silibinin’s efficacy was severely compromised when
p53 was inhibited. Overall, these results, together with
our others recently published studies, further support
silibinin’s usage as a potential inexpensive, effective, and
non-toxic agent for skin cancer chemoprevention.

day, NHDFs were exposed to UVB (1 mJ/cm2) and
immediately after that were treated with DMSO, silibinin
(100 μM), silibinin (100 μM) + pifithrin-α (7 μM) or
pifithrin-α (7 μM). Control plates received the same
treatments but sham UVB irradiated. Cells were incubated
for 24 hrs, then were harvested by trypsinization, stained

for the human NER factors (XPA, XPB, XPC, XPG,
DDB1 and DDB2), p53 and GADD45α were measured
by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR using
ABI 7900HT Fast System from Life technologies (Grand
Island, NY) at the Molecular Biology Core Facility of the
University of Colorado Cancer Center. The final reaction
volume was 25 μl including 2 μl of cDNA. The standard
PCR amplification conditions were: 95°C for 10 min, then
40 cycles at 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 min, as per
vendor’s protocol. Samples were run in triplicate, and
three independent experiments were performed for every
gene of interest. The mRNA level of genes was normalized
to those of β-actin mRNA in each sample. Calculations
for determining the relative level of gene expression were
made using the ∆∆CT method of quantification as reported
by Livak et al. [42].

Southwestern slot blot
After appropriate treatments, genomic DNA was
isolated from cells by using DNeasy purification kit from
Qiagen. The DNA was denatured by incubating with
4M NaOH and 100 mM EDTA at 90°C for 10 minutes,
followed by rapid chilling on ice and adding an equal
volume of 2M ammonium acetate and transferred to
positively charged nitrocellulose membrane by vacuum
slot blotting (Bio-Dot Apparatus; Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). The membranes were baked for 30 min at 85°C,
blocked with 5% non-fat milk and incubated overnight
with HRP labeled-anti-CPD antibody, and bands detected
by chemiluminescence. Membrane was stripped and
re-probed against single-stranded DNA; IR800 fluorescent
dye-labeled second antibody was used and DNA loading
control bands were visualized in LI-COR Odyssey.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad
Prism version 5 (San Diego, CA) for Windows. Data were
analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed
by Tukey’s test as post-test and a statistically significant
difference was considered at P < 0.05.

Immunofluorescence
Expression of the NER factors and other DNA
damage repair regulators (p53, p21 and GADD45α)
was analyzed by immunofluorescence using a confocal
microscope. Briefly, NHDFs were seeded onto coverslips,
and next day, cells were treated as mentioned above.
At the end of the desired treatments, cells were washed
and fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 minutes at room
temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were treated
with methanol for 10 minutes at –20°C, then washed
again with PBS and blocked with normal goat serum
and FBS for one hr at room temperature. After this,
cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary
antibodies for p53, p21, GADD45α, XPA, XPB, XPC and
XPG. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated
with specific secondary antibody and DAPI for 60 min.
Thereafter, cells were washed in dark and coverslips were
mounted for analysis. Cell images were captured at 600x
magnification on a Nikon inverted confocal microscope
using 633/561/514/488/405 nm laser wavelengths to
detect red, yellow, green and blue emissions. Images were
processed with ImageJ software.
