ABSTRACT
Burkitt lymphoma is a fast-growing tumor derived from germinal center B cells.
It is mainly treated with aggressive chemotherapy, therefore novel therapeutic
approaches are needed due to treatment toxicity and developing resistance.
Disturbance of red-ox homeostasis has recently emerged as an efficient antitumor
strategy. Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) are thioredoxin-family antioxidant enzymes
that scavenge cellular peroxides and contribute to red-ox homeostasis. PRDXs are
robustly expressed in various malignancies and critically involved in cell proliferation,
differentiation and apoptosis. To elucidate potential role of PRDXs in lymphoma, we
studied their expression level in B cell-derived primary lymphoma cells as well as
in cell lines. We found that PRDX1 and PRDX2 are upregulated in tumor B cells as
compared with normal counterparts. Concomitant knockdown of PRDX1 and PRDX2
significantly attenuated the growth rate of lymphoma cells. Furthermore, in human
Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, we isolated dimeric 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins as targets
for SK053, a novel thiol-specific small-molecule peptidomimetic with antitumor
activity. We observed that treatment of lymphoma cells with SK053 triggers formation
of covalent PRDX dimers, accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species,
phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT and leads to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
Based on site-directed mutagenesis and modeling studies, we propose a mechanism
of SK053-mediated PRDX crosslinking, involving double thioalkylation of active site
cysteine residues. Altogether, our results suggest that peroxiredoxins are novel
therapeutic targets in Burkitt lymphoma and provide the basis for new approaches
to the treatment of this disease.

INTRODUCTION

On the other hand, PRDXs are highly expressed in
promyelocytic leukemia cells and have cytoprotective,
growth-promoting functions [18]. These findings
highlight growing demand for small molecules targeting
TRX-like enzymes as putative anti-tumor therapeutics.
Such an example is adenanthin, a diterpenoid plant
metabolite, which inhibits TRX-like enzymes and exerts
anti-leukemic activity [18, 19].
We have recently designed a peptidomimetic
inhibitor, SK053, aimed to bind TRX (compound 19a in
[20]). This compound inhibits the activity of TRX and
exerts cytostatic/cytotoxic effect with a clear preference
towards rapidly proliferating cells, including murine
(EMT6, Panc02, CT26) and human (Raji, Ramos, K562)
tumor cell lines. Importantly, SK053 demonstrates
antitumor activity in mice with no evidence of systemic
toxicity [20]. In BL cell line Raji, SK053 induces
endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis [21]. The
inhibitor was designed to carry two electrophilic centers.
The putative mechanism of the inhibitor binding to TRX
involves a double thioalkylation of the two catalytic
cysteine residues. In this study, using a biotin affinity
probe-labeling approach, we identified typical 2-Cys
PRDXs as targets for SK053 in human BL cell lines.

Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a relatively rare in
Western countries, yet highly aggressive germinal B
cell-derived malignancy. Intensive chemotherapy is
the mainstay of treatment, however considerable drug
toxicity prompts the need to develop novel less toxic and
efficient approaches. One of the therapeutic challenges
is extremely fast growth of BL – short doubling time
and proliferation fraction of nearly 100%. Rapidly
proliferating cells have been reported to have increased
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [1, 2], rendering
these cells reliant on specific antioxidant enzymes
[3, 4]. Several groups of enzymes account for red-ox
balance, including peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) belonging
to thioredoxin (TRX) family. Currently, little is known
about the role of PRDXs in B cell-derived malignancies.
Notably, PRDX1 expression was seen increased upon B
cell activation and was high in lymphomas [5].
PRDXs are enzymes that utilize conserved Cys
residues to catalyze peroxides reduction. In mammals, there
are six PRDXs, classified depending on the number and
localization of the catalytic Cys residues into 3 subtypes:
typical 2-Cys (PRDX1–4), atypical 2-Cys (PRDX5), and
1-Cys (PRDX6) peroxiredoxins. For all subtypes, there
are two steps in peroxide reduction. Firstly, the thiol of
peroxidatic Cys attacks the peroxide oxygen and becomes
oxidized to sulfenic acid. Secondly, the sulfenic acid is
attacked by a resolving Cys thiol, and a disulfide bond is
formed. In typical 2-Cys PRDXs, which are head-to-tail
functional homodimers, the resolving Cys comes from
the C-terminus of the other monomer. Atypical 2-Cys and
1-Cys PRDXs, with resolving Cys in the same subunit or
coming from other proteins or peptides, respectively, are
functional monomers. Finally, to complete the catalytic
cycle, the disulfide bond formed in the PRDX active site is
reduced by the TRX-TRXR-NADPH system [6, 7].
Hydrogen peroxide works as a second messenger;
therefore, its generation and removal are strictly regulated.
Although other groups of enzymes such as catalases and
glutathione peroxidases also scavenge hydrogen peroxide,
PRDXs are crucial antioxidants due to their abundance and
prevalence in various cellular compartments. PRDXs also
directly interact with a variety of key signaling proteins,
such as MAPKs [8], c-ABL [9], c-MYC [10], or tyrosine
phosphatase PTEN [11]. They protect redox-sensitive
catalytic cysteine residues of phosphatases and suppress
MAPK signaling and senescence [12].
The expression levels of PRDXs have been
studied in a number of malignancies. For example, in
lung [13], ovarian [14], and colorectal [15] cancers,
high PRDX1 levels predict worse response to therapy.
Yet, in a subtype of breast cancer PRDX1 is a biomarker
of favorable prognosis [16]. Correspondingly, at the
early stages of leukemogenesis, PRDX2 inhibits the
proliferation of hematopoietic precursor cells [17].

RESULTS
TRX-like antioxidant enzymes are upregulated
in B cell-derived lymphoma primary cells and
cell lines
To gain deeper insight into the PRDX-TRXTRXR antioxidant system in B cell malignancies,
we analyzed the deposited microarray data [22] on
the expression of PRDX1–4, TRX1, and TRXR1.
The data contained malignant B cells derived from
BL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)
patients and normal B cell subsets. We observed
upregulated expression of PRDX1, PRDX2, and TRX1
in malignant cells. PRDX2 expression was extremely
high in BL (Figure 1A, Supplementary Tables S1
and S2). Considering that TRX1 is already a known
therapeutic target in lymphoma [23], we focused on
two PRDX cytoplasmic isoforms, PRDX1 and PRDX2.
Immunohistochemistry of primary BL revealed robust
membrane and cytoplasmic staining for both PRDX1
and PRDX2 (Figure 1B). To extend these observations,
we analyzed the expression of PRDX1 and PRDX2 in a
panel of B cell-derived tumor cell lines. In the majority
of cell lines, both PRDX1 and PRDX2 were highly
expressed, as compared with normal B cells (Figure 1C,
1D Supplementary Figure S1). Altogether, the above
results demonstrate increased expression of TRX-like
antioxidant enzymes in lymphoma cell lines as well as
in primary cells from lymphoma patients.

Downregulation of PRDX1 and 2 decreases the
proliferation and survival of lymphoma cells

first addition reaction, and the modification of 466 Da,
which corresponds to the part of SK053 after the addition
and elimination of the leaving group, according to the
previously described mechanism (Scheme 3 in [20]). We
found the tryptic peptide, containing Cys173, with a mass
modification of 466 Da. The fragmentation of the peptide
confirmed that the modification is on Cys173 (Figure 3D).
Immunoblotting revealed that PRDX1, but neither TRX1
nor TRXR1, is present in the beads eluates from cells
treated with SK-bio (Figure 3E, Supplementary Figure
S5). All of the above results demonstrate that SK053
covalently binds to PRDX1 in Raji cells.

Next, we studied the effects of PRDX1
downregulation on the growth rate and survival of BL Raji
cells which express PRDX2, and of a Raji subline, (Rajisub) [24], which we identified not to express PRDX2.
In Raji-sub cells, partial reduction of the PRDX1 level
(shRNA1) slightly reduced the growth rate, while more
pronounced inhibition of PRDX1 expression (shRNA2)
resulted in a significant inhibition of cell growth (Figure
2A) and the induction of apoptosis, as measured by
PARP cleavage (Figure 2B). In Raji cells the silencing
of a single PRDX1 or PRDX2 gene slightly diminished
cell proliferation. However, the effects of concomitant
PRDX1 and PRDX2 knockdown resulted in ERK1/2
phosphorylation, an increase in p21, and the induction of
apoptosis (Figure 2C, 2D). Moreover, in Raji cells with
a reduced PRDX1 level, we observed decreased DNA
synthesis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest (Figure 2D). In
Namalwa, another BL cell line, PRDX1, but not PRDX2,
knockdown alone already significantly reduced cell
growth rate. Importantly, the growth was further blunted in
cells with simultaneous PRDX1 and PRDX2 knockdown.
As in Raji cells, PRDX1 downregulation reduced the rate
of DNA synthesis (Supplementary Figure S2). Altogether,
these results demonstrate that concomitant PRDX1 and
PRDX2 knockdown significantly attenuates growth rate
of BL cells.

SK053 crosslinks typical 2-Cys PRDXs dimers
Next, we monitored the levels of PRDX1 in Raji
cells after SK-bio treatment. As shown in Figure 4A, we
observed a time-dependent accumulation of the additional
protein band recognized with anti-PRDX1 antibody, with
a mass corresponding to PRDX1 dimer. The band was also
observed in cells treated with unlabeled SK053 (Figure
4B). As the protein lysates were resolved under denaturing
and reducing conditions, the above results suggest that
the higher-molecular weight band is covalent and not
disulfide-linked. To further expand on this observation, we
tested the levels of monomers and dimers of all six PRDXs
in Raji and Ramos cells that were treated with SK053. As
presented in Figure 4C, the dimers could only be detected
for PRDX1–4, which are functional dimers. Treatment
with other thiol-reactive compounds, adenanthin and
AW464, did not trigger dimer formation, suggesting that it
is a unique feature of SK053 (Supplementary Figure S6).

PRDX1 is a target for SK053
Considering the elevated levels of TRX-like
enzymes as well as their pro-survival role in lymphoma
cells, we searched for candidate compounds for their
pharmacologic inhibition. We have previously reported
on the synthesis of the thiol-specific small molecule
peptidomimetic with antitumor activity, SK053. Here,
we have found that BL cell lines are sensitive to SK053,
with an LC50 ranging from 7 μM for the Namalwa up to
almost 20 μM for Bjab cells. Importantly, normal germinal
center B cells (GC B cells) isolated from human tonsils
were more resistant to SK053 (LC50 > 60 μM), indicating
selectivity towards malignant B cells (Figure 3A).
To identify targets for SK053 in BL cells, we
synthesized biotin-tagged derivative of SK053 (SKbio) and an inactive, biotinylated analogue that lacks
the electrophilic double bond (SK-in), which was used
as a negative control (Figure 3B, Supplementary Figure
S3). Only the active, SK-bio preserved cytostatic/
cytotoxic activity (Supplementary Figure S4). A band of
approximately 20 kDa was detected in a silver-stained
gel only for cells incubated with active SK-bio (Figure
3C). The protein was identified by MS as PRDX1, with >
90% of sequence coverage. Furthermore, in a collection
of tryptic peptides, we searched for a modification of
540 Da, corresponding to the mass of SK053, after the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

SK053 crosslinks PRDX1 dimers via active site
cysteine residues
The above results imply that SK053 binds to
PRDX1–4 in lymphoma cells. In agreement, SK053
inhibited PRDX1 activity and SK-bio bound recombinant
human PRDX1 monomer and triggered dimer formation,
however less efficiently than in cells (Supplementary
Figure S7). To gain more insight into the binding of SK053
to PRDX1, we docked SK053 to the PRDX1 model.
During the catalytic cycle, the regions bearing active
site Cys residues undergo substantial conformational
rearrangements ([25, 26], Supplementary Figure S8A).
Assuming that SK053 covalently binds to PRDX1 thiols,
we first docked the inhibitor to the reduced PRDX1 variant
[25]. However, in this conformation, the active site Cys
residues are not easily accessible to the bulky inhibitor
(data not shown). In contrast, the inhibitor fits well into
the oxidized form [27]. The inhibitor docked with the
best scores in the shallower pocket in the region around
the resolving Cys173 (Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure
S8B).
Considering the accumulation of covalent PRDX1
dimers upon SK053 in lymphoma cells, we speculated

both binding sites of SK053. To test this hypothesis, we

that increased ROS due to PRDXs downregulation induced
cell cycle arrest [29, 30]. Accordingly, SK053 significantly
reduced DNA synthesis (Figure 6C) and triggered cell
cycle arrest (Figure 6D). In addition, SK053 induced
apoptosis, as evidenced by the occurrence of cleaved
caspase-3 and PARP (Figure 6E) and the increase in the
numbers of early and late apoptotic cells (Figure 6F).
Pretreatment with pyruvate or ERK1/2 phosphorylation
inhibitor, U0126, attenuated SK053-induced apoptosis
(Figure 6F–6H). Taken together, these results demonstrate
that SK053 inhibits cell proliferation, and, at higher doses,
triggers apoptosis. Moreover, SK053-induced cell death
is, at least to some extent, triggered by ERK1/2 signaling.

SK053 triggers ROS accumulation, growth
arrest and apoptosis
As SK053 inhibits PRDX1 catalytic activity, we next
investigated the effects of SK053 on ROS homeostasis. As
shown in Figure 6A and Supplementary Figure S9, SK053
increased the levels of ROS in Raji cells in a time- and
dose- dependent manner. Importantly, the accumulation
of ROS was attenuated in cells that were pre-treated with
pyruvate, a non-enzymatic hydrogen peroxide scavenger
[28], as well as with catalase, an enzyme specifically
removing hydrogen peroxide (Figure 6A). These data
imply that hydrogen peroxide is a dominant ROS
accumulated in cells incubated with SK053.
It is established that hydrogen peroxide induces
phosphorylation of kinases, such as ERK1/2 and AKT
[11, 12]. Indeed, in our study, treatment of Raji cells
with SK053 triggered prolonged ERK1/2 and AKT
phosphorylation (Figure 6B). It was previously reported

DISCUSSION
In this work, we identify PRDXs as a new, attractive
therapeutic targets in BL. Particularly, we show that
PRDX1 and PRDX2 are abundantly expressed in B
cell-derived primary lymphoma cells and cell lines as
well as that they promote lymphoma cell proliferation
and survival. Moreover, we identify 2-Cys PRDXs as
molecular targets for a new thiol-targeting compound,

Indeed, SK053 binds to recombinant human PRDX1 and
inhibits its activity in an in vitro assay (Supplementary
Figure S7). Consistently, in Raji cells SK053 triggers ROS
accumulation, ERK1/2 and AKT phosphorylation, kinase
signaling that is typically induced in response to hydrogen
peroxide (Figure 6A, 6B Supplementary Figure S9). At
a lower concentration (5 μM), SK053 causes reversible
inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell cycle arrest (Figure 6C,
6D). At concentrations above 10 μM, SK053 abrogates DNA
synthesis and triggers apoptosis (Figure 6E, 6F). Interestingly,
pretreatment with the inhibitor of ERK1/2 activator, U0126,
blocks the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and attenuates SK053induced apoptosis, implicating a role for ERK1/2 signaling
in SK053-induced lymphoma cell death (Figure 6G, 6H).
Canonically, Ras-Raf-MEK1-ERK1/2 signaling stimulates
tumor cell proliferation; however, it may also mediate cell
death, including oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [34].
SK053, unlike other thiol-reactive inhibitors
adenanthin and AW464, triggers crosslinking of PRDX1–4
dimers (Supplementary Figure S6). Our studies with V5tagged PRDX1 revealed that the thioalkylation reaction
involves catalytic cysteines (Figure 5). Indeed, these
residues approach one another to form a disulfide bond
in the course of catalysis. During the catalytic cycle,
peroxiredoxins undergo substantial conformational
rearrangements, particularly within the loop bearing
resolving Cys (Supplementary Figure S8A). Our attempts
to dock SK053 to the rat PRDX1 imply that the first
thioalkylation occurs at the resolving Cys173. Intact
SK053 fits better in the shallower pocket around Cys173.
In the model with SK053 docking to the PRDX1 dimer,
the unsaturated carbon localizes at a distance of 3 Å from
the Cys173 sulfur. In addition, the aromatic acyloxy group
is placed in a positively charged environment, which
can support its dissociation and formation of the second
electrophilic center (Figure 5A). Accordingly, MS analysis
of tryptic peptides derived from the biotin affinity purified
PRDX1 revealed the modification of the resolving Cys by
the mass of 466 Da, which corresponds to the inhibitor
part after the elimination of the acyloxy group (Figure
3C). It is not entirely clear how the second thioalkylation
occurs. In lymphoma cells, the crosslinked dimers are
barely detectable after 2 h of incubation with SK053 and
they gradually accumulate over a period of at least 24 h,
showing that the process is slow in cells (Figure 4) and even
less efficient in vitro (Supplementary Figure S7B). This
may indicate that structural rearrangements, which may
also involve partner protein interactions, are necessary for
the second thioalkylation step. This is plausible, especially
considering increased oxidative stress in cells treated with
SK053. Structural studies have revealed that oxidation of
peroxidatic Cys triggers local unfolding and major structural
rearrangements of the regions around catalytic cysteines
[25]. All these results demonstrate that double thioalkylation
of catalytic cysteines is a novel strategy to inhibit dimeric
PRDXs and provide a mechanistic basis for the design of a
new class of dimeric 2-Cys PRDXs inhibitors.

strategy to inhibit dimeric PRDXs and may guide the
design of a new class of anti-lymphoma therapeutics.
Peroxiredoxins have been studied in different
tumors; however, their roles vary [8, 17]. Interestingly,
downregulation of TRX inhibitory protein VDUP1, and
upregulation of PRDX3 and PRDX4, correlated with poor
prognosis of DLBCL patients, indicating tumor-promoting
role of TRX-like enzymes in lymphomas [31]. Our results
support this finding. Specifically, we demonstrate that
PRDXs are highly expressed in human tumor B cellderived primary lymphoma cells and cell lines (Figure 1,
Supplementary Figure S1, Supplementary Tables S1 and
S2). Furthermore, in a model of BL cell lines, we show
that concomitant downregulation of PRDX1 and PRDX2
diminishes the growth rate of lymphoma cells (Figure
2, Supplementary Figure S2). These observations are in
agreement with previously published data that PRDX
knockdown decreases cell proliferation and triggers cell
cycle arrest and senescence in murine embryonic cells as
well as in human glioma cells [29, 30, 32]. All of these
findings provide a new information that, in BL cells, both
PRDX1 and PRDX2 promote cell growth and proliferation,
with a functional overlap between these two enzymes.
Lymphoma cells are characterized by a rapid
proliferation rate and increased levels of ROS, therefore they
require strict control of red-ox homeostasis [1]. Dozens of
enzymes account for red-ox homeostasis, and some of them
are redundant. Recent studies revealed that deletion of one
antioxidant enzyme triggers compensatory upregulation of
the other and that inhibition of both glutathione and TRXbased antioxidant systems synergistically kills cancer cells
[4]. Here we present that the small-molecule inhibitor,
SK053, which was previously shown to inhibit TRX-TRXR
system, has broader specificity towards other TRX-like
proteins. Using the biotin affinity labeling approach, we
identified dimeric 2-Cys PRDXs as targets for SK053 (Figure
3). We did not succeed to isolate TRX1 and TRXR1 by biotin
affinity labeling as covalent SK053 targets (Supplementary
Figure S5). Possibly, their binding may not be preserved
during the isolation and separation of biotinylated
proteins. Indeed, using a different procedure, involving
the incubation of SK-bio with Raji cell lysates, we could
isolate both TRX1 and TRXR1 as SK-bio-binding proteins
(Supplementary Figure S10); however, we consider the latter
approach less physiologically relevant. The affinity labeling
has proven effective for a small-molecule target identification
in multiple instances [18, 33]; nevertheless, it has some
limitations. Therefore, we present evidence from additional
experiments confirming that dimeric 2-Cys PRDXs are
SK053 targets in lymphoma cells. Foremost, only PRDX14, which are functional dimers, undergo dimer crosslinking
upon treatment with SK053. The dimer formation is dosedependent and proceeds in the time during incubation with
SK053, suggesting that the inhibitor is preserved for up to
24 h in cells (Figure 4A). Moreover, we show that double
thioalkylation occurs at the active site Cys residues (Figure
5), implying that SK053 blocks PRDX enzymatic activity.

In summary, we present that lymphoma cells
abundantly express TRX-like antioxidant proteins.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that peptidomimetic smallmolecule SK053 covalently binds dimeric 2-Cys PRDXs
in human BL cell lines. Importantly, our findings indicate
that PRDX1 and PRDX2 have complementary growthsupporting functions in a BL model in vitro. Based on these
findings, we conclude that targeting TRX-like antioxidant
proteins may be considered a promising approach to
therapy of BL. At the same time, our results suggest that
targeting a single PRDX may be insufficient in this disease
and pinpoint the need for the development of pan-PRDX
inhibitors with a prospective therapeutic use.

(GC B cells) were separated by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting using FACSAria III.
For co-culture experiments, HT-1080 cells
expressing human CD40L were incubated with mitomycin
C (10 μg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) for 3 h, and seeded into 96well plates, 1 × 104 cells per well. Next day, when HT1080 cells were attached, the medium was removed and
GC B cells were added, 1 × 105 cells per well, in RPMI full
medium supplemented with 25 ng/ml IL-21 (Peprotech).
To assess SK053 cytostatic/cytotoxic effects, cells in coculture were incubated with SK053 in a concentration
range 5–80 μM for 48 h. The numbers of viable cells
were assessed with Muse™ Cell Analyzer, using Count
&Viability Reagent (Merck Millipore). The LC50 was
calculated in Graphpad Prism 5 by nonlinear regression
dose-response analysis with variable slopes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals

Affinity isolation of biotinylated proteins

SK053 was synthesized as described in [20], AW464
(7a) as described in [35]. The synthesis of biotinylated
SK053 analogue (SK-bio) and its inactive counterpart
(SK-in) is described in the Supplementary Methods.
Adenanthin was purchased from Faces Biochemical Co.,
Wuhan, China and U0126 from Selleckchem, USA.

Raji-sub or Raji cells were cultured in a serumfree RPMI medium in the presence of 100 μM SK-bio or
SK-in, with 2 × 107 cells in each group. After two hours,
the cells were harvested, lysed, and biotinylated proteins
were isolated as described in [19]. The protein band that
migrated around 20 kDa was excised from the gel and
analyzed by MS. Alternatively, the eluates were subjected
to immunoblotting.

Cell culture
Human BL cell lines (RAJI, Ramos, BJAB, Daudi,
and Namalwa), B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(Mec-1), DLBCL (DHL-4, DHL-6, Ly4, Ly7, Ly10, Ly1,
and U2932) and human embryonic kidney (HEK293T)
cells were purchased from ATCC. The Raji-sub cell line
is a complement-sensitive sub-strain of Raji [24]. The
authentication of the Raji-sub cell line was confirmed by
genotyping (IdentiCell, Denmark). Cells were cultured
in DMEM (HEK293T) or RPMI-1640 medium (all
other cell lines) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum and antibiotic at 37°C, 5% CO2, in a
humidified atmosphere. In all experiments, control groups
were treated with vehicle (DMSO).

Mass spectrometry
LC-MS analysis of gel slices was conducted as
described in [36]. The raw data were pre-processed with
Mascot Distiller software (v. 2.3, Matrix Science) and
obtained peak lists were searched against the database
of human protein sequences from SwissProt combined
with its randomized version (40464 sequences) using
Mascot search engine (version 2.4, 8-processors onsite
license) (Matrix Science) with the following search
parameters: enzyme specificity – semi-trypsin, missed
cleavages – 1, variable modifications – oxidation (M),
carbamidomethylation (CK), SK053(C), peptide mass
tolerance – ± 20 ppm, fragment mass tolerance – ± 0.6
Da. Decoy option in Mascot was activated in order
to assure the false discovery rate below 1%, and the
resulting Mascot score threshold of 63 was applied to
results.

Isolation and culture of germinal center B cells
Human tonsils were derived from children
undergoing tonsillectomy (n = 3). Their use was approved
by the Ethics Committee at the Institute of Physiology
and Pathology of Hearing, Warsaw, Poland. After
resection, tonsils were cut into small pieces and incubated
in the RPMI medium supplemented with collagenase
and DNase for 30 min at 37°C with gentle shaking and
filtered through 70 μm cell strainer. After washing in
PBS, mononuclear cells were isolated with Histopaque
1077 density gradient and subjected to CD19 negative
selection using EasySep™ Human B Cell Enrichment
Kit (STEMCELL Technologies). The isolated B cells
were stained with anti-CD20-PE and anti-CD38-FITC
antibodies and CD20+/CD38+ germinal center B cells

MTT assay
Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of
2 × 104 per well and treated with investigated compounds
in a final volume of 200 μl. After 48 hours, MTT assay
was performed as described in [21].

ROS assessment
Cells were loaded with CM-H2-DCFDA (Molecular
Probes, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol, using

1 μM dye concentration for 30 min at 37 °C. Next, labeled
cells were incubated with SK053 or H2O2 in a culture
medium at 37 °C, washed in PBS and the intensity of
green fluorescence was analyzed in BD Accuri C6 Flow
Cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA).

The RNA extraction, cDNA isolation and RT-PCR
assay was performed as previously described [16].

Apoptosis was evaluated using Annexin V
Apoptosis detection kit (eBioscience, USA), according to
manufacturer’s protocol.

Modeling and ligand docking
PRDX1 models with point mutations were prepared
based on homology modeling procedures, using Modeller
[37] and evaluated with MetaMQAP [38] and PROQ
[39]. Protein structures superpositions were prepared
with Swiss-PDBViewer [40]. Figures were prepared with
PyMOL 1.5 (Schrödinger). For docking procedures we
selected crystal structures-derived models (PDB codes
1QQ2 and 2Z9S) and corresponding models with point
mutations, with all rat-specific residues substituted with
human equivalents. Docking simulations were carried
out with Surflex-Dock 2.6 software [41] based on the
“anchor-and-grow” algorithm for optimized structures
of small molecules. We used elNémo web server [42] to
calculate proteins normal modes. Files with coordinates
are available in Supplementary Data.

Site-directed mutagenesis
The cysteine-to-alanine mutations were introduced
to pLenti6/V5-DEST-PRDX1 using QuikChange XL SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies, USA)
according to manufacturer’s instruction. The primers are
provided in Supplementary Table S3. Mutations were
confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Lymph nodes from 4 patients with reactive follicular
hyperplasia and tissue sections from gastric mucosa and
tumors of the thigh, neck and thyroid gland from 4 patients
with BL were evaluated. All individuals gave informed
consent and the study was approved by the Institute of
Hematology and Transfusion Medicine Ethics Committee.
Tissue biopsies of the patients were histopathologically
examined to establish a diagnosis according to 2008 WHO
classification. Tissue biopsies were fixed in 10% formalin,
routinely processed and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the
following antibodies: PRDX1 (Sigma-Aldrich, dilution
1:150, pH = 9.0) and PRDX2 (GeneTex, clone EPR5154,
dilution 1:200, pH = 9.0). Staining was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
EnVision System (Dako) was used for detection. Positive
controls included human tonsils (PRDX1) and human
prostatic hyperplasia (PRDX2). The negative (isotype)
controls were generated with ready to use FLEX Negative
Control Mouse (cocktail of mouse IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b,
IgG3 and IgM; code No IR750; Dako). Samples were
reviewed for the expression of lymphoid cells by MPS.
Appropriate cellular localization for immunostaining was
membrane and cytoplasmic for PRDX1 and PRDX2.
All photographs were taken using DP72 Olympus BX63
microscope camera (Olympus, Japan).

DNA synthesis
To evaluate the rate of DNA synthesis, for the last
hour of incubation with SK053, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine
(EdU) was added to a final concentration of 50 μM. Next,
cells were fixed, permeabilized and labeled according to
Click-iT® EdU Alexa Fluor® 488 Imaging Kit protocol
(Life Technologies, USA) and the number of EdU-positive
cells was assessed by flow cytometry.

Cell cycle
Cells treated with SK053 were washed with PBS
and fixed in 70% ethanol at -20 °C overnight. Next, cells
were washed twice with PBS, and incubated in propidium
iodide (50 μg/ml) containing 200 μg/ml RNase A at
37 °C for 30 min. DNA content was analyzed by flow
cytometry and FlowJo software. Cell cycle distribution
was determined from 104 cells using Watson mathematical
model with constraints set on the vehicle control (DMSO).
The obtained results were further normalized using below
formula so percentages of cells in each phase add up to
100%: normalized proportion of a phase= (proportion of a
phase/sum of all proportions) x 100%.

Gene expression analysis
To examine expression levels of the genes involved
in the red-ox pathway in the selected populations of B cells
we accessed the E-GEOD-12453 data set [22] deposited
in the ArrayExpress database [43]. Briefly, the raw (CEL)
data was normalized using the robust multiarray average
(RMA) procedure using a custom CDF environment
[44] in order to collapse the features to the Entrez gene
level. The normalized data was then mean-centered and
scaled. The significance for each gene to differentiate the
respective B cell classes was computed using analysis of
variance and the differences in expression between the
normal B cells and DLBCL and BL samples, respectively,
was done using the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test.
All of the statistical procedures were done in R.
