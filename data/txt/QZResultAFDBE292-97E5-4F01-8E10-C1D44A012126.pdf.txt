Abstract
Recent clinical trials indicate that synthetic progestins may
stimulate progression of breast cancer in postmenopausal
women, a result that is consistent with studies in chemicallyinduced breast cancer models in rodents. However, progestindependent progression of breast cancer tumor xenografts has
not been shown. This study shows that xenografts obtained
from BT-474 and T47-D human breast cancer cells without
Matrigel in estrogen-supplemented nude mice begin to
regress within days after tumor cell inoculation. However,
their growth is resumed if animals are supplemented with
progesterone. The antiprogestin RU-486 blocks progestin
stimulation of growth, indicating involvement of progesterone
receptors. Exposure of xenografts to medroxyprogesterone
acetate, a synthetic progestin used in postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy and oral contraception, also stimulates growth of regressing xenograft tumors. Tumor
progression is dependent on expression of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF); growth of progestin-dependent tumors
is blocked by inhibiting synthesis of VEGF or VEGF activity
using a monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody (2C3) or by treatment
with PRIMA-1, a small-molecule compound that reactivates
mutant p53 into a functional protein and blocks VEGF
production. These results suggest a possible model system for
screening potential therapeutic agents for their ability to
prevent or inhibit progestin-dependent human breast tumors.
Such a model could potentially be used to screen for safer
antiprogestins, antiangiogenic agents, or for compounds that
reactivate mutant p53 and prevent progestin-dependent
progression of breast disease. [Cancer Res 2007;67(20):9929–36]

Introduction
The role of natural and synthetic progestins in the proliferation
of breast tumor cells is controversial (1, 2). Initial studies suggested
that progestins have antiproliferative effects in breast cancer (3).
However, those results contradict recent in vivo and in vitro studies
suggesting that progestins stimulate proliferation of normal and
neoplastic breast cells in various species (4–7). It is likely that the
growth-stimulating effects of exogenous progestins are mediated
by the progesterone receptor (PR), which is required for growth
of rodent mammary gland and 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene
(DMBA)-induced tumors (7, 8). Several human clinical trials show

that the risk of breast cancer is higher in women on combined
estrogen-progestin hormone replacement therapy (HRT) than in
women on HRT that only contains estrogen (9–11). These results
have stimulated additional research into the mechanism by which
progestins might stimulate growth of human breast tumors. However, the mechanistic basis of this effect has not yet been resolved,
at least in part because there are few relevant animal models
suitable for addressing this question. Furthermore, the studies
conducted in model systems to date, mostly in rodents, have
yielded conflicting results (1–3). Consequently, there is an urgent
need for an improved animal model involving human breast cancer cells for studying progestin-dependent proliferation of human
tumor cells.
This study proposes a human-mouse hybrid model system based
on progestin-dependent growth of human tumor xenografts in
nude mice. This model uses human T47-D and BT-474 breast cancer cells, which express PR and mutant p53, to generate xenograft
tumors in nude mice supplemented with exogenous hormones.
Tumor cells in most models are coinjected with Matrigel and
require exogenous estrogen for optimal growth. However, in this
model, tumor cells are injected in the absence of Matrigel but in
the presence of exogenous estrogen, and these tumors rapidly
regress after initial growth. They regain the capacity to proliferate
in the presence of exogenous progestin that can be blocked by
inclusion of the antiprogestin RU-486. We have previously shown
that progestins induce the vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) in breast cancer cells that contain progesterone receptor
and mutant p53 protein but not in cells that contain the wild-type
p53 protein (12, 13). This model can be used to test the efficacy of
antitumor therapeutic agents in blocking progression of progestindependent breast tumors. A proof-of-principle experiment conducted here yielded positive results: RU-486, an anti-VEGF antibody
(2C3), or PRIMA-1 (p53-dependent reactivation and induction of
massive apoptosis), a small-molecular-weight compound that
reactivates mutant p53 protein into an active protein (14) and
blocks the production of progestin-induced VEGF (12), prevented progestin-stimulated growth of the xenograft tumors.
Thus, this study provides evidence that the xenograft tumor model
described here is suitable for testing antiprogestins or antiangiogenic compounds for their ability to block progression of hormonedependent human breast cancer.

100  20-mm tissue culture dishes. Cells were harvested using 0.05% trypsinEDTA (Invitrogen Corporation and Life Technologies).
Reagents. Sixty-day release pellets containing 17-h-estradiol (1.7 mg),
progesterone (10 mg), medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 10 mg), mifepristone (RU486; 25 mg), and placebo pellets were from Innovative Research
of America. Anti-VEGF antibody 2C3 that prevents binding of VEGF to
VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2, KDR/flk-1) was raised against recombinant human VEGF as described previously (15). C44, a mouse isotypematched control monoclonal antibody specific for colchicine was from
ATCC. PRIMA-1 (p53-reactivation and induction of massive apoptosis) was
from Tocris.
Progestin-dependent growth of human breast xenograft tumors.
Female athymic nu/nu nude mice, 5 to 6 weeks old (18–22 g), were
purchased from Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc. Mice were housed in a laminar
air-flow cabinet under specific pathogen-free conditions. All facilities were
approved by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care in accordance with the current federal regulations and
standards. Nude mice were inoculated with 17-h-estradiol pellets 24 to
48 h before implantation of BT-474 or T47-D cells. Cells were harvested by
trypsinization and washed twice with DMEM/F12 medium, and cell pellets
were resuspended (1  107 cells in 0.15 mL) in DMEM/F12 medium and
injected (s.c.) into the left and right flanks of each mouse. Tumor volume
was measured every 3 days using a digital caliper and calculated using the
formula (L  W  H)  p/6 as previously described (16). Tumors began to
regress after reaching 60 to 100 mm3 in size (f6–10 days). When tumor
volume had decreased 50%, mice were inoculated with a progesterone or
MPA pellet. When desired, progesterone or MPA pellets were removed
under anesthesia after tumor volume was restored or nearly restored to
pre-regression size.
Inhibition of progestin-dependent breast tumor growth. Tumorbearing mice, whose tumors had undergone regression as described above,
were inoculated with progestin pellets and assigned to four groups of six
mice each: control (placebo), progestin alone, progestin + anti-VEGF 2C3,
and progestin + control antibody C44. Treatment with either 2C3 or C44
antibodies (100 Ag/mouse, ip) or 0.2 mL PBS was thrice a week. Tumors
were measured every 3 days with a digital caliper, and tumor volumes were
calculated using the formula (L  W  H)  p/6 (ref. 16). At the end of the
treatment or experiment, animals were sacrificed, and tumors were
harvested and weighed. Fresh tumor tissue was immediately placed in 4%
paraformaldehyde for immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) or frozen in
liquid nitrogen for future analysis.
PRIMA-1 treatment followed the same procedure, except that tumorbearing mice were treated with 50 mg/kg PRIMA-1 via tail vein injection for
the indicated number of days (see figure legends; ref. 14). Tumor tissue was
excised and analyzed by IHC as described below.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis was
carried out for VEGF, factor VIII, ERa, and PR. Tumor tissue was fixed
overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by paraffin infiltration and
embedding. Sections of 5 Am were mounted onto ProbeOn Plus microscope
slides (Fisher Scientific Inc.), stained with H&E, and examined for cellularity
by light microscopy. For immunohistochemical analysis, sections were
dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated through graded concentrations of ethanol,
rinsed in distilled water, and, if necessary, stored in PBS at 4jC until use.
Sections were subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval in 10 mmol/L
citrate buffer (pH, 6.0; VEGF, ERa, PR) or proteinase K [20 Ag/mL in TE
buffer (pH 8.0); factor VIII antigen]. Slides were treated with 3% hydrogen
peroxide in absolute methanol (to inactivate endogenous peroxidase
activity), washed in 3 PBS, incubated in blocking buffer with 5% bovine
serum albumin for 20 min, and treated with polyclonal antibody at room
temperature for 60 min. Antibodies and dilutions were as follows:
anti-VEGF antibody [1:200 dilution of a rabbit anti-VEGF polyclonal
antibody (sc-152)]; anti-ERa [1:300 dilution of a rabbit anti-ERa polyclonal
antibody (sc-542); Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.]; anti-PR [1:50 dilution of
a rabbit anti-PR polyclonal antibody (A0098)]; and anti–factor VIII antibody
[1:400 dilution of a rabbit anti–factor VIII polyclonal antibody (A0082);
DAKO]. Sections were washed and sequentially incubated with secondary
antibody (biotinylated swine anti-mouse IgG or biotinylated swine anti-

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

rabbit IgG; DAKO) and streptavidin-linked horseradish peroxidase product (DAKO) for 30 min, also at room temperature. Alternatively,
some sections were incubated with EnVision+, a horseradish peroxidase–
labeled polymer conjugated with anti-rabbit antibodies (DAKO). Bound
antibodies were visualized with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
(0.05% with 0.015% H2O2 in PBS; DAKO). Sections were counterstained
with Mayer’s hematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared, and coverslipped for microscopic examination.
Vessel density. For blood vessel enumeration, sections from two to four
tumors from each treatment group were labeled with anti–factor VIII and
examined at 100 magnification. Total number of vessels were counted in
each of the two to three fields (each field represents f4,000 Am2). Vessel
counts are expressed as vessel density per square millimeter.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was tested using one-way
ANOVA or t test with repeated measure over time. The assumption of
ANOVA was examined and nonparametric measure based on ranks was
used, as needed. Values were reported as mean F SE. When ANOVA
indicated significant effect (F ratio, P < 0.05), the Student-Keuls multirange
test was employed to compare the means of individual groups using Sigma
Stat Software (Sigstat Software Inc.).

Results
Progesterone stimulates growth of BT-474 and T47-D
xenograft tumors in nude mice. This study exploits a model
system based on the growth properties of BT-474 and T47-D
human breast cancer cells in nude mice. These cells contain
mutant p53 protein and form xenograft tumors in estrogensupplemented nude mice when they are injected s.c. in the
presence or absence of Matrigel. The xenograft tumors grow
aggressively when coinjected in the presence of Matrigel; however,
in the absence of Matrigel, the tumors reach a volume of 50 to
100 mm3 in 6 to 10 days and then regress (Fig. 1A and B; also
ATCC data sheet). However, regressing tumors resume growth
when the host animal is treated with exogenous progesterone
(i.e., by implantation of a progesterone pellet). In this model,
chronic dosing with progesterone is required for the xenograft
tumors to continue to grow. As shown in Fig. 1A, xenografts
obtained with BT-474 regressed after 6 days following tumor cell
injection and initial growth phase. Progesterone pellets were
implanted when tumors were f50% of their initial volume (day
12), inducing tumor proliferation. Tumors did not proliferate in
animals receiving placebo. Tumors in animals exposed to
progesterone were much larger than those in controls, with
respective volumes 260% and 350% of those in placebo controls 3
and 4 weeks postprogesterone administration. To show progesterone dependence in this model, we removed the hormone pellet
on day 42, leading to a 3-fold reduction in tumor volume after
2 weeks compared with tumors exposed to progesterone throughout the same period (Fig. 1A). We next determined the ability of
progesterone to rescue xenografts obtained from T47-D cells. As
shown in Fig. 1B, T47-D xenografts were unable to sustain their
initial growth phase following implantation of an estrogen pellet
and regressed after 9 days. Tumor volume declined to 75% of the
original volume in about 20 days, at which point animals were
again exposed to progesterone and tumors grew as previously
described with BT-474 xenografts (Fig. 1B). Removal of the progesterone pellet on day 45 led to loss of tumor growth, confirming
the dependence of the T47-D xenografts on progesterone. T47-D
xenografts did not grow as aggressively as BT-474 cells.
Progesterone was unable to bring about tumor progression if
animals were pretreated with the antiprogestin RU-486, indicating
that progesterone receptors are likely required for tumor cell

proliferation (Fig. 1C). In contrast to BT-474 and T47-D cells,
tumors generated from wild-type p53 containing MCF-7 cells were
not stimulated by progesterone (data not shown). The studies
described below involve xenograft tumors generated by injecting
nude mice with highly aggressive BT-474 cells to establish this cell
line as a model that can be used to study progesterone dependent
progression of breast cancer xenografts.
Progesterone-dependent rescue of tumor growth is associated with altered expression of VEGF, ER, and PR. Because
VEGF expression is associated with tumor growth and expansion
(17, 18), we sought to determine whether VEGF expression was
altered during various phases of tumor growth following tumor cell
injection (Fig. 1A–C). BT-474 cells were injected into nude mice and
tumor xenografts collected (a) after 6 days (before tumor regression), (b) during tumor regression when tumors were f50% of
their pre-regression volume, and (c) 1 week after implantation
of progesterone pellets, when the initial signs for resumption of
tumor growth were recorded. As shown in Fig. 1D, regressing
tumors expressed lower levels of VEGF compared with tumors at
other stages of development, with the highest levels of VEGF

expressed following progesterone administration. Thus, in this
model, VEGF expression correlates with tumor growth patterns
and is most likely under progesterone regulation, as shown previously in vitro (19).
Because placement of an estrogen pellet is essential for initial
tumor uptake and subsequent tumor growth, we wondered
whether tumor cells might have lost their steroid receptors,
resulting in tumor regression. Both ER and PR were expressed
highly in tumors before regression, but their expression was
reduced during the regression phase, and levels remained low
during the progesterone-induced regrowth phase within 1 week in
which the tumor samples were analyzed.
Progesterone-dependent rescue of tumor growth requires
VEGF-VEGFR2. Previous studies showed that progesterone
stimulates secretion of VEGF by human breast cancer cells,
including BT-474 cells that contain mutant p53 protein but not by
cells that contain wild-type p53 protein (12). Secreted VEGF is
strongly proangiogenic and promotes endothelial cell survival and
proliferation and stimulation of tumor cell proliferation (13, 20).
It is therefore possible that progesterone might rescue regressing

tumors through VEGF-dependent angiogenesis. With this in
mind, we inhibited VEGF function with 2C3, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between VEGF and VEGFR2.
Figure 2A shows that 2C3 antiserum, although not control antibody (C44), prevented progesterone-dependent growth of regressing xenograft tumors. By the end of the experiment, tumor volumes
were suppressed 4-fold in 2C3 and placebo-treated animals,
compared with tumors in progesterone or C44-treated animals
(Fig. 2A). Furthermore, tumors exposed to 2C3 had reduced
vascularity and were characterized by a white appearance (Fig. 2B).
In contrast, tumors from animals treated with C44 seemed larger
and bloody. Figure 2C shows that at the end of the study, average
tumor weight from animals treated with 2C3 was significantly
lower (4–5-fold) than tumor weight from animals treated with C44
or progesterone and was not significantly different from tumor
weights observed in the control group. This result is consistent
with a specific anti-VEGF-induced inhibition of tumor growth.
Average animal body weight was unaffected in the two treatment

groups, except at late time points when tumor weight likely
contributed significantly to total body weight (Fig. 2D).
PRIMA-1 blocks progesterone-dependent tumor growth and
causes tumor regression. PRIMA-1 is a low-molecular-weight
compound that reactivates mutant p53 and inhibits progestininduced in vitro secretion of VEGF from tumor cells (14). Based on
the results shown in Fig. 2 and previously published in vitro studies
(12), it seemed possible that PRIMA-1 might also inhibit VEGF
secretion in xenograft tumors and, thus, inhibit progesteronedependent tumor growth. Figure 3A shows that PRIMA-1 treatment of animals with progesterone-rescued tumors inhibited
progesterone-dependent growth of xenograft tumors. Two weeks
after PRIMA-1 treatment, tumor volume decreased by 75% compared with animals treated with vehicle alone. In some PRIMA1–treated animals, tumors regressed completely, whereas in
other cases, PRIMA-1–treated tumors showed marked loss of
vascularity (Fig. 3B). As observed above for animals treated
with 2C3, PRIMA-1 caused significant reduction in tumor weight

A, BT-474 cells were injected, tumor growth
was monitored, and P pellets were given as
described in Fig. 1. When mean average tumor
volume reached 100 mm3, animals were
injected with 50 mg/kg PRIMA-1 twice daily for
2 wk. Animals were sacrificed and tumors

(f80%) compared with tumor weight in control animals (Fig. 3C),
without causing a decrease in total body weight or other signs of
toxicity (Fig. 3D). It is likely that both PRIMA-1 and 2C3 antibody
are antiangiogenic, preventing progesterone-stimulated secretion
of VEGF by BT-474 cells or blocking the action of secreted VEGF.
This was confirmed by estimating blood vessel density in xenograft tumors from mice treated with or without PRIMA-1 or
2C3 antiserum. The results (Fig. 4B) are consistent with the
hypothesis that PRIMA-1 and 2C3 inhibit angiogenesis in our
model system.
MPA stimulates growth of xenograft tumors in nude mice.
Recent clinical trials show that synthetic progestins could increase
the risk of breast cancer in women on HRT (9–11). Because the
progestin in most HRT protocols is MPA and because our previous
studies show that MPA induces VEGF in BT-474 breast cancer cells
in vitro (12), the effect of MPA was tested in the model system
described here. We found that MPA and progesterone had very

www.aacrjournals.org

similar effects on BT-474 xenografts (Fig. 5), a similarity that
extended to attenuation of MPA-dependent growth of xenograft
tumors by PRIMA-1 and 2C3. Tumor weights were influenced
comparably by both means of inhibition, and neither showed
animal toxicity (data not shown).

Discussion
This study describes an animal model system for studying
progestin-dependent progression of human breast cancer. The
model exploits xenograft tumors derived by injecting BT-474
and T47-D cells into estrogen-supplemented nude mice. Both
cell types express PR and mutant p53 protein, and tumor development is progesterone dependent. We mainly focused on the
development of the BT-474 cells as a suitable progestin-dependent
model in this study, and we describe experimental proof that
this system is a suitable model for the in vivo assessment of the

efficacy of agents which inhibit progestin-dependent tumor growth
or cause tumor regression. Such agents might act via multiple
direct or indirect mechanisms, including reactivation of mutant
p53, inhibition of angiogenesis, stimulation of apoptosis, and
interference with hormone-induced signaling pathways. In addition, using this model, we show that a synthetic progestin used

risk of breast cancer (9–11) can also increase VEGF and tumor
growth.
This model exploits the fact that BT-474 and T47-D cells form
transient tumors that regress spontaneously when injected into
estrogen-supplemented nude mice in the absence of Matrigel.
Furthermore, regressing tumors are rescued by chronic dosing
with natural or synthetic progesterone via a mechanism that
requires secretion of VEGF by the regressing tumor. This system
requires inoculation of estrogen-supplemented nude mice with
tumor cells in the absence of Matrigel, which would normally
be used to provide the growth and survival factors essential for
tumor cell proliferation. Previous efforts to develop such a system
may have failed because these requirements were not met or
because ovariectomized (but estrogen-supplemented) animals
were used (21). Wild-type p53 containing MCF-7 cells do not
elaborate increased VEGF levels in response to progestins in vitro
(12) and fail to show progestin-dependent tumor growth (data not
shown).
It is important to emphasize that the initial growth of tumor cells
in the xenograft models studied here are completely dependent
on estrogen. A possible explanation for estrogen dependence of
these tumors is that the steroid may be required to support
continued expression of PR (22), although we cannot exclude
additional effects of estrogen, such as stimulating the expression of
other factors required for tumor growth (23). It is interesting to note
that sections taken from tumors before regression showed high
levels of VEGF, ER, and PR compared with regressing tumors.
Because animals contain an estrogen pellet throughout the course
of the study, it would seem that estrogen-induced effects are not
sufficient to sustain growth in this model in the absence of any

Matrigel, or that tumors begin to synthesize antiangiogenesis
factors that prevent tumor progression. The reason for reduced
levels of ER and PR during the regression phase remains to be
determined, although it might be explained by the absence of
required growth factors normally present in Matrigel. Because PR is
under ER regulation (22, 24), reduced levels of PR could be due to a
loss of ER within tumor tissues. However, once progesterone pellets
are in place, tumor cells are once again able to sustain VEGF
production, thereby creating a milieu conducive to angiogenesis
and tumor expansion. Under these conditions, levels of ER and PR
remain low although not absent. Functional PR seems to be a vital
component of the growth process because RU-486 overcomes the
stimulatory effects of progestins; furthermore, it has been shown
that VEGF is under PR regulation in human breast cancer cell lines
(12, 19). We cannot, however, rule out the involvement of ER in the
regulation of VEGF in breast cancer cells, although this remains
controversial (25).
Based on a number of observations, we can conclude that VEGF
is critical for progesterone-dependent progression of xenograft
tumors: (a) tumor growth is suppressed by 2C3, an antibody that
blocks the interaction between VEGF and VEGFR2; (b) PRIMA-1
inhibits progesterone-induced secretion of VEGF and reactivates
mutant p53 (12); (c) both BT-474 and T47-D cells express VEGFR2
(13). It is likely that VEGF acts directly as an angiogenic agent in
this system, because tumors from animals treated with 2C3 or
PRIMA-1 are less vascularized than tumors from control animals.
Additional mechanisms involved in the antiangiogenic effects of
2C3 and PRIMA-1 may involve recruitment of endothelial precursor
cells or inhibition of other pathways essential for tumor growth.
Additional experiments are required to explore these possibilities.
Because levels of VEGF correlate with poor response to chemotherapy and disease-free survival rate in breast cancer patients
(26, 27), this model provides a means by which we may assess
antiangiogenic compounds such as PRIMA-1, as well as antibodybased therapies that might prevent the progression of progestindependent breast cancers.
During the conduct of the studies reported herein, we observed
that the rescue of tumor progression by progesterone depended on

the degree of regression before implantation of the progesterone
pellet. When the degree of initial regression was about 40% to 50%
of peak tumor volume, tumor growth was rapidly rescued following
re-exposure to progesterone, and large tumor masses quickly
developed (e.g., Fig. 2A). On the other hand, if the BT-474 xenografts
regressed more than 50%, a far greater period was required for
progesterone-induced rescue and a resumption of tumor growth
(e.g., Fig. 1A). Nevertheless, it is important to note that all tumors
did eventually resume their growth. A number of explanations
might account for the resumption of growth following exposure to
progesterone. The reduced number of tumor cells present following
regression would presumably require longer to produce threshold
levels of VEGF essential for triggering angiogenesis. It is also
possible that regression eliminates potential stem cells which
may be required for rapid growth following progesterone signaling. However, we cannot rule out that variations in tumor growth
might also arise as a consequence of using different batches of
cells or inherent variations in the batches of animals used. These
parameters require further study.
In the present study, we describe an animal model system which
is suitable for screening potential therapeutic agents for their
ability to prevent or arrest the growth of progestin-dependent
human breast tumors. The model is appropriate for screening antiprogestins, progestins mimetics, and antiangiogenic compounds
and will, we believe, enhance the future development of safer
progestins and their antagonists, as well as compounds capable of
activating mutant p53 and suppressing angiogenesis.
