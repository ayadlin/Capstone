ABSTRACT
Bladder cancer (BC) is a common urologic tumor characterized by high risk of
recurrence and mortality. Capsaicin (CPS), used as an intravesical drug for overactive
bladder, was demonstrated to induce cell death in different cancer cells including BC
cells.
Here we found that treatment of high-grade BC cells with high dose of CPS
triggers autophagy. Infact, the CPS treatment alters the redox homeostasis by
inducing production of radicals, mitochondrial depolarization, alterations of ADP/
ATP ratio and activation of AMPK pathway stimulating the autophagic process in
BC cells. The inhibition of autophagy, by using the specific inhibitor bafilomycin A
or Beclin 1 knock-down, enhanced the CPS-induced cell death, demonstrating that
CPS-induced autophagy acts as a pro-survival process in BC cells. By using PCR
arrays and FACS analysis, we found that the CPS-treated BC cells displayed typical
mesenchymal features of the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) as elongated
shape and over-expression of vimentin, a5 and b1 integrin subunits, integrin-like
kinase and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Moreover, we demonstrated that CPS
treatment stimulates upregulation of Dhh/Ptch2/Zeb2 members of the Hedgehog
signaling pathway, increases CD24, VEGFA and TIMP1 and decreases CD44 and ALCAM
mRNA expression levels. By PTCH2 knock-down we found that the Hedgehog signaling
pathway is involved in the CPS-induced autophagy and EMT phenotype.
Finally, we also showed that the CPS-resistant EMT-positive BC cells displayed
an increased drug-resistance to the cytotoxic effects of mitomycin C, gemcitabine and
doxorubicine drugs commonly used in BC therapy.

chemotherapy regiments, only few patients respond
to single-agent therapy. For this reason, the finding
of innovative anti-cancer combinations and new antineoplastic drugs is necessary.
Capsaicin (CPS), mainly known as food additive,
is the active alkaloid found primarily in the chili
peppers of the plant genus Capsicum, responsible for
the hot pungent taste of these fruits. CPS, its derivatives
and related compounds form a chemical group called

INTRODUCTION
Bladder cancer (BC), characterized by high risk
of recurrence and mortality, is among the fifth most
common malignancies in the world. The majority of BC
is represented by urothelial carcinoma (UC), also known
as transitional cell carcinoma (TCC), while squamous
and adenocarcinomas are diffused in a small percentage
[1]. Although BC is considered to be responsive to the

capsaicinoids, known as exciting pharmacological
agents for their ability to exert various effects on
human body and in different diseases such as obesity,
cardiovascular,
gastrointestinal,
dermatologic
conditions and neurogenic overactive bladder [2]. In
the last decades, several reports have demonstrated
that CPS treatment is able to induce both pro- and
anti-carcinogenic effects [3]. In fact, CPS inhibits
cell proliferation and induces cell death in a TRPV1dependent and independent manner in many different
malignant human cell lines [4–6], including prostate
and BC cells [7–9]; on the contrary, CPS promotes
the carcinogenesis of colon, gastric and skin cancers
stimulating cell proliferation and migration [2].
Autophagy is a self-degradative cellular mechanism
used to degrade and recycle cytoplasmic components
to provide energy during starvation, stress conditions
or growth factor withdrawal promoting cell survival;
however, excessive autophagy may also trigger
autophagic-associated cell death [10]. It has been shown
that CPS is able to stimulate autophagy in breast cancer
and osteosarcoma cell lines. The CPS-induced autophagy
is evoked at the same time with cell death and involves
the DNA repair system functioning as a pathway that
counteracts the CPS-induced apoptosis prolonging
cancer cell survival [11, 12]. Moreover, several reports
demonstrated that autophagy inhibition sensitizes BC
cells to chemotherapy, indicating that in BC, targeting
autophagy may be an effective therapeutic strategy to
overcome drug resistance [13].
Novel evidence suggests that drug resistance is
acquired by BC cells that undergo epithelial mesenchymal
transition (EMT). EMT, characterized by morphological
and molecular changes of cancer cells with increase of
mesenchymal-related proteins, plays a pivotal role in
the acquisition of malignant features such as invasion,
metastasis and chemoresistance [14, 15]. In this regard,
CPS induces EMT in colon cancer cells by modulating the
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the AKT/
mTOR pathways [16].
In BC, the tumorigenicity and EMT process are
regulated through constitutive activation of different
members of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway [17,
18]. Three Hh genes have been described in mammals:
Sonic (SHH), Indian (IHH) and Desert (DHH). The Hh
proteins are ligands for the patched receptor (Ptch), which
negatively regulates smoothened protein (Smo). The Ptch
binds to the Hh proteins, resulting in Ptch internalization
in endosomes and lifting Ptch-mediated repression. Two
homologous Ptch receptors, Ptch1 and Ptch2, have been
described, both of which are able to interact with the Hh
ligands [19].
Herein, the ability of CPS to induce autophagic
cell survival, EMT and chemoresistance by involving the
Hedgehog pathway was investigated in BC cell lines.

CPS induces autophagy in BC cells
The activation of autophagy in CPS (300 μM)treated BC cells was evaluated by assessing the
processing of LC3 protein by western blot analysis. To
this purpose, 5637 and T24 cancer cells, treated or not
with CPS for different times, were analyzed for LC3
mobility. A significant accumulation of LC3-II proteins,
starting at 12 h after treatment and sustained until 72 h
was observed in both CPS-treated BC cell lines (Figure
1A). Similar results were obtained treating BC cells with
rapamycin used as a positive control (data not shown). In
addition, enhanced protein expression of sequestosome
1 (p62/SQSTM1), involved in the delivery of autophagic
substrates and nucleation of autophagosomes was
observed by western blot analysis in CPS-treated BC
cells (Figure 1A). Since some autophagy inducers exert
their effects both at p62 synthesis and degradation levels
[20], p62 levels were also evaluated in BC cells treated
with CPS in combination with the lysosomial inhibitor
bafilomycin A (BAF, 25 nM). As shown in Figure
1B, BAF increased the p62 level in CPS-treated cells
demonstrating the ability of CPS to induce an autophagic
flux in BC cells. Similar results were obtained for LC3II levels (Figure 1B). The CPS-induced autophagy was
further confirmed by acridine orange (AO) staining and
FACS analysis. A marked formation of acidic vesicular
organelles (AVOs), a morphological characteristic of the
autophagic process, was observed in CPS-treated BC
cells respect to untreated cells (Figure 1C).

CPS induces oxidative stress that triggers
autophagy in BC cells
The energy sensor AMPK acts as a major
regulator of cellular ATP levels and protects cells against
stresses. Recent evidence demonstrated that activation
of AMPK by calcium and ROS signalling inhibits the
mTOR complex and induces autophagy [21]. Thus,
we evaluated the AMPK activation by measuring its
phosphorylation status (pAMPK), reactive oxygen species
(ROS) generation, the mitochondrial depolarization and
ATP levels in untreated and CPS (300 μM)-treated BC
cells. Time-course immunoblot analysis showed that
enhancement of pAMPK was evident at 1 h, peaked at 3
and 6 h after CPS exposure, remaining sustained at later
time-points (Figure 2A).
ROS signals and mitochondrial alterations have
been associated to vanilloid-mediated effects [22].
Thus, the involvement of ROS production during
stress-induced autophagy was evaluated in CPS-treated
BC cells by cytofluorimetric analysis. We found that
CPS treatment induces ROS generation in BC cells,

with a sustained accumulation which begins at 8 h and
increases at later time-points (Figure 2B). The ROS
scavenger N acetylcysteine (NAC, 10 mM) completely
inhibited ROS production, indicating that CPS stimulates
peroxide accumulation in BC cells (Figure 2C).
Moreover, to better assess the source of CPS-induced
ROS generation, BC cells were treated with CPS alone
or in combination with the mitochondrial respiratory
chain inhibitor rotenone (ROT, 1 μM) or the NAD(P)H
oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 0.1 μM).
As shown in Figure 2C, ROT and DPI markedly reduced
ROS production indicating that CPS treatment affects
both the mitochondrial respiration and the membranebound enzyme complex (Figure 2C). Since mitochondrial
dysfunction is often associated with ROS generation, we
used JC-1 labeling and cytofluorimeter to analyze ΔΨm in

5637 and T24 BC cells. We found that treatment with CPS
induces a time-dependent decrease of red fluorescence
(depolarization). The CPS-induced ΔΨm dissipation was
evident at 6 h, increased at 12 h and remained sustained
at 24 h (Figure 2D). Changes in ADP/ATP ratio are
indicative of alterations in energy metabolism. By using
bioluminescent assay, we also demonstrated that the ADP/
ATP ratio is increased in CPS-treated as compared with
untreated cells (Figure 2E).
The cysteine protease Atg4C, regulated by ROS
generation, is involved in the formation and maturation
of autophagosomes and represents the main cellular target
of oxidative signals in CPS-induced autophagy [23].
Herein we found that CPS increases at 1-6 and 12-24 h
the expression of Atg4C protein in T24 and 5637 BC cells,
respectively (Figure 2F). Finally, by western blot analysis,

(300 μM). Values represent fold differences of individual gene expression in CPS- compared to vehicle-treated BC cells. The
expression levels were normalized to the average Ct value of two housekeeping genes (GAPDH and RPLP0) and calculated by
the ΔΔCt method. In bold up-regulated genes. Data shown are representative of one out of three separate experiments.

we demonstrated that the ROS inhibitor, NAC (10 mM)
reverted the CPS-induced autophagy (Figure 2G). NAC
alone did not induce changes in the LC3 levels respect
to untreated cells (Supplementary Figure 1A). Overall,
our data demonstrated in BC cells that CPS treatment
alters the mitochondrial redox homeostasis and induces
autophagy in a ROS dependent manner.
Finally to evaluate the effects of CPS on
autophagic gene pathway, we performed a RT Profiler
array comparing untreated with CPS-treated BC cells
at 12 h after treatment. We found that GABARAPL1,
MAP1LC3B, SQSTM1, IRGM, ULK1, TNF and PTEN
genes mediating different steps of the autophagic process
were strongly upregulated and FADD and TP73, involved
in the apoptotic pathway and IGF1, implicated in cell
proliferation, were downregulated (Table 1).

during metabolic stress; however excessive autophagy
can also induce cell death [10]. To better understand
the role of CPS-induced autophagy, we evaluated, by
cytofuorimetric analysis, cell death/survival in BC cells
treated for different times with CPS (300 μM) in the
presence or not of the autophagic inhibitor BAF (25
nM). By PI and annexin V staining, we found that CPS
induces necrotic cell death in a time-dependent manner
in 5637 and T24 BC cells, and that BAF enhances the
CPS-induced cytotoxic effects (Figure 3A and 3B).
Moreover, since a pivotal role of Atg6/Beclin-1 in
autophagy, we knocked-down Beclin 1 gene (siBeclin
1) in BC cells. As shown in Figure 3C, Beclin 1 protein
expression was strongly down regulated in siBeclin 1,
compared with control-BC cells (siGLO). The siBeclin 1
and siGLO BC cells were treated with CPS for 72 h and
cell growth was evaluated by MTT assay. Interestingly,
knock-down of Beclin 1, that abrogates CPS-induced
autophagy (Figure 3D), strongly reduced BC cell
growth (Figure 3E). Overall, these results demonstrated
a survival role for CPS-induced autophagy in BC cells.

significantly reduced in CPS-treated cells, respect to
untreated BC cells, whereas vimentin, α5 and β1 integrin
subunits, ILK and Bcl-2 are upregulated (Figure 4D),
indicating the occurrence of EMT and the acquisition of
a more aggressive phenotype in CPS-resistant BC cells.

Since the CPS-induced autophagy acts as a prosurvival process, BC cells were treated with CPS (300
μM) for 72 and 120 h to assess the proliferative capability
by MTT and BrdU incorporation. Our results evidenced
that CPS-resistant BC cells are actively replicating (Figure
4A and 4B), suggesting that they could be responsible for
bladder cancer relapse.
Then, we better characterized the phenotype of CPSresistant BC cells at 120 h after CPS treatment by light
microscopy and cytofluorimetric analysis. As shown in
Figure 4C and Supplementary Figure 1B, CPS-treated BC
cells, displayed an increased cell size and morphological
changes with a conversion from a “cuboidal” epithelial
structure into an elongated mesenchymal shape, compared
to untreated cells, suggesting that prolonged exposure to
CPS stimulates the EMT process in BC cells. To further
address the presence of the EMT phenomenon in CPSresistant BC cells, we investigated the expression of
markers typical of the epithelial mesenchymal transition.
Our results showed that the expression of E-cadherin is

CPS induces autophagy and EMT in an
Hedgehog signaling pathway dependent manner
The Hedgehog pathway has been found to regulate
autophagy and EMT [24–26]. Thus, we first evaluated by
quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) the expression of
different members of Hedgehog signaling pathway, Shh,
Ihh and Dhh ligands, their specific receptors, Patched 1
and 2 (Ptch1 and Ptch2) and some related genes such as
Zeb1, Zeb2, ALCAM and VEGFA in BC cells treated
with CPS for 120 h. Upregulation of the Dhh/Ptch2/Zeb2
pathway as well as downregulation of Shh or Ihh/Ptch1/
Zeb1 genes were observed in CPS-treated BC cells as
respect to untreated cells. In addition, increased CD24,
VEGFA and TIMP1 and decreased CD44 and ALCAM
mRNA levels were found in both T24 and 5637 BC cell
lines (Table 2).

The EMT, induced by CPS, promotes
chemotherapeutic drug-resistance of BC cells

To better investigate the role of the Hedgehog
pathway, BC cells were silenced for PTCH2 (siPTCH2).
A reduction of PTCH2 mRNA was observed in siPTCH2
as respect to siGLO (control) BC cells (Figure 5A).
Therefore, we treated silenced BC cells with CPS for
72 and 120 h to assess autophagy and EMT transition,
respectively. Our results showed that the LC3II/LC3I
ratio is reduced in siPTCH2 compared with siGLO
BC cells (Figure 5B) and more interestingly, FACS
analysis displayed that PTCH2 knockdown decreased
the expression of vimentin and α5 integrin subunit in
CPS-treated cells. Overall our findings demonstrated
that the Hedgehog signaling pathway is involved in
CPS-induced autophagy and EMT phenotype in BC
cells.

Hedgehog signaling pathway activation is positively
correlated with chemoresitance in cancer cells [24, 27]. Thus,
we finally investigated the drug-sensitivity of CPS-induced
EMT cells to chemotherapeutic agents commonly used
in BC therapy. To this purpose, CPS-exposed (120 h) BC
cells, were further treated for additional 48 h with different
doses of mitomycin C, gemcitabine and doxorubicine. As
shown in Figure 6A and 6B, the CPS-resistant BC cells
were significantly less sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents
compared with untreated cells. In fact the IC50 resulted about
two-three fold higher for all tested drugs in CPS-treated BC
cells respect to untreated cells.

consequence of enhanced transcription level as evidenced
by qRT-PCR. Moreover, CPS treatment increased the
expression of autophagic genes such as GABARAPL1
and MAP1LC3B associated with autophagic vesicles
formation [28], IRGM and ULK1 engaged in the
autophagy complex initiation [29], TNFα and PTEN,
involved in autophagy induction [30, 31].
Autophagy promotes stress-induced cell survival
or autophagic cell death [10]. In this regard, we showed
that CPS-induced autophagy mediates a pro-survival
effect in 5637 and T24 BC cells. In fact a marked
increase of necrotic cells was evident in BC cells treated
with CPS in combination with the autophagic inhibitor
BAF. In addition, knockdown of Beclin 1, that inhibits
the CPS-induced autophagy, reduces the growth of BC
cells. Similarly, it has been recently demonstrated that
CPS-induced autophagy rescues breast carcinoma and
osteosarcoma cells from death [11, 12]. Taken together,
our findings indicated that CPS-stimulated autophagy acts
as a mechanism counteracting cell death and contributing
to the survival of BC cells.
The EMT is characterized by morphological changes
from epithelial to spindle-shaped mesenchymal like cells,

DISCUSSION
Herein, we demonstrated that CPS, by triggering
autophagic cell survival, stimulates BC cells to undergo
epithelial mesenchymal transition and to develop
chemotherapeutic drug-resistance through the Hedgehog
signalling pathway.
In CPS-treated BC cells, cellular energy
imbalance resulting from ROS generation, alterations
of ATP levels, mitochondrial depolarization and AMPK
signalling pathway activation, promotes autophagy as
demonstrated by the enhancement of LC3-II/LC3-I ratio
and accumulation of p62 protein evaluated in CPS plus
BAF-treated BC cells. We also demonstrated by using the

increased cell size, loss of cell adhesion as consequence
of changes in integrin expression, in particular α5 β1
overexpression [15], increased invasiveness and expression
of mesenchymal markers especially vimentin [32, 33]. CPS
has been found to induce EMT in colon cancer cells [16], but
no data on BC has been provided so far. To better clarify the
effect of CPS in 5637 and T24 BC cells, we characterized
the phenotype of CPS-resistant BC cells rescued by
autophagy. CPS-treated BC cells show increased cell size
and mesenchymal-like morphology, enhanced expression of
vimentin, α5 and β1 integrin subunits and integrin like kinase

(ILK) and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and downregulation
of E-cadherin. The CPS-induced EMT-positive BC cells
are actively replicating suggesting a possible involvement
in bladder cancer relapse. In agreement with our results, it
is well known that ILK activation is involved in survival,
proliferation, motility, invasion, angiogenesis [34] and that
ILK silencing inhibits EMT, cell growth and metastasis in
BC cells [35]. In addition in BC, increased Bcl-2 proteins,
that correlates with high pathologic stage, disease recurrence
and mortality rate [36], may enhance the resistance to
necrotic death and support the BC autophagic survival.

Activation of the Hedgehog pathway in human BC
cells and its association with BC progression and clinical
outcome have been recently reported [17, 37–39]. Herein,
by qRT-PCR, we observed that exposure of BC cells to
high dose of CPS for 120 h, modulates the expression of
different members of the Hedgehog signaling pathway.
Thus, upregulation of Dhh/Ptch2/Zeb2, as well as
downregulation of Shh and/or Ihh/Ptch1/Zeb1 transcripts
were found in CPS-treated BC cells, as respect to control
cells. In addition, the silencing of PTCH2 gene in BC
cells inhibited the CPS-induced autophagy and reverted
the EMT phenotype, as evaluated by the reduction of
LC3-II, vimentin and α5 integrin subunit. Hedgehog (Hh)
signals acts as survival factor by maintaining the viability
of UC cells and increased Hh activity is required for BC
cell growth. Constitutive activation of different members
(e.g. ligands and receptors) of the Hedgehog pathway

highly correlates with BC progression [17]. Recent
evidence in HeLa cells showed that Ptch2 overexpression,
increased LC3-II levels and autophagy, in the absence
and presence of BAF, and knockdown of PTCH2 reduced
the LC3-II levels in basal and induced autophagy [40].
Increased PTCH2 mRNA expression correlates with
poorer overall survival in muscle-invasive BC [37] and
a functional link of PTCH2 in regulating the activation
of Dhh pathway has been suggested [41]; moreover
enhanced Dhh expression was associated with invasive
prostate and bladder cancers and hormone-refractory
behaviour [42]. In addition, overexpression of Zeb2, a
transcription factor detected in infiltrating UC [43], that
promotes the EMT [44] and regulates the expression of
integrins [45], may be responsible for the increase of α5
integrin expression level in EMT-positive CPS-treated
T24 and 5637 BC cells.

independent experiments. *p<0.01 CPS-treated vs untreated BC cells. IC50 was calculated using GraphPad.

We also found increased expression of EMT-related
genes such as CD24, VEGFA, TIMP1 and decreased
levels of activated cell adhesion (ALCAM/CD166) and
CD44 molecules in BC cell lines treated with CPS. The
CD24 and CD44 antigens mark distinct cell population
in BC [46], and CD24 expression has been associated
with a more aggressive phenotype, reduced survival and
poor prognosis [47]. Metalloproteases and their inhibitors,
TIMPs, play a pivotal role in BC progression. TIMP1
overexpression correlates with pathological stage and
poor prognosis in BC and induces the phenotypic changes
linked with increased vimentin levels [48]. Furthermore,
ALCAM loss/downregulation is associated with a more
invasive phenotype and poorer outcome in BC [49]. Since
the key-role of VEGFA in vimentin expression promoting
EMT changes [50] and chemoresistance [51] in BC cells,
VEGFA overexpression may be partially responsible for
the acquisition of the EMT phenotype and drug resistance
found in CPS-treated BC cells.
The EMT regulates drug-resistance and invasion
in BC cells [36], and EMT prevention increases the
BC sensitivity to anti-neoplastic agents [14]. The
development of chemoresistance during BC treatment
prejudices the effects of the chemotherapy agents and
is responsible for the high morbidity and mortality of
BC in the world [52]. Here, we found that CPS-induced
EMT in BC cells results in an increased drug-resistance
of BC cells to the cytotoxic effects of mitomycin C,
gemcitabine and doxorubicine.
From a clinical point of view, it is now well
established that the induction of autophagy interferes
with the efficacy of cancer therapeutics [53]. In fact,
recent studies reported increased chemoresistance in BC
cells with concurrent up-regulation of autophagy related
genes [54]. At this regard, at present, there is substantial
evidence demonstrating the improved therapeutic effects
by using the established cancer therapeutics agents in
combination with autophagy inhibitors [53].
Overall, our results, showing that the escape of
BC cells from CPS-induced death, by triggering the
autophagic survival, Hedgehog pathway activation,
EMT and chemotherapy drug resistance, are in line with
these recent findings. Therefore the treatment of BC
cells with CPS in combination with specific autophagic
or EMT/Hedgehog pathway inhibitors, could represent
an interesting new approach in BC therapy.

Transfection protocol. Briefly 5637 and T24 cells were
plated in a twenty-four well plate at the density of 5 x 104/
ml and siPTCH2 or siGLO at the concentration of 5nM
were added to the wells for 48 h. Then silenced cells were
detached, counted and plated for MTT, western blot and
FACS analyses.

Lysates were separated on sodium dodecyl sulphate
polyacrylamide gel (9 and 14%) and transferred. After
blocking with 5% low-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) 0.1% Tween 20 for l h, blots were incubated
with the primary Abs: anti-LC3, anti-p62, anti-AMPK,
anti-pAMPK, anti-Atg4C, or anti-GAPDH, followed by
the appropriate HRP-conjugated antibodies. To assess
the autophagic flux, cells were treated with CPS alone or
in combination with BAF (25 nM). The LC3 conversion
was also assessed in BC cells treated for 72 h with CPS
(300 μM) alone or in combination with NAC (10 mM). In
addition, western blot was performed in lysates from siGLO
or siBeclin 1 BC cells, treated or not with CPS (300 μM)
for 72 h, using anti-Beclin 1 or anti-LC3 Abs, to evaluate
silencing efficacy and autophagy respectively. Moreover
LC3 levels were investigated in lysates from siGLO or
siPTCH2 BC cells treated, as above described, with CPS.
The detection was performed using LiteAblot Turbo
(EuroClone, Milano, Italy) and densitometric analysis was
carried out evaluating three independent experiments by
Chemi-Doc using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, CA,
USA). GAPDH levels were used as loading control.

MTT assay
The colorimetric MTT assay was used to evaluate cell
viability. Briefly, 5637 and T24 BC cells (3x104/ml) were
seeded into 96-well plates and cultured with CPS (300 μM)
for 72 and 120 h at 37°C, 5% CO2. At the end of treatment,
0.8 mg/ml of MTT was added to the samples and incubated
for 3 h. Then the supernatants were discarded and coloured
formazan crystals, dissolved with 100 μl/well of DMSO,
were read by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader
(BioTek Instruments, VT, USA). Four replicates were used
for each treatment and data were represented as the average
of at least three separate experiments. In some experiments,
BC cells silenced or not for Beclin 1, were treated with CPS
(300 μM) for 72 h before to perform the MTT assay. Finally
to assess drug resistance, the assay was performed in BC
cells, that after treatment with CPS for 120 h, were detached,
counted, plated at 3x104/ml in a 96 well plate and treated for
additional 48 h with different doses (from 0.01 to 50 μM)
of mitomycin C, gemcitabine and doxorubicine. The half
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined
using GraphPad (GraphPad Software, CA, USA).

ROS production
5637 and T24 BC cells (3x104/ml) were seeded into
24-well plates and cultured for 4, 8, 12, 20 and 24 h with
CPS (300 μM) or vehicle. Cells were washed with PBS,
pulsed with DCFDA for 10 min at 37°C, 5% CO2, and
analyzed by FACScan cytofluorimeter using the CellQuest
software. In some experiments, ROS production was
assessed in BC cells treated for 24 h with CPS (300 μM)
alone or in combination with NAC (10 mM), ROT (1μM)
and DPI (0.1 μM).

Cell death analysis
To evaluate cell death, 5637 and T24 cells (3x104/
ml), untreated or treated for different times (24, 48 and 72
h) with CPS (300 μM) alone or in combination with BAF
(25 nM), were stained with PI. To assess cell death type,
BC cells treated for 72 h with CPS alone or in combination
with BAF were also double stained with Annexin V-FITC
and PI. The percentage of positive cells determined over
10000 events was analysed on a FACScan cytofluorimeter
using the CellQuest software.

Mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm)
ΔΨm was evaluated by JC-1 staining. 5637 and
T24 BC cells (3x104/ml), seeded into 24-well plates, were
treated with CPS (300 μM) or vehicle for different times
(0, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h) and then incubated for 10 min at
room temperature with JC-1. JC-1 was excited by an argon
laser (488 nm); green (530 nrn)/red (>570 nrn) emission
fluorescence was collected simultaneously. Carbonyl cyanide
chlorophenylhydrazone protonophore, a mitochondrial
uncoupler was used as positive control (data not shown).
Samples were analyzed by a FACScan cytofluorimeter using
the CellQuest software; fluorescence intensity was expressed
in arbitrary units on logarithmic scale.

AVO detection
5637 and T24 BC cells (3x104/ml) were seeded into
24-well plates and treated or not with CPS (300 μM) for
48 h. Cells were then washed with medium, stained with
AO (1μg/ml) for 15 min and analyzed on a FACScan
cytofluorimeter using the FL1 and FL3 fluorescence. The
percentage of positive cells determined over 10000 events
was evaluated using the CellQuest software.

SUMMARY

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis

We demonstrated that capsaicin (CPS) induces
autophagic survival in bladder cancer cells that undergo
epithelial mesenchymal transition and acquire a more
aggressive phenotype and drug-resistance by involving
the Hedgehog signaling pathway.

5637 and T24 BC cells, plated in 24 well plate at
the concentration of 3x104/ml, were treated with vehicle
or CPS (300 μM) for 120 h. Then cells were detached,
counted and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at
room temperature. After washing in staining buffer (0.1%
sodium azide, 1% FBS in PBS) cells were stained with
anti-β1 and anti-α5 integrin subunits followed by FITCconjugated secondary Ab. In addition BC cells were also
permeabilized using Perm solution (1% saponin, 0.1%
sodium azide, 1% FBS in PBS) and labelled with anti-E
cadherin, anti-vimentin, anti-ILK and anti-Bcl2 followed
by respective FITC-conjugated secondary Abs. In some
experiments, the expression of vimentin and α5 integrin
subunit was valuated in siGLO and siPTCH2 cells after
treatment for 120 h with CPS. Samples were analysed by
a FACScan cytofluorimeter using the CellQuest software
(Becton Dickinson).
