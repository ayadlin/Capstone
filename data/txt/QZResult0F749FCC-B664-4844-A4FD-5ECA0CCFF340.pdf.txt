Abstract

Author Manuscript

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease of bone marrow failure, cancer susceptibility, and
sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents. FANCD2, the central protein of the FA pathway, is
monoubiquitinated upon DNA damage, such as crosslinkers and replication blockers such as
hydroxyurea (HU). Even though FA cells demonstrate unequivocal sensitivity to crosslinkers, such
as mitomycin C (MMC), we find that they are largely resistant to hydroxyurea (HU), except for
cells absent for expression of FANCD2. FANCD2, RAD51, and RAD18 form a complex, which is
enhanced upon HU exposure. Surprisingly, while FANCD2 is required for this enhanced
interaction, its monoubiquitination is not. Similarly, non-ubiquitinated FANCD2 can still support
PCNA monoubiquitination. RAD51, but not BRCA2, is also required for PCNA
monoubiquitination in response to HU, suggesting that this function is independent of homologous
recombination (HR). We further show that TLS polymerase PolH chromatin localization is
decreased in FANCD2 deficient cells, FANCD2 siRNA knock down cells, and RAD51 siRNA
knock down cells, and PolH knockdown results in HU sensitivity only. Our data suggest that
FANCD2 and RAD51 play an important role in PCNA monoubiquitination and TLS in a FANCD2
monoubiquitination and HR-independent manner in response to HU. This effect is not observed
with MMC treatment, suggesting a non-canonical function for the FA pathway in response to
different types of DNA damage.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

The FA pathway is a DNA repair pathway for DNA interstrand cross-links (ICL). Patients
with FA exhibit birth defects, bone marrow failure, and a lifelong predisposition to cancer,
such as acute myeloid leukemia and head and neck cancer. Cellular hypersensitivity to DNA
cross-link agents, such as MMC, is the hallmark of FA (1–4). At least 16 genes, which when
mutated, have been found to lead to FA(5,6). The FA proteins FANCA, B, C, E, F, G, L, and
M form an upstream core complex with putative E3 ligase activity, whose target is the

FANCD2-FANCI complex(5,7). It is suggested that the FANCD1, J, N, O, P, Q proteins
function downstream of activation of the FANCD2-FANCI complex. Monoubiquitination of
FANCD2 by the core complex is essential for its chromatin localization, DNA repair focus
formation, and function in repairing ICL. These events are implicated in recruitment of
downstream proteins important for homologous recombination, several proteins of which are
part of the FA pathway. RAD51 is a key factor in HR by virtue of its activity of binding to
single strand DNA and forming a nucleoprotein filament in cooperation with BRCA2(8),
which is itself the bona fide FA gene FANCD1(9).

TLS is a mechanism for DNA damage tolerance or post-replication repair involving
switching of the replicative DNA polymerase for specialized translesion polymerases, such
as PolH, PolK and Rev1. By recruiting error-prone polymerases TLS allows replication
machinery to bypass replication-blocking lesions (10,11). The recruitment of TLS
polymerases is regulated by a post-translational modification of proliferation cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) via monoubiquitination. RAD18 is the E3 ligase responsible for PCNA
monoubiquitination in TLS (12). Upon monoubiquitination PCNA recruits TLS polymerases
to chromatin. Our group and others have recently demonstrated RAD18 binding to FANCD2
in a manner critical for normal FA function (13), while others have described the physical
interaction of FANCD2-PCNA (14). This study seeks to understand the relationship between
these pathways.

Author Manuscript

The observation that FANCD2 colocalizes with RAD51 after exposure to DNA damage
induced by MMC and HU indicates that FANCD2 and RAD51 may function together in
repairing DNA damage (15). The interplay between the FA pathway and the TLS pathway
has also been demonstrated. The deubiqutinating enzyme USP1 is responsible for both
FANCD2 and PCNA deubiquitination (16,17). Also, PCNA and RAD18 can interact with
FANCD2 and regulate FANCD2 monoubiquitination (13,14,18). On the other hand, the FA
core complex is required for efficient point mutagenesis and REV1 foci formation in
response to UV irradiation, indicating that FA proteins may participate in regulating TLS in
a way that is independent of FANCD2 monoubiquitination(19). Interestingly, FANCD2
depletion inhibits TLS in Xenopus egg extracts(20). The observation that FANCD2 interacts
with PolH upon DNA damage induced by UV further demonstrates the interplay between
FA pathway and TLS pathway(21). These multiple levels of interaction suggest
cooperativity amongst repair pathways that has the potential to fine tune response to DNA
damage.

Author Manuscript

The colocalization of FANCD2 with RAD51 and PCNA after HU treatment indicates
cooperativity (15). To further understand the function and regulation of DNA repair proteins
we set out to study this relationship in response to distinct types of DNA damaging agents
that stimulate the monoubiquitination response of FANCD2. DNA crosslinkers such as
MMC, stimulate FANCD2 monoubiquitination as well as confer hypersensitivity upon FA
mutant cells. HU depletes the deoxyribonucleotide pool, resulting in replication fork
collapse. HU also stimulates FANCD2 monoubiquitination, but the cytotoxicity effect on FA
mutant cells has not been carefully explored. We find that almost all FA deficient cells are as
resistant to HU as wild type cells, while hypersensitive to MMC, in a manner that is
dependent on FANCD2, regardless of its ability to be monoubiquitinated. We find that

FANCD2 forms a complex with RAD51 and RAD18, which increases upon DNA damage
induced by HU. We then show that HU can induce PCNA monoubiqutination in a FANCD2
and RAD51-dependent fashion but monoubiquitinated FANCD2 independent fashion. The
impaired PolH chromatin localization in FANCD2 and RAD51 deficient cells further
demonstrates that FANCD2 and RAD51 are important in regulating TLS in response to
DNA damage induced by HU. Knockdown of polH results in HU sensitivity only. These
data reveal a novel role of FANCD2 in the DNA damage response that does not depend on
its monoubiquitination.

Results
FANCD2 deficient cells are hypersensitive to HU

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The FA pathway is a DNA repair pathway specialized for repairing DNA ICLs. FA deficient
cells are hypersensitive to cross-linking agents, such as MMC. MMC can induce FANCD2
monoubiquitination, a key step in FA pathway. However, FANCD2 monoubiquitination can
also be induced by other type of DNA damaging agents, such as HU, UV, and ionizing
radiation (22–24). HU is a replication inhibitor and can induce DNA double strand breaks by
causing replication fork arrest upon nucleotide pool depletion (25,26). It has been shown
that FANCD2 plays an important role in protecting replication forks and in replication fork
recovery(27–29). In order to further understand FANCD2 function in response to different
DNA damage agents we compared the MMC and HU hypersensitivity of FANCD2 deficient
cells, FANCA deficient cells, and FANCJ deficient cells. As expected, FANCD2 deficient
cells, FANCA deficient cells and FANCJ deficient cells were all hypersensitive to MMC
(Fig 1). However, only FA-D2 mutant cells expressing no FANCD2 were hypersensitive to
HU, whereas FA-D2 cells containing FANCD2 monoubiquitination mutant K561R, FANCA
deficient cells, which lack monoubiquitinated FANCD2, and FANCJ deficient cells were not
(Fig 1A). These results suggest that non-ubiquitinated FANCD2 play an important but
separate role in repair and response to DNA damage induced by HU. These data also clearly
demonstrate that FA-J mutant cells are HU resistant, contrast to earlier report but are
consistent with much older data concerning cell cycle and HU in FA-A mutant cells(30)
(31).

Author Manuscript

In order to confirm our results, we examined another FA phenotype: cell cycle arrest. Upon
MMC exposure, FA-D2 mutant cells and FA-D2 cells expressing FANCD2
monoubiquitination mutant K561R protein displayed increased G2/M accumulation relative
to corrected cells, as expected (Fig 1B). We also analyzed the cell cycle effect of HU on
these same cells. Instead of G2/M phase HU arrests cells in S phase (32). When cells were
treated with HU, FA-D2 mutant cells displayed the highest amount of S phase arrest, while
significantly less was observed in cells either expressing wild type FANCD2 or
monoubiquitination mutant FANCD2 (K561R) protein (Fig 1B). We confirmed this
observation by measuring S phase cells only with BrdU labeled cells (Supplemental Fig A).
We performed cell counts in parallel, demonstrating that growth kinetics of each cell line is
not markedly different to explain the cell cycle differences (Supplemental Figure A). In FA-J
cells we also observed increased G2/M accumulation relative to corrected cells when
exposed to MMC (Fig 1C). However, FA-J mutant cells did not display higher S phase

accumulation than corrected cells after HU exposure. These data confirm the observation
that mutant cells with absent FANCD2 expression are more sensitive to HU than other
mutant FA cells, as long as FANCD2 is present, regardless of its monoubiquitination status
(Fig 1A). These data were further confirmed by using 2 siRNA separately transfected
knockdown oligos directed against FANCI, the binding partner of FANCD2. Immunoblot
demonstrated effective knockdown, and the resulting depleted cells were MMC sensitive but
HU resistant, consistent with the idea that FANCD2 has a separable function in mediating
resistance to HU (Fig 1D).

Author Manuscript

In order to demonstrate that the FA-D2 cells containing the FANCD2(K561R) ubiquitination
mutant have reduced DNA damage, we subjected the FA-D2 cell group to MMC and HU
and analyzed the lysates for gamma-H2Ax signal, which is increased in proportion to
increased DNA damage. As expected, FA-D2+FANCD2 cells expressed FANCD2 and
responded to MMC or HU for FANCD2 monoubiquitination, whereas FAD2+FANCD2(K561R) cells expressed FANCD2 but is not monoubiquitinated in response to
MMC or HU (Fig 1E, whole cell lysate). In chromatin fraction the wild type containing cells
displayed increased monoubiquitinated FANCD with only modest increase on gamma-H2Ax
signal (Fig 1E, lanes 11 and 12), and the FA-D2 mutant cells displayed marked increase on
gamma-H2Ax signal and no increased K561R ubiquitination mutant protein on chromatin
(lanes 17 and 18) in response to MMC or HU. Interestingly, the K561R ubiquitination
mutant containing cells demonstrated increased signal only in response to MMC (lane 14
versus 15), suggesting that these cells are indeed proficient in the management of DNA
damage induced by HU.

FANCD2-RAD51-RAD18 complex and RAD51-RAD18-PCNA complex interaction increase in
response to HU

Author Manuscript

To further study the role of FANCD2 in HU-induced DNA damage we performed FANCD2
immunoprecipitation to test for binding partners with and without HU treatment. To rule out
the possibility that DNA may play a role in co-precipitation we treated cell lysates with
DNase I before performing FANCD2 immunoprecipitation. We found that RAD51 coimmunoprecipitated with FANCD2 and confirmed interaction of FANCD2 and RAD18,
using Flag immunoprecipitation followed by FANCD2 immunoblotting (Fig 2A).
Interestingly, FANCD2 monoubiquitination mutant also interacts with RAD51 and RAD18
(Fig 2A). We also observed that these interactions were significantly increased with HU and
MMC treatment (Fig 2A, lane 7 versus lanes 8 and 9, lane 16 versus lanes 17 and 18).
RAD51 immunoprecipitation was performed, and RAD18 immunoblotting showed that
RAD18 was co-immunoprecipitated by RAD51, with increased amount after HU treatment
(Fig 2B), suggesting that FANCD2, RAD51 and RAD18 form a complex.
It has been shown that RAD18 was detected as non-monoubiquitinated and
monoubiquitinated forms by Western blot in human cells (33). Monoubiquitinated RAD18
was detected mainly in cytoplasm, whereas non-monoubiquitinated RAD18 was detected
predominantly in the nuclei (33). A recent paper showed that ubiquitination prevents RAD18
from localizing to sites of DNA damage, inducing PCNA monoubiquitination, and
suppressing mutagenesis (Zeman, 2014 #295). Here we observed that FANCD2 and RAD51

predominantly interacts with non-monoubiquitinated RAD18 under our experimental
conditions (Fig 2A and 2B), indicating that these interactions may play a role in PCNA
monoubiquitination and DNA damage response. Interestingly, the interaction of RAD18 and
RAD51 was only increased in the presence of HU (Fig 2B, lane 8) but not MMC (Fig 2B,
lane 9), indicating that DNA repair proteins differentially respond to different DNA damage
agents. It has been previously shown that FANCD2 can interact with PCNA(14). However,
under our experimental conditions, interaction of FANCD2 and PCNA was not detected,
suggesting lack of, transient, or weak interaction. We then tested if RAD51 could interact
with PCNA. Indeed, in a PCNA immunoprecipitation assay we observed that RAD51 was
co-immunoprecipitated with PCNA (Fig 2C). As in the FANCD2, RAD51, and RAD18
interactions, the interaction of RAD51 and PCNA is also increased in response to HU
treatment (Fig 2C, lane 8). Immunoblotting of fractions generated by gel filtration
chromatography of protein extracts from HU treated cells demonstrated co-fractionation of
FANCD2, RAD18, RAD51 and PCNA. All these four proteins were found in a 669kDa
protein complex in extracts from FA-D2+flag-FANCD2 cells (Fig 2D, fraction 21–27). We
pooled these fractions and subjected the extracts to Flag immunoprecipitation. Subsequent
immunoblotting demonstrated the coprecipitation of RAD18 and RAD51 (Supplemental Fig
B). Again we observed that FANCD2 and RAD51 predominantly interacts with nonmonoubiquitinated RAD18 (Supplemental Fig B) although both monoubiquitinated and nonmonoubiquitinated RAD18 were fractionated (Fig 2D).
FANCD2 is required for increased interaction of RAD51 and RAD18

Author Manuscript

Given the increase in interaction of RAD51 and RAD18 in response to HU, we wanted to
test the dependence of this increased interaction upon FANCD2. Therefore, we performed
RAD51 immunoprecipitation in FA-D2 mutant cells lacking FANCD2 expression, FA-D2+
monoubiquitination deficient FANCD2 (K561R) cells, and FA-D2+wild type FANCD2
cells. Our results showed that only in cells lacking FANCD2 expression was the interaction
of RAD51 and RAD18 not enhanced by HU (Fig 3, lane 16), indicating that FANCD2 is a
required component in increased RAD51 and RAD18 complex formation. Again, RAD51
predominantly interacts with non-monoubiquitinated RAD18. Interestingly, FANCD2
monoubiquitination deficient mutant also promoted the interaction of RAD51 and RAD18 in
response to HU even though not as strongly as wild type FANCD2 (Fig 3, lane 18),
indicating that FANCD2 monoubiquitination is not critical for increased complex formation.
FANCD2 and RAD51 are required for PCNA monoubiquitination in response to HU

Author Manuscript

Our immunoprecipitation data suggest that in response to HU, FANCD2-RAD51-RAD18
and RAD51-PCNA interactions are enhanced. Because RAD18 is responsible for PCNA
monoubiquitination, one possible explanation is that FANCD2 and RAD51 participate in
PCNA monoubiquitination, and in turn, TLS. Although PCNA ubiquitination can be
triggered by HU it has not been shown that the ubiquitination is RAD18-dependent(34).
Because PCNA can be ubiquitinated by enzymes other than RAD18(35,36) we first tested
whether HU induced PCNA monoubiquitination depends on RAD18 under our experimental
conditions using RAD18−/− and wild type cells. Immunoblotting of the chromatin fraction
showed that HU treatment not only enhanced FANCD2 monoubiquitination but also
enhanced PCNA monoubiquitination and that the enhanced PCNA monoubiqutination was

dependent on RAD18 (Fig 4A). We then examined PCNA monoubiquitination in FANCD2
or RAD51 siRNA knock down cells. The Dharmacon SmartPool siRNA was used to knock
down FANCD2 or Rad51 in 293T cells. We found that in control knock down 293T cells
PCNA monoubiquitination as measured by mean value of ub-PCNA was enhanced.
However, the enhancement of monoubiquitinated PCNA was minimized in FANCD2 or
RAD51 siRNA knock down cells (Fig 4B, lane 12 and 18), suggesting that FANCD2 and
RAD51 play important roles in PCNA monoubiquitination in response to HU. Interestingly,
MMC treatment did not increase the level of monoubiquitinated PCNA. One of the possible
explanations for these results might be that RAD18, RAD51, and FANCD2 complex
formation occurs only in response to HU treatment (Fig 2A and 3). USP1 is the enzyme
responsible for PCNA deubiquitination(17). The USP1 level and chromatin localization
were similar in control knock down cells and RAD51 knock down cells (Supplemental
Figure C), suggesting that USP1 is not responsible for diminished PCNA
monoubiquitination. Instead, FANCD2 and RAD51 may stimulate PCNA
monoubiquitination through RAD18, as suggested by our immunoprecipitation data. The
observation that FANCD2 monoubiquitination, which is also deubiquitinated by USP1(16),
was normal in RAD51 knock down cells (Fig 4B, lane 5 and 6) further supports this idea. To
confirm the specificity of knock down results we repeated these experiments using two
individually-transfected siRNAs directed against FANCD2 and RAD51, respectively.
Immunoblotting showed significant knockdown as well as similar monoubiquitination
response to HU (Supplemental Fig D). We also examined the PCNA in soluble fraction of
cells. The level of PCNA was not changed in all cell lines and under different treatment
conditions, and no ubiquitinated PCNA was observed (Supplemental Fig. D).

Author Manuscript

These data also suggest that, given the differential effect of MMC and HU, the role of
RAD51 in monoubiquitination of PCNA and thus HU resistance may not involve its
canonical role in HR. To test this idea, we utilized the RAD51 inhibitor B02 and C34 cells,
which contain the GFP cassette and RFP cassette to measure HR and NHEJ(37). Exposure
of C34 cells to B02 resulted in no change in monoubiquitinated PCNA response to HU.
However, HR was impaired, suggesting a non-canonical role for RAD51 in the response to
HU-induced DNA damage (Supplemental Fig E).

Author Manuscript

To confirm the result from the siRNA knock down experiment and investigate the role of
monoubiquitination of FANCD2 we tested PCNA monoubiquitination in FA-D2 mutant
cells, FA-D2 cells expressing FANCD2(K561R), and FA-D2 cells expressing wild type
FANCD2. The results showed that FANCD2 deficient cells failed to enhance PCNA
monoubiquitination in response to HU, whereas cells expressing wild type FANCD2 could
rescue PCNA monoubiquitination as measured by mean value of ub-PCNA (Fig 4C, lane
12). Interestingly, the cells expressing FANCD2 monoubiquitination deficient mutant could
also rescue PCNA monoubiquitination, even though the level is not as high as wild type
FANCD2 (Fig 4C, lane 15). These data suggest that FANCD2 is required for enhancing
PCNA monoubiquitination in response to HU, and FANCD2 monoubiquitination status is
not critical for this activity.

The regulation of PCNA monoubiqutination by RAD51 is independent of BRCA2

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

RAD51 and its chromatin localization are very important for its function in HR. BRCA2
interacts with RAD51 and is responsible for loading RAD51 to chromatin at double strand
breaks for the performance of HR. To study the relationship between the role of RAD51 in
regulating PCNA monoubiquitination and its relationship to HR, we tested for RAD51
chromatin localization and PCNA monoubiquitination in BRCA2 mutant cells EUFA423.
EUFA423 cells are derived from an FA patient with complementation group D1 and have
biallelic mutations (7691 insAT and 9900 insA) in BRCA2 that result in two different
truncated forms of BRCA2(9). As expected RAD51 chromatin localization was impaired in
BRCA2 deficient cells compared with wild type cells, although total cellular RAD51 in
BRCA2 deficient cells was unchanged. However, in response to HU monoubiquitinated
PCNA was increased to a similar level in both BRCA2 deficient and wild type cells,
indicating that RAD51 chromatin localization is not required for regulating PCNA
monoubiquitination, thus representing a function of RAD51 that is independent of HR (Fig
5A). We confirmed these data using an additional BRCA2 (−/−)cell line DLD1 (Horizon
Discovery; Supplemental Fig F). These data again show that BRCA2 is not required for
hydroxyurea resistance. We tested for cell survival of BRCA2 (−/−)and BRCA2 wild type
cells to both MMC and HU. As expected, the BRCA2 mutant cells were hypersensitive only
to MMC but not HU (Fig 5B).
FANCA and FANCJ deficient cells exhibit PCNA monoubiquitination

Author Manuscript

FANCA is a component of the core complex of the FA pathway and is required for FANCD2
monoubiquitination. We expected that FANCA deficient cells would behave like FANCD2
monoubiquitination mutant cells with respect to PCNA monoubiquitination, as in Figure 4C.
Indeed, in FANCA deficient cells FANCD2 was not monoubiquitinated, as expected, in
response to HU. Consistent with data shown earlier using cells containing
monoubiquitination deficient FANCD2, both FANCA deficient and proficient cells
responded to HU by displaying PCNA monoubiquitination in response to HU, and FA-A
cells, like monoubiquitination deficiet FANCD2 cells, showed slightly lower PCNA
monoubiquitination than FANCA proficient cells (Fig 5C, lanes 6 and 8). Next, we analyzed
another FA mutant cell line, FANCJ-deficient cells, for PCNA monoubiquitination in
response to HU. In FANCJ deficient cells PCNA monoubiquitination was similar to that in
FANCJ proficient cells (Fig 5D), suggesting that FANCJ is not required for PCNA
monoubiquitination. These results indicate that the effect of FANCD2 on PCNA
monoubiquitination is independent of both the upstream FA core complex and downstream
FA effector proteins.

PolH chromatin localization is decreased in FANCD2 deficient cells and RAD51 siRNA
knock down cells
We have shown that FANCD2 and RAD51 are required for PCNA monoubiquitination in
response to HU. PCNA monoubiquitination regulates the DNA polymerase switching in
TLS (38) (39) (40). To confirm HU-induced PCNA monoubiquitination plays a role in TLS
we tested for chromatin localization of TLS polymerases PolH and PolK in response to HU
in FANCD2 or RAD51 pooled siRNA (Dharmicon) knock down cells. In control knock

down cells PolH chromatin localization was increased in response to HU (Fig 6A, lane 15).
However, in FANCD2 or RAD51 siRNA knock down cells PolH chromatin localization
failed to increase when treated with HU (Fig 6A, lanes 12 and 18). MMC treatment, in
contrast, did not enhance the chromatin localization of PolH (Fig 6A, lane 14), consistent
with the observation that PCNA monoubiquitination is enhanced by FANCD2 and RAD51
in response to HU but not MMC. These data confirm the roles of FANCD2 and RAD51 in
regulating TLS through PCNA monoubiquitination in response to HU. Interestingly, PolK
level on chromatin is unaffected in FANCD2 or RAD51 siRNA knock down cells (Fig 6A).
This may be because PolH has one ubiquitin binding domain and binds to
monoubiquitinated PCNA, while PolK has two ubiquitin binding domains and binds to
polyubiquitinated PCNA(41) (42). To confirm the specificity of FANCD2 and RAD51
knock down we repeated knock down experiment using two individually-transfected siRNAs
directed against FANCD2 and RAD51, respectively. Immunoblotting showed significant
knockdown as well as similar PolH chromatin localization in response to HU (Supplemental
Fig G). The results from knock down cells were confirmed in FANCD2 deficient cells (Fig
6B). In addition, the FANCD2 monoubiquitination mutant cells and FANCA deficient cells
also promoted PolH chromatin localization in response to HU (Fig 6B and 6C), although not
as strongly as wild type, in agreement with the PCNA monoubiquitination data. This again
suggests that non-ubiquitinated FANCD2 can respond to HU and promote PCNA
monoubiquitination and TLS. In order to demonstrate the specificity of polH in the context
of HU, we performed siRNA knockdown using 2 different siRNAs directed against polH.
Significant knockdown was achieved, as evidenced by immunoblotting (Fig 6D).
Interestingly, PolH knockdown cells showed significant hypersensitivity to HU but not to
MMC, consistent with the specific involvement of TLS-associated activities of PolH.

Author Manuscript

RAD51 deficient cells are hypersensitive to HU
We tested cellular sensitivity to MMC and HU in RAD51 knock down cells. We
demonstrated knockdown with pooled siRNA (Dharmicon) by immunoblot (Fig. 6A). As
expected, these cells showed hypersensitivity to HU and MMC (Fig. 7). These results were
confirmed by using 2 specific siRNA knockdown oligos, which we transfected separately
into 293T cells, confirming knockdown by immunoblotting. These resulting cells displayed
the same sensitivity to both HU as well as MMC (Supplemental Fig H). These data support
the idea that RAD51 plays an important role in resolving the DNA damage induced by HU
in a non-HR dependent fashion.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

Although different DNA repair pathways are responsible for different kinds of DNA
damage, the components of one pathway may be important for repair of multiple types of
DNA damage, especially for lesions as complex as interstrand crosslinks. Previously, we
showed that mismatch repair proteins MSH2 and MLH1 could regulate FANCD2
monoubiquitination and ICL repair(43). The E3 ligase RAD18 is important for PCNA
monoubiquitination and TLS but also plays an important role in FANCD2
monoubiquitination(13,18). PCNA itself has been shown to regulate FANCD2 function(14).
In our work, we find that all FA mutant cells examined, except FA-D2 null mutant cells,

which are largely devoid of FANCD2 protein, are nonetheless resistant to hydroxyurea.
These data are supported by the response to γH2Ax, which is increased in mutant FA cells
in response to MMC but to HU only in FA-D2 deletion mutant cells. We then show that
FANCD2 can interact with RAD18 and RAD51, even when non-monoubiquitinated, and
RAD51 can also interact with RAD18 and PCNA (Fig 2), suggesting that FANCD2,
RAD51, and RAD18 form a complex in a manner that regulates PCNA. These interactions
are enhanced in response to HU (Fig 2B and 3). We further show that HU induced PCNA
monoubiquitination is RAD18-dependent (Fig 4A). This is distinctly different from FAdependent TLS in MMC-induced repair, which is RAD18-independent (44). More
importantly, we find that FANCD2 and RAD51, but not BRCA2, are required for PCNA
monoubiquitination and TLS in response to DNA damage caused by HU (Fig 4B and 4C).
This represents a non-canonical role for RAD51, since pharmacological inhibition of the HR
function does not abolish PCNA monoubiquitination. The enhanced PCNA
monoubiquitination and PolH chromatin localization are abrogated in either RAD51 knock
down cells or FANCD2 deficient cells (Fig 4B and 4C) supporting the idea that FANCD2,
RAD51, and RAD18 form a complex to promote damage specific TLS. It is likely this
complex regulates PCNA monoubiquitination in response to HU. It has also been shown that
FANCD2 and RAD51 play an important role in replication fork protection and that this
FANCD2 mediated fork protection is epistatic with RAD51 function(27). These data are
also supportive of the idea that PCNA undergoes polymerase switching, as only PolH is
induced by HU, but not MMC, and knockdown of PolH renders cells HU sensitive but not
MMC sensitive. Taken together our data demonstrate that besides ICL repair, HR, and
replication protection, FANCD2 and RAD51 together also play important and distinct roles
in TLS in response to DNA damage caused by HU (Fig 8). Their function in PCNA
monoubiquitination and TLS polymerase switching in response to HU may also play an
important role in HU resistance. Our data that RAD51 knock down cells are similarly
hypersensitive to HU as FA-D2 cells support this idea, as do previous data that PCNA
monoubiquitination mutant cells were hypersensitive to HU(34).

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, the monoubiquitination of FANCD2 is dispensable for its role in response to
HU, an agent primarily thought to lead to replication fork collapse. The function of nonmonoubiquitinated FANCD2 may explain the fact that FA patients with absent FANCD2
protein expression have a more severe clinical phenotype than those with core complex
protein mutations(3). In an analogous fashion, FANCD2 deficient mice display higher
magnitude of DNA damage than FANCG deficient mice(45). We also did not observe the
involvement of FANCD2 and RAD51 in PCNA monoubiquitination in the DNA damage
response caused by MMC, and PCNA is only weakly monoubiquitinated in response to
MMC, suggesting that the role of FANCD2 and RAD51 in PCNA monoubiquitination and
TLS may be HU specific. Ho et. al. also showed that PCNA is only weakly
monoubiquitinated in response to MMC(46). In addition, Howlett et. al. showed that
FANCD2 is not required for PCNA monoubiqutination in response to UV damage(14). It
has also been shown that in response to UV, FANCA and FANCG play important roles in
regulating Rev1 foci formation in a PCNA monoubiquitination-independent manner (19).
These data indicate that different DNA damage may activate different DNA repair pathways,

even in the FA pathway, and conversely, different DNA repair proteins cooperate to repair
damage induced by different DNA damage agents.

Indeed, damage-specific regulation of TLS has been shown. Helicase-like transcription
factor (HLTF) and SNF2 histone-linker PHD-finger RING-finger helicase (SHPRH) are
Rad5 homologs involved in PCNA ubiquitination and TLS polymerase recruitment,
contributing in different ways to specify DNA damage induced mutagenesis. In response to
the DNA damage caused by UV, HLTF enhances PCNA monoubiquitination and PolH
recruitment and inhibits SHPRH function. However, in response to DNA damage caused by
MMS, HLTF degradation is promoted, and the interaction of SHPRH with RAD18 and PolK
is enhanced, leading to the recruitment of PolK (42). Our data showed that PolH, but not
PolK, chromatin localization is regulated by FANCD2 and RAD51 in response to HU. We
speculate that HLTF may be used in FANCD2 and RAD51 regulated PCNA
monoubiquitination and TLS.

Author Manuscript

A recent publication that PolH can interact with monoubiquitinated FANCD2 also connects
monoubiquitinated FANCD2 with PolH in UV damage(21), supporting our observation that
FANCD2 plays an important role in recruiting PolH and TLS in response to HU. Although
we show that FANCA and FANCD2 monoubiquitination are not required for this function in
response to HU, the difference might be due to a differential response of cells to types of
DNA damage. Interestingly, FANCA and FANCG, but not FANCD2, have been shown to
play important roles in Rev1 foci formation in response to UV damage(19). However,
FANCG deficiency did not affect PCNA monoubiquitination or change PolH foci formation
significantly in response to UV damage. We show that in response to HU damage FANCD2,
but not FANCA, is important for PolH recruitment (Fig 6). PCNA monoubiquitination and
TLS may be regulated differentially in response to different DNA damage.
Recruitment of RAD51 to chromatin by BRCA2 is required for its function in HR, which is
important ultimately for ICL repair(8). The colocalization of FANCD2 and RAD51 has been
observed previously(15), and it has been shown that FANCD2 deficient cells are defective in
efficient HR repair(47). However, here we show that RAD51 also plays an important role in
PCNA monoubiquitination and TLS in a HR-independent manner in response to HU. As
RAD51 also plays an important role in restarting HU-stalled replication forks without
triggering HR(48), the activities we observe in this investigation may represent an alternative
regulatory pathway involving exclusively DNA replication. Alternatively, and perhaps more
compellingly, this phenomenon may be a means of coordinating replication and repair, thus
utilizing components in common to both pathways.

Immunoprecipitation

Author Manuscript

293T cells and FANCD2 deficient and proficient cells were cultured on 15 cm2 plates and
treated with or without 0.5 μM MMC or 0.5 mM HU overnight prior to harvest. Following
PBS wash, whole cell lysate was prepared by adding 1 ml of the whole cell lysis buffer (300
mM NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM NaVO4, 2 mM Na4O7P2, 0.02% NaN3,
and 50 mM Tris, pH7.4) with proteinase inhibitors. Following 10 second sonication extracts
were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C. Supernatants were
saved, and equal amounts of extract (2 mg protein) were used for each immunoprecipitation.
The lysates were treated with DNase I (20u) for 15 min. at room temperature then 15 min. at
37°C. Then 2 μg antibody [FANCD2(H-300), RAD51(C20), PCNA(PC10), or normal rabbit
or mouse IgG, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA] were added. After incubation overnight at 4°C,
protein G beads were added for another 4 hours. Beads were washed 4 times, and the pellets
were subjected to immunoblot analysis.

Protein samples were suspended in SDS Loading Buffer (50mM Tris-Cl pH6.8, 2% SDS,
0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 5 minutes.
Samples were run on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were blocked in TBS-T(TBS+0.1%
Tween-20) with 10% milk for 1.5 hours and incubated in primary antibody (FANCD2
1:2000, RAD51 1:2000, PCNA 1:500, Ku86 1:5000, Santa Cruz, and RAD18 1:1000,
Bethyl) for one hour at room temperature in TBS-T+1% milk. After washing, membranes
were incubated in secondary antibody(ECL anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG-HRP,
Amersham, Princeton, NY) 1:5000 in TBS-T+1% milk for 1 hour at room temperature.
Blots were washed in TBS-T three times for 5 minutes each and developed by
chemiluminescence (Supersignal West Pico Kit or Supersignal West Femto kit, Pierce,
Rockford, IL). The quantification of Western blot was carried out using ImageJ software. We
measured mean values of each band with fixed area. The relative values of each band were
shown. For ub-PCNA we measured mean values of each band, and the values were then
corrected with mean values of PCNA. The final values were shown.

Procedures for permeabilization and subnuclear extraction were described previously (49).
In brief, after PBS wash cells on 15cm2 plates were harvested by scraping, and centrifuged
for five minutes to obtain the pellet. The soluble fraction was extracted by suspending the
cells in 1ml of low salt buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, and 50 μg/ml digitonin)
containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1
μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM Na3VO4) for 15 min at
4°C. Permeabilized nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 2000 rpm, 5 min, at 4°C. The
supernatant was termed the soluble fraction. The nuclei were washed three additional times
in the same buffer. After wash, the nuclei were resuspended in 200 μl of low salt buffer
containing 40 units of DNase I (RNase free, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) for 15
minutes at room temperature and then an additional 15 minutes at 37°C, then pelleted again.
Supernatant was set aside. The pellet was extracted once more with extraction buffer (1%
Triton X-100, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, and 30 mM Na4P2O7•10H2O, 10 mM
NaF, and 1 mM EDTA) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 15 min, 4°C.
Supernatant was collected at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge for 10 min and pooled with the low
salt buffer+DNase I supernatant to form the chromatin fraction. Cellular fractions were
analyzed by immunoblot.
siRNA Knock Down

Author Manuscript

293T cells were grown to 50% confluence in DMEM with 10% FBS. 60 nM FANCD2 or
RAD51 siRNA pool (siGENOME SMARTpool) and non-targeting control siRNA
(Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) were transfected in 293T cells using X-tremeGENE siRNA
transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For
individual siRNA knock down the sequences used are: FANCD2-18
(GAACAAAGGAAGCCGGAAU), FANCD2-2 (GAUAAGUUGUCGUCUAUUA),
RAD51-7 (CCAACGAUGUGAAGAAAUU), RAD51-2(GAAGCUAUGUUCGCCAUUA),
PolH-7 (GCACUUACAUUGAAGGGUU), PolH-8 (GCAAUUAGCCCAGGAACUA),
FANCI-2 (GUAAGAGCCUGAACUAUAC), FANCI-3 (GAUGGGAGUUUGUGAGGUU).
The second transfection was performed next day after first transfection to ensure maximum
knock down. Whole cell lysate and chromatin fractions were made from cells 5 days after
the first transfection and then analyzed by immunoblot.
Cell survival assay

Author Manuscript

Cells were grown in 6-well plates with or without MMC or HU in the indicated
concentrations for 5 days. After wash with PBS cells were fixed with 10% acetic acid and
10% methanol for 5 minutes then stained with 1% crystal violet for 3 minutes. After
washing and allowing the plates to dry, the stain was dissolved with 0.1% SDS in methanol
and read at wavelength 595 nm in a microplate reader.
Cell cycle analysis
Cells were collected and washed in PBS (-Ca++, -Mg++), then fixed with 70% ethanol
overnight at 4°C. After wash with PBS cells were subjected to RNase treatment (20 μg/ml)
and propidium iodide staining (10 μg/ml) at 37°C for 30 minutes. Cellular fluorescence was

FlowJo software. For S phase analysis Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated BrdU antibody was used
(EMD Millpore corporation). After overnight treatment of HU cells were incubated with 10
μM BrdU for two hours. Harvested cells were then washed with PBS and fixed with cold
70% ethanol overnight at 4°C. After wash cells were then treated with 2 mM HCl at room
temperature for 30 min. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated with BrdU
antibody (1:50) at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were washed once with PBS and then
subjected to RNase treatment (20 μg/ml) and propidium iodide staining (10 μg/ml) at 37°C
for 30 minutes.
HR assay

Author Manuscript

C34 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% Tet free serum in 6-well plate. Cells were pretreated with 20 μM RAD51 inhibitor B02 (EMD Millipore Corporation) for 2 hours, then
ligand Shield 1 (Clontech, 2 μl/ml) and triamcinolone acetonide (100 μM) were added to
cells for overnight to induce double strand break. Cells were washed and replaced with fresh
media. Three days later the cells were harvested and analyzed through FACS for GFP (HR
positive) and RFP (NHEJ positive) cells.

(A) FA-D2, FA-D2+FANCD2, FA-D2+FANCD2(K561R), FA-A, FA-A+FANCA, FA-J and
FA-J+FANCJ cells were treated with MMC or HU with the concentrations as indicated in
graph for 5 days. Cell survival was analyzed by crystal violet staining. (B and C) 100,000 of
FA-D2, FA-D2+FANCD2, FA-D2+FANCD2(K561R), FA-J and FA-J+FANCJ cells from
each treatment were collected after exposure to MMC or HU for 22 hours. The cells were
then processed, as in the Materials and Methods section. Flow cytometry was performed to
measure DNA content. (D) FANCI was knocked down in 293T cells using two different

Figure 4. FANCD2 and RAD51 are required for PCNA monoubiquitination in response to HU

Author Manuscript

A) RAD18 is responsible for PCNA monoubiquitination in response to HU. HCT116 and
HCT116 (RAD18−/−) cells were treat or not with 0.5 mM HU overnight. The whole cell
lysate and chromatin fraction were prepared and analyzed by immunoblot with PCNA and
FANCD2 antibodies. Ku86 was used as loading control. (B) PCNA monoubiquitination is
decreased in FANCD2 or RAD51 siRNA knock down 293T cells. FANCD2 and RAD51
were knocked down by FANCD2 and RAD51 siRNA, respectively in 293T cells. The
knockdown cells were then treated or not with 0.5 μM MMC or 0.5 mM HU overnight. The
whole cell lysate and chromatin fraction were prepared and analyzed by immunoblot with
RAD51, PCNA and FANCD2 antibodies. Ku86 was used as loading control. Mean value of
ub-PCNA is reported. (C) FANCD2, but not its monoubiquitination, is required for PCNA
monoubiquitination. FA-D2, FA-D2+FANCD2 and FA-D2+FANCD2 (K561R) cells were
treated or not with 0.5 μM MMC or 0.5 mM HU overnight. The whole cell lysate and
chromatin fraction were prepared and analyzed by immunoblot with PCNA and FANCD2
antibodies. Ku86 was used as loading control. Mean value of ub-PCNA is reported.

Figure 8. Multifunctionality of DNA repair proteins

FA proteins are responsible for ICL repair. FA core complex is also important for Rev1 foci
formation in response to UV in PCNA monoubiquitination-independent manner. FANCD2
also interacts with RAD51, RAD18 and PCNA and regulate PCNA monoubiqutination and
PolH chromatin localization in response to HU. RAD51 is a key player for HR and TLS. It
also interacts with FANCD2, RAD18 and PCNA and is required for PCNA
monoubiquitination and PolH chromatin localization in response to HU.
