ABSTRACT
Rotenone, a neurotoxic pesticide, induces loss of dopaminergic neurons related
to Parkinson’s disease. Previous studies have shown that rotenone induces neuronal
apoptosis partly by triggering hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-dependent suppression of
mTOR pathway. However, the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Here,
we show that rotenone elevates intracellular free calcium ion ([Ca2+]i) level, and
activates CaMKII, resulting in inhibition of mTOR signaling and induction of neuronal
apoptosis. Chelating [Ca2+]i with BAPTA/AM, preventing extracellular Ca2+ influx using
EGTA, inhibiting CaMKII with KN93, or silencing CaMKII significantly attenuated
rotenone-induced H2O2 production, mTOR inhibition, and cell death. Interestingly,
using TTFA, antimycin A, catalase or Mito-TEMPO, we found that rotenone-induced
mitochondrial H2O2 also in turn elevated [Ca2+]i level, thereby stimulating CaMKII,
leading to inhibition of mTOR pathway and induction of neuronal apoptosis. Expression
of wild type mTOR or constitutively active S6K1, or silencing 4E-BP1 strengthened the
inhibitory effects of catalase, Mito-TEMPO, BAPTA/AM or EGTA on rotenone-induced
[Ca2+]i elevation, CaMKII phosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis. Together, the
results indicate that the crosstalk between Ca2+ signaling and mitochondrial H2O2
is required for rotenone inhibition of mTOR-mediated S6K1 and 4E-BP1 pathways.
Our findings suggest that how to control over-elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and
overproduction of mitochondrial H2O2 may be a new approach to deal with the
neurotoxicity of rotenone.

INTRODUCTION

(ROS) in HL-60 and other cells [5]. Mitochondrial enzyme
deficiency in rat brain is correlated with the generation of
free radicals post administration of rotenone [6]. Mounting
studies have demonstrated that rotenone contributes to
decreased ATP synthesis, mitochondrial depolarization,
and ROS generation via inhibiting mitochondrial
respiratory chain complex I [3, 4]. Excessive ROS in
turn will further inhibit complex I [7]. The vicious cycle
eventually causes apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons,
leading to Parkinson’s disease (PD) [7-14]. Thus,
rotenone is a possible etiological factor in PD. However,

Rotenone, a well-known neurotoxic pesticide, is
highly lipophilic and easily traverses the blood-brain
barrier and cellular membranes without depending upon
dopamine transporters for access to the cytoplasm of
neurons [1, 2]. Once inside cells, rotenone impedes
mitochondrial function leading to intracellular oxidative
stress [3, 4]. Rotenone induces apoptosis by increasing
generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species

RESULTS

the molecular mechanism underlying the neurotoxicity of
rotenone is still not fully understood.
Calcium ion (Ca2+) is important for many cellular
events, such as proliferation/growth, differentiation,
development and cell death [15]. When properly
controlled, Ca2+ fluxes across the plasma membrane
and between intracellular compartments play critical
roles in fundamental functions of neurons, including
the regulation of neurite outgrowth and synaptogenesis,
synaptic transmission and plasticity, and cell survival
[16]. However, disturbances in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis
cause synaptic dysfunction, impaired plasticity and
neuronal degeneration [16-19]. Especially, abnormally
high levels of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) induces
overproduction of free radicals such as ROS, which can
activate stress cascades, resulting in apoptosis [20, 21].
In turn, excessive or sustained ROS can also exacerbate
Ca2+ overload and sensitize the bioactivity of Ca2+ [20,
22, 23]. The interconnection between Ca2+ and ROS alters
the structures and functions of cellular proteins, and also
activates or inhibits related signaling pathways, leading to
neuronal apoptosis [20, 24-27].
Mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin
(mTOR), a serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) protein kinase,
regulates differentiation, development and survival
in neurons [28-30]. Thus, mTOR exerts a crucial role
in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, and food
uptake in adult brain [28-30]. Increasing evidence reveals
that mTOR could be activated or inhibited depending
on the pathologic status of the nervous system, e.g.
brain tumors, tuberous sclerosis, cortical dysplasia and
neurodegenerative diseases such as PD, Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), and Huntington’s disease (HD) [28, 30]. Our
group has observed that cadmium, a heavy metal polluted
in the environment, induces neuronal cell death by [Ca2+]iand/or ROS-dependent activation of mTOR signaling [3134], whereas hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a major radical of
ROS, elicits neuronal cell death via suppression of mTOR
pathway [35]. Recently, we have also found that rotenone
evokes neuronal apoptosis via H2O2-dependent inhibition
of mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of ribosomal p70
S6 kinase (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E
(eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) [14, 36]. Intracellular
Ca2+ elevation is a major factor for rotenone-induced
apoptosis in neuronal cells [37]. Hence, in this study, we
investigated whether rotenone induces apoptosis by Ca2+/
ROS-dependent inhibition of mTOR pathway.

Rotenone-induced neuronal apoptosis is
associated with its induction of [Ca2+]i elevation
Increased [Ca2+]i levels have been documented
in many experimental models of apoptosis [37-39]. To
understand how Ca2+ signaling participates in rotenoneinduced neuronal apoptosis, first of all, we investigated
the relationship between the [Ca2+]i level and the apoptosis
in our neuronal cell models treated with rotenone. After
PC12 cells and mouse primary neurons were treated
with 0-1 μM rotenone for 24 h, [Ca2+]i was measured by
using an intracellular Ca2+ indicator dye, Fluo-3/AM. We
found that rotenone elicited strong [Ca2+]i fluorescence (in
green) (Figure S1A), and the intensity of the fluorescence
was rotenone concentration-dependent (Figure 1A).
Concurrently, rotenone decreased cell viability (Figure
1B), and increased nuclear fragmentation and condensation
(arrows), a hallmark of apoptosis [40], as well as TUNELpositive cells (in green) in PC12 cells and primary neurons
(Figure S1B, Figure 1C and 1D), respectively. Besides,
treatment with rotenone for 24 h induced robust cleavages
of caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in
the cells (data not shown). Collectively, these data imply
that rotenone-induced neuronal apoptosis is associated
with the induction of [Ca2+]i elevation.

Rotenone elicits neuronal apoptosis via Ca2+mediated inhibition of mTOR pathway
Our recent studies have shown that rotenone induces
neuronal apoptosis by inhibiting mTOR pathway [36].
Having observed that rotenone-elevated [Ca2+]i is involved
in neuronal apoptosis (Figure 1), next we asked whether
the elevation of [Ca2+]i is responsible for rotenone-induced
inhibition of mTOR signaling and apoptosis of neuronal
cells. To this end, PC12 cells and primary neurons were
treated with/without rotenone (0.5 and 1 µM) for 24 h
following pre-incubation with/without 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA/
AM, 30 µM), an intracellular Ca2+ chelator, for 1 h. We
found that BAPTA/AM significantly attenuated rotenonetriggered [Ca2+]i elevation (Figure 2A) and substantially
prevented rotenone from inhibiting the phosphorylation
of mTOR, S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (Figure 2B). Rotenoneinduced cleavage of caspase-3 was also remarkably
inhibited by BAPTA/AM (Figure 2B). In line with this,
BAPTA/AM markedly prevented rotenone-induced cell
viability reduction (Figure S2A), nuclear fragmentation
and condensation (Figure 2C) in PC12 cells and primary
neurons as well. The results suggest that rotenone-elevated
[Ca2+]i contributes to inhibition of mTOR pathway and
induction of neuronal apoptosis.

Rotenone elicits Ca2+-dependent CaMKII
phosphorylation leading to inhibition of mTOR
pathway and neuronal apoptosis

To further define the role of rotenone-elevated [Ca2+]
in suppressing mTOR pathway, we extended our studies
i
using ethylene glycol tetra-acetic acid (EGTA, 100 µM),
an extracellular Ca2+ chelator. The results showed that
inhibition of extracellular Ca2+ influx by EGTA profoundly
prevented rotenone-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i ( Figure
2D) and inhibition of phosphorylation of mTOR, S6K1
and 4E-BP1 (Figure 2E) in PC12 cells and primary
neurons. Furthermore, EGTA also partially blocked
rotenone-induced cleavage of caspase-3 (Figure 2E),
viability reduction (Figure S2B) and apoptosis (Figure
2F) in the cells. The results indicate that rotenone-induced
extracellular Ca2+ influx is involved in inhibition of mTOR
pathway leading to neuronal apoptosis. Our findings
strongly support the notion that rotenone elicits neuronal
apoptosis via Ca2+-mediated inhibition of mTOR pathway.

CaMKII is a general integrator of Ca2+ signaling,
which is activated by Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) complex
[41, 42]. To determine the role of CaMKII activity in
rotenone-induced neuronal apoptosis, PC12 cells and
primary neurons were exposed to 0-1 µM rotenone for
24 h. We found that rotenone induced phosphorylation of
CaMKII in a concentration-dependent manner in the cells
(Figure 3A). This was in agreement with decreased cell
viability (Figure 1B) or increased apoptosis (Figure S1B,
Figure 1C and 1D) in PC12 cells and primary neurons
induced by rotenone exposure, suggesting that rotenoneinduced neuronal apoptosis might involve induction of
CaMKII phosphorylation.
Next, we studied whether rotenone induces
phosphorylation of CaMKII is dependent on the level of

PC12 cells and primary neurons were treated with rotenone (0-1 μM) for 24 h. [Ca2+]i fluorescence intensity was imaged and quantified
using an intracellular Ca2+ indicator dye Fluo-3/AM (A). Cell viability was determined by the MTS assay (B) and cell apoptosis was
assayed using DAPI and TUNEL staining (C, D). A.-D. Rotenone concentration-dependently elicited [Ca2+]i elevation (A), and induced
viability reduction (B) and apoptosis (C, D) in PC12 cells and primary neurons. Results are presented as mean ± SE (n = 5). *P < 0.05, **P

[Ca2+]i. For this, PC12 cells and primary neurons were preincubated with/without BAPTA/AM (30 μM) or EGTA
(100 μM) for 1 h, and then treated with/without rotenone
(0.5 and 1 µM) for 24 h, respectively. As predicted,
chelating [Ca2+]i with BAPTA/AM or preventing [Ca2+]
elevation using EGTA obviously inhibited rotenonei
induced CaMKII phosphorylation in the cells (Figure
3B and 3C), indicating that rotenone-elevated [Ca2+]i
contributes to CaMKII phosphorylation.
To
determine
whether
rotenone-induced
phosphorylation of CaMKII contributes to inhibiting
mTOR pathway and inducing apoptosis in neuronal

cells, PC12 cells and primary neurons were pre-treated
with CaMKII inhibitor KN93 (10 µM) for 1 h, and then
exposed to rotenone (0.5 and 1 µM) for 24 h. We observed
that rotenone-induced phosphorylation of CaMKII was
obviously attenuated by KN93 in the cells (Figure 4A).
Of importance, rotenone-inhibited phosphorylation of
mTOR, S6K and 4E-BP1, as well as rotenone-activated
caspase-3 were markedly prevented by KN93 (Figure 4A).
Furthermore, KN93 also partially protected cell viability
(Figure S3A), and significantly suppressed rotenoneinduced nuclear fragmentation and condensation (Figure
4B).

were subjected to Western blotting using indicated antibodies (B, E). The blots were probed for β-tubulin as a loading control. Similar
results were observed in at least three independent experiments. Cell apoptosis was assayed using DAPI staining (C, F). A.-F. Pretreatment
with BAPTA/AM or EGTA significantly attenuated elevation of [Ca2+]i level (A, D) and inhibition of phosphorylation of mTOR, S6K1 and

Rotenone
evokes
Ca2+-CaMKII-dependent
induction of H2O2 overproduction in neuronal
cells

To verify the role of CaMKII in rotenone
suppression of mTOR pathway and neuronal apoptosis,
the expression of CaMKIIα was silenced by RNA
interference. As shown in Figure 4C, lentiviral shRNA
to CaMKIIα, but not to GFP, downregulated CaMKII
expression by ~90% in PC12 cells. Silencing CaMKII
obviously attenuated rotenone-induced phosphorylation
of CaMKII (Figure 4D), and conferred partial resistance
to rotenone-induced inhibition of phosphorylation of
mTOR, S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (Figure 4D). Consistently,
downregulation of CaMKII also attenuated rotenoneinduced cleavage of caspase-3 (Figure 4D), as well as cell
viability reduction (Figure S3B) and apoptosis (Figure
4E). The results clearly indicate that rotenone inhibits
mTOR signaling pathway and neuronal apoptosis by
elevating Ca2+-dependent CaMKII phosphorylation.

Recently we have demonstrated that rotenone elicits
H2O2 generation contributing to neuronal apoptosis [14].
In this study, we have noticed that rotenone-induced [Ca2+]
elevation results in apoptosis of PC12 cells and primary
i
neurons (Figures 1 and 2). Therefore, next we sought
to test whether rotenone-elevated [Ca2+]i contributes to
H2O2 production and consequential apoptosis. To this
end, PC12 cells and primary neurons were pretreated
with/without BAPTA/AM (30 µM) or EGTA (100 μM)
for 1 h, and then exposed to 0.5 and 1 µM rotenone
for 24 h, followed by imaging H2O2 fluorescence using

probed for β-tubulin as a loading control. Similar results were observed in at least three independent experiments. A. Rotenone resulted in

2′7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA),
a peroxide-selective probe [43]. The results showed that
rotenone induced a robust level of H2O2 (in green) in the
cells (Figure S4), in consistence with our recent findings
[14]. Interestingly, rotenone-induced H2O2 overproduction
was profoundly attenuated by BAPTA/AM (Figure S4) or
EGTA (data not shown) in the cells. Quantitative analyses
of the fluorescence intensities of H2O2 generation inhibited
by BAPTA/AM or EGTA are shown in Figure 5A and 5B.
Similarly, pretreatment with CaMKII inhibitor KN93 also

markedly diminished rotenone induction of H2O2 in PC12
cells and primary neurons (Figure 5C), implying that
CaMKII is involved in rotenone-induced H2O2 generation
in neuronal cells. This was further confirmed by the
observation that silencing CaMKII obviously reduced
rotenone-triggered H2O2 overproduction in PC12 cells
(Figure 5D). These data strongly suggest that rotenone
evokes Ca2+-CaMKII-dependent induction of H2O2
overproduction, leading to apoptosis in neuronal cells.

of mTOR, S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, cleavage of-caspase-3 (A) and apoptosis (B) in the cells induced by rotenone. C.-E. Lentiviral
shRNA to CaMKII, but not to GFP, down-regulated CaMKII expression by ~90% in PC12 cells (C), which obviously attenuated retononeinduced phosphorylation of CaMKII, and conferred partial resistance to rotenone-induced inhibition of mTOR signaling and activation of
caspase-3 (D), as well as apoptosis (E) in the cells. Results are presented as mean ± SE (n = 5). aP < 0.05, difference with control group; bP

Rotenone also induces mitochondrial H2O2dependent [Ca2+]i elevation activating CaMKII,

To gain more insights into the event that rotenone

neuronal cells [14]. This prompted us to postulate that
expression of mTOR-wt, S6K1-ca, or silencing 4E-BP1
may prevent rotenone-induced neuronal apoptosis by
inhibiting mitochondrial H2O2 and blocking Ca2+ signaling.
To test this concept, PC12 cells were infected with AdmTOR, Ad-S6K1-ca or Ad-GFP (as control), or with
lentiviral shRNA to 4E-BP1 or GFP, and then exposed to
rotenone (1 μM) for 24 h following pre-incubation with/
without CAT (350 U/ml), Mito-TEMPO (10 μM), BAPTA/
AM (30 μM) or EGTA (100 μM) for 1 h, respectively.
As expected, expression of mTOR-wt or S6K1-ca,
or silencing 4E-BP1 substantially blocked rotenoneinduced elevation of [Ca2+]i (Figure 7A and Figure S5A),
phosphorylation of CaMKII (Figure 7B and Figure S5B),
respectively. Consistently, rotenone-induced cleavage
of caspase-3 was apparently attenuated by expression of
mTOR-wt or S6K1-ca, or silencing 4E-BP1 (Figure 7B
and Figure S5B). Furthermore, expression of mTOR-wt
or S6K1-ca, or silencing 4E-BP1 also partially rescued
PC12 cells from apoptosis induced by rotenone (Figure
7C and Figure S5C). Of importance, addition of CAT,
Mito-TEMPO, BAPTA/AM or EGTA exhibited more
inhibitory effects on rotenone-induced phosphorylation of
CaMKII, inhibition of mTOR pathway, and induction of
apoptosis in the cells infected with Ad-mTOR, Ad-S6K1ca, or 4E-BP1 lentiviral shRNA than in Ad-GFP or GFP
shRNA control group (Figure 7A-7C and Figure S5A-C).
Collectively, our findings suggest that rotenone elevation
of mitochondrial H2O2- and [Ca2+]i-mediated CaMKII
phosphorylation inhibits mTOR-mediated S6K1 and 4E-

BP1 pathways, leading to neuronal apoptosis; activation
of mTOR pathway, in turn, can partially prevent rotenone
from increasing mitochondrial H2O2 and [Ca2+]i, thereby
attenuating rotenone-induced neuronal apoptosis.

DISCUSSION
Ca2+ signaling is an important component of signal
transduction pathways, which regulates a variety of
physiological responses of neurons to neurotransmitters
and neurotrophic factors, including cell survival
responses [16, 49]. Several previous studies have shown
that disturbances in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis trigger
synaptic dysfunction, impaired plasticity, and neuronal
degeneration such as PD, AD and HD [16-19]. Especially,
prolonged change in Ca2+ distribution in cells elicits a
set of biochemical cascades that lead to apoptosis [20,
21]. Rotenone, a broad-spectrum pesticide, has been
reported to disrupt [Ca2+]i homeostasis or induce [Ca2+]
elevation, leading to apoptosis in neuronal cells, such
i
as nigral dopaminergic neurons [45] and Neuro-2a cells
[37]. Our group has recently demonstrated that rotenone
inhibits mTOR-mediated S6K and 4E-BP1 pathways
leading to neuronal apoptosis [14, 36]. However, it is
not clear whether rotenone inhibits mTOR signaling
in Ca2+ dependent manner. Here, we provide evidence
that pretreatment with BAPTA/AM (an intracellular
Ca2+ chelator) or EGTA (an extracellular Ca2+ chelator)
significantly attenuated rotenone-induced elevation of
[Ca2+]i level, inhibition of mTOR pathway, and induction

pathway. Rotenone-induced [Ca2+]i elevation activates CaMKII, resulting in inhibition of mTOR-mediated S6K1 and 4E-BP1 pathways,
which are crucial for cell survival. Rotenone elicits Ca2+-CaMKII-dependent H2O2 overproduction, and reversely rotenone also induces
mitochondrial H2O2-dependent [Ca2+]i elevation activating CaMKII, thereby inhibiting mTOR signaling and inducing neuronal apoptosis.

of apoptosis in PC12 cells and primary neurons (Figure
2A-2F). The findings indicate that rotenone inhibition
of mTOR pathway, leading to neuronal apoptosis, is
attributed to [Ca2+]i elevation, which, at least, involves
extracellular Ca2+ influx, in neuronal cells in response to
rotenone.
CaMKII, a ubiquitously expressed multifunctional
Ser/Thr kinase, regulates the survival of neuronal cells
[33, 50-52]. It is activated upon binding of Ca2+/CaM
complex [41, 42]. As CaMKII is a general integrator
of Ca2+ signaling, we speculated that rotenone might
inhibit mTOR pathway and induce neuronal apoptosis by
elevating Ca2+-dependent CaMKII phosphorylation. In this
study, we found that 24-h exposure to rotenone increased
CaMKII phosphorylation concentration-dependently in
PC12 cells and primary neurons. Chelating intracellular
Ca2+ with BAPTA/AM obviously inhibited rotenoneinduced CaMKII phosphorylation in the cells, suggesting a
[Ca2+]i-dependent mechanism. To unveil whether CaMKII
activity is essential for rotenone-induced inhibition of
mTOR signaling contributing to neuronal apoptosis,
KN93, a specific inhibitor of CaMKII [53], was used. We
found that KN93 significantly blocked rotenone-induced
CaMKII phosphorylation, and effectively prevented
rotenone from inhibiting mTOR pathway and inducing
apoptosis in PC12 cells and primary neurons (Figure 4A
and 4B). Similar results were observed in the cells treated
with lentiviral shRNA to CaMKII (Figure 4C-4E). These
findings strongly support that CaMKII plays a bridging
role between rotenone-induced elevation of [Ca2+]
and inhibition of mTOR pathway, leading to neuronal
i
apoptosis.
Mitochondria play a crucial role in cellular Ca2+ and
redox homeostasis and apoptosis induction [20, 44]. In the
mitochondria, the respiratory chain complexes I and III are
the primary mitochondrial sources of univalent reduction
of O2 into superoxide (O2ˉ•) [20, 54]. Both SOD1 and
SOD2 can catalyze the dismutation of O2ˉ• into O2 and
H2O2 [55]. Of note, H2O2 takes place mainly at the most
vulnerable mitochondrial complex I [43]. For example,
H2O2 in mitochondria in situ in isolated nerve terminals
is sufficiently enhanced when mitochondrial complex
I is inhibited at a small degree [9]. Rotenone elicits
mitochondrial ROS/H2O2-dependent neuronal apoptosis
via inhibiting mitochondrial complex I [3, 4, 14]. In the
present study, we identified that rotenone evokes Ca2+CaMKII-dependent induction of H2O2 overproduction
in the mitochondria of neuronal cells. This is supported
by the findings that pretreatment with BAPTA/AM,
EGTA or KN93, or silencing CaMKII markedly reduced
H2O2 overproduction of neuronal cells in response to
rotenone (Figure S4 and Figure 5). Furthermore, TTFA
(a mitochondria complex II inhibitor) or Mito-TEMPO
(a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant) blocked rotenoneinduced mitochondrial H2O2 production, preventing [Ca2+]
elevation/CaMKII phosphorylation, mTOR inhibition
i

and neuronal apoptosis (Figure 6). Collectively, the above
findings suggest that rotenone induces mitochondrial
H2O2, resulting in elevation of [Ca2+]i, and rotenone, in
turn, evokes Ca2+-CaMKII-dependent overproduction of
H2O2 in neuronal cells, inhibiting mTOR signaling and
inducing neuronal apoptosis. Thus, there exists a crosstalk
between Ca2+ signaling and mitochondrial H2O2, which is
required for rotenone inhibition of mTOR signaling and
induction of neuronal cell death.
In this study, we also noticed that expression of
mTOR-wt or S6K1-ca, or silencing 4E-BP1 attenuated
rotenone-induced elevation of [Ca2+]i, phosphorylation of
CaMKII, and neuronal apoptosis (Figures 7 and Figure
S5). The results suggest that on one hand, rotenone induces
[Ca2+]i and mitochondrial H2O2, resulting in elevation of
inhibition of mTOR, and induction of neuronal apoptosis;
on the other hand, activation of mTOR pathway can, in
turn, partially prevent rotenone from increasing [Ca2+]i and
mitochondrial H2O2 and thus attenuating rotenone-induced
neuronal apoptosis. Currently we have no clue regarding
how mTOR regulates [Ca2+]i and mitochondrial H2O2 in
the cells in response to rotenone.
It has been known that many cell death stimuli alter
the level of Ca2+ in the cytosol and the storage of Ca2+
in the intracellular organelles [33, 56]. [Ca2+]i increase is
usually triggered by Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular
stores and/or Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space [15].
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is one of the major Ca2+
storage units in cells, and blockers of ER calcium channel,
such as IP3 receptors, can effectively prevent Ca2+ release
induced by various stimuli [15, 20]. The mitochondriaassociated ER membrane (MAM), a structure for
association of the mitochondria with the ER membrane,
can integrate signal transduction pathways to regulate
the communication and functional interactions between
the ER and mitochondrion, especially in Ca2+ exchanges
[20, 57]. Under pathological conditions, Ca2+ exchange
between mitochondria and ER mediated by MAM is
an important apoptotic control point [20]. Therefore,
it remains to be determined whether rotenone disrupts
Ca2+ homeostasis in the neuronal cells by increasing
[Ca2+]i elevation and/or decreasing [Ca2+]i clearance.
Understanding the underlying mechanisms may be helpful
to uncover why overexpression of mTOR-wt or S6K1ca or downregulation of 4E-BP1 suppresses rotenoneinduced [Ca2+]i elevation.
In summary, we have identified that rotenoneinduced [Ca2+]i elevation inhibits mTOR-mediated
S6K1 and 4E-BP1 pathways contributing to neuronal
apoptosis, through stimulating phosphorylation of
CaMKII. Rotenone-induced extracellular Ca2+ influx at
least plays an important role in contributing to neuronal
apoptosis. Rotenone elicits Ca2+-CaMKII-dependent
H2O2 overproduction, and reversely rotenone also induces
mitochondrial H2O2-dependent [Ca2+]i elevation activating
CaMKII, thereby inhibiting mTOR signaling and reducing

neuronal cell survival (i.e. inducing apoptosis) (Figure
8). Our findings highlight that the crosstalk between
Ca2+ signaling and mitochondrial H2O2 is required for
rotenone inhibition of mTOR pathway leading to neuronal
apoptosis. The findings suggest that how to control overelevation of intracellular Ca2+ and overproduction of
mitochondrial H2O2 may be a new strategy to fight against
the neurotoxicity of rotenone.
