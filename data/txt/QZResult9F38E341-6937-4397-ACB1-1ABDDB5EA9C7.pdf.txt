BACKGROUND: A phase 2 trial was conducted to determine the toxicity and efficacy of combined weekly topotecan
and biweekly bevacizumab in patients with primary or secondary platinum-resistant ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian
tube cancer (OC). METHODS: Patients were treated with bevacizumab 10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 and topotecan 4
mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle until progressive disease (PD) or excessive toxicity. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary objectives included overall survival (OS), objective response,
and toxicity. RESULTS: Patients (N ¼ 40) received a median of 8 treatment cycles. Toxicity was generally mild or
moderate, with neutropenia (18%), hypertension (20%), gastrointestinal toxicity (18%), pain (13%), metabolic toxicity
(15%), bowel obstruction (10%), and cardiotoxicity (8%) being the most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events. No
bowel perforations, febrile neutropenia, or treatment-related deaths occurred. Median PFS and OS were 7.8 (95%
confidence interval [CI], 3.0-9.4) and 16.6 months (95% CI, 12.8-22.9), with 22 (55%) patients progression-free for 6
months. Ten (25%) patients had partial response (PR), 14 (35%) had stable disease (SD), and 16 (40%) had PD.
Patients treated with 2 prior regimens received greater benefit than patients treated with 1: PR/SD, 78.9% versus
42.9% (P ¼ .03); median PFS, 10.9 versus 2.8 months (P ¼ .08); median OS, 22.9 versus 12.8 months (P ¼ .02).
CONCLUSIONS: A weekly topotecan and biweekly bevacizumab combination demonstrates acceptable toxicity and
encouraging efficacy in patients with platinum-resistant OC; further study is warranted. Cancer 2011;117:3731–40.

Most women with advanced ovarian cancer (OC) respond to first-line platinum and taxane chemotherapy.1 Overall,

only 20% to 40% of patients who receive current treatment options survive beyond 5 years after diagnosis of OC.2 The
majority of OC patients develop recurrent disease that becomes increasingly resistant to chemotherapy.3 Median survival
of patients with platinum-resistant OC is <12 months, and response rates to any subsequent chemotherapy are generally
lower compared with patients whose disease remains platinum-sensitive.
The targeted agent bevacizumab (Genentech, South San Francisco, California), a humanized monoclonal antibody
directed against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use

in multiple metastatic or advanced malignancies, including colorectal cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, breast
cancer, glioblastoma, and renal cell cancer.4 Bevacizumab
has also demonstrated significant antitumor activity in
patients with OC when used concurrently with standard
first-line platinum and taxane chemotherapy, when continued as maintenance in the treatment-naive setting,5,6
and when used as both a single agent7,8 and in combination with chemotherapy in recurrent OC.9 Bevacizumab
has also shown single-agent activity in endometrial10 and
cervical cancers.11
Topotecan (GlaxoSmithKline, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is a topoisomerase I inhibitor approved by regulatory agencies as a monotherapy for recurrent OC as an
intravenous infusion on days 1 through 5 of a 21-day
course.12 Recent studies show that weekly administration
of topotecan results in moderate efficacy in recurrent ovarian cancer with fewer cases of myelosuppression compared
with the 5-day regimen.13-17 In addition to having a direct
antitumor effect, topotecan may inhibit angiogenesis, as
suggested by in vitro18 and in vivo studies.19 The clinical
activity of bevacizumab and topotecan as monotherapies,
the potential for synergistic antiangiogenic effects, and
their nonoverlapping toxicity profiles provide compelling
rationale for combining these agents for the treatment of
patients with recurrent OC. Here, we present findings
from a prospective phase 2 study that evaluated the toxicity and efficacy of topotecan and bevacizumab in patients
with recurrent platinum-resistant OC.

retreatment with a second platinum-based therapy. Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) or CA-125 levels above 100 on 2 separate occasions (1 week or more apart) was required. Furthermore, patients had an estimated survival of 12 weeks
or longer; a Karnofsky performance status of 70% or
greater; adequate bone marrow, renal, and liver functions
by prespecified criteria; and signed informed consent.
Patients were excluded for prior treatment with an
antiangiogenesis agent, history of other malignancy
within 3 years (except for nonmelanoma skin cancer),
inadequately controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure above 150 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure
above 100 mm Hg), New York Heart Association class II
or greater congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction,
unstable angina, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or significant vascular disease within 6 months, or a history of
hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. Further exclusions included history of hemoptysis within 1
month, evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (for patients not on anticoagulation therapy), or
known central nervous system disease, except treated brain
metastases. Additional exclusion criteria were history of abdominal fistula, grade 4 bowel obstruction, gastrointestinal
perforation or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months,
current symptoms of GI obstruction grade 1 or greater,
major surgical procedure within 28 days, or minor surgical
procedure within 7 days of treatment, grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy, and serious nonhealing wound, active
ulcer, or untreated bone fracture.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study Design and Treatment Schedule
Treatment was administered in 28-day cycles, with intravenous bevacizumab 10 mg/kg given on days 1 and 15
and intravenous topotecan 4 mg/m2 given on days 1, 8,
and 15 (maximum topotecan dose of 8 mg). Treatment
was continued until progressive disease (PD) as defined
by RECIST, symptomatic deterioration related to
obvious clinical progression, excessive toxicity according
to prespecified criteria, toxicity requiring topotecan delay
of more than 2 weeks, or bevacizumab delay of more than
2 months, or topotecan-related toxicities requiring more
than 2 dose reductions. Dose reductions of bevacizumab
were not permitted. Bevacizumab was withheld for grade
2 or greater bowel obstruction or any grade 3 or greater
bevacizumab toxicity until recovery to grade 1. Criteria
for the discontinuation of bevacizumab included grade 4
bevacizumab-related toxicities, diagnosis of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, repeat grade 3

Patient Population
Following approval by the institutional review boards of
each site, the study was opened to patient accrual at the
Virginia Mason Medical Center and the Puget Sound
Oncology Consortium. Eligibility criteria included
advanced or recurrent epithelial ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. In an attempt to decrease the potential
for gastrointestinal perforation, our study population was
restricted to patients who had received a maximum of 2
prior chemotherapy regimens. All patients received prior
primary taxane and platinum-based chemotherapy, and
no more than 1 other chemotherapy regimen. Prior exposure to topotecan was acceptable, and subjects were at least
18 years old. Patients were required to have primary or
secondary platinum-resistant disease, defined as progression on platinum therapy, recurrence or persistence less
than 6 months after initial platinum therapy or after

hemorrhage, grades 2 to 4 pulmonary or central nervous
system hemorrhage, or any grade of arterial thrombosis,
gastrointestinal perforation, or wound dehiscence. Topotecan was withheld and reduced by 1 dose level (eg, 25%)
in the event of grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7
days, recurrent grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia,
grade 3 thrombocytopenia, recurrent grade 2 thrombocytopenia, grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy, grade
2 or greater renal toxicity, grade 3 or greater hepatic toxicity, or any grade 2 or greater toxicity impacting organ
function. For grades 2 and 3 neutropenia lasting more
than 7 days, dose reductions were allowed on a case-bycase basis. Topotecan was also withheld for an absolute
neutrophil count below 1200/lL and for thrombocytopenia (below 75,000/lL). Prophylactic oral antibiotics were
allowed to manage neutropenia at the discretion of the
treating physician. Per protocol, when topotecan was
withheld because of toxicity, the dose was delayed, and
the patient received all 3 weekly treatments over a longer
period of time. However, on occasion (at the request of
the patient or treating physician), the patient received
only 2 of the weekly treatments for a cycle before moving
on to the next cycle. Filgrastim or pegfilgrastim was
allowed with the next dose of chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating physician. When used, pegfilgrastim
was generally given after the third dose of chemotherapy
in the 2-week window between cycles. Erythropoietinstimulating agents were also allowed.
Toxicity and Efficacy Determinations
Patients receiving any study treatment were evaluable for
adverse events. Patients were evaluated clinically and with
standard laboratory tests at baseline and at regular intervals during the study. Patients discontinued from the
treatment phase of the study for any reason were evaluated
again approximately 30 days after discontinuing treatment. Safety assessments focused on tests designed to
detect known toxicities of bevacizumab, including blood
pressure monitoring, hemostasis evaluation, monitoring
of proteinuria by urinary protein:creatinine ratio or dipstick at least every 6 weeks, and close monitoring of GI
toxicity by the treating physician and principal investigator (K.F.M.). Toxicity related to either drug was assessed
by using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
Criteria, version 3.0.
Response in patients with measurable tumors was
assessed by modified Response Evaluation Criteria In
Solid Tumors (RECIST), which required that a complete
response (CR) also be characterized by a normalization of

CA-125 levels. In patients with nonmeasurable disease,
CA-125 levels were used to determine response according
to Rustin criteria.20 Progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) were defined as the number of
months after commencing study treatment until PD or
death, respectively.
Statistical Design and Analysis
This phase 2 trial was designed with PFS as the primary
endpoint; secondary objectives were OS, objective
response rate (ORR), and toxicity. The planned enrollment of 40 patients was determined assuming a median
PFS of 9 months (based on a median PFS of 7.2 months
for low-dose, metronomic cyclophosphamide plus bevacizumab in a phase 2 study9) and an analysis calculating the
sample size at which the narrowing of its 95% confidence
interval (CI) became greater than 0.20 for every 2 patients
added. PFS and OS were estimated by using the KaplanMeier method. For calculating the 95% CI of median
PFS and OS, a normal approximation was used that
assumed event times were exponentially distributed.
Standard statistical methods (chi-square, log-rank tests)
were used in post hoc analyses that compared efficacy parameters in patients who received 1 versus 2 prior treatment regimens and in patients with primary versus
secondary platinum resistance. All confidence intervals
were 2-sided, with an alpha level of .05. The log-rank and
chi-squared tests are 1-sided nondirectional tests. An
alpha level of .05 was used to define statistical significance
for these tests.

RESULTS
Patients
Forty patients were enrolled from August 2006 through
November 2008. The present analysis was performed on
data collected through January 31, 2010. At this date, 2
patients remained on study, and all patients were evaluable for toxicity and efficacy. Demographic information is
included in Table 1. All patients had been previously
treated with platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin) and a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel). One patient had received
topotecan, as part of consolidation therapy on a clinical
research protocol. Twenty-one (53%) patients had
received 1 prior chemotherapy regimen and were considered primary platinum-resistant. Of the 19 patients who
received 2 prior regimens, 7 were primary platinum-resistant and received second-line nonplatinum therapy before
enrollment on this study. Thus, 28 patients overall were

primary platinum-resistant. One patient had elevated
CA-125 without measurable disease, and the remaining
39 patients had measurable disease based on RECIST.
Treatment Exposure
Median duration on study was 33 weeks (range, 1-132
weeks), and patients received a median of 8 cycles of therapy (range, <1-32 cycles). Thirty-one patients went off
study as a result of PD: 21 by RECIST on CT scan, 7
because of general symptomatic deterioration, and 3
because of bowel obstruction. One patient received only 1

3734

weekly dose of study treatment and then went off study
because of rapidly progressing disease. Three patients
went off study because of toxicity: 1 for grade 3 proteinuria and recurrent thrombocytopenia and 2 for grade 4 cardiotoxicity. Four patients voluntarily withdrew from the
study after achieving partial response (PR) as best
response.
Safety and Tolerability
The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate
(Table 2). The most common grade 3 or 4 toxicities were
neutropenia (18%), hypertension (20%), GI toxicity
(18%), pain (13%), metabolic toxicity (16%), bowel
obstruction (10%), and cardiotoxicity (8%). Grade 4
events included cardiotoxicity (myocardial ischemia, 5%),
bowel obstruction (3%), anemia (3%), neutropenia (3%),
pain (3%), and hyponatremia (3%). The grade 4 cardiac
events were assessed as not related to the patients’ underlying cancer or study treatment. Two patients who had
medical risk factors for, but no history of, coronary artery
disease (CAD) developed myocardial ischemia after 8 and
24 cycles of treatment, respectively. The majority of grade
3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities were assessed to be
related to PD or underlying disease, including patients
with bowel obstruction, pain, and pulmonary/noninfectious toxicity, as well as a case of gonadal vein thrombosis.
Grade 3 fatigue, GI, and infectious and metabolic toxicities were possibly related to study treatment versus underlying disease. Twelve (30%) patients with grade 2 or 3
hypertension (grade 1 events were not recorded) and 3
cases of grade 2 or 3 proteinuria were likely related to bevacizumab. Early hypertension (within 3 months) was
observed in half of the patients with this toxicity (n ¼ 6).
There were no cases of bowel perforation, febrile neutropenia, or treatment-related death.
Overall, dose delays 7 days or longer occurred in 27
(68%) patients, and delays related to toxicity occurred in
22 (55%) patients. Twelve (30%) patients had dose delays
for reasons related to scheduling conflicts; 7 of these also
had 1 or more dose delays due to toxicity. Six (15%)
patients required 3 or more dose delays (range, 3-7 delays)
because of toxicity, and 5 (13%) patients had dose delays
for more than 14 days. Neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia prompted delays in 19 (48%) patients, and nonhematologic toxicities (eg, respiratory infection, fatigue,
hypertension) were the cause in 11 (28%) patients, 8 of
whom also experienced delays due to hematologic toxicity. The dose of topotecan was reduced by 25% in 4
patients because of hematologic toxicity. Three patients

achieved SD but then progressed at 7.1 months. Two
patients remained on study treatment—1 with SD, the
other with PR—after 21.1 and 30.3 months, respectively.
The patient with PR remains on study at the time of submission of this article(January 4, 2011) after 43 cycles and
41.3 months on treatment. The median PFS for the 13
other patients with SD was 8.6 months (range, 5.5-16.2
months), and all of these patients eventually progressed.
Only 2 of the patients with PR developed PD on study
treatment at 8.9 and 16.3 months, respectively. Seven
patients with PR withdrew from the study, 3 because of
toxicity and 4 by choice, after a median duration on study
of 12.1 months (range, 8.1-21.1 months).
Post hoc analysis showed that patients in this cohort
who received 2 prior regimens had improved outcomes

Figure 2. (A) Progression-free survival and (B) overall survival rates in patients with platinum-resistant OC treated with weekly
topotecan and biweekly bevacizumab, by number of prior regimens (N ¼ 40).

(see Table 3, Fig. 2A and 2B): PR/SD (disease control
rate) was 78.9% versus 42.9% (P ¼ .03); median PFS was
10.9 months versus 2.8 months (P ¼ .08); median OS was
22.9 months versus 12.8 months (P ¼ .02); and PFS at 6
months was 73.7% versus 38.1% (P ¼ .08). Similar trends
were observed with improved outcomes for patients with
secondary platinum-resistant compared with primary platinum-resistant disease, but these differences were much less
robust and not statistically significant (Table 3). There were
no differences in clinical outcomes (PR or SD vs PD) in
patients developing early hypertension compared with
patients without this toxicity.

DISCUSSION
Weekly topotecan and biweekly bevacizumab in combination demonstrated acceptable toxicity along with considerable activity in patients with platinum-resistant OC.

of 7.8 months and 16.6 months, respectively, with combined topotecan and bevacizumab are similar to outcomes
obtained in prospective studies of single-agent weekly topotecan,15,17 single-agent bevacizumab,7,8 and chemotherapy plus bevacizumab9 in patient populations with
generally lower proportions of platinum-resistant OC
(Table 4). In particular, the results of a previous phase 2
study combining low-dose metronomic cyclophosphamide with bevacizumab in 70 patients with recurrent OC
(ORR, 24%; median PFS, 7.2 months; median OS, 16.9
months) are remarkably similar to those reported here (see

Current study.

Table 4).9 However, only 40% of the patients treated
with cyclophosphamide and bevacizumab had platinumresistant disease compared with 100% in the current
study. Outcomes were improved in patients with platinum-sensitive disease—the median PFS was 7.9 versus
4.4 months, and median OS was 24.2 versus 11.4 months
for platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant disease,
respectively (personal communication with A. Garcia;
September, 2010). Thus, the results with topotecan
and bevacizumab appear to be favorable when restricted
to outcomes reported for patients with platinum-resistant
disease. Our data also compare favorably with studies
of chemotherapy in platinum-resistant OC, which
generally demonstrate a median PFS in the 3-month to
5-month range, and median OS between 11 months and
14 months.21-23 Preliminary results for bevacizumab
combined with liposomal doxorubicin in recurrent
OC have also been reported for 2 small phase 2
studies,24,25 with ORRs of 13% (2 of 15) and 36% (8 of
22). Overall, the similarity of results across prospective
single-arm studies suggests the need for randomized studies to delineate the relative benefits of chemotherapy, bevacizumab, and combination therapy in recurrent OC (see
Table 4).
In the current study, patients who received 2 prior
regimens had improved outcomes compared with those
who received only 1 prior regimen (see Table 3). To determine whether this benefit was related to the status of platinum resistance, another post hoc analysis was performed
to compare outcomes between patients with primary platinum-resistant disease and those with secondary platinum-resistant disease. The benefit appeared to be only
partly related to these characteristics, suggesting that a
subset of patients with relatively indolent disease and primary platinum-resistance may gain benefit from combined topotecan and bevacizumab.

The toxicity of this combination regimen generally
reflected the known safety profiles of both agents. With
the possible exception of hypertension, there was no evidence of synergistic toxicity. Consistent with the findings
of previous studies of weekly topotecan,13-17 grade 2
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia were common, whereas grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicities were
uncommon and generally manageable with dose delays or
dose reductions. Although dose delays occurred frequently, topotecan dose reductions were required in only
4 patients, and only 3 patients discontinued study treatment as a result of toxicity. Excluding hypertension and
proteinuria, the majority of grade 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities were assessed to be related to underlying
disease rather than to treatment. The absence of gastrointestinal perforation in the current study together with the
low rate of GI toxicity observed in the first-line phase 3
Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 0218 trial (grade
3 GI perforation, hemorrhage, or fistula in 2.3% to
2.6% of bevacizumab-treated patients)5 support the conclusion that heavily pretreated patients appear to be at a
higher risk of gastrointestinal perforation while receiving
bevacizumab.26-29
Although effectively managed with supportive medication, the incidence (20%) of grade 3 hypertension
observed with this combination regimen was higher than
the 9% to 10% rate observed with single-agent bevacizumab in recurrent OC7,8; however, it was similar to that
(15.7%) reported for low-dose metronomic cyclophosphamide plus bevacizumab.9 It has been suggested that
higher rates of hypertension occur when cytotoxic agents
with potential antiangiogenic activity are combined with
bevacizumab.30 A number of reports have also suggested a
possible correlation between the development of hypertension and improved clinical outcome with bevacizumab31,32; however, a rigorous analysis of data from phase

3 trials in multiple solid tumors identified that early
hypertension was not predictive of PFS or OS benefit
with bevacizumab in most trials.33 The significance of our
observation that response did not differ according to the
occurrence of hypertension is limited by the small number
of patients under evaluation.
In conclusion, the combination of weekly topotecan
and biweekly bevacizumab provides very good efficacy
with acceptable toxicity in patients with platinum-resistant OC, although randomized trials are needed to determine the relative clinical benefit of single-agent versus
combined regimens in this treatment setting. Our results
further suggest that patients who progress quickly on platinum therapy may not be the best candidates for this therapeutic combination and that patients whose disease is
more indolent appear to gain substantial clinical benefit.
Further investigation of this regimen in platinum-resistant OC is warranted.
