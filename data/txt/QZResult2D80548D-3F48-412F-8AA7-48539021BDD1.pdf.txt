Abstract
The pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBD) are naturally occurring antitumor antibiotics, and a PBD dimer (SJG-136,
SG2000) is in phase II trials. Many potent PBDs contain a C2-endo-exo unsaturated motif associated with the
pyrrolo C-ring. The novel compound SG2202 is a PBD dimer containing this motif. SG2285 is a water-soluble
prodrug of SG2202 in which two bisulfite groups inactivate the PBD N10-C11 imines. Once the bisulfites are
eliminated, the imine moieties can bind covalently in the DNA minor groove, forming an interstrand crosslink. The mean in vitro cytotoxic potency of SG2285 against human tumor cell lines is GI50 20 pmol/L. SG2285
is highly efficient at producing DNA interstrand cross-links in cells, but they form more slowly than those
produced by SG2202. Cellular sensitivity to SG2285 was primarily dependent on ERCC1 and homologous recombination repair. In primary B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples, the mean LD50 was significantly
lower than in normal age-matched B and T lymphocytes. Antitumor activity was shown in several human
tumor xenograft models, including ovarian, non–small cell lung, prostate, pancreatic, and melanoma, with
cures obtained in the latter model with a single dose. Further, in an advanced-stage colon model, SG2285
administered either as a single dose, or in two repeat dose schedules, was superior to irinotecan. Our findings
define SG2285 as a highly active cytotoxic compound with antitumor properties desirable for further development. Cancer Res; 70(17); 6849–58. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBD) are a family of naturally occurring antitumor antibiotics produced by
Streptomyces species (1). The PBD monomers, which include anthramycin and sibiromycin, exert their biological
activity by binding in the minor groove of DNA with a selectivity for 5′-purine-G-purine sequences, forming a covalent bond to the exocyclic amino group of the guanine
base (2). PBD dimers have been designed and synthesized
by joining two monomer PBD units together through their
C8-positions through a flexible linker (3–7). This has resulted in molecules capable of recognizing longer se-

quences of DNA (e.g., 5′-purine-GATC-pyrimidine; see
Supplementary Material Section S1) and producing highly
cytotoxic, nondistorting DNA interstrand cross-links in
the DNA minor groove (8–11). One such dimer, SJG-136
(SG2000; Fig. 1A), was shown to have significant in vitro
and in vivo antitumor activity (11, 12). It has recently completed phase I clinical trials in the United Kingdom
(through Cancer Research UK; ref. 13) and in the United
States (through National Cancer Institute; refs. 14, 15), and is
about to enter phase II studies against both solid tumors
and hematologic malignancies.
Many of the most potent naturally occurring PBD
monomers have endo-exo unsaturation at the C2 position. Synthetic PBD monomers that retain this motif have established
that C2 unsaturation enhances in vitro potency (16). This finding has now been applied to PBD dimers with the synthesis of
SG2202 (ref. 17; Fig. 1A) where two PBD monomer units, which
retain the endo-exo unsaturation motif in the form of a C2-aryl
substituent conjugated to a 2,3 double bond, are joined
through their C8/C8′ positions through a propyldioxy linker.
This molecule had significantly greater in vitro cytotoxicity
(17) compared with the C2-unsaturated parent molecule
(DSB-120; ref. 8) or with SJG-136 (11). The additional C2/C2′-aryl
substituents, however, lowered water solubility to a level that
made further development of this compound challenging.

Figure 1. A, structures of SJG-136 (SG2000), SG2202, and SG2285. SG2285 is shown in the 11S,11′R and 11S,11S′ diastereomeric forms. B, scheme of
SG2202 binding across 8 bp in the DNA sequence 5′-XAGATCTX-3′, forming a DNA interstrand cross-link between guanine N2 groups spanning 4 bp.
C, molecular model of SG2202 binding in the DNA minor groove.

Therefore, SG2202 was converted into the C11/C11′ bisulfite adduct resulting in SG2285 (Fig. 1A; ref. 17), whereby the
two bisulfite groups inactivate the N10-C11 imines of the
PBD units. The prodrug exists in two predominant diastereomer forms, 11S,11′R and 11S,11S′ (Fig. 1A). Once the bisulfite
groups are eliminated to produce SG2202, the two PBD imine
moieties are able to bind covalently in the minor groove of
DNA to the N2 positions of guanine on opposite strands of
DNA to form an interstrand cross-link (Fig. 1B). SG2285 is
freely water soluble and stable in aqueous conditions, retaining the in vitro potency of SG2202 (17). Using plasmid
DNA in an agarose gel electrophoresis assay, SG2285 was
found to be a highly efficient DNA interstrand cross-linking
agent (17). Cross-links, however, formed more slowly than
those produced by the parent molecule SG2202, reaching a
peak at 2 hours for SG2202 and >18 hours for SG2285, confirming that it behaves as a prodrug.
The current study documents the in vitro activity of
SG2285 and confirms its DNA interstrand cross-linking ability in human tumor cells. Potent activity in primary B-cell
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL; both from untreated
and previously treated patients) and apoptosis induction
through the intrinsic pathway are shown. In addition, potent
antitumor activity is shown against a wide range of in vivo
human solid tumor xenograft models using different dosing

schedules, providing a clear rationale for further preclinical
development of this novel agent.

Materials and Methods
Drugs
SG2202 and prodrug SG2285 were synthesized as previously described (17). Different batches of SG2285 containing
different 11S,11′R and 11S,11S′ diastereomeric ratios were
used in the current study. The ratios of 11S,11S′ to 11S,11′R
for batches 2 to 5 are 1:1.87, 1:5.1, 26.5:1, and 1:9, respectively.
The ratio for batch 1 was not determined.
Cell lines
All human tumor cell lines were obtained between 2003
and 2008 from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)
or the European Collection of Cell Cultures, with the exception of LOX-IMVI and OVCAR-5, which were obtained
in 2004 from the Developmental Therapeutics Program,
National Cancer Institute.
The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) AA8, UV23, UV47, UV61,
and UV96 cell lines were obtained in 1998 from Dr. M. Stefanini
(Istituto di Genetica Biochemica et Evoluzionistica, Pavia,
Italy). V79, irs1, irs1SF, CHO-K1, and xrs5 cell lines were kindly
provided in 1998 by Prof. J. Thacker (MRC Radiation and

Genome Stability Unit, Harwell, United Kingdom). UV135 was
obtained in 1998 from ATCC (no. CRL-1867).
All cell lines were kept at low passage, returning to original
frozen stocks every 3 to 6 months, and tested regularly for
Mycoplasma. The lines have not been reauthenticated since
receipt.
Growth inhibition assays
For growth inhibition assays in human tumor cell lines, a
190-μL cell suspension was added to each well of a 96-well
plate (hematologic lines at 5 × 104 cells/mL; all other lines at
1 × 104 cells/mL). Following drug addition, plates were incubated for four control cell doublings. Following incubation
(with the exception of OVCAR-5 and HT29 cells), Alamar
blue, which stains living cells, was added to each well to a
final concentration of 1 μmol/L. For OVCAR-5 and HT29,
MTT solution to a final concentration of 1.5 μmol/L was
added to each well. Plates were then incubated for a further
4 hours, with the exception of U266B1 cells (5 hours) and
HCT-8 cells (2 hours) at 37°C. Plates were read using an
Envision plate reader, data were analyzed using GraphPad
Prism, and GI50 values were obtained.
Studies in CHO cells were performed using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay as previously described (18).
Measurement of DNA interstrand cross-linking in cells
using the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay
Exponentially growing DU145 cells were plated onto
2 × 6-well plates at 3× 104/mL (2 mL/well) and incubated
at 37°C overnight to allow the cells to adhere. The following
day, the medium was removed and replaced with serumfree medium containing SG2285 at 1 nmol/L. The plates
were then incubated at 37°C and cells were harvested at
0, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 hours. The cells were stored at
−80°C until assayed for cross-linking using the modified
single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay as previously
described (19, 20).
Comets were analyzed using a Nikon inverted fluorescent microscope and Kinetic Imaging software (KOMET
version 4). The tail moments (TM) of 25 cells per slide were
measured, and the mean tail moment of duplicate slides was
calculated. The mean resultant TM (Res TM) for each dose
was calculated as TM of irradiated cells − TM of unirradiated
cells. The percentage decrease in TM was calculated by the
following equation:
% decrease in TM = [1 – (Res TM of drug treated/
Res TM control)] × 100
Studies in B-CLL
Peripheral blood samples from 20 patients with B-CLL were
obtained with the patients' informed consent. B-CLL was
defined by clinical criteria as well as cellular morphology
and the coexpression of CD19 and CD5 in lymphocytes simultaneously displaying restriction of light-chain rearrangement.
None of the previously treated patients (n = 10) had received
therapy for at least 2 months before this study.

www.aacrjournals.org

Freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes from B-CLL
patients and normal age-matched controls as well as acute myelogenous leukemia cell lines (1 × 106/mL) were cultured in
RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/mL
penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum.
Cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified 5% carbon dioxide
atmosphere in the presence of SG2285 (10−10–10−7 mol/L)
for time points up to 48 hours. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and then resuspended in 195 μL of calcium-rich
buffer. Subsequently, 5 μL of Annexin V (Caltag Medsystems)
was added to the cell suspension and cells were incubated
in the dark for 10 minutes before washing. Cells were finally
resuspended in 190 μL of calcium-rich buffer together with
10 μL of propidium iodide. Apoptosis was assessed by
dual-color immunofluorescent flow cytometry.
To measure SG2285-induced caspase-3 activation, cells
were harvested by centrifugation and labeled with CD19
APC-conjugated antibody. Subsequently, the cells were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C in the presence of the PhiPhiLux
G1D2 substrate (Calbiochem), which contains two fluorophores separated by a quenching linker sequence that is cleaved
by active caspase-3. Once cleaved, the resulting products fluoresce green and can be quantified using flow cytometry. In additional experiments, the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK or
the caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK (Cambridge Bioscience)
were added to SG2285-treated cell cultures (final concentration
2 μmol/L) to determine whether either of these inhibitors was
able to abrogate the apoptotic effects of SG2285 in CLL cells.
Data were evaluated using the Student's t test or MannWhitney test, and correlation coefficients were calculated
from least-squares linear regression plots. Drug sensitivity
was evaluated using nonlinear regression and line of best-fit
analysis of the sigmoidal dose-response curves. All statistical
analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 3.0 software.
In vivo studies
LOXIMVI melanoma and OVCAR-5 ovarian tumors.
United Kingdom Coordinating Committee on Cancer
Research guidelines for the welfare of animals in experimental neoplasia were adhered to throughout the study.
Tumor fragments of less than 3 mm were implanted subcutaneously into the left or right flanks of the mice, and tumor growth was monitored as the relative tumor volume
(RTV). Tumor volume was calculated using the formula tumor volume = (w2 × l)/2, where w is the width and l the
length of the tumor. RTV was calculated using the formula
RTV = tumor volume day n/tumor volume day 0. Animals
were sorted into treatment groups with mean tumor volumes
of 64 mm3.
SG2285 was administered intravenously (i.v.) as a single dose,
in volumes of 0.1 mL per 10 g body weight. Control groups received vehicle only. Percentage tumor growth delay (%TGD)
was calculated using the formula %TGD = [time (days) taken
to reach end point (treatment group) − time (days) taken to
reach end point (control group)]/time (days) taken to reach
end point (control group) × 100. The end point was defined
as the tumor reaching 17 mm in length. Treatment outcome
was evaluated by %TGD and complete regression (CR).

Advanced LS174T colon and SKOV-3 ovarian tumors.
LS174T xenografts were initiated from tumors maintained
in nu/nu mice. SK-OV-3 xenografts were initiated from tumors maintained in severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID) mice. Tumor fragments of 1 mm were implanted subcutaneously into the right flanks of test mice (nu/nu for
LS174T and SCID for SK-OV-3). The Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines for animal care and use were adhered to throughout
the study. Animals were sorted into treatment groups with
mean tumor volumes of 323 to 326 mm3 (LS174T) and 99.9
to 100 mm3 (SK-OV-3). Compound in 5% dimethylacetamide
(DMA)/95% physiologic saline was administered at various
dosing regimens, in volumes of 0.1 mL per 10 g body weight.
For LS174T, one group received irinotecan intraperitoneally
(i.p.) weekly (qwk) × 3. Control groups received vehicle only.
The end point was defined as the tumors reaching 1,500 mm3
or 69 days for LS174T and 2,000 mm3 or 79/120 days for SKOV-3. Treatment outcome was evaluated by %TGD and CR.
LS174T colon, A549 non–small cell lung carcinoma, PC3
prostate, and Bx-PC-3 pancreatic tumors. LS174T, PC3, and
Bx-PC-3 xenografts were initiated from tumors maintained in
nu/nu mice. A549 xenografts were initiated from cultured
cells maintained in Kaighn's modified Ham's F12 medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL
penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin sulfate, 25 μg/mL gentamicin, 2 mmol/L glutamine, and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate.
Tumor fragments of 1 mm were implanted subcutaneously
into the right flanks of test mice. For A549 xenografts, cells
were harvested during log phase and resuspended in 50%
Matrigel matrix (BD Biosciences) at 5 × 107 cells/mL. Each
mouse was injected subcutaneously in the right flank with
1 × 107 cells (0.2-mL cell suspension).
Animals were sorted into treatment groups with mean tumor volumes of 99 to 100 mm3 (LS174T), 128 to 130 mm3
(A549), 106 to 107 mm 3 (PC3), and 105 to 107 mm 3
(Bx-PC-3). SG2285 in 33% propylene glycol/5% dextrose
was administered at various dosing regimens, in volumes
of 0.1 mL per 10 g body weight. For LS174T, one group received irinotecan at 100 mg/kg (i.p.) qwk × 3 and one group
received 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) at 100 mg/kg, i.p. qwk × 3. For
A549, one group received docetaxel at 30 mg/kg, i.v. every
4 days (q4d) × 3. For PC3, one group received paclitaxel at
30 mg/kg i.v. every other day (qod) × 5 and one group received cisplatin at 10 mg/kg i.p. qwk × 3. For Bx-PC-3, one
group received paclitaxel at 30 mg/kg i.v. qod × 5. Control
groups received vehicle only. The end point was defined as
the tumor reaching 2,000 mm3 in the control group or
26 days (LS174T), 29 days (A549), and 30 days (Bx-PC-3).
For PC3, the study was terminated at 30 days. Treatment
outcome was evaluated by % tumor growth inhibition (%
TGI) and partial regression (PR). %TGI was calculated using
the formula %TGI = [(median final tumor volumecontrol −
median final tumor volume treated )/median final tumor
volumecontrol)] × 100. An agent that produced at least 60%
TGI was considered to be potentially therapeutically active.
PR was indicated by tumor volumes 50% or less than the
volume at day 1 of treatment.

Results
SG2285 is the C11/C11′ bisulfite adduct prodrug of SG2202
that exists in two main diastereomeric forms, 11S,11′R and
11S,11S′ (Fig. 1A). The active drug spans 8 bp in the minor groove
of DNA (Fig. 1C), forming interstrand cross-links between
guanine N2 positions spanning 4 bp as depicted in Fig. 1B.

each cell line relative to the mean of all cell line responses is depicted
by a horizontal bar extending either to the right (more sensitive) or to the
left (less sensitive) of the mean (vertical line). The length of each bar is
proportional to the cell line sensitivity relative to the mean. B, DNA

Activity of SG2285 in vitro
The in vitro activity of SG2285 was determined following
continuous exposure in a panel of human tumor cell lines
(Fig. 2A). The average GI50 across the panel was 20 pmol/L,
range 0.3 pmol/L (HL-60) to 68 nmol/L (HCT-15). These data
confirm the potent in vitro activity of SG2285 against both hematologic and solid tumor cell lines. In addition, the 104 range
in GI50 values among the cell lines suggests that this agent confers a multilog, differential effect upon cell lines rather than
exerting a nonspecific cytotoxicity. (For a comparison with
other DNA cross-linking agents, see Supplementary Material
Section S2, Table S1.)
The activity of SG2285 was also determined in a panel of
CHO cell lines with defined defects in specific DNA repair
pathways (Table 1). Cell lines defective in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes XPB, XPG, XPF, and CSB showed a
modest increase in sensitivity (1.2- to 3.2-fold) over wild-type
cells. Cells defective in the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ)
Ku 70 subunit (XRCC5) showed no increased sensitivity. In
contrast, cells defective in the NER factor ERCC1 showed a
12.1-fold increased sensitivity to SG2285. In addition, cells defective in the RAD51 paralogues XRCC2 and XRCC3 were highly
sensitive to SG2285, with 16.7- and 10.9-fold increased sensitivities, respectively. These data suggest that cellular sensitivity of the minor groove cross-linking agent SG2285 is
dependent on ERCC1 and homologous recombination repair.
DNA interstrand cross-linking by SG2285 in cells
We have previously shown SG2285 to efficiently cross-link
naked DNA (17), with the cross-links forming more slowly
than with SG2202. DNA interstrand cross-linking was determined in the human prostate cancer cell line DU145 treated
with 1 nmol/L SG2285 using the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay (Fig. 2B). Cross-links form slowly, with none
evident in the initial 4 hours. A significant level of cross-linking
was observed at 8 hours, which was still increasing at 32 hours.
This is in contrast to other PBD dimers such as SJG-136 in

www.aacrjournals.org

which cross-links form rapidly in cells, with the majority forming within the first few hours of exposure (11). These data are
therefore consistent with SG2285 acting as a prodrug, slowly
releasing the highly potent cross-linking agent SG2202.
Study of SG2285 in primary B-CLL cells
In vitro drug sensitivity was measured in 20 primary B-CLL
samples using the Annexin V/propidium iodide assay, and
LD50 values were calculated. Apoptosis was induced in all
20 patient samples following exposure to SG2285 with a
mean LD50 value (±SD) of 8.3 (±3.4) × 10−9 mol/L (Fig. 3A)
and LD90 value of 4.6 (±2.4) × 10−8 mol/L. Normal B and
T lymphocytes from 10 age-matched controls showed higher
LD50 values than the B-CLL cells (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001,
respectively; Fig. 3A). This difference was not observed with
the cross-linking agent chlorambucil, for which the normal
cells were found to be more sensitive (Fig. 3A)
The development of drug resistance in B-CLL is associated
with previous treatment and is often pleiotropic in nature
(21). In this study, we compared SG2285 LD50 values between
previously treated (n = 10) and untreated (n = 10) patient
groups (Fig. 3B). There was a trend toward increased resistance to SG2285 in the previously treated group, but this did
not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07), whereas the increase was significant with chlorambucil (P = 0.003).
Aliquots of B-CLL cells were exposed to 5 or 10 nmol/L
SG2285 for up to 72 hours. Apoptosis induction was doserelated and increased significantly between 36 and 48 hours,
and was still increasing at 72 hours (Fig. 3C). DNA interstrand
cross-linking in B-CLL cells was evaluated at 2 nmol/L. Consistent with the apoptosis induction, and the data in Fig. 2B,
cross-links formed slowly and were only evident after 8 hours,
and still increasing at 48 hours (see Supplementary Material
Section S3; Fig. S1).
To elucidate the exact caspase activation pathway that
SG2285 uses in B-CLL cell killing, a series of experiments
were performed using caspase inhibitors to evaluate their

ability to block SG2285-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3D). The pan
caspase inhibitor Z-VAD.fmk at a concentration of 2 μmol/L
significantly inhibited the cytotoxic effects of SG2285. The
caspase-9 inhibitor (LEHD.fmk) also caused a reduction in
SG2285-induced apoptosis at a final concentration of 2 μmol/L;
however, the caspase-8 inhibitor (IETD.fmk) had little
cytoprotective effect as shown in Fig. 3D. Therefore, SG2285
induces apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
Antitumor activity of SG2285 in vivo
The antitumor activity of SG2285 was evaluated in a range
of human tumor xenograft models using different i.v. dosing
schedules. Representative experiments are shown in Fig. 4,
and data from all experiments are summarized in Tables 2
and 3. In an early-stage melanoma LOX-IMVI, which was
previously shown to be sensitive to SJG-136 (11), a single administration of SG2285 at 3 mg/kg gave seven of seven tumorfree survivors at the end of the study period (day 68; Fig. 4A;
Table 2). A further study gave eight of eight tumor-free survivors at day 86, with single doses of 1.5 and 0.75 mg/kg giving
six of eight and four of eight tumor-free survivors, respectively.
Activity was also observed in the ovarian OVCAR-5 model following a single administration of 3 mg/kg (% TGD = 59),
although no tumor-free survivors or CRs were seen in this
model (Table 2).
In an advanced LS174T colon model (mean tumor volume
>300 mm3 at start of treatment), SG2285 was also effective
following a single administration of 4 mg/kg (Fig. 4B), giving
%TGD of 138 (Table 2). Improved efficacy was observed using
repeated schedules of 1.5 mg/kg q4d × 3 or 0.8 mg/kg daily
(qd) × 5 (Fig. 4B), giving %TGD values of 219 and 202, respectively. In this model, SG2285 was considerably more effica-

cious than irinotecan at a standard dose of 100 mg/kg i.p.
qwk × 3 (%TGD = 54; Fig. 4B). In the SKOV-3 ovarian cancer
model, SG2285 was highly effective using a q4d × 3 schedule
at doses of 0.5, 0.25, and 0.1 mg/kg (Fig. 4C), giving %TGD
values of 325, 309, and 325, respectively (Table 2). At the
top dose, eight of nine of the animals were still alive at the
end of the experiment (120 days). In contrast, with the standard agent cisplatin at 8 mg/kg qwk × 3, all animals had to be
sacrificed by day 92 (Fig. 4C). Further experiments in this
model confirmed the potent activity of SG2285 using both
a q4d × 3 schedule and a qd × 5 schedule with tumor-free
survivors observed at 0.375 and 1.5 mg/kg (q4d × 3) and
0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg (qd × 5; Table 2). Comparison in this model
between different batches of drug containing different
11S,11′R and 11S,11S′ diastereomer ratios ranging from
1:1.87 (batch 2) to 26.5:1 (batch 4) confirmed activity in all
cases (Table 2).
Significant activity was also observed in a series of shorterduration in vivo experiments (26–30 days) using 100 mm3
tumors (Table 3). SG2285 at 0.85 and 1 mg/kg qd4 × 3
was superior to irinotecan (100 mg/kg qwk × 3 i.p.) and
5-FU (100 mg/kg qwk × 3 i.p.) in the LS174T colon model.
SG2285 (1 mg/kg q4d × 3), although producing a significant
tumor growth delay, was less active than docetaxel (30 mg/kg
qwk × 3) in the non–small cell lung cancer model A549
(%TGI 63 and 89, respectively). In the PC3 prostate model,
SG2285 gave 5 of 10 and 4 of 10 PRs at 0.75 q4d × 4 and
1.0 mg/kg q4d × 3, respectively, which was superior to cisplatin (10 mg/kg qwk × 3 i.p., no PRs) but less active than
paclitaxel (30 mg/kg qod × 5, 8 of 10 PRs). Finally, SG2285
gave PRs in the Bx-PC-3 prostate cancer model, whereas
none was seen with paclitaxel.

Discussion
SG2202 is the first example of a C2/C2′-aryl PBD dimer
that has been converted to a stable, highly water soluble

www.aacrjournals.org

prodrug form (SG2285) by conversion to C11/C11′-bisulfite
diastereomers. SG2285 retains the in vitro potency of
SG2202 (17). The formation of DNA interstrand cross-links
by SG2285 is significantly delayed compared with SG2202

Hartley et al.

both in naked DNA (17) and in intact cells. In both cases, a
similar level of cross-linking is eventually achieved, consistent with SG2285 acting as a prodrug and releasing the
bisulfite groups to provide a slow conversion to the active
PBD dimer SG2202.
SG2285 is more potent in vitro than SJG-136, the first PBD
dimer to enter clinical trials. For example, the mean GI50 in
the panel of human tumor cell lines (Fig. 2) was 20 pmol/L
compared with 7.4 nmol/L for SJG-136 in the NCI 60 cell line
panel (11). Consistent with this increased potency is the ∼50fold lower concentration of SG2285 required to produce an
equivalent level of DNA interstrand cross-linking in cells.
The data obtained in the panel of DNA repair–defective
CHO mutants indicated that sensitivity to SG2285 was primarily dependent on ERCC1 and homologous recombination
(XRCC2 and XRCC3; refs. 22–25). With conventional crosslinking agents such as nitrogen mustards and platinum
drugs, the XPF-ERCC1–specific nuclease has been shown
to play a critical role in repair or “unhooking” of interstrand
cross-links both in cell-free systems and in cells (26–28). We
have previously shown in the same panel of cell lines that
sensitivity to SJG-136 was increased 7.5-fold in both XPFand ERCC1-defective cells (18). Interestingly, for SG2285,
the level of sensitivity in ERCC1 (12.1-fold) was much higher
than for XPF (3.1-fold), suggesting a greater dependence on
ERCC1. This has not been observed previously for other

cross-linking agents. Consistent with other cross-linking
agents, however, including SJG-136, is the highly increased
sensitivity (11- and 17-fold) of SG2285 in XRCC2 and XRCC3
cells, confirming the importance of homologous recombination repair in the processing of unhooked and resectioned
interstrand cross-links (18, 27–29).
Potent in vitro activity was also confirmed in primary BCLL samples with an LD50 value more than 2 logs lower than
fludarabine, the current treatment choice for this condition,
and lower than SJG-136 (30). Importantly, SG2285 exhibited
significant differential apoptotic activity (by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway) between normal B and T lymphocytes, and
B-CLL cells. In addition, leukemic cells isolated from previously treated patients were not more resistant to SG2285
compared with those isolated from treatment-naïve patients.
Taken together, these data indicate that SG2285 might be a
useful option for the treatment of this hematologic malignancy, which remains incurable with a median survival
for advanced-stage patients of only 3 years (31).
SG2285 was found to be a highly active antitumor agent
in vivo, with activity observed in all models tested. CRs and
tumor-free survivors were observed in the LOX-IMVI melanoma and SKOV-3 ovarian models, and tumor regressions
in the PC3 prostate and Bx-PC-3 pancreatic models, representing hard-to-treat cancers, following single cycles of treatment. Significant and long-lasting tumor growth delays were

observed in the other models tested, including an advanced
LS174T colon model in which increases in life span of
>40 days and superior activity to the standard drug irinotecan were achieved. Activity was observed in single i.v. and
repeat dose (q4d × 3 and qd × 5) schedules. All studies tested
a single cycle of treatment, and there is clearly the potential
for increased activity with repeated treatment cycles. In comparison with irinotecan, it is interesting to note that both
compounds covalently link to bases on opposite DNA strands
with a 4-bp stagger.
The delivery of the PBD dimer SG2202 as a prodrug has resulted in an agent (SG2285) with very different cellular and animal pharmacokinetic properties to SJG-136. Interestingly,
despite the active cross-linking agent SG2202 being considerably more potent than SJG-136, the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) of prodrug SG2285 in mice is ∼10-fold higher than for
SJG-136. In LOX-IMVI and OVCAR-5, direct comparisons can
be made between SG2285 and SJG-136, and in both cases
SG2285 gave superior activity. For example, under the identical conditions used for SG2285 shown in Fig. 4A, SJG-136 was
highly active but produced cures in only four of eight animals
at its MTD (0.3 mg/kg), whereas SG2285 cured all animals
(eight of eight) at 3 mg/kg, six of eight animals at 1.5 mg/kg,
and four of eight at 0.75 mg/kg. In the case of OVCAR-5, a single administration of SJG-136 at its MTD produced only a minimal growth delay, whereas SG2285 gave a significant tumor
growth delay (Table 2). The data suggest that the delivery of a
highly active PDB as a prodrug can result in an increased therapeutic index in vivo.
The diastereomeric ratio of SG2285 was found to be very
sensitive to its method of synthesis, work-up, and purifica-

tion. For example, one set of conditions affords almost exclusively the 11S,11S′ diastereomer (26.5:1 11S,11S′ to 11S,11′R
ratio), whereas different conditions can produce a 9:1 mixture in favor of the 11S,11'R diastereomer (17). Importantly,
the ratio of C11/C11′ diastereomers does not seem to influence in vitro cytotoxicity of SG2285 (data not shown). The
present study also shows that batches of drug with 11S,11S′
to 11S,11′R ratios ranging from 26.5:1 to 1:5.1 retain potent
in vivo antitumor activity.
In summary, SG2285 is a novel C2-aryl-substituted PBD dimer prodrug with potent activity in vitro against human tumor cell lines and primary B-CLL cells, and in vivo against a
wide range of human tumors, including those difficult to treat
clinically. As a result of this impressive activity, SG2285 is in
preclinical development toward phase I clinical trials.
