BACKGROUND: Complete response (CR) at the primary tumor site as assessed by clinical examination following induction chemotherapy with PF (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) is a favorable predictive factor for overall survival and disease control in patients
with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. In most series, the rate of CR at the primary site after induction
PF was 20% to 30%. This study evaluated the efficacy and feasibility of induction nab-paclitaxel and cetuximab given with PF (ACPF)
followed by definitive chemoradiation (CRT) in a phase 2 trial. METHODS: Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
neck were treated with ACPF (nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2/week; cetuximab 250 mg/m2/week; cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1; 5-FU 750
mg/m2/day on days 1 through 3) every 21 days for 3 cycles followed by CRT (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 22, and 43 of radiation
therapy [RT]). CR at the primary tumor site after 2 cycles of ACPF was the primary endpoint. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled,
of which 22 (73%) had large (T3/T4) primary tumors. The CR rate at the primary tumor site after 2 cycles of ACPF was 53% and the
overall response rate was 100%. Twenty-nine (96%) patients completed 3 cycles of ACPF, 26 (90%) completed definitive RT per protocol, and 22 of the 27 evaluable patients (81%) received > 2 of the 3 planned doses of cisplatin with RT. The estimated 2-year overall
and progression-free survival rates were 84% and 65%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Induction ACPF resulted in a high CR rate (53%)
at the primary tumor site even in large tumors and did not adversely affect delivery of definitive CRT. Further investigation of ACPF

INTRODUCTION
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) afflicts more than 500,000 patients annually worldwide.1 Most
patients present with locally advanced disease and are often treated with definitive radiation therapy (RT). Chemotherapy
given concurrently with RT (CRT) improved local-regional disease control and overall survival (OS) compared with RT
alone but had minimal impact on the rate of distant metastases.2 Randomized trials of induction chemotherapy demonstrated a reduction in distant failure rates, but only 2 trials showed an improvement in OS.3,4 Recently, superior OS was
observed with the addition of either docetaxel or cremophor-based paclitaxel to induction PF (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil
[5-FU]) in patients subsequently treated with definitive RT5 or CRT.6,7 However, recurrent disease remains the primary
cause for treatment failure following induction chemotherapy and definitive CRT.
Complete response (CR) at the primary site following induction PF correlated with improved OS and disease control after
definitive RT.8,9 In most series, the rate of CR at the primary site after induction PF was 20% to 30%.4,9 Two strategies to
improve CR rates at the primary site following induction chemotherapy include the use of novel taxanes and the addition
of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. Increased intratumoral paclitaxel accumulation and antitumor activity

occurred with nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel
(nab-paclitaxel; Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ) compared with cremophor-based paclitaxel in nude mice bearing several human tumor xenografts.10
In breast cancer, nab-paclitaxel resulted in higher tumor response rates in comparison with cremophor-based
paclitaxel,11 which may be due to the high tumor expression of SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine). SPARC plays a role in albumin receptor–mediated
endothelial transport.12 SPARC expression is common in
tumor and stromal cells of HNSCC but not in adjacent
normal oral mucosa,13 and correlated with tumor response
to nab-paclitaxel in patients with HNSCC.14 More specifically, the concept is that high tumor expression of SPARC
reflects tumor cells that have high rates of albumin receptor–mediated endocytosis, and they respond better to albumin-bound chemotherapeutic agents because they
accumulate more albumin in the tumor cells. Inhibition of
epidermal growth factor receptor by cetuximab reduces proliferation and induces apoptosis of HNSCC cell lines, and
enhances the activity of cisplatin in xenograft models.15
The addition of cetuximab to PF increased tumor response
rates and OS in patients with metastatic HNSCC, and had
an acceptable safety profile.16
We hypothesized that a novel induction regimen of
weekly nab-paclitaxel and cetuximab given with every 3-week
PF (ACPF) would result in a high favorable tumor response
rate in patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are subsequently treated with definitive CRT. The primary efficacy
endpoint was CR rate at the primary tumor site after 2 cycles
of induction chemotherapy as assessed by clinical examinations, because this endpoint represents a surrogate marker of
improved disease control after definitive RT.8,9 We also
sought to determine whether this novel regimen would be
associated with an acceptable toxicity profile and whether it
would adversely affect delivery of definitive CRT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection

Treatment Plan

Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older with
untreated HNSCC of stages III and IVa/b (T1 excluded)
originating in the oropharynx, larynx, and oral cavity.17
Other criteria included adequate performance status
(Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status of 0 to 2)
and vital organ function. Exclusion criteria included peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN) of grade 2 or higher.
The Washington University Human Research Protection
Office approved the protocol, and all study participants
signed informed consent. This clinical trial was registered
at ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT00736944.

Induction therapy consisted of every 3-week cycles of intravenous (IV) nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 weekly on days 1, 8,
and 15, cetuximab 400 mg/m2 day 1 and 250 mg/m2
weekly subsequently, cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 and
5-FU 750 mg/m2 continuous infusion daily on days 1-3
(ACPF) (Fig. 1). After 2 cycles of ACPF, patients underwent an assessment of tumor response at the primary site
by clinical examination (laryngoscopy in office or operating room) by experienced oncologic surgeons, using categorical outcomes commonly employed by others with
slight modifications:8,18 CR, defined as complete

resolution of lesion or near CR, with minimal residual
mucosal abnormality; partial response (PR), defined as
50% to 94% decrease; stable disease (SD), defined as 0%
to 49% decrease; and progressive disease (PD), defined as
any increase. Patients with favorable (ie, CR, near CR,
PR) tumor response at the primary site by clinical examination then received a third cycle of ACPF before definitive CRT, whereas patients with an unfavorable (ie, SD,
PD) tumor response at the primary site by clinical examination proceeded directly to definitive CRT.
Definitive CRT began within 22 to 56 days after the
initiation of cycle 3 of ACPF. Intensity-modulated radiation
therapy was administered once daily, 5 days weekly. The
total dose of RT to gross disease was 7000 cGy in 35 fractions of 200 cGy each over 7 weeks, and areas at risk for microscopic disease in the ipsilateral and contralateral neck
received 5600 cGy. A dose of 6300 cGy in 35 fractions was
allowed to areas considered intermediate risk at physician
discretion. Patients with serum creatinine < 2.0 mg/dL were
scheduled to receive cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 22, and
43 of RT. Patients who failed to meet this criteria and had
no serious hypersensitivity reaction with prior cetuximab,
received cetuximab (400 mg/m2 IV loading dose 1 week
before RT then 250 mg/m2 weekly  7 doses) as a single
agent concurrent with RT. Patients who failed to meet criteria for either cisplatin or cetuximab received RT alone.
Standard Assessments

Baseline assessments included history and physical examination, laryngoscopy, computed tomography (CT) of the
neck, and body [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT). Assessments of
patient symptoms and adverse events (AEs) were performed weekly during ACPF, every 3 weeks during and 4
to 6 weeks after RT using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC), version 3.0. After 2
cycles of ACPF and 10 to 12 weeks after RT, patients
underwent assessment of tumor response by clinical examination, CT of the neck, and FDG-PET/CT. Response
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), version
1.0 was used to determine anatomic tumor response by
CT.19 Subsequently, patients were assessed for tumor
response with physical examination and laryngoscopy every 3 months and CT of the neck and chest performed at
6, 12, 20, 28, and 36 months following RT. Patient
comorbidities were quantified using the 27-item Adult
Comorbidity Evaluation (ACE-27) index.20
Immunohistochemistry
SPARC

SPARC expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed on pretreatment formalin768

fixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumor specimens using
4-lm sections. IHC was performed by hand using a commercially available monoclonal antibody for SPARC
(osteonectin; clone 15G12; Vector Laboratories; dilution
1:50; antigen retrieval consisting of proteinase K digestion; 30-minute room temperature incubation with primary antibody followed by a 30-minute room
temperature incubation with secondary). A known
SPARC-expressing HNSCC was used as a positive control. Samples were analyzed semiquantitatively by the
study pathologist (J.L., Jr.) reviewing 10 high-power fields
with scoring of tumor cells for extent of staining in quartiles as: 0 ¼ no staining; 1þ ¼ 0% to 24% staining; 2þ ¼
25% to 49% staining; 3þ ¼ 50% to 74% staining; 4þ ¼
75% to 100% staining. Samples were also analyzed semiqualitatively for staining intensity of tumor cells as: negative ¼ none; 1þ ¼ weak; 2þ ¼ moderate; 3þ ¼ strong.
Similar analyses were performed on the peritumoral stromal fibroblasts.
p16

For all patients with oropharyngeal primaries, IHC
was performed for p16 as described.21 Slides were
reviewed by the study pathologist and scored in a binary
fashion as positive (staining in > 50% of tumor cells) versus negative (no staining or staining in <50% of tumor
cells).
Statistical Methods
Tumor Response and Survival

The primary objective was to determine the CR rate
(defined as a composite of CR and near CR) at the primary tumor site using clinical examinations following 2
cycles of ACPF. We hypothesized that the CR rate at the
primary tumor site would be at least similar to our historical experience with docetaxel, PF, and cetuximab
(TPFþCet): 50% in T2, 20% in T3, and 0% in T4 disease.22 Given a sample size of 30 patients (10 in each
T-classification stratum), the overall proportion with CR
at the primary tumor site was estimated within 19%, as
the 95% confidence interval for 7 of 30 patients (9.9%,
42.3%).
OS (time from diagnosis to death or to last
follow-up alive) and progression-free survival (PFS, time
from diagnosis to death due to disease progression, to disease progression or to last follow-up alive) were estimated
by the Kaplan-Meier method.23 RT delivery (number of
fractions, elapsed days, and total dose) and chemotherapy
administration (number of planned doses administered,
total dose/m2) were determined and summarized for the
group by descriptive statistics.

Safety Analysis and Planned Stopping Rule

The type and grade of each AE were documented in
a frequency distribution for the whole group. An interim
safety analysis was performed after the first 10 patients to
confirm that the rate of grade 3 or 4 AEs during ACPF
did not exceed the predetermined maximum allowable
frequency of 35%.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and SPARC Expression

Thirty patients were enrolled (Table 1). Most patients
were older than 50 years and were smokers. Significant
comorbidities ranging from moderate to severe (ACE-27
indices scores of 2 or 3) were present in 63% of patients.
Most patients had large (T3,T4) primary tumors (74%)
and bulky (> N2b) nodal disease in the neck (80%).
Twenty-two patients (73%) had oropharyngeal cancers,
of which 17 of 21 (81%) tested were positive for p16, a
surrogate marker for the human papilloma virus (HPV).
SPARC expression was assessed by IHC staining on
28 patients (Table 2). The proportion of cells staining for

were greater in the stromal cells compared with that of the
tumor cells. Stromal fibroblast staining for SPARC was
present in all 28 evaluable cases (100%), whereas tumor cell
staining was present in 10 of 28 evaluable cases (35.7%).
Primary Tumor Site Response to ACPF

After 2 cycles of ACPF, the composite CR rate at the primary tumor site as assessed by clinical examination was
53.3% (CR was 40% [12 patients]; near CR was 13.3%
[4 patients]), whereas the rate of PR was 46.7% (14
patients). On univariate analysis, variables associated with
attaining a CR at the primary tumor site following 2
cycles of ACPF included fewer packs per day smoked and
absence of SPARC staining in the tumor (Table 3).
Neck Nodal and Overall Tumor Response to
ACPF

The tumor response rates at neck nodal sites after 2 cycles
of ACPF based on clinical examinations were 61% CR
(11 patients) and 39% PR (7 patients). Twelve patients
were not evaluable because of initial absence of nodal disease on clinical examination. On univariate analysis, the
only variable associated with attaining a CR at the neck
nodal sites following 2 cycles of ACPF was absence of
smoking history (CR in 3 of 3 nonsmokers versus 8 of 15
smokers, P ¼ .049). Table 4 summarizes and correlates
the tumor response rates at the primary site and at the
neck nodes after 2 cycles of ACPF based on clinical examination, CT, and FDG-PET/CT scans.
Treatment Delivery

Thirty patients completed 2 cycles, and 29 of the patients
completed 3 cycles of ACPF, and 28 patients underwent
definitive radiation-based therapy per protocol. One
patient died after cycle 2 of ACPF due to treatment769

Table 5 summarizes the grade 3 or 4 AEs related to
ACPF. The proportion of the 30 patients who experienced maximum grade 3, 4, or 5 AEs were 33% (10), 3%
(1), and 3% (1), respectively. Some patients experienced
more than 1 AE of grade 3 or higher. Most grade 3 AEs
that occurred, such as acneiform rash, asymptomatic neutropenia, fatigue, and mucositis were manageable. One
patient experienced a grade 4 hypersensitivity reaction
due to cetuximab. The single grade 5 AE was a neutropenia-related pneumonia. The safety analysis demonstrated
that the incidence of grade 3 or 4 AEs in the first 10
patients was 30%, which lies within the predetermined acceptable range (<35%).

following ACPF due to noncompliance but was treated
with definitive CRT.
During ACPF, the proportion of planned doses of
nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, cetuximab, and 5-FU administered were 92%, 97%, 87%, and 99%, respectively. During definitive RT, 26 patients received cisplatin, 1
received cetuximab, 1 received RT alone, and 1 received
770

cisplatin off protocol. Twenty-six of the 29 evaluable
patients (90%) completed the planned 35 fractions of
RT, whereas 2 elected to stop RT early and 1 received RT
off protocol. The median (range) elapsed days and dose of
RT administered were 50 (8-69) and 70 Gy (14-72 Gy),
respectively. The proportions of the 27 evaluable patients
given 3, 2, 1, or 0 doses of cisplatin during RT were 48%
(13), 33% (9), 15% (4), and 4% (1), respectively. Across
the planned sequential therapy with ACPF and CRT, the
median (range) cumulative dose of cisplatin delivered was
425 mg/m2 (150-525 mg/m2).

Survival

In this intent-to-treat analysis, 24 (80%) patients were
alive and disease-free, 3 (10%) were alive with disease, 1
(3%) died due to disease, 1 (3%) died due to intercurrent
illness (acute-on-chronic hepatitis C), and 1 (3%) died
due to TRM. Sites of failure included local-regional (3
patients) or distant (1 patient) locations. The median
(range) follow-up of the patients was 25 months (2-39
months). OS and PFS are depicted in Figure 2. The estimated 2-year OS for the whole group was 84%, and for
the oropharynx and laryngeal cancer subsites were 80%
and 86%, respectively. The estimated 2-year PFS for the
whole group was 65%, and for the oropharynx and laryngeal cancer subsites were 62% and 64%, respectively.

DISCUSSION
CR at the primary tumor site as assessed by clinical examination following induction chemotherapy with PF is a
favorable predictive factor for OS and disease control in
patients with HNSCC who were subsequently treated
with definitive RT.8,9 In this study, we observed a high
CR rate (53%) at the primary tumor site following 2
cycles of ACPF. These data compare favorably to the likelihood of achieving a CR at the primary site as assessed by
clinical examination with induction PF: 21% in laryngeal
HNSCC,18 20% in oropharyngeal carcinoma,4 and 33%
in oral cavity carcinoma.24 Large primary tumors are associated with a low rate of CR after induction PF.25 In our
study, 37% of patients had T4 tumors compared with <
16% of patients in these trials with induction PF.

than comparably staged patients in our ACPF trial. In our
historical experience with TPFþCet, the CR rate at the
primary site by clinical examination was only 14% overall
(T2 ¼ 50%;T3 ¼ 20%;T4 ¼ 0%).22 Higher rates of CR
were reported with a similar TPFþCet regimen.26,27
Rates of CR at the primary site with TPF varied from 8%
to 40%.28,29 Cremophor-based paclitaxel added to PF
increased the CR rate at the primary site from 33% to
49%.7 A high rate of CR (70%) at the primary site was
reported with weekly paclitaxel, cetuximab, and carboplatin, but most patients had T1 or T2 tumors.30
Our patient population was enriched in HPVrelated oropharyngeal SCC (56%), which could have
affected the primary endpoint because such tumors are
more chemosensitive.31 However, p16 status did not significantly associate with achieving a CR at the primary tumor site following 2 cycles of ACPF. This may have
occurred because most patients had additional adverse
characteristics such as smoking history (90% of patients)
and large (T3,4) primary tumors (73% of patients) that
offset the favorable predictive effect of HPV status on primary tumor site response to induction chemotherapy.32
Most patients in this study had significant comorbidities (63%), were smokers, and were older. In this context, the treatment delivery of induction ACPF and of
definitive CRT was very good. Nearly all patients (96%)
completed 3 cycles of ACPF, with the proportion of
planned doses of each drug administered being 87% to
99%. Of the 29 evaluable patients, 26 (90%) completed
the planned 35 fractions of definitive RT per protocol,
and 81% received >2 of the 3 planned doses of cisplatin
concurrently. In comparison, delivery of >2 of 3 planned
doses of cisplatin concurrent with definitive RT was
reported to be 74% following induction PF33 and 43% to
66% following induction TPF.34,35
The frequency and distribution of AEs during
ACPF were expected for induction chemotherapy administered to patients with locally advanced HNSCC. Overall, 12 (40%) patients experienced grade 3 or higher AEs,
of which 1 (3%) resulted in a TRM. However, several of
the grade 3 or 4 AEs (rash, neutropenia, and fatigue) were
manageable and did not result in serious sequelae. For
comparison, reported rates of grade 3 or higher AEs during induction TPF were 27% to 85%,35,36 during induction docetaxel, cisplatin, and cetuximab was 77%26 and
during weekly paclitaxel, carboplatin, and cetuximab was
45%.30
Consistent with prior reports, we found SPARC
expression to be common in tissue specimens obtained
772

from patients with HNSCC.13 In contrast to a prior
study, we observed an inverse relationship between
SPARC expression in tumor cells and primary tumor site
response to ACPF.14 The reason for these disparate findings is unclear. SPARC expression has been shown to correlate with worse prognosis, so perhaps this overcomes the
relationship with increased accumulation of tumor cell
nab-paclitaxel.
The 2-year OS and PFS for our patients treated with
ACPF followed by definitive CRT were 84% and 65%,
respectively. These outcomes compare favorably to other
reports using induction regimens of taxane and platinum
with or without cetuximab.6,7,26,30,35-37 Our data are limited by the median follow-up and the heterogeneity in tumor characteristics.
In conclusion, the novel induction regimen of
ACPF was feasible and resulted in a high CR rate (53%)
at the primary tumor site even in large (T3,4) primary
tumors. ACPF did not adversely affect delivery of definitive CRT. The 2-year survival outcomes with ACPF followed by definitive CRT were favorable and warrant
further investigation.
