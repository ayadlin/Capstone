Abstract
The purpose of this study was to define the toxic effects of vanadium on thymic
development in broilers fed on diets supplemented with 0, 5, 15, 30, 45 and 60
mg/kg of vanadium for 42 days. We examined the changes of relative weight, cell
cycle phase, apoptotic cells, and protein expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 in
the thymus by the methods of flow cytometry, TUNEL (terminal-deoxynucleotidyl
transferase mediated nick end labeling) and immunohistochemistry. The results
showed that dietary high vanadium (30mg/kg, 45mg/kg and 60mg/kg) caused
the toxic effects on thymic development, which was characterized by decreasing
relative weight, increasing G0/G1 phase (a prolonged nondividing state), reducing
S phase (DNA replication) and proliferating index (PI), and increasing percentages
of apoptotic thymocytes. Concurrently, the protein expression levels of Bax and
caspase-3 were increased, and protein expression levels of Bcl-2 were decreased. The
thymic development suppression caused by dietary high vanadium further leads to
inhibitive effects on T lymphocyte maturity and activity, and cellular immune function.
The above-mentioned results provide new evidences for further understanding the
vanadium immunotoxicity. In contrast, dietary 5 mg/kg vanadium promoted the
thymic development by increasing relative weight, decreasing G0/G1 phase, increasing
S phase and PI, and reducing percentages of apoptotic thymocytes when compared
to the control group and high vanadium groups.

Introduction

the toxic actions or side effects of vanadium and vanadium
compounds, which constitutes another important area of
research on vanadium.
The toxicity of vanadium compounds usually
increases as the valence increases. The pentavalent
compounds are the most toxic [24]. In vivo study in the
laying hen has shown that dietary vanadium reduces
body weight, feed consumption, egg production, egg
weight and shell quality [25]. Oxidative stress or damage,
reproductive toxicity (teratogenicity and embryotoxicity),
organ and tissue injury, neurobehavioral injury or
neurotoxicity, Mitochondrial dysfunction or injury,
genotoxicity, cytotoxicity and blood toxicity induced by
vanadium or vanadium compounds is well documented:
in vivo and in vitro of both man and animals [4, 12, 18,

Vanadium, as a transition element or an important
mineral distributed on earth, is used widely in the
chemical industry and is contained in several foods,
water particulates in air, fuel oils, and coal [1-4]. It is also
considered to be a nutritionally essential trace element for
animal species [5-8]. At present, vanadium or vanadium
compounds have been known as new promising drugs for
lowering blood glucose in diabetes due to their insulinmimetic actions and ability to counteract insulin resistance
[2, 4, 6, 9-20]. Also, they have been used in clinical
practice to protect against tumor or cancer as a potent
anticarcinogenic agent or antitumor drugs [4, 21-23]. At
the same time, there have been a lots of reports focused on

24, 26-52]. Sumanta et al. (2015) have reviewed that
vanadium or vanadium compounds cause toxic effects
including blood toxicity, abnormalities in development
and reproduction (teratogenicity and embryotoxicity),
neurobehavioral injury, morphological and functional
lesions in liver, kidneys, bones, spleen and leukocytes,
and inflammatory responses including rhinitis,
pharyngitis, chronic productive cough, tracheobronchitis
and bronchopneumonia [53]. Vanadium immunotoxicity
is also appeared in the rat and rabbit [54]. Our previous
studies have shown that dietary vanadium in 30 mg/kg and
over causes lesions, oxidative damage, immunotoxicity,
cytokine reduction, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and
microbiota alteration in the cecal tonsil, spleen, bursa
of Fabricius, kidney, liver, intestine and serum [55-72].
Michael et al. (1987) have concluded that animals during
periods of rapid growth are susceptible to vanadium
toxicity, and increased lipid peroxidation may be one
factor [73].
The thymus is the central lymphoid organ, and it
forms and grows immediately after birth in response to
postnatal antigenic stimulation and the demand for large

numbers of mature T cells [74]. The number of mature
T cells decides the biological function of the cells and is
correlated to the cellular immune function of the body
[75]. However, very limited data focus on the toxic effects
of vanadium on thymic development in human beings and
animals at present.
The aim of present research was to define the
toxic effects of vanadium on thymic development by
observing the changes of relative weight, cell cycle
phase, percentages of apoptotic thymocytes and protein
expression of apoptotic proteins (bcl-2, bax, and
caspase-3) using the methods of flow cytometry, TUNEL
(terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end
labeling) and immunohistochemistry.

Results

Change of thymic relative weight
The thymic relative weight was significantly lower
(P < 0.01) in the 30mg/kg, 45mg/kg and 60 mg/kg groups
than those in the control group from 7 to 42 days of age,
except 30mg/kg group at 42 days of age. At the same time,
the thymic relative weight was significantly increased (P <
0.05 or P < 0.01) in the 5 mg/kg group at 35 and 42 days
of age when compared with those in the control group.
The results are shown in Figure 1.

Clinical observation
Broilers grew much faster in 5 mg/kg group and
much slower in 30, 45 and 60 mg/kg groups than in
control group. Broilers in 45 and 60 mg/kg groups showed
decreased feed intake and depression. Loss of body weight
of 35.31%, 44.03%, and 68.05% was seen in 30, 45 and 60
mg/kg groups, respectively, at the end of the experiment
when compared with that in the control group.

eukaryotes, which is essential for development and
tissue homeostasis by providing a protective mechanism
to clean out aged or damaged cells [78, 79]. Apoptosis
is tightly controlled by changes, interactions and posttranslational modifications (including proteolytic cleavage
and phosphorylation) of proteins [80]. In the present study,
the results of FCM and TUNEL assays showed that dietary
high vanadium increased the percentage of splenocyte
apoptosis, which was consistent with the increased Bax
and caspase-3 protein expression levels and decreased
Bcl-2 protein expression levels in the thymus due to
the close relationship between apoptosis and apoptotic
protein expression levels. It is well known that increase
in pro-apoptotic protein expression or decrease in antiapoptotic protein expression can push cells down the
apoptotic pathway. The Bcl-2 family consists of the antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2-like proteins such as Bcl-2 and
Bcl-XL), and the pro-apoptotic proteins (such as bax-like
and the BH3-only proteins) [81]. Activation of the proapoptotic proteins induces cytochrome C release from
mitochondria into the cytoplasm [82-85]. Nevertheless,
Bcl-2-like proteins can prevent Bax-induced cell death by
blocking cytochrome C release [85]. As a pro-apoptotic
protein, caspase-3 is activated in the apoptotic cell both
by extrinsic (death ligand) and intrinsic (mitochondrial)
pathways [86, 87], and executes the apoptotic process
[88] . Also, the increased apoptotic thymocytes are closely
correlated to the cell cycle arrest caused by dietary high
vanadium.
The thymus is essential to the differentiation and
development of T cells. T cells develop until mature in
the thymus, and then migrate to the peripheral blood and
lymphatic system. The thymic development suppression
caused by dietary high vanadium can reduce the thymocyte
numbers and inhibit the thymic hormone synthesis,
implying that mature T lymphocytes in the thymus,
and T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood decrease in
number [55]. Simultaneously, dietary high vanadium has
been reported to reduce T lymphocyte numbers in the
lymphatic organ or tissue, such as spleen, cecal tonsil and
ileum [57, 60, 64]. T lymphocytes take part in cellular
immunity. Thus, the cellular immune function is finally
impaired due to the decreased T-lymphocyte numbers and
reduced T lymphocyte activities in the peripheral blood
and lymphatic organ or tissue caused by dietary high
vanadium.
Based on the results of our study and the
abovementioned discussion, the toxic effect mechanism
of dietary high vanadium on thymic development is
summarized in Figure 18.
The decreased relative weight, cell cycle arrest
and increased apoptosis percentages are consistent with
vanadium accumulation in the thymus (Figures 16 and
17), indicating that the vanadium accumulation is main or/
and direct reason of the thymic development suppression.
Concurrently, dietary 5 mg/kg vanadium promotes

Changes of vanadium contents in the thymus and
serum
The results in Figures 16 and 17 showed that
the vanadium contents in the thymus and serum were
increased as dietary vanadium increased. Vanadium
contents were found to be significantly higher (P < 0.01 or
P < 0.05) in the 30 mg/kg, 45 mg/kg and 60mg/kg groups
than those in the control group.

Discussion
The aim of this study was to define the toxic effect
of dietary vanadium on thymic development. Indeed, we
found considerable evidence that dietary high vanadium
( in the range of 30 mg/kg to 60mg/kg ) had adverse
effects on thymic development: reduced relative weight
(Figure 1), arrested cell-cycle (Figures 2-6) and increased
apoptosis (Figures 7-9). Relative weight has been
considered as a satisfactory measure of nutritive value,
which can also represent the development state of organs
[76]. In the present study, the results showed that the
thymic development was obviously inhibited in the three
high vanadium groups, which was consistent with the cell
cycle arrest.
In order to reveal the mechanism of thymic
development suppression caused by dietary high
vanadium, we used flow cytometry to analyze the
cell cycle of thymocytes. Cell cycle includes S (DNA
replication), M (nuclear division and cell division), G1
(the cell-cycle gap phase between M phase and S phase),
G2 (the cell-cycle gap phase between S phase and M
phase) phases, which is central to maintain homeostasis
in the multicellular organisms [77]. The results showed
that high vanadium caused arrest at the G0/G1 phases,
which inhibited damaged cells to stop DNA replication
at G1 phase, and ultimately resulted in the thymocyte
apoptosis when damaged cells can’t be repaired. This
observation was supported by the findings that high
vanadium caused decreased numbers of thymocytes in
the S phase and diminished PI of thymocytes (Figures 5
and 6), and increased percentage of apoptotic thymocytes
(Figures 7-9). It is clear that the cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis of thymocytes can be the main mechanism of
thymic development suppression caused by dietary high
vanadium.

the thymic development by increasing relative weight,
decreasing G0/G1 phase, increasing S phase and PI, and
reducing percentages of apoptotic thymocytes when
compared to the control group and high vanadium groups.
In conclusion, dietary high vanadium ( in the range
of 30 mg/kg to 60mg/kg ) causes the toxic effect on thymic
development by decreasing relative weight, arresting
cell cycle, increasing apoptosis percentage. The thymic
development suppression caused by dietary high vanadium
further leads to inhibitive effects on T lymphocyte
maturity and activity, and cellular immune function
in the chicken. This study provides a new evidence for
further understanding the vanadium immunotoxicity. In
contrast, dietary 5 mg/kg vanadium promotes the thymic
development by increasing relative weight, decreasing
G0/G1 phase, increasing S phase and PI, and reducing
percentages of apoptotic thymocytes when compared to
the control group and high vanadium groups.

At 14, 28, and 42 days of age, five broilers in each
group were selected for determination of the cell-cycle
stages in the thymus by flow cytometry, as described by
Cui et al. [58].
Thymuses were immediately removed and
macerated by grinding to form a cell suspension that was
filtered through 300-mesh nylon screen. The cells were
washed twice with cold phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.27.4), and were then suspended in 1× binding buffer (Cat.
No. 51-66121E) at a concentration of 1×106 cells/mL.
Five hundred microliters of the solution was transferred
to a 5-mL culture tube and centrifuged (500-1,000 rpm).
After removing the supernatant, 5μL 0.25% Triton X-100
and 5μL PI (Cat. No. 51-66211E) were added. The cells
were gently vortexed and incubated for 30 min at 25°C
in the dark. Finally, 500 μL PBS was added to each tube,
and the contents were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD
FACSCalibur) within 45 min.

Chickens and diets

Determination of apoptosis in the thymus

Four hundred and twenty one-day-old healthy
broilers were divided into six groups. There were 70
broilers in each group. The broilers were housed in
cages with electrically heated units and were provided
with water as well as the under-mentioned control or
experimental diets ad libitum for 42 days.
A corn-soybean basal diet formulated by the
National Research Council [89] was the control diet
(vanadium 0.073 mg/kg). Ammonium metavanadate
(NH4VO3) was mixed into the corn-soybean basal diet to
produce experimental diets with 5 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, 30
mg/kg, 45 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg of vanadium, respectively.
Our experiments involving the use of broilers and all
experimental procedures involving animals were approved
by Animal Care and Use Committee, Sichuan Agricultural
University.

Flow cytometry method At 14, 28, and 42 days
of age, five chickens in each group were humanely
euthanized. Thymuses were taken for the determination
of apoptotic thymocytes by flow cytometry, as described
by Peng et al. [90].
The cell suspension was prepared as described in
the method of cell of cycle. One hundred microliters of
the solution was transferred to a 5-ml culture tube, and
then 5 μl of Annexin V-FITC (Cat. No: 51-65874X) and
5 μl of PI (Cat. No: 51-66211E) were added. The cells
were gently vortexed and incubated for 15 min at room
temperature (25°C) in the dark. Four hundred microliters
of 1×binding buffer was added to each tube and analyzed
by flow cytometry within 1 h.
TUNEL assay Five broilers in each group were
humanely euthanized at 42 days of age. Thymuses
were taken and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
after postmortem examination, and then processed and
trimmed, embedded in paraffin.
TUNEL assay was carried out according to
the manual of In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Cat:
11684817980, Roche, Germany). Briefly, tissue sections
(5 μm thick) were rehydrated in a series of xylene and
ethanol solutions and then rinsed in ddH2O, digested
with proteinase K 50 μl (Tris·HCl pH7.8 diluted) for 15
min, then incubated with 3% H2O2 in methanol for 15
min at RT (room temperature) to inactivate endogenous
peroxidase. Subsequently, sections were transferred
to a reaction mixture containing biotin-dUTP terminal
deoxynucleotidyl and incubated in a humid chamber for 1
h at 37°C, followed by washing in phosphate buffer saline

Clinical signs and the relative weight of thymus
Clinical signs were observed and recorded every
day. At 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days of age during the
experiment, five broilers in each group were humanely
euthanized after they were weighed. Thymus was taken
from each broiler and weighed after dissecting connective
tissue around the organ. Related weight of thymus was
calculated by the following formula:
Related weight = organ weight (g)/body weight (kg)

(PBS, pH 7.2-7.4). Sections were incubated in ConverterPOD (HRP) for 30 min at 37°C. Reaction product was
visualized with DAB kit (AR1022, Boster, Wuhan,
China). After a final washes in ddH2O, slices were lightly
counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated in ethanol,
cleared in xylene and mounted.

The significance of difference between the control
groups and the vanadium-treated groups was analyzed by
the use of variance analysis, and the results are presented
as means±standard deviation (X±SD). The analysis
was performed with the one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) test of SPSS 16.0 for windows. A value of P <

Acknowledgments

At 14, 28 and 42 days of age, five broilers in each
group were humanely euthanized. Thymuses were taken
for the detection of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 protein
expression by the immunohistochemical methods (SABC)
and stained with DAB as described by Wang et al [91].
Anti-Bax (BA0315), anti-Bcl-2 (BA0412) and anticaspase-3 (BA0588), and DAB were purchased from
Wuhan Boster Biological Technology Co., Ltd., China.
Images from five slices per thymus were taken 200
μm apart. Five visions per slice were randomly chosen for
assessment of positive cells using image analysis software
(JID801D). The average grayscale of the positive cells
was automatically calculated. Immunoreactive intensity
was expressed by average grayscale. Values < 160 was
considered high, 160-170 medium and 170-180 low.
