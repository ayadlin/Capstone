of osteoclastic differentiation for intraosseous tumor growth

Although increasing evidence suggests a critical role for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor b (b-PDGFR) signaling
in prostate cancer (PCa) progression, the precise roles of b-PDGFR and PDGF isoform-speciﬁc cell signaling have not been
delineated. Recently, we identiﬁed the PDGF-D isoform as a ligand for b-PDGFR in PCa and showed that PDGF-D is activated
by serine protease-mediated proteolytic removal of the CUB domain in a two-step process, yielding ﬁrst a hemidimer (HD) and
then a growth factor domain dimer. Herein, we demonstrate that the expression of PDGF-D in human PCa LNCaP cells leads
to enhanced bone tumor growth and bone responses in immunodeﬁcient mice. Histopathological analyses of bone tumors
generated by PDGF-D-expressing LNCaP cells (LNCaP-PDGF-D) revealed osteolytic and osteoblastic responses similar to those
observed in human PCa bone metastases. Importantly, we discovered a novel function of PDGF-D in the regulation of
osteoclast differentiation, independent of the RANKL/RANK signaling axis. Although both PDGF-B and -D were able to activate
b-PDGFR, only PDGF-D was able to induce osteoclastic differentiation in vitro, and upregulate the expression and nuclear
translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells 1, a master transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, these
results reveal a new function of PDGF-D as a regulator of osteoclastic differentiation, an activity critical for the establishment
of skeletal metastatic deposit in PCa patients.

INTRODUCTION
The ‘seed and soil’ hypothesis is often invoked to address cellular
and molecular mechanisms underlying the tendency of prostate
cancer (PCa) to metastasize to bone. Cancer cells, upon their
arrival in the bone marrow, perturb the delicate homeostatic
balance of the bone marrow microenvironment by activating
proteolytic cascades and growth factor signaling networks.1
Tumor-mediated bone responses include increased osteoclast
differentiation, leading to bone destruction and new bone
formation. Growth-promoting factors released from the metabolized bone matrix during osteoclastic bone resorption are thought
to provide a favorable microenvironment for tumor cell proliferation, creating a positive feedback signaling loop. Thus, it is
important to identify PCa cell-initiated signaling axes critical for
tumor -- bone stromal interactions for more in-depth understanding of PCa bone metastasis.
The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family, known as a
mesenchymal growth factor, consists of four members, PDGF-A,
-B, -C and -D. PDGFs have critical roles in epithelial -- stromal
communication during physiological or pathological conditions.2
These interactions are often initiated by PDGF receptor signaling
in stroma that is activated by the PDGF ligand produced by
epithelial cells. While PDGF-A and -B are secreted as active growth
factor dimers and readily activate their cognate receptors,
a-PDGFR and b-PDGFR, the newly discovered PDGF family
members PDGF-C and PDGF-D are secreted as latent homodimers
containing the N-terminal CUB domain and the C-terminal growth

factor domain (GFD). Removal of the CUB domain is required for
PDGF-C and -D to activate a-PDGFR and b-PDGFR, respectively.3 - 5
Recently, we showed that PDGF-D is activated by serine proteases
in a two-step process, creating a hemidimer (HD) followed by a
GFD dimer (GFD-D). Proteolytic cleavage of the hinge domain in
one chain generates a HD containing one full-length and one GFD,
and the subsequent cleavage of the hinge domain in the other
chain results in GFD-D.6
Increasing evidence indicates a critical role for b-PDGFR
signaling in PCa bone metastasis. Ampliﬁcation of the conserved
domains of tyrosine kinase receptors using degenerate primers
identiﬁed PDGFRs as the most commonly ampliﬁed transcripts
from pooled aspirate specimens of PCa bone metastases.7
Another study revealed that b-PDGFR is one of ﬁve genes that
predict recurrence after prostatectomy.8 Indeed, a majority of PCa
tissues express b-PDGFR at both primary and metastasized sites in
the bone, as determined by immunohistochemical analysis.9
Consistent with the potential oncogenic activity of PDGF signaling
in PCa progression, investigators have reported the therapeutic
potential of targeting PDGF/PDGFR axis in clinical trials of
hormone refractory PCa.10,11 However, it was unclear as to how
b-PDGFR is activated, because the expression of PDGF-B, thought
for more than two decades to be the sole ligand for b-PDGFR, has
not been found to be elevated in PCa. Our recent immunohistochemical analysis of human PCa specimens showed that increased
PDGF-D expression is associated with increased Gleason scores
and tumor stage.6 Importantly, we previously showed that

cells (LNCaP-PDGF-D) were injected into tibiae of male severe
combined immunodeﬁcient mice. LNCaP cells are known to grow
poorly within the bone environment. However, radiographic
analyses showed visible signs of bone reactions in a majority of
tibiae injected with LNCaP-PDGF-D cells after 11 weeks (data not
shown). Radiographic analyses after 17 weeks revealed signiﬁcant
bone reactions in the majority of mice injected intratibially with
LNCaP-PDGF-D cells. In contrast, only one mouse injected
intratibially with LNCaP-neo cells showed signs suggestive of
changes in bone structure (Figure 1a). After 18 weeks, mice were
killed and histopathological examinations of tibiae conﬁrmed
intraosseous tumor growth in the tibiae with radiographic changes.
As graphed in Figure 1b, 8 out of 13 tibiae injected with LNCaPPDGF-D harbored intraosseous tumors, whereas only 1 out of 14
tibiae injected with LNCaP-neo cells contained intraosseous tumor.
In tibiae harboring LNCaP-PDGF-D tumors, the majority of the bone
marrow cavity was replaced by PCa cells, where 10-- 60% of the
residual bone surface was found to be adjacent to tumor cells. In
contrast, o5% of the bone surface interacted with LNCaP-neo
tumor cells. Bone histomorphometric analysis showed that the
average tumor area (pixels2) of LNCaP-PDGF-D tumors was
6 049 937, as compared with 469 718 in the one bone tumor
formed by LNCaP-neo cells (Figure 1c). These results demonstrated
that PDGF-D expression drastically increased both tumor take and
intraosseous growth of LNCaP cells in the bone microenvironment.

increased PDGF-D/b-PDGFR signaling accelerates the early onset
of subcutaneous tumors formed by LNCaP PCa cells in severe
combined immunodeﬁcient mice, and drastically enhances cancer
cell invasion into the surrounding stroma,12 demonstrating a
potential oncogenic activity of PDGF-D in PCa.
In this study, we wished to determine the functional
signiﬁcance of tumor-derived PDGF-D in tumor-induced bone
reactions as well as the establishment and expansion of skeletal
metastatic deposits. Here, we show that PDGF-D expression in
LNCaP cells facilitates intraosseous tumor growth and leads to
both osteolytic and osteoblastic responses. Importantly, we
demonstrate that recombinant PDGF-D directly stimulates osteoclast differentiation in vitro, independent of the receptor activator
of nuclear factor kB ligand (RANKL) signaling axis. Although both
PDGF-B and -D are able to activate b-PDGFR, PDGF-D, but not
PDGF-B, induces multinucleation and osteoclast differentiation
in vitro. PDGF-D-speciﬁc signal transduction results in increased
expression and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated
T cells 1 (NFATc1), a master transcription factor for osteoclast
differentiation. Collectively, our studies demonstrate a novel
function of PDGF-D in the regulation of osteoclast activation, a
key initial step for bone remodeling and the establishment of
metastatic deposits of PCa cells at bone.

keen resemblance to human prostate bone metastases.13 In
Figure 2a, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of tumor-bearing
bones revealed that the LNCaP-PDGF-D tumor corresponding to
No. C6 mouse tibiae (Figure 1a) formed a big tumor mass in the
bone marrow cavity. The intratibial LNCaP-PDGF-D tumor was in
close proximity to abundant woven bone with densely deposited
bone matrix that was shown as dark blue color (collagen I) by
trichrome staining. The activated osteoclastic cells, manifested by

the dark purple color with Tartrate Resistant Acid Phosphatase
(TRAP) staining, were distributed almost exclusively at the woven
bone interface with LNCaP-PDGF-D tumors (arrows in Figure 2a).
Osteoclast activation was readily detected in all intratibial LNCaP
tumors as shown in Supplementary Figure 1. In contrast, the
intraosseous LNCaP-neo tumor only formed three tiny tumor
islands throughout the whole tibia section. A typical LNCaP-neo
tumor island was shown in Figure 2b, which was circled by the

Figure 2. LNCaP-derived PDGF-D induces pronounced osteoclastic and osteoblastic responses. Sections of intraosseous LNCaP-PDGF-D tumor,
LNCaP-neo tumor and control tibia injected with media only were analyzed by H&E, TRAP and trichrome staining, respectively. (a) LNCaPPDGF-D tumor and its adjacent bone responses occupied the bone marrow cavity shown by H&E staining (  100 HE and  200 HE). The
black-boxed area in TRAP staining (  100 TRAP) was magnified to  200 (  200 TRAP). Activated osteoclast cells (arrows) at the LNCaP-PDGFD tumor -- bone interface were shown by the dark purple color by TRAP staining. The densely deposited collagen I in the woven bone was
shown by the dark blue color by trichrome staining (  100). (b) In H&E staining (  100 and  200), a small intraosseous LNCaP-neo tumor
circled by blue lines is surrounded by a large sheet of osteoid. The black-boxed area in TRAP staining (  100 TRAP) was magnified to  400.
TRAP staining showed very minor staining at the interface between osteoid and native trabecular bone (arrows). Trichrome staining showed
that classic basophilic osteoblasts lined the interface between LNCaP-neo tumor (circled by black line) and neighboring osteoid tissue (light
blue color). Many osteoblasts were embedded in the osteoid (light blue by trichrome staining) and turning into bone cells. (c) In H&E staining,
the media injection-controlled tibia showed normal bone marrow tissue and intact native trabecular bone. TRAP staining showed little to no
activated osteoclast cells within bone marrow tissue. Trichrome staining showed the native trabecular bone in dark blue color.

lines. Most interestingly, the tiny tumor island was surrounded by
a massive sheet of osteoid, which was demonstrated by light blue
color in trichrome staining. In addition, the LNCaP-neo tumor was
adjacent to or lined by many basophilic osteoblastic cells shown
by H&E staining. TRAP staining of LNCaP-neo tumor revealed a
very minor osteoclastic response, which is at the interface
between the osteoblastic response and native trabecular bone,
but not adjacent to the LNCaP-neo tumor. Histopathological
analyses of tibia from injection control showed intact native
trabecular bones and normal bone marrow tissue (Figure 2c),
where little to no TRAP staining is observed at the interface
between bone marrow and trabecular bone. Trichrome staining
showed dark blue color in the native trabecular bone. Taken
together, these results suggest that the PDGF-D-mediated bone
reactions, especially osteoclast activation, are critical for early
onset, effective growth and expansion of the tumor deposit of
human PCa LNCaP cells in the bone microenvironment.

To conﬁrm that full-length rPDGF-D can be processed by
proteinase(s) produced by RAW264.7 cells, rPDGF-D was incubated with conditioned medium (CM) collected from RAW264.7
cells or serum-free medium (negative control). As shown in
Figure 3b, rPDGF-D was effectively processed into the 18kDa
active GFD by RAW264.7-derived proteinase(s) in a time-dependent manner. To determine whether PDGF-D directly regulates
osteoclastic differentiation, and if so, whether PDGFR activation by
PDGF-B has similar effects, RAW264.7 cells were treated with
rPDGF-D or rPDGF-B dimers at the same molar concentration. The
osteoclastogenic factor RANKL was included as a positive
control,15,16 while dulbecco’s modiﬁed eagle’s medium (DMEM)
containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was used as a negative
control. As shown in Figure 3c, rPDGF-D effectively induced the
differentiation of the pre-osteoclast cells, as detected by multinucleation and positive TRAP staining. The number of differentiated osteoclasts increased upon PDGF-D or RANKL treatments in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3d). Real-time PCR analysis
showed increased TRAP expression at the mRNA level upon
treatments with PDGF-D or RANKL (Figure 3e). In contrast, PDGFR
activation by PDGF-B failed to induce osteoclast differentiation or
TRAP mRNA expression in these cells (Figures 3c -- e). While PDGFD effectively induced osteoclastic differentiation at a concentration of 10 ng/ml, PDGF B failed to induce osteoclast differentiation
even at a concentration of 40 ng/ml (Figure 3d).
To ensure that both PDGF ligands used in these experiments
were biologically active, rPDGF-B and rPDGF-D were applied to
serum-starved NIH3T3 cells for 10 min, followed by the analysis of
b-PDGFR activation. PDGF-B activated b-PDGFR more effectively
than PDGF-D in NIH3T3 cells (Figure 3f), consistent with previous

PDGF-D, but not PDGF-B, induces osteoclastic differentiation
in vitro independent of RANKL/RANK pathway
On the basis of the above results, we hypothesized that PDGF-D
mediates osteoclastic differentiation critical for the establishment
and expansion of intraosseous tumor growth. To test this
hypothesis, we chose the mouse preosteoclast cell line
RAW264.7 as an in vitro model. RT -- PCR analysis of RNA obtained
from RAW264.7 cells showed low mRNA expression of b-PDGFR
and a non-detectable level of a-PDGFR, as compared with NIH3T3
cells (Figure 3a). As previously reported,14 RAW264.7 cells express
urokinase-type plasminogen activator, an activator of PDGF-D.5

reports that PDGF-B is a stronger agonist for b-PDGFR than
PDGF-D.17 Extracellular signal-regulated kinases, downstream
signaling molecules of PDGFR, were also activated in NIH3T3
cells, conﬁrming that both rPDGF-B and rPDGF-D are biologically
active.
We previously showed that LNCaP cells auto-activate latent
PDGF-D into the active form that can induce phosphorylation of
b-PDGFR in a paracrine manner.12 Importantly, CM from LNCaPPDGF-D cells induced a signiﬁcant increase in osteoclast
differentiation in vitro compared with CM from LNCaP-neo control
cells (Figure 3g).
It was previously shown that increased expression and nuclear
translocation of NFATc1, the master transcription factor for
osteoclastogenesis, is a key event for osteoclast differentiation.18 - 20 Therefore, we examined the levels of NFATc1 in
RAW264.7 cells following the treatment with rPDGF-B, rPDGF-D
and rRANKL. As shown in Figure 4a, markedly increased NFATc1
staining was observed in multinucleated RAW264.7 cells following
RANKL or PDGF-D treatment, but not PDGF-B treatment.
Immunoblot analysis of NFATc1 showed that RANKL increases
the nuclear NFATc1 level, in agreement with previous reports.18,19
Importantly, PDGF-D, but not PDGF-B, drastically increased
expression levels of NFATc1 especially in the nuclear fraction
(Figure 4b, top panel), further supporting a novel function of
PDGF-D in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation. As controls
of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, the same blot was probed
with GAPDH and histone H1 antibodies (Figure 4b, middle and
bottom panels). To assess the functional signiﬁcance of NFATc1 in
PDGF-D-mediated osteoclast activation, preosteoclast cells were
treated with rPDGF-D in the presence or absence of 0.3 mM NFAT
inhibitor. Expression of osteoclast differentiation marker TRAP was
signiﬁcantly reduced in the presence of NFATc1 inhibitor,
demonstrating a critical role for NFATc1 in PDGF-D-mediated
osteoclast differentiation (Figure 4c). We next asked whether
PDGF-D-mediated osteoclast differentiation involves RANKL/RANK
pathway. When the effects of PDGF-D on RANKL expression were
examined at the protein and RNA levels, neither the immunoblot
nor the RT -- PCR analysis detected RANKL expression with or
without PDGF-D treatments (data not shown), suggesting that
PDGF-D induction of RANKL/RANK autocrine signaling is unlikely
in RAW264.7 cells. To further investigate the possible involvement
of RANKL/RANK signaling, RANKL- and PDGF-D-induced osteoclast
differentiation were examined in the presence or absence of
osteoprotegerin, a soluble decoy receptor for RANKL.15,21 As
expected, osteoprotegerin effectively abolished the RANKLinduced osteoclastic differentiation. In contrast, it had little effect
on PDGF-D-induced osteoclastogenesis (Figure 5). Taken together,
these results unveiled a novel function of PDGF-D in the
regulation of osteoclast differentiation utilizing a novel signaling
pathway independent of RANKL/RANK interactions.
Proteolytic processing of PDGF-D at the hinge region is essential
for its biological activity to induce osteoclastic differentiation
We previously identiﬁed the arginine residues (R247 and R249) in
the hinge region to be critical for the proteolytic processing of
PDGF-D into HD and GFD-D by serine proteases such as urokinasetype plasminogen activator and matriptase.5,6 Next, we asked
whether proteolytic processing of PDGF-D at the hinge region is
crucial to its osteoclastic effect on RAW264.7 cells. To address this
question, RAW264.7 cells were treated with wild-type (WT) or the
cleavage-deﬁcient PDGF-D mutant proteins, followed by TRAP
staining and real-time RT -- PCR analysis of TRAP mRNA. As shown
in Figure 6, the cleavage-deﬁcient PDGF-D mutant proteins failed
to induce osteoclast activation and TRAP expression (Figure 6),
further supporting our conclusion that the proteolytic processing
of full-length PDGF-D is required for PDGF-D activation of
preosteoclasts. Lastly, we provide in vivo evidence that b-PDGFR

DISCUSSION
A signiﬁcant proportion of PCa patients develop metastatic
disease after local therapy, with growth and expansion of skeletal
tumor deposits, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
this disease.22 PCa bone metastases are generally categorized as
osteoblastic, based on radiographic imaging. However, on a
cellular level, most patients have components of both bone
resorption and bone formation. Both clinical and experimental
data supports a pivotal role of osteoclasts in the pathogenesis of
cancer bone metastasis, regardless of the radiographic appearance.23 Osteoclastic activation is believed to be a key initiator of
bone metastasis for PCa, followed by the release of numerous
growth factors from bone matrix in favor of tumor growth and the
establishment of bone metastasis. Osteoclastic bone resorption is

elevated in bone metastases from many different types of cancer,
causing skeletal-related complications such as bone pain,
hypercalcemia, pathological bone loss, and spinal cord and nerve
compression syndromes. In this regard, our ﬁnding of a novel role
of PDGF-D in osteoclast activation may not only help us
understand the molecular mechanisms of PCa bone metastasis,
but also may have broad implications in many human diseases.
Although recent studies indicated increased b-PDGFR signaling
in PCa bone metastasis, knowledge in this area remains
incomplete. The present study demonstrates that tumor-produced
PDGF-D mediates both osteoclastic and osteoblastic reactions
in vivo. Consistent with our ﬁndings, recent clinical trials in
patients with either chronic myelogenous leukemia or gastrointestinal stromal tumors who received imatinib mesylate
& 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited

W Huang et al

predicted critical roles of PDGF receptor signaling in both bone
resorption and bone formation.24,25 In fact, previous studies over
recent decades have suggested molecular mechanisms by which
PDGF, a mesenchymal growth factor, regulates the bone turnover
process. PDGF regulates the commitment of stromal mesenchymal cells to differentiate into osteoprogenitor cells,26 - 28 suggesting a role for PDGF in bone formation. In addition, PDGF was
thought to stimulate bone resorption by upregulating matrixdegrading enzyme expression.29 - 31 However, neither the PDGF
ligand-speciﬁc b-PDGFR signaling cascade nor a direct role for
PDGF signaling in osteoclast activation has been reported. In this
regard, our novel ﬁnding that PCa-derived PDGF-D induces
osteoclast activation is of importance. It is also echoing the in
vivo study by Uutela et al.32 where PDGF-D induced remarkable
recruitment of macrophages during the process of wound healing
in PDGF-D transgenic mice, implicating the role of PDGF-D in cells
from the monocytic lineage. While PDGF-B undergoes intracellular
proteolytic processing and is secreted as an active growth factor,
PDGF-D undergoes extracellular proteolytic processing to gain its
biological activity. Here, we provided evidence that a novel
function of PDGF-D in stimulating preosteoclasts also requires
sequential processing of the latent PDGF-D into an active form by
extracellular proteases. The present study revealed striking
differences between two b-PDGFR activators, PDGF-B and PDGFD, in mediating signal transduction. This ﬁnding is likely to have
broad implications in many cellular processes regulated by PDGFB and PDGF-D. Our study may also provide valuable information
for the design of better therapeutic agents targeting the PDGF-D/
b-PDGFR axis, rather than using selective, but not speciﬁc, tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib mesylate, that showed only
limited success in PCa patients at least in part due to side effects
such as irritation in gastrointestinal tract and cardiotoxicity.33 - 35
The CUB domain of PDGF-D prevents its GFD from binding and
activating its cognate receptor, b-PDGFR. Our recent study
demonstrated that serine proteases, such as urokinase-type
plasminogen activator and matriptase, process the full-length
PDGF-D dimer into the GFD-D in a two-step manner involving the
generation of HD, an intermediate dimer species containing one
full-length and one GFD.6 Consistent with our data that the CUB
domain is involved in modulating the biological activity of PDGFD, a recent study showed that cells expressing full-length PDGF-D
are more tumorigenic in vivo than those expressing activated GFD
alone.36 The present study also suggests the potential signiﬁcance
of PDGF-D-speciﬁc signaling capacity in a cell-type-speciﬁc
manner during PCa progression. The present study demonstrated
that tumor-produced PDGF-D mediates bone reactions and
enhances LNCaP tumor growth in the bone microenvironment.
When LNCaP-neo and LNCaP-PDGF-D cells were subcutaneously
injected, PDGF-D expression had little effect on either tumorigenicity or tumor volumes, whereas PDGF-D drastically enhances
PCa interactions with surrounding stromal cells.12 Taken together,
we propose that PDGF-D-mediated stromal interactions are critical
for PCa tumor expansion in the bone microenvironment, as the
normal bone matrix is not conductive to tumor cell colonization. In
contrast, PDGF-D-mediated tumor -- stromal interactions may be
critical for tumor cell invasion/metastasis and less critical for tumor
growth in the primary site. Moreover, the present study
demonstrated, for the ﬁrst time, a novel osteoclast-inducing role
of PDGF-D, independent of RANK/RANKL. These results open up
new avenues for bone-speciﬁc targeted therapies in PCa bone
metastasis and may have important implications with regard to
osteoclast biology in general.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents
The establishment and maintenance of control and PDGF-D transfected
LNCaP cells were described previously.12 Monocytic RAW264.7 cells were
& 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited

purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained in DMEM with
10% FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA). NIH3T3 mouse ﬁbroblasts were
maintained in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Recombinant RANKL and PDGF-B proteins
were purchased from Peprotech Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) and Calbiochem
(Gibbstown, NJ, USA), respectively. Recombinant PDGF-D was generated
using the vaccinia expression system12 and puriﬁed using His-Trap column
from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ, USA) following manufacturer’s instruction. The quality and concentration of puriﬁed recombinant
PDGF-D was determined on the basis of silver staining using SilverSNAP
staining kit from Thermo Scientiﬁc (Rockford, IL, USA). NFATc1 antibodies
for immunoblot analysis and immunoﬂuorescence were purchased from
BD Biosciences (Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.
(Santa Cruz, CA, USA), respectively. Histone H1 antibody was purchased
from Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA). All other antibodies were purchased
from Cell Signaling Biotechnology Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA). NFAT inhibitor
III was purchased from Calbiochem (Gibbstown, NJ, USA).

Intratibial injection of LNCaP cells
Five-week-old male CB-17 severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice were
purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY, USA). In order to model
the expanding metastatic deposit, 2  105 LNCaP-PDGF-D and LNCaP-neo
cells were injected into the proximal end of tibiae 4 - 5 mm down the
diaphysis. A total of 15 mice were used for each group and 4 mice were
injected with medium as a control. Lukens bone wax (Surgical Specialties
Co., Reading, PA, USA) was applied over the injection site to prevent cell
leakage. Starting from the third week, mice were monitored by X-rays
bi-weekly. All procedures were done in compliance with the Animal
Investigation Committee of Wayne State University and NIH guidelines.

Histomorphometry
After 18 weeks, tibiae were harvested, X-rayed, ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, decalciﬁed in 10% EDTA for 10 - 14 days and parafﬁn
embedded. The bone tissues were sectioned longitudinally across the
bone marrow cavity with a thickness of 5 mm and stained with H&E.
Representative slide of each tibial sample was selected by a pathologist for
analyzing tumor area. Digital photomicrographs were captured under  5
magniﬁcation using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope (Zeiss, Göttingen,
Germany) equipped with a software-controlled digital camera (Axiovision;
Zeiss); images were merged to display a panoramic view of the entire
sagittal section of the tibia. The area occupied by the tumor in the
histological section was calculated by the software based on the
measurement of the corresponding areas in pixels,2 as described
previously,37 which was shown as a bar graph for each tumor-bearing
tibia in Figure 1c.

TRAP staining of tibiae bone sections
TRAP staining was performed using an acid phosphatase leukocyte kit
from Sigma Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA) per the manufacturer’s protocol.
Activated osteoclasts were detected as TRAP-positive multinucleated cells
with dark purple staining in the cytoplasm.

Masson’s trichrome staining
Trichrome staining was performed using Trichome Staining kit from Sigma
Aldrich following manufacturer’s protocol. The cytoplasma was stained in
red and the collagen I was stained as blue.

Immunohistochemical staining of b-PDGFR
Immunohistochemical staining of b-PDGFR was performed on formalinﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded mouse tibiae slides. Antigen retrieval was
performed by using sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.5). Slides were incubated
with anti-b-PDGFR antibody (Calbiochem, cat# PC17, 1:1000) at 41C
overnight and visualized with DAB (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA).
Negative controls were performed using rabbit IgG (Cat# I-1000, 1:1000,
Vector Labs). Meyer’s hematoxylin purchased from SycTek Laboratories,
Inc. (Logan, UT, USA) was used to counterstain nuclei.

In vitro differentiation of preosteoclast-like RAW264.7 cells

Statistical analysis

RAW264.7 cells (1  105/well), grown on glass coverslips in a 12-well plate,
were treated with rPDGF-B, rPDGF-D or RANKL at indicated concentrations
in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS. Each treatment was performed in triplicate
and the medium was refreshed every 2 days. After 6 days, cells were ﬁxed
with 4% paraformaldehyde, and TRAP staining was performed as described
above. Activated osteoclasts, detected as TRAP-positive multinucleated
cells (more than three nuclei/cell), were counted in ﬁve randomly selected
ﬁelds examined at  100 magniﬁcation using a Zeiss Axioplan 2
microscope.

A nonpaired Student’s t-test was used for comparison between two
groups. Po0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Statistical analyses
were based on three independent experiments performed in triplicates.
P values were labeled between groups.

Real-time RT -- PCR analysis

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Total RNA was isolated from RAW264.7 cells at indicated time points using
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The cDNA was synthesized
using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to
manufacturer’s instruction. Real-time PCR was performed using Brilliant
QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), and triplicate samples
were run in the Mx4000 Multiplex Quantitative PCR system (Stratagene)
and analyzed using the 2CT method. Each experiment was repeated at
least three times. Statistical analyses were based on at least three
individual experiments. The forward and reverse primers for TRAP are
50 -TCTCTGGGGGACAATTTCTA-30 and 50 -CTGACTGGCAAAGTCATCTG-30 ,
respectively. GAPDH is used as the internal control. The forward and
reverse primers for GAPDH are 50 -ATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGA-30 and
50 -GCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCA-30 , respectively.

Fractionation of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins
RAW264.7 cells were treated with 1 nM rRANKL, 0.5 nM rPDGF-B or 0.5 nM
rPDGF-D in serum-free DMEM for 3 days. Cells were sequentially lysed with
cytoplasmic lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2,
0.5% NP-40, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma Aldrich), 0.1 M dithiothreitol,
100 mM PMSF) and nuclear lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH7.9, 140 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1% triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, protease inhibitor
cocktail, 0.1 M dithiothreitol and 100 mM PMSF) on ice. Cytoplasmic and
nuclear proteins in the supernatant were collected and analyzed by
immunoblotting, respectively. Densitometry of protein bands was determined using software Image J from National Institute of Health (Bethesda,
MD, USA).

Immunoﬂuorescent staining
RAW264.7 cells, grown on chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International,
Naperville, IL, USA) at 50% conﬂuency overnight, were ﬁxed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 at 4 1C for
10 min. After blocking, cells were stained with primary antibodies and
ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate -conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson
Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA). The nuclei
were stained with DAPI. The slides were then mounted with anti-fade
solution (Invitrogen), followed by immunoﬂuorescence microscopic
analysis using the Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscopy system with a
 40 lens (NA ¼ 1.3).

Generation of concentrated CM from LNCaP-neo and
LNCaP-PDGF-D cells
Equal numbers of LNCaP-neo and LNCaP-PDGF-D cells were seeded into
plastic plates. On the following day, cells were serum starved for 48 h
before CM was collected. CM were concentrated against PBS four times
using Amicon Ultra centrifuge ﬁlters from Millipore. Concentration of
concentrated CM was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay.

Generation of WT PDGF-D and hinge-region mutant PDGF-D
WT and mutant PDGF-D were generated through the vaccinia virus system
by infect/transfect CV-1 cells with vTF-7 virus and pTF-7 - PDGF-D plasmids.
After 18 h, CM containing WT or hinge-region mutated PDGF-D was
collected and concentrated against PBS as described above.
