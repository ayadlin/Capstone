ABSTRACT
Efficacy of Enzalutamide (ENZ) in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
patients is short-lived. Immunotherapy like T cell checkpoint blockade may improve
patient survival. However, when and where checkpoint molecules are expressed in
CRPC and whether immune evasion is a mechanism of ENZ resistance remains unclear.
Thus, we investigated whether clinically relevant immunotherapy targets, specifically
PD-L1/2 , PD-1 and CTLA-4, are upregulated in ENZ resistant (ENZR) patients and
in a pre-clinical model of ENZ resistance. We show for the first time that patients
progressing on ENZ had significantly increased PD-L1/2+ dendritic cells (DC) in blood
compared to those naïve or responding to treatment, and a high frequency of PD-1+T
cells. These data supported our pre-clinical results, in which we found significantly
increased circulating PD-L1/2+ DCs in mice bearing ENZR tumors compared to CRPC,
and ENZR tumors expressed significantly increased levels of tumor-intrinsic PDL1. Importantly, the expression of PD-L1 on ENZR cells, or the ability to modulate
PD-L1/2+ DC frequency, was unique to ENZR cell lines and xenografts that did not
show classical activation of the androgen receptor. Overall, our results suggest
that ENZ resistance is associated with the strong expression of anti-PD-1 therapy
targets in circulating immune cells both in patients and in a pre-clinical model that
is non-AR driven. Further evaluation of the contribution of tumor vs. immune cell
PD-L1 expression in progression of CRPC to anti-androgen resistance and the utility
of monitoring circulating cell PD-L1 pathway activity in CRPC patients to predict
responsiveness to checkpoint immunotherapy, is warranted.

INTRODUCTION

benefits of ENZ are short-lived, and progression on ENZ
is inevitable [1], a phenomenon that can be modelled in
vitro and in vivo [2,3].
While continued dependence on androgen receptor
(AR) signalling in CRPC creates demand for novel
androgen targeted therapies, immunotherapies may
provide a complimentary avenue to improve survival
in men with CRPC, especially in patients resistant to
hormone therapy [4]. Indeed, anti-androgen treatment may
abrogate the tolerogenic effect CRPC can have on local

Therapies targeting tumor-fueling androgens have
been mainstay treatments of advanced prostate cancer
(PCa) for almost 5 decades. However, the inevitable
recurrence of tumors after anti-androgen treatment leads
to incurable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
Recently, a number of new drugs have been approved that
prolong survival in CRPC patients, including the potent
anti-androgen Enzalutamide (ENZ).However, treatment

and systemic immune responses [5]. Thus, intervention
with immunotherapy may be most amenable in patients
that have received anti-androgens, however, selection
and sequencing of effective immunotherapies for CRPC
remains unclear. This is underscored by the discordant
clinical responses observed in trials of CRPC patients
receiving the checkpoint blockade immunotherapies
Ipilimumab vs. anti-PD-1 antibodies, which prevent
CTLA-4 and PD-1 mediated T cell suppression,
respectively. For example, whereas Ipilimumab induced
>50% PSA decline in 8 out of 50 men with metastatic
CRPC [6], anti-PD1 treatment failed to produce an
objective response in a separate small trial of 17 CRPC
patients [7]. These data and the strong correlation between
tumor expression of the PD-1 ligand, PD-L1, and positive
responses to PD-1 blockade in other cancer types have
suggested that the poor results testing anti-PD-1 therapy
in CRPC may be due to the lack of PD-L1 expression in
PCa tumors [7-9]. However, it remains unknown whether
patients with ENZ resistant (ENZR) CRPC may be a
more relevant cohort to study the efficacy of anti-PD-1
therapies, as expression of PD-L1 on ENZ resistant CRPC
and the effects of ENZR tumors on the PD-L1/PD-1
pathway in circulating antigen presenting cells or T cells
has not been reported.
In this study, our objective was to determine
whether clinically relevant immunotherapy targets,
specifically PD-L1/PD-1 and CTLA-4, are upregulated
during ENZ resistant CRPC, both in patients and in a
pre-clinical model. We show for the first time that ENZ
resistance is associated with high frequency of PD-1/L1
therapy targets, not only in the tumor, but in circulating
immune cells. Moreover, our pre-clinical results
suggest that non-AR driven CRPC phenotypes, such as
anaplastic or neuroendocrine cancers, may be especially
immunosuppressive.

those who responded (p=0.0060), or were naïve (p=.0037),
to treatment (Fig.1A). In progressing patients, more PDL1/2+ DCs were associated with poorer response to ENZ
treatment and treatment duration. Men who initially
responded to ENZ with a <50% decrease in PSA had
greater circulating PD-L1/2+ DCs than those who had a
>50% PSA decline after starting treatment (Fig.1B) and, in
progressing patients, PD-L1/2+ DC frequency significantly
increased with time on ENZ (p=.0497) (Fig.1C).
Moreover, in one ENZ progressing patient where serial
samples were taken, PD-L1+ DC frequency increased after
12 weeks of ENZ (Fig.S1). Examination of checkpoint
targets on T cells revealed that although overall frequency
of PD-1+ CD4+ or CD8+ T cells was high, no differences
in T cell PD-1 expression were observed between patient
subsets (Fig.S2A). Comparatively low expression of
CTLA-4 on T cells was found across all patients (Fig.
S2B). Data from this limited cohort suggests that there
is high expression of targetable PD-L/PD-1 pathway
molecules in peripheral blood immune cells in patients
with ENZ resistant CRPC.

PD-L1 is upregulated in a pre-clinical model of
non-AR driven ENZ resistant CRPC
As no matched biopsy specimens were available
from our cohort of patients at time of blood collection,
we turned to our pre-clinical model to address whether
tumor intrinsic PD-L1 expression is associated with ENZ
resistance. RNA sequencing of ENZR cell lines showed
that PD-L1 was markedly upregulated compared to ENZ
sensitive CRPC, and was the most highly expressed B7
family member in the cell line 42D but not in a second
ENZR cell line 49F (Fig.2A). The primary distinction
between ENZR 42D cells compared to 49F is the
activity of the AR; 42D cells express AR but not PSA,
whereas 49F cells express both (Fig.2B). Flow cytometry
confirmed the significantly increased surface expression
of PD-L1 only in two different PSA- ENZR cell lines 42D
(p=0.0195) and 42F (p=0.0079) compared to CRPC, and
not in the PSA+ ENZR cell lines 49C and 49F (Fig.2C).
These results suggest that upregulation of immune
checkpoint molecules may be one unique mechanism of
non-AR driven ENZ resistance.

RESULTS
Progression on ENZ in CRPC patients is
associated with increased frequency of PD-L1/2+
DCs
Expression of PD-L1/PD-1 in circulating innate
immune and T cells is a useful prognostic indicator for
aggressive tumor types and Ipilimumab responses [10,11],
however no such studies have been reported for CRPC.
To determine if PD-L1 pathway targets are increased
after ENZ treatment, PD-L1/2 and PD-1 were assessed by
flow cytometry on DC and T cells isolated from a small
cohort of metastatic CRPC patients who were ENZ naïve
or classified as either “progressing” or “responding” to
ENZ. We observed a significantly increased frequency of
PD-L1/2+ DCs in men progressing on ENZ compared to

Non-AR driven ENZ resistant xenografts increase
circulating PD-L1/2+ DCs in vivo
Our patient data suggested that ENZ resistance is
associated with increases in PD-L1/2+ DCs, and in vitro
PD-L1 is upregulated on PSA- ENZR cells. Functional
suppression of DCs both within the tumor and in the
blood occurs in many cancers via upregulation of PDL1 [12-14], and DC PD-L1 has been linked to tumor
intrinsic PD-L1 expression [8]. Accordingly, we found
235

Non-AR driven ENZ resistant xenografts prevent

that in tumor-bearing mice, PSA- ENZR 42D and 42F
xenografts significantly increased the frequency of PD-L1+
(42D p=0.0014, 42F p=0.145), PD-L2+ (42D p=0.0004,
42F p=0.0190) and PDL-1/2+ DC (42D p=0.0003, 42F
p=0.0189) compared to CRPC or to PSA+ ENZR 49F
xenografts (Fig.3A-C). By contrast, no differences in
PD-L1/2+ DCs were observed comparing PSA+ ENZR
49F to CRPC (Fig.3A-C). These data indicate that PSAENZR tumors strongly alter the expression of PD-L1 and
PD-L2 on circulating DCs and suggest a link between
modulation of tumor intrinsic PD-L1 and DC PD-L1/2 as
a mechanism of ENZ resistance specifically when the AR
is not classically active.

Depending on tumor type, the presence of tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) may indicate responsiveness
to checkpoint blockade [8]. Contrasting our results in
circulating DCs, we found that PSA- ENZR xenografts
significantly reduced the frequency of tumor infiltrating
PD-L1+ (42F p=0.0011), PD-L2+ (42D p=0.359, 42F p=
0.0064) and PDL-1/2+ DC (42D p=0.0422, 42F p=0.0067)
compared to CRPC or to PSA+ ENZR 49F xenografts
(Fig.4A-C). Similar to our previous results, PSA+ ENZR

49F tumors did not prevent infiltration of PD-L expressing
DCs compared to CRPC (Fig.4A-C). Although the
modulation of PD-L1/2+ DC populations differs between
the circulation and tumor itself, our results suggest that in
both locations, PSA- ENZR xenografts modulate DC PDL1/2 expression more than CRPC or PSA+ ENZR cells,
underscoring the potentially immunosuppressive features
of non-AR driven resistant disease.

Despite one CRPC patient showing a complete response
to Ipilimumab [15], in another study there was no
improvement in overall survival for CRPC patients [16]
and no objective responses were observed in 17 CRPC
patients treated with anti-PD-L1 antibody [7]. Moreover,
the positive correlation between tumor PD-L1 expression
and response to PD-1 pathway immunotherapies [8] and
the fact that PD-L1 expression on CRPC tumors has been
hard to identify [7,8], has made justifying the use of PD-1
blockade even more difficult for CRPC patients. However,
the fact that not all patients who respond to PD-1 or PD-L1
therapies exhibit tumor expression of PD-L1, and that only
a very small sample of CRPC tumors have been assessed
for PD-L1 expression [7], suggests a re-examination of

DISCUSSION
The efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade
immunotherapies like Ipilimumab and PD-1 pathway
inhibitors in CRPC patients remains questionable.

the criteria that could define responsiveness to checkpoint
blockade therapies in CRPC patients is required.
In particular, it is essential to assess which immune
evasion strategies are employed by ENZ resistant
tumors that utilize AR re-activation as a main driver of
resistance vs. those that do not. Non-AR driven CRPC
is clinically relevant, as it is has been estimated that up
to 25% of men that die from advanced CRPC have a
disease not driven by the AR [17]. With the increasing
use of potent anti-androgens in the clinic that limit
AR activity but not expression, such as ENZ, there is
increasing concern that more patients may present with

a non-AR driven phenotype of disease. Indeed, most
cases of neuroendocrine prostate cancer, or anaplastic
prostate cancer arise after hormone therapy [18] and the
evolution of an AR- neuroendocrine phenotype from
prostate adenocarcinoma is a proposed mechanism of
anti-androgen resistance [19,20]. Recently, a number of
tumor intrinsic ENZ resistance mechanisms dependent
on the AR have been identified in metastatic CRPC [21],
but differences in immune responses in these patients
were outside the scope of this work. Thus, ours are the
first study to indicate that expression of PD-L1 on tumor
cells may be a unique mechanism of ENZ resistance that

is independent of AR re-activation and not observed in
CRPC. This is in line with reports showing that CRPC
does not express high levels of PD-L1 [7,8]. As tumor
cell expression of PD-L1 is an important prognostic
indicator for tumor regression with anti-PD-1 therapy in
other cancers [8], our results highlight the importance
of investigating the functional ramifications of PD-L1
expression by ENZR tumors as well as tumor expression
of PD-L1 expression in patients on ENZ, particularly in
men with disease that is non-AR driven.
Our results also suggest that ENZ resistant CRPC
may suppress immune responses not only via tumor
intrinsic PD-L1 expression, but also through the induction
of PDL-1/2 and/or PD-1 on circulating innate immune
cells. We show for the first time that patients progressing
on ENZ have significantly higher frequency of PDL1/2+DCs in circulation, which increases with time on
ENZ and was associated with a poorer initial response to
ENZ treatment. These patient data support our pre-clinical
findings, which showed that ENZR xenografts could cause
significant increases in PDL1/2+ DCs in the blood of tumor
bearing mice. Like tumor intrinsic PD-L1 expression, this
was a feature unique to non-AR driven tumors, which are
particularly aggressive in patients [18]. These results are
in accordance with various studies showing that increased
DC PD-L1/2 expression correlates with poor outcome
of aggressive tumors [14] such as glioblastoma [13] and
pancreatic cancer [12].
Although not able to assess T cell populations in
our pre-clinical model, we did find frequencies of PD-1+
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were high in ENZ progressing
patients, however they were similar to patients naïve to or
responding to treatment. These results suggest that DCs
may be a cell population more indicative of changes in
PD-L1 pathway activity as CRPC progresses on ENZ
treatment. However, these results also may be indicative
of the phenotype of T cells in the tumor microenvironment
as well. Although no matched biopsy specimens were
available for our patient cohort, the high frequencies of
circulating PD-1+T cells may be suggestive of high levels
of infiltrating PD-1+ cells in tumors, as this correlation has
been shown in patients with high Gleason grade prostate
cancer as well as renal cancer [22,23]. Since tumor PD-1+T
cells are associated with poor prognosis in both renal cell
[24] and hepatocellular carcinoma [25], our data showing
high levels of PD-1+T cells in advanced CRPC patients
may have important clinical implications.
By contrast to PD-1+ T cell frequencies, we found
that all patients showed relatively low frequencies of
CTLA-4+ T cell subsets. While this observation could
suggest PD-L1 is a more dominant checkpoint pathway
that is activated during ENZR CRPC, it is important to
highlight that responses to Ipilimumab in prostate cancer
patients does not always correlate with high frequency of
CTLA-4+T cells [26] and it is unknown whether expression
of CTLA-4 ligands CD80/86 on antigen presenting cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

correlate with positive or negative responses to CTLA-4
blockade. In addition, despite lack of immune correlates
to suggest an activation of the CTLA-4 pathway, in one
recent publication, a patient with metastatic CRPC showed
complete responses to Ipilimumab [15]. Overall these data
highlight that there may be subsets of CRPC patients that
will respond to either PD-1 or CTLA-4 immunotherapies,
and our data suggest further investigation into circulating
cells as immune correlates of responses may be useful
in predicting response. Indeed, recent evidence suggests
that increased overall survival of prostate cancer patients
treated with Ipilimumab and the vaccine GVAX was
associated with increased with pre-treatment levels of
CTLA-4+ and PD-1+ T cells in circulation [27]. Although
these data contrast an investigation into immune correlates
in PROSTVAC-Ipilimumab treated patients [26], both data
sets support the relevance of surveying peripheral immune
responses in advanced prostate cancer patients to predict
immunotherapy outcome.
Finally, our results suggest a potential third
mechanism for immune evasion during ENZ resistance,
through limiting DC infiltration into the tumor.
Contrasting our results in the blood of tumor bearing
mice, we found that infiltration of PD-L1/2+ DCs was
limited by non-AR driven ENZR tumors. These results
suggest that PSA- ENZR tumors may prevent innate
cell activation and infiltration in the immediate tumor
microenvironment while suppressing the activity of
mature DCs in the periphery. The relevance of TIL
populations to immunotherapy outcomes remains unclear,
as this indicator seems to be dependent on tumor type.
For example, in melanoma, TIL infiltration is a good
prognostic indicator for response to Ipilimumab whereas
no significant relationship has been shown between TIL
infiltration and response to anti-PD-1 therapy in renal,
lung and colorectal cancer [8]. Importantly however,
these IHC studies have assessed both T cell and innate
cell populations, which most likely play distinct roles in
dictating anti-tumor responses during immunotherapy.
Indeed, data showing that prostate cancer patients with
high Gleason score tumors show a strong correlation
between peripheral blood and tumor infiltrating PD-1+ T
cells [23], suggests that the peripheral response still may
be an easily accessible indicator for the activity of the PDL1/PD-1 pathway. Given the difficulty of obtaining tumor
tissue from metastases from CRPC patients, exploring
minimally invasive approaches for interrogating potential
circulating biomarkers (PD-L1/2+ DCs and PD-1+ T cells)
and how they correlate to tumor PD-L1 expression is
especially attractive.w
Taken together, our data suggest that ENZR CRPC
in mouse models and patients is associated with strong
expression of the targets for anti-PD-1 therapy. Moreover,
our pre-clinical data underscores the potentially disparate
immunomodulatory effects of AR-driven vs. non-driven
ENZR tumors, which may add to establishing a predictive
239

signature of resistance to ENZ [28] or stratify patient
subsets most amenable to checkpoint blockade. The
clinical relevance of this observation should be more
thoroughly investigated, and future studies that examine
the utility of monitoring circulating cell PD-L1 pathway
activity vs. tumor intrinsic PD-L1 expression in CRPC
patients to predict responsiveness to checkpoint blockade
immunotherapy are warranted.

PSA antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as previously
described [3].

RNA Sequencing/Microarray
RNA-seq was performed cells using Illumina HiSeq
2000 at BGI according to standard protocols. Sequence
data mapping and processing was performed as previously
described, except normalization was performed using
reads per million [19]. Microarray gene expression was
performed as previously described [19] using Agilent
SurePrint G3 Human GE 8x60K slides (Design ID
028004) and analyzed using Agilent GeneSpring 11.5.1
and Ingenuity Knowledge Base (Ingenuity Systems). Two
experimental replicates of ENZR and CRPC cells were
used.

METHODS
Patients
Whole blood was collected for peripheral blood
mononuclear cell (PBMC) isolation from metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients
(median age=73 years, range 61-88) prior to (naïve, n=3)
or after receiving 160 mg PO (by mouth) Enzalutamide
(ENZ) daily for a minimum of 12 weeks. At time of
blood collection, ENZ treated patients were classified as
“responding” or “progressing”. Responding patients (n=4)
had prostate specific antigen (PSA) decline ≥ 50% from
baseline with no evidence of biochemical or radiographic
progression (Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 criteria,
PCWG2 [29]), or clinical progression. Clinical progression
was defined as worsening of disease-related symptoms
necessitating change in anti-neoplastic therapy and/or
decrease in Eastern Cooperate Oncology Group (ECOG)
Performance status ≥ 2 levels [30]. Progressing patients
(n=8) had evidence of biochemical and/or radiographic
(PCWG2 criteria) and/or clinical progression.

Xenograft Studies
CRPC and ENZR tumors were grown and
monitored in castrated male athymic mice (Harlan
Sprague-Dawley, Inc) in the presence or absence of ENZ
as previously described [2,3]. When tumors reached
350mm2 to 650mm2, blood and tumors were harvested
for flow cytometric analysis. All animal procedures were
conducted according to the guidelines of the Canadian
Council on Animal Care.

Flow Cytometry
Cells were removed from plates using 1ml of 1x
Citric Saline for 10min at room temp and washed 1x
in RPMI+10%FBS. Cells from murine whole blood
and tumors were isolated as previously described
[31]. Human PBMCs from whole blood were isolated
using Ficoll Paque Plus (GE Healthcare) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Before antibody addition,
cells were incubated with either mouse Fc block (2.4G2)
or Human Fc Receptor Binding Inhibitor (eBioscience)
for 20min on ice. Flow cytometry staining was performed
using anti-human PD-L1, PD-L2, CD11c (eBioscience),
lineage cocktail (CD3, CD14, CD19, CD20, and CD56Biolegend) or anti-mouse CD11c, PD-L1 (Biolegend), PDL2 (eBioscience) as described [31] followed by staining
with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 506 (eBioscience, per
instructions) and fixation in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA).
Data were acquired (minimum 10K events) on a Canto II
(BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo (TreeStar).

Cell Culture and Western Blotting
Enzalutamide (ENZ) resistant (ENZR) and ENZ
sensitive CRPC cell lines were generated from an in vivo
LNCaP model of CRPC; CRPC cells were derived from
vehicle treated LNCaP tumors that recurred as CRPC
after castration and treated with vehicle control, while
ENZR cells were derived from CRPC tumors treated
with ENZ that recurred [2]. Cell lines derived from
ENZR xenografts were given numerical and alphabetical
designations corresponding to individual tumors and
mice from which they were derived (ENZR 42D, 42F or
49F). Cell lines were tested and authenticated by wholegenome and whole-transcriptome sequencing (Illumina
Genome Analyzer IIx, 2012). Cells were maintained in
RPMI-1640, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL
penicillin-G, 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco), +10uM
ENZ or DMSO vehicle. For flow cytometry, RNA or
protein isolation, cells were seeded at a density of 1M
cells/10mls media and harvested after 72 hours. AR and
PSA levels were assessed by standard SDS-PAGE and
western blotting using anti-androgen receptor (AR) and
