Abstract
Tumor relapse after chemotherapy-induced regression is a
major clinical problem, because it often involves inoperable
metastatic disease. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are
known to limit the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy in preclinical
models of cancer. Here, we report that an alternatively activated
(M2) subpopulation of TAMs (MRC1þTIE2HiCXCR4Hi) accumulate around blood vessels in tumors after chemotherapy, where
they promote tumor revascularization and relapse, in part, via
VEGF-A release. A similar perivascular, M2-related TAM subset
was present in human breast carcinomas and bone metastases
after chemotherapy. Although a small proportion of M2 TAMs
were also present in hypoxic tumor areas, when we genetically
ablated their ability to respond to hypoxia via hypoxia-inducible
factors 1 and 2, tumor relapse was unaffected. TAMs were the
predominant cells expressing immunoreactive CXCR4 in chemo-

Introduction
The regrowth of tumors after treatment with cytotoxic agents
poses a major threat to survival in cancer patients, particularly
those with inoperable primary and/or metastatic tumors as they
often rely heavily on chemotherapy to slow tumor growth and

therapy-treated mouse tumors, with the highest levels expressed
by MRC1þ TAMs clustering around the tumor vasculature. Furthermore, the primary CXCR4 ligand, CXCL12, was upregulated
in these perivascular sites after chemotherapy, where it was
selectively chemotactic for MRC1þ TAMs. Interestingly, HMOX1, a marker of oxidative stress, was also upregulated in perivascular areas after chemotherapy. This enzyme generates carbon
monoxide from the breakdown of heme, a gas known to upregulate CXCL12. Finally, pharmacologic blockade of CXCR4 selectively reduced M2-related TAMs after chemotherapy, especially
those in direct contact with blood vessels, thereby reducing tumor
revascularization and regrowth. Our studies rationalize a strategy
to leverage chemotherapeutic efﬁcacy by selectively targeting this
perivascular, relapse-promoting M2-related TAM cell population.

reduce its burden. The development of resistance results in poor
survival rates for patients with, for example, inoperable pancreatic
or lung cancer, who often survive for less than 12 months after
diagnosis (1, 2). New therapeutic strategies are, therefore, urgently
needed to delay or prevent tumor regrowth after early cycles of
chemotherapy as these would extend life.
Malignant tumors contain various CD11bþ myeloid cells,
including granulocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSC), and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM; ref. 3). The
latter are recruited as monocytes from the peripheral blood, which
are themselves derived from progenitor cells in the bone marrow
(4, 5). After entry into tumors, monocytes differentiate into
macrophages (6) and promote tumor progression by stimulating
tumor invasion, neovascularization and metastasis, and suppressing antitumor immunity (5, 7). TAMs express a broad spectrum
of activation states between the two extreme forms of "classical"
(M1) and "alternative"' (M2) activation, with a tendency toward
the latter (8). M2-skewed TAMs are characterized by their upregulation of various receptors, including the mannose receptor
C-type lectin (MRC1/CD206) and the angiopoietin receptor, TIE2
(9). Indeed, TAMs expressing high levels of these two receptors
have been shown to play an essential role in promoting angiogenesis in untreated mouse tumors (10).
A variety of anticancer therapies have been shown to stimulate
the recruitment of CD11bþ myeloid cells by mouse tumors
(11, 12). For example, TAMs accumulate in mouse tumors after
chemotherapy (13–15), ionizing radiation (16–18), and the
vascular disrupting agent combretastatin-A4-P (CA-4-P; ref. 19).

Importantly, the mononuclear phagocyte growth factor CSF1
(13) and chemokines CCL2 (14) and CXCL12 (16, 19) are
increased in tumors after such anticancer therapies, and can trigger
monocyte recruitment (4, 5). These cells then reduce the efﬁcacy
of chemotherapy by limiting vascular permeability via their
expression of MMP9 (14), promoting resistance to therapyinduced death via their expression of cathepsin serine proteases
(15) and by suppressing the recruitment/activation of cytotoxic
T cells (12, 13).
Considerable evidence has emerged recently for M2-activated macrophages playing an important role in repair and
remodeling after tissue injury. For example, they are prominent in diseased tissues in spinal cord injury, myocardial
infarction, and various forms of renal disease, (20). Furthermore, TAMs with similar phenotypes have been implicated in
tumor relapse after therapies like irradiation and CA-4-P
(17, 19). Although MRC1þ TAMs are increased in MMTVPyMT mammary tumors after doxorubicin treatment (14), the
role of M2 TAMs in tumor relapse after chemotherapy has not
been deﬁned.
Our studies show that MRC1þ TAMs are elevated in mouse
tumors after treatment with various chemotherapeutic agents.
Moreover, this TAM subset was further deﬁned as MRC1Hi
TIE2HiCXCR4HiVEGFAþ and shown to accumulate preferentially
in vascularized, CXCL12-rich regions of tumors after chemotherapy. Blockade of CXCR4 signaling prevented this close association
with the tumor vasculature after chemotherapy, resulting in a
marked delay in subsequent tumor revascularization and relapse.
These ﬁndings suggest that selective targeting of vessel-associated,
M2-skewed TAMs after chemotherapy could increase the relapsefree survival of cancer patients.

Materials and Methods
Mouse studies
To investigate the mechanisms regulating tumor relapse
after chemotherapy, we primarily used the Lewis lung carcinoma model (21) and the MMTV-PyMT model of breast cancer
(15). These syngeneic tumor models respond to chemotherapy
with an initial phase of tumor growth inhibition, followed by
a distinct regrowth phase. Transgenic tumor models were
not considered suitable as their responses to some cytotoxic
agents can be so minimal that a relapse phase is not evident
(13, 22). Furthermore, tumors in these models are often
multifocal making the kinetics of tumor relapse difﬁcult to
assess accurately.
Our mouse studies were conducted in accordance with either
UK Home Ofﬁce regulations (C.E. Lewis/M. Muthana/R.
Hughes), the Veterinary Authorities of the Canton Vaud (M. De
Palma), the institutional standards of the Research Animals
Resource Centre at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre
(J.A. Joyce; New York, NY), and the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine Animal Use Committee (J.W. Pollard). LLC1/cyclophosphamide studies using 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were performed as described previously (21). For LLC1/AMD3100 studies,
AMD3100 was given concurrently (10 mg/kg) with cyclophosphamide, i.p. every day for 7 days. Tumors and organs were
harvested at the indicated times. Mice were treated i.p. with
pimonidazole (60 mg/kg) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd;
100 mg/kg) 2 hours before sacriﬁce to label hypoxia and proliferating cells, respectively.

4T1/paclitaxel studies
Female Balb/c mice (>8 weeks) were orthotopically implanted
with 1  106 4T1 murine mammary adenocarcinoma cells.
Tumors were grown for 10 days before mice were injected i.p.
with either cremaphore or cremophore þ paclitaxel (10 mg/kg)
every 5 days for a total of three doses, the mice were sacriﬁced and
tissues harvested 4 days after the last treatment. Orthotopic
MMTV-PyMT/doxorubicin studies were performed as previously
described (15). Mice bearing implanted tumors were injected i.v.
with a single dose of doxorubicin (5 mg/kg) when at 250 mm3
and sacriﬁced 7 days after therapy.
Monocyte/macrophage-speciﬁc ablation of Vegfa studies
Female Tg(Csf1r-Mer-iCre-Mer)1jwp;Vegfaﬂ/ﬂ) mice (>8 weeks),
shown to speciﬁcally lack the expression of VEGFA in the monocyte/macrophage lineage after treatment with tamoxifen (23), or
Cre-negative litter mates (ages 8 weeksþ), were orthotopically
implanted with the syngeneic MMTV-PyMT cell line F246-6. Vegfa
ﬂoxed mice were the kind gift of Dr. Naploeone Ferrar, Genentech.
Mice with established tumors were treated with a single i.v.
injection of either vehicle (PBS) or doxorubicin (5 mg/kg) and
24 hours later with tamoxifen via their food (3 mg/20 g body
weight/day). Treatment with tamoxifen was then maintained
throughout tumor regrowth. Tumor growth was monitored by
caliper measurements. In the LLC1/TAM adoptive transfer studies,
C57BL/6 mice implanted with LLCs and treated with cyclophosphamide as outline above, 48 hours after the last dose of cyclophosphamide, donor mice were sacriﬁced, their tumors removed,
enzymatically dissociated, and MRC1Hi and MRC1Lo TAMs were
puriﬁed by ﬂow cytometry. Recipient mice were randomized into
three groups and received either 50  103 MRC1Hi TAMs, 50  103
MRC1Lo TAMs, or saline via a 25 mL intratumoral injection. After
injection of these cells or saline, tumor regrowth was then
monitored.
Human breast carcinomas and metastatic bone lesions
Four patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer underwent
neoadjuvant chemotherapy as previously described (24). Residual tumor tissues were collected at the time of surgery (which took
place 21–28 days after the last dose of paclitaxel). Biopsies of bone
metastatic lesions were also obtained from ﬁve advanced breast
cancer patients. All biopsies were obtained under informed consent following procedures approved by the Ottawa Health
Sciences Research Ethics Board. Samples were collected as previously described (25). All biopsies were taken within 6 to 15 days
of treatment with either chemotherapy alone (paclitaxel, docetaxel, or 5-ﬂuoruracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) or without pamidronate.
Immunoﬂuorescence and IHC studies
Frozen tumor sections were blocked with 1% BSA and 5% goat
serum for 30 minutes and incubated with various primary antibodies (Supplementary Table S1), for 1 hour at room temperature. Alexa ﬂuor–conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-rat secondary
antibodies were used with unconjugated primary antibodies. For
BrdUrd staining, DNA in frozen tissue sections was denatured
with 2NHCl for 15 minutes before immunostaining, as described
above. Nuclei in all tumor sections were counterstained with
DAPI. Formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tissues were rehydrated, peroxidase blocked, then antigen retrieved, serum
blocked, and incubated with primary antibodies for 1 to 2 hours.

Macrophages and Tumor Relapse

Primary antibodies were detected with appropriate ABC or Polymer detection kits followed by chromagen staining with DAB.
Distribution of MRC1þ TAMs relative to blood vessels in human
primary breast tumors
The number of MRC1þ TAMs present within a 250-mm radius of
a given blood vessel was counted in six randomly selected areas
per tumor section. Then, within this 250 mm radius, the distance of
each MRC1þ TAM was measured to the nearest vessel and the
number of MRC1þ TAMs within or beyond 150 mm from that
vessel was expressed as a% MRC1þ TAMs within the region being
analyzed. These were deﬁned as "perivascular" or "avascular"
MRC1þ TAM subsets, respectively.
Tumor dissociation/ﬂow-cytometric studies
Tumors were enzymatically dissociated and labeled with antibodies as described previously (9). All antibody incubations were
performed for 1 hour at 4 C. Cell staining analyses and cell sorting
experiments were performed using BD LSRII and BD FACSAria,
respectively.
VEGFA ELISA studies
CD45þCD11bþLy6GF4/80þ TAMs were isolated from three
pooled, dissociated control, and cyclophosphamide-treated LLC1
tumors. One hundred thousand sorted cells were seeded in 100 mL
of medium and cultured overnight. Conditioned medium was
examined for VEFGA release using a mouse VEGFA Quantikine
Sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems).
Chemotaxis assay
MRC1þ/Hi (CD11bþLy6G_F4/80þMRC1Hi) and MRC1/Lo
(CD11bþLy6G_F4/80þMRC1Hi) TAMs were FACSorted from dissociated cyclophosphamide-treated LLC1 tumors and seeded into
Transwell inserts (4 mm pores, VWR International), 50  103 cell per
well. Lower chambers contained either medium alone, medium
supplemented with 10 nmol/L BSA or 10 nmol/L recombinant
murine CXCL12 (100 ng/mL). After an incubation of 6 hours at
37 C, the chambers were dissassembled and the membranes stained
with crystal violet. The upper surface of each Transwell insert was
scraped to remove non-migrated cells before quantiﬁcation.
Quantiﬁcation of spontaneous LLC1 lung metastases
Sections (4 mm thick) were cut from formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded lungs and stained with haemotoxylin and eosin. These
stained sections were imaged using the Aperio slide scanner (Leica
Biosystems), and the number of metastases per section and total
metastatic area quantiﬁed using ImageScope analysis software
(Leica Biosystems).
Statistical analysis
All data represent mean values  SEM. P values of less than 0.05
were considered to be signiﬁcant. All statistical comparisons were
made using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test (paired or
unpaired as appropriate).

Results

lowed by regrowth beginning 7 days after treatment stops (Fig. 1A,
left). Forty-eight hours after the last cyclophosphamide injection
(day 6), LLC1s contained signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) shorter blood
vessels and more hypoxia than size-matched controls (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Consistent with earlier observations for
MMTV-PyMT implants treated with paclitaxel (13), TAMs were
enriched among those leukocytes present in LLC1s 48 hours after
cyclophosphamide (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In addition,
there was a signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) increase in the overall number
of F4/80þ TAMs in cyclophosphamide-treated LLCs compared
with size-matched controls. This was also seen in paclitaxeltreated, orthotopic 4T1 tumors, and doxorubicin-treated orthotopic MMTV-PyMT implants (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
Cyclophosphamide treatment of LLC1s resulted in a signiﬁcant
(P < 0.05) increase in the number of F4/80þ TAMs expressing the
M2-marker, MRC1, relative to size-matched controls. In contrast,
there was a signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) drop in F4/80þ/MRC1 TAMs
after cyclophosphamide (Fig. 1A, right). Also, TAMs from cyclophosphamide-treated LLC1s expressed higher surface MRC1 than
those from size-matched controls (Fig. 1B). Consistent with
previous ﬁndings in untreated mouse tumors (9, 10), MRC1Hi
TAMs in cyclophosphamide-treated LLC1s coexpressed elevated
TIE2 (Fig. 1C and D). A similar increase in MRC1þ TAMs was also
seen in orthotopic 4T1 and MMTV-PyMT implants after paclitaxel
and doxorubicin, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1D). In all
three models, the vast majority of MRC1þ cells F4/80þ TAMs, and
the small number of F4/80MRC1þ (presumably dendritic) cells
were not signiﬁcantly increased after treatment with cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, or doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
BrdUrd uptake was negligible in MRC1þ TAMs in both sizematched control and cyclophosphamide-treated LLC1 tumors,
indicating their nonproliferative status (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
As chemotherapy-induced changes in circulating hematopoietic
stem and progenitor cells (HS/PCs) could, in theory, contribute to
the increase of TAM numbers after therapy, we also performed
dual immunoﬂuorescence labeling for HS/PC markers, c-Kit and
Sca1. Although c-KitþSca1þ cells were detected in the spleens of
LLC1 tumor-bearing mice (positive control for the staining), no
such cells were detected in either control or cyclophosphamidetreated LLC1s (Supplementary Fig. S2C). These data indicate
that the chemotherapy-induced increase in TAMs is most likely
to be due to increased monocyte recruitment rather than the
proliferation of existing TAMs or their differentiation from
recruited HS/PCs.
We then isolated F4/80þMRC1þ/Hi and F4/80þMRC1/Lo
TAMs from cyclophosphamide-treated LLC1 tumors by FACS and
injected them into cyclophosphamide-treated LLC1 tumors in
littermates (Fig. 2A). MRC1þ/Hi TAMs, but not MRC1/Lo TAMs
from treated tumors or TAMs from vehicle-treated tumors, accelerated tumor regrowth after cyclophosphamide. This was accompanied by a signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) increase in the number of
MRC1þ TAMs, CD31þ blood vessels, and a moderate increase in
BrdUrdþ (proliferating) cells in cyclophosphamide-treated LLC1s
receiving MRC1þ/Hi TAMs. Very few (< 1%) of CD45þ leukocytes
contained immunodetectable BrdUrd (Fig. 2B–E).
MRC1þ TAMs are proangiogenic in untreated tumors and
express the important proangiogenic mediator VEGFA (9, 26).
Moreover, myeloid-speciﬁc deletion of VEGFA is known to have
profound effects on the vascularization and progression of
untreated mouse tumors (27). We, therefore, investigated the
role of VEGFA derived from MRC1þ TAMs in tumor-relapse after

chemotherapy. As reported previously in mouse tumors (25),
VEGFA was expressed by both TAMs and other (F4/80) cells in
control LLC1s (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). However,
within 48 hours of the last dose of cyclophosphamide, VEGFA was
expressed almost exclusively by MRC1þ TAMs (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). As the expression of VEGFA was closely associated with
MRC1þ TAMs, and because the latter were more abundant in
cyclophosphamide-treated LLCs (Fig. 3B and C), we postulated
that the macrophage population as a whole found within cyclophosphamide-treated LLCs might be capable of producing higher
levels of VEGFA. Indeed, the release of VEGFA was found to be
signiﬁcantly greater for TAMs sampled from cyclophosphamidetreated LLCs (Fig. 3D).
MDSCs (CD11bþGr1þ) in tumor-bearing mice are also
reported to express MRC1 raising the possibility that some
VEGFA-expressing MRC1þ cells in cyclophosphamide-treated
tumors might have been MDSCs (28). However, we found that

3482 Cancer Res; 75(17) September 1, 2015

both granulocytic (CD45þCD11bþLy6Gþ) and monocytic
(CD45þCD11bþLy6GLy6Cþ) MDSC subsets were depleted
in cyclophosphamide-treated tumors, and that the expression
of MRC1 on monocytic MDSCs was signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
lower than that on TAMs (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Taken
together, these data suggest that MDSCs are unlikely to represent a signiﬁcant proportion of the MRC1Hi cells in our LLC1
tumors.
We previously showed that a subset of TAMs accumulates in
hypoxic areas of untreated mouse and human tumors (29), where
they respond to hypoxia by upregulating hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) 1 and 2 and a wide array of HIF-dependent M2 genes
(30). As we detected some MRC1þ TAMs in the hypoxic regions
of cyclophosphamide-treated LLC1 tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S4A), albeit at much lower numbers than in the well-vascularized, normoxic (PIMO) regions (Fig. 4A), we investigated the
possibility that hypoxia-regulated transcriptional programming

(via HIFs 1 and 2) might contribute to the relapse-promoting
functions of TAMs. LLC1s were implanted into LysMCre/þHIF1ﬂ/ﬂ
or LysMcre/þHIF2ﬂ/ﬂ myeloid-speciﬁc knockout mice and treated
with vehicle or cyclophosphamide. HIF knockout was seen to
have no effect on the number of MRC1þ TAMs in either the
hypoxic or PIMO areas in cyclophosphamide-treated LLC1s, or
on tumor relapse (Supplementary Fig. S4B and S4C). IHC staining
demonstrated a reduction of >90% in TAMs expressing HIF1a or
2a in control LLC1s, conﬁrming high efﬁciency of LysCre-targeted
HIF allele ablation in our mice (Supplementary Fig. S4D). These
data suggest that hypoxia and HIF1/2-regulated transcriptional
programming do not regulate the relapse-promoting functions of
MRC1þ TAMs.

MRC1þ TAMs accumulate in well-vascularized areas of tumors
after chemotherapy in both mouse and human tumors and

Previous studies have shown that MRC1þ TAMs can reside close
to blood vessels in untreated mouse tumors (10). Furthermore,
the aforementioned HIF knockout study demonstrated an
increase in MRC1þ TAMs in PIMO vascularized areas (PIMO
VA) in cyclophosphamide-treated tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S4B). We, therefore, conducted a more detailed immunoﬂuorescence staining analysis of the distribution of these cells in
control and cyclophosphamide-treated LLC1s. This showed that,
although MRC1þ TAMs were evenly distributed between PIMO
VA and PIMOþ hypoxic areas in size-matched control tumors,

there was a signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) increase in the number of F4/
80þMRC1þ TAMs in the former in cyclophosphamide-treated
LLC1s (Fig. 4A). As cyclophosphamide treatment also resulted
in reduced tumor vascularity (Supplementary Fig. S1A), we normalized MRC1þ TAM numbers to CD31þ area in PIMO VA of
control and cyclophosphamide-treated LLC1s. Interestingly, this
showed that the increase in MRC1þ TAMs in PIMO VA is
independent of changes in the vasculature (Fig. 4A, far right).

Further immunoﬂuorescent analysis of 4T1 and PyMT-MMTV
tumors demonstrated a similar increase in the number of
vessel-associated MRC1þ TAMs after treatment with paclitaxel
and doxorubicin, respectively (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, because
the majority of MRC1þ TAMs coexpressed VEGFA in both
control and cyclophosphamide-treated LLCs, this meant that
there was also a signiﬁcant increase in VEGFAþ TAMs in
perivascular areas (Fig. 4C, top). Interestingly, there was also

in cyclophosphamide-treated LLC1 tumors, compared with 78%
in control LLCs (where other cell types were also CXCR4þ
; Fig. 6B). As reported previously (32, 33), LLC1 cells do not
express CXCR4 (Fig. 6A and B). Moreover, less than 1% of CD31þ
blood vessels expressed CXCR4 in cyclophosphamide-treated
tumors (Fig. 6C). MRC1Hi TAMs in both control and cyclophosphamide-treated tumors expressed elevated levels of CXCR4
compared with the MRC1Lo TAMs (Fig. 6D).
These changes in CXCR4þ cells after cyclophosphamide were
accompanied by a marked increase in tumor levels of its ligand,
CXCL12, on day 6 (Fig. 6D, far right). These CXCL12þ cells were
CD31 (Fig. 6E, left) and most likely tumor cells and/or ﬁbroblasts (34). As a hypoxia-inducible gene (35), it was not surprising
to ﬁnd CXCL12 more highly expressed in hypoxic than normoxic
areas of control LLC1 tumors. However, after cyclophosphamide,
tumor levels of HIF1 and -2 were markedly reduced in all areas of
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S6A, i and ii), but CXCL12 was
abundant in both hypoxic and normoxic, vascularized areas
(Supplementary Fig. S6B). This suggested CXCL12 upregulation
by factors other than hypoxia in such tumors.
Cyclophosphamide is known to induce oxidative stress (36), a
cellular response known to regulate the expression of CXCL12
(37), so we investigated the expression of a well-deﬁned marker
for oxidative stress, heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX-1) in control
versus cyclophosphamide-treated tumors. Interestingly, this was
found to be upregulated in perivascular, PIMO, CXCL12-rich
areas of tumors after cyclophosphamide treatment but not in
control tumors (Supplementary Fig. S6C, i and ii). Both MRC1þ
TAMs and MRC1 cells expressed HMOX-1 in these vascularized
areas (Supplementary Fig. S6C, iii).
We then investigated whether CXCL12 might recruit and/or
retain CXCR4þMRC1þ TAMs in LLC1 tumors. First, we showed in
an in vitro chemotaxis assay that CXCL12 is selectively chemotactic
for MRC1þ/Hi TAMs isolated from LLC1 tumors (Fig. 6E, right).
Then we administered cyclophosphamide to LLC1-bearing mice
alone or in combination with the CXCR4 antagonist, plerixafor
(AMD3100; Fig 7A). This was feasible as TAMs were the predominant cell type expressing CXCR4 after cyclophosphamide
(Fig. 6B). CXCR4 blockade signiﬁcantly inhibited cyclophosphamide-induced accumulation of F4/80þ MRC1þ TAMs in the
PIMO VA (while the numbers in PIMOþ areas of LLC1 tumors
were unchanged, as was F4/80þ MRC1 TAMs in either of these
areas) and delayed tumor relapse (Fig. 7A and B; Supplementary
S5B). At day 10 (when tumors had relapsed in the cyclophosphamide alone group), a similar distribution of MRC1þ TAMs
was seen compared with day 6 (the start of the relapse period;
Fig. 7B and C). In addition, tumors administered cyclophosphamide þ AMD3100 contained signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
shorter CD31þ blood vessels, higher levels of hypoxia, and
fewer BrdUrdþ (proliferating) cells than tumors exposed to
cyclophosphamide with the vehicle for AMD3100 (PBS; Fig.
7D; Supplementary Fig. S5C).
We then examined the effect of CXCR4 blockade on the
distribution of MRC1þ TAMs across PIMO VAs in cyclophosphamide-treated tumors. Interestingly, this was found to significantly (P < 0.05) reduce the number of MRC1þ TAMs in direct
contact with the abluminal surface of CD31þ blood vessels
(standardized by CD31þ vessel area as this differed between
cyclophosphamide þ PBS and cyclophosphamide þ AMD3100
groups), and increase them elsewhere in the PIMO VAs (Fig. 7E).
These data suggest that CXCR4 regulates the direct association of

3488 Cancer Res; 75(17) September 1, 2015

alternatively activated TAMs with blood vessels in cyclophosphamide-treated LLC1s.
A recent study demonstrated a marked rebound in the growth
of pulmonary metastases after treatment with an antibody to
CCL2 (38). This was the result of increased mobilization of
monocytes from the bone marrow after CCL2 inhibition, and
increased blood vessel formation and cancer cell proliferation in
the lungs. We, therefore, investigated the possibility of a similar
rebound effect after CXCR4 inhibition using AMD3100 as this
could disrupt the bone marrow niche. When we extended the
length of the AMD3100 experiment, primary LLC1 tumors
relapsed eventually, but not at an accelerated rate, and mice
receiving cyclophosphamide þ AMD3100 showed increased survival compared with those in the cyclophosphamide alone group
(or controls). Importantly, there was also no rebound in pulmonary metastases (Supplementary Fig. S8).

Discussion
Our studies show that M2-skewed TAMs (MRC1þTIE2þCXCR4HiVEGFAþ) selectively accumulate in vascularized, welloxygenated areas of LLC1 tumors after treatment with cyclophosphamide. A similar increase in such vessel-associated, M2-skewed
TAMs was also seen in orthotopic 4T1 and MMTV-PyMT implants
after treatment with paclitaxel and doxorubicin, respectively, and
in human breast carcinomas after neoadjuvant treatment with
paclitaxel. This perivascular accumulation was found to be
CXCR4-dependent, especially the increased, direct contact of this
TAM subset with the abluminal surface of blood vessels in
chemotherapy-treated tumors. When this was disrupted using a
CXCR4 inhibitor, tumor revascularization and regrowth after
chemotherapy were markedly impaired. We also show, using an
inducible, macrophage-speciﬁc, gene knockdown model that
VEGFA expressed by such MRC1þ TAMs mediates, in part, their
ability to promote tumor relapse after therapy. Consistent with
this, genetic deletion of HIF signaling in TAMs in hypoxic tumor
areas had no effect on this rescue.
The mobilization and accumulation in tumors, of such
BMDCs as myelomonocytic cells, MDSCs, endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) and macrophages after various forms of anticancer therapy are now well established (13–19, 39, 40).
However, our data show that M2-skewed TAMs represent a
signiﬁcant proportion of such BMDCs in tumors after chemotherapy, and is not accompanied by TAM proliferation or
increased numbers of stem/progenitor cells. These data suggest
that increased recruitment of circulating monocytes precedes
the accumulation of such M2 TAMs in tumors after chemotherapy. It remains to be seen whether monocytes are already
M2-skewed upon arrival in treated tumors and/or activated by
factors produced in the perivascular niche. Of note, the recruitment, activation, and perivascular retention of these cells does
not appear to be just an acute response to chemotherapyinduced tumor damage, as increased numbers of perivascular
M2 TAMs persisted throughout the relapse phase.
Our observations suggest that the accumulation of MRC1þ
VEGFAþ TAMs on and around the tumor vasculature plays an
important part in tumor revascularization and relapse after chemotherapy. Furthermore, this was accompanied by a marked
change in the pattern of CXCL12 expression in tumors. Although
CXCL12 was mainly conﬁned to hypoxic areas of control tumors,
it was upregulated in vascularized, well-oxygenated areas after

chemotherapy. This correlated with an increase in the expression
of the enzyme, HMOX-1, a marker of oxidative stress, in such
perivascular areas. Cytotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide
induce oxidative stress in tumors (41), which activates cellular
expression of HMOX-1. This, in turn, generates carbon monoxide
from the breakdown of heme, a gas known to upregulate both
CXCL12 and VEGFA in neighboring cells (37). Interestingly,
HMOX-1 also regulates expression of MRC1 by macrophages
(42). So, chemotherapy induction of this stress pathway in
perivascular areas could both retain TAMs via local CXCL12
induction, and upregulate their expression of VEGFA and MRC1.
Interestingly, the CXCL12-induced retention of myeloid cells
around the vasculature is also essential to the process of neovascularization in nonmalignant tissues (43).
Other factors may also contribute to the retention of MRC1þ
TAMs. Our observation that MRC1þ TAMs expressed elevated

TIE2 suggests that ANGPT2 expressed by the tumor endothelium (44) might also be involved. Indeed, ANGPT2 has an
established role in retaining vascular modulatory myeloid
cells in proximity to the vasculature in progressing mouse
tumors (26).
In untreated mouse tumors, perivascular M2-skewed TAMs
have an established vascular modulatory role and facilitate
tumor growth and progression (26). Our observation that
chemotherapy induces the accumulation of MRC1þVEGFAþ
TAMs around tumor blood vessels strongly infers a proangiogenic role for these cells. This is supported by our ﬁnding that
pharmacologic inhibition of their chemotherapy-induced accumulation resulted in reduced subsequent tumor revascularization. Furthermore, in doxorubicin-treated, MMTV-PyMT tumor
implants VEGFA was found to be expressed predominantly by
MRC1þ TAMs, consistent with our previous ﬁnding that TAMs

are a major source of VEGFA in MMTV-PyMT tumors (31). The
selective ablation of VEGFA in MRC1þ TAMs resulted in
delayed tumor relapse, post-therapy. However, PyMT tumors
still relapsed, albeit at a reduced rate, in the absence of TAMderived VEGFA, indicating that other TAM-derived factors may
also contribute to tumor relapse and/or the possible induction
of resistance mechanisms in tumors to VEGFA knockout. The
presence of the latter has been demonstrated in tumors after
anti-VEGFA therapy and shown to include increased expression
of such alternative proangiogenic mediators as FGF2 (45),
ANGPT2 (46), or PlGF (47) and the recruitment of tumorpromoting, CD11bþ Gr1þ myeloid cells (48).
Recently, the Condeelis group has used intravital imaging to
characterize a distinct subset of perivascular TAMs in untreated
mouse tumors that make contact with endothelial cells and tumor
cells expressing high levels of Mena (a protein that enhances their
motility), and directly stimulate tumor cell intravasation (49).
These cell trios have been termed "tumor microenvironments of
metastasis" (TMEM). It is possible that some of the perivascular
MRC1þ M2-skewed TAMs accumulating around tumor blood
vessels after chemotherapy form TMEMs and promote metastasis
as well as relapse, a dangerous combination in patients with
inoperable tumors.
The effect of CXCR4 blockade on tumor relapse after chemotherapy in our study suggests that CXCR4 inhibitors might be
successfully combined with chemotherapy. This combination
could extend relapse-free survival in patients with inoperable
tumors, although our data suggests that multiple rounds of the
inhibitor would have to be administered to maintain a suppressive effect on relapse. Such sustained use of a CXCR4 antagonist
after chemotherapy could conceivably disrupt the marrow niche.
However, this is unlikely to lead to clinical problems as a recent,
ﬁrst-in-human clinical trial has shown that repeated daily injections of the CXCR4 antagonist, LY2510924 over a number of
consecutive, 28-day cycles was well tolerated in advanced cancer
patients (50).

Taken together, our data suggest that the selective targeting of
relapse-promoting, perivascular TAMs could delay the relapse of
both primary and metastatic tumors in patients after chemotherapy, thereby extending their relapse-free survival.
