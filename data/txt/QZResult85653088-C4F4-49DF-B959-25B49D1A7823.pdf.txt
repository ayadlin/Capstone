Abstract
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptotic cell death in a variety of
tumor cells without significant cytotoxicity on normal cells.
However, many cancer cells with apoptotic defects are
resistant to treatment with TRAIL alone, limiting its potential
as an anticancer therapeutic. Here, we report on the tumoricidal activity of a human single-chain fragment variable,
HW1, which specifically binds to TRAIL receptor 2 (TR2)
without competing with TRAIL for the binding. HW1
treatment as a single agent induces autophagic cell death in
a variety of both TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant cancer
cells, but exhibits much less cytotoxicity on normal cells. The
HW1-induced autophagic cell death was inhibited by an
autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine, or by RNA interference
knockdown of Beclin-1 and Atg7. We also show that the HW1mediated autophagic cell death occurs predominantly via the
c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway in a caspase-independent
manner. Analysis of the death-inducing signaling complex
induced by HW1 binding to TR2 exhibits the recruitment of
TNF receptor–associated death domain and TNF receptor–
associated factor 2, but not Fas-associated death domain,
caspase-8, or receptor-interacting protein, which is distinct
from that induced by TRAIL. Our results reveal a novel TR2mediated signaling pathway triggering autophagic cell death
and provides a new strategy for the elimination of cancer cells,
including TRAIL-resistant tumors, through nonapoptotic cell
death. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7327–34]

Introduction
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) and its associated receptors (TRAIL-R/TR) are attractive
targets for cancer therapy as they can kill tumor cells with little
cytotoxicity on normal cells in vitro and in vivo through the
p53-independent extrinsic apoptotic pathway (1–3). TR1 (TRAILR1/DR4) and TR2 (TRAIL-R2/DR5) contain a cytoplasmic death
domain that triggers apoptosis upon TRAIL binding, whereas TR3

(TRAIL-R3/DcR1) and TR4 (TRAIL-R4/DcR2) lack such a functional
death domain (reviewed in ref. 2). TRAIL binding to TR1 or TR2
results in conformational changes of the receptor that promote the
formation of death-inducing signaling complexes (DISC), which
consists of receptors, Fas-associated death domains (FADD), and
activated caspase-8 and/or caspase-10 to trigger apoptosis
signaling (2). However, many highly malignant tumor cells (>50%)
even expressing TR1 and/or TR2 remain resistant to TRAILinduced apoptosis, the underlying mechanism of which has been
poorly understood and varies with the cellular context (4, 5).
TRAIL-resistant cells become sensitized to apoptotic cell death via
a combination of TRAIL with either chemotherapeutic agents or
irradiation (6–10). A number of agonistic monoclonal antibodies
(mAb) that specifically target TR1 or TR2 have been isolated to
induce apoptotic cell death in multiple tumor cell types, and some
of these also exhibit minimal cytotoxicity on normal cells (11–16).
However, all of the TR1- or TR2-specific mAbs reported thus far
have shown tumoricidal activities as a single agent in most TRAILsensitive cells, but not in TRAIL-resistant cells (12, 13). Thus, the
isolation of agonistic mAbs that are cytotoxic to TRAIL-resistant
cells but not to normal cells is highly desirable for developing novel
cancer therapeutics.
When stimulated by either TRAIL or agonistic mAbs, TR1 and/or
TR2 can mediate apoptotic cell death in most TRAIL-sensitive cancer
cells predominantly through the sequential activation of caspases
(2, 12, 15). Depending on the external stimuli and specific cell types,
TR1 and/or TR2 can also transduce multiple cellular signaling
pathways in a caspase-independent manner, including c-Jun NH2terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, although the components of which
remain largely undefined (4, 7, 8, 14, 17). Furthermore, TRAIL can
also induce caspase-independent autophagic cell death in normal
epithelial cells (18) and in the breast cancer cell line MCF-10A (19),
implying that TR1 and/or TR2 are involved in autophagic cell death.
However, the specific roles of TR1 and/or TR2 in autophagic cell
death have not yet been defined. Autophagy is an intracellular
process in which double membrane–bound vesicles encapsulate
cytoplasmic proteins and organelles to degrade by fusion with
lysosomes in response to external stresses (reviewed in refs. 20, 21).
Recent studies have suggested that autophagy is another cell death
pathway that is morphologically distinct from apoptosis (22, 23).
Here, we have characterized the cell death–inducing properties
of an agonistic anti-TR2 single-chain fragment variable (scFv), HW1,
in multiple TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant cancer cell types.
Unlikely with TRAIL and agonistic TR2-specific mAbs previously
reported, HW1 induced autophagic cell death as a single agent
in both TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant cancer cells exhibiting
much less cytotoxicity on normal cells. We also found that
HW1-mediated autophagic cell death occurs predominantly via

caspase-independent JNK activation. DISC analysis showed that
HW1 binding to TR2 induced the recruitment of TNF receptor
(TNFR)–associated death domain (TRADD) and TNFR-associated
factor 2 (TRAF2), but not FADD, caspase-8, or receptor-interacting
protein (RIP), showing that the components of HW1-induced
DISC are distinct from those of TRAIL-induced DISC. These
results provide a potential therapeutic strategy to kill not only
TRAIL-sensitive but also TRAIL-resistant cancer cells through
TR2-mediated autophagic cell death, which is distinct from
TRAIL-mediated apoptotic pathway.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents. Adherent human cancer cell lines, HCT116,
MCF-7, HepG2, DU-145, ZR75-1, and U87MG were purchased from American
Type Culture Collection and grown in DMEM medium supplemented with
10% (v/v) FCS, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL of streptomycin
(Life Technologies Invitrogen). Nonadherent human cancer cell lines, Molt-4
and HL-60, were from American Type Culture Collection and grown in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL
of streptomycin. Normal human hepatocytes and mammary epithelial cells
were purchased from Cambrex BioScience and were cultured under the
recommended conditions. Normal human astrocytes were prepared and
subcultured as described previously (9). Recombinant human TRAIL
(residues 114–281) without any tags were from KOMA Biotech. Soluble
TR2-Fc, TNFR1, and TNFR2 were from R&D Systems, and CD95 was from
Biovision. AlexaFluor633 and AlexaFluor488 labeling kits were from
Molecular Probes. Mouse anti-His6 IgG was from Sigma. The following
rabbit antibodies were used for Western blotting: anti–caspase-3 and anti–
caspase-8 were from Stressgen, Inc.; anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) and anti-FADD were from Upstate Biotechnology; anti–phosphoJNK, anti-JNK, anti–phospho-p38, anti-p38, anti-TRADD, anti-TRAF2, and
anti–h-actin were from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-TR2 was from Koma
Biotech; and anti-RIP was from BD Bioscience.
Biochemical characterizations. Previously, we isolated human scFv
HW14 (281 amino acids, 30.9 kDa) against the extracellular domain of TR2
(TR2-ECD) from a yeast surface–displayed pseudoimmune scFv library (24).
The detailed experimental methods of expression and purification of HW1
(with COOH-terminal FLAG and 6 His tags), TRAIL-His (residues 114–281
with a COOH-terminal 6 His-tag), TRAIL-Flag (residues 114–281 with a
COOH-terminal Flag tag), TR2-ECD, TR1-ECD, TR3-ECD, and TR4-ECD
(25, 26), competitive ELISA (25), size exclusion chromatography (25), and
surface plasmon resonance (SPR; refs. 25, 26) are described in the
Supplementary Data.
Specific binding of HW1 to cell surface–expressed TR2. Plasmids of
T010 and T30 encoding TR2DCD-YFP fusion protein (the cytosolic domain
deleted TR2 fused to yellow fluorescent proteins) and TR4DCD-YFP (the
cytosolic domain deleted TR4 fused to yellow fluorescent proteins),
respectively, were kindly provided by Prof. F.K. Chan (University of
Massachusetts). HCT116 cells were transfected with the respective plasmid
by electroporation (1,000 V and 1,500 AF) using a 0.1-cm diameter capillary
(Digital Biotech, Korea), seeded at a density of 5  104 cells/well in 24-well
plate over glass coverslips and grown for 30 h. The cells were then washed
once with PBS containing 2% FCS and then stained with either Alexa633labeled HW1 (5 Ag/mL) or TRAIL-His (5 Ag/mL) for 30 min at 4jC. The cells
were then washed thrice with 2% FCS and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS for 1 h at 4jC. Images were obtained using a LMS510 model laser
scanning confocal fluorescence microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss).
Cell viability assays. Cells seeded at a density of 1  104 cells/well in
96-well plates were cultured overnight and treated with HW1 or TRAIL in
the absence and presence of the following agents, as specified in the figure

ketone; Santa Cruz Biotechnology], SP600125 (Calbiochem), SB203580
(Sigma), and 3-methyladenine (3-MA; Sigma). Cell viability was analyzed
using a colorimetric MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]–based cell growth determination kit (Sigma; refs. 6, 26).
Transmission electron microscopy. Cells treated with TRAIL-His or
HW1, as specified in the figure legends, were prefixed in Karnovsky’s
solution (2% glutaraldehyde, 1% paraformaldehyde in 100 mmol/L of
sodium cacodylate buffer; pH 7.4) at room temperature for 2 h. The samples
were rinsed with cacodylate buffer, postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and
1.5% potassium ferrocyanide for 1 h, dehydrated through a graded series of
ethanols (50–100%), and then embedded in Poly Bed 812 resin (Pelco).
Ultrathin sections were cut on a Reichert Ultracut E microtome, doublestained with uranyl acetate and then lead citrate, and viewed under an
electron microscope (EM 902A; Carl Zeiss).
Light and fluorescence microscopy. For the analysis of green fluorescent
protein–fused LC3 (GFP-LC3) localization, U87MG cells were transfected
with a plasmid encoding GFP-LC3 (27, 28) kindly provided by Prof. T.
Yoshimori (Osaka University) and stably expressing cells were selected with
changes of media containing 500 Ag/mL of G418. After treatment of the
stable cell lines expressing GFP-LC3 with HW1 (25 Ag/mL, 24 h), images were
obtained under a live fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200M; Carl Zeiss).
The nucleus was stained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride
(DAPI; Vector Laboratories). The images were obtained using a LMS510
model laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss).
The fluorescence images taken and processed using identical settings are
representative of experiments done at least in duplicate.
Western blotting. Cells (3  105 cells/well) were seeded in six-well
plates, grown overnight, and then treated under the conditions specified in
the figure legends. The standard procedure for Western blotting was then
done as described previously (6, 9). The secondary anti-rabbit IgG
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories) was used for
developing by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
RNA interference. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides were
synthesized at Bioneer Co. The mRNA sequences targeted by Beclin-1 and
Atg7 siRNAs were 5¶-CAGUUUGGCACAAUCAAUA-3¶ and 5¶-GGAGUCACAGCUCUUCCUU-3¶, respectively (22). An unrelated siRNA with a sequence
of 5¶-AGACACACGCACUCGUCUC-3¶ was employed as a control. HCT116 or
U87MG cells were transfected with 1 Amol/L of siRNA by electroporation in
a 0.1-cm diameter capillary (Digital Biotech). Transfected cells were
incubated for 48 h at a density of 3  105 cells/well in a six-well plate for
Western blotting using anti-Beclin 1 (Novus Biologicals) or anti-Atg7
antibody (Novus Biologicals). Twenty-four hours posttransfection, the cells
(1  104 cells/well in 96-well plate) were treated with 200 ng/mL of TRAIL
for 2 h or 25 Ag/mL of HW1 for 30 h prior to MTT assay.
Immunoprecipitations. Cells (1  107cells/time point) were left
untreated or treated with 2 Ag/mL of Flag-tagged TRAIL (29) or 25 Ag/mL
of Flag-tagged HW1 for the indicated time periods (see figure legends). The
cells were collected and lysed for 30 min on ice in 1 mL of a lysis buffer
[20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v)
Triton X-100, and 2 mmol/L EDTA] with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche).
After removing cell debris by centrifuging at 15,000  g for 15 min at 4jC, the
cell lysates (800 AL, 15 mg protein) were precipitated with 80 AL of EZview
Red anti-Flag M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) overnight at 4jC. The complexes
were subsequently washed five times with TBS buffer [50 mmol/L Tris,
150 mmol/L NaCl (pH 7.4)], suspended in 20 AL of 2 SDS sample buffer
[125 mmol/L (pH 6.8), 10% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 14.4 mmol/L 2-ME,
and 0.0002% (w/v) BPB], and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.

Results
HW1 specifically binds to TR2 without competition with
TRAIL for the binding. Human scFv HW1 recently isolated

TR2-Mediated Autophagic Cell Death

Flow cytometry analysis of Alexa488-labeled HW1 binding to
endogenous TR2 on HCT116 cells, which overexpressed TR2 on
the cell membrane following pretreatment with sulforaphane (6),
showed a much more enhanced binding activity in the
sulforaphane-treated cells compared with untreated cells, further
indicative of the specific binding activity of HW1 for TR2
(Supplementary Fig. S2A).
HW1 induces cell death in multiple TRAIL-sensitive and
TRAIL-resistant tumor cells with much less cytotoxicity on
normal cells. Tumoricidal activities of HW1 were evaluated using
multiple human cancer cells with different sensitivities to TRAIL.
These included HCT116 (colorectal carcinoma), HL-60 (monocyte
leukemia), Du145 (prostate cancer), and MCF-7 (breast cancer) for
TRAIL-sensitive cells and HepG2 (hepatoma), U87MG (glioma),
Molt-4 (T cell leukemia), and ZR-75-1 (breast cancer) for
TRAIL-resistant cells (4). The cells were incubated with
various concentrations of TRAIL-His (0.008–0.5 Ag/mL) and HW1

serially diluted HW1 at 1.5, 0.75, 0.38, 0.19, and 0.09 Amol/L (from top to
bottom) over a TR2-ECD immobilized surface. D, no competition between HW1
and TRAIL-His for the binding to TR2. ELISA plates coated with TR2-ECD
were incubated with the indicated concentrations of HW1 in the absence or
presence of 20 Ag/mL of TRAIL-His. Points, relative bound fractions of HW1 to
TR2-ECD from experiments done in triplicate; bars, SD. E, specific binding
activity of HW1 for cell surface–expressed TR2. Alexa633-labeled HW1
(5 Ag/mL) was incubated for 30 min at 4jC with HCT116 cells transiently
transfected with TR2DCD-YFP (top ) and TR4DCD-YFP (bottom ), respectively,
and then visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Nuclei were costained
with DAPI. Magnification, 630.

by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 1B). SPR analyses showed
that HW1 bound to TR2-ECD with association and dissociation
rate constants of 2.33 F 0.02  104 (mol/L) 1 s 1 and 4.71 F 0.05 
10 3 s 1, respectively, resulting in a K D value of 202 F 6 nmol/L
(Fig. 1C). However, HW1 bound to neither the homologous ECDs of
TR1, TR3, and TR4, nor the TNF family death receptors of TNFR1,
TNFR2, and CD95 (Supplementary Fig. S1A), which was further
confirmed by ELISA (data not shown). Thus, HW1 specifically
binds to TR2 without cross-reactivity with the other death
receptors. Notably, competitive ELISA showed that HW1 did not
compete with TRAIL-His for the binding to TR2-ECD (Fig. 1D),
suggesting that it recognizes epitopes which do not overlap with
the TRAIL-binding sites on TR2-ECD.
The specific binding activity of HW1 for cell surface–expressed
TR2 was also analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy in
HCT116 cells transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding
TR2DCD-YFP using TR4DCD-YFP as a control (Fig. 1E; ref. 30).
The staining of cells expressing TR2DCD-YFP with Alexa633labeled HW1 at 4jC revealed a discrete colocalization pattern of
HW1 and TR2 along the plasma membrane, similar to the
staining with Alexa633-labeled TRAIL-His. However, HW1 did not
bind to cells expressing TR4DCD-YFP (Fig. 1E), which colocalized
with Alexa633-labeled TRAIL-His on the plasma membrane
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). Upon incubation at 37jC for 5 min,
the colocalized fluorescence signal from the HW1-TR2 complexes
exhibited strong punctuated foci (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
These observations indicate that HW1 specifically binds to TR2
to form oligomeric HW1-TR2 complexes on the cell surface.

(0.008–25 Ag/mL) for the indicated periods specified in the figure
legends. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay (6, 26). All of
the known TRAIL-sensitive cells were susceptible to both TRAILHis– and HW1-mediated cell deaths in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2A, a). DU145 cells were most susceptible to HW1, exhibiting
an EC50 (50% effective concentration) of f100 ng/mL. As
expected, the known TRAIL-resistant cells did not show significant
cell death (<12%) by TRAIL-His treatments of up to 0.5 Ag/mL for
30 h (Fig. 2A, b). Strikingly, however, HW1 exhibited cell-killing
activity for all of these TRAIL-resistant cells in proportion to the
concentration starting from 12 h at >1 Ag/mL (Fig. 2A, b). Cells
dying because of HW1 treatment became rounded and were
detached from the culture plates. The sensitivity to HW1-induced
cell death varied among the cells, with U87MG displaying the
highest susceptibility (EC50  1.5 Ag/mL).
Next, we determined the cytotoxicity of HW1 on normal cells
using human hepatocytes, mammary epithelial cells, and astrocytes
in comparison with non-tagged TRAIL (residues 114–281). Tagged
TRAIL with NH2-terminal 6 His exogenous sequences have
previously exhibited cytotoxicity on normal human hepatocytes
(31), whereas non-tagged TRAIL and some anti-TR2 mAbs have
not (3, 14, 15). HW1 treatment exhibited very low levels of cytotoxicity (V20%) at doses <5 Ag/mL for 30 h incubation in normal
human hepatocytes and mammary epithelial cells, like the nontagged TRAIL (Fig. 2A, c and d). Treatment with 25 Ag/mL of HW1
for 30 h induced f40% cell death in both normal human cells
(Fig. 2A, c and d). However, the cytotoxicity of HW1 for the normal
cells showed far lower levels than for the cancer cells tested under
the same conditions (Fig. 2A). For normal human astrocytes, HW1
did not show any cytotoxicity even up to 40 Ag/mL for 48 h incubation (data not shown). Thus, HW1 exhibited much less cytotoxicity on normal human cells compared with multiple cancer cells.
Whether HW1 induced cell death through specific binding to TR2
was assessed using a soluble competitor of TR2-Fc–conjugated

protein (TR2-ECD fused to the constant region of the immunoglobulin) for cell surface–expressed TR2. Cell death in HCT116 cells
mediated by either HW1 or TRAIL-His was gradually inhibited with
increased concentrations of TR2-Fc (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, HW1
showed enhanced cell death activity for HCT116 cells with TR2
overexpressed by pretreatment with sulforaphane, compared with
the untreated control cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B). These results
showed that HW1 specifically transduces cell death signaling
through TR2.
Some bivalent TR2-specific IgG mAbs induced apoptotic cell
death as a single agent (11, 14, 15), but their respective monovalent
Fab forms could not (16, 32), indicating that the oligomerization of
TR2 is required to recruit and activate subsequent molecules
involved in cell death, like other TNFRs (2). However, monovalent
scFv HW1 induced cell death in the absence of secondary crosslinking agents. Even cross-linking of 6 His-tagged-HW1 using
mouse anti-His6 IgG did not augment the cell death activity in
HCT116 and HepG2 cells examined (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the crosslinking of TRAIL-His under the same conditions showed significantly enhanced killing activity in HCT116 cells (data not shown),
consistent with previous results (1, 32).
HW1 induces autophagy in both TRAIL-sensitive and TRAILresistant tumor cells. The tumoricidal activity of HW1, even
for TRAIL-resistant cells, prompted us to characterize the
associated cell death morphology by transmission electron
microscopy. Compared with untreated cells exhibiting normal
nuclear and cytoplasmic morphology (Fig. 3A, top), TRAIL-sensitive
HCT116 and Du145 cells treated with TRAIL-His showed typical
characteristics of apoptotic cell deaths, such as nuclear shrinkage,
chromatin condensation, and membrane blebbing (Fig. 3A, bottom;
refs. 20, 21). However, HW1-treated cells exhibited numerous
membrane-bound vesicles occupying the major cytoplasmic space
(>90%), which frequently contained electron-dense materials of
cytoplasmic fragments and organelles, such as entire or damaged

associated with autophagy (20, 21). Higher magnification of
images clearly revealed multiple or double membrane–bound
autophagosomes with fragmented cellular organelles and debris
inside (Fig. 3B, left and middle; refs. 19–21). Simultaneously, autohagosome induction stages where membrane-bound vacuoles
surround mitochondria and autophagosome fusion with autophagic vacuoles were also observed (Fig. 3B, right). The dying cells by
HW1 treatment also exhibited common characteristics of apoptosis and autophagy, such as shrunk nuclei, partial chromatin
condensation, and membrane blebbing (Fig. 3A, middle; refs.
20, 21).
Another distinctive hallmark of autophagy is the translocation of
LC3 from the cytosol to the autophagic vacuoles (27, 28). When
TRAIL-resistant U87MG cells stably expressing GFP-LC3 were incubated with HW1, the accumulation of GFP-LC3 was observed both
around and inside the autophagic vacuoles, with strong discrete dots
as shown by confocal fluorescence microscopy, compared with
untreated cells (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, when the HW1-induced dying
cells of HCT116 and U87MG were stained with lysotracker red, which

www.aacrjournals.org

accumulates in acidic vesicles (20, 21), they exhibited numerous
punctuate staining patterns, compared with untreated cells exhibiting only very weak diffuse staining (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B).
This supports the cytosolic accumulation of autophagic vacuoles.
To determine whether autophagy was responsible for the HW1induced cell death, the effect of 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor (21),
on the HW1-induced cell death was evaluated. Pretreatment of
HCT116 and U87MG cells with 3-MA (50 Amol/L) significantly
abolished the cytosolic accumulation of autophagic vacuoles
monitored by lysotracker red staining (Supplementary Fig. S3A
and B) and completely suppressed the HW1-induced cell death at
125 Amol/L (Fig. 5B), such as the TRAIL-mediated autophagic cell
death of epithelial cancer cells (19). Furthermore, long-term
clonogenic assays showed that inhibiting the HW1-induced
autophagic cell death of HCT116 cells by 3-MA rescued the
colony-forming ability of the cells (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Several autophagy-related (Atg ) genes, including Beclin-1 and
Atg7, have been known to be associated with the autophagic
pathway (20–22). To determine whether Beclin-1 and/or Atg7
were involved in HW1-induced cell death, we reduced the
expression of Beclin-1 and Atg7 by RNA interference in TRAILsensitive HCT116 and TRAIL-resistant U87MG cells before HW1
treatment (Fig. 4). The significantly suppressed expression of the
two respective genes by siRNA caused a dramatic inhibition of
the HW1-induced cell death in both HCT116 and U87MG cells,
but exhibited negligible effects on TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity in
HCT116 cells, compared with cells untreated or treated with the
unrelated siRNA (Fig. 4). This result suggested that Atg7 and
Beclin-1 are closely associated with the HW1-induced autophagic
cell death, consistent with typical autophagic cell death (20–22,
33). Taken together, we concluded that HW1 induces autophagic
cell death not only in TRAIL-sensitive cancer cells, but also in
TRAIL-resistant cancer cells.
HW1-induced autophagic cell death occurs mainly through
the JNK pathway. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying HW1induced cell death, activation of some participants involved in cell
death were monitored by Western blotting in TRAIL-sensitive
HCT116 and TRAIL-resistant U87MG cells. Caspase-3, caspase-8,
and PARP were significantly cleaved from their pro-forms in
HCT116 cells treated with TRAIL-His for 2 h, but was very slightly
cleaved in both HCT116 and U87MG cells treated with HW1 for the
various time periods (Fig. 5A). Instead, compared with TRAIL-His–
treated or untreated control cells, HW1-treated cells exhibited
significant activations of both JNK and p38 by at least 3-fold
starting from 12 h, which closely paralleled the time course of cell
death in both cells (Fig. 5A). We then examined further whether
caspases, JNK, or p38 plays a critical role in HW1-induced
autophagic cell death, using their specific inhibitors. The pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD (10 Amol/L) completely blocked the
cleavage of PARP by caspase-3 and cell death in HCT116 cells
treated with TRAIL-His (Fig. 5B–D). However, for HW1-treated
HCT116 and U87MG cells, Z-VAD did not attenuate JNK
activations at all and only slightly reduced the cell death
(Fig. 5B–D), indicating that HW1-mediated JNK activation and
cell death occur independently of caspase activations. The p38
inhibitor SB203580 (10 Amol/L) efficiently inhibited HW1-mediated
p38 activation, but not JNK activation, resulting in only a slight
reduction in the HW1-induced cell death (Fig. 5B and D). Hence,
even though p38 was significantly activated in HW1-treated cells
(Fig. 5A), its activation was not essential for HW1-induced cell
death. Strikingly, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (10 Amol/L), which

efficiently inhibited JNK activations, completely suppressed HW1mediated cell death in both TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant
cells (Fig. 5B and D), indicating an essential requirement of JNK
activation in HW1-mediated cell death. Furthermore, blocking the
cell death of HCT116 cells induced by HW1 with the JNK inhibitor
SP600125 efficiently rescued the colony-forming capability of the
cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). 3-MA (50 Amol/L) did not inhibit
JNK activations, but completely blocked the HW1-stimulated cell
death at 125 Amol/L (Fig. 5B and D), suggesting that it attenuates
autophagic cell death by operating downstream of JNK activation.
The HCT116 and U87MG cells dying because of HW1 in the
presence of Z-VAD or SB203580, but not with SP600125 or 3-MA,
exhibited numerous punctuate lysotracker red stainings (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicative of the accumulation of autophagic
vacuoles, and thus, autophagic cell death. The inhibitors against
JNK, p38, and autophagy (3-MA) did not affect the TRAIL-induced
cell death at all in HCT116 cells (Fig. 5B), whereas Z-VAD almost
blocked it (Fig. 5B and C). Taken together, the results showed that

the specific inhibitors of JNK and autophagy (3-MA), but not of
caspases and p38, effectively protected both TRAIL-sensitive and
TRAIL-resistant tumor cells from the HW1-induced autophagic cell
death, consistent with the Z-VAD–mediated autophagic cell death
of L929 fibroblastic cells (22).
To further understand the role of JNK in HW1-induced cell
death, we transiently transfected HCT116 and U87MG cells with
wild-type JNK2 (wtJNK2) or dominant-negative JNK2 mutant
(dnJNK2) to modulate JNK activity. The expression of these two
respective proteins in both cells was confirmed by Western
blotting using anti-JNK antibody (Supplementary Fig. S5). The
ectopic expression of dnJNK2 significantly inhibited the HW1induced cell death in both cells, whereas that of wtJNK2 showed
the opposite effect of slightly enhancing the HW1-mediated cell
death, compared with control cells transfected with an empty
vector and then treated with HW1 (Supplementary Fig. S5). This
result, together with that of the JNK inhibitor, indicated that JNK
activation is required for the HW1-induced autophagic cell death.

Figure 5. HW1-induced autophagic cell death occurs predominantly via JNK activation in a caspase-independent manner in both TRAIL-sensitive HCT116 and
TRAIL-resistant U87MG cells. A, HW1 treatment slightly activates caspases, but significantly activates JNK and p38 in both HCT116 and U87MG cells. Cells were
left untreated (Control ), or treated with either 0.2 Ag/mL of TRAIL-His for 2 h or with 25 Ag/mL of HW1 for the indicated periods, and then whole cell lysates were
prepared and subjected to Western blotting. B, effects of various inhibitors on the cell death of HCT116 and U87MG cells treated with either HW1 or TRAIL-His.
Cells pretreated for 1 h with Z-VAD (10 Amol/L), SB203580 (10 Amol/L), SP600125 (10 Amol/L), or 3-MA (50 and 125 Amol/L) were further incubated with either
0.2 Ag/mL of TRAIL-His in HCT116 for 5 h and U87MG cells for 30 h or 25 Ag/mL of HW1 in both cells for 30 h. C, no significant effects of Z-VAD on the cell
death of HCT116 cells and U87MG cells induced by varying concentrations of HW1. Cells pretreated with 10 Amol/L of Z-VAD for 1 h were further incubated with
the indicated concentrations of TRAIL-His (8 h) or HW1 (30 h) in HCT116 cells and HW1 (30 h) in U87MG cells. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay;
percentages of viable cells compared with untreated control cells (columns, B; and points, C ) from experiments done at least in triplicate; bars, SD. D, effects of various

TR2-Mediated Autophagic Cell Death

Figure 6. HW1 induces a different DISC from that of TRAIL in TRAIL-sensitive
HCT116 (left) and TRAIL-resistant U87MG (right ) cells. Cells were treated
with 2 Ag/mL of Flag-tagged TRAIL for 30 min (only for HCT116 cells) or
25 Ag/mL of Flag-tagged HW1 for 30 or 360 min, and lysed. The TR2-associated
DISC was coimmunoprecipitated from the lysates using anti-Flag antibody
and analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of TR2, FADD, caspase-8,
TRADD, RIP, and/or TRAF2. The addition of beads alone to unstimulated
cell lysates (Control ) was used to control for nonspecific interactions.

TRADD and TRAF2, but not FADD, caspase-8, or RIP, are
recruited to the HW1-TR2 signaling complex. To elucidate the
molecular components involved in HW1 signaling through TR2,
we analyzed DISC associated with HW1-TR2 complex by
immunoprecipitation after Flag-tagged HW1 treatment of
HCT116 and U87MG cells, compared with Flag-tagged TRAIL
treatment (Fig. 6). The TR2-associated DISC was coimmunoprecipitated from the cell lysates using anti-Flag antibody and
analyzed by Western blotting. TRAIL stimulated a DISC assembly
containing TR2, FADD, and caspase-8, but not RIP, TRADD, or
TRAF2 in HCT116 cells, consistent with the previous results (29).
However, HW1 induced a DISC composed of TR2, TRADD, and
TRAF2, whereas FADD, caspase-8, and RIP were not detected in
the TR2-associated complex in both HCT116 and U87MG cells
(Fig. 6). This result suggested that HW1 binding may lead to the
recruitment of TRADD into the intracellular death domain of
TR2, and subsequent association of TRADD with TRAF2, which
seems to trigger subsequent signaling for the JNK activation (34).
Taken together, our data suggested that HW1 triggers autophagic
cell death by forming a distinct DISC from that of TRAIL.

Discussion
TRAIL or agonistic anti-TR2 mAbs induce apoptotic cell death
in various cancer cells, but was not sufficient as a single agent to
kill TRAIL-resistant tumor cells, which can be sensitized to cell
death by combined therapy with chemotherapeutics (6–12). We
showed here that HW1 alone can induce autophagic cell death in
both TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant cancer cells in vitro
with much less cytotoxicity to normal cells. The tumoricidal
activity of TR2-specific HW1 was blocked by the soluble TR2-Fc
and augmented by TR2 overexpression on the cell surface,
suggesting that TR2-mediated extrinsic signaling is sufficient to
kill various tumors, including TRAIL-resistant cells, through the
distinct cell death pathway of autophagy from apoptosis. This is
indirectly supported by the TRAIL-mediated autophagic cell
death of normal epithelial cells (18, 19). Similar to typical
autophagy (20–22), two key autophagy genes, Beclin-1 and Atg7,

www.aacrjournals.org

seem to be involved in HW1-induced autophagic cell death.
Although TRAIL induced apoptotic cell death in TRAIL-sensitive
cells via the caspase-dependent pathway, HW1 triggered autophagic cell death in both TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant
tumors predominantly through the JNK pathway in a caspaseindependent manner. Caspase-independent JNK activation has
been reported to contribute to autophagic cell death induced by
TNF-a (33) and chemicals (22, 35), which, together with our
results, indicates a molecular link between JNK activation and
autophagic cell death. DISC analysis revealed that TRADD and
TRAF2 were recruited to the HW1-TR2 complex, but not FADD
and caspase-8, which are essential for TRAIL-induced apoptotic
cell death. Thus, it is most likely that TRAF2 mediated HW1induced JNK activation, eventually triggering autophagy and
subsequent cell death (22, 33). Even though the detailed
mechanism of how HW1-triggered JNK activation mediates
autophagic cell death is yet to be determined, our study suggests
that induction of autophagic cell death through the JNK pathway
might be one of the strategies to overcome TRAIL-resistance of
tumor cells.
In contrast to previous reports showing that at least the
bivalency of TR2-specific mAbs is required to trigger cell death (12,
14, 16, 32), monovalent HW1 alone induced cell death without
enhanced tumoricidal activity through cross-linking, raising the
question of how it directly activates TR2 to transmit the cell death
signal. Similar to TNFRs (2), preligand assembled oligomeric
complexes of TR2 through lateral interactions of TR2-ECD have
been observed on the cell surface (26, 30). The observed punctuate
colocalization signals upon HW1 binding to TR2 (Fig. 1E;
Supplementary Fig. S1C) indicates the formation of oligomeric
HW1-TR2 complexes on the cell membrane. It is not clear,
however, whether HW1 binds to preassembled homomeric TR2
complexes or to monomeric TR2, and then immediately induces
TR2 clustering. The latter might be feasible due to the different
binding sites of HW1 from those of TRAIL on TR2. In either case,
DISC analysis indicated that HW1 binding to TR2 may induce
different conformations of the TR2 intracellular death domain,
which recruits distinct adaptor molecules of TRADD and TRAF2
from those induced by TRAIL. This distinct DISC assembly seems
to explain the differences in the eventual outcome between HW1
and TRAIL upon binding to the same target TR2. For example, in
contrast with HW1-induced autophagic cell death, TRAIL-resistant
U87MG cells were sensitized to apoptotic cell death by the
combination of TRAIL and the chemotherapeutic agent rottlerin,
which was mediated by caspase activations without any activations of JNK and p38 (9).
The specific role of autophagy in programmed cell death,
whether it is a survival mechanism or another cell death pathway,
has been controversial. However, accumulating evidence suggests
that autophagy represents another cell death pathway in certain
circumstances, which occurs in the absence or presence of
apoptosis (20–23). Most TRAIL-resistant cancer cells have apoptotic defects. For example, antiapoptotic molecules of FLICE-like
inhibitory proteins and Bcl-2 family are overexpressed in TRAILresistant cells (5). Thus, similar to HW1-induced autophagic cell
death, targeting nonapoptotic cell death might be an alternative
strategy to apoptotic cancer therapy for various cancers, particularly for TRAIL-resistant tumors (21, 23). Although we need to
further characterize the tumoricidal activity of HW1 in vivo, our
study shows that TR2-specific HW1 can induce autophagic cell
death in various cancer cell types, including TRAIL-resistant
