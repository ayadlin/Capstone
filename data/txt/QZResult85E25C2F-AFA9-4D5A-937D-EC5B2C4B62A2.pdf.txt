BACKGROUND: On the basis of potential additive or synergistic immunostimulatory antitumor effects, in this phase 1
study, the authors evaluated the combination of sunitinib and tremelimumab (CP-675206; an antibody against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 [CTLA4]) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) was evaluated. METHODS: Adult patients with mRCC who had received 1 previous systemic treatment received
tremelimumab (6 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 15 mg/kg) intravenously once every 12 weeks and oral sunitinib (50 mg daily
for 4 weeks then 2 weeks off or 37.5 mg daily as a continuous dose). The primary objective was to determine the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Secondary objectives were to assess antitumor activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled. Two of 5 patients who received 50 mg sunitinib plus tremelimumab 6 mg/kg experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and no further enrollment to the combination with
sunitinib 50 mg dosing was pursued. Among patients who received continuous sunitinib 37.5 mg daily, 1 of 7 patients
who received tremelimumab 10 mg/kg plus sunitinib suffered a sudden death, and 3 of 6 patients who received tremelimumab 15 mg/kg plus sunitinib experienced DLTs. An expansion cohort (n ¼ 7) was enrolled at tremelimumab 10
mg/kg plus sunitinib 37.5 mg daily; 3 of those patients experienced DLTs. Overall, rapid-onset renal failure was the
most common DLT. Nine of 21 patients who were evaluable for response achieved partial responses (43%; 95% confidence interval, 22%-66%), and 4 of those responses were ongoing at the time of the current report. CONCLUSIONS:
In this study of tremelimumab plus sunitinib, rapid-onset acute renal failure was observed unexpectedly, and further
investigation of tremelimumab doses >6 mg/kg plus sunitinib 37.5 mg daily is not recommended. Preclinical investiC 2010 American

Management options for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) previously were limited to surgical resection or
administration of cytokines, such as interleukin-2 or interferon-alfa (IFN-a). However, both of those cytokines are toxic
when administered at high doses and are associated with clinical benefit in only a limited subset of patients.1 Sunitinib, an
oral, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of signaling through vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and plateletderived growth factor receptor, has antitumor activity in mRCC. Compared with IFN-a, sunitinib significantly prolongs
progression-free survival (PFS) (11 months vs 5 months; P < .001) and significantly increases objective response rates
(31% vs 6%; P < .001).2 In addition to inhibiting angiogenesis, preclinical evidence suggests that sunitinib also may have
immunostimulatory effects.3 Because 1 mechanism through which tumors escape recognition and destruction by the
immune system is believed to be inadequate antigen presentation, treatment with sunitinib may enhance response to
immunotherapy.3 One study in patients with mRCC who received sunitinib at a dose of 50 mg daily demonstrated a

significant improvement in the immunostimulatory, Thelper type 1 response, as indicated by the increased percentage of T cells that IFN-c measured in the peripheral
blood (P ¼ .001) on Day 28 compared with baseline.4
There also was a reduction in the immunosuppressive Thelper type 2 response, as indicated by diminished interleukin-4 production (P ¼ .05) and regulatory T cells.4 In
addition, myeloid-derived suppressor cells were reduced,
and the reduction was correlated with type 1 T-cell augmentation.5 Collectively, these data indicated that sunitinib may modulate antitumor immunity and provided a
rationale for the combination of sunitinib and immunotherapy for mRCC.
Historically, the known immunogenicity of RCC
supported the use of immunotherapy in mRCC.6 Until
recently,2 immunotherapeutic regimens with recombinant human IFN-a2b, used alone or in combination,
were applied.6 The use of cytokines, however, has been
limited by toxicity and generally poor overall response
rates6; and as noted above, PFS was longer and response
rates were higher in patients who received sunitinib than
in patients who received IFN-a.2 However, the rationale
for an immunotherapeutic approach to mRCC treatment
remains.
Tremelimumab (CP-675206) is a fully human
monoclonal antibody that blocks signaling through cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), thus
enhancing T-cell activation and proliferation. Immunotherapy with tremelimumab has been associated with
durable objective responses in patients with metastatic
melanoma.7-10
On the basis of the potential for additive or synergistic immunostimulatory antitumor effects, we hypothesized that the combination of tremelimumab plus
sunitinib might have greater antitumor activity than either
agent alone. Therefore, we investigated the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of tremelimumab in combination with 2 dosing schedules of sunitinib in this phase 1
study of mRCC.

the trial. This trial is registered as National Clinical Trial
NCT00372853 (www.clinicaltrials.gov).
Study Design
In this phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation
study, we evaluated the safety and tolerability of escalating
doses of tremelimumab in combination with sunitinib in
patients with mRCC. Patients received oral sunitinib at a
dose of either 50 mg daily for 4 weeks on an every-6-week
cycle or 37.5 mg daily without any interruptions in combination with intravenous tremelimumab (6 mg/kg, 10
mg/kg, or 15 mg/kg) on Day 1 of every 90-day cycle (every 12 weeks) (Fig. 1). The first cohort of patients received
sunitinib 37.5 mg daily plus 6 mg/kg tremelimumab.
Once that cohort was filled, the next cohort of patients
received 50 mg/kg sunitinib plus 6 mg/kg tremelimumab.
Subsequent cohorts were assigned to the sunitinib dosing
regimen based on the safety observed in the previous
group of patients that received the same sunitinib regimen, whereas the tremelimumab dose was escalated to the
next defined level. Patients were not enrolled in subsequent dose levels until all current dose level patients (3
patients) were observed for at least 6 weeks for possible
dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Patients who did not experience disease progression or intolerable toxicity
received a maximum of 6 tremelimumab infusions. Sunitinib monotherapy could continue after this time point at
the discretion of the treating physician.
In this study, DLTs were defined as any of the following: any grade 4 nonhematologic treatment-related toxicity,
any grade 3 adverse event (AE) despite medical therapy
(except skin rash that did not require immunosuppressive
therapy, hypophosphatemia, or grade 4 uric acid without

760

clinical symptoms), any grade 3 AE that was potentially
immune mediated and involved critical organs, severe hematologic toxicity (grade 4 decrease in neutrophils for 7
days, febrile neutropenia sustained over a 24-hour period,
neutropenic infection, or grade 4 decrease in platelets for
7 days), or the inability to receive at least 75% of the
planned doses of sunitinib because of treatment-related toxicity. Patients who experienced DLTs during the first 6
weeks after the first dose of tremelimumab completed treatment at that level to determine the next dose level; dose
escalation did not occur until all patients at a given level
had been observed for at least 6 weeks.
In this study, we used a standard 3 þ 3 design. If no
DLTs were observed among 3 patients in the first 6 weeks,
then the dose was to be escalated to the next higher level.
If 1 DLT was observed among 3 patients in the first 6
weeks, then 3 additional patients were to receive treatment
at the same dose level. If 1 of those 6 patients experienced
a DLT in the first 6 weeks, then dose escalation was to
continue. If 2 of those 6 patients (33%) experienced a
DLT in the first 6 weeks, then the next lower dose level
was to be considered the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
provided at least 6 patients had been treated and followed
for 6 weeks at that level, and dose escalation would be discontinued. If 2 of 3 to 6 patients (33%) had DLTs during the first 6 weeks at the starting dose level, then further
investigation of tremelimumab in combination with the
relevant dose and schedule of sunitinib was to be halted.
The dose and schedule of sunitinib was based on a
regimen that was approved for use in mRCC (50 mg daily
for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period) and an alternative, continuous daily dosing regimen that was used in a
phase 2 study in patients with RCC.12 The doses of tremelimumab that we tested in the current study were based
on doses that were used on phase 1 and 2 studies in
patients with melanoma.7,10
To provide pharmacokinetic (PK) data with which
to evaluate the effect of tremelimumab administration on
the PK parameters of sunitinib, a cohort of 12 patients
was to be enrolled in an expansion cohort at the MTD. In
this cohort, samples were taken on Day 28 of Cycle 1 to
evaluate the levels of sunitinib and its metabolite. In addition, samples were taken to determine the PK parameters
of tremelimumab on a schedule that would permit the
determination of single-dose parameters. These procedures were planned to evaluate the effect of sunitinib
administration on the PK parameters of tremelimumab.
The expansion cohort also was used to collect further
safety data at the MTD.

Phase 1 TremelimumabþSunitinib in mRCC/Rini et al

The primary objective was to determine the MTD
of tremelimumab when it was administered every 12
weeks in combination with 2 different sunitinib dose regimens. Secondary objectives included assessments of any
preliminary clinical evidence of antitumor activity, safety,
and PK parameters.
Assessments
Baseline screening was performed within 21 days of study
entry and included complete medical history, physical
examination, body weight, ECOG performance status,
ophthalmologic assessment, 12-lead resting electrocardiogram, hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis, clinical
evaluation of autoimmunities, and pregnancy test.
Patients were assessed for AEs at baseline and on Days 1,
14, 28, 42, and 56 during Cycle 1 and on Days 1, 28, and
42 of all subsequent cycles. Computed tomography (CT)
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the chest,
abdomen, and pelvis were obtained to assess tumors at
screening, on Day 42 of Cycle 1, and within 10 days
before each dose of tremelimumab. Scans also were
obtained to confirm any response within 4 weeks of initial
documentation and at the end of treatment or withdrawal
from study. PK parameters were to be assessed in 12
patients from the expansion cohort who received sunitinib
37.5 mg daily and tremelimumab 10 mg/kg every 12
weeks to determine the sunitinib steady state and the 10
mg/kg single-dose tremelimumab PK parameters.13
Statistical Analyses
The 3 þ 3 dose-escalation design was selected to determine the MTD. The sample size for this phase 1 study
was estimated for a typical 3 þ 3 dose-escalation design.
Listings and summary statistics were calculated for continuous variables (eg, means, medians) and for discrete variables (eg, frequency, percentages). Confidence intervals
(CIs) for the median time-to-event endpoints (eg, duration of response, PFS, and overall survival) were calculated
using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.

RESULTS
Patients
In total, 28 patients (21 patients in the main study and 7
patients in an expansion cohort) were enrolled at 4 sites
between December 2006 and January 2009. Most
patients were men (22 of 28 patients; 79%), and were
aged <65 years (18 of 28 patients; 64%). The majority of
patients (26 of 28 patients; 93%) had clear cell histology

exposure. Seventeen patients (61%) had grade 3 or 4 AEs.
In the initial cohort, (sunitinib 50 mg daily plus tremelimumab 6 mg/kg), 2 of 5 patients had DLTs (Table 2).13
These DLTs included grade 3 fatigue/mucositis (n ¼ 1)
and grade 5 perforated diverticula resulting in death (n ¼
1). This exceeded the defined MTD criteria for this regimen, and further exploration of this dosing regimen was
halted. The study then enrolled patients at sunitinib 37.5
mg daily (continuous dosing) plus tremelimumab. None
of the 3 patients who received sunitinib plus 6 mg/kg
tremelimumab experienced DLT, and the tremelimumab
dose was escalated to 10 mg/kg. At this dose level, 1
patient had a DLT (sudden death), and the tremelimumab dose was escalated further. At 15 mg/kg tremelimumab plus sunitinib, 3 of 6 patients (50%) had a defined
DLT. These DLTs included 2 patients with grade 3 renal
events (renal failure and serum creatinine [1 patient each])
and grade 3 dyspnea in a patient who had dyspnea at baseline. Given the frequency and severity of the toxicities
observed, an expansion cohort of 7 patients received sunitinib 37.5 mg daily plus tremelimumab 10 mg/kg, which
was the protocol-defined MTD based on the initial
cohort, to provide additional PK parameters and safety information. Among all 14 patients who received 10 mg/kg
tremelimumab every 12 weeks plus sunitinib 37.5 mg
daily in the initial and expansion cohorts, there were 4
DLTs: renal failure (n ¼ 2), grade 2 colitis (n ¼ 1), and
sudden death (n ¼ 1). The frequency of DLTs, including
renal failures, at this dose level indicated that it was not

762

the MTD based on the prespecified definition in the study
design.

Acute renal failure

Acute renal failure was the most common DLT. The
4 patients who had renal failure had received tremelimumab at the 2 highest dose levels tested: 10 mg/kg and 15
mg/kg every 12 weeks (Table 3).13 The time to onset for
all 4 renal failure events was approximately 2 weeks (median, 14.5 days; range, 11-16 days) after the start of treatment. All patients required extensive medical
management.
The first patient who developed acute renal failure
presented with fever and diarrhea 12 days after treatment
with sunitinib 37.5 mg sunitinib and 15 mg/kg tremelimumab. At baseline, his creatinine level was 1.4 mg/dL,
and this increased to 2.1 mg/dL on Day 12. On study
Day 16, CT scans of the abdomen diagnosed infectious
diverticulitis. The patient’s creatinine level peaked at 7.1
mg/dL on Day 18. Treatment for renal failure was intravenous fluids and bicarbonate supplementation. The
patient recovered completely from infection. Seven
months after going off study, the patient had a creatinine
level of 1.60 mg/dL and was retreated with 50 mg sunitinib (4 weeks on, 2 weeks off 4/2 schedule). After 1 month
of treatment with sunitinib alone, his creatinine level was
1.52 mg/dL. This patient remains on treatment with single-agent sunitinib, and his creatinine levels have ranged
from 1.29 mg/dL to 1.67 mg/dL.

Original Article

The second patient who developed renal failure had
received sunitinib 37.5 mg daily and 15 mg/kg tremelimumab. On study Day 11, he was admitted to hospital
for grade 2 diarrhea and dehydration. Blood and stool cultures were negative. The patient’s creatinine level became
elevated; on study Day 11, his creatinine level was 2.7 mg/
dL, and it rose to a peak of 4.7 mg/dL on study Day 13.
Study drugs were discontinued permanently; and, with
hydration and supportive care, creatinine levels steadily
improved, and the patient recovered to stable condition
with creatinine remaining between 1.6 mg/dL and 2.0
mg/dL. Approximately 4 months after the last dose of
tremelimumab, this patient was rechallenged with sunitinib alone outside of this protocol, because evidence of tumor shrinkage was noted during the combination
treatment. At that time, the patient’s baseline creatinine
had recovered to 1.6 mg/dL. Within 2 weeks of restarting
sunitinib, the patient’s creatinine began to increase. Treatment with sunitinib was discontinued. When creatinine
increased during this rechallenge, an off-study, unplanned
sample was collected for tremelimumab PK analyses. The
sample, which was collected 161 days after treatment with
tremelimumab, had 0.88 lg/mL tremelimumab, which
was within the range expected (median, 1.26 lg/mL;
range, 0-2.52 lg/mL) based on previous studies with single-agent tremelimumab. Therefore, it was the investigator’s opinion that the initial creatinine elevation and renal
failure were secondary to sunitinib treatment.
The third patient who developed renal failure was
admitted to the emergency room 11 days after treatment
with sunitinib 37.5 mg daily and 10 mg/kg tremelimumab. He had moderate-to-severe chills, fever, and a full
body rash. Upon admission, he had an elevated creatinine
level (6.31 mg/dL), thrombocytopenia (51  109/L), and
elevated aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin levels.
No tests were performed to determine whether thrombocytopenia was immune-mediated. His creatinine level
rose to a peak of 9.58 mg/dL during hospitalization. Intravenous fluids and steroids were administered, and dialysis was started. The patient developed an allergic reaction
to the dialysis membrane, and this resulted in atrial fibrillation. Conservative management with rate control and
heparin were used, but the patient went into respiratory
distress and flash pulmonary edema. Intubation relieved
the symptoms, but the patient had aphasia and weakness
on the right side after extubation. An intracerebral hemorrhage was identified. Treatment with anticoagulants
ceased, and the platelet count was maintained at
100,000/lL. Additional treatment with dexamethasone

patient who developed acute renal failure and hypersensitivity reaction. The patient received sunitinib 37.5 mg daily and

urea nitrogen was 37 mg/dL, and calcium was 7.2 mg/dL. The
image shown is from a biopsy of the right kidney, which

and levetiracetam was initiated, and the patient was continued on intermittent dialysis for elevated creatinine.
The patient discontinued the study, withdrew consent,
and still was recovering from the acute renal failure, central nervous system hemorrhage, and thrombocytopenia
at the time of this report. At the time the patient withdrew
consent, the his creatinine level was 3.94 mg/dL, and his
platelet count was 122  109/L.

with fever and dehydration 14 days after treatment with
sunitinib 37.5 mg daily and 10 mg/kg tremelimumab in
the first cycle. The patient’s serum creatinine rose to 3.2
mg/dL. Blood urea nitrogen was 37 mg/dL, and calcium
was 7.2 mg/dL. The patient was hospitalized and underwent a right kidney biopsy, which revealed acute, tubular,
interstitial nephritis with eosinophilia consistent with a
hypersensitivity reaction (Fig. 2). The patient received
amlodipine for hypertension, cefotaxime and cephalexin
for a urinary tract infection, prednisone for interstitial nephritis, and epoietin alfa for anemia. The patient underwent plasmapheresis and hemodialysis for 6 days.
Although the patient still was taking oral medications for
hypertension and interstitial nephritis, he was discharged,
and his serum creatinine recovered to 1.72 mg/dL

approximately 6 weeks later. Within 3 months of discharge, his creatinine level and platelet count had recovered to normal levels of 1.4 mg/dL and >200,000/lL,
respectively. This patient was retreated later with sunitinib
37.5 mg daily alone and continued for 2 full cycles (4
weeks on, 2 weeks off) without developing recurrent toxicity of any clinical significance.
Ten patients had estimated baseline creatinine clearance rates <60 mL per minute, 1 patient had a rate of 60
mL to 65 mL per minute, and 17 patients had rates >65
mL per minute. Estimated creatinine clearance rates for
the patients who developed renal failure were as follows:
first patient, 109.56 mL per minute; second patient,
68.88 mL per minute; third patient, 81.05 mL per minute; and fourth patient, 58.40 mL per minute.
Sudden death

A woman aged 67 years with RCC received 1 cycle
of tremelimumab (10 mg/kg; cumulative dose, 1055 mg)
and sunitinib (37.5 mg daily; cumulative dose, 450 mg).
This patient also received concomitant medications for
several comorbid conditions, including asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and upper respiratory infection. On Day
11, the patient reported cough with sputum production
and sinus congestion, which was treated with oral levofloxacin and homatropine/hydrocodone syrup. On Day
13, the patient was discovered not breathing and was
unresponsive; she was transported to hospital, where she
was pronounced dead. The investigator considered it possible that the patient’s sudden death was related to tremelimumab and sunitinib therapy. However, the patient had
several risk factors for cardiovascular events and was on
multiple relevant therapies. Levofloxacin is a quinolone
known to cause moderate QT prolongation and Torsade
de Pointes (TdP). The combination of levofloxacin and a
diuretic may have caused a reduction in potassium levels,
TdP, and sudden death.
Colitis

A man aged 59 years who received a single dose of
tremelimumab 10 mg/kg and intermittent sunitinib 37.5
mg daily experienced colitis. On Day 28, the patient
developed grade 2 diarrhea, grade 2 fatigue, grade 1 abdominal distention and pain, grade 1 intermittent rectal
bleeding, and grade 1 anorexia. A colonoscopy revealed
diffuse colitis with inflammation; dysplastic polyps,
adenomas, and chronic active colitis were evident on biopsy. In addition to loperamide for diarrhea, the patient
received midazolam and fentanyl. Colitis resolved by Day

40. The investigator considered colitis to be a DLT for
tremelimumab. The patient permanently was discontinued from receiving additional tremelimumab but
resumed sunitinib therapy after his colitis resolved. A partial response that was documented before Cycle 2 was sustained at study Day 90.
Pharmacokinetics
Because the expansion cohort was terminated early, only
the maximum concentration (Cmax) values of tremelimumab after the first dose were determined. Trough concentrations of sunitinib and its active metabolite, SU012662,
that were achieved 28 days after the first dose were analyzed and summarized. The median (range) Cmax value of
tremelimumab after the first dose was 193 lg/mL (range,
168-438 lg/mL) for patients who received 6 mg tremelimumab (n ¼ 4), 230 lg/mL (range, 60-336 lg/mL) for
patients who received 10 mg tremelimumab (n ¼ 12),
and 397 lg/mL (range, 264-428 lg/mL) for patients who
received 15 mg tremelimumab (n ¼ 6). The median
(range) trough concentration of sunitinib and its active
metabolite, SU012662, (combined) on Day 28 was 47.5
ng/mL (range, 4.8-69.2 ng/mL) for patients who received
sunitinib 37.5 mg daily (n ¼ 13) and 49.5 ng/mL (range
11.1-173.2 ng/mL) for patients who received sunitinib 50
mg daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest (n ¼ 4).
In 3 of the 4 patients who developed serious renal events,
the Cmax values for tremelimumab were 251 lg/mL (10
mg/kg tremelimumab), 420 lg/mL (15 mg/kg tremelimumab), and 264 lg/mL (15 mg/kg tremelimumab
dose), respectively. No sample for PK analysis was collected from the fourth patient. Although the data are limited, the serious renal events did not appear to be
associated with high tremelimumab concentrations.
Trough concentrations of sunitinib plus SU012662 were
not available in patients who had serious renal events,
because those events occurred before Day 28, which was
the scheduled sample collection time for sunitinib PK
analyses. Thus, the relation between serious renal events
and sunitinib concentrations could not be assessed.
Efficacy
Nine of 21 patients (43%; 95% CI, 22%-66%) who were
evaluable for response had a partial response to treatment
with tremelimumab plus sunitinib.13 Six of 9 responses
occurred in patients who received 10 mg/kg tremelimumab plus sunitinib 37.5 mg daily (continuous dosing).
The duration of the 6 partial responses ranged from 2.8
months to 18.2 months (4 responses were ongoing at

response of stable disease, and 2 of those patients maintained stable disease for >6 months. Overall, 16 of 21
patients (76%) who were evaluable for response who had
data available had tumor shrinkage in target lesions compared with baseline in at least 1 assessment (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
In the current study, tremelimumab was investigated in
combination with 2 different schedules of sunitinib in
patients with mRCC. In patients with mRCC who
received sunitinib 50 mg daily day for 4 weeks followed
by 2 weeks off, the MTD for tremelimumab every 12
weeks was <6 mg/kg was not defined. In patients with
mRCC who received sunitinib 37.5 mg daily, the MTD
for tremelimumab every 12 weeks was 10 mg/kg; however, based on the unacceptable toxicity experienced in
the expansion cohort, the MTD is not recommended for
phase 2 investigation.
The most common DLT was acute renal failure,
which occurred approximately 2 weeks after starting treatment in both of the highest tremelimumab dosing
cohorts. Currently, there is limited insight into the mechanism of the renal toxicity we observed in this study, particularly because acute renal failure is not a common

766

toxicity for either of the study drugs when administered
alone. In studies of single-agent tremelimumab in nearly
1000 patients, there have been 11 serious AEs of renal failure or similar events (Pfizer; unpublished results). Five of
those events were considered tremelimumab treatmentrelated, and all of them were prerenal failures associated
with diarrhea/hypovolemia and were not a direct drug
effect on the kidney. Five other events were considered
unrelated to treatment with tremelimumab, and an additional event remains under review. Treatment-related
renal failure (grade 3) has been reported in 0.4% of
patients (n ¼ 34) and acute renal failure has been reported
in 0.1% of patients (n ¼ 12) who were treated on previous
studies of sunitinib (N ¼ 8709; Pfizer; unpublished
results). The onset time for these renal toxicities coincided
with the expected time to steady-state concentration for
sunitinib; however, the steady-state levels of sunitinib that
were achieved in combination with tremelimumab were
within the expected range for single-agent sunitinib. Fever
accompanied all acute renal failure events, and this may
have been indicative of an immune-related mechanism.
This limited evidence could support an immune-mediated interaction between sunitinib and tremelimumab.
It was possible to determine only the tremelimumab
Cmax values and the sunitinib trough values from the limited samples that were available in this study. Trough concentrations of sunitinib plus SU012662 and Cmax values
of tremelimumab were variable, but they were within the
expected range as determined in previous studies of sunitinib14 and tremelimumab (Pfizer; unpublished results).
Serious renal events did not appear to be associated with
high tremelimumab concentrations. It was not possible to
determine from available samples if the concentration of
sunitinib was associated with renal toxicities. However,
among the patients who did not have serious renal events,
only 1 patient had a trough concentration of sunitinib
plus SU012662 >100 ng/mL, which is the lower limit of
concentrations often associated with dose-limiting toxicities,14 and this patient did not have a serious AE. Therefore, the kinetic parameters measured for sunitinib and
SU012662 in that study did not appear to be related to
the renal toxicities reported in our study.
Partial responses, some of which were durable, were
observed in 9 of 21 patients (43%) who were evaluable for
response. This response rate was within the normal range
of historic data for treatment with single-agent sunitinib
and was somewhat higher than that observed in a phase 3
trial of sunitinib alone in 750 patients with previously
untreated mRCC (31%).2 Although clinical activity was a

secondary objective and was not fully assessable in the current small phase 1 study, the objective response rate was
not increased obviously with the addition of tremelimumab in this preliminary analysis of efficacy. Several factors
may have contributed to this observation. The dose and
schedule of the 2 agents that we used in this study may not
have been optimal for clinical synergy. Because the potential immunomodulatory mechanism of sunitinib remains
to be elucidated, sunitinib in combination with immunotherapeutic agents remains a viable investigative endeavor.
Safety data suggest that the addition of tremelimumab increased the risk of grade 3 AEs. In the phase 3
study of sunitinib alone, the proportion of grade 3 or 4
AEs was 1% to 13%, and no renal toxicities were
reported2; in the current study of sunitinib plus tremelimumab, 17 of 28 patients (61%) had grade 3 or 4 AEs,
and 4 patients (14%) had renal toxicities. Although further investigation of doses >6 mg/kg tremelimumab plus
sunitinib 37.5 mg daily is not recommended, further preclinical investigation of this combination may be warranted to fully elucidate the mechanism of renal toxicity.
