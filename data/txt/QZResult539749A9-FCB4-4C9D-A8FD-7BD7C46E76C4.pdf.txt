ABSTRACT
The p53 and NFκB sequence-specific transcription factors play crucial roles
in cell proliferation and survival with critical, even if typically opposite, effects
on cancer progression. To investigate a possible crosstalk between p53 and NFκB
driven by chemotherapy-induced responses in the context of an inflammatory
microenvironment, we performed a proof of concept study using MCF7 cells.
Transcriptome analyses upon single or combined treatments with doxorubicin
(Doxo, 1.5μM) and the NFκB inducer TNF-alpha (TNFα, 5ng/ml) revealed 432 upregulated (log2 FC> 2), and 390 repressed genes (log2 FC< -2) for the Doxo+TNFα
treatment. 239 up-regulated and 161 repressed genes were synergistically regulated
by the double treatment. Annotation and pathway analyses of Doxo+TNFα selectively
up-regulated genes indicated strong enrichment for cell migration terms. A panel
of genes was examined by qPCR coupled to p53 activation by Doxo, 5-Fluoruracil
and Nutlin-3a, or to p53 or NFκB inhibition. Transcriptome data were confirmed for
12 of 15 selected genes and seven (PLK3, LAMP3, ETV7, UNC5B, NTN1, DUSP5, SNAI1)
were synergistically up-regulated after Doxo+TNFα and dependent both on p53 and
NFκB. Migration assays consistently showed an increase in motility for MCF7 cells
upon Doxo+TNFα. A signature of 29 Doxo+TNFα highly synergistic genes exhibited
prognostic value for luminal breast cancer patients, with adverse outcome correlating
with higher relative expression. We propose that the crosstalk between p53 and NFκB
can lead to the activation of specific gene expression programs that may impact on
cancer phenotypes and potentially modify the efficacy of cancer therapy.

to changes in the microenvironment requires coordinated
activation of sequence-specific transcription factors [6],
among which NFκB and p53 have a prominent role and
often opposing functions [7].
The p53 tumor suppressor gene is activated in
response to a large number of cellular stress signals,
including genotoxic stress, carbon and oxygen
deficiencies, excessive proliferation signals [8, 9].
There are >150 established p53 target genes that link
p53 to many different biological outcomes [10–14].

INTRODUCTION
Cancer cells are continuously exposed to a number
of signaling cues that reflect the distinct nature of the
microenvironment at primary tumor site, metastastic
lesions and potentially also during circulation in the blood
stream [1–4]. Therapeutic intervention strategies can
result in acute changes in microenvironment signaling,
acting also through non-transformed cellular components
resident at the primary tumor site [3, 5]. Cellular responses

The NFκB family of sequence-specific transcription factors
consists of essential regulators of immune, inflammatory,
proliferative and apoptotic responses [15], and their
activation generally results in the onset of pro-survival
signals [16]. The most common form of the NFκB complexes
is the p50/RELA (p65) heterodimer. p53 and NFκB
activation occurs simultaneously in response to diverse
stress conditions, including genotoxic stress and NFκB
proteins are frequently de-regulated in cancer, resulting in
constitutive activation [17]. Competition between p53 and
NFκB for a common limiting cofactor such as p300 can
result in mutual inhibition [17, 18]. However, examples of
positive interactions have also been reported. For example,
it was shown that p65 can induce the p53 target gene p21 by
direct binding to its promoter [19] and participates in p53dependent apoptosis [20]. Several human Toll-like receptors
(TLRs), whose signaling leads to NFκB activation [21],
were identified as direct p53 target genes both in cancer cells
and primary cells [22] and it was demonstrated that p53 and
NFκB can cooperate in the activation of pro-inflammatory
genes in primary human monocytes and macrophages [23].
To investigate more globally the transcriptional
crosstalk between p53 and NFκB we performed a proof
of concept study using breast cancer-derived MCF7
cells treated with Doxorubicin, Tumor Necrosis Factor
alpha (TNFα) and a combination of the two compounds
(Doxo+TNFα). Our results demonstrated a synergistic
interaction between p53 and NFκB transcription factors,
which can lead to the reprogramming of cell fate and
enhanced migratory potential. Seven genes (PLK3,
LAMP3, ETV7, UNC5B, NTN1, DUSP5, SNAI1)
were established as synergistically up-regulated after
Doxo+TNFα and dependent both on p53 and NFκB. A 29gene signature of highly synergistic genes up-regulated
by Doxo+TNFα appeared to have prognostic value in a
cohort of luminal breast cancer patients [24].

BAX gene [18, 20]. However, this effect was not observed
at the level of the endogenous P21 and MDM2 genes
(Figure S1B), which showed similar level of activation
in response to either Doxo alone or Doxo+TNFα. An
NFκB reporter construct was responsive to both Doxo and
TNFα as single treatments and showed a strong increase
following the double treatment that was unaffected by
p53 silencing. On the contrary, the endogenous TNFα
and MCP1 NFκB target genes were weakly responsive
to Doxo alone, highly induced by TNFα treatment,
and showed intermediate induction levels upon double
treatment. Hence, canonical p53 or NFκB target genes
did not exhibit synergistic transcriptional responses to the
combined treatment with doxorubicin and TNFα.
Next we performed a genome-wide transcriptome
analysis after Doxo, TNFα, or the combination of the
two compounds using the Agilent 4 × 44k array and
single color labeling. Differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) were selected based on rank product test,
setting a threshold of 0.05 on the percentage of false
positives (pfp) and a threshold of 2 on the absolute log2
fold changes. The double treatment more than doubled
the number of DEGs (Figure 1). The vast majority
of DEGs resulting from the single treatments were
also differentially expressed in the double treatment.
Gene Ontology (GO) as well as pathway and upstream
regulators analyses (DAVID, http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.
gov/; IPA, http://www.ingenuity.com/) confirmed
activation of p53 signaling upon Doxo treatment as
most significant pathway, and apoptosis induction
as the most significantly enriched GO terms among
up-regulated DEGs (Figure 1A-C). TNFα treatment
also resulted in gene annotation terms consistent with
NFκB activation, such as regulation of T cell activation.
The gene annotation of DEGs resulting from the double
treatment was enriched for terms typical of the two
single treatments (e.g. T cell activation and apoptosis
regulation among the up-regulated DEGs). TP53 as an
upstream regulator was less significant in the double
treatment compared to the Doxo single treatment, while
p65/RELA, NFKBIA, IRF7 and STAT1 appeared to
be even more enriched in the double treatment compared
to TNFα single treatment (Figure 1B). The double
treatment not only led to a higher number of DEGs, but
resulted in quantitative differences in gene expression
levels compared to the single treatments. We applied a
rigorous filter and identified 212 repressed, 361 induced
DEGs that were synergistically regulated by the double
treatment Doxo+TNFα (see Methods) (Figure  1D).
Notably, this subgroup of up-regulated DEGs was
enriched for cell migration GO biological process
along with the expected canonical terms for p53 and
NFκB. Collectively, our systematic analysis indicates
a vast network of genes that can be mutually affected
by combined activation of p53- and NFκB-dependent
responses.

RESULTS
Striking transcriptome changes upon the
combination of Doxorubicin and TNFα treatment
of MCF7 cells
We first investigated the potential crosstalk between
Doxorubicin (Doxo) and TNFα treatment using gene
reporter assays in the human breast adenocarcinomaderived MCF7 cells (Figure S1A). p53-dependent
responsiveness of the P21 and MDM2 promoter plasmid
constructs was observed following Doxo treatment and
confirmed by p53 silencing. The transactivation of the
P21 and MDM2 constructs was reduced upon addition
of TNFα to Doxo, suggesting possible inhibition of p53
activity by NFκB. Mutual inhibition of the p53 and p65/
RELA proteins has been previously shown on p21 [17],
while both inhibition and cooperation were reported at the

changes was evaluates using the small molecule
inhibitor BAY 11–7082 (BAY) used as single agent or in
combination with Doxo or/and TNFα (Figure 2B). Eight
of the twelve validated synergistic DEGs were tested
and for five of them BAY markedly inhibited the effect
of Doxo+TNFα, or of TNFα alone. TNFα treatment led
to higher levels of nuclear p65, while Doxo alone or in
the combined treatment did not significantly impact p65
nuclear protein levels. BAY treatment led to a slight
reduction of p65 nuclear levels, which was paralleled
by an increase in the cytoplasm (Figure 2C). p53 protein
levels were induced to similar levels by the different
treatment combinations (Figure S2).
The five genes that showed more convincing
p65 dependence on the synergistic response to
Doxo+TNFα (PLK3, NTN1, UNC5B, ETV7, LAMP3)
were investigated more deeply to establish a direct role
of wild type p53 in their transcription. MCF7 cells were
treated with the chemotherapeutic agent 5-Fluorouracil
(5FU) or with the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3a, alone or in
combination with TNFα. Both p53-inducing molecules
were at least additive with TNFα in the responsiveness
of the five genes (Figure 2D). Although the magnitude
of the synergistic response was higher with Doxo, the
fact that three different p53-activating treatments led

to up-regulation of these five genes strongly suggested
a direct role of p53. We next employed an MCF7 clone
with stable knock-down of p53 and the HCT116 p53-/cell line, to further establish p53-dependence of the five
genes expression upon Doxo treatment. Matched MCF7
vector and HCT116 p53+/+ were used as a comparison
(Figure  2E,  F). Invariably, Doxo responsiveness was
strongly reduced in the p53-defective cells. Previous
reports in the literature demonstrated or suggested p53dependent regulation of PLK3, NTN1 and UNC5B. Our
results confirm those findings and establish, for the first
time, the possibility of synergistic regulation by NFκB.
PLK3, a polo-like kinase, is an important regulator of
the cell cycle and it is involved in the control of hypoxia
signaling pathway [26]. NTN1 is ligand for both DCC1
and UNC5B receptors whose signaling can potentially
modulate p53 activity, impacting on the decision between
cell survival and cell death [27]. LAMP3 is a lysosomal
membrane associated protein important in dendritic
cells and potentially involved in tumor invasion [28],
while ETV7 is a transcription factor associated to cell
proliferation and tumorigenesis [29].
Given the lack of definitive evidence for LAMP3
and ETV7 being direct p53 targets and since our finding
of synergistic responsiveness, we examined p53 and

apparent, except for a trend with LAMP3. On the contrary
lower occupancy at MCP1 was detected in double treated
cells. This latter result is consistent with the MCP1 mRNA
expression changes (Figure S1B).
Hence, we identified genes whose expression is
co-regulated by Doxo and TNFα. The gene expression
studies conducted with different p53-activating molecules,
the use of cells lines with different p53 status, and the
chromatin immune-precipitation studies collectively
established a direct role for p53 and p65 on the
transcriptional regulation of PLK3, NTN1, ETV7, UNC5B
and LAMP3. However, we did not find a direct correlation
between occupancy levels at predicted promoter binding
sites and gene expression changes.

(Figure 3). p53 occupancy was detected both for ETV7
and LAMP3 as well as for the positive control P21, in
Doxo treated cells. For ETV7 p53 occupancy appeared
to increase also after TNFα treatment. P21 was the only
target for which p53 appeared to be bound also in the
mock condition, a result consistent with previous data
[30]. p53 occupancy levels were not distinguishable
between Doxo and Doxo+TNFα treatment.
Both LAMP3 and ETV7 exhibited p65 occupancy in
TNFα treated cells, although to a lower extent compared
to the positive control MCP1. For the three promoter
regions, occupancy was increased also by Doxo treatment
alone, but no additive effect of the double treatment was

Doxorubicin + TNFα treatment enhances the
migration potential of MCF7 cells

associated with acquisition of stem-like phenotypes in
normal or cancer cells, particularly SNAI1 [32, 33],
SOX9 [34] and GBX2 [35]. Different lines of evidence
indicate that breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) display
increased cell motility, invasion, and overexpress genes
that promote metastasis [36] and can be traced by CD44+/
CD24-/low surface marker expression [37]. We asked if
the Doxo+TNFα treatment could enhance the stem-like
subpopulation of the MCF7 cell line (Figure 4E). FACS
analysis showed that the CD44+/CD24- subpopulation
virtually disappeared after all treatments. Therefore, the
higher motility observed upon double treatment cannot be
directly related to the expression of these surface markers,
hence to putative stem-like features.

Both the gene ontology enrichments of synergistic
DEGs and the known function of the fifteen genes chosen
for validation suggested the possible activation of gene
expression programs influencing cell motility, epithelial
mesenchymal transition (EMT) or even stem-like
phenotypes. Projected to an in vivo context, the crosstalk
of signals present in an inflammatory microenvironment
could have a negative impact on the efficacy of
chemotherapy, possibly by enhancing tumor cell plasticity.
To begin exploring this hypothesis, we investigated
migration and invasion potential of MCF7 cells treated
with Doxo, TNFα or both. Three different experimental
approaches consisting in real-time cell migration analysis
(Figure 4A), transwell migration test (Figure 4B) and
wound healing assay (Figure 4D) consistently showed
higher migration potential of double-treated MCF7 cells,
while the invasion phenotype was unaffected by all three
types of treatment (Figure 4C).
Several studies suggest that EMT not only enhances
the motility and invasiveness of cancer cells, but also
provides additional aggressive features such as stemness
and therapeutic resistance [31]. Indeed, several of the 15
synergistic DEGs we validated are directly or indirectly

synergistic DEGs
Since luminal type breast cancer, of which MCF7
is considered as a model, frequently retains wild type
p53 and NFκB responsiveness, we asked if Doxo+TNFα
synergistic DEGs could be endowed with prognostic
significance. Up-regulated DEGs were further filtered
by selecting genes that were strongly responsive to the
double treatment but minimally responsive to the single
ones (see Materials and Methods). A signature list of

29 genes (DT29) was generated (Figure 5A) and used to
interrogate clinical data using the KM plotter tool [38].
Interestingly, breast cancer patients with luminal type A
diagnosis who underwent chemotherapy and exhibited
higher relative expression of DT29 genes showed poorer
prognosis (Figure 5B). The same was true for luminal A
patients with lymph node infiltration or luminal A grade 2
(Figure 5C, D).

and ETV7 was weakly Doxo+TNFα responsive. Instead in
A459 cells NTN1, ETV7 and LAMP3 were synergistically
up-regulated by Doxo+TNFα, while PLK3 and UNC5B
were additive. The magnitude of induction upon Doxo
was often one order of magnitude higher compared
to TNFα alone. Transient transfection assays with the
κB luciferase reporter construct were performed using
different concentrations of TNFα or BAY (Figure S3).
Based on the results, 10ng/ml TNFα and/or 20μM BAY
were chosen for the qPCR experiments, although the
reduction of TNFα-induced reporter activity was modest,
albeit significant. At the endogenous gene level in A549
cells we did not observe the inhibitory effect of BAY on
either TNFα-induced changes or Doxo+TNFα, with the
possible exception of UNC5B (Figure 6A-E). However,
BAY treatment reduced the Doxo responsiveness of these
genes, which might be dependent on its effect on the
activation of NFκB by endogenous production of TNFα.
In the p53 wild type A549 cells, p53 and p21 protein
levels were induced by Doxo and not affected by the
treatment with TNFα. Total p65 levels were unaffected
by all treatments in both cell lines (Figure 6F). Nuclear
p65 protein levels were increased in response to TNFα or

treated with Doxo or/and TNFα or/and BAY. Expression
of PLK3, NTN1, ETV7, UNC5B and LAMP3 was
measured by qPCR (Figure 6A-E). The impact of the
various treatments on p65 nuclear and cytoplasmic, p53
and p21 protein levels was also evaluated (Figure 6F, 6G).
In the p53 null H1299 cells the relative expression changes
of all the genes was invariably much lower compared to
A549 cells. However, NTN1 was weakly TNFα inducible

combination of the treatments. For example, SNAI1
appeared to be regulated in more than additive manner
by the double treatment, as well as LAMP3, a lysosomal
protein previously associated with metastasis risk [28,
43]. Multiple cytokines and secreted factors, including
IL6, IL17, IL15 and its receptor, S100A8 and S100A9,
CXCL12 and several Serpins were also identified as
synergistic DEGs (Table S1). The presence of S100A8,
S100A9 and CXCL12 among synergistic DEGs raises
the possibility that, unlike the case of the triple negative
cell line MDA-MB-231 for which S100A8-mediated
signaling appeared to require heterotypic cell interactions
[3] contributing to metastasis potential, in MCF7 cells
this signaling could become homotypic or even autocrine.
A marked difference in secreted factors and associated
signaling among MDA and MCF7 cells was elegantly
shown in recent studies [4].
A direct contribution of p65/RELA and p53
in the observed gene expression changes elicited by
Doxorubicin and TNFα was inferred for some of the
synergistic DEGs by modulating pharmacologically or
genetically p65 or p53 activities. However, we cannot
exclude at this stage a (Doxo+TNFα)-dependent, but
p53- or NFκB- independent gene expression changes.
For example, NFkB can functionally interact with
AP-1 [44–46] or ER [47], which in turn can modulate
p53-dependent responses [48] [49] [50].
Among the most synergistic genes, 29 appear to
be prognostic in luminal A breast cancer patients who
underwent chemotherapy, where their higher expression
correlated with adverse outcome. The majority of luminal
A breast cancers are wild type for p53 [51], although data
is not available to stratify patients for p53 status in the
KM plotter tool [24]. Based on available ChIP-seq data
[14, 25, 52, 53], 20 of these 29 genes are putative targets
of either p53 or p65 and 10 of them are putative targets of
both factors (Figure 5). This result raises the possibility
of an unexpected negative outcome of chemotherapy in
the context of an inflammatory microenvironment. The
prognostic significance of this gene signature needs
in-depth evaluation in independent patients cohorts. If
confirmed, the results would further support the value
of combining treatments activating p53 and repressing
NFκB [7].
Given that the crosstalk between Doxorubicin
and TNFα and the interplay between p53 and NFκB
would occur in cells residing or infiltrating the tumor
microenvironment, the ultimate in vivo outcome of these
functional interactions may vary and cannot be directly
predicted from our study using a pure culture of MCF7
cells in vitro. Here we have explored Doxo+TNFα
impact on HUVEC cells and also on a p53 wild type lung
adenocarcinoma-derived cancer cell line. Although limited
by the number of genes tested, the results suggest that a
positive crosstalk between Doxorubicin and TNFα can
be a general characteristic of different cell types and is

Doxo+TNFα in both A549 and H1299 cells (Figure 6G).
Interestingly, BAY treatment alone or in combination led
to a reduction in p65 nuclear accumulation (Figure 6G).
HUVEC primary cells were also subjected to Doxo
and TNFα single or double treatment and the expression
of the same panel of five genes was tested by qPCR
(Figure S4). Results among biological repeats varied, but
in the majority of tests, all genes with the exception of
LAMP3 were Doxo responsive; NTN1 and ETV7 were
also TNFα responsive. No synergistic up-regulation by the
double treatment could be consistently established. p53
and p65 protein levels confirmed i) the activation of p53,
with a similar level of p53 protein in the double treatment,
and ii) the p65 proficiency of this cell line.

DISCUSSION
Wild type p53 functions are intricately related to
multiple tumor suppressor pathways, primarily acting
in cell autonomous manner to restrain cell proliferation
and including cell death and senescence in response
to genotoxic and many other types of cellular stresses
[8, 9]. Furthermore, p53 also contributes to modulate
the microenvironment in a non-cell autonomous
manner [39]. p53 has also been linked to inhibition of
EMT, for example through an indirect stimulation of
E-cadherin expression [40]. At the same time, paracrine
signaling in mice triggered by Doxorubicin were found
to stimulate EMT and metastatic potential of cancer
cells, in part through NFκB activation [3]. Many studies
have highlighted the potential contribution of NFκBinduced signaling in the acquisition of cancer cell traits
conducive to chemoresistance and higher metastasis
risk [2] [41]. While, the canonical functions of p53 and
NFκB are consistent with the co-occurrence of p53
inactivation and NFκB hyper-activation that is frequent in
cancer [7], recent studies provided examples of positive
cooperation between p53 and NFκB that would occur
in specific cell types, such as antigen presenting cells or
macrophages, and contribute to physiological responses,
such as for example in the process of innate immunity and
inflammation [12, 22, 23, 42].
Here we modeled the impact of a first line
chemotherapeutic drug leading to genotoxic stress and
p53 activation, using exposure to the immune cytokine and
NFκB activator molecule TNFα as a variable, mimicking
the effect of an inflammatory microenvironment. We
used transcriptome analysis as primary endpoint and
uncovered a vast network of differentially expressed
genes that selectively responds to combined treatment
with Doxorubicin and TNFα. Furthermore, genes that
were synergistically up-regulated by both treatments
appeared to endow cells with higher motility potential
in vitro. Analyses of the annotated gene functions related
to the aforementioned genes also revealed the possibility
of an induced epithelial mesenchymal transition upon

at least in part p53-dependent, based on the results with a
p53 null lung cancer cell line. Furthermore, while we have
addressed here the functional interactions between two
small molecules, cells are constantly exposed to a complex
milieu of signaling factors. However, both p53 and NFκB
are master regulators, often contributing a dominant trait
in gene expression changes to their target genes. Nuclear
receptors, including Estrogen Receptors (ERs) can also
modulate NFκB as well as p53 functions [54–56] and
have critical roles in breast cancer etiology. We also
explored the impact of ER function in the transcriptional
programs responding to Doxorubicin and TNFα exposure,
using estrogen-depleted culture conditions and adding
17β-estradiol (10-9M, E2) as variable (Table S2 and GSE
24065). However, the combination of E2 to Doxo and
TNFα resulted only in 15 and 11 selective up- and downregulated DEGs, respectively (Table S3). A hierarchical
cluster analysis of all the treatments confirmed graphically
the large difference between TNFα- and Doxo-induced
transcriptomes and also the significant impact of TNFα
when combined to Doxo, while E2 had a minor effect both
in the combination with Doxo and with Doxo + TNFα
(Figure S5).
With this study we established an example of
positive cooperation between p53 and NFκB, in the
context of the responses of an epithelial cancer cell to
standard chemotherapy but in the presence of active
signaling by a pleiotropic inflammatory cytokine, such as
TNFα. A signature gene of the consequent transcriptional
reprogramming appears to be prognostic in breast cancer
patients. Associated gene functions indicate the potential
acquisition of enhanced cell plasticity and motility and
provide a rationale to investigating mechanisms resulting
in acquired chemoresistance, particularly for luminal A
breast cancer, but potentially with general implication
for p53 wild type tumors of different tissue types, and
for overcoming such resistance by targeting NFκB. The
unexpected positive crosstalk between p53 and NFκB
emerging from our and other very recent studies [23]
may represent an evolutionary consequence of antiviral and infection responses towards which NFκB is
an established master regulator [57], but the p53 and
p73 family member are emerging as important/critical
contributors [42, 58, 59].

MCF7-shp53 or control MCF7-vector cells were provided
by Dr. Agami (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam,
The Netherlands). Cells were cultured in DMEM or
RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS, or Medium
199 (Lonza Milan, Italy) supplemented with 50 units/
ml Low Serum Growth Supplements (Life Technologies,
Milan, Italy) in the case of HUVEC cells that were also
cultured on 0.1% gelatin pre-coated plastics. Media were
supplemented by 2mM L-Glutamine and 1XPenicillin/
Streptomycin mixture (Pen/Strep), and Puromycin (0.5 μg/
mL) in the case of MCF7-shp53 and –vector cells. When
appropriate, cells were maintained in DMEM without
Phenol Red (Lonza) supplemented with Charcoal/Dextran
treated FBS (Hyclone, GE Healthcare, South Logan,
UT, USA).

Drug treatments
Doxorubicin (Doxo, 1.5 μM), 5-Fluorouracil (5FU,
375 μM), Nutlin-3a (10 μM) were used to stabilize p53
protein. When needed TNFα (5ng/ml in MCF7 and 10ng/
ml in H1299, A549 and HUVEC cells –based on doseresponse tests with gene reporter assays) or BAY11-7082
(10μM or 20μM in H1299 and A549) were added to the
culture medium. All compounds were from Sigma-Aldrich
(Milan, Italy).

Microarray experiment and data analysis
Total RNA was extracted from 4 biological
replicates using the Agilent Total RNA Isolation Mini Kit
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Samples
with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) above 9 (Agilent 2100
BioAnalyzer) were processed. Details are provided with
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo) submission (GSE24065) and in [56]. The
output of Feature Extraction (Agilent standard protocol
GE1_107_Sep09) was analyzed with the R software for
statistical computing and the Bioconductor library of
biostatistical packages. Probes with low signals were
removed in order to filter out the unexpressed genes
and keep only probes with acceptable signals in most
of the replicates. Signal intensities across arrays were
normalized by quantile normalization. Signal intensities
from probes associated with the same gene were averaged.
This procedure resulted in quantitative signals for 14095
HGNC genes. To identify potential target genes of
Doxorubicin and TNFα, we compared the signals after
the double treatment (Doxo+TNFα) and the two single
treatments relative to the untreated control (mock).
DEGs were selected applying a statistical test based on
rank products implemented in RankProd Bioconductor
package, setting a threshold of 0.05 on the percentage of
false positives (pfp) and a threshold of 2 on the absolute
log2 fold changes [60]. Every treatment was compared to
the mock condition (Table S1, S2 and Figure S5).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions
MCF7 (p53 wild type, expressing p65 and positive
for ERs) and HUVEC (Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial
Cells) cells were obtained from ICLC (Genoa, Italy), while
A549 from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). H1299 cells were
a gift of Dr. Resnick’s laboratory (NIEHS, NIH, RTP, NC,
USA); HCT116 p53+/+ and p53-/- of Dr. Vogelstein’s (John
Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA).

To select genes with synergistic effect, i.e. genes
whose expression variations were more than additive in
the double treatment with respect to single treatments, a
further comparison between the double treatment samples
and all the remaining samples (single treatments and
control samples) was performed (double treatment vs all).
Synergistic DEGs were selected applying an additional
pfp filter (pfp<0.005) derived from this comparison, to
the list of DEGs resulting from the “double treatment
vs mock” comparison. A more stringent criterion was
obtained by calculating the synergistic effect (SE) of
the double treatment as the observed difference between
the fold change of the double treatment and the sum of the
fold changes of the single treatments (SE=log2 FC double
treatment – (log2 FC Doxorubicin + log2 FC TNFα).
We filtered genes with SE>0 for up-regulated DEGs,
SE<0 for down-regulated genes (Figure 1). To select
genes where the up-regulation contribution of each single
treatment was low respect to the up-regulation of the
double treatment, the ratio of the single/double treatments
was calculated, applying a 0.25 filter on them (FC
Doxorubicin/FC double treatment <0.25 and FC TNFα/
FC double treatment <0.25) (see Table S1, S2).

Italy) and anti-Lamin A/C (clone #: 2032, Cell Signaling,
Milan, Italy) used as nuclear loading control, and antiGAPDH used as cytoplasmic loading control.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
We used previously described protocols [63, 64].
The following antibodies were used: anti-p53 (DO-1),
anti-p65 (C-20) and IgG (sc-2025 or sc-2027) (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). ChIP-qPCR experiments were performed
using Sybr MasterMix (Kapa Biosystems) and 2 μl of
enriched DNA. Results were analyzed by the comparative
Ct method (ΔCt) and normalized as % of input. Regions
in the promoter of GAPDH or ACTB and p21 or
MCP1 genes served as negative and positive controls,
respectively. Primers were selected using Primer 3
(http://primer3.ut.ee/).

Migration and wound healing assays
The migration potential of MCF7 cells was
monitored by a real-time technique using the
xCELLigence Instrument (Acea Biosciences, Euroclone)
and CIM-16 plates, following manufacturer’s instructions.
Prior to the analysis, cells were grown in estrogen-free
medium for two days and left untreated (mock) or treated
with Doxo, TNFα or the combination. 16 hours after
the treatments, cells were detached and added to the top
chamber in serum-free medium. Migration was detected
every 10 minutes for 24 hours. We used 0.5% and 5%
FBS as chemo-attractant. Migration and Invasion were
also measured by QCMTM Fluor 24-Well Cell Migration
and Cell Invasion kits (Merck-Millipore, Milan, Italy),
according to manufacturer’s instructions. For wound
healing, cells were seeded in 12-well plates and treated
with Doxo, TNFα or the combination. After 16 hours a
scratch was introduced using a 10 μl pipette tip. Images of
the same field were acquired immediately (T0) and after
24 hours (T24) using an automated Zeiss microscope and
the AxioVision3.1 software in multidimensional mode
with mosaic (3x3) acquisition.

RNA isolation and quantitative qPCR
Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Kit
(Qiagen). cDNA was converted from 1 µg of RNA using
M-MuLV reverse transcritptase and RevertAid cDNA
Synthesis kit (ThermoFisher, Milan, Italy). qPCR was
performed on a Bio-Rad CFX384 (Bio-Rad, Milan, Italy).
TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Life
Technologies) and Probe MasterMix (Kapa Biosystems,
Resnova, Rome, Italy) were used starting with 25ng of
cDNA as previously described [56, 61]. GAPDH, B2M or
ACTB served as reference genes.

Western blot
Protein extraction and immunodetections were
performed as previously described [62], using ECL Select
detection reagent (GE Healthcare) and anti-p53 (DO-1)
anti-RelA/p65 (C-20) anti- p21 (C19), anti-GAPDH (6C5)
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany). When
appropriate, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation was
performed. MCF7, A549 and H1299 cell lines were seeded
on 100mm Petri dishes and treated at 80% confluence
with Doxo, TNFα, BAY or the combination of the drugs
for 16 hours. Cells were harvested and cytoplasmic and
nuclear proteins were extracted using NE-PER Nuclear
and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit (Pierce, ThermoFisher
Scientific), following the instructions provided by the
manufacturer. 20 μg of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts
were loaded on a 12% poly-acrylamide gel and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes. Antibodies used for detection
were: anti-Histone H3 (clone #: ab1791, AbCam, Milan,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Flow cytometry
MCF7 cells, seeded and treated as described
above, were washed with PBS and harvested by 0.05%
trypsin/0.025% EDTA. The cells were washed again
with PBS containing 2% FBS before being subjected
to antibody binding, a combination of fluorochromeconjugated monoclonal antibodies against human CD44
(APC) and CD24 (FITC) or their respective isotype
controls (BD Biosciences, Milan, Italy) and incubated on
ice in the dark for 30 minutes. Cells were then washed
twice with PBS/2% FBS and resuspended in PBS. Flow
cytometry analysis was conducted using a FACSCanto II
instrument (BD Biosciences).
