Abstract
In this issue of Cancer Cell, Mohammad et al. describe LSD1, a histone demethylase, as a
therapeutic target in SCLC with a unique epigenetic signature to predict drug sensitivity. Inhibition
of LSD1 reduces cell proliferation and stem cell maintenance while promoting cell differentiation
and reducing tumor growth in preclinical models.

Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is one of the most genetically complex cancers (Peifer et
al., 2012). Beyond mutations, epigenetic changes also play a key role in promoting
aggressive behavior of SCLC. 31,000 patients are diagnosed with SCLC annually in the
United States, a majority of whom have widely disseminated disease at presentation and will
succumb to their cancer within a year despite current treatments. Unlike non-small cell lung
carcinoma (NSCLC), where a growing number of druggable genetic alterations have
transformed treatment (e.g., EGFR mutations and ALK, RET, and ROS1 fusions), in SCLC
there are currently no targeted therapies with established efficacy and there are no validated
biomarkers to guide treatment selection. As a result, a decades-old regimen of platinumetoposide chemotherapy remains the standard of care.
A major challenge in treating SCLC is the rapid emergence of drug resistance, which
typically occurs within months of completing chemotherapy. Average survival after
recurrence is only 4–6 months due toa lack of effective second-line treatment options.
Previous studies in a variety of cancer types have demonstrated the ability of epigenetic
therapy to modulate the expression of genes regulating chemoresistance and other critical
oncogenic behaviors (Azad et al., 2013).

Recently, by comparing methylation patterns in SCLC tumors versus normal lung, Poirier et
al. (2015) demonstrated that methylation regulates key SCLC genes, including
overexpression of BCL2 and silencing of RB1. Using human tumors, patient-derived
xenografts (PDXs), and cell lines, they then identified distinct, reproducible methylation
subgroups within SCLC that likely represent subsets with distinct therapeutic responses.
Some of these epigenetic changes may be regulated by recurring mutations that include
several chromatin modifiers and epigenetic readers (Peifer et al., 2012; Rudin et al., 2012).

Clinically, FDA-approved indications for epigenetic therapies are limited to hematological
malignancies. However, epigenetic machinery has emerged as an important target for
additional diseases including lung cancer. In SCLC, preclinical activity of the histone
deacetylase inhibitors vorinostat and belinostat in combination with cisplatin/etoposide
(standard first-line treatment) or topotecan (the only FDA approved second-line therapy for
SCLC) has led to clinical trials investigating these drugs in combination with chemotherapy.

In this issue of Cancer Cell, Mohammad et al. (2015) describe the discovery and
characterization of GSK2879552, a selective, highly potent small molecule inhibitor of
lysine demethylase 1 (LSD1). LSD1 is a histone modifier that maintains the pleuripotency of
embryonic stem cells through demethylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and subsequent
repression of genes controlling cell differentiation (Adamo et al., 2011). Prior studies have
shown that LSD1 is overexpressed in many cancer types and that inhibition promotes
differentiation and reduces cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion (Lv et al., 2012).
Because of its central role in stem cell maintenance and cancer progression, the authors
sought to identify potent inhibitors of LDS1. This led ultimately to the identification of three
LSD1 inhibitory molecules, including GSK2879552 and GSK-LSD1. Further
characterization demonstrated that GSK2879552 completely and irreversibly inactivates
LSD1’s enzymatic activity and is highly specific for LSD1, despite LSD1 having a structure
closely related to LSD2, MAO-A, and MAO-B.

The authors then treated 165 cell lines representing multiple cancer types with the newly
discovered inhibitors. Most were insensitive to GSK2879552; however, a significant subset
of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and SCLC cell lines were sensitive. The sensitivity of
AML to LSD1 inhibition was not surprising based on previously published reports (Harris et
al., 2012) and the established use of epigenetic therapies for AML. In contrast, activity in
SCLC cell lines (~30% of those tested) was a novel and unexpected observation—and one
with the potential to address a significant unmet need. As such, the authors performed a
detailed investigation into the effects of GSK2879552 in SCLC models.
Consistent with the pro-differentiation effect of LSD1 inhibition, GSK2879552 was
primarily cytostatic, rather than cytotoxic, in SCLC preclinical models, resulting in a
delayed onset of growth inhibition in vitro. Similarly, in SCLC xenografts, tumors did not
significantly regress, but rather growth was pronouncedly delayed in treated animals versus
controls.

Author Manuscript

Confident in the therapeutic activity of GSK2879552 in SCLC models, the investigators then
demonstrated that LSD1 protein is highly expressed in patient tumors and that expression of
genes involved in neuroendocrine differentiation (a hallmark of SCLC) changed following
GSK2879552 treatment. Next, an integrated analysis of epigenetic changes caused by LSD1
inhibition found LSD1 and H3K4 methylation enrichment surrounding transcriptional start
sites of genes involved in the regulation of cell state. These findings implicate a role for
LSD1 in maintaining SCLC stemness, with LSD1 inhibition promoting differentiation,
similar to what has been observed in other cancer types.

Because only a subset of SCLC models demonstrate sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition, the
authors were interested in biomarkers that could potentially identify those SCLC patients
likely to derive the greatest benefit from LSD1 targeted therapy. They failed to identify
mRNA biomarkers but did identify a set of 45 methylation probes with differences between
sensitive and resistant preclinical models. Critically, these 45 probes also separated SCLC
human tumors and/or PDX models into two groups—supporting their potential to stratify
patients based on the likelihood of response. Most intriguingly, the authors then
demonstrated the ability of their methylation signature “score” to correctly predict the
response of three PDX models to treatment with GSK2879552 (Figure 1A).

Taken together, the findings in this study support GSK2879552 as an LSD1 inhibitor with
potential activity against SCLC. Today, patients with SCLC continue to be treated with a
“one-size-fits-all” approach using chemotherapy regimens that have not significantly
changed in 30 years. However, a growing understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of
this disease should allow us to exploit unique molecular features of an individual’s cancer to
target specific therapeutic vulnerabilities. The preclinical findings described in this issue are
of particular translational relevance given a current multicenter phase 1 study of
GSK2879552 in patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC (NCT02034123).

Author Manuscript

Given the critical issue of drug resistance in SCLC and the potential contribution of stemcell enrichment to this clinical problem, the introduction of a novel drug that promotes
differentiation may be especially effective in treating or preventing SCLC relapse. SCLC
cell lines contain large populations of stem cells (Sullivan et al., 2010), which are implicated
in chemotherapy resistance and metastasis, both of which are major challenges in SCLC. In
fact, CD133 levels, a marker of stem cells, were elevated in SCLC tumors following
chemotherapy (Sarvi et al., 2014). By promoting differentiation, rather than stem cell
maintenance, LSD1 inhibition may prolong sensitivity to chemotherapy.

Author Manuscript

The work presented here represents an exciting step toward the possibility of personalized
cancer therapy in SCLC. Nevertheless, important questions remain. First, further
investigation into the mechanism of action of GSK2879552 in SCLC is warranted given that
methylation markers—but not mRNA levels (which should change in response to alterations
in methylation)—were predictive of drug response. This raises the possibility of additional
mechanisms by which the LSD1 inhibitor may be acting, such as decreasing the stability of
E2F1 protein (Kontaki and Talianidis, 2010). SCLC is an E2F1 “addicted” tumor due to the
loss of RB1, and this may contribute to its sensitivity to LSD1 inhibition. Second, the
ongoing clinical trial will begin to address whether GSK2879552 has single agent activity in
patients with relapse. However, this drug may be most effective in the maintenance setting
after the bulky disease has been reduced by chemotherapy and a cancer stem cell population
may be enriched and poised for disease recurrence (Figure 1B). In conclusion, this is a
promising novel therapeutic agent with unexpected activity in SCLC. In addition to
introducing potentially active epigenetic therapy, this study provides the first epigenetic
biomarker for SCLC and represents a step toward more tailored treatment for SCLC
patients.

Author Manuscript

(A) A signature of 45 differentially methylated CpGs was associated with in vitro sensitivity
to the LSD1 inhibitor GSK2879552. To test the performance of the methylation signature,
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were scored to predict drug response. Two PDXs with
positive methylation signature scores responded to GSK2879552, whereas a PDX with a
negative score was resistant.
(B) Clinical schema of proposed mechanism of GSK2879552 in a biomarker selected SCLC
patient population. Following an initial treatment period with chemotherapy, treatment of
stem-cell enriched residual SCLC tumor leads to further regression and disease control.
