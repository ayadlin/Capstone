Abstract
Rapamycin (or sirolimus), the prototypical inhibitor of the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and an immunosuppressant used for the prevention of renal transplant rejection,
has recently emerged as an effective treatment for Kaposi’s
sarcoma (KS), an enigmatic vascular tumor and a model for
pathologic angiogenesis. Indeed, recent work supports a role
for mTOR as a central player in the transformation of
endothelial cells by the KS-associated herpesvirus–encoded
G protein–coupled receptor (vGPCR), the viral oncogene
believed to be responsible for causing KS. However, emerging
evidence that rapamycin may transiently promote the activation of Akt may limit its use as an anti-KS therapy. Here, we
show that activation of Akt in endothelial cells expressing
vGPCR is augmented by treatment with rapamycin, resulting
in the up-regulation of several Akt proliferative and survival
pathways. However, use of a novel dual phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase A (PI3KA)/mTOR inhibitor, PI-103, effectively and
independently blocked activation of both PI3K and mTOR in
vGPCR-expressing endothelial cells. This resulted in more
effective inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and
survival in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Our results suggest
that PI-103 may be an effective therapeutic option for the
treatment of patients with KS. Moreover, as KS may serve as a
model for pathologic angiogenesis, our results further provide
the basis for the early assessment of PI-103 as an antiangiogenic chemotherapeutic. [Cancer Res 2008;68(20):8361–8]

Introduction
Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) is a multifocal vascular neoplasm that
affects immunosuppressed individuals (1, 2). Indeed, as the most
common acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related
malignancy worldwide and the most frequent cancer among
children and adult men in sub-Saharan Africa, KS has emerged
as a major cause of morbidity and mortality among the AIDS
population. Despite decades of investigation into the etiology of
this enigmatic tumor, clinical management of KS has proven to be
challenging.
Invariably associated with infection by the KS-associated
herpesvirus (KSHV or HHV8), current research efforts have focused
on the study of the relative contribution of KSHV-encoded genes
to Kaposi’s sarcomagenesis to identify novel mechanism-based

therapies for patients suffering from this neoplasm. Although
several viral genes bear potential for KS pathogenesis, compelling
data point to the KSHV-encoded G protein–coupled receptor
(vGPCR) as a leading candidate viral gene for the initiation of KS
(3, 4). Expression of KSHV vGPCR in mice by endothelial cell–
specific retroviral transduction (5) or in traditional transgenic
models (6, 7) has revealed the remarkable sarcomagenic potential
of this viral receptor.
Of interest, emerging evidence has implicated the Akt downstream effectors tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)/mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a key intracellular route regulating
endothelial cell biological responses, including endothelial tumor
formation and pathologic angiogenesis (8–11). Indeed, we have
recently shown that KSHV vGPCR activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a fundamental
role in KS development and that rapamycin (sirolimus) is able to
block vGPCR oncogenesis in vitro and in vivo (12). Of interest, this
drug is an efficient therapy for transplant recipients with
(iatrogenic) KS (13, 14) as well as for patients with the classic
form of the disease (15, 16). However, treatment with rapamycin
has not been successful in all KS patients (17–20). Why this
treatment is successful in some patients, but not in others, remains
unclear; the recent observation that rapamycin causes transient
up-regulation of Akt and Akt-mediated survival in some normal
and tumor cells may provide one explanation (21–23). Indeed, as
Akt activation is a recurring theme in oncogenesis, this transient
up-regulation of Akt may expose a potential Achilles’ heel of
rapamycin as a chemotherapeutic agent (24, 25).
Of note, a novel chemotherapeutic drug, PI-103, has recently
been shown to independently inhibit both PI3Ka and mTOR (26),
thereby overcoming a potential disadvantage of rapamycin in the
treatment of Akt-dependent tumors. We therefore set out to assess
the efficacy of PI-103 for the treatment of KS. Our results show that
PI-103 blocks endothelial cell proliferation and survival more efficiently than rapamycin and demonstrate the potential of inhibiting
both PI3Ka and mTOR as an effective antiangiogenic approach.

Materials and Methods
Expression plasmids and reagents. The expression plasmids for KSHV
vGPCR, vGPCR R143A, Rheb, and enhanced green fluorescent protein have
been described elsewhere (11, 12). LY294002 and rapamycin were purchased
from Calbiochem. The dual PI3Ka/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 has been
previously described (26). For in vitro studies, rapamycin, LY294002, and
PI-103 were reconstituted in DMSO as 1000 stock solutions and were
further diluted to the working concentration in culture medium. For in vivo
studies, rapamycin (LC Laboratories) was dissolved in 100% ethanol as
20 mg/mL stock solutions and further diluted in an aqueous solution of
5.2% Tween 80 and 5.2% polyethylene glycol immediately before use (27).
PI-103 was dissolved in 100% DMSO (5 mg/mL) and subsequently diluted to
50% DMSO in water before use.

Cancer Research
Cell lines and transfections and cell proliferation assays. Immortalized murine endothelial cells (SVEC), EC-vGPCR, EC-R143A, and COS-7
cells were cultured as previously described (5). Transfection of COS-7 was
performed using PolyFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Cell proliferation was determined using the crystal violet staining
assay (28).
5-Bromo-2¶-deoxyuridine uptake and flow cytometry. 5-Bromo-2¶deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) uptake was determined using the BrdUrd Kit I
from Roche Applied Sciences. Briefly, cells were plated on coverslips and
serum starved for 24 h. BrdUrd (10 mmol/L) was added and cells were
then treated with LY294002, rapamycin, or PI-103 for 6 h. Cells were
fixed with ethanol fixative (50 mmol/L glycine solution into ethanol)
and incubated with anti-BrdUrd working solution and anti-mouse Igfluorescein working solution. Cells were finally covered with Vectashield
mounting medium containing propidium iodide (Vector Laboratories,
Inc.). The samples were analyzed under a fluorescence microscope with a
detection range of 515 to 565 nm. For apoptosis detection, 0.5  106 cells
were seeded, serum starved for 24 h, and treated as indicated with
LY294002, rapamycin, or PI-103. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry
using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection kit (BD Biosciences) and
propidium iodide staining.
Establishment and treatment of tumor allografts in athymic nu/nu
mice. SVEC, EC-vGPCR, or EC-R143A (106) cells were used to induce
allografts in 8-wk-old athymic (nu/nu) nude female mice as described (11).
Briefly, early-passage, exponentially growing cells were harvested after
stable selection with G418, washed with PBS, and resuspended in DMEM.
Viable cells (106) were then transplanted s.c. in the right flank of the mouse.
The animals were monitored thrice weekly for tumor formation. The
longest length (L) and shortest width (W) of the tumor were measured
using a caliper at different time points throughout the experiment. Tumor
volume was then converted into tumor weight using the formula LW 2/2, as
described previously (29). PI-103 treatment was commenced when
estimated tumor weight reached f0.25 g. For this procedure, tumor-

bearing animals were randomly grouped (control, n = 5; PI-103–treated
group, n = 5) and treated with PI-103 (10 mg/kg/d) or an equal volume of
vehicle. Treatment schedule was a single injection per animal given i.p. for
18 consecutive days (26). Results of animal experiments were expressed as
mean estimated tumor weight F SD. When appropriate, animals were
euthanized, and tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in
paraffin or lysed for further analysis. For BrdUrd studies, mice were first
given an i.p. injection of BrdUrd (100 mg/kg) 2 h before sacrifice. Detection
of apoptotic cells was performed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
(TdT)–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay using TdT end
labeling with DIG. All procedures involving animals were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Western blots and immunohistochemistry. Western blots and
immunohistochemical analysis were performed as previously described
(5, 11). Antibodies recognizing phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt), Akt, phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (P-S6), S6 ribosomal protein, phosphorylated
p38 (P-p38), p38, phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 (P-GSK3),
GSK3, phosphorylated BAD (P-BAD), BAD, phosphorylated Mdm2
(P-Mdm2), p27, phosphorylated p70 S6K (P-S6K), and p70 S6K were
obtained from Cell Signaling. Antibodies recognizing phosphorylated p27
(P-p27) and Mdm2 were obtained from R&D Systems and BD Biosciences,
respectively.

Results
Rapamycin inhibits mTOR but up-regulates Akt signaling in
vGPCR-expressing endothelial cells. KSHV, the human herpesvirus that causes KS, encodes a G protein–coupled receptor
(vGPCR) that has been shown to reproduce KS-like tumors when
expressed in transgenic mice (5–7). vGPCR is a homologue of the
human chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 that exhibits
constitutive signaling to several oncogenic pathways (4, 30, 31).

Inhibition of PI3Ka/mTOR as a Treatment for KS

by LY294002 but not by PI-103 (or
rapamycin). C, immunodetection of the

(Control ) for 6 h.

Immortalized murine vascular endothelial cells (SVECs) expressing
vGPCR (EC-vGPCR) are highly tumorigenic in nude mice (Fig. 1A,
top). A single point mutation in the highly conserved DRY sequence
abrogates vGPCR constitutive activity (32); in turn, murine
endothelial cells stably expressing this inactive vGPCR R143A
mutant (EC-R143A) are not tumorigenic. Of interest, the oncogenic
potential of vGPCR seems to correlate with its ability to signal to
Akt and its effector kinase, mTOR (Fig. 1A, bottom). These results
suggest that constitutive signaling to Akt and mTOR may play a
fundamental role in vGPCR oncogenesis.
Of note, several studies have shown the efficacy of the mTOR
inhibitor, rapamycin (sirolimus), in the treatment of transplant
recipients with (iatrogenic) KS (13, 14) as well as patients with
classic KS (15, 16). However, recent reports documenting the
therapeutic failure of rapamycin for some KS patients suggest that
the relationship among vGPCR, mTOR, and rapamycin in KSHVinfected endothelial cells may be more complicated than previously
thought (17–20). Indeed, emerging evidence points to a complex
regulation of Akt/TSC/mTOR activity (24, 25). An intriguing recent
finding is that Akt is up-regulated in some cells treated with
rapamycin as a result of the loss of mTOR-mediated inhibitory
feedback mechanisms (21–23, 25). We therefore set out to
determine whether Akt was up-regulated in vGPCR-expressing
endothelial cells on treatment with rapamycin. As shown in Fig. 1B,
treatment of EC-vGPCR cells with increasing doses of rapamycin
for 6 h resulted in an inhibition of mTOR; however, the levels of
phosphorylated Akt increased in a dose-dependent manner.
Conversely, EC-vGPCR cells exposed to increasing doses of the

www.aacrjournals.org

PI3K inhibitor LY294002 showed inhibition of both Akt and mTOR
under the same experimental conditions.
We then investigated whether the increase in the phosphorylation of Akt observed in EC-vGPCR cells treated with rapamycin was
associated with an increased phosphorylation of endogenous Akt
substrates. We found that treatment of vGPCR-expressing endothelial cells with rapamycin resulted in a marked increase in the
phosphorylation of GSK3 and BAD (Fig. 1C). Phosphorylation of
other Akt downstream effectors was unaffected (MDM2 and p27)
or down-regulated (p70 S6K and S6 ribosomal protein). Collectively,
these results suggest that, while inhibiting vGPCR-induced mTOR
activity, rapamycin treatment may simultaneously lead to functional activation of Akt signaling in vGPCR-expressing endothelial
cells.
Treatment of vGPCR-expressing endothelial cells with PI103 inhibits activation of both Akt and mTOR independently.
These findings suggest that inhibiting Akt activation in rapamycintreated KS tumors may improve the efficacy of rapamycin
treatment for vGPCR-induced tumorigenesis. In this regard, a
novel dual PI3Ka/mTOR inhibitor, PI-103, has shown to be highly
effective in the inhibition of both Akt and mTOR activity in vitro
and in vivo (26). We therefore set out to determine whether PI-103
could provide an alternative therapeutic option for the treatment
of KS. We treated EC-vGPCR cells with increasing concentrations
of PI-103 and found that this drug potently inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt as well as the phosphorylation of the mTOR
substrate, p70 S6K, and its downstream effector, S6 ribosomal
protein (Fig. 2A).

Cancer Research

To further explore the independent sensitivities of Akt and
mTOR activation to treatment with PI-103, we coexpressed vGPCR
with wild-type Rheb—the Ras-related small GTP-binding protein
that promotes the activation of mTOR. Rheb is unique among
members of the small GTPase family in that the regulation of its
function occurs predominately through its inactivation by Rheb
GTPase-activating proteins (e.g., TSC2) rather than its activation by
Rheb guanidine exchange factors (33); thus, overexpression of Rheb
bypasses the requirement for PI3K activation of Akt to promote
mTOR activity. Indeed, coexpression of Rheb was able to partially
rescue the inhibition of mTOR by LY294002, but not by PI-103
(or rapamycin), confirming that PI-103 blocks S6 phosphorylation
in these cells by direct inhibition of mTOR (Fig. 2B).
We next explored the effect of treating vGPCR-expressing
endothelial cells with PI-103 on the phosphorylation of Akt
substrates. Figure 2C shows that, unlike rapamycin, PI-103 potently
inhibited the activation of GSK3, BAD, Mdm2, and p27. Collectively,
these results show that PI-103, unlike LY294002 or rapamycin,
is capable of inhibiting vGPCR activation of both PI3K/Akt and
mTOR independently.

Simultaneous inhibition of mTOR and PI3K by PI-103 more
effectively inhibits endothelial cell proliferation. We next set
out to determine whether inhibition of both PI3K and mTOR would
be more effective than treatment with rapamycin in preventing
the proliferation of endothelial cells expressing vGPCR. To this end,
we treated EC-vGPCR cells with increasing doses of PI-103,
rapamycin, or LY294002. Figure 3A shows that treatment of cells
with PI-103 was able to more efficiently block cell proliferation
than rapamycin or LY294002 alone. The sensitivity to PI-103, as
assessed by IC50, was f0.2 Amol/L, achieving IC80 values with
f8 Amol/L of compound. Furthermore, when we checked the
incorporation of BrdUrd by vGPCR-expressing endothelial cells
treated with the different drugs, BrdUrd uptake was more
significantly reduced in PI-103–treated EC-vGPCR cells (81%) than
in rapamycin-treated EC-vGPCR cells (50%; P < 0.01; Fig. 3B and C).
Of note, this remarkable sensitivity of the proliferative potential of
EC-vGPCR was significantly higher than that of the parental SVEC
endothelial cell line (Fig. 3C), emphasizing the importance of the
Akt/mTOR pathway for the proliferation of vGPCR-expressing cells.
Collectively, these results suggest that, compared with rapamycin,

Figure 3. PI-103 inhibits proliferation of KSHV vGPCR-expressing cells more effectively than rapamycin. A, effect of the treatment with increasing doses of LY294002,

Inhibition of PI3Ka/mTOR as a Treatment for KS

Figure 4. PI-103 induces apoptosis of KSHV vGPCR-expressing cells more effectively than rapamycin. A, effect of the treatment with 10 Amol/L LY294002, 10 nmol/L
rapamycin, 10 Amol/L PI-103, or DMSO (Control ) on EC-vGPCR apoptosis. Cells were cultured for 6 h (A ) or 24 h (B) in the presence of the different compounds.
Twenty-four hours following initiation of the treatment, cells were harvested and processed for flow cytometry analysis. Results are illustrated as percentage of
apoptotic cells and are from a representative independent experiment that was repeated thrice with similar results. *, P < 0.05.

PI-103 is able to more effectively inhibit the proliferation of vGPCRexpressing endothelial cells.
PI-103 promotes apoptosis in vGPCR-expressing endothelial
cells. Close examination of PI-103–treated versus rapamycintreated EC-vGPCR cells revealed lower total cell numbers in the
cells treated with the dual PI3Ka/mTOR inhibitor, suggesting that
treatment with PI-103 may also more effectively promote cell death
compared with rapamycin. We therefore set out to compare the
efficacy of PI-103 in promoting apoptosis of endothelial cells
expressing vGPCR. We cultured EC-vGPCR cells in the presence of
LY294002, rapamycin, or PI-103 and analyzed the samples by flow
cytometry 24 h following initiation of the treatment. Transient
exposure (6 h) to PI-103 induced apoptosis in 31% of the cells
compared with 20% in rapamycin-treated cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 4A).
Prolonged treatment (24 h) with PI-103 was also associated with
higher levels of apoptosis (55%) compared with rapamycin (38%;
P < 0.05; Fig. 4B). The sensitivity of EC-vGPCR survival was higher
than that of the parental SVEC endothelial cell line (results not
shown), again emphasizing the importance of the Akt/mTOR

www.aacrjournals.org

pathway for vGPCR-expressing cells. These results suggest that
PI-103 is able to induce apoptosis of vGPCR-expressing endothelial
cells more effectively than rapamycin.
PI-103 effectively inhibits tumor growth in an allograft
model for KS. These observations prompted us to study the
therapeutic potential of PI-103 as an anti-KS treatment. We therefore
established KS tumor allografts by injecting EC-vGPCR cells in
athymic nu/nu mice. Once lesions were established, tumor volume
was measured and then converted into tumor weight at different time
points as described in Materials and Methods. When estimated
tumor weight reached f0.25 g (day 45), animals were treated with
either PI-103 or vehicle (control) i.p. for 18 consecutive days (26).
Tumor regression in PI-103–treated animals was observed within
2 days after the initiation of treatment, and inhibition of tumor
growth was sustained for the duration of the experiment (Fig. 5A). At
the end of the study (day 62), we observed that the average estimated
weight of vehicle-treated tumors was 1,312 mg, an f4-fold increase
in 17 days. However, the PI-103–treated group showed minimal
growth over the same period, with an average estimated tumor

weight of 460 mg on day 62 (Fig. 5A), representing only a 1.7-fold
increase in tumor mass 17 days after the initiation of the treatment
with the drug. Drug toxicity, as assessed by weight loss, was minimal
in the treated group (reduction <5%) during the treatment period
(results not shown).
Tumors from PI-103–treated animals showed decreased
cellularity (Fig. 5B). Tumor cell proliferation, as assessed by
the incorporation of BrdUrd, from PI-103–treated animals was
also diminished compared with control animals (Fig. 5C). In
contrast, detection of apoptotic cells using TUNEL reaction
showed increased cell death in PI-103–treated tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis of these tumors also showed a dramatic
reduction in the levels of P-S6 compared with control animals
(Fig. 5C). Of note, treatment of animals with PI-103 before
establishment of tumors completely prevented tumor formation
(results not shown). Taken together, our data provide the basis
for the early assessment of molecules independently inhibiting
the Akt and mTOR pathways, including PI-103, as an anti-KS
therapy.

Discussion
The Akt/TSC/mTOR pathway, a central player in endothelial cell
biology (8, 10), has been identified as a critical signaling route
in vGPCR-induced Kaposi’s sarcomagenesis (9, 11, 12). We have
previously shown that this viral oncogene stimulates the phosphorylation and inactivation of tuberin (TSC2), promoting the activation
of mTOR and its signaling effectors (12). mTOR activation by vGPCR
is necessary and sufficient for the ability of this viral oncogene to
render expressing endothelial cells oncogenic (12). Moreover, mice
haploinsufficient for TSC2 are predisposed to vascular sarcomas
remarkably similar to KS, suggesting that the vascular tumors
induced by infection with KSHV may be a consequence of the
profound sensitivity of endothelial cells to dysregulation of the
mTOR pathway by vGPCR (12). Indeed, infection of endothelial cells
by KSHV has recently been shown to induce the activation of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, thereby promoting endothelial cell
survival (34). Collectively, these data suggest that drugs targeting
this important signaling route may be an effective therapeutic
approach for the treatment of patients with KS.

Inhibition of PI3Ka/mTOR as a Treatment for KS

Of note, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (sirolimus) has
recently emerged as an effective treatment for renal transplant
patients with KS; the switch from other immunosuppressive
agents to rapamycin leads to remission of dermal KS lesions,
although effective immunosuppression is still provided (14,
35–37). More recently, classic KS has shown a similarly
remarkable sensitivity to treatment with sirolimus (15, 16). This
argues against a reduction in immunosuppression with this drug
compared with other immunosuppressive agents and further
supports a central role for the Akt/TSC/mTOR pathway in KS
pathogenesis.
However, emerging evidence suggests that rapamycin may have
some limitations in its clinical use as an anticancer agent. Several
laboratories have shown that treatment of cancer cell lines with
rapamycin results in a transient paradoxical increase in Akt
phosphorylation, which seems to be due to the loss of negative
feedback regulation in the PI3K/Akt pathway (21–23). This negative
regulatory loop could explain the relative benign nature of tumors
associated with TSC mutations and also may provide a means for
tumor resistance to mTOR inhibition (21, 38).
We show here that exposure of EC-vGPCR cells to increasing doses
of rapamycin leads to an increase of Akt phosphorylation, suggesting
that this drug also interferes with the regulation of PI3K/Akt activity
in endothelial cells expressing vGPCR. As activation of Akt alone is
sufficient to promote endothelial cell transformation in vivo (11),
this may prove to be an Achilles’ heel for rapamycin in the treatment
of KS; this may provide insight into why treatment with rapamycin
has not been successful in some KS patients (17–20).
To overcome this limitation, we set out to assess the efficacy
of a novel dual PI3Ka/mTOR inhibitor for the treatment of KS.
Combinatorial inhibition of multiple targets has proven to be a
very effective approach in the development of cancer inhibitors
due to the complexity and redundancy of signaling networks
underlying malignant transformation. We show here that PI-103
is able to effectively and independently block activation of both
PI3K and mTOR by vGPCR in expressing endothelial cells. In
turn, PI-103 inhibited the proliferation of endothelial cells
expressing vGPCR in vitro and efficiently inhibited the ability
of this cell line to form tumors in vivo. Inhibition of tumor
growth by PI-103 correlated with the induction of apoptosis
through the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt and mTOR pathways.
Collectively, our results show that PI-103 may prove to be a
more effective treatment for patients with iatrogenic KS.

As drugs that inhibit mTOR have been shown to exhibit potent
immunosuppressive activity, this may potentially discourage its use
in patients with a chronic immunosuppressive state such as occurs
in AIDS-KS patients. Indeed, how mTOR inhibitors affect viral
proliferation (KSHV and HIV) and the immune responses to these
viruses remains unclear. However, the results of several small
clinical studies suggest that immunosuppressive medications might
be safe and effective for patients with stable HIV disease (39).
Moreover, given the importance of immune activation for HIV
disease progression, it has been suggested that pharmacologic
modulation of immune activation may be of potential benefit in
slowing down the rate of AIDS progression (39). In addition, it has
been shown that rapamycin may exert a direct antiretroviral effect
by repressing HIV replication (40). The administration of rapamycin
to nonhuman primates has also been shown to decrease CCR5
mRNA expression in vivo, further suggesting that rapamycin
treatment may promote the prevention and treatment of HIV
infection (41). Of note, it has also been hypothesized that coreceptor
activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by HIV gp120 may
promote the survival of infected T lymphocytes in HIV patients (4).
In light of our results, this suggests that simultaneous inhibition of
both mTOR and PI3K, as occurs with PI-103, may provide an
effective therapeutic approach for patients with AIDS-KS.
Our results may have more broad implications. Emerging
appreciation for rapamycin as an antiangiogenic treatment
suggests that drugs targeting the mTOR pathway may prove to
be an effective antiangiogenic strategy for the treatment of a
variety of diseases. Indeed, as KS may serve as a model for tumorinduced or pathologic angiogenesis, our results collectively provide
the basis for the early assessment of PI-103 as an anti-KS and
antiangiogenic chemotherapeutic agent.
