ABSTRACT
Targeting the Mdm2 oncoprotein by drugs has the potential of re-establishing
p53 function and tumor suppression. However, Mdm2-antagonizing drug candidates,
e. g. Nutlin-3a, often fail to abolish cancer cell growth sustainably. To overcome
these limitations, we inhibited Mdm2 and simultaneously a second negative regulator
of p53, the phosphatase Wip1/PPM1D. When combining Nutlin-3a with the Wip1
inhibitor GSK2830371 in the treatment of p53-proficient but not p53-deficient cells,
we observed enhanced phosphorylation (Ser 15) and acetylation (Lys 382) of p53,
increased expression of p53 target gene products, and synergistic inhibition of cell
proliferation. Surprisingly, when testing the two compounds individually, largely
distinct sets of genes were induced, as revealed by deep sequencing analysis of
RNA. In contrast, the combination of both drugs led to an expression signature that
largely comprised that of Nutlin-3a alone. Moreover, the combination of drugs, or the
combination of Nutlin-3a with Wip1-depletion by siRNA, activated p53-responsive
genes to a greater extent than either of the compounds alone. Simultaneous inhibition
of Mdm2 and Wip1 enhanced cell senescence and G2/M accumulation. Taken together,
the inhibition of Wip1 might fortify p53-mediated tumor suppression by Mdm2
antagonists.

INTRODUCTION

induced by cell stress signaling events, through a cascade
of phosphorylations and acetylations. The p53-responsive
genes and their products induce cell cycle arrest and/
or senescence (e. g. p21/CDKN1A), or apoptosis (e. g.
Puma/BBC3). A third set of p53-inducible genes provides
negative feedback on p53 activity, thereby attenuating the
initial p53 response.
The expression of the negative regulator Mdm2
can be induced by p53. The Mdm2 protein binds to p53
and interferes with transactivation. Moreover, Mdm2 is
an E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to p53 ubiquitination and
proteasomal destabilization. The Mdm2 gene is amplified
in a considerable proportion of malignant tumors, most

The tumor suppressor p53 is mutant in roughly 50%
of all human malignancies, making it the most frequently
mutated gene in human cancers. However, this notion also
implies that another 50% of cancers still carry wild type
p53 and nonetheless become malignant. In these cases,
the tumor-suppressive activity of p53 is attenuated by
regulatory mechanisms [1].
The best-characterized activity of p53 consists in
transcriptional activation, through binding to its cognate
promoter elements and recruiting transcription initiation
factors as well as chromatin modifiers. This activity can be

notably in sarcomas. In these cases, excessive amounts
of Mdm2 largely abolish the tumor suppressive activity
of p53. However, even when the copy number of the
Mdm2 gene is normal, the p53-antagonizing activity of
Mdm2 can still be exaggerated in tumors. The most wellestablished mechanisms for this consist in the silencing
of a negative regulator of Mdm2, p14ARF (the second
product of the gene CDKN2A), or in the enhanced
expression of the heterodimerization partner of Mdm2,
MdmX/Mdm4 [2].
Given the frequent silencing of p53 by the Mdm2
oncoprotein in tumors, it is conceivable that disrupting the
interaction between the two proteins might re-establish
p53-mediated tumor suppression [3]. Furthermore, the
p53-binding structure on Mdm2, a hydrophobic pocket
domain, can be occupied by a small molecule, making this
one of the earliest example of “drugging” a protein-protein
interaction. The most established compound to achieve
this is Nutlin-3a [4], shortly referred to as Nutlin from
here on. Nutlin binds to Mdm2, competing with p53. As a
consequence, p53 becomes more active as a transcription
factor and accumulates as a relatively stable protein, due
to the lack of ubiquitination by Mdm2 [4].
Most cells respond to Nutlin largely by a reversible
cell cycle arrest. Only a few cell lines - the majority of
which containing heavily amplified Mdm2 - respond with
apoptosis, thus rendering the drug efficient in cell killing.
In the meantime, a number of drug candidates with similar
structure and/or activity as Nutlin have been developed
and have entered clinical trials [3, 5]. A major concern in
these trials consists in a possible lack of efficacy. Since
many tumor cells merely arrest in response to Nutlin but
resume proliferation once the drug is taken off, the clinical
response might be transient at best. One way to get around
this problem is to select tumors with a high frequency of
Mdm2 amplifications, e. g. dedifferentiated liposarcomas
[6, 7]. Another way to fortify the efficacy of Nutlin and
related drugs would be to combine them with additional
compounds. This require targets that, when inactivated
along with Mdm2, trigger an additive or even synergistic
response.
Besides Mdm2, at least one additional p53responsive gene product antagonizes p53 activity. The
gene Wip1/PPM1D, originally named after its plant
homologue “wound-induced protein” [8], is induced by
p53 [9]. Its product is a phosphatase that dephosphorylates
a variety of proteins that are substrates to the kinase
Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) [10] or related
DNA damage-responsive pathways, e. g. ATM itself,
Chk2 [11, 12], Chk1 [13] Histone 2AX [14-16], Mdm2
[17] and p53 [13, 18]. The phosphorylation of p53
near its aminoterminus (e. g. at the residues Ser15 and
Ser20) facilitates the association of acetyl transferases
(e. g. p300 and CBP) with p53 and the subsequent
acetylation of carboxyterminal residues [19]. This in turn
enhances the binding of p53 to its target promoters. The
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phosphorylated aminoterminal domain then activates
transcription, rendering p53 phosphorylation an essential
trigger for gene activation [19]. When p53 induces Wip1,
the dephosphorylation of p53 counteracts this activity
and thus provides a negative feedback, similar to Mdm2.
Like Mdm2, Wip1 can drive malignancy. This can
happen through gene amplification, but also by truncating
mutations near the 3’ end of the coding region, destroying
a negative regulatory domain of the Wip1 protein [20-24].
Most Wip1/PPM1D-amplified tumors harbor wild type
p53, further arguing that the inactivation of p53 is at least
one of the major activities of Wip1 [25].
Specific Wip1 inhibitors have recently been
designed. In particular, the drug candidate GSK2830371
was shown to efficiently and specifically interfere with the
phosphatase activity of Wip1 through allosteric inhibition
[26]. These inhibitors increase the phosphorylation of
Wip1 substrates, including p53, and lead to a moderate
increase in the expression of some p53 target genes.
However, the cytotoxic efficacy of the inhibitors seemed
moderate [26].
Of note, Mdm2 and Wip1 are acting by largely
independent mechanisms. While Mdm2 triggers the
degradation of p53 through the proteasome, Wip1
dephosphorylates its transactivating domain. This argues
that inhibiting just one of these antagonists may be
insufficient for full p53 activation. Instead, it would be
more plausible to boost p53 activity by targeting both
of these major antagonists simultaneously. In fact, the
depletion or inactivation of both Wip1 and Mdm2 yields
strong p53 activity [27-30].
Here we show that the combined inhibition of
Mdm2 and Wip1 indeed abolishes cell proliferation in
a synergistic and sustainable fashion. When applied
together, Nutlin-3a and GSK2830371 induce strong
accumulation of phosphorylated and acetylated p53. They
also induce the accumulation of p53 target gene products
in a p53-dependent fashion. Importantly, the genes
induced by Mdm2 inhibition vs. Wip1 inhibition alone
were largely distinct. Combining both drugs, however,
primarily activated a large set of p53-responsive genes.
Many of these genes were induced to a greater extent
by the combination, rather than by Nutlin alone. Taken
together, inhibiting Mdm2 and Wip1 simultaneously may
represent a viable strategy to achieve strong p53 activation
and permanent growth arrest, thereby diminishing or even
preventing tumor progression.

measured daily as in A. Using the Chou-Talalay method [31], the combination index (CI) was calculated. At day 6, strong synergism was

microscopy. Both drugs were used at concentrations known
to increase p53 levels or to enhance the phosphorylation of
ATM substrates (Supplemental Figure S1). Nonetheless,
neither of the drugs prevented cell proliferation over
this period of time, although Wip1 inhibition did slow
down the growth rate to some extent. In contrast, the
combination of both inhibitors profoundly compromised
the outgrowth of both cell lines and prevented confluency
over the entire duration of the experiment, with the MCF-7
cells being particularly responsive (Figure 1A). Thus, the
two drugs did cooperate to abolish cancer cell proliferation
in a sustainable fashion.
To determine whether the two compounds act in

a formally synergistic way, we first determined the drug
concentrations that reduce cell proliferation by 25% or
50% (IC25 and IC50, respectively). The drugs were then
continuously applied to the cells at IC25 and IC50, alone
or in combination, and the reduction in proliferation was
determined six days after drug removal (Figure 1B).
This allowed us to calculate the combination index (CI)
according to the algorithm by Chou and Talalay [31]. As
a result, CIs far below 1 were obtained, indicating strong
synergism between the drugs. Thus, inhibition of Mdm2
and Wip1 not only add up to impair cell growth, but they
truly synergize to provide permanent growth arrest.

In combination with Wip1 inhibitor, Nutlin
induces the accumulation of phosphorylated and
acetylated p53

We first depleted Wip1 from U2OS cells by siRNA and
then monitored the expression of p53-responsive genes
by quantitative RT-PCR, in the presence or absence of
Nutlin. Indeed, the depletion of Wip1 increased the ability
of Nutlin to augment the expression levels of p21, PUMA
and PIG3 (Supplemental Figure S3A-S3D). Furthermore,
when depleting Wip1 by siRNA, Nutlin compromised
cell proliferation to a greater extent than upon control
transfection (Supplemental Figure S3E). Thus, Wip1
depletion largely phenocopies Wip1 inhibition when
combined with an Mdm2 inhibitor, strongly suggesting
that the cooperation of Nutlin and Wip1i actually depends
on targeting Wip1.

To elucidate the mechanism of action underlying
this drug synergism, we assessed the levels and
modifications of p53, as well as the levels of p53inducible gene products by immunoblot analysis. Wip1
inhibition alone did not detectably affect the activity of
p53 in MCF-7 cells, whereas in U2OS cells, it mildly
increased the phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 and its
acetylation at lysine 382. Correspondingly, the p53 target
gene products p21 and Mdm2 were somewhat increased
by Wip1 inhibition in U2OS cells but not in MCF-7 cells.
Nutlin alone increased the levels of p53 and its target
gene products in both cell lines. Importantly, when both
drugs were combined, modified p53 strongly accumulated,
along with p21 and Mdm2 (Figure 2). Of note, none of
the treatments led to substantial increases in the cleavage
of poly-(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP), strongly
suggesting that the observed reduction in cell numbers (cf.
Figure 1) was not primarily a result of apoptosis. Along
the same line, caspase activity was not induced by Nutlin
or the combination of Nutlin with Wip1i (Supplemental
Figure S2). In conclusion, Wip1 inhibition and Mdm2
inhibition cooperate to increase the phosphorylation and
acetylation of p53, and to enhance the expression of the
p53 target genes p21 and Mdm2.

While each compound induces distinct gene
sets, the combination largely enhances the gene
signature of Nutlin
To obtain a comprehensive overview on the genes
induced by each of the drugs and their combination, we
performed deep sequencing analysis of the RNA obtained
from MCF-7 cells after treatment. As expected, large
numbers of genes were found significantly regulated
by each treatment (Figure 4A, Supplemental Table
1). Surprisingly, the overlap between genes that were
upregulated by Nutlin and by Wip1 inhibition was very
limited, comprising only 7% of the Nutlin-responsive
genes. Thus, Wip1 inhibition alone induces only a small
subset of p53-responsive genes, including CDKN1A, FAS,
and Mdm2. Otherwise, it appears to regulate genes by
other means, e. g. through the phosphorylation of signaling
factors that ultimately affect gene expression. Even more
strikingly, however, the combination of Nutlin and Wip1i
elicited a gene expression signature that was far closer
to Nutlin alone than to Wip1i alone. The combination
largely recapitulated the genes induced by Nutlin alone
but enhanced their number by inducing additional genes,
most of which had not been found inducible by either
drug alone. In addition, gene induction was enhanced for
a lot of Nutlin-responsive genes in the additional presence
of Wip1i. Similarly, while Wip1i did not suppress the
expression levels of any gene to a significant extent,
Nutlin induced downregulation of p53-repressed genes.
The mechanism of p53-mediated gene repression involves
the CDK inhibitor p21 and a repressive complex, as
described previously [33-36]. Importantly, co-treatment
with Wip1i and Nutlin led to the repression of a broader
set of genes which included virtually all the genes that had
been repressed by Nutlin alone, again supporting the view
that the combination broadens and intensifies p53 activity
(Figure 4B), and in agreement with previous studies on the
role of Wip1 in the G2-M checkpoint [37].
Next, we sought to determine the induction of p53responsive genes in a more quantitative fashion, after

The induction of p21 and Mdm2, and growth
inhibition by the drug combination, depend on
p53
Next, we tested whether the inhibitors of Wip1 and
Mdm2 are increasing p21 and Mdm2 levels in a p53dependent fashion. To this end, we treated HCT116 cells
(colon carcinoma, wild type p53, activating truncation of
Wip1 [20]) or an HCT116-derived cell line with targeted
disruption of the p53-encoding genes [32] with the same
drugs, alone or in combination. As expected, we observed
the accumulation of p21 and Mdm2 only in the p53proficient cells (Figure 3A), thereby largely excluding
off-target effects or any other p53-independent effects
of Wip1 and Mdm2 inhibition. In HCT116 cells again,
the two drugs cooperated to induce the accumulation
of phosphorylated and acetylated p53, and to enhance
the expression of p53 target genes. Furthermore, we
monitored the proliferation of HCT116 cells with and
without p53 in response to the drugs. Reduced cell
proliferation upon treatment with Nutlin and/or Wip1i was
only observed in p53-proficient cells but not when p53
was deleted (Figure 3B). Thus, the efficacy of Nutlin and
Wip1i strictly depends on p53. Finally, we tested whether
the knockdown of Wip1 could mimic Wip1 inhibition.

treatment of MCF-7 cells with each or both of the two
drugs. When analyzing mRNA levels by quantitative
RT-PCR, we found that the combination of both drugs
can induce p53-responsive genes up to 50-fold, whereas
single drugs never exceeded 10-fold (Figure 4C). Thus,
combining both drugs leads to a far more efficient
induction of p53 activity than either compound alone.
Of note, this degree of induction was greater than what
was expected based on the immunoblot analysis shown
in Figures 2 and 3. This may be due to the destabilization
of p21 [38] and Mdm2 [39] proteins (but not mRNA)
through the DNA damage response signaling elicited by
Wip1 inhibition. Nonetheless, based on the plethora of
additional p53-responsive genes induced, we propose that
the boost in p53 activity through the combination of both
inhibitors provides an explanation for the sustained growth
arrest of p53-proficient cells observed in Figure 1.
Finally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
revealed that “irradiation” and “p53 signaling pathway”
were by far the most significantly enriched terms
associated with the genes induced by the simultaneous
treatment with Nutlin and Wip1i (Figure 4D; Supplemental
Table 2). Remarkably, gene sets regarding p53 signaling
pathways were induced to a much greater extent in the
combination treatment in comparison to the Nutlin
treatment alone, as indicated by GSEA term ranking.

Finally, we assessed possible mechanisms of how
the combination of Nutlin and Wip1i abolishes cell
proliferation. Of note, we had not observed enhanced
caspase activity or PARP cleavage (Figure 2 and
Supplemental Figure 2), and apoptosis-related pathways
were not among the top hits of our GSEA analysis (Figure
4D), arguing against the idea that apoptosis makes a
major contribution to drug efficacy in this case. On the
other hand, the cells no longer proliferated after combined
treatment, even when the drugs had been removed for
more than a week (Figure 1A). We therefore suspected
that senescence and/or permanent cell cycle arrest was
induced upon drug treatment. Senescence was initially
described as a mechanism of normal cell aging, due to loss
of telomeres. More recently, however, acute senescence
was shown to confer the efficacy of chemotherapeutics in
many cases [41]. Nutlin induces senescence in a variety of
tumor cell lines, albeit to different degrees [42]. We tested
whether Wip1i further enhances the amount of senescent
cells upon Nutlin treatment. p53-proficient HCT116 cells
display senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity
upon treatment with chemotherapeutics [43] and were now
assessed as to their senescence response upon treatment
with Nutlin and Wip1. Indeed, Nutlin induced senescence
in a fraction of cells, but this was further enhanced by
Wip1i, whereas the inhibition of Wip1 alone did not lead
to a detectable senescence response. Actually, the drug
combination exceeded the efficacy of the gemcitabine
control in senescence induction (Figure 6A and 6B). Next,
we analyzed the cell cycle profile upon treatment with
Nutlin, Wip1i and their combination in U2OS cells as well
as p53-proficient or p53-deficient HCT116 cells, using
propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry. In
p53-proficient cells, Nutlin alone or together with Wip1i
reduced the number of cells in S-phase, corresponding to
the capability of p53 to induce cell cycle arrest. However,
the combination of Wip1i and Nutlin also increased the
amount of cells with a 4 n DNA content, corresponding to
G2 or M (Figure 6C). This accumulation was dependent
on p53 and was still observed at 48 h after removing the
drugs (Supplemental Figure S4A- S4D). In conclusion, the
combined inhibition of Mdm2 and Wip1 not only induces
senescence in a fraction of p53-proficient cells, but also
induces a sustainable arrest in G2/M.

Nutlin and the combination of Nutlin with Wip1i
preferentially induce genes with promoters that
physically bind p53
When comparing the induced genes with a database
of promoters that had been found to associate with p53
in response to Nutlin ([40] Gene Omnibus database ID
GSE47043), it turned out that the set of Nutlin-plusWip1i-inducible genes was highly enriched for promoter
occupation by p53. This enrichment was found to a
lesser degree with both of the single drugs, but not in the
control-treated cells (Figure 5A and 5B). We furthermore
identified p53 promoter binding on genes which were even
more responsive towards the combination treatment than
single Nutlin treatment. Indeed, we identified an especially
strong p53 promoter correlation on these genes, indicating
that their transactivation depended on both p53 activity
and stability. In comparison, genes that were repressed
by Nutlin and further repressed by the combinatorial
treatment did not show comparable p53 binding, perhaps
reflecting indirect regulation (Figure 5C and 5D).
Taken together, these results indicate that the
combination of the two inhibitors induces genes that have
p53 associated with their promoters. This notion strongly
suggests that the differential gene regulation by the two
inhibitors is a direct consequence of the observed p53
activation.

development of Mdm2 inhibitors, this strategy appeared
feasible but with limited efficacy. Here we show that the

Combined inhibitors have a considerably greater activity
in conferring cell growth arrest, p53 accumulation, and the
induction of p53-responsive genes. Thus, the combination
of such drugs may provide a stronger anti-cancer treatment
efficacy than the sole use of Mdm2-inhibitors (Figure 6D).
Our results agree with and expand recent reports on
the use of the Mdm2 inhibitors RG7388 or Nutlin-3 and
the Wip1 inhibitor GSK2830371 [29, 30]. In addition to
their observations, we provide evidence that inhibition of
both targets prevents the outgrowth of cells for ten days
(Figure 1), the accumulation of acetylated p53 (Figures 2
and 3), and the finding that each of the inhibitors induces
a largely distinct set of genes, whereas the combination
of both promotes the enhanced expression of a gene
set highly enriched of p53-induced and physically p53associated genes (Figures 4 and 5).
What makes tumor cells susceptible to the combined
treatment? Firstly, a wildtype status for p53 is needed
(Figure 3). Furthermore, hyperactive or amplified Wip1
might well render cells more responsive towards Wip1
inhibition. Indeed, MCF-7, U2OS and HCT116 cells all
either overexpress Wip1 by means of gene amplification,
or carry an activating truncation that removes a regulatory
domain from the carboxyterminal portion of the protein
[20, 29].
Of note, p53 activation may not always lead to
tumor cell killing or permanent cell cycle arrest. On the
contrary, we and others have previously observed that
p53 activation by Nutlin can have a protective function
on cells. Nutlin protects p53-proficient cells against
nucleoside analogues and other inducers of replicative
stress [44, 45], by temporarily preventing the entry to S
phase but perhaps also by regulation of BRCA1 expression
[46]. This is generally true with regard to p53-inducing
agents [47-50]. Moreover, we have recently shown that
Nutlin also provides resistance of cells towards inhibitors
of Wee1, a kinase that prevents premature mitosis [51].
Thus, when taking Nutlin and Wip1i to the clinics, care
must be taken not to schedule their administration with
drugs that require cell cycle progression for their efficacy.
Besides nucleoside analogues, antagonists of the mitotic
spindle, e. g. taxanes, were shown to be impaired in their
efficacy by Nutlin [52], and we anticipate that the same
will happen when trying to combine Wip1i, Nutlin, and
spindle poisons.
On the other hand, some treatments might further
synergize with inhibitors of Wip1 and Mdm2. In
particular, it is conceivable that the induction of DNA
damage, e. g. through ionizing irradiation, will trigger an
ATM-driven response which is no longer counterbalanced
by Wip1. This might then further augment the activity of
p53 and other pro-apoptotic factors, thereby inducing cell
death rather than the mere arrest of cell proliferation. A
similar cooperative effect might also be achieved using
BH3 mimetics [53] to increase the pro-apoptotic signal
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

at the mitochondria, thereby tipping the balance towards
apoptotic cell death.
Finally, interfering with the interaction of p53 and
Mdm2 may not provide a block of all Mdm2-induced
oncogenic activities. We have recently shown that
Mdm2 associates with the polycomb repressor complex
2 (PRC2) and enhances its activities in suppressing gene
expression, thus enabling a stem cell phenotype [54].
This activity of Mdm2 is not conferred by its p53-binding
region and is thus not detectably affected by Nutlin. To
achieve a broader inhibition of Mdm2 in most of its
actions, inhibition of the RING finger domain and its E3
ubiquitin ligase activity might be more toxic to cancer
cells. Such RING finger inhibitors were described [55],
and their combination with Wip1i might yield a more
thorough response of tumor cells. Finally, inhibitors that
simultaneously interfere with the action of Mdm2 and its
heterodimerization partner MdmX/Mdm4 were recently
published [56], again showing a broader activity against
tumor cells, and may thus warrant combination strategies
with Wip1i.
Interfering with Mdm2 to restore the tumor
suppressive activity of p53 appears like an attractive
but insufficient strategy in most cases. However, the
simultaneous interference with additional negative
regulators and feedback loops raises the perspective of
further boosting p53 and its ability to accumulate, activate
transcription, abolish proliferation, and suppress tumor
progression.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and treatment
U2OS (Osteosarcoma, p53 wild type) and MCF7 (breast carcinoma, p53 wild type) were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM). HCT116
cells (colon cancer, p53 wild type or with a targeted
deletion of p53 [32]) were maintained in McCoys 5A
medium (1x). Cell culture media were supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. Cells were
maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5%
CO2. For treatment of cells, Nutlin-3a (Sigma N6287),
GSK2830371 (Active Biochem,CAS#:1404456-53-6)
stock solutions were prepared in DMSO and then diluted
in pre-warmed medium and added to the cells for the
indicated periods of time.

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and the
treatment was carried out as mentioned. The confluency
of the cells was measured using a Celigo cell cytometer
(Nexcelom; labeled as Day 0). After 24/48/72 h, the
31633

Oncotarget

medium was replaced with fresh media; the confluency
was determined again (Day 1); subsequent measurements
were made every 24 h and media was changed every 48 h.

normalized to treatment with the DMSO solvent alone.
Using the software CompuSyn (www.combosyn.com),
the combination index (CI) for the drug combinations was
calculated (Chou, Talalay 2010). CI values > 1 describe
antagonistic or non-synergistic effects of two drugs, CI =
1 indicates additive effects and CI values < 1 correspond
to synergistic effects of combined drug treatment.

Transfection of human cells
Transient transfection of U2OS cells with siRNAs
to knock down PPM1D (Ambion silencer select s16288
and s16289, Thermo Fisher), and a corresponding control
siRNA was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000.
Lipofectamine and siRNA were dissolved separately in
DMEM(without FCS, Glutamine, and antibiotics) and
incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Later, they
were combined and incubated for another 20 min. In one
well of a 6-well plate, around 250,000 cells were seeded
in 1.5 mL DMEM with supplements, and 500 μl of the
Lipofectamine-siRNA mix were added drop-wise. The
cells were harvested 48 h after transfection.

RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real
time quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol®
(Invitrogen). mRNA was reverse-transcribed using oligodT and random hexameric primers, followed by qRT-PCR
analysis using SYBR Green (Invitrogen). Gene expression
levels were normalized to the mRNA encoding HPRT1,
and the analysis was conducted using the ΔΔCt method.
qRT-PCR primer sets were chosen as follows:
Primer sequences for gene expression studies in human
cells

Immunoblot analysis
Cells were harvested in protein lysis buffer (20
mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA,
1 mM EGTA, 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 2 M Urea,
Protease inhibitor Cocktail, Roche). After 10 min lysis on
ice, samples were briefly sonicated to disrupt DNA-protein
complexes. Total protein concentration was measured
using a Pierce BCA Protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific
Fisher). After boiling the samples in Laemmli buffer at
95°C for 5 min, equal amounts of protein samples were
separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose,
and visualized with the following antibodies: PARP1
(9542, Cell Signalling), γH2AX (S139) (9718, Cell
Signalling), β-Actin (ab8227 abcam), p21 (2947, Cell
signalling), Mdm2 (OP 46, Calbiochem), p53K382Ac
(252S, Cell Signalling), p53phosphoS15 (9287S, Cell
Signalling), p53 (DO-1 sc-126, Santa Cruz), phospho
Chk2 (C13C1 2197, Cell Signalling).

RNA sequencing

Determination of drug synergism

For RNA-sequencing, the quality of total RNA was
determined using the Bioanalyzer 2100 from Agilent. All
samples analyzed exhibited a RNA Integrity Number >
8. Library preparation was conducted using the TruSeq
RNA LT SamplePrep Kit (Illumina), starting from 1000
ng of total RNA. Barcodes for sample preparation were
used according to the indications given by the protocol.
Accurate quantitation of cDNA libraries was performed
with the QuantiFluor™dsDNA System (Promega).
The size range of final cDNA libraries was determined
applying the DNA 1000 chip on the Bioanalyzer 2100,
(Agilent; 290-310 bp). cDNA libraries were amplified
and sequenced via cBot and HiSeq 2000 (Illumina; SR,
1×50 bp, 6 Gb/sample ca. 30 million reads per sample).
Sequence images were transformed with Illumina software
BaseCaller to bcl files, which were demultiplexed to

Synergism between Nutlin and Wip1i was
determined in MCF-7 and U2OS cells. 2000 cells of
MCF-7 and U2OS were seeded on 24-well plates.
After 24 h, they were treated with the IC 25 and IC 50
concentrations of the individual drugs, Nutlin-3a (Nutlin)
and GSK2830371 (Wip1i). For MCF-7 cells, IC 25 and
IC 50 for Nutlin was found to be 10µM and 20µM, and
IC 25 and IC 50 for Wip1i was 20µM and 40µM. For
U2OS cells, IC 25 and IC 50 for Nutlin was found to be
10µM and 20µM, and for Wip1i, IC 25 and IC 50 was
30µM and 40µM. The confluency of cells was measured
using a Celigo cell cytometer (Nexcelom). The cell
confluency obtained for each drug concentration was

fastq files with CASAVA (version 1.8.2). Quality check
was performed via FastQC (version 0.10.1, Babraham
Bioinformatics). Fastq files were mapped to the human
reference transcriptome (UCSC hg19) using Tophat
(Galaxy Version 0.9) [57] Read counts for each sample
and each gene were aggregated using a htseq-count
[58]. DESeq2 (version 1.10.1) was used for measuring
differential expression[59]. RNA library preparation and
sequencing was done by the Transcriptome Analysis
Laboratory (TAL, Göttingen).
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) from C2
curated gene sets (provided by the Molecular Signatures
Database (MSigDB) v5.0) was performed using variance
stabilized normalized read counts. [60, 61]. The threshold
of significant enrichment (q≤0.25) was implied according
to the GSEA standards (http://www.broadinstitute.org/
gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html).

Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with
DMSO, Nutlin, Wip1i, and Nutlin+Wip1i. After fixation
in ethanol, the cells were washed with 0.05% Triton-X
in PBS. Subsequently, the cells were resuspended in
1 mg/ml RNAse A solution in PBS and incubated for
30 min at 37°C, and then with propidium iodide (final
concentration: 30 µg/ml). Flow cytometry was performed
using the Guava PCA-96 Base System (Millipore), and
the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was
determined using the Guava Express Pro software.

Correlation of RNA-Seq and p53 ChIP-seq data
Raw data for p53 ChIP-Sequencing [40] were
downloaded from the Gene Omibus database (ID
GSE47043). The reads were mapped to the human
reference genome (UCSC hg19) using Bowtie (version
1.0.0) [62]. Peak calling was done by Model-based
Analysis of ChIP-Seq (version 1.4.2 [63]. Coverage was
determined by normalizing the total number of mapped
reads per hundred million. p53 enrichment was analyzed
on the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) of genes that
were upregulated in MCF-7 cells after Nutlin and after
Nutlin+Wip1i treatment using deeptools functions [64]
based on the Galaxy framework [65].

Caspase activity assay
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated
with drugs, At 24h post-treatment, cells were harvested
(inclusive of medium) and centrifuged at 1500xg for
5 min at 4oC. The pelleted cells were resuspended in
250µl caspase lysis buffer (1M Tris-HCl, 2mM MgCl2,
150mM NaCl, 10mM DTT, protease-inhibitor (Roche
complete mini)). They were shock-frozen thrice in
liquid nitrogen and centrifuged at 15,000xg for 15 min
at 4oC. 40µl of lysate was pipetted per well in a 96-well
plate in triplicates. 10µl of Ac-DEVD-AMC substrate
(working concentration 25µM) (ALX-260-031 Enzo) was
added to each sample. Caspase activity was measured
using a fluorometer (Synergy MX 267137) at excitation
wavelength 380nm and emission wavelength 460nm every
10 min for 4 h at 37oC.
