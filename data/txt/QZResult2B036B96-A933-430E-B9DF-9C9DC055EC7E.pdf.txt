Abstract
IFN-a is an antineoplastic agent in the treatment of several solid and hematologic malignancies that exerts
strong immune- and autoimmune-stimulating activity. However, the mechanisms of immune activation by IFN-a
remain incompletely understood, particularly with regard to CD4þCD25highFoxpþ regulatory T cells (Treg). Here,
we show that IFN-a deactivates the suppressive function of human Treg by downregulating their intracellular
cAMP level. IFN-a–mediated Treg inactivation increased CD4þ effector T-cell activation and natural killer
cell tumor cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, repression of cAMP in Treg was caused by IFN-a–induced MAP–ERK
kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)–mediated phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) activation
and accompanied by downregulation of IFN receptor (IFNAR)-2 and negative regulation of T-cell receptor
signaling. IFN-a did not affect the anergic state, cytokine production, Foxp3 expression, or methylation state
of the Treg-speciﬁc demethylated region (TSDR) within the FOXP3 locus associated with a stable imprinted
phenotype of human Treg. Abrogated protection by IFN-a–treated Treg in a humanized mouse model of
xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease conﬁrmed IFN-a–dependent regulation of Treg activity in vivo.
Collectively, the present study unravels Treg inactivation as a novel IFN-a activity that provides a conceivable
explanation for the immune-promoting effect and induction of autoimmunity by IFN-a treatment in patients
with cancer and suggests IFN-a for concomitant Treg blockade in the context of therapeutic vaccination
against tumor antigens. Cancer Res; 73(18); 5647–56. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
IFN-a is a well-known antineoplastic drug that exhibits
both antitumoral and immune-stimulating activities (1, 2).
Among IFNs, IFN-a2 has been most broadly clinically evaluated and established as a treatment in a multitude of malignancies, including several hematologic malignancies and
solid tumors (3–5). Direct effects on tumor cells include
inhibition of growth-promoting cytokines, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and enhancement of
tumor cell immunogenicity. Immune-stimulating actions
of IFN-a are promotion of dendritic cell (DC) maturation,
facilitation of T-cell activation, and stimulation of natural

killer (NK) cell activity. Therapeutically applied, IFN-a also
increases the risk for development of autoimmune symptoms
as frequently observed in tumor patients upon prolonged
treatment (6, 7).
Induction of autoimmunity by IFN-a has been ascribed to
several mechanisms including ampliﬁcation of T-cell activation and improved survival of activated T cells (6, 7). We
recently observed that IFN-a also interferes with the induction
of T-cell tolerance by reversing human tolerogenic DC function
(8). However, the strong immune-activating and autoimmunestimulating activity of IFN-a suggests that additional immune
regulatory pathways could be affected.
CD4þCD25highFoxp3þ regulatory T cells (Treg) represent a
specialized T-cell subset skewed toward autoantigen recognition that plays a key role in the maintenance of self-tolerance
by repressing immune responses against self-antigens (9, 10).
Owing to their role in preserving the immune privilege of selfantigens, Treg conﬁne the expansion and differentiation of
T cells against tumor-associated self-antigens (11). In line,
elevated numbers of Treg in the tumor and tumor-draining
lymphoid tissues of patients with cancer are associated with
poor prognosis (12), and the efﬁciency of cancer vaccination
could be improved by concomitant Treg depletion or blockade
(13, 14). As a consequence, emerging therapies for cancer aim
at the ablation or inhibition of CD4þFoxp3þ Treg. Unfortunately, due to their phenotypic similarity, current strategies
such as anti-CD25 mAb used to deplete or inhibit Treg also
target activated T cells. Remarkably, clinical and immunologic

features observed upon adjuvant IFN-a treatment resemble
immune dysregulation in Treg-deﬁcient individuals. Surprisingly, despite these indications pointing to an inﬂuence of IFNa on Treg activity, the effect of IFN-a on human Treg function
has not been investigated.
Here, we show that IFN-a inhibits the suppressive function
of human Treg by repressing their cAMP production. IFNa–mediated cAMP repression resulted from MEK/ERK-mediated phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) activation by IFN-a. Notably,
IFN-a abolished the suppressive function of Treg without
affecting their differentiation program. In regard to tumor
immunity, functional inhibition of Treg suppression by IFNa increased both CD4þ effector T-cell function and NK cell
tumor cytotoxicity. In summary, these results discover Treg
inactivation as an important new IFN-a function in the context
of cancer therapy.

stimulated with 0.5 mg/mL anti-CD3 mAb (clone OKT-3) in the
presence of irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC; 90 Gy). Alternatively, T cells were stimulated
with 0.5 mg/mL anti-CD3 mAb and 0.25 mg/mL anti-CD28 mAb.
T-cell proliferation was assessed at day 4 by [3H]-thymidine
incorporation. Relative suppressor activity is presented as
mean  SD (proliferation of Teff þ Treg normalized to
proliferation of Teff ¼ 100%).
For blocking of IFNAR2, Treg were preincubated with either
5 mg/mL mouse IgG2a isotype control (BD Pharmingen) or
blocking anti-IFNAR-2 mAb (MMHAR-2; PBL InterferonSource) overnight before subjection to suppressor assays.
For inhibition of PDEs, the PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-xanthine (IBMX, Sigma-Aldrich; 25 mmol/L) or the PDE4-speciﬁc
inhibitor rolipram (Cayman Chemicals; 5 mmol/L), respectively, were added.
Assessment of cAMP production
Teff and Treg were incubated overnight with or without
104 U/mL IFN-a, subsequently stimulated with 0.5 mg/mL antiCD3 mAb and 0.25 mg/mL anti-CD28 mAb for 6 hours, and
cAMP was quantiﬁed using a cAMP-speciﬁc ELISA (Direct
cAMP ELISA, 900-066, AssayDesign). In some experiments, T
cells were incubated with the ERK1/2-speciﬁc inhibitor
(5 mmol/L; FR180204, Calbiochem) or the PDE4-speciﬁc inhibitor rolipram (5 mmol/L; Cayman Chemicals), respectively, 1
hour before IFN-a treatment.
NK cell cytotoxicity assay
Human NK cells were separated using the CD56þCD16þ NK
cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec), resulting in a purity of NK
cells between 90% and 95% (Supplementary Fig. S1). Teff

and Treg were cultured for 2 hours at 37 C with or without
104 U/mL IFN-a in the presence of 0.5 mg/mL anti-human CD3
(clone OKT-3) and 1 mg/mL anti-human CD28 (BD Pharmingen). After washing, Teff or Treg were cocultured with isolated
NK cells (T cell/NK cell ratio: 2:1) for 4 hours. Subsequently,
equal numbers of CFSE (1 mmol/L)-labeled K562 tumor cells
(16) and carboxyﬂuorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (0.1
mmol/L)-labeled PBMC (from the NK cell donor) were added
(NK/K562 ratio 10:1) to the cultured cells for further 4 hours at
37 C. Afterwards, cells were subjected to ﬂow cytometry (BD
FACSCalibur), data were analyzed with Summit v4.0 (Dako),
and killing efﬁciency was determined as the ratio of propidium
iodide-negative CFSElow control cells (syngeneic PBMC) to
CFSEhigh K562 target cells normalized to background cell
death.
DNA isolation and methylation analysis using bisulﬁte
pyrosequencing
Genomic DNA was isolated from 5 to 6  105 T cells. Male
donors were used to avoid possible artefacts due to random x
chromosome inactivation in females. Bisulﬁte treatment of
genomic DNA was conducted using the EpiTect Bisulﬁte Kit
(Qiagen). The methylation status of the FOXP3 Treg-speciﬁc
demethylated region (TSDR) was analyzed by bisulﬁte pyrosequencing, which was conducted on a PSQ96MA Pyrosequencing
System (Biotage) with the PyroGold SQA reagent kit (Biotage;
ref. 17). PCR and sequencing primers for bisulﬁte pyrosequencing were designed using the Pyrosequencing Assay

IFN-a abrogates suppressive activity of human
CD4þCD25highFoxp3þ Treg
To determine whether IFN-a inﬂuences the suppressive
activity of human Treg, suppressor assays with cocultures of
human CD4þCD25 Teff and Treg were set up in the presence
of irradiated costimulatory PBMC with or without IFN-a. In
this setting, Treg inhibited Teff proliferation up to 88%, dependent on the Treg/Teff ratio (Fig. 1A and B). Addition of IFN-a
caused a considerable loss in Treg-mediated suppression
independent of Treg/Teff ratios (Fig. 1A and B).
In mice, IFN-a modulates the suppressive activity of Treg by
affecting the function of antigen-presenting cells (APC; ref. 18).
We therefore compared the effect of IFN-a on human Treg
function in the presence and absence of APC (after stimulation
with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 mAb). However, in contrast to the
murine system, IFN-a abrogated the suppressive function of
human Treg both in the presence (Fig. 1A and B) and absence
of APC (Fig. 1C), showing APC independency of the IFNa–mediated Treg inactivation.

more than 95% of all treated animals, with a median time to
death of 40 days (range, 35–55 days). Development of xenogeneic GvHD was characterized by decelerated growth and
weight loss and was accompanied by massive inﬂammatory
inﬁltration of human T cells into all murine organs (15).
Cotransfer of resting human Treg at a 4:1 ratio (PBMC/Treg)

IFN-a Inhibits Regulatory T Cells by cAMP Repression

clinical outcomes (19, 20). Previously, it was shown that preactivated Treg efﬁciently suppress the cytotoxic activity of NK
cells against tumor cells (Fig. 2; ref. 21). We conﬁrmed these
results using a CFSE-based system of NK-mediated cytotoxicity against K562 tumor cells. Here, activated Treg were
capable of abrogating tumor cell lysis by NK cells (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Fig. S1). Intriguingly, preincubation of Treg
with IFN-a restored NK tumor killing in the presence of Treg
showing that IFN-a overcomes Treg-mediated immune privilege for tumor cells. In contrast with Treg, conventional CD4þ
T cells slightly increased NK tumor killing and were not
affected by IFN-a pretreatment (data not shown).
IFN-a reduces expression of IFNAR-2 on Treg
Analysis of IFNAR-2 expression revealed that Treg express
slightly higher levels of the receptor compared with Teff (Fig.
3A; control T cells without IFN-a: gray lines and bars). In line,
preincubation of Treg with anti-IFNAR-2 mAb signiﬁcantly
counteracted IFN-a–mediated Treg inactivation as compared
with treatment with control mAb (Fig. 3B). However, incubation with IFN-a also induced a signiﬁcant reduction in IFNAR2 expression of both, Teff and Treg (Fig. 3A, black lines and
bars: þ IFN-a), at least suggesting that IFN-a limits its effect by
receptor downregulation in a self-controlling process.
Binding of IFN-a to the IFNAR complex initiates a signaling
cascade comprising phosphorylation and dimerization of
STAT molecules followed by their translocation to the nucleus,
where they regulate the expression of IFN-stimulated genes

(22). Comparison of STAT3 and STAT5 phosphorylation in
Treg and Teff in response to IFN-a revealed no differences
(Supplementary Fig. S2). However, these data are supposedly in
line with previous results showing preferential cAMP-mediated STAT1 inhibition in T cells (23). IFN-a–mediated STAT1
phosphorylation was signiﬁcantly reduced in Treg compared
with Teff (Supplementary Fig. S2). The altered STAT1 activation in Treg was not regulated by upstream Tyk2 phosphorylation (data not shown).
IFN-a does not affect the Treg differentiation program
It has been previously suggested that plasmacytoid DCs
impair the regulatory function of Treg by inducing Treg
apoptosis through IFN-a (24). To determine whether IFN-a
induces apoptosis in Treg, Teff and Treg were incubated
with IFN-a, and the frequency of viable or dead cells was
subsequently evaluated by Trypan blue (data not shown) or
Annexin-V staining. Apoptosis rates of Teff versus Teff þ
IFN-a (15.3  8.9 vs. 13.6  8.3) and of Treg versus Treg þ
IFN-a (25.6  9.7 vs. 25.9  6.7) did not signiﬁcantly differ,
excluding increased cell death as a cause for IFN-a diminished suppressor activity.
A couple of Treg-associated surface molecules seem to be
important for function, activation, and homeostasis of Treg
populations (9, 10, 12). However, expression of Treg differentiation molecules CTLA-4, CD127, CD39, CD62L, CD147, ICOS,
IL1-R, TNFR2, CCR7, HLA-DR, and CD45RO/RA remained
unaffected by IFN-a treatment (data not shown).

As previously reported, IL-10 contributes to the regulatory
activity of Treg (10) and its production is increased in CD4þ T
cells after IFN-a treatment (25). IFN-a neither affected IL-10 nor
IFN-g production of Treg (Fig. 4A). In Treg/Teff cocultures, both
IFN-g and IL-10 levels were slightly increased by IFN-a reﬂecting
reduced Treg activity (Fig. 4A), whereas no alterations in IL-2
and TGF-b amounts were observed (data not shown).

It is widely accepted that the suppressive function of Treg is
linked to their anergic state, associated with low IL-2 production in vitro (9, 10). However, IFN-a did not induce Treg
proliferation as assessed by [3H] thymidine incorporation (Fig.
1A and B) and by ﬂow cytometry of Treg in suppressor assays
(data not shown). Thus, abrogation of Treg suppressive activity
by IFN-a does not involve reversion of Treg anergy.

IFN-a Inhibits Regulatory T Cells by cAMP Repression

IFN-a–treated Treg resulted in recovery of cAMP levels, conﬁrming PDE4-mediated cAMP degradation as key mechanism
in IFN-a–mediated Treg inactivation (Fig. 5D).
PDE4 isoforms are functionally regulated by the ERK2 MAP
kinase, and activation of the MEK/ERK pathway in turn
belongs to the prominent actions of IFN-a in human CD4þ
T cells (22, 31). We therefore additionally examined whether
IFN-a–induced cAMP deprivation in Treg is affected by an
ERK inhibitor. Blockade of the ERK signaling pathway prevented IFN-a–induced cAMP degradation in Treg (Fig. 5E),
conﬁrming ERK-driven PDE4 activation as a molecular mechanism in IFN-a–mediated cAMP downregulation in Treg.

Compelling evidence suggests that the transcription factor
Foxp3 acts as a master switch governing the development and
function of Treg (9, 10). Recently, an evolutionary conserved
CpG-rich element within the FOXP3 locus was found to be
demethylated in Treg (26). This TSDR was associated with
transcriptional activity and a stable imprinted phenotype of
Treg (26). We therefore additionally analyzed methylation of
the TSDR in Treg in response to IFN-a treatment. Teff with
high methylation state of the TSDR served as controls (Fig. 4B).
However, bisulﬁte pyrosequencing of the TSDR revealed
unchanged methylation levels, both in resting and activated
Treg upon IFN-a incubation compared with untreated control
Treg (Fig. 4B), ruling out epigenetic modulation of Foxp3 as a
target of IFN-a–induced Treg inactivation. These data are in
line with our ﬁnding that IFN-a–mediated Treg inactivation,
including cAMP repression, did not result in an alteration of
the Foxp3 expression in Treg (Supplementary Fig. S3).

IFN-a negatively regulates T-cell receptor signaling in
Treg
Because Treg upregulate their cAMP content in response to
T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement (27–29) and cAMP has been
shown to participate in regulation of TCR-mediated signaling
(32, 33), we analyzed the impact of IFN-a on Src tyrosine kinase
p56lck-mediated ZAP-70 phosphorylation at the Tyr319 residue
as a direct TCR-related downstream signaling event. Importantly, preincubation of Treg with IFN-a resulted in decreased
ZAP-70 activation in response to TCR stimulation (Fig. 6),
revealing modulation of TCR signaling in human Treg by IFNa. However, reduction of the cAMP level in Treg by an
adenylate cyclase inhibitor (MDL-12) did not affect ZAP-70
phosphorylation, suggesting that the IFN-a–mediated modulation of TCR-mediated signaling in Treg may not be directly
linked to the cAMP level (Supplementary Fig. S4; ref. 15).

IFN-a induces cAMP deprivation in Treg
As reported recently, upregulation of endogenous cAMP is
required for the suppressor function of murine and human
Treg (27–29). Consistent with previous reports, assessment of
cytosolic cAMP concentrations revealed that Teff produced
substantially lower amounts of cytosolic cAMP compared with
Treg (Fig. 5A; ref. 27). IFN-a–mediated functional impairment
of human Treg was associated with signiﬁcantly repressed
cAMP upregulation in activated Treg, corroborating the previously identiﬁed cAMP dependency of Treg-suppressive function (Fig. 5A).
Intracellular cAMP levels can be regulated by alterations in
the rate of synthesis by adenylate cyclases, degradation by
PDEs, or excretion. Human T cells predominantly express the
PDE isoforms, PDE4B and PDE4D (30). Blocking PDE activity
by the PDE inhibitor IBMX or by the PDE4-speciﬁc inhibitor
rolipram, respectively, abrogated IFN-a–induced cAMP deprivation and restored the regulatory activity signifying a role of
cAMP degradation in IFN-a–mediated Treg inhibition (Fig. 5B
and C). Furthermore, speciﬁc inhibition of PDE4 activity in

To investigate the effect of IFN-a treatment on Treg-suppressive activity in vivo, we resorted to a previously established
xenogeneic GvHD model induced by human T cells in immunodeﬁcient mice that is applicable for the functional analysis of
human Treg (15, 34). Upon intraperitoneal engraftment with

IFN-a exhibits signiﬁcant effects in promoting tumorgenicity through activation of immune cells and repression of
tumor growth. Herein, we show that IFN-a signiﬁcantly inactivates the suppressive function of human Treg and thereby
releases CD4þ T cells and NK cells from Treg-mediated suppression. Thus, abrogation of Treg activity by IFN-a adds a
novel and conceivable explanation for the immune-promoting
effect of IFN-a in malignancies (3–5), including frequently
observed autoimmune symptoms upon continuous therapeutic application (6, 7). In line with this assertion, IFN-a treatment has been previously observed to reduce Treg numbers in
patients with melanoma or renal cell carcinoma (37, 38),
whereas, conversely, declining IFN-a levels and impaired
IFN-a signaling in patients with cancer seem to be correlated
with an increase in the number of Treg and a higher risk of
cancer progression (39–41). Recent reports on improved
immune responses upon co-administration of IFN-a with
peptide vaccines in renal (42), pancreatic (43), and colorectal
cancer (44) represent additional evidence.
Numerous investigations have ﬁrmly established a key role
of cAMP in the suppressive function of Treg (27–30, 45–47).
Importantly, within the CD4þ T-cell population, Treg exclusively accumulate cAMP. By interfering with the function of
cAMP-producing adenylate cyclases or cAMP-degrading PDEs,
both the suppressive activity and functional state of Treg can
be selectively manipulated (15, 27, 29). It is currently not clear
whether differential cAMP upregulation in human Treg results
from differential enzyme endowment or activity; however, it is
at least known that human T cells predominantly express the
short isoforms PDE4B and PDE4D, which are functionally
regulated by ERK2 MAP kinase, and that engagement of the
TCR leads to recruitment of a b-arrestin/PDE4 complex to lipid
rafts that serves to degrade the local, TCR-induced production
of cAMP (30, 31, 48). Activation of the MEK/ERK pathway again
belongs to the prominent actions of IFN-a in human CD4þ T
cells (22). In our study, both blockade of the MAK kinase ERK1/
2-regulated pathway and speciﬁc inhibition of PDE4 activity
completely restored the suppressor activity and accumulation
of cAMP in IFN-a–treated Treg. Thus, we show here that IFN-a
turns down the cAMP level in Treg by stimulation of the MEK/
ERK pathway (22) leading to ERK-mediated PDE4 activation.

(Fig. 7B) within 2 months (Fig. 7B). In this model, preincubation of Treg with IFN-a abrogated their ability to protect from
disease onset as compared with untreated Treg (Fig. 7A and B),
without affecting their viability (Fig. 7C), signifying a regulatory
role of IFN-a in Treg-suppressive activity in vivo. Human
Treg survived only for limited time in vivo, regardless of their
pretreatment with IFN-a (Fig. 7C, right). However, in agreement with previous reports showing that suppression by
Treg is conﬁned to the very early phase of GvHD (35, 36),
limited survival of human Treg in vivo did not affect their
suppressive activity in GvHD (Fig. 7). As compared with Treginjected animals, the xenoreactive population of human effector T cells in IFN-a-Treg–treated mice expanded over time and
ultimately induced GvHD (Fig. 7C, left).

IFN-a Inhibits Regulatory T Cells by cAMP Repression

IFN-a signals primarily through the Janus-activated kinase
(JAK)/STAT pathway (22). Comparing IFN-a–mediated STAT
signaling in Treg and Teff, we observed similar activation of
STAT3 and STAT5 but signiﬁcantly lower IFN-a–induced
STAT1 activation in Treg. The reason for altered STAT1
phosphorylation in Treg is unclear, however, may be consistent
with a study reporting that cAMP differentially reduces STAT1
activation in T cells (23).
In T cells, the IFN-a receptor not only recruits the JAK–STAT
pathway, but also additionally associates with signaling molecules of the TCR signalosome curtailing their availability in
TCR signal transduction (50). Investigating ZAP-70 phosphorylation in place of TCR signaling in Treg, we observed partly
decreased ZAP-70 phosphorylation in response to TCR stimulation in presence of IFN-a. However, decreased ZAP-70
phosphorylation did not seem to be directly related to the
cAMP level because pharmacologic repression of the second
messenger by adenylate cyclase blockade did not lead to an
altered ZAP-70 activity.
It is widely accepted that the suppressive function of Treg is
linked to their anergic state, expression of Treg functionassociated surface molecules, and production of immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10 (9, 10). Our study revealed that
IFN-a did not affect the anergic state, the cytokine proﬁle, or
expression of surface molecules of human Treg. In addition, the
methylation state of the TSDR within the FOXP3 locus, which is
associated with transcriptional activity and a stable imprinted
phenotype of Treg, remained unaltered by IFN-a. Thus, our
results indicate that IFN-a deactivates the suppressive function of Treg without interfering with their lineage program.
In conclusion, repression of Treg activity by IFN-a may
signiﬁcantly contribute to its antineoplastic effects in cancer

and provide a rational basis to consider IFN-a as a potent Treginactivating drug in the context of therapeutic vaccination
against tumor antigens.
