and Inhibits the Growth of Bevacizumab-Resistant
Glioblastoma

Abstract
Antiangiogenic therapies like bevacizumab offer promise for cancer treatment, but acquired resistance, which
often includes an aggressive mesenchymal phenotype, can limit the use of these agents. Upregulation of b1
integrin (ITGB1) occurs in some bevacizumab-resistant glioblastomas (BRG) whereby, mediating tumor–
microenvironment interactions, we hypothesized that it may mediate a mesenchymal-type resistance to
antiangiogenic therapy. Immunostaining analyses of b1 integrin and its downstream effector kinase FAK
revealed upregulation in 75% and 86% of BRGs, respectively, compared with pretreatment paired specimens.
Furthermore, ﬂow cytometry revealed eight-fold more b1 integrin in primary BRG cells compared with cells from
bevacizumab-na€ve glioblastomas (BNG). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of cells engineered to
express a b1-GFP fusion protein indicated that the mobile b1 integrin fraction was doubled, and half-life of b1
integrin turnover in focal adhesions was reduced markedly in BRG cells compared with bevacizumab-responsive
glioblastoma multiforme cells. Hypoxia, which was increased with acquisition of bevacizumab resistance, was
associated with increased b1 integrin expression in cultured BNG cells. BRGs displayed an aggressive mesenchymal-like phenotype in vitro. We found that growth of BRG xenograft tumors was attenuated by the b1 antibody,
OS2966, allowing a 20-fold dose reduction of bevacizumab per cycle in this model. Intracranial delivery of OS2966
through osmotic pumps over 28 days increased tumor cell apoptosis, decreased tumor cell invasiveness, and
blunted the mesenchymal morphology of tumor cells. We concluded that b1 integrin upregulation in BRGs likely
reﬂects an onset of hypoxia caused by antiangiogenic therapy, and that b1 inhibition is well tolerated in vivo as a
tractable strategy to disrupt resistance to this therapy. Cancer Res; 73(10); 3145–54. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common malignant
brain tumor in adults, with a median survival close to 1 year
(1). To date, only 3 drugs have been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration for glioblastoma treatment,
including, most recently, bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech)
in 2009 (2). Despite improvements in clinical metrics with
bevacizumab including cognitive beneﬁts and reduction of
steroid use (3), 40% of treated patients developed acquired
resistance in phase II trials (4). Thus, as has been the case

with other cancers treated with antiangiogenic therapy, the
promise of antiangiogenesis in glioblastoma remains unfulﬁlled in part due to acquired resistance.
Integrins are cell-adhesion molecules that mechanosense
the microenvironment and elicit extracellular-matrix (ECM)–
induced signaling in both normal and pathologic states such
as inﬂammation and cancer. Importantly, integrins lie at the
interface of the cell and microenvironment, playing a key role
in tumor progression and regulating growth and survival
pathways. Upregulation of integrins has been associated with
epithelial malignancies (5), particularly during invasion,
metastasis, and angiogenesis (6, 7). There is growing evidence
for the role of aberrantly expressed integrins in glioblastoma
pathophysiology (8). b3 and b5 integrins have been implicated
in angiogenesis, and several approaches targeting these molecules are under investigation in the clinic (9). b1 integrins,
which coordinate much broader functional activities such as
inﬂammation, proliferation, adhesion, and invasion, have
recently been implicated in therapeutic resistance in multiple
solid cancer models (10–13) and hematopoietic malignancies
(14, 15). Importantly, this b1 integrin-mediated resistance is
thought to occur at the level of the tumor cells themselves. b1
integrin also has important functions during tumor vascularization such as VEGF-dependent (16) and VEGF-independent
angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell migration (17).

Notably, as shown in glioblastoma models (18–20), we found
that bevacizumab causes U87MG, a commonly studied glioblastoma cell line, to grow more invasively (Supplementary Fig.
S1A), and orthotopic bevacizumab-resistant glioblastoma
(BRG) xenografts inﬁltrate the brain via vessel co-option,
which has been shown to require b1 integrins (21), whereas
bevacizumab-na€ve glioblastoma (BNG) xenografts remain
well circumscribed (Supplementary Fig. S1B; ref. 22). This
evidence, when taken together, led us to investigate the novel
hypothesis that b1 integrin drives resistance to antiangiogenic
therapy by promoting multiple mechanisms at the interface of
tumor cells and the microenvironment.

ice. Cell surface b1 integrin was labeled with anti-b1 integrin
antibodies OS2966 (OncoSynergy, Inc.), CD29 (Clone TS-2/16,
BioLegend), or CD29 (Clone K20, BD). Cell surface c-MET was
detected with Clone 95106 monoclonal antibody (mAb; R&D
Systems). Flow cytometry was conducted with a BD FACS
Calibur II machine, and data were analyzed using FlowJo
software (Tree Star, Inc.).

Materials and Methods

Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
SF8106/B1-GFP and SF7996/B1-GFP cells were seeded at
10,000 cells per well on chambered coverglass (Fisher), which
had been coated overnight with 10 mg/mL ﬁbronectin (SigmaAldrich). Individual cells were analyzed on a Zeiss LSM 510
NLO Meta confocal microscope. Target-bleach regions were
normalized to background observational bleaching. Images
were collected every 30 seconds until ﬂuorescence recovery
plateau. Fractional ﬂuorescence recovery and half-time of
recovery were calculated as described (26).

Collection and analysis of human clinical specimens
Human specimens were obtained from the University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF; San Francisco, CA) Brain
Tumor Tissue Bank (22). Fluorescence immunohistochemistry
of human parafﬁn-embedded tissues for b1 integrin (ab52971;
Abcam), CA9 (Novus Biologicals), FAKY397 (ab4803; Abcam),
GFAP (ab4674; Abcam), and laminin (ab14055; Abcam) was
conducted with either standard indirect or tyramide signal
ampliﬁcation (PerkinElmer) as described (21) following standard citrate buffer (Abcam) antigen retrieval.
Cells and cell lines
U87MG, MDA-MB-231, and SW-1080 cell lines were
obtained from and authenticated by American Type Culture
Collection and passed in less than 6 months. Cells were
maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids
(NEAA), and antibiotics. The bevacizumab-resistant primary
glioblastoma cells, SF7796 and SF8106, and the bevacizumab-na€ve primary glioblastoma cells, SF7996 and SF8244,
were obtained and grown as described (22). Bevacizumabresistant (BRG1, BRG2, and BRG3) and bevacizumab-na€ve
(N1, N2, and N3) cell lines were derived from fresh clinical
resection specimens at UCSF as described (22) and were
propagated in 50% to 50% DMEM/F-12 with 10% FBS, NEAA,
and antibiotics. Primary SF8106 and SF7796 glioma cultures
were transfected with the pFB-Neo Retroviral Vector (Agilent) containing a cDNA expressing the b1-GFP fusion
protein (gift of Martin Humphries; University of Manchester,
UK), followed by selection in 5 mg/mL geneticin (Gibco), as
described (23). Experimental hypoxia was induced by growth
in 1% oxygen as described (24).
Short hairpin RNA-mediated integrin knockdown
U87MG, BRG2, and BRG3 cells were infected with short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral particles (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) targeting b3 integrin (sc-63292-V), b1 integrin (sc35674-V), or vector control (shCTRL, sc-108084) per manufacturer's protocol. After 48 hours, subcultured cells were selected
in 1 mg/mL puromycin for 1 week.
Flow cytometry
Cells were trypsinized in 0.25% trypsin with EDTA,
counted, resuspended in PBS at 106 cells/mL, and kept on

Western blot analysis
Western blots were conducted as described previously (25),
using primary antibody to b1 integrin (Biolegend; Abcam)
along with aV, a5, a4, and b3 antibodies (Cell Signaling).

Dynamic in vitro assays and timelapse microscopy
Adhesion assays were conducted as described (21) on
plates coated with 10 mg/mL ﬁbronectin (Sigma). Scratch
assays were conducted as described (27) on plates coated
with 10 mg/mL ﬁbronectin. Cell spreading assays were conducted by plating 105 cells on a 30-mm dish coated with 10
mg/mL ﬁbronectin. Time-lapse phase-contrast microscopy
was conducted as described (21) with a Zeiss Observer Z1
inverted microscope with an AxioCam MRm and accompanying AxioVision 4.8 software. Brieﬂy, 30-mm dishes were
placed upon a heated stage adapter (Stable Z with heated lid,
Bioptechs), and images were captured every 90 to 180
seconds for up to 24 hours. Media were covered with sterile
embryo-tested mineral oil (Sigma).
Cell adhesion was quantiﬁed as described (21). Cell
spreading was quantitated as cell area (measured hourly)
and percentage of spread cells per high-power ﬁeld. For cell
area, all whole cells in a 40 ﬁeld were measured manually
in ImageJ (NIH) at time zero and every hour for 5 hours.
Means were calculated at each timepoint and compared.
The percentage of spread cells per 40 ﬁeld was similarly
calculated hourly (not including time zero) for 12 hours. Cell
migration and dendricity factor for cell shape were measured as described (22, 28).
Cell proliferation
Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) immunoﬂuorescence was conducted by incubating cells in 10 mmol/L BrdU (Sigma) for 1
hour in complete media followed by ﬁxation in 1% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeated in 0.1% Triton-X100 (Sigma)
in PBS on ice for 5 minutes followed by incubation in biotinylated sheep anti-BrdU antibody (ab2284, Abcam) overnight
at 4 C. Following PBS washes, cells were incubated with
streptavidin-Alexa555 (Invitrogen) and coverslipped with

b1 Integrin Drives Antiangiogenic Therapy Resistance

VectaShield mounting medium with DAPI (VectorLabs). BrdUpositive cells per high-power ﬁeld were counted in three 40
ﬁelds per well, 3 wells per experiment with repeats.

Results

Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry
Mice were sacriﬁced and tissue collected and prepared as
described (21). Cryostat sections (20–30 mm in size) were
collected and mounted directly on slides and were processed
for immunohistochemistry as described (21). For TUNEL
staining, the TMR red In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche)
was used. Immunohistochemistry was conducted using antibodies against b1 (Abcam), laminin (Abcam), GFAP (Millipore), and GLUT-1 (Millipore). Collagen IV immunostaining
was described previously (25).

Upregulation of b1 integrin after acquired resistance to
bevacizumab
We recently reported by microarray analysis and conﬁrmatory PCR that transcription of b1 integrin was upregulated in
glioblastomas exhibiting the nonenhancing inﬁltrative pattern
of growth that is viewed as unique to bevacizumab resistance
(22). To further verify this result, we conducted immunohistochemistry on BRGs and their paired pretreatment specimens
and found increased b1 integrin in 9 of 12 cases (75%, Fig. 1A).
This increased immunoreactivity was observed in both angiogenic blood vessels (Fig. 1A, arrows) and tumor cells (Fig. 1B).
Consistent with bona ﬁde integrin signaling, we found
increased phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase staining in
tumor cells in 6 of 7 BRG cases compared with pretreatment,
with staining tending to be close to ECM (Fig. 1C; refs. 30, 31).
Furthermore, b1 integrin was increased in primary cells from
BRG clinical specimens compared with primary cultures established from BNG specimens by ﬂuorescence-activated cell
sorting (P < 0.05; Fig. 1D). To rule out contributions from
patient variability among clinically derived samples that could
affect integrin expression, we experimentally derived a bevacizumab-resistant xenograft from U87MG (U87-BEV; ref. 25).
Screening of integrin expression revealed that U87-BEV
showed signiﬁcantly higher expression of b1 integrin, along
with aV and a5 integrins, 2 potential b1 heterodimer partners,
which interact to promote ﬁbronectin binding (32), compared
with U87-IGG, a control line treated only with IgG (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B).
Because the percentage of integrin that is mobile and the
turnover of this mobile integrin in focal adhesions sustains
integrin signaling, we engineered BRG and BNG cells to express
a b1-GFP fusion protein and used ﬂuorescence recovery after
photobleaching (FRAP) to measure integrin turnover in focal
adhesions (26). We found 2-fold faster b1 integrin turnover in
focal adhesions and double the mobile fraction of b1 integrin in
bevacizumab-resistant SF8106 cells than in bevacizumabresponsive SF7996 cells (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig.
S2C). Thus, compared with BNG cells, bevacizumab-resistant
cells exhibited more mobile b1 integrin, reﬂective of reduced
cellular membrane barriers to b1 integrin mobility in these
cells and more rapid turnover of b1 integrin in focal adhesions.
To verify the functional relevance of increased b1 integrin in
glioblastoma cells, we conducted cell adhesion assays and
found signiﬁcantly greater adhesion to ECM in BRGs compared with classic glioblastoma lines and even the highly
adhesive MDA-MB-231 human breast adenocarcinoma, which
served as a positive control (Fig. 1F). Thus, the b1 integrin
subunit is functionally upregulated in glioblastoma after
acquired bevacizumab resistance.

Statistical analyses
Student t test was used for parametric comparisons between
paired variables. The Mann–Whitney U test was used for
nonparametric pairwise comparisons. Multivariate analyses
were done with ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett (most analyses)
or Bonferroni tests (e.g., xenograft studies) as appropriate.
P < 0.05 was deemed statistically signiﬁcant.

Hypoxia associated with high b1 integrin expression in
glioblastoma cells
Hypoxia is a common cellular stress, particularly in the
setting of fast-growing cancers and variably during the course
of antiangiogenic therapy. Hypoxia upregulates b1 integrin
expression in the setting of wound healing via hypoxiainducible factor-1a (HIF-1a)–stimulated b1 transcription

Tumor spheroid assays
Aggregation assays were conducted by suspending tumor
cells in PBS on ice for 15 minutes. To visualize b1 integrin, cells
were incubated with Alexa 647 conjugated anti-CD29 (clone
TS-2/16) for 15 minutes, spun down, and rinsed. Cell growth in
acidiﬁed media was conducted as described (29). Spheroidal
growth assays were conducted in 6-well ultra-low adhesion
plates (CoStar) with standard conditions for growth of neurospheres (29) for 3 to 5 days. Spheroid dissolution assays were
conducted by plating spheroids on culture dishes coated with
10 mg/mL of bovine serum albumin (BSA) control, ﬁbronectin,
laminin, or collagen type IV (all ECM from Sigma) for 5 to 7
days.
Xenograft studies
Animal procedures were approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). A total of
105 to 106 cells were injected s.c. or 105 cells were injected
stereotactically into the right caudate (orthotopic model) of
5- to 8-week-old female athymic mice. Mice were randomized into treatment groups after tumors were established
(mean s.c. volume ¼ 40–60 mm3 or 10 days after intracranial
implantation). Bevacizumab and human immunoglobulin G
(IgG) control (Sigma) were administered at 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice weekly. Inhibitory anti-b1 integrin
mAb OS2966 or control IgG was administered at 1, 5, or 10
mg/kg i.p. twice weekly. For orthotopic studies, OS2966 or
IgG (160 mg total) was delivered intratumorally over 28 days
via rigid cannula connected to Model 1004 osmotic pumps
(Alzet) implanted s.c. between the scapulae. Subcutaneous
tumors were measured with calipers 1 to 2 times weekly,
with volume calculated as described (24). Treatment continued until mice had to be sacriﬁced per IACUC criteria
(e.g., 2.1-cm maximal dimension, cutaneous ulceration, or
symptoms) or study end.

(33). We showed nearly 80% more CA9 staining after bevacizumab resistance as compared with before, with areas of
CA9 staining corresponding with high b1 integrin expression
in patient glioblastoma specimens (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
To verify that antiangiogenic therapy acutely increases b1
integrin expression in growing tumors in vivo, we stained
glioblastoma tumors from mice taken within days of the last
bevacizumab treatment. Striking b1 integrin immunoreactivity was observed in the treated tumors compared with
controls, particularly in the hypoxic tumor core (Supplementary Fig. S3B). To conﬁrm this mechanism, we cultured
U87MG cells for 6 to 48 hours in 1% oxygen to simulate
microenvironmental hypoxia. We observed a signiﬁcant
increase in b1 integrin expression in glioma cells in vitro

(Supplementary Fig. S3C). This was a rapid and reversible
cellular response, which we also showed in primary human
glioblastoma cells and breast and colorectal carcinoma cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3D). Therefore it is likely that hypoxia
contributes to b1 integrin upregulation during bevacizumab
therapy, thus promoting mechanisms of survival and evasion.
b1 integrin inhibition attenuates mesenchymal
phenotype and function of BRG cells
To further establish a functional role for b1 integrin in the
malignant phenotype of bevacizumab glioblastoma cells,
we established several clones of the BRG3 line expressing
shRNA-targeting b1 integrin (shBETA1) and shRNA-targeting
control sequences (shCTRL; Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4D). An

epithelioid morphologic shift, including polygonal shape and
tendency for growth in sheets, was observed in the shBETA1
clones compared with shCTRL cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A).
Indeed, individual cell size as measured by cell area was
signiﬁcantly increased in the shBETA1 clones compared with
shCTRL (Supplementary Fig. S5B). In addition, dendricity
factor, a unitless measure of cell shape, conﬁrmed mesenchymal morphology in the shCTRL cells compared with more
epithelioid morphology in the shBETA1 clones (Supplementary Fig. S5C). To verify functional impairment of mesenchymal
phenotype, we examined the knockdown cells in various static
and dynamic in vitro assays. As hypothesized, BRG3-shBETA1
clones showed signiﬁcantly decreased capacity for mesenchymal functions, including adhesion (Fig. 2A), cell spreading (Fig.
2B and C and Supplementary Movie S1), and migration (Fig. 2D
and E and Supplementary Movie S2) on ECM compared with
BRG3-shCTRL cells. Furthermore, bevacizumab-na€ve cells
showed epithelial-like migration with broad lamellipodia (Supplementary Movie S3) in contrast with the saltatory mesenchymal-type migration seen in the BRG3 line. In addition,
in vitro proliferation (Fig. 2F) was signiﬁcantly attenuated in

the BRG3-shBETA1 clones compared with BRG3-shCTRL cells.
This effect of b1 integrin knockdown in the BRG3 line on cell
growth in vitro was determined to be cytostatic, rather than
cytotoxic (Supplementary Fig. S5D). Similar results on adhesion, migration, and proliferation were found when the BRG3
line was treated with the inhibitory b1 integrin mAb, OS2966
(Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B and Supplementary Movie
S4). Thus, b1 integrin is important for multiple tumor cell
functions implicated in antiangiogenic therapy evasion, including persistent proliferation and mesenchymal phenotype.
Spheroidal growth is impaired by b1 integrin inhibition
Microenvironmental hypoxia (34) and acidiﬁcation (29) are
2 suspected consequences of antiangiogenic therapy, and both
activate HIF-1a and HIF-2a expression. Both hypoxia-associated factors have also been linked to malignant stem-like
phenotypes in glioblastoma cells including in vitro spheroid
formation. Indeed, freshly isolated bevacizumab-resistant
U87-BEV cells are more highly prone to spheroid formation
in vitro compared with the control U87-IGG line under normal
culture conditions (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Implantation of

dissociated BRG1 and BRG3 glioblastoma cells in suspension
show the highest b1 integrin expression at cell–cell contacts
(Fig. 3A). Therefore, to investigate a potential role for b1
integrins in glioblastoma spheroid formation, we cultured
U87MG cells under acidic stress. Spheroid formation in acidic
media was attenuated in U87-shBETA1 (Supplementary Fig.
S7B) cells compared with control U87-shCONTROL cells
(Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained with parental U87MG
cells treated with an inhibitory b1 integrin antibody (Supplementary Fig. S7C). To more directly study spheroid formation,
we grew glioblastoma cells in suspension in nonadherent plates.
U87 cells with stable knockdown of b1 integrin (U87-shBETA1)
showed signiﬁcantly smaller spheroid diameters than control
U87-shCONTROL cells (Fig. 3C). The same result was found in
knockdown clones from the clinically derived BRG3 line (Fig.
3D). Furthermore, conﬁrming the role of b1 integrins in spheroidal maintenance, we showed dissolution of glioblastoma
spheroids when plated on classic b1 integrin ECM substrates,
particularly ﬁbronectin (Fig. 3E). Thus, the b1 integrin subunit is
intimately involved in cell–cell interactions and malignant
spheroidal growth in glioma cells in vitro, a phenotype that
has been associated with increased malignancy in vivo.

b1 integrin inhibition prevents BRG growth in vivo
To test the role of b1 integrin in glioma growth and bevacizumab resistance in vivo, we used several glioma cell models
in athymic mice. First, we showed attenuation of tumor growth
in the BRG2 and BRG3 lines after stable knockdown of b1
integrin (polyclonal, approximately 70% knockdown). In both
cases, tumor growth was signiﬁcantly impaired in the shBETA1
cells compared with shCTRL cells (Fig. 4A and B). We then
inoculated mice with clones of BRG3 that had more than 90%
knockdown of b1 integrin. Consistent with a gene–dosage
effect, we showed complete prevention of in vivo tumor growth
for 6 months (Fig. 4C). Thus, b1 integrin inhibition overcomes
growth of both BNG and BRG cells in vivo.
To provide proof-of-concept for a clinically relevant treatment modality, we tested a therapeutic antibody approach in a
glioma xenograft model. Mice inoculated with the BRG3 cell
line were systemically treated with inhibitory b1 integrin
monoclonal antibodies (OS2966) at 2 doses. Both groups of
treated mice had signiﬁcantly smaller tumors than mice
treated with 5 mg/kg of control IgG (Fig. 4D and E). Strikingly,
56% (5/9) of mice with BRG3 tumors treated with 5 mg/kg
OS2966 showed complete tumor regression after 8 weeks of
treatment. We observed apoptosis on histology in the treated
group but not in the IgG control (Fig. 4F). Finally, to verify the
above ﬁndings in an orthotopic model, we stereotactically
implanted BRG3 cells into the striatum of mice. Ten days after
inoculation, we implanted cannulae through the same burr
hole for chronic intratumoral delivery of either OS2966 or IgG
control via s.c. osmotic pumps that provided antibody delivery
for 28 days. Successful tumoral delivery of antibodies was
veriﬁed with immunoﬂuorescence detection of OS2966 in
horizontal brain sections (Supplementary Fig. S8). BRG3 cells
in the control condition formed highly invasive tumors, and
55.2%  11% of invading cells were associated with the
neurovasculature according to GLUT-1 immunoreactivity for

endothelial cells (Fig. 5A). OS2966 treatment resulted in complete regression of tumors (3/3 mice) as supported by massive
induction of tumor cell apoptosis on TUNEL staining (Fig. 5B).
Finally, OS2966 treatment inhibited striatal invasion as shown
by number of invading cells per section (Fig. 5C) and invasion
distance (Fig. 5D). Accordingly, OS2966 treatment seemed to
directly affect invasive morphology of tumor cells (Fig. 5E).
Thus, blockade of b1 integrin function with inhibitory monoclonal antibodies attenuates growth of a recurrent bevacizumab-resistant glioma line in vivo.
b1 integrin inhibition potentiates bevacizumab
treatment
Not all patients respond to bevacizumab, and signiﬁcant
morbidity is associated with its long-term use. Therefore, there
is clinical need for a novel therapeutic approach to improve
response rates, prevent resistance, and potentially reduce the
necessary dose of bevacizumab. Toward this end, full-dose
combination therapy of OS2966 with bevacizumab was

www.aacrjournals.org

attempted in the U87MG subcutaneous xenograft model in
2 separate investigations. However, both studies had to be
halted before their endpoints due to rapid cutaneous tumor
ulceration in 100% (5/5 and 10/10 mice, respectively) of the
combination therapy animals by the third week of treatment.
These ﬁndings are suggestive of synergy between OS2966 and
bevacizumab. To explore this question further, we hypothesized that the addition of OS2966 alternating with low-dose
bevacizumab would enhance efﬁcacy in U87MG xenografts
(Fig. 6A). Indeed, alternating OS2966 and bevacizumab at
1 mg/kg, each was equivalent to a biweekly standard dose of
bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) in this setting (Fig. 6B). Furthermore,
the percentage of animals with complete regression of tumors
was nearly equivalent, with 44% (4/9) of mice in the alternating
low-dose group compared with 56% (5/9) of mice in the
standard dose group. Thus, consistent with its multiple roles
in promoting therapeutic resistance, b1 integrin is potentially a
promising adjunct target in combination with antiangiogenic
therapies, including bevacizumab.

Discussion
Our data show for the ﬁrst time that resistance to antiangiogenic therapy is associated with increased expression of
b1 integrin as well as increased mobility of b1 integrin and
increased turnover of b1 integrin in focal adhesions. We also
showed that resistance to antiangiogenic therapy can be
overcome by targeting tumor cell interactions with the glioma
microenvironment via b1 integrin inhibition. In contrast to
approaches that target a speciﬁc integrin–ligand interaction
(e.g., natalizumab, which targets a4 integrin, blocking the
ability of a4b1 or a4b7 to bind VCAM-1), a single drug
targeting b1 would inhibit the ability of tumor cells to bind
a spectrum of ECM ligands like ﬁbronectin, collagen IV, and
laminin, each of which we found to be upregulated in BRGs
(22). This approach could potentially be applied more broadly
in several medical indications. Inhibition of b1 integrin overcomes resistance to antiangiogenesis therapy via multiple
potential mechanisms: (i) preventing vessel cooption (and/or
growth/invasion upon any classical ECM substrate; ref. 21); (ii)
reducing viability of tumor cells after insults (35); (ii) directly
inhibiting tumor cell proliferation; (iii) directly inhibiting the
vascularization process (36); and (iv) inhibiting the aggressive

mesenchymal phenotype, including spheroidal growth. In
addition, b1 integrin inhibition alternating with bevacizumab
can reduce the necessary dose of antiangiogenic agent, thus
potentially reducing drug-related morbidity.
It is tempting to speculate that because breast and other
cancer cells also respond to insults with an increase in b1
integrin expression (e.g., Supplementary Fig. S3D), this
approach may be applicable for the treatment of a wide variety
of high-grade and/or treatment-refractory adenocarcinomas.
This hypothesis warrants further study. Indeed, b1 integrin has
proved to be a viable oncological target in animal models of
solid and blood-borne cancers for multiple processes, including (i) prevention and growth of metastasis (37); (ii) overcoming resistance to radiation (35) and chemotherapy (38–42); and
(iii) inhibition of local carcinoma spread. In addition, b1
integrin upregulation has been shown to be prognostic for
breast (38, 43), lung (44), and pancreatic (37) cancers.
A limitation of the current study is the inability to directly
study the effect of antiangiogenesis mechanistically in vitro.
Bevacizumab acts at the endothelium, causing ischemia and
other tissue-level processes, which cannot be accurately modeled with isolated tumor cells or cocultures. Therefore, the

b1 Integrin Drives Antiangiogenic Therapy Resistance

spectrum of adaptations to antiangiogenic therapy cannot
currently be reliably assessed in vitro. We have addressed this
limitation with a multimodal approach using clinical specimens and their cellular derivatives in surrogate in vitro assays
(e.g., hypoxia, acidiﬁed media) and relevant preclinical murine
models. Of note, these murine models were generated by
treating tumors with bevacizumab, which targets human, not
murine VEGF, and would therefore target only tumor cells
rather than stromal cells. However, we have found that bevacizumab is equally effective in xenograft treatment as an
agent-targeting mouse and human VEGF (personal communication, C. David James, Department of Neurological Surgery,
University of California, San Francisco, CA; 2008).
The orthotopic model with bevacizumab-resistant BRG3
cells revealed several important ﬁndings. First, we conﬁrmed
that parenchymal invasion of bevacizumab-resistant glioma
cells occurs primarily via vessel cooption. Second, OS2966
delivered via osmotic pump nearly completely abolished invasion of BRG3 cells. In addition, inhibition of b1 integrin in these
studies resulted in tumor cell apoptosis and disrupted tumor
mass formation. Because of the ﬁnite life of the osmotic pumps,
survival studies were not possible; however, the results provide
solid proof-of-concept for intracranial delivery of OS2966 as a
treatment for BRG via modalities like convection-enhanced

delivery, which would enable more high-ﬂow intratumoral
infusion of OS2966 (45). Although local delivery of b1 integrin-targeted therapy would be appealing by increasing local
concentrations of the therapeutic agent and minimizing systemic exposure, it should be noted that an antibody targeting
b1 integrin was nontoxic when systemically delivered in our
studies and other studies (35).
Although we have shown that alternating low doses of b1
integrin inhibition with bevacizumab can reduce the necessary
weekly dose of bevacizumab by 20 times and can inhibit growth
of bevacizumab-resistant glioma cells, the question remains
whether alternate or combination therapy can attenuate development of resistance to bevacizumab over longer treatment
periods. To deﬁne the full potential of our approach in the clinic
will require exploring various dosing schedules and combinations in vivo. Still, our data suggest that b1 integrin inhibition as
monotherapy for BRG or combined with bevacizumab to reduce
the risk of resistance are promising therapeutic strategies.
