Mitochondrial Sirtuins in Cancer: Emerging Roles
and Therapeutic Potential
Jasmine George1 and Nihal Ahmad1,2

Abstract
The past few decades have witnessed a furious attention of
scientiﬁc community toward identifying novel molecular factors
and targets that could be exploited for drug development for
cancer management. One such factor is the sirtuin (SIRT) family of
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADþ)-dependent deacetylases. The role of SIRTs in cancer is extremely complex, with
dichotomous functions depending on cell contexts. Mammalian
SIRTs (SIRT1–7) differ in their cellular localization and biologic
functions. Among these, SIRT -3, -4, and -5 are located in the
mitochondria and are being carefully investigated. These mitochondrial SIRTs (mtSIRT) regulate multiple cellular and physio-

logic processes, including cell cycle, gene expression, cell viability,
stress response, metabolism, and energy homeostasis. Recent
research suggests that mtSIRTs inﬂuence tumors by regulating
the metabolic state of the cell. Although the research on the role of
mtSIRTs in cancer is still in its infancy, studies have suggested
tumor suppressor as well as tumor promoter roles for them. This
review is focused on discussing up-to-date information about the
roles and functional relevance of mtSIRTs (SIRT -3, -4, -5) in
cancers. We have also provided a critical discussion and our
perspective on their dual roles, as tumor promoter versus tumor
suppressor, in cancer. Cancer Res; 76(9); 2500–6. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

The SIRT family of proteins is becoming increasingly interesting
and important due to the seemingly dichotomous role of this
enzyme family in cancer biology, with both tumor promoter and
tumor suppressor functions suggested in different cancers. In this
review, we have focused on the role of mitochondrial sirtuins
(mtSIRT) in cancer. Indeed, mitochondrial cell signaling is
extremely critical for cancer cells to grow and proliferate; and
metabolic imbalances and enhanced resistance to mitochondrial
apoptosis are well-established hallmarks of cancer cells.

Cancer is a cluster of diseases with an underlying common
feature of the development of abnormal cells that propagate outof-control to travel and target almost every organ of the body to
make it dysfunctional. According to American Cancer Society, it is
expected that, the global cancer burden will nearly double by
2030, with 21.4 million cases and 13.2 million deaths (1). The last
few decades have seen tremendous progress toward identifying
the genes and pathways in cancer development and progression.
The members of the Sir2 (silent information regulator 2) family,
or sirtuins, have been widely investigated for their role in a variety
of biologic processes and disease conditions.
The sirtuins (SIRT) belong to a family of class III histone
deacetylases (HDAC) enzymes, which are highly conserved
enzyme homologs of the yeast Sir2 protein, with nicotine adenine
dinucleotide NADþ-dependent protein deacetylases and/or
mono ADP ribosyltransferase activities (2). They are also known
for regulating posttranslational acyl modiﬁcations in organisms
ranging from bacteria to human (3, 4). Mammalian SIRTs make
up a superfamily of seven SIRTs (SIRT1–SIRT7). Among these,
SIRT1 is predominantly nuclear and SIRT2 is localized mainly in
cytoplasm. However, they have the ability to shuttle between the
nucleus and cytoplasm. SIRT3, SIRT4, and SIRT5 are primarily
mitochondrial proteins, whereas SIRT6 and SIRT7 are nuclear
sirtuins (5).

Discovery of Sirtuin Family of Enzymes:
An Important Class of HDACs
The founding member of sirtuin family, Sir2, was ﬁrst discovered as regulators of aging in the budding yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. In the late 1990s, a study led by Matt Kaeberlein veriﬁed
that Sir2 overexpression prolongs yeast lifespan and deletion of
Sir2 reduces yeast lifespan (6). However, a study by Imai and
Guarente showed, for the ﬁrst time, the true enzymatic activity of
Sir2, as a NADþ-dependent histone deacetylase and gave a possible description of the mechanism by which Sir2 controls yeast
aging (7). The evolutionarily conserved orthologs of Sir2 are
shown to be found in most forms of life, including eukaryotes
and prokaryotes (8). Structurally, the sirtuins members (SIRT1–
SIRT7) share a conserved catalytic core of approximately 275
amino acids that is ﬂanked by N- and C-terminal sequences
of variable length. A small zinc-binding domain and a large
Rossmann-fold domain endow all SIRTs with the speciﬁcity to
bind NADþ as a cofactor. SIRTs enzymatic activities have been
linked to a variety of cellular processes such as stress response,
differentiation, metabolism, apoptosis, and cell survival due to
their ability to deacetylate both histone and numerous nonhistone targets (9). Although SIRTs have been studied for over
a decade, the scientiﬁc community is still struggling to establish
their complex role in cancer.

Mitochondrial SIRTs in Cancer

Mitochondrial SIRTs: The Master
Regulators of Metabolic Homeostasis
As aforementioned, there are three known mtSIRTs (SIRT -3, -4,
-5) shown to regulate a variety of cellular processes. SIRT3, a
45 kDa protein, is located on chromosome 11p15.5 having an
N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence that is cleaved off
after import into the mitochondria, leaving an enzymatically
active 28 kDa protein. SIRT4 is 35.2 kDa protein located on
chromosome 12q24.31, whereas SIRT5 (33.9 kDa)-like pseudogene is present on chromosome 1p31.2-32.1 (8). Most of their
functions are recently reviewed by Shih and colleagues (10).
SIRT3 has a strong deacetylase activity, whereas SIRT4 has ADP
ribosyltransferase activity, lipoamidase and biotinidase activities
in mitochondria (11). SIRT5 has protein lysine desuccinylase,
demalonylase, deglutarylase, and weak deacetylase activities. In
addition, SIRT5 deacetylates carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1
(CPS1), an enzyme catalyzing the initial step of the urea cycle for
ammonia detoxiﬁcation and disposal (12). All these three SIRTs
are metabolically active in tissues like kidney, liver, adipose, heart,
and brain.
The important role of mtSIRTs in cancer is not surprising owing
to the fact that the process of cancer development and progression
involves major alterations in cellular metabolism and mitochondrial energetics. Moreover, cancer cells are metabolically active
and consume more cellular fuel than normal cells (13). Otto
Warburg ﬁrst proposed the theory in 1920s that defects in energy
metabolism, particularly in mitochondrial function, may be the
root cause of cancer. The proposed "Warburg effect" suggests that
cancer cells prefer glycolytic breakdown of glucose for energy,
rather than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (14). Mitochondria is considered as the energy provider and regulate various
homeostatic processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and calcium homeostasis. Understanding the
mechanisms that link cellular energy metabolism and regulation
of gene expression is of fundamental importance that could
potentially be exploited for the management of various diseases,
including cancer. The mtSIRTs are critical for the maintenance of
cellular and mitochondria homeostasis through regulating mitochondria metabolism and protecting cells against oxidative stress
via regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, a critical
mechanism in cancer. Utilizing the mitochondrial NAD pool, the
mtSIRTs can deacetylate targets implicated in the regulation of
both glycolysis and cellular oxidative stress.
A more detailed discussion of mtSIRTs, including SIRT5, is
elegantly provided in a very recent article by Kumar and Lombard
(15). A brief account of mtSIRTs and their biologic functions,
especially relevant to cancer pathophysiology, is provided below.
SIRT3
SIRT3 is most well characterized and studied mtSIRT that has
been shown to regulate almost every major aspect of mitochondrial biology (16–18). Not surprisingly, SIRT3 is reported
to contribute to the age-related diseases, metabolic, cardiovascular, neurogenerative diseases, and cancer (19). SIRT3 deacetylates key mitochondrial proteins, including acetyl-coenzyme
A synthetase 2, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH; refs. 20, 21). Recently, SIRT3 is
found to deacetylate and increase pyruvate dehydrogenase
activity in cancer cells, which can increase both mitochondrial
bioenergetics and glycolysis (22). Furthermore, SIRT3 binds to

www.aacrjournals.org

and deacetylates mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) to
promote its function, thereby inhibiting colon cancer cell
growth (23). SIRT3 functions as a downstream target of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1
alpha (PGC-1a) and decreases cellular ROS production and
stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis (17). Indeed, PGC-1a, a
transcriptional coactivator of genes involved in energy homeostasis, including PPARs, estrogen-related receptor (ERR), and
nuclear respiratory factors (Nrfs), is a master regulator of
metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis.
A key metabolic enzyme that is directly regulated by SIRT3 in
mitochondria is manganese superoxide (MnSOD) that protects
the cells by detoxifying ROS (24). SIRT3 promotes antioxidant
activity of MnSOD via direct deacetylation, and loss of SIRT3
increases acetylation of MnSOD to enhance ROS, which stabilizes
hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1a), thereby facilitating
tumor development (25). Conversely, Cui and colleagues found
that overexpression of SIRT3 increases lactate production, ATP
production leading to increased glycolysis, which together with
increased MnSOD activity, decreased ROS level to promoted cell
proliferation of gastric cancer cells (26). In glioma cells, SIRT3
maintains the mitochondrial DNA integrity through its ability to
deacetylate 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1), thus preventing apoptosis and promoting carcinogenesis (27). Also,
SIRT3 has been recently shown to deacetylate glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT2) that regulates the malate-aspartate
NADH shuttle to control the growth of pancreatic tumor (28).
Mitochondrial impairment and ROS production have been implicated in the development of insulin resistance and linked with
diabetes. Consistent with this framework, decreased level of SIRT3
along with its associated transcription factor, forkhead box O3
(FOXO3a) was observed in mouse 3T3L1 adipocytes and C2C12
myotubes upon chronic arsenic exposure (29). This decrease in
SIRT3 caused enhanced ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane damage, leading to insulin resistance (29). Another study
shows SIRT3-deﬁcient mice when fed a chronic high-fat diet
showed accelerated obesity, insulin resistance, and steatohepatitis
compared with wild-type mice (30).
SIRT4
SIRT4 has also been shown to regulate cellular metabolism
by a variety of mechanisms. Glutamine metabolism is important for mitochondrial functions and macromolecular synthesis
and could play an important role in cancer progression. SIRT4
has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor by regulating
glutamine metabolism, suggesting a potential therapeutic use
in glutamine-dependent neoplasms, such as B-cell lymphoma
(31). In addition, C-terminal–binding protein (CtBP)-mediated suppression of SIRT4 and enzymatic modiﬁcation of GDH
has been shown to promote glutaminolysis, in breast cancer
cells (32). Also, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) promotes mitochondrial glutamine metabolism by stimulating GDH and
repressing the transcription of SIRT4 regulator cAMP-responsive element binding 2 (CREB2), and SIRT4 overexpression
reduces proliferation and transformation of tuberous sclerosis
2 mutant cells and tumor development in a xenograft model
(33). Besides, SIRT4 has also been implicated in other mitochondrial dysfunction–related disorders like insulin secretion,
obesity, and cardiovascular diseases (34–36). Therefore, on the
basis of published studies, SIRT4 appears to have a tumor
suppressor function.

SIRT5
Phylogenetically most closely related to prokaryotic sirtuins,
SIRT5 is predominantly mitochondrial, with some evidence of
existence of functional extra-mitochondrial protein. Limited
number of studies has examined the role of SIRT5 in cellular
metabolic functions. SIRT5-mediated lysine desuccinylation has
been shown to modulate a number of diverse metabolic pathways
(37). Probably, the ﬁrst clue suggesting the role of SIRT5 in
metabolism and cancer comes from the observation that SIRT5
desuccinylates SOD1 and eliminates ROS thereby inhibits lung
cancer cells growth (38). In addition, SIRT5-mediated deacetylation of FOXO3 is shown to play an essential role in protecting lung
epithelial cells from cigarette smoke extract–induced apoptosis
(39). As described in a very recent review, SIRT5 deacetylates,
desuccinylates, demalonylates, and/or deglutarylates multiple
metabolic enzymes to activate or inhibit a variety of metabolic/
cellular processes, including glucose oxidation, ketone body
formation, fatty acid oxidation, ammonia detoxiﬁcation, and
ROS management (15).

Mitochondrial SIRTs and Their Molecular
Targets: Relevance to Cancer
The research on mtSIRT's role in cancer and its downstream
targets has gained a lot of momentum in the recent years. A wide
variety of molecular targets are associated with the different
biologic functions modulated by SIRTs. Some of these important
targets are described below.
SIRT3
The fact that SIRT3 can regulate many hallmarks of the cancer
cells implicates SIRT3 as a potential therapeutic target for cancer
management (40). However, the role of SIRT3 in cancer is being
extensively debated, with numerous evidences supporting both
tumor promoter and suppressor roles for SIRT3. SIRT3 was
initially suggested to act as a tumor suppressor when introduction
of a single oncogene (Myc or Ras) into the mouse embryonic
ﬁbroblasts (MEF) from SIRT3-knockout mice resulted in an in
vitro transformation (41). Furthermore, Yang and colleagues
reported that SIRT3 was aberrantly downregulated in gastric
cancer tissue samples from patients (42). Recently, decreased
SIRT3 expression was found in mantle cell lymphoma tissues
and B-cell malignant cells. This SIRT3 loss was found to correlate
with hyperacetylation of IDH2 and SOD2, thereby decreasing
IDH2 and SOD2 activities in B-cell malignant cells (43). Another
study demonstrated that SIRT3 is decreased in gastric cancer cells
and its exogenous overexpression suppressed the proliferation of
gastric cancer cells by downregulating Notch-1 (44). SIRT3 deacetylates and destabilizes the proto-oncogene product S-phase
kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2), and inactivation of SIRT3
leads to Skp2 acetylation and increased stability and cytoplasmic
retention, causing enhanced cellular proliferation, migration, and
tumorigenesis (45). Song and colleagues demonstrated that
SIRT3 inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma growth via glycogen
synthase kinase-3b (GSK-3b)/Bax-dependent apoptotic pathway
(46). In addition, binding of SIRT3 with nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) was shown to regulate
cell proliferation and apoptosis in non–small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC) cell lines, implicating the interaction between SIRT3 and
NMNAT2, energy metabolism associated with SIRT3 (47). More
recently, depletion of SIRT3 was shown to exert tumor-suppres-

2502 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

sive function by regulating iron metabolism in pancreatic cancer
(48). Also, exogenous overexpression of SIRT3 was shown to
suppress prostate cancer by decreasing ROS generation that inhibits Akt phosphorylation at Ser 473, leading to ubiquitin-mediated proteosomal c-MYC degradation (49).
In certain cancers, SIRT3 is found to be overexpressed (50–52)
and associated with therapy resistance (53). Interestingly, both
tumor suppressor and oncogenic function of SIRT3 have been
reported in breast cancer (54, 55). Liu and colleagues have shown
a transcriptional activation of SIRT3 in several radiation-treated
human tumor cells and their corresponding xenograft tumors that
was mediated via NF-kB and Thr150/Ser159 phosphorylation by
cyclin B1-CDK1 (56). In another study, clinically, high cytoplasmic SIRT3 expression was shown to correlate with high tumor
grades, positive lymph node status, and poor prognosis in colon
cancer patients (57). Among 127 patients, high SIRT3 expression
was seen in 71 patients and low SIRT3 expression was seen in 56
patients. The overall survival rate was 80.2% among patients with
low SIRT3 expressions and 55.9% among patients with high
SIRT3 expressions (log rank P ¼ 0.002). However, the relevance
of cytoplasmic SIRT3 needs to be carefully investigated in future
studies. In a very recent study from our laboratory, we found that
SIRT3 is overexpressed in human melanoma cells and clinical
melanoma tissues (58). Furthermore, an shRNA-mediated knockdown of SIRT3 was found to impart signiﬁcant antiproliferative
effects in multiple human melanoma cell lines (58). Conversely,
forced exogenous overexpression of SIRT3 promoted enhanced
proliferative potential of Hs294T melanoma cells and normal
immortalized Mel-ST melanocytes (58). In addition, SIRT3
knockdown also resulted in a decrease in tumor growth in vivo
in a xenograft model (58). In addition, limited information is
available regarding mutation(s) in SIRT3 and its role in cancer.
Chen and colleagues have found that point mutation in SIRT3
reduced its deacetylase activity promoting proliferation of oral
squamous cell carcinoma cells (59). However, the exact role of
mutant SIRT3 in tumorigenesis needs to be further explored.
SIRT3 has been shown to target and deacetylate the lysine
residues of not only mitochondrial proteins, but also numerous
other proteins as well. An interaction between SIRT3 and tumor
suppressor p53 has been shown in certain cancers. SIRT3 was
shown to partially abrogate p53 activity to enact growth arrest and
senescence in bladder carcinoma (60). Similarly, an exogenous
overexpression of SIRT3 was found to inhibit HCC cell growth by
reducing mouse double minute 2 (MDM2)-mediated p53 degradation, possibly via posttranscriptional regulation (61). Interestingly, SIRT3 overexpression upregulated p53 and its downstream factor p21 and decreased ROS level in lung adenocarcinoma cells thereby imparting proproliferative response (62). In
cardiomyocytes, SIRT3 deacetylates Ku70, augmenting Ku70–Bax
interactions and consequently preventing Bax translocation to the
mitochondria, thus protecting these cells from genotoxic and
oxidative stress-mediated cell death to promote cell survival
(63). Thus, it appears that SIRT3 can have oncogenic or tumorsuppressive functions based on cancer types and both known and
possibly yet unidentiﬁed downstream targets.
SIRT4
Limited information is available regarding the downstream
targets of SIRT4 and its interactions with other pathways that
affect metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells. As discussed
above, a few reports articulate tumor-suppressive activities of

SIRT4 via its effects on mitochondrial glutamine metabolism, in
part through modiﬁcation and repression of GDH. In a recent
study, down regulation of SIRT4 has been shown to be associated
with poor prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) patients (64). Tumor suppressor function of SIRT4 is
also reported in colorectal cancer where SIRT4 has been shown to
cause E-cadherin upregulation thereby suppressing the proliferation, migration, and invasion through inhibition of glutamine
metabolism (65). Jeong and colleagues have shown that SIRT4
loss causes increased glutamine-dependent proliferation and
stress-induced genomic instability, and SIRT4 knockout mice
spontaneously develop lung tumors (66). Huang and colleagues
have found a downregulation of SIRT4 in gastric adenocarcinoma,
suggesting its tumor suppressor function (67). Thus, SIRT4 loss or
inactivation seems to create a tumor-permissive environment to
provide metabolic advantage, supporting cell proliferation.
SIRT5
Like SIRT4, SIRT5 is also not extensively studied and characterized, especially in context with cancer. SIRT5 has been found to
be overexpressed in human NSCLC and can facilitate drug resistance in in vitro and in vivo by reducing expression of Nrf2 and its
downstream targets (68). Poletta and colleagues have shown
SIRT5 regulation of ammonia-induced autophagy and mitophagy
in breast cancer cells (69). Unlike in NSCLC, SIRT5 has been
shown to be considerably downregulated in HNSCC tissues
compared with noncancerous tissues, suggesting its possible
tumor suppressor function (70). Guan and colleagues have identiﬁed SIRT5 as a deacetylases for the tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), suggesting a tumor suppressor
function for this SIRT (71).
Thus, SIRT3 and SIRT5 have been shown to exhibit tumor
suppressor as well as tumor promoter properties under different
cellular conditions, tumor stage and tissue of origin. Interestingly,
on the basis of limited number of studies, SIRT4 appears to have
only a tumor suppressor function. However, further detailed
studies are needed to dissect the downstream targets of mtSIRTs.

Activators and Inhibitors of Mitochondrial
SIRTs: Potential Uses in Cancer Therapy
Recent research has established the essential roles of mtSIRTs in
a wide range of critical mitochondrial functions and cellular
processes. This has spurred extensive research and efforts from
scientists across multiple disciplines toward the development of
small-molecule modulators (activators and inhibitors) of these
SIRTs. Although considerable efforts have been made to develop
sirtuin inhibitors and activators (reviewed in refs. 72, 73) in the
recent past, only limited success has been achieved. Majority of the
known modulators of sirtuins seem to suffer from speciﬁcity
issues. To our knowledge, no speciﬁc modulators of mtSIRTs
have been reported. Thus, this area of research is still in infancy
and needs a concerted attention from scientists and drug
companies. Table 1 provides a list of recently identiﬁed and
characterized mtSIRT-modulators together with their IC50 values.

Concluding Discussion and Perspective
Mitochondrial SIRTs are critical regulators of metabolic functions in the cells, which are responsible for keeping the cellular
homeostasis and cellular energetics "in check." Emerging evidence
is now suggesting that mtSIRTs are important regulator of what is
known as "oncometabolism," deﬁned as the ensemble of metabolic rearrangements that accompany oncogenesis and tumor
progression (74). Increasing understanding of the function of
mtSIRTs is providing an insight on their functional signiﬁcance in
cancer. The mtSIRTs have been shown to target a variety of
metabolic substrates that are relevant to pathophysiology of
cancer. A description of the key metabolic substrates of mtSIRTs,
their biologic functions, downstream targets, and expression
pattern in cancer is provided in Table 2. It seems possible that
the SIRTs may be useful as novel biomarkers for cancer diagnoses
and targets for development of novel strategies for cancer therapy.
However, further research is needed to answer the question, why
and how these sirtuins have both oncogenic or tumor-suppressive

role, in different cancer and how this dual action could be best
exploited in cancer management? It seems probable that the role
of sirtuins is different in cancer cells versus normal cells and/or
depends on the stage of neoplastic transformation. Future
research needs to address these possibilities. As discussed above,
there is a need to intensify our efforts toward the development of
novel speciﬁc pharmacologic activators and inhibitors of SIRTs
that can serve as a tool to understand the sirtuin biology and may
also possibly be useful in the management of diseases where SIRTs
are dysregulated, including cancer. However, given the important
role of mtSIRTs in metabolism, there is always an issue of offtarget complications. This needs to be carefully investigated.
Furthermore, there may be some cancers where more than one
sirtuins are overexpressed (or downregulated). In these cases, the
nonspeciﬁc broad sirtuin inhibitors may be more useful, rather
than speciﬁc ones. On the same line, additional research is
required to ascertain the functional redundancy and overlaps

among different sirtuins. This is particularly important for the
mtSIRTs. In conclusion, the mtSIRTs have emerged as critical
regulators of diverse metabolic functions relevant to cancer.
Therefore, manipulating these enzymes may have important
implications in cancer management.
