BACKGROUND: Each year in the United States, nearly 50,000 prostate cancer patients exhibit a rise in prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) levels, which can indicate disease recurrence. For patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, we evaluated the
effects of white button mushroom (WBM) powder on serum PSA levels and determined the tolerability and biological activity of
WBM. METHODS: Patients with continuously rising PSA levels were enrolled in the study. Dose escalation was conducted in cohorts
of 6; this ensured that no more than 1 patient per cohort experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The primary objective was to
evaluate treatment feasibility and associated toxicity. The secondary objectives were to determine WBM’s effect on serum PSA/
androgen levels; myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs); and cytokine levels. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were treated; no DLTs
were encountered. The overall PSA response rate was 11%. Two patients receiving 8 and 14 g/d demonstrated complete response
(CR): their PSA declined to undetectable levels that continued for 49 and 30 months. Two patients who received 8 and 12 g/d experienced partial response (PR). After 3 months of therapy, 13 (36%) patients experienced some PSA decrease below baseline. Patients
with CR and PR demonstrated higher levels of baseline interleukin-15 than nonresponders; for this group, we observed therapyassociated declines in MDSCs. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with WBM appears to both impact PSA levels and modulate the biology of

INTRODUCTION
Adenocarcinoma of the prostate causes a significant number of cancer-related deaths in men. This year, an estimated
238,590 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 29,720 men will die from the disease.1 In the past 2 decades,
testing of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has markedly increased diagnoses of organ-confined prostate cancer.2 As a
consequence, many men with newly diagnosed disease are treated (with a curative intent) using either radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy. The initial disease stage, PSA level, and Gleason score all influence the rates of recurrence.
Within 10 to 15 years of radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy, approximately 25% to 30% of men will demonstrate
disease recurrence.3 Clinical disease recurrence is usually presaged by elevated PSA levels; the vast majority of patients who
relapse initially have no radiographic evidence of metastatic disease. The definition of PSA relapse varies depending on
specific local therapy. Following prostatectomy, PSA is expected to be undetectable within 30 days of surgery.

Mushroom Therapy in Recurrent Prostate Cancer/Twardowski et al

Consequently, even a small elevation in PSA level (0.2
ng/mL) is considered a sign of persistent disease, and
small levels are associated with subsequent disease progression.3 Conversely, after primary radiation therapy,
PSA frequently remains detectable, reflecting the presence
of residual prostatic tissue. Thus, recurrence after radiation is frequently defined as an increase of PSA by >2.0
ng/mL above nadir.3 While the natural history of this
cohort of patients is variable, it is generally characterized
by a protracted clinical course.2,4,5 In these patients, the
risk of developing metastatic disease depends on several
factors: time to initial biochemical recurrence (2 vs  2
years), PSA doubling time (<10 or 10 months), and
pathologic Gleason’s score.2 Patients who have received
only 1 type of local therapy can be cured occasionally with
another local modality (radiation or surgery).6,7 However,
patients who received both types of local therapies yet
continue to experience an increase in PSA levels are considered incurable.
In this setting, the primary treatment option is
androgen deprivation therapy. This approach is highly
effective in suppressing prostate cancer; however, the side
effects are potentially significant and include fatigue,
weight gain, muscle weakness, hot flashes, erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, increased risk of diabetes, and cardiovascular problems.8 In the context of an otherwise
asymptomatic individual, such effects are especially concerning, because treatment is applied frequently for many
years. Furthermore, androgen deprivation therapy is not
curative.9 In PSA-recurrent disease, the ability of androgen deprivation to enhance patient outcomes (especially
overall survival) is unclear. Thus, in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, the optimal treatment approach
remains undefined, and new therapies with minimal toxicities need to be evaluated for this population. An ideal
therapy would be outpatient, orally administered, and
have minimal systemic toxicity; these properties facilitate
long-term, repeated administration.
According to epidemiologic and basic science evidence, plant-derived phytochemicals may play a significant role in prostate cancer prevention, risk of
recurrence, and therapy.10 For cancer patients with limited therapeutic options, such phytochemicals may represent a source of alternative treatment. Reports on
pomegranate juice,11 modified citrus pectin,12 lycopene,
and isoflavone13,14 have demonstrated that these materials have a modest, favorable effect on PSA kinetics. These
studies should be interpreted with caution, however; a
control arm was absent in each study, hence the clinical
significance of the endpoints is uncertain. Nevertheless,

for centuries in Asia, a wide variety of plants have been
used for medicinal purposes. In particular, several mushroom species have been shown to exhibit anticancer
effects; these include inhibiting cell proliferation in prostate,15-17 colon,18 and breast cancer cell lines.15,19 As
suggested by these and other studies, further investigation is warranted into both specific mushroom species
and pharmacologically active components of mushroom
species.
White button mushroom (WBM, Agaricus bisporus)
is the most common edible mushroom in the United
States. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that WBM
has beneficial effects on various kinds of cancers. Lectins
isolated from WBM increase the sensitivity of lung, colon,
and glioblastoma cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
drugs.20 In addition, WBM lectins inhibit colon cancer
cell proliferation20 and enhance cellular antioxidant
defense mechanisms.21 As we have demonstrated previously, by inhibiting aromatase activity, both total WBM
extract and certain isolated fractions effectively decrease
breast cancer cell proliferation.22 In these active WBM
fractions, conjugated linoleic acid was an important component; it was an inhibitor of both breast cell proliferation
and aromatase activity.22,23 In addition to breast cancer
cells, we evaluated the effect of WBM on prostate cancer
cell lines in vitro and in vivo. According to our results, in
all prostate cancer cell lines, WBM extract significantly
inhibits cell proliferation; this inhibition occurs through
induction of apoptosis of cancer cells.24 In mice gavaged
with mushroom extract, tumor size and cell proliferation
decreased, whereas apoptosis increased. Similarly, for
mushroom-fed mice, microarray analysis of tumors identified significant changes in gene expression. Particularly
altered were the gene networks involved in cell death;
growth and proliferation; lipid metabolism; the tricarboxylic acid cycle; and immune response.22,23
Based on these preclinical data and a clinical unmet
need, we conducted a single-institution phase 1 trial of
WBM powder in patients with biochemically recurrent
prostate cancer. The primary objective of the trial was to
evaluate the feasibility, toxicity, and biological activity of
prolonged therapy with WBM powder. All patients enrolled for this trial had (before enrollment) continuously
rising PSA levels after previously undergoing definitive
local therapy with prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or
both. Following the intake of WBM by biochemically
recurrent prostate cancer patients, correlative serum samples were collected to attempt to answer the question,
“What are the biological differences between PSA responders and nonresponders?”

TABLE 1. Patient Characteristics (n 5 36)

Patient Eligibility

Characteristic

A histologically or cytologically confirmed history of adenocarcinoma of the prostate was required for all patients.
Any number of local therapies was allowed. Patients had
to experience the following PSA failure: a PSA level of
0.2 ng/mL that increased above nadir after prostatectomy. If no prostatectomy was performed, and radiation
or other local therapies were used as a primary therapy,
patients had to experience a PSA increase of 2.0 ng/mL
above post-therapy nadir. The increase in PSA values had
to be established by at least 2 consecutive measurements
(each separated by at least 2 weeks). No clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease was allowed. In
conjunction with their prior primary definitive therapy,
patients were permitted to receive up to 9 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant hormone ablation. Androgen deprivation had to be completed at least 6 months prior to
registration, and testosterone levels had to be in the noncastrated level defined as >50 ng/dL. No complementary
or alternative therapy (eg, St. John’s Wort, PC-SPES, or
other herbal remedies taken for the purpose of treating
prostate cancer) could be given during protocol treatment. For patients who received neoadjuvant and/or
adjuvant chemotherapy, such treatments must have
been completed at least 6 months prior to protocol
registration.
Patients were enrolled between January 2009 and
September 2011. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00779168) and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments.
The study protocol was approved by the City of Hope
Institutional Review Board and the Institutional Scientific
Peer Review Committee of the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center. All patients provided written
informed consent before participation.
Patient Characteristics

Thirty-six patients were enrolled in the study; the demographic characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The
median patient age was 68 years (range, 53-80 years). The
median PSA level at the onset of therapy was 1.9 ng/mL
(range, 0.2-22.2 ng/mL). For all patients, the median
baseline testosterone level was 295.3 ng/dL (range,
86.0-833.7 ng/dL). All patients had prior radiation therapy, the majority of which took place in the postprostatectomy salvage setting. Thirty-three patients
(92%) underwent prior prostatectomy. Eleven patients
(30%) underwent earlier hormonal therapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting.

Preparation of Mushroom Tablets

See Supporting Information for details regarding the
preparation of the mushroom tablets.
Mushroom Tablet Treatment

The mushroom tablets were taken twice daily until PSA
progression, clinical progression, or toxicity. Twentyeight days constituted 1 treatment cycle. Dose escalation
was conducted in cohorts of 6 patients each at 6 dosages:
4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14 g/d. If no dose-limiting toxicities
(DLT) were encountered for a cohort of patients during
the first 28 days of treatment, the next highest dosage was
tested (up to 14 g/d). Approximately 90% of fresh WBM
weight consists of water; therefore, 4- to 14-g mushroom
tablets are equivalent to 40 to 140 g of fresh WBM.
Rationale for Dose Selection

Our trial examined 6 dosages beginning with 4 g/d. The
maximum dosage was capped at 14 g/d (ie, 28 tablets
daily). For chronic ingestion, this was thought to be the
highest practical dosage. We did not attempt to reach the
maximum tolerated dosage (MTD) because our preclinical data did not indicate a dose-dependent effect.
Efficacy and Safety Evaluation

Patients were evaluated clinically and with laboratory tests
every 28 days while on treatment. At every visit, medication lists including vitamins and supplements were
updated. A mushroom tablet pill count was performed at
every visit to verify compliance. Toxicity assessment was
performed in all patients who began therapy using the
NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE version 3.0). DLT applied only to cycle 1 and
had to be drug-related (possible, probable, or definite).
Any grade 2 or greater toxicity (excluding allergic rhinitis,
Cancer

fatigue, sweating, weight gain or loss, alopecia, dry skin,
nail or pigmentation changes, pruritus, hot flashes, flatulence, mouth dryness, sense of smell or taste disturbance,
erectile impotence, decreased libido, oligospermia, and/or
insomnia) was considered a DLT. Unless a patient
stopped treatment because of toxicity, patients were evaluated for response if they were on therapy for at least 28
days; otherwise, they were replaced. PSA progression was
defined as a 100% increase over either the baseline (pretreatment, within 4 weeks of start of treatment) or nadir.
To further define PSA progression, the minimum change
in PSA needed was an absolute increase of 1 ng/mL, which
was confirmed by second value 3 to 4 weeks later.
Hormone Measurement

The ADVIA Centaur Testosterone assay kit (Siemens,
NY/USA) was used to measure testosterone in patients’ serum. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and estrogen were measured by ARUP
laboratories.

with significant PSA responses beginning 12 months prior to
treatment initiation and followed until end of treatment (Pt

Cytokine Multiplex Analysis

Per the manufacturer’s protocol, plasma samples were analyzed for 30 cytokines using the Human Cytokine
Thirty-Plex Antibody Bead Kit (Invitrogen). See Supporting Information for details regarding the procedure.
Analysis of Immunosuppressive Cell Subset in
Patients’ Blood

See Supporting Information for details regarding the analysis of immunosuppressive cell subset in patients’ blood.
Statistical Analysis and Data Management

Of the 6 different dosage levels tested in this study, no
MTD was reached. No signal was detected related to dosage, resulting in pooled analysis across dosages for
response rate and serum biomarkers. For binomial rates,
confidence intervals presented were calculated by the
Clopper-Pearson (exact) method. Due to the small number of samples available for serum biomarkers, nonparametric test (Wilcoxon rank sum) was used to compare
responders with nonresponders. Because these biomarker
evaluations were exploratory, there was no attempt to
adjust for multiple comparisons; thus significant results
require a confirmatory study.
RESULTS
Clinical Efficacy

A PSA complete response (CR), defined as a PSA decline
to 0.04 ng/mL (the threshold limit of detection at the
City of Hope National Medical Center), was confirmed at
Cancer

September 1, 2015

least 4 weeks later. The overall PSA response rate (the sum
of partial and complete responders vs nonresponders) was
4/36, or 11% (95% confidence interval, 4%-26%). Two
patients (at dosages of 8 and 14 g/d) experienced a prolonged CR that continues to date. At the time of this
report, the lengths of these CRs have been 49 and 30
months (Fig. 1). In another 2 patients, we observed a PSA
partial response (PR), which was defined as a 50% decline
from baseline PSA. One patient with PR demonstrated
durable response and has remained on the study for 39
months since beginning therapy. Another partial responder eventually had disease progression and was taken
off treatment after 7 months on therapy. At the time this
paper was prepared, an additional 5 patients remained on
protocol treatment because of their stable PSA values. Altogether, 8 patients remain on the study. Of 4 responders,
3 had a prior prostatectomy and salvage RT that was completed 4, 13, or 16 months prior to starting WBM powder
treatment. One patient with a PR had prior brachytherapy
followed by salvage prostatectomy. The characteristics of
the responders are summarized in Table 2. In addition to
the partial and complete responses, 36% of patients demonstrated some decline in PSA within 3 months after beginning therapy (Fig. 2). The median duration of therapy
for all patients was 10.2 months (range, 0.9-57.91
months). The patient with the longest treatment duration
has exhibited a stable PSA level.

Correlation of PSA and Testosterone in Patients
with CR

Two patients experienced a decrease in PSA to undetectable levels ( 0.04 ng/mL) during mushroom therapy;
this was maintained for 49 and 30 months. In both
patients, total serum testosterone levels fluctuated over
the study period; however, there was no noticeable trend.
Testosterone levels remained in the noncastrated range
(Fig. 3). PSA responses did not correlate with serum testosterone, DHT, or DHEA levels (data not shown).
Toxicity

Minimal side effects were noted and mostly limited to
grade 1 abdominal bloating (Table 3). The mean compliance with protocol-defined mushroom powder treatment
was 98.6%. One patient at dose level 3 (8 g/d) experienced grade 3 hyponatremia, possibly related to therapy,
and was taken off the protocol for toxicity. This occurred

during the second month (cycle 2) of therapy and therefore was not classified as a DLT.
Cytokine Multiplex Analysis

There were no definitive patterns for cytokine levels
except for interleukin-15 (IL-15). Both at baseline and
post-treatment, IL-15 levels of complete responders were
significantly higher than levels of nonresponders. Compared with baseline, IL-15 levels were not significantly
changed after 13 weeks of mushroom intake in both
complete-responders and nonresponders (Fig. 4A).

percentage of MDSCs (CD331HLA-DR2) decreased in
the 4 CR and PR patients; specifically, the levels dropped
by 78%, 45%, 94%, and 65%. In contrast, for the 9 nonresponders at week 13, the percentage did not decrease
significantly from enrollment (mean decrease of 25%). In
all groups after mushroom intake, no changes were apparent for CTLA4 T cells (CD41CD1521), T-regulatory
FoxP3 cells (CD41CD251FoxP31), or PD11 T cells
(CD41CD2791) (Fig. 4B).
DISCUSSION
In this study of 36 patients with biochemical recurrence of
prostate cancer, WBM powder therapy was associated
with declining PSA levels in 13 (36%) patients. Two
patients responded completely, and 2 other patients
responded partially. An additional 5 patients remain on
protocol treatment to date because of their stable PSA values. These results indicate that mushroom intake can
modulate PSA levels in biochemically recurrent prostate
cancer. When comparing responders with nonresponders,
the following factors did not correlate to response: daily
mushroom dose, Gleason score, baseline PSA level,
weight, age, baseline testosterone levels, and type of prior
therapy. We did not detect any effect of mushroom powder therapy on testosterone, DHT, or DHEA levels.
Importantly, in 2 patients, PSA decreased to
undetectable levels after WBM treatment. To the best
of our knowledge, this has not been observed in other
studies examining phytochemical compounds for biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. Almost all of the
patients in our study (92%), including 2 patients with
CR, had received prostatectomy and radiation therapy.

As such, patients had exhausted a chance for a cure
via traditional localized treatment. Compliance with
the daily ingestion of up to 28 large mushroom powder tablets was excellent, reflecting a lack of significant, chronic toxicity. The most common adverse
events were grade 1 abdominal bloating and grade 1
SGPT/SGOT elevation. One patient sustained asymptomatic grade 3 hyponatremia.
We were aware of potential confounding effects of
other medications (statins, thiazide diuretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)25 on PSA levels. As such,
on a monthly basis, we verified concurrent medications
and supplements. For 1 patient with prolonged stable
PSA, changes in PSA reflected both his cholesterol level
and compliance (or lack thereof) with simvastatin. For the
rest of the group, PSA responders did not change their
baseline medications or supplements. Importantly, they
did not ingest any compounds known to affect PSA levels.
In addition, we have not discovered any correlation
between weight changes and PSA; this was true for
patients demonstrating significant PSA responses.
According to the literature, WMB not only lowers blood
glucose and cholesterol levels in diabetic and hypercholesterolemic rats,26 but it also prevents hepatic steatosis in
2947

mice.27 However, we have not observed significant
changes in blood glucose and lipid levels in patients
treated with WBM.
Our trial examined 6 dosages beginning with 4 g/d.
The maximum dosage was capped at 14 g/d, because this
was thought to be the highest dosage that was practical to
ingest over a long period based on the number of tablets
required. Because there were no DLTs, dose determination is challenging. We observed CR and PR in the 8 g/d
group (Table 2); consequently, in future studies—especially single product studies on the mushroom powder/
tablets in asymptomatic patients—we will start patients
on 8 g/d, the minimum dose where we observed
responses, and permit the patient to escalate up to 14 g/d
if well tolerated.
For decades, the capacity of various mushrooms to
both inhibit tumor growth and modulate immune functions has been studied. Tumor growth was primarily inhibited by stimulating the immune system. In particular,
macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells were stimulated,
as were T cells and their cytokine production.28 Using the
Luminex platform, we assayed a variety of serum cytokines
involved in immune function, angiogenesis, and lipid and
bone metabolism; however, we did not observe a correlation between serum cytokine levels and PSA responses. Despite this result, the analysis produced an interesting
outcome: for 3 patients, with either CR or PR, particularly
high levels of plasma IL-15 were detected (compared with
nonresponsive patients). As it has been suggested, IL-15
may both promote NK cell differentiation and optimize
NK cell function.29 Congruent with this, in prostate tumor
models, IL-15 has been evaluated as an anticancer immunotherapeutic agent because it can effectively stimulate
lymphocyte subsets, including CD8 T cells, natural killer
cells, and natural killer T cells. Consequently, IL-15 can
promote tumor suppression. As evidenced in the literature,
WBM extract enhances NK cell activity in mice.30,31
Several clinical trials of IL-15 in cancer immunotherapy have been started recently; however, IL-15 may not be
optimal when it is used a single treatment. According to
Yu et al., combination therapies involving both
suppression of the immune negative feedback systems and
IL-15 therapy abrogated prostate tumor growth in mice
models.32 For the responding patients described herein
with high IL-15 levels, we hypothesize that WBM influences immune inhibition. In tumor-bearing mice, b-glucans,
which are extracted from mushrooms, can decrease the levels of tumor-associated immunosuppressive cells, such as
T-regulatory T cells.33 Thus, patients with high IL-15 levels may benefit from WBM treatment via suppression of
2948

immune-negative feedback effects. To both protect the
host from pernicious immune stimulation (excessive stimulation during infections) and to control autoimmune
responses, there are multiple mechanisms for immune
response attenuation. Through these inhibitory mechanisms, cancer cells can escape immune surveillance and
expand their niche. There are multiple inhibitory mechanisms to mediate cancer-related immune suppression.
Ligands that are expressed by antigen presenting cells or tumor cells can bind to T cells’ inhibitory receptors (CTLA4
and PD1). Furthermore, inhibitory cells (such as T-regulatory cells and MDSCs) can play critical roles in influencing
immune cells.34,35 Therefore, we performed an analysis of
immunosuppressive cell subset using patients’ PBMCs.
Interestingly, the percentage of MDSCs (CD331HLADR2) decreased significantly during mushroom intake in
2 CR and 2 PR patients. A direct link between the number
of MDSCs and the presence of primary prostate tumor has
been reported.36 MDSCs not only possess strong immunosuppressive activities, but they also play an important role
in angiogenesis. These cells secrete angiogenic growth factors, and they support tumor metastasis along multiple
steps of the process (invasion, embolism, and circulation).35 Therefore, patients with high IL-15 levels may
benefit from WBM treatment via a decrease in cancerrelated immune suppression involving MDSCs.
DHT, which is an active androgen, upregulates PSA
levels.37 WBM was also found to inhibit 5a-reductase, the
enzyme that produces DHT from testosterone. The
WBM extract inhibits both 5a-reductase 1 and 2 (Supporting Fig. 1). Although we did not detect changes in testosterone and DHT that were freely circulating, in tissues
we cannot rule out inhibitory effects of WBM on 5areductase (and thus tissue production of DHT).
The trial was performed with 2 lots of lyophilized
WBM powder. Both lots were obtained from Monterey
Mushrooms (Watsonville, CA). The standard assay in our
laboratory to define the activity of mushrooms or their
extract is to determine their anti-aromatase activity. The
assay procedure was reported by Kanaya et al.27 The water
extract generated from these lots inhibited aromatase in a
dose-dependent manner. Our laboratory first reported the
ability of WBMs to suppress the activity of aromatase, an
enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of estrogen.23 The
assay is robust and has been the method of choice for us to
compare the activity of different mushroom preparations.
It is not clear whether aromatase activity is a good surrogate for activity related to the effect observed in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, and efforts will be made to
develop assays more relevant to prostate cancer.

The lack of placebo control in our analysis raises the
following question: In this population of patients, do the
PSA responses simply represent natural variability of relatively low PSA levels? Based on both the literature and experience, this is unlikely. Specifically, consecutive rises in
PSA to 0.2 ng/mL (as required per eligibility criteria) in
post-prostatectomy patients almost always leads to eventual progression.2-4
In conclusion, WBM therapy appears to impact
PSA levels and potentially modulates the biology of
prostate cancer in some patients, especially in the setting of low tumor burden. Our future efforts will
focus on both the isolation and characterization of
WBM compounds with anti–prostate cancer activity
and the development of a placebo-controlled clinical
trial in patients with early biochemical recurrence of
