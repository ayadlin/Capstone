BACKGROUND: The authors examined the “real-world” effectiveness of rituximab (R) maintenance therapy (R-maintenance) compared with observation after R-based induction therapy in patients with previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) in the United
States. METHODS: The National LymphoCare Study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study that enrolled > 2700 untreated
patients with FL diagnosed from 2004 to 2007 at 265 sites in the United States. Among these, patients who achieved at least stable
disease after R-based induction therapy were eligible for the current analysis. Patients who initiated R-maintenance within 215 days
of completing induction therapy were categorized as the R-maintenance group, and those who did not initiate therapy during this period were categorized as the observation group. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of R-maintenance on
progression-free survival (PFS), time to next treatment (TTNT), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 1439 patients completed R-based induction therapy, 1186 of whom met all inclusion criteria (541 patients received R-maintenance and 645 patients were
observed). Characteristics that were found to be predictive of receiving R-maintenance were histology grade (1/2), Ann Arbor stage
of disease (III/IV), geographic region (region other than the West), and practice setting (community practice). With a median followup of 5.7 years, R-maintenance was associated with superior PFS (hazards ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.560.84 [P 5.0003]) and TTNT (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52-0.84 [P 5.0007]). No significant difference in OS was observed (HR, 0.81; 95% CI,
0.58-1.14 [P 5.23]). CONCLUSIONS: R-maintenance in patients with FL and at least stable disease after R-based induction therapy
provided significantly longer PFS and TTNT in comparison with observation, but no significant difference in OS was observed with 5years of follow-up. This comparative effectiveness study aligns with the results of randomized trials suggesting that similar outcomes

INTRODUCTION
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent lymphoma in the United States.1,2 The majority of patients with
FL present with advanced disease (Ann Arbor stage III or IV) and are considered incurable with standard therapy, which has
led to marked heterogeneity in goals of therapy and, consequently, practice patterns across the United States.3,4 In the prerituximab era, FL has been associated with a high overall response rates to initial therapy5 coupled with repeated recurrences
and disease-free intervals that become progressively shorter.6 Management strategies that may extend the disease-free interval
in patients with FL have been investigated, including the use of rituximab (R) maintenance therapy (R-maintenance).7-10
The randomized Primary Rituximab and Maintenance (PRIMA) study demonstrated that 2 years of R-maintenance
after first-line treatment with chemoimmunotherapy in patients with FL improved progression-free survival (PFS) in
comparison with observation,11 leading to the approval of R-maintenance after R-based induction therapy in 2011.
Before the publication of the PRIMA study results, the clinical benefit of R-maintenance was reported in randomized studies including patients with recurrent or resistant FL who were treated with chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy.8,9,12

Effectiveness of R-Maintenance in FL/Nastoupil et al

In addition, R-maintenance was studied in previously
untreated patients who received single-agent R induction7,10 or chemotherapy alone13 and again was found to
be associated with prolonged PFS. To the best of our
knowledge, no head-to-head data are available comparing
the various schedules and duration of maintenance dosing.
Based on these reports, R-maintenance has been used frequently in clinical practice in the United States and other
countries. The objective of the current analysis of the
National LymphoCare Study (NLCS) was to examine
choice of schedule and duration of R-maintenance used by
practicing physicians in the United States after Rcontaining induction therapy; delineate the clinical characteristics, treatment setting, and response to induction associated with R-maintenance; and report on the “realworld” effectiveness of R-maintenance compared with observation after R-based induction therapy in previously
untreated patients with FL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The NLCS is a prospective, multicenter, observational
study collecting data regarding > 2700 previously
untreated patients with FL diagnosed from 2004 to 2007
at 265 sites in the United States, as previously described.4
Written informed consent was obtained from individual
patients before participation and the protocol was
approved by each Institutional Review Board. Eligible
patients for this study were adults (age  18 years) diagnosed with FL within 6 months of enrollment, and with
no prior history of lymphoma. This analysis was further
restricted to patients who had at least stable disease (SD)
after an R-based induction regimen. Patients with mixed
or non-FL histology or those who developed disease progression before receiving treatment were excluded from
analysis. There was no central pathology review; the local
pathology report defined FL diagnosis after investigators
were educated regarding World Health Organization classification system definitions of FL.4 Initial and subsequent
management decisions were made by the treating physician
without protocol-specified treatment assignments or recommendations. All response assessments were made by the
treating physician and were reported quarterly. Safety data
were limited to treatment-related toxicity as measured by
death, early treatment discontinuation, and hospitalization.
NLCS data management and analysis are guided by
an advisory board composed of academic investigators
and a patient advocate, some of whom coauthored this article (J.W.F., B.K.L., J.R.C., and C.R.F.). The advisory
board participated in all phases of the study, including initial protocol design, prospective determination of data to
Cancer

be collected, and consideration of participating sites. The
advisory board meets quarterly, has full access to data listings, and collaborated with the primary author (L.J.N.)
and the sponsor regarding the interpretation and publication of the data. This article was written de novo by the
primary author (L.J.N.) and members of the advisory
board after the approval of a protocol with prespecified
endpoints, hypotheses, and plans for analysis.
Patients who were on study and had not experienced
progressive disease (PD) 215 days after completing initial
therapy with an R-based regimen and who achieved a
complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or SD
were included in the current analysis. Patients were
included in the following groups: observation if no additional treatment was initiated within 215 days after the
completion of initial therapy or R-maintenance if Rmaintenance and no additional treatment was initiated
within 215 days after the completion of initial therapy.
The 215-day period was chosen based on prior studies7,8,13 and reviewing the distribution of the number of
days between the end of induction and the start of subsequent R-maintenance, but before any outcomes analyses
were performed. Approximately 90% of the patients who
had received R-maintenance initiated maintenance within
215 days from the end of their first treatment. Secondline treatment was defined as the second treatment management strategy assigned by the treating physician. However, if R-monotherapy was initiated after the first
treatment management strategy to maintain a previous
response, it was considered as R-maintenance rather than
second-line treatment.
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the number of
days from the end of the 215-day postinduction period up
to and including the date of death from any cause. PFS
was defined as the time from the end of the 215-day postinduction period up to and including the date of PD as
assessed by the treating physician, or death from any
cause. Time to next treatment (TTNT) was defined as the
time from the end of the 215-day postinduction period
up to and including the date of initiation of a next treatment for any reason. Patients who had not yet experienced
an event at the time of analysis were censored at the date
of the most recent response assessment (for PFS) or last
date of contact (for TTNT and OS).
Statistical Analysis

Patient demographics, clinical characteristics at the time
of diagnosis, treatment setting, induction treatment, and
best response to induction treatment were summarized by
group, using descriptive statistics. Pearson chi-square tests
1831

Original Article

were performed to examine the difference between Rmaintenance versus observation. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors for receiving Rmaintenance using backward selection (P > .05). KaplanMeier estimation was used to evaluate OS, PFS, and
TTNT for the 2 groups along with the log-rank test. Cox
proportional hazards models were used to compare the
outcomes of R-maintenance and observation with regard
to OS, PFS, and TTNT, adjusting for demographic
characteristics, Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) risk factors, and treatment setting
(region and academic/community practice). Additional
sensitivity analyses were performed using propensity score
methodologies to adjust for imbalances between the
R-maintenance and observation groups. Sex, age, number
of lymph node sites, lactate dehydrogenase level, hemoglobin level, bone marrow involvement, geographic
region, practice setting, oncologist density within 50
miles, race, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, Ann Arbor stage of disease, number of
extranodal sites, histologic grade, presence of B symptoms, induction treatment, and response to the induction
treatment were used to determine a propensity score for
the probability of assignment to a particular treatment
given the observed values. Five categories were used for
induction treatment (R-monotherapy, R-CVP [rituximab
plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone],
R-CHOP [rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone], R-fludarabine, and
R-other). The FLIPI risk group was not used to calculate
the propensity score because individual FLIPI components were used in the model. Patients with the same propensity score had the same probability of being assigned
to the particular treatment and provide comparisons that
limited bias in estimating the treatment effects. In the current analysis, we defined 5 propensity score strata based
on the quintiles of the propensity scores in the overall
sample.
RESULTS
Of the more than 2700 patients enrolled in the NLCS
between 2004 and 2007, a total of 1439 received and
completed R-based induction therapy (R-monotherapy or
R-chemotherapy). Of these, 1186 patients met all inclusion criteria for these analyses, as shown in Figure 1. A
total of 541 patients initiated R-maintenance in the 215day postinduction period, and 645 patients were
observed. The baseline characteristics of patients who
received R-maintenance or observation are shown in

predictive of receiving R-maintenance based on multiple
logistic regression were histology grade (1/2), Ann Arbor
disease stage (III/IV), geographic region (any region other
than the West), and practice setting (community practice)
(Table 2).
On average, R-maintenance was initiated 113 days
(interquartile range [IQR], 56 days-176 days) after the
end of the R-based induction therapy, and the mean duration of R-maintenance was 546 days (IQR, 318 days-674
days). Patients received R-maintenance with several dosing schedules: R weekly for 4 weeks every 6 months (39%
of patients), 1 dose every 2 or 3 months (24% of patients),
or another schedule (37% of patients). Overall, 82% of
patients receiving R-maintenance completed the planned
maintenance therapy with a mean of 13 doses (IQR, 8
doses-16 doses). A total of 71 patients (13%) prematurely
discontinued R-maintenance; 23% discontinued treatment due to PD (16 patients), 13% discontinued treatment as a result of treatment-related toxicity (9 patients; 1
patient received R-monotherapy as induction therapy and
8 patients received R-chemotherapy induction), and 8%
of patients discontinued treatment due to death (6
patients). A total of 36 patients (51%) discontinued Rmaintenance for other reasons, and the remaining 6% of

in multiple variable Cox proportional hazards models,
R-maintenance was found to be significantly associated
with a superior PFS (hazards ratio [HR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.56-0.84 [P 5 .0003]) and longer TTNT (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52-0.84 [P 5 .0007]).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the largest published series of
prospectively enrolled patients with previously untreated
FL in the modern era examining the effectiveness of
R-maintenance in clinical practice. In addition, the current study reported on the R-maintenance strategies used
by practicing physicians and identified characteristics
related to whether a patient received R-maintenance. This
is of particular interest in that we examined practice patterns in an era of early adoption of R-maintenance after
an R-based induction therapy, before published reports
supporting this practice. With > 5 years of follow-up,
patients who received R-maintenance after responding
with at least SD after an R-based induction therapy were
found to have significantly longer PFS and TTNT compared with patients who were observed. These differences
occurred even with the heterogeneity in the
R-maintenance schedules used. To the best of our knowledge, despite improvements in PFS and TTNT, no statistically significant difference in OS has been observed to
date. If the true OS HR was 0.81, then with the current
number of OS events we would only have 30% power to
demonstrate an OS difference, and therefore substantially

longer follow-up (or a substantially larger population of
FL patients in the United States) would be required to
evaluate OS. Consistent results were noted after adjusting
for FLIPI risk components, sex, race, histologic grade,
region, treatment setting, and induction treatment using
standard Cox proportional hazards models or when incorporating propensity scores.
With the expectation of FL to be highly responsive
to initial therapy, coupled with disease recurrence and a
shorter duration of remission with each recurrence, it is
not surprising that physicians have used maintenance
strategies in an attempt to extend the duration of remission. An ideal maintenance approach would be an effective therapy that is nontoxic and convenient. Because
R infusion is typically well tolerated and is relatively easy
to administer, it had been considered a suitable therapy to
use in a maintenance regimen. We found that the use of
R as a maintenance strategy after R-based induction therapy was commonly adopted by physicians in the United
States in the period before the publication of the PRIMA
results supporting this approach.11 Presumably, this early
adoption was based on several randomized controlled
trials demonstrating that R-maintenance was associated
with prolonged event-free survival and PFS in comparison
with observation in either the first-line setting or in
patients with recurrent FL.8,10,14 Following strategies
described in these published reports, various dosing
schedules were used, including a single dose administered
every 2 months to 3 months or 4 weekly doses every 6
months. The majority of the patients in the current study
received R-maintenance using one of these previously
described dosing schedules. In addition, 37% of patients
in the R-maintenance group received R-maintenance on a
schedule that could not be classified as being based on a

published dosing schedule, and for 4% of patients, Rmaintenance was ongoing at the time of last follow-up,
well beyond the 2-year duration of maintenance supported by the PRIMA study. These data highlight the
challenges in applying emerging evidence regarding the
efficacy of maintenance therapy to patients receiving
ongoing cancer care who are in the midst of follow-up.
In addition to disease-specific features such as histologic grade (grade 1/2 FL) and stage (III/IV), practice patterns regarding R-maintenance use were found to be
significantly associated with the practice setting. For
example, patients who were treated in a community practice were more likely to receive R-maintenance compared
with those who received treatment in an academic setting,
and we also observed regional variation in the use of Rmaintenance. Also of interest are the factors that were not
found to be associated with receipt of R-maintenance,
including FLIPI risk and degree of response to induction
treatment. How these systematic variations in treatment
selection impact outcomes is not well understood, and
should be explored in future studies.
An alternative approach to R-maintenance is R
retreatment at the time of PD, a strategy that was investigated in the randomized, phase 3 trial, ECOG 4402,
Rituximab Extended Schedule or Retreatment Trial
(RESORT).15 This study included asymptomatic patients
with FL with low tumor burden who did not meet the

randomized to receive either R-maintenance once every 3
months or retreatment at the time of each instance of PD.
Preliminary findings suggest that although patients on the
maintenance therapy arm delayed time to first cytotoxic
therapy compared with those on the retreatment arm,
there were no differences in time to treatment failure or
quality of life for patients who received R-maintenance
compared with those who received R retreatment at the
time of PD in this setting. To the best of our knowledge,
the question of how these strategies compare in patients
with FL with high tumor burden and in those receiving
chemoimmunotherapy induction remains untested in
randomized trials. Additional follow-up of patients in our
observation group who later received single-agent R (12%
currently) may provide opportunities for comparing the
effectiveness of this strategy with maintenance therapy.
Another important consideration when evaluating the
use of R-maintenance is the toxicity associated with extended
dosing of R. In the current analysis, we explored the tolerability of R-maintenance by examining the rates of and reasons for early discontinuation of therapy. Of the 71 patients
who discontinued R-maintenance (13%), 9 patients (13%)
discontinued therapy because of toxicity. The risk of symptomatic hypogammaglobulinemia resulting in intravenous immunoglobulin administration in patients with B-cell
lymphoma treated with multiple courses of R has been
reported to be 6.6%.16 In the randomized PRIMA study, after 2 years of R-maintenance, serum concentration levels of
immunoglobulin isotypes did not differ significantly
between the R-maintenance and observation groups.11
Concerns also have been raised regarding inducing resistance to R with extended dosing. In the current study, we
examined the reasons for second-line treatment being
administered and response to the various management strategies used. For the vast majority of patients in either group,
second-line treatment was initiated because of PD. Approximately 24% of patients in the R-maintenance group
received second-line treatment; of these, 36% received
R-monotherapy and 31% received R-chemotherapy. Similarly, in the observation group, 29% received second-line
treatment; of these, 41% received R-monotherapy and 30%
received R-chemotherapy and the response was found to be
similar between the 2 groups. PFS after second-line treatment containing R appeared to be similar between the 2
groups, suggesting that extended dosing of R did not appear
to impact the response or duration of response to secondline treatment.

The limitations of the current study are similar to
those of other observational studies, including the potential for selection bias in patient treatment choice, unmeasured confounding, and response outcome assessment
based on routine clinical practice of the treating physician.
In addition, data were not available to define whether
patients had high or low tumor burden. Recognizing these
threats, the NLCS and these analyses have been conducted
in accordance with established guidelines for performing
comparative effectiveness research.17-19 A formal study
protocol including a data analysis plan was submitted
before the design and execution of the current study.
Analyses identified and controlled for confounding factors, an additional sensitivity analysis was performed (propensity score), and data were compared with available
results from randomized clinical trials. Thus, these findings can support and augment the causal inference drawn
from the results of randomized trials.
From this large, prospective, observational study
with > 5 years of follow-up, we found that receipt of Rmaintenance was not associated with significantly longer
OS in previously untreated patients with FL who achieved
at least SD after R-based induction therapy. With deaths
observed in only 10% of patients in the current study, longer follow-up is needed. PFS and TTNT were found to be
longer in comparison with patients in the observed group.
These findings are consistent with the randomized
PRIMA study, which demonstrated a significantly prolonged PFS with 2 years of R-maintenance for patients
with advanced stage untreated FL who responded to an Rbased induction therapy. Debate continues as to whether
R-maintenance is indicated for all patients in the frontline
setting or whether increasing PFS and delaying TTNT are
meaningful treatment goals in selecting a maintenance
strategy. The results of the current study also delineate the
heterogeneity in the prescribing patterns of Rmaintenance use with adoption before the publication of
randomized data supporting the practice after R-based
induction therapy, and suggest that significant challenges
exist when applying emerging evidence from randomized
clinical trials on maintenance therapy to patients receiving
ongoing cancer care and follow-up.
