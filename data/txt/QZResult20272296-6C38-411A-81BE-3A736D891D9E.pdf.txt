Abstract
To capitalize on the response of tumor cells to XRT, we developed a controlled-release nanoparticle drug
delivery system using a targeting peptide that recognizes a radiation-induced cell surface receptor. Phage
display biopanning identified Gly-Ile-Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly (GIRLRG) as a peptide that selectively recognizes
tumors responding to XRT. Membrane protein extracts of irradiated glioma cells identified glucose-regulated
protein GRP78 as the receptor target for GIRLRG. Antibodies to GRP78 blocked the binding of GIRLRG in vitro
and in vivo. Conjugation of GIRLRG to a sustained-release nanoparticle drug delivery system yielded increased
paclitaxel concentration and apoptosis in irradiated breast carcinomas for up to 3 weeks. Compared with
controls, a single administration of the GIRLRG-targeted nanoparticle drug delivery system to irradiated
tumors delayed the in vivo tumor tripling time by 55 days (P = 0.0001) in MDA-MB-231 and 12 days in
GL261 (P < 0.005). This targeting agent combines a novel recombinant peptide with a paclitaxel-encapsulating
nanoparticle that specifically targets irradiated tumors, increasing apoptosis and tumor growth delay in a
manner superior to known chemotherapy approaches. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4550–9. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
In vitro, many agents are capable of killing cancer cells
effectively. These agents trigger cancer cell death through
numerous complex pathways, such as apoptosis or prevention
of further cell division. However, when these agents are transferred from use in cell culture to an entire system, the effect on
normal tissue limits their use in a clinical setting. With a small
therapeutic index between cancer destruction and toxic side
effects, drugs are often not used in patients or discontinued
far before they achieve a maximal effect.
Thus, targeted therapy provides a means to circumvent
the toxicities and lack of treatment response of conventional
systemic chemotherapy. With the development of targeted
biologicals, such as trastuzumab and imatinib, therapies for
specific cancer types have been developed. However, these

therapeutics are often limited to cancers expressing various
mutations and thus are limited in broad use (1, 2). Treatments aimed at universal solid tumor therapy, such as angiogenesis inhibitors, have had limited success thus far (3).
The discovery of receptors expressed at much greater
levels on tumors than on normal tissue would provide targets
for drug delivery. Therefore, receptor induction in tumors
could play a critical role in providing new targets. Ionizing
radiation (XRT), although also therapeutic, could potentially
cause cellular stress localized to cancer cells, which may
cause new receptor translocation. Beyond its cytotoxic
effects, XRT has been shown to induce gene transcription
(4) and protein expression on tumor microvasculature (5).
Using phage display biopanning, recombinant peptides that
bind only to treated cancers have been found (6, 7). However,
combining these peptides with chemotherapeutic agents has
not been effectively translated to clinical use.
Through targeted therapeutics, nanoparticle delivery systems have the potential to overcome the normal tissue
toxicity of traditional chemotherapy. However, although paclitaxel encapsulation in albumin nanoparticles, nab-paclitaxel,
increases the efficacy and safety over paclitaxel formulated in
Cremophor (8–10), more nausea, diarrhea, and grade 3 sensory
neuropathy occurs in patients treated with nab-paclitaxel (8).
Another remaining challenge of nanoparticle delivery systems
is the lack of control of drug release profiles. This distinct
“burst effect,” in which the majority of drug is released in a
rapid and uncontrollable fashion, creates unpredictable pharmacokinetics, thereby making effective dose regimens difficult
to predict.
Our goal is to identify a novel recombinant peptide and a
radiation-inducible receptor pair in XRT-treated cancers and

work, we present three new findings: the discovery of a
recombinant peptide that recognizes XRT-treated tumors,
the discovery of the radiation-inducible receptor of this peptide, and the therapeutic benefits of a targeted recombinant

clonal serum IgG antibody was used as a control. In
a third experiment, mice received an unlabeled blocking
antibody to GRP78 or unlabeled polyclonal IgG serum
and then injected with the labeled Gly-Ile-Arg-Leu-ArgGly (GIRLRG) peptide. Near IR images were taken using
the IVIS imaging system with an ICG filter setting at various time points after the injection.

Materials and Methods

Membrane protein extraction
GL261 tumor samples either treated with 3 Gy XRT or
sham XRT were removed from the hind limbs of athymic
nude mice 48 hours after treatment and frozen at −80°C.
Forty-milligram samples of treated and untreated frozen
tumors were homogenized, and the protein was extracted
using the Mem-PER Eukaryotic Membrane Protein Extraction Kit (ThermoScientific). The extracted protein was then
incubated overnight in the Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassettes
(ThermoScientific). The protein was then incubated overnight
with NeutrAvidin-coated agarose beads (ThermoScientific)
bound to biotinylated GIRLRG or scrambled peptide (RILGGR).
After incubation, the beads were washed with 1× PBS, boiled
at 100°C, and run on an Invitrogen NuPAGE 10% gel. The gel
was stained with Invitrogen Simply Blue SafeStain. Bands
from the gel were analyzed by the Vanderbilt Proteomics
Core through the liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry technique.

Animals used
Athymic nude and C57/Bl6 mice were purchased from
Harlan Laboratories. All animal protocols were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Tumor models
GL261 murine glioma and MDA-MB-231 human breast
cancer cell lines were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection. Heterotopic tumor models were developed by s.c. inoculating cell suspensions (6 × 106 cells) into
nude or C57/Bl6 mice.
Coculture assays
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in the
sixth passage (Lonza) and GL261 murine glioma cells were
cocultured as previously described (7). The cells were
allowed to interact for 1 day before treatment with 3 Gy
XRT and incubated for 3 hours before they were harvested.
Coverslips were blocked for 30 minutes with 5% bovine
serum albumin and 1% streptavidin (ThermoScientific).
Cells were incubated for 1 hour with a streptavidin-peptideAlexaFluor594 complex (AlexaFluor594 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester was purchased from Invitrogen; Supplementary
Fig. S1). HUVEC nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole, and images of nuclei and peptide binding were
taken by Vanderbilt Cell Imaging Shared Resource Center using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope at 40× magnification. Cell colocalization was done using Metamorph Offline
software in all assays.
Similarly, 3 × 105 HUVECs were layered in coculture plates
alone and treated with 3 Gy or left untreated, incubated
with streptavidin-peptide-AlexaFluor594 complex, and imaged as before. Positive and negative controls of XRT-treated
and untreated GL261/HUVEC cocultures with the peptide
incubated on HUVECs were used. Assays were done three
times in triplicate.
Near IR imaging
Tumor-bearing mice were treated with three once-daily
doses of 3 Gy XRT or sham XRT (three per group) and
injected with peptide or antibody 3 hours after the last
XRT treatment. In one experiment, labeled complexes of
biotinylated peptide-AlexaFluor750 conjugates were injected (AlexaFluor750 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester
was purchased from Invitrogen). In a second experiment,
an antibody to 78-kDa glucose regulated protein (GRP78)
conjugated with AlexaFluor750 was injected and tumors
were removed 7 days after labeled antibody injection; poly-

Western blotting
Nude mice implanted s.c. in the hind limb with either
GL261 and MDA-MB-231 tumors were treated with 3 Gy
XRT for 3 consecutive days, and tumors were removed
48 hours post-XRT. Tumor samples were homogenized, and
the protein from the samples was extracted. Protein was
probed with antibodies for GRP78 and actin (Cell Signaling)
on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and exposed to film
that was later developed using the Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Plus detection system (Perkin-Elmer) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-embedded tumor samples were stained using an
antibody for the von Willebrand factor (vWF; DakoCytomation) at a 1:100 dilution from the original stock solution of
3.1 g/L and incubated overnight. Samples were then incubated with a streptavidin-peptide-AlexaFluor594 complex
and washed three times with PBS.
In a second assay, samples were stained with vWF and incubated with an antibody to GRP78 at dilutions of 1:250 and
1:1,000 of original stock solution. These samples were then
incubated with streptavidin-peptide-AlexaFluor594 complex
and imaged.
Images were taken using a fluorescent microscope at 20×
magnification. Assays were performed in triplicate.
Nanoparticle synthesis and attachment of GIRLRG
peptide to nanoparticles
Polyester nanoparticle DDS was synthesized by the procedure described by van der Ende and colleagues (11).

hind limb with GL261 glioma cells and were either left untreated or treated daily with radiation (3 Gy) for 5 consecutive days (three mice per treatment
group). Tumor sections were incubated with vWF, an endothelial marker, followed by fluorescently labeled GIRLRG, and imaged. Untreated tumor sections
and XRT-treated tumor sections 48 hours posttreatment are shown. D, nude mice were implanted in the hind limb with GL261 glioma cells and were

preferentially binds to radiation-treated tumors in GL261 xenografts compared with untreated tumors.

KKCGGGGIRLRG peptide (56 mg, 3.35 μmol) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; 2 mL) was added to a solution of nanoparticles
from poly(valerolactoneepoxyvalerolactone-allylvalerolactone-oxepanedione) containing 11% epoxide and cross-linked
with 1 equivalent of 2,2-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) per
epoxide (ref. 11; 105.6 mg, 0.78 μmol) in DMSO (1 mL). The
reaction mixture was heated for 72 hours at 34°C. Residual
peptide was removed by dialyzing with SnakeSkin Pleated Dialysis Tubing (molecular weight cutoff 10,000) against 50/50
THF/CH3CN.
Encapsulation of paclitaxel in GIRLRG-conjugated

and was found to be 11.3%.
Paclitaxel antibody staining
Nude mice were implanted in the hind limb with MDA-MB231 tumors. Once tumors reached 450 mm3 in volume, mice
were treated with 3 Gy XRT once daily for 3 consecutive days
or were left untreated. On the 2nd day, mice were injected with
one of either (a) systemic paclitaxel, (b) paclitaxel/nanoparticle with RILGGR, or (c) paclitaxel/nanoparticle with GIRLRG.
The paclitaxel concentration used was 10 mg/kg. Tumors were
removed 1 and 3 weeks after treatment, embedded in paraffin,
and sectioned. Tumor sections were incubated with a monoclonal antibody to paclitaxel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a
concentration of 1:500. Three mice per group were used. All
paclitaxel antibody staining was performed in triplicate.

Radiation-Induced GRP78 Mediates Targeted Drug Delivery

Results

Using a previously characterized in vivo biopanning method
to screen the T7 phage–based random peptide library (6, 7),
the novel peptide GIRLRG was identified as the predominant
phage-encoded peptide recovered from irradiated GL261 gliomas in mice (Fig. 1A). We then investigated the specificity
of GIRLRG for irradiated tumors using in vitro coculture
experiments. To model the tumor microenvironment, we
used HUVECs cocultured with GL261 tumor cells. These
experiments revealed that the GIRLRG targeting peptide
bound to tumor vasculature only when two criteria were
met: tumor cells were irradiated and tumor cells were able
to interact with HUVECs (Fig. 1B). To simulate normal tissue,
HUVECs were cultured alone. There was no binding of the
GIRLRG recombinant peptide to this normal tissue model,
suggesting an obligate interaction between the tumor and tumor vasculature for the target receptor of the peptide to be
available for binding. We also found that the GIRLRG peptide
colocalizes with an endothelial cell marker in irradiated
tumor samples ex vivo (Fig. 1C). We then used an in vivo
binding model using near IR imaging with GL261 tumors
implanted in the hind limbs of mice. The GIRLRG targeting
peptide was again shown to preferentially bind to radiationtreated tumors in vivo over untreated tumors (Fig. 1D).

Discovery of a peptide that recognizes irradiated tumors
We used phage display technology to identify a targeting
peptide that would discriminately bind to irradiated tumors.

GRP78 is induced by XRT in tumors
We next sought to discover the target of GIRLRG. Agarose
beads coated with GIRLRG were incubated with membrane

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling staining
Nude mice were treated and tumors were collected as described in the above section. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
staining was done with the DeadEnd Colorimetric TUNEL
System (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Positive staining was observed by light microscopy.
Paclitaxel antibody staining and TUNEL staining
evaluation
All slides were evaluated and graded based on color intensity of immunoreactions using a six-tier grading system of
5 to 6 (strong), 3 to 4 (moderate), 1 to 2 (faint), and 0 (none).
Assays were performed in triplicate.
Statistical analyses
Student's t test was used to perform group comparisons.
Linear correlations of peptide binding and tumor response
to treatment were developed by using the correlation coefficient of tumor growth and radiance data sets (SigmaPlot).

with GIRLRG peptide coated on agarose beads. B, GRP78 is induced in HUVECs grown in coculture with GL261 gliomas after XRT treatment. GL261 glioma
cells (3 × 105) and HUVECs (1 × 104) were cocultured for 24 hours before treatment with 3 Gy XRT. Three hours posttreatment, AlexaFluor594-labeled
GRP78 antibodies were added to the culture plates. C, Western blot of GRP78 expression in XRT-treated and untreated (No Tx) GL261 glioma and

selectively to XRT-treated tumors. GL261 tumors were implanted in the hind limbs of nude mice and treated with 3 Gy XRT for 3 consecutive days.
On the 3rd day, an antibody to GRP78 or IgG antibody serum conjugated with AlexaFluor750 was injected through the tail veins of mice. Tumors were
removed 7 days after peptide injection and imaged using near IR imaging to assess relative levels of peptide binding.

Figure 3. GRP78 is the target of GIRLRG. A, GL261 glioma cells and HUVECs were cocultured for 24 hours before treatment with 3 Gy XRT followed by
blocking antibody to GRP78 or a control IgG antibody serum. Cells were then incubated with AlexaFluor594-labeled GIRLRG peptide and imaged for
peptide binding. B, GL261 gliomas implanted in the hind limbs of nude mice were treated with 3 Gy XRT daily for 3 days, sectioned and incubated
with a polyclonal antibody to GRP78 at antibody concentrations of 1:1,000 and 1:250. C and D, GL261 gliomas implanted in the hind limbs of nude mice
(three mice per treatment group) were treated with 3 Gy XRT daily for 3 days. One hour after the final XRT treatment, mice were injected with either a
polyclonal antibody to GRP78 or IgG antibody serum. Three hours after antibody administration, mice were injected with GIRLRG peptide labeled with
AlexaFluor750. C, mice were imaged 24 hours after the final XRT treatment using near IR imaging. D, graph of relative peptide binding in vivo in mice

protein extracts from irradiated GL261 tumors and removed
48 hours postirradiation. We isolated a 78-kDa band by gel
electrophoresis. Mass spectrometry of that band revealed it
to be GRP78 (Fig. 2A). Therefore, we investigated the effects
of radiation on GRP78 concentration. In vitro, we found that
GRP78 is induced in HUVECs grown in coculture with GL261
gliomas after XRT treatment (Fig. 2B). Membrane protein extract from GL261 gliomas and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinomas were analyzed for GRP78 expression through Western
blot (Fig. 2C). The results revealed increased GRP78 expression
after radiation treatment, in both tumor types, compared with
controls. GRP78 upregulation in response to XRT in GL261 gliomas was validated ex vivo (Supplementary Fig. S2) and in vivo
(Fig. 2D). Tumors implanted in the hind limbs of nude mice
were treated with XRT, then injected with either a fluorescently labeled GRP78 antibody or labeled control polyclonal
serum IgG, and imaged using near IR imaging. Tumors treated
with XRT showed intense binding of fluorescently labeled antibody to GRP78 compared with IgG serum controls (Fig. 2D).
GRP78 and GIRLRG interaction studies
We next studied the putative ligand-receptor interaction
between the GIRLRG peptide and GRP78. This was accomplished through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experiments

4554

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

using blocking antibodies to GRP78. In vitro cocultures with
GL261/HUVECs showed decreased binding of GIRLRG to
HUVECs when blocking antibodies to GRP78 were added
to the coculture (Fig. 3A). Next, we treated implanted
GL261 tumors in mice with XRT, removed and sectioned
the tumors, and treated with varying concentrations of
GRP78 blocking antibody. We found that as the GRP78 blocking antibody concentration increased, binding of fluorescently labeled GIRLRG decreased (Fig. 3B). An in vivo
imaging study was performed to assess if fluorescently
labeled GIRLRG peptide could still bind to XRT-treated
tumors following the addition of an antibody to GRP78.
The GRP78 antibody attenuated GIRLRG signal intensity by
>70% compared with control IgG serum antibody in irradiated GL261 tumors (P < 0.05; Fig. 3C and D).
Creation of a GIRLRG-targeted nanoparticle DDS
We postulated that conjugating the GIRLRG recombinant
peptide with a nanoparticle DDS could target chemotherapeutics specifically to radiated tumors. After nanoparticle formation (11), the peptide was conjugated using a high-yielding
thiol-ene reaction, reacting the free thiol of the cysteine near
the NH2 terminus of the KKCGGGGIRLRG with allyl functionalities on the nanoparticle (12). Nuclear magnetic resonance

spectroscopy methods could determine the conjugation of 37
peptides (Fig. 4). In the final step, paclitaxel was incorporated,
resulting in a DDS that is well dispersed in a Cremophor-free
solution. The biocompatibility of peptide-targeted particles in
concentrations applied for in vivo studies was confirmed in
cytotoxicity assays (Supplementary Fig. S3).
GIRLRG-targeted nanoparticle DDS increases
paclitaxel concentration and apoptosis in
irradiated tumors
We next investigated the effects of the GIRLRG-targeted
nanoparticle DDS on paclitaxel concentration and apoptosis
in tumors compared with controls. MDA-MB-231 breast
carcinomas were implanted in the hind limbs of nude mice
and treated as described in Fig. 5. Tumors were harvested
at 1 and 3 weeks posttreatment, and the levels of paclitaxel
(Fig. 5A and B) and apoptosis (Fig. 5C and D) were determined with the respective cell staining assays and quantified.
Paclitaxel was found in significantly greater concentrations
in the targeted nanoparticle group with the use of irradiation
over all other treatment groups at 1 and 3 weeks (P < 0.05;
Fig. 5A and B). Similarly, TUNEL staining of these tumor sections showed that at 1 and 3 weeks, the nanoparticle-GIRLRG

DDS was superior to radiation and systemic paclitaxel in maintaining persistent cytotoxicity (P < 0.05; Fig. 5C and D). In fact,
staining for paclitaxel and apoptosis significantly persisted for
3 weeks after just a single administration of the nanoparticle
over the other control groups (P < 0.05), indicating that the
nanoparticle-GIRLRG peptide complex provides a prolonged
and sustained release of paclitaxel when properly targeted to
the tumor with XRT.
Treatment with targeted nanoparticle DDS produces
in vivo tumor growth delay
Our primary outcome to determine the overall efficacy of
our novel targeting nanoparticle DDS was to assess tumor
volume tripling time in human tumor cell lines and in syngeneic mouse tumors. Therefore, we implanted MDA-MB-231
breast carcinomas in nude mice and GL261 gliomas in C57/
B16 mice and performed a tumor growth delay study after
treating the mice as shown in Fig. 6. Our results showed that
MDA-MB-231 tumor tripling time was delayed 55 days with
the nanoparticle-targeted peptide with XRT (P = 0.0001), compared with 11 to 14 days by the three other XRT treatment
groups (P < 0.05; Fig. 6A). Both unirradiated nanoparticle
groups provided no significant tumor growth delay when

GIRLRG-targeted nanoparticle DDS increases paclitaxel concentration in irradiated breast cancers. MDA-MB-231 breast carcinomas were implanted
in the hind limbs of nude mice and treated with 3 Gy XRT daily for 3 days, and systemic paclitaxel, targeted nanoparticle (NP) DDS, or random peptide

compared with the untreated control, suggesting that even
nanoparticle-GIRLRG is not adequately targeted in unirradiated tumors. The administration of radiation with systemic
paclitaxel or with untargeted nanoparticle (nanoparticleRILGGR) provided no significant tumor growth delay when
compared with radiation alone (Fig. 6A). Similarly, in the
GL261 group, tumor tripling time was significantly delayed
by 12 days by nanoparticle-targeted peptide with XRT treatment (P < 0.005); however, all other treatment groups failed to
significantly delay tumor tripling time compared with untreated controls (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
We began designing our targeted DDS by seeking peptides
capable of recognizing irradiated cancer cells. Using a previ-

4556

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

ously characterized in vivo biopanning method (6, 7, 13, 14),
we discovered several candidate peptides (Fig. 1A). One of
the candidates, GIRLRG, proved to be specific to irradiated
cancer cells capable of interacting with tumor vascular endothelial cells in vitro (Fig. 1B) and tumors ex vivo and in vivo
(Fig. 1C and D). For the GIRLRG peptide to be of clinical utility for targeted therapy, its receptor must not be a ubiquitously expressed surface protein. XRT provides an intense
cellular stress, causing activation of DNA damage repair cascades and endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways (15).
Therefore, we hypothesized that the receptor for GIRLRG
could potentially be involved in one of these stress pathways
and be induced by XRT.
We sought to find this receptor using GL261 tumor
membrane protein affinity purification with GIRLRG. The
receptor identified for GIRLRG is GRP78 (Fig. 2A). GRP78 is

known as an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone involved
in suppression of stress-induced apoptosis (16) but can exist
as a cell surface protein to transduce extracellular stimuli
to intracellular signals to promote tumorigenesis (17–19).
Signaling through cell surface GRP78 increases cytosolic
calcium concentration, Akt phosphorylation, IP3, and
NF-κB, leading to an increase in DNA and protein synthesis
as well as cellular proliferation (19). A breadth of research
supports the correlation of GRP78 to higher pathologic
grade, metastasis, chemotherapeutic response, cancer prognosis, and patient survival in gliomas and breast carcinomas
(16, 18, 20–23). Importantly for clinical translation, GRP78
is expressed at much higher levels in a variety of tumors
and tumor vasculature compared with much lower levels
in normal tissues and non–tumor-bearing vasculature
where expression potentially increases during tissue
inflammation (17, 18, 20, 21, 23–25). This “natural” gradient

of GRP78 expression between tumor vasculature and non–
tumor-bearing vasculature is consistent with our in vitro
data of GIRLRG selectively binding only to irradiated HUVECs incubated with cancer cells, not to HUVECs alone
(Fig. 1B).
The discovery that GRP78 is upregulated at the cell surface
in XRT-treated tumors and tumor vasculature (Fig. 2) may
be a further indicator of its role in the cellular stress response, and in the ability of a cancer cell to escape stressors
that would lead a normal cell to apoptosis (16, 20–23). The
mechanism by which GRP78 translocates to the cell surface
is not fully understood, but hypotheses include particular
mechanisms adapted by cancer cells, oversaturation of the
endoplasmic reticulum retention system, transmembrane cycling of endoplasmic reticulum GRP78 to the cell surface, and
cotrafficking with cell surface client proteins (21). Because
GRP78 is expressed at the cell surface of tumors but not

MDA-MB-231 (A) or GL261 (B) tumors were
implanted in the hind limbs of nude mice or
C57/Bl6, respectively. Once tumors reached
300 mm3 in volume, mice were treated with
3 Gy XRT daily for 3 days, or were left as
untreated controls. On the 2nd day, mice
were injected with either systemic paclitaxel,
nanoparticle-RILGGR scrambled peptide, or
nanoparticle-GIRLRG targeted peptide at a
concentration of 10 mg/kg (five mice per
treatment group) (A) or 20 mg/kg (three mice per
treatment group) (B). Tumor volumes were
monitored throughout using calipers.

normal organs, cell surface GRP78 has become an attractive
strategy for targeted therapy (21). Ligand peptides for GRP78
are rapidly internalized through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (26). Previously, GRP78 targeting peptides linked with
paclitaxel (27, 28), doxorubicin (28), or proapoptotic peptides
(26) have been shown to induce melanoma cell death in vitro.
Once weekly systemic administration over 4 weeks of proapoptotic chimeric peptides fused to GRP78 binding motifs
suppressed tumor growth in xenograft models without affecting normal organs (17). Nonetheless, these observations
have not been approved for clinical use.
Having discovered a receptor induced by XRT, we sought
to use nanoparticle technology to deliver a paclitaxel drug
payload using GIRLRG as a targeting molecule for GRP78.
We postulated that conjugating the GIRLRG recombinant
peptide with a nanoparticle DDS capable of controlled pharmacokinetics could target chemotherapeutics specifically to
radiated tumors. In addition, the control over particle sizes
has been recognized to be crucial to predict the interaction
with cells and other biological barriers (29) and reduce the
risk of undesired clearance from the body through the liver
or spleen (30). Therefore, the nanoparticle we used applies
an intermolecular cross-linking technique (31) that not only
allows for predetermined nanoparticle dimensions with SDs
of 10% but also provides adjustable cross-linking densities to
control the degradation of the particles and allows for postmodification reactions with bioactive groups such as the
targeting peptide. The adjustable cross-linking densities of
the nanoparticle-targeting peptide complex can be applied
toward the controlled and sustained release of paclitaxel.
Consistent with the nanoparticle biodegradation profile
(12, 31), paclitaxel was found in significantly greater concentrations in our MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenografted mice
in the targeted nanoparticle group with the use of XRT over
all other treatment groups at 1 and 3 weeks (P < 0.05; Fig. 5A
and B). Similarly, TUNEL staining for apoptosis at both
1 and 3 weeks were greatly increased, indicating that the
nanoparticle-GIRLRG DDS was superior to radiation and
systemic paclitaxel in maintaining persistent cytotoxicity
(P < 0.05; Fig. 5C and D). Our data support the model that
the GIRLRG peptide is able to achieve significant targeting
of paclitaxel to the tumor (Fig. 5A and B) when there is high
expression of GRP78 at the surface, which can be induced in
tumors with XRT (Fig. 2).
Our primary outcome to determine the overall efficacy of
our novel targeting nanoparticle DDS was to assess tumor
volume tripling time in both human tumor cell lines and
in syngeneic mouse tumors. Our results showed that
MDA-MB-231 tumor tripling time was delayed 55 days with
the nanoparticle-targeted peptide with XRT (P = 0.0001),
compared with 11 to 14 days by the three other XRT
treatment groups (P < 0.05; Fig. 6A). Both unirradiated nanoparticle groups provided no significant tumor growth
delay when compared with the untreated control, suggesting
that even the nanoparticle-GIRLRG complex itself is not
adequately targeted in unirradiated tumors. The administration of radiation with systemic paclitaxel or with untargeted nanoparticle (nanoparticle-RILGGR) provided no

4558

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

significant tumor growth delay when compared with radiation alone (Fig. 6A), suggesting that the nanoparticle itself
(nanoparticle-RILGGR) does not target irradiated tumors.
Similarly, in the GL261 group, tumor tripling time was significantly delayed by 12 days by nanoparticle-targeted peptide
with XRT treatment (P < 0.005); however, all other treatment
groups failed to significantly delay tumor tripling time
compared with untreated controls (Fig. 6B). Thus, a single
administration of the targeted nanoparticle DDS achieved
tumor growth delay in irradiated tumors that was significantly greater than conventional systemic chemotherapy
and radiation.
In conclusion, our results indicate that administration of
XRT to tumors and tumor vasculature causes migration of
GRP78 to the cell surface where the nanoparticle-GIRLRG
DDS specifically delivers paclitaxel to the radiated site. By
combining the controllable, sustained drug release of the nanoparticle with the newly identified GIRLRG targeting peptide, we were able to specifically target chemotherapeutics
directly to an XRT-inducible receptor causing significant tumor cell death. The receptor identified for the peptide,
GRP78, is an ideal target for our nanoparticle-peptide DDS
because it is inducible by XRT (Fig. 2). Even after a single
administration of the nanoparticle-GIRLRG complex, paclitaxel can be detected in radiated tumors after 3 weeks, which
translates into significantly increased levels of apoptosis and
tumor growth delay (Figs. 5 and 6). Thus, we have used novel
nanotechnology in vivo to produce a significant increase in
the efficacy of cancer treatment over current clinical models.
We expect our targeted nanoparticle DDS to have clinical
utility, and with further investigation hope to implement
our system into clinical trials.
