Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Tumours progress despite being infiltrated by tumour-specific effector T cells1. Tumours contain
areas of cellular necrosis, which is associated with poor survival in a variety of cancers2. Here, we
show that necrosis releases an intracellular ion, potassium, into the extracellular fluid of mouse
and human tumours causing profound suppression of T cell effector function. We find that
elevations in the extracellular potassium concentration [K+]e act to impair T cell receptor (TCR)driven Akt-mTOR phosphorylation and effector programmes, this potassium-mediated
suppression of Akt-mTOR signalling and T cell function is dependent upon the activity of the
serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A3,4. While the suppressive effect mediated by elevated [K+]e is
independent of changes in plasma membrane potential (Vm), it does require an increase in
intracellular potassium ([K+]i). Concordantly, ionic reprogramming of tumour-specific T cells
through overexpression of the potassium channel Kv1.3 lowers [K+]i and improves effector

clearance and survival of melanoma-bearing mice. These results uncover a previously undescribed
ionic checkpoint blocking T cell function within tumours and identify new strategies for cancer
immunotherapy.

The tumour microenvironment is characterized in part by rapidly dividing cancer cells
competing for limited local resources5,6. These factors cause dense areas of cellular
apoptosis and necrosis 2. Tumour necrosis is frequently associated with a poor prognosis2,
an observation thought to be an epiphenomenon of aggressive underlying cancer biology.
However, cellular necrosis is also known to alter the extracellular milieu and has been
associated with the release of intracellular ions7 8. While tumour-specific T lymphocytes
harbour reactivity against tumour antigens9, their function is often suppressed within
tumours1. Whether local necrosis or consequent ionic derangement contributes to T cell
dysfunction within tumours is unknown.
Multiple lines of investigation have demonstrated that intact ion transport is required for T
cell function. Germline ablation of store-operated Ca2+efflux (SOCE) results in severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in humans10. Moreover, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
are essential for T cell function and survival11 and mutations in the Mg2+ channel MAGT1
lead to human T cell immunodeficiency12. Moreover, overabundance of Na+ and Clpromotes T cell pathogenicity and autoimmunity via the kinase SGK-113. Despite ions
playing a key role in T cell function, their extracellular concentrations and consequence
within tumours are poorly characterised.

We hypothesized that tumour cell death leads to a local ionic imbalance within the tumour
microenvironment. To isolate native undiluted extracellular fluid within tumours, hereinafter
tumour interstitial fluid (TIF), we utilized a centrifugation method14 as previously
described6,15. This enabled us to compare the concentration of 5 principal ions within TIF
of murine B16 melanoma or human tumours to that within serum. The concentration of
potassium ([K+]) in TIF was elevated compared to serum within both murine and human
tumours (Fig. 1a,b and Extended Data 1a) but not in extracellular fluid isolated from healthy
tissues (Extended Data 1b). We also observed a correlation between TIF [K+] and the
density of dying cells within murine B16 tumours (Fig. 1c). Additionally, experimental
induction of cell death or apoptosis in tumour-derived cell lines increased extracellular
potassium concentration ([K+]e) (Fig. 1d and Extended Data 1c,d). Thus, we conclude that
the extracellular space within tumours contains elevated [K+]e that is associated with local
cellular apoptosis and necrosis.
We next asked whether elevated [K+]e affects T cell function. We found a striking dosedependent suppression of TCR-induced cytokine production by isotonic elevations in [K+]e
(Fig. 1e,f). Elevated [K+]e acted independent of tonicity, with other monovalent and divalent
ions or inert osmolytes failing to induce similar suppression (Fig 1f,g and Extended Data 1eh). Elevated [K+]e functioned to acutely suppress T cell activation across a range of signal
strengths (Extended Data 1i), in the presence or absence of co-stimulation (Extended Data
1j), in a non-redundant fashion to tumour-associated co-inhibitory signals (Fig. 1h,i and
Extended Data 2a-b), in CD4+ TH1 and TH17 effector subtypes (Extended Data 2c,d), and

had no effect on cellular viability (Extended Data 2e). We next isolated endogenous human
neoantigen-specific TIL, identified as likely mediators of immunotherapy-induced tumour
clearance9,16, and found IFN-γ production by these cells in response to their cognate
neoepitope to be significantly attenuated by elevated [K+]e (Fig. 1j and Extended Data 2f,g).
Elevated [K+]e also led to suppression of target-specific IFN-γ production by T cells
genetically engineered with a cancer-germline antigen specific TCR17(Extended Data 2h).
Thus, our data suggests that elevated [K+]e acutely limits the function of mouse and human
T cells.
To understand the basis for this suppression of effector function, we explored the effect of
elevated [K+]e on the molecular events driven by TCR engagement. To this end, we briefly
activated FACS-purified murine CD8+ T cells in the presence or absence of elevated
potassium and found that elevated [K+]e significantly restrained the expression of transcripts
induced by TCR stimulation (Fig. 2a,b). Furthermore, gene-set enrichment analysis
indicated that elevated [K+]e suppressed genes induced by TCR signalling, NF-κB
activation, escape from anergy, adaptive immune response, and cytokine pathways
(Supplementary Information 1). Collectively, these data suggest that intratumoural cell death
produces elevated [K+]e concentrations which act to suppress TCR-driven effector
programmes.

The observation that elevated [K+]e acutely suppressed TCR-driven transcriptional events
led us to ask whether [K+]e could affect TCR-induced signal transduction pathways. Given
the role of [K+]e in regulating plasma membrane potential18,19, we initially hypothesized
that K+ acted to suppress TCR activation via induction of cellular membrane depolarization
(increased Vm) with subsequent dissipation of the electromotive force driving Ca2+ entry.
However, we could not detect any changes in TCR-induced Ca2+ flux in the presence of
isotonic elevations in [K+]e employed in our experiments (40mM) (Fig. 2c and Extended
Data 3a). Additionally, elevated [K+]e did not affect the phosphorylation of Zap70, Erk1/2,
PLCγ1, or global tyrosine phosphorylation following TCR ligation (Fig. 2d and Extended
Data 3b-c). However, elevated [K+]e did reduce TCR-induced phosphorylation of Akt and
serine/threonine residues targeted by Akt (Fig. 2e-g and Extended Data 3d), including
mTOR and the ribosomal protein S6 (Fig. 2f,g and Extended Data 3d). Suppression of AktmTOR signalling by elevated [K+]e was appreciable at later time points (Extended Data 3e),
not recapitulated by other osmolytes (Extended Data 4a), and apparent in conditions of
hypertonic hyperkalaemia (Extended Data 4b). Consistent with a role in limiting Akt-mTOR
activity20, elevated [K+]e inhibited TCR-induced nutrient consumption, (Extended Data
4c,d), CD4+ polarization to effector-lineages (Extended Data 4e,f), and promoted the
induction of Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells (Extended Data 4g). Taken together, we conclude that
elevated [K+]e limits TCR-driven effector function via suppression of the Akt-mTOR
pathway.
We next aimed to determine how elevated [K+]e suppresses TCR-induced Akt-mTOR
phosphorylation. First, we hypothesised that elevated [K+]e inhibits PI3K activity. However,
elevated [K+]e had no effect on TCR-induced PIP3 accumulation, (Fig. 2h), indicating that
K+-mediated suppression of Akt signalling was downstream of PI3K activation. Regulation
of Akt activity downstream of PI3K is carried out, in part, by serine/threonine phosphatases.

To interrogate cytokine production in the presence of elevated [K+]e we used a
pharmacologic screening approach to determine whether selected compounds, including
inhibitors of cellular phosphatases, might restore effector function in the presence of
elevated [K+]e. Phosphatase-inhibitors contained within the screen are depicted in Fig. 3a.
Notably, okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of the serine/threonine phosphatase PP2A21,
significantly restored T cell function in the presence of elevated [K+]e.
Moreover, OA reversed the hypophosphorylation of Akt and S6 caused by elevated [K+]e
(Fig. 3b and Extended Data 5a) in addition to restoring effector function (Fig. 3c and
Extended Data 5b). Similarly, genetic disruption of PP2A function, via overexpression of a
dominant negative isoform (PP2A_DN) or by short-hairpin mediated RNA interference
against the PP2A subunit Ppp2r2d similarly rescued effector function in the presence of
elevated [K+]e (Fig. 3c, Extended Data. 5c and 5d). Consistent with the mechanistic
involvement of Akt-mTOR hypophosphorylation in the suppression of effector function
mediated by elevated [K+]e, we found that T cells expressing a constitutively active form of
Akt (Akt1-CA) exhibited resistance to the inhibitory effects of high [K+]e (Fig. 3c and
Extended Data 5e). Thus, we conclude that elevations in [K+]e drive hypophosphorylation of
the Akt-mTOR pathway in a PP2A-dependent manner.
We next aimed to determine the intracellular changes responsible for decreased Akt-mTOR
phosphorylation and cytokine production in the presence of elevated [K+]e.

As potassium is the principal determinant of resting plasma membrane potential (Vm)18,19,
we first asked whether increased Vm in the presence of elevated [K+]e provided the source
of T cell suppression (Fig. 3d,e). To this end we tested whether modulation of Vm by other
means in the presence of low [K+]e would result in analogous suppression of T cell function.
We treated cells with the ionophore gramicidin, which increases Vm by forming pores in the
plasma membrane permeable to both sodium and potassium (Fig. 3f-h). However, as
gramicidin, in contrast to elevated [K+]e, increased IFN-γ production (Fig. 3i), we reasoned
that suppression of T cell function by high [K+]e is independent of its effect on Vm and
rather depends upon the concentration of intracellular potassium ([K+]i). Consistent with
this hypothesis, elevated [K+]e raised [K+]i while gramicidin depleted [K+]i and reversed the
suppressive effect induced by high [K+]e (Fig. 3j-m and Extended Data 6a-c). Additionally,
other pharmacologic conditions that depleted intracellular K+ led to rescue of T cell function
in the presence of elevated [K+]e (Fig. 3m and Extended Data 6d-k). Consistent with results
in other cell types, we quantified the baseline [K+]i of T cells as 133.8 mM±3.3. Additions
of 20 to 40 mM [K+]e increased [K+]i to 143 mM±4.5 and 153.2 mM±4.4, respectively
(Extended Data 7a,b). While T cells chronically exposed to elevated [K+]e responded
similarly to subsequent [K+]e changes as those cultured in control conditions (Extended
Data 7c-f), brief exposure to ouabain, a pharmacologic agent that inhibits the Na+, K+ ATPase, partially reversed elevations in [K+]i and T cell suppression in the presence of high
[K+]e (Fig. 3m and Extended Data 6h-k). Taken together, these data suggest that elevated
[K+]i in the presence of elevated extracellular concentrations may result from a combination
of augmented Na+, K+ - ATPase function and a relative decrease in potassium ion flow per
channel as the dynamically equilibrated chemical gradient between the intracellular and
extracellular space, and the absolute reversal potential for potassium, is attenuated.

Collectively, our findings suggested that enhancing T cell potassium efflux might increase T
cell anti-tumour function. Prior investigations of T cell-intrinsic potassium transport,
focusing on the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 (Kcna3) and the calcium-gated
potassium channel KCa3.1 (Kcnn4), have described dynamic regulation of potassium
transport in association with T cell activation and differentiation state22,23. Brief restimulation of CD8+ effector cells in vitro (Fig. 2b) revealed acute upregulation of Kcna3
mRNA in addition to dynamic expression of transcripts encoding potassium channels,
pumps, and regulatory subunits (Supplementary Information 2). Due to its TCR-induced
expression and previously described role in T cell function24, we hypothesized that enforced
expression of Kcna3 may increase potassium efflux with a resultant increase in
intratumoural T cell effector function. Indeed, we found that overexpression of Kcna3
(Figure 4a,b) resulted in lower T cell [K+]i (Extended Data 8a) and imparted resistance to
elevated [K+]e-mediated suppression (Extended Data 8b). Overexpression or pharmacologic
activation of KCa3.1 produced a similar gain-of-function and resistance to K+ mediated
suppression (Extended Data 8c-d).
To test whether augmented potassium efflux improved T cell function in vivo, we transferred
TCR-transgenic Pmel-1 CD8+ T cells transduced with Kcna3, or a control retroviral
construct, into B16 tumour-bearing mice. First, we noted that Kcna3 overexpression in TIL
increased Akt-mTOR activation (Fig. 4c) and IFN-γ production within tumours (Fig. 4d)
and following brief re-stimulation ex vivo (Extended Data 8e), without affecting T cell
phenotype or number in response to viral infection (Extended Data 8f-g).

To extend our observations, we tested whether human TILs from multiple cancer types were
supressed by elevated [K+]e, or alternative treatments that increase [K+]i, in a PP2A
dependent manner. Consistently, we found that either elevated [K+]e or inhibition of
endogenous potassium channels with Ba2+ increased [K+]i and suppressed effector function
in a manner that also required intact PP2A function in human TILs (Fig. 4e and Extended
Data 9a,b).
To test whether the gain-of-function observed as a result of Kcna3 overexpression resulted
from increased ion transport, we generated a non-conducting “pore dead” construct
(Kcna3_PD; W389F)25. Kcna3_PD failed to alter [K+]i, cytokine production in vitro (Fig.
4f,g and Extended Data 9c), or effector function of transduced TILs (Extended Data 9d).
Moreover, only intact Kcna3 resulted in enhanced tumour clearance and host survival (Fig.
4h,i). Collectively, these results indicate that augmenting cellular potassium efflux can
provide a means to increase the function of adoptively transferred T cells in tumours.
In this study, we have found that cell death within tumours is associated with elevated [K+]e
at a level that leads to increased [K+]i within T cells, silencing of TCR-induced Akt-mTOR
phosphorylation and decreased T cell effector function. While intact PP2A function was
required for K+ mediated suppression of T cell function, K+ did not directly affect PP2A
phosphatase activity (Extended Data 9e,f), implicating a functional intermediate.
Interestingly, investigations into the function of PP2A have identified several endogenous
small molecules and metabolites that can variably affect PP2A to increase or decrease its
contextual function26,27. Future experiments will aim to define if [K+]i alters the

processing, localization, or abundance of metabolites that affect PP2A activity. These
findings may also shed light on prior observations that changes in [K+]i regulate
inflammasome activation in macrophages28 and can control cellular peptide and
phospholipid processing29,30.

Finally, we found that elevated [K+]e suppresses T cell effector function and that antitumour T cells reprogrammed to express the potassium transporter Kcna3 exhibited lower
[K+]i and mediated enhanced effector function in vitro and in vivo. These data identify a
novel tumour-induced ionic checkpoint acting upon T cell effector function (Extended Data
10a-c) and that manipulating the intracellular ion concentration of anti-tumour T cells can
augment disease clearance, with implications for immune-based therapies for cancer.

Unless otherwise indicated, re-activation of cells in elevated concentrations of potassium

potassium for mouse cells and 50 mM for human cells in comparison to the control
condition media. In principal this media was produced by obtaining a custom formulation of
RPI 1640 from Gibco that was devoid of NaCl. For control conditions, this media was
reconstituted with NaCl to produce a solution equimolar to standard RPMI. Thus, the final
inorganic salt concentrations for the control condition was identical to that in RPMI 1640

0.4. For isotonic media containing an additional 40 mM KCl, this media was reconstituted
with a combination of NaCl and KCl such that the final inorganic salt concentrations, again
in mM, were: NaCl 63.4, NaHC03 23.8, Na2PO4 5.6, KCl 45.3, MgSO4 0.4, Ca(NO3)2) 0.4.
For 40 mM hypertonic NaCl the final inorganic salt concentrations were, in mM: NaCl

23.8, Na2HPO4 5.6, KCl 5.3, MgSO4 0.4, Ca(NO3)2) 0.4. All other additives in RPMI 1640

T cell TCR-induced Ca2+ was carried out in a combination of NaCl deplete RPMI 1640
reconstituted with NaCl or KCl and HBSS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ and without phenol red

In vitro activation of T cells was carried out either by negative enrichment (Miltenyi) of
CD8+ T cells from C57BL/6 mice followed by activation using using immobilized anti-CD3
(145-2C11; eBioscience) and anti-CD28 (37-51; eBioscience) along with expansion in
culture medium containing IL-2 for 4-5 days, or via isolation of Pmel-1 Ly5.1 murine whole
splenocytes followed by stimulation in vitro with 1 μM hgp10025–33 peptide and expansion
in culture medium containing IL-2 for 4-5 days. For analysis of T cell effector function,
these cells were then stimulated on day 4 or 5 of culture in the indicated conditions for 5
hours with anti-CD3 and CD28 without IL-2 in the presence of brefeldin-A and monesin
(BD Biosciences). For assaying co-inhibitory signalling, PD-L1 based co-inhibition PD-L1IgG2a (R&D) was conjugated along with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (eBioscience)
and control IgG2a (R&D) onto M-450 Epoxy Dynabeads (ThermoFisher) at a ratio of (1 :
1 : 2 : 6) for (anti-CD3 : anti-CD28 : PD-L1-IgG2a : IgG2a) for a total of 5 µg mL-1 protein
per 2 x 106 beads overnight at 4°C. For comparative control conditions IgG2a was replaced
for PD-L1 to control for bead loading. These beads were then incubated with effector CD8+
T cells at a ratio of 1:1 in the indicated conditions for 5 hours. For CTLA-4 based coinhibition, anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and CTLA-4-IgG2a (R&D) or IgG2a (R&D) were coated
onto tissue culture treated 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 µg mL-1 (in a fashion
similar to standard immobilized antibody based stimulation) for each reagent overnight at
4°C. For assaying neoantigen specific reactivity, human TIL from NCI-14-C-0062,
generated as described in section below, were re-activated for 5 hours with autologous preactivated B-cells that were pulsed with the indicated wild-type or neo-antigen peptides as

tumour fragments cultured in 6000 IU mL-1 IL-2 in 1 to 1 mixture of RPMI 1640 and AIMV, supplemented with 5% in-house human serum, penicillin and 100 µg mL-1streptomycin, 2

RNA purification, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, RNA-sequencing and bioinformatic
analysis

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

RNA sequencing was performed and analysed as described previously35. CD8+62L+
C57BL/6 splenocytes were FACS sorted from 6-8 week old mice in biological triplicate and
activated with anti-CD3 and CD28 for 48 hours in IL-2 100 IU mL-1 and cultured in RPMI
complete media for an additional 72 hours. Cells were then subjected to ficoll density
separation to isolate live cells, placed in complete media without IL-2 in the presence or
absence of elevated [K+]e, and either re-stimulated with anti-CD3 and CD28 or kept in
complete media for two hours with no stimulation (No stim). Cellular RNA was preserved
with RNAlater (Qiagen) and purified with the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia,
CA). RNA was subsequently used to prepare RNA-seq libraries by using TruSeq SRRNA
sample prep kit (FC-122-1001, Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
libraries were sequenced for 150bp (paired-end) using a NextSeq500 sequencer (Illumina).
Sequence reads from each cDNA library were mapped onto the mouse genome build mm9
by using Tophat, and the mapped data was then processed by Cufflinks36. The obtained data
was normalized based on RPKM (reads per kilobase exon model per million mapped reads).
To define differentially regulated genes, we used a 1.5-fold change difference between
treatment groups. Real-time RT-PCR was performed for genes following cDNA generation
by reverse transcription (Applied Biosystems) with primers from Applied Biosystems by
Prism 7900HT (Applied Biosystems). RNA-sequencing raw data files are deposited at GEOGSE84996.
Extracellular Acidification Rate and Basal Oxygen Consumption Rate
OCR and ECAR were measured following re-stimulation of T cells using anti-CD3/28
Dynabeads (Invitrogen) in a 0.8:1 ratio at 37°C using an XF24 extracellular analyzer
(Seahorse Bioscience) as previously described37 in the indicated conditions. Oxygen
consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) were measured in XF
media (nonbuffered RPMI 1640 containing 25 mM glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mM
sodium pyruvate) in a 1:1 mixture with tonicity controlled additive free standard RPMI 1640
with normal or elevated [K+] under basal conditions and in response to 1 μM oligomycin, 2
μM fluoro-carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP), or 100 nM rotenone with 1 μM
antimycin A (Sigma).
Intracellular Cytokine Staining, PhosFlow, and flow cytometry

azide). For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were stained for intracellular molecules
following fixation and permeabilization. For phosphostaining BD PhosFlow reagents were
utilized and fixation/permeabilization protocols were carried according the to
manufacturer’s protocol. After washing, cells were stained with antibody-fluorochrome
conjugates for the indicated phosphorylated proteins (pZap70Y319 (BD Biosciences), all
other phospho-antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling). Antibodies for surface
staining and intracellular cytokine staining were purchased from BD Biosciences and
eBiosciences. For determination of cytoplasmic membrane potential (Vm) cells were
incubated in 2uM DiSBAC43 (Invitrogen) in conditions as indicated for 60 minutes prior to
evaluation. For determination of [K+]i, cells were loaded with the potassium sensitive dye
Asante Green-4 (TEFLabs) with PowerLoad (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer’s protocols.
All experiments were conducted on a BD Fortessa flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and
analyzed with FlowJo software.
Identification and purification of mutation specific tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Cancer specific mutations and TIL targeted against those mutations from patients with
metastatic melanoma were identified as previously described38. Briefly, patients were
enrolled on a clinical protocol (NCI-14-C-0062). Whole-exomic sequencing (WES) was
performed on tumour tissue and normal peripheral blood cells by Personal Genome
Diagnostics (PGDx, Baltimore, MD) and the data was aligned to genome build hg18. A
viable metastatic tumour deposit was selected for resection as a source for TIL. The resected
en-bloc tumour was subjected to mechanical disruption via the GenlteMACS Dissociator.
The bulk tumour digest was cultured in complete media without IL-2 or other cytokines
overnight. The following day CD3+PD-1+ T cells were FACS sorted using a BD Jazz Flow
cytometer. These sorted T cells were then subjected to a rapid expansion protocol (REP)
using irradiated PBMC at a ratio of 1 to 300 in 50/50 medium (1 to 1 mixture of RPMI 1640
and AIM-V, supplemented with 5% in-house human serum, 100 U mL-1penicillin and 100
µg mL-1streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 10 µg mL-1gentamicin), 3000 IU mL-1of IL-2,
and 30 ng mL-1of OKT3 antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) for approximately 14 days. At the
conclusion of the first REP T cells were screened and FACS sort enriched with the BD Jazz
sorter based on 41BB positivity38, against tandem mini-gene (TMG) constructs encoding
for tumour specific mutations identified by WES for each patient and tumour, as described
above and previously9,38,39. These enriched neo-antigen specific T cells were then
expanded via a second REP. At the conclusion of the second REP T cells were activated with
peptide pulsed (at 1 : 3; effector : target) autologous CD40L stimulated B-cells with either
10 µg mL-1 of the full length 23-mer mutated or wild peptide (Patient A) or 1 µg mL-1 of the
minimal epitope (Patient B,C) in the indicated conditions.
Retroviral transduction
Platinum-E ecotropic packaging cells (Cell Biolabs) were plated one day prior to
transfections on poly-D-lysine coated 10cm plates (Corning) at a concentration of 6x106
cells per plate. Packaging cells were transfected with 20µg of retroviral plasmid DNA
encoding MSGV-Thy1.1, MSGV-Kcna3-Thy1.1, MSGV-Kcna3-Thy1.1 (W389F) (referred
to as Kcna3_PD) 25, 40, MSGV-Ppp2r1a(K416E) -Thy1.1 (referred to as PP2A_DN41,42),

Eco plasmid DNA using 60µL Lipofectamine 2000 in OptiMEM (Invitrogen) for 8 hours in
antibiotic-free media. Media was replaced 8h after transfection and cells were incubated for
a further 48 hours. Retroviral supernatants were then collected and spun at 2000g for 2 h at
32°C onto 24 well non-tissue culture treated plates coated overnight in Retronectin (Takara
Bio). For in vivo experiments live cells were isolated via ficoll density separation
(Cedarlane) and subjected to positive-selection via CD90.1-microbead column enrichment
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Miltenyi) prior to transfer, yielding a CD8+ T cell
population 70-95% Thy1.1+ prior to transfer. For retroviral transduction of human PBL with
the NY-ESO-1 TCR, patients with metastatic melanoma on the clinical protocol NCI-13C-0214 were subjected to leukopheresis and their PBL were transduced with a MSGV1
backbone encoding the NY-ESO-1 murine derived TCR as previously described17. After
primary transduction and culture (10 days), these cells were then further expanded via a REP
as described above (days 10-23) and subsequently assayed for target-specific effector
function in the indicated conditions.
Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) and tumour immunotherapy

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

For immunotherapy, C57BL/6 were implanted with subcutaneous B16 melanoma (5 × 105
cells). At the time of ACT, 10 days after tumour implantation, mice (n ≥ 5 for all groups)
were sub-lethally irradiated (600 cGy), randomized, and injected intravenously with 5x10 5
Pmel-1 Ly5.1 cells transduced with control or Kcna3 expressing retrovirus, and received
intraperitoneal injections of IL-2 in PBS (6 × 104 IU/0.5 ml) once daily for 3 days starting
on the day of cell transfer. Tumours were blindly measured using digital callipers. Tumour
size was measured in a blinded fashion approximately every two days after transfer and
tumour area was calculated as length x width of the tumour. Mice with tumours greater than
400mm2 were euthanized. The products of the perpendicular tumour diameters are presented
as mean ± SEM at the indicated times after ACT. For functional analysis of transferred
Pmel-1cells, B16 tumour-bearing mice received Pmel-1 cells as above, and six to eight days
following cell transfer mice were injected with 500 uL of 0.5 mg mL-1 brefeldin-A (Sigma)
and six hours later tumours were harvested and processed for live/dead, surface, fixation,
and intracellular staining for direct in vivo IFN-γ capture44. For ex vivo restimulation,
tumours were harvested, processed as above, red cells were lysed with ACK lysis buffer for
2 min at room temperature, then cell suspensions were subjected to live-cell isolation via
ficoll density gradient separation (CedarLane) and stimulated in media containing Leukocyte
activation cocktail with Golgiplug (BD biosciences) for 4 h at a final concentration of 2 µL
mL-1.
Viral infection and kinetic analysis
For assessing the response of CD8+ T cells to acute viral infection, 5 × 105 transduced and
Thy1.1+ enriched Pmel-1 Ly5.1 CD8+ T cells were transferred into recipient Thy1.2 Ly5.2
C57BL/6 mice. Immediately following transfer, mice were infected with rhgp100 1 × 107
plaque-forming units (PFU). At the indicated time points following transfer recipient mouse
blood was obtained via sub-mandibular venipuncture and analysis for phenotype and
enumeration of the congenically identified transferred cells.

TCR crosslinking, western blots

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

As described previously45, to induce TCR crosslinking in vitro generated T cells were
rested overnight in the absence of IL-2, subjected to live cell isolation via ficoll density
gradient separation, pre-incubated with soluble anti-CD3 and anti-CD28-biotin, appropriate
surface antibodies, and pharmacologic inhibitors where indicated in additive free RPMI
1640 at 4°C. Cells were then washed, brought to 37°C, and stimulated via the addition of
streptavidin in the indicated conditions. For western blots, at the indicated time points
following cross-linking cells were lysed by the addition of 95°C 2x Laemmli sample buffer
with 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and sonicated for 40 seconds at 10%
intensity prior to gel loading. For Kv1.3 protein analysis, Thy1.1+ enriched T cells were
lysed in 1xRIPA buffer (Thermofischer) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche).
Western blotting was performed using TGX reagents (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and protocols
on PVDF paper. Following transfer blots were blocked with 5% BSA then incubated with
antibodies against phospho-Tyrosine (4G10; EMD Millipore), pAkt-T308, Total Akt, βactin, Akt-substrate, or phospho-Threonine with appropriate HRP-conjugated or Alexa 647conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Kv1.3 (NeuroMab). For
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies blots were developed using chemiluminescence
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), gel images were captured with the Gel Doc XRS (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). For PI3K activity, cells were fixed at the indicated time points by the 1:1
addition of a mixed lysis solution containing 30 mM HCl, 65% methanol, and 30%
chloroform, maintained at -80°C then processed and analysed as previously described46.
TCR induced Calcium Influx

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

T cells were isolated and primed as above. Prior to analysis cells were ‘rested’ in IL-2 free
complete RPMI 1640 for at least 8 hours. Cells were loaded with 1 μM Fluo3-AM and 1 μM
Fura Red-AM (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37°C in HBSS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ and 2% FCS,
washed twice and then resuspended in HBSS with anti-CD3 and CD28-biotin conjugates
(eBioscience) and live/dead (Invitrogen). For flow cytometry analysis, samples were
resuspended in pre-warmed 37°C 1:1 mixtures of HBSS and isotonic normokalemic or
hyperkalemic additive free RPMI (as described above in External Solution Formulations), a
baseline measurement was recorded for 20 seconds, followed by the addition of Streptavidin
(Invitrogen) to a final concentration of 20 µg mL-1 to induce TCR cross-linking and Ca2+
influx. Kinetic analyses were performed with the FlowJo software package (TreeStar).
shRNA mediated Ppp2r2d knockdown
A pLKO-Thy1.1 construct targeting Ppp2r2d was a generous gift of Dr.’s Zhou and
Wucherpfenning and lentiviral particles were generated per their protocol4. BM cells were

hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were enriched by autoMACS depletion of lineage
positive cells using the Lineage Cell Depletion Kit (Miltenyi) for BM cells. Negatively
selected cells were cultured in chemically defined serum free medium X-vivo 10 with
Gentamicin (Lonza) supplemented with L-glutamine (1x) (Gibco), beta-mercaptoethanol

Extended Data 10. Intratumoural inhibition of T cell effector function via an ionic checkpoint.

(a) Healthy tissue contains limited local cellular decay, maintaining the interstitial [K+]e
close to serum. T cells are robustly activated following TCR stimulation. (b) Tumour
intrinsic phenomena produce a high density of cell death within cancers. Cell death leads to
release of intracellular potassium into the extracellular space. The resultant elevated
extracellular [K+] acts to increase the intracellular [K+] of T cells, limiting their activation
and effector function. (c) Reduction of [K+]i and increased effector function can be imparted
to tumour-specific T cells by over-expression of the potassium channel Kv1.3 (Kcna3).
