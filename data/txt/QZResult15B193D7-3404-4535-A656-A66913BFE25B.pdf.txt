Controversies in Antiepidermal Growth Factor Receptor
Therapy in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer
Janghee Woo, MD, PhD1; Neil Palmisiano, MD2; William Tester, MD1,3; and John C. Leighton, Jr., MD1,3

The randomized first-line trials, including the CRYSTAL trial, the OPUS trial, and the PRIME trial, have demonstrated the significant
efficacy of cetuximab or panitumumab in patients with v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) wild-type
tumors. The addition of an antiepidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR)-directed monoclonal antibody to chemotherapy for
these patients significantly improved progression-free survival, response rates, and R0 resection rates to a greater extent than overall
survival compared with patients who received chemotherapy alone. However, 2 recent randomized phase 3 trials, the MRC COIN trial
and the Nordic VII trial, reported an unexpected lack of benefit from the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy in the first-line setting. In addition, recent retrospective analyses performed on a pooled data set from major clinical trials added more complexity,
reporting an unexpected association of KRAS G13D mutation with a better clinical outcome compared with patients who had other
KRAS mutations in the first-line and salvage settings, whereas the other independent analysis failed to demonstrate a benefit from
panitumumab in patients with the same KRAS G13D mutation. The anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody-associated skin toxicity and the
controversial strategies of management also are discussed. In this review, the authors analyze the previous randomized clinical trials
and more critically re-evaluate recent trials and subgroup analyses to derive 3 factors that need to be taken into consideration
regarding the addition of EGFR-directed monoclonal antibodies to chemotherapy: the preclinical data on mechanisms of action
between chemotherapy and anti-EGFR antibodies along with mechanisms of resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies, the role of crossover events in overall survival data, and the significant dose reductions of chemotherapeutic agents when combined with anti-EGFR

INTRODUCTION
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds extracellular proteins of the EGF family
and plays a critical role in oncogenesis. EGFR belongs to the ErbB family, which includes ErbB2 (human EGFR2
[HER2/neu]), ErbB3 (HER3), and ErbB4 (HER4). EGFR is a glycoprotein that contains 3 major components: an extracellular ligand binding domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain.1
Specific ligands for each of the ErbB family receptors interact with receptors that have different affinities. EGFR remains
in a state of autoinhibition in the absence of ligands like EGF and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFa). Ligand binding alters conformation of the protein and exposes the dimerization loop, which subsequently forms homodimers or heterodimers with other member of the ErbB family. Dimerization triggers the phosphorylation of tyrosine kinases in the
EGFR intraceullar domain, leading to subsequent activation in downstream signaling pathways.2 Because of its role in the
development and progression of colon cancer, EGFR has become an attractive target for therapy in the colorectal cancers
(CRCs).
Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody (immunoglobulin G1 [IgG1]) that competitively binds to the EGFR
extracellular domain with higher affinity than endogenous ligands. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that
binding of cetuximab to EGFR blocks phosphorylation and activation of the tyrosine kinase and subsequently inhibits
downstream signal transduction, resulting in inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis. Cetuximab can mediate
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against human tumor cells.1 Panitumumab is a fully human anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (IgG2) with high affinity to the EGFR, blocking ligand binding and inhibiting the subsequent activation
of downstream signaling pathways.3,4 Unlike cetuximab, panitumumab does not mediate antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity and less often results in infusion reactions and anaphylactic reactions than cetuximab, because panitumumab

is a fully humanized antibody.5 Multiple in vitro, in vivo,
and clinical trials have demonstrated that the efficacy of
anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies depends on lack of
v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog
(KRAS) mutation,6 although recent clinical and laboratory observations may challenge the current knowledge
and clinical implications of KRAS mutation and antiEGFR efficacy.7-9
These anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies have been
evaluated in patients with advanced CRC as first-line, second-line, or later lines of therapy and as either a single
agent or in combined chemotherapy. In this review, we
discuss the results from recent phase 3 randomized clinical
trials with cetuximab and panitumumab, and in particular, the controversial results from combined chemotherapy-cetuximab trials as first-line therapy in patients with
metastatic CRC (mCRC). In addition, recent subgroup

(PRIME) trials, have generated conflicting results.7,9 In
the current review, we discuss conflicting data and discrepancies with preclinical data.10 Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (MoAB)-associated skin toxicity and
management strategies also are discussed. Table 1 summarizes the major clinical trials with cetuximab and
panitumumab.
Earlier Trials of Anti-EGFR Agents

The first phase 1 clinical trial with cetuximab24 demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity in epithelial
tumors and established the dosing regimen of cetuximab
400 mg/m2 as a loading dose followed by 250 mg/m2
weekly. Subsequent phase 2 trials demonstrated the efficacy of cetuximab in patients with advanced CRC.25,26
In a phase 3 randomized trial of 572 patients who had
failed all prior therapies, cetuximab monotherapy was
compared with best supportive care (BSC).3 The median
overall survival (OS) was significantly better with cetuximab (6.1 months vs 4.6 months; hazard ratio [HR],
0.77; P ¼ .005) in that study, in which no crossover
between arms was allowed. A subsequent analysis demonstrated that the benefits of cetuximab were restricted
to patients whose tumors carried KRAS wild-type alleles.
Among patients who had mutated KRAS, there was no
1942

significant difference between cetuximab and BSC in
terms of OS (KRAS wild type: 9.5 months vs 4.8
months; HR, 0.55; P < .001; KRAS mutation: 4.6
months vs 4.5; HR, 0.98; P ¼ .89) or progression-free
survival (PFS) (KRAS wild type: 3.7 months vs 1.9
month; HR, 0.40; P < .001; KRAS mutation: 1.8
months vs 1.8 months; HR, 0.99; P ¼ .96).11
An early phase clinical trial in panitumumab monotherapy was carried out on 148 patients with advanced
CRC who were refractory to standard chemotherapy, and
the investigators reported a 29% stable disease rate and a
9% partial response rate.27 Finally, a randomized phase 3
trial in panitumumab monotherapy was compared with
BSC in patients who had chemotherapy-refractory
mCRC, and a significant response rate (17% vs 0%) and
PFS advantages (12.3 weeks vs 7.3 weeks; HR, 0.45; P <
.0001) were reported.12 The lack of an OS difference was
probably because of panitumumab use after crossover in
the BSC group, of which 76% entered the crossover
study. A later post hoc analysis confirmed that efficacy
was limited to patients who did not carry a KRAS mutant
allele.13
After cetuximab monotherapy demonstrated efficacy in CRC, the Bevacizumab and Irinotecan Compared
With Cetuximab and Bevacizumab Alone in IrinotecanRefractory Colorectal Cancer (BOND) trial demonstrated that irinotecan plus cetuximab had significant efficacy compared with cetuximab alone in patients with
irinotecan-refractory mCRC, improving the response rate
(23% vs 11%) and PFS (4.1 months vs 1.5 months).25
The Erbitux Plus Irinotecan in Colorectal Cancer (EPIC)
trial further investigated oxaliplatin-refractory patients
who received second-line therapy with single-agent irinotecan with or without cetuximab.14 In that study, PFS was
significantly better with combined therapy (4 months vs
2.6 months) as was the response rate (16.4% vs 4.2%).
No significant OS benefit was observed, but nearly 50%
of patients in the irinotecan alone group received cetuximab after disease progression. It is noteworthy that the
trial analyzed all patients without KRAS mutation status.
Recently, panitumumab with combined 5-fluorouracil
(5FU), folinic acid, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) as secondline therapy was investigated in patients with mCRC who
were refractory to combined 5FU, folinic acid, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) compared with FOLFIRI alone.
Patients who had KRAS mutations also were included in
the final analysis. In patients who had KRAS wild-type
tumors, combined therapy was associated with significantly longer PFS (5.9 months vs 3.9 months) and a
higher response rate (35% vs 10%), and there was a trend

toward better median OS (14.5 months vs 12.5 months);
whereas patients who had KRAS mutated tumors failed to
demonstrate better efficacy with combined therapy.15
The trials described above demonstrated that the
anti-EGFR MoABs, either alone or with chemotherapy,
have efficacy as salvage therapy for heavily treated patients
who have mCRC and as second-line therapy with noncross-resistant chemotherapy for first-line chemorefractory patients. PFS and response benefits appeared to be
confined to KRAS wild-type tumors. In most of the aforementioned trials except CO.17 (cetuximab salvage therapy compared with BSC),11 in which crossover did not
occur, the benefits in terms of PFS and response rate have
yet to yield improved OS for patients with KRAS wildtype tumors. Because of significant crossover and subsequent treatment effects, the nature of these findings raises
questions regarding the best endpoint with which to evaluate the efficacy of the agent of interest. For example, in
the trial of panitumumab as salvage therapy, nearly half of
patients in the control group received panitumumab after
tumor progression, skewing OS data toward accepting the
null hypothesis. Hence, at this point, we believe that the
lack of an OS benefit demonstrated in cetuximab or panitumumab trials among patients with mCRC does not necessarily indicate the lack of clinical utility, and using these
agents as tested can be a reasonable choice.
Anti-EGFR Trials as First-Line Therapy

Three published randomized trials investigated use of
cetuximab or panitumumab in the setting of first-line
treatment with different chemotherapy backbones. The
CRYSTAL trial investigated cetuximab in combination
with FOLFIRI for patients with mCRC compared with
FOLFIRI alone.17 KRAS mutation status was determined
from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues retrospectively and was reported in a post hoc analysis. In the KRAS
wild-type group, the addition of cetuximab to FOLFIRI
significantly prolonged OS (23.5 months vs 20 months;
HR, 0.796; P ¼ .0093) and PFS (9.9 months vs 8.4
months; HR, 0.696; P ¼ .0012) and markedly increased
the response rate (57.3% vs 39.7%; odds ratio [OR],
2.069; P < .001) and the R0 resection rate (5.1% vs 2%;
OR, 2.650; P ¼ .0265). However, patients who had
KRAS mutant tumors failed to demonstrate efficacy in
any survival or response endpoints.17 In the United States,
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy has been used more commonly than irinotecan as first-line treatment. The phase 2
OPUS trial addressed the efficacy of cetuximab combined
with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (FOLFOX4) as
first-line therapy.19 In that trial, patients with KRAS
1944

wild-type tumors who received cetuximab plus FOLFOX4 had significantly prolonged PFS (8.3 months vs
7.2 months; HR, 0.567; P ¼ .0064) and exhibited better
response rates (57% vs 34%; OR, 2.551; P ¼ .0027) and
R0 resection rates (12% vs 3%; P ¼ .0242) with a trend
toward better OS (22.8 months vs 18.5 months; P ¼ .39).
The phase 3 PRIME trial20 also demonstrated efficacy for
panitumumab in combination with oxaliplatin-based
FOLFOX4 as first-line therapy. A PFS benefit was demonstrated in the KRAS wild-type panitumumab arm (9.6
months vs 8 months; HR, 0.80; P ¼ .02); whereas only a
trend toward better OS (23.9 months vs 19.7 months;
HR, 0.83; P ¼ .072), response rate (55% vs 48%; OR,
1.35; P ¼ .068) and R0 resection rate (8.3% vs 7.0%) was
observed in patients with KRAS wild-type tumors.20 The
Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 80203 trial of
first-line cetuximab plus either FOLFIRI or FOLFOX,
which was closed early when data on benefits of bevacizumab became available, reported a significantly higher
response rate (55% vs 32% for FOLFOX; 42% vs 34%
for FOLFIRI) in the cetuximab plus chemotherapy
arm.23 However, complete data from this trial have not
been published. It is noteworthy that the OPUS18,19 and
PRIME20 trials demonstrated that, in patients with KRAS
mutant tumors, the addition of an anti-EGFR MoAB to
chemotherapy produced a detrimental effect, which was
further confirmed in the second-line, phase 3 Panitumumab, Irinotecan, and Cyclosporin in Colorectal Cancer
Therapy (PICCOLO) trial.28 These results indicate that
anti-EGFR therapy should not be given to patients who
have CRC with KRAS mutations in any line of treatment.
Controversies in Recent First-Line
Cetuximab Trials

Recently 2 randomized phase 3 trials of cetuximab and
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy have raised more questions regarding efficacy of cetuximab in first line treatment. The Medical Research Council Continuous
Chemotherapy plus Cetuximab or Intermittent Chemotherapy with Standard Continuous Palliative Combination
Chemotherapy with Oxaliplatin and Fluoropyrimidine in
First-Line Treatment of Metastatic Cancer MRC COIN)
trials21 in the United Kingdom included 357 patients
with KRAS wild-type tumors in a cetuximab arm, including 117 patients who received infusional 5FU with oxaliplatin and 240 patients who received capecitabine with
oxaliplatin. The study investigators reported that OS (17.0
months vs 17.9 months; HR, 1.04; P ¼ .67) and PFS
(8.6 months vs 8.6 months; HR, 0.96; P ¼ .60) did not
differ between the cetuximab group and the control group,

Phase 3 Trials: KRAS and Skin Toxicity/Woo et al

although the response rate increased from 57% to 64% in
the cetuximab group (P ¼ .047). The authors argued that
the trial has not confirmed a benefit from the addition of
cetuximab to oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in first-line
treatment. However, a post hoc analysis has noted
improved PFS with cetuximab in patients who received
infusional 5FU-based therapy (HR, 0.72; P ¼ .037), but
not in those who received capecitabine-based therapy
(HR, 1.02; P ¼ .88). A further interaction analysis demonstrated that a PFS benefit was restricted to patients who
had KRAS wild-type tumors and no or only 1 metastatic
site treated with infusional 5FU-based therapy (HR, 0.55;
P ¼ .011).
Another recent phase 3 trial, Nordic VII,22 investigated the efficacy of cetuximab in addition to bolus 5FU/
folinic acid, and oxaliplatin (Nordic FLOX), which has
been used exclusively in the Scandinavian countries. The
Nordic FLOX regimen22 was administered every 2 weeks
with 5FU 500 mg/m2 as a bolus infusion (<5 minutes),
followed 30 minutes later by bolus leucovorin 60 mg/m2
(<10 minutes) on days 1 and 2, and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2
over 1 hour on day 1; whereas the American FLOX regimen, as reported in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast
and Bowel Project (NSABP) C-07 trial,29 is commonly
administered weekly as 2-hour intravenous leucovorin as a
500 mg/m2 infusion followed 1 hour later by a bolus 5FU
500 mg/m2 infusion and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 administered every 2 weeks as a 2-hour infusion before leucovorin
and 5FU. The Nordic VII trials included 194 patients
with KRAS wild-type tumors, 97 patients who received
Nordic FLOX, and 97 patients who received Nordic
FLOX with cetuximab. An additional 130 patients who
had KRAS mutant tumors also were randomized into the
control and interventional arms. In the patients with KRAS
wild-type tumors, PFS (7.9 months vs 8.7 months; HR,
1.07; P ¼ .66), OS (20.1 months vs 22 months; HR,
1.14; P ¼ .48), and the response rate (46% vs 47%; OR,
0.96; P ¼ .89) demonstrated an unexpected trend toward
a worse outcome at all endpoints measured. Conversely,
patients with KRAS mutant tumors had a trend toward
better prognosis when they received cetuximab, as indicated by their PFS (9.2 months vs 7.8 months; HR, 0.71;
P ¼ .07), OS (21.1 months vs 20.4 months; HR, 0.89;
P ¼ .89), and response rate (35% vs 23%; OR, 1.44; P ¼
.31). The trial investigators reached the conclusion that
cetuximab did not add significant benefit to the Nordic
FLOX regimen in first-line treatment.
Anti-EGFR therapy trials produced inconsistent
results in studies that combined cetuximab with first-line
oxaliplatin-based regimens, mainly depending on the
Cancer

chemotherapy backbones in first-line treatment, although
cetuximab or panitumumab had efficacy in second-line
treatment combined with chemotherapy and as singleagent salvage treatment. The significant benefit of cetuximab reported in the CRYSTAL trial contrasted with a
lack of benefit from the MRC COIN and NORDIC VII
trials. It was speculated that the chemotherapy back bones
could explain the difference, because irinotecan may be
more effective than oxaliplatin with cetuximab. However,
the PRIME and OPUS trials demonstrated a benefit from
EGFR-directed antibodies combined with FOLFOX4.
Preclinical data also support synergistic effects of cetuximab and oxaliplatin. In vitro, cetuximab combined with
oxaliplatin synergistically decreased the 50% inhibitory
concentration value of oxaliplatin in subsets of colon cancer cell lines, and the observed responses depended strictly
on the cell type. Response was not correlated with the level
of EGFR expression but was related to the basal level of
phospho-EGFR.30 The addition of cetuximab to oxaliplatin potentiated cytotoxic effects by stimulating oxaliplatin-DNA adduct formation, which is associated with
reduced expression of the key enzyme (excision repair
cross complementation group 1 [ERCC1]) in the main
repair process of oxaliplatin-DNA platinum adducts.31
The efficacy of combined cetuximab and oxaliplatin in
murine subcutaneous colon cancer xenograft models was
greater than that of monotherapy alone and was independent of the responsiveness to oxaliplatin monotherapy.30,32 Both studies31,32 independently observed that
cetuximab reduced the expression of ERCC1 and XPF
(xeroderma pigmentosum), which are key components of
the nucleotide excision repair pathway involved in the
excision of platinum-DNA adducts.
The COIN trial provided another interesting observation that patients who received cetuximab with bolus
and infusional 5FU (mFOLFOX6) had a significant benefit in terms of PFS (HR, 0.72; P ¼ .037), whereas
patients who received cetuximab with capecitabine-based
therapy (XELOX) failed to demonstrate a benefit. The
total number of patients who received XELOX (240
patients) far exceeded the total number of patient who
received FOLFOX (117 patients) in that trial, which may
have contributed to the discrepancies in outcomes and,
ultimately, the negative outcomes. This pattern also was
observed in the Nordic VII trial, in which all patients
received a bolus-only 5FU and leucovorin regimen with
oxaliplatin and cetuximab. We learned from those trials,
including OPUS, that cetuximab demonstrated better efficacy with an infusional 5FU regimen (FOLFOX) when
combined with oxaliplatin. Of note, the mode of 5FU
1945

Review Article

administration was not an issue with irinotecan regimens,
because infusional 5FU (FOLFIRI) clearly offered superior activity to bolus 5FU (mIFL) and capecitabine
(CapeIRI) with better toxicity profiles in mCRCs33; and
the CRYSTAL trial17 demonstrated the significant benefit
of cetuximab with FOLFIRI compared with FOLFIRI
alone. These observations suggest that cetuximab would
work more effectively with infusional 5FU than with
bolus 5FU alone or capecitabine, but this has not been
formally explored. The data indicating the benefits of
oxaliplatin combined with panitumumab included the
infusional FOLFOX regimen. In vitro experiments with
colon cancer cell lines demonstrated different biochemical
responses between modes of 5FU administration. The
result suggested that incorporation of fluorouridine
triphosphate into RNA appears to be the most important
mechanism of action for 5FU bolus schedules, whereas
inhibition of thymidylate synthase becomes more important as the infusion time is prolonged.34 It is noteworthy
that multiple studies have demonstrated that anti-EGFR
agents, including cetuximab,35 erlotinib,36 and lapatinib,37 appear to down-regulate thymidylate synthase in
human colon cancer cells. The inhibition of thymidylate
synthase is mediated through down-regulation of EGFR
or inhibition of nuclear translocation of EGFR by antiEGFR agents. Therefore, preclinical data implicated that
there may be an unexpected, significant interaction
between cetuximab and the mode of 5FU application.
These in vitro differences consequently were reflected in
the clinical trials using different modes of 5FU administration. However, the development of a better preclinical
model is required to elucidate the molecular and biochemical interactions in anti-EGFR agents and current
chemotherapy.
In the first-line chemotherapy setting, as discussed
above in later line studies, benefits in PFS, response rates,
or resection rates with curative intent should not be
ignored because of a lack of benefit in OS, because OS
can be largely affected by subsequent therapy after the
trial. In particular, many patients in control arms received
the investigational agent later, and most patients ultimately received comparable numbers of total active agents
in subsequent lines of therapy. In the COIN trial, the OS
was similar in both arms (17.0 months vs 17.9 months;
HR, 1.04), although the authors did not report separate
OS for the XELOX and mFOLFOX6 groups. A statistically significant number of patients in the control arm
(P ¼ .0061) received more second-line treatment, which
may have affected OS. In the Nordic VII trial, a similar
number of patients in both arms received active therapeu1946

tic agents in the second-line or third-line, such as irinotecan, 5FU, or bevacizumab; whereas patients in the
control arm later received significantly more cetuximab
(12.4% in the treatment arm vs 27.2% in the control
arm), like what occurred in the panitumumab salvage
therapy trial.13 Given this consideration, the significant
PFS benefit demonstrated in the mFOLFOX6 plus cetuximab group from the COIN trial needs extra attention. A
carefully re-evaluated subgroup analysis may add evidence
that FOLFOX with cetuximab can have significant efficacy in first-line therapy.
The combination of cetuximab and chemotherapy
increased toxicity and adverse effects, mainly skin reactions,
diarrhea, and infusion-related reactions, compared with
chemotherapy alone. Of note, however, trials that have
demonstrated the efficacy of cetuximab have reported comparable median relative dose intensity and cumulative
doses of FOLFOX and FOLFIRI between control and
experimental arms.13,17,19 The COIN trial reported a significant reduction in chemotherapy dose intensity in the
cetuximab arm. A subgroup analysis indicated that the
mFOLFOX6 plus cetuximab group received lower doses
of infusional 5FU compared with the control arm (P ¼
.016), and the XELOX plus cetuximab group received
significantly reduced doses of both oxaliplatin (P ¼ .0018)
and capecitabine (P ¼ .004). This observed reduction of
chemotherapy dose intensity in the cetuximab arm may
explain in part the lack of efficacy observed in that negative
trial. Furthermore, the administered number of cycles of
oxaliplatin and cetuximab was significantly less in the
XELOX group compared with the mFOLFOX6 group
(P ¼ .016), indicating that the combined analysis of
XELOX and mFOLFOX6 is more likely confounded by
this discrepancy and raising the necessity of a reanalysis of
the 2 separate groups.
Controversies in KRAS Mutations and
Anti-EGFR Therapies

Recent retrospective, pooled subgroup analyses from prior
major trials provided more complexity on anti-EGFR
antibody therapy and KRAS mutational status. The KRAS
G13D mutation is observed in approximately 15% to
20% of KRAS mutant CRCs, differing with other cancers,
which most commonly contain KRAS codon 12 mutations.38 From a retrospective pooled analysis of multiple
trials in the salvage setting, including patients who were
treated in an off-trial setting, De Roock et al reported that
patients who received cetuximab combined with BSC
and/or chemotherapy with the KRAS G13D mutation
had significantly better outcomes than those with other
Cancer

Phase 3 Trials: KRAS and Skin Toxicity/Woo et al

KRAS mutations.8 Tejpar et al, in analyzing the CRYSTRAL and OPUS trial results, demonstrated significant
variations in tumor response (P ¼ .005) and PFS (P ¼
.046) in patients who had G13D mutant tumors compared with patients who had all other mutations.7 Those
authors also demonstrated improved clinical outcomes
with the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy (PFS,
7.4 months vs 6.0 months; HR, 0.47; P ¼ .039; tumor
response, 40.5% vs 22%; OR, 3.38; P ¼ .042) compared
with chemotherapy alone. However, the efficacy of cetuximab in patients who had tumors with KRAS G13D mutations still was inferior to the efficacy in patients who had
KRAS wild-type tumors (OS: HR, 1.61; P ¼ .0085; objective response: OR, 0.50; P ¼ .040). It is noteworthy that,
within the chemotherapy only arms, the PFS and OS for
patients who had tumors with the KRAS G13D mutation
was significantly worse than the PFS and OS for patients
who had tumors with other KRAS mutations or KRAS
wild-type. The median PFS was 6.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4-7.8 months) for patients who had
the KRAS G13D mutation, 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.2-9.5
months) for those who had the KRAS G12V mutation,
and 8.1 months (95% CI, 7.2-9.4 months) for those who
had other KRAS mutations. The median OS was 14.7
months (95% CI, 12.4-19.4 months) for patients who
had the KRAS G13D mutation, 17.8 months (95% CI,
15.5-21.7 months) for those who had the KRAS G12V
mutation, and 17.7 months (95% CI, 15.3-20.5 months)
for those who had other KRAS mutations. The worse survival and response rate for patients who had KRAS G13D
mutant tumors compared with those who had KRAS
G12V mutant tumors in the chemotherapy arm was statistically significant (PFS: HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.06-3.47; P
¼ .031; response rate: OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.99; P ¼
.47). However, the cause of the worse outcome for
patients with KRAS G13D mutant tumors remains
unclear and will require more careful analyses and trials.
Despite the potential association between KRAS
G13D tumors and better outcomes from treatments with
cetuximab, previous preclinical data do not correspond
with clinical observations. KRAS mutations occur in
approximately 30% to 40% of CRCs, and the KRAS
G13D mutation occurs in <20% of KRAS mutant CRCs.
Mutation analysis of various cancer cell lines at the Sanger
Institute39 identified the KRAS G13D mutation in the
HCT-116, DLD1, T84, LoVo, NCI-H747, and HCT15 CRC cell lines. Several studies have consistently
reported that HCT-116, DLD1, and LoVo CRC cells
containing the KRAS G13D mutation respond poorly to
cetuximab in vitro and in vivo.30,31,40,41 After homologous
Cancer

June 1, 2013

recombination, isogenic SW-48 CRC cells with KRAS
G13D responded to cetuximab and demonstrated EGFdependent activation of the KRAS-extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) pathway by demonstrating marked
activation of ERK in the presence of EGF, which was not
observed in KRAS G12V cells.8 However, this observation
is inconsistent with previous biochemical data indicating
the failure of cetuximab to inactivate the ERK pathway in
CRC cells that carried the KRAS G13D mutatoin.40,41
Oncogenic KRAS mutations, including G13D, strongly
suppressed the EGF-stimulated activation of ERK
phosphorylation and desensitized CRC cells to EGFR inhibition.41 Misale et al10 recently reported that cetuximabresistant variant Lim1215 CRC cells acquired either KRAS
G12R or G13D mutations after cetuximab-responsive parental Lim1215 cells had been continuously exposed to
cetuximab. Those investigators also demonstrated that isogenic Lim1215 cells with the KRAS G13D mutation
indeed displayed resistance to cetuximab, despite using the
same method of homologous recombination.10
In addition, the finding of cetuximab-associated
clinical outcomes in patients with KRAS G13D was not
reproducible in the other pooled retrospective analysis
with panitumumab and chemotherapy performed by Peeters and colleagues.9 Those authors reanalyzed subgroups
of patients that had different KRAS mutations in the
PRIME trial (FOLFOX4 with and without panitumumab) in the first-line setting, FOLFIRI with and without
panitumumab in the second-line setting, and BSC with
and without panitumumab in the salvage setting. None of
the individual KRAS mutations were associated consistently with better clinical outcomes in either the control
arm or the panitumumab-chemotherapy arm. Response
rates in that trial were comparable between patients with
different KRAS mutations. Notably, in the panitumumab-chemotherapy arm of the PRIME trial, the KRAS
G13D mutation was associated significantly with worse
OS, which was opposite to the observation in a subgroup
analysis from the CRYSTAL and OPUS trials. Details of
these analyses remain to be published. In parallel with current laboratory and clinical data, more careful observation
and re-evaluation of in vitro experiments and the development of new preclinical animal models, including the
transgenic/knock-in mouse (KRAS G13D), may provide a
new understanding of oncogenic KRAS in the development and treatment of CRC. In addition, as suggested by
others,7,8 independent, prospective, randomized clinical
trials are essential before therapeutic decisions to use
EGFR-directed antibodies in patients with the KRAS
G13D mutation can be included in clinical practice.
1947

Review Article

Misale et al10 and Diaz et al42 recently reported more
interesting findings of the emergence of KRAS mutations as
tumors evolve during the course of anti-EGFR treatment.
With high-sensitive deep sequencing and BEAMing (beads,
emulsion, amplification, and magnetics) technology,43 both
groups were independently able to detect KRAS codon 12
or 13 mutations in the rebiopsied tumors and/or sera from
patients whose tumors were initially KRAS wild-type then
subsequently developed resistance against cetuximab or panitumumab. Although it has not been clear whether the
mutations of conferring resistance are acquired during the
course of treatment10 or pre-exist as de novo mechanism of
resistance,42 the emergence of KRAS mutant clones potentially can be detected in a noninvasive manner months
before radiographic progression. This raises a question
regarding whether a serial test of KRAS mutation in serum
or tissue is appropriate for detecting early resistance and
switching to another antineoplastic regimen in patients on
an anti-EGFR MoAB. It also raises a question whether a
new diagnostic KRAS test should be performed at the time
of initiating the anti-EGFR treatment when the patient’s
disease progressed on a previous line of therapy and the
KRAS test was performed before that progression.
Skin Toxicities in Anti-EGFR Therapies

The anti-EGFR MoABs are associated with unique profiles of adverse effects. They include skin rash; electrolyte
abnormalities, especially the magnesium-wasting syndrome; and, particularly with cetuximab, infusion reaction caused by the immunogenicity of the chimeric
antibody. Among them, skin lesions,44,45 such as acneiform eruption, paronychial inflammation, hair abnormalities, and a marked increase in the length of the eyelashes,
are prominent, sometimes dose-limiting complications
that interfere significantly with patients’ quality of life.
Notably, none of the lesions were fatal,46 and the development and especially greater intensity of skin eruptions
may be associated with better outcomes of cetuximab47
and panitumumab.48 The CRYSTAL16 and PRIME20 trials and other trials9,12 in the salvage setting also reported
an association of skin toxicities with better outcomes.
Management of the dermatologic adverse effects of
anti-EGFR MoABs is a particular interest of medical
oncologists. The Skin Toxicity Evaluation Protocol with
Panitumumab (STEPP) study,49 a phase 2 open-label
randomized trial, evaluated the impact of a pre-emptive
prophylactic skin treatment regimen of skin moisturizers,
sunscreen, topical steroid, and doxycycline compared with
the impact of a conventional treatment strategy. The prophylactic skin treatment regimen decreased the incidence
1948

of National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
(NCI-CTC) grade 2 or greater skin toxicities and
improved quality of life assessed with the Dermatology Life
Quality Index. However, there was a limitation of objectively assessing adverse skin effects, and the number of
patients was small in the phase 2 trial despite the statistical
significance. The prophylactic treatment may have negated
the possible outcome-associated skin manifestations47 by
masking the adverse skin effects, although the authors demonstrated no significant difference in outcomes between the
pre-emptive arm and the standard therapy arm.49 Additional clinical trials and more experience will be required to
establish prophylactic management as the standard of care.
Conclusion

In summary, the current National Comprehensive Cancer
Network guidelines advise the use of panitumumab combined with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI but cetuximab combined only with FOLFIRI in the first-line treatment of
patients with mCRC. However, the manufacturer of panitumumab recently reiterated that the labeled indication
of panitumumab is as monotherapy in the salvage setting
because of severe toxicity when it is combined with chemotherapy.50 It was reported that, in a combination of panitumumab and FOLFIRI, the incidence of NCI-CTC
grade 3 diarrhea was 25%, which may lead to acute renal
failure and other complications.50 In addition, the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines
strongly advise against the concurrent use of bevacizumab
with either cetuximab or panitumumab in the setting of
first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic disease
based on results of the PACCE trial51 and the CAIRO2
trial,52 suggesting potentially adverse outcomes when
combining MoABs that are directed against EGFR with
bevacizumab. The advisory panel has recently removed
the recommendation for the use of cetuximab with FOLFOX as initial therapy for patients with advanced or metastatic disease because of the lack of benefit and the
increased incidence of grade 3 adverse events demonstrated in the MRC COIN and Nordic trials. However, a
recent meta-analysis,53 which included the CRYSTAL,
OPUS, COIN, and NORDIC VII trials, and the German
AIO study (capecitabine), and the CECOG study (infusional 5FU), demonstrated that only patients who
received infusional 5FU-based chemotherapy derived a
benefit from cetuximab, and the receipt of either oxaliplatin or irinotecan did not affect the benefit from cetuximab. The other meta-analysis of 14 randomized
controlled trials comparing the efficacy of cetuximab confirmed that the differences between trial results
Cancer

Phase 3 Trials: KRAS and Skin Toxicity/Woo et al

(heterogeneity P ¼ .02; I2 ¼ 62%) were explained best by
the fluoropyrimidine used, and PFS benefits were confined to the trials that combined an anti-EGFR MoAB
with infusional 5FU-based chemotherapy (HR, 0.77;
95% CI, 0.70-0.85; P < .00001).54 Therefore, the aforementioned preclinical data and meta-analysis indicate
that the benefit from cetuximab is associated significantly
with the use of infusional 5FU, targeting thymidylate synthase, which can be synergistically down-regulated by
cetuximab or panitumumab. In contrast, oxaliplatin and
irinotecan may not be attributable to the lack of benefit
from cetuximab, as indicated in the meta-analyses,
although a direct head-to-head comparison between
cetuximab with FOLFOX and FOLFIRI remains to be
reported. Bevacizumab combined with first-line chemotherapy has improved outcomes in the first-line systemic
therapy of mCRC regardless of KRAS mutation status.55
Ultimately, the recently completed but not yet
reported CALGB 80405 trial will define the role of antiEGFR antibody therapy with cetuximab and chemotherapy compared with bevacizumab and chemotherapy in
the initial treatment of KRAS wild-type CRC. Patients
were stratified according to physician-selected chemotherapy: FOLFOX versus FOLFIRI. That study will clarify
the clinical efficacy and position of cetuximab as a therapeutic option compared with bevacizumab in the firstline setting, most notably when it is combined with FOLFOX, because of its common use with FOLFOX. Taken
together, the results indicate that cetuximab is a reasonable option with chemotherapy as second-line and salvage
therapy for patients with advanced mCRC who have
KRAS wild-type tumors, whereas panitumumab remains
primarily a monotherapy option in the salvage setting
because of toxicity concerns. Decisions need to be made
regarding delays in the use of EGFR-directed therapy for
later lines of treatment. Those patients who have symptomatic disease that necessitates some degree of response, as
well as those who are not deterred by the dermatologic
toxicities of the EGFR-directed antibodies, may be candidates for their use in earlier lines of therapy.
Conflicting evidence exists regarding first-line antiEGFR therapy with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy as
well as KRAS G13D mutation-associated clinical outcomes in patients with mCRC. Precise interpretation and
re-evaluation of current trials is required. In particular, we
must pay greater regard to the preclinical data on mechanisms of interaction between chemotherapy and the antiEGFR antibodies, mechanisms of resistance to antiEGFR antibodies, the role of cross-over events in OS
data, and the significant dose reductions of chemotheraCancer
