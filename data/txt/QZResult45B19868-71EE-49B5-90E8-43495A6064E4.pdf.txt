Abstract
Author Manuscript

Genome-wide association studies have highlighted three major lung cancer susceptibility regions
at 15q25.1, 5p15.33 and 6p21.33. To gain insight into the possible mechanistic relevance of the
genes in these regions, we investigated the regulation of candidate susceptibility gene expression
by epigenetic alterations in healthy and lung tumor tissues. For genes up- or downregulated in
lung tumors the influence of genetic variants on DNA methylation was investigated and in vitro
studies were performed.

Author Manuscript

We analyzed 394 CpG units within 19 CpG islands in the susceptibility regions in a screening set
of 34 patients. Significant findings were validated in an independent patient set (n=50) with
available DNA and RNA. The most consistent overall DNA methylation difference between tumor
and adjacent normal tissue on 15q25 was tumor hypomethylation in the promoter region of
CHRNB4 with a median difference of 8% (p<0.001) which resulted in overexpression of the
transcript in tumors (p<0.001). Confirming previous studies we also found hypermethylation in
CHRNA3 and TERT with significant expression changes. Decitabine treatment of H1299 cells
resulted in reduced methylation levels in gene promoters, elevated transcript levels of CHRNB4
and CHRNA3 and a slight downregulation of TERT demonstrating epigenetic regulation of lung
cancer cells. SNPs rs421629 on 5p15.33 and rs1948, rs660652, rs8040868 and rs2036527 on

15q25.1, previously identified as lung cancer risk or nicotine addiction modifiers were associated
with tumor DNA methylation levels in the promoters of TERT and CHRNB4 (p<0.001)
respectively in two independent sample sets (n=82; n=150). In addition, CHRNB4 knock down in
two different cell lines (A549 and H1299) resulted in reduced proliferation
(pA549<0.05;pH1299L<0.001) and propensity to form colonies in H1299 cells.
These results suggest epigenetic deregulation of nicotinic acetylcholinereceptor subunit (nAChR)
genes which in the case of CHRNB4 is strongly associated with genetic lung cancer susceptibility
variants and a functional impact on tumorigenic potential.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Due to technical advances, genome-wide association (GWA) studies have now been
conducted for most common human malignancies including lung cancer. These studies have
identified genetic variants associated with chromosomal regions conferring elevated risks to
cancer development. This is well exemplified by three independent studies on lung cancer
that identified strong associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on
chromosome 15q25.1 and lung cancer risk (1–3). Six genes namely iron-responsive element
binding protein 2 (IREB2), aminoglycosid phosphotransferase domain (AGPHD),
proteasome alpha subunit isoform 1 (PSMA4) and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
subunit gene cluster consisting of CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4 are situated at this
locus. Two further studies have identified additional chromosomal regions on 5p15.33 and
6p21.33 as highly associated with individual risk of developing lung cancer (4, 5). These
two regions harbor three genes: telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) coding for the
catalytic subunit of the human telomerase, cleft-lip palate transmembrane protein 1-like
(CLPTM1L) and HLA-B associated transcript 3 (BAT3). These studies suggest that genetic
variants may predispose towards, or support the development of lung cancer. Currently,
underlying genes and functional mechanisms causing the elevated risk for many of the
identified cancer risk loci in GWAs are unknown, indicating the need to investigate the
regulation of candidate genes in these genomic regions (6).

With about 1.35 million new cases per year, lung cancer is the most common cancer and the
leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide (7). The initiation and progression of lung
cancer is caused by various events altering genomic structure through changes in the DNA
sequence and/or alteration of gene copy number, affecting gene expression and/or function.
Altered epigenetic regulation, e.g. changes in chromatin structure, DNA methylation and
abundance of small RNAs, is also involved in tumorigenesis (8–10). Early estimates of
global frequencies for CpG island methylation have suggested that up to 5.3% of all CpG
islands in a lung tumor genome are targeted by aberrant DNA hypermethylation (11).
Methylation events frequently lead to gene silencing of potential tumor suppressor genes
(12). Aberrant DNA methylation has been described as an early event in lung tumorigenesis
(13, 14) suggesting a role in tumor initiation and early steps of tumor progression. Brena et

al. have shown that DNA methylation patterns may serve as prognostic factors (15) and
genetic and epigenetic events may act in a concerted manner in human tumorigenesis (16).
One way in which genetic variation could affect lung cancer risk would be the modification
of epigenetic alterations in regulatory regions (17–21). A recent study investigated
epigenetic targets in the CHRN gene cluster on 15q25.1 and found epigenetic silencing of
CHRNA3 which impacts the ability to enter into apoptosis (22).

Author Manuscript

In this study, we investigate the hypothesis that epigenetic patterns in three genetic
susceptibility regions are altered in non-small cell lung (NSCLC) cancer, and thus,
deregulate the expression of lung cancer risk genes. We determined methylation patterns of
all CpG islands across the three lung cancer susceptibility regions. We additionally
hypothesized that there might be a connection between the genetic variation and epigenetic
patterns and analyzed tagSNPs to investigate the association of genetic variation with DNA
methylation.

DNA methylation screen in lung cancer susceptibility regions identifies aberrantly
methylated genes

In order to evaluate a possible epigenetic gene silencing of candidate lung cancer
susceptibility genes in malignant tissue, we systematically investigated quantitative DNA
methylation levels in 29 amplicons within 19 CpG islands (CGIs) situated in the three lung
cancer susceptibility regions. DNA methylation was analyzed in both lung tumor and
adjacent normal lung tissue from a screening set (set-1) consisting of 34 patients with
adenocarcinoma (AdC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) including all stages (see Table
1 for main characteristics of the investigated study populations). The relative location of
CGIs in the susceptibility regions is shown in the upper part of Figure 1. Actual methylation
values are represented in the middle part and estimated median methylation differences with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) are shown in the lower part of the figure. We consistently
observed DNA hypomethylation in tumors in the promoter of CHRNB4 where the median
difference was −8% (95%CI −12% to −3%, p≤0.001) (Figure 1A). Upstream of the
transcriptional start site of CHRNB4 we found a moderate but non-significant
hypermethylation in tumors, consistent with a previous report (22). Additionally, we
confirmed hypermethylation of previously published candidates like CHRNA3 on 15q25.1
(median hypermethylation 8%, 95%CI 4% to 12%, p≤0.001) and TERT on chromosome
5p15.33, where we observed the strongest hypermethylation in the 5′-UTR sequence of the
TERT gene (Median difference 16%, 95%CI 11% to 21%, p<0.001) (22). This was observed
in both histologies (SCC median difference 14.5%; p<0.001, AdC median difference
(AdC)=8%, p<0.001). CGIs in the gene body of TERT showed consistent hypomethylation
(Figure 1B). The eight amplicons analyzed in the promoter regions of CLPTM1L and BAT3
(chromosomal region 6p21.33) did not show statistically significant differences in
methylation (data not shown).
For amplicons which showed methylation differences in set 1, analyses were repeated in a
validation set (set-2) of 48 tumor-normal matched pairs (Table 1). Statistical analyses
confirmed significant methylation differences for CHRNB4, CHRNA3 and TERT

(Supplemental Figure 1). Overall, three CpG units in CHRNA3, nine CpGs units in TERT
and twelve CpGs units in CHRNB4 were included in the analysis. After stratification for
histology in set-2, amplicon-wise hypermethylation was validated for CHRNA3 in
adenocarcinoma patients (median difference 10.5%, 95%CI 5% to 15%, p<0.001),
hypomethylation for CHRNB4 in SCC (median difference=−5.5%, 95%CI −7% to −3%,
p<0.001) and hypermethylation for TERT in both histologies (median difference (SCC)
14%, 95%CI 9–20% p<0.001; median difference (AdC) 8%, 95%CI 4–13%, p<0.001).
Expression of target genes is in line with DNA methylation events

We next investigated whether altered DNA methylation levels in tumor tissue correlate with
reduced gene expression. The expression pattern was investigated for genes with confirmed
differential methylation in tumor versus adjacent normal tissue, namely CHRNB4, CHRNA3
and TERT. To assess differential gene expression, we analyzed the 48 tumor/normal pairs
from set-2 using quantitative RT-PCR. For CHRNB4 we detected increased transcription in
lung tumors of both histological subgroups (p=2.3*10−13). A larger than four-fold upregulation of CHRNB4 transcription levels was observed in 21 of 23 stage SCC patient
tumors. Statistical analysis revealed a significant overall down-regulation of CHRNA3
(p=0.02). After stratification for histology the strongest effect was detected in SCCs (median
four-fold reduction, p=0.002). CHRNA3 down-regulation (at least four-fold) was seen in
four out of ten stage I, all stage II tumors and in one of five stage III tumors. In AdCs no
uniform down-regulation was observed and the data showed high variation, but CHRNA3
expression in stage I tumors appeared down-regulated (Figure 2). Median TERT mRNA
expression was 10-fold up-regulated in tumors (p=3.8*10−7) which cannot readily be
explained by the observed DNA methylation data, but is in agreement with a previous study
(23). In order to explore the possible relationship between methylation and expression, we
dichotomized methylation differences (under or over 20%) and expression fold changes
(under or over 4-fold) in tumor compared to adjacent normal tissue. The best concordance
between promoter methylation and transcript level was observed for CHRNB4, where 83%
of hypomethylated samples showed up-regulation. A weaker concordance was observed for
CHRNA3 where 53% of samples showed hypermethylation and down-regulation.
In 65% of the samples TERT showed the previously reported, counterintuitive concordance
of hypermethylation with increased mRNA expression. Taken together, differential DNA
methylation patterns observed for the genes coding for subunits of the nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor seemed to agree with overall expression.

5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment of lung cancer cell line H1299 results in reexpression of
target genes
In order to test whether the removal of the epigenetic marks restores gene expression levels
we measured gene expression in the lung cancer cell line H1299, without treatment, and
following treatment with 0.5 μM of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) Figure 3. We chose
long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE1) repeat DNA methylation as a surrogate for the
effective loss of methylation following 5-Aza-dC treatment. H1299 cells showed reduced
levels of LINE1 methylation indicating successful treatment with 5-Aza-dC. Three genes
(CHRNA3, CHRNB4 and TERT) showed promoter methylation in H1299 ranging from

24−57%. Following treatment, a reduced level of DNA methylation at CHRNA3 (21%
versus 19%, p=0.002) and CHRNB4 (55% versus 42%, p<0.0002) was found, that
associated with increased expression (Figure 3B, p<0.01). A reduced TERT methylation
(p=0.0006) was observed but the correlation with expression did not reach statistical
significance, a finding in agreement with results in tissue samples.
Genotyping of tagSNPs identifies variant which influence methylation in tumors

To gain insight into the interplay between the epigenetic and genetic factors we genotyped
42 SNPs covering the three susceptibility regions identified in the GWA studies (see
Supplemental Table 3). This set included 26 SNPs from rs11639224 to rs11857532 covering
the 15q25.1 susceptibility region, 8 SNPs from rs4073918 to rs421629 on 5p15.33 and 8
SNPs from rs1046080 to rs7029 covering the 6p21.33 susceptibility region. We also
genotyped the reported variants for lung cancer risk and nicotine dependence rs1051730,
rs8034191 and rs12914385 on 15q25.1, as well as rs2736100 on 5p15.33 (1, 5). Genotyping
was performed on blood DNA from the set-1 cases, normal lung DNA from the set-2 cases
and later on tumor DNA from set-3 patients (Table 1). In order to determine the validity of
the genotypes obtained from tumor tissue in set-3, the available 18 paired samples of
adjacent normal tissue were also genotyped and 100% correlation with tumor-genotypes was
observed. We evaluated whether there is an association between genotype and methylation
in normal lung tissue, lung tumor tissue, or the difference between methylation in tumor
versus normal lung tissue (set-1 and set-2). The within-amplicon correlation of methylation
values among CpG units is represented in Figures 4A and 5A. This correlation was taken
into account by bootstrapping to generate amplicon-wise estimates of methylation
differences. In order to detect genotype-methylation associations DNA methylation data
were investigated assuming a dominant, a recessive and a three-genotype model for the
effect of the variant allele. After applying a Kruskal-Wallis test to detect associations
between genotypes and methylation in set-1 and -2 the SNPs rs1948 (p=0.0001) (Figure 4B),
rs 660652 (p=0.005) (Figure 4C), rs 8040868 (p=0.01) (Figure 4D), and rs 2036527 (p=
1×10−8) (Figure 4E) on 15q25.1 and one SNP rs421629 on chromosome 5p15.33 were
significantly associated with ampliconwise tumor DNA methylation in the CHRNB4 and
TERT (Figure 5B) promoters, respectively. For CHRNA3 we observed a significant
association at the amplicon-wise level with very minor differences among genotypes at CpG
unit resolution (see Supplemental-Figure 4). The rs421629-TERT ampliconwise DNA
methylation association was also true (p<0.01) for normal lung tissue (Figure 5C) even
though this significance could not be detected on single CpG unit level (see Figure 5D). We
were able to validate significant tumor-specific associations in set-3 tumors (n=150) for all
SNPs detected in the screen (prs1948=5×10−5, prs660652=0.0001, prs8040868=0.0007,
prs2036527=0.03, prs421629=0.003 see Figure 4). To evaluate the linkage between the SNPs
associated with DNA methylation in our study and the reported GWA risk SNPs we used the
haplotype analysis software THESIAS 3.1 {, 2008 #7}. In our sample set we would predict
the SNPs rs8034191, rs2036527, rs1051730 and rs8040868 to be situated in one haplotype
block underlining the importance of our findings (see Supplemental-table 5).
In order to investigate whether the methylation in the promoter region of CHRNB4 is allele
specific, we took advantage of public data repositories to explore the pattern of linkage

disequilibrium (LD) in the investigated region. Supplemental Figure 5 summarizes these
results. Based on the CEU panel of The 1000 Genomes Project (Utah residents with
Northern and Western European ancestry from the CEPH collection), we found several
recombination hotspots in the region. The polymorphisms genotyped in the present study
and variants which have been previously reported to be associated with lung cancer risk
generally shared a LD block. Interestingly, the variant rs67426328 in the promoter region of
the investigated genes showed a moderate LD with several variants we found to be
associated with methylation, for example rs1948 (r2=0.65) and rs8040868 (r2=0.65)
(Supplemental Figure 6).

Further we sequenced the CHRNB4 promoter of 20 lung cancer cases preselected for
heterozygosity at rs8040868 and rs1948. At rs67426328 five were homozygous for CC, four
for GG and eleven were CG carriers reflecting an overall linkage of R2=0.36 to the SNPs
rs1948 and rs8040868. Tumors and adjacent normals of four of the heterozygous individuals
were selected for bisulfite sequencing.
Forty-five independent clones from tumors and fifty-four from adjacent normal tissue were
sequenced. and revealed significant overall hypomethylation in tumors (39.8% methylation)
compared to normal lung tissue (48.3% methylation) (p=0.0002) (Supplemental Figure 7).
In addition we investigated the question if there is allele-specific methylation present in
tumors and adjacent normal tissues. In the normal tissue we could detect differential
methylation in the promoter region between C (25 clones, 44%) and G alleles (29 clones,
51.9%) (p=0.015). In the tumor tissue we found methylation differences between the C (22
clones; 50.5%) and the G allele (23 clones; 27.9%) DNA methylation (p<0.0001).

Taken together, we found genotype methylation correlations mainly in tumor tissue in a
screening set and were able to validate the results in an independent set of 150 further
tumors. In addition we could detect allelic segregation of DNA methylation analyzing four
individuals heterozygous for the CHRNB4 promoter SNP rs67426328. These data limited by
the fragment size that can successfully be bisulfite sequenced cannot be directly linked to
our tagging-SNP related data as the promoter variant only shows 36% linkage to our
associated SNPs rs1948 and rs8040868.

CHRNB4 knockdown leads to reduced proliferation and propensity to form colonies
In order to test tumor-specific features of CHRNB4 expression we knocked down the
transcript in two lung cancer cell lines H1299 and A549. After treatment of lung cancer cells
with a pool of four different siRNAs, each targeting CHRNB4, for 96h we detected a
reduced HOECHST signal which represents DNA amount for H1299 (p=0.0002) and A549
(p=0.0059) cells (Figure 6A). The second measurement of Calcein signals, which indicates

the amount of metabolic active cells, showed significance for both cell lines (H1299,
p<0.0001; A549, p=0.0213) as well (Figure 6B). A reduced transcript level of CHRNB4 in
H1299 and A549 was detected using RT-PCR (H1299, p<0.05; A549, p<0.001) Figure 6C.
A time course experiment measuring the growth of cells every 24h reveals a different
doubling time between treated and untreated cells (Figure 6D). Single evaluation in a
deconvolution experiment testing the four single siRNAs separately confirmed our
observations on HOECHST (Figure 6E) and Calcein levels (Figure 6F). Furthermore colony
formation assays revealed a reduced ability to form colonies in CHRNB4 knockdown cells
seeded in two different concentrations (Figure 6G). Taken together our observations
strongly indicate an influence of CHRNB4 transcripts on proliferation and further on the
propensity to form colonies.

Discussion
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Several genome-wide association studies and a subsequent meta-analysis have identified
three consistent haplotypes conferring elevated risk for lung cancer on chromosomes
15q25.1, 6p21.33 and 5p15.33. Possible explanations for increased risk could be expression
differences of genes in these regions due to genetic variation in regulatory sequences or
epigenetic modifications, different activities of proteins encoded by different alleles, or
increased likelihood of genes to become deregulated during tumorigenesis. In the present
study we quantified DNA methylation levels ampliconwise in lung tumor tissues in CGIs of
the three candidate regions and compared these profiles to those in normal lung tissue. Our
search for aberrant DNA methylation changes identified hypomethylation for CHRNB4 and
hypermethylation for CHRNA3 and TERT, as well as expression changes on the RNA level.
In vitro treatment with the demethylating drug 5-Aza-dC and subsequent elevated
expression of gene products confirmed the regulating effects of epigenetic marks in gene
promoters. We were able to link genetic and epigenetic factors in the TERT and CHRNB4
promoter and found functional relevance for CHRNB4 transcript levels in cell lines
underscoring the tissue-specific results.

Author Manuscript

The present data suggests CHRNB4 as a new susceptibility gene on 15q25.1, responsible for
the increased risk of certain individuals of developing lung cancer. Sequence-dependent,
allele-specific methylation is a newly recognized phenomenon which was also found to be
relevant for tumorigenesis (21, 24–26). In an effort to link genetic and epigenetic
modifications in the lung cancer susceptibility regions, we looked for SNPs that significantly
affect DNA methylation levels at certain CpG sites. We found the strongest evidence for
genotype-specific methylation in the promoter of CHRNB4 caused by SNPs that were
recently described as significantly associated either with lung cancer risk in Afro Americans
(27) or with onset of tobacco smoking (28–30). We found the strongest genotype-specific
methylation for CHRNB4 in the tumor and not in the adjacent normal tissue which indicates
a tumor-specific effect. Given the large proportion of ever-smokers in our study population
our analyses could not determine smoking relatedness of this effect. However, we could
show linkage of alleles of a promoter SNP to methylation. Given that the risk SNPs are
related to cigarette consumption, it is possible that the genotype-specific methylation events
in dedifferentiated cells, could be related to smoking as an environmental factor which
interacts with the CHRNB4 promoter. This would also explain the deregulation of CHRNB4

in nearly every tumor sample, which is evidently relevant for growth of lung cancer cell
lines. In order to investigate if the transcription factor ASCL1 recently reported to regulate
CHRNA3 and CHRNB4 expression {Improgo, #3367} binds to sites involving any of the
differentially methylated CpGs we searched for E-Boxes throughout the promoter region but
could not find any CpG involved in ASCL1 binding sites (see Supplemetal Figure 4). To
sum up the major findings in the genomic region 15q25.1 our data together with data from
Paliwal et al. (22) suggest an underlying deregulation of nicotinic acetylcholinereceptor
subunit genes (nAChR) genes in cancer and a direct effect on tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

For TERT, our data confirm and support previous findings regarding the promoter
hypermethylation and tumor-specific expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase.
Additionally, we found strong gene body hypomethylation which could contribute to more
open DNA conformation and higher transcription activity (31). Recent data also suggest a
connection between DNA methylation, transcription, histone modification and alternative
splicing, which could reflect an important role of gene body CpG islands in the TERT gene
(32–34).
Our data also show an association between genotype and quantitative methylation level in
the promoter of TERT promoter in lung tumors and also in adjacent normal tissue.

Author Manuscript

A possible mechanism for our observations regarding genotype-methylation patterns in
TERT might be that SNPs alter DNA binding sites for protein complexes that either recruit
epigenetic modifiers (35–37) or affect binding of transcription factors resulting in altered
gene expression from the individual alleles, which subsequently results in different
epigenetic modifications (38). It suggests a cancer supporting event which is dependent on
the genotype and impacts the epigenetic pattern either on DNA methylation or on chromatin
level. It may also describe a novel mechanism of carcinogenesis with treatment promise due
to the relevance of TERT expression (39).
Future experiments will aim at mutagenesis of the identified SNPs in cell lines and animal
models and measurement of the epigenetic consequences in order to determine the causality
of variants situated in the lung cancer risk regions.

Author Manuscript

Our results may also guide the ranking of candidate lung cancer risk genes. For chromosome
15q25.1, they include the nAChR subunit genes, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4. These genes
belong to a gene family comprised of five subunits assembling to either homo- (α7, 8 or 9
subunit receptors) or heteropentamers (combinations of α2–6 or α10 with β2–4 subunits)
enclosing a central ion channel. Dependent on the type of the expressed receptors, different
signal cascades, e.g. apoptosis or the Ras-MAPK pathway, are induced in the cell by
calcium influx (40). It has been shown that nicotine, by binding, activates homomeric α7
receptors, regulating the release of epidermal growth factor (EGF) as well as the stress
hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline, and thus contributes to several cancers including
lung cancer (41). Because of a higher affinity to nicotine, the heteromeric receptors are
rapidly desensitized by smoking exposure (42), which leads to the interruption of γaminobutyric acid (GABA) excretion, which beside the inhibitory neurotransmitter function,
has been shown to have tumor suppressing effects in numerous cancers (43). Even though

Scherf et al.

previous studies have indicated that nAChR genes are also involved in smoking addiction
thus affecting lung cancer risk, our study together with results from Paliwal and colleagues
(22) reveal the direct importance of CHRNA3 and CHRNB4 expression in lung
tumorigenesis. If the underlying mechanism causing epigenetic deregulation and subsequent
loss of function is based on heritable host factors, it could even mimic strong environmental
exposure to tobacco smoke, which would also explain the strong correlation of lung cancer
susceptibility to 15q25 SNPs regardless of the smoking status (44). Another recent study
was able to detect two risk haplotypes for familial lung cancer after 15q25.1 fine-mapping.
One contains PSMA4 which was found to be overexpressed in lung cancer and to have a
proliferative effect in lung cancer cell lines. The other risk haplotype includes CHRNA3/5
and CHRNB4 (45). Our results implicate epigenetic deregulation of CHRNA3 and CHRNB4
in lung cancer susceptibility.

Author Manuscript

With CHRNB4 we found a new strong candidate for lung carcinogenesis, which is
deregulated in nearly every sample. To our knowledge this is the first study pointing to a
connection between genetics and epigenetics in lung cancer susceptibility as a potential
mechanism involved in lung tumorigenesis. Further experiments are required to bring
methylation as well as other epigenetic layers, expression and tumor development into a
chronological context and to sort the effects of differential gene expression to cell
metabolism and detoxification or smoking behaviour. Our study also serves as “proof of
concept”, suggesting that regions associated with genetic susceptibility to cancer are good
targets to identify epigenetic aberrations which can be linked to genetic background and
which deregulate genes influencing cell growth making this approach relevant to cancer
research. Further interdisciplinary approaches to investigate the events in lung tumorigenesis
are necessary to elucidate the function of different levels of biological information.

For the initial methylation screen, DNAs isolated from sample pairs each consisting of
frozen, histologically confirmed tumor and adjacent normal lung tissue, from 34 lung cancer
patients recruited at the Thoraxklinik Heidelberg were used (set-1). Freshly-frozen,
histologically confirmed tumor samples from another 48 non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients, as well as the corresponding adjacent morphologically normal lung tissue
were retrieved from the tissue bank of the Thoraxklinik in Heidelberg (set-2). These were
used as a validation set for methylation and expression analyses of target genes identified in
the initial screen. For the genotype analysis gDNA was isolated from blood samples of set-1
patients and normal lung tissue DNA from set-2. For replication of genotypemethylation
associations we analyzed another independent set of tumors (n=150, set-3). Matched normal
tissues of >10% of the set-3 patients (n=18) were also genotyped to exclude systematic
tumor-specific genotype alterations. All study participants provided written informed
consent, the collection and use of the materials was approved by the Ethics committee of the
University of Heidelberg (270/2001; 199/2001). (See Table 1 for a detailed description of
the study groups.)

DNA isolation

Author Manuscript

DNA from tissue was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden)
according to the manufacturer's protocol or by proteinase K digestion with subsequent
precipitation. Genomic DNA from whole blood or buffy coat from 5 ml venous blood in
EDTA was isolated using either the QIAamp DNA blood midi kit (Qiagen), or by an
automated DNA extraction protocol on the MagNA Pure System (Roche) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.
RNA isolation, reverse transcription and expression analysis

Author Manuscript

Tumors and adjacent normal lung tissues from sample set-2 were used to extract RNA.
RNAs were isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. To generate cDNAs two aliquots of 0.5μg total RNA were reverse transcribed
using the First Strand Synthesis Supermix (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). First strand
synthesis of the RNA was conducted with OligodT as well as random hexamer primers.
Both reactions were combined afterwards. Reverse transcription PCR was performed with a
LightCycler (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) with primers and conditions as listed in
Supplementary Table 1. Gene expression was normalized to the average expression of the
two housekeeping genes succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A (SDHA) and TATA
binding protein (TBP) (see Supplemental Figure 3).
Methylation analysis

Author Manuscript

Quantitative DNA methylation analysis was conducted using base-specific cleavage and
matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF
MS) with the Epityper application (Sequenom, San Diego). The method includes bisulfite
treatment of genomic DNA, PCR, in vitro transcription and base-specific cleavage of the
generated RNA followed by mass-spectrometry analysis (46). Generated RNA fragments
contain one or more CpGs which are termed one CpG unit. In order to correct for a potential
PCR bias, we generated a six point standard by mixing in vitro whole genome amplified
DNA (unmethylated) with SssI treated (methylated) DNA in defined ratios of 0, 20, 40, 60,
80, 100 %. The standard was included for each amplicon and best fitting curves were
computed using R statistical environment on http://www.r-project.org (R 2.9.0). DNA
methylation data possibly influenced by variations in DNA sequence (e.g. published or
newly identified SNPs) within the amplicon were eliminated. Primers and conditions as
listed in Supplemental Table 2.

Author Manuscript

For bisulfite sequencing of the CHRNB4 promoter we amplified the bisulfite treated DNA
with primers that included the SNP rs67426328 and substantial parts of the promoter of
CHRNB4 (see Supplemental Table 3 and Supplemental Figure 4). Analysis was conducted
using the DNA methylation analysis platform BISMA online http://biochem.jacobsuniversity.de/BDPC/BISMA/AnalyzeMethylationUniqueSequence.php.
Genotyping
Non-tumor DNAs of 82 patients (set-1 and set-2) with confirmed lung cancerwere
genotyped using the iPlex Typer application (Sequenom) as previously described (47).

Information for the SNPs selection (Supplemental Table 3) was extracted from the website
of the international HapMap project http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. We selected SNPs that
cover the three genomic regions of interest with a R2>0.8 and MAF of >0.05. Additionally,
we genotyped SNPs which have been found to be significantly associated with lung cancer
risk or nicotine addiction in genome-wide association studies (1, 2, 5) and SNPs used for
haplotype analyses on 15q25 (45). SNPs genotyped with call rates <90% or those that did
not meet Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in the controls were excluded from further analyses.
For the replication analysis lung tumor DNA from a further 150 patients (set-3) was
genotyped.
Knockdown and 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine treatment

Author Manuscript

The human lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299 were a gift of Dr. Ruprecht Kuner and
was cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10 mM Hepes (PAN, Hannover), supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown in tissue culture flasks at 37°C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere. Treatment for H1299 was performed with a concentration of 0.5μM 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) added to the media for 72h, with fresh media replacements every
24 h.
We conducted gene knockdown of CHRNB4 using siRNAs (Dharmacon) in 20nM
concentration for 96h in A549 and H1299 cells.
As a control we used scrambled siRNAs (siCON) for normalization of our readout. We used
Hoechst (4μg/ml end concentration) and Calcein (0.1μg/ml end concentration) costaining for
detection of DNA amount and metabolic activity representing cell number. The SpectraMax
plate reader was used to analyze luminescent signals.

Author Manuscript

For colony formation assays we transfected cells with 20 nM concentration of CHRNB4 and
siCON siRNAs respectively. After 24 hours we washed the cells with PBS, detached the
cells by Trypsin/EDTA treatment and passaged them into a fresh 6-well plate seeding two
different cell numbers, namely 200 and 400 cells. For determination of propensity to form
colonies we counted colonies as previously published (48).
Statistical analyses

Author Manuscript

The non-normal distribution of methylation and expression data and the relatively small
number of observations for some experiments motivated the use of non-parametric statistics.
Differences in methylation levels were investigated by using Wilcoxon signed ranks tests
and quantified by median values with 95% confidence intervals. Heatmaps were created
with the TIGR Multi-Experiment Viewer software (TIGR MeV 4.1). Transcript level up- or
down-regulation in tumor and matched adjacent normal tissue pairs was quantified by
median fold-changes and assessed using Wilcoxon signed rank tests (H0: μ=1). Robust
bisquare M-regression was used to explore changes in methylation and expression after 72 h
5-Aza-dC-treatment (0.5 and 1μM) of the cell line. The correlation among methylation
levels in neighboring CpG units, and the relationship between methylation and gene
expression were measured by Spearman's rank correlation rho. Amplicon-wise associations
were quantified by bootstrapping, taking into account the intra-sample correlation of

methylation values (10 000 bootstrap samples). Deviation from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium among control genotypes was investigated by chi-square tests. The association
between genotype and lung cancer was analysed using multivariable logistic regression,
where odds ratios were adjusted for age, gender and smoking status. Kruskal-Wallis tests
were used to evaluate genotype-methylation associations.

revealed diverging growth curves for cells treated with siRNAs against CHRNB4 compared
to those ones that were treated with siCON siRNAs E) and F) Deconvolution experiments
with four single siRNAs (20nM) in H1299 and A549 G) Knockdown for both cell lines in
the deconvolution experiment H) CHRNB4 knockdown cells show a reduced propensity to
form colonies. Results are displayed from a 6-well plate and also in a bar chart.
Signal intensity is given as raw values (relative units)
*: p<0.05
**: p<0.01
