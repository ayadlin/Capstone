BACKGROUND: Both everolimus and temozolomide are associated with single-agent activity in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET). A phase 1/2 study was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of temozolomide in combination with everolimus in patients who have advanced pancreatic NET. METHODS: Patients were treated with temozolomide at a dose of 150 mg/m2
per day on days 1 through 7 and days 15 through 21 in combination with everolimus daily in each 28-day cycle. In cohort 1, temozolomide was administered together with everolimus at 5 mg daily. Following demonstration of safety in this cohort, subsequent patients
in cohort 2 were treated with temozolomide plus everolimus at 10 mg daily. The duration of temozolomide treatment was limited to 6
months. Patients were followed for toxicity, radiologic and biochemical response, and survival. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients were
enrolled, including 7 in cohort 1 and 36 in cohort 2. Treatment was associated with known toxicities of each drug; no synergistic toxicities were observed. Among 40 evaluable patients, 16 (40%) experienced a partial response. The median progression-free survival
duration was 15.4 months. Median overall survival was not reached. CONCLUSIONS: Temozolomide and everolimus can be safely
administered together in patients with advanced pancreatic NET, and the combination is associated with encouraging antitumor activity. Future studies evaluating the efficacy of combination therapy compared to treatment with either agent alone are warranted.

INTRODUCTION
With the recent approval of the targeted agents everolimus and sunitinib, a broad range of systemic therapeutic options
can now be considered for the treatment of advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET).1,2 In this study, we
explored the antitumor activity of everolimus administered in combination with temozolomide, an oral alkylating agent
that has been associated with antitumor activity in advanced pancreatic NET.
Single-agent activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus has been observed in
phase 2 studies and subsequently confirmed in a randomized phase 3 study of patients with pancreatic NET.1,3,4 Although
everolimus has been associated with a clear improvement in progression-free survival duration compared with placebo (11
versus 5.5 months), the overall tumor response rate is low (4%).1 Similarly, a low objective response rate (9%) has been
observed in patients with pancreatic NET treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib.2
Because of the low response rates associated with these targeted agents, patients with a high tumor burden or symptoms from bulk of disease may benefit from treatment with a cytotoxic agent due to their higher response rates. Although
both streptozocin and dacarbazine have been associated with antitumor activity in pancreatic NET,5,6 the use of these
intravenously administered drugs for advanced pancreatic NET has not been universally adopted. In contrast, temozolomide, an oral analogue of dacarbazine, has been increasingly used for the treatment of pancreatic NET.7 Retrospective
studies evaluating single-agent temozolomide in this setting have reported overall response rates of 8% to 25%.8,9 In a
larger series of 53 patients with pancreatic NET treated with various temozolomide-based regimens, 18 (34%)

experienced partial or complete responses.10 The highest
activity reported to date of temozolomide-based therapy
is from a recent single-institution retrospective study in
which 30 patients with advanced pancreatic NET were
treated with temozolomide in combination with capecitabine.11 In this study, the reported response rate was 70%,
and the median progression-free survival duration was 18
months.
Prospective studies of temozolomide-based regimens appear to confirm the activity of temozolomide in
patients with advanced pancreatic NET. In 2 single-institution phase 2 studies, temozolomide has been administered using a dose-intense schedule of 150 mg/m2 per day
administered for 7 days every other week.12,13 In the first
study, which assessed the combination of temozolomide
and thalidomide, 5 of 11 patients with pancreatic NET
experienced partial responses.12 In a follow-up study evaluating the combination of temozolomide and bevacizumab, objective tumor responses were observed in 5 of 15
(33%) patients; the median progression-free survival duration for patients with pancreatic NET in this study was
14.3 months.13 In another recent study of patients with
NET from various sites of origin, temozolomide was
administered at a dose of 100 mg daily in combination
with bevacizumab at 7.5 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Responses
were observed in 9 of 15 (60%) patients.14
In light of the demonstrated activity of both everolimus and temozolomide in patients with advanced pancreatic NET, we sought to explore the safety and antitumor
activity of these 2 agents administered in combination.
We performed a prospective, phase 1/2 study at 3 institutions. Temozolomide was administered using a doseintense regimen of 150 mg/m2 every other week. Everolimus was administered in combination with temozolomide at a dose of 5 mg in an initial safety cohort, and
following evidence of tolerability, at a dose of 10 mg daily
in a second cohort. Treatment with temozolomide was
limited to 6 months to limit long-term toxicity, and prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was required.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population

Patients were required to have histologically confirmed
low- or intermediate-grade (grade 1 and 2) metastatic or
locally unresectable pancreatic NET. Patients with poorly
differentiated or high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma
were excluded. Patients were further required to have
measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria; Eastern Cooperative
Cancer

September 1, 2013

Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of  2;
adequate hepatic function (serum bilirubin  1.5 times
upper limit of the normal range [ULN]); aspartate aminotransferase  3 times ULN ( 5 times if liver metastases
were present); and adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count  1500/mm3; platelets  100,000/
mm3). Patients with fasting serum cholesterol > 300 mg/
dL or fasting triglycerides > 2.5 times ULN could begin
treatment after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering
medication. Patients were excluded if they had received
prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor or temozolomide or if they were receiving chronic treatment with systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive agents.
Patients were enrolled in the study between June
2008 and November 2010. All patients provided signed,
informed consent as required by the institutional review
boards of the participating centers, which included the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Massachusetts General
Hospital (both in Boston, Mass), and Lahey Clinic Medical Center (Burlington, Mass).
Treatment Program

Temozolomide was administered to all patients at a starting dose of 150 mg/m2 on days 1 to 7 and days 15 to 21
of a 28-day cycle. Everolimus was administered together
with temozolomide in 2 dose cohorts. Cohort 1 was
designed to consist of a minimum of 3 evaluable patients
treated with everolimus at a dose of 5 mg daily. If a doselimiting toxicity (DLT) was observed in these patients
during the first 28 days, 3 additional evaluable patients
were to be enrolled with dose escalation to cohort 2 only if
no additional DLTs were observed. In cohort 2, patients
received everolimus 10 mg daily together with temozolomide. DLT was defined as grade  3 nonhematologic toxicity, grade  2 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia failing
to revert to  grade 1 within 2 weeks, febrile neutropenia,
or inability of a patient to take > 75% of the planned dose
during the treatment period.
Because of the risk for temozolomide-related selective lymphopenia, the maximum treatment duration of
temozolomide was limited to 6 months. Patients also
received prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly P. carinii) with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 1
tablet given orally every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
Patients with allergies to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
received an alternate, standard pneumocystis prophylaxis
regimen. After completing 6 months of therapy with
temozolomide, everolimus alone was continued until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or unacceptable
toxicity.

Original Article

Dose adjustments for temozolomide and everolimus
were allowed for both hematologic and nonhematologic
toxicity. Treatment was held if patients developed an
absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm3 or a platelet
count < 50,000/mm3 and was not resumed until full hematologic recovery. On recovery, treatment was resumed
with a dose reduction of temozolomide by 50 mg/m2 and
dose reduction of everolimus to 5 mg daily if receiving 10
mg daily or to 5 mg every other day if receiving 5 mg
daily. Treatment with both drugs was also held for
grade  2 stomatitis or pneumonitis or other grade  3
nonhematologic toxicity. Treatment was resumed with
dose reduction pending resolution of nonhematologic
toxicities to grade  1.
Radiologic tumor assessment and biochemical assessment with plasma chromogranin A levels were performed
every 2 cycles (8 weeks) after initiation of treatment.
Statistical Methods

The primary objective of this study was to determine the
radiographic response rate for the combination of temozolomide and everolimus in patients with advanced pancreatic NETs. Secondary objectives included assessment
of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS),
biochemical response rate, and toxicity.
Responses were determined by RECIST criteria.
Patients were followed for progression and survival
through December 2011. PFS was defined as the time
between study enrollment and progression of disease or
death. In the analysis of PFS, patients who withdrew from
the study for reasons other than progression or death were
censored at the time of discontinuation of study therapy.
OS was defined as the time between study enrollment and
death due to any cause. Both PFS and OS were estimated
by the Kaplan-Meier method.
Biochemical response was defined as a decrease in
chromogranin A by 50% or more from baseline in
patients with an elevated chromogranin A at baseline.
Toxicity and complications of treatment were assessed
based on reports of adverse events, physical examinations,
and laboratory assessments.
This study used 2 cohorts. The first cohort received
temozolomide, 150 mg/m2 on days 1 to 7 and days 15 to
21 of a 28-day cycle, in combination with everolimus at a
dose of 5 mg daily, and the second cohort received temozolomide in combination with everolimus at 10 mg daily if
treatment was tolerated in cohort 1. Power calculations
were based on the anticipation that patients were receiving
full doses of both drugs in cohort 2. The proposed regimen
was to be considered worthy for further investigation if a

true response rate in this cohort was 15% or greater and not
worthy if it was 5% or less. A total of 32 evaluable patients
were planned in cohort 2. Seventeen patients were entered
in the first stage; one response was required to enroll an
additional 15 patients. With this design, the study had overall power of 83% and an overall type 1 error of 0.18.
RESULTS
A total of 43 patients enrolled in the study, including 7 in
cohort 1 and 36 in cohort 2 (Table 1). Patients had a
median age of 53 years; 60% were male, and approximately 40% received concurrent treatment with octreotide. The majority (77%) had not received prior systemic
therapy, with the exception of octreotide. Thirty patients
(70%) had evidence of radiographic progression of disease
prior to initiation of therapy.
Seven patients, of whom 6 were evaluable, were enrolled in cohort 1 and received temozolomide at a dose of
150 mg/m2 daily for 7 days every other week in combination with everolimus at 5 mg daily. Among the first 3
patients, 1 patient experienced a DLT consisting of grade
4 thrombocytopenia. Four additional patients, of whom 3
were evaluable, enrolled with no further observed DLT,
and cohort 2 was subsequently initiated. Thirty-six
patients enrolled in cohort 2 and were treated with temozolomide at 150 mg/m2 daily for 7 days every other week
in combination with everolimus at 10 mg daily.

Patients in the 2 cohorts received a median of 8.5
four-week treatment cycles (range, 1-28). Twenty-one
patients discontinued treatment due to disease progression, which was the most common reason for treatment
discontinuation (Table 2). An additional 9 patients discontinued therapy due to treatment-related toxicity,
including pneumonitis (n 5 3), edema (n 5 1), rash
(n 5 2), elevated creatinine (n 5 2), and elevated liver
function tests (n 5 1). Eight patients were removed at investigator discretion or for withdrawal of consent. At the
time of data analysis, 5 patients were still receiving study
therapy.
Although hematologic toxicities did not lead to any
cases of treatment discontinuation, they were nevertheless
commonly observed (Table 3). Nearly half (44%) of
patients experienced grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia, and 16%
experienced grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia. However,
complications from hematologic toxicities were uncommon. Infections were relatively rare. One patient without
prior knowledge of hepatitis B infection experienced reactivation of viral hepatitis (consisting of grade 4 elevation
in alanine aminotransferase) after completing 9 months of
therapy and while receiving everolimus alone. After discontinuation of everolimus and initiation of therapy for
hepatitis B, his liver function tests normalized. Pneumonitis developed in 3 (7%) patients. There were no cases of
bleeding or hemorrhage. Other common toxicities
included mild mucositis, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, or hypertriglyceridemia. Electrolyte disturbances,
including decreased magnesium, calcium, and phosphate
levels, were also observed but did not cause symptoms.
Among 40 patients who underwent restaging scans
and were evaluable for response, 16 (40%) experienced
partial responses, as defined by RECIST criteria. Nearly
all of the remaining patients (53%) experienced stable disease as their best response to therapy, and only 3 patients
(7%) had progressive disease. Biochemical responses,

common and were observed in 14 of 31 (45%) patients
with elevated baseline levels (Table 4).
The median PFS duration was 15.4 months (95%

OS was not reached (Fig. 1).
DISCUSSION
Previous studies have demonstrated that temozolomide
and everolimus independently have activity in patients
with neuroendocrine tumors. In this study, we demonstrate that these 2 agents can be administered together
safely at therapeutic dose levels. We further show that this
regimen is active and associated with both a high response
rate and with encouraging PFS duration.

been shown to be active in patients with advanced pancreatic NET. Estimated overall response rates in retrospective

studies range from 8% to 70%.8-11 Prospective studies
have suggested overall tumor response rates of 33% to
60%.12-14 These studies are limited, however, by the
inclusion of small numbers of patients with pancreatic
NET with response estimates based on 15 patients or
fewer. Our observed response rate of 40% in 40 patients
with pancreatic NET is consistent with previous observations and serves to confirm the activity of temozolomidebased regimens in this setting.
Two biologically targeted agents, sunitinib and
everolimus, were recently approved for use in patients
with advanced pancreatic NET based on the results of
large, placebo-controlled studies.1,2 Overall tumor
response rates in these studies as measured by RECIST,
however, were low. Sunitinib was associated with an
overall response rate of 9%, and everolimus with an overall response rate of 4%. The primary benefit observed
with these agents was their effect on PFS. Treatment
with sunitinib was associated with a median PFS of 11
months, as compared with 4.5 months for placebo; treatment with everolimus was associated with a median PFS
of 11.4 months, as compared with 5.5 months for
placebo.
The median PFS of 15.4 months observed in this
study with the combination of temozolomide and everolimus is encouraging and superior to the reported PFS
durations observed with everolimus or sunitinib in the
randomized studies. These results, however, need to be
interpreted with caution given the fact that this is a single-arm study. In addition, a requirement for disease
progression prior to study enrollment was included in
the randomized registration studies of everolimus and
sunitinib, but was not included in our study. Although
the majority of patients in our study (70%) had evidence
3216

(B) overall survival.

of disease progression prior to therapy, some patients,
particularly those with symptomatic or extensive disease, began therapy shortly after diagnosis. The inclusion of patients without prior evidence of progression
may overestimate PFS due to the often indolent nature
of disease.
There also were differences among patients in
use of concurrent octreotide that could potentially
influence interpretation of our study results. However,
given that objective tumor shrinkage with octreotide
is rare, it is unlikely that octreotide use has influenced
our observations regarding the response rate associated
with temozolomide and everolimus. Furthermore,
although octreotide has been associated with
improved PFS in midgut NETs, an antiproliferative
effect in pancreatic NET has not been established to
date.15
A potential concern in administering temozolomide
and everolimus together is the possibility of cumulative

toxicity. To reduce this risk, we limited the duration of
temozolomide to 6 months; in addition, all patients
received prophylaxis for pneumocystis pneumonia, given
prior reports of lymphopenia associated with temozolomide as well as the potential immunosuppressive effect of
everolimus.1,16 Encouragingly, we saw no serious opportunistic infections with this regimen. We did observe one
case of hepatitis B reactivation in a patient not previously
known to have hepatitis B infection. Reactivation of hepatitis B has been associated with the immunosuppressive
effects of everolimus,1 and screening should be
considered for patients with risk factors for infection with
hepatitis B.
Although most patients tolerated this regimen without difficulty, we did observe many of the anticipated toxicities of each drug. These included lymphopenia and
thrombocytopenia presumably related primarily to temozolomide, as well as anticipated side effects of everolimus
such as hyperglycemia, mild mucositis, and, less commonly, pneumonitis. It did not appear that the incidence
of these adverse events was any higher than would be
expected with either drug alone.
The optimal dosing schedule of temozolomide for
the treatment of advanced pancreatic NET remains an
open question. Our study represents the third prospective
study using a dose-intense regimen of temozolomide
administered at a dose of 150 mg/m2 daily for 7 days every
other week.12,13 Given the risk of long-term hematologic
toxicity with this regimen, we limited treatment duration
with temozolomide to 6 months. A commonly used combination of temozolomide and capecitabine has also been
shown to be active and uses a schedule in which temozolomide is administered at a dose of 200 mg/m2 for 5 days every 4 weeks.11 Most recently, activity was also observed
with a regimen incorporating low-dose, metronomic
temozolomide.14 Future studies more formally evaluating
the optimal dosing regimen for temozolomide in pancreatic NET are warranted. The tolerability of everolimus in
combination with dose-intense temozolomide observed
in our study, however, suggests that everolimus can also
be given in concert with temozolomide using these other
dosing regimens.
In conclusion, the randomized studies of sunitinib
and everolimus clearly demonstrate benefit associated
with these targeted agents in patients with advanced
pancreatic NET. Similar randomized data does not exist
currently for temozolomide. However, patients with a
high tumor burden or symptoms related to bulk of
disease may benefit from treatment with a cytotoxic
agent due to the higher response rates associated with

temozolomide-based regimens and other alkylating
agents compared with either sunitinib or everolimus.
Our study demonstrates that these patients can be safely
and effectively treated with a combination of temozolomide and everolimus. Future studies evaluating the
optimal dosing schedule of temozolomide and how
much might be gained with regard to response rate and
progression-free survival duration with combination
therapy compared to treatment with either agent alone
are warranted.
