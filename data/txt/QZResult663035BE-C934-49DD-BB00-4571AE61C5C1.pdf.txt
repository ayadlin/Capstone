Abstract

HHMI Author Manuscript

Epithelial integrity in metazoan organs is maintained through the regulated proliferation and
differentiation of organ-specific stem and progenitor cells. Although the epithelia of organs such
as the intestine regenerate constantly and thus remain continuously proliferative1, other organs,
such as the mammalian urinary bladder, shift from near-quiescence to a highly proliferative state
in response to epithelial injury2–4. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this injuryinduced mode of regenerative response are poorly defined. Here we show in mice that the
proliferative response to bacterial infection or chemical injury within the bladder is regulated by
signal feedback between basal cells of the urothelium and the stromal cells that underlie them. We
demonstrate that these basal cells include stem cells capable of regenerating all cell types within
the urothelium, and are marked by expression of the secreted protein signal Sonic hedgehog (Shh).
On injury, Shh expression in these basal cells increases and elicits increased stromal expression of
Wnt protein signals, which in turn stimulate the proliferation of both urothelial and stromal cells.
The heightened activity of this signal feedback circuit and the associated increase in cell
proliferation appear to be required for restoration of urothelial function and, in the case of
bacterial injury, may help clear and prevent further spread of infection. Our findings provide a
conceptual framework for injury-induced epithelial regeneration in endodermal organs, and may
provide a basis for understanding the roles of signalling pathways in cancer growth and metastasis.
The multi-layered bladder epithelium consists of a lumenal layer of fully differentiated,
usually binucleate umbrella cells5, which overlie intermediate cells with limited proliferative
potential, and long-term label-retaining basal cells able to produce large colonies on culture
in vitro6. These urothelial layers are separated by a basement membrane from the lamina
propria, a thin layer of fibroblast-like stromal cells, and submucosal, smooth muscle and

serous layers. Infections of the urinary tract, occurring in 10% of women annually7, are a
common cause of injury to the bladder, and can be modelled in mice by infection with
uropathogenic bacteria isolated from patients2,3,8.

HHMI Author Manuscript

To establish baseline parameters of the bladder regenerative response, we induced injury in
female mice by transurethral instillation of UTI89 (Supplementary Figs 1, 2a, 3a, b), a
uropathogenic strain of Escherichia coli, or of the injurious compound protamine sulphate
(PS). We found that expression of the proliferative marker Ki67 increased from near zero to
72% of epithelial and 28% of stromal cells within 24 h of UTI89 infection (Fig. 1a,
b).Thenumber of urothelial cell layers and total cells expressing the basal cell marker
cytokeratin 5 (Ck5, also known as Krt5) was markedly expanded (Supplementary Fig. 3c,
d), suggesting that injury-induced proliferation occurs primarily in basal urothelial cells.
Instillation of increasing PS concentrations also induced Ki67 expression, reaching a plateau
of ~35% at 20 mg ml−1 PS and above (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 4); Ck5-positive cell
number increased more modestly with PS injury. Interestingly, stromal cells showed no
increased proliferation, even at PS concentrations that saturate the epithelial response (Fig.
1c).

HHMI Author Manuscript

Shh is expressed in and has a role in development of urogenital sinus derivatives, including
bladder and prostate9–11. In the adult urothelium, we found that Shh is expressed primarily
in Ck5-positive basal cells, as indicated by immunostaining and GFP expression in a ShhGFP BAC transgenic strain (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 5a). Hedgehog (Hh) pathway
activity, indicated by a reporter Gli1-LacZ strain12 (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b), is restricted
to stromal, submucosal and muscle layers, outside the urothelium(Fig. 1e), and depends on
the Shh signal, as indicated by reduced Gli1 and Ptc (also known as Ptch1) expression on
treatment with a Shh-blocking antibody (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c).
Shh and Gli1 mRNA levels both increased in response to injury (Supplementary Fig. 5d and
Supplementary Table 3), and Shh protein expression extended to multiple layers of Ki67positive epithelial cells, including basal cells and Ck5-positive basal-like cells that result
from injury-induced proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 5e). Shh response was augmented by
injury, requiring only four instead of twenty hours of X-gal staining for detection in Gli1LacZ reporter mice, but nevertheless remained confined to the stromal compartment
(Supplementary Fig. 5f).

HHMI Author Manuscript

Basal cells have been suggested to function as stem cells in many epithelia including bladder
and prostate6,13; we marked Shh-expressing cells in vivo using a CreER tamoxifendependent site-specific recombinase expressed under the control of the Shh promoter
(ShhCreER)14 in combination with R26mTmG, a Cre-sensitive bi-fluorescent reporter15. In
ShhCreER/WT; R26mTmG/WT mice, the membrane-associated tomato fluorescent protein (mT)
is expressed until tamoxifen (TM) injection (Supplementary Figs 2b, 7a), after which
membrane-associated GFP (mG) marks Shh-expressing Ck5-positive cells in basal
urothelium (Supplementary Fig. 8a). With three rounds of bacterial injury and recovery after
TM injection (Supplementary Fig. 2b), mG labelled all or most urothelial cells including
Ck5-positive basal cells, intermediate cells, and Ck5-negative luminal umbrella cells marked
by expression of uroplakin 3 (ref. 16; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Figs 7c, 8a), indicating
multipotency of Shh-expressing cells. With reducedTMtreatment and a single round of
bacterial injury, we observed less extensive marking in isolated, vertically coherent patches
that included basal, intermediate and luminal cells (data not shown); overall regeneration
thus appears to result from the combined activation of many local urothelial units.
We found similar labelling in the majority of the urotheliumin mice carrying marked Shhexpressing cells and subjected to seven cycles of bacterial infection and recovery over a

period of 10 months (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 8b). This persistence through lengthy
and repeated periods of intense proliferation suggests that Shh-expressing cells have a
capacity for self-renewal. Similarly marked cells traced through a 10-month period without
injury produced less extensive labelling that nevertheless included Ck5-positive and Ck5negative cells (Supplementary Fig. 8c, d), indicating that Shh-expressing cells also
participate in regular homeostatic turnover in the absence of injury.
Similar experiments using Gli1-CreER17 to mark Shh-responsive stromal cells revealed that
mG expression marks most cells of the lamina propria, and no urothelial cells
(Supplementary Figs 7b, 9a, b). We also timed TM administration such that cells were
marked during the proliferative response to injury, and noted no injury-induced plasticity
with regard to segregation of Shh and Gli1 expression within epithelial and stromal
compartments, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 10a–c).

EnhancedGFP(eGFP)-positive cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
from the bladders of TM-injected ShhCreER/WT; R26mTmG/WT mice (WT, wild type;
Supplementary Figs 2c, 11a, b) formed spheres within 2 weeks of culture in suspension or in
Matrigel (Supplementary Fig. 11a–d). Approximately 5–6%of isolated cells formed primary
spheres in culture, with most of the remaining cells dying rapidly, probably as a result of
stress resulting from the isolation procedure; about 30–40% of cells within primary spheres
were able to form secondary spheres in subsequent cultures (Supplementary Fig. 11e, f).
After 5–7 weeks of culture in Matrigel, single Shh-expressing cells formed cyst-like
organoids 700–1,000 µm in diameter that resemble the bladder in containing multiple layers
of epithelial cells with Ck5- and Shh-expressing cells in the outer layer that contacts the
extracellular matrix, and inner cells that line a luminal space and express neither Ck5 nor
Shh (Fig. 2c–e, Supplementary Fig. 11g, i and Supplementary Movie 1). Single cells from
these organoids were capable of self-renewing by generating new organoids in subsequent
cultures (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 11h, j and Supplementary Movie 2). Our in vivo and
in vitro evidence thus indicates that Shh-expressing basal urothelial cells include multipotent
stem cells that are capable of self-renewal and differentiation.

HHMI Author Manuscript

The Gli1 member of the Gli family of transcriptional effectors that mediate transcriptional
response to Hh signalling (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b), although not essential for viability or
fertility12, can contribute significantly to pathway activity. For example, the incidence of
medulloblastoma in Ptc+/− mice is reduced ~10-fold on deletion of the Gli1 gene18. We
found that epithelial proliferation induced by UTI89 instillation was nearly absent in Gli1
mutant bladders at the 24–48 h peak of wild-type proliferation, with no additional layers of
basal-like cells; a later peak in proliferation was ~1/2 of the wild-type maximum (Fig. 3a, b
and Supplementary Fig. 12a). Proliferation of stromal cells was also affected in Gli1
mutants, with a similar delay and decrease in Ki67 expression (Fig. 3a, b). Injection of a
Shh-blocking antibody reduced expression of pathway targets Gli1 and Ptc (Supplementary
Fig. 5b, c), and correspondingly reduced proliferative responses in both epithelial and
stromal compartments (Supplementary Fig. 12b–d and Supplementary Table 5). The
response to chemical injury was also markedly reduced in Gli1 mutants (Fig. 3c and
Supplementary Fig. 13a, b), and these results together indicate that stromal Gli1-mediated
response to the epithelial Shh signal promotes proliferative activity in response to both
chemical and bacterial injury.
We tested the role of proliferation in restoring urothelial integrity by instilling fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated dextran after UTI89-mediated injury in wild-type and
Gli1 mutants. At 6 h after infection, by which time umbrella cells have exfoliated8, wildtype and mutant bladders both showed penetration of FITC-dextran into interstitial spaces of

the urothelium (not shown); at 24 h, however, wild-type but not mutant bladders had reestablished exclusion of FITC-dextran from extracellular spaces (Fig. 3d).

HHMI Author Manuscript

We also found that, although bacterial titres were somewhat lower in the bladders of
infected Gli1 mutant mice (Fig. 3e), the kidneys of mutant mice contained more than tenfold
higher numbers of bacteria (Fig. 3e). These findings indicate that in addition to helping
restore epithelial integrity, rapid proliferation of urothelial cells during normal regeneration
may help reduce the risk of bacterial spread from the bladder to the kidneys, perhaps by
competing for adhesive interactions that otherwise might aid in bacterial ascent via the
ureters to the kidneys19.
The requirement for stromal Gli1 in mediating proliferative response to epithelial injury
suggested the possibility of Shh/Gli1-dependent transcription of secreted signals within the
stroma. From gene expression profiles (data not shown) and quantitative polymerase chain
reaction with reverse transcription (RT–PCR) with RNA from injured and uninjured wildtype or Gli1 mutant bladders, we found that Wnt2, Wnt4 and Fgf16 showed significant
injury- and Gli1- dependent responses (Supplementary Fig. 14a, b). With RNA isolated from
stromal and epithelial compartments using laser capture micro-dissection (LCM;
Supplementary Fig. 15a, b), we found that levels of Wnt2, Wnt4 and Fgf16 transcripts
increased with injury only in the stroma (Fig. 4a).

HHMI Author Manuscript

For further analysis we isolated basal, intermediate and umbrella cell layers from uninjured
wild-type or Gli1 mutant bladders (Supplementary Fig. 15c, d); as umbrella cells were
absent from regenerating bladders owing to bacterially induced exfoliation, we isolated a
single lumenal layer of intermediate cells, a single layer of Ck5-positive basal cells and two
layers of Ck5-positive basal-like cells (basal-like1 and basal-like2) from wild type (Fig. 4b
and Supplementary Fig. 15e) or, from Gli1 homozygous mutants, intermediate cells and a
single layer of basal cells (Supplementary Fig. 15f). With RNA from these microdissected
cell layers we found that transcription of Axin2, a universal indicator of Wnt signal
response20,21, increased markedly in stromal cells and in basal and basal-like1 cells, to a
lesser extent in the second basal-like2 layer, and not at all in the intermediate cell layer (Fig.
4c). No increase in Axin2 levels could be seen in stromal or urothelial layers of injured,
Gli1-mutant bladders (Fig. 4c). Increased Wnt response thus occurs in stromal cells and in
urothelial cell layers in closest proximity to the stromal source of Wnt signals.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Shh expression also increased in basal and basal-like cells (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig.
16), indicating stromal Gli1-mediated positive feedback on epithelial Shh expression.
Notably, however, Shh expression in basal cells also increased somewhat in the Gli1 mutant,
indicating an injury-induced effect on Shh expression that does not require Gli1-mediated
feedback from the stroma.
We tested pharmacological modulators of Wnt signalling, and found that indomethacin
treatment reduced Axin2 transcripts twofold in the bladder (Supplementary Fig. 17a),
indicating a reduction in Wnt response20, and correspondingly suppressed UTI89-induced
proliferation in the epithelium and stroma (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 17b). We also
found that LiCl22 increased Axin2 transcripts (Supplementary Fig. 17a), and
correspondingly induced proliferation in the epithelium and stroma of uninjured wild-type
mice or substantially rescued the proliferative response of Gli1 mutant mice (Fig. 4e and
Supplementary Fig. 17c, d). We also observed a marked enhancement of the proliferative
response to instillation of 2 mgml−1 PS, from ~5% to 30% in the epithelium and from 0 to
~15% in the stroma (Supplementary Fig. 18a, b), in mice heterozygous for the Apcmin
mutation, which show constitutive Wnt pathway activity due to reduced dosage of a
negative Wnt response regulator23 (Supplementary Fig. 18c).

We inactivated the Wnt response with a homozygous conditional allele of the essential Wnt
pathway component b-catenin (also known as Ctnnb1), and found that ablation in TMinjected mice by the ubiquitously expressed CAG-CreER reduced Axin2 expression in
injured bladder (Supplementary Fig. 18d) and correspondingly reduced injury-induced
proliferation in both epithelial and stromal compartments (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig.
18e). In contrast, the proliferation defect produced in ShhCreER/WT; β-cateninflox/flox mice
was restricted to basal epithelium (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Fig. 18f). Our
pharmacological and genetic data indicate a role for Wnt pathway activity within basal
epithelial and stromal cells in the activation of proliferative responses, with the potential role
and importance of Fgf or other Hh-induced stromal signals remaining to be explored.
Our findings, summarized schematically in Supplementary Fig. 19, reveal an essential
contribution by Hh and Wnt signals acting across the epithelial–stromal boundary during
bladder regeneration, and are reminiscent of the well-studied Drosophila embryonic
segment, in which Hh and Wingless signalling across the parasegment boundary are
essential for segmental patterning during development. Interestingly, however, Hh/Wnt
feedback signalling in the Drosophila segment operates to specify future pattern within an
undifferentiated epithelium, whereas in the bladder it functions to maintain differentiated
structures in a mature organ.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Surprisingly, despite its dispensability for normal development, Gli1 contributes
significantly to bladder regeneration, thus providing a useful tool to demonstrate a role of
regenerative proliferation not only in restoring urothelial integrity but also in preventing
bacterial spread to the kidneys. Further studies will be required to determine whether Gli1
also contributes to the regeneration of other organs in which Hh signalling has a role11,24;
such flexibility in Gli1 transcriptional output would be consistent with the apparent
flexibility of Gli1 in mediating qualitatively distinct responses to bacterial and chemical
bladder injury, which differ markedly in the presence or absence of stromal cell
proliferation.

As many as 10% of women experience infections of the urinary tract in a year7,25, including
cystitis and pyelonephritis, and ~26% of urinary tract infections recur within six months26.
Recent work has demonstrated that intracellular reservoirs of bacteria can form in umbrella
cells or in transitional cells3, and exfoliation of infected cells harbouring intracellular
bacterial reservoirs induced by PS or other agents has been suggested as potentially
beneficial in clearing these infections. Our current data suggest that it may also be worth
exploring the effect of more directly activating the Wnt signalling pathway by treating with
LiCl; on the other hand use of drugs such as indomethacin, which inhibit the regenerative
response in the urothelium, may be contraindicated.
Another clinical arena in which our findings may be relevant is the growth and
dissemination of cancers in which Hh ligand production in primary cells of the tumour
triggers pathway activity in tumour stroma, which then expands and supports the growth of
primary cells within the tumour27,28. This tumour–stromal interaction might now be viewed
as the growth-enhancing activation of a feedback circuit normally triggered by injury.
Tumour–stromal interactions are also critical in metastasis, and the preferential colonization
of particular tissues by individual tumour types might be determined by the competence of
target tissues to respond to eliciting signals from the tumour cells, similar to the epithelial–
stromal interaction noted here in bladder regeneration. In this connection it is interesting to
note that tumours of the prostate, which like the bladder is a derivative of the urogenital
sinus and also requires Hh pathway activity for its regeneration11, metastasize most
commonly to bone, lung and liver29, a preference very similar to that of bladder tumours,
which metastasize most commonly to liver, lung and bone30. Further work will be required

activities may be in cancer growth and metastasis.

METHODS
Mice

Gli1LacZ/WT heterozygotes12 from our colony were interbred to generate Gli1LacZ/LacZ
homozygotes. Heterozygous and wild-type littermates were used as controls. Female mice
between 6 and 10 weeks of age were used for all injury experiments. Shh-GFP BAC strain
was obtained from the GENSAT project at Rockefeller University. For lineage tracing
experiments, ShhCreER/WT, or Gli1CreER/WT mice14,17 were crossed with R26mTmG/mTmG
strain15 to obtain ShhCreER/WT; R26mTmG/WT, or Gli1CreER/WT; R26mTmG/WT. ShhCreER/WT
or CAG-CreER were crossed with β-cateninflox/flox mice to obtain ShhCreER/WT; βcateninflox/WT or CAG-CreER; β-cateninflox/WT. Resulting mice were crossed with βcateninflox/flox mice to obtain ShhCreER/WT; β-cateninflox/flox or CAG-CreER; βcateninflox/flox. All mouse strains except as otherwise indicated were obtained from Jackson
Laboratories. All bladder instillation procedures were performed under isoflurane
anaesthesia, which was administered in a fume hood with a standard vaporizer (J. B. Baulch
and Associates). All procedures were performed under a protocol approved by the
Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care at Stanford University.

Bacterial and chemical injury
For bacterial injury, a uropathogenic E. coli(UPEC) strain, UTI89, was grown for 16 h in a
static culture, and inoculated via transurethral instillation of anaesthetized female mice at a
concentration of 107 c.f.u. in 50 µl as previously described2. Animals were maintained after
infection for the indicated period of time or urine was collected after 4 h to confirm
infection. For chemical injury, 50 µl of PS (Sigma) solution in PBS at 2 mg ml−1, 10 mg
ml−1, 20 ml ml−1 or 40 mg ml−1 was delivered transurethrally as indicated. Bladders were
collected and analysed at distinct time-points after instillation.
Lineage tracing studies

HHMI Author Manuscript

For fate mapping of Shh-expressing cells before bacterial injury, ShhCreER/WT;
R26mTmG/WT or Gli1CreER/WT; R26mTmG/WT mouse strains were injected intraperitoneally
with 4mg of TM (per 30 g body weight) daily for three consecutive days. Seven days after
the last TM injection, mice were subjected to three transurethral instillations of UTI89 with
10-day intervals after the first and second infections, and 15 days after the third. Mice were
killed and bladders then dissected for further analysis. For labelling of Shh- or Gli1expressing cells before injury, mice were injected with TM (4 mg per 30 g body weight) for
3 days and analysed 5 days after the last injection. For lineage tracing of Shh or Gli1
expressing cells during injury, ShhCreER/WT; R26mTmG/WT or Gli1CreER/WT; R26mTmG/WT
mice were injected intraperitoneally with 4 mg of TM (per 30 g body weight) for 5
consecutive days, starting 2 days before infections to allow enough time for tamoxifen to be
absorbed by the bladder. Six days after the last injection of TM, the entire procedure was
repeated. Tissue sections were prepared 6 days after final injection of TM for further
analysis. For long-term lineage tracing, ShhCreER/WT; R26mTmG/WT mouse strains were
injected intraperitoneally with 4 mg of TM(per 30 g bodyweight) daily for 3 consecutive
days. Seven days after the last TM injection, mice were subjected to seven transurethral
instillations of UTI89, twice a month for 2 months and once a month for next 3 months. Five
months after the last instillation, mice were killed and bladders then dissected for further
analysis. For long-term lineage tracing experiments to study homeostasis, ShhCreER/WT;
R26mTmG/WT mouse strains were injected with 4mg of TM (per 30 g body weight) daily for
3 consecutive days, and bladders were analysed 10 months after the last TM injection.

In vitro culture of Shh-expressing cells

HHMI Author Manuscript
HHMI Author Manuscript

To isolate Shh-expressing cells, ShhCreER/WT; R26mTmG/WT mouse strains were injected
intraperitoneally with 4 mg of TM (per 30 g body weight) daily for 3 consecutive days.
Three days after TM injection, bladders were collected, inverted and inflated as described
previously31. Inverted bladders were incubated in 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA containing 500 U
ml−1 collagenase for 2 h at 37 °C. Tissues were then minced and, after the lysis of red blood
cells, a single-cell suspension was obtained by 10 min of trituration, followed by filtration
through 40-µm cell strainers. Cells were sorted using a FACS AriaII cytometer (BD
Biosciences), and analysis of flow cytometry data was performed using FlowJo Software
(Treestar). Sorted cells were cultured in Ultra Low attachment plates (Corning) for
suspension culture in media containing 1:1 mixture of conditioned media and
DMEM(Invitrogen) supplemented with 50 ng ml−1 EGF (PeproTech). Conditioned medium
was prepared by growing 90% confluent V79 lung fibroblast-derived cells (ATCC) in
DMEM with 5% FBS for 24 h. For Matrigel culture, a single-cell suspension was mixed
with 200 µl of ice-cold Matrigel (reduced growth factors; BD Bioscience), layered onto 12mm Transwell clear filters, and allowed to solidify at 37 °C. Pre-warmed growth medium
was added above and below the gel and cells were grown until the time of analysis. For
passaging organoids in Matrigel culture, organoids were released from Matrigel matrix by
depolymerizing Matrigel using MatriSphere Cell Recovery Solution (BD Bioscience)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Organoids were then dissociated into single
cells by incubating with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA for 30 min, followed by 5 min of trituration.
Cells were then seeded in Matrigel as described earlier.
Antibody injection
Mice were injected intraperitoneally with either anti-mouse Shh antibody or isotype control
(5E1 and 6B3, respectively; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) daily for 7 days.
Mice received 10 mg kg−1 body weight of antibody for the first 3 days and 5 mg kg−1 body
weight thereafter. Bladders were dissected on the last day of injection to isolate RNA for
qRT–PCR analysis. For assays of proliferation, mice were injected with 10 mg antibody per
kg body weight daily for 3 days, and 5 mg antibody per kg body weight thereafter. Mice
were infected with UTI89 on the fourth day of antibody injection.
Microscopy and laser capture microdissection

HHMI Author Manuscript

All images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM510 inverted confocalmicroscope and prepared
for publication with Zeiss LSM 5 Image Browser software and Adobe Photoshop CS3.
Three-dimensional reconstructions of confocal images were generated using Imaris software
(Bitplane Scientific Software). For LCM, bladder sections were prepared using an LCM
staining kit (Ambion) and a Leica LMD6000 Laser Microdissection Microscope.
Quantitative RT–PCR
For qRT–PCR, bladders were frozen in liquid nitrogen and total RNAs isolated from frozen
bladder tissue using RNeasy Plus Mini (Qiagen). qRT–PCR was performed using iScript
one-step RT–PCR kit with SYBR Green and the Bio-Rad iCycler (BioRad). Assays were
performed on bladders from six animals, and all values normalized to the GAPDH internal
control, which does not vary on injury (data not shown). For material isolated by LCM, total
RNA was prepared using RNAqueous-Micro RNA isolation kit (Ambion).
Indomethacin and LiCl treatment
Mice were injected with 2.5 mgkg−1 of body weight with indomethacin or DMSO vehicle
control every 12 h throughout the experiment20. UTI89 was instilled 36 h after initial
indomethacin injection, and bladders were analysed on the third day, 60 h after the initial

indomethacin injection. For LiCl treatment, wild-type or Gli1LacZ/LacZ mice received either
200 mg kg−1 of body weight of LiCl in 100 µl of deionized water or 100 µl of deionized
water as a vehicle control every day for 3 days by oral gavage. At the time of oral gavage,
mice were also injected transurethrally with 40 mg kg−1 of body weight of LiCl. UTI89
infection was performed at 30 h after initial LiCl treatment, and bladders were analysed on
the third day, 54 h after initial LiCl treatment.
Conditional ablation of β-catenin

ShhCreER/WT; β-cateninflox/flox or CAG-CreER; β-cateninflox/flox female mice were injected
intraperitoneally with 4 mg of TM (per 30 g body weight) daily for 3 consecutive days. For
CAG-CreER; β-cateninflox/flox, bladder was inoculated with UTI89 the day after the last
injection of TM, and bladders were collected 24 h after infection. For ShhCreER/WT; βcateninflox/flox, bladder was inoculated with UTI89 3 days after the last injection of TM, and
collected 24 h after infection.
In vivo permeability assay
10 mg ml−1 of FITC-dextran (10000MW, Invitrogen) in a 50 ml volume of PBS32 was
injected transurethrally into the bladder lumen 1.5 h before collection of bladders at the
indicated time points. Bladder sections were made and analysed for FITC.

HHMI Author Manuscript

Bacterial titration and analysis of urine
Urine from infected bladders was collected 6 h after UTI89 infection, and slides were
prepared and stained for analysis using Cytospin and Hema3 staining kit (Fisher). Kidneys
and bladders were dissected from wild-type littermate controls or Gli1LacZ/LacZ mice 24 h
after infection. Tissues were homogenized in 1 ml of PBS, and bacterial titres were
determined by microtitre-plate dilution on LB plates2.
X-gal histochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis

HHMI Author Manuscript

Bladders were dissected and embedded in OCT compound for snap freezing (Tissue-Tek).
Frozen blocks were sectioned at 10-µm intervals using a Microm cryostat. For X-gal
staining, frozen sections were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS containing 5mM EGTA
and 2 mM MgCl2 for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing twice with PBS containing 2 mM
MgCl2, sections were incubated with 1 mg ml−1 of X-gal solution in PBS containing 0.02%
NP40, 0.01% deocycholic acid, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM C6FeK3N6, 5 mM
C6FeK4N6 for 4 h to overnight. Stained sections were counterstained with eosin solution
(Sigma). For immunostaining, frozen tissue sections were fixed in 4% of paraformaldehyde
for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing three times with PBS, tissue sections were blocked in 2%
goat serum in PBS containing 0.25% Trion X-100 for 1 h, incubated with the following
primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber:
rat anti-Shh (R&D, 1:200); rabbit anti-Ki67 (Abcam, 1:500); rabbit anti-Ck5 (Abcam,

were washed three times with PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100, incubated with DAPI
and appropriate Alexa fluoro 488, 594, or 633 conjugated secondary antibodies diluted
1:1,000 in blocking solution for 2 h at 22 °C, washed again three times, and mounted on
slides with Prolong Gold mounting reagent (Invitrogen). For immunostaining of organoids,
Matrigel plugs were removed from the filter supports of Transwell plates, washed with PBS,
and incubated with MatriSphere Cell Recovery Solution (BD Bioscience) for 20 min to
partially dissolve the Matrigel. Subsequently, the gel-embedded bladder organoids were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C, followed by washing three times with
PBS. Fixed organoids then were permeablized in 0.25% Triton X-100 for 30 min, followed
by incubation in blocking solution of 2% goat serum in PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100

for 1 h. Organoids were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution
for 2 days at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. After three washes, bladder organoids were
incubated with secondary antibody overnight in 4 °C, followed by three washes and
mounting on Coverwell chamber (Grace Bio-Lab) with Prolong Gold mounting reagent
(Invitrogen).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software v.5. All data are
presented as mean ± s.e.m., and two group comparisons were done with a two-tailed
Student’s t-test. A value of P < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant.

Figure 1. Injury-induced proliferation and Hedgehog signalling in the bladder

a, UTI89 instillation induces proliferation of basal epithelial and stromal cells of the bladder.
Ki67, Ck5 and laminin immunostaining highlight proliferation, basal epithelial cells and the
basement membrane, respectively, in bladders 24 h after instillation of UTI89. Adjacent
sections were 10 mm apart. b, Quantification of epithelial and stromal cell proliferation in
response to bacterial injury. Ki67-positive cells are shown as a per cent of total 4′,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-staining nuclei. c, Quantification of epithelial and stromal
cell proliferation in response to chemical injury. Ki67-positive cells are shown as a per cent
of total DAPI-staining nuclei 24 h after instillation of the indicated concentrations of PS.
Note the absence of a proliferative response in the stroma. For panels b and c, data are from

Figure 2. Shh-expressing basal cells repopulate the urothelium and form organoids in vitro

HHMI Author Manuscript

a, eGFP-marked Shh-expressing cells generate luminal cells positive for uroplakin 3.
ShhCreER/WT; R26mTmG/WT mice were treated with TM and subjected to three rounds of
injury. Uroplakin-3-positive and negative cells are denoted by white arrows and arrowheads,
respectively. Dotted lines demarcate urothelium and stroma (L, lumen; S, stroma). b, Longterm regenerative capacity of eGFP-marked Shh-expressing cells. After TM injection and
seven rounds of injury over 10 months, mG expression in bladder from ShhCreER/WT;
R26mTmG/WT mice marks most urothelial cells. See Supplementary Fig. 2b for experimental
schemes. c, Extended culture of Shh-expressing cells in Matrigel. Single eGFP-positive
bladder cells isolated from TM-injected ShhCreER/WT; R26mTmG/WT mice and cultured in
Matrigel for 5 weeks formed organoids. Dissociated cells from primary culture (P0)
organoids also generated new organoids on subsequent passage (P1) in Matrigel culture.
DIC, differential interference contrast. d, Confocal analysis of a bladder organoid. The
organoid has multiple layers of epithelial cells with Ck5-expressing cells in the outer layer
that contacts the extracellular matrix, and inner cells that line a luminal space and do not
express Ck5. e, A section through the wall of an organoid grown in Matrigel and
immunostained for Shh. Note eGFP expression in all cells, indicative of Shh expression in
the cell initially cultured, but loss of Shh immunostaining from cells that are not in the outer
layer. Scale bars represent 50 µm; asterisks denote organoid lumen.

Figure 3. Gli1 mediates injury-induced proliferation, restoration of urothelial integrity and
reduction of infectious spread

HHMI Author Manuscript

a, Gli1 loss delays and attenuates proliferative response to bacterial injury. Bladders from
wild-type or homozygous Gli1 mutant mice were analysed at the indicated times after
UTI89 instillation by immunostaining for Ki67 and laminin. b, Quantification of Gli1 effect
on epithelial and stromal cell proliferation. Ki67-positive cells are shown as a per cent of
total DAPI-staining nuclei at the indicated times after UTI89 instillation in wild-type and
Gli1 mutant bladders. c, Gli1 loss blocks the proliferative response of epithelial cells to
chemical injury. Ki67-positive cells are shown as a per cent of total DAPI-staining nuclei 24
h after instillation of the indicated concentrations of PS. In panels b and c, data are shown as
mean ± s.e.m. from 3 bladders, 2 sections each, and numerical data are shown in
Supplementary Tables 4 and 6, respectively. d, Paracellular permeability in injured bladders
from Gli1 mutant mice. Bladders from wild-type and Gli1 homozygotes were instilled with
UTI89 and analysed at the times indicated after infection, with FITC-dextran instillation
preceding bladder collection by 1.5 h. Dotted lines demarcate the border between urothelium
and stroma. Note that normal reduced levels of paracellular permeability are restored by 24
h in wild-type but not Gli1 homozygotes. e, Infectious spread to kidneys is enhanced by Gli1
loss. Bacterial titres 24 h after UTI89 instillation were lower in bladders from Gli1
homozygotes as compared to wild-type (6.6 ± 3.27 × 106 versus 3.2 ± 1.03 ± 107 colonyforming units (c.f.u.); P < 0.05). In contrast, bacterial titres were significantly higher in
kidneys from Gli1 homozygotes as compared to wild-type (2.59 ± 1.0 × 105 versus 2.55 ±
1.0 × 104; P < 0.05). Data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. (10 mice), and significance was
calculated by an unpaired Student’s t-test. Scale bars represent 50 µm.

a, Wnt2, Wnt4 and Fgf16 expression in microdissected epithelium or stroma. Stromal
expression of Wnt2, Wnt4 and Fgf16 increased significantly on injury. Although Wnt4 RNA
was detected in the epithelium, this expression did not increase on injury. ND, not detected.
b, Laser capture microdissection of urothelial cell layers in regenerating bladder. Red,
yellow, green and black lines illustrate selection and outlining of cells in basal (Bas), basallike 1 (Bsl1), basal-like 2 (Bsl2), and intermediate (Int) layers, respectively, before
microdissection. c, d, Axin2 and Shh expression in microdissected cell layers from wildtype and Gli1 mutant bladders 24 h after instillation of UTI89 or PBS. c, Expression of
Axin2 increased 5.5 fold in stroma (P < 0.05), and 6.3 fold in basal (P < 0.05), 5.9 fold in
basal-like 1 (P < 0.05), and 2.3 fold in basal-like 2 (P < 0.01) as compared to uninjured basal
cells. Expression of Axin2 did not change significantly in basal and intermediate cells of
injured Gli1 homozygous mutants as compared to basal and intermediate cells of uninjured
Gli1 mutant bladder. d, Expression of Shh in cells increased 5.5 fold in basal (P < 0.01), 5.7
fold in basal-like 1 (P < 0.05), and 2.1 fold in basal-like 2 (P < 0.05) as compared to
uninjured basal cells. Expression of Shh in Gli1 homozygous mutants increased 3 fold (P <
0.05) in injured as compared to uninjured basal epithelial cells. Data are presented as mean ±
s.e.m., and significance was calculated by a paired Student’s t-test. Str, stroma; Umb,
umbrella cells. e, Modulation of Wnt pathway activity in regenerative response to bacterial
injury. Left, pharmacological reduction (indomethacin (Indo)) or augmentation (LiCl) of the
Wnt signal response respectively decreases or increases bladder proliferation, with or
without bacterial injury, as shown, in mice of the indicated genotype (see also
Supplementary Fig. 17b, c, d). Right, tamoxifen-induced inactivation of β-catenin decreases
proliferation in epithelium and stroma (CAG-CreER) or in epithelium (ShhCreER). Data are
presented as mean ± s.e.m. from 3 bladders, 2 sections each (see also Supplementary Fig.
18e, f).
